I first read about this in Nimzowitsch's book called My System. By taking control of b4 you're indirectly supporting the c5 square for a minor piece. White will then have to try and bolster the b4 square with moves like Rb1, if he's ever going to shift a Knight from c5. My plan here is simply to kill off any play that white may have on the queenside by re-routing my Queen's Knight to c5 and advancing the a-pawn to a4, if white allows this then I think black will be close to winning.

I did not like 24. g3 at all. It creates all sorts of problems for Caruana. It allows multiple threats such as f3 and Bh3. Black eventually can bring the Rook to f6 then h6. Too many problems! Too hard to fend off everything!
This is why I tried to explain and many fans simply refuse to believe. When players are in immense pressure, they start to see things that are not there. Nerves can play tricks in humans' minds. If Caruana is playing a 2000 player, he would not hesitate to capture on b5."

The most common move here is 11. Nd2, played by Petrosian before in the 60's. If black plays 11...dxc4 then White has a comfortable position. 
However, if 11...d4 it can lead to interesting complications where Black sacrifices a piece. So this is why Carlsen is trying to decide how to proceed here.
Carlsen usually prefers quiet position advantage then squeeze while Caruana excels more in dynamic positions. So Carlsen must decide what type of game will he allow. This is all about match strategy, and sometimes Carlsen is known to play inferior moves just to shift the dynamic of the positions."

I cannot say 100% but most GMs would never offer a draw with Black, which has very little risk. This is simply shocking! ♟ All 12 games are drawn! This has to change! @FIDE_chess needs to change this rule! No draw offer should be allowed! There is no draw offer in , ping pong , boxing , MMA & other sports. Fighting draw is no problem. But not because one’s nerves is shot! Am I wrong?  As I said in the beginning, the players will do what they think is best for them. They do not care about styles to please the fans. Carlsen came into this game wanting a draw. He offered to repeat early on. Caruana refused. Then he offered draw in better position + more time! ♟  Caruana would be crazy not to accept the draw offer in that position with such little time. Since Carlsen seems to have lost his ability to calculate deep lines, he is much more suited for FASTER time control where chess instinct is more important. That was the game plan.♟ Based on statistics, Carlsen is the favorite in faster time control. But after his mindset & clearly fragile nerves, Caruana may surprise him, especially now that he’s just given a new chance. I can’t imagine any World Champion, male/female, would offer a draw in that position.♟ "

He has more than enough compensation for the temporary sacrificed pawns. All of a sudden, the tide has turned. After an inferior 17. c3, Caruana now has a problem finding good squares for his pieces. He has to be extremely careful and it is now Carlsen's turn to strike back. The momentum has shifted after the promising opening surprise.
After 18...Ra8, Caruana is spending a lot of time. He now realizes that in spite of being temporarily up 2 pawns, he could be in trouble. The best move now is 19. Bc3 but then his Knight has no place to go. A big mess! So the cause is 17. c3 His pieces are in a tight space."

Now, if Carlsen finds 20...b5, he will block the b4 pawn, and in a few moves, he can take it after f6 defending the e5 pawn, then Bf8. Then white will have problems dealing with the passed b pawn and Black's Bishop pair. "

Now Caruana will have time to consolidate and hold.

​I can understand Caruana's cautiousness before taking. He does not know if Carlsen has something up his sleeves or not. It does look scary with the Kingside attack, but a pawn is a pawn. It is NOT over as Black still has plenty of play left. Maybe too scary for Caruana to take?🤔

I did not like 24. g3 at all. It creates all sorts of problems for Caruana. It allows multiple threats such as f3 and Bh3. Black eventually can bring the Rook to f6 then h6. Too many problems! Too hard to fend off everything!
This is why I tried to explain and many fans simply refuse to believe. When players are in immense pressure, they start to see things that are not there. Nerves can play tricks in humans' minds. If Caruana is playing a 2000 player, he would not hesitate to capture on b5."

He is also playing against Caruana's team of seconds, Stockfish and Super Computers. From the time on the clock, it seems that Caruana is still in his element.
While Black is objectively OK here, in reality, Carlsen is in real pressure. He has no idea what else Caruana had cooked up at home. So he is trying to figure things out over the board knowing one mistake can cost him the World Championship title. Carlsen's struggle is real! One thing that really surprises me is why so many players insisting on repeating the same opening choice over & over again in World Championship matches. We saw how that worked out with Kasparov versus Kramnik as well as other matches. This plays into opponents' preparation advantage. Why not mix things up?"

Of course nothing is ever 100% correct because the other team also has surprises. So it is up to the players themselves, arm with all the preparation, to figure out where the potential home prep landmines are, then try to avoid it. 
This is why someone like Carlsen, who believes in his middlegame and endgame strength, prefers to go around deep theories, and just play chess.

The idea of Nf8 is to go to d7 to help solidify the c5 square.  This is NOT a good home prep game for Caruana as Carlsen is clearly dictating the pace. So either Carlsen thoroughly prepared for this or he is doing an amazing job bluffing Caruana. We will see ♟

I cannot say 100% but most GMs would never offer a draw with Black, which has very little risk. This is simply shocking! ♟ All 12 games are drawn! This has to change! @FIDE_chess needs to change this rule! No draw offer should be allowed! There is no draw offer in , ping pong , boxing , MMA & other sports. Fighting draw is no problem. But not because one’s nerves is shot! Am I wrong?  As I said in the beginning, the players will do what they think is best for them. They do not care about styles to please the fans. Carlsen came into this game wanting a draw. He offered to repeat early on. Caruana refused. Then he offered draw in better position + more time! ♟  Caruana would be crazy not to accept the draw offer in that position with such little time. Since Carlsen seems to have lost his ability to calculate deep lines, he is much more suited for FASTER time control where chess instinct is more important. That was the game plan.♟ Based on statistics, Carlsen is the favorite in faster time control. But after his mindset & clearly fragile nerves, Caruana may surprise him, especially now that he’s just given a new chance. I can’t imagine any World Champion, male/female, would offer a draw in that position.♟ "

Carlsen should not allow Bxb5 again. So b4 is important!"

But of course with little time, either player can make horrific blunders. So very far from finality! Very exciting for the fans though! 👏
I did not like 24. g3 at all. It creates all sorts of problems for Caruana. It allows multiple threats such as f3 and Bh3. Black eventually can bring the Rook to f6 then h6. Too many problems! Too hard to fend off everything!
This is why I tried to explain and many fans simply refuse to believe. When players are in immense pressure, they start to see things that are not there. Nerves can play tricks in humans' minds. If Caruana is playing a 2000 player, he would not hesitate to capture on b5."

While Black is objectively OK here, in reality, Carlsen is in real pressure. He has no idea what else Caruana had cooked up at home. So he is trying to figure things out over the board knowing one mistake can cost him the World Championship title. Carlsen's struggle is real!

I cannot say 100% but most GMs would never offer a draw with Black, which has very little risk. This is simply shocking! ♟ All 12 games are drawn! This has to change! @FIDE_chess needs to change this rule! No draw offer should be allowed! There is no draw offer in , ping pong , boxing , MMA & other sports. Fighting draw is no problem. But not because one’s nerves is shot! Am I wrong?  As I said in the beginning, the players will do what they think is best for them. They do not care about styles to please the fans. Carlsen came into this game wanting a draw. He offered to repeat early on. Caruana refused. Then he offered draw in better position + more time! ♟  Caruana would be crazy not to accept the draw offer in that position with such little time. Since Carlsen seems to have lost his ability to calculate deep lines, he is much more suited for FASTER time control where chess instinct is more important. That was the game plan.♟ Based on statistics, Carlsen is the favorite in faster time control. But after his mindset & clearly fragile nerves, Caruana may surprise him, especially now that he’s just given a new chance.

While 10...Rd8 is not a new move, according to my database Magnus never faced it before. That is why he is taking his time. 
The most common move here is 11. Nd2, played by Petrosian before in the 60's. If black plays 11...dxc4 then White has a comfortable position. 
However, if 11...d4 it can lead to interesting complications where Black sacrifices a piece. So this is why Carlsen is trying to decide how to proceed here.
Carlsen usually prefers quiet position advantage then squeeze while Caruana excels more in dynamic positions. So Carlsen must decide what type of game will he allow. This is all about match strategy, and sometimes Carlsen is known to play inferior moves just to shift the dynamic of the positions."
