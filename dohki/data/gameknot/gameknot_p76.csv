Here is one long struggle against a player called Cristiana (aka mantidereligiosa) from Master Skorpio's Group.  Cristiana mounted a very strong middlegame attack against Yours Truly who attracts passivitis like a fly to a leg of ham!  This attack gained two pawns.  I tried to restore the balance a little more in my favour by conceding two rooks and a few pawns and retaining the services of Glenda.  Glenda did her best but alas with the formation of the pawns it was impossible for her to get a draw through Ye Olde Perpetualle and I ended up resigning our game on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate  So how did this happen?

Well read on."
39,1,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',2. ..... f5 - this is a themed Welcome MT called The Dutch Defense.  Black counters in the centre by means of the f pawn.  Black must attend to the possibility of a queen check down the Fool's Mate diagonal.  However a timely knight move to f6 normally addresses this issue.

Now as an exercise I think we should have some answers on a postcard from the Inquest Jury as to exactly how this mate can be forced.  Anyhow as a result of my defeat Cristiana's rating soared into the 1900s (it is currently 1912 as I write) and has deservedly become a near-Expert.  Well played Cristiana!  I will be writing on another game of Cristiana's one of where she achieved a Master Draw against her mentor Skorpio Klaus very soon so watch this space!

In this game my opponent William gambits a pawn early on.  I manage to hold on to my advantage for a long time in this game but alas at a price - passivitis again sets in.  I then find myself in a real tactical knot.  However due to some very passive but defensive moves I manage to unravel the knot and avoid losing any material except the gambit pawn.  William realised that after the trade off of knights we would end up in a rook endgame with just our kingside pawns left.  On that understanding he offered me a draw of which I gratefully accepted.  So how did this happen?  Well read on ......."

William eschews playing into The Annotation Project which deals with a queen sac for two pieces.  The player with the queen would find himself suffering from passivitis and must work out how to escape from the bind.  However this does not happen in this game.

147,5,11,5Nh3,b'8/8/3k4/1p2n3/p2KP2p/P6N/1P6/8 b - -',This is the decisive mistake. As the note to move 53 shows the white knight is useful on f4 because it prevents the black king coming to e5 in view of the fork Ng6+. White should therefore retain this resource and instead play Dvoretsky's recommendation 55. Kc3! when it is not clear if Black can win. He can retain some pressure with 55. ... Kc5 (55 ... Ng6 56.

156,6,0,Nxf5,b'8/8/4k3/3n1n2/5P2/8/8/3K4 w - -',"This ending is one of the most technically fascinating in chess although it occurs rarely in practice. As is well known two knights cannot force mate against a bare king because at the crucial moment the defender's king will be stalemated. However if the defender has a pawn the stalemate does not arise so it is possible to force mate. Almost all of the research on this endgame was carried out by the legendary Russian analyst and study composer Alexey Troitzky in the early years of the 20th century. Troitzky's achievement is remarkable as he analysed the endgame single-handedly with no prior published theory or practice on which to build and of course no computer help. He identified the basic plan the techniques for corralling the defender's king and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be on each file in order for the position to be a win. A few later analysts tidied up some loose ends but almost all of the credit for solving this ending goes to Troitzky. The biggest compliment to the quality of his work came in 1995 when John Nunn published Secrets of Minor Piece Endings. This was part of a series of books in which Nunn updated and corrected established endgame theory for new discoveries thrown up by the early This ending is one of the most tech-generations of computer endgame tablebases. When it came to two knights versus pawn Nunn decided to omit this ending from his book ""after discovering that the pre-database work of Troitzky and other analysts was astonishingly accurate"". Effectively the tablebase added nothing of real significance to the earlier analysis!
The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously when he commences stage 3 he has to release the blockade on the pawn which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn): 
Despite Troitzky's analysis the end­ing is extremely complicated and far from easy to handle well even for top grandmasters. In practice when this ending arises it tends to be drawn rather more often than it is won. A few years after the present game for ex­ample the leading grandmaster Andor Lilienthal reached the endgame but was unable to win it (see Norman­Lilienthal Hastings 1934-5). He obviously did no"
157,6,1,6Kc4,b'8/8/2k2n2/5n2/2K2P2/8/8/8 b - -',"The main alternative defence was to flee towards the a8 corner with  66. Ka5 although the tablebase shows that this is actually the weakest defence and shortens the winning process by several moves. Black would con­tinue 66 ... Kc5 67. Ka6 Nd7! 68. Ka5 Nb6! 69. Ka6 Nc4! 70. Kb7 Kd6 etc.
The pattern shown over these last few moves is worth remembering as it is a very typical one for this ending. It oc­curs again much later in the present game but with the white king on the back rank-see moves 83-8S below."
158,6,2,6Ne4,b'8/8/2k5/5n2/2K1nP2/8/8/8 w - -',The knight on fs can never move until stage three is reached else White will just push his pawn (Black can never afford to capture it of course) so the job of corralling the white king has to be done by the black king and the other knight. 
159,6,3,Ne4+,b'8/8/8/2k2n2/4nP2/2K5/8/8 w - -',We can already see that white's king is gradually pushed back. One factor which makes this position slightly easier than some is that the blockading knight is quite centrally placed and thus helps to control some squares such as d4 and e3. With a rook's pawn the blockading knight is further from the centre and exerts less influence which complicates the job of driving the defender's king into the corner. 
160,6,4,Nf6,b'8/8/5n2/5n2/2k2P2/5K2/8/8 w - -',This is a good illustration of the last note. The two knights create an impenetrable barrier on the kingside preventing the white king from fleeing.
161,6,5,Ng4,b'8/8/8/5n2/5Pn1/2k5/8/3K4 w - -',This is one of Seitz's few inaccura­cies in this whole endgame. The table­base shows that 74 ... Kd3 would mate five moves more quickly but this is of little practical significance since Black has plenty of moves to spare in the 50 move allowance.
162,6,6,Nge3,b'8/8/8/5n2/5P2/2k1n3/4K3/8 w - -',This is an interesting formation. As a general rule of thumb two knights are less effectively placed when they defend each other and are more effective on adjacent squares creating a barrier such as seen at move 72. However here we see an exception -the two knights control g2 g3 g4 and h4 thus still con­fining the white king in the comer.
163,6,7,Nd5,b'8/8/8/3n1n2/5P2/3k4/5K2/8 w - -',Now the knight heads to c3 to cut the white king off from d1.

It is interesting that two of the best technical displays in this book (the present game and Torre-Jakobsen Game 16) should have come from players who did not even hold the grandmaster title.

My rationale was that the stonewall was strong but didn't offer me many chances at victory. There's a bit of a vacuum that might be exploited by Black with some solid moves although White generally controls the increasingly critical d5.

The queen is completely strangled and not well coordinated with her pieces and now White has effectively closed off any chances for Black to make a queenside advance.

White has decided to leave the g5 pawn en prise to establish control over much of Black's soft underbelly.

Worse still NONE of his pawns can move. To be fair none of White's can move either but his major pieces are positioned well to attack the f-file with a modified Alekhine's gun possible.
442,14,19,3Rh5,b'4k3/r2n2p1/1p1p2P1/pPpNp2r/P1P1P2p/3B3R/2Q3K1/2R5 w - -',Also a poor choice as opposed to a move to threaten the g6 pawn which White has no effective defense for. As long as the rook's going to get into the open why not open up a bunch more squares and get that pawn off the board?

What really condemned Black here was his dithering in the opening and White's aggressiveness taking the fight to the fifth rank and cramping the Black formation. From there Black's defeat just went down an inevitable road. White left the knight on d5 since move 19 the queen on c2 since move 14 and the bishop on d3 since move 5! They weren't needed - not enough to move them anyway - as Black really beat himself.

Ken gave me the fright of my life in my game against him as white and in that one Henry owes his life to Ken moving the wrong rook.  In this game Henry wasn't in such dire danger but despite being a pawn up Ken made my life difficult by putting pressure on my f7 pawn with his heavy pieces and it wasn't until he lost a second pawn that I was able to start moving my queenside pawns up the board and to distract Ken's heavy pieces from f7.

Ken does not want his queen to be taken and so resigns on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  A welcome win for yours truly but a great effort from Ken!

562,19,21,1Bd7,b'1qr2rk1/p2bppb1/1pnp1npp/8/Q2PP2N/7P/PP1NBPPB/R1R3K1 w - -',At first the possible discovery on the Queen is scary but in reality White has nothing to fear yet.

Nc4 planning to recapture on e5 with the knight is stronger here. The knight is well placed and it can open up possible discoveries on the Queen with Nxg6. The text is still not bad

Nxe2 but with the DSB locked in on g7 and the White rook controlling the c-file for the time being White shouldn't worry.

Kg3 Bh5 54. Kh4 wins the g-pawn. I had Kf2 in my sights but my calculations were all jittery and full of anxiety and I miscalculated the position of the Black Bishop

856,24,87,4f4,b'8/1k2N3/1p2b2p/1P2P1pP/2PK1p2/8/6P1/8 w - -',He opens up a diagonal to attack it!
857,24,88,4Ng6,b'8/1k6/1p2b1Np/1P2P1pP/2PK1p2/8/6P1/8 b - -',Now I have to manoeuvre my knight so I can pick up his h pawn
858,24,89,4Bg4,b'8/1k6/1p4Np/1P2P1pP/2PK1pb1/8/6P1/8 w - -',He goes after mine

864,24,95,4Be6,b'8/1k6/1p2b2N/1P2P1p1/2PK1p2/8/6P1/8 w - -',Now the bishop dominates my knight. I think I have missed by chance now I think this position is drawn.
865,24,96,4c5,b'8/1k6/1p2b2N/1PP1P1p1/3K1p2/8/6P1/8 b - -',My only chance

876,24,107,5Nd6+,b'4k3/8/3N1K2/4P3/8/8/b7/8 b - -',Draw agreed. Many thanks for reading this annotation. Please rate this annotation with the star system. Please leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on.
877,25,0,Nb8,b'1n6/4k2p/p3ppp1/1pPp4/3P1PP1/3NP3/P3K2P/8 w - -',This is a classic example of an extremely dynamic endgame. There is no time here for quiet manoeuvring or the gradual strengthening of the position. Black is threatening to bring his knight to c6 neutralizing White's protected  passed pawn when he would have nothing at all to fear. However in entering this position Pillsbury had calculated a truly wonderful finish which he had to see pretty much all the way to Black's resignation
878,25,1,2f5,b'1n6/4k2p/p3ppp1/1pPp1P2/3P2P1/3NP3/P3K2P/8 b - -',The key breakthrough. The threat is 28. Nf4 when Black will be unable to defend d5 so the reply is forced. 
879,25,2,2Nb4,b'1n6/4k2p/p3pp2/1pPp1Pp1/1N1P2P1/4P3/P3K2P/8 b - -',Now the knight jumps to the other side threatening the advance of the c­pawn. One move earlier this would have been ineffective because of the reply in the game but the changed central pawn structure makes all the difference.
880,25,3,2a5,b'1n6/4k2p/4pp2/ppPp1Pp1/1N1P2P1/4P3/P3K2P/8 w - -',Once again this is clearly forced.
881,25,4,2c6,b'1n6/4k2p/2P1pp2/pp1p1Pp1/1N1P2P1/4P3/P3K2P/8 b - -',This is the real point of White's play but he had to see a considerable distance to be able to play this.
882,25,5,Nxc6,b'8/7p/2nkPp2/pp1p2p1/1N1P2P1/4P3/P3K2P/8 w - -',Black is being led down a narrow path of only moves. If 30. ... axb4? then 31. e7 Kxe7 32. c7 wins.
883,25,6,Kxc6,b'8/7p/2k1Pp2/pp1p2p1/3P2P1/4P3/P3K2P/8 w - -',This is the first stage of White's grand conception but in order for it to work he had to realize that this pawn ending at first sight highly unfavourable is in fact winning. Black threatens to help himself to the e6-pawn when it is he who would be winning but White has another breakthrough.
884,25,7,3Ke3,b'8/7p/3kPp2/pp1P2p1/4p1P1/4K3/P6P/8 b - -',Now at last we begin to see the whole of Pillsbury's idea. His two central passed pawns are secure and his king can cope with the enemy pawns. It is a rare case of a king and pawn ending in which central passed pawns prove stronger than outside ones.
885,25,8,3b4,b'8/7p/3kPp2/p2P2p1/1p2p1P1/4K3/P6P/8 w - -',Black has to try to make something of his queen side pawns else White will simply take on e4 and then bring his king over to mop up the queen side.
886,25,9,h5,b'8/8/3kPp2/3P2pp/pp1K2P1/8/P6P/8 w - h6',Desperation but he is lost anyway. After the more natural 36. ... Ke7 play continues 37. Kc4 b3 38. axb3 a3 39. Kc3 f5 (the only remaining try setting up a passed pawn on the kingside but White's pawns are faster) 40. gxf5 h5 41. b4 g4 42. b5 h4 43.b6 g3 44 d6+! and White will queen first with check.
887,25,10,a3,b'8/8/3kPp2/3P2pP/1p1K4/p7/P6P/8 w - -',Threatening 38 ... b3.
888,25,11,4h7,b'8/7P/3kP3/3P2p1/1pK2p2/p7/P6P/8 b - -',"A justly famous ""white knuckle ride"" by Pillsbury who had to have calculated virtually the whole of the above sequence before entering the knight and pawn ending. Perish the thought that anyone should think that endings are boring but if there really is someone who does think so he should be converted by this example. "
889,26,0,4Kxd3,b'8/7p/p4p2/k1pP1Pp1/6P1/P2K4/8/8 b - -',"This is a particularly interesting position. Black has an extra pawn but since it is the backward pawn on h7 it does not look all that valuable as it seems unlikely to produce a passed pawn. Meanwhile the white king is quite active in the centre and he has a Pawn Endings passed pawn on d5 to set against Black's passed c5-pawn. However despite these first impressions the h­pawn in fact turns out to be vital after all. There are two reasons. One is that it provides a reserve tempo with ... h7-h6 which can play a vital role in a king dance for the opposition. Secondly there is also the potential tactical breakthrough ... h5 should the black king be located within the square of the resulting white passed pawn after the reply gxh5.
These factors prove sufficient to win the game for black but only thanks to some extremely nifty footwork by his king."
890,26,1,4Kb5,b'8/7p/p4p2/1kpP1Pp1/6P1/P2K4/8/8 w - -',"This is the only move to win since after 45 ... Kb6 46 Kc4 a5 47 a4   Black would be forced to expend his precious reserve tempo with 47 ... h6. 
As will be­come clear later the resulting position would only be a draw. "
891,26,2,a5,b'8/7p/1k3p2/p1pP1Pp1/P1K3P1/8/8/8 w - -',Now we have the same position as in the previous note but with White to move -a crucial difference.
892,26,3,4d6,b'8/7p/1k1P1p2/p1p2Pp1/P1K3P1/8/8/8 b - -',Keres shows that White has no al­ternative to this exchange of passed pawns since after 48. Kc3 Kc7 49. Kc4 Kd6 50. Kb5 Kxd5 51. Kxa5 ..  Black wins with the neat 51 ... Kc6! imprisoning the white king in front of his a-pawn.
893,26,4,5Kd5,b'8/4k2p/5p2/p2K1Pp1/P5P1/8/8/8 b - -',A vital moment. The move 51 Kb5 is is not possible because after 51 ... h5! 52 gxh5 g4 the g-pawn promoteswhilst the white h-pawn is stopped by Black's king (see the introductory remarks). This is the key point of the whole ending and shows that Black's extra h­-pawn is not the irrelevance it may have first seemed. The threat of ... h7-h5 means that the white king is effectively held in an invisible prison bounded by the square of the g5-pawn and cannot go left of the c-file or further forward than c5.
894,26,5,5Kf7,b'8/5k1p/5p2/p2K1Pp1/P5P1/8/8/8 w - -',Now 52 ... hs is again a threat this time with a quieter follow-up e.g. 52 Kd4 h5! 53 gxh5 Kg7! (with the idea of simply ... Kh6 and ... Kxh5) 54. Kd5 g4! 55. Ke4 Kh6 56. Kf4 Kxh5  winning easily.
895,26,6,Kf8,b'5k2/7p/5p2/p4Pp1/P3K1P1/8/8/8 w - -',Now 52. ... h5? 53. gxh5 Kg7 is not possible because of 54. Kf3 Kh6 55. Kg4 and the white king is in time to defend the hS-pawn. The point of the text is that White is in zugzwang. His king has to stay on the e-file to be able to meet the threat of 53. ... h5 54. gxh5 Kg7
896,26,7,5Ke3,b'5k2/7p/5p2/p4Pp1/P5P1/4K3/8/8 b - -',The only move but now we see that this too has its drawbacks.
897,26,8,5Ke7,b'8/4k2p/5p2/p4Pp1/P5P1/4K3/8/8 w - -',The black king changes direction and heads back to the centre. White must come to meet him and take the opposition but crucially Black still has his reserve tempo in his pocket. 
898,26,9,h6,b'8/8/3k1p1p/p4Pp1/P2K2P1/8/8/8 w - -',And here it is. Black takes the oppo­sition and the white king must give way. 
899,26,10,5Ke4,b'8/8/3k1p1p/p4Pp1/P3K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',Going the other way also loses once again because of the strike by the h­pawn: 56. Kc4 Ke5 57. Kb5 h5! Now the white king is out­side the square of the g5-pawn! 58. gxh5 Kxf5 59. Kxa5 g4 60. Kb5 g3 61. a5 g2 62. a6 g1 Queens and wins. 
900,26,11,Kd5,b'8/8/5p1p/p2k1Pp1/P5P1/4K3/8/8 w - -',"57 ... Kb4 also wins but allows unnecessary counter-play after 58. Kd4 Kxa4 59. Kd5 Kb3 60. Ke6 etc.
Keres' move maintains Black's dominance and wins without any alarums."
901,26,12,h5,b'8/8/5p2/p3kPpp/P5P1/4K3/8/8 w - -',Fittingly enough it is the h-pawn which administers the coup de grace. 
902,26,13,Ke6,b'8/8/4kp2/p5pP/P7/5K2/8/8 w - -',As Keres points out this is again simpler than 61 ... g4+ 62. Kg3 Kg5 63. h6  although Black is still winning after 63 ..Kxh6 64. Kxg4 Kg6 65. Kf4 f5 
903,26,14,Kg7,b'8/6k1/5p2/p4KpP/P7/8/8/8 w - -',A highly instructive endgame showing several important themes.
904,27,0,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez but black's move here is an inaccuracy allowing d4! and white has a push.
905,27,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',This is often what I will do when I'm playing white. Not always however; it's not the best way to maintain tension and create a complicated position wherein one can find beautiful continuations.
906,27,2,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Castling here for white is now possible but I prefer to create a long time problem for black.
907,27,3,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The best move. Ne7 here is rather passive.
908,27,4,Bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/1B6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',bxc6 would have been better gaining black a useful tempo.
909,27,5,bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/p1p2ppp/2pp4/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',And so I have created three pawn islands for black while I have only two; in addition he has doubled pawns. This is definitely advantage white. Now it's a race to develop properly and take advantage of that which.... admittedly I fail to do! ;)
910,27,6,O-O,b'r2qkbnr/p1p2ppp/2pp4/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White's advantage according to Fritz is more than a pawn!
911,27,7,Kh1,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1R1K b kq -',The pawn is immune in this position due to the knight pin that would result. So I take the time to get my king off the black bishop's dark squares. So far so good. An immediate Re1 might have been better here.
912,27,8,Be7,b'r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1R1K w kq -',Preparing to castle and threatening now white's e pawn for real.
913,27,9,1f3,b'r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1R1K b kq -',Better was a developing move as noted in another annotated game by elyhim.
914,27,10,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1R1K w - -',The game is mostly equal but I like white better.
915,27,11,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/4BP2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1R1K b - -',Fritz wanted me to move the knight to d2. I didn't like that idea here.
916,27,12,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1R1K w - -',This move caught me off guard but in retrospect I should have realized black would immediately try to wrest the initiative from me and put his odd pawns to work in order to remove their liability. In addition it is restricting my white bishop; so a very useful move at this point.
917,27,13,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',The previous black move also caused me to move my knight very passively. Had I put the knight on c3 I thought black would immediately force pawn trades in the middle which I felt I was not ready for.
918,27,14,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2pp1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Preparing d5 but it's not quite ready.
919,27,15,1Rb1,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2pp1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',Simply getting my rook off that dangerous diagonal and protecting the b pawn. Very passive and black takes advantage of this.
920,27,16,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',Alas for black he needed to prepare first to prevent white's reply...
921,27,17,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2ppP3/8/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',And now the position is getting a bit difficult for white because if I am not careful those pawns could roll a ways. I've let them start to dominate! Not good. But I'm not quite ready to maneuver to attack.
922,27,18,1d4,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p1P3/3p4/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',This is a blunder one I did not catch while we played. It gives white a piece for the pawn. But I didn't see it playing too quickly in this Blitz game I retreated the Bishop.
923,27,19,1Bf2,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p1P3/3p4/5P2/PPPN1BPP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',So by not seeing this properly I've now made a blunder throwing away all white advantage.
924,27,20,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p5/2pnP3/3p4/5P2/PPPN1BPP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',That knight is very well placed for the time being.
925,27,21,1Nc4,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p5/2pnP3/2Np4/5P2/PPP2BPP/1R1Q1R1K b - -',I respond with this move primarily to put a stop to further black pawn advances; however black has made better progress than he should have and as a result has an advantage.
926,27,22,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/2p5/2pnP1b1/2Np4/5P2/PPP2BPP/1R1Q1R1K w - -',Further controlling the dark squares although Fritz likes ...Nb6 better and considers this an inaccuracy.
927,27,23,1g3,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/2p5/2pnP1b1/2Np4/5PP1/PPP2B1P/1R1Q1R1K b - -',So I open up my King trying for more counter play than simply trading pawns. Fritz dislikes this move and in general I'd agree...
928,27,24,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/p4ppp/2p5/2pnP1b1/2Np4/5PP1/PPP2B1P/1R1Q1R1K w - -',A lot of inaccuracies in this part of the game by us both! Nb6 or f6 were both better ways for black to have better activity.
929,27,25,1f4,b'r2qr1k1/p4ppp/2p5/2pnP1b1/2Np1P2/6P1/PPP2B1P/1R1Q1R1K b - -',Fortunately for me at this point in the game the black king wants to keep that f7 pawn on f7; in order now to protect my king I will need to control a lot of spaces which... will put me on the defensive a long while.
930,27,26,1Bh6,b'r2qr1k1/p4ppp/2p4b/2pnP3/2Np1P2/6P1/PPP2B1P/1R1Q1R1K w - -',I think this is a positional error unless black makes a way to get his bishop back into the action. Fritz calls this move a blunder; and indeed it traps the bishop unless the black king's protection is intentionally fragmented.
931,27,27,1Qf3,b'r2qr1k1/p4ppp/2p4b/2pnP3/2Np1P2/5QP1/PPP2B1P/1R3R1K b - -',It will be critical to control this diagonal for some time. Fritz agrees.
932,27,28,1f6,b'r2qr1k1/p5pp/2p2p1b/2pnP3/2Np1P2/5QP1/PPP2B1P/1R3R1K w - -',To my surprise black decides to open up his king in such a way that his defensive liability could become as bad as white's. I had no active plans yet to force that pawn to open up black's kingside but my thought was along those lines after consolidating and coordinating my pieces some I was then going to find a plan to do that. I don't like this move by black.
933,27,29,2c3,b'r2qr1k1/p5pp/2p2p1b/2pnP3/2Np1P2/2P2QP1/PP3B1P/1R3R1K b - -',I decide to deal with all those center pawns while I can as it makes sense to open the position more with a more vulnerable black king.
934,27,30,2bxc3,b'r2qr1k1/p5pp/2p2p1b/2pnP3/2N2P2/2P2QP1/P4B1P/1R3R1K b - -',White still holds the advantage; the game no longer looks so bad for white.
935,27,31,2Nxe5,b'r2qr1k1/p5pp/2p4b/2pnN3/5P2/2P2QP1/P4B1P/1R3R1K b - -',This moves my knight to a wonderful outpost; it also threatens both c file pawns and prevents black moving c4 as a result for the moment. After some thought black chose to give up whichever pawn I chose hoping a small trick would work.
936,27,32,2Qf6,b'r3r1k1/p5pp/2p2q1b/2pnN3/5P2/2P2QP1/P4B1P/1R3R1K w - -',He tries his trick which of course is noticed. Rxe5 is threatened.
937,27,33,2Bxc5,b'r3r1k1/p5pp/2p2q1b/2BnN3/5P2/2P2QP1/P6P/1R3R1K b - -',The best move.  Unwise of black to allow occupation of the d4 square.

The black c pawn is hanging were I to choose to grab it. Meanwhile I maneuver to try to regain the initiative.
943,27,39,2Rf2,b'r3r1k1/6pp/2p4b/p2nN3/P2B1P2/2P2QPq/5R1P/1R5K b - -',Fritz says this is an inaccuracy but I felt it was necessary at this point.
944,27,40,2Rad8,b'3rr1k1/6pp/2p4b/p2nN3/P2B1P2/2P2QPq/5R1P/1R5K w - -',I can only surmise my opponent here forgot about his hanging pawn. I haven't. I've just been too busy to grab it. Rac8 protecting that pawn would have been good.

Since I now have g2 to escape too I now have a choice: grab the pawn now or move Ne7 forcing an exchange with black's bishop. Yet I cannot foresee in the game if this will be more fruitful than grabbing that pawn so I... grab the pawn. OOoo brave soul that I am... errr umm... ...Fritz agrees! Sometimes a pawn grab is a good thing.

948,27,44,2Ne5,b'2r1r1k1/1R4pp/7b/p2nNq2/P2B1P2/2P2QP1/5R1P/7K b - -',I am feeling a lot better about things despite allowing black some room. I believe I am controlling the center better than black despite appearances; black's pieces are not coordinated well he is obstructed and his bishop has been out of the action for a while.
949,27,45,2Nc7,b'2r1r1k1/1Rn3pp/7b/p3Nq2/P2B1P2/2P2QP1/5R1P/7K w - -',Because I did get away with a couple of pawns... I now can hold a winning endgame advantage with care. Black decides to move the knight rather than protect it since he wishes to rid me of my bishop now is the time for him to try. Right here according to Fritz I am nearly 6 points up although only two pawns up material-wise.
950,27,46,3Kg2,b'2r1r1k1/1Rn3pp/7b/p3Nq2/P2B1P2/2P2QP1/5RKP/8 b - -',Immediately I grab the g2 square so I can get to h3 if necessary. Fritz liked g4 but I was not willing to chance further loosening of my king position.

955,27,51,3Nxd4,b'2r1r1k1/5Rpp/7b/p3N2Q/P2n1P2/2P3P1/5RKP/1q6 w - -',Black removes some of the pressure but... it also removes an  important defender...

958,27,54,3Rf3,b'2r1r1k1/5Rpp/7b/p3N2Q/P2q1P2/5RPK/7P/8 b - -',The power of the e5 knight for both threatening black and controlling important squares has been growing for some time. With black's bishop STILL doing nothing black now is essentially playing a man down. Here in this position black is really tied down to defending his king. White's advantage may not yet be enough to win without an oversight by black... and...
959,27,55,3Rc2,b'4r1k1/5Rpp/7b/p3N2Q/P2q1P2/5RPK/2r4P/8 w - -',...there it is. Rc2?? The winning white move here is easy to spot for those of you lower rated take a little time and try to spot it.

I have another game to annotate.  This time it is a player who had a Class D rating but after putting himself under the wing of Cyrano the Great Overall Mentor of Group D he has come on in leaps and bounds.  His name is Jellycake (John).  In this game he gave me a run for my money and material was even until the endgame when he left a pawn en prise.  That was the only material he left en prise.  The rest of his game was absolutely solid.  Alas for John that one little pawn proved decisive and he ended up sacrificing his rook to prevent Glenda from making an appearance.  However K & R v Bare King was just the minimum amount of material I needed to force checkmate.  After careful analysis I was able to demonstrate to John how this checkmate could be brought about.  John then resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  So how did this come about?  Well read on ........"

PxP. but 7 N-Q2 is probably a strong way to meet this threat. (JC) This method of defense often leaves Black with 2 B's against B and N which in a general way constitutes an advantage.

1164,36,7,f6,b'r4rk1/pbq3pp/1pp2p2/2bPp3/2P1P3/P2B1N2/1QR2PPP/R5K1 w - -',(JC) Black's play hereabout is weak; it lacks force and there seems to be no well-defined plan of attack. It is true that these are the most difficult positions to handle in a game. In such cases a player must conceive a plan on a large scale which promises chances of success and with it all it must be a plan that can be carried out with the means at his disposal. From the look of the position it seems that Black's best chance would be to mass his forces for an attack against White's center to be followed by a direct attack against the King. He should therefore play ... QR-K1 threatening ... P-KB4. If White is able to prevent this plan then once Black has fixed some of the White pieces on the K side he should quickly shift his attack to the Q side and open a line for his Rooks which once they enter into action should produce an advantage on account of the great power of the two Bishops.

If he retook with the BP I intended to exchange Bishops and rely on the 2 pawns to 1 on the Q-side. I did not expect him to retake with the KP which seemed to expose him to a violent K-side attack. (JC) Black's judgment in this instance I believe to be faulty. Had White retaken with the BP as Black expected Black would have had the worst of the Pawn position as White would have had a passed Pawn well supported on the Q-side. Black's only advantage would lie in having a very well posted Bishop against a badly posted Knight. If Black had played 26... B-B1 he could have replied to 27 Q-N3 with 27... PxP preventing 28 BPxP? on account of 28... BxP ch winning the Exchange.

1211,38,5,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/N2pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',If I was living in the past before I was this good I would not know why black moved here.  But from experience and a video by GM Susan Polgar where she was actually teaching chess students I figured out that this is a developing move.  And this position Tom is doing an excellent job in controlling the center since this move opens a line for his DSB.
1212,38,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/N2pP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Recognizing one problem associated with 2.Nc3 I decide to do some although not complete correction with this move.  Now although I am threatening to win a pawn that's not my main intention.  But that will happen later on.  My main intention in this position is to put pressure on the e file with this move so that Tom feels pressured.   Sooner or later we will see how this unfolds.  So although not immediately I accomplished my goal and then some.
1213,38,7,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/8/1p2p3/N2pP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq b6',? In the meantime he decides to attack my N on the rim.
1214,38,8,Bxb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/8/1B2p3/N2pP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',But that does not bother me because I take it with this check.  What white did not realize or might have forgotten is that his LSB is not on the d file.  So I don't lose anything with this move.  Instead I wind up with a pawn ahead.  And despite losing when the game is over Tom will mention to Jack and I that winning this pawn is just one of the many things that makes this game extremely good.
1215,38,9,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p5/1B2p3/N2pP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Not surprisingly however is the fact that he gets out of this by attacking my B.  This is the kind of thing that I expect from higher rated opponents.  I think however that this is where I got bad habits of attacking material for the thrill it.  That's because it's the kind of thing that I see GM's do so although Jack likes when I study things that GM's analyze it's important for me to be aware as a couple of coaches told me that I should not try some of the really fancy stuff that Masters Grandmasters do immediately.  First I should focus on becoming even stronger and then I can start studying it.  It's just like when I had to figure out my main weakness and needed a lot of coaching before I could start coaching and mentoring myself.
1216,38,10,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p5/4p3/N1BpP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So this is where I retreat eyeing f7.  And no I am not attempting a mate in one as you might think.  Instead I am just trying to find a good outpost for my LSB.  That's because my only other move was 6.Bd3.  However this move is best because retreating to the d file will later on force me to waste tempii if I want to control the center.  Sooner or later my plan is to advance my other center pawn and open up lines.  This will allow me to get another piece out contest the center and complete development so that when everything is developed I can get my Q out.  Blocking the d file will prevent two of the things that I just outlined.
1217,38,11,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2pb4/4p3/N1BpP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move however is ok and does not contest the center because of where his d pawn is positioned.  That's because he was able to advance it two squares as opposed to one.  Having said that this is why 2.Nc3? was a mistake.  Best was to simply follow the main line and exchange.
1218,38,12,O-O,b'rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2pb4/4p3/N1BpP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',In the meantime however I was still going to castle one way or another.
1219,38,13,Ba6,b'rn1qk1nr/p4ppp/b1pb4/4p3/N1BpP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I understand that Tom wanted to continue with development which is why he moved his LSB.  However I do not know why he wants to exchange instead of play something like ...Bb7 or ...Be6.  In fact if I were black I would not dare to trade bishops because I am behind.  Now with this move I will take advantage of him by capturing.  Since I'm ahead even exchanges will benefit my position and I will not hesitate to take advantage of my opportunities.
1220,38,14,d3,b'r2qk1nr/p4ppp/n1pb4/4p3/N2pP3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',As mentioned earlier my d pawn can only advance one square since black already played ...d4.  
1221,38,15,Ne7,b'r2qk2r/p3nppp/n1pb4/4p3/N2pP3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Meanwhile black is going to continue with his development.
1222,38,16,1Nh4,b'r2qk2r/p3nppp/n1pb4/4p3/N2pP2N/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',While I was a little spacey I think I went a little too far with this move.  I was kind of focused on a cheapo tactic which I never should have been.  But I was also focused on something which was more likely to and actually did occur.  Like usual I got a little hyperfocused on winning his g pawn.  And I kind of was not paying attention to the fact that he can do something but there's more to this then meets the eye.  In other words there was a little more to getting somewhat spacey and not paying complete attention which I will explain towards the end and it says a lot about this title.  But on the other hand I kept in mind that if I couldn't win a pawn I would be able to exchange his DSB for my N.  The reason being is that I'm still ahead so even if he were to defend I would have absolutely nothing to lose with this move.  In fact it would give me another advantage. 
1223,38,17,1Ng6,b'r2qk2r/p4ppp/n1pb2n1/4p3/N2pP2N/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! So he responds by attacking my N that's on the rim.
1224,38,18,1Nf5,b'r2qk2r/p4ppp/n1pb2n1/4pN2/N2pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',"But I am not bothered by that.  Instead I feel like he just wasted time because I decide to attack his g pawn.  But as thereaper1 asked me in a couple of previous annotations did you think that your opponent would allow you to take.  At the time I would have said no but I assumed that black has messed up in some way and henceforth had no way around which would mean that the threat would not be so easy to spot.  However I missed just one thing that my opponent could do about this.  Normally I don't make moves like this but believe it or not in OTB this kind of thing used to be a little more common the internet chess.  But as noted earlier I am not completely with it.  So although I'm not sleepy I kind of have to ""wake up and smell the coffee"" as they say."
1225,38,19,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/n1pb2n1/4pN2/N2pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Unlike in a previous game while my opponent cannot attack my N in this position my move was somewhat pointless as he now protects by castling.  Still this reaction means that there's not as much to get upset about with my last move.  Having your opponent defend by castling does not put you at a real disadvantage if you're already castled.  When he counter attacks then it's a different story and you've got problems.  However this time black will have something else to think about now that he has kept his g7 pawn.  I will exchange his DSB for my f5 N.  Not only am I ahead but I'm getting rid of his strong bishop.  And with that in mind I am beginning to get more and more confident as time goes on.  But of course I am not going to underestimate him.
1226,38,20,1Bd2,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/n1pq2n1/4p3/N2pP3/3P4/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now that all is said and done I take advantage of the opportunity to get my last minor piece out.  Of course black now has a slight lead in development given that he is completed developed.  But once my Q out then we'll be equal again.  
1227,38,21,1Nc7,b'r4rk1/p1n2ppp/2pq2n1/4p3/N2pP3/3P4/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',In this position Tom moved here to take his N back on the homepage.
1228,38,22,1c3,b'r4rk1/p1n2ppp/2pq2n1/4p3/N2pP3/2PP4/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"?! At this point Tom takes a mini break and my coach said ""Your Knight is misplaced.  Be careful it is in danger.""  This is the first time where I have mixed feelings about it.  In other words I agree but also disagree with Jack at the same time.  It's not in immediate but should he ever enable himself to play ...Qa6 it will be.  First I looked to see if anything was in immediate danger before fussing over the N.  When I determined that it wasn't then I would come up with a plan to defend my piece.  Normally I don't make a big deal about stuff like this but as we all know it's important to think steps ahead and not just move by move.  This is a perfect example.  Before I realized that there were other places for my N I told my coach that I had to place my N on the rim to defend it and that there was no way around it.  Now that I think about it however there were other options that I did not see.  Of course when I played Na4 I actually felt like I was in a different time zone but only at that moment.  And that's pretty bizarre because I did not feel this way in my game against Jack.  But it was as though I flew from the West Coast right to the East coast.  And there is a 3 hour time difference from opposite coasts.  So even though the game started at like 11:00 am it temporarly felt like 8:00 a.m. in my body.  Now that I'm in a later phase I'm beginning to get back to normal and am starting to feel like my normal self again.  However things will not be completely normal until the end.  Mr. Stockel said that I had a very good move that I could make which would protect my N.  But he wasn't going to tell me the move since I was in a middle of a game against Tom.  Although it's OTB and not rated having a different person tell you the right move even your coach is like cheating.  Of course I found the move and this is it.  Because I am counting and relying on an exchange. After which his d pawn will not hang in this spot and so my N will be perfectly safe on the c file.  Of course that is exchange is not going to happen so this move is not going to help.  So I will have to come up with a different plan.  "
1229,38,23,1c5,b'r4rk1/p1n2ppp/3q2n1/2p1p3/N2pP3/2PP4/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',After this move I don't exchange because after Tom retakes he'll still have a pawn on d4 which will prevent me from bringing my N on c3.  In fact even if he hadn't played ...c5 that would have happened which is why 14.c3?! was pointless.
1230,38,24,1c4,b'r4rk1/p1n2ppp/3q2n1/2p1p3/N1PpP3/3P4/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I instead decide to play this.  Why?  Because in these types of positions I have see games where strong players advance their pawns one square like this as opposed to making a capture.  And this kind of thing has given them an advantage.
1231,38,25,1Ne6,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/3qn1n1/2p1p3/N1PpP3/3P4/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This time I don't know why black played this.
1232,38,26,1b3,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/3qn1n1/2p1p3/N1PpP3/1P1P4/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But at least I finally found the right move to bring my N safely back on the homepage.  I will however wait until later because this move accomplishes something else which is that my N is now protected.  And that was also one of my goals since Jack told me that my Knight was in danger.
1233,38,27,1Ngf4,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/3qn3/2p1p3/N1PpPn2/1P1P4/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',In this position black attempts to win back a pawn.  But I am not going to allow him to take on d3.
1234,38,28,1Qf3,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/3qn3/2p1p3/N1PpPn2/1P1P1Q2/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And because of that I am also now completely developed.  So I just gained back an advantage that I didn't have.  In addition this is one reason why I decided to hold off on putting my N back to the homepage.  Since it's not in danger or anything else like that perhaps the only principle which I generally ignore is that a N on the rim is grim.  Although some GM's like Susan Polgar tell you that developing in the wrong spot can be worse then not developing.  And she does take her N off the homepage as an example I don't see where it makes much of a difference unless my piece is in immediate danger.  However if I were still a beginner then it absolutely would matter as I would try to just stick with all the basics.  Over time you learn that one does not have to make a big deal about everything regarding General Openings.  Otherwise that's the equivalent to hyperfocusing.
1235,38,29,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/3qn3/2p1p3/N1PpPn2/1P1P1Q2/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is where I start forgetting which rook was moved.  But this move makes a lot more sense to me.  So he brings his rook over which you generally see after being completely developed.  This however makes much more sense Rfc8.  The reason being is that when both your Rooks are connected like this it's not a good idea to bring your rook on the same color as the other rook as I have learned from Mr. Stockel.
1236,38,30,1Rae1,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/3qn3/2p1p3/N1PpPn2/1P1P1Q2/P2B1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Having said all of that I also bring rook my over but on a different color as well.
1237,38,31,1Ng5,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/3q4/2p1p1n1/N1PpPn2/1P1P1Q2/P2B1PPP/4RRK1 w - -',?! So black decides to attack my Q.  I don't know why because I feel that it doesn't accomplish anything
1238,38,32,1Qg4,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/3q4/2p1p1n1/N1PpPnQ1/1P1P4/P2B1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Therefore like my game against Jack I decide to counterattack in order to punish black for his attack.
1239,38,33,1Qf6,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/5q2/2p1p1n1/N1PpPnQ1/1P1P4/P2B1PPP/4RRK1 w - -',I thought that my last move was enough to intimidate black so that he would retreat.  However I missed something important.  As it turns out Tom can and does defend his N with this move instead so that he has nothing to worry about.  However since I'm still ahead this move does not stop me from exchanging his N for my B.  The only problem that I didn't realize is that the exchange involves my dominant.  Now at the time I had trouble determining a strong from a weak bishop.  But as it turns out this was my dominant bishop.
1240,38,34,Qxf4,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/8/2p1p1n1/N1PpPqQ1/1P1P4/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Not surprisingly he takes back with the Q as opposed to his e pawn.  And this is a better move.  However I will force another exchange as opposed to retreating my Q.
1241,38,35,2Nb2,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/8/2p3n1/2PpPp2/1P1P4/PN3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Since all is said and done now I bring my N back to its homepage since I'm ready to do so.  This implies that there was absolutely no rush because what I outlined earlier. 
1242,38,36,2Ne6,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/4n3/2p5/2PpPp2/1P1P4/PN3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',In this position I think that Tom is a little too worried about his a pawn.  I mean he will protect soon but it's not in danger.  But I understand that he thinks it will be in danger in several moves but why?  Although I am ahead I'm not threatening to take it anytime soon.
1243,38,37,2f3,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/4n3/2p5/2PpPp2/1P1P1P2/PN4PP/4RRK1 b - -',So I decide to advance another pawn.  Now that we're near an endgame there's no danger in putting a whole around the K because pretty soon my King will become a powerful weapon.
1244,38,38,2Nc7,b'2r2rk1/p1n2ppp/8/2p5/2PpPp2/1P1P1P2/PN4PP/4RRK1 w - -',?! He protects afterall but as noted a move earlier it's not anywhere in danger.  So that's why I view and marked this move as pointless.  It's simply because I don't believe that this is pointless and does not accomplish anything.
1245,38,39,2a3,b'2r2rk1/p1n2ppp/8/2p5/2PpPp2/PP1P1P2/1N4PP/4RRK1 b - -',?? At this point I am trying to figure out a way to get a passed pawn.  But after the game Tom told me that he thinks this move is the losing blunder and my decisive mistake which is why I marked with two question marks.  One reason is that he will now win back a pawn after ...Rb8.  Now of course I'm not crazy about 24.a4 in this position due to tactical reasons.  But what I found out was that a4 actually would have been a lot worse then I thought.  In fact that move would  have lost very quickly.  This move however does not seal my fate as quickly but luck will run out when we reach the endgame.  That's because of what he's going to do in the next few moves.  Pretty soon his N will swarm in on the a file and it will lead to a loss of material.  Therefore I will wind up behind as opposed to ahead believe it or not.
1246,38,40,2a5,b'2r2rk1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/2PpPp2/PP1P1P2/1N4PP/4RRK1 w - a6',! At this point black decides to advance.  At first did not know what it this would accomplish because I didn't think that it could promote.  But I will find out otherwise later on.   
1247,38,41,2a4,b'2r2rk1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1P1P1P2/1N4PP/4RRK1 b - -',At this point I am just trying to stop him from getting a passed pawn.  But come to think of it it's too little too late because that by definition is a passed pawn as we will see shortly.
1248,38,42,2Rcb8,b'1r3rk1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1P1P1P2/1N4PP/4RRK1 w - -',! This move automatically wins back a pawn as noted earlier.
1249,38,43,2Nd1,b'1r3rk1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1P1P1P2/6PP/3NRRK1 b - -',Without any way to defend b3 I decide to move my N knowing that it will be in danger right after he takes.  
1250,38,44,2Nf2,b'5rk1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1r1P1P2/5NPP/4RRK1 b - -',But I want to keep it on a square where development is complete.  In other words had it been left on d2 that would undo some of my development which I don't want.
1251,38,45,2Rfb8,b'1r4k1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1r1P1P2/5NPP/4RRK1 w - -',This is a very common and dangerous move.  At this point black decided to double his Rooks like this.  We usually see strong players do that and in the past Jack Stockel taught me that this is generally a good idea to do this because doubled rooks can pose as immediate threats.  For example a long time ago Jack Stockel defeated despite the fact that I was a Q ahead he managed to deliver mate with doubled rooks similar to this.
1252,38,46,2g3,b'1r4k1/2n2ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1r1P1PP1/5N1P/4RRK1 b - -',Since material is even I still see no harm in trying to force an exchange.
1253,38,47,2Ne6,b'1r4k1/5ppp/4n3/p1p5/P1PpPp2/1r1P1PP1/5N1P/4RRK1 w - -',?! At first I wasn't sure why he played this but a second look shows he actually wants to win a free pawn.  And it appears that once he plays ...Ng5 that will be feasible.  But I am not going to allow so this move was pointless.  Instead I am going to exchange in order to avoid losing material.
1254,38,48,3Red1,b'1r4k1/5ppp/8/p1p5/P1PpPn2/1r1P1P2/5N1P/3R1RK1 b - -',Recognizing that my d pawn is in danger this is the very move that protects it.  In other words any other move loses my P.
1255,38,49,3f6,b'1r4k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/1r1P1P2/5N1P/3R1RK1 w - -',Since this is an endgame it's now appropriate to activate the King.  That's because in an endgame the K becomes a powerful the equivalent to at least a piece from what I've heard.
1256,38,50,3Rd2,b'1r4k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/1r1P1P2/3R1N1P/5RK1 b - -',I miscalculated.  In this position I thought that my d pawn was in danger.  That's because I thought that I sensed a fork after 31...Ne2+ but as it turns out that check would not be anything to worry about.
1257,38,51,3Rb8b4,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/PrPpPn2/1r1P1P2/3R1N1P/5RK1 w - -',At this point however black makes a go for it.  Now I don't if Tom played this or R3b4 but I think that he moved his rook on the eighth because I seem to recall the R's being bundled up like this (right on top of one another).  Either way however it doesn't matter because the result is still the same and in the exact same way.  My a R is now attacked so there is something to think about this time.
1258,38,52,3Ra1,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/PrPpPn2/1r1P1P2/3R1N1P/R5K1 b - -',Therefore I have to protect a4.
1259,38,53,3Rb3b1+,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/PrPpPn2/3P1P2/3R1N1P/Rr4K1 w - -',So he decides to place me in check at all.  But this time I realize that it's not serious so I am bothered by it as I will force an exchange.
1260,38,54,Rxb1+,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/3P1P2/3R1N1P/1r4K1 w - -',And I also don't mind being check any more now then I did earlier.  
1261,38,55,3Nd1,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/3P1P2/3R3P/1r1N2K1 b - -',I also could have gotten out of this with 24.Rd1 and exchanged with 24...Rxd1 25.Nxd1.  But for some reason I like this move better.  Either way it does not prevent white from losing a pawn.  Therefore I will actually end up a pawn behind because after the exchange black would have been able to take ...Nxd3.  As Tom later told me when I talking about the losing move either way a pawn is gone in this position.
1262,38,56,3Ra1,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/3P1P2/3R3P/r2N2K1 w - -',The reason why I can't protect a4 is that I cannot play 35.Nb2 because my N is directly pinned to the K.  In addition I cannot defend with 35.Ra2?? or I'll lose material worth much more in this position.
1263,38,57,3Kf2,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/P1PpPn2/3P1P2/3R1K1P/r2N4 b - -',Without any way to defend my pawn I decide to activate my K in an attempt to use it as a weapon.  In addition this gets rid of my absolute pin.
1264,38,58,3Nb2,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/r1PpPn2/3P1P2/1N1R1K1P/8 b - -',Because of his last move without much to lose I decide to intimidate black with this move.  And I was thinking in terms of trying to pull a swindle given that I'm now a pawn behind.  However this plan is not going to work.
1265,38,59,3Rb4,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/1rPpPn2/3P1P2/1N1R1K1P/8 w - -',!! At first I wasn't sure why he moved there and actually viewed this move as ?!.  That's because there's no point in trying to attack a piece knowing that you can't win it.  However this is way more this then meets the eye and Tom wouldn't make a move just attack like this unless he knew that it would win something.  Although black extremely well this was by far his best move.  As we will see later on this move will threaten a pawn promotion and ultimately lead to my downfall.  And that's why this move is extraordinarily brilliant.
1266,38,60,3Kg3,b'6k1/6pp/5p2/p1p5/1rPpPn2/3P1PK1/1N1R3P/8 b - -',Knowing that he can't take I moved here but more then to simply attack his N.  It's because now I'm starting to execute my plans of using my K as a weapon.
1267,38,61,3g5,b'6k1/7p/5p2/p1p3p1/1rPpPn2/3P1PK1/1N1R3P/8 w - g6',At the same time however black realizes that his N is attacked so he takes action with this move.
1268,38,62,3h4,b'6k1/7p/5p2/p1p3p1/1rPpPn1P/3P1PK1/1N1R4/8 b - h3',At this point I want to force an exchange.  Normally it's a bad idea to exchange when you're behind so why do it at all?  Well if 38...gxh4 I can make my K more powerful by retaking with 39.Kxh4 and that was the part of the same plan that I had noted earlier.  However black is not going to allow that.
1269,38,63,3h6,b'6k1/8/5p1p/p1p3p1/1rPpPn1P/3P1PK1/1N1R4/8 w - -',Instead he counteracts with this move making 38.h4.
1270,38,64,3Kg4,b'6k1/8/5p1p/p1p3p1/1rPpPnKP/3P1P2/1N1R4/8 b - -',However I am still going to be bring my K out.  And now I originally felt that I had an advantage due to the opposition.  But that is not the case here.
1271,38,65,3Kf7,b'8/5k2/5p1p/p1p3p1/1rPpPnKP/3P1P2/1N1R4/8 w - -',Instead black gets out of it by activating his K.
1272,38,66,4Rh2,b'8/5k2/5p1p/p1p3p1/1rPpPnKP/3P1P2/1N5R/8 b - -',Although there's not much to worry aside from the fact that he's ahead I decide to give my h4 pawn extra protection with this move.  While it was not in danger a few months ago Jack Stockel told me to count your number of pieces and pawns and compare them to the amount that your opponent has.  This is what he means by that.  For example up until a move earlier none of us would have lost anything if he played something like ...gxh5.  That's because we both have a pawn to make the recapture.  But now I have an extra piece to take back so if he decided to play that I would simply respond with Rxh4 and this would actually win two pawns as opposed to one so I would instead be the same as I was before (a pawn ahead).
1273,38,67,4Kg6,b'8/8/5pkp/p1p3p1/1rPpPnKP/3P1P2/1N5R/8 w - -',Of course my opponent is not going to retake.  Instead he plays this to achieve the opposition like I attempted to do before.
1274,38,68,4Kg3,b'8/8/5pkp/p1p3p1/1rPpPn1P/3P1PK1/1N5R/8 b - -',With his last move this is forced anything else would allow black to mate in one with ...h5#.
1275,38,69,4a4,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpPn1P/3P1PK1/1N5R/8 w - -',Like we saw earlier in the game this is the same pawn that he is trying to promote with.  The only problem is that his R is there making it very difficult to prevent his promotion.  That's because black is preventing me from taking his pawn which is what made 36...Rb4!! extraordinarily brilliant.
1276,38,70,4Nd1,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpPn1P/3P1PK1/7R/3N4 b - -',Because I now know how close he is to promoting I try to prevent that with this move as it does prevent him from playing ...a2.  However this is only the beginning of white's problem as we are about to find out.
1277,38,71,4Nxd3,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpP2P/3n1PK1/7R/3N4 w - -',First he wins another free pawn putting me further behind.  And things are about to take an ugly turn.
1278,38,72,4Rd2,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpP2P/3n1PK1/3R4/3N4 b - -',"After taking I now decide to resort to extreme aggression and the reason being is that I now realize that I'm losing.  So now I decide to attack his N just for the thrill of it.  I won't do this kind of thing unless I am well aware that I'm clearly losing as in this case.  When you're in trouble like this there is nothing to lose by becoming super aggressive.  As black-cat-hamelet commented in a previous annotation ""The only time playing badly would ever be of any use is if you are losing anyway and try a strategy you know can fail in the hope that your opponent falls for the trap.""  This is a perfect example.  Who knows?  Not in this game but sometimes getting this aggressive in a desperate situation can help you to pull a swindle as I have done before.  For me at least it shows that I'm not afraid or ready to resign.  It's pretty much contradictory of when I was a beginner and resigned prematurely.  Well I learned from that  so I don't do it anymore.  But this is one of the main that turned that weakness into a strength believe it or not (the ability to pull swindles).  And this is pretty much why Jack Stockel says ""Don't give up right away."""
1279,38,73,4Nf4,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpPn1P/5PK1/3R4/3N4 w - -',As expected he retreats.  So even if can't be aggression I have to come up with a different fi I have any hope of staying in the game.
1280,38,74,4Ra2,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/prPpPn1P/5PK1/R7/3N4 b - -',And this is the plan.  I figured that at the very least black would lose some of his winning advantage.  In one respect I thought that I just outsmarted him and diffused the situation with this move but that is not the case.  Sure it prevents him from promoting which is what he wanted.  But he is now going to win another pawn and there is no way around it.  I missed that but even if I hadn't I certainly would have moved here anyway due to extenuating circumstances that I just mentioned.  If I didn't he would certainly promote and I didn't want to allow it.  However this position is hopeless for white no matter what I do and how much optimism I have.
1281,38,75,4Rb2,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/p1rpPn1P/5PK1/1R6/3N4 b - -',At this point I just lost all of my optimism.  Therefore knowing the situation cannot get anyworse I just make a random because there I have nothing better to do anyway.
1282,38,76,4Rc2,b'8/8/5pkp/2p3p1/p2pPn1P/5PK1/1Rr5/3N4 w - -',I thought that this position was surely deadlost for white with no way around it because I looked at either having to retreat my N or allowing him to promote.  Therefore I resigned.  A second look however shows that I actually could have pulled a swindle and wound up like 3 points ahead after 46.Rxc2.  So resignation was probably premature.  Now the only problem is that we could not continue our game because Tom had to leave about 5 minutes afterwards.  So you have to ask yourself why Tom played this then?  Maybe the game was really lost because it looked like my opponent had a plan and therefore.  So it's possible that there would be good reason for sacrificing a major piece in this position IDK.  But what it all comes down to is the moral.  Are you ready?  After the game Tom told me that it is generally not a good idea to record the game.  The reason being is that you spend at least 50% of your time writing down the game.  That's at least half the time that you spend on the actual.  Therefore you wind up losing time and being forced to rush which I have noticed.  Now you really need that time to concentrate on your games.  After he told me that I said that the reason I record is to make an annotation because as a couple of commentators mentioned and I noticed there's pretty much no point in annotating a game if you don't remember what was actually played.  Then my opponent said that the only time it's necessary to record a game is if you're in a tourney.  And the reason being is that part of the tournament rules state that if you're competing in a match you have to record the positions.  In which case then it's worth annotating since you're obligated to write things down anyway.  And he could also see me annotating computer games since the positions are right there with nothing to write about or record.  But that's no need in an informal game like this.  The only other time it might be worth annotating is if one can just remember the positions and was played without writing it down.  But Tom advised me not to try and memorize it like that.  In addition Jack recommended that I follow his advise because he's a strong player and I absolutely agree with my coach.  And that's because concentrating on the actual game is far more important then worrying about what's needed to make the annotation.  I also noticed something else that I didn't before.  Remember what I said in the beginning and early in the annotation where for the first time in a very long while I went for cheapo tactics and cheap shots and it felt like I was in a different time zone?  Well as it turns out writing the positions took away a lot of my energy away and really made me feel tired due to the length and difficulty of this game.  That's why although this was such a great game I wasn't completely with the program and made some beginner mistakes.  It was almost as though I forgot the basics when that didn't really happen.
