25,1,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Standard reply.
26,1,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The King's Gambit leads to many sharp lines.
27,1,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Accepting the gambit is generally considered to be the best reply.
28,1,4,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',Defending the pawn but weakening the kingside.
29,1,5,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And we've arrived at the classic position of the Kieseritsky gambit where White threatens to win back the lost pawn.
30,1,6,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4Pp1P/6p1/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',!?  Interesting.  Black doesn't accept the loss of the pawn and sends the brave soldier to the sixth rank to put pressure on f2.  I'm going to have to be careful not to allow him to exploit it.
31,1,7,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/3PPp1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Taking control of the center and threatening to win the pawn at f4.
32,1,8,Qe7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppppqp1p/8/4N3/3PPp1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?!  Huh?  I would have expected Black to play ..d6 to drive off the knight or ..d5 to fight for the center.  Instead he brings out his queen to threaten my knight which has a defender...
33,1,9,Bxf4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppppqp1p/8/4N3/3PPB1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',... and now has two.  I can now win the pawn at g3 at my leisure.
34,1,10,Qb4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/1q1PPB1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Ahhhhh!  So THAT'S what her majesty decided to come out and play for!  Black has my b2 pawn caught undefended and has an eye out for more-- indeed after Qxb2 my rook is trapped and helpless.  But I had a sense at this point that if Black DID gobble my pawn I would actually be in a stronger position!
35,1,11,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/1q1PPB1P/2N3p1/PPP3P1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Freeing and defending the rook.  Take a look at the position.  White has 3 pieces out including a centralized knight while Black has only the lonely queen out pawn-hunting.  Still good defense might have salvaged the game at least for a little while...

47,1,23,1Bb7,b'N2k1bnr/pb2qp1p/2pp4/8/3PPB1P/3Q2p1/P1P3P1/R3KB1R w KQ -',Take back the Knight!

57,1,33,2Nf6,b'2k4r/pbNq1pb1/2pP1n1p/8/3P1B1P/3Q2p1/P1P1B1P1/1R2K2R w K -',At least the knight can finally move.

65,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is a game played in as you can see dave1973's mini-tournament (in which I am also playing!) which at the time of annotating is still in progress.
66,2,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The Queen's Gambit - my favourite opening. In itself this is not a gambit as White can force the pawn's recapture with 3.Qa4  and 4.Qxc4 but this continuation is useless and rarely played.
67,2,2,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Slav Defence a solid line for Black.
68,2,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the usual move in many lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined.
69,2,4,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I don't like this move. Far better to play 4.e4 and build up a strong pawn centre. 4.e3 is too passive and blocks in the dark-squared bishop.
70,2,5,Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/p3pppp/2p5/qp6/P1pP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The early emergence of a queen on the queenside is relatively common in the Queen's Gambit.
71,2,6,b4,b'rnb1kbnr/p3pppp/2p5/q7/PppP4/4PN2/1P1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',As is seen here one of the factors that White must contend with after the Queen's Gambit Accepted is Black building up massive control over the queenside wing often pushing pawns far into White's territory.
72,2,7,Qh5,b'rnb1kbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/7q/PpBP4/4PN2/1P1B1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black wants to try attacking on the other side. I personally would have preferred keeping the queen where it was and developing more pieces - as you can see Black has developed absolutely no minor pieces.
73,2,8,e4,b'rnb1kbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/7q/PpBPP3/5N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Black will pay for his lag in development - White is building up control of the centre.
74,2,9,1Qc2,b'rnb1k1nr/p4ppp/2pbp3/7q/PpBPP3/5N2/1PQB1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',I would have gone for 9.e5 pushing Black's only developed piecs back. However 9.Qc2 is a good move to shore up the queenside.
75,2,10,1e5,b'rnb1k2r/p4ppp/2pbpn2/4P2q/PpBP4/5N2/1PQB1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Black walked straight into that fork.
76,2,11,1Bxb4,b'rnb1k2r/p1b2p1p/2p1pp2/7q/PBBP4/5N2/1PQ2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Just look at White's superb control. His bishops are powering down on Black's king locking him into the centre.
77,2,12,1Rg8,b'rnb1k1r1/p1b2p1p/2p1pp2/7q/PBBP4/5N2/1PQ2PPP/RN3RK1 w q -',Black controls the open file pressurising White's king in return.
78,2,13,Rg5,b'rnb1k3/p1b2p1p/2p1pp2/6rq/PB1P4/5N2/1PQ1BPPP/RN3RK1 w q -',I would have preferred 14...Qg4 trying to force a way into Black's kingside and if 15.g3 then 15...Qh3 severely threatening and trapping White's queen and then maybe a sacrifice ...Bxg3 or bringing the bishops into the attack in some other way. This could possibly have been a winning attack for Black!
79,2,14,Rg8,b'rnb1k1r1/p1b2p1p/2p1pp2/7q/PB1P4/5NP1/1PQ1BP1P/RN3RK1 w q -',Black has just wasted two moves.

81,2,16,1Nxc6,b'rnbbk1r1/p4p1p/2N1pp1q/2Q5/PB1P4/6P1/1P2BP1P/RN3RK1 b q -',Black's lack of development makes White's breaking into Black's position easy.
82,2,17,Bxc6,b'r2bk1r1/p4p1p/2b1pp1q/1B6/PB1P4/6P1/1P3P1P/RN3RK1 w q -',A queen sacrifice finishes Black off...
83,2,18,2Bxc6#,b'r2bk1r1/p4p1p/2B1pp1q/8/PB1P4/6P1/1P3P1P/RN3RK1 b q -',...WHAM! Checkmate. Note that this would not have been so easy for White if Black had developed his minor pieces sooner and castled as soon as possible...which in turn means he should not have been wasting moves messing around with his queen so early and so much.

111,4,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',this is not quite as bad as it looks with the proper follow up.  Still e6 has to be the best move.  e6 takes the pressure off f7 for a while.  White often follows up with f2-f4-f5 and Black has to choose between ...exf5 or  ...e5 either of which opens things up for the Sozin bishop.  Also there are tactics based on Nd5 exd5 Bxd5 to look out for.

It took him about 2 minutes to make the rounds.  Which was a fair amount of time to think about your move but less than I thought I would have.   Now I had figure out how to defend my d-pawn.

Note his well-placed bishops. White has a more open position also well-developed and is aiming to open up the centre develop a bishop and prepare a semi-open file for his kingside rook after castling with 8.f4.

187,9,1,Ne3,b'5r1k/3q2pp/1p4p1/1Pp1P3/P2p2B1/3Pn2P/2Q3P1/R5K1 w - -',That move I played was very bad. If he took the Queen it was a forces endgame for white 
188,9,2,Re7,b'7k/4r1p1/1p2q1p1/1Pp4p/P2pB3/3Pn2P/4Q1P1/4R1K1 w - -',At this moment we made draw. I hat had one pawn more but at that different ELO rate the draw was ok for me.

204,10,15,3Bg2,b'r1b5/1p6/4p1Rp/2p1k2P/2Pp4/3P4/pP3KB1/n7 b - -',Maybe in his mind there's Bh3 but there's no problem in that way...
205,10,16,a1=Q,b'r1b5/1p6/4p2R/2p1k2P/2Pp4/3P4/1Pn2KB1/q7 w - -',This is the result of a bad-played middlegame.
206,10,17,Qxh5+,b'r1b5/1p6/4p3/2p1k2q/2Pp2R1/3P3K/1Pn3B1/8 w - -', s to take the pawn that was a very little danger anyway.
207,10,18,Kd6,b'r1b5/1p6/3kp3/2p4q/2Pp2R1/3P2K1/1Pn3B1/8 w - -',Kd6 to avoid  s.

209,10,20,4Nxb4,b'r1b5/1p6/3kp3/2p4q/1nPp2R1/3P2K1/6B1/8 w - -',but he didn't see the N.

212,11,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"i played this game at a mini tournament where i was about to regain rating after severe timeout losses. out of an unorthodox reti opening developed the biggest avalanche i ever experienced in chess.

also note that (despite a handful of bishop moves) all blacks pieces only move towards ONE direction ^^"
213,11,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',yeah why not try something new (speaking for myself only)
214,11,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/3P4/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',this brave scout seems to loose contact with his own forces. (this move makes the diagonal for my fianchettoed bishop even juicier)
215,11,3,Na6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n2p1np1/3P4/4P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',black's working the flanks while white does some staging in the center
216,11,4,Nc5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/2nP4/4P3/3Q1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',oh my the infantry ddidnt get enough support and with blacks cavalry in sight white's officer in command leaves the poor men on prey
217,11,5,Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/2nP4/2Q1n3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',the first brawl in the center draws white's attention away from its army's flank...
218,11,6,Bxb2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/2nP4/2Q1n3/3B1N2/PbPB1PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',with severe consequences! white's artillery gets captured!
219,11,7,1Qxe4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3P4/4Q3/5N2/PbPB1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',... but  black's cavalry gets routed and completely annihilated in melee
220,11,8,Bxd5,b'r6r/pp1kp2p/3p1pp1/2pb4/8/2B5/3N1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',now here: due to the uncoordinated movement of white blavck's officers succeeded in routing allready half of white's forces. none of blacks pawn yet was in combat they're all rested and fresh... and they just put on bajonettes and will march the enemy off the field! watch!
221,11,9,Bxc2,b'r6r/3kp3/3p1pp1/p1p4p/1p5P/6P1/2bB1P2/2R3K1 w - -',further simplification. i know that i could have played it more straight but i was so stunned by this pawns i just wanted to let them have fun. (thats the least we can do for our pawns. give them a reason to enjoy theirselves every once in a while. too often they get sacrificed left alone treated as if they were not worth a dime)
222,11,10,Kc6,b'r6r/8/2kp1pp1/p1p1p2p/1p5P/6P1/2RB1PK1/8 w - -',yeah this is surfing a wave!
223,11,11,3Kf2,b'r6r/8/2k3p1/p1p2p1p/1p1ppP1P/6P1/2RB1K2/8 b - -',of course i could have played e3...
224,11,12,3Ke2,b'r6r/8/6p1/p1pk1p1p/1p1ppP1P/6P1/2RBK3/8 b - -',or here d3 would be crushing of course... but i decided to toy
225,11,13,4Rxa5,b'r6r/8/6p1/R4p1p/1pkppP1P/2p3P1/4K3/2B5 b - -',ok my opponent resinged here and i want to apologize that i showed no respect by toying around. although its not often you get such strong story telling situations on the board. and its clearly not every day that you have your 8 pawns and just march the opponent over and dont have to fear a thing. ofcourse id loved to play it down to the 1st rank but chess is a 2player game if its not for any reason its about to be over. like here ^^
226,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Starting with e4 gives black a lot of options but almost all lead to dynamic exciting games.
227,12,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',There is a lot of variety in the Ruy Lopez.  Peterliberty enjoys competing in the exciting world of the unknown.  
228,12,2,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/8/B2pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black chooses the unexpected exd4.  The pin is relieved with b5 and should precede the d-pawn capture.
229,12,3,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/8/B2NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White passes the chance to capture the knight and force black to double pawns on the c-file.
230,12,4,Nxd4,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p2p1n2/8/B2nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',A series of simplifying exchanges begins.
231,12,5,1Be3,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/p2p1n2/8/3QP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',This game is showing no signs of lasting 102 moves.
232,12,6,1b6,b'r4rk1/2pqbppp/pp1p1n2/8/3QP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Is an advance on the Queen-side coming?
233,12,7,Ng4,b'r4rk1/2pqbppp/pp1p4/8/3QP1n1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Or will it be an attack on the King-side?
234,12,8,Bf6,b'4rrk1/2pq1ppp/pp1p1b2/8/3QPBn1/2N4P/PPP2PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Black is choosing to apply pressure on the King-side.  Black's counter attack will be unsuccessful because white holds an advantage in the center.  
235,12,9,1e5,b'4rrk1/2pq1ppp/pp1p1b2/4P3/3Q1Bn1/2N4P/PPP2PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',This forces another exchange of pieces in which black will lose a piece.
236,12,10,2Rxd7,b'5rk1/2pR1ppp/pp6/4p3/8/2N4P/PPP2PP1/6K1 b - -',Black is now at a material disadvantage and is facing the problem of a rook on the 7th rank.
237,12,11,3Ne4,b'5k2/2pR4/p4p1p/1pr2Pp1/4N3/2P4P/PP3K2/8 b - -',White needs to move the King forward in its own defense.  The move allows the tide to turn in black's direction.  Black will soon be causing serious problems for white with his King-side pawn advantage.
238,12,12,3bxc3,b'8/4k3/5p1p/R1p2rp1/4N3/2P1K2P/P7/8 b - -',White will win the game on the Queen-side but first must stop the King-side threat.
239,12,13,3Rf1,b'8/4k3/5p1p/R1p3p1/4N3/2P1K2P/P7/5r2 w - -',Black is now in White's rear.  Even though White has a preponderance of force Black has the advantage of pressure from the front and the rear.
240,12,14,3Nf2,b'8/4k3/5p1p/R1p3p1/8/2P4P/P3KN2/7r b - -',The Knight will be working hard for the remainder of the game.  There's still no sign this game will last 102 moves.
241,12,15,4Kg2,b'8/8/4kp1p/6p1/R1p5/2P4P/P4NK1/r7 b - -',The white King must remain on the King-side in defense of that flank while the black-King takes over in the center.
242,12,16,Rc1,b'8/8/4kp2/R5pp/2p5/2P1N2P/P5K1/2r5 w - -',This move puts black in a very good position and nearly takes the white rook out of the game. 
243,12,17,4Nxc4+,b'8/8/5p2/4k1pp/2N5/R1P4P/P5K1/2r5 b - -',White fears Rc2 .  But the black King is moving into the battle and the Knight will have to do most of the fighting.  White is very uncomfortable right now.
244,12,18,4Nd6+,b'8/8/3N1p2/6pp/4k3/R1P4P/P5K1/2r5 b - -',This prepares for an advance of the c-Pawn a move which will improve white's chances considerably.
245,12,19,4Kf1,b'8/8/3N1p2/6pp/2P2k2/R6P/P1r5/5K2 b - -',White's problem here is stopping the black Pawns.  The King-side Pawn is lost leaving black with two connected King-side Pawns (or two isolated pawns) and King right in the middle of them.  It is not looking good for white.
246,12,20,5Nb5,b'8/8/5p2/1N6/2P2kp1/R7/P1r5/5K2 b - -',White lures the black Rook into capturing the c-Pawn.  Once the black Rook leaves the 2nd rank the white Rook will be able to depart the a-file and become more involved in the action.
247,12,21,5Rxc4,b'8/8/5p2/1N6/2r2kp1/R7/P7/5K2 w - -',Black takes the bait.  Now perhaps white will find a way to stop the King-side attack.
248,12,22,5Nc3,b'8/8/5p2/8/2r2kp1/R1N5/P7/5K2 b - -',White plans to move the Rook to b3 and advance the pawn to a4 then return to a3 where the Rook will guard the pawn's romp to a8.  
249,12,23,Rc8,b'2r5/8/5p2/8/5k2/R1N3p1/P5K1/8 w - -',White should probably proceed with his plan here.
250,12,24,5Nd5+,b'2r5/8/5p2/3N4/5k2/R5p1/P5K1/8 b - -',White decides to first encourage black's forces into a dispersed rather than a coordinated pattern.  
251,12,25,5Rc3,b'2r5/8/5p2/3Nk3/8/2R3p1/P5K1/8 b - -',After 55. . .  Rxc3 56.Nxc3 Kd4 57.a4 the black King cannot take the knight because the a-Pawn runs to the Queening square.  He cannot defend the pawns either because the a-Pawn is free.
252,12,26,5Ra8,b'r7/8/5p2/3Nk3/8/2R3p1/P5K1/8 w - -',Black wisely declines the exchange.  
253,12,27,5a3,b'8/8/5p2/2k5/r7/P5R1/2N3K1/8 b - -',The white Pawn begins its long march to the 8th rank.  Now the game is definitely showing signs of a long struggle.
254,12,28,6Kg3,b'8/8/5p2/8/kNr5/P4RK1/8/8 b - -',White now stands better and the threat on the King-side has all but dissipated.
255,12,29,7Rd2,b'8/8/8/8/1Nk5/P7/2KR3r/8 b - -',White believes he can win with the Knight Pawn and King.  They can now be coordinated.  Eventually the Knight will have to land on c7 providing either checkmate with the Pawn on a7 or preventing the King from going to a8 and either obtaining a stalemate with no place to move or blocking the a-Pawn from promotion.  The Pawn may never reach promotion but will be the key to winning the game.
256,12,30,7Rh3,b'8/8/8/8/1Nk5/P6r/2KR4/8 w - -',Black declines the exchange and is now fighting for a draw in the most advantageous way possible by eliminating white's forces with a timely exchange.
257,12,31,Ka6,b'8/8/k7/3R4/P7/1KN3r1/8/8 w - -',"White continues the march of the foot soldier and black is forced to make generally meaningless moves in the hope that white will open the door for a draw.
"
258,12,32,9Nb6,b'1r6/k7/1N6/PKR5/8/8/8/8 b - -',White was hoping to land the Knight on the crucial c7 square but the black Rook keeps getting in the way.  Oh well if White takes care to avoid a draw he should be able to win.
259,12,33,9Kb6,b'1kN5/8/PKR5/5r2/8/8/8/8 b - -',White cannot advance the Pawn to a7 forcing the King to a8 yet because a forced exchange of the Rooks would end in a draw.
260,12,34,10Rb7,b'kr6/1R2N3/PK6/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',Now we are there.  100. . .  Rxb7 101.axb7  Kb8 102.Nc6     
261,12,35,10Rd8,b'k2r4/1R2N3/PK6/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Black declines the exchange of Rooks but it makes no difference.  
262,12,36,10Nc6,b'k2r4/1R6/PKN5/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',Whatever move black makes now with his Rook the game will end with either Rb8   or Ra7  
263,12,37,10Rxb8#,b'kR6/8/PKN5/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',
264,13,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',See my other annotated games I learnt the Kings gambit 4 months ago and I am always trying it out.

Normally the pawn is defended while the bishop remains at f1 but since the bishop has been committed to c4 protection of the g2 pawn must be considered.

Here is where I get stumped - where do I go from here?  I look back at some of the illustrative games in the World Database and find that the move e5 was played to exchange the central pawns - white drew that game so I thought it was a reasonable plan here.  Maybe a better idea would have been to have played either Bc2 or b3 here at least the former would have avoided what is to come.  I now have a tip for all beginners and intermediate players here - when you come to the end of the database do check to see what is covering what and then decide on what piece to move in order to improve your position especially for overloads like this one otherwise you will worsen it.

Marin stated in a pm in response to my resignation note that I should have taken with the f pawn.  I did consider it but it would have left the f pawn an isolani so I thought that it was better to keep my pawn structure together.  Unfortunately after Marin's next move the irony is that pawn is to fall anyway together with a whole lot more.

Rd1) I go for the line which loses the pawn any other plausible replies such as Nxd7 lose one of the bishops to the pile up on the d file - this is a skewer.  Do note that Glenda is defending both e5 and Frere Leblanc   Frere Lenoir Glenda the Defender is extremely put upon here!  Another plausible try is Ne4 attacking the Wicked Witch of the West but Bxe4 ensures that a piece drops on d3.

634,31,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  This game was even right up to the early middlegame when a tactical shot won me a pawn.  Somehow I managed to increase my lead in material until a king move on black's part finally managed to wrap things up.  You would think that with the queens off the board you are safe from Old Matey - well just remember a rook is also mating material and it is quite possible to crawl into what is known as a mating net.  This game provides an example of this.
635,31,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ......... a6 - a Naijdorf Sicilian - this move is to prepare a later b5 and to stop any knight incursions on that square although it has not been unknown for the white player to sacrifice a knight on b5 for the pawn.
636,31,2,Qd2,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p1npbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',9. Qd2 - standard development and paving the way for queenside castling.
637,31,3,Nd7,b'3nk2r/1p1n1ppp/p7/4p1B1/1b6/1PN2P2/PP4PP/2K2B1R w k -',15. Nd7 - quite a bit has happened in the space of a few moves firstly I castle queenside after an exchange of pawns and then comes a plethora of exchanges leading to the current position.  I now need to develop Frere Leblanc to get my king rook into play.
638,31,4,1Rd1,b'3n1rk1/1p1n1ppp/p7/4p1B1/1b6/1PN2P2/PP2B1PP/2KR4 b - -',17. Rd1 - rook centralised as planned - puts pressure on one of the enemy knights.  Black is about to make his first mistake........

642,31,8,2Bxa6,b'5r2/1R3pk1/B6p/4p3/1b1nN3/1P3P2/PP4PP/2K5 b - -',22. Bxa6 - and another black pawn bites the dust - I now have 3 queenside passers!
643,31,9,Kg5,b'5r2/3R4/7p/b3ppk1/2Bn4/1PN2P2/PP4PP/2K5 w - -',25. ......... Kg5 - not fatal but inaccurate play could result in a snap mate on the side if black is not careful.  I have spent the last few moves controlling all the open files to consolidate my position.  Hopefully I will find a way to finish this game somehow.  Ah what is this I think I have another target here the e pawn!
644,31,10,2Nd5+,b'5r2/4R3/5k1p/b2Npp2/2Bn4/1P3P2/PP4PP/2K5 b - -',27. Nd5  - this knight move becomes pivotal to what is to come later.
645,31,11,2Rxe5,b'5r2/8/7p/b2NRpk1/2Bn4/1P3P2/PP4PP/2K5 b - -',28. Rxe5 - now black is 4 pawns down!  However while he still has his rook and a couple of minor pieces against my own on the board I still have work to do.  Who would have thought though that this game is going to terminate in just four more moves?
646,31,12,2Kb1,b'3b1r2/8/7p/3NRpk1/2Bn4/1P3P2/PP4PP/1K6 b - -',29. Kb1 - Henry decides to back up the a pawn and sidestep any potential pins on the c file.

648,31,14,3Be2+,b'3b1r2/8/2n4p/3NRp2/5Pk1/1P6/PP2B1PP/1K6 b - -',31. Be2  - here I announced mate in 3 and black resigned.  Dmaestro has already given me the correct answer in a pm here but to any other reader can you spot the checkmate.  Answers on a postcard.  Cheers.  Joanne.

652,32,3,Rb6,b'r5k1/1b2bppp/1rp1pn2/2ppN3/P4B2/1PP1P2P/3N1PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now it follows a headache for me. Ra2 in order to prepare the advance of the a pawn or g2-g4 in order to get out the knight from f6 and let me get in in d7 (but it is not clear) or c4 trying to block the doubled black pawns but losing a very good square for my both knights... ????
