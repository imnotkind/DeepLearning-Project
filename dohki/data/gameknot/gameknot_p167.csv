0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I wrote this annotation because I believe a common mistake in chess is for h6 as black tries to prevent a queen pin. As this game proves that move can allow white to blow a hole in the defense. 
1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',As far the center game opening goes I do not believe this move is sound. It doesn't develop black in a meaningful way in fact I think it actually becomes harder for black to defend out of this position. Nc6 I think is the right choice. 
2,0,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Standard attack on the f7 pawn. Not hard to stop. 
3,0,3,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2p5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In trying to prevent queen pin (which cannot happen anyway because of c5 black has created an opening. The knight can no longer shield the f7 pawn. It does not stop the advance of the knight either (Ne5 instead of Ng5). 
4,0,4,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2p1N3/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Obvious
5,0,5,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p1pp1/5q1p/2p1N3/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move is bad for black but I am not sure what he should do to catch up defensively. Nxf7 creates leverage to push the pawn to e5 which will make black's life a lot more difficult. The queen has to move though if black wants to prevent a fork. Maybe Qb6 is this best choice here. 
6,0,6,Qc6,b'rnb1kbn1/pp1p1Npr/2q4p/2p1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Qh4 would have been better. You cannot help but seeing how vulnerable the H file is to white's queen. And at some point black needs to get his b8 knight moving since the other one is basically stuck.
7,0,7,g6,b'rnb1kbn1/pp1p1N1r/2q3pp/2p1P2Q/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',Not sure black has much of a choice here. Realizing check now would be very bad. 
8,0,8,Nd6+,b'rnb1kbn1/pp1p3r/2qN2pp/2p1P2Q/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',This was probably a mistake. Black should take the knight with the queen which forces white to exchange queens. And in this situation that would be bad for white as his queen is a lot more valuable. 
9,0,9,Kd8,b'rnbk1bn1/pp1p3r/2qN2pp/2p1P2Q/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Perhaps trying to hold unto the queen? This is a very bad move the g6 pawn is now lost which threatens the rook. 
10,0,10,Rg7,b'rnbk1bn1/pp1p2r1/2qN2Qp/2p1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The only other choice is rook e7 which immediately costs black the knight. 
11,0,11,Kb6,b'rnQ2bn1/pp1p2r1/1kqN3p/2p1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',From here white cannot get the mate and is so spread out that soon black will be able to force a piece exchange. So how to do the most damage? The knight could pick off the rook if only there was a way to get the king onto c7...
12,0,12,Kxc7,b'rn3bn1/ppkp2r1/3N3p/2p1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',And there it is
13,0,13,1Ne8+,b'rn2Nbn1/ppkp2r1/7p/2p1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',White can now seize a lead in material so as to deprive black a way to launch a meaningful counter. In this situation trading material even for undeveloped pieces is probably okay. 
14,0,14,1Bxg8,b'rn4B1/pp1p2b1/2k4p/2p1P3/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The chips fall where they may. 
15,0,15,1Bb3,b'r7/pp1p4/n1k4p/2p1b3/3p4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',white is now underdeveloped compared to black but it doesn't matter as black as nothing to attack with. 
16,0,16,2axb4,b'r7/p2p4/2k4p/1p2b3/1Pp5/1BN5/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',trade and consolidate. 
17,0,17,2bxc3,b'r7/p2p4/2k4B/1p6/1P6/1pP5/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The passed pawn is a nuisance even dangerous if black had more pieces. Now however it is easy to deal with. Black can create difficulties if he can get the king to c4. Maybe black has a chance to promote if he can reinforce the push with the rook. Although I admit I have no idea how he'd get the rook into play. 
18,0,18,Rh8,b'7r/p7/2k4B/1p1p4/1P6/1pP5/5PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',this doesn't accomplish much the bishop just pulls back to a defendable square. And the rook can't do much after. 
19,0,19,3Rbd1,b'4r3/8/p1k5/1p1p4/1P1R4/2P1B1P1/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',To end this white needs to pin down black's rook and prevent it from attacking advancing pawns. Because black's pieces are all on white squares the ability of the bishop to add pressure is limited. 
20,0,20,3f6,b'8/3r4/p1k2P2/1p1p2P1/1P1R4/2P1B3/7P/3R2K1 b - -',Black either stop the pawn with Rd7 or keep defending his pawn. 
21,0,21,3Rd6,b'8/8/p1kr1P2/1p1p2P1/1P1R4/2P1B3/7P/3R2K1 w - -',Here black either loses
22,0,22,3f7,b'8/5P2/p1kr4/1p1p2P1/1P1R4/2P1B3/7P/3R2K1 b - -',opts to defend but the rook is now married to the back rank to stop promotion. 
23,0,23,4Rd4xd5,b'3r4/5P2/p1k5/1p1R2P1/1P6/2P1B3/7P/3R2K1 b - -',Trading away two rooks for one probably isn't necessary but this probably the fastest way to bring the game to a close.  
24,0,24,Kc2,b'5Q2/8/p5P1/1p6/1P1B4/2P5/2k4P/6K1 w - -',Black resigns. Morale of the story. h6 pawn is not the answer if you need the knight to defend the king pawn. Moving pawns in the opening is a dicey proposition because they can be serious obstructions to your own defense! Move with care. 
25,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was my simul game against retured GM Lars Bo Hansen the former captain of the dutch national team. Of course I didn't have much of a chance but it was fun and we used hour and a half clocks in 18 games so he had time problems. I was white
26,1,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Too much to ask for Ruy Lopez I suppose. I spent a solid minute and a half before deciding he only did that to set up d5. So I pre-empted it.
27,1,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',I wasn't ecstatic about losing my king's pawn this early against a GM but I didn't see a hugely sucessfull way to decline.
28,1,3,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And to prevent my knight getting booted...
29,1,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',To develope pieces prevent a check (giving him extra initiative) and support that d pawn I thought that Nf3 would be best. I still wonder on the best possible move.
30,1,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I decided this was likely so he could play e5 next. instead of preventing the move I undermined its protector.
31,1,6,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/1B1p4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',While he returns favor... I'm not sure if h3 gives me a distinct weakness (I'm not used to playing against players who can exploiut that crazy type of stuff) so I wait and see how he responds to pressure. LAst thing I want to do is play defense against a 2600+.
32,1,7,e6,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p2B1/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',That was so he could develope that bishop and let it out. I wanted to take that knight (because knight tactics always get me and he can probably come up with some insane ones) and I wanted to exchange that g5 bishop but not for the expense of having that f3 knight overloaded with him pinning my queen. I move the queen so I can cover both of my knights. Again I still wish I knew the best move here.
33,1,8,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p2B1/3P4/2NQ1b2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',A true nobrainer move for me next.
34,1,9,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/1B1p2B1/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Well that wasn't too hard to see. He's a subtle player who doesn't leave gaps like that. I think for a while about whether that queenside gap on his side would serve me best on the b or c collumn. Ultimately this move helped undue me so looking back I put a ? beside it on my score card. But I decided that a gap on the b collumn would leave an isolated pawn he would have to work to defend.
35,1,10,bxc6,b'r2qk2r/p3bppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I decide to leave that knight as is because that bishop is dangerous on the diagonal I would have given it. I also wanted to prevent Rb8.
36,1,11,Qb6,b'r3k2r/p3bppp/1qp1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Of course I would do this. I knew that castling queenside would lead to a lot of problems but I also don't want to be down material in this game. So I castled queenside even though I thouht I would do better on the other side.
37,1,12,O-O,b'r4rk1/p3bppp/1qp1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Fortunately I had more pieces on that side. I knew it would be this easy but I was thinking a Qg3 then Bh6 situation... But I didn't think through it too well.
38,1,13,Nh5,b'r4rk1/p3bppp/1qp1p3/3p3n/3P1B2/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Now I don't have anything to prevent Rb8. But I must save the king. 
39,1,14,Nxf4,b'r4rk1/p3bppp/1qp1p3/3p4/3P1n2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',No brainer again
40,1,15,Qa5,b'r4rk1/p3bppp/2p1p3/q2p4/3P1Q2/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',For some reason I decided to play Kb1 here to help defend that pawn. Maybe my second worst move of the game (the worst coming later.) A friend of mine watched me make the movie and actually luaghed out loud... On my score sheet I listed it as Kb1??????? Not only does this not help defend it sets me up to suffer all kinds of crazy tactics without much of an escape route.
41,1,16,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p3bppp/2p1p3/q2p4/3P1Q2/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R w - -',And there it is. I thought the end was knigh here. I moved the queen to f3 so that I could move the knight and the queen would be guarding a valuable row. Also if he moved the queen like I expected he couldn't play Ba3 then.
42,1,17,Rb4,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2p1p3/q2p4/1r1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R w - -',I knew there were way too many things to go wrong on that b2 square... probably a mistake but I also had a trap in mind.
43,1,18,c5,b'5rk1/p3bppp/4p3/q1pp4/1r1P4/1PN2Q2/P1P2PPP/1K1R3R w - -',So far so good for the trip. It sure didn't hurt that it was a simul. In a regular game he would never take it but I thought I saw a way here.
44,1,19,Qxa4,b'5rk1/p3bppp/4p3/2pp4/qr1P4/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/1K1R3R w - -',Bait taken. Now all there was to do was pray I didn't miscalculate.
45,1,20,Rxb3+,b'5rk1/p3bppp/4p3/2pp4/q2P4/1rP2Q2/P4PPP/1K1R3R w - -',I couldn't believe it. I want to run fritz on this game and see if I was actually beating Bo Hansen at this point. I obviously cut it closer than it was. I was in shock.
46,1,21,Qxb3+,b'5rk1/p3bppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/1qP2Q2/5PPP/1K1R3R w - -',I wanted to offer a draw before this move but tournament rules didn't allow it. Unfortunaly I didn't remember that bishop in my now distracted state and I blew the entire game. Would I have pulled it off if I played Ka1? I'll probably never know. I can't calculate it at least.
47,1,22,Bg5+,b'5rk1/p4ppp/4p3/2pp2b1/3P4/1qP2Q2/5PPP/2KR3R w - -',And there's the game. I only had two legal moves and neither were any good. 
48,1,23,Rb8,b'1r4k1/p4ppp/4p3/2pp2b1/3P4/1qP2Q2/3R1PPP/2K4R w - -',There goes the death blow. Literally the only reason I didn't resign here was because I didn't want to lose first.
49,1,24,cxd4,b'1r4k1/p4ppp/4p3/3p2b1/3p4/1qPQ4/3R1PPP/2K4R w - -',Sure. Just throw that in. There's a GM move for you. Instead of pulverizing you this move I'll pulverize you a tiny bit worse in two. But that sets up a bunch of nasty tactics.
50,1,25,Bxd2,b'1r4k1/p4ppp/4p3/3p4/3p4/q1P5/2Qb1PPP/3K3R w - -',Kxd2 ... Rb2 or Qxd2... Rb1. Either way not pretty. But someone else at the end was closing in on a loss so I did it anyways.
51,1,26,2Ke2,b'6k1/p4ppp/4p3/3p4/3p4/q1P5/3QKPPP/1r5R b - -',"I make the move but it's over. I know it. But then someone at the end gets checkmated and I resign. It was good but I blew it on turn 22. No shock but I wish I could have taken that one back. So I resign

He was talking about chess personalities about 3 weeks before at our school. I pinpointed his personality and then asked him how one could beat that type. He said by forgoing subtle games and forcing that person to make sharp distinct moves with lots of pros and cons. Which I tried but that's also a way to lose quicker as well.

At least I can say I was going to go 40 turns against a guy who came 10th in the world open."

227,9,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But the KID isn't one of them. Although it's been played by just about every world champion I still don't have much faith in it. I've played it myself in a few games here but it was more of an experiment than a serious attempt. It's not that I think the opening is bad I just don't like the positions that Black gets out of it in many lines he just seems to be hanging by a thread. White on the other hand...
228,9,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',The classical line which is also the most popular currently. A few decades ago the g3 systems and the Saemisch were very much in favor of the chess elite but playing so protracted has proved unnecessary against this defense. Beside from this position White and Black still have many ways to play and different setups.
229,9,3,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',White's idea is to simple complete development while holding the center for now and wait to see what Black does next.
230,9,4,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',I think it's because of this move that I don't like the KID very much for Black. I mean what's the point of developing the Bishop at g7 if you're just going to hem it in as early as move six behind your own pawns? That being said this move is objectively considered best and almost forced in order to secure a stable situation in the center and complete development.
231,9,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Playing 7. d5 was popular a long time before I was born but isn't anymore. After 7...a5 Black can intertwine his pieces in the center and secure a steady promising game. Since 7...exd4 isn't much of a threat because after 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3! White is just better.
232,9,6,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The point of this Knight sortie is very deep. Black forces White to close the center when he can slowly maneuver the pieces and start K-side operations. Notice that the Knight is better placed on e7 where it doesn't interfere with the Bc8 and from where it supports f5 and can later come to g6. This is just basic stuff about the KID so if you know this already feel free to skip the opening moves.
233,9,7,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',The other alternative is 8. Be3 but the whole thing just looks needlessly messy. Besides hitting a Knight with a pawn is always good fun.
234,9,8,Ne7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',OK here we are. This is the main position of the Classical line. Variations aren't as important here as are ideas and knowing what to do. For example Black's Bc8 is a very important piece even if it doesn't look like it now. The same is true about White's Bc1. Let me just lay out some of the basic plans for both sides. White wants to use his better foothold in the center to squeeze Black's Q-side and win material there. Pushing either of the three pawns there either separate or combined is a good way to achieve this. The c5 break is particularly appealing. Black on the other hand has already burned all his bridges and just wants to mate White. He'll start pushing his K-side pawns and try to land a piece sacrifice somewhere and bring his Queen in for the kill. Both sides try to mix defense and attack into their play and some of games that have been played with this lines by the great chess champions are very instructive.
235,9,9,b4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - b3',This is called the Bayonet attack. The older main line starts with 9. Ne1 and still many lines break off from there.

237,9,11,1Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',A prophylactic move. This strengthens the e-pawn in case of f5 and clears f1 as a retreat square for the Bishop in case Black should play Nf4.
238,9,12,1a5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1npbp/3p2p1/p2Pp2n/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - a6',A secondary variation. 10...f5 is the usual move. The idea of a5 is to make use of the early pawn advanced and remove one target from the Q-side while bring his Rook into play. However this seems wrong in principle since opening lines on the Q-side can only favor me in the long term.
239,9,13,Rxa5,b'2bq1rk1/1pp1npbp/3p2p1/r2Pp2n/2P1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Delaying the capture of the pawn can run into Nd2 and Black's pieces are too far apart to make anything work.

243,9,17,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/2pbnpbp/1p1p2p1/P2Pp3/2P1Pn2/1NN5/5PPP/R1BQRBK1 b - -',Doing just what White is suppose to do in this line open up lines on the Q-side. In hindsight my opponent seems to have tried to do the same thing.
244,9,18,Qb8,b'1q3rk1/2pbnpbp/3p2p1/N2Pp3/2P1Pn2/2N5/5PPP/2BQRBK1 w - -',This is still known theory but the line doesn't seem to promise Black anything good.
245,9,19,1Nb5,b'1q3rk1/2pbnpbp/3p2p1/NN1Pp3/2P1Pn2/8/5PPP/2BQRBK1 b - -',Putting pressure on Black's pawns. Exchanging the Bd7 for the Nb5 will result is a prospectless game for Black which will be left without an attack and with a weak c-pawn.
246,9,20,1f5,b'1q3rk1/2pbn1bp/3p2p1/NN1Ppp2/2P1Pn2/8/5PPP/2BQRBK1 w - f6',Black finally gets to make the most characteristic KID move but this seems like the last nail in his coffin. In any case it's difficult to suggest a plan that can be executed without this move.
247,9,21,2g3,b'1q3rk1/2pbn1bp/3p2p1/NN1Ppp2/2P1Pn2/6P1/5P1P/2BQRBK1 b - -',I think this move deserves an exclamation mark not necessarily because of the lines that support it but for the idea behind it. It comes almost as a direct refutation of Black's last and is a good thing to remember and watch out for as Black.
248,9,22,2exf5,b'1q3rk1/2pbn1bp/3p2p1/NN1PpP1n/2P5/6P1/5P1P/2BQRBK1 b - -',Now Black has to capture with a piece on f5 or lose a pawn. My opponent chose the first but perhaps 21...Nf6 wasn't as bad. Losing a pawn in the KID is less dramatic than in other openings since Black is playing for the attack only his position cannot be sustained by normal means. But perhaps even after 21...Nf6 Black can't hope for much after the very flashy Knight move 22. fxg6 hxg6 23. Nd4! and after a lot of forced exchanges Black is still in misery.
249,9,23,2Nc6,b'1q3rk1/2pb2bp/2Np2p1/1N1Ppn1n/2P5/6P1/5P1P/2BQRBK1 b - -',This Knight has made quite a trip to get here. From g1-f3-d2-b3-a5-c6. And it still can't be put out of the playing field. In case of 22...Bxc6 23. dxc6 Nd4 (more than necessary or else I play c5) 24. Bg2 Qb6 25. Be3 Kh8 26. Qd2 and Black is out of useful moves. The threats are g4 followed by capturing on d4 or capturing on d4 directly. In case of 26...Kg8 27. Qa2! creates even more threats. Black is all tied up.
250,9,24,2Qb6,b'5rk1/2pb2bp/1qNp2p1/1N1Ppn1n/2P5/6P1/5P1P/2BQRBK1 w - -',I think in view of my next move 22...Qb7 would have been more adequate.
251,9,25,2g4,b'5rk1/2pb2bp/1qNp2p1/1N1Ppn1n/2P3P1/8/5P1P/2BQRBK1 b - -',A very easy move to see but not easy to convince myself to make it work. The downside is that my King is weakened and Black gets some activity for his pieces.
252,9,26,2Nh4,b'5rk1/2pb2bp/1qNp2p1/1N1Pp2n/2P3Pn/8/5P1P/2BQRBK1 w - -',23...Bxc6 seems better here since after 24. dxc6 Nh4 25. Qd5+ Kh8 26. Be3 Qb8 Black might just hold. It won't be fun but it might just be tenable.
253,9,27,2Be3,b'5rk1/2pb2bp/1qNp2p1/1N1Pp2n/2P3Pn/4B3/5P1P/3QRBK1 b - -',This Bishop is a late bloomer but it makes up for his inactivity so far.
254,9,28,2Qxe1,b'q4rk1/2pb2bp/3p2p1/NN1Pp2P/2P5/4B3/5P1P/4QB1K b - -',This was the position I wanted when I played 23. g4. Black is in serious trouble here. The material deficit isn't immense but positionally he stands very bad.The c-pawn is very weak his Bishops are very passive. The f-file can't be used for a while and even his King might become weak in the future.
255,9,29,Qxd5+,b'5rk1/2p3bp/3p2p1/NP1qp2P/8/4B3/5P1P/4QB1K w - -',Regaining the material but still behind on position.
256,9,30,Qe6,b'5rk1/2p3bp/3pq1p1/NP2p2P/8/4B3/5P1P/4QBK1 w - -',Black's only hope for counterplay lies in his central pawns. If he can get them rolling far enough he should be able to create enough problems to save the game. But unfortunately for him and fortunately for me he just doesn't have time to do that.
257,9,31,3h6,b'5rk1/2p3bp/3pq1pP/NP2p3/8/4B3/5P1P/4QBK1 b - -',A first finesse. Even though the pawn might drop later it's a serious nuisance and can always be used to intimidate the Black King.
258,9,32,3Bg2,b'5rk1/2p4p/3pqbpP/NP2p3/8/4B3/5PBP/4Q1K1 b - -',The second finesse. Forcing the advancement of the Black pawns is the easiest way to break his position. The point is to be able to fix them and create points for my pieces to blockade them.
259,9,33,3e4,b'5rk1/2p4p/3pqbpP/NP6/4p3/4B3/5PBP/4Q1K1 w - -',32...d5 needs to be looked at as well. After 33. Nc6 e4 (if Black tries to forgo a second pawn advance and hold the pawn abreast Nb4 follows and he's forced to make the concession in worse circumstances) 34. Qa5 Qd6 35. Qa7! Qd7 36. Bc5 Re8 37. Bd4 Qd6 38. Bh3! (with the last piece brought into play Black just can't hold any longer. The c-pawn drops and soon the game)
260,9,34,3Qc1,b'5rk1/2p4p/3pqbpP/NP6/4p3/4B3/5PBP/2Q3K1 b - -',The third and final finesse. This quiet Queen move connects all the pieces.
261,9,35,3Qd5,b'5rk1/2p4p/3p1bpP/NP1q4/4p3/4B3/5PBP/2Q3K1 w - -',33...d5 looks very interesting and it might just draw unexpectedly.. After 34. Qxc7 d4 35. Bf4 e3 36. fxe3 dxe3 37. Qc6 Qxc6 38. Nxc6 e2 39. Bd2 Bg5 40. Bd5+ Kh8 41. Bc3+ Bf6 42. Ne5 e1Q+ 43. Bxe1 Bxe5 44. b6 Rc8 45. b7 Rc1 46. Kf2 Rb1 47. h4 and Black makes a study like draw. He either gives his Rook for my dsb and after which I can't win since I don't have enough material to do so or in case I sacrifice both Bishops to queen the b-pawn erect a fortress which can be easily defended. It just goes to show the richness of a position in chess and that you should never give up looking for saving ideas.
262,9,36,3Bf1,b'5rk1/2p4p/3p1bpP/NP1q4/4p3/4B3/5P1P/2Q2BK1 b - -',Now Black is in too much trouble. His pawns are stuck and he can't formulate a decent plan of action.
263,9,37,3Bc4+,b'5rk1/2p4p/3p1bpP/NP3q2/2B1p3/4B3/5P1P/2Q3K1 b - -',The Bishop belongs on e2 for now but it makes sense to drive away the Black King to the corner.
264,9,38,Rc8,b'2r4k/2p4p/3p1bpP/NP3q2/4p3/4B3/4BP1P/2Q3K1 w - -',36...Bh4 looks more tenacious but I think it's also insufficient. After 37. Qc3+ (37. Qxc7 wins as well but in more moves) Qf6 38. Qxf6+ Bxf6 39. Bc4 and the White pieces will slowly make good work of the Black Rook and Bishop.
265,9,39,3Qb7,b'2r4k/1Qp4p/3pqbpP/NP6/4p3/4B3/4BP1P/6K1 b - -',Vacating c6 for the Knight.
266,9,40,3Nc6,b'2r4k/1Qp4p/2N1qbpP/1P1p4/4p3/4B3/4BP1P/6K1 b - -',And here my opponent resigned. My guess is that he ran out of ideas. The Rook can't move or else c7 drops. Nd4 is also a big idea as is b6. It's not so nice to have so many threats and not be able to execute them because your opponents wants to surrender.
267,10,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"....... a DRAW with the Master Mater!

Hi everyone!

This is my longest ever game with Master Freddy and I am pleased to say that after 50 losses I finally opened my account with the Master Mater who is not called that for nothing!  Operation Joblock finally triumphed.  Anyhow this marathon started off with Freddy playing 1. c4 which is the English Opening."
268,10,1,Qc2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PPQPPPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',2. Qc2 - unusual but in the db it favours white.
269,10,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/4P3/PPQP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',3. ...... Nc6 - normal development - btw there is an un-annotated version of the game in GOM where I did request gameknot analysis so you can follow the game there.
270,10,3,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/P1N1PN2/1PQP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',6. ..... d6 - opening the lines for Fou Leblanc.
271,10,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/P1NPPN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',7. ...... 0-0 - for once I feel confident about putting Henry away on the kingside.  Freddy strangely enough does not think about an h4 pawn push which he lurves doing sometimes.
272,10,5,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/P1NPPN2/1PQ1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',9. 0-0 - Freddy also hides his king on the kingside.
273,10,6,Rb8,b'1rq1r1k1/pppb1pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/PPNPP3/2QNBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',11. ...... Rb8 - bolstering the b2 pawn.
274,10,7,1dxe4,b'1rq1r1k1/1ppb1pbp/p1np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/PPN1P3/1BQ1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',14. dxe4 - after 14 moves the first captures a pair of knights is exchanged.
275,10,8,1Nd5,b'1rq1r1k1/1pp1npbp/p2p2p1/3Np3/2P1PPb1/PP2P3/1BQ1B1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',17. Nd5 - this move sparks off a few more trades.
276,10,9,1cxd5,b'1rq1r1k1/1pp2pbp/p2p2p1/3Pp3/4PP2/PP2P3/1B2Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',19. cxd5 - interesting recapture exd4 would have undoubled the centre pawns but Freddy is probably planning an attack down the c column.
277,10,10,2Qc4,b'1rq1r1k1/1pp3bp/p2p1pp1/3Pp3/2Q1PP2/PP2P3/1B4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',20. Qc4 - sure enough the Wicked Witch of the West moves to the c column.
278,10,11,Qd7,b'1r2r2k/1ppq2bp/p2p1pp1/3Pp3/2Q1PP2/PP2PR2/1B4PP/3R2K1 w - -',21. ...... Qd7 - after Freddy's rook lift which could spell a kingside mating attack Glenda prepares to move over to the kingside to protect Henry.
279,10,12,g5,b'1r2r2k/1ppq2bp/p2p1p2/3PpPp1/2Q1P3/PP2PR2/1B4PP/3R2K1 w - -',22. ..... g5 - the first action of Operation Joblock.  A pawn advances to close up my position.
280,10,13,Rc8,b'2r3k1/1ppqr1bp/p2p1p2/3PpPp1/2Q1P3/PPB1P2R/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',25. ..... Rc8 - getting the c7 pawn adequately covered is a good thing because my KR is needed to defend my weakened kingside position here.
281,10,14,Bf8,b'2r2bk1/1ppq1r1p/p2p1p2/3PpPp1/1B2P3/PP1QP2R/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',27. ...... Bf8 - it's musical squares for Fou Lenoir and my KR.
282,10,15,Rg7,b'2r2bk1/1ppq2rp/p2p1p2/3PpPp1/4P3/PP1QP2R/6PP/2R1B1K1 w - -',28. ..... Rg7 - in the chat I said to Freddy that in putting my rook in front of Henry on g7 that rook was also looking at his king.  If Freddy was now to advance his pawns he would risk exposing his own king to an attack.
283,10,16,Qd8,b'2rq2k1/1pp1b1rp/p2p1p1R/3PpPp1/2R1P3/PP1QP3/6PP/4B1K1 w - -',30. ...... Qd8 - Glenda heads for e8 to stop her counterpart getting to h5.  If she does Glenda is prepared to sacrifice her life for the Witch.
284,10,17,3a4,b'1r1q2k1/1pp1b1rp/p2p1p1R/3PpPp1/PR2P3/1P1QP3/6PP/4B1K1 b - -',32. a4 - Freddy now starts pushing for a possible queenside opening.  He ain't gonna get it!
285,10,18,b6,b'2rq1bk1/2p3rp/pp1p1p1R/B2PpPp1/P1R1P3/1P1QP3/6PP/6K1 w - -',34. ..... b6 - oh rid me of this turbulent priest!
286,10,19,Ra8,b'r2q1bk1/2p3rp/1pRp1p1R/p2PpPp1/P3P3/1P1QP3/6PP/4B1K1 w - -',36. ..... Ra8 - I do not wish the Wicked Witch to come into a6.
287,10,20,Kf8,b'3q1k2/r1p1b1rp/1pRp1p1R/pQ1PpPp1/P3P3/1P2P3/6PP/4B2K w - -',39. ..... Kf8 - a lot of piece shuffling has been going on over the last few moves now the two kings get in the mood!
288,10,21,Kg8,b'4q1k1/r1p1b1rp/1pRp1p1R/p2PpPp1/P3P3/1PB1P3/4Q1PP/7K w - -',41. .... Kg8 - more piece shuffling.
289,10,22,Kg8,b'4q1k1/r1p1b1rp/1pRp1p1R/p2PpPp1/P3P3/1PB1P1PP/4Q3/7K w - -',43. ...... Kg8 - white's position here is more active but should Freddy over-reach himself with the following ....... 44. h4 gxh4 45. gxh4 Qf7 46. Rh5 Rg3 47. Rh6 Qg7 48. Rh5 Rg1+ 49. Kh2 Qg3# So Operation Joblock could finally bare its teeth - a lurvely 18 point chunk out of the Master Mater's rating! Freddy must take care.
290,10,23,Qf7,b'5k2/r1p1bqrp/1pRp1p1R/p2PpPp1/P3P1Q1/1PB1P1PP/7K/8 w - -',45. ..... Qf7 - reinforcing the h7 pawn.

293,10,26,Rb7,b'3b2k1/1rp3rp/1pRp1p2/p2PpP2/P3P1PR/1P2P1K1/3B4/8 w - -',52. ....... Rb7 - the shuffle continues.

295,10,28,Bd8,b'3b2k1/1rp3rp/1pRp1p2/p2PpP2/P3P1P1/1P2P1K1/2R5/4B3 w - -',56. ..... Bd8 - again I must attend to the weak backward c7 pawn.
296,10,29,Kf7,b'3b4/1rp2krp/1pRp1p2/p2PpP2/P3P1P1/1P2PK2/2R5/4B3 w - -',57. ..... Kf7 - my first draw offer ......

299,10,32,Ra7,b'3b2k1/r1p3rp/1p1p1p2/p2PpP2/P3P3/1P2PK2/2R5/4B2R w - -',61. ...... Ra7 - and we do the shuffle again!

301,10,34,Kf7,b'3b4/r1p2krp/1p1p1p1R/p2PpP2/P3P2B/1P2PK2/8/7R w - -',64. ..... Kf7 - because the enemy dsb cuts communication between the two rooks Henry can move to f7 to defend f6.  In the ensuing endgame Henry is gonna be a right pain in the you know where for Freddy teeheehee!
302,10,35,6b4,b'3b2k1/r1p3rp/1p1p1p1R/p2PpP2/PP2P3/4PKB1/8/7R b - -',66. b4 - another pawn sac this time a temporary one to open up some lines of attack for Freddy's rooks.
303,10,36,b3,b'3b2k1/r1p3rp/1p1p1p1R/3PpP2/P3P3/1p2PKB1/8/R7 w - -',67. ...... b3 - might as well advance.

305,10,38,Ke8,b'3bk3/2p3rp/1p1p1p2/r2PpP2/P3P3/1p2PK2/5B2/RR6 w - -',70. ...... Ke8 - Henry is very flexible.  He is moving goalie like to defend kingside or queenside as and when required.
306,10,39,Rxb5,b'3b4/2pk2rp/1p1p1p2/1r1PpP2/P3P3/4PK2/5B2/R7 w - -',"72. ...... Rxb5.  In the chat I said this to Master Freddy. ""Hi Freddy I just hope I haven't taken 3 days to make a blunder - that usually happens against you. I did give the exchange a lot of thought and I am aware that it will open up the a column for your rook but on the other hand my pawn structure will remain intact after you recapture. If I allowed you to take the rook then that would have left me with an isolani on the a column and you would have had a passed a pawn. Therefore I thought that the rook exchange was the better option. I feel that Henry and Fou Lenoir can hold the fort on the queenside should your rook decide to come down the a column. Hence the second draw offer."" "
307,10,40,7axb5,b'3b4/2pk2rp/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP2/4P3/4PK2/5B2/R7 b - -',"73. axb5.  Freddy declined this draw offer and said ""you are almost there but not just yet!"" "
308,10,41,Kb7,b'3b4/1kp3rp/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP2/4P3/4PKB1/8/R7 w - -',74. ..... Kb7 - Henry moves to b7 to stop a rook incursion.
309,10,42,Kc8,b'2kb4/2p3rp/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP2/4P3/4PKB1/6R1/8 w - -',77. .... Kc8 - a rook trade is on the cards so Henry decides to move back to the kingside to stop his counterpart invading there.
310,10,43,7Kxg2,b'2kb4/2p4p/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP2/4P2B/4P3/6K1/8 b - -',79. Kxg2 - the trade does take place and so Henry races back to the kingside.  The queenside is completely locked so I feel confident of the final outcome here!  Big words against an opponent like the Master Mater.
311,10,44,Kf7,b'3b4/2p2k1p/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP2/4P1KB/4P3/8/8 w - -',81. ...... Kf7 - Henry will certainly stop the enemy king in his tracks.

313,10,46,8Be7,b'8/2p1b1kp/1p1p1p2/1P1PpP1K/4P3/4P3/8/4B3 w - -',"83. ...... Be7  - with this move I said the following to Freddy in the chat - Can you now see a way through the Joblock?! Fou Lenoir can still move about so I do not see you giving me a zugzwang here!
easy19: it is not the joblock it just have the wrong bishop and i am out of options jstevens1: So it looks like a draw after all!
easy19: yep it is now make it a 3 fold it would be well deserved

I did try and do just that only I forgot to tick the check box but at the second attempt I did do it and the game was drawn.  This is only my second draw against Master strength opposition.  Do not knock the Joblock my friends note that Freddy had to sac material to risk losing to try and avoid conceding a Low Draw.  One day an Expert such as Coach Ion may well over-reach himself in this way and pay the full penalty!  For now I will just enjoy this result and then look to regain my Class A status.  Have a good read - bye for now - Joanne

322,11,7,1Bh4,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbpp1/p2p1n1p/4pP2/4P2B/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',here i studied carefully the next 10 moves... And I decided I was up one pawn.

I rather expected him to exchange on f4 and play d4. I thought that c3 was played preparing d4. However he had another plan.

Probably just Ng8 to prevent the knight check on f7 is best or maybe Na5 hitting the queen. After 15. Nf7check Kg8 16. Nh6 check Kh8 White HASN'T got 17. Qg8 mating as instead of taking the queen with rook - which does allow Nf7 mate black can capture the queen with N(e7)

Black can continue with h6 and g5 try and muster up an attack down the f file. Black probably hasn't enough compensation for the pawn but in a Rapid Play tournament like this probably has reasonable chances. If white takes the pawn with the Bishop after 15. Bxf3 h6 16. Nf7check Kh7 white is in serious danger of getting his knight trapped on f7. White didn't take the pawn though.

Qd7 is an interesting move normally the bishop is in front of the queen on the diagonal but in this case there is nothing to stop the black queen from invading the white position. As we shall see this move also contains a threat to the white queen.

It had been a long time since I last played a game with Coach Ion.  The last time I played him I was lucky to get a High Draw against him.  I found out he was playing in the Traxler so I decided to join it!  I am playing him at the moment but I can report that I have managed to get my first win of the tournament against a Class C Player with the black pieces.  I ended up investing an enormous amount of material (-9 the equivalent of a whole queen down) but my opponent lost his king so it was worth it.  Gameknot analysis has been requested and you will find the game in my past games profile.

It is really nice to follow up my epic draw with the Master Mater with a victory that has pushed my rating within touching distance of Class A 1800+ status.  This victory was against a Class C player by the name of Steve.  Steve wasn't doing too badly until he left a pawn en prise which allowed Glenda to wreak mayhem in his camp.  Steve was aware that his b pawn was en prise but he thought he could trap Glenda.  Unfortunately for him he only realised I had a saving resource after he hit the submit button - I know the feeling there Steve just look at my 50th game against the Master Mater on Move 11 when I thought I was gonna win Freddy's rook but then instead found myself bereft of Fou Lenoir.  Sadly Steve's game went downhill after that.  Anyhow Gameknot analysis is provided for this game:  Please look in my past games profile dated 7.11.10 for the game."

Note white's lsb is PINNED to the rook on d2 and now that rook is trapped and white now must give up a further piece to try and save it.

690,30,20,Nc7,b'r1b2rk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp1pP2/P1Pp4/1B1P1QPP/3B1P2/RN2K1NR w KQ -',I played this move for two reasons one I expose the f pawn to the bishop's attack and two I prepare for the possibility that he finds a way to snake out of the pin with tempo.  The opponents style of play so far suggested to me that he would not take rook and knight for queen.
691,30,21,1Qe4,b'r1b2rk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp1pP2/P1PpQ3/1B1P2PP/3B1P2/RN2K1NR b KQ -',A definite mistake.  The b pawn will prove insufficient compensation for the f pawn assuming that black does not play Rxf5.  Black likes Bxf5 because the queen has already moved twice without compensation.
692,30,22,2Qe2,b'r4rk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp1pb2/P1Pp4/1B1P2PP/3BQP2/RN2K1NR b KQ -',Defensive.

696,30,26,Bxf3,b'r4rk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp5/P1Pp4/1B3bPP/3BQ3/RN2K1NR w KQ -',In a typical King's Indian the light-squared bishop is the sacrificial piece usually at h3.  Black is daring white to capture the piece.
697,30,27,Rae8+,b'4rrk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp5/P1Pp4/1B3bPP/3B3Q/RN2K1NR w KQ -',Increasing pressure but black may be better off with Bxh1.

699,30,29,2Rxe2+,b'5rk1/1pn3pp/1b1q2n1/pPp5/P1Pp4/1B3bPP/3Br2Q/RN2K2R w KQ -',Tempting was d3 squeezing the life out of the position but with white's forces so uncoordinated getting the queen off the board seemed to promise more more quickly.

702,30,32,Nf4,b'6k1/1pn3pp/1b6/pPp5/P1P2n2/Nq1p3P/3B1r2/R1K1R3 w - -',And black finds a winning continutation.

704,30,34,dxe2,b'6k1/1pn3pp/1b6/pPp5/P1P5/1q5P/3Bpr2/RNK5 w - -',White resigns.  It probably seems to him that black is purposefully playing the weaker moves to illustrate the point that white is dead to rights but once the idea of Ne2+ hit black he seemed to have forgotten Qc2# twice.  Black is too busy looking at 33...Rf1+ 34.Be1 Rxe1+ 35.Kd2 Qd1+ 36.Ke3 e1=Q#
705,31,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',first game with argentinian Ricardo. I salute thou. 
706,31,1,f5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq f6',These good players always like better what I dislike. If you want to punish me play f5 with black: i always will be embarrassed. In this game I succeeded to outpast the opening fortunately.
707,31,2,Ng5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/5pN1/2PPp3/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I admit I searched for this solution. I had no idea before to play Ricardo what to do here. And I must admit it is very intersting.

709,31,4,1Bb2,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/2n4p/3q1p2/3Pp3/2P3P1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I was thinking to myself that this position is very promising for both camp. black has more space but white has the two bishops well placed with a lot of possible discoveries.
710,31,5,1f4,b'r1b2r2/ppp3pk/2n4p/3q4/3Ppp2/2P3P1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',and more space to black
711,31,6,Bf5,b'r4r2/ppp3pk/2n4p/3q1b2/3Ppp2/2P3P1/PBQ1PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',I must admit i underestimated this move
712,31,7,1axb3,b'r4r2/ppp3pk/2n4p/5b2/3Ppp2/1PP3P1/1B2PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',But still think I am better here. What do you think ricardo?

716,31,11,2b4,b'r7/r3n1pk/ppp5/5b1p/1PPPp3/4PpPP/RB3P1K/R4B2 b - -',and I was pretty sure I could pass here.

719,31,14,g6,b'r1b5/r3n3/p1p3pk/R5Rp/1PBPp2P/2B1PpP1/5P1K/8 w - -',and now what? I am still blocked in my hopes to play d5 because b4 will be exposed to rooks attack after exchanges.

724,31,19,4Be1,b'3r4/8/B1p4k/3n3p/1P1Pp2P/4PpP1/5P2/4BK2 b - -',another blunder. I think.

728,31,23,Rc3,b'8/8/4B3/3Pk2p/4p2P/2r2pP1/8/5K2 w - -',i resigned. last ten-fifteen moves are obvious ones. I had nothing more... good game by Ricardo
729,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I start off with e4 as it often leads to wild tactical play.
730,32,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My opponent responds with a Sicilian common among high level players.
731,32,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',I decided to go for the grand prix as I would easily lose a steady positional game. In fact I hope to play the infamous Bryntse gambit which is 1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ with an all-out attack.
732,32,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But my opponent does not comply. Oh well...
733,32,4,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',My opponent places his bishop to a strong square. He also prepares to castle. If he does I would have a hard time to break through his defenses.
734,32,5,f5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p2P2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I try to open some lines toward Black's monarch as a wild tactical play (which is my favourite type of play) is my best bet to at least draw the game.
735,32,6,gxf5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n5/2p2p2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He accepts the gambit. The h5-e8 diagonal has somewhat opened for business.
736,32,7,Bxf7+,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1ppBbp/2n5/2p2p2/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Why not?
737,32,8,Ng5+,b'r1bq2nr/pp1ppkbp/2n5/2p2pN1/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',I have to keep the king in check or else he can escape.
738,32,9,Kg6,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n3k1/2p2pN1/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Black gets somewhat greedy and attacks my lone knight. Mybe better was Kf8. Now...
739,32,10,exf5+,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n3k1/2p2PN1/8/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',Of course! If I can bring his king towards my pieces I may be able to mate him! That would be great...
740,32,11,Kxg5,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n5/2p2Pk1/8/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Black is really greedy here. I don't know if there is a better move though.
741,32,12,d4+,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n5/2p2Pk1/3P4/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQ d3',Of course!
742,32,13,Kf6,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n2k2/2p2P2/3P4/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',He retreats to a square where I can't check him without simply losing a piece. What to do?
743,32,14,1Qh5,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n2k2/2p2P1Q/3P4/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',! I cut any escape the black king had and I threaten Bg5+ which would be very dangerous.
744,32,15,1Nxd4,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/5k2/2p2P1Q/3n4/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',He brings in his knight and frees the e5 square for his.
745,32,16,1Bg5+,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/5k2/2p2PBQ/3n4/8/PPP3PP/RN2K2R b KQ -',Of course!
746,32,17,1Kd1,b'r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/8/2p1kPBQ/3n4/8/PPP3PP/RN1K3R b - -',This move serves two purpose: It protects the c2 pawn while allowing my rook on the e file. My king cannot be checked for now as well.
747,32,18,1d5,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2ppkPBQ/3n4/8/PPP3PP/RN1K3R w - d6',? Black tries to develop his pieces while giving cover squares for his king. However...
748,32,19,1Bf4+,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2ppkP1Q/3n1B2/8/PPP3PP/RN1K3R b - -',I won't allow the black king to escape! If the black king goes to f6 I simply plays Bg5+. He must either take the perpetual or lose his queen (at least). However if he takes my bishop...
749,32,20,1Kxf4,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp1P1Q/3n1k2/8/PPP3PP/RN1K3R w - -',??Which he does... 
750,32,21,1Re1,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp1P1Q/3n1k2/8/PPP3PP/RN1KR3 b - -',!! Deadly move. I cut off any escape square from the black king. I also threaten g3# which is almost unavoidable.
751,32,22,1Nxf5,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp1n1Q/5k2/8/PPP3PP/RN1KR3 w - -',The ONLY MOVE!
752,32,23,1g3+,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp1n1Q/5k2/6P1/PPP4P/RN1KR3 b - -',Of course.
753,32,24,1Rg1+,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp3Q/8/6k1/PPP5/RN1K2R1 b - -',? Re3+ is better as it forces mate quicker. And I must NOT play 17.Qg5+ because of 17...Bg4+ 18.Kc1 Bh6 pinning my queen to my king. DO NOT WANT. Those bishops can be pesky here. 
754,32,25,1Kf4,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp3Q/5k2/8/PPP5/RN1K2R1 w - -',? Surprisingly Kf2 is better­ (I think). I now see the forced mate...
755,32,26,1Qg5+,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/5k2/8/PPP5/RN1K2R1 b - -',Of course! My queen switches from light square control to dark squares control. My b1 knight shall go to d2 where it controls three key light squares.
756,32,27,1Ke4,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/4k3/8/PPP5/RN1K2R1 w - -',18...Kf3 19.Nd2+ Kf2 20. Qg3#

758,32,29,1Kd4,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/3k4/8/PPPN4/R2K2R1 w - -',Only move.
759,32,30,2c3+,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/3k4/2P5/PP1N4/R2K2R1 b - -',Of course! the king must go to d3.
760,32,31,2Kd3,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/8/2Pk4/PP1N4/R2K2R1 w - -',Forced
761,32,32,2Rg3#,b'r1bq2nr/pp2p1bp/8/2pp2Q1/8/2Pk2R1/PP1N4/R2K4 b - -',CHECK and MATE! After many sacrifices to bring the black king near my pieces I finally finish him off. Since this was in a simul I can't take full credits for that. However it is still a victory against an IM with a totally unsound opening and a sack-fest of pieces. Even though we both made mistakes it was very fun to play. Please feel free to leave any comments and/or feedback whether it is positive or negative. That way I will be able to make better annotations. Until then Adieu!
762,33,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Everything is standard so far.
763,33,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Interesting. I was hoping that it would end quickly just like Legall's famous game but my hopes were futile.
764,33,2,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A bit of a poor move by Black. I already have two knights developed and Black should instead focus on a move like 3. ... Nf6 or 3. ... Nc6.
765,33,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Sure Black's pawn on h6 was helping to stop my knight coming to g5 but I sensed that I had an advantage here.
766,33,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',This is an alright move as I wanted to open up the position. 5. d3 might have been better.
767,33,5,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I decide to recapture using the queen instead of the knight. Black is very open to attack and so has to be careful.
768,33,6,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2bpp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',A mistake. I can now capture the pawn on g7.
769,33,7,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2bpp1/2pp3p/4P3/2BQ4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Unfortunately I didn't see it. Instead I block the possibility. After 7. Qxg7 Black can only defend the rook with 7. ... Bf6 after which I can play Qxf7#.
770,33,8,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2bpp1/2np3p/2pQP3/2B5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Now Black is in serious trouble.
771,33,9,Qxf7+,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2bQp1/2np3p/2p1P3/2B5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',This is similar to Scholar's Mate but with one vital difference. Black's king can run to d7.
772,33,10,Kxd6,b'r1bq2nr/pp2bQp1/2nk3p/2p5/2B5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black gets greedy. Not something you want to do when you're in this type of situation.
773,33,11,1Be6#,b'r1bq2nr/pp1kbQp1/2n1B2p/2p5/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Stunning. I never would have expected myself to pull something like this off. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game or want to leave me feedback please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.
774,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The first 6 moves are the standard moves for this project.  Our free choice starts thereafter.
775,34,1,Bxf7+,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Standard practice in this and the previous two annotation tourneys.
776,34,2,Kc7,b'rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',8...Ke8 offers a draw by repetition - hardly in keeping with the spirit of the tourney though our leader easy19 has used it to befuddle his opponents.
777,34,3,Kb6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Black has to avoid the fork of K and Q from e6 so either the K moves here or d6 or the Q moves.  ...Qe8 is proving quite a popular move in this tourney.  ...Qd4 or ...Qd5 have been less successful.
778,34,4,1Ne6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',This N dominates the board and prevents Black's B from developing naturally.
779,34,5,1Qe8,b'rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',As previously noted this is the favourite square for the Q.  I'm not sure whether it is better to move the Q here instead of 9...Kb6 or leave it to this move.  Chances is are it's just a case of transposition.
780,34,6,1d3,b'rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',White hastens to activate the second B threatening to exploit the g1-a7 diagonal.

782,34,8,c5,b'r3qb1r/pp1np1pp/1k2N3/2p5/4pPB1/3PB3/PPP3PP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Black blocks the diagonal even though it is unlikely he can defend the pawn indefinitely.  Freddy's advice to Black is to block the Bishops' activity almost at any cost.

If Black doesn't create the hole then White may play 15. Nd5+ Ka6 16. Ndc7+ or 15. Nd5+ Kc6 16. c4.  Perhaps that would be better for Black...  The computer actually recommends 14...Ka6 preempting the above lines.

Retreating my Ne4 would lose the d pawn if I protect it with f5 or Bf5 he can exchange on e4 and then take on d6 and if d5 then he has Nc7 then he can exchange on e6 and e4 and leave me with weak doubled e pawns. So I decided just to carry on with my plan.

Black's N will go to e6 (after the eventual pawn exchange) where it will blockade the white e-pawn and black will start putting pressure on d4 which white will not be able to hold as his B is on the wrong color squares.
