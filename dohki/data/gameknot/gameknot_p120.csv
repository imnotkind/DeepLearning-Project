That is because I castled without thinking.  In an article Grandmaster Natalia Pogonina said ""Many people castle automatically without giving it any real thought.  Not a good idea.""  According to Natalia it is usually good to castle because your king is generally under attack.  However there are occasions where you should not castle because your king is not attacked.  When this happens it is better to use your king as a weapon.  If however you should castle it is a good idea to judge where.  If your opponent is attacking from the Kingside it is good to castle Queenside.  On the other hand if your opponent is attacking from the Queenside it is good to castle Kingside.  Therefore it is a good choice to castle on the opposite side from where your opponent is attacking.  That is if you are going to castle.  "

It is important not to rush and to take your time before you make a move.  When you are sick however it is important take longer in making a move.  In other words it is a good idea to move slower when you are sick.  If you feel ""under the weather"" it is much harder to concentrate so you need more time to rest.  After all it is extremely important to get enough rest when you have a cold.

We fought like true warriors from beginning to end and Jose didn't deserve to lose in such way but at the end justice was done since black had a big advantage for most of the rook ending.  This is also the longest game we have ever played against each other. 84 moves is our new record.  Also this game marked the first occasion in this year when one of us won two games in a row for the first time but more importantly my victory was very significant for me since by only 2 days short of a one year anniversary from winning a game against Jose with the black pieces. I just hope that I won't have to wait another year to complete such a difficult task again.  Thank you for the game my friend.

The Sozin is a positional system that puts steady pressure primarily on Black's center and White typically castles toward his KR. In the Richter-Rauzer White initiates an often bluntly tactical K-side attack usually featuring a raging pawnstorm and so he almost always castles long the better to facilitate it. Mixing the systems can be done but because their goals are dissimilar pursuing both strategies at once can easily lead to a confused game for White.

This thrust used to be played commonly then fell out of favor after White started sacking on b5 often getting lasting positional pressure for the piece plus all those joined unopposed Q-side pawns staring Black into the endgame. The move has lately come back into fashion as defensive resources have improved and the complications no longer favor White as much as they once did. Still Black walks on brittle ice and must play the defense very precisely if White accepts the challenge to sac a piece as he does here.

The text obviously supports a push to d4 (even after a preliminary attempt at a break at b4) ...which lets the e-pawn hang. Or perhaps White wants to stop Black's Knight from hopping to d4 ...where it could then easily be chased by the c-pawn or exchanged from f3. I don't know what White was thinking to engage in this pointless dithering.

The right move was 9. Be3 continuing to put pressure on the square.

It was said by Fischer of Petrosian that the great Russian defensive genius had a gift for making innocuous-looking pawn moves in the opening that turned out to have great prophylactic significance 15 or 20 moves later in the middle game. That's not the case here. Black's ""dithering"" at least threatens ...b5 gaining space and a tempo."

Re: blake78613's various comments: The proof is in the pudding. If White was trying out a new variation in this game one could only say it met with resounding failure. Let me point out also that the Sicilian isn't the Ruy Lopez/Spanish game: the Sicilian is a fighting defense from the first move and both players seek dynamic chances and counter-chances. Some variations are more positionally-minded true but none are cautious by nature or sedate and all of them bristle with tactical fireworks simmering barely below the surface. It's my considered opinion that White's plan - if plan he had - was poor in both conception and execution against a defense as aggressive as the Sicilian. What makes my judgment valid you may ask? Well just take a look at the ratings of some of the Gameknot players my Annotated Games list includes. One final note: The Danish GM Bent Larsen was noted for his occasional barbed comments when analyzing games: I recall one (not one of his own games) where he bluntly wrote ""In my opinion both players are losing here"" and earlier had said of Black ""His whole game is incomprehensible."" When I analyze I state my opinion about the position. If the reader doesn't like it that's fine: he's free to look at someone else's games."

It allows the g8 Knight to develop to f6 with ease if 4.d4 isn't played and it prepares the Bishop to go to d7.

Black resigns with an obliterated Queenside and many critical threats in the next 5-10 moves. Black had two chances to save his pices. The first chance could have prevented point loss and the second could have prevented the whole game from collapsing for Black. Use your opportunities wisely especially since they come and go quickly. 9...a6 even though it loses a point was something for Black to have thought about. It's a fragile move but it doesn't mean that it doesn't do anything it means that there can be other purposes for each move that were not recently identified. A position is strong if constructed of logic; a weak position is constructed of everything else.

The queen is bad placed here because he blocks the way of his bishop; black will have to lose tempo if he wants to castle on the king side or develop his rook. It's quite obvious now that black gonna try to castle on his queen side.

Nc3 would have been fine but it would have blocked the way for my queen if I wanted to attack on the queen side. Bg5 would have been too slow I think. My main concern right now was to block the castling of white on the queen side that's why I have castled right now. If black does Nc6 instead of Nd7 I would get a great advantage.
