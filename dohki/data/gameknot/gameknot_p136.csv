30,1,17,6Kg2,b'6r1/6p1/7p/3R4/1PnPkN2/6PP/5PK1/3B4 b - -',Now very closed to the end. He did not realized that that would be the end. So thinking of move the Rook instead of leaving the game.
31,1,18,6Bf3#,b'5r2/6p1/7p/3R4/1PnPkN2/5BPP/5PK1/8 b - -',That is the end! I feel that It was a nice game I played.

In my experience with playing this player she moves her a and h pawns in order to prevent the bishops from pinning her knights.  I respond as Black by deploying my gN to f6.

a) 3...g6 so black can fiancheto the bishop and regain some pressure over d4
b) 3...e6 with the idea Nge7 if possible before the exchange of white's bishop then Bb5 would lack it's point
c) 3...d6 preparation of Bd7 after exchange Bxc6 Bxc6 black would exert pressure over e4
d) 3...a6 in my opinion a bad choice as it loses one tempo so white can exchange and black could have developed a piece or opened some lines with a pawn advance in this case just lost that oportunity
e) 3...Qc7 also losing tempos with the queen not my first choice also
f) 3...Nf6 is at the same time a solid choice but also a very fighting one Richard Palliser in His book ""The Bb5 Sicilian"" called this 3...Nf6 the fashionable line due to several recent successful games with it so this will be my choice for this game..."

122,6,4,Bc4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/4b3/4N3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',...and I do the same thing here with my own bishop also eyeing up the pawn on f7. Black's bishop is pinned to that pawn as it is preventing the pawn in front of the king from being isolated.
123,6,5,Nxc4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/2N5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',This *may* not have been such a good trade for me as my knight is probably not in the best position as 9... b5 can harass it although the best square it could retreat to if necessary is e3.
124,6,6,1c3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2N5/2P5/PP1P1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I moved up the pawn in front of my remaining bishop to prevent Black's knight from camping on b4 or d4 and to allow my kingside rook the e1 square without any danger from my rooks being forked.
125,6,7,f6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp3pp/2n2p2/4p3/2N5/2P5/PP1P1PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I was eyeing up Black's king's pawn but he's now covered it. Also my queen's pawn has become backward as 13. d3 would be met with 13... Rxd3 and 13. d4 would result in 13... exd4 and even if I captured Black would take back to take two of my pawns for the price of one.
126,6,8,1Rd1,b'2kr1b1r/ppp4p/2n2pp1/4p3/2N5/1PP5/P2P1PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',I placed my rook behind my pawn so I could trade bishops on a3 without losing my pawn.
127,6,9,1Bh6,b'2kr3r/ppp4p/2n2ppb/4p3/2N5/1PP5/P2P1PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',But as Black got out his bishop from the other side he may be hoping to spring a surprise for me however my pawn is now covered by my rook.

129,6,11,1Rd7,b'2k4r/pppr3p/2n2ppb/4p3/8/1PP5/PN1P1PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',...as Black is obviously trying to increase the pressure on my pawn. He's obviously thinking of doubling on the d-file...
130,6,12,1Raxc1,b'2k4r/pppr3p/2n2pp1/4p3/8/1PPP4/PN3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',...and this bishop trade was probably better for me as it connects my own rooks and allows my queenside one more room to manoeuvre.

133,6,15,1Rcd2,b'2kr4/pppr3p/2n2pp1/8/4p3/1PPP4/PN1R1PPP/3R2K1 b - -',... so I double up behind my pawn to give it some extra cover. I had programmed the following: 19... exd3 20. Rxd3 Rxd3 21. Rxd3 Rxd3 22. Nxd3 to go in for the knight ending...
134,6,16,1f5,b'2kr4/pppr3p/2n3p1/5p2/4p3/1PPP4/PN1R1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',...but with this move Black must be trying to induce more pressure with his knight...

145,6,27,3c4,b'8/p7/3k2pp/1pp2p2/2P2P1P/PP1K4/6P1/8 b - -',...as I felt this move here would allow me to create an outside passed pawn or weaken Black's queenside although 30... b4 would put up more of a fight. I may have played 31. axb4 in reply to that particular move with Black playing 31... cxb4 still giving me that possibility although my king would have to stay near the queenside with 31. a4 leading to a probable draw...
146,6,28,3a4,b'8/8/3k2pp/1pp2p2/P4P1P/1P1K4/6P1/8 b - -',...but this may have been an error of judgement here. Black could play 32... c4+ and then his pawns could round up mine or he'd have an outside passed pawn and allow his king to get nearer to the kingside...
147,6,29,3bxa4,b'8/8/3k2pp/2p2p2/p4P1P/1P1K4/6P1/8 w - -',...but he obviously panicked here.
148,6,30,3bxa4,b'8/8/3k2pp/2p2p2/P4P1P/3K4/6P1/8 b - -',Now we both have an isolated passed queenside pawn but *mine* is on the outside so it can allow my king to get closer to the kingside as Black's would have to go further to eliminate my passed pawn.
149,6,31,3g3,b'8/8/1k4pp/2p2p2/P1K2P1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',This move here allowed me to keep my queenside pawn for one more move.

I also noted that Shamash (who is yet to be beaten on this site) has drawn more games of this flavour than the rest.

My crash course in Caro-Kann informs me that this defence leads toward long games where it can all come down to the integrity of pawn structures. 
317,15,4,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White now must try to defend his advanced pawns. A big drawback to White's pawns is that there are squares in the centre that they can no longer exert control over.

It is currently locked into a relatively useless diagonal. Secondly (and perhaps more importantly) this move is a bid to regain the pawn that was given up and to agressively place his dark square bishop by 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 Bxc5. The resulting position is probably ok for White but doesn't fit in with the strategy I am trying to implement - basically to make it difficult for black to develop his pieces onto good squares and to cramp his position. 
324,15,11,1b4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b2pp/2n1pp2/2PpPn2/1P1B4/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq b3',I played this move to avoid the previously mentioned line and to keep the material advantage for a little longer. Ideas for white may be to follow up with a4 gaining more space and making any Queenside action for black more difficult. An opprtunity may even present itself to exchange with blacks b pawn to create a passed d pawn. A bit of a pipe-dream perhaps! I am expecting Black to respond something like 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 - at least that is what I might consider as black - exchanging pieces to free up a cramped position. 
325,15,12,1a5,b'r2qkb1r/1p1b2pp/2n1pp2/p1PpPn2/1P1B4/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq a6',"I think Black is looking to exchange at b4 in order to take away a defender of d4. 11.a3 doesn't prevent anything (PxP PxP RxR) and 11.bxa5 looks like positional suicide bringing the black rook into the game and creating isolated doubled pawns. 11.b5 seems a good way to proceed forcing Black to either retreat the knight or exchange with White's ""bad"" bishop."

Black must either recapture with gxf or try to mix it up with something like: 11...axb4 but after 12.fxg7 Nxg7 13.Bxg7 Bxg7 14.Be2 black looks quite scattered. Otherwise 11...Ncxd4 12.cxd4 gxf6 13.b5

I seem to be more or less keeping up with development and seem to have a space advantage. The material advantage is an illusion though. I can't see how white can defend d4 after 14...e5

Exchanges on d4 seem to favour White - Black would have a difficult task on his hands trying to defend all of those isolated pawns. There would be a passed pawn of course but I don't think that is enough for Black. However If white doesn't exchange on e5 then Black can play 14...e4 gaining space and forcing the White knight to retreat back to g1. I cannot immediately see any reason why not to take on e5 but I'm sure Shamash wouldn't give me an extra pawn for nothing...

The obvious responses for Black are 14...fxe5 which seems very bland and doesn't achieve anything or maybe 14...Bxc5 which could bring about some complexities including a bishop sacrifice on f2.

So new lesson; if something doesn't work forget about it!

I have always thought that you never should play without a plan. Even more a bad plan is always better than no plan at all. But look out! that plan was already fail and I should have pay attention to the previous rule.
