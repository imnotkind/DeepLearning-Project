0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

GM Cyrano (Afro) asked me to annotate this game and another against his opponent Akjoltoy who needs just one rating point to get to 2700 - wow!  I will give the commentary and hopefully somebody can provide a little deeper analysis so here goes.   Afro opens with 1. e4 and his opponent responds with e6 which is the French Defense."
1,0,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',3. d4 - pretty standard follow up.
2,0,2,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',4. e5.  This pawn advance is often played by white in the French Defense to exert a cramp on black's game.  However black does find some ingenious ways of getting round the cramp!
3,0,3,bxc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',6. bxc3 - B for N trade which busts up white's queenside pawns.
4,0,4,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',6. .... Ne7 - this is the way black usually develops the knight.  It then sometimes goes to g6.
5,0,5,Qg4,b'rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',7. Qg4 - with a black bishop not defending g7 white usually attacks it with his queen to try and provoke a weakness in black's castled position by an impromptu g6.
6,0,6,Qxh7,b'rnbqk1r1/pp2np1Q/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQq -',9. Qxh7 - black has neither played g6 or castled and allowed the WQ to inflict mayhem on his position.  It will be interesting to see what counterplay black has to this.
7,0,7,1Ne2,b'rnb1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQq -',10. Ne2 - Afro develops his knight to this square to prevent a nasty queen check on c3.
8,0,8,dxc3,b'r1b1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/2n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1p5/2P1N1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQq -',11. .... dxc3 - recovers pawn loss and puts a crimp on Afro's queenside.
9,0,9,1Qd3,b'r1b1k1r1/ppq1np2/2n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1pQ4/2P1N1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQq -',12. Qd3 - back comes his queen and now that c3 pawn is starting to look vulnerable.
10,0,10,1Ng3,b'r1b1k1r1/ppq1np2/2n1p3/4P3/3p1P2/P1pQ2N1/2P3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQq -',13. Ng3 - clears the way for Afro's white square bishop to develop.
11,0,11,1Bf3,b'2kr2r1/ppqb1p2/2n5/4Pp2/3p1P2/P1pQ1B2/2P3PP/1RB1K2R b K -',17. Bf3- Afro has still not yet castled.  Instead after a knight trade he elects to improve the position of his lsb.
12,0,12,1Kf2,b'2kr2r1/ppq2p2/2n1b3/4Pp2/3p1P2/P1pQ1B2/2P2KPP/1RB4R b - -',18. Kf2 - hmm with the queens still on he keeps his king in the centre.  Interesting.
13,0,13,2h4,b'2k3r1/pp1r1p2/2n5/3qPp2/3p1P1P/P1pQ2P1/2P2K2/1RB1R3 b - h3',22. h4 - Afro advances his h pawn in order to avoid a rook attack.
14,0,14,2Qa2,b'2k3r1/pp1r1p2/2n5/4Pp2/3p1P1P/P1pQ2P1/q1P2K2/1RB1R3 w - -',22. .... Qa2 - invasion!
15,0,15,2h5,b'2k3r1/p2r1p2/1p6/n3Pp1P/1R1p1P2/P1pQ2P1/q1P2K2/2B1R3 b - -',25. h5 - Afro pushes on his passed pawn but he could be leaving it vulnerable to attack.
16,0,16,Rgd8,b'1k1r4/pn1r1p1P/1p6/4Pp2/1R1p1P2/P1pQ2P1/q1P2K2/2B1R3 w - -',27. ...... Rgd8 - instead of tying his KR down to preventing pawn promotion black elects to double his rooks on the queenside.
17,0,17,2Qxf5,b'1k5r/pn1r1p1P/1p6/4PQ2/2Rp1P2/P1p3P1/q1P2K2/2B1R3 b - -',29. Qxf5 - Black's foremost f pawn drops off and now his rook is en prise.  Afro's passer is now defended by his queen.  Hmm Glenda is often pressed into defending the peonage during my own games!
18,0,18,Qxc4,b'1k1r4/pn3p1Q/1p6/4P3/2qp1P2/P1p3P1/2P2K2/2B1R3 w - -',31. ..... Qxc4 - an interesting trade off and Afro loses his passer.
19,0,19,d3,b'1k1r4/pn3p1Q/1p6/4PP2/2q5/P1pp2P1/2P2K2/2B1R3 w - -',32. ..... d3 and a draw offer.  Hmm at the moment those two advanced black pawns on d3 and c3 are suddenly beginning to look a bit more menacing than Afro's passers.  However I may be missing something.  I hope the Inquest Jury will enlighten me.
20,1,0,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Don´t remember how to play against this one. Is going to be one of those funny chaotic opening games!
21,1,1,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3PN3/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Sorth of an Alejine knight opening here
22,1,2,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3PN3/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I was thinking of 4...Qxd5; 5.d4
23,1,3,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3PN3/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Not just holding the pawn but trying to activate my own pieces
24,1,4,Bc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3PN3/2BPp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Need to do the castling asap I think. I was also planning on delaying it and doing it on the queen´s side but requires too many moves.
25,1,5,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/2pPN3/2BPp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',Didn´t see this. I thought 7...Nbd7 was a good one since there is 8...Nb6 if  change is not accepted; and if so black has a strong attack on the king´s side.
26,1,6,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/2pPN3/2BPp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Knowing that black will activate his rook after cxd but castling seemed to be a priority here.
27,1,7,1f4,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/3PN3/2BQpP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - f3',Only one left I think. N in e5 is centered but fixed also.
28,1,8,1b6,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1p1b1n2/3PN3/2BQpP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Threats Bc5 and also wins a time to develop white B in b7. But I don´t feel like Bb7 is as active as guarding c8-h5. But gaining a time anyways.
29,1,9,1Qd2,b'rn1qr1k1/pb3ppp/1p1b1n2/3PN3/2B1pP2/2N1B3/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b - -',I didn´t feel like giving up my pawn but I thought it was going to be the safest move. Also I found out (After I made the move) that I had a nice attack if Bxd5.
30,1,10,1Bxe5,b'rn1qr1k1/pb3ppp/1p3n2/3Pb3/2B1pP2/2N1B3/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',And there we go
31,1,11,Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/pb3ppp/1p3n2/3P4/2BBp3/2N5/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',In case of 14...e3; 15.Qe2 gives even better chances to white after Bxf6
32,1,12,Nd7,b'r2qr1k1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3P4/2B1p3/2N5/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Best and only one I think. With the idea of Nf8 or Ne5 and then Ng3
33,1,13,1Rf4,b'r2qr1k1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3P4/2B1pR2/2N5/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Threatening Rg4+
34,1,14,1Re5,b'r2q2k1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3Pr3/2B1pR2/2N5/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Didn´t see this one either; as I said I thought there would be a N movement here but seems to work 15.Re5
35,1,15,1Nxe4,b'r2q2k1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3Pr3/2B1NR2/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Again 19.Rg4+ is the threat
36,1,16,1Qf8,b'r4qk1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3Pr3/2B1NR2/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Good one! I spent most of my time here trying to find a good combination but to no avail. I didn´t want to end up with one extra pawn only out of this nice position.
37,1,17,1Rg4+,b'r4qk1/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3Pr3/2B1N1R1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',But maybe there is not much more to do. Now R is not pressing on f6 and the check seems to be a waste.
38,1,18,1Kh8,b'r4q1k/pb1n1p1p/1p3p1Q/3Pr3/2B1N1R1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Queen needs to move and if exchanged I lose even that pawn I didn´t feel it was enough before! Tables have turned for me now. What to do what to do?...
39,1,19,2Qf4,b'r4q1k/pb1n1p1p/1p3p2/3Pr3/2B1NQR1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',So I tried to keep the pressure up and thought about moving 21.Ng4 in case of 20...f5 but it was a complicated situation and did not see it clear.
40,1,20,2Nf6,b'r4q1k/pb1n1p1p/1p3N2/3Prp2/2B2QR1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',But instead did this one. Seems is not as good as the other one
41,1,21,2fxg4,b'r4q1k/pb1n1p1p/1p3N2/3Pr3/2B2Qp1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',The bad one. The great mistake my rival made in this very interesting game (from our amateur level point of view ofc)
42,1,22,2Nxd7,b'r4q1k/pb1N1p1p/1p6/3Pr3/2B2Qp1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Now R in e5 is lost. 1-0
43,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hey hey all. Another d4 opener that i desperately hate. but this game i took advice from one of you who annotated my last game and had a much more easier and enjoyable game.
44,2,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',i stick with the e6 that i like to open with 
45,2,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',and once again im faced with d4.  last time i had tried c5 and it gave a weird game. i was suggested to play d5 and decided to give it a try I already find myself in uncharted territory on move 2 but we will deal with the flow and see what happens
46,2,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',my opponent pushes by. I dont know why i thought he would go exd5 and open up the board. but pushing by makes me feel like this opponent is more experienced. i decide to check his profile out and his 22-10 damn good starting record i have to watch myself this game it seems!
47,2,4,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',i dont know if this is a good reply but it felt right to maybe undermine his middle pawn and deploy my DSB if he takes
48,2,5,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',he decides to take his LSB out with a check i will just reply by saying 
49,2,6,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',lets take our LSB's off the board!
50,2,7,Bxd7+,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1B1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',and he accepts
51,2,8,Qxd7,b'rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',felt like retaking with the queen was more appropriate i wanted my knight on c6 having already played c5
52,2,9,c3,b'rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',hmm unanticipated reply. i like these kinds of games not too aggressive. Some set up for a nice mid game with some thought. Instead of straight forward swap outs with the most aggressive replies.
53,2,10,Nc6,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',decide to finally develop a piece. one of us has too! and he doesnt bite on letting my DSB out
54,2,11,Be3,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',after he played this i realised that our LSB's are off the board and pushing my pawn forward seems so much stronger than doing some exchanges in the middle.  if he tries some queen side pushing i can just set up on a6 and b5 and have entire pawns on white squares.
55,2,12,c4,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',and so i decide to go for a control of the white squares. since all his pawns are on dark squares i thought it greatly added value to my bishop over his and would allow ten times more mobility
56,2,13,Nf3,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',he further develops planning for a king side castle i can see. i decide im going to queen side castle at this stage and just move my pawns up left side of the board and see what develops
57,2,14,h6,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',i play this as to restrain his knight and bishop my castle can wait 1 more turn he cannot interupt it immediately
58,2,15,h3,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',hmmm this reply i thought to be curious and made me think he wouldnt king side castle. I thought he was trying to formulate some sort of counter play king side. i saw it as a non threat as im going to be pushing that side. Especially since i was planning to go ne7 not nf6 so the pawn wouldnt help against my knight
59,2,16,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R w KQ -',queen side castle!
60,2,17,1O-O,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',im surprised he still decided to king side castle after playing h3 but this really delighted me
61,2,18,1f5,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q2p1/2n1p2p/3pPp2/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - f6',i tempted him with an en passant instead of f6   i thought he wouldnt take and it goes with my plan of having all pawns on white squares. and to help push the g pawn
62,2,19,1Nbd2,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q2p1/2n1p2p/3pPp2/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',hmm i really liked this move hes giving very little breathing room to his knight on the f3 square and i will be coming up to pressure him
63,2,20,1g5,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q4/2n1p2p/3pPpp1/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - g6',more pawn development. i dont know if all these pawns are weakening but they seemed to the point having a good developed game.  yes my DSB and Gknight are still unmoved but are well aligned with the fray and my bishop cant really go anywhere right side except e7 but i was saving that square for my knight.
64,2,21,1Nb1,b'2kr1bnr/pp1q4/2n1p2p/3pPpp1/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',after this reply it made me realise he thought i was going for his DSB lol silly me i wasnt even looking for that and i mightve missed it i was heading for g4 lol but then i could count it as a time gain for what i was going for and saw an oppurtunity to get my dsb in play for some type of swindle
65,2,22,1Be7,b'2kr2nr/pp1qb3/2n1p2p/3pPpp1/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',so i temporarily take my knights e7 square
66,2,23,1b3,b'2kr2nr/pp1qb3/2n1p2p/3pPpp1/2pP4/1PP1BN1P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',oh wow unanticipated time gain i calculated my things a second time and it looked like a go witout having to reply to that
67,2,24,1g4,b'2kr2nr/pp1qb3/2n1p2p/3pPp2/2pP2p1/1PP1BN1P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',g4! let the games begin
68,2,25,1Ne1,b'2kr2nr/pp1qb3/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP2p1/1PP1B3/P4PP1/RN1QNRK1 b - -',ooo not the d or H files what a surprise.  at this stage of the game i didnt see it serves better to protect the g2 square though
69,2,26,1Bg5,b'2kr2nr/pp1q4/2n1p2p/3pP1b1/2pP2p1/1PP1B3/P4PP1/RN1QNRK1 w - -',i saw that this would leave some hanging pawns that i would hope he would start eating as time gainers but i also saw it as the only way to connect my rooks with an open board to his king in a quick pace. 
70,2,27,1Bxg5,b'2kr2nr/pp1q4/2n1p2p/3pP1B1/2pP2p1/1PP5/P4PP1/RN1QNRK1 b - -',and so he takes!
71,2,28,1Qxg4,b'2kr2nr/pp1q4/2n1p3/3pP1p1/2pP2Q1/1PP5/P4PP1/RN2NRK1 b - -',chomp chomp 1 pawn down will he eat more!
72,2,29,1f3,b'2kr2nr/pp5q/2n1p3/3pP1p1/2pP2Q1/1PP2P2/P5P1/RN2NRK1 b - -',ooo sees the threat coming will it be enough though!
73,2,30,1Nge7,b'2kr3r/pp2n2q/2n1p3/3pP1p1/2pP2Q1/1PP2P2/P5P1/RN2NRK1 w - -',ne7 hahaha! it was never nf6 buddy! nor was it ever going to be Qh1+ without having the knight on f5
74,2,31,1Qxe6+,b'2kr3r/pp2n2q/2n1Q3/3pP1p1/2pP4/1PP2P2/P5P1/RN2NRK1 b - -',ouch wtf! i thought he was going to go Qxg5. i had more hanging pawns than i thought hmm lets see what he does on his time gain
75,2,32,1Kb8,b'1k1r3r/pp2n2q/2n1Q3/3pP1p1/2pP4/1PP2P2/P5P1/RN2NRK1 w - -',scoot scoot

77,2,34,2Nf5,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/2n1Q3/3pPnp1/2pP4/1PP2P2/P4KP1/RN2NR2 w - -',boom! look at that Minefield his queen finds himself in lol! his Qxe6 really surprised me but now i knew he wouldnt move his queen and all i needed to do was to kick his king to e2 with Qh4 check  my opponent left for the night. i tried to anticipate his moves. the only one that saves his queen is nc2 but then he loses the cover he has on the g2 square. i dont know what his best reply was.  i was looking maybe hes going to go bxc4 or nd2 is what i thought the most
78,2,35,2Ke2,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/2n1Q3/3pPnp1/2pP4/1PP2P2/P3K1P1/RN2NR2 b - -',WHAT!!!!!!!!!!! a dream come true unanticpated SURPRISE not reply but i think this fork was really veiled cause of that pawn line. and its right smack in the middle off it
79,2,36,2Ncxd4+,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/4Q3/3pPnp1/2pn4/1PP2P2/P3K1P1/RN2NR2 w - -',my opponent never saw this coming or that king wouldve never went to e2
80,2,37,2cxd4,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/4Q3/3pPnp1/2pP4/1P3P2/P3K1P1/RN2NR2 b - -',the only small compensation he will get for his Q and 2 pawns ouch  i got my 2 pawns back i guess! knight for queen
81,2,38,2Nc3,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/4n3/3pP1p1/2p5/1PN2P2/P2K2P1/R3NR2 b - -',hes now trying to reconnect his rooks. i respected my opponent for staying many times when an opponents queen finds itself forked. pun intended >< the resignation soon follows
82,2,39,2Nd4,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/8/3pP1p1/2pn4/1PN2P2/P2K2P1/R3NR2 w - -',i decide to bring my knight back into action since he hadnt played nc2
83,2,40,2Nc2,b'1k1r3r/pp5q/8/3pP1p1/2pn4/1PN2P2/P1NK2P1/R4R2 b - -',oops this was another blunder. i think my opponent was discombobulated after his queen had fallen but this made it Mate in 6. i created a puzzle from this position ><
84,2,41,2Qxc2+,b'1k1r3r/pp6/8/3pP1p1/2pn4/1PN2P2/P1qK2P1/R4R2 w - -',not much he can do his second knight drops and hes can move 5 more times all to checks into a checkmate my opponent resigned after this move.    maybe he also had lost sight of my queens angle trying to focus mid board and on his rooks. i hope you enjoyed the development i had and nice little end game trap in the pawn line as for me another 60/30 opponent beaten. but i have lost 4-5 in the passed few days stagnating around 1500 elo for a week. i hope i dont do many more blunders.

118,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello those who like to follow annotated games I'm hoping to get good comments on this one.
119,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',in my passed annotations i started at 1350 elo and ive been steadily climbing with some bumps here and there and as i climb i always like facing tougher opponents.  this is my third opponent in the 1700 range since my return and this also happens to be a revenge match in a tourny we are playing together
120,4,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',my classic LSB exit  This was our 2nd game where i lost the first after playing 43 moves even and then just straight out blundering to lose
121,4,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',the nf6 i face most often
122,4,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',previously i went d3 here but i had annotated i prefer to go nc3 when the opponent goes nc6 and we will get to see why i told myself im coming out hard vs this guy and making it a pawn war and i will not be looking for a checkmate early unless some blunderous option appears.
123,4,5,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',and like i previously noted ive learnt the blacks like to park their DSB on c5 so i dont need to do a2 that i love to do lol
124,4,6,Nge2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',and my response to this is ne2 with a quick d4 depending on what my opponent plays next
125,4,7,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',oppurtunity appears for d4 i love it
126,4,8,Bxd4,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/4p3/2BbP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',curiously he decides to swap out his DSB this is the scenario i prefer when i play d4
127,4,9,Nxd4,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/4p3/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',natural replies ensue
128,4,10,Bb7,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',i saw the fianchetto coming this delighted me cause some nice antics are coming
129,4,11,e5,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/4P3/2BQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',if he retreats back to the backline he delays his castling  and its what i sometimes expect. when they go to h5 is when i love it
130,4,12,Nh5,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4P2n/2BQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',he went to h5 perfect!
131,4,13,Qg4,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4P2n/2B3Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',force the pawn development and then i can develop my DSB
132,4,14,1Bg5,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1p1p/1p4p1/4P1Bn/2B3Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',attack on the queen unless he wants to lose pieces he has to move her to c8
133,4,15,1Bh6,b'rnq1k2r/pbpp1p1p/1p4pB/4P2n/2B3Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',and i prevent his castling getting ready to castle myself i was maybe looking to queen side castle  i like the set up i have at the moment and hence why i like to play d4 if allowed over d3 early on it can offer many antics and a fun game but this is far from over my opponent will not lie down and just surrender politely
134,4,16,1Nc6,b'r1q1k2r/pbpp1p1p/1pn3pB/4P2n/2B3Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',"unexpected reply sorta even if he doesnt really have many other choices. but i didnt think he would block his LSB

135,4,17,Ne7,b'r1q1k2r/pbppnp1p/1p4pB/4P2n/2B1Q3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',i can see hes heading for my DSB i see this as a opening to get a pawn up high and disrupt his castle still if he goes as planned
136,4,18,1Nd5,b'r1q1k2r/pbppnp1p/1p4pB/3NP2n/2B1Q3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',cant let my queen die and i have to hold on to my LSB longer than my knight if he decides to swap out his LSB

140,4,22,c6,b'r1q4r/pb1pkp1p/1pp2Np1/3BPn1P/4Q3/8/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',he didnt want to swap out with my queen so high with a knight and pawn close to his king
141,4,23,1Bb3,b'r1q4r/pb1pkp1p/1pp2Np1/4Pn1P/4Q3/1B6/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',i didnt want him to possibly expand another pawn to b5 and it costing me another bishop move so i thought moving him here was wiser
142,4,24,1b5,b'r1q4r/pb1pkp1p/2p2Np1/1p2Pn1P/4Q3/1B6/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',ah ha! the b5!

144,4,26,1Rd8,b'r1qr4/pb1pkp1p/2p2Np1/1p2Pn1P/4Q3/1B6/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',hes playing highly defensively i loves this move and saw it as an oppurtunity to grab a pawn
145,4,27,c5,b'r1qr4/pb1pkp1N/6p1/1pp1Pn1P/4Q3/1B6/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',he decides to try to budge my queen i will offer lsb exchange to maintain a high guard lol
146,4,28,Rb8,b'1rqr4/pb1pkp1N/6p1/1ppBPn1P/4Q3/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',hes forced to reinforce the lsb or swap them out he opted to reinforce it
147,4,29,2h6,b'1rqr4/pb1pkp1N/6pP/1ppBPn2/4Q3/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',here i decided to pass my pawn it was safe if he takes it with knight i queen check on h4 and he would find himself in a difficult position
148,4,30,2Bxd5,b'1rqr4/p2pkp1N/6pP/1ppbPn2/4Q3/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',he finally decides to swap out LSB's i guess it was to relieve pressure
149,4,31,2Qxd5,b'1rqr4/p2pkp1N/6pP/1ppQPn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',here if he takes my pawn with his knight i believe its checkmate with 23... nxh6 24 Qd6+ ke8 24 Qf8# i guess my opponent considered this and tried to see if i would trade out queens or possibly push mine away.
150,4,32,2Qc6,b'1r1r4/p2pkp1N/2q3pP/1ppQPn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',this delighted me i needed my queen do be on a dark square. and to keep covering that pawn now on h6
151,4,33,2Qd2,b'1r1r4/p2pkp1N/2q3pP/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R b - -',i think this reply really froze my opponent cause of the possible queen check on g5
152,4,34,2Ke8,b'1r1rk3/p2p1p1N/2q3pP/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R w - -',this move i think he did to try to relieve stress but it delighted me cause it was either wasted time and i could move my pawn higher and maybe he will make a mistake and block it off with his king 
153,4,35,2Nf6+,b'1r1rk3/p2p1p2/2q2NpP/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R b - -',get the check 
154,4,36,2Ke7,b'1r1r4/p2pkp2/2q2NpP/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R w - -',he comes back to his previous state
155,4,37,2h7,b'1r1r4/p2pkp1P/2q2Np1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R b - -',and now its getting dangerous for him. i can definately count one of his rooks as pinned behind that pawn for a while i have to start looking for simplification to head into end game.
156,4,38,2Rdh8,b'1r5r/p2pkp1P/2q2Np1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPPQ1P1P/2KR3R w - -',"and he seals that rooks fate for a while. but looking at the board and the fact i control the open lanes i can see i will be able to get a queen but it will be difficult.
"
157,4,39,2Qxd7+,b'1r5r/p2Qkp1P/2q2Np1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',my opponent went on vacation as i played this move looking to simplify into end game.  i think there were some nice lines to be played if i took with the knight though (i analysed during the week he was away lol). i did not want to give me opponent time to recover though. i felt i had been controlling tempo all game long and wanted to keep doing so
158,4,40,2Qxd7,b'1r5r/p2qkp1P/5Np1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',forced to swap out queens. i looked to retake with the rook but then i looked farther down the line and if i want to be able to queen safely i have to bring my king over to the right side of my D file rook so double stacking now would not be wise cause of that knight could come down and be very dangerous. 
159,4,41,2Nxd7,b'1r5r/p2Nkp1P/6p1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',i decided to take with knight to force him to play his rook or i was hoping he would take my pawn lol in a rook sacrifice 
160,4,42,2Rbc8,b'2r4r/p2Nkp1P/6p1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',hmm un anticipated reply. i thought he would go to d8
161,4,43,2Nf6,b'2r4r/p3kp1P/5Np1/1pp1Pn2/8/8/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',have to reprotect my pawn
162,4,44,3f4,b'2r4r/p4p1P/4kNp1/1pp1Pn2/5P2/8/PPP4P/2KR3R b - f3',reinforce with pawn because i do not want to pin one of my rooks behind the e pawn  and since i didnt send my rook to d7 earlier i can still prevent his knight from coming down and place himself in a good position
163,4,45,3a5,b'2r4r/5p1P/4kNp1/ppp1Pn2/5P2/8/PPP4P/2KR3R w - a6',he decides to start crunching my king. i forsaw this and hence why i need to get my king to the other side
164,4,46,3Rd7,b'2r4r/3R1p1P/4kNp1/ppp1Pn2/5P2/8/PPP4P/2K4R b - -',decide to block off the path so my king can pass. if he offers his rook ill trade out and get kicked to the other side on his recapture
165,4,47,3Re1,b'2r4r/3R1p1P/4kNp1/ppp1P3/3n1P2/8/PPP4P/2K1R3 b - -',i dont want him to take my f pawn and if he goes to f3 i can double stack

167,4,49,3Kd2,b'2r4r/3R1p1P/4kNp1/1pp1Pn2/p4P2/2P5/PP1K3P/4R3 b - -',time to pass my king now im controlling all the exits to his knight too. this game had been very thoughtful. my opponent would play 1-3 moves max a day i had to keep staying atleast 5-8 moves ahead
168,4,50,3Rcd8,b'3r3r/3R1p1P/4kNp1/1pp1Pn2/p4P2/2P5/PP1K3P/4R3 w - -',he offers the anticipated rook exchange

170,4,52,3Rh8,b'7r/5p1P/4kNp1/1pp1Pn2/p4P2/2P5/PP2K2P/4R3 w - -',hes forced to back to h8 or else i play ng8 and he cant prevent queen
171,4,53,3Rd1,b'7r/5p1P/4kNp1/1pp1Pn2/p4P2/2P5/PP2K2P/3R4 b - -',i had seen i could get my queen when we still both had our queens i could see it would be an even trade in material but i would rather have a queen vs a rook and knight end game and focus moving only 2 pieces queen and king
172,4,54,3b4,b'7r/5p1P/4kNp1/2p1Pn2/pp3P2/2P5/PP2K2P/3R4 w - -',hmmm im curious if he thinks i will take. id rather he take c3 and i recapture blocking off both his pawns or that he moves forward and i play a3 in reply. since i plan on getting a queen id rather not let any of his pawns have a chance to pass.
173,4,55,3Rd8,b'3R3r/5p1P/4kNp1/2p1Pn2/pp3P2/2P5/PP2K2P/8 b - -',force to exchanges to get my queen

175,4,57,Nxg8,b'3r2nQ/5p2/4k1p1/2p1P3/pp3P2/2P5/PP2K2P/8 w - -',cant obviously do a check on f6 he recaptures with knight
176,4,58,4c4,b'3r2n1/4kp2/6p1/2p1P3/ppP2P2/7Q/PP2K2P/8 b - -',and deny the passing for the pawns I thought this choke point would make it alot harder for his rook to get by
177,4,59,4Kf8,b'3r1kn1/5p2/6p1/2p1P3/ppP2P2/7Q/PP2K2P/8 w - -',he has to gain space to get his knight back into play. i plan on getting my queen back over the pawn line

183,4,65,4Kf3,b'4rk2/5p2/6p1/2p1Pn2/QpP2P2/5K2/PP5P/8 b - -',decided to try to get my king to the right side as a time controller. i have to be careful if i go after his d5 pawn or when i attack with a3 and he replies with b3 i can see hes setting up a fork on d4 with his knight when my queen would be on b3 after taking his pawn
184,4,66,4Rd8,b'3r1k2/5p2/6p1/2p1Pn2/QpP2P2/5K2/PP5P/8 w - -',here i saw i have a dangerous checkmate on myself if im not careful with my king and place him too high like the g4 square

190,4,72,5Nd4,b'2r2k2/5p2/6p1/Q1p1P3/2Pn1P2/Pp6/1P3K1P/8 w - -',gets his knight closer to the action and defends his b pawn

194,4,76,5Ke8,b'4k3/1Q3p2/2r3p1/2p1P3/2Pn1P2/Pp6/1P3K1P/8 w - -',he doesnt have many choices of moves at this stage. hes congested his knight into protecting his rook and pawn so that piece is now sleeping 
195,4,77,5Kg3,b'4k3/1Q3p2/2r3p1/2p1P3/2Pn1P2/Pp4K1/1P5P/8 b - -',i decided to bring his king back or else my king will be able to eat his pawns

200,4,82,Ne7,b'8/4npk1/4r1p1/2Q1P3/2P2PK1/8/1P5P/8 w - -',now i was proud with myself this looked almost in the bag but not time to blunder like last game
201,4,83,6b4,b'8/4npk1/4r1p1/2Q1P3/1PP2PK1/8/7P/8 b - b3',off to the races!
202,4,84,6Nf5,b'8/5pk1/4r1p1/2Q1Pn2/1PP2PK1/8/7P/8 w - -',i looked at the e3 check my queen was safe so was my e pawn if i dont move my queen
203,4,85,Nh6+,b'8/5pk1/4r1pn/1PQ1P3/2P2PK1/8/7P/8 w - -',hmm unanticipated reply this is ok. he brought his knight away and i can just focus left side now
204,4,86,6Kh3,b'8/5pk1/4r1pn/1PQ1P3/2P2P2/7K/7P/8 b - -',so i decide to place my king in a place where he cant check him with his knight again
205,4,87,6Ng8,b'6n1/5pk1/4r1p1/1PQ1P3/2P2P2/7K/7P/8 w - -',after this reply i took a long time to calculate something.  and after playing what i think every possible play through due to his knight and kings position i thought this next move to be epic!
206,4,88,6Qd6,b'6n1/5pk1/3Qr1p1/1P2P3/2P2P2/7K/7P/8 b - -',bam! if he takes my queen with his rook he cannot stop me from re queening.   my opponent played 1-3 moves a day with easily 1 hour to 5 hours Minimum between each move although here he played within 3 minutes of me playing this
207,4,89,6Rxd6,b'6n1/5pk1/3r2p1/1P2P3/2P2P2/7K/7P/8 w - -',"i was like wow the only move i dont think he thought through of the entire game was the winning one

was this a real sacrifice this time Ion? hehe"
208,4,90,Nf6,b'8/5pk1/3P1np1/1P6/2P2P2/7K/7P/8 w - -',he plays the next 2-3 moves still i told him i think i calculated my queen sacrifice properly
209,4,91,6c5,b'8/5pk1/3P1np1/1PP5/5P2/7K/7P/8 b - -',there is a very important order to the pawn movements here. it would take forever to type it all out its fun to explore to see if you can queen as black and prevent it as white.
210,4,92,6b6,b'4k3/5p2/1PPP1np1/8/5P2/7K/7P/8 b - -',"and after this state of game my opponent realised it was impossible for him to prevent queen and resigned.

this had been a great revenge match to make it 1-1 in the tournament and i hope you all enjoyed the game. all Comments appreciated!"
211,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I recommend to the club that we play 1. e4 due to the fact that Ispissimus is a very strong D-pawn player. 
212,5,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a surprise as I and the club were expecting 1. ...c5 or 1. ...e5. This move says that Ipsissimus is wanting to take an indirect approach to the game. While at the same time keeping his over all plan close to the chest. 
213,5,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Naturally white responds by staking a claim in the centre. 
214,5,3,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Develops a Knight and defends the d4 pawn. Also the knight challenges the the black DSB for control of the central dark squares. 
215,5,4,d6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black adopts the pric defense which is not a recommended system in top play. In my opinion it is way to passive and black ends up defending the whole game. 
216,5,5,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White on the other hand continues to develop naturally. Plus now white has a slight advantage due to his better centre lead in development and slight edge in tempo. 
217,5,6,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2pp2p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Though black has wasted two tempo on pawn moves his structure is rock solid and should repel any attack by white. Even though black has nothing offensively going on his defensive capabilities make up the difference. Such is the nature of the pirc defense all defense and no offence. 
218,5,7,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2pp2p1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The alternative is Be2 but the club choose this move because it hits at f7 and put the bishop on the powerful a2-g8 diagonal. On this diagonal this bishop seriously hinders black ability to free himself. I suggest that you mark this move and watch throughout the remainder of the game how this bishop continues to grow more and more powerful as the game goes on. The fact that this bishop is allowed to stay on this diagonal for so long is one of the reasons why white wins.  
219,5,8,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black has to start think about his development while at the same time keeping white's centre in check. The tactical point of Nf6 is that now black threatens ...d5 gaining back a valuable tempo from white's LSB. Which incidentally highlights the main drawback of playing bc4. That is the White LSB can easily be attack via ...b7-b5 and ...d5.  
220,5,9,Bb3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White simply side steps any business that may come with ...d5 or ...b5. 
221,5,10,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',both sides take time out to take care of king safety. At this point white's main strategical plan is to play e4-e5 with a serious wedge into the black camp. 
222,5,11,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PP1b1/1BN2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I believe black main alternative is 7...d5 but that allows e4-e5 which gives white an long term advantage of space. With 7. ...Bg4 black directly deals with the threat of e4-e5 by eliminating the main catalyst of the e4-e5 push which is the F-Knight. However black gives white the long term strategic advantage of the bishop pair. Which in the end is why white wins. 
223,5,12,e6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/2pppnp1/8/3PP3/1BN2Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black is quite content to sit back behind his wall of pawns and taunt white to come and get him. 
224,5,13,1Rd1,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/2pppnp1/8/3PP3/1BN2Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',with the prospect of e4-e5 gone for at least the short term white shifts their focus to opening up the d-file. 
225,5,14,1Bf4,b'rn3rk1/ppq2pbp/2pppnp1/8/3PPB2/1BN2Q1P/PPP2PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',A strong square for the bishop that prevents black from freeing himself with ...e6-e5. While at the same time x-raying the black queen on c7. In the short term the club's plan was to constrain black as much as possible to deny him the ability to free himself. By denying black his ability to counterattack this would force him to eventually take drastic measures to get something going. However as long as black continues to hide behind his wall of pawns there is not much white can do in the end. So all white can hope for is that black over extends or gets impatient. This is what makes systems like the pirc so hard to play because no one likes the feeling of being squeezed to death. 
226,5,15,1a4,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pbp/2pppnp1/8/P2PPB2/1BN2Q1P/1PP2PP1/R2R2K1 b - a3',preventing black from freeing himself with ...b7-b5. Now the only counter play that black has is Nh5 attacking the bishop on f4. 
227,5,16,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pbp/2ppp1p1/7n/P2PPB2/1BN2Q1P/1PP2PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',As expected
228,5,17,1Be3,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pbp/2ppp1p1/7n/P2PP3/1BN1BQ1P/1PP2PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',A good sided minority of our club preferred Bh2 keeping the bishop on the diagonal. However I vetoed that because the weakness on d4 must be taken seriously. Futhermore I also foresaw that the bishop would return to the f4 diagonal with a vengeance in the near future. I also feared that the bishop may end up blocked in at h2 or worse still getting traded off the board Be3 avoids this possible trade. 
229,5,18,1g4,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p1ppp1p1/7n/P2PP1P1/1BN1BQ1P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 b - g3',The first serious concession by white which signals that is it is time to get it on. White has done absolutely everything they could to prepare and now is the time to push black off the board. 
230,5,19,1a5,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p1pppnp1/P7/3PP1P1/1BN1BQ1P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 b - -',preventing b7-b5 and forcing black into a pure passive position for the rest of the game. The club from here on out adopts a python like style which means slowly squeezed black to death 
231,5,20,1c5,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/P1p5/3PP1P1/1BN1BQ1P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 w - -',!? I have to be honest when I first say this move my heart skipped a beat. It is also the main reason why I played Be3 instead of Bh2. Now with the bishop on e3 d4 is securely defended. White can now make the principled response which is every wing attack should be countered in the center. Mark this move as I think it is where black starts to go down hill fast. 
232,5,21,1e5,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/P1p1P3/3P2P1/1BN1BQ1P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 b - -',! I have to give this an exclamation mark because it does so many things like open the centre which unleashes the bisho pair plus open the d-file for the rook on d1 which has been sitting there patiently since move 10. 
233,5,22,Qc8,b'2qr1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2Q2p1/P1p1p3/6P1/1B2B2P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 w - -',After a flurry of exchanges white comes out on top. Though down a pawn white has flying bishops control of the d-file and active pieces. Black is reduced to defense. 
234,5,23,Nb8,b'1nqr1rk1/1p3pbp/p2Q2p1/P1p1p3/B5P1/4B2P/1PP2P2/R2R2K1 w - -',forced

The point of ...Qe6 is to improve teh queen position and temporarily prevent the powerful Bb3.  However the main alternative 23...Kh8 trying to side step the nasty pin on f7 fails to 24. Rxd8 Rxd8 25. Bb3!
238,5,27,2Qb6,b'3r1rk1/1p3pbp/pQn1q1p1/P3p3/B5P1/2P1B2P/1P3P2/R2R2K1 b - -',Threatening to take the b-pawn so Black has to move his queen back to the bad c8 square and allow white to play the powerful Bb3
239,5,28,Bf6,b'2qr1rk1/1p3p1p/pQn2bp1/P3p3/6P1/1BP1B2P/1P3P2/R2R2K1 w - -',Black is trying to re-energize the DSB but I think I would have played ...h5 here to just sit on my hands is not my style so I would opt to put some pressure on white. When you put pressure on your opponent you never know what can happen. 
240,5,29,Kg7,b'2qr4/1p3pkp/pQn2bp1/P2Bp3/6P1/2P1B2P/1P3PK1/3R4 w - -',This I believe is the first real difficult choice for white. As I believe the path toward progress in not truly clear. 29. B4 may at first glance look like a good move but it has the nasty drawback of weakening c3 which if black can find find away to play e4 is suddenly under attack. 
241,5,30,h5,b'2qr4/1p3pk1/pQn2bp1/P2Bp2p/1P4P1/2P1B2P/5PK1/3R4 w - h6',A great move that rips white king position open like a can opener
242,5,31,e4,b'2qr4/1p3pk1/pQn2bp1/P2B3P/1P2p3/2P1B2P/5PK1/3R4 w - -',This is the main drawback of 29.b4. I feared that black would be able to gain much needed counter play by attacking c3. 
243,5,32,3Bb3,b'2qr4/1p3pk1/pQn2bp1/P6P/1P2p3/1BP1B2P/5PK1/3R4 b - -',A more defensive move than anything else. White's most pressing problem is un coordinated pieces. 
244,5,33,3Qf5,b'3r4/1p3pk1/pQn2bp1/P4q1P/1P2p3/1BP1B2P/5PK1/3R4 w - -',?! This I believe is the final nail in the coffin. During the game I was a little concerned (most of the club did not share my concern) about 31....Rxd1 32. Bxd1 Bxc3! 33. hxg6 fxg6 34. Bc2 Bxb4 and I think after a hard long look white can only manage a draw. The reason being is that most of white's trumps were in the queen side majority and bishop pair. Now after 35. Bxe4 Bc3 black has mostly freed himself of most of his weaknesses and can easily defend against attacks. However what I do not like about 31. ...Qf5 is that it allows white to retain the bishop pair and the queen pawn majority. The short falls of this move are eloquently highlighted in the rest of this game. 
245,5,34,Qxg6+,b'3n4/1p3pk1/pQ3bq1/P7/1P2p3/1BP1B2P/5PK1/8 w - -',What makes this position winning for white is the fact that the white king can seek shelter on the queen side and black does not have time to capture the critical c3-pawn. 
246,5,35,3Qc7,b'3n4/1pQ2pk1/p4b2/P4q2/1P2p3/1BP1B2P/5P2/5K2 b - -',!! winning move. The club rightly assessed that black only has spite checks 
247,5,36,Ne6,b'8/1pQ2pk1/p3nb2/P7/1P2p3/1BP1B2q/4KP2/8 w - -',Black defends valiantly by centralizing his pieces. 
248,5,37,3Qxb7,b'8/1Q3pk1/p3nb2/P7/1P2p3/1BP1B2q/4KP2/8 b - -',The pawn advantage is retained and now it is impossible for black to hold back the upcoming pawn storm 
249,5,38,3Qf3+,b'8/1Q3pk1/p3nb2/P7/1P2p3/1BP1Bq2/4KP2/8 w - -',black has a last gasp attempt for a repetitive draw with the queen 
250,5,39,3Kd2,b'8/1Q3pk1/p3nb2/P7/1P2p3/1BP1Bq2/3K1P2/8 b - -',only move c3 has to be defended

253,5,42,4Kb2,b'8/1Q3pk1/p3B3/P7/1P2p3/2Pq4/1K6/8 b - -',White king seeks refuge on the queen side. It is worth noting that had black played the 31...Rxd1 line white would not have had this possibility of hiding behind the pawns. Also black would have retained his knight and bishop making it almost impossible for white to win. In conclusion White managed to nurse a small but enduring space advantage for a win. Over the course of the game white added the bishop pair and central dominance to force black to concede more time and space. The biggest take away for me is that the pirc defense is a solid defense but black is often left with no attacking resources. It is my opinion that black's final chance to draw the game came at move 31. where he should have played 31...Rxd1 leading to the capturing of the c3 and b4 pawns. This coupled with the retention of the Knight and Black bishop would have been enough to secure the draw.

Id appreciate all comments where i could have replied better. although this was a win i played Crunched the entire game it was scary!

283,6,29,2Bg5,b'rnb2rk1/3p2p1/p2Pp2p/2P3b1/7N/8/4B1PP/RN3R1K w - -',i also judged that i cannot let the D pawn get to e7. this is in forsight to also play nc6.  he is forced to swap out rooks here i got a checkmate looming or if he develops his knight i would swap out the rooks myself anway. i think he took it upon himself to reposition my king
284,6,30,Kf7,b'rnb5/3p1kp1/p2Pp1Np/2P3b1/8/8/4B1PP/RN5K w - -',i didnt have time to do nc6 so i need double couverage on e7 still

It's a move that has been played for centuries by all levels of opponents and even Bobby Fisher's personal favorite. ""Best by test"" as he'd say it. A move befitting for a challenge match I'd say."
314,7,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I decide to play the Sicilian my bread and butter and a countermeasure to my abysmal 1. e4 e5 play. White has a lot of options but usually goes with the quiet Nf3 before making fireworks with a d4 push in the center. I was kind of hoping for him to play 2.c3 which is the Alapin. I was hoping for this because it's arguably one of the openings I play worst against and It'd make a good practicegame.
315,7,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Interestingly enough my opponent chooses for the Smith Morra gambit an opening which one of my old teachers in high school used to play. White sacrifices a pawn ( sometimes temporarily depending on what variation you decide to play ) in exchange for a faster development.
316,7,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I was anticipating c3 to follow now as it's usually played in this position. I would probably have played some type of Scheveningen setup if that were the case with pawns on d6 and e6.
317,7,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',c3 doesn't get played. This is perfectly playable for white in my opinion even though the openingdatabases seem to disagree. It'll most likely transpose into an open sicilian.
318,7,5,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',We successfully transposed into an open Sicilian.
319,7,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is not what I usually play but I felt like testing it out. Usually I'd play e6 and go into a Taimanov/Kahn Sicilian where I lie in wait for counterattacking possibilities. The variation which I hoped we'd end up playing is called the Sveshnikov Sicilian which is usually reached with the move order: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5! I wanted to play this Sicilian since it's one of the most dynamic Sicilians out there where black creates a bunch of weaknesses in his position in exchange for dynamic counterplay and if white doesn't know what he's doing he can get caught off guard really easily. I figured it'd make for an interesting and fun match full of tactical complications.
320,7,7,Nxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2N2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Sadly we're not going into the Sveshnikov. I think this move is an error by white and I'm not sure why he played it. Maybe he was looking at 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5 but that gets met by Qa5+ simply winning a pawn. I'd have played Nc3 instead if I were white in this position.
321,7,8,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Winning back my knight. dxc6 was also an option but black loses his right to castle after the queens go off the board. The pawn on e4 is now under attack so he must play either f3 Nc3 Bd2 or a queenmove.I think Nc3 is the better one out of all those options. 
322,7,9,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A scheveningen type of set-up. I don't think it's black's best move but I don't think it's a mistake either. It makes the development of my dark squared bishop a little bit iffy but gives room for my light squared bishop to come and play. I'm planning on developing the dark squared bishop with a fianchetto.
323,7,10,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',The bishop is developed as planned. I start to wonder where I'm going to move my light squared bishop to. Maybe b7 would be nice after a c5 push but I think that a c5 push is too early at this point of the game. The e6 square isn't really appetizing either as it doesn't put pressure on anything. It's something I'll have to think about during the next few moves. Right now castling should be my priority.
324,7,11,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I found this interesting. It's not everyday that both bishops get developed on the 3th rank. I don't think it's bad but it might miss a bit of ... ambition? It doesn't really put a lot of pressure on anything aside from the a7 pawn but if his response to me moving my rook to b8 is Bxa7 then I don't think this game will go well for him at all. Both sides can develop very calmly here and there's no opening advantage for either side. Ng4 comes into mind making use of my underdeveloped bishop for protection. It's not something that is worth it right now but definitely something to consider in the future. I personally would have played Bg5. h6 would be met with Bh4. If black still wants to chase the bishop away with g5 after that then he effectively ruined his kingside pawnstructure making castling rather awkward. 
325,7,12,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I am not sure why Qe2 was played. If I had to take a guess then I'd say it was either played with the hopes of playing Ba6 which isn't very good since I'd just develop my bishop rather then trade it or I could even consider Ba6 Bxa6 Qxa6 c5 after which his queen looks like a dingleberry over there achieving nothing. The other possible reason is to shove the e4 pawn as a breaking move in the near future after he relocated his dark squared bishop but if that was his plan then Re1 would have been slightly better in my opinion. Re1 is also the move I'd have played here if I was white.
326,7,13,1Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Poking him a litttle. White has multiple good ways to deal with it but choosing a wrong one can get really troublesome rather quickly.
327,7,14,1b3,b'1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/1PNBB3/P1P1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Not the best response in my opinion as it weakens the a1-h8 diagonal. His knight is now unprotected and on the same diagonal as a rook. Ideas of Qa5 come to mind. I think Rb1 was the best defence here. Bxa7 was also a possibility but after 11. Bxa7 Rxb2 white has an isolated c-pawn and my rook on the second rank can put some nice pressure.

"
328,7,15,1Ng4,b'1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P1n1/1PNBB3/P1P1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',b3 is something I immediately try and take advantage of. There's only 1 correct move here for white all the others lose material . This was played to put pressure on his bishop as well as making my bishop aim at c3. Note that playing Qa5 immediately wouldn't have worked because he could have just moved his knight.
329,7,16,1Qd2,b'1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P1n1/1PNBB3/P1PQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"This move is a mistake. A move that aims to solve the issue of his knight being attacked by defending it. This however means that after Nxe3 he must reply with fxe3 creating a double pawn and a serious potential weakness. And although he's defending his knight after Qa5 there's no way to defend it any further resulting in a loss of material. The best move for white would have been the quiet Bd2 in my opinion. It makes white's position look very meek but it's pretty solid. If Bd2 had been played I would have played Ne5 attacking his bishop as well as just generally being a nice square for my knight. Black would have been slightly better positionally speaking.

333,7,20,1Nb1,b'1rb2rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/q7/4P3/1P1BP3/P1PQ2PP/RN3RK1 b - -',My opponent had the choice between losing a knight or giving his rook for my powerful bishop. He chose for the better of 2 poisons in my opinion.
334,7,21,Bxa1,b'1rb2rk1/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/8/4P3/1P1BP3/P1PN2PP/b4RK1 w - -',You could argue that my bishop was better then his rook and that therefore this is a bad trade. I kind of like it though. The only thing I'm sad about is that taking advantage of the weakness on e3 will be much harder now.
335,7,22,1Rxa1,b'1rb2rk1/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/8/4P3/1P1BP3/P1PN2PP/R5K1 b - -',As a nice added bonus his rook is far less useful on a1 then it was on f1. Now the question for black is how to proceed from here as there aren't any super obvious moves here. I should aim to somehow take advantage of his doubled pawns I'm not sure how just yet.
336,7,23,1f6,b'1rb2rk1/p3p2p/2pp1pp1/8/4P3/1P1BP3/P1PN2PP/R5K1 w - -',The plan is to get g5 in play h5 etc. You can't really make a lot of progress by playing on the queenside in this position considering he has a majority there so I opt to utilise my majority to storm his king. It weakens my king safety but I don't think that white has enough material left to really threaten a lot.
337,7,24,1Bc4+,b'1rb2rk1/p3p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2B1P3/1P2P3/P1PN2PP/R5K1 b - -',An in between check which I anticipated. It's not too bothersome for black but It improves the position of his bishop slightly so it's definitely not a bad move.

340,7,27,1h5,b'1rb2r2/p3p1k1/2pp1p2/6pp/2B1P3/1P2PN1P/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - h6',Continuing the plan. Due to his earlier h3 move I'll have to consider playing g4 as the breaking move. I'm also looking on putting my rook on the h-file at this point. Looking at this I find it really hard to construct a plan here for white. g4 doesn't work moving your rook is too slow idem for moving the knight. There's just no real good way to stop my pawnstorm.
341,7,28,2h4,b'1rb2r2/p3p1k1/2pp1p2/6pp/2B1P2P/1P2PN2/P1P3P1/R5K1 b - -',Putting the question on how I want to deal with it. I like this move there's quite some people who would just play g4 as black here without thinking in an over the board game and with that destroy a large chance of them winning as it stops their advancement. g4 is probably still winning for black but it's a more difficult route to take in my opinion. I only considered 2 moves here Kh6 and Bg4.
342,7,29,2Kh6,b'1rb2r2/p3p3/2pp1p1k/6pp/2B1P2P/1P2PN2/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - -',In the end I chose for Kh6 over Bg4. I made a few calculations after the move Bg4 and although I didn't hate what I found I think that Kh6 is easier to play and more straightforward to play. My calculations were: 20. h4 Bg4 21. Nh2 gxh4 22. Nxg4 hxg4 23. Be6. There's no way to stop the bishop from regaining the pawn except to play g3 but that would require me to play h3 later on and give up the h3 pawn. He can prevent the h3 idea with Bh2 and destroy that pawns advancement. It would be a pain in the butt to deal with. Kh6 is simple but after he captures on g5 I simply recapture and go from there. 
343,7,30,2Nd4,b'1rb2r2/p3p3/2pp3k/6pp/2BNP3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 b - -',I'm a big fan of this move. Yes it opens up the f-file but as of right now I can't really do anything with that file. This attacks the c6 pawn and finally puts some pressure against black who's been in the driver seat all game. c5 gets met with Nc6 attacking the rook maybe after that he can move it to a6 and continue being annoying. It's not a game-winning move but at the very least it's a start. That being said white does have to be carefully calculate here what follows or his knight could end up being trapped.
344,7,31,2c5,b'1rb2r2/p3p3/3p3k/2p3pp/2BNP3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - -',I looked at Bb7 for a brief moment but realised it falls to Nf5+ losing a pawn for no compensation. I anticipate: 22. Nd4 c5 23. Nc6 Rb7. No matter what moves he makes after that I'll likely play Rc7 chasing away his knight and solving my issues. If I'm lucky I might even be able to trade a minor piece or even win material ( although that's probably just wishful chess ). 
345,7,32,Rb7,b'2b2r2/pr2p3/2Np3k/2p3pp/2B1P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - -',We're on to a crucial move now. If he plays Ba6 then I'm pretty sure I'll win. It looks very tasty for white but black has more then enough space to escape and probably trade a minor piece.
346,7,33,2Ba6,b'2b2r2/pr2p3/B1Np3k/2p3pp/4P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 b - -',This looks easy but it's not because of the a7 pawn or e7 pawn falling in variations of both Rb6 and Rc7 if played sloppily. The a7 or e7 pawn doesn't fall in 1 exact variations of Rb6 because of 24. Ba6 Rb6 25. Bxc8 Rxc6 but that gets met by 26. Bb7 and his bishop will be able to retreat to the pesky d5 square.  That being said I can deal with that by preparing an e6 push. All other variations offer far more trouble for as far as I've looked into them.
347,7,34,2Bd7,b'5r2/p2Bp3/2rp3k/2p3pp/4P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 b - -',I anticipated Bb7 rather then Bd7 because it'd make it easier to go to the d5 square. My response is the same regardless of wether he played Bb7 or Bd7 though.
348,7,35,2Bg8,b'6B1/p1r1p3/3p1r1k/2p3pp/4P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 b - -',This is a blunder. I can kind of understand why it was played but I'd have played Bc4 here rather then Bg8. At least that way you get your bishop on a powerful diagonal unlike Bg8 which just loses a bishop after my next move.
349,7,36,2e6,b'6B1/p1r5/3ppr1k/2p3pp/4P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/R5K1 w - -',The bishop is now blocked and after Kg7 or Rc8 it has nowhere to go at most he'll get a pawn for it with Bxe6. He can still delay this by playing Rf1 here but that doesn't change a whole lot. 28. Bg8 e6 29. Rf1 Kg7 30. Rxf6 Kxf6. After that I'll move the rook on c7 to e7 and my king back to g7 to capture the bishop. Another way to delay is to play 29. e5 dxe5 30. Rd1 after which an immediate Rc8 is neccesary. He can then get his rook to the 7th rank improving the position of his rook and probably winning the a7 pawn but that's just not adequate compensation for the bishop.
350,7,37,2Rf1,b'6B1/p1r5/3ppr1k/2p3pp/4P3/1P2P3/P1P3P1/5RK1 b - -',My opponents goes for the 29. Rf1 Kg7 30. Rxf6 Kxf6. variation it seems I find this one worse then the variation of  29. e5 dxe5 30. Rd1 because it just leave white with a clear rook down in the endgame. With e5 you can at least prevent the trade of your rook and maybe hope to snatch a pawn or 2. Also looking back on it now I realise that I messed up there's a faster variation that leads to more or less the same result namely: 29. Rf1 Rxf1+ 30. Kxf1 Re7 after which the king once again moves to g7. This variation is 1 move faster and the little nuance of the white king being on f1 rather then e1 matters close to nothing so I should have played that.
351,7,38,Rxe6,b'8/p5k1/3pr3/2p3pp/P3P3/1PP1P3/6P1/6K1 w - -',A rook up for just 1 measly pawn. This endgame is about as easy for black as you'll ever get. On top of being a rook up white's pawns are hard to defend and the white king is nowhere near them so capturing them is rather easy.
352,7,39,Rxe4,b'8/p5k1/3p4/6pp/PP2r3/4P3/6P1/6K1 w - -',If Kf2 is played then I'll just get rid of the 2 pawns on the a and b-file place my rook on the c-file and promote the pawn on the a-file. If a5 or b5 is played I'll capture the pawn that's left on the 4th rank with the same idea. It's the fastest and easiest way to checkmate. White can more or less resign here.
353,7,40,Rxa4,b'8/p5k1/3p4/1P4pp/r7/4P3/6P1/6K1 w - -',And here reuben resigned. A game well played considering and I'd definitely be up for a rematch if he ever challenges me again.

The opening doesn't hold against a good player unless he just doesn't know it and possibly never played it so it gives certain chances. My opponent obviously doesn't know it so he goes for...

361,8,7,Bxa4,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/b7/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',?? Big mistake. I should have exchanged Qs while I have the chance then taken on c2 and lost three moves saving the B and putting it on a6. Now white can easily try to trap my B with c4! and I'm forced to play c5 in order to save it after b3 and a4.

363,8,9,Nd5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p5/3n4/b7/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',I played this on purpose giving him the possibility to effectively trap my B in. After 10. c4 NxBe3 fxe3 b3 traps the B and no use Qb4+ f6 and black has the counterthreat Bc4+ (disc) winning the BQ. This was surely not so easy to see on a blitz so...

Seldom there is a position in which there is nothing more important or aggressive than castling. The important thing about castling is to be able to do it not actually doing it. But this time was very good indeed: now I have to be very very careful in my developement plan because of my QK alignement. My Bf1 is closed in and I have to find a way to castle. My advantage piece is not easy to feel right now. 
365,8,11,1Nxe3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p5/8/b7/3PnN2/PPP1QPPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',? A counterdevelopement move not good. But I looked for exchanges wanted to keep the B pair and possibly swap Q.

367,8,13,c5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/8/2p5/b7/3P1N2/PPPQ1PPP/RN3K2 w kq -',?? This was a profilactyc move. I'm not interested in delicate play I just want to finish the game soon... and I started to play very lightly. This move was an example. I have a one-move rest before the Ra8 threats my lined Q and K. What will I do? I couldn't see the dangers I was about to face. My turn. 
368,8,14,1Nc3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/8/2p5/b7/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4K2 b kq -',...being that the N threats my B. This means goodby to the B pair but a good plan to remove the Q from her awful place.

Now the game becomes interesting for the second time. BUT this move costed me the control of b5 after white's next (good!) move. I didn't see it either. This will deserve a ? at least on a serious game.

Specially because after QxB NxN Nb5 was still possible and black has to move the Q allowing RxN or Nc7+ and maybe more.

This is an irregular annotation for me as i have been playing black about 3:1 versus playing as white. i like a classic e4 opening being more a maverick player with the nimzowitcsh defense as black.

483,12,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I black continue with the 'King's Pawn Game (C20)' a standard response. For about the fist 10 moves these are all book moves so really nothing exciting. 
484,12,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Another popular move the 'King's Knight Opening (C40)'. This is something I've played very often so I'm used to it.

490,12,8,Nxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Still continuing with the Four Knights Scotch. Again not much excitement in the beginning but I'm doing my best to make the right moves of course.

493,12,11,bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I could of played 6. dxc6 but that would of most likely resulted in a Queen's exchange and I decided it was a little too early for that. 
494,12,12,Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Protecting the e4 pawn I'd say. 
495,12,13,cxd5,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b6/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious. 
496,12,14,Qe2+,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b6/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',If you look at the games Database most of these moves are the most popular made. So far it seems black has made all the most popular moves per the game database. White has not in all cases including this one. Most popular was to castle but I'd say white is being the aggressor which is no problem for him. I think both me and him work better with fewer pieces on the board and I think white is working toward exchanges here. 
497,12,15,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/3p4/8/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black could of played Be6 or Qe7 but this move would prove to be the best move. Be6 could make my king more vulnerable and Qe7 would of likely led to a Queen's exchange which I still did not want as of yet. 
498,12,16,1Bb5+,b'r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Not quite the move I was expecting. Of course expect the unexpected but I would of thought white would of castled. I'm planning to do so myself thus I won't be moving my king. 
499,12,17,1Bd7,b'r2qk2r/p1pbbppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I use my LSB to protect my king. 
500,12,18,1Bxd7+,b'r2qk2r/p1pBbppp/5n2/3p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Well that I was expecting. 
501,12,19,1Qxd7,b'r3k2r/p1pqbppp/5n2/3p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I could of done 3 other moves but they weren't as good as this one. Kxd7 would of opened my king up to white more and prevented me from castling. Nxd7 would of lost me a pawn. Of course Kf8 is useless. Thus Qxd7 was the best move as it gets my queen involved as well. . 
502,12,20,O-O,b'r4rk1/p1pqbppp/5n2/3p2B1/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black castles as planned.
503,12,21,1O-O-O,b'r4rk1/p1pqbppp/5n2/3p2B1/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2KR3R b - -',Interesting I do not see a queen-side castle all too often. The reason for this probably involved the fact that white's rook now put extra pressure on black's d5 pawn thus making this move better than a king-side castle. 
504,12,22,1c6,b'r4rk1/p2qbppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2KR3R w - -',I saw this during the game though thus I give the d5 pawn some extra protection. 
505,12,23,h6,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p2B1/8/2N2P2/PPP1Q1PP/2KR3R w - -',I decide to attack the intruding Bishop. 
506,12,24,1Bh4,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/7B/2N2P2/PPP1Q1PP/2KR3R b - -',Well I was expecting white to take my knight but this move can be expected just as much. 
507,12,25,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/7B/2N2P2/PPP1Q1PP/2KR3R w - -',This move here may not seem to have much of a point here but then I was thinking of a way to get to white's king. Obviously this is no longer the game's beginning but the middle now thus it was time to get a strategy to win. What your opponent does though will always change that strategy. 
508,12,26,1Rhe1,b'1r3rk1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/7B/2N2P2/PPP1Q1PP/2KRR3 b - -',I'll have to attend to this move. Black's e7 bishop is under pressure from white's Queen and Rook combo. Of course I see this so I counter. 
509,12,27,1Rfe8,b'1r2r1k1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/7B/2N2P2/PPP1Q1PP/2KRR3 w - -',This move was definitely the best. True I could of used my b8 rook instead of my now e8 rook but I've been taking on advice I would always forget and that was making your weakest piece stronger. 16. Rbe8 would of only hindered the other rook but Rfe8 makes both rooks doing something making them a good part of this game which gives white more to work on. In fact probably the only piece not making much of a difference on black's side at the moment is the a7 pawn. All other pieces are taking the front of white's attack. 
510,12,28,1Qd3,b'1r2r1k1/p2qbpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/7B/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',I'm not quite sure what white is planning now but of course I'm keeping an eye on things. 
511,12,29,1Bd6,b'1r2r1k1/p2q1pp1/2pb1n1p/3p4/7B/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',Before I go on I will use the game database quite often in creating annotations when it comes to the beginning stages. I use the computer analysis for the rest. I do this to get a better understanding of the game. In fact the computer analysis always helps me see moves I didn't see when I'm creating annotations. It's kinda amazing but not even the computer analysis mentioned any kind of mistake until this move. 17 moves without any mistakes considering the ratings of both players is pretty impressive. I am aware that strong players and grand masters can see mistakes the computer cannot but the computer can still be reliable. For instance this move is a inaccuracy because if white plays Bxf6 next move the only good move black can make is gxf6 which would open up black's king to white. Although it's not that big of a mistake even a small mistake can change the outcome of a game.  
512,12,30,1Rxe8+,b'1r2R1k1/p2q1pp1/2pb1n1p/3p4/7B/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KR4 b - -',Okay I was not quite expecting this. This move is not bad at all but I would think Bxf6 would of been just slightly better because of the reasons I stated in the previous move. 
513,12,31,1Nxe8,b'1r2n1k1/p2q1pp1/2pb3p/3p4/7B/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KR4 w - -',By now I did see the danger my knight and king were in thus with the d5 pawn well protected I took white's rook with my knight. 
514,12,32,1Bg3,b'1r2n1k1/p2q1pp1/2pb3p/3p4/8/2NQ1PB1/PPP3PP/2KR4 b - -',Another piece exchange is about to occur here. As I mentioned earlier I think I do play better with fewer pieces on the board and I think the same goes for white. 
515,12,33,2hxg3,b'1r2n1k1/p2q1pp1/2p4p/3p4/8/2NQ1PP1/PPP3P1/2KR4 b - -',Even exchange as mentioned. 
516,12,34,2Nf6,b'1r4k1/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/2NQ1PP1/PPP3P1/2KR4 w - -',With white's bishop gone I decide to put my knight back where it was. 
517,12,35,2b3,b'1r4k1/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/1PNQ1PP1/P1P3P1/2KR4 b - -',I think white responded here to my b8 rook threat at last. 
518,12,36,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/1PNQ1PP1/P1P3P1/2KR4 w - -',I decide to plan an advancement with my d5 pawn by doubling up the queen and rook. 
519,12,37,2Kb2,b'3r2k1/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/1PNQ1PP1/PKP3P1/3R4 b - -',It kinda looks like white is in a standoff kind of position with this move.
520,12,38,2Kf8,b'3r1k2/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/1PNQ1PP1/PKP3P1/3R4 w - -',I don't really know why I made this move. As you can see this game took almost 2 months to complete and I was under lots of stress during the period of this game actually so slow move times plus stress well I may of simply forgot what I had planned to do. Oh well this move isn't any bad either. 
521,12,39,2g4,b'3r1k2/p2q1pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/6P1/1PNQ1P2/PKP3P1/3R4 b - -',Connecting the pawns. 
522,12,40,2g5,b'3r1k2/p2q1p2/2p2n1p/3p2p1/6P1/1PNQ1P2/PKP3P1/3R4 w - g6',Here I decide to stop any forward progression of white's pawns without a fight of course. This is an inaccuracy though per what the computer analysis says. This is because white can advance his pieces to a position where I have to back off into a corner kind of which is never a good thing but this is still only a small mistake. 
523,12,41,2Qf5,b'3r1k2/p2q1p2/2p2n1p/3p1Qp1/6P1/1PN2P2/PKP3P1/3R4 b - -',Not what I was expecting. In fact the computer sees this as a mistake for if queens are exchanged black can advance his pieces to where he can gain white's three f and g pawns which would allow black to gain the advantage provided I do decide to exchange.
524,12,42,2Qxf5,b'3r1k2/p4p2/2p2n1p/3p1qp1/6P1/1PN2P2/PKP3P1/3R4 w - -',I do decide here that I'm ready to exchange not only because of his queen being a threat but also I can knock his pawns out of formation a little. At least this is what I was thinking when doing this. I did not have the knowledge of the computer analysis then of course so I was going by what I saw was best. 
525,12,43,c5,b'3r1k2/p4p2/5n1p/2pp1Pp1/8/1PN2P2/PKP3P1/3R4 w - -',This was not one of my better moves but although this is another inaccuracy per the computer analysis the only thing I could find wrong with this move is that white could advance some and back me up some which is still not a good thing but still only a minor mistake if even that in my opinion. 
526,12,44,2g4,b'3r1k2/p4p2/5n1p/2pp1Pp1/6P1/1PN2P2/PKP5/3R4 b - g3',White reorganizes his pawns. 
527,12,45,2a6,b'3r1k2/5p2/p4n1p/2pp1Pp1/6P1/1PN2P2/PKP5/3R4 w - -',Although d4 may of been a good move here looking at this position now white won't play Nb5 with this move so this is a good move. 
528,12,46,2a4,b'3r1k2/5p2/p4n1p/2pp1Pp1/P5P1/1PN2P2/1KP5/3R4 b - a3',Now this the computer analysis says this is an inaccuracy. This is one of those times where you don't have to listen to the computer because I could not find anything wrong with this move. I'm sure someone can but simply put I'm not that skilled. Maybe there was a better move but in my view this move isn't bad. 
529,12,47,2d4,b'3r1k2/5p2/p4n1p/2p2Pp1/P2p2P1/1PN2P2/1KP5/3R4 w - -',Now I play d4. This of course means that white will have to defend his knight. 
530,12,48,2Ne4,b'3r1k2/5p2/p4n1p/2p2Pp1/P2pN1P1/1P3P2/1KP5/3R4 b - -',I was expecting this move. 
531,12,49,2fxe4,b'3r1k2/5p2/p6p/2p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/1KP5/3R4 b - -',Once again an even exchange. 
532,12,50,2f6,b'3r1k2/8/p4p1p/2p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/1KP5/3R4 w - -',As you can see this game continues to be very even still. White may be a little more organized which might be why the computer analysis gives white the advantage at this moment. 
533,12,51,3Re1,b'3r1k2/8/p4p1p/2p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/1KP5/4R3 b - -',I'm thinking white may try advancing his e pawn. I wasn't considering that then. 
534,12,52,3a5,b'3r1k2/8/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/1KP5/4R3 w - -',This move would be an inaccuracy per the computer analysis. I can see why Re8 was the best move for then white wouldn't advance his e pawn. If he does advance it now it would for sure cost me a pawn no matter what I do. Although only a pawn when you look at the board now just one pawn could mean the game. 
535,12,53,3Kc1,b'3r1k2/8/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2P5/2K1R3 b - -',? Not e5? I didn't realize it then but looking now I am a bit surprised he didn't play e5. Maybe he has a plan of his own? Of course the computer analysis sees this as a inaccuracy.
536,12,54,3Kf7,b'3r4/5k2/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2P5/2K1R3 w - -',I decide to give my f6 pawn some more protection with this move in case white advances. 
537,12,55,3Kd2,b'3r4/5k2/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2PK4/4R3 b - -',Another king move by white. Although the computer sees this as an inaccuracy I can't see why. This isn't a bad move but e5 is definitely the best. In fact white is planning something but black will catch on. 
538,12,56,3Rh8,b'7r/5k2/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2PK4/4R3 w - -',Alright this is where it gets more interesting! Now I'm focused on advancing the g pawn! 
539,12,57,3Rh1,b'7r/5k2/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2PK4/7R b - -',White is on to my plan already although this was another inaccuracy per computer analysis. If you look at the analysis for this move you can see why this is an inaccuracy. If white had played Kd3 instead he would of had a better chance of keeping my pawn from advancing and keeping the game very even probably to the point of a draw. 
540,12,58,3Ke7,b'7r/4k3/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P6/2PK4/7R w - -',I actually see this plan white has which is to attack the d c and a pawns so now I'm ready to stop any plans by white in case he does advance the king towards my pawns. 
541,12,59,3Kd3,b'7r/4k3/5p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P1K4/2P5/7R b - -',He does advance his king so now I think we all know what I'll do next.
542,12,60,3Rf1,b'7r/8/3k1p1p/p1p2Pp1/P2pP1P1/1P1K4/2P5/5R2 b - -',The game is no longer even. Mistake by white. This is because now the chances of black promoting their g pawn has increased and white will have to work to keep it from happening. 
543,12,61,3h5,b'7r/8/3k1p2/p1p2Ppp/P2pP1P1/1P1K4/2P5/5R2 w - -',If you couldn't see it in the previous move you can probably now see why white shouldn't of moved his rook to where he did. 
544,12,62,Rxh5,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2Ppr/P2pP3/1P1K4/2P5/5R2 w - -',Now the g pawn is in great position. 
545,12,63,3Rf3,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2Ppr/P2pP3/1P1K1R2/2P5/8 b - -',Another mistake by white. The computer analysis says this because if black plays it right black can gain white's e and f pawns. This I did not see though during the game. 
546,12,64,3g4,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2P1r/P2pP1p1/1P1K1R2/2P5/8 w - -',Advancing the pawn. 
547,12,65,3Rf1,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2P1r/P2pP1p1/1P1K4/2P5/5R2 b - -',A bit surprised white played that instead of Rg3. That would of kept my pawn from advancing further and then I would have to move my rook to either g5 or h4 to protect my pawn. 
548,12,66,3g3,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2P1r/P2pP3/1P1K2p1/2P5/5R2 w - -',I didn't see all the good moves thus this is an inaccuracy. This move can allow white to take my advancing pawn and exchange rooks. Although that would still leave white in a hard place what I have now would be better. 
549,12,67,Rg5,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2Pr1/P2pP3/1P1K2p1/2P5/6R1 w - -',White moves his rook of course I protect. 
550,12,68,4c3,b'8/8/3k1p2/p1p2Pr1/P2pP3/1PPK2p1/8/6R1 b - -',I was expecting white to get their king involved but I guess he may be wanting to advance his pawns as well. 
551,12,69,4Ke5,b'8/8/5p2/p1p1kPr1/P2pP3/1PPK2p1/8/6R1 w - -',I could of taken but I saw a better formation in getting my king involved. 
552,12,70,4cxd4+,b'8/8/5p2/p1p1kPr1/P2PP3/1P1K2p1/8/6R1 b - -',No surprise here. 
553,12,71,4cxd4,b'8/8/5p2/p3kPr1/P2pP3/1P1K2p1/8/6R1 w - -',Resignation by white. ??? Um surprise? Not what I was expecting at all! Well you can tell me was this game a win by black or could white pull off a draw? I think it was more of a draw than a win for black at least in my view. White still had options for sure. Well maybe the game ended prematurely but what a game it was! I'm glad I was able to show the skill I did. I'm sure I'll have even more great games against this opponent in the future! Now interesting side note in the final moves of this game I had someone watching this game and telling me that I should offer a draw. I don't know why but as we can see I wouldn't of won if I did. So don't always listen to someone if you think you can do better. Yes in some cases but not all cases. Well anyway I hope you all enjoyed my annotation! I'll be sure to have another one way sooner this time. Until next time ;)
554,13,0,Bxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A normal Icelandic asset. White is not likely to be familiar with it.

This third game had a more classical development and i wanted to show a possible result and also save this game >< i hope you enjoy.

its meant to undermine whites middle and take it for yourself. the proper reply is d5 to take middle and recapture the pawn with your WSB"

650,15,5,Bxf5,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/1B1p1b2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',followed by recapturing the pawn   some whites will double pawn you here immediately if they dont know the lines well and to avoid further black shannanigans a double pawn situation is acceptable and very playable for the black as this opening makes for a strong king side attack and apart from getting double pawned it might be the only time you play on the queen side of the board.

All in all I attacked very vehemently and sacrificed a lot of material but black kept finding resources to escape the many mate threats.
So I ended up with this position and an unclear endgame where I can get back the h8 rook but loose the b pawn.
My somewhat hasty attack was brushed aside by this creative and resourceful opponent that kept finding defenses in very difficult positions.
However this game shows that the Muzio Gambit is nevertheless a potent surprise weapon that generates very interesting and fun games.
It is a huge risk but unless black defends very accurately he will be overrun.
I will definitely retry it get a feeling for it and would recommend it to any aggressive player that is reading this annotation.

Qh7 Bd3 g6 or else the Queen must be given up. In this line the kingside is cramped and misplaced and slightly more defensible for Black would appear to be aiming for a O-O-O. But this would require at least two more moves of development and White already has an attacking synergy. If Qd8 O-O-O is virtually outright discouraged and Black has lost massive amounts of tempo. White has a clear advantage here already- which you're about to see me blow completely.
811,18,11,d5,b'r1b1k1nr/ppppqpp1/2n1p2p/3PP3/1bP5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Ugh. When I was looking through this I was telling myself that I didn't really care so much had Black played Bxc3 because if Bxc3+ bxc3 seems to help White move control of the center along. White would have pawns on c3-d4-e5 which allows my side of the board more space to pressure Black for being too cramped in. The doubled pawn on c4 could go to c5 and help me control virtually every dark square that I'd need to pressure Black's King wherever they decide to castle. So I play this thinking I can keep boxing Black in while completely forgetting that this was just about my worst possible move. d4 was so central to all of my attacking and defending plans. This was just an awful case of a brain lapse on my part.

A huge White advantage thrown at me within the first two moves of the match just for me to throw it right back in one huge overstep. I was pretty flustered by this point.

841,18,41,2Rfe1,b'r1b3k1/1q1p1pp1/1ppBrn1p/pP3Q2/P1P5/2N2BP1/5P1P/3RR1K1 b - -',One rook one knight three pawns. Once they fall the Black King is left staring alone in a faceoff with my remaining pieces and that will never change for as long as the c6-d7 pawns are pinned. And it's about to get a whole lot more ugly for Black: with the rook on e6 capture is unavoidable.
842,18,42,2g6,b'r1b3k1/1q1p1p2/1ppBrnpp/pP3Q2/P1P5/2N2BP1/5P1P/3RR1K1 w - -',Black realizes this but figures there's safety by trying to kick the Queen away. GK recommends Qh3 threatening Qxh6. Instead I play an even stronger move. 
843,18,43,2Rxe6,b'r1b3k1/1q1p1p2/1ppBRnpp/pP3Q2/P1P5/2N2BP1/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Black must now decide if opening the confined corner is worth me keeping my queen....!!!!

845,18,45,2Rxf6,b'r1b3k1/1q1p1p2/1ppB1R1p/pP3p2/P1P5/2N2BP1/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',In return Black's remaining power pieces remain imprisoned and they will never reach the King to save it in time as all that remains for his safety are mismatched pawns.
846,18,46,2Kg7,b'r1b5/1q1p1pk1/1ppB1R1p/pP3p2/P1P5/2N2BP1/5P1P/3R2K1 w - -',The King comes to shoo my Rook away.

I didn't spot the forced mate from start to finish but here I had a good idea of how to build the mating net. Can someone walk me through how the Mate was SUPPOSED to go?
849,18,49,2Bh5,b'r1b5/q2p1pk1/1ppB3p/pP3R1B/P1P5/2N3P1/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',I start here removing the King's most aggressive flight square.
850,18,50,2f6,b'r1b5/q2p2k1/1ppB1p1p/pP3R1B/P1P5/2N3P1/5P1P/3R2K1 w - -',Forced or Rxf7+ wins faster.
851,18,51,2Re1,b'r1b5/q2p2k1/1ppB1p1p/pP3R1B/P1P5/2N3P1/5P1P/4R1K1 b - -',But with d7 frozen in place the other Rook can enter the mating trap without issue. Gameknot still says I'm wasting time and that I'm still within Mate in 8.
852,18,52,2cxb5,b'r1b5/q2p2k1/1p1B1p1p/pp3R1B/P1P5/2N3P1/5P1P/4R1K1 w - -',-And now it's Mate in 5. So the computer states every time Black attempts to free the pieces it's a losing blunder but honestly what other choice is there?
853,18,53,2Re7+,b'r1b5/q2pR1k1/1p1B1p1p/pp3R1B/P1P5/2N3P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',Now there's only the Back Rank and my key proximal pieces are guarded.

It's a fantastic flight square really- somehow I couldn't really see how I could Mate with only the four pieces. And I had to act with more precision right away- if I screw up the next move Black plays Bb7 freeing the rook to defend and it's only going to get harder to threaten the Mate!
855,18,55,2Ne4,b'r1b4k/q2pR3/1p1B1p1p/pp3R1B/P1P1N3/6P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',And at the end of the day it turns out that had Black merely played Bxc3+ all that time ago I might not have been able to win the game at all! Not only was this knight lucky to be alive it likely turned out to be the very reason I won this game without endless perpetuals!
856,18,56,2bxc4,b'r1b4k/q2pR3/1p1B1p1p/p4R1B/P1p1N3/6P1/5P1P/6K1 w - -',And here I think Black realized Mate in 2 was unavoidable and signals having given up.

Trying to get better at these but all the sharp play this game demanded from me in order to keep on my feet made playing my opponent so much more fun. There was a lot of unusual play unusual play that I had to keep myself focused on careful calculated moves because I saw the punishment in overstepping too soon before the game had ended. There was another game as Black I had due to the League setup which was just as fun albeit it more obvious and quicker. Hope you enjoyed reading this game as much as I enjoyed playing it!

869,19,11,f3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4q3/3n2b1/P1NPBP2/1PPQ2PP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',time to cause some disruption break his pawn line and get the bishop at a cost of my knight and im breaking this board open so thats perfect to trade knights out for his bishops.

This was the closest I have ever been to becoming The-Black-Queen.  Right until the end I had a winning advantage over Michael but due in large part to Old Matey (in the form of Michael's queen) sniffing around Henry I ended up forcing a queen trade and immediately hitting the offer draw button.  Michael duly accepted the offer.  Little did I know that the gameknot analysis was about to show that I had a winning alternative continuation to initiating the queen trade.  I now feel as though I bottled it.  So how did this all happen?  Well here is the gameknot analysis below:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22336553&rnd=0.7168277988215053"

926,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I would like to congratulate Russ20124 on an excellent game played. Russ20124 wanted to learn more about playing Queen pawn games and there is no better way to do that but to challenge an expert in the field. Russ20124 does well until he goes off the beaten trail and finds himself in serious trouble. However Elyhim passes him a get out of jail card and the game continues. It is not until Russ20124 fails to see a tactic that he falls to the sword. 
927,21,1,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',An interesting approach to playing the queen pawn system. It is my opinion that the knight is much better on c3 where it has greater control over what happens in the center. Also it does not block the DSB which in this game never leaves home base. The lesson to learn here is to always play the optimal move that gives your pieces their greatest scope. In the openning phase development should be your #1 priority. 
928,21,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',setting up the standard Queen pawn structure for black. It challenges for control of the center as well as frees the DSB for active duty. 
929,21,3,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',From black's perspective this known as the Semi-Tarrassh setup where black mirrors white pawns on d4 and c4. The plan for black is to develop his bishops on d6 and d7 with a knights on f6 and c6. As for the queen she is the most flexible which is able to go to e7 c7 or even b6 and a5 if the situation requires it. 
930,21,4,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I would have played 5. e3 defending c4 and opening lanes for the LSB. Here white violates one of the cardinal rules of chess. Which is do not engage in the center until most of your pieces are developed. As opening the center usually benefits the one with the edge in development. 
931,21,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3P4/3p4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',One of the hallmarks of master level play is to develop as the expense of your opponent. Here white is forced to recapture on d4 with his knight at which point black can develop his queen to the powerful d5 square threatening to capture on d4. This leaves black with the greatest control of the center which is a prelude to successful attack. When defending it is imperative to maintain the balance in the center. What I mean by this is to keep it closed and pawn structures should mirror each other. 
932,21,6,e3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3q4/3N4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',good move supporting the knight in the center. 
933,21,7,Bd7,b'rn2kb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/3q4/3N4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',no point in challenging the knight as white can simply exchange on c6 and sattle black with a weak pawn on c6 
934,21,8,Bc4,b'rn2kb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/3q4/2BN4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',opps! big mistake. White is trying to develop and attack the black queen at the same time which in theory is a good idea. However the problem is that it drops the pawn on g2!. So black should simple play 8. ...Qxg2 and the game is over. White should have done is play 8. N4f3 Be7 9. Bc4 and white is A okay
935,21,9,Qa5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/q7/2BN4/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',cutting white some slack

However the threat is on d4 and by adopting a indirect defense requires considerable skill and technique. What I mean is to keep things simple and play smart moves. Here I would have played the simple 10. N4f3 Be7 11. B3 with a small advantage for white. While being to cute the other drawbacks of Nb3 is that the knight is out of play and hangs the bishop on c4

If black could offer exchange of queens at some point then it may help his cause!

If a queen exchange was offered after 10..Nxf4 11.exf4-Qd5 12.Qxd5-exd5
then after some Knight moving i would gain the pawn on d5 and taking me a pawn up.

So the point to the start of the game! Never make to many pawn moves in the opening unless forced or you have a concrete understanding of the opening employed develop fast with a view of where the pawns and pieces will be best placed for an endgame ie no doubling of pawns avoid isolated pawns and avoid to many exchanges leading to to many pawn islands."

Yet again it has been a long time since my last annotation.  Thankfully my dad has now settled in to his care home and his house is now being let so I can give my attention to some chessic issues.  This game was played between myself and a long-standing on the board nemesis dmaestro (Mike).  Do not be fooled by that Class B rating he has got.  At the top of his game he is an expert!  In quite a large percentage of my games against him he like the Dentist had managed to inflict severe passivitis on me in the middlegame.  Sometimes I have managed to turn the tables on these two opponents but more often than not particularly with Mike - he has gone on to win.  In this game it certainly looked as though I was set to lose not just the game but my Class A rating.  I thought of hitting that resign button quite a few times in the endgame but something kept me from doing this and I ended up teetering on the brink.  So what was the final twist here?  Well you will just have to read on.  Below is the gameknot analysis version:  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22168815&fb=1&rnd=0.5423497644644992"

Bg6 - I dare not play g6 here because the Witch is backed up by Mike's dsb (although a white knight momentarily stands in the way) this could easily lead to Henry copping Old Matey so I try and keep things as closed as possible but now I start to lose material.

This is one reason why I hesitated on hitting that resign button - I am now 3 material points down - as the possibility of a perpetual starts to form in my mind.
1072,26,30,Qe3+,b'1r4k1/6P1/3p1B2/6Pp/5P2/4q3/6Q1/5RK1 w - -',50. .... Qe3+ - now four material points down but at least Glenda is in the right area!

1074,26,32,5Qxh5,b'1r4k1/6P1/3p1B2/6PQ/5P2/5RK1/4q3/8 b - -',55. Qxh5? - grabs another pawn and leaves Henry shivering.  The Witch is threatening to descend on h8 at any moment. However I give that move a question mark because ......
1075,26,33,5Qe1+,b'1r4k1/6P1/3p1B2/6PQ/5P2/5RK1/8/4q3 w - -',55. ...... Qe1+ - CHEEECK!  Now Glenda is in a position to harass King Mike.  Can her checks be perpetually annoying?  We shall see.
1076,26,34,Qd1+,b'1r4k1/6P1/3p1B2/6PQ/5PK1/6R1/8/3q4 w - -',57. ..... Qd1+ - DRAW OFFER .....

1079,26,37,Rb6+,b'6k1/6P1/1r1K1B2/6PQ/5P2/5R2/q7/8 w - -',65. .... Rb6+ - another pawn drops and I am now the equivalent of a rook and pawn behind not to mention Henry being in Old Matey's shadow but the main thing is King Mike is still being hounded by Glenda and my rook.
1080,26,38,Rd6+,b'6k1/6P1/3r1B2/q5PQ/3K1P2/5R2/8/8 w - -',67.  ..... Rd6+ - King Mike now has to be very careful.  With my rook joining in the fun he could now walk into a lawnmower type mating net.

It's not played a lot in real life games so there's not much opening theory behind it. I suppose the opponent wants to draw me out of the book lines. I personally think it's a mistake since it allows black to equalize far too easily after an eventual d5 push.That being said black still has to be a little bit careful. The proper move order to equalize has to be e6 -> Nc6 -> d5. Nc6 generally has to be played before the d5 push since otherwise the black king is exposed on the a4-e8 diagonal. White can then play Bb5+ immediately or in the near future and it makes things slightly bothersome. An example could be 1.	e4	c5
2.	Bc4	e6
3.	Nf3	d5
4.	Bb5+	Nc6
5.	exd5	exd5
6.	Ne5.	
This cramps the position for black enormously. Of course you can always play Bd7 to defend rather than Nc6 but that isn't optimal either. I'm pretty sure that Bd7 does also lead to at least a positional advantage for white. If It wasn't for me preferring the Taimanov Sicilian I probably wouldn't know about this tiny piece of opening theory that Bc4 brings so I can definitely see how it could throw d6 Sicilian players out of their comfort zone."

1173,31,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Preparing d5 and immediately putting a halt to b4 ideas. I was also considering a6 with the idea to chase his bishop to the end of the earth. ( figuratively speaking of course ) That being said Nc6 is probably the best/most multifunctional move here.
1174,31,4,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',And the fun starts.
1175,31,5,exd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pP4/2B5/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I wonder is immediately retreating the bishop better or does it leave too much pressure?
1176,31,6,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/1Bpp4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I actually wasn't expecting this move despite it being such an important theme in the limited amount of opening theory for this opening. It's probably correct but trading here doesn't seem optimal for white. Granted I get 3 finicky pawns but that's worth it considering the development and space advantage I'd have after bxc6. I was anticipating either Ba2 of Bb3.
1177,31,7,Bxc6+,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2B2n2/2pp4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This feels too early. You usually don't want to get rid of pins as they sometimes can be exploited. For example if white had played Nf3 here instead then black would have to be cautious of Ne5 ideas in the future which is a move solely possible because the knight on c6 wouldn't be able to move. 
1178,31,8,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',The bishop pair a semi-open b-file  strong control of the center and a potential a6 square for my light squared bishop. I can definitely work with this. It aren't game winning advantages just yet but white will have to thread carefully. The only real weakness black has are double pawns and a very weak c6 pawn but that pawn isn't that easy to reach for white at this moment.
1179,31,9,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/2pp4/6b1/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I immediately wanted to seize the initiative.  9.h3 Bb5 10. g4 creates too much issues for white in my opinion since it makes castling king side really risky and his queen side isn't exactly the most solid fortress either.

Qe7 almost ensures a queen trade but I'm so ahead in development that it seems really questionable to me. I guess his plan is to trade all the pieces of the board and then try and pry on the c6 pawn ( which believe it or not is actually a mistake and his eventual downfall. )
1183,31,13,Bxe7,b'r3k2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp3b/8/P2P1N1P/1PP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Almost fully developed and ready to rumble. The past 11 moves were unusual but not abnormally exciting but the real fun will soon start.

Better would have been to castle kingside or play something like Bf4. At this point in time I start calculating whether or not it's worth it to make him win the pawn on c6 if he moves the same knight a 3th time.

Usually my games tend to go on for quite a while this one was a lot different.It was amusing to finish a teamgame the same day as it started. Guess the moral of the story is: don't move the same minor piece 3 times for a pawn if it gives the other side attacking options.

1358,36,8,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/2BN4/8/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Seeing that taking the pawn is dangerous for black he opts to hoick the king out of the center before all hell breaks loose. At this point in my prep the computers first suggestion was 14.Bxf6 which led to some awesome stuff in many lines and gave white a great game but looking over reams of different lines I came to the conclusion that black had ways to equalize and even gain advantage with accurate play. However I felt there must be something better for white. 
1359,36,9,1Bd3,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',[!] Something of a Eureka moment for me after some time I was able to determine that this forces matters nicely as now black comes under heavy attacks in all lines.
1360,36,10,1Bxh2+,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p3pn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPb/R3R1K1 w - -',Black only has two good moves in the position. This and the other being 14...Nd5!? to which I had ready 15.Qh5 applying the pressure and forcing and forcing black to weaken his king ...h6? is met with the very dangerous 16.Bxh6! gxh6 17.Qxh6 f6 is blacks best defense and the computer suggests 18.Nxe6 and announces that if black defends accuratly white must play a perpetual. But I was able to prove to it after some work that infact stronger is 18.Rxe6!? Bxe6 once again the engine insists that white must play a perpetual but actually it turns out that white can still play for a win without the rook. in any case it is hard to imagine any black player willingly entering 14...Nd5 15.Qh5 h6?! 16.Bxh6 gxh6 17.Qxh6 f6 as its clear only white can play for a win there so instead I'd expect 15...g6 16.Qh4 and with blacks weakened dark squares white will have a pleasant long lasting initiative on the kingside with the advantage and good game. Black didnt go for any of that though.
1361,36,11,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p3pn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPb/R3R2K b - -',Believe it or not black only has one move in the position. 15...Bf5 is now forced with the continuation 15...Bf5 16.Bxf6 gxf6 17.Qg4+ and in my analysis I found white gets a very strong attack in all lines with trouble occurring on h2 or black losing a bishop with g3/F4 and possible trouble on the h file I would have been comfortable with that line. 
1362,36,12,1Bd6,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K w - -',[??] black falls for one of the many devious traps I had prepared in the position. After this black is lost and falls apart very quickly indeed.
1363,36,13,1Bxf6,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpB2/8/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K b - -',first white weakens blacks king and removes the defender to h7 
1364,36,14,1Bxh7+,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2p1B/p2bpp2/8/3N4/8/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K b - -',[!!] and now follows up with a beautiful sacrifice that wins the game outright. 17.Qg4+! was also game winning. But this move aside from being both more forcing and more daunting to meet OTB also happens to be much more aesthetically pleasing
1365,36,15,1Kxh7,b'r1b2r2/1pq2p1k/p2bpp2/8/3N4/8/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K w - -',technically it is slightly better to not take the bishop. But as white is clearly trivially winning in that line I think black is better off testing whites idea to see if it is sound.
1366,36,16,1Qg4+,b'r1b2r2/1pq2pk1/p2bpp2/8/3N2Q1/8/PPP2PP1/R3R2K b - -',forcing the king to the h file 
1367,36,17,2Re3,b'r1b2r2/1pq2p1k/p2bpp2/8/3N2Q1/4R3/PPP2PP1/R6K b - -',And now preparing to swing over to h3 to deliver mate. The only way for black to prevent it is to play ...Bg3 shedding masses of material. instead black allows me to deliver mate besides white still needs to make one accurate move.
1368,36,18,2Qh4,b'r1b2r2/1pq2p1k/p3pp1b/8/3N3Q/7R/PPP2PP1/R6K b - -',The final detail notice that 22.Qh5?? allows black to defend with Qf4 but by placing the queen on h4 instead white ensures that there is no longer any defense to mate.
1369,36,19,2Qh8#,b'r1br2kQ/1pq2p2/p3pp2/8/3N4/7R/PPP2PP1/R6K b - -',Hope you enjoyed and/or learnt something. I think these sort of games are instructive as it demonstrates a number of useful patters on how to break down a castled king position. perhaps what was most fun about this game is that since it was all prep I ended up playing all my moves as fast as I could right them on my score sheet meaning that with the time control 90 minutes + 30 seconds per move I actually finished with 6 minutes more than what I started with. The entire game took just under 15 minutes and was over before some games had even started.
1370,37,0,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',All standard Sicilian Najdorf variation so far hacked out at speed by both of us.  This move signifies the English Attack normally.  On Gameknot I don't have a good record against it.  I normally play 6 ...e5 which forces White to move the Nd4 but leaves a hole at d5 that White may subsequently exploit.  I've also toyed with an immediate 6....Ng4 to harass the Be3 but with limited success.  This game I decided on a more conservative approach.
1371,37,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A standard Scheveningen formation I believe.
1372,37,2,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White continues with minor piece development.  This is a very flexible move giving the B good scope.  I'd expected 7. f3 followed by a g4 advance as is standard in the English Attack but I don't think there's anything wrong with this move.
1373,37,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',We've both elected to castle kingside and put development before tactics as advised in all good chess primers.  However as is typical of many Sicilian variations White's pieces are better developed than Black's whose pawns have made more moves so I'd normally expect a vigorous attack from White to begin now.
1374,37,4,f4,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - f3',Sure enough the f-pawn launches forward and White is threatening to attack Black's central pawn fortification.
1375,37,5,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I continue with my development preferring this square for the QN as it both supports the other N on f6 and also covers e5 and c5.  If I can get ...Nc5 in I can counter-attack White's e-pawn.
1376,37,6,1Bf3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White occupies the long diagonal discouraging me from playing the standard ...b5 advance followed by fianchetto on b7.  This also over-defends e4 if he doesn't want to advance it.
1377,37,7,1Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A standard square for the Q.  I played this now in order to enable ...b5 and ...Bb7 followed by centralisation of the Ra8.
1378,37,8,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/5P2/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',!? White spots the opportunity to win a pawn and fork Q and R if Black allows 12. fxe6 fxe6 13. Nxe6!  So this appears to force a careful response from Black.  I actually didn't think very long about my reply though as I spotted an attractive move to unclog my position exploiting a newly available square.
1379,37,9,1Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/4nP2/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This frees up the Bc8 to defend e6 and simultaneously threatens to swap the N from White's Bf3 giving Black an advantage on the White squares.
1380,37,10,Nxf3+,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2pPn2/8/3NP3/2N1Bn2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The immediate recapture on e6 would have allowed White to avoid the swap so I preferred to interpose this move.  The disadvantage of this sequence is that Black ends up with an awkward pawn formation of three islands of 2 and is faced with the threat that White will storm Black's position by exploiting the open f-file.  However I felt that I could cope with that.
1381,37,11,1Qxf3,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2pPn2/8/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',White now also has options to play Qg3 followed by Bh6 if he so chooses.
1382,37,12,1fxe6,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1b1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',I preferred this recapture to the B recapture as I wanted to preserve the advantage of 2 bishops if at all possible.  Furthermore the swap on f3 had been intended to create an advantage on White squares dependent on keeping the B which currently also supports the central pawn island.
1383,37,13,1Qe2,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1b1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',?!  Odd.  Not quite sure why he played this.
1384,37,14,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/1pqbb1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Now I wanted to connect and possibly double my rooks as quickly as possible.
1385,37,15,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/1pqbb1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Standard developing move but White is not creating any immediarte threats or exploiting the weaknesses in Black's position.
1386,37,16,1Rf7,b'r5k1/1pqbbrpp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Preparing to double on the f-file in the hope of converting a perceived weakness into a strength.
1387,37,17,1Nf3,b'r5k1/1pqbbrpp/p2ppn2/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Threatening to attack the Rf7.  I can't now double because the Rf7 would be trapped after 16...Rf7 17. Ng5.
1388,37,18,1h6,b'r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2ppn1p/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Hence this defensive push that leaves a hole on g6.  If I'd been White I would have rushed to exploit this with 17. Nh4.
1389,37,19,1Bd4,b'r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2ppn1p/8/3BP3/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',But White clearly had other plans.  Maybe 16. Nf3 had been played with the objective of enabling this all along.  White now threatens to advance his isolated pawn and use e5 as a strongpoint from which to attack Black's line of pieces on his second rank.
1390,37,20,1e5,b'r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/3BP3/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',So he's succeeded in provoking this move which creates another hole on d5 but frees up my B to exploit the white squares.
1391,37,21,1Bf2,b'r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1QBPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Not sure that this is better than 18. Be3.

1394,37,24,1Be6,b'5rk1/1pq1brp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P3/2N2N1P/PPP1QBP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Taking advantage of the space created by 17...e5 I improve the position of this B and cover the hole on d5 with a view to enabling my N to move and free up my Rs.
1395,37,25,2Nh4,b'5rk1/1pq1brp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P2N/2N4P/PPP1QBP1/3R1RK1 b - -',? White gets his N move in before I can threatening once more to disrupt my plans; but now I spot another opportunity that White appears to have overlooked.
1396,37,26,2Bc4,b'5rk1/1pq1brp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/2b1P2N/2N4P/PPP1QBP1/3R1RK1 w - -',! Now I skewer White's Q and R threatening to win a material advantage.  Beacuse his Q is attacked directly White can't interpose a counter-threat like 21. Ng6.  White's gurning confirmed that he hadn't expected this.
1397,37,27,2Qe3,b'5rk1/1pq1brp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/2b1P2N/2N1Q2P/PPP2BP1/3R1RK1 b - -',After grimacing he played this quickly ...
1398,37,28,2Bxf1,b'5rk1/1pq1brp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/4P2N/2N1Q2P/PPP2BP1/3R1bK1 w - -',Having first checked that I wasn't walking into something I too played this quickly.
1399,37,29,Kh7,b'5r2/1pq1brpk/p2p1n1p/4p3/4P2N/2N1Q2P/PPP2BP1/5RK1 w - -',Played to prevent Ng6 as I didn't want to have to move my Rf8 again.
1400,37,30,Rd8,b'3r4/1pq1brpk/p2p1n1p/4pN2/4P3/2N1Q2P/PPP2BP1/5RK1 w - -',But now I decided I had to move it anyway in order to prevent him building up unmeetable pressure on d6.  Up to this point I'd been ahead on the clock but now I spent about 15 mins each on my next few moves calculating all sorts of variations and rejecting various risky moves that I can't now remember!
1401,37,31,2Kh1,b'3r4/1pq1brpk/p2p1n1p/4pN2/4P3/2N1Q2P/PPP2BP1/5R1K b - -',I wasn't quite sure what this was played for: probably to allow his B to retreat while retaining control of the g1-a7 diagonal or to allow Rg1 supporting a pawn advance.

1404,37,34,2Rdf8,b'5r2/1p2brpk/p1qp1n1p/4pN2/4P2B/2N1Q2P/PPP3P1/5R1K w - -',With White no longer threatening to build up intolerable pressure on d6 but instead causing me a headache on the h4-d8 diagonal I eventually shifted the R back again.  Most of my thought had gone into calculating variations based on N moves but I couldn't find any way of making them work.  I felt I was getting nowhere slowly ...
