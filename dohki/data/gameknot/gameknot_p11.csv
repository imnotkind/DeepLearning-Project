It involved mating with the Knight, and the only way to drive it off would've been with the Bishop which is exactly what happened.  He then said that the best continuation was to exchange the Knight for Bishop.  I agree with this because Grandmaster Susan Polgar implied that, in general, Bishops are favorable over Knights.  That's when she gave advise not to exchange without a good reason, Susan was, specifically, talking about Bishop for Knight.

I did promise you a return to another mating attack, but before I could annotate that one, this game finished on me.  I was facing Class A opposition in this game.  In this MT I drew my game with Rex with the black pieces and here is the return leg with me with the white pieces. The endgame became a same colour bishop ending and evolved into a K&P ending.  I feel this is also worthy of endgame study.  Did Henry come out trumps or did he end up in the Zugzwang?

This is the game that I promised to show you which starts off as another Reti Opening.  In the middlegame one player sees the opportunity to attack, firstly by a pawn storm, then sacrificing a piece for two pawns and then a queen joins in the fun, but which queen, is it the black queen or is it Glenda?  To find out you will just have to read on.  Here is the GA analysis. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=27160383&rnd=0.5152885048607565"

Qc7 MATE!! - Yup, the BK now feels the deadly white heat of Glenda and is given The Kiss of Death (this is what this type of support mate is sometimes known as). This is Glenda's dream role, to be delivering checkmate at close range (I can think of nothing more empowering than that) and not defending pawns, vital though that role is, and getting bogged down by passivitis into the bargain.  Sadly, Glenda will never now be able to do that to Freddy the Master Mater (Easy 19) as he has now quit gameknot to pursue a walking career.  Still, there are lots of other big fish in Gameknot's sea that Glenda may prevail against and I must hold on to that belief as I continue my career of being Club Founder of Walking the Walk and Learning to Run.  In every game, no matter how passive I may get, I will always be on the lookout for ways to go for the jugular and nail my opponent's king.  Kind regards - Joanne"

Here is another knight endgame and this is going to be quite a marathon.  70 moves are to be played in this one.  Here is the gameknot analysis -enjoy!  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=26564274&fb=1&rnd=0.24557254462093247"
1113,32,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',2. Bc4 - in response to a double king pawn opening we have the Bishop's Opening.
1114,32,2,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',4. .... Nf6 - both players bring out their pieces quickly.

Maybe I could provoke a few weaknesses in white's castled position and that h3 pawn could suddenly become vulnerable if I can put my knight on f4 like I did in the Chorba game two annotations ago.  That game ended with Chorba copping Old Matey.
1120,32,8,Nf4,b'4rrk1/bpp2pp1/p2pqn1p/4p3/PP2Pn2/2PP1N1P/1BQN1PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',18. .... Nf4 - nacht.

1129,32,17,Kg7,b'4n3/1pp3k1/p2p1p2/3P3p/PPP5/8/6K1/2B5 w - -',41. Kg7 - we are now in a N v B endgame with me 2 pawns up but with still some work to do.
1130,32,18,b6,b'4n3/B1p5/pp1p2k1/3P1p1p/PPP5/5K2/8/8 w - -',44. .... b6 - trying to trap the white bishop but alas it does not succeed.

1134,32,22,Kf5,b'8/2p5/p2p4/P2P1k1p/2P2p1B/3n1K2/8/8 w - -',53. ..... Kf5 - white chooses to keep the pieces on.  Henry now gives my passed pawn on f5 some support.
1135,32,23,5Bxc7,b'8/2B5/p2p4/P2P1k1p/2n2p2/8/4K3/8 b - -',56. .... Bxc7 - now the c pawns are traded off.  Henry is also eyeing up a white p(r)awn on d5.  I must remind you that prawns are Henry's special dish no matter on what platter and how they are served up.
1136,32,24,Nxd5+,b'8/8/p2k4/P2n3p/5K2/8/8/8 w - -',"59. ..... Nxd5+ - the white bishop is sacrificed to try and prevent my pawns reaching Glendadom.  However, there are still two black pawns on the board and only one white one.  I also have an extra piece."

El ajedrecista es como un albañil que tiene que construir puntos fuertes dentro de la estructura del adversario desde donde amenace el adversario. Entonces que elementos de construcción tenemos. Diagonales, que la hacen los alfiles, Columnas, que las hacen las torres, Vigas o filas, que las hacen las torres. Remaches, que los hacen los caballos y los peones. La dama tiene varias propiedades y el rey todas las debilidades. Una diagonal de peones fortalece la diagonal que ocupa y deja debilitada la diagonal que no ocupa. Dos peones en el centro fortalecen las cuatro casillas sobre las que influencian y debilitan las dos casillas de los costados. Dejamos un punto debil cuando hay un peon atrasado y uno adelantado. El punto debil esta en el costado del peon adelantado y el frente del peon atrasado. Entonces desde ese punto domina la situacion la pieza que pongamos. Es un lugar para ocupar, donde no puede ser desalojada la pieza. Pero eso solo no hace ganar la partida. hay que ver el concepto y el modo de usarlo. las diagonales o columnas o filas que dominan las otras piezas se pueden obstruir con una pieza nuestra que este defendida. También se puede desviar las piezas contrarias.
