1,0,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"I was wondering how Jack would respond to the Ruy Lopez.  He usually plays 3...d6  But 3...Bc5?! has also been played.  Important to note that if he did that I'd answer with 4.c3 and would continue with 5.d4 because it's about gain of tempo and solid pawn chain as reversion told me.  Meanwhile Jack said ""I'll play it safe I don't trust you.""  I understand this very well as the idea is ""Don't trust your opponent.""  Because he played the most common move I'm going to stick to mainlines.  I can deviate but I feel that unlike with nuntar Jack knows too much if I play 4.Nc3 so likewise I don't trust him either.  Therefore unlike the training session with John for me delaying castling was not an option in the context of this position.  If I didn't know Jack as well things would likely be different due to my training game with John. "
2,0,2,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -', Jack: You castled already?  Joe: Yes.  Jack: Very good.

7,0,7,Bd7,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Therefore I said I figured you'd play that.  As now I have an answer to that.

But I kept in mind what Susan Polgar told me when teaching about the French Defense and combined it with the longest game that I annotated with tactical-abyss since that same variation came up.  Therefore I kick his N as the idea is that I have a solid pawn chain and gain tempo.  After the attack Jack said ""You're coming.  Allrighty that's allowed.""  "
9,0,9,Nb8,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbppp/3p1n2/1B1Pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I was very surprised to see this played.  I anticipated the exchange variation with 7...Nd4  But this undevelops.  Although I stopped thinking this way the thought reoccured with this move.  It appears that Jack just waisted time with this move and now I believe that I have an advantage which I'll attempt to exploit.
10,0,10,Bc4,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I considered completing my development.  But this is where I abandoned the chess quotes for now.  Though it doesn't happen so much here in OTB chess there's not much choice due not having analyze the board or enough time to visualize.  Instead pulling out the chess bits and wisdom is the best way to guide my play in this circumstance.  It however isn't needed here.  bringing my Bc1 into play would've allowed Jack to exchange.  Normally I don't mind early exchanges.  The problem however is that it's a bad idea in this position because it gives his Nb8 a good outpost.  And I want to keep Mr. Stockel's options limited.

Although it's a different move order and not a transposition this is still a common theme in the Ruy Lopez.  The idea is driving the white's LSB back which Jack did.

Here's my thought process.  I don't lose anything after 10...a5 but I didn't want to chance it or be caught in a difficult situation.

And my belief is that retreating will give me an edge for when Jack does I feel more optimisitic about my position.  So this is what I want.  I'm focusing on a little more then just the small stuff because of what comes after his retreat.

So by attacking his Rook and forcing him to waist tempo I was able to prevent the pin.  Afterall based on past experience and against someone of this strength despite not being serious yet make no mistake that an absolute pin of that sort would give him an edge.  The idea being is that they do become dangerous as I learned in the pinning motif where he had two pins that I failed to break in one move and lost shortly after.  Then something similar happened against one of my students followed by Wizard Chess.  The idea is to prevent history from repeating itself.

But unlike before that does not bother me as I break it and attack him.  Therefore I'm proud of myself as it shows that I've learned from my mistakes in terms of how dangerous those pins are.  Jack implied something similar because when I broke it he said ""Very good."""

As now both of my Knights are better placed.  And despite material being even I feel that my advantage has grown.  Now it's possible that I'm overly confident with the position and acting like I understand more then I actually know.  But I'd rather do this and be too confident then nervous.  In that past I've been nervous and was corrected by Jack which I then emphasized to my students of not getting worried.  In doing so and situations like this I'm one extreme end or the other (not in the middle.)   That is too anxious or overly confident.  I'd rather be positive then anxious.  And with it I'm not afraid of what Mr. Stockel might do for now.  The idea is as Susan also mentioned to have fun which is what's happening.  In fact bhidragon when he noted that in our rated game.  In explaining that he was interested in how I'm playing these days he also said ""Let's have fun.""  Well that's my attitude here."

I considered a move that anyonelse wouldn't have even thought about (that is a more experienced player.)  But I didn't for the same reason.  The move I was thinking of was 17.Na5?? to attack his Rook and gain tempo.  The good part is that I didn't need the analyze the board to see the threat of 17...Qxa5  Sounds easy but in reality it was an equivalent to a Homework assignment of a different form since this was nearly overlooked.

However he misses move that one would not generally expect from a coach.  But I understand him too well and the actual reason is due to his glacoma.  That would cause anyone to miss something like that despite touching pieces which you see in blindfolded chess.  Jack has some qualities of that.

If he takes my c6 I'd pin with 19.Bb5.  However this is wrong because his a6 prevents me from doing that.  Yet I told Jack why I thought it was good before overlooking it.  And he said ""If you say that 18.Na5 is good I believe you."""

I thought that attacking with Bb6 would win the Rook but Jack defends.  Yet I'll play it anyhow since he can now strengthen his Nb8 which I don't want to allow.
26,0,26,Rxc6,b'1nq1k2r/4bppp/pBrp1nb1/N3p3/1p2P3/3B1PN1/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w k -',?? Up to my surprise Jack played this.  But I also understand the reason behind this blunder and realize that his glacoma is the reason behind capturing with the Rook.  He feels these things and chances are more then likely that he mixed the two up and thought that this was the Knight.  With that being said I anticipated 19...Nxc6 after which it's even.  I think I'd have a small advantage still but with this move the advantage is much bigger since I win a Rook for Knight.  At this point while I might not be successful due to how much stronger he is I'll strive for a win.

Another reason for not doing so earlier is that I used to develop my Queen once everything else was developed.  I only do so in extenuating it's believed to be an extenuating circumstance these days.  It's important to be careful as it's how I went wrong against reversion.  But Jack said that the Queen should be brought out much later on when it absolutely needs to be and not just because development is complete.  And that's due to how fragile the most powerful piece is early on.
29,0,29,2Qb7,b'4k2r/1q2bppp/pBnp1nb1/4p3/1p2P3/3B1PN1/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w k -',Not surprisingly however Jack protects.  I almost captured anyhow but saw that my Bb6 is attacked.  So I'll retreat as the threat will be renewed.
30,0,30,a5,b'4k2r/1q2bppp/2np1nb1/p3p3/1p2P3/3BBPN1/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w k -',I'm also not surprised that Jack felt it and defends.  I don't think he saw with the same issues but when feeling despite the mistakes including this Mr. Stockel generally plays the right move.  Remember: that when he feels things it's an equivalent to playing blindfold chess.  I know this because when they don't see the moves (the GM's they feel.)  And I've seen examples from the Polgar Sisters.
31,0,31,2Ba6,b'4k2r/1q2bppp/B1np1nb1/p3p3/1p2P3/4BPN1/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b k -',"So I come up with a different idea.  The is to attack his Queen.  That's because as I learned about with the book ""Chess Tactics for Champions"" it's about ""Deflection and Removing the Guard.""  His a6 prevented the move but since I have the opportunity my decision was made to go for it.  The idea is to exploit the weakness to enable the nasty pin on his Nc6.  When Jack breaks it I'll liquidate since I'm ahead."

So when we exchange Jack will win back a pawn.  Much better was 28.Rac1.  After that he might not allow it since 29...Bh5 is a possibility.  But if he takes or doesn't move it then I'd be successful liquidating.
35,0,35,3Rab1,b'6k1/4bppp/3p1n2/p3pP2/1p6/4BP2/PPr3PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Learning from the previous mistake I prevent him leveling out.  I also could've protected with Be3 but didn't want to undevelop as everything that happened earlier with getting pieces would've appeared to be nothing.  And I don't like waisting time for no reason.

Knowing that a win is most likely not possible my new goal is to go for a draw.  Yet if were to offer one (which I have before) he'd decline and would say that it must be played out first.  This is why that offer did not occur.
42,0,42,3d4,b'6k1/4bpp1/5n1p/B3pP2/pp1p4/5P2/PPr3PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',In addition to what I mentioned there's a also a problem which is his passed pawn.

After watching about pawn chains from tactical-abyss a similar position occurred.  And what it makes me realize is that this is one of those times where they are especially useful.  Might seem useful but we're in the endgame and one can promote.  In fact this will happen when I start blundering and we're not too far away.

Afterall in the long run I don't care about winning or losing.  In the end the goal is to learn and making a mistake is how you do this.  With that Jack sacced his Be7 for my a3 in order to push his passer since ""Passed pawns must be pushed."""
50,0,50,b2,b'6k1/3n2p1/5p1p/B3pP2/p2p2R1/P4P2/1pr3PP/1R4K1 w - -',This is where I start to become a little anxious yet I'm also thinking about what to do as opposed to letting my nerves take over.
51,0,51,3Bb4,b'6k1/3n2p1/5p1p/4pP2/pB1p2R1/P4P2/1pr3PP/1R4K1 b - -',?? So I decide to protect a3 to prevent 39...Nb6.  But this is where seeing the overall picture becomes essential.  As it turns out however Jack rightly pointed that this is the losing blunder.  39.Be1 was the only way to save this position so it was forced.  After the game we discussed this and why he called 37.Rg4? as mistake.  He said that best was to double up with 37.Ree1.  He was little upset that I moved it to Rg4 because somewhat similar to what bhidragon told me Jack said something for years which I forgot.  Mr. Stockel told me that the general goal is to bring both Rooks on one file.  Even if not you want to keep together.  By isolating one on g4 and got myself in trouble.  We went over variations as to what would've had I played the right but why isolating the Rooks got me in trouble.  So let's say I made the right choice and played 39.Be1 his next move would've been 39...Rc1+ now the only thing that holds is 40.Rxb2 (as 40.Rxc1?? allows him to promote and the game is over.)  But after capturing on b2 Jack would answer with 40...Rxe1+  Before analyzing I agreed that I would've lost a piece but it's better then allowing what's about to come which is a promotion.  However had I doubled up in the center this wouldn't have happened.  Well after analyzing I discovered that after 40...Rxe1+ not only haven't I lost anything but I'm still a pawn up.  With this being played white is busted no matter how you look at it as he will Queen.
52,0,52,4Kf2,b'6k1/3n2p1/5p1p/4pP2/pB1p2R1/P4P2/1p3KPP/1Rr5 b - -',?? But I figured that I've stopped the promotion with this move.  My thought process based on some passed games was that giving up my Rook prevented his b2 from advancing behind it.  However the other idea is that a Rook should remain behind the passer.  So with that being said not only was there no way to stop it but this move also loses a Rook.  Therefore it is resignable as there are no good moves left.  But I don't resign yet because of the way I thought which appeared to be his inability to promote.
53,0,53,b1=Q,b'8/3n1kp1/5p1p/4pP2/p2p2R1/P4P2/5KPP/1q1rB3 w - -',"After Jack Queens however we both agreed on resignation.  For one thing in addition to what I mentioned resignation generally didn't happen until mate could be forced since easy19 continued that game where I resigned before mate was proven.  But after showing my loss against reversion he did not question it so things have changed.  And in this position I figured that mate was soon to follow after 44...Qc2+ but after getting out of check it'd still take longer.  What can be agreed on however is that there is nothing else to learn here.  Right after this game was finished and in the Men's Room while we were saying goodbye to each other for the week the game was discussed with two things learned.  But one of the things he said (which is the more important) is the moral of the game.  First in general you should keep the Rooks together as opposed to seperating them.  He said that I got myself in trouble by isolating both rooks.  In general that's true but after analyzing it here I realized that it's not in the context of this game.  Because after those variations I still have a manageable position.  Second but more importantly (the lesson) is to slow down in the endgame.  In it he said that I could sometimes wiggle my way out of a mistake in the midgame.  But in the endgame however one mistake will often make or break it.  This makes sense to me because as shamash put it ""The endgame is your ability to play chess.""  I can relate to that due to what I studied in understanding how to mate with your Knight and Bishop.  For one thing you must play accurately in the N+B+K mate to win.  If you blunder it will most likely end in a draw.  This happened to me for months before becoming second nature.  Second during that time in the second to fourth times that I retook the quiz after failing the first time I still didn't pass due to moving too quickly.  It took time before realizing that I had to slow down in order to become familiar with the concepts.  In doing so things started making sense and I was able to pass the quiz understand the fundamentals and use it to explain in previous annotations.  Well the same thing is true in endgames like this because you must go slower and concentrate more then the middle game to hold the position and even win.  Failing to do so is what led to my downfall."

174,3,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He plays something I'm used to.
175,3,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In the future I'll allow a stronger opponent to play the Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano.  But reversion to make a long story short advised me to try different defenses in this tourney since the idea is learning.  One thing he mentioned was the Petrov Defense.  And after seeing it's starting position in tipsyjourneyman's mini tourney which I regretfully had to decline (in order to avoid being put at too many games more then 6 at one time.)  However this was the position and I have a little basics in it because the first defense I played against there was this defense.  At the time I didn't know it was called that but had bad luck with it.  Times however have changed and as I became stronger I cope with things better.  That even includes things against something against Caro Kann which elyhim annotated.
176,3,2,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I figured that he played this to open up the center as you do with the Philidor's or French or Caro Kann.  In general 1...e6 is played.  Maybe he wanted to follow the same logic.
177,3,3,exd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Already starting to get distracted about the vacation combined with knabbing a pawn early I took.  Better however was 3...Nc6 because of his next move.  The idea being that his next move as we often see in the French Defense can be of bad omen.  The position still holds but I don't like having to deal with it. 
178,3,4,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I figured that this move would prevent the loss of tempo.  I also beared in mind that he can't win my Nf6 as his e5 is now pinned.  Being hyperfocused on General Openings would've resulted in the loss of time.  But one thing I did remember was not to focus on chess terms or bits and wisdom.  That's how I found this move.
179,3,5,Be2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/3p4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But I overlooked this move as the pin is now broken.  And with it my Knight is now attacked.
180,3,6,Ng8,b'rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4P3/3p4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"?! It appears that any other move would've lost my Knight.  This is where that distraction however starts to become ugly.  Instead of calculating I assumed.  So this means the failure to access the position which as he also noted especially with the training is vital.  And that's why I'm frustrated.  Usually I don't just forget things like that.  And in general it's prevented.  The only reason for this failure was out of an unusual ""Fight or Flight"" situation which as unbermensch43 noted followed by me telling some of my students chess is not supposed to be that way.  But it happened here.  Now for some more thought process I know how it happened as things like this have become reality.  And it believe it or not occured here.  It was the fear of losing too much sleep.  It ended minimally better then expected.  With that being said my worry was that I wouldn't get more then 6 hours of sleep which would make me tired.  I actually got 15 minutes more then that and lasted a little longer then expected.  But about 2 hours after landing I was exhausted.  My worst fear did not come true which was not being able to study a book by GM Susan Polgar called ""Chess Tactics for Champions"" due to my fatigue.  Better was 5...Ng4 but the assumption was that after he gives a discovered attack by moving his Nf3 I would not have been able to protect my N.  What didn't come into calculation was 6...Nh6 and now taking would be to my benefit since his Bc8 is stronger.  Calculating better and doing my Homework here would've made the situation better."
181,3,7,O-O,b'rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4P3/3p4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So after that error which hindered my K side he takes advantage by castling.
182,3,8,Nc6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/3p4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I try to come with a plan.  The idea is sooner or later castling Q side which he'll prevent.

My plan is actually unsound and easy to drive off.  Not to my surprise it doesn't work.  With that being said here's the thought process.  The idea here 8...Nb4 followed by 9...Qxc2  Usually I don't play like this but as noted in the intro and for the same reason it was a rough weak.  Particularly less then 4 days before going away.
185,3,11,c3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2q1P3/3p4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',And this is how he stops that plan.  The idea being that for the obvious reason I can't move my Nc6-b4.

188,3,14,Nxe5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/2q1n3/8/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',?? I was much more distracted then before.  Stopping the game and trying to come back would not have worked since this distraction happened for the rest of the week leading to as noted close to a fatal mistake two days prior.  Without calculating (which is unheard of for me these days) I got greedy and took his pawn.  Had I paid better attention and not been distracted this would not have come close to consideration as now I'm losing a piece in return.  I'm not sure what the best move but had I been more alert 9...d6 would've been played instead with the idea of getting my Bc8 out and castling at once.
189,3,15,Bd6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/2q1N3/8/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Without giving it much thought as noted this was played to try and intimidate this runner.  I figured that I'd get something out of it.  I knew that he'd retreat but the joke is on me (as the saying goes).  That's because I'm about to be punished when he reattacks.
190,3,16,Qa5,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/q7/8/2NN4/PP2BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Going for just about anything I decide to pin his N.  This time however I anticipated his next move.  That's because my initial thought was that 12.b4? because of what I play which is the fatal mistake.
191,3,17,Bxb4,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/q7/1b6/2NN4/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',?? Had I given this more thought and done my HW I would've calculated better.  Therefore I would've retreated my Queen (which is what should've been done)  But this however is where the distraction was the worst as now aside from that thought (which was wrong) I was not with it.  What matters is that I should not have taken.  It was a case of not playing a move just because it looks good which I've taught my students.  But it's not obvious because it was more then just looking good.  It also boiled down to planning the necessary ways to reduce the sleep deprivation issue as opposed to what the threat.  In doing so unlike what was discussed I ignored the only way of saving the position as now I'm busted.  Yes I don't lose a piece on the next move shortly there after he is going to win my Queen at the least.  But instead of taking right away he plays other moves that are even more powerful.  In doing so he will force a win quickly.
192,3,18,1Nd5,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/3N4/1q6/8/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',This is where the trouble starts but I did not know to what extent.  I didn't think it was too bad and figured that my Queen was protected.  But after 15.Bf4 is played that's when I start to realize it.  Despite that however I thought I was still fine until 16.Bb5+  And that's when everything changed realizing the extent. 
193,3,19,Qe6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/4q3/1B1N4/5B2/8/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',At the very least he would win my Queen.  
194,3,20,1Nxc7+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppNp1ppp/4q3/1B6/5B2/8/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',In fact oddlord could've done that with 17.Rxe6 (since my Queen is pinned.)  Not doing this means that I'm in worse shape then I could've imagined.  In fact it also implies that I'm lost immediately since because they only let one keep the Queen when a mate is inevitable.  Even with best play I would not have spotted it in this position.  But chess is a language and realizing that is now a good way to learn in case I ever have something like this but on the other end. (That is if this happened and have a mate which I'd try to take advantage of.)
195,3,21,Qxd6,b'r1b3nr/ppNp1ppp/3q1k2/8/5B2/3B4/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',This is where the distraction ends and I pay attention.  In fact I'm almost completely aware of what's happening and the vacation is not getting to me at this point.  But it's too little too late.  I didn't play this for the thrills and giggles of winning the Queen.  Instead I figured that oddlord would mate with his Queen and Nc6.  So playing this was the only way to save the position.  In other words this is where I thought that the worst was over.  But after the game was over I analyzed and no matter what I would've played it was over with his next move because this is a mating net which is also why he did not take my Queen.
196,3,22,2Ne8#,b'r1b1N1nr/pp1p1ppp/3q1k2/8/5B2/3B4/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',"And what I learned is that like with big storms or meetings as with any schedule don't think about it too much.  In other words it's good to plan things out in advance but don't let it distract you.  Instead of having that as the first thing on your mind it's better to put it aside and focus on chess first.  This means that concentrating on what's important such as the threat and how to save the position should be the first thing on one's mind.  Then when you're not on the chessboard or at work that's when it becomes appropriate to think about planning the vacation.  Therefore it is a perfect example on how thought process plays a role and where they must be changed.  So as a way for me to remember and change the way I'm thinking: there is always a time and place to do it.  And when it's not that time it should be put aside until appropriate.  Therefore the moral is as was (before I started playing chess) to think about ""the here and now""."

Again brett is a fine playerbut my constructive opinon(not destructive opinion)is that brett enjoys blitz and probably defeats many blitz opponents south of 2100(like I do)but needs additional blitz training that he lacks when confronted by a hyper severe electrical storm like me....and he has no proper grounding in blitz theorywhich is ""different""than long corresp. game play theory.No brag on my partjust fact....FYI.""

329,9,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Hmm my opponent throws me off guard here. This is the first time I would encounter this opening I guess
330,9,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So I grab a share of the centre with this pawn thrust
331,9,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The logical follow-up to his previous move I guess

336,9,8,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A good developing move to deal with my opponent threat

The removal of this LSB might cause serious weakness for black along the light squares but since white also dosent have a LSB black can breath a sigh of relief for the mean time

351,9,23,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1npB/4n3/3NP3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/2KRR3 w - -',My opponent starts playing lazily from around here. He needs to come up with an attacking strategy before I complete my own attack
352,9,24,1Bxg7,b'r2q1rk1/p3ppBp/1p1p1np1/4n3/3NP3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/2KRR3 b - -',This capture was made for the sole purpose of removing a very important defender of his castled position. I silently hoped my opponent would play something like Nc4 thinking he would gain time for the attack on my queen but alas my oppenent recaptured immediately
353,9,25,1Kxg7,b'r2q1r2/p3ppkp/1p1p1np1/4n3/3NP3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/2KRR3 w - -',Of course!

356,9,28,1Qe2,b'r2q1r2/p3ppkp/1p1p1np1/8/2nNPP2/2N4P/PPP1Q1P1/2KRR3 b - -',Here comes the important queen repositioning. The queen would support my h-pawn push to h5 if need be
357,9,29,1Na5,b'r2q1r2/p3ppkp/1p1p1np1/n7/3NPP2/2N4P/PPP1Q1P1/2KRR3 w - -',My opponents knight continue to hop around the board. Notice how it went from e5 to c4 and now to a5 without achieving anything

360,9,32,1h4,b'2rq1r2/p3ppkp/1p1p1np1/n7/3NPPPP/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 b - -',I played this move to later play h5 which would force lines to be opened for attack on the black king
361,9,33,1h5,b'2rq1r2/p3ppk1/1p1p1np1/n6p/3NPPPP/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 w - h6',?? Instead of opening lines towards the white king my opponents forces lines to be opened towards his own king
362,9,34,1gxh5,b'2rq1r2/p3ppk1/1p1p1np1/n6P/3NPP1P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 b - -',And so I accept my opponent hospitality
363,9,35,1Nxh5,b'2rq1r2/p3ppk1/1p1p2p1/n6n/3NPP1P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 w - -',My opponent is now simply trying to contain the situation which is fast becoming worse for him with each passing move.. My opponent correctly senses the danger of completely opening up the g-file
364,9,36,1f5,b'2rq1r2/p3ppk1/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP2P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 b - -',I didn't want to slow down the pace of the game by defending the pawn while it was at f4. This move simply forces more lines to be opened towards the black king. (Note that black cannot play gxf5 or Qxh5 would be devastating
365,9,37,1Qd7,b'2r2r2/p2qppk1/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP2P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KRR3 w - -',?? My opponent continues with his lazy play. He needed to get his king off the g-file at once. 
366,9,38,2Reg1,b'2r2r2/p2qppk1/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP2P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KR2R1 b - -',!! Very solid... The immediate threat is Qxh5 and black can't play gxh5 as the g-pawn is pinned. This move also brings a major piece into play
367,9,39,2Rxc3,b'5r2/p2qppk1/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP2P/2r5/PPP1Q3/2KR2R1 w - -',???? Here my opponent decides to sacrifice the exchange for no reason. Notice that my c3 knight wasn't doing anything anyway. Instead of this move he should have played something like Rh8
368,9,40,2bxc3,b'5r2/p2qppk1/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP2P/2P5/P1P1Q3/2KR2R1 b - -',Here I thought about ignoring the rook and instead play Qxh5. Instead I took a break from the attack and snacked on the juicy rook

370,9,42,2Qg4,b'5r2/p2qpp1k/1p1p2p1/n4P1n/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 b - -',!!!  And of course I press the initiative. I threating to win the black queen with fxg6+... The black knight is also in danger of being lost if care isn't taken
371,9,43,2Nf6,b'5r2/p2qpp1k/1p1p1np1/n4P2/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 w - -',Its exactly after this move I spot a forced checkmate. 
372,9,44,2fxg6+,b'5r2/p2qpp1k/1p1p1nP1/n7/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 b - -',!! The first move in the forced mate sequence.. Of the 5 options (Kg8Kg7Kh8Kh6 and fxg6) available to get out of check none actually saves black from mate as we would soon find out
373,9,45,2Kh8,b'5r1k/p2qpp2/1p1p1nP1/n7/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 w - -',If fxg6 then (Qxg6+ Kh8 Qg7#) if Kh6 then [Qg5+ Kg7 gxf7+ (kxf7 Qg6#)(Kh8 Qg7#)(Kh7 Qg7#)] if Kg7 or Kg8 then (gxf7+ and mate follows) 
374,9,46,2g7+,b'5r1k/p2qppP1/1p1p1n2/n7/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 b - -',The correct followup. Any other move won't be as effective
375,9,47,2Kg8,b'5rk1/p2qppP1/1p1p1n2/n7/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 w - -',If Kh7 then gxf8=N+(Kh8 Qg7#) or (Kh6 Qg5#)

377,9,49,2Kxf8,b'5k2/p2qpp2/1p1p1n2/n7/3NP1QP/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 w - -',Black only prolongs his suffering
378,9,50,2Qg7+,b'5k2/p2qppQ1/1p1p1n2/n7/3NP2P/2P5/P1P5/2KR2R1 b - -',!! Of course I still keep the initiative and don't give any of black's remaining pieces a chance to interfere in my attack. It was at this point my opponent resigned. The game would have continued thus (Qg7+ Ke8 Qh8+ Ng8 Qxg8#). It was a wonderful game on my part and many thanks to all4nc for playing I hope you enjoyed the game as this is my first annotation.. Many thanks and please rate the game...
379,10,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Trying to surprise the opponent. Although it may look like a king´s gambit it does not allow for such development. White clearly opens against his rival king´s side giving up the center and can result in a weakened white´s position. And yes I have no idea how to play this properly and that is one of the fun things of blitz game. A challenge of ideas will develop from both sides. Hope you enjoy it.
380,10,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black prevents white from doing 2.e4 and therefore set a strong pawn on d4 gaining control of the center.
381,10,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Choosing a financhetto defense. This may be giving white some time to regain control but at the same time positions BSB on a very strong diagonal a1-h8.
382,10,3,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Allows for WSB to develo. White could have also played g3 with oppossing mirror defence set up but thought to set his bishop on a far more active position later on (in spite of leaving his king side weakened)
383,10,4,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Blocks the pressure of the BSB on b2 and allows for a development there for white trying to trade both bishops.
384,10,5,Nh6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6pn/3p4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"Interesting. Black may be aiming to do f5 and therefore place a strong pressure on e4 although that would also weaken his ""e"" pawn."
385,10,6,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6pn/3p4/5P2/2NBPN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"This seem to be a bad movement  since it blocks ""d"" advance. But BSB will go to b2 in the next moves keeping with the idea of giving up the center while pressuring the side. See that in a potential situation ""h"" advance will be a strong push there (in case white goes for a long castling)"
386,10,7,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3pn/3p4/5P2/2NBPN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now this seems to be too slow for black and also doesn´t help Nb8 and Bc8 future development. Since d5 seems to be perfectly fine Nc6 seems more natural.
387,10,8,Nf5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Again not helping much to the cause of black since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. Now considering its activity on h6 black may be wanting to activate this N but at the cost of several movements.
388,10,9,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/5P2/1PNBPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',So now white is facing an interesting dilema. I thought about going for a queen castling and the push on BK defences or play safe and go for a short castling.
389,10,10,Na4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/N4P2/1P1BPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQ -', Whit this white is almost giving up on the long castling. Too many moves to go allowing black to advance on a-b-c files. A race I wouldn´t like to run second. Now I felt tempted to do this move since black almost has to go for the trade or else going weak on his castling.
390,10,11,Nd6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Again a slow move. Maybe white can still do the aforementioned attack idea.
391,10,12,1O-O,b'rnbq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But I didn´t. I still have the feeling is a weak move. Now the push has to go with less firepower going for something like h3-g4-f5...which can be clearly stopped with f5. Also black has a very strong jump point on e4.
392,10,13,1Nd7,b'r1bq1r2/pp1nppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Mobilizing his forces. Again control of the centre is the order of the day for black. Maybe with ...f6 e5.
393,10,14,1Nc3,b'r1bq1r2/pp1nppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Calling back forces.
394,10,15,1Nf6,b'r1bq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn1np1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This blocks the previously mentioned idea but sets a very strong N on e4.
395,10,16,1h3,b'r1bq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn1np1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN1P/P1PP2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Preparing the g4-f5 advance. White might have also thought about Qe2 and a future e4 advance but I had this fixation on the pawn advance as the only chance to get something positive out of this situation.
396,10,17,1h5,b'r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn1np1/3p3p/5P2/1PNBPN1P/P1PP2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - h6',"It seems to weaken black´s defence. It kept me thinking about a potential sacrifice on h5 but is unclear. And black may also find attractive the possibility to mobilize forces on the ""h"" file with Rh8 and so on."
397,10,18,1Ne2,b'r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn1np1/3p3p/5P2/1P1BPN1P/P1PPN1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Again trying to stack forces on the attack. No real threat yet though.
398,10,19,1Nfe4,b'r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn2p1/3p3p/4nP2/1P1BPN1P/P1PPN1P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',See the strong point e4 offers black. But in case of ...f5 Ne5 will give white another one and g6 (and maybe even the mentioned h5 sacrifice) would be weaken spots.
399,10,20,e6,b'r1bq1r2/pp3pk1/2pnp1p1/3p3p/4nP2/1P1BPN1P/P1PPN1P1/R3QRK1 w - -',Maybe a mistake. Blocks WSB action and does not help with the counterattack black is supposed to be doing at the center although it keeps white from doing Nh4 comfortably.
400,10,21,1Qxg3,b'r1bq1r2/pp3pk1/2pnp1p1/3p3p/5P2/1P1BPNQP/P1PP2P1/R4RK1 b - -',I had the feeling that I was simplifying the position without a gain.
401,10,22,dxe4,b'r1bq1r2/pp3pk1/2p1p1p1/7p/4pP2/1P2PNQP/P1PP2P1/R4RK1 w - -',Now I saw that I was giving up a pawn but in exchange white seems to have some attack (to be demonstrated though)
402,10,23,Qxd2,b'r1b2r2/pp3pk1/2p1p1p1/6Np/4pP2/1P2P1QP/P1Pq2P1/R4RK1 w - -',And black accepts the exchange of blows.
403,10,24,Qxc2,b'r1b2r2/pp3pk1/2p1p1p1/7p/4NP2/1P2P1QP/P1q3P1/R4RK1 w - -',This positing consumed most of my scarce time. I had the feeling that controling the a1-h8 with the queen would be vital but did not see how to gain it yet.
404,10,25,2Qf3,b'r1b2r2/pp3pk1/2p1p1p1/7p/4NP2/1P2PQ1P/P1q3P1/R4RK1 b - -',Now I did see the next moves and how BQ if not careful will be removed from her king´s defence as it happened.

You can see that the queen is sort of trapped cannot go anywhere near the king nor control the centre. Now what took me most of my thoughts while black was deciding what to do was 20...f5 a weakening movement maybe but also giving black some time to activate his pieces. On that side look how poorly is BB performing.

BQ cannot become active by giving some checks but still could come to the defence with Qb5. I´ve just realized that if black had played 22...Qb5 instead of ...Qa6 this wouldn´t have been possible.

472,13,14,2Qa7,b'4k2r/Q2nnpp1/p7/7p/4BP2/3P2P1/PB5P/RN2K1R1 b Qk -',Black will need to play Kd8 to protect the remaining rook from the queen.  Nc8 might also work.  Either way black will probably play BxPg7.  But the pawn will prove cheaper than the rook.

475,14,0,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3',?! Remembering those private annotations combined with what I previously taught my students I said I'm not sure why you played this but it's said to be a wing pawn. A wing pawn is a pawn at the end file. In general however it's preferred to develop so either a central pawn which is one the e or d file or develop a minor piece (The Knight or Bishop). The goal is to develop get the King to safety (castle) and control the center which is right in the center of the board. Advancing the wing pawn doesn't do that.  
476,14,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So I go with my mainline what how I respond when my students play 1.h4.
477,14,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Now he starts the first process as this is a center pawn as noted which opens up a line for his Bf1.
478,14,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Meanwhile I continue with my development.
479,14,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',So does Magnus.  But I said ? It's good that you remembered my advice about developing pieces. But an important thing to learn is that there are exceptions to the General Opening Priniciples. Sometimes you've got to deviate. This happens when a piece or pawn are en-prise (unprotected). The problem is that this move is going to lose a pawn. Better was 3.Nc3 3.f3 d3 or 3.Qe2. 3.Nc3 is I think the best move as not only do your protect but at the same time a different piece has been developed.  This time however I admit to being wrong.  In this context I was coming up with a bunch of variations as to how I won a pawn.  It's important to note that although I abhor it in the past I've occassionally given my students the wrong information.  I'd go into variations but not enough.  So that I wasn't calculating enough.  This was espeically noticeable in one of their annotations.  In fact it's one of the reasons why one of them got deleted due to having been corrected so many times.  This time I did the opposite and calculated too much which to my surprise lead to an inaccuracy since he gets the pawn back.  The lesson I learned is knowing the happy medium when providing the student with variations.  If you don't do enough there are other things that I've missed.  But too much and there's something that I miscalculated.
480,14,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n2P/5N2/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',It actually starts off with this move.  Now this game including the move played happened before receiving advise from bhidragon.  In fact it was before my first game against oddlord.  So I hyperfocused on those chess terms as opposed to thinking about the context of the game and seeing the big picture.  That means thinking about what the board is telling me.  Although it wasn't as bad this game make no mistake that it led to some losses.  And after being told what's needed to improve even more I gave some of that information to Magnus since I noticed similarities as we'll see later on.
481,14,6,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1n2P/5N2/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Although I'm still a little hyperfocused on those terms or as we call chess quotes I play this.  But in this position there was more to it.  The other idea behind this is that I have threats against his Rh1 as the danger is with my bishop aligned a Knight fork which would win a Rook.
482,14,7,Nxe5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1N3/2B1n2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And this is where he wins back the pawn.  But there's more to it then meets the eye.  Magnus is also threatening a fork.
483,14,8,Qf6,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1N3/2B1n2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Believe it or not this move happened at about the same time that I recieved that advice.  Otherwise I would've been hyperfocused on bringing my Nb6 into play.  Right after he told me how to change my thought process I considered 5...Qe7 with the idea that if he were to take on f7 I'd take back.  The problem is that this would lose my Queen.  So while analyzing that also changed.  I was really thinking about what to do.  The reason behind this move is due to the added threat on f2.  In addition should Magnus play 6.Nxf7 I'll respond by castling or playing 6.Rf8 to create a threat against his Knight.  In fact he'd be forced to give up his Rook to avoid mate as 6.f3 is the only thing that would refute me from playing 6...Qxf2#  And after 6.f3 I'd answer with as you might guess 6...Nxf2
484,14,9,O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1N3/2B1n2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',?? But Magnus castled instead.  So I said it's good that you detected the threat. But the problem with this move is that your Ne5 is left en-prise. By playing this I win a piece.  After that I told him that there was only one way to prevent mate and the loss of material.  I attempted to give him Homework with a fen right after 5...Qf6 by asking if he could find it.  Unfortunately he could not.  So I said that best was 6.Ng4 and that way everything holds.  The idea being is that his N is protected and it prevents my Queen from landing f2.  Now that I can't give him direct I'll do the equivalent by giving him things to think about as a mentor does. 
485,14,10,b3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1q3/2B1n2P/1P6/P1PP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',?? After this move I said I understand why you played this Carlson. You fianchettoed with the idea of having a nice long diagnol for your Bc1. That would normally be a good move. But in this position however it is a outright blunder. By playing this your Ra1 is unprotected. Therefore I get a Rook. Better was 7.Nc3 and after 7...Nxc3 8.dxc3 Qxc3 you can protect the Rook with 9.Rb1. 7.c3 was also better as it eliminates the threat completely because it prevents my Queen or Knight from landing on or surpassing that square. Best however was 7.d3 preventing my N from escaping since that would allow 8.Re1 pinning my Queen and thus winning it.  But to give Magnus something else to think about in case let's say his opponent made this kind of blunder I added I would not have blundered but let's say I did and had played 7...Bd6 and you answered with 8.g3 and I answered with 8...Nxg3?? it would work. But this is another blunder because it'll lose more material.
486,14,11,Re1,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2B1n2P/1P6/P1PP1PP1/qNBQR1K1 b kq -',"?? After this move I said  The idea here was to pin the Knight that's what coming through your mind. But it's more important to ask yourself how black is going to respond. Therefore just about any other move was better then this.  And his response was ""True but if you take Be1 you would take my rook but then I could use Qe1 and take your buship. But I don't think there is a way for me to stop you from taking my night with your queen therefor they are defenseless.  Unless I can move my C3 then move Bd3 then I can block your queen from taking my night""  Therefore I told him that In this position moving your c3 would no longer work. What I was alluding is that I can take your Re1. Sure you can take back but I have a Rook for Bishop in addition to what I've won."
487,14,12,Kh2,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1n2P/1P6/P1PP1bPK/qNBQR3 b kq -',"?? But after he played this I said The other option was 9...Kh1 Actually that's what I anticipated. I hate to tell you this but there's  pretty much no good moves left at this point. Had you played 9.Kh1 I'd take. But by moving here I can hold off on that.  The idea behind this statement is that the Rook is now free whereas if I take now he'll get a bishop in return.  The idea being is as kenneth_fiore_3 said ""In chess you have to be cruel.""  I agree with that because linency equals teaching chess in a simpler form when in reality it's a complex game.  If you make things more difficult the student will learn more."
488,14,13,1Kh1,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/2B1n2P/1P6/P1PP1bP1/1NBQR2K b kq -',I did not say anything here because Magnus made the right choice.  Had he play 10.Kh3?? I would mated at once with 10...Qg3#  It might not seem necessary to add this but I will be showing this to my student when the annotation is finished.  By seeing this comment he will learn more of what works and doesn't.  In fact that believe it or not is one of the main reasons that I annotate the training games. 
489,14,14,1Qxe1,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/2B1n2P/1P6/P1PP2P1/1NB1Q2K b kq -',?? But Magnus took back.  So in addition to pointing out why this was wrong I gave my student something else to think about by saying This however was another blunder. Ok why did I wait to take your Rook? The answer is that had I done it right away this move would be ok. But by getting out of check with 10.Kh2?? I was able to place you in check. Once you found the right move I took. But the idea is that by taking back you're going to lose more then just the Rook.  What I'm implying is that had I captured immediately he'd get a bishop in return.  With the delay the Rook was free because I recapturing I'm going to get his Queen and DSB.  Right after this however I wasn't going to say anything else because of what ION noted in the fourth training game with knightrider62.  He said that it doesn't pay to be critical when you have a won position.  Although I sort of disagree with this I also understand why he'd say that.  In my books there was always a chance of getting something back or drawing such as stalemate as I've seen with players like TA.  But once I've won this material in addition to the Queen it's game over.  In other words there's no chance of counterplay.  Interestingly enough I came somewhat close to missing the next move.  However after what happened in my second game against dynamic_dv where he won the Queen with a discovered attack that placed me in check I was able to do the same thing with this student.
490,14,15,Qe1+,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B4P/1P6/P1PP2P1/1NB1q1K1 w kq -',Right before playing this I seeing if there was mate.  So I took game notes but noticed that Magnus could defend.  This was the game note If 13...0-0 with the intention to mate white might be able to defend.  E.g. 14.d3 Re8 15.Bd2 Re2 16.Bd5  But if I check on e8 and take his Bishop it will be over sooner.  In other words I see a quicker win.  That involved this move where I grab his Bc1.
491,14,16,1Nc3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B4P/1PN5/P1PP2PK/2q5 b kq -',Protecting his N for now but as noted earlier the damage has been done.  In fact this is where I'd resign.  But I wasn't going to tell him that because before mentoring him he'd resign after losing a pawn.  The idea was to prevent him from getting him back in the habbit.  Plus if I told my student to resign now I wouldn't know how to do it without making him feel rushed or stressed.  I personally feel that it should be done but I don't know how to say it without going too far.  In fact the only person that said it was safe for me to resign was reversion and when he said that I didn't feel stressed.  But it's knowing how to say that which I'm not good at.  Plus I feel that staying in a lost game like this is better then resigning just because you're down a pawn.
492,14,17,1Ne4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1N2P/1P6/P1Pq2PK/8 b kq -',?? Going after my Queen.  I didn't say anything now for the reason mentioned earlier but just before mating him I said  after 15...Qxd2 you played 16.Ne4 to attack my Queen. I also know what you were thinking as the idea is that you want to gain tempo by attacking a piece. But it's important to see the big picture and what's unfolding. And notify what's really happening on the board or the threat. Therefore you overlooked 16...Qf4+ after which I was going to get your Knight. Best was 16.Nd5 where your Knight would've remained safe. Now 16...c6?? still appears to win the Knight but you can win back a pawn and Rook after 17.Nxc7+ since my King and Rook are forked.
493,14,18,1Kh3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Nq1P/1P5K/P1P3P1/8 b kq -',?? In that same message I said  Then after 16...Qf4+ you had two options but played 17.Kh3?? From then on I wasn't going to take right away as mate was unavoidable. The only move that would've kept you in a little longer was 17.Kh1.   The idea being as mentioned in the private message is that I will be able to coordinate my Queen and LSB to deliver the mate since they are going to go on the same diagonal.  And that will start with the next move.  It's also important to note that just before 18.g4 was played I came a little close to overlooking the mate I have and considered taking the Knight right away.  However I saw the way penelope80 mated duke69 in a training game and I am going to apply the same concept. The idea being as noted is to teach chess in it's most complicated form.  That's when I realized that I could do the same thing even when he plays 19.Kg2 as opposed to 20.Kh2 as opposed to 20.Kg1.

But after my next move white will not hold off much longer.  BTW I played 21...c6 you would have lasted another with 22.Bf1 Magnus.  But after 22...Bxf1 I'd still mate on g2.  However with anything else including on a4 I mate there at once.
495,14,20,Qg2#,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/B3N2P/1P5b/P1P3qK/8 w kq -',"Right before I delivered this mate we had a little conversation.  It was part of what you saw where I mentioned about 16.Ne4?? followed by 17.Kh3??  And what I said is the moral of the story as it is important for him to remember.  In fact this is where I applied a little more of what I learned to teach him as well.  So during the conversation he said ""I'm gonna go to bed so good night I'll play tommorow maybe""  Before the other things mentioned I said there's no need to wait until tomorrow because it's mate.  But after the other two moves I said where you really went wrong was in the beginning with things that are generally a good move.  For example castling is usually a good idea but not in that particular position. That's because your Knight was en-prise so it should've held off as noted. By castling where you did after I took with the Queen you left a Knight en-prise which I got. Then you fianchettoed with the idea of bringing a piece into play with the longest diagnol. This sometimes works but not in the context of our game. The reason why is that you overlooked that the Rook was being attacked. Lastly after winning a Rook you played 8.Re1 to pin my Knight and win it back. It sometimes works but you have to ask yourself if it does so and in that position. You overlooked the Rook and King fork which was at the very least going to win a Rook for Knight. But when you played 9.Kh2?? as opposed to 9.Kh1 it was for free. Shortly after that you blundered the Queen by overlooking the discovered attack. So the main moral to this story is not to make a move because it's usually good. Instead it's important to be weary of all threats made by your opponent. Doing this requires thinking about and analayzing the position carefully and asking yourself how your opponent can respond. That is important and remembering this moral is what is needed to become a better player.  "

I thought that this was the only move to save my position as moving the monarch takes away castling rights.  What I didn't realize is that I was once again focusing on the chess bits and wisdom (chess quotes) which was not my intention at all.  Instead my plan was to try thinking about what the board was telling me (the overall picture).  But this doesn't do that however.  I wanted to get out of check with an attack and castle as I felt that if moving my monarch to d2 or e1 would allow an inevitable Kingside attack similar to what I saw with bhidragon.  However that wouldn't have happened for had I used my Ke1 instead I'd still be safe for a while longer.  That's the actual story here.

The idea is that if I got out of check with my monarch he'd play 5...g2+ with a nasty fork.  And due to the discovered check not only does he get my Rook but reversion would Queen at which I'd be dead.  But I overlooked his next move forgetting that my Rh1 is en-prise.
599,20,7,Qxh1,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/3P2P1/PPP5/RNBQKBNq w Qkq -',After getting my Rook I resigned.  Against anyonelse except for Jack Stockel or reversion I don't resign this early.  In addition to this I'd at the least have to also lose my Queen before resignation would even come into consideration.  And in a regular WTW game that won't even be enough.  Instead the runner must have a proven mating sequence as I generally follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules.  But reversion have and I have an agreement which ION thinks is a good.  That one should resign when you lose material like this as there's nothing else to learn.  Although less then 10 moves it absolutely rings a bell with me.  It actually proves that one should stick to mainlines afterall.  Simply because as my opponent notes had I done this and not blocked my Bishop he wouldn't have been able to check me and it's with the same move we see in the Damiano's Defense.  Second but more importantly seeing that I did it again; this is where if the position becomes more demanding the general chess facts or as you call it chess quotes or wisdom saving the position takes precedence.

Black knight moves again attacking the bishop at a4 whilst the knght at e5 is taken care of by the LB at e6 should he decide to attack.  DB is still waiting to fianchetto and black needs to castle.

Threats are knight at f4 on black's bishop on e6 which is not major.  The queen is at f3 on the a8 diagonal but has a chain of pawns to d5 square.  The bishops are on the a file and DB is aimed at e7 but this is protected by queen at d7.  White king is in the centre still and knight still at b1.

Not sure if this was the best file to move to maybe I did not want to move behind the queen on the d file to avoid being pinned.   Although that was a more open file and would be good for the rook to claim.

On the king side black is preparing an attack at the f2 cell. The white pawns on the kingside appear to be fixed while the black pawns on the queen side are in the same condition. 

The difference from both sides appears to be that white’s major pieces provide both attacking and defending support while black’s strong pieces are mostly committed to the attack on the king side. If I’m committed to this attack black needs to add another piece to the mix. The king side pawns are pretty useless in their current state.

964,30,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So I started with my usual. I should perhaps add that I am annotating the game on the morning after. I am pretty sure of all the moves but I may have got them in the wrong order! Wine was served with the lunch which may explain the poor quality of this game! We were also moving quite fast - just like we used to have a quick game after lunch when we were students together!
965,30,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',He replies in kind.
966,30,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I go into the Queen's Gambit.
967,30,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He replies with the Albin's Counter Gambit! He always played this as a child but it had slipped my mind.
968,30,4,dxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So I take.
969,30,5,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He advances. The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunder—6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+! and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play.
970,30,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I played this.
971,30,7,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is unusual. Black normally plays c5 or Nc6. Michael aims for c5 but he wants to exchange black square bishops first rather than be left with a bishop on f8 restricted by the pawn on c5.
972,30,8,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I figure that exchanges help me as I am a pawn up.

1036,32,0,Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',All standard Icelandic stuff. In the previous game my moves (c6 Bc5 etc.) have failed so I went for the strong line: 
1037,32,1,Qe7,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',You're right: black will have a hard time freeing his dsb and defending from the aligning of the R on e1. I bet I can manage it in a blitz. 
1038,32,2,Be2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Good. 
1039,32,3,Bc4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/2b5/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? This is a little tricky: the Wlsb is pinned so I can do this. But this is pointless as you'll see. Bg4 is no better after o-o. It is a mistake due to the easy d3 answer by white that makes me lose tempos in developement. My opponent didn't play it and it was not a bad choice. 
1040,32,4,O-O,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/2b5/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Of course. Now white threats BxB and Re1. I can retreat my B to e6 but this will be a two tempoes loss. No way. I have just few possible lines here. The point is that white didn't weakened himself with central pawn's moves and this is the best for him in this situation. 
1041,32,5,Nxe2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',If QxB QxQ and everything is quiet.

1044,32,8,Qb4,b'2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/8/1q3N2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Ng5 would be good but QxNf4 is threatened. 
1045,32,9,1Nd3,b'2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/8/1q6/3N1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',? Much better was d3 defending the N while developing. This move makes an unusual white's formation joined with the extreme lack of a pawn's structure... leads to unexplored boundaries. Where to move the Q? I want to free my dsb so out of his diagonal (f8-a3). I want to use white's weakness of f2: true is that it is defended twice now but in the near future Nd3 must move and if one of my N can reach e4 or g4... b6 seems a good place for this. 
1046,32,10,1Qb6,b'2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/1q3n2/8/8/3N1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',It blocks the natural square for the black N on d7. But I am not forced to play it there. On this spot - note - my Q can't be one-move harassed by the White Knights. Now: which point is weak in my field and why and how can white exploit it?
1047,32,11,1b3,b'2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/1q3n2/8/8/1P1N1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Oh not at all. The idea to possess the diagonal and develop the B via b2 is good. But makes this the Nd3 safe and sure? Not at all...
1048,32,12,1Nc5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/2n5/8/1P1N1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Ok the point is that forces white to react: black can play NxN now and rxe3 winning a pawn. If white uses the tempo to play 13. Bg2 black can consider the previous line winning a pawn or RxNe3 (threats Qxf2+so is practically forced) 14. cxe3 Nxe3 threatening to win back the exchange or NxBg2. The only reasonable way for white to get out of this is 15. BxNf6 NxRe1 16. QxNe1 gxBf6. Black has scrambled pawns but a nice semi-open g column to play with and the dsb. Not bad. I'll check this with the board later. On the other side white's NxN allows Bxc5 threatening f2 stopping d4 and solving my dev problem. Not bad!

Now I sill can't take the pawn but I can play Nc3 Q moves Bb4 defending it. But then a3... no I have to create complications... and free my last pieces. I already accepted Nxf7 and the exchange loss so I have to make the most of my playing forces. 
1052,32,16,1Bb4,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/4N3/1b1Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',"It is not good: Bd2 helps white's developement. But if Bd2 Nc3. And the Q is trapped forcing to BxN BxBc3 which forks both white's Rooks. This ""returns"" the fork white will play Nxf7... and the crossed exchanges will go on. Crazy. Of course: If Be2 black can also think in Rxd4!? with the following idea: NxR QxN (Qxf2 is threatened). But white has Be3. So I think that black will lose this if white plays properly. But white didn'!"

1054,32,18,1Bxe1,b'2kr3r/ppp2Npp/1q3n2/8/3Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQb1K1 w - -',This move forces white to retake the B and not one of the Rooks because of Bxf2+. Black can play (and should) have played Be3 stopping once for all all black's threats and his fork is still active. 
1055,32,19,1Nxh8,b'2kr3N/ppp3pp/1q3n2/8/3Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQb1K1 b - -',?? The bad Rook. My other R is the dangerous one!

It threatens Ra1 with a discovered attack on the WQ that makes useless most defences (but Rb1). But white has a brilliant move to answer. Can you see it?
1058,32,22,1Nf7,b'2kr4/ppp2Npp/1q3n2/8/3bn3/1P3N2/P1P3PP/R1BQ1K2 b - -',"Now MY dsb is pinned and it can't give check nor I can force the WK to a square for it to check. Of course I can defend but...

You can get wrong but that's how you explore chess. Now after the R is removed Qf2# is threatened. White's best defence is probably Bd2. White went for...

White's check on Qf5+ just causes Kb8 and nothing changes. Here my opponent blundered QxR and I mated him with Qf2#. What if...

Now I don't like getting into chess terms so much these days because this is where I start missing what the board is telling me.  When Joe plays something different it becomes complicated.  The only reason I'm using this term is because it's the only reason I can figure out for this move being played.  When in doubt it's also good to figure out the reasons.
1122,36,2,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',Adding protection to his f4.  At first I wasn't sure why this was needed since it's not attacked yet.

1123,36,3,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',Joe's idea is to do something different then what you generally.  In this position I'd get my Bf1 out and prepare to castle.  TA played this to mobilize his Rh1.

1126,36,6,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/6N1/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"?? According to Joe this loses.  In it he said ""This game moves into the Allgaier Gambitbut my opponent plays a bad book move early with 5....f6.If you check 5.....f6 is not in the GK opening book.""  I agree because first Jack as noted told me to play moves that are most studied by GM's.  So when TA says opening book it's based on what Grandmasters analyze.  Second it's similar to what you see in the Damiano Defense and what follows is comparable.  As noted this is his week pawn which he leaves vulnerable.  And that's especially applicable here.  In doing so white will be able to exploit his weakness.  Joe also said ""Much better would have been: 

5.Ng5h6 
6.Nxf7Kxf7 
7.Nc3f3 
8.gxf3Be7 
9.Qe2Bxh4+ 

And now abovethe advantage in positioncontrol and tempo is reversed and in blacks hands would have been extremely favorable for the win."""
1127,36,7,Qxg4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/6N1/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',As now Joe has a poisoned pawn.
1128,36,8,fxg5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/8/6p1/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',?? But Tim ignores the danger and takes anyhow.  Now this is similar to what's happened in some of my recent.  Therefore by doing so Joe has a mating sequence.  I think that the only move that would've helped black to last a little longer was 6...Ke7 because of what's coming.  Either way however white is still going to win sooner or later.  But had 5...h6 been played as noted black would still have the initiative.  
1129,36,9,Ke8,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/8/6Q1/4Pp1P/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Although in general you don't want to interpose a piece unless necessary I would've found necessary and would've responded with 8...Nf6  My attitude is that you might as well in a situation like this.
1130,36,10,Kg6,b'rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/6k1/4Q3/2B1Pp1P/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Most of the other moves after that were forced until here.  But I would've felt the need to play 11...d5 as it also appears to block future checks temporarely.
1131,36,11,Qg5,b'rnb2bnr/pppp3p/7k/6qP/2B1PQ2/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',But in this position however I wouldn't have played this.  Instead I'd move my monarch to g7 with the idea now being 14.Qe5+ Nf6 (as a conditional move.)  But despite mentioning what moves I would've played it would not have made a difference as Joe notes.  He'd mate one way or another.  Another way to look at it is after playing 5...f6 followed by the poisoned Knight with 6...fxg5?? Tim had no good moves one way or another.  That is the big picture.
1132,36,12,1d4#,b'rnb2Qnr/pppp2qp/7k/7P/2BPP3/8/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R b KQ d3',"The morals to this story are first try to understand what the board is telling you.  When Tim made the wrong move he missed the big picture because of what followed thereafter.  Most importantly know how to handle the situation.  Or as elyhim as noted puts it ""Stick With what You Know.""  As Joe also implied not knowing how to adjust to something different being the KG led to Tim's downfall."

1182,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The conventional opening.  And Sue will abide as I anticipate.
1183,38,1,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',The problem here is that Duncan decides to bring his Queen out now.  The first thing that should be done is develop the minor pieces with the Queen coming out last.
1184,38,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',So Sue waists no time and brings her pieces out.  This makes me proud because she's remembering what I taught her up to here.  BTW it's important to know that she was able to defeat me.  And I see her becoming good enough to coach and mentor players because I started off in a similar way.  Not sure what to do or how to improve but then had some good teachers with me defeating the main one (Jack Stockel) on a few occasions.  Shortly afterwards I was able to teach chess.

It's not or even similar but I find it comparable and would apply it as if it were with this move as well.  The Berlin Wall starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6  We don't have that because white's Queen as opposed to Knight is on f3.  And Black's Bishop is out. 
1189,38,7,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2NPBQ2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Preparing to exchange bishops.  The idea being that if Sue should take Dun would recapture with his Queen and get a stronger position.  
1190,38,8,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/4P3/2NPBQ2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',But Sues stops it.

The problem is that Sue can exchange bishops.  If that's to happen castling would become unsafe for Duncan.  With that being said This is where I transition out of terms or chess quotes and try to see the big picture.  In the opening it's standard but now's the time to start figuring what the board is saying.  With that being said we start here with what I noted as I'm basing on my recent game behind against bhidragon before I went wrong.  He said that with a bishop remaining on the home square you should not attempt to exchange bishops for the reason provided.
1194,38,12,Nb4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/1n2P3/2NPBQPB/PPP2P1P/R3K1NR w KQ -',Threatening a nasty fork which would win a pawn and rook.  Sue has good intentions.  But I would exchanged with 7...Bxh3 for the reason outlined above.  Nonetheless however Duncan is not going to castle short though.  And it's worth noting that this also would've protected the Rook.  But he protects in a different form.
1195,38,13,Nxa2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/4P3/2NPBQPB/nPP2P1P/2R1K1NR w K -',?? The first blunder.  I know why you played this Sue.  It appears that you've won a pawn.  When I first started playing I made this kind of error as well.  So I know what you're thinking.  The problem is that Duncan can and will win a piece in return.  Therefore it's important to calculate accurately and see what would happen after you take.  Better was still 8...Bxh3.
1196,38,14,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3pbn2/2b1p3/4P3/3PBQPB/NPP2P1P/2R1K1NR w K -',Threatening to win back the Knight.

That right there is dangerous.  In fact while it doesn't appear so that's something that the board shows later on as I saw with some TA's blitz Q sacs.  Better was 10...a6 Sue. 
1199,38,17,Qd7,b'r4rk1/pppq1ppp/3pbn2/4p3/1b2P3/2NPBQPB/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K -',? The is to mobilize her Queen but in doing so white is going to win a pawn Sue.  Better was still 11...a6.  BTW this is one of the problems affiliated with enabling the opponent to maintain an open file.  So this is also where the board tells a story.
1200,38,18,c6,b'r4rk1/Bp1q1ppp/2ppbn2/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1QPB/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K -',Her plan is c6-d5 and if an exchange is to occur black's pawn will be well connected.
1201,38,19,1g4,b'r4rk1/Bp1q1ppp/2ppbn2/4p3/1b2P1P1/2NP1Q1B/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',Stopping the Bishop exchange.

1206,38,24,1Nh5,b'r3r1k1/Bp1q1ppp/2p1b3/3pp1Pn/1b2P3/2NP2QB/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K -',So sue keeps her position safe for now by reattacking.
1207,38,25,1Qf3,b'r3r1k1/Bp1q1ppp/2p1b3/3pp1Pn/1b2P3/2NP1Q1B/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',Likewise Dun needed to defend his position.  So he reattacks.
1208,38,26,1d4,b'r3r1k1/Bp1q1ppp/2p1b3/4p1Pn/1b1pP3/2NP1Q1B/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K -',Sue has similar ideas though.
1209,38,27,1Qxh5,b'r3r1k1/Bp1q1ppp/2p1b3/4p1PQ/1b1pP3/2NP3B/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',So Dun takes.

I don't know why but the problem is that this loses another piece Sue.  Best was 17...dxc3 and white dare not recapture with 18.bxc3 because you'd win a Rook for Bishop after 18...Bxc3+!
1211,38,29,1Bg4,b'r3r1k1/Bp3ppp/2pqb3/4p1PQ/1b1pP1B1/2NP4/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',After white's next move I'm not sure why Dun played this.  I would've taken with 18.Bxe6 as the idea is exchanging pieces while ahead.
1212,38,30,1b5,b'r3r1k1/B4ppp/2pqb3/1p2p1PQ/1b1pP1B1/2NP4/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K b6',I believe that Sue's long term goal is to get a passed pawn.  The idea would be to exchange  Knight for Bishop and advance the b pawn until it get to the second rank where it would become a passer.  Better was like before 18...dxc3 for the reasons outlined earlier.
1213,38,31,1Bf5,b'r3r1k1/B4ppp/2pqb3/1p2pBPQ/1b1pP3/2NP4/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',?? But Dun brings his Bishop.  Instead I would've exchanged with 19.Bxf5  However it is a blunder because black can win back a piece.  Can you figure out how Sue?
1214,38,32,1Bc5,b'r3r1k1/B4ppp/2pqb3/1pb1pBPQ/3pP3/2NP4/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR w K -',? Best was 19...Bxf5 and if 20.exf5 you can answer with 20...dxc3 as now the Queen and Bf5 are forked.  This would at the very least win back a piece for a pawn.  When in doubt just remember our third mentoring session Sue where you won a piece for pawn early.  By playing this however Dun will pick up another pawn.  But now when it does happen black will not get a Rook in return as we'll see later on. 
1215,38,33,2g6,b'r3rk2/B4ppB/2pqb1P1/1pb1p2Q/3pP3/2NP4/1PP2P1P/R3K1NR b K -',Trying to exchange pawns.  After which black's rook would come under fire and when she protects things would I believe get dangerous for Sue.

1217,38,35,2Nf3,b'r3rk2/B3qppB/2p1b1P1/1pb1p2Q/3pP3/2NP1N2/1PP2P1P/R3K2R b K -',Bringing the Knight to a good spot and preparing to do some damage.  However Sue will now take.    
1218,38,36,2bxc3,b'r3rk2/B3qppB/2p1b1P1/1pb1p2Q/4P3/2PP1N2/2P2P1P/R3K2R b K -',As bad as it might seem on top of winning back a piece for pawn Sue will recompensate another piece for pawn.  My first instinct was that white could've refuted that with 23.Bxc3 but then Sue would wind up with the initiative after 23...Rxa1+  
1219,38,37,Qd6,b'r3rk2/b4ppB/2pqb1P1/1p2N2Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2P1P/R3K2R w K -',? Trying to win another piece and even things out.  But this is a mistake as Dun will win back another pawn.  Better was 24...Qf6 as it does the same thing but this time we have another defender to where Dun is going to capture.
1220,38,38,Red8,b'r2r1k2/b4PpB/2pq4/1p5Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2P1P/R3K2R w K -',Protecting her Rook.
1221,38,39,2Rg1,b'r2r1k2/b4PpB/2pq4/1p5Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2P1P/R3K1R1 b - -',Dun however comes up with a nasty plan.  Black must now be careful.  If Sue does not find the right response she'll wind up in trouble.  So how should black proceed Sue.
1222,38,40,2Qc5,b'r2r1k2/b4PpB/2p5/1pq4Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2P1P/R3K1R1 w - -',?? This is a blunder.  Best was 27...g6 and with the Queen in it's original spot white would not be able to take.  However this is even worse then that as white now has a better response.  How should Dun proceed Sue?
1223,38,41,2Rxg7,b'r2r1k2/b4PRB/2p5/1pq4Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2P1P/R3K3 b - -',?? If you did not bring your Queen to c5 Sue this would've been the killer.  The problem here is that you have a chance to pull a swindle.  Therefore best was 28.Qg6!! believe it or not.  That would be followed with 28...Qxc3+ 29.Ke2 Qxa1 and although it looks like you'd get an edge black would be lost shortly after that.  30.Qxg7+ Ke7 31.f8=Q+ Ke6 32.Qfe7#  But how can black get her advantage back?
1224,38,42,2Qxf2+,b'r2r1k2/b4PRB/2p5/1p5Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2q1P/R3K3 w - -',?? This looks good but the solution was 28...Qxh5 getting the Queen.  Not only would you have compensated but black would've found herself ahead with an edge.  By playing this however white now has a win that he can exploit.  Therefore taking the Queen was the only way to save the position believe it or not as we'll find out later on.
1225,38,43,2Kd1,b'r2r1k2/b4PRB/2p5/1p5Q/4P3/2PP4/2P2q1P/R2K4 b - -',I do understand the point behind the checks as you do get a Rook though.  But the problem is the Queen Rook Bishop and passed pawn right near the King.  That's what will prove to be overwhelming.
1226,38,44,3Rg8+,b'r2r1kR1/b4P1B/2p5/1p5Q/4P3/2PP4/2PK3P/q7 b - -',"As now white has the upper hand of hand.  As bhidragon would say ""Happy Birthday! A surprise gift.""  The idea being is that he now has an overwhelming advantage."
1227,38,45,Kd6,b'r2r2R1/b4P1B/2pk4/1p4Q1/4P3/2PP4/2PK3P/q7 w - -',The only other option was 32...Kd7  While not as quick Sue would still lose both her Rooks after 33.Bf5+ Kc7 34.Qe7+  
1228,38,46,3Rxa8,b'R7/b1k2P1B/2p5/1p4Q1/4P3/2PP4/2PK3P/q7 b - -',It appears that Sue is trying to put pressure on the c file.  I used to think along a similar line a lost position like this.  In fact it once happened to Jack Stockel when I had a mating sequence.  How minds think in my opinion become interesting in these kinds of situations.
1229,38,47,3e5,b'R7/b1k2P1B/2p5/1p2P1Q1/8/q1PP4/2PK3P/8 b - -',The idea is to promote.  Dun is presumably remembering that passed pawns must be pushed.  But this is one of the times where I don't care about those terms.  Instead white can win even quicker with 35.f8=Q with the idea being 35...Qxf8 36.Rxf8  I had a similar position with angellis before reaching a 1000 rating.  She was stronger but I promoted right away and got a piece by doing this.
1230,38,48,3Kb6,b'R7/b4P1B/1kp5/1p2P1Q1/8/q1PP4/2PK3P/8 w - -',Trying to last as long as she can.  The idea is to bring the monarch closer to the center.  Once again I abandon the term affiliated with it since despite the delays since black will not last much longer to put it that way.
1231,38,49,3e6,b'R7/b4P1B/1kp1P3/1p4Q1/8/q1PP4/2PK3P/8 b - -',The idea is to promote two pawns.  In general however as with this position you don't need two promotions to win.  Better is actually to promote one or not promote.  I'd say in this case do one but then use what you have to win.  
1232,38,50,3b4,b'R7/b4P1B/1kp1P3/6Q1/1p6/q1PP4/2PK3P/8 w - -',Now I figured it out.  Black is also trying to promote.  But with a pawn closer to a promotion square and an advantage like this Sue that attempt does not work.  I once tried the same thing in a somewhat similar position.  He promoted first and won.
1233,38,51,3e7,b'R7/b3PP1B/1kp5/6Q1/1p6/q1PP4/2PK3P/8 b - -',No matter how long he delayed white is going to promote soon.
1234,38,52,3Qxc3+,b'R7/b3PP1B/1kp5/6Q1/1p6/2qP4/2PK3P/8 w - -',But Sue delays it even more by placing Dun in check.  In this case you might as well deliver checks because it's still about doing what one can to stay in longer.  I also used to be this way when first playing the game.  Come to think of it now before meeting Jack Stockel (and thus) even hearing about this website one of my first trainers was Rose.  And we did similar things.  I was lost yet delivered checks like this.  That delayed her win.
1235,38,53,Qa1+,b'R7/b3PP1B/1kp5/6Q1/1p6/3P4/2P4P/q2K4 w - -',And the idea is still the same that I mentioned earlier.

1237,38,55,4e8=Q,b'R3Q3/b4P1B/1kp5/6Q1/1p6/3P4/1qP1K2P/8 b - -',Dun promotes at once.
1238,38,56,4Qxc2+,b'R3Q3/b4P1B/1kp5/6Q1/1p6/3P4/2q1K2P/8 w - -',Well they have an extra Queen with nothing better you might as well take a pawn.  That's something that Jack told me when mating him.  And it's also something I saw in the most difficult Homework with Susan's win against Karpov.
1239,38,57,4Qd2,b'R3Q3/b4P1B/1kp5/8/1p6/3P4/2qQK2P/8 b - -',I think Dun was worried about a draw by repetition which is why offered to exchange Queens.  I wouldn't have done that.  My next move would've been 41.Kf3 and white would still keep his winning advantage.
1240,38,58,4Qc5,b'R3Q3/b4P1B/1kp5/2q5/1p6/3P4/3QK2P/8 w - -',?? But Sue decides not to liquidate.  The idea being that you don't want to do it while behind.  However refusing to do that in this position enables white to win even quicker.  Better was to accept it and exchange Q's.
1241,38,59,4Be4,b'R3Q3/b4P2/1kp5/2q5/1p2B3/3P4/3QK2P/8 b - -',To protect d3.  But what Dun forgot is that it is protected by his Queen.  I would've played 42.Qd7 here with the idea of 43.Qxa7+ Kb5 (forced) 44.Qa6#
1242,38,60,4b3,b'R3Q3/b4P2/1kp5/2q5/4B3/1p1P4/3QK2P/8 w - -',Sue also wants to promote.
1243,38,61,4d4,b'R3Q3/b4P2/1kp5/2q5/3PB3/1p6/3QK2P/8 b - -',But Dun puts a stop to that.
1244,38,62,4Qb5+,b'R3Q3/b4P2/1kp5/1q6/3PB3/1p6/3QK2P/8 w - -',Like before Sue's doing what she can to stay in longer.
1245,38,63,Qa4,b'R3Q3/b4P2/1kp5/8/q2PB3/1p3K2/3Q3P/8 w - -',I think that Sue was worried about the b pawn.  But Dun is going to promote again.  I think I would've been able to mate already since Qd7 would've been played earlier with the same variations that I noted.
1246,38,64,Kb5,b'R3QQ2/b7/2p5/1k6/q2PB3/1p3K2/3Q3P/8 w - -',Unlike before I won't take time to analyze this move.  That's because one way or another Dun has a mate which he will execute this time around.
1247,38,65,4Qxc6#,b'R4Q2/b7/2Q5/1k6/q2PB3/1p3K2/3Q3P/8 b - -',The moral of this story is what Sue told mentioned right when asking me to annotate the game.  And I absolutely agree with her assessment.  Passed pawns are very dangerous and need to be stopped.  By failing to do that white was able to promote and force a win.  However there was also a chance to stop it by taking the Q on move 28.  Had she played 28...Qxh5! as opposed to 28...Qxf2. those passers would've stopped as well.  So another moral is to look at the entire board and take advantage while the opportunity exists.  If you can remember these moral's Sue you'll improve even quicker.

White opened with Kings pawn to e4."
1249,39,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',I decided to play using the Dutch defence.  I was intending to move my g knight out to f6.
1250,39,2,Qh5+,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White moved his queen down to check my king at h5.
1251,39,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I stopped the check by moving my g pawn to block the queen and protect my f pawn.
1252,39,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p1Q/4P3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',White developed his LB out to d3.
1253,39,5,gxh5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/8/5p1p/4P3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',I took the queen with my g pawn.  Now I found out who was going to lose their queen.  However this has given me doubled pawns on my h file which obviously means I cannot safely cast on the king side.  I don't think I would have chosen to take the queen in this position but if I get a chance to take a queen then I would mostly likely do so.
1254,39,6,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5n2/5P1p/8/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.
1255,39,7,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5n2/5P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',White develops his knight to f3 and prepares to castle.

1257,39,9,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/3p1n2/5P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',White castles.  White looks likely to move his rook onto the e file which only has my undeveloped e7 pawn and the king still on his spot.
1258,39,10,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq c6',I continue to add to my pawn chain with the move c5.  I wonder if e5 would have been a better move as it would stop white from using the e6 square to place his pieces and limit my scope for attack.
1259,39,11,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2P1p/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',White develops his b knight to c3.  White's bishop is looking happy with itself as it is currently at d3 and has access to 2 diagonals to a6 and h7. 
1260,39,12,Bxf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2b1p/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',For some reason I now decide to capture the pawn at f5 and in consequence lose my LB to white.
1261,39,13,Bxf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',White captures my LB.  Actually this may be fair in the circumstances since white gave me his queen its only fair I give him something back.  But there is nothing for the LB to attack so this may be returning to its previous good position but I suppose its here so it might as well stay and cause me difficulties in moving my pieces out.
1262,39,14,Rg8,b'rn1qkbr1/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w q -',I move my rook out to the half open g file as my doubled pawns are both protected by the knight at f6.
1263,39,15,d3,b'rn1qkbr1/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b q -',White moves his d pawn to d3 to allow his DB access to the diagonal to h6.
1264,39,16,Nc6,b'r2qkbr1/pp2p2p/2np1n2/2p2B1p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w q -',I develop my b knight to c6 trying to get my pieces out on the queen side so I can long castle.
1265,39,17,1Be6,b'r2qkbr1/pp2p2p/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b q -',Now that pesky LB moves to the spot which I in future will try to fill with my own pieces before my opponent gets in them.  He is now pointed at my rook on g8.
1266,39,18,1Rg7,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w q -',So I bring my rook out to g7 as there is nothing for me to attack at present and white has some squares on the g file protected.
1267,39,19,1h3,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 b q -',White pushes the h pawn out to h3.  This stops my f knight from landing on g4 plus the e6 bishop is also protecting this square.
1268,39,20,1d5,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2n1Bn2/2pp3p/8/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w q -',I push my d pawn out to d5 this is protected by f6 knight and the queen.  It is threatening to move up to d4 and attack the c3 knight.  The pawn also hems in the LB on e6 on one diagonal.
1269,39,21,1Re1,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2n1Bn2/2pp3p/8/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b q -',The white rook is moved across to e1 to take control of this file and protect the LB.  The king is still on his spot.
1270,39,22,1d4,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2n1Bn2/2p4p/3p4/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w q -',Now I push my d pawn and threaten to capture the d3 knight although I am in the reach of the f3 knight.  I have 2 protectors in the c5 pawn and the c6 knight.
1271,39,23,1Ne2,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2n1Bn2/2p4p/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1R1K1 b q -',The knight retreats back to e2.  This was probably a good time for me to bring out my queen but I think I was worried about the LB at e6.
1272,39,24,1Nb4,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/4Bn2/2p4p/1n1p4/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1R1K1 w q -',I decide to move my c3 knight into an area where it can cause a bit of concern to white.
1273,39,25,1Bb3,b'r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/5n2/2p4p/1n1p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1R1K1 b q -',White's LB also decides to move to b3 to protect pawns that are in the firing line.  I see that was one way of removing the pesky LB.  I should now try to fill that hole.
1274,39,26,1Qd6,b'r3kb2/pp2p1rp/3q1n2/2p4p/1n1p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1R1K1 w q -',I now bring my queen out to allow me to long castle.    My queen is protecting 4 pieces in the position she has come out to and has a diagonal which she can control.
1275,39,27,1Nf4,b'r3kb2/pp2p1rp/3q1n2/2p4p/1n1p1N2/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b q -',I should have taken that knight on f4 but I wanted to castle and get my king out of the way.  You know what will happen next.

1277,39,29,1Ne6,b'2kr1b2/pp2p1rp/3qNn2/2p4p/1n1p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Oh no now I have white's knight on the e6 square which I wanted to make sure my opponent could not use.  The knight is threatening to capture my rook or my LB but I am unable to take with my queen as the rook at e1 is waiting to pick up the queen.  The rook has the king and queen to protect it but the DB has no protection.
1278,39,30,1Nbd5,b'2kr1b2/pp2p1rp/3qNn2/2pn3p/3p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',So back comes my knight to d5 which was not really doing anything at b4 so now it is paired up with the knight at f6 and they can see off any attacks on either of them.
1279,39,31,1Bg5,b'2kr1b2/pp2p1rp/3qNn2/2pn2Bp/3p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',White's DB is developed out to g5 and attacking my knight at f6 which is protected by the pawn at e7 queen at d6 and kngiht at d5.

No doubt he will move his 'a' rook and double up his rooks on the e file.  I now see that without my queen at d6 this move was on the cards.  So I should have taken with my king instead.
1283,39,35,1Qc7,b'2k2br1/ppq1p2p/5n2/2pnR1Bp/3p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R5K1 w - -',I move my queen to c7 now threatening the rook which is protected by the knight.

I thought I had a good defence on this file as I have a pawn at e7 which is protected by d5 knight and the queen and DB.  Maybe I was putting too much weight on my pawn's shoulders.
1285,39,37,2Rg7,b'2k2b2/ppq1p1rp/5n2/2pnR1Bp/3p4/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Now I also bring in my rook to g7 so now 4 defenders of this pawn as I saw it.  But of course this may not have been the object of white's threat.
1286,39,38,2Bxd5,b'2k2b2/ppq1p1rp/5n2/2pBR1Bp/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',And the LB slips in from b3 and takes my d5 knight.  One of my defenders gone.

1290,39,42,2Ree5,b'2k2b2/pp2p1rp/1q6/2pRR1Bp/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/6K1 b - -',Now the rook at e1 comes down to e5 and joins his pal on d5.   Nothing to defend this move with.
1291,39,43,2Rf7,b'2k2b2/pp2pr1p/1q6/2pRR1Bp/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/6K1 w - -',I now decide to move my rook to f7 protecting my bishop and still protecting the pawns on e7 and h7.  The rook was threatening the DB at g5 but this was protected by the f3 knight so I don't feel that moving the rook made a lot of difference here.
