0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"So the best female player starts off with the most common opening.  We all know about the saying ""Best by Test.""  But that especially applies to GM's."
1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And Pavlina responds with the Siclian.  And whereas the King's Pawn Game is most common for most players the Siclian is the most common defense for GM's.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As one would expect.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But this is something that I wouldn't expect.  And in fact I think that it's out of book.  The most common move you'd see is the continuation 2...d6 which is what most of us would have played.  But not this move.
4,0,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"Of course I like this move.  But it's under I guess you can say a faulty technicality.  But it's faulty for me and not anyonelse.  That's because I'd do it to go back to familiar lines like Ruy Lopez since I wouldn't know what to play.  However it's generally not a good idea.  The idea being that ...""when someone plays something that doesn't follow what you know then you must also play something that meets the change in the position"".  The question is what move would that be here? "
5,0,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now this move I understand perfectly well.  In this position Pavlina's goal is to fianchetto her DSB.
6,0,6,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile Judit decides to castle.  I think that she made the right choice and if I was white and playing the game this is also when I would have castled.
7,0,7,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',As mentioned earlier black fianchetto's.
8,0,8,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I do not know why white played.  Personally I would have continued developing.  One can develop by either advancing the d pawn or bringing the N into play.  I would have played 5.Nc3 in this position.
9,0,9,e5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/1Bp1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq e6',However black waists no time in continuing to develop.
10,0,10,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/1Bp1p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',? But white almost has the same thing in mind.  I understand why JP played this as opposed to d3 as 6.d3 would have blocked her bishop.  However this move is a mistake as it gives away a pawn after a variety of exchanges.  One of the positives that can be taken away however is that white will have compensation later on.
11,0,11,e5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/6p1/1B2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So all is said and done white continues to advance her e pawn.  My guess is that she wants a passed pawn.  The thing is that we're not at the phase yet and that this is not going to become that at all.
12,0,12,Ne7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/6p1/1B2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',In the meantime black takes advantage of her opportunities to continue developing.
13,0,13,1Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/6p1/1B2P1B1/3p4/8/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',The only problem is that white goes on the offense by pinning Pavlina's N.  As a result I would have said that better was 10...Nf6?? except that it could result in the same.  In fact that move would be a serious blunder due to white's e5 pawn.  And 10...Nh6?? is not any better as it would also lose a piece due Judit's DSB.  So was the best move here.
14,0,14,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/6p1/1B2P1B1/3p4/8/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',So now black tucks her monarch away.  However the problem is that it allows something that white is about to do.  What is that?  Well it allows JP to win back a pawn because of 11.Qxd4  Having said that castling should have waited for another move this time as best was 10...Bxe5 winning another pawn and putting white further behind. 
15,0,15,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/1B2P1B1/3Q4/8/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',So black decides to kick her white's Q.  Of course there's more to chess then simply attacking pieces.  So what was the goal?  I believe that it was tempii.  That the idea being was for Pavlina to attack her opponents Q to gain time so that she can then develop.  And black kept in mind that if white were to capture so 12.Bxd8 then black can recapture 12...Nxd4
16,0,16,1Qh4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/1B2P1B1/7Q/8/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',? However white launches a different attack this time on the K side.  But at the same hitting on black's Q so black must now take action.  The only problem however is that sooner or later it loses a pawn.  That's the only reason as to why this move is a mistake.  And unlike before it's going to be a lot harder to for her to find compensation.  In fact it will be an unusual since white is not going to win back material.
17,0,17,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1pbp/1qn3p1/1B2P1B1/7Q/8/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',And this is how she does that.  But don't know why.  I guess however black attacks with the idea being tempii because it should force white to retreat her LSB so that black can continue developing.  The only thing is that Judit has one move up her sleeve.
18,0,18,1Nc3,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1pbp/1qn3p1/1B2P1B1/7Q/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And here it is.  Instead of losing tempo white actually gains time so black did not achieve her goal.  In fact it backfired as 12...Qb6?! actually allowed white to complete development.  The only problem as noted before is that black wins material a free pawn.
19,0,19,1Rae1,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1p1p/1qn3p1/1B2b1B1/7Q/2N5/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',"!! Yes it's generally very good to do after completing development.  But at first I wasn't sure why white would play this and most certainly wouldn't even give a !.  Reason: with this move black will be able to exchange more material and when you're behind it's generally not a good idea to exchange as it would give you less to defend with.  But that is not the case here.  In fact there's a strategy behind this after that exchange which is what makes this move extraordinarly brilliant deserving a !!  So Pavlina ""Better be careful from now on"" otherwise white will crush her.  "
20,0,20,Qxb5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1p1p/2n3p1/1q4B1/7Q/2P5/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',"?? Normally a move like this would deserve a !.  But the saying ""To take is a mistake"" applies here.  Black got overly confident since she was ahead and this was Judit's plan all along.  The idea was to force an exchange and give up a piece.  After which something even bigger is going to happen which is going to seal black's fate.  That's why this move was actually the losing blunder.  Note: What looks good might actually be bad and it's important to be aware of that."
21,0,21,1Qh6,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1p1p/2n3pQ/1q4B1/8/2P5/P4PPP/4RRK1 b - -',So white's brilliant plan starts with this move.  Therefore as noted Pavlina just walked into a lot of trouble that she won't be able to get out of.
22,0,22,1Qf5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1p1p/2n3pQ/5qB1/8/2P5/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',I don't know why black played this.  But this time no matter what she does it does not matter this time.  That's significant you know because everything you and your opponent is essential and therefore should matter as few commentators said in some of my past annotations.  But this is as an exception because no matter what white has an inevitable mating pattern that black cannot get out of.
23,0,23,1Qxf8+,b'r1b2Qk1/pp1p1p1p/2n3p1/5qB1/8/2P5/P4PPP/4RRK1 b - -',"And after taking the R black resigned.  Unlike the last time resignation is not premature here.  Why?  Well normally you'd think that this is quite bad as that move should win a Q for a R.  But ""It's not so easy"" as Jack Stockel and Judit Polgar has said.  And there's way to more this then meets the eye.  The reason being is that white now has a mate in two.  17...Kxe8 (forced) 18.Bh6+ Kg8 (forced) Re8#."
24,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',An unusual opening leads to approximate opening equality but Black gets an edge in the middlegame when White fails to fix his defects efficiently and wins late as a direct result of early issues.
25,1,1,dxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"The Englund Gambit Accepted.  White could have ""opted out"" with 2.e4 with a counter gambit offer (The Danish/Goring/Scotch Gambit complex).  Interesting also is 2.d5."
26,1,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black's options include 2...f6 and 2...d6.  The latter can transpose to a gambit line of Black's in the Philidor.  The Englund Gambit coplex is actually three or four different gambits.  The Soller (2...f6) the Englund (2...Nc6) the Hartlaub (2...d6) and the Blackburne which arises out of the Hartlaub.  I have also experimented with 2...Bc5 then 3...Qe7 and perhaps 4...Nc6 but this is sometimes cumbersome against best play by White and definitely difficult to play under such circumstances.  If white hesitates however...
27,1,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',If White wants to test Black then a different third move is probably needed.  A favorite is 3.Qd5.
28,1,4,Nc3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/8/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Maybe 6.c4 is better?
29,1,5,Bd2,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/1b6/2N1P3/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Wisely unpinning the Queen's Knight immediately before Black can build any significant pressure.
30,1,6,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pq3/1b6/2NBP3/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The opening is pretty much over and in taking stock we see Black has a healthy bit of the center and a Queen that might be attacked while White is solid and ready to push e3-e4. If White gets the e4 push in soon the Black Queen may need to take time to move to a safe square.  Dynamic equality? 
31,1,7,Bd6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pq3/8/P1NBP3/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Initially 10.a3 moves Black's Bishop to a very threatening position.  Which is not particularly strong as White easily parries the mating threat. Most likely the Black Bishop is going to eventually need to re-position so maybe 10.g3 to counter the expected ...Bd6 is convincing? A different plan with Re1 and e4 is in order too.  I suspect 10. a3 is to help implement e3-e4.
32,1,8,1f4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pq3/5P2/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - f3',Black loses a tempo now but White has weaknesses to attack.  Question is do you think the position at 9....0-0 or 11...Qe6 is easier for White?
33,1,9,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3bqn2/3p1P2/8/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',An interesting solution!
34,1,10,1Qe5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pqP2/8/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Maybe 11.g3 (or even 10.g3) was better since White now ends up playing it to stop another mating threat? Seems like it is always easier to see stuff after the fact.
35,1,11,Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3pqP2/4n3/P1NBP1P1/1PPB3P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Dreaming of ...Nxg3 sacks....
36,1,12,1Bxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3pqP2/4B3/P1N1P1P1/1PPB3P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Apparently White was also dreaming of knight to g3 sacrifices!  White makes certain all I can do is dream about those sacks. I expected 14. Bxe4 however.  White's pawn structure will soon be inferior to Black's. Depending on your viewpoint you might say the same situation existed at move 8.
37,1,13,1Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/3b2p1/4qP2/4N1Q1/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/R4RK1 b - -',White wins a pawn...
38,1,14,1Bxf5,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/3b2p1/4qb2/4N1Q1/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/R4RK1 w - -',For a second...
39,1,15,1Rxf5,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/3b2p1/4qR2/4N1Q1/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/R5K1 b - -',Exchange sacrifice!
40,1,16,1Qh4,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/3b2p1/5q2/4N2Q/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/R5K1 b - -',Now 18.Qxf5 gxf5 19.Nxd6 cxd6 gives Black a bad pawn structure too.  I do not think it would matter however since the two Rooks will probably be better than the Rook and Bishop in this position.
41,1,17,1Be5,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/6p1/4bq2/4N2Q/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/R5K1 w - -',Stopping the Nf6+ right away.  Maybe the b2 pawn can soon become lunch...
42,1,18,1Rf1,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/6p1/4bq2/4N2Q/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/5RK1 b - -',Now 19.Ng5 does not seem convincing to me. The game move seems best for White.
43,1,19,f5,b'r4rk1/pppq3p/6p1/5p2/4N2Q/P1P1P1P1/2P4P/5RK1 w - f6',Again trying to keep the Knight off f6.
44,1,20,2Nf6+,b'r4rk1/pppq3p/5Np1/5p2/7Q/P1P1P1P1/2P4P/5RK1 b - -',Obviously I did not do so but at least now the Nf6+ is not as unfavorable for Black.
45,1,21,2Rxf6,b'r5k1/pppq3p/5rp1/5p2/7Q/P1P1P1P1/2P4P/5RK1 w - -',One exchange sacrifice deserves another!
46,1,22,2Qd4,b'r5k1/ppp2q1p/6p1/5p2/3Q4/P1P1P1P1/2P4P/5RK1 b - -',Dynamic equality again?  Not quite this time.  Black still has the better pawns but a better pawn structure does not confer much as far as winning a game at this point. The weakened pawns do however give Black a target and an ability to formulate clear plans against those targets.  I think I would have traded Queens if I was White.  There would be less in the way of pieces to work against the weaker pawn structure.  The White King and Rook should then be able to hold the draw.
47,1,23,2exd5,b'r5k1/p6p/1p4p1/2pP1p2/8/P1P3P1/2P4P/5RK1 b - -',I will argue the earlier Queen (the road not taken) trade would have left an easier to defend pawn structure for White.
48,1,24,2c4,b'3r2k1/p6p/1p4p1/2pP1p2/2P5/P5P1/2P4P/5RK1 b - -',The option was 28.Rd1.  Maybe this was better? My hunch is to say affirmative. Hard to say.  For example 28.Rd1 Re8 29.Kf2 b5 still leaves White with some problems to solve.
49,1,25,Re4,b'6k1/p6p/1p4p1/2pP1p2/2P1r3/P5P1/2P2K1P/5R2 w - -',It was going to be hard to defend the c4 pawn after Black gained control of the e-file.  Obviously contesting that control is important to White's survival.  At this point it is too late and White needs to conjure up a dynamic reply.
50,1,26,3Rd1,b'6k1/p6p/1p4p1/2pP1p2/2r5/P5P1/2P2K1P/3R4 b - -',Maybe 30.Rd1 was better? White is unable to defend the c2 pawn now. The pawn structure is going from bad to gone.  After 30.Rd1 White could defend c2 although his position would be fast becoming very non-dynamic.  Lacking dynamic counterplay when down material is not a good thing! 
51,1,27,Kf8,b'5k2/p6p/1p4p1/2pP1p2/8/P3K1P1/2r4P/3R4 w - -',The idea is to stop White's only winning chance right away...the supported d5 passer.
52,1,28,Rc4,b'4k3/p6p/1p1P2p1/2p2p2/2r4P/P3K1P1/8/3R4 w - -',White should try to avoid the Rook trade!
53,1,29,Kxd6,b'8/p6p/1p1k2p1/5p2/3K3P/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Game over.... a passed pawn on both sides means White can not stop Black from advancing to Queendom on at least one side of the board!
54,1,30,a6,b'8/7p/pp1k2p1/5p2/2K4P/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Again the defects in my opponent's position allow me to formulate clear and effective plans to further irritate the sore spots.
55,1,31,Kd3,b'8/8/6p1/5p1p/7P/3k2P1/1p6/1K6 w - -',The loyal Queenside pawns complete their mission by sacrificing for the greater good.
56,1,32,g5,b'8/8/8/5ppp/7k/5K2/8/8 w - -',Resigning would be the best move but perhaps a stalemate is possible.... You can not get a draw by giving up!
57,1,33,6Kh1,b'8/8/8/8/8/5ppp/4k3/7K b - -',The stalemate is not likely. 
58,1,34,g2+,b'8/8/8/8/8/7p/5pp1/4k2K w - -',The only constant was White's inferior pawn structure and Black's ability to keep the problem at the forefront.  If White's game is to be improved most likely the first goal would be to avoid the bad structure or at least efficiently correct the issues as soon as possible.
59,2,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Normal opening

I have some really mixed emotions here!  On the one hand I am chuffed to gain parity with my on the board nemesis in chief Freddy the Master Mater on the other I somehow feel I could have got even more out of the game if I had had Henry on b1 instead of a1 to allow my knight to interpose a back row check so that my heavies and my g pawn passer could really get to work.  Alas this did not happen and my advantage dissipated and at one time Freddy had a big advantage in the endgame.  Thankfully he slipped up and allowed me back into the game and not only that he found himself playing reluctant host to Glenda and her white steed late on in the game.  Freddy eventually allowed a draw by repetition.  So how did all this come about?  Well read on......."

Now I must turn my attention back to the queenside.  I move Henry to a1 where he stays until move 41.  However this move will waste a vital tempo later on which could have made a difference between an Expert Draw and an Expert Victory.  You will see just how!

Would Kb1 rather than an immediate Rxf7+ on the next turn have made the difference between me being merely jstevens1 or TheBlackQueen?!
116,4,22,Qxh4,b'8/1k1r4/1p4Q1/r1p3P1/p2pP2q/P2P4/NPP5/K2R4 w - -',"34. ..... Qxh4 - after all that plethora of exchanges I have 2 pawns for the exchange.  Unfortunately my passer on g5 is also isolated and it is really weak.  If Henry had been on b1 then Nc1 would allow interposition without loss of the knight to a back row check.  This would allow my rook to join in and defend that weak g pawn and maybe shepherd it to Glendadom.  But Henry is on a1 and not b1 and that is a real headache.  As a result of this over the next fifteen moves or so apart from a few spurts I ended up letting my clock wind down to just over 2 days per move before making a decision.

199,9,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',At this point I'm already trying to calculate what next. My mind is already saying to develop knight's to c3 and b3 as well as Bishops to c4 and e3 but also Rooks on d1 and e1. I also want my queen on f3. My pawn structure should be orientated on attacking the centre achievable by playing f4 h3 and Kb1 to get my King safe.
200,9,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays the Prins defence perhaps the most solid in this situation.

204,9,6,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',An important move that although blocks in the c8-bishop contests the centre heavily.
205,9,7,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',This is to counter Black's two central pawns. My future plans are to pick out pawn targets to castle (most likely queenside) and to play Bc4 h3 and develop my heavy pieces.
206,9,8,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A passive yet necessary move.

208,9,10,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',The first move to not be by the book. Computer analysis says this is an innacuray and that Black would have more success with 8...h6 or 8...Qc7. To accord to my plan I am aiming to attack the king or at least limit the movement of Black. However it is also important to note the weakness on b6 and that this is a potential target.
209,9,11,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',My response is intended to aim at Black's kingside. The h7-pawn is a real weakness.
210,9,12,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Strong : Forces my d4-knight to stay in the centre or control it from afar.

212,9,14,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/4PP2/1NNB1Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',?! In my opinion a dubious move. I can now put a pre-meditated plan into action - To make Black's pieces (namely the Bishops) useless and poorly situated.
213,9,15,1f5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/4pP2/4P3/1NNB1Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',You will now notice several positional plusses for me. Firstly Black's c8-bishop has one square to move to. Secondly the f6-bishop is now the only defender to Black king. Furthermore the d6-pawn is now a backwards pawn and liable to attack. Also the d5-square is now weak enough for me to attack the f6-bishop thereby removing the defender. Also a pawn march is now a potential threat. I also have my eyes on 1. h4 Bxh4? 2. Qh3... +/-. 
214,9,16,1Nb4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p2p1b2/4pP2/1n2P3/1NNB1Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',A strong move. My bishop can't move else 13...Nxc2+. Also d5 is now partly covered.

219,9,21,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b3ppp/p2p1b2/1p2pP2/4P3/PNNQ4/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',?! Black prefers development over material.

Kb1!... leads to poor counterplay for Black but this looked interesting and I didn't want to pass up the opportunity. There is no material threat - 16...Bxh4 17. Qh3? Bg5+ and Black is relatively safe. However after I gambit the pawn away I end up with strong pieces and a poorly placed bishop for Black.

226,9,28,Rdc8,b'2r2rk1/1b3ppp/p7/1p2QPq1/4P2b/PNN5/1PP3P1/1K1R3R w - -',?? This move effectively costs the game. Black had two main options. One was the defensive 19... h6 which secured an average endgame albeit a pawn down. However the more aggresive and striking option was 19... Bg3! which would lead to complications for me in the centre and give Black a chance to win his pawn back with 20. Qc5 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Qf4 and strong play from Black would secure a strong endgame.
227,9,29,2Qh2,b'2r2rk1/1b3ppp/p7/1p3Pq1/4P2b/PNN5/1PP3PQ/1K1R3R b - -',At this point some form of disaster is inevitable.

229,9,31,Bxe4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p7/1p3Pq1/4b2b/PNP5/2P3PQ/1K1R3R w - -',Black can get some compensation in the form of central pawns for his bishop.

231,9,33,2Qc5,b'5rk1/5ppp/p7/1pq5/3Nb2Q/P1P5/2P3P1/1K1R3R w - -',?? If 23... Qg6 an alternative variation was 24. Rde1 Bf5 25. Nxf5 Qxf5 26. Re5! [ 26...Qxe5 27. Qxh7#] 26...Qg6 27. Rg5!...
232,9,34,2Qxe4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p7/1pq5/3NQ3/P1P5/2P3P1/1K1R3R b - -',1-0 Thankyou to my opponent for this game!
233,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I got in the habit of playing this ONLY because it was said to be Bobby Fischer's favorite 1st move.
234,10,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And the Sicilian...
235,10,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah yeah I know I could move Nc3...
236,10,3,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',At this point black has what he wants; a superior center with excellent counter-attacking chances. So black ought to just pursue playing that way or so I would think.
237,10,4,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Because I don't know all the continuations now as many of you know them I make this quiet move causing black to think as this surely isn't the best white response.
238,10,5,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq e6',Black makes a decent reply and threatens to crash down in the center. I for one am glad his bishop isn't going down that diagonal. Not yet anyways!
239,10,6,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',I play c4 indicating that I hope to play in the fashion of the Maroczy bind trying to tie up the center but black is positioned so that this should not occur. I've found that in these kinds of positions black often underestimates the strength of kingside attacks which will be my goal here. This much I do know: black can thwart this in one of two ways; a break involving ...f5 or ...d5. Which will he choose?
240,10,7,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He chooses to develop preparing to first castle before committing.
241,10,8,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',This position is slightly favorable to black but at least white has the initiative for the moment.
242,10,9,Kh1,b'r1bq1rk1/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1R1K b - -',Prophylactic move; black will not have time for Ng4; the best thing for black now may be that central push which will immediately cause white problems since ...d5 is very good here.
243,10,10,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2pp1n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1R1K w - -',However black chooses ...d6 when d5 was much better. Still playable along with Rb8 or even Re8 however. But not as strong as ...d5.
244,10,11,1Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2pp1n2/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K b - -',I choose the best response; Bg5.
245,10,12,1h6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K w - -',Will he or won't he? Yes he will. Black asks the question. Rb8 was slightly better here however.
246,10,13,1Bh4,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K b - -',Far and away the best move for white now.
247,10,14,1Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K w - -',Here white chooses Rb8 after moving the white bishop off of the c1-h6 diagonal. ...Bd4 was also playable.
248,10,15,1Qe2,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP2QPPP/RN3R1K b - -',And here I make an inaccuracy. Better was Qc2. This eventually costs me a tempo and could (should?) have cost the game. Perhaps Nc3 was the best move in this position but perhaps not.
249,10,16,1Bd4,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2PbP2B/3B4/PP2QPPP/RN3R1K w - -',What else? ...g5 was a good choice too depending on black's long-term strategies.
250,10,17,1Nc3,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R4R1K b - -',Only one move now for white Nc3. All other moves and black will be much better than white. As things are now black is definitely better.
251,10,18,1a5,b'1rbq1rk1/5pp1/2pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R4R1K w - a6',Inexplicably however black now chooses a5 which is not a bad move but where is the fit with the position here? ...g5 or ...Bg4 or even ...Be6 were both good choices. Bd7 is playable but a bit passive. a5 will be useful but... I think it's a bit early here allowing white some time. Which I need. Lucky me...
252,10,19,1Rab1,b'1rbq1rk1/5pp1/2pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/1R3R1K b - -',Other than moving one of the rooks f3 was possible. Fritz considered Na4 too but I did not; it's generally not good to position knights out of the action of course because with careful play an opponent can capitalize on the tempos it would take to bring that knight back into the board. And I did not feel like calculating a zillion or so moves to see if Na4 would be okay or not.
253,10,20,1Ba6,b'1r1q1rk1/5pp1/b1pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/1R3R1K w - -',This was one of the crucial positions of the game. As tempting as it might be for some to think taking on c3 would be good for black a closer look reveals it may not be. My opponent saw this but unfortunately did not see the best move here. Ba6 seemed kind of awkward to me and to Fritz. Fritz much preferred Be6 or g5; Qe7 is also playable.
254,10,21,1Qd2,b'1r1q1rk1/5pp1/b1pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP1Q1PPP/1R3R1K b - -',And I made a blunder here but my opponent did not see the combination that would have won him a pawn. Can you spot it? Stop and look for it. Not too hard to spot but this was blitz after all. Anyways Qc2 was the correct move for white. Also playable was Nd1. Rfc1 was one of Fritz's other choices but my desire was to play f4 at some point soon so I did not even look at that. This was also why I missed the possible loss of the pawn. To win a pawn black responds simply 15...Bxc3 Qxc3 Nxe4 Bxe4 Qxh4 Rfe1 (due to the bishop xray) Qxf2 Bxc6 and things are looking difficult for white.
255,10,22,1Qe7,b'1r3rk1/4qpp1/b1pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP1Q1PPP/1R3R1K w - -',Lucky for me black did not wish to part with his bishop pair and did not even consider looking further. Nxe4 was also possible.
256,10,23,1b3,b'1r3rk1/4qpp1/b1pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/1PNB4/P2Q1PPP/1R3R1K b - -',So I choose the best response here and the opportunity for black to win a pawn evaporates.
257,10,24,1Qe6,b'1r3rk1/5pp1/b1ppqn1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/1PNB4/P2Q1PPP/1R3R1K w - -',All of this positioning to fight over d5 causes black to lose what could have been had. White's move now is rather obvious and I waste no time in moving my knight. Other moves are not nearly as good.
258,10,25,Bb6,b'1r3rk1/5pp1/bbppqn1p/p3p3/2P1P2B/1P1B4/P2QNPPP/1R3R1K w - -',Provided I make no more blunders I finally have a small advantage now.

I can force the black queen to move but eschew that for the moment; I am going to obfuscate. That is I will create a plan on the queenside that black will counter then pursue my real plan on the kingside and hope black cannot react quickly enough. Yeah that's right. I thought this stuff up all right but I could not see far enough ahead in the time I had to think to know if things would work out or not. As it turns out it does but not by much.

Black has sealed off his queen from pressuring the queenside and failed to protect the h6 pawn thinking instead to rid himself of the white bishop but doing so is much much too slow for this position.

So some simple misdirection all along planning to sacrifice on h6 if I could. I had a lot of help of course by my opponent in this blitz game. Unless I'm mistaken most proper Sicilian black moves try to get white castled on the queenside since black hopes to attack down that side. With my King untroubled over on the kingside black's remaining pieces are very much unprepared to help defend his own king directly or indirectly.

350,13,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This capture is not consecuent with 2 ... c5 controlling d4-square. Now White has a KGA where c5 is a weakness!

Black has alternatives; black can play Na6 and Bd7 for example or open the center with Ne8 and f5. I choice attack the kingside (h6 specifically) with Qd2 but Qe1 and Qg3 is another idea.

361,13,14,b5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppn/3p4/1ppNb3/2B1P3/3PB3/PPPQ2PP/1R3RK1 w - b6',This move was unexpected for me.

365,13,18,1Qd1,b'2bq1rk1/p4ppn/3p4/2pN4/2B1P3/b1PPB3/P5PP/3Q1RK1 b - -',But now for keep the bishop (white threat Qa4) black need misplaced the queen. Now white has attack in the kingside 
366,13,19,2Qh5,b'2b2r1k/p3Nppn/3p4/q1p4Q/2B1P3/b1PPB3/P5PP/5RK1 b - -',Now I do not see defense for black.
367,13,20,fxg6,b'2b2r1k/p5pn/3p2p1/2p4Q/2B1P3/b1qPB3/P5PP/5RK1 w - -',Bad move really but 22 ... Kg8 23 Nxg8. Now black can not recapture if 23... Nxg8 24 Bxf7++ else 23... Kxg8 24 Qxf7++. 
368,13,21,2Rxf8#,b'2b2R1k/p5pn/3p2p1/2p4Q/2B1P3/b1qPB3/P5PP/6K1 b - -',
369,14,0,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not a common response. Usually black vies for the center with 2.d5 or plays 2.Nf6. Here black wants to compete with my fianchetto setup with one of his own. 
370,14,1,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pbpppppp/1pn5/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I was a bit surprised at this move. I mean what about your kingside? But maybe black wanted to castle queenside. But still I think it would have been better to leave the diagonal open and put the knight on d7 later. 
371,14,2,f6,b'r2qkbnr/pbppp1pp/1pn2p2/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Another odd move to me. Maybe black was thinking of preparing an early pawn storm against my king but in that case maybe f5 was better. 
372,14,3,h5,b'r2qkbnr/pbpp2p1/1pn2p2/4p2p/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq h6',Black made a lot of pawn moves and did not develop pieces. Well anyways. it definitely looked like a pawn storm.

376,14,7,d4,b'r2qk1nr/pbpp4/1pn2p1b/4p1pp/2NPP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Since black's king had not castled I was trying to break open the center to get a few punches in his direction. And if that didn't work I would apply pressure on e5 and the center in general.

379,14,10,1Nb8,b'rn2k1nr/pbp1q3/1p1p1p1b/3Pp1pp/2N1P3/P3B1P1/1PPN1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Wants to relocate the knight with good reason but completely misses my discovery attack. 
380,14,11,Kd8,b'rn1k2nr/pbp1q3/1p1p1p1b/3Pp1pQ/2N1P3/P3B1P1/1PPN1PBP/R4RK1 w - -',Black has no castling capacity his pieces are dismal and he does not have much in the way of counterplay. I got really confident at this point and believed the game to be set in stone as a win for me. Lesson: don't play ego games with yourself - just play your best until its over. 
381,14,12,a5,b'rn1k2nr/1bp1q3/1p1p1p1b/p2Pp1p1/2N1P3/P3B1P1/1PPNQPBP/R4RK1 w - a6',A really good move. Its his best way to counteract my position. Before he could try to scare away the knight with b5 but I have a sweet spot on a5. But now with this move my sweet spot is gone. At this point I should have secured a place for the knight. But.... instead I thought he was merely gaining space and doing nothing. In other words I got lazy and didn't thoroughly analyze as I should have. 
382,14,13,1Rae1,b'rn1k2nr/1bp1q3/1p1p1p1b/p2Pp1p1/2N1P3/P3B1P1/1PPNQPBP/4RRK1 b - -',Preparing for an attack starting with f4 - it covers the e4 pawn after multple exchanges. But as I mentioned I completely forgot about my knight hanging.... overconfidence kills my friends. 
383,14,14,1Nxd6,b'rn1k2nr/1bp1q3/3N1p1b/pp1Pp1p1/4P3/P3B1P1/1PPNQPBP/4RRK1 b - -',I decide to take down something before I see the grave.

385,14,16,2Qxd7+,b'rn2k1nr/1b1Q4/1B1p1p1b/p2Pp1p1/4P3/P5P1/1PPN1PBP/4RRK1 b - -',I exchange in light that I have three pawns for a piece which can come in handy in the endgame so I try to exchange pieces quickly. 
386,14,17,g4,b'2r1k1nr/3n4/b2p1p1b/3Pp3/p1P1P1p1/P3B1PB/1P1N1P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',An interesting decision. Black gives up a pawn to worsen my pawn structure and make my circumstance a bit worse. I don't know if it is the most sound move but it was reasonably effective against me. I am a bit of a pawn muncher and love to secure slight advantages with extra pawns so I was happy. 
387,14,18,Ng8,b'6nr/4k2r/b2p1p2/2nPp3/p1P1P3/P3P1PP/1PBN1RK1/5R2 w - -',My attack does not have much merit - it is easily defended though it looks slightly pretty.

391,14,22,Rc5,b'8/3bkr2/3p1p2/2rPp3/p1P1P1nP/P3P1P1/1P2R1K1/2RB4 w - -',At this point I definitely have a losing position. Black's knight on g4 is glorious his c-file attack is annoying and I really don't have much to counteract it all. 
392,14,23,f5,b'8/3bkr2/3p3n/2rPpp2/p1P1P2P/P1R1P1P1/1P3RK1/3B4 w - -',I wanted to get rid of my doubled pawn but exchanging on f5 would mean more activity for Black. 
393,14,24,Bf5,b'1r6/4k3/3p3n/3Ppb2/p1P1B2P/P3P1P1/1PR1K3/8 w - -',A prudent move by black. This secures a great position for him and seeks to gain material. 
394,14,25,5Kd3,b'1r6/4k3/3p3n/3Ppb2/p1P1B2P/P2KP1P1/1PR5/8 b - -',Another fault of mine. Clearly Kf3 would have been better despite the pin on the rook because I forgot about this move....
395,14,26,5Rb3+,b'8/4k3/3p3n/3Ppb2/p1P1B2P/Pr1KP1P1/1PR5/8 w - -',When black played this I got a little depressed. I was up a pawn in a bad position which had some chances for me. Now it looked like I would be even in material with simply a poor position. Somehow it completely slipped my mind that black could play this. 
396,14,27,5c5,b'8/4k3/3p3n/2PPpb2/p3B2P/P1RKP1P1/1r6/8 b - -',The only way I could create counterplay. 
397,14,28,5Rb3,b'8/4k3/3p3n/2PPpb2/p3B2P/PrRKP1P1/8/8 w - -',But I got lucky. Black played an inaccurate move. Much better was pawn takes pawn black having tactics if I took on Rc5 i.e. 53. Rxc5 Rb3+ 54. Rc3 RxR winning the bishop. If Black would have taken the pawn I would not take it back immediately. 
398,14,29,5h5,b'8/4k3/2Pp4/3np2P/8/P5P1/1K6/8 b - -',Now the game is simplified which is to my taste. I have threats to promote a pawn on both sides of the board. Theoretically it is either win or a draw for me at this point so I got my confidence back. 
399,14,30,6g4+,b'8/2n5/2P5/P2ppk1P/6P1/2K5/8/8 b - -',It would be nice to take the pawn but that would mean I would promote as the King would lose the race and the knight can't compete in it. 
400,14,31,6Kd3,b'8/2n5/2P5/P2pp1kP/6P1/3K4/8/8 b - -',I tried for a while to see Black would make an inaccuracy but he did not. I offered a draw at this point as I saw through analysis that we would be shuffling pieces for another 20 moves completing nothing. A strange draw for sure - blunders inaccuracies and theoretically unsound ideas made for an odd game that somehow ended in a friendly way.

Once quite the feared weapon from White indeed at one point it was  considered a positional blunder from Black to allow it! However since then  play has been found for Black and in 1995 John Nunn and Joe Gallager write  ""Although the Maroczy Bind is slightly passive for Black players such as  Larsen Petursson and Velimirovic have shown that by patiently waiting for a  lapse of concentration from White this line can offer winning chances for  Black. The theoretical opinion is that White should maintain a slight  advantage but no one should believe that this is a line in which White  cannot lose."" and in the 15th MCO Nick de Firmian says that ""With 5.c4  White...leads to a quiter positional type of game yet Black will get  strangled if he/she cannot find active play"".

504,18,49,4Rxa7,b'8/R3b2n/1p3k2/8/3P4/6P1/P4PK1/8 b - -',White's prospects of winning have improved even more. However it is here where I started to waver.
505,18,50,4f4,b'8/R3b3/1p3k2/6n1/3P1P2/6P1/P5K1/8 b - f3',This move is a good idea but at the wrong time. 43. Rb7 is a better alternative. 43. Rb7 Bd8 then 44. f4 is better for White than the text. If 44... Ne6 45. Rd7 threatening d5 is strong.
506,18,51,4Kf3,b'8/R3b3/1p3k2/8/3PnP2/5KP1/P7/8 b - -',White still had the opportunity to play 44. Rb7. 44... Bd8 45. g4! prevent Black from playing Kf5 activating his own King.
507,18,52,4Nd6,b'8/R3b3/1p1n1k2/8/3P1P2/5KP1/P7/8 w - -',Now Rb7 is no longer possible. Also Black is controlling the e4 square which is the ideal square for my King.
508,18,53,4g4,b'8/R3b3/1p1n1k2/8/3P1PP1/5K2/P7/8 b - -',Still preventing Kf5
509,18,54,4Ra4,b'8/4b3/1p3k2/1n6/R2P1PP1/5K2/P7/8 b - -',Another misstep. I could have played 46.g5+ if 46...Kf7 then I would be able to play g6+ followed by g7 and I would win the bishop on e7 for free. If 46... Ke6 then 47. d5+ Kd6 48. Rb7 Nc7 49. g6 Bf8 50. Rxb6+ Kxd5 51. f5 and white wins easily.
510,18,55,4Ra6,b'8/4b3/Rp2k3/1n6/3P1PP1/5K2/P7/8 b - -',? A panic move. This loses an important pawn on d4. 47. Ke3 and White is fine.
511,18,56,Bc5,b'8/8/Rp2k3/2b5/3nKPP1/8/P7/8 w - -',Now things seem murky. White still should win due to the passed pawns but it is much more difficult now.
512,18,57,5f5+,b'8/8/Rpn1k3/2b2P2/P3K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',Another bad move on my part. 50. g5 would be the right move. This way I can play f5+ without being blockaded on the 5th rank by the king
513,18,58,5Ra8,b'R7/8/1pn2k2/2b2P2/P3K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',Looking to play  Kd5 without the threat of Nb4+ forking king and rook.
514,18,59,5a5,b'R7/4n3/1p3k2/P1b2P2/4K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',I had planned this move but now it doesn't look as good as I previously thought it was. White now allows Black to get rid of possible attack on the weak pawn on b6.
515,18,60,5Rxa5,b'8/4n3/5k2/R1b2P2/4K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',I still think this endgame is winning for White but it requires precise play due to the blockade on the passed pawns. My opponent thought otherwise and offered me a few draws in the subsequent moves which I declined.
516,18,61,5Rb6+,b'8/4n3/1R3k2/5P2/4K1P1/8/3b4/8 b - -',Important move that drives the king from the blockade on the pawns on the kingside. 
517,18,62,5Ke5,b'8/4nk2/1R6/4KP2/6P1/8/3b4/8 b - -',Looking to advance my king
518,18,63,5Bc3+,b'8/4nk2/1R6/4KP2/6P1/2b5/8/8 w - -',Black denies this possibility
519,18,64,Bd2,b'8/4nk2/1R6/5P2/4K1P1/8/3b4/8 w - -',Time to try another idea...
520,18,65,Bc1,b'8/4nk2/3R4/5P2/4K1P1/8/8/2b5 w - -',Black's Bishop must stay on the blockade at g5 or else White is having a much easier time than the current position.
521,18,66,6Ke5,b'8/4nk2/8/4KPb1/6P1/8/8/3R4 b - -',Trying the king advance again.
522,18,67,6Kd6,b'8/5k2/2nK4/5Pb1/6P1/8/8/3R4 b - -',I was skeptical of bringing my king away from the pawns but I could not find any immediate consequences of the King's journey. However I think it might've been best to try another route. 
523,18,68,6Ne7,b'8/4nk2/3K4/5Pb1/6P1/8/8/3R4 w - -',Black's knight returns to its previous post. It too cannot stray away from the White Pawns
524,18,69,6Re1,b'8/4nk2/3K4/5Pb1/6P1/8/8/4R3 b - -',Possible looking to play Re6
525,18,70,6Kd7,b'8/3Knk2/8/5P2/5bP1/8/8/4R3 b - -',?? A huge mistake that allows an easy draw
526,18,71,6Bg5,b'8/3Knk2/8/5Pb1/6P1/8/8/4R3 w - -',? 63... Nxf5! leads to an easy draw after 64. gxf5 Kf6
527,18,72,6Re6,b'8/3Knk2/4R3/5Pb1/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',However White achieves an ideal post for the rook and now prevents ...Nxf5 simplifying to a draw.
528,18,73,6Kd6,b'8/4nk2/3KRb2/5P2/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',Now White is on top again
529,18,74,6Ke5,b'8/4nk2/4R3/4KPb1/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',White's King now achieves the ideal post on e5 and now he cannot be checked by the Dark-Squared Bishop.
530,18,75,6Bh4,b'8/4nk2/4R3/4KP2/6Pb/8/8/8 w - -',Black is just shuffling with his Bishop. Ng8 seems like an interesting try to hold the position.
531,18,76,6Rh6,b'8/4nk2/7R/4KP2/6Pb/8/8/8 b - -',White continues to harrass the Bishop.
532,18,77,6Rh5,b'8/4nk2/8/4KPbR/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',68. Rh7+ driving the King to the 8th rank seems preferable 
533,18,78,6g5,b'8/4nk2/8/4KPPR/8/8/8/2b5 b - -',White achieves the much needed pawn advance and now I had no doubt that I had a won position now.
534,18,79,6Ng6+,b'8/5k2/6n1/4KPPR/8/8/8/2b5 w - -',Black tries to lure White into a swindle.
535,18,80,7Ke4,b'8/5k2/6n1/5PPR/4K3/8/8/2b5 b - -',Of course not 70. fxg6+?? Kxg6! where White loses the g-pawn and the win with it.
536,18,81,7f6+,b'8/6k1/5Pn1/6PR/4K3/8/8/2b5 b - -',Clearing the f5 square for my King.
537,18,82,7Kf5,b'8/5k2/5Pn1/5KPR/8/8/8/2b5 b - -',Now threatening 73. Rh7+
538,18,83,7Ne7+,b'8/4nk2/5P2/5KPR/8/8/8/2b5 w - -',Black goes for the pawn for knight trade hoping to be able to blockade or win the pawn on g5.
539,18,84,7g6,b'5k2/7R/6P1/5K2/8/8/8/2b5 b - -',Looking back on this game 75. Kg6 gives me an easier win after I get my King to h7 to support the g-pawn's advance. Indeed the tablebase notes that g6 takes the most amount of moves for me to win the game
540,18,85,7Bb2,b'5k2/7R/6P1/5K2/8/8/1b6/8 w - -',Now Black sets up a blockade along the long diagonal to prevent the pawn from reaching g7
541,18,86,7Rb8+,b'1R3k2/6b1/6P1/5K2/8/8/8/8 b - -',I throw in some checks before I determine what plan of attack I want to use.
542,18,87,7Rf7+,b'5k2/5Rb1/6P1/5K2/8/8/8/8 b - -',79. Kg5 is a much easier win. The point of this move is that if the Bishop moves away from it's post on g7 it allows White's king to go to h6 on its way to h7 to force the pawn through. Now I went from a win in 12 to a win in 24.
543,18,88,8Kg5,b'6k1/5Rb1/6P1/6K1/8/8/8/8 b - -',At this point I hit an analysis block on how to proceed. I became worried that I wouldn't find the way to win. However the more I looked at the position I had an epiphany to find the way to win. It revolved around exploiting the awkward position of the Black King. I knew if I could get my King to g6 the constant threat of mate along the back rank would force Black to block with his bishop and I could make a quiet move to force zugzwang.
544,18,89,8g7,b'6k1/1R4P1/8/6K1/8/2b5/8/8 b - -',! The way to win
545,18,90,8Kh7,b'8/1R4Pk/8/6K1/8/2b5/8/8 w - -',82... Bxg7?? 83. Kg6! and Black's best is after 83... Be5 ( 83... Bf8 84. Rb8 and Black is about to be mated. 83...Kf8 84. Rb8+ just loses the bishop) 84. Re7 Bd6 85. Re8+ Bf8 but 86. Rd8! is Zugzwang)
546,18,91,Ba1,b'8/1R4Pk/8/5K2/8/8/8/b7 w - -',83...Bxg7 is still unplayable after 84. Kg5! and Black cannot prevent the White King from making it to the g6 square.
547,18,92,8Rb1,b'8/6Pk/8/5K2/8/8/8/bR6 b - -',Now White uses the vulnerability of the Bishop to get his rook to support the g-pawn
548,18,93,Bxg7,b'8/6bk/8/5K2/8/8/8/6R1 w - -',If 85... Kg8 86. Kg6 is the winner again. 86... Bxg7 87. Rc1! and Black cannot avoid losing after 88. Rc8+
549,18,94,8Rh1+,b'8/6bk/8/5K2/8/8/8/7R b - -',Now Black is forced back!
550,18,95,8Kg8,b'6k1/6b1/8/5K2/8/8/8/7R w - -',86... Bh6 87. Kf6 and it's a similar zugzwang! Black must step back and lose the bishop. 
551,18,96,8Kg6,b'6k1/6b1/6K1/8/8/8/8/7R b - -',White's King makes its grand enterance to the g6 square
552,18,97,8Kf8,b'5k2/6b1/6K1/8/8/8/8/7R w - -',If the Bishop moves  like after 87... Bd4 88. Rd1 Bb6 89. Rb1 Bc7 90. Rc1 the rook cannot be prevented from the 8th rank any further.
553,18,98,8Rf1+,b'5k2/6b1/6K1/8/8/8/8/5R2 b - -',White cannot allow the Bishop to move out of g7 or else the win is lost.
554,18,99,8Rc1,b'6k1/6b1/6K1/8/8/8/8/2R5 b - -',The rook cannot be deterred from the 8th rank!
555,18,100,9Rc8,b'2R2bk1/8/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',Black is mated after 90... Kh8 91. Rh8#  All in all I felt like this was one of the more interesting games I have ever played. I used the initiative as compensation for my early material deficit and obtained a winning endgame which I proceeded to falter from until the end where precise calculation was needed.

The rhythm of play gives me the chance to think the strategy and tactics (and analyze the position in boards). The game in question is very interesting my opponent and me alternates the initiative in the game. I'm pleased if you (all levels please) comment the game or criticized my (or my opponents) moves. I don't use pmca if you see tactical errors please comment!.

I was thinking in QGD Capablanca variation where the rook is in c1 and pawn in c6  I remembered than is play Qc2 c5 is stronger; thus with pawn in c6 I can play a better variation of QGD. But if that's true I was wrong with the plan.

Black threats open the e-column... if black exchanges the rooks with the white king far of the queenside black can win with c5 advance (creates a passed pawn). Now the white e-pawn is weak; the better option is now 33 Kf2 and if 33 ... e5 34 dxe5 fxe5 35 f5 h5 (else 34 g4) 34 e4 where white closes the center with advantage 34... Rf8 35 g4 hxg4 36 Kg3.

Qh4+ is answered with Kf1 and the queen can take f4 with check (and e4 too) but I believe than that capture gives to the white tempos and attack by the open lanes. Obviously 3 Nf3 is a good alternative (I played this move in several games in this mini-tournament and I comment my game with jimmysaylor with this move). May be 3 Qf3 adding pressure in d5 and f7 is a playable move.

I offer now a pawn for development but for example white can play without fear 4 fxe5 Qh5+ 5 Kf1 Qxe4 6 d3 Qxe5 7 Nf3 and now the e-column is open and white has big advantage in development. Of course black has another alternatives for her fifth move. Black must create a plan with the move d5 freeing the bishops!

686,24,0,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1p1p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This is a sicilian variation I sometimes like to do. It is the Rossolimo Variation. The main ideas of the Rossolimo are rapid development and seizing the initiative.  I have seen several games by Rossolimo himself and have come to admire this variation of the Sicilian.  When Rossolimo originally started playing 3.Bb5 he wanted to castle as early as move four and then go on the attack.
687,24,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1p1pn2/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',At this point white is ahead in development and black has moved too many pawns in the opening. This usually results in problems in tempo.

Tempo is not a term we higher rated players throw around. We must move 1 or 2 pawns develop all minor pieces (Bishops and Knights) off of the back rank and castle the king to safety. Of course we must parry any threats along the way put forth by our opponent. The pawns should either occupy the central squares or allow for the development of our minor pieces to influence it (as when we fianchetto a bishop for example to g2 g7 or b2 b7). I do commend stealth-invader for putting forth a valiant effort and some of his moves do indicate he is capable of being a great player.

I joined only as all players were of rating around 1800 hence was OK. But with interesting positions I think this defence is very playable. This also turned out to be one of the good interesting games I played in recent times.

Thought for a long time for advancing my pawns near king. But saw no immediate danger. Would have been very interesting game if he would have played h4 instead of castling subsequently.

I had plans to play e5. King needed safe squire. His N was threatening to come to e5. If he succeeds he will not get direct access as King protects g6 squire. White diagonal from h7 to c2 is protected by my f pawn which can be supported by N and B in matter of a move each. Grim battle for the center of the board was on cards.

Instead of taking f pawn I take important d pawn with threat to kill c pawn. I had plan to block advancement of f pawn for control white squire diagonal however this is not going to be easy. 
712,25,6,1Nc4,b'r1bq1r2/pp1n2bk/2pn3p/5Pp1/2Np4/1QPN2P1/PP4BP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Error. With this game leads to variation not comfortable for white. Proper would have  been Qc2 or Bh3 or g4. But with this he looses a pawn at c3.
713,25,7,dxc3,b'r1bq1r2/pp4bk/1np4p/5Pp1/1Q6/2pN2P1/PP4BP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Now if N moves I kill b2 pawn and get a connected passer pawn and favorable end game.

867,32,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Though the Caro-Kann and I had somewhat of a falling out a little way ago because I kept getting in traps and tactics from white I began to believe in its power again after I won a wonderful game against a street chess hustler in Kiev. 
868,32,1,Nxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I was playing Nd7 here before which is favored by Karpov one of my heroes. But I don't think it was really to my taste and I finally switched to the main line. 
869,32,2,Qb6,b'r3kbnr/pp1nppp1/1qp4p/7P/3P4/3Q1NN1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',All moves have been standard until this move. This is a lesser-known continuation but I thought it gave black more counterplay than usual. The black queen eyes the e4 and b2 pawns while allowing queenside castling and the eventual joining of rooks. More common is Ngf6 or e6. 
870,32,3,1O-O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1pp1/1qp1pn1p/7P/3P4/1P1Q1NN1/PBP2PP1/2KR3R b kq -',An interesting progression: though white is a bit open on the queenside he still castles there. This shows that White is ready for a fight. 
871,32,4,Bxg3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/1qp1pn1p/7P/2PP4/1P1Q1Nb1/PB3PP1/2KR3R w kq -',Though I usually prefer bishops over knights in most positions I thought that giving my opponent a worse pawn structure was a good idea. In retrospect though I think this capture was not so beneficial as it opens up the f-file so white can attack my king more readily. To avoid the fork on c5 better was probably Bf4+.
872,32,5,Qa5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/q6P/2PP4/1P1Q1NP1/PB4P1/2KR3R w kq -',Making a double attack on the h5 and a2 pawns though after a supposed Nxh5 black can easily counter with Bc3. A better move was probably castling or Rc8/Rd8. 
873,32,6,1Qf3,b'r2r2k1/ppqn1pp1/2p1pn1p/4N2P/2PP4/1PB2QP1/P5P1/1K1R3R b - -',Now it becomes clear that taking the knight before on g3 was not a smart choice. The f-file is successfully being used by white and his plan is quite clear.
874,32,7,1Nxe5,b'r2r2k1/ppq2pp1/2p1pn1p/4n2P/2PP4/1PB2QP1/P5P1/1K1R3R w - -',I eliminate the knight so his attacking material and power lessens. 
875,32,8,b6,b'r2r2k1/p1q2pp1/1pp1p2p/4P1nP/2P3P1/1PB5/P3Q1P1/1K1R3R w - -',Now that I gained a tempo I start progressing with my own attack on the queenside. 
876,32,9,2Rd2,b'r2r2k1/p1q2pp1/1pp1p2p/4P1nP/2P3P1/1PB5/P2RQ1P1/1K5R b - -',White chooses to attack now in the center since my knight controls the f7 square easily. 
877,32,10,c5,b'r2r2k1/2q2pp1/1p2p2p/p1p1P1nP/2P3P1/BP6/P2RQ1P1/1K1R4 w - -',At this point or somewhere around this point I offered a draw believing that both of us had no chances to move forward with any advantage. Obviously my opponent refused the draw offer. 
878,32,11,Qe7,b'2rr1k2/4qpp1/1p1Rp2p/p1p1P2P/2P2QP1/1P4P1/P7/1K1R4 w - -',Exchanging queens would definitely be in his favor so I come back to keep my drawing chances alive. White has an imposing position though it is unclear as to what he is supposed to do. 
879,32,12,3Qd2,b'2rr2k1/4qpp1/1p1Rp2p/p1p1P2P/2P3P1/1P4P1/PK1Q4/3R4 b - -',I think this may have been a fault of white. This allows my queen more freedom after the exchange that follows. 
880,32,13,3Qxd6,b'2r3k1/4qpp1/1p1Qp2p/p1p1P2P/2P3P1/1P4P1/PK6/3R4 b - -',White wants to hunt the b6 pawn but actually this move is a serious miscalculation. Black gains winning chances with this move as white gives away the g5 square which my queen can occupy with great effect. If white took with the pawn instead black would gain the pawn eventually by the king maneuvering to f7-e6 after a pawn advances.
881,32,14,3Qg5,b'2r3k1/5pp1/1p1Qp2p/p1p1P1qP/2P3P1/1P4P1/PK6/3R4 w - -',I think White did not see this continuation and counted on an exchange on d6 or my defense of the b6 pawn. 
882,32,15,3Ka3,b'2r3k1/5pp1/1p1Qp2p/p1p1P1qP/2P3P1/KP4P1/P7/3R4 b - -',White cannot defend the g4 pawn and taking the b6 pawn leads to capturing on e6 with check and ensuing tactics or taking on g4 with an attack on the rook. 
883,32,16,Rd4,b'6k1/5pp1/1p2p2p/p1p1P3/2Pr2P1/KPq5/P3Q3/3R4 w - -',I enjoy paralyzing moves like these. White has no good continuations - there is tactics that can happen with Qb6+ and Rd2 if the rook moves away - if Qb2 then checkmate on b6 with the queen - if black exchanges rooks I get a dangerous passed pawn. 
884,32,17,Qe3,b'6k1/5pp1/1p2p2p/p3P3/2PpQ1P1/KP2q3/P7/8 w - -',"(!)  I saw that white could get some counterplay with Qa8 then Qe4+ with me pushing g6 eventually and getting in trouble with a possible perpetual on f6-d8. With this move I secure my passed pawn's future while cutting out white's counterplay. 

Though my opponent had some right to refuse my draw offer as he had some chances still in retrospect he should have been more wary my possible counterplay. 

My play was inaccurate at some points and led to my opponent gaining tempo and the momentum. Though at the right time near the end I played fairly on point and didn't give my opponent rest until I had a large advantage. It shows that even though a game seems drawn or even worse for oneself it can turn out to be the opposite with special attention to accuracy.

Moving the knight to f4 threatens the white queen for just one half move and the game ends shortly after that. So black's best move is to take the knight.

It is better to take the h6 pawn because even if black takes the unprotected f5 pawn the queen might get the knight as a prize in return.

Black could have blocked the white bishop with the d-pawn followed by another pawn to c6 one move later to support the d-pawn. That would relieve the pressure on the f7 pawn and allow it to take the queen on g6. If black moved the d pawn this move instead I would have moved my queen to h6.
