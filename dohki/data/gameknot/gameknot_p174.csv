125,7,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/1pp2p2/p2pp1pp/8/2PPPP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Pushing 4 pawns is always aggressive. It is laying a claim on the center. It does not guarantee an advantage it merely attacks the center. One point of blitz is to pressure your opponent so he must take time to defend and then run into time trouble.
126,7,2,Be3,b'rnbqk1nr/1pp2pb1/p2pp1pp/8/2PPPP2/2N1BN2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',One can already feel the buildup of the center. At this point I'd say neither side has a true advantage except in the preference of your playing style. Black needs to be careful to not be pushed off the board as well as to consolidate his development. White needs to not over-extend. White needs to pressure with his lead in development otherwise black will become solid in defense

Not all the moves were forced of course I mean this is blitz and I'm no chess celebrity but if I took the rook for the knight my attack would have lost momentum and it may have been a battle to finish the game. This ended the game without any risk of counter-attack. If your opponent has to trade the position to keep himself alive question yourself before taking any available pieces there may be something stronger lurking...

237,10,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes between myself Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend Ananya (ananyapathak). So Ananya I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess my favorite game. First I want to say there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men ""OK there are 10000 of us. I want 9000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9000 at the top attack them. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say ""When you engage in hand to hand combat use the long swords as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though."" That is a tactic not a strategy. Strategies give general direction tactics are more specific. So in our game for example part of my strategy in the middle game was to force you to trade off your DSB then infiltrate the h6 square and attack your g6 square to open your king to attack. That's strategy my basic game plan. Tactics were putting my bishop on h6 to trade bishops push my h pawn to make space for my knight to go to h2 then g4 to bring my queen to h6 to push my pawn to trade on g6 ect. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say ""Ananya this guys is leading you wrong."" It's not that I'm leading you wrong but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive! So when taking advise (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible then make a rational decision for yourself based on your own style and abilities what is for you."
238,10,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So at this stage in the game I thought we were going into the KID. I was looking forward to a intense battle as this defense gives a lot of tactical opportunities for both sides.
239,10,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',"So on your 2nd move I was wrong. Your playing the Grunfeld Defense. According to MCO the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. 

I found this very encouraging because I know that a very slight advantage if played accurately becomes a great advantage which in turn if worked correctly becomes a won game."
240,10,3,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"So I chose to play the Grunfeld Defense Exchange Variation. In this variation Black willingly allows White to establish an imposing pawn center with intention of attacking and destroying that center! So it's an intense debate between the 2 sides a debate won not with words but in tactical chess moves. White says ""My solid pawn center will restrict your pieces giving me a superior position!"" Black says ""Your pawns are weak! I'll use my pawns to destroy your weak pawn center! I will undermine those overly advanced pawns and trade them off and gain a free open position!"" What I find is interesting is if White succeeds in keeping this ""strong"" pawn center he will definitely have the better game. Yet if black accomplishes his goal of undermining and trading off White's pawns in my opinion he will probably gain equality but he still has a major fight to gain superiority! This is why I love to play White against the Grunfeld."
241,10,4,bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"So now I have my solid pawn center! It's your job to prove my pawns are not as strong as I think they are. Your tactics should include c5 which you did on move 8 and c5xd4 which you never did. To attack my LSB you played c4 (move 16). Since pawns can't move backwards you would never again get the chance to play c5xd4! Thus my pawns on c3 & d4 were pretty secure. As my attack developed I saw opportunity to use my LSB to attack g6 were it not for the e4 pawn. So I had to push this pawn & trade it off to open the line. Once I did this you had no more pawns to use in your attack against my center. The c-pawn was overly advanced and can't attack the center. The d & f pawns were traded off. The e-pawn was blocked behind my knight on e5 and can't attack the center. So the only remaining pawn that could attack my center was the b pawn by advancing to b4 and capturing c3. My move Rb1 (which I made more for attacking purposes than to stop the pawn) permanently kept him at bay though. To see the details of the position I just described look at 27. Ne5. ****************************************************************
So I won the debate I spoke of. The only pawn that was eliminated was the one I chose to trade off to open lines for my attack."
242,10,5,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',So you begin your attack on my pawns.

PxN or NxN then you play QxB. So I've won a pawn but my own pawn structure is pretty bad. Given the chance I would not have played Bxe7 as it violates my strategy in this opening: to maintain a solid overbearing pawn center. Instead I would have played 13. Qe3 (as I actually played) and followed my expected plan.
244,10,7,1Qe3,b'r1b1r1k1/p1qnppbp/1p4p1/2p3B1/3PP3/2P1QN2/P3BPPP/1R3RK1 b - -',13. Qe3 has the triple purpose of 1: Making space for 14. Bd3 since I figured you would play 13. Bb7 2: To get my queen on the c1-h6 diagonal to prepare for Bh6 and 3. To possibly chase your queen from the b8-h2 diagonal which I never chose to do. It's good to give yourself options though.
245,10,8,e6,b'r3r1k1/pbqn1pbp/1p2p1p1/2p3B1/3PP3/2PBQN2/P4PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I did not understand the purpose for this move. I was expecting cxd4 followed by e5. Hit at my pawns!
246,10,9,f6,b'r3r1k1/pbqn2bp/1p2ppp1/2p3B1/3PP3/2PBQN2/P4PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',This move weakens your g6 square. As you saw later in the game you could not defend that square enough so I won a pawn. I can't say you should never advance pawns in front of your king but when you do proceed with caution. When you made this move with my bishop on d3 I immediately started looking for ways to hit g6.
247,10,10,1Bh6,b'r3r1k1/pbqn2bp/1p2pppB/2p5/3PP3/2PBQN2/P4PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',If you trade here with BxB it would be very bad for you as I get my queen easily in your house an uninvited guest sitting in your favorite reclining chair in your living room. It is better to wait as you did making me trade on g7.
248,10,11,1c4,b'r3r1k1/pbqn2bp/1p2pppB/8/2pPP3/2PBQN2/P4PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',(???) This move helps me to keep my pawn center intact. I'd say cxd4 is good. I'd still have the d & e pawns but without the c pawn supporting the d pawn my pawn center is somewhat weaker. On the kingside though since you did not take our DSB's actually block my queen from getting in I decided to trade bishops and devise another way in to g6.
249,10,12,1a4,b'r3r3/1bqn2kp/pp2ppp1/8/P1pPP3/2P1QN2/2B2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - a3',While I maintain my pawn center and prepare to attack your king-side I need to prevent any counters on your queen-side. I don't want you to play b5.
250,10,13,Nf8,b'r3rn2/2q3kp/ppb1ppp1/8/P1pPP3/2P2N2/2BQ1PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',(???) Deserting the center. The knight is needed to control e5 and especially to defend c6. As you saw later as I pursued my attack the knight was needed back on d7. You moved him back on move 24.
251,10,14,2h4,b'r3rn2/2q3kp/ppb1ppp1/8/P1pPP2P/2P2N2/2BQ1PP1/1R2R1K1 b - h3',Now I start my plan to get my queen on h6 and hit g6. The pawn push has the twofold purpose: 1. opening h2 so the knight can go to a2 then g4 to support the queen move to h6; 2. Preparing for h5 to attack g6. I mentioned on your move 15 that you need to be careful when pushing pawns in front of your king. Here my pawn push does not give me any concerns as the pawns on f2 & g2 support the squares e3f3g3 & h3. I see no way in for you to attack my king.
252,10,15,2b5,b'r3rn2/2q3kp/p1b1ppp1/1p6/P1pPP2P/2P2N2/2BQ1PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',I'm sure you had no idea of the attack I was about launch or you would not push queenside pawns.

Once there with no pawns to attack it he would be a stronghold for the rest of the game. You had no DSB to try to trade off and your knight has no easy way to attack e5. Your knight is forced back to d7 to defend f6. If instead you play f5 then Nf6 wins the exchange. After 24.	e5 Nd7 25. Qh6+ Kg8 26. exf6 Nxf6 27. Ne5 the knight has entered your private space and he'll refuse to leave.

I don't see why the knight would be a greater threat than the bishop. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped closed positions while bishops are stronger in open positions. So you have to consider each game individually but generally as pieces get traded off closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up the bishops become stronger and stronger. So although both pieces are technically the same value the bishops are my piece of choice. I would not have traded if I were you. Now I have 2 bishops to go into the endgame while you have a bishop and a knight. That may be just a personal thing though because while most strong chess players agree with me I've met some who disagree."

315,13,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I often enjoy playing the Caro-Kann with the early bishop development and which sometimes transposes to pawn structures reminiscent of the French defense. 
316,13,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I know this isn't the book line and it seems to develop a piece that is later going to lose tempo.
317,13,3,a4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/1B1p4/P2P4/5N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq a3',Looking a bit controversial.  The move has ideas of opening the a file if black moves the knight and takes on b5.  But b4 and potentially b3 are looking weak for white.

Now maybe f4 is an option. Making Bf3 possible. Will create a vulnerable e4 field though but developing my Bishop which now seems to be doomed to hide behind my pawns.

That would leave me with the black horse on e4 supported by a pawn on f5 and increasing pressure on the queen-side. So I'll try and hold the weak e3-pawn and try to create counter-play along the h1-a8 diagonal.

Bf3 will be met by Ne4 then Qc2 to counter-attack the e4-position. Then f5 will be played. All h1-a8 pressure-plans will be dead in the water. The Bishop will not be very useful then but if I'm quick I just might be able to burst open the b-file or at least create a weak spot there.

But since his bishop is now blocking his b-file I can try to open up the queenside.  His rooks will now not be able to defend the b-file since the bishop is in the way.

But he'll have to guard it. My b-pawn is very vulnerable now but can be defended. I also have to watch d3 (just as he needs to watch d7). He'll probably will play Qxb5. I can meet that witch Rfb1.
387,15,34,2axb5,b'rr4k1/1b4pp/4p3/1p1qNp2/2pPnP2/2P1PB2/2Q3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Now initiating the exchange of the Rooks makes a1 weak. Black will dominate along the a8-h1 diagonal and the a-file. Because of his reorganisation of troops the centre/kingside becomes interesting again. I'll try to get some pressure off by removing his Knight (my Bishop isn't doing much anyway).
388,15,35,2Bxe4,b'rr4k1/1b4pp/4p3/1p1qNp2/2pPBP2/2P1P3/2Q3PP/R4RK1 b - -',"So remove the knight. If he recaptures by means of the pawn he'll have a doubled pawn (weak) and if he recaptures by means of the Queen exchanging Queens will favour white at this point. Well maybe. Since the Bishop is still there. That might become too powerful. My knight has an excellent position but isn't doing very much right now. I need to be sure blacks Bishop is ""out of the game"" before exchanging queens."

Also the blocking of the black d-pawn by the Knight is important. Besides g2 there's also the thread of b4 being played. Ra1 at least buys some time to deal with that.
396,15,43,3Qf3,b'6k1/1b4pp/3rp3/1p2Np2/2pPqP2/2P1PQ2/6PP/R5K1 b - -',Time has come to exchange the queens. That is I expect black to start the trade. If black would withdraw to for example d5 black is bound to loose material.
397,15,44,3g6,b'6k1/1b5p/3rp1p1/1p2Np2/2pPqP2/2P1PQ2/6PP/R5K1 w - -',Apparently black is not interested in initiating the exchange. Even if there is a chance I will opt for the double-pawn. e5 is mine and will remain so but I might be frightened to leave it. Black is not leaving all that to chance. His bishop will stand better at d4. At least I assume he won't go for a double pawn.
398,15,45,3Qxe4,b'6k1/1b5p/3rp1p1/1p2Np2/2pPQP2/2P1P3/6PP/R5K1 b - -',Ok I'll take it. His Bishop won't have such a crashing position. My wall of pawns is all on black squares. Subsequently his blocking pawns are on the white fields blocking his bishop. B4 is a move that I need to take into account.
399,15,46,3Ra5,b'6k1/7p/3rp1p1/Rp2Np2/2pPbP2/2P1P3/6PP/6K1 b - -',"So recapturing with the pawn. Attacking b-pawn seems a good idea. If defended by the bishop the b-pawn will be mine. Bc6 Kxc6 Rxc6 Rxb5 and then black's c and e-pawn are weak.
If defended by the rook at b6 the pawn will probably fall too. Defense by the rook on d5 will block black's bishop."
400,15,47,3Nd7,b'6k1/3N3p/1r2p1p1/Rp3p2/2pPbP2/2P1P3/6PP/6K1 b - -',Now I can attack the rook. If the rook moves to b7 I can move my rook to a8 for example. If then the king moves to g7 f.e. I can move the knight to c5 to fork rook and bishop. This would also allow for an attack on the e-pawn and/or h-pawn. 
401,15,48,3Rd6,b'6k1/3N3p/3rp1p1/Rp3p2/2pPbP2/2P1P3/6PP/6K1 w - -',Black apparently wants to keep things going and actively defend his position so I won't get the upperhand.
402,15,49,3Ra7,b'6k1/R2N3p/3rp1p1/1p3p2/2pPbP2/2P1P3/6PP/6K1 b - -',I will just try that: keep black locked in and find new target as much as possible. Kf6 will make h7 a target. Also the possibility is created to exchange the bishop. Don't know if I would want that since it's only an obstacle for me in getting on the 7-rank AND the f-file at the same time. Of course I can hope for Bc6 Kf6+ Kh8 and Rxh7 mate. But I don't believe it will happen that easy.

So I'll play h3. Not h4. Maybe I will want to play Kg3 Kh3 g3 Kh4 Kg5 and slowly move in there. Still a bit worried about b5-b4.

I.c. of Kf8 or Kh8 I''ll grab the pawn at g6+. So I guess he'll move Kg8. Then I play g5 first. hxg5. Then fxg5. That pawn has a great spot there. And there is the point to break through. On the other hand my defense is not getting any stronger.

The idea is to reduce the available cases to the Black King in preparation of an attack from the back in a8. For this attack I need an additional move ie Rook d1-d8 and during this additional move the Black King could escape through a6 and then b5. But with my Pawn in b5 he cannot go to a6 and must remain where he is. Whether he then takes my Pawn in b5 with his Pawn from c6 or his Rook from b5 (as he actually did) should be irrelevant because the King in either way does not move forward.""

brightalien's thoughts on regarding the move: 

""If my analysis is correct in cases 28.1 28.4 28.5 and 28.6 I was able to force the checkmate within 3 to 7 moves in case 28.2 depending on his 29. reply a checkmate or an advantage of material and in case 28.3 just a material advantage.

Therefore his decision to go for 28.1 (taking my Rook) according to my analysis was probably a mistake. In his condition I would have played 28.3 accepting a disadvantage rather than a checkmate. But playing this way the continuation would have been

28. gxf3 Qxh3+
29. Kg1 Bf4
30. Re3 Rf6
31. Ne2 Rg6+
32. Ng3 Bxg3
33. f4 Qh2+
34. Kf1 Qxf2 checkmate

with the two variants

30.1 Nd5 Qh2+
31.1 Kf1 Qh1 checkmate

33.2 fxg3 Rxg3+
34.2 Kf2 Qg2 checkmate

another option 30.3 Rd2 instead Re3 would have not changed the result just the sequence of my attack.

Basically the idea was to either attack with Queen+Bishop or Queen+Rook depending whether or not he decided to use his Knight for the defense.""

715,23,12,Nc3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White forgoes the option of winning material. It looks very tempting. After Qxb7 it looks like the a8 rook is lost but black has a saving resource Qb4+ cutting his losses to a pawn. The point is although white wins a pawn he loses his initiative and Morphy didn't like that.
716,23,13,c6,b'rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',now the pawn is protected. White now needs to prove his initiative is worth more than the pawn. He must play very very actively. What move is the best?

If the bishop moves to safety then black's position would be completely saved. For example 10.Be2 allows black to get his queen out of the way and get the bishop out and 0-0. 
If this had happened in the game it would have been a miracle for black. However there is a principle:
""There cannot be a safe move that the opponent makes to attack you when you are developed.and he is not."" This move completely violates this. GMs call this ""suicide chess"".  What move did white play here?"

737,24,6,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2PPP1n1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Inconsistent with his earlier moves. I would play 6 B-K3 instead. Black can win a Pawn in the ensuing exchanges but I end up a Pawn ahead anyway after the move actually played and 6 B-K3 would enable White to maintain strong central Pawns as compensation.

White seemed to have a betetr line with 12 BxB QxB 13 Q-Q1 keeping the Queens on the board and ensuring the fall of the advanced QP. Now I can play for an endgame advantage.

793,25,13,1g5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/4p1P1/2q1P3/2B2P2/PP1Q3P/2KR4 b kq -',Politely asking the Knight to take a hike.
794,25,14,1Nh5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/8/4p1Pn/2q1P3/2B2P2/PP1Q3P/2KR4 w kq -',And he obliges.  Better is...Qxa2 and after gxf6 then ...Qa1+ and Black has some counter play. (edited on 8.11.10 - thank you for the correction)

796,26,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Ruy Lopez one of my favorite openings.
797,26,1,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Bird's Defense a playable but unusual variant.
798,26,2,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I of course capture. I was expecting a response of PxN.
799,26,3,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p7/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Very surprising. It does win back the piece as I have two pieces attacked by Black Pawns but it enables me to gain a Pawn in the process. I could also have won a Pawn by 5 BxP ch as opposed to my actual line.
800,26,4,Nxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/8/1p2N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I choose to win the KP instead of the QP.
801,26,5,Nf3,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp1qppp/3p4/1p6/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Technically Black could now win back the pawn with 8..QxP ch but he would be behind in development and his Q would be highly exposed.
802,26,6,Bxf3,b'r3kbnr/1pp1qppp/3p4/1p6/3PP3/5b1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This exchange helps me as I now secure my Pawn plus with the completion of it.
803,26,7,Qd7,b'r3kbnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/1p6/3PP3/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Now my strategy will be to develop secure my King and swap down playing for the endgame. 
804,26,8,1Bg5,b'r3kbnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/1p4B1/3PP3/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Since my Knight will have to go to Q2 I move the Bishop out first to avoid blocking it in.
805,26,9,1f6,b'r3kbnr/1ppq2pp/3p1p2/1p4B1/3PP3/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Unnecessary and impedes the development of Black's Knight.
806,26,10,1Be3,b'r3kbnr/1ppq2pp/3p1p2/1p6/3PP3/4BQ1P/PPP2PP1/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Now both my advanced central Pawns are secure.

809,26,13,1Nd2,b'r3kbnr/1pp3pp/3p1p2/1p6/2qPP3/2P1BQ1P/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',My development is now almost complete. I just need to connect my Rooks.

811,26,15,1Qe2,b'r3kbnr/1pp3pp/3p1p2/1p6/3PP3/2PqB2P/PP1NQPP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Being ahead one Pawn I gladly offer the exchange of Queens.

813,26,17,1Kxe2,b'r3kbnr/1pp3pp/3p1p2/1p6/3PP3/2P1B2P/PP1NKPP1/R6R b kq -',We've reached the endgame phase. I'm a Pawn up with better-developed pieces a central space advantage better Pawn structure and a centralized King. I'm feeling quite ebullient about my chances.
814,26,18,1b3,b'r3kb1r/1pp3pp/3p1pn1/1p6/3PP3/1PP1B1PP/P2NKP2/R6R b kq -',I'm steadily pushing my Pawns forward. There's no hurry since with the Queens gone Black can do little of consequence.

818,26,22,2Rxa1,b'4k2r/2p1b1pp/1p1p1pn1/1P6/3PP3/1PP1B1PP/3NKP2/R7 b k -',My opponent does me a favor. Now the game is simplified more and I'm up two Pawns instead of one and control the only open file.
819,26,23,2f4,b'5rk1/2p1b1pp/1p1p1pn1/1P6/3PPP2/1PP1B1PP/3NK3/R7 b - f3',Slowly but inexorably my Pawns grind onward.
820,26,24,2Nh8,b'5rkn/2p1b1pp/1p1p1p2/1P6/3PPP2/1PP1B1PP/3NK3/R7 w - -',A maneuver to reposition the Knight but Black's position will remain cramped.
821,26,25,Nf7,b'5rk1/2p1bnpp/1p1p1p2/1P6/2PPPP2/1P2B1PP/3NK3/R7 w - -',Maneuver completed. It didn't help much.
822,26,26,2b4,b'5rk1/2p1bnpp/1p1p1p2/1P6/1PPPPP2/4B1PP/3NK3/R7 b - -',I'm aiming to create a passed Pawn.
823,26,27,dxc5,b'5rk1/4bnpp/1p3p2/1Pp5/2PPPP2/4B1PP/3NK3/R7 w - -',I could create one here with P-Q5 but I see a possibility of more exchanging down.
824,26,28,bxc5,b'5rk1/5npp/5p2/1Pp5/2P1PP2/6PP/3NK3/R7 w - -',Now I have a protected passed Pawn on QN5 and another set of pieces has come off.
825,26,29,2Nb3,b'5rk1/5npp/5p2/1Pp5/2P1PP2/1N4PP/4K3/R7 b - -',Pressuring Black's Q-side and tying down his remaining pieces.
826,26,30,Nd8,b'2rn2k1/6pp/5p2/1Pp5/2P1PP2/1N4PP/4K3/3R4 w - -',Now if I play 30 R-Q5 30...N-N2 defends the Pawn. 
827,26,31,3Ke3,b'2rn2k1/6pp/5p2/1Pp5/2P1PP2/1N2K1PP/8/3R4 b - -',I see that I cannot yet win the black QBP which would give me two connected passed pawns and be decisive so I elect to strengthen my position by centralizing and advancing my King.
828,26,32,3g4,b'2r3k1/1n4pp/5p2/1Pp5/2P1PPP1/1N2K2P/8/3R4 b - -',With Black tied down on the Q-side I attempt to divert the defenders with a K-side demonstration.
829,26,33,Re8,b'4r1k1/1n5p/5pp1/1Pp1P3/2P2PP1/1N2K2P/8/3R4 w - -',I get his Rook to move. However as the move pins my KP I have to be a little bit careful.
830,26,34,3Rd7,b'4r1k1/1n1R3p/5pp1/1Pp1P3/2P2PP1/1N2K2P/8/8 b - -',Black's Rook is overburdened. He must now defend his Knight but in the process he lets my KP become a second passed Pawn.
831,26,35,3Rb8,b'1r4k1/1n1R3p/5pp1/1Pp1P3/2P2PP1/1N2K2P/8/8 w - -',Forced to avoid losing either the Knight or the QBP.

833,26,37,3e7,b'4r1k1/1n1RP2p/5pp1/1Pp5/2P2PP1/1N2K2P/8/8 b - -',With the Pawn now on K7 I have too many threats. I can now capture the Knight with my Rook and still keep the Pawn guarded. Black moves his Rook enabling me to simplify the position to a winning endgame.
834,26,38,3Rd8+,b'r2R2k1/1n2P2p/5pp1/1Pp5/2P2PP1/1N2K2P/8/8 b - -',Black now has no choice. The Rooks come off the board.
835,26,39,3Nxc5,b'3n2k1/7p/5pp1/1PN5/2P2PP1/4K2P/8/8 b - -',Now the two connected passed Pawns which was the long-term goal I had been aiming at for many moves will decide the issue.
836,26,40,4Kd5,b'3n4/3k3p/N4pp1/1P1K4/2P2PP1/7P/8/8 b - -',With my King now in a supporting position the Pawns can begin their advance.
837,26,41,4c6+,b'3n4/3k3p/N1P2pp1/1P1K4/5PP1/7P/8/8 b - -',This Pawn defends QN7 and the Knight guards QN8 allowing the QNP to sweep towards the finish line.
838,26,42,Ne6,b'8/4k2p/NPP1npp1/3K4/5PP1/7P/8/8 w - -',Black can only watch.

886,28,37,3Qe6+,b'2r2qk1/4n1p1/p3Q2p/1p2P3/1p6/P4N2/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',And this is why it was the best: white recuperates a pawn!
887,28,38,3Qxa3,b'2r2q1k/4n1p1/7p/1p2P3/8/Q4N2/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',so as a result white has still a pawn in front. But black has recuperated air and now has a beatiful b-pawn far from the white king. By now tension has been very high. From now it will be higher!!!

892,28,43,3Qd2,b'2r1q2k/6p1/7p/1p2P3/5n2/5N2/3Q1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',of course!
893,28,44,3Ne6,b'2r1q2k/6p1/4n2p/1p2P3/8/5N2/3Q1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',And so I can block his pawn for a while! That was my real purpose.
894,28,45,3Qd5,b'2r1q2k/6p1/4n2p/1p1QP3/8/5N2/5PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Hm... i guess he wants to pre-pin my horse here.
895,28,46,3Rc5,b'4q2k/6p1/4n2p/1prQP3/8/5N2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',so i intend to active my rook
896,28,47,3Qb3,b'4q2k/6p1/4n2p/1pr1P3/8/1Q3N2/5PPP/4R1K1 b - -',good thinking: still pre-pin my horse!

900,28,51,4h3,b'7k/6p1/2q1n2p/1p2P3/2r5/4QN1P/5PP1/4R1K1 b - -',eliminating the threat of an eventual mate on line 1. Good thinking (i whisppered to myself: damn!) :-DD
901,28,52,4Kg8,b'6k1/6p1/2q1n2p/1p2P3/2r5/4QN1P/5PP1/4R1K1 w - -',so as i am no more pinned i can go with my king as it is a future attacking piece.
902,28,53,4Rd1,b'6k1/6p1/2q1n2p/1p2P3/2r5/4QN1P/5PP1/3R2K1 b - -',here is a good move: now it becomes hard to prevent Nd4 and i have to consider Rd6! So i carefully planned the next two moves.
903,28,54,4b4,b'6k1/6p1/2q1n2p/4P3/1pr5/4QN1P/5PP1/3R2K1 w - -',I want to go to b2!
904,28,55,4Rd6,b'6k1/6p1/2qRn2p/4P3/1pr5/4QN1P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',as planned: good but foreseen! I guess white expected Qc8 from an average player as myself. 
905,28,56,4Rc1+,b'6k1/6p1/2qRn2p/4P3/1p6/4QN1P/5PP1/2r3K1 w - -',but I prefer Qc4... So i played first this!

907,28,58,4Nd2,b'6k1/6p1/3Rn2p/4P3/1pq5/4Q2P/3N1PPK/2r5 b - -',unexpected but it does not matter
908,28,59,Nxf4,b'6k1/6p1/3R3p/4P3/1p3n2/7P/3N1PPK/2r5 w - -',my king is better place so I thought it compensates the lack of a pwan.
909,28,60,4g3,b'6k1/6p1/3R3p/4P3/1p3n2/6PP/3N1P1K/2r5 b - -',unepexcted because now f2 and f3 are nice target to thnk about.
910,28,61,4Ne2,b'6k1/6p1/3R3p/4P3/1p6/6PP/3NnP1K/2r5 w - -',only possibility... I guess this is why white made this: to force my knight far from e5.
911,28,62,4Rb6,b'6k1/6p1/1R5p/4P3/1p6/6PP/3NnP1K/2r5 b - -',of course! Rb1 and Rc4 are prohibited by the knight.
912,28,63,4Rc2,b'6k1/6p1/1R5p/4P3/1p6/6PP/2rNnP1K/8 w - -',So eliminate the knight. But not Rd1 because Nb4 would ruin all possible protection to my pawn!
913,28,64,4Ne4,b'6k1/6p1/1R5p/4P3/1p2N3/6PP/2r1nP1K/8 b - -',Now i cannot play Rc4 because Nd6 would be too strong. And Rb2 would be too passive...
914,28,65,4Nc3,b'6k1/6p1/1R5p/4P3/1p2N3/2n3PP/2r2P1K/8 w - -',here is what i found best: threatening to take f2 after Rxb4 Nxe4 Rxe4 with check and approaching of the king.
915,28,66,4Rc6,b'6k1/6p1/2R4p/4P3/1p2N3/2n3PP/2r2P1K/8 b - -',this is good!!!but he cannot take because the exchanges would lead to a more approaching pawn and a too far king. I have thought considerably to b3 and to Nxe4 but the white rook is still too strong.
916,28,67,4Kf7,b'8/5kp1/2R4p/4P3/1p2N3/2n3PP/2r2P1K/8 w - -',So i have to approach more my brave king.
917,28,68,5h4,b'8/5kp1/2R4p/4P3/1p2N2P/2n3P1/2r2P1K/8 b - -',this is a mistery to me. Except that he might think i am almost on zugzwang? But i am not.
918,28,69,5Rc1,b'8/5kp1/2R4p/4P3/1p2N2P/2n3P1/5P1K/2r5 w - -',freeing his f pawn but planning the exchange of the rooks.
919,28,70,Nxc1,b'8/5kp1/7p/4P3/1p2NP1P/6P1/7K/2n5 w - -',now my idea is that my b pawn will monopolize his knight and my knoght can come back to defense.
920,28,71,b2,b'8/5kp1/7p/4P3/5P1P/6PK/1p1N4/2n5 w - -',so here i am the most threatening possible. And this white king that should have come sooner to my pawn...
921,28,72,5Kg4,b'8/5kp1/7p/4P3/5PKP/6P1/1p1N4/2n5 b - -',finally moves forward: he prefers the attack always the attack! I must recognize that my polish friend is not shy: he is an attacker!

I have to admit it personally never failed to shock me so far because it is so unusual! White doesn't occupy the center but plans to do that indirectly with the dark-squared bishop which will be placed on the long diagonal soon. Another opening following that strategy which is probably more calm (because the pawn isn't placed on Black's dark-squared bishop diagonal immediately) is 1. b3 -- this is called the ""Nimzowich/Larsen Attack""."

In earlier games I preferred to play d6 instead of the last knight move to banish the opponents bishop but I figured out it would be better to perform a double-step with the pawn because it increases central control and -- for me personally more important because that often has been a problem! -- it enables my bishop to retire to d6 or e7 in case it is attacked or wants to aim for the king-side.

It looks very active to me and I usually like pinning my opponents knight with the bishop but in this case it isn't pinned at all; quite the contrary it could be dangerous for me because if White's knight moves my bishop is under attack and he threatens to win material.

However as mentioned earlier I guess the major mistake by White here was 18. f3?? so he helped me very much. On 18. Bf3 we likely would have played an ordinary overall equal endgame.

1092,33,3,Bxa6,b'rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the main tabya of the gambit. Personally I'm not a fan of gambits but someone would make a list of the most respectable and sound gambits the Benko would be pretty up on the list. Before I carry on with the rest of the game let me summarize what has Black gained for his invested material. A lead in development and more than that a better pawn structure in fact Black's only weakness is e7 which is pretty hard for White to attack. The main benefits of a better pawn structure pretty evident here. White has no useful pawn breaks pushing e4-e5 doesn't do much while pushing the Q-side pawns only creates weaknesses. Black's pawn break/advance is c4 clearing c5 for a Knight which can come to d3 or even b3 in some cases. The open files on the Q-side give Black a lot of pressure and make it difficult for White to develop his pieces his Bc1 is particularly hard to find a role in the game. There is another side benefit for Benko when it comes to blitz games. The play is very smooth so you save time on moves you don't have to memorize a lot of lines in fact I know almost no theory and in spite of that have very good results with it.
1093,33,4,e3,b'rn1qk2r/3pppbp/b4np1/2pP4/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A waste of time. How many times have you read that in an opening book or a GM commentary? It's rather easy to write that and absolve yourself from explaining more about a certain move. The other plan for White here is to fianchetto the Bf1 and keep the pawn on e2 for a while. Granted the Bishop isn't very active on g2 but unlike other gambits where the goal is to exchange pieces in order to make the extra pawn count it's very hard next to impossible to do that in this gambit simply because of Black's pressure on the Q-side. So why is this move a waste of time? The pawn belongs on either e2 or e4. On e3 it just hems the Bc1 and doesn't do much to defend the d5 pawn.
1094,33,5,1e4,b'rn1qk2r/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R b kq -',Otherwise how is White to develop?

Just because you've gambited a pawn for play on the Q-side doesn't mean you shouldn't switch over to a K-side attack if the opportunity presents itself.
1098,33,9,1a4,b'r4rk1/3nppbp/3p2p1/q1pP4/P3PBn1/2N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R5KR b - a3',A hasty move that is the mark of an inadequate plan. White thinks that by putting a Knight on b5 supported by a pawn on a4 he'll be able to neutralize the pressure. If only it were that easy...

But freezes my Nd4 also Much as like in the Marhall Attack of the Lopez (a black position that is in the ...c6 lines if BL plays f5 instead of Rook doubling on the e-file). I don't want to create counter play at the moment. Nce2 is a consideration. But his trouble here is that the Q is not the best defender since it is also an independent target as well. 
1258,37,10,1Raxd1,b'rnb2rk1/bp3ppp/p1p5/6N1/1PB5/P7/1BP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',It looks like I let him out of the bag. But WT is much better here with his strafing B-pair imo. The K-side defenders are now down to 2 the K and R. There is the immediate threat of 14.Nxf7 or 14.Bxf7 which he cannot take either or gets backrank mated. And there is something of a bind on developing his Q-side pieces at all I hope to bring more pieces to bear and try to infiltrate to win material. I'm not expecting Mate from here. So he pulls The Best Move out of his hat here ... 
1259,37,11,1Bg4,b'rn3rk1/bp3ppp/p1p5/6N1/1PB3b1/P7/1BP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Bg4! Now he has a K-side defender added with tempo in a way. Tho it does help me double Rooks so whether he has really gained a tempo depends largely whether my doubling gets done and is useful. If it is then he has not really gained much. 
1260,37,12,Nd7,b'r4rk1/bp1n1ppp/p1p5/6N1/1PB3b1/P7/1BPR1PPP/5RK1 w - -',This is his trouble tho and why I did not play Rd3 since it would have allowed his Bg6 easier. Now having played Nd7 he must stay on the diagonal with his Bg4 a bit longer. I kick it so I can double now. But he surprises me .... pleasantly however. 
1261,37,13,1Bxf7+,b'r4rk1/bp3Bpp/pnp5/6N1/1P4b1/P6P/1BPR1PP1/5RK1 b - -',Now I thought he must play Rxf7. Then I totally overlooked the powerful move Nc4 becomes playable however during the game! What a terrible thing to find post mortum! Devastating and I may never play Chess again Again! Ion is right (tho so graciously said I should never have taken those Q's off! After all it was only an extra target and bind are very fickle ... tho my game with jhfit does show a proper prosecution of a K-side bind from this very opening) or I should at least have played Bb3 Bf5 it seems. He might try h6 even for some breathing space. Tho it adds more WT sq weakness. With the Queens on that would probably be deadly as well as an h6 pawn target. 
1262,37,14,Na4,b'r4r1k/bp3Bp1/p1p4p/6N1/nP4P1/P2R4/1BP2PP1/5RK1 w - -',19....hxg5 ???

But that's blitz I'm down to 28 seconds. Now after I err with 21.Rh3 he must play a piece to d4 and then recapture if I play Bxd4 to stave off a mate awhile. Maybe long enough with my time situation. He's a good player but misses he must sac to live longer!? Maybe but I think instead he put the burdon on me to see it or whether I just ""developed"" the Rook to h3 unaware of the Sac such as to protect my Ng5 from capture. And it does not cost him a piece to find out .... The answer is expensive but quick to BL but was a quite legitimate try imo.  "
