The control of the game has shifted to Black with more of the white side of the board under Black control than the other way around.

37,0,37,2Rc8,b'2r3k1/q4pbp/b3p1p1/p5n1/1ppP4/PP2PPP1/1B4KP/RN1QR3 w - -',So I have an idea. If I can get my pawn to the last row I can threaten to Queen and if I am challenged before I can accept a Pawn for a minor piece exchange and if I am really lucky a Queen for a Pawn exchange....so I protect my Pawn with the Castle.

On s'en va vers l'Italie ou l'Espagne (ouverture italienne ou ouverture espagnole ?). Ce coup respecte deux des principes fondamentaux des ouvertures : il attaque un pion dans le centre et développe un pièce mineure (fou ou cavalier).

De toute façon on retrouve ce clouage du cavalier dans plein d'ouvertures et ce n'est pas la fin du monde. Ce coup est donc tout à fait valable. Mais ce n'est pas le coup le plus souvent joué. C'est plutôt a6 qui est joué ici 90% du temps. Mais alors les noirs ne perdent-ils pas le pion e5 après l'échange du fou blanc pour le cavalier noir? Pourtant tous les experts sont d'accord : il n'est pas vraiment bon de prendre le pion. Pourquoi?

However i felt that as my opponent has not yet moved any pieces I can afford to wait. The move also frees the f1 bishop and the queen and directly protects the c4 pawn.
279,10,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Following the good opening principles developing the knight to it's best square ready to stand in defence of his king when he castles kingside (with the queenside pawn structure as it is either side would be unwise to plan to castle long)
280,10,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Developing to a natural square
281,10,7,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is played for the same reason as my 3rd move freeing the bishop which is preventing him from castling. Black here may be thinking about early castling then ripping apart the centre with some exchanges while my king is still central. However the immediate concern is developing quickly and seeing what opportunities arise.
282,10,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Another solid move the knight stands on his best square and could move to the e5 square which is a nice outpost for him if I get the chance to attack
283,10,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Again a solid move. Black delays bringing his bishops out until he has a better idea of where they should go which is normally dictated by the game rather than a set principle like the knights.
284,10,10,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Brings the first bishop out to the centre. From here he looks towards blacks kingside and can easily move round to the queenside if needed. The more modest Be2 may be better if there is a threat of Bg4 pinning the knight however with the pawn on e6 there is no such threat.
285,10,11,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Copying the move and for the same reason. Both sides can now castle when ready.
286,10,12,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I chose to develop my final minor piece ahead of castling there is little difference between either choice and on another day I may well have castled instead of delaying it for a few moves.
287,10,13,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Castle often castle early is the advice which black duly follows. with his king safe he can now consider more attacking options such as breaking up the centre and moves like Qb6. We'll see what he decides...
288,10,14,a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I again delay castling as from what I can see I am ready to do it when needed so why do it before then...maybe not such good advice for beginners but I think you have to trust your instincts on when you should castle rather than follow rules mechanically. The move is made to prevent Nb4 a pesky move driving the bishop to a remote square or trading a bishop for a knight.
289,10,15,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',This move from black carries more threat than my identical move as he has castled so can make a move like b5 if he wants I have no intention of doing so I had made the move defensively. It's interesting that the development from both sides is fairly symmetrical this tends to lead to draws unless one side unbalances the position.
290,10,16,dxc5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1nbpn2/2Pp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I grow tired of the symmetry so decide to shake things up. This move forces the bishop to move a 2nd time in the opening (which goes against principles) and moves the bishop to a square where he only attacks a pawn so his movement is restricted
291,10,17,Bxc5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Recapturng the pawn - notice that from this new position the only way he can move is back
292,10,18,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I finally decide to castle the position is starting to open up so it's time for the king to get to safety. It's still too early to think about good plans other than development and the symmetry gives few options at the minute however there's plenty of time...
293,10,19,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A good move moving the rook to a file that is likely to be opened in the future which is where he belongs.
294,10,20,1cxd5,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bP4/8/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A second capture in the centre. In a positional sense this makes no sense. The recapture with the pawn will give both the rook and bishop with wonderful open files to work with. However I will have the better placed bishop and have created an isolated pawn which I feel is a weakness in the long run.
295,10,21,1exd5,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p1n2n2/2bp4/8/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Simple recapture as previously explained this seems better for attacking options as it offers open files and diagonals to work on.
296,10,22,1Qc2,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p1n2n2/2bp4/8/P1NBPN2/1PQB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',A modest move but with a few attacking ideas. The bishop on c5 is undefended so I may be able to manufacture threats against that also the queen-bishop combo along the b1-h7 diagonal looks dangerous even if there is no threat immediately
297,10,23,1h6,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1n2n1p/2bp4/8/P1NBPN2/1PQB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"This move frees the knight as it was pinned to the h7 pawn (it couldn't move without losing the pawn) It also creates a ""luft"" for the king against any future back rank attacks. Perhaps weakens the kingside against a direct assault however it's not a serious threat."
298,10,24,1Rfe1,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1n2n1p/2bp4/8/P1NBPN2/1PQB1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Preparing a possible e4 in the future which could be dangerous combined with the threat to the c5 bishop.

300,10,26,1exd4,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1n2n1p/2b5/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PQB1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I prefered this to moving the knight as I feel he is well placed as he is and i dislike having my opponent dictate the exchanges
301,10,27,1Nxd4,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/2b5/3n4/P1NB1N2/1PQB1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black signals his intention for a mass exchange - retreating the queen via 15. Qd1 leads to 15...Rxe1 16. Bxe1 Nxf3 17. Qxf3 or something similar where my position looks to have worsened due to the exchanges
302,10,28,1Rxe8+,b'r1bqR1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/2b5/3n4/P1NB1N2/1PQB1PPP/R5K1 b - -',This is played as a prelude to the exchanges black must recapture as he is in check and with the queen on the file I can swing the rook across to e1 and control the file. Giving the possibliity of back rank threats with the bishop covering the h7 square.
303,10,29,1Qxe8,b'r1b1q1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/2b5/3n4/P1NB1N2/1PQB1PPP/R5K1 w - -',Recaptures the rook. This is better than wasting a move with the knight for no good reason as he sits at a good square atm.
304,10,30,1Nxd4,b'r1b1q1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/2b5/3N4/P1NB4/1PQB1PPP/R5K1 b - -',Rather than accept doubled pawns on the f-file or retreating the queen i take the iniative with an exchange of knights
305,10,31,1Bxd4,b'r1b1q1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/8/3b4/P1NB4/1PQB1PPP/R5K1 w - -',Recaptures and takes a strong position attacking the potencially weak f2 square.
306,10,32,1Re1,b'r1b1q1k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/8/3b4/P1NB4/1PQB1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Taking command of the e-file as I had intended this looks natural and strong. And if black is careless I can jump to the 8th or 7th rank and pressure his back line.
307,10,33,1Qc6,b'r1b3k1/1p3pp1/p1q2n1p/8/3b4/P1NB4/1PQB1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Moving the queen out of the range of the rook and looking at my fairly isolated king.

309,10,35,1Qb6,b'r1b3k1/1p3pp1/pq3n1p/8/3bN3/P2B4/1PQB1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',A good move countering my vague threat with 2 threats of his own. The pawns on f2 and b2 are both looking weak. Black threatens the straight forward Qxb2 and the more indirect Nxe4 follwed by Bxf2 
310,10,36,1Bc3,b'r1b3k1/1p3pp1/pq3n1p/8/3bN3/P1BB4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Defending the threats with one move this position looks very volatile with 4 pieces attacking and being attacked.
311,10,37,1Bxc3,b'r1b3k1/1p3pp1/pq3n1p/8/4N3/P1bB4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',The bishop cannot retreat to e5 obviously and after 19...Bc5 20. Nxf6 leads to problems and black is forced to double pawns on the f-file.
312,10,38,2Nxf6+,b'r1b3k1/1p3pp1/pq3N1p/8/8/P1bB4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',A nice inbetween move taking advantage of the threat Re8# to force black to double his pawns anyway as neither Bxf6 or Qxf6 cover the threat
313,10,39,2gxf6,b'r1b3k1/1p3p2/pq3p1p/8/8/P1bB4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',The forced recapture. At this point I have a target the doubled pawns are a major weakness with so few pieces on the board however I need to find a way of exploiting them.
314,10,40,2Qxc3,b'r1b3k1/1p3p2/pq3p1p/8/8/P1QB4/1P3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Recapturing the piece and equaling the position in terms of material. The immediate threat is Re8  which forces the king away then wins the underdefended bishop on c8. Also with my queen on c3 the black queen is pinned to defending the weak f6 pawn

317,10,43,2Rc8,b'2r3k1/1p1bRp2/pq3p1p/8/8/P1QB4/1P3PPP/6K1 w - -',A strong move this counters my threat with a more powerful one and looks to exploit my weak back rank (after the pawn moves my back rank is weaker than blacks)
318,10,44,2Qd2,b'2r3k1/1p1bRp2/pq3p1p/8/8/P2B4/1P1Q1PPP/6K1 b - -',Avoids the threat and sets up another counter threat now the bishop is attacked and the pawn on h6 is attacked black cannot defend both pieces in one move.

I this position my first thought was 24. Rxe7 Qxe7  25. Bh7  Kxh7 26. Qxe7 winning the queen however my weak back rank will be exploited by  26...Rc1 with checkmate in 1

322,10,48,2Rg3+,b'2rq2k1/1p1b1p2/p6p/5p2/8/P2B2R1/1P1Q1PPP/6K1 b - -',This move forces the king to move to the edge of the board where he is pinned in by the rook - the king must move to h7 to defend the attacked h6 pawn
323,10,49,2Kh7,b'2rq4/1p1b1p1k/p6p/5p2/8/P2B2R1/1P1Q1PPP/6K1 w - -',Defends the pawn but also gives his rook / queen a file to aim at my king in combo with his bishop if he moves the bishop onto the long diagonal (a8-h1).
324,10,50,2h3,b'2rq4/1p1b1p1k/p6p/5p2/8/P2B2RP/1P1Q1PP1/6K1 b - -',A slow move but nessessary to protect against any future attacks on my back rank. The move also gives the queen   bishop freedom to move into attack as they currently have to protect the back rank
325,10,51,2Be6,b'2rq4/1p3p1k/p3b2p/5p2/8/P2B2RP/1P1Q1PP1/6K1 w - -',Gives the queen freedom to move out off the back rank. Also makes vague threats like Bc4 against my pinned bishop which could be difficult if I am careless.
326,10,52,2b4,b'2rq4/1p3p1k/p3b2p/5p2/1P6/P2B2RP/3Q1PP1/6K1 b - b3',With no direct threat I can look to make my own threats - this move allows my queen to move to b2 with a checkmate threat at g7. It also means that my rook will be defending the backwards pawn after the bishop moves rather than the queen
327,10,53,2b5,b'2rq4/5p1k/p3b2p/1p3p2/1P6/P2B2RP/3Q1PP1/6K1 w - b6',Blocks the pawn on b4 from moving to b5 although this wasn't much of a threat I suspect black couln't find a move to improve the position so made a move and waited for me to come up with a threat for him to defend. And in fairness there is little that he can usefully do possibly something like Qf6 pre-empting my Qb2.
328,10,54,2Qb2,b'2rq4/5p1k/p3b2p/1p3p2/1P6/P2B2RP/1Q3PP1/6K1 b - -',Making the threat and forcing my opponent to defend

With the rooks gone from the board the chances of a direct checkmate are almost gone so we move into the endgame which given the position and material equality should be drawn.

What is best here? In a positional position (sorry for the pleonasm) closed one must think like Napoleon (study the field make a plan and Attack!). Tartakover said : Strategy is knowing what to do when there is nothing to do. Here is a fine example. Let's apply the three steps. 
Study the field: Week pawns on the queen side (I simplify other things can be considered). 
Plan : Try and put my pieces in that area they will be difficult to remove. 
Move : Knight or Bishop at b5. 
Tactical aspects will help me decide which is best.  Here I finally decide to first push the a pawn to further consolidate the piece I will put on b5 and also avoid deciding right now which piece I will put.
Why does this method work? It allows you to split your decision in three more managable steps. First a choice between 4 or 5 field characteristics; once one of these chosen to exploit you have a choice between 2 or 3 plans; and once your plan chosen that leaves you with 3 or 4 moves. Easier to deal with than the 25 or so possible moves here. Of course analyzing the field correctly and making the right plan are not always easy to do but with some practice anybody can improve his game."

Note du 8ème coup : Quel coup jouer dans une position de ce genre. Il y a en effet beaucoup de coups jouables. Dans une position 'positionnelle' (s'cusez le pléonasme) fermée comme celle-ci il est important d'appliquer la recette napoléonienne (examen du champ de bataille plan de campagne et ensuite     À l'attaque!). Tartakover a dit : la stratégie c'est savoir quoi faire quand il n'y a rien à faire. C'est la cas ici : pas de coup évident qui puisse donner un avantage immédiat. Il faut donc user de stratégie et une stratégie se bâtit en 3 étapes : examen de la position plan de bataille coup à jouer. Un exemple basé sur le coup que les blancs doivent jouer ici. 
Examen de la position (je simplifie un peu parce qu'il y aurait d'autres choses à examiner aussi) : cases blanches faibles du côté des noirs. 
Plan : placer mes pièces dans ce coin-là elles seront difficiles à déloger. 
Coup à jouer : le cavalier ou le fou en b5. 
Là il faut tout de même que j'essaie de voir lequel est le meilleur en calculant les conséquences et ça c'est l'aspect tactique du jeu qui est toujours là à côté de l'aspect stratégique. Ici je décide qu'il serait bon de pousser le pion  a pour donner une meilleure protection à la pièce que je compte installer en b5 et aussi je ne suis pas obligé de décider tout de suite si ce sera le cavalier ou le fou.
Est-ce efficace de procéder ainsi? En pratique on peut examiner 4 ou 5 caractéristiques d'une position ; une fois choisi laquelle on veut exploiter ceci peut nous amener vers 2 ou 3 plans différents rarement plus. Une fois un plan choisi l'exécution de ce plan laisse 2 ou 3 coups possibles à examiner. Ça me semble pas mal plus simple que de rester pris avec 25 possibilités comme ici si je n'ai pas de plan.
Je ne veux pas dire que c'est facile de trouver le bon plan (en fait c'est probablement ça le plus difficile à faire aux échecs) mais si on essaie avec la pratique on "

Advice no 2 : The great escape.
One of the obvious things you can check before making the move you have chosen is : If you have a piece that is more advanced in the enemy’s territory be sure that piece has an escape route and that it can not be trapped by the opponent’s pieces (or pawns). This is especially true if that piece is your queen.

Of course this advice can be reversed. You can check if you can trap an enemy piece.

Reason number one for this move : when you are ahead in material exchange pieces as Confucius would have said if chess had been invented in his epoch (or was it?). Here this general principle applies doubly as the white knight was dangerously placed. And as a bonus the white queen no longer threatens even if inderectly the weak h6 pawn.

Excellent plan. But here it falls short because the execution is faulty. It would have been better to first play the king to h1 then put the rook on the g file and then push the pawns. The problem with the present position is that the queen is alone to try and attack the king while the black pieces are all relatively well placed to replace the missing pawns in front of the king. But with the rook ready to come in it would have been a different story. Of course during all this preparation black would have had time to regroup. But at least this leaves a chance for error on the black side if he does not prepare well to meet white's plan.

But then this illustrates a common feature of open positions : if your pieces are soundly placed such moves will readily be available. What do I mean by pieces soundly placed? Let's check here : the two knights protect each other the queen protects the weak d6 pawn the bishop is protected by the pawn the rook is protected by the (weak but living) d6 pawn the other rook queen and king all offer mutual protection. Pieces are soundly placed when they control a lot of ground and they protect each other.

606,21,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I think 2...e6 is a more accurate move for Black here because it opens more lines for development than 2...d6 Black can castle faster and a d7-d5 advance is likely to occur.
607,21,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is why I don't think 2...d6 is a good move. It allows me to trade my bad bishop for either Black's good bishop or his important knight.
608,21,5,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think Nd7 is Black's best chance to get equality. Nc6 is worse than Bd7 because after Bxc6 Black has doubled pawns and a cramped position making it hard for him to develop his pieces to active squares.
609,21,6,O-O,b'rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Now I have a slight lead in development but Black has control of the dark squares so I need to make some sort of central breakthrough to get an advantage.
610,21,7,Re1,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I thought this move was sharper than Nc3.
611,21,8,g6,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',I thought Nc6 is a sharper move here. Even though it doesn't develop the kingside like g6 does g6 is a little more passive and can be played later.
612,21,9,e5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpp1p/3p1np1/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I exploit Black's passivity.
613,21,10,Nxe5,b'rn2kb1r/pp1qpp1p/5np1/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Now I have the initiative and must use it wisely.
614,21,11,Qc7,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pp1p/5np1/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Maybe Qd8 is better because it controls the open d-file and is much safer.
615,21,12,d4,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pp1p/5np1/2p1N3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq d3',I thought for awhile on this move because I plan on sacrificing a pawn for easier development and more central control.
616,21,13,1c3,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pp1p/5np1/4N3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',The gambit.
617,21,14,1Nxc3,b'rn2kb1r/ppq1pp1p/5np1/4N3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I have a lot of compensation for the pawn. My heavy pieces are strong on their open files I have a lot more control of the centre and I have a feeling Black's queen won't be comfortable for long.
618,21,15,1Bf4,b'rn2k2r/ppq1ppbp/5np1/4N3/5B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',In this gambit opening it's common for Black's queen to be harassed by tactical threats.
619,21,16,1Qb6,b'rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q3np1/4N3/5B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',It's hard for Black's queen to find a safe square.
620,21,17,1Nc4,b'rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q3np1/8/2N2B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',I thought about Na4 but I wanted that knight to go to b5.
621,21,18,1Qd8,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/5np1/8/2N2B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Black can afford to trade queens now because I'm no longer threatening Qxd8  Kxd8 Nxf7  winning an exchange.
622,21,19,1Nb5,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/5np1/1N6/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',"Trading queens only makes Black's game easier since he has an extra pawn. But now if Black tries to trade queens I have the ""in-between move"" Nc7  and can win Black's rook after I recapture the queen."
623,21,20,1Na6,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/n4np1/1N6/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',14...Nd5 ends in total disaster. Try to see why.
624,21,21,1Nbd6+,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/n2N1np1/8/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',I take away Black's right to castle while forking his pawn.
625,21,22,1Nxb7,b'r2q1k1r/pN2ppbp/n4np1/8/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Now if queens are traded I'll be much better because I won't be down a pawn and I'll still have the compensation giving up the pawn gave me on move 10.
626,21,23,1Nba5,b'r1q2k1r/p3ppbp/n4np1/N7/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Moving the other knight to a5 may have been better because then I'd have Rc1.
627,21,24,1h6,b'r1q2k1r/p3ppb1/n4npp/N7/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',There isn't much Black can do in this position without getting tactically destroyed so I guess he plans to castle by hand and hope he finishes development before my already active forces reach maximum attacking potential but he has overlooked my next move. If you can guess what it is give yourself a pat on the back.
628,21,25,1Rxe7,b'r1q2k1r/p3Rpb1/n4npp/N7/2N2B2/8/PP3PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Tactics like this are common in positions where the tactic victim is underdeveloped or has a weak king. Notice that this sacrifice cannot be accepted because of Kxe7 Qd6  Ke8 Re1  Qe6 Rxe6  fxe6 Qxe6  and Black will be mated after Kf8 Bd6# or Kd8 Nc6# so Black must accept the loss of a pawn.
629,21,26,1Nd6,b'r1q3kr/p3Rpb1/n2N1npp/N7/5B2/8/PP3PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',More tempo gains.
630,21,27,1Qc5,b'r5kr/p3Rpb1/n2N1npp/N1q5/5B2/8/PP3PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',My knight is under attack but I don't have to play passively because of it I can simply make a bigger tactical threat to counter the attack on my knight.
631,21,28,2Qb3,b'r5kr/p3Rpb1/n2N1npp/N1q5/5B2/1Q6/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Now it's mate in 2 if Black takes my knight.
632,21,29,2Rxf7,b'r6r/p4Rbk/n2N1npp/N1q5/5B2/1Q6/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',This is where Black signed his own death warrant. He thinks he can leave his f-pawn hanging because he's attacking my knight but I have more tactics.
633,21,30,2Qxa5,b'r6r/p4Rbk/n2N1npp/q7/5B2/1Q6/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',My next winning move probably isn't hard to see by White but can be easily overlooked by Black.
634,21,31,2Rxg7+,b'r6r/p5Rk/n2N1npp/q7/5B2/1Q6/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Black must be pissed now that he took my free knight.
635,21,32,2Kxg7,b'r6r/p5k1/n2N1npp/q7/5B2/1Q6/PP3PPP/R5K1 w - -',It's over now.
636,21,33,2Qf7#,b'r6r/p4Qk1/n2N1npp/q7/5B2/8/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Black is blocked in by his own undeveloped rook.
637,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am annotating this game for a member of my team so I will only mention black moves which I feel are significant
638,22,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',A variation on the main line Ng3 a useful variation to aviod the main Sicilian line which is the most played opening on Gameknot as well as tournament level play and can get repetitive.
639,22,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',A move which can cause black problems despite white being unable to play Nc3 to attack the queen
640,22,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Better would be exd5 to open the centre as black's queen would still be developed too early
641,22,4,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2p1pp/5p2/2ppP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White's centre is vulnerable black would be better of playing Nc6 to attack the pawn continue development and slow white down by forcing him to defend it
642,22,5,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2p1pp/5p2/2ppP3/5P2/2P5/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',d4 is a better alternative
643,22,6,Qa5,b'r1b1kbnr/pp2p1pp/2n2p2/q1ppP3/5P2/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black decides to develop his queen too early anyway. You should refrain from developing the queen until you have pieces to back it up
644,22,7,d3,b'r1b1kbnr/pp2p1pp/2n2p2/q1ppP3/5P2/2PP1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Again d4 would be better this move is too passive allowing black the chance to achieve equality
645,22,8,Be2,b'r3kbnr/pp2p1pp/2n2p2/q1ppP3/5Pb1/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This pin risks whie losing his e5 pawn if he had originally played d4 this would not be an issue
646,22,9,exf5,b'r3kbnr/pp4pp/2n5/q1pppp2/8/2PP1B2/PP1B2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black willingly weakens his own pawn formation better would have been to give up the pawn to weaken white's initiative
647,22,10,1Bxd5,b'r3kbnr/pp4pp/2n5/q1pBpp2/8/2PP4/PP1B2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White is down a pawn without significant advantages for his sacrifice
648,22,11,1c4,b'r3kb1r/pp4pp/2n2n2/1qpBpp2/2P5/3P4/PPQB2PP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Better would be Na3 Qa6 Bc4 still controlling d4 without weakening white's pawn structure.
649,22,12,1Bg5,b'2kr1b1r/pp4pp/1qn2n2/2pBppB1/2P5/2NP4/PPQ3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',This simply forces black to develop a piece he would have anyway better would be 0-0
650,22,13,2Qxe7,b'2kr3r/pp2Q2p/1q4p1/2p2p2/1nP5/2NP4/PP4PP/R4RK1 b - -',White's queen is well placed however without backup it will simply be chased back
651,22,14,2Nxd3,b'2kr3r/pp2Q2p/1q4p1/2p2p2/2P5/2Nn4/PP4PP/R4RK1 w - -',White is still losing due to being a pawn down
652,22,15,2Rd5,b'1k1r3r/pp2q2p/6p1/2pRnp2/2P2N2/8/PP2Q1PP/5RK1 b - -',Better would be Nd3 threatening a queen trade-off to weaken black's attack as well as winning the c pawn
653,22,16,2Ne6,b'1k1r3r/pp2q2p/2n1N1p1/2pR1p2/2P5/8/PP2Q1PP/5RK1 b - -',A needless attack causing white to fall even further behind. A trade-off of queens would help white equalize after Qxe7 Nxe7 Rxc5 and white has managed to win back his pawn with equality
654,22,17,2Qe3,b'1k1nr3/pp2q2p/4N1p1/2p2p2/2P5/4Q3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Again white had the chance to trade-off the queens and win the pawn via Qe5  Kc8 Qxc5 Qxc5 Nxc5 and white should be able to draw without trouble
655,22,18,3Rd1+,b'4r3/pp1kq2p/4n1p1/2p2p2/2P5/4Q3/PP3KPP/3R4 b - -',White will simply be forced to move it back with a loss of tempo
656,22,19,3Rd1+,b'4r3/pp1kq2p/6p1/2p2p2/2P5/4Q3/PPn2KPP/3R4 b - -',One last chance to equalize white could have played Qd2  winning black's Queen for a Rook he would still be down a pawn but would have a better chance at fighting back.
657,22,20,Qe2,b'4r3/pp5p/2k3p1/2p2p2/2Pn4/3Q4/PP2q1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black quickly begins to snap up white's pawns at this point white has lost
658,22,21,Nf3+,b'8/pp5p/2k3p1/2p2p2/4q3/5n1P/4r1PK/R4Q2 w - -',White played fairly well here with a few mistakes his biggest was the loss of his e5 pawn would lead to an advantage for black throughout the game.
659,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am White in this game I played at my chess club. It shows how only a couple of free developing moves can be worth more than just a measly pawn.
660,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian Defense. Just about the only opening played at my club.
661,23,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black commits to a plan too early in the game. I haven't shown exactly what my plans are so Black shouldn't either.
662,23,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Gaining more central space and opening lines to develop my queenside.
663,23,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Instead of immediately recapturing like in the main line I decide to develop another force and may play c3 sometime later in the game to sacrifice the pawn for development which would transpose into a variation of the Morra Gambit where Black has played g6 and playing g6 isn't good in the Morra Gambit which is why Black shouldn't have committed to fianchettoing his bishop this early in the game because he has no idea what my opening plans are.
664,23,5,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/6p1/4p3/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq e6',Black should've been developing but instead he wastes a couple tempi holding onto his pawn. And I can't play Nxe5 because of Qa5 .
665,23,6,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/6p1/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Initiating the pawn sacrifice.

Also Black has holes on d6 and d5 and if he fianchettoes his bishop it will be inactive. I should have enough compensation for the pawn.
667,23,8,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/6p1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Nc6 is another move but Black probably wanted to develop his kingside as fast as possible because he is seriously lacking in development.
668,23,9,Qd5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/6p1/3Qp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Only the 7th move and I'm already attacking Black's underdeveloped position.

677,23,18,1O-O,b'r1b1k2b/pp1pn2p/n5pB/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now I have finished developing. All I need to do is keep improving my position because I have a winning material advantage and Black's position can't do anything.
678,23,19,1b6,b'r1b1k2b/p2pn2p/np4pB/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',All Black can do is try simple developing moves.
679,23,20,Bb7,b'r3k2b/pb1pn2p/np4pB/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This move loses at least a piece. It's common for the side with the underdeveloped passive position to make tactical blunders like this.
680,23,21,1Nf7,b'r3k2b/pb1pnN1p/np4pB/4p3/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black may as well resign now. I'm threatening Nxh8 and Nd6 .

705,26,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p1B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White should have taken the pawn instead. This move isn't bad but simplifies things too much.
706,26,3,Qe3,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/6B1/2P5/2N1Q3/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',This move hampers White's development. Qd3 would have been wiser and White could answer Nb4 with Qd2.

708,26,5,1g3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pn1N1/8/4Q1P1/PP2PP1P/R3KB1R b KQ -',White intends to develop his bishop to g2 but the bishop will be blocked in by the pawn on d5.
709,26,6,Qe5,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/3p3p/3Pq3/8/5QP1/P3PPBP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black still needs to keep an eye on his weak queenside pawns.
710,26,7,c6,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2pp3p/3Pq3/4P3/5QP1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black moves the pawn before White can threaten it with Rec1.
711,26,8,c5,b'r1b1r1k1/p4pp1/3p3p/2p1q3/4P3/5QP1/P4PBP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Black has a backwards d-pawn but it can be easily defended and after all it is an extra pawn.
712,26,9,2Rd5,b'r1b1r1k1/5pp1/3p3p/p1pRq3/4P3/5QP1/P4PBP/4R1K1 b - -',White blunders. His back rank is completely undefended.
713,26,10,Rxe1+,b'r1b3k1/5pp1/3p3p/p1pP4/8/5QP1/P4PBP/4r1K1 w - -',Black already has enough material for the queen in the form of two rooks but he's not done; he can win back the queen.
714,26,11,Bh3,b'r5k1/5pp1/3p3p/p1pP4/8/5QPb/P4P1P/4rBK1 w - -',White could have resigned here.
715,26,12,Re8,b'4r1k1/5pp1/3p3p/p1pP4/8/6P1/P4P1P/5K2 w - -',Now that the king can't cross the e-file all Black has to do is push his c pawn.

717,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I was White in this game where I pawnstormed my opponent.
718,27,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is the most logical response but symmetry is usually favorable to the side with the tempo. The Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is the best way to try for an advantage as Black.
719,27,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The most logical move. I develop a kingside piece while attacking a pawn in the centre.
720,27,3,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. I develop my bishop to the most active square.
721,27,4,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Supposedly this is advantageous to White but this move avoids the well analyzed main lines of the Ruy Lopez. Instead Black accepts doubled pawns and a kingside pawn minority in order to leave my bishop on an unimportant diagonal and Black will usually have more experience in this opening than a normal Ruy-Lopez Player.
722,27,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now there are a lot of imbalances in the position. I am ahead in development and have a kingside pawn majority but Black may be able to gain tempo chasing my bishop. There are a few common plan choices here. One is to ignore my bishop and play O-O and c3 taking advantage of Black's weak pawn by trying to trade it for a flank pawn strengthening my pawn centre. A more passive but safer plan is to play c4 and Qe2 which greatly increases my control of the light squares and makes Black's development more difficult. The plan I chose was the only one I thought would bring me an advantage.
723,27,6,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pPP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq f3',My plan was to take advantage of my kingside pawn majority and storm Black's kingside before he has a chance to finish developing. Although my plan probably could've been more promising if I'd played c4 first keeping my bishop on the a4-e8 diagonal.
724,27,7,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb5/3pPP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It's hard for Black to find active moves in this position. I thought Nf6 was his best try.
725,27,8,Qf3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Since my knight no longer needs f3 it is free for my queen.
726,27,9,a6,b'r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/1Bb5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Black questions my oddly placed bishop.

741,27,24,1Rf4,b'r4rk1/3q1ppn/2ppb3/ppb3PP/3pPR2/3P4/PPP1B1Q1/RNB3K1 b - -',I should've played this earlier because I need my rook on the h-file to complete my attack.
742,27,25,1Bb6,b'r4rk1/3q1ppn/1bppb3/pp4PP/3pPR2/3P4/PPP1B1Q1/RNB3K1 w - -',Clearly Black has no idea what to do and is making random moves. Either he underestimates my strong attack or he can't find suitable defensive moves and is waiting to lose.
743,27,26,c5,b'r4rk1/3q1ppn/1b1pb3/ppp3PP/3pP2R/3P4/PPP1B1Q1/RNB3K1 w - -',Another passive move is all it takes to lose. Now Black probably can't recover.

If he leaves his rook hanging I will still have a lot of tactical threats and Black doesn't have any possibilities for a counterattack since my king is perfectly safe despite having no pawn cover. Although my king may become weak if Black survives my attack.

796,29,5,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pppp2/8/3PPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This deprives the b-knight the c6 square which is its most natural post.  The move does have the virtue of opening the a5-d8 diagonal for the queen.
797,29,6,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',On c4 the bishop would run into d6-d5 and have to move again.  On d3 it is poised to attack the weakened light squares in black's kingside.  A move such as f7-f6 is a serious weakening.
798,29,7,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p5pp/1ppppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now it is almost comical.  The move allows the bishop to be developed but it bottles up the queen again.  Is black hoping to get all of his pawns on the 6th?  I've seen this curious play before where players forget about their pieces and move only pawns.  It isn't to be recommended.
799,29,8,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/p5pp/1ppppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Now white has safely removed the king from the center and will try to open lines of attack and penetrate black's position.

This means that white will be able to make threats that black will eventually be unable to respond to.  The important thing is to trust in the space advantage and not do anything rash.  You don't have to hurry in positions like this.

This is a big advantage for white.  Notice also that only the black h-pawn is on a white square.  White's pieces are free to settle on white squares in black's terrotory without having to worry about pawns driving them away.

837,30,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Ok one thing i know is that this opening move 1.. c5 is supposed to unbalance the game which is true. White now has stake of control over the d5 square (white square) and black now has stake on the d4 square (black). However white's pawn on e4 pretty much seals that square but places it under future threat for which white has to defend. I like to take the outside control approach.

But here's probably one of the many mistakes i made: but trading the knights i've opened up his fianchetto. Plus it will eventually open up the e file for his rook. I had to ensure that the file is protected.
843,30,7,1Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N3P1/PPPB1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',(??) I know that white's intending to bring the other castle into play but i thought Bg5 was a bit better cos it will then stop black from playing the e7 pawn as it would create a pin on the Nf6
844,30,8,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pbnp1/3Np3/4P3/4Q1P1/PPPB1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Here's an interesting scenario: i didn't realise it before but now i've got a nice little c file to occupy. at the same token i'm weary about the knight jumping on e7 and causing havoc. So here's how i played the hand i was dealt...
845,30,9,1Ba5,b'3q1rk1/Qp3pbp/3pbnp1/B2Np3/4P3/6P1/PPr2PBP/R4RK1 b - -',b7 pawn is under threat. So i've got to protect it with my queen and test out how much he cares about his queen. As the game continues I will demonstrate how much importance was placed on the white queen and how that was white's ultimate demise.
846,30,10,1Qb6,b'q4rk1/1p3pbp/1Q1pbnp1/B2Np3/4P3/6P1/PPr2PBP/R4RK1 b - -',When i saw this i knew that he really cares about his queen. Now i'm going to try and work to move the queen around as much as i can thus resulting in white's loss of tempo. Never leave the work of the game rest on the shoulders of only one piece.
847,30,11,1Qb4,b'q4rk1/1p3pbp/3p2p1/B2Ppb2/1Q6/6P1/PPr2PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Another mistake from Black: at this point i can move e5-e4. This will block the Bg2 bishop and releases the diagonal my bishop on g7 rests. If there was an exchange in the two white square bishops i will still win the bishop on a5 as its no longer protected by the queen. Oh well what follows is just as good i suppose...
848,30,12,e4,b'q1r3k1/1p3pbp/3p2p1/3P1b2/1Q2p3/4B1P1/PPr2PBP/2R2RK1 w - -',Ah all i need is for white to take the pawn on e4...

During this time i developed my pieces enough to create a mating opportunity. This loss of tempo is really damaging at this point in the game because you need to develop the right opportunity to end the game.
851,30,15,2Bxe4,b'q1r3k1/1p3pbp/3Q2p1/3P4/4b3/4B1P1/Pr3P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',And now i saw a potential mating opportunity since my queen occupies a strong diagonal. However the pawns on b7 and d4 are blocking it and my bishop on e4 needs to protect the g2 square. Its a long shot but in the process of setting it up it will open up other doors.
852,30,16,Be6,b'q1r3k1/1p1Q1pbp/4b1p1/8/8/4B1P1/Pr3P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',Perfect. Protecting my rook on c8 threatening the queen and getting the bishop on e6 ready to move to Bh3.

So Analyzing the board

25. Rf8-Bh6 now there is threat for f7 & f8 mate

         If black moves 26. Rf5 to protect f7 & f8 squares
         Then  i have other tricks in my sleeve for example Qh8
