2,0,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with his pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...e5 or ...c5. Until the mid-1930s, it was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Isaac Boleslavsky, and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Tal, with prominent grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi, Miguel Najdorf, Efim Geller, John Nunn, Svetozar Gligorić, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the KID in 2012, and current top players Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov and Ding Liren all play the opening."
3,0,3,f3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"This is Sämisch variation, a subtle blockading system and a critical challenge to the King's Indian.[1] It is named after the German Grandmaster Friedrich Sämisch. The Sämisch has been played by numerous grandmasters, including world champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.

Bobby Fischer had trouble against the Sämisch. Mednis' How to Beat Bobby Fischer showed that five of Fischer's losses were against the Sämisch King's Indian, and remarked that Fischer eventually avoided the King's Indian if he believed he would face the Sämisch.[2] Fischer faced the Sämisch five times against Boris Spassky in their 1992 rematch, however—winning two, drawing two and losing one.

In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), the Sämisch Variation is covered in chapters E80 to E89

He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the ""Old School"" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an ""elder statesman"" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration..."

I said that better was just to move the pawn one square which prevents mate.  She said, ""I didn't know what to do.""  I then said that this protects the piece but advancing it just one square did that as my N is threatened.  Getting confused of where we were set up, I was implying, if you look at it from the right square like this diagram, as opposed to, the game that best would've been 4...d6.  It was then that I asked myself what I did.  Looking at it the right way, this does the same thing.  But, luckily this was such a short game and I know the defense that I will go back when it's her and me and edit that comment.  As best was 4...f6  That's the move that would've prevented mate and protected the N.  I was then looking at what comes after like 5.Qh5+, but don't like the looks of 5...g6 since there's an intereference with my N.  In other words, it prevents my Q from forking on e5 which is what you see in the Domino's Defense.  But, after this game, we played another one, and I coached you.  Unfortunately, the circumstances were the same with the board being on the wrong.  Moreover, is that it was longer, so I felt that it could not be annotated.  But, she played the Domiano's Defense and accepted the piece sac on e5 which got her in trouble.  Then, Mariann, overlooked the pinning motif with her Q against the K which enabled me to win.  She then overlooked something that lost the other R.  Being that we were out of time combined with ruinous loss of material, she resigned.  So, I combined this game with the second game to tell what's important to learn from this game.  And, it was exactly what GM Susan Polgar emphasized at Polgar University 2017.  I told her that it is important to be aware of all threats by asking yourself what your opponent wants to do.  For example, does he or she want to mate or win material.  If any of that is a yes, you need to respond to the threat.  That is an important step to becoming a better chess player. "

This is because I did some studies with GM's Judit and Susan Polgar.  They involved back ranks that were weak in a similar way.  And, the HW question involved giving up the Q with the idea that if the opponent takes, it's mate, similar to this.  In the aftermath, I looked at reversion's game against dipole_moment.  There was a very similar threat but not including a Q sac.  Instead, reversion played 26...Qxe5, but had he recaptured with the R (26...Rxe5), dipole_moment would've had a mate in 4, involving the back rank, as well.  So, I thought that it would work here being that if he takes here, it's mate in 3.  However, I knew that Charles would see this threat.  However, I thought it would be very difficult for him drive it off without losing his Q, but I was wrong.  As it turns out, I overlooked the intermediate checks that are about to follow.  Instead, much better would've still been threatening mate and trying for a stalemate with 25...Rxe3.  Surely, Charles wouldn't have allowed it, but it would've been difficult for white to be able to avoid the draw.  In other words, it would've been difficult for him to win.

So, I analyzed a second variation which would result in a draw by repetition.

Before that, when I wasn't sure, if it were N for B, I'd exchange just because it was possible.  So, it was still being too readisome to do it.  Then, came a lesson with GM Susan Polgar at Polgar University 2017.  In a very small segment she talked about exchanging and said that even N for B doesn't mean you should exchange.  Instead, you should only engage in an even exchange when there is an immediate advantage.  Then came the dream, and that's when the lord said that I still need to change my thought process and not think that exchanging gets rid of my problems.  On top of what Ken said, that's also where I realize that Jack was wrong by advising me to exchange whenever possible against stronger players.  As Susan implied that being up against stronger opposition is even more of a reason to not just go into exchanges.  But, here, I asked myself what choice do I have.  For example, after 6...Bh5, which I considered 7.g4 Bg6.  Forgetting that the other N was exchanged, I had Ghost Vision and thought 8.Nf4.  Once again, I jumped the guns but there since in that situation, an exchange is forced, sooner or later.  My other thinking was that I didn't want to be forced to retreat to e6 where the center is blocked or move to d7 where it has less mobility.  And, I didn't want to undevelop my B to c8.  So, I thought that the best option was this move to prevent the worries.  Well, my assessment and thought process was wrong due to the Ghost Vision.  Had I remembered that one of his N's was exchanged and where it would go, my assessment would've been correct.  So, much better was 6...Bh5, as 7.g4?! and not only do I retreat to g6, but his K would, at the very least be weakened which favors black."

And, I keep using those pawns chains one by one where each advances one square until I've promoted.  But, I forgot that after 33.Bf1, I'm now forced to retreat.  In fact, he could even stop those variations with 31.Bf1.  After which, even after moving my R and playing something like a later ...b6, he has Ra2.  The only thing that would help is ...Rd5+, but Ted can block with something like Rd2.  And, in some of these variations he would have an advantage.  Ted and I just didn't realize due to the distractions.  But, Jack then said that after 27...Bh7, white was hopeless.  It's true, and I don't even mind him watching or commenting after the game to coach us.  But, what I didn't enjoy was him getting involved and changing things around before the end of game.  I guess it is good practice.  And, what I've got to learn and get better is knowing how to overcome these distractions.

Of course, what I cannot understand is why you suggested 
b3 to begin with. 
In doing that you went off the stonewall opening, and offered 
that free pawn on d4. 

Also, you did not give enough time for others to offer suggestions, 
and thus allow for us to change our vote, if we were confused with 
the move b3. 

I thought you had some devious plan by suggesting that move, 
but now I see that there was no logical thought behind it. 

If we are to win this game, please give others and myself plenty 
of time to reconsider, in case of a typo, or some other reason.  ynwa77: I apologise. It was my fault. In future please notice, that I'll only make my suggest and if I have plan I will share it with you. 
I want to be positive. We will not be down in material and if we have to change wN to bB, our position is not too bad. Of course it would be nice to have castle, but we can manage without it. 

My intention is never hurry other players. You can take all the time you want. We need to just learn how we each other think and things will get smoother. 

I want to think I made my blunder now and I make better moves later. 

And if you two think it is better to sacrifice R and keep castle still available, it's fine to me.  And I know this is just trying to explain things better, but we will have f,g and h pawns free to move them forward and that way we can make position unorthodox and unfamiliar for jkarp. 
But that is something we need to talk later  ynwa77: And of course there is still c3 available if we want to go pawn down but keep queen side castle open.  knightrider62: Rb1 is the only move.  penguin_: Late entry I agree with Rb1  ynwa77: I will move Rb1 "

Shall we have open discussion of this game or do we just talk about next move and why it is done? 
I think it would benefit us all if we can toss ideas and possible future moves and positions even if opponent can see it.  penguin_: I agree the major objective in these type of games is to learn winning is secondary.  knightrider62: Nd-f3 bringing the knight to a better square and attacking the bishop twice.  easy-win: Nd-f3 is not recommended by instructors
The point being is that if you move the same piece twice in the opening 
you lose tempo since you could move another piece for advantage, 
in this case, the knight on g 1 has not been moved and will serve the 
same purpose as moving that d knight. 
Also, it makes more room for castling on the king side, if that is what we 
need to do later. 
In the opening, it is always good to place your pieces in such a way that 
they will have more control like future attacks, and to defend if possible. 

Also we should place the number in front of the suggested move, so we 
can keep track of the number of moves we have made, and when to make 
the next move. 

In this case, it is premature to suggest a move before the opponent moves 
so that we can know what would be the best move after that move is made.
 ?! On a separate note: This was played to develop my N and prepare to castle.  But, better was 5...Bc3 to pin the N right away.  Once pinned, it would be difficult for them to break it.  I can only hope that white does not move their Nd2.  If they do, this opportunity is gone.  "

In making this move, we are controlling the way the 
opponent moves, by attacking. 
The opponent will either move the DS bishop, or might 
want to protect the it with a pawn or a knight. 

It is always good to try to figure out what we think 
the opponent will react to what we do. 
If we can accurately figure that out, we have an 
advantage. But in order to do this, we have to 
consider the response/s as close as possible, 
which is not simple, especially when the opponent 
has a much higher rating than we have.  knightrider62: Ok I agree as it has the same purpose as my suggested move nf3 it is.  ynwa77: Do we have plan if black moves next Bc5 or Bb6? Because if we miss next move it is going to be Ng4.  I think we should also consider h3. If we have to exchange N to B, we have strong B. 
Just thinking possibilities.  easy-win: The question is if Bc5 or Bb6
We need to keep developing, but let us wait what our opponent does first. 

On that move of h3, again we have to wait for a move, to counter the move. 

The blunder b3 has put us at a disadvantage which will be like waiting for a wound to heal  ynwa77: So is right way to play Ng-f3 and then, if black makes Bc5 or Bb6, h3?  easy-win: I think for now that is the best we can do, but let's see if anyone else 
can make a better suggestion. 

On h3 the knight can capture that pawn. 

B-b5 or c5 and we should fianchetto out BSB. 

Still we should wait for others.

It was mainly work related, but there were other things to. What's important to note is that this is why the game took a pause.  When I said as bad, I meant as bad as I thought.  What happened is that a Blizzard Warning was issued for my area.  And, the forecast called for 18-24 inches of snow with 50+ mph winds.  Power outage was a potential.  However, the wind wasn't as bad, and sleet mixed in.  Thus, all in all, I got about a foot of snow, and no power was loss.  Yet, a lot was going on, and postponing, by my books, was the right call.  On a separate note: The idea behind this move is that I am now threatening to win another pawn."

Ne4 does not present a serious problem that I am able to discern. 
Among other moves which can be made next is the possible Bb5+. 
I have found that extensive analysis into the possibilities that exist, 
are only as effective as the analyzer. 
For this reason, we have several opinions from which to decide 
on each move. At the present position, if anyone can identify a 
danger on the suggested move, I ask that it can be discussed 
before we decide to proceed. 

ynwa77, could you expound on the detrimental positional disadvantage 
that you find in the suggested move, e3?  ynwa77: Stealth, I trust your analysis
I am concerned the fact that black is connecting his pieces and is locking our pieces. I also don't like the idea that black is dictating tempo and therefore would like to try Ne5, then exchange bishops and attack to Q with both Ns. 
I don't have clear plan, so I don't want to ruin everybodys game because my gutfeeling. 

Here is way better players than me so I'm with e3.  easy-win: Not at all
I always welcome other options, and am always open to receive 
other views which may be refreshing, such as yours. 

Do not ever hold back on your opinions, maybe no one else might be 
able to see something you can see. 

In your suggestion of Ne5, neither one of our N's can move there, 
(to e5), and at this time, our pawn at f4 is in danger of being taken by 
the queen on the next move which will also enable it to move to 
g3, checkmate! 

However, you are correct in that black has the advantage. 

With e3 we may be able to free our WSB thus opening the back 
rank for king side castle. 

At present, our N's are connected, giving our king more security.  ynwa77: Why can't we move N from f3 to e5?  I withdraw my previous question As I see now that we will lose N that way."

It develops our WSB and clears the f1 and g1. 

Knightrider62, It would be preferable if you could submit your vote with you explanation. 
Because this way we can accumulate the votes necessary for our next move.  ynwa77: Vote Bd3
It opens chance to castle. 
I like to think situation positionally, and that Bc3 is disturbing me way too much. It is something I need to work with inside my own head, but right now I'm just scared that B is getting as big trouble. As I said, it's just a feeling.  easy-win:  ynwa77
It is not good to worry. 
When we see a position where the opponent has placed a piece 
or pawn in a threatening square, what we should do is to check how 
many of our own pieces are defending, and if our defense is 
adequate, the next step is to see if it is possible for the opponent 
to bring additional pressure to the piece, and if so, is there a way 
to increase the defense, or parry with an attack of our own.. 
In the present diagram, our d2 knight is defended 4 times, 
the threat consists only of a knight, or knight bishop exchange 
because we have four defenders to the knight. 
The move that might force the bishop away could be B-b2 
if the bishop moves to the edge a file, then the rook falls. 

But for now, I believe Bd3 is a safe enough move that 
favors our development. 

But I am always open to suggestions and/or discussion. 

The bottom line is, not to worry, but to study the position 
and decide the best course to follow.  penguin_: Vote Bd3
Bd3 is the best we have at the moment. Then we may be able to castle and start to bring some pressure on black. White got into trouble early but we can recover."

I think we should decide do we want to play this game orthodox or unorthodox way. 
Considering the situation and nature of this game, it might be good idea to try something we don't do in normal games. 
I still want to win this game and play as good as I can, but maybe we can expand our game a bit. 
For example in current position I normally wouldn't consider moving Kf2 but that's only because it looks risky. But is there some benefits in that move if we can use K active piece instead thinking it as something that must be just protected? 
Any thoughts anyone?   knightrider62: There are always exceptions to the rules. So it is the demands of the situation that we should meet. Not Wether it is orthodox or not. Trading a rook for a knight is not a. Good idea so cannot be considered as a worthy counter attack.  On a separate note: although white's opportunity to castle is gone, black's is not.  So, I took advantage of that opportunity while it was still there.

The idea here, is to keep the queen from coming to 
h4 with a check. 
As it is now, moving our knight to g3 would entice black 
to exchange knights, when we would then put our king 
at a more vulnerable square, where it could be attacked 
by a king side pawn storm, backed by the queen and the 
white bishop at c8. 
Also that pawn on e3 is providing necessary protection 
to our center pawn at f4, 
If the black e pawn jumps two squares to e5, we can not 
move it, because it is pinned at this time by the queen, 
but with a knight on f3 we can capture that pawn if it 
moves there if he were to move it.

after the move Rg2, as you note, we will take the pawn on h5 with the knight 
on g3, discovering a check on the black king, after the king is forced to move 
out of check, we can take the queen, and black will probably resign.  ynwa77: Vore 21. Rg2

You will notice that the queen cannot recapture the knight because of the rook 
pinning the queen to the king. Also that no other piece can be placed 
between the rook and the queen to break the pin. 
When/if the queen captures our rook, the king will capture the queen.  ynwa77: Vote 22. Nxh5
I agree with easy-win.  redfoxrising: SAME I vote for the same Nxh5 as it is protected due to the pin it is on the rim but in this case that is the best outpost for our N.  falcon67: I vote for Nxh5 as well.  knightider62: My vote Nxh5 Nxh5 is my vote also.  jkarp: I resign with the following note. I played quite well in the very beginning. But, I made some terrible oversights. One was a pawn being on the same line as the N and Queen which allowed the winning back of material. And, just as important is what I just overlooked given that my Queen is on the same line as the K and your R. That was probably Ghost Vision as I thought that the Queen was on a different line. But, you guys played very well after these terrible moves. GG.

Although problematic still with exchanges, it got better.  That was mainly when I asked Susan Polgar when it's appropriate to exchange.  But, what Jack outlined is wrong.  That's because deeper_insight (TA) mentioned that, in this position, it's better not to exchange.  Instead, after ...a6, the best response is Ba4, and after ...b5, Bb3 is played.

But, that won't do, as he'd get my Queen, instead.  So, this is where I came to the realization that white's position is hopeless.  And, there's nothing else to get from continuing to play on.  When the game was over, Jack and I reviewed it.  He was almost enfuriated with my play here.  I can understand why, Mr. Stockel said that this was the one of the worst openings that he's ever seen from me.  So, we went to the beginning.  We even started a new game.  Unfortunately, he didn't go over it correctly since he said that it started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6  But, he played the Berlin Defense with 3...Nf6 followed by that moved.  And, he said that my losing blunder occurred right after he played ...Nd4.  Better was to just accept the exchange and get the DSB into play.  He was right there, as I miscalculated a variation and played a move that was easily countered, when I thought that I had pressure.  But, what my mentor said next, including the moral to this story is completely incorrect.  According to Jack, although not the losing blunder, I started going wrong by retreating with Ba4, instead of exchanging with Bxc6.   So, when we started a new game he made me play Bxc6 after ...a6.  Getting wrong on how this game went, we started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6.  But, we did not finish or get far with the game since Tom Levine came to play Jack.  With that comes his moral which is why I, for a long while, was in a bad habit of exchanging recklessly before the lesson with Ken.  As he said that the lesson to be learned is that when you're up against stronger opposition the idea is to exchange early and often.  By that, he means as much as possible, or doing so just because I can.  His logic is that stronger players want their pieces, so if you allow it, they become dangerous.  His moral, however, is wrong because of what Ken mentioned.  As the idea is that, in general, you might need those pieces later on.  So, just exchanging material without any thought is wrong on all levels.  And, as I know, Ken's correct.  With that being said, although I've reached the next level of seeing the board, what I must remember is to calculate the variations accurately.  That's what's needed to advance even further of good chess play.  What I forgot which Ken emphasized is that stronger players look at multiple variations, as opposed to, just one variation.  What I'm guilty of is only looking at one or two variations and thinking that they work which leads to oversights.  For example, I studied only one long set of variation when playing the blunderous 9.Bd5?? followed by 11.Bxg5?? which lost more material.  Although it didn't lose anything else, even 10.Qh5 was wrong because of how "

When he said that, Jack might of thought that he was taking me off guard since it appears like something different.  I say that because even though this mentor taught me the defense, he hasn't played it in a while.  So, my guess is that by saying it, Jack's reminding me of how intense openings can be.  However, I am very used to it, as that is the main defense that I play.  So, for now, everything is not only standard, but it's what I'm most used to."

The idea being to, as we know, prevent 6.Nb5 or 6.Bb5+.  But, this move is just as effective, and this, in reality, where I'm reminded of how intense openings can be.  It used to be, even after my second training game with Ken, that I went wrong by not knowing what to do when someone played something against me that I'm not used to.  That was, especially in the opening when entering unfamiliar territory.  Yes, the second training game with Ken was very helpful as he is also a good coach.  However, unlike what you'd think, it did not solve the problem.  Overtime, I learned, even though it might not be the right attitude to just expect the unexpected.  I learned that if I'm prepared for anything expect to be surprised, unfamiliar openings or moves will not take me off guard.  Therefore, I'd know how to handle.  For example, the Spanish opening starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.  However, we can see a similar setup in the Sicilian.  For example, Jack and other's have also played 5...Nc6.  This used to take me off guard and, back in the day, caused me to go wrong.  However, I calmly play 6.Bb5 as that gets me back into familiar territory.  When, it does not work in that position, I find something similar to make it work.  But, the idea is to just stay calm and collected and pretend that it's yoga.  That is how I adjust to something I'm not used to.  It's the analogy that I have created to compare yoga to chess when getting into something that intense.  The journey is to yoga as the position is to chess.  Just like with yoga that takes you on the journey, in chess, every position is different.  Some intense.  But, we don't fight or run away from it (which is what the Fight or Flight Syndrome is.)  Instead, we accept it for what it is and learn to adjust."

And, when you're in standing facing dog and lunge, you don't struggle to get the foot on the mat.  Instead, if it doesn't make it on it's own, you help it to get there with your hand.  Well, the same thing here.  I wanted to do a lot with the N.  But, I couldn't find any squares.  The only thing I thought might be logical was 6.Nf5 but am not ready to exchange.  Therefore, I just returned the N to where it originally was.  And, it's worth noting that the loss of tempo here is of no concern to me."

In part, I didn't know what else to do.  And, in general, when I'm not sure, the way to not be taken off guard is going by what my instincts tell me without giving it a lot of consideration.  The reason is because thinking about me too much has also generated the Fight or Flight mechanism, in the past, which is also where I'd go wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that it took me a long while to surpass beginner status, let alone, where I am today.    That's why I give the absolute threshold (just enough) consideration to ask myself the chances that it will work.  But, if it is possible, I do it.  More often then not, it's exchanging, as I feel more comfortable doing so.  As for me, it is about getting rid of my opponents pieces, especially when they look strong.

Before this move, my original play was, once again 16.Nd5 with the same idea.  This time, it was being that one of my pieces wasn't en-prise.   This is where, like with Ken, Mr. Stockel gets into my thought process and coaches me.  Jack: Why did I play 14...Rc8  Joe: I'm not sure because my Nc3 is protected.  Jack: It's because I knew that you would play Nd5 with which your c2 pawn is unprotected.  So, it's up to you.  Well, that led me to making the right choice because it is certainly not worth a pawn.  With stronger players, it's generally not a piece, but rather, a pawn that makes or breaks the game as this mentor has emphasized.  Therefore, I play this, to allow my Nc3 to move since it is now defended again."

By, overlooking his had two Rooks against one in a back rank.  So, when he captured, I resigned because recaptured is forced, with which, he would've mated me at once.  Knowing that, combined with comments from bhidragon about those basic threats, I figured out what Jack wants, and I put a stop to it.

But, right after that combined with me being out of time (as I must get ready for work) we both agreed on a draw.  In the aftermath, we studied the variations together, and it turns out that this is, certainly, a draw.  If it had continued, I would've gone after Jack's pawn again with 63.Rh4.  Likewise, he would've defended again with 63...Kg2.  So, I'd recheck with 64.Rg4+.  And, those moves would repeat themselves and become a draw by repetition.  But, Jack said that the other way to draw would be if I did not go back and forth.  Therefore, it's what else would happen after 63.Rh4 Kg2.  In this case, 64.Nxe5 fxe5 65.Rxh2 Kxh2 66.Ke4 which allows 67.Kxe5  After which, it is a dead position which is also a draw as we're only left with the K's.  And, there was 2 games that I drawed with a dead position.  This happened before joining this website.  So, the summary is that Jack said that I went wrong by moving too quickly in the beginning which is why he allowed me to draw this game.  I agree with my coach, but he, as usual, he is not completely accurate.  Where I agree was the urge to play Nd5 too early.  The first one was 11.Nd5?? which would have left me a piece down.  And, the second instance was 16.Nd5 which would've lost a pawn.  So, he is correct in that sense.  But, what Jack did not point out was where I also went wrong.  In this case, it was 53.Rd7?  I would've had a win with 53.Kd5! as the K supports the pawn.  It also has to do with mobility since the K and passed pawn would work together to force the promotion.  Thus, while I need to take a little longer due to the opening, my assessment on mobility needs work.  I have gotten better at thinking more about it.  But, when to apply it is still shaky.  As I didn't think about it in the place where it was needed the most.  So, the real moral of this story is that mobility is one of the most important aspects in chess.  And, where to apply it is critical.  What I have learned from this game is that it's needed more in the endgame then any other phases of the game."
