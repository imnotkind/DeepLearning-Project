0,0,0,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I wasn't sure what I was thinking at this point. I usually consult opening databases to reason about each move before I made the decision. I guess I just wasn't keen on 3. dxe5 dxe5 4. Qxd8  Kxd8. I'll have to come back to this game again after checking out this opening.
1,0,1,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp3pp/3pbn2/3Np1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I felt my king side pawn structure was busted ... trying for O-O-O instead.
2,0,2,Bf7,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2b1p/3p1p2/3Np3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Not quite sure why I did this. Perhaps I was uncomfortable with the bishop dangling defenselessly at e6 while his knight was in a fairly offensive position?
3,0,3,1Nd5,b'2kr3r/pppq1bbp/2np1p2/3Np3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 b - -',doubling his attack on my weak f pawn.
4,0,4,1Bxd5,b'2kr3r/pppq2bp/2np1p2/3bp3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I felt the need for the trade.
5,0,5,1Bxd5,b'2kr3r/pppq2bp/2np1p2/3Bp3/4P3/5Q2/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Not quite sure if 14 exd5 would have been better for him. My knight would have to go away and his pawn would still remain very defensible while being stuck literally right down my throat.
6,0,6,Kb8,b'1k3r1r/pppqn1bp/3p1p2/4p2B/4P3/5Q2/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Had to take the time to keep my king safe.
7,0,7,1a4,b'1k3r1r/pp1qn1bp/2pp4/4pp1B/PPP1P3/5Q2/4NPPP/R4RK1 b - a3',That was a little alarming. Especially if he manages to put some pieces behind that pawn structure for the final push towards my king after the pawns poke holes into his defenses.
8,0,8,d5,b'1k3r1r/pp1qn1bp/2p5/3pp2B/PPP1Q3/8/4NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Gonna use my numerical advantage to reduce the queen side threat while driving his queen away.
9,0,9,e4,b'1k5r/pp2n1bp/2p5/3p2r1/PPP1p1B1/5P2/4N1PP/R4RK1 w - -',My turn to poke a little hole in his defenses.
10,0,10,3Bg4,b'7r/p1k1n1bp/2p5/1p2r3/PPpN2BP/8/6P1/2R2RK1 b - -',Freeing his f rook and trying for a e6 fork on my bishop I believe.
11,0,11,a6,b'7r/2k1n2p/p1p4b/1p2r3/PPpN2BP/8/6P1/R4RK1 w - -',Giving him dominion over the a file but I preserve the pawn structure.
12,0,12,3Kh1,b'7r/4n2p/p1pkN2b/1p2r3/PPp3BP/8/6P1/R4R1K b - -',Not quite sure why he thought Be3  was so deadly that he decided to give me some tempo.
13,0,13,3Nd5,b'7r/7p/p1pkN2b/1p1nr3/PPp3BP/8/6P1/R4R1K w - -',"Decided that the b4 pawn was ""it""."
14,0,14,Rxe6,b'7r/7p/p1pkr2b/1p1n4/PPp3BP/8/6P1/3R1R1K w - -',Learned this trick from an earlier game. I needed numerical superiority more than raw power at this point. Decided to throw a rook in exchange for fewer pieces on his side getting in my way.
15,0,15,3a5,b'7r/7p/p1p1k2b/Pp1n4/1Pp4P/8/6P1/3R1R1K b - -',Not sure why he did this. Was he afraid of bxa4? In the face of 2 rooks I'd rather keep that pawn structure intact. Anyway that bought me another tempo to bring my rook (finally) into action.
16,0,16,3Rfe1+,b'5r2/7p/p1p1k2b/Pp1n4/1Pp4P/8/6P1/3RR2K b - -',He wisely declined the poisoned exchange hehe.
17,0,17,Bf4,b'5r2/3k3p/p1p5/Pp1n4/1Pp2bPP/8/8/3RR2K w - -',I had to get my bishop out before I am forced to lose time doing the same thing later when his pawns are dangerously closer.
18,0,18,3Rd4,b'5r2/3k3p/p1p5/Pp1n4/1PpR1bPP/8/8/4R2K b - -',Not sure what he wanted to achieve with that since my bishop was very well guarded.
19,0,19,3c3,b'5r2/3k3p/p1p5/Pp1n4/1P1R1bPP/2p5/8/4R2K w - -',So I took the extra time to push the pawn and threaten to promote it on a square I control at c1. If he failed to do anything about it he would have to lose a rook to prevent the promotion.
20,0,20,Bd2,b'5r2/3k3p/p1p5/Pp1n4/1P1R2PP/2p5/3bR3/7K w - -',Rook for a Bishop pawn looked like a good exchange at this point. I cannot remember if I was trying to prevent Rc2 (which does not seem so bad to me now) or whether I was vacating f4 so my rook could go there for a devastating attack on his pawns effectively forcing him to trade rooks.
21,0,21,Nxf4,b'8/3k3p/p1p5/Pp4P1/1P3n1P/2p5/3bR3/7K w - -',I think I preferred Nxf4 to Bxf4 because it deters h5 and g6 while also forcing his rook to go away.
22,0,22,4Rf2,b'8/3k3p/p1p5/Pp4P1/1P3n1P/2p5/3b1R2/7K b - -',"He really should not have done that there was no threat on the knight so it simply gives me another tempo to get my king away from the d file. The reason will be clear in the later moves.

"
23,0,23,c2,b'8/4k2p/p1p5/Pp4P1/1P3n1P/8/2pb1R1K/8 w - -',If my king was still in d7 this would not have been possible. Promotion was inevitable now.
24,0,24,Kf7,b'8/5k1p/p1p5/Pp4P1/1P3n1P/6K1/8/2b5 w - -',The rationale for this was to prevent his king from doing anything useful king side. His pawns are already stuck queen side.
25,0,25,5Kg3,b'8/7p/p1p5/Pp4Pk/1P3n1P/6K1/8/2b5 b - -',Not good for him ... if he wanted a shot at a draw he should have started going queen side.
26,0,26,Bxb4+,b'8/7p/p1pK4/Pp4k1/1b5n/8/8/8 w - -',Figured I can afford to trade pawns since I can pretty much guarantee the h pawn promotion.
27,0,27,Bd8,b'3b4/7p/K7/6k1/1p5n/8/8/8 w - -',was tempted to give the bishop away but it was not necessary.
28,0,28,h5,b'3b4/8/8/2K3kp/7n/8/8/3q4 w - h6',this is just silliness on my part couldn't quite figure out a quick way of mating so I kinda decided on the 2nd queen.
29,0,29,Nf3,b'3b4/8/8/6kp/2K5/5n2/8/3q4 w - -',It was only at this point (when I was forced to move the knight away to pursue my original plan) did I realize the knight allowed the queen much better opportunities to corner the king.

A discovered attack that doesn't create a 2nd threat isn't really hard to refute so I gang up on the knight. Black cannot defend it so he must move it - but he can't move it because it defends the b5 pawn. Zugswang! Well not exactly but how often do I get to say such a fun word?

183,5,30,4e8=Q,b'R3Q3/6k1/5p2/5P1p/2P3p1/6P1/r6P/6K1 b - -',Black snuck a pawn from me. 40. Rxa2 is a certain win but it does lose my chance to immediately promote at e8 (I could just let the e-pawn fall plant my rook on d2 and safely promote my c-pawn where black's king cannot touch it). But as played White threatens mate in 1 with 41. Qg6   so black must capture white's rook and having queen and pawn against king sounds like more fun than just rook and pawn.

191,6,5,1Ke6,b'rnbqn3/pp4pp/3pk3/2QNP3/8/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',he should have retreated his king to f7 by now and has passed up multiple opportunities to do so
192,6,6,1exd6,b'rnbqn3/pp4pp/3Pk3/2QN4/8/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Qc4 is better

195,6,9,1Nb4,b'r1bqn3/pp1k2pp/3P4/4Q3/1n3N2/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',needed to take on d6
196,6,10,2Nd5+,b'r1b1n3/ppk3pp/8/3N2q1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Ne6 IS far superior but overall my comments are only advocating better winning moves.  Apart from move 8 very well played by Nick
197,7,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White is playing the Queen's Pawn Game and his second move seems to be pushing toward the Stonewall Attack.
198,7,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White went a bit off script for the Stonewall. That pawn is usually played to c3 instead of c4. Now it looks like he has transposed into a Queen's Gambit (it's not much of a gambit now with his bishop defending the pawn at c4) maybe the Marshall Defense with the black knight at f6 though an early pawn move to e3 is not really main line for white in the Marshall Defense.
199,7,2,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black wants to castle so the bishop move clears the way. I considered 4. ... Bb4 but after 5. Bd2 we just end up exchanging bishops. I wanted to keep the position complex so exhanging pieces early was contrary to my plans in that regard. Of course white can easily play c5 at any time to drive back my bishop so e6 might not have been the wisest choice for black here.
200,7,3,dxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/8/2pP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I decided not to let white play his pawn to c5. After white's last move taking the pawn now seems to gain a little tempo.
201,7,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2p5/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',This move is contrary to my intention of keeping things complicated giving white a chance to trade queens if he wants simplification. But I felt I needed to challenge his center.
202,7,5,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/8/2Bp4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',White castled into a little trap and now I'll present him a little teaser where what seems to be the best move will cost him a pawn - one of his castle pawns which leaves his king somewhat exposed (and this will play a role later in the middle game).
203,7,6,Bxh2+,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2BN4/2N1P3/PP3PPb/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',White can choose not to capture the bishop. Either way he has already lost a pawn with no recompense.
204,7,7,Qc7+,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/8/2BN4/2N1P3/PP3PPK/R1BQ1R2 w - -',Long range fork. Check and the bishop on c4 will fall.
205,7,8,Qxc4,b'rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2qN4/2N1P1P1/PP3P1K/R1BQ1R2 w - -',Black is up a pawn and he has ruined white's castle. Of note is the fact that we have opposite colored bishops and eventually if white is allowed to exchange everything else off the board black cannot force a win with K B P vs. K B when the bishops are on opposite colors.
206,7,9,a6,b'rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/1N6/2q5/2N1P1P1/PP3P1K/R1BQ1R2 w - -',Black cannot leave the knight on b5 where it is just one move away from c7 where it wins the rook on a8. The black queen defends c7 for now but she can be easily chased and being tied to the defense of c7 limits her scope. Also with a6 black gives his rook freedom to escape if white's knight is ever played to c7.
207,7,10,Qc5,b'rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/p2Npn2/2q5/8/2N1P1P1/PP3P1K/R1BQ1R2 w - -',d6 dangerous place for the white knight. It has no credible threats and it can be easily attacked. As I noted after black's 11th move black is in favor of white playing Nxc8 as that eliminates the opposite colored bishop ending.
208,7,11,Rd8,b'rnbr2k1/1p3ppp/p2Npn2/2q5/P7/2N1P1P1/1P3P1K/R1BQ1R2 w - -',I don't know what the pawn on a4 is good for. Perhaps white was thinking about playing his rook to b3 to threaten black's pawn on b7. But his knight is still in a precarious position and now I pin it there. White seems to have no escape. If 15. Nxb7 or 15. N(d6)e4 to threaten black's queen black can play 15. ... Rxd1 and now white's rook is en prise and white loses material. It's interesting to note how destructive 9. ... Bxh2  was to white's position. If white's king stood next to his rook on f1 white's knight could escape this pin and even win the pawn on b7 (black couldn't play 15. Bxb7? for white wins a rook with Qxd8 ).
209,7,12,Rxd6,b'rnb3k1/1p3ppp/p2rpn2/2q5/P7/2N1PQP1/1P3P1K/R1B2R2 w - -',Eat the knight before it escapes especially since now it can capture at b7 guarded by its queen.
210,7,13,Rxd1,b'rnb3k1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2q5/P7/2N1PQP1/1P3P1K/R1Br4 w - -',Black is ahead by knight and pawn and more than willing to liquidate pieces. White dubiously offers the first of the liquidations.
211,7,14,Nbd7,b'r1b3k1/1p1n1ppp/p3pn2/2q5/P7/2N1P1P1/1P3P1K/R1BQ4 w - -',Of course white has Qd8  but black's queen can save the day with Qf8. However this takes black's queen out of the center of the board and puts white on the offensive so I deem it best to prevent the move which also serves to broaden my queen's scope once she's not tied to preventing checkmate. In retrospect I think the better move would have been 17. ... Qh5  to force the trading of queens. 
212,7,15,b5,b'r1b3k1/3n1ppp/p3pn2/Ppq5/8/2N1P1P1/1P3P1K/R1BQ4 w - b6',Opens up my bishop and I wouldn't mind if white captures en passant.
213,7,16,Bb7,b'r5k1/1b1n1ppp/p3pn2/Ppq5/8/4P1P1/1P2NP1K/R1BQ4 w - -',White's 19. Ne2 seems to serve little purpose. It has nowhere to move that presents any threat to black. In fact it opens up e4 which looks like a great home for a black knight. But I choose a move that might give me an opportunity to pin and exchange white's knight.
214,7,17,Bxe2,b'r5k1/3n1ppp/p3pn2/Ppq5/8/BP2P1P1/4bP1K/R2Q4 w - -',OK let's exchange. If 22. Bxc5 Bxd1 23. Rxd1 Nxc5 black comes out a piece ahead and his rook protects against the back-rank checkmate.
215,7,18,Qh5+,b'r5k1/3n1ppp/p3pn2/Pp5q/8/BP2P1P1/4QP1K/R7 w - -',White played the only move that didn't lose material and black finally plays the move he should have played 5 moves ago.
216,7,19,Nxh5,b'r5k1/3n1ppp/p3p3/Pp5n/8/BP2P1P1/5P1K/R7 w - -',Queens are gone the opposite-bishop ending has been prevented and black has a winning material advantage. Time to figure out how to win with it.
217,7,20,f6,b'r5k1/6pp/p3pp2/Pp2n2n/8/BP2P1P1/5PK1/3R4 w - -',This was a bad move by black. I wanted freedom for my king to get off of the bank rank and make himself useful. I wanted to move towards the center so the f-pawn made sense to me but 25. ... f5 makes my pawn at e6 backward. However as played my knight on h5 is now trapped and falls after 26. f4 and 27. g4.
218,7,21,Nc6,b'r5k1/6pp/p1n1pp2/Pp5n/5P2/BP2P1P1/6K1/3R4 w - -',OK if I must lose the knight maybe I can win a couple pawns for it. I anticipate white's next move but it wins me one pawn after 27. Rd6 Nxa5 28. Rxe6 Nxb3 and now black has adjacent passed pawns on the a and b files and has extended his material advantage.
219,7,22,Nc4,b'r5k1/6pp/p2Rpp2/1p5n/1Pn2P2/B3P1P1/6K1/8 w - -',Aha! White fell into my trap but he missed the other outcome namely that his doomed pawn at b3 was required to remain home and suffer the consequences because it prevented this fork. It's not the deadliest fork since white can avoid losing material with 29. Rd3 Nxa3 30. Rxa3 but black has just won a pawn extending his lead and now exchanges knight for bishop liquidating more material.
220,7,23,Nxa3,b'r5k1/6pp/p3Rp2/1p5n/1P3P2/n3P1P1/6K1/8 w - -',I guess white missed the saving move so I'll grab my bonus material. Compensation for my doomed knight on h5.
221,7,24,Nc2,b'r5k1/6pp/p3Rp2/1p5n/1P3PP1/4P3/2n3K1/8 w - -',I could have played 30. ... Nxf4 to capture at least one pawn in exchange for the doomed knight. But I think adjacent passed pawns on the queenside is a better way to gain a pawn. I truly expected white to defend with 31. Re4 which allows my knight to escape his doom with 31. ... f5 32. Pxf5 Nf6 and now white must save his rook but all the squares on the 4th rank are covered so he cannot continue to protect his pawn at b4. End result an even exchange of pawns and black's knight escapes with that deadly pair of passed pawns on the queenside.
222,7,25,Nxb4,b'r5k1/6pp/p3Rp2/1p5P/1n3P2/4P3/6K1/8 w - -',Maybe white figured out the combination I just described and decided on the move that wins him material. Either way black has now accomplished his overwhelming advantage on the queenside and white is doomed.
223,7,26,a5,b'r7/5kpp/4Rp2/pp3P1P/1n6/4P1K1/8/8 w - -',The kingside is locked. Time to promote a pawn (or two).
224,7,27,g6,b'r7/5k1p/4RppP/1p3P2/pn4K1/4P3/8/8 w - -',Not 35. ... Pxh6? 36. Kh5 Kg7 37. Re7  and now black must lose both H-pawns and white gains a pawn majority and a strong attack on the kingside. The move as played retains the lock blocking white's king's advance. Of course white cannot capture at g6 because he loses his rook and even with another capture at h7 he cannot promote his passed pawns due to black's rook on a1.
225,7,28,Nd5,b'r7/5k1p/1R3ppP/1p1n1P2/p5K1/4P3/8/8 w - -',The only move to defend the b5 pawn was 36. ... Ra5 tying my rook to dfense and allowing white a probable draw with perpetual check Rb7  and Rb8  (if black moves away from g6 white threatens to promote a pawn with Pxb6). Black might be able to stave off destruction after 36. ... Ra5 37. Rb7  Ne2 but 38. Pxg6 thratens to promote a white pawn. I think black can hold out with 38. ... Kxg6 and now white has no more attacks to dislodge the black king. However I am worried that I might have overlooked something and it just seems imprudent to allow white to play for that combination when it can be prevented. As played I can now save my pawn with 37. ... b4. White must move his rook it is en prise. And no matter what he does black can play 37. ... Nxe3 .
226,7,29,Nxe3+,b'r7/5k1p/5ppP/1R3P2/p5K1/4n3/8/8 w - -',White exchanged pawns as expected. But now black's knight has a second fork against king and pawn.
227,7,30,Nxf5,b'r7/5k1p/5ppP/1R3n2/p4K2/8/8/8 w - -',And now black's kingside is perfectly secure white has no perpetual check while black can safely hide on his own back rank or safely block with his knight. And black's pawn at a4 is clear to advance.
228,7,31,Kg8,b'r5k1/1R5p/5ppP/5n2/p4K2/8/8/8 w - -',White stalled and now he's out of steam. White probably wants to get his king into the center to block the black knight's best squares and to try to support his rook in stopping the advancing black pawn but he is blocked from approaching the center (without going all the way down through f3 to e2 unless he moves his rook to a safer square first. 
229,7,32,Nd6+,b'r5k1/1R5p/3n1ppP/8/p3K3/8/8/8 w - -',And now white commits his ultimate sin and black is unwilling to offer mercy. White wanted the center just like I had expected he would but he failed to observe the consequences of not going the long way around.
230,7,33,a3,b'r5k1/1n5p/4KppP/8/8/p7/8/8 w - -',No need to save a pawn that isn't doing anything when another pawn is busily winning the game.
231,7,34,Ra6,b'6k1/1n2K2p/r5pP/8/8/8/p7/8 w - -',White is making it easy on black approaching an edge of the board. Time for black to limit the white king's range. At this point I announced mate in 5.
232,7,35,a1=Q,b'6k1/1n1K3p/r5pP/8/8/8/8/q7 w - -',My opponent didn't return to this game right away allowing me some free time to explore the Conditional Moves feature. By the time I was done I had entered 23 combinations that covered every possible avenue of white moves from now through checkmate. A couple days later when I was offline I received a message that I had won this game by checkmate and I wasn't even there.
233,7,36,Nc5,b'2K3k1/7p/r5pP/2n5/8/8/8/q7 w - -',Saves the knight and defends the rook from a square the white king cannot reach.
234,7,37,Ra8#,b'r2K2k1/1q5p/6pP/2n5/8/8/8/8 w - -',"Final position. 49. ... Qd7   would have also worked but 22 of my 23 Conditional Move combinations ended with black making the exact same moves from 46 through 49. The only different combination was if white played 46. Ke8 Qf6 47. Kd7 Qd8   because it was 2 moves faster (hence prettier). On a side note I wish the Conditional Moves feature allowed some kind of wildcard for my opponent's move so that I could have essentially said ""whatever white plays I play this one move in response. A feature like that would have allowed me to enter just a single Contitional Move sequence to arrive at this position (white's king might end on e8) instead of entering 23 combinations. In any case it was a fun exercise to work out all the combinations."

My pawn at d3 is twice defended and awkward for him to get even a 2nd attacker on it. Maybe he didn't want me to threaten his queen with 7. Bg5 but it seems to me he could easily play Qd6 when and if I play Bg5 - it didn't seem necessary to run away beforehand. As played black seems to be losing a tempo for no real gain. Now there is little point to 7. Bg5 so I bring out my knight first looking at c4 as a good home for a knight maybe even gaining another tempo as I chase away the black queen that didn't need to move to d6 in the first place.

The move as played exposes a discovered check by white's bishop at B5 but black cannot afford to capture the undefended bishop because if 16. ... Rxb5?? then 17. Pb8=Q . Black must move his king to allow his queen to prevent the pawn's promotion.
245,8,10,1Bxa5,b'5qnr/1Pp1k3/1p1p1p2/BB4pp/4P1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And now the rook falls.

White needs to find a way to make big things happen while I'm so far in the lead materially and positionally. The move as played seems like a good way to prepare to protect my advanced pawn while also putting pressure on the long diagonal from a2 to g8.
247,8,12,1Bc4,b'5qnr/1Pp1k3/3pbp2/p5pp/2B1P3/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black closes the diagonal and now I prepare to exchange material.

If black accepts the sacrifice by 21. ... Pxd4 white responds with 22. Qc8 and wins the black queen.

He is now in check and cannot move to the back rank which allows 23. b8=Q  Ke8 24. Q(b5)b7  . If he moves away from white's pawn with 22. Ke8 white simply plays b8=Q and wins with a crushing material advantage.
250,8,15,2Ne6+,b'5qnr/1Pk5/3pNp2/pQp3pp/4P3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black chose to chase the advanced pawn so that both his king and queen could cover b8 and prevent the promotion but now white has Mate in 3.

251,8,16,2Qa6,b'1k3qnr/1P6/Q2pNp2/p1p3pp/4P3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I could take the undefended queen but why bother? In fact 24. Nxf8? deserves a ? in this position. Not counting deliberate queen sacrifices how often is capturing a free queen the inferior move? As played white threatens 25. Qa8   and there's nothing black can do to stop it.
252,8,17,2Qa8#,b'Qkq3nr/1P6/3pNp2/p1p3pp/4P3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',A trooper to the end black saves his queen from the knight and now threatens 25. ... Qxb7 to eliminate the advanced pawn. I guess he is hoping white won't play either of his two mating moves in this position. I could have chosen 25.

267,10,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Again with the Sicilian. I'm trying to work out my dislike of this defense so I keep masochistically playing it. Not that it's bad; quite the contrary. It's just a personal thing I guess. Side note: why have I played black in 67% of my games?
268,10,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Center Game and not white's best line. So far on GK I have played 12 games as black and seen this opening (at least the first 3 moves) by white twice. I now gain a tempo developing a knight that attacks the white queen.
269,10,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',After white retreated all the way home I've now developed two pieces to her none and our control of the center seems fairly even.
270,10,3,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2B1n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Left the e4 pawn hanging. I feared an opening trap of some kind but the only one I see can be easily refuted.
271,10,4,Nd6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2nn4/3Q4/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',White played what I expected and I played my only move that saves the knight and avoids instant checkmate.
272,10,5,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/3n4/3Q4/1nB5/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Hoping white will keep up her attack on f7 by playing 7. Qh5 allowing me to win a pawn and the exchange with 7. ... Nxc4 8 Nxc4 Nxc2 . Hope chess? Maybe but white had demonstrated an eagerness to hit me at f7 so I thought it reasonable to expect she might continue. Even so attacking the queen with the eventual threat of Nxc2  still seems a worthy move no matter how white responds.
273,10,6,Nxc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2Q5/1nn5/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Now white cannot capture by 9. Nxc4? because of 9. ... Nxc2 . 
274,10,7,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/1nQ5/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq e6',Defends my knight and advances into the center.
275,10,8,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/2Q5/N4N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I considered several dfenses of the pawn but f3 limits my queen's freedom and weakens my kingside castle d3 loses my knight by removing the bishop's protection Bd6 blocks my d-pawn and seems a precarious perch for the bishop with no ready defenders save for my queen and Qe2 blocks my bishop. Qf3 might have been OK but white would gain a tempo with Bg5. So I retreat the knight to a safer square but it still feels like a retreat.
276,10,9,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3pp1N1/2Q5/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq d6',See? I knew white had a singular atraction to my pawn at f7. It's easy enough to shut out the white queen now with a gain of tempo and a more imposing center.
277,10,10,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n5/3pp1N1/7Q/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',White voluntarily pinned her queen behind her knight. My bishop move removes white's option to play Nf3 and clears the way for me to castle though I'm not yet sure that castling king-side is safe (obviously not right away with Qxh7   so first I would deal with that then figure out if castling is safe).
278,10,11,Bxg5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n5/3pp1b1/5P1Q/N7/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Dangit I don't want that pawn sitting there unmolested nor do I want to break up my center just yet not when white offered me a passed pawn.
279,10,12,Bf5,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n5/3ppbP1/7Q/N7/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Mmmmm passed pawns the stuff of fortune and fame. My bishop move is designed to strand the knight on a3 to defense even if only momentarily but more importantly I cover h7 and g6 too.
280,10,13,Be4,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n5/3pp1P1/4b2Q/N7/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Maybe Bg6 would be safer but this central poisition is unassailable for now and puts pressure on white's kingside while still holding down white's knight and covring my own kingside pawns.
281,10,14,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3pp1PQ/4b3/N7/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Again with the f7? White is single-minded in her assault on f7. But now castling is safe and the pawn at f7 is snug as a rug with that rook backing him up.
282,10,15,Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/8/3pp1P1/3nb1Q1/N7/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Not sure what white was trying for with Qg4. Seeing no more threats I press forward and go pawn hunting. I expect 18. c3 to save the pawn for good after which I plan to play 18. ... Ne6.
283,10,16,Nxc2,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/8/3pp1P1/4b1QP/N7/PPn3P1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Aha now I see. White's plan is to get more pawns into her assault so her prvious move 17. Qg4 was to get out of the way. But she left a hanging pawn leaving me up by two pawns and with a pair of adjacent passed pawns in the center and now white must play Nxc2 or lose at least the exchange.
284,10,17,Bxg6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/6b1/3pp3/6QP/8/PP4P1/R1B2RK1 w - -',White's plan was well-intended but she overlooked the fact that I have kept my bishop on this very diagonal since my 14th move for just this reason (thought I thought it was a prevention not a cure).
285,10,18,Qb6+,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1q4b1/3pp1B1/6QP/8/PP4P1/R4RK1 w - -',I could block by 21. ... f6 but my king is bottled up tight so I figured why not claim one more pawn since I haven't yet had my fill.
286,10,19,Rc2,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/1q4b1/3pp1B1/7P/8/PPr1QRP1/R5K1 w - -',Hehe white forgot about the long diagonal on her 20th move might she forget about it again? After she gets her queen to safety I have my rook and my queen bearing down on her pinned rook at f2. This limits the options for the queen. If white does retreat the queen say by 24. Qf1 then I am quite willing to liquidate with 24. ... Qxf8  25. Qxf8 Rxf8 26. Kxf8 leaving us each with one rook and one bishop but black has the three pawn lead and those adjacent passed pawns in the center.
287,10,20,Rxb2,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/1q4b1/3pp3/7P/8/Pr1BQRP1/R5K1 w - -',Free pawns. White's 24. Bd2 prevented the liquidation but also left the b2 pawn hanging. Now white's bishop is pinned to the queen and her rook is pinned to the king but I don't see any good way to immediately exploit that. I am considering advancing the e-pawn going for the fork on e6 but white could then just play Qxe6 which allows me to follow through with my liquidation plans but at the cost of a pawn.
288,10,21,Qd4,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/6b1/3pp3/3q3P/8/Pr1BQRPK/R7 w - -',To pressure the bishop - it's well defended but it is pinned and pressure is good. I'm seeing some interesting combinations that involve liquidating a few white pieces and with my material advantage and two eager center pawns itching for promotion I would love to liquidate. Very much.
289,10,22,Qxh4+,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/6b1/3pp3/7q/8/Pr1BQRPK/3R4 w - -',White threatened a discover attack that didn't really change much. If I allowed 27. Be3 I could simply respond with Rxe2 28. Bxd4 Rxf2 29. Bxf2 and I've accomplished the better half of my liquidation plans. But I might have better so I try something different.
290,10,23,f6,b'5rk1/pp4pp/5pb1/3pp3/7q/8/Pr1BQRP1/3R2K1 w - -',Defending my center.
291,10,24,Qxg3+,b'5rk1/pp4pp/5pb1/3pp3/8/6q1/Pr1BQR2/3R2K1 w - -',I think the tragic loss of all her pawn personnel has driven white a little stir-crazy. 28. g3 just feeds me more pawns. It's like an all-you-can-eat pawn buffet. I'm already stuffed! I can't recall ever playing a game in which either side had a 6-pawn lead (all pawns the bigger pieces are dead even).
292,10,25,Qh4,b'5rk1/pp4pp/5pb1/3pp3/7q/8/Pr1BQ1R1/3R2K1 w - -',My cunning plan is 30 ... Bh5 working on my liquidation efforts and winning the exchange in the process.
293,10,26,Bh5,b'5rk1/pp4pp/5p2/3pp2b/6Rq/8/Pr1BQ3/3R2K1 w - -',But white offered me something better. Now 31. Rxh4 Bxe2 and now white cannot save the rook at d1 and the bishop at d2 except for 32. Bc3 Bxd1 33. Bxb2 and I have accomplished the lion's share of my liquidation.
294,10,27,Kxg7,b'5r2/pp4kp/5p2/3pp2b/7q/8/Pr1BQ3/3R2K1 w - -',White has no followup so I'll take the sacrifice.
295,10,28,Qg4,b'5r2/pp4kp/5p2/3pp2b/6q1/8/Pr1B2Q1/3R2K1 w - -',And now we trade queens. This kind of liquidation the kind where I gain material is my favorite kind.

298,11,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi everybody!  It was time for Round 5 with Master Freddy and guess what I lost!  Yup this furry white kitten has taken another cattermauling.  It is sooo maddening and frustrating.  This time I decided to kick off with a d4 opening and Freddy decided to go Dutch with f5.  I chose what I thought were the best moves from the World DB i.e. those which would get me a decent piece placement and pawn centre in the middlegame.  Then Freddy took me out of the database with a queen move.  Then Freddy handed my position some hemlock with this queen move.  Later on in the game after dropping a couple of pawns I tried to break free with a few spite checks and a mate threat but all to no avail - it was only token resistance.
299,11,1,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4. Bg2 - pretty standard play against the Dutch - white usually fianchettoes his/her bishop along the h1 - a8 diagonal.  Some nasty pins can occur as a result of this bishop's occupation.  In fact a few moves later I try a double fianchetto taking a leaf out of Coach Ion's book - remember in our last game he used a double fianchetto against me which proved decisive in his favour!  So why not use it on Master Freddy eh?

Ba3 - had a good win percentage in the db - it pins the d pawn from taking the e pawn so to avoid being a pawn down black has to recapture with the knight and now an exchange of knights occur on e5.  The downside of this exchange is that it brings out the Wicked Witch of the West onto a good square - she comes with a barreload of hemlock on her broomstick!

361,14,1,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',White deviates from the main line. I'm not sure d3 best place for his bishop because now it has no moves unless it moves backwards to e2 or f1 but it does defend the e4 pawn. Black's move offers white's d3 bishop more scope but it gets black more presence in the center.
362,14,2,cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now black's pawns are undoubled and he seems to have gained a tempo since both sides have one piece developed but black has the only pawn in the center.

Bb5  and now if black blocks with Bd7 the pawn at d5 would have no defender so black would have to play Kf8 ruining his castling and imiting the scope of the rook at h8.
364,14,4,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/2p1bb2/3p4/8/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',Apparently white didn't want me to kill his b2 pawn and a1 rook hence his 12. c3 move. It buys me time to castle. And now black has more tempi with 3 developed pieces to white's two and still the more dominant center.

369,14,9,c5,b'5rk1/p4p1p/1r1qbbp1/2pp4/1P6/2PB1N2/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',White's pawn advance to b4 takes a little pressure off of his b-pawn but leaves his pawn at c3 backward and defended only by his queen. Black's move to c5 offers to open blacks's attack on the c-file where his queen and rook (f1) can join his bishop in the attack on the c3 pawn. Truth is I didn't expect to win the c3 pawn but was hoping to open up channels to the a2 pawn which seemed like a real possibility here given the combinations I was seeing at this time. White might have maintained the status quo with 18. a3. 
370,14,10,Qxc5,b'5rk1/p4p1p/1r2bbp1/2qp4/8/2PB1N2/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',Now it's 2 against 1 attacking the pawn at c3. Notice how black has converted his tempo advantage into an attack and white despite going first is on the defensive.
371,14,11,axb6,b'5rk1/5p1p/1p2bbp1/2qp4/8/2PB1N2/P1Q2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',And now I have two half-open files to aim at whites a and c pawns as needed. Sure he has two half-open files to aim at black's b and d pawns but black is attacking and white is defending. Tempo.
372,14,12,d4,b'5rk1/5p1p/1p2bbp1/2q1N3/3p4/2PB4/P1Q2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',White blocks black's f6 bishop. Black's pawn advance threatens the knight by opening my queen's attack on e5. It also threatens the pawn at c3. White can handle both of these threats quite easily. But black's pawn advance to d4 also exposed an attack on white's pawn at a2 by black's bishop at e6.
373,14,13,Qxd4,b'5rk1/5p1p/1p2bbp1/4N3/3q4/3B4/P1Q2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Not 21. ... Qxc2? 22. Bxc2 and white is ahead by a pawn. After black plays Bxa2 the game is even. As played white's knight is still in danger.
374,14,14,Qd5,b'5rk1/5p1p/1pN1bbp1/3q4/8/3B4/P1Q2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Black's queen evades the knight's attack and puts pressure on a2. Also threatened is 23. ... Rc8 pinning white's knight 24. Rc1 Bd2. But white can squirm out of it by playing Be4 to defend the knight. What I really expected by moving to d4 was what white actually played - the obvious move.
375,14,15,Qa5,b'5rk1/5p1p/1p2bbp1/q7/1N6/3B4/P1Q2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',After white's obvious move I now pin the knight to the undefended rook on e1. Clearly white cannot move the knight or he will be checkmated. Black threatens Be7 to assault the knight. White cannot defend by 24. a3 because black will play Qxa3 and will finally have that material advantage he's been hunting for the last 7 moves. Still this attack isn't quite enough since white can defend the knight with rook and queen. I am expecting 24. Rb1 to both defend and unpin the knight followed by 24. ... Be7. Now white must move the knight removing a defender of the a2 pawn and allowing black to take the pawn or defend the knight with his queen forcing her to do double duty whereupon black plans to play Bd5 or Bd1 to protect the pawn at b3 then exchange the knight and queen leaving the pawn undefended at a2 so the black bishop at e6 can take the pawn. A lot of work for a pawn and white can squirm out of it with careful play.
376,14,16,Bxa2,b'5rk1/5p1p/1p3bp1/q7/1N6/3B4/b2Q1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',24. Qd2? was a blunder for white. The queen is doing double duty and cannot protect both the knight at the pawn. And white cannot play 25. Nxa2?? because the knight is pinned to the undefended queen. The a2 pawn finally falls after black has been working on this pawn jockeying for position for 8 moves.
377,14,17,Qxd2,b'5rk1/5p1p/1pN2bp1/8/8/3B4/b2q1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Of course 25. Nc6?? was a huge blunder and it cost white the game. After black's move white resigned. Now he cannot save the bishop at d3. After 26. Re3 Qd8  27. Bf1 Bc5 still wins the white bishop (as if being up by queen pawn wasn't enough). I confess to being dumbfounded by white's careless 25th move. Clearly white realized that 25. Nxa2?? would cost him his queen (else why didn't he just take the bishop to win the piece?) but then he chose another knight move instead. This was a very surprise ending to an otherwise well-contested game.

So many times in my career I have had a massive positional advantage but was unable to convert it into a win and have had to settle for a draw - but this time I didn't even need to convert it for my opponent to resign. But the thing that surprised me was that it seems to me that at least in the short term Black's position can at least be held. He is beginning to break through my positional blockade and my attack might not last long - for example after 22...Kh7 (only move as 22...Kh8 23.Qg8#) 23.Qg7  Kg6 and what then? How do I press my attack? And should Black have resigned?

426,16,32,2Ne3,b'1k5r/ppp4p/1q4p1/3p4/3nr3/1P2N2Q/P4PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Hmm I thought he would trade Knights but I guess he would rather pick on my peasant.
427,16,33,2Ne2+,b'1k5r/ppp4p/1q4p1/3p4/4r3/1P2N2Q/P3nPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',A fortunate fork!
428,16,34,Nxc1,b'1k5r/ppp4p/1q4p1/3p4/4r3/1P2N2Q/P4PPP/2n2R1K w - -',This should turn the tide.
429,16,35,d4,b'1k5r/ppp4p/1q4p1/8/3pr3/1P2N2Q/P4PPP/2R4K w - -',I need the d file.
430,16,36,2Nc4,b'1k5r/ppp4p/1q4p1/8/2Npr3/1P5Q/P4PPP/2R4K b - -',Thank you!
431,16,37,2Qe6,b'1k5r/ppp4p/4q1p1/8/2Npr3/1P5Q/P4PPP/2R4K w - -',When I made this move I failed to notice his Queen could capture.  It won't matter in fact it may be advantageous to trade them but I must focus!
432,16,38,Rxe6,b'1k5r/ppp4p/4r1p1/8/2Np4/1P6/P4PPP/2R4K w - -',This should work for me.  I'm sure 4u is wishing he'd lost his Knight rather than his Rook.
433,16,39,2g3,b'1k5r/ppp4p/4r1p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P4P1P/2R4K b - -',The Keep of last resorts.  I'd do the same in his shoes.  Black has no diagonal assault pieces and the King himself will defend his serfs from g2!
434,16,40,2Re2,b'1k5r/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rP1P/2R4K w - -',Where he will now run..
435,16,41,2Kg2,b'1k5r/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rPKP/2R5 b - -',Tucked in tight he is.
436,16,42,2Rhe8,b'1k2r3/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rPKP/2R5 w - -',I was thinking that I didn't want to loose control of the e file but Rf8 attacking the f2 pawn might have been better...
437,16,43,2Rd1,b'1k2r3/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rPKP/3R4 b - -',Scratch that last thought.
438,16,44,2Rf8,b'1k3r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rPKP/3R4 w - -',Rf8 WOULD have been better.  Still should be good.
439,16,45,2Rf1,b'1k3r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Np4/1P4P1/P3rPKP/5R2 b - -',Yes much better.
440,16,46,2d3,b'1k3r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2N5/1P1p2P1/P3rPKP/5R2 w - -',This pawn advance should yield good results.  His Rook is stuck and he would loose his Knight to stop me.
441,16,47,d2,b'1k3r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/P1N5/1P4P1/3prPKP/5R2 w - -',So far so good.
442,16,48,d1=Q,b'1k3r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/PPN5/6P1/4rPKP/3q1R2 w - -',He surely will capture my new Queen.  Then Rfxf2  begins to chase his King.  That will be fun.  (For me anyway...)
443,16,49,3Kf1,b'1k6/ppp4p/6p1/8/PPN5/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 b - -',White Rd8 is Checkmate and I've run out of useful checks.
444,16,50,3b6,b'1k6/p1p4p/1p4p1/8/PPN5/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 w - -',Backdoor.

446,16,52,3b5,b'1k6/p1p4p/6p1/Pp6/1PN5/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 w - -',Obviation.
447,16,53,3a6,b'1k6/p1p4p/P5p1/1p6/1PN5/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 b - -',But not really.  His Rook on d8 is Checkmate again!
448,16,54,3Kc8,b'2k5/p1p4p/P5p1/1p6/1PN5/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 w - -',So the brave King steps up to the plate!
449,16,55,3Na5,b'2k5/p1p4p/P5p1/Np6/1P6/6P1/4r1rP/3R1K2 b - -',And this Knight is going to cause problems!
450,16,56,3Rgxh2,b'2k5/p1p4p/P5p1/Np6/1P6/6P1/4r2r/3R1K2 w - -',Gotta free one of my Rooks!

452,16,58,3Re8,b'2k1r3/p1p4p/P1N3p1/1p6/1P6/6P1/7r/3R1K2 w - -',So I obviate and sacrifice another peasant..

457,16,63,4Rxd1,b'1k2r3/2p4p/P5p1/1N6/1P6/6P1/6K1/3r4 w - -',Follow through strike.
458,16,64,4a7+,b'1k2r3/P1p4p/6p1/1N6/1P6/6P1/6K1/3r4 b - -',He never Quits!  Almost moved King to a8.  He would have forked my King and Rook!
459,16,65,4Kb7,b'4r3/Pkp4p/6p1/1N6/1P6/6P1/6K1/3r4 w - -',King to c8 would have allowed his Pawn to promote.  
460,16,66,4Kh3,b'4r3/Pkp4p/6p1/1N6/1P6/6PK/8/3r4 b - -',Safest move.
461,16,67,4Rd3,b'4r3/Pkp4p/6p1/1N6/1P6/3r2PK/8/8 w - -',Pins the Pawn and traps the Knight.
462,16,68,c6,b'4r3/Pk5p/2p3p1/1N6/1P5K/3r2P1/8/8 w - -',And the trap is sprung.

464,16,70,4a8=Q+,b'Q3r3/1k5p/6p1/1p6/1P4PK/3r4/8/8 b - -',I like this guy!  
465,16,71,Rf3,b'k3r3/7p/6p1/1p4K1/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',He makes me fight for every inch!
466,16,72,4Kh6,b'k3r3/7p/6pK/1p6/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 b - -',I debated letting him capture h7...
467,16,73,4Re7,b'k7/4r2p/6pK/1p6/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',But I know this guy he'll use my pawns for shields and I'll have to dig him out like a clam...
468,16,74,5Kg5,b'k7/4r2p/6p1/1p4K1/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 b - -',I'd love to do some fancy Rook work and force a superlative mate but alas such brilliance evades me 
469,16,75,5Kb8,b'1k6/4r2p/6p1/1p4K1/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',And I begin the long trek
470,16,76,Kc8,b'2k5/4r2p/6pK/1p6/1P4P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',to trap his King.  If I try something fancy I fear he'll trick me into a stalemate.
471,16,77,5Kh4,b'8/4r1kp/6p1/1p6/1P4PK/5r2/8/8 b - -',I can now force him to move his pawn.
472,16,78,Re4#,b'8/6kp/6p1/1p4P1/1P2r2K/5r2/8/8 w - -',And finish it.  Nothing spectacular but a battle for me.  Peace.
473,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Black chose the Philidor's  Defense. So I attack it to break it up.
474,17,1,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1pp1/3p3p/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I'm not sure that 4. ... h6 was called for.

476,17,3,Bc6,b'1rbqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p1Bp3p/1p2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k -',Here I was thinking along the lines of 8. ... Bb6 9. d5 followed by 10 Be3 attacking the rook which only has one place to go b8 whereupon Ba7 wins the exchange. No this isn't forced. I was only hoping for it while at the same time I'm pinning the knight on d7 and binding black's pieces.
477,17,4,1Qd5,b'1r1qkbnr/1bpn1pp1/p1Bp3p/1p1Q4/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',Black cleverly foiled my plans so I just keep attacking.
478,17,5,1Qxc6,b'1r1qkbnr/2pn1pp1/p1Qp3p/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',Keeping up the pressure but this was a horrible blunder and I didn't even know it (I guess if I knew it I wouldn't have played the move).
479,17,6,1Qxa6,b'1r1qkb1r/2pnnpp1/Q2p3p/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',This was when I realized my queen was trapped and I was going to lose her to a lowly knight. My queen only had one safe move 12. Qxa6. Black should now play 12. ... Nc5 leaving my queen with a7 or a5 both of which fall to 13. ... Nc6 14. Qa3 b4 or if I play 13 Qa3 b4 leaves the queen with only a7 or a5 and again she dies to 14. ... Nf6. All I could do now was pray that black didn't see this combination but I was sure he did because 11. Ne7 started it all so beautifully.
480,17,7,1Nd5,b'1r1qkb1r/2pnnpp1/Q2p3p/3N4/1p2P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',I couldn't believe it. b4 not only fails to finish the queen-killing combination but now she can escape to e2 if black tries to play it. I'm off the hook! So it's time to attack! I want an open e-file.
481,17,8,1exd5,b'1r1qkb1r/2pn1pp1/Q2p3p/3P4/1p6/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',Black obliges and now I can strike at his king along the e-file.
482,17,9,1Nd4,b'1r1qk2r/2pnbpp1/Q2p3p/3P4/1p1N4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',But first I try for the fork - I figure if black missed his knight combo to kill my queen maybe he's a little knight-blind so I'll give it a shot. If 15. ... 0-0? 16. Nc6 and now moving black's queen loses the exchange 16. ... Rb6 17 Qxb6 Pxb6 17. Nxd8 Rxd8 also loses the exchange. 16. ... Ra8 17. Qe2 loses even more material for now black must save his queen from the knight leaving his bishop on e7 to fall.
483,17,10,1Qe2,b'3qk2r/2pnbpp1/1r1p3p/3P4/1p1N4/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',Black cleverly avoided my tricks. Curses foiled again! Apparently I need less obvious tricks. I'm still thinking Nc6 looks really fun.
484,17,11,1Nc6,b'3q1rk1/2pnbpp1/1rNp3p/3P4/1p6/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So I played it. Now black has to lose his bishop or if he prefers he can lose the exchange with Rxc6 - which is what I thought he would do.
485,17,12,1Nxe7+,b'q4rk1/2pnNpp1/1r1p3p/3P4/1p6/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Here I should have played 18. Qxe7 which threatens the knight at d7. If black moves the knight with 18. ... Nf6 I would have 19 Qxc7 Nxd5 20. Ne7 ! which wins the exchange. This all looks better than the move I played.
486,17,13,1Qh5,b'q4r1k/2pnNpp1/1r1p3p/3P3Q/1p6/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I am looking here at some interesting combinations. If black isn't careful and makes some queen-side attack I have 20.  Bxh6! Pxh6 21. Qxh6  . If black refuses the bishop sacrifice he might try 20. ... Kh7 21. B moves anywhere is discovered checkmate. or 20. ... Nf6 21. Bxg7 ! Kxg7 22. Nf5  Kg8 23. Qa6 Ne8 24 Ne7  
487,17,14,2Qh4,b'q4r1k/2p1Npp1/1r1p1n1p/3P4/1p5Q/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Of course once again black sees through my tricks! And I thought this last try was much sneakier... My move leaves those same possibilities on the table though with black's Nh7 to block my check and no white bishop I don't think it will work so well now. I'm actually hoping for 20. ... Nxd5?? which lets me get get rolling on black's king.
488,17,15,2Nf5,b'q3r2k/2p2pp1/1r1p1n1p/3P1N2/1p5Q/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Still no mate. If 21. Bxh6? Pxh6 22. Qxh6  Nf7 and my attack peters out with a loss of material. But I can put more pressure on h6 as played.
489,17,16,2Qg3,b'q6k/2p2pp1/1r1p1n1p/3P1N2/1p2r3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Blast it now my queen is threatened and next my d5 pawn will fall leaving me only a piece up. Not enough to win a K B vs. K ending. And with black fairly well developed (once he plays Qxd5) and no really viable attacks it's looking like a long drawn out middlegame and endgame transition lies ahead. My move as played threatens mate on g7. Moving that g-pawn loses the pawn at h6 so I am expecting either Qf8 or Ne8 either of which removes an attacker from d5 allowing me to play Rd1 (yeah it's only the illusion of defense because if black plays xd5 and I respond with Rxd5?? then black plays Re1   (so I would actually play f3 firsst to drive away his rook and create an escape for my king)
490,17,17,2Qxg7#,b'7k/2p2pQ1/1r1p1n1p/3q1N2/1p2r3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',But after all that black didn't see the mate and gobbled the d5 pawn instead. This game had been lots of fun I was a bit disappointed that it ended so abruptly.
491,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A friendly unrated game played against a friend of mine - it quickly becomes very bloody.
492,18,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Nimzovich Defense.
493,18,2,Qf3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/1b1PP3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',A horrible move. Black should play Nxd4. I don't know what I was thinking but I just felt like attacking.
494,18,3,Qxc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Black let me off the hook.
495,18,4,Nf3,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n1pq2/8/3PP3/2Q2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Now it looks like black feels like attacking. At least his queen move unlike mine actually makes an attack without leaving any pieces hanging. I play the obvious defense for the threatened d4 pawn.
496,18,5,Nxd4,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3NP3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',A dubious move by black. The d4 pawn was adequately defended so now he loses material.
497,18,6,Be3,b'r1b1k2r/ppppnppp/4pq2/8/3NP3/2Q1B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I wanted to play Qxc7 but not while my knight is hanging on d4 undefended. Moving the knight loses a tempo and allows black to exchange queens. I would prefer the bishop on f4 or g5 but those squares are currently unavailable so this move lets me defend and develop and now threatens the c7 pawn.
498,18,7,1Bb5+,b'r1b1k2r/ppQ1nppp/3p1q2/1B2p3/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',My knight at d4 is in danger but I have better things to do right now than rescue it.
499,18,8,1Bxc6+,b'r1b1k2r/p1Q2ppp/2Bp1q2/4p3/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Ahh one of my favorite forks.

501,18,10,1Qg4,b'B6r/p4pkp/3p1q2/4p1p1/4P1Q1/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I could have saved the bishop by Qb7 or Qc6 but I was far enough ahead in material that I preferred to exchange queens even at the expense of my bishop. Black could prevent the exchange with 15. ... h6 but that allows my bishop to escape with 16 Bd4. 
502,18,11,1Qxg5+,b'r7/p4pkp/3p1q2/4p1Q1/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',The exchange is on.
503,18,12,1Bxg5,b'r7/p4pkp/3p4/4p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',And now white is out of steam for the moment but I'm ahead by a rook bishop and 2 pawns and both of black's rook pawns are isolated and look like fun targets.
504,18,13,1O-O-O,b'r7/5pk1/3p3p/p3p3/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',The fastest way to get my two rooks out onto the open file beginning with an attack against the backward pawn at d6.
505,18,14,2Rxd6,b'r7/5pk1/3R3p/4p3/p3P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - -',Black left it hanging so I see no reason not to gobble the pawn.
506,18,15,2Bxh6+,b'r7/5pk1/3R3B/4p3/4P3/p7/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - -',That pawn on a3 isn't going anywhere soon so there is no reason to break up a defensible pawn structure with bxa3. Time to gobble a little more material with a little zwischenzug.
507,18,16,2b3,b'r5k1/5p2/3R3B/4p3/4P3/pP6/P1P2PPP/2K4R b - -',22. Pxa3 gains no advantage but it breaks up my pawn structure and gives black's rook something to do. I prefer to maintain the status quo.
508,18,17,2Rhd1,b'r7/5p1k/3R3B/4p3/4P3/pP6/P1P2PPP/2KR4 b - -',Double D (my favorite of course!) - two rooks on the  open D file.
509,18,18,2g3,b'6r1/5p1k/3R3B/4p3/4P3/pP4P1/P1P2P1P/2KR4 b - -',No need to just give away my pawns.
510,18,19,2f3,b'8/5p1k/3R3B/4p3/4P1r1/pP3PP1/P1P4P/2KR4 b - -',Ditto.
511,18,20,2Rxg6,b'8/5p1k/6RB/4p3/4P3/pP3PP1/P1P4P/2KR4 b - -',Ahh black lets me trade off his only remaining piece.
512,18,21,2Bg5,b'8/7k/6p1/4p1B1/4P3/pP3PP1/P1P4P/2KR4 b - -',! I love this move. All of black's pawns are stymied and black's king has exactly 8 squares to play with. He cannot reach my bishop nor can he reach any of my pawns. He gets a lonely little 8-square prison cell to call home until I am ready to finish him off. 
513,18,22,2c4,b'8/6k1/6p1/4p1B1/2P1P3/pP3PP1/P6P/2KR4 b - c3',I don't think there is any way to force a mate with just a bishop and a rook. I could bring my king up but black's pawns would force me to use the d-file to get past the pawns letting black escape or letting him block me in with his own king. That could take a while. On the other hand I figured it was mate in 7 or less by simply pushing the c-pawn - black cannot pass the d-file so the pawn can march merrily to promotion unmolested.
514,18,23,3c6,b'8/8/2P1k1p1/4p1B1/4P3/pP3PP1/P6P/2KR4 b - -',Black's monarch wanders around his little 8-square prison and looks on helplessly at the inexorable progress of white's c-pawn.
515,18,24,3c8=Q,b'2Q5/6k1/6p1/4p1B1/4P3/pP3PP1/P6P/2KR4 b - -',Ahhh the pawn fulfills his wildest dream and now it's mate in 1.

A welcome end to a losing run of 5 games.  How did I do this well read on ........
518,19,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - pretty standard Sicilian stuff!
519,19,2,Qd2,b'rn1qk1nr/pp1bppbp/3p2p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',7. Qd2 - standard moves leading to a Yugoslav type attack.
520,19,3,b6,b'r2qk1nr/p2bppbp/1pnp2p1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',8. .......... b6 - unusual.
521,19,4,1Qxc3,b'r2qk1nr/4pp1p/ppbp2p1/8/2B1P3/2Q1BP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b kq -',12. Qxc3 - after developing Fou Leblanc to one of his best squares in the opening there is an exchange of knights.  My opponent now needs to do something about that cannon on h8 or it will be fodder for Glenda!  Black chooses to close off that diagonal with f6 but this move is about to allow a tactical shot as you will see.
522,19,5,Kf8,b'r2q1knr/4p2p/ppbp1pp1/8/2B1P3/1Q2BP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',13. .......... Kf8 - I could now go a pawn up with Q or B x b6 but aha the opposing king has moved onto the h6-f8 diagonal!  Aha there is a black steed on g8 which is defended by both black king and rook but I see a way to win at least the exchange.  First comes a removal of the guard with Bxg8.
523,19,6,Rxg8,b'r2q1kr1/4p2p/ppbp1pp1/8/4P3/1Q2BP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',14. ........ Rxg8 forced unless black wishes to drop a whole piece but look nothing now guards h6 so Fou Lenoir gleefully goes there.  Now if black moves his king to e8 then Qxg8  wins hands down as I will immediately exchange queens after nabbing that rook!
524,19,7,Rg7,b'r2q1k2/4p1rp/ppbp1ppB/8/4P3/1Q3P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',15. .......... Rg7 limits the damage to the exchange.
525,19,8,1h4,b'3q4/r3p1kp/ppbp1pp1/8/4P2P/1Q3P2/PPP3P1/2KRR3 b - h3',18. h4 - I start a vague plan of trying to prise open the black kingside and use my extra rook to then exploit this along with Glenda and the other rook.
526,19,9,b5,b'8/2qrp1kp/p1bp1pp1/1p6/4PP1P/5Q2/PPP3P1/2KRR3 w - -',20. ........... b5 - black tries some counterplay down the queenside.
527,19,10,2Qe3,b'8/3rp1kp/p1bp1pp1/q7/1p2PPPP/P3Q3/1PP5/2KRR3 b - -',23. Qe3 - Glenda moves out of the pin by the enemy lsb but keeps a careful eye on the pawn on b4 and the Wicked Witch of the West.  She is fully prepared to come on to the a file if necessary to neutralise the Witch's power on that file.
528,19,11,Kxf6,b'8/3rp2p/p2p1kp1/1q1b4/1p3PPP/P3Q3/1PP5/2KRR3 w - -',25. ......... Kxf6?? Suicide Suicide and double suicide!  Glenda is as pleased as punch to be relieved from defensive duties.  As the enemy bishop is only protected by the Witch then Glenda moving onto d4 is a double attack or fork.  As the king is in check black must deal with that and the lsb must be abandoned to his fate leaving my opponent a whole rook down.
529,19,12,2exd6,b'8/3r2kp/p2P2p1/3Q4/qp4PP/P7/1PP5/2KRR3 b - -',29. exd6 - I now clean up a few of black's pawns.
530,19,13,2bxa3,b'8/3r2kp/p2P2p1/3Q4/q5PP/p7/1PP5/2KRR3 w - -',29. ......... bxa3 - black tries some counterplay but to no avail as I now turn on my usual jstevens1 simplifying trick - forcing an exchange of queens as follows ......
531,19,14,3Kxb2,b'8/3r2kp/p2P2p1/8/3R2PP/8/1KP5/4R3 b - -',32. Kxb2 - I am now a whole rook up in a rook and pawn ending.  Beginners - here is how you clean up your opponent who opts not to wave the white flag!
532,19,15,Kf7,b'8/4Pk2/p5p1/7p/3R2PP/8/1KP5/8 w - -',34. ......... Kf7 - the final pair of rooks have been exchanged.  The black king tries to stop Glenda from making an appearance on e8 and indeed he does block it.  But never you fear he will soon be in a zugzswang .....
533,19,16,3c5,b'4k3/4P3/8/p1P4p/4R2P/8/1K6/8 b - -',38. c5 - isn't it nice to be spoilt for passers!  Zugzwang next move!
534,19,17,a3+,b'4k3/4P3/2P5/7p/4R2P/p7/1K6/8 w - -',39. ........a3  - Henry gleefully munches his prawn on toast as he surveys the squares c8 and e8.  Who knows he may end up with two wives!  Don't forget that Henry the Eighth had 6 the greedy so and so!  The black king must now move after Kxa3 and then ..............
535,19,18,4e8=Q+,b'4Q3/5k2/2P5/7p/4R2P/K7/8/8 b - -',41. e8/Q  - a joyous fanfare greets the arrival of Glenda the Defender in all her splendour!  Glenda does not have defense in mind here though!  She too is not above chasing other queen's kings!
536,19,19,4Re6,b'4Q3/6k1/2P1R3/7p/7P/K7/8/8 b - -',42. Re6 - thanks to her castle the deadly game of kiss chase does not last long.  The black king has only one legal move and that is to h7.  It is the castle that delivers the coup de grace on e8 and not Glenda though!  A happy ending for jstevens1!

539,20,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',And 2.c4 is my answer to 1....Nf6.

542,20,4,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',White tries to push pawns as more as he can.

I need some help cause I really want to understand when I ""started to lose"" the game. To me it seems from move 38. Let me know what you think.
Bye."
562,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Although I like strategical interesting games this game does not have that. Instead it contains an interaction between the white queen and the black king which lasts nine moves and leads to the demise of the black queen. It is not unlike a dance - hence the title - and not devoid of some beauty. 
563,21,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',My first try at the Bishop's Gambit variation of the King's Gambit Accepted.
564,21,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Already I have cold feet and I quickly try to get back to the Knight's Gambit (characterized by 3. Nf3 instead of 3. Bc4) of the KGA with which I am much more familiar.
565,21,3,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',This position is normally reached via 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Nc6 and black's 4-th move defines the Blachly Gambit (Blachly Defense would have been more appropriate). The stem game is Paulsen-Blachly New York 1857.
566,21,4,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2BPPpp1/2P2N2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The sacrifice of Nf3 is quite similar to the Muzio gambit and the goal is an attack over the f-file - the main strategical theme of the King's Gambit. A strong center is also of importance hence the support of d4 with c3.
567,21,5,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2BPPp2/2P2p2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The rook wants to be on the soon to be opened f-file. Note that the black pawn which comes on g2 forms a strong shield for the white king.
568,21,6,Bxf7+,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1B1p/2n5/8/3PPp2/2P5/PP4pP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"The last preparation to open the f-file similar to the so called ""Wild Muzio"". White gets this highway into the black position at the cost of a mere two minor pieces!


In his youth Steinitz loved attacking games. Here is a wonderful miniature where he dispatches his adversary with this opening:

569,21,7,Ke7,b'r1bq1bnr/ppppkB1p/2n5/8/3PPp2/2P5/PP4pP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Black declines to take the bait.
570,21,8,Rxf4,b'r1bq1bnr/ppppkB1p/2n5/8/3PPR2/2P5/PP4pP/RNBQ2K1 b - -',The rook - being under attack from g2 - has the honour of opening the f-file.
571,21,9,Bh6,b'r1bq2nr/ppppkB1p/2n4b/8/3PPR2/2P5/PP4pP/RNBQ2K1 w - -',Black develops and wants to trade material. That is often a good idea in the defense against this opening: White is in danger of running out of attacking pieces. For instance it takes quite a while before the white knight can join the raiding party (a disadvantage of 6. c3). 
572,21,10,Nf6,b'r1bq3r/ppppkB1p/2n2n2/8/3PP3/2P5/PP3RpP/RNQ3K1 w - -',After 11. ... d6 the black king is caught in a mating net starting with 12. Qg5 . And after 11. ... d5 the white queen has 12. Qg5  and 13. Qg7 snaring a piece without relinquishing the attack. So 11. .. Nf6 looks like the best defense.
573,21,11,1Bd5,b'r1bq3r/ppppk2p/2n2n2/3B4/3PP3/2P5/PP3RpP/RNQ3K1 b - -',12. Bd5 hoping for another shot at Qg5  if black is tempted to exchange more material. That would allow to get the black king in the open and in the reach of the reserves.
574,21,12,1Rf8,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk2p/2n2n2/3B4/3PP3/2P5/PP3RpP/RNQ3K1 w - -',Black again refuses the bait... At this point I am thinking that I will be lucky if I escape defeat with a perpetual. If black gets d7-d6 in it is over for white. This last point illustrates the importance of a single tempo in open games like this.
575,21,13,1e5,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk2p/2n2n2/3BP3/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RNQ3K1 b - -',Attempting to get the perpetual. 
576,21,14,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk2p/2n5/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RNQ3K1 w - -',This time black needs to accept the sacrifice of the white bishop as refusal loses.
577,21,15,1Qg5+,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk2p/2n5/3nP1Q1/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RN4K1 b - -',Finally the main theme of this annotated game: The royal dance is starting!! The black king can not go to e6 as then 15. Qg4 Ke7 16. Qg7  wins the black rook (and also the queen since the escape Qh4 leads to the fall of the black monarch). On 14. ... Nf6 there follows 15. exf6  and the black king is toast e.g. 15. .. Kf7 16. Qg7  Ke6 17. Re2  Kd5 18. Qg5  Kc4 19. b3  Kd3 20. Qd2#
578,21,16,1Qh5+,b'r1bqkr2/pppp3p/2n5/3nP2Q/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RN4K1 b - -',If the white queen could now have given check on g6 then Qg7  with attack on Rf8 would be possible. So here is the idea: Move the dance to the h-file eliminate h7 and then bring the dance back to the g-file.
579,21,17,1Qxh7+,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk2Q/2n5/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RN4K1 b - -',The first goal was easily obtained now we need to switch back to the g-file while keeping in contact with the black king.
580,21,18,1Qh3+,b'r1bq1r2/pppp4/2n1k3/3nP3/3P4/2P4Q/PP3RpP/RN4K1 b - -',A quick trot to h3

585,21,23,2Qg7+,b'r1bq1r2/ppppk1Q1/2n5/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP3RpP/RN4K1 b - -',Step. The end of the dance white now wins the black queen.
586,21,24,2Rxf8,b'r1bq1R2/pppp2Q1/2n1k3/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP4pP/RN4K1 b - -',The black queen has to give her life as her king is in a mating net.
587,21,25,2Qxf8,b'r1b2Q2/pppp4/2n1k3/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP4pP/RN4K1 b - -',Black's forces are virtually undeveloped white's reserves have lots of time to come into action.
588,21,26,2Nxe5,b'r1b2Q2/pppp4/4k3/3nn3/3P4/2P5/PP4pP/RN4K1 w - -',Deperation... The rest was played quickly and may not be the most efficient execution by the white forces. But it does not really matter anymore black is lost anyway.
589,21,27,Rf8,b'5r2/pbpp1k2/7Q/1p1nP3/8/2P5/PP1N2pP/4R1K1 w - -',Black is shooting for a last trick: Protect the g2 pawn by his bishop bring the rook to the f-file and hope that white leaves the backrank unprotected.
590,21,28,3Nf3,b'6r1/pbp2k2/4R2Q/1p1n4/8/2P2N2/PP4pP/6K1 b - -',White has activated his forces and opened the position with 29. e6 . I got the feeling there should be a fast win here but settled for exchanging of the rooks - killing any counter-threats.
591,21,29,3Qxg7,b'4k3/pbp3Q1/8/1p1nN3/8/2P5/PP4pP/6K1 b - -',After the exchange of the rooks the queen and her shepherd knight will corral the black king. The skills of queen and knight are complementary and they form a good team. 
592,21,30,4Qa7#,b'k7/Q7/2N5/2p5/8/2p5/PP4pP/6K1 b - -',Last embrace of the dance partners and curtains I hope you enjoyed the show.
593,22,0,f3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Oh I'm so proud of this one even if the finish was somewhat fortuitous!
594,22,1,Kf2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPPKPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',Thematic opening to this point.....
595,22,2,d5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bpp3/8/4PP2/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ1BNR w kq d6',I do play the Abdicatalan on occasion not overly used to attacking it though
596,22,3,cxd4,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/4b3/2bp4/3P4/4PP2/PP3KPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',At this stage white prob has the better development. I'm also concious that the Baron probably remembers some comments I made on another annotation and is gunning for me big style *grins*
597,22,4,Ne7,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1nppp/3bb3/3p4/3P4/2N1PP2/PP3KPP/R1BQ1BNR w kq -',So I play for space rather than time letting him have the tempo but forcing him to do the work.
598,22,5,Bh3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2nppp/3bb3/2pp4/3P4/2N1PPPB/PP3K1P/R1BQ2NR b kq -',I thought here about bxb but the counter take is obvious so I thought why should I help him develop. Chose deliberately to semi open the f file instead.
599,22,6,Nbc6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2n1pp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P4/2N1PPPN/PP3K1P/R1BQ3R w - -',Although this looks like an attacking move I'm still trying to play defensive (I'm just not very good at it)
600,22,7,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2n1pp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P1P2/2N1P1PN/PP3K1P/R1BQ3R b - -',That was a surprise to me I expected him to do summat about the d pawn.

Worried me initially but the more I looked at it the more that seemed like a mistake. The only place the knight can go is back unless he wants to sac it.
616,22,23,2Nc3,b'3r2k1/1p4pp/pbn2qr1/3p4/1P1PpP2/P1N1K1P1/4QN1P/R2R4 b - -',Now here is the crux. Have I got enough to crash through the middle. On paper yes. However despite the disparity in ratings I know Barons a better player than I...so what trick has he got prepared?

Black could have saved the knight and my discovered check would have only netted me a pawn. Maybe it was an oversight since we were playing so fast. There seems to be no reprisal so I eat the knight.
626,23,7,1Nf3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1q2/8/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Thinking that if black exchanges he can pin and win my e5 pawn by playing a rook to e8. I was afraid of him skewering my queen to my king with Re8 but e8 is not guarded so right now I would reply with Qxe8 and win the rook. But I have to alleviate this danger very quickly.
627,23,8,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1q2/8/3PQ3/2P2N1b/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Of course 11. Pxh3 loses my queen (I could save her by 12. Ne5 and maybe only lose the knight but even that sets up scary discovered attacks). So I ignore the bishop and castle to protect my queen and my g2 pawn. Black has two bishops and queen in striking range of my castled position which worried me but I didn't see any attacks that could overcome the defense offered by my queen and knight.
628,23,9,1Kxg2,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1q2/8/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PKP/RNB2R2 b - -',Black sacrifices to open up the castled formation but again I don't see an attack that can justify the sacrifice so I take the free bishop.
629,23,10,1Qh4,b'4rrk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1q2/8/3P3Q/2P2N2/PP3PKP/RNB2R2 b - -',The rook move was expected though I thought it would be the rook on f8 that would attack my queen. My reply offers to trade his most dangerous piece and liquidate toward an easy endgame.
630,23,11,1Nxh4,b'4rrk1/ppp2ppp/2pb4/8/3P3N/2P5/PP3PKP/RNB2R2 b - -',He accepted my offer and now my King is safe and and white is ahead by two pieces for a pawn.
631,23,12,1Be3,b'5rk1/ppp2ppp/2pbr3/8/3P3N/2P1B3/PP3PKP/RN3R2 b - -',Shutting down the open e-file that black is more likely to dominate with his better development and also defending my f2 pawn since I am expecting to move my rook out from behind the pawn and don't want it to become a target for black.
632,23,13,1Nd2,b'5rk1/ppp2pp1/2pbr2p/8/3P3N/2P1B3/PP1N1PKP/R4R2 b - -',Not my best move. I'm still playing quite fast here and I wanted to catch up in development. Better was 16. Nf5! which exchanges my weak knight for black's strong bishop. I am also looking at Rg8 and Bxh6 (I have to clear away black's rook from the 6th rank first).
633,23,14,1Rfg1,b'5rk1/ppp1bpp1/2p1r2p/8/3P3N/2P1B3/PP1N1PKP/R5R1 b - -',Bad move. I wanted to get my king back into some shelter with Kf1 and I wanted to take the half-open file aimed at black's king. Playing fast I completely overlooked my hanging knight allowing black to almost equalize.
634,23,15,1Rae1,b'5rk1/ppp2pp1/2p1r2p/8/3P3b/2P1B3/PP1N1PKP/4R1R1 b - -',Well on the plus side after my blunder I'm still slightly ahead thanks to black's questionable sacrifice on his 11th move. We have both given away a free knight this game. Time to be more careful. However we're both still playing rapidly. With this move I chllenge black on the open e file.
635,23,16,1Kh3,b'5rk1/ppp2pp1/2p3rp/8/3P3b/2P1B2K/PP1N1P1P/4R1R1 b - -',By attacking the bishop I force an exchange of rooks or an exchange of bishops. I'm hoping my tiny material advantage can be exploited to produce a bigger advantage and liquidiating pieces seems the best approach here.
636,23,17,2Nf3,b'5rk1/ppp2p2/2p4p/6p1/3P3b/2P1BN1K/PP3P1P/6R1 b - -',An odd choice by black trapping his bishop on h4 with nowhere to run. His pawn on g5 cannot recapture because it is pinned. Now black must lose a pawn.
637,23,18,2Kxh4,b'5r2/ppp2p1k/2p4p/8/3P3K/2P1B3/PP3P1P/6R1 b - -',OK now I'm back to a suitable lead especially since there is no way for black to save his c7 pawn from my bishop and rook.
638,23,19,2Re2,b'6r1/ppp2p1k/2p4p/8/3P3K/2P1B3/PP2RP1P/8 b - -',To protect the f2 pawn while remaining on the open e-file. Black has no good attacks from the g-file.
639,23,20,2Bf4,b'6r1/p1p2p1k/1pp4p/8/3P1B1K/2P5/PP2RP1P/8 b - -',Black seems to be preparing to advance to c5 but isolating his doubled pawns on the c-file won't help him and capturing with Pxd4 just leaves white with a passed pawn after white recaptures with Pxd4 (this assumes white is able to play Bxc7 which black cannot really prevent).
640,23,21,2Re7+,b'6r1/p1p1R2k/1pp4p/5p2/3P1B1K/2P5/PP3P1P/8 b - -',Black wanted to play Rg4  and win white's bishop. I'm not too keen on letting that happen. I see my chance to get a rook on the 7th so I take it. Black only has one response to 27. Re7 .
641,23,22,2Be5+,b'6rk/p1p1R3/1pp4p/4Bp2/3P3K/2P5/PP3P1P/8 b - -',Well OK black had two responses but I never thought he would willing walk into checkmate (even not seeing the mate cornering the king and immediately losing the rook should have been two warning signs). Black's kh8 move gives white a checkmate in 5: 28. Be5  Rb7 (forced) 29. Rxg7 (any) 30. Kh5 (any) 31. Kxh6 (any) 32. Rf6  .

Pawn structure - I'm ahead. He has three pawn islands and doubled pawns

Officers - I'm ahead; my bishops are in better position (though only until he plays a3).
Development - even
King safety - even

Either way Black gets a very strong attack and both sides tend to forego castling.  If White plays well he gets good counter-chances.  I've just resigned a team game against robbyzzz where I lost this line...

I'd like to block the Q's view down the a7-g1 diagonal with my B but first I have to protect e3 with my Q.  To do this without interfering with my other B I must first develop the KB then move my Q to e2.  Developing the KB to d3 also ensures that a black N coming to f5 to attack e3 can be swapped off giving Black doubled pawns to match White's own.

Not sure it quite deserves a full !; but I like this move as it defends the b4 pawn so that I can advance the c-pawns.

I pretty much had to trade queens as the white queen threatens both of my knights and I have no move that saves them both. Obviously after white recaptures that knight will be forking two undefended pawns. I squirmed quite a bit here before committing to trading queens (if I had to lose a pawn I would want my queen around - no need exchanging queens when I'm behind in matrial or about to fall behind). Then I found the way out.

However the pawn at b3 is hanging and cannot be saved. If 29. Nc8? Re8  wins the knight. Oh and I'm very conscious of the threat of Nd7 which fortunately white cannot reach for several moves.

Now the position looks fairly drawish. I'm up by a full piece but K B vs. K is a draw so I have to use my material advantage to win a pawn and there's precious few of them left and they're well positioned. 
823,32,23,Ra2,b'R4bk1/2N2p1p/6p1/8/1n3P2/6K1/r5PP/8 w - -',I'm thinking liquidate the rooks if white will oblige then liquidate the knights if at all possible then eventually find a way to sacrifice my extra piece to eliminate a white pawn in such a way that my 3 vs. 2 pawn ending will be favorable. I expect white to avoid this eventuality.
824,32,24,Rxa8,b'r4bk1/2N2p1p/6p1/8/1n3P1P/6K1/6P1/8 w - -',White proved me wrong and it proved to be his undoing. Here I was expecting a long difficult endgame threatening to draw if I'm not careful and maybe even draw if I am careful. Then white commits a game-ending blunder with 35. h4??. Now after 36. Nxa8 black plays 36. ... Nd5! leaving white's knight trapped in the corner with no moves. White can try to dislodge black's knight with his king starting with 37. Kf3 but 37. ... f5! blocks white's king's route and gives the black king time to support the knight. Then maneuver the black bishop to d8 and hunt the white knight with the black king and black will be up by two pieces instead of one. Apparently black foresaw this too (one move too late) and resigned.

Maybe I would be better off just marching my king over to d1 so I can play Rc1 but then black has an all you can eat pawn buffet with my king-side pawns and I still couldn't promote my c-pawn due to black's Bxc8 after I promote.

Black attempts to entice White's pawns forward and weaken them while doing so. I chose the French Defence in Round 2 and I wanted a change so I went for this defence.
943,38,2,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The only feasible square for the knight. After 2...Ne4? it is being kicked around the board.
944,38,3,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This is generally considered inferior to 3.d4 as consolidating White's pawn formation is preferred to attacking Black's knight once again. Often 3.d4 d6 and THEN 4.c4 as White's central pawn formation has been strengthened.
945,38,4,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A common move in Alekhine's Defence challenging White's advanced e-pawn.
946,38,5,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',This position has more or less transposed into the Four Pawns Attack of Alekhine's Defence after 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4. White is trying to maintain his e-pawn in the centre.
947,38,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4P3/2PP4/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black proceeds with his plan. The White's hopefully over-extended central pawns can now be undermined by cunning long-range bombardment from Black's knights.
948,38,7,Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4P3/2PP4/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White starts committing pieces to his pawns' defence - all part of Black's plan of course :-).
949,38,8,Bf5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4Pb2/2PP4/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Perhaps 7...Be6 attacking White's impertinent c-pawn would have been stronger but I decided against it as it has less freedom on e6 and blocks Black's e-pawn.
950,38,9,a3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/4Pb2/2PP4/P1N1B3/1P4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Restraining Black's dark-squared bishop.
951,38,10,Bg5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/4Pbb1/2PP4/P1NBB3/1P4PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',"This was the last move in GameKnot's database. ""From now on"" I told myself grimly""I'm on my own."" But I saw some interesting opportunities after the light-squared bishops are exchanged off and I might be able to pick off White's c-pawn."
952,38,11,1Bxf5,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/4PBq1/2PP4/P1N5/1P4PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Here I considered 12...Qxg2 but I decided against it in favour of the less risky option.
953,38,12,1exf5,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4Ppq1/2PP4/P1N5/1P4PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Off go all the bishops.
954,38,13,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4Ppq1/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P4PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Curses! He has spotted my cunning plan!
955,38,14,Qxb2,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4Pp2/2PP4/P1N2N2/1q5P/R2QK1R1 w Qkq -',I can still pick off pawns where I can though.
956,38,15,1c5,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/1NP1Pp2/3P4/P4N2/1q5P/R2QK1R1 b Q -',Loses him another pawn.
957,38,16,Qxh2+,b'2k4r/pppr1pRp/8/n2PPpN1/8/P7/4K2q/R2Q4 w - -',I thought of simplifying by exchanging queens but decided in favour of the extra pawn. Besides if I had exchanged queens the following fork would not have happened.
958,38,17,Qxe5+,b'2k4r/pppr1pRp/8/n2PqpN1/8/P7/8/R2QK3 w - -',Faced with the loss of the rook as well as four pawns White resigns. It's 2-1 to me phishbone6984...better luck next time...
959,39,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Russian game aka Petroff Defence - A drawish tools employed and popularized by Former world champion GM Kramnik during his reign. Although it look symmetrical but done be fool by it as it is lethal as any other opening which is rich on theory. 
960,39,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"5. Nc3!? This move is debaticle as an attacking move. After 5. ... Nxc3 6. dxc3 white bishops has greater attacking combo. Some of notable wielder include Michael Adam.
