Black has to play this double edged move if he hopes to get in ...f5. Reason being is that they have to deflect my f-knight away from contesting g5 so that ...f5 can be played without worrying about the weakness created on g5. Even so the holes on black's king side begin to show signs of fatigue.

A very awkward moment for me. I am forced to retreat the knight back to c3 and allow black greater share of the centre. Not to mention deflecting a piece away from the defense of f2.

I give this a brilliance because the reason for it is obvious and subtle. The king is taking matters of his own safety into his hands by walking himself to g1. Castling is out because then black would be able to take on h6 with a guaranteed draw.  I would say that black is doing OK but the picture is starting to become very complex for him. Even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but I was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file. I also felt that I had to keep the h6-pawn because it was controlling the critical mating square of g7.

The knight returns! This move is what makes 18.Kf1 work. Black does not have a discover check because of fork on his queen. Thus black will have to retreat the queen and allow white to regain the material. Still the wide open f-file dominated by the black rook keeps black in the game.

He was intent upon the 1.e4 2.Nf3 3.Bb5 sequence almost regardless of what Black played.""  That is absolutely the case.  The idea being is to experiment by playing the same type of variations that you would see in completely different openings and defenses.  Afterall the same expert ionadowman added this statement ""Back in schoolboy days I liked the Queen's Gambit openings in which I would play 1.d4 2.c4. 3.Nc3 4.Nf3 5.Bg5. Then I encountered people playing the King's Indian (1...Nf6) and had no idea what to do against it. So I simply played the 5 move sequence I knew.

But why not 6...e5 that was better and would have done the same ""and then some"".  In addition it would attack d N forcing a retreat while he would be able to make a developing move.  This move however is an inaccuracy and nearly a mistake because he's blocking his own LSB so that he'll either have to cram his position with ...Bd7 later on or waste time to get it out."

Meanwhile I am still determined to continue developing by getting another piece out since you generally want to do this ASAP.  At first I wasn't crazy about this because like Erika's (reachforgold's) game against me my LSB right near a central square which you generally need to control the center.  And it's usually not a good idea to block this area since it's important to control the center.  This one piece can get in the way.  But when I first told Mr. Stockel about stating that I didn't like it he said ""That's a good move.""  And that's the very reason that I marked it with an exclamation point."
46,2,5,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',In this position black moved here to fork my b P a d N and this is why my coach brought his Q out before developing the other pieces.  Now I can describe it as a forking move since it does not involve a N.  However he is attempting a cheapo tactic which I should have seen.  
47,2,6,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/6B1/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',? Of course I am not going let black win my N but this is my first mistake.

Of course he was probably thinking that I would either exchange when I'm already behind make a move that would ultimately lose castling rights with 10.Kf1 but none of that was going to happen.  Having said that all of that I also could have punished him with 10.Bd2 but that would cram my Q and delay center control which I don't want to do.  As it turns out my center is pretty much controlled since I control a lot of center squares.  So why undo something when it's not necessary?

Here's the thing as already know Tom comes a little later but has to leave earlier then everyonelse.  And there are only two chess boards and Jack like to play two people.  In addition he was in the middle of a game with Ted his other student Therefore Mr. Stockel told me that he wanted to end the game immediately so that Tom can play before he has to leave.  He will either play Jack or me.  In addition my opponent is still a little behind which gives white an advantage.  So black decided to let white keep the advantage  and that's the logic behind 14...Qg4??.  Now had it not been for this circumstance black would have escaped with 14...Qa5.

So no doubt you have all been wondering just where Henry and Glenda have got to and had no doubt thought you had seen the back of Old Matey.  Well it's just that I have been soooo busy lately with my huge games workload which is gradually diminishing and other things.  However here I am again.  This time after 3 losses against Davide I managed to open my account against him with a Low Draw.  I think it is a pretty rare endgame though.  Even though at the end I was a pawn down I managed to draw it because it was a side pawn and my opponent had the wrong colour bishop.  So how did this happen?  Well read on ........"

As the kingside looks undisturbed I think he should go there although I must keep my eye on the Wicked Witch of the West who has plonked herself on c2 and is eyeing up h7 which is another fav. square for Old Matey to reside on.

However it really is fortunate that Henry despite being in his sixties is still pretty agile and will manage to make a frantic dash to h8 in time.  Even if my knight falls white cannot win because he has the wrong coloured bishop!

108,4,25,Kh8,b'7k/8/3n2BK/8/7P/8/8/8 w - -',50. ..... Kg8 - MADE IT!  WHEEEW AND DOUBLE WHEEEW!  After Henry is safely ensconced on h8 he bends over and puts his hands on his knees just like we girls were taught to do in our PE lessons after going for a 400m jog round the athletics track at school!  There is no way Davide can crown that h pawn even if I lost my knight because his bishop does not command h8 the best he can achieve is the wrong kind of mate.  Ho hum - even though my rating has dropped a further 3.5 points at least I can take heart from the fact that being 3.5 - 0.5 down looks a little better than 3-0 down and is quite an improvement on my 3 other games with him!  Anyhow tomorrow is another day ........ so goodnight for now folks!

The lines with 3...Nf6 historically are also problematic vfor White.  The long time KG player is not likely to worry too much about a refutation in a rarely seen line....just toss in a piece sacrifice and move on!  Now if everyone starts playing 3...Nc6....
173,7,3,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',"Bad move number one...A.) Blocks the d=pawn which traps the Queen Bishop unless the slow fianchetto is employed. B.) The Bishop does not really protect the gambit pawn capturer on f4. C.) The Bishop is exposed to pawn attacks and the resulted loss of tempi. Better are 3...Qh4+ 3...Nf6 3...d5 and supposedly 3...Nc6.  Also the

262,9,32,2Rd6,b'rn3rk1/1b1p2p1/p2Rp2p/1p4P1/4pPBP/1Nn1B3/P1P5/2K2R2 b - -',A good square for the d-rook which had to move. If white wants to stay in this he has got to put pressure on black's remaining army.
263,9,33,2Nxa2+,b'rn3rk1/1b1p2p1/p2Rp2p/1p4P1/4pPBP/1N2B3/n1P5/2K2R2 w - -',?! A little weak. How can winning a pawn with check be weak? Black's advantage is material only; his pieces are uncoordinated and his pawn structure is a mess. This not only fails to address that it moves the knight farther away from where the action is taking place.
264,9,34,2Kb2,b'rn3rk1/1b1p2p1/p2Rp2p/1p4P1/4pPBP/1N2B3/nKP5/5R2 b - -',Tempoing the knight and taking away the c3 square.
265,9,35,2Nb4,b'rn3rk1/1b1p2p1/p2Rp2p/1p4P1/1n2pPBP/1N2B3/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Forced.
266,9,36,2Nc5,b'rn3rk1/1b1p2p1/p2Rp2p/1pN3P1/1n2pPBP/4B3/1KP5/5R2 b - -',"Here's the thing about chess when you're down-but-not-out yet: you're not going to get anywhere making the ""objectively best"" move most of the time. You've got to put pressure on your opponent and make it easy for him to make a mistake!"
267,9,37,2Bc6,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRp2p/1pN3P1/1n2pPBP/4B3/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Saving the bishop while also protecting d7.
268,9,38,2Bd4,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRp2p/1pN3P1/1n1BpPBP/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',An easy move to make but not necessarily the best; gxh5 offered a number of good threats too. But it's important to remember that black has a lot of threats of his own most of which take the form of exchanging pieces to a won endgame! My goal is to prevent that and drum up threats against his king and pieces!
269,9,39,2hxg5,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRp3/1pN3p1/1n1BpPBP/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',?! A weakening move although I can understand the desire to prevent gxh6 which was tempting last move. h5 looked better.
270,9,40,2hxg5,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRp3/1pN3P1/1n1BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',Of course not fxg5; I liked this recapture for opening the h-file with two rooks and two bishops on. What I didn't see however was 25. Nxe6! which leaves white with a great attack after either dxe6 26. Bxe6+ (and black faces huge problems after the king moves to the h-file) or R-moves followed by 26. Nxg5 and at least equality.
271,9,41,2Nd5,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRp3/1pNn2P1/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',? This move looks good on the surface as it threatens a variety of things: the pawn on f4 to advance e4-e3 maybe to even play Nb6 with an eye to Nc4+ forking the rook. But white now has a sacrifice of his own that wins the Nd5 and turns the tables: 26. Nxd7 Bxd7 (not Nxd7 27. Bxe6+) 27. Rxd7! Nxd7 28. Bxe6+ and white's attack is tremendous.
272,9,42,2Nxe6,b'rn3rk1/3p2p1/p1bRN3/1p1n2P1/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',?! The wrong pawn! This improves white's situation over what it was a few moves ago but is a much weaker move than Nxd7.
273,9,43,2Rf7,b'rn4k1/3p1rp1/p1bRN3/1p1n2P1/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Much better than dxe6 27. Bxe6+ but after all the carnage _this_ position is roughly equal.
274,9,44,2g6,b'rn4k1/3p1rp1/p1bRN1P1/1p1n4/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',This was a hard move to find but I like it a lot. The rook must move (and e7 is the only safe square) and this really hems in the black king.
275,9,45,2Re7,b'rn4k1/3pr1p1/p1bRN1P1/1p1n4/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Forced.
276,9,46,2Nd8,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/p1bR2P1/1p1n4/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',Threatening 29. Nxc6 which will either run into Nxc6 30. Rxd5 winning a piece or dxc6 30. Rd8+ Re8 31. Rxe8#.
277,9,47,2a5,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/2bR2P1/pp1n4/3BpPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Nothing better as there's no way to move the Nb8 and free the Ra8 to roam the 8th rank.
278,9,48,2Bc5,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/2bR2P1/ppBn4/4pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',?! Getting cute and going for an extra threat on the Re7 when simply Nxc6 gives white a winning edge.
279,9,49,2b4,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/2bR2P1/p1Bn4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',?? Na6 was the saving move as Nxc6 could be met with Nxc5! re-defending the d7 square in the process.
280,9,50,3Rxd5,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/2b3P1/p1BR4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',?! Missing Nxc6 which -- with the white pawn on g6 -- would now win easily! 30. Nxc6 Nxc6 (not dxc6 31. Rd8 and mate to follow) 31. Rxd5 and black needs to drop the Re7 for a bishop to avoid going down even further. Rxd5 is still solid as it wins a knight and rook for a rook but there's still a lot of chess left now.
281,9,51,3Bxd5,b'rn1N2k1/3pr1p1/6P1/p1Bb4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',The only move.
282,9,52,3Bxe7,b'rn1N2k1/3pB1p1/6P1/p2b4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',Also the only move.
283,9,53,3Nc6,b'r2N2k1/3pB1p1/2n3P1/p2b4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Pretty much forcing the exchange of knights.
284,9,54,dxc6,b'r5k1/4B1p1/2p3P1/p2b4/1p2pPB1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Okay let's take stock now. White is up a bishop for two pawns has a slightly more aggressive position and black's king is a little vulnerable. On the other hand black has some aggressive pawns and a little firepower too. Having escaped a losing position we turn to winning a won game which is full of challenges!
285,9,55,3f5,b'r5k1/4B1p1/2p3P1/p2b1P2/1p2p1B1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',I'd love to play Be6+ but black's Bd5 prevents that so I have thoughts of trying to turn my kingside pawn edge into a new queen.
286,9,56,3Re8,b'4r1k1/4B1p1/2p3P1/p2b1P2/1p2p1B1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',A good move supporting an e-pawn push and hitting the bishop.
287,9,57,3f6,b'4r1k1/4B1p1/2p2PP1/p2b4/1p2p1B1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',I like this move even if the computer analysis doesn't; this makes it hard for black to do any counterattacking.
288,9,58,3gxf6,b'4r1k1/4B3/2p2pP1/p2b4/1p2p1B1/8/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Best.
289,9,59,3Bxf6,b'4r1k1/8/2p2BP1/p2b4/1p2p1B1/8/1KP5/5R2 b - -',All of a sudden there's the threat of Rh1 followed by Rh8#!
290,9,60,3e3,b'4r1k1/8/2p2BP1/p2b4/1p4B1/4p3/1KP5/5R2 w - -',Stymying that threat but this doesn't really solve black's problems.
291,9,61,3Rf5,b'4r1k1/8/2p2BP1/p2b1R2/1p4B1/4p3/1KP5/8 b - -',Now the threat is Rh5 followed by Rh8#.
292,9,62,3Be4,b'4r1k1/8/2p2BP1/p4R2/1p2b1B1/4p3/1KP5/8 w - -',Of course not pushing for the queen which gets black checkmated but this is the final mistake and allows white to win in a more roundabout way.
293,9,63,3Re5,b'4r1k1/8/2p2BP1/p3R3/1p2b1B1/4p3/1KP5/8 b - -',Okay look. I appreciate that there's more than one way to win a won game and that to many that means to look for the win that happens in the least number of moves. (The computer prefers Rg6 here.) But here's the thing this move is best for me for two reasons: 1.) It forces the rooks off the board (or white wins the bishop) and 2.) that simplifies to an endgame where ***I see the win***.
294,9,64,3Rxe5,b'6k1/8/2p2BP1/p3r3/1p2b1B1/4p3/1KP5/8 w - -',Best.
295,9,65,3Bxe5,b'6k1/8/2p3P1/p3B3/1p2b1B1/4p3/1KP5/8 b - -',This is what I was hoping for. Can you see what's going to happen?
296,9,66,3Bxg6,b'6k1/8/2p3b1/p3B3/1p4B1/4p3/1KP5/8 w - -',Yes black is going to play Bxg6 with temporary material equality. But the e-pawn will fall in two moves and black's other pawns are too far away from his king to save. The best he can do is wind up in a K+B+P vs. K+P endgame or a K+2B vs K endgame both wins for white.
297,9,67,3Bd4,b'6k1/8/2p3b1/p7/1p1B2B1/4p3/1KP5/8 b - -',There is no saving the e-pawn.
298,9,68,3a4,b'6k1/8/2p3b1/8/pp1B2B1/4p3/1KP5/8 w - -',Pushing his own pawns in hopes of queening one or causing a white mistake.
299,9,69,4Be6+,b'6k1/8/2p1B1b1/8/pp1B4/4p3/1KP5/8 b - -',I like this in-between move. White _could_ just play Bxe3 but this puts a wet blanket on black's queening ambitions.
300,9,70,4Kh7,b'8/7k/2p1B1b1/8/pp1B4/4p3/1KP5/8 w - -',There is no good move here.
301,9,71,4Bxe3,b'8/7k/2p1B1b1/8/pp6/4B3/1KP5/8 b - -',Now.
302,9,72,4a3+,b'8/7k/2p1B1b1/8/1p6/p3B3/1KP5/8 w - -',Trappy. Making white fight for it. Note that b3 doesn't get white's c-pawn off the board; white plays c3 followed by Ka3 Bc1 and winning both pawns for nothing.
303,9,73,4Kb1,b'8/7k/2p1B1b1/8/1p6/p3B3/2P5/1K6 b - -',! Smart. Of course not 42. Ka2 (Bxc2) but also not 42. Kb3 as a2! creates headaches for white.
304,9,74,4Bxc2+,b'8/7k/2p1B3/8/1p6/p3B3/2b5/1K6 w - -',I was shocked to see this but there's no good answer to the threat of Bc5 followed by the cleanup of the black pawns. This leads to an instructive two bishop endgame.
305,9,75,4Bc4,b'8/8/2p2k2/8/1pB5/pK2B3/8/8 b - -',Step 1: clean up black's remaining pawns to shut down any shenanigans.
306,9,76,4Kxb4,b'8/8/2p5/4k3/1KB5/p3B3/8/8 b - -',1 down 2 to go.
307,9,77,4Bc5,b'8/8/2p5/2B5/1KB1k3/p7/8/8 b - -',This is the most powerful part about two bishops in the endgame: they create a wall one space in front of them and two impassable diagonal walls. The king is stuck and can mount no threats.
308,9,78,4Bxa2,b'8/8/2p5/2B5/1K2k3/8/B7/8 b - -',Two down one to go.
309,9,79,4Bd4,b'8/8/2p5/8/1K1B1k2/8/B7/8 b - -',It's faster to get the bishop out of the way and just get there with the king.
310,9,80,Kf5,b'8/8/2p5/2K2k2/3B4/8/B7/8 w - -',Kd3 -- with an eye to taking the d4 bishop if Kxc6 -- is best met by Bb1+ forcing the king away from both bishops.
311,9,81,5Kxc6,b'8/8/2K5/5k2/3B4/8/B7/8 b - -',Three down. Time for Step 2: to corral the black king and force him to one side of the board.
312,9,82,5Bb1+,b'8/8/8/2K5/3B4/3k4/8/1B6 b - -',This forces the king off the third rank and nearer to the rim.
313,9,83,5Be4,b'8/8/8/2K5/3BB3/8/4k3/8 b - -',And this will keep him there. Note how he can only move between d2 and e2 without backing up even farther.
314,9,84,5Kc4,b'8/8/8/8/2KBB3/8/3k4/8 b - -',Bringing the king in is essential.
315,9,85,5Kc3,b'8/8/8/8/3BB3/2K5/4k3/8 b - -',And by taking away d2 black is forced onto the rim.
316,9,86,5Kf1,b'8/8/8/8/3BB3/2K5/8/5k2 w - -',Now that he's chosen a square the key will be keeping him there.
317,9,87,5Bf3,b'8/8/8/8/3B4/2K2B2/8/5k2 b - -',Taking away e2. Note that Kd2 here would have resulted in stalemate; it's important to be careful!
318,9,88,5Be3,b'8/8/8/8/8/2K1BB2/8/4k3 b - -',"This is the key position to setting up Step 3: checkmate in the corner. Black is caught between e1 and f1 making the kingside the ""weak side"" and the queenside the ""strong side"". To finish the mate I'll have to move my king to the weak side where it will cut off the black king's escape."
319,9,89,5Kd3,b'8/8/8/8/8/3KBB2/8/5k2 b - -',And I've got all the time in the world to do it.
320,9,90,Kf1,b'8/8/8/8/8/4BBK1/8/5k2 w - -',Now the last part begins: forcing the black king into the corner which here means freeing up g1 and taking away e1.
321,9,91,Kg1,b'8/8/8/8/8/5BK1/3B4/6k1 w - -',And now to force him to h1.
322,9,92,6Kh3,b'8/8/8/8/8/7K/3BB3/7k b - -',"This ""extra"" move is vital! Note how a premature Be3 here would result in stalemate."
323,9,93,6Kg1,b'8/8/8/8/8/7K/3BB3/6k1 w - -',Forced.
324,9,94,6Be3+,b'8/8/8/8/8/4B2K/4B3/6k1 b - -',Black resigns. At last victory is here; the finale is 66... Kh1 67. Bf3#. The computer's only complaint is that when I played 53. Bb1+ -- mating 13 moves later -- I could've gotten there 3 moves faster by playing Kd5. A win is a win and that's how you do it with two bishops in the endgame!
325,10,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So we start off with a common queen's pawn opening.
326,10,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Far more common is 2. c4 but it can still transpose.
327,10,2,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',So my opponent chose to play the London System. I will admit that I had not prepared for this opening at all. So I just played moves that were natural and followed opening principles.
328,10,3,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',!? 3. c5 is considered the main line. This response is slightly more passive but it is still O.K.
329,10,4,Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This position is quite unusual. However both sides seem to have decent chances.
330,10,5,Bb4,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/1bPP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',?! This is an inaccuracy that gives white the initiative. 
331,10,6,Qb3,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/1bPP1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I had overlooked this move. The bishop can not move because it is pinned to the b pawn. 
332,10,7,Qe7,b'rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/1bPP1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',? Best probably would have been to exchange immediately. Now I must be very careful with my next few moves.
333,10,8,c5,b'rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/2Pp1b2/1b1P1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',! Cutting off the bishop from the queen's protection. This move also opens up the threat of Bd6 which would prevent me from castling and making my position cramped.
334,10,9,Ne4,b'rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1p3/2Pp1b2/3PnB2/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This is practically force to keep the bishop off of d6.
335,10,10,1Bd6,b'rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2pBp3/2Pp1b2/3Pn3/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',!? Interesting. White will seize a strong initiative but I can create a counter attack quite easily. White will have a difficult time defending that d pawn. However it certainly can cause some problems in the future...
336,10,11,1Ne5,b'rn2k2r/pp1q1ppp/2pPp3/3pNb2/3P4/1QP1P3/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',White gains another tempo but now I will start to really pressure white.
337,10,12,1Be2,b'rnq1k2r/pp3ppp/2pPp3/3pNb2/3P4/1QP1P3/P3BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I think 13. c4 might have been a slightly better alternative.
338,10,13,1Nd7,b'r1q1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pPp3/3pNb2/3P4/1QP1P3/P3BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Putting some pressure on the knight.
339,10,14,1c4,b'r1q2rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pPp3/3pNb2/2PP4/1Q2P3/P3BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',With the intentions of playing c5 at some point to protect the d6 pawn or cxd5 to open the c file.
340,10,15,1Nxe5,b'r1q2rk1/pp3ppp/2pPp3/3pnb2/2PP4/1Q2P3/P3BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Exchanging for white's powerful knight.
341,10,16,f6,b'r1q2rk1/pp4pp/2pPpp2/3pPb2/2P5/1Q2P3/P3BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',My plan was quite simple at this point. Open the f file get my queen to g6 to attack white's king and try to isolate the d6 pawn.
342,10,17,Rb8,b'1rq2rk1/pp4pp/2pPpp2/3pPb2/2P2P2/1Q2P3/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Further defending the b pawn and preparing to play Qe8.
343,10,18,1a4,b'1r2qrk1/pp4pp/2pPpp2/3pPb2/P1P2P2/1Q2P3/4B1PP/2R2RK1 b - a3',?! I don't really know what the purpose of this move is. Perhaps cxd5 or maybe even Qd1!? was worth considering.
344,10,19,1fxe5,b'1r2qrk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/3ppb2/P1P2P2/1Q2P3/4B1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Opening the f file for my rook as well as creating a weakness on e5 for white.
345,10,20,Qg6,b'1r3rk1/pp4pp/2pPp1q1/3pPb2/P1P5/1Q2P3/4B1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Now that my plan has come to fruition I have a comfortable position. I am now threatening Be4 with a decisive advantage. As far as I can see white has only two good options. Either Bf3 (probably best) or a more aggressive Rf3. 
346,10,21,2Rf3,b'1r3rk1/pp4pp/2pPp1q1/3pPb2/P1P5/1Q2PR2/4B1PP/2R3K1 b - -',And the more aggressive approach is what white chose.
347,10,22,2Rg3,b'1r3rk1/pp4pp/2pPp1q1/3pP3/P1P1b3/1Q2P1R1/4B1PP/2R3K1 b - -',This drops the e5 pawn however there is not much else white could really do about the threat of mate.
348,10,23,2Bf3,b'1r3rk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/3pPq2/P1P1b3/1Q2PBR1/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',This move is basically forced to prevent the queen and rook battery. Now I am up a pawn but I must still be careful.
349,10,24,2Bxf3,b'1r3rk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/3pPq2/P1P5/1Q2PbR1/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',?! This is not best. The immediate Qxe5 was probably better leaving white to decide whether to exchange or not.
350,10,25,2c5,b'5rk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/2Ppq3/P7/1Q2P3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',The best way to defend the d6 pawn. I thought long and hard about playing b6 in an attempt to be rid of the pesky pawn. But after 26...b6 27. cxb6 axb6 28. Qc3! and white should be able to hold a draw. However I chose to immediately put some pressure on the king.
351,10,26,2h3,b'5rk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/2Pp1q2/P7/1Q2P2P/6P1/2R3K1 b - -',!? A very gutsy decision by white to create a worse pawn structure around his king.
352,10,27,2Kh2,b'5rk1/pp4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/1Q2P2P/5qPK/2R5 b - -',And here we reach a critical point in the game. It is almost as if white is daring me to play Rf3. My opponent was getting very low on time though(just under 15 minutes). I started to get really nervous. Second guessing myself and I began to struggle with my calculations. So I messed up.
353,10,28,2Rf3,b'6k1/pp4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/1Q2Pr1P/5qPK/2R5 w - -',? This move does not lose. I just have to be extremely precise with these next moves to force a draw.
354,10,29,2Qxb7,b'6k1/pQ4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/4Pr1P/5qPK/2R5 b - -',The obvious move. Now comes an important move for black. 29...Rxh3+! 30. Kxh3 Qxe3+ 31. Kh2 Qxc1 and I have a draw by repetition available to prevent white from promoting that d pawn.
355,10,30,2Qg3+,b'6k1/pQ4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/4PrqP/6PK/2R5 w - -',?? I missed it. Now white should easily be able to force a win. The only thing that was keeping my hopes alive was that white was in time trouble.
356,10,31,3Kh1,b'6k1/pQ4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/4PrqP/6P1/2R4K b - -',Forced.
357,10,32,3Rf2,b'6k1/pQ4pp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/4P1qP/5rP1/2R4K w - -',Anything else loses also. Just the threat is enough to make an opponent get scared and slip up sometimes though. 
358,10,33,3Qd7+,b'8/p2Q1kpp/2pPp3/2Pp4/P7/4P1qP/5rP1/2R4K b - -',?! Waste of time. White should just play Rg1 and push his d pawn.
359,10,34,3Rg1,b'8/p3Q1pp/2pPp3/2Pp1k2/P7/4P1qP/5rP1/6RK b - -',My position is completely lost. However I have one move up my sleeve that really threw my opponent off. It made him think for a while until has clock had run all the way down to under 3 minutes. That is when he messed up.
360,10,35,3Qg5,b'8/p3Q1pp/2pPp3/2Pp1kq1/P7/4P2P/5rP1/6RK w - -',Of course a simple move Qe8 followed by d7 and promotion should not have been too hard to find right?
361,10,36,3g4+,b'8/p3Q1pp/2pPp3/2Pp1kq1/P5P1/4P2P/5r2/6RK b - g3',? Wrong! Now the white king is very exposed. And that could become a major problem.
362,10,37,3Kg6,b'8/p3Q1pp/2pPp1k1/2Pp2q1/P5P1/4P2P/5r2/6RK w - -',Forced or else I lose the queen.
363,10,38,Kh6,b'4Q3/p5pp/2pP1r1k/2Pp2q1/P5P1/4P2P/8/6RK w - -',Now that my king is safe enough I can threaten mate with Qh4. My opponent did not have time to calculate how to prevent this so he did the simplest way of doing so.
364,10,39,3Qh5+,b'8/p5pp/2pP1r1k/2Pp2qQ/P5P1/4P2P/8/6RK b - -',? Exchanging! Now this game is probably a draw.
365,10,40,Rf7,b'8/p4rpp/2pP3k/2Pp3P/P7/4P2P/8/6RK w - -',! And now material will be equal.
366,10,41,4Rf4,b'8/p4rpp/2pP4/2Pp3k/P4R2/4P2P/8/7K b - -',Hoping that I will exchange rooks which of course I can't do or otherwise I can't stop promotion.
367,10,42,4Kg2,b'8/p4rpp/2pP2k1/2Pp4/P4R2/4P2P/6K1/8 b - -',?! Now that my king is in position to stop the pawn an exchange of rooks will pretty much force a draw.
368,10,43,4Rxf4,b'8/p5pp/2pP2k1/2Pp4/P4r2/4P2P/6K1/8 w - -',Which I was perfectly okay with at this point.
369,10,44,4Kg5,b'8/p4k2/2pP2p1/2Pp2Kp/P4P2/7P/8/8 b - -',?! A bit risky to get that far from my d5 pawn....
370,10,45,4d4,b'8/p4k2/2pP2p1/2P3Kp/P2p1P2/7P/8/8 w - -',This now forces f5 so that the king can catch the pawn.
371,10,46,5Kd3,b'8/p7/2pPk3/2P5/P2p3p/3K1p1P/8/8 b - -',There is no way either side can promote.
372,10,47,Kd7,b'8/3k4/2pP4/p1P5/P2p3p/5p1P/3K4/8 w - -',Draw agreed. This was a stressful game where my nerves got the better of me. I should have lost but I got lucky.

544,15,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -'," I have always like the Reti. 1.Nf3. After making my first move I noticed a game between Freddy and Joanne where Freddy states ""In my opinion you should not play this line against anyone above 1950 rating."" Get the game in the comment below.

So now I'm thinking ""Should I have played 1.d4 instead?"" On one hand I am playing an opening that Freddy suggests I don't play. On the other hand I do have his game against Joanne as a reference so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for. I will review and analyze that game before playing further."
545,15,1,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6p1/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',"1...g5!?

Upon playing 1.Nf3 I said to Freddy ""Let's play the Reti!""

He responds ""A good and sound opening lets make it unsound!"". Thus the move 1...g5.

So I have reviewed the game mentioned in the last move between Joanne and Freddy. He made the same move here that he made against Joanne. 

According to the Game Database this is called the Reti (A04) ""Herrstroem Gambit"" which I have never heard of before. Obviously Freddy is very acquainted with this. Uh-oh! 

So looking up various other references along with the GK Game Database I find the gambit is seldom played by most masters. When it's played they see the need to take that pawn! The GK World Database only has 3 games all of which include 2.Nxg5. The website 365chess only shows this move in the big database not the master database. There 11 out of 14 games have the gambit accepted. Wikipedia which gives a summary of all the openings and defenses (or so I thought) does not reference this Herrstroem Gambit at all.

I also feel that the g-pawn will cause me major problems if I don't take it. So in agreement with the masters..."
546,15,2,Nxg5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6N1/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I accept your offering Mister Master Mater Freddy!
547,15,3,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4p1N1/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"3.d3. In Joanne's game she played 3.d4. It's also the only move made by the masters on GK database. So in avoiding 3.d4 I automatically put myself out of the GK Master Database. I still have the GK regular database but that may not be much help since the games are those ranked 1600 and above. I stated previously ""I do have his game against Joanne as a reference so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for."" Yet after 3.d3 I won't even have that. So unless this position transposes back into a line the masters play I am on my own in uncharted territory!

On the other hand I need to go beyond making the moves the masters play and understand why they make their moves! My analysis says ""Set up a sound position maybe a KID reverse with Nf3 and g3. Hold on the pawn if possible but be ready to give it back if Freddy applies too much pressure. So 3.d3 hinders Freddy from playing ...e4 chasing my knight when I put him back on f3. Alternatively develop quickly and be prepared to castle long if need be to get my king away from the open g-file. The pawns on f2 g3 h2 and the fianchettoed bishop will give the king a good deal of protection if I short castle but not necessarily after he plays ...h5 ...h4 ...hxg3 giving Freddy two open files to his royal highness."""

That knight will have moved 3 times while I have no other furniture moved at all. I know how it is with these Master Mater guys: You give an inch of development and they take the whole board! So if 4.Nf3 Bg7 or 4.Nf3 Be7 and black is ahead in development with his king-side almost completely mobilized. Wait a minute I thought black is supposed to be a half tempo behind...
549,15,5,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5n2/3pp1N1/8/3P2P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So Freddy starts an imposing pawn center and I begin my first assault on that center. I am thinking of 6.c4 and if ...dxc4 7.Qa4+ followed by Qxc4. That would leave me with a mild attack on his c7. Then possibly drop Queen Esther back to b3 for a double attack on b7 to keep the c8 bishop harnessed. All of that is supposing he does not chase away the knight with h6 somewhere along the way or throw a different wrench in my plans.

Thanks a gain for the game and for taking me way out of my comfort zone! Good Game!"
572,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with the usual King's Pawn Opening.
573,16,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',"And this is how responds.  While I did not mention this I kept it in mind that she also could have responded with the Siclian 1...c5.  However what I told her was that this is the best move.  The reason that I omitted the Siclian is because the Master Mater told me that it would be very difficult for a student to learn the Siclian but that it's pretty easy to respond with the Kings Pawn Game.  The reason being is that one should learn the basics first and I absolutely agree with his assessment.  That's because when I first started and had a rating of sub 800 the first thing I was taught was the King's Pawn Game but I did not get familiar with it quickly.  Before I could Jack Stockel taught and made me become familiar with the Siclian Defense.  We just kept drilling it together until I became accustomed.  But it took me a month to get the variations correct.  And it usually does not take more then two weeks to accurately remember the moves of the opening.  
"
574,16,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I decide to continue with the most common variation and what I really seek is to develop and prepare to castle Kingside.  That's because I'm hoping that it will set a good remodel for my student.  And that will happen later on.
575,16,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',While this was perfectly normal I was hoping for 2...Nc6 instead so that she could get used to the Ruy Lopez.  But that is also about to happen.  However I decided not to make any comments about what I'm saying because this is a perfectly normal developing move.  And that's what I want her to start doing as it will lead to improvement.  I know this from past experience.  So I instead told her that this is a solid move as it develops and that she is already playing extremely well so far.  Normally I won't say this so early because anything can change.  But in addition to the mentoring I wanted to give Erica encouragement and build her optimisum in order to delay and reduce her Fight or Flight.  In my mind a good mentor and/or coach should always give the student encouragement and optimisum because that's what needed to improve your play.   
576,16,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So I decide to play this.  Fist my goal is to prevent and even exchange with the e pawn.  The reason being that I've had bad luck with it.  Second as noted earlier I'm trying to set a good example so that she will respond with pretty much the same move.  That's because as I learned with Mr. Arboite Jack Stockel's assistant at the time sometimes black will copy the same moves that white makes during the beginning.  And that is about to happen on Erika's next move. 
577,16,5,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',And that's exactly what I wanted so that she would get used to playing against the Ruy Lopez.  The moral to this is that you expect the unexpected and that you never know what the opponent is going.  So you have to plan ahead and be ready for anything that might come at you.  I realize that this is a good way for her to learn this since it is a one on one training sessions.  The more she can handle the better she'll become.  Right now I am very impressed with the way black is playing.
578,16,6,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',! I was very impressed with this move.  In fact I told her that is was a very good developing move.  Normally I would not mark with an exclamation point because better was 4...Bc5.  That's because the Master Mater told me that it's a good idea to place the B on the spot that covers the most squares.  However this move is an exception and it's something I don't really care about for my student.  The reason I gave it this marking is because it's another developing move.  Having said black is better developed then I have ever seen in her previous games.  In other words black developed more of her minor pieces then normal.  And that already shows significant improvements by reachforgold. 
579,16,7,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I am ready to go to the next step by castling.  And like before I am trying to remodel her am about to be successful as she is going to castle as well.
580,16,8,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',! Now I told her that this is another good move.  In fact this is best.  I told her that the reason behind it is because you generally want to castle ASAP in your games because King safety is important.  And I mentioned something that Judit Polgar said.  What was it?  In general you want to complete development by castling so I let her alone that this was another developing move from him.  And now I give her a compliment which is absolutely important.  I accurately pointed that she has not made any mistakes or errors.  But why is this important?  Well normally at this point black already would have made at least one mistake.  The fact she's managed to hold her own says a lot about this player.  
581,16,9,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - d3',So I decided to kick things up.  Unfortunately this time I made a mistake with advice.  I miscalculated and told her that looking out for pins is important and that I had the potential to pin her g5 N.  At the time I thought that the pin was serious but a second look shows that it isn't.
582,16,10,Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb4/1B2p3/3Pn3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',"?? This is when Erika asked ""What pin?""  Until I gave advice I had no idea that it would backfire.  But then I realized that I can take back with 7.Nxe4.  And for that @reachforgold: I'm sorry and do for miscalculating with this kind of advice.  But now there's something to learn from it.  Don't always go by what someone tells.  Although there usually accurate they can also make a mistake.  As someone once said ""Not everything someone says to you is correct therefore you also need to analyze the position and decide for yourself.""  In addition although I want to encourage and inspire her sometimes giving too much advice can be just as unhelpful as not studying or reviewing the position with the student.  It goes with the saying that much of a good thing can become bad.  So at this point although I give some I stop giving a lot of advice because I don't want to mix her up."
583,16,11,Na5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b4/nB2p3/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',?! I told Erika that I understand the logic behind this move.  She is trying to avoid an exchange since black's behind in material.  That's generally and she has the right idea.  But in general a knight on the rim is grim as that discouraging coach told me.  So normally that's the one principle that I don't emphasize or care too much about but this is an exception because I can win another piece if 8.Bd2.  However white is not going to play that because I have better plans instead.  But this is the last time where I give advice just because my student has moved and it's my turn to do so.
584,16,12,dxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b4/nB2P3/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',That's right.  I decide to test her because this is what mentoring is about.  I want to see if she'll make the capture or figure out that it's a mistake to do that.
585,16,13,Bxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/nB2b3/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',"?? But she does that.  That's because she wants to avoid losing more material.  Now I told Erika that this move is understandable and that in this position she is trying to avoid losing more material.  I absolutely like that because it shows that she's thinking.  But I accurately pointed that she missed the big picture and that this move is actually a serious blunder.  That's because white wins a free piece after 9.Nxe5.  So I taught her two things.  First there are occasions where ""To take is a mistake"" and that applies with this move.  Second but most importantly you always have to look ahead in terms of what you're opponent is thinking.  And this is why it's important to think more then one step ahead.  I know it's difficult to do but that's important to learn.  The reason being is that your opponents plans and opportunities are just as important as your own.  So before recapturing or responding ask yourself what does my opponent have in plan for me?  And what will happen if I play this?  In other words what are the consequences of this move? "
586,16,14,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/nB2N3/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',! So she decides to kick my N.  Believe it or not  I view this as a solid move because it shows that after what I said Erika is starting to think ahead.  I mean this the kind of thing that I would always do.  The only thing to learn is that @Erika: don't just attack material for the thrill of it.  But I like your thought process in this game.
587,16,15,Bf5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/nB3b2/2N1N3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Instead of reattacking my N she could have defended her remaining piece that currently stands on the rim.  Although I missed the opportunity to exchange her remaining N I won't do it this time.  However in this case I don't mind missing an opportunity because it means that she had another chance to fix her mistake.  Although I don't try for this I always like it when my students get a second chance to correct their mistakes.  Because if the student does this then he or she has learned something.  Unfortunately as I just mentioned that will not be the case here.  However @Erika: the moral of this is to take advantage of your second chances and opportunities while they exist.
588,16,16,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/N7/4b3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So I decide to attempt another exchange but this is another test.  This time however she passes the test.  Erika sees that I am threatening and instead of taking black decides to retreat.  If she had failed I would have pointed out the problem.  The lesson that my student learned is that it's generally a bad idea to exchange when you're behind.  Why?  Because it gives you less material then he or she needs since the attacks become overwhelming.
589,16,17,1Qh5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/N2b3Q/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Since I am almost completely developed I decide to bring the Q out.  Normally I wouldn't threaten mate in one like this because it's generally not a good idea to do something so obvious that could be driven off.  This however is the exception because I am giving her yet another test to my opponent.  Why?  From some of Erika's past games and annotations I see that this is another weakness that needs to be improved.  For example in one particular Erika's opponent got a SM against her because she missed the threat.  So making moves like this will actually help her.  I want black to see the obvious attacks and threats so that she knows what to do in situations like this.  This is part of me trying to teach reachforgold  to look ahead and start seeing what the opponent.  That way you can defend against threats like this.  
590,16,18,1g6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/N2b3Q/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',And the good news is that she just passed my test with flying color.  The only disadvantage is that no matter what black had played her LSB is gone when Erika is already behind.  
591,16,19,c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p1p/2pp2p1/N2Q4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',! So black hit's on my Q again.  Normally I would view this move as a waste of time and would therefore mark it as a ?! but not this time.  The fact that black is attacking it proves that Erika is starting to think ahead so I am extremely proud of her.
592,16,20,1Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p1p/2pp2p1/N7/8/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Now I could have forced a Q exchange and won a pawn with 15.Nb7 but I decided to hold off on it.  That's because I realize that this move could make for an interesting position.  Why?  When I prevent similar mating threats with Mr. Stockel he often plays moves like this where he puts pressure on my P closest to the R.  So you wind up with a position like this.
593,16,21,1b6,b'r2q1rk1/p4p1p/1ppp2p1/N7/8/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Ok I understand why she made this move.  Erika decides to launch another attack but I accurately told her that this is a mistake.  The reason being is that it loses another pawn.  But there is a lesson to learn from this as I pointed out.  With this I stated that you have to ask yourself what the opponent is attacking and will a move lose material and what your opponent is threatening to do.  And is there anything you can do about it.  In that better was 15...Qb8 or 15...Rb8.  
594,16,22,Qe8,b'r3qrk1/p4p1p/1pNp2p1/8/8/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',But that advice helped because she saw my intentions this time.  Erika realized that I was attacking her Q so she had to do something in order to defend it.
595,16,23,1Bb5,b'r3qrk1/p4p1p/1pNp2p1/1B6/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So now I decide to kick things up by putting pressure on the same piece that she just defended.  Why?  If 18.Nd4 we have a discovered attack on the Q.
596,16,24,1a6,b'r3qrk1/5p1p/ppNp2p1/1B6/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',But amazingly she sees this and reacts.  @Erica: That is the best move in this position.  This what I'm talking about in terms of seeing the attack and your opponents plans.  With that in mind I realize that black is now learning from her mistakes.
597,16,25,1Bd3,b'r3qrk1/5p1p/ppNp2p1/8/8/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So I have no choice but to retreat.
598,16,26,1Qxc6,b'r4rk1/5p1p/ppqp2p1/8/8/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"?? With that in mind I know why black moved here.  She thought that this would win back a piece and I can see why because until recently I made a similar mistake to this.  So I said that this is a serious blunder. And as they say ""To take is a mistake"" because of my next move. In this position what am I going to play?  She said ""take the queen and then i could take your queen with my pawn"".  And I replied Yes I take the Q. But the Queen is free after I play Qxc6. In fact not only does it win the Q but you mentioned about retaking with the pawn. The last move also loses a P because of my fork on d6 and b6. Now a fork occurs when two things are attacked by a pawn or piece. "
599,16,27,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/5p1p/ppQp2p1/8/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',? I understand that black was worried about losing her a R.  But that's not really a concern because she has her other R on the same rank so @Erika: if you left it there and I had played then 20.Qxa8?? you would immediately win my Q back with 20...Rxa8.  No matter what black does she will lose a pawn.  And there is nothing that can be done about it this time.  That's because had it not been the rook move but she played something like b5 to defend the pawn I would then take with the immediate 20.Qxd6.
600,16,28,d5,b'3r1rk1/5p1p/BpQ3p1/3p4/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',My guess is that black move here because she was worried about losing d5 pawn.  But @Erika: This is not a concern because like before your R is defended by the same R.  Like before however no matter what she played her b pawn is gone as well and there is nothing that could be done to defend both b and d pawns because if she played 20...Rb8 then I would take with 21.Qxd6 instead.
601,16,29,Rdc8,b'2r2rk1/5p1p/BQ4p1/3p4/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? In this position she is trying win back a pawn with this move.  But @Erika: This move is a blunder because it is going to lose your c8 R for my LSB.  First it's not an even exchange because a R is generally worth more then a B.  Second but most importantly you are down in material and this move holds you further.  Now as I mentioned earlier there's no way for her to catch up but it is part of a learning experience.  And what's important is keeping you material when you're behind.  So although you have learned and gotten better it's important to remember a couple.  Always think ahead and see what your opponent can do.
602,16,30,2Bh6,b'2r3k1/5p1p/1Q4pB/3p4/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So I decide to give her a pawn as it is another test to see if she can handle the situation.  If she passes however I will shortly mate after 24.Qf6.  Therefore either way mate is unavoidable one way or another.  Consequently this time it almost doesn't matter if she does or does not see the threat because unlike before there's not much more to learn at this point.  However this time she fails the test by deciding take c2 pawn.  
603,16,31,2Rxc2,b'6k1/5p1p/1Q4pB/3p4/8/8/PPr2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Consequently I now have and will mate in one with 24.Qd8#.  It's also possible that she saw the threat but also realized that there's almost nothing else to learn in which case our minds think alike.  So maybe she figured that there was nothing to lose by capturing my c pawn because I would mate sooner or later.  
604,16,32,2Qd8#,b'3Q2k1/5p1p/6pB/3p4/8/8/PPr2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Right after the capture and just seconds before this mate I told my student what a normal coach or mentor would say.  That is Well I hope you learned from this game. If you have questions please feel free to ask. And if you want to challenge me to another mentoring game I'll be available next week.  @Erika: The main morals are what I mentioned.  So in summary remember that your opponents are just as important as your own.  Always look ahead and ask yourself what the opponent.  Ask yourself if there's anything to look out for like mating threats or loss of material.  With that always think and plan ahead based on what your opponent can do so don't let your guard.  Also some of the things that a coach or mentor tells you unfortunately is not always accurate.  Therefore it's important for you to evaluate and see yourself.  Most importantly ""Don't get nervous"" and do not hyperfocus on one possibility like a worst case scenario that might occur.  Always try to see the big picture.  Lastly ""Don't give up right away"".  In other words try to stay in the game as long as possible.  If you can remember you will make significant improvements in your games.   "
605,17,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',White camp is attacking on the King side. I answer by 1. ... d5 right in the center because that is what is important in early game.

621,18,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Let's see if he lets me play my Caro-Kann. 
622,18,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I expect white to now play ex5 or some other developing move.
623,18,2,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pP2p/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq h6',This often becomes a target; I'll have to watch for that. But it's one way to slow down white's pawns on the kingside.
624,18,3,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Bg4 may have been better.
625,18,4,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',D4 might have been good. But this develops the bishop and has set up a discovered double attack on the h pawn if he chooses.
626,18,5,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is done to solidify black's pawn structure.
627,18,6,O-O,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',D4 for white was also playable here. No obvious way to use the early tempo for anything; it does not harm white to castle just now. And now I have a decision. Should I allow my light-squared bishop to be taken if white chooses to? I decide yes; it's early for such decisions but my g8 knight needs to be developed and I don't want to advance my g pawn just yet. Still that bishop is not really a bad bishop despite my pawn setup because of the h7-g1 diagonal.
628,18,7,Ne7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2npp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I take a chance here that white won't move Nh4 or Ng5. Taking my h pawn too can be a bit of trouble because it opens lines up now to the white king. In return there would be a lot of pressure on black's kingside. White opps for a quieter setup.
629,18,8,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2npp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White must have already intended this developing move and so my knight gets away with the maneuver. D4 was probably a little better for white here.
630,18,9,Ng6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This is a risk too; I am betting my opponent won't take advantage of my cramped kingside before he develops a little more. My king could come under some pressure here. As an side I am not afraid of h3 and g4 here. I have Nh4 to allow the bishop to retreat and to frustrate that would take white too long. One other risk too is that white could begin operations in the center or over on the queenside as my pieces are not very mobile. It may not be wise for white to seize the black h pawn... if he does it will be a very pitched battle.
631,18,10,c3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Now I've noticed that my opponent for castling so quickly is not developing quickly. And this move is a little slow too. I for that matter am very slow too. This allows me to fix my kingside.
632,18,11,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I ponder here whether white will wish to keep my knight out of g4 because that's where it's headed. I want to get rid of the f3 knight. I take a little too long to do that because I need to develop more first.
633,18,12,Na3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/N1PP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Still I get lucky here; this move is very very slow. I don't think white has a plan; it seems he is switiching ideas every couple of moves. Often when my opponent does this I'll consider taking the knight with the bishop to double up the pawns on the a file. But because things are a bit cramped on my kingside I don't want to allow play to happen on the queenside just yet because my pieces would be little help for some time over there.
634,18,13,Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/N1PP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',...bc5 would otherwise be a good move. Here I simply develop.

This seems like a lot of maneuvering for little gain.
636,18,15,1Nh4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P1n/2PP1N2/PPN1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',For some time white could probably win a pawn; but so far has chosen not to do so. Fritz much wanted me to castle Kingside here and does not like this move at all. But if I castle kingside I think my king will be vulnerable and it will hamper my own efforts for attacking on the kingside in this position. 
637,18,16,1Ne3,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P1n/2PPNN2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',This seemed odd to me; Nd4 a couple moves ago could have instantly troubled my light-squared bishop. As a result white is behind in development now.

I have thought up and discarded about three or four different plans involving sacrifices to crack open the kingside; None seemed good yet...
639,18,18,1Bxf3,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/2PPNB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I don't know if taking with the rook or pawn would have been better for the position. In general taking with the Bishop is correct but this position is a bit odd.
640,18,19,1Bg6,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1b1/3pP2p/5P2/2PPNB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',White could with just a little more preparation strike down at the kingside with f5! and I would have to defend a while. He chooses not to fortunately for me.
641,18,20,1d4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1b1/3pP2p/3P1P2/2P1NB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',He could have played d4 long ago. White is better here but still has some decisions to make as to how to make his positional advantage work. F5 would be very good for white and yet for many moves he ignores this possibility.
642,18,21,1Nb6,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1np1p1b1/3pP2p/3P1P2/2P1NB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',An immediate a4 is called for here to chase my knight and further throttle black's position. But my opponent chooses another move.

644,18,23,1c5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1n2p1b1/2ppP2p/3P1P2/1PP1NB2/P5PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This was not a good move. I had temporarily forgotten about f5 on the other side of the board and Fritz tells me this was not good! Oh well. At any rate now both sides of the pawn structure can be fractured while white's king remains behind his protection more secure than I would be. I have waited too long to castle and now don't feel comfortable castling anywhere.
645,18,24,1Kh1,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1n2p1b1/2ppP2p/3P1P2/1PP1NB2/P5PP/R1BQ1R1K b kq -',However I luck out. White apparently wants to see what I intend and rather than 'taking the game to me' he does this quiet move which is useful but probably not necessary here.
646,18,25,1Bb2,b'2rqk2r/pp2bpp1/1n2p1b1/2ppP2p/3P1P2/1PP1NB2/PB4PP/R2Q1R1K b k -',Again instead of f5 this move is a purely a defensive move. And I think not necessary. I believe black can get the initiative now.

649,18,28,1Qd7,b'2r1k2r/pp1qbpp1/1n2p1b1/3pP2p/1PpP1P2/2P1NB2/PB4PP/R2Q1R1K w k -',I wish to provoke white into advancing his a and b pawns a little before moving my bishop to an annoying square and repositioning. Then I'll be nearly ready to move on the kingside.
650,18,29,1a4,b'2r1k2r/pp1qbpp1/1n2p1b1/3pP2p/PPpP1P2/2P1NB2/1B4PP/R2Q1R1K b k a3',I have my pawns where I want them having obtained some space on the queenside and greater control on the h7-b1 diagonal. These pawns won't get far.

But I do it because I don't want to castle kingside and I want my king further from the action I am planning. Since white tied things up on the d and c files this move looked perfectly okay to me because I can obstruct the a and b pawns when the time comes.
652,18,31,1a5,b'2rk3r/pp1qbpp1/1n2p1b1/P2pP2p/1PpP1P2/2P1NB2/1B4PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',I expected that and I was going to reposition my knight anyways.

Those pawns aren't going to move and he's only blocking his own bishop. I don't know what he's thinking here but I know what I'm doing now; time to begin to fight back.

Second it's not really where I want my bishop to end up but in the time it takes white to chase it away I'll have received a couple of tempos for my real design which is to attack the kingside.

White did not have a plan; and 2. It was hard for him in Blitz to find the opportunities that he did have. The one mistake I think that really matters is his failure to get in f5 when black's king would have been vulnerable. White's king is not served now by being on h1; my rook is still eyeing that file.
659,18,38,2h3,b'2rk3r/1pn1bpp1/p3p3/P2pPb1p/RPpP1P2/2P2B1P/1B3NP1/2R4K b - -',There is no real threat here. If g4 hxg4 Nxg4 Rxh3+ and white loses a pawn. If white takes with the bishop I'll trade bishops and after the knight take the pawn still falls. But no matter white's designs this greatly weakens the dark squares and I immediately exploit that.

Black could also have played 18. ...b5.  white could not then play the en passant capture without losing the bishop and also could not move the B to c4.  PLUS black's bishop could get into the game.  Probably the better move.  Or would white be able to fight his way on to c4 and land the previously mentioned checkmate? Comments?

Back again!  This time I am gonna write about Welcome MT Part 9 in which in nearly every game bar my two with Freddy Glenda has had something to say.  I mean she even made Itchy scratch his head (if any of you have read that annotation by Coach Ion while I was away on my vacation).  Anyhow in this game Porcho gave me a bit of a headache and for a little while I was even fearing for Henry's safety as he was stuck in the centre.  Meanwhile I was also being tied down by his g pawn which was only one square away from queening.  Yup Porcho certainly showed me why his rating had soared into the 1300s before falling away again - shades of The Dentist methinks!  Things were going swimmingly for Porcho until after giving him a bone in the throat he was hit by a thunderbolt from Fou Lenoir.  He also found himself having to reckon with Glenda.  So how did all this happen?  Well read on......."

737,21,21,3Qd6+,b'8/pp2R3/3Q4/8/2pk1P2/2NP1b2/PPPK2p1/6R1 b - -',31. Qd6+ - I notice after hitting the submit button that I could have delivered mate here by Qe5.  However mate will come next move because all black can do is block the check with his bishop.  Glenda will swipe it next move and deliver the kiss of death which she duly does.  A welcome win.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Be back soon.  Bye for now - Joanne

In looking around for a good spot for my Knight my conclusion was that only Q7 was really desirable. To enable N-Q7 I would have to play my Bishop to N5 first.

After 32 P-R3 B-R4 33 P-N4 B-B2 34 P-B4 34... NxP would be my saving move.
770,23,12,3f4,b'3r2k1/2b3pp/p7/1p2q3/1P1rPP2/P3N2N/2RnQ1P1/3R3K b - -',White made the move P-B4 much too fast to suit me so I looked again carefully to see if there was anything wrong with 34... NxP. After 35 PxQ N-N6 ch 36 K-R2 NxQ White could not play 37 RxR? on account of ... BxP ch and ... NxR. He would have to play 37 RxB RxR 38 NxR RxN. Then 39 N-N5 was not agreeable for me but 39... R-Q sq 40 R-R7 P-B3 41 N-K6 R-K sq was a likely draw.

773,23,15,3Nxd1,b'3r2k1/2b3pp/p7/1p2q3/1P2nP2/P6N/2R1Q1PK/3N4 b - -',Now the Queen must move and either the Bishop or Knight will be lost.
774,23,16,3Rxc7,b'3r2k1/2R1q1pp/p7/1p6/1P2nP2/P6N/4Q1PK/3N4 b - -',"An error of a type Ossip Bernstein used to call the ""equalizing injustice of Chess."" Emanuel Lasker made the move without a second's hesitation. Evidently he had planned it at the time he played K-R2 and did not bother looking around for other possibilities. With N/Q1-B2 he would have won a whole piece and the game. After winning Knight and Bishop for his Rook White has by no means an easy ending. In fact it is doubtful whether this ending can be won at all. [Fischer had not yet been born but he later phrased it this way: ""You have found a good move. Look around for a better one."" -- LA]"
775,23,17,Qc8,b'2qr2k1/4Q1pp/p7/1p6/1P3P2/P6N/6PK/3N4 w - -',I am trying to keep the Knights from approaching. If 40 N-K3? 40... R-K sq wins a piece.
776,23,18,4Ndf2,b'2qr2k1/4Q1pp/p7/1p6/1P3P2/P6N/5NPK/8 b - -',With 40 N-N5 RxN 41 Q-B7 ch K-R sq 42 Q-R5 P-R3 43 QxR PxN 44 Q-R5 ch followed by QxP White could have produced a Q and P ending with 4 Pawns against 3 but it is highly problematic whether it could have been won.

R-K7 51 N/R3-B2 R-R7 52 Q-QB sq Q-B5 the Pawn falls after all. White therefore decides to take a chance and sacrifice his Knight on R6 in order to lay bare my King and attack with the Q the remaining Knight and the two connected passed Pawns.
779,23,21,Kd8,b'3k4/8/p5Q1/1p1q4/1P3P2/P6N/4r1PK/8 w - -',White could now draw with perpetual check checking on the seventh and eighth rows until I interpose my Rook or Queen thus relinquishing my mate threat.

781,23,23,Qd6,b'3k2r1/8/p2q4/1p6/1P3P2/P6N/1Q4PK/8 w - -',This guards the King against checks and at the same time keeps the Knight from approaching as long as the KBP is not protected.
782,23,24,Re7,b'8/2k1r3/p2q4/1p3Q2/1P3P2/P6N/6PK/8 w - -',I cannot prevent the Knight from occupying N5 any longer and therefore go ahead after the White QRP.
783,23,25,Ra1,b'1k6/4q3/p4N2/1p3Q2/1P3P2/6PK/8/r7 w - -',Of course not QxP as this would allow perpetual check through 67 Q-K5 K-N2 68 Q-Q5 etc.
784,23,26,Qh7,b'1k6/7q/p7/1p1N1Q2/1P3P2/6P1/6K1/7r w - -',White is now forced to exchange as he has only one check and his King would not be able to stand the combined attack of Rook and Queen.
785,23,27,Rh8,b'7r/8/p1k5/1p1N4/1P2KPP1/8/8/8 w - -',My plan is of course to drive the Knight first and then to advance the RP to clear the way for the NP. I am threatening check on K sq winning the Knight so the latter must now move. 
786,23,28,7a6,b'3r4/8/P1k5/8/1p2KPP1/4N3/8/8 b - -',77 P-N5?? would lose to 77... P-N6 78 N-B4 K-B4 79 N-N2 R-Q7 80 N-Q3 ch K-B5 81 N-K5 ch K-B6!
787,23,29,7Kc5,b'3r4/8/P7/2k5/1p2KPP1/4N3/8/8 w - -',Had I realized that White had a chance to draw I would have looked much more into the variations arising from 77... P-N6. I only figured ahead as far as 78 N-B4 K-N4 79 N-N2 KxP 80 K-K3 K-N4 81 P-N5 K-N5 82 P-N6 K-B6 83 N-R4 K-B7 84 P-B5. I analyzed it again after the game and concluded Black could win if he attacks the Knight [which keeps his Pawn from advancing] with R-QR sq. after first getting White's King to the 4th rank so the Knight is captured with check. This led me to claim that after 84 P-B5 84 R-K sq ch  85 K-B3 R-KB sq would seal White's fate. If after 86 K-B4 R-QR sq White plays 87 N-N6 he does not get a Queen at all. But White need not play 86 K-B4: he can draw with 86 P-N7! RxP ch 87 K-N4 R-B8 89 K-N5 winning the Rook in the end.
788,23,30,Ra8,b'r7/P7/8/2k5/4KPP1/1p6/8/3N4 w - -',The only chance to win. 79... K-N3 would be answered with 80 K-K3 KxP 81 N-N2 K-N3 82 P-B5 K-B4 83 P-B6.
789,23,31,Rd8,b'3r4/8/6P1/2k5/5P2/1p3K2/1N6/8 w - -',Obviously I cannot take the Knight as White's NP would Queen. But I can win both Pawns and I thought I still saw a possibility of winning the game.

792,23,34,Kxf4,b'8/8/8/8/NK3k2/1p4r1/8/8 w - -',It would take White 3 more moves I had calculated to capture the Pawn: K-R3 N-B5 and NxP. But at that moment my King would reach the square QB5 and the Knight would be lost because the Rook pins it! It never occurred to me that White need not capture the Pawn at all and could still draw the game. Emanuel Lasker actually discovered a new end-game position in which a R and P cannot win against a Knight and this position has since become a classic.
793,23,35,9Nb2,b'8/8/8/8/1K3k2/1p4r1/1N6/8 b - -',Examining the position carefully I soon realized I had no way of driving White's King away. However if I could reach Q7 with my King by playing him in back of my Rook I could still win. I made a last attempt.
794,23,36,9Ka3,b'8/8/8/8/N7/Kp2rk2/8/8 b - -',This foils my plan. After ...K-K7 White would play K-N2 and I could never approach.
795,23,37,Kd4+,b'8/8/8/8/N2k4/1K5r/8/8 w - -',We agreed to a draw. I felt quite discouraged naturally at seeing the win slip through my hands after more than thirteen hours of hard struggle. But when the excitement had subsided I came to regard this game as one of my best efforts.

810,24,14,1Bf5,b'r4rk1/ppp3p1/2p2q1p/R2nNb2/3P4/8/1P3PPP/1NBQ1RK1 w - -',I attack an unprotected knight and develop my bishop.  I think a much better move would have been to attack the rook on a5 following up with attacking whites central pawn - I was planning to do this after developing the bishop but white had something else in mind and I lost the opportunity.

Additionally if I attacked the Rook earlier with my b7 pawn I would have prevented the queen fork!  I didn't attack the rook because I thought it could too easily get out of trouble and pushing the pawn up one square seemed insignificant at the time.  Whilst I was keeping at eye out for whites queen I was expecting it to come across to my kings side...not the other way!

1) Pawns!!!  They are more powerful than I've given them credit for and I need to consider my opponent's pawn pushes more carefully.

4) If you see an opportunity - don't delay.

5) Think more carefully about the placement of my pawns when taking - not just for the next move but for the latter stages of the game.

Qh4 seemed to keep the defense on Qd4 but would give him an opportunity to develop the knight and prepare a castle. Qh5 forces a pawn advance. I still have the dark square bishop he may not want to castle short. Analysis shows Qd1 (a move I really didn't consider) as the best one. I still think maybe Qg3 may have been better. Would value opinions on Qg3 versus Qd1.

1106,37,20,2Ng5,b'r4rk1/pp2p2p/6p1/2P1QbN1/2q2P2/3p4/P4PP1/6KR b - -',All or nothing. In fact this loses quickly to 21...d2 22. Rxh7 d1=Q+ 23. Kh2 Rf6! White can't play 24. Qxe7 because of Qxf4+
1107,37,21,2Rxh7,b'r4rk1/pp2p2R/6p1/2P1QbN1/2q2P2/8/P2p1PP1/6K1 b - -',This is as much as I could have hoped for but as said previously it loses. 
1108,37,22,2Rf6,b'r5k1/pp2p2R/5rp1/2P1QbN1/2q2P2/8/P2p1PP1/6K1 w - -',? Now black must immediately give up the queen he has just won after 23. Qxe7 d1=Q+ 24. Kh2 Qh5+ 25. Rxh5. Of course the line still wins for black just not as quickly.
1109,37,23,Qf1+,b'r5k1/pp2Q2R/5rp1/2P2bN1/5P2/8/P2p1PP1/5qK1 w - -',"??
Wow!! What a turn around. I guess my opponent thought O.K. I will still be up a piece after 24. Kxf1 d1=Q+ 25. Qe1 Qxe1+. However that is not the case.... "
1110,37,24,2Kh2,b'r5k1/pp2Q2R/5rp1/2P2bN1/5P2/8/P2p1PPK/5q2 b - -',! This Wins. Now black must play 24.... Qh1+ 25. Kxh1 d1=Q+ 26. Kh2 Qh5+ 27. Rxh5 gxh5 28. Qxf6 is easily winning for white.
1111,37,25,2Qh1+,b'r5k1/pp2Q2R/5rp1/2P2bN1/5P2/8/P2p1PPK/7q w - -',Forced.

I kicked myself a lot after I played this. I had not even thought about black's response. I am still winning but the winning line is difficult to find."
1113,37,27,2Qxh7,b'r5k1/pp2Q2q/5rp1/2P2bN1/5P2/6K1/P2p1PP1/8 w - -',I had not anticipated this. I thought I would have a checkmate here... but alas I do not.
1114,37,28,2Qh8+,b'r4k1Q/pp6/5rp1/2P2bN1/5P2/6K1/P2p1PP1/8 b - -',"?
Now this game should be a draw by repetition. After 27...Ke7 28. Qg7+ Ke8 29. Qg8+ Ke7 and so on. Best would have been 27. Qxb7! d1=Q 28. Nh7+ Kg8 29. Nxf6+ Kf8 30. Qxa8+ and then I could have simply pushed my c pawn."
1115,37,29,2Qxf6,b'r3k3/pp6/5Qp1/2P2bN1/5P2/6K1/P2p1PP1/8 b - -',?? I did not even see Qg8+. I wrote it off quickly because I thought after 29...Rf8 there was not stopping promotion. But there was Qb3! Preventing the bishop from going to c2.
1116,37,30,2d1=Q,b'r3k3/pp6/5Qp1/2P2bN1/5P2/6K1/P4PP1/3q4 w - -',So now this is going to be  a very interesting endgame. I will be ahead 2 pawns and my opponent will be ahead a bishop after 30. Qh8+ Kd7 31. Qxa8 Qg4+ 32. Kh2 Qxf4+ 33. Kg1 Qxg5 34. Qxa7
1117,37,31,3Qf7+,b'r3k3/pp3Q2/6p1/2P2bN1/5P2/6K1/P4PP1/3q4 b - -',?! Waste of time I think. My objective was to drive the king as far away from the center as possible.
1118,37,32,3Qxa7,b'8/Qpk5/6p1/2P2bq1/8/8/P4PP1/6K1 b - -',And so here we are. Black can win but must play precisely.
1119,37,33,3Be4,b'8/Qpk5/6p1/2P3q1/4b3/8/P4PP1/6K1 w - -',Threatening checkmate. The only way to stop it is to play 36. Qb6+ Kb8 37. Qd6+ Ka7 38. Qg3 Qxc5. Losing a pawn would make black's winning chances much greater.
1120,37,34,Ka8,b'k7/1p6/3Q2p1/2P3q1/4b3/8/P4PP1/6K1 w - -',? This allows me to cut off the bishop and make its power limited. As far as my endgame knowledge goes this should be a draw.
1121,37,35,3f3,b'k7/1p6/3Q2p1/2P3q1/4b3/5P2/P5P1/6K1 b - -',! If Bxf3?? then Qf8+ forks the bishop and king.
1122,37,36,3Bc6,b'k7/1p6/2bQ2p1/2P3q1/8/5P2/P5P1/6K1 w - -',Now as long as I defend my pawns I should be O.K. 
1123,37,37,Qe8,b'k3q3/1p6/2bQ2p1/2P5/8/5P2/P5PK/8 w - -',Defends a draw by repetition and is looking to play Qh8+.
1124,37,38,4Qf6,b'k3q3/1p6/2b2Qp1/2P5/8/5P2/P5PK/8 b - -',Covers the h8 square.
1125,37,39,Qg3,b'8/kp6/2b5/2P3p1/8/2Q2Pq1/P5P1/6K1 w - -',So after shuffling our queens around for a few more moves my opponent allows me to get a draw by repetition. 
1126,37,40,5Qd8+,b'1k1Q4/1p6/2b5/2P3p1/8/5Pq1/P5P1/6K1 b - -',Draw agreed. It is amazing how much a game can change. From losing to winning to drawn. My opponent let me come back from a bad start and I just could not find the winning moves to finish him.
1127,38,0,Nbd2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',In preference to the older move N-B3 so that he can recapture with the Knight on QB4 and so make a strong point of his K5.
1128,38,1,Na6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/n3pn2/2Pp4/2P5/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black too will recapture with the Knight and make a strong point of his own K5. Note that 7... QN-Q2 is less accurate because of 8 P-B6.
1129,38,2,1cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/2nP4/8/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Giving up hope of working the Knight via QB4 to K5 with any effect.
1130,38,3,Qf6,b'r4rk1/pb3ppp/1p2pq2/2bn4/Q7/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Delaying the development of White's Q side and so gaining time.
1131,38,4,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2b5/1n6/4PN2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Showing his gain of time in the occupation of the open file.
1132,38,5,Qe5,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1p2p3/2b1q3/8/P3P3/1P2QPPP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',White is now ready to free his game by P-QN4 so Black must invade the White position at once. If however 20... Q-B4 to enter at QB7 White replies 21 P-K4. The text move is a finesse to gain time to bring the Queen to Q4. If White now replies 21 P-QN4 Black plays 21... B-Q3 22 P-N3 Q-K5 and the entry square QB7 is again under control.

1134,38,7,2Bd4,b'2rr1bk1/p4ppp/1p2p3/8/1P1B4/Pq2P1P1/4QP1P/R3R1K1 b - -',A last effort to keep Black out by 25 QR-B1 would fail owing to the weakness of the Q side after 25... P-QR4.

1138,38,11,Rfxh2,b'5bk1/pQ3ppp/1p2q3/8/1P4P1/P3P1B1/2r4r/R3R1K1 w - -',A most attractive forcing of the rank. If now 31 BxR Black has 31... QxNP ch 32 K-R1 Q-R6 forcing mate.
1139,38,12,Qd5,b'6k1/5pp1/1p3b2/3q3p/1P2R3/4P1B1/5R1K/8 w - -',He is reduced to an utterly negative position. One Rook must stay on the KB file to prevent ...P-KN4. The Bishop must stay on its present diagonal otherwise ...B-K4 ch follows. And what of the remaining Rook? If 41 R/4-B4 Black has 41... B-K4 42 RxP BxB ch 43 KxB QxR 44 RxQ KxR with a won K and P ending. If White tries 41 R-K8 ch Black plays 41.. K-R2 42 R-QB8 Q-K5 and more White pawns fall. So White resigns.
