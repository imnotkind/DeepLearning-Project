Therefore, I reckon that I've made the wrong choice because of Carl's next move.  Although he moves the same piece again, I'm going to lose a tempo here which is why I deem it to be inaccurate.

But, I knew that 16.Qxe6 was played, as that's how I wound up winning another pawn.  In addition, it wasn't possible to bring the Rook to e6 with check without 16.Qxe6 being played, first which is how I figured out that I captured with the Queen on e6.  However, it doesn't really matter, at this point.  The only difference is that I'm ending the annotation a little earlier then when the game ended.  As Carl resigned 3 or 4 moves later.  The reason being is that black was too far behind for counterplay.  It was interesting, but the thing to note is to calculate things carefully as one blunder often leads to another.  And, that's why it generally only takes one big mistake to go wrong.  That's especially when the mistake occurs within the first 10 moves, as TA noted."

As the d pawn is always a center pawn which is critical.  So, this move blocks the pawn.  Better would've been to develop elsewhere, so 4.Be2, 4.Bc4, or 4.Bb5.  I would've played 4.Bb5 as that a transposes into the Berlin Defense since the Berlin is 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6, and yes, sometimes white then answers with 4.Nc3.

From Erika's point of view since this is what I thought while learning the game, it looks very good.  But, this, however, is ineffective because that area was protected by the Queen.  By playing this, white just left her Knight en-prise, so it's the first blunder.  But, this is a bad one because black is going to win a piece for a pawn.  This early in the game (before the first 10 moves, as deeper_insight explains) that much of a difference is enough to win, in it of itself.  This shows why it's also not a good idea to place the opponent in check just because the opportunity is there as cplusplus11 in a different annotation.

This only happens when one is lost and has no good moves yet.  So, the only way is to hope that the opponent messes up and allows the draw.  When, however, there's still fight left, that's generally not the way to go.  Instead, you should assume that your opponent will find the best move, as Grandmaster Susan Polgar emphasized.  As noted, not only did 17.Nxe5 win a piece for a pawn, but it left another piece hanging.  And, I was talking about the one on d3.  So, this move allows black to just take.

It's important to know because a passed pawn is a pawn that's free to advance as it has nothing in front or to the side of that pawn to stop it's advancements.

Up until now, I was annotating more, even with a won game from black due to mistakes that she made.  However, she is not going to make any more mistakes and will force the win.  With that being said, I'm not going to annotate anymore here until the very end, as white is, officially, left with no good moves left.  By that, what's also being concluded is that white doesn't get anymore compensation of any kind, even a pawn. "

Even more is not capture, if what you're about to take is protected by a piece.  For example, you're threatening to win a pawn with your Knight, but that pawn is protected by his or her Knight, you shouldn't capture it because that allows the opponent to win a piece for a pawn, Erika.  So, with the first two mistakes, what's important is, ""To take is a mistake.""  Before, you take it's important to think about and ask yourself how your opponent will respond.  Remembering is key to becoming a better chess player."

After you have witnessed my two losses against IM David Patron I bet you may be wondering whether things may be coming in threes, although at least I was playing someone much closer to my rating.  However, in the opening he apparently blundered his queen for Fou Leblanc.  However, a few moves down the line, Henrythefifth showed me that my own King Henry was potentially in deep doodoos.  So, the question is, will Henry meet an inglorious end or will Glenda be able to make her presence felt just in the nick of time?  If you do not wish to see the spoiler below then do read on."

For a starters, I do not like the fact that Glenda is on a discovery line (the a4 to e8 diagonal).  I also mislike the fact that black has the bishop pair (this was a telling factor in Easy 19 - aka The Master Mater's queen sac MTs) to rake across the board and inflict a lot of potential damage.  His knight on g4 looks ominously pesky.  There is a rook blasting down the h column and he could double up on it in a few more moves if I do not watch out.  Finally his d5 pawn is a passer in a very strong looking pawn chain.  Yup, at this point black is better.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?"
