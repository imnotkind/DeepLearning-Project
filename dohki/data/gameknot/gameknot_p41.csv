0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So I start conventionally. 
1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A normal developing move preventing e2-e4
2,0,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This is the normal move in this position.
3,0,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Another normal move opening a diagonal for his bishop.
4,0,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So I continue to develop threatening e2-e4 with a big pawn centre.
5,0,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is now a Nimzo-Indian defence.
6,0,6,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I play the main line.
7,0,7,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is called the Fischer Variation as it was played occasionally by the late World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer in his youth. In fact he was more famous for playing the King's Indian or Gruenfeld as black against 1. d4. 
8,0,8,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',So I continue my development threatening e3-e4 again.
9,0,9,Bb7,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',He develops.
10,0,10,f3,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBPP2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This seems to me a very natural move blunting the Bb7 and preparing e3-e4 at some stage.
11,0,11,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBPP2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq d6',He tries to block e3-e4. I was quite happy to see this move. if ever he doubles my c pawns with Bb4xc3 I can always undouble them with c4xd5.
12,0,12,Nge2,b'rn1qk2r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBPP2/PP2N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I continue my development.
13,0,13,Nbd7,b'r2qk2r/pbpn1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBPP2/PP2N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',He develops his knight to a fairly logical square.
14,0,14,a3,b'r2qk2r/pbpn1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/P1NBPP2/1P2N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Again this seems like a logical follow-up to my last move.
15,0,15,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NBPP2/1P2N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Instead of exchanging he retreats but I think this square is inferior because if I decide to advance with b2-b4 and c4-c5 I will gain a tempo by attacking his bishop or if I decide to advance in the centre e3-e4 will threaten e4-e5 forking his bishop or knight. I think he would have been better to retreat to e7 or to exchange bishop for knight. Now I can't advance in the centre immediately because he has a nasty queen check on h4 for instance 9.	e4? dxe4 10. fxe4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4	Bxe4 12. Bxe4 Qh4+ followed by taking the bishop on e4.
16,0,16,O-O,b'r2qk2r/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NBPP2/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I castle instead.
17,0,17,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NBPP2/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And so does he.
18,0,18,1e4,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/3p4/2PPP3/P1NB1P2/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I advance in the centre but with the gift of hindsight I think this may be premature. Maybe Kh1 is better so that his bishop can't go to c5 with check although having said that my computer likes this move!
19,0,19,1dxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/8/2PPp3/P1NB1P2/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',So he takes. My computer likes the other take dxc4 but dxe4 seems quite natural to me too!
20,0,20,1fxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1bpn2/8/2PPP3/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I take back.

22,0,22,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1b1n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',And this is this move but it allows black some activity.
23,0,23,1Bc5+,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p3n2/2bPp3/2P1P3/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This check for instance - this is why I wondered after the match maybe I should have played 10. Kh1 instead - have you any thoughts dear reader?
24,0,24,1Kh1,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p3n2/2bPp3/2P1P3/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',this move is forced.
25,0,25,1Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p6/2bPp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Now he is threatening Nf2 forking my king and queen.
26,0,26,1Qe1,b'r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p6/2bPp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1B1QR1K b - -',"So this move is virtually forced. Now the move I was afraid of him playing is Be3. I think exchanging dark squared bishops is good for him. Although his bishop sits on a good square now it can be forced off that square with b2-b4. For that reason the move a7-a5 also comes to mind. However although is it undeveloped at c1 my Bc1 can be considered my ""good"" bishop. it can move unhampered by my pawns. His Bc5 is potentially a ""bad"" bishop blocked in by his pawns. To me exchanging bishops makes a lot of sense. I was quite glad to see that my computer agrees with me too!"
27,0,27,1Bc8,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pn1ppp/1p6/2bPp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB4/1P2N1PP/R1B1QR1K w - -',Not sure of the point of this move - I was delighted that he played it.
28,0,28,1Rf3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pn1ppp/1p6/2bPp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB1R2/1P2N1PP/R1B1Q2K b - -',He is not going to get a chance to exchange on e3 now! My computer prefers Qg3 - which I was considering - with the same aim of preventing him from playing Be3.
29,0,29,1Be7,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p6/3Pp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB1R2/1P2N1PP/R1B1Q2K w - -',This is again heading in the wrong direction! a7-a5 makes more of a fight of it!
30,0,30,1h3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p6/3Pp3/2P1P1n1/P1NB1R1P/1P2N1P1/R1B1Q2K b - -',So I drive his knight back.
31,0,31,1Ngf6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1NB1R1P/1P2N1P1/R1B1Q2K w - -',It drops back - notice how my Bc1 prevents it from going back to h6. Although black is very passive now I still have to be careful so instance Bc1-g5? is answered by Nxd5! winning a pawn for black.
32,0,32,1Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1NB1R1P/1P1BN1P1/R3Q2K b - -',So I develop my bishop to this square instead intending to advance on the queen-side.
33,0,33,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/p1pnbppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1NB1R1P/1P1BN1P1/R3Q2K w - -',This doesn't do much.
34,0,34,1b4,b'r1bqr1k1/p1pnbppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/1PP1P3/P1NB1R1P/3BN1P1/R3Q2K b - b3',So I advance.
35,0,35,1Nf8,b'r1bqrnk1/p1p1bppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/1PP1P3/P1NB1R1P/3BN1P1/R3Q2K w - -',Knight drops back. Black is incredibly passive.

41,0,41,2Bd7,b'r2qr1k1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/2P1P3/P1NB3P/3BNQP1/R4R1K w - -',He continues these manoeuvres which don't achieve much.
42,0,42,2a4,b'r2qr1k1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/2NB3P/3BNQP1/R4R1K b - -',So I carry on with my plan.

But of course I don't have to take I was thinking of just moving my Ne2 in reply - probably to g2. I don't want to allow exchanges while he is so badly cramped.
45,0,45,2Qd8,b'r2qr1k1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/2NB3P/3BNQPK/R4R2 w - -',So he starts shuffling pieces again.
46,0,46,2Ra3,b'r2qr1k1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/5R2 b - -',And I continue wth my plan.
47,0,47,2Rf8,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/5R2 w - -',More shuffling.
48,0,48,2Rfa1,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/1p3nn1/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 b - -',Preparing a4-a5
49,0,49,2Nh5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/1p4n1/1PpPp2n/P1P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 w - -',I am not sure this achieves much either.
50,0,50,2a5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/1p4n1/PPpPp2n/2P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 b - -',So I just carry one.
51,0,51,2bxa5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/6n1/pPpPp2n/2P1P3/R1NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 w - -',He takes.
52,0,52,2Ra3xa5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/6n1/RPpPp2n/2P1P3/2NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 b - -',I take. His pawn on a7 is very weak now. I was rather expecting Qc7 now.
53,0,53,2f5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bb1pp/6n1/RPpPpp1n/2P1P3/2NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 w - f6',But instead he lashes out on the king-side.
54,0,54,2exf5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bb1pp/6n1/RPpPpP1n/2P5/2NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 b - -',I just take.
55,0,55,2Nh4,b'r2q1rk1/p2bb1pp/8/RPpPpP1n/2P4n/2NB3P/3BNQPK/R7 w - -',Knight comes in.
56,0,56,2g4,b'r2q1rk1/p2bb1pp/8/RPpPpP1n/2P3Pn/2NB3P/3BNQ1K/R7 b - g3',I protect my pawn
57,0,57,2Qc7,b'r4rk1/p1qbb1pp/8/RPpPpP1n/2P3Pn/2NB3P/3BNQ1K/R7 w - -',He threatens a discovered checks with e5-e4
58,0,58,3Be4,b'r4rk1/p1qbb1pp/8/RPpPpP1n/2P1B1Pn/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 b - -',So I block his e pawn.
59,0,59,3Nxf5,b'r4rk1/p1qbb1pp/8/RPpPpn1n/2P1B1P1/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 w - -',He now sacrifices a knight.
60,0,60,3gxf5,b'r4rk1/p1qbb1pp/8/RPpPpP1n/2P1B3/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 b - -',S I take. 
61,0,61,3Bxf5,b'r4rk1/p1q1b1pp/8/RPpPpb1n/2P1B3/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 w - -',He sacrifices a bishop.
62,0,62,3Bxf5,b'r4rk1/p1q1b1pp/8/RPpPpB1n/2P5/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 b - -',I take back. I was thinking that Kh8 was probably the best move for him so that i don't have Bf5-e6 check. I think he can then follow it up with g7-g6 and get back a piece. I am still a piece up but it is better than the game continuation.
63,0,63,3Rf6,b'r5k1/p1q1b1pp/5r2/RPpPpB1n/2P5/2N4P/3BNQ1K/R7 w - -',He prepares to double his rook but....
64,0,64,3Ne4,b'r5k1/p1q1b1pp/5r2/RPpPpB1n/2P1N3/7P/3BNQ1K/R7 b - -',I can just attack the rook and Rf7 can be met by either Bxh7 check or even better Be6
65,0,65,3Rff8,b'r4rk1/p1q1b1pp/8/RPpPpB1n/2P1N3/7P/3BNQ1K/R7 w - -',So the rook drops back.
66,0,66,3Qf3,b'r4rk1/p1q1b1pp/8/RPpPpB1n/2P1N3/5Q1P/3BN2K/R7 b - -',And he resigns. Many thanks for reading. Please rate it on the star system and add a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!
67,1,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Not to my surprise he plays the Siclian.
68,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I anticipated 3...cxd4 and then I would've continued the open variation.  4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6  
69,1,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now I could've played 4.dxc5 with the idea being that after 4...dxc5 5.Qxd1+ Kxd1 so black would lose his right to castle.  But I realize that after 4...dxc5 he can quick play 5.Nxe4 and I would not like my position.  The reason is that grabbing the center pawn means better control of the center which is something that you don't want to do.  That's because of the fact that center control is important so without risking my center I was going to protect e4 one way or another.  Of course we are going to transpose into the same line as what you'd see with 4.dxc5 when he does take.
70,1,3,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Since I'm very used to this and the fact that white is threatening to mess up black's pawn structures I decide to play this.  The idea being is that espeically in this position doubled pawns is something that you don't want.
71,1,4,Bd7,b'rn1qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',?! Black fails to meet that threat.  Best was 6...e5 not only allowing black to retake with the Q should I take but preventing me from playing ...Bxf6 as the N's attacked.  Plus it allows black to catch up on his center control.  The idea being is that I must defend my N and lose tempo while he gains tempo gain.  But with this inaccuracy I will take advantage of my opportunity to exchange and mess up his pawn structure.  Not only that but I gain needed tempo in the process to complete development and castle at once.  
72,1,5,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/1p1bbppp/p2p1p2/8/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Although this develops he is left with a bad B which was part of my plan behind exchanging on f6.
73,1,6,d5,b'rn1qk2r/1p1bbppp/p4p2/3p4/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',? With the idea being to give him a better place for his DSB so that it's no longer a bad bishop.  The only problem is that this move loses a pawn.  Better was 9...Nc6 developing another piece or castling at once with 9...0-0.
74,1,7,Bc5,b'rn1qk2r/1p1b1ppp/p4p2/2bN4/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',His plan is to gain time to bring out another piece and/or castle.
75,1,8,1Nb3,b'rn1qk2r/1p1b1ppp/p4p2/2bN4/4P3/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',So given that I'm up a pawn it's not overgeneralizing so now is the time to do the kind of thing that you'd see a GM.  Since he attacked my N with his DSB so now I reattack black's DSB.  Yes that's what you see and I have also seen examples in some of charleshiggies annotations that one someone attacks one of his pieces he reattacks.  But there was a short term plan as well.  In addition this hinders further development from black since now Ron must protect it.
76,1,9,1b6,b'rn1qk2r/3b1ppp/pp3p2/2bN4/4P3/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I would've retreated the DSB if I were black.  The idea being is that I can't take.  What to keep in mind is that I'm up so given that liquidating pieces is to my benefit so with it I will take on c5.  Had he retreated however this would as we know not have been possible. 
77,1,10,1Re1,b'rn1qk2r/3b1ppp/p4p2/2pN4/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',As I learned from tactical-abyss in a previous snapshot analysis thread one of controlling the center is to attack it.  So by placing the R on the center square that is attacking the opponents center.
78,1,11,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/3b1ppp/p4p2/2pN4/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',! A good choice as K safety is important.  In fact I studied a very instructive annotation by alex_ratchkov involving a GM game.  And although his opponent had an advantage due to being up a pawn the reason why Paul Morphy won was because his opponent failed to castle.  Instead he got greedy and tried to win another pawn by taking on c6 which sealed his fate.
79,1,12,1e5,b'rn1q1rk1/3b1ppp/p4p2/2pNP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Bearing in mind that he can't win that pawn so I continue advancing.  The plan here is to get a passed pawn.
80,1,13,1Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/3b1ppp/p4p2/2pNP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',But once he played  this I knew that it would not be possible to do it.
81,1,14,1exf6,b'rn1qr1k1/3b1ppp/p4P2/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',So I take it knowing that I'm still ahead and now in order to prevent the loss of another of a pawn black would have to ruin pawn structures around bearing in mind that due to my N he can't take with the Q.  Ruining the pawn structures means that his K will eventually become exposed.  That's not absolute but this is the plan if he finds the right move.  It's of no cheapo tactic but there's a small amount of Hope Chess but only because of what I learned from Damios that in chess you want to come up with a threat that is difficult to drive off.  And opening up those pawn structures is indeed a threat.  So with that my plan was 15...gxf6 16.Rxe8+ Bxe8 17.Qf3 or 17.Be4 to allow 18.Nxf6 with a combo because if 18...Qxf6 then I capture on a6 winning a R for a N.  
82,1,15,1g6,b'rn1qr1k1/3b1p1p/p4Pp1/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Not exactly sure why he played this.  My guess was to open up.  But best was 15...gxf6 and if I am able to play Qf3 through the variations that I mentioned earlier he could protect his R with Bc6 and gain tempo.  But this move however loses another pawn.  Plus I will continue liquidating pieces.
83,1,16,1Be4,b'rn1qb1k1/5p1p/p4Pp1/2pN4/4B3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',As noted earlier I had a tough time deciding between this and 17.Qf3  The reason I played is because I felt that 17.Qf3 was a little unsound.  Sure if he took my N I could take back.  And it is good to exchange but this was in my opinion a little of an exception.  That's because my N is the one that I don't want him to take as I feel that I can pose more threats with it.  Therefore the only other option would be the loss of tempo by exchanging.  But with the B there it is another story for if I took back the threats would be more immeidate and harder to drive off I felt.  But the plan is not to exchange here however but rather to put pressure against his longest diagonol due to how many squares my B now covers which is about which is about 9 squares.  And I also keep in mind that black still hasn't completed his development so I know that I have threats based on other games I've studied and one I've coached where the other player loses by not completing his or her development.  And that is starting to happen here as the position is starting to become similar.
84,1,17,1Nc6,b'r2qb1k1/5p1p/p1n2Pp1/2pN4/4B3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',?? Developing another piece but it is too little too late because of what I'm about to do.  Best was 17...Kf8 to prevent what I'm about to do which is not only liquidate pieces but at the same time win his R for my N and pawn in addition to what I've won.
85,1,18,1Bxa8,b'B2qb1k1/4np1p/p4Pp1/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',"I had a hard time deciding between 19.fxe7 or 19.Qxe7.  I likely would've played 19.fxe7 because after the exchange he can pick win back another pawn after 19...Qxe7 which would give a small amount of compensation.  But just when I almost I found this move which is better for the obvious reason so as the saying goes ""when you think you've found a good move look for something better."""
86,1,19,1Qxa8,b'q3b1k1/4np1p/p4Pp1/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',19...Qxd1 doesn't help as I recapture.  With this move I will grab his other N.  And with it I will now have a passed pawn which will prove to be a killer.
87,1,20,Qb7,b'4b1k1/1q2Pp1p/p5p1/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',To prevent my pawn from advancing further.
88,1,21,2Qd8,b'3Qb1k1/1q2Pp1p/p5p1/2p5/8/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',But it's too late unfortunately.  Bear in mind that I'm just now starting to think about the game with charleshiggie.  The idea that black must lose his LSB to prevent me from promoting which is something that I kept in after I grabbed his N.  Plus I know how charles and Janet both promoted as it started with a capture similar to this.
89,1,22,2Qxb2,b'3Qb1k1/4Pp1p/p5p1/2p5/8/8/PqP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',The logic is that black might as well take.  I hate to say it but there's no good moves left so capturing gives him a pawn back temporarly.
90,1,23,2Qxe8+,b'4Q1k1/4Pp1p/p5p1/2p5/8/8/PqP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',I was going to play this one or another but I quickly figured out that even giving up his B I can still promote with this check.  The thing is that I thought it would take much longer but this more and more where that instructive game settles right since there are going to be three.  Now given that I'm ahead and will have the Q it will very difficult to impossible for black to compensate.  The reason I don't say absolutely impossible is that sometimes there is counterplay and against all odds you can get a stalemate.  But I do calculate ahead to how he might do so if I make mistakes and prevent that at all costs since it's about capitalizing on your advantages.
91,1,24,2Qf8+,b'5Q2/4Ppkp/p5p1/2p5/8/8/PqP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Knowing that his last move was directly forced I dump in another check with my pawn.
92,1,25,2Re1,b'5Q2/4Pp1p/p4kp1/2p5/8/8/PqP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',To be honest I would've promoted at once here.  But in this case I knew that doing so wouldn't just allow him to get back a R but it would be mate.  In other words if 24...e8=Q?? 25.Qa1#  The reason I say it is that I wasn't far from missing this threat which would be bad as I throw away a win.  However I remembered this same mistake in another game and by promoting with an advantage like this he was able to force the win due to a mate in one that I overlooked.  So knowing the mistake I made there prevented me from making it here.  The idea is as a mentor and other have told me you're supposed to learn from your mistakes so that it doesn't reoccur.  Yes that's how you become a better chess player.
93,1,26,2Qb4,b'5Q2/4Pp1p/p4kp1/2p5/1q6/8/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Still wants to create a threat.  Now is the time to be unsound and attempt a cheapo tactic since it's lost.  So the idea was to mate me.  It is a very good attempt but I will promote one way or another.
94,1,27,2e8=Q,b'4QQ2/5p1p/p4kp1/2p5/1q6/8/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',I had a very tough time deciding between this and 25.Qxf7 and after 25...Kxf7 26.e8=Q+  I did have in mind that after 26.e8=Q+ 26...Kf6 (forced) 27.Qe6+ which I thought was mate but had another look to realize that he could escape with something like 27...Kg5  I also forgot temporarly that my R is behind the passed pawn where it's supposed to be.  So why not promote.  Last but not least however this is where that game between charleshiggie and brigadecommander really settled in.  I remembered that promotion and realized that unlike that game Ron would not be able to compensate or promote.  Therefore we weren't going to have 4 Q's.  Plus unlike there where one Q on each side was taken very quickly he could not recapture at all.  So being that I have more material and now have an extra Q it is a forced win which I decide to take advantage of.
95,1,28,2Qc4,b'4QQ2/5p1p/p4kp1/2p5/2q5/8/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',?? I don't know why he played this but with this move I will mate him immediately.  One way or another it's mate but better was 25...Kf5 but either way it's still mate in 3  26.Qe5+ Kg4 (forced) 27.h3+ Kh4 (forced) 28.Qh6#
96,1,29,2Qe5#,b'5Q2/5p1p/p4kp1/2p1Q3/2q5/8/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',"Overall this was a fun and enjoyable.  But black went wrong by failing to complete development because I was able to swarm in take advantage and deliver a devastating attack with his undeveloped pieces especially since it allowed me to get an unstoppable passed pawn.  So what applies especially applies here is something that I mentioned in the annotation involving the last person that I coached which other coaches as well as GM's emphasize.  ""Openings must be used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the midgame will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results""  In addition as noted in the intro it's not always about quantity but rather quality.  Therefore it's not about learning as much as you can; but rather retaining and what you've learned and using them for your games.  For that I would as usual like to thank charleshiggie for his instructive annotations and being a good teacher as well as Ron for this good game at Chicoboy's Legacy Club. "

106,2,9,cxd5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/3p4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I take back.

109,2,12,d3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/6p1/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"Now this is looking more like a King's Indian Defence reversed more than ever. White formation is also similar to the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence_Dragon_Variation
Now against both those set-ups an effective attacking set-up is f2-f3 Be3 Qd2 0-0-0 h2-h4-h5 so ideally I would like to do something similar here even though g7-g6 and Bf8-g7 don't really fit in with that plan."
110,2,13,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/6p1/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',For now I develop my knights.

115,2,18,1Rc1,b'r1bqk2r/pp2n1bp/2n2pp1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',Normal development.

128,2,31,1a6,b'r3k2r/1p1q3p/p1n1bpn1/2Rpp1p1/1P6/P2PPNP1/3B1PBP/3Q1RK1 w kq -',I was thinking that maybe I could play 0-0-0 after all or maybe if he continues with b4-b5 I can exchange pawns on b5 and have a nice open line for my rook. Maybe I should have just got on with my attack. What do you think dear reader?
129,2,32,1Qc1,b'r3k2r/1p1q3p/p1n1bpn1/2Rpp1p1/1P6/P2PPNP1/3B1PBP/2Q2RK1 b kq -',Again this is quite thematic doubling on the c file. If I let him he can play a3-a4 b4-b5 and after my knight on c6 moves Rc7 is strong for him. I considered 17.....0-0-0 and came to the conclusion that my king would be under great risk for instance O-O-O 18. a4 Kb8 19. b5 axb5 20. axb5 Nce7 and my king is looking very draughty with White having both c and a files to attack down. So I decided to just get on with my attack. I'd love to play Be6-h3 here and exchange his Bg2 which is a good defender. However Bh3 18.	Bxh3	Qxh3 19. Rxd5 drops a pawn. So I decided on another move.

The First American Congress which later became the US Championship took place in the fall of 1857 in New York. It attracted the 16 best players in the country and like the London event it was held on the KO system: mini-matches of first to win three games and in the final - five games. This was Morphy's first tournament and he demonstrated his complete dominance over the field in fine style as this game against the second-strongest player of the tournament (and likely the second-strongest player in the US at the time) clearly shows. He easily reached the final (nine wins and one draw!) where he proceeded to crush the as yet little-known German Louis Paulsen who was then living in the US. Moreover Morphy played quickly as usual whereas his opponent played very slowly and since the time for thinking was not yet restricted (chess clocks were still a couple of decades away!) the games lasted 10-11 hours and the drawn second game of the Final as long as 15 hours (out of which Paulsen thought for 12!). This sixth game is probably the most famous game of the match.

The other tries were: 8...a6 (6); 8...d5 (2); 8.Ne5 (1 - though this probably transposed into something else in the database).

Here Black played 11.Qa6  12.h3 Qxa4 13.hxg4 ... and the game was eventually drawn.  Had I played 12.h3 now we would simply have transposed into that game - for a while at any rate. It is possible that Jo thought her move was a refinement that kept c7 covered.   But the GK engine calls this a mistake suggesting instead 11...Ne3ch 12.Bxe3 Qxe3 though after 13.Rd1 White can contrive pressure down the d-file.  It seems as though that White would have got only the smallest of edges in this line.

This is why all threats however easily defended must be taken seriously. With her response Black bats the bishop away with ease but in so doing weakens the defence of her e-pawn.  Why that is significant you will see.

Of course White could have played this a move earlier but then e6 would have been rock solid...  Either way the difference between 11...Qa6 and 11...Qa5 is revealed.  With the Black Queen on a6 this move would not have been available and White would probably have had to choose between  12.h3 and 12.Nc7 (i.e. instead of Bg5ch).

I decided it could wait for a more opportune time.  Taking the rook is pretty much the end point of White's combination and now would have been the moment for Black to see about picking up the initiative.  That her Queen was under immediate attack however rather limited her options.

Presumably black wants to keep the f g and h pawns together to allow king's side castling with an intact pawn formation in front of the castled king. Taking back with the f pawn also gives black an isolated e pawn.
259,7,24,1Bb2,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n1nb3/8/4PP2/1PN2N1P/PBQ3P1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This seemed the best square for the bishop.
260,7,25,1a6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/pn1nb3/8/4PP2/1PN2N1P/PBQ3P1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I think a6 is a mistake. Black should concentrate on getting pieces developed and king safely castled. Black has a plan to exchange some minor pieces to lessen the cramping effects of White's powerful pawn centre but Black just don't have time for this.

I think Black must just accept further cramping with 15.... Be7 16. e5 Nc8. Black is horribly cramped but is still in the game and maybe can play 0-0 if necessary although White seems to have a ready made attack on the king side with Bf1-d3 attacking the pawn on h7 and White's king side pawns are already advanced and so ready to open up files if Black weakens the king side with g7-g6 or h7-h6. Basically Black has got a bad position due to faulty opening play going back as far as move 2!
265,7,30,1e5,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqppp/pn1n4/4P3/5PP1/1PN2N1P/PBQ5/2KR1B1R b kq -',So I push on.

White would still be better but Black is still in the game. Note that White can't take on c7 immediately as Black as Ra8-c8 wins the White queen. Notice how although White is better I still have to be very careful!

I think Black need to play c7-c6. the Knight on b6 can then come back into play onto d5 - although not immediately as white can play Bf1 x b5 and if Black captures the bishop on b5 the knight on d5 is capture by the rook d1. But Black can prepare Nb6-d5 with Bd7-e6.
Now White's simplest win is e5-e6 attacking the bishop on d7 but also opening up the diagonal for my bishop on b2 to attack his rook on h8. Unfortunately I had become fixated about taking the c pawn with my queen. This is quite a common mistake in chess. One gets a plan in the head and doesn't spot another opportunity which has arisen."

Bd7-f5 check and after 20. gxf5 Black wins the White queen with Qxc7."" But then in my mind I started to study that position. White is actually still winning even though I have just lost my queen! I can play 21. Bf1xb5 check. Now if Black blocks this check with Nb6-d7 then 22. Rxd7 wins for instance 22...Qxd7 23. Bxd7 check and if Black recaptures on d7 with 23.... Kxd7 then White has e6-e7 check opening up the long diagonal for my bishop on b2 to take the Black rook on h8 and White is materially ahead. 
After 19. Qxc7 Bf5+ 20. gxf5	Qxc7 21. Bxb5 check apart from just throwing away the queen with Qc6 or Qd7 the only other way out of check by Black is to play Ke8-e7. But then the king is starting a march up the board which will be disastrous. 22. f6+ Ke6 23. Ng5+ Kf5 24.	Bd3+	Kxf4 25. Rhg1 and Black's king is caught in a mating net!"

Qe7-c5 is probably the best move but White is still winning as I have e5-e6 at some stage. Notice that now that White has moved the queen from c2 to c7 e5-e6 is no long so good for instance 20. e6 Qxe6 21.	Bxh8	Qe4+ 22. Ka1 Qxf3 and Black is still in the game.

Many authors of opening books will deride this opening almost as if playing it were a criminal offence.  Well I found myself on death row at that before the reprieve came.  It is true the line is very risky possibly even unsound.  But GM Paul Keres used to recommend this line for developing players in order to exercise the (tactical) imagination.  Every now and then I like to try it on for a tactical blow-out.  Boy did I get what I asked for!

But no one played 5...f5 preferring instead 5...Nf6.  But I wanted to get this pawn move in before developing the Knight.  Possibly I was taking more of a risk than I thought!

Yet upon examining the position more closely I came to modify my view.  Black is not having nearly as much fun as I anticipated.  Still the expected 10.dxc5 Bxc5  11.Nb3 looks good for White.

Aron Nimzovitch used to call such a pair a 'hanging pawn couple'.  Their future is certainly suspenseful!

But this gives White use of the centre dark squares.  At this point the GK engine calls it +0.32 (I'll give pluses for White's favour minuses for Black) but I reckon White is doing better than that!

Although it might not look so bad I was already hanging on by my teeth.  Everything depended upon maintaining those advanced pawns and hope that eventually the threat of promotion might yet save the game for Black.  This was the only way to defend them but the price comes high!

As I see it it's almost certain that the black bishop would be exchanged for my knight so I don't have to force it. I wanted to play that before black plays Nbd7 cause then he would have the Qa5 move. Now if the black Queen goes to a5 I will take on f6 and black will have a bad pawn structure. 
374,12,4,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2Pp4/P1P1P3/2Q2PPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Here I had a few extra seconds to decide with wich pawn to take. I saw that if 9. cxd Qa5+ 10. Qd2 Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 Ne4+ and I lose a bishop

379,12,9,Qc7,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/2b1pn1p/8/2BP3B/P1P2P2/2Q1N1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',The treat here is 15. 0-0 Bxf3 16. Rxf3 Qxc4 winning a pawn. So I had to defend or move my bishop. I didn't played Qd3 cause I thought that there would be many pins after some rook goes to d8. So I decided to move the bishop and I needed it to be behind my queen so that I can manage a mate attack or something in the future. Thats why I played it on a2.

However I had thought that I might sacrifice the a4 pawn. It at least means that black had spent one more move with his bishop before placing it on b5. Move that I might use to attack.

At the same time my treat is Bb3. Eventully I might take on a4 and black would have a doubled a pawns. I played my queen on d2 cause I expected g5 to be a clash point. Wait and see. :)

Also that way I join more pieces in my kingside attack. Not to mention that it was doing nothing on d2 cause my e2 knight is enough to defend the c3 pawn.

Black has a number of options here though by far the most common continuation is (as indeed played in the game) 3...a6. Apart from that Black may opt for 3...Nf6 (Berlin Defence) 3...f5 (Jaenitsch Gambit / Schliemann Defence) 3...d6 (Steinitz Defence) 3...Bc5 (Cordel Variation) 3...Nd4 (Bird Defence). Either of these are emininently playable though only the Berlin Defence currently enjoys any real popularity.

For a long time thought to be completely harmless for Black until Bobby Fischer turned it into a dangerous weapon in the 1960s. White has a slight lead in development and a superior pawn structure. Recapturing with the d-pawn opens lines for both queen and bishop significantly lessening the impact of White's development. In principle Black should at least consider a recapture with the b-pawn as the general rule for pawn capture is ""always capture towards the center"". But though correct in its general principle capturing with the b-pawn is hardly recommendable in this specific position. For instance 4...bxc6 5.O-O d6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 c5 8.Qd3 and Black's pawn formation is stymied his development non-existent and his position close to untenable."

In the game position the current main move - and White's most flexible choice - is 5.0-0. Before the days of Bobby Fischer the most common continuation was 5.d4 which offers a considerable simplification of the position."
402,13,5,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White has castled and his position is sound if not very threatening. Black on the other hand has lost the only developed piece he had (Nc6) so that all of his officers are now still on the back rank. However his position is not so bad as all that as he does have the half-open d-file and open lines for his bishops and Queen. What he needs now more than anything else is to keep the position reasonably closed while getting his king whisked away to safety - and he needs to protect his e-pawn too while doing it. There are various ways of achieving this including the unpretentious 5...f6 and the more spectacular but ultimately dubious 5...Bg4 6.h3 h5!?
403,13,6,Qd6,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1pq4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Before the days of computer-assisted opening analysis this move would be regarded as ugly premature foolhardy and a waste of time. Today it is one of the main lines in the Spanish Exchange Variation - though still regarded as ugly. Its redeeming features make up for its unsightliness however: it keeps up pressure on the d-file vacates the back row in preparation for castling long opens up for the possibility of transferring the queen to the king-side in preparation for a K-side attack on White's position and it supports the pawn on e5. A measure of the strength of this move is that White cannot just wrench open the position by 6.d4; Black is fine after 6...exd4 7.Qxd4 Qxd4 8.Nxd4 Bd7.
404,13,7,Na3,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1pq4/4p3/4P3/N4N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Planning to harass Black's queen while preserving the option of opening the center quickly and efficiently by means of d2-d4. Black considered various options here including 6...Qe6 and 6...b5. Of these he evaluated the pawn move as clearly the stronger as it would both restrict the mobility of White's night and expand his control of q-side space. Additionally 6...Qe6 would place both queen and king on the e-file at a time when opening this file would indeed seem to be a possible tactical resource for White. Still 6...Qe6 is playable as demonstrated by Romanishin in his rather nice win against Fiorido: 6...Qe6 7.d4 exd4 8.Nxd4 Qf6 9.Re1 Bd7 10.e5 Qg6 11.e6 fxe6 12.Nc4 O-O-O 13.Bf4 c5 14.Nf3 Bc6 15.Qe2 Qf5 16.Qe3 Nf6 17.Nfe5 Nd5 18.Qa3 Qxf4 19.Nxc6 Qxc4 20.Nxd8 Kxd8 21.Rad1 Bd6 22.Qh3 Nf6 23.b3 Qg4 24.Qe3 Qh5 25.h3 Re8 26.Qd3 Kc8 27.Rd2 e5 28.Rde2 e4 29.Qc3 Qg5 30.Qe3 Qe5 31.g3 Qh5 32.Kg2 Nd5 33.Qd2 Qf3+ 34.Kg1 e3 35.fxe3 Qxg3+ 36.Rg2 Qe5 37.e4 Nf4 38.Rh2 Ng6 39.Rhe2 Nf4 40.Rh2 g5 41.c4 Nd3 {0-1 Fiorido G.

Still this does little to allay the fundamental challenge in Black's position: his precariously placed king. Indeed in some respects the pawn move actually enhances the danger to Black's king: he can no longer rely on castling long which means that White may gain dangerous pressure on his position once the center pawn on e5 has been exchanged. The straightaway advance to d4 is not that dangerous however as Black is fine once the queens have been exchanged off the board: 7.d4 exd4 8.Nxd4 c5 9.Nf3 Qxd1 10.Rxd1 Be6.

But there are problems as well: first and foremost the c-pawn advance to c3 leaves the d-pawn backwards and creates a gaping weakness on d3. This in itself is quite enough to cast the whole Na3 variation into doubt in my mind. The more so as Black has a splendid rejoinder available...

Advancing the d-pawn to d4 will now gain White nothing while Black stands to get rid of his doubled c-pawn weakness. Meanwhile the center is still closed which means Black is not unduly bothered by not having had a chance to castle his King yet. Or stated another way: the closed position negates any significant advantage that White might otherwise have stood to gain from his greater development while Black has achieved already a marked positional advantage by means of the half-open d-file pressure against White's weaknesses on d2 and d3 and his significantly greater mobility on both Q-side and K-side. In a very real sense initiative has now shifted to Black; White just hasn't discovered it yet. On 8.d4 Black will reply 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 c5 after which his mobile Q-side majority gives him the better chances.

The d-pawn stays put the weakness on d3 is now glaringly obvious and the doubled c-pawn actually serves to reinforce Black's Q-side control.

On the other hand the bishop does need to get moved off the 1st rank and it is hardly better placed on b2. Possibly 10.Qe2 is the better move.

Black has almost regained parity in development and anyhow the position is still closed to a significant degree so White's lead in development matters little.

Black either has to move his bishop off the b3 diagonal (thus solving a significant problem for White) or accept being saddled with yet another doubled pawn - and an isolated one at that. However as we have already seen doubled pawns are not always a weakness - and in this case it will serve to give Black an almost immutable lock on the center.

429,13,32,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/3nb1pp/p2qp3/1pp1p3/2P1P3/1P2NP2/RB1P2PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',The pawn on d2 is locked solid; it can advance to d3 and no further. Retracting the Queen will allow Black to remobilize the knight and add more pressure on White's creaking formations. On 19.cxb5 Black gains a clear advantage after 19...axb5 20.Qa1 Rxa2 21.Qxa2 Qxd2.
430,13,33,1Ra5,b'r4rk1/3nb1pp/p2qp3/Rpp1p3/2P1P3/1P2NP2/1B1P2PP/3Q1RK1 b - -',It's difficult to White to find a plan forward so he settles for locking down the Q-side as much as possible.
431,13,34,1b4,b'r4rk1/3nb1pp/p2qp3/R1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P2NP2/1B1P2PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Black wants to keep pressure on the d-file so this makes more sense than trying to reinforce b5. White may in this position want to keep pressure on the a-file in turn in which case Black will have to be precise: 20.Qa1 Bd8! with the idea 21.Ra2 Bc7 and White can no longer prevent Black from relocating his knight: Nd7-b8-c6-d4 as Black may (if required) advance a6-a5 and thus keep his a-pawn covered. An important point in the board postion here - and the reason why Black has to play precisely - is that he does **not** want to open the d-file prematurely. After 20.Qa1 Qxd2?! 21.Ng4 Qc2 22.Qa2 Bd8 23.Bxe5 Qxa2 24.Rxa2 White has equalized and may even have a slight advantage. While 20.Qa1 Bd8 21.Ra2 Qxd2? 22.Bc1! Qd4 23.Qb1 Qd6 24.Rd1 actually hands the d-file -and the advantage - over to White completely!

433,13,36,2Nb8,b'rn3rk1/4b1pp/p2qp3/R1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNP2/1B4PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Black needs to activate the knight. On d7 it is entirely passive besides blocking up the valuable d-file. White's best play here is probably to do the same: Ne3-g4-f2 and Black is left with a very difficult task trying to break through seeing as how White seems able to block the Q-side advance by the simple (though expensive) expedient of placing his rook on a4.
434,13,37,2Qe2,b'rn3rk1/4b1pp/p2qp3/R1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNP2/1B2Q1PP/5RK1 b - -',As an alternative to the g4-f2 knight maneuver White is now able to perform the same relocation by means of d1. The game move has the added advantage of moving the White queen off the d-file and giving room for the rook to take its place there.
435,13,38,2Nc6,b'r4rk1/4b1pp/p1nqp3/R1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNP2/1B2Q1PP/5RK1 w - -',The knight is well placed here and far more active than it was on d7. White should now retreat 22.Ra4 in order to block Black's Q-side ambitions after which 22...Bd8 would probably be imprecise as Black cannot hope to break through on the Q-side while that rook is on a4 which means the bishop is likely to prove of better use on the K-side after all.
436,13,39,2Raa1,b'r4rk1/4b1pp/p1nqp3/2p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNP2/1B2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',The rook retreats too far. It would be better placed on a2 (where it would help cover the 2nd rank and offer the prospect of working together with the rook on f1 in quickly and decisively seizing control of any open file that may present itself) and far better placed on a4.
437,13,40,2a5,b'r4rk1/4b1pp/2nqp3/p1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNP2/1B2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',It is clear for Black that any hopes he may have of winning the game is and must be closely linked with a breakthrough on the Q-side. It is thus important to advance those pawns as far as possible so that the eventual Q-side breakthrough (or even the threat of one) will prove decisive. Thus for instance an immediate 23.Qc2 aiming to block any further advance of the pawn may now be countered by the interesting - and probably decisive - pawn sacrifice 23...a4! 24.bxa4 Rfd8 after which 25.Rfd1 Nd4 26.Bxd4 Qxd4 27.Qf2 b3 should win for Black.
438,13,41,2g3,b'r4rk1/4b1pp/2nqp3/p1p1p3/1pP1P3/1P1PNPP1/1B2Q2P/R4RK1 b - -',White correctly perceives that any active counterplay must happen on the K-side but there is little hope of this advance ever bearing fruit. Black is too well poised in the center for a counterattack on the flank to have any perceivable chance of success.
439,13,42,2Bg5,b'r4rk1/6pp/2nqp3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1P3/1P1PNPP1/1B2Q2P/R4RK1 w - -',Preparing to take advantage of the open lines in White's camp while blocking any ideas White may have about advancing the f-pawn. Now interesting complications arise after 24.Ng4 Nd4 on which 25.Qd1 h5 26.Nf2 Nxf3+ 27.Kg2 where the sharp rejoinder 27...Nd2!? is probably premature due to 28.Re1 Rf3 29.Qxf3!? Nxf3 30.Kxf3 with an unclear position. Black is ahead on points but may find it very difficult to break through. Less good for White is 25.Bxd4?! Qxd4+ 26.Qf2 Qxd3 27.Qxc5 Rxf3 28.Rxf3 Qxf3 and White's position is in shambles.
440,13,43,2Ng2,b'r4rk1/6pp/2nqp3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1P3/1P1P1PP1/1B2Q1NP/R4RK1 b - -',Prudent. The knight is an important defender and control of e3 is vital for White.
441,13,44,2Nd4,b'r4rk1/6pp/3qp3/p1p1p1b1/1pPnP3/1P1P1PP1/1B2Q1NP/R4RK1 w - -',White's 23rd move (g3) now looks like serious mistake; rather than vitalizing White's K-side it now reveals itself as a near-fatal weakening of the important pawn on f3. If that pawn could advance the weakness may have been turned to a strength ... but it can't. And because it can't escape the pressure being levelled against it it threatens to bring the whole edifice crashing down round White's king. Black's knight magnificantly poised on d4 commands the whole board. The threat against b3 has to be replied to and retreating the queen to d1 to cover it is inadvisable as Black can simply pile up pressure on the f-file until something gives eg.: 25.Qd1 Rf7 26.f4 Raf8 27.fxg5 Rxf1+ 28.Qxf1 Rxf1+ 29.Rxf1 Nxb3 and Black wins.
442,13,45,2Bxd4,b'r4rk1/6pp/3qp3/p1p1p1b1/1pPBP3/1P1P1PP1/4Q1NP/R4RK1 b - -',Thus White is compelled to this exchange

White cannot move the King away as 26.Kh1 Rfd8 27.Rfd1 Qc3 28.Rab1 a4! 29.bxa4 Rxa4 gives Black the Q-side breakthrough he needs to win. Additionally White cannot block with the rook: 26.Rf2 Rfd8 27.Rd1 a4 28.f4 a3! is a clear win for Black (29.fxg5 a2 etc.).
444,13,47,2Qf2,b'r4rk1/6pp/4p3/p1p1p1b1/1pPqP3/1P1P1PP1/5QNP/R4RK1 b - -',Black has succeeded in denuding d3 of defenders but he cannot take immediate advantage of that: capturing the pawn now would be premature as 26...Qxd3 allows 27.Qxc5! with complications eg.: 27...Qxb3 28.Qxe5 Be3+ 29.Nxe3 Qxe3+ 30.Kh1 Qb6 (Black must cover the pawn on e6 or hand the center over to White entirely) 31.Rfd1 and White has counterplay though Black is still better.
445,13,48,2Qxf2+,b'r4rk1/6pp/4p3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1P3/1P1P1PP1/5qNP/R4RK1 w - -',The 'intuitive' reply here would be to recapture with the rook. It would also be ... wrong. White needs to capture with the King here even if it does place the king in an exposed position entering a half-open center and looking down the throat of a hostile rook with only a weak pawn as shield. But if he doesn't - if he captures with the rook instead - his monarch is going to turn out to be too far away from the Q-side pawns to be able to avert the disaster looming there. Only by capturing with his king getting that one vital step closer to the front can he equalize the game now. Let's look at some lines: 27.Kxf2! Rf7 28.Ra4 Raf8 29.Ke2 (29.Ne1 Bd2!) 29...Bd8 and White has equalized. Or 27...Bd2!? 28.Ke2! Bc3 29.Ra4 and Black cannot break through (and likewise any attempt by White to open the center will free Black's bishop to range the board again). That said this line actually does represent Black's best attempt at a win as White has to play rather exactly to ensure equality. For instance 28.Ra2?! Bc3 29.Ke2 a4 30.bxa4 Ra5 31.Kd1 Rfa8 32.Kc2 Rxa4 33.Rxa4 Rxa4 and Black has a clear advantage. Or 28.Ne3 Bc3 29.Ra2 a4 30.bxa4 Ra5 31.Nd1 Bd4+ 32.Ke2 Rfa8 33.Nb2 Bxb2 34.Rxb2 Rxa4 and Black should win.
446,13,49,2Rxf2,b'r4rk1/6pp/4p3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1P3/1P1P1PP1/5RNP/R5K1 b - -',On first blush this has several advantages on the king capture: it prepares for a doubling of the rooks on either the a- or f-file and it enhances the collective mobility of the rooks. True there is a potential weakness insofar as the king and the rook are now on the same diagonal but the knight on g2 serves well to guard against Black placing his bishop on e3 to fork the rook. The actual problem with 27.Rxf2 is less obvious - as detailed in the previous annotation: the king remains on the g-file and without influence on the central and Q-side scenes.
447,13,50,2Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4p3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1P3/1P1P1PP1/5RNP/R5K1 w - -',Black takes immediate advantage. The bishop on g5 prevents the f2 rook from entering the defence of the weak pawn on d3 and the rook on a1 cannot move away from the a-file or Black will break through with an immediate a5-a4. And the knight of course cannot move either or Black will win the exchange by means of Bg4-e3.
448,13,51,2f4,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4p3/p1p1p1b1/1pP1PP2/1P1P2P1/5RNP/R5K1 b - -',White has prepared for those problems however and after this advance everything seems fine. More than fine actually as White gains both initiative and a slight advantage after 28...exf4 29.gxf4 Bh6 30.Rf3: any activity Black may wish to initiate on the Q-side is easily neutralized by a thrust by White's now very mobile e- and f-pawns.
449,13,52,2Bf6,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4pb2/p1p1p3/1pP1PP2/1P1P2P1/5RNP/R5K1 w - -',Unfortunately for White Black does not have to capture on f4...

452,13,55,3Rxf4,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4pb2/p1p5/1pP1PR2/1P1P2P1/6NP/3R2K1 b - -',Forced but unfortunate: moving away from the 2nd rank gives Black the option of boxing it out of the game for now.
453,13,56,3Bd4+,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4p3/p1p5/1pPbPR2/1P1P2P1/6NP/3R2K1 w - -',Blocks off the important f2 square preventing the rook from reentering the game there. Nor can the king take advantage of the chance to come back again: 31.Kf1 e5! 32.Rf3 a4 33.bxa4 Rxa4 34.Ke2 (even worse: 34.Ne3 Bxe3 35.Rxe3 Rf8+ 36.Ke1 Ra2 37.Rd2 b3 38.Ree2 Ra1+ 39.Rd1 Rxd1+ 40.Kxd1 Rf1+ 41.Kd2 b2 and White can resign) 34...Ra2+ 35.Rd2 Rxd2+ 36.Kxd2 Ra8 37.Ne1 Bc3+ 38.Kd1 Ra1+ and wins.

Precise play is required though should White go for the complications arising from 32.Rff1!? to which Black's best reply is 32...axb3 (closer analysis reveals that it is a required feature of the position that Black can keep White's knight away from c2: with the knight posted there the a-pawn cannot queen) 33.Nf4 Rd6 34.Rb1 b2 35.Ne2 Be5 after which 36.d4!? fails to 36...cxd4 37.c5 Rc6 and the rook cannot capture the intrepid pawn on b2 due to d4-d3.
456,13,59,3bxa4,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4p3/2p5/PpPbPR2/3P2P1/6NP/3R3K b - -',Black must not succumpt to the temptation and mindlessly reply 32...Rxa4: a waste of time which might cost him the very victory he has worked so hard to ensure. The endgame is quite complex for instance: 32...Rxa4 33.Rb1 Ra3 34.Rf3 Be5 35.Ne1 b3 36.d4 Bxd4 37.Rfxb3 and White has equalized. Or 34.Ne1 (instead of 34.Rf3) 34...b3 35.Rf1 b2 36.Nc2 Be5 37.Kg2 d4 (not 38.Kf3 Ra1 39.Nxa1 bxa1=Q 40.Rxa1 Rxa1 and Black has won) 38.d4! Bxd4 39.Nxd4 cxd4 40.Rxb2 with complex play.
457,13,60,3b3,b'r2r2k1/6pp/4p3/2p5/P1PbPR2/1p1P2P1/6NP/3R3K w - -',With this (temporary) pawn sacrifice Black wins an extremely important tempo. The advanced b-pawn restricts White's options significantly. Thus 33.Rb1 b2 34.Rff1 Rxa4 35.Nf4 Rda8 36.Nxe6 Ra1 37.Nxd4 Rxb1 38.Rxb1 Ra1 and Black wins. Or 33.Ne1 Rxa4 34.Nf3 Be3!! (prevents the bishop from being captured forces the rook off the f-file and deeper into obscurity and prevents the knight from reentering the game through d2) 35.Rg4 b2 36.Rb1 Ra1 and Black wins.

459,13,62,3e5,b'r2r2k1/6pp/8/2p1p3/P1PbP3/1p1P2P1/6NP/3R1R1K w - -',Keeps the knight out of the game and the wonderfully centralized bishop keeps a1 under tight control. White could try to bring the knight back with 34.Rb1 b2 35.Ne1 but Black will counter with 35...Bc3 36.Rf3 Rxa4 37.Nc2 Rda8 38.Rff1 Ra1 39.Nxa1 bxa1=Q 40.Rxa1 Rxa1 and Black wins.
460,13,63,3Ne1,b'r2r2k1/6pp/8/2p1p3/P1PbP3/1p1P2P1/7P/3RNR1K b - -',The central point of Black's play: with the pawn still on b3 the knight still cannot move on to c2 and thus remains locked out of the battle. As an added benefit (from Black's point of view) it now disrupts the communication between the rooks as well. Black may consider simply capturing the a4 pawn now as 34...Rxa4 35.Nf3 Bc3 36.Rc1 Rxd3 37.Kg2 Rxc4 is clearly won.

1-0
An impressive defeat of the champion of the Old World! This game lasted all of half an hour. After gaining revenge on the 77th move in the very next game Anderssen joked gloomily: ""Morphy wins in 17 moves whereas it takes me 77. However this is still bearable..."" By winning the 11th game Morphy won the match (+7 -2 =2) and thus in just one year he had clearly demonstrated that he had no equal in the world.
""Morphy possesses the secret of invincibility"" the newspapers enthused. The loser of the match although shocked also worthily assessed his opponent's immense triumph publicly declaring that Morphy played much more strongly and solidly than La Bourdonnais and admitting: ""It is useless fighting against this man; for me he is too strong. He is accurate and faultless like a machine whereas I am only a mere mortal..."" Later Anderssen shared a very important observation: ""Morphy treats chess with the seriousness and conscientiousness of an artist...For him a game of chess is a sacred duty...""
Before Morphy left Paris a splendid farewell banquet was held in his honor. To the applause of the public the chairman Saint-Amant crowned with a laurel wreath a marble bust specially made for the occasion of the ""king of all kings"" which became one of the sights of the Cafe de la Regence.
Paul was greeted even more triumphantly in New York. An official celebration in his honor took place in a hall seating two thousand where enormous shields were erected with the names of his defeated opponents. When Morphy appeared a hymn was played; then the chess king was presented with a gift from the nation - a rosewood table encrusted with pearl and silver a chess board with squares of mother-of-pearl and ebony with gold and silver pieces on cornelian pedestals...He was also presented with a gold clock with diamonds where the hours were indicated by red and black chess pieces. For the first time in chess history a victory was truly recognized as an event of national importance!
What was the secret to Morphy's invincibility? I think that it was a combination of a unique natural talent and brilliant erudition. His play was the next more mature stage in the development of chess. Morphy had a well-developed ""feeling for position"" and therefore he can be confidently regarded as the ""first swallow"" -- the prototype of the strong 20-th century GM.
Like Philidor a hundred or so years before him Morphy was GREATLY ahead of his time. As Euwe put it: ""If the distinguishing feature of a genius is that he is far ahead compared with his epoch then Morphy was a chess genius in the complete sense of the word."" He spontaneously established the three main principles of opening play: 1) the rapid development of the pieces; 2) the seizure of the center; 3) the opening of lines. To formulate these and other principles of positional play required a furth"

As the knight on d7 is pinned and the pin is very hard to get out of maybe Qd2 is even stronger - still keeping an eye on the knight on f4 but also perhaps preparing to gang up on the knight on d7 with Ra1-d1 and if Black allows it Nf3-e5. I think in some variations pressure on d7 can be stepped up with Nc4-b6 too. Black is quite tied up here already!

720,24,36,1Nfe5,b'r2qk2r/1bbn1p2/4p2p/pBB1N3/PpN1Pnp1/2P1Q3/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',This is by far the best move white could have played in this position. White now has two pieces attacking the knight on d7. 19..... Bc8 is the only way to fight on although white has a huge advantage now - she has handled this off-beat and tricky defence by Black very well indeed.

For one thing vote games are very reliant on the active participation by the voting side - and a willingness to discuss their plans. When bigpeta's coaching club was still going I was invited to play against the team of club members. The result was this game as annotated by hogfysshe. It was a tough even game until deep in the end game when a very subtle oversight tipped the balance. 
gameknot.com 
At move 9 you will find in the comments a link to the club forum thread with all the discussions.  This current game...
Started out as a 'Bishop's Opening' and old fashioned line that has I believe undergone a little bit of a revival since GM Bent Larsen's experiments with it in the 1960s. Black has played a species of Hungarian defence against it (the DSB's development on e7 rather than a fianchetto bu ...g6 and ...Bg7). As White has yet to mobilise the Q-side and there is no other compelling plan that suggests itself I'd probably be inclined to bring out the minor pieces 7.Nc3 say. 

But where should the bishop go subsequently? Be3 suggests itself but Black might then play ...Ng4. Do we want to exchange B for N on e3 (losing the 'minor exchange' and doubling e-pawns but strengthening the centre and opening the f-file). If this is unattractive then we either develop the bishop to d2 or pre-empt a Black minor piece's incursion at g4 by h2-h3. 

But that can wait upon 7.Nc3. 

A whole different plan does occur to me here though which involves a breakout in the centre: 7.c3; 8.Re1; 9.d4. Is this playable?  riaannieman: I suggest b2 b4. That is a start to attacking the knight on c6  redfox17: vote game 1 vote for b2 h4 has been suggested. I suggest h3 it prevents Bg4 pin on our knight on f3.

Chess is turned based but you can look ahead in your games. This is just 1 line from projected move 7 by black.  riaanieman: I think we should start to develop the assets
We have much firepower still stationary and it should be developed. To do that we need to create some space in the middle. I would like to see the center cleared of opposition therefor I suggest to move the pawn on c2 forward to c3. My tactic would be to move the pawn on d3 to d4 therefore forcing an exchange and thus gaining control of the center. Now we would have room to move those assets at the back forward and take control of the game. 

The position of the king in that ally behind the pawns seems very dangerous to me. I have used that many times to clinch a game. If you force the king towards the corner it is trapped and ready for mate by a rook or queen. Those three pawns should be set up to give the king some protection space to move out of danger and at the same time foil an attack from that side. It is something to keep it mind as a secondary priority. I like to have an asset such as the knight or rook in position there to assist the king. 

In my experience and tactics we should also start thinking of exchanging stronger assets besides the exchange of pawns in the center which should be advantageous to us. If you know your opponent one could exchange our least favorite asset for a favored one of his for example a knight for a bishop or bishop for bishop. This is something to consider later.  archduke_piccolo: Black's potential responses...
Can I just say here that the proper time to discuss these would really have been before we played our 7th move. just sayin'...   

Black's most likely move is 7...0-0 for two reasons. Rather than play a minor piece to b4 right now Black might want to wait a move to see what we intend for instance to move the Q-side bishop to e3 when Black MIGHT consider ...Ng4 in reply (He might not too). In addition it places the K in a safe spot and brings out the rook. 

If Black were now to play 7...Bg4 (threatening 8...Nd4) how should we respond? I'd be quite happy to strike at the bishop by 8.h3 but what if 8...Bh5? Well we could try 9.g4 but I'm pretty uncomfortable with that sort of move. When it is good it is usually very good indeed but often it can be cripplingly weakening. We would have to be very confident of our prospects I think before playing such a move. Still the upside is that after 9...Bg6 the bishop is for the time being locked in so I wouldn't rule it out by any means. 

I'd probably be more inclined though (after 7...Bg4 8.h3 Bh5) to play 9.Nbd2 and then work on unpinning the f3-knight (Qe1 say or c3 then Q"

... are the possible moves ...Bg4 and ...Be6. He might even be considering playing 9...Bg4 10.h3 Be6. If we play 9.h3 now then I think 9...Be6 would be a very likely response. Something to think about. 

My candidate moves (in no particular order of preference): 
8.h3 
8.Be3 
8.Nc3 
But I am open to other suggestions (8.c3; 8.Bd2 even 8.Re1 say seem reasonable).  riaannieman: Your first choice is also mine
Yes I think h3. That would have been my vote. However I am also keeping in mind my earlier suggestion: the center needs to be taken control of or at least opened up for our assets to be developed. To me that is pressing harder and harder; very soon we would have to do something about it (but not immediately).  redfox17: vote game
I see 2 candidate moves in addition to h3 from Ion 
1 vote also from Riaan for h3 and I like h3 

3 votes for h3 and was played as requested. 

We should attempt to suggest new possible moves prior to what black may play.  archduke_piccolo: Just to be clear...
I probably would have preferred 8.Nc3 but in my view there was not enough among the 3 'candidates' I suggested to come down hard and fast on any of them. 8.h3 just happened to be the first I noted down. But the pawn move is fine and does narrow Black's range of options. 

At this point I am half-expecting Black to play 8...Be3 to which I suggest 9.Nbd2 or 9.Nc3. I remain however open to other suggestions. (I would not object to 9.Be3 for instance). 

Against anything else I'm inclined to take a 'wait and see' attitude. Black has no immediate threats that I can see so we can here afford to wait."

Black I think will play Be6 leaves us 2 moves that are developing moves Nc3 and Be3 not in this order. Anyways lets Black make his move. We can then make our votes as to what we think is best and why. 

The game is even piece wise but white is not developed as much as black.  riaannieman: I agree
Black will probably play Be6. I don't think it wise to exchange assets at his insistence and think we should try to 'inconvenience' him and try something unexpected. If he doesn't mind losing the bishop he may put more value in the abilities of the knight and those would then be my target. Let us see how that develops. 

If he doesn't move that bishop I see him developing the queen side at this time. That would have been my strategy. So I am thinking in the line of moving that pawn of ours on b4 up one and backing it with the pawn on a3. 

So I have two options in mind when we get to it. It all depends on the next move by black. "

I thought 8...Be6 much more likely but this pawn advance possibly heralding 9...b5 did cross my mind. As I didn't think it imposed on White in any way I didn't comment. It is just possible Black is thinking in terms of developing the QB via b7. 

We might as well then develop our Q-side - Nc3 and/or Be3. Normally one develops knights before bishops on any given side but this is no cast iron rule. We might want the QN to develop at d2 in which case I'd prefer to move B-K3 (Be3) first. Mind you 9.Nbd2 and 10.Bb2 is a playable enough sequence. I'd be prepared to go along with that. 

My own preference is for the straightforward 9.Nc3 but there isn't much in it.  redfox17: vote game
We have some extra time as Dave set vacation flag for 3 days and he has 33 games total in play. 
So we can continue to discuss things until he takes his time off. Could also see if anyone else is interested in helping us with move suggestions and discussions.  riaannieman: My suggestion
I suggest to move that pawn on b4 forward and then get it backed up by the pawn on a3. After that we need to develop our assets in a hurry; we are at a tactical disadvantage because we have no mobile assets yet.  archduke_piccolo: Let's look at 9.b5...
It is possible that Black had reason to apprehend that move so 8...a6 was less a waiting move than a preventive one. For mine b5 is not a move that comes to mind right away but if it had served (or serves now) to disrupt Black's game then it is worth thinking about. 

9.b5!? axb5 
10.Bxb5 Bd7 (This seems to be the move most called for here...) 
11.a4!? ... 
I wonder if we really would want to play 11.a4 at this point. The pawn isolated as it is seems to me better placed on a3 but stand to persuaded to a different view. Shouldn't we rather play one of the unmoved minor pieces instead? 

Having said that I feel that Black is by no means inconvenienced by this sequence and we might have harmed our own game - not by much but something we might be better avoiding. We would be left with an isolated flank pawn on a file half-open to Black's rook(s). 

Riaan has indicated we ought to get our Q side mobilized quickly and I agree. It is probably better not to wait upon 9.b5 but shovel B and N out now-ish: 9.Nc3  redfox17: Vote looking at 9.
9. b5 does attack the knight which can then advance forward gaining tempo for Black. 
9. Nc3 is a developing move for us gaining us the tempo. 
I would not develop our DSB yet Our Queen can also wait to be moved at this time. 
Looking at the game Fen diagram we have followed the basic rules of development. We have only moved our developing pieces 1 move each. We have castled getting our King safer.We have not moved out our Queen early in the game prior to minor piece development. 

My vote for 9. is Nc3.  archduke_piccolo: I ought to have added...

In my opinion we should have frustrated the efforts to exchange until we are satisfied it will gain us a strategic advantage. That will not happen now. Unfortunately the exchange will happen no matter what. Our next option is to make the exchange in such a manner as to gain us the most advantage. Will attacking the opposing bishop where it is now be the best? Should we let him attack and make the exchange closer to 'home base'? Is it an option to ignore the pending exchange and launch another option? 

We need to create some space somehow. Usually I would use the paws for that.  redfox17: Vote game

10. Nd5 Bb2 Bd5 

these moves will let us wait and see what black does.  riaannieman: 
  What happens if we take the opposing bishop?
If we take the opposing bishop I think his only option to exchange is using the pawn. Will that create an opportunity for us? The line towards the rook and king at the back is open.....  redfox17: Vote game
Click on the Fen diagram to analyze. I took Bishop and looked at counter play by black taking with pawn which doubles up pawns. I also looked at not taking back the piece. Eventually I retreated the Bishop. The question is would this really happen? What do you see happening with 10.Nd5? 
I Think Black would bring out his Queen. The other candidate move was developing our basline Bishop to b2 or d5. Lets keep up our discussion you never know if someone might give some further assistance. At this point lets put on our thinking caps and look out a few moves. That is most hard when you reach a delicate position. We want to come out ahead with an advantage.  archduke_piccolo: Big think time...
I had half an idea that our 9th move would 'induce' this bishop move by Black. It was certainly on the cards. What should we do then? We can: 
1. Exchange on e6. Reasonable but let's see if we can't do better. 
2. Move the bishop and permit its exchange on another square (e.g. 10.Bd5). 
3. Play something else and allow the c4-bishop to be exchanged on its present square. The move 10.Be3 comes to mind with 10....Bxc4 11.dxc4 likely to follow. 
4.Block the line of the confronting bishops viz: 10.Nd5. 

What I'll do now is carry out a 'Karpov' style evaluation of the position. I won't be doing this often!. During its course I'll touch on the alternatives I have suggested. 

Evaluation: 
1. Material relationship: 
Dead even. Early days. 

2. Presence of direct threats: 
If you think of the likely exchange of bishops on c4 or e6 as a 'direct threat' there isn't anything much imminent. 

3. King position and their safety: 
Both Kings safely castled short; both 'castles'"

 I think e Pawn takes pawn on d5 is my vote. 11. exd5  archduke_piccolo: Agreed.
I rather thought - or second thought - Black might play this advance. I don't think it really matters all that much how we take on d5 but take we really should. I prefer the pawn capture as it 'forks' two Black minor pieces and carries on the exchanges. So we should probably be prepared to exchange two pairs of minor pieces to follow: 

11.exd5 Nxd5 
12.Nxd5 Bxd5 
13.Bxd5 Qxd5 
... 
What to play at this point? We should probably decide now as such a decision would inform us whether or not to pursue all three moves of exchanges. I quite like 14.c4 even though it seems to leave the d-pawn backward and weak. I think that after the Q moves we can look at the 15.d4 break.

I agree with the proposal. We exchange assets and the queen moves up which I like. We just have to make sure about the tactics after that. What are we going to do? We need to explore our future tactics.

I was thinking 14.c4 as well. There is a downside to the move that we should think about though. That is the d-pawn that is being left backward and weak. If we let that sit Black will no doubt pile pressure on the thing. Probably we can hold but I would prefer not to be forced to do so. So I am considering following up the c4 advance with the immediate 15.d4 break. 

This is likely to result in the further exchange of a minor piece but what we are left with is a late middle game with symmetrical pawn formations. Our winning prospects are vanishingly small I accept but I do like our prospects of keeping the draw.  "

White to play 

My candidate Vote is to take with our Bishop 16. Bxd4 


If we take using our Knight I think Black could attack with his BISHOP to f6 and would have 3 attacking pieces the d4 square. 
That is why I think taking Bxe4 is best and is my vote for 16. Bxd4  archduke_piccolo: Good point...
Something we have to consider very carefully. 

The concern I would have with taking 16.Bxd4 is that after 16...Nxd4 17.Qxd4 Qxd4 18.Nxd4 we would be facing an endgame with knight against bishop on an open board. Objectively such an ending ought probably to be tenable but it would not be easy! The bishop is much more mobile and would have an edge - enough to keep us on the hop - in the ensuing game. One thing for sure: we should be reluctant to exchange more than one pair of rooks subsequently though the exchange of minor pieces would (in general) suit us. The symmetrical pawn formation and large numbers of pawns would probably favour our survival at any rate though I would have preferred the Q-side to be less far advanced! 

I think I might have a tactical answer to 16.Nxd4 Bf6 at least to the threat it carries but I'll leave it for youse guys to test out for the next oh shall we say 24 hours or so? 

This is where we will have to calculate actual moves and sequences of moves. The question is is 16.Nxd4 playable? How playable? If we find that it won't do then we can at least fall back on the 16.Bxd4 line.  riaannieman: I like the advanced queen side. I think it creates opportunities.  I don't think we should exchange assets now. Set up a stronger attack. That pawn will stay right where it is for now. In my opinion we are in a bad strategic position and we will lose what little we have. We have two static rooks- get them moving first. 

I am also thinking of doing something unexpectedly like advancing the pawn on b4 to get that knight out of there. Obviously the pawn will be taken but exchanging with our other pawn still puts that knight under pressure. We will first need to get the queen side rook covered by the another asset instead of the queen. 

The proposed exchange on d4 will force our queen to keep on covering for a while effectively pinning her down. 

I don't follow the long discussion and explanation yet; let me go over it slowly on my chess board.  archduke_piccolo: Can I say this though: we really must recapture the pawn on d4. Recall that right at the moment we are a pawn down and if we don't restore the balance at once we'll stay a pawn down with very problematical chances of saving the game. Further mobilization will have to wait. 

If we do give up (cede) material we must have somethng for it in terms of time and/or space. We have no such advantages to justify letting the pawn go. So right now only two move come into serious consideration (as far as I can see): 16.Nxd4 and 16.Bxd4. 

If you want to minimise exchanges then after 16.Nxd4 Nxd4 we could retake with the bishop 17.B"

I will update the board with the current position. I'm like the manager or coach for this team game and I can let everyone know if we lose it's my fault. Anyways the game is not lost It will most likely have faster exchanges.  archduke_piccolo: Too bad...
... we'll just have to take our lumps. 

It is very likely Black will play 16...Nxd4 whereat our choice (to maintain the material status quo) will be between 17.Nxd4 and 17.Qxd4. 

What I have to say at this point is 'first pass' - I am very open to correction here. My preference will be to take with the knight (if we can) effectively enquiring of Black if he wants to keep the Queens on. If he replies (to 17.Nxd4) with 17...Bf6 then 18.Nf3 will one way or another preserve our a1-rook. 

The reason for not offering the Queen exchange ourselves has to do with timing. If we play 17.Qxd4 then 17...Qxd4 18.Nxd4 Rfd8 (say) 19.Nf3 and Black achieves control over the d-file. If we take with the knight then 17.Nxd4 Rad8 18.Nf3 and now if 18...Qxd1 (unlikely but suppose) 19.Rfxd1 Rxd1ch 20.Rxd1 and White has control over the d-file. 

Black will not want that to happen of course but at worst (it seems to me right now) we will be better placed to challenge Black's possession of the central files. "

I am feeling more strongly about that knight as the game goes along. I think we should try to keep it safe for the end game where it would probably be put to good use more so than a bishop. 

My suggestion is to start moving the rook on f1 now. I propose to get it moving towards the white queen trying to skewer her in front of another rook or even better the king. The other option that I think of is the three pawns on a-c which still holds some promise is we can move one of them past the enemy lines and force white to sacrifice a good asset to prevent us from promoting. We may be able to get out of such an exchange one up if we plan it correctly. I believe if we use the rooks in concert we will be able achieve that."

We just need to play carefully.  riaannieman: I see it that way as well
It seems to be the most obvious play  archduke_piccolo: I must admit...
... to being a little bit concerned that Black might play this. It is an attempt to win a pawn 9...axb4; axb4 Bxb4) or else split our Q-side (bxa5). That they can become targets can be the problem with advanced pawns in the ending. That does not prohibit such advances of course; merely indicates that care is needed. 

In the line suggested by redfox17 I think he has forgotten the BQ stands unprotected. But at least gives us something to work on. 

redfox's idea of moving the knight makes sense. I don't (much) like 18.bxa5 here as it leaves our pawns split and isolated. If it turns out to be our best move then we should certainly play it. But a knight move exploiting the BQ's lack of immediate protection should give us time to counter Black's threat against our Q-side. We ought at kleast to consider it. 

17.Nc2 ... I had not previously considered myself but it looks reasonable if maybe a little passive. It does gain us a wee bit of time. Black must choose between [a] exchanging queens [b] protecting his Queen or [c] moving his Queen. 

After 17...Qxd1 18.Rfxd1 Bf6 19.Rb1 ... (I'd be a bit worried about leaving the rook loose on a2) 19... axb4 20.axb4 ... (I'll leave youse guys and gals to check out the alternative recaptures...) 20...Ra2. 
The establishment of a Black rook on our second rank would be a development not to our liking methinks. 

Instead 17...Rfd8 18.Qxd7(?!) Rxd7 19.Rfd1 Rad8 20.Rxd7 Rxd7and although White can pick up the a-pawn (21.bxa5) 21...Rd2 in combination with ...Bc5 or maybe ...Bf6 probably more than compensates Black for his (temporary) pawn deficit. 

Of the possible Q-moves it is hard to pick which Black might play: ...Qf5 ...Qe6 ...Qc6 ...Qa4. Of these 17...Qc6 seems likely enough: 
17...Qc6 18.Qe2 Bf6 19.Rb1 axb4 20.axb4 ... (20.Nxb4 Qa4) 20...Ra2.

If I was black I would try to save the queen for now and exchange later when there will be an advantage afterwards. However I can't predict with certainty what black will do; it seems that the majority opinion is an exchange with white. 

I thought that our move 18 would be rb1 but instead it was kb5. I'm not sure what to do next. There is a little attack on our pawn on b5 which I can't see us getting out of ahead. If we retaliate and exchange the pawns on b5 our rook is vulnerable and will most probably be taken. If we don't retaliate we are 1 down and at this stage in the game will be fatal. 

Our best hope is to position the knight to make the most of an opportunity later. It may be that we can force black to position the king and a rook in a position for a nice fork with our knight. I think the possibility of a pawn 'push' on a-c is now gone.  archduke_piccolo: I think...
... things might be getting away from us a bit. I hadn't quite yet voted for 18.Nb5 merely stated that was where I was leaning. I think I would have voted that way though. 

But I was hoping others would get in their arguments before we made a decision. 

Rather belatedly let's revisit 18.Rb1. Before doing so I should mention I looked at redfox17's continuation and simply forgot to go back to Riann's original idea. It is easy to see the motivations behind it. For one thing it obviates any pin along the dark long diagonal (a1-h8). But it also beefs up the defences on b4. How might the game then proceed? 

18.Rb1 axb4 
19.axb4 ... 
Only option: 19.Rxb4 loses the exchange after ...Bxb4. 
At this point a small tactical idea comes to mind: 

19...Bxb4 
20.Rxb4 c5 
Forking rook and knight. Does this mean Black wins a pawn? Let's continue: 

21.Rb5 ... 
Now if 21...cxd4 22.Rd5 looks awkward for Black to meet. But how about... 

21...Qxd4 
22.Qxd4 cxd4 
23.Rd5 Rfd8 
24.Rd1 Rxd5 
25.cxd5 Ra4. 
Although this line isn't definitive it seems to indicate Black might come out of 18.Rb1 with a little bit of an edge and maybe gets to win and keep an extra pawn.  riaannieman: Sorry I am out of ideas for now. I really don't know what to do. I will follow the suggestion of the better players and try to understand. At this stage of the game if I was playing alone I probably would have lost quickly.

I - we - should still value your input. Whether your suggestions are good or not so good I think you will find the exercise more valuable if you do come up with your own ideas. 

In my view your previous suggestion (Rb1) was quite plausible and worth investigating. We were too inclined to pass over it I think. Sorry about that. 

Having said that this game is turning out to be not so easy to play. There isn't much concrete upon which to fasten a plan and the game being symmetrical and balanced (barring the minor pieces remaining). But that is all the more reason t"

You are right in everything you said and it was indeed my intention just as you describe. It's just that I am out of ideas right now. I'm sure I will spot something soon..... I will say so when I spot it. Usually at this time of the game I will move without aim just getting my assets together and covering each other until I can formulate a new plan. This will be interesting to watch now.  archduke_piccolo: @Riann...
I can understand that. I'm not finding it an easy matter to find moves here nor accurately to predict Black's responses. Well I can but only because I am canvassing multiple moves. 

Black has just played 18...Qc6. I considered this about as likely as Q exchanges but you will see that I spent more time discussing the latter. But that was because the exchange led to lines more easily calculated. 

Black's move threatens two of our pawns the c- and the b-pawns. Faced with this sort of thing we look for: 
a] Direct defence 
b] Indirect defence 
c] Counter-play/ counter threats. 

Here the most obvious - and it looks like the only - direct defence for both pawns is 19.Qb3. A counter threat worth looking at might be 19.Qe2 attacking the Bishop. At the moment (I'm in a bit of a hurry) I can't find anything that might constitute an indirect defence. 

Perhaps I should explain that concept. 'Indirect defence' involves methods that whilst permitting a capture imposes a cost upon it. Immediate recapture is simply 'direct defence'. 'Indirect' is less straightforward.  jkarp: I like unrated club games. But I was inspired by ION himself since I was there in the WTWLTR Club. And it was the first time I saw an unrated club game. Then as I saw more in that club I did more of that in my club. So without further adue as it is hard to find a good move I have a very slight preference for Qd6 as there is some pressure on the d file and while no biggie we have the h pawn pinned. Again I don't know what the best move and I thought of a good move before this. But the move I vote appears better and as they say ""When you think you have found a good move look for something better.""  archduke_piccolo: Joe...

We take back pawn and he may take our a1 rook which we recapture. 
Then we just need to be sure to protect our knight. 

The end game is our Knight against a DSB. If the queens come off this will be a hard game for us. 

What do we want do do for move 20. that is our next move. Any one can post a current fen diagram if they need it to decide the next move.  archduke_piccolo: I think the situation here is clear cut: we must retake the pawn. 

My vote: 20.axb4 

I don't mind if Black exchanges a pair of rooks - don't mind (in principle) if all the rooks come off. If we get into a Q+N vs Q+B endgame we'll be doing reasonably well. The reason is the Q and N complement each other very well in end games. In such an ending Q/B will have a slight edge in mobility but the Q/N will generally be the handier (especially as the bishop's influence will be on one colour of squares). 

Having said that would Black be willing to shed all the rooks? I think he might exchange one pair but maybe not the other. 

One thing I would suggest: that if the exchange of Queens is in prospect that we should look to get something extra (not necessarily material) to sweeten the deal for us. Or of course we should have to accept the swap if that is the only way to avoid incurring a worse outcome. 

So all other things being equal: 
I'll be happy to exchange rooks; 
I'll be happy to exchange minor pieces (bishop for knight); 
I'll be happy to exchange pawns; 
I'll not be so happy to exchange Queens. 

All if this might indicate a plan for Black: to force the Queens (if not all the major pieces) off the board. Note...
... that what I have said above is not cast in stone. Circumstances may well arise in which the relative values change. If you played through the line I posted In parentheses on 1st May you will see that Black offers to exchange rook for knight and is later even prepared (apparently) to give up a whole rook. Whether the 'exchange sacrifice' would have been sound I don't know for sure but so sound is the subsequent rook 'sacrifice' it is no sacrifice at all. redfox17: Vote game 20 axb4

That is my vote 21. Rf1xRa1  riaannieman: 
Oh boy the time zones.....
I wanted to propose that we delay the exchange of pawns but the decision and move was made while I was sleeping. I also wanted to argue against the exchange of rooks at this time; I am perfectly happy to exchange but I wanted to force the exchange at a time and place where we would be left with a tactical advantage. To me this exchange was not in our best strategic interest right now. We have no option but to retake that opposing rook. This takes the initiative away form us and we will now be kept running for a while. We are now on the back foot but we don't have another choice. 

Exchange then. It is inevitable. I doubt that black will willingly exchange the other rook as well. 

What is going to follow will be more or less predictable. The only small advantage we will have is the knight over the DSB. We need to keep our assets off the dark squares and use the knight to (hopefully) create a conundrum from which black won't be able to escape. With less opposing assets on the board this will be less likely to happen for us. 

My original idea was to use the knight to create a fork which would give as a good advantage. It is easier to do this when the opponent has more assets on the board. Now we will have to rely on the knight to negate the opposition's assets at best. It is going to be an uphill battle. The only possibility that I can see right now is to take a pawn and hope that one point advantage will be enough to cinch the game for us. 

Forgive me if I think in military terms. I plan on strategic tactical and operational level.  archduke_piccolo: Time zones...
... I tend to find this a problem too living as I do at the ends of the earth! 

I have expressed my own views on exchanges in my previous posting but one: rooks yes; minor pieces probably yes; pawns yes; Queens no. But I agree that we have to be alive to the nuances of the position. 

This present exchange doesn't hurt us and we really had to take the pawn back at once anyhow. But after we play 21.Rxa1 the game enters a new phase. 

Riann is correct to imply that there is a battle going on for the initiative. Right now it is up for grabs though Black does have this advantage: it's his move! 

Our problem is that we are lacking targets to hit. The enemy is better off slightly in this regard. Our Q-side pawns are just a little bit easier for him to come at than his are for us. On the K-side we have a slight weakening of the dark squares - the same squares as the enemy bishop operates on. That the Black K-side is similarly placed is immaterial as we don't have the light-square bishop to exploit it. These little features don't amount to much in themselves but they do give Black something to work on that we don't (yet) have. 

My assessment of the situation is that Black has a very marginal edge but the ga"

We need to get our pawns out of the reach of the DSB. Put our pawns on white. 

Our knight is effectively pinned at the moment. Unfortunately there's a pesky rook covering the d-line. I would have loved to get our knight moving. Kd4 would have been a good start. 

At least we have the a-line open. Maybe there is an opportunity in there if we can keep the opposing queen otherwise occupied and get some assets towards the h8 corner.....  archduke_piccolo: Difficult...
Let me say that this ain't an easy position! Not for us at any rate. 

I'm going to throw in a move to consider that I would normally avoid: 

22.Qf3. 
I'll tell you right now: I don't like it I don't want to exchange queens I don't want to break up our K-side I would rather not be left with a minor piece end game (if the rooks come off as well). But I have an uneasy feeling that already we might be fighting for survival. I'll have a bit more of a think about it (it might simply be unplayable). 

Lest you think I'm being inconsistent - previously advocating avoiding Q exchanges yet now suggesting an unfavorable exchange such as this - we have to be alive to changes in relative values as the position changes with each move. Black's seizing the d-file was a very strong move - one I rather think I underestimated. Mind you I don't think we could have done anything about it. 

For the rest: 

1. 22.Re1 certainly demands consideration. 

2. I think we ought also at least to look at 22.Rd1 even though it drops a pawn: 22...Rxd1ch 23.Qxd1 Qxc4 24.Qd7... I doubt we'll get enough for the pawn but we should a least check it out. 

3. 22.Ra2 - to keep the BR out of our second rank? Sounds like a good idea. 

4. I'm definitely not keen on pushing the K-side pawns as has been suggested and here's why. Now I understand the reasoning: get the pawns into light squares that the enemy bishop can't reach. But in my view now is not the time. Once the game has been reduced to one piece or maybe two without the Queens then we probably should revisit this idea. 

Right now the result would be a serious weakening of the dark squares around the White King which Black will be well placed to exploit. If 22.f3 would be bad enough to follow with 23.g4 would I think put the game well beyond our reach. 

5. I want to look at 22.Na7. It probably isn't much chop the knight b"

22...Rd7 and I'm looking at 23.Nc3 in reply with a view to relocating: Nd5.

I think it is time to move our knight out of that position and use it positively. At the moment it is a liability by locking up a pawn that can be used to disrupt b- and c-pawns. We need to turn this over to a positive game not a passive/defending game.

897,31,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But black plays something very unusual.  More common was 1...e5 or 1...c5  This move doesn't help develop or anything similar except pushing pawns.  Now TA mentions that in his club and it's one reason that he's going to sac on a different square then usual.
898,31,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/5pp1/7Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Forced.
899,31,3,Qxh7,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp2Q/5pp1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',So this is where it begins.  Now as Joe noted this time black doesn't have to take.  But it is nonetheless the best move here.  It's also worth noting that unlike my last annotation TA doesn't have any real plans.  He sees weaknesses by black is bound to take advantage.  That's where later on theory will mix in.

904,31,8,d4,b'rnbqkbn1/pp1p3r/2p2pp1/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQq d3',With that being said white isn't waisting time or taking chances.
905,31,9,d6,b'rnbqkbn1/pp5r/2pp1pp1/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQq -',He also could play 6...d5 and white would decide which pawn to take.  
906,31,10,Bc4,b'rnbqkbn1/pp5r/2p2pp1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQq -',As noted despite being behind material wise white already has a solid lead in development.  In fact it's almost complete and only needs to deploy one piece whereas black did not bring a single minor piece into play yet.

908,31,12,O-O,b'rnbqkb2/pp5r/2p2ppn/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b q -',So white takes advantage of that by castling immediately.

913,31,17,g5,b'rn2kb2/pp2q2r/2p2p1n/4p1p1/4P3/1PN2N1P/1PP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w q -',With the plan to fork N and P so that if ...PXP white's K becomes wide open which is known to put you at a disadvantage.  With the N here however the K is no longer open as we have an extra defender around it.

918,31,22,1h4,b'rn2kb2/pp5r/2p1qp1n/4p3/4P1pP/1PN1B3/1PP2PPN/R4RK1 b q -',Yes I have seen this response in IM and GM games as well.  That instead of exchanging white advances further.  Now what I wonder is why do they do this.  To me it would've been overgeneralizing as it was with dynamic_dv.  So I would've exchanged with 15.hxg4  Despite not liking those doubled pawns that's what I'm most comfortable.  And I like to go by what I'm most accustomed to or comfortable with.
919,31,23,1f5,b'rn2kb2/pp5r/2p1q2n/4pp2/4P1pP/1PN1B3/1PP2PPN/R4RK1 w q -',? The plan is to either advance his pawn which would gain tempo by attacking the DSB or he thinks that white will exchange starting with 16.exf5  However this move gives back a pawn to black.  So better was 15...a6 15...b6 or 15...c6 as all of these protect the a pawn.
920,31,24,Nd7,b'r3kb2/Bp1n3r/2p1q2n/4pp2/4P1pP/1PN5/1PP2PPN/R4RK1 w q -',Not only developing but protecting his N as well.

922,31,26,1Be3,b'r3kb2/1p1n3r/2p1q2n/4p3/4p1pP/1PN1B3/1PP2PPN/R2R2K1 b q -',I would've played 18.Nxe4 to get the pawn back.  But the fact that white doesn't means that TA has strategy.  At first I wasn't sure what it was but it makes sense.  The plan is either get a R or create a threat.  For example if 8...Rxa1 if 9.Rxa1 now black can't castle because he'd have to bring the N to b8 if black were to avoid a K exposure.  Yes even being a Q up you can't let your K become exposed especially against a stronger player.
923,31,27,1Nf5,b'r3kb2/1p1n3r/2p1q3/4pn2/4p1pP/1PN1B3/1PP2PPN/R2R2K1 w q -',? This move gives white back a R as compensation.  Plus as noted black's monarch becomes exposed here.  Best was 18...Rxa1.
924,31,28,Kf7,b'R4b2/1p1n1k1r/2p1q3/4pn2/4p1pP/1PN1B3/1PP2PPN/3R2K1 w - -',?? According to TA this was a super blunder and I agree with him.  The idea being now that white will get a family fork and thus win something much more valuable.  So although black has the Q when all is said done white will become ahead.  And with best play as it will be white should win the game.  With that being said best was 19...Bh6
925,31,29,2Nxh7+,b'R4b2/1p1n3N/2p1qk2/4p3/6pP/1P2n3/1PP2PPN/3R2K1 b - -',I'm surprised that TA did not play 22.Nxe6 as that's what I would've done.  I believe that white wanted to get something in such a way that black can't take back which is why he would capture here.
926,31,30,2Kg7,b'R4b2/1p1n2kN/2p1q3/4p3/6pP/1P2n3/1PP2PPN/3R2K1 w - -',And now is the time to exchange because as it turns out this is liquidation as white is going to wind up a piece ahead.
927,31,31,2fxe3,b'R4n2/1p4k1/2p1q3/4p3/6pP/1P2P3/1PP3PN/3R2K1 b - -',That is how.
928,31,32,2Ng6,b'R7/1p4k1/2p1q1n1/4p3/6pP/1P2P3/1PP3PN/3R2K1 w - -',Getting the last piece out but it's too little too late because of what white now has.  The game isn't lost yet but black is now at a serious disadvantage.  By that I mean worse then it appears.
929,31,33,2g3,b'R7/1p4k1/2p1q1n1/4p3/6pP/1P2P1P1/1PP4N/3R2K1 b - -',Adding to his advantages with this pawn chain.  And now that we're nearing the endgame the K will start to become a weapon soon.
930,31,34,2e4,b'R7/1p4k1/2p1q1n1/8/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP4N/3R2K1 w - -',Stopping white's center pawn from advancing further.
931,31,35,2Kg2,b'R7/1p4k1/2p1q1n1/8/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/3R4 b - -',But this is where TA uses his K as a weapon.  The long term plan of course is to centralize his K so that it's near his opponents K so that you have known and dangerous fortress around it.  That's known in endgames starting with a process called triangulation.  That is where you move it in a triangle.
932,31,36,2Qf5,b'R7/1p4k1/2p3n1/5q2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/3R4 w - -',There is a chance that white's N would move.  And if that happens black would have a dangerous threat with ...Ne5 followed by ...Qf3+ which appears to be his goal.
933,31,37,2Rdd8,b'R2R4/1p4k1/2p3n1/5q2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 b - -',But white has other ideas first.
934,31,38,2Ne5,b'R2R4/1p4k1/2p5/4nq2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 w - -',Yes this is part of black's plan as noted on his last move.
935,31,39,2Rdg8+,b'R5R1/1p4k1/2p5/4nq2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 b - -',But this was white's plan though.  And now black is in more trouble then earlier.
936,31,40,Kg7,b'R6R/1p4k1/2p5/4nq2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 w - -',Black is attempting to trick white into a draw by repetition since his K was on this square before 28.Rg8+
937,31,41,3Rag8+,b'6RR/1p4k1/2p5/4nq2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 b - -',! But white doesn't allow it.  Note: It'd be very easy to play the wrong move with 30.Rhg8+ and after 30...Kh7 it's a draw by repetition.  But this move prevents that as the monarch can't go there.  Now I don't usually mention that but it really isn't that obvious because while it was much earlier in the game easy19 made a similar mistake in our first game each so I was able to get a draw by rep out of him.  And now I compare that game and mistake I made with the B+N mate the first three time.  So it boils down to the same thing.  Why allow a draw when you have a winning advantage? 
938,31,42,3Rh6+,b'6R1/1p6/2p2k1R/4nq2/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 b - -',Adding to his advantages TA plays this to put pressure against black's Q which will soon prove useful.
939,31,43,3Rg5,b'8/1p2k3/2p4R/4nqR1/4p1pP/1P2P1P1/1PP3KN/8 b - -',And this is where that happens.
940,31,44,3Qf3+,b'8/1p2k3/2p4R/4n1R1/4p1pP/1P2PqP1/1PP3KN/8 w - -',"?? I understand this move very well as black thought that he a mating sequence.  He was thinking along the lines of 33.Kg1 Qxg3+ 34.Kh1 Nf3 followed by 35...Qxh2#  Or if white played 34.Kf1 then comes 34...Nf3 followed by 35...Qf2#  However black overlooked the N.  Therefore white is going to get the Q for a N in addition to what joseph82501 has lost.  So with it TA implied the same thing that Jack Stockel would say in his club.  ""This loses immediately.""  That's because in addition to being ahead black is going to get back his Q.  And TA directly stated that once black gave him back the Q it was all over from then on.  Better was to retreat to the seventh or eighth rank. "
941,31,45,3Kf2,b'8/1p2k3/2p4R/4n1R1/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',"This is the triangulation I was alluding to earlier since the K was originally on g1 went to g2 earlier and has now traveled to f2.  As I learned from Susan Polgar in endgames this is very damaging.  That is the ""systematic method"" that I once learned about since it involves trigonometry.  The idea is that the K has now gone in a triangle which is known to be problematic for the opponent.  "
942,31,46,3Nd7,b'8/1p1nk3/2p4R/6R1/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 w - -',Getting the N to safety but it's no use any longer.  It does keep black in a little longer but it is nontheless a clear win for white.
943,31,47,3Rg7+,b'8/1p1nk1R1/2p4R/8/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',Starting with this move.
944,31,48,3Rd6,b'3k4/1p1n2R1/2pR4/8/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',!! Black will lose his remaining piece no matter what he does since it's now pinned.  In addition white will pick up another pawn.
945,31,49,3Rg6,b'8/1R6/2p3R1/2k5/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',Indirectly putting pressure on the c6 pawn with the plan being 40.Rc7
946,31,50,3Kd5,b'8/1R6/2p3R1/3k4/6pP/1P2PpP1/1PP2K2/8 w - -',Black stops it but not for long.
947,31,51,Kd4,b'8/1R6/2p3R1/8/3kP1pP/1P3pP1/1PP2K2/8 w - -',Nothing is going to help black no matter what he does.  Not even 41...Kxe4+  Even after that black might as well resign.  For example after 41...Kxe4 42.Rb4+ Kf5 43.Rbxg4 Ke5 44.Kxf3 Kd5 45.c4+ Ke5 46.R4g5+ Kd4 47.Rxc6 and black has nothing else except for his K.
948,31,52,4Rg5,b'8/1R6/2p5/6R1/3kP1pP/1P3pP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',Putting the pressure right on black and preparing to mate him right away.  The plan being 42.Rb4#
949,31,53,4c5,b'8/1R6/8/2p3R1/3kP1pP/1P3pP1/1PP2K2/8 w - -',! Stopping the mate for now but not for long.
950,31,54,4Re7,b'8/4R3/8/2p3R1/3kP1pP/1P3pP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',So TA comes up with another way.  But this time there is no way to prevent or delay mate.
951,31,55,4Rd5#,b'8/4R3/8/3R4/2pkP1pP/1P3pP1/1PP2K2/8 b - -',The first lesson that we learn is not becoming overly confident even when you have the winning position.  But the second lesson that he taught is that being a Q up with an advantage does not mean that you abandon general opening guidelines.  For example like with my last game against Mary black pushed pawns and even brought the Q out early when he used that time to develop his pieces and castle.  Also and it's something that I've forgotten but when making moves be very careful and really study the position.  For example black earlier made a move as it appeared good to get out of check but what he didn't realize is that white would go from behind to ahead.  That gave him an advantage.  And black made another blunder because he thought that there was a mating sequence but overlooked the N.  In doing so white won back the Q in addition to all else and was therefore able to force this win.

953,32,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Yes I also would've played this as I like the Sicilian.

In fact during that game that I won after what should've been lost from an improper opening that I now tell my students.  The win was from the fact that my opponent missed a mating sequence on 6 occassions I was just using memory techniques since it was a struggle.  And I thought about what this senior master did in that kind of situation where his opponent was beating him and more or less followed the same technique.  Proof that you can learn lot from reading his posts and studying games by stronger players.

Usually when the Q retreats the opponent can continue developing get better control of the center and castle sooner.  But it won't stop Joe from following through on his plans.  Instead he is going to give up his Q and with it there is an important lesson. 
956,32,4,Qxf7+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppQpp/5n2/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',So it starts with this move.

Unless I'm missing something since I'm known to do so best was 6...Ke8 to prevent what's about to happen next as now black will at the very least lose a pawn.  Usually it wouldn't matter but the point is that you still must be careful with any opponent especially someone of this strength.  At first I viewed this as a mistake for the lost of the e pawn but the reality is that it loses much more and will at the very least give white total compensation with in fact a small advantage.

At this point black felt that he had won something else and was increasing his advantages but there's where one goes wrong.  Instead black in addition to having lost a pawn also had to give up his Q.  Therefore there was one ways out.   It was 8...Kf7 in which white immediately takes the Q.  But with this move however white will mate immediately.  As they say ""To take is a mistake"".  That especially applies here and  it's worth noting that while it appears so 8...Qe7 doesn't help either.  9.Ng5+ Qf7 (forced) 10.Bxf7#"

Yes C++ was right that there was a little more to it but here; it especially applies here since TA implied it at his club which I absolutely agree with.   That's due to one of Jack Stockel's annotation where a player lost to him for the same reason.  ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning a position be very careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and losing the game.""  To support it's important to note that many players after having had won the Q early think that it's won.  So it doesn't matter what else they play even weak moves.  But that is what seals their fate.  The idea being is that just because you have the advantage doesn't mean that you should become overly confident.  Instead it's important to play the same way as you would with any game.  That's because becoming careless could cost you the game as it did here."

986,34,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"That's because this is now the Colle's System named after GM Colle-Zukertort who is believed to be the first world champion dating back to 1886.  And as noted my favorite GM recommended that I give this is a try so I was going to follow her advice for the OTB chess games where it's not rated yet you learn.  And before that I have never played this version.  One time only I played 1.d4 followed by 2.Nf3 when 1...d5 wasn't played but I have not played e3 so early until yesterday.  Having said that I was planning on this since that e-mail so we're talking about 3 weeks (since July 20th.)  It's also worth noting that I don't memorize as per advise but when Susan explains or has explained this (for that matter as I've completed the lectures by her) they become second nature very quickly which doesn't happen with most players not even Jack.  So in that she said ""Today I'd like to introduce an interesting system for the white pieces that could save you a lot of time.  The reason it would save you a lot of time is because it's a setup that you play against most of black's possible responses and it's also a setup that guarantees you a healthy solid position for in all of your games.  I am talking about the Colle Opening and to be more specific the Colle-Zukertort system.  Johannes Zukertort was one of the early practitioners of this system.  Zukertort played in what many consider the first World Chess Championship match versus Steinitz back in 1886.  It is safe to say that this system has stood the test of time!  You open the game for white with 1.d4 moving the Queen's pawn and you follow up with active minor piece development Nf3 getting the knight out and then e3 which opens the bishop which moves to a solid central square Bd3.  I think you should give it a try with the Colle-Zukertot opening system as it has been employed successfully at all levels (including the Grandmaster level!)"""

However more common was 4.b3 and then 5.Bb2  The thing is as noted I don't memorize things but in the course she said that those two moves if added completes the variations of the Colle-Zukertot system.
989,34,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Not suprised to see this.

After 5.Bb3 though no worries yet I felt he'd eventually hit my B on the third rank and would thus lose a piece for a pawn as it would become possible to lock it in.  Thinking about the sequence I wasn't going to take that chance.
991,34,7,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Standard and the B is right in the center which is a very good place.

993,34,9,Qc7,b'rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Normally I don't know why you'd bring the Q out before completing development since nothings en-prise and it's not the like Domino Defense.  But after what dynamic_dv did which was very similar and with comments I realize that this is a similar position which makes it a good move.  The idea isn't comparing games but rather comparing positions as per what I learned from kenneth_fiore.
994,34,10,c4,b'rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq c3',But this time I don't deviate from guidelines as the idea is that with Q pawn openings you shouldn't develop the N on b1 until the c pawn has moved.  With that being said the plan is of course Nc3 when it's safe to do so.  Having said that after we exchange as it's safe to do that's when I'll play that.
995,34,11,b5,b'rnb1k2r/p1q2ppp/2pbpn2/1p6/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',With that being said I was planning to play 9.Nc3 but thinking about the forcing moves which in this case means the obvious reason that is not possible as of the moment.
996,34,12,Ng4,b'rnb1k2r/p1q2ppp/2pbp3/1p6/3P2n1/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This time I thought I could as I wasn't worried about the N.  But then I did homework asking myself why that N moved since first why is the most important and common question ask.  Second for that reason it's theory which is very important.  This is where I realize that Bert is threatening through a combo.  And it's a very similar position to a quiz that Susan gave me with the same lecture which for a change not only did I get correct but for the right reason.  Therefore he threatens 10...Bxh2 and if 11.Nxh2?? he mates with 11...Qxh2#  So the only other option would be 11.Kh1 which not only loses a pawn but the K is exposed.  As a result he'd have a noticeable and I believe a winning advantage from that point which I cannot allow.

Sure I don't lose a pawn but wind up in trouble after 10...Bh2+ for what I noted which isn't so obvious  and thus worth explaining.  With that being said this is the only way out.

This time however I forgot about my e3 pawn which protects d4 and if this weren't OTB chess I wouldn't have forgotten things like this since I use analyze the board.
1003,34,19,1Bxb5,b'r3k2r/pbqn1ppp/3bp3/1Bp5/3PN1n1/4PNP1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',?? Worried about my pawn however I thought I had two options on how to take.  The other way of course was 13.dxc5  The reason I captured here was to at the same time keep his N pinned.  However this is was a blunder caused by an oversight.  I overlooked the discovered attack so the N had to be defended instead.  By playing this forget about a pawn because I lose a piece for the pawn which wasn't worth it.  Best was the immeidate 13.Nxd6 and it's still even.

I knew I wouldn't win anything but kept in mind that as GM Demion says you should create threats.  With that I followed his advice and played this since now that I've blundered a piece I will do some hope chess in an attempt to compensate which will eventually happen coincidentally as it's for an unusual reason though.  Bearing in mind that if he's not careful I'll take either N or B.  Of course I don't play simply to win something back as I know that he won't allow it.  But the plan is that when protecting I will gain some needed tempo of my own.
1005,34,21,1b3,b'r3k2r/p1qn1ppp/3bpn2/1Bp3N1/3Pb3/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',In reality this was the immeidate plan behind 14.Ng5  The reason I fianchettoed again is that I knew I had time for it which is the beauty behind the gain of important tempo.  If 15.Bd2 I'm left with a bad B which I don't want as I know how it'll end.  Coindentally with the finachetto followed by the next move which I wasn't aiming now we're in the equivalent to the full Colle-Zukertot system.  It wasn't the main but it's how it all ended up anyhow.
1006,34,22,1Bg6,b'r3k2r/p1qn1ppp/3bpnb1/1Bp3N1/3P4/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I don't why black played that but this is the point where he begins to get tired and is the conerstone to falling to asleep.  In addition the reason I view it as pointless is that I feel that this is Hope Chess.  I felt that he was hoping that I'd make a mistake and play 16.e4? losing a pawn.  However I saw that because while I considered it I decided not to as black would be achieving his goal.
1007,34,23,1Bb2,b'r3k2r/p1qn1ppp/3bpnb1/1Bp3N1/3P4/1P2P1P1/PB3P1P/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Therefore I don't care and view it as a waist of time.  That's because I thought that best was to castle at once which I understand as white doesn't gain advantage should he do so.  At least not to my knowledge.  Since I view his last move as pointless I don't waist any time into completing development once and for all.  As now my optimisim of comensating for lost material has grown seeing that he is starting to fall asleep.  The idea is that when tired you often make mistakes as I learned from watching a GM game based on comments by I'm not sure who but one of the most successful and famous Grandmasters.  In fact I watched a video on a tourney that Judit Polgar commented and I believe that this is where it was mentioned.

Now I originally thought that the only other move which appeared better before playing it was 17.Nh3  The reason I didn't is that it also loses with his tactic after 17...Bf5

First the position got corrupt when I did that.  Second this is how it looked after he castled this way.  So I realize that this is what he did (how it was played.)

But I already knew the weakness seeing how tired he was.  With that I felt that I had a possible advantage here.  Normally I'd have no grounds for saying but being tired affects your play as noted earlier.
1013,34,29,1c6,b'r4rk1/p1qnbpp1/2P1pnbp/1B6/8/1P2PNP1/PB3P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I take advantage of his mistake.
1014,34,30,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/p2nbpp1/2Pqpnbp/1B6/8/1P2PNP1/PB3P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? Right after this move he's asleep.  With that being said he had to retreat this time around.  I looked and asked myself if there were options and there isn't.  So by playing this the plan of total compensation for what I lost becomes a reality and then some.  As now I wind up ahead when all is said and done.  And this is how I remembered that he didn't castle long and why it wouldn't be as good.  Had he played 17...0-0-0 it wouldn't be 20.cxd7 but winds up in check so after 20.cxd7+ he would've lost a R at the very least.  In addition I had a hard time deciding between exchanging Q's with 20.Qxd6 or taking with 20.cxd7  The reason I captured on c7 was to win something at once and I kept in mind that if and when he takes the Q I can and would take back because what I was evaluating is if taking on d7 lost my Queen.  Once I determined it was safe then was the time to take advantage of that opportunity.

I had a tough time deciding between this and 23.Nxg6  The reason I didn't exchange was that I calculated a possible line that would Q and possibly win a R.  However the calculation was inaccurate.  Best was indeed 23.Nxg6  This move will mean trouble in the long run.  After everything was put away Bert and I both had to use the restroom.  He told me where I went wrong.  In it he said that I should've exchanged earlier because by not doing so his B combined with the other became so dangerous and impossible to stop that he was able to use his B's to defeat me later on.  Now I got a picture in my head with the accurate position and figured out what he was implying.  That this is where I should've exchanged.  While it's fine for now in the long run and towards the end this will cost me the game.  And that's the only reason I'm giving this move two quieries.  For if we didn't have that discussion I wouldn't mark with anything.

Without his f R I thought along the lines of 27.d8=Q+ Bxd8 28.Nxd8  That's because I did something which I shouldn't have and just remembered what I did in my game against angellis where promoting won a R.  However I forgot something that Karpov emphasized that you don't just play something in one game because it was good in a previous game.  You base on the position.  So getting hyperfouces I very breifly analyzed the position but didn't do enough HW as I overlooked his other R.  Therefore promoting is going to give him back a pawn.  And it's the move that I calculated and planned when playing 26.Ba3?!  But that was inaccuracy for that reason as well.  I'm not sure what the best move was here but I think it was 27.Bxd5 and after 27...Bxd5 I'd play 28.Rad1 to double up.

In an annotation who I gave advise to I gave a suggestion which was bad because it blocks his B.  Then I made a mistake in a game shortly after that did the same thing.  So with that being said the plan here is to lock his B so that I'd win it.  I wind up locking it in but there's one oversight that prevents him from doing so.  He is still in and out of it but more alert then he was before.  Once again I forgot that you shouldn't compare with other games which I tend to do with stronger players.  Instead it's about the position which I also analyze but not enough.  In other words in OTB chess games I move a little too quickly which is a bit problematic.  In part it's because we only have 2 hours and a game will often take more then half of that time.
1029,34,45,3Bc2,b'3r2k1/p2r2p1/4p2p/3n1p2/3R4/BP2PPP1/P1b1B2P/R5K1 w - -',In anticipated this but that's where I thought I'd win something as his B appears trapped.  Worth noting that since he's still a little tired I was confident that he made a mistake and thus was going to lose something like what happened earlier.  Unlike in other games this time I get overly confident because towards the end he wakes up is alert and I wind up in trouble.
1030,34,46,3Rc1,b'3r2k1/p2r2p1/4p2p/3n1p2/3R4/BP2PPP1/P1b1B2P/2R3K1 b - -',"? I had a little difficulty deciding between this and 31.Rc4 However both moves are mistakes for the same reason and he is slowly but surely getting back in the game.  With that this loses a pawn and now things are even.  When Jack saw Bert play 31...Nxe3 he said ""very interesting"". "

1033,34,49,3Bb5,b'3r2k1/p2r2p1/4p2p/1B3p2/R7/BP2nPP1/P6P/2Rb2K1 b - -',? No problem though.  Why run back when there's still a chance that Bert will fall asleep.  He does have more energy then he had before but is still somewhat tired.  So there is a chance that he'll asleep again and I keep that right in mind.  However I have now crossed the line as we're about to see.  Best was 33.Bf1 because of what's about to unfold. 
1034,34,50,3Rd7d2,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/R7/BP2nPP1/P2r3P/2Rb2K1 w - -',My last move is where I officially took things went too far.  Despite being a little tired his concentration is back with a vengeance.  And I am now trouble with the last move.  So the tables have turned.  One way or another he is going to win something.  33.Bb1 wouldn't have however because if 33...Nxf1 I'd take back and it's still even.  But now it winds up as anything but even as I'm now behind.
1035,34,51,3Bb4,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/1P2nPP1/P2r3P/2Rb2K1 b - -',?? However I didn't realize it here.  What I thought was that my f pawn was in danger and did Homework on what I had to do to protect it.  I did consider 34.Be2 but realized that I would lose my B.  Therefore there appeared to be no way of protecting except with this move.  But what I missed was a discovered check which will lose something worth much more.  This time it's my R.
1036,34,52,3Kh1,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/1P2nPP1/P5rP/2Rb3K b - -',Forced.  Now I knew that I'd lose my pawn.  But as noted it gets much worse.  And at this point which just discovered his energy is back.   But this time not only won't he fall asleep which I misjudged when figuring there was a chance but he is no longer tired either.  Therefore I'm in trouble from this point forward.
1037,34,53,3Bxf3,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/1P2nbP1/P5rP/2R4K w - -',That's because no matter what I play I knew he'd win my a pawn but I missed the one move that he'll play.
1038,34,54,3a3,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/PP2nbP1/6rP/2R4K b - -',?? This is where I became confident that I protected my pawn and therefore wouldn't lose anything else.  However I had to get my c R out of harm's way.  That's because of his next move.  
1039,34,55,3Kf2,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/PP2nbP1/5K1P/2r5 b - -',I also could've played 38.Be1?? or 38.Bf1?? but accurately realized that both would lose a piece beforehand.  So this was best.  In addition I figured that I'd win a piece back no matter what.  But it won't however be enough to compensate for what's happened.  On the other hand I last much longer and it's still a very complicated position.
1040,34,56,3Nc2,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/PP3bP1/2n2K1P/2r5 w - -',I guess a N is worth more then a B.  In addition this is the only move that I wasn't sure how it was played.  That's because I recorded 38...Ne4 which obviously isn't possible.  So I thought that maybe it was 38...Ng4  But then I decided to stop fussing about what black played because it's not enough to change.  All that matter is that regardless of where the N moved everything else including the results are the same.  So nothing has changed.
1041,34,57,Rb1,b'3r2k1/p5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/RB6/PP3KP1/2n4P/1r6 w - -',Going after my pawn.  So I'll take knowing that when he takes back I haven't lost anything else.
1042,34,58,4Kf4,b'3r2k1/R5p1/4p2p/1B3p2/1B3K2/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 b - -',?? Getting out of the check in the most aggressive way since the idea is now centralizing my K.  I figured that he couldn't do any more damage because I applied what I learned and remembered from a previous mistake that I made by not centralizing my K when at a disadvantage.  In this case I mean launching towards the center.  However it's a blunder as I will lose another piece.  Best was 41.Kf2  One reason for this blunder which is worth is that we're now on low on time.  It was 11:50 when I made this move and had to leave in 10 minutes.  So this is where things change and I no longer care about the position but rather comparing what I did or a mistake I previously made.  Otherwise I felt that I'd make worse mistakes and get mated very quickly.  Sure enough the fear of running out of time becomes a reality because it takes a few minutes to make two moves.  Therefore this is where I start speeding and go even quicker then what you'd see for even a fast a blitz game.
1043,34,59,4g5+,b'3r2k1/R7/4p2p/1B3pp1/1B3K2/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 w - g6',Yes I had anticipated this move.
1044,34,60,4Ke5,b'3r2k1/R7/4p2p/1B2Kpp1/1B6/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 b - -',So my plan of centralizing the monarch continues.  What I didn't realize though is that this was forced and now I lose another piece.
1045,34,61,4Kxe6,b'6k1/R7/4K2p/1B1r1pp1/1B6/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 b - -',Knowing that I figured that I might as well take the pawn.  In addition there's only 4 minutes left at most.  So we're now in a major time crunch.  I no longer care if I make moves that lose quicker because if I don't and I can't finish then I'd have no choice but to record the game as still in progress.  And the reality of it is that since it'll be posted in the WTWLTR club I have to record it as something whether win loss or draw so that it's more meaningful.  Otherwise what's the point if we say that nothing happened at all.
1046,34,62,4Rxb5,b'6k1/R7/4K2p/1r3pp1/1B6/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 w - -',"And it takes about 2 minutes to move here.  But Jack said that I still might have a chance and was happy when I stated that I wasn't going to resign.  That's for the same reason that I mentioned in the last game or when mentoring people that ""it's not over til it's over.""  In addition Jack Bert and I all agreed that this is and was very complicated and complex game.  And the position is still quite difficult so ""it's not so easy"" as Mr. Stockel has previously said."
1047,34,63,4Rf7,b'6k1/5R2/4K2p/1r3pp1/1B6/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 b - -',?? Time has just run out.  Actually I made this move during the last 30 seconds.  And the reason why I recorded as a lost as opposed to still in progress is that while we couldn't finish the game the position is lost.  Like a good coach Jack showed me why it was lost.  And he asked me to stay for just one or two minutes so that I could study it before leaving.  I reluctantly agreed because it's important to study variations to become a better player.  Plus as I've noted in previous annotations if I didn't know his highest rating it'd be very difficult to tell that he is not a GM because of how he explains things.  The very end after we call it a wrap proves it since he will play through and show me variations to show what happens.
1048,34,64,4Kh8,b'7k/5R2/4K2p/1r3pp1/1B6/Pr4P1/2n4P/8 w - -',With that being said he moved here.  But this is where Jack accurately said that the game was lost from here on in.  In it he said that best was 44...Rb6+! was best  And after getting out of check e.g. 45.Ke7 45...Re3+ wins my remaining R but this time it's without compensation.  That's because after getting out he can take with my K.  After that there's no hope left for white.

My guess is that he's doing this to strengthen his position on the Q side which makes sense since there's added pressure to the c file.  Nontheless I will take and force an exchange.  Now we were still at the phase where I thought that you just should against stronger players.  However I know otherwise that you don't just do so because you can.  And I feel that taking is going to strengthen his position which is why he would play this.

Without the defender 7.0-0? would be a mistake because of the pawn is hanging.  So it had to be protected somehow.  I also considered 7.Bd3 but I didn't see a reason to deviate and be forced to move the same piece twice.  I only do that if it were the only way to protect.  But when I can defend by developing another piece then that is what I will do.

But yes this makes sense as sooner or later black is going to gain tempo.  It's not so much for thrills and giggles of attacking something but the question is what happens after that?  You get which you can now use to develop another piece and brings him one step closer to castling.  In addition as we know tempo is indeed very important as I learned in a quiz with Judit Polgar.

I planned ahead but mistimed this.  I thought that I'd either force him to lose time or double his pawns right around the K which would make it unsafe to castle K side.  That's why I played this.  But just the opposite happened and then some.  I knew that he'd check but what I forgot about what his Q directly behind his DSB.  Therefore what I missed was the mistake that I avoided in a previous game.  By playing this move he's now going to win a pawn and will weaken my K side.

What Dave's threatening to do is double my pawns by trying to force an exchange on c3.  Well one of the things I don't like is doubled pawns.  I ask myself if there's a way I can avoid it.  There is not that much I can do for if I move the N elsewhere he will my b pawn since it's half pinned.  Realizing that there isn't much option I must exchange pieces despite not wanting to liquidate when down. 
1099,38,14,1g3,b'r3k2r/p1q2ppp/2p1bb2/3p4/8/2NB2P1/PPP2P2/R2QRK2 b kq -',Normally I don't just open up like this unless mate is immeidately threatened.  But I started thinking about those forcing as per what I've studied by Susan Polgar.  The real question does black does have any threats.  I think that Dave did here so I was preventing.  Now I had considered 15.Bf5 given that his B is pinned.  But the threat would still be there and black would play what I'm worried about would be 15...Bh4 and if 16.Bxe4 instead of taking Dave would also have the option of 16...Qf4 in which case 17...Qxf2# becomes a real threat.  That's why I considered the move with the idea that after 16...Qf4 that's when I would've been able to fork his Q+B with 17.g3 so I feel that I jumped the gun.  Instead of playing 15...Bh4 I believe that black would've taken back.  That's why I didn't play it.  Sure I was thinking about how he'd respond and with that he takes back with 15...fxe6  Normally I like this as it would be unsafe for him to castle Q side but since I'm down a pawn I'm not going to allow him to liquidate pieces.  Therefore I was going to take action as if the threat was there right now since it is bound to happen anyway.

I hope I'm not taking this too far.  It's worth noting that I did consider in this case what would've been a cheapo which is why I didn't play it that starts with the obvious 16.Qh5  If it weren't easy to drive off I'd play it since GM Damios said that you should create threats for your opponents.  But by that he was alluding to difficult to drive off.  However this would be too easy after 16...g6 which would lose tempo right away.
1102,38,17,1g6,b'r4rk1/p1q2p1p/2p1bbp1/3p4/8/2NB2P1/PPP2PK1/R2QR3 w - -',Since I did not bring my Q to h5 and there are no immediate threats I'm surprised that black played this.

1107,38,22,1Be2,b'r4rk1/p1q2p1p/4bbp1/3p4/N1p5/6P1/PPP1BPK1/1R1QR3 b - -',Well first of all it's indirectly forced as anything else at the very least loses a piece for a pawn.  Second even if the move wasn't forced this is what I would've played.  Why?  In the variations that it mentions the player retreating but in a place where it's right in front of the R for added protection.  So seeing that I would've done the same since the idea is applying what you've learned for your games.
1108,38,23,1Qa5,b'r4rk1/p4p1p/4bbp1/q2p4/N1p5/6P1/PPP1BPK1/1R1QR3 w - -',Not surprised to see this either since those variations mentioned that after you retreat in the way I did you often see the opponent attacking another piece.

So narrowing the two I still would've played this because in a variation I studied from a GM game one way you defend is what I call a discovered defense taken from the same idea as discovered attack or discovered check.  So that when you are attacked instead of retreating or reattacking you move something so that the piece behind defends your piece.  I think this is an example of interference because in a sense I am interposing with another piece.  Although not direct it's indirect.  The only reason I mentioned it is that I am using tactics here and Susan said that an important tactical term to remember was interference and now I know the definition.

Note: The reason why I'm applying more of these variations with Dave then other players is nothing short of the fact that he is an IM so I felt that I had to do things that way.  However as we will see too much of a good thing can become bad.  I also took notes here giving myself a difficult homework assignment that required variations.  In it the game notes that I took reads Process of elimination.  No good is 22.bxc4 because at the very least I would lose a R for B when down a pawn.  22...Rxd4 23.Qc2 Bf5 24.Qc1 Bg5 25.f4 Bh6

In addition 22.Bxc4 doesn't work because of 22...dxc3 23.Qc1 and after 23...c2 white loses a R for B.  That's because if the stays where it is 24...cxb1=Q and if it moves to a1 we have 24...Bxa1.  

22.cxd4 also doesn't work as white would also lose a R for B.  22...Rxd4 23.Qc2 Bf5 24.Qb2 Rd6 25.Qa3  So best is 22.b4."

Although I don't like it there aren't choices.  However with the variations I studied which was difficult to decide you often attack with the pawn.  By overanalyzing those variations I now wind up in trouble.  I'd normally feel that 23.Bg4 was better but it isn't as black would've played the same thing.  So I'm not sure what the best was.
1115,38,30,2f3,b'3r1rk1/p4p1p/5bp1/3b1q2/NPpp2P1/2P2P2/P3B1K1/1R1QR3 b - -',? A terrible miscalculation and not because of analyzing/playing through variations this time around.  Instead I was fussed on the pawn chain since that's important as I learned from a video by an IM forgot however what his name was.  But the K had to move back.  By playing this I wind up losing a pawn and then some adding insult to injury.  In fact something I forgot is what Jack said.  That when getting out of check it's better to use the K as opposed to interposing with a pawn or piece.

Plus I studied something from the e-mail course that you know about that when the K moves like this you're safe.  Unfortunately that isn't so here as you'd have a pawn.  Yet and it's not a trick but I thought along the lines that if black miscalculated which happened in my first game with easy19 believe it or not I'd move my K back and forth until the position repeated so that I'd wind up with a draw by repetition.

They often wait until later but in a position like this there was a variation where PXP which is why I played it thinking that there was nothing wrong.  But getting greedy is what did it.  Nontheless the game is lost one way or another so I felt that I might as well as there's nothing else to lose when in reality there was.  I felt that he had something dangerous but before doing so I was complicating his position by taking.  The reason being is that 28...Be5 is no longer possible and I'm accustomed to a mating sequence starting with that.  So by playing this move I thought that I had prevented the threat that's bound to come.  However there is no way out.  Thinking that I did I played a move that you'd typically see a strong player play but it doesn't help here.
1120,38,35,2Bh4,b'3rr1k1/p4p1p/6p1/3b4/NPpP3b/5Pq1/P3B3/1R1QRK2 w - -',At this point Dave has a mate in one.  That's because the K is pinned and in order to prevent mate it'd have to escape.  So I resign as he will play 29...Qf2# with no way out.  The lessons to learn are not to become obsessed with pawn chains because when I did it was lost from that point.  But also it's about not getting hyperfocused just because you think GM's play that move based on variations you've analyzed.  The perfect example was when I played 23.g4 after seeing similar position where the GM attacks Q.  By doing this I started getting myself in trouble and soon after there was no way out.

1141,39,20,1Rf8,b'rn3r2/ppp2Qpk/3bp2p/4N3/3q1B2/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? I thought I was making the most of my poor forces and dreamed to get a powerful counterattack. This was the second tactic I missed. 
1142,39,21,1Qg6+,b'rn3r2/ppp3pk/3bp1Qp/4N3/3q1B2/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',!
1143,39,22,1Nf7+,b'rn3r1k/ppp2Np1/3bp1Qp/8/3q1B2/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',! Not only I won't recover the piece but I will have to lose the exchange in order to survive (Kg8 Nxh6+ and white wins as he wants). 
1144,39,23,1Bxd6,b'rn5k/ppp2rp1/3Bp1Qp/8/3q4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',! Leaving me without my best placed piece and there is nothing I can do to recover my minor piece dued since Rd7 doesn't save the R against Qe8+... QxR.
1145,39,24,1Rxf2,b'rn5k/ppp3p1/3Bp1Qp/8/3q4/2NP4/PPP2rPP/R4RK1 w - -',...but can I still grab a pawn and get an interesting pin.
1146,39,25,1Rxf2,b'rn5k/ppp3p1/3Bp1Qp/8/3q4/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 b - -',Now I should have recovered the piece but if I do cxB (possible since Rf2 is pinned) but white will take e6 and I will have at most a losing endgame. 
1147,39,26,1Nc6,b'r6k/ppp3p1/2nBp1Qp/8/3q4/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 w - -',Better to cover the 8th rank and get two pieces more into the action!
1148,39,27,1Bxc7,b'r6k/ppB3p1/2n1p1Qp/8/3q4/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 b - -',"Another ""lost tempo"" by white..."
1149,39,28,1e5,b'r6k/ppB3p1/2n3Qp/4p3/3q4/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 w - -',"Blocking the B's action and ""defending"" my hanging e6 pawn."
1150,39,29,1Qe4,b'r6k/ppB3p1/2n4p/4p3/3qQ3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 b - -',Trying to provoke the Q''s exchange after which I'm lost. 
1151,39,30,1Qc5,b'r6k/ppB3p1/2n4p/2q1p3/4Q3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/R5K1 w - -',Still defending e5 but fearing Na5. Could I released white from the pin?
1152,39,31,2Raf1,b'r6k/ppB3p1/2n4p/2q1p3/4Q3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/5RK1 b - -',I still have Rf1 herem making the most of my weak position.
1153,39,32,2b5,b'r6k/p1B3p1/2n4p/1pq1p3/4Q3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/5RK1 w - b6',?? I just thought to prevent Na5. White's threats are too much to cover them all. All I can do is making his win a little harder. If 28... Rf1 29. Na5 and I lose more material. 
1154,39,33,2Kh1,b'r6k/p1B3p1/2n4p/1pq1p3/4Q3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/5R1K b - -',Released the pin I am at a very short distance from Rf8+ and mate. 
1155,39,34,2Rg8,b'6rk/p1B3p1/2n4p/1pq1p3/4Q3/2NP4/PPP2RPP/5R1K w - -',Making things harder for white. I can't move the N or Bxe4. Maybe Re8 could have been better. 
1156,39,35,2Rf2f5,b'6rk/p1B3p1/2n4p/1pq1pR2/4Q3/2NP4/PPP3PP/5R1K b - -',I can admit my mistake and go Re8 but again it seems only a meaningless resistance after the material disadvantage. 
1157,39,36,2Nd4,b'6rk/p1B3p1/7p/1pq1pR2/3nQ3/2NP4/PPP3PP/5R1K w - -',? Using my last piece but what else?
1158,39,37,2Bxe5,b'6rk/p5p1/7p/1pq1BR2/3nQ3/2NP4/PPP3PP/5R1K b - -',! The B in e5 whorts more than the exchange. Nxc2 was useless so...
1159,39,38,Qb6,b'6rk/p5p1/1q5p/1p2BR2/4Q3/2NP4/PPP3PP/7K w - -',Prevening Bxg7+ and RxQ.
1160,39,39,Qb7,b'6rk/pq4p1/7p/1p1NBR2/4Q3/3P4/PPP3PP/7K w - -',Preventing Ne7. 
1161,39,40,2Rh5,b'6rk/pq4p1/7p/1p1NB2R/4Q3/3P4/PPP3PP/7K b - -',Threatening Rxh6.

1163,39,42,2Ne7,b'6rk/p3N1p1/q6p/1p2B2R/4Q3/3P4/PPP3PP/7K b - -',The feared one.
1164,39,43,2Rf8,b'5r1k/p3N1p1/q6p/1p2B2R/4Q3/3P4/PPP3PP/7K w - -',The last useless hop: Ng6? QxN QxQ Rf1#. But my opponent is not so naive.
1165,39,44,2h3,b'5r1k/p3N1p1/q6p/1p2B2R/4Q3/3P3P/PPP3P1/7K b - -',I wonder (but I'll let my opponent to find out) a better move for white. This is enough...
1166,39,45,2Rf7,b'7k/p3Nrp1/q6p/1p2B2R/4Q3/3P3P/PPP3P1/7K w - -',What else?
1167,39,46,Kg8,b'6k1/p4rp1/q5Np/1p2B2R/4Q3/3P3P/PPP3P1/7K w - -',Incredibly enough it doesn't came to the eye a mate combination for white. Is there one?
1168,39,47,3g4,b'6k1/p4rp1/q5Np/1p2B2R/4Q1P1/3P3P/PPP5/7K b - g3',This is a three-move attack: g5 gxh6 are two tempoes so...
1169,39,48,3Qxa2,b'6k1/p4rp1/6Np/1p2B2R/4Q1P1/3P3P/qPP5/7K w - -',Now I am the one threating mate. Unless white finds a mating seguence right now. An he does!
1170,39,49,3Rxh6+,b'Q7/p4rpk/6NR/1p2B3/6P1/3P3P/qPP5/7K b - -',I saw some lines after KxR and I found mate. The other option leads to it straight forward. 
1171,39,50,3Qxg7#,b'8/p5Q1/6kp/1p2B3/6P1/3P3P/qPP5/7K b - -',Not a game to be proud of. My head is not at chess when worrying how to get to pay the rent. Still I hope you had some good laughts reviewing it. A good deserved victory for my opponent. Good for him!
