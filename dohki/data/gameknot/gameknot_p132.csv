128,5,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Gotta love the sicilian.
129,5,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The grand prix attack a variation I do not face as much although interestingly I had read an annotations of jstevens1 on another game where she played this just before our game commenced!
130,5,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The mainline of course being 3. ed5 This move tempts black to play 3... de4 but after either 4. Ng5 or 4. Ne5 white has a very solid knight in the center that will take time to remove meanwhile cramping black's development severely. 
131,5,4,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"Wary of ""allowing"" that knight to take the time to find a good post I play this move instead. "
132,5,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now we've transposed into a position more commonly reach as a closed Korchnoi sicilian. The move order usually used to reach this position is 1. e4 c5 2.Nc3 e6 3. f4 d5 4.Nf3 White has a lead in development but the pawn structure is certainly weaker a point exploited by my next move. 
133,5,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Finally black develops a piece! All these moves are typical for this type of position. While black has allowed white a knight in the center it is certainly not as strong as the earlier variation would have allowed and can be easily threatened with Nf6. 
134,5,7,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5NP1/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Given white's already poor structure around the king this move surprised me and the GK engine agrees allocating me a +.37 advantage although with no variations. Unless black plans to move e6 any time soon (unlikely) then the LSB is certainly going to be developed to either b7 or a6 this move seems to just help black to decide which route to take. And after the bishops have been traded there is one less defender on White's kingside whereas black's queenside will not be hurting. That being said it is the second most common continuation in this position (6. Bb5 being the major alternative) and has the best score in the DB. However one we get to a crucial position I chose a strong lesser-played variation that really tests white's setup.
135,5,8,Nf2,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The main idea in all the lines around g3 to castle Kingside and keep many minor pieces surrounding the king to cover the gaps. 
136,5,9,Rb8,b'1rbqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQK2R w KQk -',! Probably not worth an exclamation but certainly the most logical move to me in this position remove the threat of the b2 bishop and support an eventual black bishop on b7 trade off the LS bishops and attack white's plan to use minor pieces to protect the king and white's king!
137,5,10,1Re1,b'1rbqk2r/p3bppp/1pn1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQR1K1 b k -',The DB game has 10. b3 so we've reached a novelty. I'm not too threatened by this move my king is ready to castle and get off the e-file when necessary no need to slow the plan. 
138,5,11,1Bb7,b'1r1qk2r/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQR1K1 w k -',Natural.

140,5,13,1O-O,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/2p5/5P2/2P2NP1/PP1P1NBP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Whatever the case it's time for black to castle and complete his development. 
141,5,14,1d3,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/2p5/5P2/2PP1NP1/PP3NBP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',We've started to reach a middle game now and I certainly feel as though I've at least equalized as black. Despite starting with three pawn moves I've finished my development before white. The center is still up for grabs but I have the semi-open d-file and hope to trade off the LS Bishops soon. +.3 from the GK engine.
142,5,15,1Ne8,b'1r1qnrk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2p5/5P2/2PP1NP1/PP3NBP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',GK engine doesn't like this move dropping us back to an even keel but my idea was to help activate the DSB and get it on the a1-h8 diagonal. I also want a knight at d5 either entice c4 and strengthen that bishop's diagonal or let white decide to leave it there but I don't want to play 12... Nd5 yet because I'm still looking to trade off those bishops so I eye the Ne8-Nc7-Nd5 path. 
143,5,16,1Ne5,b'1r1qnrk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2p1N3/5P2/2PP2P1/PP3NBP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Again another move I'm not so sure of from white I'll gladly take and trade bishops. If white takes on b7 first my rook my be momentarily misplaced there but it's an easy fix after ...Rd7
144,5,17,Bf6,b'1r1qnrk1/p4ppp/1p2pb2/2p1R3/5P2/2PP2P1/PP3NKP/R1BQ4 w - -',Getting my bishop where it wants to be while gaining tempo on white. 
145,5,18,Nc7,b'1r1q1rk1/p1n2ppp/1p2pb2/2p5/5P2/2PP2P1/PP3NKP/R1BQR3 w - -',I could have played g7 and aimed to keep my bishop on the board but there are still a lot of pawns hanging around and the board is fairly closed this could turn into a great position to have a K v B
146,5,19,1Be3,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2pn4/5P2/2PPB1P1/PP4KP/R2QR3 b - -',White finally develops her last piece. 19. c4 and the bishop is tied to the defense of b2 for a while. 
147,5,20,1Rfd8,b'1r1r2k1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2pn4/5P2/2PPB1P1/PP4KP/R2QR3 w - -',I don't want to trade off in this position I love my knight and white's bishop doesn't seem to have much to say other than supporting d4 a push which would have lots of complications and I'm not sure my opponent wants to get into just yet. 
148,5,21,2Bf2,b'1r1r2k1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2pn4/5P2/2PP2P1/PP3BKP/R2QR3 b - -',Giving the e-file back to the rook.

151,5,24,2Rd7,b'1r4k1/p2r1ppp/1p2p1q1/2pn4/5P2/2PP1QP1/PP3BKP/R3R3 w - -',Obviously my way in is down the d-file and I decide to double up my rooks.

But then my rooks start to look idle on the d-file although 25. b3 cb3 26. ab3 Qc2 looks nice for black
158,5,31,Qc2,b'3r2k1/p2r1pp1/1p2p2p/3n4/3B1P2/2P2QP1/PPq4P/3RRK2 w - -',Invading into the position I had decided not to play nice any more and told jstevens1 that I would try to see if I couldn't stir up some tactics!

171,5,44,Kh7,b'4r3/p2q2pk/1pn4p/5p2/4pP2/PQP3P1/1P5P/2B1R1K1 w - -',I wasn't worried about the check but this is probably the weakest response I thought at the time that 36... Qe6 gave up my what little advantage I may have had but looking at 37. Qe6 Re6 black still looks okay if 38. Rd1 I would probably play ...Na5 immediately and try to improve that piece if 38. b4 then I would play 38... Rd6 and play the knight back to d8 and over to the kingside supporting those pawns first on e6 and later f4 or g5. The white bishop would have time to play Bb2 and finally truly enter the game but I think I'd rather play on as black at least while the rooks are still on the board. 
172,5,45,Qe7,b'4r3/p3q1pk/1pn4p/5p2/4pP2/PQP3P1/1P5P/2BR2K1 w - -',Playing to e6 wouldn't have been as good now as I would have allowed White time to play both Rd1 and b4. But perhaps it was better than the text. Alternatively if I had played the king to h8 after the check then a take on f5 doesn't come with check. 
173,5,46,Rd8,b'3r4/p3q1pk/1pn4p/3Q1p2/4pP2/P1P3P1/1P5P/2BR2K1 w - -',The first real large mistake of the game by either side I had missed that Qf5 came with check and thought that I had just been allowed to skewer white. GK recommends Qf6. 
174,5,47,e3,b'3r3k/p3q1p1/1pn4p/8/5PQ1/P1P1p1P1/1P5P/2BR2K1 w - -',And the mistakes keep coming GK recommends trading rooks and repositioning the knight but I may have tried to save my rook for a little longer this move essentially gives white another pawn. 
175,5,48,Nb7,b'7k/pn2q1p1/1p5p/8/5P2/P1P1p1P1/1P2Q2P/2B3K1 w - -',So I decide to try to tie up White's queenside The bishop still does not have a large scope perhaps I can get some counterplay the king is very open as well and this may provide me with some opportunities. 
176,5,49,Qd7,b'7k/pn1q2p1/1p5p/8/5P2/P1P1Q1P1/1P5P/2B3K1 w - -',Trading the queens off certainly wouldn't help
177,5,50,Nb3,b'7k/p5p1/1p5p/5q2/1P3P2/PnP3P1/3Q3P/2B3K1 w - -',A fork but I'm not going to remove the minor pieces hoping I may be able to get the queen to attack the bishop as well. 
178,5,51,4Qb2,b'7k/p5p1/1p5p/5q2/1P3P2/PnP3P1/1Q5P/2B3K1 b - -',protecting the crucial b1. 
179,5,52,4Qd5,b'7k/p5p1/1p5p/3q4/1P3P2/PnP3P1/1Q5P/2B3K1 w - -',Protecting the knight but the queen on b2 is somewhat limited and this move also gets Black's queen to the center. 
180,5,53,a5,b'7k/6p1/1p5p/p2q4/1P3P2/PnP3P1/2Q4P/2B3K1 w - a6',wanting to protect the knight with a pawn and free up my queen. 
181,5,54,4bxa5,b'7k/6p1/1p5p/P2q4/5P2/PnP3P1/2Q4P/2B3K1 b - -',GK engine doesn't like this much preferring Be3 almost forcing Black to undefend the a5 pawn or get a worse queen position. It wanted black to proceed by trading the minor pieces but this seems hopeless to me. At least if I keep the knight on the board I can hope for some complications down the road. 
182,5,55,5c4,b'7k/6p1/7p/p2q4/2P2P2/Pn4P1/2Q4P/2B3K1 b - -',GK labels this an inaccuracy over Be3 again
183,5,56,5Qc5+,b'7k/6p1/7p/p1q5/2P2P2/Pn4P1/2Q4P/2B3K1 w - -',The engine also much preferred Qd4 and keeps wanting me to take on c1. 
184,5,57,Qe3,b'7k/6p1/7p/8/p1P2P2/Pn2q1P1/1BQ4P/5K2 w - -',Hoping to maybe corner the king and win some material 
185,5,58,5Qc3,b'7k/6p1/7p/8/p1P2P2/PnQ1q1P1/1B5P/5K2 b - -',A mistake now from white throwing away the advantage and allowing me to force a perpetual! GK wants Bc3 to protect the undefended d2 square my knight needs. 
186,5,59,5Kg2,b'7k/6p1/7p/7q/p1P2P2/P1Q3P1/1B1n2KP/8 b - -',And a draw is agreed to. Overall I was very happy with my play until I let f4 drop but even afterwards I was able to keep pressure on and exploit the undeveloped bishop of White until I could take advantage of a misstep. A fun game to play :)

That contrast along with a few other time-wasting and questionable moves by white played a large part in the game.

I expect I will be taking a close look at moves 12 to 23.

as for where I went wrong 12. Bc3 wasted two moves.  16. Qxb7 is questionable but probably not bad on its own (otoh perhaps time could have been better spent on engineering an attack).  19. Re4 also probably not bad on its own.  25. Ke2 perhaps a waste of time.  26. Bxb4 hmm. prevents loss of c-pawn but loses bishop reducing attacking options.  28. Bxa4.  perhaps should have made queen safe and let N deal with black's a-pawn.  29. Re1 a wasted move.  Also from 22 to 25 (and even 19 to 22) white is somewhat well positioned to initiate an attack.  perhaps not proceeding was another mistake.  will have to see how these comments line up with what the computer has to say.

After that several exchanges made me believe the game was going to became a boring draw... but then I was wrong white kept one of the rooks and started pushing some pawns soon putting my position under severe pressure I was never able to remove my bishop from the front of the e pawn to push it foreword to e5 and white kept gaining space I needed a break on the other wing so I've opened a column for my rook and profited from some lack of mobility from white's rook for some moments I thought I was going to win easily attacking white's pawns from behind but then 31.e5! increased the tension on the king's wing and 34.Bd1! forcing another of my pawn to a light square made me step down to reality this was going to be a draw but an hard fought one!

519,18,0,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',King's Indian opening which is a bit more risk taker opening than for example Queen's Gambit Declined or the Queen's Indian when meeting 1.d4. The idea of King's Indian is to battle for the initiative right from the start and not just reacting to the opponents threats. You can come out on top if white gets lured by over-extending and also launching a counter-attack is blacks idea. It is not a big surprise that dynamic player like Kasparov used this opening during his career.
520,18,1,f3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"So white decided to go for Sämisch variation. This is true King of the hill variation as for example: Tal Spassky Karpov Kasparov Kramnik have all played the Sämisch and they all are World Champions. So the idea of 5.f3 is to defend e4 securing stable centre and due this white can attack on kingside lets say: Be3 Qd2 Bh6 g2-g4 h2-h4 can be used to carry out this plan. White can also attack on the queenside so Sämisch can be called as a flexible variation. Also Be3 can be played without worrying about ...Ng4. Well okay everyone can agree that knight on g1 seems to be on wrong square at the moment so Sämisch has drawbacks and kingside development is rather clumsy.

Lets say 6...Nc6 7.Bg5 and 6...e5 Bg5 have been slightly in White's favour. Books give 6...c5 as a reliable reply here and mention 6...a6!?(which I don't fully understand why) stated as flexible move. I would say the flexible one is to play 6...Nbd7 as white is going to show next is he going to play Bg5 or Be3. When 6...a6!? doesn't seem to have any very good reason to be played but after 6...Nbd7 you can't play knight to c6(then again white can't drive it away with d5).
523,18,4,Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',So white decides to go for 7.Be3. Bg5 ideas were not considered very much in the past until it was found out that Be3 doesn't really do anything to prevent c7-c5. By playing Bg5 white plays bishop on more active square and black plays h7-h6 in some variations to drive it away. We would need to go deeper in King's Indian and go through many variations to show the differences between these two so lets continue with the game. 7.Be3 protects d4 whereas in Bg5 lines white may lack that protection of d4.

It was in my head that 8...a6?! is possible and played here but then again why I would go for a move which I don't understand. What is exactly ...a6?! doing in this position as it seems to be waiting move only. If black is going to play ...b5 then it will be played anyway without preparing the move ...a6?!. So I was just thinking that I move Queen here as white surely doesn't want to castle queenside and meet the move ...b5 with a strong attack. If white tries to get hold on the kingside then Queen can jump there in some variations by doing knight maneuver to e6 aswell so that Queen won't be caught there.

Also 40...Ra1 falls to 41.Rh8+ Kf7 42.Rf8+ Ke7 43.Rgxf6 Qf1+ 44.Qg2 and white ends up better off.

E.g. 41...Kxg7 loses to 42.Rh7+ and 43.Qh5 whether or not black takes the knight.

Also after 41...Nf7 comes 42.Rh8+ Kxg7 43.Rh7+ Kg8 44.Qxc7 Kxh7 45. Qxf7 Kh6 white can force perpetual check with 46.Ne7.

And after 41...Nf5 42.Qxc7 maybe it's black who wants to take the perpetual check with Nxe3+ and N-g4+

Perhaps best is 41...Nd7 and after 42.Rh8+ Kf7 43.Qh7 Rg8! is the correct defensive move losing a rook after 44.Rxg8 Rxg8 45.Nh8+ Kf6 46.Qxg8 but by blocking the queening square allows enough time for 46...Qd1."

As you could probably see I inadvertently allowed my opponent to play a fork against me between my king and queen with his knight. I made a couple of mistakes but my biggest mistake was on my last move with Nc4. For someone who was fatigued however this was the best game that I ever played because I tried my best to play well. This game was a learning experience for me. I learned that one cannot play chess as well when he or she is tired. It is also better to get enough sleep before playing chess and/or it is not a good time to play chess if one is tired. Instead one should take a break and wait to get their energy back before returning to chess if it is feasible. In addition it might be good to set the time control for a longer period. In other words it is a good idea to consider changing the automatic decline challenge if one knows that he or she might get tired later in the day because it could take a while and possible one or two days to recover from tiredness.

1239,38,43,Rc4,b'6k1/R1P5/5K1p/7P/2r5/8/8/8 w - -',No choice left. After 60. ... Re8 61. Rb7 snuffs out all of blacks resistance...
1240,38,44,6Ke6,b'6k1/R1P5/4K2p/7P/2r5/8/8/8 b - -',White is invulnarable to checks now. 61. ... Rc6+ 62. Kd7 followed by 63. c8Q+ Rxc8 or 61. ... Re4+ 62. Kd5 and same... Black resigns...
1241,39,0,cxb4,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp1qpp1/1b3n1p/4p3/1p2P2B/P1PP1N1P/5PP1/RN1QR1K1 w - -',This is the biggest advantage Black gets in the whole game.
1242,39,1,Bc7,b'r1b1r1k1/ppbq1pp1/5n1p/4B3/3PP3/5N1P/5PP1/RN1QR1K1 w - -',Probably not the best. With the unbelievable 19...Rxe5! 20. dxe5 Qxd1 21. Rxd1 Nxe4 22. Ra2 Be6 gives Black the two bishops and good attacking prospects for the exchange.
1243,39,2,Qf5,b'r1b1r1k1/ppb2p2/7p/5q2/3PN3/3Q1N1P/5PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Here Black walks into the losing exchange.  23...Re6 would have been a better alternative.
1244,39,3,2Re4,b'r1b5/ppb2pk1/5q1p/8/3PR3/3Q1N1P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',....but White returns the favor and the exchange. He would have consolidated his advantage with 26. Ne5 Bd6 27. Rc1 b5.
1245,39,4,b6,b'2r5/p1bR1pk1/1p5p/3P4/8/5N1P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',33...Kf6 was better to get the king into the game.
1246,39,5,3d6,b'2r5/p1bR1pk1/1p1P3p/8/8/5N1P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',34. Nd4 gives White better prospects. 
1247,39,6,Kf6,b'1b3r2/p2R1p2/1pNP1k1p/8/8/7P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',Black should have made the most of his passed pawns. 36...a5 37. Nd4 Rc8 38. g3 Kf6 keeps White's advantage to a minimum but the text-move does not cause any major damage.
1248,39,7,Rd8,b'3r4/R4p2/1p1P1k1p/8/8/7P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',yet again 38....b5 is better but the text-move does not spoil Black's chances that much but Black must play with more care.
1249,39,8,f5,b'8/8/6kp/3r1p2/4R1PP/6K1/5P2/8 w - -',48...Rd6 is better as it gives support from the back. Now things get tougher for Black.
1250,39,9,5gxf5,b'8/6k1/4R2p/3r1P2/7P/6K1/5P2/8 b - -',50. g5 hxg5 51. hxg5 Rd4 52. f3 is better. The text-move gives Black more control and gives Black better drawing chances.
1251,39,10,h5,b'8/6k1/4R3/5r1p/5P1P/6K1/8/8 w - -',....and here is one of three mistakes that should have cost Black the game. Here 51...Rd5 halts White's attack enough so that Black can organise himself to get better chances.
1252,39,11,5Kf3,b'8/6k1/4R3/5r1p/5P1P/5K2/8/8 b - -',52. Re5 was a better alternative. 
1253,39,12,5Kf7,b'8/5k2/4R3/5r1p/5P1P/5K2/8/8 w - -',52...Rc5 was better here.
1254,39,13,Kf6,b'8/8/5k2/4Rr1p/5P1P/5K2/8/8 w - -',This is the main blunder. White is able to infiltrate Black successfully. Here 53...Kg6 supports both pieces and gives Black more chances. Black may have lost his last chance however......
1255,39,14,5Ke5,b'8/8/8/4K2p/5P1k/8/8/8 b - -',White throws away a golden oppourtunity: He wins with 57. Kf3!! where via computer analysis Black cannot avoid mate in twelve moves. The text-move gives Black a draw as both sides queen on the same move.
1256,39,15,5Kg4,b'8/8/8/4K2p/5Pk1/8/8/8 w - -',57....Kg5 does not work as we shall soon see.
1257,39,16,6Qg8+,b'6Q1/8/8/4K3/6k1/8/8/7q b - -',....now we see why 57...Kg5 would have been a blunder. Black would have been forced to play Kg6 5 or 4 and then Qh8 or h7+ wins the queen.
1258,39,17,6Kf3,b'6Q1/8/8/4K3/8/5k2/8/7q w - -',?? - Biggest blunder of the game this walks into Mate in eight! Who did not see the skewer at this point? 62...Kh3 is the only move and gives a draw. 
1259,39,18,6Qb3+,b'8/8/8/4K3/8/1Q3k2/8/7q b - -',"?? - however White for the second time throws away his winning chance. He wins via the skewer: 63. Qa8+ Ke3 64. Qxh1 Kd3 65. Qc6 Ke2 66. Qe4+ Kd1 67. Qg2 Kc1 68. Kd4 Kd1 69. Kd3 Kc1 70. Qc2#
