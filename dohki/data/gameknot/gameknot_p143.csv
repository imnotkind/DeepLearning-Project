1,0,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I guess I thought being aggressive would mean I dictate the game. Being white I wanted to use that tempo advantage to stop you running rings around me. It didn't work! From now on I'll save this aggressive style for lower rated players I think.
2,0,2,Nxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',After the exchange on d4 I feel I am in quite a good position here. Nice centre control and both bishops free to move whereas one of yours is blocked in.
3,0,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Preparing to castle early.
4,0,4,Bg5,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Looking back this move makes no sense to me. I suppose I was just thinking lets get all the minor pieces developed.
5,0,5,Qa5,b'r3kb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/q5B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Good  move from you pinning the knight down and threatening the bishop. I think maybe you were hoping for the upcoming exchange on f6 giving you the bishop pair. Since this game I've found out that in grandmaster play trading a bishop for a knight isn't seen as a good move. Here though I'm sure I thought that the bishop and knight were worth exactly the same.
6,0,6,gxf6,b'r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1p2/q7/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Well at least you have the doubled up pawns here. I never got the chance to take advantage though!
7,0,7,O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1p2/q7/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Finally I castle. My king is quite safe (for now).
8,0,8,Qc5,b'r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1p2/2q5/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Forcing me to do something about the double threat to my knight on d4 as well as my bishop on c4.
9,0,9,1Nxc6,b'r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2Np1p2/2q5/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The exchange is all I saw here. It benefits you though as with the knight on d4 gone your queen is looking quite menacing to my f2 pawn and the king it's defending.
10,0,10,1b3,b'r3kb1r/p2bpp1p/2pp1p2/2q5/2B1P3/1PN5/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Trying to keep the bishop where it is to maintain at least some centre ground. But maybe retreating the bishop to d3 or e2 would have been better.

12,0,12,1Na4,b'r3kb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/2q4p/N1B1P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This move is awful from me. Instead of moving the knight towards the kingside to help out against your upcoming onslaught i decide to put it on the rim of the board on the queenside! My thinking must have been just to get your queen away from the centre but this is really a poor move the knight is now useless for the rest of the game.
13,0,13,1a3,b'r3kb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/q6p/N1B1P3/PP6/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I'm preoccupied with trying to force a retreat from your queen. I guess I was thinking pawn to b4 after moving the knight on a4 out of the way but this is a lot of effort to go to just to get your queen back a couple of squares.
14,0,14,1h4,b'r3kb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/q7/N1B1P2p/PP6/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The queenside attack continues.....
15,0,15,1h3,b'r3kb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/q7/N1B1P2p/PP5P/2P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I try to prevent your pawn advancing any further down the board. But this move has weakened my king safety. In fact even a bishop sacrifice from you here (Bxh3) may not be the worst idea because it leaves my king wide open to attack.
16,0,16,1Qf3,b'3rkb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/q7/N1B1P2p/PP3Q1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b k -',Decided to bring my queen into the game
17,0,17,1Qh5,b'3rkb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/7q/N1B1P2p/PP3Q1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w k -',I think I should have accepted to exchange of queens here. Would mean you wouldn't be able to castle.
18,0,18,1gxf3,b'3rkb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/8/N1B1P2p/PP3P1P/2P2P2/3R1RK1 b k -',Yeah here's the other reason why I should have done the exchange first. Now the king is mightily exposed.
19,0,19,1Nc3,b'3rk2r/p2bpp2/2pp1p1b/8/2B1P2p/PPN2P1P/2P2P2/3R1RK1 b k -',I'm noticing the danger of the kingside now but too little too late that knight should never have been on a4 to start with.
20,0,20,1Bxh3,b'3rk2r/p3pp2/2pp1p1b/8/2B1P2p/PPN2P1b/2P2P2/3R1RK1 w k -',Only one thing I can do here to save material

Here I am still yet to achieve my first ever Expert Victory in a non-timed out game.  Now wouldn't it have been lurvely to have just done it against The Coach!  Off the board Ion has given me tremendous ongoing support but alas on the board Ion is painfully aware of my strengths and weaknesses and knows just how to tempt me into his tactical traps.  In this game it was not a case of simply walking into a one-move tactical shot and coming off worse I won a pawn in a speculative gambit that Ion played against me and tried to hold on to it at a cost of my development.  This allowed Ion to put a lot of pressure on me in particular the d column and he had a very strong knight which he used to devastating effect as first one black pawn then another dropped.  Gameknot analysis is provided here  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15730439&fb=1&rnd=0.7837962235268192 to help you follow this game of which incidentally is my longest game against Ion.

Ng5 as Alice in Wonderland would say curioser and curioser Ion moves the same piece twice in the opening to attack my advanced e pawn after I accepted the gambit.  I decided to play d5.  Although this does not develop a piece at least it opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc.

Nd5 - I try and improve the position of my pieces by easing the pressure on e6 (temporarily alas!) and posting my knight to a more active square.  Now if BxN or NxN then I will recapture with my e pawn and be a pawn up with a solid queenside majority of 4 against 2.  Ion wisely declines this exchange.

Although this counter-attack proved to be token I just felt the need to do something to show Ion that I am not simply a certain product of my former company Initial Textile Services Cambridge Division (that small Cambridge outlet used to provide mats to various companies in the Cambridgeshire Suffolk and Hertfordshire areas before it closed sometime in 2008) before deciding to wave the white flag.

I now finally waved the white flag.  Ion did say in his post-match pm ""I was expecting you to play on for quite a while actually. Yes I had a winning game but you were still in a position to throw a few caltrops in the way of my gallop to victory!   And I anticipated you would play 49...Rb4 but it never occurred to me to play 50.Kg1 in response. I was planning on 50.Kg3 Rxa4 51.Rxh6 then back to the g-file and shove the h-pawn. But 50.Kg1 does have its merits: the bishop has just one square available (c4) so I can see why you would exchange down into the rook and pawn ending. The problem there is that the lone rook hasn't a prayer against R and 3 and even if I had only two or even one pawn the fact that I could cut your king off on the Q-side would have given me the win. So after 50.Kg1 Bc4 would have to be tried."" I think 
that I could have played on but frankly I had had enough.  So yet again any thoughts of my first ever Expert Victory remain only in my dreams.  Well played Ion."

Qb8 - Glenda is threatening Qxb2+ but the Wicked Witch of the West can deal quite easily with that with a check of her own forcing Glenda to capture her and then the Witch will reappear on c8.  As I will be a whole queen down I decided to resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Here were Dave's comments to this move ""...... Qb8 cost you the game! For a long period I was thinking draw but when I played c5 and you played b5 that gave me a chance I would have a look at bxc I also think Rxd6 caused you problems but I could see why you did it so maybe look at alternatives to Rd8 because that move allowed me to put my rook on d6.""    Well played Dave!"

Black has to defend from mate in one (Qxb7#) and black loses the knight. And how can black defend? Nc5 attacking the queen doesn't work:  BxN+ Kb8 Be5+ winning the queen. Rd7 or b6 were not good either losing a piece. So Kh1 was a big blunder by white and the nice mate pattern is not such... chessi is wonderful :-)

Black is down a rook queen two knights and a two pawns whereas White has given up only the queen a bishop and two pawns.  Black has a vaguely better pawn structure but the isolated d-pawn is going to be difficult to maintain.  White can also castle on both sides whereas Black has just the one option.  Black's white-squared bishop has a limited scope and the same goes for the black-squared bishop.  This game is a disaster for Black and resignation is appropriate.

Having studied this opening in a 19th century game I know not to take the second pawn. If I do the white bishop takes b7 and then takes a8 one move later. For the gain of two pawns black loses a pawn and a rook.
546,25,4,Be6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I pull the bishop back to protect my own pawn. This move block's the king's pawn and hence makes it harder for my dark square bishop to get out and join the fight.

Possible responses are to bring back the bishop to d7 and threaten the queen move the knight to c6 to block the queen's attack block with my own queen or use a lowly pawn. Regardless of black's move I suspect white will move the queen to b4 and threaten the unprotected b7 pawn.

556,25,14,Nxc6,b'r3k2r/p1q2ppp/1pn1p3/1Qb5/8/8/PP1PPP1P/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',A predictable exchange of knights.

559,25,17,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/2q2ppp/ppn1p3/2b5/5P2/3QP3/PP1P3P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The rook takes control over the half-open file and puts more pressure on the white queen.
560,25,18,Nb4,b'r2r2k1/2q2ppp/pp2p3/2b5/1n2QP2/4P3/PP1P3P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The knight moves towards the tempting c2 square where it can fork the king and rook. Unfortunately there is a queen protecting that spot so I shall have to move the bishop out of the way of my own queen first.
561,25,19,1a3,b'r2r2k1/2q2ppp/pp2p3/2b5/1n2QP2/P3P3/1P1P3P/RNB1K2R b KQ -',But white obviously doesn't want my knight that close.

In retrospect I could have left the knight on d5 and sacrificed the bishop with an attack on e3. If white retakes e3 to prevent me from taking the rook on g1 then my queen has an open shot at the white bishop on c1. That would force the white king to move to f2 to protect the rook against another queen attack. I could then have move the rook from d8 to d1 to further threaten the white rook on g1.

579,25,37,2Ng3+,b'1rr2bk1/5p1p/1p2p1p1/p7/4QP2/P1N1P1n1/1P1PK3/R7 w - -',After Surprise #3 white decided to honorably resign. Upon reviewing the game I noticed white moved the queen in 11 out of 29 turns. White's tactics depended on using the queen often and thereby placing the queen in high risk positions. I usually responded to the queen moves by developing rooks minor pieces and pawns. 6 of the white queen moves were in response to threats against her so she was often moving defensively. By move 26 white still had two undeveloped pieces while black's pieces were projecting power over many squares.
580,26,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Can you find the refutation? In this game I rather speculatively sacrificed the exchange in return for threats to both white's king and queen - on both sides of the board. I couldn't see any defence. Neither could my opponent who surrendered material and lost quickly. Post-match analysis showed the sacrifice to be unsound. Perhaps against a stronger player I would have checked it out better and not played it. Can you find the defence we both missed at the time?
581,26,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',So my opponent opens with the Reti (Nf3) I grab space in the centre.
582,26,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',This was Reti's favourite although King's Indian Reversed set-ups with d3 and/or g3 are common too.
583,26,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Perhaps d4 is more aggresive but Black can end up with an over-extended centre if he is not careful.

598,26,18,1Nc3,b'rnbr2k1/ppp1bppp/q3pn2/8/2NP4/1QN3P1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Now on the database there are 3 games with 10. Nc3 and one with Rd1 - which looks the obvious way to defend d4 - Stoer Andreas (2150) vs. Lautner Josef (2126) which Black one. OK before reading on consider what happens if Black just takes the pawn on d4 now. Why can't he take it?
599,26,19,1Nc6,b'r1br2k1/ppp1bppp/q1n1pn2/8/2NP4/1QN3P1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So why can't Black just take the pawn on d4? The point is that after 10... Rxd4 white has 11. Nb5 attacking d4 and c7 and after Rd7 which is the only way to meet both threats White has Ne5 attacking the rook again with advantage.

The Bd2 also takes the d2 square away from the Nc4 so the only other square is 13. Na3 but b4 forking his knights on a3 and c3 seems strong.

Now he has surrendered his best minor piece the Bg2 which was proudly surveying the entire long white squared diagonal from h1 to a8. Now if the simple recapture Qxc6 White plays Ne5 and his knights on c3 and e5 in fact cover the white squares f3 e4 d5 and c6 and black is only slightly better. So I played an interesting exchange sacrifice which is not actually sound but takes some refuting!

A better move would be Bb3 then moving the queen up to the second file and sliding the rook behind it.. Or Bb3... then c4.

671,29,13,2Rd4,b'2k4r/1pp1bqpp/p3p3/4n1B1/3RN3/2P4P/P3QPP1/6K1 b - -',This move I'm not sure about.. I don't see how white garner's any advantage from moving his rook out. White's queen needs to take a more offensive role the only thing it's doing is protecting the knight when there is no piece on the board that can threaten it. I think Qe3 is a better move because it protects the bishop and at least threatens Qa7. 
672,29,14,2Re4,b'2k4r/1pp3pp/p3pq2/4n1N1/4R3/2P4P/P3QPP1/6K1 b - -',This is the misstep which costs white the game. Ne4 would have been better.. that threatens the queen and white needs to get his knight to the other side of the board.. as it that spot where his attack needs to go. White I suspect thought that he could win back the pawn.. Qxg5.. Rxe5.. forcing the queen to retreat and then equalizing material with Rxe6. What he didn't see however is c3 is exposed and the consequences of a highly mobile queen. 
673,29,15,2Kh2,b'2k4r/1pp3pp/p3p3/4R3/8/2P4P/P3QPPK/2q5 b - -',White doesn't want to let go of the choke hold he has on the e6 pawn..

The compelling question here is how could white have averted this attack? He needs to stop Qf4+.. Perhaps with the king.. although I would argue that all white needed to do was keep the queen on 2nd rank and move from there to attack black's exposed h and g pawns. 

Like to my opponent for the game.. it was a spirited contest. "
