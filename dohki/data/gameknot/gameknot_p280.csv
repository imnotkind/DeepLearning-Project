0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game  is from my appearance at the 2007 Alabama State Championship. I played in the Reserve (U1600) section and by some miracle broke even with a score of 3/6. The chess is not brilliant by any means but I did have a fun time hanging out with other chess heads. Game #1 was the lengthy one of the bunch going 57 moves and about 4 hours. It was a tiring but satisfying start to my first state championship. My opponent is a total stranger to me. He opens with 1. d4.
1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My preferred response.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This guy opens just like I do with white.  I wonder if he will go for QG?
3,0,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Ok come on.....throw me a gambit pawn.........
4,0,4,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',hmmm......White opts to activate his LSB. Truth be told this is not a line that I am familiar with as I generally play 3. c4 as white. 
5,0,5,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',Feeling that I had been given a little time I choose to spread open the queenside. Nc6 and Bg4 seem to hold some promise.
6,0,6,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Bolstering d4.
7,0,7,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Claiming yet more space locking in white's LSB and locking up the pawn structure.
8,0,8,b3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/1PP1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Attempting to unlock the pawn structure and gain more scope for his LSB.
9,0,9,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/1p1p4/2pP4/1PP1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq b6',Consistent with my pawn structure ideas but perhaps neglecting development.  Maybe 4...Ba6?
10,0,10,bxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/1p1p4/2PP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Starting some conflict while attempting to gain some range for his LSB.

12,0,12,Nbd2,b'rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',?! White really has to get something going here. While this move does develop where can this knight go next? Is he worried about my nice e4 post? I think 7. Be2 followed by 0-0 is better here.
13,0,13,Ba3,b'r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"Ok ok....the whole ""freezing same colored bishops"" thing. White makes this move to develop while hindering my castling plans."

I figure that since my pieces and pawns are better placed than his I'll simply castle by hand and continue squeezing his already cramped position. 
20,0,20,1Bxf8,b'1r2kB1r/p4ppp/2n1pn2/q2p4/2pP2b1/2P1PN2/P2NBPPP/R1Q1K2R b KQk -',Of course.

27,0,27,Ne4,b'1r5r/p2k1ppp/4p1b1/q2pP3/P1p1n1P1/Q1P1P2P/3NBP2/R3K2R w KQ -',As this knight protects d5 black is encouraged it take it so he can play Qd6.

I don't want to even think about how close I was to losing it there at the end. Moves like his 48. Rb8  don't just fall into my lap too often. As this is the first time I've ever played in a 6 round tourney I tell myself that this game was just a warm up and I now face a 5 round tournament where I am virtually guaranteed 3 whites.  It's always nice to get a round 1 win with the black pieces. Concentrate on the positive I tell myself and move on to round 2............thx to Ronnie B. and I hope you enjoyed. - Thomas
87,1,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"This is the miniature of mini-games.  Since most people here seem fascinated with miniatures or spectacular and/or unusually mates I figured this is a good one to feature.  It is so simple it is often overlooked.  It is both quick and spectacular.  Hopefully you won't see this or any variant of it while playing an experienced player.  I certainly hope you are never on the receiving end of one of these!  It is usually referred to as the ""Fool's Mate"".

Has this simple mate ever really been played?  Yes plenty of times.  I've even delivered a number of variants before...because I enjoy teaching people how to play chess.

If you haven't come across a variant of this game in real life before then you have not played enough chess.  When playing beginners it is not an everyday occurrence but nonetheless it is quite common.

The problem arises from white voluntarily opening his e1-h4 diagonal to attack by Black's Queen.  1. f4 is not so bad but the follow up of 2. g4 is disastrous."
88,1,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1. ... e6 may not be the best move in of itself but it does opens an important diagonal for a Queen attack at h4.  He could have played 1. ... e5 too but that would likely prompt fxe5 and the game would have lasted longer than it did.  Longer versions of this mate are played quite often but the weakness that creates the opportunity is always the same.
89,1,2,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5PP1/8/PPPPP2P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',Always be careful when playing the g pawn especially in combination with the f pawn.  Carelessly playing the king-side pawns can get many players into trouble quickly.  This can happen at most anytime during the opening...so be careful.
90,1,3,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5PPq/8/PPPPP2P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Does this need further explanation?

If it ever happens to you let it be a lesson so that it never happens again. 

The King cannot move out of check the attacking piece cannot be captured nor can another of White's pieces move to block the attack.  It's checkmate.   It's usually not a good idea to move the f and g pawns out together like this. 

Either side can perform this mate (likely with additional moves) when those two pawns are move out together.   An open e1-h4 or e8-h5 diagonal when the King is block in by its own pieces provides the opportunity."

For most of the game the position was pretty much drawn so this game will not be interesting to those who want to see some wild action.

133,2,42,5h5,b'8/1p6/p5k1/3p3p/4pPP1/P1P4K/1P6/8 w - -',This will break up the two white pawn supporting each other. If white plays g5 ? then black plays e3 followed by h4 and the white will not be able to stop both passed pawns.

I was thinking the game would go something like this: kg4 kf6 f5 ke4 kg5 e3 f6 e2 f7 e1 = q f8 = q. With both queens back and now too much open space to avoid perpetual checks from either side.
135,2,44,5Ke3,b'8/1p6/p4k2/3p4/4pP2/P1P1K3/1P6/8 b - -',This move lost white the game. The black king can now move onto f5 and the f4 square is now open to move towards to in the future bringing on a zugswang sooner or later where black has to move away from e3 and lose the pawn on f4.
136,2,45,5b3,b'8/1p6/p7/3p1k2/4pP2/PPP1K3/8/8 b - -',It does not matter how many pawn moves white can make compared to black the black king can keep on moving between f5 and g4 until white runs out of moves and has to move his king.
137,2,46,5c4,b'8/8/p7/1p1p4/1PP1pPk1/P3K3/8/8 b - -',When I first was looking at this position and saw c4 I thought that the game was still a draw. If d x c4 then k x e4 and the black king cannot move too far away from the f pawn. If c3 then the black king can chase it down and white will not be able get in believe me I tried all possibilities they will not work because white can simply move a4 at the right time and black cannot win no matter where he has opposition the white king.
138,2,47,5bxc4,b'8/8/p7/3p4/1Pp1pPk1/P3K3/8/8 w - -',This move at first looks bad white can now simply play a4 and create two passed pawns that the black king cannot both chase down. While blacks passed pawns are all facing a white king in front of them that he can stop or can he ?
139,2,48,c3,b'8/8/p7/3p4/PP2pPk1/2p1K3/8/8 w - -',All seems good for white after c2 the king stops it with kd2.

Bd6 allows me to follow with Qe7 and Nd7 will allow me to start pushing back on the kingside.

Rc-d8 lessens the defence on the c5 pawn which cannot now have a pawn for support. Rf-d8 makes a later f5 pawn push less effective and leaves the c8 rook with nowhere to go. In each of these cases white can just play c4 and I have no threats.

Bd6 with the intent of Qe7 and Nd7 seems the only option with hopefully an f4 push to follow. With the knight and bishop defending c5 and e5 the rooks should be free to get some action again."

Up until now I felt my opponent had been playing quite well; he'd played an opening that phases me and had forced me into a series of uncomfortable defenses. Here his play begins to go wrong.

Black MUST keep the queen on the a2-g7 diagonal for defense. 26... Qf7 is probably best since white can't immediately harass it any further there; Rooks on the d-file prevent the queen-winning pin.
443,13,19,Rxa8,b'r5k1/p6p/1p1q1ppB/8/8/P5Pb/1Q3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Ouch. Chess games are often lost when one player can't bring himself to concede material and a won piece becomes a mating attack.

Anything black does with his rook or bishop will be met with any number of mating moves the most elegant being 31. Bg7#. The only way to delay is to sac the queen with 30...

505,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I'm Black in this game where I mistakenly took material and ended up having to fight for a draw but then miraculously I got lucky at the end and won.
506,17,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So far both sides have castled kingside but White has a lot more control of the center. I personally don't like putting many pawns in the center and instead I play flexible setups that will contest the center later. Even though I don't have much space I am more flexible and I can play to break in the center with e5 or c5.
507,17,2,a5,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/3p1np1/p7/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - a6',At first glance this move seems strange and unorthodox. I couldn't really think of a better move to do. I mainly wanted to stop b4. My plan was to play for a c5 boost with b6-c5 but after b6 b4 is annoying. This stops the annoying b4 and I can follow up with b6 and c5.
508,17,3,Nfd7,b'rnbq1rk1/1ppnppbp/3p2p1/p7/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This puts more control on the dark squares
509,17,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/3nppbp/1p1p2pB/p1p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w - c6',This move doesn't appear as strong now that White has the option of removing my fianchetto but the control of the dark squares remains the same if both dark-squared bishops are gone White will have simplified the control. This is sort of like the Kavutskiy variation of the Modern Defense but White sets up his pieces Bd3 c3 Na3 in that opening. Trading dark bishops usually isn't a problem for Black in the Kavutskiy variation.
510,17,5,1a3,b'rnbq1rk1/3nppbp/1p1p2pB/p1p5/3PP3/P1N2N2/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I'm not sure if playing for b4 should be White's best plan he already played Bh6 so it seems like White would want to trade bishops and think about starting a kingside pawnstorm
511,17,6,Bb7,b'rn1q1rk1/1b1nppbp/1p1p2pB/p7/3NP3/P1N5/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now the position has turned into a variation of Sicilian Dragon where Black hasn't played Nc6 and has made a lot of odd moves. White can play b4 here but after axb4 axb4 Na6 I can put pressure on the b-pawn and if Black advances the b-pawn then my knight gets an outpost on c5.
512,17,7,1Bc4,b'rn1q1rk1/1b1nppbp/1p1p2pB/p7/2BNP3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White moves his bishop to a more agressive square but I think it's better if White trades bishops and starts an attack f4-f5
513,17,8,1Na6,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nppbp/np1p2pB/p7/2BNP3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This stops b4 and makes way for Rc8 and also there are ideas of putting a knight on c5.
514,17,9,1Rfe1,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nppbp/np1p2pB/p7/2BNP3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Maybe White wants to trade bishops and play f4-e5 gaining space in the center.
515,17,10,Nc7,b'2rq1rk1/1bnnppbp/1p1p2pB/p7/2BNP3/PPN5/2PQ1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I know this move is terrible but I was probably moving through my games too fast and I made a lot of hasty moves but that happens a lot in correspondence chess.
516,17,11,1b4,b'2rq1rk1/1bnnppbp/1p1p2pB/p7/1PBNP3/P1N5/2PQ1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Since I blocked my rook's path White decides the pawn isn't needed to defend the bishop anymore and plays the b4 advance but like I mentioned before I can put pressure on the b-pawn and play Nc5 if White ever plays b5
517,17,12,Nc5,b'2rq1rk1/1b2ppbp/1p1p2pB/1Pn1n3/3NP3/1BN5/2PQ1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',White has given my knight the c5-square but he can remove my other knight with Bxg7 and f4. My knights aren't really dangerous so I need to find some kind of play quick before White generates some activity.
518,17,13,Nc4,b'2rq1rk1/4ppbp/1p1p2pB/1PnN4/2nNP3/8/2PQ1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',White delayed trading dark bishops for too long so now I can gain some tempo
519,17,14,Bxd4,b'2rq1rk1/4pp1p/1p1p2pB/1PnN2Q1/2nbP3/8/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Here I get two minor pieces for a rook which can be a crushing advantage in a lot of positions but White's rooks get active and my minor pieces take awhile to coordinate so White was able to get a lot of play and almost won.
520,17,15,Kxf8,b'2rq1k2/4pp1p/1p1p2p1/1PnN2Q1/2nbP3/8/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Qxf8 hangs the e-pawn

522,17,17,2Nb4,b'2rq2k1/R2npp1p/1p1p2pQ/1P6/1NnbP3/8/2P2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',White threatens Nc6 here so I should've played Bg7 and been safer and after that I shouldn't have any problems. My material advantage should be enough to win but I played more risky moves and White got a huge initiative. A material advantage is only useful if your extra pieces can coordinate well and my minor pieces cannot coordinate well at the moment.
523,17,18,2Nce5,b'2rq2k1/R2npp1p/1p1p2pQ/1P2n3/1N1bP3/8/2P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I decided to play the riskier variation where I threaten to play Ng4 but it is too greedy to grab more material and stall the coordination of my minor pieces.
524,17,19,2Kh1,b'2rq2k1/R2npp1p/1p1p2pQ/1P2n3/1N1bP3/8/2P2PPP/4R2K b - -',This move shocked me I thought Rf1 was probably the best move. Here I should just play Bxf2 and have a comfortable advantage of two minor pieces and a pawn for a rook but I played to win more material which gave White some tempo
525,17,20,2Kg1,b'2rq2k1/R2npp1p/1p1p2p1/1P6/1N1bP3/8/2PQ1nPP/4R1K1 b - -',The most I can get out of this is an exchange
526,17,21,3Nc6,b'2rq2k1/R2npp1p/1pNp2p1/1P6/3bP3/8/2PQ2PP/4nK2 b - -',because of my greediness White gets this tempo move in and my material advantage drops. This caused me to make a horrible move and give White winning chances in what should've been an easy win for me.
527,17,22,3Rxc6,b'3q2k1/R2npp1p/1prp2p1/1P6/3bP3/8/2PQ2PP/4nK2 w - -',Another hasty move. I should've played Qe8 and settled for a 1-pawn advantage after White takes my bishop and wins my trapped knight after this blunder White gets a passed pawn and gains a lot of tempo and almost wins  while my minor pieces cannot coordinate and can be picked off in their horrible positions.
528,17,23,3c3,b'2q3k1/R1P1pp1p/1p1p2p1/4n3/3bP3/2P5/3Q2PP/4nK2 b - -',This move makes way for Qa2 where White's major pieces are threatening on the open file. My minor pieces are too slow to stop that action and are virtually useless. Here I realized my only hope is to get my queen active and draw by perpetual check.
529,17,24,3Qa2,b'2q3k1/R1P1pp1p/1pnp2p1/8/3bP3/2P5/Q5PP/4nK2 b - -',White can afford to sacrifice the exchange because of the very strong passed pawn. After the trade White's queen on a7 can go to c8 and White will promote.
530,17,25,Kg7,b'2q5/Q1P1ppkp/1p1p2p1/8/3bP3/2P5/6PP/4nK2 w - -',My best bet is to get my king off the back rank so that I can play Qa6  if White plays Qb8 and manage a draw by perpetual check. I also thought about saving my minor pieces and going into an ending where I have two minors and three pawns (9 points) vs. a queen (9 points) but the queen will just dominate on the open board and win some pawns.
531,17,26,3cxd4,b'2q5/Q1P1ppkp/1p1p2p1/8/3PP3/8/6PP/4nK2 b - -',White removes my attacker of the g1-a7 diagonal so now White can probably escape the perpetual. My best chance to draw is to take a pawn to clear more space for my queen to find checks. 
532,17,27,3Kxg2,b'1Q6/2P1ppkp/qp1p2p1/8/3PP3/8/6KP/8 b - -',After this I knew I had succeeded in getting a draw there isn't really any way White can escape the checks after this.
533,17,28,Qe2+,b'1Q6/2P1ppkp/1p1p2p1/8/3PP3/8/4q1KP/8 w - -',Qxe4 is more risky because it gives White's king more space to roam and a better chance of escaping the checks. It doesn't matter how many pawns I win because White is going to queen if I stop checking and none of my pawns are close to promoting. White declined the draw and just when I thought there was no possible way I could win this he made a horrible blunder that loses the game immediately.
534,17,29,4Kh3,b'1Q6/2P1ppkp/1p1p2p1/8/3PP3/7K/4q2P/8 b - -',White should've realized that he couldn't escape the checks and settle for a draw but now White has just suicided his king by allowing me to draw him closer to my territory with tempo so that White's promotion threat is meaningless now.
535,17,30,h6,b'1Q6/2P1ppk1/1p1p2pp/8/3PP2K/5q2/7P/8 w - -',The only thing that beats a promotion threat is a mating threat. I will play g5# here if White promotes and all White can do is sacrifice his queen to stall his loss
536,17,31,4Qg4,b'8/4ppk1/1p1p2pp/8/3PP1QK/5q2/7P/8 b - -',This is the only way to stop the mating threat and after the queen trade I have an easy win because of my advantage in pawns.
537,17,32,Kf6,b'8/4pp2/1p1p1kpp/8/3PP1K1/8/7P/8 w - -',Probably more accurate to push the passed pawn immediately but that doesn't really matter in an easily winning position
538,17,33,f3,b'8/8/6pp/4p1k1/4P3/1p3p1P/3K4/8 w - -',White cannot stop both passed pawns so he resigned here.
539,18,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"The defining move of the French -- this is probably the first ""hypermodern"" opening in the sense that it doesn't challenge white's claim to the center directly at first but strikes back hard and invites white to overextend."
540,18,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',This move is the strong point of the French defense -- either bypass it (the advance 3. e5) capture it (3. exd4) or protect it (3. Nd2 or Nc3) but don't ignore it!
541,18,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I decide to develop this knight to its strongest square and defend the pawn.
542,18,3,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is known as the Winawer variation and is very hard for white to deal with as white's a long way from castling black threatens to win the e-pawn and it looks like white will be stuck with doubled pawns on the c-file.  What to do here?
543,18,4,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',At least this protects the pawn.
544,18,5,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',?!  This move is okay but I was expecting c5.  Black normally waits to capture until white does something to drive the bishop away (like a3) but I suppose Will didn't want to give me the chance to play something like Bd2.
545,18,6,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',This move is a lot less effective now.  I see I can win a pawn (temporarily) with dxc5 but the idea of having tripled pawns doesn't really appeal to me.  I'd rather develop some pieces.
546,18,7,Qg4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',A strong move forcing g6 (anything else loses at least 2 pawns).

627,19,0,Kg3,b'8/8/6K1/8/6b1/6k1/3q4/1R2R3 w - -',This is the starting position of the endgame study. Many players would think that this kind of ending is a draw since Black's material advantage isn't great but Black wins because the bishop and queen can coordinate well on the open board while White's rooks are stuck having to support each other. Black's idea is to overcome White's king with a mating attack that will eventually force White to sacrifice his rook for a bishop going into a simpler ending.
628,19,1,3Rb3+,b'8/8/6K1/8/6b1/1R4k1/3q4/4R3 b - -',White can also try Rg1  Kf4 Rgf1  Bf3 but Black can still dodge the rook checks and start a mating attack.
629,19,2,3Kf4,b'8/8/6K1/8/5kb1/1R6/3q4/4R3 w - -',You should use your king aggressively in the endgame since the power of a king increases when there aren't many pieces left on the board to mate an exposed king.
630,19,3,3Rbe3,b'8/8/6K1/8/5kb1/4R3/3q4/4R3 b - -',"After Rf1  Ke4 White has no more checks and his rooks are poorly coordinated. In this variation White's rooks are better coordinated to defend.
Supporting the rooks with Ree3? is a mistake because White isn't threatening any checks. Black gains a lot of tempo in the attack after Qd6  Kg7 Bh5 because White's rooks have to defend instead of threatening disrupting rook checks."
631,19,4,3Bf5+,b'8/8/6K1/5b2/5k2/4R3/3q4/4R3 w - -',Black's attack is slowly pushing White toward the edge. Once White's king is cornered it should be easy to find a mating tactic. White gets mated if he moves onto the edge Kh5 gets mated by Qh2  and Kh6 loses after Qg2 threatening unstoppable mate with Qg6# or Qg5#
632,19,5,3Kf6,b'8/8/5K2/5b2/5k2/4R3/3q4/4R3 b - -',Kf7 and Kg7 lose just as fast
633,19,6,Kg5,b'8/6K1/3q4/5bk1/8/4R3/8/4R3 w - -',Black's pieces just continue to surround the king while the rooks are only onlookers who can throw in annoying checks every now and then. Black wants to continue the mating attack with Qh6  Kf7 Qh7  forcing the king to the back rank. A queen and bishop is a powerful attacking combo on the open board.
634,19,7,3Re3e7,b'8/4R1K1/3q4/5bk1/8/8/8/4R3 b - -',White's best defensive chance is to place the rook where it can interfere with the queen's attack. Rg1  is just an annoying check because after Bg4 White has no more checks and cannot coordinate the rooks to defend as well. Even though White is going to lose anyway it's best to make it as hard as possible for the attacker to finish the attack because then they are more likely to screw up.
635,19,8,3Kg8,b'6K1/4R3/5q2/5bk1/8/8/8/4R3 b - -',White's rook on the 7th rank is a huge speedbump in Black's attack otherwise Black would have a lot of mating threats. Having 2 rooks is usually redundant in a position where they cannot be used as an attacking combo. Giving up your queen for 2 rooks should only be done if your rooks can become very active. 
636,19,9,3Qd4,b'6K1/4R3/8/5bk1/3q4/8/8/4R3 w - -',"This move blocks the annoying Rg1  and Black can easily block Rg7  with Bg6
Now that Black has the White king where he wants it the idea is to force White to give up the Exchange going into a simpler endging. If White disconnects his rooks then Black can sometimes find a tactic involving many checks that will eventually fork the king and rook."
637,19,10,3Kf7,b'8/4RK2/8/5bk1/3q4/8/8/4R3 b - -',After Rg7  Bg6 White has to reconnect his rooks and Black gains more time. It's better for White to move his king closer to the center.
638,19,11,3Bg6+,b'8/4RK2/6b1/6k1/3q4/8/8/4R3 w - -',This is where the tactics come in. Endgames without pawns are purely tactical because you have to exploit the superior attacking capability of a slight material advantage with tactics rather than exploiting the advantage by winning pawns and promoting.
639,19,12,3Kg8,b'6K1/4R3/6b1/6k1/3q4/8/8/4R3 b - -',After 38.Ke6 Bh5 Black's idea is to mate with Kg6 and Bg4# and Black will have a forking tactic to win a rook if White ever disconnects his rooks. White's only check would be 39.Re5  Kg6 (threatening Bg4#) 40.Rd5 Bg4  41.Kd6 Qf6  wins a rook.
640,19,13,3Qh4,b'6K1/4R3/6b1/6k1/7q/8/8/4R3 w - -',Black wants to get his king to h6 without there being any rook checks. The queen blocks Rh1 so Black's king is safe and agressively placed on h6. White's king cannot escape since Kf8 loses to Qh8#.
641,19,14,3Re1e6,b'6K1/4R3/4R1b1/6k1/7q/8/8/8 b - -',Checking allows Kh6 and an easy win because of the queen's potential to repeatedly check and once the queen gets to the back rank White must block with a rook to where Black's bishop can take.

42.Re8 loses to Kh6 threatening Qxg2# so Black has to play Rge7 to stop Be6  and Black wins with Bb1 because there is nothing stopping Ba2  White's e8 rook is stuck defending e7 and the e7 rook is stuck defending Qg7# so neither can interfere with Ba2 "
647,19,20,4Rge7,b'6K1/4R3/5q2/4Rb1k/8/8/8/8 b - -',White must stop Be6 without giving Black any other tactics.
648,19,21,4Kg6,b'6K1/4R3/5qk1/4Rb2/8/8/8/8 w - -',White's rooks are stuck supporting each other the queen and king are powerfully placed to stop attacks from the rooks so there really isn't anything White can do at this point. White's king is stalemated so all Black needs to do is get in a bishop check such as a Bd3-Bc4  maneuver.
649,19,22,4Re5e1,b'6K1/4R3/5qk1/5b2/8/8/8/4R3 b - -',All White can do is maneuver the rook along the e-file and threaten the annoying Rg1  which makes it so that Black has to spend many extra moves recoordinating his pieces.
650,19,23,4Bg4,b'6K1/4R3/5qk1/8/6b1/8/8/4R3 w - -',White's e7 rook is stuck defending against Qg7# and blocking Qd8  so White can only move his other rook. All Black needs is one bishop check to win but first he needs to block rook checks and limit White's options.

After R1e4 Bd1 threatens Bb3  and once again the bishop is invincible since one rook defends against Qg7# while the other rook defends against Qxe7 Black will win a rook if White takes the bishop.
The text move doesn't allow the bishop check maneuver since it threatens Rg3  if the bishop moves."
652,19,25,4Qd4,b'6K1/4R3/6k1/8/3q2b1/4R3/8/8 w - -',Black's superior attacking forces have proven too much for White's pieces to handle. Having a queen and minor piece for 2 rooks is usually a crushing advantage and the rooks will end up defenseless. White's rooks are stuck on the e-file because if White only has 1 rook on the e-file then Qd8  will be mate. The e7-rook is still stuck defending against Qg7# so moving the e3-rook along the e-file is all White can do. Kf8 loses to Qh8#

White's defensive options are quickly slimming down which is what happens in a lot of pawnless chess endings. The superior pieces have more move options and better coordination while the weaker pieces are struggling just to find 1 defensive resource. When the weaker side runs out of moves they often find themself in zugswang. There are a lot of zugswang tactics in pawnless endgames."
654,19,27,Qd6,b'4R1K1/8/3q2k1/4R3/6b1/8/8/8 w - -',"White's rooks are running out of defensive power. White can only move his e5 rook because if R8e7 then Qb8  Re8 Qb3  Kh8 (Kf8 Qf7#) Qh3  Kg8 Qh7  Kf8 Qf7#
White should defend the 7th rank with the e5-rook since other moves along the e-file allow Qd5  Kh8 (Kf8 Qf7#) Qh5  Kg8 Qh7  Kf8 Qf7#"
655,19,28,Qf6,b'4R1K1/4R3/5qk1/8/6b1/8/8/8 w - -',This is similar to the positions after move 41 where Black is trying to get in a bishop check except now White's rooks are forced to defend unlike after move 41 where White's rooks can be disruptive. White has nothing because the e8-rook must support the e7-rook and the e7-rook is defending Qg7# White's e7-rook can only move along the 7th rank allowing Be6  so Black's win is clear now. The superior attacking pieces have forced zugswang so that the defenders are forced to disrupt the defense.
656,19,29,4Ra7,b'4R1K1/R7/5qk1/8/6b1/8/8/8 b - -',I will compare the continuation with positions where White's rook is on c7 or b7
657,19,30,4Be6+,b'4R1K1/R7/4bqk1/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',The long awaited bishop check has finally come in and Black has won the exchange going into a simpler ending.

Queen vs. rook is always a win but most positions are more complicated where the queen has to use technique to force the king away from the rook and then the queen can win the rook with a forking tactic. If the rook was on b7 here then the queen wins the rook with Qc8 .
If The rook was on c7 here then the queen wins the rook with Qd6  Re7 Kf6.
There is almost always a rook winning tactic in queen vs. rook when the king and rook are not supporting each other."
659,19,32,5Kf6,b'5K2/R7/4qk2/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Black can win the rook with Qc8  Ke7 Qc5  fork but if you want to be more accurate this move mates faster by forcing the rook to a square where it can be won on the 7th rank so that Black's queen is already in a mating position. Black has forced mate in 3 moves.
660,19,33,Qf7#,b'5K2/5q2/5k2/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Endgames without pawns are purely tactical and you must have good tactics in order to play them correctly. Black started with only a 2-point material advantage but ended up forcibly winning both rooks for only the bishop because of the tactics the stronger attacking units were able to unleash upon the weaker defensive units.

For lower-rated players to whom draws are rarer it should offer chances for both sides though. As should any other opening.

Black gets some pawn for the piece but the compensation is inaquate as black will find it hard to complete his queenside developement. 4...Ne4 is the normal move when white can play 5.Qxd4 or 5.Bb5!?
665,20,4,Qxb4+,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/1q6/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black could have castled and started normal developement with ...Nc6 and ...d6. Objectively this is equally good but then again then black would simply play piece down. At least this brings some chaos on the board.

668,20,7,Be2,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1q4n1/5N2/P2NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I thought this move for a long time and my thoughts went something like this: As the e5 pawn is likely to be removed and black is ready to castle I didn't want to give black any free tempi by playing Rf8-e8 with a check. I considered 9.Bc4 with the threat of Ng4 but I wanted to answer ...Qc5 with Ne4 but the bishop on c4 would then be en prisé. 
669,20,8,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1q4n1/5N2/P2NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black had many options here and as this move lands black in trouble maybe should've played e6 or Nc6.

It is true that black will pick a pawn or two but I had no intention of going into an endgame where queenside pawns mattered. After analysing some variations I deceided that white can build such an activity that it just must be enough.

963,32,6,Bxf3,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/1b6/2NPPb2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Like I said before bishops are usually better than knights because of their long range capabilities. Trading a bishop for a knight will weaken a color which can be exploited by your opponent's extra bishop of that color. It is less common that a knight will be better than a bishop unless the position is very closed making a bishop hemmed in by its own pawns or sometimes the bishop's handicap of not being able to step off its color will become an issue. Bishops are generally better than knights but this early in the game it isn't a big deal the advantage is more clear when pawns are traded and the bishops become mobile on the open board while the knight's ability to hop over pieces becomes less important.

I think it's better if Black castles kingside because then it's hard to attack him from there and Black can focus more on his space advantage. When Black castles queenside it's easier for me to attack so Black has less time to exploit his space advantage.
966,32,9,a3,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/1b6/P1NPPB2/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Maybe I should've delayed on this move since now Black is less likely to castle queenside once he sees my attacking possibilities after b4.
967,32,10,Bxc3,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/8/P1bPPB2/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',If Black retreats then I'll play b4 and b5 followed by maybe a4 or c4 and I have initiative on the queenside.
968,32,11,1Bxc3,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/8/P1BPPB2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I didn't want to play bxc3 because it makes my dark-bishop less active but opening the b-file was probably my best choice since more open positions benefit the bishops. Here Black doesn't have to let me open the position so the knights might become superior to the bishops since my bishops are contained by pawns.
969,32,12,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/8/P1BPPB2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? This is definitely a mistake because I can start an attack by pushing my b and a-pawns easily. Castling kingside was better since attacking with my g and h-pawns would be weakening to my position.
970,32,13,1b4,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/1P6/P1BPPB2/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',Advancing the queenside pawns won't weaken my position at all. Usually you only castle on the opposite side of your opponent if you want to start attacking their king without weakening your own king. Here Black is not in a position to start a quick attack while I am.
971,32,14,1Qb1,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1nq1n2/3pp3/1P6/P1BPPB2/2P2PPP/RQ3RK1 b - -',Hoping to play b5 and open the position.
972,32,15,1a4,b'2kr3r/2p2ppp/p1nq1n2/1p1pp3/PP6/2BPPB2/2P2PPP/RQ3RK1 b - -',Black has wasted moves trying to stop me from opening the position to his king but I'm going to get an open file sooner or later. It's not too late for Black to walk his king to the kingside but Black kept his king in danger on the queenside to hope to consolidate a defense but that defense deactivated all of Black's army I was able to exploit.
973,32,16,1d4,b'3r3r/1kp2ppp/p1nq1n2/1p1pp3/PP1P4/2B1PB2/2P2PPP/RQ3RK1 b - -',Even though makes my dark-bishop bad I wanted to activate my light-bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal to attack Black's weak queenside pawns. 
974,32,17,1e4,b'3r3r/1kp2ppp/p1nq1n2/1p1p4/PP1Pp3/2B1PB2/2P2PPP/RQ3RK1 w - -',exd4 is probably better even though opening a position should benefit the bishops it gives Black more space to come up with some counterplay unlike in this closed position Black's only chance is a do or die kingside attack but my threats on the queenside are too quick.
975,32,18,1Be2,b'3r3r/1kp2ppp/p1nq1n2/1p1p4/PP1Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BPPP/RQ3RK1 b - -',This attacks the b-pawn and bxa4 isn't good because I can open the position more with b5 later. If Black defends the b-pawn then he only lets me open 1 file but defending with Kb6 isn't good because after axb5 axb5 Qa2 Black has to play Ra8 to stop my threats then I can get 2 rooks for my queen and my rooks just dominate the a-file.
976,32,19,axb5,b'3r3r/nkp2ppp/3q1n2/1p1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BPPP/RQ3RK1 w - -',Nxb5 was a lot better because my pieces cannot slip in easily and Black has time to defend his weaknesses. axb5 is pretty much a blunder because that completely opens the a-file so my threats come 1 right after the other and Black never has time to generate counterplay.
977,32,20,1Ra5,b'3r3r/nkp2ppp/3q1n2/Rp1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BPPP/1Q3RK1 b - -',I can triple my major pieces on the a-file with tempo.
978,32,21,Rda8,b'r6r/nk3ppp/2pq1n2/Rp1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/Q1P1BPPP/5RK1 w - -',This is the most solid defense since Nc8 gives me too much control of the a-file but when Black defends like this his pieces become totally inactive where I can exploit my superiorly coordinated pieces. Nc8 is probably better since Black doesn't have to defend so passively and has a better chance to recover from the attack.
979,32,22,Qb8,b'rq5r/nk3ppp/2p2n2/Rp1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/Q1P1BPPP/R5K1 w - -',I've gained a lot of tempo in the attack and devalued Black's pieces. The rook on a8 is completely immobile and surrounded by pieces that cannot leave the defense of the other immobile pieces. In positions like this the attacker has to find the right moves to slowly squeeze the opponent out of defensive options.
980,32,23,2Ra6,b'rq5r/nk3ppp/R1p2n2/1p1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/Q1P1BPPP/R5K1 b - -',There isn't any other way to make progress. My intent is to come to a5 with my queen and threaten Rb6  where the only defense is Nd7 since the other pieces cannot move.
981,32,24,2Nd7,b'rq5r/nk1n1ppp/R1p5/1p1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/Q1P1BPPP/R5K1 w - -',Black will have to make this move anyway and this makes way for f5 to start a pawnstorm on the kingside. I'm pretty sure I can capitalize on my superiorly coordinated pieces before Black can make progress on the kingside.
982,32,25,2Qa5,b'rq5r/nk1n1ppp/R1p5/Qp1p4/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BPPP/R5K1 b - -',Black has 5 immobile pieces clumped on the queenside. The queen or king cannot move because they have to defend the a7-knight which also can't move because it's blocking the immobile rook and now Black's other knight is paralyzed since it defends against Rb6 . My 3 major pieces have demobilized most of Black's army. Black's only mobile piece is the h8-rook that cannot do much damage so I have him where I want him. The only way I can overcome Black's clump of immobile pieces is if I can somehow get my bishops active in attacking Black's defensive pieces. 
983,32,26,2f5,b'rq5r/nk1n2pp/R1p5/Qp1p1p2/1P1Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BPPP/R5K1 w - f6',This defends against Bg4 attacking Black's immobile knight. In order to get my bishops active to complete the attack I need to first open the position since my bishops cannot do anything when they are blocked by pawns in this closed position. f5 blocks the diagonal to the immobile knight but there is nothing blocking Black's immobile queen on the h2-b8 diagonal so it would be crushing if I could place a bishop on that diagonal.
984,32,27,2f3,b'rq5r/nk1n2pp/R1p5/Qp1p1p2/1P1Pp3/2B1PP2/2P1B1PP/R5K1 b - -',"This move prepares for a Be1-Bg3 maneuver. Attacking an immobile piece is the key to cracking any defense. Black can try stopping my bishops' infiltration with 22...exf3 23.Bxf3 h5 24.Be1 h4 but I can force open the position with 25.g3 after 25...h3 26.g4 the only thing stopping Bg3 is f4 but Black's position falls apart after I win that pawn. If 25...g5 instead of 25...h3 then 26.g4 forces open the centre since I'll trade pawns on f5 and then breakthrough with d4.

Black's main mistake was castling on an unsafe area of the board allowing me to start an attack. Even though my attack wasn't immediately decisive I was able to increase the pressure against Black's immobile pieces until I could force open the position and get in 1 more attacker to finish the job. Had the position been completely locked with pawns and unable to be opened then Black's defense would've held.

I was banking on the principle that black was behind in development with his king in the centre so forcing the centre open like this should be correct.

1062,36,22,2Nc3,b'r6r/1p4pp/p1k5/P1pR4/2p5/2N2P2/1P4PP/R5K1 b - -',The knight re-emerges holding the white position together.
1063,36,23,2Rhe8,b'r3r3/1p4pp/p1k5/P1pR4/2p5/2N2P2/1P4PP/R5K1 w - -',I think that this was a mistake and that black should have challenged for the d-file. The exchange of a pair of rooks might have increased his drawing chances. Allowing white to double rooks was dangerous given black's exposed king.
1064,36,24,Re7,b'r7/1p2r1pp/p1k5/P1pR4/2p5/2N2P2/1P4PP/3R2K1 w - -',To meet the threat of Rd7 followed by R1d6#

1070,36,30,Kd8,b'1r1k4/R5p1/7p/8/2p1N3/5P2/1P4PP/6K1 w - -',...Kc6 might have been slightly better with the possibility of supporting the c-pawn; the king will now be cut off on the back rank.
1071,36,31,c2,b'3k4/8/2R5/8/4N3/4KP2/1rp3PP/8 w - -',....Rxg2 was the only chance to reduce the material deficit slightly.
1072,36,32,4Kxc1,b'3k4/8/2R5/8/4N3/5P2/1r4PP/2K5 b - -',I thought my opponent might resign at this point as that pawn was his last whiff of counterplay. However he decides to play on as he is entitled to do. He starts naturally by clawing back one of the white pawns.
1073,36,33,4Rc2,b'3k4/8/8/8/4N3/5P2/2R3rP/2K5 b - -',Releasing the black king but with the aim of driving the rook to an unfavourable position.
1074,36,34,Rh1,b'3k4/8/8/8/4N3/5P2/2RK3P/7r w - -',The rook is  behind the pawn but very short of space. My strategy will be to keep it there and push the other pawn instead.
1075,36,35,5Rg2,b'8/4k3/8/8/4N3/4KP2/6RP/7r b - -',Not fully consistent but i wanted to occupy this file before black did.
1076,36,36,5Kf4,b'8/8/4k3/8/4NK2/5P2/6RP/7r b - -',In this position black resigned (1-0). Neither his king nor his rook seems to have any good move to stop white advancing his pawns.

1078,37,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Graeme's head would spontaneously combust if he played anything other than 1. e4 against me. Lately I've been exploring the Caro Kann. I'm quite sure he expected 1...d5:)
1079,37,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Heading into Two Knight's territory which is giving me fits as I learn this system. Main line reflects 2. d4.
1080,37,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Consistent with the 1. c6 theme.
1081,37,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A very interesting choice. White appears to want to lock down the pawn structures early. I was really expecting 3. Nc3.
1082,37,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Developing quickly and clearing d7 for my Nb8.

1084,37,7,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is a prototypical pawn structure of a Caro Kann. At first glance (at least to me) it's just not that sexy. However what this position lacks in pizzaz it more than makes up for with potential. Black can get fully developed relatively quickly and many times can delay castling or even forego castling very safely. This is definitely a defensive system for black.
1085,37,8,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I think I have correctly assumed that blackbaron is out of his comfort level as well. Since the Two Knights is not in effect he simply hastens 0-0 with a good developing move. When you have played the same opponent so many times you get a feel for his play. This is all new ground to us. The exciting part of chess is exploring new lines of play with cool adversaries:)
1086,37,9,a6,b'rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?! The first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem. I am continually PLAGUED by voices inside my head telling me to play moves like this. I opt to neglect development and prepare b5 because I feel the kingside can hold for a bit. Somebody.....please.......stop me! Is there a pill for this behavior?
1087,37,10,h3,b'rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Putting the question to my bishop which I feel is proper.

This move was made at about 4 am his time after he crawled back home from a night at the local pub. I won't include all of the language he used but it is evident that he intended to play 0-0. Tragic drunken mouse slip. Sorry buddy.......

1142,37,65,6Ka3,b'8/3k4/p3pP2/P2pP1n1/2pP4/K1P5/8/8 b - -',Can he be trying to infiltrate c5? To what end?
1143,37,66,Nd8,b'3n4/2k5/p3pP2/P2pP3/1KpP4/2P5/8/8 w - -',! Still protecting f7 and preparing to throw a check if needed.
1144,37,67,Kd7,b'8/1n1k4/p3pP2/P2pP3/1KpP4/2P5/8/8 w - -',Back to babysitting.
1145,37,68,Nd6,b'8/5k2/p2npP2/P2pP3/K1pP4/2P5/8/8 w - -',! I spent an hour or so on this one. If he takes his f pawn falls first followed by his d6 pawn after Kf7 and rushing pawns up the board allows my king to get to his a pawn while he defends. That position however is most likely drawn. In playing this move I almost concede the draw.
1146,37,69,6Ka3,b'8/5k2/p2npP2/P2pP3/2pP4/K1P5/8/8 b - -',I think my opponent gives me too much credit:)
1147,37,70,Kg6,b'8/8/p3pPk1/P2pP3/2pPn3/2P5/1K6/8 w - -',A waiting move as I have now calculated out the pawn captures after I sac my knight.
1148,37,71,Nxf6,b'8/8/p3pnk1/P2pP3/2pP4/2P5/2K5/8 w - -',! Ok buddy let's just cut to the chase........
1149,37,72,7Kd2,b'8/8/p3pnk1/P2pP3/2pP4/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',? Loses the game. Again I think my opponent got too wrapped up in my game and failed to see that a draw was still very possible. The rest of the game is pretty straightforward.
1150,37,73,c3,b'8/8/p3p3/Pn1pPk2/3P4/2p1K3/8/8 w - -',"""A passed pawn is a thing of joy forever"" That was Keats wasn't it?"
1151,37,74,Qa3#,b'8/8/p3p3/Pn1pP3/K2P4/q7/3k4/8 w - -',Many thanks to my old friend for the game and I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
1152,38,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I usually play Caro-Kann - c7-c6 but for this game decided to experiment...
1153,38,1,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/2p5/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White normally exchanges the bishop the retreat allows black to expand on the queenside with tempo... 
1154,38,2,1a4,b'r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/p1np1np1/1pp5/P3PB2/1BPP1N2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - a3',Interesting move. Probably the only one that claims some sort of advantage but with careful play black maintains equality. 
1155,38,3,e5,b'r2q1rk1/1b3pbp/p1np1np1/1pp1p1N1/P3PB2/1BPP4/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - e6',Interestingly e6 is bad because of 12. B:e6 fe 13. N:e6 and white gets two pawns and a rook for two light pieces. 
1156,38,4,1Bxf7+,b'r2q1rk1/1b3Bb1/p1np1npp/1pp1p1N1/P3P3/2PP2B1/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Wrong. White gives up material. At the same time I must admit that when picking up the bishop I did not see that white could get a pawn on b5 after the exchange of pawns and a check from b3 with a queen... :)
1157,38,5,1Rxa8,b'R2q4/1b3kb1/2np1npp/1pp1p3/4P3/2PP2B1/1P3PPP/1N1Q1RK1 b - -',Here I had a choice. If I took with a queen I had ideas of penetrating the white queenside. However this is where I saw the check from b3 and decided to keep the queen close to the center. 
1158,38,6,1f4,b'b2q4/5kb1/2np1npp/1pp1p3/4PP2/2PP2B1/1P4PP/1N1Q1RK1 b - f3',Good move opening  a line for the rook. 
1159,38,7,1Bxf4,b'b2q4/5kb1/2np1npp/1pp5/4PB2/2PP4/1P4PP/1N1Q1RK1 b - -',Here c5-c4 was an option but with an open line for the rook and no mood for calculations... :) I decided to hide the king and give up a pawn... 
1160,38,8,2Qe6,b'b2q4/6bk/2npQnpp/1pp5/4PB2/2PP4/1P4PP/1N3RK1 b - -',Wow! Totally unexpected. This is when I started taking the game seriously. I was expecting Nd2 (which as game shows later was necessary...) but with such a drastic centralisation of the white queen I suddenly have few squares to defend. After long (20 minutes or so) deliberations I decided to play Ne5. Interesting sequence would be 20...Ne5 21. B:e5 de 22. Q:e5 and here N:e4 seemingly a nice move comes across simple 23. Rf7. Hmmm interesting...
1161,38,9,2Qf7,b'b2q4/5Qbk/5npp/1pp1p3/4P3/2PP4/1P4PP/1N3RK1 b - -',Now this is interesting. Second time when I sat down and calculated different options after ambitious (and as it turned out after calculations - winning) 22. Q:d3. Decision taken. 
1162,38,10,Qxe4,b'b7/5Qbk/5Rpp/1pp1p3/4q3/2P5/1P4PP/1N4K1 w - -',Boom and double threat of checkmate on g2 and hanging knight on b1 decides the game. C'est tout!
