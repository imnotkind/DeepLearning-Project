0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',IN this game I attack white's bishop while at the same time threatening his b2 square. The b2 threat was the more dangerous one since taking the bishop would allow him to fork my king and knight to win the piece back. So he moves the bishop and suffers the consequences. Annotation Updated Wednesday July 21 2010.
1,0,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I personally like the Pirc Kings Indian and Benoni defenses. This game I'm playing the Pirc.
2,0,2,Nh3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"White made a knight move to the side of the board (this is usually a bad move though there are exceptions). He most likely had the intention of playing Ng5 to attack my f-pawn. Of course the 2nd Knight move if allowed would get the piece back in the game. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped closed positions while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually but generally pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening become open positions in the middle game and end game. So although both pieces are technically the same value the bishops are my piece of choice. Yet in this case the advantage gained far outweighs the loss of a bishop. He must capture toward the outside of the board deserting crucial central squares. In addition he will have double pawns on the h-file which will be easy prey in the endgame. Thus my next move 4. ... Bxh3.

On the other hand he gets an open g-file. So to prevent any attacks on my king I planned to castle queen side.

(The advantages mentioned I never capitalized on because after he castled on the queen side I was able to chase his king back into the middle of the board where I would have mated had he not resigned.)"
3,0,3,cxd5,b'rn2k2r/ppq1ppbp/3p1np1/3p4/2B1PB2/2N4P/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Giving a discovered attack on his bishop so he has to take the pawn with his bishop or play the better move 9. Bb5+.
4,0,4,Bb5+,b'rn2k2r/ppq1ppbp/3p1np1/1B1p4/4PB2/2N4P/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Good for him.
5,0,5,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppqnppbp/3p1np1/1B1P4/5B2/2N4P/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R w KQ -',See note on white's move 4.
6,0,6,Nb6,b'2kr3r/ppq1ppbp/1n1p1np1/1B1P4/5B2/2N4P/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R w KQ -',I do prefer my bishops (no really I do). But in this case white's light square bishop is very restricted. So I did not want him to play Bxd7 eliminating his bad bishop. I plan after this knight move to play a6 chasing the bishop. I am not concerned about 12. ... a6 13. Bxa6 ... bxa6 14. Qxa6 + (busting open my kings defenses) because he did not have enough fire power to followup on the sac. With a queen and knight already in the area I felt sure I could get my pieces over to defend in sufficient time.
7,0,7,a6,b'2kr3r/1pq1ppbp/pn1p1np1/1B1P4/5B2/2N4P/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R w - -',See note on black's previous move.
8,0,8,1Bxa6,b'2kr3r/1pq1ppbp/Bn1p1np1/3P4/5B2/2N4P/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R b - -',He's going for it just as I planned! He'll have 2 pawns for a bishop and no real attack. In addition with the 2 double pawns on the h-file his pawns are nullified so I see myself with a full bishop lead after 13. Bxa6 bxa6 14. Qxa6+ Qb7.
9,0,9,1Qe2,b'2kr3r/1q2ppbp/1n1p1np1/3P4/5B2/2N4P/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R b - -',Being down in material now it would not be good for him to trade.
10,0,10,1Nfxd5,b'2kr3r/1q2ppbp/1n1p2p1/3n4/5B2/2N4P/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R w - -',The pawn is insufficiently defended but I also wanted to open the bishop diagonal and queen b-file to hit b2.
11,0,11,1Bg5,b'2kr3r/1q2ppbp/3p2p1/3n2B1/8/7P/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R b - -',He did not need to move the Bishop. If 17. ... NxB then 18. Qc5+ and 19. QxB (still on f4). What he needed was to defend b2 instead (17. Qc4+... followed by 18. Qb3. After the queen trade he'd have double pawns but my attack would be lessened for now or he could play 17. c3 ).
12,0,12,1Bxb2+,b'2kr3r/1q2pp1p/3p2p1/3n2B1/8/7P/PbP1QP1P/2KR3R w - -',Now: 18. Kb1 Nc3# or 18. Kd2 Qb4+ 19. Kd3 Qd4# or 19. c3 Qxc3#
13,0,13,Qb4+,b'2kr3r/4pp1p/3p2p1/3n2B1/1q6/7P/PbPKQP1P/3R3R w - -',And White resigns as 19. Kd3 Qd4# or 19. c3 QxP#.

I have just returned from a nice holiday in sunny Bognor Regis - the last 3 days have been lovely with the sea at West Wittering being like a Turkish Bath.  Well after that relaxing break it is time to catch up on my moves and do a bit more annotating.  I have been giving considerable thought to the feedback I received after my last annotation.  I was so chuffed with the new toy Gameknot Analysis that I thought I would use it.  However with the use of it it started to detract from useful comments so much so that my previous annotation was as impressive as the United Kingdom's performance in the Eurovision Song Contest.  I will remedy this by posting the Gameknot Analysis Version here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13490591&rnd=0.09771577577484708 and give normal commentary from now on."
15,1,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - here are some pretty standard moves of the Sicilian Defense.  Am I gonna get the Naijdorf or the Dragon?  I have mixed results from both these systems.
16,1,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ...... a6 - hmm the Naijdorf.
17,1,3,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',6. Be3 - enter Fou Lenoir!  I am keeping my options open as to where to put Henry so I am clearing the decks as quickly as possible.
18,1,4,Qd2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',9. Qd2 - this system is transposing into the Fisher-Byrne Attack.  Glenda is eyeing up the backward pawn on d6 with interest.  Next move I will castle queenside and pile up on that little footman.
19,1,5,a5,b'rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p3p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',10. ........ a5 - hmm who's attacking who?

21,1,7,1Kb1,b'r2qnrk1/1p1nbppp/3pb3/pB2p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP1Q1PP/1K1R3R b - -',13. Kb1 - Henry bolsters the defense of the a2 pawn.

23,1,9,1Bg5,b'r1q2rk1/1pn1bppp/3pbn2/p3p1B1/B3P2P/1NN2P2/PPP1Q1P1/1K1R3R b - -',16. Bg5 - a pin but it is not as innocuous as it looks.....

26,1,12,2Nd5,b'r1q2rk1/1p2bpp1/n3b2p/p2Np3/B3P2P/1N3P2/PPP1Q1P1/1K1R3R b - -',20. Nd5 - threatening to win the exchange with a fork on b6.

29,1,15,2Qc4,b'r2b1rk1/1p3pp1/7p/p3p3/Bnq1P2P/1N3P2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - -',23. ..... Qc4 - the Wicked Witch moves in closer aargh!
30,1,16,2Bb3,b'r4rk1/1p2bpp1/7p/p3p3/1nq1P2P/1B3P2/PPPQ2P1/1KNR3R b - -',"25. Bb3 - ah but I now have a Witch Ejection Plan up my sleeve Fou Leblanc yells ""Begone you evil besom!""  The Witch flies back to c7 - I must still take care even though Henry seems well protected.  Hmm maybe if I put up this defensive formation when playing against the Master Mater it will sentence him to a few days of head scratching!"

33,1,19,Qxd6,b'r5k1/4bpp1/2nq3p/pp2p1P1/4P2P/1BP2P2/PP4Q1/1KN4R w - -',30. ...... Qxd6 - the rook move to d6 met that threat but as I am a pawn up I decided to trade rooks.
34,1,20,3g6,b'r5k1/4bpp1/2nq2Pp/pp2p3/4P2P/1BP2P2/PP4Q1/1KN4R b - -',31. g6 - now putting pressure on the pinned pawn on f7.
35,1,21,3Nd8,b'r2n2k1/4bpp1/3q2Pp/pp2p3/4P2P/1BP2P2/PP4Q1/1KN4R w - -',31. ..... Nd8 - drat that pesky knight!
36,1,22,3Rg1,b'r2n2k1/4bpp1/3q2Pp/pp2p3/4P2P/1BP2P2/PP4Q1/1KN3R1 b - -',32. Rg1 - I keep up the pressure on the g column.

38,1,24,Kxf7,b'1r6/5kp1/5b1p/pp2p2P/4P3/2P2P2/PP6/1KN3R1 w - -',37. ..... Kxf7 - I have avoided the opposite colour bishops but can my knight prove stronger than black's bishop?  We shall see.
39,1,25,3Nd3,b'1r6/5kp1/5b1p/pp2p2P/4P3/2PN1P2/PP6/1K4R1 b - -',38. Nd3  - looks a good start puts pressure on the isolani on e5 and improves the scope of the white knight.
40,1,26,Bg5,b'2r5/5kp1/7p/pp2p1bP/4P3/P1PN1P2/1P6/1K4R1 w - -',39. .... Bg5? - an oversight dropping another pawn!  I now take immediate advantage.
41,1,27,4Ng6,b'2r5/6p1/5kNp/pp4bP/4P3/P1P2P2/1P6/1K4R1 b - -',41. Ng6 - this knight entrenches himself on g6 to support a possible advance of my passer to e5.  Getting this pawn to Glendadom however is by no means a simple task however.
42,1,28,4Re2,b'2r5/6p1/5kNp/p6P/1p2P3/P1P1bP2/1P2R3/1K6 b - -',43. Re2 - thought I would annoy the black bishop before trading queenside pawns.
43,1,29,Bxb4,b'2r5/6p1/5kNp/7P/1b2P3/5P2/1P2R3/1K6 w - -',45. ..... Bxb4 - this trade has now resulted in me getting another passer on the queenside.
44,1,30,4f4,b'2r5/6p1/5kNp/7P/1b2PP2/8/1P2R3/1K6 b - -',46. f4 - this pawn move stops the black king getting to g5 and hassling my isolani on the h column.
45,1,31,4Kc2,b'4r3/6p1/5kNp/7P/1b2PP2/8/1PK1R3/8 b - -',47. Kc2 - I have a vague plan of getting Henry towards the kingside to bolster my e5 passer.  My queenside b2 passer will be used to tie black down as much as possible.
46,1,32,4Ke3,b'4r3/2b3p1/5kNp/7P/4PP2/4K3/1P2R3/8 b - -',49. Ke3 - as planned.
47,1,33,Rb8,b'1r6/2b3p1/5kNp/7P/4PP2/4K3/1P1R4/8 w - -',50. ..... Rb8 - putting pressure on my b2 passer.  Henry now heads for g4 but before he gets there my opponent suddenly decided that a two pawn deficit was too much and waved the white flag.  If you refer to the gameknot analysis link in my intro note you will see how big a positional advantage I had in the final.  My opponent recently held a Class A 1800+ rating like myself so I was really pleased with the result.  Hope you have had a good read - bye for now - Joanne

55,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This was a return game I had played against the same opponent with Black and drew in a complicated Najdorf. So I was determined to win this one especially since I had White.
56,3,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',The main reason why I played 1. d4 was because I saw that my opponent employs the Gruenfeld as his main defensive weapon to closed games.
57,3,2,Rb1,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/1RBQKB1R b Kkq -',This was very much en-vogue a few years back but it's hardly played now. I guess all the top GMs analysed to death the resulting variations.
58,3,3,Qa5+,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP3/5N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R w K -',The sharpest answer. Black snatches a pawn at the cost of a few tempos. The alternative is playing 9...Nc6 but that leads to a difficult middlegame for Black. I had the opportunity to play that line against ksasidhar and annotate my relatively fast win with the White pieces.
59,3,4,1Bd2,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP3/5N2/P2BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K -',11. Qd2 is the alternative but Black doesn't have much to worry about in the resulting endgames mainly because of his Q-side majority.
60,3,5,Bg4,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',The only other reasonable alternative is 12...Nd7 which concedes a lot of space to White at the cost of keeping the extra pawn.
61,3,6,1Bg5,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/6B1/3PP1b1/5N2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',13. Be3 is a good alternative.
62,3,7,1Be3,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppb1/6pp/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',For a while 14. Bh4 was played but I don't think very much of that move.
63,3,8,1e6,b'rn3rk1/pp3pb1/4p1pp/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',This is a strange move. I can only find one game in my database but White didn't chose the most critical follow-up. The move itself has some points it prevents d5 and prepares to develop the Nb8 to c6 but it has bigger things going against it. On one hand it's slow another pawn move when I am fully mobilized and Black still has pieces on the back rank and on the other hand should I play d5 a passed pawn will appear on the board much faster than before.
64,3,9,1Qd3,b'rn3rk1/pp3pb1/4p1pp/8/3PP1b1/3QBN2/q3BPPP/1R3RK1 b - -',A very flexible move connecting the Rooks and preparing d5. The immediate caputre 15. Rxb7 doesn't lead to anything but equality after 15...Nc6 16. h3 Bxf3 17. Bxf3 Rfd8 18. d5 Ne5 19. Qe2 Qxe2 20. Bxe2 exd5 21. exd5 Rxd5 22. Rxa7 Rax7 23. Bxa7 and despite the Bishop pair I have nothing.
65,3,10,1Qa4,b'rn3rk1/pp3pb1/4p1pp/8/q2PP1b1/3QBN2/4BPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Retreating the Queen to a safer spot.
66,3,11,1Rxb7,b'rn3rk1/pR3pb1/4p1pp/8/q2PP1b1/3QBN2/4BPPP/5RK1 b - -',Winning back the pawn sacrificed on move eleven. Besides recovering the material the Rook is menacing on the 7th rank and the pawn centre is still flexible. I'd say White has a pretty big edge in this position.
67,3,12,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/8/q2PP1b1/3QBN2/4BPPP/5RK1 w - -',Developing the last minor piece and putting pressure on d4.
68,3,13,1d5,b'r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P1b1/3QBN2/4BPPP/5RK1 b - -',Very typical move in this line White gets a passed d-pawn from the middlegame.
69,3,14,1Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P3/3QBb2/4BPPP/5RK1 w - -',This exchange is necessary in order to have a good place to retreat the Knight.
70,3,15,1gxf3,b'r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P3/3QBP2/4BP1P/5RK1 b - -',I took with the pawn mainly because I saw that I could double Rooks on the seventh rank and I didn't want to suffer from back rank tactics.
71,3,16,1Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P3/3QBP2/4BP1P/5RK1 w - -',A standard tactic delaying the pawn exchange and activating the Rook. The downside is that f7 is weakened.
72,3,17,1Rc1,b'r2r2k1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P3/3QBP2/4BP1P/2R3K1 b - -',The crucial tempo needed to invade the 7th rank with the other Rook.
73,3,18,1exd5,b'r2r2k1/pR3pb1/2n3pp/3p4/q3P3/3QBP2/4BP1P/2R3K1 w - -',It's slightly better to exchange a pair of pawns because Black might get some counterplay against my weak K-side.
74,3,19,Nd4,b'r2r2k1/pR3pb1/6pp/3P4/q2n4/3QBP2/4BP1P/2R3K1 w - -',The Knight was attacked and it had to go somewhere. Perhaps better was 20...Na5 removing one Rook from the seventh rank but the Knight might become stuck on the rim and trying to exchange a pair of Rooks after 20...Na5 21. Rb5 Rdc8 22. Rxc8+ Rxc8 23. d6 Nc8 24. Qd5 and f7 and a7 are horribly weak.

[here comes the pain...] exf3 20.Kf2 [the diagonal MUST be kept closed!]  Re8! and there's nothing to stop 21...Bxg3+! 22.hxg3 Re2+ opening the diagonal once again. However White ruins this simply be playing 19.dxe4! leaving him a pawn up an even more closed diagonal and two strong bishops!

However obviously there is no target pawn on d4 and e&c4 are supported. The d4 square is a 'hole' admittedly but this is usually adequately covered by pieces (potentially both Knights and the queens bishop) and Black can become quite fixated with it. White also has the option to play flexibly advancing on the queenside kingside or the centre.

The position is akin to a Veresov (1. d4 d5 2. Nc3) or potentially a French Defence.  Black's pawn on e4 can only be defended at the cost of a weaknesses at e6 and/or d6 in the event of ... f5 and White gets some open lines.

Be2 Bd7 10. d5 as +0.87 for Black. Personally I think that White has good compensation for his pawn in this line.  His king is safe his pieces are freer and he has f3 and g4 to prise open the K-side.  5. Bd7 is flexible and looks at playing ... e6 and .. c5 whilst keeping an eye on Bb5 threats in the event of ... Nc6.  The computer thinks that 6. Qh5 e6 6. 0-0-0 Bd6 is pretty equal.
331,19,4,a3,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1ppp/4p3/8/2BPpB2/P7/1PP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Is this a waste of tempo?  7. Qe2 Bd6 8. Nh3 0-0 9. 0-0-0 Re8 10. Re1 Bc6 11. d5 could leave Black's K-side a little fragile and there is the option of recapturing on e4 at moves 9/10 etc if White fancies it.  For my part I was thinking about ... b5 (which Qe2 would have prevented) but I'd probably have gone with 7. ... Bd7-c6-d5 and ... c5 to hold the pawn and to compete in the centre.  I don't see that Black needs to rush to 0-0 in this position - he can always 0-0-0 instead.
332,19,5,c5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/2p5/2BPpB2/P7/1PP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq c6',It seems sensible to attack the centre at this stage before playing ... Nc6 although the computer suggests  6. ... Bd6 7.

At a stroke Black frees himself of the weaknesses at e6 and e5 and grabs a share of f4 and d4.  The computer wants to grub around with 14. ... Kf7 which looks a bit grotty but the threat of ... Rd8 is actually rather difficult to meet.  15. Be3 Qe5 16. Qd2 Rd8 is on the face of it good for Black but I had an extra pawn and wanted a phalanx shoulder to shoulder to advance on the White king.  At this stage however I'd be lying if I thought I was better.  Equality first as Black then push on to win if you can.

Black might even be tempted to play Rxd5 and try to advance his pawns.  
At this stage I wasn't particularly confident about the outcome.  Black has an extra pawn but it's doubled and White has the bishop pair.  Can Black stop White playing 21. c5 and closing down his Q-side for good?  I think White is actually better here despite the nominal material difference."

White has to go backwards at this point.  22. cxb6 Rxd5 23. Rxd5 Rxd5 24. bxa7 Nxa7 and White's pawns go nowhere.  Suddenly I felt as if I might survive on the Q-side and take advantage.  Firstly though I wanted to get the rooks off because I thought that would minimise White's winning chances and give me the best chance in the endgame.

350,19,23,Bd8,b'3b4/pp2k2p/2n2p1B/2P1pp2/1P2p3/P7/5PPP/3B2K1 w - -',Now we have an interesting endgame.  This is one of those positions where it's worth stopping and looking at it.  White's pawns are more advanced but Black's king can get there first.  The Bh6 could find itself trapped if it's not careful and the Nc6 can hop into d4 where it dominates the board.  Much as I like the visceral thrill of a direct attack on the king this is a tense dynamic position. 
351,19,24,2f4,b'3b4/pp2k2p/2n2p1B/2P1pp2/1P2pP2/P7/6PP/3B2K1 b - f3',White blinks first. Giving Black a passed pawn can only end in trouble although the alternative sees Black play ... a5 and (if necessary) ... b6 to neutralise the Q-side.  White can pick up the h7 pawn but at a cost.  25. Bb3 a5 26. bxa5 Bxa5 27. Bg8 Kd7 28. h4 Bd8 30. Bf8 Be7 31. Bxe7 Kxe7 32. h5 Kf7 is the line suggested by the computer as best for White albeit practically equal.

Bc8 when the Q-side pawns start to disappear.  I think that White can hold the draw by a timely sacrifice of bishop for 2 pawns in this line.

Bd8 31. fxe5 fxe5 allows the bishop out and gives White chances again.  I was a bit worried by 32. Bg5 and 33. Bxd8 although 32. Bd1 is probably better restricting the knight's squares and meeting Ke6/d7 with Bf8 Ba4 and c6 if he can get away with it.

362,19,35,Kd5,b'1b6/1p5p/1P3p1B/2Pk1p2/p3pP2/P3K3/7P/8 w - -',A hint of psychology to this move.  It looks aggressive and White's reply is pretty forced but White is now looking to hold the draw and gets suckered into a repetition.  35. ... Kd7 is stronger because I can triangulate the king to lose a tempo if necessary.  36. Bg7 Ke7 37. Bh6 Kf7 38. h4 Ke6 39. h5 Ke7 40. Bg7 Kf7 and I can waste a move by playing Ke7.

White doesn't realise how short of moves he's going to get and the bishop needs to be on g7 to give flexibility as to when it goes to f8.  Black's not exactly blessed in the moves category at this point - his bishop may have potential energy but that's about it whilst his pawns aren't going anywhere.  A tempo here or there will make all the difference.

552,30,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This advanced is really the only principled move and is by far the most commonly played move.
553,30,3,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is virtually forced.
554,30,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',and this is the standard move for white too
555,30,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black starts to attack the white centre.
556,30,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 is the most commonly played move and according to the database the most successful move out of the commonly played moves. Nc3 here actually scores 100% but it looks bad to allow black to double white's pawns. There is only one game with Nc3 on the database and I wasn't going to trust a single game!
557,30,7,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black pins the white knight on f3 again the most commonly played move in this position.

559,30,9,c6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',e6 is more common here although c6 does score better for black.
560,30,10,c4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',I go with c4 as it scores better than the more popular 0-0
561,30,11,Nb6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1npp4/4P3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Nb6 is the most popular move although Nc7 scores better.

563,30,13,dxe5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4p3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',dxe5 is the more popular move - 60 games on the database with it compared with 59 for Nb8-d7 which does score better. Generally when you have pawns in the centre like this which can take each other it is better to leave the central tension unless you fear your opponent exchanging or can gain an advantage by exchanging.
564,30,14,Nxe5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4N3/2PP2b1/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Nxe5 is more popular and scores better than recapturing with the pawn. Black can grab a pawn here with Bxe2 and the Qxd4 but white has plenty of compensation in better development.
565,30,15,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4Nb2/2PP4/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So my opponent declines the pawn.

569,30,19,1Be4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4N3/2PPb1P1/5N2/PP2BP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',But that game went 10. g4 Bg6 11. h4 Be7 12. Nxg6 hxg6 13. Be3 Nb8d7 14. Qc2 c5 15. O-O-O Qc7 16.

Ng5+ is interesting and of course if black just moves his king again white recaptures the bishop on e4 with advantage. However black has Qxg5 13. Bxg5 Bxh1 with more than enough compensation for the sacrificed queen. 11. Ng5 is worthy of consideration but Bxh1 12. Ngxf7 Qh4 is possible so is Bb4+ 13. Bd2 Qxd4 14. Bxb4 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 Na6 so I decided to block the diagonal of the black dark squared bishop first so there is no bishop check on g4.
571,30,21,1Nb6d7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/2P1N3/3Pb1P1/5N2/PP2BP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This seems a natural retreat but the Gameknot post-match computer analysis says it is a mistake and puts white's advantage at 1.4 pawns. It gives as best  f6 11. cxb6 fxe5 12. bxa7 Rxa7 13. dxe5 Qxd1+ 14. Bxd1 Bb4+ 15. Bd2 Bxd2+ 16. Kxd2 O-O 17. Ke3 Bd5 18. a4 with white's advantage down to 0.64

In many variations white has Qb3 hitting b7 and e6 so black sensibly prevent this. However the computer prefers Nxc5 14. Nxh7 Qh4 15. Nxf8 Qxh8 16. Ng6 Qh7 17. Nf4 Ne4 18. Nxe6 g5 19. Nxg5 Qxh2 20.

So i must say.. Its an verry weird game.. With one good message.. Dont give up to soon. See what white tried to do after he lost the rook.. It ended up in a draw!

864,39,18,b6,b'8/p3k1p1/1pb5/2p5/2Pp1KP1/1N1P4/P1P5/8 w - -',i don't want his horse on this side of the board
865,39,19,Ke6,b'8/p5p1/1pb1k3/2p5/2Pp1KP1/3P4/P1PN4/8 w - -',let us go now
866,39,20,a6,b'8/6p1/ppb2k2/2p5/2Pp1KP1/N2P4/P1P5/8 w - -',still don't want him :-)
867,39,21,axb5,b'8/6p1/2b2k2/1pp5/3p1KP1/3P4/P1P5/1N6 w - -',have to be very careful to avoid the draw or the free a-pawn
868,39,22,g5+,b'8/8/2b2k2/1pp3p1/3p1KP1/3P4/P1PN4/8 w - g6',he has to withdraw.

870,39,24,Ke5,b'8/8/8/1ppbk1p1/3p2P1/P2P2K1/2PN4/8 w - -',but first I approach to protect d4... And here in case of Nf3 i planned to take the horse install the king on d5 and go on with c5. Unstoppable.
871,39,25,4Nd2,b'8/8/8/1p1bk1p1/2pp2P1/P2P2K1/2PN4/8 b - -',this is the defense i did not expect but it didn't change my plan.

873,39,27,Kc5,b'8/8/8/1pk3p1/3p2P1/P1pP4/2P1K3/8 w - -',"i expected the meeting on a3 by 
46 Kd1 Kb6 (not b4 that leads to a draw) 47. Kc1 Ka5 48. Kb1 Ka4 and force him to zugzwang after 49 Ka2 b4 50. axb Kxb4 and I go back to his g-pawn..."
874,39,28,4Kf3,b'8/8/8/1pk3p1/3p2P1/P1pP1K2/2P5/8 b - -',but he eased my mind
