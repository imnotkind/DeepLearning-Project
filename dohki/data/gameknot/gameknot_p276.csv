This move looking to bring the rook into the action via Rxb2 looks attractive but the rook has nowhere to go after b2 apart from c2 and white's queen is about to wreck havoc. What are the options here? Qg6 doesn't work as 28.Bxa6 fxe4 29.Nxe4 is strong for white. However white could slip up here and play 29.Rxe4? Reb8 30.Qc7 Rf8 and black is back in charge. Another slip up would be 29.fxe4 Reb8 30.Qc7 Rxb2 throwing away the initiative. 27. ... fxe4 looks the only option here for black.

37,0,37,Rxe2,b'4r1k1/6b1/3Q3n/P1pPnp1q/4PB2/2N2PPp/4r3/4RRK1 w - -',Desperation. As I said earlier c2 looks the only possible square for the rook. 29. ... fxe4 gives white the chance to throw it away: 30.fxe4 Nhg4 31.Qxc5? (Qa6 is the correct move) Nd3 32.Bxd3 Rg2  33.Kh1 Rh2  34.Kg1 Rg2  and a draw by repetition.
38,0,38,3Kh1,b'4r1k1/6b1/3Q3n/P1pP1p1q/4PB2/2N2nPp/4R3/5R1K b - -',As simple as that really. Black has nothing left to offer. White can exchange pieces and win with ease.

* Moving a pawn will just give white the initiative.
* I won't move or exchange the bishop from a very good outpost.
* The knight is currently safe (Rc2 is toothless) and has a safe haven on d5. It is also very active.
* A check wins me nothing better to keep it for a rainy day.
* I also want to keep my rook at d8 - keeping the knight pin and the tension.
* Exchanging will make the life easier for white especially since he has got the more active king.

So I need to do something with Rf8 which also happens to be my most inactive piece. I want to turn the tables with double rooks on the d-file increasing the pressure:
* Rf7 is not good because of Rd7 Nc5 or Ne5 which will force an exchange on d2 which I don't want to do.
* Rf6 is not good because of Rd6 Nc5 threatening a fork on b7 thus forces an exchange on d2...
* 27 .. Rf5 deprives the white knight of the e5 and c5 squares. Lets see what I think will happen:

27 .. Rf5 28 Ne2 Re8  [29 Kd4 Nxe2  30 Rxe2 Rxe2 31 Rxe2 Rd5  (winning a Knight)] or [29 Kf2 Ne4  (winning the exchange)]

Key moves for black is (in order)
* Re6 driving the white king towards the board edge away from his defenses.
* Nd5 protecting e7 for the rook and closes the in-route for the white d2 rook.
* Re7 Rf8#

Black also have the options:
* Nxg2 a decoy sacrifice when the white knight is on d6 and the king on d7 or e6 then the black rooks can pin and win the knight. 
* Bd5 if white moves a piece to d5 (see below). This keep the white king out of c6 which is an escape route to c5. This leaves b5 hanging and requires the white knight to move a second time.

Key moves for white is
* Try escaping via Kc5. Black must close this hole and white try to open it.
* Moving the king vacates the square d6 which is a stronghold square for white. The knight or rook can move in and defend on d6. It also blocks checks on the 6th rank and opens up a route for the king to c5.
* Kc7 opens up the d-file for the white rook and an annoying check on d8 looms. It also removes a check in the rook  mating pattern allowing a white piece to move freely.
* Nd6 attacks f7 and e8 which are key checkmate squares. It also threatens to exchange the c4 bishop. The c4 bishop is key to check-mate by supporting Re6.
* Nc5 protects e6 puts up (with Ne4) a protective wall against rook checking patterns. Also easily protected by N1d3. However it blocks the king escape.

Sample variations king moves first:
37 Kc6 (Leaving d6 and escapes towards the queenside) Re6  (38 Rd6 Bd5  looses the rook after K7 Rf7 )  38 Nd6 Nxg2 (decoy sacrifice grabs a pawn hangs f3 the knight cannot take f5) 39 Rxg2 Rd5 (attacks the pinned knight) 40 Rgd2 Rexd6  (The d2 rook cannot take and will be lost)

Blacks advantages:
* Black is up a pawn.
* Black has two rooks against a rook and two knights. i.e. three long-range pieces against one long-range and two short-range pieces in an open game.
* Black still has formidable mate-threats e.g. Rf7  Kf8 Re8 .
* Whites knight on c1 is a long way from the action.
* Whites rook is inactive.

Whites advantages:
* White has the same number of pieces and one pawn more than black.
* Black pawn on a7 is hanging.
* Whites king is more active (but still very vulnerable)
* White can still defend with the e8 square with Nc7 (but looses after Rf7  [Kc8 Rf8 looses the knight] Kd8 Rd6  [Ke8 Bc6#]  Rc6 pinning and winning the knight)

Unfortunately white cannot capitalize on his advantages unless black makes a blunder.

Blacks strategy:
* Force whites king to the 8th rank - here I can mate it but it also blocks rook checks against my black king.
* Use the mating threats to steal material.
* Check-mate white possibly with the kings support on Kf8 or bishop on c6.

* Avoid mate (doh!)
* Activate whites pieces
* Trade to relieve the pressure against the king.

177,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a game where I dared to sacrifice a piece. Stay with me (or scroll to the end) to see how it turned out.
178,5,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Nothing special so far
179,5,2,Qd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pQ4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I kind of like this position. I have a checkmate threat and he can't play 7.. Be6 to harass my queen.
180,5,3,Bb5+,b'r1b1kbnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Once again he can't use his light-coloured bishop to get rid of the threat because of 9. Qxb7
181,5,4,Kd8,b'r1bk1bnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',I'm pretty satisfied with the opening. He gave up castling and I can dream of attacking his king with all of my pieces (of course most of them are still undeveloped). Fritz likes this position ( 1.5 evaluation) but at the moment I hadn't any real plan in my head.
182,5,5,Nc3,b'r1bk1bnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Between castling and developing a piece I chose the latter. It also protects my e-pawn.
183,5,6,a6,b'r1bk1bnr/1p2qppp/p2p4/1BpQ4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I think it's a standard tactic to harass the opponent's pieces.

185,5,8,1Be6,b'r2k1bnr/1p2qppp/p2pb3/2pQ4/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Perhaps the best move. Now Qxb7 isn't possible anymore and I have to run to h5
186,5,9,Nf6,b'r2k1b1r/1p2qppp/p2pbn2/2p4Q/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',At this point I wasn't happy with my position because my queen was on the run. Black on the other hand kept developing pieces with tempo.

189,5,12,1Bf4,b'r4b1r/1pk1qpp1/p2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Time to develop the other bishop.

I don't usually sacrifice pieces like that and I wasn't hoping for much but I thought it would certainly spice up the game."
191,5,14,1Bxa6,b'4rb1r/1pk1qpp1/B2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Fritz is not very impressed by my move and I suspect neither is my opponent.

193,5,16,1Qd7,b'4rb1r/2kq1pp1/Q2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',According to Fritz this is quite a mistake its evaluation jumping from  1.1 to  8 (unless my computer is crazy). It seems that the best move would've been 16..Kb8
194,5,17,1Nb5+,b'4rb1r/2kq1pp1/Q2pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',In this case the most obvious move is also the best one. Fritz says that by this point black is toasted.
195,5,18,1Kd8,b'3krb1r/3q1pp1/Q2pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The alternative was 17..Kb8 in which case Black is also lost but it's not obvious to me how (I'm not sure I would've found the right moves after 18. Nxd6). However 17..Kd8 suits me because I realized that Qb6  seals the game.
196,5,19,1Qb6+,b'3krb1r/3q1pp1/1Q1pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',His options are 18..Ke7 leading to checkmate in 2 or 18..Kc8 where he loses the queen. 
197,5,20,1Kc8,b'2k1rb1r/3q1pp1/1Q1pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black chooses to stay in the game for a while.

202,6,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The initial set up of a themed mini tournament. White had better know what he's doing as the KG often leads to quick action and he has a potentially weak kingside.
203,6,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I feel this is the most aggressive way to deal with the KG. Let's see if white is on his toes......
204,6,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',?! 3. Nf3 is probably the better route. By trying to regain the pawn immediately white hinders his LSB while allowing the brutally strong........

208,6,6,Qe1,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/4Pp1q/3P4/PPPK2PP/RNB1QBNR b kq -',White desperately attempts to repel the invaders at a cost of a pawn. White is attempting to ease the pressure by exchanging queens which may just be a good idea in theory in this particular situation even though he is temporarily down in material. Black's c pawn is not totally immune from danger yet. However black is not obliged to accept this offer and responds.......
209,6,7,Bf2,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp1q/3P4/PPPK1bPP/RNB1QBNR w kq -',.....deflecting the white queen back to the light squares which is a nice tempo gain in furtherance of bringing another piece in to the fray.
210,6,8,Qe2,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp1q/3P4/PPPKQbPP/RNB2BNR b kq -',?! The white queen is about to be in a world of hurt. 6. Qd1 was better as 6...d6 7. Be2 starts to get white untangled. Now she is two moves away from being a target.
211,6,9,d6,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp1q/3P4/PPPKQbPP/RNB2BNR w kq -',Threatening Bg4 trapping the white queen.
212,6,10,Nh3,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp1q/3P3N/PPPKQbPP/RNB2B1R b kq -',!? Very creative. White sees 7...Bg4 8. QxB QxQ 9. NxQ.
213,6,11,Bxh3,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp1q/3P3b/PPPKQbPP/RNB2B1R w kq -',I figured out that Bg4 wasn't quite as sexy now and decide to just press forward in my attack. I'm looking to double up his pawns on the a file and get my knights into action. Unusual game.....black hasn't made a knight move yet.......
214,6,12,Qg4,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/4PpQq/3P3P/PPPK1b1P/RNB2B1R b kq -',White still has the idea of trading queens rapidly to simplify his position but black of course......
215,6,13,Be3+,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/4PpQq/3Pb2P/PPPK3P/RNB2B1R w kq -',....wants to keep forcing tough decisions and attempts to drive the king away from defenders.
216,6,14,1Kc3,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/4PpQq/2KPb2P/PPP4P/RNB2B1R b kq -',? Wrong choice. The apparent escape only seals white's fate. 9. Kd1 was the only play and perhaps then some clearance captures for white. By playing 10. Kc3 white has opened himself up to an all-out assault.
217,6,15,1Qf6+,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/8/4PpQ1/2KPb2P/PPP4P/RNB2B1R w kq -',This check simply serves the purpose of driving the black king closer to the edge. Notice how d2 is not available?
218,6,16,1Kb3,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/8/4PpQ1/1K1Pb2P/PPP4P/RNB2B1R b kq -',It may be academic at this point as I don't see any better move for white.

239,8,3,1Nh4,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp3p/np3p2/3Pp2p/1PB1P2N/P1N5/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',At this stage white is about to make several mistakes that are costly in material and end up changing the board to favor black
240,8,4,1f5,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp3p/np6/3Ppp1p/1PB1P2N/P1N5/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',this challenge offers a pawn to the knight or pawn and white chooses
241,8,5,1exf5,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp3p/np6/3PpP1p/1PB4N/P1N5/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',the wrong move. resulting in
242,8,6,1Qxh4,b'r3kb1r/pbpp3p/np6/3PpP1p/1PB4q/P1N5/2P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',this then

244,8,8,Kd8,b'r2k1b1r/pbpp3p/np6/3PpP1Q/1Pq5/P1N3P1/2P2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',then
245,8,9,Qxd5,b'r2k1b1r/pbpp3p/np6/3qpP1Q/1P6/P5P1/N1P2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',this. So from even to plus 5 points because of one mistake. The board looks a lot different now and black will mount an attack from a stronger position. 
246,8,10,c6,b'r2k1b1r/pb1p3p/npp5/3qpP1Q/1P6/P4PP1/N1P4P/R4RK1 w - -',first I have to secure the king
247,8,11,1Nc3,b'r2k1b1r/pb1p3p/npp5/3qpP1Q/1P6/P1N2PP1/2P4P/R4RK1 b - -',Oh and protect my queen

251,8,15,1Kc7,b'r4b1r/pbkp3p/npp5/4pP1Q/1P6/P1q2PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K w - -',so I better improvise a castle

254,8,18,2Qf6,b'3r1b1r/pbkp3p/npp2Q2/4pP2/1P6/P1q2PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K b - -',This next decision is key. I opted to sacrifice my castle to lock the queen in the lower half of the board. I choose to do so because I am planing to bring out my bishop on f-8 to join in the mate
255,8,19,2Qxa3,b'3r1b1r/pbkp3p/npp2Q2/4pP2/1P6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K w - -',soI capture the key pawn and increase my haul...while freeing up my bishop sacrificing a castle and keeping the queen on that side of the board away from my attack
256,8,20,2Qxh8,b'3r1b1Q/pbkp3p/npp5/4pP2/1P6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K b - -',thus
257,8,21,2Bxb4,b'3r3Q/pbkp3p/npp5/4pP2/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K w - -',and thus
258,8,22,2Qxh7,b'3r4/pbkp3Q/npp5/4pP2/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K b - -',the queen runs around aimlessly 
259,8,23,2Nb8,b'1n1r4/pbkp3Q/1pp5/4pP2/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K w - -',now I get my bishop on b-7 involved but first I have to move my knight
260,8,24,2f6,b'1n1r4/pbkp3Q/1pp2P2/4p3/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K b - -',White does not see the danger. so he pushes a pawn 
261,8,25,2Ba6,b'1n1r4/p1kp3Q/bpp2P2/4p3/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3R1R1K w - -',the long reach of the bishop again
262,8,26,2Rd3,b'1n1r4/p1kp3Q/bpp2P2/4p3/1b6/q2R1PP1/2P4P/5R1K b - -',a castle for a bishop - of course I will thank you
263,8,27,2Rd1,b'1n1r4/p1kp3Q/1pp2P2/4p3/1b6/q2b1PP1/2P4P/3R3K b - -',this was a most interesting move. Why not capture the bishop?
264,8,28,2Be2,b'1n1r4/p1kp3Q/1pp2P2/4p3/1b6/q4PP1/2P1b2P/3R3K w - -',this is really a waste of time because the bishop needs to move to c-5 a the queen to f-3 and its over.
265,8,29,2Qg6,b'1n1r4/p1kp1P2/1pp3Q1/4p3/1b6/q4PP1/2P4P/3b3K b - -',this was a funny move by white. I am not sure what the plan was
266,8,30,2Qxf3+,b'1n1r4/p1kp1P2/1pp3Q1/4p3/1b6/5qP1/2P4P/3b3K w - -',but this is the end game
267,8,31,Bc5#,b'1n1r4/p1kp1P2/1pp3Q1/2b1p3/8/5qP1/2P4P/3b2K1 w - -',as noted an elegant mate!
268,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',he opens the way i usually do
269,9,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',so i naturally match
270,9,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',nothing surprising
271,9,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',defend the pawn and get the knight out
272,9,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',the same
273,9,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',we're mirroring each other fine for now
274,9,6,Nd5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2bNp3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',there's a more daring move. no immediate attack but it does trap my queen till i can either get rid of that knight or castle otherwise he'll have a king/rook forked check
275,9,7,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2bNp3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',so i set up a sacrifice
276,9,8,f4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2bNp3/2B1PP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',that complicates matters quite a bit plenty of options here
277,9,9,Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2bNp3/2B1nP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',he probably expected me to either take f4 or trade the knights this move obviously threw him for a bit of a loop and his obvious next move might be to take e5 and trade pawns but that would clearly give me a positional advantage with my two knights controlling the middle and my king still ready to castle
278,9,10,Ne3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1nP2/4N3/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',the alternatives might not have been pretty but i don't get this move at all. i would've guessed d2 to d3 to chase off my knight and delay the pawn exchange
279,9,11,exf4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2B1np2/4N3/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',instead i take his pawn and now he's moved his knight right into its attack path so he's going to have to waste another move defending it
280,9,12,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BPnp2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq d3',now he finally moves that d pawn but this still doesn't make much sense as my bishop is obviously not in real danger here and that d pawn is now doomed - it does force me to delay taking his knight though
281,9,13,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2Bnnp2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',so i take the pawn and i'm back out of danger
282,9,14,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2Bnnp2/4NN2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',not bad he's setting up a lot of options here. if i just take the knight at e3 he takes the one at d4 and he'll have the definite positional advantage. if i instead take the knight at f3 that enables his queen to come into play pretty decisively and make a real mess of things over there. so time for creative thinking
283,9,15,Nd6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/2b5/2Bn1p2/4NN2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',so that's creative thinking and not looking so hot now that i see it - no better than the other options already mentioned. now this is basically just looking like a mess of piece exchanges
284,9,16,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/2b5/2BN1p2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',and it begins
285,9,17,Bxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2Bb1p2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',now this was kind of silly - it would seem to be exchanging my knight and bishop for just his knight. i clearly should have sent the knight at d6 to take the bishop at c4 and then there'd at least be an even exchange. as it is it would seem like i'd only come even out of this because i'd already decimated a bunch of his pawns
286,9,18,1O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2Bb1p2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',but much to my surprise he doesn't take the ridiculous bait and castles instead leaving me some room to redeem myself
287,9,19,1fxe3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2Bb4/4p3/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',i decide i might as well see what i can get here. again a bad move. i should have used the bishop to take the knight putting his king in check and thereby assuring that he'd have to trade his bishop for mine so i'd get a bishop & a knight for just one bishop. a couple of big tactical errors early on here and the middle of the board is almost cleared out already. 
288,9,20,1Qxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2BQ4/4p3/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',so now his queen wakes up and delayed takes the bishop
289,9,21,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2BQ4/4p3/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',time to get my king to relative safety before it's too late but white has a massive position of power at this point and it's starting to look like i'm screwed
290,9,22,1Bxe3,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/2BQ4/4B3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',yup there goes that floating lonely pawn and white's position is looking better and better while almost all my living pieces are trapped back row
291,9,23,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p1n4/8/2BQ4/4B3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',my first step to correct that creating an alley for the bishop to attack through
292,9,24,1Rf3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p1n4/8/2BQ4/4BR2/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',he's clearly moving the rook out for the mate while i'm still mostly trapped. i can't even move my knight anywhere without getting him killed
293,9,25,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p1n4/8/2BQ4/4BR2/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',seemingly innocuous but this is the crucial move as it turns out. protects my rook attacks his rook and sets up future assaults on the white king
294,9,26,1Rg3,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p1n4/8/2BQ4/4B1R1/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',there's the mate attempt of course
295,9,27,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p6/5n2/2BQ4/4B1R1/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',fortunately this move frees up my knight finally attacking simultaneously all 4 points of interest on the enemy side -- the three attackers and the spot they're all gunning for.
296,9,28,1Rxg7+,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1pRp/1p6/5n2/2BQ4/4B3/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',white decides to sacrifice his rook in the interest of clearly up the opening
297,9,29,1Nxg7,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1pnp/1p6/8/2BQ4/4B3/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',and there's nothing i can do but grab him although things are still looking pretty grim for poor old black
298,9,30,1Bh6,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1pnp/1p5B/8/2BQ4/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',and even more so now - move and he's got my rook stay and he's got mate
299,9,31,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1p1p/1p5B/5n2/2BQ4/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',so of course i move basically the only viable option there or it would've all been over
300,9,32,1Qg4+,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1p1p/1p5B/5n2/2B3Q1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',but he's got a great move really devastating
301,9,33,1Kh8,b'r2q1r1k/pbpp1p1p/1p5B/5n2/2B3Q1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',my only option is to tuck up in the corner and hide and i'm feeling really penned in now
302,9,34,1Bxf8,b'r2q1B1k/pbpp1p1p/1p6/5n2/2B3Q1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',he grabs the rook as predicted and there's not much to do but take his bishop and sacrifice the knight. if i move the knight instead he's got mate and this is a very precarious balance
303,9,35,1Qxf8,b'r4q1k/pbpp1p1p/1p6/5n2/2B3Q1/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',so there's my only real option eliminating the mate threat for the moment
304,9,36,1Qxf5,b'r4q1k/pbpp1p1p/1p6/5Q2/2B5/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',but the exchange wasn't too fair and i say goodbye to my knight which served me well. still his attack seems to have faltered at this point - he drove on aggressively boldly sacrificing a lot but things have wound up pretty even. he seems to have given up a massive positional advantage here and we're back to an even fight
305,9,37,1Qg7,b'r6k/pbpp1pqp/1p6/5Q2/2B5/8/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',it looks to him i assume like i'm setting up to attack that b2 pawn and make a play on his second rook but does anybody else remember that little bishop hiding out at b7? i do but obviously he doesn't
306,9,38,2Bd3,b'r6k/pbpp1pqp/1p6/5Q2/8/3B4/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',even if he missed the obvious mate this is puzzling the best he could hope for here is to exchange his queen and bishop for my queen thus turning his former advantage into a disadvantage -- i guess he figured i'd be stupid enough to go off chasing his b2 pawn and the rook in the back and leave him to mate me on the next turn
307,9,39,2Qxg2#,b'r6k/pbpp1p1p/1p6/5Q2/8/3B4/PPP3qP/R5K1 w - -',no such luck though and the bishop tucked in the corner proves its decisive power as i pull out a rough victory from what seemed like certain defeat
308,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',my standard opening
309,10,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',and he matches it
310,10,2,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',set up the opening play for an early check
311,10,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',which he defuses
312,10,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',continuing play
313,10,5,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',his counter

315,10,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',so now the game can begin in earnest
316,10,8,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',defends the bishop at c4 and frees up the c1 bishop as well
317,10,9,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2p1p/3pbnp1/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',he offers a bishop trade
318,10,10,Bxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2p1p/3pBnp1/4p3/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',which i accept
319,10,11,fxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp4p/3ppnp1/4p3/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',and he completes the trade
320,10,12,Bg5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp4p/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',trapping his knight there and setting up a potential queen/rook fork in the next move
321,10,13,Bg7,b'rn1qk2r/ppp3bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',but he wisely defends the knight
322,10,14,Nc3,b'rn1qk2r/ppp3bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',making my knight active and freeing up a castling possibility
323,10,15,Rf8,b'rn1qkr2/ppp3bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQq -',he further shores up the knight and presents the possibility of attacking my queen soon
324,10,16,Qh3,b'rn1qkr2/ppp3bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq -',so i attack the e6 pawn for a possible check
325,10,17,Qe7,b'rn2kr2/ppp1q1bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQq -',and he defends e6
326,10,18,1Nge2,b'rn2kr2/ppp1q1bp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R b KQq -',freeing up another castling route and bringing the other knight into play
327,10,19,1Qf7,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qbp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R w KQq -',getting the powerful queen and rook on one file setting up a future attack on f2
328,10,20,1O-O,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qbp/3ppnp1/4p1B1/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 b q -',but that attack is defused of threat by the castling
329,10,21,1Nh5,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qbp/3pp1p1/4p1Bn/4P3/2NP3Q/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 w q -',he moves the knight out anyway lots of possibilities for a move to f4
330,10,22,1d4,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qbp/3pp1p1/4p1Bn/3PP3/2N4Q/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 b q -',attacking e5 hoping to bring my e2 knight into play if he takes the pawn
331,10,23,1h6,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qb1/3pp1pp/4p1Bn/3PP3/2N4Q/PPP1NPPP/R4RK1 w q -',which he doesn't forcing me to address the attack on my bishop first
332,10,24,1Bd2,b'rn2kr2/ppp2qb1/3pp1pp/4p2n/3PP3/2N4Q/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 b q -',fleeing obviously
333,10,25,1Nc6,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/2npp1pp/4p2n/3PP3/2N4Q/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 w q -',a triple move: he brings his knight into play attacks the weak d4 and frees up the back row for castling
334,10,26,1d5,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/2npp1pp/3Pp2n/4P3/2N4Q/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 b q -',i decide to change plans and fork the knight and pawn
335,10,27,1exd5,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/2np2pp/3pp2n/4P3/2N4Q/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 w q -',he takes the pawn
336,10,28,1exd5,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/2np2pp/3Pp2n/8/2N4Q/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 b q -',and i complete the parry to put the knight back in danger

340,10,32,1Rac1,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/3p2pp/1N1Pp2n/8/7Q/PPnBNPPP/2R2RK1 b q -',and i attack with the bishop
341,10,33,1Nd4,b'r3kr2/ppp2qb1/3p2pp/1N1Pp2n/3n4/7Q/PP1BNPPP/2R2RK1 w q -',smart move sets up a knight trade from either of my knights and a king/rook fork check if i don't take it
342,10,34,1Rxc7,b'r3kr2/ppR2qb1/3p2pp/1N1Pp2n/3n4/7Q/PP1BNPPP/5RK1 b q -',but i decide to ignore his knight's threat for now and force him to address his queen
343,10,35,1Nxe2+,b'r3kr2/ppR2qb1/3p2pp/1N1Pp2n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5RK1 w q -',which he delays by putting me in check and stealing a knight with no possibility of trade - i neglected that possibility stupidly
344,10,36,1Kh1,b'r3kr2/ppR2qb1/3p2pp/1N1Pp2n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b q -',only possibility

346,10,38,2Nxd6+,b'r3kr2/ppR3b1/3N2pp/3Ppq1n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b q -',but he made a big blunder and missed that great opening
347,10,39,2Kd8,b'r2k1r2/ppR3b1/3N2pp/3Ppq1n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he insures that he'll at least get a rook out of this deal
348,10,40,2Nxf5,b'r2k1r2/ppR3b1/6pp/3PpN1n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',but i get his queen

350,10,42,2Nxg7,b'r4r2/ppk3N1/6pp/3Pp2n/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',and i decide to trade my knight for his second bishop
351,10,43,2Nxg7,b'r4r2/ppk3n1/6pp/3Pp3/8/7Q/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he completes the trade
352,10,44,2Qxh6,b'r4r2/ppk3n1/6pQ/3Pp3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',and i grab a pawn and attack the knight knowing i'll probably at least get another pawn out of this
353,10,45,2Nf5,b'r4r2/ppk5/6pQ/3Ppn2/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he flees and attacks simultaneously
354,10,46,2Qxg6,b'r4r2/ppk5/6Q1/3Ppn2/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',and i grab the other pawn
355,10,47,2Ne7,b'r4r2/ppk1n3/6Q1/3Pp3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he attacks again
356,10,48,2d6+,b'r4r2/ppk1n3/3P2Q1/4p3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',but he missed another crucial opening and his knight is doomed
357,10,49,2Kd7,b'r4r2/pp1kn3/3P2Q1/4p3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he makes sure he'll at least grab my pawn and eliminate the promotion risk
358,10,50,2dxe7,b'r4r2/pp1kP3/6Q1/4p3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K b - -',but i grab his knight and take the threat off my queen
359,10,51,2Kxe7,b'r4r2/pp2k3/6Q1/4p3/8/8/PP1BnPPP/5R1K w - -',he finishes off the pawn
360,10,52,2Bb4+,b'r4r2/pp2k3/6Q1/4p3/1B6/8/PP2nPPP/5R1K b - -',and a check that should net me a bishop for rook trade if i want it
361,10,53,2Kd7,b'r4r2/pp1k4/6Q1/4p3/1B6/8/PP2nPPP/5R1K w - -',he dodges
362,10,54,2Rd1+,b'r4r2/pp1k4/6Q1/4p3/1B6/8/PP2nPPP/3R3K b - -',and i check again
363,10,55,2Nd4,b'r4r2/pp1k4/6Q1/4p3/1B1n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K w - -',he blocks the check
364,10,56,2Qd6+,b'r4r2/pp1k4/3Q4/4p3/1B1n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K b - -',and i get another one
365,10,57,2Kc8,b'r1k2r2/pp6/3Q4/4p3/1B1n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K w - -',he dodges
366,10,58,3Qd7+,b'r1k2r2/pp1Q4/8/4p3/1B1n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K b - -',and i make my huge blunder because my conditional moves got messed up -- i planned to take f8 then grab a8 when he fled from check and the game would have been all but over here
367,10,59,3Kxd7,b'r4r2/pp1k4/8/4p3/1B1n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K w - -',but instead he grabs my foolishly offered queen
368,10,60,3Bxf8,b'r4B2/pp1k4/8/4p3/3n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K b - -',and i follow through on the long hovering bishop for rook trade
369,10,61,3Rxf8,b'5r2/pp1k4/8/4p3/3n4/8/PP3PPP/3R3K w - -',he completes the trade
370,10,62,3f3,b'5r2/pp1k4/8/4p3/3n4/5P2/PP4PP/3R3K b - -',and i remove his threat to f2
371,10,63,3Kd6,b'5r2/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n4/5P2/PP4PP/3R3K w - -',he fortifies the weak pawn at e5
372,10,64,3Rd3,b'5r2/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n4/3R1P2/PP4PP/7K b - -',and i'm setting up several avenues for attack and movement
373,10,65,3Rc8,b'2r5/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n4/3R1P2/PP4PP/7K w - -',he threatens an easy checkmate
374,10,66,3g4,b'2r5/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1P2/PP5P/7K b - g3',and i eliminate that possibility
375,10,67,3Rc1+,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1P2/PP5P/2r4K w - -',he checks me anyway to get me up to the second row
376,10,68,3Kg2,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1P2/PP4KP/2r5 b - -',and i'm forced to run
377,10,69,3Rc2+,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1P2/PPr3KP/8 w - -',so that he can put me in check again and start going after the second row pawns
378,10,70,3Kg3,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1PK1/PPr4P/8 b - -',i run
379,10,71,3Rxb2,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n2P1/3R1PK1/Pr5P/8 w - -',and he takes pawn number 1
380,10,72,3f4,b'8/pp6/3k4/4p3/3n1PP1/3R2K1/Pr5P/8 b - -',time to free up the middle of the board b/c i'm planning an end run for promotion to redeem this disaster
381,10,73,3exf4+,b'8/pp6/3k4/8/3n1pP1/3R2K1/Pr5P/8 w - -',he takes the offer
382,10,74,3Kxf4,b'8/pp6/3k4/8/3n1KP1/3R4/Pr5P/8 b - -',and i take his pawn back
383,10,75,3Kc5,b'8/pp6/8/2k5/3n1KP1/3R4/Pr5P/8 w - -',he protects that now weak knight
384,10,76,3h4,b'8/pp6/8/2k5/3n1KPP/3R4/Pr6/8 b - h3',and i start edging those pawns up
385,10,77,3Ne2+,b'8/pp6/8/2k5/5KPP/3R4/Pr2n3/8 w - -',a check
386,10,78,4Kf5,b'8/pp6/8/2k2K2/6PP/3R4/Pr2n3/8 b - -',but it doesn't matter much
387,10,79,4Rxa2,b'8/pp6/8/2k2K2/6PP/3R4/r3n3/8 w - -',he takes that other unprotected pawn
388,10,80,4h5,b'8/pp6/8/2k2K1P/6P1/3R4/r3n3/8 b - -',and i continue the drive for the end game
389,10,81,4Ra6,b'8/pp6/r7/2k2K1P/6P1/3R4/4n3/8 w - -',logically he doesn't want to make it too easy
390,10,82,4g5,b'8/pp6/r7/2k2KPP/8/3R4/4n3/8 b - -',and i shore up the eventual move to h6
391,10,83,4Kc4,b'8/pp6/r7/5KPP/2k5/3R4/4n3/8 w - -',so he attacks the rook
392,10,84,4Rd7,b'8/pp1R4/r7/5KPP/2k5/8/4n3/8 b - -',and i move him out of the way while keeping his king locked off from my advancing pawns and potentially attacking b7
393,10,85,4Ng3+,b'8/pp1R4/r7/5KPP/2k5/6n1/8/8 w - -',he's got check and a fork on h5
394,10,86,4Kg4,b'8/pp1R4/r7/6PP/2k3K1/6n1/8/8 b - -',so i protect the pawn
395,10,87,4Ne4,b'8/pp1R4/r7/6PP/2k1n1K1/8/8/8 w - -',and now he attacks g5
396,10,88,4h6,b'8/pp1R4/r6P/6P1/2k1n1K1/8/8/8 b - -',so i move the now protected pawn up to row 6
397,10,89,4Nf2+,b'8/pp1R4/r6P/6P1/2k3K1/8/5n2/8 w - -',and he goes for check again jockeying around in hopes i'll make a mistake
398,10,90,4Kf5,b'8/pp1R4/r6P/5KP1/2k5/8/5n2/8 b - -',moving back up
399,10,91,4Ra5+,b'8/pp1R4/7P/r4KP1/2k5/8/5n2/8 w - -',and check again
400,10,92,4Kg6,b'8/pp1R4/6KP/r5P1/2k5/8/5n2/8 b - -',but that just allows me to move up with my pawns
401,10,93,4Ra6+,b'8/pp1R4/r5KP/6P1/2k5/8/5n2/8 w - -',so check again
402,10,94,4Kf7,b'8/pp1R1K2/r6P/6P1/2k5/8/5n2/8 b - -',and i move further up anticipating having to protect the pawns some more
403,10,95,4Ng4,b'8/pp1R1K2/r6P/6P1/2k3n1/8/8/8 w - -',he's now prepared to sacrifice a knight to get both those pawns
404,10,96,4h7,b'8/pp1R1K1P/r7/6P1/2k3n1/8/8/8 b - -',but i won't oblige leaving me a move away from taking back control
405,10,97,4Ne5+,b'8/pp1R1K1P/r7/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',he forks my king and rook
406,10,98,5Ke7,b'8/pp1RK2P/r7/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',but even if he takes the rook he doesn't have much chance
407,10,99,5Ng6+,b'8/pp1RK2P/r5n1/6P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',check again and he attacks h8 to prevent promotion
408,10,100,5Kf7,b'8/pp1R1K1P/r5n1/6P1/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',and i give him back the same fork while attacking his knight
409,10,101,5Ne5+,b'8/pp1R1K1P/r7/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',he takes the fork again
410,10,102,5Ke8,b'4K3/pp1R3P/r7/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',and i give him a different move so we can't keep this game up
411,10,103,5Re6+,b'4K3/pp1R3P/4r3/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',attacks with the rook
412,10,104,5Re7,b'4K3/pp2R2P/4r3/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',and i offer a trade that would still leave me with an impending promotion
413,10,105,5Rc6,b'4K3/pp2R2P/2r5/4n1P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',he declines and sets up a rook to c8 mate
414,10,106,5Rxe5,b'4K3/pp5P/2r5/4R1P1/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',but he apparently forgot about the unprotected knight
415,10,107,5Rc7,b'4K3/ppr4P/8/4R1P1/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',attacks the pawn knowing that if i simply promote it he can put me in check and eliminate the queen right away
416,10,108,5g6,b'4K3/ppr4P/6P1/4R3/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',so i just protect the pawn for now
417,10,109,5b5,b'4K3/p1r4P/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 w - b6',he starts his own promotion drive
418,10,110,5Kd8,b'3K4/p1r4P/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',but i won't let him keep me locked up
419,10,111,5Rb7,b'3K4/pr5P/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',he keeps the possibility alive
420,10,112,5Kc8,b'2K5/pr5P/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',and i attack again. no chance now he's done
421,10,113,5Rg7,b'2K5/p5rP/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',i guess he plans to at least get rid of one pawn
422,10,114,5h8=Q,b'2K4Q/p5r1/6P1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',but that's fine i have a queen now
423,10,115,5Rxg6,b'2K4Q/p7/6r1/1p2R3/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',he takes the pawn as planned
424,10,116,5Qh4+,b'2K5/p7/6r1/1p2R3/2k4Q/8/8/8 b - -',and i get check
425,10,117,5Kd3,b'2K5/p7/6r1/1p2R3/7Q/3k4/8/8 w - -',he flees
426,10,118,6Qe4+,b'2K5/p7/6r1/1p2R3/4Q3/3k4/8/8 b - -',"and there you go forked check where he'd lose his last rook and he resigns.

He may very well be right but I have played it so many times it feels like an old flannel shirt or your favorite shotgun;comfortable and warm.....It's won me a fair amount of games too and in my opinion seems to favor white more than e4.

Seems like I have a chance if I don't make a blunder but all of my previous games with yodean have gone _his_ way so I know I have to play perfectly to have a chance.

Worst case is a pawn attack on the bishop and having to skulk back to g3. Really not a bad spot for a bishop anyhow.

However the exchange of queens makes my connected queen side pawns very dangerous. Better in my opinion is Qc8. However given the fact that Mercutio sees that he is almost 400 points stronger than me he takes his chances in the end game. But one of the strongest parts of my game is the endgame. Also in my favor is that I have a clear plan for victory.

The exchange variation is an interesting one because it gives black doubled pawns but also gives him the bishop pair.  What this means to me is that I need to develop quickly and make the most of my pieces on an open board -- if white can close the game or get to an endgame my doubled pawns will put me at a disadvantage (as I learned in a couple of my losses to alabamaboy)

I don't see anything particularly good here for black even in hindsight.    Perhaps Bd7 would be better keeping the bishop on and leaving white's knight awkwardly placed.

Didn't see this pawn sacrifice coming; this gets white's queen into the game and makes me curse myself for not playing 0-0-0 earlier.

889,25,5,Nc3,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PPq3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/n1BQ1K1R b kq -',I might as well play on at least for a couple of moves - If I can develop harassing the queen and pick the cornered knight I just may achieve an almost playable position - an exchange down for some tempi or something.
890,25,6,Qe1,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PPq1BPPP/n1B1QK1R b kq -',Obviously not Qxc2 Nxc2. And keeping the queens on board is essential if I want to succeed in muddying the waters.
891,25,7,1Nd5,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/2PP2b1/5N2/PPq1BPPP/n1B1QK1R b kq -',This knight is heading for b4 - re-gaining the control of the c2-square with tempo since black has to take care of the threath of Nxc7 . I'm not interested in pawn formations any more since I figured out that piece activity is the best hope I have here.
892,25,8,1Bxf3,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/2PP4/5b2/PPq1BPPP/n1B1QK1R w kq -',This maybe isn't too bad but I think it would've been better to continue development. Doubled f-pawns is least of Whites worries here
893,25,9,1gxf3,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/2PP4/5P2/PPq1BP1P/n1B1QK1R b kq -',Bxf3 Qxc4 defends the c7-pawn.
894,25,10,1Bd3,b'2r1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5q2/1NPP4/3B1P2/PP3P1P/n1B1QK1R b k -',To clear the second rank for king and simultaneously improving a piece - A check on h3 is no problem as White wants to activate his queen and capture the a1 knight with his rook.
895,25,11,a5,b'2r1kbnr/1pp1pppp/8/p7/1NPP4/3B1P1q/PP2KP1P/n1B1Q2R w k a6',This seems to be somewhat slow as the knight is not needed here any more - the d3-bishop controls c2. But it is no big mistake since black can now play e6-with tempo.
896,25,12,1Nf4,b'2r1kbnr/1pp2ppp/4p3/p7/2PP1N2/3B1P1q/PP2KP1P/n1B1Q2R b k -',Once again - attacking the queen!
897,25,13,1Be3,b'2r1kbnr/1pp2ppp/4p3/p7/2PP1N1q/3BBP2/PP2KP1P/n3Q2R b k -',White completes his minor piece development. 
898,25,14,1Qd2,b'2r1k1nr/1pp2ppp/3bp3/p7/2PP1N1q/3BBP2/PP1QKP1P/n6R b k -',Now incidentally White is fully coordinated and can start thinking of the d5-thrust and some attacking - he has a huge lead in development. It seems certain that black should've played Nf6 when he had the time. Maybe at next move would still make the job but here black decides to open the c-file for his rook. This turns out to be not so clever choice.
899,25,15,1d5,b'2r1k1nr/1p3ppp/2pbp3/p2P4/2P2N1q/3BBP2/PP1QKP1P/n6R b k -',!?
900,25,16,Nc2,b'2r1k1nr/1p3ppp/3bp3/p2P4/5N1q/3BBP2/PPnQKP1P/7R w k -',A somewhat weird move probably planned to prevent a bishop invasion at b5. a4 is inferior square as it pins the f4-knight.
901,25,17,2Rc1,b'2r1k1nr/1p3ppp/3b4/p2p4/5N1q/4BP2/PPBQKP1P/2R5 b k -',threatening Ba4 
902,25,18,2Bxf4,b'2r1k1nr/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/5b1q/4BP2/PPBQKP1P/2R5 w k -',? I think this only strenghtens the threat of Ba4  since the white queen can now give a check at d5 in case of king coming to the d-file.
903,25,19,2Ba4+,b'2r1k1nr/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/B4b1q/4BP2/PP1QKP1P/2R5 b k -',This is quite a strong in-between move winning back the exchange.
904,25,20,2Rc6,b'4k1nr/1p3ppp/2r5/p2p4/B4b1q/4BP2/PP1QKP1P/2R5 w k -',forced
905,25,21,2Bxf4,b'4k1nr/1p3ppp/2r5/p2p4/B4B1q/5P2/PP1QKP1P/2R5 b k -',simply regaining material the rook is not going to escape.
906,25,22,2Qf6,b'4k1nr/1p3ppp/2r2q2/p2p4/B4B2/5P2/PP1QKP1P/2R5 w k -',Yet another weird move. Centralizing the queen is generally a good idea - but why not to develop the knight?
907,25,23,2Qxd5,b'4k1nr/1p3ppp/2r2q2/p2Q4/B4B2/5P2/PP2KP1P/2R5 b k -',!? This sacrifice should lead to draw as I don't think White is justified for playing for a win. 25.Bxc6 bxc6  just seemed to leave me a pawn down with the black queen dominating the whole board - White would have to take care of the f4-bishop weak b2 pawn etc. etc. and in the endgame whites pawn formation would be inferior. The idea is to check the black king into g5 play Qc5  and after ...f5 Rc4 forcing queen in the corner with ...Qxh2 (h5  would be lethal) play Rg4  and give perpetual with queen. So let's see how all this went in practise...
908,25,24,2Qxf4,b'4k1nr/1p3ppp/2r5/p2Q4/B4q2/5P2/PP2KP1P/2R5 w k -',Otherwise White would have just gained a pawn and Qxb2  Rc2 is not a problem.
909,25,25,2Qb7+,b'6nr/1Q2kppp/8/p7/5q2/5P2/PP2KP1P/2R5 b - -',It is very important to gain the right position of queen and rook to check all the way up the board and get the option to play Rc4
910,25,26,f5,b'6nr/6pp/2R5/pQ3pk1/5q2/5P2/PP2KP1P/8 w - f6',31...Qf5?? 32.Rc5
911,25,27,Qxh2,b'6nr/6pp/8/pQ3pk1/2R5/5P2/PP2KP1q/8 w - -',Centralising the queen (Qd6) would've allowed h5  followed by Qxf5  or a deadly pin (Rc6)
912,25,28,3Qc6+,b'6nr/6pp/2Q2k2/p4p2/6R1/5P2/PP2KP1q/8 b - -',And here I offered a draw. My opponent didn't accept it and thought that he could defend against Rxg7 . I had hardly looked at those variations but it seemed to me that It would be very unwise to allow such an activity.

914,25,30,3Qc3,b'5knr/6Rp/8/p4p2/8/2Q2P2/PP2KP1q/8 b - -',This might still be drawn but If somebody discovers that black was justified in declining the draw offer - please leave a comment!
915,25,31,3Qh6,b'5knr/6Rp/7q/p4p2/8/2Q2P2/PP2KP2/8 w - -',The best.

917,25,33,3Qf6,b'5knr/2R4p/5q2/p4p2/8/2Q2P2/PP2KP2/8 w - -',Here I thought Qe6  but this is equally good if not better. 
918,25,34,Ne7,b'5k1r/2R1n2p/8/Q4p2/8/5P2/Pq3P2/5K2 w - -',Finally black develops his knight after sitting silently for forty moves.

It is not so easy to defend against these threats. White has additional quicker threat of Re6  winning in which black has to take care of - hence his next move
925,25,41,h6,b'3r4/4R3/q5kp/5p2/7Q/5P2/P4PK1/8 w - -',? This is premature as it could be played after g5 too. Now White has a winning manoeuvre.

1061,29,46,2Qb3,b'1n3qk1/2N4p/1pbp1pp1/8/2P1p3/1Q6/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 b - -',so i provide some reinforcements for that exchange
1062,29,47,2Nd7,b'5qk1/2Nn3p/1pbp1pp1/8/2P1p3/1Q6/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 w - -',and so does he assuming he can move to e5 on the next turn
1063,29,48,2c5+,b'5qk1/2Nn3p/1pbp1pp1/2P5/4p3/1Q6/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 b - -',but things get a little disrupted here - he's in check and his pawn structure is threatened some more
1064,29,49,2Qf7,b'6k1/2Nn1q1p/1pbp1pp1/2P5/4p3/1Q6/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 w - -',he realizes the threat and opts for a queen exchange so he can keep his edge
1065,29,50,2Qxf7+,b'6k1/2Nn1Q1p/1pbp1pp1/2P5/4p3/8/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 b - -',the only possible wise decision is to accept and i do
1066,29,51,2Kxf7,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbp1pp1/2P5/4p3/8/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 w - -',so he completes the exchange
1067,29,52,2cxd6,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbP1pp1/8/4p3/8/3r1PPP/1B3RK1 b - -',now i've got a pawn exchange situation and i opt for the d file since that gets his rook back out of my bottom rows for now
1068,29,53,2Rxd6,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbr1pp1/8/4p3/8/5PPP/1B3RK1 w - -',and his rook completes the exchange
1069,29,54,2Re1,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbr1pp1/8/4p3/8/5PPP/1B2R1K1 b - -',i shore up the e file which could let me gain both a bishop and a pawn from an exchange
1070,29,55,2f5,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbr2p1/5p2/4p3/8/5PPP/1B2R1K1 w - -',but he adds backup too
1071,29,56,2Ba2+,b'8/2Nn1k1p/1pbr2p1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',so i abandon the pawn and attack his king hoping i can get at that back row somehow and use that abandoned knight to keep things moving
1072,29,57,2Kf6,b'8/2Nn3p/1pbr1kp1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',happily he obliges with a perfect fork for my knight - it's been sitting back there so long he's probably neglecting it in his calculations
1073,29,58,3Ne8+,b'4N3/3n3p/1pbr1kp1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',but i haven't forgotten and now he's out a rook
1074,29,59,3Ke7,b'4N3/3nk2p/1pbr2p1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',he moves to make sure he'll at least take my knight in return
1075,29,60,3Nxd6,b'8/3nk2p/1pbN2p1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',and i follow through
1076,29,61,3Kxd6,b'8/3n3p/1pbk2p1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',and so does he - now from a position of relative strength he's blown his advantage and evened things up in terms of material - he's also left his back rows completely open to my bishop which can dart in and try to disrupt the pawn structure a bit
1077,29,62,3Rd1+,b'8/3n3p/1pbk2p1/5p2/4p3/8/B4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',but first a check to keep his king moving and get my rook out into the open
1078,29,63,3Ke5,b'8/3n3p/1pb3p1/4kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',he doges away
1079,29,64,3Rc1,b'8/3n3p/1pb3p1/4kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/2R3K1 b - -',and i challenge the bishop to get him moving
1080,29,65,3Nc5,b'8/7p/1pb3p1/2n1kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/2R3K1 w - -',a nice move to block me for now
1081,29,66,3Rd1,b'8/7p/1pb3p1/2n1kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',so i get back on the open file
1082,29,67,3b5,b'8/7p/2b3p1/1pn1kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',and he sets in motion a play for promotion
1083,29,68,3Rd8,b'3R4/7p/2b3p1/1pn1kp2/4p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 b - -',now finally into the back rows to start dismantling things
1084,29,69,3b4,b'3R4/7p/2b3p1/2n1kp2/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 w - -',he advances again threatening my bishop
1085,29,70,3Rh8,b'7R/7p/2b3p1/2n1kp2/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 b - -',so i challenge the base of his pawn structure
1086,29,71,3h5,b'7R/8/2b3p1/2n1kp1p/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 w - h6',and he responds with an advance
1087,29,72,3Rg8,b'6R1/8/2b3p1/2n1kp1p/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 b - -',another challenge to the new base
1088,29,73,3Kf6,b'6R1/8/2b2kp1/2n2p1p/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 w - -',and he fortifies it
1089,29,74,3Rc8,b'2R5/8/2b2kp1/2n2p1p/1p2p3/8/B4PPP/6K1 b - -',attacking his bishop and stacking up so he has to lose at least one piece but it's something of an empty threat for the moment considering his likely next move 
1090,29,75,3b3,b'2R5/8/2b2kp1/2n2p1p/4p3/1p6/B4PPP/6K1 w - -',which is of course to attack my bishop and threaten promotion
1091,29,76,3Bb1,b'2R5/8/2b2kp1/2n2p1p/4p3/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 b - -',so this move gets me out of harm's way and staves off any credible promotion threats for a bit - meanwhile he's now going to lose either a bishop or a knight and he knows it so my threat carries some force after all
1092,29,77,3Bd5,b'2R5/8/5kp1/2nb1p1p/4p3/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 w - -',he decides he'd rather lose the knight apparently
1093,29,78,4Rxc5,b'8/8/5kp1/2Rb1p1p/4p3/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 b - -',so i oblige him and give myself the decisive edge
1094,29,79,4Ke5,b'8/8/6p1/2Rbkp1p/4p3/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 w - -',now the king's going to try and come in and scare me off
1095,29,80,4Rc8,b'2R5/8/6p1/3bkp1p/4p3/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 b - -',so i head back for the back row
1096,29,81,4Kf4,b'2R5/8/6p1/3b1p1p/4pk2/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 w - -',he's apparently dodging my prospective check but it's not a great move otherwise
1097,29,82,4Rd8,b'3R4/8/6p1/3b1p1p/4pk2/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 b - -',especially since his bishop can now be easily threatened again
1098,29,83,4Bc4,b'3R4/8/6p1/5p1p/2b1pk2/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 w - -',forcing him to move out of the danger
1099,29,84,4Rd4,b'8/8/6p1/5p1p/2bRpk2/1p6/5PPP/1B4K1 b - -',but it's a short-lived relief and i continue to chase him
1100,29,85,4Be2,b'8/8/6p1/5p1p/3Rpk2/1p6/4bPPP/1B4K1 w - -',another flight
1101,29,86,4f3,b'8/8/6p1/5p1p/3Rpk2/1p3P2/4b1PP/1B4K1 b - -',and now he'd have to doom his bishop to get that pawn
1102,29,87,4Ke3,b'8/8/6p1/5p1p/3Rp3/1p2kP2/4b1PP/1B4K1 w - -',instead he threatens my rook and frees up the pawn to attack
1103,29,88,4Rd6,b'8/8/3R2p1/5p1p/4p3/1p2kP2/4b1PP/1B4K1 b - -',so i head for the back of the pawn structure again
1104,29,89,4exf3,b'8/8/3R2p1/5p1p/8/1p2kp2/4b1PP/1B4K1 w - -',and he grabs my offered pawn things are looking up for him again with my king increasingly hemmed in by his assault
1105,29,90,4gxf3,b'8/8/3R2p1/5p1p/8/1p2kP2/4b2P/1B4K1 b - -',grab his pawn before it can do real damage
1106,29,91,4Bxf3,b'8/8/3R2p1/5p1p/8/1p2kb2/7P/1B4K1 w - -',and he grabs mine
1107,29,92,4Rxg6,b'8/8/6R1/5p1p/8/1p2kb2/7P/1B4K1 b - -',finally i get to grab that linchpin pawn leaving him with just 3 free-floating pawns and me with one tucked over in the corner but for now untouchable
1108,29,93,4Be4,b'8/8/6R1/5p1p/4b3/1p2k3/7P/1B4K1 w - -',he protects the f5 pawn which is his one good chance to advance to promotion at the moment
1109,29,94,4Bxe4,b'8/8/6R1/5p1p/4B3/1p2k3/7P/6K1 b - -',so i take the offered exchange
1110,29,95,4Kxe4,b'8/8/6R1/5p1p/4k3/1p6/7P/6K1 w - -',and he grabs my bishop - now my very slim advantage is one rook balanced against some very well-positioned pawns and an active king
1111,29,96,4Rb6,b'8/8/1R6/5p1p/4k3/1p6/7P/6K1 b - -',so i decide to eliminate the most decisive threat with no hope of him escaping
1112,29,97,4f4,b'8/8/1R6/7p/4kp2/1p6/7P/6K1 w - -',he gives up the b pawn and advances along f
1113,29,98,5Rxb3,b'8/8/8/7p/4kp2/1R6/7P/6K1 b - -',grabbing the b pawn i also seal off his king from moving down any further so his f pawn will also have to be abandoned sooner or later too. this is the crucial maneuver he's missed
1114,29,99,5f3,b'8/8/8/7p/4k3/1R3p2/7P/6K1 w - -',the pawn advances
1115,29,100,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/7p/4k3/1R3p2/5K1P/8 b - -',but my king cuts it off and there's nothing else he can do. i've got his last viable pawn and after this i'd easily be able to seal him off take the last pawn and advance my last pawn for an easy rook/queen combo mate. he can do little but resign
1116,30,0,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I don't like playing against the Stonewall type formations. Or is it Colle? Anyway I like piece manouvers but this particular pawn structure is ... well ... just boring. I quickly played 5...b6 only to realise that the planned exchange of white square bishops was not possible. Let's say 6. Nf3 Ba6 7. B:a6 N:a6 8. Qa4  and I lose the piece... Well too late.
1117,30,1,Nd2,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/1p2pn2/3pN3/3P1P2/2PB4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I think white could have explored the pin along the a4-e8 diagonal rather than play routinely. But it makes sense - my bishop is blocked on b7 and although it will... Ok let's keep the plot unknown. For now my issues are: 1) castling - which will undoubtedly result in all-out white attack on the kingside; 2) finding something useful to do for my bishop on b7. 
1118,30,2,Qe7,b'r3k2r/pb1nqppp/1p1bpn2/3pN3/3P1P2/2PB1Q2/PP1N2PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I don't know. I could already see contours of the attack - g2-g4 Qg3 Nd2-f3 g4-g5 h2-h4. I figured bringing the queen closer to the kingside would help survive the attack!

White helps me cement the lines and gives me sufficient time to organise some sort of defence. I thinking keeping tension with h2-h4 intending h4-h5 with Kh1 and positioning rooks along g and f files or even both on g files would be a more promising plan. 
1124,30,8,Raf8,b'5r1r/1b1nqpkp/pp1bp1p1/3pN1Pn/3P1PQ1/2PB4/PP1N3P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Ok first concern is partially addressed. Defence looks sound. Time to start thinking about the poor bishop on b7.

Panic!!! What shall I do? Hmmm. Keep cool. All I want is not to take on h5 with the pawn right? Yes. So imagine my h7 pawn did not exist. Then I could take it with the rook. So comes the idea!

I had totally missed this move in my calculations earlier when planning to double rooks along the h-file because I had two pawns and a knight blocking the bishop on the c1-h6 diagonal! Classic case of chess vision problems.

Here I actually considered Nxg5 but realized that while sort of sacrifice might work in blitz chess (and is very fun) it is not the wisest as the attack would probably not be strong enough...
1206,34,4,1Bg3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2p2/p1n1pn1p/3p2p1/1bPP4/P1N1PNB1/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Black's pawn structure is still screwed up without needing to sacrifice anything. It's not just pawn structure but which pawns. The king's perilous position will eventually be exposed. I was quite confident at this point.
1207,34,5,1c5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2p2/p1nbpn1p/2Pp2p1/3P4/P1N1PNB1/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Trying to lock up the queen's side so I could enjoy attacking the weakened black king...and also hoping for black's next move. Trading black bishops really helps because my white bishop has so much more power at the time since my pawns are on black and his on white.
1208,34,6,1hxg3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2p2/p1n1pn1p/2Pp2p1/3P4/P1N1PNP1/1PQ2PP1/R3KB1R b KQ -',Now my rook can apply pressure without having to move.

1211,34,9,1g4,b'r1bq1r2/1pp2pk1/p1n1pn1p/2Pp4/3P2p1/P1N1PNP1/1PQ1BPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',He beat me to it! This was becoming very inconvenient!

I'm liking this more again. Just wish I hadn't had to move the Nf3 away. Plus his knights have all the important light squares covered. Maybe this isn't so good after all.
1215,34,13,1Ned7,b'r1bq1r2/1ppn1pk1/p4n1p/2Pp4/8/P1N1PPP1/1PQNB3/R3K2R w KQ -',Really not sure what was best for black here but I don't think this was it. Blocking the bishop in leads to problems. Perhaps Qe7 or Re8 would have been better.
1216,34,14,1b4,b'r1bq1r2/1ppn1pk1/p4n1p/2Pp4/1P6/P1N1PPP1/2QNB3/R3K2R b KQ b3',The only good way to protect the pawn. Using the knight is awkward and the queen is going to have more important things to do. Most of these moves are not complex nor do they have many tactical surprises (well not yet anyway). They are simply sound positional moves that keep building a stronger position. When you have a good positional stand tactics somehow seem to pop up.
1217,34,15,1a5,b'r1bq1r2/1ppn1pk1/5n1p/p1Pp4/1P6/P1N1PPP1/2QNB3/R3K2R w KQ -',hmm... this I was not expecting and got me thinking a while. Thankfully I had a couple days.

1220,34,18,2Nb5,b'r1b2r2/1ppnqpk1/5n1p/pNPp4/1P6/P3PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R b - -',I wasn't sure about this when I played it. I simply couldn't think of anything better. After I played it I realized it was pretty good and there wasn't a lot black could do. I was expecting c6 with the reply of Nd6 making use of an excellent outpost from whence the Knight could wreak havoc. Once again I missed black's reply. He was making what I thought was a winning position into a real battle.
1221,34,19,2Nxc7,b'r1b2r2/1pNnqpk1/5n1p/2Pp4/1p6/P3PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R b - -',21. axb4 Rxa1 22. Rxa1 is not really what I wanted. I still wanted to attack that black king on the h-file. Plus the afore mentioned move could lead to nasty tactics involving black queen and knights. Those pieces work very well together.
1222,34,20,2Rxa3,b'2b2r2/1pNnqpk1/5n1p/2Pp4/1p6/r3PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R w - -',Again I somehow overlooked this and was really beginning to sweat. How was I letting this game get away? A passed pawn 2 squares from promotion? Well better than any alternative I guess...
1223,34,21,bxa3,b'2b2r2/1pNnqpk1/5n1p/2Pp4/8/p3PPP1/2QNBK2/7R w - -',Would love to find a way to gobble up the black pawn but realize the importance of my own c-pawn. Thus the only good way to protect it. I could use the rook but 1) I like it on the h-file (still want to attack that king) and 2) it probably will have to go to the a file anyway to block the pawn and eventually help capture it. So...
1224,34,22,b6,b'2b2r2/2Nnqpk1/1p3n1p/2Pp4/8/pN2PPP1/2Q1BK2/7R w - -',As frustrated as I was getting with black thwarting my plans and turning this into a queen-side game rather than allowing me to use my advantage on the king-side I now realize he was pretty frustrated too in that he didn't have many productive things to do. Such is life when something like a bishop is pinned in and a rook is inactive. It limits the effectiveness of all other pieces.
1225,34,23,2cxb6,b'2b2r2/2Nnqpk1/1P3n1p/3p4/8/pN2PPP1/2Q1BK2/7R b - -',Now I was beginning to see some daylight and good tactical chances. Still I didn't like the realization that the black queen was now connected to his advanced passed pawn and the knights were not too far away. I would have to be careful...
1226,34,24,2Qc6,b'2b2r2/2N1qpk1/1nQ2n1p/3p4/8/pN2PPP1/4BK2/7R b - -',It took me a while to find this move but once I did I was pretty sure I was going to win. I expected ...Qb4 as a response which looks very good and had me worried. But in response I had found a winner which made this game seem really cool to me - a rook sacrifice. It somehow seems so much cooler to sacrifice a rook than just a pawn or minor piece. Anyway here's the line I saw: 25. ... Qb4 26. Rxh6! Kxh6 27. Qxf6 ... and black has his choice of where he wants to be mated. A combination of white pawns and the white bishop leads to a quick mate in either case unless black decides to sacrifice his queen for a pawn. So I was pretty confident here but still wondering whether I had overlooked something.
1227,34,25,2Nc4,b'2b2r2/2N1qpk1/2Q2n1p/3p4/2n5/pN2PPP1/4BK2/7R w - -',Hmm... could be trouble. I thought about Bxc4 dxc4 Qxc4 with a better position and pawn structure but thought there must be something better. Of course...!
1228,34,26,2Nxd5,b'2b2r2/4qpk1/2Q2n1p/3N4/2n5/pN2PPP1/4BK2/7R b - -',Now black is in trouble and about to lose his knight at the least. Finally my Rook on h1 that I never wanted to move pays off. He finally is decisive...
1229,34,27,2Nxd5,b'2b2r2/4qpk1/2Q4p/3n4/2n5/pN2PPP1/4BK2/7R w - -',The final losing move...at least he went down swinging.
1230,34,28,2Qxh6+,b'2b2r2/4qpk1/7Q/3n4/2n5/pN2PPP1/4BK2/7R b - -',"Kg8 Qh8#
A very different sort of game but thoroughly enjoyable. This game was all the more important because a win meant 3 of us were going to the next round. A loss or draw meant only gcasanova was. Didn't spend a lot of time in post-analysis on this and I'm sure I missed a lot. My goal is not to give a detailed right move wrong move but rather just to give my thoughts on a complex situation. Overall I think 9...g5 was the big mistake of the game. It was just too dangerous in that situation to expose the king like that. Of course it very well could have worked who knows? I'm sure someone will play the same move against me someday and thoroughly whoop me. Any comments on the game I would love to hear from you.
Thanks for reading

1266,36,2,Bxf7+,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1B1p/8/8/4Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This startled me. I had just come out of a draw with the player after a VERY strenuous match so I knew he was competent. After a short time I saw the threat and was almost on the verge of resigning. Because...
1267,36,3,Ke8,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/8/4N3/4Ppp1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',What now? I'm a piece ahead but as long as he keeps throttling at my kingside mate is an inevitability. Truth be told defense is not exactly my strongest point and I did not see how I could possibly turn this around. Still I played on curious to see how the line would develop.
1268,36,4,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/8/4N3/4Ppp1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Now those pawns on f4 and g4 look silly.
1269,36,5,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/3p4/4N3/4Ppp1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',There's no saving the g4 pawn but I can open a few lines here.
1270,36,6,Nh6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp4p/3p3n/6q1/4PpN1/7P/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I typically hate putting Knights on the edge of the board but I needed my Bishop to cover it instead of relying upon my Queen. Tempi were all-important here and I couldn't afford to squander any.
1271,36,7,Rf8,b'rnb1kr2/ppp4p/3p3b/6q1/4Pp2/5Q1P/PPPP2P1/RNB2RK1 w - -',I knew the f-pawn would be vital so I began to protect it and focus on the f-file. Though my queen is still entirely exposed the opponent is rather underdeveloped and his earlier Castling move now allows me a few opportunities to cramp his king.

1282,37,0,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The french exchange varation is considered inferior to the normal e5.
1283,37,1,Nd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/4B3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',This is the modern way of developing the knight in these types of opennings. The idea behind it is that Nd2 allows white to retain the option of c4. 
1284,37,2,Nf5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p1n2/3P4/4BN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',this move exploits the fact that my bishop has no good retreat squares.

1289,37,7,1Bxc4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3b4/5p2/2BP4/4PN2/PP1N2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This prevents black from castling to safety.
