6,0,6,1Nxc5,b'r5k1/5pp1/1qppbn1p/2N1p3/1nP1P3/3P2NP/1P3PP1/1BBQ1RK1 b - -',Good idea for white abating the battery on the power diagonal but he leaves behind the a1 square.
7,0,7,2Nb5,b'3q2k1/5pp1/3pbn1p/1Np1p3/1nP1P3/3P3P/1P1B1PP1/rB1Q1RK1 b - -',A powerful pin on white's back rank...but why didn't he play 23. Qf3 ...?

9,0,9,2Na3,b'3q2k1/5pp1/3pbn1p/2p1p3/2P1Pn2/N1B4P/1P3PP1/rB1Q1RK1 b - -',I think white was too preoccupied trying to trap my rook on a1 at the expense of allowing a strong attack of minor pieces.
10,0,10,Ne2+,b'3q2k1/5pp1/3pb2p/2p1p3/2P1n3/NQB4P/1P2nPP1/rB3RK1 w - -',This move causes some big problems for white; strengthens the pin on white's light sq bishop and gains a tempo to get the two monster knights in position.

13,0,13,3Nb5,b'q5k1/5pp1/3pb2p/1Np1p1n1/2P5/1QB4P/1P2nPPK/1R6 b - -',??  instead of simply trying to trade down my attack  i.e. 30. Bd2 ...   getting his bishop off of that useless diagonal!!
14,0,14,3Nf4,b'q5k1/5pp1/3pb2p/1Np1p1n1/2P2n2/1QB4P/1P3PPK/1R6 w - -',The knights are fully poised to strike...

17,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I was black in this league game and I am pleased with this game.  Black built a great defence on the queenside and a5 was a move which was integral to black's defence.
18,1,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',After e4 black went with king's pawn to e5 and is stating his aims immediately!
19,1,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White pushed his pawn to c3.  I believe this is a move in the ponziani opening but white would go with Nf3 and then c3.  An expected move might have been d4 to attack e5 and take the centre for white.
20,1,3,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Black decides to go with pawn to f5 attacking the centre pawn himself and not worrying if taken as will block the pawn's route on the f file with Nf6.
21,1,4,exf5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White captures the f5 pawn and the fight is already on for ownership of the centre.
22,1,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops his knight with Nf6 and is attacking squares in the centre of the board.
23,1,6,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White pushes his pawn to d4 attacking black's centre pawn on e5 and making a pawn chain.

25,1,8,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/5P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White decides to prevent the pawn continuing down the e file with Be6.
26,1,9,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',Black gives his e4 pawn further protection with pawn to d5.

29,1,12,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White retreats his LB to e7.  At present it looks quite equal on the control of the centre as white has 3 pawns and a piece and black also has 3 pawns and a piece in the centre.  
30,1,13,a5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq a6',Black pushes a pawn to e5 to give white a problem with accessing the queenside as this pawn is protected by 2 pieces the queen and the rook.

32,1,15,Bxf5,b'rn1qkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black decides to capture the pawn at f5 which did not seem to be important to white as he had not protected it.

35,1,18,1Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/1p5p/2p2np1/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White again retreats his LB after it has done its job and it is safe to attack again.
36,1,19,1Qd7,b'rn2kb1r/1p1q3p/2p2np1/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black now pushes his queen to d7.  This joins the LB on the diagonal but perhaps another piece could have been developed before the queen.  This does now leave the a5 pawn to be protected only by the rook.
37,1,20,1Nd2,b'rn2kb1r/1p1q3p/2p2np1/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P1NBPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',White develops his knight to d2 attacking the pawn at e4 which until then was not attacked but as a very important pawn was being well protected by black (3 times!)  
38,1,21,1Ng4,b'rn2kb1r/1p1q3p/2p3p1/p2p1b2/3Pp1n1/P1P1B3/1P1NBPPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Black moves Ng4 and attacks the DB at e3 which has nowhere to retreat.
39,1,22,1Qa4,b'rn2kb1r/1p1q3p/2p3p1/p2p1b2/Q2Pp1n1/P1P1B3/1P1NBPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',So white leaves the DB on prise and moves his queen to a4.  I don't think the queen will be there long.
40,1,23,1b5,b'rn2kb1r/3q3p/2p3p1/pp1p1b2/Q2Pp1n1/P1P1B3/1P1NBPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq b6',Black pushes his pawn to b5 attacking the queen.  The queen has to retreat as neither of the pawns on a5 or b5 can be captured without risking the queen being captured.
41,1,24,1Qd1,b'rn2kb1r/3q3p/2p3p1/pp1p1b2/3Pp1n1/P1P1B3/1P1NBPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',White's plan so far is move forward and then move back again ie going nowhere.  So white retreats the queen and this will end unhappily for white.

44,1,27,1Qe7,b'rn2kb1r/4q2p/2p3p1/pp1p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1P3/1P1NB1PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Black moves the queen over now to e7 to provide support to the pawn at e4.  Also the queen now has a clear view to h4 and a check on the white king.
45,1,28,1b4,b'rn2kb1r/4q2p/2p3p1/pp1p1b2/1P1Pp3/P1P1P3/3NB1PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq b3',White pushes a pawn to b4 to attack black's pawn at a5 .
46,1,29,1a4,b'rn2kb1r/4q2p/2p3p1/1p1p1b2/pP1Pp3/P1P1P3/3NB1PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Black pushes his a5 pawn to a4 putting a block on the b and a files.  Black now has a good defensive pawn chain which goes from e4 to c6 and c6 to a4.  It seems like black's queenside is safe as houses!
47,1,30,1Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/4q2p/2p3p1/1p1p1b2/pP1Pp1B1/P1P1P3/3N2PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',White decides to exchange his remaining bishop with black's bishop at f5.

50,1,33,1Qxg4,b'rn2kb1r/7p/2p3p1/1p1p1b2/pP1Pp1q1/P1P1P1P1/3N3P/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',So black captured the LB on g4 opposite the white queen still on d1.  This could mean an exchange of queens and black was ready for this.
51,1,34,Bxg4,b'rn2kb1r/7p/2p3p1/1p1p4/pP1Pp1b1/P1P1P1P1/3N3P/R3K1NR w KQkq -',White captured the queen as expected and black recaptured with the LB.

68,1,51,2Rf1,b'2kr1b1r/3n1b2/2p3p1/1p1p2Pp/pP1PpN1R/P1P1P3/3N4/5RK1 b - -',White now brings into play his a1 rook with the move Rf1.

90,1,73,3Nxe3,b'2kr4/8/2p1b1p1/1p1p3p/pP1Pp3/P1P1N3/3N1R2/6K1 b - -',This is what happens and it all looks as if it is over for black with only 2 pieces against 3 BUT he does have 2 pawns coming down the g and h files which could cause white a problem or two yet.  Watch this space.
91,1,74,3g5,b'2kr4/8/2p1b3/1p1p2pp/pP1Pp3/P1P1N3/3N1R2/6K1 w - -',Black pushes a pawn to g5 as he begins to push his 2 queening pawns.  Don't they say that pawns are for pushing.

95,1,78,4h4,b'2kr4/3b4/2p4R/1p1p2p1/pP1Pp2p/P1P1N3/3N4/6K1 w - -',Black pushes h5 pawn to h4 and it is not possible for the h6 rook to capture it as the rook would be recaptured by the g5 pawn.

105,1,88,4e3,b'2k5/3b4/2p4R/1p1p4/pP1P2p1/P1P1prNp/8/5NK1 w - -',Black now pushes another pawn at e4 to e3 protected by the rook at f3.  White may have done better (and avoided letting another pawn out of the box) by moving his g3 knight but he was protecting the h1 square with the g3 knight.
106,1,89,4Ne2,b'2k5/3b4/2p4R/1p1p4/pP1P2p1/P1P1pr1p/4N3/5NK1 b - -',White now moves the g3 knight to e2 and is blocking the progress of the e3 pawn.  The knights are protecting both squares that the g and h pawns would move to so this seems to end black's hopes of queening one of the pawns.
107,1,90,4Bf5,b'2k5/8/2p4R/1p1p1b2/pP1P2p1/P1P1pr1p/4N3/5NK1 w - -',Black moves his LB to f5 and is threatening d3 and an attack on the e2 knight.

113,1,96,4gxf3,b'7R/1k6/2p5/1p1p4/pP1P4/P1Pbpp1p/4N3/6K1 w - -',Black captures the knight with his pawn at g4 and now the e2 knight is attacked by both the LB and the pawn.
114,1,97,5Nf4,b'7R/1k6/2p5/1p1p4/pP1P1N2/P1Pbpp1p/8/6K1 b - -',So white moves his knight to f4 and is attacking the LB.
115,1,98,5f2+,b'7R/1k6/2p5/1p1p4/pP1P1N2/P1Pbp2p/5p2/6K1 w - -',Black however pushes his f pawn to check the king.  With this move white resigns.  The game would have ended in checkmate with the likely moves: 51. kh1 f1=Q+; 52. kh2 Qxf4+; 53. kh1 Be4+; 54. kg1 Qf2#
116,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I start off with my usual.
117,2,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And I'm not surprised to see her play the Reti Defense I believe it's called.  Still develops but my response will be a little different then normal since she is threatening to win a pawn.  So I'll protect in a way that also develops.
118,2,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',With this move we're in familiar territory.  Although it didn't transpose into the Scandinavian Defense since the N aren't out in that defense until we exchanged I'll treat it like it did since this is my style.  This means that we're going to exchange pawns.  
119,2,3,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Unfortunately this game happened before my first lesson with Ken.  Therefore I exchange pieces just because it's possible to do so.  Now how this game occurred after the lesson I would've denied it with 5.Ne2 followed by 6.Nf4 to leave my N well placed as in theory for general games I might need this at a later time.  But since this happened before the game that did not come into consideration.  All I cared about exchanging in order to continue with my development as we'll see when 5.Nf3 is played.
120,2,4,Qe6+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I was not surprised to see this check.  But since my idea as noted was to exchange when possible I block this check with my Queen and prepare to exchange it.
121,2,5,Qf5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/5q2/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',But Annabel declines since she sees something a little better and thus eyes my c2 pawn.
122,2,6,Nd4,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/5q2/3N4/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I had considered protecting by advancing the c pawn.  Another option which did not come into consideration was 7.Qd1  But this was played to harass her Queen.  The goal would be to develop afterwards but I overlooked her next move which hits my N.
123,2,7,Qe3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/2q5/3N4/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Consequently protecting it is the number one priority.
124,2,8,e5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/2q1p3/3N4/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq e6',So she hits again.  And once again I protect by bringing it back to my original square.  But I'm also keeping that her next move therefore will not win a pawn because with the N there once she takes I'll recapture.  So it will be an even exchange.  Part of it is that she must be careful to avoid a discovered check.  As otherwise there will be problems as we're about to see.  It's also worth noting that since this is before my training game I was only going to look at one variation.   And the only variation I looked is what happens here.
125,2,9,Be6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/4N3/8/4Q3/PPqP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',As I was planning to play my next move anyway just because it worked in one game as at the time that was all that I was thinking about.  But even with this move I'm gonna play it as I have a sac in mind.  And this was btw the continuation of the variation that I studied earlier with 9.Nf3.
126,2,10,Bxc4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/2b5/4Q3/PPqP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',?? As Annabel took which I anticipated.  But I told her that this is a blunder.  Instead better was to protect and prevent what's coming.  By that I was implying that best was 11...f6  By playing this though I have a nasty discovered check which going to win the Rook.  And btw this is the reason why protecting with Nf3 was the only move that came into consideration as otherwise I would've looked at retreating elsewhere.  What I kept in mind for this training game however was something that tactical-abyss from his experience.  That is that most people make this kind of mistake and when they think they can they'll take.  But what they don't know is the consequences affiliated with it like here.  So it is good for learning and another example of where I used TA's method to teach chess.
127,2,11,Bd5,b'rn1k1b1N/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/8/4Q3/PPqP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I'm not exactly sure why she played but nothing stops me from castling here.
128,2,12,Bc5,b'rn1k3N/ppp2ppp/8/2bb4/8/4Q3/PPqP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? Annabel continues with her development but I told her that this is another blunder.  In fact just about anything was better then this move.  That's because of what's about to come which is going to win another piece.  This time though it's without anything in return.  Afterwhich I'm going to win a pawn.  So from here on given that white has a won game after 16.Qxd5+ I don't say anything else because the idea is to stop when there are no good moves left and you have a win as ION mentioned.
129,2,13,1Re1,b'r1k5/pppnbNpp/8/3Q4/8/8/PPqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',With that being said I attack her Be7 by centralizing one of my Rooks.
130,2,14,1c6,b'r1k5/pp1nbNpp/2p5/3Q4/8/8/PPqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',For now she protects by attacking my Queen.
131,2,15,1Qe6,b'r1k5/pp1nbNpp/2p1Q3/8/8/8/PPqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',So I protect by keeping the attack.  Therefore she finds another way to protect.
132,2,16,2Qe8+,b'r1k1Q3/pp1n1Npp/2p2b2/8/8/8/PPqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',But that does not bother me because with this move I'm going to win her other Rook.  At this point were I black I'd resign right here due to the ruinous loss of material that I'd be faced with.  She not to my surprise however plays on.
133,2,17,Bxb2,b'Q7/ppkn1Npp/2p5/8/8/8/PbqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Thinking that she's got a pawn in return Annabel takes here but overlooks the mate that is about to come.  21...Qb6 would've held it off longer but it's still a lost position for black.  For had she played that I would've continued by exchanging bishops since I'm that far ahead.  From there she'd have nothing left anyhow.
134,2,18,2Qd8#,b'3Q4/ppkn1Npp/2p5/8/8/8/PbqP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',After this mate I reviewed the game with Annabel.  And I told her that black's decisive mistake was taking my B since that overlooked the check which got the R instead.  As from there it was gonna go downhill.  So I told her that the moral of this story is that to take is a mistake.  In other words don't take just because it's there and you can.  Instead ask yourself what danger lies ahead.  And what happens from there.  After that she thanked me for taking the time to teach her.  In addition I would as usual like to thank TA for giving that mini lesson.  Which is that many people make that kind of mistake because I was able to keep that in mind for this training game.  In doing so another student of mine learned some chess as a direct result.

My first reaction was that it just lost a pawn - it took me a minute or so to realise that the queen on its rather unusual square of e8 was protecting it. I had a long think here. I considered lines such as 16.	Bxc6	Qxc6 17. cxb5 but that doesn't work as he has a queen check on b6. I looked at 16. Bxc6 Qxc6 17.	Bxe7	bxc4 but the rook and pawn I get for my two bishops is an unfavourable trade. So eventually I decided on another continuation.

When I first started learning openings my response to d4 as Black was the Dutch. My reasoning was it's superficial similarity to the King's Gambit which I was playing as White at the time.

I dropped it in favour of the King's Indian Defence as the Indian is more popular. Perhaps mistakenly I assumed if finer chess brains than me had made the King's Indian popular it must really be better.

Qf7 and checkmate follows) 31. Qf7+ Kf5 32. Rd3! and the threat of Bd7+ is deadly for example: 32...e4 33. Bd7+ Ke5 34. Qe6+ Kf4 35. g3#.

360,8,43,2e4,b'b1r5/2q3k1/5p1p/1Bn3p1/P1Q1p2P/5P2/1PP2BP1/3R3K w - -',Black could have traded a piece for two pawns: 29...Ne4 30. Qxc7+ Rxc7 31. fxe4 Rxc2 32. Kg1 Rxb2 (or Bxe4). Considering the fact the a- b- and c-pawns are all passed pawns that could have been a fair trade.

362,8,45,3Qxc5,b'b1r5/6k1/5p1p/1Bq3p1/P1Q1p2P/5P2/1PP3P1/3R3K w - -',But Black won't be checkmated after taking back.
363,8,46,3Rd7+,b'b1r5/3R2k1/5p1p/1Bq3p1/P1Q1p2P/5P2/1PP3P1/7K b - -',Now the king is in real danger.
364,8,47,3Kg6,b'b1r5/3R4/5pkp/1Bq3p1/P1Q1p2P/5P2/1PP3P1/7K w - -',All other moves lead to a quick checkmate. For example 31...Kh8 32. Qf7! and there is nothing Black can do.
365,8,48,3Qf7+,b'b1r5/3R1Q2/5pkp/1Bq3p1/P3p2P/5P2/1PP3P1/7K b - -',This check forces the king to the center of the board.

368,8,51,3c3,b'2r5/3R1Q2/5p1p/1Bq2kp1/P3b2P/2P5/1P4P1/7K b - -',A blunder. I threw away the win. The c-pawn was not important but the safety of my king was. Correct was 34. Re7! Qxc2 35. Bd7+ Kf4 36. Qxf6+ Ke3 (36...Kg3 37. Qe5+ Kf2 38. Qd4+ Ke1 39. Rxe4+ and checkmate follows after Black gives up his queen) 37. Qf3+ Kd4 38. Qxe4+ Qxe4 39. Rxe4 Kxe4 40. Bxc8 with an elementary win.
369,8,52,3Qf2,b'2r5/3R1Q2/5p1p/1B3kp1/P3b2P/2P5/1P3qP1/7K w - -',Black finds one of the drawing moves. A checkmate and a perpetual check are threatened and I cannot defend against both of them.
370,8,53,3Rd5+,b'2r5/5Q2/5p1p/1B1R1kp1/P3b2P/2P5/1P3qP1/7K b - -',Objectively I should have played 35. Rd2! Qxh4+ 36. Kg1 Qe1+ 37. Kh2 Qh4+ and so forth but not 37...Qxd2 which lets me back into the game: 38. Qd7+ Qxd7+ 39. Bxd7+ Ke5 40. Bxc8 with a pawn up. The move played in the game sets up a little trap.
371,8,54,3Bxd5,b'2r5/5Q2/5p1p/1B1b1kp1/P6P/2P5/1P3qP1/7K w - -',Black falls for the trap. Correct was 35...Kg4! 36. Qd7+ f5 37. Rd2 Bxg2+! 38. Kh2 Qg3+! 39. Kg1 Bc6+ and I lose my queen.
372,8,55,3Qxd5+,b'2r5/8/5p1p/1B1Q1kp1/P6P/2P5/1P3qP1/7K b - -',Now I can play to win.
373,8,56,3Kg6,b'2r5/8/5pkp/1B1Q2p1/P6P/2P5/1P3qP1/7K w - -',Relatively best.
374,8,57,3Bd3+,b'2r5/8/5pkp/3Q2p1/P6P/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K b - -',This does not lead anywhere. The winning move was 37. Qe4+! f5 38. Qe6+ Kg7 39. Qd7+ Kg6 40. Qxc8 Qxh4+ 41. Kg1 Qe1+ 42. Bf1 Qe3+ 43. Kh1 and Black runs out of checks. This is just an example but other lines are similar. The idea is to pick the c8 rook with queen checks and move the bishop to f1 after Qe1+.
375,8,58,3Kh5,b'2r5/8/5p1p/3Q2pk/P6P/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K w - -',This is the only move that doesn't lose. I saw this already when I played Rd5+ but I thought I would be able to find something against it. Wishful thinking doesn't help to win chess games.
376,8,59,3Qf7+,b'2r5/5Q2/5p1p/6pk/P6P/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K b - -',Again a bad move. 38. Qe6 would have kept the game going on for a while.
377,8,60,3Kxh4,b'2r5/5Q2/5p1p/6p1/P6k/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K w - -',Now I don't have checks and my king is starting to feel uncomfortable.
378,8,61,3Qe6,b'2r5/8/4Qp1p/6p1/P6k/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K b - -',What else?
379,8,62,3g4,b'2r5/8/4Qp1p/8/P5pk/2PB4/1P3qP1/7K w - -',Winning. Black can afford to leave the rook without protection. Moving my queen away from protecting the e1-square leads to checkmate.
380,8,63,4Qe2,b'2r5/8/5p1p/8/P5pk/2PB4/1P2QqP1/7K b - -',Desperate moves continue.
381,8,64,4Qxe2,b'2r5/8/5p1p/8/P5pk/2PB4/1P2q1P1/7K w - -',This might be a practical move but 40...Kg3 was even better. The idea is to bring the rook to the attack via d8. It would threaten to take the bishop at d3 followed by checkmate or to play the rook to the second rank. There is nothing I could do against this plan.
382,8,65,Kg3,b'2r5/8/5p1p/8/P5p1/2P3k1/1P2B1P1/7K w - -',This is still winning.

I just have to be sure the exchange leaves an edge to me. And this is not QxQ (I'll have pressure on e6 but not all that definitive. I can get more from this). If Bxf5 after the Q's exchange he'll be able to play Bc5 getting strong pressure... but I sensed it was handable with his K so weakly placed. I couldn't caculate of course.

414,10,1,dxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black captured the pawn at c3 with his d4 pawn.
415,10,2,Nxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White captured back with his knight.  So now white is in control of the centre.  But I am sure it won't be for long.
416,10,3,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1b2P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops his DB to b4 and is attacking white's knight at c3.  White is still going to have a fight to maintain his monopoly on the centre.
417,10,4,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1b2P3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White moves his DB to d2 to avoid using his pawn if the knight is captured.
418,10,5,Qf6,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Now black moves his queen to f6 and attacks the knight again.

420,10,7,Qd6,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3q4/8/1b2P3/2N2Q2/PP1B1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black moves his queen to d6 and is now attacking the DB at c2 which is protecting the knight.
421,10,8,Bd3,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3q4/8/1b2P3/2NB1Q2/PP1B1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',White brings out his LB to d3 with the queen protecting it.
422,10,9,a6,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/8/1b2P3/2NB1Q2/PP1B1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Black moves his pawn to a6 which protects the square b5 in case white's knight tries to extricate itself from c3.
423,10,10,Bf4,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/8/1b2PB2/2NB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',White decides the pawn can be used in the case of the capture of the knight at c3 and now moves his DB to f4 and is attacking the queen at d6.
424,10,11,Qd4,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/1b1qPB2/2NB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Black moves his queen to d4.  Black does not seem to be developing many pieces just moving his queen around.  White has 4 pieces developed and black has developed only 2 pieces.
425,10,12,Nge2,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/1b1qPB2/2NB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White now develops his final piece to e2 and the king can now castle short or long but I think short may be preferable with the threat of the queen and bishop on the queenside.
426,10,13,Bxc3+,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/3qPB2/2bB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Now black decides to capture the knight at c3 with the DB.
427,10,14,1bxc3,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/3qPB2/2PB1Q2/P3NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White recaptures with the pawn as the knight gives this pawn protection and it leaves the knight covering the DB at f4 too.  Now the pawn is attacking the queen at d4.
428,10,15,1Qb6,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/pq6/8/4PB2/2PB1Q2/P3NPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black moves the queen to b6.

The only piece that was unprotected before was the rook at a1 but this is also now protected.
432,10,19,1Qa3,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/4P3/q1PBBQ2/P3NPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black queen now moves to a3 and is purely an object for white to attack should the opportunity arise.  I would think black would perhaps now try to develop and make his plan of attack on the white king.  However I think white's king is pretty well protected at present.  Whilst the black king is left in the middle with a weak square in front of him which perhaps black would like white to attack but white is no rush.
433,10,20,1Bc1,b'rnb1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/8/4P3/q1PB1Q2/P3NPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',White wants to remove the black queen so moves the DB to c1 attacking the queen at a3.

480,10,67,3Bxa4,b'5r2/2p2pkp/pp3n2/2n5/b1P2Qp1/4R1P1/4B2P/4R1K1 w - -',White's move allowed the capture of the pawn at a4 by black's LB.

486,10,73,3a5,b'5r1k/2p2p1p/1p6/p1n5/b1P3Q1/4R1P1/7P/4R1K1 w - -',Black pushes his pawn to a5 and he has a pawn chain from c7 to a5.  In total black has 5 pawns but the king's pawns are useless as they are not joined since the g pawn has now been captured.  White only has 3 pawns and one of these is an isolated pawn at c4.  The other 2 pawns are in front of the king still.

Ba3. However it was later pointed out that black can play Nd7 to prepare c7-c5 if necessary sacrificing a pawn and so black need not fear 7. Ba3 so I prefer to to play Bg7 and 0-0 first and avoid variations where white may throw in Bb5+ - not that black need fear this move either but I haven't learned about it!"
539,12,5,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1B3/P4PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2 often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5 playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s however Karpov Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3 Qd2 and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre remove White's rook from the diagonal and possibly enable an early d5 push by White. Playing 7. Be3 keeps white's options open.
540,12,6,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1B3/P4PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',According to plan.
541,12,7,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Ruling out the old main line of Bc4 and Ne2.
542,12,8,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ c6',So I do the thematic push.
543,12,9,Rc1,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R b K -',Moving his rook off the a1-h8 diagonal I was rather afraid of him playing d4-d5 followed by c3-c4 at some stage which is why I did the following exchange.
544,12,10,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3pP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R w K -',Now taking with knight or bishop leaves his pawn on c3 very weak - it is isolated and exposed to attack along the diagonal and the file.
545,12,11,1cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/4BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R b K -',So this recapture is virtually forced.
546,12,12,1Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R w K -',Indirectly attacking d4. If I were to take on f3 now if he took back with the queen I could take on d4.
547,12,13,1Be2,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P3BPPP/2RQK2R b K -',So he prevents that. Now I decided that I had better check on a5 now otherwise he will castle and then it is not check.
548,12,14,1Qa5+,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP1b1/4BN2/P3BPPP/2RQK2R w K -',So I threw in the check.
549,12,15,1Qd2,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2QBPPP/2R1K2R b K -',Otherwise he loses the a2 pawn.
550,12,16,1Qxd2+,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2qBPPP/2R1K2R w K -',So I take.
551,12,17,1Kxd2,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2KBPPP/2R4R b - -',He takes back. Because of his better development and strong centre white has an edge in this position but I correctly guessed that my young opponent had yet to master the grand-master skills of grinding out a win in endings like this!
552,12,18,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2KBPPP/2R4R w - -',So I develop.

570,13,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',This was a game I won in my reti mini-tournament.   The reti opening is named after Richard Reti and he was one of the top players during 1910s and 1920s.  Born 28 May 1889  in Pezinok (Austrian-Hungarian) and died 6 June 1929.  In New York 1924 Richard Reti played a game against Raul Capablanca which he won.  This was Capablanca's only defeat in 8 years and also the first defeat since becoming world champion. https://www.chess.com/article/view/richard-rti
571,13,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The reti opening starts with Nf3 and white is trying to control the centre without using his 2 centre pawns.   I set up the mini tournament with 1.Nf3 d5 2. c4 and play then proceeds from there.  I went with nf6 protecting my d5 pawn.  This is a safe move but it keeps black in the centre rather than taking on c4 which would leave a weakness or an open file in the centre of the board giving access to the black king early on.  
572,13,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White moves his pawn to e3 allowing his bishop to protect the c4 pawn.
573,13,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black develops his knight to c6 giving him more central control.
574,13,4,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White develops his LB to e3 and now has access to 2 diagonals and his king can castle.

582,13,12,b4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/1PP5/P3PN1P/3PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 b - b3',White pushes another pawn to b4 and it seems his attack is going to come from the queen side.
583,13,13,Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n3p1/3pp2n/1PP5/P3PN1P/3PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Black moves his f3 knight to h5 to allow his queen access to the diagonal to h4 thinking that white's f3 knight may come down to g5 and also ready to begin an attack. Also it allows the f7 pawn to be pushed.  Black needs to be careful as the knight has no safe squares to use on white's side of the board.
584,13,14,b5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n3p1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3PN1P/3PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',White pushes the b pawn up to b5 and is attacking black's c6 knight.

589,13,19,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1n1bp/4bpp1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3P2P/1B1PBPP1/RN1QNRK1 w - -',Black now develops his LB to e6 and has 2 diagonals to access and is also protecting the pawn at d5 but this already has 2 protectors in the e7 knight and d8 queen.
590,13,20,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1n1bp/4bpp1/1P1pp2n/2P3P1/P3P2P/1B1PBP2/RN1QNRK1 b - g3',White now attacks the h5 knight with pawn to g4.

Not sure this was entirely necessary but it may have been the fact that the LB and queen were in a battery on d1 and e2 pointing at h5.
592,13,22,1gxh5,b'r2q1r2/ppp1nkbp/4bpp1/1P1pp2P/2P5/P3P2P/1B1PBP2/RN1QNRK1 b - -',White captures the knight at h5 with g4 pawn.

618,13,48,2d3,b'4rrk1/p1pq2bp/1p6/1P1P1ppP/6B1/P1NPPQ1K/1B6/R7 b - -',White pushes a pawn to d3 which I don't think is a good move with the black rook at e8 because when the pawn was at d2 it was protecting the e3 pawn.  The queen is also alongside the e3 pawn at f3.

620,13,50,2Qxg4,b'4rrk1/p1pq2bp/1p6/1P1P2pP/6Q1/P1NPP2K/1B6/R7 b - -',White's queen captures the pawn at g4.  The queens are on the same diagonal and could be exchanged.  But white's queen cannot move as it is now pinned to the king at h3.  So an attack on the king by another piece would mean the white queen would be unable to move away or capture the piece.

But was it sound in this position? Hard to tell. 24... Bxg2 25. KxB but after f4+ or Qg4+ Kh1 and white can play Rg1. I well could have told about how I threw away the game for this choice just pretending to be a GM. I can't see how white can defend. But I see how to attack.

Ng3 although I can get a pawn for the exchange I don't think it is enough which is why I decided against playing it. I also thought in this position he is threatening to drop his Nh5 into g3 and if I take it he takes back with the pawn with a discovered attack. For that reason I decided to move my king off the same diagonal as his bishop.

727,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with my usual.
728,18,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',At first I didn't know what this was called.  It seems like the Baseman Defense but 1...b5 is played.  But I remembered because this was Ken played against me in our second game.  And it is the Owen's Defense.  However after what happened with Ken I'm not going to be taken completely off guard this time around.  Since however I'm still learning I'm going to follow book moves here.  And that starts with my next one.
729,18,2,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Not surprisingly he plays this.  I say this because it's how I think as noted in one of charleshiggie's more recent annotations.  The idea is fianchetto as early as the first move to form a nice long flank.  And what adds meaning is that it is not blocked by his N which would happen if he played something like 1...Nf6.  And with it he targets my e pawn.
730,18,3,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"And I protect it with this move.  Now another option was 3.Bd3  But since I'm not that familiar with the Owen's Defense I'm treating it like we're using Fischer Controls where the pieces are set up differently.  So my take on that is ""Know your principles""  That means follow the guidelines carefully.  And what I remember is that the N should be developed before the B."
731,18,4,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Likewise Henry continues developing by opening up a line for his Bf8.  His other plan is to pin my Nc3.  But that doesn't bother me.  First I continue with my development and when he pins...
732,18,5,Bd2,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Regardless of what side it's on this is how I break the pin.  In addition this develops even more.
733,18,6,a5,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp1ppp/1p2p3/p7/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq a6',At first I didn't see the point of this move.  But Henry plays this to get a pawn chain and a semi open (I believe).  I say that because on the Q side his pawns are only on one color.  And it's like that until we get to the d file.  But I think it's an inaccuracy because it doesn't develop.  More importantly however is that it blocks his mobility of his Bb4.
734,18,7,Bd3,b'rn1qk1nr/1bpp1ppp/1p2p3/p7/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',With that being said I continue developing.  I do keep in mind that he'll exchange my N for B.  I did ask myself if it was worth it and if I get anything out of it.  For me it's a no but there is no choice.  With that pin he's going to force.  This is why after 3...e6 I think it would've been better to defend with the move played here.  I thought nothing of this pin since it happens a lot.  But small details can make a huge difference.  And the difference is that he exchanges when I'm least ready to do it.
735,18,8,Nf6,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp1ppp/1p2pn2/p7/3PP3/2BB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',And that allows him to continue with his development.
736,18,9,e5,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp1ppp/1p2pn2/p3P3/3P4/2BB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I considered castling here.  But I remember a similar position appearing in the French Defense.  And it was in a lecture by GM Susan Polgar.  She said in that position the best move is this.  That boils down to kicking the N since it's forced to exchange.  In the process not only do you gain tempo but you have a solid pawn chain in the center which is where it's most needed.
737,18,10,Nd5,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp1ppp/1p2p3/p2nP3/3P4/2BB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',As expected.  Once again I asked myself if exchanging was appropriate.  Unlike before I was ready to do it but what stopped me was that I'd wind up with doubled in the process.  Since this is now the midgame by my books I feel that allowing doubled pawns would not be a good way to go.  So I do the same thing that Ken did with me in our first training game by retreating rather then give into Henry again.
738,18,11,Nc6,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1ppp/1pn1p3/p2nP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Which enables him to continue with his development.
739,18,12,1Ng5,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1ppp/1pn1p3/p2nP1N1/3P4/3B4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Rather then castle I asked myself if I have a threat that would be difficult to drive off.  At first I thought of this move as a cheapo tactic and almost castled.  But then I looked again at the board.  And then what occurred to me was what happened in my game against bhidragon since there are similarities with this position.  The entire story for my side isn't just my Ng5 and Bd2.  As now my Qd1 is also a key player.  And with it the threat is difficult as I'm targeting his weakness being his f7 pawn since that's the weakest pawn on the board.  So I allow him to take a center pawn.  For in exchange I play my next move and threaten Qf3 which would pose difficulties for Henry to handle.
740,18,13,1O-O,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1ppB/1p2p3/p3P1N1/1n1n4/8/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',What I forgot is that his Nd3 prevents me from doing it.  And I believe it or not considered 12.Qh5 to threaten mate.  But this time it would be easy to drive off.  Thus it would become a cheapo tactic which would give a space advantage after 12...g6  So I played this to connect the Rooks but forgot that 12.c3 was best as this wins material.
741,18,14,1g6,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1p1B/1p2p1p1/p3P1N1/1n1n4/8/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Figuring that I'd move my Queen to h5 regardless Henry plays this.  But I'm not interested because of what I know.  Instead I play the move that was available a move earlier with the same result.
742,18,15,Ndc2,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1p1B/1p2p1p1/p3P1N1/1n6/2P5/PPnB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',For now Henry holds off on what's to come by hitting my Rook.  So I go after him again.
743,18,16,1Rc1,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1p1B/1p2p1p1/p3P1N1/1n6/2P5/PPnB1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',If however the N stays there he prevents me from taking but then I'd hit his N with 15.a3.  But he makes a mistake by taking on a2 (presumably to prevent me from hitting it.)  That's fine because I take back on c2 winning a piece for pawn.
744,18,17,Bd5,b'r2qk2r/2pp1p1B/1p2p1p1/p2bP1N1/8/2P5/nPRB1PPP/3Q1RK1 w kq -',In this position Henry is trying to pin and win my R with Bb4.
745,18,18,1c4,b'r2qk2r/2pp1p1B/1p2p1p1/p2bP1N1/2P5/8/nPRB1PPP/3Q1RK1 b kq -',So I put a stop to that by hitting his B.  Once he retreats I think about where my decisive mistake occurred against Ken in our second game.  As he said that my assessment about mobility need to be better.  That's where I didn't defend accurately and once his N came down he was going to win a piece without compensation.  So I think along the same line with 17.b3 thinking that he did not evalulate correctly.  But what I overlooked was where he retreat.  For that is going to prevent me from taking his N as his N will be protected by the pawns.  Though now I regret it and think that better was to exchange since I'm ahead.  But it's difficult to know.  What I know is that when I blunder that N will cause damage and by not taking it will become dangerous.  So I should've exchanged but evaluated incorrectly myself.  That's because my focus became trying to take away his weakest pawn on the board in an attempt to expose his K which was foolish.
746,18,19,1Bxg6,b'r2qk2r/1bpp1p2/1p2p1B1/p3P1N1/1nP5/1P6/2RB1PPP/3Q1RK1 b kq -',? What also came into consideration was 18.Qf3 but Henry would be able to prevent mate with 18...Rf8 so it would've been unsound.  Therefore best was 18.Bxb4 at once.  However he would grab my Ng5 which leaves the Rook attacked which I didn't want to allow.  But by playing this he equalizes.  
747,18,20,1Qg4,b'r2qk2r/1bpp4/1p2p1p1/p3P1N1/1nP3Q1/1P6/2RB1PPP/5RK1 b kq -',?? Don't be fooled though as that's where my plan to get a passed pawn came in place.  Therefore I saw that he would play 19...Nxc2.  But if I retreated he would keep hitting it with his Nb4 which is why better would've been to exchange.  And with it being said given that I also didn't want to retreat this sac was deliberate.  As I thought that in the process I'm gaining the time that I need to get a passed pawn.  It was only after a lecture with Jack and my win against Ted that I realized that I need to consider more then just passed pawns in my assessments since I had one in that same game where I blundered a piece for two pawns and should've lost.  But just one passer wouldn't have cut the mustard.  Yet I was also thinking about what Jack told me when I wrongly thought that Tom had a win after resigning.
748,18,21,1Nxc2,b'r2qk2r/1bpp4/1p2p1p1/p3P1N1/2P3Q1/1P6/2nB1PPP/5RK1 w kq -',With that being said this is actually how I get the passer but it involves sacking a piece for two pawns.
749,18,22,2Qxe6+,b'r2qk2r/1bp5/1p2Q1p1/p3P3/2P5/1P6/2nB1PPP/5RK1 b kq -',As now there is nothing aside from or in front of my e5 which is why it's a passed pawn.  And instead of getting nervous this is where I become confident and feel that I have a win.  But because I misunderstood what Jack Stockel (in which it's very common for me to misunderstand things my assessment was way off.)  And this is where I realize that I've got even more to learn.
750,18,23,2Qxg6,b'r2q1k1r/1bp5/1p4Q1/p3P3/2P5/1P6/2nB1PPP/5RK1 b - -',"?? His next move is where I figure out that I'm in rough shape.  In this case it was an oversight.  As the plan behind this was to play 23.Bh6+.  Obviously if he takes my B then I'd take back.  But I had anticipated ...Ke8 to follow after which I'd follow up with e6 to threaten mate.  Yes it can be driven off so it was not the main reason for that line.  Instead what came to mind is that ""Passed pawns must be pushed.""  Afterall that fact is what makes them dangerous.  But his next move prevents all of that since I overlooked where his Queen is located.  In return that piece is gone for a pawn."
751,18,24,2Qf5+,b'r4k1r/1bp5/1p6/p3PQ2/2P5/1P6/2nq1PPP/5RK1 b - -',Thinking that I might be able to get a draw perhaps or maybe the slightest chance of a win I place Henry in check.  And that's because of what follows when he gets out.  I thought that I could still do a lot of damage with my passed pawn.
752,18,25,Rf8,b'r3kr2/1bp5/1p2P3/p4Q2/2P5/1P6/2nq1PPP/5RK1 w - -',But he stops that with this move since my plan was to check him with 26.Qf7+ followed by advancing the pawn.  Yes I thought that if Henry did blunder I could push the pawn and promote which is why I voluntarily gave up so much material as opposed to defending.  But as we're going to see it's not going to work out.
753,18,26,2Qe5,b'r3kr2/1b6/1pp1P3/p3Q3/2P5/1P6/2nq1PPP/5RK1 b - -',After the check since my Rook is useless with a back rank mate threat I bring my Queen behind the passed as it involves the same idea as putting your R behind it.
754,18,27,2Nd4,b'r3kr2/1b6/1pp1P3/p3Q3/2Pn4/1P6/3q1PPP/5RK1 w - -',This is where I overlook what Henry is about to do.  At first I thought that he would take my e pawn.  And if he did I'd take with check which is where I thought I had counterplay.  As now another thing that came into consideration is the move that I play next as I have a pawn chain.  The idea was to then push with 28.f5 and then 29.f6 because white could promote in a situation like this.
755,18,28,Ne2+,b'r3kr2/1b6/1pp1P3/p3Q3/2P2P2/1P6/3qn1PP/5RK1 w - -',But what didn't come to mind was why the N was out which is this move.  After which I considered 28.Kh1 to keep the monarch in the corner.  But after 28...Rxf4 29.Qxf4 Nxf4 he mates by taking on g2 or h2.  Seeing that I played my next move as I thought that I was out of trouble even after he takes.
756,18,29,Rxf4+,b'r3k3/1b6/1pp1P3/p3Q3/2P2r2/1P6/3qnKPP/5R2 w - -',But I thought that Henry would take with the N instead.  Consequently I'm still forced to lose my Queen.
757,18,30,Nxf4+,b'r3k3/1b6/1pp1P3/p7/2P2n2/1P6/3q1KPP/5R2 w - -',I resigned here because after getting out of check Henry is going to play 30...Qxg2 which forces my King away from the Rook.  From then he is going to win that also.  And with it I resigned due to not being able to make any more use of my passed pawn.  In my resignation I said that the reason for sacking so much material was to get that passed pawn.  But now that you have won my Queen and are about to get my Rook there's nothing that I can do for that passer.  Consequently there is no more that I can get from the game.  In general pieces are worth more then pawns.  But because of that lecture combined with how most GM's win I thought that the only exception to that rule is when that pawn is a passer.  That's why I gave them away for that.  However I learned that even with passed pawns that general fact still holds.  And the other thing to learn (which I frequently forget) is that the assessment should come from the position itself and not from a game.  When I evaluate it's almost always from a past game.  But that's because the position allowed it.  Therefore just because it works in one game doesn't mean that it will for another.  And with that being said as the title says passed pawns aren't everything.  In fact what I learned here is that for just one pieces are still worth more.  That's because even with one passer the opponent can stop it with his pieces.  When that happens your plan fails which is what leads to your downfall.  That is exactly what occured here.

Nd6+ Kf8 he would be threatening to free his position with c6-c5. Fritz actually gives Rg1 as the best move and Nd6+ as the second best move.

885,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I recently annotated a game where I was white vs the pirc defense and I found it a lot of fun to do. So I thought I would do another as it was a different line of the same opening one where mistakes were made and I had ideas at the time that I think were probably not so good as I look back on them. Also a fun game which is good. 
886,22,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Pirc defense. 
887,22,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',Mainline here is g6 to which I enjoy slamming down f4 and playing the Austrian Attack. This move is second most popular here on the databases (about 34000 to 8000) but both are seen a lot even at high level of play. g6 leads to a sharp game where a draw is not likely but white has an edge they can push if they play precisely. e5 is a little more drawish challenging the center immediately with the possibilities of mass trades later in the game. 
888,22,3,Nge2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A bit of a sideline. Nf3 is by far the most popular move here but I want to leave f4 as a possible move later should my opponent castle kingside. I can go queenside and push f4 h4 and get a nice attack going. The problem with that is that the light squared bishop is trapped in if I don't push g3 myself and if I do push g3 I weaken my light squares a little on the king side. Not the worst set up but double-edged. 
889,22,4,g3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',And then I do it immediately after being concerned about the weakening effect. Pretty clever of me. If I'm going to do it though right away is a good idea playing Bg2 later to defend e4 in some lines. Might allow for a Nd5.
890,22,5,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N3P1/PPP1NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',As far as I could tell this is a novelty on the databases. I had not considered this move. The light squared bishop is black's good bishop (his pawns are on dark squares so it is the one with all the threats) and so he doesn't really want to trade it off for a knight as that would mean my light squared bishop would become an unopposed monster should the center ever open up. It is also not clear whether or not the bishop should be here or on d7 or e6 so this might waste a tempo in some lines. Of course you could just take on e2 knight has to take back and maybe play d5 and try to open lines before the king is safely castled. Without a light squared bishop and the dark squared bishop passive opening these lines holds little venom in my opinion but it is a possibility. 
891,22,6,h3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N3PP/PPP1NPB1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I took a very long think before playing this move. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my bishop e3 or g5 and playing Nd5 doesn't really work here because Bxe2 threatens to win a pawn with Qxe2 exd4. This pawn is probably not being kept long term but black is close to equal if not better in this position so I that seemed bad. The pin makes f4 less enticing as pawn has to take really weakening...everything basically. I still kind of wanted to play f4 at some point and attack on the kingside so castling wasn't super exciting to me. I generally don't like to play both g3 and h3 at the same time as it gives weaker points to try to attack. I assumed he would play Be6 and at some point Qd7 with pretty good pressure aimed at the h3 square. In the end I played h3 because if he retreats I just develop and castle queenside and h3 isn't so weak with the rook staying on the h-file. Maybe I could push g4 as well to start my attack. I'm still not sure about this move but I don't mind it. 
892,22,7,Bh5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p2b/3PP3/2N3PP/PPP1NPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',?! I did not expect this response. I does maintain the somewhat annoying pin of the e2 knight and maybe allow for Bg6 with pressure against e4 in some lines but it is inviting g4 with tempo which was a plan that I already had. I think Be6 or d7 here is probably better or even taking on e2 (though this seems less good all around to me). In the end I think this sequence is why 6..Bg4 is not such a good move in the first place. 
893,22,8,Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p2b/3PP3/2N1B1PP/PPP1NPB1/R2QK2R b KQ -',Developing. I don't want to go Bg5 because it is in the way of a potential pawn advance there and really ties me up if I try to get an attack going. I've basically decided at this point that I would go Qd2 and O-O-O at some point. 
894,22,9,g4,b'r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/3p1n2/4p2b/3PP1P1/2N1B2P/PPP1NPB1/R2QK2R b KQ -',Maybe I should Qd2 here. I don't think it matter if I do this pawn move or the queen move first if I'm planning to play both but in general moving pawns is the more forceful as they can't move back if you decide it's a mistake later on so unless I see a forcing continuation then keeping options open is generally better. 
895,22,10,c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2pp1nb1/4p3/3PP1P1/2N1B2P/PPPQNPB1/R3K2R w KQ -',Stopping any future idea of Nd5. This move seems close to forced somewhere in here.

I get the bishop pair if I want it as well as pressure against g7 if pop my knight in there. I could castle queenside here before playing this move but (similarly to Sicilian lines) I will attack on the kingside and black will counter on the queenside. My attack looks stronger but the king might be safer in the middle. Maybe. Or maybe I should just castle. Not sure. 
897,22,12,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/p2nbppp/2pp1nb1/1p2p3/3PP1P1/P1N1B1NP/1PPQ1PB1/R3K2R b KQ -',Taking a move off to try to prevent b4 with tempo and queenside pressure.

The game right now is quite sharp with black having space and a potential attack on the queenside and white having space and a potential attack on the kingside. I think white is better here as their attack is faster and they might be able to tuck the king away on f1 or g1 and be somewhat away from harm. 
900,22,15,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/p1qnbppp/2pp2b1/1p2p1Pn/3PP3/P1N1B1NP/1PPQ1PB1/R3K2R w KQ -',? I think this is a blunder. Lets look at the knight's good squares. That's all of them. There are none. Nf4 loses a pawn right away and the rest are attacked by pawns. This move bascially buries the knight to make matters worse the g6 bishop means pawn g7-g6 protecting the knight isn't possible. This knight is probably doomed. 
901,22,16,1Nf5,b'r4rk1/p1qnbppp/2pp2b1/1p2pNPn/3PP3/P1N1B2P/1PPQ1PB1/R3K2R b KQ -',Pressure is mounting and black's pieces lack coordination.

906,22,21,1c5,b'4rrk1/p1qnbppp/3p4/1pp2PPn/3B4/P1N4P/1PPQ1PB1/2KR3R w - -',This is a double edged move as it opens that really nice d5 square for the knight which comes with tempo. 
907,22,22,1Be3,b'3qrrk1/p2nbppp/3p4/1ppN1PPn/8/P3B2P/1PPQ1PB1/2KR3R b - -',I also considered Bxg7 with 20 f6 to follow. Also f6 immediately seems interesting. This is the most solid option just protecting everything and forcing black to a defensive posture. Qe2 or maybe Bf3 trying to win the h5 knight is a plan here. Can also play Nxe7+ which would win the d6 pawn and threaten the c5 pawn as well. Something like 20. Nxe7+ Qxe7 21. Qxd6 Qxd6 22. Rxd6 and the bishop is attacking c5 and the rook is attacking d7. Black's h5 knight is still out of play and white still has a nasty pawn wall on the 5th rank. Seems good for white. 
908,22,23,1Ne5,b'3qrrk1/p3bppp/3p4/1ppNnPPn/8/P3B2P/1PPQ1PB1/2KR3R w - -',Nc4 and then x3 would let up some pressure. seems as good a plan as any for black here. 
909,22,24,Ng3,b'3qrrk1/p3bppp/3p4/1ppNnPP1/8/P3B1nP/1PP1QPB1/2KR3R w - -',There really aren't any great moves here. Black is just losing a piece. If g6 to protect the knight then 21. f6 traps the bishop at the very least. And the knight is still out of play in that moment with the black king possibly getting mated after the white bishop goes to 3 and takes on h5 with Qxh5 Qh6 Qg7 mate to follow. So black moves the knight to force white to recapture with the pawn. Not sure what the idea here really is other than to leave the bishop on e3 undefended by a pawn which might matter if black can ever discover a pin along the open e file or maybe push those queenside pawns which are somewhat dangerous. 
910,22,25,Nc4,b'3qrrk1/p3bppp/3p4/1ppN1PP1/2n5/P3B1PP/1PP1Q1B1/2KR3R w - -',This is a good square for the knight where maybe Bxg5 gives black some counter-chances.

917,22,32,3Qe8,b'4Qbk1/p4ppp/3p1P2/q2N2P1/7P/1r4P1/1P6/1K1R3R b - -',Ne7+ is coming with mate on f8 to follow. Nice. 
918,22,33,3Rxb2+,b'4Qbk1/p4ppp/3p1P2/q2N2P1/7P/6P1/1r6/1K1R3R w - -',I was a little afraid of a perpetual check here but the knight on d5 and the queen on e8 are actually covering all of the important squares the black queen might have here. Looking back over the game the fact that I just put the knight right back to the d5 square makes me think that taking with the queen on move 23 might have actually been the correct move.
919,22,34,3Kxa3,b'4Qbk1/p4ppp/3p1P2/3N2P1/7P/K5P1/8/3R3R b - -',Of course black gave away his pieces there at the end but he was dead at the end there. I really enjoyed playing this game and my opponent and I messaged back and forth for a bit after the game. I thought he played fine really for most of the game but that move Bg4 early on was probably not a great one and then moving the knight to h5 put t offside so early on in the game where I could improved my position get an attack going and then take it off at my leisure. 
920,23,0,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Game begins fairly routinely by both players until my second move which deviated from the world database but not GameKnot.  
921,23,1,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Move 3 I counter what I perceive to be a threat to my f7 pawn with my Queen. White castles very quickly.

932,23,12,1Nf3,b'rnb1k2r/3p1pp1/p6p/1pb5/4P1nq/PB3N2/2P2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White's knight returns to defend

936,23,16,Nf2#,b'rnb1k2r/3p1pp1/p6p/1pb5/4P3/PB3N2/2P2nPP/RNBQ2RK w kq -',But then the Black Knight takes vengeance on his Queen's death at the hands of white and exacts his revenge by a surprising strike forking White's King and Queen and checkmating white.  White's king had no where to go. Black though severely behind in points at -8 nevertheless pulls off a rather quick and unexpected defeat of white.
937,24,0,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/8/1P1PPNP1/PBP2PBP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Black has set up a Stonewall Dutch while White has fianchettoed both bishops.  Usually the fianchetto is trustworthy against the Dutch.
938,24,1,Bc7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppbn2pp/2p2n2/3ppp2/1P6/P1NPPNP1/1BPQ1PBP/R4RK1 w - -',Black has good central control and with the Dutch is usually trying for a direct Kingside attack.  I think I inadvertently drove his Bishop to a better square.
939,24,2,Nxh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppb3pp/2p5/3pnp1n/1P1Np3/P1NPP1PP/1BP2PB1/3R1RK1 w - -',White tries to exchange off some of the attackers.  Black has more space however and better pieces.
940,24,3,2Rdf1,b'r4rk1/p2b3p/1bp5/3p2pn/5p2/P1NPPRPP/2P1N3/2B2RK1 b - -',This is a blunder.  I had looked at Kg2 which is necessary to cover the h3 pawn.  The continuations after that move are still favorable for Black so I mentally discarded it.  However covering the h3 pawn is not optional.  White's position is already bad and completely falls apart after Bxh3.  Just goes to show that blunders although less common in correspondence chess can still happen in slow games.
941,24,4,g4,b'5rk1/p6p/1bp5/3p3n/3P2p1/P1N1B1P1/2P1N1K1/8 w - -',There are no good continuations here for White down the exchange and a pawn.  White's King is restricted and there are plenty of files for Black's Rook to create havoc.
942,24,5,Bc7,b'5rk1/p1b4p/2p5/8/3PpNp1/P3B1P1/2P3K1/8 w - -',Ne6 trades off the Knight for Bishop but still leaves Black an easily won endgame.
943,24,6,Rxf4+,b'6k1/p6p/2p5/8/3Pprp1/P5P1/2P2K2/8 w - -',This wasn't necessary but it works too.  
944,24,7,h5,b'8/8/2p1k3/p1P4p/P2PpPp1/8/5K2/8 w - h6',The passed pawn on the h-file wins easily.  Black has three passers and White cannot stop them all.  If Black makes the mistake of advancing his King too far White's c pawn can sneak through.
945,24,8,Kxf5,b'8/8/2p5/p1P2k1p/P2Pp1p1/8/5K2/8 w - -',I resigned here.  Black would have to blunder badly (like moving the King to f4) to lose this endgame.  The e and h pawns are too widely separated for White to stop.
946,25,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I would've played something else as per reversion's advice to try different openings.  But we're at a time where I took a big cut in my games due to a busy schedule.  And while we're there I decided to just stick with what I know to avoid taking any chances.  So I prepare for the Berlin Wall should he play the Spanish Opening.
947,25,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But he plays the Guaco Piano.

949,25,3,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I was surprised to see him play this and deemed it as a ?! move.  As black I wouldn't have played this because it appears to be unsound and even a cheapo tactic.  If he's trying to do what my opponent did in the last team game with that nasty fork it won't work because of what I play next.  And if given the choice because of what Jack showed I'd use my Bc8 and prepare to exchange since that's my bad B.  But the only thing I can do against that threat is block it with my next move.  The only downside is that I don't want to exchange but it's forced in this position.
950,25,4,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I'm not ready to exchange yet.  But in this position there is no choice.  As I considered 5...Ng4 but if I did this would be a free pawn.  And I was determined not to allow that because of Jack's advice of not giving anything away as I have also taught my students.  In fact that's one of the most important things that I have emphasized to them.
951,25,5,Nxf7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2Npp/2n5/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is not a Q sac blitz game that we've been talking about.  So feeling that this might have been a mistake I without any hesitations took his N.  As I was in the process of compensating for the exchange.  As now I felt that he became overly confident here.  That's because I felt that with best play there's a slight chance of getting a draw or possibly winning.  Although I had a feeling that he'd won due to being stronger but keeping in mind what TA taught me I was going to make things as difficult as possible for white.
952,25,6,O-O,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Not surprisingly he castles.
953,25,7,Be6,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n1b3/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Remebering what went wrong in my game against bigpeta by not following up properly after being ahead combine with Jack Stockel's advice to break the pin with the B I don't hesitate to do it as this also develops.  I'm also keeping in mind that it's a matter of time before I complete my development.  And from there I'll try to organize my pieces which is what should've been done there.
954,25,8,Nc3,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n1b3/3np3/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',"Not to my surprise he develops.  But due to being ahead this is where I go back to what used to happen where I'll exchange whenever possible.  Afterall I'm adhering to the chess quote which describes what to do when behind and trying to do it here for an advantage. That is ""Exchange pawns not pieces"""
955,25,9,Kf7,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/4p3/6Q1/2n5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"I also was somewhat similar to my games with Ken not concerned about those checks as I deemed them as nuicanses since I got out of them allright.  My attitude (thought process) is now what.  Another way of putting it after getting out of check is ""is that all you can do?"""
956,25,10,1dxc3,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/4p3/6Q1/2P5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',And when thinking it I calculated this move as now I'm still ahead.  So now I'm feeling more and more comfortable about my position.  And it'll continue this way until I know that I'm lost.
957,25,11,1g6,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2k1p/2n3p1/4p3/6Q1/2P5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Without worrying about anything I fianchetto for that nice long diagonal.
958,25,12,1f4,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2k1p/2n3p1/4p3/5PQ1/2P5/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - f3',Not knowing why this was played I didn't see the point of this move.  With that I felt that he just waisted tempo when the time could be used to develop his Bc1.  So I use that time to complete my development and place him in check.  I know it's a nuisance.  But once he gets out I'll create a passed pawn and try to use it to my advantage if possible.
959,25,13,1f5,b'r2q3r/ppp2k1p/2n3p1/2b2P2/4p1Q1/2P5/PPP3PP/R1B2R1K b - -',Now he is trying to get a passed pawn.
960,25,14,1g5,b'r2q3r/ppp2k1p/2n5/2b2Pp1/4p1Q1/2P5/PPP3PP/R1B2R1K w - -',So I try to block his Queen in an attempt to stop it.  But this is where I start realizing now that there might have been more then a pawn push.  His next move is check and I start losing confidence here.  He is going to have a nasty check.  Not only that but some of his attacking forces against my King is nastier then I thought.
961,25,15,Kf8,b'r2q1k1r/ppp4p/2n5/2b2PpQ/4p3/2P5/PPP3PP/R1B2R1K w - -',Feeling that the last check was nuicanse I just move back.  But this is where I start to fully realize how bad the position is for black.  You will note that (not the waist of tempo or seeing the point) but the other parts that went into confidence is identical to how I was thinking against Ken in that second game.  That was when I was an entire piece down.
962,25,16,Qd7,b'r4k1r/pppq3p/2n5/2b2PBQ/4p3/2P5/PPP3PP/R4R1K w - -',But now I realize what's going on.  Of course I'm protecting the Queen but there's a little more as he's threatening mate which I'm trying to hold off for the moment.
963,25,17,1f6,b'r4k1r/pppq3p/2n2P2/2b3BQ/4p3/2P5/PPP3PP/R4R1K b - -',And I saw this coming which is setting up that attack since a P+B+Q and are known to win when there are right up against the K.  This is no exception since just like a couple of other games it'll be overwhelming and will force his win quickly.
964,25,18,1Bd6,b'r4k1r/pppq3p/2nb1P2/6BQ/4p3/2P5/PPP3PP/R4R1K w - -',Trying to delay that attack I play this.
965,25,19,1Bh6+,b'r4k1r/pppq3p/2nb1P1B/7Q/4p3/2P5/PPP3PP/R4R1K b - -',But once this was played I resign.  If I play 18...Kg8 he'll mate shortly after 19.Qg5+.  So the only way to prevent is to give up my Queen with 19.Bxg7  From there I don't stand a chance.  So I decided that this was a resignable position.

Instead it ended up being almost a bind type structure where black ends up getting constricted with equal material and white can slowly slowly improve his position. I hurried a little too fast and blundered into a slightly better position that was very tactical and it finished with a nice forced variation. 
990,27,1,d4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',The Pirc Austrian attack. Normally 4.d4 is played move 4 because 4 ..c5 allows black to transpose into some Sicilian-type lines. The opening scores reasonably well for white but is not something get to play very often. I can also be arrived at from 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f4 Bg7 5. Nf3. Both sides have chances but it gives white more attacking chances and black will be required to defend for most of the game and pick their spots. 
991,27,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',The other move here is c5. 
992,27,3,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',There are three main moves here. e5 Bd3 and Be3. Responses to them are very different. I do not know enough about the opening to comment about the major differences in the lines and I chose to play Bd3 to castle kingside. It is also the most common move in databases in this position. e5 is always an idea here to break open the center and get an attack going. Be3 ideas normally lead to queenside castling and h4 h5. e5 immediately leads to trades and a strong pawn center for white.  
993,27,4,b5,b'rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/1p6/3PPP2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - b6',At this point gameknot's computer analysis program considers white to be about a pawn better even though no side has made any inaccuracies or done anything clever. This is due to whites extra space and the fact that white has many attacking chances. 
994,27,5,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/1p2P3/3P1P2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',! The idea of the setup from the start. Attack the knight and get an attack going either on the queenside or kingside depending on how black continues. 
995,27,6,fxe5,b'rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2p2np1/1p2P3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Taking with the d pawn is generally worse because the rook on f1 will have pressure along the open file for the forseeable future. Ideas with Ng5 become possible if the rook moves or Qe1-h4 with an attack against an under-guarded king also become considerations. 
996,27,7,1Be3,b'rn3rk1/p3ppbp/2p1b1p1/1p1qP3/3P4/3BBN2/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Finishing development. c4 at some point here seems pretty good. 
997,27,8,1a4,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2p1b1p1/1p2P3/P2P4/3BBN2/1PP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - a3',If ..bxa4 14. Rxa4 white has all the options with rooks controlling two half open files bishops well placed in the middle and a better center. This has followed the game Alexey Ivanov vs Ivan Morev played in 2004 but just for a few more moves.
998,27,9,1a5,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2p1b1p1/P3P3/1p1P4/3BBN2/1PP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Constricting the knight's movement. I now has basically no good squares. Looking at this position the bishop on g7 looks quite poor staring at a pawn wall and now the knight on b8 has d7 and nothing else as it's future. 
999,27,10,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/p2nppbp/2p1b1p1/P3P3/1pPP4/3BBN2/1P2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - c3',The idea is to play c5 and continue to restrict black's ability to move and defend itself. The computer thinks this is not the best move preferring Bc4 trading light-squared bishops and apparently winning a pawn by force. I did not even consider this move more than just glancing at it. It is worth knowing that the computer's line with a pawn up is good but not clearly winning. This still seems fine to me. 
1000,27,11,1bxc3e.p.,b'r2q1rk1/p2nppbp/2p1b1p1/P3P3/3P4/2pBBN2/1P2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',The first official novelty in the position that I can see. In the game between Ivanov and Morev Bg4 was played but that position white can play c5 and pick up b4 pressure c6 play h3 to kill the white bishop and break through in the center. This seems equally as bad opening the b file totally and they could never really contest it because white's threats are too strong. 
1001,27,12,1Be4,b'r4rk1/p1qnppb1/2p1b1pp/P3P3/2PPB3/4BN2/4Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',This prepares d5 where white would have a great pawn center and can just push down the middle and break open the position with a great idea. It is important that the bishop is on e6 so black can't play c5 trying to close the center down a little. 
1002,27,13,1Bg4,b'r4rk1/p1qnppb1/2p3pp/P3P3/2PPB1b1/4BN2/4Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',..c5 is now possible should white try d5.

The computer actually likes going back to f5 and allowing white to get an attack in on the kingside but it still thinks white is better there. 
1004,27,15,2Qxf3,b'r4rk1/p1qnppb1/2p3pp/P3P3/2PPB3/4BQ1P/6P1/R4RK1 b - -',With a tempo against the c6 pawn which is important in stopping black putting a rook on the b-file.

The black knight has no squares in it's future. The bishop on g7 is trapped. All of black's pieces are locked together defending passively from very few squares and white has time and space to carry out whatever plan it would like to. 
1006,27,17,2Rfb1,b'1nr2rk1/p1q2pb1/P1p1p1pp/2P1P3/3PB3/4BQ1P/6P1/RR4K1 b - -',Threatening Rb7 picking up the a7 pawn which would win the game.

I am not sure if this is the best move here staying solid making black move slowly improving the position. The computer says it is fine though. Mostly I now I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with a plan on where to break through. 
1008,27,19,2h4,b'2q2rk1/p1rn1pb1/P1p1p1pp/2P1P3/3P3P/3BBQ2/6P1/RR4K1 b - -',The idea in my mind was to play g4 as well and try to break through on the kingside if nothing opened up on the queenside. 
1009,27,20,2Re8,b'2q1r1k1/p1rn1pb1/P1p1p1pp/2P1P3/3P3P/3BBQ2/6P1/RR4K1 w - -',Leaving f7 somewhat undefended. This move shows how bad black is because they just cannot escape from their prison in any reasonable way. 
1010,27,21,2Bd2,b'2q1r1k1/p1rn1pb1/P1p1p1pp/2P1P3/3P3P/3B1Q2/3B2P1/RR4K1 b - -',With the threat of Ba5 trapping the rook.

As long as white plays a reasonable move here to defend d4 which is threatened and would give life to his bishop and open the position everything should be fine. 
1012,27,23,3Be4,b'2q1rnk1/p2r1pb1/P1p1p1pp/B1P1P3/3PB2P/5Q2/6P1/RR4K1 b - -',????? Oh No! Black's only good move Rxd4 is basically forced. Here white has thrown away basically all of the advantage they had. doing some move to hold everthing together and not give black counterchances is way. better. White is still better here but not by as much. Not by a long shot. This will now lead into a much more tactical variation where both sides have plans to look out for. Rb4 is probably the best move with Be4 possibly down the line or even doubling on the b-file and infiltrating with the rooks. 
1013,27,24,3Bc3,b'2q2nk1/p3rpb1/P1B1p1pp/2P1P3/3r3P/2B2Q2/6P1/RR4K1 b - -',Up to here was basically forced and when I looked at it back on move 30 I thought I was fine. The other move I considered was Rb7. This is an idea in many of the possible lines with the idea that black was have to play 32..Rxb7 33. cxb7 with Qb8 basically forced and with the queen so passive white might still have something. My concern there was Nd7 really holds things together quite nicely and with the bishop threatening to take on e5 and white's pawns looking like weaknesses instead of strenghts it would be possible black would be able to be better in those lines. I thought the best black had here might be to try to sac an exchange or something. Something like Bxe5 here with Ra3 to follow would keep some sort of material equality with white still coming out ahead. 
1014,27,25,3Rb7,b'2q2nk1/pR2rpb1/P1B1p1pp/2P1P3/2r4P/2B2Q2/6P1/R5K1 b - -',I though this was better than previously because now e5 is defended. 
1015,27,26,3Rxb7,b'2q2nk1/pr3pb1/P1B1p1pp/2P1P3/2r4P/2B2Q2/6P1/R5K1 w - -',?? A blunder. Nd7 is still the move here. This is where I thought an exchance sac would allow black some holding chances. 33..Nd7 34 Rd1 Rxc3 35 Qxc3 Nxe5 (..Qxc6 seems to lead to a long forced line where white is a clear exchange and passed pawn ahead but black has enough to force the perpetual check) 36. Be4 Rd7 and so on with trades and again white is the exhange up with a passed pawn. Probably winning but close. 
1016,27,27,Qb8,b'1q3nk1/pP3pb1/2B1p1pp/2P1P3/2r4P/2B2Q2/6P1/R5K1 w - -',And black's queen is now doomed to guard b8 forever. 
1017,27,28,3Rf1,b'1q3nk1/pP3pb1/2B1p1pp/2P1P3/2r4P/2B2Q2/6P1/5RK1 b - -',This gives up the pawn for the pawn on f7. Black should probably not accept this trade. 
1018,27,29,3Rxc5,b'1q3nk1/pP3pb1/2B1p1pp/2r1P3/7P/2B2Q2/6P1/5RK1 w - -',And black is now dead. They are technically up a pawn at this moment in time but there is no way to hold this position. 35..Rxc3 36. Qxc3 Bxe5 is still worse for black but not completely winning on the spot. 
1019,27,30,3Bb4,b'1q3n1k/pP3Qb1/2B1p1pp/2r1P3/1B5P/8/6P1/5RK1 b - -',Technically not as accurate as the best move (37. Qe8! which I missed completely for some reason) this is totally winning now. Black has no chances. 
1020,27,31,4Bf8+,b'1q3B2/pPr2Q1k/4p1pp/4P3/7P/8/6P1/5RK1 b - -',!! Giving up the queen (temporarily). I enjoyed this because if you don't see this move you might think white needs to back the queen out and give up quite a lot of advantage they have built. Something like 40. Qxe6 Qxb7. White is a piece up with a winning position but at least at my level I lose or draw positions like that sometimes and white's king is not the safest. One poor move and a perpetual becomes possible. Instead white has just clearly finished black off. 
1021,27,32,4Bd6,b'1q4k1/pP3R2/3Bp1pp/4P3/7P/8/6P1/6K1 b - -',The reason this variation works in the first place. Everything just about holds together for white. 
1022,27,33,4Rf8+,b'4qRk1/pP6/3Bp1pp/4P3/7P/8/6P1/6K1 b - -',The evaluation goes to Mate in 12 moves. Exciting stuff. I hope this was enjoyable to read and look at. I definitely enjoyed playing the game and learned some things as well. When you have your opponent dead with no way out of their position (see move 27) take your time and make sure they have no counter-play. I rushed it and let my opponent back into the game. The final series of moves were more tactical than strategical but I didn't make any major blunders and capitalized on my opponent's mistakes. If you haven't tried it I recommend the Austrian attack as an opening that gives white chances to attack with Qe1 to h4 in a similar vein to a white side Dutch or where you can use extra space given by a strong center to slowly choke the life out of your opponent and finish them off at your pleasure. Just remember to hold everything together. 
1023,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Of course I start off with my usual.  Now I'm not sure how Stanley is going to respond since this is my first game with him.
1024,28,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',But after playing this which doesn't surprise me I stick with what I know by developing.
1025,28,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Once he continues developing this way I play my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez.
1026,28,3,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I was surprised to see this played.  I'm used to seeing black answer with the Berlin Defense being of course 3...Nf6.  But I have seen this played.
1027,28,4,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',With only about 20 minutes I forget about what I was taught.  That's because I just go for it by not thinking twice about exchanging.  In other words this is a time where I exchanged just because it was possible to do it.  Ken revealed that this isn't the way to go or think in our first lesson so it's worth noting that if I had more time I would've refused just as he did with me.  Instead of playing this I would've exchanged pawns instead with 4.Nxe5 and I know the drill being that black gets the pawn back with 4...Qe7  But without a lot of time I didn't want to play through it since I'm forced to retreat and thus lose tempo when time is of the essence.  So I figured by exchanging I was gaining that needed time to castle.  Of course getting reckless with exchanging could as we know become costly.  However I bear in mind that losing is going to help me learn so I'm not there to win knowing who I'm up against.  Contrary to the game with Ken if I spent too much thinking about it the game might have timed out.  Now if I had to pick between losing or not being able to finish the game I'd rather lose.  That's because I in general don't learn as much when there isn't time to finish the game.  
1028,28,5,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p7/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I was surprised to see Stanley hit my B but I do what must be done to defend.
1029,28,6,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/8/2BpP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',And Stanley waists no time to develop since there's now an open line for the Bc8.  As black I probably would've fianchetto'd with either 6...b6 or 6...g6 for a similar reason.  But like me after the game I discovered that Stanley is also under a similar time restraint since he also leaves very shortly after noon local time.
1030,28,7,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/8/2BpP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Likewise I open up a line for my Bc1.  But I only do it this way for the thrills and giggles of the pawn chain.  For if more time had allowed I would've given 7.b3 consideration and most likely would've played it.
1031,28,8,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/8/2BpP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Meanwhile Stanley continues with his develop as will I by pining the N.  And although it's Q side he'll break the pin in the way that we know since 8...Be7 will be played.  Yes this is what I would do to since that's what Jack taught me.  Though I'd take ...h6 into consideration since Ken told me that breaking it with the B isn't always the best way to break the pin mainly when it's Q side as this is where the pin occurs.
1032,28,9,Nd2,b'r1bqk2r/1pp1bppp/p2p1n2/6B1/2BpP3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"With that I play this just to complete my development.  I did consider 9.Na3 but didn't want to leave my N on the rim.  And for the obvious reason 9.Nc3?? isn't a feasibility so in order to develop the best option is to leave the N in a cramped position.  But intend to uncramp it soon since it's about finding a better place for the piece which I will.
"
1033,28,10,Be6,b'r2qk2r/1pp1bppp/p2pbn2/6B1/2BpP3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',But that's not before Stanley completes his development.  With that another exchange is forced.  If I had a choice I probably wouldn't have exchanged here but this is where I learned.  As I thought that with the pawn chain which is the main thing that I was thinking about I played 7.d3.  However I'm pretty sure now that best was 7.b3 as then I would've been able to retreat with 10.Be3 similar to what Ken played against me in our first game.  By advancing the d pawn the B is blocked so that an exchange is forced.  And yes were it not for a limited amount of time that's what I would've done.  But thinking about the time was in no doubt the right choice because when the game ended there was only about a minute or two before I had to go.  And after the coaching that I got with Stanley there was only about 5 seconds left so I was faced with a real time crunch here.
1034,28,11,1Nf3,b'r2qk2r/1pp1bppp/p2pbn2/6B1/2BpP3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Knowing that an exchange is forced here I bring the N to a better place at once keeping in mind that his d4 pawn is threatened as well.  So after exchanging Stanley protects with the obvious 11...c5.
1035,28,12,1Qd3,b'r2qk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2p3B1/2PpP3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',So my idea of a good time is connecting the Rooks.  And that is the sole reason for playing this move as nothing else comes into consideration here.  Part of it is the time crunch and it's worth noting that I've got 13 minutes now.
1036,28,13,1h6,b'r2qk2r/1p2bpp1/p2p1n1p/2p3B1/2PpP3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',I was surprised to see him hit my B.  So I retreat but in such a way that appears to put a little pressure on the d file.  That is my aim with 13.Bf4.
1037,28,14,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p1n1p/2p5/2PpPB2/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Sure enough my instinct was not completely off as this move does break the pressure.  As now the K side is more supported.
1038,28,15,1Rad1,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p1n1p/2p5/2PpPB2/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Not knowing what else to do I centralize my Rook.  But I also bear in mind that in general you want the Rook behind or in front of the Queen for coverage.  That's just a known fact as I've seen in a few chess problems.
1039,28,16,1Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p3p/2p5/2PpPBn1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I'm not sure what this move accomplishes.  But maybe he's trying to build an army against my K.  That's because what happens if he moved the N swings down with the B and then brings the Q down at some point.  Now I'd be faced with several attacking forces.
1040,28,17,1g3,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p3p/2p5/2PpPBn1/3Q1NP1/PPP2P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',So I figured that the best way to handle this situation is by opening up.
1041,28,18,1Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p2p1b1p/2p5/2PpPBn1/3Q1NP1/PPP2P1P/3R1RK1 w - -',Contrary to what happened before I just don't know why he played it.
1042,28,19,1Rfe1,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p2p1b1p/2p5/2PpPBn1/3Q1NP1/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 b - -',So I just figured that the response was to centralize the Rook.  And as you might imagine nothing else came into consideration aside from this move.  That's because of what I noted in one of charleshiggie's annotation on what move I'd play.  And it was this move after having one Rook centralized with the idea of doing with the other.  As I mentioned that's what I would've done which is exactly what happened here.  You should also know that there's now under 10 minutes so I wasn't going to spend time figuring out what else to do.  As noted if I lose I'll learn but there won't be as much learning if I can't finish the game.
1043,28,20,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p2p1b1p/2p1n3/2PpPB2/3Q1NP1/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 w - -',Planning to exchange.  But without giving it any though I just abide and for the same reason that I noted earlier.  As now there's only approximately give or take a minute only 6 minutes remaining.  So now everything is going by quickly.  However with more time I might have done that because I don't like the looks of 17.Nd2 where it would remain cramped and as we know I don't like the N confined to near my home-square (where it started) as that's what I consider a cramped position.
1044,28,21,1Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p4b1p/2p1p3/2PpP3/3Q2P1/PPPB1P1P/3RR1K1 b - -',But taking back with the pawn forces this move as the idea is that if I lose I play my best.  That still means figuring out how to accurately defend without giving things away if it can be avoided.
1045,28,22,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/1p1q1pp1/p4b1p/2p1p3/2PpP3/3Q2P1/PPPB1P1P/3RR1K1 w - -',Mobilizing his Rooks as they're now connected.

1047,28,24,2Ba5,b'r4rk1/1p1qbpp1/p6p/B1p1p3/2PpP3/Q5P1/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 b - -',As that makes room for this move as I felt that Stanley is now faced with some pressure.  This isn't so but I was analyzing just one variation where that could happen but that variation was at most 30 seconds as I now have less then 5 minutes.
1048,28,25,2f5,b'r4rk1/1p1qb1p1/p6p/B1p1pp2/2PpP3/Q5P1/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 w - f6',I'm not sure why but Stanley wants to exchange pawns.  Figuring that it might need to an attack on the K I willingly do it.  As nothing else comes into consideration.  And as noted similar to what we saw in my previous but strictly because of the time crunch I exchange just because it's possible to do so.  As before I said less then 5 minutes but now there's only about 3 minutes.  So for the last few moves I've been talking about the speed of blitz chess.  But now it's in the fastest form that you could imagine.  As otherwise I would've held off.  Knowing that exchange is inevitable I would've let him take first.  But not knowing what else to play I take first.
1049,28,26,2Ref1,b'r4rk1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p1pq2/2Pp4/Q5P1/PPP2P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',"? The only downside is that Stanley now has a threat against my K side.  It starts to become overwhelming.  So with only 2 minutes I only look for a good move which is this.  With more time though I would've remembered what's important which is something that Ken emphasized in the form of a chess quote.  ""When you find a good move look for something better.""  Unfortunately there's no time to look now but had there been I would've played 22.f4 and would've been ready to exchange in order to prevent what's about to come.  This my first mistake because as I'm about to discover it's going to lose a pawn without compensation."
1050,28,27,2b3,b'r4rk1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p1p3/2Pp4/QP4P1/P1q2P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',?? This was played to protect my c pawn and with the pawn chain as per that obsession.  And I'm focused on attacking the Q side without anything coming into consideration whatsoever.  But as Stanley implied when he coached me this is the losing blunder.  Just like with my game against bhidragon my Queen is out of play.  Therefore it won't be able to bring it back to the K side where it's needed.  It turns out that Stanley's attack was on the K side which should've been my focus.  In particular it was against my monarch where he has attacking forces against it.  By playing this first I'm going to lose the equivalent to another piece for two pawns after we exchange and then he takes back.  But more importantly those attacking forces are gonna prove to be overwhelming as it'll become overwhelming especially since I can't use my Q to protect.  So just like that game I missed the big picture as I'll explain at the end of this game. 
1051,28,28,e4,b'r5k1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p5/2Ppp3/QP4P1/P4RKP/3q4 w - -',Advancing a pawn.  At first I thought that he was only trying to promote since that is a passed pawn.  But it's worse then that since this along with his d4 pawn are also some of the attacking forces against my King.  And that's along with his Queen and Rook which is what I mean by overwhelming. 
1052,28,29,2Rf4,b'r5k1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p5/2PppR2/QP4P1/P5KP/3q4 b - -',Still feeling that he's only trying to promote I figured that this move will prevent it.  That's because I anticipate his next move in which 27.Re4 is the conditional move to try and block.  But 27...Qe2+ is where I figure out that there's more to it then meets the eye.  As that's where I start to figure out what he's really up to similar to what I saw with bhidragon.
1053,28,30,2Kh3,b'r5k1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p5/2PpR3/QP2p1PK/P3q2P/8 b - -',Seeing the attacking forces I try to put a stop to it with this move.  That's because if I went back to the first rank Stanley's next move would be ...Rf8 after which ...Qf1# will come in which there will be no way to prevent.  But with this move I felt that I could hold off a little but was wrong.  As 28...Rf8 will be played anyway.  And then it's about what to come.
1054,28,31,2g4,b'5rk1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p5/2PpR1P1/QP2p2K/P3q2P/8 b - -',Figuring that I could still hold off this is what I played.  The conditional move was 29...Rf2 in which I'd try to defend with 30.g5  But I overlooked the next move which was mate.  After he mated he coached me.  But one of the things that he told me was that taking the B with 29.Rxe7 was also an option but he'd still mate.  Then Stanley asked me if I wanted him to show me how and I said yes as that is another way for me to learn.  This is because I thought that if I had just taken there's the chance that I might be safe but had doubts.  This showed that the variation shows that the doubts I had were correct.  For after 29.Rxe7 Stanley's move would've been 29...Rf2  From there it is mate on the next move no matter what I do as 30...Rxh2# inevitable.  Similar to the game against bhidragon and ION where I resigned the King is pinned.  And in order to avoid mate it would have to move.  It's not possible in this position because of all the attacking forces he has against me.
1055,28,32,2Qf3#,b'5rk1/1p2b1p1/p6p/B1p5/2PpR1P1/QP2pq1K/P6P/8 w - -',Overall Stanley said that I played extremely well.  But the moral of the story is based on what he told which matches with what bhidragon also said in my game against where I focused on developing the Nb1 but missed the bigger picture.  This is where Stanley explained why 23.b3?? was the losing blunder.  My fixation as noted was on the pawn chain as well as attacking on the Q side.  But the real focus should've been on the other side of the board being K side as that's where all of the action occurred; as he had the buildup of attacking forces which were used to mate me.  Therefore the lesson to be learned is to see the overall picture (entire story) that the board is revealing.  In other words to see everything that's going on in that position in order to understand what it demands.

So having drawn with Robert Akeya-Price after we had looked at our game I asked him how he beat Thomas Villiers and he showed me."
1057,29,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So it starts as a Queen's Gambit.
1058,29,2,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"Robert turns it into a Catalan Opening - quite an unusual choice for one so young!

1059,29,3,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black takes the pawn. Of course Robert could immediately regain the pawn with 5. Qa4+ but he is in no hurry and calmly continues with his development.
1060,29,4,Qa4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/Q1pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',And now Robert plans to recapture the pawn.
1061,29,5,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3n4/Q1pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This is slightly unusual. I tend to think that black should continue with his development.
1062,29,6,Qxc4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3n4/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',So white gets the pawn back.
1063,29,7,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/n2n4/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Again - I can't help thinking that black should be getting on with his development rather than playing this.
1064,29,8,Qa4+,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/n2n4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Robert told me that he was expecting his opponent to play either Nc6 or c6.
1065,29,9,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/4p3/n2n4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This was a bit of a shock. Of course 9. Qxa5?? Bb4+ and black gets a queen for two pieces.
1066,29,10,Qd1,b'r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/4p3/n2n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But the queen is quite comfortable here.
1067,29,11,c5,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/n1pn4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq c6',Black does a thematic attack on the white centre.

1069,29,13,1Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n1pn4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black at last develops his Bf8.
1070,29,14,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n1pnN3/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Knight takes up a dominating square in the centre.

1074,29,18,1Qg4,b'r3k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2p3/n2nN3/6Q1/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',How many players facing an opponent graded 56 ECF grading points ahead of them would have taken off the queens? Quite a few I fancy! But Roberts took his time and played the strongest move. Black is in all sorts of trouble now as 14. Bxd5 is threatened and if black recaptures with the e pawn white can take the bishop on d7. Or white could play the moves in another order - 14. Nxd7 and if black plays Kxd7 then white has 15. Bxd5. Meanwhile white is also threatening 15. Qxg7.
1075,29,19,1Bb5,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/1q2p3/nb1nN3/6Q1/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',Black finds the best defence.

1077,29,21,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp2bpQp/1q2p3/nb1nN3/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Materially down black sacrifices again pinning everything on a king side counter-attack hoping to take advantage of white's undeveloped queen-side. I would expect that black realised that objectively Rf8 was the best move but 0-0-0 unbalances the position and has practical chances.
1078,29,22,1Nxf7,b'2kr3r/pp2bNQp/1q2p3/nb1n4/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',White correctly takes the offered material.

1081,29,25,1Rdf8,b'2k2rr1/pp2bN1Q/1q2p3/nb1n4/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',but both black's rooks now have nice open files against the white king.
1082,29,26,1Bxd5,b'2k2rr1/pp2bN1Q/1q2p3/nb1B4/8/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNB2RK1 b - -',Robert again plays the best move removing black's best placed piece.

1084,29,28,1Nh6,b'2k2rr1/pp2b2Q/1q5N/nb1p4/8/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNB2RK1 b - -',and now white is threatening both the Be7 and the Rg8.
1085,29,29,1Bc5,b'2k2rr1/pp5Q/1q5N/nbbp4/8/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNB2RK1 w - -',Once again black pins his hopes on counter-attack hoping to confuse his young opponent. Either 18.... Qe6 or 18.....Rh8 lose less material but offer little in the way of long-term chances.
1086,29,30,1Nxg8,b'2k2rN1/pp5Q/1q6/nbbp4/8/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNB2RK1 b - -',So white takes.

1088,29,32,2Bf4,b'2k2rN1/pp5Q/1q6/n1bp4/5B2/6P1/PP2bP1P/RN3RK1 b - -',Cool play from the youngster! Robert blocks the f file and prevents black's king from running to g8.
1089,29,33,2Bxf1,b'2k2rN1/pp5Q/1q6/n1bp4/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/RN3bK1 w - -',So white recaptures some material.
1090,29,34,2Kxf1,b'2k2rN1/pp5Q/1q6/n1bp4/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/RN3K2 b - -',White takes back.
1091,29,35,2Rxf4,b'2k3N1/pp5Q/1q6/n1bp4/5r2/6P1/PP3P1P/RN3K2 w - -',And black sacrifices yet again! Black correctly removes one of white's best placed pieces and damages white's king side pawn formation.
1092,29,36,2gxf4,b'2k3N1/pp5Q/1q6/n1bp4/5P2/8/PP3P1P/RN3K2 b - -',So white takes back.
1093,29,37,2Qxb2,b'2k3N1/pp5Q/8/n1bp4/5P2/8/Pq3P1P/RN3K2 w - -',Black is rook and pawn down but he is going to regain the rook on a1 surely?
1094,29,38,2Qf5+,b'2k3N1/pp6/8/n1bp1Q2/5P2/8/Pq3P1P/RN3K2 b - -',No! Robert has prepared a clever defence showing that not only can he attack he can also defend accurately.Now if Kd8 24. Qf6+ forces the queens off.
1095,29,39,2Kb8,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n1bp1Q2/5P2/8/Pq3P1P/RN3K2 w - -',So the black king went this way.
1096,29,40,2Qe5+,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n1bpQ3/5P2/8/Pq3P1P/RN3K2 b - -',and now this fork does the business!
1097,29,41,2Qxe5,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n1bpq3/5P2/8/P4P1P/RN3K2 w - -',So black is forced to trade queens.
1098,29,42,2fxe5,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n1bpP3/8/8/P4P1P/RN3K2 b - -',White takes back.
1099,29,43,2Bd4,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2pP3/3b4/8/P4P1P/RN3K2 w - -',But black is still winning the rook in the corner surely?
1100,29,44,2Nc3,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2pP3/3b4/2N5/P4P1P/R4K2 b - -',This wins - although 26. e6! was even stronger.
1101,29,45,2Bxc3,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2pP3/8/2b5/P4P1P/R4K2 w - -',So black took.
1102,29,46,2Rd1,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2pP3/8/2b5/P4P1P/3R1K2 b - -',White attacks the d pawn but again 27. e6! was even better.
1103,29,47,2Bxe5,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2pb3/8/8/P4P1P/3R1K2 w - -',Black is happy to exchange pawns - if he can trade all the pawns and the knights King & Bishop v King and Rook is usually a draw.
1104,29,48,2Rxd5,b'1k4N1/pp6/8/n2Rb3/8/8/P4P1P/5K2 b - -',White forks black's pieces.
1105,29,49,2Nc6,b'1k4N1/pp6/2n5/3Rb3/8/8/P4P1P/5K2 w - -',But black has a resource.
1106,29,50,2h4,b'1k4N1/pp6/2n5/3Rb3/7P/8/P4P2/5K2 b - h3',This is a powerful outside pawn.
1107,29,51,2Kc7,b'6N1/ppk5/2n5/3Rb3/7P/8/P4P2/5K2 w - -',King comes over - but he can't go far.

1109,29,53,3Bh8,b'6Nb/ppk5/2n5/3R3P/8/8/P4P2/5K2 w - -',So his opponent rushes to block it.
1110,29,54,3f4,b'6Nb/ppk5/2n5/3R3P/5P2/8/P7/5K2 b - f3',But Robert has a second ace up his sleeve!
1111,29,55,3Nb4,b'6Nb/ppk5/8/3R3P/1n3P2/8/P7/5K2 w - -',Black tries to fight back forking white's rook and a pawn.
1112,29,56,3Rd2,b'6Nb/ppk5/8/7P/1n3P2/8/P2R4/5K2 b - -',This protects both.
1113,29,57,3Bc3,b'6N1/ppk5/8/7P/1n3P2/2b5/P2R4/5K2 w - -',And now the rook is attacked again.
1114,29,58,3Re2,b'6N1/ppk5/8/7P/1n3P2/2b5/P3R3/5K2 b - -',Robert cleverly prevents the black king from coming across to block the passed pawns which threaten to advance.
1115,29,59,3Kd6,b'6N1/pp6/3k4/7P/1n3P2/2b5/P3R3/5K2 w - -',The king comes across one square anyway.

1190,30,72,3Rd6,b'6R1/2kb4/p2Rp2r/1pn1P3/1p2B1P1/7p/P4r2/7K b - -',This is the move which I think was a mistake.  White moves his rook to d6 and I think this should have been to pin the knight with a move to c1 instead.  The rook does nothing here it does not even protect the LB which was at threat and still is.
1191,30,73,3Nxe4,b'6R1/2kb4/p2Rp2r/1p2P3/1p2n1P1/7p/P4r2/7K w - -',So now black captures the LB with the knight.  White's other rook is at g8 and not able to protect the king.

His best move would have been to d3 and he would been able to interfere with the kinght at d4 trying to move to g3.  But white was thinking about bringing his rooks together to check the black king but it was too late for that.
1193,30,75,3h2,b'6R1/2kb4/R3p2r/1p2P3/1p2n1P1/8/P4r1p/7K w - -',Black pushes his pawn to h2 and the king at h1 is unable to move so this is not looking good.  There is a rook at f2 so cannot use the 2nd row to escape and the pawn stops him from going to g1.
1194,30,76,4Raa8,b'R5R1/2kb4/4p2r/1p2P3/1p2n1P1/8/P4r1p/7K b - -',Now black has decided it is urgent to give assistance and moves his rook to a8 perhaps to bring it over to the f file and make it more difficult for the f rook but I am not sure white had considered the harm from the knight at e4 since it is checkmate if the knight goes to g3.  The best move was a3 but this would only have been captured so really the game was over for white and resignation should have followed.
1195,30,77,4Ng3#,b'R5R1/2kb4/4p2r/1p2P3/1p4P1/6n1/P4r1p/7K w - -',With the last move from black of Ng3 the game is all over for white.  I think this was a good game for both sides but it seems white had the initiative with black's late development but probably black had the plan and white was attacking but did not maintain the initiative.  Definitely at the end white failed to see the whole picture and was busy attacking while his king was a risk.  I will try to keep this in mind by ensuring defence is maintained and pursue the attack on my opponent's king at the right time once my king is safe.

1241,33,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is Janet's favorite.  I know from experience because in a consultation game at Chicoboy's Legacy we were black against her.  And this was her first move.
1242,33,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Back in the day I expected the QG because I generally play 1...d5 and await 2.c4.  But the reason for not being surprised here is the discussion at Chicoboy's Legacy Club as well during that consultation game.  It's not a mistake but the most common move in the world database is what Charles played.  And as we discussed it normally doesn't matter.  But against opposition of this strength one small thing could lose the game.  So the idea is to not deviate from the mainlines here as discussed there.
1243,33,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Likewise Janet is I believe thinking along the same lines.  She develops and prepares for the Colle's System because this is played first.  And 3.e3 follows.
1244,33,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',All part of the mainlines since as GM Susan Polgar once noted black fianchettos in this opening.
1245,33,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',To my surprise Janet decides to not play the Colle's System afterall.  I say this because 3.e3 would've been my move.  But this being played takes me out of unfamiliar territory and thus better for learning purposes.  That's due to what I learned with Kenneth_fiore_3.  As the idea is trying to get more used to different openings.  The reason is because Ken play's openings that people say aren't good just like with TA.  So he plays that and wins because the opponent underestimates what appears to be weak or as Ken calls it frowned upon.  
1246,33,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The main follow up to the fianchetto as Charles has nice long flank.  And yes I would've played this for that exact reason.
1247,33,6,g3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Likewise Janet fianchettos.  And not to my surprise Charles will castle after which white will get nice flank as well.
1248,33,7,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ d6',And it gets interesting as Charles advances his center pawn.  In doing so an interesting exchange will occur.  Then Janet will use her opportunity to castle as well.
1249,33,8,Nb6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I was surprised to see this played though.  As black I would've been more aggressive by developing another piece with 7...Bg4  But this has to be a better outpost for his N.  Maybe Charles has plans to play ...Nc4 at some point.
1250,33,9,Nc3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Having had advanced the c pawn Janet continues with her development.  Believe it or not we're thinking along the same line because this is also what I would've played and for the same reason.
1251,33,10,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1nn3p1/8/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',But this move shocks me since Charles did not advance his c pawn after having had played 5...d5  Therefore just like his last annotation this is another exception that I'm trying to puzzle.  But I do know now.  I thought the plan was ...Nb4 because it looks somewhat similar to what he noted.  The real plan however is his 9th as it involves his N jumping which makes as this is where I think about what I learned from tactical-abyss about the N visualization count.  And what that boils down is where it travels and what roles they play and how this makes them powerful.
1252,33,11,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1nn3p1/3P4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',As this is played.  That's why the last move would've appeared to have been an inaccuracy.  But given that stronger players see things that people like me don't see I'm sure that Charles had planned this let alone see it.  As now it'll move.  And despite it being on the rim it'll be on a more powerful square as it appears.
1253,33,12,1Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/n2P4/8/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I am not sure why Janet played this.  But I know that there's something she wants to do with her Queen.  My guess is to mobilize and get it ready for action.  Of course I don't see it but there's got to be a complicated variation that would make it powerful.  I say this because I would've prepared for a discovered attack with 10.Bd2.  The one thing for sure is that Janet gives him that center pawn which Charles take.  From there it gets more interesting and more educational.
1254,33,13,1Rd1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/n2n4/8/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BR2K1 b - -',Of course.  As elyhim pointed out in one of his annotation which is a well known fact one of the things you want to do is centralize the Rook.  What's more is Charles Nd5 being pinned.  And the worst part is that there is no way to break it.  That is where we're seeing white's true colors from this perspective.  As now this pin also poses as direct threat.
1255,33,14,1c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/n2n4/8/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BR2K1 w - -',So as Charles has noted in his annotations he protects as well here.
1256,33,15,1Ne1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/n2n4/8/2N3P1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BRN1K1 b - -',I'm surprised to see Janet undevelops.  Since I generally don't see the point of undeveloping; combined with Ken's comment in Charles most recent annotation about a move that does it I understand here.  There is a more active and powerful square for the N.  I just don't which one for it to jump.  But time will tell.
1257,33,16,1Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2p3p1/n2n4/8/2N3P1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BRN1K1 w - -',Not to my surprise not only does this complete development.  But the main reason for playing it is because it breaks the pin.  So although Charles defended accurately Janet is going to win the pawn back not surprisingly as that sac appeared to be a gambit.  Though if that's true then just QG it wasn't a true gambit since white is going to get a pawn back. 
1258,33,17,e6,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/4p1p1/n2R4/8/6P1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B1N1K1 w - -',And with Charles hit's the Rook.  When Janet retreats black will attack the Queen afterwhich white will her Queen (put it directly behind the Rook) which is typical during the late phases of the midgame as well as the endgame.
1259,33,18,Rc7,b'3q1rk1/pprb1pbp/4p1p1/n7/8/3R2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQN1K1 w - -',I'm not sure why Charles played this.  But my guess was to make his Queen more mobile on the eighth rank.
1260,33,19,1Bf4,b'3q1rk1/pprb1pbp/4p1p1/n7/5B2/3R2P1/PP2PPBP/R2QN1K1 b - -',This is where Janet completes her development by launching a nasty attack on blacks Rook.  Not to my surprise Charles will defend by attacking the B.
1261,33,20,1Rc1,b'3q1rk1/pprb1pbp/6p1/n3p3/5B2/3R2P1/PP2PPBP/2RQN1K1 b - -',Although I would've retreated with 18.Be3 I am not surprised that Janet didn't so this.  That's because if 18...exf4 to make long story short black wins back the piece and places a lot of pressure with 19.Rxd7 as the threat also involves the Queen and if Charles took to defend it he'd lose a Rook without compensation.  So he'd naturally have to retreat the Queen but after which Janet would have more threats.   
1262,33,21,1Nc6,b'3q1rk1/pprb1pbp/2n3p1/4p3/5B2/3R2P1/PP2PPBP/2RQN1K1 w - -',As Janet was interested in exchanging Rooks.  So Charles declines that as he might need it later on as I learned with Ken about exchanging.  I see the logic behind it.  But white is ready to exchange by stripping off the N.  I can see why for afterwards black is faced with pressure.
1263,33,22,2Be3,b'3q1rk1/p1rb1pbp/2p3p1/4p3/8/3RB1P1/PP2PP1P/2RQN1K1 b - -',Afterwhich Janet protects her piece.  But there was a lot going there and hard to keep it up which is why I was trying to break it down from my own perspective back and forth.
1264,33,23,2Qc8,b'2q2rk1/p1rb1pbp/2p3p1/4p3/8/3RB1P1/PP2PP1P/2RQN1K1 w - -',Then comes this move as similar to white Charles has his Queen behind the Rook.  And seeing the position combined with both sides being like this I know that this is now an endgame and an interesting one at that.
1265,33,24,2Rd2,b'2q2rk1/p1rb1pbp/2p3p1/4p3/8/4B1P1/PP1RPP1P/2RQN1K1 b - -',At first I wasn't sure why this was played.  But seeing how it goes down combined with my second lesson with Ken this gives Janet's Ne1 more mobility which becomes apparent on her next move.
1266,33,25,2Be6,b'2q2rk1/p1r2pbp/2p1b1p1/4p3/8/4B1P1/PP1RPP1P/2RQN1K1 w - -',However I do not know why Charles played this.  As black I would've played 21...e4 to give black's Bg7 more mobility.
1267,33,26,2Nd3,b'2q2rk1/p1r2pbp/2p1b1p1/4p3/8/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/2RQ2K1 b - -',This was the plan behind 21.Rd2 since the Rook was in the same spot before that was played.
1268,33,27,2f5,b'2q2rk1/p1r3bp/2p1b1p1/4pp2/8/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/2RQ2K1 w - f6',I believe that Charles is aiming to attack the N but with a pawn chain since ...e4 at any point would do that in a position like this.
1269,33,28,2Qa4,b'2q2rk1/p1r3bp/2p1b1p1/4pp2/Q7/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/2R3K1 b - -',But this move however appears to stop that as Charles won't attack the N.  But I think that had something else been played he would have as that's how I think.  So I believe that the idea behind this move was attack black's Q side since the Queen appears to be better placed then earlier.
1270,33,29,2Bf7,b'2q2rk1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/4pp2/Q7/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/2R3K1 w - -',Just like before I have no idea why Charles played this as it appears to give his monarch less options.  For example he can't 24...Kf7 whereas it was possible earlier.  But there is as usual things in games like this that I don't understand when we reach a difficult position.
1271,33,30,2Rcd1,b'2q2rk1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/4pp2/Q7/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/3R2K1 b - -',But I'm not surprised to see Janet doubling up as that is a common and important theme in chess.
1272,33,31,2Rd8,b'2qr2k1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/4pp2/Q7/3NB1P1/PP1RPP1P/3R2K1 w - -',Charles responds by putting pressure on whites Nd5.  And with it seeing that is defended more then attacked.  With that my inference is that black speculates that he's lost but is attempting to get counterplay.  If my instincts are correct that is a good thing to fight for and shows that like his rival here Charles is also (as he said with penelope80) a tough cookie.
1273,33,32,2Nc5,b'2qr2k1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/2N1pp2/Q7/4B1P1/PP1RPP1P/3R2K1 b - -',The plan is a little more apparent since Janet's Nc5 is now on the same diagonal as her Be3.  White's target is Charle's a7 pawn.  The idea is to exchange Queens followed by attacking the Rc7 so that when black protects it she can grab a7 and win a pawn.  Or that's what Charles might have thought as I did to until white's next move.  But the real plan is to get the Queen by checking on d8.  And it must be admitted that I would've overlooked this to.  I was thinking along the same lines as Charles.
1274,33,33,2f4,b'2qr2k1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/2N1p3/Q4p2/4B1P1/PP1RPP1P/3R2K1 w - -',?? I believe that this was his only mistake.  But with stronger opposition as Tom told me it only takes one mistake.  That's because similar to my last game with easy19 moving the Rook off of the d file would've prevented what's to come.  And in that case I wreckon that black would still be in the game.  That's the only reason that I gave this move two quieries with stronger players.  As I felt that this game was drawish until this move.
1275,33,34,2Rd2xd8+,b'2qR2k1/p1r2bbp/2p3p1/2N1p3/Q4p2/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/3R2K1 b - -',But that's because with those doubled Rooks (which are known to be dangerous for reasons like this) Janet is going to win Charles Q.  And there is nothing that black can do about it.  Consequently he resigned.  Overall I absolutely enjoyed going through this game and do get what getoverit was telling me.  That's because along the way there is plenty to learn by watching players that are a lot longer and seeing how it's really done.

1391,38,14,1Be7,b'r1bqrnk1/pp2bpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/3P3B/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Rather an acknowledgement that his bishop would have been better developed to e7 in the first place. I tend to think that this move is a waste of a tempo and it would have been better for him to develop his Bc8.
1392,38,15,1Ne5,b'r1bqrnk1/pp2bpp1/2p2n1p/3pN3/3P3B/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',This is the logical reply putting the knight on an aggressive square.
1393,38,16,1Nh5,b'r1bqrnk1/pp2bpp1/2p4p/3pN2n/3P3B/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black is seeking to ease the pressure with exchanges but the knight is rather out on a limb here. After 13. Ne5 I can only find one game in my opening databases with this position http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=20476007&mv=24&rnd=0.006532949289570045 colo1889 (1907) vs. john_wr (1871). I have actually met John face to face! Anyway he chose Be6 instead and I think that move is better. Incidentally Gameknot post-game computer analysis doesn't give Be6 as a mistake suggesting it was a reasonable move maybe even the best. I was also looking at Ng4 for him with a similar idea of exchanging pieces.
1394,38,17,1Bxe7,b'r1bqrnk1/pp2Bpp1/2p4p/3pN2n/3P4/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',So I take his bishop. But really I am getting rid of his good bishop and my bad bishop.
1395,38,18,1Rxe7,b'r1bq1nk1/pp2rpp1/2p4p/3pN2n/3P4/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',I was rather expecting him to recapture with his queen.
1396,38,19,1f4,b'r1bq1nk1/pp2rpp1/2p4p/3pN2n/3P1P2/2NBP3/PPQ3PP/4RRK1 b - f3',So I anchor my knight to e5. 
1397,38,20,1Nf6,b'r1bq1nk1/pp2rpp1/2p2n1p/3pN3/3P1P2/2NBP3/PPQ3PP/4RRK1 w - -',He prepares to exchange my knight.
1398,38,21,1b4,b'r1bq1nk1/pp2rpp1/2p2n1p/3pN3/1P1P1P2/2NBP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 b - b3',and the long-awaited minority attack starts.
1399,38,22,1Nf6d7,b'r1bq1nk1/pp1nrpp1/2p4p/3pN3/1P1P1P2/2NBP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 w - -',He continues with his plan.
1400,38,23,1b5,b'r1bq1nk1/pp1nrpp1/2p4p/1P1pN3/3P1P2/2NBP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 b - -',and me with mine.
1401,38,24,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1nk1/pp2rpp1/2p4p/1P1pn3/3P1P2/2NBP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 w - -',He takes.

1406,38,29,2Na4,b'r2q1nk1/p2brpp1/2p4p/3pP3/N2P4/3BP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Heading for c5
1407,38,30,2Rc8,b'2rq1nk1/p2brpp1/2p4p/3pP3/N2P4/3BP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 w - -',Not quite sure of the point of this move.
1408,38,31,2Nc5,b'2rq1nk1/p2brpp1/2p4p/2NpP3/3P4/3BP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Knight hops in.
1409,38,32,2Ne6,b'2rq2k1/p2brpp1/2p1n2p/2NpP3/3P4/3BP3/P1Q3PP/4RRK1 w - -',He challenges my knight.

1411,38,34,2Nxc5,b'2rq2k1/p2brpp1/2p4p/2npP3/3P4/3BP3/P1Q3PP/1R3RK1 w - -',He takes.
1412,38,35,2Qxc5,b'2rq2k1/p2brpp1/2p4p/2QpP3/3P4/3BP3/P5PP/1R3RK1 b - -',I take back attacking h7.
1413,38,36,2Be8,b'2rqb1k1/p3rpp1/2p4p/2QpP3/3P4/3BP3/P5PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Again very passive! Be6 looks better.
1414,38,37,2Ba6,b'2rqb1k1/p3rpp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/4P3/P5PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Of course he would love to play Rb8 but it just loses a rook - I exchange rooks and then take his rook on e7.
1415,38,38,2Rcc7,b'3qb1k1/p1r1rpp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/4P3/P5PP/1R3RK1 w - -',So he moves it here instead.
1416,38,39,2Rb3,b'3qb1k1/p1r1rpp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/1R2P3/P5PP/5RK1 b - -',Preparing to double rooks on the b file and invade on b8. Black can't stop this. I also protect e3 just in case he tries to break with f6.
1417,38,40,2Red7,b'3qb1k1/p1rr1pp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/1R2P3/P5PP/5RK1 w - -',He has a plan to exchange queens.
1418,38,41,2Rfb1,b'3qb1k1/p1rr1pp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/1R2P3/P5PP/1R4K1 b - -',I double.

1420,38,43,2Rb3b8,b'1R2b1k1/p1rrqpp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/4P3/P5PP/1R4K1 b - -',"So the rook finally reaches b8. Now if he takes my queen I have a zwischenzug - I take his bishop with check before recapturing the queen and end up a bishop up. The zwischenzug (German: pronounced [ˈtsvɪʃənˌtsuːk] ""intermediate move"") is a chess tactic in which a player instead of playing the expected move (commonly a recapture of the capturer of a piece that the opponent has just captured) first interposes another move posing an immediate threat that the opponent must answer then plays the expected move. This is a good example. "
1421,38,44,2Kf8,b'1R2bk2/p1rrqpp1/B1p4p/2QpP3/3P4/4P3/P5PP/1R4K1 w - -',But now he really is threatening to exchange queens.

1423,38,46,2g6,b'1R2bk2/p1rrqp2/B1p3pp/3pP3/3P4/4P3/P1Q3PP/1R4K1 w - -',He prevents this.
1424,38,47,2Rf1,b'1R2bk2/p1rrqp2/B1p3pp/3pP3/3P4/4P3/P1Q3PP/5RK1 b - -',"And now I have a pin on the f file so I am threatening Qxg6. In chess a pin is a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece. ""To pin"" refers to the action of the attacking piece inducing the pin and the defending piece so restricted is described as pinned. This is a good example. Were it was white's move now I could play Qxg6 and black can't take my queen with his pawn on f7 as he would be moving into check because of my Rf1."
1425,38,48,2Kg7,b'1R2b3/p1rrqpk1/B1p3pp/3pP3/3P4/4P3/P1Q3PP/5RK1 w - -',So he breaks the pin.
1426,38,49,3Qf2,b'1R2b3/p1rrqpk1/B1p3pp/3pP3/3P4/4P3/P4QPP/5RK1 b - -',More pressure on the f file. More importantly he can't play 30....Rd8 neutralising my rook as I have 31. Qf6+ where 31....Qxf6 is met by exf6+ and he loses the Rd8 31... Kf8 is met by Qh8# and Kg8 or h7 is met with me exchanging queens and winning the Rd8. 
1427,38,50,3Kf8,b'1R2bk2/p1rrqp2/B1p3pp/3pP3/3P4/4P3/P4QPP/5RK1 w - -',So he moves back again.
1428,38,51,3Bd3,b'1R2bk2/p1rrqp2/2p3pp/3pP3/3P4/3BP3/P4QPP/5RK1 b - -',I threaten Bxg6 now.
