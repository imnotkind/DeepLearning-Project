28,2,0,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',Lange begins with the Vienna Gambit.

37,2,9,2Nf5#,b'r4b1r/ppp1q3/2np3p/5N1b/3PP2k/4B2P/PPP3K1/8 b - -',Checkmate -- with the capped Knight.
38,3,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White opens with a fianchettoed bishop.  Black counters with an assertive opening to dominate the center.

41,3,3,d5,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn2n2/2ppp3/4P3/N1P3P1/PPQPNPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - d6',Pawn moves forward into the center.
42,3,4,Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn5/2pnp3/8/N1P3P1/PPQPNPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Here the knight moves into a vulnerable spot.  White can bring more pieces to bear on d5 and the only black piece backing it up is the queen.
43,3,5,1cxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn5/2pn4/3P4/N5P1/PPQ1NPBP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',The last two moves leading up to this capture are good moves by white.  White can now exert influence into the center without pawns in the way.
44,3,6,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn5/2pn4/3P4/N5P1/PPQ1NPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Instead of recapturing the d4 square black chose to provide support for the unprotected bishop on b7.
45,3,7,Bxc5,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pn5/2bn4/8/N5P1/PPQ1NPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',This was the move black was waiting for.  Black wanted the white pawn to take c5 so the bishop could recapture and pins a pawn near the white king.  This crucial move allows for the final attack later in the game.
46,3,8,1Rd1,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pn5/2bn4/8/N5P1/PPQ1NPBP/R1BR2K1 b - -',Yikes!  White has moved another piece to attack the center knight.
47,3,9,1Ncb4,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/2bn4/1n6/N5P1/PPQ1NPBP/R1BR2K1 w - -',In one move black provides two more supports for the center knight - and counterattacks white's queen.  Bonus: both of black's bishops have nearly unobstructed lines of attack into white's kingside corner.
48,3,10,1Qc4,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/2bn4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2NPBP/R1BR2K1 b - -',White's queen moves to provide another attack on black's center knight.
49,3,11,1Qf6,b'1r3rk1/pb3ppp/1p3q2/2bn4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2NPBP/R1BR2K1 w - -',Black's queen moves into position to take the hapless pawn.  This move takes one line of support off the center knight and effectively offers the knight as bait.
50,3,12,1Bxd5,b'1r3rk1/pb3ppp/1p3q2/2bB4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2NP1P/R1BR2K1 b - -',White takes the bait.
51,3,13,1Qxf2+,b'1r3rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/2bB4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2Nq1P/R1BR2K1 w - -',Black's queen takes the hapless pawn and makes her real intentions known.
52,3,14,1Kh1,b'1r3rk1/pb3ppp/1p6/2bB4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2Nq1P/R1BR3K b - -',White's only move is to go the corner where ...
53,3,15,1Bxd5+,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p6/2bb4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2Nq1P/R1BR3K w - -',Black puts him in check again.  White's king can't move so the only defense is to take the bishop by sacrificing a more valuable piece.
54,3,16,1Rxd5,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p6/2bR4/1nQ5/N5P1/PP2Nq1P/R1B4K b - -',This moves the rook off the backrow so it can no longer protect the king.
55,3,17,Qf1+,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p6/2bQ4/8/N5P1/PP2N2P/R1B2q1K w - -',The black queen moves into position for the final assault.
56,3,18,2Ng1,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p6/2bQ4/8/N5P1/PP5P/R1B2qNK b - -',Only possible move for white.
57,3,19,2Qxg1#,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/1p6/2bQ4/8/N5P1/PP5P/R1B3qK w - -',The black queen declares victory!
58,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was my final game in freddy's AP-III tourney and one in which I had been looking forward.  I always enjoy my games against joanne and this game was to decide second place in the tourney--somehow freddy had managed to eek out first place ;)  The thematic moves end around move 9.
59,4,1,Kb6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Black moves her King away from the fork with Nc3.  Of course the goal for Black is to now activate her pieces and protect her King while White seeks to cramp black and attack the exposed King.
60,4,2,1d3,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',10. d3?  I give this move a ? as I feel it is a mistake.  Every other game as White I have moved (as has most everyone else) 10. Nc3.  I could provide a number of excuses why I didn't do so but the fact was I was simply not paying attention and moved d3 one turn early.  As I told joanne at least this will insure we have few if any games to rely upon for study.
61,4,3,1e5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/1kp5/4p1N1/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ e6',10. e5  Black immediately sets about to free her pieces.  If she is able to do so her material advantage should lead to a win.

63,4,5,1Nd7,b'r2q1b1r/pp1n2pp/1kp5/4p1N1/4pPB1/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',11...Nd7  I think that Black was anticipating 12. Be3+ and was marshalling forces to cover c5.  And given that White has allowed e5 Black's Bishop is able to provide additional support (along with Rc8). 
64,4,6,1Ncxe4,b'r2q1b1r/pp1n2pp/1kp5/4p1N1/4NPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The N is now centralized but in hindsight moving 12. Be3 may have been better.  As after 12. Ncxe4 Black can move Nf6 forcing an exchange of Ns which must be good for Black.  Another line that seems good for Black is 12...Nf6  13. Be3+	  c5 14.Nxc5  Bxc5  15.Bxc5+ Kxc5  Although the Black King is exposed it's not clear how White can immediately take advantage of this.
65,4,7,1exf4,b'r2q1b1r/pp1n2pp/1kp5/6N1/4NpB1/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',12...exf4  I didn't like this move for Black as White is able to bring the DSB out while cutting off another escape route for the K.  White must also be careful not to move Ng5 until the K has castled otherwise Qh4+ could lose the Bishop.
66,4,8,a5,b'r2q1b1r/1p1n2pp/1kp5/p5N1/4NBB1/3P4/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ a6',Preparing to move the K to safety.
67,4,9,1O-O-O,b'r2q1b1r/1p1n2pp/1kp5/p5N1/4NBB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',I could see nothing better so I thought to continue development.  I didn't move 14. Nf7 and fork the Q/R as I didn't want to trade a somewhat active N for an inactive R.  At this point Black is not really developed and I'm hoping to keep it that way.
68,4,10,1Qe8,b'r3qb1r/1p1n2pp/1kp5/p5N1/4NBB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',Avoiding the potential fork of Q/R by N
69,4,11,1Rhe1,b'r3qb1r/1p1n2pp/1kp5/p5N1/4NBB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',Clearly threatening the Q.
70,4,12,1Rd8,b'3rqb1r/1p1n2pp/1kp5/p5N1/4NBB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',15. Rd8?  This move surprised me as it resulted in Black having to give up her Q.
71,4,13,1Nf6,b'3rqb1r/1p1n2pp/1kp2N2/p5N1/5BB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',"At this point the Queen only has one square where she is not immediately attacked but moving 16...Qg6 would be problematic for Black.  For example:  Qg6
17.	Nxd7+	Rxd7
18.	Bxd7	 and White is winning.  Another line might be 	Qg6
17.	Nxd7+	Ka6
18.	Re6	Qxe6
19.	Bxe6 which was also bad for Black."
72,4,14,1Nxf6,b'3rqb1r/1p4pp/1kp2n2/p5N1/5BB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',In my opinion this is Black's best option.
73,4,15,Rxe8,b'4rb1r/1p4pp/1kp2n2/p5N1/5BB1/3P4/PPP3PP/2KR4 w - -',At this point White clearly has the more active game.  The trick is to try and press this advantage.
74,4,16,2Ne5,b'4rr2/1p2b1pp/1kp2n2/p3N3/5B2/3P1B2/PPP3PP/2KR4 b - -',I'm bringing the N to c4 to try and concentrate the attack on the K.
75,4,17,2Bg3,b'4rr2/kp2b1pp/2p5/p2n4/2N5/3P1BB1/PPP3PP/2KR4 b - -',I really wanted to keep my B-pair.

77,4,19,2d4,b'4rr2/1k2n1pp/1pp5/p3N1b1/2PP4/5BB1/PP4PP/1K1R4 b - -',Here I thought to continue grabbing space and I also saw the possibility of exploiting my Q-side pawn majority.
78,4,20,2Bf4,b'4rr2/1k2n1pp/1pp5/p3N3/2PP1b2/5BB1/PP4PP/1K1R4 w - -',But I missed this move.  I did not want to exchange Bishops but if I moved by DSB away I would have lost h2.
79,4,21,2d5,b'4r3/1k2n1pp/1pp5/p2PN3/2P2r2/5B2/PP4PP/1K1R4 b - -',I had worked out the next few moves and as I calculated I was going to be left with a passed pawn on the 6th rank.
80,4,22,3Rd7,b'2k5/3R2pp/1pP5/p3r3/5r2/5B2/PP4PP/1K6 b - -',I think White's pieces are nicely coordinated at this point.  
81,4,23,3Rg5,b'2k5/3R2pp/1pP5/p5r1/5r2/5B2/PP4PP/1K6 w - -',Protecting g7.

86,4,28,3Ka8,b'k7/1R4pp/BpP5/p1r5/5r2/8/PP4PP/1K6 w - -',I would have been surprised if it actually happened but I saw no reason not to provide the opportunity for Black to err.

103,5,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',And I play my favourite Samisch system
104,5,5,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',Solid development by Black but c5 e5 and Nc6 are more common
105,5,6,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR w KQ c6',I put my trust in devlopment. I saw on the Gameknot World Database that Qd2 Nh3 and Nge2 are actually more common

Qd2 and I think he was afraid I would play Bh6 and exchange off his lovely dark squared bishop so he moved his rook so that he can drop his bishop back to h8 if necessary. However in some variations of the King's Indian the rook is better on f8 to support f7-f5.
108,5,9,e5,b'r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2p1p3/2PPP1P1/2NBBP2/PP1QN2P/R3K2R w KQ e6',So I decide to advance on the King side. His a6 rather put me off queen's side castling - he can sacrifice a pawn with b5 and get some open files against my king. I was thinking of putting my king on f2 - especially as he had moved his rook from f8.
109,5,10,Nb6,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pbp/pn1p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBP2/PP1QN2P/R3K2R w KQ -',His e5 took us out of the Opening Databases (not that either of us were using them at the time of course. With my king still in the centre I felt best to close the centre although I did consider exchanging pawns too. Nb6 looks a dreadful move. It blocks the advance of his b pawn. I think he wanted to give another square to his Nf6 (another downside of Re8 was that he now has less squares for that Knight.
110,5,11,Kh8,b'r1bqr2k/1p3pbp/pn1p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q3P/R3K2R w KQ -',Kh8 looks like a mistake too. Why put your king opposite my rook?

114,5,15,fxg6,b'r2qrb1k/1p5p/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P1b1/2NBB1N1/PP1Q4/R3K2R w KQ -',I exchange rather than let his block up the position.
115,5,16,Qd7,b'r3rb1k/1p1q3p/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P1b1/2N1B1N1/PP1QB3/R3K2R w KQ -',My Bd3 is not a good bishop blocked by my own pawns. I decide to exchange it. He correctly protects it with his queen. Maybe I should play Rh4 here but instead I decided to complete my development with....
116,5,17,Bxe2,b'r3rb1k/1p1q3p/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N1B1N1/PP1Qb3/2KR3R w - -',and he exchanges
117,5,18,Rac8,b'2r1rb1k/1p1q3p/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N1B1N1/PP2Q3/2KR3R w - -',I retake with the queen to protect the c pawn. I am not sure why he played Rac8

123,5,24,Bxh6,b'1r1q3k/1pr4p/pn1p2pb/2pPp3/2P1P3/1P2B1N1/P3Q3/2K2R1R w - -',He removes the knight which was threatening Nf7 winning more material

At the time I didn't think they worked and then a move or two later when it was too late I realised they did! See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=33318
126,5,27,Qg8,b'1r4qk/2rn3p/p2p2QR/1ppPp3/2P1P3/1P2B1N1/P7/2K2R2 w - -',But I am winning easily anyway

130,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I play the Colle-system long ago. This is passive but has poison if black makes a blunder.

Also I would like to add that this is one of the first tournament games I played after a few months of a chess-break and already in the one before I had blundered in a winning position. So maybe it has something to do with not enough practise or routine? The time control were 90min+30sec/move.

Also The knight has for now no squares left. In the next few moves however it does not take long until Black has fully equalized - might there have been something better here?

White is going to start an attack on the kingside so maybe an immediate 15.g4 with the idea of 16.Ng3 17.Nf5 and if Bxf5 then gxf would have been stronger? Also I am not quite sure whether Ne3 might have been better for I could have still played g4. What made me refrain from Ne3 was the Bc1 which to mee looked rather dull but I know that Ne3 is quite common in Spanish games and what made me not play g4 was simply that I did not think of it. Does anyone know which one of the mentioned moves would have been the strongest?

Again I am not sure. I was thinking for quite a long time here wondering what White wanted to achieve and it all amounted in either a g-pawn-push which would have meant I needed to put my knight somewhere else or a knight on f5. I could however not think of any possibility to achieve the latter; 16.Nh4? Nxe4! and Nf3-h2-f1-e3 takes too long. I could not find anything better and yet to me this move seems somewhat dubious - the white pawn structure gets really messed up. So are there any suggestions of what White's best options would have been? "

However it does make the g5-push somewhat more difficult for if I allow the queen to take on f5 there is one more mighty defender. I think the intention of Qd7 was to enable the knight to go back to b7 after which Black can play ...a5. 
281,14,11,Nb7,b'r4rk1/1n1qbpp1/p2p3p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1R1P1/2P2N1P/P4P2/R1BQ2K1 w - -',After this move I thought quite a while whether or not to play 23.a4 trying to stall Black on the Queenside. I have been told some times that one should not make pawn moves on the wrong side of the board meaning the board where one is not attacking but after 23...a5 24.axb5 axb4 25.Rxa8 Rxa8 26.Rxc4 (or 26.cxb4 ?) I thought that Black is lacking the pawns he needs to really scare me. However I did not like the idea of 26...Ra1 where I would have to spend some time freeing myself from all the pins. I guess Ba3 would be worth a closer inspection too. However I thought that attacking myself would give me more chances - can this in some way be true or did White need to defend at this point?

And still I am not sure whether Black ought to have played ...Qd8 (...f6 would of course have prevented g5 too but it just seems ugly to me. Even though I cannot see an immediate way of taking advantage of that for I would need to break through all the pawns first. Also the bishop would be really restricted. Or would ...f6 in fact have been working in order to stop the white attack?)

The reasons to sacrifice a piece was that a) I figured I had to attack as soon as possible otherwise the black pawns could be menacing; b) as far as I could tell the sacrifice is sound. I was at the time being aware that I might not be able to calculate all the variations without mistake but if there is a flaw in the sacrifice I might just as well let my opponent show it to me.

Game after game we saw the same crystal-clear method of play based on two actions:  the first designed to balk or neutralize Black's counterplay on one wing and the second launching an attack on the king at a moment when the other sectors of the board have been stabilized.  In the process we learnt that the central defensive wall is not as durable as it looks.  It is immobile and rarely enables Black to create effective counterplay and it did not protect him against wing attacks.  Even worse the pawn-wall itself sometimes became the target of the undermining moves b4 and f4.

I'm not usually a Ruy Lopez player (from either the white or black side) however there were some idea variations and pet lines that I wanted to experiment with so I christened a seven-man tournament.

Black moves his only developed piece allowing it to be snapped off.  Frowned upon by classicists but as with many offbeat lines it does contain subtle poison.  I played against one Bird Ruy Lopez before and thought I had a good game since my opponent had isolated double center d-pawns but my game crumbled grotesquely by move 20 when I tried to exploit them and unwittingly sprung my opponent's pieces (and two bishops) to life.

704,32,3,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',I believe 7 ... Nd7 is played more often here. White usually castles then and than black plays 8 ... c5. I actually think playing c5 on this turn is better than the next turn since I haven't  castled yet and there is no knight obstructing Black's queen.
705,32,4,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bBP4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Necessary. Black can now exchange on c3 reinforcing my centre or take my pawn on d4 agreeing to a pawn structure with my pawns on c3 and b4. Retreating to a5 is also a good option not yet agreeing on anything and leaving me to figure out how to hold the centre.
706,32,5,1Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/2p1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I thought long about this move. As I said before I believe this position is more common with the moves 0-0 and Nd7 included. Now if I play 10. bxc3 he'll probably play 10 ... Qxd1 and I lose castling rights as well as hopes of an attack. Loss of castling rights might not be that bad with the queens off but I rather have my king out of the centre. (Although in the game my king never leaves e1!) I could initiate an exchange of queens myself but I didn't feel comfortable that way. So I decided on this move sacrificing a pawn but letting my dark-squared bishop into play via b2. Note that both my bishops and queen are aiming at the Black's king castled position.

Black is probably trying to achieve counterplay along the c-file but that takes to much time. Black is acting like his king is perfectly safe. Or he thought that after 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 25. Bxh7+ loses because my rook on a1 is attacked and that I therefore do not have the time to retreat my bishop leaving it vulnerable to entrapment.

If the move is intended solely to prevent the Nimzo it seems a waste of time since 3.

Nevertheless a much rarer choice than Nf3; BCO2 does not consider it at all."
