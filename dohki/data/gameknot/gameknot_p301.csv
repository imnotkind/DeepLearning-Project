This is not a standard annotation it is just Fritz's analysis of variations copied and pasted (my brief comments are those not in parenthesis).  At the beginning of every relevant move a number is given by Fritz which indicates who is winning in terms of pawns positive for white and negative for black. It is only intended to allow Luckpawn and I to have a look at our game and see where we went wrong tactically - so if you could refrain from giving it a bad rating then that would be great thanks.  ;) The threshold for blunders was set at 1 pawn (i.e moves that lose the equivalent of 1 or more pawns have variations suggested).

slap in the face--but calm down dear reader; after all you cannot

fault until now no one has opened your eyes and ears.) Wait just a
little while and there will pass before you a miracle of
overprotection of more than earthly beauty. (I assume that I rightly
surmise that you are quite familiar with my great theory of
overprotection.)

such words as ""power"" and ""strength""; in the first place such banal
expressions make us uncomfortable; and in the second place we
like even less the brutalizing tendency which such words imply.)

Wherein lies the beauty of 3 e5? Why is this move so strong?

The answer is as simple as it is astonishing. The move is strong
because it is weak! Weak that is only in the traditional sense! In
reality that is to say it is not the move but the Pawn on K5 that is
weak--a tremendous difference! In former times it is true it was
customary to reject any move which created a weakness. Today
thanks to me this view is obsolete. For look my dear reader the
fact that the Pawn on e5 is weak obliges White to protect the Pawn
more and more until at last the state of overprotection arises as it
were of itself. But as we have seen (cf. My System)
overprotection is practically equivalent to victory. Hence it follows
automatically that the ""weak"" move 3 e5 is a certain road to
triumph. The rest is more or less a matter of technique.

provoke c5 and then play d4 rather than the other way round
which is the customary course. For if White first plays d4 there
follows c5 and White's d-pawn is under attack. But my clever
transposition of moves changes the situation completely. For now
Black's c-pawn is suddenly attacked by White's d-pawn!

The end result will be that Black will lose his knight on h1 but will have three healthy pawns and a solid position to offset his piece deficit. 

Also worth considering were 12 g3 or 12 g4 to play for Bg2 and the quick capture of Black’s cornered knight. But in that case Black would boast of 3 pawn and a rook vs two pieces - a very favorable material count for the second player.

White removes the rook from the long square diagonal and positions it on the c-file where it can help defend the c-pawn and where it will be come active if the c-file is ever opened.  Typically white's other rook goes to d1.
302,12,20,1Qa5,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/q5B1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/2R1K2R w K -',Notice how the queen can still influence the center even when developed to the side of the board.  From a5 she can help control e5 for example.  She is also clearing the way for the f-rook to transfer to the queenside.

It is a long tough tournament -- grueling some might say -- especially for a guy like me who's sitting at the rung just above the floor on the wallchart. Some people play well at the beginning and burn out towards the end while others just get warmed up with early losses and play better as the tournament progresses.  Luckily for me I happened to be in the latter category for the 2004 Interservice. 

Just coming off my first win in this event I was pretty psyched up but Major Cerezo would certainly give me a major headache if I slipped up so I knew I had to be on my toes for this game. SSgt Chris Brashers had some of the Major's games in his database and I knew he liked to play the Sicilian so I opted for the Grand Prix Attack an opening that seems to fit my style of play. Playing aggressively had been working for me so I thought I'd continue this trend and keep the pressure up from the git-go. 

This was the best game I played at this tournament and one I'm very proud of because I was uncharacteristically able to really see the board and come up with a plan I followed throughout the game that led to my getting another point for the Navy team.

Consider the final position again.  Almost all of the black pieces were crammed into the 4*4 corner on the queen side with no immediate plans to return to the king's side.  The only defender remained was the rook.  In this game black had castled to the wrong side and ended up with his king defenceless as his other pieces were tied to the queenside while white's attacking pieces demolished black defence.  Thanks for the nice game fenril!"
436,17,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Un coup inhabituel mais probablement jouable.

Je me suis demandé dans cette position si les blancs n'auraient pas fait mieux de continuer leur développement différemment vu que les cases noires des noirs sont un peu faibles. Ce coup permet aux noirs soit d'échanger les fous sur cases noires soit de forcer les blancs à retraiter le fou. Il est souvent plus profitable de laisser en suspens une faiblesse adversaire (ici les cases noires) pour l'exploiter plus tard que de tenter de l'exploiter tout de suite lorsqu'on n'en retire pas d'avantage immédiat. À part cette subtilité le coup blanc est correct.
438,17,2,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/p3np1p/6p1/1Npp4/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Les blancs conservent un léger avantage. Pourquoi? Ils ont une pièce de plus de développée les pions noirs au centre pourraient constituer une cible le pion g des noirs est avancé (mais les fous sur cases noires sont partis donc c'est moins grave) les pions blancs sont plus compacts. Tous de légers avantages mais qui démontrent que les blancs ont bien réussi leur ouverture.
439,17,3,1Qd2,b'rn1q1rk1/p3np1p/6p1/1Npp4/8/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Rien à redire sur les derniers coups. Les blancs continuent d'avoir un léger avantage.
440,17,4,Nbc6,b'r2q1rk1/4np1p/p1n3p1/2pp4/8/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Une petite réflexion-question ici. Pourquoi ce coup serait-il meilleur que e4 par exemple? Parce que ce coup développe une pièce qui protège l'autre cavalier en plus permet de libérer la tour. e4 sera toujours possible si les blancs jouent leur tour en d1 bien que les blancs pourront placer leur cavalier en e5 où il est plus menaçant.
441,17,5,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/4np1p/p1n3p1/2pp4/8/P1N2N2/1PPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Meilleur était R(a1)d1. Ceci force l'avance du pion noir. Bien que ce ne soit pas nécessairement mauvais pour les noirs les deux pions noirs du centre peuvent constituer une cible plus tard (avec le danger de se retrouver avec un pion isolé). Le pion b2 devient maintenant une cible pour les noirs.
442,17,6,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/4np1p/p1n3p1/2pp4/8/P1N2N2/1PPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Attaque le pion maintenant faible en b2.

444,17,8,1h6,b'1r1qr1k1/4np2/p1n3pp/2pp2N1/8/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Avec ce coup les noirs font perdre du temps aux blancs puisque le cavalier doit reculer. Mais les noirs vont aussi perdre du temps puisque le roi devra venir protéger le pion h6. La question est de savoir si la structure des pions devant le roi noir sera meilleure pour autant. Je crois que oui parce que la faiblesse sur les cases noires devant le roi n'existe plus et le roi noir a plus d'espace pour manoeuvrer. D'un autre côté. il faut faire attention de ne pas trop avancer le roi et ses pions en avant parce le roi peut devenir plus facile à attaquer notamment par les pions en avant du roi blanc. Donc je crois que la manoeuvre du cavalier commencée au 17ème coup par les blancs est erronée.
445,17,9,1Rfe1,b'1r1qr3/4npk1/p1n3pp/2pp4/8/P1N2N2/1PPQ1PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',Correct! Mais valait-il mieux mettre cette tour en d1 et forcer le pion d5 à avancer ? ... La réponse suit...

462,17,26,4Kg7,b'8/6k1/R6p/2p2pp1/1rN5/8/5P1P/6K1 w - -',Le roi noir est relégué au fond mais le pion c est toujours vivant. Il y a toujours de l'espoir pour les noirs.

527,20,25,2f3,b'3rr1k1/pp5p/n1p1p1pn/7q/2N5/5P2/PRPN2PP/3KR3 b - -',and with this move the game is almost over
528,20,26,2Qxh2,b'3rr1k1/pp5p/n1p1p1pn/8/2N5/5P2/PRPN2Pq/3KR3 w - -',My queen on the rampage
529,20,27,2Rxb7,b'3rr1k1/pR5p/n1p1p1pn/8/2N5/5P2/P1PN2Pq/3KR3 b - -',It looks to white like the same game is on at the other end..but its not really
530,20,28,2Rda8,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1p1p1pn/8/2N5/5P2/P1PN2Pq/3KR3 w - -',my two castles prevent major damage
531,20,29,2Nd6,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/8/5P2/P1PN2Pq/3KR3 b - -',his knight presents a small problem - I need teh pawns out of the way so I opt for the pawn while the knight might have been the better choice
532,20,30,2Qxg2,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/8/5P2/P1PN2q1/3KR3 w - -',this opens him up
533,20,31,2Nd2e4,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/4N3/5P2/P1P3q1/3KR3 b - -',and he helps me by doing so himself
534,20,32,2Qxf3+,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/4N3/5q2/P1P5/3KR3 w - -',I am points ahead now and the game is not in doubt
535,20,33,2Re2,b'r3r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/4N3/5q2/P1P1R3/3K4 b - -',not a bad move really
536,20,34,2Rab8,b'1r2r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/4N3/5q2/P1P1R3/3K4 w - -',so lets see what he is made of
537,20,35,2Nd2,b'1r2r1k1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/8/5q2/P1PNR3/3K4 b - -',this move I do not understand.. I think he saw shadows in the closet
538,20,36,2Qf8,b'1r2rqk1/pR5p/n1pNp1pn/8/8/8/P1PNR3/3K4 w - -',so now white has to choose - a knight or a castle...
539,20,37,2Rxa7,b'1r2rqk1/R6p/n1pNp1pn/8/8/8/P1PNR3/3K4 b - -',naturally he chooses the castle
540,20,38,2Qxd6,b'1r2r1k1/R6p/n1pqp1pn/8/8/8/P1PNR3/3K4 w - -',so I capture the knight
541,20,39,2Rh2,b'1r2r1k1/R6p/n1pqp1pn/8/8/8/P1PN3R/3K4 b - -',a fair attack on my knight but from a position of weakness
542,20,40,2Qxh2,b'1r2r1k1/R6p/n1p1p1pn/8/8/8/P1PN3q/3K4 w - -',especially since he made a HUGE blunder
543,20,41,3Ne4,b'1r2r1k1/R6p/n1p1p1pn/8/4N3/8/P1P4q/3K4 b - -',well the game is over and white has not resigned yet
544,20,42,3Red8+,b'1r1r2k1/R6p/n1p1p1pn/8/4N3/8/P1P4q/3K4 w - -',so it is forced
545,20,43,Rb1#,b'3r2k1/R6p/n1p1p1pn/8/4N3/8/P1P4q/1r2K3 w - -',Mate
546,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"Hello guys and girls this is my first notation. 

Well a classic move by white."
547,21,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I have a different opening compared to the chess engines soon you will see what I mean. Even though my first move is alike.
548,21,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Not what I expected but it doesn't blows me off. Sending it unprotected?
549,21,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I won't go and try to attack it. Stick to the opening plus he can easilly protect it.
550,21,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Having the knight at c3 is a great move since you have two pawns at line four.Plus nothing is attacking the pawns
551,21,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Having the bishop there is a good play since it can attack what is attacking it and no knight is able to attact it due to the pawns around it.
552,21,6,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Adding defence to the piece in the lead helps you have control of your territory.
553,21,7,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Moving the knight away for castling is a great way to let them know your king is not easy to capture. Moving it at f6 is a bad ideal because it blocks the bisops attack. At h6 is also good but I don't like to extend my territory attacks.
554,21,8,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',White is building a wall which helps him control more of his territory. He now protected his c4 too.
555,21,9,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Aha you thought I was going to castle but the king is not close to  danger or under attact so there is no need to castle so soon.
556,21,10,Be2,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',He is getting ready to castle so it won't get in the way later.
557,21,11,Bb7,b'rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I have to have my second tower but the real castles has four but when your facing one wall you see two towers.
558,21,12,e5,b'rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/4P3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',He is trying to block my bishop's attack.

561,21,15,dxe5,b'rn1qk2r/pbp1npbp/1p2p1p1/4p3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',MY TERRITORY!   >:O

563,21,17,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pbp1npbp/1p2p1p1/4N3/2PP4/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I can't use a pawn to move him away except for f7 but castling just seems better.Since I'm being attack.
564,21,18,1Bf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pbp1npbp/1p2p1p1/4N3/2PP4/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',With this attack he has force me to either block or attack.

566,21,20,1Bf4,b'rn1q1rk1/pb2npbp/1pp1p1p1/4N3/2PP1B2/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He is adding defece to his lead piece so he can have more moves.
567,21,21,1Nf5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pp1p1p1/4Nn2/2PP1B2/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I need to get my horses to attack not defend. Nb8 will not do me any good in a6 or d7(it would just give him the lead in it). So I went with Kf5 to be able to attack in his defend.
568,21,22,1d5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pp1p1p1/3PNn2/2P2B2/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A nice move other wise he would be a pawn short or the kings defend out of place if he defended the pawn with the bishop.
569,21,23,1exd5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pp3p1/3pNn2/2P2B2/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I can't let the pawn get too close to the other side or he will push harder to get it there.
570,21,24,1cxd5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pp3p1/3PNn2/5B2/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',It's force attack to keep the score even.

573,21,27,1Bxd5,b'rn1q1rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/3bNn2/5B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I had no other choice.
574,21,28,1Qxd5,b'rn1q1rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/3QNn2/5B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He is still controlling my attacks my targeting my rook.
575,21,29,1Qxd5,b'rn3rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/3qNn2/5B2/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',You can't spare a rook unless your going to win and its far from over.
576,21,30,1Nxd5,b'rn3rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/3NNn2/5B2/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',As you can see he has gain control of the territory but atleast he has no pawns nearby.
577,21,31,1Na6,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/np4p1/3NNn2/5B2/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I have to let my rook out and Na6 is my safest way. In c6 or d7 he would have gotten a free knight.
578,21,32,1Rab1,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/np4p1/3NNn2/5B2/8/PP3PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',He is getting his advancing his pawns without worring abou my bishop.
579,21,33,1Nc5,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/2nNNn2/5B2/8/PP3PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I can't let it advance.
580,21,34,1b4,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/2nNNn2/1P3B2/8/P4PPP/1R3RK1 b - b3',Darn they are able to move two spaces the first move ; ). 
581,21,35,1Ne6,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p2n1p1/3NNn2/1P3B2/8/P4PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I need to move it and Ne6 is the best move for it. Ne4 would only get it trap . Plus I need the bishop to stop protecting Ne5.
582,21,36,1g3,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p2n1p1/3NNn2/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 b - -',He calls for reinforcements.
583,21,37,1g5,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p2n3/3NNnp1/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 w - -',This will force it to move since my pawn is aslo protected.
584,21,38,2Nd7,b'r4rk1/p2N1pbp/1p2n3/3N1np1/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 b - -',He goes for my rook in order to save his knight and his bisop.
585,21,39,2Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/p2N1pbp/1p2n3/3N1np1/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 w - -',His Nd7 is attack in any direction.
586,21,40,2Nd7f6+,b'r2r2k1/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1np1/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 b - -',Brilliant by getting me in check. Even if I attack him he will still get me in check.
587,21,41,2Kh8,b'r2r3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1np1/1P3B2/6P1/P4P1P/1R3RK1 w - -',In this direction he will not be able to attack my h7 and get away from it.
588,21,42,2Bc1,b'r2r3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1np1/1P6/6P1/P4P1P/1RB2RK1 b - -',He had to retreat.
589,21,43,2Rac8,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1np1/1P6/6P1/P4P1P/1RB2RK1 w - -',My rook wouldn't do me any good stuck in the corner so I need to let him out.
590,21,44,2f4,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1np1/1P3P2/6P1/P6P/1RB2RK1 b - f3',He is aiming to defend his Knight with his rook and bisop.
591,21,45,2g4,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1n2/1P3Pp1/6P1/P6P/1RB2RK1 w - -',This is not checkers you don't have to eat if you don't want to.
592,21,46,2Bb2,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p2nN2/3N1n2/1P3Pp1/6P1/PB5P/1R3RK1 b - -',So he finds another way to do it.
593,21,47,2Ned4,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3N1n2/1P1n1Pp1/6P1/PB5P/1R3RK1 w - -',I had to block another defence of his since with his knight he has my king corner and at the same time getting to his king.
594,21,48,2Rbd1,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3N1n2/1P1n1Pp1/6P1/PB5P/3R1RK1 b - -',Without his bishop protecting it he is loosing communication so he needs to solve it.
595,21,49,2Nf3+,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3N1n2/1P3Pp1/5nP1/PB5P/3R1RK1 w - -',He will not risk his rook for my knight.
596,21,50,2Kh1,b'2rr3k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3N1n2/1P3Pp1/5nP1/PB5P/3R1R1K b - -',He chose to get corner.
597,21,51,2Rxd5,b'2r4k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3r1n2/1P3Pp1/5nP1/PB5P/3R1R1K w - -',This is my first mistake. I should have move Rc2 and get it over with but instead I decided to play around. I wanted to take his rook with my knight. In which I would have succeded if I would have paid more attention.
598,21,52,2Rxd5,b'2r4k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3R1n2/1P3Pp1/5nP1/PB5P/5R1K b - -',I was hoping he move Kd5 instead but once again I didn't paid enough attention. So a word from advice don't move under pressure just because you want to get it over with. Every move changes a strategy.
599,21,53,2Ne3,b'2r4k/p4pbp/1p3N2/3R4/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/PB5P/5R1K w - -',My second mistake I still had a chance to bring my rook to c2.
600,21,54,2Rh5,b'2r4k/p4pbp/1p3N2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/PB5P/5R1K b - -',A great move by him making me decide to either take his rook and loose the game or let his rook go and keep playing. Also with this my Rc2 is not effective anymore.
601,21,55,2Bxf6,b'2r4k/p4p1p/1p3b2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/PB5P/5R1K w - -',I hasitated and made my third mistake I should have moved h1-h2.
602,21,56,2Bxf6+,b'2r4k/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/P6P/5R1K b - -',He made an obvious move and a nice one with the situation.
603,21,57,2Kg8,b'2r3k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/P6P/5R1K w - -',My only move.
604,21,58,3Rb1,b'2r3k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/P6P/1R5K b - -',This is his best move for his rook away from danger and not cornered.
605,21,59,3Rc2,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/4nnP1/P1r4P/1R5K w - -',It's kind of late now but I can still checkmate him if I can get his rook away from line one.
606,21,60,3a3,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/P3nnP1/2r4P/1R5K b - -',He is saving his pieces from my rook.

608,21,62,3Rc1,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/P3nnP1/5r1P/2R4K b - -',A good move on his part by just having to move one more time and get it over with.
609,21,63,3Rc2,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/P3nnP1/2r4P/2R4K w - -',My last mistake and my fatal one too. I should have though it thru and move Kc2. Then my other knight to e1 and finish him off with Rf1 but hesitation and not putting your head straight is one of your worste moves.
610,21,64,3Rxc2,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/P3nnP1/2R4P/7K b - -',He has found another way to checkmate me.
611,21,65,3Nxc2,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/7R/1P3Pp1/P4nP1/2n4P/7K w - -',A rook for a rook.
612,21,66,3Rd5,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p3B2/3R4/1P3Pp1/P4nP1/2n4P/7K b - -',He puts in plan of what the other rook supposed to have done.
613,21,67,3h6,b'6k1/p4p2/1p3B1p/3R4/1P3Pp1/P4nP1/2n4P/7K w - -',I can now move him to give me more time to end it in a draw or stall him.
614,21,68,3Rd8+,b'3R2k1/p4p2/1p3B1p/8/1P3Pp1/P4nP1/2n4P/7K b - -',Two move checkmate and there is nothing I can do.

616,21,70,3f5,b'3R4/p4p1k/1p3B1p/5P2/1P4p1/P4nP1/2n4P/7K b - -',One move checkmate as you can see its unprotected and its a awsome play. Not all great plays mean that the piece is protected.
617,21,71,3Nxa3,b'3R4/p4p1k/1p3B1p/5P2/1P4p1/n4nP1/7P/7K w - -',Why not try and make the score even I'm going to loose anyway.
618,21,72,3Rh8#,b'7R/p4p1k/1p3B1p/5P2/1P4p1/n4nP1/7P/7K b - -',He moves h8 and takes the win. I started to annotate this game without knowing the outcome. Most people write about how great they play and won the game. You learn more about loosing and I wasn't going to delete this annotation just because I lost. Every move needs an explanation and you will have an answer if you know what you are doing. ADIOS! I hope you guys enjoy and learn like I did this game.

Having played Bob only once (and that almost two years ago) I really wasn't sure what opening he played so I asked a friend of mine what I should expect. Knowing my penchant for king-pawn openings he told me Bob was fan of the French. This put me at ease a little since I've had good results against the French in past tournament play but then before I could finish my thought my friend added ""I think he's even written a book or two about it."" Great. I knew I was in for a battle but I was determined to make the best move against my formidable opponent who isn't just one of the biggest chess proprietors in the nation but also has a knowledge of opening theory that puts the little experience I have to shame.

I have a healthy respect playing against computers and I knew that CM9k would be a very worthy opponent.

After some discussion with the CM9k team it was decided to play the match online at the Internet ""chessclub.com"". The time control would be brisk but manageable. I was not likely to face severe panic inducing time scrambles that inevitably lead to gross errors.

A large crowd of online kibitzers and spectators were drawn to the bout. I was probably a slight favorite going into the match but with humans there is the well … human factor!  

Just one stupid little move could cost me the game and match. Fatigue eye strain psychology etc. all play a prominent role in human chess and I had to steel myself to try and play like a machine. I went into the match with guarded optimism.

Playing against a program like Chessmaster 9000 is not a walk in the park. CM9k is absolutely merciless punishing errors is annoyingly patient and has a perfect memory for openings and endgames. Computers almost never blunder tactically although they can make major strategic errors.  

It was this strategic deficiency that I wanted to exploit vs CM9k. I hoped to steer our battles to quiet maneuvering trench warfare that requires judgment and foresight rather than brute calculating ability.

Black is clearly better now for the following reasons.  First his pawn structure is iron-clad. White cannot dent that compact chain of pawns. Second Black can attack two weaknesses on Whites’s side of the board. The d4 pawn is isolated and weak and White’s queenside survivors are also vulnerable.

Black's plan is to use his a-pawn as a battering-ram to soften up the white queenside and create a new weakness. Generally speaking one can defend with only one weakness. However two weaknesses are usually fatal."

If I decide to keep my bishop I've moved that piece twice gave him back the tempo he just wasted moving his knight.  Here I decided that if he takes next move I can capture back with the f-pawn and get strong control of the center.  Also he will have moved the knight 3 times to capture a bishop that moved once.

Because the king cannot capture the queen his rook had to take smothering the king.  This is particularly attractive because it is also a royal fork and black is -11 (and down the two bishops) a decisive disadvantage unless of course the opponent is mated.

I don't ever play 1...e5 but in order to learn about more chess positions I decided to join some different thematic tournaments.  If you are looking for an interesting dynamic approach for White I highly recommend that you study the Scotch Gambit.

And also 2.c3 doesn't block in the queen's bishop as in 2.e3.
966,35,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move stops White's e4 central boost. I also could've stopped it with 2...d5 going into a Slav (d4 d5 c4 c6) game with reversed colors.

I must be careful not to overextend my kingside pawns because if I play 14...f5? then my pinned e-pawn will be weaker and the white minor pieces will have access to a lot of weak squares on my third rank.
982,35,19,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/1bq1nppp/1pn5/p1p1p3/2P1N3/P2BPNB1/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I was desperate to create some kind of imbalance here and I was afraid of White's minor pieces if I castled kingside. Castling queenside is risky especially when you have overextended queenside pawns but I needed some kind of imbalance if I wanted to stay alive in this game. White's pieces are clearly more active and better placed.

If I play 21...Rxf5 then White plays 22.Nxb6  and if I have to play 22...Kd8 allowing 23.Qd3  picking up my rook because if I play 22...Kb8 then 23.Ned7  is almost mate and I have to sacrifice my queen.

A common strategy in Maroczy positions is to get a knight on the strong outpost d5. If White plays e5 at some point during the game I can simply move the rook to the h-file to strengthen my ensuing attack.

J'avais décidé de prendre le pion (avec le pion évidemment) et à la dernière minute je me suis dit : Et si je prenais avec le cavalier ce serait la même chose. Et de prendre sans réflléchir. Conclusion : il faut toujours bien réfléchir avant de jouer (c'est comme une vérité de La Palice mais c'est vrai). Habituellement je fais le vide sur mes réflexions avant de jouer question de vérifier s'il n'y a pas quelque chose d'évident que j'ai manqué. Mais visiblement je ne l'ai pas fait sur ce coup.
1031,36,2,1Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1n3p1/3N4/3Nn3/4B3/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Évidemment! Mon adversaire avait abandonné quelques jours auparavant dans une autre partie aussitôt qu'il allait perdre une pièce (pas vrai Nicolas ?). Je me suis dit que je le chicanerais pour son manque de ténacité. Donc pas question que j'abandonne.
1032,36,3,1Nxc6,b'r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/p1N3p1/3q4/4n3/3QB3/PPP1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Tout à coup il jouerait QxQ ?
1033,36,4,1Bf3,b'r1b2rk1/4ppbp/p1pn2p1/3q4/8/Q3BB2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Les fous blancs sont très bien placés donc il y a peut-être de l'espoir.
1034,36,5,1Qb5,b'r1b2rk1/4ppbp/p1pn2p1/1q6/8/Q3BB2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Excellent. Comment continuer? Les blancs doivent tenter de garder une certaine pression.
1035,36,6,1c3,b'r1b2rk1/4ppbp/p1pn2p1/1q6/8/Q1P1BB2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Pas beaucoup de choix.
1036,36,7,1Bf5,b'r4rk1/4ppbp/p1pn2p1/1q3b2/8/Q1P1BB2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Ici je ne comprends pas pourquoi les noirs ne jouent pas Nc4. Le pion e7 n'est pas très important en vue de l'échange d'un des fous blancs et la possibilité de sortir une tour avec gain de tempo.
1037,36,8,1b3,b'r4rk1/4ppbp/p1pn2p1/1q3b2/8/QPP1BB2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Un coup qui ne m'a presque pas pris de temps de réflexion. Dans une position de désavantage l'activité des pièces blanches est ce qui compte le plus. Donc tant pis pour le pion c.
1038,36,9,1Bxc3,b'r4rk1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/1q3b2/8/QPb1BB2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Les noirs auraient-ils été mieux de ne pas prendre? Mai après tout un pion est un pion.
1039,36,10,Bb4,b'r4rk1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/1q3b2/1b6/QP2BB2/P4PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Le problème avec ce coup c'est qu'il permet aux blancs de placer sa dame à un endroit plus favorable.

1041,36,12,Ba5,b'r1r3k1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/bq3b2/8/PP2BB2/1Q3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Ba3 était meilleur en raison de ce qui suit.
1042,36,13,Qxf1+,b'r1r3k1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/b1R2b2/8/PP2BB2/1Q3PPP/5qK1 w - -',Ici ma première réflexion fut : mon adversaire perd les pédales. Pourquoi sacrifier sa dame pour une tour. Bien sur il perd une pièce autrement mais n'est-ce pas mieux qu'une tour pour la dame? Mais j'ai changé de réflexion plus tard.
1043,36,14,2Kxe2,b'r1r3k1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/b1R5/8/PP2B3/1Q2KPPP/8 b - -',Personnellement j'aurais tenté de conserver les deux fous avec les blancs mais c'est une considération purement théorique.
1044,36,15,Bxe3,b'r1r3k1/4pp1p/p1pn2p1/4R3/8/PP2b3/1Q2KPPP/8 w - -',Ici encore il me semble que les noirs auraient du éviter les échanges. Mais ça aussi. c'est de la théorie.
1045,36,16,2g4,b'r5k1/2r1pp1p/p1pn2p1/8/6P1/PP2R3/1Q2KP1P/8 b - g3',Pourquoi avancer ce pion? Dans ce type de fin de partie si on peut parler de fin de partie déjà l'avantage de la dame est sa mobilité et sa capacité d'attaquer le roi adverse de tous bords et tous côtés. Mais pour cela il faut que le roi adverse soit attaquable de tous bords et tous côtés. Il faut donc le débusquer de dans son petit coin tranquille.
1046,36,17,2Rac8,b'2r3k1/2r1pp1p/p1pn2p1/8/6P1/PP2R3/1Q2KP1P/8 w - -',Ici (encore la satanée théorie) je ne comprenais pas la stratégie de mon adversaire. Les tours appartiennent sur les colonnes ouvertes. Ici mon adversaire semble faire fi de ce principe. Je me dis : victoire facile à l'horizon.
1047,36,18,2Qd2,b'2r3k1/2r1pp1p/p1pn2p1/8/6P1/PP2R3/3QKP1P/8 b - -',Mais plus je regarde la position plus la victoire semble difficile. Finalement toute la stratégie des noirs me semble pas si mauvaise. Et tant pis pour la théorie. Mais je suis encore confiant de l'emporter. Ce coup fait partie de mon plan de débusquage.
1048,36,19,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/2r1pp1p/p1pn2p1/8/6P1/PP2R3/3QKP1P/8 w - -',Oups! Changement de plan. Je craignais au plus haut point c5 la suite logique il me semble des derniers coups noirs. Je crois toujours que c'est le coup qui aurait pu sauver les noirs puisqu'il permet aux tours noirs d'entrer avec force dans le jeu. Surtout que le coup précédent devient une perte de temps. Le temps est important aux échecs.

1055,36,26,3Qd2,b'3r2k1/3r3p/p1pn1pp1/4p3/6P1/PP1R4/3QKP1P/8 b - -',De retour au centre. Ma stratégie est d'échanger une paire de tours. Dans cette position il sera impossible pour les noirs de l'empêcher. Dame contre tour et cavalier avec le roi noir maintenant plus vulnérable et la victoire est possible.
1056,36,27,3Kf7,b'3r4/3r1k1p/p1pn1pp1/4p3/6P1/PP1R4/3QKP1P/8 w - -',Va dans le sens du plan des blancs mais il est difficile de suggérer un meilleur coup. Si les noirs ne font rien pour éviter un échange de tours les pions blanc vont continuer d'avancer de côté roi et le débusquage va continuer.
1057,36,28,3g5,b'3r4/3r1k1p/p1pn1pp1/4p1P1/8/PP1R4/3QKP1P/8 b - -',Toujours dans le suite du plan.
1058,36,29,3f5,b'3r4/3r1k1p/p1pn2p1/4ppP1/8/PP1R4/3QKP1P/8 w - -',Je crois que c'est le meilleur coup.
1059,36,30,e4,b'3r4/3r1k1p/p1pn2p1/5pP1/4pP2/PP1R4/3QK2P/8 w - -',Ici par contre les noirs auraient du prendre le pion. Mais c'est plus une intuition plus qu'une certitude.
1060,36,31,Ke8,b'3rk3/3r3p/p1pn2p1/5pP1/3RpP2/PP6/3QK2P/8 w - -',Tentative louable de pouvoir jouer ensuite Nc4 et éviter l'échange de tours.
1061,36,32,3Qa5,b'3rk3/3r3p/p1pn2p1/Q4pP1/3RpP2/PP6/4K2P/8 b - -',Easy does it! (Pardonnez le changement de langue mais c'est ce que je me suis dit).
1062,36,33,3Nb5,b'3rk3/3r3p/p1p3p1/Qn3pP1/3RpP2/PP6/4K2P/8 w - -',Aussi bien crever l'abcès se disent les noirs. Nc4 ne fonctionne pas (RxN tout simplement et la dame peut se sacrifier pour les 2 tours noires).
1063,36,34,3a4,b'4k3/3r3p/p1p3p1/Qn3pP1/P3pP2/1P6/4K2P/8 b - -',Le coup clé qui justifie le 35ème coup des blancs. Le noirs vont devoir donner échec avec le cavalier en d4 au lieu de c3 (si la dame blanche avait pris le pion). Le cavalier en d4 bloque la tour et malgré les apparences ne pourra pas prendre le pion en b3.
1064,36,35,Nxb3,b'4k3/3r3p/p1p3p1/Q4pP1/P3pP2/1n6/5K1P/8 w - -',Non!!! J'ai bien dit que le cavalier ne pouvait pas prendre le pion.

1067,36,38,4e3+,b'8/7Q/p1pk2p1/5pP1/P4P2/3rp3/5K1P/8 w - -',J'attendais plutôt Rf3  mais la partie est tout de même terminée.
1068,36,39,4Qxg6+,b'8/8/p1pk2Q1/5pP1/P4P2/r3p3/4K2P/8 b - -',On peut retenir deux leçons de cette partie (à part le fait de réfléchir avant de jouer et de ne pas abandonner trop tôt) : Il ne faut pas toujours se fier à la théorie (le sacrifice de la dame noire n'était pas si bête); les coups de tour des noirs sur la colonne c auraient pu les sauver s'ils avaient continué avec la poussée du pion. À part ça c'est tout de même un bon exemple de ce que la dame peut faire contre tour et pièce mineure. La dame va habituellement l'emporter grâce à sa mobilité et avec l'aide du roi adverse si celui-ci est vulnérable.
1069,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is what passes for my opening repertoire. Not very original huh? I like this game because although I gave up a large advantage I gained early. I finished with a very pretty forced mate.
