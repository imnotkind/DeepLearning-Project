34,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"As White I've always preferred the closed and semi-closed openings. Closed openings start with 1. d4 d5. Semi-closed ones start with 1.d4 and black responds with some move other than 1. ... d5. The Open Game is 1.e4 e5 a Semi-Open Game (such as this one we played) is 1.e4 where black makes moves other than 1...e5. Flank openings 1.c4 1.Nf3 1.f4 can easily transpose into closed or semi-closed (or sometimes open or semi-open).
***********************************************************************
So I like closed and semi-closed. You on the other hand are playing for the Open Game or Semi-Open Game. Which one depends on my response.
***********************************************************************

None of these categories are better or worse for Black or White. They are more only a matter of preference. "
35,2,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"So when my opponent has White and plays 1.e4 I prefer the Semi-Open game. I play the French Defense (1...e6) the Pirc Defense (pronounced ""peerts"" not ""perk"" 1...d6) or Alekhine's Defense (1...Nf6).

***********************************************************************

You should study one opening at a time for at least a year and get really good at it. Then move on to study another opening. Currently for this 12 month period (starting early July) I am studying through the French so I only respond to 1.e4 with 1...e6.

***********************************************************************

Key Principle: Study one opening at a time for at least a year until you know it in and out. This does not mean you don't continue to learn other openings but that your primary focus is on only one."
36,2,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"So Chase one reason I like the openings I mentioned (the French Defense the Pirc Defense and Alekhine's Defense) is that in each one Black willingly allows White to establish an imposing pawn center with intention of attacking and destroying that center! So it's an intense debate between the 2 sides a debate won not with words but in tactical chess moves.

***********************************************************************

White says ""My solid pawn center will restrict your pieces giving me a superior position!"" Black says ""Your pawns are weak! I'll use my pawns to destroy your weak pawn center! I will undermine those overly advanced pawns and trade them off and gain a free open position!"" 

***********************************************************************

If White succeeds in keeping this ""strong"" pawn center he will definitely have the better game. Yet if black accomplishes his goal of undermining and / or trading off White's pawns in my opinion he will probably gain equality and if White is not careful Black can gain a strong advantage.

***********************************************************************

On the other hand in the French Defense Black willingly accepts a restricted LSB and possibly a restricted King-side. The French is fairly popular though so obviously many people agree with me that the tactical battle which ensues makes these ""minor inconveniences"" worthwhile."
37,2,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"With this move I begin to contend for the center and oppose your pawns. There are several primary responses frequently played: The main line is 3.Nc3. Black can continue with the following variations:

Rubinstein Variation 3...dxe4;
Winawer Variation 3...Bb4;
Classical Variation 3...Nf6;

***********************************************************************
If White chooses not to play 3.Nc3 he can instead play the Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5; the Advance Variation 3.e5; the Tarrasch Variation 3.Nd2.

The Advance Variation is the most aggressive blocking in Black's LSB. Black then starts an assault on the pawns via c5 and possibly (after more preparation) f6."
38,2,4,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"So you chose to play the Exchange Variation: 3.exd5. Although it is sound it lacks the intense battle or complications of some of the other variations mentioned above. Exchanging pawns on d5 removes the tension that is frequently part of this defense. Therefore it is usually avoided by most advanced players. For this same reason though it's probably the best line for beginners playing White against the French Defense. Until a player learns how to make in depth calculations complications should be avoided.

An interesting note after the pawns are exchanged the pawn structure and overall position looks nothing like the French Defense although it still is the French!"
39,2,5,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3...Qxd5(?) would give White unwarranted initiative with moves like 4.Nc3 or 4.c4. It would also leave Black without a pawn presence in the center. Thus 3...exd5.
40,2,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Good move developing towards the center. The knights are usually best on c3 & f3 or for Black c6 & f6. It's also good usually to bring the knights out before the bishops as you are doing.
41,2,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Ditto for me.

43,2,9,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So the reason the knights should be out first is that you usually don't know where the bishops should be placed. If your position is such that you know where they should go and you have a specific reason for bringing them out then bring them out. In this case I wanted to prevent you from pinning my king-knight with Bg5.
44,2,10,Bf4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Since Bg5 would not be a pin I agree this is the better move. Your bishop covers more squares on f4 than g5.

***********************************************************************

So you had one piece defending the d4 pawn (White Move 8). I pinned that piece(Black Move 8) so you add extra defense to the pawn (White Move 9). So I redirect my attack to the Bishop which defends the pawn (Black Move 9). 

***********************************************************************

Now you have a pawn defending the bishop and a knight defending but the knight is pinned so not really. So you play 10.h3(?). I need to do something with the bishop since you attack him. So I use him to remove the defending knight. After your queen captures your only defense to the bishop is the pawn while I have my bishop and knight attacking him. So I exchange on the e5 square winning a pawn."

55,2,21,1Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pn3/3P4/2NB1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',I normally prefer my bishops over knights. This is because while knights are the stronger piece in cramped closed positions bishops are stronger in open positions. So you have to consider each game individually but generally as pieces get traded off closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up the bishops become stronger and stronger. So although both pieces are technically the same value the bishops are my piece of choice. That may be just a personal thing though because while most strong chess players agree with me I've met some who disagree. So here I take your bishop with my knight instead of my bishop.

58,2,24,1Rad1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pb3/8/2NB1Q1P/PPP2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',So my advantage is now my pawn on d5. You prepare to harass my pawn by putting your rook on the file. In addition in doing this you also brought your rook to the center to a semi open file (which would be completely open if you win that pawn). Rooks are better in the center than they are on the edge on the board. They are best on open files 2nd best on semi open files and least effective on closed files.
59,2,25,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pb3/8/2NB1Q1P/PPP2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',So I solidify his stronghold! In addition I am putting my pawns on light colored squares. This is because we have opposite color bishops; you have a LSB I have a DSB. So in putting my pawns on light squares I give my bishop more freedom and restrict your bishop. This move also opens another line of attack for my queen along the d8 a5 diagonal. At this point I am considering Qb6 to attack the Pawn on b2 or Qa5 to bolster the bishops attack on your knight. I am also considering Bc7 followed by Qd6 to attack your king.

Yet now since I was seeing mate in the near future (though not yet worked out in detail) I did not want to trade queens. I was sure she would be helpful in the mate process. Currently your king has no squares he can move to. Yet since I plan to capture the f-pawn with my knight the king will have g3 as escape hatch. Soooo...

I guess I'll stick to that simple and logical first move for quite the rest of my life though the Bird (1. f4) or even crazy openings like the Orangutan (1. b4!?) or the Grob attack (1. g4!?) are pretty interesting too and could be great surprise weapons at least in Blitz."
110,4,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The passive but sound French defence consisting of tons of theory. The usual continuation here is the logical 2. d4 d5 when White has already at least four common choices to proceed (Main Line 3. Nc3 Advance Variation 3. e5 Tarrasch Variation 3. Nd2 Exchange Variation 3. exd5). Ignoring the logical central pawn move I was really looking forward to the rest of the game at this point because it was the first time I could use a rare Anti-French opening weapon in tournament play. It's called the...
111,4,2,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',... Reti-Gambit! Well it's not a gambit at this point as there are still all pawns alive but the usual continuation leads White to the possibility of sacrificing a pawn.
112,4,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Challenging the center quite a logic move in regards of the previous 1... e6.
113,4,4,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White ignores his attacked central pawn and just proceeds with quick development. You can see that the bishop is quite strong on this place here already eyeing g7.
114,4,5,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/4p3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black accepts the gambit (a healthy decision however like in all gambits you have to be careful) now the fun begins!
115,4,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/4p3/1PN5/PBPP1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Another development move which immediately attacks the lost pawn.
116,4,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/4p3/1PN5/PBPP1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black gets his first minor piece out and defends the won pawn.
117,4,8,Qe2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/4p3/1PN5/PBPPQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',The fight against the e4 pawn continues. This move might look odd because it blocks the bishop but a central idea in the Reti Gambit is queen-side castling for occupying the d-file and the light-squared bishop can simply be developed via g2 or h3 afterwards.
118,4,9,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1b2p3/1PN5/PBPPQPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black develops and obviously plans to kill one attacker of the e4 square to hold the gambit pawn.

It can never hurt to place a rook on the same file than the opponent's queen ;-) Notice that winning back the pawn via 6. Nxe4?? fails due to 6... Nxe4 7. Qxe4 Qxd2 mate.
120,4,11,Bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/4p3/1Pb5/PBPPQPPP/2KR1BNR w kq -',?! I was very surprised by this move and consider it as weak because it allows White to open up the d-file and gives away the pair of bishops. It's primary the opponents greed about holding this won pawn which motivates this move I guess.
121,4,12,dxc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/4p3/1PP5/PBP1QPPP/2KR1BNR b kq -',Doubled pawns and the temporary blocked dark-squared bishop are the price for the mighty open d-file.

124,4,15,h6,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1qpp1/4pn1p/8/4p1P1/1PP5/PBP1QP1P/2KR1BNR w kq -',The opponent already seems to fear the pawn advance because it would leave the pawn on e4 undefended.

This game was played between my master buddy Freddy the Master Mater and a Class C player called Concordborn (Matthew).  This game certainly belongs under the It Can Be Done thread.  OK it was a draw and not a win although in the middlegame Matthew had great winning chances being a piece ahead but alas allowed Freddy back into the game by getting his knight trapped.  Matthew did get a pawn for the knight and ended up in a same coloured bishop ending where he remained a pawn up right until the end.  However because Freddy had put his king right up into his opponent's arc Matthew had to be content with a Master Draw - at least it took him only 3 attempts to get there as opposed to my 50!  Anyhow gameknot analysis is right here:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14233842&rnd=0.8639711164224122"

Bc6 and DRAW OFFER - Freddy accepts the draw offer as there is no way through the gate - Freddy has been stonewalled and must now concede a Low Draw although for him it could have been far far worse.  Anyhow hope you all have a good read and you Walk the Walkers take heart from this - it is possible to achieve something other than a big fat zero against The Master Mater!

If dxe6 the white bishop can take b7 threatening my rook and e6 can take f7 giving check and weakening my king's position. On the other side my bishop is threatening the rook f1 and the knight is approaching to a fork on c2. Normally those forks are bad because I will lose two pieces for a rook. BUT I had the feeling (I couldn't calculate it) that the knight will survive: look after he takes the rook e1 (it will be there if he tries to save it) the queen would have taken the bishop and I will be able to play NxBf3 with check so no danger...

I would have played dxe6 leaving me the decision to be greedy (BxRf1) or try to save the day with fxe6. This one is bad since white throws in Bh5+ and my king goes dangerously out in the worst possible way no matter BxR or Nc2 winning another rook I will probably be lost. But he behaves... good boy!

385,17,3,Ng5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Inviting ...Nf6 to protect the lead e-pawn.  White is aiming for a line I have dubbed the 'Demolition Derby' Attack:  4...Nf6  5.Bc4!? (apparently allowing Black to win White's Queen) ...Bg4  6.Bxf7ch Kd7  7.Qxg4 Nxg4  8.Be6ch ... 9.Bxg4.  For the Queen White gets active play and Black has difficulty just developing.  The jury is still out on the soundness of this ultra-violent line.  (I wonder if  'A Clockwork Orange' Attack wouldn't be a better appellation?  Maybe that should go with the Caro Kann version...).  
386,17,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2p1p1N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',Black is having none of it.  Jo has built up a fund of experience with the 4...Nf6 line which may be why Charles gave it the go-by.

388,17,6,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/8/1Bp1p1N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The obvious response.  Yet there was something to be said for 5....Nc6 even though Black might have got a lot of doubled pawns scattered about: 5...Nc6  6.Bxc6 bxc6  7.Nxe4 exf4 ...
389,17,7,exf4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/2p5/4Np2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In effect White has gambited a pawn but doesn't have all that much for it.  Could this be one of those positional gambits the hypermoderns used to play with a view to the ending?  White has the Q-side majority (which proves to be a major motif in this game) but realising it seems a long way off.
390,17,8,O-O,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/2p5/4Np2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Pragmatic: continuing her development.  But worth considering was 8.Qe2 a move that has some developmental value but tests Black's alertness.  If he were to play say 8...Nf6 then 9.Nd6# ends proceedings right there.  Black would just about have to play his lone already-developed piece (8...Ne4) to remain on roughly level terms.
391,17,9,Nec3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n2pp/8/2p2p2/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Rather awkward as it interferes with the development of the other knight.  Too bad: there doesn't seem to be anything better.
392,17,10,Bd6,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',An interesting development.  Black wants to maintain that lead f-pawn for as long as possible.  Was he already contemplating a direct attack upon White's King?  Note that the bishop exerts through the f-pawn a certain amount of pressure on h2.
393,17,11,Qh4,b'r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',(!?)  Sticking to his plan of attack against h2 and maintains the lead f-pawn for the time being as well.  The GK engine mislikes this in favour of 10...Ne2  11.Nb5!? Be5  12... 0-0-0.  This alternative is less committal but equally less forcing.  The game continuation does however give White the opportunity for counter-action.
394,17,12,1Qf3,b'r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p1q/2NP1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',(!?) Thematic but the GK engine indicates 11.Nb5 ought to have come first with attack against d6 and c7.  After 11.Nb5 the engine suggests 11...Bb8  12.Qf3 with threats against f4 and b7.  But 11...Be5 seems better as after 12.Qf3 Ne7  13.Qxb7?? Rb8  14.Qa6 Rb6  looks very nasty.  Instead 13.Bxf4 keeps things more or less level.  My own view is that the text move is unobjectionable.
395,17,13,1g5,b'r3k1nr/pp1n3p/3b4/2p2pp1/5p1q/2NP1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq g6',Further protection for f4 and stormclouds appear to be gathering darkly on the King-side.  Though 11...0-0-0 was more solid White would have been able by 12.Bxf4 somewhat to blunt Black's attack.  As it happens White doesn't appear to be much fazed by Black's threatening attitude...
396,17,14,1Qxb7,b'r3k1nr/pQ1n3p/3b4/2p2pp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Wins back the pawn and leaves Black centre and Q-side looking very porous.
397,17,15,1Qd5,b'1r2k1nr/p2n3p/3b4/2pQ1pp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b k -',(!?) Sensible-looking and centralising yet the GK engine doesn't approve.  According to its wisdom 13.Qa6 ought to have been played.  I'm inclined to agree as that move combines attack on a7 as well as d6.  But I think White wanted to keep the Queen nearer the action bearing in mind her Q-side has yet to make a move.
398,17,16,1Be5,b'1r2k1nr/p2n3p/8/2pQbpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w k -',(!) Good defence: keeps a watch over f4 (and h2) and closes off the e-file (else White might have continued Qe6ch and Re1).  
399,17,17,1Qe6+,b'1r2k1nr/p2n3p/4Q3/2p1bpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b k -',As planned I suspect but White might equally well have considered beginning to bring out her Q-side: 14.Nd2 with 15.Nf3 to follow.  Black has a bit of a lead in development that White can not afford to see become much longer.
400,17,18,1Kd8,b'1r1k2nr/p2n3p/4Q3/2p1bpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Black has to forgo castling as after 14...Ne7  15.Nd5! g4  16.Bxf4 Bxf4  17.Rxf4 Kd8 and white can exchange down into a very promising endgame: 18.Qxe7ch Qxe7  19.Nxe7 Kxe7  20.b3 - White would have the stronger pawns and an extra pawn as well.

403,17,21,1Bd4+,b'1r1k3r/p2n3p/7n/2p3p1/3b1p1q/2NP3Q/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',An intermezzo.  Black uses the check to improve the placing of the bishop.
404,17,22,Qxh3,b'1r1k3r/p2n3p/7n/2p3p1/3b1p2/2NP3q/PPP3PP/RNB2R1K w - -',According to the GK analysis Black's (slight) edge was slowly dissipating.  This can be a problem when gambiting material which in effect Black has done in recent moves and is now a pawn behind.  That the Queens are disappearing won't be altogether welcome in that context.  Once the compensating intangibles (time space initiative) disappear which they tend to do given time then the material advantage will come into its own.  
405,17,23,Nf5,b'1r1k3r/p2n3p/8/2p2np1/3b1p2/2NP3P/PPP4P/RNB2R1K w - -',Discouraging the knight's development to d2?

Interestingly GK suddenly gives a noticeable plus in favour of Black at this point but without giving any reason why or noting any improvement White might have.  19.Nd2? Ne3 could not be countenanced but how about 19.Ne4 preparing the way for the other knight?  An interesting forcing line ensues: 19.Ne4!? Ne3  20.Bxe3 Bxb2  21.Bd2 Bxa1  22.Ng5 with a complicated endgame to look forward to.  That White will have given up the exchange offers an intriguing counterpoint to the actual game.
407,17,25,1Nd6,b'1r1k3r/p2n3p/3n4/2p3p1/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPP4P/R1B2R1K w - -',(!?) Inhibiting the a3-Knight's further progress.  Also playable here was ...Bxc3 breaking up White's pawns.

409,17,27,2Bd2,b'1r1kr3/p2n3p/3n4/2p3p1/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPPB3P/1R3R1K b - -',At last all White's pieces are in action though Black's are still appreciably the more dynamic right now.  But there's the distinct feel to the game that suggests White is gradually beginning to assert her own stamp on proceedings.  If Black wants to make progress he'll have to do something - and that pretty shortly.
410,17,28,2Rb6,b'3kr3/p2n3p/1r1n4/2p3p1/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPPB3P/1R3R1K w - -',(!?) Aron Nimzovitch used to write about the 'mysterious rook move'.  Well the motivation for this move is pretty obscure unless Black was planning on a switch to the a-file or maybe to the K-side.  Or did Charles have some nefarious other scheme in mind?  We'll come to that...
411,17,29,2Rfe1,b'3kr3/p2n3p/1r1n4/2p3p1/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPPB3P/1R2R2K b - -',A pawn ahead White wants piece exchanges provided she doesn't have to make concessions to bring them about.  All the same 22.h4 was still worth considering.
412,17,30,h5,b'3k4/p2n4/1r1n4/2p3pp/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPP4P/1R2B2K w - h6',This pawn phalanx is Black's strike force and will always constitute a danger White has to watch.  White's majority on the other wing will take much longer to mobilise.  All the same the GK engine rated the position as dead level at this point.  I'm inclined to agree.
413,17,31,Ke7,b'8/p2nk3/1r1n4/2p3pp/3b1p2/N1NP3P/PPP3KP/1R2B3 w - -',(?/?!)  The first real mistake of the game according to GK.  A straightforward oversight it must have seemed to Jo when she saw this position.  But you know I am beginning to wonder about that.  Could Black have seen that his advantages were gradually eroding away and something needed to be done to create a wider range of possibilities even at the risk of conceding to his opponent real winning chances?  Maybe Charles can answer that question...
414,17,32,2Nd5+,b'8/p2nk3/1r1n4/2pN2pp/3b1p2/N2P3P/PPP3KP/1R2B3 b - -',Correct.  There's nothing against taking the proffered material and everything to recommend it.
415,17,33,axb6,b'8/3n4/1p1nk3/2p3pp/3b1p2/N2P3P/PPP3KP/1R2B3 w - -',Now is the time to assess the situation.  White is the rough equivalent of a piece ahead: Rook and pawn for a Knight.  But the extra pawn is doubled and a Rook's pawn at that.   Further Black's pieces are all nicely centralised with plenty of collaborative potential.  White's for the moment remain scattered.  And there is that niggling problem of the Black K-side majority well advanced and ready to go if given the chance.  I'm not saying Black has enough to hold on even for a draw; but he's got plenty to have a good old crack at it and even maybe turn the tables.  White has to tread very carefully and yet play decisively enough not to let slip her own chances to win.  Game on!
416,17,34,2Bf2,b'8/3n4/1p1nk3/2p3pp/3b1p2/N2P3P/PPP2BKP/1R6 b - -',Not a bad start: offer a piece exchange.  After 27..Bxf2 28.Kxf2 White will have conceded nothing to rid herself of Black's most mobile piece.
417,17,35,2Bf6,b'8/3n4/1p1nkb2/2p3pp/5p2/N2P3P/PPP2BKP/1R6 w - -',So: no sale.
418,17,36,2Nc4,b'8/3n4/1p1nkb2/2p3pp/2N2p2/3P3P/PPP2BKP/1R6 b - -',(?!)  Offering another exchange but this does concede something and more in my view than White ought to have been prepared to yield.  GK agrees preferring 28.b4.  Now the line GK follows is certainly very attractive for White: 28.b4 cxb4!?  29.Rxb4 Bc3  30.Rb1 Bd2(!?)  31.Bxb6 Nxb6  32.Rxb6 Be3.  At this point GK gives 33.Rb8 but I would probably play instead 33.Rxd6ch Kxd6  34.Nc4ch Kc5  35.Nxe3 fxe3  36.Kf3 Kd4  37.a4.  Even at the cost of giving up the exchange this simplification brings us down to a winning pawn ending.  If Black tries 28...Bd4 then 29.bxc5 brings about the mobilisation of White's own pawn majority.
419,17,37,2dxc4,b'8/3n4/1p2kb2/2p3pp/2P2p2/7P/PPP2BKP/1R6 b - -',Writes down part of White's material advantage and with this pawn doubled the White majority will be a little harder to get going.  While I'm at it many beginners and probably intermediate players too find minor pieces difficult to use without the aid of the heavy pieces.  This game offers a fine example of how they might be handled even in a difficult defence.  Be it noted though: White still has a considerable probably winning edge here.
420,17,38,3b3,b'8/8/1p3b2/2p1nkpp/2P2p2/1P5P/P1P2BKP/4R3 b - -',Really I don't like this move but it can't be helped.  The lead c-pawn requires protection.
421,17,39,3g4,b'8/8/1p3b2/2p1nk1p/2P2pp1/1P5P/P1P2BKP/4R3 w - -',Black has seized the initiative - for the moment at least - to make progress on the K-side.   But White seems well placed in defence on that wing.
422,17,40,hxg4,b'8/8/1p3b2/2p1nk2/2P2pp1/1P6/P1P2BKP/4R3 w - -',Well: White's h-pawn has been 'undoubled' for what that might be worth...  That means that there are fewer obstacles in frnt of Black's K-side pawns.
423,17,41,3Rd1,b'8/8/1p3b2/2p1nk2/2P2pp1/1P6/P1P2BKP/3R4 b - -',I can't find any improvement for either side in the last 5 moves.  Black's K-side has made some progress but seems to be stymied for now.  White now conjures up a threat of her own to mobilise her Q-side.  Once those pawns break loose. it will be all up for Black.
424,17,42,3Ke6,b'8/8/1p2kb2/2p1n3/2P2pp1/1P6/P1P2BKP/3R4 w - -',Hence this retreat to keep the rook out of d6.
425,17,43,3a4,b'8/8/1p2kb2/2p1n3/P1P2pp1/1P6/2P2BKP/3R4 b - a3',(?!) I believe that Jo had already worked out a plan to mobilise the Q-side in which this pawn was to advance to a5 backed up by the bishop on the e1-a5 diagonal.  I'll come back to that.  But I really dislike this move as making it harder to unleash the pawns.  Preferable is 34.a3 with the b4 advance in mind.  One possible line is 34.a3 Nc6 (say)  35.Rd5ch Be5  36.h4! f3ch  37.Kf1 Bf4  38.h5 g3  39.Bxg3 Bxg3  40.h6 and ironically White's K-side pawn wins the day!  
426,17,44,3Nc6,b'8/8/1pn1kb2/2p5/P1P2pp1/1P6/2P2BKP/3R4 w - -',Black has certainly the upper hand on the dark squares.  But it's hard to see how even this will prevail in the long run given White has the means to contest Black's dark-square ascendancy: her bishop.  
427,17,45,3Be1,b'8/8/1pn1kb2/2p5/P1P2pp1/1P6/2P3KP/3RB3 b - -',(?!) Here is Jo's plan: to shove forward the Q-side pawns with the bishop's backing.  The c-pawn will be undermined and the rook will take it out.  Well thought out but and this was sheer bad luck it turns out to be a mistaken plan.  By committing herself to the Q-side White allows Black some slack on the other wing.  There were good alternatives in 35.Rd5; 35.Bg1 (I like this move); or even in waiting 35.Kf1.  However This is not the losing move - in fact I reckon White still had the winning of the game after this move but this was one of those rare situations in which following a plan proves ones undoing.
428,17,46,3Bd2,b'8/8/1p2kb2/2p5/P1Pn1pp1/1P6/2PB2KP/3R4 b - -',(?) With this move probably White's winning chances start to fade away.  The GK engine prefers 36.Rd2 here though with ...Bg5 and ...f3ch in the air it is easy to pass this move by.  After 36.Rd2 Bg5  37.Kf1 Ke5  38.Bf2 f3  39.Bxd4ch cxd4  40.Rd3 Ke4  41.Rd1 Bf4   42.Kg1 Bg5  43.b4 Bh4  44.Kf1 and Black's K-side attack is running out of steam whilst White's pawns are ready to roll.  A whole different plan which seems less to teeter on the edge of the abyss was 36.c3! with the idea 36...Nxb3 37.Rb1 Na5 38.Rxb6ch Ke7  39.Rb5 Nxc4  40.Rxc5.  
429,17,47,3Kf5,b'8/8/1p3b2/2p2k2/P1Pn1pp1/1P6/2PB2KP/3R4 w - -',The GK engine still gives White an edge but already this is looking doubtful.  Though still nominally a piece down Black still has that menacing K-side and the more active pieces and pawns.  White's game is looking harder to get rolling than even a couple of moves ago...
430,17,48,3a5,b'8/8/1p3b2/P1p2k2/2Pn1pp1/1P6/2PB2KP/3R4 b - -',According to plan.  More complicated was 37.b4 but it might have been worth a look.
431,17,49,Nxc2,b'8/8/5b2/B1p2k2/2P2pp1/1P6/2n3KP/3R4 w - -',The complicating factor is the threatened fork at e3 which persists after White's next.  All the same GK now considered the game evenly balanced.  This would have been a disappointment to Jo but immersed as she was in her scheme to break the chains about her Q-side pawns no doubt thought she still had the better of it and soon she would be home free.
432,17,50,4Rxc5,b'8/8/5b2/B1R5/2P1kpp1/1P6/2n3KP/8 b - -',(?) Twin passers on the Q-side!  The culmination of White's plan... and the move that put even the draw out of reach.  It just one of those horrible situations in which you suddenly realise that the creaking of the thin ice that you thought was coming from under the other guy's feet were actually being caused by your own bootsteps.  Who said it?  'Chess is a cruel game...'  Better chances of a draw were offered in these lines: [a] 40.Rd7  f3ch  41.Kf1 Bd4  42.Bd2 Kd3  43.Bg5 Na1  44.Rf7 Nxb3   45.h3  Be3  46.Rd7ch Bd4  47.Rf7 with a repetition; or [b] 40.Bd2 f3ch  43.Kf1 Be5   44.Rxc5 Bxh2  45.Rg5 g3  46.Rg4ch Kd3  47.Bf4 g2ch (...Ne3ch=) 48.Kf2 g1=Qch  49.Rxg1 Bxg1ch  50.Kxg1 =.
433,17,51,4Kf1,b'8/8/5b2/B1R5/2P1k1p1/1P3p2/2n4P/5K2 b - -',(?) But 41.Kh1 still lost after 41...f2  42.Kg2 Bh4  43.Re5ch! - The best White can do to slow things down was to give up the rook for nothing - 43...Kxe5.  Mind you White could still have resisted for a while even brought about a close finish:  44.Bb6 Ne1ch  45.Kf1 Nf3  46.Bxf2! Nxh2ch!  47.Kg2 Bxf2  48.Kxf2 Kf4  49.b4  {or 49.c5 Nf3  50.c6 Nd2!  51.c7 Ne4ch  52.Kg2 Nd6  53.b4 Nc8 etc} 49...Nf3  50.b5 g3ch  51.Kg2 Nh4ch  52.Kg1 Nf5  53.c5 Ne7  54.c6 Ne8 etc.  Interesting also would have been 41.Kg3 Bh4ch!  42.Kxh4 f2  43.Bc7 f1=Q  44.Re5ch Kd3 but White's pawns are too scattered and weak for her to set up any kind of fortress.
434,17,52,Bh4,b'8/8/8/B1R5/2P1k1pb/1P2np2/7P/6K1 w - -',(0-1) At this point Jo tossed in the sponge: there's no cure for ...f2ch.  There's a good deal to be got out of this game.  For one thing it shows how hard it can be to overcome a determined defence.  In this game for all his material deficit Black had a good deal to play with so White's task to win the game was no light matter.  It was her truly evil luck to hit on a plan of attack that seemed to promise a clear path to her goal - her Celestial City -  only to discover it was the road into the Slough of Despond.   Ask Christian: some days you just can't win.

He has the opportunity to attack with Nd5 c3 or a3 with b4 and opening the position of the king. The 2 rooks can be transfered quickly. That plan springs to mind in an instant. White may also consider moves like Qh5 Nf5 or Ng6 with Nd5 and f4. Black's position is very difficult already. Most stronger players on this site could recieve a winning ad from this position as white. Once black hass castled a critical principle comes in play. When 2 players are castled opposite the one that gets to the other first will usually recieve the advantage. Whether it is with pieces(open positions generally) or pawns morelikely this principle will likely decide the game in these kind of positions. Black cannot really attack now he is not developed enough and his attack is hard to generate.

In fact black's knight has good prospects certainly better than the bishop. Also black has now fully developed with white's help and can advance on the kingside and transfer a rook. Black has good conterplay and stands fine but white still is just a bit more comfortable as the bishop can be freed with c3 and b4 or a line can be opened for the white rooks leading to the black king.

Now white plays h3 to lock up the kingside more. It will be hard to break through.@l-d-j ...g4 will open the kingside. But since white could hardly do much to stop him why shouldn't black transfer a rook now? ...g4 now is much better than h4 though. Thats why I wasn't so sure about the execution.

Probably a good move but g4 was viable and if white captures then the white king is in mortal danger on the kingside. I can invision all the black pieces aimed for g2 all the white ones defending. Then a timely breakthrough using the knight is possible while the bishop is near useless. If white does not capture on g4 black follows up h3 and the white king is once again in danger.

Black will have the white kingside blasted open and invade with Rg8 and a full assortment of major pieces. White will be totally losing. After 22...g4 black can wait and pack a full force behind the pawns before capturing. Analysis of lines is not critically important here as long as black watches out for threats or plans white has to stop his attack. Otherwise black can just 'play along' as he adjusts his possibilities to counter white's defense. It does work. With limited time I definitely have not looked at all lines but can see that black is totally in control here.

After 24...Qxg4+ 25.fxg4 Rh4 the pawn is a goner and black would probably win anyways with his superior minor piece as well so Qg4 will not save white. However white does have 25.f4 and if f5 can be gotten in quickly white may have staved off an immediate death. 25...exf4 26.Rxf4 white can hopefully close by doubling on the f file or trading some pieces. Even this gives white an ad though. Without the attack black has a better minor piece.

Not a good choice and the pieces left on the board a rook and king for each do not promise black anything. Now his only hope is that after black blockades the pawns with ease he will be able to create a 2nd weak spot on the queenside thus winning. This task would be eased if black had his good knight.

A great idea and if white tries to trade rooks Rf2 then move the rook where it is guarded by the e pawn and moev the king out. A great idea.---------However not the only way to win. If white had played the more accurate 33.Kf2 black would break through on the queenside and threaten white's pawns with his king. White's own king cannot assist it is too far away. Not only can black's rook guard the g pawn it can play important defense along the 678th ranks. If white's rook ventures to far into black's camp black will let the g pawn go and penetrate himself. This will win. Black can start by moving to Kc6. All black has to do here is put the rook on g7 and king on c6 and break with the king. Once the rook is off the f file it will have to the g7 rook penetrates taking ALL the pawns.

If white cannot blockade the pawn it will advance. It doesn't even have to advance now becuase the white king nor the white rook will be stopping it.But in my previous update Kf2 also loses.

If white tries to invade through Rh5 black will also gain access into the white position through f file and black will prevail. The f file black rook will serve as a wall for the black king and eats the white pawns from behind. I suggest now to simply activate the king for white. Unfortunately the line 34...g3 is unpleasant for black. There are unguarded pawns on ranks 1  and 2. This move allows a penetraation capture or not. Black plays 34...g3 threatening gxh3+ and Rg2+ winning. Rf3 does not help. No good counters are there for black... capturing looses the d3 pawn and all of the queenside pawns...

658,24,40,2Nxd4,b'r2qk2r/pQ1b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/PP2KPPP/8 b - -',and I take back his pawn
659,24,41,2Rb8,b'1r1qk2r/pQ1b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/PP2KPPP/8 w - -',He goes for my queen with his rook.
660,24,42,2Qxa7,b'1r1qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/PP2KPPP/8 b - -',I take his pawn on a7
661,24,43,2Rxb2+,b'3qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/Pr2KPPP/8 w - -',He checks me again
662,24,44,2Kf1,b'3qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/Pr3PPP/5K2 b - -',I move my king once more.
663,24,45,2Rd2,b'3qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p2b2/8/3N4/2N5/P2r1PPP/5K2 w - -',Black casually moves his rook to d2 as he eyes down my knight with both his rook and his bishop. I have to move one of my knights..Which one?
664,24,46,2Nf5,b'3qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p2b2/5N2/8/2N5/P2r1PPP/5K2 b - -',I move one of my knights to f5. One of them has to be taken. I think I chose wisely.
665,24,47,2Bxc3,b'3qk2r/Q2b2pp/2p5/5N2/8/2b5/P2r1PPP/5K2 w - -',Looking at the board now...I am down -12 in material...and I only have 2 active pieces to his 5 active pieces...how did I do it? This is the good part !!!
666,24,48,2Qe3+,b'3qk2r/3b2pp/2p5/5N2/8/2b1Q3/P2r1PPP/5K2 b - -',I check him with my queen at the same time getting ready to take his bishop.
667,24,49,2Kf8,b'3q1k1r/3b2pp/2p5/5N2/8/2b1Q3/P2r1PPP/5K2 w - -',He moves his king.
668,24,50,2Qxc3,b'3q1k1r/3b2pp/2p5/5N2/8/2Q5/P2r1PPP/5K2 b - -',I take his bishop and now his rook is looking nice.

671,24,53,2Rd5,b'3q1k1r/3b2pp/2p5/3r1N2/8/2Q5/P3KPPP/8 w - -',I don't think this was a good move by black to retreat his rook and go for my knight. a better move would be to check my again with his queen by going black queen to e8. Instead he moves his rook to d5. 
672,24,54,2Qxg7+,b'3q1k1r/3b2Qp/2p5/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 b - -',You probably saw this coming. Its the move I was waiting on. I check his king at the same time his rook is threatened and I am protected by the knight on f5. At this point not much he can do but follow my lead.
673,24,55,2Ke8,b'3qk2r/3b2Qp/2p5/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 w - -',he moves his king again
674,24,56,2Qxh8+,b'3qk2Q/3b3p/2p5/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 b - -',I take his rook. Again checking him !
675,24,57,2Kf7,b'3q3Q/3b1k1p/2p5/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 w - -',His queen is now vulnerable
676,24,58,3Qxd8,b'3Q4/3b1k1p/2p5/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 b - -',now his queen is taken. and I am up in material. The tables have now turned that quickly. I think his best move here would be to check me or take my knight.
677,24,59,3Be6,b'3Q4/5k1p/2p1b3/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 w - -',He chose bishop to e7 to guard his rook.
678,24,60,3Qe7+,b'8/4Qk1p/2p1b3/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 b - -',Again I check him and threaten his bishop.
679,24,61,3Kg6,b'8/4Q2p/2p1b1k1/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 w - -',He is setting himself up now but he has no choice.
680,24,62,3Qxe6+,b'8/7p/2p1Q1k1/3r1N2/8/8/P3KPPP/8 b - -',At this point my opponent resigns as he will most likely be checkmated in on a couple moves.

719,25,38,4Nc6,b'5b2/5k1p/2N3p1/8/1B1P4/3K3P/6P1/2r5 b - -',A smart move but it has a flaw.

722,26,0,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The uncommon line on Benko's opening. The fianchetto is very hypermodern although I don't particularly like it.
723,26,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',Black has central control.

742,26,20,1Bc5,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/5n1q/n1bP4/2P5/N3PN1b/PB4BP/R2Q1K1R w - -',Black is mobilizing his pieces to attack the White formation which is looking a bit soft.

744,26,22,1Ne4,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/7q/n1bP4/2P1n3/N3PN1b/PB4BP/2RQ1K1R w - -',Perhaps not preferable to 15... Bxe3.

748,26,26,1Kxg2,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/7q/n1bP4/2P5/N3P3/PB1Q2KP/2R4R b - -',Not what White wanted. The queen still threatens Black's knight on a5.
749,26,27,1Qxe3,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/8/n1bP4/2P5/N3q3/PB1Q2KP/2R4R w - -',If White takes the knight then the king's in serious trouble.
750,26,28,Bxe3,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/8/n2P4/2P5/N3b3/PB4KP/2R4R w - -',So we have a queen trade and a threat on the White rook on c1.
751,26,29,2Bxg7,b'2k1r2r/ppp2pBp/8/n2P4/2P5/N3b3/P5KP/4R2R b - -',White tries to chase the bishop away and instead gets more threats on his position so he will cherry-pick the pawn.
752,26,30,2Kf3,b'2k1r1r1/ppp2pBp/8/n2P4/2P5/N3bK2/P6P/4R2R b - -',The bishop is getting annoying and must be removed.
753,26,31,2Kxe3,b'2k5/ppp2prp/8/n2P4/2P5/N3K3/P6P/7R b - -',The White bishop Black figures could be dangerous later so Black figures to start clearing the board.  That said his knight is still trapped.
754,26,32,2c6,b'2k5/pp3prp/2p5/n2P4/2P5/N3K3/P6P/7R w - -',And this helps clear that up.
755,26,33,2h4,b'2k5/pp3prp/2p5/n2P4/2P4P/N3K3/P7/7R b - h3',White wants all his pawns as far up the board as possible.
756,26,34,2cxd5,b'2k5/pp3prp/8/n2P4/7P/N3K3/P7/7R b - -',Now the knight is still trapped but he can more easily escape.
757,26,35,2Kd7,b'8/pp1k1prp/8/n2P4/7P/N3K3/P7/7R w - -',The king must get involved.
758,26,36,2Ke4,b'8/pp1k1prp/8/n2P4/4K2P/N7/P7/7R b - -',A duel coming.
759,26,37,2Kd4,b'8/pp1k2rp/5p2/n2P4/3K3P/N7/P7/7R b - -',Black has managed to intimidate White's king onto the d-file where White's pawn is a nice little piece to be maneuvered around.
760,26,38,2Nc4+,b'8/pp4rp/3k1p2/n2P4/2NK3P/8/P7/7R b - -',This is just stupid. White has Black's knight trapped and useless and he just throws away his own knight.
761,26,39,Rg4+,b'8/pp5p/3k1p2/3P4/2K3rP/8/P7/7R w - -',Black has an advantage here as White's pawn is as good as dead and Black's pawns are more maneuverable not to mention more in number.
762,26,40,Kxd5,b'8/pp5p/5p2/3k4/6rP/3K4/P7/7R w - -',White is seriously on the defensive.
763,26,41,3a4,b'8/pp5p/5p2/3k4/P5rP/3K4/8/7R b - a3',More due to a lack of ability to do anything else.
764,26,42,3Kf3,b'8/pp5p/5p2/3k4/4r2P/5K2/8/7R b - -',White's king has been chased to the side of the board and his rook is stuck protecting the h-pawn.

766,26,44,3h6,b'8/p7/5p1p/1p2k2P/4r3/6K1/8/7R w - -',Black has now neutralized White's pawn. No more dilly-dallying for Black.
767,26,45,3Rb1,b'8/p7/5p1p/4k2P/1p2r3/5K2/8/1R6 b - -',White has to defend against the pawn.
768,26,46,3f5,b'8/p7/7p/4kp1P/1p2r3/5K2/8/1R6 w - -',More attacks!
769,26,47,4Ra1,b'8/8/7p/p3kp1P/1p2r3/5K2/8/R7 b - -',Black has been content to quietly advance his pawns as White's rook runs all over the first rank. That cannot continue; it's action time.
770,26,48,4Rb5,b'8/8/7p/1R3pkP/1p2r3/5K2/8/8 b - -',White can take either pawn and will keep Black on his toes; White can still easily win this game.
771,26,49,Rxh5,b'8/8/7p/1R3pkr/1p6/3K4/8/8 w - -',White is now clutching at straws. The pawn ought to be taken now just to get it off the board and allow White to regroup.
772,26,50,4Kc4,b'8/8/7p/1R3pkr/1pK5/8/8/8 b - -',But for some bizarre reason it isn't. The weak pin is too irresistible for Black.
773,26,51,Re4,b'8/8/7p/1R3pk1/1p2r3/1K6/8/8 w - -',Now the bridge is built and Black can comfortably promote a pawn.
774,26,52,h5,b'8/8/8/1R3pkp/Kp2r3/8/8/8 w - -',White now has nothing left and ought to resign here. But he doesn't.
775,26,53,h4,b'8/8/8/5pk1/1K5p/8/8/8 w - -',Black to avoid complications will just promote the h-pawn.
776,26,54,h1=Q,b'8/8/8/5pk1/8/8/4K3/7q w - -',Now how to checkmate?
777,26,55,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/6k1/5p2/8/5K2/7q b - -',This isn't smart. If White is determined to play on he ought to escape into the open board where Black may make some mistake.
778,26,56,f3+,b'8/8/8/8/6k1/5p2/4K3/7q w - -',The pattern continues.
779,26,57,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/8/6k1/5p2/5K2/7q b - -',This need to stay close to the action speeds up the checkmate.
780,26,58,Qe2#,b'8/8/8/8/6k1/5p2/4q3/4K3 w - -',Overall I love bloodbaths. Lesson learned: don't offer trapped pieces a way out. That's where White's game really went to crap. Also that fiancehttos don't work.

So I see you enjoyed that game where I gave my Class C opponent a hard time with a central pawn push.  In this game (which began with a Queen Pawn Opening) against a Class A 1800+ opponent it was one passer on one side and two connected pawns on the other in a rook and pawn ending.  Although the connected pawns were on the kingside they were not passed.  However my decoy pawn enticed the rooks to be swapped off and my kingside pawn majority proved decisive.  Glenda's arrival heralded victory for Yours Truly.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16196577&rnd=0.8325142630569565"

962,31,24,Kg8,b'5rk1/6pp/8/p7/3K4/8/6P1/2R5 w - -',40. .... Kg8 - Henry decided to get the Old Matey monkey off his back by moving towards the centre.  Incredibly Henry will stay rooted to this square for the rest of the game and merely watch procedings on both sides of the board.

966,31,28,4Kc3,b'6k1/8/8/6p1/7p/2K5/6P1/8 b - -',49. Kc3 - the WK tries to stop the black pawns from reaching Glendadom but it will be to no avail.
967,31,29,gxh3,b'6k1/8/8/8/8/3K3p/8/8 w - -',51. ..... gxh3 - under a set of conditional moves a decisive pawn trade takes place.  Only one dear little pawn is left on the board so why should white resign two moves down the line?
968,31,30,h1=Q,b'6k1/8/8/8/8/8/5K2/7q w - -',"53. ..... h1/Q - well you see on h1 there is now a big black queen her name is Glenda and she is loaded with 9 units of checkmate!  So that is why white waves that white flag!  As both Henry and Glenda have shared an intimate dinner for two of garlic prawn vindaloo to celebrate their tearful reunion her breath and tongue will smell and taste particularly unpleasant to the WK so I do not blame Etienne for trying to avoid this.  Now how will she force mate from here?  Well here is a sample line.

I feel I need to give myself a bit of a lift after losing a game to an Expert that I should have won albeit I lost because I adopted the wrong plan in the endgame.  Many thanks to Coach Ion btw for annotating that game.  At least I can take some heart that I learned a lesson from GM Cyrano (annotated game here http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/cyrano?gm=38055) about the value of connected passed central pawns.  In this game I did manage to get one of those pawns one square away from Glendadom before my opponent waved the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.

As noted it's actually a defence that focueses around the four black moves: d6 Nf6 g6 and usually Bg7 and on White's side d4 e4 (or in a different order) Nc3. White has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4 4Nf3 4Be3 or 4 g3).
