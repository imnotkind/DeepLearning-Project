1,0,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',We'll go with my usual opening (I tried summat different in the next match and it worked. Badly.)
2,0,2,a4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/P1B1P3/2P2N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq a3',Probably a bit weak too nervous of this opponent.
3,0,3,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/3Bp3/PP2n3/B1P2N2/3P1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',After cursing myself for leaving a pawn hanging I got lucky here. I couldn't see any trap so a free knight is a free knight.
4,0,4,Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3pn3/PP1Np3/B1P5/2BP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Neither side overly well developed. Looking at b3 for the bishop but the whole queen side rather congested.... guess which side I'm hoping to tuck the king away on.
5,0,5,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3pn3/PP1Np3/B1P5/2BP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Hey I never said I could play this game.
6,0,6,Qd6,b'r1b2r1k/ppp3pp/3qB3/4npb1/PP1Np3/B1P5/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',I had hoped for BxB KxB but he isn't falling for that one.
7,0,7,1b5,b'r1b2r1k/ppp3pp/3qB3/1P2npb1/P2Np3/B1P5/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',So I go for a nasty little exposed instead. Pure fortune it was there but I've found I can set those up and pretty much leave those grenades around.
8,0,8,1f4,b'r1b2q1k/ppp3pp/4B3/1P2npb1/P2NpP2/2P5/6PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - f3',Hoping that my opponent isn't familiar with en passant.
9,0,9,1exf3e.p.,b'r1b2q1k/ppp3pp/4B3/1P2npb1/P2N4/2P2p2/6PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Poo.
10,0,10,2Ne6,b'2r2q1k/ppp3pp/4N3/1P2npb1/P7/2P2p2/6PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Now that I thought at the time was a great move but it gets me into trouble.
11,0,11,2Kh1,b'2r2q1k/ppp3pp/4N3/1P2np2/P7/2P1bp2/6PP/RN1Q1R1K b - -',Forces me into a corner and then I'm getting worried about g2.
12,0,12,2Nd4,b'2r4k/ppp3pp/5q2/1P2np2/P2N4/2P1bp2/6PP/RN1Q1R1K b - -',Offering the sacrifice. Expecting R-d8.
13,0,13,2fxg2+,b'2r4k/ppp3pp/5q2/1P2np2/P2N4/2P1b3/6pP/RN1Q1R1K w - -',Now that opens up the King defences but I felt it was premature. With the knight guarding f3 I felt he could have taken a tempo to move the queen into position or pin the knight to the queen with the rook.
14,0,14,2Nf3,b'2r4k/ppp3pp/8/1P2n1q1/P4p2/2P1bN2/7P/RN1Q1R1K b - -',Now from this point I felt for most of the rest of the match as if I was one move from disaster.
15,0,15,fxe3,b'4r2k/p1p3pp/1p6/1Pq5/P7/2P1pQ2/7P/3R1R1K w - -',That I hadn't thought through properly either.

17,0,17,3Rf7,b'4r2k/p1p2Rp1/1pQ4p/1P2q3/P7/2P1p3/7P/4R2K b - -',Yeah. Well.
18,0,18,3Rxc7,b'4r2k/p1R3p1/1pQ4p/1P2q3/P7/2P5/4p2P/4R2K b - -',Now greed overcoming my innate good sense.
19,0,19,3Rf8,b'5r1k/p1R3p1/1pQ4p/1P2q3/P7/2P5/4p2P/4R2K w - -',And getting my just deserts.
20,0,20,3Rxg7,b'5r1k/p5R1/1pQ4p/1P2q3/P7/2P5/4p2P/4R2K b - -',If I'd played Q-g2 the rook would have gone anyway. And since this move prevented the immediate R-f1 (I thought) it meant I got a lowly pawn in exchange.
21,0,21,3Rf1+,b'7k/p5R1/1pQ4p/1P2q3/P7/2P5/4p2P/4Rr1K w - -',That confused the heck out of me.
22,0,22,3Qe8+,b'4Q2k/p7/1p5p/1P6/P4q2/2P5/4p2P/4RrRK b - -',But seeing an opportunity I decide to avoid the whole mess.....
23,0,23,3Qg8#,b'6Q1/p6k/1p5p/1P6/P4q2/2P5/4p2P/4RrRK b - -',And I'm sure I got called a few names for that one.
24,1,0,Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/2b1N3/2P5/2NPP1P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',!? -- This is a pseudo-sac I play in the Cordell variation of the Spanish when Black doiesn't immediately retreat his Bishop to b6. Since the opportunity presents itself here let's see how well it works when played in the English.
25,1,1,1Rfe1,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pp1/2pp1nnp/8/2PP2b1/2N1B1P1/PPQ2PBP/R3R1K1 b - -',Chances appear to be even so White's 7th move while perhaps a bit startling at the moment it was played leads to no particular advantage aside from having a bit more space.
26,1,2,2Qe2,b'6k1/pp3pp1/2ppqnnp/8/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2QPKP/4B3 b - -',White's Bishop plus the space advantage gives him an eensy plus probably not enough to win. Of course positions like these are winnable with correct strategies and (it must be said) a little help from one's opponent.
27,1,3,2f3,b'6k1/pp2npp1/2ppqn1p/8/2PP4/2N2PP1/PP2Q1KP/4B3 b - -',Not only preparing f2 for the Bishop holding the d-pawn but also to prevent Black's f6N from getting deeper access into White's position.
28,1,4,d5,b'6k1/4npp1/p1p1qn1p/1p1p4/2PP4/1PN2PP1/P3QBKP/8 w - -',I found this invitation to freeze the Q-side a little odd because my strategic sense tells me that's where the game will be decided as a matter of the eventual repositioning of the Kings and pieces for activity in the center.
29,1,5,2Qxe6,b'6k1/4npp1/p1p1Qn1p/1p1p4/2PP4/1PN2PP1/P4BKP/8 b - -',Getting the ladies off the board reduces the danger of a sudden tactical strike for both sides. Doing it now before closing the Queenside allows White to keep his N on the 3rd rank without having to waste a tempo repositioning it there after Black initiates the Q trade compelling Nxe2.
30,1,6,g5,b'8/5k2/2p2n1p/1pPp2p1/1P1B4/3n1PP1/N5KP/8 w - g6',Initiating a minority attack. Not a bad idea but its soundness is reduced a tad by the fact Black's d3N is undefended and can be attacked.
31,1,7,3h3,b'8/8/2p4p/1pPpk3/1P4n1/6PP/4K3/2N5 b - -',I don't want Black too feel too secure about dashing his King toward b4 and the only way to do this is to create a meaningful threat of a passed pawn on the Kingside.
32,1,8,3Ne2,b'8/8/2p4p/1pPpk3/1P2n3/4K1PP/4N3/8 b - -',! -- This is a critical moment and I'm sure some readers will want to know why I didn't play 39. Nd3+ driving Black's King back. Well the main reason is that driving back Black's King doesn't cure my weakness at b4 which can be attacked in two moves by Black's Knight. Strategically the more important square for White's Knight is d4 attacking Black's own conspicuous weakling at c6 which can't be defended by Black's King except from d7 so that he gets driven back anyway and farther away from the passed pawn White can create on the Kingside. And if I capture at c6 then b4 is defended at least for one critical tempo.
33,1,9,3Ng5,b'8/8/2p4p/1pPpk1n1/1P6/4K1PP/4N3/8 w - -',? -- A small wolfish smile here: White's h-pawn is nowhere near as important as Black's c-pawn. The correct move as horrible as it looks and despite the fact Black still may not be able to hold is 39. ...Ke6.
34,1,10,4Kf4,b'8/8/4k2p/1NPp4/1P2nK2/6P1/8/8 b - -',! -- Stopping any hoped-for penetration by Black's King because White's b5N freezes the d-pwan.
35,1,11,4Nd4+,b'8/8/4k2p/2Pp4/1P1N1K2/6P1/3n4/8 b - -',And Black's time expired. Regardless Black cannot move his King out of check: If Black plays to f6 to stop White's King from penetrating at e5 then the joined passers start rolling with 46. c6 and White's King will eventually penetrate anyway with options to take out Black's d-pawn h-pawn or even both. And if Black plays the King to either e7 or d7 his d-pawn will fall. 
36,2,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The Caro-Kann
37,2,1,f6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1np1pp/2p2p2/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',...e6 looks better because it protects the bishop.
38,2,2,Nh4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1np1pp/2p2p2/3pPb2/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',! Usually it's not wise to put the knight on the edge.  Usually it's not wise to move the same piece twice in the opening.  But here white either wins the bishop pair or black has to play the ugly ...Be6.  (Be4 is met with e6 Nb6. Bh5+ where white is winning after f3)
39,2,3,Bg6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1np1pp/2p2pb1/3pP3/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',? Understandable but still bad.  The best was actually ...Be6 which prevented white's next move.
40,2,4,e6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1np1pp/2p1Ppb1/3p4/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',A bolt of lightning!  Suddenly half of black's pieces are permanently out of play.

45,2,9,1h3,b'r4bnr/ppk1pQp1/1npqPp2/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1BPP1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',h2 was threatened.

47,2,11,1c3,b'r4b2/ppk1pQp1/1npqPp1r/3p4/3P4/2P4P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R b KQ -',I played this over Nc3 because I wanted the knight on c5 via a d2 b3 c5 maneuver.
48,2,12,Nb6,b'r4b2/ppk1pQp1/1npqPp1r/3p4/3P4/1PP4P/P3BPP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',? Missing important counterplay.  Best was Qf4 threatening Qc1+ and then winning the c-pawn.  I would have responded with 0-0.  But the resulting position is better for black than the text.

Interesting is ...Nxd4 and after Rxf6 Qxf6 cxd4 Qxd4 black has only one pawn for the piece but suddenly it is white who has inactive pieces and no real play.
61,2,25,2Rxg5,b'1k1r1b2/pp2p2Q/2pq1r2/P2p2R1/3P1p2/1PP2B1P/5PP1/1N3K1R b - -',Thank you all for commenting and rating.
62,3,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I keep the game on Classical lines.
63,3,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Naturally I must accept the gambit! It is the honorable thing to do.

You see while Anand’s rook move is not new in this position it is less common than the move 10. … a6. This move is very natural. Black’s main goal in these sorts of double queen pawn openings is to play his pawn to c5 under favorable circumstances. This move frees his position and gets rid of a weak backward pawn. The problem with playing the pawn to c5 directly is that the pawn on b5 is then left without protection. So moving the pawn to a6 first to protect the pawn on b5 makes a lot of sense.

Ng5 is unsound for white when black has played 11.... Rc8 instead of playing  11.... a6 first. However Anand still had to see the game till the very end from here. He thought for a full one and a half hours before he made his next move.

Usually in this situation after black's usual move of 11. ... a3 white’s knight move makes a lot of sense. Of course black can play the tactical shot 11. … Bxh2+ 12. Kxh2 Ng4+ and after white gets out of check black will win back the piece with 13. … Qxg5. The general feeling though is that white’s two bishops and better coordination give him a strong position.

The significance of this game is that Anand showed why white’s Ng5 idea is a bit dubious after Rc8. Black did not go for the tactical shot nor did he worry about the weak h-pawn nor did he worry about a weakness on b5. He simply played 12. … c5 right away. The line-up of the black rook on c8 with the white queen on c2 gives black a lot of tactical possibilities. White replied with 13. Nxh7 grabbing a pawn and threatening the rook on f8. Anand then played 13. … Ng4 leading to this position: "

Black will reply with Nxc5 and suddenly white has all sorts of problems. Black is threatening both to win back the piece by taking the white bishop on d3 and also to play Qd4+. taking advantage of the diagonal opened by white when he moved his pawn to f4. The tactics get very messy to calculate but suffice it to say that black is doing very well indeed.

So white tried 16. Be2 here with the idea of chasing back the black knight on g4. If black were actually forced to retreat now this would be a good move. Sadly for white Anand has another trick up his sleeve. 


OK again you're playing black. What would be your next move?"

Anand played 16. … Nde5!! (That’s right! Two double exclam moves in a row!!)

Let’s take stock. Black’s bishop on c5 his knight on e5 and his rook on f8 are all under attack. If the knight on e5 moves then the knight on g4 will be hanging. But white is the one in big trouble!

Calculating all the variations would lengthen this post beyond decency so let’s just look at how things went."

It looks like black could now play the crushing move Qh4. He must resist the temptation to do so however since white would then get the last laugh by playing Qh7+. Black would be forced to exchange queens after which his attack is kaput and white will just be up an exchange.

The third double exclam move in the same game ! Anand played 19. … f5!!. A quiet move this time. He simply shuts down the diagonal leading from c4 to h7. Now he really is threatening to play Qh4 after which white will run out of time before finding a reasonable defense.

These quiet moves are always the hardest to find. After the game Anand remarked that he felt proud of himself for having found 19. ... f5 over the board.

The fourth double exclam move in the same game. This move cuts off the Aronian's Queen from defending his pawn on h3. And Aronian resigned here.....What a finish by Anand ! 

A masterful game by Anand one of the most underrated world champions ever. Actually he is probably among the top 8 chess players of all time. See this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_top_chess_players_throughout_history

My plan then was to block the Kingside (White pawns in f4-g3-h4 Black ones in f5-g6-h5) and enter in the Queenside with my King via e1-d1-c1-b1-a2-b3-c4-b5. My Rook would have occupied the e5 square making really hard for Black to push on b5. If Black finally goes for a Rook exchange when I'm in the corner I would accept because Black King has no entrances in my position and I would have had a won pawn endgame.

Double c-pawns won't be weak whites pawn center will be significantly enhanced by LS bishop and blacks have just given 2 bishops to whites. As long as position will most likely remain opened 2 bishops will give whites good stable advantage.

323,17,6,Nd7,b'r4rk1/p1pnqppp/2pp4/8/4PPb1/2PB4/P1PQ2PP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',? It's probably a blunder. Black knight has cut the black bishop off the camp and now it can be trapped since black knight doesn't have any tempo-winning moves.
324,17,7,1Qf2,b'r4rk1/p1p1qppp/2pp2b1/4nP2/4P1P1/2PB3P/P1P2Q2/R1B1R1K1 b - -',"? Well that's basically a mistake that could cost quite a lot. The point is that I've moved my queen to f-file which undoubtedly will be opened after capture at g6. Actually quite stupid move and blacks could save their bishop by a simple answer 16... h6

Now if 17. fg?! fg 18. Qg3 Rf3 (18... Nf3?+ returns some material but it seems rather weak since blacks attack will weaken without a knight) with threat Qh4 so white will have to play precisely just not to lose in few moves. 19. Qg2 (19. Qh2? Qh4 with threat of Rxh3 followed by Nf3+) Qh4 20. Re3 Raf8 -+ white pieces are paralyzed while black keep threats Rg3 and Rf2

Thus whites would have to refuse to capture the black bishop to maintain significant advantage (+/- black bishop will be off game basically) so i wouldn't definitely say that 16... h6 was a better choice. Sometimes it's better to go into mathematically worse variation but giving some counter-play and practical chances to save/win the game. Let's say both 16... h6 and 16... Re8 deserve consideration (!?)."

But I wanted to keep things dynamic and after 30. ...c5  31. c4 Ra3  32. Rd3 bc4  33. Bc4 Rd3  34. Bd3 White has the same sort of ability to create a passed pawn on the h-file (as in the previous game) as a way to keep Black honest with his c-pawn.

But now comes a very long sequence of moves where both players explore the subtleties of this basic position by continuing to maneuver to win what is almost certainly a technically drawn position. Material is even but Black's doubled pawns on the f-file (a thing created waaay back in the opening) certainly don't help.
373,20,12,4Bd7,b'5k2/3B1p2/5p2/4p3/1p2P1PP/2b5/2P1K3/8 b - -',Tease! White wants Black to pursue the Bishop to the Queenside neglecting his Kingside in the process.
374,20,13,4Kg7,b'8/3B1pk1/5p2/4p3/1p2P1PP/2b5/2P1K3/8 w - -',Nope. Darn.

376,20,15,4Kc5,b'8/5p2/5p1k/2K1pB2/1p2P1PP/8/2P5/4b3 b - -',Black's c-pawn can't advance at any rate and White's h-pawn is unimportant so why not try to wring as much out of the position as possible?
377,20,16,4Kxb4,b'8/5p2/5p1k/4pB2/1K2P1Pb/8/2P5/8 b - -',Now White has the only meaningful pawn on the board. Black should have simply played his Bishop to c3 and offered the draw which would have been immediately accepted.
378,20,17,5Kb5,b'8/5p2/5p1k/1K2pB2/4P1P1/8/2P5/4b3 b - -',It's pretty hard to go wrong here. White can drive the c-pawn forward regardless of Black's desires. Eg.: 50. ...Bc3  51. Kc4 and the pawn moves to c3 next and beyond and there's nothing Black can do to stop it except race his King to the Q-side or give up his Bishop.
379,20,18,5Bh7,b'3k4/5p1B/1bPK1p2/4p3/4P1P1/8/8/8 b - -',White has just about the ideal position now with his pawn on a square the LSB can defend. Now it's will be a matter of finding out if White can trick or compel Black to lose a vital tempo that either advances the pawn or allows the White King to slip in behind Blacks pawns.
380,20,19,Kc5,b'8/2b5/2P2K2/2kBp3/4P3/8/8/8 w - -',Black cracks just enough here to raise spectres of doubt concerning his ability to defend the position. He should have played 85. ...Bb8 and offered the draw.

As my opponent was rated somewhere in between the area of equal to better than me I decided to go with an opening in which I'm really comfortable.  Comments are welcome on this game. I'm an amateur and relatively inexperienced player who has recently begun to study and play chess more seriously.

Perhaps there would have been possibilities in trying to defend it with my bishop but at the time I was concerned with staying ahead in development. I had realized that I had more developed pieces and an exchange for his DSB would facilitate my lead.
623,31,11,Qd7,b'rnb2rk1/p2q1pp1/2p4p/3p4/Np2n3/4BB2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I think this move was to forestall a pin I was going to set up with my DSB on c5. It also adds complications since our queens are facing each other.
624,31,12,1Bxe4,b'rnb2rk1/p2q1pp1/2p4p/3p4/Np2B3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I was still looking at attacking his rook anyway and wanted to get a very well placed knight off the board. Also this breaks his center.
625,31,13,1Qxd7,b'rnb2rk1/p2Q1pp1/2p4p/8/Np2p3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I wasn't sure how good of an idea a qeen swap was. I was trying to stay ahead of black and foresaw a way to fork black's rook and pawn even the material and retain my lead in development.
626,31,14,2Nc5,b'2r3k1/p2b1pp1/n1pBr2p/2N5/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',By this time I realized that though we were technically even my sets of pawns were connected while black's weren't on the queenside. I judged this as an advantage and with a lack of other plans just tried to keep initiative and trade down to where my connected pawns might prove more decisive. Plus 21. ...Nxc5 22. Bxc5 puts my bishop at a point of attack on black's pawn allowing me to keep initiative.
627,31,15,2Rd6,b'6k1/p1rb1pp1/2pRr2p/2B5/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',In keeping with my earlier idea I decided to offer a trade or exchange looking at capturing black's e pawn and again maintaining initiative.
628,31,16,2Rxe6,b'6k1/p1rb2p1/2p1R2p/2B2p2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Continuing with the trade...I was uncertain about this. It seemed a relatively neutral move beyond allowing me to continue with the freedom of attacking.
629,31,17,a5,b'2r3k1/6p1/2p1b2p/p1B2p2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - a6',It was at this point that I realized that black's bishop could take my a pawn. In the earlier couple of moves I hadn't seen this. I was just attacking and trying to get in a place where I could get black's pawns. However I was grateul I realized it in time!
630,31,18,Kf7,b'1r6/5kp1/2p1b2p/p1B2p2/P3p3/1P6/2P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I think this game is at a point where king involvement is becoming crucial. I felt my disadvantage here with how my king was placed but wasn't sure if giving up the initiative to move my king was wise. In hindsight doing this might have saved the game. I wasn't aware of how much of a liability my closed-in position would become.
631,31,19,Bd7,b'1r2k3/3b2p1/2pR3p/p1B2p2/P3p3/1P6/2P2PPP/6K1 w - -',The game felt like it was in a kind of deadlock. My only resolution was to keep on attacking and try to gain more of an advantage.
632,31,20,3Ra6,b'3r4/3bk1p1/R6p/p1p1Bp2/P1P1p3/1P6/5PPP/6K1 b - -',Here I had a moment of exultation. Finally nothing could stop me from gaining more of a lead...
633,31,21,3Bxa4,b'3r4/4k1p1/R6p/p1p1Bp2/b1P1p3/1P6/5PPP/6K1 w - -',I was stunned. I couldn't understand why my opponent offered this sacrifice unless it was to disengage my connected pawns which might have been a worthy goal.

While there's not tons of theory to learn it's perfectly solid and playable though not seen in top level chess anymore. After the usual 2.

Looks like it has to move away and Black then has a discovered check ...gxh3+ but again like before in move 34 the rook doesn't need defence as the queen-sac-and-rebirth trick is still going on on g7.

As I stated in my Club thread - I seem to be getting through my games very slowly.  The reason is my opponents have put up such a good show against me that I am trying hard to make sensible moves but it is like wading through treacle.  This game was no different. Wolfgang kept me in such a bind for a good part of the game it was unbelievable.  It took a lot of horse manoeuvring before I was able to get anywhere.  But suddenly I did and it was all over and I netted a 6.5 rating point haul over my fellow Class A opponent. He starts off with the Reti Opening which is Nf3 and I make the most popular response with 1. ..... d5."

795,39,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The Scandinavian defense is not the most popular opening but hasn't got a huge amount of opening theory compared to other openings so its quite a good surprise choice and isn't too difficult to use. It immediately questions whites presence in the centre so from move 2 they're having to think for themselves a bit.
796,39,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The other variation 2. Qxd5 leads to a totally different type of game. Annotated games with that variation may discuss it in more detail. 
797,39,2,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The most common choice anticipating 3. Nxd5 and following that with 4. c4 building a central presence. If white defends the pawn with 3. c4 black can gambit a pawn with c6 or e6 which leads to long-term problems for white. It's not really a clever idea on whites part.
798,39,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I sidestep the more normal lines. This move is more useful than it looks. I only used it once before on GK against one of my team-mate buddies nicolso. The game was drawn.
799,39,4,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Although black's lost a tempo the move f3 is a liability for white hampering their development and weakening their kingside. Sometimes it's worth losing a tempo for those sort of sweeteners.
800,39,5,c6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/1B1P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White now keeps their pawn advantage without having to play c4. Even so this gambit has merits for black.
801,39,6,Nxc6,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/qB3b2/3P4/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',For my pawn i've got a lead in development and more space to work with notably the half-open d column where i can place a rook. Whether this is worth a whole pawn is something no-one can prove for sure. But fingers crossed i can make a case for it in this game by winning.
802,39,7,bxc6,b'2kr1b1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/3P4/2N2P2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Allowing the pawn structure around your king to be broken up isn't usually a good idea but he has no pieces near my king and no open files on that side to stick rooks on. Ultimately white never really develops an opportunity to mount an effective attack on it.  I can easily move king whatshisname to the relatively safe a8 square if needed; the fact white has traded off their White sq. bishop helps its security there.

807,39,12,1Bb6,b'2kr3r/p4ppp/1bp2n2/q3pb2/3PN3/4BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',There's a few alternative moves here worth looking at. At first i thought the right move was 12. Nxe4 13. fxe4 Bxe4 to win back the pawn but then if white goes 14 Ng3! the most likely continuation is exd4 15. Bd2 d3+ 16. Kh1 dxc2 17. Qg4+ f5 Bxa5 fxg4 19. Nxe4 which means black has traded a knight for three extra pawns but with an atrocious pawn formation that aint worth it. Another is 12. Bxe4 13. fxe4 exd4 (13. Nxe4? loses to 14. Qd3! Nf6 15. Qf5+.) 14. Nxd4 Re8 15.c3 Rxe4 16. b4 Qc7 17. bxc5 Ng4 18. g3 Nxe3 which wins the pawn back for a big piece trade-off. 12. Bb6 keeps the game positional and unclear to white what they should do next.
808,39,13,1Nxf6,b'2kr3r/p4ppp/1bp2N2/q3pb2/3P4/4BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is possibly the best choice removing the threat of me winning the e pawn. A 'safe' move like 13. c3 gives me options like Nxe4 14. fxe4 bxe4 15. Rxf7 Qd5! Which gives me good chances. Who knows what else could have happened we're past the games database now. To me that feels a bit like leaving my cuddly home and going camping where for some reason certain people find it funny to spray fires with deodarent. 
809,39,14,1gxf6,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1bp2p2/q3pb2/3P4/4BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',White has also weakened my pawn structure (that becomes clear later) but on the downside i have an open g file to use at my leisure. I'd say whites last move was a double-edged sword but i dont like that cliche so i wont.
810,39,15,1Ng3,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b3p2/q1p1pb2/3P4/2P1BPN1/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White decides to abandon the defense of d4. It clearly was a handicap so letting it go is not a bad idea.
811,39,16,exd4,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b3p2/q4b2/3p4/4BPN1/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is quite clever from white because my pawn structure is worse than bad its non-existant. Five isolated pawns two of them doubled. I do though have a passed pawn which is often potentially dangerous. This game could go either way right now.
812,39,17,Qd5,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b3p2/3q1b2/3p4/5PN1/PP1B2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I don't think now is the right time for d3+ the pawn isn't that helpful on d3 and it gives white time to move their king to a safer square. And the squares on e2 and c2 are in my control already if white moves a piece there d3+ wins it with a sneaky discovered check. Instead i move the queen to a safe square on d5 where it's got plenty of options later.
813,39,18,1Kh1,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b3p2/3q1b2/3p4/5PN1/PP1B2PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',well that's the end of my sneaky discovered check. I thought white might try and start a pawn storm with a4.
814,39,19,1Be6,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b2bp2/3q4/3p4/5PN1/PP1B2PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',I decide not to allow white to trade off their knight for my bishop. I'm looking at the possibility of moving this bishop to d5 later. This justifies my decision not to play d3 aswell since that would leave the pawn more isolated.
815,39,20,1b4,b'2kr3r/p4p1p/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1p4/5PN1/P2B2PP/R2Q1R1K b - b3',here he comes. I don't see any real danger none of whites pieces are in particularly great squares although my last move does give white the choice of Ne4.
816,39,21,1h5,b'2kr3r/p4p2/1b2bp2/3q3p/1P1p4/5PN1/P2B2PP/R2Q1R1K w - h6',On the other hand i have got some pieces pointing at whites king. I reckon i've got more chances of winning now. Koolio.
817,39,22,2Ne4,b'2kr3r/p4p2/1b2bp2/3q3p/1P1pN3/5P2/P2B2PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',White threatens to both win a pawn and place the knight on c5. 
818,39,23,2h4,b'2kr3r/p4p2/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1pN2p/5P2/P2B2PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',f5 doesn't look very good to me after 21. Nc5. if i follow that with something like 21. h4 then 22. Bg5! Rd6 23. Rc1 Rc6 24. Bf6 wins the d pawn. I'd rather keep the d pawn than the f pawn so i decide to sacrifice the latter and continue my massive pawn storm on the kingside. I'm telling ya four queens couldnt stop that ferocious little devil.
819,39,24,2a3,b'3r3r/pk3p2/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1pN2p/P4P2/3B2PP/2RQ1R1K b - -',kinda pointless.. white could have played 22. Nc5+ Ka8 23. a4 which looks somewhat dangerous or a simple defensive move in h3 to end my one-man pawn charge. Whites game gradually unravels from here.
820,39,25,2h3,b'3r3r/pk3p2/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1pN3/P4P1p/3B2PP/2RQ1R1K w - -',Now i get some reward. Whites kingside defenses will be permanently damaged.
821,39,26,2g3,b'3r3r/pk3p2/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1pN3/P4PPp/3B3P/2RQ1R1K b - -',Whilst i've got no immediate threat this weakening could give me more chances later. It's worth it.
822,39,27,2Ka8,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1b2bp2/3q4/1P1pN3/P4PPp/3B3P/2RQ1R1K w - -',Enhances my kings safety i couldn't see anything better at the time. I'll now be quite happy if white grabs my pawn.
823,39,28,2Nxf6,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1b2bN2/3q4/1P1p4/P4PPp/3B3P/2RQ1R1K b - -',He does. That pawn was almost useless and in exchange i can shuffle my pack. For me that makes chess a better game than poker where shuffling poor hands doesn't do anything so you have to bluff.
824,39,29,Bd5,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1b6/3b1q2/1P1pN3/P4PPp/3B3P/2RQ1R1K w - -',I mentioned earlier i wanted to do that. The purpose now looks clearer pointing it at whites f pawn which has been weakened by white being forced to play g3.
825,39,30,d3,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1b6/2Nb1q2/1P6/P2p1PPp/3B3P/2RQ1R1K w - -',Why play d3 now? A different move like Rhe8 allows white to play 27. Na4 and trade off their knight for my bishop which i don't want. But if he tries Na4 now i can simply move the bishop to d4 and my game continues undisturbed. d3 also opens up a new threat Rhe8 followed by Re2! allowing me to win the f pawn which would be a total disaster for white. And white can't afford to move either the queen or rook from its defense. Its a thorn in whites side to use another cliche.
826,39,31,2Bf4,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1b6/2Nb1q2/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/7P/2RQ1R1K b - -',White tries to protect the f pawn. 
827,39,32,2Bc6,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1bb5/2N2q2/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/7P/2RQ1R1K w - -',I need to be patient right now i need to guard my d pawn without moving the bishop off that diagonal. Bc6 accomplishes both those things.
828,39,33,2Rf2,b'k2r3r/p4p2/1bb5/2N2q2/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/5R1P/2RQ3K b - -',White knows what's coming he'll do the best to to try and stop it.
829,39,34,2Qf1,b'k2rr3/p4p2/1bb5/2N2q2/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/5R1P/2R2Q1K b - -',Passive moves are all white can do here really. There doesn't seem to be anything much better.
830,39,35,2Qd5,b'k2rr3/p4p2/1bb5/2Nq4/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/5R1P/2R2Q1K w - -',Now Re2 will force the capture of the f pawn
831,39,36,3Rd2,b'k2rr3/p4p2/1bb5/2Nq4/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/3R3P/2R2Q1K b - -',This move delays Re2 as white could then take it with the queen.
832,39,37,3Qh5,b'k2rr3/p4p2/1bb5/2N4q/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/3R3P/2R2Q1K w - -',But now the threat's back on again and worse still i can immediately take f3 now it's lost a defender. Nothing really fancy about my little sequence there it simply takes away precious time from white.
833,39,38,3Kg1,b'k2rr3/p4p2/1bb5/2N4q/1P3B2/P2p1PPp/3R3P/2R2QK1 b - -',This is now the only defense possible as Re2? allows g4! which enables white to safely exchange rooks after black moves the queen. 
834,39,39,3Rd4,b'k3r3/p4p2/1bb5/2N4q/1P1r1B2/P2p1PPp/3R3P/2R2QK1 w - -',I could have continued with Bxf3 and still have a good position but this move is even better threatening 32. Rxf4 33. gxf4 Rg8+ which will lead to checkmate.
835,39,40,3Rxd3,b'k3r3/p4p2/1bb5/2N4q/1P1r1B2/P2R1PPp/7P/2R2QK1 b - -',Whites game is now hopeless his best chance is to accept losing their queen and hoping blacks naffs it up somehow.
836,39,41,Rd8,b'k2r4/p4p2/8/2q5/3R1B2/P4PPp/7P/3R2K1 w - -',I've now got a simple path to victory. Force a rook tradeoff and get my queen to c2 where white can't adequately deal with the checkmate threat on g2.
837,39,42,3Rd8+,b'k2R4/p4p2/8/8/8/P3BPPp/2q4P/6K1 b - -',White launches a couple of delaying checks.
838,39,43,Qh1,b'8/p4p2/2k5/8/8/P3BPPp/3R1K1P/7q w - -',White can't prevent me winning their h pawn and then making mine my new queen. After its brave and important endeavures it has earned it.
839,39,44,4Bf4,b'8/p4p2/2k5/8/5B2/P4PPp/3R1K1P/7q b - -',Whites last stand he hopes black will forget to take this turn so he can defend it next time. Better late than never does not really apply in this situation.
840,39,45,h2,b'8/p4p2/2k5/8/5B2/P4PP1/3K3p/8 w - -',And there it is it's all over. I found it quite an interesting and competitive game to annotate and well played white who didn't appear to do a lot wrong. Hope you enjoyed it see you around maybe..
