116,2,19,Ndxf2,b'6k1/p4pp1/1r5p/2p5/6nN/PB4P1/2P2n1P/3R2K1 w - -',This endgame liquidation is slightly better for White but very close to equality
117,2,20,Ne3,b'3R4/p4B1k/3N1r1p/2p3p1/8/P3n1P1/2P2n1P/6K1 w - -',36. ...Ne5 may have gave Black an advantage

119,3,0,b3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I haven't often played against this variant but it seems to pay off well. The threats black normally has are neutralized through the exchange so that white has time to set up a powerful fianchetto.
120,3,1,Bg4,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bqp3/6b1/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I am trying to retain control over d4 so it can't be played by white to grab space.
121,3,2,Bh5,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bqp2b/8/1P3N1P/PBPPBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is a mistake as white will expertly demonstrate. 10....Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Qe6 leaves white with a rather powerful bishop pair but white has a slight advantage in the centre and plenty of space for counterplay and could potentially look to set up a pawn storm on the king side after positioning his rooks on the e- and d-file.
122,3,3,Bxe2,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bqN3/8/1P5P/PBPPbPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Looking back I was a bit too afraid of giving up the bishop pair to white in such an open position since Nxe5 looks a little better to me now.
123,3,4,Qxd2,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2b1N3/8/1P5P/PBPqQPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Too eager to win back the pawn. Playing 12....c6 allows white to defend with Nf3 but then at least the centre is mine after 12....Re8 giving at least some compensation for the pawn albeit likely insufficient.
124,3,5,Bxf2+,b'1k1N1r2/ppp3pp/2n5/8/6Q1/1P5P/PBPq1bP1/R4RK1 w - -',Trying to poke back but the game is pretty much lost now.
125,3,6,Qxc2,b'1k1r4/ppp3pp/2n5/8/6Q1/1P5P/PBq2bP1/3R1R1K w - -',And now white seals the deal with a swift combination.
126,3,7,2Rc1,b'1k1n4/pppQ2pp/8/8/7b/1P5P/PBq3P1/2R4K b - -',And black resigns. Like I said it was a rather sloppy match on my part but hopefully there was still some educational value in the annotation perhaps mostly from the excellent way in which white managed to punish me.
127,4,0,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Typical French setup. White has grabbed a bit more space which constricts the movement of the black pieces but the centre pawns of white are also easily contested which is what black will try to exploit in order to get to a middle game in which his e- and d-pawn will be free to march onward and create a lot of danger in the white position. I often struggle against this opening so French experts may find my play rather inaccurate.
128,4,1,Nge2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Already inaccurate? I noticed in de GK database that b4 is the conventional move here after which black takes either pawn and white can gain it back at some point after playing 7. Nb5. The played move quickly leads to some trouble with my centre.
129,4,2,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/b2pP3/3N4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Maybe f4 would have done a better job of maintaining the centre here although the threat of Nc6 with d5 upon retreat and a monster of a centre after exchange. Maybe the best solution would be b4 followed by f4?
130,4,3,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/b2pP3/8/P1N2N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Any exchange at c6 will lead to an extremely powerful centre for black along with a half open b-file which I feared would create too much play for black. After 9. Bb5 a6 would follow and I would be forced into the unwanted exchange.
131,4,4,1Ne4,b'r1bqk2r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/b3P3/3pN3/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"This cuts off my influence over g6 and prevents my queen from being capable of covering e5 pretty much dooming e5. However the knight occupies a very active square on e4 and I decided I would much rather position all my pieces nicely rather than desperately hanging on to the pawn while awkwardly placing all my pieces

Therefore I invest my time into positioning my pieces more agressively. Black will most likely castle short some time soon now and at that point I will have all of my pieces eagerly jumping the king side. This knight moce adds to that effect both because the knight becomes more agressive ths way and opens up my position to facilitate Qh5 and f4.
133,4,6,1f4,b'r1bqk2r/1pb1nppp/p3p3/4n1N1/3pNP2/P2B4/1PPB2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq f3',grabs some space

Maybe black was not interested in offering up the c-file?
135,4,8,1O-O,b'r1bqk2r/1pb1nppp/p3p1n1/6N1/3pNP2/P2B4/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',conveniently defends f4

I couldn't fully calculate everything from here but I felt that if I wanted anything out of this game it would have to be through an attack given that I am down material but have my pieces exquisitely positioned at his king. Holding out on this move would allow black to play h6 which would complicate my attacking options.
137,4,10,1Bb4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pb1npp1/p3p1n1/7Q/1B1pNP2/P2B4/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',This move is important as it makes it harder for black to create an escape route for his king... At least that was my thinking during the game. The GK computer analysis strongly disagrees and calls this move a blunder. The proper defense against this move will be outlined later in this annotation. I myself considered the strong defense a sign that the initial sacrifice of the knight was wrong but the GK computer considers THIS to be the blunder giving white an advantage of 0.41 after the following line (I do not fully understand it myself but it's posted here so it may be discussed): 17. Ng5 Re8 18. g4 Ba5 19. f5 exf5 20. gxf5 Bxf5 21. Nxf7 Bxd2 22. Nxd8 Bxd3 23. cxd3 Raxd8 24. Qg4 Kh8 25. Qh5+ Bh6

While black's position was not particularly easy to defend there seems to be a solution to it. Since the lines are not forced there are a lot of options so I guess we might first consider the less reasonable ones before coming to the one that appears the strongest and was suggested by the GK computer. The knight on g6 can not move because of Nf6 xf6 Qh7#For this reason neither Bxf4 nor Nxf4 is an option. Removing the pin on the knight by playing 17....Re8 seems to be too slow because of 18. f5 leading to for example A) 18....Nxf5 19. g4 Nh6 20. Rxf7 Nxf7 21. Qxg6 Bd6 22. Nxd6 Nxd6 23. Qh7 Kf7 24. Rf1 Nf5 25. xf5  Qg5 26. Kh1 with a very vulnerable king for black B) 18....Nf4 19. Rxf4 Bxf4 20. Nf6 xf6 21. xe6 xe6 22. Qh7 Kf8 23. Bg6 or C) 18....xf5 19. Bc4 Be6 20. Bxe6 xe6 21. Ng5 Nf8 22. Qf7 Kh8 23. Rf3 Ng8 24. Qh5 Nh6 25. Nh7. While none of these lines are forced and I may have missed something it seems like it is very hard to defend after 17....Re8. The correct defense is therefore to immediately move the knight on e7 to a better defensive position. From the GK computer: 17....Nd5 18. Ng5 Nf6 19. Qh3 Bd6 20. Bxg6 fxg6 21. Bxd6 Qxd6 and white basically simply stays a full piece behind. I may myself have opted for 17....Nd5 18. Bxf8 but at that point the attack will also mostly have died down and two pieces for a rook is generally not a very favourable trade.

I am sorry for the giant walls of text and (most likely) the need for a chess board to follow all the lines. I hope you still enjoyed the annotation and found the game interesting. If someone could tell me if there is a way to better edit the text so I can make paragraphs rather than big walls of text I could maybe make this even a bit more readable. 
140,5,0,dxc6,b'r1b1kbnr/1pq1pppp/p1p5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',black interestingly decides to take back away from the centre which allows him to develop his light-squared bishop more quickly but also allows white to set up a fianchetto at the a1-h8 diagonal and get a strong centre. 
141,5,1,Qxf3,b'r3kbnr/1pq1pppp/p1p5/2p5/4P3/1P3Q2/PBPP1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',It is not really clear to me why black would seek to make this trade nor why he would necessarily do it right now. This allows white to develop his queen 'for free'
142,5,2,f6,b'r3kbnr/1pq3pp/p1p2p2/2p1p3/4P3/1P4Q1/PBPP1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',further restricting the power of the dark squared bishop.
143,5,3,1d3,b'r3kbnr/1pq3pp/p1p2p2/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P2Q1/PBP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',as the a1-h8 diagonal is important to gain control over the centre I want to develop my knight outside of it
144,5,4,1Qg4+,b'2kr1bnr/1pq3pp/p1p2p2/2p1p3/4P1Q1/1P1P4/PBP2PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',At this point my short term strategic goal would be to create a passed pawn in the centre. Therefore I want to makew room for g3 and f4. 
145,5,5,1Qe2,b'1k1r1bnr/1pq3p1/p1p2p2/2p1p2p/4P3/1P1P2P1/PBP1QP1P/RN3RK1 b - -',Queen now moves back to safety to prevent black can use little attacks at the queen to further his king side attack 
146,5,6,1Qd7,b'1k1r1bnr/1p1q2p1/p1p2p2/2p1p2p/4P3/1P1P2P1/PBP1QP1P/RN3RK1 w - -',Black leaves the way open for white to play f4. Preventing it would have been an option with 13.... Bd6 but this could haev been fought with Nd2-c4 and if black would want to prevent that with 14....b5 white gets a nice new point of attack by going for opening up the a-file with 15. a4
147,5,7,1Nd2,b'1k1r1bnr/1p1q2p1/p1p2p2/2p5/4PP1p/1P1P4/PBPNQ2P/R4RK1 b - -',e5 won't easily be stopped so finishing development before opening up the position seems prudent.
148,5,8,fxe5,b'1k1r1bn1/1p1q2p1/p1p3r1/2p1p3/5P1p/1P1P4/PBPNQ2P/R4R1K w - -',Black has an interesting choice here between 18....f5 and 18....xe5. The former leaves a passed pawn that is supported by another pawn but the chosen move allows white to get very active pieces along the f-file. The fact that f5 also blocks black's access to the king side may be the deciding factor in favor of the played move.
149,5,9,1fxe5,b'1k1r1bn1/1p1q2p1/p1p3r1/2p1P3/7p/1P1P4/PBPNQ2P/R4R1K b - -',The short term goal has been reached. Now white should aim to generate active pieces around the passed pawn while black should make sure the pawn will be blocked until the end game is reached and the king might be able to collect it.
150,5,10,2Nf3,b'1k2rbn1/1p1q2p1/p1p3r1/2p1P3/7p/1P1P1N2/PBP1Q2P/R4R1K b - -',Strong defense of the pawn will make sure no pieces are tied down to its defense and keeps the pieces fluid enough to move to more active squares at opportune moments.
151,5,11,2Rfg1,b'1k2rbn1/1p1q2p1/p1p3r1/2p1P3/8/1P1P1N1p/PBP1Q2P/R5RK b - -',the weak square g2 must be protected.
152,5,12,2Rh6,b'1k2rbn1/1p1q2p1/p1p4r/2p1P3/8/1P1P1N1p/PBP1Q2P/R5RK w - -',exchange may have been better as white now gets two very active rooks
153,5,13,2Raf1,b'1k2rbn1/1p1q2p1/p1p4r/2p1P3/8/1P1P1N1p/PBP1Q2P/5RRK b - -',getting the other rook involved in the game
154,5,14,2Ng5,b'1k2rb2/1p1q2p1/p1p2n1r/2p1P1N1/8/1P1P3p/PBP1Q2P/5RRK b - -',I had no good place to move the queen to in order to take away the pin on the e-pawn so this move serves the dual purpose of creating more space for the queen and making the knight more active.
155,5,15,2Ne4,b'1k2rb2/1p1q2pn/p1p4r/2p1P3/4N3/1P1P3p/PBP1Q2P/5RRK b - -',White would like to play for Rf7 in this position instead but after 24. Rf7 Re7 25. e6 Qd5+ it feels like I am not really making any progress and I have simply weakened my position. Retreating to e4 also makes no direct progress but at least I still have rather active pieces especially compared to black's bishop and knight.
156,5,16,2Qg4,b'1k3b2/1p1q2pn/p1p1r2r/2p1P3/4N1Q1/1P1P3p/PBP4P/5RRK b - -',I this position it may have been better to try to relocate the bishop via c1 especially considering that it may be done while attacking the awkwardly placed h6 rook now but that black will likely attempt to make some trades later on.
157,5,17,2Qe8,b'1k2qb2/1p4pn/p1p1r2r/2p1P3/4N1Q1/1P1P3p/PBP4P/5RRK w - -',covers g6 but takes away the option of getting to d5 to take advantage of the problematic diagonal h1-d5.
158,5,18,2Ng3,b'1k2qb2/1p4pn/p1p1r2r/2p1P3/6Q1/1P1P2Np/PBP4P/5RRK b - -',The knight can now move away from the diagonal and get to the strong square f5
159,5,19,2Qf4,b'1k2q3/1p2b1pn/p1p3rr/2p1PN2/5Q2/1P1P3p/PBP4P/5RRK b - -',This places the queen in the same diagonal with the king. This slightly limits black's options but creating a direct counter threat with Qf3 hitting h3 might have been more forceful. 
160,5,20,3Nxe7,b'1k2q3/1p2N1pn/p1p3r1/2p1P3/5Q2/1P1P3p/PBP4P/6RK b - -',Given the tempi that black can create (either through check at g1 or with a mate threat on g2 after 31. Kxg6 Qxg6) this only leads to simple exchanges. At the moment I considered this reasonable as I expected to win the pawn on h3 but as we will see later this isn't very valuable so avoiding the exchange altogether with 30. Rf1 in order to create danger through the f-file and by pushing the e-pawn onward. Nxg7 could also have created some more danger as it would mean that the h-pawn is actually crucially important since subsequently losing that would mean white gets an extra passed pawn. As it was played the position looked less and less winable.
161,5,21,3Qf5,b'1k6/1p2q1pn/p1p5/2p1PQ2/8/1P1P3p/PBP4P/6K1 b - -',32. e6+ Kf8 33. Qg4 looks a bit more interesting as after 34.... Qg5 35. Qxg5 Nxg5 36. Bxg7 Nxe6 white should be able to create a passed pawn on the h-file which leaves him very much a favourite to win and after 35....Ng5 the exchange can also occur because after 36. Bxg7 Qxg7 is not allowed because of 37. e7+ Kc7 (38. e8Q+ after either Ne6 or Kc8) 38. e8N+. Of course 32. e6+ may also be answered with Kh8 or Kh7 but in that case white can respond with Qe5 which will again most likely lead to an exchange between e6 and g7 with the added benefit that the blck king is now in a less active position making the white end game a little bit better.
162,5,22,3Qg5+,b'1k6/1p4pn/p1p5/2p1PQq1/8/1P1P3p/PBP4P/6K1 w - -',Black is mostly playing for a draw and the less pieces are on the board the easier it will be to create blockades for the passed pawn.
163,5,23,Ne6,b'1k6/1p4p1/p1p1n3/2p1P3/8/1P1P3p/PBP2K1P/8 w - -',Now black's problems all seem resolved. He is about to lose the pawn on h3 but white can not easily find progress so black may very well be able to play this towards a draw now.
164,5,24,3Kxh3,b'8/1pk3p1/p1p1n3/2p1P3/8/1P1P3K/PBP4P/8 b - -',While white is now a pawn ahead how can he turn this into a win? The knight on e6 seems to perfectly block everything.
165,5,25,3h4,b'8/1p2k1p1/p1p1n3/2p1P3/6KP/1P1P4/PBP5/8 b - h3',To control g5 but it would probably have been better to play Kf5 first. The king can be forced away by 38... Kf7 39. h4 g6 but at that point the king can move to e5 which would be better since it has no real purpose on the locked up king side.
166,5,26,3c3,b'8/1p2k3/p1p1n1p1/2p1P3/6KP/1PPP4/PB6/8 b - -',takes away d4 as a potential square for the knight 
167,5,27,4b4,b'8/1p3k2/p1p1n1p1/2p1P3/1P4KP/2PP4/PB6/8 b - -',After the exchange white can try to move his king towards e4 and then try to move up the d-pawn to attempt to get the king behind the ranks. It still seems rather drawish but I couldn't find a better line either.
168,5,28,c5,b'8/1p3k2/p3n1p1/2p1P3/1P4KP/3P4/PB6/8 w - -',This seems to make things unnecessarily easy for white. The trade creates two connected passed panws. More resilient would have been 41...b5 which locks down the position with all of black's pawns on light squares where they are invaulnerable to the white bishop. At that point white might try to get behind enemy lines with the king through e4 and abusing zugzwang. I am not entirely certain that it will actually lead to a win unequivocally or that it is a theoreticl draw and I merely misplayed the following variations. In any case b5 would certainly allow white to mess up.
169,5,29,4d5,b'8/5k2/pp4p1/3PP3/6KP/2Bn4/P7/8 b - -',Black resigns. Although the material is equal and there are no direct threats the two connected passed pawns that white has at his disposal will most likely be able to secure the win by tying down the knight and the king preventing them to reach the 8th row which means for example that g6 will most likely fall. 
170,6,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Here I wanted to play Nc3 first. I had f4 in mind but wanted to delay it. 
171,6,1,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq d6',Here I could exchange on d5 first and then play Bb5 having e4 square for my Knight after d4 but i wanted center to be closed and didnt see any problem about Ne2. Thus I played the next move 5-Bb5 
172,6,2,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/3pPP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',i would love it if my opponent exchanged on e4 but as i said earlier i expected this and it was ok.
173,6,3,a6,b'r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1n1p3/1Bp5/3pPP2/5N2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',My Bishop is there to exchange the Knight for a Bishop. I waited till this move in order not to lose a tempo.
174,6,4,1Qe1,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p1b1pn2/2p5/3pPP2/3P1N2/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Ne5 would be even better. But Qe1 is also a good move I am aiming for g3 or h4 square for my Queen.
175,6,5,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/1p2bppp/p1b1pn2/2p1N3/3pPP2/3P4/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Now Ne4 is a good move it is hard to get rid of Knight from that square and it is like an octopus there.
176,6,6,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/1pq1bppp/p1b1pn2/2p1N3/3pPP2/3P4/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq -',Obviously my opponent did not want me to ruin his pawn structure after the exchange on c6.
177,6,7,1Nxc6,b'r3k2r/1pq1bppp/p1N1pn2/2p5/3pPP2/3P4/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',A very bad move. Just as I said earlier Knight was too strong and the Bishop was not as effective cause of my e4 pawn. I thought I could play h3 followed by e5 and kick the Knight to bad position and later use e4 my other Knight. the problem is that I did not think the fact that when i play e5 I leave the d5 square for his knight. Thus i regretted this move already in a second.
178,6,8,h5,b'r3k2r/1p2bpp1/p1q1pn2/2p4p/3pPP2/3P3P/PPP1N1P1/R1B1QRK1 w kq h6',My opponent does not want to allow me to play g4 but it was not my thought. Apart from that this move weakens his kingside.  But still his king is in the center and can go both sides. 
179,6,9,1c3,b'r3k2r/1p2bpp1/p1q1pn2/2p4p/3pPP2/2PP3P/PP2N1P1/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',I played this move to open up the c file. In case his king decides to go queenside this might be a problem. 
180,6,10,1Rd8,b'3rk2r/1p2bpp1/p1q1pn2/2p4p/3pPP2/2PP3P/PP2N1P1/R1B1QRK1 w k -',Here I think my opponent did an inaccuracy. I could simply exchange on d4 and maybe later play  b3 and somehow Bb2 followed by Rc1. That would be devastating. Bishop would be too strong on diagonal and Rook on c1 would be extremely well placed. But i didnt bother thinking about that strategy it is the bad side of playing 5 min chess on the net. So i followed the previous strategy: play c4 followed by e5 then his knight has no good squares and my knight has e4.

So i played Qg3 somehow forcing my opponent to play g6 and weakening dark squares there...

189,6,19,h4,b'3r1r2/4bpk1/1nq3p1/2p1PR2/ppPpN2p/1P1P2QP/P5PK/R1B5 w - -',Here Qf4 would finish the game. Cause after gxf5 white has Nf6 followed by Qh6 black cannot avoid mate. I played an automatic move despite having around 1 hour on the clock.

In this moment i saw the previous move would finish the game and i regretted it. Here I calculated Bh6 but had a funny lil mistake on calculation and played a bad move.

194,7,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The most agressive line in the Scandinavian. It may be that this line should be considered ´incorrect´ but at my level I am unlikely to encounter opponents that can actually prove this and there are seceral lines that can lead to very agressive and tactically interesting games.
195,7,1,Bxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Icelandic variation. At this point it is unlikely that black will regain his pawn soon but the head start in development often leads to quick control over the central files so that white will have to deal with a lot of pressure.
196,7,2,Qe7,b'rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Maybe not the best. The idea of course is to set up the discovered check by taking the c-pawn but white now gets the chance to build up a solid defense by blocking the e-file with Be3 leaving little play for black in exchange for the sacrifice pawn. A more agressive option would have been 6.... Ne4
197,7,3,Be2,b'rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Not the best defense. While it blocks the discovered check black can still take on c4 because the bishop that was defending it is now pinned. A balancing factor to all this is that taking on c4 merely equalizes material and that white will regain his slight advantage in the development because black needs to make so many moves with his bishop. However the c-pawn is also rather important because once it is gone the d-pawn can no longer count on support from fellow pawns and will therefore likely become a prey for black in the future.
198,7,4,Ngxe2,b'rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/1b1P4/2N1B3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The exchange allowed white to develop quickly. A better idea may have been Bd5 as the most likely line that would follow is development of the knight towards f3 (either directly or through exchange of the bishop on f3) which would leave the knight on c3 weaker and more susceptible to moves like Ne4
199,7,5,Ng4,b'rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/8/8/1b1P2n1/2N1B3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',In hindsight this is a rather weird move. Of course I pressure e3 but Qd3 is an excellent defense and that's most likely where white would want to place it anyway. Simply furthering development through Nc6 and then castling on either side would have been more solid.
200,7,6,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2n5/8/1b1P2n1/2NQB3/PP2NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',immediately posts the rook where it needs to be and the asymmetric castling makes it all the more likely that the game will become dynamic and interesting.
201,7,7,h5,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2nb4/7p/3P2n1/P1NQB1P1/1P2NP1P/R4RK1 w - h6',trying to put pressure on the freshly created weakness in the king's position.

204,7,10,Rxd4,b'2k4r/ppp1q1p1/2n2p2/7p/3r1NnP/P1NQ2P1/1P3P2/R4RK1 w - -',I could not resist the promiss of winning a pawn but perhaps it would have been better to continue the project of opening the h-file via 15...g5
205,7,11,Rhd8,b'2kr4/pppr2p1/2n2p2/7p/5NnP/P1N3P1/1P3P2/3R1RK1 w - -',Thoughtless. There wasn't really a good reason to give up a pawn at this point. g5 to poke away the knight before the moving the rook on h8 would probably have been better. If black would trade rooks at d7 he would momentarily gain control over the d-file which benefits him to some extent but this close to the endgame the extra pawn is probavly worth fighting for.
206,7,12,Rd2,b'2k5/ppp3p1/2n2p2/7N/6nP/P1N3P1/1P1r1P2/5RK1 w - -',Once again an attempt to save the pawn through 21... g6 22. Nf4 Nce5 could well be better although in this case white could follow that up with forcing the rook trade leaving  a rather equal knight end game regardless.
207,7,13,Nge5,b'2k5/ppp3N1/2n2p2/4n3/7P/P1N2PP1/1r6/5RK1 w - -',f3 is actually rather weakening since I threaten to set up an attack and 24. f4 leads to Ng4 blocking the march of the white passed pawns.
208,7,14,2Rf2,b'2k5/ppp3N1/5p2/4n3/3nN2P/P4PP1/1r3R2/6K1 b - -',25 Nxf6 was not allowed because of 25...Nxf3 26. Rxf3 (Kh1 Rh2#) Nxf3 
209,7,15,Rb3,b'2k5/ppp3N1/5p2/8/3nN2P/Pr3nP1/5RK1/8 w - -',In hindsight I don't really like this move. I considered I might be able to block the white's pawns with my knights so I wanted to create three connected passed pawns to force the issue. However as we will see later white's rook becomes an important tool to cut off my king from the king side. Therefore 26...Rxf2 27.Kxf2 f5 followed with rushing my king to the king side to catch white's passed pawn was likely better.
210,7,16,2Nd2,b'2k5/ppp3N1/5p2/8/3n3P/Pr3nP1/3N1RK1/8 b - -',Excellent move by white that I had overlooked. the trade is forced and immediately places the white rook firmly on the d-file cutting my king off from any potential interference with his h-pawn.
211,7,17,Nc6,b'2k5/ppp3N1/2n2p2/8/7P/Pr4P1/3R2K1/8 w - -',On its way to e5 from where it will have access to both g6 and f7 for control over h8
212,7,18,Nf7,b'2k5/ppp2nN1/5p1P/8/8/Pr4P1/3R2K1/8 w - -',Chosen over g6 as it would be more easily protected by the king here (e.g. 31. Rf2 Kd7 32. Rxf6 Ke7) but g6 would have been a foil to white's following move (to some extent at least)
213,7,19,b6,b'2k5/p1p2n2/1p3p1P/5N2/8/Pr4P1/3R2K1/8 w - -',It is a necessity to create some breating space for the king since white threatens to push the king with Ne7. While white cannot checkmate at d8 because of the knight on f7 black would still rather not be forced to place his king on b8 as it would allow for overloading the defensive responsibilities of the knight threatening both Rd8 and h8Q
214,7,20,3Rd8,b'3R4/pkp1Nn1P/1p3p2/8/8/r5P1/6K1/8 b - -',As previously stated the knight has too many defensive responsibilities at this point so it can't afford to take the rook. White's approach here is quite interesting. Of course he is piling on the pressure right now but he also moves his rook away from the second row where it was crucially protecting his king. As we will see this seals the fate of the game. Another option white had was to keep his rook as a defense to his king and play Ng6. This would allow him to trade his h-pawn for the black knight. At that point the game would become a race between the three connected passed pawns for black and the single passed pawn (black's f-pawn is likely not going to hold out much longer after the knight is taken) that is supported by an additional piece. I have not looked into this end game very thoroughly so I can't really say if Rd8 would be a mistake as it throws away a won endgame or rather a great way to force the draw but it is certainly interesting to play out the more daring option of 34. Ng6 a few times as an end game training.
215,7,21,3Kg2,b'3R4/pkp1Nn1P/1p3p2/8/8/6P1/6K1/r7 b - -',A draw is agreed as repetition of moves is now unavoidable. The white king needs to make sure he prevents the black rook from taking control over the h-file since that would cost him his most important pawn. At the same time black needs to keep 'trying' to do just that as he would otherwise allow white to play Rf8 winning the knight. Overall the game seemed like a bit of a back and forth between two parties that both obtained small advantages during it but could never properly capitalize on these advantages and ultimately both ended up conceding them to the other player. At least studying the game revealed some subtleties that might be learned from in order to be able to turn small advantages into a win next time.
216,8,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Oh joy an opening I wasn't familiar with. I kept calm and thought it trough. Either he's gonna play d4 or fianchetto. In both cases I want to play d5. Either to go into some strange queen pawn opening the opening I'm most familiar with ( d4 d5 is my openingrepertoire as white ) or I make his white Bishop a tiny bit less powerful by blocking that diagonal.
217,8,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Please for the love of .... just play d4 so I can actually go into theory lines I'm familiar with.

219,8,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Perhaps I should have waited with bringing my knight out. Maybe Bishop f5 and then Knight from b8 to d7 would have been better. No point in thinking about it now my opponent is  over 1750 elo it'd surprise me if he didn't know the theory behind both knight moves.
220,8,4,d3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Preparing to bring his bishop out and planning e4.

222,8,6,Nbd2,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',His position is something I'd expect to see from black not something from white. The e4 square is being targeted once again and he's preparing to eventually bring his knight to b3 I suppose.
223,8,7,Bc5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2bp1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',If I had played e5 then theory suggests d6 would have been a better square. Well I'm not following the main lines anyway. I figured I'd prevent a shove of the f2 pawn in the future. This might be a mistake since Knight b3 might follow costing me a tempo but I figured he'd lost the tempo when playing knight d2 anyway.
224,8,8,c3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2bp1b2/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',And here the fun starts oh jeebus christ. d4 is obvious but it'd make my bishop a rather funny looking piece. I didn't feel like my bishop would do well on d6 so I decide to play it differently.
225,8,9,e5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bppb2/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',And for this reason I should have played e5 immediately. So this kind of BS isn't in his plans to begin with.
226,8,10,Nxe5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpNb2/8/2PP2P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I'll be painfully honest here I didn't see this combination when I played e5. What looks like losing a knight is actually opening the centre. 
227,8,11,d4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpnb2/3P4/2P3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Now there're 3 options. Option A take the pawn with my bishop and win back the material option B move my knight to d7 or option C: move my bishop to d6 he takes i take back. I didn't really consider option B and option C didn't feel right. I can't really tell you why it just felt wrong. Perhaps because I valued my Knight so much. I know bishops are usually better in an endgame but I felt like I needed the knight to prevent losing the centre.
228,8,12,1Nf3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',This move surprised me I was expecting Knight b3. Maybe because he wants to make his knight an attacking piece when I castle.
229,8,13,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/P4NP1/1P2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',??? I didn't understand this move. I guess he wants to do a minority attack on the queen side but with 2 pawns and no minor pieces? Maybe he wanted to prevent Knight b4 followed by Knight c2 I guess that must be it. Since then I'd get a nasty attack going after he moves his Rook. I wonder if he could have prevented that combination if he didn't immediately play a3.

But there's no fun in that if you're up versus a titan then escaping with your life is good but imagine if you actually kill said titan. BAM you're a local hero. ( Not really but you get my point.

Maybe not the brightest choice versus someone of his caliber. Another option would have been Re7 he takes I recapture. And the material is once again dead even however enabling the d4 pawn will get quite a bit easier. He'd play something like Qb3 force my knight back to b6 start pushing his pawns on the d line and eventually he'll get of an attack with his bishop on my queen.

406,13,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Interesting response for a King's Gambit.  I'd never seen this one before so decided to have a little fun.  This move opens up the king to potential check down the road depending upon moves made.  By making this move Black is exposing his King in order for faster development.
407,13,2,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now my pawn on the f file is poised to support my Queen assault Black's King.

409,13,4,fxg6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/6P1/7Q/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Now Black has some potentially ugly choices to make.  The game is far from lost but White is in the driver's seat.
410,13,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp3p/5nP1/7Q/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Not a bad move.  I actually like Qe7+ better.  It allows Black to get the Queen into the game with a tempo move and opens up more possibilities down the road.
411,13,6,g7+,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2Pp/5n2/7Q/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I don't know if Black expected this move as a response but sacrificing a Queen (momentarily) in total allows me to trade a pawn for a Rook all while getting a new Queen.
412,13,7,gxh8=Q,b'rnbqkb1Q/pppp3p/8/7n/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQq -',Now I am up 5 pts and have a Queen in Black's backfield.  Black needs to attack early and often to make up the difference.
413,13,8,Qh4+,b'rnb1kb1Q/pppp3p/8/7n/5p1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQq -',This line of attack seeks parity by offering the same trick that White used against Black.  If White parries with g3 the same situation will arise that just played out a few moves ago.  I still like Qe7+ better here.  If White isn't careful that move can work towards trapping White's Queen.
414,13,9,Kd1,b'rnb1kb1Q/pppp3p/8/7n/5p1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBK1BNR b q -',Discretion being the counterpoint to valor White flees.
415,13,10,d5,b'rnb1kb1Q/ppp4p/8/3p3n/5p1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBK1BNR w q d6',I categorize this move as a blunder.  Far better to do d6.  It's a good idea to get the LSB into the game on g4 to provide some much needed pressure to White's exposed King but by moving to d5 Black allows White's Queen to get back into the game.  If d6 instead then the next move for Black would be Nf3.  Although that threatens Black's Queen it doesn't allow White to get their Queen back into the game for free plus giving up a pawn.
416,13,11,Kd8,b'rnbk1b2/ppp4p/8/3pQ2n/5p1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBK1BNR w - -',It's possible Kf7 is better to allow Black's Rook easier egress.
417,13,12,Qe7,b'rnbk4/ppp1q2p/3b4/3Q3n/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBK1B1R w - -',I would have considered Bg4 first.  That way you would have had the added benefit of protecting the Knight on h5
418,13,13,Bd7,b'r2k4/pppbq2p/2nb4/1B5Q/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBK3R w - -',Blocking here is the only feasible choice.  If you move the knight out of the way to a5 perhaps Re1 is just a crushing play.
419,13,14,Qg7,b'r2k4/pppb2qp/2nb4/1B5Q/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBKR3 w - -',When you're down big trade pawns not pieces.  Down 9 Black is in a big-time hole.  This move allows White to force a Queen trade.
420,13,15,1Nf7+,b'r2k4/1pp2N1p/p1bb4/8/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBKR3 b - -',Allowing a trade... All White has to do to win is trade pieces on even terms.

Attacking the knight with Re1 is also no good as it is followed by 32... Rxg2 33.Kh1 Rf2 34. Rxe3 c2 35. Re1 Rxf3 36. Kg2 (any other move would allow white to play Rf2 making promotion of the c-pawn inevitable) Rxd3 37.Rc1 Rc3 with what looks like a very favourable endgame for black as he gets to move the king towards white's pawns while white has to make an effort to take out the c-pawn."

Better would have been Rd2 as white would still be unable to take on c3 because of Rd1# If white moves the king to remove the threat of checkmate c2 can be played after which Rd1 and promotion become inevitable. 34. Nc4 can be answered with Nxc4 35.xc4 c2 with once again unstoppable promotion. The sturdiest defense seems to be 34. Nf3 Rf2 35. Nd4 c2 36.Nb3 preventing Rd2. This seems to hold the position for white but the fact that white's king remains 'locked up' makes this position in black's favour I believe.

Kf5 doesn't help because you will be left with either a pawn on the side of the board or a pawn ahead of the king both of which can be defended and taking the pawn will also lead to a position where neither of the black pawns will be able to end the game

Where you could improve on is spotting combinations and tactics. You missed two killer ones on move 14. and 17. After this your opponent rebounded and turned thing on your head. The real turning point was when you unnecessarily offered the queen exchange. This gave your opponent the upper hand in center and queen side. Also take note how you survived as you continued to play actively and set problems for your opponent(we call this counter play) who lacked the endgame knowledge to put you to bed.

This game shows that if you play someone hard start with random moves and sack pieces. This confuses your opponent as they don't know how to combat it.

Yea. 

The problem is if she hasn't seen much of it I've probably seen none of it. Brilliant.

In reality the move I make typically is the silly one and almost always gets me in more trouble faster than I anticipated. Such is this game - and the previous game (let's just call them practice for this game) - which I did not annotate because of how embarrassing (one 26 moves the other 9).

The Be2 move above is one I am quite proud of. In fact with a +0.31 computer calculated advantage this turns out to be the peak of my game. While annotating this game I was so thrilled with my performance thus far I took a picture of it with my iPhone for future reference. Basking in the glory of the bishop opening move.

762,25,0,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black wastes no time with prophylactic moves like ...a6 launching straight into a Dragon formation.

764,25,2,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I had three main thoughts when making this move: 1. to set up long term pressure on f7; 2. to help defend my eventually castled King; 3. not to occupy e2 which I anticipated would be needed by one of my knights.  I think this worked quite well even though I did eventually lose.  I couldn't see any significant benefit in advancing to b5 now that Black had already castled.
765,25,3,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',This inhibits any thoughts White may have of advancing his e pawn and more importantly helps Black to develop his LSB.

768,25,6,1O-O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',I was already having doubts about my strategy as Black was obviously going to exploit the half-open c-file and eventually create further threats with his fianchettoed B but at this stage I thought he was equally well placed to attack a kingside castled position and I could soon launch my kingside attack.
769,25,7,1Qa5,b'r4rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/q3n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Black immediately develops his Q aggressivel.y

Now expecting to need to retreat the Nd4 to e2 in order to defend the Nc3 I mistakenly moved this rook to the f-file to over-defend the f-pawn so that I could play Ne2 with impunity.  Unfortunately Black soon demonstrated that I had more important things to worry about and that the rook was needed on the d-file.  I couldn't afford this waste of tempi.
773,25,11,1Nc4,b'r1r3k1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/q7/2nNP1P1/1BN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2K2R1R w - -',! I'd missed this response.  Now I must either give up my LSB for the N or allow it to swap with my DSB which I had planned to use for my attack.
774,25,12,Qc5,b'r1r3k1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/2q5/3NP1P1/1BN1QP2/PPP4P/2K2R1R w - -',! Another strong move that threatens to win my N with ...e5! as it will be pinned against my defenceless Q.  It also creates a battery on the c-file and gets out of the way of Black's a and b pawns which are poised to storm White's position and harrass the defending minor pieces.

At this stage although I was disappointed that I hadn't been able to discomfit Black in any way I still felt that my position was tenable with careful play.

Having weighed up my defensive options I decided to stay put and not create any further weaknesses in my castled position (eg by playing 17.a3) but revert to plan A and dislodge his N before it could join his attack.  I was also thinking of advancing my f-pawn and didn't want to leave the g-pawn hanging if I did so.  Unfortunately there is an undesired consequence of forcing the N to move ...
778,25,16,1Nh5,b'r1r3k1/p2bppbp/3p2p1/1pq3Pn/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPPQ3P/2K2R1R w - -',The good thing was that I'd persuaded the N to the rim where it became a spectator.  The bad things were that now my Nd4 was under immediate attack and I couldn't yet move my h-pawn without allowing him to fork my rooks from g3.

Bxa4 Bxa4 21. Nxa4 Bxd4 22. Qxd4 Qxc2#

784,25,22,Rab8,b'1rr3k1/4ppbp/3p2p1/p1q3Pn/B2NP3/5P2/1PPQ3P/2KR3R w - -',! Now b2 also comes under pressure and Black is about to fork the Ba4 and Nd4 with this rook.

808,26,11,1Ke3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p2pp/5p2/3Pp3/1bP5/3PKQ2/q2B1PPP/5B1R b kq -',My opponent makes another mistake needlessly surrendering his bishop to my attack.

Kxe5 Re8+ 20. Kd4 Qc3# or the extended mate after 19. Qxf5 Rxf5! I threaten checkmate with 20 ... Qf4#. He has 3 defenses. (3) 21. g3 Rf4+ 22. gxf4 Qxf4#  (4) 21. d4 Rf4+ 22.

813,27,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',In this game after a level opening I drop a pawn to a pretty combination. I fight on and manage to reach a level ending. I reach a position where they is just one move to draw. Unfortunately I don't find it and I lose!
814,27,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So this was playing in round 6 of the 4NCL (National Chess League) Division 3 North.
815,27,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',and it start conventionally enough.
816,27,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Likely to lead to the Queen's Indian Defence after Nf3 or the Nimzo Indian after Nc3.
817,27,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I opt for a Nimzo.
818,27,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Which he plays although he could have transposed into a Queen's Gambit with d5 or a Benoni with c5.
819,27,6,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I play the main line.
820,27,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',As does he.
821,27,8,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',So I develop.
822,27,9,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ d6',I'm very happy after this move as now if ever he doubles my c pawns with Bxc3 I can always undouble them.
823,27,10,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',So I develop.
824,27,11,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',He continues.
825,27,12,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I now think 0-0 is more accurate and will play 0-0 if I have this position again.
826,27,13,Bxc3+,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1bBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',So he takes.
827,27,14,bxc3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I take back.
828,27,15,Qc7,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',With a threat of taking on d4 and then on c4 and I can't recapture with the bishop.
829,27,16,cxd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',To meet that threat I make an exchange which I don't really want to make. I found out later that Qc2 is the usual move in this position.
830,27,17,exd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',He takes back.
831,27,18,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I finally castle.
832,27,19,1c4,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And he closes down the position for his two knights. In doing so he takes us out of the Gameknot opening databases (not that we were using them at the time of course!
833,27,20,1Be2,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/P1P1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So I come back.

837,27,24,1e4,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/2pPP3/P1P5/3NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now if he plays Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Rxe4 15.	Bf3 regains the pawn. But I couldn't have played this if he had played Bf5! last move.
838,27,25,1dxe4,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2n2n2/8/2pPp3/P1P5/3NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',So he takes this way instead.
839,27,26,1Nxc4,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2n2n2/8/2NPp3/P1P5/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',And I take back.
840,27,27,1Nd5,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2n5/3n4/2NPp3/P1P5/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',He hits c2
841,27,28,1Qc2,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2n5/3n4/2NPp3/P1P5/2Q1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I defend.
842,27,29,1Bd7,b'r3r1k1/ppqb1ppp/2n5/3n4/2NPp3/P1P5/2Q1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',He develops.

844,27,31,1Nf4,b'r3r1k1/ppqb1ppp/2n5/8/3Ppn2/P1P1N3/2Q1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',He hits my bishop.
845,27,32,1Bb2,b'r3r1k1/ppqb1ppp/2n5/8/3Ppn2/P1P1N3/1BQ1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I develop. This move is a mistake. What should I have played instead and why?
846,27,33,1Nxd4,b'r3r1k1/ppqb1ppp/8/8/3npn2/P1P1N3/1BQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Did you find this?

850,27,37,1Nxe2+,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/8/8/3Pp3/P7/1BN1nPPP/R4RK1 w - -',He takes.
851,27,38,2Kh1,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/8/8/3Pp3/P7/1BN1nPPP/R4R1K b - -',Forced!
852,27,39,2Nf4,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/8/8/3Ppn2/P7/1BN2PPP/R4R1K w - -',Aiming for d3
853,27,40,2Rab1,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/8/8/3Ppn2/P7/1BN2PPP/1R3R1K b - -',Played partly with the idea of retreating the bishop to a1.
854,27,41,2Bb5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/8/1b6/3Ppn2/P7/1BN2PPP/1R3R1K w - -',He hits my rook.
855,27,42,2Rfd1,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/8/1b6/3Ppn2/P7/1BN2PPP/1R1R3K b - -',So that the rook is not attacked when the knight comes in to d3.
856,27,43,2Ba4,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/8/8/b2Ppn2/P7/1BN2PPP/1R1R3K w - -',Perhaps he should have played this last move?
857,27,44,2Rd2,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/8/8/b2Ppn2/P7/1BNR1PPP/1R5K b - -',I defend the knight.
858,27,45,2Bxc2,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/8/8/3Ppn2/P7/1BbR1PPP/1R5K w - -',He takes.

874,27,61,3Rd7,b'8/pp1r1kpp/8/5p2/3Pp3/P5P1/5P1P/2R2K2 w - -',What is this? Is he really wanting to exchange my weak isolated d pawn for his b pawn?
875,27,62,3Ke2,b'8/pp1r1kpp/8/5p2/3Pp3/P5P1/4KP1P/2R5 b - -',Let's see.
876,27,63,3Rxd4,b'8/pp3kpp/8/5p2/3rp3/P5P1/4KP1P/2R5 w - -',Yes!

903,27,90,4Rxa7,b'8/R7/8/5p2/6k1/Pr6/5K2/8 b - -',We now reach an ending with a total of 6 pieces so after the game I was able to analyse this using a free  on-line chess ending database. As I suspected it is drawn but it is hard to draw!
904,27,91,Ra2,b'8/6R1/8/8/P4k2/3K1p2/r7/8 w - -',Ok. This is the position where there is only one move for white to draw. Without cheating and looking at your own database find it!
905,27,92,5Ra7,b'8/R7/8/8/P4k2/3K1p2/r7/8 b - -',Did you find it? The move I should have played is Rf7+ which draws. (suggest you do set it up on a database and check!) I am now lost.

1021,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',(This game was Round 16 of the Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade Candidates Chess Tournament this particular game played I believe in Zagreb Yugoslavia.) Fischer opens with e4 a widely known trademark of his. He was about 16 years old around the time of this tournament. You'll find people saying that d4 has more success in grandmaster play but Fischer was apparently not one of those grandmasters who'd ever claim or play such a thing. e4 was his preference in the opening.
1022,30,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"And ""Iron Tiger"" Petrosian opens with the Caro-Kann. I'm less sure of his frequency to play passive openings like the Caro-Kann but from what I hear his attention and accuracy in regard to defense was one of the most unique qualities to him in particular. So it goes he was one of the most difficult grandmasters ever to actually defeat..."
1023,30,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',More popular is 2. d4 nowadays. Nc3 seems okay but a tad passive in comparison IMO.
1024,30,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',Common for Black and the best reply I think as well.
1025,30,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',And Fischer tries to possess the center using his two knights. The approach is fine but in the Flohr varation (2. d4 d5 Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4) White looks fine and comfortable with maneuverability and I've found this in my own experiences with the opening as well. Instead when playing Two Knights here White has to concern himself with...
1026,30,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And frankly early knight pins are annoying! Perhaps this is why we see 2. d4 played more often.
1027,30,6,h3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Fischer doesn't seem so easily annoyed by opening pins however and invites Black's reply.
1028,30,7,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2b1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',More common is this. If the bishop is already here you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back.

It tends to be a nasty hole in the pawn structure and it just isn't worth the hassle when another back rank piece is within reach to capture instead... mostly. White usually castles short here as well...
1030,30,9,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Black can now take advantage of the lonely e4 pawn. White's going to need to be a bit more passive in development now making sure to cover all bases before launching a strike.
1031,30,10,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2NP1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Fischer plays this double-edged move. Once again I'm going to go on a bit more of an opening rant- it's a fair move guarding e4 again and letting the dark bishop come into the game to target g5 eventually but it also traps the light bishop. Meaning if White is planning to castle kingside it's all too obvious what the best plan that way will be- g3 has to be played followed by Bg2 and then O-O. Otherwise the light bishop takes on e2 but that won't be very effective if e4 is being pressured like this. So I feel as though Fischer is making his motives a little too obvious here for Petrosian. All in all I just don't think two-knights is an ideal opening for White to play himself into.
1032,30,11,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Still Petrosian seems to form his own agenda. With his own light bishop already gone he brings the other into the game. He's already used the most ideal piece to harass White's f3 with which is a tad unfortunate. Black looks solid so far...
1033,30,12,g3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1QPP/PPP2P2/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',And as I thought now Fischer begins his K-side fianchetto plans eyeing to castle short.
1034,30,13,Bb4,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1b2P3/2NP1QPP/PPP2P2/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Petrosian puts a halt to that plan by setting up yet another harassing bishop pin. He seems to really enjoy bishop -> knight trades but his plan appears sound.
1035,30,14,Bd2,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1b2P3/2NP1QPP/PPPB1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Playing anything else would force bxc3 after Bxc3+ again threatening to disrupt White's pawns.
1036,30,15,d4,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1pP3/2NP1QPP/PPPB1P2/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Petrosian is relentless about that knight. It's almost as though we've got a hit called on a simple horse. Well they are in the right time period for that I guess? At any rate I'm not sure I see better moves but I don't know if I can commit to the effect that perhaps Black is overreaching here. Yet if I were going to play anything else it'd have been O-O and I suppose that'd have been a tad passive.
1037,30,16,Nb1,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1pP3/3P1QPP/PPPB1P2/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',This is forced. If the knight doesn't move then dx. The only other decent looking square is then Ne2 but if White plays that then...
1038,30,17,Bxd2+,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPb1P2/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',"...White's king would be forced to capture. Now as for Black the saying goes again: ""If the bishop is already here you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back."" Perhaps a little less true here than with the other bishop. Could Bd6 have helped any?"
1039,30,18,1Nxd2,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq -',The knight now comes to rescue White's castling rights but Black is holding the initiative. White is slightly ahead in development but Black can grab space more easily on the board. White has slightly more use of his back pieces but...
1040,30,19,1e5,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1P2/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Black's pawns have more potential to inhibit White's ability to grab more control of the white squares after the fianchetto. With e4 stuck in place the White Queen is virtually forced to move away eventually in order to free Fischer's ability to stake a claim to the kingside. The game is still early but I'm pegging Black to have a slight edge over White here. I think there's a few more choices over the opposition and for every bonus White has Black has one too but the drawbacks seem slightly harsher against White. 
1041,30,20,1Bg2,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1PB1/R3K2R b KQkq -',The bishop fianchetto's itself anyway. It's a bit tragic for White I would think. If it weren't for the pawn on d4 (pretty much safe to break ONLY via White's c3) I would have strongly considered O-O-O. This just takes longer to set up and with e4 frozen in place I get a sense that White now needs to waste some valuable time fixing his defenses instead of developing further. If long castling looked better for White perhaps he could have been able to save himself said time needed to adjust himself. And yet again I hold the two knights variation responsible for Fischer's troubles here... This all being said I did decide to annotate this game for a reason... ;)
1042,30,21,1c5,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1PB1/R3K2R w KQkq -',If White was ever going to be able to stop Black from seizing the Queenside that hope is almost impossible now. This is now the foundation of the interesting dynamic of the game situation. White's only real contest starts with his cramped kingside. Black is free to win the queenside by storm. Both sides just kinda start ignoring the other's threats from here for the most part and it causes some pretty cool results...
1043,30,22,1O-O,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1PB1/R4RK1 b kq -',Anyway as I've already said White's kingside castling was forced upon him. This was the case since 6. d3 otherwise other moves could have made O-O-O possible.
1044,30,23,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1PB1/R4RK1 w kq -',Black is now hurrying to gain more ground on the Queenside hoping to pierce through into the back rank through that way. For good reason- White really doesn't have a lot of choices to stop any firm push that way and has no time to build defenses over there.
1045,30,24,1Qe2,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2PP/PPPNQPB1/R4RK1 b kq -',The White Queen takes its forced move in order to free the f-pawn to disrupt Black's e5 pawn. The only real good square for the queen as Qd1 would just confine the a-rook to the queenside.
1046,30,25,1Qe7,b'r3k2r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2PP/PPPNQPB1/R4RK1 w kq -',Conversely the Black Queen is moved here enabling O-O-O and helping to defend e5 further.
1047,30,26,1f4,b'r3k2r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pPP2/3P2PP/PPPNQ1B1/R4RK1 b kq f3',Finally! Fischer can start gathering some space again. But Black still has a lot of choices in what happens next so there's still a lot of work White needs to do to pull himself back into the game...
1048,30,27,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pPP2/3P2PP/PPPNQ1B1/R4RK1 w - -',Black finally castles. Eh maybe this could have happened a bit later? The Black King looked rather secure to me. A move like Nd7 would help strengthen e5 c5 and overall kingside defenses. I don't think f5 as a response from White would be all that helpful either- Black has no more bishops to block and the key diagonal to the Black King would be sealed by such a move.
1049,30,28,1a3,b'2kr3r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pPP2/P2P2PP/1PPNQ1B1/R4RK1 b - -',Whereas Black castling now seems to help White pick up a tempo. I'm not sure if Fischer thought that Nb4 was too worrying but even White's next move could have been hindered if other things had happened...
1050,30,29,1Ne8,b'2krn2r/pp2qppp/2n5/2p1p3/3pPP2/P2P2PP/1PPNQ1B1/R4RK1 w - -',But Petrosian doesn't seem too concerned. What's more- I suppose that if he delayed castling the knight wouldn't end up here and fall onto its next square. I'm really wondering if he instead just simply kept the knight on d7. Given what Fischer ends up doing it's unclear to me how that would have played out for Black...
1051,30,30,1b4,b'2krn2r/pp2qppp/2n5/2p1p3/1P1pPP2/P2P2PP/2PNQ1B1/R4RK1 b - b3',This is where the position starts looking a little unclear and it doesn't exactly clear up from here on out. Nc6 and the Black Queen are both guarding b4 and e5 but White is attacking both pieces at once- and say if ...cxb4 axb4 Black cannot play Nxb4 or else White plays Rxa7! But White now threatens b5- at the expense of his own tempo to break Black's defenses... on the kingside. Despite the semi-open nature of the board it's gotten itself fairly tangled up in the last four moves!
1052,30,31,1cxb4,b'2krn2r/pp2qppp/2n5/4p3/1p1pPP2/P2P2PP/2PNQ1B1/R4RK1 w - -',I don't think it's sensible to let White capture on c5 but the only things standing between the King and a White rook being a knight and an enemy pawn is a bit concerning to me if I were Black.
1053,30,32,1Nc4,b'2krn2r/pp2qppp/2n5/4p3/1pNpPP2/P2P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 b - -',And it looks like said knight on c6 is going to be needed in a little bit so I'd be even more concerned by this point. Petrosian on the other hand seems to be quite comfortable with where his King is for the time being and even seems to flaunt that later...
1054,30,33,1f6,b'2krn2r/pp2q1pp/2n2p2/4p3/1pNpPP2/P2P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',But White winning undisputed control over e5 is a concern that needs to be addressed so out comes this pawn to stop White from pushing further into the Black camp. (I'm still wondering about if Black had the other knight on d7!)
1055,30,34,1fxe5,b'2krn2r/pp2q1pp/2n2p2/4P3/1pNpP3/P2P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 b - -',White pierces the e5 pawn starting to crack into the wall stopping e4 from pushing further...!
1056,30,35,1fxe5,b'2krn2r/pp2q1pp/2n5/4p3/1pNpP3/P2P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',But Black is still ready to defend himself. White would like to play Rf5 I'm sure but g6 from Black might cause a bit of trouble. Around here I imagine Fischer woke up again and realized that he's down material again...
1057,30,36,1axb4,b'2krn2r/pp2q1pp/2n5/4p3/1PNpP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 b - -',So he neutralizes once again probably wondering how he can proceed with any sensible attack. It still looks like Black has plenty of options to respond here.
1058,30,37,1Nc7,b'2kr3r/ppn1q1pp/2n5/4p3/1PNpP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',This knight is really starting to raise a lot of questions from me. I just have to wonder. Why couldn't Black play Nxb4 or Qxb4? And if that reason involves e5 losing too many defenses then would Nd7 not have helped Black's capture on b4? I think Petrosian's setup here is cool but I clearly don't view my defenses the way he does. I guess I'm a bit too tactical in my thinking for my own good. I personally don't see any good having to wait for White to play b5 once that move actually starts to look promising.
1059,30,38,2Na5,b'2kr3r/ppn1q1pp/2n5/N3p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 b - -',Fischer starts to threaten some disruption in Black's structure for a change of pace as opposed to Black's tricks way back with all the Bishop pinning.
1060,30,39,2Nb5,b'2kr3r/pp2q1pp/2n5/Nn2p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',And this was a nice call by Petrosian because I don't think White has a threat that way anymore. If White captures it just accelerates Black's ability to keep a hold on b5 which should harm White's ability to counterplay here and to focus more on the squeezed kingside instead.
1061,30,40,2Nxc6,b'2kr3r/pp2q1pp/2N5/1n2p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 b - -',White doesn't seem to mind that thought though instead hoping to simplify a bit more on the board. Fischer always did like his rooks but that bishop is virtually dead on g2. I don't know about the exchange of his final active minor back piece when Black still has the other knight with plenty of room to control the board. This entire setup is not done looking complex but still...
1062,30,41,2bxc6,b'2kr3r/p3q1pp/2p5/1n2p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',...I just have to think that e4 is terribly crippling White here. Black looks solid easily maneuverable and even though e5 is looking a bit stranded White's going to have to make some tough calls and sacrifices in order to stay in the game. I get that Bobby was only 16 and only improved his games from here but ouch. I can't say this looks hopeful for him. And yet...
1063,30,42,2Rf2,b'2kr3r/p3q1pp/2p5/1n2p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1QRB1/R5K1 b - -',Planning to stack the rooks hoping to attack Black's seemingly only weakness- the 7th rank.
1064,30,43,2g6,b'2kr3r/p3q2p/2p3p1/1n2p3/1P1pP3/3P2PP/2P1QRB1/R5K1 w - -',I'm assuming Petrosian sensed a need to defend e5 via stopping both Rf5 and Qh5 from White but I dare say this kinda misses the point? I would think that if White was planning either move g6 would be a stopping move after the fact. Playing it now seems a bit premature to me.
1065,30,44,2h4,b'2kr3r/p3q2p/2p3p1/1n2p3/1P1pP2P/3P2P1/2P1QRB1/R5K1 b - -',I mean I'm not sure what Black could have done instead... (I want to say Qxb4 but I see Rf7 causing Black some grief) but I think playing g6 right then is just disrupted further by this. I'm not too sure about my analysis here. As I've said before the board looks awfully unclear and I don't think I'd have handled this the way the two grandmasters played it out.
1066,30,45,2Kb7,b'3r3r/pk2q2p/2p3p1/1n2p3/1P1pP2P/3P2P1/2P1QRB1/R5K1 w - -',Anyway interesting enough Black comes up with this and I'm actually very fond of this move. I love games where the King suddenly assumes the role of a key defender in weaknesses and Petrosian is quite well known for this playstyle. From here I feel Black starts making a lot of good choices capitalizing on the great placements of his King from here following.
1067,30,46,2h5,b'3r3r/pk2q2p/2p3p1/1n2p2P/1P1pP3/3P2P1/2P1QRB1/R5K1 b - -',Next comes this but White shouldn't be extremely keen on taking on g6 right away- if hxg6 hxg6 Black would have a rook screaming down the h-file where White's King looks potentially exploitable after potentially dealing with the g6 pawn. Black doesn't end up focusing on that though...
1068,30,47,2Qxb4,b'3r3r/pk5p/2p3p1/1n2p2P/1q1pP3/3P2P1/2P1QRB1/R5K1 w - -',Again here especially is where it seems to be White and Black having two overall plans to control opposite sides of the board and not do much to hinder one or the other. Black gains a bit of a material edge here but it's rather short-lived and hard to say if too much came from this capture in the end.
1069,30,48,2Rf7+,b'3r3r/pk3R1p/2p3p1/1n2p2P/1q1pP3/3P2P1/2P1Q1B1/R5K1 b - -',White can finally start grabbing hold of the open 7th rank now forcing the King to reconsider safe squares to be on and targetting a7/h7.
1070,30,49,2Kb6,b'3r3r/p4R1p/1kp3p1/1n2p2P/1q1pP3/3P2P1/2P1Q1B1/R5K1 w - -',Petrosian simply decides on this square. The Black King is now guarding even more pieces and it's not confined to the back rank either. It's not even done walking yet- this is just the beginning of the King's morning stroll! However at the very least for White c4 is starting to look a little more promising...
1071,30,50,2Qf2,b'3r3r/p4R1p/1kp3p1/1n2p2P/1q1pP3/3P2P1/2P2QB1/R5K1 b - -',Fischer continues planning an all out assault on Black's back ranks. However...
1072,30,51,2a5,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp3p1/pn2p2P/1q1pP3/3P2P1/2P2QB1/R5K1 w - a6',...now Black can begin threatening his own threats against White's back rank should Fischer find no decent way to stop this passed pawn from Queening.
1073,30,52,2c4,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp3p1/pn2p2P/1qPpP3/3P2P1/5QB1/R5K1 b - c3',White hits the knight. Black would love to capture en passant- unfortunately the pin is stopping that from being possible. The knight must move.
1074,30,53,2Nc3,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp3p1/p3p2P/1qPpP3/2nP2P1/5QB1/R5K1 w - -',Even if White's queen was on f1 this proves that Rb1 was never going to be possible to pin the Black Queen. This knight is just menacing White's defenses now and Black still has a lot of control of his space. I'm fascinated by this really- despite e5 and the kingside pawns being a clear weakness Black's degree of controlling the board due to the use of the queenside advantage is just so cool to see unfold into a balanced game here...
1075,30,54,2Rf1,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp3p1/p3p2P/1qPpP3/2nP2P1/5QB1/5RK1 b - -',White's rook was never getting anything done on a1 anyway. It's no good to keep the rook on the a file anyway because that pawn is protected on every single square except for the final promoting one. White must move carefully and watch the time he spends pushing because it's impossible to stop Black's promotion threat now.
1076,30,55,2a4,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp3p1/4p2P/pqPpP3/2nP2P1/5QB1/5RK1 w - -',Moves before a1=Q: 3.
1077,30,56,2Qf6,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp2Qp1/4p2P/pqPpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 b - -',Moves before h5 promotes: 4+. So White's solution is to threaten a rook fork- if 30. Rxh7 Rxh7 then White plays Qxd8...!
1078,30,57,2Qc5,b'3r3r/5R1p/1kp2Qp1/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 w - -',Now as for this... I'm not sure what the Queen's doing here that she wasn't doing on b4. Why did Petrosian need this? Wouldn't a3 be better? Or was White's c5+ actually threatening?
1079,30,58,3Rxh7,b'3r3r/7R/1kp2Qp1/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 b - -',Anyway White finally balances the material again but it's still going to come at a crucial tempo cost...
1080,30,59,3Rdf8,b'5r1r/7R/1kp2Qp1/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 w - -',Now that the rook is off f7 White can no longer brute-force the rooks on the back rank without losing the Queen in the process.
1081,30,60,3Qxg6,b'5r1r/7R/1kp3Q1/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 b - -',So White simply allows for the pawn to advance further.
1082,30,61,3Rxh7,b'5r2/7r/1kp3Q1/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 w - -',But before that Petrosian is going to force the White Queen to get in the way of the pawn again and that's going to put Fischer enough of moves behind promotion now to at least warrant annoyance.
1083,30,62,3Qxh7,b'5r2/7Q/1kp5/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5RK1 b - -',Likewise. Moves before h8=Q: 4.
1084,30,63,3Rxf1+,b'8/7Q/1kp5/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/6B1/5rK1 w - -',Black finishes trading the rook pairs and to put White over a move behind in tempo is easily worth the trade I think. I'm not sure if Black could have handled that any better honestly...
1085,30,64,3Bxf1,b'8/7Q/1kp5/2q1p2P/p1PpP3/2nP2P1/8/5BK1 b - -',Why not Kxf1? Could Black really harass anything with Qf8+?
1086,30,65,3a3,b'8/7Q/1kp5/2q1p2P/2PpP3/p1nP2P1/8/5BK1 w - -',Moves before a1=Q: 2.
1087,30,66,3h6,b'8/7Q/1kp4P/2q1p3/2PpP3/p1nP2P1/8/5BK1 b - -',Moves before h8=Q: 3.
1088,30,67,3a2,b'8/7Q/1kp4P/2q1p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/p7/5BK1 w - -',Moves before a1=Q: 1!!!
1089,30,68,3Qg8,b'6Q1/8/1kp4P/2q1p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/p7/5BK1 b - -',Moves before h8=Q: 2.
1090,30,69,3a1=Q,b'6Q1/8/1kp4P/2q1p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/8/q4BK1 w - -',Promotion! Although I suppose looking at this again had White played Kxf1 after the rook check this Queen suddenly appearing on a1 would be a lot of cause for concern but even so... White's bishop is stuck dead AGAIN this time pinned by a second queen...!
1091,30,70,3h7,b'6Q1/7P/1kp5/2q1p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/8/q4BK1 b - -',White's only hope is to start making threats with a second queen on the board but is still plenty of tempo behind Black right now.
1092,30,71,3Qd6,b'6Q1/7P/1kpq4/4p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/8/q4BK1 w - -',I imagine Petrosian stopping to have a think here. He has a second queen now? Great! Now that he has it what to do? Surprisingly enough if Ne2+ the bishop may not be able to capture but seems to provide White's King all the necessary defenses against even two queens for Black's desperate queen-prevention plan to eventually run out of steam. So instead I suppose the original Black Queen goes here in other to stop the original White Queen from perpetualing the Black King into either a draw or losing the a1=Q. So close and yet so unfortunate Petrosian!!!
1093,30,72,3h8=Q,b'6QQ/8/1kpq4/4p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/8/q4BK1 b - -',"And so it begins a game that is ""highly unrealistic to have four queens on the board"" as White and Black now try to figure out how to maneuver themselves into a winning position. Hey! You two grandmasters over there! Stop trying to compose puzzles and go back to playing a ""realistic"" tournament game! Don't make us throw the rulebook at you against having four queens on the board! (I jest but even still I find the whole argument to be a tad bit... close-minded at times. :P)"
1094,30,73,3Qa7,b'6QQ/q7/1kpq4/4p3/2PpP3/2nP2P1/8/5BK1 w - -',Anyway the second queen realizes her attack is incomplete and retreats to defend Black's back rank here. Even in spite of so many pieces falling off the board at this point it's really hard to say just how clear the position is isn't it?
1095,30,74,3g4,b'6QQ/q7/1kpq4/4p3/2PpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 b - -',I'm a bit surprised Fischer did this- maybe a reminder to Petrosian that White still has a passed pawn? Still I kinda find this move weak... did his queens really have nowhere worth going?
1096,30,75,3Kc5,b'6QQ/q7/2pq4/2k1p3/2PpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 w - -',"""Alright ladies I'm going on another stroll to refresh my thoughts!"" And the Black King walks off leaving the mess of his home behind. Vintage Petrosian everyone! *bows* In all seriousness I feel like if Black's King could somehow break a key defense at the core of the board White would be in a lot of trouble. Maybe he really has the right idea (possibility even inviting a trade via Qd5+?) but the board looks very twisted right now and it's difficult to say what's going to happen next. Surely if either side blunders it's going to be fatal."
1097,30,76,3Qgf8,b'5Q1Q/q7/2pq4/2k1p3/2PpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 b - -',I guess Fischer would like to trade a queen pair but realizes that Black has far more of a grip on d5 than he does on d6. Black can't play Qxf8 either or else White's Qxf8 is check. Hmm...
1098,30,77,3Qae7,b'5Q1Q/4q3/2pq4/2k1p3/2PpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 w - -',I would consider this sound really. Now White's Queen (the original one) has to run off somewhere again because Black can now hold the position after trading. Where could Fischer put it...?
1099,30,78,4Qfa8,b'Q6Q/4q3/2pq4/2k1p3/2PpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 b - -',Good eye by Fischer- a3 looks particularly weak! Even so there's just one tiny yet amazing hiccup to White's plan here...
1100,30,79,4Kb4,b'Q6Q/4q3/2pq4/4p3/1kPpP1P1/2nP4/8/5BK1 w - -',Namely Black's King seems awfully at ease with pondering life's questions while all these queens wonder what to do about him. Now Black defends a3 with just his King and it works so beautifully. The dynamic of this complex position is just captivating. Personally I've long given up on trying to predict the two grandmasters at this point because Queen combinations really exhaust the imagination of trying to find White's and Black's best moves. I'm just stuck trying to interpret what they're thinking at this point. 
1101,30,80,4Qh2,b'Q7/4q3/2pq4/4p3/1kPpP1P1/2nP4/7Q/5BK1 b - -',I'm sure Fischer spent a lot of time considering the position as well. Let's consider- say if White had instead moved Qhb8. Then Black plays Qxb8 meeting White's Qxb8+. Does White have a perpetual? If he did should he pursue it? Earlier I'd state that I think Black had a clear edge over White but now? The board looks far too unclear now to state one over at the other at this point. I wonder what engine analysis would have to say about this game...?
1102,30,81,4Kb3,b'Q7/4q3/2pq4/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP4/7Q/5BK1 w - -',Black's King continues his stroll... guarding all three weakpoints (a3 a2 b2) at once from TWO QUEENS! The knight can now help solve Qa4 and Q(a/h)a2 and the two Black Queens are helping fight off Qa3 and Qb8. I just can't help but be so entertained by Black's magic behind his King Gladiator play here. How could a person ever defend a King from two freaking queens so well by mainly just using his king?!
1103,30,82,4Qa1,b'8/4q3/2pq4/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP4/7Q/Q4BK1 b - -',I'm sure Fischer tried as hard as he could to find an opening in that incredible defense but this marks the final straw. If he can't join the queens on b2 then Black despite being so open and flamboyant in the central fray is completely solid even despite the screaming rage from two of the strongest piece in Chess. Worse if White relented now it'd just give Black the opportunity to use his Queens again.
1104,30,83,4Qda3,b'8/4q3/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/qknP4/7Q/Q4BK1 w - -',But Petrosian knows his defenses are virtually complete if b2 is guarded which he does here. White is forced to give up a queen pair or give up tempo. Truly brilliant play from Petrosian. Although I hear he was quite exhausted by now with all the combinations at this point- I can't say I blame him!
1105,30,84,4Qxa3+,b'8/4q3/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/QknP4/7Q/5BK1 b - -',Fischer opts to simplify at long last rather than lose even more tempo this match.
1106,30,85,4Kxa3,b'8/4q3/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/k1nP4/7Q/5BK1 w - -',Hmm and Petrosian continues to allow his King to ponder life's questions instead of capturing with Queen. Although I do suppose that capturing with Queen could be a bit more dangerous- Fischer's king is safe where it is right now and a Queen on a3 really wouldn't be doing much as is.
1107,30,86,4Qh6,b'8/4q3/2p4Q/4p3/2PpP1P1/k1nP4/8/5BK1 b - -',But if this Queen couldn't go to its next square perhaps Black would be more compromised without as many alternatives so I'm going to keep applauding Petrosian's masterful King maneuvers.
1108,30,87,4Qf7,b'8/5q2/2p4Q/4p3/2PpP1P1/k1nP4/8/5BK1 w - -',f3 is looking pretty weak for White right now! If Qxc6 now by White Qf3 freezes everything on White's kingside and probably could mean mate...!!!
1109,30,88,4Kg2,b'8/5q2/2p4Q/4p3/2PpP1P1/k1nP4/6K1/5B2 b - -',RJF isn't letting that slip by! But there's still a lot that needs to be done...
1110,30,89,4Kb3,b'8/5q2/2p4Q/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP4/6K1/5B2 w - -',Hmm more king strolling? I guess Qd6 threatens more to Black than Qxc6 then. 
1111,30,90,4Qd2,b'8/5q2/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP4/3Q2K1/5B2 b - -',And here I can only imagine White being concerned about that knight making it to d1 threatening Qf2 at least losing the bishop and probably the King shortly after. But this pretty much confines the White Queen to more of a defensive role for the rest of the match- there's no way to check the Black King effectively from the White back ranks...
1112,30,91,4Qh7,b'8/7q/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP4/3Q2K1/5B2 w - -',Petrosian exploits this having a certain threat in mind. Can you spot it before continuing?
1113,30,92,4Kg3,b'8/7q/2p5/4p3/2PpP1P1/1knP2K1/3Q4/5B2 b - -',White plays this. Now why? What did Fischer see? 
1114,30,93,4Qxe4,b'8/8/2p5/4p3/2Ppq1P1/1knP2K1/3Q4/5B2 w - -',He saw that Black had this. White can't play Qxc3+ because then Black promotes a third queen after dxc3 (the light bishop is too confined to stop promotion). Meanwhile if White just plays dxe4 then that obviously loses after Nxe4+!!! Black has now balanced the material again with White's defenses clearly showing its awkwardness once and for all. Now had White's King remained on g2 this would be check. But I have to wonder- what happens if White had played 47. Qe1 instead?
1115,30,94,4Qf2,b'8/8/2p5/4p3/2Ppq1P1/1knP2K1/5Q2/5B2 b - -',The White Queen moves out of the range of the knight before more trouble ensues.
1116,30,95,4Qh1,b'8/8/2p5/4p3/2Pp2P1/1knP2K1/5Q2/5B1q w - -',And finally the Black Queen goes here controlling the h-file and allowing for e4 (but d4 must be defended first or else Qxd4). Oddly enough Fischer offers a draw here and Petrosian accepts it. I'm going to fall back to say that I believe Black has a slight edge here just because his control of the Queenside remained dominant throughout the match and is now relevant to the position at hand. But I suppose Petrosian was exhausted after that wonderful display of defense. I can't say for sure but I thought this game was amazing- it was nice to see Fischer recover and display his sharp wit even in a disadvantaged position but Petrosian's king walk was just too fun to watch unfold. Fun fact- both survived queens are the newly promoted ones! That all aside I hope you enjoyed this match as much as I did! Thanks for reading this annotation! :)

It's also basically asymmetrical in nature leading to dynamic fluid positions with little chance of ending ending in a draw.
1146,32,1,Bxb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',The most common continuation usually leading to sharp positions where White may have to play carefully. Longer-term he may find a positional bonus in the exchange as he now has a surplus of center pawns but his kingside is often a bit soft for a long while.
1147,32,2,c4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1bP5/8/P2PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq c3',We're still deep in opening theory here and White has several good options. 4.Nf3 is also good.
1148,32,3,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1bP5/4PN2/P2P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',White is in no hurry to exhange in the center; if Black captures on c4 White will recapture and develop his bishop in one move. Also White is now in a real hurry to get his king safely tucked away before Black can start operations for real.
1149,32,4,a3,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1bP5/P3PN2/3P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',A small but very important move. White's bishop on e5 is on the verge of being forced off e5 and when that happens Black would like nothing better than to post his bishop on d6. With his dsb on d6 Black will be in position to exert potentially fatal levels of pressure against White's underdeveloped kingside. But by forcing the bishop to move now White prevents this. Black will either have to move his bishop off-line to a5 or waste a tempo in tucking it away on f8; if it moves to d6 immediately White will simply exchange it.
1150,32,5,Be2,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/b2pB3/2P5/P3PN2/3PBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',White cannot put off moving his bishop any longer. White considered capturing on d5 first but rejected that line because the black knight on d5 (after recapture) would make development of his knight on b1 more difficult.
1151,32,6,1Bb2,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/b7/2B5/P3PN2/1B1P1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',Retreating to b2 is preferable here as the bishop preserves his influence on the long diagonal. On 10.Bg3 Black may consider exchanging his knight on f6 for it (after Nf6-h5xg3) which would immobilize White's kingside and weaken his center pawns.
1152,32,7,Ne5,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/b3n3/2B3b1/P3PN2/1B1P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',The automatic move in this position would be Be2 moving the lsb out of danger and protecting the knight on f3. But... this would cost White the bishop pair and exchange a rather powerful freeranging piece for a bishop of mediocre influence. Are there any alternatives? Turns out there is one...

Turns out there are fascinating combinations against Black's king queen and rook based on the weakness of f7 and the relative placement of the pieces.
1154,32,9,1Nxf7,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2Npp/5n2/b7/2B5/P3P3/1B1P1PPP/RN1b1RK1 b - -',This may look a little insane but consider for a moment: where is the Black queen to go? There are only two squares where it won't be immediately lost once White moves his knight off f7 (with a discovered check): e7 and b8. Of these b8 may actually be the best choice but it's a real dreadful place for the queen to be.
1155,32,10,Kf8,b'r3rk2/ppp1q1pp/5n2/b5N1/2B5/P3P3/1B1P1PPP/RN1b1RK1 w - -',Or Black could try Kh8 with an implicit draw offer. White would reject that of course the whole point of this line being that White believes his pieces to be more powerful united than Black's more mobile but single queen.
1156,32,11,1Nxe8,b'r3N3/pp2q1pp/5nk1/b7/2B5/P3P3/1B1P1PPP/RN1b1RK1 b - -',And White is at plus 1 with two passed protected center pawns a well-protected king vs. Black's out-in-the-open majesty and the bishop pair.

For instance 19.h3 opens the door for Bxd2!? with dangerous complications. White is dangerously weak on e3 as shown by this line: 19.h3 Bxd2!? 20.hxg4 Bxe3 21.Bd4 Bxd4 22.Rxd4 Qe1+ 23.Kh2 Qxf2 24.Rd2 Qh4+ 25.Kg1 Re1+ 26.Bf1 Qf6 27.Rf2 Qxa1 -/+ White looks able to hold if he plays 20.Nxd2 instead but why give Black such counterplay at all in the first place?

Both f2 and h2 are weak and Black aims to follow up by moving his knight back to g4 threatening them both at the same time. But now White is sufficiently developed to take advantage of his piece superiority and Black's exposed king.
1159,32,14,Kh6,b'4r3/pp4pp/7k/b7/5Nnq/P3P3/1B1PBPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Winning a tempo which gives White the option of doing a lightning-transfer of the knight to h3 from where it will shield all of his weaknesses.

1161,32,16,2Nh5,b'5r2/pp4pp/7k/b3B2n/7q/P3PP1N/3PB1PP/R2R2K1 w - -',Potentially a grave mistake. White cannot take advantage of it now - his knight on h3 would hang - but maybe later... and if not then Black will for sure have to spend extra time moving the knight out of danger again.

Here Deep Blue opens with e4. Now before I go any further I'd again like to repeat that I am a mere inferior advanced player purely interested in Grandmaster annotations to better myself in the long run. I plan on doing these alongside my blitz and standard annotations but in these ones especially I am looking to compare my own thoughts of the position to what others make of the position. I am not stating that my opinions are correct- these are masters and they would crush me any day. :P
1178,33,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Kasparov plays e5. I can't remember who said this but apparently some spectators were surprised as he usually is a fan of the Sicilian but he had certain intentions for this day.
1179,33,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3. This is getting closer to the camp of what I'd play as a White player planning...
1180,33,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays Nc6. Fearless as always.
1181,33,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bb5 - we enter the Ruy Lopez. This is one of my favorite White openings heralded as one of the best openings to get to play with as the White pieces. It's well known for the early castling and has one of the best chances to develop early for attacking sooner.
1182,33,5,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black plays a6. Very common and forces the bishop to move. White still has several options.
1183,33,6,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',More popular is the variation where White doesn't capture Nc6. If the knight is taken Black suffers an early Queenside scatter but at the cost of the typically stronger bishop for White to have.
1184,33,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Also main line. This develops Black and is a fast reminder to White that he's left the e4 pawn hanging for the time being.
1185,33,8,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',But it doesn't usually stop White from castling anyway because there's a certain gambit if Nxe4 starting with Re1. That would mark the beginning of the Tarrasch Defense where the knight retreats to c5 (usually) and then White plays Bxc6 scattering the Black's queenside further and making Rxe5+ a possible move. It turns into a very violent and open game definitely not something I'd opt for as Black.
1186,33,9,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Normally Black instead plays this the Closed variation to the Ruy. For good reason- the general overall wide consensus of the Chess community back in 1997 was that when it comes down to Open games tactics (trading targetting pieces) tends to be where a computer is stronger as opposed to Closed games where strategy (no contact unless needed more about winning control of squares rather than pieces) tends to be where people would evaluate positions stronger than computers back then. Kasparov himself was famous for inventing this approach and he was very confident at the time that it was going to work to his advantage. Unfortunately it doesn't quite work that way for him.
1187,33,10,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White plays Re1 to guard the e4 pawn. Better than d3 (because White wants to play d4) and Nc3 the worst reply IMO because of Black's next move...
1188,33,11,b5,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq b6',If Nc3 was played now White would have too many pieces on this side of the board that this pawn could harass without issue.
1189,33,12,Bb3,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',So the bishop retreats here targetting f7. It's safe for now.
1190,33,13,d6,b'r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',This is known as the Leonhardt Variation on GameKnot. As Kasparov was hoping this was a good choice for a convoluted opening because I think he was playing the best overall moves as Black from here. It involves a lot of re-arranging of pieces transforming into a difficult knot in the center for White to untangle... d6 offers more strength to e5 after White clearly wants d4 and opens the light bishop into the game.
1191,33,14,c3,b'r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',And for White I also think Deep Blue was also choosing better moves. After d6 d4 now would be totally premature. c3 offers an additional defender to the d4 square and gives c2 as a hiding place to the bishop in case of a5 or Na5.
1192,33,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',Black castles now before delaying it starts getting in the way of his plans.
1193,33,16,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Black instead could have played Bg4 an aggressive move to pin the knight. It's not an option anymore but I'm sure that wasn't a concern to Kasparov.
1194,33,17,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',h6 - preventing Ng5 from White who plans to trade the bishop-knight pair for Black's f7-rook. It would leave Black's king exposed on f7 but no real good way to attack it immediately with only the White Queen after the light bishop sacrifice. Still this is a very passive response from Black trying not to give Deep Blue any clear fast entry into his domain.
1195,33,18,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - d3',And then White plays d4. Nothing much else to say it gives White more space to do things but Black is still very solid no matter how you slice this. I don't think d3 would be any better- it was time to move this pawn.
1196,33,19,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',Planning to defend e5 if White captures no longer needing to worry about f7 falling after Ng5. Black could maybe entertain Bb7 to pressure e4 or perhaps Rb8 planning b4 but I think this is better.
1197,33,20,1Nbd2,b'r1bqr1k1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Hmm... I can't remember if I've ever played this myself. White doesn't want this knight to stay here. He wants to move it to another square to continue guarding e4 eyeing Ng3. Be3 could be played at the expense of allowing Nxe4. White also had d5 but that simply is answered by Na5 chasing the bishop out. Or maybe even Na7 looks okay. I'm not sure of my analysis here.
1198,33,21,1Bf8,b'r1bqrbk1/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Meanwhile Black has this wonderful square for the dark bishop. It's a bonus guard to g7 to his back rank influences h6 and remains sights on c5-d6. Really the only drawback to playing this is it being harder to rush down White with f5 any time soon but that's more of an endgame concern at this point- Kasparov plans to take his time with the computer here.
1199,33,22,1Nf1,b'r1bqrbk1/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRNK1 b - -',The knight continues its journey to g3 and d4 is strengthened again.
1200,33,23,1Bd7,b'r2qrbk1/2pb1pp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRNK1 w - -',Hmm... I'm not sure about this move from Kasparov though. If it was time for the bishop to move then why not Bb7? Is it because he wants Be6 to remain playable for the long term part of this match? I'm not sure why he's comfortable with blocking the queen's influence on the d-file like this.
1201,33,24,1Ng3,b'r2qrbk1/2pb1pp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2NNP/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The knight now lands on g3. Black no longer has any hope of attacking e4 any time soon and White can return to further development to claiming more ground.
1202,33,25,1Na5,b'r2qrbk1/2pb1pp1/p2p1n1p/np2p3/3PP3/1BP2NNP/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Kasparov notices this and decides he needs to start pushing White back in order to gain ground of his own; this forces the bishop away and frees his c-pawn for him to work out where it needs to go.
1203,33,26,1Bc2,b'r2qrbk1/2pb1pp1/p2p1n1p/np2p3/3PP3/2P2NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',So now White has two back-rank pairings with the knights and bishops. This is ideal and another reason why I love the Ruy as White. The games can get complicated but for situations like this...?
1204,33,27,1c5,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p2p1n1p/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - c6',But for now Kasparov gains space of his own with this attempting to tempt White into capturing and distorting the control of the center.
1205,33,28,1b3,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p2p1n1p/npp1p3/3PP3/1PP2NNP/P1B2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Instead White plays this countering Black from playing ...c4. Still I wonder- if White had just played d5 now would allowing Black c4 cause too much of a disruption?
1206,33,29,1Nc6,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p1np1n1p/1pp1p3/3PP3/1PP2NNP/P1B2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Black wants the knight in a better home having a certain idea in mind if White pushes again...
1207,33,30,1d5,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p1np1n1p/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP2NNP/P1B2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',And White grabs hold of d5 probably the most logical looking move at this point...
1208,33,31,1Ne7,b'r2qrbk1/3bnpp1/p2p1n1p/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP2NNP/P1B2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',And finally the knight retreats here as planned. Let's take a moment to evaluate the position. I suppose this answers me why Kasparov elected for Bd7 instead of Bb7... somewhat. Nf5 is looking a little scary at this point and it's a bit harder for White to break in from that way for now. It also answers why Black played c5 instead of c6 as a counter to White's d5 because this knight wouldn't have been able to fall back to e7 as easily and now d5 is being fought back reasonably. But still... Grandmaster behind the black pieces aside I definitely think Deep Blue was winning this game at this point. White has a clear mobility advantage and both pairings of the back pieces prevent Black from reaching out just the same as Black's arrangement prevents White from coming in any further for now. Yes Kasparov has three quite scary looking queen pawns that could bother White a little and the Black Queen and Rooks can aid in such an attack but Kasparov cannot ignore White's mobility to continue defending or attacking. Given that White clearly has more options I say so too is the advantage a little clear in White's favour at this point in my honest opinion.
1209,33,32,1Be3,b'r2qrbk1/3bnpp1/p2p1n1p/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP1BNNP/P1B2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Be3 - I'm guessing White wanted to develop the bishop off of the back rank for the rooks. There's not really any good squares for this bishop to have right now so I'd imagine Deep Blue thought that it was going to get in the way somehow. I wonder why it didn't consider Bb2 though?
1210,33,33,1Ng6,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p2p1nnp/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP1BNNP/P1B2PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Though I guess that if Bb2 were going to be played it would be seriously undermined by this move. Black copies White's knight pair adding 2 more defenders to e5 making it more difficult for White to target it. Bb2 would be more to undermine an attempt to weaken the kingside defenses. Maybe this is why Be3 was better?
1211,33,34,1Qd2,b'r2qrbk1/3b1pp1/p2p1nnp/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP1BNNP/P1BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',And now White plays this. It definitely looks like there's a plan with the A-rook now because Bxh6 is out of the question entirely with a position looking like this. Either that or White's planning to go ahead with f4 eventually and have the Queen there ready to help aid such a pawn push.
1212,33,35,1Nh7,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p2np/1ppPp3/4P3/1PP1BNNP/P1BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',It looks like Kasparov thinks so too so I'm guessing he's trying to hide the knight away freeing his f-pawn and Queen to help aid in the kingside defenses. But surely he isn't planning ...f6 right? If f6 that knight is going to lose a lot more influence and the Queen's ability to help in the kingside will be cut. So while I like this move and I can't suggest any better ones... I also just have to wonder what he's thinking. Specifically why Black isn't advancing more ground in the queenside? What's Kasparov waiting for before he does something that way?
1213,33,36,1a4,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p2np/1ppPp3/P3P3/1PP1BNNP/2BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 b - a3',Okay. From this part on I'm openly going to predict that my annotations aren't going to be exactly accurate for the rest of the match and this move signals it- the board has gotten far too complex for a player of my level. This move is a very interesting one as it gives White even more space to control and it begins to contest Black's scary looking queenside but at the same time I would be concerned about if Black played bxa4 on his 19th. White would have bxa4 but then Black could then play Rb8. White's Queen is stuck on d2 and would have to waste a tempo in order to return back but Black would always have a grip on the b-file. I would think that such an exchange could help Kasparov wouldn't it?
1214,33,37,1Nh4,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/P3P2n/1PP1BNNP/2BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',But no. Kasparov instead instigates a knight exchange. But quite honestly I question if this is the best move Black has. That knight on g6 was a powerful one and Black has more influence on the queenside whereas White had more in the kingside. So the fact that this knight was helping undermine White I don't think it's as valuable as White's Nf3! Further it looks to me like White wants to play f4 so the Nf3 would have to move anyway so the knight exchange would actually help accelerate White to play f4! I'm not sure how long it took Kasparov to come up with this move... but I really wonder why he went for it instead of something like bxa4.
1215,33,38,2Nxh4,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/P3P2N/1PP1B1NP/2BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',It looks to me that Deep Blue agreed with my analysis and accepts the knight trade. Interestingly enough after twenty moves this capture marks the first one of the match!
1216,33,39,2Qxh4,b'r3rbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/P3P2q/1PP1B1NP/2BQ1PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',And now the Queen finishes the exchange. A bit soon I think for Black to play a bit wayward over here for my liking. The Queen is safe here for now but isn't attacking anything of value at the end of this exchange. Back on d8 there seemed to have more options helping advance Black on the queenside.
1217,33,40,2Qe2,b'r3rbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/P3P2q/1PP1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Deep Blue comes up with this. Now this I'm less sure why. I'm not certain if it was because e4 needed another defender if White plans on c4 or something else. Could White play a5 instead and Black responding with b4 be not that bad?
1218,33,41,2Qd8,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/P3P3/1PP1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R3R1K1 w - -',As though she found a sale price before anyone else at the marketplace Black's Queen rushes off back home as soon as she appeared. I'm more and more unsure if I appreciate 19 ...Nh4 at this point because all I see is it giving White more of a tempo after that exchange. I'm back to thinking that maybe bxa4 back then was better.
1219,33,42,2b4,b'r2qrbk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/PP2P3/2P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Deep Blue must have thought that the board wasn't complicated enough and out comes this. I like it but again I think it gets awfully twisted once you start asking what happens if Black accepts bxa4? Is Black's light bishop too powerful to trade off on a4? Or does White just not mind the thought of c4?
1220,33,43,2Qc7,b'r3rbk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/PP2P3/2P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Qc7. Planning c4 or cxb4? Moreover would it have worked better before the knight trade?
1221,33,44,2Rec1,b'r3rbk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1ppPp3/PP2P3/2P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R1R3K1 b - -',This at least helps against the cxb4 part. Obviously Rac1 wouldn't work because it loses a pawn after ...bxa4 at this point.
1222,33,45,2c4,b'r3rbk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/2P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R1R3K1 w - -',After Rec1 I agree with Kasparov that this is probably best for Black. c3's looking a bit weak for White but I be inclined to argue that if White plays a5 here Bb6 looks like a really good outpost for White's dark bishop! After all I can't say it's not doing much better on e3 and Black would be forced to move the queen again. There seems to be more that Deep Blue saw to this position than just winning Bb6 as an outpost but here is where I have to re-evaluate the position in White's favour again. I think after the knight trade White was able to use enough time to pierce a hold into Black's stronger part of the board and Black seems to be running out of more and more counterplay in the meantime.
1223,33,46,2Ra3,b'r3rbk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/2R3K1 b - -',For example Deep Blue thought it'd be a good idea to allow the rooks to be stacked down on the a-file while defending c3 and making both axb5 as well as a5 to be powerful moves by White. If Black tries to respond with bxa4 right now the rook stacking can still work after the bishop trade and a6 is left hanging.
1224,33,47,2Rec8,b'r1r2bk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/2R3K1 w - -',Given the previous comment now I'm wondering about this. I'm not sure what Kasparov saw but I'd be afraid of White entering through the a-file at this point. At the very least- wouldn't Reb1 have been better to help in some way in case axb5? Maybe Kasparov played with the idea of stranding c4 in his idea of the lines but I'm not sure if this was better for Black.
1225,33,48,2Rca1,b'r1r2bk1/2qb1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R5K1 b - -',The rooks are stacked now. White's looking vicious and ready to open the board now. It seems that White's planning axb5 instead of a5 now- if axb5 from Black then Rxa8 wins a rook for White and Black cannot play bxa4 at all anymore because once Bxa4 Black cannot avoid the bishop trade and White will win the rook threat again.
1226,33,49,2Qd8,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1QPP1/R5K1 w - -',So at least if White were to play axb5 right now only a6 is won because the queen will stop the rook from being dropped. Black is not good shape- this is the Queen's third time stuck on d8!
1227,33,50,2f4,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1ppn/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1PP2/R1P1B1NP/2B1Q1P1/R5K1 b - f3',And now f4 is played! Yet another fascinating move from Deep Blue. Again I'd be inclined to think that I would have liked to see the Queen on d2 for this. You know just in case f4 needed another defender in case Black were to play exf4 here.
1228,33,51,2Nf6,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/p2p1n1p/1p1Pp3/PPp1PP2/R1P1B1NP/2B1Q1P1/R5K1 w - -',Instead Kasparov plays this... and I have to wonder why. Won't White want to exchange on e5 now that Ng6 and Re8 aren't there anymore? Wouldn't f6 be better? It might expose the king and weaken the light squares around Kg8 but if White's pawn is stuck on d5 because d6 blocks it from moving I would think White's light bishop wouldn't be able to come in to threaten the king just yet.
1229,33,52,2fxe5,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/p2p1n1p/1p1PP3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1Q1P1/R5K1 b - -',As expected Deep Blue exchanges on e5. Now Black's Nf6 is being attacked.
1230,33,53,2dxe5,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/p4n1p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B1Q1P1/R5K1 w - -',Pretty much forced. White now has a surpassed pawn on the d-file and Black on the f-file. I think White's is clearly better thanks to the guard on e4 and e5 is left miserably lonely...
1231,33,54,2Qf1,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/p4n1p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B3P1/R4QK1 b - -',This sparks a move that has me wondering something. Deep Blue wasn't all that happy with the queen on e2? Neither was I because e4 was pretty well defended as is. I've been saying for some time now that I think 21. Qe2 wasted some of White's time.
1232,33,55,2Ne8,b'r1rqnbk1/3b1pp1/p6p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B3P1/R4QK1 w - -',Suddenly Black's knight retreats here. Okay probably because it wasn't attacking or defending anything on f6 so this all still makes some sense on Kasparov's part.
1233,33,56,2Qf2,b'r1rqnbk1/3b1pp1/p6p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',But now Qf2. That's two wasted moves on White's part to the Queen! What was so useful about Qe2 in the first place then? And why couldn't White have played Qf2 last turn? This Queen has been strengthening the dark bishop since the opening so what was the knight doing on f6 that had this Queen hopping about when Qd2 -> Qf2 was a straight shot? Why such a detour? If White wasted any tempo this match it was these two queen moves and I'm sure Kasparov could have capitalized on this if it weren't for the knight trade way back when... Those are just my thoughts.
1234,33,57,2Nd6,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/p2n3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P1B1NP/2B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Now IF White had not wasted those moves... then this would be too late. Kasparov knew that Nd6 now aids in the position. White had Rf1 and would have been able to play Qxf7+ by now. Instead Black has enough time to retreat this knight to not only defend f7 but also prevent White from gaining any ground by being able to advance on d6 at this point. If Kasparov had any chance of a draw I think here is where it all begins to look hopeful to recover again.
1235,33,58,3Bb6,b'r1rq1bk1/3b1pp1/pB1n3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P3NP/2B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',Now comes Bb6. Good because such an outpost can now be made possible via the White Queen instead of having to give up axb5. Again I'm thinking this is a consequence for Black due to not choosing Reb8 all that time ago but I also think White could have made this move sooner as a consequence for all those queen moves. (And I realize I'm repeating myself so I'm really hoping some of you higher players aren't yelling at me for my insolence right now... xD)
1236,33,59,3Qe8,b'r1r1qbk1/3b1pp1/pB1n3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/R1P3NP/2B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Qe8 - excellent another f7 defender and well needed at that. It also strengthens a possibility of playing bxa4 a combination I think Black may want to consider for now...
1237,33,60,3Ra3a2,b'r1r1qbk1/3b1pp1/pB1n3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/2P3NP/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',R3a2. Interesting. Did Deep Blue see a line where the b4 pawn and Nd6 knight move leaving the a3 rook under attack by Black's dark bishop?
1238,33,61,3Be7,b'r1r1q1k1/3bbpp1/pB1n3p/1p1Pp3/PPp1P3/2P3NP/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Be7 - If Black was never going to entertain the idea of f6 I guess he's doing it now. But I wonder if Black has any better moves. f6 now perhaps or is Kasparov worried about White playing Nf5 in response to that?
1239,33,62,3Bc5,b'r1r1q1k1/3bbpp1/p2n3p/1pBPp3/PPp1P3/2P3NP/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',Sure enough Deep Blue is tired of this game being so closed. Can't say I disagree- that bishop looks very secure on c5. If Black tries to move the knight away then White just plays Bxe7 forcing Qxe7 and the Queen has to take another move to defend anything of value; it will do nothing on e7.
1240,33,63,3Bf8,b'r1r1qbk1/3b1pp1/p2n3p/1pBPp3/PPp1P3/2P3NP/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Yeah Kasparov. Perhaps you shouldn't have moved the bishop and if Nb7 Kxf8 after Bxf8 wouldn't have been so bad. I think f6 should have been earlier and you're going to be punished for that.
1241,33,64,3Nf5,b'r1r1qbk1/3b1pp1/p2n3p/1pBPpN2/PPp1P3/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',Nf5 right now? I guess I don't see why not. Black is going to have to start giving away material either way. But with White threatening so much right now- axb5 or Bxd6 or maybe even Rf1 onto f7... I'm surprised that Deep Blue keeps confusing the matter with Kasparov. I'm really not that surprised that he was so exhausted mentally by this point. But could White do any better by acting on any of his threats right here instead of Nf5?
1242,33,65,3Bxf5,b'r1r1qbk1/5pp1/p2n3p/1pBPpb2/PPp1P3/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Why not Nxf5? With that bishop gone White is able to get away with axb5 even more now... and again I don't think the dark bishop is worth keeping anymore and Kxf8 doesn't look like a terrible square for the King to end up on...?
1243,33,66,3exf5,b'r1r1qbk1/5pp1/p2n3p/1pBPpP2/PPp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',Obvious- and that light bishop is looking scarier by the second.
1244,33,67,3f6,b'r1r1qbk1/6p1/p2n1p1p/1pBPpP2/PPp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',If Black doesn't play this right now White will do it and that would become problematic because gxf6 would be forced. Doubled pawns and an exposed King are the last thing Kasparov needs right now.
1245,33,68,3Bxd6,b'r1r1qbk1/6p1/p2B1p1p/1p1PpP2/PPp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',Deep Blue is just being terribly unforgiving right now. It's not letting Kasparov have any say in this matter at all and he even vocalizes being quite disturbed by the situation right here.
1246,33,69,3Bxd6,b'r1r1q1k1/6p1/p2b1p1p/1p1PpP2/PPp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',Poor Kasparov is getting forced move after forced move at this point.
1247,33,70,3axb5,b'r1r1q1k1/6p1/p2b1p1p/1P1PpP2/1Pp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 b - -',And here marks the pinnacle of stress for Kasparov. It took him some time to figure out this move. He wants to play e4 but isn't sure if e4 is going to work (after exchanging) should White play Be4 and then of course totally ignoring this exchange means he loses yet another pawn. How can he keep material in balance and if he can't how can he use a deliberately lost pawn to generate positional advantage? He starts focusing in on the move e4 and realizes that Black can pierce through into the center that way. What gets me is his reasoning after this...
1248,33,71,3axb5,b'r1r1q1k1/6p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp5/2P4P/R1B2QP1/R5K1 w - -',The thing is I don't know what took him so long to play this move! Just by looking earlier there was no way Black could just jump into e4 because he would be down more than just a pawn at that point. Now this is where things get controversial. REMINDER: Please DO NOT comment on the legitimacy of the game played. I don't think this is the place for it and I care slightly more about the rationale behind the moves being made. Kasparov believed for his own reasons that Deep Blue would get materialistic and play Qb6 eventually winning the b5 pawn. He had one major concern. Lo and behold the concern was played.
1249,33,72,3Be4,b'r1r1q1k1/6p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/R4QP1/R5K1 b - -',Be4. With this move Black is horribly confined and locked down into place. Kasparov keeps his b5 pawn (for now) but ultimately loses a lot of choices in play for the next while. The only open file Black can get into the game with is the same file where White has two stacked rooks and a Queen ready to invade. Kasparov loses a lot of composure here but there is still plenty to talk about from the moves that followed and those moves following this highly controversial one (but frankly... I can only think are the two only obvious moves as White) are why I'm annotating this game. I want to see what can be made of the endgame for Black following this point and onward.
1250,33,73,3Rxa2,b'2r1q1k1/6p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/r4QP1/R5K1 w - -',The rook on a8 has nothing better to do besides sacrifice itself. White cannot be allowed to have three rook-equivalents pressuring on the a-file. I seriously doubt Rab8 is worth playing... White would have Ra7 pressuring g7.
1251,33,74,3Qxa2,b'2r1q1k1/6p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/Q5P1/R5K1 b - -',Not Rxa2 as Qxa2 reaffirms White's absolute control of the only open file right now. Ra8 is also impossible for Black to play now.
1252,33,75,3Qd7,b'2r3k1/3q2p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/Q5P1/R5K1 w - -',Qd7? I suppose a last ditch effort to preserve the queen's mobility strength instead of confining her to the back rank; it also adds pressure to White's next move... an obvious one.
1253,33,76,3Qa7,b'2r3k1/Q2q2p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/6P1/R5K1 b - -',Qa7 - contesting the Black back ranks and demanding that some action take place to help the Black Queen's lack of defenses.
1254,33,77,3Rc7,b'6k1/Q1rq2p1/3b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/6P1/R5K1 w - -',And I guess Rc7 will stop a Queen trade but I wonder if leaving the back rank exposed is worth it? Is Qc7 planning Bxc7 after Qxc7 any better for Black? Qc7 is possible to stop White's next move...
1255,33,78,4Qb6,b'6k1/2rq2p1/1Q1b1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/6P1/R5K1 b - -',...which White can play now without much concern. This gives the White Queen a firm hold on the weak pawn and allows the rook to enter the back ranks.

There's yet another controversy on this move as well as it seems to be that Black's Queen could have a perpetual on the White King that wouldn't otherwise exist if White had just played Kh1. This will come up again in a moment. Once again I'm not interested in the comment of the computer's legitimacy- I'm concerning myself only with the draw outcome. Say if Kh1- is the draw completely averted right then and there?
1264,33,87,4Rb8,b'Rr6/5kp1/1qQb1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/6P1/5K2 w - -',Rb8- to forever remove the immediate threat of checkmate on e8 and chasing the rook away.
1265,33,88,4Ra6,b'1r6/5kp1/RqQb1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P4P/6P1/5K2 b - -',It instead comes here to help support the White Queen as well as attack the Black Queen. Kasparov at this point had had it and resigns in pure frustration. ---THE GAME ENDS HERE AND WHITE WINS--- but I'm going to continue a little bit longer to address a certain notation that was brought to Kasparov's attention in a restaurant after this game and I'm wondering if our better players can help me see if this truly was an actual drawn outcome after this. The combination I hear that Kasparov apparently had- it confuses me...
1266,33,89,4Qe3,b'1r6/5kp1/R1Qb1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P1q2P/6P1/5K2 w - -',Apparently as Kasparov was told it all begins here. Had he kept going and not resign the match Qe3 is threatening a perpetual on the White King. Black deliberately throws away the dark bishop- a move everyone was sure the computer would take but this would become a problem for White they were theorizing...
1267,33,90,4Qxd6,b'1r6/5kp1/R2Q1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P1q2P/6P1/5K2 b - -',So White is apparently forced to take this bishop here in order to preserve any winning chances. A very wonderful attack on the Black King appears but apparently according to the Kasparov team it was all going to happen only a move too late...
1268,33,91,4Re8,b'4r3/5kp1/R2Q1p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P1q2P/6P1/5K2 w - -',Here is my first question about the draw theory- Why is Re8 required? I can see Qd7 now being blockable mate probably completely averted after this. What I don't see is why doesn't the Black Queen now begin checking the White King probably starting on Qc1? What is stopping the perpetual checks after Qxd6 that it's necessary for Black to delay them with this move? If Kasparov truly had a draw I don't see why his team were recommending this move to him after the fact because the black rook itself doesn't seem to stop anything over on White's side of the board where the King rests.
1269,33,92,4Qd7+,b'4r3/3Q1kp1/R4p1p/1p1PpP2/1Pp1B3/2P1q2P/6P1/5K2 b - -',"I preface this by admitting that it was a Youtuber going by the name of ""kingscrusher"" who hints that the first move to secure Deep Blue's win would next play Qd7+ should Black try Re8. Apparently the Queen landing on Qd7 will allow White to play Qc6 after Black blocks the check with Re7. So it goes if Black tried Qc1 after 47 ...Re7 Qc6. Then White would be able to manage d6 eventually attacking the rook and forcing Mate in 11 after a perpetual ending with the King on d1 where Black plays Qxc3."

Here is where I'll end the annotation- too many combinations derive from the perpetuals to try to recreate. Did Kasparov have a draw here or is it theoretically possible for White to have stopped it? Thanks for reading the annotation for tolerating my lower-level opinions and I would love your feedback! :)

1286,34,15,2Rxg8,b'r1b3R1/ppp2p1k/6pp/8/2q2B2/6P1/P4PBP/Q5K1 b - -',
1287,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Popular as always. I've always been fond of e4 games regardless if I'm White or Black.
1288,35,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I throw out my Sicilian.
1289,35,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the Open Variation. (Closed is 2. Nc3). The irony is while this is the Open lines the position gets fairly locked up after about another 15 sets of moves...
1290,35,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I prefer the Dragon/Najdorf lines over the Orthodox line (2 ...Nc6).
1291,35,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And here White throws out Bb5+! This line is known as the Canal-Sokolsky (Moscow) Attack. [Coincidentally I found out that my opponent was Russian to my humour] This is a line I've wanted to explore myself as White and to deal with it as Black was actually pretty darn exciting on my end. When dealing with players who use the Najdorf I like my English Attack but I've been meaning to try this against players who either fend off that attack well or avoid it with a different Sicilian line entirely.
1292,35,5,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Anyway I block with the bishop. No sense blocking it in with the knight already.
1293,35,6,Bxd7+,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And he captures as expected.
1294,35,7,Nxd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is what Black normally plays in the main line but frankly given the way this game turned out in hindsight perhaps it'd have been better to capture with the Queen- you'll see why soon.
1295,35,8,b3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is not common. Normally when White plays Bb5+ after Nf3 the goal is to castle as soon as possible in order to capitalize on early development. This is a tactic commonly played in the Ruy Lopez. Instead my opponent starts a fianchetto on the dark bishop. This isn't necessarily a bad move and has performed well on the databases but I certainly wouldn't try this line myself.
1296,35,9,Ngf6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I had to explore the variants of the databases myself but in the end I decided this was the better move. This deters d4 and if Nc3 then it will surely hinder the eventual Bb2.
1297,35,10,d3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Likewise White plays this. I can't counterthreat with Bb4+ at all either.
1298,35,11,g6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I want my bishop out but Bg5 is playable after e6 so I counter with a fianchetto of my own.
1299,35,12,Bb2,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',As expected.
1300,35,13,Bg7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',And I continue my development.
1301,35,14,O-O,b'r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White opts to hide the kings away.
1302,35,15,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',I oblige; I want to see what he wants to do next.
1303,35,16,Nbd2,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',An OK move I think. Not sure if I'd have done this. White wants to bring the knight out but if Nc3 then you block the c-pawn and hinder the dark bishop. He is clearly planning c4 at some point.
1304,35,17,e5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - e6',I wasn't too sure what to do here honestly. White had a lot of good pawn moves- c3/c4 d4 and e5. This at least prevents e5 and d4 and gives me more control over the long dark diagonal.
1305,35,18,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N1P/PBPN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This probably wasn't the best of moves. Concerned about an attack on g4 but that clearly isn't going to help me after both light bishops got traded.
1306,35,19,1Nb8,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N1P/PBPN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And here is the gist of why I'm wondering if 4 ...Qxd7 would have been better for Black. I'm realizing now that my knight pair doesn't have a lot of good squares worth controlling where they were. Plus should White open the center now d6 was totally defenseless if the knight kept blocking the queen's access to it. One look at the board will clearly tell you that there is going to be a lot of queenside action soon so c6 would have been a better square for this knight all along.
1307,35,20,1c4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/1P1P1N1P/PB1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - c3',White finally plays this. My thoughts confirmed- I need to focus my attention to this side of the board now as he's clearly trying to seize control away from the kings at the moment.
1308,35,21,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/1P1P1N1P/PB1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Again we're seeing the sheer power of this knight instead of where it was on d7... d4 will remain in my control for a long time and should White try to form an attack on the c5 pawn via b4 I will have defenses ready for that moment.
1309,35,22,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/PP1P1N1P/1B1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White is clearly planning to form an attack on b4 not worried about me forming my own attack on b5 (defensible by playing a4 instead).
1310,35,23,1a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/p1np1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/PP1P1N1P/1B1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Maybe not the best move. I was planning to secure b5 hoping White declines so that I can play ...b4 myself. However that didn't quite go as I'd hoped...
1311,35,24,1Bc3,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/p1np1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/3N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White now has two defenders on b4.
1312,35,25,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/2np1np1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/3N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Now I realized that I've wasted another move- playing b5 right now would just allow an immediate b4 from White. I need to strengthen my grip on the square if I want to get my pawn there.
1313,35,26,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/2np1np1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/2QN1PP1/R4RK1 b - -',This was another adjusting move that I'm iffy about. You'll see what he's planning but I think this just gives me more time to re-adjust my part of the board myself.
1314,35,27,1Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/1p3pbp/2np2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/2QN1PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Which I immediately take advantage of. I was really mourning the poor placement of my knights at this point... I wasted far too much time trying to move everything where I wanted it.
1315,35,28,1Rab1,b'r2qnrk1/1p3pbp/2np2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/2QN1PP1/1R3RK1 b - -',White now has three defenders on b4.
1316,35,29,1Qb6,b'r3nrk1/1p3pbp/1qnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/2QN1PP1/1R3RK1 w - -',And here was where I started cursing out about 12 ...a6. If I had just played a5 back then my second knight would already have been helping defend b4 on my part.
1317,35,30,1Rb2,b'r3nrk1/1p3pbp/1qnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQN1PP1/5RK1 b - -',White is readjusting his defenses yet again...!
1318,35,31,1Nc7,b'r4rk1/1pn2pbp/1qnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQN1PP1/5RK1 w - -',...and it's only just barely enough time for me to get this last knight there...!
1319,35,32,1Rfb1,b'r4rk1/1pn2pbp/1qnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQN1PP1/1R4K1 b - -',Four defenders on b4! White's going all out on this one.
1320,35,33,1Na6,b'r4rk1/1p3pbp/nqnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQN1PP1/1R4K1 w - -',And after all my poor placements of pieces I get my final fourth defender on b4. Now let's re-evaluate the position. Black's pieces are well defended can move easily and I have enough space for maneuverability. White on the other hand has exhausted all resources available to aid an attack on just one square and will have a hard time moving out of that congestion if the attack fails to work. GK seems less sure of my argument about this stating that the position is mostly equal very slightly in favour of White.
1321,35,34,1Nf1,b'r4rk1/1p3pbp/nqnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R3NK1 b - -',White realizes that I have too many defenders on b4 and that if no other piece can enter that mass he cannot continue with the attack. He begins to plot a way for the knights to come in- which honestly at first glance looked almost impossible to me.
1322,35,35,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/1p3pbp/nqnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R3NK1 w - -',"This was my clear first mistake of the match. ""White cannot continue with the b4 attack with both my knights guarding that square with my pawns"" I thought. I figured the knights would not be able to somehow gain access to here that my queen no longer needed to stay on b6 (in danger against White's Rooks) and that I could resume my plan to steal the square from him in the first place."
1323,35,36,1Ne3,b'1r3rk1/1p3pbp/nqnp2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBPNN1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',The tragic part to all this is if I were to have an alternative move it would have been Bh6 planning to do Bxe3. I figured that if White had a knight here he'd be trying to move it to c2- I was waiting for him to move his own queen out of the way. I saw every square that a knight could help on b4 except ONE of them.
1324,35,37,1Qd8,b'1r1q1rk1/1p3pbp/n1np2p1/p1p1p3/2P1P3/PPBPNN1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Still not seeing it I moved my queen here hoping to free her and play b5 as soon as possible.
1325,35,38,2Nd5,b'1r1q1rk1/1p3pbp/n1np2p1/p1pNp3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',And... here is the fruit bared from my serious oversight. Every square- except for that one. Somehow in all the chaos White found entry and for once to his fortune I lacked too much tempo and too many defenders to do anything about it. b4 is now a possible attack...
1326,35,39,2b5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/n1np2p1/pppNp3/2P1P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 w - b6',After about a half day of thinking I decided that I couldn't keep trying to fight b4 in a closed center and I was hoping desperately that he wouldn't try to intercept this pawn's path to that square...
1327,35,40,2cxb5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/n1np2p1/pPpNp3/4P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',But c'est la vie. White's congested queenside is finally going to unravel the way he's been hoping for these past 20 moves. I'm in serious trouble here as now White can launch an attack that I can't counter by just defending anymore. If I can't advance some other ground and fast I will lose everything here and now.
1328,35,41,2Rxb5,b'3q1rk1/5pbp/n1np2p1/prpNp3/4P3/PPBP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Forced because both knights were forked by the pawn.
1329,35,42,2b4,b'3q1rk1/5pbp/n1np2p1/prpNp3/1P2P3/P1BP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',Now White finally launches his ultimate attacking plan. I spent another day carefully evaluating this position. Black is still in terrible shape and I need to work a way to use the chaos to my advantage.
1330,35,43,2f5,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n1np2p1/prpNpp2/1P2P3/P1BP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 w - f6',Finally I decide to fight chaos with even more chaos. White has too many defenders on b4 I thought. If I invite exchanges the way things look right now then I just give him a clear edge by exploiting that side of the board for the entire game. With this move I confuse matters further forcing White to make careful choices about how to clearly form an attack while several pieces on the board are being threatened at once. But GK hates this move stating that I have more of a chance being able to gain ground after triggering the exchanges. I didn't trust that way of thinking at the time. I felt that if I didn't threaten anything at all I would be forced to defend for the rest of the match until I eventually cave. 
1331,35,44,2bxa5,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n1np2p1/PrpNpp2/4P3/P1BP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',The reason why GK disagreed is because it states that Qb3 would win a rook after a discovered check (23. Qb3! cxd4!? Nc7+! Kh8 Nxb5). What I'm left wondering is why the heck does the computer think I'd not just play Kh8 first? If White tried playing bxa5 after this I would have Rxb3!!
1332,35,45,2Rxb2,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n1np2p1/P1pNpp2/4P3/P1BP1N1P/1rQ2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',At any rate my opponent probably was surprised about f5 and the declining of the exchanges so I was fine with him sparking them for me. I was too busy trying to figure out my own plans of attack at this point.
1333,35,46,2Rxb2,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n1np2p1/P1pNpp2/4P3/P1BP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/6K1 b - -',This was as far as the exchanges had to go from the b4 ordeal. Now I get another chance to start something... even more chaotic.
1334,35,47,2Nd4,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n2p2p1/P1pNpp2/3nP3/P1BP1N1P/1RQ2PP1/6K1 w - -',GK has a habit of not liking my chaos moves. It knocks me down another half point here for some unjustified reason but after this new set of exchanges it will open the board up a lot more. You're free to agree or disagree with me but I think in the end it gave me a much better overall shot at the game from this point on. I didn't want the board to be enclosed by pawns for the next part of my plan.
1335,35,48,2Nxd4,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n2p2p1/P1pNpp2/3NP3/P1BP3P/1RQ2PP1/6K1 b - -',Likewise White is uncomfortable with all the chaos and agrees to open the board.
1336,35,49,2exd4,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n2p2p1/P1pN1p2/3pP3/P1BP3P/1RQ2PP1/6K1 w - -',I'm eager so I dive for it.
1337,35,50,2Bd2,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n2p2p1/P1pN1p2/3pP3/P2P3P/1RQB1PP1/6K1 b - -',Forced because any other square either blocks the bishop or leads to capture.
1338,35,51,2fxe4,b'3q1rk1/6bp/n2p2p1/P1pN4/3pp3/P2P3P/1RQB1PP1/6K1 w - -',And now this capture gives me a beautiful looking reach on the f2 square! I know that White is going to start a plan to enter my back rank by rushing down the b-file sooner or later so while he's going to occupy his focus on the queenside I need to start any possible means of aggression on his kingside.
1339,35,52,2Rb6,b'3q1rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN4/3pp3/P2P3P/2QB1PP1/6K1 b - -',And lo and behold I was right on my thinking that he was going to act on this way soon.
1340,35,53,2Qh4,b'5rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN4/3pp2q/P2P3P/2QB1PP1/6K1 w - -',"So I start my portion of the attack exploiting the fact that the bishop was forced onto e2. 
"
1341,35,54,2g3,b'5rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN4/3pp2q/P2P2PP/2QB1P2/6K1 b - -',White now realizes that I have a mating attack on the f-pawn and starts to defend.
1342,35,55,2exd3,b'5rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN4/3p3q/P2p2PP/2QB1P2/6K1 w - -',So now I spark a Queen gambit. If White accepts and trades queens I was certain that my bypassed center pawns would allow me to regain my queen faster than he could recover his on a8.
1343,35,56,2Qxd3,b'5rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN4/3p3q/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 b - -',White realizes this as well and declines. Now I can retreat without losing the pawn.
1344,35,57,2Qh5,b'5rk1/6bp/nR1p2p1/P1pN3q/3p4/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 w - -',I play this nasty move. I threaten both Qd1+ or Qxd5. 
1345,35,58,3Rxa6,b'5rk1/6bp/R2p2p1/P1pN3q/3p4/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 b - -',And here we reach the point where I'm not sure if getting the Computer Analysis for this game helped me too much. The weird thing about everything in this game is since 27. Qh4 the Computer was saying that I was making several mistakes- not because my moves were bad ideas but rather my timing for these good moves was off. It says that I needed to swap my pawn off first allowing the knight to drop on a6 sooner and then start threatening mate by moving the Queen to h4. It was the same strategy I just deployed but I timed it differently. Now GK says I'm up +1.50 at this point and I can't say that out of all the chaos I sparked after playing f5 that it's helped me much since I played in more of an unorthodox fashion this game.
1346,35,59,3Qxd5,b'5rk1/6bp/R2p2p1/P1pq4/3p4/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 w - -',All I knew was that at this point Black had made a full recovery returning in full force back into the game. My pawns still occupying the center are definitely stronger than his pawns trying to reach promotion but his king was better protected than mine. I wasn't too sure if I had a secure winning edge but I was definitely far more hopeful about winning than after allowing b4 10 moves ago.
1347,35,60,3Ra7,b'5rk1/R5bp/3p2p1/P1pq4/3p4/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 b - -',White probably wasn't sure if he has a winning edge either but surely he was very concerned by my control of the center at this point. I imagine he figured that if he were to make an attack that would win him the game he needed to activate it now or else he'd need to purely launch defensive actions.
1348,35,61,3c4,b'5rk1/R5bp/3p2p1/P2q4/2pp4/P2Q2PP/3B1P2/6K1 w - -',And so it begins... I start walking my tightrope trying to plan my attack on f2 before he can plan one on my 7th rank. I start my efforts here exploiting the awkward placement of his bishop and queen.
1349,35,62,3Qe2,b'5rk1/R5bp/3p2p1/P2q4/2pp4/P5PP/3BQP2/6K1 b - -',The White Queen cannot stay on the 3rd rank so it retreats here planning Qe7.
1350,35,63,3Be5,b'5rk1/R6p/3p2p1/P2qb3/2pp4/P5PP/3BQP2/6K1 w - -',So I block her path to the 7th rank. Once again GK frustrates me- stating that I shouldn't have needed to worry about the queen-rook pair screaming mating threats on g7 and h7. But you know I only had every instinct in me as a chess player telling me that letting him do that was a bad idea!!!!! (For the record GK prefers c3 but I sure as hell didn't.)
1351,35,64,3Qg4,b'5rk1/R6p/3p2p1/P2qb3/2pp2Q1/P5PP/3B1P2/6K1 b - -',He plays this. I see that he's targeting d7 now and this time I don't think I can stop him.
1352,35,65,3Qf3,b'5rk1/R6p/3p2p1/P3b3/2pp2Q1/P4qPP/3B1P2/6K1 w - -',So I play this clamping down on the f-pawn and threatening mate if the Queen dares to go away. I was really sure that if White declines the queen exchange and moved her out that I could at least draw the game if not secure that if either side was going to be able to mate- that it'd be Black.
1353,35,66,3Qe6+,b'5rk1/R6p/3pQ1p1/P3b3/2pp4/P4qPP/3B1P2/6K1 b - -',And as I figured White plays this making one final push on a mate threat.
1354,35,67,3Kh8,b'5r1k/R6p/3pQ1p1/P3b3/2pp4/P4qPP/3B1P2/6K1 w - -',If I had allowed Qe7 from White I'd have been able to play Qf7 to block and exchange the rooks and Queens that way. But since I decided not to do that I'm forced to move my king in the corner. Rf7 and Qf7 both lose here.

It keeps the centre strong and closed; 2. an opened e-file would be much more useful to Black; 3. The half-opened g-file is very much in White's interest.  The fight develops into Black's effort to preserve the balance by attacking on the Q-side and in the centre; whilst White attacks the King directly and tries to hold the centre closed.

1447,38,17,Ne2+,b'8/p3k1pp/1b6/1P6/P2Pn1P1/3RQ2P/4nr2/6K1 w - -',et voilà... Coup de chance.
1448,39,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This game was played on a bitterly cold night in a big hall where the heating had failed.  We all started off in normal dress but by the end had donned extra jumpers and overcoats.  My opponent played at a normal slow rate but after my first few deliberate moves I sped up using his thinking time to plan my own moves.  This worked well until move 25 when I blundered and again thereafter so that by the time I'd equalised my opponent had only 15 minutes left compared with my 68 minutes.  However I wasn't in a mood to try to exploit my time advantage as I was in a hurry to find warmth ...
1449,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I've never really had a favourite system against the English Opening but this reply has been serving me well on Gameknot recently.
1450,39,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',aiming for King's Indian type position ...
1451,39,3,e4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq e3',I was quite surprised that White chose to block the position at this stage.
1452,39,4,Ne2,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/3P2P1/PP2NPBP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',I assumed this was aimed at an early f4 but that never came.  It could also have helped an advance to d4 leaving the B protecting e4 but that didn't come either so I'm not sure what the purpose of this rather than 6. Nf3 was.
1453,39,5,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2P1P3/3P2P1/PP2NPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Happy to develop my pieces to natural squares.

1456,39,8,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2npbp/2ppbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/P1NPB1PP/1P2NPB1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Another slow move.  While I was looking at launching a kingside attack it looked like White was preparing a queenside attack.
1457,39,9,Ne8,b'r3nrk1/pp1qnpbp/2ppb1p1/4p3/2P1P3/P1NPB1PP/1P2NPBK/R2Q1R2 w - -',Preparing ...f5.  12...Nh5 would have invited 13. g4 at this stage which wouldn't have helped me with my plan.
1458,39,10,1Rc1,b'r3nrk1/pp1qnpbp/2ppb1p1/4p3/2P1P3/P1NPB1PP/1P2NPBK/2RQ1R2 b - -',White continues with his quiet development.
1459,39,11,1f5,b'r3nrk1/pp1qn1bp/2ppb1p1/4pp2/2P1P3/P1NPB1PP/1P2NPBK/2RQ1R2 w - f6',and I continue with my planned assault.  My QR can stay where it is until it can double on the f file.
1460,39,12,1b4,b'r3nrk1/pp1qn1bp/2ppb1p1/4pp2/1PP1P3/P1NPB1PP/4NPBK/2RQ1R2 b - b3',White hopes to expand on the queenside and eventually queen a pawn I think. 
1461,39,13,1a6,b'r3nrk1/1p1qn1bp/p1ppb1p1/4pp2/1PP1P3/P1NPB1PP/4NPBK/2RQ1R2 w - -',I felt it was necessary to delay his advance before continuing with my kingside plan.

1463,39,15,Nh5,b'r4rk1/1p1qn1bp/p1ppb1p1/1P2pp1n/P1P1P3/2NPB1PP/4NPBK/2RQ1R2 w - -',With my pawn on f5 the N is safe on h5 and supports the next planned advance.
1464,39,16,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/1p1qn1bp/p1ppb1p1/1P2pp1n/P1P1P3/2NPB1PP/3QNPBK/2R2R2 b - -',A multi-purpose move supporting the queenside advance and discouraging ...f4 and threatening Bh6 to swap off my fianchettoed B.
1465,39,17,1d5,b'r4rk1/1p1qn1bp/p1p1b1p1/1P1ppp1n/P1P1P3/2NPB1PP/3QNPBK/2R2R2 w - -',Also multi-purposed.  It leads to a major swap-off that virtually clears the queenside of pawns and pieces.
1466,39,18,Qxd5,b'r4rk1/6bp/p5p1/3qpp1n/P7/3PB1PP/3QNP1K/2R2R2 w - -',I was quite happy with this position feeling that this left me with the better attacking options.
1467,39,19,2Rfc1,b'r4rk1/6bp/p2q2p1/2R1pp1n/P7/3PB1PP/3QNP1K/2R5 b - -',White beats me to doubling his rooks.  It looks like he may be able to outflank me before I can strike.
1468,39,20,2f4,b'r4rk1/6bp/p2q2p1/2R1p2n/P4p2/3PB1PP/3QNP1K/2R5 w - -',White has trapped his own B but has counter-attacking options.
1469,39,21,2Rc5c6,b'r4rk1/6bp/p1Rq2p1/4p2n/P4p2/3PB1PP/3QNP1K/2R5 b - -',and now I thought that I could just nick the B and ignore the attack on my Q as my pawn would also attack his Q but I was temporarily overlooking the forthcoming check from a2 even though I had previously considered its possibility.  This is the penalty for not taking enough time to think.
1470,39,22,2fxe3,b'r4rk1/6bp/p1Rq2p1/4p2n/P7/3Pp1PP/3QNP1K/2R5 w - -',?
1471,39,23,2Qa2+,b'r4rk1/6bp/p1Rq2p1/4p2n/P7/3Pp1PP/Q3NP1K/2R5 b - -',! Now White wins my Q.
1472,39,24,2Rxd6,b'r4r1k/6bp/p2R2p1/4p2n/P7/3Pp1PP/Q3NP1K/2R5 b - -',but I didn't resign as I worked out that I had some useful counter-attacking options that just might level the game up.
1473,39,25,Nxg3,b'r6k/6bp/p2R2p1/4p3/P7/3Pp1nP/Q3Nr2/2R3K1 w - -',I exploit the pin on the Ne2 to pinch a pawn and take up closer order with White's K.  Now I expected 29. Rc2 to relieve the pin and defend the N but White surprised me with ....
1474,39,26,2Re1,b'r6k/6bp/p2R2p1/4p3/P7/3Pp1nP/Q3Nr2/4R1K1 b - -',? White defends his pawn but leaves the N pinned.  This was after a long think ...
1475,39,27,2Raf8,b'5r1k/6bp/p2R2p1/4p3/P7/3Pp1nP/Q3Nr2/4R1K1 w - -',Part of my long-term plan now achieved and I have hopes of developing a mating net.
1476,39,28,3Qd5,b'5r1k/6bp/p2R2p1/3Qp3/P7/3Pp1nP/4Nr2/4R1K1 b - -',?! A strong centralising move that threatens to swap rooks on my back row - but it gives up the Ne2 allowing me to nearly equalise.
1477,39,29,3Rxe2,b'5r1k/6bp/p2R2p1/3Qp3/P7/3Pp2P/4Rr2/6K1 b - -',? allowing me to actually take a material lead on conventional scoring.
1478,39,30,Ref2,b'3R1r1k/6bp/p5p1/3Qp3/P7/3Pp2P/5r2/6K1 w - -',Restoring my strong rook formation and avoiding back row embarrassment.
1479,39,31,3Qe4,b'5r1k/6bp/p5p1/4p3/P3Q3/3Pp2P/8/6K1 b - -',Forcing me to choose between my two e-pawns.
1480,39,32,3Bh6,b'5r1k/7p/p5pb/4p3/P3Q3/3Pp2P/8/6K1 w - -',I save the more advanced pawn allowing White to capture on e5 with check if he so wishes in the hope that I can create counter-chances with the advanced pawn.
1481,39,33,3Qe7+,b'5r2/4Q1kp/p5pb/8/P7/3Pp2P/8/6K1 b - -',and White offered a draw which I gladly accepted as I was relieved not to have lost and didn't have the desire to freeze while trying to win.  He couldn't see a way of both developing a material  advantage and preventing my pawn from queening.
