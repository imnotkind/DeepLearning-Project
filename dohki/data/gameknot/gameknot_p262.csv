0,0,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black opts for the agressive sicilian line. Immediately it was tempting for me to accept a cramped position to avoid playing someone in their area of expertise but i considered the rating difference and went ahead with mainline stuff.
1,0,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is basically as far as my book knowledge goes in exact moves although i know the principles of attack for both sides. Black aims to pawn storm on the queenside and white tries to do the same on the kingside.
2,0,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I know black here normally plays a6 but for the life of me i couldn't remember what he got out of it. Possibly it is played to facilitate e5 so if he just accepts a more conservative e6 maybe it wins him a tempo?
3,0,3,g4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq g3',Pushing on the kingside. I decided to go for it as early a possible before i'd developed my pieces or got my king safe because i know how quick attacks normally come in the sicilian. note that to attack this unprotected pawn with his bishop black would have to lose a tempo by pushing the e pawn again (and i'd play Nf5).
4,0,4,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3pp1/p2ppn1p/8/3NPPP1/2N5/PPP4P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He ended up playing this pawn move anyway. Maybe he should've played it earlier and my pawns wouldn't look so strong in the middle if i let him play e5.
5,0,5,Qf3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3pp1/p2ppn1p/8/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',This move is strong because it stops black from pushing his b pawn and adds strength to all of white's pushed pawns.
6,0,6,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bpp1/p2ppn1p/8/3NPPP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This move serves no purpose other than preparing to castle my king. I was eager to get my rook on the semi open file opposing his queen.
7,0,7,b5,b'rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/3NPPP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq b6',b5?? This is black's first obvious mistake losing him material.
8,0,8,1e5,b'rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p2P3/3N1PP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Either the rook or the knight has to fall. The best move here would be Nd5 reducing black's material disadvantage to a pawn but the queen would be left on a powerful square threatening black's weakest pawn and his rook.
9,0,9,1d5,b'rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p3pn1p/1p1pP3/3N1PP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This is probably worst because at least if he loses his rook my attack will be delayed a bit. This way white can launch into an attack right out of the opening.
10,0,10,1Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/5pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBBQ2/PPP4P/R3K2R b KQkq -',White develops his last piece whilst black still has two minors in their starting blocks. 
11,0,11,1Bb7,b'rn1qk2r/1b3pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBBQ2/PPP4P/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black has no way of shifting the white pieces from d4 so this move is pretty pointless. Possibly better is Nd7 discouraging any further pawn pushes on white's kingside (specifically the f pawn or anything defended by the f pawn).
12,0,12,1O-O-O,b'rn1qk2r/1b3pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBBQ2/PPP4P/2KR3R b kq -',I saw a game recently where white castled kingside. Although in my position i've already pushed two of my pawns so it may be questionable arguably most of black's pieces are on the queenside whereas most of white's are on the kingside. Maybe a kingside castling would've worked here too.
13,0,13,1Nd7,b'r2qk2r/1b1n1pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBBQ2/PPP4P/2KR3R w kq -',Well played.
14,0,14,1Qg3,b'r2qk2r/1b1n1pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBB1Q1/PPP4P/2KR3R b kq -',A quiet move but not altogether bad. White moves his queen off a potentially vulnerable diagonal and adds another attacker to the g5 square he is about to try and claim whilst making all pawn pushes feasible again.
15,0,15,1Rc8,b'2rqk2r/1b1n1pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBB1Q1/PPP4P/2KR3R w k -',It's difficult to see what black should've played here. Clearly he needs to get his king safe but castling into all the white pieces is questionable. This move however achieves nothing.
16,0,16,Be7,b'2rqk2r/1b1nbpp1/p3p2p/1p1p4/3N1PPP/2NBB1Q1/PPP5/2KR3R w k -',Possibly clearing the way for his knight here. 
17,0,17,Nf8,b'2rqkn1r/1b2bpp1/p3p2p/1p1p2P1/3N1P1P/2NBB1Q1/PPP5/2KR3R w k -',Black tries to protect his king but removes any chance of castling. I was looking for a smothered mate here they make me feel clever but couldn't find one. I was by this stage already confident of a win though.
18,0,18,Rxh6,b'2rqkn2/1b2bpp1/p3p2r/1p1p4/3N1P1P/2NBB1Q1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Rxh6? Allows the f pawn to be pushed further striking out at the pawns right in front of the king.
19,0,19,1fxe6,b'2rqkn2/1b2bpp1/p3P3/1p1p4/3N3r/2NBB1Q1/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',White takes the correct pawn. If black retakes he severely weakens a diagonal leading into his king. If he doesn't exf7 does the job instead.
20,0,20,1fxe6,b'2rqkn2/1b2b1p1/p3p3/1p1p4/3N3r/2NBB1Q1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Look at all the pieces between my rook and black's queen. This game perfectly demonstrates the vulnerability an xray attack here despite any apparent strength.
21,0,21,2Nf3,b'2rqkn2/1b2b1p1/p3p3/1p1p4/7r/2NBBNQ1/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',This move sets a trap.
22,0,22,2d4,b'2rqkn2/1b2b1p1/p3p3/1p6/3p3r/2NBBNQ1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Has black fallen for it?
23,0,23,2Rhf1,b'2rqkn2/1b2b1p1/p3p3/1p6/3p3r/2NBBNQ1/PPP5/2KR1R2 b - -',"I love this game because here things are looking not altogether horrible for black if you look at it from his side of the board. His king is fairly exposed with no safe home but he's just managed to go up in material for the first time in the game and he'll have a very powerful pawn just two moves away from promotion. 

Just see how passive this move looks. Beautiful!"
24,0,24,2dxe3,b'2rqkn2/1b2b1p1/p3p3/1p6/7r/2NBpNQ1/PPP5/2KR1R2 w - -',"Yep. The bait is taken. This move unleashes an attack on black that is quite literally unstoppable.

(also note that he was looking to put his pawn on e2 for another fork here but better would've been taking the knight winning him another pawn for his rook and opening a channel into the white king for his bishop. Not that black ever had the time to move his pawn again in this match.) "

Black does have one spite check on g2 or h2 but the white king can go to a3 avoiding further checks.  Black can only delay mate on h7 by sacrificing his queen.  Black realised this and I was greeted with the white flag and found myself 3.1 rating points better off when I arrived home from work today!!

Just a personal thing but I'd rather make the non-committal move and allow my opponent the option to make a bad move.  In hindsight black could play e5 here which d4 would prevent.
354,15,5,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/3q1n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Standard development.

357,15,8,d4,b'rnb1kb1r/1pp1pppp/p2q1n2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',Time to give the queen's bishop an out (it's clear that a fianchetto would be a bad move) and to step up my presence in the center.  White's looking pretty good so far.

With his queenside a mess like that I owe it to myself to put as much pressure on the center/kingside as possible since that's where his king will be.  This also keeps the d- and e-files clear for heavy pieces after 0-0.

Notice how black has no good place to put his bishop on f8 because the Qd6 blocks it in.  He clearly can't castle queenside and so it looks like if I hurry I can get him with his king trapped in the center.

422,19,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',As a Caro-Kann player I do not like facing the Panov Attack as Black often has to find some very accurate moves just to make it to the middlegame. However if he can survive the endgame should be better for him.
423,19,1,cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',An unusual move; Bg5 or Nf3 are usually played here.
424,19,2,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1B1n4/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I think that 7...Nxc3 8.bxc3 Qd5 which led to a Black victory in Shamkovich-Adianto 1994 would have eased my defensive task significantly and made my next few moves easier. White would no longer have an isolated pawn but the weakness would simply be transferred from d4 to c3.
425,19,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1B1n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White now gains firm control of the e5 square and this clamp makes it very difficult for Black to complete his development naturally.
426,19,4,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/1B1n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Given time I would have liked to have played ...Qc7 which is often thematic in the Caro-Kann to keep the White bishop off of f4 but I needed to get my king out of the center ASAP.
427,19,5,1Nxd5,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/1B1N4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Now White's bishop can come to f4 whenever it wants to control the important h2-b8 diagonal.
428,19,6,1Re1,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Hitting e5 again.
429,19,7,Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2b2b2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',In additional to clearing the e file for the rook to push the queen off this move had another point - it was obvious that White was playing for Ne5. From this square the bishop could snap off the knight if it became intolerable.
430,19,8,1Ne5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1qb2b2/3pN3/3P1B2/8/PP1Q1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Taking the knight now would be a mistake because the bishop would bear down on g7 and my dark squared bishop is currently the only piece defending my kingside since the other bishop is shutting my queen out.
431,19,9,1b4,b'r3r1k1/1p3pp1/1qb2b1p/p2pN3/1P1P1B2/P7/3Q1PPP/R3R1K1 b - b3',I fully expected White to play 18.Bxh6 here with two pawns and a raging attack on my king. This move gives me some play on the queenside and a little breathing room.
432,19,10,2Rxa8,b'R3r1k1/1p3pp1/2b2b1p/1q1pN3/1P1P1B2/8/3Q1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Although wanting my rook off of the e-file is understandable there was no reason to hand me the a-file on a platter.

I was happy to see this move as the more pieces off the board the better.
435,19,13,2Qe5,b'6k1/1p1b1pp1/6rp/1q1pQ3/1P1P4/8/3B1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',This move more or less forces the rooks off the board but by this point White cannot idly maneuver and hope for slow pressure - Black is starting to develop a few threats of his own such as fishing for holes in the kingside with ...Bh3.
436,19,14,2Qc7,b'8/1pQ2ppk/4b2p/1q1p4/1P1P4/8/3B1PPP/6K1 b - -',Perhaps this is technically an endgame but it takes on the character of a late middlegame because the opposite colored bishops each aiming at the enemy's king keep things sharp.
437,19,15,2Qe2,b'8/1pQ2ppk/4b2p/3p4/1P1P4/8/3BqPPP/6K1 w - -',This move doesn't set up any specific threats other than the obvious one move attack on the bishop but I felt that it could be useful to have my queen as close to the White king as possible in case I could set up threats later.
438,19,16,g6,b'8/1p3p1k/4b1pp/3p4/1P1P4/8/2QBqPPP/6K1 w - -',Clearly this was a risky policy as my kingside is weaker than his. 
439,19,17,h5,b'8/1p3p1k/4b1p1/3p3p/1P1P4/8/3BqPPP/2Q3K1 w - -',I'm not sure about this move which really weakens my dark squares - not what I want! I wanted to block in his bishop with 31...g5 but then 32.h4 looks strong. How else to defend the h pawn though? Defending it with the Queen invites 32.Qc7. However in such a case I could have simply brought my Queen back to e2 and followed this up with ...b5. This probably would have been the best choice for me.
440,19,18,g5,b'5B2/5p1k/4b3/1p1p2pp/1P1P4/8/4qPPP/2Q3K1 w - -',The only move to avoid mate.

After looking it up on the web I found a quote I liked. Apparently one Graham Burgess (of whom I know nothing) has said ""Is not utterly clearly bad.""."

A possible continuation is 8. ... Qxg5 9. Bxg5  Be7 10. Bxe7  Nxe7 11. Bb3
and white should be better. Lead in development and control of the center.  The black king is stuck in the center and white still has the ability to castle. I think I'll try it in a few games."

On d4 the White Knight controls some squares but Black's pieces have very little interest in them. However it serves as a target for Black's more tactical ideas like ...Ng4 and ...Nxe4. So really at this point the White Knight kind of exists in a limbo between good and bad and the way that the game shapes up really determines its status.
Now Black's Knight on c6 facilitates these tactical ideas and blocks the pawn on e4's advance to e5. White would really like to play e5 and then f4 to start his kingside pawns rolling towards Black's eventual castle.
So basically after taking the Knight on c6 White should plan to play e5 and drive Black's Knight on to an awkward square and launch his pawn storm."

Going forward I strongly recommend a few points to you. 
1. Try to play one recognised opening all the time. Get to know the reason for those moves recognise the positions that arise understand the strength and weakness of those positions. This will help you play to a plan through the opening and into the middle game. 
2. Write down the moves you are considering. Note the good/bad points you see for each move. Turn the board and look at each move from the other side. Most important double check your move is not a blunder BEFORE you submit it.
3. Stop moving pawns unless/until there is a definite advantage on offer. Think of  your pawns as a power unit much stronger side-by-side a team that offer mutual support weak when isolated or forward. When you are tempted to move a pawn now look hard at piece moves that strengthen your position look for weaknesses on the otherside that you can exploit even indirectly. Pay attention to your overall position.
4. Give more time and concentration to your moves. In practice you may need to analyse with particular care and depth at particular times in every game. For example at the end of a familiar opening sequence when your opponent makes an unexpected move when you make a mistake if you get a sense that there is an opportunity or challenge and of course when you are not sure what to do.

In this case the logic is not apparent to me and it shows you not following through the plan you initiated with move 3. Bb5  In summary the move is not especially bad but you broke a few tips - always play to a plan (even a bad plan is better than no plan) - and avoid moving pieces more than once to reach their development square. The result - loss of a tempo

Obviously Qxf3 is the threat but you want N on g3 right ! which unblocks your Q and R and defends f3. Always think carefully before pushing pawns.

Do not wander off the normal moves unless your opponent varies first. If he does - check the popular responses in the Gameknot DB and figure out why/what/reason that move is good. In the other games I looked at you were inclined to make the odd blunder in this game just a few weak moves. I think you need a check routine before each move to elliminate blunders/weak moves among the moves you consider. You might also benefit from a check routine/plan that takes up after the opening phase to give your play some focus.
