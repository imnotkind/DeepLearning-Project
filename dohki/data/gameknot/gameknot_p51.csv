Kd8 is recommended instead though that pretty much only delays the inevitable at this point.  Kd8 Nf7+ and the king must return to e8 where the queen checkmates.

Black lost the queen and both rooks to knight forks.  The lesson here is to watch out for knight forks.  How best to prevent these?

142,6,7,Ng6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b1p1nn1/pP2p3/P1B1P3/2PP1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This is the most effective square for the knight looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push. 
143,6,8,1Ba2,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b1p1nn1/pP2p3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This moves makes a lot of sense. This makes the c4 square available for both the c-pawn or the knight to press harder on the queen side. Additionally with the bishop on a2 instead of b3 it allows the a-rook to have more control over the b-file after Rb1. 
144,6,9,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b3nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This move also makes a lot of sense. The pawn on d5 attacks e4 while also preventing the knight from coming to c4.

148,6,13,h6,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp2nnp/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',A couple of simple development moves followed by this prophylactic move of h6 just to make sure that nothing can get on g5.

150,6,15,1dxe4,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp2nnp/pP2p3/P1P1p3/3P1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',This seems more reasonable than 15...dxc4 which could follow up with 16. Nxc4 Bc7 and it seems that whites position is very comfortable.

154,6,19,Qe7,b'r1b1r1k1/1p2qpp1/2p3np/pPb1p3/P1P1P3/4BN2/B1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',Both sides are now just finishing development.

156,6,21,2Qc3,b'r1b1r1k1/1p3pp1/2p3np/pPq1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2N2/B4PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',Curious I would have probably just played something like h3. However this move looks to get the queen to e3 and get more control over the c5 square.  
157,6,22,2Nf4,b'r1b1r1k1/1p3pp1/2p4p/pPq1p3/P1P1Pn2/2Q2N2/B4PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',Planning to hop the knight over to e6 to defend the queen after Qe3.

Qd3 Qe5 with the idea of solidifying the d4 pawn with c5 appears uncomfortable for white. But of course f6 is logical solidifying the e5 pawn.  
160,6,25,2Red1,b'r1b1r1k1/1p4p1/2p1np1p/pPq1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2N2/B4PPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Logical occupying the open d-file.

163,6,28,2g3,b'r1b1r3/6pk/2p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2NP1/B4P1P/1R1R2K1 b - -',Preventing the knight from coming to f4.

165,6,30,2Ne1,b'1r2r3/6pk/b1p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q3P1/B4PKP/1R1RN3 b - -',This move makes sense as the knight aims to go to d3. 
166,6,31,Rd8,b'3r4/6pk/b1p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q3P1/B4PKP/1R2N3 w - -',But now that black has exchanged the b-rooks it is clear that this plan doesn't work out since now if the knight goes to d3 black can play Qd4! and white has too many weaknesses.  
167,6,32,2Nf3,b'3r4/6pk/b1p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2NP1/B4PKP/1R6 b - -',So white just relocates the knight back to f3 in order to defend the pivotal d4 square. 
168,6,33,2Bc8,b'2br4/6pk/2p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2NP1/B4PKP/1R6 w - -',This makes sense as the bishop has better prospects on this diagonal.
169,6,34,3Rb2,b'2br4/6pk/2p1np1p/p1q1p3/P1P1P3/2Q2NP1/BR3PKP/8 b - -',Creeping up to b2 with the idea of swinging over the d2 and challenge the d-file. 
170,6,35,3Ng5,b'2br4/6pk/2p2p1p/p1q1p1n1/P1P1P3/2Q2NP1/BR3PKP/8 w - -',Again it seems that Nd4 is more natural here. But this practically forces white to exchange knights because of the threat of Bh3+. 
171,6,36,Be6,b'3r4/6pk/2p1bp2/p1q1p1p1/P1P1P3/2Q3PP/BR3PK1/8 w - -',Now black is threatening some serious stuff here - Qd4 looks quite painful  for white. At this point it is clear that white is at a positional disadvantage. 
172,6,37,3Qf3,b'3r4/6pk/2p1bp2/p1q1p1p1/P1P1P3/5QPP/BR3PK1/8 b - -',Targeting the h5 square but black can prevent this easily with Kh6/Kg6. 
173,6,38,Rh8,b'7r/6p1/2p1bpk1/p1q1p1p1/P1P1P3/5QPP/BR3PK1/8 w - -',Now white must play g4 provoking more potential weaknesses in the white position. 
174,6,39,c5,b'3r4/1R3bp1/5pk1/p1p1p1p1/P1PqP1P1/Q6P/B4PK1/8 w - -',Instead of grabbing the e4 pawn right away black just continues to ensure that white can not possibly generate any counter play. That is what all of these next moves ensure as well. 
175,6,40,Kh6,b'3rb3/6p1/1R3p1k/p1p1p1p1/P1PqP1P1/5Q1P/2B2PK1/8 w - -',Why should black even bother taking the pawn after all? Just remain patient and everything will be just fine.
176,6,41,Bg6,b'3r4/6p1/2R2pbk/p1p1p1p1/P1PqP1P1/1Q5P/2B2PK1/8 w - -',Again no need to take on c4 right awayor else white might still be able to generate a counter attack by striking at the a or c pawn.
177,6,42,Qxc4+,b'8/2R3p1/5pbk/p1p1p1p1/P1qrP1P1/1Q5P/2B2P2/5K2 w - -',Now that all possible attempts at a counter-attack by white have been quenched it is time for black to convert the positional advantage into a material advantage. 
178,6,43,5Bb3,b'8/2R3p1/5pbk/p1p1p1p1/P1r1P1P1/1B5P/5P2/5K2 b - -',Even now we can see that whites bishop just doesn't have a good place to go. Blacks bishop is so much more active and white will soon have to give up the e-pawn as we'll.
179,6,44,5f3,b'8/2R3p1/5p1k/p3p1p1/Prp1b1P1/5P1P/8/3BK3 b - -',White can't allow the bishop on to g2 so this is necessary. Although it does give room for the black rook to get in from b2 to h2 and attack the h3 pawn.
180,6,45,5Rc5,b'8/6p1/5p1k/p1R1p1p1/P1p3P1/2Kb1P1P/7r/3B4 b - -',Now white does have an opportunity to snag the a5 pawn but white won't have much of a problem from stopping the passed a4 pawn.  
181,6,46,Rh2+,b'8/R5p1/5pk1/4p1p1/P1p3P1/3b1P2/3K3r/3B4 w - -',Now it is clear that the room can just go to a2 and crush any idea white may have of getting the a-pawn promoted.
182,6,47,f5,b'8/R5p1/P5k1/4ppp1/2p3P1/r2b1P2/3K4/3B4 w - -',Played with he idea of creating a passed f-pawn.
183,6,48,Bxe4,b'R7/P5p1/6k1/6p1/2p1bpP1/r7/3K4/3B4 w - -',It seems that maybe white might have a slight chance due to the fact that black has doubled pawns. But black will not have much of a problem as long as it is played correctly. 
184,6,49,6Rxc4,b'8/r5p1/6k1/6p1/2R1bpP1/8/3K4/3B4 b - -',This is about as much as white could hope for. But unfortunately for white there are not enough resources to defend.
185,6,50,7Be2,b'8/3r2p1/5k2/2Rb2p1/5pP1/8/4B3/4K3 b - -',White must now just focus on keeping all of his pieces on the board. Any exchange (except for a rook exchange) will prove to be fetal for white.

After the bishops are exchanged all black has to do is get white in a position in which the white king is blocked off from stopping the passed f-pawn while also being in a situation where the white rook is restricted to prevent the black king from advancing any farther. 
187,6,52,7Bf3,b'8/6p1/3r1k2/2R3p1/5pP1/3b1B2/5K2/8 b - -',So white must hold on to the bishop as long as possible to make things more complicated.

191,6,56,Re3,b'8/5k2/6p1/6R1/3K1pP1/4r3/8/8 w - -',After good maneuvering by black this endgame has been converted. The white king now has no shot at stopping the f pawn because of the rook on the e-file and the white rook can't move off the 5 column  or the black king can advance and capture the g4 pawn. 
192,6,57,f3,b'8/8/5kp1/R7/3K2P1/5p2/8/4r3 w - -',And after 100 moves white has finally resigned since the f pawn simply can't be stopped. Black took control over the board early - practically stopping white from coming up with any sufficient defense despite white's best efforts.

I guess it's trial and error because when I've played 1.d4 they've responded not even with the Benoni but rather KID after which I have no idea what to do.

Plus that pawn is right near the K and generally I hold off until later because maybe I misunderstood which frequently happens but I seem to remember Jack telling that opening that pawn right around the K this early often leaves vulnerable to exposure in the long run.  But I also know that white has a plan behind it and it'll be interesting to see that tactical motif as that's often the plan.  In fact tactical motifs as I recently learned is more powerful then strategy.

The idea is get rid of the stronger bishop pair.  And I disagree with what I was told in the past because I go solely by what I learn from Jack.  That since black's is on his color his DSB that's his dominant B.  Whereas white's DSB is the weak B since it's not on the color he's playing.  So this is a good strategy.

In this position it is since white would immeidately win the Q by trapping it after 19.Reb1 so that it would have no place to go.  Beleive it or not that's how I won a second game against Jack but I consider to be a good win because in first one it wasn't good.  That was just luck which you can't go by.  After having had made a ton of blunders even after winning a R he went to show me a move and what he could but missed that the other was en-prise so I was able to take it and once I did he resigned.  But in the second game by thinking and planning ahead and not making mistakes I was able to trap his Q.  I almost missed the move and Jack wanted the game to end and was thus testing me to see if I found the right move as you typically see with GM's.  But this time I passed his test with flying color and found the winning move.  He wasn't surprised but impressed that I found it.  After which I also kept improving unlike the first time where my rating was around 900.  But that's also because that second win also happened to me after my epic and historic game against him which I consider to be the most important game I've ever played as that's where I also learned how helpful chess in life."

This is good because one thing that Jack mentioned is that when connecting R's you generally don't want them on the same color since the opponent could fork both with his or her B and since it is the LSB and the R's were on the white colors that feability in the long run did exist.

Yes we do have a passed pawn on the e file but now he's going for a second passed pawn which is about to happen as black will not have pawn in front of white to interfere with a passage thus making it a passed pawn.

Instead I would've played 66...Kh6 to make the K a powerful weapon as it would support the g pawn against his h pawn since that passed pawn is more dangerous then the e pawn.

As chesskingdom64 would put it ""Almost any move was better then this.""  That's because the R would've kept the pawn safe.

331,7,138,7Rh8,b'7r/1p3pk1/p1b3p1/6P1/3R1P1P/P7/BP1K4/8 w - -',Going for whites h file especially since this is the dangerous passed pawn.  Unfortunately there is nothing that white can do about it this time which proves that I was right earlier as someone implied that passed pawns could never be stopped but I always knew better from a different commentator earlier.  And this is an example which shows that even the most dangerous passed pawns by defintion can be stopped.
332,7,139,7Rd6,b'7r/1p3pk1/p1bR2p1/6P1/5P1P/P7/BP1K4/8 b - -',So white prepared by putting pressure on the sixth rank.

336,7,143,7Bd5,b'4b3/1p3pk1/p4Rp1/3B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P1K4/8 b - -',And now with the the threat on the b pawn.
337,7,144,7b5,b'4b3/5pk1/p4Rp1/1p1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P1K4/8 w - b6',The obvious response.
338,7,145,7Ke1,b'4b3/5pk1/p4Rp1/1p1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P6/4K3 b - -',I don't why he moved his K back.
339,7,146,7a5,b'4b3/5pk1/5Rp1/pp1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P6/4K3 w - -',Trying to strengthen his pawn structure of it's own accord.  However this does the opposite as it breaks up the pawn chain and makes it difficult to near impossible to get another due to white's pawn chain on the same files and now close to the same rank.
340,7,147,7Kf2,b'4b3/5pk1/5Rp1/pp1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P3K2/8 b - -',Still don't know why he played this.
341,7,148,7Rh3,b'4b3/5pk1/5Rp1/pp1B2P1/5P2/P6r/1P3K2/8 w - -',Almost pointless but if he wanted to put pressure on the K I understand.  However best was 79...Rh2+ which would a pawn for when white gets out black would have 80...Rxb2  So I would've played 79...Rh2+ if I were black.
342,7,149,8Bf3,b'4b3/5pk1/5Rp1/pp4P1/5P2/P4B1r/1P3K2/8 b - -',I believe to keep his pawn chains strong.
343,7,150,8Bd7,b'8/3b1pk1/5Rp1/pp4P1/5P2/P4B1r/1P3K2/8 w - -',To support black's R since the B adds protection as they're adjacent to the same file.  Meaning run along the same lines as the B covers 6 squares from c8 to h3 and with the R on h3 this works very well.  Remember another important concept as easy19 told me earlier is to count how many squares your B covers.  Now I had trouble remembering and never thought it was important especially after what WB taught which was theory and then the 7 point checklist as you learned from GM Kasporov because archduke_piccolo covered it in the consultation thread for the group he mentored in the WTWLTR club.  And it was also soemthing that elyhim emphasized so I studied that.  But then I spoke to WB and he said how many squares the B covers is also a very important part of theory.  The reason it was never covered is that it's much more basic and because his club was The Deeper Chess Theory Club he was going over things much more advanced.  But he recommended that I go over the basic parts despite the disagreement with easy19 so I went back and it finally makes sense.  It goes by which square those B covers.  The max you'd see is after a fianchetto where you put it on the longest diagnol and then it would cover 8 squares.  But I realize now from experience that it espeically matters in end games.  That's one thing I kept in mind in my last game against Ted and won with the last move being mate and I kept in mind how many squares my DSB covered.
344,7,151,8Kg2,b'8/3b1pk1/5Rp1/pp4P1/5P2/P4B1r/1P4K1/8 b - -',The idea is that now the K is a weapon since we're in an endgame.  And now it is doing a lot of damage.
345,7,152,8Bd5,b'8/3b1pk1/5Rp1/pp1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P4K1/8 b - -',And afterwards this is where things heat up.  Black's f pawn is in danger so now it will be difficult to defend.
346,7,153,8Be6,b'8/5pk1/4bRp1/pp1B2P1/5P1r/P7/1P4K1/8 w - -',The only move as anything else loses the B.  Instead it will become an exchange.
347,7,154,fxe6,b'8/6k1/4pRp1/pp4P1/5P1r/P7/1P4K1/8 w - -',But white can still win a pawn.
348,7,155,8Kg3,b'8/6k1/4pRp1/pp4P1/5P1r/P5K1/1P6/8 b - -',The idea is to make the K a more powerful.  However I would've immediately played 84.Rxe6 to win the e pawn but this option is still avaliable.
349,7,156,8Rh1,b'8/6k1/4pRp1/pp4P1/5P2/P5K1/1P6/7r w - -',I would've played 84...Rh8 and worth noting that not only is the R safe but like this move it dosen't compromise his mobility and as we know mobility is the most important aspect of chess.
350,7,157,8Rxe6,b'8/6k1/4R1p1/pp4P1/5P2/P5K1/1P6/7r b - -',As noted white now has a free pawn.  And with it while not immidetialy it is a guaranteed win for him.
351,7,158,8Rb1,b'8/6k1/4R1p1/pp4P1/5P2/P5K1/1P6/1r6 w - -',He wants the b pawn and pressure on that file.
352,7,159,8Re7+,b'8/4R1k1/6p1/pp4P1/5P2/P5K1/1P6/1r6 b - -',But white has other ideas.
353,7,160,8Kg8,b'6k1/4R3/6p1/pp4P1/5P2/P5K1/1P6/1r6 w - -',Obviously.

357,7,164,8Kf3,b'6k1/8/6p1/6P1/1p3P2/5K2/1P2R3/1r6 b - -',I would've played 89.Kg4 to support the pawns.  Worth noting is that more often then not one of the main things that makes the K dangerous in the endgame is when it goes in between those pawns as that's where it does a lot of damage in part by strengthening the pawn chain.  However this move is better because of what's about to unfold.
358,7,165,8Kf7,b'8/5k2/6p1/6P1/1p3P2/5K2/1P2R3/1r6 w - -',No longer pointless because like white his K is also a weapon.  And with this move black now has the opposition which is important.
359,7,166,9Ke4,b'8/5k2/6p1/6P1/1p2KP2/8/1P2R3/1r6 b - -',Continuting to strengthen the K.  I now understand why he didn't play Kg4 and I actually I like this position much better believe it or not.
360,7,167,9Ke6,b'8/8/4k1p1/6P1/1p2KP2/8/1P2R3/1r6 w - -',Maintaining the opposition.
361,7,168,9f5+,b'8/8/4k1p1/5PP1/1p2K3/8/1P2R3/1r6 b - -',"But he missed this check which happens to be very nasty.  As HW Jack has made me study these kinds of position and tested me to see what the best move which I failed multiple times.  I didn't pass but I finally had the solution.  The solution (answer) is putting your opponent in check with the pawn as we see here leaving the K aside.  This is the perfect example as I don't how to explain it well.  So looking at this particular position the K is on e4 with the pawn right next to it on f5 checking the K on e6 so the idea then is that the P+K work right next to one another so that you place him or her in check with that pawn.  At the time however I didn't pass any tests until I did the one thing that I emphasize to students.  It's using the analyze the board and when I take various quizzes I apply the same concept.  And sometimes if I've missed things outside of GK I will put the position on practice and then study as it still qualifies as Analyze the Board.  And nowadays I apply the same concept of what you see in Analyze just by looking and seeing all threats because analyzing is something else that the Mater implies by ""Be a spectator""  That's because in order to see everything on the board as opposed to one or two things you really have to analyze which is why it is a very good feature to get used to.

362,7,169,9gxf5+,b'8/8/4k3/5pP1/1p2K3/8/1P2R3/1r6 w - -',Normally this would be ideal because of what I noted earlier but white has a plan that black overlooked which will leave him in worse shape because it loses another pawn.
363,7,170,9Kf4+,b'8/8/4k3/5pP1/1p3K2/8/1P2R3/1r6 b - -',The discovered check.
364,7,171,9Kf7,b'8/5k2/8/5pP1/1p3K2/8/1P2R3/1r6 w - -',He also could've played 92...Kd5 or 92...Kd6 but with this move white regains the opposition.  
365,7,172,9Kxf5,b'8/5k2/8/5KP1/1p6/8/1P2R3/1r6 b - -',But as I was alluding to earlier no matter how black got out the check was serious as white was going to play this one way or another.
366,7,173,9Rf1+,b'8/5k2/8/5KP1/1p6/8/1P2R3/5r2 w - -',"You might as well just place white in check.  As Jack once said right before I mated him and he took the piece he said ""I might as well take since I have nothing else to do.""  This was true because no matter what else he did I had a mate in one anyway.  Well even though there's no mate in one and he didn't take the same thing applies here since white has a win here."
367,7,174,9Ke5,b'8/5k2/8/4K1P1/1p6/8/1P2R3/5r2 b - -',94.Ke4 was also an option.
368,7,175,9Rg1,b'8/5k2/8/4K1P1/1p6/8/1P2R3/6r1 w - -',Going for the pawn.  Normally there wouldn't be much meaning as a move would be played for an attack but not in this position.  Since white has a win black's getting aggressive.  And unlike what happened in the WTWLTR club now it is safe to have that defeasitic attitude.  This works as long as there's no immediate as that's when you would have to think defensive as opposed to aggressive.  But there's no immediate danger you might as well do anything to stay in.  It's better then getting nervous which is something I also used to do which is where the Fight or Flight syndrome as I talked about kicks in.  Instead black's confidence is increasing that is going to help him even in a situation like this.  As a matter of fact there was a time where I was even more lost then what happened in my first game ubermensch.  It happened against Jack which is why I keep boasting despite stronger players playing me to see how well I'll do.  It holds me back shortly but not for long.  But in a game against Jack which I've mentioned and as we know his real rating is 1800 I've blundered way earlier with a worse mistake and was thus hopelessly lost.  However I was able to afford to think aggressively as there wasn't an immeidate danger.  Doing this helped me gain confidence which in turn helped me pull a swindle and win in what was a hopelessly lost game.  Note: I do get this idea of boasting from WB so it's not going to stop especially since I've hit my strongest rating.  The idea however is that no matter how bad the sitution not only don't you give up but you don't get nervous or let the Fight or Flight kick in.  Instead you maintain confidence and focus on how to get out of trouble which is also why Jack Stockel is the best coach ever since when I was still having and with little to no help it's something he emphasized and by remembering I've played better and it has helped to succeed in life as well.  So this lesson about confidence and optimisim is something I emphasize to my students.  And the way to remember this which is very important is that in life there are obstacles.  Knowing how to overcome those obstacles is a way to acheive your goals.  That's my model.
369,7,176,9Rf2+,b'8/5k2/8/4K1P1/1p6/8/1P3R2/6r1 b - -',Of course white has a plan.
370,7,177,9Kg7,b'8/6k1/8/4K1P1/1p6/8/1P3R2/6r1 w - -',Better was 95...Kg6 putting pressure right on the pawn and with the R on g1 he gets some counterplay as now white would face a threat.  I know because this is another position that Jack made me study.
371,7,178,9Kd5,b'8/6k1/8/3K2P1/1p6/8/1P3R2/6r1 b - -',Making the K more dangerous and now white has another threat.  It's against the g pawn.  However I would've played 96.Kf5 to prevent black's next move.
372,7,179,9Kc4,b'8/6k1/8/6r1/1pK5/8/1P3R2/8 b - -',But now the threat has increased.  I know what it is.  Right now white's passed pawns are gone but it is even.  However the idea is that if and when he can take white will at once have a passed pawn that can't be stopped which is also another important tactical motif because in order to promote you need an unstoppable passed pawn.
373,7,180,9Rg4+,b'8/6k1/8/8/1pK3r1/8/1P3R2/8 w - -',Obviously.
374,7,181,9Kb5,b'8/6k1/8/1K6/1p4r1/8/1P3R2/8 b - -',Not surprisingly whtie has other ideas and this is the move that I anticipated.
375,7,182,9Kg6,b'8/8/6k1/1K6/1p4r1/8/1P3R2/8 w - -',To strengthen that K.  However I would've stopped the pawn cold with 98...b3 in this position.
376,7,183,9b3,b'8/8/6k1/1K6/1p4r1/1P6/5R2/8 b - -',This is why.
377,7,184,9Rh4,b'8/8/6k1/1K6/1p5r/1P6/5R2/8 w - -',Pointless.  Instead I would've played 99...Kh5 for the reasons outlined earlier but this time black would gain the opposition as he would get the K opposite one another first.
378,7,185,10Ka5,b'8/8/6k1/K7/1p5r/1P6/5R2/8 b - -',Planning to win the pawn.  It is however a compicated tactical motif which most of them are.
379,7,186,10Re4,b'8/8/6k1/K7/1p2r3/1P6/5R2/8 w - -',I don't know why he played this.
380,7,187,10Rf8,b'5R2/8/6k1/K7/1p2r3/1P6/8/8 b - -',I would've played 101.Ra2 with the idea 102.Ra2 and subsequently 103.Rxb4
381,7,188,10Rh4,b'5R2/8/6k1/K7/1p5r/1P6/8/8 w - -',The idea is to be able to bring the K right to the R making it more powerful.  But it's too little too late because of what white does.
382,7,189,10Rb8,b'1R6/8/6k1/K7/1p5r/1P6/8/8 b - -',This is why and it has the same effect that 101.Ra2 would've had as we're about to see. 
383,7,190,10Rh5+,b'1R6/8/6k1/K6r/1p6/1P6/8/8 w - -',Like I said before you might as well place black in check because white was going to win the remaining pawn.  And with it white has an unstoppable passed pawn.  As we know one pawn often makes a difference between a win and loss.  And this game is a perfect example.
384,7,191,Kf7,b'1R6/5k2/8/7r/1K6/1P6/8/8 w - -',I would've played 103...Rh4+ in an attempt to get a draw by repetition.  That K would've moved back a few times.  However I don't think that white would've allowed it anyway because let's say 103...Rh4+ 104.Kc3 Rh3+ 105.Kb4 Rh4+ now white has say 106.Kb5 which would've prevented the draw.  Nontheless however I believe it was worth trying.
385,7,192,10Rc8,b'2R5/5k2/8/7r/1K6/1P6/8/8 b - -',"But now white has a lot of overwhelming advantage and an undisputed passed pawn which will promote.  With it black resigns.  This game emphasizes that one pawn will often make or break a game so they should not be underestimated as pawns are more powerful as they appear.  Remember: In the end there are generally a few pawns left and it shows that it only takes one to do the damage.  That's why ""Don't give things away"" is very important.    "

Black can do two things: c5 and get countergame on the queenside or try to castle queenside instead. Black didn't make the mistake of Nc6 before c5 but castled kingside. This makes it a perfect target for me. It would be exaggerated to say that white has an edge but black has to play with more care that it seems.

First I open up my Bishop to get involved.  I was weary of closing off my light square Bishop from joining the attack but it was already involved by putting pressure on the f7 square.

I didn't go with a special opening I just developed my pieces in a way that be beneficial in the long run.  Had I never developed with my Bishop on c4 the mate wouldn't have been possible since Ne6 would have stopped it.  Sure I capitalized on his errors and had he never taken with his Queen on h4 the game would have gone much differently but I feel like I played a strong game and it gave me a lesson on forming an attack patience and positional play.

RxRf6 would be disastrous for white because QxRa1+ would be followed by QxRf6.  Though black would only pick up 5 points-black has a lot of catching up to do.

In a Sicilian varation this is part of a Grand Prix attack where White can actually consider taking the bishop sacrificing the queen to harass a cramped Black King and using their developed space advantage to do so. This clearly doesn't work here. If f3 I need to worry about Nxe4 for at least the two turns it takes me to get the Queen off the LSB diagonal. If Ne2 I reverse the attack on the queen but delay my ability to defend the e4 pawn all the while it being clear that I cannot castle kingside this match.

I could go back to d2 but that would be a waste of tempo. Going back to h4 did not look  appealing to me after 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 g4! and the pawn on d4 is lost. So taking on f6 seemed to be the only logical option. 
1207,33,6,a3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/1bPP4/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',No need to defend the d4 pawn right away. I figured that this was better to exchange the bishop and still protect d4.

I felt that taking on e5 would give black an advantage since he would have an open e file and make his development easier. So I took a stab at d5 which basically forces the knight to d4 in order to prevent me from playing e4. 
1211,33,10,1Rd1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2Pn4/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/3RKB1R b K -',In retrospect Nxd4 may have been better. I didn't like it because I noticed that after the exchange the pawn on d4 would have been a tough one to get rid of.

My opponent probably believed that I would have good drawing chances so he keeps the queens on the board for now while also threatening an f5 push.

O-O right away then black can strike hard with f4 after which the opening of the f-file becomes serious. With 15. Qd3 I delay a pawn push to f4 because of the pin on the queen and buys me time to castle and lessens the power behind pawn to f4.  
1216,33,15,1Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Ppp2/2P5/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3RK2R w K -',Breaking the pin right away and finalizing the push for f4.

1222,33,21,1a5,b'r4rk1/1ppb2p1/3p1q1p/p2Pp3/1PP2p2/P2Q2P1/4PPBP/3R1RK1 w - a6',Logical move that attempts to weaken my pawn structure. 
1223,33,22,2c5,b'r4rk1/1ppb2p1/3p1q1p/p1PPp3/1P3p2/P2Q2P1/4PPBP/3R1RK1 b - -',If I wanted to play it safe I would have played 20. b5. But I am not interested in playing it safe! I saw an opportunity to push my pawn farther to c6 and open up lines against the king. 
1224,33,23,Ra4,b'5rk1/1ppb2p1/3p1q1p/2PPp3/rP3p2/3Q2P1/4PPBP/3R1RK1 w - -',Attacking the weak pawn right away. At this point I took a great deal of time into my next move as there is much to consider here.

I considered playing c6 right away but then black would get control over the a2-g8 diagonal after 22. c6 bxc6 23. dxc6 Be6. So I played Qb3 to keep control over the diagonal. The only problem is that now black can play Rfa8 which appears quite strong but I was confident that I had things under control. 
1226,33,25,2c6,b'r5k1/1ppb2p1/2Pp1q1p/3Pp3/rP3p2/1Q4P1/4PPBP/3R1RK1 b - -',Now or never I can't just let the doubled rooks wreak havoc after all.

1228,33,27,Qf7,b'r5k1/2p2qp1/2Pp3p/3Qp3/rP3p2/6P1/4PP1P/3R1RK1 w - -',Offering me an exchange which with about 10 minutes remaining on my clock was difficult to decline. 
1229,33,28,2gxf4,b'r7/2p2kp1/2Pp3p/4p3/rP3P2/8/4PP1P/3R1RK1 b - -',Played immediately with the idea of loosening the grip on d4 to allow my rook to post there in defense of the b4 pawn. 
1230,33,29,3Kg2,b'r7/2p2k2/2Pp3p/6p1/rP1R1p2/8/4PPKP/5R2 b - -',Trying to get closer toward the center in order to prevent the king going to e6 and attacking the d4 rook. 
1231,33,30,Rb6,b'8/2p2k2/1rPp3p/6p1/rP1R1p2/8/4PPKP/1R6 w - -',There is too much pressure for me to hold on. Even after my rook goes to c4 the black king can go to e6 and attack c6 as well. 
1232,33,31,3e3,b'8/2p5/1rPpk2p/6p1/rPR2p2/4P3/5PKP/1R6 b - -',Played with the intent of attacking the king with Rd4+ if the king goes to d5. 
1233,33,32,3Rd4+,b'8/2p5/1rPp3p/3k2p1/rP1R4/4P3/6KP/1R6 b - -',This sets a trap. If black plays 35...Kxc6?? 36. b5+! Rxb5 37. Rc1+! and the rook on a4 is lost. 
1234,33,33,3Ke5,b'8/2p5/1rPp3p/4k1p1/rP1R4/4P3/6KP/1R6 w - -',Wisely sidestepping the threat. 
1235,33,34,3Kf3,b'8/2p5/1rPp3p/4k1p1/rP1R4/4PK2/7P/1R6 b - -',At this point my clock was at about 4 minutes while my opponent still had 15. So I rushed this move a little and now my opponent can just take that c6 pawn. 
1236,33,35,3d5,b'8/2p5/1rP4p/3pk1p1/rP1R4/4PK2/7P/1R6 w - -',But surprisingly he doesn't! This move was played most likely to keep my rook off of c4 but it actually gives my rooks a target. 
1237,33,36,3Rbd1,b'8/2p5/1rP4p/3pk1p1/rP1R4/4PK2/7P/3R4 b - -',Attacking the weak d5 pawn basically forcing Rb5. 
1238,33,37,Rab6,b'8/2p5/1rP4p/1r1pk1p1/1P1R4/4PK2/7P/2R5 w - -',But alas in the end it does not matter. Black has done a nice job of defending and now a pawn must finally fall. 
1239,33,38,4Ke2,b'8/2p5/2r4p/1r1pk1p1/1P1R4/4P3/4K2P/3R4 b - -',Eh I honestly can't tell you what I was thinking here. Best was probably h4 to try and exchange as many pawns as I can. This basically asks for black to play Rc2+ which forces an exchange of rooks. 
1240,33,39,4Ra6,b'8/2p5/r6p/1r1pk1p1/1P1R4/4P3/4K2P/3R4 w - -',A very interesting choice. I really can't understand what the motives are behind it. 
1241,33,40,4h4,b'8/2p5/r6p/1r1pk1p1/1P1R3P/4P3/4K3/3R4 b - h3',Jumping on the opportunity to exchange some pawns in order to simplify the position. 
1242,33,41,4Rg4,b'1r6/2p5/8/3pk1p1/1P4R1/3KP3/r7/3R4 b - -',I was filled with hope now. It seemed that the worst was behind me and that maybe I can muster a draw out of this after all.
1243,33,42,Rg8,b'6r1/2p5/8/3p1kp1/1P4R1/r3P3/4K3/6R1 w - -',The only way to defend the pawn but the moves to follow were clear now. 
1244,33,43,4Rd4,b'6r1/2p5/8/3p1kp1/1P1R4/r3P3/4K3/6R1 b - -',So now if black plays either Rd8 or Ke5 to protect d5 I can just get my rook back to g4 and the cycle would repeat. 
1245,33,44,4c6,b'6r1/8/2p5/3p1kp1/1P1R4/r3P3/4K3/6R1 w - -',So black plays the only move that defends the pawn while also not going down the path of repetition. 
1246,33,45,4b5,b'6r1/8/2p5/1P1p1kp1/3R4/r3P3/4K3/6R1 b - -',I played this immediately to force black to give his pawn back. I took a quick glance at the clock at this point and noticed that I had 49 seconds left while my opponent had just under 3 minutes. 
1247,33,46,5Rxb5,b'6r1/8/4k3/1R4p1/8/4PK2/r7/6R1 b - -',I thought to myself that I now have an easy draw as long as I don't do anything stupid. 
1248,33,47,Rf8+,b'5r2/8/4k3/1R4p1/8/4PK2/r7/6R1 w - -',All of these checks were played very quickly by my opponent with the hope that I would collapse under pressure. 
1249,33,48,5Kg4,b'5r2/8/4k3/1R4p1/6K1/4P3/r7/6R1 b - -',This is the start of where things went wrong. Best would have been just to slide back to e4 where the checks would repeat. 
1250,33,49,5Ra4+,b'5r2/8/4k3/1R4p1/r5K1/4P3/8/6R1 w - -',I now realized that I can't play Kxg5?? because of the skewer with Rg8+. Now my king is forced into an uncomfortable position where it will be easy to mess up.  
1251,33,50,5Rg5,b'5r2/8/4k3/6R1/r5p1/4P1K1/8/6R1 b - -',Amazingly this is one of the few moves that loses the game. I now must lose a rook after 59...Rf3+ 60. Kh2 Rh3+ 61. Kg2 Ra2+ 62. Kf1 Rf3+ 63. Ke1 Ra1+. The biggest problem with this move is that it takes away an escape square for the king if I was to play 60. Kh4 after Rf3+. 
1252,33,51,6Kh4,b'8/8/4k3/6R1/r5pK/4Pr2/8/6R1 b - -',It's easy to judge from a spectator's point of view but when the clock is on 15 seconds and counting it is extremely difficult to keep your head straight. 
1253,33,52,6Rh3#,b'8/8/4k3/6R1/r5pK/4P2r/8/6R1 w - -',"All I could do was laugh at myself for not seeing this mate.

As Hartston points out if black takes the queen on d1 white regains the queen with 17.

So instead unlike what isaiah11 (Andrew) once said that the Siclian is more common well this turns out to be the most common response to 1.e4 as I learned from easy19  Yes we are in the King's Pawn Game and I say that because perrinn asked if this was what it was called and I said yes.  That 1.e4 is the King's Pawn Opening and with the move played we're now in the KPG.  In fact before the game we messaged each other because I wanted to know which color he wanted.  The reason I gave him black was to learn more about defenses which is what he told me.  So in the game I said You said you wanted to learn more about defenses which often happens when playing as black. Yes this is the most common move and now you have the King's Pawn Game.

So what I told perrinn is Most common in this position is 2...Nc3 which can lead to interesting variations such as the Ruy Lopez Guaco Piano or Four Knights Opening. So there are more variations but there is nothing wrong this move since it develops a piece and gets you ready to control the center.  Now I could capture and exchange right away.  But instead I do something else.

Therefore I decided to advance my central pawn since it is another developing move.  It get's the other B ready to come up by opening up a line and it brings me one step closer to controlling the center.
1308,35,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',According to the analysis this is an inaccuracy.  Best was to exchange on e4 so that would be 3...Nxe4 and then I'd respond with NXP but I disagree with the analysis because it doesn't lose material.  In fact I like this move better as since it doesn't lose anything black doesn't move the same twice in the opening which presents more opportunities to get the other pieces into play.
1309,35,5,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/4n3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',It was a hard decision between 5.Bc4 and this move.  But the only reason I would even consider playing 5.Bc4 is a cheapo tactic which black would see and I'd be much worse.  So what would be the intention.  Well after 5.Bc4 the idea would be to follow up with 6.Qd5 which as we know mate can be driven off and if he found the right response I might be in trouble.  And as we know and a reminder from what I recently read in an article by GM Susan Polgar cheapo tactics because you must assume that the opponent will find the best move and when he or she does you're in trouble.  So I decided on this move as now there is a lot I can and will do.  In addition there's a very different tactic which I will do.  The idea is to castle and continue development.
1310,35,6,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pP3/4n3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',! Best.  Anything else would lose tempo since that N would have to retreat.

You have to be weary of a N when it's that close to the home square.  So with it I gave perrinn the first HW assignment which as you know you frequently get HW with a mentor as it's part of training.  In fact even a coach will give it but won't announce.  For example the idea with stopping a passed pawn with a R that was HW that Jack indirectly gave me by making me study which I now use to teach.  However I admit that I did so with a small typo.  So I said As with any mentoring session there's generally. So this will be the first question. Of course I didn't have to take. There were other options like pinning the N. However this was the best move in this position. The HW is to answer why this is the best move.  Of course I could tell how difficult it was so I gave it time by saying.  I'll hold off until the question. That is unless time is almost out. But the idea is that it soaks in gradually as that's how you learn. It's about processing information.  So he responded by saying ""Silly me I was not looking at my chat. Er... not usually this stunted...Paying close attention to everything now. I looked up the four nightsruy lopez and guaco piano. Definitely have relied on these for defense. I do have some issue deciding if the knights should move out first or I alternatively will bring center pawns out then bishobs tucked into the 3rd line followed by the knights just above the king and queen. Each of these seems to work but I think 4 knights covers more of the board.""  So my response was It is good that you are seeing them. Ok the solution. If I let the N stay on e4 ...Bxf2+ was being threatened. I would've lost a pawn because I'd be forced to play Kh1 If I took the B with Rxf2 you win the R after ...Bxf2"
1313,35,9,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2n5/2bpP3/4B3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',? I understand why he played this though and it shows that he is thinking ahead which is important.  The idea was to compensate by winning back a pawn this time it would be a central needed for center control.  However he overlooked the N which is protecting the e pawn.  So as I also told him that better was 7...dxe4 because this move loses a pawn.  However I forgot something important this move loses a piece because if he took with 7...dxe4 and I played 8.Qxd8+ he can take back and exchange Q's with 8...Nxd8+ so I'd have a slight edge as I'd be a little ahead in development.  But material would be even.  With my next move however black loses his P and B.  Then I corrected myself by saying BTW after 7.Bxe4 best was 7...dxe4 as it becomes an even exchange even when the Q's are exchanged. But the move after 7...Qe7 lost a piece.  So the idea was that black lost a piece and pawn with this move.
1314,35,10,Bg4,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n5/2bBP3/6b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Deciding to pin the Q.  Actually I like black's intention a lot and this is what I used to do.  However as I recently learned in the consulation game with geniusacamel from I believe ptitroque I believe it was in general you don't want to do that because the opponent will often sac material for a win.  I never saw how but this is what they said.  But this is what I used to play to with the idea being especially after what I mentioned about how dangerous the N's get to pin them.  
1315,35,11,Bxc6+,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2B5/2b1P3/6b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',since 9.Be2 wasn't an option I normally would break it then with 9.h3 and if 9...Bh5 I'd have 10.g4 forcing 10...h5 to prevent him from a losing a piece which btw is a very common continuation that you'll see from GM's.  But this time I wasn't going to do it.  Since I'm ahead I decide to liquidate his N for my B's since the idea is exchange pawns not pieces when you're down.  In fact I said later on Forgot to note that 8...Bg4 appeared good and does develop. But the problem is that it resulted in liquidation which is an exchange when down a piece. So when you are down material exchanging pawns doesn't make a difference but you don't want to exchange pieces though. Doing that gives you less to defend with.
1316,35,12,bxc6,b'r3k2r/p1p1qppp/2p5/2b1P3/6b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"So he said ""ok ill try not to do that""  So my response was yes that is important. In fact although I was at a disadvantage I lost sooner by liquidating one of my pieces when I was down by two pawns.  Then he said ""You know historically my pawns have been under-appreciated. I try by best to move them out of the way so I can execute my assault. I always feel like moving a pawn takes an entire move and the opponent will use that move to strike. I am riveted to see how this goes.""  I actually liked this response because it shows how hard he is thinking studying the board and trying to absorb and process what he's saying.  So I said Opponents do. Yes and I'm glad you brought that up because it's an important concept. They don't attack material for the thrill of it because the opponent will find the best response in which you'd be worse off. There is generally a strategy behind attacking the pawns like winning material getting further in development. So what's important is to ask yourself why the opponent made that move. And then to figure out the reason by using analyze the board. I always emphasize to use that feature because that's where you figure out your opponents plan. It's walking through the process as I call it which is also known as doing HW. Using that and studying the position and the entire board will help you become a better player. In fact a mentor on this site gave me HW questions which is how I learned how important that is. But in order to do that HW I needed to use the Analyze the Board feature to get the answer correct."

Otherwise I wouldn't play it since I don't do things just for thrill of attacking it because there always has to be a plan behind it.  In this case it involves a threat that's very difficult to drive off.  The idea is that on his next move when going after my B and pawns are exchanged the idea is to pin that Q.  However this was not quite as difficult as it appears and was nearly a cheapo tactic.  In fact it is hope chess if you go by Dan Hein's definition since there was something that I overlooked. 
1318,35,14,Be6,b'r3k2r/p1p1q2p/2p1bp2/2b3B1/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',! His LSB.  Therefore I told him that this was best as anything else would've lose his Q since it was pinned.  So in order to prevent getting in trouble since with that definition you can get in trouble now I have to do real chess in a difficult situation to prevent him from getting all of his advantages back.  As we know with WB's Q sac and what Jack Stockel about not underestimating the idea is that just because you have an advantage you can't get overly confident.  You still have to calculate and plan ahead or you could wind up in trouble.  So I have to think and display real chess to.
1319,35,15,1Qe2,b'r3k2r/p1p1q2p/2p1bp2/2b3B1/8/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',The best way is to think like a GM.  And I say that because typically the GM's will often bring their Q in front of the R.  I never understood why until recently.  In fact this is the game where I was finally able to apply the concept from GM Judit Polgar in her game against Anand.  The idea is that you're adding a defender.  So now black can take my B but then I would take back and would pin that Q by liquidation.
1320,35,16,1Bd6,b'r3k2r/p1p1q2p/2pbbp2/6B1/8/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2R1K1 w kq -',"At this point he said ""I have a bunch of unused analyze the game features so if you find one of our games worth keeping let me know I think i see your attack forming so I am moving my rooks in to the center and changing as much as possible in the time I have so your attack will have to adjust to the moves.""  Maybe but first always expect your opponents to find the best moves.  Though this was good for the same reasons that he was thinking about adjusting but your opponents plans are just as important as your own so one needs to be weary of what the opponent will do.  The idea is expecting him or her to find the best moves and not assume anything.  Now I wasn't going to say anything because no matter what black played I was still going to take his LSB even if he took my DSB but this moral in general however is very important and can make a big difference in his or her games.  But this move however loses a piece.  Best here was 13...fxg5 and after 14.Qxe6 although it's liquidation it's still an even exchange as there was no other way to avoid the loss of another piece.   "

But @perrinn: This time I was wrong none of them would've helped or prevented the loss of another piece.  I was thinking of a position later on and kind of got mixed up where I was which happens a little more often the it appears.  So best was what I noted a move earlier that is 13...fxg5

That is generally a good idea when behind and I remember playing like this.  And it is good to be aggressive but in situations like this one must think defensively as opposed to offensively.  That B should've remained or if he played ...c5 earlier this move would've been safe.  But the problem is that now I will play my next move as if black had played the Domino Defense and took the N but in a much worse concept.  And that's because move loses another P and his Q for a R because after I take his pawn that Q is directly pinned by my R.  Now I actually applied this concept from the Domino plus my last game with jstevens1 and one from ubermensch43 where they won by getting that pin on my Q.  But I am very glad that perrinn does not resign so he does have the right approach.  The idea is ""Fight til the End"" as mentioned in my last annotation."

So I am going to keep what I have won unless I have a reason for giving something away.  Actually in this position I remembered the mistake I made against superandy where I was up material but wasn't careful and lost my Q.  Despite that swindle it's generally not a good idea to make that mistake against someone that you're training as the idea becomes getting a second chance which is not a good moral as I learned from the realjimfriar in the WTWLTR club.
1324,35,20,1Rad8,b'3r3r/p1p1bk1p/2Q2p2/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN4K1 w - -',At this point perrinn smiled.  But I know why and in the past I used to miss this threat.  But he is threatening a Back Rank mate which would be the reason to give away that pawn.  In other words the idea was letting me have that pawn and if I took he would mate.  But after the mistake that Jack made by taking my pawn after I was lost with a R+2 pawns down and 2 passed pawns one which nearly promoted like that game with archduke_piccolo but then losing right away by taking another pawn I was not going to make that mistake.  So I told him that I see and know his intentions but I don't have to allow mate because as noted the idea is expecting your opponent to find the best move.  Now there are ways that I can get out of it with good moves like opening up.  But this time and I going by what I read from GM Susan Polgar outlined as opposed to what Isaiah had to say or anything else but have known for a while and always teach my students anyway when you see a good move look for something better.
1325,35,21,1Nc3,b'3r3r/p1p1bk1p/2Q2p2/8/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',So I prevent mate with this move.  And the reason I played this as opposed to opening up is that this move completes development.

Now do you remember where I quizzed him about moving the K and inadvertently gave him the HW for move 13.  Well it was actually meant for this move and better was 19...Kg7 or 19...Kf8 as this move loses a R.  I actually told him that those two were better moves.
1329,35,25,Bf8,b'3rkbQ1/p1p4p/5p2/8/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',? The idea was to intercete a piece rather then move the K in an uncomfortable.  And Jack has told me that in general you want to intercede pieces to get out of check rather then move the K where it would be exposed but the K should've moves and the reason being is that his c pawn was still hanging.  So this move loses another pawn.  The only other move was 20...Kd7 and that would've been better as there would be another defender to c7.  Therefore this loses a pawn.
1330,35,26,Ke7,b'3r1bQ1/p1B1k2p/5p2/8/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Not completely sure why he played but unfortunately I hate to say this but there aren't any good moves for black at this point.  So he is doing what he can and staying in until the end.  Now most people would get angry and say that he should resign.  But I disagree with that.  In fact his attitude is very good and I'm glad he is playing on.  @perrinn: Doing what you are here in general believe it or not might allow you to pull swindles win or draw lost positions should the opponent make a mistake.  And by staying in you are learning more.
1331,35,27,2Bxd8+,b'3B1bQ1/p3k2p/5p2/8/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Meanwhile I waste no time in grabbing his other R.  Now in the past I would miss this opportunity paradoxically.  But that is where I went wrong in my epic and historic game against Jack where I was way ahead and had even won a Q for his R like I did here.  And towards the end but not as much ahead this was the exchange well not exactly in the same situation but the kind of exchange I missed that is R for B where I could've grabbed his R.  By doing that he was able to gain all of his advantages and pull a swindle against me where he won with passed pawn.  The reason why that was epic was that's where I discovered how important chess is in life that you must think and plan ahead.  The idea is that when liquidating you are planning ahead because it's about how to keep your advantages and do further damages until you have an overwhelming advantage.  So this time unlike that game I was not going to make the same mistake so I took.
1332,35,28,2Ke8,b'3BkbQ1/p6p/5p2/8/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',?? I think the idea was getting the K back to it's comfortable square.  But best was 22...Kxd8 yes he'd still lose a R for B but with this move that R is free.  
1333,35,29,2Rd1,b'3BkbQ1/p6p/5p2/8/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',So this is how I protect and the idea is that instead of retreating I will put pressure right on his K.  I have studied a bit of GM games and what I see most of them when a position like this happens and you have an advantage instead of moving the attacked piece they put pressure right on the attacker.  From that I figured out that it is in general the quickest way to win.  I know because I analyzed this move and it does more then just protect.  With that pressure on the K I now have a mate in 3 no matter what black does this time.  And that's because his K is and DSB are pinned.  Well technically the K isn't pinned but the reason I say so what I allude is by the general definition of a pin since that the K can't move and in order to avoid mate it would have to do so.  And were the B not pinned he would be able to prevent an immediate mate with 23...Be7 but since both are pinned there's no way out.
1334,35,30,2h5,b'3BkbQ1/p7/5p2/7p/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - h6',"Might as well protect the pawn.  It's like with Jack when I had and did mate him no matter what.  So he took a piece but he said ""I might as well since I can't do anything anyway.""  And I still like his willingness to continue and his effort."
1335,35,31,2Qxe7#,b'3Bk3/p3Q3/5p2/7p/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Overall perrinn played extremely well.  In fact about 150 points north of his rating so like an 1100 rated player.  But the morals as I told him are to expect that your opponent will find the best move and not make any assumptions ask yourself if there is a threat like checkmate or lost of material and how by doing HW with Analyze the Board which btw is why teachers will often give those HW assignments because it's good practice.  In addition this is also the reason that why is the most common chess question.  It's about theory because that's where you analyze what move works or doesn't and why such as what I noted about the threats.  To look at everything and study the position very carefully the same way as you evaluate the threats so part of the same thing.  When you find a good move look for something better.  Also when evaluating and you have plans remembering that your opponents plans are just as important as your own.  Last but not least when you have an opportunity like getting a piece back as it was with the B early take advantage of it while it's around.  That's because opportunites don't last that long and if you don't take advantage early you might wind up in trouble.  @perrinn: You're rating will improve before you know it but if you can remember these morals I think your rating will reach 1100 in about 6 months.

Neither of these happened. Looking back I'm not sure what I should have done differently here. B on d1 was trapped in by the P on c3 and the N on f3. Be2 would have at least started a different line eventually leading to what though Bd3? Bc4? This is the part of the game I have the most trouble with.
1360,37,7,Be3,b'rnb2rk1/ppp2pp1/7p/8/4Np2/2P1b3/PPP3PP/R1BB1R1K w - -',I did not expect this. Looking back it was setup perfectly for after 12. Ne4 to do this and I should have seen that. Had I just done 12. Nf4 would he have gone back to d6? I doubt it looking at this position even Nf4 would have allowed Be3 and retreat was not something my opponent ultimately needed to do in this game. With the enemy in the midst of my ranks I couldn't let it stand. So I exchanged and hoped to be able to hide the pawn under my knight so I could remove it as well.
