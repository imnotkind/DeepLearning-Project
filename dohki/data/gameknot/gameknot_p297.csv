88,4,2,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The old mainline. The new mainline is Nd7 with Ngf6. Both are playable. Black wants to get his light bishop out before e6 (an advantage of 1...c6 over 1...e6) which would shut it in for quite some time.
89,4,3,Ng3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',In turn White tries to harrass this bishop while developing his pieces into agressive squares.

91,4,5,Nf4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p1bp/8/3P1N1P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Putting the knight into a nice square with threat to the Bishop.

93,4,7,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppb/2p1p2p/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Standard exchange. The point is that Black has been using all his turns to develop his light bishop and now has been forced to trade it off for a piece that only moved once. He would be down a lot of tempos straight from the opening. But Black's position is solid enough that if he doesn't commit any major errors he should be OK.
94,4,8,Bd6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppb/2pbp2p/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',A bit forceful. The objective for Black in this opening is not to attack White (if he wants to be agressive then Sicillian would have been a better choice) but to keep the balance using his solid position. Developing with Nf6 first would have been preferred I think.
95,4,9,1Nfh5,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppb/2pbp2p/7N/3P3P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White has already had most of his pieces out and ready for attack. This move highlights the error of Bd6. Black's kingside is exposed to weakness that cannot be covered by 0-0. If his bishop hasn't moved then Nh5 would not generate any serious threat.
96,4,10,1g6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3p1b/2pbp1pp/7N/3P3P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Awkward move. The light bishop is shut in. But it's hard to come up with an alternative since Black had wasted too many turns with ineffectual moves. Black has been too trusting in his solid position that he completely forgot the fundamental rule of opening: developing your pieces.
97,4,11,1Nf4,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',No speculative sacrifice to be found. But often time creating a weakness in your opponent's camp is as good an objective as any.

While their enemies are ready in formation preparing for battle they have to stay home in their original squares looking pretty.

101,4,15,1Nfe2,b'r3k1nr/ppqn1p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P3P/3B1QN1/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',There's really not much White can do at the moment despite his superior development. Black's position is still rather solid. I saw that if Black was to push e5 the next move then I would be forced to trade my d4 pawn for it and then Black knight can go to e5 attacking my Queen. His position wouldn't seem as bad then. So I decided to retreat and see what Black's plan is.

This is the first commital move of the game since d4 is slightly weakened but only if Black manages to gain some counterattack via c5 or e5. Note that I haven't settled down on castling yet give me the option of castle kingside and go for opposite side attack which would benefit me since my pieces are more ready.
106,4,20,1Bxg3,b'2kr2nr/ppq2p1b/2p1pnpp/8/2PP3P/3B1Qb1/PP1BNPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',I did not see this move coming partly because I did not expect Black to part his bishop for a knight. The position is rather open and my bishop pair might become an advantage.

White attempts to stake a further claim to the pivotal d5 square while ignoring the fact that neither of his developed pieces are defended.  This isn't a preferable second move as most continuations follow 2. Nf3 developing the Knight to a natural square and still claiming a part of the centre.
122,5,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',A move with a double purpose.  2...e6 both defends the weak f7 and threatens 3...d5 an encounter that will leave Black a bishop up and much more developed.

In most Sicilian games the d4 is played much earlier on (with the Queen still on the d-file) in order to destablise Black's pawn structure.

The early Bc4 essentially leaves White a piece and several tempos down from the opening which allows Black to establish a strong discovered attack and gain another piece advantage.  Finally the errant pawn of the original defensive chain proves to be the key piece of the game by both keeping White's Rook out of play and by continually threatening promotion and check.

Probably my favourite chess trap although it's very easy for an experienced player to spot and avoid.  I certainly wouldn't recommend using it...ever...because there are several chances for White to decline escape and capitalise on the early sacrifice of Black's material and position.  But a fun party piece all the same.

This game is a textbook example of the trap with a few of the possible escapes outlined. Enjoy!"
166,7,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',A standard Italian Game up until now; this is the point at which Black must decide whether he is actually going to use the Blackburne or go for something a lot more main line: 3...Bc5 (Giuoco Piano although I'm not a fan) or Nf6 (Two Knights defence) for example.
167,7,2,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"Nd4?!  The gambit.  Here Black intentionally gives up defence of the e5 pawn in order to tempt a gain of material in 4. Nxe5 and potentially allow White the easy fork with 5. Nxf7.  

This is one of the most obvious opportunities for White to sidestep the trap with 4. Nxd4 which essentially leaves Black underdeveloped with a hanging pawn on d4 and his weak f7 still under threat.  Alternative moves include simply ignoring the Knight and continuing with White's own development or reinforcing the bishop and undefended pawn with 4. d3."
168,7,3,Nxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"4. Nxe5?  White falls into the trap -- on first glance this appears to be a move capitalising on Black's ""blunder"".  There is no easy way for Black to gain a pawn back at this point and White seems set for the fork between Rook and Queen on the next move."
169,7,4,Qg5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N1q1/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"4...Qg5!  It is never wise to bring out the Queen so early in the game but the reason for the pawn sacrifice becomes clear: to persuade the Knight into giving up protection of g5 and h4.  Black now threatens both the unprotected Knight and the undefended g2 square.  Assuming White only notices the first threat he will continue his plans for the fork with 5. Nxf7.

The obvious escape at this juncture is simply for White to castle;  the g2 square is then protected and White can force the Queen to retreat with 6. d3 or f4.  Another playable counter is 5. Nd4 which both blocks the Queen's threat to g2 and prevents 5...Qxe5 which would be the result of White castling losing him the Knight and allowing Black to strengthen his position.  "

A very good move at first glance but this will essentially bring about White's downfall: even though he has forced a fork between Queen and Rook (defended by Bc4) it is unlikely the Knight will get a chance to move again following...
171,7,6,Qxg2,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PqP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',5...Qxg2!!  A highly aggressive attack on White's kingside.  The placement of the d-file Knight is now revealed as very significant as it blocks the King's only escape.  White is practically forced to play 6. Rf1 as playing Rg1 or leaving the rook where it is will result in a back rank mate.
172,7,7,Rf1,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PqP/RNBQKR2 b Qkq -',Forced.

This is essentially White's final opportunity to escape the Blackburne Shilling trap:  if he plays 7. Be2 he smothers his own King and is mated in one;  if he plays Qe2 sacrificing his Queen (which some players seem reluctant to do even in the face of imminent checkmate!) it prolongs his game somewhat but he is still left in a terrible position and down by a significant amount."
174,7,9,Be2,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/3nq3/8/PPPPBP1P/RNBQKR2 b Qkq -',7. Be2??  Not wanting to lose his Queen White blocks the check with his bishop.  But the King is now fully surrounded by his own pieces and the coup de grace comes in the form of...
175,7,10,Nf3#,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/4q3/5n2/PPPPBP1P/RNBQKR2 w Qkq -',"7...Nf3!!#  A smothered mate.  White's bishop cannot take the Knight without exposing the King to a second check and so drowning in his own pieces White is finished.

As I said at the start there are a number of ways to avoid this trap (for beginners and inexperienced players -- experienced players would hopefully spot this one a distance away).  In any case I use this one more for humour than anything else; you feel a little guilty just using it!"

184,8,8,e6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Also playable is Bg4 but in all variations dxc5 is good for white. e6 while blocking that bishop in lets the dark bishop develop. Also black's light bishop can develop on b7 controlling a powerful diagonal.
185,8,9,Bd3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Developing the bishop to target black's kingside. Also playable is the idea of Be2 and Na3. 
186,8,10,Be7,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Preparing to castle quickly.

188,8,12,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',same idea that white has.
189,8,13,Be3,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PBBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',The way black played is annoying b/c I lost a tempo. usually people will play cxd4 early and my dark bishop will go to g5 immediately. At this tourney I didn't consider the Be2 and Na3 variations.
190,8,14,cxd4,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3q4/3p4/2PBBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',This defends against the tactic dxc5 bxc5 Bxh7  Kxh7 Qxd5 Nxd5 Bxc5 which would win a pawn.
191,8,15,cxd4,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3q4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',This makes room for Nc3. The isolated d-pawn is double edged because it is an endgame weakness in most cases but in the middle game it controls key squares like c5 and e5.
192,8,16,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Nc6 develops his knight on a centre-controlling square. He is eying my isolated d-pawn now.
193,8,17,1Nc3,b'r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Attacks the queen and develops with a tempo.
194,8,18,1Qd8,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/3P4/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Gets the queen out of the attack. Personally I prefer Qd6 in this position.
195,8,19,1a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',a3 prevents the idea black has of playing Nb4 and then Nbd5 which would be a strong post and an equalized position. a3 is the only chance for an advantage.
196,8,20,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This move is dubious. He wants to play b5 but b5 doesn't control very much in these positions. I made this move look silly. In this position b6 was much better.
197,8,21,1Rc1,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Rc1! now b5 is impossible b/c of Nxb5 which wins a pawn. I develop this Rook and make room for the idea of Bb1 and Qd3.
198,8,22,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/ppn1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',he realized a6 was a waste move but still needs to develop his bishop on b7.
199,8,23,1Bb1,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/ppn1pn2/8/3P4/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/1BRQ1RK1 b - -',this move prepares Qd3 which launches an attack on the kingside. 
200,8,24,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/ppn1pn2/8/3P4/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/1BRQ1RK1 w - -',Develops the bishop on a strong diagonal.
201,8,25,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/ppn1pn2/8/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 b - -',I think this is a fundamental attacking move. Attacking players love this. I can play Bg5 attacking the knight which defends h7 and later on I have ideas like h4 also.
202,8,26,1b5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',now that the tactic is defended of Nxb5 he can play the oh so (not) important b5.
203,8,27,1Ne4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3PN3/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 b - -',Tactically attacking. I'm threatening Nxf6  and if Nxe4 Qxe4 then I'm forking h7 and c6.
204,8,28,1g6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bp1p/p1n1pnp1/1p6/3PN3/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',This is the only move that defends the tactic.
205,8,29,1Nc5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bp1p/p1n1pnp1/1pN5/3P4/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 b - -',Nc5!? This move is interesting. I want him to play Bxc5 dxc5 so I will have a passed pawn and a beautiful bishop pair. I'm threatening b7 also.
206,8,30,1Na5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bp1p/p3pnp1/npN5/3P4/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',He didn't want to play Bc8 which is horrid. This move is the best try for black.
207,8,31,1Nxb7,b'r2q1rk1/1N2bp1p/p3pnp1/np6/3P4/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 b - -',Getting rid of his bishop so now I have the advantage of 2 bishops against a B N. In open positions like this chess theory dictates that 2 bishops have an advantage.
208,8,32,1Nxb7,b'r2q1rk1/1n2bp1p/p3pnp1/1p6/3P4/P2QBN2/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',Duh. recaptures.

210,8,34,1Qd5,b'r4rk1/1n2bp1p/p3pnp1/1p1qN3/3P4/P2QB3/1P3PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',Avoids the fork and prepares to bring the rooks to the centre files.

214,8,38,2Nc5,b'2r2rk1/4bp1p/p3pnp1/1pnqN1B1/3P4/P7/1P1Q1PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',A tactically developing move. He saw the danger of Qf4 and brought his knight to the centre.

217,8,41,2Bf4,b'2r2rk1/4bp1p/p3pnp1/1pP1q3/5B2/P7/1P1Q1PPP/1BR2RK1 b - -',Now that the knight is gone then there is no more threat of Nc6 so the knight is secure on f6 now. So Bf4 shifts to another diagonal. I only had about 30 minutes in this position. After I play b4 black will have no way of making progress.
218,8,42,2Qd5,b'2r2rk1/4bp1p/p3pnp1/1pPq4/5B2/P7/1P1Q1PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',Gets the Queen out of the way.

222,8,46,2Nd5,b'2r2rk1/4bp1p/p3p1p1/1pPn4/1P6/P7/3B1PPP/1BR2RK1 w - -',develops the knight in the centre and prepares to put his bishop on f6 which would control an awesome diagonal.
223,8,47,2Be4,b'2r2rk1/4bp1p/p3p1p1/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/3B1PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Puts the Bishop in the center and attacking the centralized knight. If he recaptures with the e pawn then my position will be winning.
224,8,48,2Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/4bp1p/p3p1p1/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/3B1PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Defends the knight so the e-pawn doesn't have to recapture.
225,8,49,2Rc2,b'2rr2k1/4bp1p/p3p1p1/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/2RB1PPP/5RK1 b - -', I only had 10 minutes in this position and I wanted to make time control at 40 moves. I was afraid of Bf6 Bb2. And if I played Rfd1 Bf6 Rc2 then I was scared of Nc3! which wouldve won.

227,8,51,2Rb1,b'2rr2k1/5p1p/p3pbp1/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/2RB1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',It has the hidden idea of g3 followed by Bg2 Bf1 and a4.

230,8,54,2Kf1,b'3r2k1/5p1p/p1r1pbp1/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/2RB1PPP/2R2K2 b - -',Another quick move this move has the purpose of bringing my king to the center. In the endgame the king is an attacking piece worth almost as much as a rook.
231,8,55,3Rd1,b'3r4/5pk1/p1r1pbpp/1pPn4/1P2B3/P7/2RBKPPP/3R4 b - -',Black has nothing here. He is making pointless moves but he has nothing he can do to make progress.
232,8,56,3g3,b'3r4/2r2pk1/p3pbpp/1pPn4/1P2B3/P5P1/2RBKP1P/3R4 b - -',This move has the idea of Bf4 also the idea of dropping the bishop back to g2 if I have to.

283,8,107,5Rxh2,b'8/P4pk1/1K6/6p1/1P6/8/7r/8 w - -',He took it. He thought this was the only chance here b/c he has a R  2 passed pawns against my queen   pawn.
284,8,108,5a8=Q,b'Q7/5pk1/1K6/6p1/1P6/8/7r/8 b - -',Forced.
285,8,109,5Kg6,b'Q7/5p2/1K4k1/6p1/1P6/8/7r/8 w - -',This position is resignable on my analysis but if I was a total fish then I might let him get his 2 pawns to the end of the board.
286,8,110,5Qe4+,b'8/5p2/1K4k1/6p1/1P2Q3/8/7r/8 b - -',Qe4 ! if he plays Kg7 then I have Qe5  winning the rook. He loses the rook by force here. If Kh5 then Qh7!. 
287,8,111,5f5,b'8/8/1K4k1/5pp1/1P2Q3/8/7r/8 w - f6',Hoping to save his rook.
288,8,112,6Qe8+,b'4Q3/8/1K4k1/5pp1/1P6/8/7r/8 b - -',He loses his rook for sure. If Kh6 Qh8  or if Kg7 Qe5 . if Kh7 then I have Qd7  Kg8 (Kg6 Qd6 ) Qc8  Kg7 Qc7 . If he plays Kf6 hen I have Qc6  followed by Qc7 . This game proves that a carefully calculated endgame can lead to a brilliant win.
289,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is an interesting game of attrition where there were ebs and flows with the momentum shifting one way then the other before the game came to its natural conclusion. For much of the end-game it looked like a draw when Black made a critical mistake that decided the game.
290,9,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',the opening was fairly typical with each of us jockying for control of the board as the opening developed
291,9,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I offered the Queens pawn in an exchange
292,9,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',but the offer was declined forcing me to defend the Kings pawn
293,9,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This presented black with a  chance to pin the Knight against the King
294,9,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',which he did! 
295,9,6,a3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1PP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',so I hit back but
296,9,7,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',black forced the exchange which is fine with me since I like my Bishops for later in the game and don't mind surrendering a Knight for a Bishop exchange
297,9,8,bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The problem this presents for me is the double pawn in the C rank
298,9,9,exd4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3pP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But black gave me an immediate opportunity to solve that problem
299,9,10,Qxd4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',But I decline the offer choosing instead to bring my Queen into the game. 
300,9,11,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',causing black to resort to Castling a good defensive manouver under the circumstances
301,9,12,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQ -',but it allows me to advance my Pawn into black territory and threaten the Knight
302,9,13,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',Moving the Castle to the open rank is a good move and I am prevented from capturing his Knight by the check that would result. 
303,9,14,Nf3,b'rnbqr1k1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',So I continue my development toward Castling
304,9,15,d6,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',this presents a situation where a Queen exchange might be in the offing
305,9,16,Bf4,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/3Q1B2/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',But I am also able to advance my development by bringing my black Bishop into the game
306,9,17,dxe5,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/3Q1B2/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',allowing this Pawn attack.
307,9,18,1Nxe5,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/4N3/3Q1B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',But a pawn will never overcome a well positioned Queen protected by her Knight! And still the Queen exchange looms
308,9,19,1Nc6,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/3Q1B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',The game is starting to open up now and this Knight attack returns balance to the board even though I think I still have the advantage by being on the front foot and challenging more of the black side of the board. 
309,9,20,1Qxd8,b'r1bQr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/5B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Believing that I have the tactical advantage I push forward and exchange Queens
310,9,21,1Rxd8,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/5B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',This position increases black strength though with the Castle controlling the center rank
311,9,22,1g3,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/5B2/P1P3P1/2P2P1P/R3KB1R b KQ -',So I get ready to castle
312,9,23,1Ne4,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/4nB2/P1P3P1/2P2P1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',Seeing the potential of my retreat the black Knight comes riding in to cut me off
313,9,24,1c4,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/2P1nB2/P5P1/2P2P1P/R3KB1R b KQ -',I protect my vulnerable Pawn
314,9,25,1Nc3,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/2P2B2/P1n3P1/2P2P1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',and the Knight jumps in to give the Castle cover in a planned long range attack
315,9,26,1Bd3,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/2P2B2/P1nB2P1/2P2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',So I protect the king with my Bishop preventing the Castle from advancing too far and still allowing me to castle
316,9,27,1Bh3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/2P2B2/P1nB2Pb/2P2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',With this move my King is penned in and can pretty much only move freely on the e rank. Should black be able to threaten me on the e rank I am in trouble
317,9,28,1a4,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/P1P2B2/2nB2Pb/2P2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',So with an attack is arriving in the middle of the board I attack on the flank to draw the army away
318,9,29,1Nb4,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/PnP2B2/2nB2Pb/2P2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',I am not sure I have achieved my desired result and with this move my bishop is under double threat
319,9,30,1Ra3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/PnP2B2/R1nB2Pb/2P2P1P/4K2R b K -',I continue to press on the flank to keep black's attention away from my threatened King
320,9,31,1Nba2,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P2B2/R1nB2Pb/n1P2P1P/4K2R w K -',By moving thus the knights are pinned themselves unless they can escape by threatening another piece
321,9,32,1Kd2,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P2B2/R1nB2Pb/n1PK1P1P/7R b - -',I take the opportunity to move my King into the attack
322,9,33,1Ne4+,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P1nB2/R2B2Pb/n1PK1P1P/7R w - -',unfortunately giving his Knight just the opportunity I describe where  check prevents me from capturing the now abandoned Knight
323,9,34,1Ke3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P1nB2/R2BK1Pb/n1P2P1P/7R b - -',So I press on with the King forcing the attack. This is unusual for me but without Queens on the board and with his black Bishop captured the King has more freedom over the board during the middle game
324,9,35,1Nac3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P1nB2/R1nBK1Pb/2P2P1P/7R w - -',Again the Knights protect each other once again. But the board has changed in character now and although black has several minor pieces in my half of the board I am still in good position and neither player is seriously at a disadvantage. 
325,9,36,1f3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/P1P1nB2/R1nBKPPb/2P4P/7R b - -',But a Knight guarded by a Knight is no match for a free Pawn with capture on his mind
326,9,37,1Nc5,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/2n1N3/P1P2B2/R1nBKPPb/2P4P/7R w - -',And by running away black has chosen which Knight to sacrifice 
327,9,38,2Rxc3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/2n1N3/P1P2B2/2RBKPPb/2P4P/7R b - -',which my castle captures dutifully putting me ahead with several points for a time. 
328,9,39,2Nxa4,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/n1P2B2/2RBKPPb/2P4P/7R w - -',with this move the deficit is reduced and my Castle is threatened.
329,9,40,2Rb3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/n1P2B2/1R1BKPPb/2P4P/7R b - -',so I position my Castle to capture the knight should he move it toward my King
330,9,41,2Nc5,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/2n1N3/2P2B2/1R1BKPPb/2P4P/7R w - -',but he runs away allowing me to consolidate my position
331,9,42,2Rb5,b'r2r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/1Rn1N3/2P2B2/3BKPPb/2P4P/7R b - -',so I force the issue
332,9,43,2b6,b'r2r2k1/p1p2ppp/1p6/1Rn1N3/2P2B2/3BKPPb/2P4P/7R w - -',Foiled!
333,9,44,2Bf1,b'r2r2k1/p1p2ppp/1p6/1Rn1N3/2P2B2/4KPPb/2P4P/5B1R b - -',So I threaten the Bishop to force his retreat...
334,9,45,2a6,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/pp6/1Rn1N3/2P2B2/4KPPb/2P4P/5B1R w - -',But black challenges my Castle instead forcing me to retreat
335,9,46,2Rb1,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/pp6/2n1N3/2P2B2/4KPPb/2P4P/1R3B1R b - -',which I do
336,9,47,2Bf5,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/pp6/2n1Nb2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/1R3B1R w - -',and then so does he but he puts my pawn in danger by pinning him against my Castle
337,9,48,2Rc1,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/pp6/2n1Nb2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R b - -',so I cover him and remove the danger for the time being
338,9,49,2Ne6,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/pp2n3/4Nb2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R w - -',Black retreats to regroup for his next attack
339,9,50,2Nc6,b'r2r2k1/2p2ppp/ppN1n3/5b2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R b - -',so I threaten the Castle with an obvious move
340,9,51,2Rde8,b'r3r1k1/2p2ppp/ppN1n3/5b2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R w - -',Which forces the Castle off the open rank
341,9,52,2Ne5,b'r3r1k1/2p2ppp/pp2n3/4Nb2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R b - -',So I retreat - job done - to protect the open Pawn
342,9,53,2f6,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp2np2/4Nb2/2P2B2/4KPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R w - -',Inviting the Pawn attack
343,9,54,2Nd3,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp2np2/5b2/2P2B2/3NKPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R b - -',causing me to take up a more defensive posture. I am clearly under pressure and on the back foot now with my Bishop threatened by the Knight and a revealed check
344,9,55,2Nc5+,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/2n2b2/2P2B2/3NKPP1/2P4P/2R2B1R w - -',Instead the Knight threatens my Knight leaving me in check from the Castle so 
345,9,56,2Kf2,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/2n2b2/2P2B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/2R2B1R b - -',I retreat
346,9,57,2Ne6,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp2np2/5b2/2P2B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/2R2B1R w - -',and the Knight retreats avoiding the exchange. I remain 2 points ahead after the skirmish
347,9,58,3Re1,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp2np2/5b2/2P2B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/4RB1R b - -',I use the opportunity cover the open rank essentially pinning the Knight against the Castle
348,9,59,3Nd4,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/5b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/4RB1R w - -',The Knight moves down opening the Castle exchange which
349,9,60,3Rxe8+,b'r3R1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/5b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/5B1R b - -',I take advantage of...Hey I have a two point lead!
350,9,61,3Rxe8,b'4r1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/5b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2K1P/5B1R w - -',the exchange complete I have to regroup...so I
351,9,62,3Bg2,b'4r1k1/2p3pp/pp3p2/5b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2KBP/7R b - -',Open up my Castle so that the first row is protected by him as I anticipate the coming attack. 
352,9,63,3c5,b'4r1k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2KBP/7R w - c6',Black pushes his pawns to protect the Knight
353,9,64,3Re1,b'4r1k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2KBP/4R3 b - -',I invite another Castle exchange
354,9,65,3Rxe1,b'6k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P2KBP/4r3 w - -',Which black accepts 
355,9,66,3Kxe1,b'6k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/2P3BP/4K3 b - -',I use my King to take the Castle rather than my Knight to protect a Pawn but do not realize the danger I put myself in as a result
356,9,67,3Nxc2+,b'6k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2P2B2/3N1PP1/2n3BP/4K3 w - -',The Knight check captures a pawn. So I lose a Pawn and the game is closer after the mistake
357,9,68,3Kd2,b'6k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2P2B2/3N1PP1/2nK2BP/8 b - -',So with my Pawn gone I have to protect my Knight. I am still playing on the back foot. 
358,9,69,3Nd4,b'6k1/6pp/pp3p2/2p2b2/2Pn1B2/3N1PP1/3K2BP/8 w - -',Black retreats
359,9,70,3Bd6,b'6k1/6pp/pp1B1p2/2p2b2/2Pn4/3N1PP1/3K2BP/8 b - -',I advance
360,9,71,3Nb3+,b'6k1/6pp/pp1B1p2/2p2b2/2P5/1n1N1PP1/3K2BP/8 w - -',Black continues to attack my King. This check presents no significant danger for me. 
361,9,72,3Kc3,b'6k1/6pp/pp1B1p2/2p2b2/2P5/1nKN1PP1/6BP/8 b - -',By responding with my King I force the knight to move away to survive and fight another day. 
362,9,73,3Nd4,b'6k1/6pp/pp1B1p2/2p2b2/2Pn4/2KN1PP1/6BP/8 w - -',Which the Knight does moving to a position where a check will follow. 
363,9,74,3f4,b'6k1/6pp/pp1B1p2/2p2b2/2Pn1P2/2KN2P1/6BP/8 b - -',I decide to develop my Pawn structure
364,9,75,3a5,b'6k1/6pp/1p1B1p2/p1p2b2/2Pn1P2/2KN2P1/6BP/8 w - -',Black follows suit
365,9,76,3Bd5+,b'6k1/6pp/1p1B1p2/p1pB1b2/2Pn1P2/2KN2P1/7P/8 b - -',I see an interesting opening that I take with a check
366,9,77,3Be6,b'6k1/6pp/1p1Bbp2/p1pB4/2Pn1P2/2KN2P1/7P/8 w - -',Black defends inviting the Bishop exchange. 
367,9,78,4Bxe6+,b'6k1/6pp/1p1BBp2/p1p5/2Pn1P2/2KN2P1/7P/8 b - -',which I accept in part because it forces the Knight to retreat.
368,9,79,4Nxe6,b'6k1/6pp/1p1Bnp2/p1p5/2P2P2/2KN2P1/7P/8 w - -',I am one point ahead and if we exchange all our pieces assuming I don't make too many mistakes I should be in position to win
369,9,80,4f5,b'6k1/6pp/1p1Bnp2/p1p2P2/2P5/2KN2P1/7P/8 b - -',SO I press ahead with my pawn to try to prevent the King from escaping. 
370,9,81,4Nd4,b'6k1/6pp/1p1B1p2/p1p2P2/2Pn4/2KN2P1/7P/8 w - -',"I have to find a way to capture the Knight
"
371,9,82,4g4,b'6k1/6pp/1p1B1p2/p1p2P2/2Pn2P1/2KN4/7P/8 b - -',but I advance my pawns
372,9,83,4b5,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppp2P2/2Pn2P1/2KN4/7P/8 w - -',Black does the same. This is an interesting position where a Pawn exchange will result in check unless I can capture the unprotected pawn first...
373,9,84,4Nxc5,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2Pn2P1/2K5/7P/8 b - -',thus allowing me to potentially capture two pawns at once. 
374,9,85,4Ne2+,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2P3P1/2K5/4n2P/8 w - -',Black forces check and positions himself to capture my pawns
375,9,86,4Kd3,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2P3P1/3K4/4n2P/8 b - -',so I attack with my King
376,9,87,4Nc1+,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2P3P1/3K4/7P/2n5 w - -',I find myself having to maneuver to bring the Knight under closer scrutiny.
377,9,88,4Kc2,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2P3P1/8/2K4P/2n5 b - -',this creates a need for black to move the Knight once again
378,9,89,4Ne2,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/ppN2P2/2P3P1/8/2K1n2P/8 w - -',By moving the Knight here I have access to a pawn
379,9,90,4cxb5,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/pPN2P2/6P1/8/2K1n2P/8 b - -',so now I am two points ahead - the forced exchange strategy is on!
380,9,91,4Nd4+,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/pPN2P2/3n2P1/8/2K4P/8 w - -',The check ensures that blacks captures a pawn in return and threatens my Bishop at the same time
381,9,92,4Kc3,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/pPN2P2/3n2P1/2K5/7P/8 b - -',This is a disastrous move that ensures the loss of my Bishop and a pawn
382,9,93,4Nxb5+,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/pnN2P2/6P1/2K5/7P/8 w - -',AAAARCG what a mistake...I should not play chess late at night. 
383,9,94,4Kc4,b'6k1/6pp/3B1p2/pnN2P2/2K3P1/8/7P/8 b - -',a futile attempt to chase the Knight down

385,9,96,4Kb3,b'6k1/6pp/3n1p2/p1N2P2/6P1/1K6/7P/8 b - -',so I retreat to prevent the queening of the pawn
386,9,97,4Kf7,b'8/5kpp/3n1p2/p1N2P2/6P1/1K6/7P/8 w - -',My game is in disarray now and I am a pawn down and the black King is on the move
387,9,98,5Ka4,b'8/5kpp/3n1p2/p1N2P2/K5P1/8/7P/8 b - -',So I see a chance to even the score
388,9,99,5Nc4,b'8/5kpp/5p2/p1N2P2/K1n3P1/8/7P/8 w - -',but the black Knight moves to prevent me from doing so
389,9,100,5Kb5,b'8/5kpp/5p2/pKN2P2/2n3P1/8/7P/8 b - -',this move ensures the capture of one or the other
390,9,101,5Ne3,b'8/5kpp/5p2/pKN2P2/6P1/4n3/7P/8 w - -',The Knight moves to stay ahead
391,9,102,5h3,b'8/5kpp/5p2/pKN2P2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 b - -',but I foil him
392,9,103,5Ke7,b'8/4k1pp/5p2/pKN2P2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 w - -',so the King comes to the party essentially surrendering the pawn
393,9,104,5Kxa5,b'8/4k1pp/5p2/K1N2P2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 b - -',which puts on on level terms once again. 
394,9,105,5Kd6,b'8/6pp/3k1p2/K1N2P2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 w - -',Black tries to chase me down with his King
395,9,106,5Nb7+,b'8/1N4pp/3k1p2/K4P2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 b - -',but I turn the tables on him by forcing check
396,9,107,5Ke5,b'8/1N4pp/5p2/K3kP2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 w - -',This is a very interesting position. By all accounts it looks like black has the upper hand
397,9,108,5Nc5,b'8/6pp/5p2/K1N1kP2/6P1/4n2P/8/8 b - -',so I enter the battle
398,9,109,5Kf4,b'8/6pp/5p2/K1N2P2/5kP1/4n2P/8/8 w - -',Black certainly appears to have the upper hand. I have to scramble to stay even.
399,9,110,5Ne6+,b'8/6pp/4Np2/K4P2/5kP1/4n2P/8/8 b - -',This move puts me a pawn ahead for a time
400,9,111,5Kg3,b'8/6pp/4Np2/K4P2/6P1/4n1kP/8/8 w - -',what to do...if I capture the pawn black will capture my pawn and threaten my other pawn
401,9,112,5Nxg7,b'8/6Np/5p2/K4P2/6P1/4n1kP/8/8 b - -',but that is really the only move available
402,9,113,5Kxh3,b'8/6Np/5p2/K4P2/6P1/4n2k/8/8 w - -',so now although even I am about to go a piece down
403,9,114,5g5,b'8/6Np/5p2/K4PP1/8/4n2k/8/8 b - -',so I force the issue Black can't take both pawns at once
404,9,115,5Nxf5,b'8/6Np/5p2/K4nP1/8/7k/8/8 w - -',I think that this is the mistake of the game. If black had taken my pawn with his pawn then he would not have sacrificed his Knight. 
405,9,116,5gxf6,b'8/6Np/5P2/K4n2/8/7k/8/8 b - -',but I do not take the knight instead I take the pawn looking for a queen
406,9,117,5Nd6,b'8/6Np/3n1P2/K7/8/7k/8/8 w - -',black seeing the danger tries to retreat to prevent the queening
407,9,118,6Kb6,b'8/6Np/1K1n1P2/8/8/7k/8/8 b - -',My King returns to the battle
408,9,119,6Kg4,b'8/6Np/1K1n1P2/8/6k1/8/8/8 w - -',and Black follows suit..who will get there first? Who has the advantage (I think I do because of my board position)
409,9,120,6Kc6,b'8/6Np/2Kn1P2/8/6k1/8/8/8 b - -',my King challenges his Knight and he
410,9,121,6Nf7,b'8/5nNp/2K2P2/8/6k1/8/8/8 w - -',retreats to prevent my pawn from advancing
411,9,122,6Kd7,b'8/3K1nNp/5P2/8/6k1/8/8/8 b - -',so I give chase
412,9,123,6Kg5,b'8/3K1nNp/5P2/6k1/8/8/8/8 w - -',"and the black King does so too
"
413,9,124,6Ke7,b'8/4KnNp/5P2/6k1/8/8/8/8 b - -',but this situation favors me
414,9,125,6Kg6,b'8/4KnNp/5Pk1/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Black cannot take either piece with his King because my King is too close
415,9,126,6Ne6,b'8/4Kn1p/4NPk1/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',so I decide to sacrifice my Knight to ensure that I queen
416,9,127,6h5,b'8/4Kn2/4NPk1/7p/8/8/8/8 w - h6',black starts to advance his pawn
417,9,128,6Nf4+,b'8/4Kn2/5Pk1/7p/5N2/8/8/8 b - -',and I place him in check also threatening the pawn
418,9,129,6Kg5,b'8/4Kn2/5P2/6kp/5N2/8/8/8 w - -',this is the expected move forcing me to make a key decision in the game. If I take the pawn then he will take the Knight and then I can take the Knight in return and possibly win the game that way by protecting the pawn and queening it. If I take the Knight and sacrifice my Knight I will get a Queen more quickly and have to scramble to prevent him form queening his pawn..interesting choice...so I choose...
419,9,130,6Kxf7,b'8/5K2/5P2/6kp/5N2/8/8/8 b - -',to take the Knight...sacrificing my Knight and forcing his King to move away from the pawn
420,9,131,6Kxf4,b'8/5K2/5P2/7p/5k2/8/8/8 w - -',which he does. 
421,9,132,6Ke7,b'8/4K3/5P2/7p/5k2/8/8/8 b - -',this was a bad move that almost cost me the game. I should have moved to g6
422,9,133,6h4,b'8/4K3/5P2/8/5k1p/8/8/8 w - -',the race is on
423,9,134,6f7,b'8/4KP2/8/8/5k1p/8/8/8 b - -',At this point I think I am going to win the game!
424,9,135,6h3,b'8/4KP2/8/8/5k2/7p/8/8 w - -',The secret is to get the queen and then keep the black King in check
425,9,136,6f8=Q+,b'5Q2/4K3/8/8/5k2/7p/8/8 b - -',check!
426,9,137,6Kg3,b'5Q2/4K3/8/8/8/6kp/8/8 w - -',so now my strategy must be to force the King to move and progress my King to the battle when I can to try to mate him before he queens
427,9,138,7Qg8+,b'6Q1/4K3/8/8/8/6kp/8/8 b - -',Check
428,9,139,7Kh2,b'6Q1/4K3/8/8/8/7p/7k/8 w - -',this move places him in a pin. I get to advance my King and he tries to force a stalemate
429,9,140,7Kf6,b'6Q1/8/5K2/8/8/7p/7k/8 b - -',now 8 points up I am sure that I will win
430,9,141,7Kh1,b'6Q1/8/5K2/8/8/7p/8/7k w - -',I still have to keep him in check
431,9,142,7Qd5+,b'8/8/5K2/3Q4/8/7p/8/7k b - -',Check
432,9,143,7Kg1,b'8/8/5K2/3Q4/8/7p/8/6k1 w - -',Wise to the idea that he needs to advance his pawn he moves away forcing me to 
433,9,144,7Qd1+,b'8/8/5K2/8/8/7p/8/3Q2k1 b - -',continue to the plan to keep him in check
434,9,145,7Kg2,b'8/8/5K2/8/8/7p/6k1/3Q4 w - -',I can feel the end game developing and I feel confident that a mate will result
435,9,146,7Qg4+,b'8/8/5K2/8/6Q1/7p/6k1/8 b - -',now he has a decision to make..keep the  King near the pawn or try to run away
436,9,147,7Kh2,b'8/8/5K2/8/6Q1/7p/7k/8 w - -',He chooses to protect his pawn but this allows me to advance my King
437,9,148,7Kg5,b'8/8/8/6K1/6Q1/7p/7k/8 b - -',the noose is tightening
438,9,149,7Kh1,b'8/8/8/6K1/6Q1/7p/8/7k w - -',with this move I should capture his pawn
439,9,150,7Qxh3+,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/7Q/8/7k b - -',now the battle is to prevent a stalemate while I advance my King
440,9,151,7Kg1,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/7Q/8/6k1 w - -',he tries to prolong the game
441,9,152,7Qa3,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/Q7/8/6k1 b - -',I ensure that the stalemate is not in the offing
442,9,153,7Kf1,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/Q7/8/5k2 w - -',now I just have to bring my King down and the game is over
443,9,154,7Qa2,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/Q7/5k2 b - -',I prevent him from moving out of the first row with this move
444,9,155,7Ke1,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/Q7/4k3 w - -',he tries to move into a stalemate
445,9,156,7Qc2,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/2Q5/4k3 b - -',I try to limit his range to make the checkmate easier
446,9,157,7Kf1,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/2Q5/5k2 w - -',he does what he can
447,9,158,8Qd2,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/3Q4/5k2 b - -',I close him down
448,9,159,8Kg1,b'8/8/8/6K1/8/8/3Q4/6k1 w - -',he is still thinking stalemate
449,9,160,8Kg4,b'8/8/8/8/6K1/8/3Q4/6k1 b - -',the end draws near and with the advance of my King he sees that mate is inevitable so he resigns...a long but interesting game.

451,10,1,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The Budapest Defence. Black cracks open the positon with an early e5 although he'll have to move his knight again black will be compensated by whites weak central pawns. also people who play 1.d4 tend to prefer closed positions so this provocative opening is good for getting players into unfamiliar positions with lots of tactical traps for white to fall into. note that in the long run white can't hope to hold on to the pawn on e5 except with an early f4 but black will get good compensation for the pawn
452,10,2,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',the main alternative here in Ne4 but due to the responce 4.a3! black ends up with very little play.

But it also makes it hard to achieve active play especially for the dark squared bishop. It makes for very slow play. Also this makes d4 difficult the first of many moves in this game bent on controlling d4. It also makes playing d5 harder which is a normal goal in the Sciilian.

It does however win me a pawn. And it double his pawns though this is not much of a weakness if they are used correctly.

I urge you if you are a beginner to look at why Qe2 is bad and to learn not to make un-necessary and passive checks such as this. When a beginner sees a check his automatic reaction is to check! Checking doesn't necessarily do anything!!! This is a very important rule.

Important Points to be learnt from this game:

1.Do not jump to hasty checks which give your opponent free time and can cause you problems at a later stage.
2.Always consider if checking so dubiously is good for you or if it is just a passive move and does not do anything to enhance/ improve your position.

In this French Defense mini-tournament game white uses a rather passive move (7.h3) to block black's attack against his dark square bishop. Black later takes aim at exactly that square.

Doubling Blacks pawns on f6 (6.Bxf6) was a threat since recapturing with the Q loses the d5 pawn i.e. 6.Bxf6 Qxf6  7.cxd exd  8.Nxd5! but it is too early to know if the Bg5 will be missed. After 5 ...h6 White doesn't have much choice.

Playing in the Center with 7.e4 or 7.dxc will leave me with better control of the Center but it will just open up the position for his 2B which I feel I did not want to allow. My plan at this point is to close up with ...c5 and follow up with an eventual b2-b4-b5 & a2-a4.

It's hard to prove but I just wouldnt feel comfortable giving up e5 & g5 to Whites Knights. I suppose Black can shore up the defense of e5 by playing his doubled f pawn to f6 but then his dark Bishop is locked in again AND his light Bishop now has TWO pawns blocking him instead of just one.

Black made the mistake of losing control of e5 with 9 ...f5 but this is a strategic game nobody is going anywhere. The e5 square isnt going anywhere. I did not want to put my Knight on e5 start some attack on the Queenside only to have to pause to castle because Black played a well-timed ...Rg8!! attacking my undefended g pawn. Castling first does allow Black to cover up the e5 square with 10 ...f6 but my previous note explains why that would just make things worse for his 2B.

Even at the cost of a pawn with 10 ...e5?! 11.Nxe5 (11.dxe Bxc5 12.Nxd5 Be6 13.Nc3 Bd6 and despite being a pawn dow I feel the the 2B and the open g file give Black the better game) 11 ...Nxe5  12.dxe c6! followed up with 13 ...f6 opens up the position for Blacks Bishops.

I was afraid that giving Black another open file on the kingside would help him find counterplay on that side of the board later when I have all my pieces committed on the Queenside. To me that was not worth the pawn. I would rather just slowly squeeze the position rather than win a pawn and possibly allow some counterplay.

I would rather gain momentum on the QS with the traditional order of moves i.e.12.Rb1 a5  13.b3! followed by 14.a3 then 15.b4! & b5! (IF 13.a3? THEN 13 ...a4! & White would never accomplish the b4 push). However with my Ne5 obtaining b2-b4-b5 loses importance since Blacks Nc6 has somewhere to go (...Nxe5) so I decided to create a new target on the Queenside...

With this in mind it is best to attack c6 with long range pieces and manuevering a Knight to a5.

All Black may need to do is ...Bf6 & ...Ke7 in order to clear the way so that the Q and other Rook can swing over to those open files.

I think it is time to get aggressive and play the strategy I mentioned in my last note.

After 18 ...cxb my gut tells me I have to get my Bishop off of a6 before it is entombed with 19 ...b5 so I was going to play 19.Be2. Then I noticed by leaving my Queen on a4 (after 19.Be2) Black can get a protected passed pawn with 19 ...c5!  20.Qc2 c4! & Black has managed to not only neutralize the Queenside BUT... has an endgame trump card with the protected passed pawn on c4. If that isnt enough... now he can proceed with his Kingside play without any worries. Is that scenario worth a whole Rook? I dont know and I dont want to find out so I decided to leave the Ba6 to their fate.

It became very clear to me that Blacks Rook sacrifice totally snubbed my Queenside play leaving him with his Kingside attack. The only thing I have is my material advantage and my passed h pawn. This is where I changed my plans in order to accomadate those two advantages.
811,20,22,2Be2,b'4k3/p1qbbp2/1pp1p3/3p1pr1/1P1P4/2N1P3/P1Q1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Because I felt i had nothing more over on the Queenside & because I feel this Bishop was doing nothing on a6 I wanted to reposition it over towards the Kingside.

This is a good position to demonstrate the importance of Pawns & how they can effect Bishops. Imagine if Black's e6 pawn was on e4 & Black's f5 pawn was on f4! Black's Bishops and their threats against my King would compensate for the material loss.
813,20,24,2f4,b'4k3/p1qb1p2/1ppbp3/3p1pr1/1P1P1P2/2N1P3/P1Q1B1PP/R4RK1 b - f3',The reason for this move was not to protect h2 (21.h4 could have done that & also further my plan) but rather to continue to keep Black's 2Bishops under lock and key. Once things started to roll on the Kingside I did not want Black's Q B to have such easy access to my King's position. Coincidently... I seem to remember regretting the weakness I cause to g3.

In light of my plan (promote the hpawn) I think Black should be re-deploying this Bishop to f6 OR... to h4 to keep my pieces off of e1-f2-g3. Another plan might be ...Ke7 with the idea Qc7-d8-g8(or h8) with the follow up being ...f6 & ...Bd7-e8-h5.

My plan is to promote the h pawn. However Mr. hpawn wont survive much further than h5 without a Rook backing him up. I had a simple plan to play my King to f2 and allow my Rooks to swing over but if I did that now... 24.Kf2? THEN 24 ...Qxf4 followed by ...Qxh4. Nor can I play 24.Rf3 since after 24 ...Rxf3  25.Bxf3 Black's Q still infiltrates with 25 ...Qxf4
How about the weakness of g3? How does that play a part? Imagine if I had a pawn on h2 then obviously Black would not be able to play 23 ...Rg3 here. Why does 23 ...Rg3 bother me? Well one way I wanted to get the Rooks over to the h file without allowing Black's Queen to capture on f4 is (only showing White's moves) 24.Rf3 25.Raf1 26.h4 (remember we put the h pawn back on h2) & 27.Rh3 Problem solved. However since Black is able to cover the f3 square BEFORE I play my Rook there I can no longer use that plan.
*NOTE: All my Stress I was having here on this position is really unneccesary since I am actually winning the game on material. Any exchanges actually help me so in reality... 24.Rf3 is a good move but my inability to veer away from my plan made it impossible to find that move. Be sure to always keep a flexible thought process & do not be afraid to change modify or delete your plans and ideas."

However if i played an immediate 26.Nxd5 then what to do after 26 ...Qd6 Hmmm? Therefore I chose to capture on e5 first so that to limit Black's Queen moves. Two lessons:
1) Undefended pieces are usually a good signpost indicating that a tactic is present!!! The real trick is finding it.
2) It does no good just to go around blindly attacking pieces. This is Chess not Checkers these pieces are mobile!! One would do better by making the enemy pieces as immobile as possible before attacking them."

I'm just learning about openings and have studied only a few to any degree. What I saw was that this is going to cause immediate movement in the center. There is simply no way to avoid it.

I used find those bishop pins knight to King or Queen mystifying. But this time I saw some potential for it. Incredibly the Bishop on b6 would prove to be perfectly placed.

The pawn on b4 is hanging the d-pawn is permanently backwards and black's queenside presence is a minor threat at most.

1445,38,13,Bc6,b'6k1/1p5p/2br1pp1/3p2P1/p2N2P1/P4P2/1PP5/2K1R3 w - -',The bishop is essentially forced to hide behind the d5 pawn. It can't easily relinguish control of d8.
1446,38,14,2Re5,b'6k1/1p5p/2b2rp1/3pR3/p2N2P1/P4P2/1PP5/2K5 b - -',Centralization of the rook? Hmmm.
1447,38,15,2Kd2,b'6k1/1p6/2b2rpp/3pR3/p2N2P1/P4P2/1PPK4/8 b - -',I originally planned on bringing the king over to c5 via b4 and c3.
1448,38,16,3Ke3,b'8/1p3k2/2b2rpp/3pR3/p2N2P1/P3KP2/1PP5/8 b - -',But after spending more time on the position decided to threaten the d5 pawn with the king or moving him to the kingside where black's counter chances are greater.
1449,38,17,Rd8,b'3r4/1p3k2/2b3pp/3pR3/p2N1PP1/P3K3/1PP5/8 w - -',"Notice black's position. The a pawn is blocked. The b pawn defends the bishop. The d pawn is blockaded and helpless. The g and h pawn are tied up by my f and g pawns. Black's bishop and rook are forced on the defensive and I control the open file. 

My knight is immune to attack and controls the critical central squares. My king has more space. 

White has a considerable advantage. Is it enough to win?"
1450,38,18,3f5,b'3r4/1p3k2/2b3pp/3pRP2/p2N2P1/P3K3/1PP5/8 b - -',Played mostly to vacate the f4 square for my king. 
1451,38,19,3Re2,b'8/1p1b1k2/3r2pp/3p1P2/p2N1KP1/P7/1PP1R3/8 b - -',Again a move to vacate a square for my king. It should have gone to e3 but oh well.
1452,38,20,3Rh2,b'8/1p1b1k2/1r5p/3p1P2/p2N1K2/P7/1PP4R/8 b - -',c3 was playable but this is more active.
1453,38,21,3Rf6,b'8/1p1b1k2/5r1p/3p1P2/p2N1K2/P7/1PP4R/8 w - -',Black is obviously rudderless (not to mention hogtied).
1454,38,22,3Ke5,b'8/1p1b1k2/5r1p/3pKP2/p2N4/P7/1PP4R/8 b - -',The rook vacates the crictical e5 square and the king occupies it. The e5 square is the fulcrum of my position and my pieces gain strength by occupying it. The king is extremely strong here.
1455,38,23,3Rh3,b'8/1p3k2/2b2r1p/3pKP2/p2N4/P6R/1PP5/8 b - -',Played with the intention of capturing Rxb3 if after playing b4 black plays axb3 e.p. The white rook seeks the 7th rank where it will drive the enemy king back. The clearest path to the 7th rank is through the b file.
1456,38,24,3Rc3,b'8/1p1b1k2/5r1p/3pKP2/p2N4/P1R5/1PP5/8 b - -',...Or I can use the c-file. If the rook is allowed to go to c7 pinning the bishop against the king I simply win the bishop outright. The king would be forced to go to e7 where Rxd7  Kxd7 would allow Kxf6.
1457,38,25,3Bc6,b'8/1p3k2/2b2r1p/3pKP2/p2N4/P1R5/1PP5/8 w - -',So black has to block the c file.
1458,38,26,axb3e.p.,b'8/1p3k2/2b2r1p/3pKP2/3N4/PpR5/2P5/8 w - -',forced.
1459,38,27,h5,b'8/1p3k2/2b2r2/3pKP1p/3N4/PR6/2P5/8 w - -',I spent a long time on this position. I had winning chances but I kept finding drawn positions (mostly K P R vs K R). However there're a number of tricky areas on the way. One misstep by black and I should win.
1460,38,28,4a4,b'8/1p3k2/2b2r2/3pKP1p/P2N4/1R6/2P5/8 b - -',The pawn is immune. If Bxa4 Rxb7  forces the king away from the defense of the rook and my king captures it. The poor bishop is overworked. A simple removal of the guard (NxB) will cause black's queenside to collapse.
1461,38,29,h4,b'8/1p3k2/2b4r/P2pKP2/3N3p/1R6/2P5/8 w - -',Time to strike.
1462,38,30,4Nxc6,b'8/1p3k2/2N4r/P2pKP2/7p/1R6/2P5/8 b - -',Here's the first test for black. Rxc6 Bxb7  K<any> And I can capture either the d5 pawn or bring my rook to h7. These lines all lead to a draw I believe. The knight stayed on d4 for 26 moves. It had moss growing on it. It put down roots on d4.
1463,38,31,4bxc6,b'8/5k2/2p4r/P2pKP2/7p/1R6/2P5/8 w - -',And here's black's critical error. I simply believe black didn't look far enough ahead to see what the result of this recapture would be. 
1464,38,32,4Rb7+,b'8/1R3k2/2p4r/P2pKP2/7p/8/2P5/8 b - -',First order of buisness: drive the enemy king to the back rank.
1465,38,33,4Ke8,b'4k3/1R6/2p4r/P2pKP2/7p/8/2P5/8 w - -',Now I threaten mate by simply queening my a pawn.
1466,38,34,c5,b'4k3/1R6/P6r/2ppKP2/7p/8/2P5/8 w - -',I have a neat little resource to block the black rook's access to the queenside. I believe black missed it completely when deciding to play 44...bxc6 instead of 44...Rxc6.
1467,38,35,4f6,b'4k3/1R6/P4P1r/2ppK3/7p/8/2P5/8 b - -',"And there we go. The black rook can't get to the queenside fast enough. If 47... Rg6 48. a7 Rg1/Rg3 49. a8=Q#. If the black rook moves to h7 I simply capture it. If the rook goes to h8 it's out of position and unable to prevent the queening of my a pawn. Rh5  slows things down but black's own pawns block the rook and after Ke6 I'm immune to checks (aside from Re5  which doesn't help in the long run).

Black resigned with grace offering me a personal note of congratulations.

1468,39,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I love the Vienna game specifically the vienna gambit when black responds Nf6 as it's like the King's gambit but without the possibility of Qh4  for black...
1469,39,1,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Oh well.  Looks like a vanilla vienna game then.
1470,39,2,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I'm still hoping to play f4 in this position as the extra pressure on black's kingside is something I'm hopeful for.
1471,39,3,f4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid albeit boring but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:
1472,39,4,Bxg1,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1bR w KQkq -',!  This wins a pawn.  While it looks like it may be rough exchanging an active bishop for a knight at home this is I believe the best move in the position.  Observe why.
1473,39,5,Rxg1,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1R1 b Qkq -',This is forced -- I considered Qh5 here but black can defend against any of white's threats and can save the bishop to boot.  White must take.
1474,39,6,Qh4+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1R1 w Qkq -',And so black wins a pawn.  White would love to just play g3 but with the rook no longer protecting the pawn on h2 black is going to win it.
1475,39,7,Kf1,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KR1 b kq -',Of course Ke2 would have been a disaster and Kd2 blocks the bishop in.
1476,39,8,Bg4,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPbq/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KR1 w kq -',A nice in-between move that forces the queen to move.
1477,39,9,Qe1,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPbq/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1B1QKR1 b kq -',The best square for the queen offering a trade.
1478,39,10,Qxh2,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPb1/2NP4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 w kq -',!?  Trading would give black a solid game.  Instead the pawn grabbing allows white a large amount of counterplay but black has a strong attack as well!
1479,39,11,Nd5,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 b kq -',Here it comes!  The first threat: Nxc7 
1480,39,12,O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 w - -',!  The best move as this gets the king out of the center.  Castling on opposite sides often foreshadows attacks on opposite sides of the board.
1481,39,13,1Be3,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3PB3/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 b - -',Pointing the bishop at the enemy's king.  Maybe Qc3 is worth considering here but it runs into the tactical problem of Be2  which looks pretty strong for black.
1482,39,14,1exf4,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N4/2B1Ppb1/3PB3/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 w - -',One of those moves that players around my level LOVE to make -- wait until an opponent moves a piece then immediately force it to move again.  But this doesn't get an exclam because after the recapture...
1483,39,15,1Bxf4,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N4/2B1PBb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 b - -',White tempos the queen.
1484,39,16,1Qh5,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N3q/2B1PBb1/3P4/PPP3P1/R3QKR1 w - -',The best square allowing the queen scope along the 5th rank.
1485,39,17,1Qc3,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N3q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/PPP3P1/R4KR1 b - -',! Aggressive!  Threatening Qxg7 and also pressuring the black king.
1486,39,18,1f6,b'2kr2nr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/3N3q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/PPP3P1/R4KR1 w - -',Mandatory as Nf6 allows white to win his pawn back.
1487,39,19,1b4,b'2kr2nr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/3N3q/1PB1PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - b3',Again very aggressive.  This is maybe the critical point in the game where white is trying to make something happen.  My idea is to kick out the knight on c6 and try to mate black down the c-file.
1488,39,20,1Nge7,b'2kr3r/ppp1n1pp/2np1p2/3N3q/1PB1PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',Very good.  Threatening to swap knights and blunt white's attack.

1490,39,22,1b5,b'3r3r/ppk1n1pp/2np1p2/1P5q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - -',Yes!  This has the fantastic threat of N-moves Bf7  winning the queen!  This is a critical point in this game for white and black both.
1491,39,23,1Ng6,b'3r3r/ppk3pp/2np1pn1/1P5q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',Defending against the threat and hitting the Bf4 forcing white to address that counterthreat.  Both sides have a great attack and it's a question of whose will get there first.
1492,39,24,1Bd5,b'3r3r/ppk3pp/2np1pn1/1P1B3q/4PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - -',???????  Augh!  No!  No no no no no!  This was one of the worst moves I could've made.  I just gave up a bishop for free with no compensation.  The Bf4 was very important as it helped hold down defense of the kingside.  How could I just ignore it?  I mistakenly thought that after I played Bxc6 on my 17th black would play bxc6 and I would terrorize him with my queen advanced pawn and possibly the rook down the b-file forcing a victory.  It's amazing what even good players can overlook.
1493,39,25,1Nxf4,b'3r3r/ppk3pp/2np1p2/1P1B3q/4Pnb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',Winning the bishop and hence the game.

1495,39,27,1Qc5,b'3r3r/ppk3pp/2Bp1p2/1Pq5/4Pnb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',!  Stopping any threat that white has and effectively ending the game.  White has nothing better than to exchange queens and simply go to a piece-down endgame.  I played on for a few more moves but I could have resigned here.
1496,39,28,1Qa5+,b'3r3r/ppk3pp/2Bp1p2/QPq5/4Pnb1/3P4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - -',Desperately trying to keep the firepower on the board and hoping for a horrid mistake like b6.
1497,39,29,1Kb8,b'1k1r3r/pp4pp/2Bp1p2/QPq5/4Pnb1/3P4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',With his king in a safe place black suddenly has the horrible threat of Be2 ! winning two rooks.
1498,39,30,1d4,b'1k1r3r/pp4pp/2Bp1p2/QPq5/3PPnb1/8/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - -',Aaah I think if I can play b6 I can play for a sneaky sneaky mate...
1499,39,31,1Qxd4,b'1k1r3r/pp4pp/2Bp1p2/QP6/3qPnb1/8/P1P3P1/R4KR1 w - -',Renewing the old threat.  Unfortunately now I see that 20. b6 runs into Be2  21. Ke2 Qxg1  22. Kd2 Qxb6 nullifying the threat and winning a rook.
1500,39,32,2Re1,b'1k1r3r/pp4pp/2Bp1p2/QP6/3qPnb1/8/P1P3P1/4RKR1 b - -',Defending the e2 square...
1501,39,33,2Be2+,b'1k1r3r/pp4pp/2Bp1p2/QP6/3qPn2/8/P1P1b1P1/4RKR1 w - -',"! But simply not enough times.  After Rxe2 black simply had an overwhelming material advantage plus the queen will still defend the a7-g1 diagonal.  White has a huge disadvantage and no threats so I resigned.

Still it was an incredible attacking game by both sides until the disastrous miscalculation on my part at move 16.  Now Rob is #2 and I am #3 but I plan on changing that soon!  Look out for the rematch buddy!"
