68,3,3,2Bb4,b'2rq1rk1/4bppp/p7/1p1p2P1/1BpP1P2/P3P3/1P4QP/2R2RK1 b - -',!? -- This move weakens White's Q-side considerably but that's not where his King lives. White's speculating that his attack will make good before Black's counterattack and he's willing not only to weaken his position on the Q-side to make it happen but to part with material too.
69,3,4,2Rf4,b'3r1rk1/5ppp/p2q4/1p1p1PP1/1PpP1R2/4P3/1P4QP/2R3K1 b - -',!? -- Looks like the start of a pretty good plan: Rf4-h4 followed by Qh3 with Black unable to push his h-pawn. Too bad I didn't do it.

71,3,6,2h5,b'3r1rk1/6pp/p4p2/1p1p1PPP/1qpP1R2/4P3/1P4Q1/2R3K1 b - -',! - Every open line helps White.
72,3,7,2Qxg5,b'3r1rk1/6pp/p7/1p1p1PQP/1qpP1R2/4P3/1P6/2R3K1 b - -',Giving up even more material to keep the attack alive.
73,3,8,2Qxb2,b'3r1rk1/6pp/p7/1p1p1PQP/2pP1R2/4P3/1q6/2R3K1 w - -',Black has a crushing endgame advantage with those connected Q-side triplets. All he has to do now is live long enough to push them ...
74,3,9,3Rf2,b'5rk1/3r2pp/p7/1p1p1PQP/2pP2R1/4P3/4qR2/6K1 b - -',A split-second pause to create a haven for the King with tempo.
75,3,10,3Kg2,b'5rk1/3r2pp/p7/1p1p1PQP/2pP2R1/4P3/5RK1/4q3 b - -',Now Black has no checks.

79,3,14,Kxg7,b'1Q6/6k1/p4r2/1p1p1P2/2pP4/4q3/5RK1/8 w - -',What? What? WHAT? Is he just toying with me now? 38. ...Qg5  39. Kf1 Rf5 mops up easily. This hasty King move lets White climb more than halfway out of the hole he had dug for himself.
80,3,15,Qg5+,b'8/5rk1/p7/1p1Q1Pq1/2pP4/8/5RK1/8 w - -',Played after a long think. Black's still winning but a lot of his advantage evaporated with that d-pawn. Now everybody's got passed pawns but it's still White who can make best use of the open lines.!
81,3,16,4Kf1,b'8/5rk1/p7/1p1Q1Pq1/2pP4/8/5R2/5K2 b - -',Threatening the very nasty 42. Rg2. Black's King is exposed to more danger than White's. Both of us were getting a little short on time at this point.

83,3,18,Kh6,b'Q7/5r2/p4q1k/1p3P2/2pP4/8/6R1/5K2 w - -',Black is trying to trap me: on 47. Rg6?? Qg6! wins. I'll have none of that silliness however.
84,3,19,Kg5,b'Q7/5r2/p4q2/1p3Pk1/2pP4/8/7R/5K2 w - -',! -- I just hate players who keep making the correct moves!  >:-( ...Just kidding. Of course now my desired Queen check on g2 is no good because Black can just take the f-pawn with his King because White's Rook can't go to f2. So ...
85,3,20,5Rg2+,b'Q7/5r2/p4q2/1p3Pk1/2pP4/8/6R1/5K2 b - -',And here White offered a draw which Black accepted. It's perpetual check.
86,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I wanted to show this game as it demonstrates an unjustified sacrifice. 
87,4,1,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',My favorite variation. It immediately attacks the center and I have a fetish for c-pawn moves in the opening. 
88,4,2,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2PP4/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',d5 is another option but at this time I did not want to exchange my d-pawn for the c-pawn. 
89,4,3,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Inviting to close off the center with d5 with a permanent doubled pawn or for the center to be broken up. 
90,4,4,1Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2PP4/P1PBP3/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White's black-squared bishop does not have much chance for mobility. Maybe the idea of a4 Ba3 would be good. Instead white sacrifices a pawn for activity. 
91,4,5,Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4n3/2P5/P2BP3/1B1N2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The issue is that I get good activity as well. Now the c-pawn is going to be my main focus.  
92,4,6,1Ne4,b'2rq1rk1/p4ppp/3pbn2/1p2n3/2P1NR2/P3P3/1BB1Q1PP/R5K1 b - -',Instead of further protecting the pawn white goes on an attack that seems quite promising. 
93,4,7,1Bxh7+,b'2rq1rk1/p4ppB/3p4/1p2n3/2b2R2/P3P3/1B2Q1PP/R5K1 b - -',I had calculated variations after Nxe4 and couldn't see any death notes by white so I continued with exchange. 
94,4,8,2Qh5+,b'2rq1r2/p4ppk/3p4/1p2n2Q/2b2R2/P3P3/1B4PP/R5K1 b - -',Looks menacing but it does not come to any conclusion. This is a case where one player does not want to defend and instead acts on the offense. White acted in desperation when there was no need. If the game had continued with a defensive strategy white would have an uncomfortable game but he would have drawing chances.   
95,4,9,f6,b'2rq1rk1/p5p1/3p1p2/1p2n2Q/2b4R/P3P3/1B4PP/R5K1 w - -',The key move in my calculations. After f6 the king can run away to safety. All white's sacrifices have amounted to nothing because of one defensive move. The last game I played with this opponent he had similar game against me. Maybe he overestimated his chances. 
96,5,0,Bg4,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/2P3b1/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Not the sort of thing you see every day but hardly a bad move. Other playble ideas are 4. ...e5 ...Nc6 ...Nf6 and even ...c5.

But Black has now rather needlessly exposed his Queen and now I start thinking about how best to exploit the miscue.

Allowing Black to fork d5 and Ra5 clinches the finish though Black must play carefully to avoid a stalemate or the loss of his own pawn once the Rooks are gone. Better for White was 50.Re1+ Kxd5 51.Rd1 realizing that the d-pawn cannot be saved and instead making an attempt at preventing Black from getting his c-pawn across the board.

189,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hey all! This begins as the uncommon Fraser Variation of the Latvian Gambit but quickly veers into territory I've never seen before. White makes an unusual choice on move six and together we explore the resulting variations. Enjoy!
190,9,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and generally more) in exchange for open lines and a developmental advantage.
191,9,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! The Fraser Variation hoping somewhat naively for 4.Nxc6 dxc6 with great potential for Black.
192,9,3,Qh5+,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is the standard continuation. After 4...g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 the line splits between 6.Qh3 and 6.Qh4 each with its own very sharp variations. I believe I have some annotated games in each of these lines.
193,9,4,Qxf5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp3p/2n2nN1/5Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',?! I have never seen this before and cannot find literature to support it. Intuitively it seems somewhat inferior as it seems to allow Black to recoup most of his material losses and continue his development with tempo by chasing the WQ around. The question now as it always is in the Latvian is whether Black can find the right moves to do so without falling into a trap.
194,9,5,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p1Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq d6',This seems logical. Perhaps 6...d6 is a bit safer but there's no point playing an aggressive opening and then trying to be safe about it.
195,9,6,Qg5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',? The Knight cannot really be defended; this move invites Black to develop his Rook to the open g-file. More direct was perhaps 7.Qf3 or 7.Qf4.
196,9,7,Bb5,b'r1bqkbr1/ppp4p/2n2nN1/1B1p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',Hoping perhaps to bait Black into playing 8...Bd7 losing the d-pawn. Otherwise this allows Qe5+ but after that I don't see any real threats at White's disposal and he'll be even further behind in development.
197,9,8,1g3,b'r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B1pQ3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K2R b KQq -',? Black's position is a bit ugly but it's also rock-solid. White on the other hand has hardly any active pieces and has just created huge kingside holes at f3 and h3. 10.Rg1 was a better if terribly passive way to defend the g-pawn.
198,9,9,1dxe4,b'r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B2Q3/4p3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K2R w KQq -',Taking the opportunity to destroy White's claim to the center and restrict the d-pawn and therefore also White's QB.
199,9,10,Qd7,b'r1b1k3/pppqb2p/2n2nr1/1B2Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R w KQq -',If now 12.Nxe4?? Nxe5 13.Bxd7+ Bxd7 and Black is unstoppable.
200,9,11,1Bxc6,b'r1b1k3/pppqb2p/2B2nr1/4Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQq -',White wants to keep his centralized Queen but trading off his other active pieces isn't helping his development any.
201,9,12,1Rg1,b'r1b1k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq -',Avoiding a nasty discovered attack from ...e3. Again this should have been played on move ten to save time.
202,9,13,1Bg4,b'r3k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 w Qq -',Black's development is nearly complete this Bishop will be nearly impossible to remove and as a result White will now have a hard time getting his King out of the center.
203,9,14,O-O-O,b'2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/1PN3P1/P1PP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',The Bishop is not sacrificed as 15.Qxe7 Qxc3! 16. Rb1 maintains Black's advantage just fine (16.dxc3?? Rd1#).
204,9,15,1Bb2,b'2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/1PN3P1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',? 15.Qxe7 was correct here as the seemingly-dangerous response 15...Qxc3?? (thinking 16.dxc3 Rd1#) is actually terrible for Black as White may respond with 16.Qxd8+ Kxd8 17.dxc3 and White will win. I missed this continuation in the game (and in this annotation until dragon_checkmate pointed it out to me); luckily for me so did White!
205,9,16,1Bf3,b'2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 w Q -',?? This move is fine in general making sure the Bishop is completely unassailable and preventing the WK from ever escaping to g2 but Black offers up his DSB for no solid reason. 15...Bc5 would have been stronger I think.
206,9,17,1Qxe7,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q2nr1/8/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',White does not overlook it this time. Black must make full use of his mobility to produce a winning attack before White can consolidate. With the Bishop out of the way and the WK stuck in the center opening and abusing the e- and d-files looks like the most effective method of attack.
207,9,18,1Nd5,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q3r1/3n4/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 w Q -',Black sacrifices the h-pawn in an attempt to draw the WQ away from her defensive duties.
208,9,19,1Nxd5,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q3r1/3N4/4p3/1P3bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',I think this move is questionable but I don't really see any better options. Taking on h7 seems pretty risky but the text hands Black a d-file battery on a silver platter so...
209,9,20,1Bc3,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/6r1/3q4/4p3/1PB2bP1/P1PP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',I think White must soon forfeit his Queen one way or another. She's remained on the e-file too long and White is out of free tempi. This move is probably superior to 18.d3 (losing to ...exd3 with the dual threats of ...Re6+ and ...d2+). 18.Qb4 just results in the Queen being chased around by 18...Rb6 so that doesn't help much either.
210,9,21,1d3,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/6r1/1q6/4p3/1PBP1bP1/P1P2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',The only move. Black has finally forced an opening on the e-file.
211,9,22,2Kd2,b'2kr4/ppp1Q2p/6r1/1q6/8/1PBp1bP1/P1PK1P1P/R5R1 b - -',Again this is probably the best option. White makes a run for the Queenside.
212,9,23,2Re8,b'2k1r3/ppp1Q2p/6r1/1q6/8/1PBp1bP1/P1PK1P1P/R5R1 w - -',But now White must give up his precious Queen or else lose by force after 21...Re2+.
213,9,24,2cxd3,b'2k5/ppp4p/6r1/1q6/8/1PBP1bP1/P2K1P1P/4R1R1 b - -',White will only have a chance if he can double his Rooks on the e-file or create counterplay with his pawn majority. So naturally Black will seek to use his fantastic mobility create a series of active threats that White cannot ignore and slowly gain position and material until his advantages are overwhelming.
214,9,25,2Ra6,b'2k5/ppp4p/r7/1q6/8/1PBP1bP1/P2K1P1P/4R1R1 w - -',Drawing the Rook off the e-file and back into Rook Hell--guarding a second-rank pawn. 
215,9,26,Rd6,b'2k5/ppp4p/3r4/1q6/8/1PBP1bP1/P2K1P1P/R5R1 w - -',"0-1. With no e-file Rook there's no way to guard this pawn adequately. Either it falls now or the Bishop does after 25.d4 Qe2+ 26.Kc1 Rc6! White sees it and resigns. As so frequently happens in this opening one or two slight inaccuracies early on lead to hugely exploitable weaknesses and the highly-tactical midgame was too quick and violent to allow White to convert his pawn advantage.

216,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This game is The Proof once for all that ""My Scandinavian"" doesn't work against d5. I regretfully have to admit that. 
""My Scandinavian"" is a way to proceed into the Scandiavian that gave me very nice moments surprisingly tactic games won by black with sacs on the queenside. 
I suspected that it won't hold against d5 but the truth is that ALMOST NOBODY goes for an early d5 not even (standard) chess engines (I don't use them but I remember I tried sometimes in the last years). 
Now I tested the opening with a strong player and I fell miserably. 

Incidentally the game could have been the scenario for an interesting tactic strike by black and I wonder if I (black) could have sustained my ""crazy"" sac. "
217,10,1,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"This seems a ""naive"" move. It is not. The queen is going to c7 taking advantage of the check tempo. White can avoid that of course but has to half-scramble his game in order to do that and there is no need for it since white is in no danger. "
218,10,2,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Normal taking advantage of dev+tempo.

220,10,4,Be2,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The most common answer. Qe2 is seldom seen and I personally go QxQ. It is not clear (form me but I don't read books :-( ) if after this black can catch up in developement and reach equality. I have a nice win in my early annotated games. Ne2 is not bad since it helps in supporting f5 (that will become very important later) and the lsb can try to fianchetto. Nobody does that but I think I would go for it as white. 
221,10,5,c6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Necessary to avoid knight's jumps.
222,10,6,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Normal.
223,10,7,Qc7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now it seems that black is heavily undeveloped and he IS. True is that his developement has been tested in hundred of games and I have a very good score with it. I have no weak points and all my pieces has places to go. 
224,10,8,Bf5,b'rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',"This is the first moment I go ""my way"" really. I just don't like the bishop to be trapped in after e6. I know that this bishop can be exchanged with the knight in 3 eventually but it's ok provided I use this to open the h column to my rook. This compensates black's position enough to equalize. In most cases. But I think that 7. d5 is just crusching for black. But nobody goes for it. "
225,10,9,O-O,b'rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Normal. Now until now I assumed that with e6 I am out of danger. That's not true as this game will demostrate. 
226,10,10,d5,b'rn2kbnr/ppq2ppp/2p1p3/3P1b2/8/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Now the point is that if exd5 after Re1 white has so many threats over black's position that I just consider that it is not a desirable game for black. Nxd5 cxd5 Bb5++ and only a miracle can save black. Similar destiny happened after cxd5. Now I had to opt among several moves considering both white pawns' take on the next move...
227,10,11,Nd7,b'r3kbnr/ppqn1ppp/2p1p3/3P1b2/8/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',"I didn't intend anyway to answer dxc6 with Nxc6. By experience I know that this knight will be soon under heavy attack and that it is much better to have a pawn in c6 (at ""any cost"") than a knight. This also opens a quick way for a surprise queenside castling bringing the rook junt in front of white's queen. This can be a good resource in this line. I hold white's attacks on the queenside. "
228,10,12,Nd4,b'r3kbnr/ppqn1ppp/2p1p3/3P1b2/3N4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',"A hoax. I can't allow white to exchange my bishop and open the e column. But after I retire it to g6 (no N moves were good to cover it) dxe6 leaves black in a very weak position and I didn't want to play in such a disastrous position. So once I assumed that ""My Scandinavian"" is just crap I tried to have fun and get tactic. "

If black could move now Ng4 is very strong. After it Bxh2+ becomes a mate threat since Kh1 Bg1!! and black threats two mates at once no matter which minor piece is taken. Very nice indeed. White can defend with f5 then e6xf4ep and the threat is renewed. This time white can save just maybe but he won't like the game at all. 
Now I realize it NOW. During the game I was looking for Nf3 (in order to avoid f5 that ruins all my plan) and a lot of tactic lines came to my mind. It was fun but confusing.

This is a game from a recent team match in which I set up a wild attack chase the Black King across the board and probably have a winning endgame before succumbing to my greed snatching a pawn and watching my empire come crashing down around me. Enjoy!

305,12,7,1Bh6+,b'r2qrk2/bpp2p2/p1np1p1B/5b2/2PP4/7P/PP2NPB1/R2QK2R b KQ -',?! Forcing the King to either block in the Rook or come back into the open. I'm not sure this was such a great idea; it simply allows the BK to head for cover without losing time.
306,12,8,1Qa4,b'r2qr3/bpp1kp2/p1np1p1B/5b2/Q1PP4/7P/PP2NPB1/R3K2R b KQ -',? Threatening c6 slightly but the Queen can be easily repelled and this doesn't do much for the attack. Furthermore it leaves the King as the only defender of e2.
307,12,9,1Nf4,b'r2qr3/bppbkp2/p1np1p1B/8/Q1PP1N2/7P/PP3PB1/R3K2R b KQ -',As Black has trapped his King on the kingside I decide to turn up the pressure since he's about to play ...Nxd4 and win time against my Queen. Both Kings are looking terribly exposed.
308,12,10,1Nd5+,b'r2qr3/bppbkp2/p2p1p1B/3N4/Q1Pn4/7P/PP3PB1/R3K2R b KQ -',If only my Queen were still on d1 this would be devastating.

310,12,12,2O-O-O,b'r1kqN3/2p2p2/p1ppn3/5Q2/2Pb4/7P/PP3P2/2KR3R b - -',With the Ne6 pinned Black's Bishop--his most active piece by a large margin--is now threatened. There's no time to take on e8 or play ...Rb8.
311,12,13,2Nxd6+,b'r2q4/1kp2p2/p1pNn3/5Q2/2Pb4/7P/PP3P2/2KR3R b - -',? I think 28.Qxf7 was better.
312,12,14,2Rd2,b'r7/1kp2p2/p1pqn3/5Q2/2Pb4/7P/PP1R1P2/2K4R b - -',I see 29...Qb4 and the ensuing attack and move to preempt it. At this point I have a dangerous h-pawn and pretty decent mobility so I should have decent endgame chances once I deal with the Black push on the queenside.
313,12,15,3Qxf7,b'r7/1kp2Q2/p1p1n3/2b5/1qP5/7P/PPR2P2/2K4R b - -',?? Black could have defended this pawn last move but chose not to--that should have been a clue that I ought not to take it. This is if not the fatal misstep then the first of two blunders that cost me the game. I don't think Black's attack is strong enough to give me problems even with the possibility of ...Rf8 or ...Nd4 and I give in to the temptation of the free pawn.
314,12,16,3Rd2,b'r7/1kp2Q2/p1p5/2b5/1qPn4/7P/PP1R1P2/2K4R b - -',? If the previous move was non-fatal this one surely is. The only way I can see to hold was to give up the Rook with 32.Qh7 Nxc2 33.Qxc2 and my kingside pawns may give me enough counterplay to stay in the game. The text refusing to give up my material edge loses by force.
315,12,17,3Qxf8,b'5Q2/1kp5/p1p5/2b5/1qPn4/7P/PP1R1P2/2K4R b - -',33.Qh7 Qxc4+ 34.Kd1 Qa4+ 35.b3 Nxb3 is no better.
316,12,18,Nc5,b'8/1kp5/p1p4b/2n2q2/8/P2R3P/1PK2P2/3R4 w - -',"0-1. Further crippling material loss is inevitable and White resigns. Sometimes a greedy play can work out for the best--but sometimes all the enemy pawns are poisoned. This was a fairly instructive game I thought in making absolutely sure you haven't missed any combinations before taking a ""gift"". Thanks very much to Bobby for the fun games!

This game is brought to you by the phrase ""no quarter."" Enjoy!"

325,13,8,1e4,b'r4rk1/pp2b3/2ppqnpp/2n2p2/2P1P3/1PN3PP/PBQ2PB1/4RRK1 b - -',White declares that Black's grip on e4 is insufficient and throws down the second challenge this time backed by his heavy pieces. The horns blow the armies rush at each other and the war begins in earnest. There's at least one capture or check every move for the rest of the game.
326,13,9,2Bxe4,b'r4rk1/pp2b3/2ppqnpp/8/2P1B3/1P4PP/PBQ2P2/4RRK1 b - -',Daring Black to engage in a mating race against the powerful White Bishops.
327,13,10,2Qxh3,b'r4rk1/pp2b3/2pp1npp/8/2P1B3/1P4Pq/PBQ2P2/4RRK1 w - -',? Naturally but I think incorrectly Black accepts. He needs to gain enough tempo for ...Ng4 and ...Qh2# while at the same time White needs only to arrive safely on h7 for his own decisive strike. I think Black might hold with 20...Nxe4 and against White's superior mobility and awesome Bishops a hold is what he should be looking for.
328,13,11,2Bxg6,b'r4rk1/pp2b3/2pp1nBp/8/2P5/1P4Pq/PBQ2P2/4RRK1 b - -',Now both players are all-in.
329,13,12,2Rf7,b'r5k1/pp2br2/2pp1nBp/8/2P5/1P4Pq/PBQ2P2/4RRK1 w - -',If forced to defend we'll sacrifice material to eliminate crucial enemy forces! Unfortunately 21...Rae8 is not sufficient as after 22.Bxe8 the Bishop cannot be taken or mate follows: 22...Rxe8?? 23.Qg6+ Kf8 24.Bxf6 or 22...Nxe8?? 23.Qg6+ Ng7 Qxg7#. So this particular Rook sacrifice is a necessary step before ...Ng4 preventing Bh7+ and stopping the White Rook from rampaging down to e7...
330,13,13,2Rxe7,b'r5k1/pp2Rr2/2pp1nBp/8/2P5/1P4Pq/PBQ2P2/5RK1 b - -',! Or not as the case may be. White seems all too eager to throw material at his problems but his attack is looking more and more decisive. Will he have enough energy to finish the job?
331,13,14,2Ng4,b'r5k1/pp2Rr2/2pp2Bp/8/2P3n1/1P4Pq/PBQ2P2/5RK1 w - -',22...Rxe7 23.Bxf6 Rc7 24.Re1 is unwinnable so go for the gold and play to steal just one more tempo!

White no longer needs a mating net--his enormous positional and material advantage will secure the win once Black's threat is off the table and this move forces the Knight to trade itself in leaving Black without an attack. (If 26...Kc8?? 27.Re8#)
334,13,17,2Rxf6,b'r2k4/pp5B/2pp1R1p/8/2P5/1P4Pq/P1Q2P2/4R1K1 b - -',1-0. Black's attack has fizzled and he sacrificed too much to be able to keep fighting. Many thanks to aramberber for this very fun tactical game and thanks to you for reading!

336,14,1,3cxb5,b'8/7k/p1q1p2p/1P4p1/3Qp3/1P5P/P3KPP1/8 b - -',mistake I think
337,14,2,Qc1+,b'8/7k/4p2p/1p4p1/3Qp3/1P2K2P/P4PP1/2q5 w - -',he took 30 minutes to make the next move for some reason.  He said there was a perpetual as he didn't want me to take the a2 pawn.  Frankly I wouldn't have taken it as it looses the e e and b pawns.
338,14,3,4Qe4+,b'8/7k/4p2p/1p4p1/4Q3/1P2K2P/P4Pq1/8 b - -',this seems like a pretty stupid move to me but what do I know.
339,14,4,4Kxe4,b'8/7k/4p2p/1p4p1/4K3/1P5P/P4P2/8 b - -',Fun fact: I thought I lost because of a5 - it took me 10 minutes to figure out that I could push to b4 - I clearly don't understand how pawns work.
340,14,5,4Kc4,b'8/7k/4p3/6pp/1pK5/1P5P/P4P2/8 b - -',And here I blundered wait for it.
341,14,6,4g4,b'8/7k/4p3/7p/1pK3p1/1P5P/P4P2/8 w - -',I was convinced that the pawn has to take.  I honestly didn't think that he could play h4.  How blind am I.  I was sure I had won hehe.  If I had played h5 instead I think that was a win.
342,14,7,4h4,b'8/7k/4p3/7p/1pK3pP/1P6/P4P2/8 b - -',so after that blunder I committed another!

It allows white to double the c pawns as well but that is not the best since the c6 knight should remain a target. The best move for white is the most active move.
346,15,1,Nxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/5P2/2n2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',7...Nxf4 8.d4 with plenty of activity for the pawn.

By move nine I have offered up a pawn to the opponent twice already. If you see a sacrifice for a gain in activity you should always just play it after calculating the basic variations. Since gaining activity is the main goal of chess you will be doing the right thing. Usually the opponent cannot use a pawn actively until the endgame. Most players are afraid to sacrifice activity unless it leads to a direct attack against the opponent's king. They are under the delusion that the opponent can simply neutralize their activity and trade to an endgame where their material is decisive. Certainly that CAN happen and the activity is a temporary advantage. Yet it is a much greater advantage than a pawn and can easily lead to a quick win as well as gaining other permanent advantages. There are countless obstacles a player needs to pass before consolidating a pawn advantage. Also it is much harder to find good moves when you have less activity because that implies a defence. The attacker just makes threats while the defender needs to check the opponent's tactics and think much harder.
348,15,3,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/1Bp2P2/8/2P2N2/P1PP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',By the way when I played 9.f5 I did not know whether or not the sacrifice is objectively best. However I knew that it was the right decision to increase my activity. If a sacrifice increases your activity you should calculate the main lines then play it. Deep intuition and other grandmaster like skills are not needed to play a sacrifice.
349,15,4,1d4,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/2nqb3/1Bp1N3/3P4/2P5/P1P3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq d3',White is now gaining a lot of activity in the position and the removal of the f pawn has freed the rook and the dark squared bishop. The position is very open so we should do piece play in the center.
350,15,5,Qb6,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/1q2b3/1Bp1B3/3P4/2P5/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The first step to make a successful attack is to 1.Gain Piece Activity more than your opponent. If your opponent has the better activity he will easily counter your weaker forces and repulse your attack. But your more active pieces will overwhelm the defense easily if they are more active than them. Gaining activity is simple: Develop your pieces on the squares where they are most advanced and can also go to other forward squares. Also do not capture the opponent's pieces unless you can get a tactical advantage since that will increase your opponent's activity while decreasing yours. By the way notice I am not talking about doubled pawns open files and space etc. The chess books offer these ideas to think about a position but it is too much. All these ideas are smaller aspects of activity. Doubled pawns if really weak will always reduce the activity of your pieces or allow the opponent's pieces to become active by attacking the weakness. Open files if occupied naturally give you activity. Just thinking about activity in general is much more useful for most class players to avoid getting too confused.
351,15,6,1Bd3,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/1q2b3/2p1B3/3P4/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',We will now attack on the kingside since we have a solid grip on the center. 
352,15,7,1g6,b'r4rk1/pp2bp1p/1q2b1p1/2p1B3/3P4/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Mistake creating the weaknesses around the kingside. As you can see the dark squared bishop's activity is increased and the queen can suddenly go to the dark squares. The light squared bishop seems to be deactivated but that is not true. The bishop is still hitting at the kingside and preventing the h and f pawns from moving forward since it would be more effective if they did.
353,15,8,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/pp2bp1p/1q2b1p1/2p1B3/3P4/2PB4/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Seems so natural and strong preparing ...Bf8. However here is another rule: When you have activity advantage you must be on the lookout every turn for combinations and tactical shots. Activity creates these tactics. ...f6 was stronger even though it weakens the kingside. 
354,15,9,1Bxg6,b'r2r2k1/pp2bp1p/1q2b1B1/2p1B3/3P4/2P5/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 b - -',The best move in the position although it takes Shredder only a few seconds to see it. Taking with either the h or f pawn causes black to lose horribly. The second stage is 2.Turn your activity into an attack by gathering your pieces to the area and make threats. Moves Bd3 and Qd2 served that purpose. 3.The decisive combination is when you break the opponent's position and undergo a tactical operation right now.

356,15,11,1Bxh7+,b'r2r2k1/pp2bp1B/1q6/2p1B3/2bP4/2P5/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Very strong move against the king destroying it's cover completely and opening it to the mercy of the ideally placed attacking pieces that white has. You may ask: Why did he play this? Why did he not just consolidate his pawn advantage? Well I knew that black would be under serious pressure here and that he would make further mistakes after this Tal Like sacrifice. In open positions attacking is much easier than defending since the numerous attacking possibilities each need to be counted and prevented while the attacker simply makes threats and find tactics. Even though not objectively correct this move is really not risking much. Many masters would not find the best moves in the variations which computer says only draws for them at best.

362,15,17,2Qg7,b'r7/pp2b1QR/1q1rk3/2p1Bp2/2bP4/2P5/P1P3PP/R5K1 b - -',"Black is now losing decisive material in all lines so he gave up. As a summary on the attack we need 3 steps usually. 
1.Gain Superior Activity-Put your pieces forward as much as you can and restrict the opponent's activity.
2.Convert-Use your superior activity to create threats. The concentration of pieces on an area is the best way to do this.
3.Decisive Blow-Once you have a concentration of pieces and create all sorts of threats sooner or later you are bound to have a decisive combination to blast the opponent to pieces. You should always be on the lookout for tactics but think about possible combinations on every turn once step 1 is achieved. Sometimes it is not always so easy to just follow the 3 steps- there are more and this is the general way to do it. Your opponent will also try to gain activity and attack you. At some point you will have contact and the more active side will prevail. That is why activity is the #1 thing in chess."

I saw to possibilities: exchange my bishop for his knight (I lose a bishop against a knight something quite normal in this opening but only when you keep the initiative. In this case I had lost the initiative and could end up in an endgame with an open position with knight-bishop against two bishops) or protect my bishop either with Bb3 or Nc3 and here is where I had problems. Fortunately bigpeta took this game as a masterclass and helped me to take a decision with some useful tips. Thanks bigpeta.

Two possible moves came to my mind: Be3 offering the bishop exchange and Bg5 to put pressure over the black king side.

I was preparing f4 and I didn't want my bishop pinned just in case exf4 happens and I decided to take with that bishop. My idea was to start an attack with the rooks opening the f column bring the bishop on a4 back to the game moving it to b3 putting pressure over the a2-g8 diagonal (taking advantage of the problem in developing the black LSB).

Can you give a good plan for what both sides are trying to achieve and their future middlegame plans with good play? To play an opening effectively you must understand the plans of both sides that will happen in the middlegame and their goals in the opening. Black here is trying to gain a solid grip upon the center without having to block in the light bishop. On the other hand he falls by a tempo in development. So white should not waste time but play aggressively in most of the lines. Black should hold his position using a favorable pawn structure and his stronger light squared bishop will help him later on if he gets out of the opening without concessions. But the position is only at move 1 so really it is a bit early to say. But the rule stands- *If you don't deeply understand an opening it is not really part of your repertoire: you only memorized the moves which is not as useful.*
517,23,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White is gaining the central space and helping out development. By the way you saw that the black's move of 1...c6 did not help development in any way. In the opening we should mainly play moves of the pawn to help our pieces develop. Of course in many situations in the opening pawn moves are adequete and even good. But if we don't know the theory or the opening at all and have a seemingly equal choice between pawn and piece move we should move the piece. Of course 1...c6 is totally fine and book but I am saying in general.
518,23,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So black plays the idea of countering the central control. Now white has many ways to play. In most openings we have the 3 goals to play for that I have mentioned in previous games. 1.Develop Minor pieces 2.Castle 3.connect rooks. Very rarely can you survive the opening if you do not accomplish 1 or 2 quickly. So we should do that before our opponent if we can.
519,23,3,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',We should use the knights to develop since they are the least active and usually go to only f3 or c3. But the Bd3 move has an idea to counter the development of the black's bad light squared bishop. Therefore it's the best move. By the way I know there are other options including the move 4.c4. But it is more thoery intensive and needs a deeper understanding of the specific ideas. 
520,23,4,Qc7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Now black plays a strange looking move. The best move was just 4...Nf6 to develop and prepare ...Bg4 with a decent game by black. The idea of black with this strange move is to cut off the dark squared bishop's Bf4 move. That would be the bishop's only useful square. However this move will run into some problems. So we met a new move that we don't know the theory to. Here is the approach---When there is a move we don't know the theory to we need to first always 1.Assess the move. The ...Qc7 brings out the queen prematurely. It could be punishable. 1a-If the move is strange looking or questionable then 2a-Find out the weaknesses it creates and just think about how you could possibly refute the idea that it has. The ...Qc7 idea tries to refute Bf4 and it weakens d5 control. We already see we can try to attack the pawn with 5.Nc3. That is how a candidate move can be generated from this. 3a-After coming up with moves that are attempting to refute the idea as well as sound moves catering to the opening goals and principles we use our thought process to pick the best one. The other step 1b-If the move looks fine then just don't take a whole lot of time. You can think about refutation shortly but just follow your main development process. It is only when the move is dangerous looking or more radical that we need to take it critically. Otherwise take a shorter amount of time like 2 or 3 minutes in 2 hour game.
521,23,5,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The move is the best since it plans to attack both d5 and Nb5Bf4. The move is different from the natural theory line of 5.c3 which was also an idea. But since black has played unorthodox move we can forget about our normal opening moves. 
522,23,6,e6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black needs to protect the pawn but he did it in the wrong way. 5...Nf6 developing the bad piece was best. Now the light squared bishop is locked and black has not gotten the knight out. 
523,23,7,Nb5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2ppp/4p3/1N1p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Although this moves the knight again it does so with tempo so it really loses no time at all and helps the develop the bishop to f4. Otherwise black could restrict the knight with move ...a6 when black although behind a lot in development holds the position due to a solid pawn structure that restricts the white pieces.
524,23,8,Bf4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2q1p3/1N1p4/3P1B2/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',White now generates the opening initiative and starts to force the black pieces onto the awkward looking squares. It was all by using the opening approach and finding the weaknesses of the black's strange move. The initiative gained means that our idea is successful.
525,23,9,Qe2,b'r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/n1q1p3/1N1p4/3P1B2/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',To hold the initiative we should make a constant stream of threats while making beneficial moves. By the rule of using the least active piece 8.Nf3 is best which also threatens Ne5. However this queen move is also quite natural for the queen and is also a good idea.
526,23,10,Nf6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/n1q1pn2/1N1p4/3P1B2/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',(?) This move is a quite bad one losing to a quite easy tactical maneuver. My opponents on the level 1800 USCF and above would usually never make such mistake so it was rather surprising. However the opening approach led to an initiative and the opponent is already struggling to find a way to clean it up. That is probably his reason for missing the move.
527,23,11,Nxa7,b'r1b1kb1r/Np3ppp/n1q1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Simple and clean winning a pawn for absolutely no compensation for black. As you see white's approach against an unorthodox play by black leads to a permanent advantage which is what we are trying to achieve. If you have looked at my previous games you can realize that white has now an advantage in both solid activity(material) and piece activity(position). By grabbing material you are securing a permanent advantage in activity really while the piece activity is much more fluid and dynamic. The main goal when one has an advantage in piece activity is to convert it to a permanent advantage or attack before it disappears.
528,23,12,Bd7,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2pn2/1N1p4/3P1B2/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Here I got a bit overconfident since I had such huge advantage in overall position. I made very natural looking move but turns out it allows black some counterplay. I really did not carefully examine the black response thinking that one variation would suffice to refute it but I was too hasty. 
529,23,13,1Nf3,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2pn2/1N1p4/3P1B2/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',(?)This move is quite inaccurate even though it follows all the principles. However to take real advantage of this move black must show a strong willpower as well as decent calculation abilities. He had the right idea but his calculation was probably not good enough to show him the line where he could stir things up. I was saved by that.
530,23,14,1Nh5,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2p3/1N1p3n/3P1B2/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',The best move but he needed to understand why to find the best continuation.
531,23,15,1Be5,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2p3/1N1pB2n/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',It's not the best move but it is the most testing idea. 12.Be3 Nb4 would give black a bit of compensation for his lost pawn in the form of counterplay against my queenside. If black plays properly I will likely be reduced to a small advantage in a complicated position.
532,23,16,1Nf6,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2pn2/1N1pB3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',(??)Showing a complete lack of will to counterattack white and a lot of timidity. Black had to counterattack even if he could not fully calculate the variations. 12...f6! was best even though it seems like 13.Ng5! refutes this idea. The natural capture of the bishop leads to a quick kill but the quiet 13...g6! 14.Nxh7 fxe5 15.Bxg6+ Kd8 16.Qxh5 Qxb5 with a complicated position. White may have an very small advantage but it is very tactical. I would be in a good position since tactics and calculation are my stronger points but he would have plenty of fighting chances there. I saw this variation and shook myself awake in the game vowing to not make another careless move. However my opponent thought for a long time and played this weak move 12...Nf6.
533,23,17,1a4,b'r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/nq2pn2/1N1pB3/P2P4/3B1N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq a3',The common mistake happens all the time by the way among class players. They understand the problem and can find the right ideas but then after a long think they play something ridiculous like 12...Nf6(It is the second best move but 12...f6 was the only move that black had to play to save his position). I think the reason is that they get scared by certain moves in the variations they calculate or they just think too much. When a position is complex and you have a choice that needs a lot of thought your intuition is often right. Of course calculate and think as much as you can but if you cannot find what the best move is just trust your chess intuition and instinct. Your instinct is the first move/idea that comes to mind when you look at a position. For example if black is to move in the position my instinct is 13...Be7 since I have yet to complete my development. 
534,23,18,1Be7,b'r3k2r/1p1bbppp/nq2pn2/1N1pB3/P2P4/3B1N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',And certainly black does play the move. He is getting ready to castle.
535,23,19,O-O,b'r4rk1/1p1bbppp/nq2pn2/1N1pB3/P2P4/3B1N2/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',It is certainly the best move but now comes a very important idea concerning planning: *Except in locked pawn structures after you have taken control of or successfully completed a plan on one area of the board you must transfer your attack onto another area and play on that area. The reason is that you are already dominating on one area-It will be hard to keep going and one area is not enough for a win usually. Also when you dominate an area there are usually no more targets there so you need a different area to target. The new attack will be easy since you are already winning on one area. By the way this great rule is the reason for many others like the principle or 2 weaknesses for example. 
536,23,20,1Ng5,b'r4rk1/1p1bbppp/nq2pn2/1N1pB1N1/P2P4/3B4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I have stabilized the center so black cannot play there and counter me. By the way I already had a concentration of pieces over by the kingside so no need to gather more force. The next step is to create threats which my move certainly does. White is ready to keep outplaying the opponent. My opponent makes a reasonable but weak move.
537,23,21,1g6,b'r4rk1/1p1bbp1p/nq2pnp1/1N1pB1N1/P2P4/3B4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',The reasoning behind the move is clear- the d3 bishop is just far too strong and threats to h7 must be stopped. But now the dark squares are weaker and the d3 bishop is still not totally out of the attack. Now white begins an assault on the king. 15...h6 16.Bxf6 wrecks the pawn structure in front of the kingside but there is no real good defense. Perhaps the best variation is 15...h6 16.Bxf6 gxf6 to keep the bishop pair although white still has continued his plan and has already made weaknesses on the kingside.
538,23,22,1Qf3,b'r4rk1/1p1bbp1p/nq2pnp1/1N1pB1N1/P2P4/3B1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',A solid move attacking and moving forward. Now black must play 16...Bxb5! 17.axb5 Nd7 when white still has a major advantage(due to a pawn up and more active pieces) but the kingside attack is repulsed. I will simply win by a positional grind and gain other advantages.
539,23,23,1Kg7,b'r4r2/1p1bbpkp/nq2pnp1/1N1pB1N1/P2P4/3B1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Of course my opponent obviously does not apply a safety check to most of his moves. On move 9 Nxa7 is a nice tactic putting the knight on the far edge of the board. Let's do the same to the other side! 
540,23,24,1Nxh7,b'r4r2/1p1bbpkN/nq2pnp1/1N1pB3/P2P4/3B1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Wins a second pawn and crushes the opponent. You can see that when you play good positionally the tactics just flow out of a position. When most players rated about B USCF play so many games that last 4+ hours end up totally drawn or a win for one side in the final stage of the endgame. These positions are usually closed or static. It proves the club players do not know how to plan very well or have a great positional understanding either. It is true: Most modern club players are weak positionally and the key to improvement is an increase in the understanding of chess. When one has a better positional understanding the need to calculate so many variations goes down. A simple realization of a plan in the middlegame in static or closed positions can lead to a clear advantage in just a couple of moves by the way. The better understanding you have of chess the easier it is to find good plans. It is the truth. Anyways this game is not really much planning since I won material by move 9 but it is still very important.
541,23,25,1Qxf6,b'r4r2/1p1b1p1k/nq2pQp1/1N1p4/P2P4/3B4/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now white is winning easily and with some help from the opponent...
542,23,26,1Nb4,b'r4r2/1p1b1p1k/1q2pQp1/1N1p4/Pn1P4/3B4/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',(??)Well it ends the game right away. Certainly white can win a third pawn with 20.Bxg6+ but there is far stronger move. It should not be too difficult to see.
543,23,27,2Ra3,b'r4r2/1p1b1p1k/1q2pQp1/1N1p4/Pn1P4/R2B4/1PP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',Tells the opponent that there is no more hope in the position and he resigns.
544,24,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all; this was a casual game played largely for practice. Probably the most critical thing of note in this game (besides the usual factors like activity and development) is staying aware of all moves--especially tricky ones like en passant captures. Enjoy!
545,24,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the Italian Game; similar to the Ruy Lopez but a little less aggressive.
546,24,2,Qe7,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',? The Queen defends f7 which was not really in serious danger but it blocks in Black's King's Bishop forcing him to either fianchetto it or move the Queen again. It's good to remember as well that in general terms bringing the Queen out so early tends to be a dangerous play.
547,24,3,d3,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4.Nc3 would have been fine here as well. White is simply continuing his logical development.
548,24,4,h6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqpp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is not bad but it also doesn't accomplish anything: 5.Bg5 was no threat and this move doesn't aid Black in his own development.
549,24,5,Be6,b'r3kbnr/ppp1qpp1/2npb2p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black finally gets a Bishop out though his kingside is still very restricted--his position is somewhat artificially cramped just because of the Queen sitting in the way of everything on e7. With Qd8 and Be7 instead with Nf6 to come next move Black's position would look worlds better.
550,24,6,Nd5,b'r3kbnr/ppp1qpp1/2npb2p/3Np3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White forces Black to respond to his actions instead of developing--the Queen has not done anything useful but it now becomes a liability.
551,24,7,Bxd5,b'r3kbnr/ppp1qpp1/2np3p/3bp3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',7...Qd7 was probably better freeing the DSB.
552,24,8,Qd7,b'r3kbnr/pppq1pp1/2np3p/3Bp3/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Again this probably should have been played last move.
553,24,9,Na5,b'r3kbnr/pppq1pp1/3p3p/n2Bp3/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',? This is an interesting idea but the Knight has no real prospects out here! The only place it can actually move is back to c6 and it doesn't threaten anything on a5. Black seems to be worried about the White Bd5 but a more direct way to deal with that is the simple clean way with 9...Nf6.
554,24,10,1b4,b'r3kbnr/pppq1pp1/3p3p/n2Bp3/1P2P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq b3',Black's awkward Knight gives white a chance to start a queenside pawn push with tempo. After 10...Nc6 11.b5! Black must retreat the Knight to d7 (or somewhere even more awkward) allowing White to win a pawn and prepare a formidable attack on the queenside: 11...Nce7 12.Bxb7 Rb8 13.Ba6 with pressure on a7 and Rb1 coming soon. Alternately Black can hold the b-pawn at the cost of further cramping his position with 11...Nd8 after which White can play 12.a4 or something else similarly dangerous.
555,24,11,1c6,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1pp1/2pp3p/n2Bp3/1P2P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?! This seems at first glance to solve Black's problem allowing him to exchange his Knight for the powerful White Bishop but White has a resource to get the better of the exchange...
556,24,12,Qh5,b'r3kbnr/pp4p1/2pp3p/P3p2q/4P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',? Simply put Black is making too many Queen moves. She's moved four times out of Black's twelve moves while the Knight and Bishop are still painfully inactive on the back rank. 12...Nf6 was a far better choice here looking towards ...d5.
557,24,13,1Rb1,b'r3kbnr/pp4p1/2pp3p/P3p2q/4P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',White intends to make use of his advanced a-pawn to blast a hole through Black's queenside defenses. Between White's Rook and Bishop the only defense is 13...Qf7 after which Black can play ...a6 and block White's advances while he gets his pieces developed.
558,24,14,1b5,b'r3kbnr/p5p1/2pp3p/Pp2p2q/4P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq b6',? This is probably an oversight--presumably meaning to lock out the a-pawn but this allows Black to capture on b6 en passant the strongest possible place for that pawn to go. Black's saving grace here is that White isn't very mobile on the queenside yet.
559,24,15,a6,b'r3kbnr/6p1/pPpp3p/4p2q/4P3/3PBN2/P1P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',?? This is the critical mistake in Black's game I think. It was looking bad but allowing White to roll his pawn unopposed down to the seventh rank means Black can no longer stop White from Queening with huge advantage: 15.b7 Rb8 16.Ba7 Rd8 17.b8=Q Rxb8 18.Rxb8+ etc. Black needed to play 14...axb6 here to stop the White attack from breaking through completely.
560,24,16,Be7,b'1r2k1nr/BP2b1p1/p1pp3p/4p2q/4P3/3P1N2/P1P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w k -',It's sort of a moot point now but this loses more material than Black needs to after 17.Bxb8 followed by Bxd6 and b8=Q. 16...Rd8 was better.
561,24,17,O-O,b'5rk1/1P2b1p1/p1pB1n1p/4p2q/4P3/3P1N2/P1P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Castling is all well and good but this comes far too late to be useful. Black is lost but there are a few more comments I'll make through the end.
562,24,18,2Nxe5,b'1R6/6pk/p1pB1n1p/4N2q/4P3/3P4/P1P2PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',As White doesn't have a clear mate yet he needs to trade down and let his other pieces get into the fight by threatening the BQ and preparing f2-f4.
563,24,19,2Qg5,b'1R6/6pk/p1pB1n1p/4N1q1/4P3/3P4/P1P2PPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Technically 23...Qxd1 holds longer.
564,24,20,2Rh8+,b'7R/6pk/p1pB1n1p/4N1q1/4P3/3P4/P1P2PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',I think 24.Nf7 Qh5 25.Rh8+ looks promising as well but this is an effective way to complete White's material advantage after 24...Kxh8 25.Nf7+ winning the Queen.
565,24,21,2Nf7+,b'7k/5Np1/p1pB1n1p/6q1/4P3/3P4/P1P2PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',1-0. Black has had enough. I hope you found something constructive about development and awareness to take from this game--more will be forthcoming! Thanks to chicoboy for the game and thank you for reading!
566,25,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White's move of 4.f3 was rather strange blocking out the square for the knight. 
567,25,1,Be7,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/1qnppn2/2p5/3PP3/2PBBP2/PP1Q2PP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Black is now solidly developing the pieces out and white has his center under some pressure. 
568,25,2,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/pp2bppp/1qnppn2/2p5/3PP3/2PBBP2/PP1QN1PP/RN3RK1 w - -',The purpose of this move is to give black a potentially useful move while waiting for the opponent to make a decision. Perhaps the best move for white here is 10.Na3-c4 with a slight edge. Since black has not made any strange or questionable moves he cannot be much worse.
569,25,3,1Qc2,b'r1br2k1/pp2bppp/1qnppn2/2p5/3PP3/2PBBP2/PPQ1N1PP/RN3RK1 b - -',White makes a rather strange looking move now. Instead of developing he places the queen again to another square that is not necessarily better. When your opponent makes a questionable looking move always understand what changes in the position because of it. Now black's activity will be faster and he will have a chance to blast the center with extra time that white wasted with this move.
570,25,4,1Bf2,b'r1br2k1/pp2bppp/1qnppn2/8/3pP3/2PB1P2/PPQ1NBPP/RN3RK1 b - -',White was afraid of 11.Nxd4 d5 probably with threat to now play ...Bc5 or ...e5. This move still adds pressure to the black position. It looks very strange placing another piece backwards and losing control of the center since the d4 pawn is no longer there. Therefore black plays the best move.
571,25,5,1d5,b'r1br2k1/pp2bppp/1qn1pn2/3p4/3pP3/2PB1P2/PPQ1NBPP/RN3RK1 w - -',Now black has at least equalized with plenty of activity. 
572,25,6,Bc5,b'r1b3k1/pp3ppp/1qn1pn2/2br4/3N4/2PB1P2/PPQ2BPP/RN3RK1 w - -',Black's pieces are very active while white's are a bit worse. Black should be better but white's next sequence made me do strange moves that lost the advantage.
573,25,7,Bxf2+,b'r1b3k1/pp3ppp/2q1pn2/3r4/8/2PB1P2/PPQN1bPP/R4RK1 w - -',Releasing the pressure is the first inaccurate move. Black should keep the bishops in contact since after the rook takes back the 2nd rank is well defended.
574,25,8,Qd7,b'r1b3k1/pp1q1ppp/4pn2/3r4/8/2PB1P2/PPQN1RPP/R5K1 w - -',This is a real mistake that overlooks a white next move. 
575,25,9,1Rd1,b'r1b3k1/pp1q1p2/4pp1p/3r4/8/2PB1P2/PPQ2RPP/3R2K1 b - -',Now black needs to stabilize the position and stop white from gaining a total control over the center. My defense over the next few moves are actually quite accurate and my opponent loses his advantage quickly. Defense is much more difficult than offense but I manage to do it. The key is to avoid all the concrete threats by the opponents and taking any spare time the opponent allows you to get your position together.
576,25,10,1b5,b'r1b3k1/p2q1p2/4pp1p/1p1r4/8/2PB1P2/PPQ2RPP/3R2K1 w - b6',Stops c4. 
577,25,11,2b3,b'r5k1/pb1q1p2/4pp1p/1p1r4/8/1PPB1P2/P1QR2PP/3R2K1 b - -',White plays too slowly and allows black to get a slightly worse position.
578,25,12,Rdd8,b'r2r2k1/pbq2p2/4pp1p/8/2B5/1P3P2/P1QR2PP/3R2K1 w - -',This move is rather passive but it does hold the center which is what black has aimed for. Therefore white has only a small advantage. My opponent not wanting a draw becomes rather frustrated with the fort not crumbling and loses most of his advantage. 24.Rd4! was strongest.
579,25,13,Qxd8,b'3q2k1/pb3p2/4pp1p/8/2B5/1P3P2/P1Q3PP/6K1 w - -',Black breathes a sigh of relief and now starts with a more aggressive plan to use my much superior endgame skills to outplay my opponent who had an almost winning position at one point in the middlegame. The following was a wonderfully instructive grind as I improve my position while white clearly has no idea what to do.
580,25,14,Qa5,b'6k1/pb3p2/4pp1p/q7/2B5/1P1Q1P2/P5PP/6K1 w - -',Exhanging queens is suicide for my winning chances and probably would lose due to the queenside majority white has that will give him distant passed pawn. Besides I am now playing to win. By the way here is a rather advanced rule about the endgame that most players don't understand- Endgames even those with equal material are certainly not drawish even if only 2 pieces are left. Some certainly are but most are not. Most people would assume a draw here which is totally wrong. If both sides play perfectly a draw of course but that is for any about equal position. Instead both sides have appropraite ways to improve and playing for a win is just as reasonable as in a typical middlegame position. Most players tend to think that equal endgames are draws. They are but not easily at all! Any equal position is technically drawn with best play but that requires both sides understand what they have to do. So I am playing to win here.
581,25,15,Qc3,b'8/pb3pk1/4pp1p/8/P1B5/1Pq2P2/4Q1PP/6K1 w - -',I will fix and neutralize my opponent's majority then will use my king to support an advance of my first kingside f pawn to fix the white weaknesses. Bd5 is a strong idea tightening the pressure on white because taking gives me a passed pawn in a queens only endgame.
582,25,16,f5,b'8/5pk1/4p2p/p2b1p2/P1B5/1Pq2PK1/4Q1PP/8 w - -',You see? Black has slowly improved the position but white has no idea of what he needs to do. To tell the truth it is not easy so therefore white should stay put and cover some weaknesses the best he can. The key in the endgame is that the stronger side pushes the pawns and the weaker side keeps the pawns at bay to cover weaknesses. The opponent does not understand this idea.
583,25,17,f4,b'8/5p2/4pk1p/p2b4/P1B2p2/1Pq2P1P/4QKP1/8 w - -',With his plan completed black has gained a continuous edge due to the space advantage and weaknesses on the kingside. White seals a blunder that ends up losing the game.
584,25,18,3g3,b'8/5p2/4pk1p/p2b4/P1B2p2/1Pq2PPP/4QK2/8 b - -',Terrible move. Now terrible weaknesses will be created. White is clearly worse so he should not help the opponent by advancing pawns and worsening his position. Let black do the work to try and gain something.
585,25,19,3Kxg3,b'8/5p2/4pk1p/p2b4/P1Bq4/1P3PKP/4Q3/8 b - -',??This move now loses the game by force by one tempo. The calculation is straightforward but black needs to make sure he does not miscount the pawn steps. The key is the the a and h passed pawns will stop each other when one promotes so the first one to do so wins.
586,25,20,4Kg3,b'8/5p2/4p2p/p3k3/P1P5/5PKP/8/8 b - -',A count shows that black wins by one turn.
587,25,21,Kxa4,b'8/5p2/4p2K/p7/k7/5P1P/8/8 w - -',Black's move a5 clearly was useful. White now gives up.
588,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! This is a recent miniature--in the Latvian Gambit; I know; you're shocked. It's another example of an interesting deviation in the Fraser Variation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5?! 3.Nxe5 Nc6?!) where we get into uncharted territory quickly and explore this strange line where White grabs an extra pawn and Black attempts to make him pay. In this case Black's spacious kingside and dramatic developmental advantage prove overwhelming with surprising swiftness. Some of the analysis is extremely long; I highly recommend using the interactive viewer since the one-page scrolling one doesn't display line breaks. Enjoy!
589,26,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The Latvian Gambit. Generally considered somewhat dubious Black gives up a pawn and generally much more in exchange for open lines of attack and a lead in development.
590,26,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the main line. I'm not going to spend much time on the opening variations; I have several other annotated games that go into the main lines in more depth.
591,26,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Standard is 3.Qf6 or 3.Nf6; the text is called the Fraser Variation and is an attempt to draw White off the main line. I've favored it recently especially because finding the time to develop this Knight otherwise can be tricky.
592,26,4,Qxf5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp3p/2n2nN1/5Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"?! I've encountered this a couple of times recently but I don't know of any theory that supports it or even mentions it. The standard move is 6.Qh3 or 6.Qh4 but the ""free"" f-pawn is tempting. It is also I think poisoned as it gives Black a strong initiative with which to regain his material while developing and chasing the WQ around the board."
593,26,5,Qg5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',? 7.Qf3 (...Bg4 8.Qb3) or 7.Qf4 are probably better as they don't invite the Black Rook onto the half-open g-file.
594,26,6,Rxg6,b'r1bqkb2/ppp4p/2n2nr1/3P2Q1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq -',The only reasonable move; anything else allows White to keep his Knight.
595,26,7,1Bd3,b'r1bqkb2/ppp1n2p/5nr1/3P4/8/3BQ3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',? 10.Nc3 or 10.Bc4 are probably better. This just makes developing harder.
596,26,8,1Nfxd5,b'r1bqkb2/ppp1n2p/6r1/3n4/8/3BQ3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',? This actually fails to 11.Bxg6+ hxg6. 10...Rxg2 was almost certainly better.
597,26,9,1Qf3,b'r1bqkb2/ppp1n2p/6r1/3n4/8/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',11.Bxg6+! was correct.
598,26,10,1Bg4,b'r2qkb2/ppp1n2p/6r1/3n4/6b1/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',? Continuing to not notice that Bxg6 is check Black chooses to set up a short combination meant to essentially finish development and prepare for castling with ...Bf5 and ...Qd7 while keeping the initiative and the powerful Rg6.
599,26,11,1Bxf5,b'r3kb2/pppqn2p/6r1/3n1B2/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',"After 14.Bxf5 Nxf5 I'm afraid my analysis goes too long for GK's annotation box so it will be split up over this move and the next. Look at Black's fantastic development compared to White's single piece off its home square (after 15...Nxf5). Materially the players are about even (with White having three pawns for a Knight) but positionally it's not even close. Black owns the entire center of the board and is ready to castle; White has many moves to go before his pieces can be brought to bear but he desperately needs the to weather the coming onslaught of Black forces.

As White has a free tempo here and a lot that he needs to get done I think it's worth taking a look at his needs and his options. First while Black doesn't have any immediate threats and may castle next move giving White another tempo to use it's worth noting that Black certainly isn't under any *pressure* to castle and may instead play something like 15...Bc5 15...Nd4 or 15...Re6+ or 15...Nh4. The first is probably not serious enough to warrant slacking in development; the second means that (A) 15.Na3 should be considered; the third should be seriously considered in all variations and the last should be able to be dealt with by 16.Rg1 or a preemptive (B) 15.g3. White's own goals should be to get castled and get his queenside developed as fast as possible. The main options along these lines are (C) 15.O-O (D) 15.d3 (E) 15.b3 and (F) 15.Nc3.

(A) 15.Na3 is a somewhat awkward developing move but it is also the best way to defend the vulnerable c2 square which could come under fire via ...Nb4 or ...Nd4 (note that White cannot win a Knight (unless 15.O-O) with 15...Nb4 16.Qe3+?? because of 16...Re6!). From a3 the Knight doesn't have much scope but it keeps the BQ off b5 and may jump up to c4 a little later. This is not bad at all though it means White would have to respond to 15...Re6+ by moving the King which is not ideal.

(B) 15.g3 is meant to protect h4 from a marauding Black Knight intent on winning the g-pawn with check. This is certainly a significant threat as playing some other move means that 15...Nh4 results in 16...Nxg2+ (or 16...Rxg2+ if White played 15.O-O) and an ugly situation for White. So *not* playing 15.g3 looks somewhat dangerous but what about the move itself? Well it offers no protection against 15...Re6+ which would force White to respond with a King move and loss of castling privileges--definitely a downside. 15.g3 also creates big weaknesses on f3 and h3 which cannot be shored up by a Bishop and does not contribute to White's development--both big concerns given that consolidation and motion have to be White's top priorities."
600,26,12,1Nxf5,b'r3kb2/pppq3p/6r1/3n1n2/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',"(C) 15.O-O looks okay at first glance as it gets the WK out of immediate danger allows the WQ to go back onto the e-file if desired avoids 15...Re6+ and develops the KR. However this also pins the g-pawn and Black has terrific mobility and all the open files he could want on the kingside. After 15...O-O-O he'll be threatening a devastating 16...Nh4! to which I don't see a satisfactory defense. To be frank I think White should be rushing to the queenside as the this move looks like castling into a firestorm.

(D) 15.d3 looks good at first glance: it allows the Bishop to move even allowing it to interpose against 15...Re6+ on e3. However there is a terrible flaw: it takes the d3 stop from the WQ making 15...Nd4! a devastating move. White's only choice is 16.Qd1 and then he has every single piece on their home squares sixteen moves into the game and the Bishop isn't even useful anymore again 16...Re6+ 17.Be3 Nxe3!. This seemingly-practical move then must not be played.

(E) 15.b3 is a decent choice though it suffers the same problems that 15.g3 does in that it does nothing about any of Black's threats. It does allow the Bishop to develop without the catastrophic effects of 15.d3 though and will allow an eventual long-hand castling once the WK is forced to move via Kd1-c1-b2-Rd1.

(F) 15.Nc3 has the fantastic effects of developing a piece making a claim on the center offering a trade and even being a reasonably adequate defense against all of Black's threats. For instance White can now respond to 15...Nh4 with 16.Qe2+!? (Re6 17.Ne4 Nf6 18.d3 etc) and similar defenses against 15...Re6+ and 15...Nd4. 15...Nxc3 16.dxc3 seems to be fine as well though White will still lose his ability to castle after 16...Nh4 but now Black's attack has lost a bit of steam and White should manage to hold. As the only move that can claim all this I certainly have to conclude that 15.Nc3 is White's best move under the circumstances."
601,26,13,1O-O,b'r3kb2/pppq3p/6r1/3n1n2/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b q -',? See the huge analysis in the two previous moves for why I think 15.Nc3 was the correct move here and why this one was particularly bad. Now if Black plays accurately White will have little or no time to get any of his other pieces activated for the defense of his King.
602,26,14,Nh4,b'2kr1b2/pppq3p/6r1/3n4/7n/5QP1/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RK1 w - -',"! No less brutal for the g3 push. Besides the obvious threat to the WQ a mating net is tightening around the WK with the threat of 17...Qh3 and 18...Qg2#. There are only two moves that fail to lose right away: the WQ must stay on the h1-a8 diagonal to defend g2 so White may play (A) 17.Qh1 or (B) 17.Qe4.

(A) 17.Qh1 looks SO ugly for White. It certainly defends g2 but it also leaves the WK with no moves which is a dangerous place to be with all this artillery bearing down. Black has a lot of choices here (truly he can do whatever he wants) but the main things to consider are in these categories: (i) bring more pieces to bear (ii) get the Queen to h3 and (iii) put a Knight on f4 threatening mate on h3 or e2.

(i) After 17.Qh1 putting more pressure on the White position seems like a solid plan. Specifically Black's Bishop could be more active either on h6 or c5. ...Bb4 is an option as well glaring at e1--where White wants to put a Rook soon--and may also capture a Nc3. So Bb4 may be strong in preparation for ...Nf4 since it indirectly defends e2. Bh6 does much the same in a different manner: it defends f4 directly so that White cannot eliminate the Knight there (17...Bh6 18.d3 Bxc1 19.Rxc1 Nf4 looks very good for Black). 17...Bc5 is not as clear but it suggests 18...Rf8 where White's f-pawn is hard to defend. These all look pretty good for Black with no obvious refutation.

(ii) 17.Qh1 Qh3 looks dangerous for White but after some consideration it's actually not terrible--the WQ literally *can't* move off the h1-a8 diagonal so ...Qg2 isn't a threat. The main benefit to 17...Qh3 seems to be that White can't play 18.h3 to give his King some breathing room and potentially slip out of the pin. It does give White some tempo to play d2-d3 or even d2-d4 and seems to require a following Bishop-move to really be effective. Despite how forceful this looks it seems to be more of a long-term goal and passive threat--the Queen is more useful on d7 where she has more options.

(iii) 17.Qh1 Nf4 is certainly the most forceful possibility. Black threatens immediate mate on e2 or h3 so there are exactly three possible moves for White: 18.Re1 18.Qe4 and 18.h3 (okay technically 18.Rd1 is not immediately fatal but it's inferior to 18.Re1). 18.Re1 looks potentially okay for a minute: 18...Nh3+ 19.Kf1 Qb5+ 20.Re2 (20.d3 Rxd3! and White is lost) 20...Re8 looks bad but maybe the WK can make it to the queenside. Note that gxh4?? remains impossible this whole time because of ...Rg1+ winning the WQ. Alternately 18.h3 seems to fall flat against 18...Nxh3+ 19.Kh2 Bd6! and 18.Qe4 is met by 18...Qg4 19.Kh1 Qg3 20.Re1 Nf3! 21.Qxf3 Rh6.

(B) 17.Qe4 looks to give Black a little less to work with. His Knight is now actually threatened and the strongest way to defend it seems to be 17...Qh3 allowing White a tempo for 18.d3 (or 18.d4) or 18.Nc3 so that after 18...Rg4 19.Qh1 at least White will be slightly better off with an extra move under his belt."
603,26,15,1Qh1,b'2kr1b2/pppq3p/6r1/3n4/7n/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RKQ b - -',? See above for variations; 17.Qe4 was better.
604,26,16,1Nf4,b'2kr1b2/pppq3p/6r1/8/5n1n/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB2RKQ w - -',"0-1. White's had enough. As I mentioned above White can maybe hold here with 18.Re1 but it's ugly and dangerous and Black's pieces are so much more energetic that the situation is probably hopeless realistically. I hope you enjoyed this brief game: exploring the results after 6.Qxf5?! is convincing me more and more that the initiative afforded Black in this line is simply too large an advantage for the pawn to be worth it.

Many thanks to mischo for the game! Any comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also let me know what I did well or need to improve. Thanks for reading!"
605,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! This is yet another game in the Latvian Gambit where I fall far behind in material as Black due to some very clever tactics on White's part and then scrap and stamp my way through the rest of the game. This game is as the title suggests a lesson in relentless aggressive activity. I recommend reading in the interactive viewer since there are a few long comments and the one-page scrolling layout doesn't show line breaks for whatever reason. Enjoy!
606,27,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The Latvian Gambit. I will not go over the opening lines in detail here; I annotated a series consisting of my first ten games with the opening here on GK so take a look at those for detailed explanation and examples of the opening lines.
607,27,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White declines (I don't think this is sound; better is accepting with 3.Nxe5 3.exf5 or delaying/offering a countergambit with 3.d4 or 3.Bc4). Again see my Latvian Gambit series for more detail.
608,27,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? I've come to think that this is too passive. I prefer 3...Nc6 or 3...Nf6 here allowing ...d7-d5 in one move later on and not trapping the DSB.
609,27,4,Ng5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4ppN1/4P3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+ while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB). 
610,27,5,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4ppN1/4P3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A somewhat passive waiting move. I think 6...O-O was probably safe here but Black wants to castle queenside if possible.
611,27,6,Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2np4/4ppN1/4n3/2NP4/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"?! The number of variations suddenly skyrockets with this sacrifice. Black wants to make use of his superior kingside space and preempt any White aggression so he breaks out this unlikely move. Let's take a look at some of the more likely variations:

First of all take stock of what the move did. Black captured a pawn and threatens both of White's Knights his DSB and his f2 pawn. Moreover he threatens to win the Ng5 outright. White has three ways to retake the Knight or he can play Bh5+. 

(A) White can play 8.dxe4 to which Black will respond 8...Bxg5 with a net gain of a pawn for Black. No dice.

(B) White can play 8.Ncxe4 and defend his g5 Knight to which the likely continuation is 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 O-O maintaining material equality and opening a lot of space on the kingside for both players. Alternately Black may opt for 8...h6?! in which case White has two options: 9.Nf3 fxe4 10.dxe4 O-O with a similar situation  as above but with the Knight blocking in the Be2 or 9.Nxd6+?! followed by 10.Nf3 with an unclear position.

(C) White can play 8.Ngxe4 which maintains equality after 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 (or 9.dxe4) ...O-O. This is similar to option B except it guarantees that Black can occupy the center with a Knight if he wants to (at least until Black decides to play ...d5).

(D) White may also choose to postpone the issue of the Ne4 with an intermediate check via 8.Bh5+ g6 at which point White must choose which of his various pieces to sacrifice and how noting that options A B and C remain on the table here but with the added complications posed by the Bishop."
612,27,7,g6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b2p/2np2p1/4ppNB/4n3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"Naturally White chose option D the most complex line by far. There is now a standing threat on every White minor piece but as Mikhail Tal once said ""They can only take them one at a time!"" Black has decent kingside space but also significant kingside weaknesses and White's pieces are posed to attack. The only question is: where?"
613,27,8,Nxh7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b2N/2np2p1/4pp1B/4n3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',! I like this the best out of the possible variations. White is now threatening 10.Bxg6+ Kd7 11.Bxf5+ Ke8 12.Qh5# if Black doesn't do something about it right away so something like 9...Nxc3 is off the table. Black has to eliminate one of the White minor pieces and as 9...gxh5 seems to lead logically into 10.Qxh5+ Kd7 11.Qxf5+ Ke8 12.Qxe4 and a loss for Black it seems Black must accept the lager material sacrifice in exchange for more activity.
614,27,9,Kf8,b'r1bq1k2/ppp1b2r/2np2B1/4pp2/4n3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Critically not blocking in the LSB.
615,27,10,Nf6,b'r1bq1k2/ppp1b2B/2np1n2/4pp2/8/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Seeking to trap the White Bishop which is not quite possible but at least this avoids more exchanges for now. Black needs as many active pieces as he can get. This also forestalls any threats of 12.Bh6+ Kf7 13.Qh5+ which would be a deadly combination without a Knight to defend against it.
616,27,11,Nd4,b'r1bq1k2/ppp1b3/3p1nB1/4pp2/3n4/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',White is preparing to retreat to h5 so Black sets up a combination to win back a pawn and isolate the d-pawn as a future target with 13.Bh5 Nxc2+ 14.Qxc2 Nxh5.
617,27,12,1Ne2,b'r1bq1k2/ppp1b3/3p1nB1/4pp2/3n4/3P4/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Squelching Black's intentions. Now 13...Nxc2+ 14.Qxc2 Kg6 15.Bxf5 Bxf5 leaves Black developed but badly behind and facing a huge pawn force on the kingside.
618,27,13,Kxg6,b'r1bq4/ppp1b3/3p1nk1/4pp2/3N4/3P4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',The Bishop is far too dangerous to live especially when the alternative is taking a Knight with a pawn that would become entirely indefensible. Black's strong center pawn chain is the only possible shelter for his King right now.
619,27,14,1Nb3,b'r1bq4/ppp1b3/3p1nk1/4pp2/8/1N1P4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',?! White apparently wants to head to the queenside or at least avoid locking himself up on the kingside but I think 15.Ne2 (with an eye to playing 16.f4 or 16.d4) was stronger here. On b3 this Knight has very few prospects.
620,27,15,1f4,b'r1bq4/ppp1b3/3p1nk1/4p3/5p2/1N1P4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Loosing the LSB and giving White's DSB some granite to chew on.
621,27,16,Bf5,b'r2q4/ppp1b3/3p1nk1/4pb2/5p2/1N1P3P/PPPB1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',Perhaps 16...Be6 or 16...Bd7 was better; Black is not looking for a center pawn break here. Besides trying to contain White's kingside mass he should be looking for queenside counterplay especially taking advantage of that misplaced Nb3 so 16...a5 is a good possibility as well.
622,27,17,1Qe2,b'r2q4/ppp1b3/3p1nk1/4pb2/5p2/1N1P3P/PPPBQPP1/R3K2R b KQ -',White prepares to castle connect his Rooks and take the kingside by force.
623,27,18,1a5,b'r2q4/1pp1b3/3p1nk1/p3pb2/5p2/1N1P3P/PPPBQPP1/R3K2R w KQ a6',Again I think this could have been played last turn but now that White is unequivocally positioned to castle long there's no sense delaying any further.
624,27,19,1g4,b'r2q4/1pp1b3/3p1nk1/p3pb2/5pP1/1N1P3P/PPPBQP2/R3K2R b KQ g3',?! This should have been supported first by castling and getting a Rook to g1. The reversal of the move order costs White an important tempo allowing Black to delay White's castling further thus keeping the QR out of play.
625,27,20,2Nc1,b'r2q4/1pp1b3/3p1nk1/4pb2/p7/3P2PP/PPPBQ3/R1N1K2R b KQ -',20.Na5 b6 21.Nc4 (or 21.Nc6 Qd7) ...b5 22.Na5 c5 looks a little dangerous (though I think it's probably better) so White chooses the safe route with this secure but awkward retreat.
626,27,21,2Qh8,b'r6q/1pp1b3/3p1nk1/4pb2/p7/3P2PP/PPPBQ3/R1N1K2R w KQ -',The BQ swings over to threaten h3 and generally help to defend the kingside in preparation for the queenside assault which will be conducted at long range by Black's Queen and Bishops behind a slow-moving wall of pawns.
627,27,22,2Nc3,b'r6q/1p2b3/2ppbnk1/4p3/p7/2NP2PP/PPPB2Q1/R3K2R b KQ -',Threatening Ne5 in an attempt to trade off the Black defenders and hurry to the endgame.
628,27,23,2d5,b'r6q/1p2b3/2p1bnk1/3pp3/p7/2NP2PP/PPPB2Q1/R3K2R w KQ -',Black's LSB is terrible but it can't be helped at the moment. It's also playing a critical role tying the White pieces to the defense of h3 (though as we'll see shortly it's pretty much just a bluff--if Black takes on h3 while the Rook is still there chances are he'd lose the Bishop before he could unpin it from his Queen).
629,27,24,b5,b'r6q/4b3/2p1bnk1/1p1pp3/p7/P1NP2PP/1PPB2Q1/R3K2R w KQ b6',!? Risky but I think probably necessary. Black *must* achieve queenside counterplay and he has no time to lose.
630,27,25,Bd6,b'r6q/8/2pbbnk1/1p1pp3/p7/P1NP2PP/1PPBQ3/R3K2R w KQ -',For Black every move is a cat-and-mouse game of keeping everything protected for just long enough to set up a combination counterstrike. The squares most important at the moment are e4 g4 and h5 though he has to be aware of the possibility of Qe3 followed by Qg5+. For White it's a question of making sure he'll actually be safe when he finally castles and brings his Queen's Rook into the game with deadly force.
631,27,26,2O-O-O,b'r6q/8/2pbbnk1/1p1pp3/p7/P1NP2PP/1PPBQ3/2KR3R b - -',"White has decided it's safe enough and stops beating about the bush. Note that Black's ""threat"" on h3 is revealed to be a sham: 26...Bxh3? 27.Qh2! and nothing can save Black's position. Black's actual options then are few: but the best one seems obvious."
632,27,27,2b4,b'r6q/8/2pbbnk1/3pp3/pp6/P1NP2PP/1PPBQ3/2KR3R w - -',The castle needs to be broken and the Knight needs to leave. Obviously leading with ...d4 would be disastrous as the Knight could comfortably relocate to e4 with unignorable threats to the Black King.
633,27,28,a3,b'r6q/8/2pbbnk1/3pp3/1P6/p1NP2PP/1PPBQ3/2KR3R w - -',! Recapturing with the Bishop doesn't accomplish what Black needs to accomplish and actually should lose in short order: 27...Bxb4? 28.Qxe5 Kf7 29.Rdf1! Remember Black's playing a game of keeping everything together *just long enough*. The pawn on e5 is still important and the goal is to break into White's castle which 27...a3 does splendidly.
634,27,29,2Nb1,b'7q/8/2pbbnk1/3pp3/1P6/r2P2PP/2PBQ3/1NKR3R b - -',This poor Knight has moved eight times only to end up back on its home square. From here Black has only a few options (29...Ra1 pinning the Knight 29...Ra2 looking to prevent the WK from gaining an escape square/defensive pawn shield through c2-c4) but after looking them over only one seems to be aggressive enough to force White to do something about it:
635,27,30,2Qa8,b'q7/8/2pbbnk1/3pp3/1P6/r2P2PP/2PBQ3/1NKR3R w - -',!? Let's not forget how this game started: Black exchanged material for aggression and tempo. No sense in changing the plan now! The Rook has done an admirable job tearing into the White castle but some risks are in order if Black is to hold on to the initiative and get the Queen back to the action while continuing to create threats.
636,27,31,3Nxa3,b'q7/8/2pbbnk1/3pp3/1P6/N2P2PP/2PBQ3/2KR3R b - -',"? I think this is a fatal--well not entirely fatal--mistake. White has an overwhelming material advantage already: all he needs to do is stop Black from rampaging for a turn or two and then blast onto the Kingside in full force. Taking this Knight guarantees Black at least a draw (see below) whereas all White must do to stall the Black assault is abandon his queenside castle and hide on d2. There are many sufficient possibilities but 30.c4 Ra1 31.Bc3 Qa3+ 32.Qb2 looks perfectly safe for example.

The text gives Black exactly what he wants: the White King all alone facing the Black Queen in a box when Black has the initiative. After 30...Qxa3+ 31.Kb1 d4 White has only one option to prevent mate on a2: 32.c4.

If Black is greedy and goes for a win with 32...dxc3 e.p. if White plays very accurately he might be able to escape with 33.Bxc3 Qxc3 32.Qb2 (I'm not going to analyze all the variations particularly deeply but 33.Bc1 does fail to a perpetual check after 33...Qxb4+ 34.Ka1 Qa4+ etc for instance).

However if Black is content with a draw (and he should be given the situation) he can force one very easily by jumping the Queen around between b3 a3 and a2 keeping the WK in check with no chance to interpose or escape."
637,27,32,3Bc1,b'8/8/2pbbnk1/4p3/1P1p4/q2P2PP/2P1Q3/1KBR3R b - -',?? White overlooks the main threat.
638,27,33,3Qa2#,b'8/8/2pbbnk1/4p3/1P1p4/3P2PP/q1P1Q3/1KBR3R w - -',"That's it! There were certainly mistakes made on both sides but hopefully you found this game as fun to read as I found it fun to play. It's certainly not often you see a King arrive on g6 on the fourteenth move and then remain unmolested for the rest of the game! This was a great demonstration I think of the importance and power of energetic play especially when significantly behind in material.

Thanks very much to aramberber for the games! This was a league match; the other game is worth a look as well in my opinion: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/braveheart?gm=45570 Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also let me know what I need to improve or what I did well. Thanks for reading!"

699,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual I like to begin with the King's Pawn Opening.
700,30,1,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq h6',I am not sure why she played this but I have seen this a couple of times.  Binblaster and Schakaterzie like to open with 1.a4 or 1...a4.  Although 1...a5 was not played this is very similar.
701,30,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',If she had responded with the King's Pawn Game or Siclian Defense (played 1...c5 or 1...e5) I would have responded with the King's Knight Opening or Open Siclian.  Therefore I would have played 2.Nf3 either way.  However she does something out of the ordinary but unlike my first game against binblaster I am not going to get overwhelmed this time.  As a result I decide to advance my g pawn so that I will have more options when developing my LSB.  In reality I am trying to fianchetto it.
702,30,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/4p2p/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',She responds with this move.  Personally I do not mind because it is very similar to the King's Pawn Game.
703,30,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/4p2p/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Before that happens I decide to develop my King's Knight as it is very similar to the King's Knight Opening.
704,30,5,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2p1/5p2/4p2p/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',At this point I do not know what she is thinking because this is not the Sicilian Defense.  Her plans however might be very dangerous and lead to a potential threat.  
705,30,6,Nh4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2p1/5p2/4p2p/4P2N/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',!! 4.d4 was an option but 3...d6 was not played.  Otherwise 3...d6 4.d4.  Then if 4...exd4 I sac that pawn so it becomes a true gambit.  Why?  I give it up to develop my DSB.  This move however is best and a Knight on the rim is dim in this case.  If 4...f5 my knight is not in danger she looses a piece if 4...f5? 5.Ng6 forking her rook and DSB.  That would win a free bishop at least.
706,30,7,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn1p1/5p2/4p2p/4P2N/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',!! She sees the threat and responds with this move because it is the only way to prevent a bishop and rook fork.  However there is a drawback.  In this position she has blocked three of her important pieces the DSB Queen and King.  
707,30,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn1p1/5p2/4p2p/4P2N/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',At this point I decide to develop my other knight because I want to develop all of them ASAP.  Afterall that is an important strategy in chess and it is where the principle of not touching your same piece comes in handy.  Right now I am trying to prevent her from stopping my development.
708,30,9,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn3/5p2/4p1pp/4P2N/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq g6',At this point she is sick of my knight so she decides to shoe it away.  I could take advantage with 6.Nf5 Nxf5 7.exf5? but I am not going to do this.  Why not and what makes it bad?  One time I witnessed this in a similar position and it weakened his position.  In fact it eventually led to his loosing blunder.  I would have doubled pawns.  Most importantly it would lead to a king exposure and that could become costly.

711,30,12,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pn3/2p2p2/4p2p/4P1pN/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Therefore I take advantage by developing my LSB.  As I had mentioned earlier I am trying to develop all of my pieces.
712,30,13,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2pn3/2p2p2/1p2p2p/4P1pN/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',"?! I originally thought that she was trying to develop her LSB but I learned that she is not later in the game.  If she was I would mark with a !.  Instead she just wants to attack my c3 knight but this is another ""wasted move"" because I will use a special tactic that is very difficult and complicated.  What am I trying to do in this position?  "

BTW cognition=mind behavior and it usually involves the thought process.  In this case I am specifically implying and alluding to thought process.  This is a different Scare Tactic that does not involve a check.  Right now I am attacking her pawn.  Now if 9...gxh3 10.Rxh4 and I look for plans to outsmart her.  However she does not play that.
714,30,15,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/p2pn3/2p2p2/4p2p/1p2P1pN/2N3PP/PPPP1PB1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Instead she attacks my knight with another pawn push but I will defend it.  In my opinion she is trying to outsmart me but that attempt will not work in this game.  Note: as some Class B and Class A players know I do not get fooled easily.  I usually know what my opponent is trying to do.  Afterall there are ways to determine your opponents attempts plans and strategies.  
715,30,16,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n3/2p2p2/3pp2p/Np2P1pN/6PP/PPPP1PB1/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',In the meantime she decides to attack my e4 pawn.  As I had alluded to earlier she is probably did this to scare and intimidate me in this game.  However I am not going to allow that.  Therefore I will not exchange my e4 pawn with her d5 pawn.  Instead I exchange my h3 pawn with her g4 pawn.  In my opinion that poses a bigger threat but I could be wrong.  If I am going correct however I am going to get rid of the threat immediately.  Note: I am not obsessed with or think about these types of threat due to my level of inexperience.  It is because I was taught to analyze the position and look out for the threats and disadvantages of each candidate move.
716,30,17,1f3,b'rn1qkb1r/p3n3/2p2p2/3pp2p/Np2P1bN/5PP1/PPPP2B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',You might think that I placed myself in danger by allowing her to attack my Queen.  However this was also part of my plan and it worked this time.  That is because of this move.  Something similar happened in a different game where I attacked the Queen.  However the opponent defended it and attacked my bishop in the same way and it significantly strengthened his position.  Therefore I decide to use the same strategy.
717,30,18,1Nc5,b'rn1qkb1r/p3n3/2p1bp2/2Npp2p/1p2P2N/5PP1/PPPP2B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',If I cannot take her LSB I have a different tactic.  What is it?  
718,30,19,1f4,b'rn1qkb1r/p3nb2/2p2p2/2Npp2p/1p2PP1N/6P1/PPPP2B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I decide to push another pawn.  Right now my goal is to force another exchange but that will not work.

Now I have another strategy but what is it?  I am trying to annoy her by alluring her to keep attacking the knight so that I can defend it in the same way.  If she gets annoyed enough it will anger her and that is what I am trying to do.  I want to make her angry because I know that getting angry is a way to loose a chess game.  If my plan works I will use it to my advantage.

I played this move because I thought that it was the only way to protect my hanging e4.  However I did not realize that my e4 was not hanging until a day later.  Something similar happened in my game against l-d-j during the end.  How is my e4 pawn protected?  In this position 16...Bxe4+?? is not feasible due to my LSB. 
723,30,24,1Bh6,b'rn2k2r/p3nb2/2p2p1b/3pp2p/Np1qPP1N/3P2P1/PPP3B1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now she decides to develop her DSB.  In addition she is also trying to develop her other pieces and castle but I have other plans before she can do that.  What are those plans?  
724,30,25,1c3,b'rn2k2r/p3nb2/2p2p1b/3pp2p/Np1qPP1N/2PP2P1/PP4B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I decide to fork her Queen and b4 pawn to win a pawn but it gets better.  How?
725,30,26,Qxa4,b'rn2k2r/p3nb2/2p2p1b/3pp2p/q3PP1N/2PP2P1/P5B1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?? She thinks that she has won a piece for her pawn but that is what I wanted her to think.  Afterall that happened in my game against l-d-j and I had to find another way to correct my mistake.  However I use this information to my advantage and it is not a mistake.  This time it is a deflective sacrifice instead of an error.  Now I am going to win her Queen due to this played move so this is her loosing blunder.  After I take the Queen I am going to ascertain that she is not able to correct her mistakes by winning back the Queen or the game.  For those that are wondering ascertain=to varify make certain or sure.  Afterall Jack Stockel illustrated and l-d-j has learned that it is not a good idea to underestimate your opponent even if you are winning.
726,30,27,d4,b'rn2k2r/p3nb2/2p2p1b/4p2p/Q2pPP1N/2PP2P1/P5B1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Right now she wants to force a pawn exchange and I do not mind because I am ahead.  In fact I would normally exchange but I have even better plans.  What are they?
727,30,28,2Qb4,b'rn2k2r/p3nb2/2p2p1b/4p2p/1Q1pPP1N/2PP2P1/P5B1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',At this point she must advance and sacrifice her knight or I am going to win her rook.
728,30,29,Rg8,b'r3k1r1/p1Q1nb2/2p2p1b/4p2p/3pPP1N/2PP2P1/P5B1/R1B1K2R w KQq -',She sees that my g3 pawn is hanging so she tries to take advantage by attacking it.  Once again I am not going to get anxious or be intimidated easily.  Therefore I am now planning a mating sequence against her so the game is officially lost for black at this point.
729,30,30,2Ba3,b'r3k1r1/p1Q1nb2/2p2p1b/4p2p/3pPP1N/B1PP2P1/P5B1/R3K2R b KQq -',This is why the game is lost.

731,30,32,2Qxc6+,b'r3k1r1/p4b2/2Q2pnb/4p2p/3pPP1N/B1PP2P1/P5B1/R3K2R b KQq -',Although her last move delayed me from mating her mate cannot be prevented any longer.  Having said that I take advantage by placing her in a very serious check.  First this check wins a free pawn in addition to what I have already won.  Second it takes away her opportunity to castle.  Note: Although she could not castle Kingside it was feasible to castle Queenside and connect her rooks.  That feasibility however is gone.  Most importantly it forks her King and Rook.  Therefore I am going to win her rook after she gets out of check.  This is just the beginning.
732,30,33,2Qxa8+,b'Q2k2r1/p4b2/5pnb/4p2p/3pPP1N/B1PP2P1/P5B1/R3K2R b KQ -',If you thought that was bad it gets much worse.  Now I am going to take another pawn and place her back in chess.  After that happens the most dramatic end comes so stay tuned.
733,30,34,Ke6,b'6r1/Q4b2/4kpnb/4p2p/3pPP1N/B1PP2P1/P5B1/R3K2R w KQ -',This is it.  At this point her LSB is now protected by the King so it is no longer feasible to take it.  Therefore I am trying to come up with other ways to place her in check and eventually mate.  However I now have a mate in one that I almost missed.  How can I mate in one?  By forking her K&N with my P and that is why this annotation is called the mating fork.  Afterall this is the fork that will mate her. 
734,30,35,2f5#,b'6r1/Q4b2/4kpnb/4pP1p/3pP2N/B1PP2P1/P5B1/R3K2R b KQ -',Before this game I knew the power of forks.  In other words I realized that forks could do significant damage and indirectly win a game.  However I had no idea that they could directly mate an opponent.  Having said that I learned the true value of forks from this game.
735,31,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Welcome to the next game in my Latvian Gambit series! This one like several of the others sees White declining the gambit pawns and taking a more passive route at the beginning. When Black finally sweetens the deal too much to pass up White takes too long to reorganize his forces and quickly succumbs to Black's superior mobility and aggressive potential. This is a quick one--enjoy!
736,31,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and frequently much more) in exchange for open lines on the kingside and a developmental lead.
737,31,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I really don't think White can safely decline the gambit at least not with a move as passive as this one but I've been seeing a lot of it. Black simply gains too much space. I believe 3.d4 is a far superior way to decline (or at least delay) leading to a very sharp game and potentially transposing to the Philidor counter-gambit.
738,31,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is basically a waiting move; finding a good time to develop this Knight is sometimes difficult and bringing it out right away simplifies things.
739,31,4,Bxc3+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4ppB1/4P3/P1bP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black cedes the bishop pair in exchange for doubling White's pawns and making queenside castling less attractive--after all Black intends to use his space on the kingside to start an attack there.
740,31,5,exf5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pPB1/8/P1PP1N2/2P2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',?! This is a strange time to take this pawn right after losing the ability to control d5 at all but perhaps White plans to assail d5 from c4.
741,31,6,g4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3ppPB1/6P1/P1PP1N2/2P2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ g3',?! White's castling options are now basically nonexistant but this may give Black some concerns about how to defend his kingside if White can mobilize another piece or two.
742,31,7,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3p1/2n2n1p/3ppPB1/6P1/P1PP1N2/2P2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ -',g4 is unguarded so Black wants to drive off the nasty Bishop and seize the initiative for himself. In the tactical situation developing kingside activity and initiative mean everything.
743,31,8,g5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp5/2n2n1p/3ppPp1/6PB/P1PP1N2/2P2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ g6',! In exchange for space and strong development Black offers White a far-advanced passed pawn right in front of his King comfortable that with White's LSB undeveloped there will be no way to make that pawn dangerous.
744,31,9,1Rg1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp5/2n2nPp/3pp2b/7B/P1PP1N1P/2P2P2/R2QKBR1 b Q -',This is the right place for this Rook in the long term but notice that it's not played aggressively--this is a purely defensive move meant only to support the overextended g-pawn for now.
745,31,10,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/ppp5/2nq1nPp/3pp2b/7B/P1PP1N1P/2P2P2/R2QKBR1 w Q -',Black unpins the Knight and connects the Rooks while bringing his Queen to a more centralized location. The threat of ...e4! is beginning to look serious with the White King trapped in the center.
746,31,11,1Be2,b'r4rk1/ppp5/2nq1nPp/3pp2b/7B/P1PP1N1P/2P1BP2/R2QK1R1 b Q -',This is the only feasible way to break the pin on the Nf3 but it doesn't do the WK any favors--he needs to get to the queenside.
747,31,12,1Rb1,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq1nPp/3pp2b/7B/P1PP1N1P/2P1BP2/1R1QK1R1 b - -',? This is the turning point in the game. White apparently underestimates the gravity of his situation and thinks he has a move to spare here but in games this sharp every tempo is precious. Trying for counterplay is good but b7 is entirely safe even if Black plays inaccurately with 15...Qxa3 (16.Rxb7? Qxc3+ and White is in trouble). White desperately needed to get his King off the e-file but now it is too late and there's no way out without significant material loss.
748,31,13,1e4,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq1nPp/3p3b/4p2B/P1PP1N1P/2P1BP2/1R1QK1R1 w - -',! White is now forced to capture on e4 and open up the e-file to Black's major pieces. The Knight can't very well run away as 16.Nd4? is answered by 16...exd3 17.cxd3 Nxd4 18.cxd4 Rxe2+ 19.Qxe2 Bxe2 20.Kxe2 Qxa3. The e-file will now open one way or another to Black's great benefit.
749,31,14,Nxe4,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq2Pp/3p3b/4n2B/P1P2N1P/2P1BP2/1R1QK1R1 w - -',Threatening ...Nxc3 where the Be2 will fall while the WQ scrambles to safety.
750,31,15,1Qd3,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq2Pp/3p3b/4n2B/P1PQ1N1P/2P1BP2/1R2K1R1 b - -',Insufficient but I don't see anything better. This loses at least a large exchange.
751,31,16,1Bxf3,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq2Pp/3p4/4n2B/P1PQ1b1P/2P1BP2/1R2K1R1 w - -',! And suddenly White is completely lost. Taking the Bishop looks bad because of the combinations resulting down the open e-file and more material loss is imminent but the best line I see without recapturing is 18.Bg3 Nxg3 19.Rxg3 Rxe2+ 20.Qxe2 Bxe2 21.Kxe2 which looks hopeless. So taking the Bishop is probably the best chance after all: 18.Bxf3 Nc5+ 19.Qe2 Rxe2+ 20.Bxe2 and Black will have no trouble.
752,31,17,1Qxf3,b'4rrk1/ppp5/2nq2Pp/3p4/4n2B/P1P2Q1P/2P1BP2/1R2K1R1 b - -',?? Not that it matters very much at this point but this move gives Black all the combinations he could want. Better was 18.Bxf3 (see above).
753,31,18,Qf4+,b'4r1k1/ppp5/2n3Pp/3p4/5q1B/P4B1P/2PK1P2/1R6 w - -',"0-1. Faced with the prospect of Black picking up yet another free piece with check White throws in the towel. Black's unchallenged center and White's one critical wasted tempo were all it took to give Black an unassailable initiative and unlimited attacking potential. Many thanks to latinoeh for the game!

814,35,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A good response defending the pawn and still threatening Black's pawn on e5. The normal move is 3.Nxe5 after which Black first plays 3...d6 to chase back the knight and after 4.Nf3 he can take the pawn on e4.
815,35,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now we have transposed into a simple four knights game.

The Ruy Lopez can also be called Spanish opening and because of the similarity with the Ruy Lopez this variation is called the Spanish four knights.
817,35,7,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is an agressive move. Black hopes to get a wild and interesting game very quickly. The bishop on b5 knight on f3 and pawn on c2 are all attacked but they are defended well for the moment. Meanwhile Black has a pawn hanging as well...
818,35,8,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',!? And White decides to take it. And if you don't see a problem with taking why not? Actually the move does not win a pawn since after my next move I will win it back but this move is not bad. More common however are 5.Ba4 and 5.Bc4. With those moves White tries to preserve his bishop pair which can be a strong force in open positions like this one.
819,35,9,Qe7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',With this move Black attacks White's knight on e5 and if it moves he will win the pawn on e4 back. The disadvantage is that he blocks his bishop on f8 in. Usually that is temporary so it's not such a big deal.
820,35,10,Nc4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/1B6/2NnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?? A perfectly natural reply but it gives away a piece. The most common move in this position is to defend the knight with 6.f4 and after 6...d6 move it to f3 after Which Black can exchange on b5 and win back the pawn on e4. Another possibility is 6.Nf3 which is also a good move.
821,35,11,a6,b'r1b1kb1r/1pppqppp/p4n2/1B6/2NnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The retreating route for the bishop was just blocked off and if it flees to a4 Black plays 7...b5 with a pawn fork. There is no way to save the piece.
822,35,12,O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/1pppqppp/p4n2/1B6/2NnP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',?! It's good to castle to get your king safe and develop your rook but in this case White should have waited. He can win a pawn for his piece by playing either 7.Ba4 b5 8.Bxb5 axb5 or 7.Bxa6 bxa6 (or 7...Rxa6). Now Black wins a full piece. When you know you're going to lose a piece you should try to win as much material as possible for it.

825,35,15,Nxe4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pppqppp/8/1p6/3nn3/2N1N3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?? I simply took the pawn but when I analyzed with my computer I discovered that this is actually a blunder as I will explain momentarily.
826,35,16,Nxe4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pppqppp/8/1p6/3nN3/4N3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',? Fortunately for me White didn't capitalize on my mistake. The move 9.Ned5! would have chased my queen away from the defence of my knight. After 9...Qc5 or 9...Qd8 White can simply take the knight with his c3 knight and after 9...Qe5 White can pile on the pressure on the knight by 10.Re1. I can try to defend with 10...f5 but after 11.d3 there are just too many attackers and my knight will eventually fall. The move played just leaves White a piece behind. It exchanges knight voluntarily and exchanging is usually not good when down in material but if he leaves the knight there I can exchange myself and 9.Nb1? is just a horrible place for the knight. After 9.Nxe4 Qxe4 White can try to develop while attacking the queen (developing with tempo) so I think that 9.Nxe4 is the second best move. But really the only good move is 9.Ned5. This goes to show that a 1700 like me can also make blundners and that you are not without a chance against them.
827,35,17,1d3,b'r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/8/1p6/3nq3/3PN3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! A very good move attacking the queen and giving the c1 bishop a diagonal to develop on. Especially when the knight on e3 has moved it has some nice squares to move to for example e3 or f4.
828,35,18,1Qg6,b'r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/6q1/1p6/3n4/3PN3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Retreating the queen while keeping an eye on the White kingside. I'm thinking of a kingside attack. I don't know how yet but  I thought a bishop on d6 could be nice. Another move which could possibly be a threat was ...Bh3 which is not possible now but could be played after moving the d-pawn. If the knight on e3 would not be there and I could put a bishop on h3 now I would be winning an exchange because I would be threatening mate on g2 and the only defence would be g3 which would allow ...Bxf1 Kxf1. These moves are potential threats to White and thus they are part of my plan. When I can execute them with good effect I will be totally winning so I'm going to try to be able to play them. Of course I also have to assess the probability that I can play my plan if it is an unrealistic plan it doesn't make sense to try to execute it of course. This is a good method of long-term planning which I use quite often.
829,35,19,1Nd5,b'r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/6q1/1p1N4/3n4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! Another good move by White. It attacks the c7 pawn and threatens a fork between my king on e8 and rook on a8. I have to defend the fork and there are four ways to do that 11...Kd8 11...Qc6 11...Qd6 and 11...Bd6. Those are the candidates I need to examine.
830,35,20,1Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/1ppp1ppp/3b2q1/1p1N4/3n4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I chose this move because it was part of my plan anyway and because it develops another piece. The disadvantage is that it blocks in the d-pawn so I can't play ...d6 to control the center and allow my bishop to develop but I had already foreseen that this wouldn't be a big problem since I can first chase the knight with ...c6 then retreat my bishop to c7 and then play ...d5. This was the way in which I was planning to execute my plan mentioned before.
831,35,21,1Re1+,b'r1b1k2r/1ppp1ppp/3b2q1/1p1N4/3n4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',A good move. This rook was not very active yet and is developed to an open file while forcing me to block the check. I have to either retreat a piece or move my king which would take away my castling possibility. You could call this 'developing with tempo' since White develops a piece and I'm not able to respond with a developing move as well.
832,35,22,1Ne6,b'r1b1k2r/1ppp1ppp/3bn1q1/1p1N4/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',This is the best choice. I did not want to move my king because that would take away my castling right as mentioned earlier and if I would play 12...Be7?? White could fork my king and rook with 13.Nxc7+. 12...Qe6?? would just throw away my queen.
833,35,23,1b3,b'r1b1k2r/1ppp1ppp/3bn1q1/1p1N4/8/1P1P4/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Trying to form a fianchetto but the bishop could already be developed (on e3). Therefore I think that this loses time because it was an unnecessary move. The fianchetto is a good idea in itself but the bishop is equally effective on e3 and the weakness of the dark squares on the queenside will play a role in the game later on (after the dark-squared bishop has gone).
834,35,24,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1ppp1ppp/3bn1q1/1p1N4/8/1P1P4/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Getting my king to safety and removing the pin on my knight.

837,35,27,1Bc7,b'r1b2rk1/1pbp1ppp/2p1n1q1/1p6/8/1PNP4/PBP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Continuing with the execution of my plan. I want to play ...d5 next. Notice that 4 of my 6 last moves (10...Qg6 11...Bd6 14...c6 and 15...Bc7) have been part of a general plan which I had already decided on at move 10.
838,35,28,1Ba3,b'r1b2rk1/1pbp1ppp/2p1n1q1/1p6/8/BPNP4/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',?? Unfortunately this is a big blunder because the bishop is unprotected. However I do like the idea that jkarp probably had in mind when he played this move. He wanted to force my rook to move either to the d-file where it is passive as well or to e8 where it walks into a pin. The pin is not devastating or anything but at least the knight on e6 is tied down and can't move so that my bishop on c8 is also blocked in (after I have played ...d5 it can still only develop to d7).
839,35,29,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/1pbp1ppp/2p1n1q1/1p6/8/BPNP4/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',?? Somehow I miss that the bishop is unprotected. Was it the open a-file which I'm not used to have or was it just a problem with my concentration? I don't know but of course I should just have played 16...Rxa3.

841,35,31,1Rb2,b'2b1r1k1/1pbp1ppp/2p1n1q1/1p6/8/rPNP4/PRP2PPP/3QR1K1 b - -',?! I don't know what this move accomplishes. The only thing I can see is that it protects the pawn on a2 but that pawn was already protected by the knight on c3. On b2 the rook has less room to manoeuver and White also walks into a pin.
842,35,32,1Qf6,b'2b1r1k1/1pbp1ppp/2p1nq2/1p6/8/rPNP4/PRP2PPP/3QR1K1 w - -',Now that the dark-squared bishop is gone the weakness of the dark squares on the queenside created by the move 13.b3 is starting to tell. Because there's no bishop which can protect them White has to block the diagonal with 19.d4.
843,35,33,1Qd2,b'2b1r1k1/1pbp1ppp/2p1nq2/1p6/8/rPNP4/PRPQ1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',?! This move is not very good. As I mentioned before 19.d4! was the best move in this position. It removes the attack of the queen on the knight and the rook. Of course I can't win that pawn for free because 19...Qxd4?? 20.Qxd4 Nxd4?? walks into the back rank mate 21.Rxe8#. After the move played Black can take advantage of the pin.
844,35,34,1Ba5,b'2b1r1k1/1p1p1ppp/2p1nq2/bp6/8/rPNP4/PRPQ1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',? I do not take advantage completely. With 19...Be5 I can win the knight because it can't be defended and it can't move as well due to the pin on the rook. White's best then according to the computer (and I agree) is 20.Ne4! (attacking the queen) after which I can play 20...Bxh2+! (sacrificing the bishop but winning the rook next turn) 21.Kxh2 Qxb2. I thought my move would work just as well but I missed a defence...
845,35,35,2b4,b'2b1r1k1/1p1p1ppp/2p1nq2/bp6/1P6/r1NP4/PRPQ1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',! ... which jkarp did find. Well done.
846,35,36,2Qxc3,b'2b1r1k1/1p1p1ppp/2p1n3/bp6/1P6/r1qP4/PRPQ1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I want to exchange and this move does force the exchange of queens but I could have gained a pawn with 20...Bxb4! (the bishop is going to be taken anyway) 21.Rxb4 Qxc3 22.Qxc3 Rxc3. It doesn't matter that much though because I'll win some pawns anyway.
847,35,37,Nc7,b'2b1r1k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/8/2rP4/PRP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Unpinning my knight and also forcing another exchange or else the rook has to go to a very passive square. Here we see that by threatening something (an exchange in this case which would not be good for White) I improve my position by force.
848,35,38,2Ra1,b'2b1r1k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/8/2rP4/PRP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',I guess 23.Rc1 was a bit more accurate because I would not be able to win the c-pawn as easily. It also contains a trap: if I want to get to the 2nd rank with my rook to attack White's pawns (23...Re2) White can chase my rook with 24.Kf1 and if I want to stay on the 2nd rank with 24...Rd2?? White traps my rook with 25.Ke1!. So instead I have to retreat at move 24 making 23...Re2 quite useless.
849,35,39,2Re2,b'2b3k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/8/2rP4/PRP1rPPP/R5K1 w - -',The 2nd rank (or 7th rank for White) is a great place to be for a rook (unless it can be chased away). That is because there are many pawns to attack (especially when they are still in their starting positions) and because it restricts the king to the 1st (8th) rank. Especially in an endgame this is very powerful.
850,35,40,2Kf1,b'2b3k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/8/2rP4/PRP1rPPP/R4K2 b - -',?! White could still protect his pawn with 24.Rc1.
851,35,41,2Rxc2,b'2b3k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/8/3P4/P1R1rPPP/R4K2 b - -',Another exchange but if White wanted to avoid it he had to move the b2 rook after which I could start picking up pawns with 25...Rxf2+ and then also the g2 h2 and a2 pawns can probably be taken. That's the power of a rook (or two rooks) on the 2nd (7th) rank. So I think this was the best choice for White.
852,35,42,2d4,b'2b3k1/1pnp1ppp/2p5/Pp6/3P4/8/P1r2PPP/R4K2 b - -',Probably wanting to block my advance on the queenside (because after 26...c5 27.dxc5 Rxc5 I have very weak pawns there).
853,35,43,2d5,b'2b3k1/1pn2ppp/2p5/Pp1p4/3P4/8/P1r2PPP/R4K2 w - d6',Finally giving my bishop some air to breathe (a diagonal to be developed on).
854,35,44,2Re1,b'2b3k1/1pn2ppp/2p5/Pp1p4/3P4/8/P1r2PPP/4RK2 b - -',!? Letting go of the a2 pawn but also setting a trap. I think this is an OK move probably it's hard to protect those pawns anyway and White has to play actively to even have some chance to draw this game..
855,35,45,2g6,b'2b3k1/1pn2p1p/2p3p1/Pp1p4/3P4/8/P1r2PPP/4RK2 w - -',?? A blunder but fortunately not fatal. I wanted to free my knight from his defensive duty (it has to defend e8 because of the back rank mate) but instead I allow a tactic for White.
856,35,46,2Re7,b'2b3k1/1pn1Rp1p/2p3p1/Pp1p4/3P4/8/P1r2PPP/5K2 b - -',!! And he seizes that chance immediately. A very good move because I can still not really move my knight: after (for example) 28...Ne6 White wins a bishop with 29.Re8+ Kg7 30.Rxc8. I thought I would trap the rook with 28...Ne6 and then 29...Kf8 but I had missed 29.Re8+.
857,35,47,2Bg4,b'6k1/1pn1Rp1p/2p3p1/Pp1p4/3P2b1/8/P1r2PPP/5K2 w - -',!? Instead I threaten mate (29.Rxc7?? Rc1#) knowing that a piece will be lost no matter what I do. 
858,35,48,2f3,b'6k1/1pn1Rp1p/2p3p1/Pp1p4/3P2b1/5P2/P1r3PP/5K2 b - -',! But of course White sees that. Now two of my pieces are under attack and I have to give up one of them.
859,35,49,2Bxf3,b'6k1/1pn1Rp1p/2p3p1/Pp1p4/3P4/5b2/P1r3PP/5K2 w - -',I choose to sacrifice the bishop because it isolates White's pawns on the kingside.
860,35,50,Ne6,b'6k1/1p2Rp1p/2p1n1p1/Pp1p4/3P4/5P2/P1r4P/5K2 w - -',I still had to move my knight out of danger and this was the most active spot. The b7 pawn could not be saved anyway.

866,35,56,3c5,b'6k1/R4p1p/P5p1/1ppp4/3n4/5P2/r6P/5K2 w - -',But this time I defend accurately and White decides to resign. He can get the pawn to a7 but no more: 34.Ra8+ Kg7 35.a7 Nc6 and the pawn will be captured after which my three connected passed pawns will decide the matter. Jkarp saw that I would be able to get an inevitable pawn promotion and therefore he resigned the game. Thanks to jkarp for playing this enjoyable game. I hope you have learned a lot from this game and I also did learn something: never underestimate your opponent always sstay concentrated even in a winning position. I think jkarp played a very good game and I really had to work for this win.

888,37,1,Bxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3B4/3pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Very intresting   it seems that Morphy sucrifies a bishop now but the black knight is pinned by the rook on e1  and after 7...Qxd5 will be 8.Nc3! and double attack on the queen on d5 and the knight on e4  and its impossible to take the knight on c3 because of apin on d4 pawn for example : 8...dxc3??.9.Qxd5 and the game is lost for black . there for by the mo9ve 8.Nc3-Qh5 wich we  will see next  white takes back  matirial with positional advantage . 
889,37,2,Be6,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/7q/3pN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',the whites threat was Nf6+ and the black queen is trapped there for black wishes to close the wide open e file to avoid open check by the white rook on e1 and black develops he's LSB at the same time  any way  my opinion that maybe 9...Be7 was better move with the idea of 10..0-0 as soon as possible . and for the reason of avoiding Ng5 in the future. 
890,37,3,Bb4,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/6Nq/1b1p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',another interesting move  10.Ndg5 !? pins the black LSB on e6 threats to take it on he's next move and win a pawn and by the way blacks d4 pawn is under attack . there for blacks plays 10...Bb4 with a tempo ( attacks the whit rook on e1 ) but Morphy finds a great way to advance hes advantage by another scarifies .
891,37,4,1Rxe6+,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2n1R3/6Nq/1b1p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ2K1 b kq -',butty  black must capture the rook on e6  and after 11...fxe .12. Nxe6 and black cant castle  there is double threat now  i mean the white knight on e6 threats double fork on g7 and c7 and force the black queen to retreat to f7 and defend those threats . but after.12. Nfg5 attacking the queen on f7  the expose black king  on the center  and white joins more pieces to the attack it seems that it is only matter of time until black recognize he's defeat .

900,38,2,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',(!?) The recommendation of Grandmaster S. Tarrasch.  Though 'positional' in intent can lead to interesting and sharp play such as the famous Max Lange Attack.  More often I play the sharper 4.Ng5 - 'A beginner's move' sneered Tarrasch but it leads again into some very wild country (though Black should shun the frumious Fried Liver [Fegatello] Attack).  I have a feeling White's best - certainly solidest - line is 4.d3 - the Bishop's Opening by transposition (1.e4 e5  2.Bc4 Nf6  3.d3 Nc6).
901,38,3,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White had a wide choice here: 5.Nxd4; 5.e5; 5.Qe2 being the main ones.  This ducks the King out of danger and offers a pawn that White hopes will lead to good things along the e-file for his rooks.
902,38,4,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2Bpn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Taking the bold line.  The move is OK but White attempt to exploit the open e-file.

904,38,6,dxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',(!) The right thing to do if Black had no reason to suppose White had suffiecient attack to balance the material invested.

906,38,8,Kxf7,b'r1bq1b1r/pppp1kpp/2n5/8/4n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Of course Black has to take the bishop pretty much as 7....Ke7  8.Qd5 and White is at lest level already.  But there is also no reason for Black to apprehend trouble is there?
907,38,9,Qd5+,b'r1bq1b1r/pppp1kpp/2n5/3Q4/4n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',At this it becomes apparent that White will get a piece back quite quickly and the Black King will be stuck in the centre.  In fact all the material given up has been in the interests of time.  White will now mobilise very very quickly.
908,38,10,Ke8,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n5/3Q4/4n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The only viable alternative was ...Kf6 and who would have the courage to play that?  This retreat is safest.
909,38,11,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n5/3Q4/4n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Obviously taking back the knight at once with the Queen would have been hopeless. Time is of the essence.  The knight can not run away and he's well and truly in the cross hairs.
910,38,12,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np4/3Q4/4n3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',(!?)  Probably already the key moment in Black's defence.  This pawn advance looks a reasonable and plausible defence and one that certainly came into consideration: to free the Q-side and to give the King a bolt-hole.  However the best defence seems to be 9...Qf6.  Even then though White gathers together his forces for a terrific attack: 9...Qf6  10.Bg5 Ne7  11.Rxe4 Qf7  12.Qd4 d5  13.Re5 (13.Rf4 comes into consideration too) ...Bf5 (...cxb2 or ...c5 are alternatives to think about)  14.Rae1  and White is attacking with everything he's got - and with apparently good prospects too.  It would appear then that the gambit has a lot going for it.
911,38,13,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p4/3Qn3/4R3/2p2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - -',(?) Not the best as White's attack just rolls over this 'beau chevalier'.    Nor would 10...Ne7 have been enough:  10...Ne7  11.Ng5! cxb2  12.Bxb2 Kd7 (White was threatening 13.Qf7ch Kd7  14.Ne6 Qe8  15.Qxe8ch Kxe8  16.Nxc7ch Kd8  17.Nxa8 winning the exchange.  Although the Knight looks imprisoned at a8 Black has only problematical chances of reeling in the catch.  The best defence then appears to be 10...Be7! but even then White keeps up the pressure by 11.Bg5! cxb2   12.Rae1 b1=Q  (an attempt to deflect White's pieces away from the main attack on the Black centre) 13.Rxb1 h6  (striking at the bishop to force an exchange)  14.Bxe7 Nxe7  15.Rbe1 (back again!).  At this point if 15...Kf8 White can [A] go in for a promising ending by 16.Rxe7 in which is active Q and N (compared with Black's undeveloped army) make up for a slight material deficit; or [B] continue the attack by 16.Qh5 (e.g. 16...g6  17.Qh4 g5  18.Nxg5!  Man White is sure lord having all the fun in this game!

Black's resources are quite stretched and it is very hard to find a credible defence.   So far Black has just the one piece developed and that an outpost knight about to be overrun.  All but one of White's pieces is in action already and the a1-Rook can be mobilised if required  in one move.

Nor was 11...Qd7 any use after 12.Nxe5 dxe5 (12...Qf5  13.Ng6ch Qxe4  14.Qxe4ch etc)  [A] 13.Rxe5ch Be7  14.Rxe7ch Qxe7  15.Bxe7 Kxe7  16.Re1ch Kf6  17.Qe5ch and if nothing better shows up pick up the c3-pawn (though White can probably begin weaving a mating net after 17...Kg6 18.h4 say).   The counterattack 11...c6 leads to 12.Rxe5ch Be7 (Running's no good as after 12...Kd7  13.Qe6ch Kc7  14.Bxd8ch wins Black's Q with check whereat White's Queen can make off.  And of course taking the rook allows Qxd8ch etc)   13.Rxe7ch Qxe7  14.Qd4 (a pause in White's attack!) 14...c5  (to deflect the WQs attention away from d6)  15.Qxc3 Qf7  16.Re1ch.  In this line though White is still down Rook for Knight and the first wave of his attack has been stemmed so active are his pieces compared with Black's that his chances must be the more favorable.

Black had the right idea - get the King out from under - but forgot about the bishop fork that White would play in response to this move.  13...Kf7 was correct but already White would have gained the advantage.  Now the end comes quickly.
916,38,18,1Qxd8,b'r1bQ4/ppp3pp/6k1/8/4R3/2p5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',1-0.  A game such as this does not prove anything one way or another about the virility of the Yurdansky Gambit after 7.Bxf7ch. The analysis is suggestive however that it is worth a try and Black's life on defence is not an easy one.  I recommend it to any developing players (including id=chicoboy) to try it for themselves.

In some positions a positional sacrifice can allow you to open up files and diagonals to benefit from and therefore a rook might be sacrificed for a bishop. In this game I believe that Black wants to give me the exchange in order to open up his game. That said I think the power of my bishop on f5 far outweighs that of the rook on c8 - it's vantage point allows it to pen in the e and f-pawns while blocking the king from getting to the 7th rank and watches over c8...
