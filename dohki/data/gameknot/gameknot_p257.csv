0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I played through an unrated game with my mentor Ionadowman and lost.  Here I was trying out the Vienna against him as this was an old opening and one which I thought I could try out on someone else if it worked out.  Maybe the choice of opening was OK but it was perhaps some injudicious piece placement in the middle game that cost me this game."
1,0,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',2. Nc3 - The Vienna Game - this move was popular with Austrians in the 18th/19th century - not played very often nowadays.
2,0,2,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',3. f4 - the main line of the Vienna.
3,0,3,d4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pP3/3Pn3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',6. d4 - deviating from the main line a little but this move used to be popular years ago.  It does have a drawback in that white's queenside pawn structure is about to be busted by a knight exchange on c3.
4,0,4,Qe2,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3pPb2/3Pn3/2NB1N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"8. Qe2?! - this seemed a reasonable choice from the database.  However thinking back it was time to break free from it.  8. Bd2 may well have been better as it would have avoided the bust up of the queenside pawns.  

Ion did have this to say in the Chat however - ""I don't think there's anything wrong with the 6.d4 line. I think you have to count on Black exchanging at c3 - he doesn't particularly want to but it's the best he's got probably. The pawn formation you get isn't really bad at all. It has its weaknesses (the isolated rook pawn the doubled c-pawn) but it has its upaide as well. The pawns are ""doubled towards the centre"" your centre is very strong on the dark squares and the e-pawn (in this game) remains mobile and hard to blockade effectively .""

Yes this choice may not have been fatal and it did have it's merits but it does not pay to make your task harder - this is the one case where following the database (I used the World Database here) is not always a good thing.

So when playing an Expert 350 points north of your rating - keep it simple!"
5,0,5,bxc3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3pPb2/3P4/2PB1N2/P1P1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',9. bxc3 - so here is the busted pawn structure.
6,0,6,1Be2,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/8/3pP3/2pP2b1/2P2N2/P1P1BQPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',12. Be2 - Frere Leblanc dodges the pawn attack on c4 and adds support to my queen knight.  I think I have developed reasonably up to here but I now start to go wrong.  I play 13. a4 to give my queen rook more scope as I felt he would be tied to defending the a pawn.  In retrospect I think again that 13. Bd2 was the better move.
7,0,7,Qa5,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/2n5/q2pP3/P1pP2b1/2P2N2/2P1BQPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',13. ............... Qa5! - Strong move threatening pawn on c3 and tying my pieces down to defend it.

""I formed the impression that early on your responded maybe too defensively to a number of casual shortrange threats - such as 14.Bb2. But that move wasn't fatal: in fact there were some lines in which you might have played Ba3 forcing the DSBs off or maybe attacking the f8-rook. """
9,0,9,1Ne1,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/2n5/q2pPb2/P1pP4/2P5/1BP1BQPP/R3NRK1 b - -',"15. Ne1?! - Ion had this to say about this move.

""But 15.Ne1 was definitely a surprise. I thought I had the better of it after that. I had anticipated something like 15.Nh4 Bxc2 with this possible continuation: 16.Nf5 Bxf5 17.Qxf5 Nxd4! 18.cxd4 Qd2 with a fork against both your bishops. Probably you would get one pawn back but you would probably have had to rely on a more active game for at least partial compensation for the other pawn deficit. 

Even after 15.Ne1 though I don't think you were out of it until 18.Qe2. That really was a mistake though an understandable one. The only other move was 18.Qg3 (Rxf1  19.Kxf1 Rf8  20.Ke2 after which I was still tossing up whether to bring the Q back to d8 (preparing ...Bh4) or the N (preparing ...Ne6). Had your K dived back into the corner (20.Kg1) then it was definitely going to be the Q-move (20...Qd8).""

Qb6  - strong move but I think Ion had a stronger move in Bc5  followed by the deadening Rf2 forcing Glenda to give up her life to try and save her other half.  A possible get out clause was mentioned in the post match analysis which I will reveal next turn.
14,0,14,Rf2,b'6k1/pp2b1pp/1q6/3pP3/P1p1p3/2P5/1BP1QrPP/R3N2K w - -',"22. ................... Rf2.  After this move I throw in the sponge thinking that I must give up Glenda to save Henry.  The initial material balance would be a R N for Q&P which does not sound too bad.  But I did analyse that black could win my knight with a series of queen and bishop checks.  However because Ion played Qb6  and not Bc5  I had the following get out clause as Ion states as follows:-

""Thanks for the game Joanne. Yes I thought your bishop might have gone the wrong way. I did think though that you might try 23.a5 Qc4 24.Ba3. I had planned 24...Rxe2 25.Bxc5 Bxc5 with 26...Bf2 to come though if 27.g3 Rf2 might be preferable.""

So if 21................ Bc5 !! I would not have had the get out move a5 to play as the pawn on a5 would have been blocked by The Wicked Witch of the West.

So here ends another lesson.  Even with a bad pawn structure try and counter-attack.  You may suffer an initial loss of material but you may stand a chance of regaining it if you keep your pieces active.

212,9,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Hi everyone!  I have been watching a very interesting game played by my mentor Ionadowman against a strong 1700  player.  Ion won this game by creating an imbalance through a brilliant counter sacrifice on h4 which caused his advanced pawns to break through to queen.  I really need to develop this part of my game.  The only time I have sacrificed material on gameknot is when I am already heavily up in material and I have done this to stamp out any remnants of counterplay by my opponent.  This is something altogether different.  I hope I can learn something from this.

Maybe there are possibilities of a kingside attack but black must be very watchful of action down The Fool's Mate Diagonal particularly from the enemy queen in the opening.

This formation is his favorite response to the English Opening. Having had some affinity with the Dutch Defence this is a very aggressive line. A good example of the way the game can develop is cormel vs ionadowman played a couple of years ago.

However it could be driven back by e4 which would put a cramping effect on white's game.  However Ion opts for clearing wood off the back rank first and preparing for castling with 5. ...............

Ion now develops his queen knight temporarily blocking in his lsb but I do not think his opponent can take advantage of this. I suppose if Ion plays Be6 before Nd7 then white can play his knight to g5 and if the bishop goes to f7 it will be swapped off.  Mind you in closed positions knights can be better than bishops.

Ion stated that this is the beginning of a strategic dichotomy: White bases his chances on Q-side play; Black aims directly at White's King. Both side have chances. Although I like Black's game I would have no objection to playing the White pieces in this sort of position.

Ion's queen will need to take her own pawns to get through here and that is illegal!!  Ion's king is looking just a little draughty but his opponent will not be able to take advantage of this.

Qxd5  - here we have it a queen fork on d5 but black can get out of it by moving the knight out of the firing line and blocking the queen check.  White is a piece for two pawns to the bad but his queen is eyeing up Ion's open castled position.  Another thing.  White has a well supported passer on e3.  On the whole I would say that black has a slight advantage here.

Suddenly all thoughts of direct mating attacks have gone caput.  The material balance remains the same but white has a healthy pawn majority on both sides of the board.  Remember if the material count stays the same with nearly all the pawns the major pieces and one set of minor pieces swapped off the game may well be drawn.  Note - king and minor piece cannot mate lone king 2 pawns are 2 potential queens which can quite easily mate a bare king.

Ion stated that ""Black's 34th came as a surprise even to me - and I played it! Fact is I was about to play something like 34...Ke7 and happened rather idly to glance at 34...Nxg3. Of course that move is quickly seen as hopeless but suddenly the alternate capture came to mind with the rook follow-up (as played). Clearly White's h-pawn cannot be protected Black establishes a mobile majority of his own on the K-flank and White has a possible skewer (...Rh1) to attend to. Such were the consequences of White's 34th move. The whole game is transformed. Good enough for me!""

Not only will white be a whole queen down but Old Matey is not far away.  Well played Ion!  - Joanne

Ion stated that ""Some more detailed annotation is called for in this sequence which contains errors on both sides. *A* At the beginning of this sequence 36.Bc3 is not a mistake exactly (the move protects the rook on a1) but White could have continued 36.Ba5 Rxh4 37.Rd1 Rh1  38.Kd2 Rh2 (38...Rxd1  is also possible) 39.Ke1 g3 40.fxg3 Re2  41.Kf1 Bf5! 42.Kg1 Rg2  43.Kh1 Be4! wins for Black. *B* Instead of 37.Kd1 White might have improved a little with 37.Rd1 Rh1  38.Kd2 but White does have this remarkable resource: 38...Rxd1  39.Kxd1 Bc2 !! If White takes 40.Kxc2 g3! is curtains but 40.Kd2 Bxa4 though it looks very good for Black keeps White in the game. *C* Black should have played (instead of 37...Rh1 ?!) 37...g3! 38.fxg3 Rh1  39.Kd2 Bb1!! and the f-pawn can't be stopped even after 40.Rxb1 Rxb1. *D* Finally White might have prolonged his resistance by 39.Bd4 or Be5 though 39...Rxe2  40.Kc3 Re2 is also winning for Black.

At the time of the resignation my rating was 1679 and my opponent's was 1348.  A sorry tale.

I will now tell you a little story about this game.  It is another OTB trip down memory lane. In 1997 I was the captain of the Cambridge City C Team although with my low rating I played on either boards 4 of 4 or 3 of 4.  All I asked of my team was that they just do their best and make sure they show up!  That evening a team-mate Romalt our top board player was taken ill and so could not play.  That meant I had to play on board 2 against a player rated much higher than myself.  Somehow though I did not mind being the under-dog.  One of my other team-mates got a draw and our team came away with 1 point out of 4 which at first sounds pretty poor but allowing for the fact that we each had to play one board higher than normal and we were one player short I think we acquitted ourselves reasonably well.  At the time Ian Webster was the highest rated player I had drawn against in a rated game so I was really chuffed at the time.  I did surpass this effort a few months later in the Roger Goldsmith Trophy by drawing against a player with a rating of 1560 - and he ended up being on the defending side!

I think a better defense would have been knight to c6. 
556,25,3,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3p1p/2ppbnp1/4p3/Q1P1P3/2NP1P2/PP4PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Not my favorite move because bishops like space and are usually best suited to later in the game early on its the knights that you should maneuver.

564,26,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',?  After ... dxe5 White is badly overextended (or ... Nb6 costing White the tempo).  Theory recommends Nf3 (the Modern Variation of Alekhine's Defense) or c4 continuing the chase.  Generally I'm opposed to bringing a Bishop out to c4 this early (blocks the c pawn) but that's mostly just me.
565,26,1,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/3P4/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Bb3 would hold the Knight a little better but e2 is not a bad place for him to be.  A little passive but it avoids the problems with a bad Queen exchange after 5. Bb3 dxe5.
566,26,2,Bxd1,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBBK1NR b KQkq -',An awkward position giving Black a lead in development but also something of a foregone conclusion after 4. Bc4.
567,26,3,Bf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/4P3/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',"? Now blocking the Knight in the ""g"" in favor of another passive development of the same Bishop.  Nf3 with a mind to castling seems preferrable; f4 may also have some promise (restoring White's claim to the center).  b3 could also be considered for its prophylactic effect on the Knight."
568,26,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/4P3/2n5/2N2B2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Good eye for development but at the cost of a pawn.  Bf4 is ugly but saves the pawn - for now.
569,26,5,1Nb5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/1N2n3/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Nice threat but with Black having the tempo you're open to a zwischenzung a la Nxf3.  Then you lose a Bishop for a Knight (I prefer Bishops because at three squares distant they can cover all of a Knight's forward motion) and Black is still free to guard c7.
570,26,6,1Na6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/n3p3/1N2n3/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',?  Awkward at best.  With Queens traded in Kd8 might not be all bad although Bd6 seems best to me (Nxd6 may cause problems but the ensuing cxd6 presents a formidable pawn center).
571,26,7,1Ne2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/n3p3/1N2n3/8/5B2/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',?  Bf4 was the correct answer here.  The Knight finds itself pinned against the weak c pawn and White is free to castle long into the open file.  Also removing the Night from g1 allows Nxf3 doubling and isolating the f and g pawns (and slowing your development although with each player already having attempted a lone Knight rush I don't think development was foremost in anyone's mind here).
572,26,8,1Ned4,b'r3kb1r/pppb1ppp/n3p3/1N6/3N4/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',?  Although it parries the immediate threat the Knight at d4 is neither secure nor does it solve the problem at c7.  Pieces in the center normally need to be attacking or one risks being overloaded.  a4 seems like a safer bet since Black now has an arsenal of potent responses - c5 e5 Bc4 O-O-O.
573,26,9,1Nxc7+,b'r3kb1r/ppNb1ppp/n7/4p3/3N4/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Winning some compensation.  A good answer to a bad situation.
574,26,10,1Nxc7,b'r3kb1r/ppnb1ppp/8/4p3/3N4/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',White is in a conundrum now having lost the Knight and being forced to retreat from the center because of the influence of the black Bishop.
575,26,11,1Nd2,b'r3kb1r/ppn2ppp/2b5/4p3/8/5P2/PPPN1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Using a tempo to defend a doubled pawn seems to me in this case a poor choice (especially since it also impedes the Bishop).  f4 doesn't save the pawn but it might get a good trade out of it - and develop that Bishop simultaneously.  It might also be time to accept the lost point and spin the wheel by doing something [seemingly] random like c4 Nc5 or O-O.
576,26,12,1a4,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2b5/1n2p3/P7/5P2/1PPN1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq a3',I would have ignored the attack and castled straightaway possibly allowing your King to guard the f pawns and definitely centering your Rooks.
577,26,13,1c3,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2b5/4p3/P2n4/2P2P2/1P1N1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',?  Missing the fork.  Black's attack also illustrates the problem with trying to defend doubled pawns while short on pieces: overwhelming attacks.
578,26,14,2b3,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2b5/4p3/P7/1PP2P2/3N1P1P/n1BK3R b kq -',"Not helping.  Not that there was much to be salvaged by now but for what it is worth Ne4 was probably best.  If the Bishop traded in for your Knight it would center a pawn and possibly allow your ""c"" Bishop to see some action."
579,26,15,2Ke1,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/P7/1NP2b2/5P1P/2B1K2R b kq -',Alekhine's Defense can get tricky very quickly since it seems like such a dumb idea that many players don't run into it often.  I don't really fault your lack of opening theory but always remember to develop a solid position rather than running after fleeting hopes.  Although the enemy Knight can be attacked don't do it if the attack damages the gradual maturing of your own position.  Although your pieces can be defended be willing to retreat if you are facing a substantial counterattack.  And above all grasp hold and defend the center with pieces!  Get your Knights out early and your Rooks centered.  And of course be ever hopeful - in this world you will have tribulation but we follow One who has overcome this world. [John 16:33]

690,32,18,d3,b'8/8/p5p1/P4p1p/2k2P1P/3p2P1/3K4/8 w - -',45. .......... d3 - over the last few moves white has had to go back back back.  Now white makes a mistake and plays 46. Kc1.  Kd1 would have prolonged the game but I would have manoeuvered Henry over to f3 and I would be able to clean up a couple of kingside pawns and crown the h pawn about 3 moves before white could crown his a pawn.  However ......
691,32,19,d2,b'8/8/p5p1/P4p1p/5P1P/2k3P1/3p4/3K4 w - -',47. ......... d2 - this brings about a white flag from my opponent as he is now deep in Zuggieland!  He has only 2 legal moves left g4 which is scuicide as either f or h pawn can simply take it and waltz through to queen or Ke2 allowing Kc2 and on the next turn kaboom Glenda reappears!  I am so relieved at the outcome of this game as I thought I was in a lot of trouble in the middlegame with a cramped position.  I still have a tendency to play passively which I am trying to correct but all the same my rating is now 1698 which is now the highest it has ever been on gameknot and I only need one more win or high draw to push me over the 1700 frontier!

This is usually one of the first openings that beginners are taken through because it is an example of where the minor pieces should usually go.

According to chessops database this position is deemed to be equal.  Both kings now get tucked away on the kingside.

White never seemed to get much attack once the f-pawn went. Probably he would have been better off protecting that pawn (31...Rd1  32.Kh2 Rd2 33.f3 Rxb2 whereupon White just rounds up Black's a-pawn). Then Black would have had to defend on both sides of the board. ""

A vital move here - holds up the advance of the h pawn and Henry can now sandwich himself neatly between the two doubletons on the g file should we have a white passer on a7 to contend with.  It is essential that the white rook will not be able to check Henry in order to get a queen.  It also brings my g pawn a little closer to g1.  This will become a factor later on.

It seems incredible but should the white king try and come to the aid of the a pawn the black rook will clean up the white g and h pawn.  Incredibly the g pawn will crown first!  I offered the draw and Paul accepted.  What a relief after being in such a dire position in the middlegame and a pawn minus to the bargain!

This is Cambridge City Chess Club playing against the ICI Sheepdogs in a place called Stowmarket somewhere in Suffolk United Kingdom.  I was on board 4 of 4 in that match.  I had to do the driving so it was very nice to drive home after what happened in this match.

779,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',i am sure on the name of this opening i bet someone will tell me it eventually but it was smooth sailing. i was goin for a king bishops gambit my favorite set up but i was forced to do it solo.
