12,1,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Another game in my Ruy Lopez tournament another strong player matchup.  Krewals' rating was still provisional when I played him but it has since gelled in the strong mid-1800s range.  I didn't doubt it looking over the sharp sorties he'd thrust and parried thus far or was still fencing. 
13,1,1,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The most common moves thus far.  I wasn't using a database however just an ancient copy of I. A. Horowitz's Chess Openings: Theory and Practice a free account on www.chessgames.com with limited resources and my own chess sense.  The point of this tournament was to familiarize myself a little more with the Spanish Opening.
14,1,2,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',I've found that this early ...b5 maneuver (usually wedded with ...Bc5) is far more common at least in my patchy experience on the white side of the Ruy then the mainline Ruy 5. ...Be7 or 5. ...Nxe5 the two theoretically stamped continuations.
15,1,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A sort of Ruy Lopez Classical Deferred.  I think the ...Bc5 maneuver appeals more to sub-master players because it's more active on the g1-a7 diagonal vis-a-vis the e7 post.  This treatment by the second player always seemed to me a distinctly old-fashioned treatment of the Ruy even a little arrogant.
16,1,4,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1N3/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"So taking advantage of the ""Fork Trick"" more often found in Open games I try to refute it outright.  A bit of hubris but Nosferatu used to lead legions that slew entire villages of Turks and lived in Orientalist splendor in old Hungary before living in his ruinous cave so I'm prone to old habits.  I learned later this is regarded only as a sideline to the more ""correct"" 7. a4 and 7. c3."
17,1,5,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/2ppqppp/p4n2/1p2n3/3QP3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',"I learned later from my pet rodent made from steel and alkaline blood that this was the last ""book move"" and 9. ...d6 and 9. ...Nc6 are preferred.  I saw nothing wrong with this move; it covers e5 and prepares a ...c5 advance that can snare my bishop if I'm asleep."
18,1,6,1Bf4,b'r1b1k2r/2ppqppp/p4n2/1p2n3/3QPB2/1B6/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',I also considered the space-gaining 10. f4 though I didn't quite trust it fearing overextension of my center and collapse since my queenside pieces are resting on their laurels.  There's no reason not to however.  10. f4 is quite sound and the most testing gaining central space but I think Nosferatu was still leaping at turkish phantoms in my mind.
19,1,7,1d6,b'r1b1k2r/2p1qppp/p2p1n2/1p2n3/3QPB2/1B6/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',White's opening plan has pretty much been a wash which I suppose is why 7. Nxe5 is regarded as too optimistic.  Black has now equalized.
20,1,8,1Bd5,b'r1b1k2r/2p1qppp/p2p1n2/1p1Bn3/3QPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Anticipating ...c5.  Shepherding this bishop is proving to be a nuisance at any rate and I was happy to exchange it.

23,1,11,1Na3,b'r4rk1/4qppp/3p4/1ppPnb2/5B2/N3Q3/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Developing my last piece and eying b5 and well as a c4 support point if black plays ...b4 since black's knight is pinned against his queen for the time being.
24,1,12,1Bxe5,b'r4rk1/4q1pp/3p1p2/1ppPBb2/8/N3Q3/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',My main alternative was 17. c4 b4 18. Nb5 but I didn't quite like my knight being stuck there having no other square safe square to leap to and easy to pressure with moves like ...Bd7 and ...Rfb8.  I also didn't like 17. Nxb5 Bxc7 because I thought my b-pawn would also end up as a target.  I chose the text (besides the above considerations) because I didn't see my DSB doing very much especially after black shored up things with 16. ...f6.
25,1,13,1f4,b'r4rk1/4q1pp/3p4/1ppPpb2/5P2/N3Q3/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - f3',Trying to generate some play against the same pinned e5 square.
26,1,14,e4,b'r4rk1/4q1pp/3p4/2pP1b2/1pN1pP2/4Q3/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black does get a passed pawn through this move sequence but I figured I had to live with it to unbalance the position a wee bit.  On the upside it does stunt the enemy bishop's range along the b1-h7 diagonal and could potentially be a target for me to focus on. I do posees an f-pawn while black doesn't if I get a chance to advance it in the future.
27,1,15,Rfb8,b'rr4k1/4q1pp/3p4/2pP1b2/2N1pP2/2P1Q3/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black grabs the other open file while we stand off on the a-file neither one of us wishing to capitulate it.
28,1,16,2Na5,b'rr4k1/4q1pp/3p4/N1pP1b2/4pP2/2P1Q3/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',Heading to what I hope will be a nice spot for the knight to nest on c6.
29,1,17,Rxa1,b'1r2q1k1/6pp/2Np4/2pP1b2/4pP2/2P1Q3/6PP/r4RK1 w - -',Black swaps off one seige engine in order to free up its brother to infiltrate my second rank.
30,1,18,Rb2,b'4q1k1/6pp/2Np4/2pP1b2/4pP2/2P1Q3/1r4PP/R5K1 w - -',Of course my own parallel path with Ra1-a7 is now open to nag the enemy king with similar pressures.
31,1,19,2h3,b'4q1k1/6pp/2Np4/2pP1b2/4pP2/2P1Q2P/1r4P1/R5K1 b - -',But first; time out for luft.

33,1,21,2Ra7,b'4q1k1/R5p1/2Np4/2pP1b1p/4pP2/2P1Q2P/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',The white rook working in tandem with the knight behind the scenes can harass black a little more effectively than black's rook with the bishop.  Black needs to continually monitor the e7 square.
34,1,22,2Bd7,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP3p/4pP2/2P1Q2P/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',So black cuts off my rook's access.
35,1,23,2f5,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1P1p/4p3/2P1Q2P/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',! However the f-pawn is now allowed to spring to life and give my queen a route to the black kingside with ideas of my own mating threats.
36,1,24,2Kf2,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1P1p/4p3/2P1Q2P/5KP1/1r6 b - -',?! I was about to move 28. Kh2 but then to my horror I found a way for black to win my queen: 28. Kh2 Bxc6 29. dxc6 Qe5ch 30. Qg3 Rh1ch 31. Kxh8 Qxg3.  Here I stopped analyzing but the joke is on black (or perhaps Nosferatu who missed it) after all since after 32. c7 (remember this brave infantryman?) I can simply promote a queen as there is no move black can make to cover the c8 square.  Not seeing this I figured 28. Kf2 was forced.  After 28. Kh2 black has many more ways to go wrong than white.
37,1,25,2h4,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1P2/4p2p/2P1Q2P/5KP1/1r6 w - -',Covering any other hatch-escape by the white king via g3.
38,1,26,2Qg5,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1PQ1/4p2p/2P4P/5KP1/1r6 b - -',Now the black bishop is pinned by the mate threat on g7 and I have f6 in the works.
39,1,27,2e3+,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1PQ1/7p/2P1p2P/5KP1/1r6 w - -',! I saw that after 30. Qxe3?? Rf1ch wins for the second player.  Nothing to do but continue to draw my king out into the center as a blockade.  Luckily his other pieces the bishop & queen are too awkwardly placed to take advantage of this.
40,1,28,3Ke1,b'4q1k1/R2b2p1/2Np4/2pP1PQ1/7p/2P1p2P/1r4P1/4K3 b - -',Black's e-pawn is protected by the queen as well as passed so moving to f1 or d1 and facing ...e2ch is out of the question.
41,1,29,3f6,b'4qk2/R2b2p1/2Np1P2/2pP2Q1/7p/2P1p2P/1r4P1/4K3 b - -',Threatening mate and the black queen cannot leave the back-rank due to Ra8ch so:
42,1,30,3Rb1+,b'4qk2/R2b2p1/2Np1P2/2pP2Q1/7p/2P1p2P/6P1/1r2K3 w - -',Black resorts to his perpetual.  The King's only squares are literally e1 and e2.  Trying to escape via f3 or d3 leads to mate the former immediately on f2 the later through a long forcing sequence using the queen & rook.  I didn't analyze to mate but knew intuitively it'd lead to it or at least catastrophic material loss so a draw was agreed.  A nice positional bout of parry and thrust with the main gauche and rapier.

White is only up one pawn at this moment but it will be easier to trade rooks from here.  Every even exchange makes white's one pawn more valuable.  Finally black's queen is really boxed in as well.  Qd7 is blocked by Nb6+.  Black will have to spend several moves getting material off the back row--moves white will exploit taking pawns or setting up other costly trades.

On one hand there is some very good thinking behind this move – you're seizing more influence in the center and releasing your DSB.

It's important to have a plan even (especially?) when you've got a big advantage. I realize you were probably short of time but planning will (in the long run) actually help you move better faster. 
Here a sample plan could be to try and create a passed pawn while exchanging pieces and then push that passed pawn to the end of the board. …Rd8 targeting the d-pawn would be a good start plus it'd win a pawn. (Rd1? Nxe4! 26. Nxe4 Bxe4 27. dxe4 Rxd1+ – using a pin) Once the d-pawn is out the c-pawn can be pushed all the way."

You need to train yourself to always ask the question ""what am I trying to accomplish?""

(Your opponent missed it but Kd2 would have made it more complicated. Still White was totally lost to begin with and the resignation is overdue.)
It's fitting that after you had ridden your tactical skills so hard to an overwhelming position you would again finish off with a tactic. Thing is your opponents won't always drop opportunities like this into your lap. You need to learn to ""make your own luck"" – to plan and strategize so that you are constantly improving your position on your own initiative instead of waiting for stronger opponents to beat you and for weaker opponents to fold."

After my missed opportunity against the 1950+ player Paolo I did manage to win this one although this time it was against a fellow Class B player.  He played the Kiezeritzky Variation of the King's Gambit accepted and fell into an inferior line.  My pieces just overwhelmed him and that did result in me winning a rook.  My opponent made me prove the win right out till he copped Old Matey.  Here is an analysis of the game:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15157320&fb=1&rnd=0.2663012340368604"
275,11,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ..... fxe4 - this is the King's Gambit accepted.  White chooses to sac a pawn and build up a strong pawn centre and an attack on the BK.  But Black can defend and even counter-attack as you will see.
276,11,2,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Ne5 - this is the Kiezeritzky Variation.  An alternative is the Allgaier Gambit which is Ng5 where the knight is sacrificed for two pawns to expose the BK in my case my seafood-loving king Henry!
277,11,3,Bh4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/4PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',7. ...... Bh4+ - Fou Lenoir comes into the fray.  In order to avoid displacing his king white must retreat his knight to f2.
278,11,4,Bg3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/4Pp2/6b1/PPPP1NP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',8. .... Bg3 - gameknot analysis does not like this move.  It was one of the recommended moves in the DB and it does form a bit of a clamp over the white position.
279,11,5,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3p1n2/7P/3PPp2/6b1/PPP2NP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',9. ...... Nf6! - this developing move has a sinister purpose.  The e4 pawn is under threat and I am also threatening Ng4 taking advantage of the pin on the f2 knight.
280,11,6,1Qf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/3PPpn1/2N2Qb1/PPP2NP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',11. Qf3 - The Wicked Witch of the West tries to defend.  Trouble is she is worth 9 material points so alas the knight is very poorly defended.  Here gameknot analysis suggested BxN+ but I thought that NxN threatening the rook on h1 was stronger.
281,11,7,1Qxg3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/3PP3/2N3Q1/PPP3P1/R3KB2 b Qkq -',14. Qxg3 - after all this I am a R for P up.  I am very behind on development however and Henry is looking a little draughty!  However before attending to my queenside Henry bravely ambles onto f8 to stop Qg7.
282,11,8,Rg8,b'rnbq1kr1/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/3PP3/2N3Q1/PPP3P1/2KR1B2 w - -',15. ..... Rg8 - my extra rook takes control of the g file and the Witch being of a higher unit value than the rook must move off the g file.
283,11,9,1Qf4,b'rnbq1kr1/ppp2p1p/3p4/7P/3PPQ2/2N5/PPP3P1/2KR1B2 b - -',16. Qf4 - ah goody I can force a trade of queens here.  As I am still 4 points up in material exchanging queens will be a step nearer to victory as I will have squeezed any juice of counterplay out of my opponent.
284,11,10,Na6,b'r1b2k2/ppp2p1p/n2p4/3N2rP/3PP3/8/PPP3P1/2KR1B2 w - -',18. ...... Na6 - a developing move and a necessary one as white threatens to regain his rook.
285,11,11,bxa6,b'r1b2k2/p1p2p1p/p2p4/3N2rP/3PP3/8/PPP3P1/2KR4 w - -',19. ..... bxa6 - doubled shattered pawns still no matter.  That's another set of pieces off the board.  Remember an extra rook (K + R v bare K) is enough to force checkmate in the endgame.
286,11,12,Rxg2,b'1rb2k2/p1N2p1p/p2p4/7P/3PP3/8/PPP3r1/2K4R w - -',21. ....... Rxg2 - I am still 4 points up in material and have a rook on the 7th rank. This is looking really nasty for my opponent.
287,11,13,2e5,b'1r6/pb3pkp/p2p1N2/4P2P/3P4/8/PPP3r1/2K4R b - -',24. e5 - white is not giving up however he is determined to get a passed pawn out of this.  However a tactical shot forces white to trade off his remaining rook.
288,11,14,Bxh1,b'1r6/p4pkp/p2p1N2/4P2P/3P4/8/PPK5/7b w - -',25. ..... Bxh1 - Like this.   Fou Leblanc swoops down on the long diagonal to read the last rites to the enemy white rook on h1.
289,11,15,2exd6,b'1r6/p4p1p/p2P1N1k/8/3P4/8/PPK5/7b b - -',27. exd6 - my opponent has got his passer but he is now a full rook down and the passer is easily contained.
290,11,16,Bxd7,b'3r4/p2b1pkp/p7/8/3P4/4N3/PPK5/8 w - -',30. ..... Bxd7 and now the passer is rounded up.  The passer on d4 will meet the same fate should it try to advance.
291,11,17,h5,b'3r4/p2b1pk1/p7/3P3p/8/4N3/PPK5/8 w - h6',31. ..... h5 - time I marched my own pawn up to Glendadom
292,11,18,h4,b'3r4/p2b1pk1/p7/3P4/7p/3KN3/PP6/8 w - -',32. .... h4 - onward goes the little footman.
293,11,19,Bb5+,b'3r4/p4pk1/p7/1b1P4/8/7p/PP2K3/5N2 w - -',34. .... Bb5+ - forcing off the remaining minor pieces.
294,11,20,3Kg1,b'8/p4pk1/p7/3r4/8/7p/PP6/6K1 b - -',37. Kg1 - the WK tries to cut off my passed h pawn but now my rook moves in for the kill.
295,11,21,3Kf1,b'8/p4pk1/p7/8/8/7p/PP1r4/5K2 b - -',38. Kf1 - I have now worked out that it is #3 whatever white does.  I now plumb in no less than 7 sets of conditionals.  My opponent allows me to checkmate him and I gained a handy 7 points from this victory.

Black feels obligated to protect the pawn before spending time chasing the white queen.

White however is far too smart for that.  Despite the early queen gambit he plays very well."

The threatened c pawn can easily be replaced with black's black bishop which then adds protection to the h rook via the d rook.  The d rook's cover isn't worth much in terms of a bishop/rook exchange however.  The key idea is that black is exerting more control over the center of the board.

Of course returning it with 7. ...Nf6 followed by ordinary development occurred to me and is in fact more in my nature as I'm against pawn-grabbing on principle.  But I figured I had a *moral* obligation to try to hold onto the material instead of copping out for an equal but sterile queenless middlegame as a test to my own defensive skills.

Of course this way (f6xd5) white has the chance to check on the white diagonal and it is not sure I won't have lost something in the process of coping with it. Qa4 is a strong attack for white once the f6 pawn is removed.

Did Joanne see this?
To protect the knight was a must. Qb3 was another possibility or a4 - the one I mostly was worried about. Remember white has two pieces solidly defending d2 so while the white rook is protected by the queen a possible BxR QxB threatening Rh8 would have given some compensation for the rook making the line playable. 
But the good one I think was Bd4. 
And I would have given Qd5 a look either.

656,30,3,a4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/P2PP3/2N2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - a3',7. a4 - this pawn will be the berserker but at the moment it is pretty innocuous.  This move was recommended in the DB as advantageous to white.  It does hold up the advance b5 so I can see why it was recommended.
657,30,4,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp1np1/P3p3/3PP3/2N1BN1P/1PP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',10. Be3 - development.
658,30,5,1Qd2,b'r1b1r1k1/ppqn1pbp/2p2np1/P3p3/4P3/2N1BN1P/1PPQBPP1/R4RK1 b - -',12. Qd2 - preparing a possible forced exchange of dark square bishops to weaken the black castled position.
659,30,6,1Rfd1,b'r1b1rnk1/ppq2pbp/2p2np1/P3p3/4P3/2N1BN1P/1PPQBPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',13. Rfd1 - preventing for the moment Rd8.

661,30,8,1axb6e.p.,b'r1b1rnk1/p4pbp/1PpB2p1/4p3/4Pn2/2N2N1P/1PP1BPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',17. axb6 e.p - I very nearly forgot the en passant rule and moved Fou Leblanc to f1.  Luckily this time before I pressed the submit button I remembered the rule and clicked reset and then took on b6.  Note that the a7 pawn is pinned against the a1 rook so I have won a pawn in broad daylight!
662,30,9,1b7,b'r3rnk1/pP3pbp/2pB2p1/4p3/4Pn2/2N2N1b/1PP1BPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',18. b7 - on the previous move black made a speculative sacrifice of his bishop on h3.  Before taking the bishop I saw that I would be able to win a whole rook by forcing black to give up his rook for Glenda and Fou Lenoir.  After Fou Lenoir gets removed from the board I then take on h3.  That little pawn on a4 really has gone berserk.  Here goes......
663,30,10,Rxb2,b'5nk1/p4pbp/2p3p1/4p3/4P3/2N2N1n/1rP1BP2/R2R1K2 w - -',22. .... Rxb2 - I had to allow a black rook to go on my second rank.  However I am not fazed by this as my own rook will either force an exchange of remaining rook or chase it off.  He goes for Plan B.
664,30,11,2Rd8,b'3R1nk1/pr3pbp/2p3p1/4p3/4P3/2N2N1n/R1P1BP2/5K2 b - -',24. Rd8 - I now try and turn the screw.  All my pieces are so well defended that black cannot take full advantage of the open lines available for a counter-attack.
665,30,12,2Ra8,b'R4nk1/p1r2pbp/2p3p1/4p3/4P3/2N2N1n/R1P1BP2/5K2 b - -',25. Ra8 - the black pawn on a7 will be picked off by one of the rooks and then my rooks will try and corall the c pawn.  Although I do not have many pawns on the board myself remember an extra rook is enough to win in an endgame.  My opponent decided that it was now time to wave the white flag.  I came sooo close to another missed opportunity.  I just hope I can continue to cash in.  Anyhow another 6 rating points in the bag for me and a good day at the office - hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne

This is my last game in the Traxler MT.  It ended on a fairly high note with a High Draw against Paolo but alas wrapped up in gaining material parity with him I missed a chance to get a five point lead in material against him which would have been enough to win despite our rating differential.  The moral here is always look for a better move and try not to get too wrapped up in your plan otherwise you will end up with a missed opportunity.  Gameknot analysis is provided as follows and I will pick up commentary on Move 7.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15146349&fb=1&rnd=0.6709744076164328"
667,31,1,Bb6,b'r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/1bn2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R w q -',7. ...... Bb6 - this retreat of Fou Lenoir has netted me most of the 6.5 points achieved from this MT.  That a7-g1 diagonal has actually resulted in a couple of my opponents copping Old Matey from Glenda once the d column has been opened because Fou Lenoir has prevented the WK from taking refuge on g1.
668,31,2,d5,b'r1bk3N/ppp1q1pp/1bn2n2/3pp3/4P3/1B6/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R w - d6',9. ...... d5 - this pawn move is intended to cut off the lsb's line to f7 (an escape square for the cadaverous white steed on h8) and enable either Glenda or my remaining rook to snap it up later on.
669,31,3,Nf6,b'r1bk1q1N/ppp3pp/1bn2n2/4p3/4P3/1B3Q2/PPPP2PP/R1B2K1R w - -',12. ..... Nf6 - after this move which alas has re-opened the lsb's diagonal onto f7 I have managed to narrow the deficit to 3 material points.  I still either need to get material parity or a mating attack going or I am gonna be toast!  At least backing off the knight to f6 avoids a queen trade.
670,31,4,Bc5,b'r3kq2/ppp2Npp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/Q7/PPPP2PP/R1B2K1R w - -',15. ..... Bc5 - after a few more moves Henry has been prevented from hiding away in a queenside castle and the Wicked Witch of the West has been chased around the board.  Again I prevent the exchange of queens.
671,31,5,1Qd3,b'r3kq2/ppp2Npp/1bn2n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/3Q4/PPPP2PP/R1B2K1R b - -',17. Qd3?? - Glenda should have gone to c5 immediately but alas I am half asleep here.  I am so caught up in trying to trap that wretched f7 knight that I missed a chance to go 5 points up in material with the dozy Bh5?? and to gain 15 rating points.  Sigh and double sigh!  I only saw that queen move after I hit the submit button alas it was too late as I was foiled by Qa3.
672,31,6,Kxf7,b'r7/ppp2kpp/1bn2n2/4p3/4P3/P7/P1PP2PP/R1B2K1R w - -',20. ..... Kxf7 - well so I have my material parity and perhaps a slight positional edge as white's queenside pawns were shattered by the queen trade before the white knight and the white lsb's disappearance from the board.  I still feel a bit sick about this missed opportunity.
673,31,7,Rf8,b'5r2/ppp3pp/1bn1kn2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/P1P3PP/1RB2K1R w - -',22. ...... Rf8 - threatening Nxe4 discovered check winning a pawn.  Paolo wisely moves his king out of the line of fire.
674,31,8,Nf6,b'5r2/ppp3pp/1bn1kn2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/P1PB2PP/1R2K2R w - -',24. .... Nf6 - it was sooo tempting to have played Rf2?? here.  That would have cost me a piece due to Rxb6 however.  I saw that move just as I was about to hit the submit button and played my knight back to f6.  I considered at this point to have had no more than a slight positional edge.  My opponent said that he was not happy with his position so I decided to put in a draw offer.  My opponent accepted and I gained 5 rating points.  Ah Ion I bet you thought you would never see the day when I Joanne Stevens would be disappointed with a High Draw against a 1950+ player would you?
675,32,0,Be2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I use this opening when I want to castle early in the game.

677,32,2,1Qe7,b'r3kb1r/3pqp2/ppb1p3/2p3pB/4P3/P1NP2P1/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black's not giving up the pawn without a fight.

687,32,12,2Ne3,b'3r1b2/1k2qBr1/ppbp4/2p1pQ2/4P3/P2PN1P1/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Since e5 is no longer a target of opportunity the knight's next best move is towards d5.  The black king is hiding behind the bishop on c6.  If the knight moves to d5 and black captures it with the bishop then the bishop on f7 can recapture d5 put the king in check and expose the bishop on f8 to attack by the queen.
688,32,13,2Nd5,b'5b2/1k1rqBr1/ppbp4/2pNpQ2/4P3/P2P2P1/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',The knight moves to attack.

696,33,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"I faced an opening I had never faced before: the Sicilian Defense.

I like correspondence chess because it's different from normal chess in that you are allowed to use literature and compare your game with other games from other players. So a completely unknown opening isn't that frightening in correspondence chess. I find this kind of play very instructive although I wouldn't like to miss either (normal or correspondence chess). So I read up on this famous Sicilian Defense and looked at games in the database to make for a good opening."
697,33,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This seems to be the main line of the Sicilian which I wanted to try first. It looks to me as if this is better for White than many anti-Sicilian lines although it does lead to interesting chances on both sides.
698,33,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"At this point Black has several nice alternatives all of which lead to very different and interesting games. Namely there are 5... a6 (Najdorf variation) 5... g6 (Dragon variation) 5... Nc6 (classical variation) and 5... e6 (the Scheveningen). From what I saw and read it seems to me that 5... a6 is best. It prepares b7-b5 and takes away the b5 square for White's bishop and knights. This is probably also what I would have played if I had been Black.
"
699,33,3,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"Here the book knows several variations:

The aggressive 6. Bg5 is the old main line but it seems like it leads to good chances for Black if Black defends carefully. It can in particular lead to the poisoned pawn variation after 6... e6 7. f4 Qb6 which is extremely complex and which I did not wish to face (of course I wouldn't have to play 7. f4). Now I think maybe this attack is a bit premature but Black will still have to react to it so maybe it's not that bad either. I guess I'll probably try this move next time I'm in this situation.

The Fischer-Sozin variation 6. Bc4 is not good because Black can block the diagonal with 6... e6 and then the Bc4 is of no use and threatened by b7-b5 so White would play 7. Bb3 (as otherwise Black can play b7-b5 then b5-b4 then Nxe4) and already this looks much more comfortable for Black. Black could develop Nbd7 Nc5 if he's aggressive or yet Be7 Bd7 Nc6 to build up a solid defense so 6. Bc4 just doesn't seem advisable.

The quiet 6. Be2 is just too passive for my taste.

So I decided to go for the English attack 6. Be3. I think it's a good place for the bishop to be (e.g. b6 is not such a good-looking place for the black queen anymore) and it prepares for queenside castling.

Ng4 but I think this is a good move as it gains space in the center the black e-pawn develops with a tempo and it puts the knight Nd4 in an uncomfortable position. Again probably what I would have played.

701,33,5,Nb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',No really good alternative there. 7. Nf3 blocks the f-pawn which will be important to build an attack on the kingside. 7. Ne2 blocks the white-fielded bishop and the queen's d1-h5 diagonal. Finally 7. Nf5 !? looks very dangerous...
702,33,6,f4,b'rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4PP2/1NN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',"At this point the book suggests 8. f3 but it just seems to me that White's attack on the kingside is much slower and more difficult to coordinate than Black's attack on the queenside after this move e.g. 8. (f3) Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O Nbd7 11. g4 b5 12. g5 b4 and so forth. See this excellent annotated game from byakuugan3 for more on this development:
http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/gambito-339?gm=10746

I did not want to play this line so I decided to level the playing field a little with the apparently rarely seen 8. f4. I did not find much on it in the literature but I did not find a refutation either. In my opinion 8... exf4 is the best answer as Black won't want my pawn on f5. Then after 9. Bxf4 White has an isolated e-pawn and Black has an isolated d-pawn and the chances look more or less equal to me. It's also nice to have the f-file opened so I can maybe play Rf1 later.

703,33,7,Bd2,b'rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pb3/4p3/4PPn1/1NN5/PPPB2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"Admittedly 8... Ng4 is a tempting-looking move and this is exactly what 8. f3 would have prevented. However when taking a closer look the only thing that this lone knight threatens is my bishp on e3. Of course I could protect him with moves like e.g. 9. Qd2 or 9. Qe2 but I did not want to give Black the (probably good) option to exchange his knight for my bishop as I thought I would probably still need it to build my attack on the kingside. So I just retreated the bishop to Bd2 and now the black knight is in a bad place.

The only (slight) drawback to this move is that my queen does not control d5 anymore. When playing against a Sicilian I guess you usually don't want your opponent to be able to boost his queen's pawn to d5 but here d5 is still sufficiently protected with my knight on c3 and my pawn on e4 since Black's knight is not on f6 anymore to control d5.

I think that Black should instead finally play 9... exf4 even though after (9. ... exf4) 10. Bxf4 the situation is essentially the same as it would have been if Black had played exf4 one move sooner except that now his knight is in a less good position.

But 9... Nf6 leaves me with the option of playing 10. f5 an opportunity which I shall not refuse.

Bxf5 and the f-pawn is lost. Protecting the pawn with my rook isn't good either: 18. Rf2 could lead to 18... d5 (good move the d-boost has happened) or maybe even 18... Bxf5 19. Rxf5 Nxf5 20.

If Black chooses to move the queen he has to be careful:
If 19... Qc6? (threatening to take the white queen if the knight on d5 moves) leads of course to 20. Nxe7+ Kh8 21. Nxc6 and wins.
If 19... Qd7 then 20. f6 Nf5 21. Ne7+ Kh8 22. Bxf5 with a dangerous attack.
So I guess the only alternative for Black would be to retreat the queen again with 19... Qd8 where I would probably play 20. Rg1 (intending 21. f6) to continue my kingside attack.

716,33,20,2Qxd5,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2p4/3QpP2/7P/1N5B/PPPR4/2K4R b - -',"Now I'm threatening to take Black's d-pawn. In my opinion this was one of the most interesting situations in the game. So I have to tell you my thoughts.

I really thought that Black would play 20... Rd8 the only possible move to protect his pawn (note that 20... Qc6 doesn't help after 21. Qxc6 bxc6 22. Rxd6). Then I would have played 21. Nc5 !? (it's an original move I was really happy about this idea). Black shouldn't try to take my knight:

If 21... dxc5?? then forced checkmate with 22. Qxd8+ Qxd8 23. Rxd8#.

If 21... Qxc5? then 22. Qxc5 and I win the queen (22... dxc5?? 23. Rxd8#).

Now my knight is in a really good position there on c5 because he can go to e4 (threatening the pawn on d6) or maybe even be sacrificed on e6!

For example 21... Rb8 is probably Black's strongest answer in that position (planning on b7-b5 or b7-b6 followed by Bb7 to threaten the diagonal where the white queen and rook are). In that case I might have played 22. Ne6 fxe6 23. fxe6 with an attack that has some potential.

Black could also try to move his bishop e.g. 21... Bxf5. In that case 22. Nxb7 and the black rook on d8 has to move away after which follows 23. Bxf5 and I win Black's bishop.

If Black is tricky and plays 21... Be6 threatening my queen then 22. Nxe6 fxe6 and I have the choice between 23. Qxe6+ or 23. fxe6 which are both strong (I'm unsure whether 22. fxe6 would be good because of 22... dxc5).

There are even more variations here and I could go on but these are some of the most interesting. Therefore I have to say that 20... Rd8 21. Nc5 would have led to an extremely interesting game and I would have played it just for that even though I can't possibly have foreseen all consequences.

Unfortunately my opponent decided otherwise. That's chess!

The d-pawn can become very strong if Black decides to advance his two center pawns and now Black has only one extra pawn against my extra knight. Also my knight is now free to go to c5. This almost forces a queen exchange since I threaten both Black's unprotected queen and his bishop (the only alternative for Black being 21... Qc6 threatening my rook).
"
718,33,22,2Rg1,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p1bR4/4pP2/7P/1N5B/PPP5/2K3R1 b - -',"Alternatively 23. Rd1 would have been strong too. However I decided for 23. Rg1 so I could play f5-f6 in the next move. If 23. (Rg1) f6 then I would probably first chase Black's bishop away (e.g. 24. Na5) followed by Rd7 threatening Black's g-pawn.

I played f5-f6 as intended with the main idea that after 24... g6 (the only sensible move for Black) Black's f-pawn is blocked and so now his e-pawn is on its own. I have one extra knight plus a king waiting on the finish line so it shouldn't be too difficult to stop this pawn.

720,33,24,2Na5,b'r3r1k1/1p3p1p/p1bR1Pp1/N3p3/7P/7B/PPP5/2K3R1 b - -',"Since my rook on g1 is not of much use any longer where he is I should probably move him to d1. However I think this can yet wait a bit. Another nice move at this point is 25. Bd7 since this forces Black to trade bishops if he doesn't want to loose the exchange. However after 25. Bd7 Bxd7 26. Rxd7 Re6! my f-pawn is in an uncomfortable position. I could try to protect him but I don't want to be in the defensive. As long as my bishop controls e6 my opponent cannot play Re6 so at the moment I prefer to keep my bishop.

Hence I went for 25. Na5 for two main reasons:
First this also threatens Black's bishop. Assuming he wants to stay in the main diagonal (and protect b7) he can go to either e4 or f3 where f3 is preferrable because it doesn't block the e-pawn; but both squares are less desirable for him than c6.
Second on my side I can then go on to c4 with my knight from where he controls e3 e5 and d6 so that my extra knight is really put to some use.

I don't understand why he didn't play Bf3 planning on advancing his pawn to e4. My knight who can go to c4 to threaten e5 is now very dangerous for him since he cannot simply move the pawn away. Black's only piece protecting the e-pawn is the rook and now I can easily force that one away by playing Bd7 since Black's bishop doesn't control d7 anymore. Note that even if he's tricky and responds 26. (Bd7) Rad8 (so that after 27. Bxe8 would follow 27... Rxd6) I can still play 27. Nc4 and now my rook on d6 is protected and Black's rook on the e-file can only retreat back to f8.

I keep Black moving forcing him to react to my moves so that he cannot act of his own accord. I'm coordinating my pieces step by step while Black is pushed in a defensive position increasingly difficult to hold. He certainly neither wanted his bishop blocking the e-file nor his rook away from the e-file. I have a lot of room and options while Black's pieces are squeezed together and have a limited number of options.

786,36,30,3Re8,b'3kr3/pr6/R7/3PpB1p/P2p1pp1/3P4/5PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Perhaps black feared a white rook moving to c8 and once the king moves to e7 I could skewer the rook in the h8 corner.  That would leave my king unprotected against a back row mate.
787,36,31,Ke7,b'4r3/pr2k3/2R5/3PpB1p/P2p1pp1/3P4/5PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Here the black king tries to retreat to the other side of the e8 rook.  This opens up possibilities.
788,36,32,Kd7,b'4r3/pr1k4/4R3/3PpB1p/P2p1pp1/3P4/5PPP/2R3K1 w - -',The king moves into a nice setup for a discovered attack.
789,36,33,3Rxe5+,b'4r3/pr1k4/8/3PRB1p/P2p1pp1/3P4/5PPP/2R3K1 b - -',Taking the pawn is better than taking the rook in this discovered attack.  If I took the rook now the king would merely take it back.  This way I can weaken black's pawn structure and get the rook in the next move for nearly free.
790,36,34,3Kd6,b'4r3/pr6/3k4/3PRB1p/P2p1pp1/3P4/5PPP/2R3K1 w - -',"Now the black rook is left all alone.  Black seeing the position as hopeless decides to resign.
If black continued play I would pick off the rook on e8.  Black's king takes the pawn on d5.  The bishop moves to e4 - putting the king in check and when the king moves back to the one safe square the rook on b7 is left unsupported by an attack from the bishop."
