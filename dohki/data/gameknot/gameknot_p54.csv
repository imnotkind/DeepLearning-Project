43,1,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White opens passage for his bishop to be able to put me in check at some point.
44,1,2,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppbpppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Serves the dual purpose of developing the bishop and preventing white's ability to make the move previously mentioned.
45,1,3,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pppbpppp/8/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White strengthens the middle with this move.
46,1,4,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Let both my bishop and my queen a way out.
47,1,5,c4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',A gambit perhaps to move my pawn away from the center and further his control over the center.
48,1,6,dxc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I accept the gambit.
49,1,7,Bxc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White takes. This move was perhaps not the best because...
50,1,8,Bb3,b'rn1qkbnr/p1pb1ppp/4p3/1p6/3P4/1B2PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',...the bishop is forced away easily.
51,1,9,Nc3,b'r2qkbnr/p1pb1ppp/2n1p3/1p6/3P4/1BN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White is now behind a turn. I develop my knight and he responds in kind.

60,1,18,1bxc3,b'r2qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/2n1pn2/1p6/3PP3/PBP2N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The exchange thusly.
61,1,19,1Rb8,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/2n1pn2/1p6/3PP3/PBP2N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Backing of another pawn with a rook for a chance to move up. I missed the chance of a better move of NxE4 because the pawn at this point is entirely unprotected.
62,1,20,1Bc2,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/2n1pn2/1p6/3PP3/P1P2N2/2BB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White also sees this and protects his pawn.
63,1,21,1Na5,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/4pn2/np6/3PP3/P1P2N2/2BB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I lock his bishop from going back. While this knight can't do much in the corner my pieces can't breathe as it is.
64,1,22,1e5,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/4pn2/np2P3/3P4/P1P2N2/2BB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',An attempt to attack my other knight however it is an effort in futility. His move allowed Nd5 to be safe and results in a weakening of control of the center for him. Ah but that's not white's plan at all is it? Ponder Nd5 Bg5. His plan was to attack my queen and I cannot take the assailant because of the knight protecting it.
65,1,23,1Bg5,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb1ppp/4p3/np1nP1B1/3P4/P1P2N2/2B2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I let it happen anyway...

68,1,26,1Qd3,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb3p/4pp2/np1n2B1/3P4/P1PQ1N2/2B2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',...or lose his bishop. That works too. A better move would have been Bh6 which would have allowed him to move his queen in and put my king in a corner. Instead...
69,1,27,1Qd2,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb3p/4p3/np1n2p1/3P4/P1P2N2/2BQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',...and now he is behind in terms of development and material. Even his strong control of the center in the beginning of the game has dissipated.
70,1,28,1Nc4,b'1r1qr1k1/p1pb3p/4p3/1p1n2p1/2nP4/P1P2N2/2BQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Attacking his queen from a safe place...

72,1,30,1Qf6,b'1r2r1k1/p1pb3p/4pq2/1p1n2p1/2nP4/P1PQ1N2/2B2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I finally develop my own queen after a long period of waiting.

74,1,32,2Kf8,b'1r2rk2/p1pb3Q/4pq2/1p1n2p1/2nP4/P1P2N2/2B2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',That bishop looks very appetizing. But it's a trap. The best move here would be to either retreat with the attack or at least attack the bishop more elegantly with Ne5. While this results in a loss of knight it's the extra knight that loses his queen. This also results in me moving my queen further from the action leaving his queen to then gobble up the bishop without worry.
75,1,33,Na5,b'1r2rk2/p1pQ4/4pq2/np1n2p1/3P4/P1P2N2/2B2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is what locks him in. If he wants his queen to survive at this point he needs to move it back where it was. Any other move results in the loss of his queen.
76,1,34,2Be4,b'1r2rk2/p1pQ4/4pq2/np1n2p1/3PB3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He attempts to attack my other knight but that just seals his fate...
77,1,35,2Re7,b'1r3k2/p1pQr3/4pq2/np1n2p1/3PB3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',...as I've now forced him into a trade for his queen. The knights protect the pawns c7 and a7 the rook at e7 and also prevents movement to the squares b6 c6 and b7. The pawn c7 protects the square d6 the pawn e6 protects the knight the rook at b8 protects the pawn at b5 and finally the entire 8th row. His only way to save face is to take the rook...
78,1,36,2Qxe7+,b'1r3k2/p1p1Q3/4pq2/np1n2p1/3PB3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',...which he at least does.
79,1,37,2Nxe7,b'1r3k2/p1p1n3/4pq2/np4p1/3PB3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Yoink!
80,1,38,2Rfe1,b'1r3k2/p1p1n3/4pq2/np4p1/3PB3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Once his attack has run out of steam The next few moves deal with driving him back.
81,1,39,2Rac1,b'1r3k2/p7/2p1pq2/np1n2p1/3P4/P1PB1N2/5PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',At this point he protects his pawn otherwise I would have taken it.
82,1,40,2g4,b'1r3k2/p7/2p1pq2/np1n4/3P2p1/P1PB1N2/5PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',What looks like an attack of his knight is actually...
83,1,41,g3,b'1r3k2/p7/2p1pq2/np1nN3/3P4/P1PB2p1/5PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',...what some would consider a bit of an odd choice. What I'm doing is forcing him to remove the stalwart choke that white has on the e file. He either has to take the pawn which blocks one pawn and fizzles the protection on the right side.
84,1,42,2fxg3,b'1r3k2/p7/2p1pq2/np1nN3/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',He takes the offered material.
85,1,43,2Qg5,b'1r3k2/p7/2p1p3/np1nN1q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Now it's a losing battle for him as he struggles to keep me from collapsing in on him. He still attempts to continue what is now a pointless attack...
86,1,44,2Nd7+,b'1r3k2/p2N4/2p1p3/np1n2q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',...with the only piece near my king and no protection. Of course you could say that he's trying to even the odds by forcing a take on the other rook but with its position it's way less important than the other pieces.
87,1,45,3Nxb8,b'1N6/p3k3/2p1p3/np1n2q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',And he takes the rook. His knight is now in the same useless position that my rook was in. You are what you eat I suppose.
88,1,46,3Ne3,b'1N6/p3k3/2p1p3/np4q1/3P4/P1PBn1P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Continuing the pressure on his king.
89,1,47,3Na6,b'8/p3k3/N1p1p3/np4q1/3P4/P1PBn1P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',He's still moving his knight but its of no use in the corner.
90,1,48,3Nb3,b'8/p3k3/N1p1p3/1p4q1/3P4/PnPBn1P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Now he has to move his rook because he knows that I'll gladly trade...
91,1,49,3Nb4,b'8/p3k3/2p1p3/1p4q1/1N1P4/PnPBn1P1/6PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',...or perhaps he doesn't.
92,1,50,3Rxc1,b'8/p3k3/2p1p3/1p4q1/1N1P4/P1PBn1P1/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',He's now in the most horrid of positions nearly all of which end in a checkmate. Once I move my knight out of the way that opens for a loss of rook and a check in one swoop.
93,1,51,3Nxc6+,b'8/p3k3/2N1p3/1p1n2q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',Oddly enough he still attempts to attack my king perhaps to stall for a better shot at defending himself. Alas...
94,1,52,3Kd6,b'8/p7/2Nkp3/1p1n2q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',...easily rectified...
95,1,53,3Nxa7,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p1n2q1/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',...back in the corner you go!
96,1,54,3Qxc1+,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p1n4/3P4/P1PB2P1/6PP/2q3K1 w - -',At this point he's toast. Not only does he have less material than me it's only in pawns a bishop and a knight. On top of it his king is on the run.
97,1,55,3Bf1,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p1n4/3P4/P1P3P1/6PP/2q2BK1 b - -',He blocks with his bishop...
98,1,56,3Qe3+,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p1n4/3P4/P1P1q1P1/6PP/5BK1 w - -',...but that only prolongs the inevitable.
99,1,57,Nxc3,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p6/3P4/P1n1q1P1/6PP/5B1K w - -',A good chance to gobble up a pawn.
100,1,58,3g4,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p6/3P2P1/P1n1q3/6PP/5B1K b - -',Perhaps an attempt to distract me into addressing the possible promotion? I ignore it...
101,1,59,3Qe1,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p6/3P2P1/P1n5/6PP/4qB1K w - -',...because now that my knight is in close proximity he has nowhere to go.
102,1,60,3Kg1,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p6/3P2P1/P1n5/6PP/4qBK1 b - -',This move causes mate in two. For those in which it is not obvious figure the move Ne2+. He can't take the knight with his bishop because of the queen that pins him there. He can really only move it back...
103,1,61,Qxf1#,b'8/N7/3kp3/1p6/3P2P1/P7/4n1PP/5q1K w - -',...which leads to the checkmate.
104,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I'll open up with the most typical move.
105,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This time instead of French he'll do something different which I'm very used to. 
106,2,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Yes the anticipated Ruy Lopez.
107,2,3,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Of course.  A move that you typically see from masters and grandmasters as Jack told me.
108,2,4,Bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I take.  While not so bad as it's toward the center my idea is to still double his pawns.  Since he cannot take back with his Q I did not see how this would strengthen his structure.  Plus as this is a similar instince that happened in my game against Jack that if I played 4.Ba4 once 4...b5 I'd lose my B since it would be locked with my pawns.  However the oversight and paradox is that 5.Bb3 would be an option.  The difference with Jack is that the N was pinned and a pawn was already on the fifth rank.  So when he attacked it I played a similar move.  Not sure but let's suppose it was like this so Ba4 then he played ...b5 so since the pawn was on a5 once I played ...Bb3 he was able to win a piece for a pawn after the immediate a4.  So that where I miscalculated by mixing concepts which is something you don't want to do.  Instead the best move here was 4.Ba4 as it's conventional since most master and GM's play that.
109,2,5,dxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Conventional.
110,2,6,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So I waste no time in deciding to castle.  The idea castle early and often and get that K to safety.
111,2,7,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',To pin my N.  But of course I won't do anything about that right away because it is a nuisance and nothing serious.
112,2,8,Nc3,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So instead I'll use that time to continue with development.
113,2,9,Qf6,b'r3kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p2q2/4p3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I knew there was a plan behind this but wasn't sure how he'd do that by bringing the Q out before completing development before but there is a well known orchestrated because what follows is something similar to what Jack did and afterward he had a slight advantage already.
114,2,10,d3,b'r3kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p2q2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The DSB needs to come out one way or another to complete development.  But I decided on this move rather then a fianchetto because this is a center pawn needed to control the center.  If I fianchettoed it would be a wasted move when the time needs to be used to contest the center which is the decision behind this.  Plus I don't lose anything and am not forced to waste time since my LSB is no longer around.
115,2,11,Ne7,b'r3kb1r/1pp1nppp/p1p2q2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',While that DSB is crammed still a good way to develop and white still have some really good idea.
116,2,12,Bg5,b'r3kb1r/1pp1nppp/p1p2q2/4p1B1/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',? Mistake as the computer shows and that's because this move loses a pawn no matter what I do.  What the computer for the next few moves is exactly what gets played.  With that the computer says that best was 8.Qe2 with the idea of 8...0-0-0 9.Be3 Bxf3 10.Qxf3 Qxf3 11.gxf3 Ng6 12.Kh1 Be7 13.Rg1 Rd7 14.a4 Rhd8 15.a5 h5 16.Rad1  I agree.  
117,2,13,Bxf6,b'r3kb1r/1pp1nppp/p1p2B2/4p3/4P3/2NP1b2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',There was another option that I looked at which wouldn't lose material.  That is 9.Qxf3?? but the problem then is that he has 9...Qxf3 and after 10.gxf3 my K is exposed which I was not going to allow so this was the best move.  In fact this Q exchange very similar to what happened in a game against Jack where we exchanged with other pieces but when he did this like wise he also had a slight advantage and it was due to a miscalculation. 
118,2,14,1Bxe7,b'r3kb1r/1pp1Bppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2b1RK1 b kq -',The only other move that came to mind was 10.Rxd1?? to prevent losing the pawn or so I thought.  But I looked at it and realized that this is bad because I wind up a piece down after 10...gxf6 which I was not going to do.
119,2,15,1Bxf8,b'r3kB1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPb2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',The analysis here is completely wrong as they say that with my previous 11.Rae1 would be indirectly.  That's not true and that move would be a blunder as I'd be more then a piece down.  This was best to prevent that.
120,2,16,1Rxf8,b'r3kr2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPb2PPP/R4RK1 w q -',Of course.  But now I looked at how the pawn could be defended and there is no way to do that which means that I lose another.
121,2,17,1Rae1,b'r3kr2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPb2PPP/4RRK1 b q -',?! The idea is to attack the center because as I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club attacking the center is a way to control the center.  This however is an inaccuracy because it loses another pawn.  Instead better was 12.f4 and then pawns are exchanged instead.  After that comes 12...exf4 13.d4 0-0-0 14.Rxf4 Rxd4 15.Raf1 Rd7 16.e5 Bg6 17.e6 Re7 18.exf7 Rfxf7 19.Rxf7 Bxf7 20.Rd1 Rd7 21.Re1
122,2,18,1f3,b'2kr1r2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/3b1P2/PP2N1PP/4RRK1 b - -',Now the computer says that the continuation is 14.f4 but I disagree with it.  First that that allows black to liquidate with 14...exf4 when down material.  Plus this achieves a solid pawn chain.  Remember when I disagreed over pawn structures and said what I would've well this is the kind of thing I was alluding to.  Here it's no blunder because it also improves the mobility of my f R which has the pressure of his LSB due to this half pin against my N.
123,2,19,1Bb5,b'2kr1r2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/5P2/PP2N1PP/4RRK1 w - -',However I do not know why he played this.
124,2,20,1Rf2,b'2kr1r2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/5P2/PP2NRPP/4R1K1 b - -',But this was also my plan behind 14.f3 is that the R is now mobile and my N is no longer half pin so that I'm now free to move it without the loss of material which was the idea. 
125,2,21,1Rd2,b'2k2r2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/5P2/PP1rNRPP/4R1K1 w - -',He is deciding to apply the pressure.  
126,2,22,1Nc3,b'2k2r2/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/2N2P2/PP1r1RPP/4R1K1 b - -',But I have ways around it especially given that the N is not pinned as noted above.
127,2,23,1Rfd8,b'2kr4/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/2N2P2/PP1r1RPP/4R1K1 w - -',Doubling up and putting pressure.  And now I've got no idea what to do in this position.
128,2,24,1Rxd2,b'2kr4/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/2N2P2/PP1R2PP/4R1K1 b - -',Generally speaking I don't like liquidation when down material even if less then a piece.  But here there was no choice because of that LSB so if I didn't take while not right away he would've won more material which I was not going to allow.
129,2,25,1Rxd2,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/2N2P2/PP1r2PP/4R1K1 w - -',So now it boils down to what to do next.
130,2,26,1b3,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2r2PP/4R1K1 b - -',Ok the idea here was the same for the most part pawn chains.  But unlike before it's not a good use of that.  Instead best was 18.Nd1 keeping the pawn protecting whilst putting pressure on the R.  
131,2,27,1Rc2,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1b2p3/4P3/1PN2P2/P1r3PP/4R1K1 w - -',So now I'm forced to exchange pieces which is the last thing I wanted.  Anything else would lose the a pawn.  
132,2,28,1Nxb5,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p1p5/1N2p3/4P3/1P3P2/P1r3PP/4R1K1 b - -',With that being said my original instinct was to play 19.a4 but then he plays captures the pawn and when I take back he gets my R.  So this is best. 
133,2,29,1cxb5,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/1P3P2/P1r3PP/4R1K1 w - -',Of course.
134,2,30,2a3,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/PP3P2/2r3PP/4R1K1 b - -',The idea was to prevent the loss of another pawn.  But he still wins it with the next move and with it 20.Ra1 was best.
135,2,31,2Ra2,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/PP3P2/r5PP/4R1K1 w - -',Yes and like I said he gets another pawn no matter what I do.
136,2,32,2a4,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/1p2p3/P3P3/1P3P2/r5PP/4R1K1 b - -',Not knowing what to do I go after the pawn.  Of course I still don't like exchanging but that's only with pieces.  With pawns however I don't have a problem doing so especially when it strengthens my position a little after what I lost.
137,2,33,2bxa4,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/p3P3/1P3P2/r5PP/4R1K1 w - -',Of course.
138,2,34,2bxa4,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/P3P3/5P2/r5PP/4R1K1 b - -',But I'm not going to go easy.
139,2,35,2Rxa4,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/r3P3/5P2/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',As I calculated there.
140,2,36,2Rc1,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/r3P3/5P2/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',Ok since I'm down material I try to come up with a plan to win back a pawn.  It's good that I'm thinking ahead but the plan is quite bad as we're about to see.  The idea is to maneuver that R get it on the seventh rank and nab a pawn there.
141,2,37,2Ra2,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/4P3/5P2/r5PP/2R3K1 w - -',To put pressure on the first rank and the plan there is to get a passed pawn and promote.
142,2,38,2Rc5,b'2k5/1pp2ppp/p7/2R1p3/4P3/5P2/r5PP/6K1 b - -',? The idea is win a pawn but as the computer says this is a mistake.  And that's because it gives black a passed pawn after 24...b5!!  Instead best was 24.f4 exf4 25.Rf1 Kd7 26.Rxf4 Ke6 27.Rf3 h6 28.Rg3 g6 29.Rh3 Re2 30.Rxh6 Rxe4 31.Rh7 Rd4 32.Kf2 Rd2+ 33.Kf3
143,2,39,2Rxe5,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/1p2R3/4P3/5P2/r5PP/6K1 b - -',"?? As part of the plan.  Now for a while I've been debating when ""To take is a mistake""  This happened in my game easy19 where I took the R and overlooked a mate threat.  But in my game against archduke_piccolo and could and ought to have taken his R though not right away.  So I figured this was a similar situation especially since I didn't see any immediate mate threats.  But there was most certainly a threat that I overlooked.  And taking was a terrible idea this time as it loses very quickly.  That pawn will promote and black will do damage.  And in fact the promotions will happen earlier.  So as noted based on what the computer best was 25.Rd5.  And actually I disagree with the computer about 25.Rd5 as best because the result would be the same with black's next move.  Instead that R had to remain on c5."
144,2,40,2b4,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/4R3/1p2P3/5P2/r5PP/6K1 w - -',And this pawn is going to promote and when it does I'm in big trouble.  Acutally similar to what happened in my game against angellis as I won the R the same way with a promotion but this time unlike with Jack with no miscalculation.
145,2,41,2Rc5,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/2R5/1p2P3/5P2/r5PP/6K1 b - -',But I'm not quite ready to use my K as a weapon so this what I decide to play.  The idea is that I'm going right after the P though with the last move it's too little too late to stop from the promotion.  If the R hadn't move I could've prevented that from occurring which is why taking was a big mistake.
146,2,42,2b3,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/2R5/4P3/1p3P2/r5PP/6K1 w - -',Still making it's way.

149,2,45,2Rb3,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/8/4P3/1R3P2/rp4PP/6K1 b - -',"Still doing what I can however.  I actually wanted to play and was thinking about 28.Rc2 but black would immediately mate after 28...b1=Q#  Worth noting is the fact that in the past I've missed that mate.  But that's where I remember easy19's advice to ""Be a spectator of your game which I emphasize to my students.  In one respect using as a teaching tool with a move which overlooked mate and I delivered it teaching that same thing.  So another way to say that I used what Fred said to teach others in my first loss against him."
150,2,46,2Ra1+,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/8/4P3/1R3P2/1p4PP/r5K1 w - -',Guaranteeing the promotion because if black did so immediately with 28...b1=Q+ this time he would lose a pawn after 29.Rxb1.  But this prevents that.  And as we know and like I calculated black is not going to underestimate because he knows what my R can really do if he doesn't do something right away as he did here.
151,2,47,2Kf2,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/8/4P3/1R3P2/1p3KPP/r7 b - -',Forced.

154,2,50,3Ke3,b'2k5/2p2ppp/p7/8/4P3/4KP2/6PP/1r6 b - -',So now's the time where I decide to use my K as a weapon.  And now I'm going to attempt to make use of the opposition anyway.  However as I discover shortly after it's of no use and more or less irrelevant due to what's happened.
155,2,51,3a5,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/p7/4P3/4KP2/6PP/1r6 w - -',But now he's going to promote.  
156,2,52,3Kf4,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/p7/4PK2/5P2/6PP/1r6 b - -',I did consider 32.Kd4 to stop this but it's useless because that R effectively prevents my K from reaching the b file when it would have to take on the a file to stop that pawn.  Plus now I also see a potential mating sequence which I know can not be stopped.  With best play I can delay it but not for long.  Of course I'll just keep playing. 
157,2,53,3a4,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/8/p3PK2/5P2/6PP/1r6 w - -',Making it's way but to this time a Q and then some as noted above.

160,2,56,3Kd2,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/8/4P3/p4P2/3K2PP/1r6 b - -',?? Still seeing what I can do but as it turns out this is a blunder because it allows black to mate that much quicker.  Instead best was 34.Kf4 and even after 34...a2 35.h4 a1=Q 36.h5 Rb5 37.Kg4 Qh1 38.Kg3 Rg5+ 39.Kf2 Qxg2+ 40.Ke3 Rxh5 41.Kd4 Qxf3

That's why I emphasized in previous annotations but as I learned only recently with Jack by not making the mistake it's not always a good idea to think that way.
162,2,58,3Kc2,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/8/4P3/5P2/p1K3PP/1r6 b - -',So I'll keep my K as a weapon and try to make it difficult is the only way to describe but it just makes it that much easier for black.

166,2,62,3Qc3+,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/8/2K1P3/1rq2P2/6PP/8 w - -',Like I said even with a move longer it's not any more difficult for black.

168,2,64,3Rb5#,b'2k5/2p2ppp/8/1r1K4/4P3/2q2P2/6PP/8 w - -',The only move that I did not calculate.  I thought his next move would be 38...Qa5+ in which I have a three options but no matter he would have a mate in one.  But I just did not realize that it was mate immediately.  Interesting game but what I learned there is more involved of when taking is actually mistake not just for immediate mate threats but also about pawn promotions.  And it's important to calcaulate but doing so accurately is important.  So what I learned is one way to do that is by not mixing too many concept and while thinking ahead is important don't overthink things.  Actually in some cases thinking about too many things like the strategy behind taking the pawn or getting the K on c2 which was a mistake.  It's easy to follow what a lot of people say but sometimes there are limits and you can't do too much at one time as that's where you start making mistakes.  And thinking about too many things in any position can also cause problems it's overthinking things which in chess and life the idea is think but then let those thoughts go to avoid cramming so that you can still concentrate on the position.

270,7,4,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black's standard follow-up opening a diagonal for his Q and applying pressure on White's centre.
271,7,5,a3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White asks the B the question: swap or retreat?  Swapping is by far the most frequent response.
272,7,6,Ba5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I have met this retreat before but couldn't remember how to respond so had to have a think ...
273,7,7,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',?! This does feature in Nunn's Chess Openings as a rare sideline.  Nunn gives 6. b4 as the best move and 6. dxc5 as an unclear continuation.  Nunn seems to regard this move as acceptable if followed up correctly.
274,7,8,cxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/3p4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',White having cut off support for the d-pawn Black snaffles it and attacks White's N.
275,7,9,Nce2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/3p4/P7/1PPBNPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',? Not considered by Nunn who gives 7. Nb5 as the best response.  Although White threatens to recapture the pawn on d4 and attacks Black's B the N blocks in White's kingside pieces.
276,7,10,Bc7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P7/1PPBNPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Now Black attacks the loose pawn on e5.  If White captures on d4 the B captures on e5 and skewers the N against the pawn on b2.  White will have lost both his central pawns leaving Black's solid centre unopposed.
277,7,11,Nexd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3N4/P4N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now that I can swap pieces on d4 or e5 if necessary I decide to take the pawn on d4 while I can releasing my LSB for action.
278,7,12,Nxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3n4/P4N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I'd expected Black to capture on e5 but this makes sense as well removing White's most advanced piece and forcing White to relinquish e5 to boot.
279,7,13,Bxe5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pb3/3N4/P7/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',As predicted Nd4 and pawn on b2 are skewered and I'm a serious pawn down with no compensation.  I'll have to play well to recover.  In trying to work out a plan I now fell well behind on the clock.
280,7,14,1Bc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I decided that this was the most active method of defending the N with my DSB disputing the long diagonal.  I also considered 11. c3 giving my Q scope on the d1-a4 diagonal but didn't think there would be much benefit in trying to exploit that while Black could simply play ....Bd7 if I tried to check on the a4-e8 diagonal.
281,7,15,1Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now every square on the long dark diagonal is occupied Black is ready to castle and can then concentrate on exploiting his material advantage.
282,7,16,1Be2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I too prepare to castle.  I also considered 12. Bb5+ but didn't want to invite swaps while still a pawn down and 12. Bd3 but didn't want to block off the Queen's defence of d4.
283,7,17,1a6,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Presumably to prevent 13. Nb5 or to support the pawn advance ...b5.  Now with my B on e2 and the square b5 unavailable I can't move my N and simultaneously provide a non-pawn defence of the Bc3.  I don't want the pawns on my queenside to be compromised if I can avoid it.
284,7,18,1O-O,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I proceed with my development as quickly as I can aiming to get my pieces posted on good squares and then to attack wherever I can find a potential weakness.
285,7,19,1Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Unexpected ... I was surprised that Black seemed to be wasting tempi before he had castled.  As we didn't have the chance to analyse afterwards I don't know the thinking behind this sequence of moves but I imagine he was looking to attack the Nd4 with his e-pawn and make an advanced salient with his central pawns.
286,7,20,1Re1,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',I put my rook on the half-open e-file hoping maybe to win back the pawn by capturing on d5 when the e-pawn is pinned but also preparing a lift to the third rank and possibly a redeployment of my LSB via f1
287,7,21,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black sensibly moves his King out of the line of fire.
288,7,22,1Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/8/P1B2N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Now I wanted to advance my N to e5 or g5 to engage with Black's defences.
289,7,23,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/8/P1B2N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black contests the e-file and supports the advance of the e-pawn.
290,7,24,1Bd3,b'r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/8/P1BB1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',With this move I aimed at h7 while ensuring that Back couldn't advance his pawns with impunity: I had three pieces covering e5 while he had only 2 supporting the potential advance.
291,7,25,1Bd7,b'r2qr1k1/1p1b1ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/8/P1BB1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black develops his last minor piece and prepares to occupy the c-file with his QR.
292,7,26,1Qd2,b'r2qr1k1/1p1b1ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/8/P1BB1N2/1PPQ1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',The purpose of this move was to defend both Bc3 and the pawn on f2 against potential attacks while connecting my rooks.  Once the QR was centralised I'd be ready for more aggressive action.
293,7,27,1h6,b'r2qr1k1/1p1b1pp1/p2bpn1p/3p4/8/P1BB1N2/1PPQ1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Presumably Black didn't want my Q or N coming to g5
294,7,28,1h3,b'r2qr1k1/1p1b1pp1/p2bpn1p/3p4/8/P1BB1N1P/1PPQ1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',So I took the opportunity to create a breathing space for my own K and prevent his N coming to g4 whence it would have attacked f2 and h2.
295,7,29,1Rad1,b'2rqr1k1/1p1b1pp1/p2bpn1p/3p4/8/P1BB1N1P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',I felt that this was potentially a more attacking square than c1.  My heart was set on a kingside attack now as my bishops were already ideally deployed to rake his king's position and Black seemed to be concentrating mainly on the queenside.
296,7,30,1Bc6,b'2rqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1bbpn1p/3p4/8/P1BB1N1P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Now Black seemed to be threatening ...d4 attacking my DSB and threatening a swap on f3 that would have ruined my kingside pawns.
297,7,31,2Be5,b'2rqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1bbpn1p/3pB3/8/P2B1N1P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',I decided to avoid the idea mentioned in my last note by using this B to occupy e5 where eventually I wanted my N to be established.
298,7,32,2Bxe5,b'2rqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1b1pn1p/3pb3/8/P2B1N1P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Surprisingly Black cooperated.  I think he might have been better off letting me swap on d6 (if I wanted to) and using the recapture to develop his Q onto a strong square.
299,7,33,2Nxe5,b'2rqr1k1/1p3pp1/p1b1pn1p/3pN3/8/P2B3P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',Now I was planning to lift a rook via e3 to f3 or g3 as appropriate and Q via f4 to the kingside for a direct kingside assault.  I wasn't sure how I would shift Black's N from f6 though.  Could I afford a pawn advance in front of my King?
300,7,34,2Qb6,b'2r1r1k1/1p3pp1/pqb1pn1p/3pN3/8/P2B3P/1PPQ1PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Black pins my f-pawn and also threatens b2.
301,7,35,2c3,b'2r1r1k1/1p3pp1/pqb1pn1p/3pN3/8/P1PB3P/1P1Q1PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',Played to defend the b-pawn with my Q and inhibit Black from trying to occupy d4.  I also thought that I might be able to retreat my B to c2 or b1 and line up my Q and B against h7.
302,7,36,2Ba4,b'2r1r1k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/b7/P1PB3P/1P1Q1PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',Annoying: either I block the attack on the Rd1 with my B and probably have it swapped off or I have to move the R to a less optimal square.
303,7,37,Bb3,b'2r1r1k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/8/PbPB3P/1P1Q1PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',This was played very quickly and had obviously been planned but it took me completely by surprise.  Presumably Black wanted to block my queenside pawns and possibly swap off a pair of minor pieces on c4 depriving my planned attack of the necessary forces.
304,7,38,2Qf4,b'2r1r1k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/5Q2/PbPB3P/1P3PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',As the Q was no longer lumbered with the duty of defending b2 I hastened her off to the kingside whence she still defended f2 but now looked directly through the Nf6 to f7.
305,7,39,2Red8,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/5Q2/PbPB3P/1P3PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',Another unexpected move.  Presumably Black was preparing a retreat for his N and also supporting a potential advance to d4.  I now gave serious consideration to Bh7+ with a view to taking f7 if Black captured either with King or N.
306,7,40,2g4,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/5QP1/PbPB3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - g3',However I couldn't make that idea work and decided instead to dislodge his N with a pawn thrust.  I didn't feel this was too risky as most of his forces were away on the queenside and I needed to prosecute my attack with speed and vigour.
307,7,41,2Bc4,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN3/2b2QP1/P1PB3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 w - -',As predicted Black occupied c4 with his B inviting me to swap minor pieces and threatening to capture the pawn on b2.  I decided that the pawn on b2 could be abandoned to its fate in the interest of not delaying my attack any more.  I was also happy to trust my Ne5 to defend the Bd3 for the time being. So ...
308,7,42,2g5,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn1p/3pN1P1/2b2Q2/P1PB3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - -',I continued with my planned attack hoping to open attacking lines to Black's king not exactly at any cost but at least as quickly as I could.
309,7,43,2Qxg5,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn2/3pN1Q1/2b5/P1PB3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - -',Now my Q is diverted from defence of f2 and from attack on f7 but also has newly opened opportunities on the g and h files if I can bring a rook or two to bear on them.
310,7,44,2Nxd3,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2pn2/3p2Q1/8/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - -',This recapture seemed to catch my opponent by surprise (perhaps he'd overlooked it and thought he was winning  piece) but it works rather well.  OK the N is no longer attacking f7 but I was still some way from being able to make that work.  From d3 the N defends both b2 and f2 enabling me to move my K off the g-file (and Black's Queen's diagonal) and prepare a battery against g7.
311,7,45,2Ne4,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2p3/3p2Q1/4n3/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 w - -',Black's N freed from defensive duty occupies a threatening stronghold attacking Qg5 pawns on c3 and f2 and potential tricks on g3 and d2.
312,7,46,2Qf4,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/pq2p3/3p4/4nQ2/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - -',So I returned to f4 bolstering the defence of f2 while reasserting the threat to f7 if I could bring up another attacker.
313,7,47,2Qc7,b'2rr2k1/1pq2pp1/p3p3/3p4/4nQ2/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 w - -',Black offers to swap Queens which would accentuate his pawn advantage (and much better pawn structure).
314,7,48,3Qh4,b'2rr2k1/1pq2pp1/p3p3/3p4/4n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 b - -',Now I saw potential on the h-file while maintaining over-defence of f2.
315,7,49,3Qd6,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/p2qp3/3p4/4n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R1K1 w - -',Not quite sure of the purpose of this I had to think again carefully.  I presume that Black was contemplating ...d4 followed by a rook swap on the c-file.  The N would have to move first though so I had another window of opportunity to prepare my attack.
316,7,50,3Kh1,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/p2qp3/3p4/4n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R2K b - -',! I like this move.  Now I planned to play Rg1 and develop serious threats against Black's King.  I just had to watch out for N checks and forks.
317,7,51,3Rc4,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p2qp3/3p4/2r1n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R1R2K w - -',This appears to threaten Nxf2+ with a discovered attack on White's Q but it doesn't yet work because the Q covers f2.
318,7,52,3Reg1,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p2qp3/3p4/2r1n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R3RK b - -',So I ignored Black's manoeuvres and proceeded with my plan.
319,7,53,3f6,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p4/2r1n2Q/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R3RK w - -',?! Interesting ... I think Black wanted to free his Q from the duty of defending the Rd8 while also preparing ...g5 attacking my Q but this weakens the kingside pawns and White will be able to safely ignore the pawn attack because of the pin on the g-file.
320,7,54,3Rg4,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p4/2r1n1RQ/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R4K b - -',Now I pin Black's N against his R and prepare doubling my rooks on the g-file.  At last I felt my attack was coming together.
321,7,55,3Ng5,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p2n1/2r3RQ/P1PN3P/1P3P2/2R4K w - -',"The pin on the N was not effective since after 34. Rxc4? dxc4 35. Qxc4 Qxd3!
The N now obstructs the g-file and threatens a fork from f3 if I try Rg1.  Also Black threatens to swap on g4."
322,7,56,3f4,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p2n1/2r2PRQ/P1PN3P/1P6/2R4K b - f3',I throw my weakling f-pawn into the fray to reopen the g-file and remove the threats of Rxg4 and Nf3 with a fork.
323,7,57,3Ne4,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p4/2r1nPRQ/P1PN3P/1P6/2R4K w - -',Black returns his N to its lovely outpost but now I can double rooks with impunity.
324,7,58,3Rcg1,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p2qpp2/3p4/2r1nPRQ/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK b - -',My first real threat.
325,7,59,3Rd7,b'6k1/1p1r2p1/p2qpp2/3p4/2r1nPRQ/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK w - -',Black defends along the seventh rank.
326,7,60,3Qh5,b'6k1/1p1r2p1/p2qpp2/3p3Q/2r1nPR1/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK b - -',! A dual purpose move threatening to attack down the h-file and also to check from e8 when if Black interposed his Q on f8 the Rd7 would hang loose.  If Black moved the King instead Rh4 would deliver mate.
327,7,61,3g5,b'6k1/1p1r4/p2qpp2/3p2pQ/2r1nPR1/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK w - g6',Supported by the pawn on f6 and the N on e4 this pawn appears to obstruct the battery on the g-file while giving the King breathing space but I could now see definite mating potential on the h-file.
328,7,62,3Rh4,b'6k1/1p1r4/p2qpp2/3p2pQ/2r1nP1R/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK b - -',! Exploiting the pin from g1 I prepare either 38. Qh8+ or 38. Qe8+ or 38. Qg6+ depending on Black's reply.
329,7,63,3Rg7,b'6k1/1p4r1/p2qpp2/3p2pQ/2r1nP1R/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK w - -',Allows the winning combination but I'm not sure what else Black could have done.
330,7,64,3Qe8+,b'4Q1k1/1p4r1/p2qpp2/3p2p1/2r1nP1R/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK b - -',Now I couldn't see a mate but I could see an opportunity to win Q for R with a winning game.

333,7,67,4Qxf8+,b'5Q1k/1p4r1/p3pp2/3p2p1/2r1nP2/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK b - -',For the first time in the game I'm materially ahead but the game still has to be won as Black's pawns and N are quite formidable especially if he can coordinate his rooks effectively.
334,7,68,4Kh7,b'5Q2/1p4rk/p3pp2/3p2p1/2r1nP2/P1PN3P/1P6/6RK w - -',Forced (40. ...Rg8 41. Qh6#)

410,10,0,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Patzer opening.  It is generally advised to avoid getting the queen out early in the game unless one is playing against lower rated beginners.
411,10,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Black must defend against QxPf7#.  This is not difficult to manage though.
412,10,2,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp3n/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Pg6 also works and forces the queen to move.
413,10,3,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp3n/4p2Q/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',White eyes BxNh6.  If black plays PxBh6 white wins.  Black should be able to defend the knight with Pg6.
414,10,4,a5,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp3n/pp2p2Q/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq a6',Qc7 might have been better.  White essentially gets a free knight here.
415,10,5,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/5p1p/2pp2pB/pp2p2Q/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',...or maybe not.  Pushing the queen--the bishop trade can wait.  Black has h4 and h3 covered.

419,11,0,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Patzer opening.  (Your opponent is looking toward the four move check mate--will come out with Bc4 if you let him).
420,11,1,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',"Nc6 is the most typical response for black.  It defends the pawn and although it does not discourage Bc4 black ends up chasing the white queen while developing his pieces with 3...Pg6 (in response to Bc4).

Putting the queen out on the field early is not bad when playing lower rated amateurs.  It is a powerful piece.  But the move is considered risky.  White's leading responses all do well."
421,11,2,g6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5qp1/4p2Q/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',With this move black loses Pe5.  I like Pd6 which protects Pe5 from white's marauding queen.
422,11,3,Be7,b'rnb1k1nr/ppppbp1p/5qp1/4Q3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black might have been better off trading queens.  Now white can play QxPc7 putting black down a second pawn early in the game.
423,11,4,Na6,b'r1b1k1nr/ppQpbp1p/n4qp1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',While this is a decent move for black white might respond with BxNa6.  Every trade now benefits white.  This trade doesn't double blacks pawns though since black can reply with QxBa6.
424,11,5,Qb3,b'r3k1nr/pp1bbp1p/n2p1qp1/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"White might better play Bb5 forcing black to defend Bd7.  BxBb5 QxB+ black cannot interpose and must move the king followed by QxPb7.  While this is generally considered a ""poisoned"" pawn white cleans up Pa7 or Na6 too."
425,11,6,Be6,b'r3k1nr/pp2bp1p/n2pbqp1/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',This is a hollow threat.  White moved the queen on the b file to swallow Pb7.
426,11,7,Rb8,b'1r2k1nr/pQ2bp1p/n2pbqp1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQk -',This doesn't save the knight of course but black could at least recoup one point with Rc8.  QxNa6 RxPc2.  On second thought that isn't any good either as white would move Qa4+ and seize Rc2.  The white queen has become a gnawing cancer in black's side.
427,11,8,1Qxa6,b'1r2k1nr/p3bp1p/Q2pbqp1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQk -',QxPa7 must be coming up pretty quick.
428,11,9,1Rxb2,b'4k1nr/p3bp1p/Q2pbqp1/8/4P3/5N2/PrPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQk -',While this might look like a bad move at first blush it is actually quite good.  Black would end up trading a pawn bishop AND rook for black's rook provided white takes the bait.  White's best response here appears to be Pe5.  Black must then move the queen giving white a cheap rook.
429,11,10,1Nc3,b'4k1nr/p3bp1p/Q2pbqp1/8/4P3/2N2N2/PrPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQk -',RxPc2 will trap the black rook.

431,11,12,1Qa4,b'5knr/4bp1p/3pbqp1/8/Q3P3/2N2N2/P1rP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',I'm partial to Rb1 for white.  Sets up lots of good possibilities.  I wish I could see possibilities for black.  It is understandable white the white queen chose a4--she has her eye on wrecking Rc2.
432,11,13,1Rxc3,b'5knr/4bp1p/3pbqp1/8/Q3P3/2r2N2/P2P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Actually this is a great move for black.  PxRc3 and white loses the pawn with QxPc3+ AND the a rook.  I take back what I said earlier about the black rook being trapped.  Nice recover!  There is one small fly in the ointment though--Bb2.  This pins the black rook against the black queen.  Black can trade the rook for the bishop with Rc1+ RxRc1 QxBb2.  White can then kind of force a queen trade (all trades are white's advantage while white enjoys material) with Qd4.
433,11,14,Qb6,b'5knr/4bp1p/1q1pb1p1/8/Q3P3/5N2/P1RP1PPP/4KB1R w K -',I kind of like Qb1+ better.  White won't interpose the rook and Ke2 traps white's white bishop.
434,11,15,2Rc1,b'6nr/4bpkp/q2p2p1/8/4P3/5N2/3P1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Qc1 seems like a better idea.  So long as the white rook remains on black's 8th rank the knight is pinned (against a rook swap) and white can pour more power onto the black side of the board.
435,11,16,Rc8,b'2r5/4bpk1/q2p2p1/4n2p/3NP3/2RP3P/5PP1/3Q1RK1 w - -',Although black is down only three points white wants to trade.

440,12,1,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Ok move.  Generally speaking this doesn't win a pawn because white generally takes back with 5.Nxe4  But not this time.  The question is why meaning why didn't he recapture?
441,12,2,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',The move is ok and develops something  But in answer to the question above: first wrecking_ball gives things away.  The reason being is that he'll give the opponent an opportunity and make one think that winning something is enough to have a noticeable.  But as we know winning something is generally not enough.  You also need the theory and the fundamentals like K safety and other things.  But the idea is that even if you have won something you need to still play accurately to maintain your advantages as otherwise you throw it away and suddenly find that the opponent has the advantage.  Often strong enough to win and that is exactly what wrecking_ball emphasizes and teaches by giving things away.  In fact that's one logic behind those Q sacs as we know about.  And often he does win because the opponent underestimates him after having won something like the Q.  The idea is like I said even in a winning position you still have to be careful and not become overly confident as it could spell disaster.  Second white will get that pawn back shortly so it doesn't actually lose anything.  But the idea behind the first reason is to give you something to think about in answer to why WB does so as it's an important concept to the theory and concepts as discussed in that club.  
442,12,3,Nd6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2nn4/1B2p3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',! Ok time to really get into it as that's how you learn.  So with it one might think or ask why Janet didn't 5...exd4 because it achieves liquidation exchanges when ahead with 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Qxd4.  Well that isn't so and 5...exd4?? is a blunder because white would immediately answer with 6.Qe2! actually winning a piece by directly pinning the N.  So ...PXP isn't good.  Instead this is the best move because black avoids that nasty pin.  And it wins back the pawn right away.
443,12,4,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2Bn4/4p3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So it starts with this move. 
444,12,5,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2pn4/4p3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now you might think that these doubled pawns aren't good.  First it's toward the center so it can't be that bad.  Second as I learned black still has plenty of opportunities to deploy and mobilize her pieces.  In fact it will make it that much easier since her LSB can get right out.  So overall being forced to double those pawns really wasn't bad at all.
445,12,6,dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2pn4/4P3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',!! And this is where white regains his pawn and at the same time gains time with this move.  Now that brigadecommander needs to protect her piece this gives TA the time he needs to come up with another plan.  In addition there's even more to this then meets the eye because this is part of the plan as I will explain more on my next comment.  But that is why I deem it worthy of the double exclamation points.  
446,12,7,Qxd8+,b'r1bQkb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',And this was the plan with 7.dxe5  Instead of developing which I would've considered what he played believe it or not is exactly what I would've done.  As now black has lost the opportunity to castle and this kind of capture is known from my experience to expose the K.  Of course not right away but eventually as there is now a weakness which is quite vulnerable to attack.  And that was the idea behind 7.dxe5!!
447,12,8,Kxd8,b'r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',As we know this was how he had to recapture so the move was forced.  That's why black can no longer castle.  Even though it's early to call I'd say that with best play white should win this game especially given his rating.  Taking away castling rights like this is how I've won several games coincidentally.
448,12,9,Rd1+,b'r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 b - -',Also what I would've played.
449,12,10,Ke8,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 w - -',! Best as any thing else loses a piece due to the e pawn.  But white kept that in mind which is a reason that he played 9.Rd1+!
450,12,11,1Nc3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',To develop another piece.  
451,12,12,1Be6,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/4Pn2/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',The same could be said for black.
452,12,13,1Ng5,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/4PnN1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',So if black's not threatening anything like a mate or loss of material why did white disobey the guideline and move the same piece more then once?  Well the reason is that and it's something else he teaches is that while opening guidelines are generally important you don't have to follow them to win or do well.  There was a game where I broke all the guidelines and won though it should've been lost with best play because of how badly my K was exposed plus being down material.  But the idea is that just as important as the opening guidelines general opening principles is theory.  And if you don't understand about theory even with better opening or even being way ahead in that department and actually having rooks connected and the center completely controlled whereas the other still has two or three pieces to develop you can't defeat him.  And he has proven it to be true.  In fact that's where I got the idea after a lucky win to annotate a game where I didn't follow the basic guidelines yet won after so many told me that I lost previous game and did not do well because of my failure to open properly.  In it he specifically commented on what people say that because you didn't follow the guidelines you lost and he said that's weak because of theory fundamentals and concepts which also play an essential role.
453,12,14,1Bc8,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4PnN1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',?? According to the post game analysis and WB this is the only inaccurate move from black.  Unfortunately this loses however.  It's a blunder now the analysis shows why but what WB is even worse then why it's listed as an inaccuracy.  I don't what the best move was but what the analysis would actually be an illegal because they suggested 11...Be7  But the reason they classify as a blunder is because of 12.Ne2 Be7 13.Nf3 Be6 14.Nf4 Bc4 15.g4 Nh4 16.Nxh4 Bxh4 17.Rd4 Bb5 18.Nh5 g5 19.f4 gxf4 20.Bxf4  But as noted WB has bigger plans.  And one thing worth noting is that after this move white calculates this win.  I know because it was indirectly implied in the Deeper Chess Theory Club.  And the thing is that despite not being a GM as per what he said he can occasionally calculate 60 moves in advance which is very impressive.  So that's where it generally only takes one mistake to make or break against a player like TA.  
454,12,15,1Nge4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4Pn2/4N3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',Already starting the aggressive plan as noted earlier.
455,12,16,1Be6,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/4Pn2/4N3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',Ok getting a piece into play and preparing to castle which is always a good idea.
456,12,17,1h3,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/4Pn2/4N3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',In general this would not be a good move since he developed that h pawn before getting the last piece out and opening up a pawn right near the K.  But this is an exception as it's part of his winning plan.  And one thing to add is that I've seen TA win with his K exposed.  He showed a game a game where it was beyond exposed but still won.
457,12,18,1h5,b'r3kb1r/ppp2pp1/2p1b3/4Pn1p/4N3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 w - h6',! The idea behind this is to prevent white from taking that B and forcing her to double pawns.   However better was to castle with 13...0-0-0 since K safety is very important. 
458,12,19,1Ng5,b'r3kb1r/ppp2pp1/2p1b3/4PnNp/8/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',So white comes back with that aggressive move.  
459,12,20,1Rh6,b'r3kb2/ppp2pp1/2p1b2r/4PnNp/8/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',But black won't have to double up when if white plays 15.Nxe6 and that is why 13...h5! was good.  However this is where I as noted would've castled Q side once and for all for the reasons outlined earlier.
460,12,21,1Ne2,b'r3kb2/ppp2pp1/2p1b2r/4PnNp/8/7P/PPP1NPP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',I don't why he played this.  Instead I would've played 15.Nge4 and when black gets the R out of harm's way I'd bring out the last piece as white.  In fact completetion of development is the only grounds that I would even do the discover attack.
461,12,22,1Bd5,b'r3kb2/ppp2pp1/2p4r/3bPnNp/8/7P/PPP1NPP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',To avoid exchanging N for B since in general a bishop is worth more.
462,12,23,1Nf4,b'r3kb2/ppp2pp1/2p4r/3bPnNp/5N2/7P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',Supports what I said a move ago as white is still going or that exchange.
463,12,24,1Rd8,b'3rkb2/ppp2pp1/2p4r/3bPnNp/5N2/7P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',! But before black does not allow it.  And it is the best way to avoid the exchange as any other means of protection would lose a piece due to the e pawn. 
464,12,25,1e6,b'3rkb2/ppp2pp1/2p1P2r/3b1nNp/5N2/7P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',! Like I said earlier as it does lose a pawn TA will often give things away but there's a strategy and a lesson to behind it.  You still have to be careful and play accurately even after you have won something.
465,12,26,1fxe6,b'3rkb2/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3b1nNp/5N2/7P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',So without further a due black takes.
466,12,27,1c4,b'3rkb2/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3b1nNp/2P2N2/7P/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 b - c3',So white plays here.  Now in general it wins a piece since the LSB is jammed but not this time.
467,12,28,1Be7,b'3rk3/ppp1b1p1/2p1p2r/3b1nNp/2P2N2/7P/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',Instead black responds here so that when white takes the B black takes back and it's an exchange.  However we are now starting notice white's advantages increase since that B is going to be exchanged for the N as noted earlier.
468,12,29,1cxd5,b'3rk3/ppp1b1p1/2p1p2r/3P1nNp/5N2/7P/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',As I mentioned.
469,12,30,1Bxg5,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3P1nbp/5N2/7P/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',Like I also said white's advantages are becoming more noticeable.
470,12,31,2Re1,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3P1nbp/5N2/7P/PP3PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',One idea is to attack the center with the R as attacking is also a way to contest the center.  The other plan is so that white can win back a pawn.
471,12,32,2Bxf4,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3P1n1p/5b2/7P/PP3PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',But as we expect black does not make it easy because she takes.
472,12,33,2Bxf4,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2p1p2r/3P1n1p/5B2/7P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',So does white.
473,12,34,2Rg6,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2p1p1r1/3P1n1p/5B2/7P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',This time to prevent white from taking on e6 but Joe has other plans as we know.
474,12,35,2dxc6,b'3rk3/ppp3p1/2P1p1r1/5n1p/5B2/7P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',So he takes and the idea is to take advantage of those doubled pawns since he did this on c6.
475,12,36,2bxc6,b'3rk3/p1p3p1/2p1p1r1/5n1p/5B2/7P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',So she takes.  But worth noting is that this was the only place to recapture so Janet remains with doubled pawns which was one of white's plans.
476,12,37,2Re4,b'3rk3/p1p3p1/2p1p1r1/5n1p/4RB2/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 b - -',The idea is to double up on the e file which is why white played.  So the only question that remains is how long will it take before that happens.
477,12,38,2Rd5,b'4k3/p1p3p1/2p1p1r1/3r1n1p/4RB2/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - -',I don't know why black this.  Her N was not in danger because even if 24.Re5 black can still play this and protect the N.  But with this move white wins back a pawn for now.  Instead I would've played 23...Rd7 to protect the d pawn.
478,12,39,Kd7,b'8/p1Bk2p1/2p1p1r1/3r1n1p/4R3/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - -',! Normally not good when you don't want to move that K before the endgame as where it's generally exposed.  But this is an exception and a very good move mobilizing that K and preparing it for action.  So there is a plan behind this.
479,12,40,2Bb8,b'1B6/p2k2p1/2p1p1r1/3r1n1p/4R3/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 b - -',Keeping his B safe.
480,12,41,2a5,b'1B6/3k2p1/2p1p1r1/p2r1n1p/4R3/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - a6',Also possible was 25...a6 but I like this move better as the pawn advances further and it becomes a passed pawn which by definition can be stopped.  So it's really a matter of time before that happens.
481,12,42,2Rc1,b'1B6/3k2p1/2p1p1r1/p2r1n1p/4R3/7P/PP3PP1/2R3K1 b - -',To put pressure on the c6 pawn.
482,12,43,2Nd4,b'1B6/3k2p1/2p1p1r1/p2r3p/3nR3/7P/PP3PP1/2R3K1 w - -',To alleviate the pressure as you now have an added defender for the c file.
483,12,44,2Kh2,b'1B6/3k2p1/2p1p1r1/p2r3p/3nR3/7P/PP3PPK/2R5 b - -',To activate and mobilize his K.  While we're not quite at that phase yet it's getting close to an endgame.
484,12,45,2c5,b'1B6/3k2p1/4p1r1/p1pr3p/3nR3/7P/PP3PPK/2R5 w - -',Now the idea is to take the pressure off of the c file at once.
485,12,46,2Be5,b'8/3k2p1/4p1r1/p1prB2p/3nR3/7P/PP3PPK/2R5 b - -',Unlike before I have no idea why white played this.
486,12,47,2Nb5,b'8/3k2p1/4p1r1/pnprB2p/4R3/7P/PP3PPK/2R5 w - -',In my opinion this move was not necessary as the N was already protected.  But my guess is that black had other plans.  And she did so to prevent white from trying since the plan was Bd4 at some point and this move stops him from doing that.
487,12,48,2b3,b'8/3k2p1/4p1r1/pnprB2p/4R3/1P5P/P4PPK/2R5 b - -',A very good idea.  Normally I wouldn't have a clue as to why this was played.  But it makes sense because in this position Joe is achieving a solid pawn structure by connecting his a and b pawns.  And I learned all about this from TA/WB himself in the Deeper Chess Theory club as posted a very instructive video by a GM.  It gave you the idea of those solid pawn structures.
488,12,49,2Nd6,b'8/3k2p1/3np1r1/p1prB2p/4R3/1P5P/P4PPK/2R5 w - -',! Understandable as white was threatening 30.a4 which keeps those structures against the N.  And this move puts pressure right on the center.  
489,12,50,3Ree1,b'8/3k2p1/3np1r1/p1prB2p/8/1P5P/P4PPK/2R1R3 b - -',! Protecting it.  And now things are getting more and more interesting.
490,12,51,3Kc6,b'8/6p1/2knp1r1/p1prB2p/8/1P5P/P4PPK/2R1R3 w - -',I do not know why black played this.
491,12,52,3Kg1,b'8/6p1/2knp1r1/p1prB2p/8/1P5P/P4PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',But I do know what's happening for white.  As it turns out it is a WM waiting move to see what black will do next and then he'll go from there.
492,12,53,3Rd2,b'8/6p1/2knp1r1/p1p1B2p/8/1P5P/P2r1PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',Black's idea is to win that a pawn.
493,12,54,3a3,b'8/6p1/2knp1r1/p1p1B2p/8/PP5P/3r1PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',But white does not allow it.  As noted 32.a4 was also playable and this is how I would've moved to maintain that pawn chain.  But the problem though is that the b pawn is then blocked and can no longer move.  My guess is that TA is doing another WM and just waiting for the right opportunity to move that pawn again and make it quite dangerous.
494,12,55,3Kb6,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p1B2p/8/PP5P/3r1PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',I have no idea why she moved here but my guess was to prevent white from getting passed pawns on the a and b files.
495,12,56,3Kf1,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p1B2p/8/PP5P/3r1PP1/2R1RK2 b - -',But white is doing another WM in my opinion.  Worth noting that Joe does a lot of WM because the idea is that he's waiting for opportunities to arrive when the opponent has a weakness.  However waits until he figures out exactly what it is so that he can exploit it.
496,12,57,3Rd5,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1prB2p/8/PP5P/5PP1/2R1RK2 w - -',However I don't know what black is trying to accomplish here.  It could be a WM there but why move that R and then back again shortly after?  That is the question.
497,12,58,3Bb2,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1pr3p/8/PP5P/1B3PP1/2R1RK2 b - -',At first I didn't know why he played this.  In this position where black to take that B white certainly would've won the R in exchange.  But forget about systems or anything else like that.  In this particular position his B is worth more then the R's as right now it has potential to do damage so he's not going to exchange his B even for her R.
498,12,59,3Rd2,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p4p/8/PP5P/1B1r1PP1/2R1RK2 w - -',That is proven here where Janet decides to put pressure right on the B.
499,12,60,3Bc3,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p4p/8/PPB4P/3r1PP1/2R1RK2 b - -',Of course Joe protects it with a counterattack.
500,12,61,3Rd3,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p4p/8/PPBr3P/5PP1/2R1RK2 w - -',But so does black with this move.
501,12,62,3a4,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p4p/P7/1PBr3P/5PP1/2R1RK2 b - -',To achieve that pawn chain.  But I would've played 36.Be5 because of what I mentioned earlier.
502,12,63,3h4,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p5/P6p/1PBr3P/5PP1/2R1RK2 w - -',My guess is that this is a WM as black intends to get a pawn chain.  First by moving the g R and then advancing that g pawn until it reaches the fifth rank.
503,12,64,3Re5,b'8/6p1/1k1np1r1/p1p1R3/P6p/1PBr3P/5PP1/2R2K2 b - -',To put pressure on the fifth rank.
504,12,65,3Nf5,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1p1Rn2/P6p/1PBr3P/5PP1/2R2K2 w - -',Of course black has a way out of that for now.
505,12,66,3Bb2,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1p1Rn2/P6p/1P1r3P/1B3PP1/2R2K2 b - -',To keep that B safe again.  
506,12,67,3Rxb3,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1p1Rn2/P6p/1r5P/1B3PP1/2R2K2 w - -',Of course it loses a pawn but that B needed the protection and once again the loss of material against WB is not that big of a deal because he has more ways to compensate then it might appear.
507,12,68,3Ba1,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1p1Rn2/P6p/1r5P/5PP1/B1R2K2 b - -',Still keeping that B protected.
508,12,69,3Rb4,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1p1Rn2/Pr5p/7P/5PP1/B1R2K2 w - -',To win another pawn.
509,12,70,4Rexc5,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1R2n2/Pr5p/7P/5PP1/B1R2K2 b - -',But this time white exchanges instead of giving up another pawn.  Plus he is doubling up which as we know two R's on the same file is known to be quite dangerous.
510,12,71,4Rxa4,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1R2n2/r6p/7P/5PP1/B1R2K2 w - -',While still putting pressure on his B.
511,12,72,4Be5,b'8/6p1/1k2p1r1/p1R1Bn2/r6p/7P/5PP1/2R2K2 b - -',The idea still remains to protect that B.
512,12,73,4Ne7,b'8/4n1p1/1k2p1r1/p1R1B3/r6p/7P/5PP1/2R2K2 w - -',I don't know why black played this.
513,12,74,4Bc7+,b'8/2B1n1p1/1k2p1r1/p1R5/r6p/7P/5PP1/2R2K2 b - -',! Happens to be a very serious check.  As while it might not appear it's going to leave black with problems.
514,12,75,4Ka6,b'8/2B1n1p1/k3p1r1/p1R5/r6p/7P/5PP1/2R2K2 w - -',I am actually surprised that black did not play 42...Ka7
515,12,76,4Rb1,b'8/2B1n1p1/k3p1r1/p1R5/r6p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',! And that's because of what he played.
516,12,77,4e5,b'8/2B1n1p1/k5r1/p1R1p3/r6p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',I don't know why she played this.  Instead my next move would've been 43...Ka7 to prevent white from playing 44.Rb6+ which that move would be forced anyway but she would be in check automatically gaining tempo for white.
517,12,78,4Rxe5,b'8/2B1n1p1/k5r1/p3R3/r6p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',As noted I would've considered placing black in check with 44.Rb6+  However I most likely would've played this as the move is better.  Getting a pawn back and putting pressure right on that e N in return.  The check could always wait until later.
518,12,79,4Nc6,b'8/2B3p1/k1n3r1/p3R3/r6p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',! The best.  Also possible was 44...Nc8 or 44...Ng8 but this puts pressure right on the e R.
519,12,80,4Reb5,b'8/2B3p1/k1n3r1/pR6/r6p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',Planning a nasty check.  And Joe can do this two ways.  The first idea is to check with 46.Rb6+

521,12,82,4Rb8,b'1R6/2B3p1/k5r1/p7/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',So this is his second plan.  It's now strategy as opposed to tactic because he's preparing for his next move.
522,12,83,4Rc6,b'1R6/2B3p1/k1r5/p7/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',Still trying to get that B.
523,12,84,4Ra8+,b'R7/2B3p1/k1r5/p7/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',But this is the check I was also alluding to which was also the idea behind 45.Reb5
524,12,85,4Kb5,b'R7/2B3p1/2r5/pk6/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',47...Kb7 was also an option.  In fact this is what I would've played if I were black.
525,12,86,4Bd8,b'R2B4/6p1/2r5/pk6/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',Still doing what it takes to protect the B.
526,12,87,4Rc4,b'R2B4/6p1/8/pk6/rnr4p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',I don't know why she played this.
527,12,88,4Ra7,b'3B4/R5p1/8/pk6/rnr4p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',But white's intention's are very good.  It isn't just the pawn but what he's doing is putting pressure on the seventh rank.  One thing worth noting as I learned in an annotation that a R on the seventh is quite powerful and dangerous.  I learned that in my game against chesskingdom64
528,12,89,4g6,b'3B4/R7/6p1/pk6/rnr4p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',To protect.  Although I really like 49...g5 for the pawn chain as noted earlier this time connected pawns would be a mistake.  That's because playing would automatically lose a pawn after 50.Bxg5
529,12,90,5Rg7,b'3B4/6R1/6p1/pk6/rnr4p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 b - -',! But with this move is going to win a pawn one or another.  That is either the g pawn or the h pawn.  As they say one will fall. 
530,12,91,5Rc6,b'3B4/6R1/2r3p1/pk6/rn5p/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',And it is going to be the h pawn.
531,12,92,Kc4,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p7/rnk4B/7P/5PP1/1R3K2 w - -',Going for the opposition.
532,12,93,5Rc1+,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p7/rnk4B/7P/5PP1/2R2K2 b - -',But it is too little too late for that.
533,12,94,5Nc2,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p7/r1k4B/7P/2n2PP1/2R2K2 w - -',?? Blunder.  As I recently learned from Jack when the opponent places you in check it's usually not a good idea to get out of it by interceding with a piece.  Meaning moving a piece as opposed to the K.  Instead it's better to use the K.  And this move allows white to win a N and get a skewer with another which wins a R.  But what he's about to play is worse then that.  
534,12,95,5Bg5,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p5B1/r1k5/7P/2n2PP1/2R2K2 b - -',Therefore I would've played 53.Rxc2 if I were white.  But I understand why he played this instead.  And with things are actually worse for black then it appears.
535,12,96,5Ra2,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p5B1/2k5/7P/r1n2PP1/2R2K2 w - -',Protecting the N for now.  But it is going to fall rather soon as we're about to see.
536,12,97,5g4,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p5B1/2k3P1/7P/r1n2P2/2R2K2 b - g3',Getting his own pawn chain.
537,12,98,5Kb3,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p5B1/6P1/1k5P/r1n2P2/2R2K2 w - -',Using her K as a weapon since it is guarding that N and R which makes it impossible to take for now.
538,12,99,5Rb1+,b'8/6R1/2r3p1/p5B1/6P1/1k5P/r1n2P2/1R3K2 b - -',At first I was trying to figure out why black resigned here so I did HW on it.  The reason why is that while it would take a while even with best play from Janet white has a mating patter against black.  It's not definitely how white would mate but this is an alternative solution meaning one way to do this.  So something like 55...Ka4  56.Ke2 Rc5 57.Bd2 Ka3 58.Ra4 Nd4+ 59.Kd3 Nf3 60.Bxa5 Ka4 61.Bd8+ Ra5 62.Rxa5#  Even if that's not how white has ways to mate with no way out of it for black.  As a result Janet resigned.  Overall I really enjoyed studying this game from wrecking_ball.  But the moral is that you have to be very careful especially against a stronger player.  Even if you play super well against someone like WB it only takes one mistake to go wrong which is often the case.  Something like this also happened in a game between Tom and a master.  And Tom was a piece ahead and had a won game.  But he made one mistake and that was enough for that master to get his advantages back and win the game interestingly enough.
539,13,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My club mates know full well that I am a master at the caro-kann. So no doubt they played 1.d4 to avoid it. However can they avoid playing into the benoni system which is another favorite of mine?
540,13,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My whole idea here was to play with their head and keep them guessing as to what my ultimate goals were. Truth be told I was heading by way of transposition to the benoni at this time but later on I had to switch my plans to a grunfield system. One of the hallmarks of a master is to be flexible and don't tip your hand too quickly. All ways play moves that keep your opponent guessing as too what your planning. Having said that it is not a license to play stupid and unsound moves. 1...c5 though off beat is logical and sound because it challenges the centre and creates an immediate threat to win a pawn. Whereas a stupid move like 1...a5 does absolutely nothing. 
541,13,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Perfectly playable for white is 2. dxc5 expecting 2...Qa5+ winning the pawn back. The idea of 2.d5 and why I think it is better is that it gives white long term strategic benefits. Whereas in the 2. dxc5 white is simply exchanging a center pawn for a wing pawn which may not be so good later on. 
542,13,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',One consequence of the white pawn on d5 is that the long dark diagonal is free for black to use. It will be almost impossible for white to shut out the black bishop. Strategically my plan is to fight for control of e5 and d5. The first step is to gain control of e5 in order to ensure a draw. It is important to note that in fianchettoed positions like this one it is critical for black to maintain the balance on the central dark squares. This is why you will often see black try to exchange his LSB for white's f3 knight. As doing so limits white's ability to fight for e5. 
543,13,4,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2pP4/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',All too often I see lower rated players play ...g6 without the immediate ...Bg7. This is wrong! if you play ...g6 then you should play ...Bg7. Otherwise what is the point of ...g6! 
544,13,5,d6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In such positions black often benefits from delaying the development of the kings knight. In this game I intend to get my knight into the game via e7 or h6. The idea is to plan and prepare for f7-f5 attacking white's weak e-pawn. Of course that is a long ways a way from now. 
545,13,6,Be2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bd3 is much more popular these days as it is believed that white has nothing to fear from a potential ...c5-c4 by black. However again white(the club) chooses the path of long term gain over immediate return.  Which in my books is the best way to play chess. 
546,13,7,e6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3pp1p1/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An almost necessary move that attacks white's center and gives black room to complete his king side development. Which is all part of my master plan to create a king side pawn storm. But for now I am following through with my plan of keeping my card close to my chest. For all my opponents may know are that I maybe expecting 6.c4 with the hope of transposing to favorable benoni systems. If 6. dxe6 then 6...Bxe6 give black the strong active bishop pair.  
547,13,8,exd5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pp4/2P1P3/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',forced
548,13,9,exd5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',now white avoids the benoni system at the cost of a strategic disadvantage in the center. However what white gets if he can use it is a long term space advantage. 
549,13,10,Nh6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p2pn/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here I was hoping to surprise my club mates again as surely ...Nf6 is better right! Well they are probably right. As there is the possibility that the knight can get shut out on h6. However I was dreaming of two knight standing side by side on e5 and f5! And at the bare minimum a powerful knight on f5 working beautifully with the DSB on g7.    
550,13,11,Bf4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2pn/2pP4/2P2B2/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',A tricky move that hinders my ultimate plans of a knight on e5. Not only that the defense of d6 can be a bit tricky to handle for unprepared black players. I of course am very adept at defending d6.

First it has the direct threat of BxN giving me greater control of e5 as stated at the beginning. Second ...Re8 allows white to play Qd2 forcing the premature ...Nf5. Why premature because the knight can be kicked with the likes of a prepared g4 and saddles black with a bad bishop on c8. 
552,13,13,Nf5,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP1n2/2P2Bb1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Now that ...Bg4 has been played I do not have to worry about a bad bishop on c8. These little details are what masters think about. Had I played ...Re8 white can force black to play ...Nf5 hindering his LSB development. 
553,13,14,1Bxf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP1n2/2P2B2/2N2B1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White gains the strategic advantage of the bishop pair which may be important later on. However right now the position favor knights as the center is closed and the position is getting congested. Also note that white has played h3 which may seem insignificant but to a master a small pawn move in front of the enemy king may be all he/she needs to deal a decisive blow. 
554,13,15,1Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP1n2/2P2B2/2N2B1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Rooks belong on open files.

Of course I had seen this threat all the way back at move 9. Which is why I played 11....Bxf3 and ...Re8 so that I can interpose my bishop on e5. Directly meeting the threat head on! Also at the same time I am thinking that there is a possibility of ...Nd5 followed by ...f5 with tempo. But I am getting ahead of myself. 
556,13,17,1Qd2,b'rn1qr1k1/pp3p1p/3p2p1/2pPbn2/2P1NB2/5B1P/PP1Q1PP1/R4RK1 b - -',14. Bxe5 is met with ...Rxe5 with a slight advantage to black.

It prevents any future possibilities of  white exchanging his bad light bishop for black's strong knight. Second it is the infant step of a long series of small pawn moves on the king side that set the stage of a spectacular finish.

The idea is to draw away a center pawn from the center thereby creating a weakness on d5. I willingly go down a pawn(albeit the pawn is a double pawn) to force white to play defense.

The position is very dynamic and increasing in complexity. Which favors the stronger player.

705,18,19,Qe7,b'6k1/4q1p1/6bp/1B3p2/P1P2b2/1PB4P/5PP1/3Q3K w - -',Well now I have a losing endgame with an unusual four bishops + queens formation.

711,18,25,Qd2+,b'8/P5pk/8/1B2B1b1/2P1b3/1P3pPP/3q3K/Q7 w - -',Right for this move. Scratch all little advantage (of plausible) from a desperate position sac even more (leave white go after the promotion and almost get it... and look to the importance of my c6 pawn...

715,19,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3.... e6! the Icelandic gambit an awesome gambit with great attacking lines for black and white has to defend real secure to keep his pawn up and don't lose material.
716,19,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',He does however not accept and with Nc3 I will start the trade.
717,19,5,Qe2+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/2N5/PP1PQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',an in between check that in my opinion only allows me to develop my bishop early.

Qd7 also leads to Qxb7 and the loss of a rook as well. Bd7 leads to Qxd5 losing my knight and so the only decent option was...
720,19,8,Nd7,b'r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4b3/1Q1n4/8/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Nd7 'sacrificing' the knight at d5 to counter with 8.... c6 forking knight and queen so I win the knight back.
721,19,9,Qxb7,b'r2qkb1r/pQ1n1ppp/2p1b3/3N4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Now white is a pawn ahead but as you will notice taking the pawn on b7 will prove once more poisonous.
722,19,10,1Qa6,b'r2qkb1r/p2n1ppp/Q1p5/3b4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',That or d4 were his only moves as Nc5 locks the queen (10. Nf3 Nc5 11.Qb4 Nd3+ and the queen is mine).
723,19,11,1Qe7+,b'r3kb1r/p2nqppp/Q1p5/3b4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',This was practically forced as I can't allow white to play Qe2+ himself as that would've lead to queentrade which I have to prevent! He now has two options being 11.Qe2 and 11.Ne2 (as 11.Be2 leads to 11.... Bxg2 winning the rook)
724,19,12,1Ne2,b'r3kb1r/p2nqppp/Q1p5/3b4/8/8/PP1PNPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',He chose Ne2 which in my opinion is the least good I would've opted for Qe2. And thus now I unleash my final blow:

I would've taken the knight on b3 to get the active knight and bishop back for my queen.
730,19,18,1Nc3,b'r3kr2/p4ppp/2p5/3b4/4q3/1nN5/PP1P1PPP/R1BK1B1R b q -',Taking a tempo before attaking my knight it however bumps into the nice:

732,19,20,1Be2,b'r3kr2/p4ppp/2p5/3b4/6q1/1nN5/PP1PBPPP/R1BK3R b q -',so Be2 is the only option leading to

Black's choices are Kd8 in which case 12 Ne6+ picks off the black queen or Kd6 which drives the black king into the battlefield.  Actually Kd6 results with Ne4+ and again the black queen falls into darkness trampled beneath the white knight's hooves.
786,22,8,Na6,b'r4b1r/ppp1k3/n3Npp1/3PP3/2B3b1/3P1P2/PP4Pp/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Bg4 is worth more than Pc7.  BxNe6 would have defended against NxPc7.
787,22,9,Rh7,b'5b2/p6r/2BkN1p1/3Pp3/6P1/P2PBK2/1r4Pp/R6R w - -',?  I would have moved Pa6 or Pa5.  Rh7 permits NxBf8 for free.
788,22,10,2Nxf8,b'5N2/p6r/2Bk2p1/3Pp3/6P1/P2PBK2/1r4Pp/R6R b - -',Actually not for free.  I overlooked Rf7+.
789,22,11,2Rf7+,b'5N2/p4r2/2Bk2p1/3Pp3/6P1/P2PBK2/1r4Pp/R6R w - -',Here we expect Kg3 RnNf8 RxPh2.
790,23,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White opens things up with the Queen's Pawn a good opening.
791,23,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black goes on with what was their usual strategy. I don't like the openings I use anymore and this game was the beginning of change as this game will show my opening will be a bit different. Today though if I am black and white opens with the Queen's Pawn like this I will respond with the Queen's Pawn Keres Defense which is what this move is. 
792,23,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Well this is not part of the book thus the book ends. White is giving his pawns structure. 
793,23,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',At the moment this is still part of my original opening pattern. I don't think it's bad in this position.  
794,23,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White didn't take and I decided to do the same. Computer analysis says this was a mistake though. Well I don't agree with that. It says 3. exd5 was the best move. Maybe but taking is not always best and I felt it was better to not take in this case. 
795,23,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Well that I actually expected but it will be easy to protect the pawn.
796,23,6,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I could of played 4. Bd6 but I think connecting the pawns was best. 
797,23,7,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',For sure white is preparing to castle.
798,23,8,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Well this did go along with my old strategy. My opening is different when you look at the board but this was a wasted move. I realize that now but I didn't see that then.
799,23,9,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Castle as expected. 
800,23,10,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2npp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Computer analysis sees this as an inaccuracy. I agree with that it would of been better to play the best move Nf6 which would of allowed a little better development and better limited white's forces on the king-side. 
801,23,11,Nc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1nnpp1/3p3p/2pPp3/2N1P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White puts pressure on black's d6 pawn but that can be countered easily. 
802,23,12,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2npp1/1n1p3p/2pPp3/2N1P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Okay it's going pretty good for black right now the start isn't bad. For the most part black is actually countering white's moves pretty well and I am happy with that. 
803,23,13,Ne3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2npp1/1n1p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3BNN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White again does not take which I am not surprised with. By the looks of things he is going to advance his knights king-side. When this game was occurring then though I was expecting that thus I was not going to make it easy for white. 
804,23,14,1g3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I'd say this move was to keep my knight from advancing further. Good move by white for if he didn't play that I likely would of advanced my knight too but this move does allow me to advance my bishop. 
805,23,15,1Bh3,b'r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNPb/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Of course white will move his rook. That is really the best move to make. 
806,23,16,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNPb/PPP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',I am trying to advance king-side myself too as well as castle.

809,23,19,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/3p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/1P1BNNPb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I decide to get my knight out of there in case white plays 14. a5. I also feel I should get the other knight involved on the king-side as well. 
810,23,20,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/3p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/1P1BN1Pb/2PN1P1P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',White has plans for that knight on the queen-side. 
811,23,21,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/3p1nnp/2pPp3/P3P3/1P1BN1Pb/2PN1P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I plan to advance my other knight king-side here still. 
812,23,22,1Ndc4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/3p1nnp/2pPp3/P1N1P3/1P1BN1Pb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The d6 pawn again. At the stage though I am not concerned with that move for white wouldn't attack and give up some points at this stage.
813,23,23,1b6,b'r2q1rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p1nnp/2pPp3/P1N1P3/1P1BN1Pb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I decide to give my pawns more structure on the queen-side as well. 
814,23,24,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p1nnp/2pPpN2/P1N1P3/1P1B2Pb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Interesting white is quite focused on that d6 pawn. It is holding up white's center and removing that pawn would greatly help white. With this move though I am still not concerned for if white attacks with what he has now on d6 black will come out with the advantage thus I know white will not be taking anything yet. 
815,23,25,1Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p2np/2pPpN2/P1N1P1n1/1P1B2Pb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Finally after 10 moves the computer finally speaks up again. The computer analysis views this move as an inaccuracy and that the best move was 16. Qc7. At first I thought this was wrong but when you look at how white replies it makes sense. 
816,23,26,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p2np/2pPpN2/P1N1P1n1/1P1B1PPb/2P4P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',This is why the last move I made was an inaccuracy. I basically wasted a move because with the move white made black will now have to fall his knight back to f6 which was where that knight came from the move before. Again a wasted move but only an inaccuracy. 
817,23,27,1Bb2,b'r2q1rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p1nnp/2pPpN2/P1N1P3/1P1B1PPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',The board it tight and there haven't been any captures yet. I'm certain white has plans though. 
818,23,28,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/1p1p1nnp/2pPpN2/P1N1P3/1P1B1PPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',With a tight board this limits both sides options. It makes the moves I should make harder for me though. 
819,23,29,1Nce3,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/1p1p1nnp/2pPpN2/P3P3/1P1BNPPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',Pressure is taken off of the d6 pawn.
820,23,30,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/1p1p2np/2pPpN1n/P3P3/1P1BNPPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',Well you have to agree black has played great in this game far north of his rating. This is the move though that would begin black's downfall the first real mistake. It was hard for me to see why this was a mistake but the next move white makes will make it a bit clearer to me. The best move was Qc7 again. Earlier I didn't agree with that. Now though I totally agree with that for now that the one knight is positioned elsewhere on white's side the d6 pawn would be safe thus Qc7 would of been just fine. Things won't play out that way though. 
821,23,31,2Bb5,b'r4rk1/p2qbpp1/1p1p2np/1BpPpN1n/P3P3/1P2NPPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',This is why that last move was a mistake for white has a clear shot to my queen and white get's deeper in black's territory. White can also play Bc6 if he pleases. 
822,23,32,2Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/p3bpp1/1p1p2np/1BpPpN1n/P3P3/1P2NPPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',This was another mistake by black says the computer analysis. Qc7 was the best move not Qc8. I'm not totally sure why. With either move made by black white can play Bc6 and attack the a8 rook. 
823,23,33,2Bc6,b'r1q2rk1/p3bpp1/1pBp2np/2pPpN1n/P3P3/1P2NPPb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',As expected white attacks the rook.

826,23,36,2Nf6,b'1rq2rk1/p3bpp1/1pBp1nnp/2pPpN2/P3PP2/1P2N1Pb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',I played this to maybe attack the now unprotected e4 pawn. It likely was better to play 22. exf4. 
827,23,37,2fxe5,b'1rq2rk1/p3bpp1/1pBp1nnp/2pPPN2/P3P3/1P2N1Pb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',This move is where I made the wrong decision. 
828,23,38,2Nxe5,b'1rq2rk1/p3bpp1/1pBp1n1p/2pPnN2/P3P3/1P2N1Pb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',Blunder big blunder! I didn't see it but white had planned this. He moved his pawn up a move ago to attack the e5 pawn. I definitely should of took the pawn in response. This move was way bad though. 23. dxe5 was far better. Because I moved that crucial knight not only is the Bishop on e7 gone but that move will also take the queen. You can see what will happen I'm sure. I look at this now and I am shocked that I didn't see it! I think it is because I played my opponent pretty fast and I need a couple of minutes at least to make sure I made the right move. I didn't do that here thus white has won. I know better now though; don't make a move unless you are certain it is the right one.
829,23,39,2Nxe7+,b'1rq2rk1/p3Npp1/1pBp1n1p/2pPn3/P3P3/1P2N1Pb/1BP4P/R2QR1K1 b - -',Queen is gone.

I would originally say that this is a mistake by white but it's far from it. On top of the computer analysis saying nothing about this move this is actually a good move. Why? Well let the next moves explain. 
834,23,44,2gxf6,b'1r3r1k/p4p2/1pBp1p1p/2pP4/P3P3/1P2N1Pb/2P4P/R2QR1K1 w - -',At this stage doubled pawns is not a good thing especially now that white has a better path to black's king.

I agree with what others say about the computer analysis ""The computer is not always right"" and I certainly agree with that in this case. I do not see how this is a blunder at all. I'm thinking maybe the computer feels that white lost the quickest way to checkmate or something but white is just positioning himself for checkmate. It will be over in 3 moves anyway and I am certain the computer messed up here. "

No big mistakes and I stayed mostly even with white. Move 19 started the end though. If I played that position from move 19 today I would of easily countered. Once white took my queen though it was obviously over. I gave it my best but I wish I played the end way better. Despite the bad ending though I think this game was my best against Geniusacamel out of the 4 games. Well I'm glad to of had this game for I learned a few things I didn't know. I hope you all enjoyed this annotation! I will have another one soon game 3 at that.

995,27,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Out of my confort zone I played...
996,27,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2Pp4/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',...knowing that the pawn's defence won't have to be easy. 
997,27,3,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1PPp4/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq b3',Oh that's really brand new to me! Let's have fun!
998,27,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1PPp2b1/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I assumed that Nd7 was what he was prepared for. Now I am prepared to exchange the B for the N in order to release pressure against d4 that could then be supported by e5. In the meanwhile I'll had to stand for he attack on the white squares which I am confident I can do provided I won't lose d4 in the process. 
999,27,5,Ne5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4N3/1PPp2b1/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This knight is not actually threatening nothing but c3 and it was foreseen. 
1000,27,6,b5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/1P2N2b/Q1Pp4/8/P2PPPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',The e4 pawn is not defended after my next move but it is not threatened either. Even without the bishop my defences should hold since the N e5 will be threatened. 
1001,27,7,Nxc6,b'r3kbnr/ppq1pppp/2n5/4N2b/Q1Pp4/8/P2PPPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',No white pawns or lsb in sight to threat my knight and his is still under threat.

1003,27,9,Ba3,b'r3kbnr/p1q1pppp/2p5/7b/Q1Pp4/B7/P2PPPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',White is pressing me hard. I'm not advised to move the e pawn and lose the castling rights. 
1004,27,10,Nf6,b'r3kb1r/p1q1pppp/2p2n2/7b/Q1Pp4/B7/P2PPPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',So I develop the other minor piece hoping for a better chance. e4 - incredibly - is not threatened yet.

1006,27,12,1Nd7,b'r3kb1r/p1qnpppp/2p5/7b/Q1Pp4/B5P1/P2PPP1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Nb6 would unpin the c pawn supporting a sure c5 from black's side.

1009,27,15,1Bh3,b'2r1kb1r/p1qnpppp/2p5/7b/Q1Pp4/B5PB/P2PPP1P/RN2K2R b KQk -',? I would say since it allows my next move. I recognize white's wise judgement in not playing c5 but on the other side the pressure on c6 was his best chance. 
1010,27,16,1Qa6,b'2r1kb1r/p1q1pppp/Qnp5/7b/2Pp4/B5PB/P2PPP1P/RN2K2R b KQk -',I have to be very very careful now.

1026,27,32,2Bxc5,b'5rk1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/1rb1p2b/Q1Np4/B2P2P1/P3PPBP/R3K2R w KQ -',...the pointless B move by whie overlooked this simple but stunning move. White should have played Nd6 anyway with complicated tactics.

1030,27,36,Rxd5,b'5rk1/p1q2ppp/2p5/3rp2b/Q1Np4/3P2P1/P3PP1P/1R2K2R w K -',Very neatly black has a pawn and the edge now. 
1031,27,37,2Rb2,b'5rk1/p1q2ppp/2p5/3rp2b/Q1Np4/3P2P1/PR2PP1P/4K2R b K -',White misses some tempoes and they will make my lsb to return to action. 
1032,27,38,2f5,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3rpp1b/Q1Np4/3P2P1/PR2PP1P/4K2R w K f6',Again daring more than the wise f6. But I need in chess you don't have to miss the chance to attack or you be fatally attacked in return. 
1033,27,39,2O-O,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3rpp1b/Q1Np4/3P2P1/PR2PP1P/5RK1 b - -',This was Rb2's purpose. Good plan. White is playing very correctly as far as I can see. 
1034,27,40,2e4,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3r1p1b/Q1Npp3/3P2P1/PR2PP1P/5RK1 w - -',Opening lines for my R before white can react with Qb3 - with a discovered check if I move the R. 
1035,27,41,2f3,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3r1p1b/Q1Npp3/3P1PP1/PR2P2P/5RK1 b - -',Nice. The correct move to defend. 
1036,27,42,f4,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3r3b/Q1Np1p2/3P1PP1/PR5P/5RK1 w - -',I hope for g5 Be8 threatening d4 - at last!

1038,27,44,3fxg3,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/3r3b/Q1Np4/3P1Pp1/PR4KP/5R2 w - -',Anyway. 
1039,27,45,Rg5,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/6rb/Q1Np4/3P1PP1/PR4K1/5R2 w - -',Not sure about this or Rd-f5 instead. 
1040,27,46,3f4,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2p5/6rb/Q1Np1P2/3P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',This was the moment I saved the game for. Was this a blunder or wasn't it?
1041,27,47,3Rxf4,b'6k1/p1q3pp/2p5/6rb/Q1Np1r2/3P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 w - -',Apparently I can take on f5 since the g pawn is pinned. 
1042,27,48,3Ne5,b'6k1/p1q3pp/2p5/4N1rb/Q2p1r2/3P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',...and this move just loses a piece. 
1043,27,49,3Qb3+,b'6k1/p5pp/2p5/4q1rb/3p1r2/1Q1P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',If Kh8 I'll set a trap for myself with a weak defence. Note that Bf7 is impossible due to Qb8+ QxQ RxQ+ and black must lose the B to avoid mate. 
1044,27,50,3Qb4+,b'5k2/p5pp/2p5/4q1rb/1Q1p1r2/3P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',White is delaying his death all that he can and I'm not sure he won't succeed. From our amatourish point of view it is a very interesting and tense game still uncertain on move 35. 
1045,27,51,3Qb8+,b'1Q3k2/p5pp/8/2p1q1rb/3p1r2/3P2P1/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',Finally. Now black will lose the Rf5.

1048,27,54,4Kh4,b'8/6pp/4k3/R1p2b2/3p1RPK/3Pr3/P7/8 b - -',Playing rat'n mouse with him all under Rxc4's threat. But it's all fireworks I have no mate (at least as far as I can see). I have no time for h6 - or it will be mate!
1049,27,55,4Bxd3,b'8/6pp/4k3/R1p5/3p1RPK/3br3/P7/8 w - -',Consueling prize. 
1050,27,56,h6,b'8/6p1/4k2p/2R5/3p1RPK/3br3/P7/8 w - -',I I know that Rxd4 will follow but I want a cage around his king because I am setting a mate net. Unfortunately white didn't see it and fall into a one-into-a-million chances I had to save this game. 
1051,27,57,g5+,b'8/8/4k2p/2R3p1/3R2PK/3br3/P7/8 w - g6',White can only play Rxg4 losing a R for two pawns. It would be still better than...
1052,27,58,Rh3#,b'8/8/4k2p/2R3pK/3R2P1/3b3r/P7/8 w - -',...due to the well positioned lsb. White overlooked this not-so-common mate pattern but in general he had me most of the time and proved a strong opponent.

1055,28,2,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So this is the profilactic move. But I am on almost unexplored threads.

1062,28,9,Qc2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2P1BB2/PPq2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',I wonder how can white defend b7 and develop but I was dead wrong. 
1063,28,10,Qxc3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2q1BB2/P2N1PPP/1R2K1NR w Kkq -',+6. A N pinned. Relatively safe Q. b2 is lost but I would welcome to exchange one of white's bishops. It is starting to look hard for me to develop.

Nc3 which is actually part of my opening strategy usually. Well this is also where I begin losing believe it or not. Just take a look at the game analysis I showed at move 1. It's not much but it is the beginning of the end for white but the move made keeps black's f6 knight from advancing to g4. That is what I was thinking at the time.

Both knights and bishops are valuable but in this case my bishop's position may of been better than a trade. Thus I think 8. Ba4 or Bc4 were better moves than Bxc6+.

White has no choice but to take the queen with his king. The problem is when the king moves to f1 goodbye d2 bishop. Taking a measly pawn caused big trouble for white. The only reason I play on is to see how far I can get with my opponent. 
1150,31,33,Rxd2,b'4kb1r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/2b1P3/P3P2P/1P1rNP2/1R3K2 w k -',And the bishop is gone but the trouble is still not over.

1152,31,35,2f4,b'4kb1r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/2b1PP2/P3P2P/1r2N3/4RK2 b k f3',I decide pushing the pawns forward and giving my king a little more space is best.

1154,31,37,2Bb4,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/1bb1PP2/4P2P/1r2NK2/4R3 w k -',The troubles continue. White must save their rook now. Thus the knight is lost for white. 
1155,31,38,Rxe2+,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/1bb1PP2/4P2P/4rK2/6R1 w k -',Black has won it is just a matter of time now. 
1156,31,39,Rxe3+,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/1bb1PP2/4rK1P/8/6R1 w k -',This move confused me. When playing this game I thought he decided to go easy on my and give me his one rook. That was a mistake to believe lol. 
1157,31,40,2Kxe3,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/1bb1PP2/4K2P/8/6R1 b k -',I take and that's when I see the problem. 
1158,31,41,2Bc5+,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/2b5/2b1PP2/4K2P/8/6R1 w k -',The problem is now all I have is a king and 3 pawns. 
1159,31,42,Bxg1,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/8/2b1PP2/5K1P/8/6b1 w k -',Black is really good but I think lasting this long is pretty nice for white. The end is near now though. 
1160,31,43,2f5,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/5P2/2b1P3/5K1P/8/6b1 b k -',Well not much more white can do now.
1161,31,44,2Bf1,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/5P2/4P3/5K1P/8/5bb1 w k -',Well although I have nothing to gain I'll keep my remaining pawns up. 
1162,31,45,2h4,b'4k2r/1p4pp/p4p2/5P2/4P2P/5K2/8/5bb1 b k -',That was another blunder the final one says the computer analysis. The best move was e5? Well I don't agree with that but at this point there really is no good moves. 
1163,31,46,2Kf7,b'7r/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P2/4P2P/5K2/8/5bb1 w - -',Obviously black will get his rook involved now. 
1164,31,47,2h5,b'7r/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P1P/4P3/5K2/8/5bb1 b - -',Nothing else to do really for white. 
1165,31,48,3Kf4,b'3r4/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P1P/4PK2/8/8/5bb1 b - -',With the rook about to attack I decide it is best to try to hide. 
1166,31,49,3Rd3,b'8/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P1P/4PK2/3r4/8/5bb1 w - -',It's over mate in 2. 
1167,31,50,Be2+,b'8/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P1P/4P1K1/3r4/4b3/6b1 w - -',Mate in 1.
1168,31,51,Bh2#,b'8/1p3kpp/p4p2/5P1P/4PK2/3r4/4b2b/8 w - -',Checkmate. Well I look at this and I know I could of done better. Well I am glad to say I have improved my game especially since I came on Gameknot about 1 year ago so I'm proud of how I've improved and I will continue to improve that I know. This game helped teach me things I wasn't aware of so I'm glad to of had this learning experience. Congratulations to Geniusacamel for his win and thank you all for reading commenting and rating this annotation. I hope you all enjoyed it! I'll be annotating game 2 hopefully next week and games 3 and 4 in the weeks to follow. I hope you look forward to them! Until next time :)

1179,32,10,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p1n3p1/1pppp3/4PN2/P1PP2PB/1PQ1NP1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',i decide to grab more of the centre. Nxd5 may have weakened my attack slightly.

1181,32,12,1d4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p1n3p1/1pp1p3/3pP3/P1PP2PB/1PQ1NPNP/R1B2RK1 w - -',i grab more of the centre for myself.

1184,32,15,1h5,b'r1bq1rk1/4npb1/p1n3p1/1pp1p2p/3pP1P1/P1PP3B/1PQBNPNP/R4RK1 w - h6', i try to trick him to take the pawn not expecting he will take it.

1273,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual I aim for an open game.
1274,34,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Not something I see OTB very often as most opponents these days opt for semi-open lines like the French or Sicilian.
1275,34,2,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/1pppbppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
1276,34,3,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/1pppbppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle anyway not seeing any new opportunities or dangers offered by the odd move order.
1277,34,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3.  
1278,34,5,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Recently I've been using the latter even though it does offer Black the chance to force the swap of my LSB by playing ..Na5 before I've provided the B with an escape route.
1279,34,6,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',So now Black plays the more conservative 8...d6.  An immediate 8...Na5 would have given away the pawn on e5.  8...d5 is now less effective with g4 unavailable for Black's LSB or N.
1280,34,7,c3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',and now I have time to create my bolthole for my B.
1281,34,8,1Bc2,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back including putting his knight on the rim where it is dim ... Now the B bolsters e4 and points indirectly at Black's castled position with plenty of potential for effectiveness later in the game.  The Ruy Lopez is typically a slowly developing game with plenty of potential attacks forthcoming once White has established his pieces on good squares.  
1282,34,9,1c5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - c6',Typically Black plays to restrict the power of White's threatened central thrust.  Black usually follows up by recentralising the QN and developing Q and B.
1283,34,10,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - d3',I play the pawn thrust anyway.  I've been experimenting on Gameknot recently with lines involving d3 first in the fashion of Michael Adams but I don't have his skill in strangling opponents and often end up too cramped myself.
1284,34,11,1exd4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3pP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',?!  Surprising and I think not very good as it unleashes my e-pawn.  I'd expected either 11...Nc6 or 11...cxd4.
1285,34,12,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - -',Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.
1286,34,13,1Nbd2,b'r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Even though c3 was now available for this N I preferred to perform the standard Nbd2-f1-g3 manoeuvre as on c3 it would be attacked by ...b4 and either have to retreat to e2 blocking my R's file or advance prematurely to a4 or d5.
1287,34,14,1Bf8,b'r1bqrbk1/5ppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Black continues his plan and I continue with  mine ...
1288,34,15,Qb6,b'r1b1rbk1/5ppp/pq1p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 w - -',!?  This took me by surprise but I couldn't see any advantage to this over the more normal ...Qc7 or continuing with redeploying the DSB.  Later in the game though the Q provided a useful defence of Black's third row from here.
1289,34,16,1e5,b'r1b1rbk1/5p1p/pq1p1np1/npp1P3/3P4/5NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I decided to make this thrust before I'd completed my development as Black's QN and DSB were still out of position.
1290,34,17,1dxe5,b'r1b1rbk1/5p1p/pq3np1/npp1P3/8/5NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Recapturing with the N wouldn't have been much use as Black would have taken the pawn on d4 with impunity.
1291,34,18,1Rd8,b'r1br1bk1/5p1p/pq3np1/npp1P3/8/5NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I'd expect Black to retreat the N to d7 immediately.  This forces me to decide between blocking the attack with a piece or moving my Q to e2.  I'd rather not self-pin if I can avoid it so ...
1292,34,19,Nd5,b'r1br1bk1/5p1p/pq4p1/nppnP3/8/5NNP/PPB1QPP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I'd expected ...Nd7 but this more active continuation covers two of the best squares for my DSB
1293,34,20,1Bg5,b'r1br1bk1/5p1p/pq4p1/nppnP1B1/8/5NNP/PPB1QPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I take advantage of Black's 17th by attacking the Rd8 while developing my last minor piece.

1295,34,22,2Rad1,b'r1br2k1/4bp1p/pq4p1/nppnP1B1/8/5NNP/PPB1QPP1/3RR1K1 b - -',In the interest of completing my development I was happy to allow Black to swap on g5 whereupon my N would take up an attacking position and give the f3 square to my Q thus forcing Black to defend f7.  I felt that my position was building up nicely into a good platform for a devastating kingside assault.
1296,34,23,Be6,b'r2r2k1/5p1p/pq2b1p1/nppnP1N1/8/6NP/PPB1QPP1/3RR1K1 w - -',A good developing move defending f7 into the bargain.
1297,34,24,2Ng3e4,b'r2r2k1/5p1p/pq2b1p1/nppnP1N1/4N3/7P/PPB1QPP1/3RR1K1 b - -',I planned to play Nf6+ and if Black captured with the Nd5 exf6 providing potential for later delivering mate on g7 or at least using the threat to win material.
1298,34,25,2Nc4,b'r2r2k1/5p1p/pq2b1p1/1ppnP1N1/2n1N3/7P/PPB1QPP1/3RR1K1 w - -',! Black activates the QN forking the pawns on b2 and e5.  Now came my longest think of the game as I calculated several different lines and move orders.  Eventually I decided to sac the e5 pawn with a view to prosecuting my attack and winning back material later if I couldn't deliver mate.
1299,34,26,Nd7,b'r2r2k1/3n1p1p/pq2b1p1/1pp1Q1N1/8/1P5P/P1B2PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',For some reason I had overlooked this so I had to don the thinking cap again.
1300,34,27,2Qe2,b'r2r2k1/3n1p1p/pq2b1p1/1pp3N1/8/1P5P/P1B1QPP1/3RR1K1 b - -',I don't remember what the reasoning was that led to this move.  Looking at it afresh I think 24. Qf4 might have been better
1301,34,28,Bf5,b'r2r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp2b2/4N3/1P5P/P1B1QPP1/3RR1K1 w - -',This seems a good move skewering Ne5 and Bc2 while defending f6 with the Q.
1302,34,29,2Qf3,b'r2r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp2b2/4N3/1P3Q1P/P1B2PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',A good square ... eying the Ra8 should Black disconnect his rooks and building the pressure on f6 and f7.
1303,34,30,2Qg3,b'2rr1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp2b2/4N3/1P4QP/P1B2PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',Now I was looking at putting R or N on d6 and penetrating on the dark squares with my Q.  Both this move and the previous one would have been unnecessary if I'd played 26. Qf4 though Black would soon have threatened to shift my Q with 26. ...Nf8 and 27. ...Ne6.
1304,34,31,3Bxd1,b'2r2nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp2b2/4N3/1P4QP/P4PP1/3BR1K1 b - -',Relieving the skewer and maintaining the R on the e-file.
1305,34,32,3Rd8,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp2b2/4N3/1P4QP/P4PP1/3BR1K1 w - -',This move overloads my R.

1307,34,34,3Bxg4,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp5/4N1b1/1P4QP/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',So Black swapped the Bs.
1308,34,35,3hxg4,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1pp5/4N1P1/1P4Q1/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',32. Qxg4 would have been met by 32. ...f5! forking N and Q.
1309,34,36,3c4,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/1p6/2p1N1P1/1P4Q1/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Black opens the diagonal to my f-pawn and Kg1 while threatening to march this pawn to promotion
1310,34,37,bxc4,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/8/2p1N1P1/6Q1/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',At least this advanced pawn is now isolated but I have to keep it under surveillance.
1311,34,38,3g5,b'3r1nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/6P1/2p1N3/6Q1/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Taking control of f6 and h6 with my doubled pawn.  With Black's N on f8 I couldn't see a way of forcing mate yet but felt that I would be able to win back my pawn by attacking directly.
1312,34,39,3Rd3,b'5nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/6P1/2p1N3/3r2Q1/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Counter-attack! ... but this merely forces me to move my Q and I find a good square for her.
1313,34,40,3Qe5,b'5nk1/5p1p/pq4p1/4Q1P1/2p1N3/3r4/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',hoping to be able to play Nf6+ followed by Nd7 discovered check and picking up Black's Q.
1314,34,41,3Nf6+,b'6k1/3n1p1p/pq3Np1/4Q1P1/2p5/3r4/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',That dream had been foiled but other attacking options sprang to mind.
1315,34,42,3gxf6,b'6k1/5p1p/pq3Pp1/4Q3/2p5/3r4/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',At last I have a pawn established on f6 and threaten mate in one.
1316,34,43,3Qxf7+,b'8/5Q1k/pq3Pp1/7p/2p5/3r4/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - -',I've won the pawn back at last and have a potentially mating attack backed up by an advanced passed pawn.
1317,34,44,Kh4,b'8/6Q1/pq3Pp1/4R2p/2p4k/3r4/P4PP1/6K1 w - -',unexpectedly avoiding the opportunity to attack my R with ...Kf4.  Now I sank deep into thought again worrying that I had to continue delivering check until I could mate him in the mistaken belief that failing to do so might allow him to deliver mate himself.
1318,34,45,4Qe7,b'8/4Q3/pq3Pp1/4R2p/2p4k/3r4/P4PP1/6K1 b - -',?? played in a suddenly defensive frame of mind brought on by the feeling that I'd kept missing things and I couldn't afford to allow myself to be mated.  I should simply have captured g6 and if Black checked on my back row played Kh2 where the K would have been safe long enough to allow me to deliver mate on g5 or h5
1319,34,46,4f3+,b'8/8/p4qp1/7p/2p4k/5P2/P5P1/4Q1K1 b - -',looks clever but doesn't win the pawn back.  Simply 45. Qe4+ would have rounded up the c-pawn and then defended a2 and attacked a6
1320,34,47,Qd4+,b'8/8/p5p1/6kp/2pq4/Q4P2/P5P1/6K1 w - -',and short of time Black offered the draw which I gladly accepted knowing that I'd blown a winning position but not at that time knowing exactly how or when.  I was a nervous wreck for several minutes after this but reassured as my colleagues' results came in.  We were 3-2 up with just the top board in progress and looking good for a draw when I left.
1321,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A very conventional opening.
1322,35,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The well known Caro Kann.  As you know after having to get play against it and getting used to opponents playing so I played this once and finally adjusted to it fully in my game against Jack as not only a win but a first time where I did not make a single mistake or inaccuracy and it was against this defense.
1323,35,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Of course.  The most common response and again a good way to remember is that when black only advances one square after 1.e4 then 2.d4 is generally the best response anyway.
1324,35,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Despite it being the Caro Kann as opposed to French the same idea still applies.  Yes this is still the best response and will lead to some interesting variations.
1325,35,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Instead I would've played the immediate 3.exd5 with the exchange.  But I think this is a better because it's still an exchange when he takes and this develops a piece.  So right now white is already slightly ahead given that in addition to the central pawns he has a piece out.
1326,35,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Good move getting a piece.  Ok but I would've responded with 4...Nd7  The idea is to develop N's before B's since we know where the N ought to go.
1327,35,6,Ng3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Yes this is also what I would've played and not just for an attack.  If that were so I wouldn't play it.  The idea is that after white protects with this move he can get another piece out whereas black's B needs protection.  So already I'd say that white has a very small advantage because he is slightly ahead in development.
1328,35,7,Bg6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Ok it protects the B.
1329,35,8,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',! As noted develops another piece and prepares white to castle K side which is going to happen very soon and as quickly as I predict.
1330,35,9,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A center pawn is what it develops so it is a good move.  But not the best in my mind because white's going to finish the K side at once whereas black still needs to deploy more pieces.
1331,35,10,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Yes the move I would've played.
1332,35,11,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?! Ok at least it develops.  However this is an inaccuracy.  Best was 7...Ne7 and if white takes the LSB black responds with the N.  Instead now if white does this the only recapture is with a p.  So this time white would have a bigger advantage counting structurally as nothing's lost.  As now not only away from the center but right near the K there would be doubled pawns making it unsafe to castle K side as there would be a potential weakness around it.  
1333,35,12,O-O,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I like this move a lot.  The K is safe and all but I would have held off another move and played 8.Bxg6!! for the reason that I outlined a move ago.
1334,35,13,Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',To develop another piece but it is not the best move however as the N's look rather uncomfortable.  Instead better was 8...Nc7 in my opinion.  However I would have brought the DSB into play immediately so that castling would be feasible right after.
1335,35,14,Bxg6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pnB1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',!! And now what I mentioned about doubled pawns away from the center and the K having difficulties should black castle K side has become a reality.  And with it white already has a very noticeable advantage.  Not lost for black yet but with best play from white geniusacamel is going to win this quite easily.
1336,35,15,hxg6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pnp1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',It's better then 9...hxg6 which would put that K in an uncomfortable position.
1337,35,16,1Bf4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pnp1/8/3P1B2/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Develops the last piece.  But what I would've played is 10.Bg5 pinning the N to Q which is what I typically do.  There are occasions however where it isn't good because black would then sac a piece to get a winning advantage as I learned.  However this is not one of those occasions in my opinion.
1338,35,17,1Qb6,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1pp1/1qp1pnp1/8/3P1B2/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?! Understand why black played this.  But it is not the right approach which is why I'm giving it an inaccuracy.  What he assumes is that he is going to win a pawn unless white defends.  The problem is as you see with white's best move there is a way to defend it.  11.b3 is also optional but what white plays next is the best as I learned from experience and with Jack as it avoids pressure where later black still threatens to win the P so white would then lose tempo.  But 11.Rb1 is going to prevent that.
1339,35,18,c5,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1pp1/1q2pnp1/2p5/3P1B2/5NN1/PPP2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',The idea is to exchange.  Ok fair enough.  I either would've developed the remaining piece or castled.  And in my books castling Q side is safer this time since black has doubled pawns on the other side.  I feel that castling K side make his K susceptible to a weakness which is something to be weary.  So having said that I would've played 11...0-0-0 here
1340,35,19,Bxc5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/1q2pnp1/2b5/5B2/5NN1/PPP2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',At least his last piece is up and about.
1341,35,20,1c4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/1q2pnp1/2b5/2P2B2/5NN1/PP3PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq c3',The intention is to get the last piece out and connect the R's.  He also intends to pin the d N but black is not going to allow it.
1342,35,21,1Qa6,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/q3pnp1/2b5/2P2B2/5NN1/PP3PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',Instead of preventing the pin this way I would've castled here.  And things have drastically as I don't like the position anymore if black were to castle Q side as even without the pin Qa4 afterward is a bit risky for black.  So I would've castled short in this position.
1343,35,22,1Qc2,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/q3pnp1/2b5/2P2B2/5NN1/PPQ2PPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',Since 14.Qa4?? is no longer a feasibility without losing the Q white might as well get that Q out by moving it.  
1344,35,23,1Be7,b'r3k2r/pp1nbpp1/q3pnp1/8/2P2B2/5NN1/PPQ2PPP/1R3RK1 w kq -',This is not an exception to the guideline about K safety since nothing is at risk here.  So I don't know why black hasn't castled yet.
1345,35,24,1b4,b'r3k2r/pp1nbpp1/q3pnp1/8/1PP2B2/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 b kq b3',Unlike before I also do not know why white played this either.  Better however was 15.b3! as white has a stronger pawn structure since those three pawns would be connected.  As I remember: sometimes it's brilliant while in other cases it's a blunder.  In this position it would've been extraordinarly brilliant since from my experience the b and c pawns often get nasty especially the b pawn.
1346,35,25,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1nbpp1/q3pnp1/8/1PP2B2/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',At last black castles.
1347,35,26,1c5,b'r4rk1/pp1nbpp1/q3pnp1/2P5/1P3B2/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',! Yes this move is the best way to protect the c pawn.  Another option was also 16.Be3 but I like this move better but unlike before it is specifically because of the fact that it strengthens white's pawn structure.
1348,35,27,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/pp1nbpp1/q3p1p1/2Pn4/1P3B2/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',He's still trying to grab.
1349,35,28,1Bg5,b'r4rk1/pp1nbpp1/q3p1p1/2Pn2B1/1P6/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Ok white protects with this move.  But I would've played 17.b5 and after 17...Qa3 I would play 18.Rb3  After analyzing the position I realize that white would've won the Q with 17.b5 because it's trapped with what I noted where no matter where it goes white would've been able to capture.
1350,35,29,1Nd7f6,b'r4rk1/pp2bpp1/q3pnp1/2Pn2B1/1P6/5NN1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',To protect the B.
1351,35,30,1Ne5,b'r4rk1/pp2bpp1/q3pnp1/2PnN1B1/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',But the immediate 18.b5!! was still possible.
1352,35,31,1Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/pp2bpp1/q3pnp1/2PnN1B1/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',! Now that opportunity is gone with this move.
1353,35,32,1Rfe1,b'r1r3k1/pp2bpp1/q3pnp1/2PnN1B1/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',The idea is to put pressure right in the center and with it and for the same reason this is the move I would've played.
1354,35,33,1Qb5,b'r1r3k1/pp2bpp1/4pnp1/1qPnN1B1/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',To win the b pawn.
1355,35,34,2Bxf6,b'r1r3k1/pp2bpp1/4pBp1/1qPnN3/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',I would've played a4 right here and not a move later.  I recently learned from Jack this past week that when a pin is undone meaning that the opponent breaks the pin with the B most common and best way it generally is not a good idea to then take that N.
1356,35,35,2Bxf6,b'r1r3k1/pp3pp1/4pbp1/1qPnN3/1P6/6N1/P1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',This is the reason as now that black retook like this the person who played it will often have run into difficulties because the opponent puts pressure right on the center.  It often starts when the player takes back with BXN as is the case here.
1357,35,36,2a4,b'r1r3k1/pp3pp1/4pbp1/1qPnN3/PP6/6N1/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - a3',! With this move white has a passed pawn.  Whether it can promote or not remains to be seen.
1358,35,37,2Qb6,b'r1r3k1/pp3pp1/1q2pbp1/2PnN3/PP6/6N1/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',?? Better was 21...Qa6 or 21...Qe8 because this move should cost black his Q.
1359,35,38,2Nd3,b'r1r3k1/pp3pp1/1q2pbp1/2Pn4/PP6/3N2N1/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',As said on the last move best was 22.cxb6! and that's what I would've played if I were white.
1360,35,39,2Qc7,b'r1r3k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2Pn4/PP6/3N2N1/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',! With this move white no longer has that opportunity to win black's Q.
1361,35,40,2Ne4,b'r1r3k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2Pn4/PP2N3/3N4/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',I don't know why white played this.
1362,35,41,2Rcd8,b'r2r2k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2Pn4/PP2N3/3N4/2Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',! The idea is to attack the center and as I learned from WB this will help strengthen your position and sometimes to control the center as well.  Well not the case here but it does strengthen that center control.
1363,35,42,2g3,b'r2r2k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2Pn4/PP2N3/3N2P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',?! An inaccuracy in my opinion.  Black was not threatening mate and this isn't an endgame.  So the K isn't a weapon.  Therefore I don't know why white had to open up like this.
1364,35,43,2Ne7,b'r2r2k1/ppq1npp1/4pbp1/2P5/PP2N3/3N2P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 w - -',I also don't understand the logic behind this move.  Instead I would've played 24...Qd7 putting pressure right in the center.
1365,35,44,2Qc4,b'r2r2k1/ppq1npp1/4pbp1/2P5/PPQ1N3/3N2P1/5P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',! Yes and this is what I would've played as well as now there is a lot of pressure on the c file and a little for black to worry about here.
1366,35,45,2Nf5,b'r2r2k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2P2n2/PPQ1N3/3N2P1/5P1P/1R2R1K1 w - -',Don't understand this move too well.  But better was 25...Rd4 which is in fact what I would've played to.  Why while not that effective there is technically a fork then on the Q and N and when white gets out of it with Qc2 the position is a little crammed since the Q and Ns appeared lopped up against one another.  What I recently learned is that having a crammed position like that gives the opponent a slight advantage.
1367,35,46,2Nf4,b'r2r2k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2P2n2/PPQ1NN2/6P1/5P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',I like this response for the reason I outlined earlier regarding the crammed position.
1368,35,47,2Rd4,b'r5k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2P2n2/PPQrNN2/6P1/5P1P/1R2R1K1 w - -',! Yes and now black plays what I noted a move ago.
1369,35,48,2Qc2,b'r5k1/ppq2pp1/4pbp1/2P2n2/PP1rNN2/6P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',! A very good way to get out of the situation.  And absorb that with this move given that white's N is not on d3 the position isn't crammed.  With that it's starting to get very interesting and complicated.
1370,35,49,2a5,b'r5k1/1pq2pp1/4pbp1/p1P2n2/PP1rNN2/6P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 w - a6',The idea behind is to exchange.  And yes I like this move a lot and in fact what I would've done as well.  I like the exchange variation.
1371,35,50,2b5,b'r5k1/1pq2pp1/4pbp1/pPP2n2/P2rNN2/6P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',! Surprisingly white doesn't allow it.  I used to view as an inaccuracy.  That was until I studied about pawn structures from WB and what I learned is that away from the center when the opponent goes after a pawn like that instead of taking better is usually just to advance it forward as white just did.  In this case yes that is the idea.
1372,35,51,2Be7,b'r5k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPP2n2/P2rNN2/6P1/2Q2P1P/1R2R1K1 w - -',Of course putting pressure on it.
1373,35,52,2Ne2,b'r5k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPP2n2/P2rN3/6P1/2Q1NP1P/1R2R1K1 b - -',My next move would've been 29.b6 to strengthen that pawn structure.  But I like this move even better though simply because if you advance that pawn on the 6th rank black cans still stop the passed pawn with 29...Qc6  With this move however that is no longer feasible.
1374,35,53,2Rd5,b'r5k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPPr1n2/P3N3/6P1/2Q1NP1P/1R2R1K1 w - -',Ok very conventional adding pressure right to the c pawn.
1375,35,54,3Rec1,b'r5k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPPr1n2/P3N3/6P1/2Q1NP1P/1RR3K1 b - -',! The response however is very good.  This is the kind of thing that occurred in a game between GM's Judit Polgar and Anand.  Now Anand put a lot of pressure on a pawn like that and to protect JP put the Q right in front of the R similar to the position we have here.
1376,35,55,3Rad8,b'3r2k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPPr1n2/P3N3/6P1/2Q1NP1P/1RR3K1 w - -',Ok.  What's good is that black is doubling up which as we know doubled rooks are dangerous.  However in this position I would've played 30...Rac8 for the same reason I outlined with the mounted pressure on the c pawn.
1377,35,56,3Rb3,b'3r2k1/1pq1bpp1/4p1p1/pPPr1n2/P3N3/1R4P1/2Q1NP1P/2R3K1 b - -',Since white is not going to double up with 32.Rc3 I don't know why this was played.  That's what I would've done.  So now I would've played 31.b6 preparing for 31...Bxc6 so that the N could jump right in action with 32.Nxc6
1378,35,57,3g5,b'3r2k1/1pq1bpp1/4p3/pPPr1np1/P3N3/1R4P1/2Q1NP1P/2R3K1 w - -',!? When you have doubled pawns away from the center as is the case here the idea is to advance one of them so that they could be traded.  This is what Jack typically does when his pawns become doubled and I learned that exact lesson from him.  However this is an inaccuracy according to the analysis.  According to them black's best move was 31...Nd4  Then comes 32.Nxd4 Rxd4 33.c6 Rxa4 34.b6 Qxc6 35.Qxc6 bxc6 36.b7 Rxe4 37.b8=Q Rxb8 38.Rxb8+ Bf8 39.Rxc6 a4
1379,35,58,3h3,b'3r2k1/1pq1bpp1/4p3/pPPr1np1/P3N3/1R4PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 b - -',!? Idea is to exchange but this is risky in my opinion because since it's not an endgame the K is now at risk of exposure because there are pawns that have advanced right near it so the monarch has less protection now.
1380,35,59,3f6,b'3r2k1/1pq1b1p1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/1R4PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 w - -',?! Possibly to get connected pawns.  Is so the plan is a little risky for more or less the same reason.  As I learned sometimes pawn structures are brilliant whereas in other cases there blunders.  I wouldn't call it either or but closer to a blunder as it's a little bit risky.
1381,35,60,3Kh2,b'3r2k1/1pq1b1p1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/1R4PP/2Q1NP1K/2R5 b - -',With what I noted I don't understand this at all.
1382,35,61,3Kf7,b'3r4/1pq1bkp1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/1R4PP/2Q1NP1K/2R5 w - -',Also don't know why black played this either.
1383,35,62,3Rc3,b'3r4/1pq1bkp1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/2R3PP/2Q1NP1K/2R5 b - -',! At last white plays the move that I noted earlier.  And with it and given that they're one space apart white has a noticeable advantage.  However I would've quick played this immediately.  That is on the 31st move.
1384,35,63,3Kg8,b'3r2k1/1pq1b1p1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/2R3PP/2Q1NP1K/2R5 w - -',What this move proves is what I mentioned that black wasted time with his last move.
1385,35,64,3Kg1,b'3r2k1/1pq1b1p1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/2R3PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 b - -',Now making use of the opposition.  Although that would apply in the endgame but still I guess that it would be good to do something like that.  The real question is why move the K so early?  
1386,35,65,3Kf7,b'3r4/1pq1bkp1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P3N3/2R3PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 w - -',Not an inaccuracy but because of what I asked I'll call this move a waste of time.
1387,35,66,3Rc4,b'3r4/1pq1bkp1/4pp2/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 b - -',! On the one hand I like where that R was.  On the other hand I really like this move.  The reason is because it allows white to still go for b6 but with better results this time then what I noted earlier.  After he does and suppose that black responds with ...Qb8 white now has a dangerous passed pawn.  Could play c6 with the idea that black just takes it and then white can advance that b pawn even further.
1388,35,67,3g6,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/2Q1NP2/2R3K1 w - -',! What I noted earlier regarding doubled pawns is exactly why I also would've played this.
1389,35,68,3Qb2,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/1Q2NP2/2R3K1 b - -',! Adding pressure on the b file.  While I also liked it when the Q was on the c file this just adds one more defender to the b pawn should white ever decide to advance it.
1390,35,69,3Rd5d3,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPP2np1/P1R1N3/3r2PP/1Q2NP2/2R3K1 w - -',Don't understand what this move accomplishes.
1391,35,70,3Qb1,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPP2np1/P1R1N3/3r2PP/4NP2/1QR3K1 b - -',But a good way to exploit the weakness that black created.  Now this gains valuable time for white.
1392,35,71,3Rd3d5,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NP2/1QR3K1 w - -',! The only way to protect the R. 38...R3d7 looks good to but isn't because of 39.c6 bxc6 40.bxc6 in which black still loses the R.
1393,35,72,3Kg2,b'3r4/1pq1bk2/4ppp1/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1QR5 b - -',Still don't know why white keeps advancing his K.
1394,35,73,3Kg7,b'3r4/1pq1b1k1/4ppp1/pPPr1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1QR5 w - -',Well now black has opposition which is something that I will keep emphasizing in this annotation since it is a very important concept.
1395,35,74,4c6,b'3r4/1pq1b1k1/2P1ppp1/pP1r1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1QR5 b - -',! Trying to win an exchange.
1396,35,75,4b6,b'3r4/2q1b1k1/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1QR5 w - -',With him strengthening his pawn structures black won't allow this.
1397,35,76,4Rh1,b'3r4/2q1b1k1/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1Q5R b - -',! Adding protection to the h file.
1398,35,77,4Kf7,b'3r4/2q1bk2/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1np1/P1R1N3/6PP/4NPK1/1Q5R w - -',Don't understand why he played this.
1399,35,78,4h4,b'3r4/2q1bk2/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1np1/P1R1N2P/6P1/4NPK1/1Q5R b - -',!? Don't know why he played this because there's not going to be an immediate exchange yet.  And if there was meaning that he'd take back with 43.gxh4 I would give this move an !  But since not I call it dubious because I don't know what it accomplishes.
1400,35,79,4gxh4,b'3r4/2q1bk2/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1n2/P1R1N2p/6P1/4NPK1/1Q5R w - -',As anticipated.
1401,35,80,4Ne4c3,b'3r4/2q1bk2/1pP1ppp1/pP1r1n2/P1R4p/2N3P1/4NPK1/1Q5R b - -',?  I understand the idea behind it I think anyway.  The idea is pressure on the center.  But according to the analysis it is a mistake.  I agree with that.  I would've played the immediate 43.gxh4 but what the computer says is even better as not only just exchanging but winding up a pawn ahead.  What they suggest is 43.g4 with the idea of 43...Ng7  And now 44.N4c3 f5 45.Nxd5 exd5 46.Rf4 Bg5 47.Rf3 Kg8 48.Rfh3 Re8 49.Qd3 fxg4 50.Qxd5+ Kh7

And since it is the last mistake mentioned in the analysis I'm going to say that this is this losing blunder.  Instead best was 43...Rd3  Then 44.gxh4 Bb4 45.h4 g5 46.Rd1 Rxd1 47.Nxd1 Bc5 48.Ng3 Rd2 49.Ne4 Nh4+ 50.Kh1
1403,35,82,4g4,b'3r4/2q1bk2/1pP1ppp1/pP2rn2/P1R3Pp/2N5/4NPK1/1Q5R b - -',Ok mounting pressure still but I just would've taken with 44.gxh4 given that he would not retake with 44...Nxh4?? because of the h R.
1404,35,83,4Ng7,b'3r4/2q1bkn1/1pP1ppp1/pP2r3/P1R3Pp/2N5/4NPK1/1Q5R w - -',? Understandable but I would've gone on the offense and retreated with 44...Nd6  The idea is as I read in charleshiggie annotation and then did with Jack with astonishing results isn't attack per say but when you retreat and get out of danger you do so with a counterpunch by reattacking.  It makes it so that the opponents plan does not work.  That's the idea behind it.  And it most certainly would've protected the h pawn for now.  And with it this move is a mistake because white regains the pawn immediately with his next move.
1405,35,84,Rc5,b'3r4/2q1bkn1/1pP1ppp1/pPr5/P1R3PR/2N5/4NPK1/1Q6 w - -',The idea is exchange which will happen.
1406,35,85,4Rh7,b'3r4/2q1bknR/2P1ppp1/pPp5/P5P1/2N5/4NPK1/1Q6 b - -',! Yes this is exactly what I would've played to pinning that N directly.  Note: I did this in quite a few games including my game against Jack a couple of weeks ago.  No absolutely guarantees but more often not I've won several games by directly pinning the N like this.
1407,35,86,4f5,b'3r4/2q1bknR/2P1p1p1/pPp2p2/P5P1/2N5/4NPK1/1Q6 w - -',Ok but not the best move.  The idea is force the exchange which in general I do and how back in the day I would've done..  But I would've played 47...Kg1 to undue the pin whilst going right after that R.  Not the very last one but the game prior this is exactly what Jack did when he was pawn ahead and doing so increased his advantage more and more until it became overwhelming for me.
1408,35,87,4Qh1,b'3r4/2q1bknR/2P1p3/pPp2p2/P7/2N5/4NPK1/7Q b - -',! While it might not appear so at last I understand something that I wouldn't have several moves ago.  The idea behind this isn't easy but to put more pressure on that N and force black to do something to avoid a checkmate with Qxg7#  It's a good plan here because by making things difficult on black white should have an overwhelming advantage from here on in.
1409,35,88,4Rg8,b'6r1/2q1bknR/2P1p3/pPp2p2/P7/2N5/4NPK1/7Q w - -',Of course it's not so easy as we know.  But what it shows is that black is thinking ahead as well which is very important.
1410,35,89,5Qh5+,b'6r1/2q1bknR/2P1p3/pPp2p1Q/P7/2N5/4NPK1/8 b - -',"So white comes up with another plan given that the N is pinned.  And the way to remember is ""There is always another of doing things"" as chesskingdom64 puts it."
1411,35,90,5Kf8,b'5kr1/2q1b1nR/2P1p3/pPp2p1Q/P7/2N5/4NPK1/8 w - -',! Correct.  The only other choice was 50...Kf6 but then white mates after 51.Rh6+ Ke5 (forced) 52.f4#  So this is the best move.  Having said that this is also what I would've played as well and for the exact same reason.
1412,35,91,5Qh6,b'5kr1/2q1b1nR/2P1p2Q/pPp2p2/P7/2N5/4NPK1/8 b - -',So white now devices another plan to force the win.
1413,35,92,5Bd6,b'5kr1/2q3nR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P7/2N5/4NPK1/8 w - -',In my opinion this move was not necessary.  Maybe he was worried that white would mate instantly but that R prevents white from playing 52.Qxg7# as without it this would be mate.  Instead I would have advanced the pawn right away with 51...e5 with the idea of connecting them with 52...e4 this would be my plan as black.
1414,35,93,5Nb1,b'5kr1/2q3nR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P7/8/4NPK1/1N6 b - -',This time I have no idea why white played this.  My next move would've been to attempt an exchange with the idea of putting the monarch in an uncomfortable so I would've played 52.Rh8 in this position.
1415,35,94,5Kf7,b'6r1/2q2knR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P7/8/4NPK1/1N6 w - -',Of course black sees that possibility and therefore plays this which is exactly how I would've responded in this situation.
1416,35,95,5Nd2,b'6r1/2q2knR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P7/8/3NNPK1/8 b - -',Like before I don't know what this move accomplishes.  Instead I would've immediately played 53.Qh5+ kind of similar to what happened before as the N is now pinned again.
1417,35,96,5Qd8,b'3q2r1/5knR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P7/8/3NNPK1/8 w - -',To reduce the trouble that black is in given that now white can't get an even exchange with Rh8.  However it is too little too late for black as the damage has been done and white has more then one way to win as we're about to see. 
1418,35,97,5Nc4,b'3q2r1/5knR/2Pbp2Q/pPp2p2/P1N5/8/4NPK1/8 b - -',Now I understand why he played Nd2  Had to be the plan all along.  He's achieving a strong N pair to exploit black's weaknesses.  As it turns out he was repositioning his N's for a long while.
1419,35,98,5Bb8,b'1b1q2r1/5knR/2P1p2Q/pPp2p2/P1N5/8/4NPK1/8 w - -',"However I don't know what this move accomplishes.  But no matter what white has the winning advantage.  As Ted says ""The end is near."""
1420,35,99,5Nf4,b'1b1q2r1/5knR/2P1p2Q/pPp2p2/P1N2N2/8/5PK1/8 b - -',Also why Ne2 makes sense as well since white was repositioning that other knight in addition.  
1421,35,100,5Qf6,b'1b4r1/5knR/2P1pq1Q/pPp2p2/P1N2N2/8/5PK1/8 w - -',But this move will help a little.  Bringing the Q for protection which is exactly what Jack did a couple of times and what Tom did once to drive off a mate threat which was very difficult to do so.  Of course I miscalculated one thing because it appeared that they would lose something but putting the Q out like that prevented that.  But not this time because white forces the exchange here.  And afterwards white will have a threat that can no longer be driven off.
1422,35,101,Kxf6,b'1b4r1/6nR/2P1pk2/pPp2p2/P1N2N2/8/5PK1/8 w - -',And now what is black to do?
1423,35,102,5Kf3,b'1b4r1/6nR/2P1pk2/pPp2p2/P1N2N2/5K2/5P2/8 b - -',! Instead I would've played the immediate 57.Rh6+ followed by bringing one of those N's on the 6th rank making it very dangerous for black.  However the move played is just as good and effective as white has the opposition but even better now then it were before because black cannot get out of trouble.
1424,35,103,5e5,b'1b4r1/6nR/2P2k2/pPp1pp2/P1N2N2/5K2/5P2/8 w - -',Now we can say that black no longer has a defense so he might as well do anything.  I will generally think defensively here but there is nothing that black can do.
1425,35,104,5Rh6+,b'1b4r1/6n1/2P2k1R/pPp1pp2/P1N2N2/5K2/5P2/8 b - -',And with it black resigned here.  For a while I couldn't figure this out as I would've played on.  Yes he could get out of check but mate is soon to follow with those Knights.  Plus white will just keep ganging up so with no way out of it black waved the flag.

But I remember ION telling me that he doesn't play the French Defense that often and would like to try something different.  Since I'm not very familiar with it and there's a lot to learn given that now I've become good at playing the Caro Kann and other defenses but not the French and after having some bad luck including my game against geniusacamel and blitzkov but during the misstep which just wasn't a good game at all I realize that there is a lot to learn.  Remember: learning more things means that there's just so much you don't know.  So as part of the theory I wanted to get better at playing against this defense.  Therefore I told archduke that it isn't a problem and I like the defense as there's more for me to learn.  So it was game on.
1485,39,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Of course I finally remembered the best response.  As it's said when the opponent responds to 1.e4 by advancing one pawn best is 2.d4  I like going by this model to since it's a central and henceforth a developing move to open lines for the B and that you need those central files to control the center.
1486,39,3,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Deciding to fianchetto.  Interesting.  But in my mind not the best.  From what myevilluck told me in the WTWLTR when he was a mentor and then what this opponent previously taught me in other annotations fianchettoing generally isn't the best idea because it'll often waste a tempo when you could have developed the B right then and there since that e pawn has advanced.  So the idea would be to bring it out right then and there.  Of course the more moves black makes the more I'm learning because there's more things to get used to and then adjust so that you remember that there can be a lot of possibilities and sometimes variations to an opening or defense.  What I learned then is that there are also several variations to the French.
1487,39,4,O-O,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1pp3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Of course the idea is castle early and often.  Now usually what's important is that you know how there are exceptions to that guideline.  From what I've noticed this happens a lot with strong players.  A good example was against jstevens1 where I castled right into the attack and then wound up in trouble.  So this is where you really have to evaluate which is good as it's part of doing that HW.  But here in this position I saw that castling would not cause any immediate problems so I just went for it since K safety is essential.
1488,39,5,Be3,b'r2qkbnr/pbpn1p1p/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Not only completing development but another idea with this move is a strong B pair.  The idea is that since they're both in the center with N's it's well coordinated so the center is well controlled.  The idea from what I learned is that for the center to be controlled not only do you need the pieces out but everything has to coordinated in the center.  Like hear the line up is with the B's and both N's placed right next to each B.  That was my plan right after castling.  What I just didn't realize is how quick I could do it because usually there are exceptions shortly after castling that a pawn or piece is threatened and then you must protect it but not in this position.

In it he said this but towards the end.  However it applies here.  What he said was ..."" my 11th move was a straight-out blunder. The odd thing about it was that my immediate thought on seeing 11.Rc1 was ""well 11...c5 is unplayable."" So why I played it (after thinking about what else to play) I can not explain to myself...""  This is also where he complimented and said that I'm doing extremely well so far and have not made any mistakes yet.  And ironically they outline that this would've been best six moves earlier.  The reason is because of what I do next.  My plan now that I've completed development is to make a threat that will be difficult to drive off so no cheapo tactics.  The real plan was to win a pawn.  So best is according to what it shows is 11...g5  Then the proper continuation would be 12.Qe2 0-0 13.h3 Ra8 14.a4 Nc6 15.b5 Nb4 16.Bc4 Nf6 17.Rab1 a5 18.d5 Qe7 19.dxe6 fxe6"

The reason behind this move is that he's going to lose a pawn one way or another.  That was actually why I played this.  So the idea was take on d6 or on a7.
1491,39,8,1cxd4,b'2rqk2r/pb1nnpb1/1p1pp1pp/1N6/1P1pP3/P2BBN2/2PQ1PPP/R2R2K1 w k -',? This is a mistake because of what I play next.   Now what I thought he'd play was 12...Rc6 which was the anticipated move and computer outlines as the best.  But then I'd take with 13.Nxa7  And the proper follow up would be 13...Rc7 14.Nb5 Rc6 15.c4 Qb8 16.e5 cxd4 17.Nfxd4 Bxe5 18.Nxc6 Bxc6 19.Nc3  But with this move black's in trouble after what I play.  The real idea was to take away black's opportunity to castle which is what I achieve here.  And as ION pointed the mistake did not happen here.  
1492,39,9,1Bxd4,b'2rq1k1r/pb1nnpb1/1p1Np1pp/8/1P1BP3/P2B1N2/2PQ1PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',! I thought this was the blunder worthy of ?? only because of what I thought ION outlined. Actually what he said is that this move is on the money.   However I was not going to take right away on c8  because by protecting my B the idea is to take on g7 with the same piece which will happen.  My intention was to expose black's K so by doing that I feel that black has a weakness which I'm exploiting since K safety is extremely important.  Where had I taken now I'd be stuck with a weakness right after.  And black would have the advantage immediately.   
1493,39,10,1Nb5,b'2r4r/pbqnnpk1/1p2p1pp/1N6/1P2P3/P2B1N2/2PQ1PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',"?? According to the analysis which I agree this is a mistake but not for the same reason.  The computer outlines 16.Be2 as the best move but that's wrong.  And as ION put it this is the losing blunder.  And this is the move that he alluded to.   The reason I didn't play this is that there is also a saying that ""To take is a mistake.""  One time I had a somewhat similar position in my game against easy19.  He had a R en-prise and I took it.  By doing so I lost because the K was exposed.  I thought that would happen later on if I played that because I was worried that there was a potential though not an immediate threat that the Q would come down and the d pawn would advance and create problems around the K.  That however is not the case.  Instead this is where I missed the opportunity win a R for a N with 16.Nxc8! which was best.  Playing that would have left black clinging as he put it.  But the reason that I did not make that move  is because I still thought that to taking would be a costly mistake.  The reason I played this was not to win a Q or the a pawn which it appears; as I wouldn't make that move just for that against a player like ION because it would be unsound and would be refuted.  The real idea was to prevent black from making threats with his Q.  If I took the R after taking back  I thought because I analyzed and based on my assessment I believe that black would've played 17...g5 and would keep advancing the g and h pawns and keep them connected and then the Q would come down and pose as a threat to white.  I didn't want to allow that so the idea is that in order to protect both the a pawn and Q and after asking what he could do the only option is what he plays next.  And by keeping that Q on b8 the structure around my K is safe for now.  "

Best was 22.Nc4  22...Ra4 23.c3 Ra2 24.Nxb6 Nxe4 25.Bb1 Ra1 26.f3 Ng3 27.Nd7 Qc7 28.Ne5 Kg8 29.c4  I disagree with the analysis.  And as we know sometimes the analysis is wrong.  I feel that this is so.  The reason I'm not going by it is that I don't why they're suggesting these moves so there not as much theory to understand since theory is the why questions.  Having said that I think this is best and that's why I played it.  The idea is we will exchange immediately.  And as noted the idea is exchange when up against a stronger opponent.
1495,39,12,2c3,b'3r4/1b2npk1/pp1qpnpp/8/1P1NP3/2PBQ2P/3N1PP1/R5K1 b - -',The idea behind this was to achieve a solid pawn structure or pawn chain.  But this isn't a good move at all. ?? Computer gives it as a mistake but after what they outline I view it as a blunder not just a mistake.  The idea now is that with best play from white I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn after his next move.  Best was 24.N4f3  24...Qxb4 25.Rb1 Qc3 26.Qxb6 Rd7 27.Rb3 Qc6 28.e5 Nfd5 29.Qd4 Kg8 30.Qh4 Nf5 31.Bxf5 exf5 32.Qxh6 Qxc2 and everything is still even.

I figured that now I'm in trouble after the use of Analyze the Board.  But I thought this move would bail me out.  Terrible miscalculation on my part.  And I saw ahead and anticipated what happened but there was another defender that I overlooked this time his R.  With that this backfired what I had analyzed.  No matter he's going to be 2 points ahead but this move loses another pawn.  Having said all of that best was 25.Qe1  25...Nh5 26.Nc4 Qf6 27.Nxe5 Qxe5 28.Bxa6 Qxe4 29.Bxb7 Qxb7 30.Qe5+ Nf6 31.Qg3 Ned5 32.Nf5+ Kh7 33.Nd6
1497,39,14,exf2+,b'3r4/1b2npk1/pp1N1npp/4P3/1P6/2PB3P/5pP1/R5K1 w - -',?! Mistake according to the computer but I give it however as an inaccuracy.  The idea is to promote the pawn of course.  And usually that's how it happens with no way to stop it.  But that's not so here because he doesn't have anything right in front.  Generally speaking it's the R which is where putting the behind a promote that is to promote will often guarantee the win.  However with nothing behind I am going to take it and get a little compensation for lost material.  At least for now.  Having said that best was 27...Ne8 28.Nxb7 Rxd3 29.fxe3 Rd7 30.Nd6 Nxd6 31.exd6 Rxd6 32.e4 b5 33.Kf2 Rd2+ 34.Kf3 Rd3+ 35.Kf4 g5+ 36.Kg4 Nc6 37.Rxa6 Rxc3  
1498,39,15,3g4,b'4r3/1b2npk1/pp4pp/4P3/1P4P1/2PB3P/5K2/R7 b - g3',?? Ok I did consider 30.Bxa6 but I thought he'd take back and now would win a piece for a pawn in addition to what I lost.  So instead I moved the g pawn to strengthen those pawn structures because as I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club you want to try an connect those pawns.  However given that I'm lost I think creatively in order to avoid getting overwhelmed and stressed as that makes the situation and where I make more mistakes.  In fact this is something to that hindered my progress back in the day.  However what I overlooked was my R on a1 so the best move then was to just take winning something back.  But this move however prevents the compensation and in fact loses yet another pawn after what black plays next.
1499,39,16,3c4,b'2b5/5pk1/pp4pp/3nr3/1PP3P1/5B1P/5K2/R7 b - -',? Ok not only was the move a mistake but I did not have a good attitude here.  And it typically happens when I finally realize that I'm fault.  Remember how I learned that unsound aggression and cheapo tactics aren't good unless you're lost and know your opponent can go wrong if they're not careful.  They'll likely see the threat so you do just about anything to stay in.  It's called a defeatistic attitude which is sometimes the wrong approach.  My idea is that since I had absolutely nothing else to lose I'll do anything to stay in.  So I decide to march right after his ION's because once he moved I'd have tempo and could maybe get counterplay.  That's not so.  This kind of thing also happened in my game against Jack about two weeks ago.  I was at a disadvantage and nearly lost so I tried anything to stay in.  That time I went for an easy to drive off mate threat knowing that he had a strong edge.  I figured that I was lost and so there was nothing else to lose.  But I had to think defensively as opposed to aggressively.  He said that had I done that the game might have still ended in a draw.  But the approach I took lost instantly.  So the idea is that no matter how bad the situation even if you're lost sometimes you have to think defensively as opposed to aggressively.  This is now something that I emphasize to students because I realize that this is a common where sometimes you're aggressive because you're lost but thinking defensively is what you have to do instead.  And the way to remember it is what pawntificator said in the WTWLTR which is not to have a defeatistic attitude because as we know it's not over until it's over.  Having said all of that this move loses yet another pawn.  So without further adue best was 33.Rd1 in this position.  33...Be6 34.Bxd5 Rxd5 35.Ra1 Rd3 36.Rxa6 Rxh3 37.Rxb6 Rxc3 38.b5 Bxg4 39.Rc6 Rf3+ 40.Kg1 Bd7 41.Rc5
1500,39,17,4Rc6,b'8/5pk1/2R3pp/4r3/2b3PP/p2n1BK1/8/8 b - -',"?? The ultimate blunder.  Yes the game was lost but this loses immediately however.  The idea here since I make that mistake of being aggressive rather then defensive is march right after the B.  I know he won't allow it but now even if ""To take is a mistake"" I do so anyway since the position is dire.  Normally this is where I used to resign given that the a pawn is going to promote with no way to stop it.  But first wrecking_ball emphasizes never to resign even with the promotion because you don't know.  On one or two occasions on smaller scales though he's been put in situations similar to this but played on and win when all hope was more or less gone.  And I had a very similar position in my game against Jack last week.  Though we both had both the R's.  But the same idea.  After blundering away a piece within the first ten moves he was ahead a pawn and a piece.  But this time with two passed pawns.  One very nearly promoted.  I was black so his pawn was on the third rank then.  So that's lost generally speaking.  But against all odds he made a mistake allowing me to skewer his R.  So when I placed him in check I got that R back.  And after that white could no longer win so I was able to draw in what was a hopelessly lost position.  So as GM JP outlines ...""Fight til it's over.""   It's also because when I did the WTW games I didn't and still don't follow just those rules which says you can resign when you think you're lost.  Instead I follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk which is the equivalent to the original WTW rules you don't resign until mate is inevitable.  I like that rule and generally will follow it.  With it the reason this loses instantly now is that with best play black has a mate in 8.  So best was 40.Rb7 40...a2 41.Ra7 Re3 42.Kg2 Ne1+ 43.Kf2 Rxf3+ 44.Kxe1 Rf6 45.Ra5 Ra6 46.Rxa2 Rxa2 47.h5 f5 48.gxf5 Re2+ 49.Kf1 gxf5  "
1501,39,18,4Rxc4,b'8/5pk1/6pp/4r3/2R3PP/3n1BK1/p7/8 b - -',?? There's only way to stop an immediate promotion 41.Rc6  But even so black answers with 41.Nc5  So it'll promote sooner or later that's before I found out that black actually had mate.  So at this point I regained a little confidence back and seeing how lost I was given that he'd promote anyway I decided to take his B since there be one less thing that black has.  Big mistake though as after black promotes it'll be mate in 4.  So best was to play the immediate 41.Ra6
1502,39,19,Re3+,b'8/5pk1/2B3pp/8/2R3PP/3nr2K/5q2/8 w - -',Seeing that black has a mate in one because the K is stuck and can't move so the only option is 44.Bf6 after which comes 44...Rxf3# I resign at this point.  In order to prevent this the K would've had to escape and I've studied similar positions with GM games.  What I learned here is to ask yourself when taking is a mistake.  Sometimes even against much stronger players that isn't so.  And in some cases no matter how bad the situation even if you think or are lost it's important to think defensively as opposed to aggressively.  Overall I would like to thank archduke_piccolo for giving me this game.
