4,0,4,2Re2,b'4r1k1/pp2rppp/2pQbn2/1qN5/8/2P3P1/PP2RPBP/R5K1 b - -',He obviously intended to stack rooks but missed my queen on the diagonal. In addition attempting to stack them on the file I controlled was less than ideal.
5,0,5,2Qxe2,b'4r1k1/pp2rppp/2pQbn2/2N5/8/2P3P1/PP2qPBP/R5K1 w - -',and now he's five points down.

Here is my return match against Coach Ion in the Traxler MT.  I will be annotating that one two but this one is quite fascinating because although I lost this match there were so many pieces on both sides that were en prise!  This will be a good lesson in tactics to us all including myself The Beginner.   Here is the link to the game which has Gameknot Analysis:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14875035&fb=1&rnd=0.8882096860666713  I will start the commentary on Move 5."
159,7,1,Bxf2+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',5. ...... Bxf2+ - this has become the standard response to the knight fork.  Both Qe7 and Nxe4 (sacrificing the queen) have been tried in the Gameknot DB.  Qe7 has transposed back into the main line however.
160,7,2,d5,b'r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/2n2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w q d6',7. ....... d5 - another standard move opening up the diagonal of Fou Leblanc.

166,7,8,2Nxe5,b'r4k2/p5pp/4b3/4N3/8/2P5/PP1P1KPP/n1B4R b - -',21. Nxe5 - I knew that my e pawn was gonna fall so I thought I would trade it.  But my minor pieces become trapped on the queenside.
167,7,9,Bb3,b'r4k2/p5pp/8/4N3/3P4/1bP5/1P3KPP/n1B4R w - -',22. ..... Bb3 - wrong piece methinks.  In retro the knight should have gone to this square.

169,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Annotation updated November 15 2010. This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes between myself Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend (starforce49). So I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess my favorite game. First I want to say there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men ""OK there are 10000 of us. I want 9000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9000 at the top attack them by bow and arrow. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say ""When you engage in hand to hand combat use the long swords as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though."" That is a tactic not a strategy. Strategies give general direction tactics are more specific. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say ""This guys is leading you wrong."" It's not that I'm leading you wrong but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive! So when taking advise (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible then make a rational decision for yourself based on your own style and abilities what is for you."
170,8,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So 1. e4 e6 marks the Pirc Defense a very tactical defense filled with potential for both sides. As the moves developed we moved far away from the Pirc Defense.
171,8,2,1Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/1bn5/3p1pB1/1P1Pn3/P1N2N1P/2P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"Here you did not notice that I had a knight attacking the g5 square thus you give up a piece. We had 7 days per move so there really is very little reason for quick rushed moves. I'd suggest analyzing very in depth to see what is attacked and defended before making each move.

A one piece advantage is usually more than enuf to win."
172,8,3,1Nxd5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/1bn5/3N1pq1/1P1P4/P6P/2P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So here you get a pawn back in exchange for the piece. Still a won game for me.

When your opponent is ahead in material (in this case a knight) it only leads to an endgame where you are behind. If we keep trading equal items I will have a knight lead in the end game. Your best chance for a win or a draw is to aggressively try to win back material.

In addition you get doubled pawns after the trade. They are bad because they can't defend each other."
175,8,6,Ne7,b'8/1pp1nrk1/1p6/1P4p1/P2PRpr1/2P2R2/5KP1/8 w - -',So my biggest advantage is the knight lead so I need to bring him to where he can do damage on the kingside.
176,8,7,Rg3,b'8/1pp2rk1/1p6/1P4p1/P1PPRp1n/6r1/5RP1/6K1 w - -',I moved the rook forward so that I can push the f-pawn.
177,8,8,3Re4,b'8/1pp2rk1/1p6/1P1P1n2/P1P1R1p1/5p2/5Rr1/5K2 b - -',Always watch out for the forks.

287,14,6,1h3,b'rn1qk2r/ppp5/3p1p2/5bpp/2PP4/4P1BP/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I'm still not sure if I should have played h4 here but I was still looking at castling king side at this point

290,14,9,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pppnq3/3p1p2/6pp/2PP4/3QP1BP/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now we have an interesting position. Blacks advanced pawns on the kings side could pose a threat so I need to make threats of my own queen side. I can feel a pawn storm coming on
291,14,10,Qf7,b'2kr3r/pppn1q2/3p1p2/6p1/P1PP3p/3QP2P/1P3PPB/R4RK1 w - -',To me Rg8 looks better

304,15,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Queen's gambit can be fun...to watch! I do not enjoy this particular opening regardless of the color I play as it seems much too solid if one plays ordinary moves.
305,15,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Standard.
306,15,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Not so popular for good reason as the invitation for d5 is rather tempting and hard to dislodge for black.
307,15,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p4n2/2pP4/P1p5/2N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So far my main task is simply to take the pawn on d5. However white has enough to defend it and so it looks like he has the advantage for the opening as I will have to plant my undeveloped knight on d7 and suffer spacial disadvantages.
308,15,4,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2pP4/P1p1P3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',White has made it clear that d5 is going no where. There is simply no way for me to take the pawn after white plays Bxc4.
309,15,5,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/2pP4/P1p1n3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',!? In blitz it is hard to see if a move is solid. This move seemed the only way to not die a slow strategic death. 8. dxe Qxd1+ 9. Nxd1 Bxe6 and I am up two pawns.
310,15,6,1Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p3b3/2pp4/P1p5/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?? This is a very natural move but has consequences.

312,15,8,1Nfg5,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1b3/2p3N1/P1p1N3/3p4/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',13. Be3 seems like a better choice as my bishop is somewhat passive and white is behind on development. Maybe he was planning Bg2. 
313,15,9,1Nd4,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p3b3/2p3N1/P1pnN3/3p4/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White simply has no way to parry Nc2+

315,15,11,1Kd2,b'r2qkb1r/1p4pp/p3p3/2p5/P1pnN3/3p4/1P1K1PPP/R1BQ1B1R b kq -',? I don't understand this move. Help?
316,15,12,Qd4#,b'r3kb1r/1p4pp/p3p3/2p5/P1pqN3/1nKp4/1P3PPP/R1BQ1B1R w kq -',A rather pretty mate if you ask me! 
317,16,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My opponent starts with Reti's move
318,16,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',I play a common reply. Afterwards on the databases I found that Nf6 is actually more popular although d5 scores better.
319,16,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Reti used to continue with c4. g3 is the most common move here d4 is second followed by c4
320,16,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',This looked the most aggressive the best chance to seize the initiative. Nf6 c6 and e6 are all more common.
321,16,4,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This seemed to me to be a passive reply. Afterwards I found that c4 and e3 are more popular and score better.
322,16,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This seemed best I didn't like the idea of him taking on c5 and following up with b4.
323,16,6,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This again is rather passive. Bf4 e3 and Bg5 are more popular and in my view better.
324,16,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I thought it logical to bring out this knight although Nf6 is slightly more popular.
325,16,8,Bg2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The logical follow-up to his last move.
326,16,9,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I decided to delay the development of this bishop I was dreaming of maybe playing Ne7 0-0 f6 and e5.
327,16,10,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Again logical development by white
328,16,11,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I wish I had had the courage to continue with my plan. There are two games on the database with this both black wins! At the time I was worried about white getting in an early e4
329,16,12,Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',So white pins the knight
330,16,13,h6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/2pp2B1/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black attacks the bishop

384,18,17,4Kf3,b'3r4/2r5/3kp3/p2p2PR/5P2/2p1PK2/P7/2R5 b - -',This move has a tripple purpose. 1) To move toward the pawn on C3; 2) To clear the file so the rook can get to h2 and; 3) To advance to support the g-passer.

I know the rule that in rook versus rook and pawn endings that if the king can get to the queening square it is a draw and so since his king is in position to get to A8 and I would have to untangle I figured I'd take the points. Maybe I should have played on for another 20 moves to see what happened but I didn't have much of a plan other than to move the rook to A6 boxing in his king but I really didn't see how I could bring my king into play assumintg he placed his rook at g4.

Still I got my highest draw on GK. I'll take it. Hopefully I will be back in the Advance sections in the future. These Experts are killers and this is coming from a Class A USCF OTB player. "

At the same time I removed the d6 pawn which impeded my a4 knight from going to c5. Starting to smell a quick mate here although I knew my opponent saw this and would defend. I still think Ne7 may have been the best reply by my opponent. They really need to castle asap!

403,20,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',AlrightI decided to play d4. I used to play d4 all the time before but now i prefer e4. after you play d4 so many times you get tired of it and e4 has so many different variations that you wanna try. I tried switching to englishlooking up some satisfactionary main lines but I judged that they are to similar to d4 openings and I usually run out of ideas in english.
404,20,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Normal move. I have met c5 (old benoni) d5 (Queens gambit after 2.c4) and e6 (usually transposes into Nimzo-indian) and one time i played against g6. I had the advantage but i made a misstake movei went for a combination and over-looked a move which completely won. It was a real game and my opponent had 2036 in rating.
405,20,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Normal move. You can also play 2. Bg5that's the ''Trompovsky attack'' however i have studdied in trompovsky and figured out that black gets a better game if he knows his stuff in that opening i mean i play as black 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4 with unclear positions even tho i think black gets the advantage. 2.e3 and 2.c3 is a bit passive since c4 grips the d5 square. 2.c3 also prevents that knight from developing to c3. I think you can also play 2.Nf3 with the idea of delaying c4 a move just to confuse your enemy a little bit. It worked well against me.
406,20,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',black can play c5 (modern benoni) or g6 (grunfeld/KID) as well. This looks Nimzo-indian like. But it doesnt have to be a Nimzo-indian even tho it looks to me the most popular setup in this position. It can become a Queens-indian and even a Modern Benoni again after 3. ... c5. So yeahagain this is book so far.
407,20,4,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I enjoyed playing the Catalan (3. g3) beforedespite that i usually played wrong moves in the opening ^^. White can also play Nc3 and Nf3 in this position. both are different main lines.
408,20,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black plays normal here. he can also play c5that's also a variation.
409,20,6,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',inviting black to take the c-pawn. The advantage is that i get a big diagonal for my bishoppressuring that b7 square.
410,20,7,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black chose not to take the pawn. If he takes it is a Catalan Open. If he doesn't it's called Catalan Closed. but he can take that pawn latertransposing it into a catalan open.
411,20,8,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',It is neccessary to develop that knight. It looks like it is blocking the g2 bishop but the knight can go to e5 in some occasions.
412,20,9,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Alright Both of us castles. So far it's book. Look at this position. I enjoy this position as white. the way white's king is so well protected by three pieces and 4 pawns and has two center pawns dealing with the center.
413,20,10,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - c6',i think c5 is a main line move. Black can also play the more normal 6. ... dxc4 7. Qc2 a6 8.Qxc4 b5 9.Qc2 Bb7. I think this is a main line move too. It was a while i played against it.
414,20,11,Nc3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Simpel development.
415,20,12,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2Pp4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And black decided to clarify the situation. i think Nc6 is also a move.
416,20,13,Nxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',If white takes with the queen black wins tempo with Nc6. Now we can also see that white frees the g2 bishop.
417,20,14,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Okay. I haven't read any main line that goes like this. From here i tried to play as good as i can.
418,20,15,cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3P4/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Boy i dont know. i think leaving that c-pawn there might have been better. The point of this move is to give black the isolated queens pawn.

Rc1 and we see how well i cover the black squares and stop that passed-backwards-c-pawn. the game went on 14. ... Rc8 15.Nc5 Qe7 16. Qd4 with a small advantage to white (i went on to win that game). I decided that i wanted to try something else in this position and e4 looks fine to me.
420,20,17,1Bc5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/3NP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Bc5. Uhi think it's an okay moveit's diffcult to judge for me but after...

424,20,21,1Bb6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/3N4/3pP3/1N4P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Probably the best move but now comes...

426,20,23,1h6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/1bn2n1p/3N2B1/3pP3/1N4P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',i think 13. ... Re8 was slightly better.

431,20,28,1Kh7,b'r1bqr3/pp3p1k/1bn2p1B/8/3pPP2/1N4P1/PP4BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',i think black would be better of with f5. He obviously didnt see that. because now...

433,20,30,1Rh8,b'r1bq3r/pp3p1k/1bn2p1B/7Q/3pPP2/1N4P1/PP4BP/R4RK1 w - -',well this was probably not the best move. But i dont see a good move for black in this position anyways. 17. ... Rg8?? would be answered by 18. Bf8+! with mate on the next move.

체스에서 처음 목표에는 크게 3가지가 있어~ 
1. piece development - 피스들을 빨리 꺼내는 거야. 나잇은 꺼내기가 쉽지만 비숍이랑 룩은 처음 상태로는 움직일 수 없지~ 그래서 폰을 움직일 필요가 있어. 
2. 공간 장악하기? 중앙을 컨트롤하는 게 중요해~ 여기서 완전 중앙은 d4 d5 e4 e5 이렇게 네 개이지만 그 주변을 둘러싼 칸들도 중요하고. 그래서 처음에 d/e폰을 움직이는 게 일반적이고 이걸 또 피스들로 뒷받침해주는 거지~ 
3. King safety - 킹은 가운데에 그대로 있으면 공격 타겟이 되니까 캐슬링으로 옮기는거.. 물론 캐슬링을 안 하는게 더 안전한 경우도 있지만 많지는 않아.

그래서 1.h4는 가장자리에 있는 폰을 옮기는 건데 1/3에는 도움이 안 되고 2에는 도움이 되는 듯.. 하지만 보통 킹 쪽에 있는 룩은 어차피 캐슬링한 다음에 자유로워지니까 굳이 h폰을 올릴 필요는 없지~"

541,26,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This opening is called the queen's gambit. It is one of my favorites now that I have started playing 1. d4.  
542,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This variation is one you do not see every day. I'm more used to e6 dxc4- queen's gambit accepted or c6- Slav. I guess this is playable though. Dxc5 would fail to D4 clogging up white's development. 
543,26,2,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2PQ4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Although white gains time while attacking d5 his queen is soon destined to get chased away. I would rather capture that way than 4. exd4 though

555,26,14,Bc5,b'r6r/pppk1ppp/8/2b2b2/2P5/2N5/PPn1KnPP/1RB2BNR w - -',Black didn't need to capture the rook immediately because is it going anywhere? He instead decided to continue developing. Now his rooks can go to the open files in 1 move!
556,26,15,1Nf3,b'r6r/pppk1ppp/8/2b2b2/2P5/2N2N2/PPn1KnPP/1RB2B1R b - -',This move could have 50 question marks after it because he just made the biggest mistake of the game. You will see why. It is a mate in 2 thanks to that knight! Can you spot it?

672,30,2,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And that's as far as the Gameknot Opening DB goes. However the next 3 moves are quite common in this opening and even played by higher rated players

Attacking the center getting the pawns to point towards the kingside actually I think I planned to do c4 as the next move but apparently I didn't...

However this move is still playable (as has been played by Certic who did c4 as the next step and Fant who went on with Nb1d2 before doing c4). "
675,30,5,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/8/1P1P1N2/PBPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq c6',Now my position starts to get cramped leaving the control over the board and the initative to black. A possible way to continue would be to fianchetto the second bishop ot build up bigger pressure on the center.

Both knights are places in the center I'm clearly ahead in development black hasn't castled yet his bishops aren't well placed... But I had one big problem: I had no plan what I should be going to do...

702,31,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My guide in this opening is Greek GM Vasilios Kotronias whose book Beating the Caro-Kann advocates the Advance Variation. Unfortunately my memory of the intricate variations is not as good as it could be so don't be surprised if I stray from the chosen path...  Last week I watched a different approach on a neighbouring board so may try that next time.

Ng3 were my main alternatives but I haven't had great success with thse so thought it time to give this a go.  White's move attacks the Black wsb while freeing White's own and putting the N on an attractive-looking square.
709,31,8,1Bd3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnppb/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P1NPP/2NBB3/PPP2P2/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The logic behind this is to cause Black to swap off a piece in which he has already invested 3 tempi for one in which White has apparently invested just the one but of course it's not as simple as that.  The moves that White expended to force Black to spend those tempi were mostly weakening pawn moves.  That said White's position looks pretty good at this stage: minor pieces on good-looking squares whereas Black's look cramped.
710,31,9,1Qxd3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P1NPP/2NQB3/PPP2P2/R3K2R b KQkq -',Now all White has to do is find a plan ... whereas Black's is almost self-evident.
711,31,10,1O-O-O,b'r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/3P1NPP/2NQB3/PPP2P2/2KR3R b kq -',? Though this looked reasonable at the time it was quickly made to look stupid.  Black's attack develops naturally thanks to the flexible disposition of his pieces and pawns.  I haven't decided whether castling kingside or not castling at all would have been better.  Perhaps the latter.
712,31,11,1Nfe2,b'r3kb1r/1pqnnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/3P2PP/2NQB3/PPP1NP2/2KR3R b kq -',The knight was in the way of my f-pawn on f4 and of my B on e3.  It also provides additional cover for the N on c3.
713,31,12,1c5,b'r3kb1r/1pqnnpp1/p3p2p/2ppP3/3P2PP/2NQB3/PPP1NP2/2KR3R w kq -',c5 finally arrives and threatens to embarrass White's Q by advancing again when Black's dsb will threaten to leap into the attack once the Ne7 has moved to the recently vacated c6 square.
714,31,13,1f4,b'r3kb1r/1pqnnpp1/p3p2p/2ppP3/3P1PPP/2NQB3/PPP1N3/2KR3R b kq f3',White attempts to pursue his kingside attack but it's all too slow.  There's nothing really to bite on - or with.
715,31,14,1a3,b'r3kb1r/1pqn1pp1/p1n1p2p/3pP3/2pP1PPP/P1N1B3/1PPQN3/2KR3R b kq -',Although this discourages Black's minor pieces from coming to b4 it also creates a weakness at b3
716,31,15,1f5,b'r3kb1r/2qn1pp1/p1n1p2p/1p1pPP2/2pP2PP/P1N1B3/1PPQN3/2KR3R b kq -',I was still managing to feel quite optimistic at this point though I knew my opponent was quite capable of dealing with me (he beat me last season)

718,31,17,Qa5,b'r3k2r/3n2p1/p1n1p2p/q2pP3/1bpP1NPP/2N1B3/1PPQ4/2KR3R w kq -',!  Now the threat of Qa1+ is devastating.
719,31,18,2Qf2,b'r3k2r/3n2p1/p1n1p2p/q2pP3/1bpP1NPP/2N1B3/1PP2Q2/2KR3R b kq -',White relieves the pin on the N so that it can block the check on b1 but worse is to follow..
720,31,19,2Nfe2,b'r3k2r/3n2p1/p1n1p2p/3pP3/1bpP2PP/2N1B3/1qPKNQ2/3R3R b kq -',That N keeps bobbing back and forth achieving little: but I had to defend c3 right?  Otherwise Qxc3 was forced mate I thought.  However 23. Nxe6 Qxc3+ 24. Ke2 Qxc2+ 25. Kf3 Qe4+ 26. Kg3 might have offered some respite with White's Ne6 offering some counter-chances.
721,31,20,2Rf8,b'r3kr2/3n2p1/p1n1p2p/3pP3/1bpP2PP/2N1B3/1qPKNQ2/3R3R w q -',Another nasty move.  I thought my response was quite clever but was quickly disabused of that notion.

724,32,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Usual Sicilian Opening

727,32,3,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Interestingly the GameKnot db states: bxc6 good dxc6 bad... so it seems like the right choice (always towards the center although this leaves a an isolated pawn...) This is where the opening DB ends...
728,32,4,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Starting development and a not so uncommon situation with the accelerated dragon

730,32,6,Qxd7,b'r3k1nr/p2qppbp/6p1/3p4/8/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White doing a check that does not change the situation but only simplifies the situation by reducing the remaining pieces. However white is ahead in development for the loss of both central pawns which black wants to exploit

Unfortunately as White's next demonstatrates I have taken away the withdrawal point for my c4 Knight.
906,38,15,d5,b'2k3r1/5p2/1p2p2p/p2p1n2/P1nP1N2/2P5/2b2K1P/R1B2B2 w - -',Defending the Knight and opening d6 again.

908,38,17,3Ke2,b'6r1/1k3p2/1p2p2p/p4n2/P1pPbN2/2P5/1R2K2P/2B5 b - -',I was really wishing I could get his Knight off f4 at this point.
909,38,18,3Re5,b'6r1/5p2/1pknp2p/p3R3/P1pPbN2/2P5/4K2P/2B5 b - -',Exchanging Rooks on the 2nd rank is no longer an option but an exchange on the fifth rank can now be forced.  After reveiwing the board I decided that his h pawn could be handled.
910,38,19,3Nh5,b'8/5p2/1pknp3/p5pN/P1pPb3/2P5/4K2P/2B5 b - -',He discovers attack on my g5 pawn.  
911,38,20,3Bc2,b'8/5p2/1pknp3/p5pN/P1pP4/2P5/2b1K2P/2B5 w - -',I felt (perhaps wrongly) that g4 followed by f4 was too drawish and I had better chances with my queenside pawns (a thought that I needed to pay better attention to later).
912,38,21,Ne4,b'8/5p2/1pk1p3/p5BN/b1pPn2P/2P5/4K3/8 w - -',To force an exchange of my Knight and his Bishop or win a pawn.

914,38,23,4Nf6,b'8/5p2/1p1kpN2/p7/b1pP3P/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',I am not sure where he was headed with this but it provided my King some additional time on his way to the h file.  Perhaps he wanted to keep the diagonal h5-e8 blocked by my pawn.
915,38,24,f5,b'8/4k3/1p2p3/p4p2/b1pP2NP/2P5/3K4/8 w - f6',My King is in position to stop the h pawn and the Bishop now has a way to approach the pawn.
916,38,25,b5,b'8/4k3/4p3/pp2Np2/b1pP3P/2P5/3K4/8 w - -',Which I immediately block!!??
917,38,26,4Nc6,b'6k1/8/2N1p2P/pp3p2/b1pP4/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',So that is where he was headed!! Nothing I can do now but trade pawns.  I think I am getting the better of the deal.
918,38,27,Kg5,b'8/8/4p3/Np3pk1/b1pP4/2P1K3/8/8 w - -',To keep his King from getting thru to e5.  And my Bishop also has an avenue by which it can become active again.
919,38,28,4Nb4,b'8/8/4p3/1p3pk1/1NpP4/2P1K3/2b5/8 b - -',Too late.
920,38,29,Kg4,b'8/8/4p3/1pNb4/2pP1pk1/2P5/5K2/8 w - -',It is around here that my focus has been drawn away from the queenside pawns.
921,38,30,Kh4,b'8/5N2/4p3/1p1b4/2pP1p1k/2P5/5K2/8 w - -',I am still thinking about the f pawn queening.

"
923,38,32,Kh4,b'8/8/4p3/1p1bN3/2pP3k/2P2p2/5K2/8 w - -',After a good deal of analysis I decided that my King had to take a longer route to the other side of the board and that the f pawn's best use would be in exchanging off the minor pieces.
924,38,33,e5,b'8/8/5k2/1p1Pp3/2p1K3/2P5/8/8 w - -',This was the move I found in my analyis that lets me get my King over to the queenside.
925,38,34,6d7,b'8/3P4/4k3/1p2p3/2p1K3/2P5/8/8 b - -',He either advances this pawn or gives it away.
926,38,35,Kc6,b'8/8/2k5/1p2K3/2p5/2P5/8/8 w - -',Now it is just a matter of getting to his c pawn.
927,38,36,7Kd4,b'8/8/8/1p6/k1pK4/2P5/8/8 b - -',This just hastens the c pawn's demise.
928,38,37,Kb3,b'8/8/8/1K6/2p5/1k6/8/8 w - -',The remaining pawn is unstoppable.

930,39,0,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The traxler signature move where black abandon the f pawn for an attack on White's king.
931,39,1,Nxf7,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The knight capture of the f7 pawn also forks the h8 rook and the queen winning material in the process. However time and development are of crucial importance while the material is not. This opening is double-edged as white has the material while black has the position.
932,39,2,Bxf2+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',With this move black drags the white king near the f file where it would be easily attacked by Black's remaining troops.
933,39,3,Kf1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',White chooses the safest option as 6.Kxf2 is met by 6...Nxe4 with a LOT of complications ands tactics down the road.
934,39,4,Nxh8,b'r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q -',White takes my rook. I am now 5 points down in material and my dark square bishop is hanging. Is it lost for black? Absolutely not!
935,39,5,d5,b'r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/2n2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w q d6',I open up lines for my light-square bishop while threatening my opponent's bishop.

938,39,8,Qf8,b'r1b1kq1N/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3Np3/2p1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/R1BQ1K1R w q -',! I place my queen on the same file as the white king which is covered by two of my pieces. If I have the time to remove these pieces I would have a winning attack...

Although it is not considered good to exchange queens in highly tactical openings like this I feel that the position lost its sharpness and dulled out. After the queen excahnge I can easily pick up the h8 knight. However...
944,39,14,Nd4,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2pnP3/3P1P2/PPP4P/R1B2K1R w q -',I also have this fork!
945,39,15,1dxc4,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2PnP3/5P2/PPP4P/R1B2K1R b q -',? Some pawns are good for their rich nutritious values others are not. Unfortunately for white my c4 pawn was not.
946,39,16,1Bh3+,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2PnP3/5P1b/PPP4P/R1B2K1R w q -',! I force the white king to go to a dark square where it will be easily attacked by my knight and my dark-square bishop.
947,39,17,1Kf2,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2PnP3/5P1b/PPP2K1P/R1B4R b q -',Kinda forced as 15.Kg1 is met by the humiliating 15...Nxf3# and 15.Ke1 is met by 15...Nxc2+ winning the rook.
948,39,18,1Nxc2+,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2P1P3/5P1b/PPn2K1P/R1B4R w q -',Discovered check.
949,39,19,1Kg3,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b6/4p3/2P1P3/5PKb/PPn4P/R1B4R b q -',The best move. I can either take the rook or save my bishop.
950,39,20,1Be6,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/5PK1/PPn4P/R1B4R w q -',I choose the later. White has to move his rook.
951,39,21,1Rb1,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/5PK1/PPn4P/1RB4R b q -',White saves the rook but none of his pieces are currently active!
952,39,22,1O-O-O,b'2kr3N/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/5PK1/PPn4P/1RB4R w - -',I free my rook with style.
953,39,23,1b3,b'2kr3N/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/1P3PK1/P1n4P/1RB4R b - -',White somewhat does the same.
954,39,24,1Rxh8,b'2k4r/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/1P3PK1/P1n4P/1RB4R w - -',I take the free knight. I am now +1 in material and I also have a better position.
955,39,25,1Bb2,b'2k4r/ppp3pp/1b2b3/4p3/2P1P3/1P3PK1/PBn4P/1R5R b - -',White brings out his bishop coonects his rooks and attack my e pawn. Good move.

960,39,30,2Ne3+,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/1b2b3/4B3/2P1P2p/1P2nP2/P5KP/1R5R w - -',! White must go into the g1-a7 diagonal where my dark bishop will lend a discovered check when the knight moves.
961,39,31,Bh3,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/1b6/4B3/2P1P2p/1P2nP1b/P6P/1R4KR w - -',! Another zwisenchug. Any knight move leads to mate now...
962,39,32,2Rb2,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/1b6/4B3/2P1P2p/1P2nP1b/PR5P/6KR b - -',?? Kf2 was necessary.
963,39,33,2Nd1+,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/1b6/4B3/2P1P2p/1P3P1b/PR5P/3n2KR w - -',23...Nc2+ is faster but it doesn't matter much at this point. This way my bishop will rush through every defender of the king for the show.
964,39,34,Bxc5+,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/8/2b1B3/4P2p/1P3P1b/PR5P/3n2KR w - -',The pawn goes down...

966,39,36,2Rf2,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/8/8/3bP2p/1P3P1b/P4R1P/3n2KR b - -',An interesting fact about about this position: Only white's pawn can move!
967,39,37,2Bxf2#,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/8/8/4P2p/1P3P1b/P4b1P/3n2KR w - -',Finally the rook goes down along with the king. 0-1
