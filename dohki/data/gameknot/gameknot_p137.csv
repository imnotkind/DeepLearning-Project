2,0,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I prefer a sideline from the mostly played d4 to keep some pressure on the knight and to populate the centre with my pawns by playing c4 (the Steiner variation) now I plan also to play at some time Nc3 not hampering the c pawn development.
3,0,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',c4 is protected by Bf1 so d4 is the natural way of progress to populate the centre with pawns psicologicaly is also interesting to contrapose the hyper-modernist ideas behind 1...Nf6 with the more classical approach of gaining space in the center.

8,0,8,Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n1p4/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',further development is needed although with more space I lack developed pieces My Nc3 looks good behind the pawns as with the early c4 I gained more space in the centre

dxe5 is not better although regaining some material back allows for Bxb7 attacking the rook and after Rb8 then c6 protects the bishop and creates havoc in black's field"

Black's lack of space the king in the centre and uncoordinated pieces allowed for some nice tactics that at least would have allowed white to win a piece it turned quickly in to a bunch of pieces and the game."
21,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1.e4 remaining as the all time favourite move to begin the game with no matter are you beginner or grandmaster you are going to face this best-by-test move more than any other opening move. But back to the game my opponent decided to go for this instead of playing 1.d4 which was his main opening move(I would have tried to go for kings indian defence if that would have happened).
22,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My main defence against e4. I play other moves here too but it is a good rule when facing a stronger opponent on paper to go for the opening which you know the best.
23,1,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',My absolute favourite of all times Dragon variation which is also regarded as one of the most complicated openings employed in modern practice. Back in early days of Dragon the moves to begin with were much more different: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 and after 6. Be2 g6 black would have successfully got where he wanted(move order was developed from avoiding c2-c4 marcozy bind and attacking move e4-e5 when they were used against the imaginary d6 e7 g6 h7 formation resembling Dragon constellation). Modern move order was found after response 6.Bg5 against old move order cause 6...g6? 7.Bxf6 exf6 is no good.
24,1,3,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This move(we should say formation f2-f3 Bc1-e3 Qd1-d2 0-0-0 cause Rauzer started it with 6.f3) was first demonstrated by well-known player Vsevolod Rauzer. It is beginning of organised attack on the kingside with already mentioned formation.
25,1,4,f3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack) white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside. Less common replies in use here are 7...Nc6 and 7...a6(which are sometimes called anti-rauzer cause black delays castling counting on other benefits like first bringing pieces on queenside where white intends to castle).
26,1,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',"Most common reply ""Come on I am not afraid of your attack on king's flank"". Black is going to trust on his counterplay which he can get from queenside."
27,1,6,Qd2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',"There remains continuation 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Qe2 which is just ""wrong"" cause true spirit of Yugoslav attack is to go and see who checkmates first! But the continuation I gave there is to go up against blacks counterplay on queenside."
28,1,7,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black is ready for the battle counterblow in the center that is. So white is going to either allow it by playing 9. 0-0-0 prevent it by 9.Bc4 or be a haymaker and go for 9.g4.
29,1,8,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Some call this a modern approach of this opening as after many games and research done with the move 9. 0-0-0 this is regarded as the best shot by white to get the advantage in game(keep in mind that in openings you never know when old moves come into fashion again. There is surely room for new ideas in 0-0-0 variation you just have to find them). This move is to prevent any ...d6-d5 plans while developing light-squared bishop to its most active diagonal. So what white is planning then? Long castle h2-h4-h5 Be3-h6 if needed launching attack against black king.
30,1,9,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Alright I am not going into details with other possibilities as 9...Nxd4 9...Nd7 9...Na5 9...a6 or 9...a5(if this would be introduction of opening then yes). Bishop move ...Bd7 is a flexible choice in this position black has lot of possibilities. For example there is knight manoeuvre possibility ...Nc6-e5-c4(without developing queen before it cause simply saving tempo).
31,1,10,1O-O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',And white continues the plan I introduced. If you want to try something else here then go for 10.Bb3 cause immediate 10.h4 Rc8 11.Bb3 Ne5 leads to transposition(unless you are planning to delay castling then maybe some difference).
32,1,11,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Black has to start working on his own counterplay queenside. There is nothing else now that we have come here so thematic c-file control in sicilian is a great way to start it.
33,1,12,1Bb3,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',I don't believe there is much anything else. 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bb3 is not recommended as it doesn't give anything and black can even sacrifice pawn for an initiative: 12...b5!? 13.Bxa7 Qa5 14.Bd4 b4 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nd5 Bxd5 17. exd5 Rc5 and chances are usually on the side of player who is having more active bishop in cases where bishops are different colour included with other pieces on board.
34,1,13,1Ne5,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',"And continuing with manoeuvre plan aiming for c4. White has now option to go for interesting 12.Kb1 which is prophylactic king move(when I was younger we used to joke about these as ""GM moves""). Other interesting possibility is to play 12. Bg5 where white wants to play e4-e5 break cause of a pin on d-file. Main continuation is 12.h4 which we shall see in the game."
35,1,14,1h4,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - h3',Flank attack following the spirit of this opening and starting the attack against black king.
36,1,15,1h5,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n2p/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - h6',Black weakens his castled position which should not be done if following general rules. Reason of this move is not to prevent g2-g4 advance cause it will come at some point anyway. But the reason is to delay it and make white to prepare it first. Question is: Can black achieve anything during that duration. 12...a5 is another move reducing blacks possibilities and 12...Nc4 is played here frequently.
37,1,16,1Bg5,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - -',Here white had several possibilites: 13. g4 13. Kb1 13. Bh6 13. Rhe1 leading to a different game. White goes to threaten knight protecting g2-g4 break and also narrows blacks counterplay possibilities.
38,1,17,1Rc5,b'3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/2r1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',Now this is interesting move which needs an explanation. Here has been tried 13...Nc4 but it doesn't look promising after 14. Qe2 Na5 15. Kb1 and white is happy to set attack on the kingside(1-0 Nunn - Mestel London 1986 can be taken as example game). This rook move is unusual in Dragon but wonderful possibility in this position prepares b7-b5 and scouts important squares on 5th rank.
39,1,18,1Kb1,b'3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/2r1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b - -',14.f4 and 14.g4 are other two moves used here which are more like risking everything. King move is safer option but useful one at this point. Other options let black too easily to get counterplay with knight manoeuvre e5-c4.
40,1,19,1b5,b'3q1rk1/p2bppb1/3p1np1/1pr1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - b6',Preparation is done so I started my play on queenside by pushing a pawn.
41,1,20,1g4,b'3q1rk1/p2bppb1/3p1np1/1pr1n1Bp/3NP1PP/1BN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - g3',Yeah! This is what Dragon should be typical plan in opposite-castled position you have to be first with the attack!
42,1,21,1a5,b'3q1rk1/3bppb1/3p1np1/ppr1n1Bp/3NP1PP/1BN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - a6',Instead of going 15...hxg4 the sharpest continuation and where every move values extremely high I decided to go for other accepted idea here which is to get a-pawn threaten bishop while it's not the only reason. Other plan is to get a-pawn to a3 and open up diagonal h8-a1 for bishop in some scenarios.
43,1,22,1gxh5,b'3q1rk1/3bppb1/3p1np1/ppr1n1BP/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',All makes sense white continues his attack.
44,1,23,1a4,b'3q1rk1/3bppb1/3p1np1/1pr1n1BP/p2NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',16...Nxh5 would be the other move here which is a passive method dealing against whites attack by defending. Most likely the move played here offers better possibilities for black to actually do something.
45,1,24,1h6,b'3q1rk1/3bppb1/3p1npP/1pr1n1B1/p2NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',From what I heard this move is nowadays considered as intermediate move. The move which is considered to be stronger move is not hard to find that is 17.Bxf7(Schmidt - Varga Germany 1991 white got strong attack with 17.Bxf7 Kxf7 18.hxg6+ Nxg6 19.h5 Ne5 20.Qg2 Rg8 21.h6 Bh8 22.f4 Nc4 23.Qh2 Nxb2 24.Rdg1 Rxc3 25.h7 Rg6 26.f5 Rxg5 27.Rxg5).

48,1,27,a3,b'3q1rkb/3bpp1n/3p2p1/1prBn1B1/3NP2P/p1N2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',Okay now this is some sort of novelty. Move that has been tried here instead of this is 19...b4 where black should be doing just fine. But as I mentioned earlier this move is to increase power of dark-squared bishop(and yes it does some damage around whites king) so idea to play this came quite naturally into my head in this game. How much I spent thinking the move 19...b5 as I do have some analysed lines in my old notes... well I can still remember this like yesterday that I was simply too excited to find out where 19...a3 leads and didn't spend much time on 19...b5(I want to show you funny execution in here 19...Qc7 20.Bxe7 Re8 21.h5 Rxe7 22.hxg6 Nxg6 23.Rdg1 Nhf8 24.Nf5 Bxf5 25.exf5 Bxc3 26.fxg6 Re1+ 27.Qxe1 Rxd5 28.Qe4 Qc4 29.Qe8 fxg6 30.bxc3 g5 31.Rh8+ Kxh8 32.Qxf8+ Kh7 33.Qf7+ 1-0 and German player Hausrath was defeated in fashion by the best ranked player from Estonia nowadays Kaido Kulaots in wch U16 1992)
49,1,28,e6,b'3q1rkb/3b1p1n/3pp1pB/1prBn3/3NP2P/p1N2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',I didn't like 20...Re8 21.h5 e6 22.hxg6 Nxg6 23.Bb3 axb2 24.Rdg1 which seems to give white good chances. So instead I went for ...e6 immediately and maybe lose the exchange but this path seems to give black possibilities(certainly better than 20...Re8 which asks for trouble).
50,1,29,2Bxf8,b'3q1Bkb/3b1p1n/3pp1p1/1prBn3/3NP2P/p1N2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',White decides to grab the material. 21.Bb3 would have been another choice and its hard to determine which one is the more accurate one between these two(hopefully someone finds the reason). Maybe 21.Bb3 would be the right choice by keeping dark-squared bishop on kingside for possibilities or that is what I have started to believe more I look this position. Problem with 21.Bxf8 seems to be that it just throws the fuel out and white can't create anything but aslong as his bishop stays on board it can be nasty for black. One example would be 21.Bb3 Re8 22.h5 g5 23.f4 b4 24.Nce2 Ng4 25.Bxg5 Nxg5 26.fxg5 Nf2 27.g6 Nxd1 28.gxf7+ Kxf7 29.Rxd1 Qg5 and now white has 30.Qxb4 otherwise it would be better for black but now it leads to whites advantage.
51,1,30,2Bb3,b'3q1nkb/3b1p2/3pp1p1/1pr1n3/3NP2P/pBN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',Now we get to the same point but white doesn't have his bishop and this doesn't look bad for black.
52,1,31,2Bg7,b'3q1nk1/3b1pb1/3pp1p1/1pr1n3/3NP2P/pBN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',Now this looks weird move. The reason why I wanted to do this is that in some scenarios in chess it is not good to give opponent change to do check and develope a piece to good square same time(in here rook to g1 and check same time).
53,1,32,gxh5,b'3q1nk1/3b1pb1/3pp3/1pr1n2p/3NP3/pBN2P2/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',This is already looking dangerous for black(if you look deeper in position you might disagree) but 23...gxh5 is the only option what else and now we see a quite odd thing. Rook that was played to c5 square suddenly eyes this pawn aswell. White can't go for 24.Rxh5 cause black just goes 24...Nxf3 25.Nxf3 Rxh5. From how the game goes on it might be that 24.bxa3 would have been the right move as a-pawn is going to be troublesome in this game.
54,1,33,2f4,b'3q1nk1/3b1pb1/3pp3/1pr1n2p/3NPP2/pBN5/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',?! I just don't know what was going in head of this guy. He decides to change his light-squared bishop to my knight while opening lines front of his king. Maybe he had seen something I didn't? or is it that white doesn't have better ideas like maybe just playing knight to e2 or rook to g1 and I can't see much wrong in those options.
55,1,34,2Bxc4,b'3q1nk1/3b1pb1/3pp3/1pr4p/2BNPP2/p1N5/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',This would make more sense if I take with Rook here: 25...Rxc4 26.e5! and he would get my h-pawn while keeping comfortable position.
56,1,35,2f5,b'3q1nk1/3b1pb1/3pp3/2r2P1p/2pNP3/p1N5/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',? So was this what white planned with f-push? makes even less sense as it doesn't seem to be doing much and I have hard time accepting that title player would go for this. Maybe there were snakes he saw and nobody else did?
57,1,36,2Qb8,b'1q3nk1/3b1pb1/3pp3/2r2P1p/2pNP3/p1N5/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',! This had to be done now. Leading to forced sequence of moves after which black has his dark-squared bishop in great position towards white king and possibilities of using his h-pawn. And when you add the fact that black wins a pawn by clearing white pawns that stand on squares e4 and f5 this is starting to look really good. 
58,1,37,Rxf5,b'1q3nk1/5pb1/3p4/5r1p/8/pPN5/P2Q4/1K1R3R w - -',Now after seeing this position arising it makes me think would it have been any difference if white would have gone 28. axb3 keeping pawn on c2 to maybe(?) prevent ideas against his king.
59,1,38,3Rhg1,b'1q3nk1/5pb1/3p4/5r1p/8/pPN5/P2Q4/1K1R2R1 b - -',Maybe rook would have been better on e-file as black has possibility to just close the g-file now with knight.
60,1,39,3Ng6,b'1q4k1/5pb1/3p2n1/5r1p/8/pPN5/P2Q4/1K1R2R1 w - -',This is beginning of interesting and one of my most successful endgames. There was no reason to accept draw. The truth might be that black can't win this but as so often in games with these kind of chances you might sometimes earn the prize by trying. Black has a3-pawn in nasty position preventing whites play and three passed pawns from which h-pawn should be used in order to make possibility for chances. So maybe the earlier bxa3 would have done good for white(and that f-push included with losing those pawns on center was just terrible).
61,1,40,3Nd5,b'1q4k1/5pb1/3p2n1/3N1r1p/8/pP6/P2Q4/1K1R2R1 b - -',? This might already lead into lost game for white cause of possibility to play 32...Qe8 and when analysed further it seems to be really good for black. 33.Rde1 Re5 34.Nc3 h4 for example is promising. So what else if not 32.Nd5... it seems that rook move 32.Rc1! would be the move that could save the game like if the game would continue 32.Rc1! h4 33.Qd3 Rc5 34.Ne4 Rxc1+ 35.Rxc1 Qe8 36.Qd5 there is good chances for draw. Maybe black has some other possibilities but 32.Rc1! must be strong move here.
62,1,41,3Qb5,b'6k1/5pb1/3p2n1/1q1N1r1p/8/pP6/P2Q4/1K1R2R1 w - -',Straight ...Qe8 was the right plan but this doesn't throw it away yet and black still has possibility to play queen to important e8 square. If white goes for move 33.Rge1 preventing queen from moving to e8 then it seems black can maintain advantage by playing 33...h4 34.Nc7 Qb6 35. Re8+ Kh7 36.Nd5 Qf2 37.Re2 Qg3.
63,1,42,Qe8,b'4q1k1/5pb1/3p2n1/3N1r1p/8/pP6/P5Q1/1K1R2R1 w - -',! Black is probably winning now.
64,1,43,3Rde1,b'4q1k1/5pb1/3p2n1/3N1r1p/8/pP6/P5Q1/1K2R1R1 b - -',Now what else? 34.Rc1!? seems like alternative try but after 34...Qe5 35.Nc3 h4 36.Rc2 there remains another ace 36...d5!
65,1,44,3Re5,b'4q1k1/5pb1/3p2n1/3Nr2p/8/pP6/P5Q1/1K2R1R1 w - -',Only move for example if black goes 34...Qf8 then white gets into the game after 35.Rc1 Kh7 36.Ne3 Re5 37.Qf3 Qe8 38.Nc4 Qe6 39.Nxe5 Qxe5 40.Rg2.
66,1,45,3Qd2,b'4q1k1/5pb1/3p2n1/3Nr2p/8/pP6/P2Q4/1K2R1R1 b - -',Rooks needs to be protected.
67,1,46,3Qe6,b'6k1/5pb1/3pq1n1/3Nr2p/8/pP6/P2Q4/1K2R1R1 w - -',Focing knight to move away from center.
68,1,47,3Nb4,b'6k1/5pb1/3pq1n1/4r2p/1N6/pP6/P2Q4/1K2R1R1 b - -',Forced and now black is winning. Probably 36...Nh4 does the same  thing as the move I played in the game.
69,1,48,3Rxe1+,b'6k1/5pb1/3pq1n1/7p/1N6/pP6/P2Q4/1K2r1R1 w - -',! Absolute stunner!
70,1,49,3Rxe1,b'6k1/5pb1/3pq1n1/7p/1N6/pP6/P2Q4/1K2R3 b - -',Maybe 37. Qxe1 would have been better by simply offering trade of queens to draw the game(if you know you are losing it is sometimes worth trying even stupid stuff). Black of course shouldn't change queens then but instead play 37...Qf6.
71,1,50,3Qf6,b'6k1/5pb1/3p1qn1/7p/1N6/pP6/P2Q4/1K2R3 w - -',Using the power of mighty a1-h8 diagonal.
72,1,51,Qa1+,b'6k1/5pb1/3p2n1/7p/1N6/pP6/P2QR3/qK6 w - -',38...h4 might lead into won game aswell.
73,1,52,Bc3,b'6k1/5p2/3p2n1/7p/1N6/pPb5/Pq1QR3/3K4 w - -',This move had to be made otherwise white manages to hold. For example 40...Qb1+ 41.Qc1 Qxc1+ 42.Kxc1 just throws it away.
74,1,53,axb2,b'6k1/5p2/3p2n1/7p/1N6/1Pb5/Pp2R3/3K4 w - -',Not 41...Bxb2? cause white has rook and this forces white to give knight away.
75,1,54,4Kc2,b'6k1/5p2/3p2n1/7p/1N6/1Pb5/PpK1R3/8 b - -',42.Re8+ Kg7 43.Kc2 Bxb4 44.Kxb2 Ne5 and black wins.
76,1,55,d5,b'6k1/5p2/6n1/3p3p/1b6/1P6/PK2R3/8 w - -',!
77,1,56,4Rc2,b'6k1/5p2/8/3p3p/1b3n2/PP6/1KR5/8 b - -',45.Rh2 can be tried here as it will lead to game where black needs to play carefully if he wants to win the game. So I am going to introduce one long variation right now for that: 45.Rh2!? Bd6 46.Rh1 Be5+ 47.Ka2 Kf8 48.a4 Ke7 49.a5 Kd6 50.Ka3 Kc6 51.Ka4 d4 52.b4 d3 53.b5+ Kb7 54.Kb3 Bc7 55.a6+ Ka7 56.Rh4 f5 57.Kb2 Be5+ 58.Kb3 Ne6 59.Rxh5 Nc5+! 60.Kc4 d2 61.Rh7+ Ka8 62.Rh1 Ne4 63.Rd1 Bf4 64.b6 Nf2 65.Rb1 d1Q 66.Rrxd1 Nxd1 and black wins.
78,1,57,h4,b'6k1/5p2/8/3p4/1P3n1p/P7/1KR5/4b3 w - -',Black must push h-pawn in order to win this.
79,1,58,4Kb3,b'6k1/5p2/8/3p4/1P3n1p/PK6/2R5/4b3 b - -',47.b5 doesn't help anything 47...h3 48.b6 Bg3 saves the day for black.
80,1,59,Nf2,b'6k1/5p2/8/P2p4/1P6/1K4b1/5n1p/7R w - -',This all has been just playing moves out nothing too interesting but now at first it might look that white has brilliant idea which unfortunately doesn't work
81,1,60,5a6,b'6k1/5p2/P7/3p4/1P6/1K4b1/5n1p/7R b - -',White plays his last hope to get a queen on table.
82,1,61,5Nxh1,b'6k1/5p2/P7/3p4/1P6/1K4b1/7p/7n w - -',This had to be played now and not to react whites idea of promoting queen.
83,1,62,5Qxd5,b'8/5p1k/8/3Q4/1P6/1K4b1/5n1p/8 b - -',White is already in position which can be resigned but this good example how to win this position with black and something like this could be found from some endgame manual even(yes I am flattering myself cause I was and still am so happy about this game.)
84,1,63,5h1=Q,b'8/5p1k/8/3Q4/1P6/1K4b1/5n2/7q w - -',No surprise now it is just playing.
85,1,64,Kg1,b'8/1Q6/8/8/1P6/1K4b1/5n2/6kq w - -',My friend mikey45 asked here why white doesn't trade queens. I agree that would be the best try but black manages to stop b-pawn from promotion without losing a piece(just in time). Then it would be bishop+knight checkmate pattern.
86,1,65,Ke3,b'8/8/3b4/3q4/KP6/3nk3/2Q5/8 w - -',And white resigned showing that title players are not immortal(even against patzer like me). Black made few small inaccuracies which lost him the game: maybe trading the bishop to rook and not taking a3 pawn earlier in the game where bad choices and f3-f4-f5 push was something horribly wrong. Endgame which arose was really nice for myself to get a win out of it(feels good). Hopefully you find this game exciting aswell. I won't say it is 100% won endgame but it is clear that black is playing for win which I did!
87,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So he starts with d4
88,2,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play my usual
89,2,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Still very conventional
90,2,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',and the same from me
91,2,4,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Slightly unusual Nc3 is more common
92,2,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I develop
93,2,6,Bg2,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',So does he
94,2,7,d5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',I prevent e4. I call this the semi-grunfeld but I see the opening database calls it the King's Indian (E60) 3.g3 counterthrust variation.
95,2,8,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',so he takes
96,2,9,Nxd5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',and I take back
97,2,10,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',He develops
98,2,11,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',I castle
99,2,12,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',so does he
100,2,13,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',So now I had to start thinking for myself. This move seemed reasonable to blunt his Bg2. Afterwards I saw that Nb6 and Nc6 are more commonly played.
101,2,14,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n4/3PP3/5NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - e3',So he grabs the centre
102,2,15,Nc7,b'rnbq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/5NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I thought that this was most consistent but I found out later Nb6 is more usual
103,2,16,Nc3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So he develops
104,2,17,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I put pressure on the centre. I am threatening to take on f3 then d4
105,2,18,1Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So he protects
106,2,19,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/ppnnppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I develop
107,2,20,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/ppnnppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N1BNPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This move seems to me to be very natural but it takes us out of the opening databases (not that either of us were using them at the time of course). Qb3 is the only move on the Gameknot opening databases
108,2,21,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppnnppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/2N1BbPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I take
109,2,22,1Qxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppnnppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/2N1BQPP/PP3PB1/R4RK1 b - -',he takes back
110,2,23,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/ppnn1pbp/2p3p1/4p3/3PP3/2N1BQPP/PP3PB1/R4RK1 w - e6',I attack his centre

112,2,25,1Qf6,b'r4rk1/ppnn1pbp/2p2qp1/4p3/3PP3/2N1BQPP/PP3PB1/R2R2K1 w - -',I offer a queen exchange

114,2,27,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/ppnn1p1p/2p2bp1/4p3/3PP3/2N1B1PP/PP3PB1/R2R2K1 w - -',I take back
115,2,28,1d5,b'r4rk1/ppnn1p1p/2p2bp1/3Pp3/4P3/2N1B1PP/PP3PB1/R2R2K1 b - -',He advances. Now I thought that the best plan was to block the position up a bit as he has the 2 bishops the last thing I want is the position opening up. Shredder assesses this position as +1.41 for white.
116,2,29,1a4,b'r4rk1/ppnn1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P3/2N1B1PP/1P3PB1/R2R2K1 b - a3',so he stake a claim to space on the queen side as well as the centre. Shredder likes h4 immediately.
117,2,30,1Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/ppnn1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P3/2N1B1PP/1P3PB1/R2R2K1 w - -',Shredder likes Rfd8 too
118,2,31,1h4,b'r2r2k1/ppnn1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1B1P1/1P3PB1/R2R2K1 b - -',so he plays it now
119,2,32,1Ne8,b'r2rn1k1/pp1n1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1B1P1/1P3PB1/R2R2K1 w - -',I have a plan to blockade the passed d pawn with my knight on d6. Shredder likes this move too but still gives it as +1.59 to white.
120,2,33,1Bh3,b'r2rn1k1/pp1n1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1B1PB/1P3P2/R2R2K1 b - -',Improving the scope of his bishop and also threatening to take the knight followed by the pawn on c5. I didn't want to play b6 as then he has a5 and the chance to open the a file.
121,2,34,1Rac8,b'2rrn1k1/pp1n1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1B1PB/1P3P2/R2R2K1 w - -',So this rather curious self-pin is the best move according to Shredder
122,2,35,1f3,b'2rrn1k1/pp1n1p1p/5bp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1BPPB/1P6/R2R2K1 b - -',so he gives support to e4

I thought if d6 immediately he has Nb5 hitting my pawn on a7 and if I exchange on b5 my pawn on a7 is then under attack down the a file. Shredder actually prefers Nd6 immediately and if Nb5 then Nc4
124,2,37,2Kf2,b'2rrn1k1/pp1nbp1p/6p1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1BPPB/1P3K2/R2R4 b - -',and now he mobilises his king. I was rather afraid 20. d6 may be good for him in this position
125,2,38,2Nd6,b'2rr2k1/pp1nbp1p/3n2p1/2pPp3/P3P2P/2N1BPPB/1P3K2/R2R4 w - -',so now I play it

130,2,43,2Bg5,b'2rr2k1/1p1n1p1p/p2b2p1/2pPp1B1/P3P2P/5PPB/1P3K2/R2R4 b - -',I hadn't really looked at this. If I move my rook my knight on d7 goes so I have only one move.
131,2,44,2f6,b'2rr2k1/1p1n3p/p2b1pp1/2pPp1B1/P3P2P/5PPB/1P3K2/R2R4 w - -',which I played. Now simply Bxd7 looks good for white. I was looking at 24. Bxd7 Rxd7 25. Bxf6 h6 (threatening to trap his bishop) 26. f4 exf4 27. e5 fxg6 28. Kxg6 and although I have managed to maintain material equality his connected passed centre pawns look like winners! Interestingly Shredder doesn't like h6 and also prefers 26. g4 to 26. f4. It also prefers 25. Be3 rather than taking the pawn.
132,2,45,2Be6+,b'2rr2k1/1p1n3p/p2bBpp1/2pPp1B1/P3P2P/5PP1/1P3K2/R2R4 b - -',Nick told me after the game he only looked at Kf8 and Kh8 as replies and overlooked my simple reply.
133,2,46,2Kg7,b'2rr4/1p1n2kp/p2bBpp1/2pPp1B1/P3P2P/5PP1/1P3K2/R2R4 w - -',Shredder still gives white as being +1.18
134,2,47,b6,b'2rr4/3n2kp/pp1bBpp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/4BPP1/1P3K2/R2R4 w - -',I think it was around here I offered a draw. Shredder prefers c4 to b6

136,2,49,2Rc7,b'3r4/2rn2kp/pp1b1pp1/2pPp3/P3P2P/4BPPB/1P3K2/R2R4 w - -',So I finally break the pin. Shredder still likes c5

178,5,1,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3n4/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This is one of those moves that looks out of place for me as it moves the knight for a second time before black is developed fully and without being forced to. Having said that it is still in the gameknot database so I guess it does have some merit though quite what I am unsure.

191,5,14,Qf2,b'4rrk1/2pb1pp1/7p/p2PR3/1pQ2P2/6P1/PP1N1qBP/4R2K w - -',This was a bit of a bolt from the blue as I am not clear that black can make enough of this
192,5,15,Qxf1+,b'4rrk1/2p2pp1/7p/p2PR3/1p3P2/5NPb/PP4BP/4Rq1K w - -',being ahead on material I had no major issue with exchanging queens
193,5,16,Bxe8,b'4brk1/2p2pp1/7p/p2P4/1p3P2/5NP1/PP5P/4RB1K w - -',Surely Rxe8 is better I can only think that black wanted to avoid another rook exchange however in this position it will take a little while for the black rook to get into action. I was more interested in the black c pawn and how I might be able to make my d pawn a passer
194,5,17,2Rc1,b'4brk1/2p2pp1/7p/p2P4/1p3P2/5NP1/PP5P/2R2B1K b - -',the c pawn must fall

The combination of pieces I have remaining should be enough to ensure promotion for this pawn if needed I have Nc6 as an option if black tries to prevent promotion with his rook
196,5,19,3Bc4,b'5rk1/2R2pp1/7p/p2PNb2/1pB2P2/6P1/PP5P/7K b - -',indirectly pressures the f pawn even further. This move turns out to be important in the end of the game
197,5,20,3Bg6,b'5rk1/2R2pp1/6bp/p2PN3/1pB2P2/6P1/PP5P/7K w - -',This is surely a mistake from black as d6 pins the black pawn threatening Nxg6

207,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My preference is 1.e4 however I absolutely respect almost all other first moves.  As Black many have caused me grief.  I especially have learned to respect 1.b4 the hard way!
208,6,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A possible French or Sicilian?  Seems BOTH are at least as popular as 1...e5 though most 1.e4 players might prefer 1...e5!
209,6,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I have been scoring poorly with my Advance French lines and my Open Sicilian lines so let's go for the KIA or Closed Sicilian.  Actually I just took up the 3.d4 Sicilian stuff as White.  It has not gone well in the first few contests.  I have played the French Advance for many years and apparently Black has figured out everything.  Just comes down to the higher rated doing better....
210,6,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"French versus King's Indian Attack it is!  There's some theory. but you can almost play either side without memorizing lines or checking your chess book library.  I DO have a few King's Indian Attack books but only John Emms' ""Attacking with 1.e4"" concentrates on the French Defense move order.  As of today 10-11-2011 I think the book is still in print."
211,6,4,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The standard KIA Knight deployment. On 3.Nc3 after 3...d4 4.Nce2 we get into the land of the Dunst Opening: 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 d4 3.Nce2 with two extra pawn moves added.  After 4...e5 it is a standard Dunst position.
212,6,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Interesting.  I have not used the KIA much until recently so every game offers a new vision of the opening.  My opponent is a reasonably strong player rated around 1800.  Statisitics say he is better than me so I am respecting 3...Bd6.  I assume he might like to enforce an ...e6-e5 advance soon.  Or perhaps he is planning ...f7...f5!?  Or a Semi-Slav pawn structure (French meets Caro...yuck...too solid!).
213,6,6,Qe2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Initially (short range) this is indirect pressure on the d5 pawn mainly.  Without additional protection 5.exd5 might create issues.  Nevertheless this is unlikely and long term I am strengthening e4 and committing to putting my Bishop on g2 or h3 since the Queen currently blocks the King's Bishop. 
214,6,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Now 5.exd5 can also met with 5...Nd4.  Does not seem all that good but it is pesky.  My guess is this would be a gambit of sorts.  I do not want to fall far behind in developing pieces as my King will need four moves to castle short and three to go long.  I do not want to go long on the castle because there is not much defensive or offensive firepower for my use on my Queen side at present.
215,6,8,Ngf3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/4P3/3P1N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Let's stop the ...Nd4 threat and develope another piece!
216,6,9,dxe4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/4p3/3P1N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Black releases some central tension...
217,6,10,dxe4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Can I get in 7.e5?
218,6,11,e5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',A Double King Pawn Opening type position has arisen on the board.  In my limited chess experience French players seem to rarely play an early ....e6-e5.  Viva la difference.  Je parle francais en pus en pus.  That is something to the effect of I speak a little (very little) French!  Don't fuss at me if it translate poorly.  That is exactly the point! 
219,6,12,Nc4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/2N1P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Well...I have to move the Knight to develop the Bishop unless I fianchetto.  So maybe I get the Bishop pair in an open position?  The Bishop is tied to the defense of e5.  I get a free pawn to munch if he moves the Bishop.  Now the open position is another story.
220,6,13,Nxd6+,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nNb3/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Yep!  Bishop pair come to me.
221,6,14,cxd6,b'r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',And maybe a backward pawn on an open file to pile on.  If I were my opponent I would strongly consider an immediate ...d6-d5 advance.
222,6,15,c3,b'r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',What's the word...prophylaxis? In other words keeping the Knight or any other Black piece off d4 for now.  Remember chess is dynamic.  May need to later advance the c3 pawn to stiffen the defense of another square later.
223,6,16,Nge7,b'r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',This formation is similar to Black's Sveshnikov Sicilian formations and strongly suggests that ...f7-f5 now or in the near future is a good freeing move but I still like ...d6-d5.  Perhaps a daring soul would play both pawn breaks? Which first I wonder?
224,6,17,1Be3,b'r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',10.Bg5 just runs into 10...f6 or 10...h6.  I would just as soon keep the Black Queen off b6 instead.  
225,6,18,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Yes... I know the Knight is usually not on e7 in the Sveshnikov.  It is better here on e7 as it helps facilitate either pawn break.
226,6,19,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Planning to attack on h7 if possible and clearing the diagonal for the Bishop.  The King's Bishop's first future square is undecided at present but I do not seem to have enough time to fianchetto now.
227,6,20,1f5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4pp2/4P3/2P1BN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ f6',"Since White can threaten h7 quickly after 11...d5 12.exd5 Nxd5 13.Ng5 perhaps now the f5 break is ""safer""? "
228,6,21,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4pp2/4P3/2PBBN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',In light of his next move maybe 12.exf4 is better and then 13.Bd3 follows IF he does not recapture with is Bishop.  Actually I prefer the game move.
229,6,22,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4p3/4Pp2/2PBBN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Geez...what a spoiler!  Good move!  Seals off my short term attacking prospects on the King side.  The exchange 12...fxe4 seems to benefit White more than Black.  I'm still behind in development and must now move the Bishop too...
230,6,23,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4p3/4Pp2/2PB1N2/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',It's always a cool move to put x-rays on the higher valued piece.  Why is it an x-ray?  Well...this is not direct pressure.  And if White is not paying attention the threat is invisible just like radiation.  Later the effect can be fatal however....
231,6,24,1Qd1,b'2rq1rk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4p3/4Pp2/2PB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I did notice.... Black also had the threat of ...Nb4 against the Queen Bishop and with the Bishop's help on e6 the a2 pawn. I am beginning to suspect that the d-pawn is going to stay on d6 however. If I can only get developed that pawn sure looks tasty!
232,6,25,1Qe8,b'2r1qrk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4p3/4Pp2/2PB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black Queen to the King side?  Could be trouble.
233,6,26,1Ng5,b'2r1qrk1/pp2n1pp/2npb3/4p1N1/4Pp2/2PB4/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',This takes h5 back and threatens the unprotected Bishop.  Castling seems nice but then Black will develope an initiative on the Kingside.  So...presently no time for classical chess principles!
234,6,27,1Ng6,b'2r1qrk1/pp4pp/2npb1n1/4p1N1/4Pp2/2PB4/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Defends e6.  Also possible were 15...Qg6 or 15...Bd7.
235,6,28,1Qh5,b'2r1qrk1/pp4pp/2npb1n1/4p1NQ/4Pp2/2PB4/PP1B1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This is why I preferred 15...Qg6 as a defensive resource.  As 15.Ng5 took h5 from Black the move 15...Qg6 keeps the White Queen from immediately occupying h5. Of course after 15...Qg6 16.Nxe6 Qxe6 17.Qh5 is possible but lacking the Knight the White Queen has no teeth in her bite. Presently mate in one is threatened. To think all I wanted to do was castle.... 
236,6,29,1h6,b'2r1qrk1/pp4p1/2npb1np/4p1NQ/4Pp2/2PB4/PP1B1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Simple chess fixes the threat.
237,6,30,Kh8,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/2npq1np/4p2Q/4Pp2/2PB4/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Neither side seems to have much of an edge.  Of course the mate in one threat was easy to see and parry with 16...h6. I need to open the position for my Bishops and put my Rooks on good squares in the short term.  I probably need to retreat my Queen at least to e2 but then Black gets a free reign on the King side.  For Black maybe the long avoided ...d6-d5 is good now?   Well...I think it is.
238,6,31,1b3,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/2npq1np/4p2Q/4Pp2/1PPB4/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Trying to stop ...d6-d5 next move...
239,6,32,1Nce7,b'2r2r1k/pp2n1p1/3pq1np/4p2Q/4Pp2/1PPB4/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Seems to be preparing ...d6-d5.  Had I moved my Queen back to e2 he would not have needed to make any preparations for the pawn advance.
240,6,33,2c4,b'2r2r1k/pp2n1p1/3pq1np/4p2Q/2P1Pp2/1P1B4/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So I stop the last chance to play ...d6-d5 just as it seems he may finally see the plus side.  That move had been available since Black's 9th.  In other words this is the first chance I have had to stop the advance and make the backward pawn something of a problem forever....  I would still call the position equal as neither sides pieces have much scope.
241,6,34,2Nc6,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/2npq1np/4p2Q/2P1Pp2/1P1B4/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Of course as mentioned earlier when the c-pawn advances another hole is created on d4.  Such is the give and take of chess moves.  The idea is to get more than you give with each move!
242,6,35,2Bc3,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/2npq1np/4p2Q/2P1Pp2/1PBB4/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I am willing to cede d4 to a pawn but not to a Knight.
243,6,36,2Nce7,b'2r2r1k/pp2n1p1/3pq1np/4p2Q/2P1Pp2/1PBB4/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He opts out of 21...Nd4 once the Bishop arrives to threaten 22.Bxd4.  Of course after ...exd4 he would have e5 for his other Knight and my Bishop would be both threatened and semi-useless too.  He also would thereby eliminate the Bishop pair as a long term plus for me. Alternatively he might try 22...b5?!? but this might end up favoring me. I could see the possibility of ...d6-d5 being revived in one line (23.Rac1 bxc4 24.Bxc4 d5 25.exd5 Nxd5) but he will need to first defend the g6 Knight somehow and 22...Kh7 planning 23...b4 is dangerous due to the Bishop being on the same diagonal. Of course playing 22...b5 does not require 25...d5 as a follow up move. There's a lot going on in this seemingly quiet position.

The subsequent weaknesses probably cause the final result.  I'd probably redeploy the Knight via g8 and f6 when White's Queen is under threats and other than the backward pawn Black will be doing well.
246,6,39,Nxd5,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/4q1np/3np2Q/2P2p2/1PBB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 w - -',I missed this.  Or rather I did not consider the move because the tactic seems flawed. This move is definitely costly to Black's cause.

Those brave little pawns!  And remember John Nunn's famous LPDO mnemic device (Loose Pieces Drop Off).  Fortunately the piece is not really loose.  Maybe this is what my opponent missed when he started the faulty combination beginning with 22...d5?  All I can say is ""Been there and done that many times while playing correspondence chess."""
248,6,41,2Qxg6,b'2r2r1k/pp4p1/6Qp/3qp3/5p2/1PBB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b - -',Mate threat restored since Black opened the position for me. My opponent resigned here as he is down a lot of material after the unfortunate combination but he could have played on for some time after 25...Qg8.  White's options then include 26.Bc4 and 26.Bxe5.  Black might try 26...Rc6 after the latter.  Alternatively 25...Qc5+ renews the threat to win the c3 Bishop but after 26.Kh1 Black can not stop the mate in one.  Basically averting mate will leave a lost ending of pawns against pawns and two Bishops.  An interesting game.  White was never really better.  Black made a mistake late and White was opportunistic however.

My preferred way to play against the Alkhine I have never tried the four pawn attack and instead play the exchange variation which is a little less ambitios but good none the less. I am actually going for a specific sub variation the one I call the weird v variation.

I dont think this was a very good move from blacks perspective it blocks the d7 square for the LSB so that white can now trade it off. I think as white my position is alright.

430,12,26,1Bxd6,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2bBp1q1/3p4/1n6/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',This fork wasn't feared due to the previously mentioned line. 
431,12,27,1d4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2bBp1q1/8/1n1p4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',As planned. 
432,12,28,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2bBp1q1/8/1n1pN3/8/PPP1QPPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',The knight is able to avoid its own threat whilst interposing the threat of mate at g2 but it isn't enough to save it. 
433,12,29,1f5,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/2bBp1q1/5p2/1n1pN3/8/PPP1QPPP/2R1R1K1 w - f6',THe knight is pinned to its fate. 
434,12,30,2fxe4,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/2bBp1q1/8/1n1pP3/8/PPP1Q1PP/2R1R1K1 b - -',White doesn't take advantage of the fork yet and for good reason. If instead BxN or BxR then exf3 and the pawn is going to be a real problem for White. This is a safer option and of corse the fork is still there. 
435,12,31,2Nxa2,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/2bBp1q1/8/3pP3/8/nPP1Q1PP/2R1R1K1 w - -',Getting some compensation for the knight. By attacking the White rook White must either exchange rooks  equally or spend time trapping the Black knight allowing the Black rook to escape. 
436,12,32,2Rca1,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/2bBp1q1/8/3pP3/8/nPP1Q1PP/R3R1K1 b - -',The better option. 
437,12,33,2Rf6,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2bBprq1/8/3pP3/8/nPP1Q1PP/R3R1K1 w - -',Here I considered both Rf7 and Rf6. After considering it quite considerably I decided on Rf7. I then proceeded to move my rook to the wrong square...
438,12,34,2Rxa2,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2bBprq1/8/3pP3/8/RPP1Q1PP/4R1K1 b - -',White seems to have emerged from the worst of the attack relatively unscathed. Black does still hold the edge however. 
439,12,35,2Rf7,b'r5k1/pp3rpp/2bBp1q1/8/3pP3/8/RPP1Q1PP/4R1K1 w - -',Putting the rook where it was supposed to go on the last move... Avoiding Be5 of course. 
440,12,36,2b4,b'r5k1/pp3rpp/2bBp1q1/8/1P1pP3/8/R1P1Q1PP/4R1K1 b - b3',I think this move may have been to prevent a6 followed by Bb5 for black.

442,12,38,2Qd3,b'r5k1/p4rpp/2bBp1q1/1p6/1P1pP3/3Q4/R1P3PP/4R1K1 b - -',Threatening to chew up a pawn.

444,12,40,2Bg3,b'3r2k1/p4rpp/2b1p1q1/1p6/1P1pP3/3Q2B1/R1P3PP/4R1K1 b - -',Interrupting the Black queen's view of g2.

Although this leaves d4 hanging this enables Black's bishop to safely take on e4 - If the White queen takes on d4 then she neglects her defence of f1 meaning the e1 rook is powerless to leave the back rank to capture on e4 or else Rf1# 
446,12,42,Bxe4,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p1q1/1p6/1P1Qb3/6B1/R1P3PP/4R1K1 w - -',This also threatens c2 pins the white bishop and threatens Rf2. 
447,12,43,2c3,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p1q1/1p6/1P1Qb3/2P3B1/R5PP/4R1K1 b - -',This protects c2 but more importantly it allows the rook to keep a defensive eye on g2. 
448,12,44,2Qf5,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p3/1p3q2/1P1Qb3/2P3B1/R5PP/4R1K1 w - -',Piling up on the the f file threatening mate at f1. Bc2 was another option here to refresh the threat of Rf2.
449,12,45,2h3,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p3/1p3q2/1P1Qb3/2P3BP/R5P1/4R1K1 b - -',Giving the king some breathing space.
450,12,46,2Qg6,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p1q1/1p6/1P1Qb3/2P3BP/R5P1/4R1K1 w - -',But leaving the bishop pinned and undefended.
451,12,47,Qxg3,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p3/1p6/1P1Qb3/2P3qP/4R1P1/4R1K1 w - -',Perhaps it wasn't best to exchange - I just couldn't see anything better. 
452,12,48,3Qxe4,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4p3/1p6/1P2Q3/2P3qP/4R1P1/4R1K1 b - -',Now it's White's turn to have all the heavies lined up. 
453,12,49,Qxb4,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4Q3/1p6/1q6/7P/4R1P1/4R1K1 w - -',Black's immediate threats seem to have been warded off again but now there are two connected passed pawns that should save the day. 
454,12,50,3Rf2,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4Q3/1p6/1q6/7P/5RP1/4R1K1 b - -',"I didn't feel that this move itsself was really threatening much. Probably in preparation for Ref1 after which White looks more dangerous. 
Black finds himself at a fork in the road - 33...Qxe1+ 34.Qxe1 Rxf2 35.Qa5 and Black will end up with 2 rooks and a passed pawn vs White's Queen. I suspect this was probably ""right"" move by Black However... "
455,12,51,3Qc5,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4Q3/1pq5/8/7P/5RP1/4R1K1 w - -',... I couldn't see how to win the endgame. This move pins the White rook at f2 and forces White to defend it. The strategy at this point was to create an impenetrable fortress for the King and then set about marching the pawns down the board. 
456,12,52,3Ree2,b'5rk1/p4rpp/4Q3/1pq5/8/7P/4RRP1/6K1 b - -',I'm not sure if this is better than Ref1 or not. Ref1 doesn't immediately create any real threat whilst the f2 Rook is pinned. But this does leave the option for Black to play Qc1+ at some point to reposition the queen at some point. Qc1 isn't doesn't seem to be useful just now though. 
457,12,53,3a5,b'5rk1/5rpp/4Q3/ppq5/8/7P/4RRP1/6K1 w - a6',It doesn't seem that White can break through so Black starts pushing. 
458,12,54,3Kh2,b'5rk1/5rpp/4Q3/ppq5/8/7P/4RRPK/8 b - -',Breaking the pin.
459,12,55,3a4,b'5rk1/5rpp/4Q3/1pq5/p7/7P/4RRPK/8 w - -',It seemed that White can only swap off pieces here which seems just fine for Black with two connected passed pawns charging towards the end of the board. 
460,12,56,Rxf7,b'6k1/5rpp/4Q3/1pq5/p7/7P/4R1PK/8 w - -',One set of rook off the board. 
461,12,57,Qf8,b'4Qqk1/5rpp/8/1p6/p7/7P/4R1PK/8 w - -',The fortress remains and White will have to exchange more pieces to be able to cause Black any real trouble. The other option of course was 37...Rf8 38.Qe6+ Kh8 but it seemed like Black would need to be careful. 
462,12,58,3Qe6,b'5qk1/5rpp/4Q3/1p6/p7/7P/4R1PK/8 b - -',Pinned again. 
463,12,59,3Qe7,b'6k1/4qrpp/4Q3/1p6/p7/7P/4R1PK/8 w - -',Unfortunately this happened. Nothing more than a simple miscalculation.

478,13,13,3c4,b'8/1p2k1p1/p6p/3Pp3/1PP5/8/P1K3PP/8 b - -',Now the wall of Pawns prevents Black's K from approaching on the Q-side.

As you sighted players can see clear enough I for one most times stumble and fumble my way around the chess board like a blind man seeking his cane! This game given as an example of my style or lack of style as I bump along with only a feel to the ending. I gave up material kinda sacrificed the queen and ended the game with not much material gain but as for positional! well... see for yourself!!

The advancement of the pawn on the King's file frees the dark bishop's development and threatens to undermine Black's centre play.  Black cannot afford to allow the pawn to progress to e6; with a knight at d7 this square is a definite option to clear the knight away from the bishop's path so will have to exchange his own pawn at d5 during the skirmish.  I was anticipating pe5 as a counter attack although with my dark bishop free to pin the knight at f6 calculated this to be manageable.
560,17,1,dxe4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/8/2PPp3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move only assists white.  The following exchanges give white the advantage in development while black is forced to exchange his (developed) dark bishop for white's undeveloped bishop.  Moreover white is left with a better centre with pawns at c4 and d4 in comparison to black's at c6 and e6.

White can now focus on bringing his rooks into play while for black the knight at d7 is unhelpful and the bishop is yet to get into the game.  For black the bishop and the QRook never get into the game.  From white's point of view black is now playing with two fewer pieces and white's superior forces begin to tell.  
562,17,3,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2p5/2PPB3/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is not a good move.  White's bishop is in the dead centre of the board attacking all sides while black's sits at home.  In a better move black could regain some tempo in development with ktf6 which would in addition supply the knight to contest for control in the centre of the board and help defend the king.  As it stands however black's king's side is undefended while white has bishop knight and queen all poised to attack black's king with space in which the rooks can develop.  After move 12 black is in trouble.

Furthermore white is now beginning to amass forces against black's king once more.

The other issue is that after the ill timed pawn push black will have to add over extended pawns to his list of negatives.  The idea behind the 3. ...Nf6 plan is that black tolerates the pressure on c6 in order to defend e5 with a quick d6

577,18,5,Ba4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/B2nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -', There are two schools of thought on where to retreat the bishop?. One is that the Bishop is stronger on the b3-f7 diagonal where it can hit at black's critical weak spot. The draw back however is that black can gain space at the expense of bishops retreat. Black can also force the exchange for the bishop after the retreat. The second school of thought is to retreat to d3 or e2. This idea is more positional in nature because for the time being the bishop will suffer with limited mobility. On the upside black can not force the exchange meaning that white can keep his bishop if he wants to.

701,24,6,1Qd2,b'1r1qr1k1/2p2p2/p1pb1npp/8/2PP1P2/4PP2/PB1Q3P/RN3RK1 b - -',I feel like that queen's overworked. I'm worried about him playing Bxf4.

The doubled pawns seem a little useful to protect some squares. What I like less is a backward pawn on e3 that I can't move forward and is real easy for him to attack.
703,24,8,2Nd5,b'1r1r2k1/2p2p2/p5pp/3N3n/1bP2P2/4PP2/P6P/R1B2RK1 b - -',I've got to find a way to get that bishop into the game.

706,24,11,2Nb4,b'1r1r1bk1/5p2/p1p3pp/7n/1NP2P2/P3PP2/7P/R1B2RK1 b - -',At this point my pieces and pawns are in such a mess I'm hoping he'll trade the bishop for the knight and win back his pawn. Then the question is whose remaining minor piece is worse off. Back when I was up a pawn in this game I was content to let the other game be a draw. But now even though I'm materially up he's ahead in just about every other aspect of the game.
707,24,12,3Ke2,b'3r2k1/5pb1/2p3pp/p6n/2P2P2/Pr2PP2/R1N1K2P/2B2R2 b - -',I don't think he can break through. If I can get my rook over to d1 I'll feel ahead. He probably plays Re8 to threaten Nxf4 with my pawn pinned. So I'd have to go back to f2 and he can  move the rook back to d8 ... and a draw. But I won the other game in the match and my teammate split his games so all I need in this game is a draw for us to win the match.
708,24,13,3Kf2,b'4r1k1/5pb1/2p3pp/p6n/2P2P2/Pr2PP2/R1N2K1P/2B2R2 b - -',I offered a draw but he didn't accept it. I want to get my rook to d1 and chase his rook off of that file so I need my king on e2 to do that. But when he moves his rook to e8 I have to go back to f2 because my pawn on e3 is pinned and his knight threatens to get back into the game with Nxf4.
709,24,14,3Ke2,b'3r2k1/5pb1/2p3pp/p6n/2P2P2/Pr2PP2/R1N1K2P/2B2R2 b - -',Very odd that he timed out when he knew that I was willing to  take a draw. But I feel my rating's about 200 points higher than it should be just because of all of the people that time out against me -- and I've never timed out of a game.

982,32,16,1Qd3,b'B1b2k2/n2p1ppp/1p6/p3b3/Q7/2PqP1P1/3P3P/RN2K2R w KQ -',A trade is obviously not a good idea in this situation and Qa6 leaves my Queen too confined Qd3 moves my Queen back on to a move open field.
983,32,17,1Be4,b'2b2k2/n2p1ppp/1p6/p3b3/Q3B3/2PqP1P1/3P3P/RN2K2R b KQ -',A continued assault on the Queen that allows him to grab the h7 pawn.
984,32,18,2Qxe4,b'5k2/n2p1pp1/1p1q4/p3b3/4Q3/2P1P1P1/3P3P/RN2K2R b KQ -',With his Bishop finally off of the longest white diagonal I decide to attack his h1 Rook.  He moves his Bishop back to e4 and we swap.
985,32,19,Ne7,b'5k2/3pnpp1/1p1q1b2/p7/3PQ3/2P1P1P1/7P/RN2KR2 w Q -',Since he now has control of the middle I need to to try and consolidate my position.  Eventually I plan to move the Knight to take out either the c3 or e3 pawn to greatly weaken his extended pawn line.
986,32,20,Qb8,b'1q3k2/3pnpp1/1p3b2/p7/3PQ3/N1P1P1P1/7P/R3KR2 w Q -',I cannot move my Queen into a proper position to counter Nb3 as an attack on the d6 square so I have to retreat it.
987,32,21,d5,b'1q3k2/4npp1/1p3b2/p2p4/2NPQ3/2P1P1P1/7P/R3KR2 w Q d6',His mistake of Nc4 allows for the pawn fork of his Queen and Knight and gives me a more open position where I only need to worry about linear movement.
988,32,22,Kg8,b'6k1/4npp1/1p1q1b2/p7/2QP4/2P1P1P1/7P/1R2KR2 w - -',With my King on f8 pinned behind my two pawns and Knight I need to allow for an escape to h7 to prevent a simple backline checkmate.
989,32,23,3Kd2,b'6k1/4npp1/Qp2qb2/p7/3P4/2P1P1P1/3K3P/1R3R2 b - -',With his Queen now very limited in range of movement since it is behind both my a5 and b6 pawns I can start attacking beginning with the e3 pawn which he defends with Kd2.
990,32,24,3Qc4,b'6k1/5pp1/1p2qb2/p2n4/2QP4/2P1P1P1/3K3P/1R3R2 b - -',He defends with Qc4 to pin my Knight to my Queen which would make a fork of Ne3 a bad idea costing me a Queen and Knight to his Queen.  However Qd3 would've been a much better move as now his King is very vulnerable to Qxe3 and so forth.  Eventually it's this move that really ends up costing him.  While I would've responded to Qd3 with ... Bg5 putting further pressure on the e3 pawn he could still be in a position to defend the crucial e3 pawn with one of his rooks.
991,32,25,3Qxe3+,b'6k1/5pp1/1p3b2/p2n4/2QP4/2P1q1P1/3K3P/1R3R2 w - -',So I begin my attack.
992,32,26,3Kc2,b'6k1/5pp1/1p3b2/p2n4/2QP4/2P1q1P1/2K4P/1R3R2 b - -',"Note that Kd1 would result in a trade of his Queen for my Knight with the following:

33. Kd1 Nxc3+
34. Qxc3 Qxc3"
993,32,27,Ne3,b'6k1/5pp1/1p3b2/p7/2QPq3/1KP1n1P1/7P/1R3R2 w - -',Now I fork his Queen and Rook with the move I had already prepared two moves ago.
994,32,28,3Rfe1,b'2Q5/5ppk/1p3b2/p7/3Pq3/1KP1n1P1/7P/1R2R3 b - -',He saves both his Queen and Rook by attacking my King forcing it to h7 but then makes the mistake of trying to save his rook by pinning my Knight to my Queen.  This mistake will eventually cost him his Queen and one Rook to my Bishop and my Knight when I place his King into check with three consecutive moves.  A better move would have been Rc1 to defend against Qc2+ even though it trades his Rook on f1 for my Knight.  Rf2 would also defend the c2 square but allow for me to play ... Qxb1+ taking his Rook without trading my Knight as well as continue attacking his King.
995,32,29,3Qc2+,b'2Q5/5ppk/1p3b2/p7/3P4/1KP1n1P1/2q4P/1R2R3 w - -',The first check forces his King to move to a3.
996,32,30,Be7+,b'2Q5/4bppk/1p6/p7/3P4/K1P1n1P1/2q4P/1R2R3 w - -',"This second check forces him to block the check with either his Queen or his Rook.  If he blocks with his Queen I can take it off with bxc6 and then if he takes my Knight with his Rook on e1 I can use cxd4+ to put his King in check again with my Bishop and force mate in a few different varations but nonetheless force Rb4 dxe3 taking his Rook on e3 and leaving the other one pinned to his King continuing on in something like mate in 5 as follows:

41. g4 Qxc3+ 
42. Ka2 Bxb4 (this move takes off his second rook)
43. g5 Ba3
44. g6+ fxg6 or g6+ Kxg6
45. Kb1 Qb2#"
997,32,31,3Rb4,b'2Q5/4bppk/1p6/p7/1R1P4/K1P1n1P1/2q4P/4R3 b - -',So instead of blocking with his Queen he makes the smarter move of blocking with his rook.
998,32,32,3Bxb4+,b'2Q5/5ppk/1p6/p7/1b1P4/K1P1n1P1/2q4P/4R3 w - -',And the third check.  This forces cxb4 and results in Qxc8.
999,32,33,4Rxe3,b'2q5/5ppk/1p6/p7/1P1P4/K3R1P1/7P/8 b - -',So after Rxe3 the exchange is complete he will be down to just the Rook and pawns versus my Queen and pawns.
1000,32,34,Qc2,b'8/5ppk/1p6/8/1K1P4/4R1P1/2q4P/8 w - -',Now I start to begin setting up forks with my Queen trying to capture his Rook.
1001,32,35,4d5,b'8/5ppk/1p6/3P4/1K6/4R1P1/2q4P/8 b - -',This is a questionable move allowing me to fork his King Rook and d5 pawn by playing ... Qd2+.
1002,32,36,4Rc3,b'8/5ppk/1p6/3P4/1K6/2R3P1/3q3P/8 b - -',He effectively protects his Rook but his d5 pawn is now gone and this game is virtually over.
1003,32,37,4Rc3,b'8/5ppk/1p6/8/1K6/2R3P1/3q3P/8 b - -',By playing Rc3 instead of something like Kb5 he allows me to take off his h2 pawn and still be able to get back to protect my pawn on b6.
1004,32,38,4Rc4,b'8/5ppk/1p6/1K6/2Rq2P1/8/8/8 b - -',A good move here as he protects his g4 pawn and Rook at the same time after the move of ... Qd4.  However I might not have taken off the g4 pawn in exchange for my pawn at b6 since his pawn isn't really a threat and I would rather keep three pawns on the board instead of just two.
1005,32,39,4g5,b'8/5ppk/1p1q4/1K4P1/2R5/8/8/8 b - -',Not a very good move here.  I can go Qd5+ and take his pawn with no consequence.
1006,32,40,4Qd5+,b'8/5ppk/1p6/1K1q2P1/2R5/8/8/8 w - -',"If he responds here with anything other than Kb4 he loses his Rook.  He has four other moves to make.

1. Rc5 would result in Qxc5+
2. Ka4 would result in Qxc4+
3. Kxb6 would result in Qxc4
4. Ka6 would result in Qxc4

Note that Kb4 being the only move that protects his Rook also prevents him from taking my pawn on b6 when I play ... Qxg5.  I could also have played this move one turn earlier although his pawn would not have been on g5."
1007,32,41,5Rc6,b'8/5ppk/1pR5/6q1/1K6/8/8/8 b - -',I can still protect my pawn while keeping my Queen with one of three moves.  Qe3 and Qe8 can accomplish this...
1008,32,42,5Qa5+,b'8/5ppk/1pR5/q7/1K6/8/8/8 w - -',... but Qa5+ is much better
1009,32,43,f5,b'8/6pk/1pR5/q4p2/2K5/8/8/8 w - f6',I could've gone Qc5+ here and forced a trade that would've eliminated his rook.  However his King was close enough that I couldn't just automatically move my pawn on g7 all the way down for a Queen.  Therefore there was no reason to trade my Queen just to eliminate his last power piece.
1010,32,44,b5,b'8/6pk/3q4/1p3p2/2R5/2K5/8/8 w - -',Continuing to slowly move pawns forward into position while keeping them in a position that I can defend both at the same time with my Queen.

1012,32,46,5Rxb5,b'8/7k/2q5/1R3pp1/8/1K6/8/8 b - -',Most likely a resignation move here.
1013,32,47,f4,b'8/7k/8/1q4p1/5p2/2K5/8/8 w - -',Since his King was close enough to catch either pawn before they reached the end line I decided to just start moving my f column pawn and then protect it with my Queen or eventually move the g column pawn if necessary.
1014,32,48,Qe2#,b'8/7k/8/6p1/8/5p2/4q3/4K3 w - -',It wasn't.
