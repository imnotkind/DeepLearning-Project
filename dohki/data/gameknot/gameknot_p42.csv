0,0,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not surprised with this move as I've seen before.  Personally I would've played the Siclian but where she is I'm not surprised at Mary's decision to play 2...Nf6  What I had anticipated however was 2...Nc6 in which case I'd respond with the Ruy Lopez.
1,0,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Instead of exchanging on e4 and e5 I play this.  The idea being as ION pointed out is that 3.Nxe5 Nxe4 would lose tempo for white which is something that I wasn't going to allow.
2,0,2,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I anticipated 3...Nc6 but I'm not surprised with this move as she has played the Philidor against me as noted in our last training session.
3,0,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',Of course I know how to respond to that.
4,0,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now she plays what I mentioned.
5,0,5,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Therefore I treat it like the Ruy Lopez because this is what I'm most accustomed to.
6,0,6,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?! I anticipated this but I call it an inaccuracy.  I kept this in mind and realized that if I force can exchange which is going to happen her Q is not on the white square.  Therefore Mary winds up with doubled pawns.  Doing this will put her at a small disadavantage early.  That's because in general doubled pawns are something you don't want unless it's a passer you're ahead or you win a B pair etc.  But otherwise they're known to cause damage.
7,0,7,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1pp1n2/4p1B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Instead of castling right away I decide to take advantage by pinning her other N.  In fact I said pins are very nasty.  But unlike before there is a small problem which we'll see on her next move.  Having said that best was 7.0-0 getting my K to safety at once.
8,0,8,Bh4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2pp1/p1pp1n1p/4p3/3PP2B/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This is a move that I calculated.  Now I predicted that this would happen.  I also took into consideration 8...g5 9.Bg3 and asked myself if this loses anything.  When calculating lines I didn't think so since my B is not locked on g3.  That's true but this is where I miscalculate because after that black gets a nasty attack on my N with 9...g4  Having said that although it didn't appear that was a mistake on my part as it should cost white a pawn.
9,0,9,1Nd2,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/p1pp1n1p/4p3/3PP1p1/2N3B1/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This time it's crammed and the reason this should lose a pawn is that the move played also blocks in my Q so that should she find the right move I can't recapture.  I looked at and had considered 10.Nh4?? asking myself if it's good.  After further consideration I realized that this is a terrible blunder because after 10...Nh7 or 10...Nd7 my N isn't only attacked but there are no escapes.  So no matter where I'll go she'll win a piece which is something that I couldn't allow espeically since I'm coaching her.
10,0,10,1h5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/p1pp1n2/4p2p/3PP1p1/2N3B1/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I told Mary that best was 10...exd4! winning my d pawn.
11,0,11,1Nb3,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/p1pp1n2/4p2p/3PP1p1/1NN3B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',But since she missed that opportunity I wasn't going to give her another chance to take.  So I was instead going to protect it and now the N is in a better position.
12,0,12,1a5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/2pp1n2/p3p2p/3PP1p1/1NN3B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',She wants to win my N.
13,0,13,1dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/2pp1n2/p3P2p/4P1p1/1NN3B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"The real reason behind this move was to win a pawn or take away castling rights.  The idea being was that if 12...dxe5?! 13.Qxd8+ Kxd8 and while material level is even I'd have a slight advantage since black would lose castling rights.  In fact Mary knew this plan and asked ""Joe you like to play without Queens?""  The only reason I didn't answer her was that if I said yes she know the plan and it'd help her find the best move which as I learned with students you don't want to give them the benefit of the doubt."
14,0,14,1a4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/2pp1n2/4P2p/p3P1p1/1NN3B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',However Mary sees what I'm really up to and goes for my N.  That's of no big deal for when she takes I take back and things are still even.
15,0,15,1cxb3,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p2/2pp1P2/7p/4P1p1/1PN3B1/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I had a very tough time deciding between this capture or 14.axb3  The reason I played this was because I thought I was protecting e4 thus remaining a pawn ahead.  The idea being is that I had anticipated 14...Ra5 followed by 15...Re5  Now I also looked my over DSB as he couldn't go there.  But if she could now if 14...Ra5 15.Qe7 so that if 15...Re5 she can't take.  But what I overlooked  is that she will win back my pawn on f6.  However everything is still even and has become quite interesting.
16,0,16,1O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/2p2p2/2pp1q2/7p/4P1p1/1PN3B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"?? Ok do you remember what C++ said in his last annotation?  ""11. O-O?? would be a bad mistake. If your Gameknot rating is below 1500 try to figure out why 11. O-O would be a blunder.""  So I accurately commented by saying Yes. In my case that's especially important since I've gone wrong by trying to caste prematurely. In this case white would wind up with an exposed K should he castle. So if 11.0-0 11...Bxh2+ 12.Kxh2 Ng4+ 13.Kg3 g5 14.Bxg5 hxg5  Only to find out that I got the correct because on the next move he said ""If 11. O-O? then 11...Bxh2+! 12. Kxh2 Ng4+ followed by ...Qxh4. This knight often comes into c4 after white plays b4.""  Well I just made the same blunder.  As it turns out this move should lose a piece with best play.  I'm very that I made this flaw against someone that I'm training.  The idea is that you don't show lienency and make errors like this as it's quite bad for learning purposes.  In this case unusual circumstances call for unusual measure so best was 15.h4 gxh3 e.p 16.gxh3 Bxh3 and while I don't like losing a pawn or having my K wide open and exposed it's better then hanging a piece like this."
17,0,17,1e5,b'r1b1kb1r/2p2p2/2pp1q2/4P3/6pp/1PN3B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Knowing that I'm already trying to figure a way out of this.  The one thing that I kept in mind was GM games.  Now I always thought that when someone attacks a piece they're opponent reattacks but just for the sake of gaining of tempo.  And there were a lot of variations that mentioned it which I played through.  However I now know why this happens.  The reason why after one attacks the opponent reattacks is although it appears so there is no escape square.  So if you didn't go after something more valuable that player would lose a piece and there'd be no way out of it.  Having learned that and now making the connection I'm going to reattack but it will be after her Q.  In fact I told her something based on what Jack has emphasized repeadetly until it became second nature which I eventually told my students.  That is you have to find a way out of trouble and she agreed by nodding her head.
18,0,18,1dxe5,b'r1b1kb1r/2p2p2/2p2q2/4p3/6pp/1PN3B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',As anticipated.
19,0,19,1Ne4,b'r1b1kb1r/2p2p2/2p2q2/4p3/4N1pp/1P4B1/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',But since my B is under fire I will like before reattack her Q.  That's because anything else loses my DSB without compensation.
20,0,20,1Qc2,b'r1b1kb1r/2p1qp2/2p5/4p3/4N1pp/1P4B1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Now that she's defended her Q I think about what else to do in this position as my B is still hanging.  I realize that I can't reattack her Q again.  So I come up with a different.  No I don't play this just because it attacks a pawn for if that were the case she'd be able to take my B which is worth more then a pawn.  Instead I remebered what GM Damian which is that one should create a threat that's difficult to drive off.  This is one of those times for black must do something to not only protect c6 but prevent what's bound to come.  It's worth noting that for to come up with this I had to remember and visualize the kind of position that you'd see from the Domino Defense where you give up a piece to win a R.  The same thing could be said here because I'm giving something up at this point and if and when she should take there will be consequences.  But I also remembered what GM Susan Polgar said about combos that you give something away for something else worth more which will often give you the advantage.
21,0,21,1hxg3,b'r1b1kb1r/2p1qp2/2p5/4p3/4N1p1/1P4p1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',?? An outright blunder.  
22,0,22,1Qxc6+,b'r1b1kb1r/2p1qp2/2Q5/4p3/4N1p1/1P4p1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',"Mary: Poor Rooky Rook.  Joe: That's where ""To take is a mistake.""  Mary: Yeah.  Joe: Better was 18...Bb7 18...Bd7 or 18...Rh6  Best was 18...c5 in this position.  The idea behind all of that was so that I could not grab the c pawn and cause trouble.  But I made a small mistake because when I said that I forgot that 18...Bb7 was an illegal move."
23,0,23,2Qxa8,b'Q1b1kb1r/2pq1p2/8/4p3/4N1p1/1P4p1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b k -',As noted I was thinking in terms of the Domino Defense plus the idea was pinning her B because doing this sort of thing early is usually of bad omen.  But best was 20.Nf6+ winning the Q for my N due to a nasty fork.  This time I didn't simply overlook it as usual but rather miscalculated.  And that was due to my game against vesper2 which you saw in my last annotation.  In that game the Q was forked but the K was not involved so it was between Q+R and the Q could get away there.  Well I thought along a similar line but this time my N and her Q in a different diagonal so it does work.  Therefore the fork this time would be between K+Q so if I had played that move Mary would've had to lose her Q.
24,0,24,2gxh2+,b'Q1b1kb1r/2pq1p2/8/4p3/4N1p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4RK1 w k -',Not at all surprised to see her play this as Mary is doing anything for counterplay.
25,0,25,2Kh1,b'Q1b1kb1r/2pq1p2/8/4p3/4N1p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K b k -',Forced.
26,0,26,2f5,b'Q1b1kb1r/2pq4/8/4pp2/4N1p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K w k f6',?? I understand why she played this with the idea of trying to gain tempo with the threat.  This unfortunately is another blunder.    In fact I forgot to record this but I think I told her that better was 21...Bg7 21...Be7 or 21...Rh6  All of these moves protect the area.  So with this error I won't same mistake that I made before.
27,0,27,2Nf6+,b'Q1b1kb1r/2pq4/5N2/4pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K b k -',"She said ""Oh I've lost my Queen.  Oh man"""
28,0,28,Bxd7,b'Q4b1r/2pbk3/8/4pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K w - -',Now something very interesting has happened.  Mary asked me what an en-pessant capture was.  So Jack and I told her.  In fact I gave her a good example since for a long while I had trouble understanding.  Therefore the example was suppose that I played f4.  Now you'd be able to capture with ...gxf3 and since you can capture horizontally this is an en-pessant capture.  Then Jack explained it a little better that if the pawn is far enough down yet I'd advance it two squares horizontally only once can the capture be made horizontally to stop the pawn from advancing further down.  That capture is called en-pessant.
29,0,29,2Qa5,b'5b1r/2pbk3/8/Q3pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K b - -',I almost played 24.Qb7 but with that move Mary would be able to defend her c pawn after 24...c6.  This however is a fork between c7 and e5.  Therefore black must now lose a pawn one way or another.
30,0,30,2Kd6,b'5b1r/2pb4/3k4/Q3pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/R4R1K w - -',"?? With this move forget about a pawn.  Instead I remember about tactics and will use them to win another piece.  Having said that I calculate the next few moves and therefore knew how to respond.  I am not sure what the best move but what I know is as someone once said when commenting one of my annotations ""Almost anything is better then this move."""
31,0,31,2Qxd7,b'5b1r/2pQ4/1k6/4pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/3R1R1K b - -',"Mary: I have no way to protect.  Joe: True but you're still in the game.  I think that if I told her the problem with what happened she'd resigned.  That's because in the game what I implied by telling her that she's still in the game is not to resign yet.  The idea being is that it's not over til it's over.  And as Judit Polgar would say ""Fight til the end"" which is what it all boils down to.  Afterall you never really know what'll happen until the end so by staying in I feel that there's more for Mary to learn.  And it goes along with the Supplemental Talking the Talk rules that you don't resign until you see an inevitable mating sequence."
32,0,32,2Bd6,b'7r/2pQ4/1k1b4/4pp2/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/3R1R1K w - -',? I think the idea was to add another defender to the K.  But no matter where she went black would've lost another pawn.  I initially thought there was a way but that move would've been a blunder as we'll see shortly.
33,0,33,Rh5,b'8/2p5/1k1b4/4pQ1r/6p1/1P6/PP3PPp/3R1R1K w - -',"?? Blunder that I overlooked shortly.  Believe it or not Mary said ""the pawn is a goner though.""  At first I agreed with that and nodded.  But I was very wrong this time around.  With that being said best was 28...Rh4"
34,0,34,2g3,b'8/2p5/1k1b4/4pQ1r/6p1/1P4P1/PP3P1p/3R1R1K b - -',"I wouldn't have made this inaccuracy at all as there was something much worse that I could've done.  That was 29.Qxh6  First I was a little worried about the pawn taking back but I reversed the colors.  The real reason this happened is that Mary and I were suddenly put on the spot and became very distracted when Jack made a comment.  In it he asked ""You're still playing this game?""  That implied that she should resign and this is a frequent but whenever someone suddenly gets involved distractions happen soon after.  In fact I've seen plenty of examples with Jack where he gets distracted at something going on and then makes mistakes.  It's even happened against his students.  And in fact it resulted in his first lost against me.  Sure I was winning as I had already won his R but then he gave an example of why a move was a mistake.  But then he got distracted played the wrong move which enabled me to take his other R.  As a result of being down 2 R's without compensation Jack resigned.  So the idea is that when you get distracted you often move a little too quickly and therefore don't find the best move or make a mistake.  That however isn't good and something should be done the only question is what and how to deal with sudden distraction like this.  I think the best way is to pause and take a little longer before moving as per what Ken said when I made a different mistake earlier against the same opponent and forgot to grab her N as opposed to a pawn."
35,0,35,2Rh8,b'7r/2p5/1k1b4/4pQ2/6p1/1P4P1/PP3P1p/3R1R1K w - -',Mary: It sort of doesn't matter.  I realize that she's right because one way or another however I will grab that pawn.
36,0,36,Ra8,b'r7/2p5/1k1b4/4p3/6Q1/1P4P1/PP3P1p/3R1R1K w - -',Trying to grab my a pawn.
37,0,37,3a4,b'r7/2p5/1k1b4/4p3/P5Q1/1P4P1/1P3P1p/3R1R1K b - a3',Normally I wouldn't fuss about that but instead respond with 31.Kxh2 so that if she takes I take back.  But in this case I need that pawn as it is a passer.  So I have to try to avoid losing my advantages as per what was outlined in my last annotation.  I am also starting to think along the lines of what happened between charleshiggie and brigadecommander where you had a Q yet a different pawn promoted so that each side had two Q's.  Well that obviously isn't going to occur here as there won't be 4 Q's like there was in that game.  But if played right the possibility of 2 Q's exist where I'd promote yet still remain with a Q.
38,0,38,3Ra5,b'8/2p5/1k1b4/r3p3/P5Q1/1P4P1/1P3P1p/3R1R1K w - -',To prevent my a pawn from advancing further.  I wasn't going to do so right away but it wouldn't be too far away.  In fact my plan was to play 32.Rd5 and that would be followed by a5.  For now however this move stops that.
39,0,39,3Kxh2,b'8/2p5/1k1b4/r3p3/P5Q1/1P4P1/1P3P1K/3R1R2 b - -',But it does not stop me from winning another pawn.  In fact I said 31...Ra5? was a mistake because it lost a pawn.  Best was 31...Rh8
40,0,40,3Rc5,b'8/2p5/1k1b4/2r1p3/P5Q1/1P4P1/1P3P1K/3R1R2 w - -',Trying to grab my b pawn since the plan is 33...Rc2.  But by playing this I can do something quite nasty.
41,0,41,Kc6,b'8/2p5/2kb4/2r1p3/PQ6/1P4P1/1P3P1K/3R1R2 w - -',Best was 33...Ka6 to prevent my next move.
42,0,42,3a5,b'8/2p5/2kb4/P1r1p3/1Q6/1P4P1/1P3P1K/3R1R2 b - -',As now I should be able to promote with best play.
43,0,43,3Rc2,b'8/2p5/2kb4/P3p3/1Q6/1P4P1/1Pr2P1K/3R1R2 w - -',Still trying to win my c2 pawn.  However there is a discover attack which I'm bound to miss.  I thought that if she takes my c pawn I'd promote once and for all.
44,0,44,3a6,b'8/2p5/P1kb4/4p3/1Q6/1P4P1/1Pr2P1K/3R1R2 b - -',?? So in anticipation of that I continue advancing.  But this is a terrible blunder that shouldn't have been overlooked.  Either way black was going to get back a pawn and the plan behind 34.a5 was to win back my Q.  By playing this I have allowed this which cost me my advantage to a large extent.  Not only that but I could've continued advancing and promoted so with that being said best was 35.Qa5  But with this move the Q is doomed.  And now black has a possiblity of drawing or even winning the game.  That makes me upset that I subconsciously gave her back the advantage.  
45,0,45,3a7,b'8/P1p5/2k5/4p3/1b6/1P4P1/1Pr2P1K/3R1R2 b - -',"So I think about what to do.  But this is another error and black can surely now get back what she lost.  The question which has been very difficult is the when to.  In this context when do tactics apply the most since I know that 99% of chess is tactics.  I realize that it's here and as ION said in my last game against the same student it's all in my head.  In it he said ""It's all there in your head - it just needs sorting and prioritising. I would suggest you should play 'tactics first' and positional second. Most players develop that way - there is a kind of exhilaration seeing how the pieces and pawns interact to achieve certain ends or prevent the opponent achieving his aims that appeals to young players. I know it did me! Keep the position guidelines in mind of course but for the time being subordinate them to tactical and material considerations. As your strength (rating) improves then is the time to reconsider your game plan.""  Therefore best was 36.Rh1 allowing that pawn to promote because as Jack has made me do for homework and Susan Polgar have emphasized in an endgame the idea is always that a R should be behind the passed pawn.  This would've allowed a promotion.  Had I remembered all of that I would have played Rh1."
46,0,46,3Kb7,b'8/Pkp5/8/4p3/1b6/1P4P1/1Pr2P1K/3R1R2 w - -',Which should stop the pawn from promoting because even if 37.Rh1 she has 37...Bc5

48,0,48,3Rc5,b'8/Pkp5/8/2rRp3/1b6/1P4P1/1P3P1K/5R2 w - -',?? So I said a blunder that I almost missed.  I was worried that if I told her anymore I'd give her too much coaching and then she either resign now or would make a worse mistake that would allow mate.  The idea is that you can only teach so much without going overboard.  Knowing that I went overboard with vasper2 I wasn't going to do it again here so I didn't say anymore.  But best was 37...Kxa8 and even if and when 39.Rxe5 I lose the opportunity to promote and the game should end in a draw.  But with this move I won't miss the tactic that I overlooked earlier.  In other words I will play 38.Ra1 
49,0,49,Ra5,b'8/Pkp5/8/r2Rp3/1b6/1P4P1/1P3P1K/R7 w - -',Instead of taking she plays this.  Mary kept in mind that if 38...Rxd5 I'd promote right away with 39.a8=Q+  But it's too little too late.  That's because not only do I exchange R's but after that I win a piece back and no matter what black plays after that I will promote.  Therefore all hope is gone.
50,0,50,4a8=Q,b'Q7/2p5/1k6/R3p3/8/1P4P1/1P3P1K/8 b - -',"Mary said ""Yeah you've got it.  I'm done it's over.""  And she resigned.  This time I agreed with her and resignation is no longer premature.  That's because I have an inevitable mating sequence.  At first I looked at 41.Qa7+ Kc6 (forced) and I'd still mate but it'd take longer without an immediate mate.  But shortly after there is one move that forces mate which I would've played right away had she not resigned.  And there is no way out as the K can't move and in order to delay mate black would have to get out of danger with her monarch.  With that being said I would've played 42.Qa6# had she stayed in so I agreed that it was safe to resign.  I also base things on what Jack's input since he as we know is a legend due to how many students he's trained.  In it he said to Mary ""How many times must I tell you to castle?  You've got to castle.""  Then I looked at it and realized that he isn't completely correct.  The reason being is that black could not castle because her pieces blocked that from happening.  But why did this happen?  It is because black did not complete her development and payed the price.  So what I said was yes and developing your pieces is important.  For example early in the game I noticed that you were pushing pawns when the time could've been used to develop your pieces.  Jack agreed by nodding his head.  What I was implying overlyes some of what he said that in the opening it is important to develop castle and control the center.  When Mary failed to do that there were consequences.  With that being said the overall moral to this story is ""Openings must be used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the midgame will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results""  This is a perfect example because failing to open properly took it's toll which became very notiecable in the end."

54,1,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Essa é uma resposta rara que ocorre em menos de 05% das vezes em que temos 1e4e5 2Cf3. As estatísticas indicam que esse é um movimento ruim pois em cerca de 70% dos casos as brancas vencem. Observe que o cavalo poderá capturar o peão central das pretas.

56,1,5,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b1PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Melhor seria capturar o peão. Esse xeque não teve muita objetividade pois é facilmente contornado pelas brancas.
57,1,6,c3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b1PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Boa jogada: resolve o xeque libera uma diagonal para a dama atua no centro e realiza um ataque contra o bispo preto.
58,1,7,Ba5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/b3p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',As pretas movimentaram o bispo depois movimentaram outra vez e agora movimentaram de novo! Isso viola um princípio importante: na abertura do jogo evite usar a mesma peça mais de uma vez.
59,1,8,Nxe5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/b3N3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Boa jogada! As brancas ganham o peão (já deveriam ter feito isso mas antes tarde do que nunca!)
60,1,9,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/b3N3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Bom lance desenvolvendo o cavalo para a sua melhor casa liberando o caminho para o roque pequeno e atacando um peão branco.
61,1,10,f3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/b3N3/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Cc4 teria sido mais agressivo mas o lance escolhido ao menos mostra que as brancas perceberam que seu peão estava ameaçado.
62,1,11,Na6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/n4n2/b3N3/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Lance ruim: atua sobre o centro? não! Desenvolve alguma peça? Não! Posiciona o cavalo em uma casa boa? Não! (como regra geral cavalos não devem ficar nos cantos a menos que exista algum motivo específico) Cria alguma ameaça para o adversário? Não!
63,1,12,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/n4n2/bB2N3/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Ok esse lance não compromete nada grave e ainda abre espaço para o roque pequeno. Contudo se a ideia foi criar uma ameaça esqueça: o peão em d7 conta com 4 defesas! Além disso se esse bispo se tornar incômodo poderá ser facilmente expulso por meio de um avanço de peão até c6.
64,1,13,Nb8,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/bB2N3/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Péssimo lance que revela que as pretas estão um pouco confusas e sem imaginação: primeiro colocam o cavalo em uma casa ruim depois desperdiçam tempo fazendo-o retornar à casa inicial! Aqui muito melhor teria sido rocar.

66,1,15,a6,b'rnbqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p4n2/bB2N3/3PP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Ok esse lance tem um mérito: é agressivo pois coloca o bispo branco em risco. No futuro porém dêem preferência a ataques que não possam ser tão facilmente defendidos. Aqui o bispo vai recuar sem maiores dificuldades (e se for atacado novamente pelo outro peão continuará fugindo e no fim das contas estará em uma boa casa!) 0 melhor teria sido ROCAR

Em vez de fugir com o bispo ou providenciar alguma defesa as pretas deram um jeito de PREGAR o cavalo branco: se as brancas insistirem em capturar o bispo de a5 com o cavalo perderão a Dama com BxD! Contudo um pouco mais de cálculo mostra que o lance não é bom pois depois de trocar bispo por cavalo com BxC e g7xB as brancas poderiam avançar o peão até d5 anulando a pregadura - e assim o cavalo poderia capturar o bispo em segurança.

- I've almost ended my development 
- It opens a line for my rook against the black king. 
- I have more pieces on the kingside. 
- I have a center so I might easily move pieces from the quenside to the kingside. That means that my c3 knight might join throughout e4. If e6 is plyed my bihop from b3 might go to c2 and still attack something. Meantime the black knights would remain out of the stage of the events. "

203,5,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Whenever my opponent plays QP this is my response as I'm ready in case he played the QG or something similar.
204,5,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',?! This is a perfect example.  It's I believe the QID.  Now there was more game chat then what shows but that's because most of it got deleted as the game lasted over 2 months.  With what got deleted I forgot what he said but remembered what I said.  So I'm not sure but seem to remember telling him that this is a slight inaccuracy because in QP games like this the one should not bring the C N to c3  Instead better was 2.Nd7 developing the N but on a square where the c pawn is not blocked.  
205,5,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Not to protect but rather develop the right N and prepare to castle.
206,5,4,h4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P3P/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq h3',?! I have no idea why he played this but I told gus that this is an inaccuracy because it doesn't develop or help control the center.  Better was to develop his other N or DSB.
207,5,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P3P/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Not only developing and opening a central.  But the idea was also adding protection to f7.  In addition after seeing comments in another annotation I realize that I could allow my N to be pinned as I anticipated 4.Bg5  That however wasn't needed but as I recently learned from GM Susan Polgar which happened almost at the end of the game one of the main things you want to think about in the opening is a pawn chain.
208,5,6,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/1b1P3P/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',The idea is that by allowing that I was going to pin his N.  This one would be nastier because he hasn't developed or opened a space for his LSB.  In other words I am better developed which will make it very difficult to break this pin.  Doing so means that he will have to advance his wing pawn when the time should be used to develop another piece.
209,5,7,a3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/1b1P3P/P1N5/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',"I think I said something like I know why you played this.  I understand that you wanted to break the pin but more common was to retreat the DSB.  That's because by playing this I will take and in order to prevent the loss of a piece he must take back.  And when Gus does this he will wind up with doubled pawns.  Since I'm not behind and he does not have a passed pawn doubled pawns are known to be bad as this will weaken his position.  Of course I keep in mind what I've been taught which is that the whole idea is thinking about how to improve your position which I am.

210,5,8,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P3P/P1P5/2P1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Not only developing but seeing how strong my position is I improve it a little more with this.  I also could've castled but now instead of say 7.Bxf3 Qxf3 I have an extra defender.  This way if he takes my weak N will become even stronger then my N f6.  In addition Jack has accurately said that stronger players don't mind having one N out but having the other near it's homesquare.  In fact he annotated a game like that and the stronger player believe it or not benefitted from that.  So I kept that in mind and realized that this setup would benefit.  In addition my LSB is in no rush to come out.  The is that stronger players can make slight deviations from normal openings whereas the trainer should follow the guidelines.  What I just said is a lesson I learned from the easy19.

212,5,10,f4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P1P1P/P1P1P3/2P3P1/R2QKBNR b KQ f3',?! I told Gus that I understood why he played this.  White wanted to advance and was worried about the f pawn.  But I said that the pawn was not in danger and there were other things to be worried.  With that I gave it as an inaccuracy.  By doing this his DSB isn't just jammed but also trapped as it blocks off white's only retreat square for that B.  Normally it doesn't make a difference except that his B is worth more then my N on f6 and I do go by what Dan Heisman says about B pair.  Therefore not only do I win an exchange but my N on d7 as noted will become even stronger then one on e6 once we exchange.  So although point value is down to 0 it goes from slight to me having a noticeable advantage at this point. 
213,5,11,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/3P1P1P/P1P1P3/2P1Q1P1/R3KBNR b KQ -',The thing is that this move doesn't develop as the Q is out sooner then other pieces.  And since he's training it's not a good idea to deviate as noted unless you must.  But this is not one of those times.  Better was to develop his N or LSB and prepare to castle.  However I wasn't going to fault him for this move because he is still going to castle which is a good idea to do.  Come to think of it I really should've though since castling is going to be a blunder.  Yet I decided to emphasize the most important because as I've learned from ION sometimes too much coaching can also be problematic and can cause the student to make a mistake which you don't want.  So it's about finding the happy medium and knowing when to and not to give to do it.
214,5,12,1Ne4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/3PnP1P/P1P1P3/2P1Q1P1/R3KBNR w KQ -',But I knew the plan and played as now it is no longer safe to castle.  Instead there is a much bigger to look at.
215,5,13,Ng3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/3P1P1P/P1P1P1n1/2P1Q1P1/2KR1BNR w - -',"I told Gus that I understood why he castled as it's generally a good idea.  But 11.0-0-0?? was a blunder because of this three way fork.  Instead better was 11.Qf3 better was 11.Rh3 and that way everything is safe as it would no longer be possible for me to come on to g3.  One of the main ideas as Jack taught me was that you can't let the N advance too far because when it does they can become quite dangerous.  So you can't let it come that far.  In addition while Rh3 and Qh3 do not develop there are exceptions to the guidelines and one must deviate if there's an immeidiate threat loss of material mate etc.  For that I remembered something that is very important to teach and that's what I told him ""Consider all threats made by your opponent checks and captures.""   The other idea which I didn't mention as I'd be teaching too much is that this is also why 8.f4 was an inaccuracy for if he hadn't played that there's a good chance that my N would be stuck on d7 and f6."
216,5,14,1g3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/3P1P1P/P1P1PQP1/2P5/2KR1BNn b - -',! Of course I overlooked this so the R isn't free.  But white still loses a R for N.  Therefore it's a similar position to the first game against ION.  Unlike there however I remembered it here and was not going to overlook something like that.  The idea as kenneth_fiore said is that when teaching you must be cruel and not show lienence.  That's how you learn.  However since he is going to win my N in exchange regardless of what black does I will take on g3.  By doing this I win an extra pawn in the process for the reason outlined.
217,5,15,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3p4/3P1P1P/P1P1P1Q1/2P5/2KR1BN1 w - -',Normally I wouldn't play this as it appears pointless.  But there is a point and the idea here is that I see a weakness.  So the idea is trying to take advantage of your opponents weaknesses.  In this case being able to do so means that I start figuring out a way to expose his K and win a pawn.  The idea is forming a plan and as I learned from Susan in strategy while things can get in the way the idea is to form a plan.  And the way to plan accurately is by thinking about forcing moves which I'm doing.
218,5,16,1Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3p4/3P1P1P/P1P1PNQ1/2P5/2KR1B2 b - -',? Developing another piece.  But I told Gus that this is another mistake because of my next move.  Best was 15.Ne2  This time however it would be crammed because there are no outposts in the long term.  Also I remember this position from past games against the person who I've moved on from.  However it's better then what's about to unfold because it means that white is going to lose a pawn once I get my Q to a5  Afterall we talked about something like this a long time ago with the first person I coached.  Now tactics were mentioned that I could've won a pawn.  What I was planning then would've worked as it wins a pawn.  Now had he played 15.Ne2 I still would've played 15...Qa5 but it would not have lost a pawn.  Well I kept that in mind and am not going to miss that opportunity because the idea as noted is being teaching chess so you have to make things very difficult.
219,5,17,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/q2p4/3P1P1P/P1P1P1Q1/2PN4/2KR1B2 b - -',? Fixing the placement of his N.  But this is another mistake.  Either way white was going to lose a pawn but best was 16.a4  That's because I was planning to take on c3 of course anticipating that he'd advance his a pawn.  But with this move I'll take first which is going to win two pawns.
220,5,18,1Nf3,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3p4/3P1P1P/2q1PNQ1/2P5/1K1R1B2 b - -',"? I said I know why you played this as you were worried about the N. However it is important to look at the entire board. And in this position the N was not in danger because of the R. So if I had played ...Qxd2?? you could win the Q in return with Rxd2 But this move however loses another pawn. In this case almost any move was better then this.  What I allude to by seeing the entire is what the master mater would say which is being a spectator of your game.

229,5,27,2Bf3,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1pp1p2p/3pN3/3PqP1P/5BQ1/2P5/1K1R4 b - -',Not surprised.

231,5,29,2Bg4,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1pp1p2p/3pNq2/3P1PBP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 b - -',"But I like white's fighting spirit.  First he keeps in mind that if I go wrong he can win my Q.  However after my blunder with superandy I won't make that same mistake here as it's not as good for learning purposes.  More importantly however is the fact that white does not resign which makes me happier.  The idea is ""Fight Til the End"".  In addition this gives him back a pawn for now."
232,5,30,2Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1pp1pq1p/3pN3/3P1PBP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 w - -',Indirectly forced.
233,5,31,Bb7,b'r4rk1/pb3pp1/1pN1pq1p/3p4/3P1PBP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 w - -',However I will not allow him to pull a swindle which is I'm sure what he wants.  The idea is as therealjimfrior put it you don't give your student second chances.  Instead they have to win on their own merits.
234,5,32,Qe7,b'r4rk1/pb2qpp1/1p2p2p/3pN3/3P1PBP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 w - -',This is the start to an aggressive plan.  That is the idea of winning a pawn by checking on b4.  Of course I'm also aware that other things can cross in between those plans.  The main thing is the forcing moves as that's what it takes to think like a GM.  But even at non grandmaster it's important to do at all levels according to what Susan told me.  So I'm maintaining what she said for this game since things become second very quickly when I learn from her.
235,5,33,2f5,b'r4rk1/pb2qpp1/1p2p2p/3pNP2/3P2BP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 b - -',He wants me to take on f5 with the idea that after 27...exf5 28.Bxf5 g6 29.Nxg6 fxg6 30.Qxg6+ Kh8 31.Qxh6+ Kg8 32.Bh7+ Kh8 33.Rg1 Ba6 34.Bf5+ Qh7 after which the tables would've turned as now in order to prevent mate I'd have to lose my Q and my K would be even more exposed which would've given him a winning advantage.  
236,5,34,2Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/pb2qpp1/1p2p2p/3pNP2/3P2BP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 w - -',What I didn't realize however was that after 27...exf5 I can immeidately respond with the plan of 28.Qb4+  Although it doesn't seem that good white's K is worse exposed so I think that best was to take.  However I do have a long term plan in this position.  The goal is to be able to attack c2 with my Q and c R which is why I played.  Doing that would allow me to win the pawn and just about the game quickly.  But being able to execute this is a lot more difficult then this sounds.  And that's also what I allude to by things getting in the way of your plan as I recently learned.  Still it's good to think about things like this.
237,5,35,2fxe6,b'r1r3k1/pb2qpp1/1p2P2p/3pN3/3P2BP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 b - -',So he takes first.
238,5,36,2Qb4+,b'r1r3k1/pb3pp1/1p2P2p/3pN3/1q1P2BP/6Q1/2P5/1K1R4 w - -',Instead of taking back with 28...fxe6 I play this as now white is in worse trouble then he might think which was the plan since my 14th move which is was the idea behind 14...c6  What does that mean.  It's something that I've been trying to improve on for years due to graphomotor difficulties.  Graphomotor difficulties is a weakness that makes it difficult to read graphs which is why College Algebra with Trigonometry and Precalculus were killers.  Those same things also produced a weakness in chess since it's about reading graphs like algebraic tansformations which is what I was thinking about when it came to chess.  But I found that you don't have to struggle that much to find answers.  Instead if you think about how things get in the way but have a plan around that you can think ahead without miscalculations which was my goal.  In fact the reason I thought I was improving where I was wrong is that a certain someone was able to think ahead without miscalulating which was always my weakness.  I was surprised then that GM's could think over that far in advance.  He told me he could and calculated some moves but I still didn't know how to apply that method.  Although he's a bygone I don't completely forget about his teaching method because applying some of it suits my learning style.  But I thought I was improving and what I was promised came from Susan since the real answer is what I just noted about things getting in the way but still being able to form the plan.  The idea is that you just need to think about forcing moves.  In fact that's the secret with many GM's because the idea is that she tells you things that they aren't telling you.  That's part of what I saw when I signed up for the course and it's one of the main things that inspired me to take it.
239,5,37,2Kc1,b'r1r3k1/pb3pp1/1p2P2p/3pN3/1q1P2BP/6Q1/2P5/2KR4 b - -',Best.  29.Ka1?? would have lost a pawn and the Q for R because of 29...Qa4+ 30.Kb1 Qxc2 31.Ka1 Rc3 by which white must take the Q because anything else would result in immeidate mate.  For example if 32.Qf4 32...Ra3#  In addition 29.Ka2 would lose even quicker as black would have an automatic mate in 2.  29...Rxc2+ 30.Ka1 Qb2#
240,5,38,2f6,b'r1r3k1/pb4p1/1p2Pp1p/3pN3/1q1P2BP/6Q1/2P5/2KR4 w - -',Now that he found the best move instead of taking I advance forward.  This is because it doesn't just attack the N but I'm playing a move that I've seen from GM's as noted earlier.  Unfortunately this is where one can make mistake by overanalyzing those variations.  Do you remember that game with Mariann?  Well I could've won sooner but I overanalyzed the double B and N+B mate.  By doing so I missed opportunities that I wouldn't have missed.  And I went wrong in my game against Joann.  I played quite well except that from my favorite annotator GM Davorin there was a game I believe it was between Carlson and Topalov.  Where after seeing that an important pawn was directly pinned he added another attacker and it worked.  But that was since he the opponent wasn't as well developed.  But in my last game against jstevens1 it wasn't like that so when I added an attacker her K was able to move.  And in the process I wound up getting stuck in a fork.  Things went downhill quickly after that and I wound up losing.  So the idea is analyze and play through but try not to overanalyze.  That's the painful lesson I had to learn.
241,5,39,3e7,b'r1r3k1/pb2P1p1/1p3p1p/3pN3/1q1P2BP/6Q1/2P5/2KR4 b - -',With that being said white find a good move and tries to Q.  I thought for a moment that I was in real trouble as I'd lose a R to stop this.  But that isn't so.  I have double R's so if white dares to play 31.d8=Q+ I will stop it right in it's tracks.
242,5,40,3Rc3,b'r5k1/pb2P1p1/1p3p1p/3pN3/1q1P2BP/2r3Q1/2P5/2KR4 w - -',Now if his Q weren't there I would play 30...Qc3 and get the pawn.  But it's not possible so the idea is hitting it with the gain of tempo to enable to do some more damage.  The plan is getting off that square.
243,5,41,3Nd3,b'r5k1/pb2P1p1/1p3p1p/3p4/1q1P2BP/2rN2Q1/2P5/2KR4 b - -',Not surprised that he played this.  In fact this is what I anticipated but the result will nontheless be the same.  That's because I thought the check was dangerous.  As it turns out it's a nuicanse but it does however expose his K a little worse.  But as we know one can still last longer then you might think with an exposed K.
244,5,42,3Kd2,b'r5k1/pb2P1p1/1p3p1p/3p4/3P2BP/q1rN2Q1/2PK4/3R4 b - -',"More or less forced.  Actually I said I looked at this move and studied but this is a blunder. Best was 32.Kb1  And he said ""yes your right :{""  The reason is that black will be able to get which will at the very least lose a N.  However there is something that I missed there.  What I figure out a move later is that white doesn't have to lose his N.  Instead there's a different variation that would protect it but he'd still a lose a pawn.  So edited this comment a move later.  "
245,5,43,3Qc7,b'r5k1/pbQ1P1p1/1p3p1p/q2p4/3P2BP/2rN4/2PK4/3R4 b - -',What I missed until now was that white could've played 33.Nf2.  And now even if let's suppose 33...Rc4+ which is what I would've played he would still lose a pawn after 34.Rxd4 but the N is still safe.  However this is a serious blunder that will lose very quickly.  So I edited my previous comment and combined it with this blunder by saying Edit: Not a blunder but rather a mistake. The reason why 32.Kd2? was a mistake is that you would've had to lose a pawn at the least. There were other moves which now lose a piece or wind up in mate as I looked at different lines. But this move however With that being said this move is a blunder as it loses the Q. The danger was the discover check. So best was 33.Ke3 Sure I would take with 33...Rxc2 but then even after 34...Ba6 all you've lost was another pawn as the N can get out. But with this move you lose much more then just that.  What I'm alluding to by a lot more is the Q.  In fact after that white will be left with no good moves left which is where the game chat ends.
246,5,44,3c3,b'r5k1/pbr1P1p1/1p3p1p/q2p4/3P2BP/2PN4/3K4/3R4 b - -',Now one would think that 34.Ke3 was better but I would've pinned his N with 34...Qa3 followed by 35...Rc3 which would've won the N and there would've been no way out.  So as noted there are no good moves left.
247,5,45,Rxe7+,b'r5k1/pb2r1p1/1p3p1p/3p4/3P2BP/2qN4/4K3/3R4 w - -',Taking advantage of his weaknesses.  And no matter where he goes I will win that N.
248,5,46,Re3+,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/3p4/3q2BP/3Nr1K1/8/3R4 w - -',No matter where he went this is what I would've played.  That's because I'm trying now to centralize his K until it's confined to one square where I would mate.  But this time I don't need my K to do so.  This shows the importace of protecting material.
249,5,47,Rxd3,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/3p4/3q3P/3r1BK1/8/3R4 w - -',Even if he ran back with his K this is the move I would've still played knowing that it wins another piece because if now 39.Rxd3 39...Qxd3

252,5,50,4Kg3,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/3p4/7P/3r1BK1/1q6/3R4 b - -',Indirectly forced because if white moved back to the first rank I'd immediately liquidate with 41...Rxd1+ when ahead.
253,5,51,4Rxf3+,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/3p4/7P/5rK1/1q6/3R4 w - -',So I give him my R for his B.  But this is a combination I learned about where you give up something worth more for a more dangerous attack.  
254,5,52,4Kxf3,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/3p4/7P/5K2/1q6/3R4 b - -',"Instead of taking however had he moved back with 41.Kg4 (which was the only other move) I'd still mate very quickly.  41...Qg2+ 42.Kh5 Rf5#  However black is still going mate very soon.  What does this mean?  What it boils down is that mate was inevitable no matter how you dossed dice so white might as well have taken my R regardless.  That's from an expression that Jack introduced me to.  It was the first game that I won against him.  He was in a similar situation and would've been mated in one.  So he took and said ""I might as well because I have nothing better.""  Of course I kept that in mind and now calculate that mate."
255,5,53,4d4+,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/8/3p3P/5K2/1q6/3R4 w - -',So without further adue it starts right here.  But how I figured this out was calculating lines but in the calculation I took note that this is a discovered check which white cannot get out of.
256,5,54,4Kf4,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/8/3p1K1P/8/1q6/3R4 b - -',Now to start calculating all lines which I did some in the game as this is how I improve.  But as homework I'm doing the rest.  Let's say he played 42.Kg4 as opposed to this.  I would've responded with 42...Qg2+ and if 43.Kh5 I'd mate with 43...Bf3#  If instead of 43.Kh5 he played 43.Kf5 I'd mate almost as quickly.  43...Bc8+ 44.Kf4 (forced) Qg4#  And if 42.Kg3 42...Qg2+ 43.Kf4 (forced) Qf3#  So either way you look at it mate is inevitable.
257,5,55,Qf3#,b'r5k1/pb4p1/1p3p1p/8/3p2KP/5q2/8/3R4 w - -',Overall white played north of his rating.  But the morals are that in Queen Pawn Opening it is generally not a good idea to play Nc3 or ...Nc6 early because the idea is taht those c pawns are important.  Also develop your pieces and control the center.  For example white played 3.h4?! when he could used the time to develop with 3.Nf3 or he could've brought his DSB into play early.  That way I wouldn't have an advantage as early.  Instead developed earlier and one step closer to controlling the center.  By playing that he didn't just fall behind in development where I could gain even more tempo to develop but I got the head lead in center control which helped maintain an advantage.  But the main moral is to pay attention to all threats.  Sometimes that even means giving up or delaying K safety to do this.  For example instead of castling white needed to protect his pieces.  By castling he lost material.  And there were other examples that led to an overwhelming advantage for black until I was able to force mate.  So the idea is development and being aware of threats made by your opponent.  @vesper2: If you can remember this I'm sure that your rating will climb to 1100 before you know it.

But if white now plays Nf3 Bg4+ and white will have to accept BxNf3 doubling and isolating his pawns. In general it seems that black gets some activity in return of his awakward Q's position. Black's game will be aimed at a ""sensible"" dsb's developement via g7 h6 or following the Q after some Qb4 Bd6 or c5. Black also has to put on the agende c6 (not Nc6) since white's sole developed N is potentially threatening a c7 fork. "

Losing the chance to play c4 forcing me to exchange or retire the B (g6 BxB NxB seems a bad idea). After c4 all white's developement's promlems will vanish and he will take a deserved revenge. On the other side a queenside castling means a target for me. Qb4 was already an option one move before and it still is. 
338,10,10,c6,b'r3kb1r/pp1nqppp/2p2n2/6Bb/8/2NP1P2/PPPQB1PP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Don't lose temper. First the first. No Nd5 and c7 as a flight square for my Q or B. Besides I have some control of the center. White can freely play d4 in order to activate his lsb. All this requires at least c6 as a defender of d5 and b5. Still I lost the chance to play Qb4 and that will cost me a lot in the near future.

Note that if after Nc6 g4 Nxg4 fxN Bxg4 would have been possible and only in this case I would have taken with the N on c6. But if I take on c6 thinking in jumping to d5 asap... this invites NxN cxNd5 which could be potentially good for an attack via the c column and the weak a and b pawns with few pieces coming in to help. In all this process I forgot to consider another obvious factor latent in the position: my own royal pieces's vulnerable position. "

But now: let's analyze the two royal pins that are about to happen. Black's Bh6 can easily be countered by just ONE move: f4. This will do. But mind: only because of that pawn. White's threat is worse: the only thing I can do not to lose the Q after Bd1 is Nd5. Now if he tries to kick my N he will win it with a pawn d4 or f4. f4! Well after f4xN I will be free to play Bh6 and complete the royal pin! But after d4 I have o-o-o and the WQ becomes target of my R if dxN... BUT: the tempoes white uses to take my N are enough for me to castle and get out or the royal pin. If f4 is not playable MY pin is unstoppable. Got it?
346,10,18,1Bf1,b'r3kb1r/pp1nqp2/2p2pb1/7p/6P1/2NP1P2/PPPQ3P/2K1RBNR b kq -',The alternative was f4 at once but it didn't work because it would have given me tempo to castle and run out of the pin OR even Nd5 and if fxN BxQ+ where white would have had only two minor pieces for the Q.

348,10,20,1f4,b'r3kb1r/pp2qp2/2p2pb1/4n2p/5PP1/2NP4/PPPQ3P/2K1RBNR b kq -',? White should have used the other pawn. This would he had done if he would have been aware of the danger hanging of his RP. On the other side f5 is also a threat forcing me to Bh7 allowing gxh5. Here still Bh6 seemed to be the move but if Bh6 g5 and after fxg5 my pin threat is gone for a critical tempo! But again: if white takes the N I will have Bh6. The position is tactically far more complex than my weak annotation.

It's hard to see some move for white but Bh3 has at least some chances: BxQ+ KxB (and black has one tempo to stop) gxh5+(disc. from Bh3) Kb8 hxBg6 and black is a little embarassed since RxBh3 is just losing after NxR and the white's f pawn can become dangerous.
353,10,25,1Qxf6,b'2kr3r/pp3p2/2p2qbb/7p/6P1/2NP4/PPPQ3P/2K1RBNR w - -',Now white should consider that the only defence of Bf1 is Re1 so he can't use it to shield the royal pin and limit the loss to an exchange... and this is the main reason for Bh3 instead of the central exchange plan.

But if a GM plays something else then he or she has kept castling in mind but this is better.  The question is why?  I think that without a pawn in between it puts pressure on black's center.

However I would've preferred 6...e5 so that black would gain time needed to continue development while white would be forced to protect.  In addition this appears to create a bad bishop for Anand.  But with 6...e5 however it appears stronger.  Now under no grounds am I calling this a blunder or inaccuracy as I don't know what's going in their minds but I'm just giving my preference and how I would've responded.

Actually this is somewhat similar to what I saw in that recent annotation with charleshiggie and brigadecommander.  The idea is that fianchettoing does to an extent add to that chain which would be the logic for 8.g4 as opposed to 8.g3  But when that B comes out it can become mean and nasty just like what I saw in there.
419,12,6,Nfd7,b'rnbqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I liked where it was before.  But I understand why Anand played this though.  The idea is finding a better square for his N.  That is on b6 which he will do on his next move.
420,12,7,Qd2,b'rnbqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',The idea is so that white can castle Q side.  Personally I don't see anything wrong with bringing the LSB into play but I like this move better.  And this time I agree that castling long is better then castling short.  That's because of how open the K would become after 0-0 whereas with 0-0-0 it is enclosed by the pawns and thus well protected.
421,12,8,Nb6,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/pn1pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R w KQkq -',As noted black finds a better outpost for his N.

In addition even if it weren't for that problem I still like the arrangement better as black will be able to bring onto c5 or e5.  Both of those squares appear stronger then on c6.
423,12,10,1Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/pn1pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R b kq -',But white now plays the move that I noted earlier.  Not only are the R's connected but are bound to be dangerous.  While we have only gone through 11 moves and are in the early mid game I'd say that this is already almost as interesting as the game between charleshiggie and brigadecommander which I really enjoyed especially with 4 Q's.  While it won't happen here the position has become a little different then unusual for both sides.  First with GM games I typically see them castle K side though the other way is not unusual.  What makes it different however is that both of white's bishops are side to side which I don't often see in a game like this.  Second normally I would've already seen black place his d N on the other outpost.  But he is not going to do it on the next move.  Most importantly in all other games even with GM right after a fianchetto I see the player develop his or her B right away either on the longest diagnol (which I see most often) or on h6 or a6.  This however is the first game where I see someone prolong it for several moves.  And the fact that we're in a somewhat unusual position at GM level between some of the best players adds value to the game in my opinion.
424,12,11,1Kb1,b'r2qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/pn1pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R b kq -',Normally I wouldn't understand this as we're not in an endgame which is when you'd use the K as a weapon.  But it makes sense here as the K is safer.  The long term plan that black had was weakening her K with an eventual ...d5 followed by ...Bc5 and ...Qc7 putting pressure on white's K.  By playing this Judit stops that in her tracks.
425,12,12,1Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/1b1n1ppp/pn1pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2NBBP2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R w k -',As we're about to see this put's pressure on white's c N.
426,12,13,1Bg5,b'2rqkb1r/1b1n1ppp/pn1pp3/1p4B1/3NP1P1/2NB1P2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R b k -',As usual you typically see a GM attack a piece against his or her opponent.  The idea of course is gaining tempo because with grandmaster time is more important then your average chess game.
427,12,14,1Qc7,b'2r1kb1r/1bqn1ppp/pn1pp3/1p4B1/3NP1P1/2NB1P2/PPPQ3P/1K1R3R w k -',And when he or she attacks the opponent often reattacks or puts extra pressure when retreating.
428,12,15,1Rhe1,b'2r1kb1r/1bqn1ppp/pn1pp3/1p4B1/3NP1P1/2NB1P2/PPPQ3P/1K1RR3 b k -',Attacking the center in another way.  But personally I would've played 14.Rc1 because like what I saw in a recent annotation yes I would be worried about my N on c3.  However with further analysis it wouldn't have helped since the R is behind the pawn so I like this move for the reason outlined.
429,12,16,1Ne5,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2ppp/pn1pp3/1p2n1B1/3NP1P1/2NB1P2/PPPQ3P/1K1RR3 w k -',Although it seems protected from white's next move we can infer that the idea behind this was to put pressure on the white pawn.  But I would've played 14...Qxc3  Here's the thing as it is what I was alluding to by pressure on the c N.  Before this move was played which was the plan black could not play 13...Rxc3 because it would lose a R for N due to white's Q.  But now there's added protection so that risk exists because after 14...Qxc3 white dare not take back with 15.Qxc3?? or 15...Rxc3 16.bxc3 not only losing a piece but her K would become exposed.  And this time against one of the best players white would lose.  However I gather that the plan would not work because grandmasters do not just overlook moves like that so something tells me that taking on c3 would be a blunder since Anand will not play that in this game.
430,12,17,1f4,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2ppp/pn1pp3/1p2n1B1/3NPPP1/2NB4/PPPQ3P/1K1RR3 b k -',But with this move now if black played 15...Qxc3 supposing that it wouldn't be a blunder he doesn't win a piece back because of this as white would sooner or later take back on e5.  It makes sense because Anand was intending to when it was safe take on c3.  So this prevents him from doing so.
431,12,18,1Nec4,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2ppp/pn1pp3/1p4B1/2nNPPP1/2NB4/PPPQ3P/1K1RR3 w k -',With that being said not only is the N safe but black finds an even better square for it.  Now I would've looked at 15...Nf3?? as it appears to win at the least a R for N with an ugly fork.  But after analyzing it I wouldn't play it because the N on d4 stops it so that if white dared played white would win that N.  I also looked at 15...Ned7 where now it would be crammed.  Most importantly however is that I remember that homework by charleshiggie in his annotation which as usual was and is good to do for improvement.  So that if Janet took with the R as opposed to N she would've lost a pawn.  Well a similar thing could be said because the plan behind this move is when the Q retreats 16...b4  And after 17.Ne2 (as other moves lose the N) comes 17...Na4 18.b3 Nxc3 19.bxc3 bxc3 winning a pawn.   Therefore I think this is the best in this position.  
432,12,19,1Qc1,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2ppp/pn1pp3/1p4B1/2nNPPP1/2NB4/PPP4P/1KQRR3 b k -',But not suprisingly white sees the threat and does not allow it.  The reason for this threat was if the Q moved from the dark squares from the Q side where she castled.
433,12,20,1h6,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2pp1/pn1pp2p/1p4B1/2nNPPP1/2NB4/PPP4P/1KQRR3 w k -',Putting pressure on her B and gaining time in the process.
434,12,21,1Nd5,b'2r1kb1r/1bq2pp1/pn1pp2p/1p1N2B1/2nNPPP1/3B4/PPP4P/1KQRR3 b k -',Not surprisingly as noted she reattacks.

Therefore despite considerating that I definitely would not have taken either.  But I would not know what to do here.  However it appears that Anand found the best way out of this by reattacking the N and gaining time which he will need.
436,12,23,1Nb3,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pn1pp2p/1pqN2B1/2n1PPP1/1N1B4/PPP4P/1KQRR3 b k -',While 18.Nf3? would seem good the problem is that it runs right into 18...Qf2 which would lose a pawn with the fork.  And 18.Ne2 would result in the same problem.  Anywherelse just loses the N so while I don't like the way it looks as well since it appears to jam in the K structure this is indirectly forced.  
437,12,24,1Qf2,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pn1pp2p/1p1N2B1/2n1PPP1/1N1B4/PPP2q1P/1KQRR3 w k -',Nontheless Anand still plays this.
438,12,25,1Ref1,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pn1pp2p/1p1N2B1/2n1PPP1/1N1B4/PPP2q1P/1KQR1R2 b k -',Hitting the Q and black dare not take with 19...Qxh2 or he will lose his Q after 20.Rh1 Qg2 21.Rg1 Qf2 22.Bh4 as his Q would now be trapped.
439,12,26,1Qg2,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pn1pp2p/1p1N2B1/2n1PPP1/1N1B4/PPP3qP/1KQR1R2 w k -',Indirectly forced as anything else would've lost the Q.  So white now takes advantage by exchanging black's stronger N.  The reason that the N on c4's weaker is because it's more or less boxed by not only white's LSB but her pieces on the first rank.
440,12,27,2Qe3,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pn1pp2p/1p4B1/4PPP1/1N1BQ3/PPP3qP/1K1R1R2 b k -',But that exchanges benefits white and with it while material is technically even I give white a slight edge because of this move as now black will have to figure how to protect his N and he also can no longer complete development or castle.  In addition his strong N is gone leaving with his weak one.  However white's pieces are better placed.  
441,12,28,2Nc4,b'2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/p2pp2p/1p4B1/2n1PPP1/1N1BQ3/PPP3qP/1K1R1R2 w k -',In this position I would've considered 21...Nd7 but that would cram it.  Plus it's a weak N so retreating to b7 would make it weaker.  Therefore I believe that attempting to get rid of that N is the right choice.
442,12,29,2Qa7,b'2r1kb1r/Qb3pp1/p2pp2p/1p4B1/2n1PPP1/1N1B4/PPP3qP/1K1R1R2 b k -',In my opinion however this is better.  Not for attacks or gain of tempo but rather this attack is a fork.  And while black will take back he has a pawn chain whereas she does not.  And his is quite nasty.  This will weaken it so when an exchange occurs her advantages will increase.  However it gets much worse for black as we're about to see.  And with that I now believe that the game is lost for black.  Even though it doesn't appear so the position is deteriorating much quicker then one would think.
443,12,30,Rb8,b'1r2kb1r/5pp1/Q2pp2p/1p4B1/2n1bPP1/1N1B4/PPP3qP/1K1R1R2 w k -',Having to protect the b pawn which was her plan.

445,12,32,2hxg5,b'1r2kb1r/5pp1/Q2pp3/1p4p1/2n1bPP1/1N1B4/PPP3qP/1K1R2R1 w k -',?? Although GM's generally don't blunder things I call this an exception.  Sure black was going to lose something.  But I believe that better was 24...Qf2 and best was 24...Qxh7 not only protecting the Q but despite winning a piece 25.Bxe4 black has got a pawn in return.  By playing this however he will lose his Q for a R.  And right after that white will add insult to injury by liquidating.  It is worth noting that black will only be down by 1 point but considering that he's losing the Q makes it irrelevant as Anand is already in big trouble.
446,12,33,2Qa4+,b'1r2kb1r/5pp1/3pp3/6p1/Q1p2PP1/1N6/PPP3bP/1K1R4 b k -',Seeing that black is going to lose another and his K will become exposed lest he loses a R Anand resigns.  As noted this game started to become very interesting by the 11th move.  And the peak of it started on white's 24th move making it the most interesting game I've studied in about a month since I studied two GM annotations by favorite annotator which both involved game with Carlson.  But what we learned like that of the private annotation is the importance of completing development and getting the K to safety.  Like then Anand could've used the time to develop his remaining piece and advance the d pawn one more square so that it wouldn't be his bad bishop.  And he also could've protected his K.  If black had done this I don't think that black would've gotten himself in trouble.  So what this shows is that even at GM levels and with for that matter the best players it's important to develop your pieces control the center and get the K to safety.  Failing to do so could and often will get yourself into trouble as we saw here.

I face alot less of these types of situations and this raises my discomfort level alot during mid game. at this stage is when i think i started to focus too much on his LSB and started playing around defending that diagonal.

Kenneth told me g6 was stronger. i know the benefits of g6 to keep off Queens or LSB's from h5. but i told myself all his pieces are heading queen side. cramping his DSB was more beneficial and i doubt he will use the tempo to play his E pawn was my thought. and this also compliments my battle for dark squares i thought.

487,14,0,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/8/B2pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Unlike before this opponent's style is somewhat well known to me.  So I anitcipated that this is where it would be end up.  I calculated and knew what to do.  Sure it's not practice where you play through the variations.  Instead it's the real deal where the moves were made during the last game.  And using memory techniques like I did in a couple of endgames homework assignments and studies from unusual openings I remembered what happened last time and applied it for this.  Therefore I was well prepared.
488,14,1,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/8/B2pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',With that being said I anticipated 6...b5 in which case I would've played 7.Bb3 which is the most common place to run back.  But Bernie played this which is also a good move as it develops.
489,14,2,d3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/8/B2pP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So I develop with the plan being to develop my N and bring it to a better outpost like I've done before.  This also acheives a good pawn chain which I didn't think was important until the end game.  But I learned shortly afterwards from a lecture by Susan Polgar.  What she implied is that a pawn chain is very important during the openings.
490,14,3,Qh4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/8/B2pP2q/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',?! As I also know things can get in the way of your long term plans.  When things intercede you take care of threats and find forcing moves.  With that being said this is an inaccuracy by black because he stopped developing and brought his Q out way to early.  I know the intention as it's similar to SM.  But he wants to mate but this is what we call a cheapo tactic and unsound.

But after giving this time and thought I decided to play this.  The reason being is to punish Bernie for his last move.  By doing this not only do I refute the threat but now I'm gaining a tempo needed for development as the Q needs to protection.  And timing is important.
492,14,5,Nd2,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1pqppp/2pb4/8/B2pP3/3P2P1/PPPN1P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So as noted I used the time to continue my development.

494,14,7,1Qg4,b'r3k1nr/pb1pqppp/2pb4/1p6/3pP1Q1/1B1P2P1/PPPN1P1P/R1B2RK1 b kq -',My goal is not to win the g pawn as it appears.  If it were just that I wouldn't play this as it would be unsound.  I knew black would defend in the way he is in which case I knew that I could waist a little more of his time.  By doing so I'm able to find a better outpost for my N which was the real idea behind this move.  I also could have done that here but my goal was doing in such a way where the mobility of my Q isn't as limited.  That's because it now has more places to manoeuvre and as we know mobility is very important.  In addition when I also kept in mind that 11...h5 or 11...f5 won't help against the threat I have.  If they did I also would not have played this.  So I really do gain tempo and thus find a good place for my Q
495,14,8,O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/pb1pqp1p/2pb2p1/1p6/3pP1Q1/1B1P1NP1/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',? After the game Bernie told me that he prefers to castle short just like me.  But with the pressure on the K side castling K side would be quite risky and would likely get him into trouble.  So he had to castle on opposite wings.  However castling could've waited a move later.  Better was 12...c5 better was 12...Bc5 because this move loses a pawn.  In fact seeing that I won the same pawn last time and in a similar position I did not anticipate this at all.  In other words I thought that he would play these moves so that I could not take since I was able to do this last time.  Then he would castle on his next move.  
496,14,9,h5,b'2kr2nr/pb1pqp2/2pb2p1/1p5p/3NP1Q1/1B1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - h6',Getting aggressive and seeing having defended his h R and seeing now that my Q is in a bad spot now he attacks.
497,14,10,1Qf3,b'2kr2nr/pb1pqp2/2pb2p1/1p5p/3NP3/1B1P1QP1/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 b - -',I was not going to play 14.Qh3 because black would threaten ...g4 which would lose tempo as he'd likely answer with 14...g5 right away.  I also considered 14.Qe2 but this however gives the K better protection.  More importantly is that black can play 14...c5 and if he did that I would retreat with 15.Ne2.  But if I retreated my Q to e2 it would no longer be an option so I'd have to play 15.Nf3 in which case it's now safe to say that the N would be a little crammed.  And if not I'd feel a little uncomfortable and overwhelmed which I was not going to allow.  In addition although this was not my main goal I am now threatening 15.Qxf7  However it come to mind because of the inaccuracy I made by not playing Ng5 a move earlier which allowed him to defend much more easily.  But by retreating here unlike before it's not so easy and black will still have to struggle which is something if I recall correctly that ION noted last time.  The idea is that when ahead in addition to liquidation of pieces you also want to put pressure on your opponent and make it more difficult to defend his position since the idea being as I also learned from Susan is improving your position.
498,14,11,1Rf8,b'2k2rnr/pb1pqp2/2pb2p1/1p5p/3NP3/1B1P1QP1/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black also could've advanced his f pawn.  But this is the most common to defend it as it usually involves the R.
499,14,12,1Bf4,b'2k2rnr/pb1pqp2/2pb2p1/1p5p/3NPB2/1B1P1QP1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Wanting to increase the pressure liquidate and eliminate my bad bishop I play this.  I also considered 15.Bg5 but this time when mentioning it I did not overlook that it would be blunder.  That's because even without analyze the board I accurately saw that it would a piece.  With that being said if 15.Bg5?? 15...f6 16.Bh4 g5 and the B is locked in and thus trapped. 
500,14,13,1Bxf4,b'2k2rnr/pb1pqp2/2p3p1/1p5p/3NPb2/1B1P1QP1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',?! I am surprised however that he played this.  And I view it as an inaccuracy because not only do I liquidate B's while ahead but this is his strong B because the other for now is confined to b7 and c6 so it has less mobility.  But my DSB is weaker then my LSB since the B on lightsquares is on a long diagnol that you'd typically see from a fianchetto and can in the long run do some damage.  Better was to attack my N as this would give him the time needed to complete development and at the very least prevent me from exchanging.  In addition I'm going to take back with my Q because if 15...gxf4 will leave my K too wide open and I lost a game against Jack by making a mistake like that.  Second this strengthens my Q structure.  However it is as we know an interesting position so anything can change.
501,14,14,f6,b'2k2rnr/pb1pq3/2p2pp1/1p5p/3NPQ2/1B1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',?! I don't why he played this but I view it as another inaccuracy.  First black could've completed his development at once with 16...Nf6  Second I can liquidate further with that initiative and in the process it will no longer be possible for him to complete development.  With that being said I'm confident that I have a win yet as I've mentioned I'll be careful won't take risky chances or underestimate what he's capable of doing. 
502,14,15,1Rfe1,b'2k3rr/pb1pq3/2p2pp1/1p5p/3NPQ2/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',So this is where I decide to like before attack the center.  
503,14,16,1Qe5,b'2k3rr/pb1p4/2p2pp1/1p2q2p/3NPQ2/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',?! He is probably trying to find a forcing move but in my opinion this is another inaccuracy as it will allow me to trade Q's while I'm ahead.  I think that best 18...g5 which would gain tempo for him as now I have something to be weary of.  BTW unlike the last game I considered 19.Nf3? but the reason I didn't play it is that he would win back a pawn and isolate my pawns 19...Qxb2 which was something that I wasn't going to allow.
504,14,17,fxe5,b'2k3rr/pb1p4/2p3p1/1p2p2p/3NP3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Naturally attacking my pawn.

506,14,19,2d6,b'2k3rr/pb6/2pp2p1/1p2p2p/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Achieving another pawn chain which strengthens his connected pawns in the process.
507,14,20,2Ng5,b'2k3rr/pb6/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',The idea here is applying what I've learned.  So the plan is should things stay like this 22.Nf7  This time however I miscalculated because when playing this I thought it would be 22.Nf7+ since it appears to be a check which would also be a fork.  Therefore I thought that Bernie would be forced to compromise his position and waste more tempo to prevent the threat.  I miscalculated because 22.Nf7 isn't a fork as it lands on the same square as the K.  Therefore he'd still be able to get out of it in which case he might for all I know get some initiative back as now I'm the one that would lose tempo.
508,14,21,2Kd7,b'6rr/pb1k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',We are not in an endgame yet so I am not sure why he played this.  Without getting overconfident this is where I start thinking that I could cause a lot of damage since the K appears exposed.  Of course you can sometimes survive.  But I was seeing if I could do something to force a win since there appears to be a potential weakness.  However this isn't so and black has ways.
509,14,22,2Re3,b'6rr/pb1k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/R5K1 b - -',So I play this with a long term plan.  The plan is organize my R and N.  In this case leave the N where it was place black in check on the seventh rank with my R.  Therefore what I'm implying is an eventual Rf7+ which would cause further damage on black's damage.
510,14,23,2Rgf8,b'5r1r/pb1k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/R5K1 w - -',However black sees my plan and stops it with this move.  
511,14,24,2Rae1,b'5r1r/pb1k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 b - -',I decide to double up since it's known to be dangerous.  But better was 23.Rf3 with the idea of liquidation since I'm still ahead.
512,14,25,2Bc8,b'2b2r1r/p2k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 w - -',I anticipated 23...Rb8 which adds a defender to his B.  But with this move I now play what  I could've a move earlier and therefore am able to exchange.
513,14,26,2Rf3,b'2b2r1r/p2k4/2pp2p1/1p2p1Np/4P3/3P1RP1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Of course black doesn't have to take but when he does I take back.
514,14,27,Ke7,b'2b4r/p3k3/2pp2p1/1p2p2p/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Now that we're in an endgame it makes sense for black to bring his K out.  However I'm not ready to do that quite yet.
515,14,28,2Nh4,b'2b4r/p3k3/2pp2p1/1p2p2p/4P2N/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Thinking about forced moves the plan is to win the g pawn.  Not surprised that black protects but when he does I have a plan.  I also thought it'd be difficult to defend g6 which would require the loss of tempo.  However the K can do even more then it might appear which is where I also miscalculate.  Nontheless I knew that he was going to protect and I have ideas for when he does.
516,14,29,2Re3,b'2b4r/p7/2pp1kp1/1p2p2p/4P2N/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/6K1 b - -',This is it and now I'm planning long term.  The idea is that eventually I can reposition my N on f3 whilst leaving my R active on the f file.  The plan behind is to be able to do damage on the sixth and seventh if and when I can deliver a dangerous check.
517,14,30,2Kg7,b'2b4r/p5k1/2pp2p1/1p2p2p/4P2N/3PR1P1/PPP2P1P/6K1 w - -',But once he plays this however I know that the feasibility is gone.  Therefore I will repost my N on f3 immediately and see if I can find anything else.
518,14,31,Be6,b'7r/p5k1/2ppb1p1/1p2p2p/4P3/3PRNP1/PPP2P1P/6K1 w - -',I almost overlooked it and played the wrong move.  But I figured it out before making the mistake.  His plan is to win back a pawn and isolate my good pawns.
519,14,32,2b3,b'7r/p5k1/2ppb1p1/1p2p2p/4P3/1P1PRNP1/P1P2P1P/6K1 b - -',I also considered 29.a3 but this move leaves with a better pawn structure in my opinion as now it is easy to get a solid pawn chain whereas it's would be more difficult with the other move.
520,14,33,2a5,b'7r/6k1/2ppb1p1/pp2p2p/4P3/1P1PRNP1/P1P2P1P/6K1 w - a6',To connect his other two pawns.
521,14,34,3Ng5,b'7r/6k1/2ppb1p1/pp2p1Np/4P3/1P1PR1P1/P1P2P1P/6K1 b - -',Not even to win his B as he easily has ways out.  However without any miscalculation the plan works because retreating will lose tempo.  And once he does this I come up with a different threat so Rf3 which  I will play right after was the idea behind this move.
522,14,35,3Rf3,b'7r/3b2k1/2pp2p1/pp2p1Np/4P3/1P1P1RP1/P1P2P1P/6K1 b - -',The idea being that I'm now threatening 32.Rf7+  Of course he can do something especially with 31...Be8  But there would be a lot of pressure on the seventh rank which would be almost overwhelming to black.  He can however do something about it but the entire plan was to put him under pressure.  The idea being is that when under pressure you tend to make mistakes which is what gives the opponent a bigger advantage.
523,14,36,3Rf8,b'5r2/3b2k1/2pp2p1/pp2p1Np/4P3/1P1P1RP1/P1P2P1P/6K1 w - -',?! I am surprised that he responds with this move.  I would've played 31...Be8 in this position.  By playing this however I once again liquidate.  This time our remaining R's not to mention that he hasn't gotten anything back yet.
524,14,37,3f4,b'5k2/3b4/2pp2p1/pp2p1Np/4PP2/1P1P2P1/P1P4P/6K1 b - f3',So the plan is now to get rid of his remaining pawns with exchanges.  I remembered from a couple of games one or two against Jack and one against dmaestro that one pawn can make or break a game.  Therefore if we get rid of pawns and I have one extra I might be able to win.  Of course however Bernie is a very difficult opponent and not to my surprise will get out of this.
525,14,38,3Kg7,b'8/3b2k1/2pp2p1/pp2p1Np/4PP2/1P1P2P1/P1P4P/6K1 w - -',Trying to put pressure on my N but before he can do that I will take.  Now I did consider 33.f5 but with an added defender he would get back in pawn.  In other words if 34.f5 34...gxf5 and if 35.exf5 black has 35...Bxf5  Then I looked to see if these variations would lead to a passed pawn afterwards but they don't.  If however I were to get a passer from that then I would've played the latter move.  Therefore as a result of my decision not to give him back pawn for now I will exchange right away.
526,14,39,3Nf3,b'8/3b2k1/2p3p1/pp2p2p/4P3/1P1P1NP1/P1P4P/6K1 b - -',Still remembering what happened last time where I didn't play Ng5 a move earlier and at the same time applying what I learned about forcing moves I decide to play this.  That's because I knew ahead of time that black must do something to protect e5.
527,14,40,3Kf6,b'8/3b4/2p2kp1/pp2p2p/4P3/1P1P1NP1/P1P4P/6K1 w - -',As anticipated.
528,14,41,3d4,b'8/3b4/2p2kp1/pp2p2p/3PP3/1P3NP1/P1P4P/6K1 b - -',? Knowing that I'm still a pawn up I once again decide to force an exchange and for the same reason.  The idea is remaining up a pawn whilst getting rid of his pawns.  I also thought that when all was said and done I'd have a passed pawn since the e pawn will be there without other pawns in front of or right next to it.  However I miscalculated because with this exchange Bernie will win back a pawn.  I think that best was 36.c4 and even if we don't exchange I'm still remain ahead by a pawn.
529,14,42,Ke5,b'8/3b4/2p3p1/pp2k2p/3NP3/1P4P1/P1P4P/6K1 w - -',That's because of this fork as now I have to give up my e pawn in order to keep my N alive. 
530,14,43,3c4,b'8/3b4/2p3p1/pp5p/2P1k3/1P4P1/P3N2P/6K1 b - c3',Therefore I'm now trying to get a draw.  The goal here is for a dead position.  So what I'm trying to do is get rid of our pawns and perhaps his N with my B.  That isn't however my real goal but is to eliminate all pawns and with it the game should end in a dead position.  
531,14,44,Kd3,b'8/3b4/2p3p1/p6p/2P5/3k2P1/P3N2P/6K1 w - -',Not surprised that he played this.  At first I thought that I was going to go from a pawn up to a pawn down.  But at the last minute I find a way around it which is always what one should do anyhow.
532,14,45,4Nf4+,b'8/3b4/2p3p1/p6p/2P2N2/3k2P1/P6P/6K1 b - -',This is it.  That's because black can and will take.  When he does capture on c4 I will recapture on g6.
533,14,46,Kb4,b'8/3b4/2p3N1/p6p/1k6/6P1/P6P/6K1 w - -',Going after my a pawn.
534,14,47,4Ne5,b'8/3b4/2p5/p3N2p/1k6/6P1/P6P/6K1 b - -',So I'll do what I can to protect it.  
535,14,48,4Be8,b'4b3/8/2p5/p3N2p/1k6/6P1/P6P/6K1 w - -',This is what I'm alluding to.  I'm not sure why he moved there but I would've played 43...Ka3! winning that pawn at last.
536,14,49,4Kf2,b'4b3/8/2p5/p3N2p/1k6/6P1/P4K1P/8 b - -',Best was 44.Nd3+  That's because black can now win that pawn with no way for white to stop it should Bernie find the right move.
537,14,50,4a4,b'4b3/8/2p5/4N2p/pk6/6P1/P4K1P/8 w - -',Best was 44...Ka3! winning a pawn.  But he put a finger with the inference based on gesture is wait a minute.  And then he found a different move.  The plan was to promote but it would be easier had he taken.  
538,14,51,4Nd3+,b'4b3/8/2p5/7p/pk6/3N2P1/P4K1P/8 b - -',At last I played what I mentioned earlier.  The idea being is that everything remains even for now.
539,14,52,4Ka3,b'4b3/8/2p5/7p/p7/k2N2P1/P4K1P/8 w - -',Still trying to win my pawn.  So I ask myself what can be done to protect a2.  As it turns out there is only one way to do so for now.
540,14,53,4Nc1,b'4b3/8/2p5/7p/p7/k5P1/P4K1P/2N5 b - -',And I find the move.  But what I miscalculated however was blacks next move.  As it turns out he is going to win the pawn afterall by forking my pawn and N.
541,14,54,4Kb2,b'4b3/8/2p5/7p/p7/6P1/Pk3K1P/2N5 w - -',Consequently there is no way around it.
542,14,55,4Nf4,b'4b3/8/2p5/7p/p4N2/6P1/k4K1P/8 b - -',This is where I thought I was lost.  But I am still going to do what I can for counterplay.  In other words instead of thinking about resignation I'm being as brave as possible.  So now it's about becoming aggressive and trying to stay in even if it means hope chess.  That's because in reality I'm hoping to get counterplay.  
543,14,56,4c5,b'4b3/8/8/2p4p/p4N2/6P1/k4K1P/8 w - -',"The idea is that he has a passed pawn and as we know ""Passed pawns must be pushed."""
544,14,57,4h3,b'4b3/8/8/2p4p/p4N2/6PP/k4K2/8 b - -',?? Seeing how dangerous his pawns are I was trying to prevent his h pawn from becoming a passer.  But according to Jack which he says after the game was over this was the losing blunder.  Best was 49.Nd3 and if 49...a3 white can respond with 50.Nc2 preventing that pawn from promoting.  In which case despite being a pawn down the game might have ended in a draw.  But by playing this black can and will be able to promote and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
545,14,58,4a3,b'4b3/8/8/2p4p/5N2/p5PP/k4K2/8 w - -',With that being said he starts advancing.

547,14,60,Kb3,b'4b3/8/8/2p5/5NP1/pk6/5K2/8 w - -',That's because as noted black can Q.  This is where I start thinking about resigning but will wait until he plays ...a2.
548,14,61,5g5,b'4b3/8/8/2p3P1/5N2/pk6/5K2/8 b - -',With that being said I race and now try to promote or at the least win a piece.  That's because I'm leaving my N there intending to play g6 and if ...Bxg6 that's when I'd take the B.
549,14,62,5a2,b'4b3/8/8/2p3P1/5N2/1k6/p4K2/8 w - -',But once he plays this I resign.  The reason being is that black is going to promote before I'd be able to Q.  As a result he is going to win material and will be able to mate.  Overall I enjoyed this game and Bert said that he enjoyed playing with me again.  But this is what we learned based on what Jack said right after my resignation.  When you're opponent is up a pawn has a passer but both players have a piece it is important to stop that passed pawn with your piece.  Otherwise he or she will promote in which case all hopes are lost.

607,16,2,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',already there are 2 differences from the game CSF annotated. first white placed his knight in front of c2 before playing c4 and i decided to play c6 instead of e6.

646,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Not surprised as like with anyone for her the QPO is very common.  In fact from what I studied this is her main opening.  She does play 1.e4 a lot as anyone would but from what I studied in some of her past games I've seen her open with 1.d4 more.
647,17,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I would've played 1...d5 with that white plays the QG in which case I'd decline it.  But this is just as good.  In fact in a very recent e-mail Susan mentioned about the Colles Opening or Colle-Zukertort system which starts with the QPO.  But will we see this here?
648,17,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',No for this to happen white would've responded with 2.Nf3.  After 2.Nf3 if white plays 3.e3 then it's the Colle's Opening.  However this is unusual but it reminds me of the Owen's Defense.  It's similar to a QG so 1.d4 Nf6  But then comes 2.Nf3 c5  So it's basically a gambit.  In this case it's more similar to a combination because it is a real gambit where white gives up a pawn.  But once black takes he or she benefits.  This is a little different then a reversed Owen's because first there's no sac.  Second there's no sac and Karpov will play 2...e6  Now in the Owen's the e pawn does not advance this early.  On the other hand it's a similar idea as Susan however will play 3.Nf3
649,17,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I am presuming since part of the assignment even if I'm wrong is to try and figure it out.  So I presume that Karpov is thinking along the lines of and is playing this as though it were the French.  Which if so it makes sense because by doing so it would appear that he gets a more comfortable position.
650,17,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',In general however except for circumstances which would be more then what we're used they don't deviate from guidelines whatsoever.  As noted Susan's opponent in this case when he was at the time the champion lost by deviating from the general guidelines.
651,17,5,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Could never figure why that's so as I would've just developed a central pawn and then brought the B out.  But GM's like to fianchetto because the flanks are important.  And white's next move proves that.
652,17,6,Ba6,b'rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is why they fianchetto.  And I used to be surprised by this kind of play but that's no longer the case.  That's because as you saw in recent annotation Bert played this move against me.
653,17,7,b3,b'rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"As noted before GM's like to Fianchetto.  What surprises me even at GM level is that one can fiachetto both sides this soon.  I only saw this once with Charleshiggie in one of my annotations but back then I thought it was unheard of.  Now that I see this I know otherwise.  However I am shocked but at the same time amazed that as jstevens1 would say as per one of her threads at WTWLTR club; and while this is in a different context it's very applicable here.  But ""It Can be Done""."
654,17,8,Bb4+,b'rn1qk2r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/1bPP4/1P3NP1/P3PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I am surprised to see this at GM level.  I have seen it before but with players of my strength or lower including Mariann who I've coached.  But I didn't know that GM's deliver this kind of check so soon.
655,17,9,Bd2,b'rn1qk2r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/1bPP4/1P3NP1/P2BPP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Normally this would make sense as I used to get out this way.  But in this case I'm not sure why this is better then other moves.  The only reason being is that I got criticized for playing this to get out of check.  No it's not bad or what you might think.  When I say criticized I'm not offended in any way.  It just means that as someone told me it was a mistake when I did it.  So I am not sure why she got out this way.  I think that best was 6.Nbd2  While it looks awkward white develops another piece plus the N appears to be better placed as I believe that sooner or later you can find a better outpost because that's why as noted you would generally develop the N to d2 as white.
656,17,10,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/p1ppbppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P2BPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black does not want to exchange.  Therefore we know that it would hurt Karpov's position.  At first I wasn't sure how and likely would've made an inaccuracy with 6...Bxd2?!  But it makes sense though as I know what's really going on and as noted part of the HW is trying to figure it out which I just was able to do.  It would not be good to exchange because Karpov's DSB is stronger then white's DSB so taking would lose a strong B pair and thus put him a slight disadvantage.  By refusing to exchange it still remains in my opinion even as he keeps his stronger bishop pair.  As noted just because things are level doesn't mean it's even.  And even at that if you exchange your stronger B pair for the opponents weaker then you're placed at a disadvantage.
657,17,11,Bg2,b'rn1qk2r/p1ppbppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P2BPPBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I like forming the longest flank which is why I used to fianchetto my B.  But more often then not when I've done this it was at the cost of tempo which I needed.  A perfect example was one of my last games against the one that I don't like anymore but have annotated.  Fianchettoing meant disaster for the same reason that GM elyhim mentioned.  Before this however myevilliuck advised against this but the only reason I didn't continue listening to him was that therealjimfrior said not to use the word avoid because if it works good if not don't play it.  What changed my mind again however is that ION said that fianchettoing costed time and thus to really be careful unless there's no way to get it out.  That was the case against GAC but it still lost time.  Therefore although I won't mark since you don't really know if it's best or not I just based on my negative experiences with fianchettos would call 4.g3 as well as this move extraordinarly brilliant.  And if this weren't with GM's I'd give it two exclamation points.
658,17,12,c6,b'rn1qk2r/p2pbppp/bpp1pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P2BPPBP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Karpov is thinking in a very similar manner to white.  As noted the c pawn like with QG often gets advanced early in the Owen's Defense.  Although it's nothing like it anymore I believe when doing the HW the idea is similar.  Note: It's not a fact since it's beyond our level but this is my personal opinion.
659,17,13,O-O,b'rn1qk2r/p2pbppp/bpp1pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P2BPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I'm not surprised with this move because as with any game K safety is important.  In fact while I already knew this it is something that Susan has illustrated that you have to get your K to safety.  But that's something her sister Judit as well as Carlson and another GM have all emphasized.
660,17,14,d5,b'rn1qk2r/p3bppp/bpp1pn2/3p4/2PP4/1P3NP1/P2BPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq d6',Advancing the other central pawn for development.  And since a GM did this I no longer agree that one should not break open the center before developing because that is exactly what Karpov just did.  Worth noting is that if he didn't play this I'd still agree.  But that is one reason for doing this HW.  It helps one learn more which is also how to become a better chess player.
661,17,15,Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/p3bppp/bpp1pn2/3pN3/2PP4/1P4P1/P2BPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',One could argue that the same piece shouldn't be moved twice.  But this however is an exception because while not now the f7 square is a potential target.  And I bet that this is Susan's plan based on the course planning and strategy and about finding forcing moves which is more then safe to infer that white is looking for this as that's how GM's think.
662,17,16,Nfd7,b'rn1qk2r/p2nbppp/bpp1p3/3pN3/2PP4/1P4P1/P2BPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I would've played 9...Nbd7  But I understand why he moved here.  Once they exchange not only does black develop but his N is in a much better place.  I think it's stronger then N on b8 if he moved that instead.  Also the reason it would be in a better place is due to the fact that on more then one occasion black can find a very good outpost for his N which is an important part of strategy.
663,17,17,1Bc3,b'r2qk2r/p2nbppp/bpp1p3/3p4/2PP4/1PB3P1/P3PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',To put pressure on her long diagonal with her dark square.  In my opinion she bears in mind that 11...dxc4?! is risky because instead of taking right away white has 12.d5 and should Karpov dare take white will at the very least win a R for B after 13.Bxg7 which is why she would make the combination with a pawn.
664,17,18,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p2nbppp/bpp1p3/3p4/2PP4/1PB3P1/P3PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Taking no chances with what I mentioned Karpov gets his K to safety.
665,17,19,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/p2nbppp/bpp1p3/3p4/2PP4/1PB3P1/P2NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Finding a good outpost for her N as this makes as this at the very least enables white to play 13.Nf3 so that it's better placed.  No good of course for the reason we all know about was 12.Na4 because of his DSB.
666,17,20,1f5,b'r2q1rk1/p2nb1pp/bpp1p3/3p1p2/2PP4/1PB3P1/P2NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6',While I generally wouldn't play this like what everyonelse would say in this case it's not a big deal that there is what I consider to be a whole around the K.  Although he doesn't do this I think his plan is to mobilize his f R.  I believe that the real goal (long term plan) is for him to be able to play ...Rh6.
667,17,21,1Rc1,b'r2q1rk1/p2nb1pp/bpp1p3/3p1p2/2PP4/1PB3P1/P2NPPBP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Adding an overload to her DSB.

I know I said that GM's like to attack pieces but as cdeburca once said really strong players don't just play moves to attack pieces.  The big picture as also noted in the intro is why which is the most common chess question.  I'd say that the goal is not the R instead he plays this to put pressure on the c file.  I think the idea being is that putting pressure on a specific file rank or for that matter a square will benefit his or her position.  I'm not sure how but this would make sense nonetheless.
669,17,23,1Rb1,b'r2q1rk1/p2n2pp/bpp1p3/3p1p2/2PP4/bPB3P1/P2NPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',She must defend.  Not as good in my opinion which is the only other option there was 14.Ra1 but then the R appears to be stuck in the corner.  And when that happens the mobility is more limited.  As we know though mobility is vital.
670,17,24,1Bd6,b'r2q1rk1/p2n2pp/bppbp3/3p1p2/2PP4/1PB3P1/P2NPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',I was a little surprised to see this move.  But I think that Karpov didn't want to take any chances with getting into trouble with the DSB.  That's because this is his strong B as the mobility of black's DSB is higher then the mobility of his LSB.
671,17,25,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/p2n2pp/bppbp3/3p1p2/1PPP4/2B3P1/P2NPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',The plan here is a pawn chain but not for the reason you mentioned.  White intends to gain tempo and enclose the center as we're about to see.  As a hint and to an extent a spoiler I followed the same strategy with knightrider62 so it will make sense pretty soon.
672,17,26,1Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/p2n2pp/bppbp3/3p1p2/1PPP4/2B3P1/P2NPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Adding an overload to his c pawn.
673,17,27,1Qb3,b'r1q2rk1/p2n2pp/bppbp3/3p1p2/1PPP4/1QB3P1/P2NPPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',So white adds pressure to the c file.  Normally I wouldn't see the point but it does a lot more then it appears which I was sort of implying a little earlier.  But there is still a little more to the story.  As awkward as might sound the reason I add this is that she has a plan and as we know GM's can think well ahead due to their experience.  Sometimes it's at least 30 moves in advance from what I've been told.
674,17,28,1b5,b'r1q2rk1/p2n2pp/b1pbp3/1p1p1p2/1PPP4/1QB3P1/P2NPPBP/1R3RK1 w - -',Black wants to get rid of the danger so the idea is either force an exchange or win a pawn.
675,17,29,1c5,b'r1q2rk1/p2n2pp/b1pbp3/1pPp1p2/1P1P4/1QB3P1/P2NPPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',But Susan does not have to decide between the two.  And this was all along the plan behind 15.b4 with the pawn chain and 16.Qb3 with the added pressure.  Now not only is the B attacked which wasn't the real goal.  But the question about the attack is what does it do.  The pressure on the d file is greater then one Karpov could imagine.  That's something he was also trying to prevent.  But this pressure loses tempo for black.  And with that I believe that white although no where near winning has a very slight advantage.  The point is that timing's critical.
676,17,30,1e3,b'r1q2rk1/p1bn2pp/b1p1p3/1pPp1p2/1P1P4/1QB1P1P1/P2N1PBP/1R3RK1 b - -',Adding to her pawn chain.
677,17,31,1Qe8,b'r3qrk1/p1bn2pp/b1p1p3/1pPp1p2/1P1P4/1QB1P1P1/P2N1PBP/1R3RK1 w - -',But black has ideas of his own.  I think the reason he played this is that should Karpov be able to put pressure of his own with the N the Q will add to that pressure.  Not now but sometimes you have threats of mate.  That is when the N is on somewhere like g4 and the Q is directly behind it on h5.  I know because although it happened several years ago not only did I have to study this with Jack but I've made mistakes like that including with a game on this website and payed the price.  Although there won't be that danger it is still the same idea that black presumably wants to put pressure on white with his N and Q close to each other.
678,17,32,1f4,b'r3qrk1/p1bn2pp/b1p1p3/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1P1P1/P2N2BP/1R3RK1 b - f3',I believe that the intention is to prevent black from putting pressure on f4.  If that happened white would be in a little trouble and thus would lose that small edge that she currently has.
679,17,33,1h6,b'r3qrk1/p1bn2p1/b1p1p2p/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1P1P1/P2N2BP/1R3RK1 w - -',I believe to open up if white were to play Qc2 with a possible idea of exchanging pawns from the d to f files with the plan being Be4.  It's unlikely but if that were to happen black is now protected.
680,17,34,2Nf3,b'r3qrk1/p1bn2p1/b1p1p2p/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1PNP1/P5BP/1R3RK1 b - -',"Finding a better place for her N as noted on white's 12th which was also a part of her plan.  The reason she couldn't do this sooner is that some of black's plan got in the way of her plan because of what we know with forcing moves.  The idea here is that white had to do something before black could come up with nasty threats which might give him a winning edge.  Don't think that would be true but white just had to be careful to prevent that since the idea is as she also noted what C++ has said which is ""Consider all threats checks and captures."""
681,17,35,2Kh7,b'r3qr2/p1bn2pk/b1p1p2p/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1PNP1/P5BP/1R3RK1 w - -',As of now we're not in an endgame so the K hasn't become a weapon as of the moment.  And there's no major threats yet.  But I think the potential still excists.  Although it's slight why take the chance?  In addition the danger I'm thinking of involves the same threat I mentioned on his last move.  I could be wrong but against GM's even the slightest threats are something to be weary because as noted they can think well in advance.
682,17,36,2Kf2,b'r3qr2/p1bn2pk/b1p1p2p/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1PNP1/P4KBP/1R3R2 b - -',I think the same could be said for white as to why she played this.  It looks like black's idea would be getting rid those pawns from the d to h files so that his threats would potentially be the same after ...Qh5  So the idea would be to eliminate that danger.
683,17,37,2Nf6,b'r3qr2/p1b3pk/b1p1pn1p/1pPp1p2/1P1P1P2/1QB1PNP1/P4KBP/1R3R2 w - -',It appears that my instinct's about black were spot on.  This is also why it's good to do HW.  By doing so you learn which in turn helps one to become a better player.  This is also why mentors give their students HW.  The idea being that their goal is to help you learn and teach which is why their called mentors.  So the way you do is by getting HW assignements that you as the student have to give an answer and try to figure out.  Examples as noted are asking why player A resigned against player B or seeing if you can find the move that will lead to a draw.  Well this makes sense because one can also be his or her mentor.  It's called being your own spectator as the master mater puts it.  At this point I understand because by being your own spectator you spot your mistakes and teach yourself chess which is how you can be your own mentor including but not limited to giving yourself HW.  And since mate is no longer threatened I think that with the same idea he intends to win a pawn and pin the B with the plan being ...Ng4 followed by ...Qh5 vica versa.
684,17,38,2Ne5,b'r3qr2/p1b3pk/b1p1pn1p/1pPpNp2/1P1P1P2/1QB1P1P1/P4KBP/1R3R2 b - -',Not surprisingly however white does not allow it.  In addition the N looks nasty here.

Now one think that doubled pawns are quite nasty but in this position I don't think there of any asset whatsoever.  That is in part because there is now pressure on the f6 square which gains more time.  With that said I think it goes from just minor to white having a noticeable edge at this point.  And what's more interesting is that both sides have been and are still flawless in my opinion.
687,17,41,2Ng4+,b'r3qr2/p5pk/b1p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3Pn1/1QB1P1P1/P4KBP/1R3R2 w - -',Not surprised that he moved here as he now gains some time.  In addition despite a perfect as implied above this move also wins a pawn since it is afterall a fork.  That's why he played this more then the other reason.  The idea is tactics with the plan also being that he found a forcing a move which is how he winds up a pawn.
688,17,42,2Rfh1,b'r3qr2/p5pk/b1p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3P2/1QB1P1P1/P3K1Bn/1R5R b - -',With where the N however is placed now we can say that Susan puts pressure on Karpov.  So despite winning the pawn while she won't win anything back as of the moment it does get tempo in return.  And that's why despite being a disadvantage with the loss it's very slight.  It is so small that it appears pretty much even.
689,17,43,2Bf3,b'r3qr2/p5pk/b1p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3Pn1/1QB1PBP1/P3K3/1R5R b - -',Not at all surprised.  Given how black captured she wants to get rid of his N one way or another.  Since she already knew that black would see the threat this was part of her plan.  That once he played 25...Ng4 this was how she would respond.  So although it was OTB I think it is still nonetheless a conditional move because under the condition that Karpov retreats this was white would do.
690,17,44,2Qg6,b'r4r2/p5pk/b1p1p1qp/1pPpPp2/1P3Pn1/1QB1PBP1/P3K3/1R5R w - -',Not surprisingly with what happened in terms of 24...Nxh2 black will not allow an exchange.  What white had in mind before this move was that ...PXB was allright.  However 27.Bxg4? would be Susan's first mistake because she would lose a pawn due to a nasty fork after 27...Qxg4+
691,17,45,2Rh4,b'r4r2/p5pk/b1p1p1qp/1pPpPp2/1P3PnR/1QB1PBP1/P3K3/1R6 b - -',With how many moves they think it's obvious that Susan anticipated that.  So this was her conditional move as it adds pressure to g4  It's not attacked with the pawn but that's not the point.  The idea is that you now have another offender so while the N is under seige it is nonetheless vulnerable which is what I mean by under pressure.  While I wouldn't think it's also safe to infer that she might be planning on a mating attack as well.  With that R there although it wouldn't happen now the plan would likely be putting the Q on a square like (e.g. the plan might be getting rid of some her pawn's as noted earlier to allow Qf4 and with her R there that would pose as a real threat.)  The threat would involve pressure against the K and thus mate.

Perhaps a Q sac on f5  Note: it wouldn't necessarily be true because of f5 but just as an example you might be talking about an eventual Q sac on f5.  That's one of the things that the Polgar sisters are known for are sacking their Q.  And when they do so it often leads to mate.  If not the position at the very least would be lost for their opponents.
694,17,48,2Qe8,b'r3qrk1/p5p1/b1p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3PnR/2B1PBP1/P1Q1K3/1R6 w - -',As it's safe to infer that Karpov has studied their games he will not allow that which is why black brings an overload to e6.
695,17,49,2Rbh1,b'r3qrk1/p5p1/b1p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3PnR/2B1PBP1/P1Q1K3/7R b - -',So white doubles up because the idea being is that two R's on one file are known to be very dangerous.  
696,17,50,2Bc8,b'r1b1qrk1/p5p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P3PnR/2B1PBP1/P1Q1K3/7R w - -',?? Of course black has other ideas which is why he remobilizes his B and adds yet another defender to e6.   Now on a normal basis I wouldn't mark it as you don't really know if it's an error or not.  But I believe that this is blacks first mistake.  And it appears to be worse then that.  I think that up to this point no one made a single mistake but this however seems to lose the game as we will see later on which is why I give it two queries.  Instead best appeared to be 29...Qg6  After white exchanges which was also part of her Susan is going to win back a pawn.  That's also why she planned that.
697,17,51,Kh8,b'r1b1qr1k/p5p1/2p1p2p/1pPpP3/1P3PR1/2B1P1P1/P1Q1K3/7R w - -',Well white was threatening 32.Rxh6 which would win a pawn this time around as Karpov would not be allowed to take back.  the reason being is that 32...gxh6 would in fact be an illegal move as the g pawn is pinned.  At least for now however this move protects the pawn.  But how long will it last?
698,17,52,3Rg6,b'r1b1qr1k/p5p1/2p1p1Rp/1pPpP3/1P3P2/2B1P1P1/P1Q1K3/7R b - -',In this position white is threatening mate believe it or not.  It would start with a combination by saccing her R.  The idea being 33.Rgxh6+ with mate one or another because if 33...Kg8 34.Qh7+ Kf7 (forced) 35.Qxg7#  And if instead 33...gxh6 34.Rxg6 Kg8 (forced) 35.Qh7#  
699,17,53,3Qf7,b'r1b2r1k/p4qp1/2p1p1Rp/1pPpP3/1P3P2/2B1P1P1/P1Q1K3/7R w - -',But this move however prevents that because if 33.Rgxh6+ gxh6 34.Rxh6+ Kg8 35.Qh7+?? doesn't work.  In fact it would be now be a blunder due to his Q which would at the very least lose a R.  35...Qxh7 36.Rxh7 Kxh7 and black would now have a winning edge.
700,17,54,3g4,b'r1b2r1k/p4qp1/2p1p1Rp/1pPpP3/1P3PP1/2B1P3/P1Q1K3/7R b - -',Having said that white comes with other ideas.  While it would take a very long say at least 10 moves (as per once again how far they can think) the long term plan would be to figure out a way to promote.  And while black doesn't have a passed pawn yet my inference is that this is what she intends to do.
701,17,55,3Kg8,b'r1b2rk1/p4qp1/2p1p1Rp/1pPpP3/1P3PP1/2B1P3/P1Q1K3/7R w - -',So Karpov isn't taking any chances.  But it's now safe to say that this is his first mistake because black is going to lose a pawn at this point with no way around it.
702,17,56,a5,b'r1b2rk1/5qp1/2p1p1RR/ppPpP3/1P3PP1/2B1P3/P1Q1K3/8 w - a6',Seeing how dangerous her b pawn might become due to the DSB guarding it black intends to exchange.  However white will not accept as there are bigger threats to worry about in this position.
703,17,57,3Rg5,b'r1b2rk1/5qp1/2p1p2R/ppPpP1R1/1P3PP1/2B1P3/P1Q1K3/8 b - -',The reason for this move is that the threat of mate is more obvious.  Her Q was effectively blocked by the g6 R  as it could not go to h7.  But by moving it the threat is there and if Karpov isn't careful white will mate.
704,17,58,3axb4,b'r1b2rk1/5qp1/2p1p2R/1pPpP1R1/1p3PP1/2B1P3/P1Q1K3/8 w - -',I would've said that he thought he'd won the pawn back with his idea being 36.Bxb4 36...Rxa2 but I quickly realized that it isn't so because of 37.Qxa2 losing a R.  So why did black play this?  Black thought that he had stopped a potentially dangerous pawn as noted on his last move.  But this loses immediately because Karpov had a much bigger threat that he needed to weary of.  By missing it white will mate immediately.  However it was still lost mate no matter how you look at this.  But black would've lasted a move longer.  If 35...g6 to prevent white from mating on h7.  36.Rxg6+ Qxg6 37.Qxg6+ Kh8 (forced) 37.Rh5#

706,18,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I normally go for 3.e5 straight or else Nd2 unless I want to try an already forgotten Alekhine attack on the king´s side. But it is nice to try new things from time to time especially on blitz games. Not sure what are the lines here though.
707,18,1,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Going for a classic e5 spearhead but without supporting d4 with c3. I know that white can try now h4 at a certain timepoint.
708,18,2,f4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',But also that an alternative to support e5 is this f4 before doing Nf3. Again not sure if this is the strongest line for white here.

720,18,14,Qb6,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1q2b3/3pPpN1/P2P1P2/R7/2P3PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',A fair counterattack. Black can try now if white is passive enough to advance f6 and then Bishop supports the defence and at the same time 6th line is open for the BQ to heal as well.
721,18,15,1Kh1,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1q2b3/3pPpN1/P2P1P2/R7/2P3PP/3Q1R1K b - -',And white seems to play passive as I said. But I want´t sure what else to do since moving the WQ would lead to d4 capture and check.

Probably I had little desire to give White anything so decided to just connect my rooks.

The rest of is army sits idle like most of Richard III's force at the Battle of Bosworth Field; at least there he had treason by his commanders to blame.

Yes you could argue that much of my force has also sat still whilst the battle has raged but they were all exactly where they needed to be. The same cannot be said for White's pieces.

Like I said if he had gotten rolling on the Qside this might have been a more intricate game.

If you must use a hypermodern opening stick to the ones like the Sicilian that still make sense and leave the more esoteric flanking attacks for those mad high raters I say! :S

Anyway that's me done! :)

Sem cometer novos erros as pretas devastaram todas as peças brancas chegando a um final de rei e dama contra rei. Mas o ponteiro das pretas caiu: essa queda de seta em tal posição significou empate. O jogo foi bom até o 13º lance mas a partir desse ponto os dois jogadores erraram muito. O condutor das pretas errou mais porém o erro do condutor das brancas foi mais grave.

Bringing the queen out early allows your opponent to chase her around the board.  He develops his pieces while you move the same one over and over.  If black answers with Pg6 great!  You get a rook.  Or if black plays Nc6 to protect the pawn you might shoot for the four move mate with Bc4.  Black will probably counter that however.  It is better to play conservatively unless you know your opponent is likely to be easy prey."

1081,31,34,g1=Q+,b'8/p4k2/1p6/3pP3/2p5/P1P2pK1/1P6/6q1 w - -',"0-1 Black wins. He didn't have much fight in him after he blundered piece. Although in my next game Jesus Christ showed me that I shouldn't give up just because you are down.

Since I don't have a log for the next game I'll explain it here.
We opened with e4 c5 nc3 nc6 e5.(I'm white.) Just a bit later I won one of his queenside pawns he got one off my kingside. Then I blundered a piece in a trade of minor pieces. Jesus helped me to realize just because I lost a piece I'm not lost. I still have a chance. I just have to play my best and focus. So I launch a queenside attack. He launches a kingside attack a bit later. I had 3 vs 2 pawns on the queenside He had 2 vs 1. He has an extra Bishop we both have rooks and knights. He moves his Bishop diagonally next to his pawn since I threaten it with my Knight and I was also threatening his Bishop. I use a move or two to get my king up there then capture his pawn with my Knight he checks from below with his rook. I noticed his Bishop was hanging so I took it with my king. We discussed after the game  and he realized he should have took the Knight with the Bishop but he said he thought he could do that(check me to gain material)for some reason. I'm up a pawn now. My Knight supports my queening squares on the a and c files. He has advanced his h pawn to the the 2nd rank of mine. I push my a pawn to rank 6. He puts his took next to his pawn on g2. He threatens Rg1. I move Rh1 he moves Rg1. His Knight guards both the h pawn and the rook. I take his pawn. He takes my rook. a7. Ra1. a8Q. Rxa8. Nxa8. My Knight is in the corner his king is somewhere around g7. My pawn is around c3 on the c file I think my king was 1 or 2 squares above. His pawn is on g6. I dash my Knight back to the pawn. I put my Knight in front of it. Move my king to d6. He moves. I move. He moves. In the end I remember he couldn't lure my Knight from protecting g2 even after his Knight and king we're there. C8Q. He still hasn't moved his pawn to g2. At this point I remember the board clearly again. My king d6 queen c8 Knight h4 his Knight e3 king f3 pawn g3. Trying to find a move... I find Qc6+. He grabs his king. Hovers it over f4 and g4. He chooses g4. I move Ng2. He captures. I capture. Kh4 to protect the pawn. I move my king over and he resigned within a few moves."
1082,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is a fun game where we both queen a pawn and end up with 4 queens on the board. It is also a bit of a mystery. I lose but the post-game computer analysis (PMCA) doesn't highlight any mistakes by me. So where did a go wrong? Read through with me dear reader and see if you can help me find out where I went wrong!
1083,32,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So it starts conventionally.
1084,32,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I continue with the most popular move.
1085,32,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is very sound indicating perhaps a Nimzo-Indian Defence or a Queen's Indian Defence.
1086,32,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I elect for a Nimzo-Indian.
1087,32,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Which she obliges with rather than transpose back to the Queens Gambit declined with d7-d5.
1088,32,6,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the main line.
1089,32,7,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the more modern move previously 0-0 was usually played here.
1090,32,8,Nge2,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So one knight supports the other. I stop her doubling my pawns. This is the Fischer variation named after the only American World Chess Champion.
1091,32,9,c5,b'rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',She hits my centre.
1092,32,10,a3,b'rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/1bPP4/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the obvious follow up to Nge2 now that she can't double my pawns.
1093,32,11,Ba5,b'rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So the Bishop retreats.
1094,32,12,g3,b'rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As my bishop can't go to e2 or d3 I plan to develop it on g2.
1095,32,13,Bb7,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',But this stops my plan!
1096,32,14,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1pP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is virtually the only move. If she now takes on d5 I don't take back immediately as she can just take on d5 as my Nc3 is not really protecting d5 as it is pinned against my king. Instead I would have played Bg2 first before taking back on d5.
1097,32,15,b5,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/bppP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So she doesn't take but further undermines my centre.
1098,32,16,Bg2,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/bppP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I need to develop and protect d5.
1099,32,17,bxc4,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',And now my talented young opponent is a pawn up but it is debatable whether or not she can hang on to it.
1100,32,18,1O-O,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I just castle.
1101,32,19,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And so does she.
1102,32,20,1e4,b'rn1q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I further re-enforce d5.
1103,32,21,1h6,b'rn1q1rk1/pb1p1pp1/4pn1p/b1pP4/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And she prevents an unpleasant pin on her knight with Bc1-g5. Up to here we are following moves in the Gameknot Opening Databases but h6 appears to be a new move. maybe a reader with a bigger opening database can confirm or refute this?
1104,32,22,1Rb1,b'rn1q1rk1/pb1p1pp1/4pn1p/b1pP4/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',Now if she takes on c3 I can also take back with the pawn and my rook will have a lovely open file.
1105,32,23,1Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/4pn1p/b1pP4/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',She also mobilises a rook.
1106,32,24,1d6,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3Ppn1p/b1p5/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',I prevent her from supporting the c5 pawn with d7-d6 which is a good thing from my point of view. The disadvantage of this move is that it allows her to develop her Nb8 to c6.
1107,32,25,1e5,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P1n1p/b1p1p3/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P2NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',I have to be very careful now. If I am not careful she will play Nb8-c6-d4 with an overwhelming position.
1108,32,26,1Be3,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P1n1p/b1p1p3/2p1P3/P1N1B1P1/1P2NPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',So I hit c5
1109,32,27,1Bb6,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P1n1p/2p1p3/2p1P3/P1N1B1P1/1P2NPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',She protects it.
1110,32,28,1f4,b'rn1qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P1n1p/2p1p3/2p1PP2/P1N1B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 b - f3',Again hitting one of the pawns which would support that knight if it ever got to d4.
1111,32,29,1Nc6,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1bnP1n1p/2p1p3/2p1PP2/P1N1B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',But the knight comes out anyway.
1112,32,30,1fxe5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1bnP1n1p/2p1P3/2p1P3/P1N1B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',So I take!
1113,32,31,1Ng4,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1bnP3p/2p1P3/2p1P1n1/P1N1B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',She attacks my bishop
1114,32,32,1Nd5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1bnP3p/2pNP3/2p1P1n1/P3B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',I protect with my knight.
1115,32,33,1Ncxe5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pNn3/2p1P1n1/P3B1P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',She recaptures the pawn.
1116,32,34,1Bf4,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pNn3/2p1PBn1/P5P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',In this open position probably the bishops are better than the knights.
1117,32,35,1Nd3,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pN4/2p1PBn1/P2n2P1/1P2N1BP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',But this knight floats deep into my position.
1118,32,36,1Nec3,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pN4/2p1PBn1/P1Nn2P1/1P4BP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',I re-enforce my knight on d5 with my other knight.
1119,32,37,1Nge5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pNn3/2p1PB2/P1Nn2P1/1P4BP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',and she re-enforces the knight on d3 with her knight! Both sides' knights protecting each other in the centre of the board next to each other like this make an unusual configuration
1120,32,38,2Qh5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/1b1P3p/2pNn2Q/2p1PB2/P1Nn2P1/1P4BP/1R3RK1 b - -',So I decide to probe the king side.
1121,32,39,2Ba5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/b1pNn2Q/2p1PB2/P1Nn2P1/1P4BP/1R3RK1 w - -',Possibly she is going to start swapping her bishops for my knights?
1122,32,40,2Bxe5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/b1pNB2Q/2p1P3/P1Nn2P1/1P4BP/1R3RK1 b - -',OK stop! Black has two ways of recapturing on e5 - knight or rook. Which is best and why?
1123,32,41,2Nxe5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/b1pNn2Q/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P4BP/1R3RK1 w - -',This way of course - she has to protect f7.
1124,32,42,2Rf5,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/b1pNnR1Q/2p1P3/P1N3P1/1P4BP/1R4K1 b - -',So I hit e5 again.
1125,32,43,2Bxc3,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/2pNnR1Q/2p1P3/P1b3P1/1P4BP/1R4K1 w - -',Nicely timed by my lovely opponent! If I take e5 she can now recapture with the bishop. So I have to recapture the bishop.
1126,32,44,2bxc3,b'r2qr1k1/pb1p1pp1/3P3p/2pNnR1Q/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/1R4K1 b - -',I'd love to say that I foresaw this when I played 12. Rb1 - but quite honestly I would be lying!
1127,32,45,2Bxd5,b'r2qr1k1/p2p1pp1/3P3p/2pbnR1Q/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/1R4K1 w - -',And now she removes the other half of my cavalry. My last move had discovered an attack on her bishop.
1128,32,46,2Rxe5,b'r2qr1k1/p2p1pp1/3P3p/2pbR2Q/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/1R4K1 b - -',Rather than take back and double my pawns I decide to get rid of her strong knight.
1129,32,47,2Rxe5,b'r2q2k1/p2p1pp1/3P3p/2pbr2Q/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/1R4K1 w - -',She takes my rook.

1136,32,54,2Qb4,b'1q4k1/p2p1pp1/3Pb2p/8/1Qp1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/6K1 b - -',I offer the exchange of queens. We now have a very level looking ending. Indeed PMCA gives this position as level. How she manages to turn this position into a winning position with just a few moves is almost a work of black magic! Where on earth did I go wrong?
1137,32,55,2Qd8,b'3q2k1/p2p1pp1/3Pb2p/8/1Qp1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/6K1 w - -',She avoids the queen exchange.
1138,32,56,2Qb5,b'3q2k1/p2p1pp1/3Pb2p/1Q6/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/6K1 b - -',I advance my queen.

I thought on c5 my queen could protect my weaknesses better.  Maybe just dropping it back to b4 was better. What do you think dear reader?

1140,32,58,3Qc5,b'3q2k1/3p1pp1/p2Pb2p/2Q5/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/6K1 b - -',So I went to c5
1141,32,59,3Qb8,b'1q4k1/3p1pp1/p2Pb2p/2Q5/2p1P3/P1P3P1/6BP/6K1 w - -',She takes control of the b file.
1142,32,60,3h3,b'1q4k1/3p1pp1/p2Pb2p/2Q5/2p1P3/P1P3PP/6B1/6K1 b - -',I give my king a flight square.

1146,32,64,3Qa5,b'6k1/3p1pp1/p2Pb2p/Q7/2p1P3/P1P3PP/2q3BK/8 b - -',So I protect c3

1148,32,66,3Qxa6,b'6k1/3p1pp1/Q2Pb2p/8/2p1P3/P1P3PP/3q2BK/8 b - -',So I take and protect it.
1149,32,67,3Qxc3,b'6k1/3p1pp1/Q2Pb2p/8/2p1P3/P1q3PP/6BK/8 w - -',But she takes too.

I like playing the caro kann because it is really solid and actually affords black a lot of aggressive attacking positions (contrary to popular belief).  Normally when I see some try to play anything but the actual main lines I generally assume they aren't very prepared to face the CK!
1179,33,1,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4p3/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',All too happy to exchange the pawn and get my knight out with tempo.

1184,33,6,Kh1,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQ1R1K b kq -',Probably because he didn't want to see any checks on the g1-a7 diagonal.

1344,39,15,1Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 w - -',! This is quite annoying... I can't play 13.Bh6 here due to 13...Nc4.
1345,39,16,1Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 b - -',I played this so that 13...Nc4 does not force a trade of pieces. 13.b3 would be dangerous due to the bishop on g7 looking at my rook on a1.
1346,39,17,1Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black pressurizes my b pawn and threatens to play Nc4 once again.
1347,39,18,1Rab1,b'1rbq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',I move my rook out of the a1-h8 diagonal in order to support my endangered b pawn.
1348,39,19,1b3,b'1r1q1rk1/p2b1pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',!? This is a bit risky as Black may push his pawn to c4 and blow open my position if I misplay later on.
1349,39,20,1Qa5,b'1r3rk1/p2b1pbp/p2p2p1/q1pPn3/4PB2/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Pressurizing my queeside even more and pinning one of my knight to my queen. However nothing is really threatened yet.
1350,39,21,1Bh6,b'1r3rk1/p2b1pbp/p2p2pB/q1pPn3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Finally!
1351,39,22,1Bb5,b'1r3rk1/p4pbp/p2p2pB/qbpPn3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',! The threat here is 16...Bxe2 17.Nxe2 Qxd2 18.Bxd2 leaving all my pieces back in my base whilst Black's would be well positioned to attack me. This also pins my second knight to my rook.
1352,39,23,1Bxg7,b'1r3rk1/p4pBp/p2p2p1/qbpPn3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',!
1353,39,24,1Kxg7,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/qbpPn3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',! Black plays the correct move. 17...Bxe2? would have lead to 18.Bxe5 dxe5 (Forced as White was threatening 19.Bf6 followed by Qh6 and Qg7#.) 19.Qxe2 or Rfc1 and white gets a monster passed pawn.
1354,39,25,1Rfd1,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/qbpPn3/4P3/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Now that my bishop does not cover my queen anymore I had to parry the threat of Bxe2.
1355,39,26,1Bd3,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q1pPn3/4P3/1PNb1P2/P2QN1PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',! Black puts a huge thorn in my side of the field.
1356,39,27,1Rb2,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q1pPn3/4P3/1PNb1P2/PR1QN1PP/3R2K1 b - -',I move my rook out of danger. I'm not quite sure why I didn't play 19.f4 here as 19...Bxe2 20.Nxe2 Qxd2 21.Rxd2 Nc4 doesn't seem horrible for white.
1357,39,28,1c4,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q2Pn3/2p1P3/1PNb1P2/PR1QN1PP/3R2K1 w - -',! Black bolsters his pesky outpost on d3. I cannot take the pawn on c4 due to 20...Nxc4 21.Qxd3 Nxb2 22.Qd4+ Kg8 and Black gets a rook for his bishop.
1358,39,29,2Nf4,b'1r3r2/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q2Pn3/2p1PN2/1PNb1P2/PR1Q2PP/3R2K1 b - -',I move my knight to threaten the bishop and hopefully shoo away Black's forces away. If I can hold on the position I'd have a better pawn structure in the finale!
1359,39,30,2Rfc8,b'1rr5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q2Pn3/2p1PN2/1PNb1P2/PR1Q2PP/3R2K1 w - -',! Black springs the last of his pieces into the action placing his rook on the maybe soon to be opened c file bearing down on my knight. I can't really play 21.Nxd3 here due to 21...Nxd3 22.Rb1 or Rc2 cxb3 and then it gets bad for me.
1360,39,31,2bxc4,b'1rr5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q2Pn3/2P1PN2/2Nb1P2/PR1Q2PP/3R2K1 b - -',!! Yes I declared this move as bad like 1 turn before. However 21...Nxc4 is now met by 22.Rxb8! Nxd2 (22...Rxb8 23.Qxd3 and white is very fine)  23.Rxc8 (Protecting c3!) Bc4! and the position is very unclear.
1361,39,32,2Qxb2,b'2r5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/q2Pn3/2P1PN2/2Nb1P2/PQ4PP/3R2K1 b - -',Rook trade. My queen is sneakily lining up to his king too!
1362,39,33,2Kxf2,b'2r5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/3Pn3/2P1PN2/2Nb1P2/P4KPP/3R4 b - -',Queen trade. I felt that the trades advantaged me more than my opponent. My king is closer to the centre too!
1363,39,34,2Bxc4,b'2r5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/3Pn3/2b1PN2/2N2P2/P4KPP/3R4 w - -',Black regains his pawn. The material is now equal. However my pawn structure is stronger than my opponent's.
1364,39,35,2Rd2,b'2r5/p4pkp/p2p2p1/3Pn3/2b1PN2/2N2P2/P2R1KPP/8 b - -',! I place my rook in my second rank. Black was threatening 25...Bxa2! 26.Nxa2 Rc2+ forking my king and bishop. On a side note Black does not have any good discovered attack on my knight right now.
1365,39,36,2h4,b'1r6/p4pkp/p2p2p1/3Pn3/2b1PN1P/2N2P2/P2R1KP1/8 b - h3',I ensure that Black does not play g5 to poke my knight out of f4 in order to land a piece on d3. Black does not have any entry squares available on my side of the field!
1366,39,37,2Nfe2,b'1r6/p4pk1/p2p2p1/3Pn2p/2b1P2P/2N2P2/P2RNKP1/8 b - -',I decided to move my knight away anyway. Black's plan to play Nd6+ Nb4 a5 a4 a3 Nxa2 Rb2 takes so many turns I have the time to redeploy some of my pieces!
1367,39,38,2a5,b'1r6/p4pk1/3p2p1/p2Pn2p/2b1P2P/2N2P2/P2RNKP1/8 w - -',As expected Black tries to break through the a file.
1368,39,39,Nd3+,b'1r6/p4pk1/3p2p1/p2P3p/2bNP2P/2Nn1P2/P2R1KP1/8 w - -',Black's first major mistake. His plan is just too slow to be effective. Better would have been to bring the king closer I think. To be fair he was in time trouble at that point in the game. Bot players get an extra 45 minutes after the 30eth move.
1369,39,40,2Ke3,b'1r6/p4pk1/3p2p1/p2P3p/2bNP2P/2NnKP2/P2R2P1/8 b - -',I threaten to trade my rook for Black's minor pieces here. 29...Rb2 30.Rxb2 Nxb2 31.Ndb5 Bxb5 32.Nxb5 Nc4+ 33.Kd4 and Black's d pawn is a goner.
1370,39,41,3Nc6,b'1r6/p4pk1/2Np2p1/p2P3p/1nb1P2P/2N1KP2/P2R2P1/8 b - -',! I fork both of Black's a pawn and his rook! He also can't trade knights here as 30...Nxc6 31.dxc6 and white's passed pawn is extremely dangerous.
1371,39,42,3Nxa5,b'8/p4pk1/1r1p2p1/N2P3p/1nb1P2P/2N1KP2/P2R2P1/8 b - -',I take out Black's advanced pawn while also hitting on his bishop.
1372,39,43,3Bb5,b'8/p4pk1/1r1p2p1/Nb1P3p/1n2P2P/2N1KP2/P2R2P1/8 w - -',Black's pieces are badly coordinated and have only a few safe squares available.
1373,39,44,Rxb5,b'8/p4pk1/3p2p1/Nr1P3p/1n2P2P/4KP2/P2R2P1/8 w - -',Knight vs Bishop trade.
1374,39,45,3Nc4,b'8/p4pk1/3p2p1/1r1P3p/1nN1P2P/4KP2/P2R2P1/8 b - -',! Black cannot defend his d pawn.
1375,39,46,3Kf8,b'5k2/p4p2/3p2p1/1r1P3p/1nN1P2P/4KP2/P2R2P1/8 w - -',He finally brings his king closer to the battlefield though f6 might have been a better square to do so.
1376,39,47,Ra5,b'5k2/p4p2/3N2p1/r2P3p/1n2P2P/4KP2/P2R2P1/8 w - -',Now it is I that cannot save my pawn.
1377,39,48,3Rb2,b'5k2/p4p2/3N2p1/r2P3p/1n2P2P/4KP2/PR4P1/8 b - -',! Well if black wants to take my pawn he'll have to do so with his knight! Which puts it a little away from the action. Also...
1378,39,49,3Rb7,b'5k2/pR3p2/3N2p1/r2P3p/4P2P/4KP2/n5P1/8 b - -',! Counterstrike! Black is in serious trouble now.
1379,39,50,3f5,b'5k2/pR6/3N2p1/r2P1p1p/4P2P/4KP2/n5P1/8 w - f6',This allows black to trade the pawn instead of simply losing it. 37.exf5 would cause some issues after 37...Rxd5.
1380,39,51,3Kd4,b'5k2/pR6/3N2p1/r2P1p1p/3KP2P/5P2/n5P1/8 b - -',! I'm bringing my king closer to stop Black's a pawn... Or am I? (Side note: I'm also preventing Nc3)
1381,39,52,3fxe4,b'5k2/pR6/3N2p1/r2P3p/3KP2P/8/n5P1/8 b - -',I need to secure d5 to keep blocking Black's pieces off his king.
1382,39,53,3Ra4+,b'5k2/pR6/3N2p1/3P3p/r2KP2P/8/n5P1/8 w - -',A spite check accomplishing nothing.
1383,39,54,3Ke5,b'5k2/pR6/3N2p1/3PK2p/r3P2P/8/n5P1/8 b - -',Getting closer...
1384,39,55,4Kf6,b'5k2/pR6/3N1Kp1/3P3p/rn2P2P/8/6P1/8 b - -',GETTING CLOSER...
1385,39,56,4Ra6,b'5k2/pR6/r2N1Kp1/3P3p/1n2P2P/8/6P1/8 w - -',Black is busted no matter what. 40...Kg7 41.Kxg6 Kf8 42.Kh7 and 43.Rf7#
1386,39,57,4Rb8#,b'1R3k2/p7/r2N1Kp1/3P3p/1n2P2P/8/6P1/8 b - -',And that's game. Overall It was a pretty solid game from both players where I took a risk early on (trading on a6) that ended up paying its dividends later on after a long sequence of precise defense.
