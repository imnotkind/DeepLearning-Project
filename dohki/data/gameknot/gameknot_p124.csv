0,0,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',An unusual opening move but the game soon transposes to a Caro-Kann. 
1,0,1,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the opening Kasparov played against Deep Blue in the last game of their match. However this game deviates from that one with the next move.
2,0,2,Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Each side has been carrying out development for the last few moves.
3,0,3,b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1pp1pn2/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',I wanted to fianchetto my light square bishop and then play c5 to open up the diagonal for it.
4,0,4,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2pn2/2pP2B1/2P5/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R b - -',White threatens to block off my bishop so I feel I need to exchange this annoying pawn off.
5,0,5,1cxd5,b'r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p3n2/2pP2B1/8/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R b - -',White is again blocking my bishop.
6,0,6,1Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p6/2pn2B1/8/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R w - -',Unfortunately this move allows white to mount an attack upon my king.
7,0,7,1Bxh7+,b'r2q1rk1/p2nbppB/1p6/2pb2B1/8/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R b - -',This move reveals an attack on my light square bishop.
8,0,8,1Nxg5+,b'r2q1r2/p2n1ppk/1p6/2pQ2N1/8/8/PP3PPP/2KR3R b - -',Material is even but my king is under attack.
9,0,9,1Qf5,b'r2q1rk1/p2n1pp1/1p6/2p2QN1/8/8/PP3PPP/2KR3R b - -',Threatening Qh7#.
10,0,10,1g6,b'r2q1rk1/p2n1p2/1p4p1/2p2QN1/8/8/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',Blocking the path to h7.
11,0,11,1Qg4,b'r2q1rk1/p2n1p2/1p4p1/2p3N1/6Q1/8/PP3PPP/2KR3R b - -',I thought that here white might have been thinking to attack along the h file. 
12,0,12,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/p4p2/1p3np1/2p3N1/6Q1/8/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',So I played this move to defend that area and offer a trade of queens (thereby slowing down white's attack).
13,0,13,2Rxd8,b'r2R1rk1/p4p2/1p3np1/2p3N1/6Q1/8/PP3PPP/2K4R b - -',White throws away the attack and the position becomes even again. Houdini 1.5a shows how the attack could have been conducted: 20.Qf3 Nd7  21.Ne4 f5  22.Qg3 Qe8  23.Ng5 Nf6  24.Re1 Qb5  25.Ne6 Qc4+  26.Kb1 Qg4  27.Qxg4 fxg4 28. Nxf8 and white wins a rook losing a knight.
14,0,14,Rxf8,b'5rk1/p4p2/1p4p1/2p3N1/6n1/8/PP3PPP/2K4R w - -',With the exchange of material my king feels much safer.
15,0,15,Nf6,b'5rk1/p4p2/1p3np1/2p3N1/8/5P2/PP4PP/2K4R w - -',Probably retreating to f2 would have been better.
16,0,16,Re8,b'4r1k1/p4p2/1p3np1/2p3N1/8/5P2/PP4PP/2K1R3 w - -',This prevents intrusion of the  7th rank.
17,0,17,Rd5,b'6k1/p4p2/1p3np1/2pr4/8/5P1N/PP4PP/2KR4 w - -',I probably could have accomplished more with other moves but I wanted to keep trading in order to make things simpler.
18,0,18,2Kd2,b'8/p4pk1/1p3np1/2p5/5N2/5P2/PP1K2PP/8 b - -',Each side begins to bring their king in to the center.
19,0,19,f4,b'8/8/1p3k2/p1pn2p1/5p2/PP1N1PPP/3K4/8 w - -',Each side has been mostly advancing pawns.
20,0,20,3g4,b'8/8/1p3k2/p1pn2p1/5pP1/PP1N1P1P/3K4/8 b - -',Now white has a backward pawn on h3. Perhaps gxf4 would have been better.
21,0,21,3Ne3,b'8/8/1p3k2/p1p3p1/5pP1/PP1NnP1P/3K4/8 w - -',My knight is heading for h4 where it will attack the pawn on f3.
22,0,22,3Kc3,b'8/8/1p3k2/p1p3p1/5pP1/PPKNnP1P/8/8 b - -',In the meanwhile white heads over to attack my queenside pawns.
23,0,23,3Ne1,b'8/8/1p3k2/p1p3p1/2K2pPn/PP3P1P/8/4N3 b - -',Now white's knight is pinned down.
24,0,24,3Kb5,b'8/8/1p6/pKp1k1p1/5pPn/PP3P1P/8/4N3 b - -',A mistake. Houdini 1.5a recommends a4. Now black's king could come down and take the knight.
25,0,25,Kxb3,b'8/8/8/K1p3p1/5pPn/Pk3P1P/8/4N3 w - -',Here black could have played Kd2 instead taking white's knight on the next move. However the ending would have been difficult to play well with each side having a queen.
26,0,26,4a4,b'8/8/8/K1p3p1/P4pPn/1k3P1P/8/4N3 b - -',This position is perfectly equal according to Houdini 1.5a. This game probably should have been drawn. 
27,0,27,Nxf3,b'8/8/8/PK4p1/5pP1/1kp2n1P/8/4N3 w - -',If white takes the knight the c pawn can advance or so it seems. Actually taking the knight probably would have lead to a draw.
28,0,28,4Nd3,b'8/8/8/PK4p1/5pP1/1kpN1n1P/8/8 b - -',This move lost white the game. If 44.Nxf3 c2  45.Nd4+ Kc3  46.Nxc2 Kxc2  47.a6 f2  48.a8Q f1Q+ and the game is a draw as black's queen can keep checking white's king.
29,0,29,4Kb6,b'8/8/1K6/P5p1/3n1pP1/1kpN3P/8/8 b - -',Another big mistake; Kc5 would have been better. However black should still have won (though it would have taken much longer).
30,0,30,4Kc4,b'8/8/1K6/P5p1/2kn1pP1/2pN3P/8/8 w - -',Now black's king can box out white's king.
31,0,31,4Nc1,b'8/8/1K6/P5p1/2kn1pP1/2p4P/8/2N5 b - -',Ne5+ would have prolonged things.
32,0,32,Nb5,b'8/8/PK6/1n4p1/2k3P1/2p2p1P/8/2N5 w - -',Trying to stop white's pawn.
33,0,33,c2,b'8/8/PK6/1n4p1/2k3P1/3N1p1P/2p5/8 w - -',Taking the knight would also have won.
34,0,34,5Ne5+,b'8/8/PK6/1n2N1p1/2k3P1/5p1P/2p5/8 b - -',White has been harassing my king with his knight. I realize the game will end in a draw by repetition unless I step away from my knight.
35,0,35,5Kd5,b'8/8/PK6/1n1kN1p1/6P1/5p1P/2p5/8 w - -',Now the knights leave the board.
36,0,36,Kxe5,b'8/8/P7/1K2k1p1/6P1/5p1P/2p5/8 w - -',It is now mate in 10 (with white getting mated) with optimal play from both sides.
37,0,37,f2,b'8/P7/8/1K2k1p1/6P1/7P/2p2p2/8 w - -',"White resigns as either black will promote first (if white plays something like Kb6) or black will promote with check on f1. Either way white never gets a queen that can be used. It is checkmate in 9 with optimal play from both sides. Thanks for reading!

(This was classified as a ""rapid"" game on Gameknot so it was a bit slower than blitz)."
38,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I usally do the king's pawn but I wanted to do something diffrent.
39,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',!? I have never faced this before.
40,1,2,dxc5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So I try to accept it unsure what is going to happen next.
41,1,3,Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q1P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I see. An opening trap. But the queen is out early.
42,1,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q1P5/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Maybe a little too early.
43,1,5,Qd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2qQ4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I didn't think of this first but it seems Ok.
44,1,6,d6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2qQ4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',?! Strange.
45,1,7,Be3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2qQ4/8/2N1B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Attacking the queen again. 
46,1,8,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/3q4/8/2N1B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black does an exchange of queens very early. Once again mabye a little too early.
47,1,9,Nxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/3N4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',THreatening a fork on c7.
48,1,10,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/3N4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black falls into the trap. Barley noticed that was going to happen.
49,1,11,Nc7+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppN1pppp/3p1n2/8/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Any person would've noticed this fork so it is surprising that my opponent did not.
50,1,12,Nxa8,b'Nnbk1b1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ -',I won't be able to get my knight out now.
51,1,13,Nd5,b'Nnbk1b1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3n4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Just as I expected.
52,1,14,Bxa7,b'Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/3n4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ -',Black didn't notice that.
53,1,15,Nb4,b'Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',It's the Nifty Nxc2+ he's aiming at now. He thinks he can pay me back after the Nc7+ and Nxa8. But I'm not falling for it.
54,1,16,1O-O-O,b'Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR b - -',Now O-O-O might seem plain but it creates a pin on the d-file.
55,1,17,1Nb8c6,b'N1bk1b1r/Bp2pppp/2np4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Now black is starting to think but not after my next bit.
56,1,18,1Bc5,b'N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/2np4/2B5/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR b - -',Ooops! I made a mistake here. The missing key was Nxa2+ and I think he would make that next move.
57,1,19,1Nxa2+,b'N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/2np4/2B5/8/8/nPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Yes for sure.
58,1,20,1Kb1,b'N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/2np4/2B5/8/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR b - -',Now the knight is stuck but never mind.
59,1,21,1Ncb4,b'N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/3p4/2B5/1n6/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR w - -',A dogey move.
60,1,22,1Bb6+,b'N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/1B1p4/8/1n6/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR b - -',I like playing checks.
61,1,23,1Kd7,b'N1b2b1r/1p1kpppp/1B1p4/8/1n6/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR w - -',A standard square. And oh I wish my white-squared bishop was out.
62,1,24,1Nc7,b'2b2b1r/1pNkpppp/1B1p4/8/1n6/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR b - -',Getting my knight out.
63,1,25,1e5,b'2b2b1r/1pNk1ppp/1B1p4/4p3/1n6/8/nPP1PPPP/1K1R1BNR w - e6',!? I don't see the point.
64,1,26,1e4,b'2b2b1r/1pNk1ppp/1B1p4/4p3/1n2P3/8/nPP2PPP/1K1R1BNR b - e3',e4 was simply perfect if black would let me play my next move. Also makes Nf3 more intresting and normal.
65,1,27,1f6,b'2b2b1r/1pNk2pp/1B1p1p2/4p3/1n2P3/8/nPP2PPP/1K1R1BNR w - -',Now that's a pretty fine move but it doesn't stop my next move.
66,1,28,1Bb5+,b'2b2b1r/1pNk2pp/1B1p1p2/1B2p3/1n2P3/8/nPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b - -',Great. Now hopefully I will be able to mate with 3 minor pieces working together just like Legall's Mate.
67,1,29,1c3,b'2b2b1r/1pN1k1pp/1B1p1p2/1B2p3/1n2P3/2P5/nP3PPP/1K1R2NR b - -',The knight's stuck and the threat is cxb4 Kxa2 or Nd5+
68,1,30,1Nc6,b'2b2b1r/1pN1k1pp/1Bnp1p2/1B2p3/4P3/2P5/nP3PPP/1K1R2NR w - -',Now I can do what I planned.
69,1,31,1Nd5+,b'2b2b1r/1p2k1pp/1Bnp1p2/1B1Np3/4P3/2P5/nP3PPP/1K1R2NR b - -',Here comes the dogey check.
70,1,32,1Bc4,b'2b2b1r/1p4pp/1Bnpkp2/3Np3/2B1P3/2P5/nP3PPP/1K1R2NR b - -',Here is a double threat and a fork.
71,1,33,1Nxc3+,b'2b2b1r/1p4pp/1Bnpkp2/3Np3/2B1P3/2n5/1P3PPP/1K1R2NR w - -',Now I can make a check followed by a check.
72,1,34,2Nxc3+,b'2b2b1r/1p4pp/1Bnpkp2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/1P3PPP/1K1R2NR b - -',Amazing.
73,1,35,2Nf3,b'2b2b1r/1p1k2pp/1Bnp1p2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/1K1R3R b - -',I add one more piece.

75,1,37,2Rxd5+,b'2b2b1r/1p1k2pp/1Bn2p2/3Rp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',I ought to do it with my rook.And Check.
76,1,38,2Bd6,b'2b4r/1p1k2pp/1Bnb1p2/3Rp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Forced. But Nb5 wins.
77,1,39,2Nb5,b'2b4r/1p1k2pp/1Bnb1p2/1N1Rp3/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Exactly.
78,1,40,2Ke7,b'2b4r/1p2k1pp/1Bnb1p2/1N1Rp3/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',The first thing to do is if a piece is pinned (for example the bishop on d6) and there are 2 pieces controlling it (like the rook and the knight) and the oppisite side only has 1 ( the king) usally the target has best to run (like to e7).
79,1,41,2Nxd6,b'2b4r/1p2k1pp/1BnN1p2/3Rp3/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Now I am 11 points up but Be6 saves the game for a bit.
80,1,42,2Be6,b'7r/1p2k1pp/1BnNbp2/3Rp3/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',I cannot help that to happen. And there is no defence.
81,1,43,2Nf5+,b'7r/1p2k1pp/1Bn1bp2/3RpN2/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Or maybe there is a little brain could work out some clever exuses. 
82,1,44,2Kf7,b'7r/1p3kpp/1Bn1bp2/3RpN2/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',A very bad sqaure.
83,1,45,2Rd7+,b'7r/1p1R1kpp/1Bn1bp2/4pN2/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Now the bishop on e6 is pinned so it cannot take my rook. Whichever way black escapes from check I will capture next move with Bxe6.
84,1,46,2Ke8,b'4k2r/1p1R2pp/1Bn1bp2/4pN2/2B1P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Bxe6 protects my rook.
85,1,47,2Bxe6,b'4k2r/1p1R2pp/1Bn1Bp2/4pN2/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',I have now got 3 minor pieces and 1 majoir pieces working together but I've got 1 minor and major piece snozzling in the cornes. But never mind. Black has to deal with the Rd8*.
86,1,48,2g6,b'4k2r/1p1R3p/1Bn1Bpp1/4pN2/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Uh-oh that spoils my plan for a bit. But it does allow something else.
87,1,49,2Ng7+,b'4k2r/1p1R2Np/1Bn1Bpp1/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',I think that's proper.
88,1,50,2Kf8,b'5k1r/1p1R2Np/1Bn1Bpp1/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Forced. But there comes another sparkling spectacular mate...
89,1,51,2Bc5+,b'5k1r/1p1R2Np/2n1Bpp1/2B1p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Bc5...which coudl've been mate without that knight on c6 but that makes no diffrence
90,1,52,3Bxe7+,b'5k1r/1p1RB1Np/4Bpp1/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',A wonderful check using a rook a knight and two bishops.
91,1,53,3Kxg7,b'7r/1p1RB1kp/4Bpp1/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Planning a discovered check.

93,1,55,3Kh6,b'3B3r/1p1R3p/4Bppk/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',He had a choice there. E8 or H6.
94,1,56,3Bxf6,b'7r/1p1R3p/4BBpk/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',The two bishops look very strong.
95,1,57,3Rc8,b'2r5/1p1R3p/4BBpk/4p3/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Are you sure that is a good square?
96,1,58,3Bg5+,b'2r5/1p1R3p/4B1pk/4p1B1/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R b - -',Aha. Here comes the mate in 2. A fine bishop check.
97,1,59,3Kh5,b'2r5/1p1R3p/4B1p1/4p1Bk/4P3/5N2/1P3PPP/1K5R w - -',Forced. Shame g5 was blocked.
98,1,60,3g4#,b'2r5/1p1R3p/4B1p1/4p1Bk/4P1P1/5N2/1P3P1P/1K5R b - g3',A very high-standard mate by 2 bishops a knight and a pawn.

101,2,2,1d4,b'1rb2rk1/2p2ppp/2nb4/1p1qp3/3P4/1P2PN2/1B2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - d3',"I've got that open a-file but nowhere really to put the rook. I'm worried about him playing Nb4 eventually and his queen is making it hard on my queen because of the pawn on b3.
d4 is a theme in this opening so let's see if it helps out."
102,2,3,Ne7,b'1rb2rk1/2p1nppp/3b4/1p1qN3/3Pp3/1P2P3/1B2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I'm worried about him playing f6 to trap the knight.
103,2,4,1Ra5,b'1rb2rk1/2p1nppp/3b4/Rp1qN3/3Pp3/1P2P3/1B2BPPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',I don't see anything better and this might work out okay. Now if he plays f6 I can meet it with Bc4 and skewer the queen.
104,2,5,1Bc4,b'1rb2rk1/2p1nppp/8/Rp1qN3/1bBPp3/1P2P3/1B3PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',He says he missed this move.

First he has played a very powerful fork between my e1 rook and g1 king.  Most importantly he will win my queen due to his rook on d8 because I cannot protect it with my queen.  That is because I am in check so I resign.  After this game about two hours later I took an extremely hot shower and it really calmed me down.  As I had mentioned earlier a hot shower is similar to a spa treatment and this shower was 104F (22C).  After that I listened to some spa music and it took away my hyperness.  Then I went back on this site for a short time.  The hot shower combined with the spa music helped me play well in my other league game against the same opponent.  Overall spa treatments hot showers and/or spa music helps one to relax and this can make the difference in a chess game.

Perhaps threatening the pawn in case the c6 knight moves to allow the Black lsb to attack perhaps threatening to play Qe1 and kick off a fight on b4 before Black wants it.  It's tough to find a good home for this bishop here (a fianchetto would have been nice given the opportunity).  Perhaps Re1 or Qe1 then Bf4 would be better.

Ideally he would like to build more danger up before unleashing multiple threats at once but he has very low piece activity here: his f3 knight would need to go via h4 to get anywhere and even then he wouldn't be able to do a lot unless the black knight is moved or removed.  Black's pawns dominate White's bishop and White's remaining rook is in a very defensive position.  Although Black has limited activity himself he looks defensively sound.  Overall to me the position looks quite drawish though of course at this level either side could blunder easily.

Opening up the file on the king who cannot castle unless/until the White queen is dislodged for a pawn that will be easily reclaimed also allowing White to claim a better position for his knight.  Perhaps Ra6 to prepare c6 was better.

604,16,25,2Qxa8+,b'Q3k2r/2pqb1pp/3p1p2/p7/1p1N4/1P6/1PPB1PPP/4R1K1 b k -',"There may have been other choices here - 21. Nf5 looks good.
A: Black moved neither King nor Queen: 22. Rxe7 Qxe7+ 23. Nxe7 Kxe7 and White is left with a +1 material advantage that should work out ok.
B: 21. ... Qxf5 22. Qxf5  White has a Queen where Black has a pawn and a rook.  Both sides have some material but again White should do ok.
C: 21. ... Kf8 22. Rxe7 Qxe7 23. Nxe7 Kxe7 and again White has a +1 material advantage he would try to turn into something more concrete.
D: 21. ... Kd8 22. Qxa8 Qc8 23. Qxc8+ Kxc8 24. Rxe7 White finishes here with +5 material his knight and bishop against one black pawn and he can pick up that pawn at g7 immediately.  White has a decisive advantage here.
E: 21. ... 0-0-0 A tempting option that protects the rook - at the expense of 22 Qa8#

The disadvantages of these moves are not that great but they are better hidden than the biggest disadvantages of the text move.  Overall the immediate material grab is probably just as valuable if not more so making this both the most obvious and best move."

Nxe7 offers a material advantage to White although not quite as much as the best defence against the moves that follow.  It doesn't really seem to matter what White does here: the dropped rook has robbed Black of a vital defender and it matters only if he will force White to push his advantage to the end or will instead break early.

675,20,2,1dxc5,b'r4rk1/1pp1q1bp/n3Pnp1/2p1p3/1PB1p1P1/B1N4P/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',18. Too simply play c6 if white recaptures and black should be winning or at least without problems but..

677,20,4,Rf7,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/2pNp1qn/1PB1p3/B6P/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',"So on move 18 dxc5 here at first I was shocked to find 22 h4 for white. The black queen cannot stay on the diagonal to d8 which would make Nxc7 winning.
22 h4 Qg2!? 23 Rf1! and there is simply nothing black is threatening or can do against Nxc7. 

Then I found Qf5! and the mate threat stops and immediate Nxc7 giving black enough time and a decent position. So I went for this variation after all happily"
678,20,5,2b5,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/1PpNp1qn/2B1p3/B6P/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',"But I missed this one white should be winning here black can still put up a fight by sacrificing a piece for some pawns but it should be enough.
I had a good long think here and played e3 because I think white has only one really good reply and possibly the others aren't that good getting black back in the game. So its at least giving white a tough choice in this complicated position"
679,20,6,2e3,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/1PpNp1qn/2B5/B3p2P/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black has to act otherwise Nxc7 is game over
680,20,7,2Bxc5,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/1PBNp1qn/2B5/4p2P/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',"I think a mistake not sure if its losing wild position but the follow up seems pretty convincing.

23 Nxe3! is I think the strongest move for white.
It should continue 23 Nxe3 Qxe7 24 bxa6 Rxa6 or something with pawns and open king for the piece and the exchange"
681,20,8,2Qh4,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/1PBNp2n/2B4q/4p2P/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',Pretty strong not giving white and time for Bxe3 or Nxc7
682,20,9,2Qe2,b'r5k1/1pp1Prbp/n5p1/1PBNp2n/2B4q/4p2P/4QP2/R3K2R b KQ -',Now the queen is of the d-line so no more Qd8 tricks
683,20,10,2Nf6+,b'r5k1/1pp1P1bp/n4Np1/1P2p2n/2B4q/7P/4Qr2/R3K2R b KQ -',I think Qxf2 and Qxc4 should also be losing for white.

685,21,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Petroff's Defence.  A fairly flexible system for Black that I sometimes adopt to avoid going into the Ruy Lopez.
686,21,1,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',The Steinitz Attack.
687,21,2,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',At this point it would be most common (and recommended) for Black to pick up one of the pawns.  We'll see why shortly.
688,21,3,Kxd8,b'rnbk1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',White trades Queens to ensure Black can never castle.  An exposed king in a half-open centre is likely to cause trouble for Black.  Taking a pawn back at move 3 or allowing the pawn taken in move 4 to be gambitted could have prevented a lot of Black's trouble with the capture being probably slightly better.
689,21,4,Be6,b'rn1k1b1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/4N3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Black must scramble to prevent Nxf7+!.  Doing it this way also somewhat aids development.
690,21,5,h6,b'rn1k3r/ppp2pp1/4bn1p/2b1N1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black could also have given some thought to Nd7 to push away (or trade) the aggravating knight at e5 and taking him a step closer to connecting his rooks.
691,21,6,O-O-O+,b'rn1k3r/ppp2pp1/4bn1p/2b1N1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',A nice move for White that piles a little more pressure on Black
692,21,7,Kxf6,b'rn5r/ppp2pp1/4bk1p/2b1N3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',An exchange of minor pieces.  Black opts to not double his pawns at the expense of further exposing his king (although it should be relatively comfortable for the time being).  Black's position is a little ragged but for now he seems to be holding on reasonably well.
693,21,8,Bxf4,b'rn5r/ppp2pp1/4bk1p/4N3/4Pb2/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - -',Black wins back the pawn he has been down for the last ten moves and is starting to coordinate against White's kingside.  After 11. f4 it is now White who is responding to threats; if Black wants this to continue he will need to find a way to develop his rooks quickly and maintain the initiative.
694,21,9,Bg4,b'rn5r/ppp2pp1/5k1p/8/4Pbb1/2NN4/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - -',? Slightly uncertain.  The idea of countering an attack on the bishop with one on the rook is fine but after 14. Nxf4 Bxd1 15. Nxd1 Black has traded two bishops for a rook has no active pieces and his king is once again wide open.  Perhaps 13. ... Be5 was better offering a trade or Bd6 a less active but more secure post that retains the useful bishop pair.
695,21,10,1Be2,b'rn5r/ppp2pp1/5k1p/8/4Pbb1/2NN4/PPP1B1PP/1K1R3R b - -',As before I prefer Nxf4 with a White advantage to a move that retains equality.
696,21,11,Bg5,b'rn5r/ppp2pp1/5k1p/6b1/4P3/3N4/PPP1N1PP/1K1R3R w - -',Black's bishop is forced back anyway.  He has probably come out the worse for the fight despite material equality as most of his remaining army is stuck at home.
697,21,12,1Rxf7,b'rn5r/ppp2Rpk/7p/4N1b1/4P3/8/PPP1N1PP/1K1R4 b - -',The Black king has been squeezed into a corner.  The White pieces are taking up strong positions in the Black half of the board and are threatening to overwhelm the defenders in short order due in no small part to Black's failure to develop his Queenside which itself was a direct result of Black allowing White to force a recapture by the Black king back on move 5.
698,21,13,1Re8,b'rn2r3/ppp2Rpk/7p/4N1b1/4P3/8/PPP1N1PP/1K1R4 w - -',Black's development is hampered by his inability to bring out his queenside knight without disadvantage (either doubling his pawns via Nc6 Nxc6 bx6 or sticking it out of the action via Na6).  This option while providing no long-term advantage does offer a threat on the e5 knight and the e4 pawn but it seems unlikely snatching back pawns is going to offer serious hope for Black with half of his remaining men sat at home while White's forces swarm.
699,21,14,Rxe4,b'rn6/pppN1Rpk/7p/6b1/4r3/8/PPP1N1PP/1K1R4 w - -',Black takes a more aggressive line over initiating the knight trade perhaps gaining by forcing the e2 knight to move.
700,21,15,2Nc3,b'rn6/pppN1Rpk/7p/6b1/4r3/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R4 b - -',A counter-threat to the rook that disrupts Black's plans to bring about attacks of his own using the tempo gained by forcing the knight to move.
701,21,16,2Re7,b'rn6/pppNrRpk/7p/6b1/8/2N5/PPP3PP/1K1R4 w - -',Black now tries to initiate a rook trade perhaps hoping that he can overpower White's knight with his bishop in a traded-down endgame.
702,21,17,Rf8,b'5r2/pppRb1pk/7p/8/8/2N5/PPP3PP/1K6 w - -',Black hopes to sneak a back-rank mate but this move offers little else to recommend it (the rook is slightly better placed here but that's about it).  Bd6 might have been better.
703,21,18,Rf2,b'8/pppR2pk/3b3p/8/8/P1N4P/1PP2rP1/1K6 w - -',Black moves to the seventh to begin an attack on the White kingside pawns.  It will take him several moves to get behind and catch them.
704,21,19,2Nd5,b'8/pppR2pk/3b3p/3N4/8/P6P/1PP2rP1/1K6 b - -',A good move that should give White plenty of opportunity to damage the Black pawns and pull up a winning advantage as Black is about to have his bishop's protector stripped away.
705,21,20,2Rxg2,b'8/pppR2pk/3b3p/3N4/8/P6P/1PP3r1/1K6 w - -',?! Black was in difficulties after 26. Nd5 which this move does little to rectify.  He could instead have opted for Bc5 but it doesn't do much better after 27. Rxc7.  Black just can't defend those pawns and will suffer for it.
706,21,21,Rg1+,b'8/ppNR2pk/3b3p/8/8/P6P/1PP5/1K4r1 w - -',A petty check that acheives little and only delays the inevitable.
707,21,22,Rg2,b'8/ppR3pk/7p/8/8/P6P/KPP3r1/8 w - -',With the idea of winning the c-pawn but White's king guarantees Black cannot win back his fallen pawns like this.  As it stands barring a blunder from White he's probably playing to draw now.
708,21,23,3Kb3,b'8/ppR3pk/7p/8/8/PK5P/1PP3r1/8 b - -',Activating the king.
709,21,24,a5,b'8/1R4pk/7p/p7/8/PKP4r/1P6/8 w - a6',A wasted move really although forcing the White rook to move ensures no tempo is lost; Black ought to be activating his own king and perhaps trying to mobilise his pawns as a counterthreat.  Forcing the White rook towards the middle of the board does it no harm at all.
710,21,25,Rh5,b'8/1R4pk/7p/p6r/K7/P1P5/1P6/8 w - -',﻿Temporarily protecting the a-pawn but it will fall eventually.  Black should be able to trade rooks and move his h-pawn down the board to queen first.
711,21,26,Rh4,b'8/1R4pk/7p/p7/KP5r/P1P5/8/8 w - -',??  White offers a new threat to the pawn in place of the king and Black responds to it horribly. axb5 was much better.
712,21,27,Rh3,b'8/1R4pk/7p/K7/1P6/P1P4r/8/8 w - -',There really isn't much Black can do now except try to pick up pawns while waiting for White to make a mistake.  The White king is comfortably sheltered by his pawns the White rook can exert pressure on the Black king and Black's position is overall weak.  He's lost the tempo he needed to win the promotion race.
713,21,28,Rf3,b'8/2R3pk/8/KP5p/8/P1P2r2/8/8 w - -',The game is now a race to see who can promote first.  White has a decisive advantage.
714,21,29,Rf8,b'5r2/2R3pk/KP6/7p/8/P1P5/8/8 w - -',Black's rook takes up positions on the back rank but it can't save him.  The time lost by having to move his rook away from the h-file is going to kill him off (if he wasn't already dead.)  White is more than happy to trade his b-pawn for Black's rook.
715,21,30,4Ka7,b'5r2/KPR3pk/8/8/7p/P1P5/8/8 b - -',Also effective was Rc8 after which promotion cannot be stopped for more than one move.
716,21,31,4a4,b'6k1/KP3r2/6p1/8/P7/2P4R/8/8 b - -',Not that it matters but Ka8 isprobably the best move.
717,21,32,5a8=Q,b'QK6/8/8/8/6k1/2P5/8/8 b - -',
718,22,0,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Prevents a pin/check on b4 from a bishop speeds up a potential b4 advance and also makes it harder for a knight to land on c2.
719,22,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3P4/P3P3/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This now looks like a french defence only with the added move a3.
720,22,2,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The boring exchange variation. 3. ...Nc6 Nd7 or e4 were more interesting.
721,22,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P2b1/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ...Bd6 preparing castling would have been slightly better I think.

724,22,6,Qd6,b'rn3rk1/ppp1bppp/3q1n2/3p4/3P4/P1N1BQ1P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',I think that after 9. ...c6 black is back on the path to equality as his center is too solid for me to get anything against him. However now the queen blocks in his bishop and I am ahead in development so black must play precisely to stay out of trouble.
725,22,7,1O-O-O,b'r4rk1/ppp1bppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3P4/P1NBBQ1P/1PP2PP1/2KR3R b - -',I am preparing to potentially attack on the kingside or just aim for central play. Black has an uncomfortable position but I think he can still draw if he is careful
726,22,8,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/ppp1bppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3P4/P1NBBQ1P/1PP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',?? This move loses.

731,22,13,Qa4,b'3r1rk1/Npp1bppp/5n2/3p4/q2B4/P2B1Q1P/1PP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',? Another mistake. Now the queen gets trapped again!

734,22,16,Qxb4,b'3r1rk1/Npp2ppp/5n2/1B1p4/1q1B4/5Q1P/2P2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Now I am 2 pieces up for 2 pawns so all I have to do is exchange pieces and enter a winning endgame.

736,22,18,c6,b'3r1rk1/Np3p1p/2p2p2/1B1p4/6P1/8/2P2PP1/2KR3R w - -',If I retreat my bishop then 23. ...Ra8 wins the knight
737,22,19,2Bxc6,b'3r1rk1/5p1p/2B2p2/3p4/6P1/8/2P2PP1/2KR3R b - -',Now I must exchange rooks.

1223,39,29,2Qc6,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1qp4/2b5/2B2P2/1KP4P/PP6/R6R w - -',That's step 1.
1224,39,30,2Bxf7,b'2kr3r/1pp2Bpp/p1qp4/2b5/5P2/1KP4P/PP6/R6R b - -',I was not expecting that but I didn't care.
1225,39,31,2Qb5+,b'2kr3r/1pp2Bpp/p2p4/1qb5/5P2/1KP4P/PP6/R6R w - -',Plan C: Queenside pawn push when or if I distract the Rooks... not a very bright plan.
1226,39,32,2f5,b'1k3r1r/1pp3pp/p2pB3/1qb2P2/8/2P4P/PPK5/R6R b - -',...Bb6 then Rxf5 unless Rf1.
1227,39,33,2Rfe8,b'1k2r2r/1pp3pp/p2pB3/1qb2P2/8/2P4P/PPK5/R6R w - -',I set up my Rook and I will see if g6 is possible.
1228,39,34,2a4,b'1k2r2r/1pp3pp/p2pB3/1qb2P2/P7/2P4P/1PK5/R6R b - a3',Free pawn. Honestly I don't know what was up with me on my next move.
1229,39,35,Qh5,b'1k2r2r/1pp4p/p2pB1p1/2b2P1q/P7/1KP4P/1P6/4R2R w - -',This would be why.
1230,39,36,Re7,b'1k3r2/1pp1rP1p/p2pB1p1/2b4q/P7/1KP4P/1P6/4R2R w - -',"I thought that Plan B was the ""impossible plan by now and that C was too risky and it gets me into traps. This move was not necessary. 31...Rxe6! is what I missed. 32.Rxe6 Qd5+ would prove that plan B was still alive."
1231,39,37,3Ka2,b'1k3r2/1pp1rP1p/p2pB1p1/2b4q/P7/2P4P/KP6/4R2R b - -',I still could do Rxe6 and get the same results.
1232,39,38,3g5,b'1k3r2/1pp1rP1p/p2pB3/2b3pq/P7/2P4P/KP6/4R2R w - -',This move was worse than Re7.
1233,39,39,Bf2,b'1k3r2/1pp1rP1p/p2pB3/6pq/PP6/2P4P/K4b2/4R2R w - -',Ther was still another idea. Rfxf7 or Rexf7. I don't know which one is better but I have a great feeling that they're both equal.
1234,39,40,3Bg4,b'1k3r2/1pp1rP1p/p2p4/6pq/PP4B1/2P4P/K4b2/4R2R b - -',There goes the pawn...
1235,39,41,3Ka3,b'1k3r2/1pp1rq1p/p2p4/6p1/PP4B1/K1P4P/5b2/4R2R b - -',and ther goes the Rook that Plan C covered. Atleast one of my plans worked but remember that I wasted moves and lost many opportunities.
1236,39,42,3Rxe1,b'1k3r2/1pp2q1p/p2p4/6p1/PP4B1/K1P4P/5b2/4R3 b - -',With the Rooks gone I can now forget about the Bishop unless otherwise.
1237,39,43,3Bxe1,b'1k3r2/1pp2q1p/p2p4/6p1/PP4B1/K1P4P/8/4b3 w - -',My plan: simply take the c3 pawn with the Bishop and invade White's corrupted forces.
1238,39,44,3Be2,b'1k3r2/1pp2q1p/p2p4/6p1/PP6/K1P4P/4B3/4b3 b - -',My plan can commence.
1239,39,45,Qf1,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/PP6/K1b4P/8/3B1q2 w - -',There was a better move than this 38...Qc4 then Rf2 creates a crushing combination that the Bishop cannot withstand by itself. 38...Qc4 39.Bb3 Qxb4+ 40.Ka2 Rf2+ 41.Kb1 Qxb3+ 42.Kc1 Qc2#.
1240,39,46,3Bc2,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/PP6/K1b4P/2B5/5q2 b - -',Now 39...Qa1+ 40.Kb3 Qb2+ 41.Kc4.
1241,39,47,Qb2+,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/PP6/1Kb4P/1qB5/8 w - -',You might laugh at me here (I don't blame you) but I actually thought this was checkmate and did not pay attention to the c4 square.
1242,39,48,4Kc4,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/PPK5/2b4P/1qB5/8 b - -',Until he moved there. However I did not lose my grip on White.
1243,39,49,4Bxb4,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/PbK5/7P/1qB5/8 w - -',This move wins permanently. No matter what move he plays I'll respond with Re1.
1244,39,50,4Kd3,b'1k3r2/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/Pb6/3K3P/1qB5/8 b - -',Especially this move.
1245,39,51,4Re8,b'1k2r3/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/Pb6/3K3P/1qB5/8 w - -',Mate in 1 is now visible.
1246,39,52,4Bd1,b'1k2r3/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/Pb6/3K3P/1q6/3B4 b - -',Qc3 mates.
1247,39,53,4Qc3#,b'1k2r3/1pp4p/p2p4/6p1/Pb6/2qK3P/8/3B4 w - -',"That's the game. Something occured to me during this game; it was the motto ""When faced with a challenge look for a way not a way out."" Aside from missing out on early opportunities and missing out on tactical advantages I finally pulled though and checkmated White. There is more than one way to do something. Next time I should think more slowly to get the best moves possible. You make a decision it becomes your choice and it leads you to your consequences."
