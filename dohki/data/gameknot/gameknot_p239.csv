If I can chase away the black knight at f6 say by pushing my pawn to e5 then capture at d7 with something other than my queen I can probably win material here. Hence the bishop move to a4. Now I can unmask the bishop's attack on d7 with a move like Na5 threatening black's queen. I can't force any of this yet but I'm maneuvering toward making this happen. More importantly that advanced knight on c6 needs some more defenders.

Although in retrospect I think all of black's squirming still must cost him at least one pawn so it may have been the better choice. As played 32. Bd6 is back on the table as a credible threat to win black's bishop.

I am inclined to give this move an exclamation 15. Qa5 ! for the pure simplistic beauty of its quiet but inexorable threat.
226,8,13,1Rfe1,b'rn2k1nr/p3q2p/2p1Bpp1/Qp6/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I have to give this move a ! because black cannot get out of all the threats. He cannot stay where he is because white can play 17. Bxg8 which discovers the attack by the white rook on e1 that skewers the black queen to her king. Moving the queen allows white to play the same move with discovered check gaining a piece. And moving the king allows white to play the same move with a discovered attack against the black queen also gaining a piece.

Qd7 to which she can run in which case white's bishop escapes perhaps to e6 with an attack on the harried black queen. Black might try to diffuse the situation with 17. ... Qxe1  18. Rxe1 Rxg8 though white would meet that with 19. Qd8  Kg7 20. Qe7  Kh8 21. Qb7 Na6 22. Re7 and mate to follow. 
228,8,15,1Qd8#,b'rn1Q1kBr/p5qp/2p2pp1/1p6/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Black chose poorly. As it is the move played must receive three ??? for white's response is instant victory. It's an odd position. The white bishop on g8 is attacked by 3 pieces and defended by none. And yet it is perfectly safe and even better it blocks black's escape to c7 thus allowing the white queen to achieve the mate. Rarely have I seen a piece in such a dire predicament play such an important role in a mating position.
229,9,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I started this game with the Queen`s Gambit like I usually do. It`s not one of the sharpest openings but the positions most commonly turn out to be interesting. 
230,9,1,Qb3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I had never seen this move before so I decided to follow the database. This move seemed pretty nice to me because it attacks the pawns on d5 and b7. On the other hand white has already moved his Queen and if black should manage to hunt the queen while developing his own pieces he might get a huge opening advantage.
231,9,2,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',B7 appears to be hanging but after 4.Qxb7 Nd7 follows 4...Rb8 and black gets open files while having two more pieces in play. I am sure this would be enough compensation for one or two pawns.

But it still appears that white is in trouble. First of all d4 is hanging secondly after e.g. 6.Nf3 black threatens not only 6...Nb4 which would be met with 7.e4 dxe4 8.Ne5 with a nice attack but could prepare this with 6...Nf6 and white still has difficulties to find something against the fork on c2. I didn`t like 6.Be3 which protects d4 either. It just looked wrong to block the pawn on e2. 
After 6.Qxb7 obviously follows 6...Nxd4.
However I found a move I do like very much because it looks very pretty and is actually quite strong."

6...Nf6 7.Qxb7 Nxd4 8.0-0-0 and I think white is better.
6...Nxd4 7.Qa4  Bd7 8.Qxd4 Qxg5 9.Nxd5 Bd6 with a difficult position but a white extra-pawn.
6...f6 7.Bf4 Nxd4 8.Qa4  Nc6 9. 0-0-0 and I`ll not only get the d5 pawn but the game will get pretty sharp and the black king is in the middle. 
However although I would like the positions after 6...Nxd4 and 6...f6 they are still unclear and probably more or less even. "

I seem to recall my understanding of this defense was to build my 4 center pawns up by chasing the black knight - this was considered strong for white.

Still taking the knight gets his queen further into play and I don't want him to take my knight on f3 and isolate some of my pawns. Also he might just chase away that far-flung bishop and get his royal fork. So castling seems a good solution.

Or I can just kill the bishop. I am also unmasking a rook attack against the pawn on f4 but while the black queen is threatening my rook on a1 I cannot play my f-rook off of my back rank.
289,10,19,2Qxh5,b'r3kr2/pp3p1B/2n1b3/6NQ/2P2p2/4q3/P5PP/R4R1K b q -',I hate running my queen out of the backfield when black's queen is so close to my under-defended and cornered king. Still it looks safe I need to balance the material before it is too late. Besides I'm now building up an strong attack along the e-file threatening black's queen with a rook and when she moves either my knight or rook can take the bishop at e6 while his only pawn defender is pinned by my queen.
290,10,20,2Nxe6,b'r3kr2/pp3p1B/4N3/4n2Q/2P2p2/4q3/P5PP/R4R1K b q -',Oops. Black's move 23. ... Ne5? was a blunder. That bishop only had one defender - the queen at e3. The pawn at f7 is pinned. And now the Knight has a new attack planned at c7 - black needs to see to the defense. And I still have Rae1 in store to force the black queen to move whereupon my rook or queen can take the knight at e5.

Rae1 but finally concluded that while the latter wins more material it runs the risk of losing the bishop at h7 and the former leaves the possibility open that I can play both. For example: 25. Nc7  Kd7 26. Nxa8 Rxa8 27. Rae1 Qmoves 28. Qxe5.
292,10,22,2Nxa8,b'N6r/pp1k1p1B/8/4n2Q/2P2p2/4q3/P5PP/R4R1K b - -',Black resigned. Apparently black concluded that he could capture the knight at a8 but then lose his knight at e5 leaving him down by a rook and bishop (and then the pawn at f5 will certainly fall too) or he could save his own knight but then he his only defense against 27. Bf5  and 28. Qxh8 is to play 26. ... Ng3 which still loses: 27. Rad1  Kc6 28. Qb5# or 27. Qd5  Ke7 (or Ke8) 28. Rae1 and black's queen falls or 27. Qd5  Kc8 28. Qxf7 Ne7 29. Rae1 Qc5 30.

I'm ahead by a pawn so I'm thinking about exchanging now. Black's bishop on c6 threatens my pawn on g2 but I have a simple fix for that - exchanging him.

Perhaps he believes taking the white rook is threat enough to spare his knight or compensation enough if the knight falls. I feel inclined to disprove this belief by eliminating the last castle defender.

The noble rook took one for the team and now white has checkmate in 1 so black resigns. One cannot help but notice that white had 5 developed pieces to black's 1 (though admittedly part of that is due to white gobbling two undefended black pieces).

I must remember the 5 virtues Patience Perseverence Endurance Humility and Tolerance.   Here is certainly another taste of humility for jstevens1!

I am determined to last as long as possible against Freddy but I am looking out for opportunities to do more than that - even with my limited knowledge but here I decide to concentrate on building a fortress for Henry and christen it Fort Joblock.  It seems to hold and I think I have everything covered but alas Freddy made me think again!  He starts of with d3 which is the Mieses Opening.

I now follow up my plan and decide that the queenside is the safest place for Henry to be after all although my queenside castling position looks a little draughty Henry is flanked by Glenda Fou Leblanc and a horsie.  Henry will be as safe as houses over there especially as it seems that Freddy also intends to castle queenside.  I could take the pawn on g4 but then Freddy will only skewer my knight against the g7 pawn.  So I first play h6 then Bb7 and then castle as planned.

On the one hand general rule is that when you're up by a pawn exchange pieces when you're up by a piece exchange pawns. So ostensibly the pawn exchanges can help black get to a drawn endgame. But on the other hand these exchanges have created a pair of adjacent passed pawns for white on the b and c files. Those pawns should be able to support each other and press for promotion unopposed by anything but pieces - played right I should be able to gain material as black sacrifices to stop their advance.

431,20,15,2bxa5,b'b2r2k1/4bppp/1q3n2/PN6/3Np3/2P5/B4PPP/2BQR1K1 b - -',OK capturing caused me to voluntarily isolate my two passed pawns one of which falls instantly leaving me up by exactly a knight. I wasn't sure if this was a wise line of play. I cannot win a king knight vs. king endgame. That's a draw. But I can win a king pawn vs. pawn endgame. I traded the winnable endgame to a draw endgame banking on the opportunity to use my extra piece and my passed but isolated c-pawn to gain additional material before everything gets traded down. I truly don't know which path is best.

My opponent has been offline for 5 days and has had over a dozen consecutive games timeout during that time. Apparently he is away - I hope he is well. As for this game as my previous comment states my intention is to play for advancing the c-pawn banking on my extra knight to ensure its safety and hoping to force black to sacrifice more material to prevent its promotion. Black's advance pawn on e4 looks like a possible target too. This game still had a lot of potential for both sides. Too bad we didn't get to finish it.

However it may be helpful in identifying what not to do and it shows how to hold an extra pawn without generating other weaknesses among one's camp. It also shows a little tactical shot available to white when the king is centered even in the endgame when queens are exchanged. I also need practice annotating. Any comments and suggestions would be great."
560,27,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The French Defense. A very solid system for black. Black usually concedes space early in the game and also voluntarily blocks the c8 bishop. In many games this bishop becomes a problem to develop but black's plan is usually to initiate a queenside attack or to trade off into an endgame when black's pawn structure would grant him an advantage. White opts to keep black cramped and avoid simplification (unless it favors him of course).
561,27,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',? This move is statistically bad for black. As long as white doesn't make mistakes it is a won game. Black chooses to undermine the center without realizing that he will lose material. It may possibly be used as a gambit but it is one that doesn't offer black any sort of compensation. It could have been just a mistake on the player's part but given that he must have played this system and has won some games that may unlikely be the case.
562,27,3,Bxc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/8/2bp4/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? another mistake which practically costs black the game. Not only does he lose a pawn but he loses the queen as well guaranteeing white a won game. Black has no queen to generate threats as compensation for the pawn. Better was 5..Nf6 protecting the d pawn. There was no rush to take the pawn. 
563,27,4,Qxd8+,b'rnbQk1nr/pp3ppp/8/8/1b6/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Because of this black's king remains centered and the exchange of queens favors White greatly.

565,27,6,Bd7,b'rn1k2nr/pp1b1ppp/8/2b5/8/2N5/PPPB1PPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Developing both bishops before both knights is usually bad and it is a general rule to develop both knights before both bishops. Though Black was in a desperate situation he had better options. The threat was 10. Be3  winning a piece.
566,27,7,1Bb5,b'2rk3r/pp1bnppp/2n5/1Bb5/8/2N2P2/PPPBN1PP/2KR3R b - -',And here I plan on ceding my two bishops and allowing black the two bishops. In an open game such as this the extra pawn usually doesn't give an advantage as the two bishops would equalize the position. However I was confident that I could force further trades and the black king is still centered. This as we will see becomes a problem for him.

The white pawns in the center feel strong enough compared to black's isolated pawn in the center. In return white has an isolated pawn on a2 but it's less of a concern at the moment. The threat on h7 and d5 seems to win a pawn but only temporarily since the white pawn on c3 is backward and hard to defend.

Either way the H2 pawn needs rescuing and the c3 pawn is doomed. Or the other way around. I was temped to save the c3 pawn since after 15. ... Bxh2  16 Kh1 black doesn't seem to have a pressing attack. Still that felt too risky and the Game DB didn't like it much either.

All along the DB indicated the moves I chose were white's best chances and they all favored white. Still here I am with a weak isolated pawn on d4 a bishop en prise on d3 and black has 4 pieces well placed centrally and seems to be marshaling for an attack while my feeble mate threat does nothing more than slow him down. I feel the advantage here is definitely black's no matter what the Game DB said - I have been deceived.

610,29,10,2Rd2,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/5Qp1/3b4/3P4/q2B3P/P2R1PP1/2R3K1 b - -',??? This loses immediately. Obviously. This was not the move I had meant to play. I had spent a lot of time analyzing multiple lines trying to find a way to a drawish endgame. After a long time of analysis I concluded that 21. Rc2 was my best option. If 21. ... Bxa2 22. Ra1 looks good. I think I may have saved the a-pawn and held the position for quite a while seeking exchanges and hoping for an advantage from my passed d-pawn.

N x c3 N x b3 then a rook move to break the pin.  B can either capture the N or move his own now threatened N.  Either way he ends up losing a piece for 2 pawns.  W's dark-squared B is very strong almost as strong as B's rooks and B should prevail without much difficulty.  19.Qe3 ends all of these complications and B is just better.

I was playing against a guy called Andy who had a similar rating to myself.  Andy played very well but somehow I managed to get a rook onto his second rank and that piggish rook made slop of one of his pawns and eventually more and more material dropped until I was able to crown my a pawn.  Andy resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material but Freddy who looked at this game said I had a mate in 3 - more on that later.  Anyhow - I face the Sicilian and I play an unusual 3rd move Bc4 instead of the standard pawn exchange on d4.

Bxb6 - the mating attack does not materialise but I was quite happy to exchange queens and my knight for his dsb because I was a pawn up.

Black defends his e pawn but I am still able to snap off the h6 pawn with check - as his king is confined to the edge of the board he will not be able to attack my knight after the capture so I will be able to take on h6 and then move Fou Lenoir out of the black rook's path.

However I feel very cold all of a sudden see a dark shadow and something stinks - what could that be but Old Matey!  Yes even with 4 points up in material and with a passer certain to crown I could end up being crowned if I am not careful.  For if the h pawn goes Henry could be vulnerable to a corridor mate along the h file.  His horsie will go to e2 and his bishop to f1 cutting off Henry's escape.

I must say I'm pretty proud of this one. My oppnent gave me fits and kept me in a straight jacket for almost 20 moves. This is by far the hardest defensive struggle I have undergone in any of my recent chess games.
662,34,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"White chose the ""Close Variation"" often considered positional rather than sharp and I followed with the main line."

671,34,10,Qe7,b'r3k1nr/pp2qp1p/2n1p1p1/8/8/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/R1B2R1K w kq -',White's move threatened the backward f7 pawn. I defended it with my queen. I looked long and hard at playing 15. ... f5 instead but decided against primarily because it leaves the pawn at e6 backward and vulnerable on a half-open file. Given how things turned out in this game I think faced with this move in the future I would choose advancing the pawn over defending with the queen. As played I am putting myself into a straight jacket of my own choosing and will spend many moves laboriously struggling to get out of it.
672,34,11,Qc7,b'r3k1nr/ppq2p1p/2n1p1p1/6B1/8/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/R4R1K w kq -',My poor royal lady is being chased by a mere bishop. How demeaning...
673,34,12,h6,b'r3k1nr/ppq2p2/2n1p1pp/6B1/8/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/4RR1K w kq -',White has brought 4 pieces to bear on the black king who is trapped in the center. While he is well defended the ferocity of white's attack cannot be ignored. Black must play carefully here. Note that his king's knight is trapped with no moves (Ne7? results in Qxf7) and while that knight is trapped there is no hope for the black rook on h8 to get involved either. The black rook on a8 has room to play but little role in the defense at this time. Essentially black's pieces and pawns are all in each others' way and he is defending against a four-piece attack with only two pieces.
674,34,13,Qd7,b'r3k1nr/pp1q1p2/2n1p1pp/8/5B2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/4RR1K w kq -',Again my queen is harassed. She cannot leave the 7th rank or the f7 pawn will fall (white's bishop blocks the attack so the queen has more options right now but a single move by the bishop such as Bxh6 and white is back in business on the f7 pawn). The straight jacket is so uncomfortable!
675,34,14,Nd4,b'r3k1nr/pp1q1p2/4p1pp/8/3n4/3P1QB1/PPP3PP/4RR1K w kq -',Aha! I find a little and mostly ineffective attack of my own. But at least it's something a little wiggle room in the straight jacket.

677,34,16,f6,b'r3k1nr/pp1q4/4pppp/4Bn2/8/3P4/PPP2QPP/4RR1K w kq -',Saving the rook and chasing away the bishop. Maybe a tiny bit more wiggle room now but not much - I'm still firmly tied in knots.
678,34,17,h5,b'r3k1nr/pp1q4/4ppp1/5n1p/8/2BP4/PPP2QPP/4RR1K w kq -',Black is still tied up in knots. His knight on g8 cannot move or he loses the pawn on f6. The h8 rook is still mostly trapped out of the way though he has a little room to move - just not much reason to move. The black queen is still tied to defense now she protects the pawn at e6. One false step and the whole thing crumbles. This move prevents white from easily playing a pawn to g4.
679,34,18,e5,b'r3k1nr/pp1q4/5pp1/4pn1p/8/2BP4/PPP1Q1PP/4RR1K w kq -',Advancing the pawn lets his brother on f6 defend him and at the same times takes some of the pressure off of the f6 pawn.
680,34,19,O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/pp1q4/5pp1/4pn1p/8/2BP4/PPP1Q1PP/3R1R1K w - -',White seemed to be setting up 25. d4. Castling brings my distant rook into the picture unpins the e5 pawn and gets the king out of immediate harms' way - all good. And now with 4 threats on d4 white's d-pawn is going nowhere. I have been in this straight jacket for 9 moves now and this is the first time I can feel it noticeably loosening up.
681,34,20,Nd4,b'2kr2nr/pp1q4/5pp1/4p2p/3n4/2BP1R2/PPP1Q1PP/3R3K w - -',White plans to double rooks on the f-file but his move lets me trade off his bishop by forking him - he must capture the knight.

685,34,24,Nf5,b'2kr3r/pp6/1q3pp1/4pn1p/8/2PP1R1P/PP2Q1P1/4R2K w - -',In retrospect I'm glad white didn't play 29. d4 while my e5 pawn was pinned (29. ... exd4 30. Qxe7 costs black his knight). So I move the knight to unpin the e5 pawn and put pressure on d4 and at the same time blocking white's rook's attack on the f6 pawn freeing my queen from that defensive duty. I feel another buckle on the straight jacket come undone and I'm just about free of it.
686,34,25,Qd6,b'2kr3r/pp6/3q1pp1/4pn1p/8/2PP1R1P/PP2Q1PK/4R3 w - -',I am not sure what 30. kh2 did for white other than keeping the black knight from the royal fork on g3. For now the white rook on f3 has that covered and that rook doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon so maybe white was just playing a waiting move and covering his bases. My move threatens 31. ... e4  to win the white rook on f3.
687,34,26,Qa6,b'2kr3r/pp6/q4pp1/4pn1p/8/2PP1R1P/PP2Q1P1/4R1K1 w - -',Forking two pawns though the pawn on d3 is well enough defended. I am thinking of doubling rooks on the half-open d-file and putting white into his own straight jacket. Maybe see how he feels about it for a change.

White has no useful attacks and my pieces are no longer all tied to critical defenses. So now I launch a campaign of my own. White's queen was tied to the defense of the pawn on b2 but he moved her away. Time to pounce! After 18 moves in that straight jacket I'm ready to leap at anything that feels like an attack!
690,34,29,Qxb2,b'2k4r/pp6/3r1pp1/4pn1p/4Q3/P1PP1R1P/1q4PK/4R3 w - -',Gobble. But now white has an excellent response that I did not anticipate.
691,34,30,Qxa3,b'2k4r/pp6/3r1pp1/4pn1p/3PQ3/q1P2R1P/6PK/4R3 w - -',Uh oh white is threatening my pawn at e5 (36. Pxe5 Pxe5? 37. Qxe5 and white gains a pawn forks both rooks and forces black to get back on defense). But worse he's threatening 36. Rb1! skewering the black queen against the b7 pawn. After 36. ... Qxa3 37. Qxb7  Kmoves 38. Qb8  Kmoves 39. Qxh8 and now white is right back in the game material is even and black's kingside is going to crumble as the white queen attacks it from the rear. I search around for the move that prevents both eventualities but there is none. So I take the a3 pawn extending my material lead to a knight and 2 pawns knowing I will lose a pawn in the center and have to run back on defense.
692,34,31,Qxa1,b'2k4r/pp6/3r1pp1/4pn1p/3PQ3/2P2R1P/6PK/q7 w - -',I don't know how this happened. My guess is white knew how strong Rb1 could have been and he realized that Ra1 could chase my queen to the b-file and allow him to play that devastating Rb1. In fact when I returned to this board and saw his rook on a1 threatening me I panicked a little thinking I would have to do just that flee to the scary b-file. Until I realized that the rook on a1 had no defender - the one flaw in white's plan. So I gobble him up and white takes the noble way out resigning to spare the rest of his pieces from violent ends on the field of battle. I spent 18 moves in this 36-move game in that confounded straight jacket. Half the game. Lesson learned: the queen is not a defender.

I don't know what he thought to gain other than maybe security against a queen exchange if the pawns trade off in the center. And he blocks in his king's bishop. Or maybe he had is eye on taking the e4 pawn after he plays 6. ... exd4 though that is foiled easily enough and the simple expedience of castling handles this rather effortlessly and develops the king's rook in the process.

White is threatening multiple checkmates and multiple pawns will fall if black can find some way to avoid mate.
707,35,14,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1k1r/pp5p/5p2/3N3Q/1bnN4/1B6/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Black evidently felt that counterattacking was the best defense. He probably thought his move pinned the knight at c3. If nothing else he seems to have created an escape hatch for his king at f7 - which I promptly close for him as well as capturing a pawn and threatening the bishop on b4 - all of which is obvious and none of which is the main reason behind the move.

720,36,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Black accepted the gambit so I continue by developing along orthodox lines.
721,36,3,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/2p5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I guess this is called the side variation. I don't know much about it so I'm winging it from here. I think I'm supposed to claim the center with 4. e4 but I decide to defer that by one move.
722,36,4,e4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/n2P4/2p1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',5. Qa4  was tempting but black might be able to weasel out with 5. ... c6 although one feasible continuation seems to be 6. Bd2 b6 7. Bxa5 bxa5 8. Qxc6  Bd7 9. Qxc4 leaving white ahead by a pawn and black's doubled pawns on the a-file will do him no favors.
723,36,5,Qa4+,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/n2P4/Q1p1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',OK now it works quite nicely. Black might have wanted to consider alternatives to early development of his queen as well as consider the precarious and ineffective position of his knight on the edge of the board with no safe move. 5. ... b6 would be a consideration here as would be 5. ... c6 or 5. ... Bd7.
724,36,6,dxc6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2Pq4/8/Q1p1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',White wins the black knight and in the process triples the black pawns on the c-file.
725,36,7,Qxc6+,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2Q5/8/2p1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Black offers the exchange of queens which white is willing to accept given his material advantage and the fact that the black queen is more centrally located and making threats against white's center.
726,36,8,Bxc4,b'r1b1kbnr/p1p1pppp/2p5/8/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',As much as I enjoy my opponent's tripled pawns it seems prudent to develop my bishop seize more of the center and put pressure on black's weak pawn at f7.

729,36,11,1Bf4,b'r3kb1r/p1p1p1pp/2p1pn2/8/4PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Developing center threatening. All good. Note the difference in development here. White has 3 pieces developed to black's 1. In addition white has dominated the center and is poised to castle to bring his rooks to bear. On the other hand black cannot easily develop his bishop or his kingside rook. The black pieces and pawns are getting in each others' way. And let's not overlook black's hopeless pawn structure. It's clearly time for white to attack.

It's useful to observe that white now has 4 pieces developed to black's 2 and calling black's rook on c8 ""developed"" is generous - it has nowhere to go and is tied to defending the blocked c7 pawn against the inevitable Nb5 that white is just itching to play."
735,36,17,1Nxe5,b'2r1kb1r/B1p1p1pp/8/4N3/2p1Pn2/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b k -',Black gave away his e6 pawn but doubled and isolated as it was this is not really too much of a loss.

737,36,19,2Bd4,b'2r1k2r/2p3pp/4p3/8/1bNBPn2/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b k -',Of course white is willing to exchange. Black can do some damage to my pawn structure with 21. ... Bxc3 and 22. ... Ne7  and 23. ... Nxc3 but it costs him as he will exchange minor pieces twice something he cannot afford to do. Meanwhile I am threatening another pawn this time on the kingside at g7.

740,36,22,2Nd4,b'2r2rk1/6pp/2p1p1n1/4B3/1bNNP3/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',At this point black can continue defending pawns say by 23. ... Rfe8 but I would meet that with 24. Nd6 forcing an exchange of material. Black is down by a minor piece and two pawns and faced with exchanging more material and a hopeless endgame. His lonely isolated pawn on c6 cannot be saved - white has more pieces to bring to bear against it than black has to defend it. Black chooses to wave the flag of surrender.
