Pur essendo stato un forte giocatore, vincitore di numerosi tornei, Friedrich Sämisch è noto soprattutto per aver dato il suo nome a due importanti varianti di apertura:
Alla difesa est indiana: 1. d4 Cf6 2. c4 g6 3. Cc3 Ag7 4. e4 d6 5. f3
Alla difesa Nimzowitsch: 1. d4 Cf6 2. c4 e6 3. Cc3 Ab4. 4. a3

Nel 1950 fu uno dei 27 giocatori che la FIDE nominò Grande maestro quando il titolo venne ufficialmente creato.

Nel torneo di Carlsbad del 1929 non ottenne una buona classifica, ma vinse il premio di bellezza per la partita contro Grünfeld. Nello stesso torneo vinse anche con José Raúl Capablanca. Il grande cubano fece una svista in apertura e perse un pezzo, ma anziché abbandonare, come avviene in questo caso nelle partite di alto livello, tentò di resistere. Lo svantaggio si dimostrò troppo grande anche per un giocatore della sua classe. Questa sconfitta costò a Capablanca il primo posto nel torneo (si classificò pari secondo a mezzo punto da Aaron Nimzowitsch).

Noi in questo forum cercheremo di scrutare più a fondo la variante della difesa est indiana

1. d4 Cf6
2. c4 g6
3. Cc3 Ag7
4. e4 d6
5. f3 (Il bianco consolida la struttura dei pedoni centrali, riservandosi di rispondere alla spinta del nero in e5 o c5 con la spinta in d5, assicurandosi una forte catena pedoni sulle case bianche. In questa variante, usualmente, il bianco arrocca lungo; contrariamente al normale sviluppo strategico della partita con arrocchi eterogenei e centro bloccato, qui il bianco e il nero possono condure l’attacco e il contrattacco anche sugli stessi settori sul quale arroccato il proprio Re. (fonte Porreca)
5. … O-O (Si può giocare anche subito 5. … e5, dato che in caso di 6. dxe, dxe; 7. Dxd8+ Rxd8; 8. Ag5 c6 ecc. il bainco non ottiene nulla.) 
Come scritto anche sulle informazioni di Gknot, scopriamo che dopo questa posizione, esistono diverse possibilità (sottovarianti)
6. e5 King's Indian (E85), Saemisch, variante ortodossa
6. b6 King's Indian (E82), Saemisch, double fianchetto variation
6. c6 King's Indian (E81), Saemisch, Byrne variation

Abbiamo un amico, Stefano (ircmancer) che è molto interessato a questa variante dell’est-indiana. Per lui, ed altri interessati apro questo forum sperando di fare cosa gradita.

A questo punto, continuando dalla 6° mossa del bianco Stefano ed io continuiamo questa partita cercando di seguire una sequenza di mosse più consona possibile alla variante Saemisch e commentando di volta in volta le mosse che giocheremo. "

Klaus dimostra coraggio (altra qualità importante), con Db6 crea pressione e diversivo sul lato di donna, e mi mette in pensiero per il mio progetto di arroccare lungo, e per la possibile pressione su d4. In compenso, allontana la regina dal lato di re.
Inoltre, c'è il pedone al sarin in b2, sacrificandolo, allontanerei ulteriormente la regina nera dall'azione, ma direi addio all'arrocco lungo.
Potrei mettermi a caccia della regina con Ch4, e alla fine della variante avrei i cavalli in buona posizione sul lato di donna, ma vorrebbe dire posporre l'attacco dal lato opposto. In generale, cerco sempre di stare nel piano originale, a meno di un'ottima occasione.

Devo riconoscere che queste attitudini non brillano nel mio curriculum.

Dopo questa piccola confessione, proseguiamo con la nostra partita.
Penso che dopo aver posizionato la mia Donna in b6, posso permettermi di cercare di indebolire il tuo centro. I pedoni in linea sono estremamente ostici da abbattere, meglio farlo subito.
Penso che prima di occuparti del pedone in d4, andrai a eliminare il mio cavallo in f6 per proseguire cercando di minacciare la mia donna con il tuo cavallo (Cd5). Sono comunque supposizioni.

Eppure non mi convince, non saprei che piano adottare nel frattempo (l'attacco dal lato di re non va, con tre pedoni contro quattro) e non mi piace, oltre che essere poco salutare, aspettare e scambiare.
Preferisco stare sul semplice. Dopo Cxd4, mi aspetto Cf6, e portando il cavallo in b3 potrò, Klaus permettendo, fare il sospirato arrocco lungo e iniziare l'attacco dal lato di re.

Per vincere non bisogna giocare solo bene, in questo modo tutte le partite finirebbero patte, ma indurre l'avversario ad un errore o uno sbandamento della struttura e profittarne.
Logicamente con Stefano non siamo ancora arrivati a questo punto.

Una valutazione complessiva, al momento, concede al nero quel leggerissimo vantaggio che questa apertura da.

Ho cercato altre volte di piantare questo germe di interesse, senza un eccessivo successo. Questa volta però ho l'impressione che stiamo andando verso la giusta direzione.
Considero Stefano un ottimo partner di scacchiera. Mi piace il suo modo di giocare e il modo di esporre le sue teorie.

Ripeto che il risultato non ha alcun valore. L'importante è il modo di esporre il gioco e cercare di attizzare il maggior interesse e consenso possibile.

Chiunque può intervenire nel forum della partita dicendo la propria e non deve assolutamente farsi restio a dare la propria opinione o proposta pensando che la stessa possa sembrare debole o priva di interesse; al contrario. E' ben spiegando le illogicità che alla fine si riesce a costruire un ragionamento logico.

Mi ero riproposto di fare Te1? Accidenti. Questo è uno dei nemici dello scacchista, si chiama “calo di motivazione”. In pratica quando si pensa di stare perdendo la partita, la si è già persa, E la qualità delle mosse va di conseguenza. Da non confondere con il “calo di concentrazione” che avviene quando si pensa di aver vinto. In tutt’e due i casi, il disastro è dietro l'angolo.
Ho esaminato la sciagurata 23. Te1 sotto un altro punto di vista, la possibilità di sacrificare il cavallo per un tempo, per poter permettere dopo Txe6 l'avanzata del pedone d, c'è un certo pericolo per il nero ma la semplice contromossa di spostare il re in colonna f rende tutto inutile.
Dunque, Tf1. Klaus a questo punto gioca Ad2. A me non conviene lo scambio di cavalli, perché poche mosse più tardi Klaus si ritrova il pedone in e5 e l'alfiere in d4, che si difendono l’un l'altro, in una configurazione che amo (quando riesco a farla) ma odio affrontare, e per giunta in Piazza Duomo. No no, 24. Cb5 Ce4, come giustamente suggerito da Klaus.
A questo punto, sono indeciso tra due mosse. Cc7 porta ad uno scambio di pedoni, poi il mio cavallo deve tornare indietro sui suoi zoccoli perché da e6 non c'è dove andare. Più interessante mi sembra Rc2, che porta il re in mezzo all'arena, dove dovrebbe stare nel finale. Inoltre si potrebbe creare una situazione interessante e caotica dopo Td1. Siccome sono sotto di materiale, il caos dovrebbe essere mio amico. Mi aspetto Td8 con il nero che propone lo scambio di pedoni.

Penso che Stefano forse accetterà. Altra possibilità è Td1. Ma dopo a6 il pedone d6 sarebbe egualmente cancellato dalla scacchiera.
Siamo ad un momento del gioco che generalmente gioca a vantaggio di chi è in vantaggio. Infatti il bianco, privo di un pezzo, si trova a dover difendere la propria formazione delegando ai propri pezzi troppi compiti. In un finale un alfiere in grado di scorrazzare libero diventa una mina vagante.
Io personalmente opterei per lo scambio di pedoni. Un piccola speranza di far avanzare i propri pedoni sul lato di donna, tre contro uno, potrebbe riaccendere le tenui speranze del bianco.

On the other hand, had Dan developed that N to d7, the R would be free to move about.  And, the reason I draw that conclusion is because of just how important mobility is.  In this context, I think it's even more important because of how compromised the other wing is.  In other words, the K side is blocked up, completely, so my thinking is why compromise the Q side, at all?  Methinks that this ensures white a win.

In other words, it's a little bit quicker then what I thought earlier.  However, with best play from black, it still might take a while.

Or even something like 22.hxg6 Bxg6 23.Bh6, as now, black must do something to prevent a later Nh6+ where mate would not be far off.  So, after something like 23...Bd6 white can immediately play 24.Bg7+ which immediately wins back a R for B.  Or 24.Ng6+ which is a quicker and might be mate.

There will come times at this level of play in which quite complicated tactical situations can arise.  It is very hard to learn to recognise and take advantage of them without having begun with simpler, less complicated motifs and patterns.  The main thing to note is that the f7-knight is pinned by the bishop against the king.  It is defended by a rook and the king.  Could White heap another attacker against the pinned knight?  Yes she could: 17.Ne5!  Could Black in response find another defender?  Only the Queen.  What that means is that White looks to be winning the exchange after 17.Ne5.   ++++++++++++++  As it transpires, this might have led to a wild tactical melee as follows:  17.Ne5!

Myself, I would have decided that something like 17.Ne5 b5  18,Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Nxf7 Kxf7 won the exchange and left it at that.  I might well have been surprised by the tactical fight Black put up by 17...Bd6!  but 'them are the breaks'.

1.e4 g6
2.d4 Ag7

Pregio e difetto di questa apertura è la estrema varietà e mutevolezza (anche nel nome). Prende il nome dallo scacchista austriaco Karl Robatsch.

Presenta alcune analogie con la difesa Pirc, ma, a differenza di questa, il cavallo g8 non viene subito sviluppato in f6, anzi molto spesso entra in gioco da h6 o da e7, proprio per non chiudere la diagonale dell'Ag7. Di regola il Bianco occupa tutto il centro con i pedoni, avanzando a volte anche il pedone f2 in f4. Il Nero deve reagire energicamente per non essere soffocato. Per molto tempo la difesa moderna è stata considerata una difesa irregolare e solo nella seconda metà del XX secolo è stata studiata estesamente e giocata a tutti i livelli: il contributo più significativo alla sua diffusione è stata opera di alcuni fortissimi GM inglesi.

Varianti

Alcune linee di gioco sono:
3.Cc3 c6 4.f4 d5 5.e5 h5 (variante Gurgenidze)
3.Cc3 d6 4.Cf3 c6 5.Ae2 Cd7 6.0-0 Dc7 7.a4 Cgf6 8.Ae3 0-0 9.Dd2 a5 10.h3 Cb6 11.Tfe1 Ad7 (variante Suttles)
3.Cf3 d6 4.c3 Cd7 5.Ae2 e6 6.0-0 Ce7 (variante dell'ippopotamo)
3.f4 (variante 3 pedoni 
.
.

Ho trovato una annotazione di Alekhine che, commentando la Partita Lasker-Capablanca, a proposito di 1. ... g6, ha scritto ""Secondo i fondamenti teorici attuali, questa mossa non può essere considerata del tutto valida, in quanto il nero si vincola ad una particolare posizione senza essere in alcun modo in grado di ostacolare lo sviluppo centrale dell'avversario...""
Ai giorni nostri 1... g6 (chiamata difesa Moderna) è ritenuta un'apertura del tutto accettabile.
Con 1. ... g6, il nero diversamente da quanto prospettato da Alekhine, non rinuncia alla possibilità di giocare al centro; attende invece che sia il bianco a compromettersi per primo centralmente. Normalmente il contro gioco del nero prevede sia ... c5 sia ... e5, benchè in alcune linee il nero giochi ... d5.
Nella difesa moderna il nero dispone di più strategie. Questa libertà aggiuntiva implica per il nero un'ulteriore responsabilità; quella di condurre l'azione centrale in modo tempestivo e opportuno.
Se il nero indugia eccessivamente permettendo al bianco di consolidare la sua mossa sul entro, allora incorrerà nella difficoltà menzionata da Alekhine, ossia quella di non riuscire in nessun modo a contrarstare il centro bianco.

Curioso che l'ampia carrellata di varianti proposta da Klaus non includa una mossa che trovo interessante: Ch3, dopo h4, con presa di possesso delle caselle f4 e g5 e preparazione ad un attacco sul lato di re. Tale attacco può essere un diversivo; una delle caratteristiche di questa difesa è quella di consentire al nero un rapido cambiamento di fronte, mediante mosse come b5-b4 e la mobilità della regina dopo c6 ed e6.

Ora però propongo una piccola variante, c6, che chiamerei ""variante Norwood"" dal nome del GM autore del video che vi ho proposto. Tale mossa mi piace perché consente sia l'opposizione al centro del bianco tramite d5, sia un futuro attacco dal lato di donna con b5. È nello spirito della difesa Robatsch, che privilegia gli attacchi sulle colonne laterali, e il controllo più che il possesso delle caselle chiave. Mi aspetto f4 da parte di Klaus, alla quale risponderei con d5, ma non escludo una più tranquilla mossa di sviluppo, o la ficcante Ac4. "

Pe5 spegne, al momento, le velleità dell'alfiere camposcuro in g7 che è un po' il punto di forza di quest'apertura.

Secondo me stai già pensando ad un attacco basato su g4 e f5   in effetti questa variante della Robatsch consente sia al nero che al bianco di attaccare sulle colonne laterali, una volta bloccato il centro. A centro bloccato, il gioco diventa lento, strategico, e basato sul controllo delle caselle piuttosto che sul possesso. Perciò ci sta bene una mossa come h5, che prende possesso della casa g4, e prepara Ch6, Cf5 e Ag4. Quanto all'Ag7, ora è inattivo, ma dopo Ag4 ed e6, sfruttando lo ""slow chess"", si porterà in e7. Tutto questo Klaus permettendo   mi aspetto Cf3 o Ae3. "

Cf3 o Ad3 sono ambedue buone mosse, ma poiché la prima e la più usata, mi fido di coloro che hanno fatto esperienza più di me  

h5 giocata da Stefano è una mossa contemplata e consigliata nell'apertura che stiamo giocando. Fino a quando non l'avrò capita un po' meglio, non rischio colpi di testa... a quello ci pensa Stefano  
D'altronde negli scacchi, o si forza l'avversario all'errore (ma in questo caso il fattore tempo, causa primaria, gioca poco a favore di qualcuno di noi in quanto non ci sono orologi) o si aspetta l'errore. Appunto...
Penso che per il nero al momento sia importante sviluppare l'apertura per permettere al proprio Re di arroccare. Anche Af5 non sarebbe male, per bilanciare un po' il possesso del centro senza spostare e5 che bloccherebbe il gioco dell'alfiere nero.
Ambedue le mosse si equivalono. Vediamo cosa decide Stefano. "

Al ritorno di Klaus abbronzato, mi aspetto un'altra normale mossa di sviluppo tipo Ae3, e a quel punto penso che agiterò un po' le acque.
Quanto alle note di Klaus, ci sono varianti dell'apertura che non prevedono l'arrocco per il nero: infatti l'arrocco ha il difetto di spostare le torri dalla loro posizione di vasi per rampicanti...  . Af5 è interessante ma voglio ancora qualche mossa prima di decidere dove è meglio che vada l'alfiere. "

Ora voglio vedere se Stefano indugia a bloccare la conquista del centro da parte dei miei pezzi.
Mi aspetto l'arrocco corto o, ancor meglio, una scalata nella verticali di lato tipo a5. Anche Db6 non sarebbe male, ma obiettivamente, anche se mette sotto stress il mio lato di donna, mi impensierisce poco in quanto con Tb1 la cosa è risolta. "

Quanto a me, è ora di far vedere la specialità della Robatsch: i cambi di lato. Comincio con Db6: una toccata sul lato di donna, che può essere facilmente parata con Ca4 o con Tb1, ma la mia regina è molto mobile, e lo sarà ancora di più dopo e6.
Tra le due mosse del bianco non so quale preferire: Ca4 guadagna un tempo che perderà quando giocherò b5, Tb1 è tranquilla ma distoglie la torre bianca dalla colonna del rampicante 😉 "

Ora Stefano inizierà l'atteso logoramento ai fianchi. pa5 potrebbe essere una possibilità, se prima non decide per l'arrocco. Anche Ag4, prontamente contrastato da il mio Ae2 potrebbe essere una continuazione interessante. 
Non sono un esperto di questa apertura e pertanto mi affido all'istinto e ad una elaborazione, più semplificata possibile, della situazione sulla scacchiera. Obiettivamente sono un po' privo di idee che potrebbero aiutarmi a sfondare le posizioni del nero, ma, come al solito, giocherò contenendo le sue velleità che, a mio parere, giocando sui fianchi, cercherà di destabilizzare la mia formazione al momento così così   (non sono soddisfatto)

8. ... Cg4
9. Dd2 (per non rovinare l'arrocco) Cxe3
10. Dxe3
e a questo punto con Af4 costringo la regina bianca a muovere per la terza volta, mentre con Ag4 preludo a un apparentemente inevitabile impedonamento del bianco sulla colonna f (per salvare il pedone d4, mentre Ce2 perde il pedone a2). Davvero versatile la Robatsch!

Per lo scopo di questa partita, però, preferisco rimanere sul tracciato classico. Perciò gioco la rampicante mossa di sviluppo Ag4, alla quale il bianco risponderà con Ae2 per liberare la regina dal 'pin'

La mossa che mi infastidisce maggiormente è la possibile Cf5. Una posizione decisamente di predominanza per il nero che farà retrpcedere il mio Alfiere campo-scuro.
Forse qualcuno penserà che logica ci sia di giocare una partita dove i due avversari si comunicano le loro idee. Ricordo che stiamo solo cercando di far comprendere quali idee sobillino la mente di uno scacchista prima di muovere e che tutto questo epistolario è intentato solo a coinvolgere e, nel possibile, insegnare a qualche interessato i rudimenti principali di un'apertura e il conseguente medio-gioco.

Se avessi di fronte un giocatore inesperto potrei provarla per vedere se il mio avversario, messo sotto pressione, commette un errore. Ma naturalmente non è il caso   e allora gioco subito AxCf3, che sarà seguita da DxAf3 e da Cf5.

Presumo che poi Klaus metterà al sicuro l'alfiere in f2, ma effettivamente il mio cavallo in f5 è in una posizione dominante. Il pedone d4 non è in pericolo, per ora; la variante:

14. Ce2 Db4+

Cf5, come prospettato, è una mossa molto incisiva.
Non devo lasciare l'iniziativa a Stefano che, a quanto pare, conosce bene questa apertura che, sinceraente, io non ho mai usato, optando per la similare Pirc.

Preferisco continuare lo sviluppo, consolidare la struttura dei pedoni, preparare Af8 che mi consentirà di spostare l'alfiere sui due lati. Come detto in precedenza, sarà una partita strategica e posizionale. Il cavallo in f5, in tal senso, controlla più che minacciare.

Ora Klaus si trova, secondo me, in seri dubbi: Ad3 è una buona mossa di sviluppo e minaccia il mio wondercavallo, ma toglie la casella d3 alla regina, e allora potrei davvero decidere di prendere il pedone d4; Ce2 permette l'ottima mossa c3, ma allontana un altro difensore dal lato di donna; Ca4 perde inutilmente un tempo dopo Db4+; g4 finisce con scambio di torri e regina bianca in castigo in h1... nelle partite posizionali, si dedica molta energia a minare il possibile gioco dell'avversario.

Da una parte c'è un sentiero tranquillo, dall'altra una mulattiera tra i dirupi.

Se invece il bianco non prende ne avanza con il pedone g4, allora mi si crea qualche imbarazzo (ad esempio Ad3). h5xg4 porta allo scambio di torri menzionato in seguito, con il cavallo posizionato un po' peggio.
La strada impervia è quella tracciata da Klaus come sconveniente per il nero. In realtà il giudizio di Klaus mi lascia perplesso; infatti dopo lo scambio di torri seguito da Dxh1 Ch6, supponendo che il bianco voglia aprirsi subito la colonna h con g5 seguito da Cf5, ecco che la donna è libera di scorrazzare per la colonna h, ma... a fare che? Il re nero potrebbe essere minacciato solo dall'intervento a supporto della torre, o dell’alfiere camposcuro, che sono molto laboriosi; la regina da sola non può fare granché, perché io non ho intenzione di arroccare; il mio alfiere è bloccato, ma la regina Bianca è lontanissima dall'azione, e nel cambio ci guadagno. Al bianco conviene, quasi quasi, Dh3, per posizionarsi sulla riga libera, ma se la regina dovesse intervenire sul lato di donna, il pedone g è in presa. Meglio allora Dh4, che però non minaccia nulla.

Ora aspetto che Stefano si decida a muove un pedone sul lato di donna. E' da un po' che l'aspetto questa mossa, già promessa per tener fede allo spirito di questa apertura. Resta ancora valida anche Ca6.
Lasciamoci sorprendere

Ora che tocca a me, vedo che nel mio universo ci sono solo tre elettroni: a5, b5 e Ca6. Siccome voglio fare tutte e tre queste mosse, non resta che scegliere l'ordine, in modo che Klaus non me le possa impedire. O in modo che io stesso non me le impedisca; Ca6 impedisce a5, per esempio. Ci sono altre due mosse più sottili: b6 e Cd7. Soprattutto quest'ultima mi può tornare utile, seguite il mio ragionamento. Dopo b5, il cavallo bianco potrebbe andare in c5, rendendo possibile uno scambio di cavalli in a6 o in d7. Siccome il mio cavallo mi sembra più cruciale di quello di Klaus, per la mia manovra di attacco, non voglio questo scambio.
Perciò comincerei con a5, quale seguirebbe prevedibilmente a3 (b4xa5 manco a parlarne, c3 taglia la strada del ritorno al cavallo); poi seguirebbe Cd7, in modo da poter muovere Cb6 se il bianco muove Cd5 senza rischiare lo scambio, e poi poter spostare il cavallo in c4, casella dalla quale non può essere sloggiato se non sacrificando l'alfiere buono. Queste mosse di cavallo, avverranno prima o dopo b7-b5, a seconda dei casi.

Avevo detto b4xa5 manco a parlarne? Guardate questa variante:

La carica di Krojanty o battaglia di Krojanty è stata una carica di cavalleria polacca durante la campagna di Polonia operata da parte delle truppe naziste impegnate nell'occupazione del territorio polacco, nella seconda guerra mondiale. La campagna (1º settembre 1939 – 5 ottobre 1939) è culminata con la resa delle ultime forze polacche, al termine della quale, dopo circa quattro settimane di combattimenti, ebbe inizio la seconda guerra mondiale. il 1º settembre a Krojanty il 18º reggimento di Ulani carica di sorpresa e disperde elementi del 76º reggimento di fanteria appartenente alla 20ª divisione motorizzata delle forze naziste.
Cavalleria polacca durante la battaglia del fiume Bzura

Durante l'invasione la cavalleria polacca effettuò un totale di 16 cariche nel tentativo di arrestare l'avanzata tedesca; qui i nazisti poterono sperimentare e mettere appunto la moderna tecnologia offerta dai carri armati, dagli aerei e dalle radiocomunicazioni, allo scopo di creare una nuova modalità di guerra caratterizzata dall'uso combinato di nuove forze di attacco. La campagna del 1939 rappresenta l'esempio dell'efficacia dell'informazione mediatica utilizzata per svolgere la propaganda riguardo l'efficienza delle proprie forze, oltre che allo scopo di screditare la capacità difensiva del nemico. Essa difatti fu il primo esempio del un nuovo metodo di condurre la guerra, per la quale gli strateghi di Berlino coniarono il termine ""Blitzkrieg"", (guerra lampo), dove le forze tedesche tentarono di annientare con azioni fulminee, l'esercito poco addestrato e male organizzato nemico.

La mia mossa è:

21. c4 e così facciamo traballare il centro del nero e metto pressione sul Re appostato in d8. Nemmeno la prossima Ab4+ con successiva 22. Rd1 scalfisce il mio vantaggio. Forse una esame approfondito di Stefano mi darà ragione, o no  ? "

Per la cronaca fece una brutta fine, ma salvò l'onore.

Mi aspettavo, peraltro, la manovra di Klaus per destabilizzare il centro, bloccato praticamente dall'inizio della partita. Ad ogni manovra verso il centro, però, può corrispondere una insidia sui lati; E questo il concetto base della Robatsch. Pertanto non gioco Ab4+, che avrebbe solo l'effetto di mettere il re bianco dove vuole già andare, cioè in d1 (per consentire Tc1 senza timori). Gioco Cb4; mi sembra una buona mossa, mette in presa il pedone a2, e consente la risposta Cxd5 a cxd5, mettendo il cavallo nero a fare il pedone supplente per tenere bloccato il centro, ma in una posizione insidiosa per il bianco, con il pedone f4 in presa. cxd5 mi sembra la risposta più logica da parte del bianco; De2, l'unica altra mossa che difende entrambi i pedoni a2 e c4, entrambi insidiati, non va affatto bene per il bianco, chi rischia fortemente di perdere il pedone g4. c5 porta a Cxa2, ma dopo Cb6 e Ta7 I pericoli per il nero mi sembrano finiti.

Forse Stefano ha ragione sul mio eccessivo ottimismo. Mi scuso per aver venduto l'orso prima di averlo nel sacco (lo diceva anche Trapattoni  ). Logicamente sono molto ottimista sulla mia attuale situazione sulla scacchiera. Resto convinto del ritardo del nero nel contrastare l'attacco al centro. Ora il Re nero deve cercare di togliersi dalla diagonale della sua Donna. L'alfiere in f2 pazientemente aspetta di balzare in b6, logicamente prima il Pd4 deve spostarsi.

A questo punto è facile notare, secondo il mio modesto giudizio, che l'arrocco lungo, che mi sembrava di aver prospettato alcune mosse fa, arebbe sicuramente aiutato Stefano.

- lasciare il mio cavallo in b4, in modo che se il bianco fa c4xd5, allora Cxd5 e 'pedone supplente' (e mia regina su colonna libera)
- contrastare l'avanzata del pedone c.
Perciò muovo b7-b6, e se la risposta è c5, allora scambio bxc e cxd (presumo) e poi Tb8 che mette in presa l'alfiere in b5 e protegge b6 dall'altro alfiere. ."

Sono andato un pochino più avanti con 25. Ac6 Da6+ 26. Rg1 Tb8 e non mi pare che, dopo d6, ci sia il modo ragionevole di impedire che il pedone d vada a regina, con matto in poche mosse.

Commento di Klaus
---------------------------------
Speravo che la partita durasse più a lungo, ma qualche mossa innovativa di Stefano ha accorciato le gambe alla partita.

Poiché, come è stato detto in precedenza, lo scopo finale di questi threads non è quello di vincere o perdere una partita, ma di interessare i più a scopo di insegnamento, penso che dovremmo in seguito evitare, almeno per la prima parte della partita, mosse non contemplate nella normale apertura.

Spero che i più abbiano capito come la partita Moderna-Robatch, pur portando come fine il logoramento ai lati della formazione bianca, sia facilmente contrastabile se il bianco blocca le iniziative del nero e mantiene solido il centro.

Certamente, se l'avessi giocata contro un GM o latri ossi duri, non sarei riuscito ad arrivare al finale giocato e, probabilmente mi avrebbe fatto fare la fine del topo, ma questa è un'altra storia  

Insegnamento: giochiamo aperture semplici se ci sentiamo più sicuri.
