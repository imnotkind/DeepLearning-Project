5,0,5,1Ne1,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p1p4/2pPp3/4P3/3P2P1/PP1Q1PBP/R3NRK1 b - -',This is where my middle game went a little soft. I wanted to swing my knight to the queen side for some reason.
6,0,6,1Nc2,b'r4rk1/pb1qb1pp/1p1p4/2pPpp2/4P2P/3P2P1/PPNQ1PB1/R4RK1 b - -',Taking would be bad here. I will not mess up my pawn structure so the pawn can push all he wants

9,0,9,c4,b'r4rk1/p2qb1pp/b2p4/Np1Pp3/2p1P2P/3P2P1/PP1Q2B1/R4RK1 w - -',Thought about taking but his white diagonal is too strong. Will let him take separate those pawns

11,0,11,2a4,b'2r2rk1/p2q2pp/bbNp4/1p1Pp3/P3P2P/1P1Q2P1/6BK/R4R2 b - a3',Here I'm hoping he takes with the pawn. It would reveal my queen and allow me to take his unprotected white bishop

13,0,13,2axb5,b'2r2rk1/pq4pp/b1Np4/1P1Pp3/3bP2P/1P1Q2P1/R5BK/5R2 b - -',I spent at least 2 minutes on this move. Figured it to work out to equal exchange at the very least. I considered pushing the pawn up as well but I thought I might need that square as a post for the knight at some point. I'm sure with more time and calculation a better move could be made but an even exchange seemed ok
14,0,14,2Rxf8+,b'2r2Rk1/Rq4pp/2Np4/3Pp3/3bP2P/1P1b2P1/6BK/8 b - -',Necessary to trade rooks too. Otherwise I lose the exchange
15,0,15,3Rxb7,b'5rk1/1R4pp/2Np4/3Pp3/3bP2P/1P1b2P1/6BK/8 b - -',And there we are equal exchange. He definitely has positional advantage with the bishop pair breathing down my king's neck. Also with the board opening up bishop pairs are dominate over knights.
16,0,16,3Rf2,b'6k1/1R4pp/2Np4/3Pp3/3bP2P/1P1b2P1/5rBK/8 w - -',Wasn't scared of this at the time. Should have been though

18,0,18,3Rxd6,b'6k1/6pp/2NR4/3Pp3/3bb2P/1P4P1/5rBK/8 b - -',I did not feel the need to panic though. I do not see mate for my king and the bishop is lost accept it.

20,0,20,3Ng4+,b'3R4/6pp/5k2/3P4/4b1NP/1P4PK/5br1/8 b - -',Alright. I definitely want to trade cause those black pawns are key
21,0,21,3b4,b'8/6pp/3R4/3P3k/1P2b2P/6PK/5r2/8 b - -',Feeling good about the end game. I don't think he has mate anywhere

23,0,23,Kxh4,b'8/6pp/3R4/3P4/1P4bk/5r2/6K1/8 w - -',So much for protecting those pawns
24,0,24,4Rc6,b'8/6pp/2R5/3P4/1P4bk/5r2/6K1/8 b - -',Idea here is to get my pawn off the white square and moving up.

161,8,0,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I have picked up the Tarrasch as white in the French as I feel it offers white better chances since it allows the pawn to move to c3. Plus it avoids the Winawer which has some annoying and somewhat drawish lines. 
162,8,1,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',?! Allows white to transpose. As black ended up exchanging on e4 next move now would have been the time to do it in the Rubenstein.
163,8,2,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',In my mind the most flexible response. With the black knight on d7 there's no doubt that the white bishop belongs on d3 since there is no way to harass it. 
164,8,3,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',When I used to play the Rubenstein I found that b6 early on weakened the light squares considerably. Moves like Ngf6 or Be7 are more common to strike at the center.
165,8,4,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PNB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Aiming to discourage c5. Black has little control of the center at the moment and this seals both of his breaks: e5 and c5 at least for the moment. Maybe not the best square for the bishop but it can be moved later when I know where it belongs.
166,8,5,Nf3,b'r2qkbnr/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PNB2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The computer recommends Qf3!? here with the threat of Nf6+ ... Qxb7 to weaken the light squares on the queenside even more. However Nf3 surely cannot be bad and as shown later in the game maybe the queen belongs elsewhere.
167,8,6,Nd5,b'r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PNB2/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Simply begging for a later c4.

169,8,8,1O-O,b'r1q1kb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Perhaps c4 ... d5 would have been good but after O-O and Re1 white is undoubtedly ready to attack

Re1 is solid and allows for more aggressive play since Black cannot escape the center anyways. The intention of the move is to stop Ng5xe6 sacrifices but it is way too slow right now. Black probably should have just played Be7 and dealt with sacrifices when they happened.
171,8,10,1Rad1,b'r1q1k2r/pbpnbpp1/1p2p2p/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/3RR1K1 b kq -',?! Missing the opportunity to seize the initiative with c4 ... d5. One of my only inaccuracies the whole game.

174,8,13,1Nc3,b'r1q2rk1/pbpnbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/2PP4/2NB1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',!? The knight is better placed on c3 where it aims at b5 and d5 and vacates the e-file for the queen and rook increasing the power of d5.
175,8,14,Bd8,b'r1qbr1k1/pbpn1pp1/1p2pn1p/1N6/2PP4/3B1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',?! Not like the bishop was on a stellar square on e7 but d8 really diminishes all power the bishop has and begins to block in other pieces.
176,8,15,1d5,b'r1qbr1k1/pbpn1pp1/1p2pn1p/1N1P4/2P5/3B1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',!? Best to play before it's too late. White's pieces are much more active and are more ready to exploit the open center should black accept this.
177,8,16,1exd5,b'r1qbr1k1/pbpn1pp1/1p3n1p/1N1p4/2P5/3B1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Note that 17. Qxe8+ Nxe8 18. Rxe8+ Nf8 has chances for white but being down the queen for the rook + minor piece is a tough exchange to get compensation for.
178,8,17,1Qc2,b'r1qbr1k1/pbpn1pp1/1p3n1p/1N1p4/2P5/3B1NB1/PPQ2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',! The best place for the queen allowing the rooks to ravage the e-file and Black's last active pieces: the e8 rook and the f6 knight.
179,8,18,1a6,b'r1qbr1k1/1bpn1pp1/pp3n1p/1N1p4/2P5/3B1NB1/PPQ2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',? Rxe1 is the only move that keeps black's activity
180,8,19,1Nc3,b'r1qbn1k1/1bpn1pp1/pp5p/3p4/2P5/2NB1NB1/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Note that the d5 pawn was never lost as if 19...dxc4? 20. Bf5 wins back much more than the pawn. So technically speaking for temporarily being a pawn down white has de-activated all of black's pieces and activated all of his own.
181,8,20,1c6,b'r1qbn1k1/1b1n1pp1/ppp4p/3p4/2P5/2NB1NB1/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',My improvement would be Nef6 to at least try to minimize the power of Bf5

185,8,24,2Qd3,b'r3n1k1/1bqn1pp1/ppp4p/3P1B2/8/2NQ1NP1/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',Threatening to push the d-pawn or to capture on c6. Also relieving the knight of the pin on the c-file after cxd5.

The queen can now take mine AND leave me in check leaving me with no initiative whatsoever. I don't see any tricks swindles exchanges or checks that could POSSIBLY give me back what I lost. And the player is above 1900 which means it is highly unlikely for him to blunder at all. So I decide to call the game as a lost cause and resign. Would you have resigned in this case?

246,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I like to open with 1. e4 as white.  It stakes out central space and opens a line for my light squared bishop and queen to develop.  
247,11,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French defense is quite unfamiliar to me even though it is one I should know.
248,11,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My first mistake already.  I fail to recognize what needs to be done against the French defense.  What is black up to?  What should white be doing?  White had an opportunity to build a large center (pawns on d4 and e4) and should have done so.  I am so used to other openings where 2. Nf3 is appropriate that I honestly played it without really thinking the position through.  What I should have considered is black's intention of attacking the e4 square.  Watch my lack of options in the next moves.
249,11,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',This is the reason 2. Nf3 is not what I should have played.  Now I can not play 3. d4 gaining central space since it drops the e-pawn.  Defending the e-pawn with 3. d3 is very passive for white as it blocks in the light squared bishop....the logic behind 1. e4 is to open that diagonal so it is counterproductive to close it unless that is the only option.  I didn't like 3. Nc3 to defend the e-pawn because of 3...d4 can remove the defender.  As it turns out I don't think 3. Nc3 is too bad here.  If black does push the d-pawn with 3....d4 4. Nb5 gets the attacked knight to safety (for the moment) and attacks the d4 square a 2nd time (both knights hit the square) and is only defended by the queen.  This pawn for black may prove to be overextended later in the game and the pressure on white's e4 pawn is gone.  
250,11,4,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I make a bad choice here (2 poor moves out of 3 already).  Why is it so bad?  Consider black's position after the recapture 3...exd5.  Black has central space and open lines for both of its bishops to develop to.  Before white captured on d5 with 3. exd5 black had a problem to solve....how to develop the light squared bishop?  White just fixed that problem for black with 3. exd5.
251,11,5,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black has already at least equalized.  
252,11,6,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',During the game I didn't realize how badly I played on moves 2 and 3.  It's only now looking back that I see it.  Good lesson for me.  Remember white should strive to build a large center and do everything possible to maintain it in the opening if black allows.
253,11,7,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black fights for the e5 square and develops a piece (all thoughts on the center and development in the opening).  
254,11,8,Bd3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White does the same.  Develop and fight for the e4 square.
255,11,9,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black develops supports the d5 point controls the e4 square a 2nd time and makes room to castle short.

257,11,11,c4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/2PP4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - c3',I decided to push the c-pawn out two squares before developing my queenside pieces.  If I play 7. Nc3 my c-pawn is immobilized and my opponent can pin my f3 knight with 7. Bg4.  I feel like 7. c4 gives me flexibility in development.
258,11,12,Bxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/8/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',This keeps material even and pins the f7 pawn.  My d-pawn is isolated (no friendly pawns on adjacent files) and on a half open file of my opponent.  I will need to generate activity and avoid minor piece exchanges (this is what the owner of an isolated pawn should be thinking) or move 7. c4 will prove to be incorrect.

Bg5 pinning the f6 knight but did not want minor piece exchanges with an isolated pawn.  9....h6 puts the question to my bishop which I do not wish to part with so 9. Bg5 does not seem best here.  9.  Nbd2 immobilizes my dark squared bishop so Nc3 seems like the way to go.  Develop a minor piece and fight for the central light squares d5 and e4.

I felt my opponent would respond with 10...Be6 and I could exchange knight for bishop with 11.

During the game my sense of danger about Bh2+ was constantly in the back of my mind.  The black queen has an x-ray attack along the d-file....that is something I missed all the time when I was working my way up through the rating levels (especially with rooks).  An x-ray attack (my understanding of it anyway) is when a linear piece's influence is being blocked by another piece (the linear piece sees right through the blocking piece hence x-ray).....once that blocking piece moves the linear piece's attack reigns down on the opponent position.  This is especially dangerous when the blocking piece can deliver check on that move.

265,11,19,1Bg4,b'r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/2nb1n2/6N1/2BP2b1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I missed this move!!!  Why I missed it I have no idea.  Maybe because I thought f3 would block the light squared bishop (and attack it at the same time forcing it to move).  What I failed to consider was once it steps back to Bh5 it now protects the f7 square!!!
266,11,20,Bh5,b'r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/2nb1n2/6Nb/2BP4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',"Ugh.  My foolishly optimistic attack on black's f7 square is stopped.  That would be fine if my pieces were well placed.  Here comes the advice I have read at least twenty times in various chess improvement books (but fail to listen to way too often).  ""No cheap tricks!!!.  Assume your opponent will find the best move to defend the position.  Only choose plans that improve your position not ones that rely on your opponent to make a mistake.""  So are my pieces well placed at this point?  NO!!! My king is unsafe (the f2 pawn no longer blocks the g2-a7 diagonal and does not defend the g3 or e3 squares anymore) my bishop on c4 is hanging (undefended) my knight on g5 is into enemy territory and only one decent escape square (2 if you count the h3 square but that is a terrible location for a knight to go to) my d-pawn is hanging (it is technically undefended at the moment since my queen is tied to the defense of my e1 rook) and my dark squared bishop is undeveloped.  That is a lot of problems to solve so this was a terrible opening for white and amazing for black.  During the game I knew my position was quite bad because I was able to identify all of those problems.  My next move attempts to solve two of the problems but fails terribly."
267,11,21,1Be3,b'r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/2nb1n2/6Nb/2BP4/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I thought developing the bishop was the way to go here.  It defended the d4 pawn developed the bishop and allowed my queen to move since the other rook could now defend the e1 rook.  I felt good about it.  
268,11,22,1Rxe3,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/6Nb/2BP4/2N1rP2/PP4PP/R2QR1K1 w - -',My heart sank when I saw this move.  What a beautiful tactic (decoy) my opponent came up with.  I never considered this in my analysis.  Another important piece of chess advice to learn here.  Before considering possible moves (candidate moves) calculate ALL possible checks and captures the opponent can make.  Even if the check or capture looks ridiculous calculate the lines anyway. It is possible that a tactic called a decoy is being used......decoy is dragging a piece to a square that will result in mate or bigger losses than were sacrificed.  
269,11,23,1Rxe3,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/6Nb/2BP4/2N1RP2/PP4PP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Do you see it now?  Black sacrificed the exchange (rook with a trading value of 5 pawns for a bishop trading value of 3 pawns) to decoy my rook onto a square that will lead to worse losses for me 14....Bf4 attacks both the rook and the knight.  That would be fine if the rook could safely move to a square that defends the hanging knight but the e5 square belongs to black. Obviously the knight can not move anywhere that will defend the rook.  There is one option that might look promising at first....15. Nxf7 would at least take a pawn down with the knight since the knight attacks the queen from there however remember another major problem of my position from earlier.  My king is unsafe!!!  Black can respond to 15. Nxf7 with 15...Bxe3!! ignoring the attack on the queen since white is forced to move the king out of check.    
270,11,24,1Bf4,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/6Nb/2BP1b2/2N1RP2/PP4PP/R2Q2K1 w - -',I deserved this for violating important opening chess principles and underestimating the defensive resourcefulness of my opponent.  
271,11,25,Bxg5,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/6bb/2BP4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R2QR1K1 w - -',This does not appear quite as bad as it really is to some players so let me explain a little.  White is down a pawn if you count the trading value of pieces so that seems troublesome but not completely lost as I think this position really is.  The true trading value of knights and bishops is really closer to 3.25 rather than 3 but players don't learn this until a little further into their chess development.  The bishop pair (one player has both bishops and the other does not) makes the combined trading value of the bishops closer to 7 (3.5 each).  Therefore the reality of this position is worse than down 1 pawn.....it is much closer to down 2 pawns maybe even more due to other factors.  My king is forever less safe than black's my isolated d-pawn will eventually fall since black has more pieces that can attack it than I have to defend it and black has no central pawns to limit the mobility of his bishops.  My position is full of dark squared holes which black's knights will eventually exploit.

That is how one should play chess.  17. Qe2 attacks the e7 knight for a 2nd time.  Black hangs the knight if 17....Nexd5.  Why?  Because of black's weak back rank.  Let's look at the line.  17....Nexd5 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Bxd5....it looks like black will be up a pawn but wait....if 19....Qxd5 20. Qe8+ Rxe8 21. Rxe8#.  The result is the same if 17....Nfxe5.  Black has a couple of reasonable defenses left...Ne8 Nd7 Nc8 or Kf8.  What is wrong with 17...Nf5?  The pawn fork 18. g4.  My guess is 17....Nc8 even though it looks scary for a second.  Back rank mate is covered by the f6 knight though and black's next play is Nd6 blockading the d-pawn and covering the e8 square a 2nd time.  Black will easily reorganize and white's temporary initiative will be easily solved.  I could have played on for a while hoping for a blunder from my opponent but I prefer getting to sharing and hopefully helping the team.

17. Qf3 (que resultaria na queda do peão c2 formando um final de peões que levaria a uma vitória fácil para as pretas) ou
17. Rb3 (sacrificando a torre branca em troca do meu incômodo bispo preto o que de qualquer forma me daria também uma vantagem decisiva no fim de jogo).

Esse exemplo apesar de longe de ser uma partida bem jogada (pois desde a abertura ambos os jogadores cometeram vários deslizes) ilustra alguns conceitos importantes do xadrez como por exemplo a importância de se ter um conhecimento mínimo da abertura (o que nesse caso nenhum dos dois jogadores tinha) e também o conceito do desenvolvimento - ou seja a necessidade de se desenvolver rapidamente as peças menores (cavalos e bispos) e rocar o mais cedo possível (regras desrespeitadas pelas brancas quando elas jogaram h3 por exemplo). Aqui você pode me perguntar: se o roque é tão importante porque as pretas não rocaram? Simples: porque não precisaram pois as brancas ao decidir não rocar se colocaram em uma posição vulnerável sendo obrigadas a se defender - e as pretas não desperdiçaram tempo e atacaram com todas as suas forças. E obviamente enquanto as pretas estavam atacando seu rei não corria perigo.
O jogo mostra também quão poderosa é a rainha (como as pretas mostraram no início) e o quão vulnerável é a rainha (quando precisa fugir das peças menores como foi o lamentável caso da rainha branca)."

It is pesky really and the only way to avoid it is to move pawn to A6 earlier but the book more or less says not to worry about it and let it play out.  I guess. In a real FD and not a CK mutation game one would trade off LS bishops here and white has in a way helped black by getting rid of the bishop that would otherwise be trapped and prevent a Queenside castle if needed later.

White has alsoand more importantly uncastled himself needlessly. It would have been to his advantage I think to have stayed tucked in and developed his attack more. But it can be a compulsion I think to keep attacking and checking the other guy for some players. And do not think it cannot work it can.

Letting his castle crumble too early on and allowing me long range shots ( like move 36) were strategic errors that can be hard to see at time because one is trying to just attack something somewhere.

I guess most players in the range I play (1250 to 1500) recognize the line as I do now and know if they block or eliminate white's LS bishop the basic line is rendered useless. There are no doubt other variations but I do not have the time and skill to study chess that deeply really. So this game was not to be a Stonewall game and I think was I trying to go for a Spanish game when I opened with E4 as that I what I like to explore lately. But you will see it ended up resembling a board you might well see in a classic Stonewall Attack game.

Not a perfect book set up but I recall things looking this way. Of course one does not have to play something just like it goes in a book example to arrive at a similar board.

I am not confident but as long as I am in slightly charted waters I am a little okay.

The analysis suggests rook to F4 attacking the knight and getting it out to where I want it to be anyway.

My Opponent isn't very good and I know a fair amount of chess so I have a clear advantage in that department.  I still make dumb mistakes and don't see everything though so I am putting this game up so that I can get some advice.  Also I make a pretty huge blunder and come back successfully due to my opponent making many mistakes.  Any pointers will help so please comment.

I have more control of the center and queenside and most of my minor pieces are developed.  Also My major pieces are beginning to develop as well.  Hindsight tells me that I should've played Nc6 first before castling or captured the lone pawn on g5 but I felt like playing it safe.

Moving the queen or playing Re8 would've been so much better.  However I was still far ahead and what good is it being a queen up if you don't have yours in an advantageous position.

863,37,18,Re7,b'6k1/b1p1rppp/p1b5/8/PP3B2/3P3B/2N5/3Q1K2 w - -',I quickly lose the momentum I just got back but my opponents lack of development hurts him since he can't easily take advantage of it.
864,37,19,h6,b'2B3k1/b1p1rpp1/p1b4p/8/PP3B2/3P4/2N5/3Q1K2 w - -',My opponent clearly is trying to focus on my queenside pawns which I admit are very vulnerable.  I take advantage of it by developing my kingside pawns.  Once again my pawn game isn't the best so I don't know if h6 was the best move for this.

872,37,27,h5,b'8/5pk1/Bb3rb1/6pp/1Q6/8/8/3NK3 w - -',At this point my opponent is playing cat and mouse but he should really be focusing on defending against my pawns.

878,37,33,5g2,b'8/5pk1/5r2/1B5b/7Q/8/5bp1/2KN4 w - -',I threaten to promote my pawn and by now it is unstoppable as the bishop is defending the queening square.
879,37,34,5Nxf2,b'8/5pk1/5r2/1B5b/7Q/8/5Np1/2K5 b - -',Of the two captures available this is the worst.  Now not only do I promote my pawn but it also puts his king in check.  Qxh5 would still let me queen my pawn but this move lets me get momentum as well.
880,37,35,5Kb2,b'8/5pk1/5r2/1B5b/7Q/8/1K3N2/6q1 b - -',Nd1 would have been better.  It is all downhill from here for my opponent.

I have been studying the difference between analysis and evaluation.  Analysis is calculating the material left after all the possible lines while evaluation is looking at the position after the captures are over.

926,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A opening move I'm quite accustomed to the King's Pawn Opening.
927,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is always my response to King's Pawn the King's Pawn Game.
928,39,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White plays the Bishop's Opening. I already know white is planning to see if I fall for the 'checkmate in three moves' strategy but I never fall for that anymore.
929,39,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I respond with another move I'm popular with the Bishop's Opening Berlin Defence which pretty much ruins any hope for a checkmate on f7. 
930,39,4,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This is not a opening in the book so the book ends early. 
931,39,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black pulls out the other knight. 
932,39,6,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Another common move. This either usually ends in a bishop knight exchange or white retreats the bishop.
933,39,7,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',I open myself up for castling king-side. 
934,39,8,h6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbpp1/2n2n1p/4p1B1/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Moment of truth...
935,39,9,Bh4,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbpp1/2n2n1p/4p3/2B1P2B/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',...and white retreats the bishop. 
936,39,10,g5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbp2/2n2n1p/4p1p1/2B1P2B/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq g6',Another common move I make. I want to drive back the bishop further. 
937,39,11,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbp2/2n2n1p/4p1p1/2B1P3/3P1NB1/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Normally this is a good move. You castle and protect your king further. Computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I couldn't understand this at first but it didn't take me long to see why. There are 2 white pieces focused on the black e5 pawn but only 1 black piece focused on the pawn. The result will be a +1 material point advantage for white. Although not much of a advantage it is still an advantage.  
938,39,12,Bxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbp2/5n1p/4B1p1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',Black now has a small advantage but being so small I was not worried. 
939,39,13,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/4B1p1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',After what I saw earlier I expected white to retreat his bishop again.
940,39,14,1Bc3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/6p1/2B1P3/2BP4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',I was quite correct. 
941,39,15,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/6p1/2B1P1b1/2BP4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Yet another popular move by black. I bring my bishop out to attack the queen and the bishop is protected by the knight. Of course white will protect it. 
942,39,16,1Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/6p1/2B1P1b1/2BP4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',I was actually expecting white to play 11. f3 but this move works to. 
943,39,17,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bp2/5n1p/3p2p1/2B1P1b1/2BP4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',I bring a strong attack that involves my knight and queen. It's not likely though that I would get a material advantage. 
944,39,18,1Bd4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bp2/7p/3n2p1/2BB2b1/3P4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',I'm not surprised white didn't play 13. Bxd5 but why Bd4 when white could castle? The computer analysis does view this as a mistake and that a king-side castle was the best move. 
945,39,19,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bp2/2p4p/3n2p1/2BB2b1/3P4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',I decide to protect my knight just in case white does decide to attack. I did not see a possible advantage though. 13. ... Nf4 14. Be5 Nxg2+ 15. Kf1 ... This sequence would of not only gave me back my material advantage but also would give me an advantage in position on the board but again I missed the opportunity. 
946,39,20,1Nc3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bp2/2p4p/3n2p1/2BB2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White responds with a stronger attack on the black knight. This is an inaccuracy by the computer analysis and that a king-side castle was again the best move. 
947,39,21,1Bb4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/2p4p/3n2p1/1bBB2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I still do not see the advantage I could gain and I instead attack the knight just brought out by white. No surprise that the computer analysis views this as a mistake and that Nf4 was again the best move. 
948,39,22,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/2p4p/3n2p1/1bBB2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White now castles and any immediate advantage for black was lost. 
949,39,23,1Nb6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/1bBB2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',With this move I hope to attack white's DSB on d4 with my queen. I expect white to of course protect it for white clearly sees his bishops as assets.
950,39,24,1Rae1,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/1bBB2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',??? What happened to something like Be3 or Bxb6? White was clearly focusing on a attack and did not realize that his d4 bishop was wide open to black's queen. This will result in a good +2 advantage for black. Computer analysis views this as a blunder and that Bxb6 was the best move.
951,39,25,1Qxd4,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/1bBq2b1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black also has a pretty good position on the board along with the material advantage but white's is pretty exceptional to.
952,39,26,1Qe3,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/1bBq2b1/2NPQ3/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Well not the best move. Computer analysis views this as an inaccuracy and that Re4 was the best move. Very true for then white would threaten both the queen and the g4 bishop thus likely retaking a small material advantage. This current move threatens a queen exchange but I am not willing to exchange queens but I did have plans to attack white's knight. 
953,39,27,1Bxc3,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/2Bq2b1/2bPQ3/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',I follow through with my plan.
954,39,28,1bxc3,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1np4p/6p1/2Bq2b1/2PPQ3/P1P2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',White takes the bishop and does not offer a queens exchange. 
955,39,29,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1npq3p/6p1/2B3b1/2PPQ3/P1P2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Here in my view at the time I felt black was lining up for a strong attack which was not really true but I felt falling back was a good idea. Not really.After looking at the board in my view I should of attacked the c3 pawn thus giving me more of an advantage. In the computer analysis's views though this move is a mistake and that Qxe3 was the best move. Although I do not favor a queens exchange it was the best move. This sequence may of followed and left black with more of an advantage:  19. Rxe3 Nxc4 20. dxc4 Rfe8 21. Rg3 Be2 22. Rb1 Bxc4 23. h4 f6 24. Rxb7 Bxa2 25. hxg5 fxg5 26. f4 Re1+ 27. Kh2 Re2 28. fxg5. It also would be putting white in a bad position on the board but this did not happen so the game will play out differently. 
956,39,30,1h3,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1npq3p/6p1/2B3b1/2PPQ2P/P1P2PP1/4RRK1 b - -',An attack on black's bishop. 
957,39,31,1Nxc4,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/2pq3p/6p1/2n3b1/2PPQ2P/P1P2PP1/4RRK1 w - -',I give white an option here bishop or knight. Obviously knight since it threatens white's queen.
958,39,32,2Qe7,b'r4rk1/pp2Qp2/2pq3p/6p1/2n3b1/2PP3P/P1P2PP1/4RRK1 b - -',White pushes for a queens exchange. Normally I would reject but seeing my b7 pawn threatened by his queen along with white getting deep in my territory I would decide to go ahead. Computer analysis views this move as a blunder and that dxc4 was the best move. hxg4 probably was second best. 
959,39,33,2Qxe7,b'r4rk1/pp2qp2/2p4p/6p1/2n3b1/2PP3P/P1P2PP1/4RRK1 w - -',I allow queens exchange. Computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that Be6 was the best move. True for when white takes black's queen the rook can't get deep into black's territory. Instead now black's rook will get deep into my territory and threaten the b7 pawn. 
960,39,34,Nd2,b'r4rk1/pp2Rp2/2p4p/6p1/6b1/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/5RK1 w - -',My plan now is to attack the other rook. White cannot make the move Rfd1 because of black's bishop so this plan also saves black's knight and bishop. 
961,39,35,2Rfe1,b'r4rk1/pp2Rp2/2p4p/6p1/6b1/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',A move I expected the rooks are lined up now. 
962,39,36,2Bh5,b'r4rk1/pp2Rp2/2p4p/6pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',I save the bishop but there was still the matter of the b7 pawn...
963,39,37,2Rxb7,b'r4rk1/pR3p2/2p4p/6pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',...which white would take. Black still has a big advantage!
964,39,38,2c5,b'r4rk1/pR3p2/7p/2p3pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',I'm looking to start attacking the white pawns on the c and d files 
965,39,39,2Rc7,b'r4rk1/p1R2p2/7p/2p3pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',White attacks the progressing pawn but I will not allow him to succeed. 
966,39,40,2Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/p1R2p2/7p/2p3pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',It's nice that my rooks are lined up as well. 
967,39,41,2Rb7,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/7p/2p3pb/8/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',No trade of the rooks. I expected that.  
968,39,42,2c4,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/7p/6pb/2p5/2PP3P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',I did plan for fair trade between the two pawns but I seemed to of forgot here how white does not favor fair trade. 
969,39,43,2d4,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/7p/6pb/2pP4/2P4P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Again there is no trade. 
970,39,44,2Bg6,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/6bp/6p1/2pP4/2P4P/P1Pn1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',I hope to gain the c2 pawn. 
971,39,45,2Re2,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/6bp/6p1/2pP4/2P4P/P1PnRPP1/6K1 b - -',I was actually expecting Rc1 but this move is much better for it protects the pawn and attacks the intruding knight. 
972,39,46,2Ne4,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/6bp/6p1/2pPn3/2P4P/P1P1RPP1/6K1 w - -',Only safe move for the knight. It is protected by the bishop. This move also attacks the unprotected c3 pawn. 
973,39,47,2d5,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/6bp/3P2p1/2p1n3/2P4P/P1P1RPP1/6K1 b - -',? White did not try to defend his c3 pawn. It is gone now. 
974,39,48,Be4,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/7p/3P2p1/2p1b3/2n4P/P1PR1PP1/6K1 w - -',My next plan is to attack the d5 pawn. It is now under attack from the knight and the bishop. 
975,39,49,3Re7,b'r1r3k1/p3Rp2/7p/3P2p1/2p1b3/2n4P/P1PR1PP1/6K1 b - -',I don't see how this move would help white. 
976,39,50,3Bxd5,b'r1r3k1/p3Rp2/7p/3b2p1/2p5/2n4P/P1PR1PP1/6K1 w - -',I follow through with my plan. Surprisingly the computer analysis views this move as a blunder. It kinda is because if white plays Re3 next move the knight is lost (or the bishop). The best move was Re8 an attack on white's e7 rook.  
977,39,51,3Rb7,b'r1r3k1/pR3p2/7p/3b2p1/2p5/2n4P/P1PR1PP1/6K1 b - -',?!?!?! On top of white missing the opportunity of gaining a piece back he put his rook right in the path of my bishop! White was already in a hole. Now he's in a hole with grease on the sides! Of course the computer analysis views this as a blunder. The best move was Re3 as pointed out in the previous comment. 
978,39,52,3Bxb7,b'r1r3k1/pb3p2/7p/6p1/2p5/2n4P/P1PR1PP1/6K1 w - -',Black's advantage is massive now!
979,39,53,3Rd7,b'r1r3k1/pb1R1p2/7p/6p1/2p5/2n4P/P1P2PP1/6K1 b - -',I will not allow my bishop to be taken. 
980,39,54,Bc6,b'r1r3k1/p2R1p2/2b4p/6p1/2p5/7P/P1P1nPPK/8 w - -',I attack the intruding rook. 
981,39,55,3Re7,b'r1r3k1/p3Rp2/2b4p/6p1/2p5/7P/P1P1nPPK/8 b - -',White attacks my knight. Of course I must save my knight so it is not taken... 
982,39,56,3Kf8,b'r1r2k2/p3Rp2/2b4p/6p1/2p5/7P/P1P1nPPK/8 w - -',...but for some reason I felt using my king to attack the rook was the best move. Of course not! Black's knight is gone now! This move is a mistake in view of the computer analysis and that Re8 was again the best move. 
983,39,57,3Rxe2,b'r1r2k2/p4p2/2b4p/6p1/2p5/7P/P1P1RPPK/8 b - -',White gains back a little but black still has a really big advantage. 
984,39,58,3Rce8,b'r3rk2/p4p2/2b4p/6p1/2p5/7P/P1P1RPPK/8 w - -',Now I play Re8 but it's a little late for that now lol
985,39,59,c3,b'r3rk2/p4p2/2b4p/6p1/8/2p4P/P1PR1PPK/8 w - -',I attack the rook again. The computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that Rad8 was the best move. This is a mistake because if black plays Rd3 that pawn is lost. 
986,39,60,3Rd6,b'r3rk2/p4p2/2bR3p/6p1/8/2p4P/P1P2PPK/8 b - -',White plays this move instead. White sure is quite persistent on taking the bishop. This is a good move though for now the h6 pawn is lost. 
987,39,61,3Rxh6,b'r3rk2/pb3p2/7R/6p1/8/2p4P/P1P2PPK/8 b - -',The pawn goes but the computer analysis views this as a blunder? Well yes it is because if black plays Re2 white's c2 pawn is lost and a pawn promotion is much more imminent. Rd7 was the best move here. 
988,39,62,3Be4,b'r3rk2/p4p2/7R/6p1/4b3/2p4P/P1P2PPK/8 w - -',I plan to take the c3 pawn with my bishop instead of my rook and provoke the pawn promotion. Computer analysis though views this as a mistake and that again Re2 was the best move. 
989,39,63,3Rc6,b'r3rk2/p4p2/2R5/6p1/4b3/2p4P/P1P2PPK/8 b - -',?!?!?! I see that white's plan was to take my c3 pawn after I took his c2 pawn but who cares about that plan of mine now for white has put his remaining powerful piece in the path of my bishop again! White was in a hole with grease on the sides but now white is simply in a hole that he can't get out of now. Yes computer analysis views this as a blunder! The best move was f4 an attack on black's bishop. 
990,39,64,3Bxc6,b'r3rk2/p4p2/2b5/6p1/8/2p4P/P1P2PPK/8 w - -',Black has won. I've never seen a bishop so hungry lol. All jokes aside the only ways black could lose now is to either allow white to promote one or two pawns or for black to blunder badly multiple times. Neither of those will happen. 
991,39,65,Ba4,b'r3rk2/p4p2/8/6p1/b7/2p2P1P/P1P3PK/8 w - -',Now a pawn promotion seems inevitable. 
992,39,66,4a3,b'r3rk2/p4p2/8/6p1/b7/P1p2P1P/2P3PK/8 b - -',No resignation white keeps playing.  
993,39,67,Ba4,b'r3rk2/p4p2/8/6p1/b5P1/P1p2P1P/7K/8 w - -',I'm preparing to regain my queen well at this moment. 
994,39,68,4f4,b'r3rk2/p4p2/8/6p1/b4PP1/P1p4P/7K/8 b - -',White has simply run out of options to play now. His f4 pawn is lost. 
995,39,69,4h4,b'r3rk2/p4p2/8/8/b4pPP/P1p5/7K/8 b - -',White is interested in promoting his two pawns. 
996,39,70,4Re3,b'r4k2/p4p2/8/8/b4pPP/P1p1r3/7K/8 w - -',I was planning on promoting my pawn but my plans have changed now...
997,39,71,Rb8,b'1r3k2/p4p2/8/6P1/b4p1P/P1p1r3/7K/8 w - -',...I hope for checkmate in a couple of moves. 
998,39,72,4h5,b'1r3k2/p4p2/8/6PP/b4p2/P1p1r3/7K/8 b - -',White is focused on promoting his pawns. Unfortunately for him that was a bad move mate in 2. 
999,39,73,4Kg1,b'5k2/p4p2/8/6PP/b4p2/P1p1r3/1r6/6K1 b - -',No hope for white mate in 1. 
1000,39,74,4Re1#,b'5k2/p4p2/8/6PP/b4p2/P1p5/1r6/4r1K1 w - -',Checkmate! redfox17 fought a well-fought battle but black simply destroyed white in the end. There were plenty of mistakes but we all make mistakes at one point or another. This wonderful game was now over. I can safely say this was my second best game ever! Very fun and enjoyable indeed!
