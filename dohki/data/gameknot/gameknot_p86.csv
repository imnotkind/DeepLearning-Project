For I want to keep the LSB on his square as long as possible because it could be usefull on e2 or d3 and I have no moves to lose for both players have castled on the opposite side. The rush at the Kings will soon begin. Will black defend or will he try to attack the white king and if so he does who will be the quickest ? (I analysed the game as deep as I could and was not sure at all).

Slighlty too defensive for my taste but hey I'm playing black against a 1900+ so...
Besides in both lines the idea is to resist to Nh4 with Bg6 that is accepting to have it exchanged to absorb the force of the white's attack and opening an useful semiopen h column. "

The alternative is Be7 avoiding the ""Knight manouvre"" against my lsb. But in fact I am not disgusted if white plays it so why take a dangerous way with Bd7 Bxa2?

Since I can actually handle e4 (can you see it? Am I right?) is a good moment to play it. The attack on f2 was only a dream so better to forget it. I have in mind to keep control of the game and this accomplishes that purpose. If white goes 12. NxBf5 instead black must think hard about Bxf2+ and if 13.

If I go Be6 White would press me with Bg4 and I can't exchange (After QxB+ I think white has better game because of Bf3) This way white will go Bg4 and if the knight leaves black can play f5. In the meanwhile black has in the agenda Kb8 to unpin the knight and white can't do much about it (Is this true or false?)

Now: how to continue the attack? f5 looks good but... what's the point? f4 maybe? Does it look good? And during the game I wasn't able to focus on the Qb4 move. It was not to threat b2 but because if white goes for NxB hxN opens the column and if I could get my queen to h4... but I can't. White does have defence against it... isn't it? So I played

He can't be preparing b5 because he hasn't got enough backup.  I really don't know what he is planning because it doesn't seem to help his development...Oh well I will carry on developing in the centre with Bd3 preparing to castle.

Also by threatening his knight it forces him to make a strategic decision.  He isn't going to be too keen to swap off bits being so much material down and if he moves the knight my Bishop can plop very comfortably in to b6 where it is going to be such a nuisance cramping his Queenside.

494,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start with the King's Pawn Opening.
495,16,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And he responds with the King's Pawn Game.  Like our last game it will become a Ruy Lopez.
496,16,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In this position he is trying to develop.
497,16,3,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',But that is not going to stop me from castling.  Of course I am not implying that he wants to prevent me from doing that.  However there is an important fact about tucking the monarch away.  According to tactical-abyss castling is considered a developing move.  
498,16,4,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',And this is how he responds.  Now I learned that ...a6 is often played after the Ruy Lopez.  Believe it or not GM Morphy came up with the idea because white can keep pressure even with the loss of tempo.
499,16,5,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1B2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This time however I decide to exchange.  But according to either inadowman or elyhim 5.Ba4 is the best response to 4...a6.  However there is nothing wrong with this move.
500,16,6,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',"In this position I either want to exchange pawns or get my DSB out to pin his Knight.  In this game I am not interested in playing a fianchetto.  When I talked to my mentor about a fianchetto he asked me why.  I told him that I was instructed to fianchetto as much as possible by Jack Stockel.  After my game against the Master Mater my opponent said ""There is only certain systems where a fianchetto is a good move. It's almost never good on white unless you are doing a King's Indian Attack or playing against a King's Indian defense. When I look at that game against Freddy you did the same thing against me. You tried to take your bishop away from my attack which is nonsense. On black they fianchetto in Sicilian Dragons Benoni King's Indian Defense and maybe a Ruy Lopez. They do this because it is the only way to develop the bishop quickly and such. I can show you a million games where the original line the bishop is on aids in a attack of the king. At your level you should be looking at the basics; not playing higher level moves that are very situational. It's not practical and you can't improve without learning attacking. When you look at games you play against Freddy and I how much fianchettos does we do on white? I bet you won't come across to many because it just isn't as good. On black you'll only see use do it in specific systems. Chess is situational and you can't finite your moves because that's how you were taught. There is a time and a place for everything. There is a correlation to what I taught you. You have to have a good reason to make your moves and your reasons for the fianchetto is never a good one. ""  "
501,16,7,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So my opponent decides to accept the exchange.
502,16,8,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"At this point he is trying to win my N.  But ""I cannot allow that"" as Jack Stockel would say."
503,16,9,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Therefore I have to protect it.  2.c3 was also possible but I don't like it as well.  Why? Advancing my c pawn will give my b1 N less room to develop.  It's kind of crammed if you were to play Nd2 as opposed to Nc3.  And Na3 places it on the rim.  Therefore I protect with my DSB as opposed to pinning his Knight.
504,16,10,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I understand the logic behind this move.  Normally it's considered too early to bring the Q out at this time.  But in this position he is trying to win my e4 pawn and I cannot drive his piece away.  Therefore I have to figure a way to protect my P.
505,16,11,Nc3,b'r1b1k2r/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/2b5/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',It took me some time to figure things out but this is White's best move as it turns out.  The reason being is that 9.f3 places a whole around my K.  However I do not want to do that unless it is absolutely necessary and 9.Qd3 is ineffective.  That's because he can still capture my e4 pawn and I can't take back due to his f6 N.  This move however defends and I do not have to worry about anything.  In fact it is another developing move so you basically get the best of both worlds. 
506,16,12,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/2b5/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',In the meantime my opponent decides to castle.  I'm just surprised that he did not do this earlier.  
507,16,13,1Nf5,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/2b2N2/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? After he castles I decide to kick his Q.  I felt that he did not develop properly so I wanted to gain tempii from him.  However this is my first blunder.  I subconciensly placed my N in a spot where it's directly attacked by his LSB.  
508,16,14,Bxe3,b'r4rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/5P2/8/2N1b3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',In this position best is to take back with 12.fxe3.
509,16,15,1Na4,b'r4rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/4b3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"?? Of course I don't recapture.  That's because taking back will put a hole around my K and I remember my first game against dmaestro.  What happened?  I opened my K by moving a pawn right near it.  Believe it or not that was the losing blunder so I did not want to make the same mistake again.  In a different annotation however l-d-j said that ""material is more important than king safety.""  In that this move is a serious blunder as it gives away a free piece."
510,16,16,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/4b3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',After making the decision he decides to kick my Q.
511,16,17,1Qe1,b'3r1rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/4b3/PPP2PPP/R3QRK1 b - -',Normally that's not a problem because I just pull it away.  But there is a little more to this then meets the eye.
512,16,18,1Bc5,b'3r1rk1/1pp1qppp/p1p2n2/2b2P2/N7/8/PPP2PPP/R3QRK1 w - -', 
513,16,19,1Qxe7,b'3r1rk1/1pp1Qppp/p1p2n2/2b2P2/N7/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Of course I should have retreated to 14.Qc1 or 14.Qb1 but I was only thinking about exchanging.  The problem is however that I'm down in material.  When you're behind it's generally a bad idea to exchange but I forgot that in this game.
514,16,20,1Rfe1,b'3r1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',At this point I decide to bring my rooks together.  BTW I have no intention of winning his DSB.  Instead I want to activate and mobilize the Rooks and this accomplishes my goal.
515,16,21,1Rfe8,b'3rr1k1/1pp1bppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Of course he has no choice but to protect his B.
516,16,22,1c3,b'3rr1k1/1pp1bppp/p1p2n2/5P2/N7/2P5/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?? In this position I am only interested in promoting a pawn but he is not going to allow that.
517,16,23,1b5,b'3rr1k1/2p1bppp/p1p2n2/1p3P2/N7/2P5/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - b6',Instead I just gave away another piece which is why I marked 16.c3 with two question marks.  Now I thought that I had a place to retreat my N but it's too little too late.  It is gone after 17...Bxc5.
518,16,24,1b4,b'3rr1k1/2p2ppp/p1p2n2/1pb2P2/1P6/2P5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - b3',However I thought that I could win something back after he decided to take.  But that is not the case because he finds a place to retreat his B.  Of course I will try just about anything because I am aware that he has a winning edge.
519,16,25,1Rxe8+,b'3rR1k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/1p3P2/1P6/2P5/P4PPP/R5K1 b - -',After he retreats however I decide to exchange.  This is not a good choice but I thought that I could win something back after we exchanged rooks.  But how is that going to happen?  He has ways around that so I miscalulated.  When I talk about miscalulations I mean that I plan ahead but in an inaccurate matter.  It does however have the same consequences of not thinking ahead.  When you make the plans and patterns you want to be completely accurate or it could mean disaster.  Unfortunately disaster will strike later on.
520,16,26,2a4,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/1p3P2/PP6/2P5/5PPP/R5K1 b - a3',So I am still interested in winning material but he will prevent that.
521,16,27,2Re2,b'6k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/1p3P2/PP6/2P5/4rPPP/R5K1 w - -',?! Ok I don't why he moved here.  But I feel that it's pointless because it doesn't achieve anything.  As far as I'm concerned he does not have a good reason for this move.
522,16,28,2Rd1,b'6k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/1p3P2/PP6/2P5/4rPPP/3R2K1 b - -',? Therefore I do not hesitate to make this choice.  Of course I did not want to play 21.axb3 for two reasons.  First it's usually a bad idea to exchange when you're behind.  Second if 21.axb5 21...cxb5 so he eliminates his doubled pawns.  Now Jack Stockel told me that it's generally a bad idea to allow your opponent to get rid of his or her doubled pawns because it usually gives him or her an edge.  However I am now in worse shape becuase this move gives away a free pawn after 21...bxa4.
523,16,29,2Rd8+,b'3R2k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/5P2/pP6/2P5/4rPPP/6K1 b - -',Because I know that the game is now lost I don't resign right away.  Instead I decide to place him in check at once.  Afterall I do not have any more to lose since I do not stand a chance.  My goal is to pull a swindle.  But I am not going to be successful especially against one of my mentors.
524,16,30,2Re8,b'3Rr1k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/5P2/pP6/2P5/5PPP/6K1 w - -',Of course this is how he gets out of check as I predicted.
525,16,31,2Rxe8+,b'4R1k1/2p2ppp/pbp2n2/5P2/pP6/2P5/5PPP/6K1 b - -',Therefore I try to catch him off guard by taking his R.  At first I thought that I had some compensation by winning this piece.  However I did not realize that he could retake with his N so this becomes an even exchange.  Consequently I have no way to compensate for lost material.  But I was willing to try because of what I mentioned on my last move.
526,16,32,2c4,b'4n1k1/2p2ppp/pbp5/5P2/pPP5/8/5PPP/6K1 b - -',In the meantime I am still interested in promoting.
527,16,33,2a3,b'4n1k1/2p2ppp/pbp5/5P2/1PP5/p7/5PPP/6K1 w - -',But so is he.
528,16,34,2c5,b'4n1k1/2p2ppp/pbp5/2P2P2/1P6/p7/5PPP/6K1 b - -',So I decide to keep pushing my pawn.
529,16,35,2a2,b'4n1k1/2p2ppp/pbp5/2P2P2/1P6/8/p4PPP/6K1 w - -',At this point I realize that he is going to promote and there is nothing that I can do about that.  Therefore I resigned.  After this game myevilluck told me that I played quite well.  He said that I should be able to make significant improvements in my games.  And he would be disappointed if I could not.  Then I solved the mystery by telling him that I have problems with consistency.  Afterall this is my main weak area.  It's because I remember everything in one game but forget all of them in the next game so it goes back and forth.  After that he told me that paying attention is the solution.  If I pay better attention my rating should easily reach 1400.  Why?  I know too much information for my rating to stay like this.  In that the moral of this story is to focus and concentrate on the game because all of the positions are extremely important.

550,18,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French Defense. Viewed by many to be dull(as in the exchange variation) it actually leads to sharp and tactical positions; the Winawer for example.
551,18,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',2. d3 leads to a rather closed position: 2...d5 3. Nd2(3. Qe2 Nf6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. g3 0-0 6. Bg2 c5 when Black has a sturdy and dynamic position)3...Nf6 4. Ngf3 b6 5. c3 c5!? 6. Qa4+!? Qd7 7. Qc2 Qc7 8. Be2 Nc6. This move is probably the best move in the position and the most natural.
552,18,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',? 2...d5 is the best continuation. Now White has a strong sturdy center while Black has nothing to show for it. 
553,18,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2pp3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? Another bad move. 3...Nf6 should be tried though after 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bd3 Be7 6.

560,18,10,a4,b'r1bqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/P3P3/2N1BN2/1PPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq a3',And now I want more space on the queenside. Also possible was 0-0-0.

563,18,13,Ng4,b'r1bqkb1r/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/N3P1n1/3BBN2/1PPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',He wants his knight for the bishop though the knights are stronger than bishops in this kind of position. Still this trades off a supporter of the c5 square the one where White desperately wants a white pawn on.

565,18,15,Nb6,b'r1bqk2r/2p1bpp1/pn1p3p/3Pp3/NP2P3/3BQN2/2P1KPPP/R6R w kq -',Black obviously wants to trade pieces and go into a endgame. This would be bad for White to trade pieces because trading pieces in a cramped position is good for the defender. So I avoid Nxb6 also because the c3-c4-c5 advance would be much harder to make.
566,18,16,Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1bp1bpp1/pn1p3p/3Pp3/1P2P3/3BQN2/1NP1KPPP/R6R w kq -',Black cannot make the advance c6 happen yet because his a6 pawn would be hanging. This is a idea in the future though.

I was impressed by this move; Black attempts to get active pieces for some material; the question is whether this is enough or not. In my opinion it is not though it takes some good play by White. Anyway this is a good pyschological decision; he's not going to sit hopelessly and get squashed! 
570,18,20,2f3,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p2q4/3bp1p1/1P6/3BQP2/1N2K1PP/R1R5 b - -',(?) Hard to say how I could have missed 21. Qc5! Qxc5 22. Rxc5 c6 23. Rxa6 and Black will lose a huge amount of material.

574,18,24,2Bxe4,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p2q4/3b4/1P2B1p1/4QP2/1NR1K1PP/R7 b - -',? Panicking...

Though pushing it against the far right side of the board while the pawns are on the left may be a decent long term strategy.  Black's king is better off shepherding pawns or gutting the king.  Pg blocks any further movement of the h pawn.  So Pf should be promoted.

749,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So Joe decides to kick things off with the well known King's Pawn Opening.
750,26,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And Ben responds by starting with the Sicilian Defense.  As we will see later on however this defense is not going to continue.
751,26,2,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',On the one hand as everyone has said repeatedly in previous annotations it's important to stick with the principles.  In that I would have played 2.Nf3 if I were white as it often leads to an Open Sicilian especially after 2...d6 3.d4.  On the other hand as easy19 told me when you're rating is super high like 2000+ you can deviate from the basics and still play just as well.  That is happening here.
752,26,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I understand that black wanted to prevent white from playing 3.Bc5.  However if I were black I would have played 2...Nf6 to kick the Q while continuing to develop normally because it normally loses important tempii for the opponent.  On the other hand that would not have made a difference this time because of what white plays next.
753,26,4,Qxf7+,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppQpp/p7/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',!! Normally I would mark this with two question marks because giving up your Q like this is often the losing blunder.  This time however I view it as extraordinarily brilliant.  As we will see later on this is a winning move.
754,26,5,Nf3,b'rnbq1bnr/1p1ppkpp/p7/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',After the sac however Joe decides to develop.
755,26,6,h6,b'rnbq1bnr/1p1ppkp1/p6p/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',I don't understand why black moved here.  Better was to either develop or bring the K back to safety given that he can't castle.  If you had to ask me however my vote would be to retreat the King where it is no longer exposed.
756,26,7,Ne5+,b'rnbq1bnr/1p1ppkp1/p6p/2p1N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',So after Ben's last move white decides to place black in check.  Now Joe's opponent has no choice but to move the K.
757,26,8,Ke8,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1pp1p1/p6p/2p1N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',! Good choice.  Ben also could have played 5...Ke6!? but that would have excaberated the exposure.  This however takes it away.
758,26,9,Be2,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1pp1p1/p6p/2p1N3/4P3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',I don't completely understand this move.  I mean that mate will be threatned soon which is why white played this.  But in this position Joe also could have threatened mate with 6.Bc4.  And Ben would be forced to give up his d pawn in order to avoid that. 
759,26,10,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2p1p1/p2p3p/2p1N3/4P3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? On the other hand I understand this move.  Black played it in order to kick Joe's N.  The problem is that it gives white the opportunity that he's been waiting for the threat of mate after 7.Bh5+ so this move loses immediately.  I mean I would have thought about this move but would have played 6...Nf6 to prevent what is about to unfold.

That's because I have lately been playing against the Ruy Lopez Opening not the Siclian.  So this is basically how it happens.  As we all know I am familiar with both the Ruy Lopez and Siclian but it's about getting used to something that you are not accustomed to.  For instance I was used to playing against 1...e5 opening because I recently played against this less then a week ago.  On the contrary it was about two weeks since I played against 1...c5.  Those this makes you susceptible to that mistake.  The only problem however is that this flaw costs me a pawn.  And unlike my usual games against him there will be no going back this time.
878,32,4,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/8/2BNn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"That's because I told him Oh my gosh!  I can't believe that I missed it.  I am used to the Open Siclian and I have not made that mistake in a long time.  In addition there are times where I can undo my mistake against this coach but not this time.  That's because he said ""It's too late.  You gave me that pawn."" "
879,32,5,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/8/2BNn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',In the meantime I decide to castle.
880,32,6,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/2BNn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',As usual this is what he plays.  Afterall you often see 6...a6 in the Sicilian that's called the Siclian Nadjorf.  I know because this is the defense that I generally play.
881,32,7,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/2BNn3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',In the meantime I am determined to continue developing.
882,32,8,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BN4/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',?! At this point I want to bring my other N out.  My opponent sees this and responds with this move.  The reason being that I am going to play 8.Nc3 in order to complete development.  When this happens his N would get attacked.  However that is not a good reason for moving here so I view this as his first inaccuracy.  With this move Mr. Stockel just wasted tempo when he could have spent the time to develop.  Better was 7...d5 which also protects his piece and attacks my LSB.  In addition I would not be able to capture the d5 pawn due to his N and Q.  Therefore it would have benefited Jack and given him tempo.
883,32,9,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2BN4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq e6',Meanwhile he decides to attack my N.  This time however I have a safe place to retreat it so I do not mind.   
884,32,10,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/2B5/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Of course he decides to continue with development.
885,32,11,1Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p1N1/2B5/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"! But I have plans instead.  That's right for a first time in a while I go for cheapo tactics.  Overall I don't have a lot to lose since I blundered away a pawn.  In this position I am only determined to get back a pawn.  Afterall as I already know one pawn is usually enough to make the difference between win and loss in an endgame.  And my opponent said ""Very good move"" which is why I marked with an exclamation point as opposed to critisizing it.  He saw what I was trying to do.  In a normal game this would count as unsound aggression but not against Jack.  In fact he deliberately allowed me to attack it and this is a test that I just passed with flying color.  About two months ago I spoke to him about unsound aggression based on what the commentators told me.  He said that although it is a cheapo ""it's still an idea"".  It's always good to come up with ideas in chess as it proves that you are thinking ahead and not just move by move.  In fact that's why I ""took unsound aggression to be a good thing"" as cdeburca criticized me for in a different annotation.  In this case however my plan will work and I will essentially gain back what was lost and then some.  His right to castle will be revoked.  On the other hand I do agree in some respects not to make it into too much of a habitat because as inadowman said repeadetly in other annotations the threat is too obvious and easy to drive off."
886,32,12,1Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p1N1/2B5/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?? I understand that he wanted to continue with development but this is his first blunder.  And it's quite serious.  Either way he has to give up his f pawn.  In this position black should have moved his Q to the 7th rank and that would have made 10.Ng5 pointless by preventing my next move.
887,32,13,1Bxf7+,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bBpp/p1np1n2/4p1N1/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"After I took with the bishop he said ""You could have taken with the N instead.  Then you would have won the R.""  This time however I disagree with his assessment and I cannot go by what Jack says.  I have to base it on the position.  If 11.Nxf7?! 11...Rf8 so that move would be pointless.  I told him that this move is better in my opinion.  That's because even if I had won his major piece he would have been able to develop the other way and castle Q side.  This however takes away his opportunity to castle and I still get what I essentially lost a pawn.  Which is the main reason why I moved here.  However as mentioned earlier a second look shows that he could protect his Rook even if I were to take with the N.  So this move is better as it achieves more.  "

In this position I am only trying to put his K under pressure and make him feel stressed.  Afterall stress can negatively affect you in a game so that is what I'm attempting to cause.  And I am planning on how to do that.  However my plan is not going to work because he will just take and force an exchange.
890,32,16,Qc7,b'r4k1r/1pq1b1pp/p1npBn2/4p3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Well he still wants to complete development.  Despite not being able to castle it is feasible for him to achieve what he wants.  However it generally takes an extra move to do so. 
891,32,17,1Nd5,b'r4k1r/1pq1b1pp/p1npBn2/3Np3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"That however does not stop me from attacking his B and Q.  This time I am trying to win his Q.  Although it looks obvious and easy to drive off ""it's not so easy.""  I already know that he is going to retreat.  So my goal is to keep attacking his Q so that he feels overwhelmed and under pressure.  That way I just continue to drive at it until he has no where to move his Q away from danger.  In other words it gets trapped.  That's because I remember my first game against binblaster and he won by trapping my Q.  I'm just trying to remember it and apply that technique to my advantage.  Of course that is not going to happen."
892,32,18,1Qd8,b'r2q1k1r/1p2b1pp/p1npBn2/3Np3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So he retreats as I expected.
893,32,19,1Bb6,b'r2q1k1r/1p2b1pp/pBnpBn2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And I reattack it.
894,32,20,1Qb8,b'rq3k1r/1p2b1pp/pBnpBn2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So he pulls it away.
895,32,21,1Bc7,b'rq3k1r/1pB1b1pp/p1npBn2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But I come up with another way to go on the offense.
896,32,22,1Qa7,b'r4k1r/qpB1b1pp/p1npBn2/3Np3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Of course he finds a way around that.  Now I expected him to play 16...Qe7 that also protects his Q as I cannot play 17.Bd7 due to his Q and f6 N.  This move however is equally effective in protecting his piece.
897,32,23,1Nxe7,b'r4k1r/qpB1N1pp/p1npBn2/4p3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',!! This move is where I really start thinking ahead.  As it turns out this decision wins material.  I orginally thought that it only forced an exchange.  But I am able to find a move that I almost missed.  After we exchange I can grab one of his pawns by placing him in check with 18.Qxd6+.
898,32,24,Ke8,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p1nQBn2/4p3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Forced.
899,32,25,1Rfd1,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p1nQBn2/4p3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',! In the meantime I decide to bring my R directly behind the Q.  Afterall I learned how to do this in the Alkehine Memorial Tourney in which GM Judit Polgar commented in.  Of any game I saw most people also alingned one of their Rooks with the Q.  From what I saw it helped them play better.  In addition my coach told me that this is a good move.
900,32,26,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p2QBn2/4p3/3n4/8/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',However I also saw most of the opponents block the connection with one of their.  And that is exactly what happened just now.  Although he never saw the game my opponent already knows that this kind of coordination can become dangerous.  So he is not going to allow that.
901,32,27,2c3,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p2QBn2/4p3/3n4/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',?? Therefore I thought that I had the advantage because this move kicks his N.  I inaccurately predicted that his retreat would benefit my positon by keeping the coordination.  As it turns out that is not the case.   
902,32,28,2Nb5,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p2QBn2/1n2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',"Instead he is going to a win a piece which is why 20.c3?? was my first ""outright blunder"".  Afterall I am either going to lose a B or Q as it will not be feasible to defend both.  Before move 20 white did not make any serious mistake.  "
903,32,29,2Qd3,b'r3k2r/qpB3pp/p3Bn2/1n2p3/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',As a result I decide to sac my B.  Afterall a Q is much more valuable so giving that away is almost a losing blunder especially against his rating.
904,32,30,2Qc4,b'r3k2r/qpn3pp/p3Bn2/4p3/2Q5/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Therefore I try to get something back with this move a piece.  But that is not going to happen this time.

906,32,32,2Qc6+,b'r3k2r/q1n3pp/p1Q1Bn2/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',But I do not give in.  Instead of moving it away I decide to take advantage by placing him in check. 
907,32,33,2Ke7,b'r6r/q1n1k1pp/p1Q1Bn2/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Forced.  In this position his only other option was 23...Kf8 but then I get a draw by repetition after 24.Qd6+.  Of course he kept that mind before making this move.
908,32,34,2Qd6+,b'r6r/q1n1k1pp/p2QBn2/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',! Nonetheless I am still determined to put him under pressure and produce stress by continuing to place him in check.  However my plan is not going to work as he will be able to get out of it and eventually find a safe spot where it will no longer be feasible to do this.  On the other hand he told me that this is another good move.  But it's for the wrong reason.  My coach implied what I mentioned on move 19.  That it's generally a good idea to have your Q directly in front of a R. 
909,32,35,2Ke8,b'r3k2r/q1n3pp/p2QBn2/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Also forced.
910,32,36,2Bd7+,b'r3k2r/q1nB2pp/p2Q1n2/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',So I try to find a different strategy to put pressure on him.  Although it temporarily works he will find a way out of this.  First he will exchange my B for his N.  That however is something that I did not want because I am behind in material but I don't have a choice at this point. 
911,32,37,Kf8,b'r4k1r/q1nQ2pp/p7/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Once again this is forced.
912,32,38,2Qd6+,b'r4k1r/q1n3pp/p2Q4/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',So I take advantage with this move.
913,32,39,2Kf7,b'r6r/q1n2kpp/p2Q4/1p2p3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',"This time however he finds a way to get rid of the pressure throughout most of the game.  That's because this move was not forced and that's what I mean when I talk about stress.  It's about Psychology and the ""Fight or Flight"" response.  By putting him in a situation where he is forced to make a certain move If I were black I would feel a little stressed nervous.  So I am now trying to use that to my advantage because I know that too much can adversely affect your performance if you get overloaded with that.  Of course he is not going to allow that since he taught me how to handle that situation."
914,32,40,2Qxe5,b'r6r/q1n2kpp/p7/1p2Q3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',However that is not going to stop me from taking his pawn.  At least I have some compensation for what I previously blundered away.  Note: this pawn is free.
915,32,41,2Rhd8,b'r2r4/q1n2kpp/p7/1p2Q3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',At this point he wants to exchange rooks.
916,32,42,2Qf5+,b'r2r4/q1n2kpp/p7/1p3Q2/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',But I am not going to allow that since I am still behind.  Therefore I decide to place him in check but this will be my last time in doing so.
917,32,43,2Kg8,b'r2r2k1/q1n3pp/p7/1p3Q2/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',! He also could have 29...Kd7 or 29...Kd8.  But this is the best move in this position.  Had he moved anywhere else his WK would not be as protected.  BTW I am alluding to king safety.
918,32,44,3Rde1,b'r2r2k1/q1n3pp/p7/1p3Q2/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?? In this position I am trying to bring R close to the Q.  In most games that I witness the opponent usually aligns one his or her Rooks to the Queen.  According to my opponent however this is the losing blunder. When the game was over Mr. Stockel said that I did not have time to make this move.
919,32,45,3Rdf8,b'r4rk1/q1n3pp/p7/1p3Q2/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Of course he decides to kick my Q.  He also could have reattacked one of my Rooks with 20...Re8 but this is the move I thought he would make.

921,32,47,3Qxf2+,b'r4rk1/2n3pp/p7/1p6/4Q3/2P5/PP3qPP/R3R1K1 w - -',For a change he decides to place me in check by taking my f pawn.  Now I know that I'm in a lot of trouble.
922,32,48,3Kh1,b'r4rk1/2n3pp/p7/1p6/4Q3/2P5/PP3qPP/R3R2K b - -',Forced.
923,32,49,3Rae8,b'4rrk1/2n3pp/p7/1p6/4Q3/2P5/PP3qPP/R3R2K w - -',After taking my pawn and placing me in check it looked like he was going to win my Q for a R and that's what I told him.  In fact I resigned on that ground.  However my opponent accurately showed me how we could exchange Queens.  Therefore I asked Mr. Stockel if resignation was premature.  He told that it was not.  Why?  In a few moves from now Jack said that he will be able to promote a pawn and there was nothing I could do to prevent it even with best play.  In fact he showed me how black could queen.  In that the position is hopeless for white.

Black has rook and 2 pawns for 2 Knights - nominally a pawn's worth ahead but in practice thought to be pretty much even.  At the moment the game is hard to call as the two knights can be hard to break down.  However Black has a majority on both wings and White's central passed pawn is isolated and vulnerable.  Meanwhile White has to do something about the pinned Knight at g1.  Could Black have improved in the meantime?  It seems that Queen checks at e2 or a4 or g4 might have to be examined in future games.

Black must have the edge and the initiative I think based upon the mobility of his rooks and of the 3-1 majority on the K-side.  But the knight pair ought not to be underestimated.

The d4-Knight is pinned and his other pieces committed to its defence.  In effect they have been immobilized and it is not so easy perhaps to hit upon a plan to re-mobilize them.  This move seems to be essential - after all without it Black could still have gone in for the ...Re2ch line having stolen a march (...f5) on the K-side.
1036,34,30,2Kf6,b'3r4/pp5p/5kp1/5p2/3Nr3/5NP1/PP3K2/3R4 w - -',As planned.  That White was threatening Re1 was incidental.

That suggests one of two moves: 26Rd2 to place the rook under protection of Knight and allow the d4-Knight to move; or 26.Rd3 with the idea of bringing the rook across to b3 or a3  and give up the knights for rook and pawn.  It is doubtful that White could hold the endgame but at least he could go down swinging.
1038,34,32,2h5,b'3r4/pp6/5kp1/5p1p/3Nr3/1P3NP1/P4K2/3R4 w - h6',(!) Ordinarily I would prefer ...g5 but I wanted to hold back White's g-pawn.
1039,34,33,2Rd3,b'3r4/pp6/5kp1/5p1p/3Nr3/1P1R1NP1/P4K2/8 b - -',It is too late for this now that a pawn stands on b3.  Instead Rd2 was indicated.
1040,34,34,2g5,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/5ppp/3Nr3/1P1R1NP1/P4K2/8 w - -',So far have Black's K-side pawns advanced in 4 moves whilst White has been unable to find a way to break out of the bind.
1041,34,35,2Rd2,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/5ppp/3Nr3/1P3NP1/P2R1K2/8 b - -',(!) At last - but it is really too late.  The Black pawns charge into the attack.
1042,34,36,2f4,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/6pp/3Nrp2/1P3NP1/P2R1K2/8 w - -',I had originally intended 28...g4 and as it turns out that would have been OK.  But having arrived at this position this move at once imposed itself upon my awareness as even better.
1043,34,37,Rxf4,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/6pp/3N1r2/1P3N2/P2R1K2/8 w - -',The threat is to pin and win the Knight (...g4).
1044,34,38,3Kg2,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/6pp/3N1r2/1P3N2/P2R2K1/8 b - -',If 30.Kg3 then ...h4ch  31.Kg2 g4  32.Nxh4 Rfxd4  And now White pretty much has to exchange rooks: 33.Rxd4 Rxd4  34.Kg3 Kg5  35.Ng2 Re2  36.Ne3 Rd3  37.Kf2 Rxd3  38.Kxd3 g3  39.Ke2 Kg4  40.Kf1 Kf3 and wins.
1045,34,39,3g4,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/7p/3N1rp1/1P3N2/P2R2K1/8 w - -',Forcing away one of the guards of the d4-Knight.
1046,34,40,3Kg3,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/7p/3N1rp1/1P3NK1/P2R4/8 b - -',(!) A neat try but Black has one winning move available.
1047,34,41,3Re4,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/7p/3Nr1p1/1P3NK1/P2R4/8 w - -',(!) There was only one other possibility but that left White with a fine drawing chance: 31...gxf3?  32.Kxf4 f2  33.Rxf2 Rxd4ch  34.Kd3ch Ke5  35.Rf7.  But now White must lose a knight.
1048,34,42,3Kh4,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/7p/3Nr1pK/1P3N2/P2R4/8 b - -',(?) An oversight in a position already lost.  So White loses both Knights... So how could White improve his defence? I spent a lot of time looking at 32.Nb5 as the most obvious try. It looks as though Black might have to exchange rooks doesn't it? Having looked at 32.Nb5 Rxd2 33.Nxd2 Re5 34.Nxa7 Rxa5 35.Nc8 Rxa2 as a 'working line' I felt there just had to be something better. Sure enough there is. It did not take long to find: 32.Nb5 h4ch!! The pawn can not be taken without loss of Knight or Rook so the King has to retreat. He has but one reasonable square: 33.Kf2 g3+! 34.Kf1 Rxd2 - Now's the right moment! - 35.Nxd2 g2+! 36.Kg1 Re1ch 37.Kxg2 Re2ch 38.Kh3 Rxd2. This whole 6-move sequence is forced. White continues: 39.Kxh4 Rxa2 40.Nd6 Rb2 41.Nxb7 Rxb3 and Black wins a not-very-difficult ending.
1049,34,43,3gxf3+,b'3r4/pp6/5k2/7p/3Nr2K/1P3p2/P2R4/8 w - -',(0-1) It's check the King has to move and so the d4-Knight so long in the forefront of battle at last bites the dust.  Possibly White had intended 33.Kxh4 here but 33...Rh8ch would have been mate.  May I congratulate my opponent who in losing still played well above his 1337 rating.

1. e4 c5
I come here to say that this is all for all.. I'll play Sicilian Defense and I'm here to win!"

From now on I play myself I mean without knowing the theory or main line in this position. Something I know here it's a good plan to play e5 so his white Bishop can't play well because of his own pawn on e4.
1159,37,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Nc6 controling d4 and e5

My opponent plays e4 and now I feel that I'm playing a closed opening (it doesn't looks like a common e4 opening). Now white has showed his plan: King side castle and an attack to the king side (I know this because of the pawn chain structure). But this position has something peculiar.. the f2 bishop. That piece covers somehow d5 and attacks the queen side. Now I have to decide how I'm going to play what will be my plan.
1162,37,7,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Not decided to do d5 before putting my king on safe I develop my Bishop. The common battery of Qc7 and Bd6 to pressure h6 in some Sicilian Games clearly doesn't make any sense in this position and a fianchetto in the king side is a little bit slow I want to gain some space or at least put my king on safe to start measures in centre. 
1163,37,8,f4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP2P1/PPP3BP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',f4!? an interesting move that I allowed playing Be7 instead of d5 White has seen that he can gain space and attach the king side putting pressure in e5 and f5.

As white has hurried to pressure the king side now I hurry to queen side attack meanwhile I speculate with the castle.. maybe I'm going to King side castle or maybe queen side or maybe I'm going to leave the king in the centre! .. 
1166,37,11,Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Qc7 a normal Sicilian develop for the queen. Qb6 is other interesting option here as h5!? could be (an attack with the white bishop on b7 h5 Ng4 h4 is very common to see in GM as Karpov in this kind of positions.

I know that white will mount an attack in the king side while I plan to Queen-side attack maybe mixing my attack with some center attack. I do this because I know his Knights and pawn structure in the king side are not well positioned so I should be able to survive his attack and in some point I hope my attack will be faster than his (I'm counting that in this king of attacks as White throws his king pawns the King is exposed to many checks).
1171,37,16,Bb7,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/1pp5/4PPP1/3P1N1P/PPP1N1B1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Bb7?! maybe it's a mistake here. f5! and Ng3 are good moves for White as he is first in the attack. Also the bishop on c8 somehow help in the defend of the king.
1172,37,17,1a3,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/1pp5/4PPP1/P2P1N1P/1PP1N1B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',a3? Surely Ng3 or f5 where better for white here.

1174,37,19,1f5,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1pP2/4P1P1/P2P1N1P/1PP1N1B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White is happy closing the position as he knows that if he can reach h5 and g5 with pawns supported with the pieces he has right now the pressure over h7 g7 will be deadly mortal.

Here I'm aiming to many things: 1) If white doesn't take my knight well it is a HUGE knight over there. It makes pressure over almost all the white side plus I can always exchange it for his f3 knight which is the most active one white has. 2) I want the a8-a1 diagonal free for my white bishop 3) I'm aiming to have the c-row open to use it with my rooks.

I'm still calm as I know White have troubles in his c-row and if I'm able to enter I will have a very expose king. Also I'm very proud of my defense abilities so I'm counting that I will survive to his attack. Here f6 for white seems to be the move that's why I played Bd8.. after the game and with a computer analysis It gives Be7 the best one.. seems that the computer can survive to anything with tactic.. After that in my next games I surely will analyse Be7-f7-Bd5 (now I like it because even when white is the one attacking in the king side it's a premature attack without enough piece force.. I need to be more brave ;)
1178,37,23,f6,b'r2b1rk1/1bq3pp/p4p2/1p1ppPP1/3pP3/P2P1N1P/1PP1Q1B1/R4RK1 w - -',f6. Not the best move but I didn't want to think all the troubles that could involve the position if white do f6 first.. As my style of chess I thought I would prefer to defend this position than the other one (after the computer analysis the other position was much more easy to play as Black.. damn! why I'm so thought-lazy?)

Well when I moved Qe7 of course I knew white will play Qh5 so I calculated h6 first as Bxg5 allowed white to take with h-pawn or with the rook in both cases putting a lot of pressure in h-pawn. While I was analyzing this move (h6) I saw a counter attack that surely exist (here exist a LOT of moves black can always sacrifice his white bishop on f5 to do e4 and go with checks and pressure over the white king or having activity for example (one of many). 
1194,37,39,Bd7,b'5rk1/3bq1p1/p1r2b1p/1p2pP1Q/3pP2P/P2B3N/1PP4K/2R3R1 w - -',what?! wait and the h-pawn? I know!!!   Bd7 was the best move I saw! I know I'm going to lose the h pawn but I have counter attack! really believe me! Bd7 is necessary to play Be8 later.

First I was going to move Be8 expeling his queen and then Rh6 giving black a good counter attack (playing this was the first option for Rybka engine! even better than BxNg5 giving black advantage of 06 pawns!). But I lost my mind because of people pressure (at this time all the players were standing up from their chairs and I got nervous and made my move without thinking.. I had 18 min. left on my clock and my opponent only 3:30 mins so surely was an stupid mistake not to use wisely my time and think).

1217,39,9,1f3,b'r4r2/pp2ppkp/1qpn2p1/3p4/3P2P1/2PBPP1P/PPQ5/R3K2R b KQ -',I should have played f4 bravely...

1219,39,11,1O-O-O,b'4rr2/pp3pkp/1qpn2p1/3pp3/3P2P1/1PPBPP1P/P1Q5/2KR3R b - -',Black has e4 now. My attack has vanished because of my previous week moves.

1223,39,15,Rxf3,b'4r3/pp4kp/1qpn2p1/3p4/3P2R1/1PPB1r1P/P1Q5/2KR4 w - -',and greedily takes f3 a very good spot indeed but for...
1224,39,16,2Bxg6,b'4r3/pp4kp/1qpn2B1/3p4/3P2R1/1PP2r1P/P1Q5/2KR4 b - -',What can black do now?
1225,39,17,2Ne4,b'4r3/pp4kp/1qp3B1/3p4/3Pn1R1/1PP2r1P/P1Q5/2KR4 w - -',To stop the queen but losing hard material. I wondered here if something like Qg2 could have decided the game right now but black gets a perpetual as a minimum after Rxc3+.
1226,39,18,Kf8,b'4Bk2/pp5p/1qp5/3p4/3Pn1R1/1PP2r1P/P1Q5/2KR4 w - -',...and this is kind of bizarre. I should retreat my bishop on d7? It looks dangerous black's possible Rf2 with a possible counterattack. So I tried to force the game under my terrain. 
1227,39,19,2Qxe4,b'4Bk2/pp5p/1qp5/8/3PQ3/1PP2r1P/P7/2KR4 b - -',...and I save the bishop with threat. But it will be not so easy to get out of this. 
1228,39,20,Qb4,b'4Bk2/pp5p/2p5/8/1q1PQ3/1Pr4P/P2K4/3R4 w - -',Ok now I have +3 but I am under a strong attack and I doubt I can save the bishop! Very interesting isn't it?
1229,39,21,2Qf5+,b'4Bk2/pp5p/2p5/5Q2/1q1P4/1Pr4P/P2K4/3R4 b - -',I tried to go for a perpetual or something. In the meanwhile I started to think that simply Ke2 could have be the best one. But it became so tricky and nasty that it was difficult to analyze everything in a blitz. I had to be effective.
1230,39,22,Kd8,b'3k4/pp5p/2p5/4Q3/1q1P4/1Pr4P/P2K4/3R4 w - -',If black exchanges queens loses the rook so he can only hide. If Qb8+ after Kd7 the black queen has no check anymore and white loses. 
1231,39,23,3Qf7+,b'8/ppk2Q1p/2p5/8/1q1P4/1Pr4P/P2K4/3R4 b - -',I am running out of checks... I have lost my bishop for nothing!

1233,39,25,3Qf2,b'8/pp5p/1kp5/8/3P4/1Pq4r/P3KQ2/3R4 b - -',I decided I could try to provoke exchanges with this but I was not in danger. Can you tell? But in the meanwhile my queen is po(i)sitioned...
1234,39,26,3d5+,b'8/pp5p/1kp5/3P4/8/1Pq4r/P2RKQ2/8 b - -',Interesting... attacking from the defence. Kind of rare and it is the second time in this game. 
1235,39,27,3d6,b'8/pp5p/1k1P4/2p5/8/1Pq4r/P2RKQ2/8 b - -',The little pawn can become a threat... more than the bishop!
1236,39,28,Qe8,b'4q3/pp5p/1k1P4/2p5/8/1P6/P1KR1Q2/7r w - -',Black seems to have ran out of useful checks too! Of course my king is blocking the c column for the rook... my opponent played well. 
1237,39,29,Qd8,b'3q4/pp1P3p/1k6/2p5/8/1P6/P1KR1Q2/7r w - -',...but not his queen is badly trapped!

1239,39,31,4Kb3,b'3q4/pp1P3p/1k6/2p4r/1P6/1K6/P2R1Q2/8 b - -',The king must threat to join the fry so my rook can eventually move to the c column.

1241,39,33,4Qe2+,b'3q4/pp1P3p/8/1kp4r/1P6/1K6/P2RQ3/8 b - -',...that I wanted to be sure - so many surprised seemed to deserve this game. 
1242,39,34,4Kc6,b'3q4/pp1P3p/2k5/2p4r/1P6/1K6/P2RQ3/8 w - -',Qd6+ was deadly. I was in bad shape really!
1243,39,35,4b5+,b'3q4/pp1P3p/2k5/1Pp4r/8/1K6/P2RQ3/8 b - -',Well not completely bad too!
1244,39,36,4Qxh5,b'3q4/ppkP3p/8/1Pp4Q/8/1K6/P2R4/8 b - -',Do you want to go on my friend?
1245,39,37,4Qd5,b'6q1/ppkP3p/8/1PpQ4/8/1K6/P2R4/8 b - -',No more surprises Joe... 
1246,39,38,4Rd3,b'8/ppkP3p/8/1PpQ4/8/1K1R2q1/P7/8 b - -',...and the checks are over. Now it's curtain... whew! I didn't deserve this one!
