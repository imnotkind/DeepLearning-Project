0,0,0,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is one of many games I have played against spirit1. I know he likes to fianchetto his bishops thereby attacking the centre from a distance
1,0,1,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/1P4P1/P1PPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The gameknot database describes this as Benko's opening. It;s a slightly unusual one for me as black however I wanted to push my pawns forward in the centre as I knew I would have the opportunity to do
2,0,2,Bb2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',The first fianchetto
3,0,3,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq e6',This restricts the diagonal of the fianchetto'd bishop and applies some pressure in the centre
4,0,4,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1P1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This is the first move that varies the move order in Benko's opening
5,0,5,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1P1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',This applies further pressure on the centre and opens the diagonal for my lsb. The disadvantage of this position is that it is tricky to get my dsb to a good diagonal it is however supporting the c5 pawn should it be needed
6,0,6,Bg2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',As expected
7,0,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',This returns us to Gameknot database Benko's opening territory
8,0,8,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBP2PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',This is probably about the best square for my dsb at the moment and it opens up the kings side for castling
9,0,9,Nd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBPN1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Opening up possibilities of castling long if he does however I am ready for a queen side assault
10,0,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBPN1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',At this point there are two games in the Gameknot database and black won both. Although both sides are almost equal in development I prefer black at the moment as  I feel the peices are a little more co-ordinated for an assault.
11,0,11,c4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/2P5/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQ c3',I have the option now of opening the game up by taking the pawn or closing the centre and possibly opening the e file with pawn d5
12,0,12,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2ppp3/2P5/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',In the end I opted for this to maintain pressure on the centre. I was also looking now to prevent him from castling if possible
13,0,13,Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbb3/2pnp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',"I wanted to keep my lsb and this also opened the diagonal for my queen as he will most likely castle on the kings side now. If I had taken with the knight he would probably be forced to Ng f3 preparing the way for him to castle. I didn't want to push him to making a move he wanted to anyway

14,0,14,f5,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbb3/2pnpp2/8/1P1PPNP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R w KQ f6',Putting further pressure on the centre and preparing for a push with my pawns

16,0,16,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1pp2/4P3/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I'm happy for him to take the pawn as it gives a half open e file and If I get to open the file I can pressure his king
17,0,17,f4,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1p3/4Pp2/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',reopens the diagonal for my bishop and cramps the white position further the white queen has limited options
18,0,18,1Nc4,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1p3/2N1Pp2/1P1P1NP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Threatens the bishop and the e pawn. however if he takes the bishop I retake with my queen and can then put a rook on d to pressure his d pawn which would be difficult to defend.
19,0,19,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/2N1Ppb1/1P1P1NP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Pinning the knight and relieving some of the pressure on my e pawn
20,0,20,1Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/2N1Ppb1/1P1P1NP1/PB1Q1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',removing the pin and threatening c3 which puts even more pressure on my e pawn
21,0,21,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/pp1q2pp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/2N1Ppb1/1P1P1NP1/PB1Q1PBP/R4RK1 w - -',Links the rooks which is almost always good also means that  15 ... bh3 16 bxb Qxb applies some pressure to his king
22,0,22,1Nfxe5,b'r4rk1/pp1q2pp/2nb1n2/2p1N3/2N1Ppb1/1P1P2P1/PB1Q1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Finally it falls and he has two strong knights in the centre
23,0,23,Qxg4,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/5n2/2p5/4Ppq1/1P1P2P1/P2Q1PBP/R4RK1 w - -',He has completely demolished the centre however my forces are not too badly placed for an attack
24,0,24,1e5,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/5n2/2p1P3/5pq1/1P1P2P1/P2Q1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Threatening to take my b pawn
25,0,25,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/8/2p1P2n/5pq1/1P1P2P1/P2Q1PBP/R4RK1 w - -',This applies pressure to his pawns with my f rook well placed to provide support
26,0,26,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/5pq1/1P1P2P1/P2Q1P1P/R4RK1 w - -',Possibly no tthe best move but it puts the rook on a half open file and resigns the white queen to defending a pawn
27,0,27,2Rad1,b'3r1rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/5pq1/1P1P2P1/P2Q1P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',This move seems uneccessary to me however it does mean that the queen can move away leaving only a rook defending the pawn
28,0,28,2f3,b'3r1rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/6q1/1P1P1pP1/P2Q1P1P/3R1RK1 w - -',This is a key move for me as it blocks off his bishop from the defence of the king. His options are limited now and taking the b pawn with that bishop is beginning to look like a mistake. My queen still has her eye on h3.
29,0,29,2Qe3,b'3r1rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/6q1/1P1PQpP1/P4P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',forced
30,0,30,2Rd4,b'5rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/3r2q1/1P1PQpP1/P4P1P/3R1RK1 w - -',This protects the c pawn that the black queen is eyeing up. with hindsight I think I should have been looking at doubling my rooks on f though I didn't realise it during the game
31,0,31,2Rdc1,b'5rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/3r2q1/1P1PQpP1/P4P1P/2R2RK1 b - -',Still after that pawn
32,0,32,2Qh3,b'5rk1/pB4pp/8/2p1P2n/3r4/1P1PQpPq/P4P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',Definitely too early. Rd-f4 would provide much more of a threat
33,0,33,2Bxf3,b'5rk1/p5pp/8/2p1P2n/3r4/1P1PQBPq/P4P1P/2R2RK1 b - -',All of a sudden my threats are reduced significantly
34,0,34,2Rxf3,b'6k1/p5pp/8/2p1P2n/3r4/1P1PQrPq/P4P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',I felt at the time that I needed the knight more than the rook. I still felt that the game was winnable at this point
35,0,35,Nf4,b'6k1/p5pp/8/2p1P3/3r1n2/1P1P1QPq/P4P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',HE can't take with the pawn or he loses his queen and if he moves the queen off the h1-a8 diagonal I can mate in one with Qg2
36,0,36,2Qa8+,b'Q5k1/p5pp/8/2p1P3/3r1n2/1P1P2Pq/P4P1P/2R2RK1 b - -',This is a distraction I figured I could get my king safe enough
37,0,37,2Rxc5,b'Q7/p4kpp/8/2R1P3/3r1n2/1P1P2Pq/P4P1P/5RK1 b - -',This is a mistake as my knight poses a far greater threat to his king as we shall see

74,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A 5 minute blitz game where I start to slightly panic due to low time but some hasty sacrifices later I produce a stunning checkmate.

120,4,3,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Control of center of the board is complete the king side bishop is now open to take back the material lost in the gambit
121,4,4,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1nppp/4p3/8/1bBPP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',This is a fairly standard opening for white. I don't have much of a clue what black is doing but as you can see he is under developed.

123,4,6,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2nppp/2p1p3/q7/3PP3/2PBBN2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Moving the queen out was foolish when the attack is so easily defended by a castle. I now have a partly open board on the left side and a back rank clear of material[with my king on the outside rather than in. This means i have developed 6 pieces and have them all in play. He only has a knight queen and rook in play and needs to develop them fast lest i can push my material advantage.
124,4,7,1Ne5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2nppp/2p1p3/4N3/3PP3/2qBB3/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',His queen comes in and I position my knight for an attack. I am going to bring it along the other side and trap his queen.

133,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The game begins with a king pawn opening which can lead to early tactics.
134,5,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black replies with a Sicilian an opening which creates the most opportunity to unbalance the game and offers black counter attacking chances.
135,5,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White responds with an out of sequence move. The usual move is 2.Nf3 which prepares the move d4.
136,5,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black follows through with the normal response to d4 of ...cxd4 which in this case will draw attention to d4 until the black pawn is captured.
137,5,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White continues with the out of sequence main line move of Nf3 which prepares Nxd4 the next move in sequence from this point. Black can not successfully save the pawn due to the double attack on it presently.
138,5,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues with a normal developing move. The intention is not to recapture as in [4.Nxd4 Nxd4  5.Qxd4]. The idea is to maintain central pressure of N vs N and influence on e5 and d4. Another reason for not wanting to recapture with the knight is because is takes a tempo that is better spent on further development.
139,5,6,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',Black develops a pawn with tempo. White is forced to move the knight.
140,5,7,Nxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2N5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White makes the choice of exchanging knights instead of a retreat to f3. This move regains the tempo because black is forced to recapture the knight to maintain material and to remove the threat on the queen.
141,5,8,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Capturing towards the center. This choice avoids an early exchange of queens which would put black at a disadvantage because the king is the only piece that could recapture thus losing castling rights. A line for the c8 bishop is opened and an ideal placement of ...Bb7 is considered for later.
142,5,9,a3,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White plays to prevent ...Bb4  but this move costs some development time. Better was [6.Bd3] to be followed by 0-0. If black plays [6...Bb4 ] then [7.Nc3] or [7.c3] will suffice.
143,5,10,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black develops with castling in mind. The move also attacks e4.
144,5,11,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White develops the bishop to protect the pawn and also prepare 0-0.
145,5,12,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black continues to develop in preparation for 0-0. The bishop is not developed to c5 where it is a target of b2-b4 and also not to d6 where it blocks the d7 pawn advance. The bishop also covers the knight in case of [8.Bg5].
146,5,13,Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This is a move favored by Kasparov in some Sicilians. In this position it does not seem to offer much pressure due to the bishop and queen protection of the knight but it could be used in an attempt to lure the move h7-h6 weakening the castle - although that move is not forced and the f6 knight can simply be moved to apply a counter attack on the g5 bishop.
147,5,14,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Black has almost completed back rank development. The king is safe and all that is needed is to move the bishop and queen from the back rank at some point so the rooks will be tied. The position is about equal.
148,5,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',White also has just to develop the queen and knight from the back rank to complete back rank development.
149,5,16,a5,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - a6',Black seeks to play positionally against queenside development in which the move b2-b4 is expected. If [10.b4] then [10...axb4] and now [11.axb4 is not possible due to the unprotected rook at a1.
150,5,17,1c4,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1P3/P2B4/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - c3',White plays against the center while black is playing against the flank. The key square of focus is d5.
151,5,18,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1P3/P2B4/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Black develops the bishop from the back rank in a diagonal that targets d5.
152,5,19,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1PP2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - f3',White switches to a kingside flank attack on the unprotected e5 pawn. If no pawn exchange occurs then f4-f5 will be uncomfortable for black as it seeks to cut off the black pieces from the king side of the board.
153,5,20,1exf4,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p5B1/2P1Pp2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Black alleviates the pressure mindful that the knight can incur an attack from e4-e5. There are 2 possible ideas for the knight the first is [12...Nd5 which attacks the undefended bishop while placing the black knight in danger of capture. If [13.Bxe7] then [13...Nxe7] and the knight is safe. Else if [13.exd5] then [13...Bxg5] and material balance remains. The second idea is to retreat the knight to e8 but this move offers no real counterplay.
154,5,21,1Rxf4,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p5B1/2P1PR2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 b - -',White recaptures with the rook into a slightly vulnerable square.
155,5,22,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p5/p2n2B1/2P1PR2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 w - -',A twin attack but it is not as effective as it would be if Bxe7 did not have the rook and queen targets. Now the move [13.Bxe7] is expected.
156,5,23,Nxe7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pnppp/2p5/p7/2P1PR2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 w - -',Material is still even. White has some need for development and a coordination of pieces. Black is a little closer to completing development but also has a need to coordinate pieces. Black does have inline rooks while white does not. Not a big factor at the moment but the f4 rook is hanging.
157,5,24,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/1b1pnppp/2p5/p7/2P1PR2/P2B4/1PQ3PP/RN4K1 b - -',White develops into a diagonal aligned battery which aims at h7. This move does overprotect the d4 pawn to work against the pawn push d7-d5. It is a defensive move that could turn to an attack.
158,5,25,1Ng6,b'r2q1rk1/1b1p1ppp/2p3n1/p7/2P1PR2/P2B4/1PQ3PP/RN4K1 w - -',The knight develops to a somewhat better square while attacking the rook to gain tempo and also blocking any attack on h7.
159,5,26,1Rf1,b'r2q1rk1/1b1p1ppp/2p3n1/p7/2P1P3/P2B4/1PQ3PP/RN3RK1 b - -',The rook returns to the back rank where it could be repositioned to the e file which would free the e4 pawn to move.
160,5,27,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1p1ppp/2p5/p3n3/2P1P3/P2B4/1PQ3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',Black deploys a blocking maneuver Tarasche-Steinitz style which also attacks the bishop which will force it into a less useful position.
161,5,28,1Be2,b'r2q1rk1/1b1p1ppp/2p5/p3n3/2P1P3/P7/1PQ1B1PP/RN3RK1 b - -',Even with the bishop positioned here it is not an easy task for black to mount an attack on the d4 pawn because white has the move [Nc3] providing enough support for the pawn.
162,5,29,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1p1ppp/8/p1p1n3/2P1P3/P7/1PQ1B1PP/RN3RK1 w - -',This move opens the bishop line to put (mostly psychological) pressure on e4. This move may not be the best in retrospect because of the weaknesses incurred at b5 and d5 which now become excellent outposts for the b1 knight.
163,5,30,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/1b3ppp/3p4/p1pNn3/2P1P3/P7/1PQ1B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',A very good move. The knight occupies an excellent square where it causes disruption to the movement of the black pieces. Note the influence on the squares that the black queen would have been able to use.
164,5,31,1Bc8,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/3p4/p1pNn3/2P1P3/P7/1PQ1B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black seeks to improve the position of the bishop which because it is a white squared piece is free from immediate attack by the knight. The idea is [19...Bg4] with the idea of exchanging a plan typical for black when in a cramped position. Note that the same squares that the queen is unable to use because of the d5 knight are the same squares that that knight is unable to use because of the queen.
165,5,32,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/3p4/p1pNn3/1PP1P3/P7/2Q1B1PP/R4RK1 b - b3',White can not play further in the center and now switches to the flank.
166,5,33,1axb4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/3p4/2pNn3/1pP1P3/P7/2Q1B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Either [...axb4] or [...cxb4] seem to be about equal choices.
167,5,34,Rxa1,b'2bq1rk1/5ppp/3p4/2pNn3/1PP1P3/8/2Q1B1PP/r4RK1 w - -',Continuing the plan to exchange pieces.
168,5,35,2c5,b'2bq1rk1/5ppp/3p4/2PNn3/1p2P3/8/2Q1B1PP/R5K1 b - -',Now the situation gets interesting. The game is leaning towards an endgame and could almost be considered to be in the early stages of such. White seeks to break up the center with this move. This is where I began to look at options calculating lines. [22...dxc5  23.Qxc5] leaves the b4 pawn under attack by the queen but does remove the threatening c5 pawn. Any other move results in [23.c6] and [24.c7] where the pawn becomes a serious threat. I could not find any moves that threatened either a piece or back rank mate and so exchanged the pawn on my move.
169,5,36,Ng6,b'2bq1rk1/5ppp/6n1/2QN4/1p2P3/8/4B1PP/R5K1 w - -',This move became an apparent necessity when I noticed that [24.Ne7 ] was possible.
170,5,37,2Qxb4,b'2bq1rk1/5ppp/6n1/3N4/1Q2P3/8/4B1PP/R5K1 b - -',Regaining material equality. This is where I sunk into thought trying to find a plan that could give me some advantage. I was aware of the potential risks along the back rank due to the queen line on my rook and from a pin by rook on the bishop but after looking at some potential moves for queen or bishop I found a plan to work against the harmony of the white pieces by using the queen.
171,5,38,2Qg5,b'2b2rk1/5ppp/6n1/3N2q1/1Q2P3/8/4B1PP/R5K1 w - -',This move offers a little threat of [25...Bh3] where the queen threatens mate on g2.
172,5,39,2Ra8,b'R1b2rk1/5ppp/6n1/3N2q1/1Q2P3/8/4B1PP/6K1 b - -',This move is a counter to the mate attempt but in moving the rook a weakness has been opened on the back rank.
173,5,40,2Qc1+,b'R1b2rk1/5ppp/6n1/3N4/1Q2P3/8/4B1PP/2q3K1 w - -',This move over protects the bishop at c8 while gaining a tempo by check. I had considered [26.Bf1] a response to this move. My next [26...Bg4?] is not good due to [27.Rxf8 Nxf8  28.Ne7  Kh8  29.Qxf8#] so I would be left with queen maneuvers. I gave [26...f5] a glance but it looked dangerous due to opening the white diagonal to the king. My move was made with the idea of creating counterplay in the way of a pin like white has put into play. I was seeking to find a method to trade queens but there seemed to be nothing available for that idea. I was essentially looking for a method to draw at this point in the game.
174,5,41,2Kf2,b'R1b2rk1/5ppp/6n1/3N4/1Q2P3/8/4BKPP/2q5 b - -',This move was the turning point for the game. I was happy to see this move because it meant that white would be running out of squares for the king. I felt the game shift to a slight advantage for black at this point. Better was [26.Bf1].
175,5,42,2f5,b'R1b2rk1/6pp/6n1/3N1p2/1Q2P3/8/4BKPP/2q5 w - f6',With the idea of bringing the rook into play.
176,5,43,2Qc3,b'R1b2rk1/6pp/6n1/3N1p2/4P3/2Q5/4BKPP/2q5 b - -',Seeking to trade queens but this is not a forcing move and black can continue with the plan of attacking with the rook.  In retrospect better was [27.Ne7  Nxe7  28.Qxe7] with control of the g5 square and the possibility of [29.Rxc8 Rxc8  30.Qe6  !] forking the king and rook gaining the rook.
177,5,44,2fxe4+,b'R1b2rk1/6pp/6n1/3N4/4p3/2Q5/4BKPP/2q5 w - -',There is no effective method to block the check without losing a piece. The king is forced towards the dangerous kingside where black has more resources.
178,5,45,Qg5+,b'R1b2rk1/6pp/6n1/3N2q1/4p3/2Q3K1/4B1PP/8 w - -',Black is fortunate that white has no pieces that can block the check effectively in this position either. The white king is completely immobilized and so has no escape squares. If [29.Bg4] then [29...Qxg4#] supported by the c8 bishop. White resigns.
179,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1.  When White plays e4 White can get a great number of replies!  The most common reply above 1900 elo is c5 - Sicilian - expectation of e4 c5 is 51%!!  White can expect to get e5 21-24% of the time!  When you decide to play the Kings Gambit (KG) you will need to know how to play against c5.  Keep in mind that playing e4 will get you only one KG every four or five games. 
180,6,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Black has several good responses here.  I play the Falkbeer Counter Gambit (FCG): e4 e5 f4 d5 exd5 exf4.  This exchange leaves the white pawn on d5 blocking the diagonal of his bishop from c4.  This delays White's attack.  The speed of the attack is critical to Whites' success.  
181,6,2,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I accept the Gambit because it is the move you will most often see in this position. 
182,6,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',It is critical for White to play Nf3 at this point.  The knight must remain on this post until the White King is safely castled.  The knight protects g5 and e4 against the Black Queen.  White needs to get castled quickly to get his pieces into play with threats.
183,6,4,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',This is the move Black plays most often.  I like Be7 better.
184,6,5,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',This is the major divergence point in the KG.  4. h4 is the Kieseritzki variation often called the Kings Knights Gambit.  4. Bc4 is the Philidor variation which then leads to other divergences: The Hanstein variation and the Muzio Gambit.  The Muzio was my primary weapon when I was young.
185,6,6,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is considered White's best move the other perhaps more popular playable move is Ng5.
186,6,7,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"There are eight (8) different moves that have been tried here.  The ones I believe you will see most are:
5. ... h5 the long whip variation.
5. ... Nf6 the Berlin variation.
5. ... d5 the Brentano variation. and
5.  ... d6 the Kolisch variation the move I make here because I believe it is the one you will see most."
187,6,8,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Be7 reveals the weakness created on White's kingside by moving the knight from f3 early.  Now Black bishop and queen bear down on h4 and white cannot defend with the knight.  This gives Black time to develop.  Still the game is even.  Blacks advantage just about equals the value of the gambited pawn.
188,6,9,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/8/2B1PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',We are still in the Kieseritzky but in a sideline.  6. ... Nf6 is more often played but Be7 is the second most popular move.  I played it to show what happens when the Knight leaves f3 - as he does in the Kieseritzky.  7. Qf3 may be best for White because after Bxh4 the knight can block with Nf2 and the Queen will support the knight.  By moving the Queen white also envisions a possible future 0-0-0.    
189,6,10,Kf1,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2B1PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',This move could become troublesome but it is playable if the plan is to get the knight back to f3.  
190,6,11,Qg5,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6q1/2B1PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',Black now attacks the knight twice and it must move or die.  The KG is a very tactical game.  Al
191,6,12,Nf2,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6q1/2B1Pp1b/8/PPPP1NP1/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',9. Withdrawal of the knight to f2 was appropriate at move 8.  It is no longer appropriate.  Now it was important to return the knight to f3 by 9.Nh2 and a later Nf3.   
192,6,13,1Bxf7+,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2B1p/3p4/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1bP1/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',Getting the Black king into the open without cost!  An easily found zwichenzug. 
193,6,14,1Kxf7,b'rnb3nr/ppp2k1p/3p4/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1bP1/RNBQ1K1R w - -',This puts the Black king out in the open on the same file as his opponent.
194,6,15,1Kxf2,b'rnb3nr/ppp2k1p/3p4/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1KP1/RNBQ3R b - -',The White king must recapture and a lone pawn stands on the file between the kings.  Both sides are relatively undeveloped and the side that can develop with threats will have the initiative.  Al  
195,6,16,1Nf6,b'rnb4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1KP1/RNBQ3R w - -',"Black gets several benefits from this tempo-saving move:
1.  e4 comes under attack.
2.  h7 and h5 are protected from incursion by the white rook.
3.  g4 is held for occupation by Queen Knight or Bishop.
4.  The knight can enter the attack on the next move. "
196,6,17,1d3,b'rnb4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/6q1/4Pp2/3P4/PPP2KP1/RNBQ3R b - -',"After 12. d3 developing the bishop with an attack and pin on f4 White is coming to life.  But it is already too late.  Look at Black's possible attacking responses:  Qg3  Ng4  Rg8 threatening g2.   These three seem very playable and the Black bishop bears down on g4.  It would be natural for Black to become giddy and play one of these moves.  Black would still win but he would create counter-chances for White with any of these moves.  ""When you see a good move look for a better one""  "
197,6,18,1Nc6,b'r1b4r/ppp2k1p/2np1n2/6q1/4Pp2/3P4/PPP2KP1/RNBQ3R w - -',Nc6 is probably the best move it develops another piece for the kingside attack and connects the rooks once the bishop moves.  Black has an advantage in time and material and will win if there is no blunder.  This move allows no counter-attack and positions the knight for d4 or d5.  As long as the pawns remain on the f-file the Black king is not subject to harassment.  Al
198,6,19,1c3,b'r1b4r/ppp2k1p/2np1n2/6q1/4Pp2/2PP4/PP3KP1/RNBQ3R b - -',White seems to be ignoring Blacks' attack.  True the best defence is an attack but White does not have enough pieces in play yet.  White needs a better plan.  By playing c3 the knight's best square is taken.  True he may come out via d2 but that square may be needed by the bishop!  It seems that White's best hope was in 13. Kf1 followed by Qf3.  This would support Bxf4 if the move is still available at that time and an exchange of queens to blunt Black's attack.    
199,6,20,Ne5,b'r1b4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/4n3/4Pp2/2PP2q1/PP4P1/RNBQ1K1R w - -',You can see that 13. c3 has bottled-up White.  The White queen can no longer to to f3 and the knight can no longer be developed to d2 without loss.  The White bishop has only one square the a1 rook has no square.  You may want to resign this one and we can look at another one.  You need to look at each of the moves in this game.  For the White moves ask: What moves are better?  For the Black moves ask: Did I see that when I played my move?  You need to do this in every game you play.  It is how you learn the better moves.  Al 
200,6,21,Nxd3,b'r1b4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/8/4Pp2/2Pn2q1/PP1N2P1/R1BQ1K1R w - -',There are no good moves for white.  Nd3 was as good as any.  The  Kings Gambit configuration works well for attack but can respond poorly in defense.  We'll work on it.  Al  
201,7,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An interesting sacrifice I had not seen before. I thought carefully and then decided to take the pawn and try and  hold on.
202,7,1,Bxe2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/5P2/2N5/8/PPPPBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',At this point I felt white had accomplished something by the queen exchange.True black gets one pawn back but white still has a pawn more and is not behind in development
203,7,2,c3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp3pp/3p1nb1/8/8/2P1N3/PP1PBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',White wants to build a strong pawn formation first.
204,7,3,1b3,b'2kr3r/ppp1b1pp/1n1p1nb1/8/3P4/1PP1N3/P2NBPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Here I felt White should have a win. This prepares to push pawns on the queenside hoping for exchanges into a favorable ending. But it does give Black a target. 
205,7,4,1Bb2,b'2kr3r/ppp1b1pp/3p1nb1/3n4/3P4/1PP1N3/PB1NBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I did not look hard enough at the knight capture on e3 opening the f file was not as advantageous for white as I had thought now I would prefer to exchange knights first and then play Bb2 and eventually advance the queen side pawns then exploit the kingside majority.
206,7,5,Rhf8,b'2kr1r2/ppp1b1pp/3p1nb1/8/3P4/1PP1P3/PB1NB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',here and on the next move black should have done more to restrain the backward pawn

210,7,9,2c4,b'3kr3/pp1nb1pp/2p3b1/8/2PP4/1P3B2/PB1N2PP/4R1K1 b - -',This move was made in haste. In retrospect I think White should have prepared more first. 
211,7,10,2Bf6,b'3kr3/pp1n2pp/2p2bb1/8/2PP4/1P3B2/PB1N2PP/4R1K1 w - -',Now the pawn is pinned. White must be careful now that ...c5 will be possible.

217,7,16,Nd7,b'8/1p1n1k1p/p4bp1/3P4/4B3/BP2K3/P5PP/8 w - -',Black has set up a solid defensive formation and wants to force an opposite color bishop ending.

222,7,21,a5,b'3b4/3n3p/1p1B1kp1/pP1P4/P1K1B3/8/6PP/8 w - -',White thinks that fixing the queen side pawns will restrict Black.

224,7,23,Ne8,b'3bn3/5k2/1p1B2p1/pP1P3p/P2K3P/6PB/8/8 w - -',This seems like a good defensive try but White has the desired position. First some forcing checks.

I'm quite imaginative perhaps but i think that black's odd opening is somewhat justified in this line: 2.d4Nf6; 3.Nc3 c5; So black could use later his h pawn for an attack even sacrifice it to open the h-file. At least this is what i'd do i i were in black having committed myself to h5. At this stage of the game probably h5 just a waste of time he can't know where i'm going to castle so what's the point?

The position is similar with that reached in the game but white as an easier development of his kingside pieces (not having a pawn on f3)
I have to admit that in the game i didn't even take in consideration a developing move like 4.Nf3 but probably this is much better than the idea of making black waste tempi wandering around with his knight

I reserve the possibility to take the knight later and black can't even react with h6!! Also it develops a piece.

Ok white still has the advantage and can calmly play 10.Be2 but i didn't like no more my bishop on f4 in this continuation. So i played the text move now 9...Qxb2 is just not possible in view of 10.Nxc7  (this time i don't have to waste a time defending from checkmate) and i have the threat of 10.Bc3.

We shall see what could happen if we played 9.Bf4Bb4 

10.Bd2 is too passive although after 10..Bxd2 ; 11.Qxd2 white clearly is happy
10.Nxb4 Qxf4; is not really what i had in mind when i thought about 9.Bf4

I don't think pushing the pawn one square further is good for black this does not look like a gambit but more like a blunder. Probably black though he could play a reversed sicilian like 1.e4 c5; 2.Nf3Nc6; 3.d4. See if you can spot the one small difference.
277,10,1,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',this seems the only move. Attempts by black to defend the pawn on e5 are not on the list here.

My plan here was to continue with simple development and build up a big center with d2-d4 and e2-e4 and after that see how black will fight to destroy it. I though this could be an interesting battle afterall...
281,10,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4Nb2/8/2P5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',this is really a blunder and deserves a double question mark.

350,13,11,1Be6,b'r3k1nr/1pp3pp/p1pbbq2/8/2Q1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',...Natch!

352,13,13,1Rf8,b'r3kr2/1pp1n1pp/p1pbbq2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',(!?) This move is fine but I might have been inclined to try 13...Kd7 with the view to swinging the a8-R over to the K-side - ...Rg8 say.  Along completely different lines 13...b5 is another idea threatening to dislocate the c3-N.
353,13,14,1a3,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbbqn1/8/4P3/P1NP4/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',(?) Takes from Black's DSB a square it doesn't want to reach.  Instead 15.Be3 seems to be called for.
354,13,15,1Qh4,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbb1n1/8/4P2q/P1NP4/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',(!?) Black launches her K-side attack with an immediate strike at h2.  Yet maybe she let her best chance slip right here.  I like the look of 15...Nf4(!) 16.Bxf4 Qxf4 17.g3 Qg4 18.Qxg4 (or 18.Qe3 Rf3; or 18.Qd2 Qf3) 18...Bxg4 19.f4 Bh3.  With the queens gone White's array of pawns will be a very problematical match for Black's bishop pair (and extra piece).
355,13,16,1f4,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbb1n1/8/4PP2/P1NP2Pq/1PP1Q2P/R1B2RK1 b - f3',(!?) Good though 17.Be3 first might have been even better.
356,13,17,1Bc5+,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1p1b1n1/2b5/4PP2/P1NP2Pq/1PP1Q2P/R1B2RK1 w - -',(?!) An attractive idea but maybe too straightforward an approach.  Black has several possible ways to attack and it is not easy in such circumstances to find the likeliest to break through.  A better alternative seems 17...Bg4! 18.Qf2 (covers the g1-a7 diagonal) 18...Ne5! (exploits the momentary pin on the f-file to bring the N into action) 19.Be3 (say) 19...Nf3  20.Kh1 Rf6 with an attack.  After 21.Qg2 Black can go all out: 21...Rh6! 22.Qxh3 Rxh3 23.Rf2 g5 ... You don't often see such ferocious looking attacks with the queens absent!
357,13,18,Bxe3+,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1p1b1n1/8/4PP2/P1NPb1Pq/1PP1Q2P/R4RK1 w - -',"(?!) Still preferable seems 18...Bg4 hoping for 19.Qf2? Rxf4!  Of course White will play 19.Qd2 whereat Black can no little better than retire the c5-B to e7.  Note that I mentioned Black (in this instance) ""hoping for"" this or that response.  This is fine if you have already planned a good followup to your opponent making a different and better move.  Where it becomes Heisman's ""Hope Chess"" is when you have no such followup planned ahead of time."
358,13,19,Bg4,b'r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1p3n1/8/4PPb1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP4P/R4RK1 w - -',(!?) Was it already time for Black to cut and run?  19...Qh6 would allow Black to take a breather.

That central pawn phalanx it seems to me would be well worth a piece once  Black's Q and B are left stranded behind enemy lines with no clear means of extraction.  Now however Black gets a second chance...
360,13,21,2b6,b'r3kr2/2p3pp/ppp3n1/8/4PPb1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP2R1P/R5K1 w - -',(?!) But it's psychologically difficult to recognise that it is time to cut one's losses.  This move maybe keeps the WQ out of c5 and plans ...c5 shortly.  But Black hasn't time for this.  20...Qh6 was still indicated.  Note that it momentarily stops 21.f5 owing to the pin along the Queen's diagonal. 
361,13,22,2f5,b'r3kr2/2p3pp/ppp3n1/5P2/4P1b1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP2R1P/R5K1 b - -',(!) Fine move.  Black's B and Q are cut off from the main army.  
362,13,23,2Ne5,b'r3kr2/2p3pp/ppp5/4nP2/4P1b1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP2R1P/R5K1 w - -',(!?) Probably Black's best chance.  21...Ne7 22.Qg5 Rf7? 23.Rf4! h5 24.Nd1 Bxd1 (essential: 25.Nf2 was threatened) 25.Rxd1 and the only way to save the WQ is by 25...Nxf5.  Instead of 22...Rf7 22...Qh5 is an improvement but White must have the edge after 23.Qxg7. 
363,13,24,2Raf1,b'r3kr2/2p3pp/ppp5/4nP2/4P1b1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP2R1P/5RK1 b - -',(?!) Too slow maybe?  More incisive is 22.Qf4 Nd7 23.Qxc7.   Black can improve by fighting her way clear by giving up 2 minor pieces for a rook: 22.Qf4 Nf3 !? 23.Rxf3 Bxf3  24.Qxf3 Kf7 with the view to ...Kg8 and a measure of safety.  At two pawns down for the exchange Black would still have a fighting chance to save the game.
364,13,25,2Rd8,b'3rkr2/2p3pp/ppp5/4nP2/4P1b1/P1NPQ1Pq/1PP2R1P/5RK1 w - -',(!?) Black could also have tried once more to cut and run: 22...Qh6 23.Qxh6 gxh6.  But it doesn't look very enticing.  But now White has another opportunity to assert his dominance.
365,13,26,2Ne2,b'3rkr2/2p3pp/ppp5/4nP2/4P1b1/P2PQ1Pq/1PP1NR1P/5RK1 b - -',(?) But not this way.  With 23.Qf4 Nd7 24.Qxc7 Qh6 25.e5 White would have had a strong attack.  After the game move Black could have turned the game back to around about evens once more.
366,13,27,2Bxe2,b'3rkr2/2p3pp/ppp5/4nP2/4P3/P2PQ1Pq/1PP1bR1P/5RK1 w - -',(!) 
367,13,28,Ng4,b'3rkr2/2p3pp/ppp5/5P2/4P1n1/P2P2Pq/1PP1QR1P/5RK1 w - -',(?!) Insisting on attack.  Instead 24...Qh6 and Black ought to be able to consolidate a defence (e.g. ...c5 to maintain the N on e5) after which there are prospects the extra piece will eventually come into its own.
368,13,29,2e5,b'3rkr2/2p3p1/ppp5/4PP1p/5Rn1/P2P2Pq/1PP1Q2P/5RK1 b - -',(!) Classic instance of a central counteraction against a flank operation.    White has the advantage now.
369,13,30,2e6,b'4kr2/2pr2p1/ppp1P3/5P1p/5Rn1/P2P2Pq/1PP1Q2P/5RK1 b - -',(!?) Better was 27.d4 in my view: maintaining a close-order advance.

Much better was 28...Re5! and after 29.Qd2 Ke7 Black seems to have sufficiently solid defence to hold on.  She could even try the more aggressive 29...g5!?  30.fxg6 e.p. Rxf4 31.Rxf4 Rg5 (NOT 31...Re1  32.Qxe1 Qxh2  33.Kf1 and Black runs out of attack) 32. Rf2 (say) Rxg6 with a battle still in front of both players.  White would have had no alternative to 29.Qd2 either: [A] 29.Qg2?? Qxg2 ! 30.Kxg2 Ne3  wins for Black as does [B] 29.Qc2? Rexf5!! 30.Rxf5 Qxf1!! 31.Kxf1 (31.Rxf1 Rxf1  is simpler for Black) 31...Rxf5 !! (astonishing move!) 32.Ke1 (say) Rf1 !! 33.Kxf1 Ne3  recovers the queen and wins!  An extraordinary line: at move 32 only Kf1-e2 averts the fork but gets the skewer ...Rf2  instead.

A questa ho gi� analizzato che bisogna muovere l'alfere a h2 per non perdere un tempo preziosissimo se il nero spinge f5-f4. 
La mossa complementaria delle bianche � Dd3. 
Se viene giocata prima il nero risponde Cd5 il bianco ritira l'alfiere in h2 e adesso la donna si pu� ritirare solo in a5 e da l� con Tb5 vince perch� poi prende il cavallo d5. 
Il nero ha una mossa per parare questo inconveniente e la pi� aggressiva (a parte ritirare la donna in b4 subito e poi impedire Tb5 con a6) f5-f4. 
Il dubbio qui � se ritirare il cavallo o di lasciarlo giocando Tfb1.
Se F5xCe4 Dxe4 e la risposta naturale Cf6 mi fa perdere un tempo prezioso ma alla fine nessuno mi potr� impedire di prendere prima o poi il pedone in c3. 
Se il cavallo si ritira per esempio in g3 (la pi� brutta) non pu� ancora ritirare la donna in d6 perch� con Cf5 poi mangio l'alfiere in g8 lasciandomi con un finale vantaggioso. Se invece la ritira in a5 per continuare a difendere il pedone con Tb1 continuo l'attacco. Prevedibilmente a6 Ac4 e la mia posizione � migliore. 
Se invece il cavallo si ritira avanzando a c5 la mia minaccia rimane ma se gioca b6 il mio cavallo va a b3 e comunque non � male. "

Though my awkward play on this game may have caused a bit of confusion for my opponent. At the time of this game his score was not 1555 due to his timeouts but 1555 is his score at this time. Please feel free to comment. I know if I played him again he would probably do 1000 things different. I should have lost this one.

This move cost me a pawn but only if White allows me to open up the g-file. It was careless if I'm honest I hadn't analysed the position enough and did not see that White could take the lead."

Key move. I think it's bad though I might be wrong. It certainly allowed my WS Bishop to dominate later proceedings. Omus even said straight after that perhaps he shouldn't have played this move. Of course being a pawn up I can understand why he would want to further weaken my pawn structure whilst simplifying the board but he certainly misses this Bishop later."

I think this move should cost White the pawn he has gained. Perhaps Kh1 was better."

480,19,14,1Rae8,b'4r1rk/2q2p1p/p1pbbp2/2p5/8/3P2NP/PPP2PPK/R3QRN1 w - -',Better than doubling up the Rooks on the g-file. Threatens to force the Queen off e1 and thus finally win back the pawn.

That's the move he was hoping I wouldn't make! Omus even said he hoped I had gone too early though if I waited he would play R(a)e1 and tidy up his position nicely. Also this move makes it easier for my WS Bishop to dominate as White no longer has a piece he can trade it for without giving me the lead."
484,19,18,2Qxe2,b'6rk/2q2p1p/p1pb1p2/2pb4/8/3P2NP/PPP1QPPK/R4R2 b - -',What choice now?

My initial analysis suggested this line would take me to an endgame featuring either the two Queens and me with a two pawn lead or an equal material endgame with just Kings and pawns with my King winning the race to the other side. But this analysis may be flawed and perhaps I would only have found myself a pawn up with a lot of work still to do. Still I'd rather have had the two Bishops than the extra Rook.

I think this is the move that ensured I had a won endgame coupled with my next one. I didn't like the idea of White having two rooks there were just too many variables for a player of my ability to analyse. I didn't think my Rook was my key piece and felt I had more to gain by simplifying the position."

I think this puts White in zugzwang. If he moves his Rook off the e-file my King can sneak through. If he moves his pawn my King will capture him shortly after. If he moves his Rook to e7 or e8 my Bishop can close the file and I'd be looking to play f3 Kf4 and then f5 while he moves his Rook back around to the back row where it needs to be. If he moves his King to e2 my King moves to e4. If he moves his King anywhere else he's losing ground  and will find himself committed to defending his h3 pawn. So White has just one choice left..."

At this point the Gameknot database has 2 games one where black wins and one white so I guess the game is evenl;y balanced though I prefer blacks position the white queen seems awkwardly placed to me and whites dsb isn't going anywhere fast"

The d7 pawn is well guarded. There is no secondary objective of creating a double attack on king and queen by the knight. So the answer was to find a way to move the king to e8 and also to remove the knight at c6 so that the queen can finally use the e7 square for mate. The answer involved repositioning the knight at f6 while producing check.

It is possible that the Nb5 maneuver was not in fashion back at the time this program was created and so maybe it was not in its book. I was lucky to have considered it because of seeing it in some Kasparov games that I have been studying. This was a very pleasing win considering how many times the AI has beaten me. I am going to enjoy this while I can in case it is my only win against this level.

I can of course dial the level down to a lower elo and do play at lower levels. But I wanted to see what would happen if I played up some.

I figure in every game at least one person has to be attacking and if my opponent wants to be passive then it must be me who should be doing the attacking. (Don't worry he'll punch back soon enough.) 
I don't remember which pawn I was planning to take back with if he captures the knight. Maybe I hadn't decided because there's things I like about both. I like giving my rook a half-open file with fxe4. But I also like the threat of moving the pawn to f4. Yeah I'd probably recapture with the d-pawn for that reason. But I don't think he wants to trade off that bishop for the knight so I didn't think I'd have to face that choice and he can't take with the knight because my pawn forks his knight & bishop."

If I'd given him time to play Ndf3 he could recapture with a knight and the only way I'd ever get rid of the knight from that outpost would be to trade off my strong bishop. The way it stands now he'll have a pawn on e5 and the square won't be of any value for his knight.

It gives his bishop on b2 a little more scope and keeps the kingside a little bottled up.

I guess he wants to keep it on the kingside -- he's conceding that I have the initiative and he can't afford to move any more pieces away from the kingside and maybe he plans to use it to block on h3 or go to e2 and f4 after he moves the queen.

Maybe he's thinking that his trap here is stronger than it really is. It may be that he sees that if I have a rook on the f-file he no longer has any threats at f8. And after I take back with the rook that pawn on e3 will still ultimately fall.

No family around so why not. In fact you'll appreciate this ...

I built a decision tree until about 1 or 1:30 in the morning looking at about two dozen lines. I was hoping for Bb2 because I'd get to play d4. If I got to that point I could trade queens and win that endgame despite opposite color bishops. Every line I looked at won for me except for one Qf3 because I'd have to trade queens I felt and then I didn't see a way to force a win in the endgame.

Every Pawn move should be considered a waste of 3 tempo. the reason is very simple it takes in general 3 moves before that pawn becomes a threat. 2ndly this Pawn does nothing for the center. REMBER: Every pawn move also leaves a weakness in front and behind it.

I was here that I paused...and took a Deep look at my opponent. You can learn a much from your Opponents from his games. What pieces he prefers... the tact..and strategies...and most of all what he knows and doesn't. This character holds back his knights til the end game doesn't know how to use his Bishops...and dislikes trading pawns...Prefers closed games to open ones... rarely castles. Trades Queens. and always plays this weird line!!!! I began to Assess my Basics and deeply.Chaos was a comming.^-^So first I gave reason for the bishop (who is Pinning a ghost at the moment a reason to be there.
