I was so relieved to be playing another game with Coach Ion after he was involved in the Christchurch Earthquake.  This game is part of a MT to commemorate players caught up in the Japanese Earthquake.  Back to our game however it seems the same old story.  Jo gets a reasonable game until late into the middlegame against the Experts and Masters and then passivitis sets in.  Coach Ion inflicted that ailment on me all right.  To see how just play this through and look at the Gameknot Analysis link which is as follows:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15586699&rnd=0.7010855109933332"

This move was recommended in the World DB but it does have the drawback of leaving that pawn out on a limb which is what happens in this game.
317,16,4,1a5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/P3p3/1p2P3/1B1P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',10. a5 - puts a little cramp on black's queenside but see my earlier note.

He robs me of a pawn in broad daylight.  I realise to my horror that it is the pawn I must deliver or Henry loses his life.  If I play PXR it is #3.  Can you see the mate?

However as Ion pointed out during the game his prelate will be a monster piece in this endgame and my knight will be no match for it whatsoever boy was he right!

After one more move I decided that I would not be able to prevent Ion from crowning the f pawn without giving up my knight and there is always that h pawn.  Well played Ion - Joanne

337,17,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I have been playing the sicilian more lately but I still prefer kings indian games. 
338,17,2,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',one of the strengths of sicilian from black's point of view is that he can setup a meriad of pawn structures to suit his style of play. Here I am aiming for a hedgehog formation with pawns on e6 d6 and a6.
339,17,3,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I played this to test white and see what kind of mood he was in. If he follows up with g4 then I know he wants to fight. 
340,17,4,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',A solid line but this move does not give black too much trouble. In fact it allows black to achieve his openning objectives unmalested. 
341,17,5,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',putting the bishop on e3 instead of G5 is becoming very fashionable lately. It is easy to understand why because on g5 the bishop get harassed and white has not really gotten any serious advantage from it. Plus the bishop on e3 is actually more flexible than on g5. From here it eyes the d4 square and can assist with queenside attacking stratagies. 
342,17,6,Ndb5,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/1N6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',an exicting idea but a bit too aggressive. The forced move for black Qb8 is actually not to bad because the queen is well position on the b8-h2 diagonal and can support pawn thrusts from safety. The disadvantage of Qb8 is that the A rook is going to be hard to develop.

399,19,2,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p1np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I planned on multiple captures involving the knights and bishops to end up Qb6 attacking the f-pawn. I like the queen on b3b6g3g6 These I find are good squares for the queen
400,19,3,Re1,b'r2qkb1r/1p2pppp/p1bp1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',!? Nxc6 bxc6 means this move is not needed
401,19,4,1f4,b'r2qkb1r/1p2pp1p/p1bp1np1/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQR1K1 b kq f3',I would have preferred Bg5 followed by f4 because I wouldn't castle Queen side because of the half open c-file my Queen is on
402,19,5,bxc6,b'r2qk2r/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Finally the multiple captures have taken place so I can play Qb6+
403,19,6,1Kh1,b'r3k2r/4ppbp/pqpp1np1/8/4PP2/2N5/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1R2K b kq -',Not  Qe3 Qxe3 Bxe3 which I think would be better because his e and f pawns are cramping me and also because my minor pieces are stuck in a corner they aren't in the best places to attack and my only real threat is Rb8 controlling the half open b-file which can easily be defended with b3 and also e5 dxe5 fxe5 causes knight to move + with Rook on e-file defends the pawn if the Bishop on e3 moves.
404,19,7,1O-O,b'r4rk1/4ppbp/pqpp1np1/8/4PP2/2N5/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1R2K w - -',Completes my King side defence and also compounds the fact that Qe3 Qxe3 Bxe3 would have been better than Kh1
405,19,8,fxe6,b'r4rk1/6bp/pqpppnp1/8/4P3/2N5/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1R2K w - -',Gives me control of the half open f-file I would have preferred e5 dxe5 fxe5 Nh5 which puts my Knight onto the corner
406,19,9,1Nd1,b'r4rk1/6bp/p1ppp1p1/8/4P1n1/3QB3/PqP3PP/R2NR2K b - -',"?? Na4 would have been better because this allows Qxa1 loses the rook

18.Na4 also stops ... Qc3 Qxc3 Bxc3 which forks both rooks

"
407,19,10,2Qxe6+,b'r4rk1/6bp/p1p1Q1p1/8/4P3/4n3/P1P3PP/q2NR2K b - -',?? This means the Knight just took the Bishop for free with any capture of the knight resulting in checkmate. This also means if black wants to survive and play h3 black gets 2 free minor pieces and is up by 10
408,19,11,Nf2+,b'r4r1k/6bp/p1p3p1/8/2Q1P3/7P/P1P2nP1/q3R2K w - -',"!! 23.Kh2 Be5+ 24. Kh1 Qxe1# or 24.Kg1 Qxe1 25. Qf1 Nxh3+ means queen is lost and goes down by even more. 24.g3 loses the rook and so once again the points is in such a bad position its not worth it.

Lessons to learn

1.) Make sure if back rank mate is a possibility don't move pieces that can stop it
This may seem like common sense but 20.Qxe6+?? may have seen like an OK move but because of the threat of back rank it turned out to cost white the game.(Although he was already down by 4 points)
2.) When facing attacks on rooks on the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals always make sure you can protect these
3.) b3b6g3g6 are generally good squares for the queen as they force the opposition to be on guard for a possible mate and also means they can quickly hope onto the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals"
409,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Yes I seriously am calling it that. You will see why throughout the game. Both players use their Knights with great skill and the only reason that it turned out the way it did was because of those Knights.
410,20,1,Bh6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1pb/2p3N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I was trying something new here. I am unsure of the actual accuracy of this move but I wanted to mix things up a bit.

412,20,3,O-O-O,b'2kr2r1/1bqp1p1p/p1n1pnpQ/1pp3N1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',The wrong move in this case.
413,20,4,Rdf8,b'2k2rr1/1bqp1N1p/p1n1pnpQ/1pp5/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',A case of the wrong Rook.
414,20,5,Nh5,b'2k2rr1/1bqp3p/p1n1p1pQ/1pp3Nn/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',A big blunder.
415,20,6,Rxg8,b'3k2r1/1bq4p/p1n3pQ/1pp4n/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',So you see where White used his Knight to gain the advantage.
416,20,7,Kxc7,b'6r1/1bk4p/p5p1/1p2n2n/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',White should win this...
417,20,8,2Kh1,b'6r1/1bk4p/p5p1/1p6/4Pn2/2NP1nP1/PPP2P1P/R4R1K b - -',My Knight rade has begun.
418,20,9,3Rh3,b'5r2/8/p5p1/3k3p/Pp5P/1PnP1nPR/2P2PK1/R7 b - -',He traps his Rook in.
419,20,10,Rxc2,b'8/8/p5p1/3k3p/Pp1n3P/1P1P2PR/2r1nP2/4RK2 w - -',I'm slowly recovering material.
420,20,11,Nxe1,b'8/8/p1k5/5R1p/Pp3n1P/3P4/2r2P2/4nK2 w - -',My Knights have served their purpose.
421,20,12,b3,b'8/8/p1k5/5R1p/P6P/1p1n4/2r2P2/5K2 w - -',He resigns when he realizes that the pawn cannot be stopped. The game was titled this way for a reason and it once more shows why Knights are my favorite Minor piece over Bishops.

532,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A common opening move
533,25,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',and a usual reply
534,25,2,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',A very weak move giving up a pawn for virtually nothing.
535,25,3,Bxb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So black correctly captures
536,25,4,c3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b2P3/2P5/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the best follow-up preparing d4 with a strong centre.
537,25,5,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2P5/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I think it would have been better to drop the Bishop back to a5 so if White plays d4 Black can play exd4 and White cannot recapture with the pawn. White would ideally like to set up a pawn centre with pawns on e4 and d4.
538,25,6,d4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So White sets up his centre. There are a couple of games in the Gameknot opening database with this position. After 4. d4 exd4 5. cxd4 Bb6 6. Bb2 Qf6 7. Qf3 Bxd4 8. Qxf6 Bxf6 9. Bxf6 Nxf6 10. Nc3 O-O 11. Bd3 Nc6 12. Nf3 Re8 13. O-O Nb4 14. Bb1 d6 15. a3 Nc6 16. Nb5 Re7 17. Re1 Bg4 18. Nd2 a6 19.

Kh2 in aeros (1724) vs. jerad (1582) Black played Nh5 and went on to win and .....Ra3 was played in the other game. I like exd4 5. cxd4 Bb4 in this position.
539,25,7,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/4p3/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But instead Black just up his extra pawn.
540,25,8,dxe5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/4P3/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Which White gladly takes!
541,25,9,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And Black returns the Bishop to the nice c5 square. 
542,25,10,Be3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/4P3/2P1B3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',So White decides to exchange off the strong Bishop.
543,25,11,Na6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/n7/2b1P3/4P3/2P1B3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',It would have been better for Black to exchange on e3 and leave White with weak tripled pawns on e3 e4 and d5
544,25,12,Bc4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/n7/2b1P3/2B1P3/2P1B3/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White develops and ignores a chance to prevent his pawns becoming weaker.
545,25,13,Bxe3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/n7/4P3/2B1P3/2P1b3/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',So Black now exchanges
546,25,14,fxe3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/n7/4P3/2B1P3/2P1P3/P5PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White has to recapture to avoid losing material.
547,25,15,Nc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P3/2B1P3/2P1P3/P5PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',and Black re-centres his knight.
548,25,16,Qd5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2nQP3/2B1P3/2P1P3/P5PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',This is a strong move by white attacking the knight on c5 and the pawn on f7. Can you see how Black could have defended both?
549,25,17,b6,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2nQP3/2B1P3/2P1P3/P5PP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Black defends the knight but not f7. By Qe7 Black could have defended both or Black could have met both threats by Ne3 and Black would have had a good game. b6 as well as not defending against the mate on f7 leaves the rook on a8 open for White to grab.
550,25,18,1Qxf7#,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pp1Qpp/1p6/2n1P3/2B1P3/2P1P3/P5PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',
551,26,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Playing against a very strong player I decided to use the Sicilian defense  in which I lost a few games but this game went well for me. My opponent suddenly lost many games on time  and I too benefited. However I learnt how to play against the English attack.
552,26,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Book moves of the Sicilian Najdorf until now. The game can branch off into many variations from here.
553,26,2,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The English attack which has become popular. In the old days this move was considered premature as World champion Euwe suggested that 6. f3 should precede Be3 otherwise Black can attack the bishop on e3 with Ng4. Gary Kasparov Vishy Anand played this variation which I used in this game.
554,26,3,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP1n1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',At first sight this knight move looks like a novice attack but it is not so simple.
555,26,4,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppb1/p2p3p/6p1/3NP1n1/2N3B1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black's position looks compromised on the king side with advanced pawns but this variation has stood the test of Grandmaster play. Kasparov says he analyzed it and included in his repertoire. This aggressive play by Black have taken the game into new territory away from well analyzed lines. White's bishop on g3 will remain passive for quite a while and stands in the way of the natural pawn storm on the king side.
556,26,5,1h3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppb1/p2p3p/6p1/3NP1n1/2N3BP/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White questions the Black knight.

561,26,10,1c3,b'r2q1rk1/1p4b1/p1n1p1np/3p2p1/8/2P1N1BP/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White tries to neutralize the Black bishop on the long diagonal.

570,26,19,Rd7,b'7k/1p1r2b1/p2Qp2p/3p2q1/6r1/2PNRpP1/PP3P2/5RK1 w - -',A terrific Rook sac if accepted leads to mate in three moves. 33. Qxe7 Rxg3+ 34. fxg3 Qxg3+ 35. Kh1 Qg2 mate. My opponent is a very strong player so he does not allow it.
571,26,20,Rg8,b'6rk/1pQ3b1/p6p/3pp1q1/6r1/2PN1RP1/PP3P2/5RK1 w - -',Black's heavy artillery is getting into dangerous positions.

577,26,26,Rd7,b'8/3r3k/p6p/8/3p4/1Rb2NP1/P4K2/8 w - -',White defended very well from here.
578,26,27,Rxa4,b'5k2/1R6/7p/p7/r2pK1P1/2b2N2/8/8 w - -',The pawn drops off and here my opponent lost on time as he probably did not feel like resigning. It was a satisfying effort by Black against a very strong opponent. Bishop vs knight ending with 3 pawns against one.
579,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My usual opening which I play looking for a Sicilian or a Roy Lopez
580,27,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Caro-Kann an opening I had little experience facing. It seems that the Caro-Kann was one of the most played openings alongside Indian Defences at the club.

582,27,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I wasn't a fan of the exchange variation or the Panov-Botvinnik attack or the advance Caro-Kann
583,27,4,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Not 4... Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 or gxf6 which is what I had faced in my little experience of playing the Caro-Kann
584,27,5,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',My Opening book suggested 5.Ng3
585,27,6,Bxe4,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3qb3/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',It took some time to decide whether to capture with the Bishop or the queen.
586,27,7,Qxe4,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3qQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',I decided to trade queens because with a 2 Bishops and the center looking rather open I thought my Bishop would be better than a knight and so I wanted to trade.
587,27,8,Qd8,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4Q3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Interesting move because Not only does he lose a tempo when he is already one tempo down but he also loses his only developed piece and so loses two tempi. If he had have played Qxe4 Bxe4 Nf6 he could have made me lose a tempo.
588,27,9,b3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4Q3/1P1B4/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',I planned on Castling Queenside and wanted my bishop on the long diagonal.

Also at e3 Nd5 attacks the Queen and forces me to move it again.
591,27,12,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',After I made Qf3 I expected e6 straight away I saw no other good move. g7 to try and fianchetto his bishop but It gave him no attack on the Light center squares.
592,27,13,1Ne2,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',This was forced as Bb2 Bb4+ causes me to weaken the position of my DSB with c3 or lose the right to castle. However this does nothing to stop it but It means If I can play Bb2 before Bb4+ I can play Nc3
593,27,14,1O-O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPPP/2KR3R b - -',This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think
594,27,15,1Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPPP/2KR3R w - -',Now for a long time after this I was still thinking of a Classic Bishop Sac

599,27,20,1Qe4,b'r4rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3nq3/4Q1PP/1PPB4/P3NP2/2KR3R b - -',This forced a queen exchange although I was a pawn down I thought with some good endgame results recently I had 3 wins and 1 draw in all end games I had recently including a win when a pawn down and a draw when a pawn down and so I was excited at that thought. I also thought that we would probably draw with an opposite coloured bishop ending.

1.) Don't accept exchanges of knights for Bishops in open positions.

Master Chrisobee one of my Master buddies kindly invited me to a mini-tournament containing mostly Masters and Experts and two GRANDMASTERS!  I lost both my games to Ruwurtinger (whose rating was over 2500 at the time) then I found myself paired up against the Gameknot Grandmaster that every chessplayer on Gameknot has been dreaming of playing - that is GM CYRANO!  Here I find myself playing against a Sicilian Naijdorf in which we both play book moves for the first 15 moves.  I will talk you through them.  There is also a Gameknot Analysis link to this game which is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15425960&rnd=0.49847992558701476"
661,29,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxd4 - I decided to tread on familiar ground in the Sicilian.  Occasionally I deviate on move 2 with either c3 d3 or even f4 but I felt I would rather revert to book as at least I am becoming familiar with this opening.
662,29,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5. .... a6 - here is the Naijdorf - this little pawn move supports a later b5 which will lead to a queenside pawn storm as white normally castles on the queenside in the Naijdorf and Yugoslav Attack of the Sicilian Dragon which then involves an exciting race of whose king topples first sometimes that Chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey doesn't quite know where to look as one mating threat may move from one side to another!!
663,29,3,f3,b'rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',8. f3 - this sequence now transposes into the Fisher-Byrne Attack.  It is called an attack because if black should castle on the kingside a white pawn storm can sometimes appear out of nowhere with moves such as g4 and h4 being the start of it.
664,29,4,Qd2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',9. Qd2 - a fairly standard stance for Glenda (my queen) to adopt.  Should a black pawn move to g6 then Fou Lenoir can get into h6 defended by Glenda (now when is that poor put upon lassie not defending something?!)
665,29,5,1O-O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',10. 0-0-0 - both kings castle on opposite wings as I mentioned in a previous note.  For a long time Glenda will sit on d2 doing nothing but defend Fou Lenoir and at the same time darn a much needed new pair of medieval stockings for her beloved seafood loving other half Henry so that he doesn't catch cold if and when his castled position becomes just a little draughty.
666,29,6,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P1P1/1NN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - g3',11. g4 - see my previous note on move 8.

668,29,8,1exd5,b'r2q1rk1/3nbppp/p2p4/1p1Pp1Pn/8/1N2BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - -',14. exd5 - on my last move I tried to establish a decent outpost for my knight on d5.  At least this has made black give up his light square bishop for it to remove it and more pertinently the bishop pair.  I now establish a pawn on d5 to try and cramp Afro's (GM Cyrano's) style.
669,29,9,1Na5,b'r2q1rk1/3n2pp/p2p1b2/Np1Pp2n/8/4BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - -',16. Na5 - still book.  There is a possibility of establishing that knight on c6.  In this game however that knight never quite gets there.
670,29,10,exf4,b'r3qrk1/3n2pp/p2p1b2/Np1P4/5p2/5P1B/PPPQ3P/2KR3R w - -',18. ..... exf4 - this gives black an isolated queen pawn on d6.
671,29,11,2Qe2,b'r3qr1k/6pp/p2p1b2/Np1Pn3/4Rp2/5P1B/PPP1Q2P/2KR4 b - -',21. Qe2 - Glenda moves onto the e column to indirectly pile up on the knight on e5.  It is always a good idea to have a rook on the same file as The Wicked Witch of the West (enemy queen) no matter how many pieces are in front of it.

Against a mighty GM whose rating was nearly as high as Gary Kasparov's I would rather draw a line under it so after Afro advanced his pawn to e3 I decided to wave the white flag.  This game is a salutary lesson of the power of two connected passed pawns in the late middlegame.

Does White want to trade the versatile knight in this closed position for his strong light bishop which normally goes on the d3 square?  Only about a dozen players over 2100 have played this move.  Definitely some advantage for black now.  Two best responses are block pin with Bd7 or continue with thematic Qb6 earlier than normal.  I chose Qb6 thinking it would force the trade or bring more play to the queenside where I have a space advantage.  I thought the line would progress 5...Qb6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 with my side pawn toward the center which would soon continue to pressure d4.

For instance it is plausible that after d5 or d5 White could play c4 and transpose to a symmetrical English or Benoni respectively with colours reversed. Similarly after e5 a Sicilian is reached this is why I like to play Nf6 and retain flexibility

There aren't any tactical resources to give the pawn away thankfully. There are often tricks with Na3 and Nb5 exploiting wk dark squares in d4 d5 openings but the fianchetto of the light squared bishop kills these off
859,36,4,axb3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/1PP2NPP/1P2PPB1/RN2K2R b KQkq -',This line is very forcing and gives Black the better pawn structure but White the more active pieces. It gives quite a bit of scope for outplaying though and I didn't fancy a dull game

861,36,6,Bb5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/1b1pN3/3P4/1P4PP/1P2PPB1/R3K2R w KQ -',The bishop proves to be something of a thorn in White's side from this square whilst the knight isn't doing any damage for the time being although out-posted on e5.

Rxc1 Rxc1 Bxf3 Nxf3 h6 Rc7 a5 Rxb7 a4 bxa4 Rxa4 Ne5 Ra1+ Kg2 Rd1 Rxf7 Rxd4 would have been the way to steer through the position and stay a pawn up as Re6 Re4 holds thanks to the trick of Rxe6?? Nd7.

In truth Rxa7 Rf8 Nxf3 Rxb3 is nowhere near as strong as Rxa7 was the previous turn
