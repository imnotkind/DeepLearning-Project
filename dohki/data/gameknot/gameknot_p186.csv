22,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

This game was viewed as a success because although it is a draw on paper any Expert Draw is a moral victory at least at the moment!  The Petrov starts off as 1. e4 e5 Nf3 and then Nf6 instead of the usual Nc6.  The Petrov has been discussed a little more in my previous annotation against dtdominates in which I won.  So we pick up the action from move 5 where Dave deviated from that game with Nc3 instead of d3."
23,1,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nc3 - in my previous Petrov game dtdominates played 5. d3 - he went on to lose that game.  This knight move leads to a trade of knights on c3.
24,1,2,dxc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/8/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',6. dxc3 - Dave captures with the d pawn rather than the b pawn.  Dave is planning to put his queen the Wicked Witch of the West on d5 and so this pawn recapture opens up the d file for that purpose.
25,1,3,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np4/1B6/8/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',8. ...... Be7 - solid development here.
26,1,4,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2np4/1B6/8/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',9. ..... 0-0 - time for Henry to be tucked away on the kingside and sidestep a potentially nasty pin down the e column.  However here comes ......
27,1,5,1Qd5,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2np4/1B1Q4/8/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',10. Qd5 ...... the Wicked Witch of the West ssss!  I think she is now planning to fly over to h5 to bear down on my h7 pawn nasty nasty!
28,1,6,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1np4/3Q4/8/2PB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',11. Bd3 - preparing a Q and B line-up on the b1-a7 diagonal.  Soon Henry will be in Old Matey's shadow.  That Chessic Grim Reaper's favourites are back ranks corridors and inadequately defended pawns in front of Henry!
29,1,7,1Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/1ppb1ppp/p1np1b2/3Q4/8/2PB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',11. ..... Bf6 - I may well be forced to play g6 to ensure that the Q and B bite on granite.  As this will make g7 weak in front of Henry Fou Lenoir is badly needed to take the g pawn's place.  If Henry is to have a prayer against Dave then he really does need a prelate!
30,1,8,1h4,b'r2q1rk1/1ppb1ppp/p1np1b2/3Q4/7P/2PB1N2/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - h3',12. h4 - pawn roll - is this the beginning of a kingside pawn storm?  I hope not.
31,1,9,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/p1npbbp1/6B1/4Q2P/2PB1N2/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',14. Bg5 - Dave stops Fou Lenoir from occupying g7 with a pin against Glenda.  I do decide to trade bishops.  At least the Witch will not have assistance from the dsb if the bishops are exchanged off.  Still Glenda isn't too far away I can see her trying to get just a little nearer to her other half very soon.
32,1,10,Bf5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/p1np2p1/5bN1/4Q2P/2PB4/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',15. ...... Bf5 - I now decided to force an exchange of lsbs to try and blunt Dave's mating attack still further.
33,1,11,Qd7,b'r4rk1/1ppq1p1p/p1np2p1/6N1/5Q1P/2PP4/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',17. ..... Qd7 - Glenda moves off the back row to connect my rooks.  She also defends my f7 pawn should I try and exchange rooks on the e column to stop the Witch from having any assistance from the white rooks in her quest to nab Henry.
34,1,12,Rae8,b'4rrk1/1ppq1p1p/p1np2p1/6N1/3P1Q1P/2P5/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',18. ..... Rae8 - following through with my plan mentioned in my last note.
35,1,13,1Ne4,b'4rrk1/1ppq1p1p/p1np2p1/8/3PNQ1P/2P5/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',19. Ne4! - Yikes a family fork is threatened on f6 omigod how can I avoid this??!  Aaah yes by playing f5.  Wheeew! This move stops the fork as the f6 square is covered by the rook on f8.
36,1,14,2Ng5,b'4rrk1/1ppq3p/p1np2p1/5pN1/3P1Q1P/2P5/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',20. Ng5 - the final destination for this knight.
37,1,15,Qxe8,b'4q1k1/1pp4p/p1np2p1/5pN1/3P1Q1P/2P5/PP3PP1/6K1 w - -',22. .... Qxe8 - the rooks have been traded as planned.  Now Dave tries to undermine my castled position still further.
38,1,16,Nd8,b'3nq1k1/1pp4p/p2p2p1/5pNP/3P1Q2/2P5/PP3PP1/6K1 w - -',23. ...... Nd8 - to prevent knight ingress via e6 should the queens get traded off.
39,1,17,2Qh4,b'3nq1k1/1pp5/p2p2p1/5pN1/3P3Q/2P5/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',25. Qh4 - threatening Qh7+ - Glenda is alert and moves to e7 to cover h7 and pin that pesky knight on g5 - notice that the Wicked Witch is currently undefended.
40,1,18,2d5,b'3n2k1/1pp1q3/p2p2p1/3P1pN1/7Q/2P5/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',26. d5 - Dave plays this tempting move but with that pawn no longer covering e5 I can now force a queen swap to eliminate forever the threat of Qh7+.  Glenda performs a neat little zig zag on her broomstick before she trades in her life for that of the Witch.
41,1,19,Qh8,b'3n2kq/1pp5/p2p2p1/3P1pN1/5P1Q/2P5/PP4PK/8 w - -',28. ..... Qh8 - the trade is forced because the Witch is pinned to her king!
42,1,20,3Kg3,b'3n3k/1pp5/p2p2p1/3P1pN1/5P2/2P3K1/PP4P1/8 b - -',30. Kg3 - Dave tries to improve the position of his king for the coming endgame.
43,1,21,3Kg7,b'3n4/1pp3k1/p2p2p1/3P1pN1/5P2/2P3K1/PP4P1/8 w - -',30. ..... Kg7 - Henry tries to improve his position and moves towards the central columns.  This will give him some flexibility whichever way Dave chooses his line of attack to defend adequately against it.
44,1,22,Ke7,b'3n4/1pp1k3/p2p2p1/3P1pN1/5P2/2P1K3/PP4P1/8 w - -',"32. ..... Ke7 - here I decided to put the question to Dave in the form of a Draw Offer.  I thought I had done enough to keep him out.  Dave thought so too and accepted my Draw Offer.  After the acceptance of the Draw Offer I did request Computer Analysis.  Gameknot assessed the position as: Score: -0.64 which meant the position was slightly in Dave's favour so the Draw Offer was a good call.  Interestingly enough Gameknot did not flag up either side's moves in yellow - so no blunders mistakes or even innaccuracies - this was certainly very encouraging for me!  Soon it will be my turn to play against the Petrov against Dave and it will be very interesting to see how I get on there.  Anyhow - time to bask in this latest success - cheers and bye for now - Joanne.

345,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Alright i recently played in a different chess site with a friend: Sicilian dragon variation yugoslav attack and i am excited to show you how i proceeded with the yugoslav attack. I am whitemy friend is black. The point of this game is to give you some inspiration to when you face the sicilian dragon variation. We both had 10 mins each in time.
346,14,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',c5 is the sicilian and it can lead to all sorts of positions.
347,14,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',and he played g6. When your opponent plays g6 you can be sure that he will play the sicilian dragon even tho it is more common to play 4. ... Nf6 first and then play g6 after 5. Nc3 g6.
348,14,3,f3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',f3 is just to prevent the knight from coming to g4 and protecting e4.
349,14,4,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',okaythis is how the yugoslav attack looks likeplace your pieces exactly like i have done.
350,14,5,e6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',i dont like that move. i dont think it's good for black he should maybe play the chinese dragon variation by playing Rb8a6b5 or Bd7Rc8Ne5Qa5 etc.
351,14,6,1h4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/2nppnp1/8/2BNP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - h3',now i started the attack with h4. 
352,14,7,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnp1/4n3/2BNP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',i suppose this is a move you can do because this is black wanting to get the light squared bishop.
353,14,8,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnp1/4n3/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',planning the move Nc4
354,14,9,1Bh6,b'2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/4n3/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - -',ok this is another move in the yugoslav attackexchange the dark squared bishop and then open up the h-file somehow and move in with the queen to h6.
355,14,10,1Nc4,b'2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/8/2nNP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',okey he wants to tackle the queen away and stop the yugoslav attack but i dont want that of course so i surrender my light squared bishop.
356,14,11,1Bxg7,b'3q1rk1/pp1b1pBp/3ppnp1/8/2rNP2P/2N2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - -',it's better for white if the black bishop takes his own bishop instead to gain tempo but you can play this move as well.
357,14,12,1g4,b'3q1r2/pp1b1pkp/3ppnp1/8/2rNP1PP/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - g3',playing h5 immediately wouldn't help since he can just take the pawn with the knight so playing this move helps white a lot.
358,14,13,1a6,b'3q1r2/1p1b1pkp/p2ppnp1/8/2rNP1PP/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w - -',a6 can be played earlier in the game but then it would be named dragjorf i think lol. you know instead of e6 he can play a6 and then b5.
359,14,14,1h5,b'3q1r2/1p1b1pkp/p2ppnp1/7P/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - -',okey now i played h5. i think it's better for black to open up the h-file than the g-file by letting me capture his pawn instead.
360,14,15,1hxg6,b'3q1r2/3b1pkp/p2ppnP1/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - -',so now i opened up the h-file
361,14,16,1Qh6+,b'3q1r2/3b2kp/p2ppnpQ/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',since now the rook is supporting my queen i can finally move her to h6 just like in the yugoslav attack.
362,14,17,1Kf7,b'3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Now i had like 4 mins left and i wasn't sure how to play but i think i played the best move here...
363,14,18,2g5,b'3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/1p4P1/2rNP3/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',i think now white is having a winning position
364,14,19,2b4,b'3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/6P1/1prNP3/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',well he had like 6 mins here and he wasn't sure how to play either but exchanging the knights make it more dangerous for black as you will see.
365,14,20,2Qg7+,b'3q1r2/3b1kQp/p2ppPp1/8/2rNP3/2p2P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',penetrating to the 7th rank.
366,14,21,2Rxh7,b'3qkr2/3b2QR/p2ppPp1/8/2rNP3/2p2P2/PPP5/2KR4 b - -',okey black needs to stop white from playing Qxg6 (wins)
367,14,22,2cxb2+,b'3qkr2/3b2QR/p2ppPp1/8/2rNP3/5P2/PpP5/2KR4 w - -',he checks me as a first try.
368,14,23,2Kb1,b'3qkr2/3b2QR/p2ppPp1/8/2rNP3/5P2/PpP5/1K1R4 b - -',errr i dont think black will win either if i take the pawn but  not taking the pawn and using it as a shelter (almost as if white coverts the pawn to his side) is probably the best move to speed things up
369,14,24,2Qxf6,b'4kr2/3b2QR/p2ppqp1/8/2rNP3/5P2/PpP5/1K1R4 w - -',okey he took my pawni guess he wanted to stop me from taking his g6 pawn also. and so i decided to make a queen exchange...
370,14,25,2Qxd7#,b'4kr2/3Q3R/p2ppqp1/8/2rNP3/5P2/PpP5/1K1R4 b - -',...no i am joking of course xD. so this is how the yugoslav attack might look like and i think if black hadn't taken the pawn at f6 i would have mated him anyways.

Many people nearly everyone would resign now (or before) but the game will go on till the end.
The reason: Blacks' player wanted to become a 1800 rating player; he did not want to think he just wanted to play fast vs lower opponents and win quick victories.
The lesson: if a higher player does not respect you use the mistakes because he will make 1... or many.
Why i annotated the game: to show it to any internet player because i am proud to beat that kind of stronger player that do not respect the lower opponent.
The jokes: he asked a draw then put a postponment for many days and we played it 2-3minutes/move then it was 45hours/move.

I hope you do not think that game was boring. Bye all!"

A couple of days ago I finished this game with another buddy of mine Graham who took part in the Annotations Project Part 2.  Graham is a Class C 1400+ player whose play is reminiscent of that of The Dentist.

790,32,3,Kf1,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq -',This is necessary. 4.Ke2 is worse.
791,32,4,Nh6,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq -',A move that I have not seen before. I think the idea was 5...Ng4 but such hopeful plans rarely turn out as you want them to.
792,32,5,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/8/2B1Pp1q/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',A good move developing and knocking the Queen away.

795,32,8,Na5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/7n/n7/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R w kq -',I have two options. Move the bishop foward or back. If I play Bb5 or Bd5 it is met by c6. Bd3 or Be2 aren't bad but I played...

801,32,14,1Kd8,b'r2k1b1r/pp1bq2p/2pp1p1p/7Q/3PP2N/1PN5/1PP3PP/R4K1R w - -',Both our kings have lost the right to castle. I was expecting 14...Qf7 The computer's suggestion but I would happily oblige a trade of Queens.

817,32,30,3Rc6,b'3r4/5k1p/1pRb1p2/p4P1p/3Pp2P/1P4P1/1P2NK2/8 b - -',Now White has won a pawn.

The knight can get out but in a very bad position (knights are very ineffective on the edges of the board).  During the opening (first 10 moves or so) pawns are best moved to get out of the way so that the real pieces can be developed.

My pawn is protected by my knight and queen you are only attacking with your bishop and queen.  This may seem equal but if you take first you need superior numbers to come out equal.

This also put your rook on the half open f-file.  Also it is almost always best to castle.  Much harder to attack a king in a corner.  A king left in the middle is just waiting to die.
