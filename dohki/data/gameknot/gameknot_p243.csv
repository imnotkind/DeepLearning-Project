Bc5 - the Giuoco Piano or Italian Game or Nf6 the Two Knights' Defence are the most common replies. d6 or Be7 are also playable.

Let me quote from Wikipedia ""The Fried Liver Attack also called the Fegatello Attack (named for an Italian idiom meaning ""dead as a piece of liver"") is a chess opening. This colourfully named opening is a variation of the Two Knights Defence in which White sacrifices a knight for a superficially impressive attack on the enemy king. The Fried Liver has been known for many centuries the first known game score being from a game played in Rome in 1610.[1]. The Fried Liver Attack is classified in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) with the code C57.

After usual opening moves of the Two Knights (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6) White goes on the offensive the game continuing 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5. This latter move gives White a strong attack and is often considered to be a mistake. (Black usually plays 5...Na5 instead; other moves are 5...Nd4 and 5...b5.) White can now get a small advantage with 6.d4 (the Lolli Attack).
However The Fried Liver Attack involves a far more speculative knight sacrifice on f7 with the defining moves 6.Nxf7 Kxf7""
The above mentioned Lolli Attack often leads into a delayed version of this gambit - (Quoting from ""Openings for the Club Player by Tim Harding and Leonard Barden"" 6.... Bb4  (taking away the square c3 from the white knight) 7. c3 Be7 8.Nxf7 Kxf7 9. Qf3  Ke6 10. Qe4 Bf8 and quotes the game Barden-Weaver Adams which white won. Compare this with this game.

81,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone welcome to another match between me and Coach Ion where I was the loser.  Unfortunately in this one there is no pretence of equality as there was between me and Master Freddy (easy19).  I did try to conquer my disease passivitis but I had to go the wrong way about it didn't I?  Ion gives me an opportunity to build a strong pawn centre and get some play with a hypermodern opening such as the Robatsch Defense.  This Defense by black is designed to undermine white's strong pawn centre and to place his dsb on g7 raking down to the white a1 rook so the b pawn is pinned to that rook unless black moves a knight to f6.  Anyhow on with the game.
82,4,1,f4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',4. f4 - this transposes into a the pseudo-Austrian attack of the Pirc Defense.
83,4,2,Bb7,b'rn1qk1nr/pbp1ppbp/1p1p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ........ Bb7 - a double fianchetto - this lsb also proves to be very strong and will be a nightmare piece later on!
84,4,3,e5,b'r2qk2r/pb1nppbp/1p1p1np1/1Bp1P3/3P1P2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',9. e5 - I had several options to deal with the attack on my e pawn?  Was this the correct one?  You the jury decide.
85,4,4,1Qe2,b'r2qk2r/pb1nppbp/1p1p2p1/1Bp1P3/3P1Pn1/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',10. Qe2 - clears both paths and gives Henry a choice of where he wishes to move to.  Glenda also defends Fou Lenoir.
86,4,5,1Qxe3,b'r3k2r/1b1qppbp/p2p2p1/2p1P3/5P2/2N1QN1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',14. Qxe3 - after this plethora of exchanges it is 2 knights v 2 bishops.  Ion will now demonstrate that 2 bishops are definately stronger than 2 knights.
87,4,6,1O-O-O,b'r4rk1/1b1qppbp/p2p2p1/2p1P3/5P2/2N1QN1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - -',15. 0-0-0? - here it is Ion stated in the chat when the game had moved on a little further that he thought my later king move to d2 was my downfall but I do not think that I helped myself by moving Henry to an area where black had a perfect column the b column to funnel his heavies down.  Maybe Rd1 followed by kingside castling was better.  The rook part of the move puts pressure on black's d pawn.
88,4,7,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/3qppbp/p1bp2p1/2p1P3/4NP2/4QN1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - -',16. Ne4 - all well intentioned this move threatens to win either the c pawn or the d pawn due to the pin of the d pawn to the Wicked Witch of the West.  Also hoping for Bxe4 getting rid of one of those bishops but hope chess is a bad bad thing!  However that Witch now waves her wand and kaboom she jumps out of the pin and ends up on that bally b file!  Now dxc6 cannot be played due to Qxb7  - notice how the e5 pawn is actually pinned to b2!

92,4,11,Rd8,b'3r2k1/4ppbp/6p1/p3P3/P2N3P/8/3K2b1/1N2R3 w - -',28. ........... Rd8 - Ion still keeps up the pressure.  The game now lasts only 1 more move.
93,4,12,Rd5,b'6k1/4ppbp/6p1/p2rP3/P2N3P/2K5/6b1/1N2R3 w - -',29. ......... Rd5 and white resigns.  I resigned because I could not avoid the loss of a third pawn.  I have two knights against his two bishops.  There is just no juice left in the position so I wave the white flag.  Well played Ion!
94,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  I played a game with a Master which I lost which involved a 2 piece endgame and with me having the remote queenside pawn majority and my opponent a strong central pawn majority.  I would have thought that in my experience with opponents with remote pawn majorities and losing that my queenside pawn majority should have won through.  I did manage to promote my b pawn but alas Glenda did not stay on the field for very long.  After her departure I was just 3 pawns down without any further play so I decided to call it a day then.  Master Freddy responds to e4 with Nf6 (the Alekhine's Defense).  Alexander Alekhine was a very strong grandmaster with a rating of about 3000.  That defense although it does encourage pawns to attack the horse does have a sting in the sense that the pawns can overreach themselves by advancing too far.
95,5,1,Nxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3nN3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nxe5 - two centralised knights of opposite colour - interesting.
96,5,2,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2p3n1/8/3P4/8/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',9. ........ bxc6 - both sides are left with isolanis - me with a IQP and black with his isolated c pawn.  Which is better or worse I wonder?  Anyhow my queenside pieces need to shift themselves and Henry needs to be tucked away.  I start with Henry by playing 10. 0-0.
97,5,3,1Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2pbp1n1/8/3P4/4BN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',13. Nf3 - over the past few moves I have cleared the queenside back ranks and only Glenda sits between the two castles.  My knight moves to f3 to support the IQP.
98,5,4,1Qc2,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/q1pbp1n1/8/3P4/P3BN2/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',16. Qc2 - connects my two rooks and Glenda eyes up the weak c pawn which is protected at the moment but I see no harm in starting to put some pressure on.
99,5,5,Qd5,b'r1r3k1/p4ppp/2pbp1n1/3q4/P2P4/4BN2/1PQ2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',18. ....... Qd5 - black keeps his queen centralised.  However there will soon be a plethora of exchanges.
100,5,6,2Bxc1,b'6k1/p4ppp/3bp1n1/3p4/P2P4/5N2/1P3PPP/2B3K1 b - -',23. Bxc1 - Volia.
101,5,7,Nc6,b'6k1/p4ppp/2nbp3/3p4/P2P4/5N2/1P1B1PPP/6K1 w - -',24. ........ Nc6 - black redeploys his knight to the queenside hitting out at my IQP.  I now move Henry towards the centre in accordance with endgame guidelines.
102,5,8,2Kd3,b'8/p4kpp/2nbpp2/3p4/P2P4/3K1N2/1P1B1PPP/8 b - -',27. Kd3 - a natural move but I think this is a mistake because my position appears to go down south from here.  At least I get rid of my IQP but I allow black to have a strong pawn centre.  I cannot do anything with my queenside pawn majority at present because b4 is twice attacked by black's dsb and that wretched knight.  I have to take because of a threatened pawn fork on e4 and as I said a pawn exchanged is better than a pawn lost.
103,5,9,2Ng5+,b'8/p4kpp/2nb4/3pp1N1/P7/3K4/1P1B1PPP/8 b - -',29. Ng5  - I am wondering whether I should have played Ne1 followed by Nc2 backing up b4 to enable me to shift that queenside pawn majority up the board.  You the jury decide.
104,5,10,d4,b'8/p5p1/2nb2kp/8/P2pp3/6PN/1PKB1P1P/8 w - -',32. ......... d4 - the central pawns look really menacing.
105,5,11,3b4,b'8/p7/3b3p/4nkp1/PP1pp3/6PP/2KB1PN1/8 b - b3',"36. b4 - I now finally push up that pawn majority but I now find I have left it too late.  Master Freddy now moves his knight to d3 and says ""Gotcha"".  Yup he has.  I will now drop my f pawn for starters but I decide to play on a few more moves to see what I can make of that queenside pawn majority."
106,5,12,hxg5,b'8/p7/3b4/5kp1/PP1pp3/6P1/2KB1nN1/8 w - -',38. ....... hxg5 - this exchange of pawns rules out the chance of black getting a passed h pawn but he will now get a passed g pawn.  3 passers against 1 ouch!
107,5,13,4Ba5,b'8/8/1P6/B4kp1/3p2n1/4p1b1/2K3N1/8 b - -',43. Ba5 - a rather unfortunate choice of square as you will see later on.
108,5,14,4b7,b'8/1P6/8/B5p1/3pk1n1/4p1b1/2K3N1/8 b - -',44. b7 - I push my pawn as far as I can for now.
109,5,15,4b8=Q,b'1Q6/8/8/B5p1/4k3/3pn1b1/3Kp1N1/8 b - -',47. b8/Q and resigns.  I decide to resign because I realised just after I crowned my pawn that black did not have to play BxQ allowing NxN leaving me with a piece against his 3 passers.  He could always play Nc4  getting his knight out of the line of fire and then picking Glenda off next move.  I now decide to wave the white flag and concede one rating point pegging back my rating to 1759.  At least I was involved in an endgame with a player rated more than 2000 in fact in this instance a Master where I started with even material.  Pity I could not maintain it.  Cheers.  Joanne.

111,6,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play the French Defence as usual. I only play anything else if I'm bored.
112,6,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Main line French. Occasionally someone will play 2.Nf3 but this is the usual line.
113,6,3,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Exchange Variation of the French Defence. This leads to a symmetrical drawish position and White's only advantage is to have the first move. The Exchange French is often played by weaker players trying to get a draw against a stronger player not the other way round!
114,6,4,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',?! The Svenonius Variation. Not popular in GK's database and statistics give Black an edge. This is a solid move but removes the best developing square for White's queenside knight. If I were going to move that pawn I would play 4.c4 forming a quasi-Queen's Gambit position but obviously no longer a gambit as it is defended by the bishop. At any rate I would probably favour a quiet developing move such as 4.Nf3 or 4.Bd3.
115,6,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The most popular database option.
116,6,6,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Following the database.
117,6,7,Kd2,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1K1PPP/RNBQ3R b kq -',Very interesting and unusual. White opts to move his king and lose castling rights instead of more naturally blocking with Qe2 or Be3 both of which the DB suggests. I suppose that after 7.Qd2 Qxd2 8.Bxd2 White's light-squared bishop is not on such a good square while White's dark-squared bishop is probably not very well placed on e3. At any rate White's king is now blocking any development of White's dark-squared bishop and preventing White's knight from developing onto any square other than a3 so I would definitely go for blocking the check in White's position.
118,6,8,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1K1PPP/RNBQ3R w - -',Part of me - the adventurous attacking part - wanted to play 7...Bf4  forcing the White's king onto c2. But after 7.Kc2 (1) I have no more attack; (2) my dark-squared bishop is under attack by his dark-squared bishop and I have to either waste a move fleeing or exchange a developed for an undeveloped bishop; (3) his king is blocking his own development on d2 so I have no reason to want to force it off. Three good reasons for not playing that move. I decided against it and went for the more flexible and calm 7...O-O.
119,6,9,Qd8,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1K1PPP/RNBQR3 w - -',On second thoughts maybe 8...Qd7 would have been stronger.
120,6,10,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3p4/3P4/1QPB1N2/PP1K1PPP/RNB1R3 w - -',Both sides have poor queenside development but there is a crucial difference: Black can develop his queenside at will although I have not yet done so; White has a cramped queenside whose development is blocked by his king and c-pawn.
121,6,11,1Kc2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3p4/3P4/1QPB1N2/PPK2PPP/RNB1R3 b - -',My opponent makes the logical and correct decision. He moves his king to a safer square and opens up a line for the development of his dark-squared bishop.
122,6,12,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3p4/3P2b1/1QPB1N2/PPK2PPP/RNB1R3 w - -',I am anxious to exchange pieces before my opponent can develop. If I can exchange off all his active pieces his lag in development will be much harder to cope with.
123,6,13,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3pN3/3P2b1/1QPB4/PPK2PPP/RNB1R3 b - -',I wouldn't play this myself. Another move that could have been used for development wasted!
124,6,14,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3pN3/3P2b1/1QPB4/PPK2PPP/RNB1R3 w - -',Pinning and attacking his knight. Exchanging material is one thing; gaining material is much better.
125,6,15,1Nf3,b'r3r1k1/ppp1qppp/2nb1n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/1QPB1N2/PPK2PPP/RN2R3 b - -',No! A pin turned into a discovered attack! Irritating but not really a problem in any way. I just have to move my queen back.
126,6,16,1Ne5,b'r3r1k1/pppq1ppp/2nb1n2/3pN3/3P1Bb1/1QPB4/PPK2PPP/RN2R3 b - -',Attacking my queen again. Maybe I should exchange off the pieces in the centre quth 14...Bxe5 (14...Nxe5 exe5) 15.Bxe5 Nxe5 etc. and make use of his lag in development. But for some reason my heart wasn't in it. 
127,6,17,1Nf3,b'r3r1k1/ppp1qppp/2nb1n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/1QPB1N2/PPK2PPP/RN2R3 b - -',What is irritating is that we both appear to be playing the best moves possible - well maybe my opponent does I'm not sure about myself... - but the position is still a draw.

CHECKMATE

Now this attack was - it is true - speculative. But down a pawn I looked forward to slow death if I played it safe. 

But while I thought I had a mating net I think black can find safety on the a4 and b4 squares shuttling back and forth.  The problem is that white needs to bring the rook into the final mating step and if black plays carefully I don't see how white can weave the mating net. 

Instead it is a draw."

Black could have prolonged it but there was a mating net in any case."
157,9,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I like to vary my openings. Being placed in a group of five so four games with each colour I played 1. d4 twice and 1. e4 twice.
158,9,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
159,9,2,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',"After doing a little cursory research this appealed to me more than the complexities of 4. cxd5. (As of 31/12/08) Wikipedia describes this move as ""a safer continuation"" for ""less adventurous players""."
160,9,3,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Less common -- and perhaps also less adventurous -- than 4... Bg7 5. e3 c5.

162,9,5,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',More standard development. This moves offers Black the chance to gain a tempo with dxc4 although then his pawn on c6 is no longer supporting the centre.
163,9,6,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black instead continues his own development seemingly happy to leave the centre closed.
164,9,7,Nh5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p3n/2PP1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This move attacks the bishop and threatens to inflict doubled pawns.
165,9,8,Be5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pB2n/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A zwischenzug; White accepts doubled pawns but gets Black to block his fianchettoed bishop. This was played in Euwe-Alekhine 1935 World Championship although that was after 4... Nh5.
166,9,9,e5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp4bp/2p2pp1/3pp3/2PP1P2/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - e6',An aggressive strike perhaps premature with Black's development lagging.
167,9,10,1fxe5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp4bp/2p2pp1/3pP3/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White must of course take; otherwise the pawn comes to e4.
168,9,11,1Nxe5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp5p/2p3p1/3pN3/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I jump at the chance to exchange off Black's fianchettoed bishop leaving his king somewhat exposed.
169,9,12,1cxd5,b'rnbq2k1/pp5p/2p3p1/3Pr3/8/2NB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Here I made a strategic decision that determined the course of the rest of the game. Black must recapture with the pawn so he will have an isolated queen's pawn (isolani) but it will also be a passed pawn. While White tries to attack this pawn Black will be trying to promote it. Is its weakness greater than its strength?
170,9,13,1Bc4,b'rnbq2k1/pp5p/6p1/3pr3/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The first offensive is launched. The bishop cannot be taken while the queen is undefended.
171,9,14,1Be6,b'rn1q2k1/pp5p/4b1p1/3pr3/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Naturally.
172,9,15,1Bb3,b'rn1q2k1/pp5p/4b1p1/3pr3/8/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A pre-emptive retreat that prevents the possibility of a double attack on the bishop and another piece later on.
173,9,16,1Re1,b'r2q2k1/pp5p/2n1b1p1/3pr3/8/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Black is forced to exchange rooks due to the skewer on the bishop. This eliminates a defender of the pawn while Rd1 will allow me to keep the same number of attackers.
174,9,17,d4,b'r2q2k1/pp3b1p/2n3p1/8/3p4/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RQ1K1 w - -',Black decides to advance to a better-defended square rather than retreat into the trenches. 20... Ne7 21. Qe5 Nc6 22. Qg3 Ne7 23. Qe3 would win the pawn.
175,9,18,2Bxf7+,b'r2q2k1/pp3B1p/2n3p1/8/3p4/2N5/PP3PPP/3RQ1K1 b - -',To avoid Black doubling my queenside pawns. Black's king comes into the open but we are now in a near-endgame where this is unlikely to be a factor.
176,9,19,2Qe4,b'r2q4/pp3k1p/2n3p1/8/3pQ3/2N5/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Threatening to round up the pawn with Ne2.
177,9,20,2Qe8,b'r3q3/pp3k1p/2n3p1/8/3pQ3/2N5/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Black could also consider the exchange 22... dxc3 23. Rxd8 Rxd8 24. g3 cxb2 25. Qf3  and any king move allows a fork picking up the b2 pawn. White would emerge nominally one point up but with little real chance of winning.
178,9,21,2Nb5,b'r3q3/pp3k1p/2n3p1/1N6/3pQ3/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Continuing with the plan.
179,9,22,2Qxe4,b'r7/pp3k1p/2n3p1/1N6/3pq3/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Black decides to take off one of the attacking pieces.
180,9,23,2Nd6+,b'r7/pp3k1p/2nN2p1/8/3pq3/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Naturally White did not leave the queen unguarded for no reason!
181,9,24,b6,b'r7/p5kp/1pn3p1/8/3pN3/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Denies White's knight the c5 square in view of 25... Rd8 26. Nc5 (threatening b7) b6 27. Ne6 
182,9,25,2f3,b'r7/p5kp/1pn3p1/8/3pN3/5P2/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - -',Offering the king a route to the centre. White will need the cooperation of all three pieces to win the d-pawn.
183,9,26,2Rd8,b'3r4/p5kp/1pn3p1/8/3pN3/5P2/PP4PP/3R2K1 w - -',Naturally the rook goes behind the passed pawn both to defend and to help it advance.
184,9,27,h6,b'3r4/p5k1/1pn3pp/8/3pN3/5P2/PP3KPP/3R4 w - -',This move is unclear to me. Perhaps Black wanted to deny the knight a route to e6 via g5 but there seems no danger in waiting until after it moves to g5 and playing Kf6.
185,9,28,2a3,b'3r4/p5k1/1pn4p/6p1/3pN3/P4P2/1P2K1PP/3R4 b - -',Taking a leaf from Black's book I take a precaution to deny his knight b4 since my king intends attacking the pawn from d3.
186,9,29,2Kg6,b'3r4/p7/1pn3kp/6p1/3pN3/P4P2/1P2K1PP/3R4 w - -',At last Black's king starts to advance towards the action.
187,9,30,3Ng3,b'3r4/p7/1pn3kp/6p1/3p4/P4PN1/1P2K1PP/3R4 b - -',Hindering the advance of Black's king and also eyeing the e2 square.
188,9,31,3Kd3,b'3r4/p7/1pn2k1p/6p1/3p4/P2K1PN1/1P4PP/3R4 b - -',Objective attained.
189,9,32,3Ke5,b'3r4/p7/1pn4p/4k1p1/3p4/P2K1PN1/1P4PP/3R4 w - -',But Black's king has arrived in time to defend.
190,9,33,3Rc1,b'3r4/p7/1pn4p/4k1p1/3p4/P2K1PN1/1P4PP/2R5 b - -',I considered both this move and Re1 . I didn't see much promise in lines such as 32. Re1  Kd5 33. Re4 Ne5  so I decided to knock the knight away first.
191,9,34,3Rc7,b'3r4/p1R5/1p5p/n3k1p1/3p4/P2K1PN1/1P4PP/8 b - -',When in doubt grab material. Taking the rook away from the action is risky but it does put a psychological burden on Black in that he now has to prove himself otherwise he is simply down a pawn.
192,9,35,3Nb3,b'3r4/p1R5/1p5p/4k1p1/3p4/Pn1K1PN1/1P4PP/8 w - -',Of course Black does not allow himself to fall into passivity with 33... Ra8 34. Rh7.
193,9,36,Nc5+,b'3r4/R7/1p5p/2n1k1p1/3p4/P2K1PN1/1P4PP/8 w - -',Now the king must retreat and the pawn gets one square closer to promotion.
194,9,37,Kd4,b'3r4/4R3/1p5p/2n3p1/3k4/P2p1PN1/1P1K2PP/8 w - -',The moment of truth.
195,9,38,3Ne2+,b'3r4/4R3/1p5p/2n3p1/3k4/P2p1P2/1P1KN1PP/8 b - -',"Instead 37. Re3 Nb3  38. Kd1 Rc8 looks very dangerous. I decided to offer Black an ending one ""point"" up in which however I would have a pawn majority on both flanks and a fair chance at drawing just by swapping off the pawns."
196,9,39,3Kc4,b'3r4/4R3/1p5p/2n3p1/2k5/P2p1P2/1P1KN1PP/8 w - -',Black either refused or failed to notice that the knight was en prise perhaps because it just seemed so unnatural that I would do that.
197,9,40,3Nc1,b'3r4/4R3/1p5p/2n3p1/2k5/P2p1P2/1P1K2PP/2N5 b - -',And now the knight reaches its optimum square both defending (b3) and attacking (d3).
198,9,41,3b5,b'3r4/4R3/7p/1pn3p1/2k5/P2p1P2/1P1K2PP/2N5 w - -',This move is unclear. After 38... Nb3  39. Nxb3 Kxd3 40. Re3 Kxb2 41. Rxd3 Rxd3  42. Kxd3 Kxa3 43. Kc2 Ka2 Black wins so I would instead have to take the draw with 40. Rb7 Kc4 41. Rc7  Kb3 etc.
199,9,42,3Rc7,b'3r4/2R5/7p/1pn3p1/2k5/P2p1P2/1P1K2PP/2N5 b - -',! I first looked at 39. b4 N~ 40. Rc7  forcing the king to block the rook's defence of the pawn but since the knight can move to a6 (40. Ra7 Rd6 or 40. Re6 Nb8) this move order is more effective.
200,9,43,3Kd4,b'3r4/2R5/7p/1pn3p1/3k4/P2p1P2/1P1K2PP/2N5 w - -',Naturally Black must evade the pin; otherwise 40. b4 wins the knight.
201,9,44,Ne6,b'3r4/2R5/4n2p/1p4p1/1P1k4/P2p1P2/3K2PP/2N5 w - -',Now the d-pawn is hanging so Black must use this tempo move to stop White taking it.
202,9,45,4g3,b'3r4/4R3/7p/1p4p1/1P1k1n2/P2p1PP1/3K3P/2N5 b - -',Unfortunately I have this resource taking away the only square on which the knight defends the pawn.
203,9,46,4Nd5,b'3r4/4R3/7p/1p1n2p1/1P1k4/P2p1PP1/3K3P/2N5 w - -',The same plan but this move does have one slight drawback. Instead 42... Ng6 allows 43. Re4  Kd5 44. Nxd3 (and not 43. Rg7 Ne5 with good chances).
204,9,47,4Re4#,b'3r4/8/7p/1p1n2p1/1P1kR3/P2p1PP1/3K3P/2N5 b - -',The king is caught in the centre: a picturesque finish.
205,10,0,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',The text move breaks the pin but is considered a less ambitious plan for white. It does offer the advantage of a better pawn structure.
206,10,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',Nimzo-Indian last book move.
207,10,2,e3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',Another alternative is Nf3 but e3 appears okay it safeguards d4 and provides clearance for the f1 bishop while protecting c4.
208,10,3,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',The beginning of a interesting idea to put pressure on g2 by Bc8-b7 which aims to create an advantage based on the lack of development for white and with the idea that white expects to castle short. However white can play Bf1-e2 then Ng1-f3 where after ...Bxf3 then Bxf3 ...Nc6 to protect the rook - blocks in the c pawn which is usually pushed to c5.
209,10,4,f4,b'rnbq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP1P2/2N1P3/PP1B2PP/R2QKBNR b KQ f3',White loses the thread and forsakes development but has little to gain from this move which creates a weakness at e4.

245,10,40,Kh6,b'8/2n3r1/7k/P7/1P4p1/K5R1/8/8 w - -',Black makes a bold decision to chase the rook by using the king. Nice.
246,10,41,Na6,b'8/8/nP6/P7/6rk/1K4p1/8/6R1 w - -',A nice blockading move.
247,10,42,Kh3,b'8/8/nP6/P7/6r1/2K3pk/8/6R1 w - -',The rook will be forced out.
248,10,43,Rf4,b'5R2/8/nP6/P7/5r2/2K2kp1/8/8 w - -',White forfeits on time but the pawn promotion can not be stopped and black would get a queen and win. White does not have time to eliminate the knight and promote pawns. A nice game with interesting play.

256,11,7,dxe5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2pp1p/6p1/2p1p1Nn/2P5/2KPB3/PP2BPPP/R7 w - -',Now black can take the pawn since white's last knight move took the pressure off of e5. I would like to break up the center a little bit see if I can find a way to upgrade my material advantage - black cannot win the game by just staying up by a bishop for rook exchange alone.

261,11,12,e6,b'r1br2k1/pp6/4p1pp/2BBpp2/2P2n2/2KP3P/PP1N1PP1/R7 w - -',A sneaky trick by white blocking with check but it avails him not.

263,11,14,dxc4,b'r1br2k1/pp6/6pp/2B1pp2/2p2P2/2KP3P/PP1N1P2/R7 w - -',double-threatening white's backward and indefensible d3 pawn.
264,11,15,exf4,b'r1br2k1/pp6/6pp/2B2p2/2N2p2/2KP3P/PP3P2/R7 w - -',Now black has what he needs to win. Up by a pawn and the exchange and with a crushing 4-2 pawn adavantage on the King-side. Time to liquidate a little and start looking for that promotion. Black must also keep an eye on white's passed (but isolated) d pawn.
265,11,16,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/p3B3/1p5p/4Npp1/5p2/2KP3P/PP3P2/6R1 w - -',27. Be7? loses more material for white. After black's move if white plays 28. Bd6 Re6 and now both 29. Nc4 pb5 or 29 Bc7 Bb7 followed by 30 Rc8 wins material for black.
266,11,17,hxg5,b'r1b3k1/p7/1p2r3/4Npp1/5p2/2KP3P/PP3P2/6R1 w - -',Not 29. ... Rxe5?? 30 Bxf4  loses black's rook to the discovered check.
267,11,18,Rh6,b'r1b5/p6k/1p5r/4Np1R/5p2/2KP3P/PP3P2/8 w - -',I considered 31. ... Kg7 hoping for 32 Rg5  Kh6! which leaves white with threated rook and knight and no way to save both. But I didn't really think he would fall for it and the move I chose forces him to exchange rooks (otherwise he loses his pawn on h3).
268,11,19,Rxh3,b'r1b5/p6k/1p6/4NpR1/5p2/2KP3r/PP3P2/8 w - -',I didn't expect to get the pawn but I'll take it eliminating one of white's two passed pawns and extending black's material lead.
269,11,20,Kh5,b'r1b2N2/p7/1p4R1/5p1k/5p2/2KP1r2/PP3P2/8 w - -',I'm not sure what white is up to. A rook and a knight cannot force checkmate on an open board. I had expected him to bring in his king by now while my rook and bishop are too far away to do me much good. It's interesting to note that we've played 35 moves and are transitioning into the endgame at this point and black's bishop at c8 has not moved yet - I don't know if that's good or bad since black has built a sizeable material lead by staying so busy pursuing multiple attacks that I  haven't required the help of that bishop yet.
270,11,21,Bb7,b'r4N2/pb6/1p6/5p1k/5p2/2KP1r2/PP3PR1/8 w - -',Now I finally move that bishop threatening white's knight but also threatening 37. ... Rxd3  followed by 38. ... Bxg2.
271,11,22,Bd5,b'r7/p7/1p2N3/3b1p2/5pk1/2KP1r2/PP3P1R/8 w - -',It's a fork. Now black wins another pawn.
272,11,23,Rc8,b'2r5/p1N5/1p6/3b1p2/5pk1/2KP1r2/PP3P1R/8 w - -',I didn't expect that move by white. Nd4 would have been much more annoying and probably would have saved his pawn on a2. This move however allows me to exchange pieces and win the d3 pawn.
273,11,24,Rdxd3,b'8/p7/1p2K3/5p2/5pk1/3r1r2/PP3P1R/8 w - -',And now it's pretty much a lock. White has nothing.
274,11,25,Rh6+,b'8/p5R1/1p3K1r/5p2/5p2/3r1k2/PP3P2/8 w - -',Setting up a couple different checkmates. I expect white to be reluctant to move co F7 and let me exchange rooks and I don't expect e7 because I think he wants my a7 pawn badly enough to not block his line of attack. But he cannot play 46. Kxf5 because of Rd5  . Maybe his best move would be to chase my rook with 46 Kg5 in which case I was seriously considering trading 2 rooks for 1 with 46. ... Rd1 47 Kxh6 Rh1  48. K moves Rb1  49 Kf6 Rxg7 50. Kxg7 Kxf2 and now black promotes his advanced pawn.
275,11,26,Rhd6,b'8/p5R1/1p1r4/4Kp2/5p2/3r1k2/PP3P2/8 w - -',White moved into a forced mate in 2 (really mate in 3 since white can play the useless Rg3  if he wants to stall one move).

288,12,11,2Bc4,b'1r3rk1/p3bppp/Pp3n2/4Q3/2BR4/1N6/1PP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',White now has a stranglehold on the position.

294,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I begin with the king's pawn opening. Usually I find 1. d4 to be more effective since 1. e4 can be more easily defended with c5 or c6 respectively the sicilian and karo-kann defences.
295,13,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The sicilian defence popular for me as black.
296,13,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I move the game into the Alpin variation seemingly just as effective as 2. Nf3 but to me c3 is preferable.
297,13,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',At this point I unintentionally leave the opening book lines (7. Nf3 would have continued along a branch of the Sicilian Defence Alpin Variation) and decide to threaten Black's knight away from d5 hoping to prevent or at least delay a dxe5 also hoping to develop my bishop and push his knight closer to the edge.
298,13,4,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/3P4/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Black moves his knight to safety as I do my bishop. With my bishop on e2 I'm more prepared to face a potential Bg4 from black maintaining my queen's positional integrity after h3 Bxf3 Bxf3.
299,13,5,1Bxd1,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/4P3/8/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBBK2R b KQkq -',After the pawn exchange Black is free to exchange queens. Not a problem with my bishop on e2 since now my position stays fairly solid.
300,13,6,1b3,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/2b1P3/8/1P3N2/P4PPP/RNBB1RK1 b kq -',Right here I play a risky and perhaps unnecessary move. I had hoped to fianchetto my dark square bishop in an attempt to gain better control of the central squares d4 and e5. In addition I had tried to control the squares a4 and c4 from his advancing knight on b6. On the minus side this move endangers my a1 rook to Black's bishop and becomes my Achilles heel as we will soon see...
301,13,7,1Nxe5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n2p3/2b1n3/8/1P3N2/P4PPP/RNBB1RK1 w kq -',"When Black had captured my pawn I had thought ""huh he's endangering his knight. I must take it.""

303,13,9,1Re1,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n2p3/4N3/3b4/1P6/P4PPP/RNBBR1K1 b kq -',...so I just decide to protect my knight.
304,13,10,1Bxa1,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n2p3/4N3/8/1P6/P4PPP/bNBBR1K1 w kq -',And now I'm behind by a rook and a pawn minus a knight. At this point I felt that I was going to lose no matter what but I figured that I'd just keep playing.
305,13,11,1Ba3,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n2p3/4N3/8/BP6/P4PPP/bN1BR1K1 b kq -',I thought that putting my bishop on a3 would be good for preventing my opponent's kingside castle and could lead to an attack on his king.
306,13,12,2Rg3,b'r1b1k2r/1p1n3p/p3ppp1/8/4N3/BP4R1/P4PPP/3B2K1 b kq -',I could've done Nd6+ but I was in no mood to exchange my aggressive knight for my opponent's bishop that had yet to be developed.
307,13,13,2f4,b'r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p3ppp1/8/4NP2/BP4R1/P5PP/3B2K1 b - f3',In doing this I hope to prevent a possible e5 from messing up my plans of attacking the king.
308,13,14,2b5,b'r1b4r/3n1k1p/p3ppp1/1p6/4NP2/BP4R1/P5PP/3B2K1 w - b6',I believe that here was where my opponent made a critical mistake. Now both the a7-g1 and a8-h1 diagonals are left open and I still have my two bishops. As you will see in these next few moves my opponent's rook has no means of escape.
309,13,15,2Bc7,b'2b4r/2Bn1k1p/pr2ppp1/1p6/4NP2/1P3BR1/P5PP/6K1 b - -',At this point my opponent only has a couple of options: After moving his rook to c6 I can then land a check with Nd6+ (or Ng5+). My opponent can then capture the knight on d6 with his rook and my bishop on c7 can recapture. Or my opponent can simply move his king out of the way and I'd capture the rook with my f3 bishop (the less preferrable option).
310,13,16,2Bb7,b'7r/1bBn1k1p/pr2ppp1/1p6/4NP2/1P3BR1/P5PP/6K1 w - -',But instead my opponent tries to develop his bishop on account of the fact that it won't make a difference if he moves his rook since his knight is guarding it.
311,13,17,Bxe4,b'7r/3n1k1p/pB2ppp1/1p6/4bP2/1P3BR1/P5PP/6K1 w - -',Instead of recapturing right away with his knight my opponent initiates a trade off. I can either save my bishop or recapture. I choose the latter.
312,13,18,2Rc3,b'7r/5k1p/pn2ppp1/1p6/4BP2/1PR5/P5PP/6K1 b - -',An now my rook has a lot of potential whereas his knight doesn't. Unless my opponent decides to trade rooks I now have a tactic that may cause me to win one of the a or b pawns.
313,13,19,fxe4,b'7r/7p/pnR1pkp1/1p6/4pP2/1P6/P5PP/6K1 w - -',While creating a passed pawn on e4 my opponent also isolates his e pawns.
314,13,20,Kf5,b'7r/7p/pR2p1p1/1p3k2/4pP2/1P6/P5PP/6K1 w - -',I suppose that instead of protecting his a pawn my opponent decides to keep his king playable bypassing a possible g4 and attacking my f pawn. But really my opponent just puts his own pawns at risk and material eventually evens out.
315,13,21,3Rf6+,b'3r4/7p/5Rp1/1p6/4pk2/1P6/P5PP/6K1 b - -',Worried about a possible Rd1+ Kf2 Rd2+ which loses my a pawn I need to get my rook down to where my king is.
316,13,22,3Re1,b'3r4/7p/6p1/4k3/1p2p3/1P6/P5PP/4R1K1 b - -',I'm just preparing for my king to jump to f2 also preventing my opponent from advancing his passed pawn.
317,13,23,3a4,b'8/7p/6p1/4k3/Pp6/1P2p3/3r2PP/R5K1 b - a3',I had to move my rook over and protect my pawn but the enemy passed pawn just gets closer and closer. I decide that this is the best course of action so that at least my a pawn isn't lost for nothing.
318,13,24,3Kf2,b'8/7p/6p1/4k3/8/RP6/3rpKPP/8 b - -',An obvious choice since Ra1 only leads to a rook trade and promotion with Rd1.
319,13,25,4b4,b'8/7p/6p1/8/1P2k3/R7/3rpKPP/8 b - -',By simply advancing the pawn I prevent the enemy king from accessing d3. This way no matter what I eventually win the passed pawn.
320,13,26,Rxe2+,b'8/7p/6p1/3k4/1P6/8/4rKPP/8 w - -',That was unexpected. I had imagined that he would kill my pawn. I now have a slight advantage as his king would just go for the pawn leaving my king closer to the other pawns.
321,13,27,4h4,b'8/7p/6p1/8/1Pk4P/8/4K1P1/8 b - h3',Now this was truly my worst error (besides 13. Nxe5 obviously). Before this move I actually had a won position (you can plug the position before this into a chess engine to make sure) even though I hadn't realized it. The best move would have simply been to go after the enemy pawns. Doing this I relinquish my pawns' ability to support each other and jump forward two squares. Even if the enemy king went for my pawns I could have simply played h3 or g3 and my opponent would only get away with one pawn leaving my other pawn to move up and join my king after I had killed his two pawns. After this move the position was drawn. Well I guess I learned my lesson.
322,13,28,5hxg6,b'8/6k1/6Pp/6P1/6K1/8/8/8 b - -',By now as you can see it's impossible for either player to win. The game eventually went ... Kxg6 gxh6 Kxh6 draw. This game just goes to show that one wrong move although seemingly harmless affects the whole game. I was actually quite disappointed with the outcome despite my comeback. But overall this game was pretty interesting. I hope you enjoyed looking this over. And please don't hesitate to leave me comments. Until next time this is thechosen0ne.

Developing the knight with an attack against black's queen almost forces the queen back (white gains a tempo) or to exchange queens - either of which favors white.

I need to use my advantage to leverage more of an advantage. But black is bottled up pretty tight defensively so for now I'm just devoloping.
331,14,7,1Be3,b'r2k3r/pppb2pp/2nb1p2/3N3B/3N4/4B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Again I don't expect black to keep trading material while he's down. So I figure I will develop my bishop a little and open up my queen's rook. I wouldn't mind the exchange either if black wants to trade knights.
332,14,8,1Bxd4,b'r2k3r/pppb2pp/3b1p2/3N3B/3B4/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And now I find my attack.
333,14,9,1Nxf6,b'r2k3r/pp1b2pp/2pb1N2/7B/3B4/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The pawn looks defended but it wasn't. Now if 16. ... Pxf6 17 Bxf6 forks the king and the rook. But if black doesn't play that moving his rook (to break the fork) lets white play 18 Nxh7. But moving his king allows white to play 18. Nxe7 Kxe7 19 Bxg7. Maybe black's best answer is to relocate the bishop off of e7 such as with 16. ... Bf5.
334,14,10,1Bxh8,b'r6B/ppkb3p/2pb4/7B/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Rook and two pawns for bishop and knight. Slight advantage for white.
335,14,11,1Rad1,b'7r/ppkb3p/2pb4/7B/8/8/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',We have only played 18 moves so far but already this position feels like an endgame so I decided to treat it like one. The biggest advantage for white is that now I have a clear pawn majority and a path to promotion of my supported passed pawn that is virutually guaranteed to win more material (or promote).
336,14,12,2c3,b'7r/ppk4p/3b4/2p2b1B/5P2/2P5/PP4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Moving the threatened pawn seems preferable to defending it. I don't want my rooks tied to defense.
337,14,13,2g4,b'7r/ppk4p/3b4/2p2b1B/5PP1/2P5/PP1R3P/5RK1 b - g3',Beginning the king-side steamroller.
338,14,14,2h3,b'6r1/ppk4p/3b4/2p2b1B/5PP1/2P4P/PP1R4/5RK1 b - -',My g4 pawn is pinned and cannot take the bishop. Moving the king to break the pin loses the pawn. The only option is defense.
339,14,15,2Bxg6,b'6r1/ppk4p/3b2B1/2p5/5PP1/2P4P/PP1R4/5RK1 b - -',More unexpected exchanges. I am all in favor of clearing away the black pieces now. In fact if I could exchange rooks I would gladly sacrifice Rxd6 to eliminate his last piece leaving me 3 pawns against 1 on the king-side.
340,14,16,2f5,b'8/ppk4p/3b2r1/2p2P2/6P1/2P4P/PP1R4/5RK1 b - -',And now my king-side pawns are all on squares his bishop cannot touch. I had thought this would give me time for rook maneuvers or to bring my king forward to lend his support all without worrying about black's bishop.
341,14,17,2f6,b'8/ppk4p/3b1P2/2p3r1/6P1/2P4P/PP1R4/5RK1 b - -',By not getting his rook in front of the pawn black gives his permission to white. Permission granted I gladly accept.
342,14,18,2h4,b'8/ppk2P2/3b4/2p3r1/6pP/2P5/PP1R4/5RK1 b - -',A sweet move if I do say so myself. If white takes the pawn black recaptures with check and then he can maneuver his rook back to his back rank and defend f8 with both rook and bishop. Not at all what I want. Now black's rook is threatened so Bf8 is out. Rg8 fails miserably. Black has nothing. White must gain a queen unless black leaves his rook to die.
343,14,19,3Qe8+,b'4Q3/pp6/2k5/2p4r/6pP/2P5/PP6/5RK1 b - -',And now black's rook dies. Black had nothing better. All six possible king moves allowed white's queen to fork the black king and rook.
344,14,20,3Qxh5,b'8/pp6/1k6/2p4Q/6pP/2P5/PP6/5RK1 b - -',Black resigned.

346,15,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black has chosen the move that could branch into many main line queen pawn openings such as the Nimzo-Indian Defence Benoni Defence and King's Indian Defence or transposing back to Classical Queen's Gambit Declined.

348,15,3,f5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/2PPn3/2P1P3/P1Q2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq f6',Black has a pawn formation faintly reminiscent of the Dutch Defence.

350,15,5,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3ppn2/5p2/2PP4/2PBP3/P1Q1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',A move like this can only increase White's lead in development. If Black wants to get his bishop out that way he has a whole chain of pawns to move! By contrast he can develop his bishop far more quickly by fianchettoing it or even placing it on a6.

506,25,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Since I always open this way I did not really mind participating in a tournament called 'Queen`s Pawn'. It is not over yet but at least one game was pretty interesting. 
507,25,1,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The opening the King`s Indian Defence usually leads to sharp games. While White plays on the queenside Black tries to attack the king`s flank after playing f5. I used to play this as Black for some time but was not really glad with the outcome. Perhaps I should try it again I am still looking for a good defence against d4...
508,25,2,Ne8,b'rnbqnrk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I am not so sure about this move. It fits to Black`s plan he can play f5 now but I think he should have developed at least one more piece played Nbd7 or 6...a5 7...Na6 planning to go to b4 and slowing down White`s attack.
509,25,3,e5,b'rnbqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/3p2p1/4Pp2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I decided to try to take his last active piece out of play. 
510,25,4,Nc6,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/2np2p1/4Pp2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Of course he can`t just allow me that.
511,25,5,1h4,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1b1/2np2pp/4Pp2/2PP1B1P/2N2N2/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - h3',Apparently he wants to play g5 followed by f4 and perhaps Bg4. For some reason I did not like that.
512,25,6,1a3,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp3b1/2npp1pp/4Pp2/2PP1B1P/P1N2N2/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Already planning a pawn storme on the Queenside.
513,25,7,1dxe5,b'r1bqnrk1/ppp3b1/2n1p1pp/4Pp2/2P2B1P/P1N2N2/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',After 12.Bxe5 I might still have an advantage but I decided to get Black a really bad bishop.
514,25,8,1b4,b'r2qnrk1/pppb2b1/2n1p1pp/4Pp2/1PP2B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',According to my plan. I have come to the conclusion that this move was not the best one. I should have played 13.Qd2 Kg7 14.Rad1 Rf7 which leads to an even bigger advantage considering that I would always have the possibility to play b4. However this move is not really bad.
515,25,9,1a5,b'r2qnrk1/1ppb2b1/2n1p1pp/p3Pp2/1PP2B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - a6',This was a mistake. It weakens b5 which should be pretty useful to me.
516,25,10,1b5,b'r2qnrk1/1ppb2b1/2n1p1pp/pP2Pp2/2P2B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And of course I try to use this.
517,25,11,1Ne7,b'r2qnrk1/1ppbn1b1/4p1pp/pP2Pp2/2P2B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Nb8 or Na7 was better. Now Qd2 was really strong: 15.Qd2 Kh7 16.Rd1 and he can`t protect his bishop without losing another piece.
518,25,12,1c5,b'r2qnrk1/1ppbn1b1/4p1pp/pPP1Pp2/5B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Not the best one but not bad. (Qd2...)
519,25,13,1c6,b'r2qnrk1/1p1bn1b1/2p1p1pp/pPP1Pp2/5B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Of course he can`t allow my pawns just to wait here with an evil grin on their face.
520,25,14,1b6,b'r2qnrk1/1p1bn1b1/1Pp1p1pp/p1P1Pp2/5B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Actually I think this was not the best move. I played b6 because I saw that his pieces don`t really have any good squares any more but it closes the Queenside which means I can`t really attack here anymore. So the game will move to the king`s flank and who plays on the king`s flank in the King`s Indian Defense? Black. I think 16.a4 was better since he can`t take on b5 (16...cxb5 17.axb5 and I can either attack a5 or just hope to create a free pawn. And of course 16.Qd2 was good although after 16...Kh7 Rad1 he could play Nd5.
521,25,15,1Nd5,b'r2qnrk1/1p1b2b1/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/5B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Of course he moves the knight to the only good square.
522,25,16,1Qd4,b'r2qnrk1/1p1b2b1/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/3Q1B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Take a look at the position. I do not have any pawn breaks although his pieces are just terribly bad positioned. So bad in fact that I thought he could not really harm me any more and decided I had time. A terribly bad mistake actually.
523,25,17,1Rf7,b'r2qn1k1/1p1b1rb1/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/3Q1B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R4RK1 w - -',His only possibility he has to play his bishop to e7 and g5-g4. 
524,25,18,1Rfe1,b'r2qn1k1/1p1b1rb1/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/3Q1B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I assumed that after trading the knight I would probably get a free pawn on the e-file. But I think I should have played 18.Nxd5 because my pieces still are better and I would have got either the free pawn or could have tried to create one on the b-file.
525,25,19,1Bc4,b'r2qnbk1/1p1b1r2/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/2BQ1B1P/P1N2N2/5PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',19.Nxd5 was much better. As far as I remember I thought I could perhaps sacrifice a piece on d5 and either play e6 or get at least a second free pawn on b6. But this won`t work and now I will lose a tempo after taking on d5. Therefore Bd3 was probably better too because it uwould have undermined his pawn structure after Nxd5 exd5 e6 and prevents g4. If he plays cxd5 I could still try to push my pawn to b5.
526,25,20,1Rh7,b'r2qnbk1/1p1b3r/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/2BQ1B1P/P1N2N2/5PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Of course he has to move his rook because otherwise I play 20.Nxd5 cxd5 21.Bxd5 exd5 22.e5 and get the piece back. This move protects h6 too so that he can play Be7 finally.
527,25,21,2Rab1,b'r2qnbk1/1p1b3r/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/2BQ1B1P/P1N2N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Most probably I didn`t think long enough at this point just thinking on a perhaps occuring free pawn on b6 (which wouldn`t have mattered due to Rb8) and just losing a tempo in fact. I probably thought: 'He can`t harm me anyway.' Actually he could. Therefore 20.Nxd5 followed by 21.Bd3 was much better.
528,25,22,2Ng7,b'r2q1bk1/1p1b2nr/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/2BQ1B1P/P1N2N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',Defending e6 against a possible e6-push and preventing Nxd5.

530,25,24,2Bd3,b'r2q1bk1/1p1b2nr/1Pp3pp/p1PpPp2/3Q1B1P/P2B1N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Of course I don`t want to lose my bishop but now he has a  fork.
531,25,25,Bxc5,b'r2q2k1/1p1b3r/1Pp3pp/p1bpPp2/5Q1P/P2B1N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',At this point I have to confess I was pretty angry with myself. In the beginning my position was much better and it ended just being a pawn down.
532,25,26,2e6,b'r2q2k1/1p1b3r/1Pp1P1pp/p1bp1p2/5Q1P/P2B1N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Of course the loss of the pawn was just a brilliant sacrifice because now I have got the free pawn on e6 which is only prevented from promoting by... two bishops two rooks and a Queen. Yes really brilliant. But I was a pawn down I had to attack and his bishop is less dangerous on e8 or c8.
533,25,27,2h5,b'r2qb1k1/1p5r/1Pp1P1pp/p1bp1p1P/5Q2/P2B1N2/5PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Finally I got a possibility to break up the position but I would have needed it earlier...

I assume 26...Bxa3 was better although it looks strange to place the bishop on the a-file while I am attacking. But after 26...Bxa3 27.hxg6 Bxg6 28.Bxf5 Bxf5 he is still a pawn up and I don`t think I have much compensation...

First black skewer's the white queen and rook with his 8th move and now white loses the exchange.

Already down by the exchange and two pawns he cannot afford to let black press the attack on his king. 13. c3 or 13. Qb3 might have saved him for now. Even 13. d3 gives the king an escape route. Now after black's 13th move white is in hot water. He must save his queen but the only move that prevents immediate checkmate is 14.

656,33,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A sort of KID set up? So i assume that my opponent is going to castle on king side. I commence my attack without delay.
657,33,2,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The ideas behind my play in this game are very simple. Starting with this move - I simply place the bishop on a diagonal that may be useful in attacking the king later. 
658,33,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',KID setup - ish...i was right!
659,33,4,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Developing. Better than Nge2 because I can now use Ng5 square to attack the king. 
660,33,5,h3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This is not to stop Bg4 that pin is useless. Bg4 h3 Bxf3 Qxf3 etc and white has a more pieces out in the open. The idea behind this move is just pawn expansion on king side
661,33,6,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ -',The previous move allows me to do this move without worrying about Ng4
662,33,7,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',hmm not sure how useful this move is. Black should focus more on developing pieces here. 
663,33,8,Qd2,b'rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',idea is to castle queen side and launch a quick attack on black's king

667,33,12,Ba6,b'rn1qr1k1/4ppbp/bp1p1np1/p1p5/3PP1P1/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R w - -',This move is troublesome because if the black bishop takes my white bishop...my queen will be displaced from line of fire :P  (i.e. the c1 - h6 diagonal). Hence i have to take the bishop first but I still have time to do some damage on the king side. 
668,33,13,1g5,b'rn1qr1k1/4ppbp/bp1p1np1/p1p3P1/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R b - -',simple. displaces the knight and allows h4

673,33,18,1hxg6,b'3qr1k1/3nppbp/r1np2P1/ppp3P1/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R b - -',opens the h file
674,33,19,1Qe2,b'3qr1k1/3np1bp/r1np2p1/ppp3P1/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1QP2/2KR3R b - -',the idea here is to attack the b5 pawn and preventing b4. 
675,33,20,1Qc7,b'4r1k1/2qnp1bp/r1np2p1/ppp3P1/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1QP2/2KR3R w - -',maybe he's planning Qxb5 Rb6 and thus attacking my b2 pawn...
676,33,21,1Qxb5,b'4r1k1/2qnp1bp/r1np2p1/pQp3P1/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2P2/2KR3R b - -',But i go ahead and take it anyways because I notice that after this move I have Qc4+

683,34,0,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Thus begins the return match to the game I have just annotated with an opening I have never seen before. The principal idea is clearly to fianchetto White's light-squared bishop but this is not a common opening.
684,34,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq e6',There is nothing stopping me from putting two pawns in the centre so why shouldn't I? Such an opportunity is extremely rare for Black.
685,34,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White has formed a Barcza formation on the kingside; Black has a classic centre-based position with his pawns and knights controlling the centre.
686,34,3,e4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq e3',Now finally White opens out and takes on a more dynamic position with a strike at the centre.
687,34,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Left to myself I would have played 6...d4 but GameKnot's DB showed that this pawn advance is premature and collapses after 7.c3 so I went for what the database showed was a more popular option i.e. to castle kingside.
688,34,5,Ne1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/4p3/1nP5/3P2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQNRK1 b - -',I can't see why he did this move: it is counter-developing and very passive. Na3 would fulfil the same purpose.
689,34,6,1Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/P2P1NP1/1P3P1P/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',And back again.

691,34,8,Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/4p3/2Pn2b1/P2P1NP1/1P3PKP/RNBQ1R2 w - -',The beauty of this is that while the knight is pinned to the queen the queen is tied to the knight's defence so it cannot move to liberate the knight! A vicious circle culminating in the fact that none of the two pieces can move. A worthy prize in itself but I was after more...I wanted to WIN the knight.
692,34,9,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4p1b1/2Pn2b1/P2P1NPP/1P1N1PK1/R1BQ1R2 b - -',Only one problem obstructs my cunning plan. The attackers unfortunately do not outnumber the defenders.
693,34,10,1Qxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2P3P1/P2P1QP1/1P3PK1/2R2R2 b - -',Fine then. Mass exchanges and the material count is still equal.
694,34,11,gxf6,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p2p2/4p3/1PP3P1/P2P2P1/5PK1/2R2R2 w - -',Excellent! A rooks-and-pawns endgame. I love the endless complexity in their apparent simplicity and the immense capacity for any side to make a tiny positional slip which costs the game.
695,34,12,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pp3p1p/2p2p2/4p3/1PP3P1/P2P2P1/5PK1/2R1R3 w - -',Both rooks to the semi-open central files but I think the d-file offers greater opportunities for Black than the e-file does for White.
696,34,13,a6,b'3rr3/5pkp/ppp2p2/4pP2/PPP3P1/2RP2P1/6K1/4R3 w - -',The queenside pawn formation looks suspiciously like a very well-known endgame pawn promotion puzzle. But since the rooks are on the board the best that I can expect of these pawns is to be exchanged off.
697,34,14,Rd8,b'3r4/5p1p/ppp2p1k/4pP2/PPP1P1PK/2R3P1/8/8 w - -',Off goes one pair of rooks.
698,34,15,3b5,b'3r4/5p1p/ppp2p1k/1P2pP2/P1P1P1PK/2R3P1/8/8 b - -',Initiating the pawn exchanges.
699,34,16,3Rxa5,b'8/5p1p/1r3p1k/R3pP2/4P1PK/6P1/8/8 b - -',BAM! BAM! BAM! and all the queenside pawns have disappeared. Now the battle focuses on the kingside...where the position looks drawn.
700,34,17,Rb1,b'8/5p1p/5p1k/4pP2/R3P1PK/6P1/8/1r6 w - -',Aha! I saw the light! I could threaten checkmate after 37...Rh7  ! Maybe my opponent hasn't noticed! In any case there was only one feasible move that he could defend with...
701,34,18,3g5+,b'8/5p1p/5p1k/4pPP1/R3P2K/6P1/8/1r6 b - -',...and unfortunately he found it.
702,34,19,f6,b'8/R6p/1r3p1k/4pPp1/4P1K1/6P1/8/8 w - -',Closing the kingside pawn formation again. I have gained a slim advantage in the form of a pawn but I very much doubt that I was able to convert it into a win.
703,34,20,4Re2,b'8/7p/5p1k/4pPp1/1r2P1K1/6P1/4R3/8 b - -',A draw was agreed. Should it have been a draw? What do you think? Are there any wins in sight? I very much doubt it :-).

We start with the Reti Opening. Quite a recent one and a flexible opening as it offers opportunities to transpose into King Pawn Queen Pawn or English setups."
705,35,1,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White is going for a Barcza kingside formation.

708,35,4,1e3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p3b/8/1P1PPNPP/PBPN1PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White is slowly solidly gaining more space and advancing his pawns and pieces. The game has so far been very positional; I have seen no tactics coming into it which is unlike Kasparov but I suppose a good policy against a computer.

Deep Blue is playing to the traditional strengths of a computer - tactical attacks -  while White seems to be forced into passivity.
712,35,8,2b4,b'3rr1k1/1p1n1p2/1qp4p/4p1bb/pP2P3/P3NPP1/1BP1R1B1/R1Q4K b - -',Keeping the queenside files blocked.

714,35,10,3Qf1,b'3rr1k1/1p6/2p3Pp/1q2nP2/pP2p3/P1B1NbP1/2P3B1/R4Q1K b - -',Suddenly it is Black who appears to be on the ropes! His kingside has been cracked open like an egg and White's kingside pawns are menacing his position...

716,35,12,4Rxg4,b'3rr3/8/2p3Pk/1p3P2/pP2p1R1/P1B5/2P2K2/8 b - -',Such mass exchanges can only help White who is down by an exchange but has an easily won pawn formation.

737,37,5,Ba6,b'r6r/p2p1kpp/b1pBppq1/8/2P5/3Q4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I had wanted to push the a pawn out first but figured I'd rather have the rook cover my pawn than the bishop.

Trading the queen off (he'd pretty much have to take with the pawn) would buy me some time to try and unlock my e pawn and have my rook get to that file to eventually try and dislodge the bishop.
739,37,7,Rac8,b'2r4r/p2p1kpp/b1pBpp2/8/2P5/3P4/P4PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',The idea was to push the c pawn but this could easily be countered.

748,37,16,h5,b'r3r3/3p1k2/b1pBpp2/p1P3pp/P2P4/6PP/5P2/1RR3K1 w - h6',I had to build a defensive structure against a possibly dangerous advancing pawn wave on the king side. This also buys me more legroom for the king and rook.

Re6 as opposed to Re8 precisely so I can have a more solid structure like this while also allowing for an eventual Bb3 which could potentially force his d rook into a corner like he has my poor a rook. The rook exchange offered is actually to my disadvantage since he has an active rook vs my active bishop.
758,37,26,dxe6,b'r7/2B2k2/2p1p3/p1Pb2pp/P7/6PP/8/3R2K1 w - -',I took the chance to break my d pawn free from getting uselessly tied up and constantly under attack.

And if 22. Ne7  I simply play Kd7 while 22. f3 loses the queen.

It appears as if even if white has a move he can't use it to save the game. 

The only choice seems to be 22. Ke2 since after Qxf2  23. Kd1 QxQ 24.QxQ e6xf5 and despite the quality black pawns should win but the game is still playable. 

But meybe black has an even better choice: after 22. Ke2 Nxf7... what? The threat is to win the white queen with the knight after the discovered check. 
So let's take a look at the possible moves for white.

A) 23. Rh1 doesn't help after Nxh1  and now white have to choose between 
1) 24. Kd1 Qg1  25. Qe1 QxQ 26. KxQ and after RxN black wins or 25. Ke2 and QxRa1 or even 25. ... Qg4  26. Ke6 RxN and white cannot take the Nh1 because of Rf5  Ke2 and Qg2  winning the rook or 
2) 24. Kd6 Qh3  and now white again have to choose between 25. Ne3 Nf2  26. Ke2 Qf3  27. Ke1 QxRa1 winning or 25. Qe3 QxN  26. Kd2 Qf2  27. QxQ and black wins because can save the h1 knight both with RxQ or NxQ (28. Rf1 Rf6!). 

Last chance for white: B) 23. Qb4 threatening the rook... but while the simple RxN balances the material Ne4  or Ng4  require more work (23. ... Ng4  24. Kd3 RxN 25. Rxe6 Rf3  26. Kc4 Ne3  27. RxN (Kc5 Rf5  and mate...).

Actually I have got off to a reasonable start winning 2 games and drawing one.  Those wins pushed my rating above the 1750 mark for the first time in my chess career.  Here is the latter of the two.

If you are a pawn down in an endgame and you VOLUNTARILY exchange down into a pure K & P endgame let me tell you three things it is SUICIDE SUICIDE SUICIDE!

If a1 then Glenda will appear dealing instant death on c1.  If Kc1 then Henry moves to a2 and then the white king has only 1 legal move d2.  He can take the c2 pawn if he wants to but there is no stopping that b pawn!  I wake up the next morning to a white flag from my opponent and a 1760 rating!  Marvelous!
