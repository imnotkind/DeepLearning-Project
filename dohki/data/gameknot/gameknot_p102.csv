1,0,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black signals his willingness to let White trade a perfectly useful Bishop for a Knight for the minor inconvenience of doubled f-pawns.

7,0,7,3Rd2,b'8/p4pk1/7p/4P3/1q6/5NPP/1P1R1PK1/8 b - -',We might have called it a draw here: White's Knight and Rook are ideally placed for defense and his King is well-shielded from checks. Neither player has a realistic chance of winning anymore. Black's only chance of prevailing lies in his a-pawn which is going nowhere as long as White's b-pawn sits safe and smug on b2; White's only chance is in advancing his K-side pawns to supplement a combined R-N-K attack ...which would leave White's King open to harrassing checks and potential missteps that might lose material.

45,2,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Snyder Sicilian variation (played by none other than Master Short). I had meant to play an Alapin with 2.c3 but didn't realise I had played b3 instead. I'm quite fond of the queenside fianchetto in general so it was just a little mind-slip and fortunately I'm quite familiar with the position. With best play White doesn't really obtain an advantage in the opening but what matters is who is more familiar with the resulting positions and plans. With this position White looks to get the dark squared bishop working through the center to the kingside from the start.
46,2,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Generally it's agreed that 2...Nc6 with plans of e5/d6 are the most testing. The resulting positions can be quite subtle although White does have ways of keeping it more open. Typically though you'll find Sicilian players will tend to their favoured structures though which are perfectly fine. With 2.e6 Black looks to ensure c4 is a poor square for the light-squared bishop and develop flexibly.
47,2,2,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Naturally the bishop is going here - everyone knows it so no sense playing something else which may limit responsive options.
48,2,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops the knight but as in many similar structures is able to be chased away with e5 which is then supported by Nf3. 
49,2,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2pnP3/8/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',White's d-pawn is going to be a liability during the game unless it can be exchanged through the typical opening of the Sicilian structures. Nc6 makes this difficult as the e-pawn will be free in the event of a d4 cxd4 Nxd4 exchange.
50,2,5,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1BpnP3/8/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',So in this position we play the thematic Bb5 looking to exchange off Black's good knight and impact the pawn structure for a target to play against later. If a6 is played it's a wasted move since White fully intends on the exchange.
51,2,6,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/2pnP3/8/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I believe Black recaptures with the right pawn to try to generate some counterplay against the weak d-pawn. Opening the b-file wouldn't have given him as much to play against. White's position may appear to be quiet but development is slightly better and the pieces are more coordinated. The knight on b1 can sometimes be troublesome to develop well in these positions - however it has a good perch with Nc3 to Ne4 where it is nicely centralised and the advanced e-pawn prevents f4 from chasing it away. The d4 push to open the position may now also be a possibility for White.
52,2,7,f5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p1p1p3/2pnPp2/4N3/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6',I think Black may have been better with b5 to get the queenside pawn mass working for him (which isn't nearly as weak as many would believe). I suppose that Black was looking to chase away the knight...
53,2,8,1exf6e.p.,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p1p1pP2/2pn4/4N3/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But forgot about e.p. Now White has a weak e-pawn to try to work against as well.
54,2,9,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p1p1pn2/2p5/4N3/1P3N2/PBPPQPPP/R4RK1 b - -',A stronger move than just simply exchanging knights as it allows for development through recapture while connecting the rooks. The plan will be to exchange some pieces off the board to try and take advantage of the pawn weaknesses.
55,2,10,1Qd5,b'r1b2rk1/1p2b1pp/p1p1pn2/2pq4/4N3/1P3N2/PBPPQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black looks to double attack the knight defended once but the threat is eliminated through simply exchanging. The Queen on d5 is also susceptible to being kicked with c4 which is a thematic square for the pawn in these positions to further secure the center.
56,2,11,1c4,b'r1b2rk1/1p4pp/p1p1pb2/2pq4/2P5/1P3N2/PB1PQPPP/R4RK1 b - c3',The Queen is displaced with a free exchange on the bishop.
57,2,12,1Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/1p4pp/p1p1pq2/2p1N3/2P5/1P6/P2PQPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Centralising the knight to strike into enemy territory allowing for some play with the f-pawn to further control the center. (perhaps the a2-c4 wing with a f4-h2 wing supporting the knight and rooks in the center?). The knight controls the king's potential flight square of f7.
58,2,13,1Qg5,b'r1b2rk1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2p1N1q1/2P5/1P6/P2PQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',This allows for a potential exchange of Queen's which will fix the problems with the d-pawn through the exchange as well as for a more effective f-pawn push.
59,2,14,Rf5,b'r1b3k1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2p1Nrq1/2P5/1P2Q3/P2P1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black declines the exchange which allows for White's Queen to strike at the hanging c5-pawn if the 5th rank can be cleared up through the intended f4 push.
60,2,15,Qd8,b'r1bq2k1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2p1Nr2/2P2P2/1P2Q3/P2P2PP/R4RK1 w - -',? Qe7 to defend the pawn was better. The weak d-pawn is in effect poisoned due to back-rank threats (remember the knight controls f7)
61,2,16,Qxd2,b'r1b3k1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2Q1Nr2/2P2P2/1P6/P2q2PP/R4RK1 w - -',?? The Queen is now able to be pinned by the rook to the threat of Rd8.
62,2,17,2Rad1,b'r1b3k1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2Q1Nr2/2P2P2/1P6/P2q2PP/3R1RK1 b - -',If the Rook gets to d8 then the game is over and Black has no way to defend against the mate. The only piece available to defend is the f5-rook which can be exchanged off with Rxf8 and the queen supporting the convergence square of f8.
63,2,18,2b6,b'r1b3k1/6pp/ppp1p3/2Q1Nr2/2P2P2/1P6/P2q2PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black hopes to simply exchange off Queen's but there is no need as the b-pawn hangs and the Queen can threaten from b6 as well.
64,2,19,2Rd8+,b'r1bR2k1/6pp/pQp1p3/4Nr2/2P2P2/1Pq5/P5PP/5RK1 b - -',Now mate is forced

67,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',If dxc5 then Black can regain the pawn with Qa5+. Black can also play e6 gambiting the pawn.
68,3,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',a weak move
69,3,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The position is equal already. Now Black will play for the advantage.
70,3,4,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Another weak move that locks in the darksquared bishop.

72,3,6,f4,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p1q2/3P1P2/4P3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq f3',White gains control over e5 but g3 and e3 are weakened.

77,3,11,1Rf2,b'4k2r/1p1n1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/4PN2/PPr2RPP/R1B3K1 b k -',White tries to swap rooks now but Black doesn't want to exchange in this position else he loses control of the c-file.
78,3,12,Rc7,b'4k2r/1prn1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/P4RPP/R1B3K1 w k -',Perhaps black should have played Rc7 immediately instead of wasting a tempo. However the text creates darksquare weaknesses.
79,3,13,1Rff1,b'5rk1/1prn1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/PB4PP/R4RK1 b - -',Black should have played Rc2 here.
80,3,14,1Rfc8,b'2r3k1/1prn1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/PB4PP/R4RK1 w - -',Instead Black doubles up on the c-file.
81,3,15,2Rac1,b'2r3k1/1prn1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/PB4PP/2R2RK1 b - -',White offers to exchange rooks again.
82,3,16,2Rxc2,b'2r3k1/1p1n1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/PBR3PP/5RK1 b - -',White had no other moves. If the c1 Rook moves away then ... Rxb2 capturing the bishop and if Ba1?? then ... Rxc1 winning a whole rook.

84,3,18,2Kf1,b'2r3k1/1p1n1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN2/PB3RPP/5K2 b - -',White probably plans to move his king to d1 or d3 and then try swapping rooks again.
85,3,19,2h3,b'2r3k1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/3P1P2/1P2PN1P/PB3RP1/5K2 b - -',But there's nothing defending the e4 square.
86,3,20,2Ne4,b'2r3k1/1p3ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3PnP2/1P2PN1P/PB3RP1/5K2 w - -',Now Black loses huge material.

The text move is to impede the K-side pawnstorm that you'd have to be nuts not to see coming.

An additional observation here: White would LOVE to push a pawn to f5 in this position. But obviously the evil consequence of ...Nde5 makes that move impractical at the moment.

I still find it hard to master the finesses of this opening to know exactly which placement of the pieces is best in which positions. Another example is the question whether to start an attack with e5 or f5 although I'm finding f5 is usually the better choice.

Probably 13.Bg5 was better because my move seems to lose a tempo compared to the game. That was also a move that I had considered.

170,7,17,Qg6,b'r6r/1p1kn1bp/p1bpppq1/2p2p2/4P2Q/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/4RR1K w - -',A strange queen manoeuvre. Maybe he's trying to attack on the kingside but it just seems too slow and ...Bf8 and ...Rg8 will never follow. It allows me to re-organise my pieces and get some counterplay for the pawn.

The computer suggests the very interesting 19.b4!? cxb4 20.Bxb4 Nc8 when his knight has to stay passive to defend d6. Strangely enough I had also seen that it was possible but didn't pay too much attention to it because it was not in the spirit of the normal GPA attack which I'm used to. It's good that I at least thought about it but I should also learn to really think 'out of the box' and consider those unusual moves.
176,7,23,1Qf7,b'4r2r/1p1knqbp/p1bppp2/2p5/4N2N/3P4/PPPB1QPP/4RR1K w - -',?! This is probably an inaccuracy. Black can't hold his extra pawn anyway so he should have played 19...Qg4 20.h3 (20.Nxf6?? Bxf6 21.Qxf6 Ref8 and the knight on h4 is lost) 20...Qh5 and then 21.Nxf6+ Bxf6 22.Qxf6 or 19...Qh5 immediately. Now White will take advantage of the pin.
177,7,24,2Ng5,b'4r2r/1p1knqbp/p1bppp2/2p3N1/7N/3P4/PPPB1QPP/4RR1K b - -',! The Black player said that he had missed this move.

179,7,26,2Nxg6,b'4r1qr/1p1k2bp/p1bpNpN1/2p5/8/3P4/PPPB1QPP/4RR1K b - -',I thought for a long time here but couldn't work out the variations completely so I decided on the safer move. However it's not the best. 22.Nxg7 is better when after 22...Rxe1 23.Bxe1 Nxh4 24.Qxh4 Qxg7 I have a good position in the late middlegame thanks to my active pieces and Black's pawn weaknesses. However I couldn't figure out what would happen after 22.Nxg7 Nxh4 with a triple threat on g2 but then 23.Rxe8 Qxg7 24.Re4! is strong. I guess this is such a position in which it would be easy to work out the best move in correspondence chess but for which you don't have enough time over the board.

183,7,30,2Qd5,b'4r3/1p1k4/p1bp1Qp1/2pq4/8/2BP4/PPP3PP/5R1K w - -',? But Black panics and does not take his chance in time trouble (9 minutes + 30 seconds per move increment for 15 moves). With 26...Re2! 27.Rf2 Rxf2 28.Qxf2 Qxa2 he wins back his pawn and may even have a better position. Now White wins a second pawn and deals with the simple mating threat at the same time.

With two pawns more I should be able to win this ending (even with opposite-coloured bishops) at least as long as I keep the rooks on the board. I think I didn't have a choice anyway keeping the queens on would have given Black too much counterplay.
188,7,35,3Rf2,b'8/1p1k4/p1bpr3/2p5/8/2BP4/PPP2RPP/7K b - -',And after I defended the seventh rank Black surprisingly chose to resign rather than keep on struggling to hold this ending. I guess he was just tired of the tournament and had had enough and moreover he was still short of time. But it would still have been quite a hard job to get one of my two connected passed pawns to the other side. With my last two wins I managed to end the tournament on +1 (+3 -2 =4) and a 1514 performance and I was very happy with that. However I think there's still a lot to learn and I hope I have made the first step with these 9 annotations. I'm also happy that I've finished the job because it took me a lot of time but on the other hand I think it was well worth it. Thank you all for reading through my annotations any tips or suggestions would be welcome.

It is time for game number 3 which also ended in a loss.  This time at least my opponent had to sacrifice material to get at Henry.  I took a free pawn because I could not see that there was any immediate mate threat.  However taking the pawn led to an exchange sacrifice which I had to accept or be a piece for two pawns light.  After having this material deficit in my game against Janet and losing to her in the manner I did I decided to accept the sacrifice and make Dongoodman prove its soundness.  Unfortunately he did exactly that and Henry ended up ..... well ..... erm ..... you will just have to follow this link and find out! http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18572637&fb=1&rnd=0.2366468098222443."

At least f7 would have been guarded and RxP would really have won a pawn and not allowed the disaster that was to follow.  Mind you Dongoodman may well have backed up his pawn if I had moved the other rook to d8.

Henry has been totally denuded and needs a whole new wardrobe never mind those medieval stockings.  But Glenda will not have time to cast the first stich or fill in the order form for a new wardrobe from MFI.  The Wicked Witch of the West and the WR on f1 will keep Henry so confined that he will not even be able to attempt a Deadly Dash despite having a few large juicy crevettes for lunch which has done wonders for his fitness!  At 64 he should be putting his feet up in his castle and not be dashing around that battlefield.  That is 18 year old Glenda's job!

Remove both rooks from the board and the game will most certainly be drawn as white will have nothing better than Ye Olde Perpetualle.  Remove both sets of major pieces and it is game set and match to Yours Truly!  But alas both sets of major pieces are on the board and the Witch only needs one piece to assist her and what with Henry's enforced moonshine the assistance of a rook is deadly.
210,8,21,3Qg3+,b'r5k1/8/p7/4p3/1q1b4/6Q1/1P4PP/5R1K b - -',36. Qg3+ - the killer.  Notice that the Wicked Witch of the West covers the square e1 preventing Glenda coming down on that square and delivering a back row mate.  Take away that pawn and white's next move would have allowed mate in two again on the back row and white must either continue checking Henry ad infinitum or allow me to make a move which will cover Henry.  Alas that pawn is there and mate is now unavoidable.  I did not attempt to prolong the agony and preferred to allow instant death on my terms by threatening mate to prove the point that although I have been beaten fairly and squarely here I wanted to show everyone that I have not lost sight of the fact that the object of the game is to checkmate my opponent's king even if that opponent is 1000 rating points above me!  Anyhow I have my work cut out if I am gonna compete with consistency against this level of play.  Anyhow well played Dongoodman - Joanne

I have just been informed by Gameknot that this is my 6th anniversary of joining gameknot - doesn't time fly!  To date this is my first completed match in my third mini-tournament against the Titans.  As my rating has climbed I am progressively taking on opponents with ratings which lean towards GM Level.  Here I am playing against IM Klauno (Klaus).  In this game I chose a rare line of the French Defense which would lead to open play.  I thought that it would help me overcome passivitis which has been my millstone around my neck particularly against the higher rated players for many years.  Things seemed OK and then I developed the wrong knight.  This seemingly natural move led to Henry being trapped in the centre where he perished.  So how did this happen?  Well here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board?bd=18563548&fb=1&rnd=0.9507084005361646."

225,10,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2BpN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',6. Bc4 - a gambit of a pawn to increase his lead in development.

Klaus' reply hits at the f7 pawn.  Glenda decided to put the question to the WK but this exacerbated the problem because Fou Lenoir is boxed in.

I recall a comment Coach Ion made about The Dentist's position in my last game against me.  Ion quoted this ""White's game is now finely balanced: weak on the king side and equally weak on the queenside.  That white's centre is looking pretty wobbly completes the picture.  Yup that describes my (black's position to a tee!)."

I would have also been a whole rook down because Be7 was the only way to avoid immediate mate.  Rather than resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material I simply allowed sudden death on the next turn.  So that is Game 1 lost and although Game 2 against The Brigadier was a marginal improvement I still managed to get Fou Leblanc trapped and found another way for Henry to cop Old Matey.  However despite this loss and the other two losses I am about to annotate I am keeping my chin up - cheers and bye for now - Joanne

With research into Blitzkov as my challenge as me being White I felt it was best to do the Queen's Game (that I learned from Boris Spassky back in the much earlier days against Bobby Fischer) for maneuverability and immediate Classical play (I could have used e4 open but after reviewing the history of William Campbell I felt a Queen's Game would ""stretch"" his ability to respond) and so CLASSICAL I PLAY.

483,20,3,Be6,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p1b3/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',To me this is a waste of time.  I understand that she wanted to develop but she cannot do this Queenside without bringing her Queen out too early.  However I do not care because I am going to continue by castling Kingside.
484,20,4,Bd6,b'r2qk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pbb3/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',She takes advantage by kicking my Knight.  Of course this is not going to achieve because I will move to a safe square.

486,20,6,Bc4,b'r2qk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/2b1Pb2/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Because she Kicks my Rook I am just going to protect it.  Therefore I feel that she is still wasting time.  Instead black already should have played ...Nf3 so that she could castle.

A second look proves that this pawn was not hanging due to my c3 Knight so this was a waste of time.  At this point however I am starting to get distracted by Hurricane Sandy as it is already beginning to cause damage in the Caribbean and expected to make a sharp turn into the Northeast.  However this is just the beginning of things to come and the distractions are only going to get worse with no way out of this one as Hurricane Sandy bears closer to the Northeast and produces more damage.   
492,20,12,1Bd6,b'r2qk2r/2p2ppp/p1pbbn2/1p6/4P3/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',I don't know why she moved there.

494,20,14,1Bb4,b'r2qk2r/2p2ppp/p1p1bn2/1p2P3/1b6/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Because she retreats her bishop I am going to take her Knight without hesitating.  Therefore I will trade her Knight for my e5 pawn.
495,20,15,1Ne4,b'r3k2r/2p2ppp/p1p1bq2/1p6/1b2N3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',?? Now this is where I really start to go wrong.  I decide to kick her Queen but I overlooked an important detail.  What was it?  In this position I left my DSB hanging and she is now going to win it with the same piece that is attacked (her Queen).  Why did I miss so much?  At this point Hurricane Sandy has devastated the Carribean Island and is now working on the Bahaman Islands.  There have already been fatalities in Haiti as well as other areas.  If you think this is bad it's not the other half.  After the Bahama's the Hurricane is directly going to the Northeast and this storm is already several hundred miles wide.  
496,20,16,1Neg5,b'r3k2r/2p2ppp/p1p1b3/1p4N1/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Now I decide to fork her LSB and f7 pawn.  As cedeburca once mentioned I am only interested in Knight forks even though there is a lot more to chess then just that.  Note: I am trying my best for someone who is not at his best.  Of course this is not going to stop her from castling Kingside eventhough she should have done it earlier.
497,20,17,1Nxe6,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/p1p1N3/1p6/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',This fork however happens to work out because I am going to win an extra pawn after this exchange.
498,20,18,Rae8,b'4rrk1/2p3pp/p1p1R3/1p6/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',? Now she decides to finish her development and connect her Rooks.  However this is not a good move.  Instead 18...Rc8 was best because I am now going to win a free pawn.  Having said that the distractions caused by Sandy are not nearly as bad as that of Irene.  Why?  With Tropical Storm Irene I would not have seen these types of opportunities.  Instead I would have blundered and lost material by doing something like forking her DSB and Queen with 18...c3. 
499,20,19,Rec8,b'2r2rk1/2p3pp/p1R5/1p6/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',? Once again I do not what she is thinking in this position but this looses another pawn for black.
500,20,20,c6,b'2r2rk1/6pp/R1p5/1p6/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',I don't know why she played this.
501,20,21,2Qb1,b'2r2rk1/6pp/R1p5/1p6/1b6/1P1P1N2/PqP2PPP/RQ4K1 b - -',This just wastes time and development.  In this position my only goal is to knock the Queens off the board but she is not going to accept this exchange because she is behind.  Instead she is going to retreat and protect the Queen and this is the right choice because of what I mentioned in my last sentence.  Therefore 21.Qe2 was best as it is the final step to finishing development and connecting my rooks.  At this point however Hurricane Sandy just devastated the Bahamas.  It has already destroyed some of the islands and has caused more then 40 fatalities and hundreds of injuries.  Furthermore this storm is still headed on the same path toward the Northeast.  If that is not bad enough this storm is already 900 miles long the largest atlantic hurricane in recorded history.  In addition the pressure is very low which makes Sandy more dangerous.  While some of this information might seem irrelevant it has everything to do with my performance in this game.
502,20,22,2c4,b'2r2rk1/6pp/R1p2q2/1p6/1bP5/1P1P1N2/P4PPP/RQ4K1 b - c3',?? My goal is to exchange her pawns but she is behind.  Therefore she is not going to just accept this exchange.  Instead she is going to respond with an important move.  Consequently this is a serious blunder as it is going to loose my rook.  Of course I am still thinking about and am overwhelmed by this Hurricane.  If that is not bad enough I am not the only one who is overwhelmed by the storm.  I work at a retail store and we are running out of flashlights and D batteries.  Afterall all of my customers are buying supplies because we know that it is only a matter of time before this storm produces a lot of damage so we are prepared.  
503,20,23,2Bc3,b'2r2rk1/6pp/R1p2q2/1p6/2P5/1PbP1N2/P4PPP/RQ4K1 w - -', 
504,20,24,2b6,b'2r2rk1/6pp/RPp2q2/8/8/1P1P1N2/P4PPP/bQ4K1 b - -',In this position I know that I cannot take back due to her Queen.  Therefore my goal is a promotion of some sort.  Either a Queen or an underpromotion.  What would the underpromotion be?  A rook to replace the rook that I had lost.  Of course I am not surprised with the fact that my opponent will not allow this.  In chess just like regular life you always have to prepare for the unexpected and you cannot rely on him or her to make a mistake.
505,20,25,2Rcb8,b'1r3rk1/6pp/RPp2q2/8/8/1P1P1N2/P4PPP/bQ4K1 w - -',Therefore she decides to threaten my Rook but I do not care because I am not going to move my Rook.
506,20,26,2d4,b'1r3rk1/6pp/RPp2q2/8/3P4/1P3N2/P4PPP/bQ4K1 b - -',Instead I am just going to play mind games with her and I am not going for any tricks or cheapos.  Therefore why am I playing these games?  To alleviate my fears associated with Hurricane Sandy.  Of course she is not going to accept this game because I am going to loose that pawn.  On the other hand the main part of my goal worked because I am not quite as nervous about this storm?  Why?  Now I am going to use some of those mind games to prepare for the worst instead of panicking.  I am also going to associate it for preparations thinking about what I have to do before I loose power.
507,20,27,2Bxd4,b'1r3rk1/6pp/RPp2q2/8/3b4/1P3N2/P4PPP/1Q4K1 w - -',After she takes I am just going to take back.  However this is not going to win back material as we will see shortly.
508,20,28,2Kf1,b'1r3rk1/6pp/RPp5/8/3q4/1P6/P4PPP/1Q3K2 b - -',?? In this position I am worried that she will mate unless I move my King.  However this is the loosing blunder.  Instead I should have moved my Queen to the second rank as that would have saved the game.  Now it is mate 27...Qxf2#.  Of course I am not thinking because Sandy is very close to the Northeast.  In fact landfall is expected in less then a week.
509,20,29,2Qxf2#,b'1r3rk1/6pp/RPp5/8/8/1P6/P4qPP/1Q3K2 w - -',Sandy made landfall four days after this game and became a superstorm.  I lost power and phone service for 8-9 days and cable for 2 weeks.  If that was not bad enough a tree fell at the bottom of my street so I was semi stranded for 1-2 days because no cars could get in or out for that amount of time.  In addition this storm also destroyed my neighbors car and caused a fire at the bottom of my street.  Despite all of that there were no injuries or fatalities in my family.  In addition my house was not destroyed.  That was lucky because there were at least 180 fatalities and $53 billion in damage due to Sandy.  It was the second most destructive hurricane on record.  Moreover I played better chess prior to this storm then that of Tropical Storm Irene and Irene wasn't nearly as bad as Sandy.  With Irene we also lost power but it only lasted for 3 days.  Then things went back to normal.  With Sandy I got a little nervous and distracted.  Therefore I lost a few games and my rating plummited by about 50 points.  Despite all of that however I was able to win between 3-5 games in a row.  With Irene however I got much more nervous and it caused to play horrible chess.  In fact I skipped all of the basics with Irene.  For examplethere where a couple of games where I brought me Queen out by move 2 and lost in four moves.  When you count that it was even worse then my mistep against blitzkov.  As a result my rating plummited to 851.  That was my lowest rating ever.  With this storm however I lost most of my games due to some bad choices like this game.  And there were a couple of games where I violated some General Opening Principles but I certainly did not skip all of the basics like that of Irene.  That is because I was less nervous with Superstorm Sandy then Tropical Storm Irene.  If you know that a bad storm is coming you want to prepare as much as you can.  On the other hand you do not want to get nervous as that can only make things worse.  The same thing happens in chess.  If you are playing chess and have this situation you want to prepare for the worst.  It is however not a good idea to fret over it in a game.  Otherwise you will not play as well.  That's the moral of this story.     
510,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was an interesting game with an interesting ending.  Started it off with the King's pawn.

512,21,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I decide to harass his knight.  I figure he wasn't expecting this so it would throw him off his game.
513,21,3,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',He proceeds to ignore my bishop and attack the pawn.
514,21,4,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2B2n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I go for some early trading.  He can't ignore this move seeing as I just protected my pawn.
515,21,5,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',He takes my bishop while keeping his pawn structure intact.
516,21,6,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2p2n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I naturally harass his other knight. This is possibly the most aggressive I've ever played in the first few moves.
517,21,7,Ng4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2p5/4P3/6n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',He saves his knight and attacks my pawn at the same time. Solid move.
518,21,8,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2p5/4P3/3P2n1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq d3',I go to protect my pawn.  I putting my central pawns out there which is why I didn't play Nf3.
519,21,9,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1p3/4P3/3P2n1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This move was a mistake.  While it does open up the diagonals for his queen and bishop he unprotects his knight which is his only developed piece at this point.
520,21,10,Qxg4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2p1p3/4P3/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',I take the knight.  There's no way I'm passing up this chance to take a solid material advantage this early in the game even if it does leave my queen in pretty open space.
521,21,11,f5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2p1p3/4Pp2/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq f6',He harasses my queen likely hoping to force my queen back.

523,21,13,Qxf6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp3pp/2p1pq2/8/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',He takes my unprotected pawn and gets his queen involved in a solid position.
524,21,14,Bg5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp3pp/2p1pq2/6B1/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',Harassing his queen.  Notice a pattern emerging here?
525,21,15,Qf7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2qpp/2p1p3/6B1/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Saves his queen but hinders his movement for the next few moves.

527,21,17,e5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2qpp/2p5/4p1B1/3P2Q1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',This was a very good move.  He attacks my pawn and queen simultaneously and opens up the diagonals for his queen and white bishop.  If I hadn't noticed the attack on my queen I would've been doomed.
528,21,18,1Nxe5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2qpp/2p5/4N1B1/3P2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',I did notice the bishop but I thought that he would go to protect his queen before attacking mine.  I figured that I could put my knight into a nice attacking position and try to pin him on his back few ranks but it didn't quite work like that.  In retrospect I probably should have played Qe4.
529,21,19,1Bxg4,b'r3kb1r/ppp2qpp/2p5/4N1B1/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',He takes my queen.  When I came back to this game 3 days after I had made the previous move I had to stop and remember what I was thinking because the last move seemed incredibly stupid.  This move also takes away any real opportunity for a queen side castle.
530,21,20,1Nxf7,b'r3kb1r/ppp2Npp/2p5/6B1/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',I take his queen.  All I could do in that situation if I wanted to stay in the game.

534,21,24,1Re1,b'r4b1r/ppp2kpp/2p5/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1bPPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',I protect my rook and attack his bishop which sets up an interesting battle for the e file.
535,21,25,1Re8,b'4rb1r/ppp2kpp/2p5/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1bPPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',He protects his bishop and gets his rook involved.
536,21,26,1Nc3,b'4rb1r/ppp2kpp/2p5/6B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1bPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I get my knight involved attack his bishop and protect my rook.  I thought this was a really good move at the time but he proved me wrong.
537,21,27,1Bb4,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/2p5/6B1/1b1P4/2N5/PPP1bPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',This was a very good move.  He's attacking my knight but if I move it he takes my rook.  So I had to figure something out.
538,21,28,1Be3,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/2p5/8/1b1P4/2N1B3/PPP1bPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',That's something.  I protect my d file pawn and block his rook opening up his white bishop to attack.
539,21,29,1Bxc3,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/2p5/8/3P4/2b1B3/PPP1bPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Now we trade knight for bishop.
540,21,30,1bxc3,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/2p5/8/3P4/2P1B3/P1P1bPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Finishing the trade.
541,21,31,1Ba6,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/8/3P4/2P1B3/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I'm not sure what he was going for there. I realize that he saved his bishop but he also locked it to one diagonal for at least the next few moves.
542,21,32,1h4,b'4r2r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/8/3P3P/2P1B3/P1P2PP1/R3R1K1 b - h3',Here I wanted to prevent something that had burned me a couple of times in the past.  I'd leave me king on g1 and my pawns on f2 g2 and h2 then I would get careless and mated by a rook on the 1st rank.
543,21,33,1Re4,b'7r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/8/3Pr2P/2P1B3/P1P2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',He goes to attack my pawn and likely double up his rooks.  I never gave him the chance.
544,21,34,1Bg5,b'7r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/6B1/3Pr2P/2P5/P1P2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I protect my pawn and open us up for a rook trade.
545,21,35,1Rxe1+,b'7r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/6B1/3P3P/2P5/P1P2PP1/R3r1K1 w - -',He accepts and I start to get an idea.
546,21,36,1Rxe1,b'7r/ppp2kpp/b1p5/6B1/3P3P/2P5/P1P2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',I finish the trade and realize that I can attack e7 which would put him in check and restrict his king to a few spaces in the corner.  As long as he doesn't play Re8 it will be wide open.
547,21,37,1Bc4,b'7r/ppp2kpp/2p5/6B1/2bP3P/2P5/P1P2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',He moves his bishop to where he should have moved it 3 moves ago.  No effect on my plan.
548,21,38,2Re7+,b'7r/ppp1Rkpp/2p5/6B1/2bP3P/2P5/P1P2PP1/6K1 b - -',There's the check.  I wasn't sure at this point how it would lead to a mate but I just went for it anyway.
549,21,39,2Kg6,b'7r/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6B1/2bP3P/2P5/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - -',He takes what looks like an open path but is actually pretty restrictive.  Now I start to formulate a plan for mate but it still seems like a long shot.
550,21,40,2f4,b'7r/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6B1/2bP1P1P/2P5/P1P3P1/6K1 b - f3',Starting the plan.  I figured that if I got my f g and h pawns up to the 4th rank I could force a mate with either f5 or h5.  His bishop won't interfere because it would either take too long or he would lose it.  Same deal with his rook.
551,21,41,2Bxa2,b'7r/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6B1/3P1P1P/2P5/b1P3P1/6K1 w - -',I think that he was hoping to eventually promote but I never gave him the opportunity.
552,21,42,2g4,b'7r/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6B1/3P1PPP/2P5/b1P5/6K1 b - g3',I get my third pawn up to the 4th file.  Now almost every move will result in a mate but he still has one out...
553,21,43,2Rf8,b'5r2/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6B1/3P1PPP/2P5/b1P5/6K1 w - -',... which he doesn't take.  He realized that I could mate with my f-pawn but couldn't also stop the h-pawn.  If he had played h6 he could have slipped his king back into the corner and I would've been totally lost.
554,21,44,2h5#,b'5r2/ppp1R1pp/2p3k1/6BP/3P1PP1/2P5/b1P5/6K1 b - -',Fortunately he didn't and I was able to put the finishing touch on my plan.
555,22,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The game opens with a King's Gambit.
556,22,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black declines the gambit and offers a counter gambit.
557,22,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White accepts the gambit.
558,22,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/4pP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Here White should play d3 but plays a weird move instead.
559,22,4,Qxd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3q4/4pP2/P6P/1PPP2P1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Black is better in this position. White will have to fight for equality.
560,22,5,1Qxe2,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/8/2pq4/1P2pP2/P1P4P/1B1PQ1P1/R4RK1 b - -',White completes his development first.
561,22,6,1Be5,b'r1b1r1k1/p4ppp/1p1q4/2p1B3/1PP1pP2/P6P/3PQ1P1/R4RK1 b - -',Now White is better.
562,22,7,f5,b'r1b1r1k1/pq4pp/1p6/1Pp1Bp2/2P1pP2/P6P/3PQ1P1/R3R1K1 w - f6',Black weakens his kingside.

566,22,11,Kc8,b'2k5/p2qrrp1/1p2b1Qp/1Pp1Bp2/2P1pP2/P5RP/2RP1KP1/8 w - -',Black runs to the Queenside not realizing that he was actually safer on the Kingside.
567,22,12,3d3,b'8/pk1qrrp1/1p2b1Qp/1Pp1Bp2/2P1pP2/P2P2RP/2R1K1P1/8 b - -',Now Black's king will die.

569,22,14,3Qxd5+,b'2q5/pk3rp1/1p5p/1PpQBp2/2P2P2/P6P/2R1K1P1/8 b - -',Black resigns. Checkmate is inevitable.
570,23,0,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White has opened with the English; Black plays a modern Indian-style response. White will now seek to occupy the center with pawns while Black develops around them and prepares for a central pawn break.
571,23,1,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',With the center happily occupied White continues natural development and prepares for castling. Meanwhile Black is ready to make a play for the center himself with ...e5.
572,23,2,Qd7,b'rnb2rk1/pppq1pbp/3p2p1/4p1B1/2PPP1n1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',This is where we leave the GK database or just about. There's one game with this line which continues 9.h3 Nf6 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qc2 although the GK engine prefers 9.d5 Na6 10.O-O Qe8 though I think that's a bit overly passive.
573,23,3,1Qc2,b'rnb2rk1/pppq1pbp/3p1np1/4p1B1/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PPQ1BPP1/R3K2R b KQ -',10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd7 is more accurate. The text allows 10...exd4 11.Nxd4 Re8 where I think Black has a very slight advantage.
574,23,4,1O-O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1pbp/3p1np1/4n1B1/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PPQ1BPP1/2KR3R b - -',White castles to the dangerous side putting his king in the sights of the Black Bg7. For now though there's no real danger and the benefits of the White Rook on the d-file could be significant.
575,23,5,1Qc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/2qp1np1/4n1B1/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PPQ1BPP1/2KR3R w - -',The GK engine prefers Black to focus on the e-file with 12...Nxf3 13.Bxf3 Qe6 but I think this is okay. Black pressures c4 instead and considers a direct queenside assault to take advantage of the White King's position.
576,23,6,1Kb1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/2qp1np1/4n1B1/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PPQ1BPP1/1K1R3R b - -',The GK engine considers this a mistake but I don't really see it. Apparently 13...Nxf3 14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Nd5 Bd8 16.Bxf3 is strong for Black but I was expecting 13...Nxc4 14.Nd4 Qc5 15.Bf4 with an attempt to trap the BQ somewhere on the horizon (as it happens the GameKnot engine assumes this line as well but considers it slightly advantageous for Black).
577,23,7,1f3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/2q1n3/3NPB2/2N2P1P/PPQ1B1P1/1K1R3R b - -',Stepping out of the way of the Queen while reinforcing e4 with the added bonus of opening up f2 as a station for the Bishop.
578,23,8,1Nh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/2q1n2n/3NPB2/2N2P1P/PPQ1B1P1/1K1R3R w - -',Pushing the Bishop back but it was headed back anyway with no prospects on f4. Probably Black should have preferring finishing his development with ...Bd7 and an eventual ...Rae8.
579,23,9,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/2q1n2n/3NP3/2N1BP1P/PPQ1B1P1/1K1R3R b - -',The BQ's avenues of escape are actually very limited despite not being in direct danger yet--thanks to White's active Knights and well-placed Bishops. The Queen can get out though with 17...Nc4! freeing e5 for the Queen.
580,23,10,1Qb4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/4n2n/1q1NP3/2N1BP1P/PPQ1B1P1/1K1R3R w - -',? Black's first mistake though I can't blame him at all. The lines are really difficult to see here; I won't try to write them all out but Black's Queen is in fact trapped now. Correct was 17...Nc4 as I mentioned above. All the next moves are terrifically complex each move wholly different from the last. I strongly suggest you look carefully at each of the next several positions focusing on White's threats to trap the Black Queen--there are rather a lot of false trails and traps; the positions are really interesting.
581,23,11,1a3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/4n2n/1q1NP3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K1R3R b - -',? Not great but still enough to win. The Queen can escape now at the cost of the Knight: 18...Qc5 19.b4 Nc4 (threatening ...Nxa3+ getting the Queen back) 20.Qa2 Nxa3+ 21.Qxa3 Qe5.
582,23,12,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/1q1p2p1/4n2n/3NP3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K1R3R w - -',? As I mentioned 18...Qc5 was the only way to stay in it. Now the Queen falls again!
583,23,13,1Nf5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/1q1p2p1/4nN1n/4P3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K1R3R b - -',? But White misses the correct move again! Amidst the sea of possibilities there was 19.Na4! which wins the Queen outright. Now Black has a chance to escape.
584,23,14,1c5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/1q1p2p1/2p1nN1n/4P3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K1R3R w - c6',Of course not 19...Qc6?? 20.Ne7+ winning the Queen.
585,23,15,2Rxd6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/1q1R2p1/2p1nN1n/4P3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K5R b - -',White picks up the pawn he sacrificed all those moves ago with interest. The GK computer gives White an advantage of nearly a full minor piece here.
586,23,16,2Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2pbp/3R2p1/2p1nN1n/4P3/P1N1BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K5R w - -',The only good move. Now after 21.Nd5 Qb8 the Queen is safe though after 22.Nxg7 Nxg7 23.Qxc5 White is still looking invincible.
587,23,17,Qa5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/3R2p1/q1pNnN1n/4P3/P3BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K5R w - -',?? The final mistake. Refusing to put his Queen in quarantine on b8 Black misses the trap and this time White follows through correctly.
588,23,18,2Nfe7+,b'r1b2rk1/pp2Npbp/3R2p1/q1pNn2n/4P3/P3BP1P/1PQ1B1P1/1K5R b - -',No point in losing the Knight (though GK prefers 22.Nxg7 and I tend to agree since now White will have a concrete material advantage and reducing towards the endgame will favor him.
589,23,19,2Bd2,b'r1b2r1k/pp2Npbp/3R2p1/q1pNn2n/4P3/P4P1P/1PQBB1P1/1K5R b - -',1-0. With nowhere else for his Queen to run Black resigns in the face of overwhelming material loss (23...Qd8 24.Rxd8 Rxd8 25.Qxc5 is easily enough to prove decisive). Many thanks to hinschi for a fantastic game! I hope some of you enjoyed reading it; especially the last six moves or so. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!

Things seemed ok until the middlegame when Fou Leblanc got caught in a Noah's Ark type of trap but this time it was on the kingside.

I have two options at this position. Either to move dxc e.p. or allow my opponent to close the position. 

Here I can only guess the objective of my opponent. If I allow him to close the position I would not have any significant attack on queen side because b5 will be followed by b7 and a4 by a5 thus closing the position further. Having a good king side attack to follow black should be in a better position leaving the white with no counter chances and left to defend through out the game.

If I take the pawn with dxc e.p. I guess the black was expecting to be able to push his d-pawn forward and forcing a move e4xd5 and thus clearing the diagonal for king bishop on g7. This will lead of strong attack on whites queen side.

If I can find the correct move and proceed with my queen side attack I can even prevent black from carrying out king side attack.

Qb6+ and thus did not think of losing tempo by moving my king of safer position (Kh1). 14 ... Qb6+ can be followed by 15. Kh1 and then 16. Na4 thus pushing the black queen back and gaining in further tempo. The other move that I was contemplating here was to play Nf2 thus closing the attack on my king and supporting the e4 pawn. But I did not feel that I needed to lose tempo by playing this move. So I felt that b4 was best method to continue my attack of queen side and keep up the advantage in tempo. (If black had played Ne7xc6 I would have moved Nf2 thus clearing way for my white squared bishop from being exchanged after black's move Nd4. Though the black knight would be then be posted on strong d4 square it will not be effectively controlling any squares on white 2nd row because it will be extremely difficult for him to post any of his pieces on c2 or e2 squares.)

My objective in the present position was to take advantage of the fact that I am left with a semi open b file which I can use to push my pawn into blacks territory.

One way of doing that is by protecting pawn on e4 thus preventing black's push of e5 to e4. The move Nf2 gives an extra protection of e4 pawn and clears way for white squared bishop for protecting the c pawn. It should be noted that the knight on f2 also protects the g4 square. Thus if black tries to counter attack by pushing his g and h pawns his attack can be stalled by white with series of moves fxg4 and then Nf2xg4 protected by his white squared bishop.

Another line of thought that occured to me in this position was that the black king was relatively open with black's white square bishop being only piece defending it.
