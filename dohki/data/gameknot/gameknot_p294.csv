8,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am going to attempt to annotate my own game here to see why I lost.  This is my first annotation.
9,1,1,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Up to this point the moves had already been made for the mini-tournament.  Queen's Gambit Accepted.  This is my first game using this opening.
10,1,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I decided to establish a presence in the center.
11,1,3,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq b6',He is protecting his c-pawn and limiting my white bishop.

14,1,6,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/p1pbpppp/8/1p6/P1pPP3/2N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This seems to be a poor move.  I thought to attack his b-pawn and protect the center.
15,1,7,b4,b'rn1qkbnr/p1pbpppp/8/8/PppPP3/2N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Knight forced to move.

25,1,17,1Be5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4pp1/7p/b3Bn2/P1B3b1/2p2N2/2N2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I think Rxe8  was probably a better move followed by Be5.

38,2,8,Qh5,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5q2/4N2Q/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Looks can be decieving. Queen now protects Knight attacks the f7 pawn and now the king has elbow room to move. Plus more pressure on the f pawn.
39,2,9,Qxf2+,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N2Q/2B1n3/8/PPPP1qPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Check. Nice effort.

Its a better x-ray square as the f1 to a6 diagonal is open and better than the d1 to a4 diagonal. Better real estate. So white has wasted tempo or time getting to this square.

There is one big flaw here which will be exploited for the rest of the game: Black's Bishop on c8 is not yet developed which keeps the Rook on a8 from entering the game.

As a result this is going to wind up hurting me a lot more than it hurts him -- it's long been said that a flank attack is best met with a counterattack in the center but I need to be playing some defense here...

513,19,43,2Re8,b'4r3/p6k/3b2qp/2p2r2/8/2P1B1p1/PP2Q2P/R5RK w - -',Another nasty pin.  But possibly the winning move was Re5 since after 29. Qf3 (the only way to defend g2 and e3 while stepping out of the pin) Rxe3 wins.
514,19,44,2Qd3,b'4r3/p6k/3b2qp/2p2r2/8/2PQB1p1/PP5P/R5RK b - -',This is a good move since there's no more mate threat on g2 and this is an effective pin of the Rf5 to the queen and king.
515,19,45,2Qh5,b'4r3/p6k/3b3p/2p2r1q/8/2PQB1p1/PP5P/R5RK w - -',Threatens mate on h2 but this is easily defended by Rg2.  Black may win a pawn again but the pin on the Rf5 is more important than he thinks.
516,19,46,Rd8,b'3r4/p6k/3b3p/2p2r1q/8/2PQB1p1/PP4RP/R6K w - -',?  After all of black's play this move costs him everything.  Black thinks he's going to get a great discovered attack on the queen after Bc7 or Be7 but in reality he's just stepped INTO a brutal pin.  And this is because...

518,19,48,3Qf3,b'3r4/p6k/3b3p/2B2r2/8/2PQ1qp1/PP4RP/R6K w - -',?  Perhaps overlooking that after exchanges of the queens...
519,19,49,3Bxd6,b'3r4/p6k/3B3p/8/8/2P2rp1/PP4RP/R6K b - -',...white can exchange off the two minors...

522,19,52,3Rag1,b'8/p6k/3r3p/8/8/2P3R1/PP3r1P/6RK b - -',But this is easily parried and is unproductive for white.

525,19,55,3Rb1,b'8/p6k/8/7p/8/2P5/PP1r3P/1R5K b - -',? Why would I want to hold on to a second pawn?  If I played Rc1 here and just started pushing black could've played Rxb1 Rxa1 Rb1 and pushed the a-pawn all he wanted -- I would've gotten there first.
526,19,56,3h4,b'8/p6k/8/8/7p/2P5/PP1r3P/1R5K w - -',Still not too late for me to play Rc1...

528,19,58,4Rc2,b'8/p6k/8/8/P6p/2P5/1Pr4P/1R5K w - -',Well black knows what to do.  The best place to put a rook is behind a passed pawn no?

537,19,67,4Kf3,b'8/1R6/8/p7/P7/2P2k1p/1Pr4P/6K1 w - -',Rc1  was better as it gives black good drawing chances as it's risky for white to try to avoid the perpetual check.
538,19,68,4Rf7+,b'8/5R2/8/p7/P7/2P2k1p/1Pr4P/6K1 b - -',!  Finally doing what I should've done a long time ago; putting the rook back on the back rank where it can participate in defense as well as assist the c-pawn.
539,19,69,Rxb2,b'8/8/8/p7/P5k1/2P4p/1r5P/5RK1 w - -',???  This loses as now white can put his rook behind the c-pawn and march (like he should have 10 moves before).  But if black had wasted a move (like Kh4 or Kh5 or something) he would have had more chances with his advanced position and active rook.
540,19,70,4Rc1,b'8/8/8/p7/P5k1/2P4p/1r5P/2R3K1 b - -',The game is over now.

851,31,25,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/2pnbppp/p7/1p1p1bN1/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black sees that the enemy knight on g5 poses no danger and could easily be repelled by playing h6. Black sees the chance to get a rook to an open file where a hopeful discovered attack on the white queen can be executed.
852,31,26,1Rfe1,b'r2qr1k1/2pnbppp/p7/1p1p1bN1/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',! Strong move. White reinforces the weak e file. I hope you saw 14...BxN 15. QxR  QxQ 16. RxQ  RxR 17. NxB before you played 14. Rfe1.
853,31,27,1h6,b'r2qr1k1/2pnbpp1/p6p/1p1p1bN1/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black seizes the chance to force the Ng5 to retreat to h3 where it becomes a tasty target.
854,31,28,1Nxf7,b'r2qr1k1/2pnbNp1/p6p/1p1p1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Unsound because f7 cannot be safely attacked once the sac is accepted. 
855,31,29,1Kxf7,b'r2qr3/2pnbkp1/p6p/1p1p1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black snags the piece and now eyes the f file as the quickest avenue of attack for his rooks.
856,31,30,1Ne5+,b'r2qr3/2pnbkp1/p6p/1p1pNb2/3P4/2P5/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',! Very strong. Black has to capture or face the ugly 17. Nc6.
857,31,31,1Nxe5,b'r2qr3/2p1bkp1/p6p/1p1pnb2/3P4/2P5/PP1BQPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black accepts the challenge.
858,31,32,1Qh5+,b'r2qr3/2p1bkp1/p6p/1p1pnb1Q/3P4/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',? Why turn down the free material?  17. QxN  with an additional attack on the Bf5 was much much stronger. Also 17. Qh5  is nothing more than a nuisance.................
859,31,33,1Bg6,b'r2qr3/2p1bkp1/p5bp/1p1pn2Q/3P4/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',............as it is easily blocked with tempo. It is worth noting that this tempo prevents the immediate f4! which would be strong.
860,31,34,1Qxe5,b'r2qr3/2p1bkp1/p5bp/1p1pQ3/3P4/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White now picks up the knight. The problem with his delayed capture of this knight is.....................
861,31,35,1Bf6,b'r2qr3/2p2kp1/p4bbp/1p1pQ3/3P4/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',! Black still gets the discovered attack on the enemy queen (now two times!) and the exchange theme mentioned on move 14 is still alive. If it is carried out black will have a nice advantage in the endgame.
862,31,36,1Qf4,b'r2qr3/2p2kp1/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P1Q2/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',! Strong. White sets a very pretty pin and any exchange on the e file will result in him owning it.
863,31,37,1Rxe1+,b'r2q4/2p2kp1/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P1Q2/2P5/PP1B1PPP/R3r1K1 w - -',While not strictly forced black decides to go ahead and push his material advantage towards a fast endgame.
864,31,38,2Rxe1,b'r2q4/2p2kp1/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P1Q2/2P5/PP1B1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Of course.
865,31,39,2Kg8,b'r2q2k1/2p3p1/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P1Q2/2P5/PP1B1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',! Black not only breaks the pin on his king he also manuevers towards a nice little shelter behind his g and h pawns.
866,31,40,2Qg4,b'r2q2k1/2p3p1/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2Q1/2P5/PP1B1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',White attacks the most obvious target on the board - the unprotected Bg6.
867,31,41,2Kh7,b'r2q4/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2Q1/2P5/PP1B1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',! The black king finds the perfect home. It is now 1) the protector of his light squared bishop 2) in no danger from any immediate or even short term threat and most importantly 3) residing on the opposite colored square than the enemy bishop. Black intends to offer up a queen exchange as soon as possible to exploit this weakness.
868,31,42,2h3,b'r2q4/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2Q1/2P4P/PP1B1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',? No idea what this move is all about. It threatens nothing and defends nothing. White has now returned some time to black.
869,31,43,2Qc8,b'r1q5/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2Q1/2P4P/PP1B1PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Here is what black was hoping for. He wants to exchange queens immediately anywhere then play Re8 to either exchange the rooks as well or to claim dominance on the e file.
870,31,44,2Qe2,b'r1q5/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P4/2P4P/PP1BQPP1/4R1K1 b - -',?! White understands the old rule about avoiding exchanges when down in material and wisely retreats.  He just retreated to the wrong square though. 23. Qd1 was the play.
871,31,45,2Qe8,b'r3q3/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P4/2P4P/PP1BQPP1/4R1K1 w - -',Black attempts once again to eliminate the queens.
872,31,46,2g4,b'r3q3/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1BQP2/4R1K1 b - g3',Definitely aggressive. Getting the f pawn to f5 would most definetly validate it.
873,31,47,2Qxe2,b'r7/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1BqP2/4R1K1 w - -',Black finally gets to dictate the terms for a bit and presses on with the plan.
874,31,48,2Rxe2,b'r7/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1BRP2/6K1 b - -',Obviously forced.
875,31,49,2Re8,b'4r3/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1BRP2/6K1 w - -',Black now aims to exchange rooks on e8.
876,31,50,2Rxe8,b'4R3/2p3pk/p4bbp/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1B1P2/6K1 b - -',Yet again this move was practically forced as 26. Re1 still leads to the rooks being exchanged.
877,31,51,2Bxe8,b'4b3/2p3pk/p4b1p/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1B1P2/6K1 w - -',Just as planned.
878,31,52,2f4,b'4b3/2p3pk/p4b1p/1p1p4/3P1PP1/2P4P/PP1B4/6K1 b - f3',! Strong. White can now totally clamp down on the light squares around the enemy king if he can play f5.
879,31,53,2g5,b'4b3/2p4k/p4b1p/1p1p2p1/3P1PP1/2P4P/PP1B4/6K1 w - g6',Black sees the weakness of the white squares and goes ahead and locks down the dark squares for himself. Having the extra bishop should easily nullify the pawn disadvantage he has on the kingside. 
880,31,54,2fxg5,b'4b3/2p4k/p4b1p/1p1p2P1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1B4/6K1 b - -',? 28. f5 was better  as this move both encourages material exchange (bad for white) as well as liberates black's dark squared bishop. Think about it....if 28. f5 black's dark squared bishop is hemmed in.
881,31,55,2Bxg5,b'4b3/2p4k/p6p/1p1p2b1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP1B4/6K1 w - -',Black presses ahead yet again to get material off of the board. If this offer is accepted black will aim to blockade the enemy g and h with his bishop while the king goes pawn hunting on the queenside.
882,31,56,2Bxg5,b'4b3/2p4k/p6p/1p1p2B1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP6/6K1 b - -',As the wheels had already been set in motion white tries to capitalize on his kingside pawn advantage. He will need to rush his king straight ahead for escort duty. His game depends on getting one of those pawns promoted.
883,31,57,2hxg5,b'4b3/2p4k/p7/1p1p2p1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP6/6K1 w - -',Of course.
884,31,58,3Kg2,b'4b3/2p4k/p7/1p1p2p1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP4K1/8 b - -',White (and black too for that matter) needs  to notice the e and f files. Due to the pawn structure neither side can advance throught this area.
885,31,59,3Kg6,b'4b3/2p5/p5k1/1p1p2p1/3P2P1/2P4P/PP4K1/8 w - -',Black protects his isolated pawn.
886,31,60,3Kg3,b'4b3/2p5/p5k1/1p1p2p1/3P2P1/2P3KP/PP6/8 b - -',White prepares to play h4.
887,31,61,3Kf6,b'4b3/2p5/p4k2/1p1p2p1/3P2P1/2P3KP/PP6/8 w - -',Black knows he can block the enemy pawns from advancing with his bishop if need be and makes a waiting move. The king may be needed to deflect his counterpart after 32. h4 gxh4  33. Kxh.
888,31,62,3h4,b'4b3/2p5/p4k2/1p1p2p1/3P2PP/2P3K1/PP6/8 b - -',As he is already committed white will atempt to press his g pawn.
889,31,63,3gxh4+,b'4b3/2p5/p4k2/1p1p4/3P2Pp/2P3K1/PP6/8 w - -',Forced as black CANNOT allow a passed pawn under any circumstance.
890,31,64,3Kxh4,b'4b3/2p5/p4k2/1p1p4/3P2PK/2P5/PP6/8 b - -',White will now attempt to escort the g pawn to promotion.
891,31,65,3Ke6,b'4b3/2p5/p3k3/1p1p4/3P2PK/2P5/PP6/8 w - -',This move serves as more of a decoy than anything else. Black understands that the white g pawn must be either eliminated or sufficiently blockaded  before he can start pursuing enemy pawns.
892,31,66,3Kg5,b'4b3/2p5/p3k3/1p1p2K1/3P2P1/2P5/PP6/8 b - -',Logical as it restricts the black king from f6.
893,31,67,3Bf7,b'8/2p2b2/p3k3/1p1p2K1/3P2P1/2P5/PP6/8 w - -',Yet another waiting move. Eventually white will run out of moves and be forced to start retreating.
894,31,68,3Kh6,b'8/2p2b2/p3k2K/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P5/PP6/8 b - -',White makes one last valiant effort to support the g pawn's advance. It is worth noting that this attempt is poorly timed however as black controls the candidate queening square.
895,31,69,3Kf6,b'8/2p2b2/p4k1K/1p1p4/3P2P1/2P5/PP6/8 w - -',Black can now safely withstand a check to start dictating terms to the white king.
896,31,70,3g5+,b'8/2p2b2/p4k1K/1p1p2P1/3P4/2P5/PP6/8 b - -',White's last desperate hope........
897,31,71,3Kf5,b'8/2p2b2/p6K/1p1p1kP1/3P4/2P5/PP6/8 w - -',The problem of the g pawn is now solved. Black can now freely start eliminating white pawns. White decides to resign at this point. Good game prosperov2 :) I hope this will help you! - Thomas
898,32,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',King's gambit which I was unhappy to see with the black pieces.  As many of you know playing defense is usually much more difficult than attacking...
899,32,1,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I decline the gambit.  White doesn't dare play fxe5 now as Qh4  wins for black.
900,32,2,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1PPb1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',All standard developing moves for both sides so far -- this is a standard KGD position.  My move here as black is aimed at getting that knight off the board as it controls too much of the center here.
901,32,3,h3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1PPb1/2NP1N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',More usual is Na4 eliminating the dangerous dark-square bishop but h3 is quite playable.
902,32,4,Qxf3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2NP1Q1P/PPP3P1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',A much better recapture than gxf3 positionally but black has a nice move here...
903,32,5,Nd4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2BnPP2/2NP1Q1P/PPP3P1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This is standard so I can't give myself an exclam but it hits the queen and threatens a nasty fork on c2; hence white is basically forced to retreat the queen to d1 (although he could accept the fork and attempt a counterattack with Qg3 I think that winning a pawn and some activity for the exchange isn't worth it).
904,32,6,Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2BnPP2/2NP3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This was the best move I could find in the position threatening Qh4  and a strong attack.  This is all still stuff that's in the GK game DB though -- nothing new yet.
905,32,7,1Na4,b'r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/N1BnPP2/3P3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?  Until now.  I had expected Ne2 so that Qh4  could be met with g3!  In principle it's desirable to eliminate the dark-squared bishop but Qh4  is very strong for black and he simply doesn't have the time for this.
906,32,8,1Qh4+,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/N1BnPP1q/3P3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',A good move -- this is why I expected Ne2.  Now white has only three legal moves g3 (which leads to Qxg3  and a worse situation) Kf1 which leads to all sorts of kingside mating threats and a definite loss of material after 11. Kf1 Nf5 (threatening mate with Qf2) 12. Nxc5 Ng3  or Kd2 as played in the game.
907,32,9,1Kd2,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/N1BnPP1q/3P3P/PPPK2P1/R1BQ3R b kq -',This seems like the best attempt but it turns out to walk into mate...
908,32,10,1Bb4+,b'r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/4p3/NbBnPP1q/3P3P/PPPK2P1/R1BQ3R w kq -',"!  White resigns.  Although White probably sees only 12. c3 (or Nc3) Qf2  13. Qe2 Qxe2# there is a sprightly forced mate after 12. Ke3 which I was excited to find when I played Bb4 .  It goes 12. Ke3 Qg3  13. Qf3 exf4  14. Kxd4 c5  15. Nxc5 (or 15. Kd5 Qg5  16. Kxd6 Qe5#) dxc5  16. Kd5 Qg5  17. Kd6 Qe5#

I was disappointed that my opponent didn't give me a chance to play my (I thought quite beautiful) mating combination but it's still a wonderful demonstration how sometimes all it takes is one bad move out of the opening book to totally cook your goose!"
909,33,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am BL. Fairly standard Queen's Pawn Game. I usually try to play a Queen's Indian Defense.
910,33,1,Rc1,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/2RQKBNR b Kkq -',I feel this was a mistake. The pressure on the knight isn't relieved because I am still allowed Ne4 adding more pressure.
911,33,2,Qd3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1bPPnB2/2NQ4/PP2PPPP/2R1KBNR b Kkq -',I thought he would put my bishop to the question :) with a3 I didn't want to trade just yet thinking I still had options to strengthen my attack.
912,33,3,a3,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1bPPnB2/P1NQ4/1P2PPPP/2R1KBNR b Kkq -',he now moves a3 which finally forces me to make a decision. Retreating the bishop looked bad to me and I assumed he would recapture the bishop with bxc3 (not wanting to trade his rook for a knight this early) resulting in stacked pawns and in my opinion a very weakened queenside. 
913,33,4,Qf6,b'rn2k2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pq2/8/2PPnB2/P1PQ4/4PPPP/2R1KBNR w Kkq -',I continue to attack. I'm usually not one to bring my queen out early but I felt no immediate threat from WT and wanted to keep him on defense.
914,33,5,Nh3,b'rn2k2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pq2/8/2PPnB2/P1PQ3N/4PPPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq -',Now WT has alleviated the threat at f2 and protected his bishop but I'm not sure if this was the best move. knights on the borders are usually targets of mine.
915,33,6,d6,b'rn2k2r/pbp2ppp/1p1ppq2/8/2PPnB2/P1PQ3N/4PPPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',making room for my b knight to develop

917,33,8,O-O,b'rn3rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1ppq2/2nP4/2P2B2/P1P4N/4PPPP/2RQKB1R w K -',BL has already castled and WT's chances of castling are looking pretty slim. WT was never able to sustain any sort of offense.
918,33,9,Bc8,b'rnb2rk1/p1p2ppp/1p1ppq2/2nP4/2P2B2/P1P2P1N/4P1PP/2RQKB1R w K -',my bishop prepares for bxNh3 making castling near impossible for white and creating more doubled pawns.
919,33,10,1Bg5,b'rnb2rk1/p1p2ppp/1p1ppq2/2nP2B1/2P5/P1P2P1N/4P1PP/2RQKB1R b K -',maybe a wasted move by BL perhaps moving bishop to g3 would have been better allowing the knight on h3 to move to a more productive position instead of stuck protecting the bishop.
920,33,11,exd5,b'rnb2rk1/p1p2ppp/1p1p2q1/2np2B1/2P1P3/P1P2P1N/6PP/2RQKB1R w K -',The knight is now mine for the taking! And he must protect the black squared bishop before the knight is captured.

Having already offered to trade light squared bishops white renegs on the deal and chooses to move the bishop for a second time in a game only four moves old.

This game is all about who is gonna flinch first. White has the initiative the space and his queen and Rh1 to work with. Black has more firepower but must defend first. White has a chance to end it right here and now. If he fails he's dead. Black has to defend for his life right now but if he can survive then he's got the goods.

I can understand the frustration of loosing with an minus 300 elo player but his own mistake in 23th move is more than clear. The conclusion is - David can beat the Goliath and in chess you never know - and one bad move really changes everything...

The capture of the light squared bishop and the three pronged attack on queen rook and bishop look so menacing that it would seem black has made a serious error of judgement but how could that be since book moves had been followed all the way. I look for a possible solution and find the only move black has to avoid a serious loss of material.

I didn't bother to take notes at this point knowing that I had just received some expert advice on a game in progress.. a very definite no-no.
