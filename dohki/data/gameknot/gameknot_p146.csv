IF i was to castle He would castle on the oppposite side and he already has a strong attack on my kingside.

26,1,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This seemed like an odd move to me. I've almost always seen 3. c4 instead.

29,1,3,O-O,b'rnbqkbr1/pppp3p/1n2p1p1/4Q3/3N4/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b q -',It would appear that white could have simply captured the pawn on e6 with the knight (if 9. ... dxe6 10. Bxe6 Bxe6 11. Qxe6+ and white would win the rook on the next move).
30,1,4,Qh4,b'rnb1kr2/pppp3p/1n1bp1p1/8/3N3q/1B1P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w q -',The black queen now contains a dual threat: the capture of the knight on d4 and checkmate on h2. Unfortunately for White it is impossible to prevent both.

35,1,9,2f4,b'rnb1k3/ppp4p/1n2p1p1/2Npb1q1/5P2/1B1P2P1/PPP5/R4RK1 b q f3',I had no need to worry about this fork because I had the option of simply attacking the white knight with my queen:
36,1,10,Nc6,b'r1b1k3/ppp1q2p/1nnbp1p1/3p4/5P2/1BNP2P1/PPP5/R4RK1 w q -',Finally got around to developing that knight.

It's not a disadvantage but I prefer a more enclosed type of game and I'd rather not give away too much space from the start.

The idea behind a6 is that black wants to play e5 eventually to chase the white knight off the d4 square and gaining position in the centre. However playing it instantly without a6 is not a good idea. White can play:
5....-e5 6.Bb5-Nbd7 7. Nf5-a6 8.Bxd7-Qxd7. With 6....-Bb7 the outcome is the same. White has a much stronger position at this point. A lot of space first of all and pieces that develop easily. In fact white only needs to castle and develop Bc1. Whereas black still needs to make space to develop his bishops. Still it's being played and I believe it's even a variation but I don't know the name. I wouldn't recommend it though.
By playing 5...-a6 black prevents in fact any piece from taking position at b5. Which is positive because Sicilian often ends up in a race between white and black. White attacking the kings side. Black attacking the queens side. 5...-a6 prepares that attack for black"

I believe that when you don't play the Dragon Sicilian you shouldn't be to afraid of the pawn storm by white on the kings side.
6. Bg5 or Bc4 is followed by e6. The only reason I can think of is that both moves gain a certain control over d5. Bc4 directly and Bg5 by pinning the knight.

Possibilities are to play 32. Nb7-Be5 33.Nd8-Rxd8 34. Nxd8-Kg7 35. Bg3 (or else mate in 2 by playing g5 followed by forced Kh5 and Nf4)- g5 36. Kh5-Bxg3
It's not a done deal yet but black controls the e1 square to promote his pawn. 
Also whites rooks aren't contributing much to the game. And black can easily clean up the pawn on c3 which gives him even more advantage.
Obviously white also still needs to be careful of not being mated by Nf4."

Sadly I have to report on a second loss in my MT against the masters.  This is also the second time that I have castled kingside and my opponent has mounted a successful mating attack.  This attack did not result in me copping Old Matey but I lost ruinous amounts of material which was sufficient grounds for me to wave the white flag.  How did this happen?  Well gameknot analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15890363&fb=1&rnd=0.3149043367856525."

I thought I had things well in control here particularly as I have a rook controlling the h column.  I just wish I could swap Glenda and my b8 rook around though then I could have got an attack going down the h column onto white's doubletons on the g column.  Alas I only realised two moves later that it is the F COLUMN that is under the hammer and white exploits this very well.

Rh6 - this move is meant to be versatile to prepare a future doubling of rooks on the g column and to also defend my knight on f6 which is pinned to my f7 pawn.  Yup the f7 square is certainly gonna be my achillees heel here.  My next move c6 which turned out to be an outright blunder was to prepare such a move as Qc7 followed by Rh8.  But white side-tracked me with 21. Qe3.

A devastating knight fork/discovery combo on Henry Glenda and my rook on b8 now results in ruinous loss of material.  I waved the white flag after white swiped my rook.  Coach Ion is quite correct I still need to brush up on my tactics in order to hold my own against The Titans and to retain Class A status.  The only thing I can say is that I fell into the tactical shot under extreme pressure.  I just hope I can redeem myself a little with the white pieces in my return challenge against Dongoodman.  I hope you have a good read and a nice evening.  Bye for now - Joanne

The position is reasonably open so the bishops are probably worth slightly more than the knights. The white centre would be stronger by the exchange and white would have the semi-open b file for a rook.

GK computer prefers g5 which to me is not a developing move and weakens the black king side terribly. I'm coming to the conclusion that the GK computer is very weak! Do you agree dear reader?

12. bxc3 Nxd5 13. Qh5+ g6 14. Qf3 and white wins back the pawn with advantage.

There is also Nxe5 check in this position which wins the black queen and may have resulted in a balck resignation. Black is given a chance to partially make up for the mistake the previous move.
293,12,35,1hxg6,b'rn2k2r/pbp5/1pq2pp1/4p2Q/2P5/P4PP1/2P4P/R1B2RK1 w kq -',So black takes the knight.

298,12,40,2Qxh8,b'rn5Q/pbp5/1pq1kp2/4p3/2P5/P4PP1/2P4P/R1B2RK1 b - -',so the rook goes.

301,12,43,2Kd6,b'r7/pbp5/npqk1p2/4p3/2P5/P4PPQ/2P4P/R1B2RK1 w - -',But black doesn't! The king steps into the open d file where it can be checked by the rook. Ke7 was better. White can't mate with just a queen she needs support.
302,12,44,2Rd1+,b'r7/pbp5/npqk1p2/4p3/2P5/P4PPQ/2P4P/R1BR2K1 b - -',White again finds the best move.

Ke7 was better although white is obviously winning. Against Ke7. Qh7 check with the long term plan of developing Bc1 and Ra1 to decent squares and maybe h2-h3-h4-h5-h6-h7-h8. Black can't grab the pawn on f3 as the queen is needed to stay near the king for protection for instance preventing checks on d7. It is now White to play and mate in 4 moves. before going on see if you can spot it!
304,12,46,2Be3+,b'r7/pbp5/npq2p2/2k1p3/2P5/P3BPPQ/2P4P/R2R2K1 b - -',White plays the best move. Black is mated in all variations now.

Here I play Black.  My opponent after the initial moves elects to exchange off as quickly as possible.  My goal in the game is to use this to my own advantage by dictating the timings and concentrating towards the center."

686,30,7,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pbp2ppp/8/8/3B4/R4N2/P1P2KPb/qN1Q4 w - -',His counter basically soon had us seesawing between trying to get the other's queen and trying to move our queen out of danger somehow.

This is also violating the opening principle of not moving the queen too often (with a few exceptions) in the beginning develop the pices instead."
696,31,3,Qa5+,b'r1b1k2r/p4ppp/2pPp3/q2n4/5P2/8/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black could not play 11.-Qxd6 due to the binding i.e. white would play 12.c4 and the night can not move because it will loose the queen but this is no fun for black either.
697,31,4,1c4,b'r1b1k2r/p4ppp/2pPp3/2qn4/2P2P2/8/PP1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq c3',I want to move the night so that I can play b4 and consolidate the pawn on d6 that will be really difficult for black to play if I can do that.

706,32,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2.d4 is what white usually plays in the English opening. 1...g6 is preparing for a fianchetto of the king's bishop.
707,32,2,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/1PP5/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',I immediately played b4 to be able to bring my C-pawn ahead which was not well played in my opinion.It can also attack a Knight when developped. This leads to a loose game which brought some difficulty. b4 also allows fianchetto attacking my rook.
708,32,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/1PP5/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',As said before a fianchetto is on its way!
709,32,4,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/1PP5/2N5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This seemed the best move for white. Somehow this turned into my advantage due to black refusing the center.

Instead Bc4 followed by Ne2 was recommended. I studied many games with this variation (for instance Boris Spassky beat Bobby Fischer with it at the Siegen Olympiad) and I have played it as black frequently. However in the 1980s this move came back into fashion combined with the pawn sacrifice which occours in the game.

793,34,31,1Bh5,b'r1bq3k/pp3r1p/4p2Q/n1pP2RB/4P3/8/P4PP1/1R2K3 b - -',Black can't really move his rook. It has to stay on the 7th rank to protect h7 and if it moves then the black queen is tied to f8 otherwise white plays Qf8 mate. So if the rook goes to c7 or e7 d6 is strong or if Rd7 Pxe6 is strong again. So black is more or less forced to protect it.
794,34,32,1Qf6,b'r1b4k/pp3r1p/4pq1Q/n1pP2RB/4P3/8/P4PP1/1R2K3 w - -',This or Qf8 amount to the same.

800,34,38,2Rf8,b'5r1k/pp1b1q1p/4p2Q/n1RP2R1/4P3/8/P4PP1/4K3 w - -',Black threatens my f2 pawn. If Rxa5 Qxf2 actually leads to me getting mated so I have to deal with this threat.

804,34,42,2Bxc6,b'5r1k/pp3q1p/2b1p2Q/2R3R1/4P3/5P2/P5P1/4K3 w - -',At least he gets his bishop to a decent square

809,34,47,2Reg5,b'4r2k/pp2q2p/2b1p2Q/6R1/4P3/5PR1/P5P1/4K3 b - -',I complete the rook manoeuvre. The threat is Rg7

852,37,5,1e5,b'1rbq1rk1/p2p1pbp/2pN2p1/4Pp2/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',A mistake - the classical check on a5 put extra pressure on e5.
853,37,6,1Nc4,b'1rb2rk1/p2p1p1p/2p3p1/q3bp2/2NQ4/2P5/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Nice - but not good enough black exchange pieces and come out with even more material due to the un-developed white pieces.
854,37,7,Bg7,b'1rb1r1k1/p2p1pbp/2p3p1/N4p2/8/2P5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I was considering Rxb2 but the black bishop is very strong.
855,37,8,Ba6,b'1r2r1k1/p2p1pbp/b1p3p1/5p2/2N5/2P5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Again pressure with the bishops using the binding on the king.
856,37,9,Bxc4,b'1r2r1k1/p2p1pbp/2p3p1/5p2/2b5/2P5/PP2BPPP/R2K3R w - -',It was also good to exchange the rook with the Night and Bishop but I preferd it this way.
857,37,10,Rb4,b'6k1/p2p1p1p/2p3p1/5p2/1rB5/2b5/P4PPP/R4K2 w - -',White resigned black has 3 pawns and will get the bishop (or rook).
858,38,0,d5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',Vienna game - a little early to open the center but ok I guess.
859,38,1,Bb3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Not Bb5+ as this will only force him to develop a pice.
860,38,2,Be7,b'rnb1k2r/ppq1bppp/5n2/3pp3/8/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Not sure this is good I was expecting Bg4 to keep the pressure.
861,38,3,Nxe5,b'r1b1k2r/ppq1bppp/2n2n2/3pN3/8/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White win a pawn due to the problems black have after Bf4.
862,38,4,Nfd7,b'r1b1k2r/ppqnbppp/8/3pn3/5B2/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',I would have played Bd6 to remove the pressure from the Queen but then he has the problem with the king - I believe that 5.-d5 was a little too fast.
863,38,5,1Nc3,b'r1b1k2r/ppqnb1pp/5p2/3pn3/3P1B2/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Always keep the pressure if possible there is no reason to take the night yet if you can get more.
864,38,6,1Bb4,b'r1b1k2r/ppqn2pp/5p2/3pn3/1b1P1B2/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Mistake black had to move the Queen out of the line Bd6 would still loose but not so fast.
865,38,7,Bxc3,b'r1b1k2r/ppqn2pp/5p2/3pP3/5B2/1Bb5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Loosing the queen but 13.-fxe5 was not much better due to 14.Nxd5.
866,38,8,Bb4,b'r1b1k2r/ppBn2pp/5P2/3p4/1b6/1B6/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w kq -',I guess black just wanna finish - this is a mate in 3 but why even consider to defend himself.
867,38,9,1Qxd5,b'r1b1k2r/ppBn2pp/5P2/3Q4/1b6/1B6/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b kq -',Black resigned there is a mate on f7 max 3 moves left i.e. 16.-Rf8 17.Qe6+Be7 18.Qxe7#
868,39,0,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6p1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq g6',Recently I decided that openings are pointless. In which I decided to embark on the quest of proving that. Here we go.
869,39,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/8/3p2p1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I decided I needed to contest the center immediately here before I get completely over run by white pieces.
870,39,2,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp2/7p/3p2B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Well I figure at least i'll have a semi open g file that my rook can control. I really have no idea what I'm doing I played it on a whim.
871,39,3,Bh4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp2/7p/3p4/3PP2B/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',The bishiop is rather powerful here preventing me from developing my e pawn
872,39,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp2/7p/8/2BPp2B/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',I like the idea of Nc3 for white here. White already has a pawn advantage and a more solid structure he should take advantage.
873,39,5,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp2/5n1p/8/2BPp2B/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',It's hard to fathom this move I cannot understand it. Oh well though I figured I need all the help i can get.
874,39,6,g3,b'rnbqkbr1/ppp1pp2/5n1p/8/2BPp2B/2P3P1/PP3P1P/RN1QK1NR b KQq -',I expected the moves rather to be 7. Qb3 Rg7 8. Ne2

879,39,11,Qc6,b'r3kbr1/ppp1pp2/1nq4p/5b2/3PN3/1BP3P1/PP2QP1P/R3K1NR w KQq -',Pinning the knight and attempting to turn the aggression around. I feel as if I've finally reached equality...at least roughly.

882,39,14,1d5,b'r3k3/ppp1pp1b/1nq2b1p/2NP4/6rP/1BP2P2/PP2Q3/R3K1NR b KQq -',A horrible mistake on white's part. At the time I felt as if before this move I finally had the advantage but looking now with proper play white should still be winning. 17. fxg4 Qxh1 18. 0-0-0 Qxh4 19. Nf3 Bg5 seems to keep white's initiative.
883,39,15,1Rxh4,b'r3k3/ppp1pp1b/1nq4p/2NP4/6rR/1BP2P2/PP2Q3/R3K1N1 b Qq -',Alternatively white can try to get the most he can for his queen. 18. Kf1 Qxc5 19. fxg4 Bd3 20. Rxh4 Bxe2+ 21. Nxe2 Nxd5 22. Nd4 Ne3
884,39,16,2Qb5+,b'r3k3/ppp1pp1b/1n5p/1Q1P4/6R1/1BP2P2/PP1K4/1q6 b q -',White attempts to get some sort attack going to force my queen out of the picture but it's too late. White's king is in a mighty amount of dange
885,39,17,Qxb2+,b'3rk3/pp2pp1b/1nP4p/1Q6/3R4/1BP2P2/Pq1K4/8 w - -',White ran out of time at this point but his position was pretty hopeless. The conclusions I've been drawing from playing odd openings is openings really are pretty insignificant. Although one may come into the middle game with a slight disadvantage solid knowledge of the middle game and especially that of the endgame will level things out. I'll leave the opening knowledge to the masters.
