This was a real roller-coaster of a game.  I decided it was time to challenge Mike again.  Here are my current stats against him +0, Won: 47 (48%), Lost: 47 (48%), Draws: 2 (2%), 96 games.  So despite the 200 point difference in our rating we are pretty evenly matched and will have soon played 100 games against each other!  Mike has been inflicting a lot of passivitis on me in a lot of my games against him with different eventual outcomes.  In this game it is no different, through a large part of the middlegame, Mike has me tied down.  Glenda briefly leads a break out rally but she is exchanged off and Mike re-establishes his bind with a bone in the throat and more.  Mike releases the bind and there follows a race to the promotion square and wins the race by just one move.  I am also a pawn down.  But will Glenda be able to save the day here?  Please feel free to read the GA below to find out or simply read on.  Mike starts with 1. c4 as he often does and I reply with f5 transposing the game into an Anglo-Dutch Defense."

7. ... Nf6  8. Bd3 Rb8  9. Qc1 O-O  10. O-O d6 11. Re1 Be6  12. f4 Bd4+  13. Be3 Bxc3  14. bxc3 a5 ...

The Nf6, I think, is meant to threaten capture of the center in order to force me to move my knight from c3, so black's bishop can threaten my rook with Bxb2 followed with a Rb8.  I can see the necessity of Bd3 because of this.

However, in response to Rb8, which threatens Rxb2, I'd either move my own rook to guard b2 or I'd move my pawn (f4) to threaten his bishop which is kinda the crux of the problem anyways??  Am I missing something?  Then, if he takes my knight (Bxc3), I take Bxc3 and the threat to my rook is gone.  If, instead, he presses the issue with Bd4, I can do e5, threatening his newly developed knight, which can either retreat (and he loses development), or he can move Nd5, where I Nxd5.  From there, if he goes Bxb2, I simply Rb2, pinning his bishop to his rook.  If he takes my knight instead (cxd5), then I can move my pawn (c3) and the threat is once again dispelled.

I didn't see all this mid-game, but I think Bd2 is actually just fine."

Were safety hopeless—rather than divide
Aught with one loved save love and liberty.

I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock,
Received our prow, and all was storm and fear,
And bade thee cling to me through every shock;
This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.

I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,
Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground
When overworn with watching, ne’er to rise
From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.

The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,
And men and nature reeled as if with wine.
Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?
For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.

And when convulsive throes denied my breath
The faintest utterance to my fading thought,
To thee—to thee—e’en in the gasp of death
My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.

Thus much and more; and yet thou lov’st me not,
And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.
Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot
To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.
