19,1,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',"OK that's a new one. The common continuation is 2...d4 3.Nce2 e5 at which point White can do 4.Ng3 with fair play.
Checking with GK and offline DBs the game move has been played before - but with uniformly disastrous results by Black. Taking with the pawn gives him counterplay however; the knight capture is definitely safer.
"
20,1,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Np3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',"?! There are a couple of other games in the database and both went for 4.Nxf6. At the time it seemed to me that exchanging the knights offered Black far too much counterplay as after 4.Nxf6+ Qxf6 5.Nf3 Bc5 6.Be2 Bg4 7.O-O Nc6 8.d3 O-O-O Black has the freer game initiative and pressure against White's king position. The drawbacks of not exchanging the knights were less apparent to me at the time. Taught by painful experience I can now say that not exchanging knights is a definite strategic mistake: it is dangerous to keep that piece in play in the kind of position which Black gains by this pawn sacrifice.

21,1,3,Qxe5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3n4/3NQ3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',I studied this move for a long time before settling for it. White is literally putting his head into a nest of wasps here. Black gets significant development and a lot of mobile threats against both White's queen and the weak c2 and g2 squares- But - significantly - in two extended key lines (one of which we see played out in this game) it seemed to me that White was able to hold on to the advantage despite this.
22,1,4,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3nb3/3NQ3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',This is one of those lines. The game now follows my analysis up until move 11 at which point Black throws me a curve...
23,1,5,Ne3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3nb3/4Q3/2B5/4N3/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',?! The computer flags this as a mistake preferring instead 7.Bb3 with a small plus to White. However I disliked the situation after 7... Nc6 8.Qf4 g5 where Black seems able to hunt the White queen at will.
24,1,6,Nxc4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/4Q3/2N5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',One knight down one more to go ...

26,1,8,Qe7,b'r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n1b3/8/2N1Q3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',White's problem here is that Black gets all the development while White has difficulty parking his Queen anywhere useful. That along with the open e-file down to the still uncastled king is a major worry at this point. During the game I was still confident that I would be able to ride this out but looking at the situation today I believe Black has full compensation for the pawn; certainly I would have no qualms playing Black's side of the board. Indeed the computer evaluation shows a minor plus for Black.
27,1,9,1Ne3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n1b3/8/4Q3/4N3/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',"This was the move I relied on to save the situation: from e3 the knight shields its exposed king and defends the major weaknesses on c2 and g2. I considered and rejected two alternatives:
A) 10.Ne2 f5! and I considered White's position to be lost beyond recovery.
B) 10.b3 Bxc4 11.Qxe7+ Bxe7 12.bxc4 Nd4 13.Kd1 and White may at best have equal play."
28,1,10,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1q1pp/2n1b3/5p2/Q7/4N3/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',"! And this is where I got the first nasty surprise. I hadn't really looked at this option disregarding it on strategic grounds: ""Black cannot castle long because he will be castling straight into the side of the board where White has an advantage in both space and active officers!""
Except of course that White's ""advantage in space and active officers"" amounts to one piece only: a queen ""actively"" chased about the board by those pesky light officers of Black's...
What Black gains by this operation is quite interesting: king safety instant control of the d-file added pressure on White's uncastled king position full development of the rook. Count the number and color of active pieces on the board for a moment: White has two Black has six! (yes the pawn is an active piece too in this situation). I believe the GK analysis understates Black's advantage when it calculates it to a mere 0.47 pts."

""So right now I am seriously worrying about the exposed state of my king. Well actually that has been a worry since move 5 or so! And I am considering what to do about it. His move could signal a desire to move the knight (probably to b4 possibly to e5) and I have to look out for queen traps then. And I learned early on in my chess career that castling to different sides meant the person whose pawns reached the king first would have a general advantage... So what to do? Well I would *love* to castle long even if that does mean that my one-pawn advantage is lessened a bit. But I don't think I will actually have the chance to do that.
- 13.b2-b3 is a no-go on strategic grounds as he will just exchange the dark bishops and have an open avenue to my king.
- 13.d2-d4 is blocked unless I prepare by c3 first.
- 13.c2-c3 is also a no-go as it leads to the unravelling of my kingside. Main line: 13.c3 Rd3 14.Nf4 Rd8 15.d4 g5 16.Ne2 f4 17.Nc4 f3 -/+
- 13.d2-d3 does not inspire a lot of confidence either I think. The only thing going for it is that it allows Bc1-d2 and I think I know  who is the better after 13.d3 g5 14.Bd2 f4 15.Nc4 Bxc4 16.Qxc4 Re8 17.Qe4 Qxe4 18.dxe4 Rxe4 - and it sure ain't me!
However the GK analysis points to d3 as being the best option after all after 13.d3 g5 14.f4! gxf4 15.Qxf4 Bg7 16.O-O Rhe8 17.Rf2 Nd4 18.Nxd4 Bxd4 19.c3 Bc5 with practically equal play."

White of course cannot castle (the knight is hanging) and the only reasonable alternative I could see was 15.c3 in order to facilitate d2-d4 cutting off the dangerous g1-a7 diagonal. However on 15.c3 there would likely follow 15...Bd5 16.Nxd5 Rxd5 and now the sought-for d2-d4 looks more than creating a nice tomb for the king than erecting bolvarks of defence.
The possibility of d2-d4 never entered my mind - it looked (and looks) like it simply cuts off the queen from further influence on the 4th row while adding nothing to the safety of the king. Now GK claims it is the path to (relative) safety after: 15.d4 Be7 16.Bd2 Bf6 17.c3 Rhe8 18.Qb5 Qf3 19.Rf1 Qe4 20.a4 Bd5 21.O-O-O a6. But if you happen to play out that line however you may notice that the computer - being at the very limit of its event horizon - miss the deadly continuation 22.Qc5 (forced) 22...Be7 and White can resign: the queen is trapped."

Also b2-b4 is now in the cards.""
As they stand those comments are still true. However the position is almost hopeless; the only real hope for White at this point is to create a sufficiently double-edged position that Black may make a mistake. A measure of how unbalanced the game is at this point with White still nominally a pawn ahead is the ""best"" line given by GK: 16. g4 fxg4 17. f5 Bd5 18. Nxd5 Rxd5 19. Ng3 Qh3 20. Kd1 Re8 21. Bf4 Qg2 22. Kc1 Rxf5 23. Nxf5 Qxh1+ ... and White loses the rook."

178,7,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',d4 standard.
179,7,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',standard!!!
180,7,4,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',exd5! I was soooooo disappointed after I saw this move obviously he was trying to avoid the mainline of french defense.
181,7,5,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',what else but exd5 I was thinking to offer him a draw but then I found out if I draw the game I would lose 5 points so I continued with exd5. Just kidding :D
182,7,6,Bf4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',bf4 a natural developing move
183,7,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Nc6 develops the knight and adds some pressure on white's center.
184,7,8,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Bb5 develops the lsb and pins the knight.
185,7,9,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Bd7 unpins.
186,7,10,Bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2B5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Bxc6 it seems that my opponent hated my knight and captured it straight away. Maybe he was just going for a draw. 
187,7,11,Bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',what else bxc6
188,7,12,Nd2,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Nd2 I wasn't sure why this move was played I think Ne2 would be better because white would be ready to castle and take note if Nf3 was played Bb5 could be a possible response which stops white from castle and also the bishop is not doing anything on c6 apart from babysitting d5 pawn.
189,7,13,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Nf6 develops the knight and maybe Nh5 at some point just to kick away the dsb.
190,7,14,Ngf3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Ngf3 again if I were white I definitely play Ne2.  
191,7,15,Bb5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Bb5 stops white from castle and also the bishop is now functioning on a much better diagonal.
192,7,16,a3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',a3 this is not a good move at all white tries to stop black from playing Bb4 but b2 should have being considered by white and he can play c4 for the next move kicks away black' lsb and then castle. 
193,7,17,Nh5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p3n/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Knight on f3 is now blocking white queen from watching over h5 square  so black can now play Nh5 attacks white's dsb.
194,7,18,1Be3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p3n/3P4/P3BN2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Be3 was played
195,7,19,1Bd6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/1b1p3n/3P4/P3BN2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Bd6 not only develops the dsb but also gives support on f4 square for the knight to land. 
196,7,20,1b3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/1b1p3n/3P4/PP2BN2/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Finally white realized my lsb was a giant pest b3 prepares for c4 a little too late white never had a chance to castle in the game let's see what happened.
197,7,21,1Nf4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/1b1p4/3P1n2/PP2BN2/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Nf4 the threat is Nxg2#
198,7,22,1Bxf4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/1b1p4/3P1B2/PP3N2/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Bxf4 pretty much forced white could not play c4 because black would play Nxg2+ after Kf1 which is the only move Nxe3+ forking the king and the queen thus fxe3 must be played then dxc4 black would have time to retreat the lsb. However we don't have that.
199,7,23,1Bxf4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p4/3P1b2/PP3N2/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Bxf4 now black has a bishop pair against two knights.
200,7,24,1c4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p4/2PP1b2/PP3N2/3N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq c3',c4 finally played.
201,7,25,Qe7+,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/8/1b6/2PP1b2/P4N2/3N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',after the pawns were exchanged I played a in between move Qe7+ the reason is simple I was hoping for white to play Qe2 so i would exchange queens and keep the bishop pair advantage in the late middle game or end game. 
202,7,26,1Kf1,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/8/1b6/2PP1b2/P4N2/3N1PPP/R2Q1K1R b kq -',but black didn't want to exchange queens and played Kf1.
203,7,27,1Bd7,b'r3k2r/pppbqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/P4N2/3N1PPP/R2Q1K1R w kq -',Bd7 then I realized it wasn't an accurate move because it allows white to play Qb3. 
204,7,28,1Qb3,b'r3k2r/pppbqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/PQ3N2/3N1PPP/R4K1R b kq -',Qb3 As I expected 
205,7,29,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pppbqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/PQ3N2/3N1PPP/R4K1R w - -',I could not play some random moves for example like b6 that would be disaster because Re1 wins the queen however this move is very risky if white plays carefully he can use the half open b file and the pawns to crash my queen side. 
206,7,30,1Re1,b'2kr3r/pppbqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/PQ3N2/3N1PPP/4RK1R b - -',Re1! What?  I just couldn't believe it! Rb1 would be a killer! I just couldn't believe what white played!! 
207,7,31,1Qd6,b'2kr3r/pppb1ppp/3q4/8/2PP1b2/PQ3N2/3N1PPP/4RK1R w - -',Qd6
208,7,32,1Ne4,b'2kr3r/pppb1ppp/3q4/8/2PPNb2/PQ3N2/5PPP/4RK1R b - -',Ne4 attacks the queen
209,7,33,1Qa6,b'2kr3r/pppb1ppp/q7/8/2PPNb2/PQ3N2/5PPP/4RK1R w - -',Qa6 bring my queen close to the king so she can help with the defense but Nc5 could be absolutely irritating and also I was thinking if white would play something like Ng5 threats the fork. 
210,7,34,1Rb1,b'2kr3r/pppb1ppp/q7/8/2PPNb2/PQ3N2/5PPP/1R3K1R b - -',luckily none of those happened Rb1 was played  but my queen is in position to defend. 
211,7,35,1b6,b'2kr3r/p1pb1ppp/qp6/8/2PPNb2/PQ3N2/5PPP/1R3K1R w - -',b6 stops Nc5
212,7,36,2Ke2,b'2kr3r/p1pb1ppp/qp6/8/2PPNb2/PQ3N2/4KPPP/1R5R b - -',Ke2 my opponent wanted to bring out the h1 rook.
213,7,37,2Ba4,b'2kr3r/p1p2ppp/qp6/8/b1PPNb2/PQ3N2/4KPPP/1R5R w - -',Ba4 does not give white anytime to breathe. 
214,7,38,2Qc3,b'2kr3r/p1p2ppp/qp6/8/b1PPNb2/P1Q2N2/4KPPP/1R5R b - -',Qc3 so queen can still defend c4.
215,7,39,2Rhe8,b'2krr3/p1p2ppp/qp6/8/b1PPNb2/P1Q2N2/4KPPP/1R5R w - -',Rhe8 non stop attack.
216,7,40,2Kd3,b'2krr3/p1p2ppp/qp6/8/b1PPNb2/P1QK1N2/5PPP/1R5R b - -',Kd3 if white play queen d3 f5 would be played and the knight would be a goner. 
217,7,41,2c5,b'2krr3/p4ppp/qp6/2p5/b1PPNb2/P1QK1N2/5PPP/1R5R w - c6',c5 tries to break down d4. 
218,7,42,2d5,b'2krr3/p4ppp/qp6/2pP4/b1P1Nb2/P1QK1N2/5PPP/1R5R b - -',Epic blunder by white d5!!
219,7,43,2Rxd5+,b'2k1r3/p4ppp/qp6/2pr4/b1P1Nb2/P1QK1N2/5PPP/1R5R w - -',Rxd5+ c4 is pinned.... 
220,7,44,2Ke2,b'2k1r3/p4ppp/qp6/2pr4/b1P1Nb2/P1Q2N2/4KPPP/1R5R b - -',Ke2 sadly that is the only move.
221,7,45,2Rxe4+,b'2k5/p4ppp/qp6/2pr4/b1P1rb2/P1Q2N2/4KPPP/1R5R w - -',Rxe4suddenly white's position got crashed and white king is now walking on a rope covered by olive oil. White could have resigned in this position.
222,7,46,2Kf1,b'2k5/p4ppp/qp6/2pr4/b1P1rb2/P1Q2N2/5PPP/1R3K1R b - -',But he decided to play on a bit maybe was hoping I would play something like Re1+ still kidding :D
223,7,47,2Rxc4,b'2k5/p4ppp/qp6/2pr4/b1r2b2/P1Q2N2/5PPP/1R3K1R w - -',Rxc4 that's obvious and black resigned. because to prolong the game white would have to play Qxc4 but that is pointless to continue.  If white played something else let's say Qa1 hides in the corner avoids the discover check then Rc1 discovered double check and mate(lol...). In conclusion: white had so many chances but he missed too much and d5 was the main reason that he lost the game so quick. Still I think it's a very interesting game you may notice that white's king had a very bad day he went from e1 to f1 f1 to e2 e2 to d3 d3 to e2 again and then eventually back to f1. Anyway I hope you enjoyed it see you guys next time! :D

White starts with (A04) the Reti opening."

On reflection Qxd4 would have been better although white is still ahead...bf4 and white following with his move exchanging pieces on a6 might have let me catch up.

He has to move the queen and in doing so he must threat the knight so to keep the balance after BxBh4. Now I think that I would have played c4 as white as a way to create complications.

White still has an edge here. After b3 the black queen is out of the defence of the king and white has plenty of game at the kingside provided he is careful with his backrank (Kd2 can be a good option in the near future). So that's the lesson: don't resign just because something went wrong if not disastrous. Thank you for reading I hope you enjoyed. 
460,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi all! This is my second 90+45 tourney game. This time white engage a Stone Wall Defense or Berlin's Defense. I arrived very late to the match because previously I was on another chess tourney (from my University). My time was 45min left (from 90) when I sat down so I played very fast to regain time (I almost didn't used my time I tried to think all in my opponent's time so I missed some good moves)
461,17,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',I didn't know my opponent not even his chess rating (ELO) so I tried to play something I knew but already with f5 I was a little lost (I haven't studied this yet) so I applied chess principles and pawn structure for the opening. 
462,17,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"2. c4 is one of the main line the other one here is 2. g3 (which I didn't know)

464,17,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Incredibly e6 it's not the most played continuation but g6 O.o (but it's the second main line or the old one)

I analyse both in the match and yes Black's black bishop is his best and very active bishop so it's a good move to play Ba3 to exchange it but I didn't do it because i'm used to play this kind of structure as white with Bb2 now it will follow several knights moves in order to stop e5 and put a knight over there.

Black wants to play an attack to the king side and taking Nxe4 it allows Black to take with f-pawn making an open file for his rooks.

D-file is closed better is Ndf6 (which allows black to play Bd7 Be8 Kh8 g5 etc). Other plan could be a queen side attack/stop playing a5. Finally Black can always play Nxe5 to try to simplify.

It's very difficult to play such a closed position but in this kind of position white shouldn't desperate and always remember that he/she is better (in the position) and play with this little advantage trying to make more and more pressure until the advantage is enough to open the game and reach a winning final.

669,22,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Another game from Modern Benoni Tournament VIII.  From an even opening White makes a slip that allows Black to win a pawn.  Shortly afterwards Black returns it to obtain a far advanced passed pawn on the Q-side.  White's defences seem to be holding until two apparently insignificant errors in a row puts the game out of White's reach.

At some point she may be considering bringing the King's knight out via f3 and d2 to c4 - a thematic spot for the knight.  This would be accompanied or followed by a general expansion in the centre intending to break through at e5.  This is just one of several plans she could have adopted.  Also playable at this juncture are 6.e4 and 6.Nf3.

In this line the knight is intended to pull back to c7 putting pressure upon d5 and also supporting the subsequent pawn expansion (...a6; ...b5) on the Q-side.  Again one plan - or at least one approach to a plan - among many possible.

Its purpose is to deny Black the use of g4 (often a place where a bishop or sometimes a knight arrives to outflank White's centre).  His right flank thus guarded White plans in the centre may go ahead the more smoothly.  That is (or was) the idea at any rate.
677,22,8,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/n2p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NPP/PP2PPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Delaying the advance of White's e-pawn.  After 10...Nc7  11.e4 b5?!  12.e5! is 'very strong' according to Bill Hartston.  Meanwhile the game Korchnoi-Tal USSR Championship 1962 went 11...Nd7  12.Re1 Ne8 and Black's game never really did get going after that.  Although he did conjure up play on the Q-side White always had the ascendancy in the centre and on the K-side where they counted.

There is however a potential downside to that namely 12...a6  13.a5 - a real nuisance if I want my Q-side play to counter-balance White's operations in the centre.  This way when the time is right I can force the b-pawn forward without worrying about axb6e.p.

It serves two possible functions: to keep the White knight out of c4 but also to put pressure on the e2-square.

Ordinarily one gives up a fianchetto bishop extremely reluctantly even when winning a pawn; especially if ones opponent retains the same-colour bishop.

Or maybe she hoped to induce an exchange of Queens by leaving the bishop loose on d2.  But it seems likely too that she figured that it would be easier to hold up Black's Q-side with a c-pawn available...

Moving the king over to the kingside doesn't offer much safety especially with the kingside rook gone. On the queenside White has a nice open file and pawns that can rush down and open more files. No strategic ideas at this point but the opponent just keeps me busy.

Not at all pretty of course with that king in the center but at least I am doing useful moves and I know what the opponent is going to do - fianchetto and castle kingside. My job is to develop the pieces and throw my kingside pawns at his king's position.

799,26,12,2Bd2,b'1rq1k1n1/1ppbbp2/p2p2p1/7p/2PN1Pn1/1Q1P2P1/P2BP1BP/R4RK1 b - -',As a result the bishop has to take a much less active position and grant me another tempo. Good - I get on with the pawn storm.

Seek exchanges of course the more so since White is already up in material. A better plan would be Qb6 with the idea of Ba5 and then Qc7 with an assured exchange of queens. Let Black take on g3 and open the h-file: with no heavy pieces on this side of the board this is not a problem for White.

Exchanging the light-squared bishop would be a good idea of course but it is simply not feasible at the moment."

Why - because my knight is out on the rim while the opponent's bishop and  queen are quite active. That's what a sober look tells me. During the game however I felt somewhat elevated because of the successful counter-strike and tried to continue in the same attacking manner.

This is a difficult thing in chess. When you gain a success you tend to try and go on hammering though the right thing to do might be to switch onto a lower gear and play cautiously. Look how it could have spoilt the game for me."

The king just moves to b7 and covers all possible invasion points. Taking the h-file would make much more sense - it would tie down the knight. Also on a1 the rook is vulnerable across the diagonal - which creates more tactical opportunities.

White can try to invade with the rook to start attacking from behind and if he can knock out my f-pawn his clump of pawns can give me real trouble. I can try to exchange rooks by Ra8 but White doesn't have to go for it. So again I shouldn't try to force a quick win (there are still 23 moves to go!) but slow down and start improving my position.
814,26,27,4Nd5,b'1r6/1k3p2/3p4/2pn1P2/1p3P2/1P1P2P1/5K2/R7 w - -',To begin with I need to protect the f-pawn. The plan is to move it to f6 if need be and move the king to c6 if White's rook penetrates along the h-file.
815,26,28,4Re1,b'1r6/1k3p2/3p4/2pn1P2/1p3P2/1P1P2P1/5K2/4R3 b - -',No problem here e6-e8 fields are protected. That's why the pawn should remain on f7 for the time being - it covers e6. In the meantime I can move the king closer to the center.

817,26,30,Nb5,b'4r3/1k3p2/3p4/1np2P2/1p3P2/1P1P1KP1/8/R7 w - -',Once White's invasion attempts are restricted I can start creating threats of my own. Here the threat is Nd4+ winning the b-pawn or f5-pawn.
818,26,31,Nd4+,b'4r3/1k3p2/3p4/2p2P2/1p1n1P2/1P1P1KP1/8/1R6 w - -',The b-pawn is protected but this ties down the rook and I can get a bit more active. The king moves to protect the f5-pawn but this exposes it to my rook.
819,26,32,Nxf5,b'6r1/1k3p2/3p4/2p2n2/1p3P2/1P1P2PK/8/1R6 w - -',The f5-pawn goes and now White struggles (successfully) to save his other pawns.
820,26,33,5Rf1,b'4r3/1k3p2/3p4/2pn4/1p3PP1/1P1P2K1/8/5R2 b - -',Now it is me who is seeking to break into White's position with the rook; White defends against this.
821,26,34,5Rf3,b'8/1k3p2/3p4/2pn4/1p3PP1/1P1PrRK1/8/8 b - -',The rook is in but going for an exchange right now is doubtful. The knight will need quite a few moves to attack the d or b pawns and in the meantime White can get active with his pawns - and if he cannot break through with them he can at least penetrate with the king and attack the backward d-pawn. So even here I should not rush it. The king should come into play and give a hand in holding up White's pawns which are about to move.
822,26,35,Ke7,b'8/4kp2/3p4/2pn1PP1/1p6/1P1PrRK1/8/8 w - -',Now that the king is in White's fortunes take a turn for the worst. At this point he probably does not have chances for active game but passive defense is still a possibility. The point is that the pawns cannot break through as long as the knight is on d5 but being there it cannot attack the d and b pawns. So White exchanges rooks and tries to tie the knight down to d5.
823,26,36,6Ke4,b'8/4kp2/3p4/2pn1PP1/1p2K3/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',Fortunately the knight can give a few checks and at the same time maneuver to a better spot.

826,26,39,Ke6,b'8/5p2/3pkP2/2p3P1/1p1nK3/1P1P4/8/8 w - -',"White resigned.

The takeaway from this game: early material loss is very annoying but by careful play this can be made up sometimes. On the other hand being an exchange up early on may set you up for trouble because while the rooks are not active you are essentially a piece down.

Another consideration should be his knight to f3 which would have gotten him closer to castling kingside and would have helped control the e5 and d4 central squares. What Nd2 does though is threaten a fork with e4! If I don't play judiciously I could get behind in material.

Six pawn moves in the first ten moves. As a general rule you shouldn't play more than two or three pawn moves in the opening phase of the game especially if the center is not closed or fixed and especially if you're behind in development. There are exceptions to the rule of course but in this case he should have kept developing instead of moving his pawns.

I have developed all but one of my minor pieces my king is safely castled my rook my bishops and my knight control the center. My opponent hasn't castled hasn't developed his kingside at all and has minimal control of the center. How do you think I should proceed?"

I am threatening to take his d4 bishop with my queen since it's pinned due to his king being on the same semi-open file as my rook. I am also threatening to fork his king and his rook by way of Nc2+. Besides winning the exchange this second threat also takes away white's ability to castle which would be devastating since his king would remain in the center with little chances of surviving without heavy loss of material.

Threatens to win b2 pawn and consequently my rook or trade his bishop for a rook and a pawn if I don't proceed accurately. Fianchettoed bishops like this can be very powerful since they control the longest diagonal on the board however in this game it is too late since he is down two pawns he is behind in development and his king is still in the center by move 13!
