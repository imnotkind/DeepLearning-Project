0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',oldgus (warren) and I began playing each other months ago during a Queen's Gambit tourney.  We struck up a friendship and began playing each other regularly.  Eventually we decided to play a 100 game match.  At the time of this annotation my record against oldgus is 6 wins 18 losses and two draws (although our record against each other is roughly equal over the last 10 games).  This annotation was done without assistance from computer although the gameknot computer analysis is available.
1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I haven't played the King's Indian too much and wanted to learn.
2,0,2,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',All standard book moves to this point.
3,0,3,f3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',From my reading White has employed the Samisch Variation.  White's center is relatively stable and he is in position to begin King-side attack.  A typical plan for White might include Qd2 Bh6 g2-g4 and h2-h4.  However 6.f3 does inhibit his N on g1.
4,0,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ c6',6...c5 from my reading has become a popular method of attacking White's center.  This leads to the sacrifice of a pawn by Black.
5,0,5,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',At this point Black has a nice diagonal for his DSB a lead in development and a hole on d4.  However White also is eying the d5 square with his N.
6,0,6,1Ba3,b'r1br2k1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/8/2P1P3/B1N2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR b KQ -',Black is likely to move Nd7 and 10. Ba3 anticipates this move.
7,0,7,1a5,b'r1br2k1/1p2ppbp/2n2np1/p7/2P1P3/B1N2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR w KQ a6',Queen side operations for Black?  Nb4 is now on the table.
8,0,8,Be6,b'r2r2k1/1p2ppbp/2n1bnp1/p7/2P1P3/B1N2P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR w K -',Development.  And besides an exchange of R's would help White's King to escape over to the Q-side.
9,0,9,1Nd5,b'r2r2k1/1p2ppbp/2n1bnp1/p2N4/2P1P3/B4P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b K -',And White's N moves to d5.  Taking the N would lead to recapture with the c-pawn and a nasty line of White pawns.
10,0,10,1Nb4,b'r2r2k1/1p2ppbp/4bnp1/p2N4/1nP1P3/B4P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR w K -',12...Nb4 eying Nc2+ and the end of White's DSB.
11,0,11,1Nxe7+,b'r2r2k1/1p2Npbp/4bnp1/p7/1nP1P3/B4P2/PP4PP/3RKBNR b K -',Black goes down 2 pawns
12,0,12,axb4,b'3r3k/1p2Npbp/4bnp1/8/1pP1P3/5P2/PP4PP/4KBNR w K -',Black is down 2 pawns and his Q-side pawn structure is not happy.  And Ne7 is not pleasing.  Black does have the B-pair and a lead in development.
13,0,13,Ra8,b'r6k/1p3pbp/4bnp1/3N4/1pP1P3/5P2/PP4PP/4KBNR w K -',Looking at a2 while the DSB is looking at b2.
14,0,14,1Nxb4,b'r6k/1p3pbp/4bnp1/8/1NP1P3/5P2/PP4PP/4KBNR b K -',hmmm Black is down 3 pawns.
15,0,15,1Ne2,b'r6k/1p1n1pbp/4b1p1/8/1NP1P3/5P2/PP2N1PP/4KB1R b K -',White allows the DSB to take on b2.  If White tried to protect b2 say with 18. b3 then 18...Bc3+ loses Nb4.
16,0,16,Nc5,b'r6k/1p3p1p/4b1p1/2nN4/2P1P3/5P2/Pb2N1PP/4KB1R w K -',18...Nc5?  Here I believe Black errs.  Black was thinking that he could simply grab a2 later and wanted to develop more pieces into the attack.  The R on a2 would have been nice and caused White much concern.  
17,0,17,2Nec3,b'r6k/1p3p1p/4b1p1/2nN4/2P1P3/2N2P2/Pb4PP/4KB1R b K -',Bluntly Black just missed this move.  a2 is well guarded and White's N's are connected.  It's not clear where Black can break through.  Black demonstrates his lack of calculation finesse.
18,0,18,2Na4,b'r6k/1p3p1p/4b1p1/3N4/n1P1P3/2N2P2/Pb4PP/4KB1R w K -',Obviously seeking to attack Nc3.
19,0,19,Bd4,b'r6k/1p3p1p/4b1p1/3N4/n1PbP3/5P2/P5PP/3NKB1R w K -',Black didn't want to trade N for B.  And the DSB is nicely centralized.
20,0,20,2Nc7,b'r6k/1pN2p1p/4b1p1/8/n1PbP3/5P2/P5PP/3NKB1R b K -',This was anticipated and it made me sad.  I wanted to keep my B-pair.
21,0,21,fxe6,b'2r4k/1p5p/4p1p1/8/n1PbP3/5P2/P5PP/3NKB1R w K -',Black still has more active pieces White's extra pawns are problematic.
22,0,22,Na4,b'2r4k/1p5p/4p1p1/8/n1PbP3/4NP2/P2K2PP/5B1R w - -',Black seems to be floundering without a plan at this point.  
23,0,23,2Bd3,b'2r4k/1p5p/4p1p1/8/n1PbP3/3BNP2/P2K2PP/7R b - -',And White's pieces are joining the game while Black's K is sleeping in the corner.
24,0,24,Ra8,b'r6k/1p5p/4p1p1/8/n1P1P3/2bBNP2/P3K1PP/7R w - -',Still trying to grab a2
25,0,25,2Nd5,b'r6k/1p5p/4p1p1/3N4/2P1PP2/2bB4/Pn2K1PP/7R b - -',And here White makes a speculative sacrifice.  oldgus told me he could not resist.  He clearly believed that Black would not be able to stop the avalanche of White pawns.  
26,0,26,2exd5,b'r6k/1p5p/6p1/3p4/2P1PP2/2bB4/Pn2K1PP/7R w - -',Black feels obliged to accept the sacrifice.  Was there anything better for Black?  I certainly couldn't find it.
27,0,27,Bd4,b'r6k/1p5p/6p1/3P4/3bPP2/3B4/Pn2K1PP/7R w - -',Centralizing the DSB.
28,0,28,3Bb1,b'r6k/1p5p/6p1/3P4/3bPP2/8/Pn2K1PP/1B5R b - -',Protecting a2...Oh how I wish I had taken a2 on move 18.
29,0,29,Kg8,b'2r3k1/1p5p/6p1/3P4/3bPP2/6P1/Pn2K2P/1B5R w - -',The K wakes up and decides his services could be helpful.
30,0,30,3e5,b'2r5/1p3k1p/6p1/3PP3/3b1P2/6P1/Pn2K2P/1B2R3 b - -',The ants go marching 1 by 1 hurrah! hurrah!
31,0,31,3Rc5,b'8/1p3k1p/6p1/2rPP3/3b1P2/6P1/Pn2K2P/1B2R3 w - -',"34...Rc5

The hope was 35.	d6  Bxe5   36.fxe5  Rxe5+  37. Kf2 and Black would have also been able to scoop up d6."
32,0,32,3Be4,b'8/1p3k1p/6p1/2rPP3/3bBP2/6P1/Pn2K2P/4R3 b - -',But White sees Black's plan.
33,0,33,3Na4,b'8/1p3k1p/6p1/2rPP3/n2bBP2/6P1/P3K2P/4R3 w - -',Potentially forking White's K and B
34,0,34,3Rc1,b'8/1p2k2p/4P1p1/2rP4/n3BP2/2bK2P1/P6P/2R5 b - -',Well the B is pinned for the moment as Black is certainly not interested in exchanging pieces at the moment.
35,0,35,3Ke2,b'8/1p2k2p/4P1p1/2rP4/4BP2/2b3P1/Pn2K2P/2R5 b - -',39. Ke3? would have been quite good for Black.
36,0,36,4g4,b'8/1p2k2p/4P1p1/2rP4/n3BPP1/2b5/P3K2P/2R5 b - -',The march continues.
37,0,37,b5,b'8/4k2p/4P1p1/1p1P4/n1r1BPP1/2b2K2/P6P/2R5 w - b6',Counterattack?
38,0,38,4Bxf5,b'8/4k2p/4P3/1p1P1B2/n1r3P1/2b2K2/P6P/2R5 b - -',I actually expected 43. gxf5 as that would have advanced a pawn.  Plus it looks scary to have three connected passed pawns.
39,0,39,4h6,b'8/4k3/4P2p/1p1P1B2/n1r3P1/2b2K2/P6P/2R5 w - -',Pretty well forced.
40,0,40,Nb2,b'8/4k3/4P2p/1p1P1B2/2r3P1/2b2K2/Pn5P/1R6 w - -',44...Nb2 blocks White's Rook and provides the possibility of attacking a2.
41,0,41,4h4,b'8/4k3/4P2p/1p1P1B2/r5PP/P1b2K2/1n6/1R6 b - h3',I'm really starting to hate those pawns.
42,0,42,4Rxa3,b'8/4k3/4P2p/1p1P1B2/6PP/r1b2K2/1n6/1R6 w - -',Finally 28 moves later Black gets his pawn.
43,0,43,Be5+,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1PbBP1/8/r4K2/1n6/1R6 w - -',Centralizing the Bishop with a bit of tempo.
44,0,44,Rg3+,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1PbBP1/6K1/6r1/1n6/1R6 w - -',White only has two choices.
45,0,45,Bf4,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P1BPK/5b2/6r1/1n6/1R6 w - -',Black thought he had g5.
46,0,46,5Bg4,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/5bB1/6r1/1n6/1R6 b - -',stupid Bishop.
47,0,47,5Rd3,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/5bB1/3r4/1n6/1R6 w - -',Maybe Black can grab d5.
48,0,48,5Rf1,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/5bB1/3r4/1n6/5R2 b - -',stupid Rook.
49,0,49,Nc4,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/2nr1b2/5B2/8/5R2 w - -',The N was doing no good over on b2.  It may be possible to push b5 with counterattack chances.
50,0,50,5Rd1,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/2nr1b2/5B2/8/3R4 b - -',And White decides to exchange Rs.  Black has no choice in the matter.
51,0,51,5Bb3,b'8/4k3/4P3/1p1P2PK/5b2/1B2n3/8/8 b - -',And at this point a draw was decided upon.  Neither side could see how to break through--any ideas are welcome.  Please feel free to criticize mercilessly as all comments are welcome.  My sincere thanks to oldgus as he has spent a good deal of time helping me improve my play.  My slow climb up the 1700s has been very much due to his efforts.

After an ignominious defeat against Ardin (Sonata) in which I dropped 18 rating points I was really chuffed when I got the result of Gameknot Analysis for this game.  Remarkably neither player made so much as an innaccuracy - a game with such a strong Expert and no errors - whew!  How on earth did this happen?  Well first of all read the following analysis     http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15713503&fb=1&rnd=0.48895922418947063 then read on ....

"
68,2,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bb5 - as with Coach Ion and Brigadecommander (Janet) I decided to test Dave with the Ruy Lopez.  Both Ion and Janet got the better of me so I was even more chuffed with that 14th Expert Draw!  Dave responds with a lesser known defense called The Cordel Defense.
69,2,2,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1b6/1B2p3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',7. d4 - after a pair of knights has been exchanged I now challenge the centre with d4 and I am preparing to develop my queenside.
70,2,3,dxe5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/1bp5/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',9. ...... dxe5 - I think you can guess what I am gonna do here .....
71,2,4,1Qxd8+,b'r1bQk1nr/pp3ppp/1bp5/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',10. Qxd8+ - I just can't resist it can't I?
72,2,5,1f3,b'r1bbk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P1BP2/PP4PP/RN3RK1 b kq -',12. f3 - I have nearly cleared the decks and I have now backed up my e4 pawn.  As the queens are off the board Henry will make his way back towards the centre.
73,2,6,1Kf2,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1bp2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P1BP2/PP3KPP/RN3R2 b kq -',13. Kf2 - tempted very tempted to play BxB here but the DB does not recommend it.  I think it is because it will open up the a column to the rook on a8 even though it does double up the black pawns on the b column so Henry moves towards the centre as mentioned in my previous note.  
74,2,7,1Nd2,b'r1b4r/pp2kppp/1bp2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P1BP2/PP1N1KPP/R4R2 b - -',14. Nd2 - after the BK has the same idea I cleared the decks with Nd2.
75,2,8,Kxe6,b'r6r/pp3ppp/2pnk3/4p3/4P3/2P1KP2/PP1N2PP/R2R4 w - -',18. ...... Kxe6 - both sets of bishops have been traded off and both kings are on the third rank on the e column.  I then decided to get some active play with pushing up my queenside pawns.
76,2,9,2b4,b'r2r4/p4ppp/1ppnk3/4p3/PPP1P3/4KP2/3N2PP/R2R4 b - b3',21. b4 - three little white pawnies all in a row!  Dave finds a way to puncture this arrangement however.
77,2,10,2Rxd1,b'r7/pn3ppp/1pp1k3/4p3/PPP1P3/1N2KP2/6PP/3R4 b - -',23. Rxd1 - it looks good for white a WR on the d column but now comes the puncture!
78,2,11,2cxb5,b'r7/5ppp/1p1nk3/pP2p3/P3P3/4KP2/3N2PP/3R4 b - -',26. cxb5 - I know there is a principle about take towards the centre but no way do I wish to gift Dave a passer on the a column.  Unfortunately Dave now has a file of his own for his rook the c column.  I just hope my queenside pawns do not now become sitting ducks for it. 
79,2,12,Nb7,b'8/1nr2ppp/1p2k3/pP2p3/P3P3/3K1P2/3N2PP/1R6 w - -',28. ..... nb7 - threatening Nc5+ forking Henry and the pawn on a4.

81,2,14,3Kxc2,b'8/1n4pp/1p2kp2/pP2p3/P3P3/1N3P2/2K3PP/8 b - -',32. Kxc2 - I feel a little relieved at the rook trade because my position was starting to show worrying signs of passivitis.  Although Henry has been forced back it is still very difficult for black to find a way of ingress.  Here comes the Joblock!
82,2,15,3Kc4,b'8/1n5p/1p1k1pp1/pP2p3/P1K1P3/1N3P2/6PP/8 b - -',34. Kc4 - after putting Henry into a very commanding looking position to deter Nc5 I decided to hit the offer draw button and see if Dave thought my Joblock was effective enough.  He thought it was and kindly accepted my draw offer.  I have a couple of promising looking results in my active games list at the moment.  If only I can pull off victories in those two games then I may well regain my Class A 1800+ status.  Ah well I hope you all enjoyed the Royal Wedding and this lurvely early summer weather.

261,9,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White pulls an unorthodox opening the Greek Attack Bent Larsen's pet opening (commonly called Larsen's Opening in his honor).  The idea here is to fianchetto the black-square bishop and control the center somewhat in hypermodern fashion.  Larsen himself used it to try to force an opponent who may not have seen this very much to play on his merits alone rather than knowledge of openings and I suspect my opponent may have done the same.

493,14,8,dxc5,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/1pn1p3/2P5/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This was unnecessary as it disrupts White's development in the center.  Perhaps White was hoping for a 5...bxc5 leaving the c-pawn isolated and weakening Black's queenside badly but it backfired.
494,14,9,Bxc5,b'r1bqk1nr/p2p1ppp/1pn1p3/2b5/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is absolutely the best move as it leaves Black's pawn structure intact and gets the bishop to the center quickly.  Now the advantage swings a bit to Black whose pieces are better coordinated.
495,14,10,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/p2p1ppp/1pn1p3/2b5/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This is more of a waiting move but castling is effective a good way to recover after a mistake one move before.
496,14,11,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/2b5/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This protects the center and the bishop on c5 but perhaps Black forgets that it prevents retreat for that bishop.
497,14,12,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/2b5/2B1P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',This move is good for both sides as it invites 7...Bxc3 which helps White by removing Black's strong bishop from the board and helps Black by removing a bishop which is stranded in the middle of the board (if it were captured recapturing with the d-pawn allows uncomfortable space toward the center and recapturing with the b-pawn is asking for a queenside attack.
498,14,13,Bxe3,b'r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/8/2B1P3/4bN2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Simple and it benefits White by doubling pawns on the e-file assuming a recapture by the f-pawn.
499,14,14,fxe3,b'r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/8/2B1P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',The only sensible move here.
500,14,15,Bb7,b'r2qk1nr/pb3ppp/1pnpp3/8/2B1P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Evidently Black is angling for a discovered attack on White's unprotected pawn on e4.
501,14,16,Bb5,b'r2qk1nr/pb3ppp/1pnpp3/1B6/4P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',This takes that plan away with a pin on the king.
502,14,17,a6,b'r2qk1nr/1b3ppp/ppnpp3/1B6/4P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',"Forcing the bishop to do something - in other words ""s*** or get off the pot."""
503,14,18,1Bxc6+,b'r2qk1nr/1b3ppp/ppBpp3/8/4P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White's been attacking all game and his game plan depends on maintaining this momentum.
504,14,19,1Bxc6,b'r2qk1nr/5ppp/ppbpp3/8/4P3/4PN2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black has the advantage at this point.  He has given up a knight and a bishop but has both of White's bishops and he has a hedgehog formation set up.  Plus he avoids the clogging up that this position usually entails as his Queen has a path out of the back.  White meanwhile has castled but has doubled pawns on the e-file and the kingside is weak.
505,14,20,1Nc3,b'r2qk1nr/5ppp/ppbpp3/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Good development here as White needs to get going on his game plan.
506,14,21,1Qd7,b'r3k1nr/3q1ppp/ppbpp3/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Keeping in tune with Black's generally defensive strategy despite the Sicilian opening.
507,14,22,1Qd4,b'r3k1nr/3q1ppp/ppbpp3/8/3QP3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',White brings the Queen out; he's ready for a brawl.
508,14,23,1f6,b'r3k1nr/3q2pp/ppbppp2/8/3QP3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black's strategy is interesting as he extends the hedgehog.  This move is calculated to avoid the Queen taking the g-pawn and taking the rook but it provides an interesting vanguard of pawns.
509,14,24,1Qxb6,b'r3k1nr/3q2pp/pQbppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',White sees an undefended pawn and takes it gaining an inroads into a suddenly weak-looking queenside.
510,14,25,1Qb7,b'r3k1nr/1q4pp/pQbppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black seeing White's queen advancing far into his formation and threatening to blow it up decides to fix it now and trade queens.
511,14,26,1Qxb7,b'r3k1nr/1Q4pp/p1bppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',White accepts.
512,14,27,1Bxb7,b'r3k1nr/1b4pp/p2ppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',And Black finishes the job.
513,14,28,1Rad1,b'r3k1nr/1b4pp/p2ppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b kq -',White still aggressive moves his rook out trying to get at Black's pawns.
514,14,29,1O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/1b4pp/p2ppp2/8/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black defends his d-pawn while getting his rook into the game.  A good move although the knight and rook stuck in the corner are a bit concerning.
515,14,30,1Nd4,b'2kr2nr/1b4pp/p2ppp2/8/3NP3/2N1P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White sees another undefended pawn and attacks it.
516,14,31,1e5,b'2kr2nr/1b4pp/p2p1p2/4p3/3NP3/2N1P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black eliminates the pawn and attacks the knight building a pawn wedge in the middle of the board.
517,14,32,1Ne6,b'2kr2nr/1b4pp/p2pNp2/4p3/4P3/2N1P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Still kicking with the knight White moves to attack the rook; his aggression is beginning to come at the expense of development.
518,14,33,1Rd7,b'2k3nr/1b1r2pp/p2pNp2/4p3/4P3/2N1P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black moves his rook out of the line of fire and defends the g-pawn which is also attacked by the knight.
519,14,34,1Na4,b'2k3nr/1b1r2pp/p2pNp2/4p3/N3P3/4P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White moves to set up a check involving both of his knights.
520,14,35,1Re7,b'2k3nr/1b2r1pp/p2pNp2/4p3/N3P3/4P3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',While White's messing around with his knights isn't getting much done Black's move to attack the knight rather than develop his knight or other rook isn't all that much better.
521,14,36,1Rxd6,b'2k3nr/1b2r1pp/p2RNp2/4p3/N3P3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',White takes the undefended pawn; his attack has suddenly become potent and serious.
522,14,37,1Bxe4,b'2k3nr/4r1pp/p2RNp2/4p3/N3b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',This move is not particularly fantastic but it does get rid of a White pawn while maintaining a presence on the a8-h1 diagonal; Nh6 would be still better to get some protection on the eighth rank.
523,14,38,2Nb6+,b'2k3nr/4r1pp/pN1RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',One of two safe check options (the other being Rd8+) this one is on the whole better as it involves three of White's pieces and has possibilities written all over it.
524,14,39,2Kb8,b'1k4nr/4r1pp/pN1RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',One of White's only two legal moves and it is probably better than coming to the seventh rank in the long term.
525,14,40,2Nd7+,b'1k4nr/3Nr1pp/p2RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',More checks.
526,14,41,2Kc8,b'2k3nr/3Nr1pp/p2RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Black wants to force White to move the knight again.
527,14,42,2Nb6+,b'2k3nr/4r1pp/pN1RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',White delivers check again.
528,14,43,2Kb8,b'1k4nr/4r1pp/pN1RNp2/4p3/4b3/4P3/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Black is thinking about a draw by repetition.
529,14,44,2c3,b'1k4nr/4r1pp/pN1RNp2/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Solely to avoid the draw.  White thinks he has this game won.
530,14,45,2Nh6,b'1k5r/4r1pp/pN1RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black finally sees the light and gets his rook involved.  His knight is also out and ready to get involved.
531,14,46,2Nd7+,b'1k5r/3Nr1pp/p2RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',White makes a bad decision here.  He is reluctant to exchange rooks because that would emasculate his current attack and he is enamored of it unwilling to regroup bring out his second rook or God forbid develop a few pawns.
532,14,47,2Kc8,b'2k4r/3Nr1pp/p2RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Same reasoning here.
533,14,48,2Nb6+,b'2k4r/4r1pp/pN1RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',White continues to check.
534,14,49,2Kb8,b'1k5r/4r1pp/pN1RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black is once again willing to take the threefold draw.
535,14,50,2Nd5,b'1k5r/4r1pp/p2RNp1n/3Np3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',White finally pulls back although this looks to continue the same general attack of the past few moves.
536,14,51,2Rhe8,b'1k2r3/4r1pp/p2RNp1n/3Np3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black blunders away his rook trying to take a knight.
537,14,52,2Nxe7,b'1k2r3/4N1pp/p2RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',White takes the opportunity he gets.
538,14,53,2Rxe7,b'1k6/4r1pp/p2RNp1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black must of course take the knight.
539,14,54,2Rxa6,b'1k6/4r1pp/R3Np1n/4p3/4b3/2P1P3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',White might as well wreak havoc here.
540,14,55,2Bd3,b'1k6/4r1pp/R3Np1n/4p3/8/2PbP3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black forks the two rooks on the same diagonal.  A good move here though moving the knight into the fray would not be a bad idea as well.
541,14,56,2Rd1,b'1k6/4r1pp/R3Np1n/4p3/8/2PbP3/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - -',"White misses the fork here: Rb6+ could force the King to move and save both rooks.  This would get a ""??"" as it absolutely loses the rook."
542,14,57,2Bxa6,b'1k6/4r1pp/b3Np1n/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/3R2K1 w - -',And who is Black to give up a free rook?
543,14,58,3Rd8+,b'1k1R4/4r1pp/b3Np1n/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',White who will not be happy to have lost his rook might as well check though he needs to get his pawns moving.
544,14,59,3Bc8,b'1kbR4/4r1pp/4Np1n/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 w - -',Not necessarily the best move as Kb7 might have been better but this one isn't too bad given that it appears to be setting up for a Kb7 at some point.
545,14,60,3Nf8,b'1kbR1N2/4r1pp/5p1n/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',An attempt to take material rather than build an attack.
546,14,61,3Nf7,b'1kbR1N2/4rnpp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 w - -',Black is now defending well note the coordination among his pieces even though he is playing complete defense at the moment.
547,14,62,3Nd7+,b'1kbR4/3Nrnpp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',"A weak check meant to keep the attack going but gaining a ""?""."
548,14,63,3Rxd7,b'1kbR4/3r1npp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 w - -',Black is perfectly willing to not only take the knight but trade rooks if White wants to as he can then exploit his material advantage and mow down White's undeveloped pawns.
549,14,64,3Rg8,b'1kb3R1/3r1npp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',Still trying to gain material rather than get out and regroup.
550,14,65,3Rd1+,b'1kb3R1/5npp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/3r2K1 w - -',Amazingly Black's first check of the match.  There isn't much behind it but Black is trying to turn the game toward his own attack.
551,14,66,3Kf2,b'1kb3R1/5npp/5p2/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP3KPP/3r4 b - -',Forced.
552,14,67,3g6,b'1kb3R1/5n1p/5pp1/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP3KPP/3r4 w - -',Black is not yet ready to start picking off pawns and chooses to protect his own.
553,14,68,3Rg7,b'1kb5/5nRp/5pp1/4p3/8/2P1P3/PP3KPP/3r4 b - -',A good move under the circumstances; Black wins a pawn.
554,14,69,3Ng5,b'1kb5/6Rp/5pp1/4p1n1/8/2P1P3/PP3KPP/3r4 w - -',This gets the knight out of harm's way but also gets an attack going.
555,14,70,3Ke2,b'1kb5/6Rp/5pp1/4p1n1/8/2P1P3/PP2K1PP/3r4 b - -',White is tired of having Black's rook in the way and moves to get it out.
556,14,71,3Rd7,b'1kb5/3r2Rp/5pp1/4p1n1/8/2P1P3/PP2K1PP/8 w - -',Black offers a rook trade and protects his h-pawn.
557,14,72,3Rg8,b'1kb3R1/3r3p/5pp1/4p1n1/8/2P1P3/PP2K1PP/8 b - -',White knows enough not to give up his last piece and while still in deep trouble looks to finally have some idea of what to do.
558,14,73,3Kc7,b'2b3R1/2kr3p/5pp1/4p1n1/8/2P1P3/PP2K1PP/8 w - -',A good move by Black; it allows the bishop a way out protects the bishop and begins to get the King into the game.
559,14,74,3h4,b'2b3R1/2kr3p/5pp1/4p1n1/7P/2P1P3/PP2K1P1/8 b - h3',Moving his pawns (finally) though apparently more to attack the knight.
560,14,75,3Ba6+,b'6R1/2kr3p/b4pp1/4p1n1/7P/2P1P3/PP2K1P1/8 w - -',A nice intermezzo finally getting the bishop off the back rank.
561,14,76,3Ke1,b'6R1/2kr3p/b4pp1/4p1n1/7P/2P1P3/PP4P1/4K3 b - -',Simply moving out of check though Kf2 might have been better.
562,14,77,3Ne4,b'6R1/2kr3p/b4pp1/4p3/4n2P/2P1P3/PP4P1/4K3 w - -',No safe check here so Black moves the knight out of danger while still threatening.
563,14,78,4Ra8,b'R7/2kr3p/b4pp1/4p3/4n2P/2P1P3/PP4P1/4K3 b - -',Attacks the bishop no more or less.
564,14,79,4Bc4,b'R7/2kr3p/5pp1/4p3/2b1n2P/2P1P3/PP4P1/4K3 w - -',The bishop may as well get closer to the action.
565,14,80,4b3,b'R7/2kr3p/5pp1/4p3/2b1n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 b - -',"Done to attack the bishop rather than out of any genuine desire to get the pawns involved. Apparently he has not heard Philidor's ""pawns are the soul of chess"" (Black though he is down two pawns and has only moved one pawn since move 16 has incorporated them much more into his game and is getting more mileage out of them)."
566,14,81,4Bd5,b'R7/2kr3p/5pp1/3bp3/4n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 w - -',Black has to get the bishop out of the way of course and also attacks the rook.
567,14,82,4Ra7+,b'8/R1kr3p/5pp1/3bp3/4n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 b - -',White has little choice.
568,14,83,4Kc6,b'8/R2r3p/2k2pp1/3bp3/4n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 w - -',No more using the bishop to block the rook's check Black is ready to exchange.
569,14,84,4Ra6+,b'8/3r3p/R1k2pp1/3bp3/4n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 b - -',But White refuses to exchange and keeps chasing.

571,14,86,4Ra4,b'8/3r3p/5pp1/1k1bp3/R3n2P/1PP1P3/P5P1/4K3 b - -',He retreats instead.
572,14,87,4Nxc3,b'8/3r3p/5pp1/1k1bp3/R6P/1Pn1P3/P5P1/4K3 w - -',A good move attacking the rook while limiting the King's scope of movement.
573,14,88,4Rg4,b'8/3r3p/5pp1/1k1bp3/6RP/1Pn1P3/P5P1/4K3 b - -',Again White is forced to get the rook out of there.
574,14,89,4f5,b'8/3r3p/6p1/1k1bpp2/6RP/1Pn1P3/P5P1/4K3 w - -',This attacks the rook and builds a nice pawn chain as Black continues to develop his position and force the rook to move for the fifth time in a row.
575,14,90,4a4+,b'8/3r3p/6p1/1k1bpp2/P5RP/1Pn1P3/6P1/4K3 b - a3',A simple check compounded by White's inability to move the the b4 square which would normally be ideal.

578,14,93,4Ka5,b'8/3r3p/6p1/k2bpp2/P5RP/4P3/6P1/4K3 w - -',He doesn't have much choice though the block of the pawn is well chosen - it keeps the King relevant (though out of the way of his own pieces) and avoids any promotion scares.
579,14,94,4Rg3,b'8/3r3p/6p1/k2bpp2/P6P/4P1R1/6P1/4K3 b - -',White doesn't have many good moves and needs to get his rook out of danger; he has no safe moves on the fourth rank and moving it to g5 traps it.  The pawn on h4 becomes a liability as it prevents the rook from getting at Black's pawn on h2 and attacking the pawn chain.
580,14,95,4Bb3,b'8/3r3p/6p1/k3pp2/P6P/1b2P1R1/6P1/4K3 w - -',Though Black could easily move Kxa4 here the pawn is not dangerous and he has bigger plans setting up with this movement of his bishop to set up a back-rank check.
581,14,96,4h5,b'8/3r3p/6p1/k3pp1P/P7/1b2P1R1/6P1/4K3 b - -',The pawn chain which Black has lovingly maintained is dominating the board and limiting White's ability to operate on the kingside which allows White to congregate his superior forces and infiltrate on the other side of the board.  It has got to go.
582,14,97,4gxh5,b'8/3r3p/8/k3pp1p/P7/1b2P1R1/6P1/4K3 w - -',Black obliges though he won't be the first to lose a pawn.  It was inevitable anyway.
583,14,98,5Rg5,b'8/3r3p/8/k3ppRp/P7/1b2P3/6P1/4K3 b - -',Now White moves his rook to the fifth rank attempting to pick off the pawns one by one; he still has some hopes of winning or at least drawing the match.
584,14,99,5Bxa4,b'8/3r3p/8/k3ppRp/b7/4P3/6P1/4K3 w - -',Black will lose a pawn in the course of the turn and figures he might as well finally take that a-pawn.
585,14,100,5Rxf5,b'8/3r3p/8/k3pR1p/b7/4P3/6P1/4K3 b - -',Nothing unexpected.
586,14,101,5Rd1+,b'8/7p/8/k3pR1p/b7/4P3/6P1/3rK3 w - -',Not bad but there are other good moves (Re7 defending two of his remaining pawns or Rg7 attacking Black's weak g-pawn).  He appears to be ready to harass the White King.
587,14,102,5Ke2,b'8/7p/8/k3pR1p/b7/4P3/4K1P1/3r4 b - -',Of the two legal moves probably the better keeping the rook in range.
588,14,103,5Rd5,b'8/7p/8/k2rpR1p/b7/4P3/4K1P1/8 w - -',Now Black wants to defend his e-pawn and protect his King.

590,14,105,5Bb5+,b'8/7p/8/kb1rp2R/8/4P3/4K1P1/8 w - -',Increasingly weaker checks though Black is evidently trying to drive the King towards the kingside.
591,14,106,5Kf2,b'8/7p/8/kb1rp2R/8/4P3/5KP1/8 b - -',Arguably not the best move; Ke1 may be better here.
592,14,107,5Rd2+,b'8/7p/8/kb2p2R/8/4P3/3r1KP1/8 w - -',Another check trying to move the King away from his pawns and get the pawns off the board.
593,14,108,5Kg3,b'8/7p/8/kb2p2R/8/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 b - -',White finally decides to give up on the first rank.
594,14,109,5e4,b'8/7p/8/kb5R/4p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 w - -',Black blocks the movement of the e-pawn and sets up the e-pawns as the spot for the showdown at the end of the match.
595,14,110,5Rxh7,b'8/7R/8/kb6/4p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 b - -',I don't quite like this move.  The h-pawn is by now basically a nonentity and should play no role in the game.  I prefer 56. Kf4 Rxg2 57. Kxe4 with some parity.  At this point Black will be forced to either lose his h-pawn anyway or fanatically protect it and the bishop will likely be sacrificed at some point to prevent promotion of White's e-pawn leaving king and rook on both sides.  Not well done here.  White botches a strong comebakc.
596,14,111,5Ka4,b'8/7R/8/1b6/k3p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 w - -',Black getting let off the hook begins to move his King where it needs to go.  Should White attack e4 now the bishop can merely slide to c6.
597,14,112,5Re7,b'8/4R3/8/1b6/k3p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 b - -',Of course White does attack winning some points for getting his rook involved.
598,14,113,5Bc6,b'8/4R3/2b5/8/k3p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 w - -',Black faithfully moves his bishop over avoiding a move to d3 so as to prevent a pin to the rook on the d-file.
599,14,114,5Ra7+,b'8/R7/2b5/8/k3p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 b - -',"Another bad move earning a ""?"" for missing the opportunity of Kf4 winning the e-file and e-pawn for White and giving up only its moribund g-pawn in the process.  Instead a cheap check."
600,14,115,5Kb5,b'8/R7/2b5/1k6/4p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 w - -',Black will protect his bishop as long as the King's moving.
601,14,116,5Rh7,b'8/7R/2b5/1k6/4p3/4P1K1/3r2P1/8 b - -',White is gearing up either for a move onto the fifth rank which seems more likely or is moving around the whole fray to the first rank.
602,14,117,5Re2,b'8/7R/2b5/1k6/4p3/4P1K1/4r1P1/8 w - -',Black breaks the standoff by forcing some action attacking the e-pawn and resolving to win either the e- or g-pawn in the process.
603,14,118,6Rh5+,b'8/8/2b5/1k5R/4p3/4P1K1/4r1P1/8 b - -',Another check but one which allows White's rook to come into the fray.  Better.
604,14,119,6Kc4,b'8/8/2b5/7R/2k1p3/4P1K1/4r1P1/8 w - -',Black's King on the retreat seeks to get involved in the upcoming battle over the e-file.
605,14,120,6Rh6,b'8/8/2b4R/8/2k1p3/4P1K1/4r1P1/8 b - -',An attack on the bishop which although it forestalls action about which pawn to save by White gets Black's bishop moving.
606,14,121,6Bd5,b'8/8/7R/3b4/2k1p3/4P1K1/4r1P1/8 w - -',The bishop might as well clog things up too.
607,14,122,6Kf4,b'8/8/7R/3b4/2k1pK2/4P3/4r1P1/8 b - -',There are no more checks or cheap attacks on the bishop.  White chooses (correctly) the e-pawn over the g-pawn.
608,14,123,6Kd3,b'8/8/7R/3b4/4pK2/3kP3/4r1P1/8 w - -',"This is a calculated ""error."" While it opens the door for 63. Rd6 pinning the bishop to the King Black can safely take the e-pawn at that point and be in effect a pawn ahead if we do not count the irrelevant g-pawn."
609,14,124,6Rh3,b'8/8/8/3b4/4pK2/3kP2R/4r1P1/8 b - -',This move is made to protect the g-pawn from the previous scenario.
610,14,125,6Rxg2,b'8/8/8/3b4/4pK2/3kP2R/6r1/8 w - -',Seeing that plan thwarted Black takes the g-pawn; the next logical step for White is to involve that piece and Black would rather not see that happen.
611,14,126,6Ke5,b'8/8/8/3bK3/4p3/3kP2R/6r1/8 b - -',A good check this threatens to rid Black of his bishop the foundation of his formation.
612,14,127,6Rg5+,b'8/8/8/3bK1r1/4p3/3kP2R/8/8 w - -',A well-done check this protects the bishop at the same time.
613,14,128,6Kf4,b'8/8/8/3b2r1/4pK2/3kP2R/8/8 b - -',This is a type of zugzwang with none of Black's three legal moves being very savory.  Kd6 or Kf6 attack Black pieces but leave the King no opportunity to get back to the battle over the e-pawns.  This one saves the e-pawn but does not give the King much chance to capture any of the pieces.
614,14,129,6Rg1,b'8/8/8/3b4/4pK2/3kP2R/8/6r1 w - -',With no great move coming for the rook this one gets it out of trouble and allows it to regroup.
615,14,130,6Ke5,b'8/8/8/3bK3/4p3/3kP2R/8/6r1 b - -',Trying the same thing over again White may now be the one thinking about threefold repetition.
616,14,131,6Bb3,b'8/8/8/4K3/4p3/1b1kP2R/8/6r1 w - -',Black who has the clear upper hand and whose King protects it e-pawn will have no part of it.
617,14,132,6Rh4,b'8/8/8/4K3/4p2R/1b1kP3/8/6r1 b - -',A simple assault on Black's pawn.
618,14,133,6Rg5+,b'8/8/8/4K1r1/4p2R/1b1kP3/8/8 w - -',One of the only good moves Black has.  He will force the King to move either to Kf4 preventing a capture on his own pawn or a move to the sixth rank not allowing the King to attack Black's pawn and allowing Black to take White's pawn and not worry about king-bishop-rook vs. king-rook endgame just yet which would occur on 67...Kxe3 68. Rxe4+.  (I may confess that I as White had the luxury of knowing that my endgame play in that sort of situation is not great.)
619,14,134,6Kf4,b'8/8/8/6r1/4pK1R/1b1kP3/8/8 b - -',The only move to keep him in the fight.
620,14,135,6Ra5,b'8/8/8/r7/4pK1R/1b1kP3/8/8 w - -',Once again getting the rook out of the way.
621,14,136,6Rh8,b'7R/8/8/r7/4pK2/1b1kP3/8/8 b - -',Possibly to try to check the King along the d-file.
622,14,137,6Ra3,b'7R/8/8/8/4pK2/rb1kP3/8/8 w - -',Intended to protect the bishop in case of an attack on the b-file.
623,14,138,7Rd8+,b'3R4/8/8/8/4pK2/rb1kP3/8/8 b - -',The check comes and it works.
624,14,139,7Ke2,b'3R4/8/8/8/4pK2/rb2P3/4k3/8 w - -',Black has to do this.
625,14,140,7Kxe4,b'3R4/8/8/8/4K3/rb2P3/4k3/8 b - -',Finally! (If you hadn't noticed yet Black's game had become more about protecting his own pawn than taking White's.)
626,14,141,7Bc2+,b'3R4/8/8/8/4K3/r3P3/2b1k3/8 w - -',A simple check opportunity intended to start driving the King away from his pawn.
627,14,142,7Kd4,b'3R4/8/8/8/3K4/r3P3/2b1k3/8 b - -',A bad move it allows for Rd3+ winning White's rook.  However that still leaves the tricky matter of the e-pawn and the exchange probably would have transpired thus: 72...Rd3+ 73. Ke5 Rxd1 74. e4 Bxe4 75. Kxe4.  Given that this was a blitz game which rarely if ever include resignations this would have required me to play out a king-rook vs. king endgame which I have messed up before (see my rating) and I was not eager to relive.  Instead I chose the other alternative.
628,14,143,7Rxe3,b'3R4/8/8/8/3K4/4r3/2b1k3/8 w - -',Here is an opportunity to see if my opponent makes one more mistake or if I can outmaneuver him.
629,14,144,7Rc8,b'2R5/8/8/8/3K4/4r3/2b1k3/8 b - -',A simple cheap move to force Black to do something.
630,14,145,7Rd3+,b'2R5/8/8/8/3K4/3r4/2b1k3/8 w - -',And Black did something.  White's King has four moves only one of which will not lead to the loss of his rook (Ke5).
631,14,146,7Ke4,b'2R5/8/8/8/4K3/3r4/2b1k3/8 b - -',Unfortunately White makes one final mistake and it's over.
632,14,147,7Rc3+,b'2R5/8/8/8/4K3/2r5/2b1k3/8 w - -',Yeah...
633,14,148,7Kd4,b'2R5/8/8/8/3K4/2r5/2b1k3/8 b - -',And White resigned here.  Overall White got an early jump but the tide turned for two reasons: White's unwillingness to come back and stop the obsessive attacks and the difference in the use of pawns.  Whit got doubled pawns early and after this eschewed the use of pawns until it was too late and even then as attack pieces rather than for development and positional purposes.  Black meanwhile quietly built good pawn structure and made his pawns the center of his game and this eventually gave him a win.

650,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I generally go with 1.e4 it's just a personal preference.  Lately my game's been undergoing a transition and this allows me to build a nice pawn chain or stonewall which I find works well for me.  All sorts of possibilities with this one a simple book move.
651,16,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Nothing strange here.
652,16,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I often like to play Scotch Game as it leads to some sort of a brawl and this is setting up for that.  This can also lead to a Philidor Defense which I like playing as both White or Black.  (This may explain my firm patzer status.)  Anyway simple enough here.
653,16,3,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This one seems to be an effort by Black to keep play out of the center and it's not a particularly good move.  I had not seen Damiano played for a long time and no wonder - I hesitate to call it bad but it gives White advantage.
654,16,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is a common and strong response Horowitz suggests a line with 3. Bc4 that leads to strong White advantage.  3. Nxe5! is considered a better move but I figured here that if Black wanted a quiet defensive game I'd give it to him and develop my defense while I was at it.
655,16,5,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn1pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This seems to be a move for the sake of movement.  I cannot find much defense for it.  True it does take the knight out of the bishop's line of attack but there is no reason to take the knight at that point.  It also protects the king but the king is still in a relatively secure position and this doesn't bolster kingside defense terribly well.  In addition it stifles the queen and black-square bishop.  Not terribly good.
656,16,6,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn1pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The beginning of a pawn formation.  In addition it opens up movement for White's black-squared bishop.  It also offers some defense for the bishop and asserts some control over the center.  Perhaps a little stifling but not bad.
657,16,7,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Not the worst move here.  Allows the white-squared bishop to get out and gives the queen a bit of breathing room.  Probably better than 4...d5 which could lead to white control of the center or the queen being exposed early.
658,16,8,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Developing.  It puts the bishop in the center of the board and begins to set up for queenside castling if so desired.
659,16,9,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This is aggressive move.  It pins the knight to the queen and (finally) develops a piece past the second rank.  This can be easily countered but not intrinsically bad.
660,16,10,Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This is more development entrenching White's defense of the center and giving it a strong claim the the d5 square.  This move could have been used to threaten the bishop of g4 but not bad here.
661,16,11,a6,b'rn1qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p2p1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',This one is purely to set up for 7...b5 attacking the bishop.
662,16,12,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p2p1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Here possibly a move late but there at any rate is the attack on the bishop forcing it to retreat and leaving White's center intact (or to trade the bishop for the knight).
663,16,13,Nbc6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1np1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Not a bad development.  This begins to set up for an attack on the center or the queenside although any attack is rather far off.
664,16,14,Nd5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1np1p2/3Np3/2B1P1b1/3PBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This one is a threatening move more than anything.  White is inviting Black to trade knights which would put White's bishop at d5 and given that no threats are forthcoming give it domination over the board.  If such a trade is rejected this cramps Black's style (not to mention his position) in the middle of the board with the c7 e7 and f6 squares all attacked.
665,16,15,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1np1p2/3Np3/2B1P3/3PBb1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"Black comes back to his threatened bishop and decides to exchange it.  I might give this move as ""Bxf3?"" because with White's pawn at e4 and bishop at c4 (and possibly moving to d5 soon) White controls many of the white squares and the loss of his white-square bishop gives Black a disadvantage particularly as the scope of the knight he captured was limited by Black's decent pawn wedge and it was not defending any major square or piece."
666,16,16,Qxf3,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1np1p2/3Np3/2B1P3/3PBQ1P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',This is basically forced though the queen capture is rather better than capturing with the g-pawn.  A capture with the g-pawn is rather questionable as it doubles pawns on the f-file  leaves the g-file quite vulnerable and accomplishes little (g4 is already defended by the h-pawn and could be bolstered much better by moving the g-pawn there).  This move does move the queen out but to a relatively safe spot devoid of much serious threat from Black.
667,16,17,h6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1p1/p1np1p1p/3Np3/2B1P3/3PBQ1P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Setting up for an attack on the queen and generally kingside.  Black is probably preparing for 10...g5  though this pawn formation is somewhat problematic as it traps Black's remaining bishop away from the action.  In addition the move allows a direct checkmate which Black if he is committed to the g5 move should defend against first.
668,16,18,1g4,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n1p1/p1np1p1p/3Np3/2B1P1P1/3PBQ1P/PPP2P2/R3K2R b KQkq g3',Perhaps not the best move as it does limit the scope of the Queen but not bad.  It counter's Black's impending stonewall and constructs one of White's own.
669,16,19,1g5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n3/p1np1p1p/3Np1p1/2B1P1P1/3PBQ1P/PPP2P2/R3K2R w KQkq g6',Of course Black has a one-track mind here.  He presses on with his stonewall formation which is actually not terrible in and of itself.  However Black has neglected to move his bishop out which basically traps it.  In addition the placement of the knight on e7 and the previous placement of the pawn on g7 has kept the bishop and queen in their original positions and blocks them in which leaves the f6 pawn undefended and opens up to the next move.  Disaster.  A terrible blunder literally the worst possible move on the board since it leads to...
670,16,20,1Nxf6#,b'r2qkb1r/1pp1n3/p1np1N1p/4p1p1/2B1P1P1/3PBQ1P/PPP2P2/R3K2R b KQkq -',"Nxf6#.  I did not believe I was actually watching this when I saw 10...g5?? played.  Had this been over an actual board I think it likely that ""nicendnaughty"" (the actual username of the player I had been playing blitz with on a different site) would have let his naughty side out and flipped the board over.  I had not played badly up to this point and felt I had a decent position but of course here was a chance to checkmate.  Much as I like a good game of chess the object is winning and I am not one to pass up a mate-in-one opportunity should I see.  (Often I don't see it until later - this is blitz after all but I don't have a 1052 rating on that site for nothing.)  Have a good laugh at this one."
671,17,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',I started this game off with my normal plan: use the Grand Prix to gain an extrodinary attack. However I noticed the high rating of my oppenent and was somewhat worried.  In this game you will see a successful attack pulled off by originally reckless moves. I try extremely hard to end a game I thought I couldn't win.
672,17,1,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So it isn't exactly going the way I want it to. He hasn't tried to fiancheto his Bishop and hasn't given me chances at the elegant attack I want.

Saya kurang paham keuntungan langkah ini dari perspektif hitam (apakah sekedar mencegah petak pusat didominasi putih?). Tapi yang pasti langkah ini secara otomatis menimbulkan petak lemah di d5. Mengapa lemah? Petak ini tidak bisa dijaga oleh pion sehingga apabila putih meletakkan perwira di d5 mereka hanya bisa diusi oleh perwira-perwira hitam.

761,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I started normally expecting another boring beginning.
762,20,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',His move was very different to any I had expected so I was getting ready for a fun and intersting game!
763,20,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',As we are usually taaught I took the oppurtunity to take control of the center of the board.
764,20,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',He challenged me to a pawn swap but I didn't really want to let him get his queen out there so quickly. Now I had to think of a way to avoid this happening.
765,20,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I ended up doing this which proved to be very helpful for later. At that moment I was thinking that by doing that I had managed to prevent urgo from getting his knight easily to f6.
766,20,5,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now urgo was trying to advance his bishop I decided that wanted to castle  on the queen's side so I was deciding on either advancing my knight or bishop.
767,20,6,Be3,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Obviously I chose bishop as I didn't want his bishop pinning my knight if I were to move it to c3 and I didn't want to move my knight to d2 as that would trap my bishop.
768,20,7,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I guess urgo was simply advancing his pieces to get himself into a good position.
769,20,8,Nf3,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I decided that I may aswell advance my knight to give me more power around the center of the board.
770,20,9,f6,b'r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',When he did that realised he wanted me to take his pawn so that he would be able to advance his knight.
771,20,10,Bf4,b'r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',To avoid taking his pawn I developed the pawn's protection by adding a bishop which would be quite useful in the exchange.

995,27,0,Bxc3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/2P1p3/2b3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black wants to keep White from ganging up on the weakling at e5 with Nc3 Bg2 and Qc2 so this exchange giving up the Bishop-pair is almost mandatory lest Black bolt right out of the starting gate into a defensive and mostly passive box.
996,27,1,Bg4,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/2PPp1b1/2P3P1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',A puzzlingly one-dimensional move since the Bishop is doing nothing but inhibiting White's King-pawn from stepping forward and not even in any significant way. Better was 10. ...Be6 to force White to make a decision in the center.

The problem is that to do so he has to expose his King somewhat and he needs his Bishop in that immediate neighborhood to help support his counterattack ...both of which factors White will soon exploit to his advantage.
1001,27,6,1e3,b'1r2r3/ppp2ppk/2p2q2/5b1p/2PPp2P/2P1P1P1/PQ3PB1/3R1RK1 b - -',Making it hard for the Rook on e8 to enter the game via e6 and then along the 6th rank after the pawn-push to d5.

1143,33,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',2. Nf3 is something that is seen in almost every 1. e4 opening. It is the penutbutter to the jelly that is 1. e4.
1144,33,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"2... Nc6 is the best option or at least for me. I once knew the Pitroff with the ability that I know the Sicillian today but I haven't employed it since I became more serious in my studies of chess. That is another reason this game turned out with a strange position because my studies are mostly for 1... c5 rather than 1... e5. I wish to one day know how to play almost every opening with the skill of a master and a few with the skill of a Grand Master. Of course that will be many years away. ""An amateur practices until he gets it right; a master practices until he never gets it wrong."" Sounds like many years to me."
1145,33,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',He decides to play 3. Bc4. 3. Bc4 is still one of the best moves. You will see it from begining level to masters. I used it towards my early years of chess but have lately been quite fond of the Schotch Gambit (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Bc4 ....). Even though in the Schotch Gambit it is just a move later that Bc4 is played attacking oppertunities are far greater.
1146,33,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I play here inviting the upcoming move of 4. Ng5. The Fried Liver is a move played by many club players and begining tournament players. It is probably played at higher levels but probably less frequently.
1147,33,6,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I have seen this in countless games before this and probably countless after this and that is one reason why I learned the Sicillian. This move happens too often and usually leads to some dull play. However this game is quite fun and sharp.
1148,33,7,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',The best move I believe. Or so I think...
1149,33,8,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',He takes the pawn so now I have the choice of taking it back and getting into a highly tactical game (5... Nxd5 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+ with sharp play to follow) or playing my Knight over to the rim losing the pawn but pulling off a nice gambit-type move (5... Na5 6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Qf3 keeping his extra pawn).
1150,33,9,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/n2Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I decide to go with the less tactical game. I was more familiar with playing Black from this standpoint anyways. As White I am more familiar with the Nxd5 line.
1151,33,10,Bb5+,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/nB1Pp1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',As I previously stated this line allows him to keep his pawn.
1152,33,11,c6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/nB1Pp1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It is only natural to block a check.  6... Bd7 may have been better but I am not completly sure...
1153,33,12,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2P2n2/nB2p1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Moving the Bishop away simply allows Black to regain the pawn.
1154,33,13,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/nB2p1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I'm not going to let him get up two pawns now am I?
1155,33,14,Qf3,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/nB2p1N1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This makes it not possible to take the Bishop. (8... cxb5? loses to 9. Qxa8)
1156,33,15,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/nB2p1N1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I want to be able to castle soon. This move does give up a second pawn though.
1157,33,16,Bxc6+,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2B2n2/n3p1N1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',He seizes up the pawn willing to exchange the Bishop for my Knight.
1158,33,17,Nxc6,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',A bad Knight for a good Bishop sounds good right? Too bad I lost a pawn to it though...
1159,33,18,1Qxc6+,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2Q2n2/4p1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',The only good move here. Leaving the Knight would be almost idiotic.
1160,33,19,1Bd7,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2Q2n2/4p1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Any other move gives up the Rook.
1161,33,20,1Qc4,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/5n2/4p1N1/2Q5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Threatening Qxf7#. Black must choose the correct moves.
1162,33,21,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/5n2/4p1N1/2Q5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Any other move hurts Black furthermore.
1163,33,22,1Nc3,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/5n2/4p1N1/2Q5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I wouldn't call it a blunder but not the best move (I think). It allows me to reposition my pieces and force him to move his Queen off the nice c4 square.
1164,33,23,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbppp/5n2/4p1N1/2Q5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This move gets my Rook active and forces him to move his Queen.
1165,33,24,1Qe2,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbppp/5n2/4p1N1/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I would say that this move was not his best. It will later haunt him.
1166,33,25,1h6,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbpp1/5n1p/4p1N1/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I want his Knight out of my territory. This also creates an escape square for my King.
1167,33,26,1Nf3,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbpp1/5n1p/4p3/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',14. Nge4 may have been better but I am not entirely sure... I would have played that if only to trade down pieces to further show my advantage in material.
1168,33,27,1e4,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbpp1/5n1p/8/4p3/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I try to create some counter-play for myself.
1169,33,28,1Ne5,b'2rq1rk1/p2bbpp1/5n1p/4N3/4p3/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',15. Nxe4 gives Black the chance to snatch up the c2 pawn with 15... Rxc2
1170,33,29,1Be6,b'2rq1rk1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/4N3/4p3/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I want to keep my Bishop pair.
1171,33,30,1f4,b'2rq1rk1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/4N3/4pP2/2N5/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ f3',This move is his blunder. It allows me to make him wish he had put his Queen elsewhere.
1172,33,31,1exf3e.p.,b'2rq1rk1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/4N3/8/2N2p2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I want fewer pieces in the middle.
1173,33,32,1Nxf3,b'2rq1rk1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Much better is 17. Qxf3 breaking up my plan.
1174,33,33,1Re8,b'2rqr1k1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',My Rook is now lined up with the King and Queen.
1175,33,34,1d3,b'2rqr1k1/p3bpp1/4bn1p/8/8/2NP1N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Stops Bc4 which was what I was hoping to do.
1176,33,35,1Bf5,b'2rqr1k1/p3bpp1/5n1p/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Makes for one piece less in the way and moves it to a better diagonal.
1177,33,36,1Qd2,b'2rqr1k1/p3bpp1/5n1p/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I think 19. Kd1 would have been better.
1178,33,37,1Bb4+,b'2rqr1k1/p4pp1/5n1p/5b2/1b6/2NP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Clearly the best move.
1179,33,38,2Kd1,b'2rqr1k1/p4pp1/5n1p/5b2/1b6/2NP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BK3R b - -',Here is blunder two. 20. Kf1 would have been better.
1180,33,39,2Nd5,b'2rqr1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/1b6/2NP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BK3R w - -',Threating to win a piece.
1181,33,40,2Re1,b'2rqr1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/1b6/2NP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BKR3 b - -',This was the best move for him.
1182,33,41,2Bxc3,b'2rqr1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/2bP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BKR3 w - -',Better than Nxc3 but by how  much I am not sure. This move just forces his Queen to move later.
1183,33,42,2Rxe8+,b'2rqR1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/2bP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BK4 b - -',His best move.
1184,33,43,2Qxe8,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/2bP1N2/PPPQ2PP/R1BK4 w - -',Any other move would have been horrible.
1185,33,44,2Qf2,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/2bP1N2/PPP2QPP/R1BK4 b - -',23. bxc3 Nxc3+ 24. Qxc3 Rxc3 would have ended my onslaught but would have lost him his Queen.
1186,33,45,2Bxb2,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/3P1N2/PbP2QPP/R1BK4 w - -',I almost didn't see this. It is the last key to my attack.
1187,33,46,2Bxb2,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/3n1b2/8/3P1N2/PBP2QPP/R2K4 b - -',He logically takes.
1188,33,47,2Ne3+,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3PnN2/PBP2QPP/R2K4 w - -',And now I have checkmating threats coming up.
1189,33,48,2Ke1,b'2r1q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3PnN2/PBP2QPP/R3K3 b - -',I think that 25. Qxe3 Qxe3 may have been slightly better but not by much.
1190,33,49,2Rxc2,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3PnN2/PBr2QPP/R3K3 w - -',I even up the material but am in the winning position.
1191,33,50,2Qg3,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3PnNQ1/PBr3PP/R3K3 b - -',And decides his Queen is more important than his King I guess...
1192,33,51,2Rxb2,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3PnNQ1/Pr4PP/R3K3 w - -',This lets me get up in material and position.
1193,33,52,2Nd2,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/5b2/8/3Pn1Q1/Pr1N2PP/R3K3 b - -',"Here he comments ""bravo bravo"". It shows to me that he no longer wishes to fight off my attack. I thank him for the compliment and thank him for playing against me."
1194,33,53,2Bxd3,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/8/8/3bn1Q1/Pr1N2PP/R3K3 w - -',This allows me to threaten mate in a few.
1195,33,54,2Nb3,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/8/8/1N1bn1Q1/Pr4PP/R3K3 b - -',He gives up.
1196,33,55,2Re2#,b'4q1k1/p4pp1/7p/8/8/1N1bn1Q1/P3r1PP/R3K3 w - -',I was happy with the result of the game. I felt that the game would be different and fun and I was right. Thanks zivomir for the game and thanks to all who view and comment on this. :)
1197,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello everybody!!! I'm annotating this game bacause i liked it very much...It was from a tournament i'm still playing! So it started with e4.
1198,34,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I used to play e5 but now i'm playing my favourite Sicilian defence...
1199,34,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',He choosed that variation playing d4. Not bad but i think Nf3 would be better...
1200,34,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I took the pawn...
1201,34,4,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',And he took it with his queen...
1202,34,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',That seems logical...I actually never played this variation before expept playing it in blitz games...
1203,34,6,Qe3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',He played that move but i think Qd1 would be more safe for his queen...
1204,34,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I opened the other knight...
1205,34,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',That move seems good..
1206,34,9,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',I think this is the greatest move to play...What do  you think?
1207,34,10,Bd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Better would be Nf3 i guess...
1208,34,11,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/4P3/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq d6',And now i was between that move and Be7....My thought was to attack and play more aggresive than playing Be7 which seems more pathetic (i know it is a good move too)...
1209,34,12,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3pP3/8/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',And now he made the first mistake....e5 showed me i took the right decision before...he might ignored the threat that was coming from d4....
1210,34,13,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P3/3p4/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',d4! That was a good move that will give an advantage early in the game being with a knight up for the rest...
1211,34,14,Qg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P1Q1/3p4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',He's protecting his queen for sure!
1212,34,15,dxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P1Q1/8/2p5/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',And i took his knight...
1213,34,16,Bxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P1Q1/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',He took the pawn...Now he wants my knight but i know if i'm gonna play logicaly i won't find some trouble...
1214,34,17,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pn1p/4P1Q1/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',So i played h6 which i think was the best move to do...
1215,34,18,1Qg3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pn1p/4P3/8/2B3Q1/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',He had to protect his queen..

1224,34,27,1b5,b'r1b1kb1r/5pp1/p1q1p2p/1p1nP3/8/2B3Q1/PPP1NPPP/2KR3R w kq b6',b5 looks fine to me...Now i cant move the black bishop to e7 as his queen is pushing the g7 square...

Wait for your comments and your rating and please if it's something to ask write it down or sent me a message....I also have to notice in my game that i did not play 0-0 in the whole game something that is rare for me playing as black...Thanks for reading my annotation...

It has been sufficient to keep the MacCutcheon in relative obscurity since the early 1900's.  And it is likely the most dangerous  for Black.  But I thought there is still some room for innovation and a way to get a lot of action for Black.  This game shows one way to do it.

But I wanted to keep the Bishop in action especially if I could get in ...c5 and Nc6 with a strong center push (which is the strength of the French Defense if White allows it).

It also keeps Black's 2 Bishops.  The downside is that it sacrifices some play against the advanced e-pawn. One strength in Black's system is that Black's g-pawn stops White's supporting f4.   I could have kept all bishops in play by 15...a6 16. Bc5+ Kg8 17. Nd6 looks strong for White.

I have just one pawn net but the 2 Bishops will net more eventually including the f-pawn and maybe the e-pawn.  Then I may have a shot at the White King.

On the one hand it creates a patzer-like impression; my c-pawn is blocked I'm not generating threats I'm not ready to castle short.  But I'm in no mood for a tame four knights game.  Blood will soon fall on the table.
1328,38,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"This is the most popular move for black though there are some important alternatives:
A) 3...d6 is slightly better for black here than on move 2.  Here black now defends the queen with the knight and so may consider keeping the bishop pair and if white exchanges on e5 recapture with that same c6-knight.  Still if white refrains from this capture and just holds the center with d4 he will have slightly the better chances thanks to his strong center and space advantage.
B) 3...Bc5 allows the fork trick but I have found that white is left with some difficulties.  If I remember correctly the line runs: 4. Nxe5 Bxf2+ 5. Kxf2 Nxe5 and now there's a bit of a threat of Qf6+ which white must meet.  I think 6. d4! Qf6+?! 7. Kg1 should leave white better with a timely h4 and Rh3 to free that sad piece.  Meanwhile the black knight will be shuffled to the inferior e7 square and white maintains the two bishops with a safe king.
C) 3...Bb4 is the last and possibly most reasonable try.  White can play 4. Nd5 and on Ba5 we have 
     i) 5. b4?! Bb6 6. Nxb6 axb6 is too costly for white in tempo and the weak half-open a-file and b4 pawn.
     ii) 5. Bb5 transposes to a sort of strange Ruy Lopez with even chances.   
     iii) 5. c3 looks to follow through with a pawn storm either in the center or the queenside.  Flexible and good this is    
          my preferred method.
Note that Ba5 is not forced; black can play Nf6 or Bc5 with the former giving up the bishop pair for insufficient pressure and the latter being met along the same lines as B) above."
1329,38,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',!? This move signals the Halloween Gambit.  White gives up a piece for active piece play space and an attack.  I believe that theory holds that the gambit gives white enough but no more than enough compensation with many chances for black to equalize.  Consequently it is a rare guest at the GM or IM levels where winning with white is key.
1330,38,7,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',There is absolutely nothing else to consider.

1332,38,9,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"This is I think marginally the main line.  The nearly as popular alternative 5...Nc6 is met with a different strategy with the main line running:
6. d5 Ne5 7. f4 Ng6 8. e5 Ng8 9. d6 and the struggle revolves around white trying to plant a knight on c7 black trying to snipe the d-pawn.  There could follow: 9...Qf6 10. Nb5 Kd8 11. Be3 with an unclear position."
1333,38,10,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Here white's main idea is to meet 6...Ng8 with Bc4 and Qf3 going straight for the kill.  Black is not without resources but it will be a long defensive task; on the other hand should he rebut white's initiative black will have a handy extra minor piece!
1334,38,11,Qe7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/5nn1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is not the main line which is Ng8.  At this point I was out of book.  So the point is clear: White's e-pawn is pinned so the knight cannot be taken.  It seems that white can try Bc4 and castle but then black has time to play d6 and maybe Be6.  White must be alert and not let that precious initiative slip away.  So instead of sticking with the plan it's time to improvise.
1335,38,12,Be2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/5nn1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This move seems right.  White can castle next renews the threat to the knight and overall just holds the position well.  
1336,38,13,Ng8,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/6n1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now this is forced.

1338,38,15,Qd8,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3NP3/3P4/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black must cover the c7 square.
1339,38,16,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3NP3/3P4/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',If only I could place a knight on the f3 square white's crushing lead in development would surely be decisive!  Piece down though things are less clear.

1342,38,19,1Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pbppp/2p3n1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! Black's position is in a bad way but maybe Black could have tried Ne7-d5? Or perhaps Bb4 followed by Ne7?  Here it is hard to see how black will castle short or long except by playing Nh6.  But white isn't just going to sit on his hands and let black do that...

Of course black's position is quite poor so he cannot exploit white's inaccuracy and the line chosen is still good enough to win.  The rest of the game needs no comment or has no insight from me at least so I'll leave it to the readers to pick it apart if they are so inclined.
