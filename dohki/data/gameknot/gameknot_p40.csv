With black's N on c6, however, this wasn't going to work, because taking on e5, would allow ...NXN in which, I actually would lose a piece for a pawn.  So, I find something as good, already seeing a potential weakness.  Since black has just waisted time with his last move, I was  going to get my K to safety.  Of course, that's important, and would've likely played it, anyway.  But, the other idea is that, when my development is complete, I'll have my Rooks connected which might be the cornerstone to setting up black for disaster, given that I already have a small space advantage since space is very important."

The reason why I didn't like 4.Ba4, was that black's next move would be 4...b5, and after 5.b3, a6, I had to think about where to place the B, to prevent 6...a4 which I think would lose the B very quickly because if 7.d5, black could answer with 7...c6  Something I was worry about, so to prevent stress (which has negatively affected performance) I exchange to prevent problems or complications.  For that reason, I felt uncomfortable doing it.  But, there's more to it then meets the eye.  In addition, exchanging on c6 doubled up my opponents including Jack's pawns.  But, as I learned from tactical-abyss, it's pointless.  He said when doubled pawns are good or not.  As a general rule, doubled pawns will benefit you on the b file.  However, they are no harmful, until major pieces have been exchanged.  After that, this is when you would want to avoid doubled.  So, in it, Joe actually stated that doubled pawns in Ruy Lopez, for example, was of no asset.  And, by that, he was actually alluding to this position.  In addition, to prevent 5...b5, as 5.c4 also would've resulted in this, I considered 5.Bd3, but the reason I decided against it is that it would cost me a tempo to get my DSB into play, when I really need that time to develop, especially if I'm to exploit my opponents weakness.  That's because Susan Polgar said that the way you punish your opponent for not opening properly is to calmly develop.  And, I ruled against 5.Be2, as now my LSB would be very uncomfortable and locked in on that square.  This would be close to as bad, as if the N were on there, since, now my Q would be blocked, whereas now, it can still be mobile.  So, with that and some very careful considerations, I decided to play the most common move. "

The difference, however, is that it involved the French Defense, in the Tarrasch variation.  You will note that this course was, in fact, a lecture.  The last time I listened to lectures involved unusual openings known as the Owen's, followed by, the Grunfeld Defense.  Since it was unusual, it was one of the few things that I didn't remember, though, I sort of wish I had since it's good to get used to things that are unusual, and those lectures involved a variations.  The big differences here is that, unlike the other two openings, the French Defense is a very standard opening, and the Tarrasch Variation is what's, most often, played, from what I think she implied.  In addition, this one with Susan Polgar was even harder since there were more variations.  But, because of how often it was played, even though I wasn't going to remember (since you'd have to memorize which as I've learned from GM's Susan Polgar and Damian Lemos, the one thing you don't want to do is memorize anything.)  Instead, it's about understanding and why they happen, I wasn't going to bother remembering everything.  But, I was going to remember the most important things which was the cornerstone.  I forgot the exact variation, that is weather three or four.  I actually think it was four, so somewhere missing one.  What I know, however, is that white kicks black N's not just to gain tempo, but also, to achieve a solid pawn chain in the opening to give white an advantage.  So, it is something like 1.e4, e6 2.d4, Nf6 3.e5  The only difference here is that it is not the French Defense, and it didn't happen in three or four, but rather, 8 moves.  However, I am applying the same concepts and treating it, as if this was the Tarrash Variation as it's what I'm comfortable.  Moreover, which I took right into consideration is that the same thing that makes it special with the French is happening here.  That, I have a solid pawn chain early, so the position is not much different as that of other defense.  But, in this case, it does and is, therefore, an inaccuracy because of where it's headed. "

Not on the b file, but rather near the K.  Now, this brings me to a question because tactical-abyss made a very good point, and one was proven in my last annotation.  He said that opening up your pawns around the K is not always a bad thing, depending on the position.  Before that, I thought that it always, and that's what other's including masters were saying, but he proved that it wasn't, depending on the position.  I was wondering if pawn structures around the K, so doubled pawns on the f file would be harmful was.  In this case, I thought it was, and in that case, wasn't going to take chances.  Therefore, for the first time in a while, where I actually went wrong, with my last move, I am now forced to cram one of my N's on d2.  I was wondering for a while now, but figured out why it is uncomfortable.  The reason being is that, if black makes the right choice, he'll get the space advantage back now because having to put on my Knight on d2 means that I'll have to, at least, one tempo to complete development.  Whereas, had I not attacked it, I don't think he would've played this.  So, thinking that I'm now in trouble based on what happened, I really start thinking about how to get out but have confidence because, unlike last time, he is not a stronger player.  Consequently, I do have hope."

The reason being isn't so much because of material, but rather, it is the fact that black's K is terribly exposed, that I consider it quite resignable.  Black went wrong by pushing pawns, and advancing his weakest pawn on the chess board.  By doing this, he created a big weakness for himself allowing me to have an advantage by the third move, so I just used that needed time to develop my pieces, castle, and control the center.  In addition, I planned accurately and strategized to expose his weakness which, in the end, proved to be devastating."

I would say, when reading any middle game text that begins harping on about bishops, to rip that chapter out.

Even Euwe mentions a bad bishop need not necessarily be bad and a good bishop necessarily good so why the hell bother labelling either bishop as such?

Now, @knightrider62: another lesson to learn, as vesper plays it and you see it a lot is that 1.d4 is also common.  Some people also refer to that as best by test.  But, the reason that 1.e4 is better to learn is that the common lines do not require as much complications, so it's easier to remember.  As key technique, as I learned from Susan Polgar is that the one thing you don't want to do with openings is to memorize them.  So, after that lesson, I replied and told Susan that I agreed.

Plus, we were nearing the endgame.  So, I offered Jack a draw.  But, he declined, in it asking me why.  And, I told him the reason which is what I stated.  Then, he said that I had to play it out first.  That's because as he directly told me me, ""Anything can happen, as we know.""

And, it was before I learned that just because things were level, doesn't mean that it's even.

But she would be ill-advised to do so yet, as it is possible for Black to set up an impenetrable barrier against the WK's invasion.  She should  simply hold the Black pieces to ransom, and manoeuvre her King as far forward as he can safely reach, before liquidating.  So: 27.Kf1! Qa3  28.Ke1!  Qb4ch  29.Ke2 Qb5ch  30.Kf2 ... Observe that by taking four moves instead of one to reach this square, White has prevented Black from obtaining the space to go all out for a perpetual check.  White can afford to be patient.  30... Qb4  31.Kg3 Qe1ch 32.Kh3 Qf2.  Now the WK is far enough forward to have an immediate effect in the pawn end game.  33.Qxf8ch Qxf8  34.Bxf8 Kxf8  35.Kg4 Kg7  36.h4!

Consolation is the crampness of Black's position, with his knight's bottled up away from what appears to be the likely kingside site of action and the doubled pawns which close what would otherwise have been a dangerously open file.

It wouldbe badfor black's pawn structure, cause after me taking on g6 he would most certainly have to take with the f pawn. So the kingside would be easier to be attacked later. Usually there is a knight on f6, who prevents the h5 move. But now if black plays 5... Nf6 I'll play 6. e5 on the spot and still be able to play h5 in a while. "
