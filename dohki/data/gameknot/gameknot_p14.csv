Well, I am glad you have enjoyed Part 1, now here comes Part 2, I am playing against the same opponent and this game has some parallels to the last.  I thought I would play David at his own game.  The English Opening by starting with 1.c4."

Fancy voluntarily giving up the exchange to an IM when already down on material!  But there is some method in the madness.  I do get one of my pawns back as well as the knight and the c7 pawn is very vulnerable indeed and at the moment I am tying his rook down to the defense of it.  Also, Glenda now has the opportunity to yet again make her presence felt."
