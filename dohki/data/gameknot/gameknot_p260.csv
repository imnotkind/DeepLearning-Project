A lot of players tend to fall to the knight fork but there are also other forks some that can be very easy to miss the humble pawn fork.  In the three games I am about to show you I had the pleasure of executing such a tactical shot.  In this game sadly due to my inexperience at converting a won position I settled for a draw when I should have gone on to win.  Now I have a little more patience.

71,1,13,Nf8,b'3qrnk1/2p2pp1/1p5p/p2PP3/2P2P2/4R3/2Q3P1/6K1 w - -',"Here I make the biggest mistake of my chessic career - a bad draw offer!  Nowadays I hope I am a bit more discerning and patient before I hit that offer draw button.  The way to defend yourself against making bad draw offers in advantageous positions is to have a plan to convert these positions - planless play leads to inferior results.  Here is what Coach Ion had to say in his post match pm.  Hello jstevens1! 
I think the way to learn how to convert late-game advantages is to play them out - indeed even play out endings that look drawish if there looks as though there's still play left. You'll flub the odd one into unnecessary draws or losses that happens to everyone (I can think of three or four at least that I've flubbed on GK) but you will bring home the desired result a whole deal more often and your ""conversion"" rate can only improve with time. 

Now in your game against yakky I don't really like your last move but it doesn't compromise your winning chances much: you ought still to win from the final position. I do wonder though whether you had made up your mind to offer the draw before you played the move or afterwards. 

Anyhow I'm going to take the game from White's last move 1.d5: 

Instead of 1...Nf8 Black could play 1...Nf6 exploiting the pin on the e-pawn to bring the knight to an active square. But it also carries a threat namely 2...Nxd5 3.cxd5 Qxc5 4.Qxc7 Qd4 with attack on the pinned rook and the f-pawn. Black ought to emerge from this 3 pawns to the good but even if you ended up only two ahead (White plays 2.g3 say and you went ahead with the exchange) you would have a near-on winning advantage still (1...Nf6 2.g3 Nxd5!? 3.cxd5 Qxd5 4.Qxc7 Qd4 5.Kf2 [Black would be more than happy with 5.Qc3 Qxc3 with 2 remote passed pawns in a rook ending - an easy win] 5...a4!?). 

Incidentally this looks like an example of a theme in the latest ""Novice Nook"" thread. Ordinarily White would want to keep the pieces on and so here. The pure Q P and R P endings are all hopeless for White pretty much. This adds another string to your bow: a latent threat to force piece exchanges. 

Of course after 1...Nf6 2.g3 you might not want to give up the knight in this way and that's fair enough. It might not be the best or simplest way to go. Instead you could redeploy the knight 2...Nd7 3...Nc5 and then start probing on the "
72,2,0,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black normally waits until around move 9 before playing this but it probably doesn't make any difference.

This knight will move to f8 to make room for my lsb to come out as I am lagging behind a bit in development.  This allows a discovered check but all that happens is that the queens get swapped off.

Over the next few moves a plan to liquidate the weak e and f pawns brews up and ebervesces into an astounding tactical melee!

400,14,16,Nf5+,b'8/pp6/2p2k1p/4nnpB/PPbN4/6K1/5N1P/8 w - -',38. ........ Nf5  I now succeed in removing more wood from the board without compromising my pawn structure.

402,14,18,4Bf3,b'8/pp2kb2/2p4p/3n1Kp1/P3N3/5B2/7P/8 b - -',46. Bf3 - this allows the exchange of another pair of pieces without compromising my pawn structure.
403,14,19,5Bf3,b'8/pp2k3/2p2n1p/6p1/P2K4/5B1P/8/8 b - -',51. Bf3 - keeping one set of minor pieces on the board - if you are a pawn down or more in a king and pawn endgame it is a lost endgame (assuming no doubletons or isolanis)
404,14,20,5Kd6,b'8/pp6/2pk1n1p/6p1/P2K4/5B1P/8/8 w - -',51. ......... Kd6!! - now we get another tactic the knight and the king are both on dark squares white has a lsb.  This king move keeps out the white king.  I call this tactic the Joblock - it is very effective here.
405,14,21,Ke5,b'8/p7/5n1p/1K2k1p1/8/5B1P/8/8 w - -',54. .......... Ke5 - over the last few moves I decided to liquidate my queenside pawns to get my king over to the kingside and try and crown one or both of my kingside pawns.  It will be the g pawn that will spell checkmate for my opponent.  My a pawn is a handy decoy for the white king forcing him to waste 2 vital tempi in capturing the pawn.  Thankfully this decision paid off.
406,14,22,5Bc8,b'2B5/p7/K4n1p/6p1/8/6kP/8/8 b - -',57. Bc8 - defends the h pawn but the knight will soon round it up and eat it up.
407,14,23,6Kc5,b'2B5/8/7p/2K3p1/8/6kn/8/8 b - -',60 . Kc5 - the white king is approaching fast?  Will he get to g1 on time?  I now guard the queening square with Nf2 which will force white to give up his bishop.  Notice that I cannot lose this game with the fall of the h pawn whatever happens now.
408,14,24,h2,b'2B5/8/8/6p1/8/6k1/5n1p/5K2 w - -',64. ........ h2 - prevents the wk from reaching g1.
409,14,25,Nf2,b'8/8/8/6p1/8/6k1/5n2/6K1 w - -',67. ........... Nf2 - the knight moves and forces Kf1 - it is white's only legal move.  Must be careful must not allow the wrong kind of mate!
410,14,26,Kh2,b'8/8/8/6p1/8/8/5n1k/5K2 w - -',68. ....... Kh2 - my king feels bad about giving up his beloved steed but soon he is about to get a new wife (not sure it is a good thing - marriages were not always made in heaven in medieval times!!).  It was midnight on Sunday 18 May 2008.  I set my alarm clock for 645 am BST and at the same time set up 69 ......... g4 as a conditional move just in case white takes the knight.
411,14,27,7Kf1,b'8/8/8/8/6p1/8/7k/5K2 b - -',70. Kf1 then resigns - my alarm clock goes off I log in at about 645 BST on Monday morning.  I am greeted by a white flag from my opponent as he cannot stop the g pawn from crowning and then proceeding to play a deadly game of kiss chase with the white king!   Wheeew what a relief!!

Should he try to exploit White's queen position? How can he make use of the two semi-open files? Can he make constructive use of the two weak pawns?
608,23,10,1Rb5,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/4n3/1r2p1q1/4Q3/1PKP3P/P1P1NPP1/R6R w - -',The first priority is to develop the rook on f8. 19...Rb5 is okay if Black's plan is to double rooks. 
609,23,11,Nc5,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/8/1rn1p1q1/4Q3/1P1P3P/PKP1NPP1/R6R w - -',Chasing the queen around doesn't really achieve anything. 20...f5 looks good at first glance but after 21.Qc4 Black is in some difficulty. 20...Rd8 or 20...Rb8 is best.
610,23,12,Qf6,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/5q2/1rn1p3/6Q1/1P1P3P/PKP1NPP1/R6R w - -',21...Nxd3  is playable and leads to a draw by perpetual check.
611,23,13,2Raf1,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/5q2/1rn1p3/6Q1/1P1P3P/PKP1NPP1/5R1R b - -',A bad move. Rooks shouldn't be used to defend pawns. There was nothing wrong with the simple 22.f3. In fact the pawn doesn't need defending straight away - 22.Qc4 improves the position of the queen whilst also attacking the rook. An alternative was to play Rhf1 not to defend the pawn but to support its advance.
612,23,14,2e4+,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/5q2/1rn5/4p1Q1/1P1P3P/PKP1NPP1/5R1R w - -',Not as good as it looks because White can answer with 23.d4. Developing the rook on f8 is still the best move.

616,23,18,Rg5,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/8/6r1/3N4/1P1n3P/P4PP1/1K3R1R w - -',The rook should occupy one of the open files. 26...Rd5 can be followed up by ...Rfd8. The rooks must work in tandem.
617,23,19,Rd8,b'3r2k1/p1p2ppp/8/6r1/3N2P1/1P1n3P/P4P2/1K3R1R w - -',Now this isn't so good because it allows White a fork.
618,23,20,Ra8,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2N5/6r1/6P1/1P1n3P/P4P2/1K3R1R w - -',The rook is no better here than it was on f8.
619,23,21,3Rf3,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2N5/2r5/5PP1/1P1n1R1P/P7/1K5R b - -',White needs to get rid of that powerful knight and this appears to be the only way.
620,23,22,Nd5,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/8/2rn4/1N4P1/1P3R1P/P7/1K5R w - -',Rook endings are notoriously difficult to win so it might have been better to keep the knights on.
621,23,23,3Re1,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/8/3r4/6P1/1P3R1P/P7/1K2R3 b - -',White's best plan was to pressurize the weak pawn on c7 with Rc1 and Rfc3.
622,23,24,3Rad8,b'3r2k1/p1p2ppp/8/3r4/6P1/1P3R1P/P7/1K2R3 w - -',Better late than never!
623,23,25,3Kb1,b'6k1/p1p2p1p/6p1/8/P5P1/1PR4P/r7/1K6 b - -',Kd3 must be better.
624,23,26,Rxg4,b'6k1/R4p1p/6p1/8/P5r1/1P6/K7/8 w - -',If we could take the rooks off it's an easy win for Black but with them still on the board it's probably a draw.
625,23,27,h5,b'6k1/1R3p2/6p1/7p/P5r1/1P6/K7/8 w - h6',I think this is where it starts to go wrong. White will win a straight race so Black needs an alternative strategy. He should probably move his rook to a better position before he starts advancing his pawns.
626,23,28,4Rd7,b'6k1/3R1p2/6p1/7p/P5r1/1P6/K7/8 b - -',I don't know why he didn't just play a5.
627,23,29,4h4,b'6k1/3R1p2/6p1/8/P5rp/1P6/K7/8 w - -',Now Black is ahead in the race!
628,23,30,g3,b'8/5pk1/P7/8/7r/1P4pp/1K6/7R w - -',50...Rh8 51.a7 Ra8 wins.
629,23,31,5a7,b'8/P4pk1/8/8/7r/1P4pp/1K6/7R b - -',Now Black can only draw.
630,23,32,5g2,b'8/P4pk1/8/8/7r/1P5p/1K4p1/7R w - -',This loses. ...Rh8 was again the best move.

R(a)c1 would give extra support and develop his rook onto my king's file in the process or even R(d)c1 loading up the rooks on my queenside. but this wastes another move as he'll be looking to push these pawns for sure. and besides he doesn't really need to back his pawn up it's in no immediate danger.

a subtle mistake but one that loses. i believe Be3 was the only move to save as the bishop was vulnerable to capture from the rook. the reason the bishop is so important to white is he must take the knight with it at some stage though not yet or he loses material. now he cannot capture the knight and as such is in deep trouble. i cannot be 100% sure but i think black now has mate in 12 assuming best play from both. if anyone feels like analysing feel free to post your findings. i spent hours analysing this part of the game and i reckon mate in 12. i get there quicker though."

it's worthy of note this one as it shows white is aware of the danger he is in and he is attempting to get out of trouble with intelligent play. he can avoid mate if i move toward the knight by sacrificing a bishop thus giving him time to regroup.

so anyone fancy analysing see how long a forced mate that was? like i said earlier i think it's a string of 12 moves maximum but it's so complex there's so many moves white can make during this string that it's beyond the puzzle maker here at gameknot certainly from move 24. have fun!"

776,31,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"(game info on previous page) Bird's opening (A03) named after the 19th century English master Henry Bird probably just comes outside the bracket of the most popular opening moves: e4 d4 c4 Nf3 and g3.  They all try and contribute to control of the Centre (Nf3 and g2 in a more hyper-modern way) but Bird is less popular than The English (c4) because it weakens WT's King-Side and WT has to watch that fools mate diagonal (e1-h4).  Bent Larsen however used it to good effect.

820,32,13,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2p3/4P3/5Bn1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Develops the bishop without overextending it and allows for black to castle and at the same time place his rook on the potentially open f file.

the icing on the cake now the black queen is seriously overworked and black's position collapses. the bishop is attacked and pinned to the queen the knight is pinned to both the queen and rook and for good measure i attack the pawn on d6 since the bishop is also pinned to his king by my nicely placed bishop. the black queen is burdened with the task of protecting the knight and the rook since if the rook is unprotected the knight remains pinned and the bishop remains helpless. remember 24...
