But I also have played enough games with manfred12g to know he checks fast and likes to bring his queen out really early. I had just lost two games in a row to him and hoped I would not lose three by getting into some odd erratic game that he often fares better in if I am not careful.

132,2,5,fxe5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4P3/4P3/6P1/PPPP3P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I decide to follow the DB suggestions here for a while. The main thing here for me and this line is that I want to get that F file opened up. It creates weaknesses no doubt for white especially from play between black's queen and black bishop but that's just a risk I am willing to take for a little excitement now and then. 
133,2,6,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP3P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I feel I  know his style and know he will attack that Knight with his DS Bishop and I will have doubled pawns. But I am not so afraid of doubled pawns anymore though I prefer to live without them. My other option was D3 but he would still 99.99% attack the knight and trade it off. I know this. Then I am still in a situation. If I pull out my bishop to block check he will take my B2 pawn with his Queen and things get too annoying too fast for me. 
134,2,7,Nf3,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/1b2P3/2N2NP1/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is still in the DB actually.

136,2,9,bxc3,b'rnb1k1nr/ppppqppp/8/8/4P3/2P2NP1/P1PPQ2P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I figure my D pawn to either D3 or D4 will not be that bad. Since the attack with the King's Gambit will occur from my Kingside I do not fret overly about my Queenside falling into tatters. My side looks all messed up (and I guess it is) but I have made four pawn moves so far and have one active piece on the board. His queen is guarding his king and not a good thing after I get castled and my rook can move to the E file but I know he will castle as soon as he can  so do not even make plans around that.

If a viewer now does not play the King's Gambit often the set up may look overly vulnerable (and there are problems for me) but the open F file with a willingness to take a risk and make sacrifices may help out later. Or it may not. 
139,2,12,1Bg2,b'rnb2rk1/ppppqppp/5n2/8/4P3/2PP1NP1/P1P1Q1BP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Not that I am trying to fianchetto to attack his rook later or anything. I am sort of forced into this awkward position by his line of attack in the beginning. Normally my bishop would be on C4 now aiming at the F7 square hoping for a break later. 
140,2,13,1h6,b'rnb2rk1/ppppqpp1/5n1p/8/4P3/2PP1NP1/P1P1Q1BP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I am not a high level player and I am a terrible game analysist but at the level I play I see this move so often and am not sure I consider it a good move. It is meant to stop my knight from going to G5 but without my bishop on C4 that is a weak line of attack for me right now. It also weakens his castled position way too soon in the game. By my being willing as would many players to sacrifice my DS bishop his castled king would become totally exposed. I think better to let the pawn sit unless the knight encroaches then chase him off. It is a necessary move at times but here I think moving  the G7 pawn becomes the objective for white now.

In fact I think it is better to leave the other guy's pawns doubled up. A move or two ago I was fretting over the doubled pawns and now my opponent helps me out of the bind at the cost of one point in material. But gambits are all about loss of material and a bit of reckless hope. 
143,2,16,Qxc3,b'rnb2rk1/pppp1pp1/5n1p/8/4P3/2qPBNP1/P1P1Q1BP/R4RK1 w - -',I know I cannot wait for manfred12g to sort things out. He has moved his Queen just too many times and has let seven piece remain untouched but that will not last long. But he traded off (unwisely in the King's Gambit) a piece he really needed in my view as white and that was his DS bishop. 
144,2,17,1Bd4,b'rnb2rk1/pppp1pp1/5n1p/8/3BP3/2qP1NP1/P1P1Q1BP/R4RK1 b - -',I assume he will move to C6.

230,5,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I wanted to do something different probably why I never gained ground. Moved c6 in preparation for d5.
231,5,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Since I never really opened with c6 before I was unprepared for this advance. Although in hindsight it seems like it shouldn't affect my plan butIdid decide to not push d5.
232,5,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I wish I would have moved d5 instead of d6. I typically am more aggressive and wanted to try a defensive move instead. Also this move took the game out of the database. Probably more of a disadvantage for me to do that.
233,5,4,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',That looks imposing.

236,5,7,h3,b'rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPPb1/5N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Worked as planned although not much of an advantage.

Only real benefit I could see is to further disturb the king's pawns but the there's that massive pawn onslaught down the middle I'll have to deal with. Never been here before so we'll see what happens.
238,5,9,Qxf3,b'rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Oops I guess that really didn't work out at all. I just traded my bishop for a knight for no apparent benefit.

It bothers me my pawns and minor pieces are relatively undeveloped and the queen is out front. I haven't been in a game like this where I've done well without an opponent blunder.

256,5,27,1Rxd7,b'1k3b1r/pp1rpBpp/2pp4/8/1nP2P2/1Q1qB2P/PP4P1/RN3RK1 w - -',I wanted to remove the pawn promotion threat and didn't consider 15... c5. That would have supported the knight and stopped the bishop from taking a2 but I didn't think of it during the game.
257,5,28,1Bxa7+,b'1k3b1r/Bp1rpBpp/2pp4/8/1nP2P2/1Q1q3P/PP4P1/RN3RK1 b - -',With the bishop and queen on this side I thought there must be a mate coming very shortly. My goal was to defend until the end.
258,5,29,1Qxb4,b'5b1r/kp1rpBpp/2pp4/8/1QP2P2/3q3P/PP4P1/RN3RK1 b - -',I am surprised the 15... Rxd7 wasn't considered a mistake. The c5 move really seemed to accelerate the loss.

262,5,33,b4,b'5b1r/2k1p1pp/1qPr4/3B4/1p3P2/Q1N4P/PP4PK/R4R2 w - -',A fork! In this game I have to have my mini victories as I lose.

266,6,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Probably one of the nicest games I have ever played not in the sens that it contains beautiful combinations or sacrifices but because of the accurate moves I consider having made at the right time. I guess there are still much to say about them but though.
267,6,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',When I see f5 at this level I usually think the guy knows better than me...

272,6,6,1h6,b'r2q1rk1/pbppb3/1p2p2p/n4pp1/2PP4/P1NQ1NP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',the black king side pawns line looks ready to swarm by...
273,6,7,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/pbppb3/1p2p2p/n4pp1/1PPP4/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - b3',So I had to counter and find some space by myself
274,6,8,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/pbppb3/1pn1p2p/2P2pp1/1P1P4/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',I really think hard the next 4-5 moves with a lot of variations
275,6,9,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/1bppb3/1pn1p2p/p1PP1pp1/1P6/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',this point is crucial. I had to consider axb exd or an escape for the knight. I have to admit I barely considered what will come next thinking more that he could play Nb8 potentially coming back to d7 when the black pawn would be gone.
276,6,10,1Na7,b'r2q1rk1/nbppb3/1p2p2p/p1PP1pp1/1P6/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',I guess Nb5 was his main goal here
277,6,11,bxa5,b'r2q1rk1/nb1pb3/4p2p/p2P1pp1/8/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',looks like i am in charge for the cleaning
278,6,12,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/nb1pb3/4p2p/p2PNpp1/8/P1NQ2P1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',that's the risky business. I pointed out that g6 was clear and an eventual option in case of trouble due to f8 - e7
279,6,13,1Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/nb1p4/4pb1p/p2PNpp1/8/P1NQ2P1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',and I have to admit I under estimated this move...
280,6,14,2Nc4,b'r2q1rk1/nb1p4/4pb1p/p2P1pp1/2N5/P1NQ2P1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',So I came back here which was not my goal
281,6,15,2Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/nb1p4/4pb1p/p2P1pp1/2N5/P1NQ2P1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',totoman will now put all his forces to the holes I created...
282,6,16,2dxe6,b'2rq1rk1/nb1p4/4Pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/P1NQ2P1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',And I made one more... The idea was to exchange without loss so I had to defend fast my knights
283,6,17,2Kxg2,b'2rq1rk1/n2p4/4Pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/P1NQ2P1/4PPKP/R4R2 b - -',bye bye bishops... the last one won't last.
284,6,18,Qc7,b'2r2rk1/n1q5/4pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/P1NQ2P1/4PPKP/2R2R2 w - -',two on c4 and three on c3 if c4 goes back...
285,6,19,2Nd1,b'2r2rk1/n1q5/4pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/P2Q2P1/4PPKP/2RN1R2 b - -',I considered patiently all the options and I fond out this one had to be the best to help at e to h defense.
286,6,20,2Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/n1q5/4pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/P2Q2P1/4PPKP/2RN1R2 w - -',fair enough but without big threats
287,6,21,Qc6+,b'2rr2k1/n7/2q1pb1p/p4pp1/2N5/PQ4P1/4PPKP/2RN1R2 w - -',I think totoman could have reserved this move for a later trick. Here there is no trick.
288,6,22,Qe4,b'2rr2k1/n7/4pb1p/p4pp1/2N1q3/PQ4P1/4PP1P/2RN1RK1 w - -',and this attack seems to me without consequence. actually I will have the surprise moves now.
289,6,23,h5,b'2rr2k1/n7/4pb2/p5pp/2N1q3/PQ4P1/4PPN1/2R2RK1 w - -',pressing
290,6,24,3Nce3,b'2rr2k1/n7/4pb2/p5pp/4q3/PQ2N1P1/4PPN1/2R2RK1 b - -',with a constant threat now on e6 (which strangely will last the most)
291,6,25,3f3,b'3r2k1/n7/4pb2/p5p1/4q2p/PQ2NPP1/4P1N1/2R3K1 b - -',and this is my surprise... I felt really comfortable with the next four-five moves. And for the first time in the game I started to consider winning 
292,6,26,3Ng4,b'3r2k1/n7/4pb2/p3q1p1/6Np/PQ3PP1/4P1N1/2R3K1 b - -',I thought he would prefer to take g3...
293,6,27,3Qxe2,b'3r2k1/n7/4pb2/p5p1/6Np/PQ3PP1/4q1N1/2R3K1 w - -',but no...
294,6,28,Kh8,b'3r3k/n7/4pN2/p5p1/7p/PQ3PP1/4q1N1/2R3K1 w - -',that was probably the good answer. But this leads to the fact that e6 is still under the queen charge.
295,6,29,3Qe3,b'3r3k/n7/4pN2/p5p1/7p/P3QPP1/4q1N1/2R3K1 b - -',I could have played Re1 the next move would have probably be the same. Here I force at least the rook exchange with a preference for the queens.
296,6,30,3Rxd1,b'7k/n7/4pN2/p5p1/7p/P3QPP1/4q1N1/3R2K1 b - -',forced
297,6,31,3Kxg3,b'7k/n7/4pN2/p5p1/8/P3QPK1/6N1/3q4 b - -',so let us consider the action now. My two last pawns are globally protected. I am pretty sure I can assure the draw without a problem. Hiw own pawns are unprotected and far from each other. Hiw knights is poorly placed and under threat. Black has to solve many problems at once.
298,6,32,4Nxf4,b'7k/n7/3qpN2/p7/5N2/P3Q1K1/8/8 b - -',having considered that e5 would not have been a real threat: N4 could have be gone to d5 or h5 with great comfort.
299,6,33,4Nc6,b'7k/8/2nqpN2/p7/5N2/P3Q1K1/8/8 w - -',finally coming back.
300,6,34,4Ne4,b'7k/8/2nqp3/p7/4NN2/P3Q1K1/8/8 b - -',getting the queen out of my diagonal
301,6,35,4Qe5,b'7k/8/2n1p3/p3q3/4NN2/P3Q1K1/8/8 w - -',Oh my! this is a huge mistake as I can now force the exchange...
302,6,36,4Nxc3,b'7k/8/2n1p3/p7/5N2/P1N3K1/8/8 b - -',I had calculated a reasonable risk of draw. Of course tototman could have imagined to catch my pawn for example by playing Nb4 but I would not have taken his knight for my pawn. Mating with my last two knight though theoretically possible needs the benevolence of the opponent. I had to preserve my pawn. And it was quite easier than it looks to impeach black night to go to the b1 - c2 - c4 or b5 threatening positions.
303,6,37,4e5,b'7k/8/2n5/p3p3/5N2/P1N3K1/8/8 w - -',thanks the knight had to move anyway
304,6,38,4Nfd5,b'7k/8/2n5/p2Np3/8/P1N3K1/8/8 b - -',as the knight on c3 blocks the two b1 and b5 position My other knight had the simple job to block the c2 and c4 position. I had in mind Ng2-e3 but now I can come by the center which is much more comfortable.
305,6,39,4Nd4,b'7k/8/8/p2Np3/3n4/P1N3K1/8/8 w - -',pointing on c2 already
306,6,40,4Ne3,b'7k/8/8/p3p3/3n4/P1N1N1K1/8/8 b - -',blocked
307,6,41,4Kf2,b'8/6k1/8/p3p3/3n4/P1N1N3/5K2/8 b - -',there was no more short way... 
308,6,42,4Kd3,b'8/8/8/p3p3/3n1k2/P1NKN3/8/8 b - -',ideally positionned now: my king block the c2 and c4 so my Ne3 can go fishing
309,6,43,Kf3,b'8/8/8/p2Np3/8/PnNK1k2/8/8 w - -',no I didn't forget the e-column threat. It was included in the package.
310,6,44,5Kc4,b'8/8/1N6/p1n1p3/2K5/P1N2k2/8/8 b - -',I was ready to give my c3 knight for the e-column pawn without any regret: he had done well and deserved to rest. The idea was no to chase the black knight far from his own pawn taking the pawn on e2 so I had his king as far as possible from a-column.

471,10,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',...there are more mistakes and psychology IS a bigger thing than I thought. I was asked by one of my opponents why I waited so long to join the USCF etc etc.... oh that's right my age is on a need to know basis. Although I'll bet not too many of you would beat me in a crit or a cycling road race. ;) Anyways my response is I've always enjoyed chess more as a fun hobby; to reach my full potential I would have to give up far too many other interests I currently enjoy... back to the game. Nf3 an interesting opening that can transpose into many different setups...
472,10,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Well I'm going to see his intentions immediately by playing - if you've seen ANY of my games you'll know I like the Caro-Kann. I'll have something now to look into... 1. ...c6 is probably not best here! Oh well.
473,10,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',And his response is not the best response either. Although we can transpose into book I don't think this is mainstream so far.
474,10,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Maybe the Reti? Anyone? I'm not up at all on the Reti or English variations. I really don't know what white is doing here. This could transpose into one of the Caro-Kann variations I haven't seen much of. We'll see.
475,10,4,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White has played a passive move albeit it will allow the dark-squared bishop to exert pressure from the flank. Reti? Nimzowitsch? This is what happens when you get a white player who wants to play a certain way with a black player who wants to play a certain way. An odd opening that ends up being not quite what either of us is shooting for. One problem for white that occurs later is that flank openings should be played with the idea of pressuring the center. White fails to do this properly and you'll see the result soon.
476,10,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Playing as if it's a regular Caro-Kann. At this point why not.
477,10,6,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2P5/1PN2N2/P2PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I decided not to take that pawn. Here I thought about moving d4 forcing the knight to retreat or move to the side of the board. But I felt little was to be gained; one consideration for certain flank openings is to try to get your opponent's center overextended and I didn't want to take that on quite so early until I had time to think on it more.
478,10,7,d3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2P5/1PNP1N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Fritz dislikes this move. I'm not fond of it either. Again I was tempted to advance that pawn right now. But no there's too much developing needing...
479,10,8,h3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2P5/1PNP1N1P/P3PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Well I'm developing. At this point of the opening I was a little dumbfounded by this move. See here's why: is white considering a kingside pawn storm? If so then why is his queenside pawns wide open? Where will his king find safety? When one's opponent is good but a little bad or bad but a little good well then all one can do is play the board. I decide just for fun to see what happens if...
480,10,9,h5,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/2p1p3/3p1b1p/2P5/1PNP1N1P/P3PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq h6',I have just tempted him to think about playing now on the kingside. Maybe he'll play with those pawns over there and leave his king vulnerable. Such a move against a really strong player would be a little dangerous for black. At this point none of Fritz's evaluations indicate any danger towards black even if this looks awful positionally.
481,10,10,Bf4,b'r2qk1nr/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3p1b1p/2P2B2/1PNP1N1P/P3PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Here my opponent wastes a tempo. Why move the bishop to threaten the queen unless you expected to trade bishop for bishop as there is no real other move for black? Well okay; you might say f6 or Ne7. But I wanted to meet aggression with aggression and wanted my bishop on that diagonal if I could; f6 would have made that plan too slow.
482,10,11,Bf6,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb2/3p1b1p/2P2B2/1PNP1N1P/P3PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',So I get my bishop to that diagonal even though very soon I'll make that bishop worth a lot less because of another plan I decide to implement that I liked. The bishop needed to be there anyways for that plan another reason to not move the knight there which would not help. Without that plan Nf6 is really only slightly better. At this point I see no rhyme or reason to my opponent's moves here unless he were to immediately crash down on the center hard...
483,10,12,Qc2,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb2/3p1b1p/2P2B2/1PNP1N1P/P1Q1PPP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',But he's not ready to and will miss that opportunity something he should have been doing by now.
484,10,13,d4,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb2/5b1p/2Pp1B2/1PNP1N1P/P1Q1PPP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',With more supporting pieces out and my pawn structure approximating what I want I do not fear advancing that d pawn now. It's a good way of getting a space advantage if my opponent chooses not to open the board. At this point he's been neglecting to really pressure the center and this results in white ending up being passive for a good while.
485,10,14,Bxe4,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb2/7p/2PpbB2/1P1P1N1P/P1Q1PPP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',After a brief think I decide I don't want that white squared bishop. I am thinking since my opponent has been playing passively that I can lock up the center and then my knights will be more useful to me if I can keep things locked up. And that is what happens. This is why over the board chess when one has time to understand what one's opponent's playing style is has the psychological aspect that online blitz chess lacks.
486,10,15,e5,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p2b2/4p2p/2PpPB2/1P3N1P/P1Q1PPP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',And thus my dark-squared bishop has become 'bad'... but later it will be of use.
487,10,16,1Bh2,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/2p2b2/4p2p/2PpP3/1P3N1P/P1Q1PPPB/R3KB1R b KQkq -',After the game white decided Bh2 was a critical mistake. Better was Bd2. Fritz agrees somewhat. That particular bishop ends up missing out on most of the action in effect white plays much of the game a piece down. Nearly two pieces down because his other bishop is a really bad bishop! At least my 'bad' bishop is not as bad as his as you'll see later. Here it's possible because of ...h5 white thinks I'll castle queenside and thus is trying to keep the bishop on that diagonal. But he's also mishandled the whole flank thingy. You're supposed to pressure the center from a distance and I get to advance my pawns with tempo due to the way he played.
488,10,17,1c5,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1pp1/5b2/2p1p2p/2PpP3/1P3N1P/P1Q1PPPB/R3KB1R w KQkq -',And now I'll try to keep this board as locked up as I can.
489,10,18,1e3,b'r2qk2r/pp1nnpp1/5b2/2p1p2p/2PpP3/1P1QPN1P/P4PPB/R3KB1R b KQkq -',The game is still equal according to Fritz. But here I soon make a couple of minor miscues.
490,10,19,1exd4,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2n2b2/2p1p2p/2PPP3/1P1Q1N1P/P4PPB/R3KB1R b KQkq -',First however my opponent thinks to get rid of the doubled pawn. Is that a good choice? Fritz thinks it was better to keep the tension.
491,10,20,1Qa5+,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2n2b2/q1p1p2p/2PPP3/1P1Q1N1P/P4PPB/R3KB1R w KQkq -',And I make an inaccuracy by lazy thinking in this game at this point. My thinking here is I want the knight on f3 to move and I hope to provoke this. But I failed to realize that white can force a queen trade here and since I've equalized and gotten the initiative pretty much by white's passive play I definitely ought to keep queens on the board at this point.
492,10,21,1Qd2,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2n2b2/q1p1p2p/2PPP3/1P3N1P/P2Q1PPB/R3KB1R b KQkq -',And after this I realize I must trade queens. Ergo the queens come off.
493,10,22,1Nxd2,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2n2b2/2p1p2p/2PPP3/1P5P/P2N1PPB/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Taking with the king is a possibility if white decides not to castle at all. I haven't castled yet either. I see no imminent threat in this position to warrant it.
494,10,23,1Nxd4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/5b2/2p1p2p/2PnP3/1P5P/P2N1PPB/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Taking with the c pawn would have given me a passed pawn. But... it will be harder for my opponent to get to d5 so for a good while this open file will then be mine to control as I feel like at least with the current position and for some time. Plus I am trying to tie white up having to defend; so white decides to try a different idea shortly.
495,10,24,1Bd3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/5b2/2p1p2p/2PnP3/1P1B3P/P2N1PPB/R3K2R b KQkq -',Stopping Nc2 and at least getting that glorified pawn out. Oh which is also the sad state for my bishop on f6. For the time being.
496,10,25,1g5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/5b2/2p1p1pp/2PnP3/1P1B3P/P2N1PPB/R3K2R w KQkq g6',Fritz doesn't like this but I'm considering a plan. I can still castle safely on the queenside if I choose or simply step into e7; but if I turn the tables on white and storm his kingside castling kingside for white would not be as comfortable. So that is what I'm considering here. A problem for black is my rooks are not yet positioned right and my knights will need to do a good amount of maneuvering. At the same time if play needs to happen on the queenside then my king will be somewhat safer if I can maintain a closed center. We'll see.
497,10,26,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/5b2/2p1p1pp/2PnP3/1P1B1N1P/P4PPB/R3K2R b KQkq -',With this move white changes all my plans. Remember how earlier I wanted that knight gone from there? It's because of the plan I wished to try which in retrospect would have been difficult to make work. But now he puts it back and it suddenly dawns on me: doh! He has basically thrown a monkey wrench at himself; a new plan suggests itself to me and I jump on it. Immediately you can see the problem here for white; those are not the pawns he wants to have doubled and so I immediately make them doubled because I see what it will do to his dark-squared bishop.
498,10,27,h4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/5b2/2p1p1p1/2P1P2p/1P1B1P1P/P4P1B/R3K2R w KQkq -',Now my kingside pawns are going to do their best to keep that dark-squared white bishop out of the action. And at this point of the game I believe I'm better. Fritz doesn't care for what I just did however; he wanted ...Nf8 instead. Which eventually I do; but white is stuck with a real mess with an imprisoned bishop that will just take too many tempos to free. And of our two bad bishops his is less active than mine...
499,10,28,2a3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/5b2/2p1p1p1/2P1P2p/PP1B1P1P/5P1B/R3K2R b KQkq -',In this position I'm not sure what white can try. White decides to try to find play on the queenside.
500,10,29,2Kd2,b'r6r/1p1nkp2/5b2/p1p1p1p1/2P1P2p/PP1B1P1P/3K1P1B/R6R b - -',With this move white admits his 22. Ke2 was a bit thoughtless. He thinks to bring his king to the queenside but his plans are sooooooo slow. And Fritz agrees not liking this white plan. Here I take a little time to assess and discover that the queenside is perfectly fine. But I wish to get my knight to d4; and to get my h rook into the action while keeping my a rook protected. I'm not ready to try any break anywhere yet until that knight gets to that annoying for white d4 square. So let's get that done...
501,10,30,2b4,b'r2r4/1p2kp2/4nb2/p1p1p1p1/1PP1P2p/P1KB1P1P/5P1B/R2R4 b - -',And here I miss an opportunity. I failed to look completely earlier at what will happen on b4. We could have 26. ...axb4 27. axb4 Rxa1 28. Rxa1 cxb4+ and the king can recapture but the bishop is hanging; no matter what white does black will win one of the white bishops: if 29. Kc2 Nd4+ and if Kd2 Nxf3+ and the h2 bishop falls; if Kd1 both bishop are attacked after Nxf3. Or if 29. Kd2 then Nc5 and the d3 bishop falls. To prevent this white could move 27. Kb2; but white's problems continue and black will likely still win a bishop. I however had stopped thinking tactically momentarily here deciding that nothing critical was going on a few moves before. Lesson learned: things change. I can see I'll have to look further ahead in my games at the tactics available.
502,10,31,2b6,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p2nb2/p1p1p1p1/1PP1P2p/P1KB1P1P/5P1B/R2R4 w - -',So instead I simply move b6. In future positions with similarities like the e6 knight and d8 rook I'll be remembering...
503,10,32,Nd4,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p3b2/p1p1p1p1/1PPnP2p/P1KB1P1P/5P1B/RR6 w - -',And finally the pressure gets to my opponent. Both his bishops are not doing much and he's nearly desperate for something to do. The game could still end up a draw even here;  but he chooses now to fight for activity and doesn't quite get it right. His next few moves are designed to wrest control of the a or perhaps b file and free up the position a bit. Again there are tactics for me and this time they're much more obvious and disastrous for white.
504,10,33,exf4,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p3b2/p1p3p1/1PPnPp1p/P1KB3P/5P1B/RR6 w - -',Keeping the g file from opening up and continuing the restriction on that dark-squared bishop. White's 28. f4 is the blunder that loses him the game.
505,10,34,Bxe5,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p6/p1p1b1p1/1PPn1p1p/P1KB3P/5P1B/RR6 w - -',So he throws away two pawns in an attempt to open the position. He fails to get the compensation he was looking for however. My f7 pawn will happily support that e5 bishop if needed.
506,10,35,3Be4,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p6/p1p1b1p1/1PPnBp1p/P1K4P/5P1B/RR6 b - -',This changed the game even more badly for white. Here I had a bit of a think looking several moves ahead. It's the same principle tactically but much more obvious and much worse for white. So obvious I think everyone here will after some thought see what to do in this position as black.
507,10,36,Ne2+,b'r2r4/4kp2/1p6/2p1b1p1/1PP1Bp1p/2K4P/4nP1B/RR6 w - -',Ne2+! I hesitate to give it an exclamation mark because it's so dratted obvious. But this combination wins for black. White plays on but the outcome is now well in hand.
508,10,37,Rb2+,b'8/4kp2/8/2p3p1/2PbBp1p/5P1P/1r1Kn2B/8 w - -',And that is how far ahead I looked when he threatened my rook with his bishop; no further than this. Although I thought he'd go after my knight necessitating Nc3 and saving his f pawn that way before my rook would get down there.
509,10,38,3Kd1,b'8/4kp2/8/2p3p1/2PbBp1p/5P1P/1r2n2B/3K4 b - -',White played knowing this was lost. He had one more trick to try.
510,10,39,4Bg6,b'8/4kp2/6B1/2p3p1/2Pb1p1p/2n2P1P/7r/2K5 b - -',Ignore those impulses to capture material and look at the board. You'll be glad you did. Nice try by white to get a stalemate!
511,10,40,4Be3#,b'8/4kp2/6B1/2p3p1/2P2p1p/2n1bP1P/7r/2K5 w - -',My first game I was white against a Sicilian and although that opponent understood the positions pretty well he too was a little tentative and I prevailed. My last game was a real hard fought battle because I blundered in the opening... a trap I knew well and immediately after I moved I was mad at myself. I played some crazy chess against a very strong player in that one and managed to fight back to a draw where I had the stronger position but I was worn out. I lucked out in that he was just a little too comfortable in the knowledge he had a winning position! And he did too. But a small inaccuracy and a little passivity and I was able to  offer the draw on move 45 in that one. People may joke about it but seriously; after that game I literally had a headache from thinking so hard! If anything that game taught me that I'm not as good as I'd like to be... and hope you've enjoyed this one. Comments welcome!

There seems to be quite a lot of interest in K & P endings lately both in Ion's Mentoring Group I and in an unrated consultation game in a Club which Bigpeta is running which I Joanne Stevens and a few other sub-2000 players have been gathering ideas on how to deal with such endings.  Our opponent is Coach Ion!  So I have just played out this ending against an Expert and come off worse and ended up getting a lesson in how not to play K & P endings.  The first lesson I was given was in this game many years ago on gameknot: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  At least I did not have doubled pawns on one side of the board and a pawn minority on the other like I did in that game but a really strange quirk led to Natalia crowning a pawn two moves before I did and eventually I copped Old Matey.  So how did all this happen?  Well read on ......"

Although this is an f pawn the game is up for me because there are other pawns on the board and so the stalemate saviour is not available for me here so it is a loss like any other pawn on the 7th rank v Q ending.

However it does over-protect e4 allowing the Nc3 to contemplate occupying d5 (or swinging via a4) to threaten b6.  In the past I've often suffered from White exploiting the hole at b6 with B and N.
1021,22,8,Qe2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Unexpected.  I'm not sure of the point of this move other than to over-populate the e-file.  Moving the Q off the back row allows castling either side to keep Black guessing and this possibly supports Bc4 but it is more usual in the English Attack to back the other B from d2.

Kingside castling would have played into the hands of the expected pawn storm.  Queenside didn't look much safer given the flexible central deployment of all White's minor pieces.  It goes against opening principles to move this pawn twice before I've castled but there are good concrete reasons to do so: it frees up Black's position getting rid of the weak backward pawn which is not currently required to defend e5 and threatens to fork the Nc3 and Be3 with a bind on White's position.  White is in no better position than Black to attack the uncastled King.

This is also a much better square for the N than the originally planned retreat square at d7 as it dominates the board whence the N can either swap with one of White's minor pieces or move again to threaten mayhem on white's second rank.

At this stage my opponent had 61 minutes left I had 69.  By the end of the game he had 3 and I had 40.

1169,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I always open with e4 as I'm relatively new to OTB chess and I'm trying to play the same opening enough that I'm comfortable with it. I usually play into the Italian game if I can.

I spent a little bit of time looking at what should come next if ..dxe4 Nxe4 and then if ..Bf5 Ng3 seems to save the tempo by forcing the bishop to retreat plus g3 seems like a reasonable square for the knight. As it happens this is exactly the line taken over the next few moves.
1174,26,5,Ng3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',As previously described.
1175,26,6,Bg6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Makes sense keeping blacks only developed piece on the board on a fairly good diagonal where my queen is tied to defending the c2 pawn.
1176,26,7,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/2BP4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Just a developing move really also with the advantage of pointing at the weak f7 square. I also looked at Nf3 but this felt a bit more direct.
1177,26,8,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/2BP4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Well there goes the threat on f7. Also d5 looks like a nice outpost for a knight if black can maneuver his way there.
1178,26,9,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/2BP4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Developing and again protecting d4 to give the queen the scope to move a bit. In hindsight I feel maybe Nge2 was a better move as this would have made it easier for my DSB to emerge later in the game. I looked at this at the time but felt I shouldn't block the half open e-file.
1179,26,10,h6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p1bp/8/2BP4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I guess this is to keep the bishop on because if white plays Ne5 I can force the bishop off for a knight.
1180,26,11,O-O,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p1bp/8/2BP4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Castling seemed reasonable at this point with no immediate threats or tactical opportunities that I noticed.
1181,26,12,c3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnbp/8/2BP4/2P2NN1/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Mainly played this to free up the queen that was tied to the defence of c2 this also allows the queen and f3 knight the opportunity to go elsewhere should the need arise Qb3 as a follow up looked interesting although the response ..b5 makes life a bit awkward after that.
1182,26,13,1Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1pnbp/4N3/2BP4/2P3N1/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',e5 looked like a nice outpost for the knight. Ne5 played mainly with a view to forcing the bishop to give up the nice diagonal it has it has no retreat squares other than h7 which isn't all that great.
1183,26,14,1Bh7,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppb/2p1pn1p/4N3/2BP4/2P3N1/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black tries to hold onto the bishop.

Black can play Bg8 (terrible place for the bishop) or g6 to keep the bishop but neither looks enticing.
1185,26,16,1Qxd3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/3P4/2PQ2N1/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Retaking with the queen in order to bring another piece out.

1187,26,18,1Nf3,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P4/2PQ1NN1/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',"I spent a long time here looking at something like Ng6 threatening the rook or taking the black DSB off. If fxg6 then Qxg6 check with a follow up of Nh5 threatening mate on g7. Black is defending h5 though so could exchange and Bxh6 didn't seem to help either. I came to the conclusion that there was no combination on here so gave up on that idea after running a few minutes off my clock!

I considered that the threat of a later Ne5 may come in useful so opted to retreat for now."
1188,26,19,1c5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/2p5/3P4/2PQ1NN1/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black challenges the d4 pawn.

I was trying to maximise my control on the white squares also with black having no LSB so keep my queen on the diagonal.
1190,26,21,1Rc8,b'2rqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/2p5/3P4/2P2NN1/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w k -',This is quite a clever move in my opinion as black can create a new pin on the c3 pawn shortly.
1191,26,22,1h3,b'2rqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/2p5/3P4/2P2NNP/PPQ2PP1/R1B2RK1 b k -',I'd looked at a few options here particularly with a view to getting the DSB out (neither it or the a1 rook have moved all game) but I was concerned about ..Ng4 had I played Be3. So this move was really to restrict the options of the f6 knight.
1192,26,23,1Nxd4,b'2rqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PPQ2PP1/R1B2RK1 b k -',Retaking with the knight as clearly cxd4 is a bad idea.
1193,26,24,1Nb6,b'2rqk2r/pp2bpp1/1n2pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PPQ2PP1/R1B2RK1 w k -',The black knight becomes a bit more active plus with the c3 pawn pinned to the queen my d4 knight is hanging.
1194,26,25,1Rd1,b'2rqk2r/pp2bpp1/1n2pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PPQ2PP1/R1BR2K1 b k -',This move both defend the knight and presents a tactical threat - if white could play Nxe6 from this position he wins a pawn and the queen for the rook and knight.
1195,26,26,1Nbd7,b'2rqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PPQ2PP1/R1BR2K1 w k -',Black sees the threat and retreats the knight. He offered me a draw at this point - the game did seem even to me however with us needing to win both games to salvage a draw from the match and there still being some chess to be played from here I decided to play on.
1196,26,27,1Qb3,b'2rqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/8/3N4/1QP3NP/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 b k -',Threatening the b7 pawn - I wasn't terribly happy with this move but I'd spent a lot of time over the last few moves and didn't want to get into time trouble and couldn't see a lot wrong with this. it at least removes the pin from the c3 pawn as well.
1197,26,28,1Qb6,b'2r1k2r/pp1nbpp1/1q2pn1p/8/3N4/1QP3NP/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 w k -',Offering the exchange. I felt a bit like black was playing for a draw from here as he was quite exchange happy.

1199,26,30,1Qxb5,b'2r1k2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/1q6/3N4/2P3NP/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 w k -',Black takes the exchange.

1202,26,33,2Nd4,b'2r1k2r/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PP3PP1/R1BR2K1 b k -',I guess Nd6+ was an option here that I missed at the time forcing black to exchange bishop for knight that might have been better than what I actually played. Again I wasn't doing too well for time so played fairly quickly from here (more time is added after move 30).
1203,26,34,2Bd2,b'2r2rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/8/3N4/2P3NP/PP1B1PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Finally after 22 moves the DSB leaves it's home square I had been very conscious of it's lack of involvement so far (and the blocking in of the a1 rook) I moved it here as I also wanted to advance my Q-side pawns to light squares so they don't become a weakness in view of only dark squared bishops being left on the board.
1204,26,35,2b3,b'2r2rk1/1p2bpp1/p3pn1p/2n5/3N4/1PP3NP/P2B1PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',I begin the planned advance.

1214,26,45,3Kf1,b'6k1/1p1rbpp1/p3p2p/8/2P5/1P3N1P/P4PP1/R4K2 b - -',The king moves over with the idea of controlling d2 after Ke1 or Ke2. Obviously the black rook getting to d2 would be a major problem. I couldn't see any way for black to force the issue nor for white to mount an effective attack from here. The other game had ended in a draw by now so the match was already lost with this in mind I offered a draw here and black accepted.

It is probable that with perfect play black could have engineered at least a draw.  Hopefully we will identify where things went off track.

I see Black's idea though: he wants to cut off my knight from the flight square g5 in the case of a future e4 push and to take away the g5 square from my dark-squared bishop. But then again the dark squared bishop is not used early in the game in the King's Indian Attack.

My bet on this opening is that white has to get the bishop out ONLY when it represents a real threat to black. I can see no difference in white's position after Bd3. I don't want to castle kinside. Even after Qc2 the check in h7 (alone) is not a threat so there's no need to waste time when other moves like the text can make the opponent stop and think?

But the idea behind this move is to become active on the queenside - the right strategy for black given the position. But this reflects c6 as a waste of time. Black will pay for it.

White can follow his original plan and just play h4 to g5 etc. The text move opens a tactic line if c4: Nc5. Then black has to calculate if he can safely take the c pawn with BxN or kick the Knight with b6. I'm not sure at all that white will get advantage from any of those lines. So my move deserves a ?.

This is not so simple you see: black can try e5 and white can't take it or the rook's action on the f column will become dangerous. Anyway black - who was obviously putting all his hopes in the knight sac on c3 saw the chance to play it - since the white queen is not covering it anymore.

White can even think about castling kingside now but this is not my style! Now you see I can defend the bishop putting it on e7. As long as the knight stays in g6 (and I don't see how black can get rid of it safely in a couple of moves. the bishop is safe. But I want to attack. Besides: black has f5! and e5!

Sometimes I am glad when in a blitz I can ""sense"" (more than actually calculate) these things. 
On the other side I didn't realize during the game that I was actually up in material. I completely overlooked it and I played just looking for the best move and no mistakes... as if we were even. "

1565,35,31,2f5,b'rnR5/pp2qkpQ/4p2p/5p2/3P2P1/1N5P/PP3P2/4K2R w K -',...opening a square for the king. The question is: has white a forced mate or will he win by force many more moves ahead? White has plenty of choices including Nc5. White must not take the pawn carelessly or exf5+ will cause unnecessary weakness in white's position.

If fxg4 hxg4 and I can bet is mate in few moves (I's check with the puzzle maker if I have a spare time). Black has a mate threat to defend. Qf5 is impossible due to Qxg7 so...
1572,35,38,2g6,b'rn3Q2/ppq5/4R1pp/5pk1/3P2P1/1N5P/PP3P2/4K2R w K -',The only way I can see. White has plenty of moves here but still which is better? 
1573,35,39,2h4+,b'rn3Q2/ppq5/4R1pp/5pk1/3P2PP/1N6/PP3P2/4K2R b K -',The alternative was gxf5. This is an almost trapped king and it's a pity white can't play f3. 
1574,35,40,2Kf4,b'rn3Q2/ppq5/4R1pp/5p2/3P1kPP/1N6/PP3P2/4K2R w K -',Again better than Kxg4 or I think so since I can't see any defence against Rxg6+.

1579,35,45,3Rh3,b'rn3Q2/pp6/6Rp/2Nq1p2/3P1kPP/7R/PP3P2/4K3 b - -',Further restricting black's king movements. Black can't go Qg2 or Qxf5#.

My plan is to force the black king on the h column and play with the rook's mate threat. The whole Re7 thing will be useful ""in order to have the tempo to play Rg7 once the black king is in the h column. Moreover: I don't have to care for my h pawn. Actually I must welcome black for taking it provided I can play Rg7 safely on the next move."" By playing right now the rook to g6 with the same purpose is pointless since the black king can escape to e4 d4 etc. "

The problem is that from there the bishop blocks the only place for the rook to defend c2. White can't afford to lose a second pawn without a sound compensation. After 27. Bg3 black has Rf3 and white is forced to 28. Rd3. Black misses a tempo to play Ba3 and seriously threat mate. It was dangerous but it was the only choice for white.
