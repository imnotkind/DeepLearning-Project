0,0,0,Bb2,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P2b1/1P2PN2/PBP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I've been experimenting with the Zukertort-type setup.
1,0,1,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/2nbp3/3pN3/3P1P2/1P2P3/PBPNQ1PP/R4RK1 b - f3',This was probably a mistake.  I think Nxc6 was better here giving Black an isolated a-pawn.  I could have followed with f4 if desired or also Nf3.
2,0,2,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/PP2P3/1BPNQ1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Black's N is largely out of play but White has little ability to generate a Kingside attack.
3,0,3,1Rf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n1p3/3pPp2/3P4/PP2PR2/1BPNQ1PP/R5K1 b - -',I think exf6 e.p. would have given White better attacking chances.
4,0,4,1Rh3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1n1p3/3pPp2/3P3b/PP2P2R/1BPNQ1PP/5RK1 b - -',The R is horribly misplaced here and takes forever to get back into play.
5,0,5,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp4p/p1n1p1p1/3pPp2/2PP3b/PP2P2R/1B1NQ1PP/5RK1 b - c3',This diversion is way to early.  I should figure out how to get a grip on the c-file first if I am going to open it up.
6,0,6,Rxd5,b'r5k1/1pp1b2p/p1n1p1p1/3rPp2/3P4/PP2PN1R/1B4PP/5RK1 w - -',White has traded into a terrible position.  Nf3 has no good squares.  Rh3 is virtually out of play.  Bb2 has a blocked diagonal and no scope.  Black's pieces are much better.
7,0,7,2Rc1,b'r5k1/2p1b2p/p1n1p1p1/1p1rPp2/3P4/PP2P2R/1B1N2PP/2R3K1 b - -',This is the only useful diagonal.
8,0,8,2Nxe5,b'r5k1/2p1b2p/p3p1p1/1p1rnp2/3P4/PP2P2R/1B1N2PP/2R3K1 w - -',This was a nice tactical shot that I actually missed.  If White plays dxe5 Black plays Rxd2 with tempo.
9,0,9,2Rc2,b'4r1k1/3rb2p/p3p1p1/1p2np2/3PP3/PP5R/1BRN2PP/6K1 b - -',This might not have been best either.  Rxd7 Nxd7 Rc3 would have seized the file anyway.
10,0,10,3a4,b'4r1k1/3rb2p/p3p1p1/4Pp2/Pp1P4/1P3R2/1BR1K1PP/8 b - -',Now the position is blocked up.  No one has much play.
11,0,11,3Rdc6,b'3b2k1/3rr2p/2R1p1p1/p3Pp2/Pp1P4/1P6/1B2K1PP/2R5 b - -',Draw was agreed.  
12,1,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This was played against me in my second game against reversion so I decided to try it out since he recommended that I try different openings.
13,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So Terence develops whilst threatens my pawn.
14,1,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',So I defend by developing.
15,1,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Likewise he continues with his development.
16,1,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',As do I and I also prepare to castle.  After this Terence will knab my pawn and I'll take back.  Knowing that taking is not a mistake here I felt pretty good about the position.  But after studying those blitz Q sacs from tactical-abyss I'm not going to get too comfortable.  That's because anything can change so one cannot let their guard down.
17,1,5,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',That's because the piece is not won with this move.  In fact I saw this fork and asked myself what to do.  In the end I decided to give him my N as I'd get a pawn since his N was pinned.  If I gave him my B there's no pin so I'd wind up behind as opposed to level.
18,1,6,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"?? But there was a better move that would've put me ahead and I did not see it.  So Terence implied that this is the losing blunder by saying ""Jkarp have you ever seen this line by black before. The correct move is 6. Bd3 regaining the piece.""  And I said that is a problem as I have not.  The reason for not playing was that I didn't want to block my center pawn but had no idea that I could get a piece from that."
19,1,7,Qg5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B2N1q1/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Threatening my N.  So I decide to exchange in order to avoid losing my N.  I was hesitant but realize that there's no alternative.  And I have to take with the B.  Now I had considered 8.Nxc6 with the idea of 8...bxc6 9.Bxc6+ to win that Rook.  But after thinking about what Jack Stockel emphasized 10 days ago combined with it being a weakness I realized that it was a mistake.  Therefore I asked myself what Jack said of why Terence would do that.  Turns out that he would not because if I played 8.Nxc6 8...Qxg2 immediately follows.  And if I try a discover check then ...Bd7! would immediately win a piece.  Either my Bb5 or Ne5 which I didn't want to allow.  So I decided that an immediate check was best.  I'm still going down a pawn but it's better then losing a piece.
20,1,8,1Rf1,b'r1b1kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p3/8/PPPP1PqP/R1BQKR2 b Qkq -',But at least my Rook is defended.  However this is no time to party as we're about to see.
21,1,9,1Bg4,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p1b1/8/PPPP1PqP/R1BQKR2 w Qkq -',I started doing it here since Terence did not take the pawn.  But I'm in a lot of trouble.  Trying to see multiple variations after what Ken taught me I still missed too many for my own game so now was not the time to celebrate as I'm about to see.
22,1,10,1f3,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p1b1/5P2/PPPP2qP/R1BQKR2 b Qkq -',The reason however for me celebrating was that I remembered what Ken told me about certain move.  So I thought yes the danger is over and I'm now safe.  That's because this appears to protect my B.  But what I overlooked though is what happens after he takes with my pawn.  I knew he would but missed the entire story that the board was trying to indicate just like I did with bhidragon.  As it turns out when all is said and done Terence is going to have unstoppable passed pawn which is what I missed in all of the variations.
23,1,11,1Bxf3,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p3/5b2/PPPP2qP/R1BQKR2 w Qkq -',As now I have no choice but to give my R for B.  Had I known the full extent of where I was I would've resigned right here.  But not knowing that I take because after he took back I thought that aside from being an equivalent to a piece down I'm allright.  But that isn't so here.
24,1,12,exf3,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/8/5p2/PPPP2qP/R1BQK3 w Qkq -',And that's because of this passed pawn.  At the very least Terence is going to be a Queen up on top of what he's already won.  Knowing that this where I figured out that there was nothing else to learn and thus resigned here.  What it comes to show is that it only takes one bad move to mess up the entire game as it did here.
25,2,0,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq c6',I consider this to be the best for black. 
26,2,1,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',My preferred line. Giving up c4 saves white from a lot of troubles since I'm planning to castle queenside.
27,2,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',As black I would go for cxd5 for sure but for some reason nobody plays it. I know there is a lot of theory behind...
28,2,3,e3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now I am so solid...

30,2,5,Qb3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qn1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/1QP1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',b3 or Qc2 where options. In case of QxQ axQ and if c5 I'll go QxQ axQ Bc7 and if g6 b3  compensates... maybe.
31,2,6,Qa5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/q1pp4/3P1B2/1QP1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Interesting choice. Now c5 is annoying. 
32,2,7,Qb5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/qQpp4/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I thought Bb5 didn't work because of c5! BxN+ bxB and my Q needs to retire. If c5! Qa4  QxQ BxQ Bd7 and black is safe I got nothing out of all this. 
33,2,8,Bd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n1pn2/qQpp4/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',"I was blinded thinking that Qxb7 was ""poisoned"". Not really because of the dsb... I still thought it was risky so I went for the ugly..."

36,2,11,Bd6,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/n2pN3/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Well... Nxf7 comes to mind and if BxB NxR. But this N will be a goner and I'll have no compensation for the exchange.
37,2,12,1Nxd7,b'r3k2r/pp1N1ppp/3bpn2/n2p4/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',...but this is different. Now I have NxN+ so black has to take defending his lsb
38,2,13,1Bb5+,b'r6r/pp1k1ppp/3bpn2/nB1p4/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I wish his N was not there but I couldn't see a force able to pevent him putting it there. Now I think maybe Bd3 was more on the idea answering Bf5+ if ever e5 was attempted.

107,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Typical opening.
108,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I answer with the Sicilian Defense.
109,3,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I haven't see this played against the Sicilian.
110,3,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So I play this in an attempt to break open the center.
111,3,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I guess that white has the same idea in mind.
112,3,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This was played to prevent his e5 from advancing any further.
113,3,6,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So he attempts to exchange in which I exchange.
114,3,7,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I decide to start developing at once.  I'm also keeping that I'll be able to find a better outpost for this N since it's about getting your pieces to better squares as I learned from Ken.
115,3,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Meanwhile he develops.
116,3,9,Nec6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile I get my N to a better place at once to prevent a check with his next move.  Afterall I'm in no rush to develop my Q side yet because of what's coming.
117,3,10,Bb5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1B1pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',That however does not stop white from pinning my Nc6.

Exchanging isn't my plan.  But I don't care if he does and more then happy to allow it because his Bb5 was more active.  By enabling this exchange I feel that I've got an edge.
125,3,18,1a3,b'rn3rk1/pp1qbppp/4p3/3pP3/1n1P4/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Kicking my N which I protect.  I don't know what his plan is until 13.Qc2 is played.
126,3,19,f6,b'rn3rk1/pp1qb1pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',That's when I figured out that he was trying to put an overwhelming pressure against my K side.  A N B and the Q all working together on the K side tells me an important.  Which is that he's got threats that could be overwhelming if I'm not careful.  So to prevent that kind of nonsense I play this.  I'm also keeping in mind that he intends to exchange pawns which I'm not afraid since that's not part of the overall picture.
127,3,20,1Qd3,b'rn3rk1/pp1q2pp/2n1pb2/3p4/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Still appears to be going for some kind of threat.
128,3,21,1Ne7,b'rn3rk1/pp1qn1pp/4pb2/3p4/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I stop him in case my instincts are right.  In addition this enables me to complete my development.
129,3,22,1Rae1,b'rn3rk1/pp1qn1pp/4pb2/3p4/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',So Tinley centralizes his Rook.
130,3,23,1Nbc6,b'r4rk1/pp1qn1pp/2n1pb2/3p4/3P4/P1NQBN2/1P3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',And that enables me to complete my development.  Now I'm going for other ideas.
131,3,24,1Bg5,b'r4rk1/pp1qn1pp/2n1pb2/3p2B1/3P4/P1NQ1N2/1P3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',He attempts to exchange Bishops.  I give it as a mistake since my Bf6 is less active.  And I don't have a choice anyway.  But I did I'd willing do it anyhow.  The only problem is that I forgot about his Nf3 which is more active then his B.  However unlike my game with Ken it does not bother me because if he tries to do something about it I'll stop it.  And despite what's happening I'm feeling more and more confident about the position.  Normally that's not the way to go as I learned in that training game but it pait off here as that's what helped me to get a draw when all was said and done.
132,3,25,Rf5,b'r5k1/pp1qn1pp/2n1p3/3p1rN1/3P4/P1NQ4/1P3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',? Knowing that and feeling like he might try to do something I kick Til's Knight.  What I forgot is that this move is going to cost me a pawn.  Much better was 18...e5.
133,3,26,Rh5,b'r5k1/pp1qn1pp/2n1N3/3p3r/3P4/P1NQ4/1P3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Despite what's happening I feel that I just might be able to do something if he makes a mistake.  At the very front of my mind is what happened in my game against bhidragon so I decide to go for it by attacking his K side.  I'm treating it as though 19...Qh5 is possible but am using my Rook instead and for the same reason.  
134,3,27,2Qg3,b'r5k1/pp1qn1pp/2n1N3/3p3r/3P4/P1N3Q1/1P3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Trying to mate me.  But after what happened in our last game I'm very well aware of this threat and punish him by kicking Til's Queen on my next move.
135,3,28,Qd6,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2nqN3/3p1n1r/3P4/P1NQ4/1P3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',So I put a squeeze with a mate threat of my own.  Not to my surprise Tel stops it but not without putting compromises on his monarch which I'll try to take advantage since he opened up right near the King.
136,3,29,Rg5,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2nqN3/3p1nr1/3P4/P1NQ2P1/1P3P1P/4RRK1 w - -',So I add an attacking force.  After what happened with Joann and Jack Stockel followed by Reuben I'm attempting to pin his g3 by adding an attacker then after against his monarch.  It does work this time around.
137,3,30,2Re2,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2nq4/3p2r1/3P1N1n/P1NQ2P1/1P2RP1P/5RK1 b - -',? I'm not sure why he played it but it's a mistake as I'll get a pawn for free.  Because if he takes back 25...Nf3+ forks and wins the Queen.
138,3,31,2Nb5,b'r5k1/pp4pp/3q4/1N1p2r1/3n1N1n/P2Q2P1/1P2RP1P/5RK1 b - -',So he prevents that by playing this.  Therefore I take his Rook and place him in check.  When he takes back I'm now ahead.  A little bit down the road though I made a mistake that should've given him the advantage.  Therefore it's far from over.  
139,3,32,Qh6,b'r5k1/pp4pp/7q/1N1p2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/5RK1 w - -',As now I add an attacking force.  The plan is 27...Nf3+ which would allow 28...Qxh2#.
140,3,33,2Rd1,b'r5k1/pp4pp/7q/1N1p2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/3R2K1 b - -',Knowing what I'm up to black stops that.
141,3,34,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/pp4pp/7q/1N1p2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/3R2K1 w - -',And given that I've got a passed pawn I place my Rook behind since that's where they belong.
142,3,35,2Nc7,b'3r2k1/ppN3pp/7q/3p2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/3R2K1 b - -',Going for my d pawn since it's got another attacker.
143,3,36,2Qc6,b'3r2k1/ppN3pp/2q5/3p2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/3R2K1 w - -',"This is where I start going wrong.  Similar to that terrible blunder against Jack Stockel I figured that white's Knight is now trapped and can't go anywhere.  It can and in the process he's getting back a pawn.  Best would've been 28...d4  As they say ""passed pawns must be pushed.""  And this is no exception.
"
144,3,37,Re8,b'4r1k1/pp4pp/2q5/3N2r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P2QP1P/3R2K1 w - -',With him grabbing I decide to attack his Queen.  Once he runs back I double up.  This was also played to prevent the fork with 30.Ne7+ which would win the Queen.
145,3,38,Ree5,b'6k1/pp4pp/2q5/3Nr1r1/5N1n/P5P1/1P3P1P/3R1QK1 w - -',I thought that this was initially a mistake.  I thought that I've allowed 31.Ne7+ for some reason.  However I'm still protected and should've well be in the fight longer as my back rank is still strong.  Figuring that there was no way out I played a move and was hoping for what I believed to be counterplay.  I was aiming for a draw by repetition since with the belief that there was no way out of trouble.  Had this been figuring out I would not have moved back and forth.  Instead I would've advanced my a or b pawns.  
146,3,39,3Qh3,b'6k1/pp4pp/2q5/3Nr1r1/5N1n/P5PQ/1P3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',This is where I thought that there was no way out since his Q N and R are pointing at my K.  But my backrank is strong here.  I found one move but anything loses the N or Q.  Without much alternative I took into account what Ken said by hoping that he would blunder since I was just going to go back and forth.  Therefore if he continued doing so I'd be able to get a draw which is how it happened.  Therefore kept moving the N and back and forth as white did with his Queen until a draw by repetition was achieved.
147,3,40,3Qh3,b'6k1/pp4pp/2q5/3Nr1r1/5N1n/P5PQ/1P3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Overall I'm satisfied with how the game went but not more then that.  There was certainly more then one way out of trouble.  But if it happens where I'm in a situation like this and there's pretty much no way out I'll attempt to use this same strategy since at the time I felt that I had gotten my ticket out of a bad situation.
148,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',She starts conventionally.  In fact in the recent course that I took there's another opening I learned called the London System which starts off with 1.d4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Bf4  There are other moves that go into it that but I'm alluding to the main variations and of course there are others that can transpose into this.  I also learned about the Colle's Franketort System from her which I've tried myself.  So I'm not surprised to see her play this because it appears to fit her style the best.  And Susan said in the second course to play the opening that you're most used to since there's no opening that automatically wins.
149,4,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Not my surprise it's a QGD which is how respond to the QG.
150,4,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Susan develops right away.
151,4,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So does Vladimir.
152,4,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Continuing with her development.
153,4,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This has now transposed into the Semi Slav Defense.
154,4,6,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Opening up a line to develop her Bf1 which we typically see in the Colle's System.
155,4,7,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Continuing with his development and at the same time this allows Vladimir to bring that a N to a better outpost.  Specifically to b6 sooner or later.  And if attacked it can go to a5.  Perhaps he might even decide to take on c4 which if it were playable now he'd be a pawn up.
156,4,8,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Continuing with her development.  After which Susan will exchange pawns to prevent the loss of material as I was alluding to earlier with blacks d7 when talking about better outposts.
157,4,9,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',Kicking her Bc5.  My guess is that Vladimir thinks that he's gotten a space advantage.  I say that because of something that white mentioned in the London System works which involves a bad move.  But black kicks I believe the N because he or she feels that they've gotten tempo as well as a space advantage.  In reality it becomes a blunder because of what follows.
158,4,10,Bb7,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Continuing with his development.
159,4,11,e4,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3PP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The intent is to kick the N.  But I believe that Susan is also trying to trick Vladimir into playing 9...c5 after which would come 10.e5 and when the N moves white would I believe mess up black's pawn structures by taking on c5  I say this because that's how I sometimes think.  It's not in terms of unsound aggression but I recently did something like this in a team game which worked.  After losing one game by failing to ask myself if I could be mated again (which is a basic rule) since I somehow made the board too small to analyze by pushing the wrong button I asked how I could change the outcome for the next team game.  Now I made a blunder and he could've won material.  Keeping in mind what Kenneth_fiore_3 told me towards the end of our training game combined with what happened on Friday with Jack Stockel where he yelled at me because of a terrible blunder I displayed Hope Chess.  I was just hoping that my opponent would overlook a check because one of his pawn was pinned.  Despite being +1 he almost got the advantage back by threatening to win back R for N with check.  But I was just hoping that he'd miss it by going back and forth with by repining the pawn repeatedly until we reached a draw by repetition.  Unlike with the game against Ken it worked so I felt that I learned a bit from my mistake on Friday.  Therefore I'm applying a similar concept here with Susan except that this is not Hope Chess.  But I think that white's hoping that she can take advantage of black.
160,4,12,b4,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/1p1PP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',It does not work however since Vladimir kicks the Knight.
161,4,13,1e5,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1ppp/2p1pn2/4P3/1p1P4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Likewise Susan kicks his N.  And this is already turning out to be interesting and very unusual.  In fact like the game that I pointed out in the intro both sides are going to promote which is going to leave us with 4 Queens on the board.
162,4,14,Qb1,b'r2qkb1Q/pb1n1p1p/2p1p3/8/3P4/5N2/P3BPPP/1qBQK2R w Kq -',I'm not sure why this was played but my guess is that with two Queens on the same diagnol white must have had a threat that players like me don't see.  So black responds by moving.
163,4,15,1O-O,b'r2qkb1Q/pb1n1p1p/2p1p3/8/3P4/5N2/P3BPPP/1qBQ1RK1 b q -',Which allows Susan to castle.
164,4,16,1Qf6,b'r3kb1Q/pb1n1p1p/2p1pq2/8/3P4/5N2/P3BPPP/1qBQ1RK1 w q -',Knowing how dangerous Susan's promoted pawn is Vladimir attempts to exchange.  To my surprise it works.  I say that because as white instead of 15.Qxf6 I would've played 15.Qg8 to prevent the exchange.  That's because I felt that my opponent would have no choice.  Therefore I believe that Susan feels the same way about his Queen which is why she would accept an exchange.
165,4,17,1Ne5,b'r3kb2/pb3p1p/2p1pn2/4N3/3P4/8/P3BPPP/1qBQ1RK1 b q -',Bringing her N to a better outpost.  But it's also because as I learned from bhidragon in regards to figuring the entire story that the board's telling me it appears that Susan is attempting to organize her Queen Be2 and the N on the K side which would leave black with an overwhelming attack.  It's also safe to infer based on the London System course that white's a2 is a poison pawn.  In that course there was a variation where if you took the pawn right next to it with the Queen as black you'd lose your Queen or at the very least your Rook.  And that was so important that she reiterated that in the very last chapter.  Therefore it must apply here because when Vladimir takes Susan will restrengthen her Be2 against the K side.
166,4,18,Qa5,b'r3kb2/pb3p1p/2p1pn2/q3N3/2BP4/8/5PPP/2BQ1RK1 w q -',Trying to stop an attack like that Vladimir tries to stop that by bringing his Queen to the fifth rank.
167,4,19,1Qf3,b'r3kb2/pb3p1p/2p1pn2/q3N3/2BP4/5Q2/5PPP/2B2RK1 b q -',In my opinion however it's too little too late since the f file is now weakened.  Forget about attack and tempo gain.  I think that we're dealing with a masked battery against black's King. 
168,4,20,1Be7,b'r3k3/pb2bp1p/2p1pn2/q3N3/2BP4/5Q2/5PPP/2B2RK1 w q -',I say that because of this move where Vladimir protects his Knight.  But Susan adds more pressure with her Bc1.  In doing so the N is now attacked twice.  There however is more to this story then meets the eye.  That's because when black defends again white will at the very least win a pawn.
169,4,21,fxe6,b'r2qk3/pb2b2p/2p1pn2/4N1B1/3P4/5Q2/5PPP/5RK1 w q -',?? As black now takes back.  Even though it's between much stronger players and two quieries like this are not usually in place I go by what was said on the other site.  Starting on Susan's next move Vladimir's position is lost.  So they're implying that this is losing blunder.  And after white recaptures black will also take back as Vladimir feels that he has the initiative due to being the equivalent of a pawn up.  But what I noted here is also applicable that the masked battery against the K and added pressure was a lot for black to handle which was going to make things difficult as is.
170,4,22,2Qh5+,b'r3k3/pb2b2p/2p1pB2/4N2Q/3q4/8/5PPP/5RK1 b q -',For a while I had no idea why Vladimir resigned.  Then I read those comments which explains it all.  There are three moves for black as we know.  But nothing is going to save him.  That's because he's either going to be mated or will lose his Queen without compensation.  And this is where they also implied that 20...fxe6?? was the losing blunder.  That was because it was posted that after 21.Bxf6! black's position was beyond saving because of the overwhelming attacks.  That makes sense to me believe it or not because had black tried anything else besides taking back he's down the equivalent of a piece for pawn which is not enough against someone of this strength.  In general it boils down to just one or two pawns which is how a GM wins anyhow.

298,8,3,Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/pbp2ppp/1pnppn2/8/2PPP3/2bB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black must take here when the pin is broken by castling--the Bishop can be trapped otherwise.

303,8,8,2Qc4,b'q4rk1/2p2ppp/1p1p4/2nPp3/P1Q5/8/3N1PPP/R5K1 b - -',Now there is no easy way for Black to make progress.  The c7 pawn is backward and very weak.

522,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',One of the first lessons we learn in the game of chess is to be aware - and beware - of the weakness at f7 if you're playing Black and f2 if you're playing White.  As a corollary one often also seeks to obtain an attack against that weak point in the enemy position.  That is one of the reasons for castling early but even castling is not always a secure safeguard.  Check this out.
523,16,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Bishop's Opening - an old fashioned line that doesn't get much 'air time' these days.  I like it as a good alternative to the more usual (and highly 'theoretical') 2.Nf3.  Part of its motivation is to leave the f-pawn free to advance and therefore it has certain affinities to the Vienna Opening and King's Gambit.  According to IM Bill Hartston though 'Black has several possibilities for creating such diversions that White has no time for P-KB4 [f4]'.  In my view that is no especial hardship...
524,16,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',The usual response and my favourite when playing Black against this line.  Develops and strikes at once against the unprotected e4-pawn.
525,16,3,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"And this is the more usual response by White.  To be sure it's a pawn move but White is now able to develop rapidly.  Also possible is 3.Nc3 but that doesn't necessarily stop 3...Nxe4!? (4.Nxe4 d5! 5.Bxd5 Qxd5 when White should probably protect the knight by 6.d3 rather than move it {...Qxg2}; or 4.Bxf7ch Kxf7 5.Nxe4 d5).  Of course White has a third option after 3.Nc3 Nxe4 and that is 4.Qh5! ... when things can get really wild and woolly.  Black should probably reply 4...Nd6 in response to the Queen sortie defending f7 and attacking the c4-bishop at the same time.
"
526,16,4,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',[!?] More usual are 3...Nc6 (developing) or 3...c6 (preparing the ...d5 break).  With this move Black seems to be prepared to transpose into a Giuoco Pianissimo or a line in the King's Gambit Declined: 4.Nc3 Nc6  5.f4!?  Note that 3...d5 is far too premature opening up the position  before Black is really ready to make use of the opened lines e.g. 3...d5(?) 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 9.0-0 Be7 10.Re1 ... when White bids fair to develop a dangerous initiative.  So long as White makes purposeful developing moves Black should be wary - and chary - of opening up the centre too soon. 
527,16,5,h3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',[?!]  Prophylaxis:  White wants to obviate any threats against f2 before they develop.  There are two downsides to this.  First it really doesn't push White's development along.  The second alludes to my previous comment.  After this Black felt it reasonable to try the ...d5 break - thematic in this opening.  This wee pawn move was really unnecessary as 4.Nf3 Ng4(?)  5.0-0 ... would have afforded sufficient protection for f2.
528,16,6,d5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpp3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',[!?] I find this move very difficult to call.  Personally I would have been more inclined to prepare ...d5 by playing ...c6 beforehand so as to recapture with the pawn upon White's exchanging on d5: 4...c6  5.Nf3 d5  6.exd5 cxd5 and if 7.Bb5ch Bd7! gives White no time to to take the pawn on e5.  Having said that there is no reason for a developing player not to explore the likely consequences of an early central break like this.  It doesn't give away too much.
529,16,7,Qh5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bnp2Q/2B5/3P3P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',[!?]  Putting the frighteners on?  Although I would certainly have been eyeing this move I would equally well have been trying to work out the most propitious moment for playing it.  It seems just a trifle premature here with too little heft behind it no real targets ahead and prior to castling too.  You might object that a couple of moves back Qh5 came into serious consideration in a sideline to the text (the 'text' being the actual score - moves - of the game).  But in that case there was a target that Black would have been more stretched to protect.  But here we are in the realm of risk-taking and there is no harm in that and a good deal to be learned.
530,16,8,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/2bnp2Q/2B5/3P3P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',Good defence.  The e-pawn is safe enough as 7.Qxe5?? Re8 and Black wins the major exchange: Queen for Rook.

Possibly 7...Nc6 would have been a trifle better but I would not criticise this move at all!  Apart from anything else it shows flexibility of mind.
533,16,11,Qh4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B4Q/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The e-pawn is taboo of course and White wants to keep the g5-square open if possible.

Better it seems to me would have been 8...Nc6 continuing to mobilize rapidly.

A good move here would have been 9...Be6 covering f7 and offering to exchange bishops.  Also playable were 9...Nc6 (10.Ng5 Rf8) and even 9...h6 which for the price of a slight weakening of the K-side keeps the knight out of g5.  After the text move White has an edge but the game is becoming very lively.

538,16,16,1e3,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/2b3N1/2B4Q/3Pp2P/PPP2PP1/RNB2RK1 w - -',Counter-attacking in the face of pressure is always worth considering and you have to respect Black's willingness here to take the fight to the opponent.  But really the situation on the home front was too urgent for this to be successful.  White could gain a winning advantage here simply by playing 11.Bxf7 and winning the exchange.  But...

Black makes up for it now by walking into a forced mate.  Bad though the situation has become Black was still in a position to fight on after 13...Qe7! The resulting position is complicated by White's having to worry about a possible counter-attack down the e-file which would have meant for instance that a rook sacrifice at f6 might become problematic.  White could still play the attractive-looking 14.Ne5 as after 14...Be6! 15.Rxf6! gxf6 16.Qg4ch White still has a strong attack and a material edge.  But even stronger would have been 14.Ng5! Kh8! (...Kf8; Nxh7ch)  15.Nc3! ... threatening Nd5 or Ne4 and the win is not far off.

The reason being is that this doesn't develop or help control the center.  Therefore better would've been to bring one of the N's or a central pawn into play.  By this I was implying 2.d4 2.Nf3 or 2.Nc3  She said ""Oh"" and looked shocked.  But I'm basing a little bit on what Jack has mentioned to other students about developing your pieces which I've emphasized to one of my students reachforgoals."
623,19,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I continue the conventional of the Sicilian.

He told Mariann that this is an inaccuracy as that pawn shouldn't have been advanced.  And Mr. Stockel said the same thing that I implied of which would've been better as he said that better was to develop something at once.  Therefore I said that he's as usual correct.  I said as usual not because it's obvious but rather because he's also the reason that I can coach her.  When not sure I just go by what he said.  But in this case it's definitely.  And she said that the reason behind this move was that she got the board mixed up.  Normally it'd be hard to believe but not this time.  As I noted on the second game I started off playing against Bernard and the numbers were reversed which got the colors mixed up.  When that happens inaccuracies like this are bound to happen.
625,19,5,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/5P1P/PPPP2P1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So I do things based on what Kenneth_fiore_3 mentioned in one of my annotations after coaching me.  As I try to turn it into something like the Domiano's Defense but reversing the colors.  Since the plan is to stop the e pawn from advancing to allow an eventual ...Ng8-xe5.  By that I'm alluding to ...Nf6 followed by ...Nxe4 and if white answers with fxe4?? I'd answer with ...Qh5+ etc.

I would've played 4...Nd7 but I wanted to keep my N on b8 for the same reason noted earlier.  As I didn't want to throw away the slightest possibility of playing something similar to what you'd do if black played the Domiano's Defense but in reverse.

I think that this was a very smart choice and reminds of the training game with Kenneth_fiore_3  As it turns out her LSB was more active then mine so refusing that was the right choice.

But I figured that this was a good time to exchange pawns.  Going by what Ken outlined in the most recent game with Loyd and in a similar position I feel that I'm going to gain tempo after 8...exf4 since she's forced to take with her Bishop.
635,19,15,Qc7,b'rn2k2r/ppqb1pbp/3p1np1/2p5/2B1PB2/2NP3P/PPP3P1/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',It might seem early to bring the Queen out and I usually wait.  But by my books this was an exception as she was threatening to win my d6 which is what the board was indicating.  Therefore this what the position demanded as bhidragon would put it.
636,19,16,1Nd5,b'rn2k2r/ppqb1pbp/3p1np1/2pN4/2B1PB2/3P3P/PPP3P1/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',"? Without engaging in too much conversation I told her that this wasn't the best move.  However I wasn't going to mention mistake though.  For sure I'm going exchange N for B.  Usually I wouldn't do that because of what GM Susan Polgar outlined but she mentioned an immediate advantage which I see.  For afterwards I'm going to win a pawn.  And after 11...Bxb2 she said ""Oh.""  That means she was surprised and I told her that it was easy to miss but then we continued.  This isn't so bad yet as later she's going to win back a pawn after a mistake from black."
637,19,17,1Qe2+,b'rn2k2r/ppqb1p1p/3p2p1/2pP4/2B2B2/3P3P/PbP1Q1P1/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Things start getting nasty for me as I'm in check.  And I wonder what can be done about it.  But I've found the move as I didn't think that 12...Be6 would've worked as I'm worried that it would've lost a piece but failed to calculate more as there's more then one variation that would've worked.  As it turns out I think it would've been better.  As now I'm giving her a Bishop but if she takes I would've gotten a Rook in return after 13...Bxa1.  I missed that move and wound up playing 12...Be5 which winds up in an exchange which I think ought to have waited here.
638,19,18,1Nf3,b'rn2k2r/ppqb1p1p/6p1/2pPp3/2B5/3P1N1P/P1P1Q1P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Continuing with her development and threatening my e5 pawn.
639,19,19,1f6,b'rn2k2r/ppqb3p/5pp1/2pPp3/2B5/3P1N1P/P1P1Q1P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Which I protect.

641,19,21,1Qa5+,b'rn2k2r/pp1b3p/5pp1/q1pPp3/2B5/3P1N1P/P1P1Q1P1/1R2K2R w Kkq -',Not knowing I figured that I prevented the risk with this move.  And when she gets out that's when I make the mistake.  As I'm fixated on castling right away which enables her to win back the pawn with 17.Rxb7.  Better would've been to hold off on the castling.  The problem unlike with a previous game was Ghost Vision which is how GM Tal won since I figured that there was something there which would've allowed Ba6.  That ghost vision involved the monarch because were that placed on b8 then that what I feared would've worked.  So I mixed up the King for the Knight which is unusual but especially in a training game.  Therefore I'm not proud that this happened.
642,19,22,Qc3,b'rn3rk1/pR1b3p/5pp1/2pPp3/2B5/2qP1N1P/P1P1Q1P1/3K3R w - -',But now is the time that I come up with a nasty plan which the student overlooked.

In fact this is the losing blunder as it'll go down hill from here.  It's hard to suggest the best move since there were several option like 18.Qe1 18.Re1 18.Ne1 or 18.Rh2 so the coaching happened in the end.  But I said that this was a blunder because of...
644,19,24,1Qa1+,b'rn3rk1/p2b3p/5pp1/2pPp3/2B5/1R1P1N1P/P1P1Q1P1/q2K3R w - -',"This move.  And she said ""Oh I didn't see it."""
645,19,25,Qxh1,b'rn3rk1/p2b3p/5pp1/2pPp3/2B5/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q w - -',Then she said yeah I figured you'd play that.  What she as alluding to was when I played 18...Qa1+  The problem is which you'll see in the end and I know how she was thinking as this was in my thought process back in the day.  But it was on attacking the Queen but missing the threat that came after.  After this the coaching ends for the most part for the reason outlined earlier.  So now I base it on what ION noted of not being critical when you're already winning.  It's got to happen here for the reasons outlined in the intro.
646,19,26,2d6+,b'rn3rk1/p2b3p/3P1pp1/2p1p3/2B5/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q b - -',A discovered check.  Now Mariann has previously told me that she puts her opponents in check for the thrill of it.  However this is a nuisance as it's not going to compromise black's position in any shape or form.
647,19,27,2Kh8,b'rn3r1k/p2b3p/3P1pp1/2p1p3/2B5/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q w - -',Another option was 20...Kg7.  However I remember what Jack Stockel has previously told me which was that part of King safety is bringing your monarch into the corner which I have done here.
648,19,28,2Bd5,b'rn3r1k/p2b3p/3P1pp1/2pBp3/8/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q b - -',So she goes after my Ra8 instead.
649,19,29,2Bc6,b'rn3r1k/p6p/2bP1pp1/2pBp3/8/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q w - -',So I protect whilst threatening to liquidate.
650,19,30,2Be6,b'rn3r1k/p6p/2bPBpp1/2p1p3/8/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q b - -',Not to my surprise however Mariann refuses to exchange due to being behind.
651,19,31,2Ba4,b'rn3r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2p1p3/b7/1R1P1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q w - -',So I hit her Rook.
652,19,32,2Rc3,b'rn3r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2p1p3/b7/2RP1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q b - -',Which she protects.
653,19,33,2Nc6,b'r4r1k/p6p/2nPBpp1/2p1p3/b7/2RP1N1P/P1PKQ1P1/7q w - -',? And that's when I use that time to get my remaining piece into play as I'm worried that she'll threaten to win it again.  However this is a mistake as now she's going to get a pawn back whilst hitting my N in the process.  Best was therefore 23...Rc8.
654,19,34,2Qe4,b'r4r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2R1p3/bn2Q3/3P1N1P/P1PK2P1/7q b - -',As now it appears that she's going to get a piece back.  So I think very hard about what to do.  That's because I'm feeling the same amount of pressure that I felt in my game against Kenneth_fiore_3 where he said that the position has become very complex.  And that's what happened here.  But after thinking about it I found a way out to prevent her from getting anything else back.
655,19,35,2Rab8,b'1r3r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2R1p3/bn2Q3/3P1N1P/P1PK2P1/7q w - -',As now my N is protected which means that she can't get to my B either.
656,19,36,2d4,b'1r3r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2R1p3/bn1PQ3/5N1P/P1PK2P1/7q b - -',Wanting to exchange bad pawns and try to get her advantage.  
657,19,37,2Na6,b'1r3r1k/p6p/n2PBpp1/2R1p3/b2PQ3/5N1P/P1PK2P1/7q w - -',But like with Ken and based on what he outlined in one of my annotations combined with that game I refused since I'm hitting her R in return.
658,19,38,2dxe5,b'1r3r1k/p6p/n2PBpp1/2R1P3/b3Q3/5N1P/P1PK2P1/7q b - -',?? However she overlooked it and took my pawn anyway so now I'm going to win her other R but this time without compensation.  And as noted I don't say anything with the fact that I was winning combined with what ION outlined for the reason outlined.
659,19,39,2Qh4,b'1r3r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2n1P3/b6Q/5N1P/P1PK2P1/7q b - -',Trying to set up a mate against me.  However it's not obvious until her next move.
660,19,40,2Rb1,b'5r1k/p6p/3PBpp1/2n1P3/b6Q/5N1P/P1PK2P1/1r5q w - -',Figuring that I had a mate against her I played this.  But what I miss is what follows later on so there's no mate.  And better was 28...Rb2 adding more pressure.  She can protect with by advancing the c pawn but would deal with in my books an overwhelming amount of pressure.
661,19,41,2Qh6,b'5r1k/p6p/3PBppQ/2n1P3/b7/5N1P/P1PK2P1/1r5q b - -',This is where it became obvious that she wanted to mate me.  And that's based with the loss against bhidragon combined with my game against Ted since ...Qh6 was played after white's decisive blunder.  Now I was wondering what to do here but there are a couple of options that save the position.  The bad news is that I almost overlooked it and came close to losing not only a won game but against the student which would've given her adequate compensation and thus wouldn't have learned from her mistake.  Which is why not giving the right information is a pet hate of mine.  That's because losing a won game against the someone that you're training is the equivalent to that and I'm not happy that I came at all close to overlooking the threat.  I say this because as well as 29...Qg2+ I considered a different move that would've lost at once to 30.Qxf8# and that was 29...Rb2?? for the reason outlined above since the aim was winning the pawn.  But seeing where it would've been wrong and how she wouldn't have learned I stopped that impulsiveness.  As not only didn't I allow that mate but I'm going to get another piece for free.  And this will also stop the mate as now the backrank is protect by the N once I capture.  With that being said I'm going to take her Be6 since I did not overlook 29...Nxe6 at once.  I also kept in mind that she can't take back because when I take the N will be protecting my R which is also how mate is prevented in what I call an ironic twist of events.
662,19,42,3Qe3,b'5r1k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/b7/4QN1P/P1PK2P1/1r5q b - -',Bringing her Queen back to prevent mate because of what I'm about to do.  Yes Mariann is going down another pawn but it's better then being mated at once.
663,19,43,3Qe2,b'5r1k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/b7/5N1P/P1PKQ1q1/1r6 b - -',This is the right choice because had Mariann gotten out with her K I'd have mate.  Her intent is to reduce the damage by liquidating Queens.  Normally I'd accept it because I'm ahead since liquidation would compromise her position.  But not this time.  By refusing an exchange I'm going to win yet another pawn.
664,19,44,3Qe4,b'5r1k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/b3Q3/5N1q/P1PK4/1r6 b - -',I'm not sure why she played this but I'm going to throw in another check.
665,19,45,3Ke3,b'5r1k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/b3Q3/4KN2/P1P3q1/1r6 b - -',?? But now it's mate sooner.  I was trying to throw her off guard and it worked here.  But despite not having enough compensation and thus being a resignable position anyhow 33.Qe2 would've left me speculating on how to deliver the checkmate. 
666,19,46,3Rc8,b'2r4k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/b3Q3/4KN2/P1P3q1/1r6 w - -',It starts with this move as I'm going to give her back a Bishop due to being this far ahead.  When she takes it it's a mate in two.  Had Mariann however played 34.Qd3+ it'd still be mate as my next move would be 34.Re1#.
667,19,47,Qxf3#,b'7k/p6p/3Pnpp1/4P3/Q3K3/2r2q2/P1P5/1r6 w - -',"After our second game I analyzed the first game and told her where she went wrong while we were packing up and saying goodbye.  So I said that her decisive mistake (losing blunder) was trying to harass when there was a danger ahead.  In other words I implied that 18Rb3?? was the move that lost.  So I handed her the moral and it's based on something that I've done and believe it or not made a similar mistake in a recent team game afterwards where I had a win and lost from one mistake.  Therefore I told her that it's not a good idea to harass the Queen just because you can.  As we know that's the thing that I've done before.  And she said ""Yes but it's fun to do that.""  So my response was that I know how you feel.  Sometimes it's good to do that like gain of tempo etc.  However there are cases like here where it doesn't work because there are threats that you need to be aware of.  By trying to chase my Queen you missed the threat which was the loss of a Rook.  From then on things were going to go downhill.  And she agreed with me and understood from that point where and why that happens.  What it boils to is a combination of what happened with Fred in my first loss against him one of my students (reachforgoals) in two training games with her as well as with bhidragon which was figuring out what the board is trying to tell you.  With that being said I hope and think that she will remember this lesson for future game and improve.   "
668,20,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This is the mainline of the London System from both sides.  In other words that's how it starts.  
669,20,1,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I was surprised to see the computer play this.  But I should not be.  For one thing it develops.  But more importantly it brings a threat to the b2 square as we'll see later on.  That's because Susan mentioned that it's generally a mistake to take there because there are variations then after that would trap the Queen.  I attempted a different variation but failed due to this move.  That's because those variations involve white's DSB.  By exchanging it that doesn't work out which I didn't realize.  Knowing however that the B was included I asked myself what could be done to avoid this exchange since I'd want to use it later on.  The answer is nothing as either I take or the opponents takes it so that they both come off the board.  Try anything fancy though and I'll wind up losing that B without compensation which I don't want to allow.
670,20,2,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/3pp3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',So I start developing here.
671,20,3,Qb6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q1pp3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He's coming after my pawn.  Which I am more then happy to give away but should not be.  Knowing what I was taught I figured that if he captured on that square there would be a way for me to capture the Queen.  But without my DSB it's not going to work out.
672,20,4,Na4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/3pp3/3p4/N2P4/4PN2/PqP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',That's because Susan recommended a3 right after.  But the issue was Nc3.  So I explored a different option which she also mentioned by kicking the Queen.  The thing however is that I'm not going to be able to trap it no matter how hard I try.
673,20,5,Bb5+,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/3pp3/1B1p4/N2P4/q3PN2/P1P2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Thinking that I might still have a chance to get it I place black in check.  It's similar to hope chess as I'm hoping that my opponent won't see the threat.  Which would allow Rb1-b3 trapping the Queen if my LSB is still around which is another method that she uses.
674,20,6,Bd7,b'rn2k1nr/pp1b1ppp/3pp3/1B1p4/N2P4/q3PN2/P1P2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',As anticipated but with that it's also not going to work.  I still figured that there might be a chance and play 9.Rb1 hoping that black won't exchange which does happen.  In fact that was the wrong way to think because in the process not only doesn't white get the Queen but now I'm going to lose a piece on top of the pawn.  And it'll be without compensation.  However I'm still gonna try to trap the Queen at any cost by going from passive to aggressive.
675,20,7,1Qd3,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/3pp3/1R1p4/q2P4/3QPN2/P1P2PPP/4K2R b Kkq -',As now the Rook is protected.  And as noted I'm not done attempting to trap blacks Queen yet.
676,20,8,1b6,b'rn2k1nr/p4ppp/1p1pp3/1R1p4/q2P4/3QPN2/P1P2PPP/4K2R w Kkq -',I'm not sure why black played this.
677,20,9,1a3,b'rn2k1nr/p4ppp/1p1pp3/1R1p4/q2P4/P2QPN2/2P2PPP/4K2R b Kkq -',But this is also an attempt to capture black's Queen.  My plan is here so that if Rb4 life becomes difficult because my Rook would now be protect by my a pawn.
678,20,10,1Nc6,b'r3k1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/1R1p4/q2P4/P2QPN2/2P2PPP/4K2R w Kkq -',But black answers with this to prevent that move since my R cannot land on b4 afterall.
679,20,11,1O-O,b'r3k1nr/p4ppp/1pnpp3/1R1p4/q2P4/P2QPN2/2P2PPP/5RK1 b kq -',Therefore without anything to lose I castle at once.
680,20,12,1Nf6,b'r3k2r/p4ppp/1pnppn2/1R1p4/q2P4/P2QPN2/2P2PPP/5RK1 w kq -',And black continues with his development with the same purpose.  
681,20,13,1Nd2,b'r3k2r/p4ppp/1pnppn2/1R1p4/q2P4/P2QP3/2PN1PPP/5RK1 b kq -',So I once again attempt to capture the Queen starting with this move.  And once black castles I play my next move to continue with the plan.
682,20,14,Ne4,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/1pnpp3/1R1p4/q2Pn3/P2QP3/2P2PPP/1N3RK1 w - -',Trying to stop deflect my plan.  So I attack the N to continue.  For once black retreats I attack at once figuring that the Queen will become trapped.  I know that black doesn't have a lot of options but figured that he'd defend with 17...Qa6.
683,20,15,1Rd1,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/qpnppn2/1R1p4/3P4/P1NQPP2/2P3PP/3R2K1 b - -',So I intend to do something else like capture a pawn or piece with this move.  I do have a plan that black stops with his next move. 
684,20,16,1a4,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/qpnppn2/1R1p4/P2P4/2NQPP2/2P3PP/3R2K1 b - -',Now's the time where I attempt to get a passed pawn by advancing it.  I'm thinking a few steps like exchanging and then trying to promote or something similar still trying to take advantage of the fact that black captured on b2.
685,20,17,1Qb7,b'2r2rk1/pq3ppp/1pnppn2/1R1p4/P2P4/2NQPP2/2P3PP/3R2K1 w - -',Once this was played however that's when I realized that I could not follow up on the plan in any shape or form.  Instead I won't be able to compensate for lost material.

690,20,22,2Rb1b2,b'5rk1/p4ppp/1p1ppn2/3p4/PR2P3/2r5/1RP3PP/6K1 b - -',And I'm almost ready to resign but I try one other thing figuring since my c2 cannot be touched.  But I miss something else that's coming.

809,23,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As white I would've taken on c5.  But I understand why Joe didn't play this because that would leave him with doubled pawns.  So he advances and tries to exchange on e6 which is what will happen.
810,23,6,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Stopping Joe's d5 from advancing further.  That pawn is dangerous and in some variations white is threatening to win a piece.  By playing this it's blocked therefore preventing damage.
811,23,7,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Therefore Joe develops.

And TA mentioned that it was something that he does to defeat some of those opponents.  As white though I would've played 11.Nc4 where the N appears better placed.  But I like this move a lot however.
820,23,16,1Ne5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pPn3/P3P3/2N5/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',With that being said however Terence brings his N to a better outpost.

825,23,21,1Bb5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2pn/1BpPn3/P3P3/2N5/1P3PPP/R1BQRNK1 b - -',Which enables Joe to attack the Rook and obviously Terense defends and doesn't want to exchange.  I would've since white's Bb5 appears more active but I guess that black's pieces have better mobility in this position.  I say that based on my first lesson with kenneth_fiore_3.
826,23,22,1Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2pn/1BpPn3/P3PB2/2N5/1P3PPP/R2QRNK1 b - -',I don't know why Joe this played because he's not going for an exchange.  Maybe he wants to harrass but Terence defends with his next move since the Bishop is attacked.  After that Joe redefends because instead of running back white reattacks with 16.Qd2.
827,23,23,Nef7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3nbp/3p2pn/1BpP1p2/P3PB2/2N5/1P1Q1PPP/R3RNK1 w - -',That's where it becomes obvious though that the point of 15.Bf4 was to exchange his Ne5 for white's Bf4.  However the N is as usual more active and better placed which is why like my game with Ken Terence also declines.
828,23,24,1h3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3nbp/3p2pn/1BpP1p2/P3PB2/2N4P/1P1Q1PP1/R3RNK1 b - -',Opening up the K side to give his Bf4 more mobility and thus protect it.  That makes sense as Terense is threatening to win a piece for free.  Without this move the threat was 17...g5  Now if white should then take with 18.Bxg5 obviously 18...Nxg5 and Joe cannot recapture with the Queen because of black's Queen.  So if he played 18.Bg3 or 18.Be3 his B would be trapped after 18...f4.  I remember all of this from that club game between brigadecommander and stalhandske at WTWLTR club.
829,23,25,1g5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3nbp/3p3n/1BpP1pp1/P3PB2/2N4P/1P1Q1PP1/R3RNK1 w - -',That threat is even more obvious because of this move which enables Joe to safely retreat back.

I favor black's position ever so slightly though because Terence is threatening is threatening to mess up the pawn structures around Joe's K with f3 which would leave it exposed.  Of course Joe prevents that but I believe that things are becoming a little difficult for white now especially because Joe's Nf1 is locked in.
831,23,27,Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp4bp/3p3n/2pPn1p1/P3Pp2/2N4P/1P1QBPPB/R3RNK1 w - -',With that being said Terence bring his inactive N to a better square which leaves more mobile now.

835,23,31,2Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1nbp/3p4/P1pPn1p1/4Pp2/2N2P1P/1P1QB1PB/R3RNK1 w - -',But it does not bother Terence since black completes his development.

What's interesting to me is that it's unusual for both sides to have this much material this late in the game.  Usual more things are exchanged and sometimes we're already talking about an endgame but not here. 
837,23,33,2h5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1nb1/3p4/P1pPn1pp/4Pp2/2N2P1P/1P1QB1PB/RR3NK1 w - h6',Trying to get a passed pawn of his own.

839,23,35,2Ng6,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1nb1/3p2n1/P1pP2pp/4Pp2/2N2P1P/1P1QB1PB/RR3N1K w - -',Trying to exchange N for B.

I think that resignation was premature since there appears to be plenty of fight left.  However Joe pointed out why you generally shouldn't resign especially with the Q sac.  So after that I figured out why white threw in the towel.  That's because in all variations white's position cannot be saved.  Either he is going down a piece or elyhim will get a passed pawn one way or another that can't be stopped which would enable a promotion.
846,24,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -', Sicilian defence closed variant instead of the more common Nf3.

Black has still the possibility to do the long or the short castling leaving white to decide to either attack on King's or Queen's flank. I was not sure what to do here so I opted for a I think slow move but safe.
853,24,7,Kh1,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1R1K b kq -',I've had problems in the past with the a7-diagonal so I thought it wouldn't hurt much here. But as I said I felt it is slow and also allows black for a nice attack on my castling if pawn on h file advances fast enough.
854,24,8,Bd7,b'r3k2r/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1R1K w kq -', Now clearly black seems to go for the long castling which I think it is a wise decision considering how weak is not the white defence on the White King.

Thank god Nf8 is blocking the connection between rooks. But white has also to keep an eye on f1 since black is threatening a mate there if the WQ moves away from the defence.
877,24,31,3Qf2,b'3r1n1r/1k4p1/1bbBp2p/1p1pP3/N2P4/3Q2P1/2P2q1P/R1N2B1K w - -',Now this I did not expect. It seems risky. Rxd6 was an interesting alternative.
878,24,32,3Nb3,b'3r1n1r/1k4p1/1bbBp2p/1p1pP3/N2P4/1N1Q2P1/2P2q1P/R4B1K b - -',Ensuring a knight will be placed at c5 and also defending d4 and f1 with the rook.
879,24,33,3g5,b'3r1n1r/1k6/1bbBp2p/1p1pP1p1/N2P4/1N1Q2P1/2P2q1P/R4B1K w - g6',Black will have to move slow here. Maybe h5 was stronger but the idea of g5 is to activate the rook on the 7th rank.
880,24,34,3Na5,b'2kr1n1r/8/1bbBp2p/NpNpP1p1/3P4/3Q2P1/2P2q1P/R4B1K b - -',I wasn't sure how good was this since I was happy with my position so far and I didn't want to trade my N on c5 but I had to do something active and this seems to be good enough. Threatens the BB on c6 and if retired to e8 Nab7 looks great.
881,24,35,3Rxa5,b'2kr1n1r/8/2bBp2p/RpNpP1p1/3P4/3Q2P1/2P2q1P/5B1K b - -',Removing the rook from the defence on f1 I felt but it is ok it threats Ra6 (which I did not see clearly during the game so it is not that ok then)
882,24,36,3Rh7,b'2kr1n2/7r/2bBp2p/RpNpP1p1/3P4/3Q2P1/2P2q1P/5B1K w - -',Not preventing the aforementioned 35.Ra6 with 35...Bb7 because 36.Qxb5 wins the day (and agin I did not see it)

885,24,39,3Bh3,b'2kr1n2/5r2/2bBp2p/1pNpP1p1/3P4/3Q2PB/2P2q1P/R6K b - -',With the idea to both attack on e6 (which I had seen before but Qf7 prevented anything there and now the rook blocks that defending point) and also threats to trap the Queen on the F rank if allowed with Rf1
886,24,40,3Rf3,b'2kr1n2/8/2bBp2p/1pNpP1p1/3P4/3Q1rPB/2P2q1P/R6K w - -',But I had not seen this. And when I was almost ready to retreat to d1 I found...

888,24,42,3Ra8#,b'R1kr1n2/8/3Bp2p/1bNpP1p1/3P4/5rPB/2P2q1P/7K b - -',Checkmate. It was a fun game with again plenty of mistakes from both sides but very entertaining.
889,25,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am annotating this on behalf of my good friend Jeremy (Teardrop34). 
890,25,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So it starts conventionally enough.
891,25,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',With possibilities of the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian.
892,25,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So it is a Gruenfeld...
893,25,4,Qb3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',This is The Russian Variation - a well respected variation. It was possible to go back into the exchange variation with 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 8. Rb1 O-O 9. Be2. I tend to think both are good answers to the Gruenfeld.
894,25,5,Qxc4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',This exchange is normal - black gives up the centre and hopes to then counter-attack it.
895,25,6,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ e3',All standard so far.
896,25,7,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p4np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I think it looks strange because it gives up the d5 square but in this position e5 is the most commonly played move not Be2 (which looks very natural to me). e5 often leads to the famous queen sacrifice line Be6 9. exf6	Bxc4 10. fxg7 Kxg7 11.	Bxc4	where white has given up a pawn and queen for two bishops and a knight. The verdict is out on this position - but it is considered roughly equal. This is now the Alekhine (Hungarian) variation of the Russian Gruenfeld!
897,25,8,Qd3,b'rnbq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p6/3PP3/2NQ1N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The queen retreat to b3 is far more common than to d3.

970,26,27,2Re6,b'r2q2k1/1bp2p1p/pp2r3/2bNPnB1/2P5/5N2/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I decide to push my rook to e6 to halt the progress of the pawn and I may have forgotten about my queen en prise.

978,26,35,2Ng7,b'5k2/1bp2pnp/pp2rN2/2b1P1NQ/2Pr4/8/PP3PB1/R4RK1 w - -',However I moved my knight to g7 attacking the queen.  But my opponent should not have reacted to this threat but should have continued to take the pawn at f7 and it would have been checkmate.
979,26,36,2Nxe6+,b'5k2/1bp2pnp/pp2NN2/2b1P2Q/2Pr4/8/PP3PB1/R4RK1 b - -',It seems white did not see the checkmate.  White went with g knight to e6 checking my king.

995,26,52,3Bh3,b'2bk4/2p1b2N/pp2n1Q1/4P3/2P2r2/7B/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - -',However white has decided to also attack the knight and moves his LB to h3.
996,26,53,3Nf8,b'2bk1n2/2p1b2N/pp4Q1/4P3/2P2r2/7B/PP3P2/R4RK1 w - -',I think I am just in defensive mode and not really having any chance to attack the king. I move my knight to f8 and attack the queen protected by the DB at e7 and my rook on f4.
997,26,54,3Nxf8,b'2bk1N2/2p1b3/pp4Q1/4P3/2P2r2/7B/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - -',White captures my knight with his knight.

1001,26,58,3Rad1,b'2k2r2/2p1b3/pp4Q1/4P3/2P5/8/PP3P2/3R1RK1 b - -',White moves his a rook over to d1 perhaps intending to double up the rooks.
1002,26,59,3Kb7,b'5r2/1kp1b3/pp4Q1/4P3/2P5/8/PP3P2/3R1RK1 w - -',I move my king away from the 8th rank to b7.

1005,26,62,3e6,b'5r2/1kpR4/pp2P1Q1/8/2P4b/8/PP3P2/5RK1 b - -',Now white's pawn at e5 moves to e6 and we see the plan that white is fixed on.

1007,26,64,3e7,b'8/1kpRP3/pp4Q1/8/2P2r1b/8/PP3P2/5RK1 b - -',White pushes his pawn to e7.
1008,26,65,3Rf3,b'8/1kpRP3/pp4Q1/8/2P4b/5r2/PP3P2/5RK1 w - -',I push my rook to f3 which is not the best move by any means.  I could not risk taking the pawn as one of my pieces would have been taken leaving me with even less chances.  I should have given my king an escape route.

1031,28,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So Raymond starts developing by treating this as though it were the Sicilian Defense.

1036,28,5,Bf5,b'r3kb1r/ppq1pppp/2n2n2/2pp1b2/8/PPPPPP2/6PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It's obvious.  The reason for bringing his Q out early is so that he has the option to castle long or short.  Personally after 4...Nf6 I would've advanced the e pawn or fianchettoe'd K side.  Which would be followed by bringing my Bf8 into play and then castling short.
1037,28,6,e6,b'r3kb1r/ppq2ppp/2n1pn2/2pp1b2/8/PPPPPPP1/7P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Getting a pawn chain.  After what I learned from Susan Polgar although completely different it reminds me of the London System where white plays d4 followed by Nf3 and then Bf4.

After careful consideration he gives up his B which since it appears less active then his Nf6.  Better however would be to give up his N as Raymond would get another pawn in return which would reduce the damage.  By defending the N black will get nothing else in return once white takes.

This is significant because in the course with Susan she explained that doubled pawns become a problem in a situation like this.  That is where they're doubled and you can't undouble as it later allows an attack which would be unavoidable.  After that one of those pawns is gone and you're left with problems which is happening here.

1058,28,27,2Ne3,b'5rk1/p5pp/1qprp3/2N2p1b/5P2/PP1Pn1P1/1BQ4P/RN3RK1 w - -',Not to my surprise Raymond attacks the Queen.
1059,28,28,2Qc3,b'5rk1/p5pp/1qprp3/2N2p1b/5P2/PPQPn1P1/1B5P/RN3RK1 b - -',Which Joe protects and has a threat against Raymond which is nasty.  And I studied a similar example in the course that I took which will prove to be overwhelming.
1060,28,29,2Re1,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2prp3/2N2p1b/5P2/PPQPn1P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 b - -',As now Raymond faces pressure even after protecting his Ne3.
1061,28,30,2Qe5,b'5rk1/p1q3pp/2prp3/2NnQp1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 b - -',It would appear that the pressure was over since Joe's Queen was attacked but at the very least that is with three attackers against one defender Raymond will at best lose another pawn.
1062,28,31,2Qf7,b'5rk1/p4qpp/2prp3/2NnQp1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 w - -',?? But with this move he is going to lose his Rook.  And this is where I consider it to be a lost position for black.  And with that being said I more then likely would resign here because black does not have enough compensation or counterplay.
1063,28,32,Qe7,b'5rk1/p3q1pp/2pQp3/2Nn1p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 w - -',Going for a Queen exchange which Joe is more then happy to accept since he's far ahead.  And after he liquidates white is going to win yet another pawn.
1064,28,33,Rf7,b'6k1/p3nrpp/2p1N3/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 w - -',Protecting his Rook but it does not matter because of Joe's next move.
1065,28,34,2Ng5,b'6k1/p3nrpp/2p5/5pNb/5P2/PP1P2P1/1B5P/RN2R1K1 b - -',As now with too many attackers Joe will either get a Rook for N and then a pawn or a free piece being his Ne7.  But a Rook for N and then a pawn is also the equivalent to another piece for free.  Raymond plays what he believes to be the best move.  But the reality however is that there are no good moves that we'll keep him safe.  And forget about more then likely because I would've resigned by white's 28th move as this is where I'd feel that there's nothing left to learn.
1066,28,35,Nc8,b'2n5/p4kB1/2p4p/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/7P/RN2R1K1 w - -',Preventing white from taking the N but Joe will now nab h6.
1067,28,36,Kf6,b'2n5/p7/2p2k1B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/7P/RN2R1K1 w - -',Now I'm going into something that Ken mentioned in our training game.  Not Hope Chess necessarily but something very similar and with the same idea.  Raymond is hoping that Joe will make an error which would allow a swindle of either a win but more then likely a draw (stalemate I believe) in a lost position.  But likewise once Joe has the advantage he does not give it back.
1068,28,37,3Nd2,b'2n5/p7/2p2k1B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/3N3P/R3R1K1 b - -',Bringing his last piece into play.  Be it note however that development isn't much of an issue anymore since it's the endgame.  In other words the idea isn't to develop for the same rules.  The idea behind connecting the Rooks is to organize and use both of them to deliver a checkmate against Raymond which is eventually going to happen.
1069,28,38,3Kf7,b'2n5/p4k2/2p4B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/3N3P/R3R1K1 w - -',Afraid of this Raymond pulls back.
1070,28,39,3Rac1,b'2n5/p4k2/2p4B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/3N3P/2R1R1K1 b - -',But it's too little too late.  
1071,28,40,3Ne7,b'8/p3nk2/2p4B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/3N3P/2R1R1K1 w - -',Protecting his c6.
1072,28,41,3Nc4,b'8/p3nk2/2p4B/5p1b/2N2P2/PP1P2P1/7P/2R1R1K1 b - -',But as implied above Joe has other ideas.
1073,28,42,3Ng8,b'6n1/p4k2/2p4B/5p1b/2N2P2/PP1P2P1/7P/2R1R1K1 w - -',Still hoping for counterplay Raymond tries to win back a piece.
1074,28,43,3Nd6+,b'6n1/p4k2/2pN3B/5p1b/5P2/PP1P2P1/7P/2R1R1K1 b - -',Which Joe allows but will get a pawn in return after Raymond gets out of check.  However black thinks that he'll win back material which is part of white's plan because it's well known that when you have a winning advantage it's common to give something back.  That's because when the opponent takes it makes it much easier for you.  Another good example happened in my most recent game against pagmatic68 where I coached him which was after the KID.  But I gave him back a Rook for my Bishop as then I was going to promote a pawn once and for all.  When Mike saw that he resigned.  However it really doesn't as then will come a doubled check.  After which white will get black's Nh6 leaving Raymond another pawn down.
1075,28,44,Bg6,b'4N3/p4k2/6bR/5p2/5P2/PP1P2P1/7P/4R1K1 w - -',Protecting his B for now.
1076,28,45,4g4,b'4N3/p4k2/6bR/5p2/5PP1/PP1P4/7P/4R1K1 b - -',So Joe gives Raymond a pawn.  Once Raymond takes Joe will win the last piece since black's LSB will be trapped.  And one idea as I learned in that course to win material is by trapping which will happen here.
1077,28,46,Bxf5,b'4N3/p4k2/7R/5b2/6p1/PP1P4/7P/4R1K1 w - -',Not realizing that Raymond takes thinking that he's saved his B.  But Joe is going to fork after which there's no way out.  Once white takes that piece mate is forced with no way around it.
1078,28,47,4Rh8#,b'5k1R/p5R1/8/5N2/6p1/PP1P4/7P/6K1 b - -',"I think that the overall lesson to be learned from this game is on top of not getting overly confident ""Don't give things away"" as Jack Stockel emphasizes.  Raymond started off with the initative when Joe didn't develop right away.  But he lost that advantage early by overlooking the fork between his Knight and Bishop.  After which things were going to go downhill from then on."

This is the move which decide the game also. I know very well a GM level player easily humiliate me for my f6 move but my this opponent easily overlooked and make a surprise move.

At this stage i got irritated by opponent and then take time to re plan my game. Since i smell the danger of white queen at h5 which is natural due to f6 advancement. after thinking i decided to take the bishop  
1085,29,6,d3,b'r1bqkbr1/pp1pp1pp/2n2p2/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq -',this is simple development move and also a safe place for white knight at f3. since knight at f3 want to clear the path for launching the white queen at h5. i have so many other option but i decide to go with an experiment and instead of development decide to stop the white queen.

Now Sue is more used to 1.e4 which makes this move ""the more educational approach"" as Ken puts it."

On the other hand I like her intentions which is to develop her Ng1 and castle right afterwards.

Afterall he didn't advance the e pawn but ...d6 was played as part of the KID which I noted earlier.  But in that situation it's said that you shouldn't bring the Knight to that square until the c pawn has advanced two squares.  That makes it interesting as there is theory involved since that's what the teacher did.

This would've been later on as better would've been 5.e3 but even stronger then that was 5.Nf3 which also develops.  The best move however would've been 5.d5 which attacks the N and when he retreats that's when Sue would be able to bring her Bf1-b2 and remain safe.

As white I would've played 10.Qc2 or 10.Qb3 to connect the Rooks.  But there is something going on with the Bd2.  It's not in danger but I quickly pick up on it that she wants to exchange.  I know how your feeling Sue as that's how I felt with Ken in our game but there is something to learn which also happened to me.  After what I learned this was still problematic until I spoke to GM Susan Polgar and found what there is to learn with exchanges.  And for Ken I am going to borrow that book probably when I go away again.  It might even be in as early as a month.

Now I asked GM Susan Polgar when to exchange since that impulsiveness was still there even after coaching with Ken.  In other words it didn't go away.  And not knowing when to do it I'd just more often then not go for it and exchanged which was the first inaccuracy.  One time though I didn't and held off after which I lost since the best way to go would've been to exchange.  All of this is important Sue as that's why I asked her.  And she said ""When to exchange and when not to is a complex topic and even Grandmasters at times misjudge it. 


""Generally ones judgement improves with experience. But in the meantime here are some guidelines to follow:


Trade if it leads to some kind of material or positional gain 
Trade pieces (and especially Queens) when (your King is) under attack
Trade a passive piece for an active one
Trade Knight for Bishop""  We do know though that there are times where Bishop must be exchanged for N but aside from that I completely agree with everything else.  With that being said the issue is that your Bh6 was more active then his Bg7.  So exchanging in this case helped him out.

The only negative is that it appears that Ken's monarch is potentially vulnerable.  Since two of the pawns right near it are open and we're not in the endgame.  Now I went wrong by doing something somewhat similar against Jack Stockel.  In my case I got extremely impulsive.  That was even more so then in a chess excercise which I wouldn't have been to solve.  It was figuring out how to win.  Now the simple answer was a fork.  But I was supposed to calculate variations of what it could do.  Well I gave one variation and was asked something like ""don't you think the N can get out.""  It could before I gave up not being able to figure our how it won the piece.  So I got the answer right but for the wrong reason.  Trying to apply something there I became extremely impulsive against Jack and thus acted on impulse which is a big no no as that way you don't think about the position.  I decided to kick the N similar to the previous excercise I figured that it can't get out.  I missed one move in which it did.  Once that happened white was busted because my monarch was badly exposed which from there things were going to go downhill.  In fact I got mated 8 moves later because of that.  What I learned overtime which I taught a student was not to act on impulse.  Now that position looks somewhat similar to what I'm seeing now after ...g6 followed by this move.  Of course it doesn't mean anything here but I'm making a direct comparison since in general that slows down and has inhibited the implusiveness that I've been feeling.  As I'd be afraid to play this move for the reason mentioned.  Given that it's not an endgame on top of it I would've held off but would've played something like 14...Rfe8 to centralize the other Rook."

As now he's adding another defender to his h pawn.  It's more typical when one has castled Q side but we also see it when both sides castle short just as not as often.  With that being said it works here.

The idea behind this is preventing counterplay because if you have the initiative and let the student get it back they won't learn as much.  That's why when I at one point seemed happy when I coached Gus Ken said that I shouldn't be.  I agree because what I didn't know is that I made mistakes that could've allowed counterplay.  In fact there was one that could've allowed him to win since I learned that there was a mate in 6 from this commentator.

Best would've been 26.Kg1 as everything holds since the monarch would not only protect h2.  But it would also prevent what's coming.
1213,31,34,2Nxh2+,b'7r/pp2ppk1/2pp2p1/4q3/2P1P3/1PNQ1RPr/P3R2n/5K2 w - -',And Sue resigns here because at the very least Ken is also going to win a Rook for a Knight which isn't nearly enough compensation since she's two pawns down as is.  Therefore we can both agree that there's nothing left to learn.  I think that the moral of this story is when faced with two attackers try to figure out how to stop both of them.  Also even when the idea is to develop it's still a good idea to ask yourself what's being attacked.  As the center pawn was so developing lost that important pawn.

Yes after TA showed it I tried it against reversion in our latest game as per his advice to try different opening that originate from 1.e4 e5  However never mind just KG I also wasn't used to KID until I played in my training game with Kenneth_fiore_3.  He recommended that I get use to that and then play this.  Well it didn't go smoothly but I won against this defense against my student Mike.  Was that a deserved win?  No I had made some terrible blunders starting in the opening with that unwise double fianchetto.  Then came a move in which I blundered a Rook.  It was only the failure to get the N out and other things that enabled that win.  But I felt that after a while I had enough experience to play this gambit.  However a game chat started.  Jack: I'm not crazy about this move and didn't have it in mind.  Joe: I was interested in trying the KG to get more experience it.  I felt that this is a good way to start since it's a training game.  Jack: It's allright.  Mr. Stockel wasn't crazy about this because what he had in mind was my usual Spanish Opening or perhaps Guaco Piano.  So openings that were a little more common then this.  But as you saw he went along with it.

Maybe Jack was hoping that I'd answer with 11.Rf2?? which would leave my Rook pinned.  The reason that it won't work is because I remember previous advice that he gave me which is that part of King safety is bringing the monarch to the corner.  Mind you that on that particular day I played against Jack and Tom.  In both instances my failure to play Kh1 is what sealed my fate.  The first one though was two pins which could've been broken with that move.  And in the second game which was against Tom this teacher handed down that moral which I haven't forgotten.  Jack: You moved the K?  Joe: Yes.  It's better the leaving my R pinned.  Jack: It's ok.

Believe it or not I had considered another move that coincidentally would've been better.  That was 14.Nxd5! but I was worried about 14...Qxb5?? which appears to lose a piece for pawn for white.  But there was a move that I overlooked.  If he took back I'd be able to win his with 15.Nc7+! since that would be a family fork somewhat similar to what I overlooked with Bernard a week ago when he got that fork and this teacher was horrified.  So I don't think that Jack would've taken back on b5 which would leave him a pawn down.

In this case his g5 pawn.  Right after this move the game timed out.  That doesn't actually mean that it was a timed game as we know.  Rather it's noon and I have to pack up and put things away because my shift starts 2 hours after this game.  If I had more time I would've continued  At first I would've recorded this game as unfinished or in progress.  However Jack offered me a draw when he found out that I had to go.  And I accepted the draw which makes the first time in a long while (between 2-4 years) that I was able to hold a draw against my teacher.  What's more is that it was with a defense that I wasn't used to which makes it the first time that I could get a draw against a much stronger player in that situation.
1271,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with my usual.
1272,34,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Jack usually answers with 1...e5  But he has played this before and in fact taught me the Siclian Defense.  However Mr. Stockel said that he hasn't played it in a while.  What's implied is that Jack wants to see how I do against it.
1273,34,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Therefore I stick to the mainlines.

1276,34,5,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But this however is where I start getting myself into trouble as I'm familiar with this move.  I figured he'd play 4...a6 since it's still very similar but with a slightly different move order.  Therefore although not a transposition I wouldn't be in unknown territory.  What I didn't realize however is that it was all in book until we discussed it after this game.  Figuring that this was played to exchange my more active N for his less active bishop I remember what Ken and Susan Polgar told me. 
1277,34,6,Nb3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?? As I decline and reattack his Bc5.  But according to the mentor this is the losing blunder because of what follows which is why I give it two queries.  That's because we discussed the game when it was over and he said that best was to accept the exchange by continuing my development with 5.Nc3 as now Jack implied that I went out of book.  And in doing so I'm going myself in so much trouble and won't be able to get out.
1278,34,7,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/2B1P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This was played to develop and to attempt some pressure on Jack which won't work.

As of now it's not check but this move reminds of what happens after the Domiano Defense since 4.Qh5+ is played.  I realized that he's got pressure on my K side.

In an attempt to reduce that combined with wanting to maintain my castling rights without risking safety (which is the reason for not attacking with 7.g3) I played this.  However this is a terrible mistake as I'm going to lose two pawns without compensation.  Believe it or not I think this is the losing move.  
1281,34,10,Qxe4+,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/2B1q3/1N6/PPPQ1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Jack: Why didn't you play 7.Qe2  Joe: I didn't think it was a legal move because of a pawn blocking it.  Though looking back I see that it's what I could and should've done.  By saying I didn't think it was legal I was implying that Ghost Vision was the key factor.  But the cause of Ghost Vision was the distraction and thinking too much about the tourney.  The thing is that I thought that there was still a pawn at e2 forgetting about the 1.e4 opening.  Now were it not for that distraction this wouldn't have happened.  But in doing so I'm going to lose material with no way of compensating.
1282,34,11,Be2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/4q3/1N6/PPPQBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Knowing what I had done and that I can't castle short my goal is to be able to castle long.  So I get out of check with my LSB as opposed to the monarch.  Later on he said that I should've played in the tourney because of how bad I'm playing now.  I disagree about participating in the tournament this week; I wanted training which just happened to work out.  But I agree that this is a terrible with bad performance on my part.  However our next game which will be the Finale was much better and I managed to get a draw.  I just need to learn to adapt to being put on the spot since the tourney just started on Friday combined with the fact that it only started a minute or two before this game.  And that's not to mention that I was feeling the affects here.
1283,34,12,1Nc3,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/8/1NN5/PPPQBP1q/R1B1KR2 b Qkq -',This is where I decide to continue with my development.  But the plan is to castle long.  However as he mentioned at the end of our game this would've been much better on my fifth move.

So I'll complete mine and attempt counterplay by putting pressure one his Nf6 with my next move.  However he said something that I don't buy since ION told me not to trust my opponent.  Jack: you're in trouble.  Joe: I might have a way around that.  I know that to an extent it's true but don't believe that I'm in too much since I'm prepared to play my next move anyhow.  After my next move it was implied that my mentor anticipated as he said ""that's allowed."" "
1287,34,16,Qe5,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1bn1pn2/4q1B1/8/1NNQ4/PPP1BP2/R3KR2 w Qkq -',"This however undoes the pressure and stops me from castling which is no wonder why he said that.  Thus I was shocked to see Jack play this but it's the only reason I can find for him moving here.  BTW 12...Ng4?? was almost played but with the glacoma he mistaked my pawn for the Bishop.  But by feeling it which is similar to blindfolded chess he figured out what would happen and refrained from making that blunder.  So some say it's not good and others use it.  I do use it since TA has so my model for that is ""expect the unexpected"".  Overlooking what's attacked though the game chat resumes.  Joe: What if I castled?  Jack: What about your Bg5  By that he accurately said that castling will result in the loss of yet another piece.  If that happened I'd resign right then and there.  Knowing what I overlooked and the mistake that was almost made I go in a place that I think will leave me in better shape.  "

Therefore better would've been 13.Be3  By bringing it back he's going to exchange my more active Bishop for his less active Bishop which is something that I didn't want or have in mind.  To be truthful since I made a similar mistake with dynamic_dv the only reason behind this retreat is because I studied a training game where the teacher brought his or her B directly in front of the other Bishop like this.  However I forgot something very important Ken told me which was to base it on the position.  And in this case not only didn't I base it on that but the position was almost of no concern to me.  In other words it didn't even come into consideration which is what's not supposed to be done.

1290,34,19,1Nb4,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4q3/1n6/1NNQP3/PPP1B3/R3KR2 w Qkq -',Due to my refusal to exchange he kicks my Queen which doesn't bother me at the least.  As now being put on the spot is coming to an end.  So I'm to retreat in a spot where my c2 is still protected and where a Rook remains mobile.  Therefore it'll be on d2.

And I remember this from a previous Homework some time ago that he gave me.  You use your Rook to stop the passed pawn that right in front of the opponents Rook.  This time I feel that my instincts are spot on as I do last longer.  Believe it or not while I was in rough shape and thus really struggling I'm already starting to feel more confident which will come up later in the game chat.  As now I'm feeling less and less pressure.

But there's more to the story then just pressure.  Won't say that it is since it's not.  The idea though is the same as Hope Chess as I'm just hoping that Mr. Stockel will blunder somehow and remove the guardian by taking his Queen of the square.  If he does that I'll wind up with the iniative with Nc7+ as suddenly I'd win his Rook with the N fork.

He however implied that it was a blunder.  The problem is that I only calculated 2 variations but you need multiple variations.  One or two isn't going to cut the mustard.

I just smiled after that to imply that I like it a lot.  And I said that because I didn't feel any more pressure from this point forward.  Plus I calculated 18...Bxb5 as then I was going to play 19.Bxb5 but had overlooked what came right after that.  In doing so I somehow wound up forgetting what Ken told me about calculating multiple variations since I only bothered with one or two here.

Instead of feeling confident I should've realized that I was under pressure and asked myself the same question that I asked myself which kenneth_fiore_3 asked me.  And it was how to get out of problem.  The problem was that after what took place I shockingly forgot a lot of important things that took place in that training game which didn't happen on our second game.

But if I wasn't careful on where he'd win my Queen as now I remember something from my training game with Ken.  And it's where do you move your Q?  After careful consideration I decided that this was the place to go.  For had he won it I'd resign at once.  By playing this I'm still in the fight and keep it in perspective as I did earlier which was also how I gained confident but unfortunately for me it was at a bad time.

I cannot defend it.""  I don't agree with this because there's no immediate win of material but the idea is becoming a ""Mr. tough guy"" as Jack implied with his first sentence on this move.  Sooner or later I was planning to bring it up move a rook over and then bring it back down.  As then it's the equivalent of castling.  So by checking me the way that he did I add an attacker to put more pressure on him.  It doesn't work.  I did anticipate him bringing it back but didn't realize that it was right in a spot where my Queen is reattacked.

1302,34,31,2Qe5,b'r3k2r/p2p1pp1/1p2p3/4Qn1p/8/1N4q1/PPPKB3/R6R b kq -',?? Consequently my next plan is to attack his 7th rank with Qc7.  This however is a terrible blunder that I overlooked as Jack could and should win my Queen.  When planning my on getting tough I overlooked this basic threat which isn't good because back in the day this was something that I was trained not to do.  In fact it fell right into the same category of not allowing the nasty checks or mate which is also a basic rule.  Therefore it is a basic blunder.

Seeing that his h5 is week I felt that there was no way he could defend it.  So I take at once with my next move and when he takes back I recapture with 25.Rxh5  And when I played that he said ""Nasty man.  This man is getting tough.""  However I forgot that my Queen is still hanging.  Therefore best was still 24...Qxe5 at once.  With his glacoma Jack has been known to miss moves like that. "
1304,34,33,Rxh5,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/1p2p3/4Qn1r/8/1N4q1/PPPKB3/R7 w - -',Taking my Queen is still the best move.  It's that we both overlooked it for several moves.  The reason I did was because of how poorly Jack said that I played which still gets to me even at this phase.  When I tend to forget about it is the moment that the game ends.  I've got to find a way out of that and no amount of training is going to help me since these things happen to me on the spot against Jack.  There's no control of when it happens.  I think the lesson is taking the bad with the good and thinking about when I'm playing those good moves so that things like this doesn't get the best of me.  That's been an ongoing problem for years to be exact.
1305,34,34,2Bxh5,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/1p2p3/4Qn1B/8/1N4q1/PPPK4/R7 b - -',Taking on g3 so 26.Qxg3 was still the way to go.  Then he's forced to take back with 26...Nxg3 after which I could've gotten his Rook with this move.  And all of a sudden the advantage has turned in white's favor thus pulling a swindle in a lost position by my books.  The problem I had here was repeated episodes of Tunnel Vision since I got obsessed with taking the pawn on h5 but missed the bigger picture caused by overgeneralizing what Jack told me earlier which is a known weakness for me.
1306,34,35,2Qg5+,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/1p2p3/4QnqB/8/1N6/PPPK4/R7 w - -',I said that because what I forgot is that I'm in check.  And it gets worse.  He still missed 26...Qxe5 but this is also bad as now I'm going back down a piece.  I think getting greed and overanalyzing what he said is how I wound up missing my Queen being en-prise.  And the reason for Jack forgetting to take it was the glacoma as I've seen that kind of thing before.
1307,34,36,2Qb5,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/1p2p3/1Q3n1q/8/1N1K4/PPP5/R7 b - -',But I get interested in trying to get a pawn.  So I play this with the plan being my next move.
1308,34,37,2Nd6,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/1p1np3/1Q5q/8/1N1K4/PPP5/R7 w - -',Not sure why attacked it since my plan as noted is to play 29.Qa6
1309,34,38,Qf5+,b'2r1k3/p2p1pp1/Qp1np3/5q2/8/1N1K4/PPP5/R7 w - -',But I overlooked this check.  From here I believe it's a mate in 6.  I did however present it in the Chess Problems Lover's Forum.  But they didn't believe it was mate.  I on the hand think otherwise and let comments by them be filled in.
1310,34,39,Rc2,b'4k3/p2p1pp1/Qp1np3/8/8/1N3q2/PPr5/R5K1 w - -',And I resigned right here because it's a forced mate.  Now I see it wasn't in 6 but the most I'd last is 3 more moves.  It could be blocked with 34.Nd2 but then comes 34...Rxd2  This forces 35.Qe2 but then comes 35...Qxe2 and then it's mate as 36...Qg2# would become inevitable.  However I thought it was inevitable.  But one thing is for sure which is that Jack has a forced mate so resignation was called for.  After this game we started a new one but Mr. Stockel gave his input on where he thought that I went wrong.  In it he said that my fifth move was the decisive mistake.  Therefore 5.Nb3?? was the losing blunder.  Then Jack told me the same thing he said years ago which is how I wound up giving milly64 the wrong information in her last information regarding the Larsen's Defense.  In it he said that after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nc6 is what's played but I brought the N to b3 which is where I went wrong.  Therefore Jack said that the lesson is to play moves that are played by Grandmasters.  I disagree with that.  Even after that I was ok until the seventh move being 7.Qd2 as 7.Qe2 is what would've prevented the loss of material but was overwhelmed by being put on the spot.  Later on he made a blunder in which I failed to expolit.  That was leaving his Rook en-prise and thus not liquidating Queens which would've gotten the Queen.  Therefore I think that the real moral's is learning how to adjust my attitude when it comes to being put on the spot.  For me the problem was finding out that I'd have less time then everyonelse which was only 35 minutes which enfuriated me.  Later on though I decided to get to the bottom of it once and for all before it could affect future games.  That's when I asked him why I'd be given less time then everyonelse which is of course due to being a stronger player.  Before that kind of thing affected my chess games it was problematic in life and wound up getting nasty and in one case having a temper tantrum when that happened.  So what to realize is that sometimes there are inconviences and life is about being put on the spot.  Therefore you just have to be flexible.  The other moral is not overanalyzing what someone tells you even the coach.  That's part of not trusting your opponent.  And be it note that overanalyzing anything was a problem that dates back to before I started playing chess.  It's the main part of my disability which still needs to be worked on.  In the future if I play and Jack says oh this was bad and now you're in trouble.  What I've learned is not to take it too seriously and just play normally so that it won't get to me.  Those factors will enable me to make better decisions which will lead to better results.

In this context I forgot to calculate more then one variation which is a big no no.  It looks like white is going to win a pawn but that was due to me forgetting about 4.Nxe5 after which a piece and pawn is exchanged.  However it's not a bad position yet since those doubled pawns are of no real asset to white yet.  In other words I'm not worried about them yet based on what TA outlined with doubled pawns in the beginning.

What I didn't realize is that it's a mistake as he should win a pawn and it blocks a center pawn needed to control the center.  I say that because of what will occur later on.  Best was 6.Qe2 to pin his Ne4. 
1421,36,6,Qf3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/8/2PB1Q2/P1PP1nPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',"Realizing that my Rook was en-prise and not thinking hard about what to do (because of the time crunch) on top of not being able to castle and being a pawn down I play a move that's unsound and easy to drive off.  It's actually similar to a cheapo tactic but for coaching purposes since I don't want the game timing out either.  And yes as Ken noted with one of Jeff's annotations ""Shutting down a kibitzer"" it's very easy to drive off.  But this unlike other games with the time crunch is where I use TA's strategies from his blitz Q sac (where Joe gives up his Q by the second or third move and wins) to test Perry and see if he finds the best.  In other words it's another example of where I use Joe's method to teach chess.  What he plays is what I thought he'd do but this is where I coach since his next move is going to cost him the game."

In other words he was implying that my last move was a blunder but the approach was wrong because of what follows which is why I gave him this.  So I said I figured that you'd take the Rook.  Then I play my next move which is mate."
1423,36,8,Qxf7#,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1Qpp/8/4N3/8/2PB4/P1PP2PP/R1B1K2n b Qkq -',"Then he said ""I shouldn't have asked.""  But this is where I explained where he went wrong.  I told him that I gave that Rook for a reason.  In this case my Knight and Queen worked well together to deliver the mate.  He said ""Oh I see that.""  Then I said that taking is what allowed me to do it.  Better was to protect with your Queen.  By that I meant that best was 7...Qe7 as now my N is pinned which compromises my position instead.  Even if 7...Qe7 8.Kxf2 he can still take back with 8...Qxe5.  Not only doesn't he lose anything but I remain a pawn down.  So I explained that the lesson to be learned is ""to take is a mistake"".  Therefore it's not a good idea to take something just because you can.  Instead ask yourself what danger allies ahead and if I could mate afterwards like this.  As sometimes there is a very good reason for giving something away like an immediate mate or win of material.      "

I am not sure if I should have moved to e1 as that is the file which the queen is on at e7.  The f1 square is protected by the LB so believe this move to be better.
1497,38,31,1Bh7,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppb/5n1p/3p4/6P1/1PQ1PP1P/PBP3B1/2KR1R2 w - -',Black moves his LB back to h7.  I am not sure if this is to retreat so that I forget about him which is easy to do and then they shoot out and attack when needed.  He is still pointing at c2 the square above my king on c1.

1512,38,46,2b5,b'2kr3r/1p2qp1b/p1p1n2p/1P1p4/3R1RP1/Q3P2P/PBP3B1/1K6 b - -',I push my b4 pawn up and attack the queen looking to exchange but I am protected if she takes whilst she does not have a defender.

1514,38,48,2Qxe7,b'2kr3r/1p2Qp1b/p1p4p/1P1p4/3n1RP1/4P2P/PBP3B1/1K6 b - -',I ignore the knight which is not threatening anything much other than my c2 pawn.  I capture the queen on e7.

1521,38,55,2Bxc2+,b'2k4r/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P1p4/3R2P1/7P/P1b3B1/1KB1r3 w - -',Black takes my pawn at c2 with his LB checking the king.

1523,38,57,2Rhe8,b'2k1r3/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P1p4/3R2P1/7P/P1K3B1/2B1r3 w - -',Black brings his h8 rook to e8 to join with the e1 rook and take control of the file.
1524,38,58,3Rd2,b'2k1r3/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P1p4/6P1/7P/P1KR2B1/2B1r3 b - -',My rook at d4 can only move sideways so cannot immediately act with my queen on f7 to attack black's king so I move the rook down from d4 to d2 beside the king.
1525,38,59,3d4,b'2k1r3/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P6/3p2P1/7P/P1KR2B1/2B1r3 w - -',I captured black's queen and I have the bishop pair and rook while black only has 2 rooks.  Black is short on fire power and therefore cannot bring his other rook down to join his e1 rook as this would be captured by my d2 rook.  Also he may be leaving it at e8 as my queen is at f7 and it is the only defender on the back rank.  So he pushes a pawn to d4.  He may be thinking to use this to give him protection if he were to come down the e file with his other rook.
1526,38,60,3Bf3,b'2k1r3/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P6/3p2P1/5B1P/P1KR4/2B1r3 b - -',I move my LB to f3 in case black should decide to come down with his other rook it will provide some defence.
1527,38,61,3Re8e5,b'2k5/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P2r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P1KR4/2B1r3 w - -',Black does bring his e8 rook to e5 using his pawn as protection.  The rook has only one white pawn at b5 which he could take.
1528,38,62,3Rd1,b'2k5/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1P2r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P1K5/2BRr3 b - -',I decide to attack the rook at e1 and move my d2 rook down to d1.
1529,38,63,3Rc5+,b'2k5/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1Pr5/3p2P1/5B1P/P1K5/2BRr3 w - -',Black moves his rook over to c5 and checks the king.  Leaving the pawn at b5 he may regret that.
1530,38,64,3Kd2,b'2k5/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1Pr5/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BRr3 b - -',I move my king over and out of check.
1531,38,65,3Ree5,b'2k5/1p3Q2/p1p4p/1Pr1r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BR4 w - -',Black cannot afford to lose his rook on e1 and moves it to the e5 square.
1532,38,66,3b6,b'2k5/1p3Q2/pPp4p/2r1r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BR4 b - -',I quickly move my b5 pawn up to b6 and out of black's clutches.  Black's c5 rook is unable to do much as there is a black pawn at c6 so it can only go sideways whilst black's e5 rook can move up the e file to act in defence of the king.
1533,38,67,3Kb8,b'1k6/1p3Q2/pPp4p/2r1r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BR4 w - -',The king moves over to b8 but it is obvious that black's days are numbered.
1534,38,68,3Qc7+,b'1k6/1pQ5/pPp4p/2r1r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BR4 b - -',I went with Qc7 using my pawn as defence and checked the king.  
1535,38,69,3Qc8#,b'k1Q5/1p6/pPp4p/2r1r3/3p2P1/5B1P/P2K4/2BR4 b - -',King moves to a8 and with Qc8  and pawn at b6 its checkmate.
1536,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start with my usual.
1537,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',As does she.   After which as with anyonelse it often becomes the Ruy Lopez and this is not an exception.
1538,39,2,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/1b2P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I wasn't sure what to do since it's not normal.  Yet she didn't play 3...Bc5.  But I remember yet reversion told me about 3...Bc5 which is 4.c3 followed by 5.d4 since that would late kick the B and we'd use tempo gain for the pawn chain.  Well I wasn't sure about the pawn chain but I decided that reversion's advice applied here more then anything else.  In the process of gaining tempo black will face some pressure.
1539,39,3,a6,b'r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/1b2P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"?? Which is not handled.  In fact I mentioned that this is a blunder.  And better would've been retreat as now I'll exchange on c6 after which white wins a piece for free.  However I understand why this mistake was made.  That's because the student said ""Let's play a fast one.""  Now I'd normally tell her to take the time she needed just like what Ken did with me when we were playing.  But this time I had to say yes as we didn't have that much time.  It was starting to get close to noon.  It was 15 or 20 minutes prior to and we both have to leave right at noon.  That's because she needs to get a lunch and I forget what else it was.  But I've got to ready for work since the shift started only 2 hours after it ended and figure that I need to eat lunch and get dressed up on top of that.  So it's understandable how and why it happens."
1540,39,4,cxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/2pp1ppp/p1p5/4p3/1P2P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',In fact she said that it was a terrible mistake and I had to nod.  For the same reason there really wasn't enough to analyze.  So somewhat similar to my rated game with bhidragon we had to just play.  Which means that there was very little that I could do for coaching which is why I only said OTB Game 2 as opposed to adding the coaching so OTB Coaching Game 2.
1541,39,5,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/1P2P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Developing a piece.  But now without a lot of time and thus not much time to think I'll treat as though it were a Petrov which starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 Nxe4.
1542,39,6,a5,b'r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/2p2n2/p3N3/1P2P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',She missed the better move which would've been 7...Nxe4 at once.  But it's not too late to get the pawn.
1543,39,7,Nf3,b'2bqk2r/2pp1ppp/2p2n2/r7/4P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQk -',The N was attacked which is why I protect.  But this is where she'll get it back.
1544,39,8,1Qe2,b'2bqk2r/2pp1ppp/2p5/r7/4n3/5N2/PP1PQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQk -',Taking advantage of being ahead I directly pin her Ne4.
1545,39,9,1Qe7,b'2b1k2r/2ppqppp/2p5/r7/4n3/5N2/PP1PQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQk -',Which she breaks.  To prevent the Queen from being pinned and my desire to get the K to safety I don't hesitate to castle at once.
1546,39,10,Ba6,b'4k2r/2ppqppp/b1p5/r7/4n3/5N2/PP1PQPPP/RNB2RK1 w k -',I did however overlook this move which in general isn't good.  So I ask myself what can be done about the skewer since Mariann is threatening to win material.  Not sure what to.  But  I found the next move which not only keep my pieces protected but her N will be attacked at the same time.  Now she's faced with more pressure.
1547,39,11,Nd6,b'4k2r/2ppqppp/b1pn4/r7/8/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 w k -',So she protects.  And I will not hesitate to liquidate Queens.  Not only do I exchange but this will lose castling rights for Mariann at once.
1548,39,12,1Re1+,b'7r/2ppkppp/b1pn4/r7/8/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',After which I take advantage of my opportunity to centralize the Rook.  There's to it then that.  As now I'm exploiting her weakness of not being able to castle as it appears that her King is exposed.  The issue is King safety which I can and figure that I've compromised.
1549,39,13,1Bd2,b'3k3r/2pp1ppp/b1pn4/r7/8/3P1N2/PP1B1PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',After which I attack her Rook.  Due to time management I'm not surprised that Marriann overlooked it.
1550,39,14,1Re8,b'3kr3/2pp1ppp/b1pn4/r7/8/3P1N2/PP1B1PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',?? As better would've been to retreat her Ra5.  Not only is this going to lose another R without compensation but before that I'm going to liquidate her other Rook to fully take advantage.  The reason being is that she'll be in check with 16.Rxa8+ and after she takes back that's when I'll capture her Ra5.
1551,39,15,Bxd3,b'4k3/2pp1ppp/2pn4/B7/8/3b1N2/PP3PPP/RN4K1 w - -',After which probably thinking that she's gotten a little compensation as that's how I once thought she took here.  But I'll recapture on c7. And when that happens her Nd6 will be attacked.
1552,39,16,Ne4,b'4k3/2Bp1ppp/2p5/8/4n3/3b1N2/PP3PPP/RN4K1 w - -',Which she defends.
1553,39,17,1Nbd2,b'4k3/2Bp1ppp/2p5/8/4n3/3b1N2/PP1N1PPP/R5K1 b - -',Given that she's this far behind I attempt to liquidate further.
1554,39,18,1Nc3,b'4k3/2Bp1ppp/2p5/8/8/2nb1N2/PP1N1PPP/R5K1 w - -',?? Best would've been 19...Nf6 to avoid liquidation.  She saw a lot of things but overlooked my b2 which is understandable as the time continues to fade away.  In fact we were down to about 10 minutes after this move since it's almost noon.  But I am going to get the N for free.  And when that happend...
1555,39,19,2bxc3,b'4k3/2Bp1ppp/2p5/8/8/2Pb1N2/P2N1PPP/R5K1 b - -',She resigned.  The reason why there wasn't much in the way of coaching is that we just about had to leave after this game.  To be exact there was only 8 minutes before I had to go and Marriann had to leave a little earlier.  I did do a very small amount of analysis in which I said that her first blunder occurred early with a piece.  But being short on time there wasn't much that could've been done to avoid the mistake.  My main analysis happened in our first game while we were putting the pieces and pawns (or what I call setup away.)  And I know where her blunders were.  But we can agree on one thing that Mariann made these blunders due to being short of time.  There's not much advice that I can give for that since it was a problem for me until last week.  In fact that affected me even worse then other games prior to my training game with Kenneth_fiore_3 which is how the coaching started.  I guess maybe ignore the time crunch.  That however only works for me where I don't let it get to me anymore.  If however she did that the game would've timed out.  So think of it like here when someone times out.  The difference there is that isn't lost but instead the game would've remained unfinished since there wouldn't have been enough time for either one of us to finish the game.  I like her OTB style of play and that's actually a little slower then I play.  It doesn't mean that I rush but she'll sometimes take 15 or even 20 minutes before a move.  The only issue is that we didn't have that kind of time in this particular game.  Our first game however involved me coaching her where she went wrong later on.  That game took about 75 minutes.  And I'll be annotating most likely tomorrow as that's the tentative plan when I'm off from work since there will be more time as it was a longer game unless it gets busy.  But if not it'll be later in the week so definitely before Friday.
