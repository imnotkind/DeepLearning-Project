It can also act as a superise weapon that can be jsut enough to take your opponent out of book. In this idea black must be careful to not develop as normal with Be7 and d6. Or he will get crushed on f7.

Some contest that ...b5 only serves to drive the LSB to where it really wants to go and exposes black to light square attacks from the queen side. Then there those who contest that ...b5 is a must if black does not want to be crushed in the centre. Also if propertly used b5 can be a powerful wedge into white's position. It also give black the powerful c5 square for either his knight or bishop.

Of course Be7 is not the only option for the DSB development. If he chooses he can transpose into the tricky Archangel defence system setup of Bc5 and Bb7. In that system black's bishops are very active.

In level positions the main task is to create a weakness. Black just can not play 7. ..Bxa4?  8. Rxa4 will give white tremdious power on the A- file. Also good but slower is the powerful deferred centre idea that follows from 7. c3.

Qg3 coupled with Bh6 can be very difficult for black to handle. Especially if white can get a knight to the f4 outpost. At this point it is critical that black avoids castling 0-0. Instead black must play to prevent e4-e5 or Bh6 by attacking and forcing white to defend.

The idea is that Black can build a shell nigh-impossible to crack if he keeps all his pawns close to home and doesn't do anything ""crazy"" ...like develop his pieces beyond the 2nd or 3rd ranks. As weird and unchesslike as all this sounds the Hedgehog actually is a difficult defense to overcome. White's soundest plan requires patience: it's simply to develop normally and to gradually play to gain space controlling the first 5 and then 6 ranks of the board constricting Black like a big python and working for an unstoppable breakthrough. If Black can survive this process he can generally catch White napping at some point and suddenly start playing ""real chess"" with pawn breaks and piece-led attacks of his own. Back in the 80s the Canadian GM Duncan Suttles was a virtuoso of the Hedgehog and occasionally used it to beat or draw with world-class players much better than himself."

Sure a sacrifice netting 3 pawns for a piece almost always looks like a good investment; but then you have to be able to *do* something with your extra pawns to make the speculation worth the risk.

The knights are not best on the side of the board but I plan to bring the knight to c2 after warding off your attack. My knight would have moved twice in the opening (Na3 then Nc2) also not good but you have also done the same (Nc6 then Nb4) so it is not a real loss of development. At this point we are tied in development. I have 9 development moves while you only have 7. It is your move. If you choose to castle now castling counts as 2 development moves giving you 9. This means I am temporarily ahead in development. Nathan do you know how to count development moves? If not send me a private message. I will go into more details then.
637,22,12,Qd2,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/1nPP4/NP3NP1/P2QPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',(?) I wanted to attack the b4-knight with the threat of c5(!) forcing the bishop to undefend the knight. But this move allows you to attack my queen gaining development for you. I could have played Qe1 with the same benefit without you being able to attack the queen.
638,22,13,Ne4,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/1nPPn3/NP3NP1/P2QPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',"(!) That's right punish my error!

This is an exception because in moving this knight twice you force me to move my queen twice. You advance while I retreat. "

So you did not fall for my intended trap (see note on my last move) but here you open a different can of worms for yourself. I think you would have been better to retreat your bishop to g6. If I play Nxg6 you play h7xg6 opening your h file to attack my king. Then you move your queen and castle queen side. The moves you played allowed me to win a knight for 2 pawns. I later won the pawns back leading to a whole piece lead.
642,22,17,1c5,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/1qp1p3/2Pp1b2/1n1Pn2N/NP4P1/P3PPBP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Now you have the option of playing 12...Qa5 or sacking you knight as you did. With Qa5 I would play 13.Nc2 winning the pinned knight. Playing Nxc5 loses a piece for 2 pawns. On the rare occasion this is okay if your pawns are well backed up by pieces and are hard to stop. In this case I had adequate defense to halt the pawns and as mentioned previously I won the pawns back anyway.

Often times when play the Caro-Kann my king side stays undeveloped for a little while which probably isn't a good thing.

969,29,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So my first thought is to go on with c4 but then i decided to fianchetto on my king's side be more safe.

Also seems wortheless from the time that my opponent chose f5 for his first move. g6 and then Bg7 is a classical set up for the Dutch i think.

995,29,28,1Rad1,b'r1br2k1/1p4pp/p1n1p3/8/8/2N1P1P1/PP2P1BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Now i am challenging the d file. Time for our rooks to work!

1000,29,33,1Rc7,b'1rb3k1/1pr3pp/p1n1p3/2N5/8/4P1P1/PP2P1BP/3R1RK1 w - -',Rc7 is not giving him much i think. Rxd1 would be better cause now both of his rook have no view while both mind control the two open files f and d. Also there's a ''trap'' here. He wiil lose his knight or be checkmated.
1001,29,34,1Bxc6,b'1rb3k1/1pr3pp/p1B1p3/2N5/8/4P1P1/PP2P2P/3R1RK1 b - -',The good move! Taking the knight with power no time to hesitate it. Now he's -4 behind but he can still fall in the ''trap''.

1003,29,36,1Rd8#,b'1rbR2k1/1p4pp/p1r1p3/2N5/8/4P1P1/PP2P2P/5RK1 b - -',A pure checkmate is coming after that. Great coordination of my rooks and a fine and fast game as well. Checkmate on move 19. So that was my game against the Dutch Defence hope you liked my annotation and my game too Free feel for any comments and ideas and please rate the game! Wish you all good games!
1004,30,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',So f4 an offbeat opening i have never played against it. My main goal is to built up a strong and solid defence on my king's side and then attacking on white's kingside.
1005,30,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I choose Nf6 though the main reply is d5. Also some play c5 and even f5 which seems really worthless to me (f5).

1021,30,17,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qn2np1/2p5/3P1P2/B1P1PN2/P5PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',So Nc6 instead of Nd7 which is blocking my LS Bishop.
1022,30,18,1Bxc5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qn2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/P5PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',Not the greatest choise here for white. His King is still exposed to possible threats.
1023,30,19,1Qb2,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/Pq4PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',Qb2 is good move both threatening a1 and c3 squares.
1024,30,20,1Nbd2,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/Pq1N2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',With no option here he plays Nbd2 to protect his rook.
1025,30,21,1Qxc3,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2q1PN2/P2N2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',So the pawn is back to me now threatening e3 pawn. 
1026,30,22,1Qb3,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/1Qq1PN2/P2N2PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Well here's his mistake He actually wanted Queen exchange but he forgot his exposed rook and King.
1027,30,23,1Qxa1+,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/1Q2PN2/P2N2PP/q3KB1R w K -',Rook is gone and check and he resigned. So this is my first win against this opening. White didn't control his passion for attack while i had a nice King's side defence and an energetic Queen that forced him to blunder. Feel free for any comments and please rate the game if you like. Thanks and wish all good games!
1028,31,0,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I actually meant to play d4 but my mouse was screwing up... probably because there was a mouse trap on the d4 square.
1029,31,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',No matter because now i can transpose into the blootstein attack first used by legendary grand maestro Swang Dudeetsen.
1030,31,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Staking claim in the center a very key component to successfully executing the blootstein attack.
1031,31,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',b5 was blocked from my bishop for the time being so this move was unnecessary.
1032,31,4,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',I will continue to play the blootstein.
1033,31,5,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1p1p3/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',takes away a good spot for his horsey.
1034,31,6,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1p1p3/8/4PP2/3P2P1/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Hmmm... i actually meant to play g4... there must of been another mouse trap there.
1035,31,7,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3p4/4PP2/3P2P1/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',hmmm... attacking my pawns.

1037,31,9,g4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2nppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/5PP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now i can play the move i originally intended at g4. The blootstein formation is coming together... it will be a great assault.
1038,31,10,Ng8,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/5PP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Just moving back to its starting square... i don't know.
1039,31,11,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PP1/8/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',It is quite clear that my blootstein attack has caught him off guard. If you are not well versed in the ways of swang dudeets most of his techniques look a little strange.
1040,31,12,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PPq/8/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I anticipated this a perfect time to start my attack.
1041,31,13,Qd8,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PP1/8/PPPK3P/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',Just moving back to the starting square again...

1043,31,15,Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/2K5/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',Hmm...it would appear that he has seen the potential of the blootstein attack and would like to deviate away from that. A solid choice.
1044,31,16,Qd8,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PP1/3K4/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',Retreating once more.

1046,31,18,1Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/2K5/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',He still wants none of it.
1047,31,19,c5,b'rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/q1ppP3/3P1PP1/3K4/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',not retreating this time but this allows me to develop my bishop and chase his queen.
1048,31,20,c4+,b'rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/q2pP3/2pP1PP1/3K4/PPPB3P/RN1Q1BNR w kq -',closing the center of the board. After my failed blootstein he should probably not close the board like that as now my king is safe in the center of the board.
1049,31,21,1Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/2pP1PP1/2N1K3/PPPB3P/R2Q1BNR b kq -',Developing my Knight.

1051,31,23,1a3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/2pP1PP1/P1N1K3/1PPB3P/R2Q1BNR b kq -',Probing to see if there are any mouse traps on b4.

1054,31,26,1h3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p4pp/p1n1p3/3pPp2/1PpP1PP1/P1N1K2P/2PB4/R2Q1BNR b kq -',I'm going to keep the center closed in hopes that eventually i will be able to get my king into enemy territory in order to do battle with the opposing army.
1055,31,27,1Nh6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p4pp/p1n1p2n/3pPp2/1PpP1PP1/P1N1K2P/2PB4/R2Q1BNR w kq -',Develops his other knight but he doesn't have very many prospect squares.
1056,31,28,1g5,b'r1bqkb1r/1p4pp/p1n1p2n/3pPpP1/1PpP1P2/P1N1K2P/2PB4/R2Q1BNR b kq -',Go away yo.

1058,31,30,2h4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p4pp/p1n1p3/3pPpP1/1PpP1P1P/P1N1K3/2PB4/R2Q1BNR b kq -',I will continue to take space allowing my king more room. This expansion is necessary in order to fit the many apple orchids i've acquired over the course of my chess career.
1059,31,31,2Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/1p1b2pp/p1n1p3/3pPpP1/1PpP1P1P/P1N1K3/2PB4/R2Q1BNR w kq -',develops but again not much in the way of activity.

1065,31,37,2Na7,b'r1q1kbnr/np1b2pp/4p3/1N1pPpP1/2pP1P1P/P1P1K3/3BN3/R2Q1B1R w kq -',Just exchanging horses. Not the best of moves. Much better would be Na5 targeting the b3 square.
1066,31,38,2a4,b'2q1kbnr/rp1b2pp/4p3/3pPpP1/P1pP1P1P/2P1K3/3BN3/R2Q1B1R b k -',Necessary to protect the pawn.

1068,31,40,Ne7,b'2q1kb1r/rp1bn2p/4p1p1/3pPpPP/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3BN3/R2Q1B1R w k -',Defending the pawn at g6 he can't take retake with the pawn because then i'd win his rook.

1079,31,51,3g6,b'2q2k1r/rp6/2b1pPPp/3p1p1Q/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3B4/R6R b - -',material loss is inevitable.
1080,31,52,3Bd7,b'2q2k1r/rp1b4/4pPPp/3p1p1Q/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3B4/R6R w - -',this doesn't help at all but mate is pretty unavoidable regardless.
1081,31,53,3g7+,b'2q2k1r/rp1b2P1/4pP1p/3p1p1Q/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3B4/R6R b - -',Moving on up.
1082,31,54,3Rag1,b'2q3kr/rp1b2P1/4pP1p/3p1p1Q/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3B4/6RR b - -',Now i could win the rook and after the king takes my queen can swoop in for the win. But i like this more.
1083,31,55,3Rh7,b'2q3k1/rp1b2Pr/4pP1p/3p1p1Q/P1pP1P2/2P1K3/3B4/6RR w - -',Death by pawn.

1085,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So the game started with e4.
1086,32,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',d5 for the Scandinavian Defence. I know it's a defence that comes after: Sicilian e5 Frence Caro Cann and g6 but it has become useful for me and a defence i can rely on.
1087,32,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',He took the pawn the only logical move.
1088,32,3,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play the Lasker variation and i am not used to Nf6 positions. I know the early outcoming of the Queen may cause some problems but still it's a respected reply.
1089,32,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Logical developing a piece.
1090,32,5,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And now Qa5 is the variation i am playing. Others are Qd8 Qd6 (a modern one) and Qe5+. My opinion here is that Qa5 is the best.
1091,32,6,d3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',d3!? Awkard move blocking the LS Bishop and also did not challenge the e5 and c5 squares. Best here is d4.
1092,32,7,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A logical move for black developing a piece and challenge the e4 square.
1093,32,8,Be2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Be2 is a passive move for white. I see no reason to play that. Maybe Bf4 is better or Nf3.
1094,32,9,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is an important move for that defence opening space for to Queen too.
1095,32,10,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Nf3 is ok. I think white has to decide which way he's gonna castle: 0-0 or 0-0-0. Going for 0-0-0 helps white better and causes more serious problems to black. From my experience from Gameknot and from blitz games 0-0 is better for black.
1096,32,11,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Another main-line move for black. Here always  comes the question Bf5 or Bg4. I have used both in past but i slightly prefer Bf5 at least in a non blitz game.
1097,32,12,O-O,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Logical move as 0-0-0 has to move his bishop and Queen. 
1098,32,13,e6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',e6 is an important and main-line move too protecting the bishop and the 'dangerous' d5 square.
1099,32,14,Bd2,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White can always play that move as the Queen has to be retreated. Other option is Bf5.
1100,32,15,Qc7,b'rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',So the Queen is moved to a safe place.
1101,32,16,Bg5,b'rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Now this losses a tempo. White plays the same piece two times in row. Re1 would be better. The 'problem' for white is his LS Bishop as he's blocking the Queen's view. On the other hand this is a main set up for black with e6 c6 Bf5 and Qc7.
1102,32,17,Nbd7,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Protecting the knight on f6 and open the line for a possible 0-0-0.
1103,32,18,1d4,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',d4 a good move. White should have played it at once and not d3 and then d4.
1104,32,19,1h6,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1pp1/2p1pn1p/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I was between opening my DS Bishop and h3. I played h3 to unpin the knight on f6.

1108,32,23,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppq2pp1/2p1pn1p/4Nb2/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Didn't hesitate to play that. The d file could open in a while so the rook can do his job!
1109,32,24,1Nf3,b'2kr1b1r/ppq2pp1/2p1pn1p/5b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He retreats is back. White seems like he has no plan at the moment.

1332,36,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',My opponent is a young girl of about 11 she is part of a group of juniors that gets thorough coaching and in my expierence are known for being taught to play rather attacking chess though this games shows that this doesn't come at the expense of positional knowledge blacks play this game impressed me for such a young player. The game was for an interclub teams game of which we were the bottom board this game will be very useful for learning chess players who have not come across these positional concepts before also it would be useful to have a strong player look over this game for my sake as well I'm not sure if my interpretation of the endgame is correct. 
1333,36,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I have quite often seen this flexible knight move sometimes it's played with the intention of transposing into an Indian defense system so I chose my next move to be equally as flexible.
1334,36,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I didn't want to go into a nimzo Indian here so I played another non committal move.
1335,36,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I was glad to see that this strategy of not making my intentions clear was working well black hesitated on her next move and seemed unsure of how best to proceed.
1336,36,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',Now that I have avoided getting into what she likely wanted to play we now have what appears to be a queens gambit declined this should be good for me since it is not an attacking game and is very positional one which should be slightly better for me. Whites play now should be based around an eventual minority attack on the queenside.
1337,36,5,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',However with this final transposition we now have a tarrasch defense! This makes sense from blacks perspective since this particular game gives black more attacking options than the queens gambit declined usually black accepts the classic isolated d pawn in order to get free and easy piece development and potential for better piece activity from whites point of view we need to show that the pawn is a weakness and that the free piece development is an illusion and the weakness of the pawn is of more consequence.
1338,36,6,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Of course I would have liked to develop my DSB outside the pawn chain before getting this move in however I don't think I had enough time for it any other move would allow black to push the pawn immediately is pushing the pawn a correct idea here? I wasn't sure at all weather or not it worked out and rather than enter such unclear territory I played this logical move. It is important to realize that when it comes to weak pawns it is not always the pawn itself that is weak But the weak square in front of the pawn that is often of more consequence. So it is vital that we as white strive to control the d4 square and this phase of the game will revolve around both sides attempting to seize control of the critical square. If white can immobilize the pawn then trade of the minor pieces (since the pawns pluses involve active piece play) then white will have a great position especially if the ideal set up of a queen + rook ending can be achieved.
1339,36,7,Nb5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Nbp4/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',!? Ordinarily one would want to avoid moving a piece more than once in the opening however there are some more subtle factors in play here both sides are trying there hardest to achieve control over d4 and the battle continues to rage. In any case black was threatning to push her pawn toward and thus liquidating her only weakness in which we are left in an even position where black has a slight lead in development. So perhaps this is forced if white wishes to maintain the first move advantage.
1340,36,8,Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Nbp4/6b1/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',!? This is a move I was worried about during the game but looking at it in hindsight maybe it was not as scary as I first thought. In any case the idea is quite advanced black may be intending to exchange bishop for knight in order to obtain more control over d4 however in order to do so black must first give up the bishop pair. Perhaps this move is good perhaps it is an in accuracy it is up to the players to show that their idea is more important than the opponents so both sides need to work hard in order to implement their ideas quickly.
1341,36,9,Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Nbp4/6b1/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Blacks pieces are active and on good squares it is now up to white to show that this activity will be short lived.
1342,36,10,1Nfd4,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Nbp4/3N2b1/4P3/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',After a quick calculation and safety check I decided that this move worked since if the bishop ever captures on e2 I can recapture with my knight and thus maintain control over d4 whilst also coming one step closer to accomplishing one of whites overall goals.
1343,36,11,1Bxg4,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/5n2/3p4/3b2B1/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now white has turned one advantage into another white has gained the bishop pair on an open board however In doing so black was able to exchange the LSB for the knight which in turn gives black more control over the d4 square. However for the time being black cannot make use of this and whites new advantage (the bishop pair) means white probably maintains a small but annoying edge. Actually come think of it black gains equality now by chopping the bishop on g4 where mas exchanges simply leave an even position. ...Nxg4 Qxd4 Re4 followed by d4 and maybe even an extremely slight edge for black due to better development and piece activity.
1344,36,12,1Bf3,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/1b3n2/3p4/8/4PB2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This gets my bishop away from the knights Path as well as preventing black playing ...d4 on account of b7 hanging.
1345,36,13,1Qd6,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1b1q1n2/3p4/8/4PB2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',One should always be careful when leaving a piece unprotected like this now white can be on the look out for tactics based on the unprotected state of the black queen however here I don't think there are any tactics and this is an active move by black.
1346,36,14,1b3,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1b1q1n2/3p4/8/1P2PB2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',If blacks queen were defended right now then this move would allow black to get in ...d4
1347,36,15,1Bc7,b'r3r1k1/ppb2ppp/3q1n2/3p4/8/1P2PB2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',?! I suspect this move is an inaccuracy The. I shop is no longer influencing the d4 square instead it makes this simple one move mate threat against my king. Part of the reason I don't like this move that much is because it forces white to play g3 when white probably already wants to play g3 and Bg2 anyway. Preferable was probably Rad8
1348,36,16,Ne4,b'3rr1k1/ppb2ppp/3q4/3p4/4n3/1P2PBP1/PB3P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Actually this move is quite good at first I thought this was simply playing an active/agressive knight move to an advanced point which is good enough reason in itself to play it then I realized it may even have a deeper purpose of performing the interesting knight maneuver Nf6-e4-g5-e6 where it will influence the d4 square ( again see how much play is based around this square!) however it may just be that black is simply playing active moves that pressure whites position and will follow up with a rook lift followed by brining the pieces over to the kingside which is also a fair enough plan.
1349,36,17,1Bg2,b'3rr1k1/ppb2ppp/3q4/3p4/4n3/1P2P1P1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',At this point I was looking at potential double attacks on the a pawn or even the bishop on c7 by threatning mate on g7 but first I consolidated my bishops position as well as opened up the possibility of brining my queen to the kingside via the light squares.
1350,36,18,1a6,b'3rr1k1/1pb2ppp/p2q4/3p4/4n3/1P2P1P1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Simply avoiding any potential tactics based on Qd4
1351,36,19,1Qd3,b'3rr1k1/1pb2ppp/p2q4/3p4/4n3/1P1QP1P1/PB3PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Actually I seriously considered playing Qg4 here with the idea that ...g6 weakens blacks dark squares f6 would be horrible and I felt that blacks queen would be less well placed on g6 however after a bit of a think I change my mind and decided to double on the d file whilst also allowing for possible transfer to the c3 square. Of course I had to make sure that there were no tactics here since I've just placed my queen on an undefendind square.
1352,36,20,2Rfd1,b'3rr1k1/1pb2ppp/p3q3/3p4/4n3/1P1QP1P1/PB3PBP/R2R2K1 b - -',I chose this rook because I felt the other rook may belong on the open c file.
1353,36,21,2Be5,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/p3q3/3pb3/4n3/1P1QP1P1/PB3PBP/R2R2K1 w - -',Unfortunately I missed this move altogether however the position has obtained some complications. Notice that blacks pawn is now pinned since if the pawn were to capture black could get mated. This move by black was a good idea and shows the correct way of thinking it just happens to fall over tactically. White now wins a pawn however as a result there is no longer any bishop pair.
1354,36,22,2Bf5,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p3q3/3p1B2/8/1P1QP1P1/Pb3P1P/R2R2K1 b - -',The reason this line is playable white gains a tempo attacking the queen in which white can use to move the rook to safety.
1355,36,23,Be5,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p6q/3pbB2/8/1P1QP1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',In the game I actually felt that Bf6 was a better place for the bishop.
1356,36,24,2Bg4,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p6q/3pb3/6B1/1P1QP1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 b - -',I Had been considering trying to triple on the d file however I played this because wanted to reroute my bishop to f3/g2 and I also wanted to prevent ...Qh5 where black is threatning to trap my bishop with g6. As it stands I completely missed my opponents next move.
1357,36,25,2d4,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p6q/4b3/3p2B1/1P1QP1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',Viola! After preventing this move for so long and taking careful strides to make sure this wouldn't be possible I slip up and allow black to play the move freely.
1358,36,26,2Qf5,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p6q/4bQ2/3p2B1/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 b - -',!? Wanting to avoid a drawing situation I try and complicate matters actually this is quite a risky strategy trying to avoid draws in this manner against weaker opponents. As it stands black at this point may play g6! And suddenly white has problems.
1359,36,27,2Qf6,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p4q2/4bQ2/3p2B1/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',Luckily black doesn't seem up to testing out the complications.
1360,36,28,2Qh5+,b'3rr2k/1p3pp1/p4q2/4b2Q/3p2B1/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/1R1R2K1 b - -',?! This check simply moves the king closer to the centre whites best bet is probably accept that the position is probably going to become drawish and try to make something happen out of the extra pawn. Infact this check actually loses a tempo for white which in turn loses a pawn.
1361,36,29,Re2,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p7/5B2/3b4/1P4P1/P3rP1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',Now white has given back the pawn and the position is very drawish though black has a slightly better position to be in for the first time this whole game white has the the edge gained by having the first move.
1362,36,30,Bxf2+,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p7/5B2/P7/1P4P1/4rb1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',Not falling for ...Rxf2?? Rxd4

1365,36,33,3Rd7,b'4r1k1/1p1R1p2/p5p1/8/P7/1P2b1P1/2B4P/5K2 b - -',However over the next few moves white forcibly grabs hold of the unitive and runs it into something potentially tangible.
1366,36,34,Rf8,b'5rk1/3R1p2/1p4p1/p7/P1B5/1P2b1P1/7P/5K2 w - -',Now white has achieved his goal and black is in a passive position and will have real trouble finding a way to get her king and rook back into the game however with the opposite colored bishops situation this is more than likely still a draw.
1367,36,35,Kg8,b'5rk1/1R3p2/1p4p1/p1b5/P1B2K1P/1P4P1/8/8 w - -',White wishes to take control of f6
1368,36,36,4g4,b'5rk1/1R3p2/1p4p1/p1b5/P1B2KPP/1P6/8/8 b - -',The plan is to play for h5 then try to follow up by ramming the g pawn down the black kings position.
1369,36,37,4g5,b'5r2/1R3pk1/1p4p1/p1b3P1/P1B2K1P/1P6/8/8 b - -',! White seizes control of the f6 square and I can follow up with h5. I suspect that she was anticipating h5 and was surprised by g5
1370,36,38,Bc5,b'5r2/1R3pk1/1p4p1/p1b3PP/P1B3K1/1P6/8/8 w - -',This came as a complete surprise to me I was fully expecting the capture of The h pawn as allowing white the protected passed pawn whilst also hemming in the king and rook even further looks suicidal.
1371,36,39,Kg8,b'5rk1/1R3p2/1p4pP/p1b3P1/P1B3K1/1P6/8/8 w - -',Now white needs to achieve a position where the black bishop is on B4 and white can play Rc6 with an attack on both the b pawn and the Fpawn.
1372,36,40,5Rc6,b'5rk1/5p2/1pR3pP/p5P1/P1Bb2K1/1P6/8/8 b - -',?! Too early I want to get my rook to f6 however black right now is protecting both the b pawn and the f6 square as well as that black defend the g pawn with Kh7? Instead if I had shown some patience and maybe played a bit of cat and mouse with my opponent she may have made a mistake somewhere down the line it's clear that if there exist any winning chances at all they lie with white.
1373,36,41,Kg8,b'5rk1/2R2p2/1p4pP/p5P1/P1Bb2K1/1P6/8/8 w - -',The other idea is to play for h7 and exchanging the h pawn for the f pawn but I didn't like that idea at all. 
1374,36,42,6Be6,b'5rk1/2R2p2/1p2B1pP/p5P1/P2b2K1/1P6/8/8 b - -',??? This is a very disappointing end to a wonderful game I can only blame chess blindness for not seeing the simple fxe6. Perhaps it was the ghost piece phenomena and I was still thinking of the black king as being on h7. 
1375,36,43,6h7+,b'5rk1/2R4P/1p2p1p1/p5P1/P2b2K1/1P6/8/8 b - -',The game was lost in any case but this panick reaction just makes it an even quicker loss
1376,36,44,Rf5,b'7k/4R2P/1p4p1/p3prP1/P7/1P6/5bK1/8 w - -',I found this game covered many great ideas and themes very well.and quite enjoyed playing it to. My young opponent surprised me by how well she played to. Some comments would be nice to :) I'd be interested in the endgame in particular to see if my annotations and moves were correct or if they were way off.

1431,38,3,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/4p3/2PPP3/P1N5/1P4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Also easy to spot OTB. If black doesnt play this move then white will do it getting great advantage. In response to Blitzkov-White can take the pawn on e5. The problem is that after 8...Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 Ng4 black secures equality already and perhaps is having the more comfortable game. Even if this could not be so the move e5 for black would be almost forced since white cannot be allowed to have that kind of domination.
1432,38,4,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bPp1B1/2P1P3/P1N5/1P4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I believe my opponent spent about 20/30 minutes to play this move. It is a ridiculous amount of time.

However *since black did not do anything wrong his position cannot be worse!*. That is all I needed to know to play my next move-after white plays b4 then I will think about what to do. Don't get this mixed up with the beginner player who moves without checking the opponent's response and then when the opponent makes a winning move then he thinks for 10 minutes. I know that I have played moves that were all principled in an opening that is not tactical and with strategic foundation.

Now black actually secures a nice edge. *Since Black has more activity any and all complications(like the continuation of the game) will favor him and he will have more tactics.* My opponent had to think for very long amounts of time on his moves since he did not know this idea.
