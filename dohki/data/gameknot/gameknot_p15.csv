Normally losing games can be quite depressing but sometimes, if you find yourself making threats of your own against your opponent, before you succumb, particularly if he/she is nearly 700 points north of your rating, it can sometimes be quite uplifting.  Here is the first of two such games against my IM opponent David Patron where Glenda does her best to take down King David but alas is beaten back and this time Henry cannot evade Old Matey's scythe. So how does this happen?  Well, you can look at gameknot analysis, read on or both.

The problem is that I did not give that anymore thought until an annotation.  And, nuntar mentioned that in many cases there's a better way to break the pin then just using the B because it is more aggressive.  What Mike was alluding to is attacking with the pawn as TA did.  And, that is also why played 5.Nge2, as opposed to, 5.Nf3.  The idea being is that, instead of the N, had Bd2 been played, albertwall would not have had a problem because Joe's Nc3 is more powerful, in this position.  With that being said, if black were to exchange now, white would just bring the other N to the more powerful.  Not surprisingly, black will have none of that, so he is now forced to lose tempo.

There is no immediate mate, but I believe that there is nothing that black to do to stop TA from getting a passed pawn.  That would be enough of a reason for me to resign.  That's because, in this case, a passed pawn would almost guarantee Joe a promotion.  And, I think that the only way for black to stop that would be to deal with the loss of an additional piece without compensation, like one of this N's.  With that, I'm pretty sure that albertwall felt like he had nothing left.  In the aftermath of this Joe told me something that kenneth_fiore_3 during our first training game.  During that lesson, I was learning to control myself when it came to exchanges and look at multiple.  As Ken refused to exchange because of the amount of pressure he had which is, eventually the way I started thinking after remaining impulsive.  In it, Ken said, ""This type of position is white trading pieces down is the wrong idea sometimes. If you've got pressure on an opponent, trading eases things for the opponent.""  And, that amount of pressure is how he won, after a blunder from me.  He also said, ""What's important from this game is that you are learning to think about your future moves in regards to multiple threats""...  For me, that's instructive and educational because the similarity is the amount of pressure that Joe had against albertwall.  With that being said, the moral of this story is what Joe said which reads, ""Albert I defeated several times,but under different handle names.His 
weakness is multiple attacks with added pressure in the mid to endgame.""
