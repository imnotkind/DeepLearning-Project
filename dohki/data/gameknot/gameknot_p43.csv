0,0,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',"With Jack Stockel I'd expect it.  But the thing with Bert is that I didn't know what he would play as this was the first time I played against him.  And after 1.e4 since the Siclian Defense is commonly played but this is as well.  So I wasn't sure how he's respond as there's lots of choices but I was prepared for anything he'd do with the saying ""Expect the unexpected.""  This is why it's my model.  Afterall GM elyhim the Carro Kann which I was unprepared for and therefore led to Hope Chess Flip Coin Chess and eventually unsound agression and at one point cheapo tactics which led to my downfall as I played way to fast and went for threats that were too obvious to drive off.  Since I improved I promised myself not be taken off guard which is why ""Expect the Unexpected"" is my model.  And for those wondering I am all but certain that joveyboy1 learned that term from me because after I used it he then used it in one or two of his annotations."
1,0,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I'd figured he played this but like before I really wasn't certain how he's respond as the Petroff Defense is also common.  But once he played this I was automatically going to play Ruy Lopez.  Now here's the thing I was once told that it's generally not a good idea to play the Ruy Lopez against much stronger players.  However I disagree with him.  The idea being is that I have defeated Jack Stockel on one or two occassions with the Ruy Lopez.  And when I do lose which is supposed to happen I still play extremely well.  In other words it's a good loss because I generally don't go wrong into the end.  And this was no exception because of how well I wind up playing.
2,0,2,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"I usually don't see this but likewise I'm not surprised as Jack has on or two occassions played this against me.  So I know what to do.  As usual I exchange but for a different reason.  Going by what C++ said it isn't exchange early and often as what used to.  But here that N is powerful and I consider to be a bit overwhelming because of how dangerous they're known to be.  To prevent the Fight or Flight Syndrome which isn't supposed to happen or getting overwhelmed I decide that the best thing to do is exchange.  That way I'm taking care of something before it can become a problem.  It is worth noting that confidence is very important to prevent you from getting anxious because as Jack says which I emphasize to my students ""Don't get nervous.""  Plus I'm already planning something with the in between which is strategy as I learned from GM Susan Polgar.  The strategy being the exchange to enable castling right after."
3,0,3,c6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Not at all surprised.  I knew at some point he'd played this.  In fact I thought that Bert would do this right here after the exchange.  And when you think about it this makes sense.  Now you get into minds of how stronger players feel.  Now I know as black anticipated that I'd force the exchange with the idea being to castle and afterwards he gain tempo by playing this.
4,0,4,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/1p6/B2pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',Now I really had to evaluate if 7.Bb3 was safe.  As some will recall in an annotation by someone who I also mentored he annotated a move and I said the B should've move back as would be here.  And they accurately pointed out that I was wrong as he'd lose the B when the opponent boxes it in with one of my pawns.  Then in one of my more recent games I made that same mistake.  So I really had to evaluate and as usual which is why it's important do my HW to figure out if 7.Bb3 and if not how he'd win a piece.  After careful considerations I determined that retreating to b3 is in fact the right move.
5,0,5,Ba6,b'r2qkbnr/p2p1ppp/b1p5/1p6/3pP3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Standard development.
6,0,6,d3,b'r2qkbnr/p2p1ppp/b1p5/1p6/3pP3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Bert was threatening 8...b4 which would be a nasty discovered attack on my R in which case I can defend but would have to waist tempo when time is needed.  Also the Q side is jammed this time around since 8.Nc3?? is not an option because of 8...dxc3 losing a piece for pawn too early in the game.  So the idea as I learned was planning and strategy so that I can develop whilst preventing him doing damage for the reason outlined.  And while it might not seem so the loss of tempo is very damaging more so then it might seem.
7,0,7,Bd6,b'r2qk1nr/p2p1ppp/b1pb4/1p6/3pP3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',The idea is to develop.
8,0,8,Nd2,b'r2qk1nr/p2p1ppp/b1pb4/1p6/3pP3/1B1P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',But now I develop and I do it based on what I learned from Susan Polgar and also combined with what cplusplus11 recently told me.  For a while as I've seen in GM games including the one with Susan which I annotated last week; instead of bringing the N completely out you develop them closer to the home square.  I mean regularly so that it's passed the second rank for white and seventh for black sometimes there are exceptions to that.  And one would wonder why.  First as noted Nc3?? for the same reason as before wasn't an option.  Second this is another thing to note about planning and strategy.  When a N is placed like this it seems a little uncomfortable but the reality of it is that you're planning a better outpost for it.  In this case the short term plan is to get to f3.  The long term plan which is part of the short term is that after I can deploy it to that square I'll be able to develop my last piece with very little to no loss of tempo.  In addition as we'll see later bringing my N to f3 is going to win a pawn sooner or later which is also part of my plan.  And this time I did without miscalculation because of what I learned from that grandmaster.  This is very important because in the past even with the person that I don't name or like but still would apply what he said for improvement some of the time I'd still have problems thinking ahead without miscalculations.  In fact that recently happened up until I believe it was late May where in early May this happened and I lost a piece early.  But with lessons from Susan that's no longer happening as things become second nature very quickly so I learn much sooner.  Without that lesson it's likely that I'd be panicking and possibly making mistakes.
9,0,9,Qc7,b'r3k1nr/p1qp1ppp/b1pb4/1p6/3pP3/1B1P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I would've played 9...Nf6 to prepare for 10...0-0  But as we'll see later Bert is going to castle on opposite wings.
10,0,10,1Nf3,b'r3k1nr/p1qp1ppp/b1pb4/1p6/3pP3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The very first part of my plan that I mentioned earlier.
11,0,11,1Bf4,b'r3k1nr/p1qp1ppp/b1p5/1p6/3pPb2/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',You also have to aware of things that might get in the way as I learned from the same person.  There are things that do get in between these as is the case here.  And with it I felt that best was to exchange.  First given that I haven't gotten my DSB whereas his is on a powerful I felt that his B was stronger then mine.  So it'd be to my benefit to exchange.  Second I'm thinking like a GM at this point.  Susan Polgar said that you don't need any complex method to think like a grandmaster.  Instead the key to doing so is finding forced moves which is what I do here.  Most importantly as noted part of the plan behind finding a good outpost for my N was winning a pawn which now happens after the exchange.  The idea of course is that when ahead it's to your benefit to liquidate pieces.  And as it turns out this exchange is in reality liquidation since I will a center pawn which is one of the more important pawn immediately after.
12,0,12,g6,b'r3k1nr/p2p1p1p/b1p3p1/1p6/3NPq2/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I don't know what this accomplishes but I would've played 12...Nf6 here.  I know about getting the basics out of my head which now I do in extenuating circumstances.  But I don't see a circumstance that would prevent him from doing that in this position.
13,0,13,1Qf3,b'r3k1nr/p2p1p1p/b1p3p1/1p6/3NPq2/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Also optional was to force black to lose tempo by hitting the Q with 13.Ne2  But the only reason I would've played that was for the thrill of attacking something which as we know is not the reason something ought to be attacked.  Therefore I think I found a much better move which is why I played this.  The idea being is to liquidate Q's since I'm a pawn up and that's what will happen so I'm glad I moved here.
14,0,14,Nh6,b'r3k2r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p6/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',"! Best in my opinion.  Personally I would've played 14...Nf6 but I like this better.  What's going on here?  Well although not the reason for taking as would be very unsound I am coincidentally threatening 15.Ng5 followed by a capture on f7 so as they say the f7 square.  This time with his black's decision to play 6.Ba4 Bert's B is as Jack calls it ""out of play"" for the moment so it cannot defend the square.  But with this move however that changes.  It's because of an overload in which black adds a defender to that square."
15,0,15,1Rae1,b'r3k2r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p6/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b kq -',As we know another way to control the center is by attacking it as well.  In general it's done with the R by moving to the home rank (the rank where they start) and on the center file.  So this is a perfect example.  Best was however 16.Ng5 because of what's about to happen.
16,0,16,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p6/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Not surprised that he played this but I am shocked however that he castled on opposite wings.  I have seen it before but not in a position like this.  With that being said I would've castled short.  But I think the reason he castled this way is still the pressure that I cause with 16.Ng5 and  15...0-0 would've increased the pressure.
17,0,17,1Ng5,b'2kr3r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p4N1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',So I do something before he can come up with other ideas to prevent me from putting that pressure.  Worth noting that I'm not taking chances since he's a stronger player.  And with that I'm trying to play moves that I'd typically see from GM's.  If he were about my rating lower or just very slightly higher it'd be a different story.  But with a Class A Player however I do my best to not take chances of counterplay.
18,0,18,1Rdf8,b'2k2r1r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p4N1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',To my surprise however he is able to prevent that pressure.  This is why Ng5 in my opinion ought to have been played a move earlier.
19,0,19,1Re3,b'2k2r1r/p2p1p1p/b1p3pn/1p4N1/4P3/1B1PR3/PPP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',Therefore before I miss any opportunities unless he comes up with something the plan is to double up so that the R's are on one file.
20,0,20,1f6,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b1p2ppn/1p4N1/4P3/1B1PR3/PPP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',But when he plays this however I think about what to do.  I could retreat with 18.Nf3
21,0,21,1Rh3,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b1p2ppn/1p4N1/4P3/1B1P3R/PPP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',"After some careful considerations however I decided to play this.  First should and when he takes on g5 I take back which continues the liquidation of pieces as I'm still a pawn up.  Second but more importantly I have studied a lot of GM annotations.  In total it was 9 GM annotations and I also combined it with annotations from expert charleshiggie.  Of these annotations all but one did this.  Which is that when the opponent attacks a piece instead of retreating you reattack the same piece which I do here.  And as noted I'm trying to play like a GM for the reason noted before.  In addition the other places would lose the N so the only safe retreat would be 18...Nf3  But doing so means boxing in my R which I don't want because it means losing the mobility.  And as I learned from thereaper1 and Jack (when I lost with a blunder that took away the R's mobility) ""Mobility is the most important chess aspect.""  And I absolutely agree with this to large extent.  Maybe not the absolute most important as there are things like tempii and losing material but mobility however is one of the most important things."
22,0,22,c5,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/1pp3p1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',I think he's coming up with a way to promote.
23,0,23,2a4,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/1pp3p1/P3P3/1B1P4/1PP2PPP/5RK1 b - a3',? Up until this point I don't think I made a single mistake.   But I'm determined to stop a situation like this.  While I looked at this no good was 20.d4?? because of 20...c4 in which case I'd lose a piece since that B is blocked in.  But I overlooked something.  So best was 20.c4 and if 20...bxc4 I can answer with 21.cxd4 in which I'm still a pawn since 21...Bxc4?? isn't an option do to my LSB as I'd play 22.Bxc4  But what I anticipated was 20.c4 b4 because it acheives a solid pawn chain.  And if he played that I wouldn't know what to do.  But with this move however I thought I knew everything and was getting pleasure in the position.  However I went overboard because of what's about happen.  Had I played the right move black wouldn't have compensated at least for now.  
24,0,24,2c4,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/1p4p1/P1p1P3/1B1P4/1PP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',Although I thought he'd take this was the other move that I thought he played so I planned this as well.  But unlike before this time I miscalculated because what I didn't know is that I gave him back a pawn which is something I didn't want to happen.
25,0,25,2dxc4,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/1p4p1/P1P1P3/1B6/1PP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',However not realizing that I already made a mistake I played this with the idea of eliminating his pawns.
26,0,26,2Ba2,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/6p1/P1p1P3/8/BPP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',Believe it or not while mentioning variations I calculated this.  But that was by playing through variations in those GM annotations and applying them here.  And that is one reason that playing through variations is good and where it'll help one improve his or her games especially against a much stronger player like Bert.
27,0,27,2c3,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/6p1/P3P3/2p5/BPP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',! As I noted earlier before I didn't realize the mistake I made before but this is how 20.a4? won that pawn. 
28,0,28,2bxc3,b'2k2r1r/p2p3p/b5pR/6p1/P3P3/2P5/B1P2PPP/5RK1 b - -',"?? Not knowing it at the time and thinking that I was still a pawn up I captured here.  Now it would seem that material wise things are still even after 23...Bxf1 24.Kxf1  But as we know just because things are level doesn't mean the position is equal.  With that being said this loses.  The idea being is that while not right away after we exchange black will eventually wind up with a passed pawn with no way to stop it.  In part because Bert will be able to protect those pawns and stop any of my passers with his R.  And the reason why that other R dosen't count is because it is as of now out of play.  So it proves to be useless for something like this.  After the game Bert told me that there was no to avoid losing the R.  But after being my spectator well although I hate having to disagree with anyone with anyone I must regretfully say that he is wrong.  For if I did not make this blunder I wouldn't have lost the R.  So I'm going by what C++ outlines in his profile which I mentioned in the game with Mariann which is ""It only takes one bad move to lose a game. So be careful on every move.""  I know this offhand because in a game that Tom annotated he was up against a master.  And he was winning with a won position after the master blundered a piece early.  Now Tom only made one mistake but it was enough to turn that win into a loss.  That's when he told me that it only takes one mistake to lose and someone else also told me that when his opponent only made one mistake and lost.  "
29,0,29,Rf4,b'2k4r/p2p3p/6pR/6p1/P3Pr2/2P5/B1P2PPP/5K2 w - -',Not surprised that he's going after my center pawn.
30,0,30,2f3,b'2k4r/p2p3p/6pR/6p1/P3Pr2/2P2P2/B1P3PP/5K2 b - -',Thinking about what to do I also considered 25.Be5 but the reason I played this is to try and get a solid pawn chain.  But unlike my game with Mariann it doesn't apply here because as noted I won't be able to do anything with my pawns.  But I still like this better in case black does what you'd see with GM's.  This time the plan to centralize his K with 25...Kc7 and then followed by ...Kd6  And after taking those tests which you know about I kept in mind that black might attempt that.
31,0,31,2Rh4,b'2k4r/p2p3p/6pR/6p1/P3P2r/2P2P2/B1P3PP/5K2 w - -',This is why my remaining R as noted earlier is out of play.  Now I think about what to do and actually do a lot of HW here.  I see that h2 is attacked don't want to exchange R's at this point.  Although it appears even as mentioned it isn't because black has a winning advantage.  And I felt that if I exchanged which will happen later on he'll be able to use his R to stop my pawn.  But after further consideration I determined that white must exchange like it or not.  If I don't take forget about the loss of a pawn.  Instead Bert will win my remaining R with no way around it or compensation.  So 26.Rxh4 is indirectly forced in this position. 
32,0,32,2g3,b'2k4r/p2p3p/6p1/8/P3P2p/2P2PP1/B1P4P/5K2 b - -',Thinking about what to do I advance a pawn.  I also kept in mind that Bert must be careful and not underestimate as otherwise I might be able to promote.  While it appears so this isn't Hope Chess because it's not what I'm hoping for.  I'm sure he won't but what it boils down to is that I'm doing anything for counterplay seeing that the position is more or less lost.  The idea is not getting nervous and seeing if you can do anything to get out trouble.  Unfortunately it isn't but thinking the way I do helps me last longer however.
33,0,33,2Rf8,b'2k2r2/p2p3p/6p1/8/P3P2p/2P2PP1/B1P4P/5K2 w - -',I thought he'd take on g3 and then even when I took back the position is still better for black.  However I'm not surprised that Bert played this either.  And it is better then capturing.  That's because he threatens to win a pawn.
34,0,34,2f4,b'2k2r2/p2p3p/6p1/8/P3PP1p/2P3P1/B1P4P/5K2 b - -',Of course I won't allow it.
35,0,35,2hxg3,b'2k2r2/p2p3p/6p1/8/P3PP2/2P3p1/B1P4P/5K2 w - -',Normally I would've exchanged but 28...RXP+ would've been a nasty check for me which I was going to prevent.
36,0,36,Kc7,b'5r2/p1kp3p/6p1/8/P3PP2/2P3P1/B1P5/5K2 w - -',And now he starts centralizing his K.  Of course it's not centralized yet because in order for you to be able to do that my K would have to be forced on one square which would allow mate.  But that's his plan.
37,0,37,3Bd5,b'5r2/p1kp3p/6p1/3B4/P3PP2/2P3P1/2P5/5K2 b - -',A small reason for this move was to add an overload to my e pawn and keep a good chain.  One thing I learned is that your B near a pawn like this can keep a pawn chain.  The main reason was to try and stop his plan from actually being able to centralize my K.  You will note that after the double bishop mate quiz I was on the other end and the quiz to see how long you'd be prolong to the mate.  One thing you had to do was get the K in the middle so that he couldn't keep on checking you until there was mate.  Here it's not the same as I don't advance the K but rather move the B forward.  But the same thing could be said as it's for the same reason.  So while can and will advance forward it will be impossible to confine my K to one square as of now.  With that being said I already start to build a little confidence.  But it's not confidence of counterplay but just that I can last a little longer.  And this time my instincts are wrong since there's still a way to go before I resign.
38,0,38,3Kd6,b'5r2/p2p3p/3k2p1/3B4/P3PP2/2P3P1/2P5/5K2 w - -',With what I mentioned before this is the move that I anticipated and took right into calculation without miscalculating as I'm pretty sure he'd keep advancing closer to my K and towards the center which is completing centralization had I not played 30.Bd5
39,0,39,3c4,b'5r2/p2p3p/3k2p1/3B4/P1P1PP2/6P1/2P5/5K2 b - -',So now I'm adding my own overload to the B since he might try to foil my plans with the R.  It wouldn't happen now but this might be his long term plans so I stop it in case my instincts are right and that's what Bert has in mind.
40,0,40,3Kc5,b'5r2/p2p3p/6p1/2kB4/P1P1PP2/6P1/2P5/5K2 w - -',Black has other ideas so this is something that I overlooked in part of my plans.  So I really start thinking about what to do next.  As noted because I'm up against a much stronger player I'm trying to play especially with this position like a GM.
41,0,41,3e5,b'5r2/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP3/P1P2P2/6P1/2P5/5K2 b - -',So it starts here also bearing me in mind that black must be careful not to underestimate me.  For if he does that pawn will continue advance because if he doesn't find the right move that will become a passer and I'll be able to promote.  Since I felt that the position was lost as is with nothing else to lose this is where I start doing Hope Chess doing anything for counterplay.  This is aside from resigning which we all agree would be premature or getting so nervous that I start making mistakes.  By playing this however I gain confidence.  But it won't last long.
42,0,42,3Kd4,b'5r2/p2p3p/6p1/3BP3/P1Pk1P2/6P1/2P5/5K2 w - -',So my instincts were right.  His goal is to force my K to one square.
43,0,43,3Ke2,b'5r2/p2p3p/6p1/3BP3/P1Pk1P2/6P1/2P1K3/8 b - -',"Knowing that and remembering what happened on the other end seeing how long I'd be able last against being mated by both bishops and making mistakes this time I stop his long term plans as now Bert can't advance his K further unless he plays 34.Kc3  But even so my K won't be confined to only one square.  With that being said I also retained in addition to that quiz what shamash said.  ""It's not about how much you learn but rather applying what you learn and using it towards your game.""  Without that advice I would've forgotten about that quiz as well and as a result missed something like this. "
44,0,44,3Rb8,b'1r6/p2p3p/6p1/3BP3/P1Pk1P2/6P1/2P1K3/8 w - -',While I last longer as a result the move played does not bail me out of trouble.  In fact nothing will as Bert has a win in this position.  But it will take longer.
45,0,45,3Kd2,b'1r6/p2p3p/6p1/3BP3/P1Pk1P2/6P1/2PK4/8 b - -',Keeping this in mind I play this before black can get the opposition and increase his advantages even further.
46,0,46,3Rb2,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/3BP3/P1Pk1P2/6P1/1rPK4/8 w - -',He wants my a pawn.  Now I'm going to see what I can do.
47,0,47,3a5,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/P2BP3/2Pk1P2/6P1/1rPK4/8 b - -',I try to stall his plan with this move.  But I quickly see that it's of no use because there's no way I can stop him from taking there.
48,0,48,3g4,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/P2BP3/2Pk1PP1/8/r1PK4/8 b - -',"Believe it or not I originally played 36.c3+  But I forgot something very important being that this is an illegal move.  I did something similar when taking a quiz as black to see how long you could last and during that quiz I mentioned a similar move and he said something that you'd typically hear of a teacher saying ""Do you think that's a legal move?""  When I looked at it I realized that it wasn't.  Well the same thing applies here so when I checked Bert accurately said something that someone told me when I was learning the game like where the pieces could move etc by saying ""You can't do that.""  This was the only game chat and likewise he's right because I overlooked that the c pawn is pinned.  Having said that I play this because the plan which I forgot was illegal still remains.  With that being said I also want to see what he's going to do because if black is not careful I can get counterplay.  In this case a swindle with one of my pawn.  And although they're not passed pawns I beared in mind from previous that it doesn't take a passer for a pawn to be dangerous."
49,0,49,3Rxa5,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/r2BP3/2Pk1PP1/8/2PK4/8 w - -',This is where I felt that black became overly confident.  Later on however I discovered that I was wrong.  But here my optimisim increased as I felt that I can pull a swindle.  Of course as we headed later on I realized that it isn't true.  In a case like this however I'm glad to be wrong because gaining that confidence which is what I try for my students does prevent me from resigning which I still wouldn't here or make worse mistakes.  And making the position would've however occurred if I didn't gain any confidence.
50,0,50,3c3+,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/r2BP3/2Pk1PP1/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',So I finally play it.  And using memory techniques from my games against Jack I kept in mind that a check like this could be quite nasty.  Now I have one occasion pulled a swindle against my coach by doing this.  But as we'll see and not surprisingly the plan will not work. 
51,0,51,3Kc5,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/r1kBP3/2P2PP1/2P5/3K4/8 w - -',But as noted there's not chance of counterplay which is how it's supposed to be since you learn more from games that you lose.  In addition with this move this position is just like how it was before the check.
52,0,52,3Kd3,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/r1kBP3/2P2PP1/2PK4/8/8 b - -',?! To try and prevent any more damage I play this.  But it's an inaccuracy because it loses tempo with the next move.  This time tempo is very much needed due to the situation that I'm in.
53,0,53,3Kd2,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP3/2P2PP1/2P5/3K4/r7 b - -',To prevent him from checking me on d1 I respond here with the same idea.  However he could've played 39.Ra2+ and I was prepared.  For if he played that I would just move back to d1 with the idea that he'd keep checking me and I'd make the same move back and forth until the game ends in a draw by repetition.
54,0,54,3Rg1,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP3/2P2PP1/2P5/3K4/6r1 w - -',First Bert will not allow that since he is a much stronger player.  But he also has other ideas.  Black wants my g pawn.
55,0,55,4g5,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P2/2P5/3K4/6r1 b - -',So I have to protect.
56,0,56,4Rg3,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P2/2P3r1/3K4/8 w - -',I don't know why he played this.  As black I would've played 40...Rg4 which would've won another pawn.
57,0,57,4Kc2,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P2/2P3r1/2K5/8 b - -',So I go here with the idea being to try and get him to lose more tempo since things won't be as easy.  Not a good thought process as the idea since I'm lost is more Hope Chess since I felt that I had nothing else to lose.  The idea is that in that situation you might as well as Jack once implied when I was going to mate him no matter what he did.  So he took and said that he might as well have taken since I'd mate one or another.  The reason is that he had no good moves left one way or another which is exactly how I felt here.
58,0,58,4Rh3,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P2/2P4r/2K5/8 w - -',Like before I have no idea what this move accomplishes.
59,0,59,4Kb3,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P2/1KP4r/8/8 b - -',But the reason I moved is for the same reason that I played 41.Kc2
60,0,60,4Rh4,b'8/p2p3p/6p1/2kBP1P1/2P2P1r/1KP5/8/8 w - -',And now he's going to win my f pawn no matter what I do.
61,0,61,4e6,b'8/p2p3p/4P1p1/2kB2P1/2P2P1r/1KP5/8/8 b - -',But this is where I felt that he became overly confident.  I initially felt that I'd be able to promote if black doesn't find the right move which I'm sure he will.  But by playing his last move I anticipated he'd take which Bert does but then I take back and suddenly I felt that I was slightly better despite winning a pawn after 44...Rxf4.  It isn't because not only does he win a pawn but there's another move that I overlooked.
62,0,62,4Bd5,b'8/p6p/6p1/2kB2P1/2P2r2/1KP5/8/8 b - -',This is why I thought I was a little better then earlier.  The reason being are those doubled pawns which are now passed pawns.  And it's where I kept in mind that doubled pawns can be beneficial if one could promote and I also kept in mind that I had my LSB at this point defending both of them.  But I overlooked the fact that his K effectively blocks both of my passers which is another reason that there's no hope left for white at this point.
63,0,63,4Bg8,b'6B1/p6p/6p1/2k3P1/2P3r1/1KP5/8/8 b - -',Without any miscalculation as I remembered what Susan said.  The idea being that the key to thinking like a GM is finding forced moves.  So with that in mind I calculated that if he takes I will grab his h pawn and then we wind up with an exchange.  This does wind up happening.  And I thought it would delay the loss but this time I'm not going to last much longer unfortunately.  
64,0,64,Rg1,b'8/p6B/6p1/2k5/2P5/1KP5/8/6r1 w - -',The reason is because of this move.  I kept in mind that if the R came off of the g file I would get the pawn.  But this wasn't hope chess anymore because I knew for a fact that a strong player like him wouldn't give up that pawn.  I just didn't know what he'd play but this is really ugly because with his R all the way down like this Bert will just keep advancing and when the pawn gets down far enough he can move the R.  In which case black will be able promote with no way to stop it.  With that in mind I'm almost ready to resign but will still see what I can do first.
65,0,65,Rg2,b'6B1/p7/6p1/2k5/2P5/1KP5/6r1/8 w - -',Still giving protection to the pawn.  But seeing that he played this as opposed to 48...g5 I'm not ready to resign yet.  If however he had and does decide to advance his pawn a square further that's when I'll resign.
66,0,66,4Bd5,b'8/p7/6p1/2kB4/2P5/1KP5/6r1/8 b - -',Prolonging the game by only one move.  So I start going to on the offense.  I'm back to hope chess though since I'm just hoping that he gets the R off the file so I can get his knob.  This time it happens.  
67,0,67,5Be4,b'8/p7/6p1/2k5/2P1B3/1KP5/5r2/8 b - -',So now I go for his pawn.
68,0,68,5g5,b'8/p7/8/2k3p1/2P1B3/1KP5/5r2/8 w - -',Not to my surprise at all he plays this.  I resign because I cannot stop the g pawn do to his R.  And Bert is going to promote no matter what I do.  In addition mate will eventually come after he promotes.  I know because as HW I've had to study similar mating sequences with Jack.  In a situation like this when you have a R and the pawn promotes the opponent can soon deliver check.  Unlike before it keeps on happening until he or she mates.  The moral that Bert gave which I know is true as Jack taught me is that you have to be aware of passed pawns as they are very dangerous.  What's implied is that if you're not you'll lose because he or she will be able to promote with no way to prevent it.

93,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',currently im happy with my result in the tournament. its given me a nice annotation against the leader of the tournament and im placed second.  i can still win but i left my victory in the hands of the current leader. Where he has to lose his last two games and i must win my final 1 to win.  if he loses 1 and wins 1 we tie etc..

Although the result was good looking back it was probably not a good idea to trade my good dark-square B.  I was so focused on potential attacking possibilities for White down the open h-file or against my K that I played too defensively.  I also didn't like the way b5 got turned into a target.  I thought White could have caused more trouble for that backward pawn.  I was glad that I was able to take advantage of White's mistakes but feel I made too many of my own."

174,5,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Of course I won't allow it because I had a bad experience when Mr. Arboite who was at the time in Jack's chess club but as an assisstant coach.  Well when he took like that and I took back I found myself at a disadvantage.

I don't think so because she could've grabbed my N and if I were to take back I'd be left with doubled pawns.  Instead I believe that best was 5.a3  Sure it's against guidelines but nowadays when faced with this I'd deviate so that once the opponent runs back I don't have to worry about doubled pawns.  Since this is not an endgame and noone has won anything yet doubled pawns could be problematic this time around.  I go by the idea of pawn structures as I learned and told you about and if I have it so early otherwise and black could avoid Sue would have a healthier pawn structure already giving her an advantage.
178,5,5,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',However she castles which is also good.

180,5,7,d6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I was thinking along the lines of 6...exd4 and then would come 7.Nxd4 Nxd4 8.Qxd4 and everything is even.  However this move is just as good because the e pawn is still protected so black found the right response nonetheless.  I am already very impressed with her and I'm usually not impressed so early.  In fact I became impresses as early as her last move.
181,5,8,Qd3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/1b1PP3/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',?! So now I put pressure on the d file.  Sometimes I feel it's ok to deviate from guidelines a little as I have seen with GM's.  But I'm giving as an inaccuracy.  Once I deviated about bringing the Q out too early once development was complete and lost pretty quickly.  Instead better was 7.Bg3 and now that N is pinned.  Then she might play 7...h6 and I can then keep the pin with 8.Bh4 and no good after would be 8...g5  Sure I'd be indirectly forced to play 9.Bg3 to avoid the loss of a piece but her K winds up exposed.  After reading comments from C++ I intially thought that was no big deal but I lost a game against Jack by doing something like that and leaving the K in a bad spot.  In it he said that ...h6 was allright but ...g5 was not playable for that reason.  Although I played right after that it was too late since the Q was able to come in and cause damage.

By playing this I take and in order to avoid the loss of a piece she has to mess up her pawn structures as I'll explain.  Bear in mind that a player will benefit from a healthier pawn structure as I've learned from GM Susan Polgar.
185,5,12,Qe7,b'r4rk1/1pp1qppp/p1Bp1n2/4p1B1/1b1PP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? This however is her first blunder.  9...bxc6 was indirectly forced as that would've compensated and prevented from taking on b7.  Nontheless her position would be compromised for the reason outlined earlier.  But it's better then the move played as this loses a piece and a pawn.
186,5,13,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/1Bp1qppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/1b1PP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',? It's very understandable why Sue moved here.  But the problem is that it loses yet another pawn.  Best was 10...Ra7 and not only is the pawn protected but my B is attacked.  So she does get tempo in return.
187,5,14,Rba8,b'r4rk1/2p1qppp/B2p1n2/4p1B1/1b1PP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! Probably trying to get tempo.  I think the idea was to get tempo but there is an overload which black did not see.  That is being the Q as that adds a defender to a6 so that I don't have to pull back.
188,5,15,1Qb5,b'r4rk1/2p1qppp/B2p1n2/1Q2p1B1/1b1PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Therefore studying and applying those variations from a private annotation which I saw in a GM game so I reattack.  Yes I have studied others but where a piece is actually attacked because they don't have an extra defender so the opponent does retreat but in a way that reattacks.  It's very common in GM games as I studied in a game from Susan Polgar which I recently annotated as well.
189,5,16,1Bxc3,b'r4rk1/2p1qppp/B2p1n2/1Q2p1B1/3PP1b1/2b2N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! Inaccruacy.  Sure I wind up with doubled pawns.  But in this position that's no big deal as I'm also ahead a piece and two pawns.  The problem here is that by taking she's liquidating pieces when behind.  So later on that will increase my advantage.
190,5,17,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/2p1qppp/B2p1n2/1Q2p1B1/3PP1b1/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Not at all surprised with this move.

192,5,19,1Qe6,b'1r3rk1/2p2ppp/B2pqn2/4p1B1/3PP1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! Same idea.  It's with the overload.  But this is an inaccuracy because of my next move.
193,5,20,1d5,b'1r3rk1/2p2ppp/B2pqn2/3Pp1B1/4P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And yes without overdoing this time around I applied the same variations that I saw in that private annotation which was at the time my favorite.  Otherwise I would've taken on e5 forcing a pawn exchange.  But a lot of GM's instead of exchanging the way I mentioned play something like this.  So they advance the pawn further up and attack the opponents piece.  At first I wasn't sure why but now it makes sense.  The plan and as for forcing moves which I recently learned is the gain of tempo.
194,5,21,1Qd7,b'1r3rk1/2pq1ppp/B2p1n2/3Pp1B1/4P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! Best was 15...Qe7 and now if 16.Bxf6 she can retake with 16...Qxf6 strengthening her position a little as the Q is stronger as I also learned in that annotation but much earlier.  But with this move I know destroy her pawn structure around the K and it becomes exposed.  Not a super big deal since sometimes you can play with an exposed K as I recently learned.  Plus damalfi would say that I'm focusing too much on general's if I called this a blunder just with an exposed since a similar position happened in a different annotation where I was over critical.  But with that the bigger picture is that it still enables me to liquidate pieces while ahead.
195,5,22,Qa4,b'1r3rk1/2p2ppp/B2p1B2/3Pp3/q3P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',? Now it's safe to call this a mistake.  I understand the logic as I used to make this error a lot back when I was about her rating.  It was for attacking something and gaining tempo.  This works at GM level but even with someone at about my rating it's generally not a good idea to do that.  Best was 16...gxf6 and now Sue would not have lost an extra pawn yet.  But with this move however black must lose another pawn.
196,5,23,1Bc4,b'1r3r2/2p2pkp/3p4/3Pp3/q1B1P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',To put pressure on the a2-g8 square with the idea that my B is covering I believe 9 squares.  The idea as easy19 puts it which is also basic is how many squares does your B cover?  It's also an important concept because I recently discovered that the more squares your B covers the more your advantages increase.
197,5,24,1Kh8,b'1r3r1k/2p2p1p/3p4/3Pp3/q1B1P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',To protect her K which I agree is very important.

And despite the disadvantages or blunders I'm still very impressed with how she's playing this time around.  This is very unusual as after the student has a disadvantage it's hard to make me impressed but Sue is a different story however as she's still playing in my opinion very well.
200,5,27,2Rb4,b'r4r1k/2p2p1p/3p4/3Pp3/qRB1P1b1/2PQ1N2/P1P2PPP/5RK1 b - -',Typical of what you see from GM's one way of doing so is attacking the opponents Q.  It's not however for the thrill of it but when you do and see that's a difficult situation for the opponent that's when you go for it.  And my idea is trying to think like a Grandmaster.  And as noted I played through a similar variation.  I also kept in mind that black cannot take on a2 due to my B.
201,5,28,2Nd2,b'r4r1k/2pq1p1p/3p4/3Pp3/1RB1P1b1/2PQ4/P1PN1PPP/5RK1 b - -',Well I was going to move this now seeing that I'm not in a pin.  I also learned that if a stronger players N is near his home square like this you often increase your advantages.  I know of someone that increased his edge by doing that.  Also although I didn't expect it so soon I anticipated that at some point black would play ...c6 so this move does overload my B.  Another reason from what I studied why stronger players like to bring their N near the homesquare.
202,5,29,2c6,b'r4r1k/3q1p1p/2pp4/3Pp3/1RB1P1b1/2PQ4/P1PN1PPP/5RK1 w - -',"? The reason I didn't anticipate this now however is that it is a mistake.  By playing this white wins a pawn.  I'm not sure what the best move would've been but as a friend told me before he left ""Almost any move is better then this."""
203,5,30,Qxc6,b'r4r1k/5p1p/2qp4/4p3/1RB1P1b1/2PQ4/P1PN1PPP/5RK1 w - -',?? Blunder.  Black had to be aware of this skewer.  Now I don't just attack but in order to protect her Q Sue must lose her R for a B in addition to what she's lost.
204,5,31,2h3,b'5r1k/5p1p/r2p4/3Bp3/1R2P1b1/2P4P/P1PN1PP1/5RK1 b - -',Keeping this in mind and that we're nearing the end game.  I don't just play this for the thrill and giggles of attacking but my long term goal is activating my K and using it as a weapon.
205,5,32,2Bd7,b'5r1k/3b1p1p/r2p4/3Bp3/1R2P3/2P4P/P1PN1PP1/5RK1 w - -',Most common was 25...Bh5 but there's nothing wrong with this move.

207,5,34,2Rg8,b'6rk/3b1p1p/r2p4/3Bp3/1R2P3/2P4P/P1PN1PP1/1R4K1 w - -',? Probably to put pressure near the K.  However she just has a R near that square so there's no threats.  And this move is a mistake as it loses another pawn.
208,5,35,Be6,b'6rk/5B1p/r2pb3/4p3/1R2P3/2P4P/P1PN1PP1/1R4K1 w - -',?? Trying to win my a pawn.  Usually it's not bad and considering that one would want to gain tempo it would be very understandable.  But this is a blunder as it loses yet another piece.
209,5,36,Re8,b'4r2k/7p/r2pB3/4p3/1R2P3/2P4P/P1PN1PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Obviously going after my B.

And now just using memory techniques from chess puzzles as it was before those end game quizzes it's about confining the K until I have a mate.  While not here at the time I didn't realize how centralization or opposition played a role.  But as I recently learned don't get too stuck on it as that's often more then you need to force a win.

If so there would have been played 7... dxe 8. fxe Ng4 and I couldn't defend my pawn. Another reason to play Bd3 is that it's an obvios place for the bishop to stay. I better wait before playing Nf3. That way my opponent wouldn't play Bg4 and maybe exchange his bishop. So there appears to be problem its development. If placed on d7 the Knight from would have a hard time reaching the center. If the Knight goes on d7 the bishop would have nowhere to move. Also If 7... Bg4 8. Qc2 and now Kbd7 is bad because the bishop dies after h3 and g4.

By playing Bb3 I prevent exchange and the c7 knight from moving (If Ka6 I would take on b5) and that way also preventing e8 from moving on c7 in just a few moves. Thats a big problem for the black cause it means that his rook on f8 would remain inactive. At the same time I might move mine from b4 to the center. Also I have a easy plan for playing Nd4 with tempo and then Nc6.

But here I think I said that 3.Bb5 is most common as it's the Ruy Lopez which is why I played.  I was not going to play the Siclian because as I learned you don't want to get your student too used to that since it's a much more complicated line.  In reality there's nothing wrong with this move as I believe Two Nights Opening.  Could be quite wrong with what it is but that's not the most important.  What matters is how you teach.
251,7,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now we have the well known Four Knights Defense.

Worth noting is that until the next move I was surprised and thought she played extremely well.  That however is about to change so I became over optimisic but the thing is that I always like to see and think of the best of my student as it's about the student feeling comfortable and gaining confidence as time goes on.

And this is how he does it.  I always ask myself why and can't figure out the logic.  Sure it develops as it's a central but why create a pin on yourself.  However he always does this so there must be a good reason and I often find myself later with a disadvantage.  And that is something I kept in mind.
254,7,4,Nh4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp3/4P2N/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',? Her First mistake.  Don't know why Sue played this.  Actually while I don't remember what exactly was said I approximate.  Sure as noted I don't have a pictogram but I have a memory very close to that and if only things went right into long term memory then I would have it.  However what's more important and worth noting is that this is her first mistake.  Let's go back in time where a N on the rim is indeed grim.  First at that rating yes it is important to follow most of the general guidelines and not deviate unless extenuating circumstances which in a case like that rarely happen with who you're against.  That is because this move enables me to win a center pawn and right after an exchange which is liquidation of pieces.  @knightrider62: This is something important to learn but liquidate=an exchange of pieces when behind.  It is known to give the opponent whose ahead the advantage because if it should boil to an endgame it generally boils down to a few pawns and the K.  Now in general it only takes one pawn to make the difference between and loss and if you've liquidated and exchanged pieces when behind then you have less to defend with.  That's why when the opponent is ahead he or she has an advantage.  It's also important to go back to what I learned from Susan Polgar.  That GM Karpov who was at the time the world champion lost a game by placing his N on the rim which allowed his opponent to fork his B and N and consequently Karpov lost a piece.  So following the guidelines is very important.  And as you recently asked me if your opponent dosen't follow them and goes for something unsound the best way is to calmly continue development and then you wind up with the advantage.  That I knew but was still reviewed with Susan.
255,7,5,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4n2N/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',?? @knightrider62: The move played is very understandable but this is one of the times where you had to deviate from the guidelines.  Yes K safety is important but protecting the N on h4 takes priority.  It would still result in liquidation but that's better then what happens.  With that being said you had to play 6.Nf3 as it was the only way to protect.  Let's look at other possibilities and possible variations that I'm about to come up with.  You might think that N could've retreated to other squares but there are only two other outposts aside from what I mentioned as it's limited which is also why that guideline is important.  If you played 6.Nf3 which looks good and safe black immediately captures with 6...Bxf5  In addition 6.Ng6 wouldn't have helped because I'd recapture with 6...fxg6 and forget about my doubled pawns.  Winning a piece is far worse then that.  But yes no matter how you look at it anything else other then 6.Nf3 loses the N as it did. 
256,7,6,Nxe4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4N2q/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White thought that she had won something back which I understand perfectly as that's what I thought even after surpassing 1000.  It took me until my rating was between 1050-1100 to remember this.  But what's important is overload which is defenders and attacker.  And I have an extra defender so now that white took I immeidately liquidate with my next move.

And one reason I also played this was so that Sue would learn and know what do when you have a pin like this.  As Jack says it's the most common way to break it.  But then there are exception when the B can't go back.  So what would you do?  The solution would be with ...a6
259,7,9,d3,b'r3kb1r/pppb1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4p2q/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Want's to exchange.  I would've given this as an inaccuracy because I thought that any exchanges were bad when you're down.  But as I now know this only applies when pieces are exchanged.  With pawns however it's another story.  With that I view it as a good move because it develops and now helps control the center allowing room for the DSB.

265,7,15,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/pppb1ppp/3b4/1B2p3/3n3q/8/PPpBQPPP/2R1R1K1 w kq -',The reason behind this is because black wins yet another piece with the discovered.  Let's look at one move and variation.  Also possible was 12...e4 with a threat against the K with an immeidate threat.  I didn't play it however because I viewed as unsound.  That's because for me the reason would be hope chess and as we know hope chess is quite bad.  As I would only play that for mate and the idea is that we don't want unsound aggression.  So at that I predicted that if I played this my student would respond with 13.h3 in which case the plan would not work.  But winning more material however I deemed to be real chess as it's imminent.  Note: at the time I didn't know any of those terms Hope Chess Flip Coin Chess and Real Chess.  As of early May remembering what C++ said what I was doing and where it applied as that was still a weakness that's when it became second nature.  However I do not the basics that you don't just do something for mate as it's unsound.

The idea that you could keep one pawn in front of another like I did with Mary until one promotes.  With my R however that wasn't possible.  And this is so far the biggest blunder of the entire.  Although there were some mistakes.  But this move loses a Q for N in addition to what's been lost.  For that very reason the Q had to get out of harm's way.  @Knightrider: What there is to learn here and from other moves is something that C++ said some time ago which was one of the very few things that I did remember.  That is ""Consider all threats made by your opponent checks and captures."""

Although I didn't know the term at the time the idea being here is overload which is adding the defender.  So in addition the way to putting pressure on those squares is with defenders.  BTW I bring up that term because Susan said that it's important to know terms that I once was not familar with until recently.  One of them being overload which I learned from a different annotator.
268,7,18,1Bf3,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/4p3/b6q/P4B2/1PpB1PPP/2R1R1K1 b kq -',This is the one threat that I overlooked and I admit that it shouldn't have happened.  Coaches and mentors generally won't overlook threats like that.
269,7,19,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/4p3/b6q/P4B2/1PpB1PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',"? I was more then interested in K safety and guidelines.  The idea being wasn't just to connect R's but the long term plan was to bring both of my R's on one file as that's known to be dangerous. That's how Jack defeated me despite being down a Q early on.  I kept it in mind but I now know a weakness at that which I'm familiar with and the same thing happens when playing through GM annotations.  The idea is being able to apply them in your games.  But you have to know when it's too much as overanalyzing can cause problems.  Just like the tempo I lost in that coaching game that you saw.  But a better example was my game against jstevens1 as some of you saw in ""the jkarp campaign""  How did I enable the fork.  Well I saw that Joann's pawn was pinned so I placed my Q there as an extra attacker keeping in mind.  It's mainly because I played through several variations in those GM games where the pawn right near the K is pinned so the variation included bringing that extra piece in the pin.  The only difference which was vital is that there was no safe spot for the K as this was from a private annotation which at the time was my favorite.  But that's because the opponent didn't develop properly so that pin would've been an immediate killer.  But in the game with Joann the K could move and when it did I had to face an awful fork which as she notes that's when it all went downhill.  So the lesson is that sometimes what you see and play through might not be so good in that particular game.  And that applies here with this mistake.  "
270,7,20,e4,b'r4rk1/pBp2ppp/3b4/8/b3p2q/P7/1PpB1PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',"However I'm aware of the threat and now that I know what's going on this is where I decide to play that.  The idea being as I very recently learned what it actually called a combo.  I always thought it was gambit but it's not.  It's a combo where you sac material sometimes a R or the Q for something much worse.  That's because a common mistake is to take as I've made that mistake before.  The idea being that ""To take is a mistake.""  I anticipated and my calculation was that Sue would play 17.Bxa8 in which case I'd mate very quickly."
271,7,21,1Re3,b'r4rk1/pBp2ppp/3b4/8/b3p2q/P3R3/1PpB1PPP/2R3K1 b - -',"?? But she doesn't.  However this is just as much of a blunder as taking.  In fact I don't know exactly why white played.  But my guess would be to harrass the Q.  However this mistake will result in the same thing that would've occurred if she took.  With that being said mate is now inevitable.  Better was 17.h3 to prevent the threat but best was 17.g3 which also prevents mate but at the same time gains time and wins the R at the same time because I'd have to retreat and then you take.  After which white compensates and gets a little of that advantage back.  @knightrider62: Whenever you play a move you have to ask what's being threatened and where that threat is occuring.  If it's something like where I threaten the K then you have to ""Open Up""  That means move the pawn right where the K sits to ""give it air to breathe.""  In this case I wouldn't be able to check.  But usually they can check and when they do you can get out with the K.  With this move however there is no way out."

Yes it's probably main theory in the English ( I haven't checked yet ) but it feels so meek. I suppose this is because I myself play the queen gambit which of course starts with d4 and thus I'm not accustomed to the entire d3 idea.

This move isn't necessarily the best move but I decided that I didn't want to allow my opponent to be in his comfort zone any longer so i tried breaking open the center.

Not only are you blocking the good diagonal of White's light squared bishop giving it less scope but you also make d3 a target in the future.Yes you get a little center control due to it but I don't consider it adequate compensation.
302,9,6,1Qd8,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I was pondering on retreating to d7 or d6 but I didn't want to obstruct my bishop and if Qd6 is played then he gets Bf4 with tempo which I didn't want to allow so I opt for retreating to d8.

The idea behind Rb1 is simple. My bishop on g7 is attacking the pawn on b2 and as a result his dark squared bishop can't develop so he plays Rb1 so he can develop it in the future. That being said Qc2 accomplished the exact same thing but also threatens the c5 pawn and develops his queen so I don't understand why he didn't just play Qc2.
304,9,8,1Nb4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/1n2P3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',This move ensures I win a pawn since it attacks both a2 and d3 which got weakened as a result of the previous e4 move and he can't defend both.

I was thinking whether or not I could get away with for example Nxd3 but for some reason I didn't end up playing it. Maybe because I was scared of moves like Qc2 Nb4 Rfd1 but looking back to it it isn't much to fear. The idea behind b6 is to not only protect c5 and a a result make his dark squared bishop less valuable but also to play Ba6 if he would play d4. Example: 13. d4 Ba6 14. Re1 Nd3 15. Rf1 Nxb2 16. Re1 Nd3. It doesn't win a lot of material for Black but it's something White will have to be wary of for quite some time.

The reason being because it blocks of the escape of the White queen and maybe it'll be possible in the future to win the queen. The queen would have nowhere to run after Ba6. Bf5 is played to target the weak d3 pawn which is logical enough I suppose.

He needs to make these type of moves since if he waits I'll capture the d-pawn then win the e-pawn trade everything off and you're suddenly down in an endgame with 2 pawns down.

Not only was Bxe4 probably better but maybe I could have just played Nxd3 here. I didn't go for it since I was a little scared off creating a weakness on the g-file but looking back on it this isn't that big of a deal considering the limited amount of pieces White would have left. I also would be up 2 pawns meaning an easy endgame.

The problem with Rxf3 for White is that he can't really ignore it. If you decide to ignore it with for example bxc5 then Rxf2 follow and my queen will eventually enter the fray via Qd4. As if that isn't bad enough the pawn on the 3th rank can potentially promote if he isn't careful. And even if he finds some way out he's 2 pawn down like before he captured my knight. Therefore it's really hard to resist the temptation of taking the rook. Capture the rook and pray that you can flee somewhere like for example get all the way to the c1 square?

If he were to go try and escape via b5 then I'd play c4 again and White's king it in for a bad time checkmate is unavoidable in that position. Kxb6 is the most prolonging move.
336,9,40,3Qf6+,b'2r4k/4p2p/1K3qp1/2p5/1P6/3P2p1/2QB1P1P/bR1R4 w - -',Putting the king in check once again. Going 30.Kb5 means I plays Qc6+. After he moves to c4 I play bxc4+ which is a discovered check. If he plays Kb3 I plays Qxc2+ which is checkmate with Ra8 after he flees to a3. Kb7 gets met by Qc6 which is also a forced checkmate. 31.Ka7 gets met with 31. Rc7+ 32.Kb8 Qb6+ 33. Ka8 Ra7#. 6 seconds left on my clock as I try my hardest to think of a forced mate if he moves to a5. I press the clock and my time goes back to 36 seconds. I haven't found a plan for a5 yet but know I can come up with something given that I create a minute for me to work with. It helps enormously that the next few moves are rather obvious.
337,9,41,Ra8+,b'r6k/4p2p/5qp1/K1p5/1P6/3P2p1/2QB1P1P/bR1R4 w - -',Limiting him back to b5. I need to get rid of my own c-pawn in order to win his queen though I can't help but wonder if there's a forced mate here.
338,9,42,Rc8+,b'2r4k/4p2p/q5p1/2K5/1P6/3P2p1/2QB1P1P/bR1R4 w - -',Winning the queen. Like one of my friends sometimes says: win the queen first give checkmate later
339,9,43,3Rbxa1,b'7k/4p2p/q5p1/3K4/1P6/3P2p1/2rB1P1P/R2R4 b - -',Not a bad move removing my pesky bishop but White is already hopelessly lost. I think his king being in check every move since move 26 ( with the exception of move 34 where I win a queen ) says enough about how hopeless the situation for White is.
340,9,44,3Qxd3+,b'7k/4p2p/6p1/3K4/1P6/3q2p1/2rB1P1P/R2R4 w - -',The checks continue.

342,9,46,3Ra8+,b'R6k/4p2p/4K1p1/8/1P6/3q2p1/3r1P1P/3R4 b - -',Trying to get some counterplay but sadly this one check is all he's going to get.
343,9,47,3Ra7,b'8/R3p1kp/4K1p1/8/1P6/3q2p1/3r1P1P/3R4 b - -',I start looking at Qf5 which is checkmate in 1 after Kxe7. I find a mate in 1 in Re2+ though.
344,9,48,3Re2#,b'8/R3p1kp/4K1p1/8/1P6/3q2p1/4rP1P/3R4 w - -',And with this the game ends. It was a close one closer then I dare to admit. I'm really happy that I found Rxf3 over the board. All the moves before that however were questionable at times. The tournament is almost nearing the end. I just need to play one more game against someone with a similar rating. After having hard matchups every round it seems they've finally taking mercy on me and let me play similar rated opponents.

393,12,8,e5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnbppp/2p2n2/4p3/2NPP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black must counter-attack in the centre or white will slowly squeeze black's awkward position. Pawn breaks are one of the key ideas when you have a small amount of space and exchanging pieces is another objective when in a tight area as the less pieces you have the less space you need.

His lone bishop sits on its starting square blocked in by the knight and with no real good squares or diagonals to aim for as well as disconnecting the two rooks while my pieces are on great squares and each has its own job and ideas for future improvement. Next black's position is very cramped his only hope of gaining space is pawn breaks and he lacks any good ones at the moment. We now see black struggle to place his pieces on good squares and attempt to gain space by pushing pawns which leaves multiple weaknesses in his position.

725,24,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Lately I’ve been playing nothing but the English opening.  I’ve found that not only does it offer white good long-term chances in a drawn-out positional battle but occasionally it offers relatively quick tactical victories if the opponent obliges.

I reasoned that if ...cxd then I would have a very nice center with lots of space there (after exd).  And if ...c5 I would still have a nice central space advantage with a locked center allowing me play on the kingside if I wanted it.  I had second thoughts about the placement of my dark-squared bishop and didn't want to commit it yet.  It seemed okay where it was for the moment exerting some influence on the kingside even though still undeveloped.

I strongly considered the obvious Bg5 but thought it would simply invite h6 putting the question to my bishop and “forcing” the Bishop into taking the Knight only to be replaced with another Knight (an excellent defender of the kingside).  Since I was really hoping to dislodge any and all kingside knights I held off and decided to begin with the queen and perhaps prepare g4-g5.
736,24,11,1Nc5,b'3rrbk1/1bq2ppp/pp1p1n2/2nPpN2/P1P5/1PN2QP1/5PBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Although this looks very logical I think this was a mistake.  I was really hoping for this actually and was surprised my opponent played it.  Perhaps he just didn’t think there was a lot of danger to his kingside which does appear well-protected with the knight and bishop but it turns out that he really isn’t as well-defended as might appear and could have used this knight in the defense.

I thought that my opponent would have surely seen the dangers of Bxf6 and might just simply retreat the knight right back to d7 again.  I can’t remember which GM said it or exactly what he said but something like “Don’t go looking for baubles on the side of the road when there are more important things going on.”

Even though it is less forcing it causes more damage.  Obviously the bishop can't take the knight because after Qg4 it is mate next move.
742,24,17,2Nf5,b'2brrbk1/2q2p1p/pp1p1B2/3PpN2/P1P5/2N2QP1/5PBP/n3R1K1 b - -',1-0.  Black resigns as there really is nowhere to hide.  A bad mistake on my part would have been the obvious 20. Nxe8 or 20. Bxd8.  Instead the attack on the exposed king had to be continued and bringing the knight back to f5 was the way to do it.  Now if the black bishop doesn’t take the white knight on f5 it’s mate soon after 21. Qg4+.  And if 20….BxNf5 then after 21. QxBf5 followed by 22. Be4 it’s either mate on h7 or black has to give up his queen (after 20…Qc4 and 21…Qxe4).

Now against cxd5 I respond with cxd5 (or exd5!? if I'm looking for a risky game for a fast win). White's next moves demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the Stonewall position.

Hemming in the DSB is only thematic when the queenside knight is still on b1 and the queen is on d1 that way Ba3 can be organized with b3 and if Qe7 then Bb2 and Qc1. Here it just seems like White's DSB is simply inferior.

770,26,7,Bb2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PBQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The only decent square for the DSB but once again White should consider trying to castle with 8. Bd3 or 8. Be2. Castling queenside is risky since all 3 B to D pawns have moved and Black can exploit the king rather quickly.
771,26,8,a6,b'rnbq1rk1/1p4pp/p1pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PBQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Playing for 9...b5 a thematic attack to open the c-file which is better since it is where the queen currently lies (as well as a pin-able knight). Also discourages cxd5 as Nb5 is no longer an option afterwards.

Although the 2-Tempo bishop would be technically a good trade for the 1-Tempo bishop I want to keep my DSB with my pawn structure as it is especially since his structure is weak on the queenside dark squares. Stockfish recommends 9...a5 but as it doesn't threaten anything immediately and makes a future b5 push harder I opted against it. I already have plenty of control of b4 and want to respond to cxd5 with cxd5.

The knight move is a prime example of over-stretching: White should be focused on castling and finishing his development. This move makes the knight a weakness and even if he should retreat the knight later I will have gained a few tempos on his knight moves and have a better grip on future e5 maneuvers. 
775,26,12,1Nbd7,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1pbpn2/3pNp2/P1PP4/1PN1P3/1BQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',The obvious reply. Putting scrutiny on the knight on e5 while developing to a completely natural square.

White neglects all opening principles with this (and the last) move: don't move a piece twice in the opening don't retreat unless there is a clear advantage etc. White once again has left his king 2 moves from castling to safety and this time it's too late.

In this case Black's development is complete aside from the LSB and the a8 rook so it is here where you must calculate how to punish White's play. This is the critical position where you must spend time to calculate: I spent about 10-15 minutes ensuring that I had found the best move. In this case the weakness on b4 specifically the a5-e1 diagonal comes back to haunt White. Now he must tread carefully in order to not be crushed quickly. Stockfish eval (-1.1) Depth 23

[Dummy move 22. a5] 22...Qxe3 (23. Kxe3?? Bc5#)(23. Kf1 Rd2!-+) 23. Ke1 - and black can proceed with several plans: 23...b5 to open the queenside 23...e4 to open the center 23...Be6 to develop and threaten c4 etc. It's all losing for White."

Qe2 fxe3+ (-+) and the queen cannot recapture or it will be won via deflection: 26. Qxe3? Rf8+ 27. Ke2 Bg4+]. 23. g6 does not lose any advantage but does not gain anything either. It actually probably slows down any potential kingside play in the future. Either way you learn from your mistakes.

When it is unclear how to continue the attack many lower-rated players lash out but experts and masters just improve their position. All of White's pieces are optimally developed and there is no clear plan for White to do anything to attack. I'll just simply improve my last piece and begin the vice-grip.

The LSB can support g5-g4 or h5-h4-h3 or itself go to h3 should the g2-pawn move. Be3 is now a powerful idea to increase my grip on the d-file. White is now in cue the music dire straits.

I never know why players like to play these kinds of positions out it seems absolutely hopeless and no fun at all. It frankly is disrespectful to a degree (at least OTB) as it is basically saying that your opponent's time is not valuable and that you think they could mess up a position this winning (Stockfish eval -16.5).

814,27,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',and so it starts with e5! ive played 3 games so far with this gambit won the first 1 won this one which was my second game with this gambit and lost the third with a big mistep where i was leading after my opponent blundered and i happily returned him the favor 2 moves later which was game costing for me though in exchange ><
815,27,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',so wierd a game where i start with e5!  im usually a nc6 player d5 or e6 player. i think the 3 latvian gambit games ive played are the only three in my history that i start with e5.
816,27,3,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',and here is the f5! i believe the usual reply by white is nxe5 or be4

819,27,6,Nxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',hmm odd reply. but this game has taken a semblance to an opening im used to so im comfortable with what to reply.

821,27,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',unanticipated reply. most of the time whites will send their knight to g3.
822,27,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',and so i develop+ protect my e5 pawn. this game has a colorado gambit feel. except of having my LSB on f5 and my e pawn undevelopped. they have swap move order.
823,27,10,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',hmm i wonder if d4 is stronger.
824,27,11,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',so i develop my other knight

877,27,64,4a4#,b'5rk1/7p/6p1/1pp1Q3/p2p4/PK1P3P/5q2/8 w - -', all comments appreciated.  thanks again Ion for turning me onto the latvian gambit. i dedicate this nice pawn mate to you achieved with almost one of my first games with this opening
878,28,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I would've played 2.Nf3 because that's what I'm most used to as I like the open variation.  But I'm very used to the Morra Gambit as I have played against this even against ION.
879,28,1,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Of course black accepts because it is a gambit so it wins a pawn.  But seeing that she gave and sometimes you benefit from a combination which is the sac of material to get an advantage it'll be interesting to see what Susan has in mind.
880,28,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',She wants to exchange which black will accept.  I think the idea is so that she can play Nc3 as c3 is blocked off by the d pawn.  So white wants to eliminate that obstacle.
881,28,3,dxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I'm not surprised that black accepts.
882,28,4,Nxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So my instincts were correct.  That idea behind the exchange was to enable white to play Nc3.
883,28,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black has similar ideas with the idea of developing the N.
884,28,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Understandable but I would've gotten aggressive with 5.Bb5
885,28,7,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I don't know why she played this as opposed to 5...e5 as that's what I would've played.  But unlike in your games sometimes you don't know why a GM made a move which is part of theory and thus also a way to learn as it's then up to you to figure out why that move was played.
886,28,8,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Not surprisingly she's getting ready to castle.
887,28,9,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I believe to prevent the annoying 7.Bb5
888,28,10,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',But my instincts were spot on as this was white's plan with her last move.  So I'm not surprised and I'm pretty sure that even if black didn't play 6...a6 she would've played this.  Now there's something say about that which is why I find ...a6 questionable as well as other moves.  White already has a noticeable lead in development and her K is safe.  Let's count Susan only needs to bring out one more piece before development is complete.  Whereas Sirko has only developed one piece and hasn't castled yet.  Therefore white should have a noticeable advantage but anything can happen in a GM game.  And it's too soon to conclude anything because as everyone pointed there are in general exceptions and one cannot stuck on development.  With that being said things are already starting to become interesting.
889,28,11,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1npp3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',The problem here I don't know if general or not but they say you shouldn't do this is that black is cramming in her DSB.  This is similar in most QP games when you bring the c N early in the fact that you are blocking off the c pawn.  Well something similar with what I mentioned could be said here.  With that I think that white has a bigger advantage then even a move earlier.
890,28,12,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1npp3/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Completing development.
891,28,13,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p1npp3/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',But as noted her DSB is crammed.
892,28,14,Qe2,b'r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p1npp3/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Now her R's are connected which is also something you'd want to do.
893,28,15,Na5,b'r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p2pp3/n7/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Trying to win the her LSB.  I heard of this happening with novices and I always thought it was only with them.  But after playing through at least one possible variation in almost every GM annotation I realize that this is also common with GM's as well.  That you attack a piece and I figured out the idea.  It's really to gain tempo since time is perhaps one of the most important things as damalfi has previously noted.
894,28,16,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/n7/4PB2/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Developing and preparing to castle.  So there was afterall more to this story then meets the eye.  In other words it was afterall too soon to conclude that anyone had the advantage so I'm glad that I inferred as opposed to conclude as I would've been wrong.
895,28,17,1Rfd1,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/n7/4PB2/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',I'm not exactly sure why Susan played this.  Probably to add pressure on the d file with the B since the LSB is protected.  I would've however played 11.Rfe1 because the idea which I recently learned is that GM's often put the R directly behind the Q and the idea being is to add more pressure and sometimes create threats that have at times proved to be overwhelming.
896,28,18,1e5,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/n3p3/4PB2/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',As noted earlier to gain tempo.

898,28,20,1Nxe5,b'r2qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/n3N1B1/4P3/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',"Ok there must be a plan here but I'm not exactly sure what it is.  But Susan does make the combination with this sac.  However whatever the plan is it must be good because in a previous lesson she implied that GM's will often sac for a beautiful combination.  And as she recently said in the course I'm taking ""making a beautiful sacrifice of material like this is every chess players dream come true.""  That is especially true for GM's though. 
"
899,28,21,1Bxf6,b'r2qk2r/1p2bppp/p3bB2/n3p3/4P3/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',Offering another sac.
900,28,22,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p3bB2/n3p3/4P3/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',But now that black castled it is safe to conclude that 14...gxf5?? would've lost immediately.  And seeing what black did we now know that the K would've become exposed had she played that with no way out of it.  With that being said black made the right choice.  However black will lose an important pawn in return as it is right in the center.
901,28,23,Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/p3bb2/n3B3/4P3/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',I don't know why Sirko wants to liquidate pieces as she is down a pawn.  With that being said I'm not surprised that white accepts.
902,28,24,1e5,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3bq2/n3P3/8/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',And as noted I'm also not surprised with this move either.  Not to mention that I studied one of those variations in a GM game.   I remember it was by my favorite annotator in the game between Carlson and Topalov where I variation that involved a move like this was mentioned.
903,28,25,1Qe4,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3b3/n3P1q1/4Q3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Now Susan in one of her books I had an a solution on forks mentioned about a mate threat just like this.  And it's not unsound as Susan would not never make a threat if it involved unsound aggression.  Instead the threat is very difficult to drive off and when black does so while I'm not exactly sure how it will negatively affect her position even more.  With that being said I think it's pretty safe to infer that white is winning.  However I'm not concluding and is by no means a fact but rather an opinion based on what I've studied from this teacher.
904,28,26,1Rac1,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3b2q/n3P3/4Q3/2NB4/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',I believe the idea is adding pressure to the c file.  
905,28,27,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4Q3/2NB4/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',I do not know why she played this.  Personally I would've played 19...Rac8 with the plan being to put pressure on the N.
906,28,28,2Bb1,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4Q3/2N5/PP3PPP/1BRR2K1 b - -',But this move makes sense as now the R can move up the ranks which would prove to be powerful.  In this particular position I'm not sure exactly how but it would become dangerous sooner or later.  At least in my opinon.  And if I'm right then playing this makes perfect sense to me.
907,28,29,2Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4Q3/2N5/PP3PPP/1BRR2K1 w - -',The same thing could also be said with black.  In my opinion this is what black wants but Susan won't allow it as she doesn't exchange.  In this position I would've just for the purposes of liquidation where you exchange pieces while ahead.  But the thing is that GM's have mind of their own and I don't know exactly how they think.  This will change in the next lesson with Susan as I will explore the minds of GM's based on how they think which is something I've been wondering for a while.
908,28,30,2Ne2,b'r2r2k1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4Q3/8/PP2NPPP/1BRR2K1 b - -',I don't know why she played this.
909,28,31,2Rac8,b'2rr2k1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4Q3/8/PP2NPPP/1BRR2K1 w - -',To add a defender to her N.  I know because I've heard of this and whenever you play a move like this where another piece or pawn covers the same square like this you're in reality adding a defender.
910,28,32,2Nf4,b'2rr2k1/1p3ppp/p1n1b2q/4P3/4QN2/8/PP3PPP/1BRR2K1 b - -',Putting pressure on the LSB.
911,28,33,2Bg4,b'2rr2k1/1p3ppp/p1n4q/4P3/4QNb1/8/PP3PPP/1BRR2K1 w - -',Not surprisingly black won't allow it as liquidating isn't an option.  And she makes an attack of her own against one of the R's.  This is also typical for what I've personally seen in GM games.  That when the player attacks the opponent reattacks.  In addition this was mentioned in variations that I've played through.
912,28,34,2Rd6,b'2rr2k1/1p3ppp/p1nR3q/4P3/4QNb1/8/PP3PPP/1BR3K1 b - -',Also typical for the reason mentioned above.
913,28,35,2f6,b'2rr2k1/1p4pp/p1nR1p1q/4P3/4QNb1/8/PP3PPP/1BR3K1 w - -',Wants to exchange pawns.
914,28,36,2Qd5+,b'2rr2k1/1p4pp/p1nR1p1q/3QP3/5Nb1/8/PP3PPP/1BR3K1 b - -',But white has ideas of her own.
915,28,37,2Rcxc6,b'2rr1k2/1p4pp/p1RR1p1q/3QP3/5Nb1/8/PP3PPP/1B4K1 b - -',Now she sacs N for R.  One could view it as a blunder but when it's a GM it's anything but a mistake.  GM's like to make those combinations and sac material as it often wins.  That is either by mate but more often is that they compensate and when they do it's the opponent that winds up losing material instead.
916,28,38,Ke8,b'2r1k3/1p4pp/p1RQ1p1q/4P3/5Nb1/8/PP3PPP/1B4K1 w - -',And it's almost what I mentioned.  But when I talked about losing more material I meant that the opponent winds up further behind.  That however does not happen here.  But there is so much liquidation and black is just as far behind that when all is said and done black will virtually have nothing left.  Therefore with what's about to happen it's safe to conclude that white has a won position at this point.
917,28,39,2Ne2,b'2b1k3/1p4pp/p2Q1p1q/4P3/8/8/PP2NPPP/1B4K1 b - -',"Yep and black resigns here.  Personally I would not have but what I know is that players like me should not give up hope because there might be a second chance if the opponent doesn't find the right move.  That's why the idea is ""Don't give up right away.""  Which was kind of that same idea as to what I noted in my last annotation.  But the really strong players however will often resign after being a piece down as there's generally no chance of compensation since they're up against the strongest players such as this opponent. "
918,29,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',She considered and almost played 2...Nf6 which I'm not sure what it'd be called.  I think it would be the Two Knights Defense or the Berlin Wall.  But I wasn't going to say anything on what's better because they're both common moves and they develop.  However she decided to play this.  I explained to her that this is the Philidor Defense.  She was already impressed that I knew the name of openings and said I'm pretty smart.  I told her that I know the name because I've played against this and the first time I played against this was with the first person I trained.  And it was then explained that this is that Defense.
919,29,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',The most common response.
920,29,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Not a mistake but a small inaccuracy.  I understand why she played this though.  The idea is to develop.  But best was 3...Be7  The idea being is that it doesn't lose a pawn yet.  But now if she plays it right after 4.dxe5 black will lose the opportunity to castle.  Of course I wasn't going to say anything here because Jack and ION have both told me that the loss of castling is a minor issue since all you must do is get the K out push the R to the other side and then put the K back to where it was.  Then it is as though you've castled.  The only issue is the loss of tempii which in this case can be easily compensated for.
921,29,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pP3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?? This is her first blunder which I should've caught.  I thought I won a pawn.  I actually told her that this is an inaccuracy because you allow me to undouble my pawns when I take back.  The idea is not to allow that.  
922,29,4,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3PP3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',But the reality is that 5.exd6! was best as it wins a piece for a pawn.  And that N doesn't have a chance to become dangerous.  By playing this the N becomes powerful and I will wind up with problems.  But this is important as now I have something to learn.  What led to this blunder?  The reality is that there were sudden changes not just because Jack's not there as that wouldn't lose but when notating I had my folder on top of the paper.  And I was trying to find a spot to place my folder.  Now after this I put it on a chair but Ted walked in and he needed it.  So I was suddenly put on the spot.  The reason this is important is that while I passed the Double Bishop mate test with like the highest grade like this game I was distracted by a sudden change so I lost tempii.  But this is worse as it is a real game where I'm training someone and missed the opportunity to get a piece.  Therefore the question then becomes how do you deal with the sudden changes?  The answer is that you pretend it never happened and that things are still normal even when they aren't.  And if you do that you've remained it's like nothing happened and that way it doesn't affect you.
923,29,5,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3nP3/2B5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So now I develop and start coming up with a plan because as I learned with GM Susan Polgar the idea is strengthening your position.  One way you do this is as long as it's not unsound you get aggressive and in this case I want to castle.  But something is bound to happen.
924,29,6,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/3nP3/1bB5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"In it she says ""This was just for fun.  But now I end up in trouble if you find the right move.""  So I said something which Jack implied when he said ""No problem.""  My response was this is not bad at all.  You can easily get out of this and she agreed.  In fact how I got this idea was from Jack where he says ""Don't get nervous."""
925,29,7,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/3nP3/1bB5/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',But she figured that I'd get out this way.  I other words Mary anticipated this move.
926,29,8,a5,b'rnbqk2r/1pp2ppp/8/p2nP3/1bB5/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq a6',"?! The idea of course is to protect the B but it is already protected.  So with that better was to castle right then and there or to play 7...Nc6  Another way of saying is how he who must not be named would've said.  Better was 7...0-0 better was 7...Nc6  This however is an inaccuracy as I point out.  Now she said ""Jack dosen't like it when you move two spaces like this.""   So I blend it in with what he'd say then.  But I also added as this is important.  I said that this loses tempii because it doesn't develop.  And the time is needed to develop castle and control the center."
927,29,9,Bxb4,b'rnbqk2r/1pp2ppp/8/p2nP3/1BB5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',"So I start capitalizing on my advantages by liquidating while up a pawn.  I also thought that I'd waste so that she'd take back with the a pawn.  She finds a better move but nontheless will lose the opportunity to castle with my next move.  With that I will take advantage of my opportunity to castle right then and there before it's too late.  The idea as Susan also puts it is ""Capitalizing your opportunities.""  In addition which I almost overlooked when it comes to something like this as I learned from a mentor early Q exchanges are beneficial.  The idea being is that I now have a lead in development."
928,29,10,1O-O,b'rnbk3r/1pp2ppp/8/p3P3/1nB5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',But this is not the best move because of what she's about to do.  Best was 10.Bb3 protecting the c pawn and R whilst eyeing the f7 square.
929,29,11,1Nxc2,b'rnbk3r/1pp2ppp/8/p3P3/2B5/5N2/PPn2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',At first I did but in reality even though it appears so my last move was not an outright blunder.  For a while I thought my R was a goner until find my next move.
930,29,12,1Ng5,b'rnbk3r/1pp2ppp/8/p3P1N1/2B5/8/PPn2PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',"!! Like last time I nearly overlooked this which is why I thought I was going to lose the R without compensation.  But this move bails me out of trouble.  When I played this Mary said ""You have evil intentions.  You are cruel.""  So I said as per what Jack has also told me you have to find a way out."
931,29,13,1Nxa1,b'rnbk3r/1pp2ppp/8/p3P1N1/2B5/8/PP3PPP/nN3RK1 w - -',"Right after this she said ""At least I have a R in return.""  But the reality is that they wind up exchanged."
932,29,14,1Nxh8,b'rnb4N/1pp1k1pp/8/p3P3/2B5/8/PP3PPP/nN3RK1 b - -',"She said ""I've got nothing left.""  So I responded by saying you're only down a pawn.  In part that was the truth but I was also giving her the same advice that Jack gave me about not getting nervous.  That's because I'm actually implying that it's not as bad as it might appear."
933,29,15,1Be6,b'rn5N/1pp1k1pp/4b3/p3P3/2B5/8/PP3PPP/nN3RK1 w - -',So she develops.  The only problem however is that it allows me to liquidate while being up a pawn.  That's for the most part the problem.  But with just a pawn one could compensate if the opponent made mistakes.  I won't though because the idea is that you don't let your student get the advantage right back.  Instead they have to learn from their mistakes as what I learned when I first started training players.
934,29,16,1Re1,b'rn5N/1pp3pp/4k3/p3P3/8/8/PP3PPP/nN2R1K1 b - -',Now the idea is protecting my passed pawn and the way to do so is putting a R behind it.  It is passed since there are no pawns right in front or to the side of that said pawn.  And this happens to be an important since it's right in the center.
935,29,17,1Nc6,b'r6N/1pp3pp/2n1k3/p3P3/8/8/PP3PPP/nN2R1K1 w - -',She completes development put's more pressure on my passed pawn and is threatening to win piece.  So I have to make some difficult choices.
936,29,18,1Nc3,b'r6N/1pp3pp/2n1k3/p3P3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/n3R1K1 b - -',But after some careful considerations seeing what she's really up to I realize that the most important job is to prevent her from getting a free piece even if it means losing my passer.
937,29,19,1Rxh8,b'7r/1pp3pp/2n1k3/p3P3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/n3R1K1 w - -',So I take.
938,29,20,1Rxa1,b'7r/1pp3pp/2n1k3/p3P3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',"She says ""Oh crumb"" so I said it's still an even exchange.  It's my way of implying ""Don't get nervous.""  Of course it is not even because she equalizes which is also why 15...Nc6 was a good move.  And that is the other reason I implied that."
939,29,21,1Re1,b'7r/1pp3pp/4k3/p3n3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/4R1K1 b - -',The only thing is that equalizing means that I get to pin her N.  And this pin is quite nasty as we're about to see.
940,29,22,1Rd8,b'3r4/1pp3pp/4k3/p3n3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/4R1K1 w - -',?? This is a blunder as I point out.  In it I said that best was 18...g5 to protect the N because of what I'm about to do.  The idea being is that if I then played 19.f4 we exchange the pawns but she doesn't lose a piece as is about to happen. 
941,29,23,1f4,b'3r4/1pp3pp/4k3/p3n3/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/4R1K1 b - f3',"So she said ""Yeah I see terrible.  You've got a good position.""  So I said that the idea is trying to get a better position which I learned as noted from GM Susan Polgar and applied it for this game to coach her."
942,29,24,1Kf5,b'3r4/1pp3pp/8/p3nk2/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/4R1K1 w - -',The idea was to attack my pawn in return.
943,29,25,2Rxe5+,b'3r4/1pp3pp/8/p3Rk2/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',I had a hard time deciding on whether to take my with my f pawn of R.  I decided to take this way with the idea being that once she captures my f pawn I'll liquidate by taking on a5 and that way I remain a piece up.  However better was 20.fxe5  That way it would promote once and for all and I'd win something much more valuable.  It would be a R for a pawn because my R stays behind the pawn.  So once I promote or even if I didn't once she took on the e file I'd grab her remaining R.  
944,29,26,g5,b'3r4/1pp4p/8/R5p1/5k2/2N5/PP4PP/6K1 w - g6',? I believe that the idea was to add a defender to the K.  However and I forgot to point this out.  The move played is a mistake.  21...Rd5?? is the worst as that loses the R.  And why I say that is the idea on how to protect.  Therefore best was 21...c6 to protect that pawn.  That's because the N can and will fork since she will be in check and she cannot take with 21...Rxd5?? due to my R on the same rank.  So once I check black will lose another pawn. 
945,29,27,2Nb5+,b'3r4/1p5p/3k4/RN4p1/8/8/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',"Now I run back.  The idea is once again ""Capitalizing my advantages.  I'm coming up with a plan for the endgame and it's similar to the Double Bishop and the N+B mate using those same strategies.  For those that were in the Chess Warriors team and took the test that strategy is the same which I posted in the KOH club about the endgames."
946,29,28,2Ra7,b'3r4/Rp2k2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',The idea here is to pin her b pawn.  No I'm not trying to win anything else yet but the idea is to put more pressure on the b file.
947,29,29,2Rd1+,b'8/Rp2k2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP4PP/3r2K1 w - -',Of course she gets out of it but as noted I'm coming up with endgame techniques as noted earlier with that link which are very similar to what I took in the quizzes that some know about and it's how you use some of those difficult ones for standard endgames as this is.
948,29,30,2Kf2,b'8/Rp2k2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP3KPP/3r4 b - -',It starts here.  So what do we need to keep in mind.  In an endgame the K is a powerful weapon.  In fact I'd say that it's about as powerful as the R.  Now in this case my goal is to try and centralize my monarch which means that I want it in the center and as close as possible to her K.  
949,29,31,2Rd2+,b'8/Rp2k2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP1r1KPP/8 w - -',I thought the idea was to win a pawn but that isn't so as I'd take back on b7 so it would be exchanged.  So her real aim is to simply put pressure on my monarch.
950,29,32,2Ke1,b'8/Rp2k2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP1r2PP/4K3 b - -',"So I get out by getting ""The Opposition"" which is also very important in an endgame as we learned about.  That's something that Jack also once emphasizes that when you have the advantage acheiving the opposition is very important.  However best was 27.Ke3 because not only do I still get the opposition but at the same time I'm centralizing my monarch much more since it's closer to her K.  With this move however it's further away which is something you generally don't want because when closer there's more pressure on the opponents K so that it has less room to maneuver."
951,29,33,2Rd7,b'8/Rp1rk2p/8/1N4p1/8/8/PP4PP/4K3 w - -',Adding a defender to her b pawn.
952,29,34,2Ra3,b'8/1p1rk2p/8/1N4p1/8/R7/PP4PP/4K3 b - -',However I decide to try and put a different pressure on her K.  In reality what I'm doing is applying the same technique to what I used against chicoboy.  And that's the only game where I had a very similar position to the N+B and K endgame against the lonely K where you figure out how to mate.  The only difference being is that I used my R and was able to beat him but I kept in mind that if his K moved the wrong way it would be mate.  And that would be very similar to the N+B mate except that you've used your R which is why I believe that in the endgame the K is as powerful as the R as they do more or less the same thing during that phase.
953,29,35,2Kd8,b'3k4/1p1r3p/8/1N4p1/8/R7/PP4PP/4K3 w - -',? I think she was worried about a check on e8 which I was also planning to do.  But as I tell her later on this was a mistake because it loses a pawn.  Therefore best was 28...h5  I now realize after looking at it that just as good was 28...h6  I forgot to tell her but had she played that and I responded now with 29.Rh3 she could protect that pawn with 29...Rh7  
954,29,36,2Rh3,b'3k4/1p1r3p/8/1N4p1/8/7R/PP4PP/4K3 b - -',"With that mistake which I tell her.  But just before that she said ""That's terrible""  So then I said just before what she should've played was that the only problem is the loss of a pawn.  Of course I know it's far worse then that as she's down a piece and a pawn but I wasn't going to tell her just how bad it was as Mary would get more nervous and therefore make more mistakes.  So the idea is don't overcoach and keep her calm.  That way her concentration is better and she doesn't make more mistakes.  And the idea is keeping things positives so that the student doesn't resign either as that's something I thought might happen as the idea is ""Fight til the end.""  By doing so you learn more. "
955,29,37,2Re7+,b'3k4/1p2r2p/8/1N4p1/8/7R/PP4PP/4K3 w - -',Although it seems odd this is what I wanted her to do as Mary will check to attack and gain a little confidence.  And even though I won't mistakes I want her to be calm and confident for learning purposes.  The idea is that by believing in yourself you can make it through a difficult time as I told reachforgoals during my first mentoring session with her.
956,29,38,3Kd2,b'3k4/1p2r2p/8/1N4p1/8/7R/PP1K2PP/8 b - -',But her last move now allows me to maintain the opposition and bring me one step closer to centralizing my K.
957,29,39,3Re5,b'3k4/1p5p/8/1N2r1p1/8/7R/PP1K2PP/8 w - -',Maintaining confidence by going after my N.
958,29,40,3Nc3,b'3k4/1p5p/8/4r1p1/8/2N4R/PP1K2PP/8 b - -',Now I almost made a blunder here and came close to playing 31.Nd6??  The problem is that Mary would compensate with a skewer after 31...Rd5 which is something I can't allow.  The idea being is that one shouldn't allow their student to compensate as you make it too easy.  Instead they have to learn from their mistakes so the only way is that you don't allow compensation and the way to do that is not make mistakes like that.
959,29,41,3Re6,b'3k4/1p5p/4r3/6p1/8/2N4R/PP1K2PP/8 w - -',"She said ""Have nothing left no good moves.""  So now I said it's not over yet.  In other words I'm implying that resignation is still premature because I believe Mary was implying resignation and the idea is what I noted that ""it's not over until it's over."""
960,29,42,3Rxh7,b'3k4/1p5R/4r3/6p1/8/2N5/PP1K2PP/8 b - -',Meanwhile I waist no time in grabbing that pawn that I noted.
961,29,43,3Rd6+,b'3k4/1p5R/3r4/6p1/8/2N5/PP1K2PP/8 w - -',"At first I thought that she was only doing this to get aggressive because of her position.  But in reality her goal was to pull a swindle and get a draw by rep.  So I must be very careful and believe it or not it almost worked.  Not to mention that I waisted time.  But the reason it didn't is because I remembered what happened in the B+N mate quiz.  And the idea is that you're supposed to be able to deliver check mate.  If you draw in any shape or form then you fail.  While most failed due to 50 move rule since there would be no captures and they couldn't check mate in 50 moves I failed because the N moved too much so the game ended in a draw by rep.  Well if I didn't play 35.Kc2 I'm pretty sure that the same thing would've happened.  And since I have a winning advantage and it's against a student so more then just ""the real deal"" allowing a draw would be terrible.  You can't just let your student off with a draw.  Instead if you're winning you must keep that advantage because if you don't the student won't learn as much.  And the idea is helping him or her learn from their mistakes in order to help them build develop and improve their games.  At least I saw what was going on in time and inhibited that chance of a draw by preventing another check."
962,29,44,Rf6,b'3k4/1p5R/5r2/6p1/8/2N5/PPK3PP/8 w - -',The idea is to be able to win a pawn with a fork.
963,29,45,3Rxb7,b'3k4/1R6/5r2/6p1/8/2N5/PPK3PP/8 b - -',And I allow it because when she takes this becomes an exchange as opposed to winning a pawn.  In addition I once again get the opposition and become one step closer to centralizing my K once I get out of check.
964,29,46,3b4,b'3k4/1R6/8/6p1/1P6/2NK4/P5rP/8 b - b3',No matter what I would've played my h pawn is gone.  But that is ok because I have two pawns that are better since they're passers.  With that being said I come up with other ideas and that's maintaining a pawn chain because as I learned not too long ago in endgames one thing that is essential is a pawn chain with passed pawns as it helps you promote.  I couldn't find the best examples and had made some mistakes as a couple of commentators in those annotations pointed.  But this game is the perfect example of what I was alluding as a similar example was shown I forgot exactly by who but it was either an IM or GM and his video was very good and instructive that I was able to apply it here.
965,29,47,3a4,b'3k4/1R6/8/6p1/PP6/2NK4/7r/8 b - a3',I also could've played 39.a3 with a pawn chain once and for all.  But the idea behind the chains is to protect one of the pawns.  But in this position I kept in mind that even if here the a pawn is just as much defended by my N.
966,29,48,3Rh3+,b'3k4/1R6/8/6p1/PP6/2NK3r/8/8 w - -',As expected.
967,29,49,4Kd4,b'3k4/1R6/8/6p1/PP1K4/2N4r/8/8 b - -',Maintaining the opposition in the process.  Now the only other way to keep my N safe was with 40.Kd2  But the reason I played this is because I'm one step closer to centralizing my K.  The idea there is that the opponents K is confined so now there is one less square that Mary has available for her K.  
968,29,50,4g4,b'3k4/1R6/8/8/PP1K2p1/2N4r/8/8 w - -',Now she has a passed pawn which I will not chance.
969,29,51,4Ke4,b'3k4/1R6/8/8/PP2K1p1/2N4r/8/8 b - -',So while I did mention centralizing your K that wasn't the idea here and forget the opposition.  With any other move it's likely that black would get her advantage and possibly win this game.  How do I know this?  A very similar position happened with amnita and it was just like this except that I did not have a pawn chains and the R's were not present.  But I just kept advancing pawns and by doing so she was able to promote.  Consequently not only did I lose my advantage but she got the edge and was able to pull a swindle because Amnita won what was a hopelessly lost game as some know about from that annotation.  Well I couldn't allow that.  And knowing that her pawn was closer to the promotion square then my pawns I just couldn't chance this one.
970,29,52,4g3,b'3k4/1R6/8/8/PP2K3/2N3pr/8/8 w - -',And she attempts to promote.
971,29,53,4Kf3,b'3k4/1R6/8/8/PP6/2N2Kpr/8/8 b - -',But I now stop it cold.  And she dare not discover check me with 42...g2+ as I'd win that remaining pawn with 43.Kxg2
972,29,54,4Kc8,b'2k5/1R6/8/8/PP6/2N2Kpr/8/8 w - -',To put pressure on my R.
973,29,55,4Rg7,b'2k5/6R1/8/8/PP6/2N2Kpr/8/8 b - -',But no matter how you look at it this is what I would've played regardless as now black must lose her pawn no matter what she plays.
974,29,56,Rh4,b'3k4/8/8/8/PP5r/2N2KR1/8/8 w - -',"She said ""I have no pawns left.""  So I said yes and I knew how dangerous the passed pawn was and couldn't underestimate.  The idea being of course what Jack said which I also said in that annotation with my mistake against anitam.  That is ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning position be very careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and losing the game.""  This especially applies here since as noted I was her trainer here and therefore could not allow Mary to get her advantage back for learning purposes.  That's also because as easy19 puts it ""Games that you win are bad for learning purposes.""  Now what he's alluding to is the person that's being trained and I strongly with his assessment for the reasons outlined earlier in part because this is what Jack has implied.  And that's why when I'm with him he'd rather play with me then have me play with Mary.  That way I also learn."
975,29,57,4b5,b'3k4/8/8/1P6/P6r/2N2KR1/8/8 b - -',Now I get achieve that pawn chain.  And part of it is that you advance one pawn at a time so that they're directly diagonal from each as they are here.  This way the opponent can't stop both passed pawns.  And usually as is with this position none of the passers are stoppable.  There will be rare occasions where you'd be able to stop one but can't do so for the other which is actually the idea behind it but usually none can be stopped which is even better.
976,29,58,4Rh5,b'3k4/8/8/1P5r/P7/2N2KR1/8/8 w - -',The idea which has occasionally worked is to stop one of the passed pawns.  However the N does and will prevent her from being able to do so. 
977,29,59,4Rg8+,b'3k2R1/8/8/1P5r/P7/2N2K2/8/8 b - -',I could've played 46.a5 but she might be able to refute this with 46...Ra7 and even if 47.a6 she can now play 47...Ra8 preventing those pawns from promoting.  Well I wasn't going to allow that so now the idea is forcing the K onto the 7th rank and that way things stay the same.  Except that I will be able to promote a pawn. 
978,29,60,4a5,b'6R1/4k3/8/PP5r/8/2N2K2/8/8 b - -',Having said that I now continue the advancement.
979,29,61,4Rh3+,b'6R1/4k3/8/PP6/8/2N2K1r/8/8 w - -',Now she checks just for thrills and giggles.  The idea being to maintain confidence and for as long as possible in this situation.  This makes me impressed that Mary followed my advice by remaining calm in the worst of situations.  And it also shows that she is improving her games.
980,29,62,4Rg3,b'8/4k3/8/PP6/8/2N2KRr/8/8 b - -',However instead of moving back I will prevent any more checks as that cost white time and the idea as I learned in the Double Bishop Mate as noted much earlier where I waisted time is that when you have a winning advantage you don't want to waist tempo.  Instead you want to get the job done.  Plus if I got out with my K she could continue checking me.  And if this happened the game could eventually end in a draw by rep.  Well as noted with a student I won't make a mistake that will allow him or her draw in a won position as the idea is helping the student learn from the mistakes. 
981,29,63,4Rh8,b'7r/4k3/8/PP6/8/2N2KR1/8/8 w - -',"She said ""Darn"" and I understand why.  This time I forgot what I said and it is worth noting that I only made two mistakes in the notation.  However I when it comes to remembering what I said I have a near pictogram memory.  That means that I can remember exactly what is said real said but not right after being said which would be pictogram but once it gets stored from working into long term memory which is a general weakness.  Once I remember however I won't forget and I remembered one of them very quickly.  This one however I didn't.   But what I think I said was something like don't give up hope yet.  Of course the idea being is that if I was to make a mistake there's still a chance that she'd be able to compensate.  So I still did not her to resign yet because she wouldn't learn as much.  And I'm not at all surprised with this move because with just a R there's no way that she would allow me to liquidate as noted since that would leave Mary with just her K.  I anticipated that as well which is another reason for playing with the idea being that now I gain time promote.  And at the very least that kind of thing will happen.   "
982,29,64,4b6,b'7r/4k3/1P6/P7/8/2N2KR1/8/8 b - -',So I continue advancing and maintain my pawn chain.
983,29,65,4Rf8+,b'5r2/4k3/1P6/P7/8/2N2KR1/8/8 w - -',And Mary does follow my earlier advice with this move as she's doing what she can to stay in.  This will help for a move or two.  Worth noting is that when I was in this situation got nervous and followed Jack's advice which I gave I'd do so by placing my opponent in check as I do so.
984,29,66,5Ke4,b'5r2/4k3/1P6/P7/4K3/2N3R1/8/8 b - -',But getting out means that I prevent another check and therefore prevent further loss of tempo by once again maintaining the opposition.  And this is another reason that the opposition is essential during the endgame.
985,29,67,5Ra8,b'r7/4k3/1P6/P7/4K3/2N3R1/8/8 w - -',Doing whatever she can to stay in and aiming for my a5 pawn.  If Mary finds the right move she'll be to capture it and therefore stop one of my passers.
986,29,68,5b7,b'r7/1P2k3/8/P7/4K3/2N3R1/8/8 b - -',Keeping that in mind however instead of continuing like a normally would with 51.a6 with the idea being of course the pawn chain I play this.  The reason is that even if she takes I promote instantly.  And if black defends with 51...Rb8 I will play then continue that pawn chain with the immediate 52.a6 so that no matter what she does one pawn will promote.  And that variation that I provided with 51...Rb8 52.a6 is the main reason why a pawn chain is vital.  The idea being is that it will generally enable one to Q.
987,29,69,5Kd7,b'r7/1P1k4/8/P7/4K3/2N3R1/8/8 w - -',"?? As I told her this is an outright blunder.  Best was 51...Rxa5 getting a pawn in return.  But what I forgot to say was what someone once told me which was ""Almost any move was better then this.""  The reason being is because of what I'm about to play.  Now Mary took a quick break but right after coming back she forgot that I had played 51.b7  However even for me the position is resignable. "
988,29,70,5bxa8=Q,b'Q7/3k4/8/P7/4K3/2N3R1/8/8 b - -',"At this point seeing that black is only left the K as opposed to what I have she resigned.  This time as I agree because of what I said a move earlier that at this point resignation is no longer premature.  I would feel differently if I only had a Q+K in this position with her lonely K as then there would be a chance for Mary to get a draw.  That's because if I played things wrong the game would end in a stalemate.  But with this much material from white there's no way that it could happen because no matter how you look at it sooner or later a checkmate becomes inevitable.  In the end I told Mary that she played extremely well in this game.  And this is where Mary implied that I was a very good trainer by thanking me for taking the time coach her with a smile. And I agree with Jack in the fact that she's really improving as I've noticed this myself.  She only made two or three mistakes as I told her though in reality I miscounted one but that was enough to lose the game.  So the morals of this game are first ""don't give things away"" as Jack puts it because doing so could mean disaster as things go downhill after as I also remember from my game against elyhim where I blundered a pawn and lost.  And as Dan Hesiman puts it ""It only takes one bad move to lose a game. So be careful on every move.""  That applies here because after Mary blundered her N not too long after things went downhill.  In addition I learned something which I also mentioned earlier.  In chess and life there are sudden changes.  And when this happens you have to pretend that it didn't happen and things are normal.  By doing so you play as you normally and therefore don't overlook or calculate anything.  With this being I thank Jack Stockel for being the coach that he is setting a good example for others and bringing in the chess boards regardless.  That is because without it this game would not have been possible."

Maybe he was trying to figure out what the specifics of the e6 Sicilians are as they're played less often. In contrast I play rather quickly trying to gain a small time edge while I still can as I knew my opponent is a long thinker.

That being said the dark squares of Black's position are usually very weak and in the e6 Sicilians a common theme for White is to take advantage of that. I can't say that this move accomplishes this. He doesn't have to be afraid of Nxd4 either since it was protected by his queen. Nc3 would have been played had we followed the main lines.
1110,33,2,Qc7,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Slightly confusing my opponent. This particular opening is called the Taimanov variation of the Sicilian defense and sadly not a lot of Sicilian players play it as they tend to favor either d6 variations of the Sicilian or play the Khan Sicilian. The Taimanov and the Khan share very similar ideas but the queen on c7 can sometimes become a weakness rather then an asset after Nb5. It's pointless to play this now as after 6. Nb5 Qb8 7. Nc3 a6 8. Nd4 black is fine and it can even be said to be a better position. The queen on c7 controls the b8-h2 diagonal and indirectly glares at the c-pawn on c2. Often the queen comes in handy for a minority attack on the queenside or we use both the a8-h1 diagonal and the b8-h2 diagonal to exert enormous pressure on his castled king. Of course if you've never played against the Taimanov then this is tricky to understand without losing too much time.

Granted after the main line Qd2 there are some theoretical lines with Bb4 but if you know the theory by head then you realise that White can come out fine. That being said Bb4 which I was planning in the near future isn't an option anymore.

Black can win a pawn with 9. Nxb4 10. axb4 Qxc3+ which is fairly obvious and there's little that White can do about it. That being said it isn't as simple as it appears since after 9. Nxb4 White has the fascinating response of Nxb5! doing the exact same thing. It took me a long time to calculate whether or not Nxb5 works but found that after 9. b4 Nxb4 10. Nxb5 axb5 11. Nxb5 you have the cheeky Nxc2+. Taking it with the queen means that 12. Qxc2 Qxc2 follows with a very easy game for Black. Therefore the only option for White is to move the king. If 12. Kf1 then you meet that with 12. Nxe3+ 13. fxe3 and without the dark squares bishop you can play Qb6 escaping the Nb5 threat. If the king goes to d2 then you have 12. Qa5+. 13. Kxc2 Rc2+ and with the pawn on e4 also falling in the future with Bxe4 it seems grim. Checkmate seems inevitable. It seems rather easy when you have an analysis board next to you but calculating everything OTB was surprisingly difficult. After running everything through my head a few more times I decided to go on with my plan although I felt like something wasn't entirely right.

White's plan for here is rather obvious and I start to think on ways to counter it. White would like to play Rfd1 and target my d7-pawn. Sadly that's not possible yet as I have 2 defenders on it ( queen and king ). That being said White has definite ideas of Nxb5 after Rfd1 winning him back the pawn at the very least and even cramping my position.

White wants to get his rook on the open-file and move his knight away. He moves to f3 with the idea of maybe pushing e5 in in the future or occupying this square with his knight.
1123,33,15,1Ne7,b'r3kb1r/1bqpnppp/p3pn2/1p6/4P3/P1N1BN2/2PQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',I wanted to win the e-pawn and quickly secure my win. You can draw an endgame with 1 pawn down but with 2? The plan is easy. Play Nxe4 win the pawn trade all my pieces off and go into an easy endgame. I'm not too scared of e5 either since I can always just play Nfd5 getting a really strong knight in the center.

I opt for a5 as I start growing suspicious of a future Nxb5  which feels rather strong. Nxb5 axb5 Bxb5 and Black's position can't possibly get more cramped. Qa5 stops Nxb5 ideas because of axb5 and now both queens are looking directly at each other and it's in Black's best interest to remove White's queen as it's a powerful attacker in this position. All that being said I can't help but feel like this is a mistake but find it hard to suggest an alternative.

That being said I'm fine with doubled pawns. Black's position will never allow the rook and bishop to get into play so an additional open file can potentially give them activity again. I think ( haven't looked into it yet but I have a feeling ) that White could have played Nxb5 here instead. 15. Nxb5 Qxd2 16. Nc7+ Kd7 17. Rxd2. White will line up both his rooks and the knight on c7 is troublesome. Additionally the White bishop will enter the attack as soon as I move my rook with Bxa6. This position seems very scary.

I'm pretty sure he didn't notice Nxb5 and it might not have been an issue anymore now that the bishop is on g5 but it still seemed like Nxb5 would be possible in the future so I opted for this. Now I can respond with axb5 to Nxb5 without having the fear of losing my queen.

At this point I don't really care anymore being satisfied with my draw. I'm pretty sure there were a lot of inaccuracies in this game but given the many threats White had I think this result is fair. With this I'm currently 1.5/4 which isn't bad considering 90% of all players competing are higher rated then myself but there's still 5 matches to play.

1180,35,0,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Not what I was expecting from my opponent but I was secretly glad. I knew that my opponent had played a delayed alapin ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 )and the grand prix attack ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 )  back in 2013 and thus had prepared a lot for those openings. Some lines I had looked at went all the way up to 11 moves or so. A direct alapin isn't what I prepared for but I do have a friend who plays the alapin and thus I knew some theory of it. At this point I had no idea what was in store for me.
1181,35,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is as far as I know how the theory goes. Here my friend would usually just play Bc4 which I'd meet with Nb6 after which he retreats his bishop to b3. Bc4 is not the main line but it's interesting in its own rights although I think that black equalises a tad too easily in that variation. Nc3 isn't the main line for as far as I know as I believe Nf3 is more often played in which both sides have their chances. Here I was a little clueless as to how to handle the situation.
1182,35,2,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I decide to play Nb6 rather then trade with Nxc3 which is probably a mistake. I was a little frightened of the pawn chain that follows since the plan of 6. Nxc3 7. bxc3 d6 immediately targeting that very pawn chain doesn't really work because of Maybe 8. exd6 Qxd6 9. Qxd6 exd6 that follows. d6 isn't a requirement but it's one of the moves I'm used to when it comes to breaking the alapin pawnchain. I'm wasn't sure how to resolve that position and thus opted for Nb6. This is the last time these knights will get action in this game.
1183,35,3,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',Too aggressive in my opinion but I didn't manage to punish him for it so I'm not sure if I can even criticize this move. It's clear that White is coming for Black's head.
1184,35,4,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',I looked at all kinds of moves here but opted for d5. e6 is great and all but my dark squared bishop will be rather weak due to his pawns being on the dark squares and if I ever want to play f6 then I might want to keep the e-pawn there. d6 was also an option with the intention of taking his pawn on e5 but it feels rather pointless after he recaptures fxe5. The logic behind d5 is essentially to develop my light squared bishop play e6 and close the position. Not the most ambitious plan but I said beforehand that I would be satisfied with a draw today against a much stronger opponent. Maybe that attitude is exactly what cost me the game. In chess it's often far better to be overconfident as your play gets more ambitious. Today I learned that you should never go into a game with the thought that a draw is fine.
1185,35,5,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3pP3/3P1Pb1/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Bg4 felt stronger then Bf5. if Bf5 was played then I had some concerns regarding Bd3 which could follow. Looking back to it I should have been content with trading off our strong pieces.
1186,35,6,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3pP3/3P1Pb1/2N1BN2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Defending the d4 square so that he can recapture with his queen were Bxf3 to be played. This bishop looks bad but f5 is bound to be played sooner or later and it'll get new opportunities there.

1188,35,8,1h3,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/3pP3/3P1Pb1/2N1BN1P/PP4P1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',He doesn't like my bishop so h3 is logical. I start thinking about 10. h3 Bh5 11. g4 Bg6 and realised I didn't like that position at all. White has so much space and it seems inevitable that he'll come crashing through in that position. Afterwards he told me he would never have played g4 since it seriously weakens his king safety but I'm pretty convinced that he could get away with it.
1189,35,9,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/pnn1p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N1BQ1P/PP4P1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I noticed that his light squared bishop still isn't developed and would rather not have it pester my knight. This move doesn't exactly do much aside from keeping the knight and bishop away from b5.
1190,35,10,1a3,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/pnn1p3/3pP3/3P1P2/P1N1BQ1P/1P4P1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',My opponent decided that my plan of a6 isn't completely horrible and with this move tries to keep my dark squared bishop out of the game.
1191,35,11,1Be7,b'r2qk2r/1p2bppp/pnn1p3/3pP3/3P1P2/P1N1BQ1P/1P4P1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Probably a grave mistake looking back on it. It doesn't seem like a mistake at first but I think it's clear that all the action will happen on the kingside. Better would probably have been Ne7 preparing for the knight to either get to g6 of f5 and then after that play Be7. The problem with Be7 is that my knights now have no way of helping in the onslaught that is about to happen. White will play things like Bd3 castle kingside f5 and there's just too much pieces of him attacking that side of the board to hold. The logic behind Be7 was simple.  My bishop has to go to e7 or it will never develop. The logic is sound but there were bigger priorities in the position. Even on just move 12 a mistake like this can easily be made it's why I always try and play incredibly slow as to not overlook the dangers in a position and alter my play accordingly. Sadly I missed it entirely this time around.
1192,35,12,g6,b'r2qk2r/1p2bp1p/pnn1p1p1/3pP3/3P1P2/P1NBBQ1P/1P4P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',At this point I had noticed the danger. That being said g6 seriously weakens the positions. Yes it stops f5 but f5 wasn't a big threat at this point yet. Better would probably have been f6 trying to create room for black or f5 after which g6 follows and the position is not too easy to break for White.
1193,35,13,1O-O,b'r2qk2r/1p2bp1p/pnn1p1p1/3pP3/3P1P2/P1NBBQ1P/1P4P1/R4RK1 b kq -',With his 2 pieces on the f-file it's about time to put on some serious pressure.

If I have to take then I can maybe try to castle afterwards and my rook on the f-file could create some issues for white. I was also looking at f5 but underestimated the strength of that move.

Black can obviously win the bishop here but against what price... gxe5 Qxg5. With future threats of Qh5+ Bh8 e6 etc. I couldn't find a way out for Black if I took the bishop. If I play some random move then Bxg6+ follows after which he'll take the pawn on f6 after hxg6 and I might as well resign at that point. fxe5 isn't exactly good either since it has the same idea of Bxg6+

The game was badly played by myself ( I can do much better ) but valuable. I'm not the least bit upset about this loss. If I had won then my next opponent would probably have been a 2000 elo player regardless which probably would have meant my first loss anyway. My next opponent is someone of 1778 elo with over 1800 official matches played. That being said he's already a little older ( 78 years old if I'm not mistaking ) and from as far as I've been able to tell looking at his past games he always replies with the Chigorin indian defense. He either always transposes into it or plays a sideline of it and his 8 moves are more or less the same every single time. ( granted that's based of his games played in 2013 but still. After so many games I expect him to have a stable opening repertoire by now. ) I'll be ready for his opening and this time with the White pieces I'll be hunting for blood. Hopefully it'll be an enjoyable game.

1218,37,0,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So far the opening has been quite easy to play. I was expecting him to play d5 and move into the grunfeld defence at this point. Nf3 is more of a waiting move with the hopes that he plays d5. I was sort of hoping for it since it was one of the few openings that I actually had prepared for that day. However my opponent didn't play with a lot of ambition and just sort of turtled up.
1219,37,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Not the move I was hoping for but a valid move. For as far as I understand the position he'll turtle up and wait for me to go on the offensive and then hope to somewhere gain an edge.
1220,37,2,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ e3',I accept his challenge. I'm not familiar with having this much control over the center but it can't possibly be a bad thing.

1222,37,4,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',This was the first move on which I spent more then 5 minutes surprising my opponent. It may seem like an easy move to make but I had to calculate potential c5 and e5 plans. I figured that I was okay with e5 being played. I'd probably respond with d5 and suddenly his bishop on g7 becomes a lot less valuable. If he played c5 then I was okay with dxc5 since  I could potentially get a stronghold for my knight on d5. Granted that's looking many many moves into the future but still. I was also considering to put my bishop on f4 since it puts a halt to e5 ideas but didn't find a lot of value there. The d6 pawn is rock solid. I also could have put it on e3 but felt that wasn't ambitious enough.
1223,37,5,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The idea is to chase away my bishop but this move weakens his structure considerably and is the start of me slowly building towards a decisive attack.
1224,37,6,Bh4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Retreating the bishop and provoking him to play g5 seriously weakening his position.
1225,37,7,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Creating another diagonal for his queen and supporting an eventual b5 push. He won't play d5 since it doesn't actually accomplish a lot so I was sure that his plan was b5. I wasn't too afraid of it since him trading on c4 could create an interesting home for my light squared bishop.
1226,37,8,a6,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Another prep move for b5. He really seeks counterplay via the queenside of the board. I still wasn't terribly concerned.
1227,37,9,Qd2,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This move took me a surprising long time to make. The idea is very simple but I had to look into the entire b5 affair.The idea is to capture the knight on f6. He loses a pawn if he recaptures with the bishop so he'll recapture with the f-pawn. It creates a nice open e-file for black but his bishop is temporarily rather bad and the doubled pawns don't help a lot in defending his position. The open e-file can also serve as a way to get my own pieces into the attack.

Maybe I should have castled instead inviting b4 so I'd have a reason to play Nd1 -> Ne3 but I felt like there might be better things in the position rather then castling. Let's asses the position for a second. My control over the center is arguably better he got doubled pawns and his pieces are still stuck on the 8th rank. On the other hand he got a nice open e-file and some questionable counterplay on the queenside. f5 is also coming after which the position becomes quite a bit more complicated and sadly all those complications are mine to calculate. I have about 55 minutes left on my clock.
1231,37,13,1f5,b'rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Let the complications start! The difficulty of this position is that if I allow bxc4 or fxe4 I lose material. Let's say I play a hypothetical 12. h3 bxc4 13. Bxc4 fxe4 and I can't recapture with the knight because of d5! forking bishop and knight. At this point I start calculating every possible way of capturing and if I can get away somehow with leaving the position as is. The conclusion I come to is that I can't  ignore it. Now I need to make a decision on whether I capture on b5 or on f5. There's also the issue of Re8 that's coming pinning my bishop and king.
1232,37,14,1cxb5,b'rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp2pp/1P3p2/3PP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This variation seemed the best result for White. Now there are 3 possible moves for black. axb5 which activates his rook but makes his c6 pawn very vulnerable. cxb5 which isn't bad but I could get a pawn on d5 and create a strong square for my knight on c6 or I could maybe get my bishop on f3 push e5. and then threaten to win material. The other option is fxe4 and it's the variation I was most worried about. fxe4 Nxe4 and with Bf5 he gets his bishop active again. That or he could play Re8 and threaten my knight. Either way my response will be the same.
1233,37,15,1axb5,b'rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/1p3p2/3PP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Winning back the pawn but his knight will have issues developing to a good square. and his c6 pawn is rather weak.
1234,37,16,1exf5,b'rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/1p3P2/3P4/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I am okay with him moving his bishop to f5. I have ideas after Bxf5 to play d5. If he trades cxd5 I can capture on b5 first and his doubled pawns in the center will become an easy target.
1235,37,17,1b4,b'rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5P2/1p1P4/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Not the response I was expecting but it's definitely more challenging then the ideas I had in mind. I can't take axb4 since Rxa1 follows. I don't have the time to castle either because of bcx3. I start looking for ideas along the lines of 13. fxg6 bxc3 14. gxf7+ Rxf7 15. Qxc3 but came to the conclusion that his now weakened kingposition wasn't worth the knight on c3. I also had some concerns still about Re8 that can come at any moment but it's then that I noticed that if my knight was on g3 then it'd also defend my bishop on e2 and as a result I don't need to fear Re8 since I'd have enough time to castle out of the pin.
1236,37,18,1Ng3,b'rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5b2/1p1P4/P4NN1/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Defending the bishop on e2 and threatening to create yet another weakness in his position with Nxf5.  At this point in time I had about half an hour left my opponent had 1 hour and 16 minutes left. With the additional 30 minutes still nowhere in sight I became a little bit frightened but I knew my position should be winning.
1237,37,19,1bxa3,b'rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5b2/3P4/p4NN1/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I didn't see it coming and most would have just played bxa3 or Rxa3 in an instant here however I  notice that capturing the pawn on h6 comes with check. I know what I want to play here but still spent quite some time recounting the material over and over again. I may not have a lot of time left but with a 30 second increment per move I won't run out.
1238,37,20,1Nxf5,b'rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5N2/3P4/p4N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Allowing the capture on b2 since I'll have Qxb2. Either he captures my knight and ruins his pawnstructure in the process or he goes through with his plan and I'll still have a superior position due to his pieces being stuck on the 8th rank.
1239,37,21,1Nxh6+,b'rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pN/8/3P4/5N2/1p1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Capturing is more or less forced. Kh8 gets met by Nxf7 winning a pawn in the process and Kh7 gets met by Qxb2. It's the   same position but his king is slightly more vulnerable. Note that Ng5+ after Kh7 looks promising but doesn't lead to much. You can take on f7 and fork if he takes on h6 but with him promoting while winning your rook you'll be down in material. About 20 minutes on my clock left. My opponent gets an arrogant look on his face as if he finds it hard to believe that someone of his strength is drawing/losing to someone of mine. Especially since I'm a slow player. At this point I was a little bit sad since although I was convinced that my position was better I wasn't sure if it was enough to force a win. Interesting to note better was to just take Qxb2 here since he'll have to recapture gxf5 and it ruins his pawn structure completely giving me a decent advantage.
1240,37,22,1Qxb2,b'rn1q1rk1/5p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/1Q2BPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Material is dead even again. Black might do well here to just trade off the rooks and hope he can hold a draw. Computers even suggest that black is up 0.7 after the trade of rooks for reasons that aren't completely clear to me. The position has been around equal for a long time now ( according to computers ) though it definitely didn't feel that way when I was playing. Perhaps because the position feels relatively easy to play for white.
1241,37,23,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/3n1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/1Q2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Finally developing his knight ( I can't say much as I haven't castled yet but still. ) I start thinking about h4 ->h5 ideas but found that while interesting I'd like to castle sometime soon as to not risk losing to some dumb thing I overlooked.
1242,37,24,Qc7,b'r4rk1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/1Q2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I don't fully understand this move. It defends both his pawns and indirectly aims at the h2 square but it doesn't feel that strong.
1243,37,25,2Rfd1,b'r4rk1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/1Q2BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Preparing the d5 push. The plan was easy. Either he captures and I'll get my rook on the 5th rank where I can wreak havoc in the future or he pushes and I put my knight on c6.
1244,37,26,2Rab8,b'1r3rk1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/1Q2BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',A move that feels kind of pointless. You still have an hour left why aren't you thinking of a concrete plan?!? I shout in my mind.
1245,37,27,2Qc2,b'1r3rk1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/2Q1BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',I was thinking of Qa2 since it makes him unable to move his f-pawn but I was pretty sure I couldn't force anything on Qa2. The plan of Qc2 is to eventually get my rook to g3 and do some kind of sacrifice perhaps. Especially since I'd also be able to win his bishop which is adequate compensation imo. Sacrifice on g6 get my queen on g6 his king moves to h8 I capture the bishop he goes back to g8 I play Ng5 and it looks like it'll eventually end up in checkmate. That was the basic idea.
1246,37,28,2Rfe8,b'1r2r1k1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P4/5N2/2Q1BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Threatening the bishop which is defended anyway. Better was probably Nf6.
1247,37,29,2Nh4,b'1r2r1k1/2qn1p2/2pp2pb/8/3P3N/8/2Q1BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Had I played in this tournament half a year ago I wouldn't have found this move. But now I played it with little hesitation. I blame all the puzzles I solved over the course of the year sacrificing all types of pieces. The idea behind Nh4 is to play Nxg6.
1248,37,30,2Nf6,b'1r2r1k1/2q2p2/2pp1npb/8/3P3N/8/2Q1BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',A good defence. Now Nxg6 fxg6 Qxg6 gets met with Qg7!. The only way to progress is to keep on adding pressure until he cracks.
1249,37,31,2Ra3,b'1r2r1k1/2q2p2/2pp1npb/8/3P3N/R7/2Q1BPPP/3R2K1 b - -',Preparing Rf3 or Rg3. I wasn't 100% sure of this yet but my opponent finally started to realise he had an hour left on his clock and started to think. I'm pretty sure I decided on Rg3 back then.
1250,37,32,2Nd5,b'1r2r1k1/2q2p2/2pp2pb/3n4/3P3N/R7/2Q1BPPP/3R2K1 w - -',Preventing d5 and creating a rather strong knight. That being said it does bring some trouble with it and I'm not sure if this is a blunder.
1251,37,33,2Bc4,b'1r2r1k1/2q2p2/2pp2pb/3n4/2BP3N/R7/2Q2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Pinning the knight. If I manage to play Bxd5 I'll win since he can't recapture with cxd5.  He can't defend with Re5 or Rb5 since I'll just capture them and retreating the knight means I play Nxg6. There's only one good move here in my opinion.
1252,37,34,2Qe7,b'1r2r1k1/4qp2/2pp2pb/3n4/2BP3N/R7/2Q2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Very clever moving his queen out of danger and creating ideas of Qe1+. It also attacks my knight. Talk about a multifunctional move.
1253,37,35,2g3,b'1r2r1k1/4qp2/2pp2pb/3n4/2BP3N/R5P1/2Q2P1P/3R2K1 b - -',I don't want to retreat my knight to f3. so instead i opt for g3. It creates a flight square for my king in the future or g2 can become a home for my knight if it for whatever reason wants to retreat. More importantly it defends my rather strong knight. The only issue with g3 is that my rook can't get to there now but I was planning to push my f-pawn in the future and attack that way.
1254,37,36,2Kh8,b'1r2r2k/4qp2/2pp2pb/3n4/2BP3N/R5P1/2Q2P1P/3R2K1 w - -',He finally gets his king the littlest bit safer since Qxg6 isn't a check anymore. Better might have been Kh7.

1258,37,40,2Nxg6+,b'1r2r2k/4qp2/3p2N1/3p4/3P1b2/R5P1/2Q4P/3R2K1 b - -',Although it seems strange it's the only way that doesn't lose material and more importantly his pawn will get on g6 undefended so it's a potential target in the future. I will also most likely get a passed pawn on either the h or f-file if it comes down to an endgame.
1259,37,41,Rbc8,b'2r1r2k/4q3/3p2p1/3p4/3P1P2/R7/2Q4P/3R2K1 w - -',My opponent offers up the pawn on g6. I'm fine with that since Rh3 will be checkmate if my queen can get on g6.
1260,37,42,Reg8,b'2r3rk/4q3/3p2Q1/3p4/3P1P2/R7/7P/3R2K1 w - -',Cleverly pinning the queen and king. Sadly for him he doesn't have the time to take advantage of the pin.
1261,37,43,3Rh3+,b'2r3rk/4q3/3p2Q1/3p4/3P1P2/7R/7P/3R2K1 b - -',Here my opponent resigns since after Qh7 Rxh7+ there's nothing he can do. My opponent played well considering how little time he used ( he ended up using 40 minutes of his 1.5 hours ) and the position never reached a stage where either one of us was down 1 according to computer analysis but it makes me wonder what he could have come up with had he used more of his time. My performance wasn't as convincing as I had liked either but it'll do. This game is the first out of 9 games that will be played. I started well hopefully my second game has the same result.
1262,38,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is the Phildor Defense

1266,38,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - c6',!? This isn't really recommended in the Phildor as black's DSB becomes infinitely worse as well as making a potential hole on d5. 
1267,38,5,Nf5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p2N2/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',!? Usually I play Nf3 but I was feeling in an adventurous mood. I like this move because is places the knight close to the king in case of a potential attack and if black chooses to exchange it gets rid of their bishop pair and puts a nice attacking pawn on f5.
1268,38,6,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/2p2P2/2B3P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - g3',At this point it was all or nothing. I was really interested to see if this plan of mine would work.

1272,38,10,1Rf8,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2np4/2p2PPQ/2B5/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Better was probably either Nce5 or Nde5. Both those moves bring another defender to black's king.
