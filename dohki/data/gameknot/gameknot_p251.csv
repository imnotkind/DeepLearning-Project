0,0,0,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Playing f3 forces the game to going toward quieter lines that are less dangerous. The disadvantage is that White has a problem developing his king's knight. 
1,0,1,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP2B1/4P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',played to provoke a weakness on the side that black intends to castle on

8,0,8,1Qd2,b'r1b2rk1/1p3pb1/pq1p1npp/2pPn3/P3P3/2N1BP2/1P1QBNPP/R3K2R b KQ -',defending b2 and creating a battering ram along the c1-h6 diagonal.

15,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here is one of my best games playing as black. I feel I executed very well this game. Feel free to comment. 
16,1,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Not how I normally counter against e4. But I have been doing a little research on chess openings and want to try some different things. 
17,1,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Text book Caro-Kann defence. 
18,1,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This was not a strong move for me. Bf5 would have been better.

21,1,6,1Kd2,b'r3k2r/1p1bbpp1/1q2p2p/p2pPn2/P1pP4/N1B2NP1/nPPKQPBP/3RR3 b kq -',That pesky Bishop on c3 is going to be my biggest problem right now.

25,2,0,f6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp4pp/4ppb1/2ppP3/3P2PP/2N5/PPP1NP2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black has played both pawn breaks (c5 and f6) to liquidate the center and occupy it.  Liquidation of the center  suits White since he has a lead in development.
26,2,1,Bg2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp4pp/4ppb1/2ppP3/3P2PP/2N5/PPP1NPB1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Main line is 8 h5.
27,2,2,cxd4,b'r2qkbnr/pp4pp/2n1ppb1/3pP3/3p1PPP/2N5/PPP1N1B1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',this leads to the win of White's c2 pawn at the cost of putting White even further ahead in development. 9...Nge7 is the normal move.
28,2,3,1f5,b'r2qkbnr/pp4pp/4pp2/3pPP2/3Q2PP/2N5/PPb3B1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White tries to breakthrough the center to make his lead in development tell.  12 Be3 is probably better and would give White a small edge.
29,2,4,1Rh2,b'r2qkb1r/pp2n1pp/5p2/3BPp2/3Q2PP/2N5/PPb4R/R1B1K3 b Qkq -',14 exf6 is probably better after ...Nxd5 15 Nxd5 White has a small edge.
30,2,5,1e6+,b'r2q1b1r/pp3kpp/4Pp2/3N1p2/Q3b1PP/8/PP5R/R1B1K3 b Q -',Here Black timed out.  17 Nc3 would be an equal position.  After the text (17 e6 ) White is lost according to Fritz.  Maybe so but it would take precise defense.
31,3,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',English opening. I'm starting to use this opening in my last games.

59,4,16,2Nf6+,b'2bnkbQ1/p4pB1/4pNp1/3pP1N1/3p4/q7/4rPPP/5RK1 b - -',Black resigns because the only move (Kd7) is met by Qf8  
60,5,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. .......... Nf6 - A Petrov's Defense!  - I respond with the standard move Nxe5.  Many moons ago on gameknot I tried The Petrov 3 Knights but it did not work out although the game was against a 2100  Expert (See the Long Lost Battle for how that game went).
61,5,1,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',6. Bd3 - the last moves have been very bookish - I now play Bd3 to enable me to castle kingside and to shoo away the enemy knight.
62,5,2,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qpp4/8/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',6. ............ Qb6?? - an agressive looking move but it drops a whole piece!
63,5,3,1Qc2,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bppp/1qp5/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQ2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',10. Qc2 - protecting the b2 pawn should Frere Lenoir wish to move somewhere else - Glenda is together with Frere Leblanc also eyeing up the h7 pawn.  This will induce the following weakness.

This is the first time on gameknot that I have sacrificed a piece when material has been relatively even - only a piece up here.  Even if the sac does not work I may still end up a clear pawn or two to the good which should be enough to secure an endgame victory.
67,5,7,1Nxg6,b'rn2r1k1/1p1bbp1p/1qp3NB/3p4/p2P4/2PB4/PPQN1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',16. Nxg6 - black tries to counter on the queenside with her pawn push to a4 - she does not know what I am going to unleash on her - although black is a piece down you would not believe that on move 15 she was going to cop Old Matey 4 moves down the line.

Rf8 - allows a forced mate in 5 moves I play my next move Bxh7  and I then sent my opponent a pm announcing mate in 5 providing analysis.  She played Kf7 which allowed mate on the move.  But what if she had played Kh8 - can you the jury find the mate?  Answers on a postcard.  Cheers.  Joanne

186,11,4,1Bd3,b'2r2rk1/1p1b1ppp/1q1Pp3/p2n4/5P2/3B1N2/PPPQ2PP/K2R3R b - -',17. Bd3 - I now complete my development with this multi-purpose move.  Firstly it connects my two rooks.  Frere Leblanc defends the c2 pawn and is lined up on the h7 square which will become the focal point for a match turning combo later on.
187,11,5,2g3,b'2r3k1/1p1r1pp1/1q1Pp2p/p2n4/5P2/3B2P1/PPPQ3P/K2R3R b - -',20. g3 - I decide to back up my f4 pawn - the d6 pawn is a gonner but it is poisoned!  You will see how after black's next move.
188,11,6,2c4,b'2r3k1/1p3pp1/1q1rp2p/p2n4/2P2P2/3B2P1/PP1Q3P/K2R3R b - c3',21. c4!! - After this move the knight must move allowing a discovered attack.
189,11,7,2Bh7+,b'2r3k1/1p3ppB/1q1rp2p/p7/1nP2P2/6P1/PP1Q3P/K2R3R b - -',22. Bh7  - here it is - a discovered attack.  This is different to a discovered check because the piece which is in line with the discovery is not the king.  The king is in check though and black must deal with that.  Her best move is to take Frere Leblanc which she does but this allows me to take the rook on d6 as d6 is only defended by the Wicked Witch of the West whereas Glenda and one of my rooks is trained on that square.  So black now drops the exchange.
190,11,8,Qc5,b'2r5/1p3ppk/4p2p/p1q5/1nP2P2/6P1/PP1Q3P/K2R3R w - -',24. ........ Qc5 - black does not wish to trade queens as if you are down in material you need to trade pawns rather than pieces - also it will snuff out any counterplay that black will have.  I think that Qe4 may have been stronger than the text move here though as it gangs up on c2.
191,11,9,Rxc4,b'8/1p3ppk/n3p2p/p7/2r2P2/P5P1/1P5P/K2R3R w - -',27. ............ Rxc4 - I decided to hand back a pawn for the exchange to get the queens off.  With my next move I regain the pawn and once again emerge a clear exchange up.
192,11,10,3Kb1,b'8/5pp1/4p1kp/1Rn5/p1r2P2/P5P1/1P5P/1K5R b - -',31. Kb1 - not 31. Ra5?? - this allows Nb3 forking king and rook.
193,11,11,3Rb4,b'8/5pp1/4p1kp/8/pR2rP2/Pn4P1/1P5P/1K1R4 b - -',33. Rb4 - I am prepared to double my queenside pawns to get the rooks off.  I will still be able to pick off the black a pawn and support one of my queenside pawns through to crown.
194,11,12,3Rxa4,b'8/5pp1/4p1kp/8/R4P2/Pn4P1/1P2r2P/1K1R4 b - -',34. Rxa4 - here I was wondering whether it was better to back up my h pawn.  However after black's 35th move it turned out to be the right decision.
195,11,13,Nd2+,b'8/5pp1/4p1kp/8/1R3P2/P5P1/1P1n3r/1K1R4 w - -',35. ........ Nd2 ?? - black cannot resist giving this check.  Nc5 would have complicated things but I think white was still winning there.
196,11,14,3Kc1,b'8/5pp1/4p1kp/8/1R3P2/P5P1/1P1n3r/2KR4 b - -',"36. Kc1!! - the winner - even Henry comes to the party.  The black knight will be trapped.  Black's best move which avoids immediate material loss is Nf3 and after Rb3 Rf2 but then I will play a4 and how can black preserve her knight and stop Glenda from making an appearance on a8?

Here is the answer.  Black timed out!  I gained 9.2 points out of this and this brought up my current rating 1721 - my highest rating so far on gameknot and in my entire life.  At least it will take more than one bad loss to put me under the 1700 watermark.  I just hope I can carry on the good work and have more won games up in this gallery!

Cheers everyone!

Why would he give me his knight it doesnt make sense I cant see the difference it makes to my defence situation.  perhaps he is trying to tempt me into taking the knight to then try for his bishop so when he takes my knight with g7 pawn the g File is open for his rook.   (after annotation and discussion I realised I was completely oblivious to the fact he actually took my bishop here)

Jim West once wrote about 1.b3 and the idea of using systems playable for Black that with colors reversed and extra tempo become favorable to White. This is the first such game in which I explored this theme since reading about it on Mr. West's blog sometime last year.

339,15,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Stops the creation of a Maroczy bind pawn structure by White which would have otherwise been an option.
340,15,3,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/2P5/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',Offering the d-pawn. Interestingly most of Jim West's own games feature Black playing d6 instead of d5.

342,15,5,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',An Open Sicilian position via transposition but with colors reversed. The move 5...Qxd5 can be seen in Fischer-Tukmakov Buenos Aires 1970 and in a small handful of games here on Gameknot.
343,15,6,Qc2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb4/3np3/8/PP2P3/1BQP1PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',The Gameknot database has two common paths from here: 7.d3 0-0 8.Nf3 and 7.Qc2 0-0 8.Nf3. When comparing the Gameknot and World databases it is hard to determine which path is better. Whether or not the Queen is better on c2 or another square is something I haven't determined yet.
344,15,7,d3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb4/3np3/8/PP1PP3/1BQ2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQ -',White has constructed a Hedgehog-like pawn wall on the third row.

346,15,9,Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nb4/3np3/8/PP1PP3/1BQN1PPP/R3KBNR b KQ -',The more common move is Nf3 and I'm not certain why I held off on playing it in favor of Nd2.
347,15,10,f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2nb4/3npp2/8/PP1PP3/1BQN1PPP/R3KBNR w KQ f6',An interesting idea one which I had not expected. If you switch to the World Database Black appears to score pretty well with it.
348,15,11,1Be2,b'r4rk1/pppbq1pp/2nb4/3npp2/8/PP1PPN2/1BQNBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White is now prepared to castle. The question is which side if any is better at this point.
349,15,12,1Kh1,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb1r2/3npp2/8/PP1PPN2/1BQNBPPP/R4R1K b - -',I had earlier planned on trying out the idea of a g-pawn thrust with my rooks behind it but should have reconsidered it upon seeing 9..f5 and 12.Rf6. The move 13.Kh1 to prepare this attack was kind of a waste as I never followed up this idea. The game Fischer-Andersson Siegen 1970 featured this attack plan and is discussed in Jim West's article. Imagine my surprise when Black's own g-pawn came out at me 4 moves later.
350,15,13,1Rh6,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb3r/3npp2/8/PP1PPN2/1BQNBPPP/R4R1K w - -',In another game where White's King was still on g1 Black played Rg6 here.
351,15,14,1e4,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb3r/3npp2/4P3/PP1P1N2/1BQNBPPP/R4R1K b - -',My exact reasoning for choosing e4 as a pawn break I don't remember. If Black takes with the f-pawn he will end up with an isolated e-pawn after the exchange but I don't know if I had things worked out that far at this point. Had I still planned on the g-pawn thrust getting rid of Black's f-pawn would have helped. As it was I didn't return to the idea because of the d7 Bishop and where Black's d5 Knight ended up.
352,15,15,1Nf4,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb3r/4pp2/4Pn2/PP1P1N2/1BQNBPPP/R4R1K w - -',An aggressive move keeping the Knight near White's Kingside and threatening the currently undefended e2 Bishop. The squares b6 and f6 are less useful or get in the way of the Queen and e8 Rook.
353,15,16,1Nc4,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb3r/4pp2/2N1Pn2/PP1P1N2/1BQ1BPPP/R4R1K b - -',I develop my Knight to c4 letting the Queen defend the e2 Bishop. This is an excellent square for the Knight and though it does attack e5 my actual intention is to get the Bishop pair by trading it on d6 when I get the chance.
354,15,17,1fxe4,b'4r1k1/pppbq1pp/2nb3r/4p3/2N1pn2/PP1P1N2/1BQ1BPPP/R4R1K w - -',Black defends the e5 square sufficiently to not be worried about a direct exchange but d4 could create complications. Black accepts an isolated pawn to maintain his center and counter the threat of d4.
355,15,18,g5,b'4r1k1/pppbq2p/2nb3r/4p1p1/2N1Pn2/PP3N2/1BQ1BPPP/R4R1K w - g6',I was not expecting this move and I thought for a long time about how to deal with it. The ultimate goal is to drive away the Knight on f3 by playing g4. It wasn't until later I realized that it would also allow Qh4 for a Checkmate threat. Had I played Rg1 earlier like I had planned playing g4 myself could have been an option though it would have left Black's f4 Knight in the pocket.
356,15,19,1Nxd6,b'4r1k1/pppbq2p/2nN3r/4p1p1/4Pn2/PP3N2/1BQ1BPPP/R4R1K b - -',My response instead was to continue my plan of Nxd6 and follow up with Bc4  and position the Queen on d2. The e-pawn would be pinned should Black play Kh8 or Kg8 and with my Queen sitting on the c1-h6 diagonal I would be able to take Black's Knight because of the pin and threaten Black's Rook should g4 be pushed. I felt at the time that this threat would be sufficient to deter Black from following his plan.
357,15,20,1cxd6,b'4r1k1/pp1bq2p/2np3r/4p1p1/4Pn2/PP3N2/1BQ1BPPP/R4R1K w - -',Of the two choices Qxd6 and cxd6 the later is best as otherwise I could have taken the g5 pawn for free with my Knight had Qxd6 been played. Bringing the c-pawn to d6 also supports the e5 pawn. Though there is a hole on d5 White's remaining Knight is at least four moves away from taking advantage of it.
358,15,21,1Bc4+,b'4r1k1/pp1bq2p/2np3r/4p1p1/2B1Pn2/PP3N2/1BQ2PPP/R4R1K b - -',Continuing my plan the e2 bishop takes up position on the now vacant c4 square away from the threat of Black's f4 Knight to give check. The Bishop pair is not to be underestimated. All of White's play now focuses on the e5 pin and the effect of the raking Bishops.
359,15,22,1Kh8,b'4r2k/pp1bq2p/2np3r/4p1p1/2B1Pn2/PP3N2/1BQ2PPP/R4R1K w - -',"Black has three king moves (Kh8 Kg7 and Kf8) and the move Be6 blocking check. Blocking with d5 though guarded by the f4 Knight is not an option as it would have opened the center after White takes on d5. Black would have to sacrifice the Knight to move the King to avoid d6  which wins the Queen.

Of the King moves the h8 square is best even though it allows the pin. This move would seem most intuitive if Black had planned an eventual Kh8 anyway. 

The move Be6 deserves some thought though considering what the pin on the e5 pawn allowed to happen later. The sequence 18..Be6 19.Bxe6 Nxe6 20. Qd2 Nf4 shows that Black could have maintained the protection of the g-pawn and allowed the exchange had that been a concern."
360,15,23,g4,b'4r2k/pp1bq2p/2np3r/4p3/2B1Pnp1/PP3N2/1B1Q1PPP/R4R1K w - -',I had this position sketched out on a piece of paper during a long and boring lecture class in an auditorium with uncomfortable chairs. I stared at it for a long time wondering what I had missed before realizing that Qh4 would become possible after a move like Ng1 and that h3 would be insufficient to stop checkmate along the h-file.
361,15,24,2Nxe5,b'4r2k/pp1bq2p/2np3r/4N3/2B1Pnp1/PP6/1B1Q1PPP/R4R1K b - -',After much thought I decided to try and exploit the pin along the the a1-h8 diagonal and 'sacrifice' my Knight on e5 to recreate an isolated e-pawn for Black. Should Black play 20...Qh4 now to threaten checkmate in one move I will be able to checkmate first with 21.Ng6#. 
362,15,25,2dxe5,b'4r2k/pp1bq2p/2n4r/4p3/2B1Pnp1/PP6/1B1Q1PPP/R4R1K w - -',Rather then allow the c6 Knight to become pinned on e5 this is the better choice.
363,15,26,2Qxf4,b'4r2k/pp1bq2p/2n4r/4p3/2B1PQp1/PP6/1B3PPP/R4R1K b - -',Using my earlier idea I now regain the material lost plus a pawn threaten the h6 Rook and cover the h2 pawn temporarily defusing the Qh4 checkmate threat.

Moving the Rook to cover g8 is fatal for Black. The moves after 23...Rf8 lose to 24.Qxe7 Nxe7 25.Bxe5  Rf6 26.Bxf6#. Similarly 23. Rg6 loses to 24.Qxe7 Nxe7 25.Bxe5  Rg7 26.Rad1 and the threat of backrank checkmate or further material loss. 

Best play for Black comes from 23...Qf8 guarding g8 and maintaining control of the f-file with play continuing 24.Bxe5 Nxe5 25.Qxe5 and perhaps following a sequence not unlike 25..h6 26.Rad1 Bc6 27.Rd6 Kg7 28.Rfd1. Guarding g8 with 23...Qd8 allows the d7 Bishop to be pinned later with Rad1 which is undesirable for Black.

Qc2?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong yes this move seems reasonable as it connects my rooks and adds protection to the e4 pawn but unfortunately Glenda is on the same file as an enemy rook.  Michael exploits this over the next few moves.

In a post match pm Ion had this to say ""There was nothing wrong by the way with snapping up the b-pawn at move 15.Nxb5. Black can try to exploit the WQ's conflict of interest but it costs the exchange: 15...Qb6 16.Qd3 Nxe4 17.Bxe4 Rxe4 18.Qxe4 Qxb5. White's b-pawn is probably unsalvagable so 19.Rad1 or 19.Qe7 putting pressure on the centre might be the way to go. Otherwise 15.Nxb5 Qb6 16.Qd3 c4? 17.Bxb6 cxd3 18.Bxa7 looks great for White.""

Qb1? - this move gives black a very strong initiative - he now adds weight to his strong queenside pawns by putting his knight on c5.  I moved Glenda to b1 in order to remove her from the c file and to maintain protection of e4 - but as you will see this does not wash.  Here it is folks when I am met with an attack like this I do tend to go on the defensive - it is a good habit to break and I am trying to do this but occasionally I may slip up and this is one of them.  Michael suggested that I should have moved my knight straight to f2.

Qd1 - black's pawns are now more split than they were a few moves ago but black's initiative is strengthening because his QR is really powerful on that c file.  He now adds more fuel to the fire with Bd4.  The knight on f2 is already pinned and is no doubly attacked.  I move Henry out of the pin with Kf1.

I waved the white flag as at best I would get a pawn for the rook - no way near enough.  Incredibly I overlooked this block but I don't think it changed the result in any way as if I had moved Glenda to the back rank instead of to c4 then I would have been the exchange down in a totally passive position - so I tried to complicate things but it did not work.  So how good is the Four Pawns attack?  You the jury decide.
440,20,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An unusual defence to the King's Gambit and since it slows Black's development while doing nothing to make White work for the f4 pawn I doubt it's especially sound. In this opening White threatens to hammer away at the f-file and Black has to play actively to prevent White walking all over him.

It's less clear-cut after 3. ... g5 as after 4. ... g4 White either has to sacrifice a piece (5. 0-0 the Muzio Gambit) or play 5. Ne5 the Salvio Gambit which doesn't quite work against good defence.

Analysing later I found that 7. Qc1 might have been even stronger as in some lines Black's Knight goes to f6 by way of g4 and then if I pin it with Bg5 Black can play ...Nxe4 because White's Queen is attacked as well as Black's.

492,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The game starts with [1.e4] King's pawn opening - that indicates a game with fast found tactics.

496,25,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The usual standard move [3.g3] is played with a modern styled bishop fight for the center. The standard line goes [1.e4 c5  2. Nc3 Nc6  3.g3 g6  4.Bg2 Bb7  5.d3 d6  6.f4 e5 (...e6 ...Nf6)]. My evaluation is that the text move fights for the center using an alternate approach. It does not appear to cause any major weaknesses for white and does develop in preparation for king-side castling. It differs from the main line in that it is not an aggressive approach to fighting for the center which may afford black opportunities for gaining the initiative.

The plan is development for king-side castling. When faced with unusual openings I try to envision a similar opening formation and look for positional weakness and piece mobility considerations. This position affords white 2 ready knights but neither can move forward because of preventative play by black. The flank pawn at c5 is ready exchange after [d2-d4].

It presents a pseudo pin on the knight (because of the pawn at d7) and threatens to exchange [BxN]. But what is gained by such a move? Lets evaluate the position: the c6 knight is influencing the center by preventing [Nf3-e5] but it is not guarding any pieces so an exchange by say [4...a6 5.Bxc6  bxc6] has the effect of strengthening the center for black by bringing the b7 pawn to c6 where it controls d5 and c5 which works against the c3 knight. The result is a half-open b file for the black rook and a bishop advantage for black and strong central control. This appears to offer black advantages in the center and quality of pieces and position. For this reason the move appears questionable (?!) and would require some proof of concept to see what it gains. The exchange does allow [Nf3-e5] where it influences (g6f7d7c6) and does take some work to extricate by black with perhaps (...a6 ...Qc7 ...d6) and meanwhile there is an open diagonal for white [Qg4  Nf6] but castling must wait until the weakness of g7 is resolved (weak because the f8 bishop must develop before castling).

A good idea would be to bring the knight and king into the arena if possible.

I rate the move highly because of the applied concept and because of how it makes the rook appear completely helpless boxed in at d8. True that the rook condition is merely transitional but it does highlight how badly placed pieces become ineffective and can be made more ineffective. The rook is only out of play on this move but the opponent must find another piece to move or play an unwanted sacrifice exchange.

The move is give a strong rating because it uses an attack to force the opponent to protect the pawn and this allows the knight to move with tempo while maneuvering to c4 where it removes the blockader of the pawn (by threat of exchange) allowing black to achieve goals while preventing white from achieving good counter-play.

But this move shuts off a square that either the King's Knight or the Queen badly needed - and now they plus the Bishop are all fighting over e7 and three into one won't go.

To make matters worse the move weakens both diagonals running through f7 meaning that after White's next Black will be unable to castle for some time to come and will be at risk of a check from h5 (see move 10).

If you look at this position in a simple way the following is true. the weak pawns are c2/c7 f2/f7 e4/e5. Pretty much the same strengths and weaknesses. The real difference is that I can castle long getting my King to safety and developing my Q rook. I can get my other rook to the centre easily enough. You cannot get your K to safety without trapping a rook or compromising your position in some manner. These are probably the reasons why Black doesn't play this sort of stuff at the highest levels.

Forcing h4 means that there is one less pawn defending the B on g3. This doesn't mean much right now but it allows tactics based on a future Bg4 hitting the R on d1 then the N on h6 goes to f5 hitting the B on g3. If the N can take the B on g3 then my pawn structure will be pawns on g2g3h4 which means your pawn on e4 is a passed pawn. look at this possible line. 9...h5 10.h4 Nh6 11.a3 Bg4 12.Nge2 e3 13.fxe3 Bxe3  14.Kb1 Nf5 and black has a bit of play. Of course White must be careless to allow this but you would be giving yourself more opportunities by forcing small weaknesses on your opponent. Perhaps even something like this Bc5 
9. Bg3 h5 10. h4 Rh6 11. Re1 a6 12. Bxc6  Rxc6 13. Nxe4 Bb6 14. Nf3 Nh6"

With the Qs off you are unlikely to be able to use the open b file to mate me.In the long term your Q side pawns represent a winning position for me. AT this point I looked at 2 ways to play this position. Firstly to go for the Q side pawns by Na5 Nge2c4-c5 Nd4. Secondly to go for the e4 pawn. 
588,27,9,Bb4,b'r3k1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/4Pb2/1b2p3/2N3B1/PPP2PPP/2K1R1NR w - -',Best move although h5 again could be considered

593,27,14,1Ra3,b'3rk2r/2p2ppp/2p5/4P3/pP2b1n1/R5B1/1PP1NPPP/2K4R b - -',I couldn't decide whether I wanted to play Rc3 or Ra3. Rc3 stops you moving your B to g6. All in all I thought I'd just win your a4 pawn. It isn't doing any damage at the moment but a pawn is a pawn and I can't see you doing any damage while I waste time picking it up.

While I had counted on Kc4 and had worked out how to eliminate White's Bishop by sacrificing my Knight and a pawn for it I had not counted on Kc2 which would have left me with two undefended pieces that were simultaneously threatened. I could do one of three things:

1). Go for a Rook vs Bishop and Knight endgame where I had 4 pawns to White's 3 after a sequence like 30.Kc2 Rb4 31.Nxd5 Rc4  32.Kd3 Rxc5 

2). I could trade away all the pieces with 30.Kc2 Rxc3 31.Bxc3 Nxc3 32.Kxc3 Kc6 and settle for blockading the c5 pawn with my King with only a slight positional advantage of an extra King side pawn or 

3). I could go for a Knight vs Bishop endgame with equal amounts of pawns using the sequence 30.Kc2 Rxc3 31.Bxc3 Kc6 and then followed by Kxc6 the next move. Of the three the largest chances of a draw would come from this one.

None of these really appealed to me though. Would 29...Nxd5 30.Kc2 have cost me the game? Maybe maybe not. But Kc2 would have equalized for White in most of the scenarios I envisioned and I would have thrown away my two point advantage I had worked so hard for.

852,34,50,3Rc3,b'8/3k2pp/5p2/2P3N1/4K1P1/2r5/7P/8 w - -',I move away and threaten the c5 pawn. With White's King now sitting on e4 the Knight can not return in time to guard the pawn which would force Kd4 to save it.
853,34,51,3Nxh7,b'8/3k2pN/5p2/2P5/4K1P1/2r5/7P/8 b - -',Rather then get cut off from the remaining pawns White leaves his King where it is and takes on h7. This pawn was bait and is part of a trap I had worked out to eliminate White's last minor piece.
854,34,52,3Ke7,b'8/4k1pN/5p2/2P5/4K1P1/2r5/7P/8 w - -',I have now successfully corralled the Knight with two pawns and my King. At the earliest possible moment I will swing over with Rh3 to capture it. White's c-pawn is three squares away from promotion but Rh3 Rxh7 and Rh8 allow me to cover the promotion square before it arrives.
855,34,53,3g5,b'8/4k1pN/5p2/2P3P1/4K3/2r5/7P/8 b - -',Of White's available moves I felt moving the King over towards the Knight would have given me the most trouble. I knew that if gxf6  was played I could maintain the trap by taking back. If White's King were parked on f5 however it would another story. 
856,34,54,3Rh3,b'8/4k1pN/5p2/2P3P1/4K3/7r/7P/8 w - -',I figure I will have enough time to take on h7 and so I move over. Yet another possibility for White I noticed at this point would have been to push 39.g6 but this would have given me a passed pawn of my own.
857,34,55,4Nxf6,b'8/4k3/5N2/2P5/4K3/7r/7P/8 b - -',Three pawns for a Knight is fairly reasonable.

859,34,57,4Ke7,b'8/4k3/8/2PK4/8/7r/7P/8 w - -',I match White's King movement with my own. By forcing White to walk in front of his pawn I give my Rook time to capture on h2 and swing over to the c-file.
860,34,58,Rxh2,b'8/4k3/2K5/2P5/8/8/7r/8 w - -',Moving Kd8 is unnecessary as there is enough time to capture and then intercept the c-pawn by the time it reaches c7.

In my game against michael I took with the c pawn instead - maybe this move is an improvement.  White can keep his kingside and queenside pawns together this way and the pawn structure may come under less strain than the other capture.  It does leave the e file open for a black rook to come on it so white would strongly be advised to castle on his next move which he does.

The intent of this move here was to get out of the pin with check and to reclaim the piece by capturing on e4 with the f pawn unfortunately white gets his knight out of the road by playing Nf2 - Ion is a piece for a pawn down.  The position is not resignable yet - remember a pawn can crown a piece cannot.  The defender must find some vigorous counterplay however or white could increase this material advantage.  Ion now creates complications and as mentioned in a previous note they earn him half a point.  I do not know the rating differentials of the two protagonists here - this could also have some bearing on the decision to play on or not.

Here Ion has managed to double rooks on the e file as I mentioned in a previous note.  He has managed to get a rook down on the 7th rank which can be a bone in the throat.  This resulted in Ion netting the b pawn and wrecking white's queenside pawn structure through the back door - black's queenside pawn structure is more intact.  Ion is also threatening a move like R x N (uncovering an attack on the a1 rook) - white sidestepps this threat with Rad1.

But what to make of the move played? White had made a simple tactical oversight. 

Ion hangs on to his f pawn because after the rooks are exchanged on f3 white must recapture with the bishop because if he recaptures with the rook he will cop Old Matey on f1.  Do note that the white rook on f3 will interefere with the white bishop's diagonal onto d1.

Ordinarily Black would avoid exchanges but I was hoping to round up White's a-pawn.

898,36,1,O-O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2KR1BNR b - -',This surprised me a bit here.  The thematic response to the Yugoslav attack is the d5 break.  This has also already occurred.  The Yugoslav is a fairly good tool by white against the Dragon variation of the Sicilian defense.  Some notable differences are present here:  Black gained time by deploying the bishop to e7 where the g6 pawn push was unnecessary.  If white exchanges knight for bishop Black will have a strongly fortified g7 square and the diagonal control sought by the typical fianchetto move.  Also Black can  defend the d5 pawn without too much trouble.  Opposite castling quite often leads to pawn storms.  Because Black is more secure than in the pure Dragon formations he has more leeway to start a strong queen-side initiative.
899,36,2,Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4bn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',Thematic play in many Sicilian lines involves a rook on c8 so this move develops while strengthening d5 and clears space for the rook.
900,36,3,Bxf6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bb2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/2KR1BNR w - -',The bishop's diagonal is obscured but Black believes the c5 break should remedy this.
901,36,4,Nf3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bb2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b - -',First f4 is advisable.  White's gameplan calls for a king-side push and Nf3 prevents the f pawn from cooperating in the attack.
902,36,5,Qe7,b'rn3rk1/ppp1qppp/4bb2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R w - -',Three main purposes exist here.  First c5 is now possible as b4 can no longer discourage the black advance owing to Qxb4.  Second c8 is a great place for a rook.  Third the knight needs to be developed.  If Qd7 then the b knight must wait for pawn advances or obscure a pawn's cooperation in the initiative.
903,36,6,1Kb1,b'rn3rk1/ppp1qppp/4bb2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/1K1R1B1R b - -',White is wasting time to see how black will begin but this is very dangerous.  Black's attack once begun is likely to be fast.  White is behind in development and has neglected the typical counterplay.  The only useful motive here is freeing the c knight from the defense of the a pawn.  White has a handful of more useful moves most of which mobilize the kingside.
904,36,7,1c5,b'rn3rk1/pp2qppp/4bb2/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/1K1R1B1R w - c6',I partly wonder whether Rc8 first was more accurate.  The queen is not best situated on c5 (should White decide to exchange).

906,36,9,1Nxd4,b'rn3rk1/pp2qppp/4bb2/1Q1p4/3N4/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R b - -',White forced an IQP position.  Currently the d5 pawn seems overpowered.  White is in no real jeopardy and has some real tactical threats that can force concessions by black.  White also solved the problem at least temporarily of the f pawn.
907,36,10,1Rc8,b'rnr3k1/pp2qppp/4bb2/1Q1p4/3N4/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R w - -',I neglected the threat of Nxd5.  This line is at least equal if not better for white.  Black has no reason to fear Nxe6.

909,36,12,1fxe6,b'rnr3k1/pp2q1pp/4pb2/1Q1p4/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R w - -',Black not only gets rid of the isolated pawn but secures a fairly strong center too.  This comes at the cost of the bishop pair.

920,36,23,Kf8,b'r1r2k2/2q3pQ/p1n2b1p/1p6/8/3B3P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R w - -',I knew Kf7 was terrible after Bg6  where white gets to continue the plan with tempo.
921,36,24,2Qh8+,b'r1r2k1Q/2q3p1/p1n2b1p/1p6/8/3B3P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R b - -',The weaker move.  Kf7 creates a discovered attack against the White queen.  White has in essence given time to black once again.  Black gladly uses the time to prepare a defense of his King.
922,36,25,2Qh7,b'r1r5/2q2kpQ/p1n2b1p/1p6/8/3B3P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R b - -',I need a defense of g6.
923,36,26,2Ne5,b'r1r5/2q2kpQ/p4b1p/1p2n3/8/3B3P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R w - -',Perhaps Ne7 was better because it also controls f5 but I liked the move because I needed the c pawn's defender removed.  It also dampens the threat of Re1.  (The idea of trading rook for a major defender of the black kingside is probably worth exploring.)
924,36,27,2Be4,b'r1r5/2q2kpQ/p4b1p/1p2n3/4B3/7P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R b - -',I think this works to my favor.
925,36,28,a5,b'1rr5/2q2kp1/5b1p/pp2nQ2/4B3/7P/PPP2PP1/1K1R3R w - -',White currently has a comfortable game but has to play carefully.  Black must be wary too because the black king is vulnerable.
926,36,29,2f4,b'1rr5/2q2kp1/5b1p/pp2nQ2/4BP2/7P/PPP3P1/1K1R3R b - f3',I have to defend g6 so my immediate options are limited.
927,36,30,2Qe4,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/pp1Bn3/4QP2/7P/PPP3P1/1K1R3R b - -',Now I can withdraw the knight.
928,36,31,2Nc4,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/pp1B4/2n1QP2/7P/PPP3P1/1K1R3R w - -',To be clear I was contemplating taking his b pawn but I couldn't imagine it happening with proper defense.
929,36,32,2Bxc4,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/pp6/2B1QP2/7P/PPP3P1/1K1R3R b - -',"?? This move surprised me.  I think even if he ""wins back"" the pawn he is down it does so at too great a cost."
930,36,33,2bxc4,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/p7/2p1QP2/7P/PPP3P1/1K1R3R w - -',He now must deal with a strong attack on his b pawn.  He lost the initiative and is on the defensive.  I think Re1 has been called for repeatedly in this game.  He can still storm with g4 but his King will get flushed out into the open board before he can capitalize on the weak black Kingside.
931,36,34,3b3,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/p7/2p1QP2/1P5P/P1P3P1/1K1R3R b - -',An idea blossomed in my mind.
932,36,35,3axb3,b'1rr5/2q3k1/5bpp/p7/4QP2/1P5P/2P3P1/1K1R3R b - -',Honestly I'm unsure how I thought he would deal with the threat.  His position is crumbling.
933,36,36,3Rxb3+,b'2r5/2q3k1/5bpp/p7/4QP2/1r5P/2P3P1/1K1R3R w - -',Let me help the collapse!  I honestly expected a resignation from my opponent after this move.  If Kc1 now the black initiative is strong allowing black to accumulate advantages.
934,36,37,Qc3,b'2r5/6k1/5bpp/p7/4QP2/1Pq4P/6P1/1K1R3R w - -',Perhaps a resignation after this move?  It is clear at this point that the only way to prevent mate is to give back some of the material black sacrifised.  I considered Qc3 prior to Rxb3  but the move reveals the hand earlier so to speak and White could play Kc1 stepping out of the net if Black plays Qa1 .
935,36,38,Kf8,b'2r2k2/3R4/5bpp/p7/4QP2/1Pq4P/6P1/1K5R w - -',Still threatening mate.
936,36,39,3Rf7+,b'2r2k2/5R2/5bpp/p7/4QP2/1Pq4P/6P1/1K5R b - -',Yes I have to take back the material.
937,36,40,3Qd5+,b'2r5/5k2/5bpp/p2Q4/5P2/1Pq4P/6P1/1K5R b - -',I really didn't have to think too long to come up with a plan to deal with this.  White would love to force a draw by threefold repetition here.
938,36,41,Kh8,b'2r4k/8/4Qbpp/p7/5P2/1Pq4P/6P1/1K5R w - -',The rook sacrifice no longer looks like a sacrifice.
939,36,42,Qf5+,b'7k/8/5bpp/p4q2/5P2/1P5P/6P1/1KR5 w - -',Much of the rest of the game was played with conditional moves programmed.
940,36,43,4Rc2,b'7k/8/5bpp/p4q2/5P2/1P5P/2R3P1/1K6 b - -',Pins his only minor piece left but I would have to maintain the queen's position.  It's like I lose a queen when he loses a rook.  Why help his cause?
941,36,44,4Ka2,b'7k/8/5bpp/p7/5q2/1P5P/K1R3P1/8 b - -',Expected anything else because all I want is to move my queen to the 1st rank.
942,36,45,4Qf1,b'7k/8/5bpp/p7/8/1P5P/K1R3P1/5q2 w - -',Threatening mate.  Actually it isn't so much threatened as forced:
943,36,46,Kg7,b'2R5/6k1/5bpp/p7/8/1P5P/K5P1/5q2 w - -',These king advances to challenge the rook were another set of conditional moves.
944,36,47,4Rc2,b'5k2/8/5bpp/p7/8/1P5P/K1R3P1/5q2 b - -',He sees that the challenge is fruitless but given that he had not resigned I expected them to continue until the rook was captured followed by b4 and a5.

Black is forced to take the knight to avoid mate by Qxh7#. He can either take with the pawn which leads to a quick win for white or he can take with be bishop which leaves white with good advantage. Here are the options:
25.Nf6  gxf6 26.gxf6 Kh8 27.Qg5 Rg8 28.fxe7 and white is winning. Or 25.Nf6  Bxf6 26.gxf6 g6 (not gxf6?) 27.Qg5 which I think wins quicker than what Fischer played. What do you guys think??

I am annotating this game to highlight the effect that ignoring bishop/knight imbalances can have on a game. I felt the game was played fairly solidly on Whites side and that all the advantages he gained were mainly black not pursuing a coherent strategy with respect to the structure as defined above. "

This seems dangerous to me since you give white the ability to secure space which he can then use to grind you down over time."

White protects its pawns black moves to attack whites knights because the game from here looks to be closed. I.E. strategy is to attack the opponents closed pieces with your open pieces to create an imbalance between your pieces that are stronger when closed and his pieces which are stronger when open.

The line that usually follows is 7. Nc3..e6. Which gives the d knight a post and makes it harder for white to open up the center of the board when black decides to trade his bishop for a knight forcing the imbalance.

That never happens."

Not only has he given up the center of the board but he is undeveloped and Whites pawn structure(that cascade thing which i can't remember the name of) makes his white bishop even stronger.

Blacks white bishop is already constrained and is about to be constrained even farther. As handy as it is to develop the other bishop Black is developing this bishop into a position it can make little use of. It only has one square it can move into. Despite the black cascade whites black bishop has many more options and a much larger sphere of influence

The game which should have been about black hammering home a post on d5 is now about White owning the queen side of the board."

This would have weakened whites ability to attack on the queen side now with only one strong piece. And would have let black open up the board with some more pawn sacrifices and play on his then 2 bishop advantage. "
