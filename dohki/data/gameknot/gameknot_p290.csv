15,0,15,1c5,b'1qkr3r/pp3ppp/1n1bpnb1/1NP5/1P6/PQ2B1N1/4BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',It looks like black can get out of the pin without any loss of material. However position count's in chess too!

46,1,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I'm deciding to play Queen's Gambit - my second favorite opening overall (first being Sicilian of course! (duh))
47,1,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Wow! Esthetically speaking this just looks so cool! I didn't even know what the opening was called back then. Now that I look it up I learn that it is called Austrian defence. 
48,1,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here the database shows cxd5 as the most popular move. Maybe because after Qxd5 white plays Nf3 and is ahead in developing minor pieces. Or the game can also progress like this - 3)cxd5 Qxd5 4) Nc3! Qxd4 5)Qxd4 cxd4 Nb5! - I think this variation is dynamic and very good for white. But regardless I chose to play Nf3 because I didn't want to mess up the four pawn structure on the left side of the board. It's something like a deadlock between soldiers before the commence of a HUGE battle!
49,1,4,Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q1pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',did I say a deadlock?! The black queen pounces right in to attack my king
50,1,5,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q1pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"Here I also had Bd2 but I think Nc3 makes more of a statement in saying that ""You shall not pass"" (sorry had to quote Gandalf here :P ). Bd2 is decent but two knights standing guard to your fortress just has some kickassness to it :P. "
51,1,6,e6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/q1pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black wants to open up the bishop diagonal and break white's pawn structure by doing cxd4
52,1,7,Bd2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/q1pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"Here I just make a threat for black's queen. If my knight moves the bishop will be ready to snipe the queen. It's best for the black queen to retreat from my black bishop's ""line of fire"". "

56,1,11,cxd4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/3bp3/q7/2Bp4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White should develop some more artillery before trying to invade the white camp at this point. A bishop and both knights are still sitting at home squares.  
57,1,12,Nxd4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/3bp3/q7/2BN4/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Fancier than exd4! :P

65,1,20,1Bxb4+,b'rn4nr/pp1k1p1p/6p1/q3pN2/1BB5/4P3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',BAM the King has been checked!

The setups have to subtle but vital differences however both of which are in blacks favour. The first is that black waited to play 11. dxc4 until after white's king bishop moved and this strategic delay gained a tempo for black.The second difference is that the black queen is better placed on e7 than whites queen on d2. Black's queen is safe while the white queen is exposed on the open-d file. Are these small advantages enough to win. Maybe- maybe only if your name is Rubinstein!
105,3,11,1Qe2,b'r1br2k1/4qppp/p1nbpn2/1p6/1P6/P1NBPN2/1B2QPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',The queen steps aside feeling uncomfortabe on the same file as the rook. This loses white another tempo.

122,4,0,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',The Nimzo-Larsen Attack. This is not the strongest opening but may offer psychological advantages. I feel comfortable playing this opening.
123,4,1,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black blocks his d-pawn. He should have either advanced the e-pawn or played d6. If black had played d5 on move 3 he would not have this trouble.
124,4,2,exd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3p4/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',I don't agree with this move. I feel that black should have advanced to e4 and retained at least some hold on the center. Now white can gain control of the center. 
125,4,3,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',It would be foolish to take with the bishop instead of the knight first wouldn't it? We definately don't want to give up that bishop so easily; it is the star of the Nimzo-Larsen opening. 
126,4,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',Black has more pieces developed but his pawn on d7 is cramping up his position and white has a stronger center.
127,4,5,Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',Developing and getting ready to castle. It is more common to play Be2 or Bb5 in the Nimzo-Larsen but this is a somewhat strange position for this opening. My light-squared bishop is now eyeing h7. 
128,4,6,Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3n4/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',The pressure! The knights were just looking at each other waiting to see who would take first!
129,4,7,Bxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3B4/1P1BP3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',The theme bishop of the nimzo-larsen.
130,4,8,Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b4/3n4/3B4/1P1BP3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',This move serves to block in the d-pawn even more. Of course the knight is also looking at a nice seat on b4. Right now black's light-squared bishop is blocked in so white's bishop is that much more dominant. This means that white's light-squared bishop is a good target!
131,4,9,Bxh7+,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppB/3b4/3n4/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ -',Wow! So much more attacking that bad boy. In this position I was mainly looking at the variation Kh8 which wreaks havoc on black's position. For some reason I thought that it was also really bad to take the bishop. One of those lapses of tactical vision. 
132,4,10,1Qh5+,b'r1bq1r2/pppp1ppk/3b4/3n3Q/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',However now I can win back the material. I think this was a good choice of moves though. Black's knight could really become a nuisance on b4 and now I've gained an extra pawn and loosened up the black King's position. 
133,4,11,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqpp1/3b4/3Q4/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Lining up with the bishop. The only thing obvious for black now is using his bishop on the a3-d6 diagonal. But then black needs to chase away the white Queen if he wants free up his light-squared bishop. 
134,4,12,1h4,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqpp1/3b4/3Q4/3B3P/1P2P3/P1P2PP1/RN2K2R b KQ h3',I didn't want to castle kingside. I wanted an attack on the black King since his position is softened. And it looked like black was aiming at my kingside. Maybe I should have developed my queen's-knight and castled queenside first but I wasn't sure how I wanted to develop my knight. 
135,4,13,1c6,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pqpp1/2pb4/3Q4/3B3P/1P2P3/P1P2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',starting the kicking out of the Queen.

However I forgot about the move...
137,4,15,1f6,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pq1p1/2pb1p2/6Q1/3B3P/1P2P3/P1P2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',which chases my Queen again. It also defends against the immediate threat possibly shuts the theme bishop down and alows the black King a possible escape square.
138,4,16,c5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pq1p1/3b1p2/2p2Q2/3B3P/1P2P3/P1P2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',I'm not sure of black's intention but I do know that I can simply retreat and now there are some more holes in black's position. 
139,4,17,Bc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppbpq1p1/5p2/2p2Q2/7P/1P2P3/PBP2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',preparing to advance the pawn with attack.

141,4,19,1d6,b'r1b2rk1/ppb1q1p1/3p1p2/2p2Q2/7P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Chasing the white Queen yet again. She must be really attractive :D. I want to station my Queen on d3 but I have some other ideas first. 
142,4,20,1Qd5+,b'r1b2rk1/ppb1q1p1/3p1p2/2pQ4/7P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',I thought I could manage to squeeze just a little more damage from the black position. There is nothing big; I just thought that I would rather the black Queen be attack my pawn chain than the bishop (who would want to give a queen for a pawn?) so this longer route may accomplish something small. Of course black can block with the bishop and lose his queenside pawn majority. I was also ok with The black King moving onto the some file as my rook. Also I was fine if the rook blocked the check because it seems to disharmonize the black pieces a little and blocks f7 as an escape square for the black King. Then I would just move on to d3 and if black wanted the small little positional things back then he could move back to the original position and I would have in effect gotten to move twice in a row. I wanted to poke his position a little. I forgot though that if his queen blocked the check she could move out by Qf5 and not lose a tempo and then I might want to just trade queens when black blocks the check. This would of course put his bishop in a more active position and would have linked his rooks. It may have been safer to just move straight to d3. 
143,4,21,1Be6,b'r4rk1/ppb1q1p1/3pbp2/2pQ4/7P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',My gamble worked out ok this time though. Black fell for the small trap...

145,4,23,1Qf7,b'r4rk1/pQb2qp1/3pbp2/2p5/7P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',There is a lot or queen manuevering in this game. This actually surprised me a little. I wasn't expecting a counter attack so quick. Black threatens c4 and if I'm not careful I can lose my theme bishop. Not to worry though...
146,4,24,1Qe4,b'r4rk1/p1b2qp1/3pbp2/2p5/4Q2P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',because the Queen is quite a capable girl and black's threats are at least temporarily thwarted. I have gotten her back into the middle of things where she seems to love it. She doesn't have to worry about evil rooks breathing revenge down the b-file either. 
147,4,25,1Bd5,b'r4rk1/p1b2qp1/3p1p2/2pb4/4Q2P/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',A good move I must say. My poor Queen could get in trouble real fast and she's the only one who can protect the sensetive g2 pawn right now (If I'm to save my Queen that is).
148,4,26,Be6,b'r4rk1/p1b2qp1/3pbp2/2p5/6QP/1P2P3/PBPN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Black is really going after that Queen. That black bishop either has a crush or a hatred! Things are starting to get a little heated for her now. She better watch out. 
149,4,27,2Qe2,b'r4rk1/p1b2qp1/3pbp2/2p5/7P/1P2P3/PBPNQPP1/R3K2R b KQ -',She had enough and decided that she'd just had enough of that bishop and needed some comfort from her King. 
150,4,28,2Qg6,b'r4rk1/p1b3p1/3pbpq1/2p5/7P/1P2P3/PBPNQPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Now black is getting hungry. The Queen is looking at both the d2 and g2 pawn! Black is starting to strike back. 
151,4,29,2g3,b'r4rk1/p1b3p1/3pbpq1/2p5/7P/1P2P1P1/PBPNQP2/R3K2R b KQ -',what else could the poor sensetive pawn do? He needed the support of his friends. And besides the pawn on c2 is a lot hardier so if he is taken then white's position won't be as badly damaged. 
152,4,30,2Bd5,b'r4rk1/p1b3p1/3p1pq1/2pb4/7P/1P2P1P1/PBPNQP2/R3K2R w KQ -',Ooooo. The bishop really is just mad isn't he? He just wants to take something.

154,4,32,Ba5,b'r4rk1/p5p1/3p1pq1/b1p5/7P/1P2P1P1/PBPNQP2/2K4R w - -',Trying to charge the dark-squared bishop with some energy. 
155,4,33,2h5,b'r4rk1/p5p1/3p1pq1/b1p4P/8/1P2P1P1/PBPNQP2/2K4R b - -',I want to start putting pressure on Black's kingside. My pieces are pretty well lined up for an attack and my pawns are ready to roll.

Now that I only have one rook I really need to be invading with pawns. I don't want to have an open board where the enemy rooks will be powerful. The two black pawns in the center are possible targets but I must be careful before black may use them as a springboard for his own attack. 
157,4,35,2d5,b'r4rk1/p5p1/5p1q/b1pp3P/5P2/1P2P1P1/PBPNQ3/2K4R w - -',Black is trying to apply his own pressure on my King. White should be trying to lock up the center or neutralizing the pawns. Otherwise black can really weaken  white's queenside.
158,4,36,2c4,b'r4rk1/p5p1/5p1q/b1pp3P/2P2P2/1P2P1P1/PB1NQ3/2K4R b - c3',White is now contesting black's advance; he has enough material in the vicinity to do it and if he just sits back and waits black can start to mess up white's pawn structure. 
159,4,37,Bc7,b'r4rk1/p1b3p1/5p1q/2p4P/2N2P2/1P2P1P1/PB2Q3/2K4R w - -',The bishop must retreat but he still wants a little bit of activity and decides to put a little pressure on the white queenside. White's theme bishop however is still sitting back next to his master like a dog waiting to be let off the leash. He hungrily is eyeing the two remaining black kingside pawns and the sensitive square h8.
160,4,38,2Ba3,b'r4rk1/p1b3p1/5p1q/2p4P/2N2P2/BP2P1P1/P3Q3/2K4R b - -',The master sends the dog to attack. Black will lose his last offending pawn but may try to use this as a line of attack for a rook. 
161,4,39,2Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/p1b3p1/5p1q/2p4P/2N2P2/BP2P1P1/P3Q3/2K4R w - -',Black puts his rook on the same file as the white Queen and eyes the tender pawn on e3. I was actually wondering when black would do this; it seemed inevitable. 
162,4,40,3Bxc5,b'r3r1k1/p1b3p1/5p1q/2B4P/2N2P2/1P2P1P1/P3Q3/2K4R b - -',Now of course my forces are anchored around the pawns on e3 and h5 and the black rook loses his hope of a penetrating the white position on the e-file. It seems that the rook should have been placed on c8 instead where he pressures the kingside. However later in the game white's attack may have been much more powerful without substantial coverage of the e6 square or an escape square on for the king via c8. 
163,4,41,3g5,b'r3r1k1/p1b5/5p1q/2B3pP/2N2P2/1P2P1P1/P3Q3/2K4R w - g6',Striking out against the hungry white pawns utilizing the fact that the e-pawn is pinned. If white retakes with the g-pawn he then has an open file to attack the black King but his passed pawn is isolated. 
164,4,42,3Qf3,b'r3r1k1/p1b5/5p1q/2B3pP/2N2P2/1P2PQP1/P7/2K4R b - -',Freeing up the e-pawn. I would still probably retake the g-pawn anyway as I like the idea of an open file with the enemy King sitting at the end. 
165,4,43,3gxf4,b'r3r1k1/p1b5/5p1q/2B4P/2N2P2/1P2PQ2/P7/2K4R b - -',Now white has unquestionable control of the kingside (and probably had it since the black d-pawn was removed). 
166,4,44,3a5,b'r3r1k1/2b5/5p1q/p1B4P/2N2P2/1P2PQ2/P7/2K4R w - a6',Trying to create opportunities for the rooks to penetrate the white King's position.

168,4,46,3Rab8,b'1r2r1k1/2b5/5p1q/p1B4P/P1N2P2/1P2PQ2/8/2K4R w - -',White's b-pawn has become vulnerable and so black attacks it. White's b-pawn will be black's target for a while. 
169,4,47,3Kb2,b'1r2r1k1/2b5/5p1q/p1B4P/P1N2P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R b - -',Giving the poor left-behind pawn some support and getting the King off of that nasty c-file. 
170,4,48,3Qh7,b'1r2r1k1/2b4q/5p2/p1B4P/P1N2P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R w - -',There is one tactical theme here that I forgot in this position. I somehow forgot that my b-pawn was pinned and my knight was in danger. I should have either moved my King to the side or moved Na3-b5 and blocked the black rook's attack. 
171,4,49,3Bd4,b'1r2r1k1/2b4q/5p2/p6P/P1NB1P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R b - -',Although this is a good move-it puts my theme bishop into a more active position where it is putting a lot of pressure on the black King's position- I should have solidified my position first. 
172,4,50,3Qf7,b'1r2r1k1/2b2q2/5p2/p6P/P1NB1P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R w - -',now I should have moved my King to the side and shut out the black Queen. I still didn't see however that my b-pawn was pinned. 
173,4,51,3h6,b'1r2r1k1/2b2q2/5p1P/p7/P1NB1P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R b - -',I thought my position was solid and so started my pawn roller. 
174,4,52,3Qxc4,b'1r2r1k1/2b5/5p1P/p7/P1qB1P2/1P2PQ2/1K6/7R w - -',Boom! This honestly caught me by surprise. Wow! I just lost a knight and now I'm about to be put in checkmate. Well I could just move Qd1 to defend but then I lose the initiative and a knight. The tension is really building! Look at my Queen and rook. They're so hungry but the black threat must be dealt with.
175,4,53,3Qg4+,b'1r2r1k1/2b5/5p1P/p7/P1qB1PQ1/1P2P3/1K6/7R b - -',Things are starting to get climactic. White has got a lot of pawn promotion ideas but Black has got a checkmate knocking at white's door. White decides to try and sneak out the back door and flank the unwanted visitor. I knew here that I could always move my queen back to a defensive position in all the lines I was looking at so I decided to see how accurately black could play. Black must play precisely or he loses everything but if he plays correctly he should be rewarded. 
176,4,54,3Kf7,b'1r2r3/2b2k2/5p1P/p7/P1qB1PQ1/1P2P3/1K6/7R w - -',Black's only move. 
177,4,55,3Qg7+,b'1r2r3/2b2kQ1/5p1P/p7/P1qB1P2/1P2P3/1K6/7R b - -',The white Queen is now filled with rage. For one she's tired of all the black pieces chasing her around but also black has threatened the life of her husband so she attacks furiously. 
178,4,56,3Qxf6+,b'1r2r3/2b5/4kQ1P/p7/P1qB1P2/1P2P3/1K6/7R b - -',Here black has two moves Kd5 and Kd7. Kd5 loses outright due to 40. Qf7  Re6  41. Rh5  Be5 (if 41. ... Kd6 42. Be5  Rxe5 43. fxe5  K moves anywhere 44. Qxc4 or 42. ... Kd5 43. Bxc7  with Bxb8 next and black has no more attack or 42. ... K moves anywhere on c-file and 43. Qxc7  Kd5 44. Qxc4 ) but Kd7 holds on. 
179,4,57,4Qf5+,b'1r2r3/2bk4/7P/p4Q2/P1qB1P2/1P2P3/1K6/7R b - -',Now black loses if he moves to a dark square except for d8 after which white forces a draw through a cool combination (If you want I'll post it. See if you can figure it out though). In any of these positions in which the white bishop remains on d4 I will gladly trade queens into an endgame where white has too many pawns for black to deal with and the bishop will trade on h8 (if black has good enough endgame technique) so the rook will be too tied up to help much. Also if the rook blocks the check when the king is on c6 or d7 I would move Qc2 where the queen gets a more aggressive defending position than on d1 and the black queen should not trade and get into the same lost endgame with the white king starting a tad closer to the center. He should retreat the queen to the kingside; this will take a little time since the rook at e6 is blocking the most convenient way of getting there. In the time it takes to get the queen into a good position white should already be able to promote his pawn or win a rook. The position explodes dynamically into the climax! What an exciting game! 
180,4,58,4Qe6,b'1r2r3/2bk4/4q2P/p4Q2/P2B1P2/1P2P3/1K6/7R w - -',Re6 may have been better. 
181,4,59,4h7,b'1r6/2bk3P/4r3/p7/P2B1P2/1P2P3/1K6/7R b - -',I believe it may have been better for black to take with his King. This is fine with me however. The climax has exploded and now things slow down to the ending of an exciting game. The marching advance of the pawn signifies the inevitable approach of doom for the black King. All the plans and tactics in the game have culminated in this position. White has a theme bishop that has played perhaps the most important role aside from the queen in the whole game. It has really seamed to hold the position together. (Of course that rook on h1 is a faithful soldier too happy with whatever his majesty commands even staying on the same square the whole game!). 
182,4,60,4Rxh8,b'1r5R/2bk4/8/p7/P2B1P2/1P2P3/1K6/8 b - -',The rook finally releases all that pent up energy.
183,4,61,4Rxh8,b'7r/2bk4/8/p7/P2B1P2/1P2P3/1K6/8 w - -',Though black should not have traded rooks the result would be the same (though it would have taken more time and effort).
184,4,62,4Bxh8,b'7B/2bk4/8/p7/P4P2/1P2P3/1K6/8 b - -',Now the Nimzo-Larsen bishop triumphantly eats the last rook on the board and becomes the master of the position. 
185,4,63,4Bd4,b'8/2b5/8/p2k4/P2B1P2/1PK1P3/8/8 b - -',The bishop is getting ready to deal with the last resistance from the black camp or to see the pawns through. 
186,4,64,Bd6,b'8/8/3b4/p7/P1KBkP2/1P2P3/8/8 w - -',Black tries unsuccesfully to establish a final stand at b4. 
187,4,65,4Bc5,b'8/8/3b4/p1B5/P1K1kP2/1P2P3/8/8 b - -',The faithful bishop seeks to deal with black's last piece and so reduce the black position to ashes. 
188,4,66,4Bc7,b'8/2b5/8/p1B5/P1K1kP2/1P2P3/8/8 w - -',The black bishop runs from his adversary.
189,4,67,5Kb5,b'8/2b5/8/pKB5/P3kP2/1P2P3/8/8 b - -',Now the dog and his master are side by side ready to deal with the last bit of black's resistance.
190,4,68,5Bd8,b'3b4/8/8/pKB5/P3kP2/1P2P3/8/8 w - -',The black bishop retreats once again. 
191,4,69,5Bb6,b'3b4/8/1B6/pK6/P3kP2/1P2P3/8/8 b - -',Here it is the Nimzo-Larsen bishop boldly takes a victorious stand. 
192,4,70,5Bxb6,b'8/8/1b6/pK6/P3kP2/1P2P3/8/8 w - -',The black bishop tiredly gives up and accepts his fate.

The development of white's bishop to c4 prepares castling eyes up the f7 pawn and hinders an early d5 by black. This is obviuosly not as popular as its durable neighbour the Ruy Lopez. This is because in most accounts black has a pretty simple route to equality in all directions. However this obviously wasn't realized in the 19th century as it was seen quite often at master level.

Curt von Bardeleben declines the offer to win material by (7...Nxe4) and immediately strikesback in the centre. The struggle now shifts to the battle for the control of d5. A rare alternative to 7...Nxe4 8.O-O when Black may choose between 8...Nxc3 9.bxc3 d5 [9...Bxc3 10.Qb3 has been known to be very good for White since the time of Greco] and the speculative Moller Attack 8...Bxc3 9.d5 now thought to lead to a draw with best play.

262,7,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"Taking a part of the centre.

White now has a choice between either: 
1.  Exchanging the pawns by exd5. 
2.  Advancing the e4 pawn and avoiding exchanges by e5. 
3.  Defending the e4 pawn by a piece by Nc3 or Nd2. "
263,7,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White decides to advance and avoid exchanges.  Note how the central pawns are now all locked up.
264,7,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black is basically luring White into taking his c-pawn.  If White takes the pawn then Black can work to attack the e5 pawn which is because the pawn which was defending e5 is no longer on d4.  Although this seems to lose a pawn for Black Black knows that he can easily win the c-pawn back.  For example 4.dxc5 Qa5  and then 5...Qxc5.
265,7,6,dxc5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White indeed decides to take the c-pawn.  Now Black has a clear plan: to win White's c5 pawn and then pile up pressure on the e5 pawn.  This will hopefully tie White down to defending it and then Black can decide what to do from there. 
266,7,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Instead of going for the c5 pawn straight away Black rightly decides to threaten the e5 pawn because the e5 pawn is more valuable to White than the c5 pawn.  The e5 pawn is more valuable than the c5 pawn because it restricts Black's development more.  The c5 pawn doesn't stop Black from getting his Ng8 or or Bc8 out for example.  However the e5 pawn stops Black from playing Nf6 which is the best square for the knight.
267,7,8,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White logically defends his e-pawn and develops a piece.
268,7,9,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/6b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"Black wants to play e6 and then take the c5 pawn with his Bf8 but he doesn't want to play e6 yet because it would lock in the Bc8 and prevent it from being developed in any active way.  Therefore Black develops his Bc8 first.

5...Bg4 pins the Nf3 to the Qd1 preventing it from moving.  If the Nf3 moves then Black can take White's queen.  So now the knight is tied down to the f3 square and stops it from taking back at e5 if Black plays Nxe5.

Another way of explaining this is that Black's Nc6 attacks e5 but White's Nf3 defends e5.  So Black is attacking e5 once and White is defending it once.  This means that Black can't take e5.  Black needs a superior attacking force to White's defending force.  The Bg4 negates the Nf3's defence of the e5 pawn which means that Black is attacking e5 once and White is defending it 0 times.  So Black is now threatening to take the e5 pawn."
269,7,10,Bf4,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White defends against the threat now he has one defender compared to one attacker.  The e5 pawn is safe.
270,7,11,e6,b'r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2PpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Now Black's light-squared bishop is outside of the f7-e6-d5 pawn chain.  Black is now threatening to play Bxc5 with a superior position due to his more active pieces.
271,7,12,Bb5,b'r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White develops his bishop and frees his pieces defending the e5 pawn a bit because now the Nc6 is pinned.
272,7,13,a6,b'r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/1BPpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black shoos the Bb5 away.  Now White can either take the Nc6 retreat the bishop to a4 (and maintaining the pin) or retreat the bishop to d3 or e2.
273,7,14,Bxc6+,b'r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1B1p3/2PpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White decides to trade bishop for knight.
274,7,15,bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2PpP3/5Bb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black takes back.
275,7,16,Be3,b'r2qkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2PpP3/6b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',"This isn't a good move for a few reasons.

Firstly White is moving the same piece twice in the opening.  He's wasting time when he should be taking out his Nb1 or castling.

Secondly White shouldn't try to defend the c5 pawn.  The e5 pawn is much more important."
276,7,17,Qa5+,b'r3kbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1PpP3/6b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black decides to pick up White's c5 pawn immediately.
277,7,18,1c3,b'r3kbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1PpP3/6b1/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',"Blocking the check and preparing the move pawn to b4.

Black can't actually take the c5 pawn now.  This is because after 10...Bxc5 White can play b4 attacking both Black's queen and bishop.  Black would be forced to retreat his queen and then White can take Black's Bc5 for free."
278,7,19,1Ne7,b'r3kb1r/4nppp/p1p1p3/q1PpP3/6b1/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',So instead Black decides to continue with development.  While the Ne7 seems to be blocking the Bf8 and slowing down development this is not an issue because Black intends to play Nf5 next move.

The resulting pawns on f2 and f3 would be doubled pawns and the f5 square would become particularly weak (because White can no longer play g4) and Black can place his knight on the great f5 square.
282,7,23,1Nf5,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1PpPn2/8/2P1BQ1P/PP3PP1/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Improving the knight's position and allowing the Bf8 to come out.

286,7,27,1Qxe5,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/2Ppqn2/1P6/2P1BQ1P/P4PP1/RN3RK1 w kq -',Picking up the free pawn.  Now material is even but Black has the better position due to the weak White queenside pawns and better pieces.  Note that the Nb1 can't move because the c3 pawn will hang.
287,7,28,1a3,b'r3kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/2Ppqn2/1P6/P1P1BQ1P/5PP1/RN3RK1 b kq -',A poor move.  Strengthening the b4 pawn but the development of White's Nb1 and Ra1 is a more important issue.
288,7,29,1g6,b'r3kb1r/5p1p/p1p1p1p1/2Ppqn2/1P6/P1P1BQ1P/5PP1/RN3RK1 w kq -',Black decides that the Bf8 won't be able to take on c5 anytime soon so he decides to deploy the bishop to g7 where it is more useful than e7.
289,7,30,1Ra2,b'r3kb1r/5p1p/p1p1p1p1/2Ppqn2/1P6/P1P1BQ1P/R4PP1/1N3RK1 b kq -',White tries to get out his Ra1 into the game this way.

White's knight is performing an annoying role of guarding the c3 pawn while Black's knight is centralised and strong on f5.  The Black bishop is also superior to the White bishop.  It watches down a long diagonal down to the c3 pawn while White's bishop just stares at its own pawn on c5.  The Black queen is superior to the White queen because it ties the White knight down to the defense of the c3 pawn.  White's queen can't boast of a similar feat.
291,7,32,1Re2,b'r3k2r/5pbp/p1p1p1p1/2Ppqn2/1P6/P1P1BQ1P/4RPP1/1N3RK1 b kq -',White indirectly attacks Black's queen as if he moves the Be3 somewhere then the Qe5 will be under fire from the Re2.
292,7,33,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/2q2pbp/p1p1p1p1/2Pp1n2/1P6/P1P1BQ1P/4RPP1/1N3RK1 w kq -',Black retreats his queen to a safe square where it can support the a-pawn moving to a5 or the e-pawn moving to e5.

299,7,40,2h4,b'r4rk1/2q2pb1/2p1p1p1/2Pp1n1p/1P5P/P2Q2P1/4RP2/1NB2RK1 b - -',White blocks the h5 pawn from potentially advancing to h4.  Now Black's Nf5 is very hard to kick out because the h3 pawn wouldn't be supporting a possible g4 advance.
300,7,41,2Bd4,b'r4rk1/2q2p2/2p1p1p1/2Pp1n1p/1P1b3P/P2Q2P1/4RP2/1NB2RK1 w - -',Black is trying to setup a little tactic.  Now Black is threatening 23...Nxg3 because the f2 pawn can't take back because it's pinned by the Bd4 and if White takes back with the queen Black plays Qxg3 and gets a free queen as the f2 pawn still can't take back on g3.  If White played Qxd4 after Black's Nxg3 (because the knight is no longer defending the Bd4) then Black can play Nxe2  forcing the White king to move and then capturing the queen on d4 by Nxd4.
301,7,42,2Bf4,b'r4rk1/2q2p2/2p1p1p1/2Pp1n1p/1P1b1B1P/P2Q2P1/4RP2/1N3RK1 b - -',White attacks the Qc7 so Black has no time to play his Nxg3.  But Black has a backup plan.

307,7,48,2Rxe3,b'r4rk1/2q2p2/2p3p1/2Pp1n1p/1P2p2P/PQ2R1P1/5P2/1N3RK1 b - -',White decides against taking back with the f-pawn but this way allows an exchange of the Nf5 for the Re3.  This exchange favours Black because rooks are generally superior to knights in most situations.

This keeps the d4 square occupied and keeps preventing the d4 pawn move by Black.  White didn't play 30.Qxg7 instead because after 30...Kxg7 White wouldn't be able to prevent 31...d4.

319,7,60,3Kf2,b'3r2k1/8/2p3p1/2Pp1p1p/rP1RpP1P/P5P1/5K2/1N6 b - -',White intends to bring his king into the fight which is a good thing to do.  Kings should be tucked away out of the battle during the middlegame but when there's enough pieces off the board for the king to be relatively safe then the king should be used as a fighting piece.
320,7,61,3Kf7,b'3r4/5k2/2p3p1/2Pp1p1p/rP1RpP1P/P5P1/5K2/1N6 w - -',Black does the same.

339,8,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Against Sicilian Baker usually plays c3 or the Morra Gambit (d4 cxd4 c3) but I didn't want to play one of his openings since he would probably crush me due to having more knowledge.
340,8,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move has a lot of purposes. It defends the c5-pawn it opens lines for the bishop to develop it prepares a d5 pawn advance in the future and it also controls the important d5 square.
341,8,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This is Open Sicilian since I am opening up the centre. Most variations are good for Black if White does not reclaim the d4 square.
342,8,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Another playable move is d5 but it is frowned upon by most players since it offers to open up the centre even more while White is ahead in development.
343,8,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',c3 would've transposed into the Morra Gambit and Qxd4 is just dubious since Black gets a free developing move Nc6.
344,8,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The most common continuation for Black is Nf6 and I cannot attack his knight with e5 because of Qa5 
345,8,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Nxc6 just strengthens Black's pawn structure by allowing him to bring a pawn closer to the centre. It's better for me just to develop a piece.
346,8,9,Qc7,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I thought Baker would play Bb4 but I guess he had a more strategic move in mind. Qc7 sets up queenside counterplay later.
347,8,10,Ndb5,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Forcing the queen to move again
348,8,11,Qb8,b'rqb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The purpose of Nc6 was to get the queen to b8 where it will control the b-file after ideas like a6 b5 giving Black good queenside play.
349,8,12,Be3,b'rqb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is usually the best square for the bishop in all Open Sicilians. Although in some variations the bishop goes to g5 depending on how Black plays.
350,8,13,a6,b'rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Baker is initiating his plan to play b5 and gain space on the queenside so I had to think hard about my next move.
351,8,14,Bb6,b'rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/pBn1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',In order to beat Baker you have to think like him. Baker's specialty is sacrificing pawns and/or pieces to gain lots of attacking potential so here I sacrifice a piece to get an attacking initiative.
352,8,15,axb5,b'rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1p6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I was threatening Nc7 
353,8,16,Nxb5,b'rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I'm threatening Nc7  once more.
354,8,17,Bb4+,b'rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/1b2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This move was good since it gives Black an extra move to play Ba5. I was a little disappointed since I was expecting Ra4 where Nc7  Ke7 c4!! intends c5 threatening Qd6  where I have a very strong attack on the weak dark squares for compensation for the piece.
355,8,18,1c3,b'rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/1b2P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I played this instantly since it was clearly the best move.
356,8,19,1Ba5,b'rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/bN6/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I'm still down a piece so trading bishops would be winning for him since I'd no longer have the pressure on c7.
357,8,20,1Nc7+,b'rqb1k1nr/1pNp1ppp/1Bn1p3/b7/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now Black has a choice. He can let me take the rook where I'll still have a strong attack on the dark squares (but he'll have two pieces for the rook) or sacrifice the queen and end up with three extra minor pieces.
358,8,21,1Qxc7,b'r1b1k1nr/1pqp1ppp/1Bn1p3/b7/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Baker isn't the type of player who likes to defend.
359,8,22,1Bxc7,b'r1b1k1nr/1pBp1ppp/2n1p3/b7/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Duh!
360,8,23,1Bxc7,b'r1b1k1nr/1pbp1ppp/2n1p3/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now Black has three minor pieces for the price of his queen and a pawn a roughly even trade although I'm  1 in material count the material is too imbalanced to say who is better here.
361,8,24,1Qg4,b'r1b1k1nr/1pbp1ppp/2n1p3/8/4P1Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Hitting g7.

365,8,28,1Qf3,b'r1b1k2r/1pbpnp1p/2n1p1p1/8/4PP2/2P2Q2/PP4PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I couldn't see any useful moves here so I played Qf3 which prepares g4 and makes f5 less annoying.

368,8,31,1Bd7,b'r3k2r/1pbbnp1p/2n1p1p1/1B1p4/4PP2/2P2Q2/PP4PP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Breaking the pin.

370,8,33,1O-O,b'r4rk1/1pbbnp1p/2n1p1p1/1B1p4/P3PP2/2P2Q2/1P4PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Exactly what I wanted now after I castle queenside it will be a classic Sicilian position where each side goes for a mating attack on opposite sides of the board.
371,8,34,1O-O-O,b'r4rk1/1pbbnp1p/2n1p1p1/1B1p4/P3PP2/2P2Q2/1P4PP/2KR3R b - -',My intended move. Although my king's position is weaker than Black's I have more attacking potential on the kingside with my pawns.
372,8,35,1Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/1pbbnp1p/2n1p1p1/1B1p4/P3PP2/2P2Q2/1P4PP/2KR3R w - -',It seemed awkward that Baker would move a defender away from his king. Maybe better was dxe4 Qxe4 Nd5 where at least Black would free up some space in the centre. But then again Baker knows he's better than me and maybe thought he'd win through my mistakes. So I intended to make accurate moves throughout the rest of the game.
373,8,36,1e5,b'r2r2k1/1pbbnp1p/2n1p1p1/1B1pP3/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4PP/2KR3R b - -',Now Black cannot free up space with dxe4 and I control the weak f6 square. The pawn structure somewhat resembles a French Defense now.
374,8,37,1Bb6,b'r2r2k1/1p1bnp1p/1bn1p1p1/1B1pP3/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4PP/2KR3R w - -',This is another strange move by Baker. I realized that he probably wasn't playing his best and this was my chance to finally beat him in a tournament. Na5 was probably Black's best move.
375,8,38,2h4,b'r2r2k1/1p1bnp1p/1bn1p1p1/1B1pP3/P4P1P/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R b - h3',Now my attack can pick up steam due to a couple of pointless moves by Black.
376,8,39,2Nb8,b'rn1r2k1/1p1bnp1p/1b2p1p1/1B1pP3/P4P1P/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R w - -',Baker's idea to trade pieces to weaken my king's position was good but my kingside attack is too fast.
377,8,40,2h5,b'rn1r2k1/1p1bnp1p/1b2p1p1/1B1pP2P/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R b - -',Had Black tried preventing this with h5 then g4 is a simple way to forcibly open the kingside.
378,8,41,2Bxb5,b'rn1r2k1/1p2np1p/1b2p1p1/1b1pP2P/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R w - -',After axb5 Black has Ra1  Kc2 Rxd1 Rxd1 and my attack is stalled while Black has much more counterplay on the queenside so I had to make a very important decision right now.
379,8,42,2hxg6,b'rn1r2k1/1p2np1p/1b2p1P1/1b1pP3/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R b - -',I ignore the piece and instead continue my attack now leaving Baker with every single one of my minor pieces at the price of only his queen.
380,8,43,2Be8,b'rn1rb1k1/1p2np1p/1b2p1P1/3pP3/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR3R w - -',I was hoping for Bxa4 because I can leave my rook hanging and play Rxh7 since Bxd1 loses to Qh3!! with an incredibly strong attack and threat to play Qh6 which mates. Be8 is a defending move and Black didn't want to waste time taking a pawn.
381,8,44,2Rxh7,b'rn1rb1k1/1p2np1R/1b2p1P1/3pP3/P4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/2KR4 b - -',Even though four minor pieces are almost always superior to a queen and a few pawns Black isn't using his four pieces as attacking forces while my queen has a lot of attacking potential.

Black needs to activate his forces on the queenside to get counterplay.
I think Kf8 was the best move but I still have a strong attack after f5 and Nxe5 is losing because I can leave my queen hanging with f6!! threatening Rh8# so Black must play Ng6 to defend h8 but then I can simply play Rh8  Nxh8 Rxh8#"
385,8,48,2Kb1,b'1n1rb1k1/1p3p1R/1b2p1n1/3pP3/r4P2/2P2Q2/1P4P1/1K5R b - -',This simple defensive move stops Ra1  and Black's king is still helpless since Kf8 f5!! is still strong.

399,9,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The scandinavian defense a nice counterattacking way to meet 1.e4.  I normally play the sicilian so while I play this (the scandinavian) occasionally my understanding of it is far from excellent.
400,9,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2... Qxd5 is a perfectly reasonable alternative but I hugely prefer this move it prepares a bunch of gambits from the one in this game (the portuguese) to the icelandic with 2... Nf6 3.c4 e6.  Also it plans to retake on d5 with the knight instead of the queen.  There is a maxim about not bringing out your queen in the opening this move follows that idea as 2... Qxd5 loses tempo to 3.Nc3.
401,9,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White doesn't hold onto material with 3.c4 he's willing to give it back to erect a strong center via 3... Nxd5 4.c4.
402,9,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This initiates the portuguese gambit black develops with tempo.  If white blocks with a piece black will regain the pawn and have a slight development lead to counteract white's good center an approximately equal (and usually dull) game.  If white wants to play ambitiously he's forced to play the following weakening move.

408,9,10,1e6,b'3qkb1r/2pn1ppp/r3p3/3n1b2/B2P4/5P2/PP2N1PP/RNBQK2R w KQk -',Black prepares to conclude development.  I think it's time to take a step back and give the position a look.  I have an obvious development advantage and a target in the IQP (isolated queen's pawn) as well as having instigated the weakening f3 from white.  I also have two open files in the a & b files.  White has an excellent bishop on a4 that pins down black's knight and thus my queen (in order to defend the knight).  I need to use my advantage in time effectively this means I should play pressuring moves but it also means I should NOT trade.  I've spent a lot of time developing my pieces and if I trade one for a piece white has just developed it'll be a loss of time.  My plan is to castle quick and attack white's game.  His plan is to trade his undeveloped pieces for my strong ones.  However he shouldn't trade his bishop for my knight on d7 yet as it pins me down.

And where else will my bishop go?  On e7 it's fine but a little passive and on d6 it's a target of eventual moves like Ne4.

So I think it's time for another look at the board.  I'm targeting the a pawn and white is tied down to it.  He also has to worry about the weakness of the IQP.  An IQP is usually helpful if you can use it in an attack but that's unlikely here so it's a target for me.  The pawn on f3 is still a problem for white as it opens an annoying diagonal against his king.  In an open game I also have the advantage of still having a bishop on an open board.  This is my compensation for being down a pawn is it worth it?  I don't know.  I think it's interesting though that I've had compensation for the pawn from move 3 until now.
419,9,21,1d5,b'3qk2r/3nbppp/r3p3/3P4/8/PQN2P2/4N1PP/R4RK1 b k -',A VERY double-edged move.  White tries to rid himself of a weakness and open the e file.  On the other hand it opens up the a7-g1 diagonal for me.  It also opens the a1-h8 diagonal.  It trades off a weakness but in return weakens the dark squares.
420,9,22,2Nf4,b'3q1rk1/3nbppp/4r3/8/5N2/PQN2P2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',White's trying to activate but the position is an open one where his knights will become targets.
421,9,23,2Nc5,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4r3/2n5/5N2/PQN2P2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',Instead of passively defending I counterattack his queen while threatening Qd4 .  However this a blunder and I should now lose the game.  Instead I should probably play the pressure Re3.
422,9,24,2Qd5,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4r3/2nQ4/5N2/P1N2P2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',He misses the win!  After 22.Nxe6 Nxb3 23.Nxd8 Nxa1 24.Nc6! Bf6 25.Ne4! and white will trade off black's bishop going into a pawn up endgame which should be a reasonably straight forward win.  This move is one from the green eyed monster school of thought.  The white queen which has been on a side that's been constantly pressured grows jealous of my queen.  She's willing to give herself up to end my queen's life... Aside from bad lines about green eyed monsters this move makes sense as white still wants to trade.  The one problem is 22.Nxe6 wins.
423,9,25,2Ra6,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/r7/2nQ4/5N2/P1N2P2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',White removes his rook from the attacked square and it pressures white's biggest advantage (the outside extra pawns) and biggest weakness (it's an isolated pawn on the line of my bishop).
424,9,26,2Nfd5,b'3r2k1/4bppp/r7/2nN4/8/P1N2P2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',White continues playing for trades.
425,9,27,2Bd6,b'3r2k1/5ppp/r2b4/2nN4/8/P1N2P2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',...and I continue avoiding them as much as I can.
426,9,28,2Rfd1,b'3r2k1/5ppp/r2b4/2nN4/8/P1N2P2/6PP/R2R2K1 b - -',This move places a rook on an important file but I think the trappy 25.Nb5!? may be better.  Afterwords my oppones said he looked at it but thought it was bad after 25... Bxh2 !? 26.Kxh2 Rxd5 however he's got a nice move at the end: 27.Nc7! forking rooks.  While black's not forced to play the bishop check I think it's a nice trap to toss out and I could see myself falling for it.
427,9,29,2Ne6,b'3r2k1/5ppp/r2bn3/3N4/8/P1N2P2/6PP/R2R2K1 w - -',I add pressure to a3.
428,9,30,2Ne4,b'3r2k1/5ppp/r2bn3/3N4/4N3/P4P2/6PP/R2R2K1 b - -',26.Nb5 was better and made more sense as it also attacks the bishop and defends a3.  However white has had to worry about little annoying threats the entire game and here he begins to throw it away.
429,9,31,2Ne7+,b'3r2k1/4Nppp/r3n3/8/4N3/b4P2/6PP/R2R2K1 b - -',"This traps was his plan with 26.Ne4... Too bad it's weak.  He want's 27... Bxe7 28.Rxd8  Bxd8 29.Rxa6 but I'm not going to fall for that.

thanks to neilskye for pointing out that I initially wrote that 27... Bxe7 is met by 28.Rxa6?? which (he pointed out) is met by 28... Rxd1  winning."
430,9,32,2Kf8,b'3r1k2/4Nppp/r3n3/8/4N3/b4P2/6PP/R2R2K1 w - -',Now white has only one move to hold the position together namely 28.Nd5 where I'm better due to the bishop but it's nothing close to a win.
431,9,33,2Rxd8+,b'3R1k2/4Nppp/r3n3/8/4N3/b4P2/6PP/R5K1 b - -',The losing blunder now white has to worry about two threats.  One is the hanging knight and the other is Bc5  winning the rook on a1.  Notice that the weakness instigated on move 3 has lasted throughout the entire game and allows for this final tactic.
432,9,34,Ra5,b'3n1k2/5ppp/8/r1N2N2/8/5P2/5KPP/8 w - -',The final point white might be able to hold the endgame if he's only down an exchange and with knights there are so many forks to worry about that it would have been difficult to prove if it was not for this skewer.
433,9,35,3Nd7+,b'3n1k2/3N1ppp/8/r4N2/8/5P2/5KPP/8 b - -',White's prays for 32... Kg8 where he'll have time to retreat the attacked knight on f5.
434,9,36,3Ke8,b'3nk3/3N1ppp/8/r4N2/8/5P2/5KPP/8 w - -',But no.  There is a double attack on the knights and black wins.  While I can't claim that this game was the most accurate it shows the way CONSTANT pressure and easy development comes in the portuguese gambit.  This isn't a crushing attack like game #1 in this game white doesn't grab material at every opportunity the game shows another part of the opening the constand build-up of threats that can last an entire game.  I hope you enjoyed the game and please PM me with comments criticisms and analysis.

Actually taking the Bishop was probably better it would give back a bit of material to halt White's attack. exf5 19. Nxa8 Nc4 (to stop Nb6) 20. b3 Ne5 21. Nb6 and the bishop will fall but the pawn looks strong for now.

591,15,3,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As you will see over the next few moves simple development with Be2 and kingside castling will lead to a quieter game with a lot of maneuvering. This is my preference. I have however used the sharp Van der Wiel Variation 4.Nc3 e6 5. g4! which leads to exciting play on a few occasions mostly as a surprise weapon in OTB chess.
592,15,4,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Still in the main lines. This move covers the c5 square and places pressure on the e5 square as well. The battle for the centre is underway.
593,15,5,h6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I feel this pre-emptive move is too quiet and loses a tempo. Blacks pieces are already congested and a more sharper alternative would be my choice. 7....Bg4 is a possibility or alternatively 7....Ng6 which would be my preference freeing the black diagonal bishop. If white opts for h3 then Nh4.
594,15,6,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',8. Re1 is a natural alternative but this move with 8.Be3 reinforces the centre pawns preparing against the inevitable ....c4 assault. In addition it is a good developing move. The rooks are only one move away from being connected!
595,15,7,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I feel this move weakens the pawn structure unnecessarily and does nothing to place pressure on Whites control of the centre. In addition it has created a target for white on the b6 square with that backward pawn. 8....Q-c7 would be more active. The advance to a6 should only be used if forced. Otherwise a7 is the best position for it.
596,15,8,a3,b'r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This is what may be called a 'Prophylaxis' move. ie. Taking preventative measures in anticipation of an opponents move. This move is already laying the groundwork for a Queenside attack.
597,15,9,c5,b'r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p3p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I feel this move was premature there is not enough artillery present to make this effective. 9....Qc7 could still have been utilized. Obviously Black wanted to use this as an attacking move as well as a freeing move for his Knight and black diagonal bishop but I feel it could have waited.
598,15,10,1dxc5,b'r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p3p2p/2PpPb2/8/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',No hesitation required in accepting the pawn.
599,15,11,1Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/8/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',A perfunctory glance shows Black has now opened some lines and alleviated the congestion. However Black has failed to see that the b6 square has been Whites target since 8....a6. 
600,15,12,1Na4,b'r2qkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Now Knight to a4! This move protects the valuable c5 pawn as well as threatening Nb6.
601,15,13,1Qb8,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I feel Qc7 would be a better move. Keeping the Queen guarding the a5-d8 diagonal is arguably a better alternative. In addition the 'a' file rook would still remain active. This move loses another tempo for black because this is not the ideal placement for the queen. The Queen will have to move again.
602,15,14,1Qd2,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',White could have moved 12.b4 now. But  d2 gets the Queen active as well as opening a path for both whites rooks to get involved at a later date. They are now connected. There is no rush White has developed comfortably and there are no immediate threats.
603,15,15,1Ncxe5,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppnb2/N7/P3BN2/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',I feel the following moves for black were in the wrong sequence. These subtle differences accumulate to small advantages for white. This is an obvious choice in one respect. But was the e5 pawn really going anywhere? White already knows this pawn this pawn is lost. The knight move to a4 confirms Whites intentions on keeping the c5 pawn instead. I feel Black could have delayed this move and alternatively moved 12....Be7 leaving the King the option of castling and activating the h file rook if required.
604,15,16,1Nd4,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppnb2/N2N4/P3B3/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',No hesitation here. Placing a direct threat on the bishop whilst developing the Knight.
605,15,17,1Be4,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppn3/N2Nb3/P3B3/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',This is a wasted move I feel. White was planning to activate this pawn regardless. The bishop should have retreated h7 immediately. Another tempo lost for Black.
606,15,18,1b4,b'rq2kb1r/1p1n1ppb/p3p2p/2Ppn3/NP1N4/P3BP2/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 b kq b3',Now b4! White has claimed a lot of space and developed well. 
607,15,19,1Qd8,b'r2qkb1r/1p1n1ppb/p3p2p/2Ppn3/NP1N4/P3BP2/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',This is the 2nd time the Queen has shifted in 4 moves? I still feel the c7 square is a better placement for the Queen. 
608,15,20,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1n1ppb/p1n1p2p/2Pp4/NP1N1P2/P3B3/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',The only square really. Blacks Queenside is certainly a little light regarding defenders and travelling to the Kingside would certainly be worse. Note how all Whites pieces are active even in latent form. In addition both rooks can travel on any of the a to f files if required. 
609,15,21,1Nxc6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1n1ppb/p1N1p2p/2Pp4/NP3P2/P3B3/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 b kq -',Qc7 on move 15 may could have prevented the further weakening of the b file by giving the option the Queen retaking. Now the  bxc6 is forced. 
610,15,22,1bxc6,b'r2qkb1r/3n1ppb/p1p1p2p/2Pp4/NP3P2/P3B3/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',I considered 18.Nb6 but strengthening the centre placing support to the control of the e5 square and limiting the possible activation of the bishop via g6 was a better alternative at this stage. So the next move is Bd4!  
611,15,23,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/5ppb/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/NP1B1P2/P7/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Be7 is an interesting alternative. For example 18....Be7 19. Bxg7 Rg8 20.Bd4 Be4! with some counterplay for the sacrifice. In addition 20....Bf6 is alternative. Black gains an open g file for the pawn and an opportunity to swap Whites dangerous black diagonal bishop. Obviously declining the offered pawn leads to different lines but Black is no worse off regardless. And still gets gets his bishop active and a chance to castle if White declines the offer.
612,15,24,1Bd3,b'r2qkb1r/5ppb/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/NP1B1P2/P2B4/2PQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',c4 is still a waiting move for white. Blacks white diagonal bishop could cause problems later and best to swap it off now. Controlling the the b1-h7 diagonal would limit whites rook to the b file placement if needed. And anyway why give black any possible bullets? Blacks black diagonal bishop is going nowhere. Best keep him congested for as long as possible and eradicate the one that is free.
613,15,25,2Qxd3,b'r2qkb1r/5pp1/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/NP1B1P2/P2Q4/2P3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',The obvious choice. The c2 pawn will be needed for c5 at a later date to crack open black centre pawn formation.
614,15,26,2Be7,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/NP1B1P2/P2Q4/2P3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',The best for Black at this stage. 
615,15,27,2Nb6,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/pNp1pn1p/2Pp4/1P1B1P2/P2Q4/2P3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',F5 is a tempting move but after 21....0-0 Blacks King escapes. Keeping the pressure on by forcing Black to move his rook is a better alternative I feel. In addition the placement of the knight here cramps Black position further. It controls a lot of squares including the all important c5 when the time is right.
616,15,28,2Ra7,b'3qk2r/r3bpp1/pNp1pn1p/2Pp4/1P1B1P2/P2Q4/2P3PP/R4RK1 w k -',The best choice.
617,15,29,2f5,b'3qk2r/r3bpp1/pNp1pn1p/2Pp1P2/1P1B4/P2Q4/2P3PP/R4RK1 b k -',Now f5! The next sequence of moves are forced.
618,15,30,O-O,b'3q1rk1/r3bpp1/pNp2n1p/2Pp1Q2/1P1B4/P7/2P3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Finally Blacks King finds safety.
619,15,31,2Rad1,b'3q1rk1/r3bpp1/pNp2n1p/2Pp1Q2/1P1B4/P7/2P3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',The d file placement is important. The threat of a pin against Blacks Queen is real after c5. In addition there is latent  pressure against the d5 pawn. This will come to fruition after white begins to advance abc file pawns.
620,15,32,2Nd7,b'3q1rk1/r2nbpp1/pNp4p/2Pp1Q2/1P1B4/P7/2P3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',There is no doubt Black is in trouble. May-be Black was hoping White would swap knights. No chance of that the knight is very strong on b6. May-be Qb8 would have been a stronger defence. 24....Qb8 25. Bxf6Bxf6 26.Nd7Rxd7 27.Qxd7 leaving Black with a better chance of defence. The Black diagonal bishop would be a strong defender. Alternatively if White opted for an immediate 25.c4 then dxc4 Nxc4 leaves Black better as well. I think Black needed to think more laterally here.
621,15,33,2c4,b'3q1rk1/r2nbpp1/pNp4p/2Pp1Q2/1PPB4/P7/6PP/3R1RK1 b - c3',Finally the best time to advance this pawn. The groundwork had been prepared.
622,15,34,2Nxb6,b'3q1rk1/r3bpp1/pnp4p/2Pp1Q2/1PPB4/P7/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Getting rid of that pesky knight was pressing
623,15,35,Rd7,b'3q1rk1/3rbpp1/pPp4p/3p1Q2/1PPB4/P7/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',The logical placement.
624,15,36,2c5,b'3q1rk1/3rbpp1/pPp4p/2Pp1Q2/1P1B4/P7/6PP/3R1RK1 b - -',c5! The best. Closes any counterplay by Black on the Queenside. The b6 pawn is strong. Usually when a pawn reaches the 6th rank it is very strong. If it gets to the 7th then its usually a winning game. Black will have its resources tied down to the defence of the b7 square. White can continue its attack.
625,15,37,2Bg5,b'3q1rk1/3r1pp1/pPp4p/2Pp1Qb1/1P1B4/P7/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black needs to open a file and the 'e file' is the only one available.
626,15,38,2a4,b'3q1rk1/3r1pp1/pPp4p/2Pp1Qb1/PP1B4/8/6PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White will continue its assault on the Queenside hoping to link two pass pawns.
627,15,39,2Re8,b'3qr1k1/3r1pp1/pPp4p/2Pp1Qb1/PP1B4/8/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Or 28....e7. Dosn't matter. It is now a waiting game for Black no choice. White is continuing Queenside push.
628,15,40,axb5,b'3qr1k1/3r1pp1/1Pp4p/1pPp1Qb1/P2B4/8/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',This is best of a bad bunch.
629,15,41,3axb5,b'3qr1k1/3r1pp1/1Pp4p/1PPp1Qb1/3B4/8/6PP/3R1RK1 b - -',What about Re6 followed by Rg6? Getting the rook off the back rank being maybe a stronger defence. Next move g6? prevents the rook from using that square.
630,15,42,3Qd3,b'3qr1k1/3r1p2/1Pp3pp/1PPp2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/3R1RK1 b - -',A nice central position for the Queen.
631,15,43,3Re6,b'3q2k1/3r1p2/1Pp1r1pp/1PPp2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',I feel Qc8 may have been better now that the g6 square is unavailable freeing up d8 for the bishop if required. 
632,15,44,3Rde1,b'3q2k1/3r1p2/1Pp1r1pp/1PPp2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/4RRK1 b - -',The obvious choice.
633,15,45,3Rxe1,b'3q2k1/3r1p2/1Pp3pp/1PPp2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/4rRK1 w - -',Pretty much forced.
634,15,46,cxb5,b'3q2k1/3r1p2/1P4pp/1pPp2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',Now white has finally achieved his strategy of getting linked passed pawns!  
635,15,47,Re7,b'3q2k1/4rp2/1PP3pp/1p1p2b1/3B4/3Q4/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',Only a matter of time now. 
636,15,48,3g3,b'6k1/4qp2/1PP3pp/1p1p2b1/3B4/3Q2P1/7P/6K1 b - -',This move was important in opening up an escape route for the King as well as preventing Bf4.
637,15,49,3Bf6,b'6k1/4qp2/1PP2bpp/1p1p4/3B4/3Q2P1/7P/6K1 w - -',What else has Black got?
638,15,50,3b7,b'6k1/1P3p2/2P2qpp/1p1p4/8/3Q2P1/7P/6K1 b - -',Not that it matters too much but Qe5 is a stronger defence in a losing position.
639,15,51,Qb2+,b'6k1/1P3p2/2P3pp/1p1p4/8/3Q2P1/1q3K1P/8 w - -',Again Black should have taken the opportunity of Qe5 instead.
640,15,52,Qd4+,b'6k1/1P3p2/2P3pp/1p1p4/3q4/6P1/4QK1P/8 w - -',Qf6 would have delayed the inevitable  a little longer.

I felt Black played too passively. Black allowed White to develop comfortably without ever really putting the question to him. White managed to utilize the advantages of force quite effectively. White had control of territoryspacearea etc. Black did not effectively contest these important advantages. In addition the erection of a superior pawn formation by White snuffed out any counterplay. Playing the Caro-Kann defence requires patience. But development is the key. Black must not fall into the trap having a purely defensive mindset.The pawn formation in the 'Advance Variation' gives White an advantage in space. But the draw back for this is that the centre can be undermined by say ...f6 and ...c5. White obviously has better freedom and co-ordination of minor pieces in this variation but cannot directly attack. So this where careful placement of pieces is required by Black and development paramount! Blacks best chances lay in a Queenside attack and it must actively seek to create some weakness in the Queenside pawn structure then bring in as many pieces as possible into attack. I feel an annotated game should be simply explained whilst conveying the basic strategic and tactical concepts. I have always been adverse to complicated analysis involving multiple lines running many moves. For what end? A game that is simply explained showing the process involved in the win/defeat is much better for those trying to grasp the concept of strategy. I hope this game assists those up and coming players and also gives some amusement to those more experienced ones. "

""Adolf Anderssen was one of the strongest players of his time and was considered by many to be the world champion after winning the 1851 London tournament.  Lionel Kieseritzky lived in France much of his life where he gave chess lessons and played games for five francs an hour at the Café de la Regence in Paris.  Kieseritzky was well known for being able to beat lesser players despite handicapping himself - by playing without his queen for example.

The immortal game was an informal one played between these two great players at the Simpson's-in-the-Strand Divan in London.  Kieseritzky was very impressed when the game was over and telegraphed the moves of the game to his Parisian chess club.  The French chess magazine La Regence published the game in July 1851.  This game was later nicknamed ""The Immortal Game"" in 1855 by the Austrian Ernst Falkbeer.

This game is acclaimed as an excellent demonstration of the style of chess play in the 1800s where rapid development and attack were considered the most effective way to win where many gambits and counter-gambits were offered (and not accepting them would be considered slightly ungentlemanly) and where material was often held in contempt.  These games with their rapid attacks and counter-attacks are often entertaining to review even if some of the moves would no longer be considered the best by today's standards.""-Wikipedia.

The King's Gambit is now rarely seen at the master level. However it was popularized by Fischer Spassky and Bromstien.

It may also be worth noting the nature of Black's material gain (the h3 wing pawn) - many modern authorities quite rightly consider wing pawns to be rather worthless in the middlegame and some go as far as to claim that their owner would prefer them off the board to activate his rooks.

979,29,11,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/3P1N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Simple development. The main issue at hand here for black is the development of the Ng8 and the Bf8 as the white pawn on e5 is very restricting.
980,29,12,c3,b'r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! Again I felt this move was a little slow. White does open up a route for his queen (is Qa4 on the horizon?) and overprotects d4 but conversely he loses a potential home for his Nb1. I really expected a developing move or g4 here.
981,29,13,Nge7,b'r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Being given some tempo black attempts to solve the problem of developing this knight. While slow and retreating Nc8 can now be played if needed.
982,29,14,Be2,b'r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP2B1P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Developing and preparing 0-0.

991,29,23,1dxc3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1p2p/2pnPb2/4NP2/2pP1N1P/PP1BB1P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',At this point I felt that I had some tempo at my disposal so I opted to force my opponent to react. As tactical complications are most definitely NOT my forte I attempt to stay in the drivers seat and simplify things a bit. I'm hoping he will re-take with his Bd2 where I can play NxB and have the bishop pair.
992,29,24,1bxc3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1p2p/2pnPb2/4NP2/2PP1N1P/P2BB1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',! Obviously my opponent sees this and reinforces his center while keeping his dark squared bishop in play.

1000,29,32,1Rfd1,b'r2q1rk1/2n1bpp1/p1n1p2p/1pp1P3/P3PP2/2P2N1P/2QBB1P1/R2R2K1 b - -',Rook to open file which threatens a discovered attack on the black queen.

1002,29,34,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/2n1bpp1/p1n1p2p/1p2P3/P1p1PP2/2P1BN1P/2Q1B1P1/R2R2K1 b - -',! Whites gets his dark squared bishop to it's most active diagonal forces the black queen to vacate the d file and threatens a strong 19. Bb6 which can be protected by 20. a5. Strong move!
1003,29,35,1Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/2n1bpp1/p1n1p2p/1p2P3/P1p1PP2/2P1BN1P/2Q1B1P1/R2R2K1 w - -',The best alternative I felt. There were not many better choices.

1005,29,37,1Rd8,b'r1qr2k1/2n1bpp1/p1n1p2p/Pp2P3/2p1PP2/2P1BN1P/2Q1B1P1/R2R2K1 w - -',Fighting to re-take the d file and still trying to simplify.

1007,29,39,2Nxd4,b'r1qr2k1/2n1bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pnPP2/2P1B2P/2Q1B1P1/R2R2K1 w - -',"Fairly obvious if the ""flow"" of this game is understood. Black continues to trade down."

1009,29,41,2Rb8,b'1rqr2k1/2n1bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pPPP2/4B2P/2Q1B1P1/R2R2K1 w - -',Supporting the passer.

1011,29,43,2Qb7,b'1r1r2k1/1qn1bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pPPPB1/4B2P/2Q3P1/R2R2K1 w - -',Doubling support on the b pawn and hitting the enemy on e4.

1013,29,45,2Ne8,b'1r1rn1k1/1q2bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pPPPB1/7P/2Q2BP1/R2R2K1 w - -',As this knight is not accomplishing much it is simply sent to the sidelines to open up the c file for some rook support.
1014,29,46,2Rde1,b'1r1rn1k1/1q2bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pPPPB1/7P/2Q2BP1/R3R1K1 b - -',? I thought this an outright blunder. 24. Be1 was much stronger.
1015,29,47,2Qc7,b'1r1rn1k1/2q1bpp1/p3p2p/Pp2P3/2pPPPB1/7P/2Q2BP1/R3R1K1 w - -',? 24...Rdc8 was better.

1017,29,49,2b4,b'1r1rn1k1/2q1bpp1/p3p2p/P3P3/1ppPPPB1/2Q4P/5BP1/R3R1K1 w - -',*beep beep* Out of the way lady!

1036,30,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"This is a game I played recently OTB. The opponent is a young 2nd category player on the rise. 

I decided to put the game on Gameknot because it has some interesting moments and can be somewhat educational. I will focus on my thinking during the game and not necessarily on computer analysis for ""absolutely best moves"". 

First move is actually transpositional as I play e6 very often as Black. I wanted to see how he will react hopefully with 1...e5 so I can play the reversed Sicilian with extra move."
1037,30,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Pretty good reply straightforward occupation of centre.
1038,30,2,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',With this move I am showing my intent to play 1.b3 system where e3 is a natural part of White's development.
1039,30,3,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black decides to counter in the same manner. This is on the surface not entirely natural due to closed diagonal (d5 is played) but it is hard to stop d5 from moving forward later with tactical possibilities. The only good way is with d4 by White which means that both Bishops will be closed behind their pawns.
1040,30,4,f4,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp1pppp/1p6/3p4/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq f3',Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.
1041,30,5,c5,b'rn1qkbnr/pb2pppp/1p6/2pp4/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq c6',Black improves control of center and is not afraid of Bb5  due to sufficient defensive forces. Game is equal.
1042,30,6,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1b1npppp/pp3n2/1BppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so. Beginners sometimes make that capture unprovoked but it is a loss of tempi - it is better to wait until Black has spent a move forcing the exchange.
1043,30,7,Bxd7+,b'r2qkb1r/1b1Bpppp/pp3n2/2ppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',8.Bc6 is also possible but I decided to play normally and just take the Knight.
1044,30,8,O-O,b'r2qkb1r/1b1npppp/pp6/2ppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I decided that there is no need to waste a tempi on Nd7. At this point I was just playing quickly and without much care which almost backfired!
1045,30,9,Nxe5,b'r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2ppn3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black wants to simplify the position and is preparing a nice trap which unfortunately does not entirely work.
1046,30,10,1Bxe5,b'r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2ppB3/5P2/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I wanted to keep the diagonal open. 10.fe5 is safer and better.
1047,30,11,1d4,b'r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2p1B3/3p1P2/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Very good shot! Now the Bishop is trapped and it looks like it will be captured.

1049,30,13,1Qd5,b'r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2pqBP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',And here comes the main point. Double threat of Qe5 and Qg2# seems unstoppable.
1050,30,14,1Qf3,b'r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2pqBP2/3p4/1P2PQ2/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 b kq -',The only move and a good counterpoint. Now best is 12... Qf3; 13.gf3 with approximate equality (Black for preference though). 12...0-0-0 is another good option. 
1051,30,15,1Qxe5,b'r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2PQ2/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 w kq -',?! Unfortunately Black did not want to exchange Queens and captured the Bishop instead as he originally intended. After this White is better due to better development (already castled). 
1052,30,16,1Qxb7,b'r3kb1r/1Q2pppp/pp6/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Black threat of d:e3 is only optical because Ra8 is hanging.

1055,30,19,1Na3,b'1r1k1b1r/4pppp/ppQ5/2p1qP2/3p4/NP2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Very good move. Ra1 is now defended and the Knight will go to c4 and then either b6 or e5 (-> f3).
1056,30,20,1Qc7,b'1r1k1b1r/2q1pppp/ppQ5/2p2P2/3p4/NP2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Now it is too late. There is no way to force exchange of Queens and Black has to be extremely careful not to allow any opening of the position or he will be mated soon. 15...de3; 16.de3Qe3 ; 17.Kh1 is suicidal due to the opening of d file.
1057,30,21,1Qd5+,b'1r1k1b1r/2q1pppp/pp6/2pQ1P2/3p4/NP2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',This check is not meant to really threaten the f7 pawn but to keep the action tempi in White hands.
1058,30,22,1Nc4,b'1r2kb1r/2q1pppp/pp6/2pQ1P2/2Np4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Knight is entering the game. The pressure on Black position is now developing slowly but surely and safely.
1059,30,23,1Rd8,b'3rkb1r/2q1pppp/pp6/2pQ1P2/2Np4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black has to get rid of Qd5 before White can play Ne5 with threats on f7.
1060,30,24,1Qe4,b'3rkb1r/2q1pppp/pp6/2p2P2/2NpQ3/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',The best move. Queen is very powerful here and can not be easily forced to move away. White keeps his positional advantage and forces Black to find a plan for development.
1061,30,25,1g6,b'3rkb1r/2q1pp1p/pp4p1/2p2P2/2NpQ3/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Nice try. If 19.fg6 hg6 then Rh8 is suddenly an active piece with threats on h2! 18...b5 is an option when White will play 19.Ne5 and later maybe Nf3 to put pressure on d4.
1062,30,26,1a4,b'3rkb1r/2q1pp1p/pp4p1/2p2P2/P1NpQ3/1P2P3/2PP2PP/R4RK1 b - a3',Excellent positional move probably the best move of the game. The point is that sooner or later Black will probably get fed up with Nc4 and play b5. In this case the a file will be of great use to White whose Rooks are better positioned to take advantage from it. From experience I knew that a file can be useful not only positionally but also tactically (with Black King in the centre).

The f file is opening too though so Black needs to keep an eye on f7. If 19...Bg7? then 20.f6! Bf8 (20...Bh6? 21.Nb6); 21.fe7 Be7; 22. Rf6! with advantage for White.

However Black is lacking in active counterplay and has an unpleasant position which needs to be defended with great care - a situation where a lot of patience is needed.
1067,30,31,2b5,b'3rk1r1/2q2pbp/p3p3/1pp5/P1NpP3/1P3Q2/2PP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',? Black shows no patience :I he is using up his only active positional resource - but this is the last straw and his position will soon collapse. It is useful to remember a rule here: In passive position a player should not try to play active - it will only help his opponent.
1068,30,32,2Na3,b'3rk1r1/2q2pbp/4p3/1pp5/3pP3/NP3Q2/2PP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Now there is no defence against 26.Nb5 with threat of 27.Ra7 with great pressure on f7.
1069,30,33,2Rb8,b'1r2k1r1/2q2pbp/4p3/1pp5/3pP3/NP3Q2/2PP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',?? Black missed the next tactical shot. Relatively best is 25...Rf8; 26.Nb5 Qb8; 27.Qg4 (threatens Bg7) Be5; 28.Ra7! with big advantage for White for example 28...Bh2 ?; 29.Kh1 Rd7; 30.Rff7! Rf7; 31.Qg8

1072,30,36,2Ra8+,b'R3k1r1/2q2pbp/4p3/1rp5/3pP3/1P3Q2/2PP2PP/5RK1 b - -',"After this Black resigned. There is no hope left.

What are (I hope) the learning points here? 

1. White achieved nothing in the opening which can be expected from a quiet positional system like 1.b3
2. After short tactical sequence Black overstepped the risk limit when he allowed White to penetrate into his position.
3. White secured a lasting advantage and kept it SAFELY always trying to keep the ""action tempi"" for himself.
4. Move 19.a4 is useful but not only that - it is positionally and tactically far-sighted and counts on the psychological factors.
5. Left without any active counterplay Black self-destructed quickly.

1074,31,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is one of the more common lines of the QGD.  In this situation it leads to some enormously sharp and explosive positions which is a little uncommon.

1077,31,4,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1pp2pp1/p1nbpn1p/3p4/2PP4/1PNBPN2/PB2QPPP/2KR3R w - -',Preparing the e-pawn push trying to blow apart the center and regain control from White's superior position there.

1083,31,10,Qd6,b'r1b1r1k1/1pp2pp1/p1nq1n2/2b3R1/2Pp4/1P1BPN1P/PB2QP2/2KN3R w - -',Simultaneously protecting the bishop and activating the queen for possible counterplay.

1085,31,12,1Nh4,b'r1b1r1k1/1pp2p2/p1nq1np1/2b3R1/2Pp3N/1P1BP2P/PB2QP2/2KN2R1 b - -',Preparing a night sacrifice in order to get at the king.

1087,31,14,2Qf3,b'r1b1rk2/1pp2p2/p1nq1np1/2b3R1/2Pp3N/1P1BPQ1P/PB3P2/2KN2R1 b - -',This was a move that I spent a lot of time looking at.  I couldn't find a mate after sacrificing either the night bishop or rook on f6 because Black's knight always seemed to be able to mount a last-ditch defense.  Thus I tried to get a little extra force into the attack.  However this almost proved to be disastrous.
1088,31,15,2dxe3,b'r1b1rk2/1pp2p2/p1nq1np1/2b3R1/2P4N/1P1BpQ1P/PB3P2/2KN2R1 w - -',Recapturing is dangerous because it allows the e8 rook back into activity which could lead to dangerous counterattacks from black.
1089,31,16,e2,b'r1b1rk2/1pp2p2/p1nq1nB1/2b3R1/2P4N/1P3Q1P/PB2pP2/2KN2R1 w - -',This move was unexpected and nearly finished me off.  There were no easy defenses which made this position almost unsalvagable but luckily...
1090,31,17,2Rd5,b'r1b1rk2/1pp2p2/p1nq1nB1/2bR4/2P4N/1P3Q1P/PB2pP2/2KN2R1 b - -',...the attacking rook was able to be utilized at the perfect time for defense of White's slightly overexposed king.

1095,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game is the first in a series of games which (attempt to) show some of the fun involved in the portuguese gambit.  Black sacrifices a pawn but in return gets a nice developmental edge gives white doubled pawns (admittedly on the d file so there not so bad) and white gets a VERY weak pawn on f3.  This is not a very deep game but it's always enjoyable to see games where 6/16 moves are made with white's king.
1096,32,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',In the portuguese black lets the pawn be.  He's prepared to meet 3.c4 with a gambit like 3... c6 or 3... e6 (the Icelandic gambit).  Either way he will soon have two pieces out when white has zero.  The (more popular) alternative to 2... Nf6 is the simple queen recapture with 2... Qxd5.
1097,32,2,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White decides not to hold onto the pawn he'll get a space advantage after 3... Nxd5 4.c4 and after 3... Qxd5 4.Nc3 we've transposed back into lines with 2... Qxd5.
1098,32,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This initiates the portuguese gambit.  Black will regain the pawn in some lines but he gives white the chance to be greedy.
1099,32,4,f3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White is a greedy patzer.  However he has little choice.  3.Nf3 Qxd5 and it's difficult to show that white has an advantage (black's development is very good) and after 3.Be2 Bxe2 4.Qxe2 (4.Nxe2 is an equally good alternative) 4... Qxd5 5.Nf3 black should once again be perfectly fine.  The point is white is forced to either play greedily or black gets an easy game.
1100,32,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black induces weakness and then retreats to a different but no less active square.
1101,32,6,c4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',White MUST hold the pawn (otherwise there was no reason to create the weakness that 4.f3 created.  But this is the wrong way 5.Bb5  followed by c4 brings the bishop into the game with tempo while pinning black's game down a little.
1102,32,7,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P1b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black needs to find a way to bring the rest of his pieces into the game c6 is the natural square for his knight but for the moment white's pawn guards it.  He also needs to activate his dark squared bishop.  This move achieves both goals quite cleverly.
1103,32,8,dxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/5b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Once again white accepts material.  And once again it's probably his only hope for anything.  Otherwise black will simply win back d5 and be at least equal.
1104,32,9,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1Pn2/5b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black didn't plan to take back he just wanted a square to develop his knight to.
1105,32,10,exf7+,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2Ppp/2n2n2/5b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This time the materialistic plan is silly.  It looks intriguing to grab the pawn and draw black's king out to f7.  Normally f7 is a great square to attack.  But notice that there's none of the natural checks via Qb3  Qh5  Bc4  or Nf3-g5 .  But white is just falling into black's plan.  I should note that 7.d5 is stronger but black is still active after 7... Nb4 threatening c2.
1106,32,11,Kxf7,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQ -',Black's king turns out to be completely safe on f7 and now the white king turns out to be the weak king.  Black has given up two pawns but his developmental advantage is growing and he now has an open e file to work with.  Also the d4 pawn is attacked and white cannot simply let it be taken or black will have two open files to work with.
1107,32,12,Be3,b'r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/2PP4/4BP2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR b KQ -',The only other move is the passive 8.Ne2 but after 8... Nb4! white either checks on c2 or on d3.
1108,32,13,Bb4+,b'r2q3r/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/1bPP4/4BP2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQ -',White activates with tempo.  The main point of this move is not even to develop the bishop but to bring his rook into the game.
1109,32,14,Re8,b'r2qr3/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/1bPP4/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',And white once again has a problem with the d4 pawn as the bishop is now pinned.  At the same time he has to worry about the bishop as the pawn weakness induced on move 4 means that e3 is now defended.  There is only one way to break the pin and defend the bishop...
1110,32,15,1Kf2,b'r2qr3/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/1bPP4/2N1BP2/PP3KPP/R2Q1BNR b - -',An ugly move that allows the following combination but what choice was there?  Black's development is so great and white's king has become a great target.  But now black is at the crossroads.  He must continue his attack.  He has (for all intents and purposes) completed his development and he must break through now or white will have time to develop and maybe his two pawns will come to fruition.  So black must either find a way to strengthen his position or he must attack with all that he has.  What's the move?
1111,32,16,1Rxe3,b'r2q4/ppp2kpp/2n2n2/5b2/1bPP4/2N1rP2/PP3KPP/R2Q1BNR w - -',Perfect!  White's king is drawn into the open where black is perfectly posed to meet his with another excellent sacrifice.
1112,32,17,Nxd4,b'r2q4/ppp2kpp/5n2/5b2/1bPn4/2N1KP2/PP4PP/R2Q1BNR w - -',This sacrifice strikes from the same place.  White can decline but Black is threatening c2.  He also threatens anything from Qe7  (Kxd4 Rd1 !) to Bc5.  Not an easy position to defend.  But it's always more fun when people accept your sacrifices.
1113,32,18,Qe7+,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/5n2/5b2/1bPQ4/2N1KP2/PP4PP/R4BNR w - -',With the point of 13.Kd2 Rd8! winning the queen.  Admittedly white would still be ahead in material but his position is completely tied down he has NO WAY to develop after 14.Qxd8 Qxd8  15.Kc1 Bxc3 16.bxc3 Qe7! where black infiltrates on the dark squares.  White can also play 14.Kf2 but this loses to 14... Bc5.  So white is left with one choice...
1114,32,19,1Kf4,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/5n2/5b2/1bPQ1K2/2N2P2/PP4PP/R4BNR b - -',His king comes further out into the lions mouth.
1115,32,20,1Bd6+,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/3b1n2/5b2/2PQ1K2/2N2P2/PP4PP/R4BNR w - -',White's bishop has done it's duty on b4.  Now it cuts off white's retreat to g3.
1116,32,21,1Kxf5,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/3b1n2/5K2/2PQ4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R4BNR b - -',No choice here 14.Qe5 loses the queen and allows mate in one to 14... Qxe5 and 14.Kg5 is mated very similarly to the mate in the game.
1117,32,22,1Qe6+,b'r7/ppp2kpp/3bqn2/5K2/2PQ4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R4BNR w - -',The queen covers the retreat along the light squares the bishop controls the dark.  There is no retreat.  14... Qd7  has the same purpose and is objectively equal.
1118,32,23,g5#,b'r7/ppp2k2/3bqn1p/6p1/2PQ3K/2N2P2/PP4PP/R4BNR w - g6',Ouch!  This was a short game but I think it gives a very pleasant first taste of the portuguese gambit.  I hope you enjoyed.  As always if you have any comments criticisms or analysis please PM me.

Black will develop his ""bad"" bishop onto g7 where is exerts tremendous pressure on White's queenside. Then Black often continues with queenside expansion via ..a6 and ..b5 with tactical play along the dark squares. Sometimes Black offers the pawn sacrifice ..b5 to open queenside lines (specifically pressuring b2) and sometimes divert the Nc3 from defense of e4 (allowing ..Nxe4). Black's main problem is space - White has most of it! The cramped nature of Black's position makes it somewhat difficult for him to develop his queenside minor pieces especially the c8 ""problem"" bishop (d7 is best reserved for a knight and b7 often interferes with a rook on b8). For this reason Black often hopes for an early ..Bg4 pinning the Nf3 to the queen (and preventing the powerful White maneuver Nf3-d2-c4 a key theme as a knight on c4 places tremendous pressure on Black's d6 pawn. Indeed so powerful is this plan that White plays an early h3 in many lines just to stop it!). White's plan is simple - use his massive space advantage to place his pieces on ""ideal"" squares and enforce the advance e4-e5 which often initiates kingside attacking possibilities. Black invariably meets this threat with tactics (really the only reason the Benoni is still playable) which make for a very exciting and double-edged game. A quick aside: a move deserving attention is 6..a6!? which prevents White's 8th move and thereby dodges the Flick-Knife attack. In light of White's healthy plus in the Flick-Knife this quirky move is probably worth further investigation. It would be an easy choice if not for White's speedy plan of 7.f4 g6? 8.e5! and White is crashing through.

Once White gets the e1 rook off e1 the pin on c3 is broken and the discovery on f3 loses its potency.  This capture is the the way to avoid the discovered attack by 12. Nf3.  Having said all of that I really don't like White's position.  The pinned pawn on c3 is taking away the best square for his knight the white knight cannot go to d2 to protect f3 because it must guard that pinned pawn.  To unpin the pawn the rook must leave e1 and only e2 seems a reasonable placement because it must hold the pin on the knight.  The e1 rook is hanging and the discovered attack by ... Nf6  will win the rook if it remains on e1 unprotected.  Once the pinning bishop is relocated to b6 it will attack White's kingside and the thing that troubles me most about White's position is that the kings knight is missing from the defense.  Again the queens knight cannot get there because it is tied down to the defense of the c3 pawn.  That means that White needs to find the tempi to get the c1 bishop into the game without blocking d2 as the knights' next post.  As White I would not like the situation where the queenside pieces have not been developed and Black just needs a target for his c1 bishop in order to gain tempo.  As White I would like to get the c1 bishop into play on this move but I think that Re2 is probably best in order to break the pin without leaving the rook hanging.  Still this is the first time I have seen this position and deeper study may prove my thinking inaccurate.

He must use his king because the rook is ill suited to protect both disconnected pawns.   If White begins toward the queenside with his King the Black rook will need to restrain him.  When White's rook attacks a passed black pawn either King or rook must be in position to protect.  Black expects the game to be decided on the queenside and will not use tempi to protect his kingside pawns.
But what is White's plan?   He seems to have only one possibility for a draw:  to capture  one or more kingside pawns getting a passed pawn on the kingside and race for a White Queen.   However Black has tempo; his queenside pawns are already passed and one is already on the fourth rank.   So if White chooses this path he must quickly produce a passed pawn.  Which one?  Obviously the f-pawn because it will become a passed pawn in just one move.

White cannot squander tempi he must leave the h7 pawn rather than waste a move capturing.  Having more pawns than black will not win because the deciding factor will be tempo not material.  

White's hope must be that he can get his distant king in front of the advancing Black pawns.  It may not be possible since it will require a 'juggling' act by his rook.  The rook must restrain the Black queenside pawns without helping Black get his King up the board!

The Black rook can move to a8 to prevent the White pawn from queening but may become overloaded; Black must rely on his king and not overload the rook.  White should be considering giving his rook for an advanced pawn and entering a new game with Queen and pawns against Queen and rook.     "
1278,35,91,d2,b'8/1R6/7P/8/8/rp3P2/3p2PK/3k4 w - -',The first black pawn reaches the seventh rank.
1279,35,92,5h7,b'8/1R5P/8/8/8/rp3P2/3p2PK/3k4 b - -',The white pawn reaches 7th rank.  The difference is the protection of the Black king and the absence of the White king.  White's rook is overloaded.  It cannot restrain the Black pawns and protect the White pawn simultaneously.  The White king is a non-player.
1280,35,93,5Ra8,b'r7/1R5P/8/8/8/1p3P2/3p2PK/3k4 w - -',As planned.  The Black rook prevents the White pawn from Queening.

1282,35,95,5Kc2,b'r7/7P/8/8/8/1R3P2/2kp2PK/8 w - -',Now d1 cannot be stopped and the rook 'sacrifice' must be given.
1283,35,96,Rxa3,b'8/7P/8/8/8/r4P2/2kp2PK/8 w - -',Black captures.  Avoiding the capture leads to the same endgame minus queens. 
1284,35,97,5h8=Q,b'7Q/8/8/8/8/r4P2/2kp2PK/8 b - -',White queens first.  
1285,35,98,5d1=Q,b'7Q/8/8/8/8/r4P2/2k3PK/3q4 w - -',White is down a rook his only hope is to get a king and rook fork with his queen or to hurdle the king for the rook.  The problem he faces is that the black rook can block the attack on the king because they are on adjacent ranks.  Meanwhile Black can intercede with the queen whenever the rook is protected offering the exchange of queens. 
1286,35,99,5Qe5,b'8/8/8/4Q3/8/r4P2/2k3PK/3q4 b - -',White centralizes his Queen.  Still the force of the Black Queen and Rook combined will quickly win.  Black's plan is to trade queens.  In order to do this he needs to control potential forking squares.  A hurdle does not look possible so only a pin or fork will avail; but the pinning or forking piece must be protected.  As an example if d6 were now protected by the rook Qd6 would pin the white queen and force an exchange.
1287,35,100,5Qd3,b'8/8/8/4Q3/8/r2q1P2/2k3PK/8 w - -',Black centralizes his Queen and moves to take away any meaningful move by the White Queen.  Black intends to protect the rook with the queen and to avoid moving into a hurdle position with the rook.

"
1290,35,103,5Qc5+,b'8/8/r7/2Q5/8/3q1PK1/2k3P1/8 b - -',Although the game is lost for white I like Kf2 as a defensive move much better than this move.  The checks will end sometime and it seems the king would be much more difficult to mate when he is within his pawns and the white queen can intervene to block the black queen or to check the Black king.  
1291,35,104,5Kb3,b'8/8/r7/2Q5/8/1k1q1PK1/6P1/8 w - -',There is no square from which the White Queen can check and so Black makes progress.  Qc6  now forks and exchanges the Queens; however Black would like to first obtain a better position nearer the white pawns with his King.

1293,35,106,6Rg6+,b'8/8/6r1/4Q3/8/1k1q1PK1/6P1/8 w - -',Yes Qd6 pins the White queen and exchanges.   Black plays what he views as a zwischenzug to get a better position for his rook and king when the queens exchange.

1295,35,108,6Kc2,b'8/8/6r1/4Q3/8/3q1P2/2k3PK/8 w - -',Black again neglects Qd6 in his quest for an improved position!   Still not playing Qd6!  In retrospect Qd6 is the fastest way for Black to end the game.    
1296,35,109,6Qf4,b'8/8/6r1/8/5Q2/3q1P2/2k3PK/8 b - -',Oops!  White also missed ... Qd6.  Still this appears to be the best move.  It is always dangerous to leave two important pieces on the same line. However the White queen denies h6 to the rook.   
1297,35,110,6Qd6,b'8/8/3q2r1/8/5Q2/5P2/2k3PK/8 w - -',"The exchange is forced.  

In conclusion.  White finished the opening with the initiative.  White focused on the play on e5 while Black was most concerned with gaining the initiative and was willing to give material in order to have it.   Once into the middle game White was intent on carrying out his attack and Black developed his plan to use the queenside pawns to produce a queen.   Still Black had to respect White's attack while husbanding the pawns.  Once the initiative changed hands Black began trading pieces in order to reach a pawn ending.  In the ending White may have lost tempi and Black played to conserve tempi and to queen.  The race to queen was a draw but White had to give up his rook in order to get his queen.  That left Black with an overwhelming material advantage and Black played to exchange Queens.  The game was decided by tempi.  Black developed his pieces earlier and even though a knight short (for two pawns) he slowly encroached on the space and his pieces gained force.  White may have been intent on his attack just a little longer than prudent.  It's hard for an attacking player to give up the attack.   White's loss of tempo left him with a backward end game.  Here are some lessons from this game:
1.   It is worthwhile to pause when the pawn structure becomes fairly certain and to see the board as if the pieces were removed.  Then one can see the probable endgame and can husband and position the proper pawns and hold the right pieces. 
2.   Serendipity loses to planning.  In the middle game players often have their full focus on the tactical possibilities.  It is important to pause and plan.
3.   The danger in offering a gambit is that if the opponent withstands the attack he usually gets the better endgame.  
4.   Time and space offer temporary advantages and must be respected on every move of the game.  The questions are always:  Who has the initiative?  Can I gain/lose tempo?  How can I empower my pieces (Gaining space)?  "
