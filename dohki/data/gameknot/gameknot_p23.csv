That means after 31. Qb7+ black has to block on d7, after which white simply exchanges on d7 and then plays Nxf8, forking King on h7 and whichever piece black has on d7, and ends a rook and pawn up. Luckily, my opponent missed that and allowed me to play...."

I am hoping that there is a miscalculation which will turn it the other way or end the game in a draw.  But, that isn't so since black is keeping the advantage.  The reason for his advantage is because his g and h pawns are dangerous.  In fact, those are the killers.  With two isolated pawns against his connected pawns, black has the better end of it.

It was due to a similar fork that GM Susan Polgar showed in her book of Chess Tactics for Champions.  As that Bishop would've been free.  In doing so, I would've been able to move my Kc6 and promote the passed pawn.  And, Carl wouldn't have been able to stop it in anyway.

The reason why it's Hope Chess is that mate will be inevitable, unless Carl messes up.  But, if he does that, I could still pull a swindle and get a stalemate.  I've seen examples from Susan where one side is even further ahead then black will be, even after he promotes.  But, Jack said that I have no hopes and implied that there will be no mistakes.  I don't completely trust him since he some time ago made a mistake that allowed me to checkmate in a hopelessly lost position."

That's because my monarch is stuck in the corner.  So, after 58.Kh7, Carl can just leave the Queen there and play 58...Ra7.  After that, my N is pinned, and thus, forces 59.Kh8.  From there, he'll checkmate with 59...Qxg7#  Seeing all of that, I resigned here.  I think the important lesson is that even if something happens that makes you angry, you shouldn't let get it you in a game.  Since that will affect one's judgement as it will happen to me.  For example, that's the main reason why I went back to exchanging just because it was possible to do so.  As otherwise, I would've been more patient and held off.  But, the other lesson is that opportunities only last a shortwhile.  And, had I play 47.Nf7+, I would've been back in the game with an advantage.  But, by missing that followed by another inaccuracy, it was over for white.  Well, after this game, Carl and I played one more which remains unfinished as we ran out of time.  But, Jack still took the time to coach like he did with these two games."

You could just take on f7 anyway, giving two pieces for a pawn and a rook and then play Qh5 at the end to pick up the h7 pawn anyway.

Qh5 is the same but now black can't block with Ng6 so easily. if 12..Ng6 then Nxf7 Rxf7 Qxg6 (not possible right now because the h7 pawn would protect g6) and white is crashing through winning the exchange in a great position instead of in an unclear position.

White is an exchange up and is well developed with a nice safe king. For that, black has a pawn, which is a potentially strong passed pawn on the c-file. They are also well developed and their potentially weaker king position might be a strength because queens are off. White is better and want to trade some minors, pressure the b and c pawns with rooks, and try to cut off black's counterplay and so play for a win or draw. Black has a nice b6 bishop and could try to pressure the f2 pawn. Or they could put the rook on the h-file and try to get an attack against the white king. Knights are also tricky pieces and so they should always be on the lookout for tactics and forking variations.

First of all this trade of the knight for bishop, while good, is not as good as it might be able to be in the future. The threat of the discovery is stronger than the execution. Also all the simplifications benefit white by trading down to a better endgame. Black really wants to keep some complexity in the position and trade in a more favorable way.

With the knight undeveloping itself, an aggressive more into the centre seems best to me. 

White has opening advantage plus an extra two tempi?  Joe: my vote is similar, but it would be 10.d3 The idea being to prevent an exchange because if 10.d4, she can play 10...exd4, and I'm keeping in mind what kenneth_fiore_3 told me about exchanges which is to hold off on that. And, that was due to me getting impulsive and doing so whenever possible which is a big no no.  ION: I'll join in...
... but for reasons of a rather erratic attention span (I've only just seen this thread though it must be three days old already) I do not wish to 'captain' the side. I reckon charleshiggie would be very suited to the role. 

My vote: 10.d4 

Seems to me as good a time to stake a big claim on the centre, and it frees the Q-side for development. 

Black's immediate programme will be to reorganise her Q-side. We can use that time to develop our own.  Jeremy: I also vote 10.d4 

It's a bit aggressive but with the position, and the knight not challenging, we stake a nice claim on the center, open a space for our dsb to move, and gets us one step closer to completing development. "

This seems the obvious way to develop the knight as the c3 square isn't available. From here it'll probably go to f1 and then g3 for a kingside assault, which would free our bishop on c1 at the same time. 

White could also consider 11.c4 or 11.a4 to threaten on the kingside but it feels a little premature to me. 

jkarp - I think the exchange would be to our benefit. If ...exd4 then cxd4 and we have a central pawn duo and good control of the centre.  Joe: I agree with you Simon which is why Janet did not play 10...exd4 So, I change my vote. I like 11.Nd2, but this appears to cramp Knight. Then, again, there are situation where this must be done. However, another move that develops which I was also thinking about was 11.Bg5. Therefore, this is my new vote. Although not even a half pin, there appears to be some pressure against Janet's Nf6. And, in somewhat similar positions to this and the same scenario as we're seeing here, I have played moves like this. Therefore, my vote is now 11.Bg5.  ION: The Quieen's knight...
... will develop via Nb1-d2-f1 and the e3 or g3 as we think best. I believe we can afford to maintain the tension in the centre for now. Let Black exchange if she durst. I don't reckon she will. If she plays 11...Bb7, we can support the e-pawn with 12.Bc2. "

12.Bc2. 

Reason is that we will want to move the d2-knight again very soon, in order to free the dark-square bishop. The knight will have to go to f1, and thence to e3 or (more likely) g3. But before moving the knight we ought to ensure the protection of the e-pawn, hence playing the bishop move first.  Joe: I don't know how this frees a square for the N. As that moves the LSB, as opposed to, the DSB. I know that Bf1 would. Therefore, believe it or not, my vote is the same as ION but for a different reason. If it were for freeing the N, I'd vote 12.Nf1. But, what I like about 12.Bc2 is that the both of the Bishops are nicely aligned. As I analyzed a training game between adevela and Steppenwolf. And, what I learned just by being a spectator is that you want your B's aligned and vertical to each other. So, 12.Bc2 is my vote.  Ron: I would also suggest 12. Bc2. That's if I can join in on this game. I know it would be the 3rd time moving this piece, but I like the Bc2 position.  "

Continuing the plan. 

13. a4 or 13. b3 are also worth considering.  ION: I'd be ...
... happy with 13.Nf1 or 13.a4. If there is otherwise an even split, I'll probably go with the knight move. The a4 move is on the cards sooner or later. It can afford to await the further development of our pieces.  Jeremy: I really like b3 to activate the dsb and prepare for a4 (coming). Nf1 is an interesting decision, but my preference is b3.  Charles: On this opening database, Nf1 seems to be the most popular move, but a4 and b3 seem to score better...  Joe: Which is my vote. And, that's because the idea is freeing up our DSB. So, my vote is for 13.Nf1.  Simon: I can definitely see the merits of a4 and b3. 

If we go down the Nf1 and subsequently Ng3 or Ne3 then we'll have ended up moving the knight three times and the bishop 3 times, which is hardly what the grandmasters recommend! 

By playing b3 (or a4 and b3 later) we can develop the bishop without having to move the knight again and hopefully retain more opening advantage. 

I'll switch my vote to b3 just to keep things interesting.  "

Once I announced, and Jack felt again and used the good eye, he realized that the K can't go anywhere.  I believe that at first, he thought it could go to d7, in which, it's level.  But, he knows otherwise.  And, with it, I told Jack that this is the reason that I let Carl win back my Knight with 8.Qf3  That is due to this threat.  As the moral of this story, Jack told Carl not to play the Sicilian Defense because it is difficult for beginners to learn.  Now, some have told me that, but I disagree with Jack's assessment since it is an analyzed.  In fact, not only don't I agree, but his comment made me angry.  For, when I was a beginner, the Sicilian Defense is the first defense that Jack me learn and remember.  And, the second opening that I had to learn was, in fact, the Open Variation of the Sicilian, or Open Sicilian.  My take on it is to evaluate if you're going to lose a pawn, if you take the piece.  Plus, will recapturing lead to mate.  So, my assessment is something that Jack mentioned a couple of weeks ago, as well as, what GM Susan Polgar stressed.  And, that is to ask yourself what your opponent.  Had Carl seen what was unfolding, he would not have taken my e4 pawn.  And, if he saw this mate, he would've answered with 8...f3 or 8...Be6  After which, I would've retreated my Nd4.  Well, after this game, it was what you had expected, and Jack's analyses improves, while my assessment deteriorates which is one of the reasons that Carl will win the next game.  And, in the third game, although an unfinished, Carl will get a better pawn structure and slight initiative.  As Jack's analysis will be back to what we're used to seeing. "

In this game my opponent transposes the Ruy Lopez into the Fried Liver Attack.  This type of attack will lure Henry onto e6 before he has time to tuck himself away on the kingside.  Somehow he manages it.  White proceeds with his attack but leaves a vital pawn undefended.  This ushers in our familiar Chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey.  White had no escape.  So, how did it happen?

An excellent London System against a Hypermodernist.  The London System can be used for virtually every defense the the Black pieces can conjure.  This offensive opening has foolowed all the opening principles thus far and should be a sound position.  Seemingly passive?  Ha...just goading Black to advance poorly!

On the other side of the board, Black has chosen to wiat on a good home for the King's Knight.  this is a theorectical ploy in the Modern Defense.  Either Nh6 looking for f7 after the f-pawn advances or e7 after that pawn advances.  Often here you may find a ""Hippo"" structure without the advanced b-pawn.  Also a very strong defense.

Obviously this game is starting very positional and will play well to those wanting a highly strategic game.

This is the first violation of opening principles.  ""Avoid moving any piece twice before the Rooks are connected or an opening sequence is complete"" (humbly, my wording only).  Obviously there are exceptions especially when material or some static/dynamic can be obtained.

Once a principle is violated by one, the opponent must look at the cost but often looks to ""see"" how to punish the violation.
Another ""candidate"" move should be considered in line with opening principles unless a tactic can earn an advantage.  Other CM's might be 0-0, h3 to tuck the DSB away if needed, and even a theorectical a5 often played to ""attack"" Black's Queenside or al least offer tension."

And, she also stressed it in the mega bundle course that I purchased which is, ""Polgar University 2017.""  This is everything that she is covering in the university where she is teaching chess.  So, by ignoring what's occurring, Jack will be able to get the exchange that Susan has mentioned.  Second, in the process, Mr. Stockel will be able to double up my pawns.

So, after the game was over, we played through some variations right after 24.Kf2.  It involved black playing 24...Re7.  Yes, there was one mistake much later that lost with his passed pawn.  But, this is where my instincts (thought process) was verified.  For after, 24.Kf2, Re7, or 24...Qd7 if black plays everything accurately, it's, at the very least, a draw.  And, if white makes one error, black would, in fact, be able to win.  Of course, Jack wouldn't have made it, but I did have the opportunity to draw the game up until now.  But, that also shows that unlike some previous games, I had a very good reason to be happy about my position.  But, this blunder, it's game over, at once starting with his next move.  "

And, that became one of the main teaching lessons since we spent about 30 minutes studying what happens after 24...Re7 before starting the next game which I also lost with a back rank mate.  That's when he later reemphasized how important King Safety is.  And, there was, I believe, a 15 minute lesson before we had to pack up and leave."

In fact, after that, I'd threaten, perhaps, mate again with something like Bb4 forcing further liquidation, and perhaps, a later Qc5 with Qe7 or Re1 in mind.

But, that is going to change.  Even though there's no tournament game, Mr. Stockel wants all of his students to have a chance to play for learning purposes which is sensible.  And, what he told Perry is that it's even.  I agree.  It stays like this for now but will change shortly when the first mistake is made.  For one move only, Jack gave him advice.  I thought that this would go on and off, in which, it would turn into an OTB consultation game.  But, that didn't occur since Jack was busy studying the OTB tournament games."

However, this is where Jack gave Perry advice to exchange on e2, first by saying, ""Take the Bishop"".  He was wondering, and questioned it.  But, Jack told him just to take that way.  Then, after looking harder, he said, ""Ok, if you say it is the best move, it must be.""  And, he played 12...Bxe2  Even though I didn't say anything, I agree with Jack.  However, Jack was going to spend time on the tournament, and when the games were over, that's when he was going to give his post game analysis on what the player did wrong.  In fact, that's one reason that there are absolutes time controls, as well.  On top of getting used to it for the real deal with tournaments, having the restrictions, gives Jack time to analyze and give advice for the future.  As that way, you learn and improve."

That was during my win against Jack Stockel as it would have doubled up his K side pawn structures.  In which, I might have been happy afterwards.  Well, that is about to happen here, and I am quite here.  But, if that's not enough, there's even more as we'll see soon."

But, after the game we played through some variations, and it turns out that this is the losing blunder.  It looks like black isn't going to lose any more material.  However, the real threat is against his King.  And, that threat is unavoidable now.  As Jack pointed out, best was 18...Ne4  And, despite moving a pinned N, it doesn't lose any more material since my Queen is attacked.  After I retreat, he analyzed what happens after I believe it was 19...Rc8  From there, we continued after the game.  It turns out that with being a piece up and not allowing counterplay, including the stalemate ideas, I would've won.  But, it would've been very difficult.  And, I would not have won until the very end.  With this move, however, it is over very quickly in a way that I almost overlooked.  The only way around that is to take back with his Queen, instead.  But, it would still be lost.  As now, you're talking about a free Q, and I would do whatever possible to prevent counterplay.  He obviously saw that and doubled up his pawns which will end the game even faster."

Had it not been for my loss against bhidragon, I would've overlooked this.  However, after I made a terrible blunder and hyperfocused developing my Nb1, this was his winning move.  I was only able to apply this technique once.  And, it was against Ted.  The win would've taken a little longer, but I would've either mated or won the Queen.  In that case, it was a checkmate.  But, in this position, it is a mate immediately.  Before playing this very move, however, I did ask myself a position somewhat similar to this that occurred with GM Susan Polgar in the mega bundle.  Since in that game it would've worked.  So, I asked myself what would happen if Perry moved his Rf8.  As it would be the question of can he defend and get the K out.  At first, I thought yes, but when I reanalyzed and saw where his K is, I determined that it's a no.  Unlike that game, Perry has only one move that he can make with his K, but it is not going to help which means that there is no escape here since it is, pretty much stuck in the corner.  With that, I played this as it forces an immediate win."
