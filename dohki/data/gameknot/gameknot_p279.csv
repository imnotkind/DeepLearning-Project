82,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Winning a game always feels wonderful and it is something that fuels the desire for many people to play more chess but it is the difficult study and struggle that helps you improve your game. I played this game after a week study of positional play. I undertook it in hopes of improving my ability to place my pieces more aggressively and securely. This game was the reward that I claimed from it.
83,1,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The game began with an Indian Defense response from my opponent.
84,1,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I developed my K-side Knight first to wait and see where my opponent would place his K-side bishop...
85,1,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',but he develops his other Knight instead thus transposing into the Mexican defense
86,1,4,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I wanted to avoid a pin on my Knight so I moved the pawn to a3 before developing the Knight to c3.
87,1,5,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',My opponent responded in similar prophylactics but this weakens the Black K-side. Furthermore the pin would hardly have been that annoying for Black since now that i played a3 the only good way to develop his K-side bishop to is e7 - and that intercepts the pin rendering it harmless. Therefore imho this was a wasted flank move that also weakened Black K-side.
88,1,6,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I continued with my intended development here expecting my opponent to make the move d5 battling for the CENTRAL CONTROL creating a position somewhat similar to a Queen Gambit declined...
89,1,7,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbpp1/2n1pn1p/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',But my opponent neglected the importance of the center of the board and that allowed me to seize it myself...
90,1,8,e4,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbpp1/2n1pn1p/8/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',"With my Q-side Knight developed and not pinned by anything I brought the third pawn into the center of the board.
I can mention that my previous study had helped me to reevaluate the IMPORTANCE OF THE CENTER myself. Prior to that my view towards the center was somewhat ignorant even though not entirely non-existent."
91,1,9,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2nppn1p/8/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',My opponent formed a defensive center that allowed me to plan and initiate central breaks thus giving me a lot of INITIATIVE.
92,1,10,Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2nppn1p/8/2PPP3/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Before planning any sort of an opening in the center I need to get my own King off of it. I intend to castle K-side so I need to develop my K-side Bishop first. Developing it to e2 would be completely passive ...the Bishop does a whole lot more on d3 most importantly it plans the move e5 attacking the Knight and opening up the b1-h7 diagonal that becomes very strong if Black castles K-side.
93,1,11,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1pp1bpp1/p1nppn1p/8/2PPP3/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',My opponent might be intending a flank attack with b5 but it doesn't carry much threat as b5 would be responded with b3 - securing the center one more time. So a6 was also a wasted move...

96,1,14,Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p1nppn1p/8/2PPP3/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I make my last preparation with 9. Re1 - it gives me more attacking lines against the Black King. Here I might be thinking about exchanging my f3 Knight to open up the d1-h5 diagonal for my queen and then plan for some sacrificial attacks like Bxh6. It also enables me with a possible Rook lift to the third rank and increase the pressure on the pawns in front of the Black King. Additionally it increases my control of the e pawn. Other than all that it is a normal developing move that masks up my pending plan a little...

It will force the Black Knight to move thus giving me a tempo while i succeed in clearing the b1-h7 diagonal. Moreover the Black pieces are denied access to the K-side making my K-side sacrifices worth thinking about.
99,1,17,Nh7,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbppn/p1n1p2p/4P3/2P5/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',"The Black Knight doesn't have any good squares to go to:
Nh5 would loose the Knight to g4;
Ng4 would loose it to h3;
Ne6 would cramp up the Black pieces even more than they already are;
And Nh7 helps White develop with yet another tempo..."
100,1,18,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbppn/p1n1p2p/4P3/2P5/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Now White is threatening to take the h7 Knight without any compensation for Black

I was happy of my performance in this tournament game since I achieved it through some meaningful chess study that I had never taken up that seriously before. And with that note I would like to encourage everyone who wants to improve their chess to spend more time studying game principals and theory rather than just experimenting various moves in the games. ;)"
111,2,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A change from my usual response.
112,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One which Chuck intends to punish.
113,2,2,1Ng5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/1qn5/2bQP1N1/2B5/8/PPP1K1PP/R1B2R2 b - -',I've been told that this is book opening (or at least a book position).  In any event White certainly has a lot of firepower targeted on my f7 square.
114,2,3,1Ne7,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/1q6/2bQP1N1/2B5/8/PPP1K1PP/R1B2R2 w - -',This was my way of putting the question to White.  I wanted him to withdraw his Queen though after Qf3 I am not so sure that I gained all that much.  Charles was never one to retreat however.  He charges full speed ahead into the attack.
115,2,4,1Nd6+,b'r1b3k1/pp1p2pp/1q1N2n1/2b1P3/2B5/8/PPP1K1PP/R1B2R2 b - -',White can now draw by repetition.  The better move to play for a win was probably Ng5 check.
116,2,5,Bxd6,b'r1b4k/pp1p2pp/1q1b2n1/4P3/8/3B4/PPP1K1PP/R1B2R2 w - -',I felt an additional guard for f8 wouldn't hurt.
117,2,6,hxg6,b'r1b4k/pp1p2p1/1q1b2p1/4P3/8/8/PPP1K1PP/R1B2R2 w - -',Taking the d5 pawn would have allowed a back rank mate.  By capturing at g6 I gave my King a flight square.
118,2,7,b6,b'r1b4k/p2p2p1/1p1q2p1/8/8/4B3/PPP1K1PP/R4R2 w - -',Threatening Ba6 check.
119,2,8,Ba6,b'r6k/p2p2p1/bp1q2p1/8/2P5/4B3/PP2K1PP/R4R2 w - -',Bb7 was probably better.
120,2,9,Kh7,b'4R3/p2p2pk/bp4p1/8/2P5/1PK3P1/7q/8 w - -',White resigned; at least he got in one final check!!
121,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',We both enjoyed a good over the board battle so fighting varations were the norm for our games.

126,3,5,2Be4,b'r6r/1bq2pp1/p1pp1k2/5Pp1/4B3/8/P1P1Q2P/4RKR1 b - -',A questionable continuation as it allows me to activate my pieces while temporarily pinning the Bishop.
127,3,6,2Qb2+,b'4r2r/1bq2pp1/p1p2k2/3p1Pp1/2P1B3/8/PQ5P/4RKR1 b - -',Breaking the pin very nicely!!
128,3,7,2Bg2+,b'4r2r/1bq1kpp1/p1p5/3p1Pp1/2P5/8/PQ4BP/4RKR1 b - -',I'm not sure but I think I might have grabbed the d5 pawn in the process.
129,3,8,Qf4+,b'4r3/1b1k1pp1/p1p5/3P1Pp1/5q2/8/PQ4BP/5KR1 w - -',Surprise!!  Charles thought the Queen was tied to protecting the b7 Bishop and wouldn't move because of Qxb7 ch.  Don't you just hate those unexpected checks?  ( I mean the kind you can't cash!!)
130,3,9,2Qf2,b'4r3/1b1k1pp1/p1p5/3P1Pp1/5q2/8/P4QBP/5KR1 b - -',No other good option is available.  Actually that would have been a good time to resign and move on to the next game.
131,3,10,2Qc1+,b'4r3/1b1k1pp1/p1p5/3P1Pp1/8/8/P4QBP/2q2KR1 w - -',And White resigned.
132,4,0,Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3pp1/pqnQ1b1p/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/2KR3R w - -',Having lost a pawn already I really did not want to exchange Queens at this point.
133,4,1,1Kb1,b'r1b2rk1/1p3pp1/pqnQ1b1p/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/1K1R3R b - -',An oversight that permits me to regain my pawn; f3 was better.

136,4,4,2Na5,b'1r4k1/1pQ2pp1/p1n4p/N2Np1b1/4P3/5Bqb/PPP3P1/1K1R4 b - -',I believe that 21. Nc5 Bxg2; 22. Bxg2 Qxg2 23. Nxb7 offers White more.
137,4,5,Qf3,b'2r3k1/1p3pp1/p6p/Q3p1b1/4P3/2N2q2/PPP5/1K1R4 w - -',Threatening to win a piece.
138,4,6,2Ne2,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p7/3Qp1bp/4Pq2/P2R4/1PP1N3/1K6 b - -',29. Qxd8 ch Bxd8; 30. Rxd8 ch Kh7 and I believe I have an endgame advantage.
139,4,7,2Qf1+,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p7/3Qp1bp/4P3/P2R4/1PP1N3/1K3q2 w - -',White resigned.
140,5,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is only a few moves Okay. Match was Dorset vs Devon
141,5,1,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1bB1/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Wow. I went in that once. He was playing to fast.
142,5,2,Bxd8,b'rn1Bkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',There. White wins black's Queen. And soon. Dexter resigned with only 4 moves.
143,6,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',American Chess had reached new popularity in those days bolstered no doubt by Bobby Fischer's triumph at Reykjavik in 1972.  However truthfully I had toyed with game while I was in college at Purdue but I really never played it with any compassion until I learned that it could help pass the time away in Southeast Asia.  My chess buddy there was from the Phillipines and taught me a great deal about openings and tactics.
144,6,1,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',The poisoned pawn varaition had become rather well known by this time still I thought maybe that that was where my opponent was heading.
145,6,2,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Sorry not this time!!  Still a slight sigh of relief he was using a variation I was somewhat familiar with albeit from the other side of the board.
146,6,3,e5,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p1B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Opps perhaps I spoke too soon.  More common (at least at that time) is 8. ----- Qc7 (and it was certainly most familiar to me.)
147,6,4,Nf5,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4pNB1/4PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Ne2 and Nb3 were also available but I opted for something I felt was more aggressive.

150,6,7,1Qg2,b'r3k2r/1p2bppp/pq1p1n2/4pPB1/3n1PP1/2N5/PPP3QP/2KR1B1R b kq -',I had intended to put my King's Bishop here when the time was right.

The drawback is that it also lets Black open a line to my Queenside for his dark squared Bishop.  But then I was also hoping that I could do something on the Kingside before he did something on the Queenside. 
152,6,9,1Bd3,b'2r1k2r/1p2bppp/pq3n2/4pPB1/3n2P1/2NB4/PPP3QP/2KR3R b k -',While this provides additional protection for my c2 square it also blocks the file for my Rook at d1.
153,6,10,1h6,b'2r1k2r/1p2bpp1/pq3n1p/4pPB1/3n2P1/2NB4/PPP3QP/2KR3R w k -',Forcing the Bishop to do what it was going to do anyhow - withdraw to a more useful position.
154,6,11,1Be3,b'2r1k2r/1p2bpp1/pq3n1p/4pP2/3n2P1/2NBB3/PPP3QP/2KR3R b k -',While the pin looks attractive providing additional support to the c3 Knight with Bd2 may have been better but I thought I would be able to take my Queen to the d2 square.
155,6,12,1Na4,b'2r1k2r/1p3pp1/pq3n1p/4pP2/N2n2P1/b2BB3/PPP3QP/2KR3R b k -',I felt that 17. bxa3 Rxc3 would leave me with more problems than I wanted.

As for myself I was just trying to survive;  I knew that if he ever got his Rooks connected I would likely be dead meat.  I briefly considered 23. Qxa6 Nxg4 or 23. Bxa6 Qxc2 ch but I never explored these any further at the time perhaps White has some resources available after these moves.
161,6,18,2Qxe5,b'2r2k1r/1Q3pp1/p4n1p/4qP2/3p2P1/3B4/P1P4P/1K1R4 w - -',On 23. ----- Qc6 (or Qc7) then 24. Qb4 ch Kg1; 25. Qxd4  or 23. ----- Qc3; 24. Re7

164,6,21,3Kc1,b'8/5p1k/5Pp1/4q1Pp/2Qp3P/2nB4/P1P5/2K5 b - -',Russell now undertakes a series of checks most likely intended to help him address his time control issues - and who knows maybe White will make a mistake.
165,6,22,Qxa2,b'8/5p1k/5Pp1/2K3Pp/2Qp3P/2nB4/q1P5/8 w - -',Russell takes a pawn and defends against the mate at the same time.
166,6,23,4Kxd4,b'8/5p1k/5Pp1/6Pp/3K3P/3B4/n1P5/8 b - -',I removed his advanced pawn from the board and regained my pawn's superiority.
167,6,24,4Nb4,b'8/5p1k/5Pp1/6Pp/1n1K3P/3B4/2P5/8 w - -',WHile time control is no longer an issue for Black his position on the board is.

170,6,27,4Kg8,b'6k1/5p2/5Pp1/2K3Pp/7P/3P4/8/8 w - -',Black may have been hoping for d4 when his King might have escaped the canyon.

I lost the first game making a lot of mistakes and my opponent took advantage of them winning easily the game. When I lost the first game I decided to concentrate to this game and don't make (a lot of) mistakes. I was playing carefully and with respect to my opponent. This game hasn't well-organized strategies and divine moves. I annotate this so you can see how emotions can destroy a game... It was a great lesson I took and I wanted to make it public.

When I saw this I was really angry with myself and I wanted to smash the computer. It wasn't the loss of the queen that made me furious but my blindness. There are some emotional rules which everyone must keep in order to play without unpleasant surprises. Even if you know playing chess masterfully if you underestimate your opponent (which I did after 7... exd4) weaknesses are expected. I believed that I won without doing something to prove this. Also after 7... exd4 and 8... Qa5  I never looked back. I didn't pay attention to the heavy weaknesses. Knight and Bishop were not for me attacking pieces. Ι believe that everyone had this problem sometime. He underestimated his opponent just because he thought that he was in a superior position. In the end that was only a fake idea. You may say that 10. Nc7  was obvious and I was just careless but I think that you did it too sometimes in the past and it wasn't obvious for you then. That's all folks. I hope you enjoyed the crash of my arrogance...

I've had a good night's sleep and am committed to playing for 2 wins today. This game begins with a simple tactical victory of a piece during the opening and my opponent just went downhill after that. There were several instances of him not hitting his clock after making a move. I tried to be a sporting as I could without actually telling him but I don't think it did much good. He just visibly fell apart after the last instance toppled his king then promptly withdrew from the tourney. I felt kind of bad for him but obviously I took the point and ran. White starts off 1. d4.

The problem is he forgets to hit his clock. I spend a few minutes deciding on my move and select Qa5. I stare at the clock for about 10 seconds. He sees me looking at it. I then get up and go smoke a cigarette. I'm gone for about 10 minutes. When I return he still hasn't hit his clock. I glance at the board then wander off to look at other games. From across the room I see him finally realize what is going on and he hits his clock with a look of utter disgust. I return to the board and play......

A White pawn can often be very strong on e5 if Black castles short but I believe this isn't the case. Black's mobility felt more strangled with that pawn on e4. 
12. e5 advances the relocation of the Black Knight on f6 so I'd say While lost some time with this move though he probably lost it with 11. Bd3. 
Notice also that this pawn now blocks the Bishop's access to the a3-f8 diagonal. If White would attempt to regain access to it with e6 then my d5 pawn would no longer be isolated and Black would gain some needed space in the center.
I think this move more than any other allowed me to think of a realistic draw."

Notice also that although the Black King didn't castle Kingside this feels a lot like a position in which sides would castle opposite. In such situations activity is the key - must go for the King. Should Black castle short it's life would be very difficult to cope with the pawn storm on the Kingside so in fact Black doesn't intend to caste and will instead help defend the weak center. 17. ... b5 also helps to prevent White from quickly opening files for the White rooks.

White may have intended to exchange pawns on b5 then after push the pawns to b3 and c4 to open up the d file... but this plan takes too much time. Black has other ideas for the Queen-side. A possible Rook exchange on c4 would be perfect for Black - a trade of rooks on c4 would help solidify the Black pawn structure provide some well needed central control and possibly free the Black Bishop on e6 from its defensive duties to the isolated d5 pawn.

White has a much better pawn structure. White's King-side pawn majority (4 to 3) will likely keep the Black King tied down to the King side and Black's light-square bishop will not be capable of defending both isolated b and d pawns. Black currently has too many weaknesses to expect a drawish endgame and a plan of defending the isolated b and d pawns with the king would leave the King-side pawns vulnerable to the overwhelming majority of an extra pawn the dark-square bishop bishop and the Black King.
547,20,40,2Kd2,b'5k2/5pp1/4b2p/1p1pP3/2rR2P1/4B2P/1PPK1P2/8 b - -',White improves the King's position bringing it back to the second rank. If the White King moves to d3 then exchanging rooks on d4 would be loosing for Black.
548,20,41,2Rc8,b'2r2k2/5pp1/4b2p/1p1pP3/3R2P1/4B2P/1PPK1P2/8 w - -',Black currently must regroup in hopes of weakening the White's pawn structure before exchanging the rooks

550,21,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"I'm going to explain the winning method of a simple position that arises from a complicated endgame. Most players know that you can't checkmate a lone king with 2 knights but not so many players know that you can often mate with 2 knights when the losing side still has a few pawns left.
I do not know how to start an annotation with an endgame position so please ignore the first part of the game which is just clearing off the material."
551,21,1,Ke6,b'4K3/n2n4/P3k3/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',"Opposition is most important in knight and pawn endgames since pawns knights and kings do not always have a spare move for zugswang situations while long-range pieces can easily waste moves.
In this position Black has the opposition. White would rather pass than move here because Black will make progress in cornering White's king. If it was Black's turn to move here then the winning process would take a lot longer. "
552,21,2,3Kd8,b'3K4/n2n4/P3k3/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',"White is forced to head closer to the corner.
2 knights vs. a pawn is usually a winning endgame if the pawn is blockaded and sufficiently far from promotion. In my experience this type of endgame occcurs when there are few pawns left compared to the number of pieces the losing side might sacrifice for the few pawns you have and hope for a draw in a position like this. 2 knights usually win against more than 1 pawn if the winning side can pick off the pawns and convert to a winning 2 knights vs. pawn endgame. Rook-pawn tends to be the most common version of this endgame since most endgames with very few pawns take place on a flank and rook-pawn is also the easiest since the blockading knight is already close to where the king will be cornered."
553,21,3,3Nf6,b'3K4/n7/P3kn2/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Black's goal here is to force White into either the a8 or a1 corner the blockading knight will be close enough to deliver checkmate in either corner. Black will use his king and knight to force the enemy king to one of those corners while the blockading knight restricts a few squares and you will only have to move it for the final mating maneuver. You must also be prepared to sacrifice the blockading knight in certain positions where you can use your only remaining knight to smother the enemy king behind his pawn
554,21,4,Ke7,b'8/n1K1k3/P4n2/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Mate would be impossible here (and in other endgames) if it was legal to pass a turn in chess but since it isn't White is forced to let Black restrict more squares. After White attacks the knight Black will oppose White's king two horizontal squares away and if Kxa7 then Kc7 Ka8 Nd5!! Ka7 (if a7 then Nb6#) Ne7 Ka8 Nc8 zugswang and White must let himself get mated a7 Nb6#
555,21,5,3Kb7,b'8/nK2k3/P4n2/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',37.Kb8 is worse since after 37...Kd8 38.Kb7 Black can seal off his escape route with 38...Nd7 while maintaining the sacrifice tactic. If 39.Kxa7 then 39...Kc8!! wins not 39...Kc7?? because the knight is in a different spot and doesn't have the right tempos to mate. 39...Kc8 wastes a move so that White is forced to play 40.Ka8 then 41...Nb6  Ka7 Nc4 Ka8 Kc7 Ka7 (a7 Nb6#) Nd6 Ka8 Nc8 a7 Nb6# If White plays Ka8 on move 38 instead of 38.Kb7 then 38...Kc8 forces Kxa7 and Kc7 just transposes to the variation discussed last move
556,21,6,3Kb6,b'8/n2k4/PK3n2/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',If Kb8 then Kc6 Ka8 Kb6 Kb8 Nd7  Ka8 Nb5 followed by Nc7# after White smothers himself.
557,21,7,3Kd6,b'8/n7/PK1k1n2/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',Now White should flee toward the a1-corner. If Kb7 then Nd7 seals off White and is similar to the variations discussed last.
558,21,8,Kc4,b'8/n7/P4n2/8/K1k5/8/8/8 w - -',When the enemy king is on the edge like this opposition is the key to forcing him back. You usually have to chase him with your king for a few moves until he's in a position where a knight can stop him from fleeing.
559,21,9,4Ka3,b'8/n7/P4n2/8/2k5/K7/8/8 b - -',If Ka5 then Nd7 just seals off the escape route forcing White to the same square so Black would gain 2 tempi since the knight needs to go to d7 anyway
560,21,10,4Ka2,b'8/n7/P4n2/8/8/2k5/K7/8 b - -',This part requires a lot of restriction technique because Black doesn't know which way White will flee. White doesn't have an escape path after Ka4 Nd5 so it's logical that White would play Ka2 and try to escape the other way. In a few moves I will explain the winning ideas if White's king decides to hover around a4 and a5.
561,21,11,4Kc2,b'8/n7/P4n2/8/8/8/K1k5/8 w - -',Black's king has effectively stopped White from escaping toward the center so Black can now get in Nd5 which seals off the king's escape route so that Black has time to figure out how to continue from here.
562,21,12,4Ka3,b'8/n7/P4n2/8/8/K7/2k5/8 b - -',Definitely not Ka1 because Black's whole plan is to get White's king into a corner. Willingly placing the king in the corner will lose quickly after Nd5 Ka2 Nb5!! imprisoning White onto a1 and a2 then Black will complete the mating maneuver with Nb4 Nd4 Nb3# and the mate will occur the same move White's pawn promotes so the new queen cannot do any damage.
563,21,13,4Ka4,b'8/n7/P7/3n4/K7/8/2k5/8 b - -',Ka2 Nb5 transposes into the mating variation discussed last
564,21,14,4Kc3,b'8/n7/P7/3n4/K7/2k5/8/8 w - -',This position is exactly the same as if Ka4 Nd5 had been played on move 42 White just made Black work a little by attempting to escape via b1. White will probably repeatedly play Ka4-Ka5 since after Ka3 Black makes progress with Nb6 Ka2 Nc4
565,21,15,Kc4,b'8/n7/P7/K2n4/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',The d5-knight is the only thing stopping White from escaping via b6 so the only time Black can move it is when White's king is on a4. Black needs to plan to get the d5-knight to b5 which creates a barrier (c6-c7-c8) and Black uses simple king maneuvers to force White's king to the a8 corner. White could avoid that barrier by heading toward the a1 corner which is the longest he can survive.
566,21,16,4Ka4,b'8/n7/P7/3n4/K1k5/8/8/8 b - -',Now Black can move the knight but Black shouldn't rush the Nd5-b5 plan because the knight also needs to be in a position to keep the king cornered if it decides to escape toward b2. Black should think ahead of the king reaching a2 if Black's king was on c3 and knight on c4 then it would reach the final mating barrier of the a1 corner.
567,21,17,4Nb6+,b'8/n7/Pn6/8/K1k5/8/8/8 w - -',This move doesn't bring the knight any closer to reaching b5 but it restricts a4 so now if Ka3 Kc3 Ka2 Nc4 Kb1 Kd2 is the key mating position in the a1 corner explained at the end.
568,21,18,4Ka5,b'8/n7/Pn6/K7/2k5/8/8/8 b - -',The knight needs to reach a square that threatens to go to b5 while also preparing for White to try to escape toward b2 in which case the knight needs to be controlling a3 for the final mating barrier. Control of a3 can be reached from c4 and b5 so the key square for Black's knight is d6 which is accessible from c8.
569,21,19,Nd6,b'8/n7/P2n4/8/K1k5/8/8/8 w - -',"Now if Ka5 Ndb5 Ka4 Kc3 Ka5 Kb6 Kb4 Kb7 Kc5 and White's king is restricted to a8 and b8. Once Black's king reaches Kb6 Black has two ways of mating depending on whether White's king is on a8 or b8.
If the king is on a8 then Kc7 Kxa7 Nb5  Ka8 Kc8 a7 Nc7#
If the king is on b8 then Ndb5 Ka8 Nc6 a7 Nc7"
570,21,20,Kc3,b'8/n7/P2n4/8/8/K1k5/8/8 w - -',Now that Black's knight has reached the key square d6 it can control a3 from b5 or c4 depending on where White flees. If Ka4 then Ndb5 forces White into the mating barrier on a8 explained last move.
571,21,21,Nc4,b'8/n7/P7/8/2n5/2k5/K7/8 w - -',Mating in this corner takes more work since the blockading knight is further away. Once White is restricted to two squares Black needs 4 knight moves to complete the mate. The blockading knight needs 2 moves to get to a square stalemating White's king and the other knight needs 2 moves to deliver checkmate. The only problem is that White's pawn will only need 2 moves to promote if the blockading knight moves so one of the 4 knight moves needs to be a check so that mate will occur the same move the pawn promotes.
572,21,22,5Kb1,b'8/n7/P7/8/2n5/2k5/8/1K6 b - -',If Ka1 then Kc2 Ka2 and Black can make the 4 knight moves needed for mate: (Nb5 Nc3 Nd2 Nb3) and one of those moves will have to be a check so the new queen won't have time to interfere or if White avoids the check the pawn still won't have enough time to promote.
573,21,23,5Kd2,b'8/n7/P7/8/2n5/8/3k4/1K6 w - -',Ka1 Kc2 goes into the position discussed last move.
574,21,24,5Ka1,b'8/n7/P7/8/2n5/8/2k5/K7 b - -',The difference in this position and the mating sequence explained a couple moves ago is that White's king is already in the corner so Black cannot make the 4 knight moves needed to mate and have a check in-between so the new queen has time to interfere.
575,21,25,5Kb3,b'8/n7/P7/8/2n5/1k6/8/K7 w - -',Black would've wanted it to be White's turn so that the mating sequence would include a check but in endgames where one side has control and the other is fighting for a draw the stronger side can use lots of zugswang and waste-a-move tactics to make progress such as in the knight-bishop checkmate which is a simpler ending than this since bishops can waste moves. Knights cannot waste moves so it's up to Black's king to force White onto a square where the mating sequence can occur. Kings can waste moves if they only need to control a couple of squares which has been demonstrated throughout this entire endgame.
576,21,26,Nb2,b'8/n7/P7/8/8/1k6/1n6/1K6 w - -',Black can keep White cornered while figuring a way to waste a move so that White will end up on a checkable square once he is restricted to 2 squares. Black can change the mating barrier to restriction of the c1 square by the knight while wasting a move so that White's king ends up on b1 once the barrier is finished. Here if Ka1 then Nd3 Kb1 and White's king is on a checkable square for the mating maneuver.
577,21,27,5Kb1,b'8/n7/P7/8/8/2k5/1n6/1K6 b - -',The difference in this position and the position after 51.Kb1 is that Black's knight gets a free move. You must understand tempo and opposition well to understand endgames especially knight and pawn endgames. When Black wasted a move the tempo of the game changed so now Black can transpose into any of the previous variations with an extra move so now when the barrier is complete White will end up on a checkable square instead of the corner.
578,21,28,5Nd3,b'8/n7/P7/8/8/2kn4/8/1K6 w - -',Black wants the position after 57.Ka1 Kb3 58.Kb1 so that White's king is on a checkable square and now Black can force White onto a checkable square (either b1 or a2) depending on how White continues.
579,21,29,5Kb1,b'8/n7/P7/8/1k6/3n4/8/1K6 b - -',If Ka1 then Kb3 Kb1 is the final mating net.
580,21,30,5Kb3,b'8/n7/P7/8/8/1k1n4/8/1K6 w - -',Compared to the position after move 54 Black's knight has gotten a free move so now the positions after Black's move waste are 1-move different than previous positions but still the same player to move which is exactly what Black was aiming for.
581,21,31,Kc2,b'8/n7/P7/8/8/3n4/2k5/K7 w - -',White's king is forced onto a checkable square so now mate can occur and Black has succeeded in winning this very complicated endgame.
582,21,32,Nb5,b'8/8/P7/1n6/8/3n4/K1k5/8 w - -',The first knight move restricts any escape and now Black only needs 3 more knight maneuvers. The knight on d3 needs to control a2 stalemating White's king while the other knight moves twice to control a1. White's pawn won't promote in time because White needs 4 moves one king move for when he gets cornered on a1 two pawn moves to promote and one queen move to interfere is one move too many
583,21,33,Nd4,b'8/P7/8/8/3n4/8/2k5/K1n5 w - -',Even if this ending doesn't occur commonly in your games I hope the concepts demonstrated will help you in other endgames. There are also more complicated versions of this endgame where White's king is centralized I may do a future annotation on.
584,21,34,Ndb3#,b'Q7/8/8/8/8/1n6/2k5/K1n5 w - -',Such a spectacular mate all the work has paid off.

633,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I was rummaging through an old storage box today (9/15/07) and I found some of my original annotations.  Accordingly I am revisiting some of the games I have placed here and updating them with where appropriate with some of my earlier thoughts.
634,25,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I probably would have headed into the poison pawn varations but it seems Richard had other ideas.

636,25,3,Nxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2Np4/8/4P1n1/3BB3/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This seems inconsistent with his sixth move.  Qd2 may be a more logical continuation.
637,25,4,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp4/8/4P1n1/3BB3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White seems willing to accept doubled doubled pawns on the King file in exchange for an open file near Black's King.  I do not like the open file but the doubled pawns and Bishop pair seemed like a fair exchange.  Besides my Knight can be easily forced from this post.  I don't like to waste time withdrawing. So.......
638,25,5,Qb6,b'r1b1kb1r/p3pppp/1qpp4/8/4P3/3BP3/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Attacking both the e3 and b2 pawns.

642,25,9,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/p3pp1p/1q2b1p1/8/4B3/1P3Q2/P1PN1RPP/6K1 w - -',Thus far White's 16th move pawn advance has netted him the loss of the exchange and a d2 Knight that is under attack.

647,26,0,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',?! Playing for a quick mate.

The bishop was definitely an option but I wanted the ability to attack the e3 pawn in the long run so I chose to go with opening up the e file instead.

I don't think it's a bad move because the knight could be more usefull in this position because of the linked pawns. Also I needed to bring my bishop out and exchange pieces because my position is a bit cramped.

807,31,10,Qe7,b'6k1/pp2qpbp/3p1np1/2pP2B1/2P2QP1/1P1B3P/P4P2/5K2 w - -',Now the knight can't go to d7 because the pawn on d6 was attacked. My position is getter and from this moment I'm only playing for a draw.

In the critical position both players actually thought that Black has the advantage! First words of White player after the game were ""I was lost"" and Black just kept saying ""I totally underestimated the attack"". It was pretty funny I guess :) This annotation will show that the position was in fact about even but it was Black who needed to be careful. I am annotating the game partly as a way to fully ""digest"" this loss and hopefully gain some useful learning points for myself and partly to amuse GK population especially those that do not play OTB chess (those who do probably have their own horror stories) :) So lets have fun!"

Maybe I am getting old? Should I start playing something safer like Caro-Kann? Time will tell probably... :)
848,33,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Alapin variation. IMHO the best way to avoid mainline Sicilian while still keeping good winning chances.

I never played against this move but the idea is very typical and not hard to spot - attack on h7 after Black castles. If White later plays Be4 (intending to take on d5) it can be interpreted as a waste of time compared to normal Bc4. The main problem with 7.Bd3 is that it does not pressure Black at all at this moment so it can be safely said that Black already has full equality.
852,33,6,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/3nP3/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Continuing with normal development while putting some pressure against e5 as usual in this type of position. I didn't yet consider 7...Ndb4; 8.Be4 d5; 9. ed6 Bd6 or 7...Bb4; 8.Bd2 Nf4. Both variations give equality but Black already has that so I felt that there is no need to be aggressive this early.

860,33,14,1dxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/3np3/3P4/P1NB1N2/1P2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Alternative is 11...Nc3; 12.bc3 d5 with blocked centre or 12...de5; 13.Ne5 Ne5; 14.Qe5 with a position that is hard to win due to the solid and easily defended pawn structure.

Ideally Black would like to play g6   Bf8   Bg7   Rd5 to put maximum pressure on the e5 pawn but this takes a lot of time and can't be done without some help from White (a loss of few tempi would help immensely). --- Time remaining: White 1:31 Black 1:47

Simple 16.Be3 with 17.b4 gives White a very solid advantage.
870,33,24,1Qb6,b'r1br2k1/1p2bp1p/pqn1p1pB/4P3/4Q3/P2B1N2/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Immediately taking advantage of unprecise 16.Bh6. I wanted to provoke 17.b4 in order to make the queenside pawns more vulnerable to an attack later.

Black can't play 17...a5 due to 18.Be3 Qc7; 19.b5  so now White has some space on the queenside. The advantage is not alarming since it is impossible to press simultaneously on both wings. I made two key judgement calls here: I) My opinion was (and still is) that in this position White should actually press his advantage on the queenside and transfer Bh6 back to e3. II) I estimated that White will not play 18.Be3 but will go for the kingside attack and in that case 17.b4 push could actually be exploited in a counterattack later.

When the Bishop comes to e8 it will reinforce the pawn chain making it difficult to destroy with sacrifices. 
873,33,27,1h4,b'r2r2k1/1p1bbp1p/pqn1p1pB/4P3/1P2Q2P/P2B1N2/5PP1/R2R2K1 b - h3',And here we go. White is trying to break Black kingside position with a frontal assault.

The correct move is again 19.Be3 which prevents 19...Nd4 and keeps the initiative after 19...Qc7; 20.h5. Precision is important in this position - Black is far from being completely helpless so his counterplay needs to be restricted. Direct attacks on the kingside can't succeed at the moment due to overprotected white squares (Be8 is crucial here) and no immediate mating motives on the black squares.
876,33,30,1Nd4,b'r2rb1k1/1p2bp1p/pq2p1pB/4P2P/1P1nQ3/P2B1N2/5PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',"My thinking at this moment was pretty much like this: ""This equalises the position.

This can be stopped only by giving up on the kingside attack and retreating Bh6 to e3. After that the game is probably equal but e5 a3 and b4 can become targets and if the Queen can infiltrate the queenside then Black should have the advantage."""

The reason for this discrepancy is the fact that from my previous experience I just employed the common plan for this kind of position while using mostly my opponent's time for making positional evaluations and plans (and some calculation of variations).
879,33,33,2Be3,b'r2rb1k1/1p2bp2/pq2p1p1/4P3/1P1nQ3/P2BBN2/5PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',After 9 minutes of thinking White finally admits that his kingside attack will not happen and retreats the Bishop. The game is still equal but I thought that Black has better prospects due to potential pressure on exposed White pawns. White offers draw Black after 5 minutes of evaluating the position refuses (the logic is explained above).

There are 2 candidate moves here with different plans involved: A) aggressive 22...Qc6 with either exchange of Queens and slightly better prospects for Black or queenside infiltration by Black Queen and B) passive but safer 22...Qc7 with 23...Bc6 and probably Bf8-Bg7 with pressure against e5. My greatest mistake was that I played 22...Qc6 after only 1 minute of thinking :I Obviously I did calculate the main variations previously but this move was rushed too much. Maybe it does not lose the game yet (I am still analysing) but now things get really tricky.

The attack against solitary king the trapped piece and weaknesses in the castled position.  Feel free to leave comments.
898,34,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French is a counter-punching opening.  A favorite of mine in the recent past I now exclusively play 1...c5.
899,34,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White opts for the main line French instead of the Kings Indian Attack with 2. d3.
900,34,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The central counter-strike.
901,34,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The Classical set up against the French is probably the most testing.  White avoids extending the center with 3. e5 and prepares to develop actively with 4. Bg5 among others.
902,34,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Another very interesting possiblity is 3...Nc6!? which transposes to a line of the Nimzowitch also known as the Hecht-Reefshlager.
903,34,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Another interesting line is the Modern Classical with 4. e5 Nfd7; 5 Nce2!?

White wants to exchange his bad dark-squared bishop for Black's good bishop.  This will leave Black with the problem light-squared bishop to deal with while White's light-squared bishop will find an active role to play very early.
906,34,9,Nfd7,b'rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',5...Ne4 is dubious.

In the days of romanticism where gambits were always accepted this led to some spectacular defeats for the second player.  Today with defensive technique much stronger this variation is almost extinct.

Bd3 is a very strong developing move that prepares for kingside attacks. As well it clears the kingside back rank so that white can castle.

I retire to the bar where several other chess heads are drinking heavily and analyzing games. I have a few drinks talk about the ones ""that got away"" and try to glean something useful from all of the chess talk I hear. And then things get really interesting. A wedding reception lets out just as a baseball team and entourage enter. I'm sure that was the most ecclectic crowd that bar has ever had. Well its off to the room and Ocean's 13 (don't bother....it was weak). See you in round 5!"
1056,39,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',On to round two of the 2007 Alabama State Championship. Feeling a little lucky after escaping round one with the full point I approach this game with a fresh attitude and my new pet 1. Nf3.
1057,39,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! We could debate the pros and cons of this move forever but I question it on many levels. Suffice it to say that I felt this move a provacative insult fully deserving to be punished as soon as possible.
1058,39,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Logical development which also hits e5.
1059,39,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Another move that just begs to be punished. Time for a big center and rapid development.
1060,39,4,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',Of course.
1061,39,5,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3pp2p/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?  I'm trying not to actually salivate on the board. I have no idea what my opponent is thinking but I am hoping that he continues to think it. 
1062,39,6,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3pp2p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Laying claim to a HUGE center.
1063,39,7,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? Black has shown me nothing so far. I guess he decided to just hunker down to defend my first attack. I have determined that this game is gonna be 100% offense for me. With my huge space advantage and lead in development I figure this to be a very entertaining attack.
1064,39,8,Qc7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I have no idea.............
1065,39,9,Bd3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Prepping e5 which opens lines if he 0-0.
1066,39,10,g5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2p2/2ppp2p/6p1/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq g6',? Ugly. Six moves in and black has yet to develop a knight or bishop and 6...g5 just opens up real estate around his king. This is gonna be fun:)
1067,39,11,e5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2p2/2ppp2p/4P1p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',My LSB is now a righteous dude.

1069,39,13,exd6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqn1p2/2pPp2p/6p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! Perhaps not my best as this move allows black to develop. However I'm thinking Ne4 holds promise.
1070,39,14,Ne4,b'r1b1k1nr/ppqn1p2/2pbp2p/6p1/2PPN3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The primary goal of this move is to immediately threaten capture on f6 if he moves a knight there. The second goal of this move is to trade knight for bishop on d6 then play an eventual Ne5 blockading his e pawn (which by proxy blockades his LSB). If I can accomplish this then I should have some really good attacking lines on the kingside.
1071,39,15,Bb4+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppqn1p2/2p1p2p/6p1/1bPPN3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',It never even occured to me that black would be willing to trade dark squared bishops. His looks so much better than mine.
1072,39,16,Qf4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1p2/2p1p2p/6p1/2PPNq2/3B1N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',?? Now he wants to trade queens and double his f pawns? I'm drooling again.
1073,39,17,1Qxf4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1p2/2p1p2p/6p1/2PPNQ2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Ok - you asked for it. I swear by all that is holy that Nd6  is coming next.
1074,39,18,1Nd6+,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1p2/2pNp2p/8/2PP1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I'm reminded of the Marcellus Wallace line from 'Pulp Fiction'. You know the one about getting medeival:)
1075,39,19,1Ke7,b'r1b3nr/pp1nkp2/2pNp2p/8/2PP1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?! Kf8 looks so much better here.
1076,39,20,1c5,b'r1b3nr/pp1nkp2/2pNp2p/2P5/3P1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Creating a nice post in a roundabout kind of way.
1077,39,21,1Ngf6,b'r1b4r/pp1nkp2/2pNpn1p/2P5/3P1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Finally entering the fray and looking to post up on d5.

NxN after the exchange of minor pieces I'll still be able to castle center my rooks and exploit the fact that his king is in the center and he has vulnerable kingside pawns. If nothing else I'm now double tapping his weak f pawn.
1079,39,23,1Ne8,b'r1b1n2r/pp1nkp2/2pNp2p/2P1N3/3P1p2/3B4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Attacking my strengths in order black looks to expel my Nd6.

1084,39,28,1Bxf5,b'r1b4N/pp1nk3/2p1p2p/2P2B2/3P1p2/8/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',With a comfy lead in material space and time I simplify and leave black yet another liabilty.
1085,39,29,1Ng6+,b'r1b5/pp1nk3/2p3Np/2P2p2/3P1p2/8/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Getting out of the corner and threatening to win another pawn.
1086,39,30,Kg5,b'r1b5/pp1n4/2p4p/2P2pk1/3P1N2/8/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?? Just horrible. Look at black's undeveloped pieces.
1087,39,31,Nf6,b'r1b5/pp6/2p2n1p/2P2pk1/3P4/3N4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black gets a breath of fresh air and finally has the chance to develop.
1088,39,32,2h4+,b'r1b5/pp6/2p2n1p/2P2pk1/3P3P/3N4/PP3PP1/R3K2R b KQ h3',There is no way I am going to give black time to start coordinating anything so I get his king moving again.
1089,39,33,2f3,b'r1b5/pp6/2p2nkp/2P2p2/3P3P/3N1P2/PP4P1/R3K2R b KQ -',Defending e4 and g4.
1090,39,34,2Nd5,b'r1b5/pp6/2p3kp/2Pn1p2/3P3P/3N1P2/PP4P1/R3K2R w KQ -',Black reaches the natural home for his knight and for the first time I invest a little thinking time to ensure I nail this thing down the right way.
1091,39,35,2O-O-O,b'r1b5/pp6/2p3kp/2Pn1p2/3P3P/3N1P2/PP4P1/2KR3R b - -',Ok his knight has a little mobility but I can counter it. With this move I coordinate my pieces and prepare to launch.
1092,39,36,2b5,b'r1b5/p7/2p3kp/1pPn1p2/3P3P/3N1P2/PP4P1/2KR3R w - b6',I long ago quit trying to understand some of my opponents moves. I'm guessing he hoped I would capture e.p. Who knows?
1093,39,37,2Ne5+,b'r1b5/p7/2p3kp/1pPnNp2/3P3P/5P2/PP4P1/2KR3R b - -',Time to win another pawn.
1094,39,38,Ba6,b'r7/p7/b1N2k1p/1pPn1p2/3P3P/5P2/PP4P1/2KR3R w - -',Black finally gets somewhat developed but Bd7 was stronger.

1098,39,42,2Nd5,b'r7/p7/b1N2k1p/1pPn1p2/3P3P/5PP1/PP6/2KRR3 w - -',Maybe Ne6 here. I'm not sure.

1109,39,53,3Ra7,b'8/R7/b1N2k1p/1pPn1p2/3P3P/5PP1/PP6/2K5 b - -',?! Again not my best. Yes I'm attacking an unprotected piece but I only force it to a better square.
