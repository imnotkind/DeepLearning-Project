0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The King's Pawn Opening.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The King's Pawn Game.  If he had opened with the Sicilian Defense (had played 1...c5 instead) I would have continued with my second favorite opening (the Open Sicilian).  Instead I am going to try for my favorite (the Ruy Lopez).  This attempt will work because this opening will transpose into the Ruy Lopez.  
2,0,2,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',? I understand that he wanted to continue with the Ruy Lopez but this move is not best.  Why?   He blocked his own Queen and DSB.  Afterall it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.  Therefore I will begin to get aggressive sooner then planned.  When will I start?  As soon as I castle.  
3,0,3,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',At this point he is planning to pin my knight with 5...Bg4 but it does not matter.  If 5...Bg4?! 6.Be2! breaking the pin immediately.  As I had noted earlier this is where I begin to get aggressive.  Therefore I am going to attack his e5 pawn and force an exchange.  Why?  In one of my previous annotations Expert inadowman noted that d4 is best in this position.  I believe this is a different exchange variation.  If I am correct an exchange variation has more transpositions then any other variations because an exchange variation=a position where multiple exchanges occur.
4,0,4,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pppbnppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',! He develops his LSB to break this pin.  At first I understood this logic but did not view this move as best.  Instead I thought 6...Nxd4! was best and the most well known played.  Then 7.Qxd4 with another exchange variation.  However 6...Nxd4 is illegal due to the mean.  Afterall this is direct pin because his knight is pinned to the king so he is not allowed to move that knight until he finds another to protect black's king like his LSB.  Therefore this move was best.  6...Qd7 also would have worked but there is a long term disadvantage.  What is it?  His Queen could eventually become pinned or trapped.  That happened in one or two of my other games when breaking a pin with my Queen.
5,0,5,Nc3,b'r2qkb1r/pppbnppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! At this point I decide to play a little more aggressively by developing my other piece.  Why?  If I had not played this 7...Nxd4!!.  Then if 8.Qxd4 8...Bxb5 so he still wins a free piece.  This move however takes away that feasibility.  Now if 7...Nxd4 8.Qxd4 Bxb5 9.Nxb5 so he does not get the advantage.  That is only half of my aggression but what is the other half?  That is coming up. 
6,0,6,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1ppbnppp/p1np4/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',In this position he is trying to exchange my LSB for his a6 pawn but it also does not bother me.  Why?  I decide to be very aggressive at this point so I am going to force another exchange variation with 8.Nxc6.  That way if 8...axb5?? 9.Qxd8 Rxd8 exchanging his Queen for my knight.  Therefore he will not take with his pawn.  Instead he will capture my knight and he can do this in 3 ways 8...Nxc6 8...bxc6 or 8...Bxc6.  Out of these three choices he will take with his knight.  
7,0,7,Bc4,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1np4/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',"Because he captured with his knight my bishop is still in danger.  This is a passive move but it is the ""cornerstone"" of my most aggressive plan.  That is why I retreated here instead of anywhere else.  The plan will come with a trick so stay tuned."
8,0,8,Be7,b'r2qk2r/1ppbbppp/p1np4/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Unless he wants to castle I do not know why he played this but it does not change my aggressive plan.
9,0,9,1Qf3,b'r2qk2r/1ppbbppp/p1np4/8/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',"As they say ""THIS IS IT THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!""  This is my most aggressive plan of the entire game and the trick that I have been planning since move 9 and that is why 9.Bc4 was played. This is the trick includes several aggressive moves for a few reasons.  First I was thinking of the ""Scholars Mate"" but in 10 moves instead of 4.  That's right if he is not careful 11.Qxf7# mating him in one.  Second Where did I get this idea?  It came from damaestro's last annotation as I had mentioned in the intro.   In that annotation cedeburca said ""I assume jkarp is going for the f7 square; hoping to put the queen on f3 and deliver mate.  It's disappointing to see him play it now.""  However this was the point.  Why?  There are more reasons why my trick invloves several aggressive moves.  That and the point of my last move will be explained shortly.
 "
10,0,10,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/1ppbbppp/p2p4/4n3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',I knew that he was going to fork my Queen and LSB with his Knight instead of falling for my attempted mate in one and that was the point of my last move.  Unlike my game against jstevens1 reversed psychology is directly involved this time.  Therefore I wanted him to think that he had the advantage with this move but this was the exact trick.  In this position I am not going to retreat my Queen but I will be much more aggressive instead.  What will happen?  I am going to attack his g7 pawn.  How can I do that and what are my options?  11.Qg3 is the only way.  If 11.Qg4?? he will take my Queen with his LSB or e5 knight.  Why do I decide to attack his g7 pawn.  The final reason why several aggressive moves were involved in this trick and my last move will be explained shortly.
11,0,11,Nxc4,b'r2qk2r/1ppbbppp/p2p4/8/2n1P3/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',? I knew he was going to take my LSB instead of protecting his g7.  This move looks good but there is a draw back.  After 12.Qxg7! his position becomes weak and that is why I decide to give away a free piece.  It appears that I made a bad choice and went wrong but this sac will become deflective sooner or later.  After I take his pawn his king is left in a vulnerable and that is why my plan involved a trick with several aggressive moves.  Afterall this was my long term plan and I wanted to put him in this type of position.  FYI I wanted to put him in this type of situation because I know that he is a very strong player and was an Expert at one point.  Therefore I was not going to mess around with my plans.  In other words I was going to exceute my plans in chronological order. 
12,0,12,Bf6,b'r2qk2r/1ppb1pQp/p2p1b2/8/2n1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',"?! He responds by attacking my Queen but I do not mind.  Afterall I will simply get it out of of danger.  Note: Although my followed through on my plan I am still going to play aggressively.  However ""The worst is over"" as they say.  In other words the most aggressive aspect was the long term plan as I had mentioned earlier."
13,0,13,Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/1ppb1p1p/p2p3Q/8/2n1P3/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',After this move I will respond by retaking.  Afterall I am not going to give this knight away.  This however is standard (the most common response with this move.)
14,0,14,Qe7,b'r3k2r/1ppbqp1p/p2p3Q/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',? He knew that my e4 pawn was hanging so this move is decided.  In other words he plays this move to win my e4 pawn but I have a short term aggressive plan to stop this.  Once again this plan however is less aggressive then before so what is the plan to protect my e4 pawn? 
15,0,15,1Qg7,b'r3k2r/1ppbqpQp/p2p4/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I decide to threaten.  Now if 15...Qxe4?? 16.Qxh8# mating him in one.  Of course he is not going to fall for that there are several.  Therefore he has three options.  What are they?  Mate can be prevented with 15...Rf8 15...Qf8 or 15...0-0-0.  He is going to castle Queenside.  I think however that 15...Rf8! is best in this position but am not sure.  Either way however it is no longer feasible for him to castle Kingside and that is why I gave up my bishop.  In fact this is why 9.Bc4 and 10.Qf3 was my aggressive plan.  Having said that 11...Nxc4? was a mistake for this reason.  In addition this is also where my Sac becomes deflective.
16,0,16,1Bg5,b'2kr3r/1ppbqpQp/p2p4/6B1/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now I take advantage and attack his Queen in an aggressive manner.  Note: I know where attacking pieces can become costly so I decide to take.  In other words if 16...Qxg5?? 17.Qxg5 so I know that he is not going to bother my LSB.  In addition I also know that his Queen is pinned to the d8 rook.  Therefore he must protect his Queen so I am going to win his d8 rook for my LSB.  
17,0,17,1Qxh7,b'2kr4/1ppb1p1Q/p2pq3/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',! However I had no idea that his last move leaves his h8 pawn hanging.  Therefore I decide to take advantage by grabbing it.
18,0,18,1Qf6,b'2kr4/1ppb1p1Q/p2p1q2/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',At first I did not know why he played this.  However I just figured out that this move is his attempt to win my Queen.  Now I have to be careful or he will take it.
19,0,19,1Rfe1,b'2kr4/1ppb1p1Q/p2p1q2/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?? At this point I am trying to protect my e4 pawn but I forgot that it is no longer hanging.  However this is also my loosing blunder.  Why?  
20,0,20,1Rh8,b'2k4r/1ppb1p1Q/p2p1q2/8/2n1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',In this position my Queen is now trapped.  Therefore 19.Qh3! would have saved the game.  Then if this had been played 20.Qf3 and I still would have had a chance..   
21,0,21,2e5,b'2k4r/1ppb1p1Q/p2p1q2/4P3/2n5/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',? At this point I am trying to force another exchange variation with this move.  How?  21.exf6 Rxh7. However that will not work this time.  Instead he is going to win my e5 pawn and my Queen is still trapped.  
22,0,22,2Qe4,b'2k4r/1ppb1p2/p2p1q2/4n3/4Q3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',At this point he might be trying to find a mating sequence with his Queen and e5 knight.  That is if he is able to play ...Ng4 followed by ...Qf2+ mate will become inevitable sooner or later.  Therefore I decide to prevent an immediate mating threat.  However the threat will still come back and he is clearly winning as I had mentioned earlier. 
23,0,23,2Bc6,b'2k4r/1pp2p2/p1bp1q2/4n3/4Q3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',However he takes advantage of the fact that my Queen is still trapped so he decides to attack it with his LSB.  Of course I have to protect the Queen but I am not going to move my Queen away from the e-file. 
24,0,24,Qh4,b'2k4r/1pp2p2/p1bp4/4n3/7q/2P5/P1P1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',In this position he is clearly trying to mate in two.  23...Qh2+ 24.Kf1 (forced) Qh1#.  Therefore I have to prevent this threat.  Of course 23...g3 is not going to help.  In fact I analyzed the position and came to the conclusion that 23.h3 is my only option. 
25,0,25,Qg5,b'2k4r/1pp2p2/p1bp4/4n1q1/8/2P4P/P1P1QPP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Now I have to be careful or he will mate in one.  What is the mating move?  That will be revealed shortly.
26,0,26,2c4,b'2k4r/1pp2p2/p1bp4/4n1q1/2P5/7P/P1P1QPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',?? At this point my goal is to exchange his knight for my c pawn.  However I missed the immediate mating threat. 24.g3 24.g4 or 24.Qxe5?? were the only ways to prevent this threat.  Now it is mate in one after 24.Qxg2#.
27,0,27,2Qxg2#,b'2k4r/1pp2p2/p1bp4/4n3/2P5/7P/P1P1QPq1/R3R1K1 w - -',I think that you will play better if you are aggressive because it gives you the chance to see through your opponents weakness even if it means loosing. If you do not play aggressive however it is unlikely that you will play well even if you win. That is because you can become lackadasical and it might cause you to ignore the position. BTW this another example of where psychology thought process and cognition all play a role in my games. For example I believe that playing aggressively helps you to control the center.  In my game against Master elyhim he said that it often appears that I ignore the center. Why did he think that?  It is because I was too passive (not the other way around).  Therefore it almost appeared that the center did not even matter to me.  When I act aggressive however I do everything I can to control the center even if it means threatening mate or capturing the Queen. Then I develop immediately after the opponent spots the threat. That usually enables me to control the center.   
28,1,0,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',the idea of this variation with the move 5. f3 without Be3 or Bc4 is  not showing black where the LSB will move on the future white can play 6.Bc4-g6.7.Be3-Bg7.8.Qd2-Nc6.9.Nc3-Qa510.0-0-0 and go to the Yugoslavian attack or 6.Be3-g6.7.Qd2-Bg7.8.Nc3-0-0.9.0-0-0 -d5 and so on ...  actually this variation as we saw gives white to choose the variation that he wants to play however black doesn't need to change his game plane so it doesn't effect to much for me . there is another interesting thing here that white didn't play Nc3 yet so  its also big question where the knight b1 will move  however pieces development a quick as possible is one of the main keys in the game  especially in this variation .
29,1,1,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/1B6/3NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',i don't like this move  the pine on c6 doesn't effect so much on black i can easily block that pine with 8....Bd7! which i also developed my LSB on the same time  in the future i can run away(with the move 8...a6 ) his LSB or force him to exchange on c6 and i will get Bishops pare or if he retreats to a4 or c4e2  doesn't matter   white will lose some time on this unnecessary move 8.Bb5?! developing a  pieces its not enough  its need to developed to the right spots on the board . better was 8.Nc3 or 8.Bc4.
30,1,2,a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/1B6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',the miss placed whites LSB on b5 gives white tow uncomfortable choices  either he exchanges on c6 and stays without his bishop pare or  he retreats with his bishop and lose time that would harm him later on the  game .

65,3,5,Bb5+,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The standard plan of the GPA.
66,3,6,O-O,b'rn1qk1nr/pp1bppbp/3p2p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',6.Bxd7+ is also possible but I wanted to keep the tension between the two Bishops. Moreover I had played another game in which a similar position occurred (but Black had played ...e6 and ...Be7 instead of ...g6 and ...Bg7) and there the computer recommended O-O.
67,3,7,a6,b'rn1qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p2p2p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',A slight inaccuracy. Black does not like the tension between the bishops and forces my bishop to make a decision. But if I exchange (7.Bxd7+ Nxd7) his knight is not in a very good position. Had he played 6...Bxb5 7.Nxb6 a6 8.Nc3 he had had the choice to develop his knight to a better position (8...Nc6). It would be the same position as in the game after move 7 but then with the knight on c6 instead of d7 which is probably better for Black. Black's choice is less flexible for him (and more flexible for me as I could also have played 7.Bc4 if I had liked to).
68,3,8,e5,b'r2qk1nr/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2p1p3/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq e6',?! I don't like this move. It's a serious weakening of the central light squares my knight gets a nice outpost on d5 and the d6 pawn becomes weak. I don't think the g7 bishop liked to see this move either. More solid is 8...e6. White had 1:26 on his clock Black 1:14 (we started with 1:30 and got 30 seconds extra time per move so I had used 8 minutes and my opponent 20).
69,3,9,Qe1,b'r2qk1nr/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2p1p3/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Normal GPA development.

71,3,11,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/1p1n1pbp/p1np2p1/2p1p3/4PP2/2NP1NQ1/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',More defence for the knight but Black plays very passively and slowly while he does not really have the time for it. Better was to try and get some counterplay with 10...Qb6 as suggested by the computer.
72,3,12,1f5,b'r2qk2r/1p1n1pbp/p1np2p1/2p1pP2/4P3/2NP1NQ1/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I was not sure whether to play this or 11.fxe5. I chose this move because I can damage Black's pawn structure on the kingside and open up his king (if it castles on the kingside) next move. But probably 11.fxe5 is a more direct approach.
73,3,13,1Nf6,b'r2qk2r/1p3pbp/p1np1np1/2p1pP2/4P3/2NP1NQ1/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',I'm not sure what Black is doing he seems to be moving his knights around with no purpose. It's not that he makes very bad moves or anything but he seems to lack a plan.
74,3,14,1fxg6,b'r2qk2r/1p3pbp/p1np1nP1/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1NQ1/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I take to open the f-file but Black gets the h-file in return. I felt that my f-file would be more useful than his h-file but I'm not sure.

77,3,17,1Nxe5,b'r3k2r/1p1q1pb1/p1np1np1/2p1N1B1/4P3/2NP2Q1/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq -',! This nice little combination wins a pawn due to the discovered attack on the knight. Also good was 14.Bxf6! Bxf6 15.Nd5 with the threat of Nb6 forking queen and rook as well as a threat to the bishop so the ugly 15...Bd8 is forced when White has a strong bind on the position.
78,3,18,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1p1q1p2/p2p1Rp1/2p1n3/4P3/2NP2Q1/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Probably this is the safest place for the king.
79,3,19,1Nd5,b'2kr3r/1p1q1p2/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/3P2Q1/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Finally taking the outpost and threatening the royal fork Nb6+.
80,3,20,1Kb8,b'1k1r3r/1p1q1p2/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/3P2Q1/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',Moving out of the way so there's no check on b6.
81,3,21,1h3,b'1k1r3r/1p1q1p2/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/3P2QP/PPP3P1/R5K1 b - -',A safety measure because I was expecting a doubling of rooks on the h-file combined with ...Ng4 to attack my kingside. I did notice that after for example 18.Raf1 the immediate 18...Ng4?! would not be so strong due to 19.Nb6! when the defender of the knight has to move and I can take the knight next turn (e.g. 19...Qc7 20.Qxg4 Qxb6) but I thought this move would be necessary anyway if the rooks double up on the h-file. The computer doesn't think it's necessary though and prefers the doubling of rooks with 18.Raf1.
82,3,22,1Rh7,b'1k1r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/3P2QP/PPP3P1/R5K1 w - -',It seems that Black is indeed planning to double rooks. The computer wants to play 18...Qa4 19.c3 Qc2 to try and get some counterplay.
83,3,23,1c3,b'1k1r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/2PP2QP/PP4P1/R5K1 b - -',Preparing d4.
84,3,24,1Ka7,b'3r4/kp1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2pNn3/4P3/2PP2QP/PP4P1/R5K1 w - -',I don't know what Black is trying to do maybe he wants to defend the b6 square or step out of the diagonal of the White queen.
85,3,25,Nc4,b'3r4/kp1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2pN4/2nPP3/2P3QP/PP4P1/R5K1 w - -',I think 20...Nc6 wasbetter. Now the knight can be threatened again so it has to move to a bad square.
86,3,26,Nb6,b'3r4/kp1q1p1r/pn1p1Rp1/2pN4/3PP3/1PP3QP/P5P1/R5K1 w - -',?! After the game I said that I thought this was the decisive mistake. Now I can get the Black king into the free. Better was 21...Na5 which can eventually be followed by 21...Nc6 bringing the knight back into the game (didn't I say that 20...Nc6 was better last move?). 21...Na3 is not good either because of 22.dxc5 dxc5 23.Qf2! with the threat of 23.c4 when the knight will be caught with 24.Qb2 as well as the threat of 23.Qxc5 winning a pawn.
87,3,27,Kxc5,b'3r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2k5/4P3/1PP3QP/P5P1/R5K1 w - -',The computer suggests 23...Ka7 but that gives White an easy win with 3 pawns up after he takes on d6. 23...dxc5 was not possible due to the pin on the d-pawn.
88,3,28,2Qe3+,b'3r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/2k5/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P5P1/R5K1 b - -',?! Not best. I thought there must be a mate somewhere but there isn't. Better was to bring other pieces into play with 24.Rd1 or to open up the position further with 24.e5.
89,3,29,2Kb5,b'3r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/1k6/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P5P1/R5K1 w - -',?! Not best either. The king would be relatively safer on c6.
90,3,30,2Qd4,b'3r4/1p1q1p1r/p2p1Rp1/1k6/3QP3/1PP4P/P5P1/R5K1 b - -',Again I should have played 25.Rd1 or 25.e5.
91,3,31,2Qc6,b'3r4/1p3p1r/p1qp1Rp1/1k6/3QP3/1PP4P/P5P1/R5K1 w - -',?? Right idea wrong move. 25...Qc7 to defend with the queen was better. This blocks a crucial escape square and therefore walks into a mate in one.
92,3,32,2a4+,b'3r4/1p3p1r/p1qp1Rp1/1k6/P2QP3/1PP4P/6P1/R5K1 b - a3',? Somehow I missed the mate in one 26.Qb4# but did see the mate in two with 26.a4+ Ka5 27.b4#. Anyway I had won my first game and was happy with it. Hope you enjoyed the annotation again see you later for roud 4.
93,4,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian popular at all levels.
94,4,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Planning to play the Grand Prix attack (an early f4 against virtuallyh all systems Black can choose). The immediate 2.f4?! is not as effective since Black can immediately challenge the centre with 2...d5 and get an equal game.
95,4,2,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',!? A common move in many Sicilians. This is to stop knights or bishops from coming to b5 and to prepare a ...b5 pawn push for himself. I was not happy to see this move since I always play the GPA with Bb5 but that's impossible now (the grand prix can be played with Bc4 as well but I don't know those lines). Therefore I had to change plans already.
96,4,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Therefore I decided to switch to open Sicilians which I played earlier in my chess career.
97,4,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black can still choose some different systems for example the Kan or Scheveningen. This is a quite basic and flexible set-up for Black.
98,4,5,Qc7,b'r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3NP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Both players continue with natural development.
99,4,6,f4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3NPP2/2NBB3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq f3',?! And there we have the first of many mistakes made by me in this tournament. This simply loses a pawn. I wanted to prevent ...Ne5 but obviously I should have castled first before playing f4.
100,4,7,d6,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2NBB3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',?! Apparently my opponent didn't see it (he played really fast the whole game) or thought it was too dangerous. But if he had played 8...Nxd4 9.Bxd4 Qxf4 he would have been a pawn up. The open f-file and centralized bishop are not enough to compensate for a pawn in my opinion especially because Black has no weaknesses \and is very solid. With this move we get into a Scheveningen Sicilian.
101,4,8,1Rae1,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2NBBQ2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',It is becoming clear that White wants to attack through the center and on the kingside and that Black's counterplay lies on the queenside. Black's position is a bit passive but solid.
102,4,9,1Nxd4,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/8/3nPP2/2NBBQ2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',This exchange is a bit strange I think. I think Black should keep the tension between these two knights because I see no reason to exchange right now. I think something like 11...Bd7 or 11...b5 was better here.
103,4,10,e5,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3BPP2/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',? This must have been the point Black wants to gain more center control with tempo. Unfortunately it fails tactically.
104,4,11,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4PP2/2NBBQ2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',?! However I don't see it (I know this was not my best game tactically). Strong was 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.Qg3! after which the bishop can't be taken due to the pin on the queen while White has a strong attack on the e5 pawn which can hardly be defended (14...Bd6?? fails to 15.Rxf6! and the g-pawn is pinned so Black can't retake).
105,4,12,1fxe5,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/1p2P3/4P3/2NBBQ2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Opening the f-file for my rook.
106,4,13,1Bg5,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p4n2/1p2p1B1/4P3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Attacking the f6 knight and already foreseeing the following combination.
107,4,14,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p4n2/1p2p1B1/4P3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',Probably 15...b4 was better. The game could have continued 16.Bxf6 bxc3 17.Bxe7 Qxe7 18.b3 (18.bxc3?! does not win a pawn due to 18...Qc5+ winning it back). In the game I can exchange in more favourable circumstances.
108,4,15,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p4B2/1p2p3/4P3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Not quite giving up the bishop pair for free as we will see.
109,4,16,Bxd5,b'r4rk1/2q2ppp/p4b2/1p1bp3/4P3/3B1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',It was unnecessary to give up the bishop pair as 17...Qc5+ (which I missed of course) 18.Kh1 Bg5 would retain it but White's position is more active and you can't say that Black's bishops are doing very much in that position.
110,4,17,Be7,b'r4rk1/2q1bppp/p7/1p1Pp3/8/3B1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',Temporarily loses a pawn but probably it was necessary at some point to prevent me from sacrificing an exchange on f6 and opening up Black's kingside.
111,4,18,1Qe4,b'r4rk1/2q1bppp/p7/1p1Pp3/4Q3/3B4/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Black can't defend the e5 pawn due to the mating threat on h7.
112,4,19,Bc5+,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p5p1/1pbPR3/8/3B4/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Activating his forces with tempo.
113,4,20,Bd4,b'r4rk1/5p1p/p5p1/1p1PR3/3b4/3B4/PPP3PP/5R1K w - -',Regaining the pawn but allowing my rook to enter the seventh rank.
114,4,21,2Be4,b'r4rk1/4Rp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/5R1K b - -',? A bad move. I wanted to play d6 with tempo at some point but now Black has a good move to get back into the game. I should have played 24.c4. Black can't allow c5 because that would give me two connected passed pawns and I'm also threatening to win the b-pawn (the bishop is still on d3). So probably exchanging is the best option for Black. Now the c-pawn remains rather weak.
115,4,22,2Rad8,b'3r1rk1/4Rp1p/p5p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/5R1K w - -',?! Better was 24...Rae8. I have to exchange my active rook due to the pin on the bishop and after 25.Rxe8 Rxe8 Black gets the important open e-file and my Bishop has to move again while my active rook has been exchanged.
116,4,23,2Rc7,b'3r1rk1/2R2p1p/p5p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/5R1K b - -',I wanted to play Rc6 to help my d-pawn advance. Fritz suggests 25.g4 probably to gain some space and prevent ...f5.
117,4,24,2Rd6,b'5rk1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/5R1K w - -',Black stops Rc6 as 26.Rc6?! Rxc6 27.dxc6 would now leave me with an awkward pawn structure. The passed pawn on c6 is probably not as strong as it seems because it cannot advance (on c7 it can't be defended anymore). Fritz suggests 25...f5 to scare away my bishop and gain space on the kingside (and probably also to clear the seventh rank).
118,4,25,2Rd1,b'5rk1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/3R3K b - -','Rooks belong behind passed pawns' but White's passed pawn can't advance and has no help from other pawns. Therefore I should have played 26.c4 according to the computer even though my Rook has to leave the seventh rank after the pawn exchange. Note that I find this endgame quite hard to judge for myself so I'll sometimes just give the computer's suggestion and hopefully better players than me can give me some insights on the ins and outs of this ending.
119,4,26,2Re8,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/4B3/8/PbP3PP/3R3K w - -',I guess controlling the open file is important here.
120,4,27,Ba3,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/8/b4B2/P1P3PP/3R3K w - -',Starts an interesting bishop manoeuvre. Fritz comes up with the counter-intuitive 27...b4 which I cannot understand at all.
121,4,28,2h3,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/8/b4B1P/P1P3P1/3R3K b - -',I wanted to give my rook the possibility of moving off the first rank. It had to stay there because of the mating threat.
122,4,29,Be1,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/3R4/5B1P/P1P3P1/4b2K w - -',Fritz suggests 29...Ba5 but I like Black's idea.
123,4,30,3c4,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/2PR4/5B1P/P5P1/4b2K b - c3',Finally this move but at this point I think 30.g4 was better because of what follows.
124,4,31,3Bg3,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/2PR4/5BbP/P5P1/7K w - -',Hmm now there's a mating threat anyway. I think it was around this point that it became clear to me that the tables had turned and Black has the upperhand here.
125,4,32,3Rd1,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/p2r2p1/1p1P4/2P5/5BbP/P5P1/3R3K b - -',Probably 31.Re4 was also possible.
126,4,33,3Rc3,b'4r1k1/5p2/p2r2p1/3P3p/8/2R2BbP/P5P1/3R3K b - -',My time was running out here. I tried to make a threat (34.Bxh5 with discovered attack on the strong Black bishop on g3) but he wanted to play ...h4 anyway and this just forces him to do that.
127,4,34,3Kg1,b'4r1k1/5p2/p2r2p1/3P4/7p/2R2BbP/P5P1/3R2K1 b - -',Wanting to get my king out of that tiny corner but it can't get very far.
128,4,35,Kg7,b'4r3/6k1/p2r2p1/3P1p2/7p/2R2BbP/P5P1/2R3K1 w - -',Black is also activating his king and preparing a kingside assault.
129,4,36,Red8,b'3r4/6k1/p1Rr2p1/3P1p2/7p/5BbP/P5P1/2R3K1 w - -',I don't know the purpose of this move the rook went back a move later. Maybe he thought the rook on d6 wasn't defended but forgot about the bishop on g3.
130,4,37,3Be2,b'4r3/6k1/p1Rr2p1/3P1p2/7p/6bP/P3B1P1/2R2K2 b - -',? Closing off the e-file but probably I should not have taken the crucial decision to exchange my strong d-pawn for his a-pawn just before the time control. I create a new passed pawn but the pawn on d5 was way stronger than the pawn on a2 will be.
131,4,38,Rd2,b'4r3/6k1/R5p1/5p2/7p/6bP/P2rB1P1/2R2K2 w - -',White's forces lack coordination and Black is much more active. Black must be better here. Fritz suggests 39...Kh6 probably to be able to attack with the pawns on the kingside.
132,4,39,Rde3,b'4r3/6k1/R5p1/5p2/7p/4r1bP/P3B1P1/2R2K2 w - -',The last move before the time control (my opponent had forgotten to press the clock at one moment in the game so we had to play one move extra). I had made my 41st move with 2 miinutes to spare while my opponent had barely used an hour for his first 40 moves and still had an hour left on his clock.
133,4,40,Re8e4,b'8/6k1/R5p1/5p2/4r2p/4r1bP/P1R1B1P1/5K2 w - -',I expected 42...Rd8 with the threat of 43...Rd1+! 44.Bxd1 Re1# and that's also Fritz' preference.
134,4,41,4Rd6,b'8/6k1/3R2p1/5p2/4r2p/4r1bP/P1R1B1P1/5K2 b - -',?? And here's the biggest blunder of the whole tournament (at least in my own games). I wanted to defend my bishop on the second rank but I should have played Rb6 and then b2 instead of Rd6 and then d2. Up to this point I didn't do a safety check before every move. After this game I was much more careful and I tried to check before every move if it failed tactically (of course I sometimes still forgot it).
135,4,42,4Rf4+,b'8/6k1/3R2p1/5p2/5r1p/4r1bP/P1R1B1P1/5K2 w - -',?? This is the moment of mutual chess blindness referred to in the game title. I didn't realize util after the game what a big blunder I had just made and how lucky I was to have gotten away with it. The only good choice was 43...Bxd6 44.resigns.
136,4,43,4Rdd2,b'8/6k1/6p1/5p2/7p/4r1bP/P1RRBrP1/6K1 b - -',Actually this was exactly what I had in mind when I played 43.Rd6??.
137,4,44,Rf4,b'8/8/5kp1/5p2/P4r1p/4r1bP/2RRB1P1/6K1 w - -',Apparently Black thought there was not much to do on the seventh rank. He keeps searching for the right set-up of his pieces but meanwhile I am able to reorganize my forces and get enough counterplay to hold the draw.
138,4,45,Re7,b'8/4r3/5kp1/P4p2/5r1p/7P/2RRBbP1/7K w - -',This defensive move more or less ends all hopes of winning for Black. He could still try with 48...Be1.
139,4,46,5Rde2,b'8/4r3/5kp1/P4p2/4r2p/6bP/R3R1P1/5B1K b - -',Wanting to force another exchange because every exchange brings us closer to an ending with opposite-coloured bishops which would be a dead draw. I still had the feeling that Black was more active so I was worse and a draw would be a good result for me. Fritz suggests the line 51.Rd1 Re1 52.Raa1 Rxd1 53.Rxd1 Re1 54.Rxe1 Bxe1 with just the ending I was hoping for. Other 51th move alternatives don't offer Black any winning chances either because of my passed a-pawn.
140,4,47,5Re4xe2,b'8/4r3/5kp1/P4p2/7p/6bP/R3r1P1/5B1K w - -',And now it's clear that this will be a draw. If Black wanted to try something allowing me to exchange on e4 and then retaking with the f-pawn was the way to go. That would also give Black a passed pawn. But I don't think Black can win that ending either.
141,4,48,g4,b'8/r7/P4k2/5p2/6pp/6bP/R5P1/5B1K w - -',And here my oppponent offered a draw which I accepted. I didn't see a way to progress as long as Black keeps his rook on the a-file. Fritz says this move is an inaccuracy and suggests 55.Ra4 for me but I don't understand how I can have any winning chances here. Anyway I thought a draw was a fair result of this game because we both had had some winning chances (I was better in the first half of the game and my opponent was better in the second half). Overall I was happy to have drawn a player with 212 rating points more. The next game I played Black against an opponent with 1612 and that game will be annotated asap.

168,6,0,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',A standard Dragon position of the d6 Open Sicilian. This opening is well known for being one of the most aggressive and crazy openings in chess theory.
169,6,1,Bc4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ -',!? A different move order. Normal is 8. Qd2.
170,6,2,Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Another variation is 10...Qa5 11.Bb3 Rfc8 12.h4 adopted by Dragon exponent Christopher Ward.
171,6,3,Nc4,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/8/2nNP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',More common is 12...h5 13.Bg5 Rc5.
172,6,4,1Nce2,b'3q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/8/2rNP2P/4BP2/PPPQN1P1/2KR3R b - -',!?!? Totally unknown variation in the Dragon. White usually sacs a pawn after 14.h5 Nxh5 15.g4 Nf6 and White has the solid options 16.Kb1 16.Nb3 and 16.Nde2 or the aggresive options 16.Bh6 and 16.e5 however my coach has a materialistic mindset and did not want to sac the pawn.
173,6,5,1Re8,b'3qr1k1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/8/2rNP2P/4BP2/PPPQN1P1/2KR3R w - -',To prevent the exchange of dark-squared bishops.
174,6,6,1g4,b'3qr1kb/pp1bpp1p/3p2pB/7n/2rNP1P1/5P2/PPPQN3/2KR3R b - g3',?! The sac of the pawn was good but this move is not that accurate. Perhaps 17.Rxh5 Bxd4 18.Nxd4 e5 was better.
175,6,7,Nxg4,b'3qr1kb/pp1bpp1p/3p2p1/6B1/2rNP1n1/5P2/PPPQN3/2KR3R w - -',!?!? The first sacrifice. 18...e5 19.Nb3 Qc7 was much safer but I wanted to spice things up and realised this idea was still a plausible way to complicate matters.
176,6,8,Bh5,b'3qr1kb/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/6Bb/2rNP3/8/PPPQN3/2K3RR w - -',?? But now the blunder. 20...Bxe2 21.Nxe2 Qb6 22.c3 Rxe4 leads to a much better and balanced position.
177,6,9,2Nf5,b'3qr1kb/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5NBb/2r1P3/8/PPPQN3/2K3RR b - -',?!? 21.Rxh5 would have won on the spot but this sacrifice is also very interesting. After this White definitely has the advantage.
178,6,10,2Rxe4,b'3qr1kb/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5NBb/4r3/8/PPPQN3/2K3RR w - -',Also possible is 21...Qb6. Taking on f5 is suicide.
179,6,11,2Rxh5,b'3qr1kb/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5NBR/4r3/8/PPPQN3/2K3R1 b - -',!!? Another sacrifice! 22.Nh6+ was much safer but after 22...Kf8 23.Qd5 Re6 24.Nf4 Qb6 Black has increased his hopes of defending the position.
180,6,12,2Bxb2+,b'3qr1k1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5NBR/4r3/8/PbPQN3/2K3R1 w - -',!!!? A counter-sacrifice! If 23.Kxb2 then 23...Qb6 24.Ka1 Rxe2 and the board is on fire.
181,6,13,2Kd1,b'3qr1k1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/5NBR/4r3/8/PbPQN3/3K2R1 b - -',?! Accepting the sacrifice is probably better but my coach decided to be cautious.
182,6,14,2Qb6,b'4r1k1/pp2pp1p/1q1p2p1/5NBR/4r3/8/PbPQN3/3K2R1 w - -',?! 23...Qc8 was neccessary to remove the pin of the e7-pawn which then 24.Qd5 Qxf5 25.Qxf5 gxf5 26. Bf6+ is still better for White but Black can still hope to hang on.
183,6,15,Re5,b'4r1k1/pp2pp1p/q2p2p1/4rN1R/8/2N1B3/PbPQ4/3K2R1 w - -',? A mistake. 25...Re6 provides more resistance.
184,6,16,2Bd4,b'4r1k1/pp2pp1p/q2p2p1/4rN1R/3B4/2N5/PbPQ4/3K2R1 b - -',! The move that seals the advantage.
185,6,17,2Bxc3,b'4r1k1/pp2pp1p/q2p2p1/4rN1R/8/2B5/P1PQ4/3K2R1 b - -',1-0(?) I could have hoped to defend further with 27...Rxf5 28.Rxf5 Rc8 but the endgame should be winning for White. An exciting game of sacrifices and one of my most memorable games.
186,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The opening of this game led to a tactical battle early on and precise calculation skills were needed to avoid getting crushed. Using the correct method of calculation we can find the best moves in most tactical sequences and avoid blundering in those sharp lines. The full method of calculation is very difficult to point out so here are the essential tips for a good calculation. 
187,7,1,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',We should not need to calculate all the time. Most of the time when the pieces are not clashing we can simply make moves with only a basic safety check. We should also use our positional understanding to bring down the amount of calculation we need to do.
188,7,2,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',By the way we don't need any calculation since it is all theory.
189,7,3,c3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White is trying to control the center squares. His idea with Bb5 and c3 are consistent. Black now should try to develop and chase the b5 bishop away. 
190,7,4,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/4pppp/p1np1n2/1pp5/4P1b1/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',The typical idea taking extra control from the center d4. Now black is totally fine with white playing d4.
191,7,5,d4,b'r2qkb1r/4pppp/p1np1n2/1pp5/3PP1b1/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq d3',White does it anyways and this leads to a complex position where the tactics can start to arise.
192,7,6,e5,b'r2qkb1r/5ppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/1B3P2/PP3P1P/RNBQR1K1 w kq e6',Of course the best move and only a safety check is again necessary. At first sight white seems to stand superior-He has the better number of developed forces a good center and the bishop pair. However white is either now forced to close the position or he will have to defend his center and allow black to complete development. By the way the black c6 knight will have an outpost on the d4 square in the future so black should strive to trade bishops.
193,7,7,1dxe5,b'r2qkb1r/5ppp/p1np1n2/1p2P3/4P3/1B3P2/PP3P1P/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Taking is only one of the lines that ends up totally fine for black and it is complex but equal.
194,7,8,Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/5ppp/p1n2n2/1p1Bp3/4P3/5P2/PP3P1P/RNBQR1K1 w k -',Surprisingly the black king is safe in the center and furthermore all but one of his pieces the h8 rook is developed. 
195,7,9,Nd4,b'2rqkb1r/5ppp/p4n2/1p1Bp1B1/3nP3/5P2/PP3P1P/RN1QR1K1 w k -',Now we should have started to make a real calculation on this move. White can reply with f4 Nc3. He has other moves like Bb3 but they are not the best ones and we can see it with a quick look. After 15.f4 black has some candidate moves. 15...Nc2 Bd6 Qd7(since it makes a threat). These are the main ones. We see after 15...Nc2 16.fxe5 Nxa1 exf6 gxf6 its quite complex still. A deep calculation will take a lot of time and effort. So lets go to the others. 15...Bd6 loses cause its not safe 16.fxe5 will win. 15...Qd7 16.fxe5 Qg4+ is the best variation since after 17.Qxg4 Nxg4 black has too many threats and black gets a good position if white moves the king. 
196,7,10,b4,b'2rqkb1r/5ppp/p4n2/3Bp1B1/1p1nP3/2N2P2/PP3P1P/R2QR1K1 w k -',The calculation process is similar. Lets just go with the main line since there is so much. 16.f4 bxc3 17.fxe5 cxb2 18.Rb1 Ne6 19.Bxe6 Qxd1 20.Rexd1(20.Bxf7+ is a real blunder since it loses a piece) fxe6 21.exf6 Rc2 with some advantage for black. A huge pain to calculate since there are other lines but it NEEDED to be done before playing b4. I could have easily made a mistkae as well. There is only a positional advantage at the end as Well! 
197,7,11,1Qxd4,b'2rqkb1r/5ppp/p4n2/3BP1B1/3QP3/8/Pp3P1P/R3R1K1 b k -',This is a real blunder. I don't understand why white would give away the rook. I would have a nice  endgame with a b2 pawn ready to queen in the best variation.
198,7,12,Bc5,b'2rqk2r/5ppp/p4n2/2bBP1B1/3QP3/8/P4P1P/R5K1 w k -',Now white is simply losing.
199,7,13,Rb8,b'1r2k2r/1B1n1ppp/p7/2b1P1B1/4P3/8/P4P1P/R5K1 w k -',The rest will be a technical win and there is really no need to comment too much
200,7,14,2Bg3,b'1r4k1/3n1ppp/B7/2b1P3/4P3/6B1/Pr3P1P/2R3K1 b - -',White is threatening to play e6 his desperate shot.
201,7,15,Nc5,b'6k1/5ppp/8/1Bn5/P3PP2/2b3B1/6KP/1r6 w - -',We are ready to win the passed pawn. So white resigned.
202,8,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',In this game the game was based on a strategic battle based on a central pawn mass vs piece activity. Of course activity is the whole idea of chess and therefore black's strategy was more sound. There are very instructive ideas in this game.
203,8,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',White is playing a fianchetto so black blocks the bishop with a central pawn chain immediately. This is a typical idea. Here the black's light squared bishop is out of the game for now but black intends to free it later with ...b6 or better ...e5. Capturing on d5 will also free the bishop. 
204,8,2,Nc3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',It's a mistake. Now black can easily attack the knight and force it away while taking control of the center. Now his pieces are in better position.
205,8,3,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/8/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Of course we should use the pieces not the pawns. if we have a choice. 
206,8,4,e4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/4p3/2PpP3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - e3',This move really is another positional inaccuracy. White turns his light squares bishop into a prisoner and does not have a justification for it. White should simply go 9.Nd2 keeping his position in the center. However it is not so bad as it allows white to easily get away with having a worse development.
207,8,5,Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/4p3/2PpP3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Black wants to play on the queenside where he has more space. However an idea of playing on the kingside was also possible. The one with more activity can play on whichever side of the board he wishes to. 
208,8,6,1f4,b'1r1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1bn2/4p3/2PpPP2/3P2P1/PP4BP/RNBQNRK1 b - f3',"All the white pieces are backwards. Certainly black should take and open things up. Now here is an  understanding of when to move pawns that are not for developing pieces or stopping threats.
1.You move pawns when your piece activity is greater/equal to opponent's. 
2.Pawns are great to advance for an attack but not good to defend yourself. When the opponent has activity advantage you should keep pawns still. Here white does not understand this idea and black quickly starts an attack."
209,8,7,1a3,b'1r3rk1/pppqbppp/2n2n2/8/2PpPPb1/P2P1N2/1P4BP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',White makes another mistake trying to advance his queenside agenda. We should not advance pawns when down in activity. Probably 14.Qc2 getting out of the pin is better. Now there are more weaknesses in white's position to be fixed.
210,8,8,Nh5,b'1r3rk1/1ppqbppp/2n5/p6n/2PpPPb1/P2P1N2/1P1N2BP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Provoking white to advance his pawns again. Certainly white did not want to go backwards with 16.Nb1 so he must push the pawn. As we know it is bad when you are defending.
211,8,9,Qd6,b'1r3rk1/1pp1bppp/2nq4/p4P2/2PpPnb1/P2P1N2/1PQN2BP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black is tranfering his pieces to the kingside and will attack there. White has a lot of pawns advanced and therefore a lot of weaknesses. Not good when defending.
212,8,10,1b3,b'1r3rk1/1pp1bppp/2nq4/p4P2/2PpPnb1/PP1P1N2/2QN2BP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Another mistake this time because the move really does not do anything. 
213,8,11,1Nxg2,b'1r3rk1/1pp1bppp/2nq4/p4P2/2PpP1b1/PP1P1N2/2QN2nP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black is exchanging an important kingside defender. I'm not sure it was best now but there was definitely an idea there. However the f4 knight is much stronger than the weak bishop but the bishop was a defender.
214,8,12,2Ng1,b'1r3rk1/1pp1bppp/2n4q/p4P2/2PpP1b1/PP1P4/2QN2KP/R1B2RN1 b - -',White uses the knight for a defense as he should. This move is accurate. 
215,8,13,2Bg5,b'1r3rk1/1pp2ppp/2n4q/p4Pb1/2PpP1b1/PP1P4/2QN2KP/R1B2RN1 w - -',Honestly an exhanging of bishops at the right moment will greatly favor black. White has numerous dark square weaknesses so if he can occupy one with the knight he should trade bishops. 
216,8,14,Be3,b'1r3rk1/1pp2ppp/2n4q/p4P2/2PpP1b1/PP1PbN2/2Q3KP/R1B2RN1 w - -',Now if white takes black gets advantage his rooks will be activated along the center and will attack the weak pawns directly.
217,8,15,2Qe2,b'1r3rk1/1pp2ppp/2n4q/p4P1b/2PpP3/PP1PbN1P/4Q1K1/R1B2RN1 b - -',White does not know what to do in the position. There was very little for him to do. Black has a fierce grip on the position and has gotton his pieces inside of the white's pawn chain which has left many squares weak. More weak squares=More attacking chances for the attacker and therefore pawns need to stay where they are when you defend.

I hardly ever play the thing but looking for a change I had forgotten I had played recently in a Mini-Tournament with precisely this opening (the Panov-Botvinnik Attack withal).  That MT was not a success for me: 1 win 4 draws and 3 losses.
444,18,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The usual though 2.Nc3 is quite a good alternative.
445,18,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',With 2...g3 Black could turn the thing into a Modern Defence.  But this central challenge is the most often played.
446,18,3,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Exchanging is not the only method.  White also has 3.Nc3 (probably the most popular) 3.Nd2 and 3.e5 (The Advance Variation).  Interesting that these three are the most popular third moves against the French Defence as well.
447,18,4,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3...Qxd5 seems pointless.
448,18,5,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This is the aggressive Panov-Botvinnik Attack a line that has certain affinities to the Queen's Gambit Declined.  This is what I have usually played on the White side (steering for the Gunderam Attack) but here I have the Black pieces.  A good alternative for White is 4.Bd3!? - The Rubinstein Attack.
449,18,6,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Also playable is 4....e6.
450,18,7,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',My favorite line is 5.c5 - the Gunderam Attack.  The idea is at once to establish a Queen side (pawn) majority in the hope of [a] obtaining a past pawn or two  and/or [b] imposing a bind on Black's Q-side.  In the Mini-Tournament earlier mentioned this didn't work out so well though a game shortly afterwards (vs veldhuiazaria) went my way after a very tough struggle.
451,18,8,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',(!?) Herzog Defence.  I know 'Herzog' means 'Duke' but the temptation to an Anglophone such as myself is to mispronounce just a little: the 'Hedgehog' Defence.   Not that it's very hedgehoggy.  Slightly more usual is 5...e6.
452,18,9,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Jo opts for straightforward development though 6.Bg5 was a good alternative.

It does release the tension in the centre but leaves White with an 'isolani' - an isolated Queen's Pawn - sitting on a file half-open for Black's rooks.  On the other hand there is - or used to be - potential for White to develop a quick K-side attack by bringing the bishops to d3 and g5.   As it transpired White's pawn structure was of no serious concern until very late in the game.
455,18,12,Nxd5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3n4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Instead 7...Bxf3 has been tried but has not according to the Gameknot World Database proved very successful for Black.  Far more popular has been this standard recapture.
456,18,13,Qb3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3n4/3P2b1/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Now things get interesting.  White strikes at the centre but also towards the b7-pawn.
457,18,14,Nb6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P2b1/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Cautious though Black also has it in mind to play...Nxd4 subsequently.  An alternative was ...Bxf3 but as earlier mentioned I was having doubts about this.  The upside of this capture is the doubling of pawns on the f-file and White is left with her whole pawn structure shattered.  But I felt that the open g-file and more active game would have gone a long way to compensate for that.  But without exchanging on f3 the bishop sortie to g4 seems lacking in purpose.  So maybe ...e6 ought to have been played instead of ...Bg4 and then deploy the piece to d7.
458,18,15,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P2b1/1QN1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',White still has a range of options: 9.Ne5 or most often played 9.d5.  Against the pawn advance though Black's record has been quite good.
459,18,16,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P4/1QN1Bb2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',(!?) A big decision.  Fact was I couldn't find anything better and this exchange damaging to White's structure as it is makes a lot of sense.  But I felt that White received rather less harm than it looked by this; the bishops being very mobile pieces and Black's position on the Q-side looking rather fragile.  Incidentally according to the GK engine we has departed from 'the book' a move back but all this had been played before.  As it turned out we would transpose back in the 'book' a move later...
460,18,17,e6,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/8/3P4/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/R3KB1R w KQkq -','Book'.  But I seriously considered 10...g7 here.  This would have gone some way to neutralise the g-file but I was worried that it was too slow.  Of course if I wanted to develop the bishop scarcely any other move came into consideration.  But it is already late in the day for mobilizing Black's King side...

464,18,21,1exd5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/1nn5/3p4/8/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R w kq -',I spent a lot of time thinking about 12...Nxd5.  The few times it has been played in games on the GK Database have all ended in draws and it seemed to me that Black's prospects of getting anything better were pretty slender.  So: stay with the obvious and popular.
465,18,22,1Bxb6,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/1Bn5/3p4/8/1QN2P2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R b kq -',(?!)

Also coming into consideration was 13.Rg1 a move Black always had to watch out for.  Interestingly enough the Database indicated that 13.Bxb6 as played was the more successful in actual play.
466,18,23,1Qxb6,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/1qn5/3p4/8/1QN2P2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R w kq -',Taking with the pawn was an option but I felt that White really did get an edge after that.  Now Jo's rating is about 150 or so points below mine but she has improved greatly over the last couple of years or so.  Against such a player I'd rather keep things level with a high 'risk' of a draw than unbalance things with a significant risk of a loss.  Admittedly this makes the game win draw or lose less interesting (sorry) but perhaps more can be learned from it.  At any rate I've never taken Jo lightly and I'm not about to start!
467,18,24,1Qxb6,b'r3k2r/pp2bppp/1Qn5/3p4/8/2N2P2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R b kq -',Not unexpected.  To decline the exchange now would probably have presented Black with a tempo the initiative and the edge.  E.g. 14.Qxd5 Rd8  and now [A] 15.Qb5 Rxd1ch 16.Nxd1 (seems better than Kxd1) 16...Qc7  17.Ne3 0-0  18.Nd5 Bg5ch 19.Kb1 {not 19.f4 Bxf4  20.Nxb4 Nd4ch 21.Qc4 Qxf4ch and [AA] 22.Kd1 Rd8 or [AB] 22.Kb1 Qe4ch} 19...Qe5  20.Bd3 Rd8  21.Nd3 Qxb5  22.Bxb5 Ne5  23.Be2 Bf4 and a siege begins against the f-pawns; or [B]  14.Qe4 Rxd1ch  15.Nxd1 0-0  16.Qg4 Rd8  17.Be2 Nd4 with an attack.

470,18,27,1Bb5,b'4k2r/1p2bppp/1pn5/rB1N4/8/5P2/1P3P1P/1K1R3R b k -',(!) A very neat tactical shot even if it had been played before.  Not only is the bishop protected by a threatened fork (18.Nc7ch) but Black can not castle neither on account of 17... 0-0  18.Bxc6ch bxc6  19.Nxe7ch etc; or 18.Bxc6 Bc5  19.Bxb7 Ra7  20.Bc6 Bxf2 when Black doesn't have enough for the piece.  What to play then?  
471,18,28,1Kf8,b'5k1r/1p2bppp/1pn5/rB1N4/8/5P2/1P3P1P/1K1R3R w - -',(!?) The Database had 2 games with 17...Bh4 for a win and a draw.  Tempting except that I felt that the draw had been too easily reached by White.  The move I chose has a far less impressive scoreline: 3 draws only from 4 games; no wins.  Yet it seemed to me that the draws weren't quite so easily arrived at - there was more play in the resulting ending - and that Black could make something of an attack upon White's f-pawns in a double rook ending.  Nothing solid and in any case I was already just about prepared to write this game off as a rather uneventful (give or take White's 17th move) draw.
472,18,29,1Rhe1+,b'7r/1p2kppp/1pn5/rB6/8/5P2/1P3P1P/1K1RR3 b - -',We haven't reached 20 moves yet and it's already an end game - or will be very shortly.  Salo Flohr used apparently to describe as 'titanic struggles' the games of Grandmasters that featured a series of even exchanges until the handshake over the bare Kings remaining on the board.  For the spectator - who may have paid money to see the giants have at it - the absence of struggle would have come as more than a disappointment.  At this point I rather thought this game was going the same way and was regretting my choice of opening.
473,18,30,Kg5,b'7r/1p3ppp/1pnR4/rB4k1/8/5P2/1P3P1P/1K2R3 w - -',(?) Although the Machine (the Gameknot Engine) misliked this in favour of ...Kf5 I chose this deliberately to provoke the rook check on the g-file.  Oddly enough the Database had just one example for each move ...Kg5 leading to a draw ...Kf5 to a defeat!  I felt that for the loss of my own g-pawn my King would get in amongst his f-pawns and it would be White who would have to look for the draw.  Let's see how it panned out.
474,18,31,2Rxg7,b'7r/5pRp/1pR5/r7/8/5k2/1P3P1P/1K6 b - -',All this with a slight change of move order has been 'predicted' in the GK Engine's post-game analysis including Black's next... 
475,18,32,2f5,b'7r/6Rp/1pR5/r4p2/8/5k2/1P3P1P/1K6 w - f6',(!) Away Torpedo One!  Upon this pawn were pinned my hopes of a win.  Of course such a hope was fairly slender; White ought to draw fairly comfortably.  But it's not a gimme!  Even a stroll through the park requires a little exertion.  But as far as I was concerned I had the initiative; that was enough for me.
476,18,33,2Rxb6,b'7r/6Rp/1R6/r4p2/8/5k2/1P3P1P/1K6 b - -',(!?)  I believe it was here that Jo announced she was departing from known games.  Was this a mistake then?  No: objectively this capture is fine.  No damage to Whit's game here.
477,18,34,2Kxf2,b'7r/6Rp/1R6/r4p2/8/8/1P3k1P/1K6 w - -',Obtaining a passed pawn.  Probably White should now begin placing her rooks behind it - 26.Rf7 Kf3 27.Rbf6 Ke4.  This was what I had anticipated but it isn't easy to see how Black can progress against accurate defence.  But that's OK.  Playing for the win I was but the way the game had been going and was like to go I was figuring on a draw anyhow.
478,18,35,Re5,b'7r/6Rp/1R6/4rp2/1P6/8/5k1P/1K6 w - -',The right square for the rook.  All the e-file squares in the opponent's half of the board provide a safe haven for it.  Meanwhile I was not going to worry my head over White's b-pawn...
479,18,36,2b5,b'7r/6Rp/1R6/1P2rp2/8/8/5k1P/1K6 b - -',(?!) During the game I thought this was a slip by White.  That White ought to start placing her rooks on the f-file was becoming a matter of urgency.
480,18,37,2f4,b'7r/6Rp/1R6/1P2r3/5p2/8/5k1P/1K6 w - -',Stealing a march.
481,18,38,2Rbb7,b'7r/1R4Rp/8/1P2r3/5p2/8/5k1P/1K6 b - -',(?) Although the Engine's analysis passes this without explicit comment I thought this was a mistake.  Jo has much the same plan as I did: push the pawn to promotion and see where it leads.  But there is a critical difference between the two sides.  Black's King is right up at the sharp end where he can guide the lowly peon to greater things; the White King still on the back rank leaving his peasantry to their own devices....  One feels there is a political parable somewhere in there... :-)
482,18,39,Rf8,b'5r2/1R4Rp/1P6/4r3/8/5p2/5k1P/1K6 w - -',(!) 'To whom that hath shall be given; to who that hath not shall be taken away.'  Forget your political parables! Black abandons the h-pawn to force through the f-pawn.  Black must have the advantage now!
483,18,40,3Rgxh7,b'5r2/1R5R/1P6/4r3/8/5p2/5k1P/1K6 b - -',(??) This has to be the losing move.  No doubt Jo thought she had enough counter-play not only to hold but even to offer winning chances especially as she is now a pawn ahead.  It doesn't work out that way.  Instead the King had to come into the action though Black (with care) can maintain an edge: 30.Kc2! Rf6! {Not 30...Ke2  31.Rbe7 Re3  32.Rxe3ch Kxe3  33.Re7ch and now  [A] 33... Kd4  34.Rd7ch Kc5  35.b7 f2  36.b8=Q Rxb8  37.Rf7 Ra8  38.Kb3! (Not 38.Rxf2?? Ra2ch!) and the endgame peters out to a draw; OR [B] 37...Kf2  38.b7 Kg2  39.Rf7!! Rb8  40.Rg7ch Kxh2  41.Rxh7ch Kg2  42.Rg7ch Kf1  and 43.Kd3 or Rf7 hold the draw easily}  31.Rgd7 Rc6ch  32.Kd3 Re6  33.Rxh7 Rd6ch  34.Ke4 Rxb6  35.Rxb6 Rxb6  36.Rf7 Ke2!  37.Re7 f2  38.Kd4ch  Kf3  39.Rf7ch Kg2  40.Rg7ch Kxh2  41.Rf7 Kg2  42Rg7ch Kf1  43.Kd3 Ke1  44.Re7ch Kd1  45.Rf7 Rd6ch  46.Kc4 (46.Ke3 Ke1) 46...Rd2  47.Kc3 Ke1 and now the only way to prevent promotion is to give up the rook.  You can see from this that there is some intricate manoeuvring Black has to undertake to bring home the pawn after 30.Kc2!   
484,18,41,3Kg1,b'5r2/1R5R/1P6/4r3/8/5p2/7P/1K4k1 w - -',(!) By far the best move.  The thing is it took me a while to find it.  My first thought was 30...Rf6 and it is quite a good 'second best' move - good for a big advantage at any rate.  But I wanted to 'fast track' the pawn's career looking at ...Ke1 or ...Ke2.  Turns out that Black can resist quite strongly against those lines.  It was only after considerable thought I hit upon the paradoxical idea of moving the King to the unguarded file.  The King heads for an underground bunker at h1 impervious to White's rook bombardment.  What was wrong with 30...Ke1/Ke2 then?  White would probably have responded with this: 31.Rbe7 Rxe7  (forced: 31...Re8 32.b7! would have been disastrous - a WIN for WHITE!)  32.Rxe7ch Kd2  33.Rd7ch Ke3  34.Re7ch Kd4 (ducking by 34...Kf2 is good for White after 35.b7; nor is 34...Kf4 any good after 35.b7 f2?? {35...Rb8 holds the draw} 36.Rf7!!ch Rxf7  37.b8=Qcheck! giving White a likely win) 35.Rd7ch Kc5  36.Rc7ch Kxb6  37.Rc1 f2  38.Rf1 Kc5  39.Kc2 and White has the safe draw.
485,18,42,3Rbg7+,b'5r2/6RR/1P6/4r3/8/5p2/7P/1K4k1 b - -',This rook was chosen to check as it freed the b-pawn to advance.

487,18,44,3Rf5,b'5r2/5R1R/1P6/5r2/8/5p2/7P/1K5k w - -',(!) Not a chance!  Note that Black ignores the threat behind White's b-pawn in the interests of reinforcing with all the strength available the f-pawn - the key to the game.
488,18,45,3Rxf5,b'5r2/7R/1P6/5R2/8/5p2/7P/1K5k b - -',I don't know what Jo's state of mind was at this point.  I guess she had to try this as 33.Rd7 (preferred by the GK Engine) was a surefire loss of a rook for pawn and the game with it.  Possibly she still thought she had a chance as her pawn will be the first to promote!
489,18,46,3b7,b'8/1P5R/8/5r2/8/5p2/7P/1K5k b - -',Lunging forward.  Possibly she was hoping for this: 34...Rb5ch?  35.Kc2 f2  36.Rf7 and a draw.  That ain't gonna happen!
490,18,47,f1=Q+,b'1Q6/7R/8/5r2/8/8/7P/1K3q1k w - -',...with check!  At this point it was obvious that after  36.Kb2 Black could choose to play 36...Rb5ch; or 36.Ka2 Ra5ch  37.Kb2 Rb5ch; either way winning Queen for Rook.  I did spend some time wondering whether to play that line though I more than half expected White to play 36.Kc2 to avoid that exchange.  As it transpires winning the Major Exchange would have been the way to go for Black: 36.Ka2 Ra5ch  37.Kb2 ...{not 37.Kb3 for obvious reasons!}  37...Rb5ch  38.Qxb5 Qxb5ch  and now [A]  39.Ka2 ... {he can not land on a3 or c2 without a K-R fork}  39...Qd2ch  40.Ka1 Qd1ch  41.Kb2 Qd2ch  42.Ka1 Qc1ch  43.Ka2 Qc2ch  44.Ka3 Qxh7; [B]  39.Kc3 Qc5ch  40.Kb2 ... {40.Kd2 Qd4ch 41.Kc1 Qc3ch}  40... Qb4ch  41.Ka2 Qd2ch  42.Ka1 Qc1ch as in [A]; and finally [C] 39.Kc1 Qc4ch goes straight into [B].  The point of showing these lines is that after 36.Kb2 or Ka2 White loses the major exchange - Queen for Rook - and can not avoid running sooner or later into a K-R fork by the Queen.  But White chose to avoid the exchange of Queen for Rook...

513,20,1,c4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppnbppp/3pp3/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',Since black is not making the most active moves this c4 move is certainly justified since we are at greater activity than the opponent.

Black wants to play on the flanks and hold against any counters in the center. Thats why he set up e6 and d6. When the position is closed then his lack of development means little. So it is clear white needs to blast the center and start attacking there.
515,20,3,Ne1,b'r1bqk1nr/1ppnbp2/p2pp2p/6p1/2PPP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b kq -',The move activates the Be2 and prepares to open up more lines near the center. Here black should be consistent with his idea and play 8...e5 8.Be3. Now if black wants to force white to take he will have to play ...c5. But then white still has a nice edge since black has been forced to play in the center and it has gotton opened up a bit. So black's strategy is incorrect but if you don't understand it then you will not be able to counter it.

572,22,0,c5,b'rnb1k2r/pp1nqppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq c6',? A mistake which gives White a clear lead.
573,22,1,Nb5,b'rnb1k2r/pp1nqppp/4p3/1NppP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',! Pointing out that d6 is no more defended.
574,22,2,1dxc5,b'rnbk3r/pp2qppp/1n1Np3/2PpP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',Now White is up a pawn and Black has no compensation at all for the deficit and the bad King.
575,22,3,1c4,b'rnbk3r/pp1nqppp/3Np3/2PpP3/2P2P2/8/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ c3',! Opening even more the Black King position. White one is safe because Black is too behind in development to highlight it.
576,22,4,b6,b'r1bk3r/p2nqppp/1p1Np3/2nPP3/5P2/5N2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Now White can bring the Queen into play gaining a tempo.
577,22,5,1f5,b'1rbk3r/p2nqppp/1p1Nn3/3QPP2/8/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Now Black is completely lost but he will set up a quite funny try.
578,22,6,1Nf6,b'1rbk3r/p3qppp/1p1Nnn2/3QPP2/8/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',!? It is obviously a blunder but at least he tried something.
579,22,7,Qxf6,b'1rbk3r/p4ppp/1p1Nnq2/3Q1P2/8/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',?? OK now this is too much creative...
580,22,8,1Ne4+,b'1rbk3r/p4ppp/1p2nq2/3Q1P2/4N3/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Simple.
581,23,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Probably my opponent wants to avoid some lines (like the Budapest gambit) and plays 2.Nf3 instead of 2.c4.
582,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',I like to play the Benko against 1.d4 openings so I continue with my normal 2...c5.
583,23,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Unfortunately it won't be a Benko Gambit. This move is somewhat passive as it blocks in the dark-squared bishop but if White wants to avoid main lines and still wants to play c4 at some point this is a logical move.
584,23,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',I decide to stake a claim in the center as well. Now it's a sort of reversed queen's gambit declined but it can still transpose into other lines.
585,23,4,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pp4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I could play 4...e6 transposing into a sideline of the Tarrasch defence to the QGD but I don't know that opening so I decided to play different and try to avoid book lines...
586,23,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Putting pressure on the d4 pawn which will be the main theme of this game.
587,23,6,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Believe it or not but this game has transposed into a Caro-Kann Panov-Botvinnik attack. Compare it with the variation 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Nf3... It's the same position. I don't play the Caro-Kann and didn't recognize the position and my opponent was not aware of it either I think as he took much time to think at each move.
588,23,7,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',More pressure on d4. But the question is: 'Can I take that pawn or not?' I tried to calculate many moves in advance and already saw the game position at move 10.
589,23,8,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',More defence for the pawn. By the way the main continuation is 7.cxd5.
590,23,9,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N1Bb2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',? Exchanging a defender of d4 for a piece that doesn't directly attack it. I decided to go for the pawn as I couldn't see a clear refutation (yet). Even though I did see that White would get a development advantage I didn't think it would be enough compensation for the pawn. The variation was too long for me to see White's winning move at move 11. Note that this move in itself does not lose the game but the plan behind it does.
591,23,10,dxc4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/8/2pP4/2N1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Clearing the d-file for my queen.
592,23,11,Nxd4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/2Bn4/2N1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',?? Played quickly (too quickly?). Probably if I would have calculated now I would have seen White's winning move. But it's very hard to 'admit' that you have made a mistake and I kind of felt that there was no way back at this point. If I would not take this pawn now I would have lost the bishop pair and given White a development advantage for free. But anything's better than giving him the win.
593,23,12,1Bb5+,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/1B6/3q4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',! This wins. When I looked at this position at move 6 I thought about 11.Qxb7 and wanted to reply with 11...Rd8 'with threats to the exposed White king' (at first I actually thought it was a mating threat on d2 as I still had the bishop on f1 in my head). Of course 12.Bb5+ would also refute that variation (even if the Bishop were really on f1) but as said before the variation was too long to calculate.
594,23,13,1Nd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/8/1B6/3q4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',11...Kd8 fails to 12.Rd1 winning the queen or also 12.Qxb7 with a huge attack.
595,23,14,1O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/8/1B6/3q4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',12.Qxb7 was better and simpler but White is still winning. Maybe he didn't see that after 12...Rb8?? 13.Qxb8# is mate due to the pin on the knight. Also winning is 12.Bxd7+ Kxd7 13.Qxb7+ winning the rook on a8 or 13.Rd1 winning the queen.
596,23,15,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/pp1npppp/8/1B6/3q4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The best defence according to the computer because it unpins the knight But White is still winning at least a piece.
597,23,16,Qe5,b'2kr1b1r/pp1npppp/8/1B2q3/8/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',I saw the threat of 14.Ne2+ winning the queen and I saw that 13...Kb8 would simply lose the knight on d7 after 14.Rfd1. I also calculated a line with 13...Nc5 which went 14.Na4 b6 (only one to defend the knight) 15.Ba6+ Kc7 16.Qb7+ Kd6 and Here I thought 17.Rfd1?? would win the Black queen not seeing that the White queen was also attacked. But at all moves of that variation White has many alternatives which all win. But it does not matter what I play here as I'm lost in all variations.
598,23,17,1Rfe1,b'2kr1b1r/pp1npppp/8/1B2q3/8/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',And now I'm losing the queen anyway (14...Qc7 and 14...Qb8 fail to 15.Nd5(+) and 14...Qd6 and 14...Qc5 fail to 15.Ne4(+)). Moreover White keeps an enormous advantage in activity. Therefore I decided that I had seen enough and resigned. Quite a painful loss for me but fortunately I had almost a day to recover an advantage of playing one game a day. An interesting question that arises after seeing this game is: 'How to cope with variations that are very long and hard to calculate correctly?' There are in my view at least three solutions. The first is to keep calculating until you have come to a clear-cut conclusion but that's often not possible (due to time restrictions for example). The second solution is to just play it and see what happens which is what I did in this game but that can lead to a quick disaster as happened here. A third solution could be to assess the risk of the variation and if you find it too risky just not play it. In this case I could have seen that White would have 3 pieces developed against only one for me (an exposed queen which could be attacked easily) and that my king cannot castle and won't be able to castle safely in less than three moves (the e- or g-pawn had to be moved and the bishop and knight be brought out). If you have any other ideas please leave a comment. I would like to read your views on this. Thank you again for reading this annotation hope you enjoyed it.

He opts to reroute the bishop to a6 but perhaps it won't really change all that much. Possibly black had to try and figure a way to soften the kingside up with the pawns and pieces while keeping White tied up in the center. Whether or not that is even possible is hard to judge of course but as it stands Black's initiative is slowly disappearing.-CB

White gains material. What does Black gain? He gets an open f-file which in practice turns out to be an amazing tactical weapon against the White kingside (and often the king itself) and he gains center influence. White takes the f-pawn: Black has a center majority.

And also like in the King's Gambit this pawn structure (with reverse colors) is well known and the best weapon at hand is an immediate strike at its base: g4.

Moves like 5...Bf6-c4 which would be effective in other openings (we develop a bishop to take control of a key diagonal while pushing the knight on d4 away) are doubtful here: the knight would move to b3 and we would have to waste time defending or moving the bishop again which means White ends up having a ""free"" move to bolster his defences. The game move h7-h5 offers him no such luxury."
718,29,6,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2p1/5n2/5PPp/3Np3/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Like in the King's Gambit he cannot properly defend the pawn chain. It has to advance when pressed.
719,29,7,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2p1/8/5PPp/3Np1n1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',!? Bold. Possibly not quite correct but certain to cause him pause - at the least. Already White looks to be in trouble. His kingside initiative is well-nigh gone his development is off and the Black pieces are having all the fun. The white knight on d4 is powerless to influence the game and can be dislodged with little effort while the black knight on g4 is extremely dangerous. And all this for a mere pawn!
720,29,8,h4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2p1/8/5PPp/3Np1nP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',?! The GK computer evaluates this as a mistake preferring instead 7. f4 Bc5 8. c3 and an overall advantage to White based on the precarious position of the g4 knight. I may have gone with that but in my initial analysis I preferred either 7...ef (ep) or  7...e3!? with what certainly promises to be interesting complications.
721,29,9,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2p1/8/2b2PPp/3Np1nP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And now with the knight in place and threatening f2 we can develop the bishop: the knight cannot move from its post or bad things will happen to White.
722,29,10,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2p1/2n5/2b2PPp/3Np1nP/2P5/PP1P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Developing with more pressure on the center. White cannot take the c6 knight because of the weakness on f2.
723,29,11,Be2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2p1/2n5/2b2PPp/3Np1nP/2P5/PP1PBP2/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The alternative 9.Qa4 would completely displace the queen. The game move however gives up whatever influence White has left in the center in return for getting rid of the thorny invader on g4.
724,29,12,Bxd4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2p1/2n5/5PPp/3bp1nP/2P5/PP1PBP2/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',More center influence! Capturing here enables the knight to lodge on d4. I cannot in the situation think of a better place to have it. Giving up the knight on g4 - and an additional pawn - is a totally ok price for that.
725,29,13,1Bxg4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2p1/2n5/5PPp/3bp1BP/2P5/PP1P1P2/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! The logical follow-up to Bf1-e2. The GK computer labels it a mistake however giving 10. cxd4 Nxd4 11. Nc3 as the better continuation. The actual difference from the game is slight however and Black is easily better off either way.
726,29,14,1hxg4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2p1/2n5/5PP1/3bp1pP/2P5/PP1P1P2/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The pawn is lost but in return Black gains an open h-file. White has a potentially dangerous kingside majority though so it is important to keep up the pressure and don't give him any time to breathe. Black holds the center and as long as he can launch active threats through there White won't be able to do anything really dangerous on the kingside.
727,29,15,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/2n5/3p1PP1/3Pp1pP/8/PP1P1P2/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',"This center thrust is a very good move. It opens up for both the queen and the bishop it gives Black a very firm grip on the center and it threatens the f5 pawn at the same time virtually forcing White's reply.
However the evilly inventive GK computer came up with something even better: 11...Qxg5! The point? 12.hg? Rxh1+ 13.Ke2 Nd4+! 14.Ke3 Nxf4+ and the White queen is dead with Black a full rook ahead in the game. The best possible defence (GK computer) is actually 12. d5 Nd4 13. Qa4 Nf3+ 14. Kd1 Qxf5 but even then Black is a pawn ahead with a superior position."
728,29,16,1Qxg4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/2n5/3p1PP1/3Pp1QP/8/PP1P1P2/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',? I would probably have done the same but this is a mistake all the same. The queen is actually exposed there and by its mere presence it helps freeze the pawns (for instance there is now a bind on the f-pawn). White would be better off just sacrificing the f-pawn. Eg.: 12. Nc3 Bxf5 13. Qb3 Nxd4 14. Qa4+ Nc6 15. Qb3! and White will be happy to draw on repetition (which of course Black won't allow - he stands to win and should play like it!).
729,29,17,1Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/8/3p1PP1/3np1QP/8/PP1P1P2/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',There is no way this pawn could be defended and now White's camp is holed like a Swiss cheese. Black is a pawn down and White has an impressive majority on the kingside but Black's deadlock on the center completely negates that. Active threats against c2 and f5 in addition to the very uncomfortable weakness on f3.
730,29,18,1Na3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/8/3p1PP1/3np1QP/N7/PP1P1P2/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Forced or the rook is lost after Nd4-c2. Moving the queen back to d1 is even worse; this way at least White gets a piece (partly) into play.

735,29,23,1Ke2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp3p1/8/3p1bP1/4pQ1P/NP3n2/P2PKP2/R1B4R b - -',I expected this move and had prepared a little surprise for him should he make it. But the alternatives are no better actually. The center pawns coupled with the invading knight and bishop and the open f-file are deadly. For instance: 16.Kd1 d4! with overwhelming Black advantage eg. 17.d3 Bg6 -+
736,29,24,1e3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp3p1/8/3p1bP1/5Q1P/NP2pn2/P2PKP2/R1B4R w - -',!! A pawn and knight sacrifice which he cannot really refuse.

Rather better is 17. fxe3 Qe8 (threatens breakthrough into the white camp on either b5 or h5) 18. Qxf3 Bd3+ 19. Kxd3 Rxf3 after which White has a measly pawn and two light pieces in return for his queen on top of which his king remains caught in the center. Or to illustrate: the GK computer evaluates Black's positional advantage - in addition to his material surplus - as almost equal to an additional light piece.

In some variations of the french defence The winawer as example f4 is playd in a later state.. therefore i still replied with e6 with keeping the possibility in gaining that position open
905,38,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Still possible. But Also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation.
906,38,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Still possible.. But Also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation. However the moves that are played in the French defence looks legit on against this opening as well. 
907,38,3,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Okay well in the french defence the e pawn normally goes to e4 instead. So maybe its time to drop that idea for black. however as said before.. the pawn position that you go for in the French Defence also looks strong here. So I just proceed with that way of developing. 
908,38,4,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',At first sight this looks solid for white. However If I can brake up the center the black squares might become available for my dark bisschop. I believe we got an equal position here.
909,38,5,b3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/5P2/1P2PN2/P1PPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',b3 gives white the opportunity to set the white dark bisschop on the long diagonal.
910,38,6,d3,b'r1bqk2r/p4ppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/5P2/1P1PPN2/PBP1B1PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',"this moves makes the square e3 weak. So I wouldn’t be surprised if white wants to go for e4 and maybe even f5. However this migt take some time.. My dark bisschop is attacking the f4. When he plays e4 white will lose the defence on f4. I also want a to let my white bisschop go to a better square. I prefer to do so without blocking other options. Bisschop looks strong on b7 but on the other side.. there is a lot material in the way for that long diagonal. Also the knight on f3 is overprotected. On a later state I also want some options to do something on white queenside of the board.. therefore I do believe that the move a5 makes sense. If I can push that pawn fun further on the a file.. It might give white holes. If I get it to a3 it also might irritate white darks bisschop. Plus I leave the option to move my light bisschop to a6. 

It might be a bit odd to make the move cause the idea to make some brakes in the white pawn structure.. However.. to do that quick white needs to weaken his pawn structure a bit more.

911,38,7,Qe1,b'r1bqk2r/5ppp/1pnbpn2/p1pp4/5P2/1P1PPN2/PBP1B1PP/RN2QRK1 b kq -',hmmm now the queen is defending the pawn structure a bit less. I think whites idea is to go to g3 or h5 and attack on my kingfile. Specially when I castle. I do have enough faith in my own position to handle this attacking idea at this point. + I also need to bring my king into a save position. 
912,38,8,1Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pnbpn2/p1pp4/5P2/1PNPPN2/PBP1B1PP/R3QRK1 b - -',This move if you look at it it might look decent. The knight is developed now disadvantage point of it its blocking the diagonal but Nb5 looks like a good move for white.. I want to keep my dark square on the at this point silly looking diagonal. So I have want to avoid white knight to come to b5. easiest way is to play Ba6 here. But often I do prefer a counter attack
913,38,9,1Ng4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pnbp3/p1pp4/5Pn1/1PNPPN2/PBP1B1PP/R3QRK1 w - -',"If white decides to play Nb5 here anyways I simply take on e3 anyways. Attacking the rook on f1 and also threaten to play NXc2 and forking the queen on e1 and the rook on a1

The main threat is going for the e3 square here. Cause of black is attacking the pawn on e3 white probably needs to defend the pawn. Bd1 looks a bit weird.. Same as Nd1 both options will make the Rook on a1 looks imprisoned. Same counts for Bc1. but for Bc1 also counts that the strong placed bisschop left its diagonal.

914,38,10,1Bd1,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pnbp3/p1pp4/5Pn1/1PNPPN2/PBP3PP/R2BQRK1 b - -',I can understand this move.. White needed to defend e3. But Bd1 seems like an odd position for the bisschop. At this point look how important it was to play a5 instead of Bb7 right away. This saved me one tempo and Ba6 looks attractive now. 
915,38,11,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pnbp3/p1p5/3p1Pn1/1PNPPN2/PBP3PP/R2BQRK1 w - -',I can understand this move.. White needed to defend e3. But Bd1 seems like an odd position for the bisschop. At this point look how important it was to play a5 instead of Bb7 right away. This saved me one tempo and Ba6 looks attractive now. However the e3 square is defended by the queen.. I do have a center brake here cause of that.. the square d4 is defended twice.. 1 the Knight on f3 2 the pawn on e3. ( the e3 pawn has to leave the square that I want for my Knight ) I also uses the disadvantaged side of the whites 10th move (Nc3). 2 options here: Ba6 or the center brake.. Well easy decision for me.
916,38,12,1Ne4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pnbp3/p1p5/3pNPn1/1P1PPN2/PBP3PP/R2BQRK1 b - -',Here I think white blunders 2 pawn. Going for the exchange on e6 is to slow cause taking the pawn on e3 uses as a attack on the rook as well. 
917,38,13,Bxf4,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pn1p3/p1p5/3pNb2/1P1PnN2/PBP2RPP/R2BQ1K1 w - -',2 pawns up the centrum is mine and the Bisschop on b2 has lost functions here.
918,38,14,1Bc1,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1pn1p3/p1p5/3pNb2/1P1PnN2/P1P2RPP/R1BBQ1K1 b - -',logical. Now it has functions again.. Then again the moves has some disadvantages. If white exchanges on e3 I take back with my bisschop. The bisschop is placed strong on e3 and its also threatening a +exchange cause of the pinned rook on f2.
919,38,15,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b4pp/1pn1p3/p1p2p2/3p1b2/1P1PnN2/P1PN1RPP/R1BBQ1K1 w - -',hmmm .. Mayb this is not the best move.. Bisschop h6 might be better. Makes me able to defend the e4 with one more defender (pawn to f5 as a next move) a well :P 
920,38,16,1g3,b'r2q1rk1/1b4pp/1pn1p3/p1p2p2/3p1b2/1P1PnNP1/P1PN1R1P/R1BBQ1K1 b - -',thats for the second change to do that ;) Good thing that I have that idea at this point were it was missing on the previous move.. or maybe its just a lucky incident cause I'm forced to move my bisschop here.
921,38,17,f4,b'r2q1rk1/1b4pp/1pn1p2b/p1p5/3p1p2/1P1PnNP1/P1P2R1P/R1BBQNK1 w - -',And voilla. ofcourse white can play  g4X here but that weakens white kingside badly.
922,38,18,1Bxe3,b'r2q1rk1/1b4pp/1pn1p2b/p1p5/3p1p2/1P1PBNP1/P1P2R1P/R2BQNK1 b - -',The power of f4 is that the rook on f8 joins the attack. After this move white is kind a forced to play Rg2 to keep defending the Nf3 with the Bisschop on d1. Whites 11th move was a great move after all. 
923,38,19,1Re2,b'r2q1rk1/1b4pp/1pn1p2b/p1p5/3p4/1P1PpNP1/P1P1R2P/R2BQNK1 b - -',No!! thats a shame of this game. Position was really good for black but at this point.. black is 2 pawns and a piece up. Rg2 would also be powerfull for black cause of the Bb7. Plan was to play the weird looking move Na7 and Qf6
924,38,20,1Rxf3,b'r2q2k1/1b4pp/1pn1p2b/p1p5/3p4/1P1PprP1/P1P1R2P/R2BQNK1 w - -',"I can't blame Juva for giving up over here. He was down to much material. 

Finding the right moves after a game is of course easier then during the game. However you have a lot of time for every move your play and I do believe that white has chosen for a difficult reply on blacks move. Stills its not a bad idea to play games like this with white. You learn a lot from games like this.. And better test stuff like this out online then during an official match in real life.

I do believe that this games shows that it is hard to find the right moves for white. If black playd Ba6 on move 10. instead of Ng4 whites game would be a lot easier.. 

I find it fun and also a bit my style to play e6 against the f4. I’m not a professional and there are many stronger then me but still if you like the way I playd against f4 feel free to do so as well. 

Special thanks to Kneilca for looking into this game :)
