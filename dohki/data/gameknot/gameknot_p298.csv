0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',this all began on a sunny day in greece...as usual i started out with the French Ketchup opening.
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',he countered my french ketchup with a nasty little move not sure what this one is called but it doesn't smell like ketchup. 
2,0,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',ahh yes this is where it all begins i now bring in the guns his no name opener is no match for this ketchup master....watch as it starts coming down!
3,0,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',see here he is obviously scared by the ketchup covered beginnings that he is just moving random pieces at any given place with an open square hoping to distract me from my messy death hole with which i will place him in.  mmmm  yummy!
4,0,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',"i act with speed and pin his horsey.  for those who are just starting.  If he moves his donkey then i will snag a queen and then proceed by jumping up and down yelling ""ketchup is king"".  lets watch to see what happens!"
5,0,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/6B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',hmm.  well he didn't move his Q he must have seen my plans that i left open on my desk earlier today!   i'll have to stop doing that.  no worries i have better and bigger plans up my sleeve.  his Q will be mine!!!!!!1111
6,0,6,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/4P1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',i continue with my stern moves i am clearly at this moment trying to take over the center of the board which i have pretty much mastered at the moment.  and we all know that whoever has the center will prevail in the end.  so pretty much my opponent should just resign....long live the ketchup opener!!!!
7,0,7,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/2p1pn2/4P1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',well he's basically just giving me the center...this is gonna be awesome this is going to be easier than ramming my body head first into a pile of bricks.  I don't really see any benefit to this move I've searched and i could not find any references that claim this position.  though it seems that he is trying to free his Queen side castle.  lets see what happens next.
8,0,8,exf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/2p1pP2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',at this point i have decided that it was partial to my victory to take his horse figurine.   it was not completely necessary as this move is not out-lined in the ketchup tactics notebook but what is most important is that i am now at PLUS THREE in my score and he is still at zero.....i am winning!
9,0,9,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pb2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',from all my years of playing how could i have not predicted such a move?  i am stupid i did not realize that was going to happen.  it's okay though i am still at PLUS TWO i am still in the lead.  just need to make no more mistakes from here on out! 
10,0,10,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pB2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',I wasn't ready for this he struck me by surprise here i thought he was going to attack using his usual pirate ambush tactic which i was ready for which is why i pressured his black bishop with my black bishop.  he could have easily of backed off but he chose not to im thinking that he is trying to open up my king side and then hope to break my pawn forcefield ha ha like that will happen.
11,0,11,Qxf6,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pq2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',well now he's really in for a kick in the spleen.  I've had to result in bringing my queen out i did this for a reason i could have alternately moved my G pawn and captured his bishop but i am smarter than that.  He wanted me to use my G pawn so i surprised him and brought out the big guns.  he won't see this coming now im smooth sailing it's all pretty much downhill for him im hoping for a checkmate in under 10 moves. 
12,0,12,Bd3,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pq2/8/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',okay his bishop is now brought to the front line in an obvious attempt to attack my H pawn on the queen side.  instead of capturing my opponents D pawn with my Q.  notice his position as of now.  He has a direct line of attack all the way down on both sides of the board with his white bishop.  my plans are to slowly move all of my pieces to black squares.  how will his bishop attack if all my men are on black???!!!111  EXACTLY!!
13,0,13,d6,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2pppq2/8/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',so he wanted me to take his middle side pawn with my queen!  instead I step out my C pawn in an effort to clear out my king side to castle!  he thought i would take his pawn and once again i have out smarted him!  and at the same time i have landed yet another piece on a black square.  chess is all about multi-tasking i have mastered this feat.  i am almost always doing something else while playing chess sometimes I'm eating a pizza or a waffle.  Once i even took a shower while in the middle of a chess battle.  Yes i did lose that game but i have never lost while being SO clean.
14,0,14,d5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2pppq2/3P4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',This is where im starting to get scared.  even after i tried to scare him with my pawn brick wall he keeps pressing his D pawn forward.  i can only guess it's to try and penetrate my wall of pawns but for what reason?  He has no chance at victory.  Possible suicide maybe?  We can only hope!
15,0,15,exd5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/3p4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',with his previous daring move to penetrate my wall of stone hard pawns he wants me to swap pawns and i really don't have a choice this is probably his best move of the game.  the question is:  which pawn should i swap?  im sure he would like me to swap with my E pawn so i should swap with my C pawn.  But wait he knows that i know that he wants me to swap with the E which means that he knows that i will swap with the other one.  so his plans are being built on this single swap.  he is counting on me knowing what he knows.  so instead i will indeed strike with my E pawn.  completely knocking him off his feet and having to re-think his entire plans.
16,0,16,Qe2+,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/3p4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',at this point I'm starting to re-think my process.  Originally i was thinking this was going to be an easy win for me like all the rest of them have been.  His Q just placed me in check.  i can either throw my own queen in front of this assassin attempt OR i could signal for my whit bishop to pull the grenade launcher out and blast my opponent off the map.  
17,0,17,Be6,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2ppbq2/3p4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',well i choose to just wimp out and move my white bishop into play to block the punch.  
18,0,18,1Nc3,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2ppbq2/3p4/8/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',oh oh he's letting his horsey out of his stall.  now there's going to be horse poop everywhere.  Bringing the horse out doesn't seem to really do anything to me at all so i must keep pressing onward with my plan.  I still have several pieces that need to be moved onto black squares.  it's a slow process but in the end completely worth it.
19,0,19,1c5,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/3pbq2/2pp4/8/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',"perfect i have him exactly where i need him.  I bet he's gonna move his donkey again i bet it's gonna be in another ""L"" shape like his last one....he's so predictable!"
20,0,20,1Nxd5,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/3pbq2/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',i know his moves too well i study this guy like last weeks math homework i know how he works.   Right now he is targeting my queen on the not the king's side (queen side for the lay people).  and i can smell his horse feces already!  I have no choice but to retreat my queen. 
21,0,21,1Qd8,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/3pb3/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',"my king needs a little loving anyways we haven't had physical contact in like ......wellllllllll anyway!  so my guess is that he is next going to try and open up his queen side castle.  he's going to defiantly move his A pawn up two spaces to free his castle.



[SAVE FOR LATER]
his Q up against the front sidewall which in turn would open up my BFG (Bobby Fischer's Gap).  This type of move can only be managed by only the best trained chess players.  I doubt at any means that he will be able to pull this BFG off.  There have only been three recorded events of this being accomplished EVER."
22,0,22,1O-O-O,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/3pb3/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/2KR2NR b kq -',....or a queen side castle.....which was my second guess.    he always castles on the  12th move it's a given i don't even have to worry about him not doing it.  He has it built into his conditional moves to always castle on #12.
23,0,23,1Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/2KR2NR w kq -',"i proceed to engage my knight out of his nook and saddle him up for action.  notice that i moved him in the traditional ""L"" move much like my opponent has been doing.  I'm hoping that by copying his knight techniques that he will become intimidated and eventually just giving up that  or grab the nearest banana and stabbing it through his heartal area either one is okay."
24,0,24,1Re1,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pN4/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/2K1R1NR b kq -',he counters my knight speedy horse action and is seemingly stunned he begins to retreat his men.  first being his castle.  this is going better than i thought!
25,0,25,1Qg5+,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pN2q1/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/2K1R1NR w kq -',i again move with speed and attack his king his king has few possible moves without ending in a messy messy death.  I bet the life of a stranger that he'll move his king to the B2 square.  like i've mentioned previously i've studied this guy inside and out and i know how he ticks.  he will move his king.
26,0,26,1f4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pN2q1/5P2/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2K1R1NR b kq f3',BLASTED he's going haywire i could have never suspected this.  he's blocked the attack by my queen with his lowly pawn that is just despicable.  though he did not see that i could immediately remove his D knight from the board.  that will bring my score back to  1 YESSS!
27,0,27,1Qxd5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pq4/5P2/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2K1R1NR w kq -',and i do just that.  i bet he is crying with his face in his hands.  Life sucks sometimes.
28,0,28,1f5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/3pb3/2pq1P2/8/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2K1R1NR b kq -',he must still have tears in his eyes cause that was loser move right there after all of that he inches up another pawn.  I'm going to throw him off instead of moving my bishop out of the way of his pawn im going to leave it there i do this sometimes just to mess with him.  so now im just going to move my knight he's going to be so confused.  he'll probably start crying again.
29,0,29,1Rd1,b'r3kn1r/pp3ppp/3pb3/2pq1P2/8/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2KR2NR b kq -',he's moving his castle over to the d square probably hoping to get my queen by checking my king with his bishop.  That's not going to fly.
30,0,30,1O-O-O,b'2kr1n1r/pp3ppp/3pb3/2pq1P2/8/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2KR2NR w - -',i briskly castle my king leaving his queen snatching plans sunk to the sea.  his life sucks right about now.  he's lost all hope of catching up to my winning score of  1.
31,0,31,1fxe6,b'2kr1n1r/pp3ppp/3pP3/2pq4/8/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2KR2NR b - -',finally he takes my bishop with his pawn.  
32,0,32,1Re8,b'2k1rn1r/pp3ppp/3pP3/2pq4/8/3B4/PPP1Q1PP/2KR2NR w - -',to stop him from queening his pawn i quickly react and position my castle dude to stop him in his tracks.  That pawn is going nowhere.
33,0,33,1Qg4,b'2k1rn1r/pp3ppp/3pP3/2pq4/6Q1/3B4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR b - -',he's hopelessly trying to get the pawn to the top he thinks he is going to put me in check.  not so fast.
34,0,34,1Kd8,b'3krn1r/pp3ppp/3pP3/2pq4/6Q1/3B4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR w - -',i again reposition my king killing any chances of a check.
35,0,35,1exf7,b'3krn1r/pp3Ppp/3p4/2pq4/6Q1/3B4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR b - -',he's hit me hard and took my pawn i am no longer in the lead being at -3 i must act fast.  i need to regain my lead that i have kept during the entire game.  at the moment my castle is in danger.
36,0,36,1Qxf7,b'3krn1r/pp3qpp/3p4/2p5/6Q1/3B4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR w - -',almost without even thinking i move my queen in and remove the threat of his pawn.    I'm getting closer to my well deserved lead.  now at -2
37,0,37,2Nf3,b'3krn1r/pp3qpp/3p4/2p5/6Q1/3B1N2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',he brings his queen side horse figurine out.
38,0,38,2h5,b'3krn1r/pp3qp1/3p4/2p4p/6Q1/3B1N2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - h6',I decide to sneak attack him with my H pawn lets see if he sees this.  i doubt he will as it's so subtle if my plans go right i will be in the lead after i capture his queen with this lowly pawn.
39,0,39,2Ng5,b'3krn1r/pp3qp1/3p4/2p3Np/6Q1/3B4/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',dang he's good.  not only did he notice but he countered it with a classic twist-twist-double cut.  i have very little options here.  i must act fast my queen side queen's life is on the line.
40,0,40,2Qxa2,b'3krn1r/pp4p1/3p4/2p3Np/6Q1/3B4/qPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',i quickly think over all of my options.  i decide my best route is to move across the board and attack my opponents A pawn which in the end will leave me a direct shot to a checkmate after i finish setting up plan B which i can initiate after finishing plan A (aka project black square).
41,0,41,2Qc4,b'3krn1r/pp4p1/3p4/2p3Np/2Q5/3B4/qPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',he seems to think that he is going to block my queen in that hole i will not let this happen i am so close to winning this game it's not even close to funny!
42,0,42,2Qa5,b'3krn1r/pp4p1/3p4/q1p3Np/2Q5/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',i pulled my queen side queen down to A5 she's safe right now but at this point in time i am not able to predict my brother's move like normally.  there's some sort of mental block in my brain almost like he's hypnotized me...over the internet.  very strange feeling i must say.  and not even close to fair.
43,0,43,2Nf7+,b'3krn1r/pp3Np1/3p4/q1p4p/2Q5/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R b - -',man how could i not have seen this this is bad it's going to be hard to recover from this ofcourse i will be able to but it's going to be hard.  I'm now down a castle only one more left.  ehh i only need one castle anyway!  one giant house of stone is enough for this king.
44,0,44,2Kc7,b'4rn1r/ppk2Np1/3p4/q1p4p/2Q5/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',i didn't have many options here i chose to move my king as far away as possible. 
45,0,45,2Nxh8,b'4rn1N/ppk3p1/3p4/q1p4p/2Q5/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R b - -',bye bye queen side castle!  I love you.
46,0,46,2b5,b'4rn1N/p1k3p1/3p4/qpp4p/2Q5/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - b6',well now it's time for business.  I immediately begin to attack his queen my plans are just to bombard his pieces until he just decides to surrender he can only run for so long.  I'll give him three maybe four moves left before he decides he's had enough.
47,0,47,2Qxb5,b'4rn1N/p1k3p1/3p4/qQp4p/8/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R b - -',"dang.  didn't see it coming and it was right there in my face.  that's what i get when i try to play with my eyes close randomly moving the mouse around and periodically clicking and pressing key board buttons.  ohh well.

i've evaluated my position and it seems that the best thing to do is sacrifice my queen for his queen.  by doing this i will accomplish two things.  one i will make him think that he has an edge now (which I'm clearly in the lead) and he will loosen his game up and give me an even larger edge.

secondly im already so far ahead of my opponent that i could lose several more pieces and still have this game in the bag.  i don't need my queen it's just a pawn to me a large mutant pawn."
48,0,48,2Qxb5,b'4rn1N/p1k3p1/3p4/1qp4p/8/3B4/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',i proceed with my plan.  most likely my opponents next move is to take my queen.  i will start building my plans around this move.
49,0,49,2Bxb5,b'4rn1N/p1k3p1/3p4/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR3R b - -',i knew it.  he moved his bishop in my plans are right on track!
50,0,50,2Rb8,b'1r3n1N/p1k3p1/3p4/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',this is going to be good i tricked him now i have cornered his bishop.  his bishop is going to be in check no matter where he moves on the B row now.  i pretty much own that entire row now.  
51,0,51,2Rhf1,b'1r3n1N/p1k3p1/3p4/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR1R2 b - -',he doesn't seem to notice the threat that i have just created and seems distracted still by my queen swap.    he inches his castle out into the open what his plans are i am not sure but i am ready!
52,0,52,2Ne6,b'1r5N/p1k3p1/3pn3/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR1R2 w - -',I decided to retract my knight as he was in danger of death by crushing.  it's not everyday a big castle falls out of the sky and lands on a horse and crushes every bone in it's animal body.
53,0,53,2Rf7+,b'1r5N/p1k2Rp1/3pn3/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR4 b - -',wow that is the fastest moving castle i have ever seen.  i didn't even know castles of this period could even move.  that's just amazing and undoubtedly unexpected .  this is going to put a small kink in my plans.
54,0,54,2Kb6,b'1r5N/p4Rp1/1k1pn3/1Bp4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR4 w - -',i did what any man would do to save his life i ran from the scary castle.
55,0,55,2Bd7,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/1k1pn3/2p4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR4 b - -',the bishop is now in the picture again.  im actually starting to get worried.  i was ontop of the world and now it seems there is a small chance that i may lose this game.
56,0,56,2Ka6,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/k2pn3/2p4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2KR4 w - -',i disparately  try and weave my king out of this mess.  just like the brave slaves of my ancestors i must move north.   that is my plan.  
57,0,57,3Rxd6+,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/k2Rn3/2p4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2K5 b - -',well those things sure do come from out of nowhere i didn't even know they could move that way.
58,0,58,3Ka5,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/3Rn3/k1p4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2K5 w - -',north is good north is good north is good.
59,0,59,3Rxe6,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/4R3/k1p4p/8/8/1PP3PP/2K5 b - -',he seems confused.  this is my chance i must make a move.
60,0,60,3c4,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/4R3/k6p/2p5/8/1PP3PP/2K5 w - -',my pawns have been in training for months and are very skilled with hand combat.  i'm going to try and breach my opponents wall and check me a king.
61,0,61,3c3,b'1r5N/p2B1Rp1/4R3/k6p/2p5/2P5/1P4PP/2K5 b - -',and he stops me dead in my tracks.
62,0,62,3Rxh8,b'7r/p2B1Rp1/4R3/k6p/2p5/2P5/1P4PP/2K5 w - -',haha i took his last horse.  that really hurt him he's going to really feel this.
63,0,63,3Rf5#,b'7r/p2B2p1/4R3/k4R1p/2p5/2P5/1P4PP/2K5 b - -',"in check again.  i think that's all he can do.   he just tries to intimidate me with his checking abilities.  it's not even that hard to do.a

[EDIT]  dangit i tried to move and well it didn't work i had no spaces.  it seems he caught me by surprise again.  good game old chap good game!"

Moving the same piece twice in the opening is usually a bad idea but I should've jumped at the chance to exchange the Bf4.  Now while this pin looks dangerous since the g pawn is out of place that threat proves to be a phantom.

If you read my other annotation ""Willingness to change tactics..."" then you will recognize this as a sort of continuation on that same theme.  This game embodies a strategy that was brought to my attention through the annotations of andydufresne.  I'm sure that he isn't the first to describe or think of this but I feel the need to give him props for turning me onto it as it has helped me in many games since.

This game is just one of the more successful examples of turning initial won material into an actual win.

Disclaimer:
There were many irrational moves made on the part of my opponent (and on my part also) which made this win a little easier then it could have been but that's part of chess isn't it?  Taking advantage of your opponents blunders or lacks in judgement.  So please no comments about how these tactics would not have worked on someone who knew what they were doing.

Amazingly enough there are people out there that actually know less about chess than I do.  This is mainly for those people who are  at my level or below.  My hope is that due to my stated lack of technical knowhow about the game I might be able to offer some sort of understanding in a language that they can understand if for no other reason that I am working within the same scope of understanding as they are.

This is more of an excercise for me and also it may help someone of equal or lesser skill than I realize something they have never thought of before about chess strategy. Hopefully it will help me understand mine and my oppents play a little better also. :)"

This seems like a wasted move to me it puts a hanging pawn out there and doesn't do anything to attack the center squares.  The only possible move I could see following this would be a bishop move.. but he shouldn't have pushed it out so far.   It's as if he confused his 2nd and 3rd pawn move.  The e pawn should have been pushed out 2 spaces while the b pawn only should have gone out 1 if he was in fact planning a fiancetto."

My basic plan was this:

..p a6  planning...
..Kt c6
..p e5

The p a6 is a protective measure for my Kt move.  while white's hanging b Pawn is a weakness for him right now if I move my Kt to c6 he could move his pawn to b5 ruining all my plans.

the Kt c6 is move is designed to put coverage on the e5 square (to protect my future pawn move)

The pawn is then moved to e5 in order to initate more piece exchanging while the current move you're looking at continues to provide protection for my bishop.

Additionaly I was thinking that with everything else it accomplished moving my Kt would give me the ability to 0-0-0.

This is a sort of strange tactic for me and probably for a lot of you watching because now I have put 3 pieces in danger!  Am I crazy!?

I don't think so.

Keep in mind that White is still one move away from being mated.  With this move I continue to postpone his plans to take my Queen unless he would like to trade Queens which most players that I play (read: of my ranking) are unwilling to do unless they have no other choice.

I'm remember White's first few moves and so it's not a far stretch to assume that maybe he will take the bait and recapture with his Queen allowing me to checkmate.  

His only other options are to take my Queen with his Knight allowing me to take his Q with my bishop.. he would take back with his King (regaining his bishop and I would still be up my 2 points in material.

Rkxe5 which puts my rook in the center of the board gaurded by my Kt at c6.

Out of the squares that he can move his Kt only 7 are available to him:

f4 is occupied by his King so he can't move there
g5 leads to bxKt Kxb.. an even exchange
d4 leads to Ktxkt
c5 leads to PxKt7
capture the pawn on c7 will lead to KxKt
d8 and f8 lead to the obvious RkxKt
and g7 lets him attack my e rook (temporarily)

This leads me to assume that he will move to g4 in order to avoid trading his Kt for anything whether it's equal or not.  One of the advantages I've noticed about this strategy is that it sort of has a nice momentum that can be built from it in the sense that the move pieces that you trade off the more and more reluctant your oppenent becomes when it comes to trading meaning that often they spend more time trying to save their few remaining pieces then they do attacking."

Another interesting thing I find about this strategy is that often your opponent will not realize what you are doing and think that you are in the same mindset as he (trying to save what few pieces you have left).

This move obviously says that he has no idea what it is I'm doing."

White resigned at this point.

In the last annotation I did involving this strategy I was not actively pursuing the win this way I was only *willing* to do it if I had to.  This game is closer to the original annotated game by andydufresne that has inspired me to look at chess from this angle in that from early on in the game my main focus was to trade off material in order to turn my intial material lead into a win.

Comments are appreciated! :)"

If this helps you understand something that's great because it was educational to me.  If there is something erroneous in this annotation that might confuse or lead people astray in their strategy please comment about it.  Enjoy!

Here is a short example of the importance of recognizing threats against your weak squares and also recognizing when weaknesses are not fully protetected by your opponent.

This game proceed fairly regularly until move 4 where White leaves the generally recognized series of moves.  by move 5 Black sees an oppurtunity to exploit a weakness at Whites f3 which becomes the star of the game.

White's failure to fully acknowledge this threat and Black's ability to follow through with the attack are good examples of what both sides should watch for in their own play and their opponent's.

This is an instance where someone plays a move that I don't recognize from any of the standard openings I have studied.  At this point if there is no obvious threat a player can usually assume (in casual play) that the move is inferior and begin to examine the weaknesses.

For one it will be impossible to take Black's Knight without an even exchange and unless White's plan is to dismantle Black's Kingside pawn structure this is not extremely useful.

This move does nothing to address the 3 threats present on the board which are ..Pd5

With this move Black figures that white can't take his pawn because that would lead to a free Bishop for Black.

However this weak move only helps black strengthen his position on the board.

Again I believe this all goes back to making the Kt/B exchange giving Black control over f2 the second part of the problem was that White either;

a) never saw the threat

Although white had a considerable advantage at first now the best white can do is play for a draw. Heres why: 27..Nxd4! 28.cxd4 c3! Now white is forced to play 29.Qxe6  and keep black in perpetual check so as to avoid a major loss of material. For example the only other move which does not allow mate is 29.Bxc3. This would be followed by 29..Bf5 (but not Qxc3 which allows 30.Qxe6 draw) 30.Qxf5 Qxc3 31.Qc2 Qxa1 and black is winning.

However if white had played almost anything other than 27.g3 like 27.a4 then 27..Nxd4 would not have worked because 28.cxd4 c3 29.Qxe6 Kh7 30.Qh3 and white simply takes on c3 on his next move leaving black in ruins."

But whenever someone exposes their king on an open board with a lot of pieces they're likely to get mated anyway.
733,24,22,1Qh5+,b'r1bq1r2/p2p1pp1/1pn1p1k1/4P1PQ/3P4/2P5/P4PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I didn't calculate this forced mate possibility when I sacrificed my bishop I only calculated if Black goes to g8. I simply knew that there had to be a forced mate if Black exposes his king this early in the game so there wasn't much need for calculation although I probably should've calculated just to be safe but whatever mate is mate calculated or uncalculated.

Again just my inexperianced thoughts.  this was my first move.. I think it's pretty popular. ;)"
739,25,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Keep in mind that this is a trap you can set if you play black and the great thing about it is that it involves pretty normal looking moves to set up.  Like this one.

The main point here is that so far we haven't deviated that far from things you could possibly see in actual play.  Even though I found out that this move is actually an inferior move to many other choices."

KtxKt .. Pd5 (which forks White's Bishop and Knight).  This tends to go the path of:

Bd3 .. PxKt
BxP .. Bd6
0-0 .. 0-0

Which ends up with equality but with good play black probably has the advantage.  However considering that the standard series of moves leads to equality the following series of moves could work out to be even better.

This is the one move that I don't quite understand... one explination is probably that Black was not thinking of the ""trap"" at this point.  He is most likely getting ready to fiancetto his Light Bishop."

At the moment White has Black's Queen pinned and now has his own Queen protected.  Black can't castle without losing his Queen so it's reasonable for White to assume that he might be able to get an advantage in the future.

What follows is some random moves that could have happened.  Basically White is severly crippled after falling for this trap.

I would be interested in any thoughts some more experienced players have on this trap including but no limited to variations on how to get there and perhaps maybe some ways that White could get out of this trap at move 10.

Good luck and have fun!

Black sees that Ba8 Rec1 Bxc3 Rxc3 Nxe4 will leave him up a piece for a pawn so he jumps at the chance to take a piece while forking my rooks so that he'll end up with an extra rook once the smoke clears. But Black has underestimated my queenside attack tactics against his exposed king.

Now there are a lot of winning lines for me. Obviously (Kd8 b8=Q#) and (Kd8 b8=R#) are ones and (Kxb7 Reb1  Kc8 Qa6  Kd8 Rb8#) is a less obvious one and (Kxb7 Reb1  Ka7 Bxc6  Bxa1 Rxa1  Kb8 Ra8#) is an even less obvious one.

Black probably expects me to take the piece but that will only result in the end to my mating attack and I'll end up down an exchange (my rook for his bishop). I have a much better move here that is more brilliant and wins immediately.

Black didn't even get a chance to take one of my rooks because of all my tactics. So this game shows not to worry about material in the opening phase of the game. Material is only important in the endgame where it is easier to exploit.

This is a bad move and I'd like to think that the whole game is just showing how much lose of two tempi effects in the Dragon.

In the line with 9.Bc4 black often want's to exchange it by ...Ne5 and after white had played Bb3 only then force the exchange with ...Nc4."

my problem with this move (fxe6) is i have now given you a passed pawn on e4... this is particularly difficult for me to accept simply because it shows i made mistakes to allow doubled-up pawns to work to your advantage as opposed to your disadvantage... i'm not worried about the knight fork since Ke7 attacks both your rook and knight forcing the rook trade... can't really work out who's stronger from there i think we'll have a pawn race both queen and i'll still hold my pawn advantage... all other positions for me either allow you the pawn back or weaken my position further...>>>"

there is no immediate threat of you winning my rook which would obviously be a disaster for me... a rook trade would suit me certainly at the moment due to my king being more central... once my king is free to move in more my pawns are much stronger...

the other options are...

40 Kh6/g6 Rxh7

and you're king has been forced back a very expensive retreat... i will promote just before your king covers...

40 Rh6  Ke5

and the pawn is lost

40 Rh8 Ke5

41 Re8  Kd4

and the best you can do is advance though it will soon enough come down to a rook sac to avoid you queening then you have two linked pawns to worry about your king too far away and your rook alone unable to deal with both... despite being a rook down i will promote to win... if my pawns weren't linked then different story...

so you must trade or you'll lose... after that well you must be careful... i'm sure you can draw but one bad move and it's lost... every move from now on must be correct...>>>

<<<(Tugger) So... the game... classic endgame... there is only one move you can make that will not lose... first you cannot take my pawn at all... here the advantage of linked pawns at endgame is clear... you take my lower pawn and my other pawn runs off to promotion... that means you cannot protect your loose pawn either as that would involve moving your king away from my pawn resulting in unstoppable advance... you are in zugwzang... whatever move you make will be bad so you must opt for the least damaging move... so your pawn is lost for nothing... but that does not mean you are going to lose...

luckily your blocking pawn is on the knight's file... this means there is only one way to your pawn for my king... note if your pawn were on the bishop's file i would be able to bring my king around to your pawn via the rook file but your pawn is stopping me from doing this... if the pawn were a bishop's pawn then it would be a win for black...

so the only moves you can make to avoid promotion are either... Ke2 or Kc2...

but Ke2 will lose too... why...?

47. Ke2? Kxe4

48. Kd1 Kd3

49. Kc1 c2!

50. Kb2 Kd2

and now the promotion square is covered... note when i advanced my pawn i did NOT place you in check... this is the difference... the pawn forced your king OFF the promotion square... if i ckeck you when i advance then you can move ONTO the promotion square... then the only square i can move my king to maintain support for the pawn is directly underneath on c3... but then what would you move if i played that...? the answer... nothing... it is stalemate...

so...

47. Kc2! Kxe4

again you need to be very careful... it is vital you do not allow my king to get on d2 as this will allow me to promote... and you need to make sure i do not advance my pawn UNLESS i ckeck you in the process or else my king will get to d2... so again you have just one m"

or 48... Ke3 49. Kc2 and i can't get my king in...
so where is this win...?
48... c2! and this gives the black king a path to the pawn on b3... there is no need to explain the next moves as they are the ones made... please continue..."
945,31,71,4Kxe4,b'8/8/8/8/1p2k3/1Pp5/4K3/8 w - -',"and now i break it to him i've found the win...

<<<(Tugger) I have found a win for me... i thought this was a draw due to your pawn being on the knight's file but i am wrong... that means the rook trade was bad for you (though the actual trade was not the error that was forced it was checking me that was the mistake) as everything you did since then was correct your king had to start moving... anyway it doesn't matter as here is a lovely endgame position for you to analyse and see just how strong linked pawns are in endgame...

so... all moves will lose for you...

47. Kd4/c4 c2 and promotion wins

or

47. Ke2 Kxe4

48. Kd1 Kd3

49. Kc1 c2!

50. Kb2 Kd2

51. Ka2 Kd1!

49. Kxc2 (decline and i promote forcing you to take)

how well do you finish your opponent off when you have a won game...? i assume you have no problems with Q vs K or R vs K but if you would like i will be happy to continue to mate or at least mate next move before drawing this off and concluding our coaching game... i will promote to rook or queen as you desire... otherwise i will offer the draw after promotion...>>>"

In this game I play black and get myself into a really exciting mexican standoff situation in which it becomes a very tense game where the first person to make a mistake will lose.  Thankfully I was not that person.

The bigger theme in this game is one of sacrifice.  The more I play the more I realize that sometimes sacrifice can be a good thing.  I think it's important however to have a goal in mind when sacrificing.  In this game my goal was simple but I think just having some rough idea of what I was going for gave me the confidence to play more aggressively.  I think in this instance my confidence was complimented by White's stubborness not to give anything up so I was able to fortify my position because I was willing to accept a piece exchange when White was not.  This put white in a situation where he was constantly trying to defend and keep his pieces which eventually lost him the game.

I was thinking here of a game annotated by andydufrensne titled 'So how do you win a ""won game""?' in which he describes the process of being ahead by one pawn and deciding to trade all of the other peices off the board to essential clinch the ""already won game"".  

I was willing to trade Queens if that's what he wanted and then try to figure out how to evenly trade off everything else as depicted in andy's game.

He still has me in a pretty tense situation because I can not move my Queen.  However he is in the same situation.  I did contemplate initiating the trade myself but I wasn't completely confident that I could have orchestrated the rest of the exchanges as elegantly as andy.  I would only go that route if he initiated the exchange first the important aspect for me here is that I was *willing* to go through with it and had some sort of plan if that did in fact take place.

If White was thinking of a piece exchange most likely he didn't have any idea why he would want to do after it happened.  I also think that by my not initiating the exchange he thought I was trying to avoid it also.  So there are two perspectives going on.  He is tryign to defend his pieces and he percieves that I am doing the same but what I am doing is simply making sure that if we do trade that I will still come out  1 or more. 

This does however give me the chance to take his Kt at d4 which would also attack his Queen.  again my only advantage here is my one pawn.  The board position is pretty much equal as both of us can do nothing to relieve the pressure without trading equal pieces.

Again my advantage here was probably that I was willing to make the trades and switch tactics and perhaps he was determined to find a way out that did not lose him material.

It's possible that with some careful planning on White's part I still could have made a mistake that would have given him some sort of help (maybe f1 was a misatake for all I know).

But we'll never know because White resigned at this point.

I think the main thing that won me this game was my willingness to trade material with a purpose in mind.  Conversely what probably lost him this game (especially towards the end) was his unwillingness to lost material even for an equal trade. 

Maybe he saw my tactic of trying to keep a  1 and trade everything else off.. But even if he knew what I was up to from my point of view he passed up his best moves (which involved trading) in favor of inferior moves that eventually lost him the game.
