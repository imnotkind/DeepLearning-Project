Well I will now annotate this one.  It ended in a draw.  I was subjected to a mating attack on the kingside beginning with a central lock-up and then a pawn storm with the heavies behind it (there was just one pair of minor pieces on the board).  Glenda defending the e pawn lodged herself on Henry's home square as close to her other half as she could get.  My opponent apparently decided that Glenda did enough to rebuff the attack and offered me a draw.  Was Glenda's defence watertight though - you the jury decide!  Joanne

85,3,27,Re8,b'4rk1r/pp4b1/8/2n3pp/2qpB3/5PNP/PPP2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',I get my R involved.
86,3,28,Qa6,b'4rk1r/pp4b1/q7/2n3pp/3pB3/1P3PNP/P1P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',I did not want to expose the Q to the constant pestering by the Bishops and the Knight by moving it to the King side of the board. So I decided to put it in the least productive part of the board! Go figure.
87,3,29,Kg8,b'4r1kr/pp4b1/q7/2n3pp/P2pB3/1P3PNP/2P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',I really wanted to exchange as early and as often as possible and having K on f-file prevents me from exchanging Nc5 with Be4.
88,3,30,Kf8,b'4rk1r/pp4b1/q7/2nB2pp/P2p4/1P3PNP/2P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',He takes advantage of it and forces me lose tempo by retreating back to the original place. I really wanted to keep the h pawn supported by Rh8 hence no Kh7. Kh7 is exposed to the same diagonal attack by the white Bishop anyway.
89,3,31,2Nf5,b'4rk1r/pp4b1/q7/2nB1Npp/P2p4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 b - -',He is closing in on my King?
90,3,32,2Re5,b'5k1r/pp4b1/q7/2nBrNpp/P2p4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',Dual attack on Bd5 and Nf5. Plus I am thinking it would be good to get the Rook engaged here.
91,3,33,2Bc4,b'5k1r/pp4b1/q7/2n1rNpp/P1Bp4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 b - -',Pestering my Q again. Note that my d4 pawn is gone. Attacked by both Knight and the Bishop. More dangerously Bishop!
92,3,34,2Qg6,b'5k1r/pp4b1/6q1/2n1rNpp/P1Bp4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',Get both  Q and the R behind the pawn surge on his King. 
93,3,35,2Nxg7,b'5k1r/pp4N1/6q1/2n1r1pp/P1Bp4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 b - -',Very clever! I cannot avoid taking the Ng7 but note the a1-h8 diagonal is ruled by his Bf2 (Bxd4!). 
94,3,36,2Kxg7,b'7r/pp4k1/6q1/2n1r1pp/P1Bp4/1P3P1P/2P2BP1/R4RK1 w - -',I decided to move the King off of the f-file.
95,3,37,2Bxd4,b'7r/pp4k1/6q1/2n1r1pp/P1BB4/1P3P1P/2P3P1/R4RK1 b - -',It figures. My advantage is melting down. He has developed a very dangerous attack and my material advantage plays no role any more.
96,3,38,2Rad1,b'7r/pp4k1/3q4/2n1r1pp/P1BB4/1P3P1P/2P3P1/3R1RK1 b - -',Very dangerous move! BxRe5  discovers attack on my Q. This is exactly why I wanted Q out of that side of the board few moves back. 
97,3,39,Qxe5,b'7r/pp6/6k1/2n1q1pp/P1B5/1P3P1P/2P3P1/3R1RK1 w - -',My material advantage now is minimal. I am still thinking Q vs his no Q is a stronger position any time you can have it. I usually take that scenario with up to  2 material advantage of my opponent (Q vs 2 rooks and  2 material advantage for the opponent). I found out that a free Q roaming on the open board is a much stronger than 2 rooks and up to  2 material advantage. Off course this is just a rule of thumb but as this match shows all that can be useless if you are in significantly disadvantageous position. 
98,3,40,g4,b'7r/pp6/6k1/2nR3p/P1B3p1/1P2qP1P/2P3P1/5R1K w - -',I am finally getting the chance to start really closing in on his King.
99,3,41,3Rd6+,b'7r/pp6/3R2k1/2n4p/P1B3p1/1P2qP1P/2P3P1/5R1K b - -',Or am I?
100,3,42,3fxg4,b'7r/pp4k1/3R4/2n4p/P1B3P1/1P2q2P/2P3P1/5R1K b - -',"Opens up an f-file for his rook! f7 square supported also by Bc4. My King is in trouble! If I don't protect the f-file I am done (Say 34. fxg4	hxg4  35.	Rf7 	Kg8
36.Rd8  Qe8 37. Rxe8#)	"
101,3,43,3Rf6+,b'5k2/pp6/5R2/2n4p/P1B3P1/1P2q2P/2P3P1/7K b - -',He is not letting me even exchange hxg4 in peace! 
102,3,44,Ne4,b'8/pp6/6k1/8/P1B1n3/1P2q2P/2P3P1/5R1K w - -',Threatening with Nf2.
103,3,45,4Bd3,b'8/pp6/6k1/8/P3n3/1P1Bq2P/2P3P1/5R1K b - -',But that is useless now.
104,3,46,4Rf3,b'8/1p6/p7/6k1/P1P1q3/1P3R1P/6P1/7K b - -',I was so happy to gain all that early advantage I could not believe I found myself in this position. He has offered a draw at this point. His Rf3 is protected with g2. This rook protects b-pawn which protects the a and c pawn. I can't get my King anywhere close to his King to checkmate him. This is a draw! Wow. This realization hit me as a ton of bricks. However I was so upset with myself for allowing to get to this position that I really committed to analyzing every possible combination available.  I was going through hundreds of combinations which I won't bother you with here. However each time I found an opening I would also discover a well thought out counter play. However because there was a chance of a slip up I decided to continue attacking. Frustrated I declined the draw offer and plowed ahead in hope of a miracle...
105,3,47,4Qb1+,b'8/1p6/p7/6k1/P1P5/1P3R1P/6P1/1q5K w - -',First I try to trap his Rook in some kind of King Queen combo.
106,3,48,Qe1,b'8/1p6/p7/6k1/P1P5/1P3R1P/6PK/4q3 w - -',With this move I limit his moves to pawns and Rook only.
107,3,49,4Rg3+,b'8/1p6/p7/6k1/P1P5/1P4RP/6PK/4q3 b - -',I was considering 46. ...Kh4 but 47. Rg4  would just push me back. Perhaps I can attack him with Qe5 pinning his rook?
108,3,50,4Rf3+,b'8/1p6/p7/5k2/P1P5/1P3R1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',Nope that's not gonna work. He really has no choice but to play there. Any other pawn move and his Rook is pinned and done.
109,3,51,4Ke4,b'8/1p6/p7/8/P1P1k3/1P3R1P/6PK/4q3 w - -',Here I see an opening around his abc pawns! I am starting to develop the hope that this is a winnable match after all.
110,3,52,4Rg3,b'8/1p6/p7/8/P1P1k3/1P4RP/6PK/4q3 b - -',I would love to be able to pin his rook now with Qe5 but my King is blocking the attack!
111,3,53,b6,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1Pk4/1P3R1P/6PK/4q3 w - -',Changing the turn of the play forcing him to play Rg3 and then pinning him with Qe5.
112,3,54,5Rf4+,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1Pk1R2/1P5P/6PK/4q3 b - -',He is not cooperating again. It figures.
113,3,55,5Rd3,b'8/8/pp6/8/PkP5/1P1R3P/6PK/4q3 b - -',He is carefully avoiding the Qe5 pin and avoiding Rf4 Rg3.
114,3,56,Kb2,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P3R1P/1k4PK/4q3 w - -',I have gotten through his unpenetrable protection and I am inside his a-h x 1-3 rectangular castle. Can I get close enough to his King? That Rf3 has a protective wall around his King. Wall inside a wall! But I can't be stopped now.
115,3,57,5Rd3,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P1R3P/1k4PK/4q3 b - -',Again staying away from Rg3 or Rf4. This pin would either result in loss of the rook or having to move g2. Either one a losing proposition. 
116,3,58,5Kc2,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P1R3P/2k3PK/4q3 w - -',I am closing in on the safe squares for his Rook.
117,3,59,5Rf3,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P3R1P/2k3PK/4q3 b - -',Here also note that my K is attacking b3 in case Rook moves from the 3rd row. Which if I can find a non Q non K move I can force him to move away from the 3rd row. However I can't find such move. Perhaps I didn't consider a5 long enough?
118,3,60,5Qc1,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P3R1P/2k3PK/2q5 w - -',But I think this move should suffice too.
119,3,61,Qf4,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P2q2/1P4RP/2k3PK/8 w - -',Finally pinned! He was avoiding it long enough. It becomes a formality from this point on.... almost.
120,3,62,Kd2,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P2q2/1P4R1/3k2PK/8 w - -',Has to move the King now (more or less abc pawns are irrelevant).
121,3,63,Qh6+,b'8/8/pp5q/8/P1P5/1P4RK/3k2P1/8 w - -',His King now has to separate from g2 pawn.
122,3,64,6Kf3,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P5/1P3KR1/3k2P1/7q b - -',By using this side to side checking technique I get to move my King closer and closer to the g2 pawn.
123,3,65,Qh2,b'8/8/pp6/8/P1P2K2/1P4R1/5kPq/8 w - -',Rook pinned Kf2 is there and the game that should have been over long time ago finally finished the way it was supposed to after the early Q fall. However never would I have thought I would have had to fight for it like this. For all intents and purposes this was a draw game. It took only my relentless analysis and end game maneuvering to get the win. Hats off to cw40832! Thanks for giving me hell even after you lost the Q. I learned a lot in this match about the early development and positional advantage. I also learned (AGAIN) to not give up early and consider every option before resigning or accepting a draw.

White's dsb could go to h6 next move trapping Henry on g8 with the Wicked Witch dealing the death blow next move after that.  So Glenda pins her and at the same time makes Frere Leblanc a free man.

160,7,4,Qe7,b'rnb2rk1/pp2qpbp/2pp1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black is playing solidly but controls less space than White; White is far better developed - look at his bishops!

162,7,6,1f3,b'rnb2rk1/pp2qp2/2pp1bpp/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This move I suppose is solid but does little else blocking in White's previously well-placed bishop and queen while also removing what could have become a good square for White's d4-knight. Overall I think this move is pretty bad.
163,7,7,d5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nqp2/2p2bpp/3p4/2BNP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I wonder what White was planning after 14.exd5 cxd5 Bxd5. Well at least this move opens up the centre and perhaps the pawn sacrifice is worth it.

182,8,10,2Rhe1,b'1rq1k2r/3n2p1/4b1np/Q1p1P3/6P1/2N1B2P/PP6/2KRR3 b k -',Rhf1 to prevent Black from castling was an option but it loses the e-pawn. Notice the trap: 26...Ngxe5 27.Bf4 and Black loses a knight.

188,8,16,3Rxe6,b'r4rk1/6p1/1n2R2p/2p1n3/6P1/2N1B2P/PP6/2K1R3 b - -',On reflection...why on earth didn't I play 32.Red1 ? (The ? denotes a question NOT a bad move!)
189,8,17,3Kxe1,b'r4rk1/6p1/1n2R2p/2p5/6P1/2N1B2P/PP6/4K3 b - -',Again here I offered a draw which he declined.
190,8,18,3Kd3,b'r1r3k1/6p1/4R2p/8/2nB2P1/2NK3P/P7/8 b - -',I just need to play carefully and avoid any blunders.
191,8,19,Rxf8,b'5r2/6p1/3n2kp/8/3B2PP/2NK4/P7/8 w - -',Material is exchanged off - my attitude towards exchanges at this time was pretty tolerant.

214,10,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4. .......... Bg7 - some standard Dutch manoeuverings here!
215,10,2,e6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4bp/2pppnp1/5p2/2PP4/2N1PNP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',8. .......... e6 - both sides have now castled and I play e6 to keep my options open as to which of my pawns to advance at a later date.  Next move I play my pawn up to b7 and by move 12 the decks have been cleared between Glenda and my rooks.
216,10,3,e5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1n2bp/pppp1np1/4pp2/P1PP4/1PN1PNP1/1B2QPBP/1R3RK1 w - -',13. ........ e5 - it is the e pawn I choose to advance - this opens things up a little.

218,10,5,Nf8,b'r2r1nk1/1bq3bp/ppp2np1/5pN1/P1P1p3/1PN1P1P1/1B1RQPBP/3R2K1 w - -',18. ....... Nf8 - to prevent a knight fork on e6.  A plethora of exchanges is about to take place.
219,10,6,2Qg2,b'5nk1/1b1q2bp/ppp2np1/5pN1/P1P5/1PN1PBP1/1B4QP/6K1 b - -',24. Qg2 - eschews queen swap and puts pressure on c6.  A knight swap now follows.
220,10,7,Qd6,b'8/1b4kp/pppq2p1/8/P1P1B3/1P4P1/6QP/6K1 w - -',29. .......... Qd6 - after a further plethora of exchanges I move Glenda to d6 to maintain protection of c6 - this move also prepares a move such as Qb4 where I may swap my c pawn for white's b pawn splitting up the white pawns in the process.
221,10,8,3Qg2,b'2b5/6kp/pppq2p1/8/P1P1B3/1P4P1/6QP/6K1 b - -',31. Qg2?! - tries to renew pressure on c6 but I now force a swap of c pawn for b pawn.
222,10,9,3Kf2,b'2b5/6kp/ppp3p1/8/P1P1B3/1P4P1/5KQP/3q4 b - -',32. Kf2?? - I think this is the losing move as white had to block the check to avoid dropping his c pawn as well as his b pawn.  Whatever the jury decides here white drops a pawn.
223,10,10,3Kxg2,b'2b1B3/6kp/pp4p1/8/P7/6P1/6KP/8 b - -',36. Kxg6 - after winning a pawn I force a queen swap to try and win the bishop ending a pawn up.
224,10,11,3Bb7,b'8/1B1bk2p/pp4p1/8/P7/5KP1/7P/8 b - -',39. Bb7 - eschews bishop swap - if you go into K & P ending a pawn down you go into a losing ending - must be avoided like the plague!
225,10,12,3a5,b'8/1B1bk2p/1p4p1/p7/P7/5KP1/7P/8 w - -',39. ......... a5 - fixes a pawn on a light square - this pawn will drop off soon putting me two clear pawns up.
226,10,13,Bd7,b'8/3bk3/1p4pp/p7/2B5/5KP1/7P/8 w - -',42. ........ Bd7 - consolidation after winning my second pawn.
227,10,14,a4,b'8/3bk3/7p/1p4p1/p7/4K1P1/4B2P/8 w - -',45. ........... a4 - passed pawns must be pushed!
228,10,15,Be6,b'8/4k3/4b2p/1p4p1/8/pB2K1P1/7P/8 w - -',47. .......... Be6 - after this move Bob waves the white flag.  This technique is reminiscent of the technique I used against a 1753 player in one of Jo's Successful Endgames annotated a few months ago.  Frere Leblanc controls the a2-g8 diagonal.  Whether white trades bishops or moves the bishop away there is no stopping Glenda from making a reappearance two moves down the line and cleaning up the last two white pawns and turning her attention to the white king.  Hope you have had a good read!  Bye for now.  Joanne

277,13,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bb5 - this move is the start of the Nimzo-Rossolimo attack which had a similar start to my game Pawn Stab.  My 1900  opponent plays the opening differently however.
278,13,2,Nh6,b'r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p3pn/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',6. ........ Nh6 - this knight will go to f7 on move 11.
279,13,3,cxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pppbp/2p3pn/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',9. c xd4 - white has a pawn centre but can this be maintained?
280,13,4,1Bb2,b'r1bq1rk1/p3pnbp/2pp1pp1/8/3PP3/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',12. Bb2 - development nearly completed and it is when I play Qc2 next move.
281,13,5,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/p2qpnbp/b1pp1pp1/8/3PP3/1PN2N2/PBQ2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',14. Rad1 - after black played Ba6 on his 12th move I completed my development with my 13th and decided to centralise my queen rook to support my pawn centre.
282,13,6,1Ba3,b'r4rk1/p2q1nbp/b1pp2p1/4p3/4P3/BPN2N2/P1Q2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',16. Ba3 - after my pawn centre was busted a move ago I decide to pin and try and pile up on the d pawn.
283,13,7,1Bc1,b'r4rk1/p4nbp/b1ppq1p1/4p3/4P3/1PN2N2/P1Q2PPP/2BRR1K1 b - -',17. Bc1 - bishop retreats to home square - I now try to force a knight exchange on g5 but black stops it with h6 - weakening his castled position.  I note this but at the moment cannot find anything to attack it with.
284,13,8,1Qb1,b'2r2rk1/p4nb1/b1ppq1pp/4p3/4P3/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/1Q1RR1K1 b - -',19. Qb1 - Glenda moves out of the way of the black rook on the c file and I prepare to put a rook on the c file to negate the black rook's control at a later date.
285,13,9,2Nd2,b'2r2rk1/p4nb1/b1ppq2p/4p1p1/4P3/1PN5/PB1N1PPP/1Q1RR1K1 b - -',20.  Nd2 - this knight is making a tour to g3 hoping to come in on f5 or h5 to try and force an exchange of knight for dsb.
286,13,10,Qf7,b'2rr2k1/p4qb1/b2n3p/3pp1p1/8/1P4N1/PB2NPPP/1Q1RR1K1 w - -',24. ........ Qf7 - the Wicked Witch of the West foils my plan however.  Black now has a good pawn centre and a passed d pawn and a strong lsb.  Offset against it is a black isolani on a7 - also Glenda has a clear line from b1-h7 - I would lurve Frere Leblanc to be on the board here but unfortunately he ain't so I must think of another way.
287,13,11,2f3,b'2rr2k1/p4qb1/b2n3p/3pp1p1/8/1P3PN1/PB2N1PP/1Q1RR1K1 b - -',25. f3 - this move allows Henry to move to h1 if necessary.
288,13,12,2Bb7,b'2rr2k1/pb3qb1/3n3p/3pp1p1/8/1P3PN1/PB2N1PP/1Q1RR1K1 w - -',25. .......... Bb7 - this move allows me to contest the c file without worrying about my d2 knight being lost should my g3 knight be driven away.
289,13,13,Rde8,b'2r1r1k1/pb3qb1/3n3p/3pp1p1/8/1P3PN1/PB2N1PP/1QR1R1K1 w - -',"26. ........ Re8 and DRAW OFFER! or more pertinently for me 6 rating points are on offer - I decide to run with the money!  In a post match analysis Coach Ion had the following to say:-

""I don't know what you had planned for next move but Ba3 looks OK with the view of coming in at c5 after which a2-a4 and/or b3-b4 suggest themselves.""

So this is all worth noting if I find myself in a similar position later on.  For now I am a very happy lady and now get ready for Near-Expert Draw Part II. "

301,14,11,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1nppp/8/2b1N3/5B2/2PB1Q2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Presumably this is to try to make me move my queen again which means I lose tempo

However I look at the square f6 and my gut instinct tells me to analyse the board.  I therefore decide to exchange bishop for knight at e5.  This protects the c3 pawn for just one move.  I could have rounded up the pawn immediately but I think this is an improvement.  When playing through the analysis I noticed something else - the bishop taking on e5 also frees up the f6 square for my knight and bang we get a knight fork winning the g8 rook.  That is what will happen if black takes the f5 knight.  However I also noticed that when I played out dxe5 Nf6 - the checkmate detector came on!  Wow I thought.  I then set up conditional moves for both possible captures.  You can guess what black chose here can't you?

Two were against the same opponent - in fact this match was in the Barmy Army Mini-Tournament and in the return challenge which will be part 2 this opponent met the same fate!  The third game was an unrated game against a 1500  player.  Note the ratings.  These 2 players are intermediate players so this fate can befall anyone - usually this happens when you are so wrapped up in your own plans you overlook your opponent's and you find yourself down a king yikes!

This move is a mistake.  Why not protect it with your knight?  When you develop your Nb1 to c3 it will be protecting the pawn accomplishing 2 things with one move.  By using your bishop you reduce the potential of that piece which should be attacking the black pieces.  For some time the bishop will be dedicated to that pawn.  Later you will move the knight out to c3 and be able to reposition the bishop to another square in which event you have wasted one move.

Additionally the knight on d4 is now undefended.  This becomes a problem later in the game.

Zeque said he was in a hurry to castle and this move supports that.  True but what is the rush?  Especially in a game like this castling queenside may be a good idea."

The main lessons for this game are:
- In the opening be careful to assign the correct pieces to defense.  Usually the knights automatically develop onto squares that defend/attack the crucial center squares.  By using bishops to defend squares that developed knights will cover moves are wasted and weaknesses are created.  The white bishops in this game were never given a chance to really attack anything at all because the were busy defending.

-In the opening sometimes it is correct to move a piece back to from where it came.  For example on move 9 Nf3 was probably best.

Nxb2 which wins a pawn after 24. Rxb2 Nxe4 25. Nxe4 Rxe4.  I would then pretty much be forced to play Bc3 (to block the advancing c-pawn) allowing Black time to double his rooks on the e-file.  However I could then follow up with 28. b6! taking the DSB out of play.  But Black's best option is to hold off on any exchanges for now... the knight on d3 is powerful and in hindsight .. Nh5! is crushing since the knight will eventually be brought to f4 bearing down on all the weaknesses in my camp.

Given how the rest of this game has gone I wouldn't be surprised. It's very rare that I get chance to play an endgame of three lesser pieces versus the queen so I'm sort of hoping that he might.  

Another possibility is 29... Rd3 with the follow-up of Re8e3 doubling the rooks on the third rank.  During the game I had considered that Black might make that move and after a bit of OTB analysis I came up with a ""bait"" response of 30. Bxg7?!  The idea is that after ... Kxg7 I can play Qxc4 attacking the rook. Black can meet the threat with 31... R8e3 but then I can force a queen exchange with Qg4 ! or continue advancing the pawns with a5.  Material is now even where White has two pawns for the Exchange but with those pawns being connected and passing (and with Black's back rank undefended) I'd be feeling pretty good about my chances...

He too had used the Chandler book to learn it."
729,34,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The most vigorous response but it can lead to positions not at all typical of other Sicilian lines so I soon become uncomfortable.
730,34,3,a6,b'r1b1kbnr/1p2pppp/p1n5/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A mistake according to Matt: White doesn't intend to put his WB on b5 anyway so no need to discourage him.  Given my problems with my WB later in the game his advice to play 6....Bg4 makes a lot of sense: much more active.   As an inveterate Najdorf player I'm over-fond of ...a6.
731,34,4,Qd8,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1n5/8/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',and there's no need to retreat all the way to d8: d6 would have been OK.  If I'd compared my position more closely with a Scandinavian I might have considered this option as well as ... Qa5 and ... Qd8.

I assumed it was a waiting move and he confirmed this though it does have the purpose of preventing 13... Nb4 in response to 13. Qd3.  After the game we thought that an immediate 11. Bg5 was more direct and to the purpose.

I was already concerned about how I would complete my development.  Putting my B on d7 would cut my Q off from d4 and d5 and potentially if the Q went to c7 as it often does it would cut it off from the defence of e7.  Moving the b pawn to allow the B to b7 leaves the Nc6 undefended.  If I don't get the B off the back rank soon I'm going to have trouble connecting my rooks.  This becomes thematic in the denouement.
735,34,8,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1p2bppp/p1n1pn2/6B1/2BP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Nimzowitschean!  Over-defending the B and the e6 pawn prophylactically.  I resisted the temptation just to automatically push the B back creating  weaknesses on h6 and g6.
736,34,9,1Qd3,b'r1bqr1k1/1p2bppp/p1n1pn2/6B1/2BP4/P1NQ1N2/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Now I become concerned about the threat of Bc4-Bb3-Bc2 followed by Bxf6 and Qxh7 with probable mate to follow.  After-game analysis indicates that this was a chimera: after Bxf6 my e7 square is free for my K; and White's Q if it ventures to h8 will have to retreat ignominiously under threat from the Re8.  Consequently Matt had dismissed this possibility while I was worrying desperately about it!
737,34,10,1h6,b'r1bqr1k1/1p2bpp1/p1n1pn1p/6B1/2BP4/P1NQ1N2/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',but now I felt I had to force White's black squared B to make a decision.  I couldn't just wait for W to develop his attack.

In my previously mentioned delusion about the attack on h7 I thought W could ignore the attack on the N  and play 16. Bc2 anyway but later analysis suggested that he was right to respond with 16. Ne4.

Subsequent analysis suggested that this would have been successful: 18.... Bxd4 19. Nxd4 Qxd4 (I'd only considered Nxd4 at the time) 20. Qxd4 Nxd4 21. Nxb7 Nxb3 looks OK.  Other lines also seem OK for Black.  I failed to see far enough and blundered.

I really like White's development though having played this I'd be looking to follow with d4 as soon as possible otherwise the d pawn could become a liability. You also want to castle but there is no imminent pressure.
746,35,1,1Bxg7,b'r1bq1rk1/p3npBp/1pn1p1p1/1Npp4/2P1P3/1P3N2/P2PBPPP/1R1QK2R b K -',Why exchange if you don't have to? I'm not sure this greatly benefits White's position unless you have an imminent usage for the B1 rook that you want it freed up for.

You have no real choice now to either make D2 into an isolated pawn or to give me a solid spatial advantage in the middle. 11. exd5 exd5 12. O-O would have been fine I think and 12. d4 is probably an option.

I would have simply retreated to Na3 allowing Nc4 and some future involvement of the knight.

754,35,9,1Ned5,b'r4r2/p2q1pkp/1p4p1/1PpnP3/1n1p4/1P1P1N2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Instead of capturing the pawn I decided it would be better to get hold of C3 for my knight a lovely square for it to oversee your whole back two ranks. Because your bishop is on the white squares it will be very hard to shift for you and b5 isn't going to get defended any time soon.
755,35,10,Qf5,b'r4r2/p4pkp/1p4p1/1Pp1PqN1/1n1p4/1PnP4/1R1QBPPP/5RK1 w - -',It's far more useful to have the knight at C3 than to exchange for the bishop. It will be a pain for quite some time for you there. Instead I try to force the knight of its happy home by locking the queen into its defence and threaten the now undefended e5 pawn. If you return the knight I can simply add the rook to the attack and you cannot defend. 20.f4 would be very interesting though.
756,35,11,2Bf3,b'r4r2/p4pkp/1p4p1/1Pp1PqN1/1n1p4/1PnP1B2/1R1Q1PPP/5RK1 b - -',Good idea to free the file and threaten my rook except my rook will move to e8 and doulbe the attack. This has also removed the possibility of moving your f pawn forwards in defence. At this stage without my black bishop on the table I don't think you have to be concerned about opening up the diagonal and the positional strength it would have is quite significant.

761,35,16,Nb4,b'8/p5kp/1p4p1/1Pp2pN1/1n1p4/1Pn2BP1/3R1PKP/4r3 w - -',Positionally the game is extremely hard for White. Only 3 pawns sit on white squares greatly reducing the effectiveness of your bishop although your knight is very active and probably your best chance for any counterplay. With the e file gone to my rook and my knights in active positions it will be very hard to utilise your rook. E2 D3 E3 D1 C2 and A2 are all effectively removed from the Rooks positions making it impossible for the rook to get involved.
762,35,17,2Bc6,b'8/p5kp/1pB3p1/1Pp2pN1/1n1p4/1Pn3P1/3R1PKP/4r3 b - -',A nice idea I decided getting your knight out of the action was very important.

Sve je lepo odigrao ali topa još ne sme da uzme i to je pomalo iritirajuće. I to je upravo ono što će crnog kasnije uvesti u zamku. Ta fiksacija poteza Nc2+ koja dugo traje i sve vreme mami i opija crnog.
