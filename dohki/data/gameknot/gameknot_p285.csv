2,0,2,1Bxh6,b'r1bq1rk1/4npp1/p2bp2B/8/2pP3R/2P2N2/P1B2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',A typical sucrifice in the Colle.
3,0,3,2Nxh4,b'r1b2rk1/5p2/p2b3Q/5p2/2pP3N/2P5/P4PPP/R5K1 b - -',The game is over. Now white must care of the first rank and it must win.
4,0,4,2Rb1,b'1r2r1k1/4bp2/p7/5Q2/2pP4/2P5/P4PPP/1R4K1 b - -',This exchange is the simpliest maybe not the best.
5,0,5,2Bd8,b'1r1br1k1/5p2/p7/5Q2/2pP4/2P5/P4PPP/1R4K1 w - -',A trick. After Rxb8 Re1#
6,0,6,2g3,b'1r1br1k1/5p2/p7/5Q2/2pP4/2P3P1/P4P1P/1R4K1 b - -',Playing with patience.

9,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I had just met this opponent in blitz - we played an interesting game and afterwards he challenged me with the same variation.
10,1,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I seem to be coming up against this variation a lot. 
11,1,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',2 ...e6 is solid - I sometimes like to defer it in the hope of transposing into something like a Dragon.
12,1,3,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',....but white's attack on f7 can be troublesome and in this game I decided to cut it out.
13,1,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Transposing to an Open Sicilian. I head for a Paulsen type of formation.
14,1,5,d5,b'r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/2bp4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',Maybe I should have played ...a6  first. What follows although not frightening was not exactly what I had in mind.
15,1,6,Qxd7,b'r3k1nr/p2q1ppp/4p3/2bp4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I was not particularly worried by the exchange of light square bishops. In many variations of the Open Sicilian white lives to regret the light square weaknesses.
16,1,7,Bxe3,b'r3k1nr/p2q1ppp/4p3/3p4/8/4b3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I didn't really want to exchange dark-squared bishops but took the opportunity to isolate a pawn. I could have played Qc7 but I was anxious about  the fact that I was still two moves from castling.
17,1,8,1c3,b'r3k2r/p2q1ppp/4pn2/3p4/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I wasn't sure about this move. It may have been intended to strengthen the pawn liberating the queen from its defence - but in fact it turns into a chronic weakness.
18,1,9,Qb5,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/4pn2/1q1p4/3Q4/2P1P3/PP4PP/RN3RK1 w - -',The idea of the queen manoeuvring  here is to create weaknesses in the white pawn structure.
19,1,10,1b3,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/4pn2/1q1p4/3Q4/1PP1P3/P5PP/RN3RK1 b - -',Now the c-pawn is weak and will become a focus of pressure.
20,1,11,Qc5,b'r1r3k1/p4ppp/4pn2/2qp4/3Q4/1PP1P3/P2N2PP/R4RK1 w - -',"With the weaknesses on e3 and c3 and my rooks already moving onto the open files I didn't mind transposing into an endgame. I normally prefer tactical middle games but with both pairs of bishops off I figured a middle game was more likely to develop into a slow slogging match.
"
21,1,12,Qa5,b'r1r3k1/p4ppp/4pn2/q2p4/3Q4/1PP1P3/P2N2PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Of course not solving white's structural problems for him by exchanging on d4. I try to weaken the pawns still further.
22,1,13,Rc6,b'r5k1/p4ppp/2r1pn2/q2p4/P2Q4/1PP1P3/3N2PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Signalling the not very subtle plan of bringing all possible firepower to bear on c3.
23,1,14,1Rxf6,b'r5k1/p4ppp/2r1pR2/q2p4/P2Q4/1PP1P3/3N2PP/2R3K1 b - -',....and then comes this bolt from the blue. Initially I regarded it as a mistake - surely white didn't have enough pieces on the kingside to exploit it?
24,1,15,Rac8,b'2r3k1/p4p1p/2r1pQ2/q2p4/P7/1PP1P3/3N2PP/2R3K1 w - -',Back to business as normal ignoring the impending check.
25,1,16,2Ne4,b'2r2k2/p4p1p/2r1p3/q2p2Q1/P3N3/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',This was the point. Here I realized I had a problem in fact I thought i might be already lost. I spent a long time analyzing the defensive plan seen in the next few moves.
26,1,17,2Qd8,b'2rq1k2/p4p1p/2r1p3/3p2Q1/P3N3/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',Obviously white does not want to exchange queens. I figured Nf6 was likely and would be met by ...e5.
27,1,18,e5,b'2rq1k2/p4p1p/2r2N2/3pp1Q1/P7/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',As planned.
28,1,19,2Nxh7+,b'2rq1k2/p4p1N/2r5/3pp1Q1/P7/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',White now has a passed h-pawn but a potentially isolated knight for my rooks to chase.
29,1,20,2Qf4,b'2rqk3/p4p1N/4r3/3p4/P4Q2/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',White seems to run out of attacking possibilities after Qh8  Ke2.
30,1,21,2Qb6,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/1q2r3/3p4/P4Q2/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',Breaking out of defence with an attack on e3. 
31,1,22,2Qd4,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/1q2r3/3p4/P2Q4/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',White is now a pawn to the good after his sacrifice and perhaps fancies his chances in the endgame; though I could not see any other good move for him in any case.
32,1,23,2Qxd4,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/4r3/3p4/P2q4/1PP1P3/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',Finally allowing white to straighten his pawns in return for play against his problem knight.
33,1,24,Rg6,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/6r1/3p4/P2P4/1PP5/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',This move cuts off Ng5 and h4 will be met by f6 or Rh6.
34,1,25,2c4,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/6r1/3p4/P1PP4/1P6/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',Urgent counterplay.
35,1,26,3bxc4,b'2r1k3/p4p1N/6r1/8/P1PP4/8/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',White creates a mobile passed pawn front to compensate for the impending loss of the knight. 
36,1,27,Kd7,b'2r5/p2k1p1N/6r1/8/P1PP4/8/6PP/4R1K1 w - -',White wants his rook on the f-file; he cannot put it there and keep my king off the e-file at the same time.
37,1,28,Ke7,b'2r5/p3k2N/5pr1/8/P1PP3P/8/6P1/5RK1 w - -',cf. earlier comments
38,1,29,3Nxf6,b'1R6/p1r1k1r1/5N2/8/P1PP3P/8/6P1/6K1 b - -',Nf8 Rg8 Nd7!? saves the knight for the time being but after ...Rxb8 Nxb8 it is confined passively in the other corner. White prefers an ending with four passed pawns against rook.
39,1,30,Rg4,b'1R6/p1r5/5k2/2P5/P2P2rP/8/6P1/6K1 w - -',I urgently have to pick off a few of white's extra pawns before the c and d-pawns become too dangerous. The d pawn is immobilized for the moment by the need to protect c5.
40,1,31,Rxh4,b'3R4/p1r5/5k2/2P5/P2P3r/8/6P1/6K1 w - -',One down...
41,1,32,Rhh7,b'3R4/p1r4r/5k2/2P5/P2P4/6P1/8/6K1 w - -',Intending to cut off the white rook though it was too late for that.
42,1,33,Rh5,b'8/p1r1k3/R7/2P4r/P2P4/6P1/8/6K1 w - -',Heading for d5.
43,1,34,Kf6,b'8/p1r5/5k2/2Pr4/P2P2R1/6P1/8/6K1 w - -',Aiming to lure the rook to f4 and then exchange it if the king moves to the f-file. 
44,1,35,Rf5,b'8/p1r5/8/2P2rk1/P2P1R2/6P1/5K2/8 w - -',As planned though I can hardly say this sequence was forced.
45,1,36,Kf5,b'8/p1r5/8/2P2k2/P2P1P2/4K3/8/8 w - -',I just about have time to pick up the f-pawn before racing back with the king.
46,1,37,4Kd3,b'8/p1r5/8/2P2k2/P2P1P2/3K4/8/8 b - -',Otherwise I move the king over to d5 and white's pawn armada is over.
47,1,38,Ke4,b'8/p1r5/8/2P5/P1KPk3/8/8/8 w - -',The closing phase has to be played carefully. This move keeps the white king from d5 and virtually forces the pawn advance d5.
48,1,39,Rd7,b'8/p2r4/3P4/2P1k3/P1K5/8/8/8 w - -',Now if c6 Rxd6 wins both pawns. 51...Rc6?? of course would have been met by 52.d7!
49,1,40,5Kb5,b'8/p2r4/3P4/1KP1k3/P7/8/8/8 b - -',White heads for a6 where he can build a stalemate cage by advancing the a-pawn.
50,1,41,5a5,b'8/p2r4/3P4/PKPk4/8/8/8/8 b - -',Now if ...Rb7 ? Ka6 Kc6 (Kxc5 loses the rook) d7!  and black can only stop the pawn queening by leaving white in stalemate.
51,1,42,5Rh7,b'8/p6r/3P4/PKPk4/8/8/8/8 w - -',Removing the rook from the danger zone  and white resigns. Now if Ka6 Kc6 d7 black takes with the king e.g. ....Kxd7 Kxa7 Kc6  Ka6 Rh5! (not Rh8?) and black wins.
52,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This move controls the center and opens up lines for development of the queen and bishop. This move usually leads to sharp open battles but can also lead to quiet closed positions if White plays something passive like d3 Nd2 transposing into some kind of King's Indian Attack
53,2,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't like to play normal openings because White usually has a slight advantage in those openings and I have to fight for equality as Black. I like this move because White usually plays d4 here and the passive e6 is safe and solid and it usually brings White out of his opening repertoire.
54,2,2,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The sharpest moves were d4 and Nf3. This move is somewhat passive to play as White and can transpose into King's Indian Attack which is a passive opening and gives Black immediate equality.
55,2,3,Ne5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/4n3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I like to bring my queenside knight to the kingside so I can have an extra defender when I castle and also have an extra attacker if White castle's kingside. A lot of times when I play this opening White advances his pawns trying to chase my knight and a lot of pawn moves create weaknesses.
56,2,4,Ne2,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/4n3/4P3/6P1/PPPPNP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a terrible move and White should've expanded d4 with tempo or at least followed up with his plan to fianchetto the bishop. This move blocks the queen's path to the weakness f3 so now f3 is severely weak.
57,2,5,Nf3#,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/5nP1/PPPPNP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Just one simple mistake like that can lose immediately. Always keep track of your weaknesses and the defenders you have on that weakness otherwise something like this could happen to you.
58,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I have just started playing e4 and I am experimenting.  I am playing white here.
59,3,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play the pirc/modern/KID from time to time.  The problem with g6 is that in corr. chess white just has to many options.
60,3,2,c4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I wanted to take this into KID lines c4 gives it more of a d4 type feeling.  I originally played d4 so this is good for me.
61,3,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',Black is letting me develop however I wish so.... I will take the sameish setup.  I consider this the best threat against the KID.
62,3,4,e5,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pbp/1pnp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R w KQ e6',"Since black will not be getting through this center I will play on the kingside and attack.  I leave my kings position in doubt so that black doesn't no where to attack.  At any time I could castle queenside. 

When I was in Sacramento for the USCF Junior High Nationals I spent a lot of my time observing the top board: Alec Getz from Hunter.  I noticed that he played the caro-kann several times and didn't castle.  I learned that he found his rook on h8 to be better placed there then if he castled and it was on f8.  Because ofter he would later play h7-h5-h4."
63,3,5,Nh5,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2pbp/1pnp2p1/7n/2PNP2P/2NBBP2/PP1Q2P1/R3K2R w KQ -',"This is a blunder.  I ""failed"" to capitalize on it fully."
64,3,6,Bxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pbp2p1p/1pnp2p1/7n/2PbP1PP/2NBBP2/PP1Q4/R3K2R w KQ -',Here I should have played: Bxd4 Nxd4 Qf2! when the knights on d4 and h5 are both attacked winning me a pieces.  I didn't even look this far though!!  I saw that after Bxd4 Nxd4 he was threatening Nxf3  winning the queen and Nc2  forking the king and rook and stopped looking!!  This is a bad habit of mine that I am breaking it slowly. 
65,3,7,1Rdf1,b'r2q1rk1/1bp4p/1p1p2p1/p3n3/2P1P2P/2NBQP2/PP6/2K2R1R b - -',All the pieces are going to the king side.  Black won't even get a counterattack going.
66,3,8,2h5,b'r2q1rk1/1b5p/1ppp1np1/p6P/2P1PP2/2NB2Q1/PP6/2K2R1R b - -',I still have the iniative.  While black is reacting to my threats I am developing towards his king!
67,3,9,hxg6,b'r3qrk1/1b6/1ppp1np1/p7/2P1PP2/2NB2Q1/PP6/2K2R1R w - -',If 21...Qxg6 I was planning on Qh4 when the threats of Qxh2 e5 and Rg1 were good for me.
68,3,10,2Bxg6,b'r3qrk1/1b1n4/1pp3B1/p3P3/2P5/2N3Q1/PP6/2K2R1R b - -',Now I have this completely won.  Black's king has no cover and all my pieces are coming in on him!
69,3,11,Qxe5,b'r5k1/1b1n4/1pp3B1/p3q3/2P5/2N3Q1/PP6/2K2R2 w - -',Now the tactics finish him off.  I might have been able to get in Bh7  Kxh7 Rf7  but I didn't quite like it.  So I took the less risky route.
70,3,12,2Rxd7+,b'r7/1b1R4/1ppk4/p3q2B/2P5/2N3Q1/PP6/2K5 b - -',Winning the queen.  30...Kd3 31.Bg5  Kf6 32.Rf7  wins the queen.
71,4,0,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Qh4  is another way to decline the Gambit.Black gives up a tempo to confuse the position for white althought a correct play from white gives him an exellent game.
72,4,1,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4PP2/6P1/PPPP3P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Qe7 was much accurate.Now white gets a good lead in development with no conflics.
73,4,2,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP3P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Now white is simply and quietly begins to develop his pieces
74,4,3,Bg2,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4q3/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP2BP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',g3 has gave an opportunity not to but the bishop on c4 attacking f7 but Bg2! taking the good diagonal and playing more positionatly.
75,4,4,Bc5,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1q3/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP2BP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Blacks prevents white from castling and preparing to castle by his own.
76,4,5,d3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/4qn2/2b5/4P3/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',From this moment the position is much better for white to and the continuation is just improving that.
77,4,6,Ng4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/4q3/2b5/4P1n1/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I would consider this move as a big blunder. 0-0 was an option.

79,4,8,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/4q3/8/1b1PP1n1/2N2NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',white is finished his development and controls the center and is all good.
80,4,9,1b6,b'rnb1k2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2q3/8/1b1PP1n1/2N2NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',too slow. and why not to castle?

Already I'm looking at getting the queen to e1 or f2 after something like Qh6 Nh5 Qd2.  Either that or something that involves that plus g3 and Qg2.  My thinking is a little fuzzy but there must be something in there.  I hope to god there's something in there.

This perhaps isn't quite that high quality but Tom and I both know we're playing a heckuva game."
135,7,30,2Qe1+,b'r5r1/pp2b2p/8/2p4n/6bk/2NR1q2/PPP4P/R1B1Q1K1 b - -',The obvious move but I have no idea what my follow up is after Kh3.

This is why I'm 1500 USCF and 1750 gameknot.  I can just walk away and let the position work itself out on gameknot.  OTB I have to sit there and stew in my own adrenaline.
138,7,33,2Bh4,b'r5r1/pp5p/8/2p4n/4N1bb/3R1q1k/PPP4P/R1B1Q1K1 w - -',I'd been expecting a rook to f or light-squared bishop to somewhere or other.

141,8,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This continuation (Scotch) usally leads to an open game. Other moves like Bb5 or Bc4 can lead to closed positions that are more positional.
142,8,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here White was hoping for Bb4  c3 dxc3 O-O cxb2 Bxb2 where White has some compensation for his material deficit. Baker usually does well playing gambit openings but Black did not play into the gambit.
143,8,3,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White doesn't take the pawn immediately and instead wants to finish development. Black could play Nxe4 leading to Re1 d5 Bxd5 Qxd5 Nc3 where White regains the material with a slight lead in development. Most people play Bc5 here which holds the pawn and White's compensation usually isn't worth a pawn.
144,8,4,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black doesn't want to hold the pawn and get an advantage. This continuation leads to a form of the Scotch that is probably equal.
145,8,5,Nxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2Np1n2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I'm not sure if this was the best move even though it disrupts Black's pawn structure (leaving him with 3 pawn islands against 2) but Black also gets a stronger center.
146,8,6,Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',White doesn't want Black to take over with d5 so now Black can't because of d5 exd5 cxd5 Nxd5 Nxd5 Bxd5 Qxd5 Qxe7 and White has won a pawn
147,8,7,Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/2pp4/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black has been playing the opening pretty defensively so it's time for White to start an attack. bakerbaker has a lot of brilliant attacks in his annotated games
148,8,8,Nb6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1npp4/8/2B1PP2/2N5/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The c4-bishop isn't very important since it has low mobility so White just ignores the threat.
149,8,9,Nxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/8/2n1PP2/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black uses 4 knight moves to capture a bishop that has only moved once so now White has a big lead in development and superior control of the center.
150,8,10,1Rad1,b'r2q1rk1/pbp1bppp/2pp4/8/2Q1PP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White has completed development because he hasn't wasted any moves. Black's development is defensive and his bishop pair isn't doing him any good because the bishops have limited mobility. All of White's pieces are very mobile
151,8,11,1Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/pbp1bppp/2pp4/8/2Q1PP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black has a sneaky threat of Ba6

Black is hitting the e-pawn with 2 attacker and it is only defended by 1 piece which is being attacked. Black can do serious damage with these threats so this was where White began his do or die attack. Black is starting to regain activity and White wants to capitalize on his advantage now.
156,8,16,1e5,b'r1q1r1k1/pbp2ppp/3p1b2/2p1P3/5P2/2N1B2R/PPP1Q1PP/3R2K1 b - -',This is the best way to give up the pawn because Black has no more threats after that and White has more time to set up an attack

160,8,20,2Rf1,b'r1q3k1/pbp1rpp1/5b1p/2p1pP1Q/8/2N1B2R/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',White could've regained his pawn with Bxc5 but Rf1 threatens to sac on h6 with Bxh6 gxh6 Qxh6 Bg7 Qh7  Kf8 f6 forking the rook and bishop.

162,8,22,2Qg4,b'r4qk1/pbp1rpp1/5b1p/2p1pP2/6Q1/2N1B2R/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',If Bxc5 then the position becomes unclear where Black's bishop pair advantage interferes with White's material advantage. Instead White threatens the h-pawn to continue with the attack.
163,8,23,2Ree8,b'r3rqk1/pbp2pp1/5b1p/2p1pP2/6Q1/2N1B2R/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Black is too concerned about losing the exchange and maybe should've played Kh7 to stop White's attack. White will still probably be winning after taking the exchange but White won faster with the kingside attack.
164,8,24,2Rxh6,b'r3rqk1/pbp2pp1/5b1R/2p1pP2/6Q1/2N1B3/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',Threatening Rxf6 and if the bishop moves then f6 could be dangerous because now the f1-rook has the f5 square

167,8,27,2Ref8,b'r4rk1/pbpR1pp1/1q3b1R/2p1pP2/6Q1/2N1B3/PPP3PP/6K1 w - -',Black defends against the immediate threat but White's attack is still pressuring and Black will run out of defensive resources.

171,8,31,2Bg7,b'r4rk1/pbpR1pb1/1q4P1/2p1p3/6Q1/2N1B2R/PPP3PP/6K1 w - -',Here it seems like Black has defended against everything. Black is down a pawn and has a lot of weak pawns so White is winning. Black is hitting the g-pawn and h8 is well defended so White has no mating opportunities on the h-file. It seems like White would have to go into a complicated position with only a small advantage and win later on but he found this brilliant way to finish the attack and win the game quickly.
172,8,32,2Rh8+,b'r4rkR/pbpR1pb1/1q4P1/2p1p3/6Q1/2N1B3/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',Sometimes is just requires some out of the box thinking to complete mating attacks. It doesn't matter how much material is sacrificed as long as the attack leads to mate in the end. Black cannot take with the king because of Qh5  and White will play Qh7#.
173,8,33,2gxf7+,b'r4rkb/pbpR1P2/1q6/2p1p3/6Q1/2N1B3/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',Double checks are very strong because against any double checks only the king can move.
174,8,34,2Qg8+,b'r4rQb/pbpR1P1k/1q6/2p1p3/8/2N1B3/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',This stunning move forces the rook to take the queen so now the pawn's promotion square is clear.
175,8,35,3f8=N#,b'r4Nrb/pbpR3k/1q6/2p1p3/8/2N1B3/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',Like I said before double checks are very powerful. If White had promoted to a queen then it wouldn't be double-check so Black could simply block and White is lost since he sacrificed too much material. Black played too passively in the opening so White got a quick attack and finished it brilliantly. Remember to consider all options when you have a potential mating attack even if there doesn't seem to be a forced mate. Also check out bakerbaker's other brilliant attacks by going to his profile. Baker is the master.

As a 1. d4 player I am quite accustomed to reaching most of the standard QGA and QGD positions and like to develop with a protective move such as this early because I am more than willing to play Qa4  should the need arise to regain the gambit c pawn after 2...d5 3. c4 dxc and having the Nf3 squelches black ideas of play on my d pawn.
179,9,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',My opponent opts for a King's Indian set up. I can bet with some degree of certainty that his next 3 moves will be Bb7 0-0 and d6.
180,9,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Natural. White lays a claim on d5 while clearing c3 for the Nb1.
181,9,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',For black the dark squared bishop is one of the most powerful elements of the KID and it's natural home is on the long diagonal.
182,9,6,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As black is giving me all the time in the world to load up in the center I do so. The main danger for white is that black is preparing a very potent counterpunch once the opening phase ends as the KID is a very versatile defense (Fischer used it a LOT).
183,9,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Black secures his king rapidly and prepares to develop his queenside.

186,9,10,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Standard play by white as well. Both sides now have excellent chances of reaching the middlegame fully developed castled and with fighting chances. 
187,9,11,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',?! Black takes the first step off of the page by making this move. 6...e5 is the classical continuation. I suppose he was anticipating a big blast through the center and wanted to support it. 
188,9,12,O-O,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Sticking with the classical plan.
189,9,13,a6,b'rnbqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',? This move totally lost me. I have no idea what my opponent was trying to accomplish here. I was sure he would have played e5 here. I consider this move a tempo loser.
190,9,14,h3,b'rnbqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I felt that since I had the free tempo I would restrict my opponent's light squared bishop thereby keeping my Nf3 free to explore. 
191,9,15,Bd7,b'rn1qr1k1/1ppbppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black again declines playing e5. I'm beginning to wonder if he is some sort of KID genius and I'm severely overestimating my position. I realize that at this point that if I can push d5 should he ever play e5 I will have severley crippled his developing chances.
192,9,16,Be3,b'rn1qr1k1/1ppbppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Last piece developed.

194,9,18,1d5,b'rn1qr1k1/1ppb1pbp/p2p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Taking c6 away from black's Nb8 freeing up a lane for my Be3 and weakening my opponent's strong Bg7. A very multi-purpose move.
195,9,19,1Nh5,b'rn1qr1k1/1ppb1pbp/p2p2p1/3Pp2n/2P1P3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I guess black was hoping to launch f5 or perhaps play Nf4.

My best guess was that he feared g4 and wanted to create an escape square for his Nh5. One of the main strengths of black's position in the KID is his strong castled position and my opponent is voluntarily weakening it for me.
198,9,22,1Ng5,b'rn1qr1kb/1ppb1p1p/p2p2p1/3Pp1Nn/2P1P3/2N1B2P/PP1QBPP1/R4RK1 b - -',As white's pieces are coordinating for an assault on the enemy king I play Ng5 with malicious intent. I am now seeking sacrifice opportunities to further strip my opponent's defenses. I feel that it is fairly safe to entertain these ideas as black is underdeveloped and his pieces are not nearly as coordinated as mine.
199,9,23,1Ng7,b'rn1qr1kb/1ppb1pnp/p2p2p1/3Pp1N1/2P1P3/2N1B2P/PP1QBPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now I am convinced that black intends to play f5 to free up his position. So.......

Bxg which hits his queen and drives her to c8 where she cannot get over to defend her monarch. This move also threatens to open up the f file unopposed with the bonus of further stripping black's position.
203,9,27,1gxf5,b'rn1qr1kb/1ppb2np/p2p1p2/3PppN1/2P1P3/2N1B2P/PP1QB1P1/R4RK1 w - -',Black obviously sees the danger of taking out my knight and gets what he can. The main problem with that idea is that he is helping me accomplish my goal of depleting his defensive presence around his king.

While my results at the 38th Southern Congress weren't spectacular (2.5/5 with one win 1 draw two losses and a full point bye) I was very pleased with my play in this game. The idea of 14. f5 leaving a piece en prise for so long was the sort of tactic that so rarely comes my way. My opponent was very gracious in defeat and we discussed the game afterwards. It was agreed that his lack of proper development after such a strong opening was the determining factor in this game. Notice that his Ra8 Nb8 and queen never left their original squares.

230,10,11,1cxd6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1b1ppp/2nP1n2/1p1pp3/8/1N2PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I liked this exchange cause the pawn on d3 is now stranded and it is just a matter of time when it will fall. Meanwhile I opened my a-file for the Rook. This doesn't seem that relevant now but it will become very relevant later. From this point on I am actually looking to take advantage of this a-file opening.
231,10,12,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/2nP1n2/1p1pp3/6b1/1N2PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Attacking the pawn on d3 and pinning the Knight.

233,10,14,1gxh3,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/2nP1n2/1p1pp3/8/1N2PN1P/PP1B1P2/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I am starting to like this sacrifice more and more. It has brought me a lot of success in the past. Similarly I have struggled to defend against this sacrifice as well. So now I look much more aggressively to prevent the Bishop sacrifice by my opponents. Either way it is a both strong and an exciting move and most of times dramatically changes the course of the match. It sure did this time.
234,10,15,1Qxd6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/2nq1n2/1p1pp3/8/1N2PN1P/PP1B1P2/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So basically I have just cleared his pawn defense on his King with minimal material disadvantage. In addition my Queen is getting ready to get into the action and his King looks pretty blocked off by the pieces on his f-file.
235,10,16,1Qe2,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/2nq1n2/1p1pp3/8/1N2PN1P/PP1BQP2/R4RK1 b - -',With this move I got impression that he still was not concerned that much by his lack of defense in front of his King. He is actually attacking. I thought that might have not been the best move cause I was willing to sacrifice bunch of pawns to position my strong pieces in front of his King. I am sure not concerned with his attack of b5.
236,10,17,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2n2/1p1pp3/8/1N2PN1P/PP1BQP2/R4RK1 w - -',The menacing attack on h3. That had to grab his attention.

238,10,19,1Ra4,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2n2/1p1pp3/r7/1N2PN1P/PP1BQPK1/R4R2 w - -',I am ready to get that Rook in the action. Perfect opportunity to start bringing heavy artillery in front of his King. However it's still not perfectly clear where this rook will fit due to his 3rd row pieces. I still don't care that my b5 pawn is there for taking. I am actually using it as a bait.  
239,10,20,1Qxb5,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2n2/1Q1pp3/r7/1N2PN1P/PP1B1PK1/R4R2 b - -',He goes for it. Actually I think here he is trying to generate some kind of attack on that side. And this attack has some legitimacy. However my King is very well protected his King is very vulnerable and I am mounting an attack. 
240,10,21,1Rg4+,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2n2/1Q1pp3/6r1/1N2PN1P/PP1B1PK1/R4R2 w - -',This is the move that was at the same time obvious as well as surprising. If he takes the rook the game is practically over because I am then bringing Queen right in front of him and with his King being blocked of with f-file pieces he is trapped and soon would be done. So he opts correctly not to take it.
241,10,22,1Kh2,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2n2/1Q1pp3/6r1/1N2PN1P/PP1B1P1K/R4R2 b - -',My rook is under attack. I considered sacrificing the rook again but noticed at least 2 well thought-out sequence of moves that would get him out of the jam with a significant material advantage. Seeing his ranking has skyrocketed by this time into 1800s I realized he will find these moves so I decided to retreat the rook but keep the g-file offense.
242,10,23,2Nc5,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n2nr1/1QNpp3/8/4PN1P/PP1B1P1K/R4R2 b - -',I thought this was another attacking move where a defensive move might have been more appropriate. For some reason he still doesn't seem to see the danger of his situation.
243,10,24,2Ng4+,b'5rk1/1p1q1ppp/2n3r1/1QNpp3/6n1/4PN1P/PP1B1P1K/R4R2 w - -',I am using the fact that g3 take would bring the Queen into action to bring in more and more active pieces in front of his King. He still can't take the knight! 
244,10,25,2Qe2,b'5rk1/1p3ppp/2n3r1/2Nppq2/6n1/4PN1P/PP1BQP2/R4R1K b - -',Finally he abandons the attacks and brings his Queen back to defend. It was long overdue.. Few moves back I noticed that his advancing f2 pawn would bring a huge amount of relief to my attack so I kept one eye on that. Whatever I was doing I wanted to make sure that he doesn't get to move his f2 pawn.
245,10,26,2Qh5,b'5rk1/1p3ppp/2n3r1/2Npp2q/6n1/4PN1P/PP1BQP2/R4R1K w - -',I was starting to consider a possibility of a win at this point.... h3 is under great deal of pressure.
246,10,27,2Ng1,b'5rk1/1p3ppp/2n3r1/2Npp2q/6n1/4P2P/PP1BQP2/R4RNK b - -',However this move deflated my enthusiasm because I realized how much relief it brought to him. Not only that but he gets the chance to forward his f2 pawn he defends his h3 pawn and also my Ng4 is pinned! He can't take Ng4 with his h3 pawn yet as it is masking the Queen attack but this might change later. I was starting to get discouraged.... But I am still not giving up.... 
247,10,28,2e4,b'5rk1/1p3ppp/2n3r1/2Np3q/4p1n1/4P2P/PP1BQP2/R4RNK w - -',I had no option. I wanted to bring in the other Knight into action as I realized what I have so far is still not enough. Plus it brings some kind of protection against his f2 pawn advance. I still thought that advance of that pawn would have been a strong move whether I moved my e-pawn or not however at least I opened a landing spot for my c-Knight. 
248,10,29,2Nxb7,b'5rk1/1N3ppp/2n3r1/3p3q/4p1n1/4P2P/PP1BQP2/R4RNK b - -',He still decides to take another worthless pawn. He must have been under impression that he would be able to defend my attack and come out of it with material advantage. Advancing f2 pawn IMO would have been much better move.
249,10,30,2Nce5,b'5rk1/1N3ppp/6r1/3pn2q/4p1n1/4P2P/PP1BQP2/R4RNK w - -',I am getting them all lined up and ready to strike. I really want to eliminate his g1 Knight! Also more pressure on f3 in case he is ready to move the f pawn.
250,10,31,2Bc3,b'5rk1/1N3ppp/6r1/3pn2q/4p1n1/2B1P2P/PP2QP2/R4RNK b - -',Still no f-pawn move?... Naturally I won't object but now I am really closing in.
251,10,32,2Nf3,b'5rk1/1N3ppp/6r1/3p3q/4p1n1/2B1Pn1P/PP2QP2/R4RNK w - -',He is in clear trouble now. His Knight is under attack and once the Knight is gone so is the protection of his h3 pawn. 
252,10,33,2Qxf3,b'5rk1/1N3ppp/6r1/3p3q/4p1n1/2B1PQ1P/PP3P2/R4RNK b - -',He is now forced to sacrifice! ...

257,10,38,2b4,b'5rk1/1N4pp/6r1/3p1p2/1P4nq/2B1Pp1P/P2R1P2/5RNK b - b3',He is probably thinking that his only chance is to try to Queen this pawn before I close in on him. Again I might have focused more on the defensive move and bring his b-Knight more close to the action. But then again maybe he had no choice. Either way it's desperation time for him so he might as well try it.
258,10,39,2f4,b'5rk1/1N4pp/6r1/3p4/1P3pnq/2B1Pp1P/P2R1P2/5RNK w - -',That Rf1 really is itchin to get into action.

261,10,42,Ne5,b'6k1/6pp/6r1/N3n3/1P1p1r1q/5p1P/PB1R1P2/5RNK w - -',With this move I opened g-rook attack on his strong g-Knight. I am ready to sacrifice my rook to take that Knight out if needed.

The game wonderfully exemplified the importance of calculated sacrifice for the sake of positional advantage. Once that King castles always look for the opportunity to attack the pawn wall. Taking some hits and sacrifices for the sake of reorganizing your strong pieces in front of the helpless King can be much more valuable then the material advantage gained by your opponent.
One more important thing is to make sure when attacking with the Q to have enough pieces accompanying the attack. I almost learned the hard way as Q got into action a bit too early and I had to import accompanying pieces later on in hope he won't be able to bring the defense back in time. Had he not took so much moves attacking he might have been able to defend my attack."

282,12,8,2Rdd1,b'1r2r1k1/pq3pb1/5np1/2pp4/2P2P2/1PN2QPp/PB5P/3RR2K b - -',White is more and more in a bad situation. The pawn center is destroyed and the black d pawn can break through.
283,12,9,2dxc4,b'1r2r1k1/pq3pb1/5np1/2p5/2p2P2/1PN2QPp/PB5P/3RR2K w - -',Black starts an exchange sequence winning a pawn by a discovered attack on the queen.

286,12,12,3Kd4,b'8/p7/N2k2p1/3n1p2/1p1K1P2/6Pp/P6P/8 b - -',The King appeared in the center. Can white force black to lose the b pawn?
287,12,13,4axb3,b'8/p7/N2k2p1/3n1p2/3K1P2/1P4Pp/7P/8 b - -',Yes! White has growing hopes but the black Knight can now take the h pawn at only three moves!
288,12,14,Nxh2,b'8/p7/3k2p1/5p2/3K1P2/1P1N2Pp/7n/8 w - -',Black is now turning the game and can force White to defend at the h file while the a pawn is marching supported by the black King.
289,12,15,4Kxh1,b'8/8/3k2p1/p4p2/5P2/1P4P1/4nN2/7K b - -',White has defended the h file successfully but for what a price. The black King and knight are bothcloser to the a file than White. A fierce fight begins. Black can check.
290,12,16,Nxb3,b'8/8/6N1/p2k1p2/5P2/1n6/7K/8 w - -',White has only one pawn left. Is there a chance to halt the black a file pawn?
291,12,17,Kxf4,b'8/8/2N5/p4p2/5k2/1n6/7K/8 w - -',Now black has two pawns more. The last phase of the fight begins.
292,12,18,7Kxc5,b'8/8/8/2K5/p7/8/8/5k2 b - -',By taking the knight the white king is one step too far away from the last black pawn and black wins.
293,13,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I'm playing White here. I like Nf3 because it's very safe and waits to see what Black wants to do. My knight should be good on f3 no matter how Black continues. This game was played with only 10 minutes per player so it is not perfect and there were many blunders by both sides. Black gave me a total win at one point but I almost allowed him to draw because I made a lot of hasty moves
294,13,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here Black is threatening the central boost e5 so I had to think about if I wanted to allow it and castle or if I should play d4 and stop it.
295,13,2,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I don't like the drawish position that arises from d4 so I let Black have the central boost since I'm already castled and it shouldn't be too dangerous.
296,13,3,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',My position looks somewhat passive but I am very solid so if Black overextends then he could be left with weaknesses.
297,13,4,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/4p3/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Not the best move. It's better to solidfy your center instead of extending it too early.
298,13,5,Ng5,b'r1bnkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/6N1/4p3/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Now Black's pawn is weak from overextension and I can pile attackers onto it
299,13,6,e3,b'r2nkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/5bN1/8/2N1p1P1/PPP1PPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black is threatening my c2 pawn so he hasn't lost a pawn. But I am already castled and will have a slight lead in development so I should be better here especially since Black spends a move recapturing his lost pawn.
300,13,7,1Nb5,b'r2nkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/1N6/8/4B1PN/PPb1PPBP/R4RK1 b kq -',I am attacking both a7 and c7
301,13,8,1Rac1,b'r2nk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1n1p/1N6/8/4B1PN/PPb1PPBP/2R2RK1 b kq -',I didn't want to take the a-pawn because I thought taking the c-pawn would be better. I wasn't comfortable taking the a-pawn because it would oddly place my piece and I'm more concerned with completeing development and launching an attack
302,13,9,Bc6,b'r2nk2r/ppR2pp1/2b2n1p/8/8/4B1PN/PP2PPBP/5RK1 w kq -',I didn't notice that my rook was trapped here and I was only looking that Black was attacking my powerful bishop so I made a blunder next move
303,13,10,1f3,b'r2nk2r/ppR2pp1/2b2n1p/8/8/4BPPN/PP2P1BP/5RK1 b kq -',This is terrible I shouldn't block the path of my bishop just because Black wants to trade it. Now Black can win my trapped rook which he couldn't have done if I hadn't blocked my bishop's path
304,13,11,1f4,b'r3k2r/p4pp1/2p1nn1p/8/5P2/4B1PN/PP2P1BP/5RK1 b kq -',Maybe the blunder wasn't that bad because I can reopen the path for my bishop. I have a pawn for the exchange and I have the bishop pair. A lot of times having the bishop pair and an extra pawn is enough to compensate for being down the exchange. The bishops are especially powerful in open positions like this. So maybe it wasn't a blunder and more like an accidental sacrifice
305,13,12,1Rc8,b'2r1k2r/p4pp1/2p1nn1p/8/5P2/4B1PN/PP2P1BP/5RK1 w k -',Defending with Nd8 is more passive and leaves the rook on the dangerous diagonal
306,13,13,2Bxa7,b'2r1kn1r/B4pp1/2p2n1p/5P2/8/6PN/PP2P1BP/5RK1 b k -',By point value material is even but I think I'm winning because my bishops are very strong attackers in this position plus I have a passed pawn now.
307,13,14,2Rc1,b'2r1k2r/B4ppn/2p2n1p/5P2/8/6PN/PP2P1BP/2R3K1 b k -',Black may have been able to save this pawn if he played N8d7 c5 earlier
308,13,15,2Bxc6,b'2r2rk1/B4ppn/2B2n1p/5P2/8/6PN/PP2P2P/2R3K1 b - -',If I take with the rook then my lack of a rook will make Black's rook stronger after he trades rooks and plays Rc8
309,13,16,2b4,b'2rr2k1/B4ppn/2B2n1p/5P2/1P6/6PN/P3P2P/2R3K1 b - b3',I have two passed pawns now and a 1-point material lead. I thought winning with my queenside pawns would be easy but I got too careless and let some pawns slip away
310,13,17,Ne8,b'2r1n1k1/B4ppn/2Br3p/1P3P2/8/6PN/P3P2P/2R3K1 w - -',Black wants to bring his knight over to try to stop my passed pawns.
311,13,18,2Bc5,b'2r1n1k1/5ppn/2Br3p/1PB2P2/8/6PN/P3P2P/2R3K1 b - -',Here I made a few fast hasty moves and gave Black more chances. I should've thought harder since winning this position should be easy. My opponent had two more minutes than I had so I was trying to catch up on time which caused me to make such terrible moves
312,13,19,Rxa4,b'2r1n1k1/5ppn/2B4p/1PB2P2/r3P3/6PN/7P/2R3K1 w - -',I should not have given Black one of my passed pawns but that's what I get for getting too cocky and making moves that were not thought out
313,13,20,Nc7,b'2r3k1/2n2ppn/2B4p/1PB2P2/r3PN2/6P1/7P/2R3K1 w - -',This is a blunder by Black because I have the tactic b6 double attacking the rook and knight and my pawn can promote faster than Black can regain his piece
314,13,21,2Nd5,b'2r3k1/2n2ppn/2B4p/1PBN1P2/r3P3/6P1/7P/2R3K1 b - -',I thought this was a good move because I'm threatening Ne7  fork so it forces a knight trade and allows the advance of my b-pawn to be easy with the assistance of my bishops. I had about 4 minutes left here so I wanted to move quickly but I was moving too fast I totally missed my chance to get a winning position. Black's next move is also horrible blunder and I didn't spend time to exploit it. Black gave me two winning positions in a row but when you're making split-second decisions it's easy to miss tactics.
315,13,22,2Rxe4,b'2r3k1/2n2ppn/2B4p/1PBN1P2/4r3/6P1/7P/2R3K1 w - -',I cannot believe Black would make a move like this. He probably expected I would play Ne7  fork which isn't really a good move since Black can trade down to an ending where I have only a slight advantage. If I had actually spent time looking at this position I would've played Nxc7 which is totally winning.
316,13,23,Nxb5,b'2r3k1/4Bppn/2B4p/1n3P2/8/6P1/7P/2R3K1 w - -',This is what Black wanted and now material is even. I shouldn't have been too confident and thinking that any move I made was winning. I made about six or seven moves in less than ten seconds and now I'm not winning anymore. Black is also threatening Nd4 getting my pinned bishop
317,13,24,3Rd1,b'2r3k1/4Bppn/2B4p/1n3P2/8/6P1/7P/3R2K1 b - -',I started to get scared here but luckily I have this move that saves my bishop. If Black takes my bishop then Rd8  Nf8 Rxf8 Kh7 Rxf7 and I'm up a pawn with an attack on the king. I have also broken the pin so Bxb5 is also a threat
318,13,25,3Rd8+,b'1r1R2k1/nB2Bppn/7p/5P2/8/6P1/7P/6K1 b - -',I wanted to trade as quickly as possible because I had less than three minutes here. The game had no time delay or time increments added after each move so losing on time was an issue here.
319,13,26,3Bb6,b'5k2/nB3ppn/1B5p/5P2/8/6P1/7P/6K1 b - -',I was moving fast so attacking the knight while getting my bishop active seemed logical. My only advantage here is that I have the bishop pair. Black's knights are not as powerful because they don't have the long range abilities that the bishops have on the open board. The knight's abilities to jump over pieces are also not important in this position. 
320,13,27,g6,b'6k1/5p1n/2B3pp/2B2P2/8/2n3P1/5K1P/8 w - -',This is a mistake because of Black's one simple pawn weakening move I win a pawn by force.
321,13,28,4Bd4,b'6k1/7n/2B3pp/8/3B4/2n3P1/5K1P/8 b - -',If Black plays Na2 then Bd5 wins the knight. If Black gives check with Nd1 then Ke1 attacks the immobile knight. The bishops are definitely stronger because the knights limited range allows them to get trapped easily.
322,13,29,4Nb1,b'6k1/7n/2B3pp/8/3B4/6P1/5K1P/1n6 w - -',This is the only move that doesn't lose the knight but allows me to get Black's weakened pawn
323,13,30,h5,b'6k1/8/2Bn4/7p/5nPP/2B5/5K2/8 w - -',Here my first instinct was to advance the pawn and I almost did but then I saw that simple Nf5 and Ng6 maneuvers would win my weak pawn going into a probably drawn position. It's better just to trade which should be winning.
324,13,31,5Kf3,b'6k1/8/2Bn4/7n/7P/2B2K2/8/8 b - -',I had less than two minutes here but it was enough to win the game especially since I had almost caught up on time
325,13,32,Nxh4,b'6k1/8/2B5/7n/6Kn/2B5/8/8 w - -',Instead of playing Nf5 I think Black has a better chance by keeping the knights and trying to defend. Both of us have slightly more than a minute here so it's very difficult to analyse with hardly any time to think. This variation gives me a position that is easier to play with little time so Black should've kept the knights back and have a better chance of drawing
326,13,33,5Bd5+,b'6k1/8/8/3B3n/6Kn/2B5/8/8 b - -',This check probably wasn't necessary but my mouse cursor was closer to the bishop and I didn't want to spend an extra 0.5 seconds moving it to my king which i did during Black's move.
327,13,34,Nf5,b'5k2/8/8/3B1n1K/8/2B5/8/8 w - -',This position is theoretically won but without time to think I might screw it up.
328,13,35,Ne7,b'5k2/4n3/8/3B2K1/8/2B5/8/8 w - -',The knight should stay close to the king since it will just get trapped if it ventures off in the range of my bishops.
329,13,36,5Ba5+,b'8/2k1n3/4B3/B3K3/8/8/8/8 b - -',Black's king can't get closer to the center with Kc6 because I play Bd8 and then Black's knight is forced away from the king. 
330,13,37,5Kd6,b'8/1k2n3/3KB3/B7/8/8/8/8 b - -',Winning this type of endgame just takes logical moves and the position is simple enough not to require long analysis. 
331,13,38,6Bc7,b'8/2B5/k1nK4/3B4/8/8/8/8 b - -',Taking the knight is an obvious draw
332,13,39,6Kd7,b'8/1kBK4/8/8/1nB5/8/8/8 b - -',I am slowly pushing Black's king to the corner while all he can do is make random maneuvers that won't save the game
333,13,40,6Ba5,b'8/k2K4/n7/B2B4/8/8/8/8 b - -',I make this waste move to see what Black does. Eventually I will put Black in zugswang where anything he does will lose his knight or get mated. 
334,13,41,6Nb8+,b'1n6/k2K4/8/B2B4/8/8/8/8 w - -',If Nc5  then Kc6 Na6 Bc4 Nb8  Kb5 and then Be6 will trap the knight and I'll always have a tactic to win it. The knight's only escape after Kb5 is Nd7 but Be6 will trap the knight or force it away from the king where it can be trapped. I didn't have time to analyse this deep during the game but my moves were logical and usually in endgames the logical looking moves are correct.
335,13,42,Na6+,b'8/k1K5/n7/B2B4/8/8/8/8 w - -',It's bad to threaten my bishop with Ka6 because the simple Bc3 retreat wins immediately since Ka7 is the only move that defends the knight then Bd4  wins the knight.
336,13,43,Nd7,b'8/k2n4/8/BK1B4/8/8/8/8 w - -',Na6 loses to Bb6 
337,13,44,6Be6,b'8/k2n4/4B3/BK6/8/8/8/8 b - -',The knight can longer go back to the king because of Nb8 Bc8 Ka8 Kb6 and Black's king is stalemated while his knight is in zugswang and must move to where I can capture it.
338,13,45,6Nf6,b'8/k7/4Bn2/BK6/8/8/8/8 w - -',So the knight must leave the guard of the king where I can set up mating threats
339,13,46,7Kc6,b'8/k7/2K1Bn2/B7/8/8/8/8 b - -',Black loses quickly if he plays Ka6 because I play Bb6 and have an unstoppable mate in 1 threat.
340,13,47,7Bb4,b'8/k7/2K1B3/8/1B2n3/8/8/8 b - -',I shouldn't worry about taking Black's isolated knight yet since it isn't in a position to interfere with my mating ideas.
341,13,48,7Nf6,b'8/k7/2K1Bn2/8/1B6/8/8/8 w - -',"I win faster if Black's king moves to the 8th rank because Kb6 seals him in to be mated quickly.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_knight%27s_gambit

""White offers a pawn to divert the Black e-pawn and build a stronger center with d2-d4. Theory has shown that in order for Black to maintain the one pawn advantage moves must be made that seriously weaken the position of the Black pieces. King's Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings as it was examined by the 17th century Italian chess player Giulio Polerio. It is in an older book by Luis Ramirez de Lucena The King's Gambit is rarely seen at the master level. Black can obtain a reasonable position by relinquishing the extra pawn at a later time and consolidating defensively."""

Although it does develop a piece the bishop is misplaced on d6 and will have to move again to free the d-pawn. Black is already seriously cramped.

The side with more space should only trade in order to gain some other type of advantage instead. The text move does three things. First it commits me to castling long and attacking his kingside with pawns. Second it takes squares away from the g6-knight. Third it prepares h4 as the pawn storm begins.

Therefore Whites next move blocking the c-pawn is a little inconsistant in my opinion.

Admittedly Blacks dark-squared bishop is pretty passive at the moment but this may not always be the case (particularly in a game with no blocked pawns).  It could also have turned out to be an important defensive piece for Black.

516,18,8,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/2np1q2/5p2/8/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',But Black prefers to get his king tucked away.  The pawn could have been taken without too much trouble (e.g. 10...Qxb2 11.Bc4 (keeping the black king in the centre is vital if the pawn sac is to be worth anything) 11...Qc3  12.Nd2 Ne5 13.Bb3 c6 follwed by 14...d5 and 15...0-0 and White has no compensation) but safety first cannot be criticised!

The knight is on a great square here controlling some important squares (d3 and f4) so White is forced to exchange.
519,18,11,dxe5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/5q2/4pp2/8/P1P1P3/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Black has a small advantage because he has more space and control of the centre.

There was nio need to be in such a hurry to exchange a well posted knight for a moribund bishop however desirable exchanges usually are when a piece ahead.

White ought still to win but Black is back. The central pawn-couple proves to be the front line of Black's counterplay for the next phase of the game.
602,21,30,d3+,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/1P6/5Nq1/1P2p3/P2p2P1/4KP1P/R1BQR3 w - -',I'd also give more than a passing glance at 26...Qxf5 at once.  The d-pawn is safe enough.  If 27.Qxd4?? Qf3 secures a draw after 28.Kf1 Qh1ch etc.  
603,21,31,2Be3,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/1P6/5q2/1P2p3/P2pB1P1/5P1P/R2QRK2 b - -',A good post for the bishop.  Black's pawn centre is imposing but White ought to be able to contain them whilst mobilising his Q-side majority.  But Black is not yet without resource...
604,21,32,2Red8,b'r2r2k1/1p3ppp/1P6/5q2/1P2p3/P2pB1P1/5P1P/R2QRK2 w - -',Another approach is 28...Qh3ch which leads to a dangerous looking attack after 29.Kg1 Re5 30.f3 Rh5 31.Ra2 Rxa3!.  But after the spectacular 32.Qb3!! Black's attack peters out 32...Rxa2 33.Qxa2 ...

White contains Black's attack in the same way as the text move but with the added feature of attacking Black's centre.  If 33...exf3?? simply 34.Qxa3 wins out of hand.
608,21,36,3Ra4,b'6k1/1p3ppp/1P6/7r/rP2pP2/3pB1Pq/3R3P/2Q1R1K1 w - -',Possibly hoping White has overlooked the protection on c8: 34.Qc8ch?? Qxc8.  But ...Ra8 at once saves time.

610,21,38,Qc8,b'r1q3k1/1p3ppp/1P6/7r/1P2pP2/3pB1P1/3R2RP/2Q3K1 w - -',There's nothing doing on the h-file any more so Black regroups.  But offering Q exchanges looks counterintuitive.  White still has a marked advantage that would have only been enhanced by 36.Qxc8ch Rxc8 37.Bc5!  Instead 35...Rc8 seems to be indicated.

614,21,42,Ra8,b'r5k1/1p1q1ppp/1P6/P7/4pP2/3pB1P1/6RP/2Q3K1 w - -',Since his mistake on the 25th move White has maintained his piece advantage well enough but he hasn't been able yet to build much on it except seemingly to repel successive attacks.  Things look safe enough but this is where one needs to be on the alert!
615,21,43,4Bd2,b'r5k1/1p1q1ppp/1P6/P7/4pP2/3p2P1/3B2RP/2Q3K1 b - -',(?!) Protects the a-pawn but shuts the rook off from the Q-side.  41.Ra2 seems preferable here.

Qc8 49.Qf3! exd2 50.Qxb7 Qd8! 51.a7 Rc1! 52.a8=Q Rxg1ch 53.Kxg1 d1=Qch 54.Kg2 Qe2ch 55.Kg1 Qe3ch 56.Kg2 (=).  The astonishing text move is no worse and is probably better!
622,21,50,4a6,b'6k1/1p3ppp/PP6/8/4pP2/4B1Pq/2p4P/6RK b - -',(!) A fine diversion.  Black has to break off his attack.
623,21,51,4Qd7,b'6k1/1p1q1ppp/PP6/8/4pP2/4B1P1/2p4P/6RK w - -',(!) Not bad: retaining attacking chances down the d-file.  An alternative was 48...Qg4 after which White might have to settle for the draw after all: 49.a7 (or axb7) ...Qf3ch 50.Rg2 Qd1ch 51.Bg1 h6 52.a8=Qch Kh7 53.Qxb7 c1=Q 54.Qxe4ch etc.

It stood to reason that 49.a7 would commit the queen to passive defence for a long time to come whereupon White ought to be able to round up the c-pawn: 49.a7 Qd8 50.Kg2 (Black can draw after 50.Rc1?

779,29,18,1Bxf3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P4/5B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The expected recapture although gxf3 followed by castling long did cross my mind as a possibility. I wonder if my opponent considered it?
780,29,19,1Qxd4,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3q4/5B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Hard to believe the pawn is just hanging but it is. I am glad to win a pawn as that is usually enough to ensure a draw and give me winning chances in an endgame. I am behind in development and my queen is exposed so there is some danger in taking the pawn but in the balance I thought it was safe enough.
781,29,20,1Bc3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3q4/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',And now both his bishops have made it to the long diagonals. But the upside for me is that I get to trade queens!
782,29,21,1Qxd1+,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/R2qK2R w KQkq -',After this it will be imperative to finish development or I could face a nasty attack.
783,29,22,1Rxd1,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b Kkq -',And of course he recaptures with a developing move. I really am walking a dangerously fine line here.
784,29,23,1Nd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/8/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R w Kkq -',Preparing to castle long I am ready to play ...e6 to protect the h3-c8 diagonal and open up a line for my dark bishop to develop. I still have to figure out how to protect the g-pawn when the dark bishop leaves the back rank but first things first.
785,29,24,1O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/8/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b kq -',Completing development white can either play Rfe1 to pressure both central files or double rooks on the d-file. Despite being a pawn down white has a reasonable game. I wonder if he considered the d-pawn a gambit?
786,29,25,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/8/2B2B2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',And I am trying to catch up my development as quickly as possible. If I can get caught up and force some trades my extra pawn may start to tip the balance in my direction.
787,29,26,1Ba5,b'2kr1b1r/pp1npppp/2p5/B7/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Solving a problem for me. Now the g-pawn isn't attacked and the dark bishop can develop without trouble.
788,29,27,1Nb6,b'2kr1b1r/pp2pppp/1np5/B7/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',This is a perfect situation for me. Trading a pair of rooks will get me closer to a pawn up endgame while avoiding the rook trade cedes me the d-file. If he trades the bishop for knight the recapture ...axb6 leaves my king a nice place on c7 to hide from white's light bishop. 
789,29,28,1Rxd8+,b'2kR1b1r/pp2pppp/1np5/B7/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/5RK1 b - -',I am happy to see the trade.
790,29,29,1Rd1+,b'3k1b1r/pp2pppp/1np5/B7/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',And white is quick to grab the open file with tempo against my king.
791,29,30,1Kc8,b'2k2b1r/pp2pppp/1np5/B7/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Avoiding the pin that going to c7 would create. I suppose there would be ways to keep the pinned knight out of trouble later but I think the easiest way is just to not get it pinned in the first place.
792,29,31,1Bg4+,b'2k2b1r/pp2pppp/1np5/B7/6B1/8/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',"White must have a plan and I assume this move fits into it somehow but my first reaction was to think of Fischer's quote ""Patzer sees check patzer gives check."""
793,29,32,1e6,b'2k2b1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/B7/6B1/8/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',As mentioned before this is the planned move to block that diagonal and release the dark bishop.
794,29,33,1b3,b'2k2b1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/B7/6B1/1P6/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Looks like white is preparing c4-c5 to attack the knight. Until I protect the d8 square the knight is actually pinned as the only defense against Rd8#.
795,29,34,1Be7,b'2k4r/pp2bppp/1np1p3/B7/6B1/1P6/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',But now that d8 is protected the knight is free to move and I have achieved a safe pawn up position.
796,29,35,1Bc3,b'2k4r/pp2bppp/1np1p3/8/6B1/1PB5/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Now that the pin is no longer a threat the bishop attacks the weakness on g7.
797,29,36,1Bf6,b'2k4r/pp3ppp/1np1pb2/8/6B1/1PB5/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',I am not thrilled to disrupt my pawn structure this way but I had no other way to protect the g7-pawn.
798,29,37,2Bxf6,b'2k4r/pp3ppp/1np1pB2/8/6B1/1P6/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand I am pleased to have more wood off the board as I am ahead in material. Also this trade takes away the advantage of the two bishops that my opponent enjoyed. On the downside the h-pawn becomes isolated and the f-pawns get doubled. This is not a good thing in an endgame. Chess is a game of trade-offs. Very rarely is a situation clearly good or bad. There are always points on each side of the equation and the trick is to capitalize on the positives and try to diminsh the effects of the negative.
799,29,38,2gxf6,b'2k4r/pp3p1p/1np1pp2/8/6B1/1P6/P1P2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',With that in mind I will try to get the rooks off and put all my pawns on dark squares. That will make my opponent's light squared bishop unable to attack my forces. Then I will use my knight to attack the dark squares that my opponent's bishop cannot defend.
800,29,39,2c4,b'2k4r/pp3p1p/1np1pp2/8/2P3B1/1P6/P4PPP/3R2K1 b - c3',Not sure what white's plan is but normally he would be trying to put his pawns on the opposite color from his bishop. That would allow his bishop maximum freedom of movement. By keeping his pawns on the light squares white is restricting the movement of his own bishop.
801,29,40,2Rd8,b'2kr4/pp3p1p/1np1pp2/8/2P3B1/1P6/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',I am looking to get the rooks off as that will give me control of the dark squares.

804,29,43,2Ke7,b'8/pp2kp1p/1np1pp2/7B/2P5/1P6/P4PPP/6K1 w - -',But I have just enough resources to keep everything protected.
805,29,44,2Bf3,b'8/pp2kp1p/1np1pp2/8/2P5/1P3B2/P4PPP/6K1 b - -',Not sure what this is for but the bishop wasn't doing anything on h5 anymore either.
806,29,45,2Nd7,b'8/pp1nkp1p/2p1pp2/8/2P5/1P3B2/P4PPP/6K1 w - -',Getting out of the way so I can put pawns on b6 and c5. This will take some time as the c-pawn will need protection before the b-pawn can go to b6.
807,29,46,2b4,b'8/pp1nkp1p/2p1pp2/8/1PP5/5B2/P4PPP/6K1 b - -',Is he going to create a pawn chain on dark squares with a3 b4 and c5? If so it will be hard to defend as my king is more centrally located than his. That is a big advantage in the endgame.
808,29,47,2Ne5,b'8/pp2kp1p/2p1pp2/4n3/1PP5/5B2/P4PPP/6K1 w - -',This is a many-faceted move. By attacking both the bishop and the c-pawn I practically force him to play Be2. But the real point of this move is to protect the c-pawn so the b-pawn can move.
809,29,48,2Be2,b'8/pp2kp1p/2p1pp2/4n3/1PP5/8/P3BPPP/6K1 b - -',Practically forced as c5 allows me to wreck white's pawn structure with Nxf3. But would I have really given up my knight for his bishop? No I wouldn't have. 26. c5 would have been met by ...b6.
810,29,49,2b6,b'8/p3kp1p/1pp1pp2/4n3/1PP5/8/P3BPPP/6K1 w - -',And now I get it in anyway.
811,29,50,2a4,b'8/p3kp1p/1pp1pp2/4n3/PPP5/8/4BPPP/6K1 b - a3',Gaining space but to what effect? As these pawns get further up the board they get harder for the white king to protect should the bishop get traded off or the pawns get on dark squares.
812,29,51,2f5,b'8/p3kp1p/1pp1p3/4np2/PPP5/8/4BPPP/6K1 w - -',This is necessary so the rear f-pawn can go to the dark square f6. The long term plan is to have kingside pawns on h6 f6 e5 and f4.

But as I said chess is a game of trade-offs and this move not only presents me with a difficulty (fixing my pawns on light squares) but with an opportunity as well (his f-pawn is fixed on a dark square). Which factor will be more important? It is up to the creativity of the players."
814,29,53,2Ng4,b'8/p3kp1p/1pp1p3/5p2/PPP2Pn1/8/4B1PP/6K1 w - -',Hoping to induce 29. Bxg4 fxg4 undoubling my pawns.

816,29,55,2Nf6,b'8/p3kp1p/1pp1pn2/5p2/PPP2P2/7P/4B1P1/6K1 w - -',The knight will not stay here long as this square is reserved for the f7-pawn. I will need to decide whether to put the knight on d7 or e4.

818,29,57,3Kd6,b'8/p4p1p/1ppkpn2/5p2/PPP2P2/5B1P/6P1/6K1 w - -',Protecting the pawn is not required as ...c5 will accomplish the goal of getting all the queenside pawns on dark squares but I wanted to keep as many pawns on the board as possible. More white pawns means more targets :)
819,29,58,3g4,b'8/p4p1p/1ppkpn2/5p2/PPP2PP1/5B1P/8/6K1 b - g3',And now white as he did earlier solves a problem for me by allowing me to undouble the f-pawns.
820,29,59,3hxg4,b'8/p4p1p/1ppkpn2/8/PPP2PP1/5B2/8/6K1 b - -',Avoiding leaving his pawns isolated.
821,29,60,3h6,b'8/p4p2/1ppkpn1p/8/PPP2PP1/5B2/8/6K1 w - -',And this pawn gets to his intended destination. As a side benefit this pawn prevents g5 as the exchange on that square would leave my e-pawn passed.
822,29,61,3f5,b'8/p4p2/1ppkpn1p/5P2/PPP3P1/5B2/8/6K1 b - -',I flirted with the idea of pushing past and creating a passer right now but decided that trading was better in the long run. With the trade the h-pawn becomes passed.
823,29,62,Nd7,b'8/p2n1p2/1ppk3p/5P2/PPP5/5B2/8/6K1 w - -',And with the e4 square no longer available it is pretty easy to see the knight has to go to d7. Now I am very close to achieving the goal of getting all my pawns on dark squares after which my king can start to hunt targets.
824,29,63,3Bh5,b'8/p2n1p2/1ppk3p/5P1B/PPP5/8/8/6K1 b - -',Blockading the passed h-pawn and attacking the undefended f-pawn but I was planning to move it next anyway.

826,29,65,3Kg2,b'8/p2n4/1ppk1p1p/5P1B/PPP5/8/6K1/8 b - -',And he finally brings his king toward the center but it is too little too late.
827,29,66,3c5,b'8/p2n4/1p1k1p1p/2p2P1B/PPP5/8/6K1/8 w - -',If he takes on c5 I will recapture with the knight to menace the a-pawn.
828,29,67,3b5,b'8/p2n4/1p1k1p1p/1Pp2P1B/P1P5/8/6K1/8 b - -',But he decides to push and lock the pawns up. That is fine with me too.
829,29,68,3Ke5,b'8/p2n4/1p3p1p/1Pp1kP1B/P1P5/8/6K1/8 w - -',And my king goes hunting undefended targets.
830,29,69,3Bg6,b'8/p2n4/1p3pBp/1Pp1kP2/P1P5/8/6K1/8 b - -',Losing the f-pawn is unacceptable for white.
831,29,70,3Kd4,b'8/p2n4/1p3pBp/1Pp2P2/P1Pk4/8/6K1/8 w - -',Another undefended target.
832,29,71,3Bf7,b'8/p2n1B2/1p3p1p/1Pp2P2/P1Pk4/8/6K1/8 b - -',White tries to hold the position together.
833,29,72,3Ne5,b'8/p4B2/1p3p1p/1Pp1nP2/P1Pk4/8/6K1/8 w - -',But this move decides the game as it wins white's c-pawn which creates a passed c-pawn for black.

841,29,80,4Kh5,b'8/p7/1p3p1p/1P1k1P1K/P1p5/8/8/8 b - -',Another trade-off: the h-pawn is expendable if it allows the c-pawn to promote.
842,29,81,4Kg6,b'8/p7/1p3pKp/1P1k1P2/P7/2p5/8/8 b - -',One last gasp but it is hopeless. Even if I allowed him to win both the h- and f-pawns I could simply trade my queen for his f-pawn and my king would still pick off his a- and b-pawns for the win.

Black chooses to play a Grunfeld like structure but he's played d5 first.  White has played the opening with several commitments.  By playing a Colle like structure he's blocked in his dark squared bishop.  White likes to bring the bishop out to f4 or g5 BEFORE playing e3 when Black declares early intentions to play an Indian with Nf6 and g6.
846,30,2,c3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Perhaps too passive.  It does strenthen the d4 pawn but why not go for e4 right away?

After exd4 cxd4 dxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 and Rxe4 white has an isolated pawn but he has plenty of open lines to use plus the two bishops.  After completing development with Bf4 and Rd1 white has good chances.  The same position will arise after dxe4.
851,30,7,Nxd5,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/2p3p1/3np3/3P4/2PB1Q1P/PP1N1PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',If after cxd5 white should probably continue with Nb3 defending his d pawn leading to a similar position as seen in the game.

With the isolated pawn endgames are almost always unfavourable for the side possessing one but black's control of the e-file with his queen gives him good chances.  White's pieces are controlling the penetration squares on the e-file but they are unfortunately passive.  Take a look at the f1 and d2 bishops!  White is practically wasting his bishop pair.
855,30,11,Nd5f6,b'6k1/pp1n2bp/2p2np1/5p2/3P4/1N3B1P/PP1B1PP1/6K1 w - -',Not the best.  Why not N7f6?  The two knights are working in harmony and are firmly blockading the d-pawn.

857,30,13,2fxe3,b'6k1/pp5p/6p1/2Pp1p2/8/1P2P2P/P5P1/6K1 b - -',Time to evaluate this endgame.  It's quite complex actually.  Both sides have isolated pawns.  The kings are preparing to advance to the center.  Black has a pawn majority on the kingside while white has one on the queenside.  The queenside majority gives white dangerous chances though.  The majority has a lust to quickly expand with b4 and a4 with moves like b5 and then c6 coming in probably creating a strong passed pawn.  This may not happen but it is a threat.  It at least keeps the black king somewhat tied down to this area to prevent a passed pawn from becoming a deadly threat.
858,30,14,3Ke2,b'8/pp5p/4k1p1/2Pp1p2/8/1P2P2P/P3K1P1/8 b - -',Kf3 looks better but it is not.  Kf3 leads to no better chances for white.  He can't advance further after Ke5.  Hence Ke2 getting a more active position on the queenside with Kd3.  This stops black from playing something like Ke5 with d4 and Kxd4 getting the king close on the queenside.  White is pinning his chances to the queenside so it is best to prevent black from getting to that side.  
859,30,15,f4,b'8/pp5p/6p1/2Ppk3/5p2/1P1KP2P/P5P1/8 w - -',A losing blunder.  This takes the black king far too far away from the queenside.
860,30,16,3Kd4,b'8/pp5p/6p1/2Pp4/3K1k2/1P5P/P5P1/8 b - -',Now the black king can't get to the queenside.  His idea of Kg3 Kxg2 Kxh3 and then advancing his g-pawn is far too slow.  White simply plays b4 along with b5 and c6 forcing a passed pawn.  If black's g-pawn was more advanced things might have been different.

Besides that black must be VERY CAREFUL because the weakness on the dark squares specially the a1-h8 diagonal combined with the weakness of the 8 line can generate mating possibilities for white.

929,34,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White blocks d5 and has good control over the light squares.
930,34,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Although White already has three pieces developed my central structure is quite solid so White's development lead isn't as important as it would be if the center was open
931,34,6,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Nf6 I think is sharper. I don't think this is very necessary. I wanted to play b5 next move but then decided not to. You should always have a plan and don't keep changing your plans every move. My position is somewhat passive and underdeveloped so overextending with b5 may not be a good idea
932,34,7,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',White wants to open the position to capitalize on his lead in development
933,34,8,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Now this has transposed into some kind of Sozin Attack. If I play Nf6 here then it will transpose into the main line of Sozin. I'm not familiar with the main line so I tried some different moves.
934,34,9,Nd7,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1nbppp/p2pp3/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Some may question my passively played opening. I don't think there's anything wrong with playing passive if your position is solid but you need to be prepared for razor-sharp moves like White's next
935,34,10,Bxe6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1nbppp/p2pB3/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White sacrifices a piece to severely weaken my position so that it isn't solid anymore.
936,34,11,1Nxg7+,b'r1b1k1nr/1p1nb1Np/p2p4/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Here I think Bd2 is better than Nxg7  because my queen is misplaced and the knights will be strong on e6 and d5 attacking my c7 weakness. After the knight gives check the knight can no longer post itself on e6 so it isn't a strong attacker anymore
937,34,12,1Kf7,b'r1b3nr/1p1nbkNp/p2p4/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I wasn't comfortable with Kf8 or Kd8 since White has another check with Ne6 
938,34,13,1Nf5,b'r1b3nr/1p1nbk1p/p2p4/q4N2/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Now White has three pawns for the piece which gives a major imbalance to the position. It's hard to tell who is better here but I would prefer my position since a piece in the opening is usually better than three pawns. The three pawns are usually only better than the piece in endgames.
939,34,14,1Ngf6,b'r1b4r/1p1nbk1p/p2p1n2/q4N2/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',This blocks a dangerous Qh5 check. 
940,34,15,1Nxd6+,b'r1b4r/1p1nbk1p/p2N1n2/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I was relieved when White took the pawn because it's usually good for the defending side to trade passive pieces for the attacker's active pieces.
941,34,16,Nxe4,b'r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p2Q4/q7/4nP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Here I was happy with my position since my king is pretty much safe and I have a slight lead in development.
942,34,17,1Qd5+,b'r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p7/q2Q4/4nP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Since pawns are worth more in the endgame White wants to trade queens to increase the power of his 6 to 3 majority of overall pawns.
943,34,18,b5,b'r1b4r/3n1k1p/p7/1p1N4/4nP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ b6',My bishop should be strong on the long diagonal since White can no longer block it with f3.
944,34,19,1O-O,b'r1b4r/3n1k1p/p7/1p1N4/4nP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',It's usually better to have your king in the center during the endgame but it's uncertain whether this can be considered an endgame. There are still many pieces on the board so this is just a middlegame without queens.
945,34,20,h5,b'r6r/1b1n1k2/p7/1p5p/4nP2/4N3/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - h6',I didn't know what to do in this kind of position but I think this was dubious. I wanted to play h4 h3 and start an attack on the light squares but that plan may take too long to carry out.
946,34,21,1c3,b'r6r/1b3k2/p4n2/1p5p/4nP2/2P1N3/PP4PP/R1BR2K1 b - -',This is passive. White needs to develop his pieces quickly especially since I have an extra knight. White's undeveloped bishop and rook became a problem for him in the later endgame. Bd2 I think is much better than c3 which does nothing to help White's position.
947,34,22,1Rad8,b'3r3r/1b3k2/p4n2/1p5p/4nP2/2P1N3/PP4PP/R1BR2K1 w - -',Bd2 is impossible now and White's position is cramped
948,34,23,Rxd8,b'3r4/1b3k2/p4n2/1p5p/4nP2/2P1N3/PP4PP/R1B3K1 w - -',My position is clearly more active and better positioned but maybe it isn't enough to win since White has a lot of pawns and I didn't see any way to capitalize on my advantages
949,34,24,2a4,b'3r4/1b3k2/p4n2/1p5p/P3nP2/2P1N3/1P4PP/R1B3K1 b - a3',White attempts to get his rook into play while forcing a pawn trade. Here I thought this game was drawn since three pawns is considered equal to a piece and my pawns had no hope of promoting.
950,34,25,2h4,b'3r4/1b3k2/p4n2/1p6/P3nP1p/2P1N3/1P4PP/R1B3K1 w - -',My only hope to win this is to try for a mating attack on the kingside since White lacks defenders there. 
951,34,26,2c4,b'8/Rb1r1k2/5n2/1p6/2P1nP1p/4N3/1P4PP/2B3K1 b - -',"At first I thought White blundered because of bxc4 Nxc4 Rd1#
Maybe White didn't see my mate when he played this move or maybe he had something else in mind like bxc4 Ra4 c3 bxc3 Nxc3 which gives me a pawn but also leaves me with only one pawn on the board so White has good drawing chances in the endgame."
952,34,27,2b4,b'8/Rb1r1k2/5n2/8/1pP1nP1p/4N3/1P4PP/2B3K1 w - -',I decided to ignore the pawn so I wouldn't complicate the position. Maybe winning the pawn was better because now White has a passed pawn and potential winning chances. I think b4 gives me the most winning chances since taking frees up some space for White's pieces. Taking the pawn is more drawish while advancing the pawn gives super sharp dynamic winning chances for both sides
953,34,28,Nc5,b'8/1b1r1k2/5n2/2n5/RpP2P1p/4N3/1P4PP/2B3K1 w - -',Now White can't take the pawn or play Ra5 because of Nd3 winning a piece. But even then the position is too ultra complicated to know if that would be enough to win. 
954,34,29,2Ra2,b'8/1b1r1k2/5n2/2n5/1pP2P1p/4N3/RP4PP/2B3K1 b - -',The only other moves were Ra7 and Ra1. I think Ra1 is better since it defends the back rank if the bishop could move. But once again the position is too complicated to calculate accurate moves.
955,34,30,Nf4,b'8/1b1r1k2/8/2n2P2/1pP2n1p/4N3/RP4PP/2B3K1 w - -',This threatens Ne2 fork
956,34,31,2Kf1,b'8/1b1r1k2/8/2n2P2/1pP2n1p/4N3/RP4PP/2B2K2 b - -',Here I considered Nxg2 Nxg2 Rd1  which wins a pawn back but I wasn't concerned about the pawns now. I need to try for a mating attack so I should keep as many pieces on the board as possible to capitalize on my extra piece. Trading will benefit White who has more pawns.
957,34,32,Nxb2,b'8/1b1r1k2/8/5P2/2P2n1p/Rp2N3/1n1B2PP/5K2 w - -',I forgot that White could play g3 in this position instead of taking the pawn. g3 would probably give White better chances to draw or maybe even win but I stopped considering it after White took the pawn.
958,34,33,3Rxb3,b'8/1b1r1k2/8/5P2/2P2n1p/1R2N3/1n1B2PP/5K2 b - -',I think this is a mistake because now my rook becomes active on the seventh rank for a potential mating attack with my rook and two knights.
959,34,34,Kf6,b'8/1R6/5k2/5P2/2P2n1p/4N3/1n1r2PP/5K2 w - -',Here I thought I had good winning chances since I have a nice attack against White's weak king. I wasn't as worried about g3 as I was a few moves ago since I might not need any pawns to finish the game. Perhaps my pressure with my rook and two knights is enough to win if I can use my king to attack but this is too complicated to evaluate. This might be drawn but I still thought I had good winning chances since White must play perfectly. I want to be optimistic that I can win this but I would probably bet money that this is a draw.
960,34,35,3c5,b'8/1R6/5k2/2P2P2/5n1p/4N3/1n1r2PP/5K2 b - -',I think g3 was the best move to try to draw since it forces my last pawn off the board. The promotion idea is too slow because my mating attack idea is faster. This might be White's losing move but he might still have drawing chances after this.
961,34,36,3Nbd3,b'8/1R6/5k2/2P2P2/5n1p/3nN3/3r2PP/5K2 w - -',Now I have a forced mating threat like if White plays something careless like c6?? then I have Rf2  Kg1 Ne2  Kh1 Rf1  Nxf1 Nf2# which is a nice mate if White overlooks it.
962,34,37,3Rb1,b'8/8/5k2/2P2P2/5n1p/3nN3/3r2PP/1R3K2 b - -',This interferes with my forced mate threat and g3 is another idea. After g3 I have Rf2  Kg1 Ne2  Kh1 h3 (threatening Rf1  followed by Nf2#) so White plays Rb1 to stop Rf1  but I have Rxf5 threatening Nf2# and White is in trouble.
963,34,38,Rxf5,b'8/8/5k2/2P2r2/7p/3nN3/4n1PP/1R5K w - -',I use this opportunity to exploit my mate threat of Nf2# so now my rook is untouchable. I will win White's other pawn but still since I only have 1 pawn left I was lucky to hold onto White may still have drawing chances. I still have hope of winning this because White's king cannot get out from it's corner.
964,34,39,3h3,b'8/8/8/2P2rk1/6Np/3n3P/4n1P1/1R5K b - -',White is defended from mating threats so I didn't see any way I could possibly win now. I considered offering a draw but I was determined to win this endgame and get 2nd place in the tournament. If I drew this game then I would fall into a 4-way tie for 2nd.
965,34,40,3Rxc5,b'8/8/8/2r3k1/6Np/3n3P/4n1P1/1R5K w - -',"White should have a forced draw somewhere because it doesn't seem possible for me to win this. Kh2 avoids trading rooks and then my only chances of winning are if I can get my knights to g3 and f4 and then forcibly play Rxg2#
White letting me trade rooks gives me better winning chances"
966,34,41,Ndxc1,b'8/8/8/6k1/6Np/7P/4n1P1/2n4K w - -',I didn't want to take with the other knight because I wasn't comfortable with White playing g3.
967,34,42,4Ne5,b'8/8/8/4N1k1/7p/7P/4n1P1/2n4K b - -',Now this appears to be drawn since I see no way of promoting my last pawn. I didn't think I could ever win this since White will play Nf3 next move and take my last pawn but then I realized that two knights might be enough to mate White since he still has pawns on the board.
968,34,43,4Nxh4,b'8/8/8/8/7N/6kP/4n1P1/2n4K b - -',White offered a draw here and I was actually relieved that he took the pawn. If he leaves the knight on the board then he has a much better chance of drawing. Taking the pawn is probably losing although White must've thought that I couldn't possibly mate him with two knights.
969,34,44,4Kxh4,b'8/8/8/8/7k/7P/4n1P1/2n4K w - -',I declined the draw because White's king is cornered and his pawns are far from promotion. The only reason two knights can't mate a king is because the knights have to stalemate the king before mating it which would be a draw. Since White still has pawns on the board White won't be stalemated when I try to mate him with the knights so I still have winning chances and probably a forced win.
970,34,45,4Kh2,b'8/8/8/8/7k/7P/4n1PK/2n5 b - -',g3 and g4 lose quickly because Kg3 stalemates the king and then I just need to maneuver Nd3-f2 mate while White can only push his pawn. If both of White's pawns were off the board then this would definitely be a draw.
971,34,46,4Ng3,b'8/8/8/8/7k/6nP/6PK/2n5 w - -',I have to limit White's activity as much as possible
972,34,47,Nd3,b'8/8/8/8/7k/3n2nP/6P1/6K1 w - -',White's king is locked in the corner. It's like a puzzle to figure out how I can complete a mating maneuver with two knights.
973,34,48,Nf2,b'8/8/8/8/7k/6nP/5nPK/8 w - -',"I wanted to get my knight to e4 to support my g3 knight because if my king was on f2 then Nf1  Kh1 Ng3# would be mate.
When your opponent has limited moving range then It's okay to think as if you have unlimited moves "
974,34,49,Kg5,b'8/8/8/6k1/4n3/6nP/6PK/8 w - -',"My mating idea of getting my king to f2 will only work if White's h-pawn was blockaded so I was thinking that maybe I couldn't win this.
But if White tries to free space by pushing his h-pawn now then I should still be able to win since White can only maneuver his king back and forth from h2 to g1. White has better drawing chances if he keeps the pawns on the board and waits to see what I do instead of trying to get his pawns off the board quickly so he can claim a draw. I should be able to win as long as White still has 1 pawn on the board."
975,34,50,Kf4,b'8/8/8/8/4nk2/6nP/6P1/6K1 w - -',I'm hoping White will push the pawn since winning will be simpler if White only has one pawn. All I would need to do it find a cornering tactic and stalemate the king then complete a mating maneuver while White can only push his pawn. I analysed this ending with my opponent and a few other tournament spectators and couldn't find any way White could draw this. But White probably had many drawing chances before he sacced his knight for my last pawn.
976,34,51,Ke3,b'8/8/8/8/4n3/4k1nP/6PK/8 w - -',"I was happy I saw a cornering tactic if White pushes the pawn. If White doesn't push the pawn and keeps moving the king from g1 to h2 then 51.Kg1 Nf6 52.Kh2 Kf2 53.h4 Ne2 and there are many winning lines for me because White can't stop me from cornering the king with Ng1 and then completing the mating maneuver 54...Nf4 55...Ne2 56...Ng3#
But against 54.Kh1 after 53...Ne2 I don't need Ng1 and can just play Ng4 immediately followed by Ng3#.
Another winning sequence I analysed was Kg1 Nf6 h4 Ng4 h5 Ke2 h6 Ke1 h7 Ne2  Kh1 Kf1 h8=Q Ng3#"
977,34,52,5h4,b'8/8/8/8/4n2P/4k1n1/6PK/8 b - -',White decides to push the pawn and escape to h3 while my king isn't close enough to take the pawn.
978,34,53,5Nf1+,b'8/8/8/8/4n2P/4k3/6PK/5n2 w - -',This is my cornering tactic because White can't escape to h3 because of Nf2#
979,34,54,5Kg1,b'8/8/8/8/4n2P/4k3/6P1/5nK1 b - -',Kh1 loses quickly to Kf2 then Neg3# but my winning sequence after Kg1 was very nice and everything was pretty much forced after that
980,34,55,5Neg3,b'8/8/8/8/7P/4k1n1/6P1/5nK1 w - -',White's king is stalemated and can only push his pawn so I had everything calculated here to make sure I could forcibly checkmate White. Note that this position would be a draw if White didn't have the pawn on g2. 
981,34,56,Neg3#,b'7Q/8/8/8/8/6n1/5kP1/5n1K w - -',Just in time!
982,35,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This game is round 1 of the 2007 Wa Open held in Seattle.  Greg Serper Ignacio Perez Nick Raptis Georgi Orlov Viktor Pupols were some of the stronger players to grace our presence.

988,35,6,Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/1P2p3/2P5/3P1NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Black has a solid position but his pieces are a bit akwardly placed.  The White position is definately more harmonious and better developed.
989,35,7,1Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnnpbp/3p2p1/1P2p3/2P5/3P1NP1/PBQ1PPBP/RN3RK1 b - -',Ruling out any tricks based on ...e4 hitting the f3-knight and the b2-bishop.  This move also keeps the b1-knight flexible.  Sometimes Black will bring his knight to c5 and it is useful to be able to play Nbd2 and Nb3 to challenge.

This move also causes Black to move the d7 knight to c5 where I create a strucural weakness in Black's camp.  The e7 knight will be a weak attacking piece as it wont be as well coordinated with the Black queen as its parter on f6 would have been.
995,35,13,h6,b'1rbq1rk1/2p1n1b1/1p1p2pp/1Pn1p1N1/2P1Np2/3P2P1/1BQ1PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Probably not the best.  Black still had an interesting continuation with ...Nf5.

The White bishops are better than their opposites and the a-file rook is better than its opposite.  The White queen is better and the White king is safer.  Black has a space advantage on the kingside but his pieces are not well coordinated to assault the white king position.  While White is ready to infiltrate on the a file and pressure the queenside pawns.  And White has the better pawn structure.
997,35,15,1Bc3,b'1rbq1rk1/2p1n1b1/3p3p/1Pp1p1p1/2P1Np2/2BP2P1/2Q1PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',If there is one thing I have learned from going through master level annotated games it is to activate every piece and play as actively as possible.

I was expecting ...Bg4 when Bd5  followed by Ra1 would be good for me but Black would have a light-squared bishop for counter play.  Things would still be a little tough.

While it is true that Black's most natural plan is to play ...Ne8 or ...Nh5 followed by ...f5 and a kingside attack White ignores the fact that his most dynamic play will be on the queenside.  Here is trying to drum up kingside play and allows me time to target the weakened queenside.  White's king is more vulnerable on the queenside and my solid defensive formation on the kingside wont be easy to crack.  Especially with the two bishops and the knight placed passively.

1092,38,24,6Rh5,b'8/6KP/8/p1B4R/P1kP2P1/2p4r/8/8 b - -',Rh5! If RxR gxR and after c2 the B can stop the pawn queening by going to a3. 
1093,38,25,6c2,b'8/6KP/8/p1B4R/P1kP2P1/7r/2p5/8 w - -',c2! The only hope. It probably still loses.
1094,38,26,Qg5+,b'7Q/6K1/8/p1B3q1/P1kP2P1/7R/8/8 w - -',Check until you can check no more!
1095,38,27,7Ke3,b'8/5q2/8/p1B1Q3/P1kP2P1/4K2R/8/8 b - -',Black has no checks but...
1096,38,28,7Qg6,b'8/8/6q1/p1B1Q3/P1kP2P1/4K2R/8/8 w - -',neither does White! Black is threatening another spree starting at Qd3 
1097,38,29,Qc2+,b'8/8/8/p1B1Q3/P1kP2P1/7R/2qK4/8 w - -',Qc2 !! If the King takes it is stalemate.
1098,38,30,7Kxf2,b'8/8/8/p1B1Q3/P1kP2P1/7R/5K2/8 b - -',Stalemate!
1099,39,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',This opening is called the center counter defense or the scandinavian defense. The idea for black is to avoid White getting a strong center. The drawback for black is how to answear when/if White simple takes the pawn. If black for instance tries to recapture with the queen he will a lose a tempo if white replies with Nc6.
1100,39,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The most common answear for white. 
1101,39,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So Black avoids the problem with the exposed queen. However he is now down a pawn. At least for the time being. 
1102,39,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White choses to develop instead of trying to keep the pawn.
1103,39,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Black is now equal again however he loses a tempo now.
1104,39,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Following the general principle(GP): Knights out before Bishops.
1105,39,6,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black tries with a fianchetto. 
1106,39,7,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Always nice when you can develop with a pin.
1107,39,8,Be2,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/1n4p1/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"The GP: unpin ASAP!
As filippus kindly pointed out for me after 8...Bxf6 9. Bxf6 Black cant take the unprotected c-pawn with the Knight as White can play Qa4  or Bxb7 winning material...
Howevever as we shall see White overlooked this fact. "
1108,39,9,c6,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/1np3p1/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"I think castling or Nc6 would have been stronger and more natural. Black must keep up in ""the develop-race"".
But the pupose of this move is clear: W. can no longer respond with Qa4  or Bxb7(as the c6-pawn is blocking) after 8....Bxf6 9. Bxf6. So W is now forced to recapture with the g-pawn if he wants to keep his c-pawn..."

1110,39,11,Bxf3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/1np3p1/8/2PP4/2N1Bb2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black takes advantage of whites blunder. White now has to choose between a exposed king or a pawn down.

1126,39,27,Qxc7,b'r2r2k1/2q2pbp/1p2pnp1/p7/2PP1P2/P2BBPR1/2Q4P/6RK w - -',Whites pressure on g6 is very strong but a sac is too expensive.
