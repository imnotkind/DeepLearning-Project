2,0,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',He continues with the Main Line.
3,0,3,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',Preparing to bring my Ng1 to e2.
4,0,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ c6',He strikes at my centre.
5,0,5,Nge2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I continue with my plan.
6,0,6,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ d6',"He makes another central advance. This is similar to another recent game I played against the lovely penelope80 but in that game she played d5 earlier so I didn't have to worry about black doubling my c pawns with BxNc3 as I could always undouble the pawns by exchanging on d5 and so I was able to develop my Ng1 to the more active square of f3. For this reason I think the move order played by Mike Williams is better.

7,0,7,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/P1NBP3/1P2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',So I hit his bishop.
8,0,8,Bxc3+,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1bBP3/1P2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',He takes with check. I thought long and hard about which piece to recapture with here. Eventually I played......
9,0,9,Nxc3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This seemed better as to not have doubled pawns. In fact I found out later that taking back with the b pawn is more popular. I may well try that if I reach this position again.
10,0,10,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',He is now threatening exchanges ending up with him winning a pawn on d4. This seems to me to be a strong developing move but in fact in the opening databases I have black has played 8....cxd4 here.
11,0,11,dxc5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2Pp4/2P5/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',So I take.
12,0,12,dxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2P5/2p5/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',He exchanges.

14,0,14,1Qa5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/q1P5/2B5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I did now consider an exchange sacrifice. 11. b4 Nxb4 12. axb4 Qxa1 13. Qc2 and I am threatening to trap his queen with 0-0 and Bb2. Unfortunately he has 13.....Nd5! with advantage to black. So instead I played a more obvious move....
15,0,15,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/q1P5/2B5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This of course!
16,0,16,1Qxc5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2q5/2B5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',He takes back.
17,0,17,1Qe2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2q5/2B5/P1N1P3/1P2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I protect the bishop.
18,0,18,1Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/2B5/P1N1P3/1P2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',He attacks it again.
19,0,19,1Ba2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/8/P1N1P3/BP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Bishop drops back. Although white is now confined to the back three ranks white can now develop with tempo attacking the black queen and black's advanced knight can also be driven back with gain of time if necessary. I think white has a small edge.
20,0,20,1Rd8,b'r1br2k1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/8/P1N1P3/BP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',This looks good but doesn't lead to much.

22,0,22,1Bd7,b'r2r2k1/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/4P3/P1N5/BP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So he develops his bishop.
23,0,23,1Be3,b'r2r2k1/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/4P3/P1N1B3/BP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I attack the queen as per my plan.
24,0,24,1Qc7,b'r2r2k1/ppqb1ppp/4pn2/4n3/4P3/P1N1B3/BP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Queen drops back.
25,0,25,1Bf4,b'r2r2k1/ppqb1ppp/4pn2/4n3/4PB2/P1N5/BP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I pin the knight.
26,0,26,1Bc6,b'r2r2k1/ppq2ppp/2b1pn2/4n3/4PB2/P1N5/BP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Bishop moves to a more active square.
27,0,27,1Rac1,b'r2r2k1/ppq2ppp/2b1pn2/4n3/4PB2/P1N5/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',With a half-pin on the c file.
28,0,28,1Rac8,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b1pn2/4n3/4PB2/P1N5/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',He also completes his development. OK stop. Bearing in mind white wants to win this game what do you think is the best move for white?
29,0,29,1Nd5,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b1pn2/3Nn3/4PB2/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Did you consider this move? I don't think it leads to advantage for white but it causes black problems which thankfully my opponent did not meet in the best way. I also considered 18. Nb5 but realised it is easily met by Bxb5 19. Qxb5 Nf3+ 20. gxf3 Qxf4 with advantage to Black. Computer seems to prefer 18. b4.
30,0,30,1exd5,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b2n2/3pn3/4PB2/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',So he takes.
31,0,31,1exd5,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b2n2/3Pn3/5B2/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',I take back threatening the Ne5 and the Bc6.
32,0,32,1Nxd5,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b5/3nn3/5B2/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',He takes the pawn. OK I can take the Ne5 with Bishop or Queen. Which would you chose and why?
33,0,33,2Bxe5,b'2rr2k1/ppq2ppp/2b5/3nB3/8/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',"Of course! Qxe5 loses to Nxf4!
At the time and during the post match post mortem I liked Re8 here - I thought it drew for black after say Re8 21.	Bxc7	Rxe2 22. Bxd5 Bxd5 23. Be5 and black can't take the Be5 as his own back rank is weak and this seems a very drawish opposite coloured bishop ending. However computer prefers the move Black actually played and prefers White after 20.....Re8 21. Re1!"
34,0,34,2Qe7,b'2rr2k1/pp2qppp/2b5/3nB3/8/P7/BP2QPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',So as I said this may be the best move for Black. 
35,0,35,2Rfe1,b'2rr2k1/pp2qppp/2b5/3nB3/8/P7/BP2QPPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',I support my bishop preparing a queen move.
36,0,36,2Nb6,b'2rr2k1/pp2qppp/1nb5/4B3/8/P7/BP2QPPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',I think this is a terrible move decentralising his knight.
37,0,37,2Qg4,b'2rr2k1/pp2qppp/1nb5/4B3/6Q1/P7/BP3PPP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Threatening both the queen but also a discovered attack on the queen for instance if g6 then 23. Bb8 wins the a pawn. 
38,0,38,2Qf8,b'2rr1qk1/pp3ppp/1nb5/4B3/6Q1/P7/BP3PPP/2R1R1K1 w - -',So this is more or less forced.
39,0,39,2Bb1,b'2rr1qk1/pp3ppp/1nb5/4B3/6Q1/P7/1P3PPP/1BR1R1K1 b - -',With the threat of 24. Qf5 forcing g6 when 25. Qf6 mates.
40,0,40,2g6,b'2rr1qk1/pp3p1p/1nb3p1/4B3/6Q1/P7/1P3PPP/1BR1R1K1 w - -',Stopping that threat.
41,0,41,2h4,b'2rr1qk1/pp3p1p/1nb3p1/4B3/6QP/P7/1P3PP1/1BR1R1K1 b - h3',Played to weaken up the Black king side. For instance if I can play h4-h5 I am threatening to exchange on g6 and then play a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. If now 24.....h5 then 25. Qg5 and again I am threatening a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. I think his best defence now is Qh6 but thankfully for me that was not forthcoming. 
42,0,42,2Bd7,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b1p1p/1n4p1/4B3/6QP/P7/1P3PP1/1BR1R1K1 w - -',He attacked my queen. This is probably a losing mistake.
43,0,43,2Qg5,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b1p1p/1n4p1/4B1Q1/7P/P7/1P3PP1/1BR1R1K1 b - -',Now I am also threatening Qf6 and mates. Qf3 was also strong. Nd5 had to be played but white is much better.
44,0,44,2f5,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b3p/1n4p1/4BpQ1/7P/P7/1P3PP1/1BR1R1K1 w - f6',And this is a major error. What should white play now?
45,0,45,2Ba2+,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b3p/1n4p1/4BpQ1/7P/P7/BP3PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Did you find it?
46,0,46,2Nc4,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b3p/6p1/4BpQ1/2n4P/P7/BP3PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',What is best now?
47,0,47,2Rxc4,b'2rr1qk1/pp1b3p/6p1/4BpQ1/2R4P/P7/BP3PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Bxc4 also wins of course but this is quicker.
48,0,48,2Be6,b'2rr1qk1/pp5p/4b1p1/4BpQ1/2R4P/P7/BP3PP1/4R1K1 w - -',What else?
49,0,49,2Rxc8,b'2Rr1qk1/pp5p/4b1p1/4BpQ1/7P/P7/BP3PP1/4R1K1 b - -',And Black resigns. Many thanks for reading please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing with my annotations! Until next time dear reader!
50,1,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I didn't know what to do if after 1...e5 he played 2.f4.  But I would've started by accepting the gambit since that's what reversion in our third game.
51,1,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"Since however he played the Ruy Lopez I'll answer with what I'm most comfortable doing which is the Berlin Defense.  Afterall ""Stick with what you Know."" is effective but especially against this runner."
52,1,2,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Not to my surprise he castles.
53,1,3,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',And I take due what I've studied with cplusplus11 in a game against Jack Stockel.  Later on I studied the same thing in my first game with reversion.  It boils down to one thing which is that I'm staying in book for the same reason mentioned a move earlier. 
54,1,4,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Still in book.
55,1,5,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq d6',But this is where I deviate and try something different.  The most common move is to retreat back.  Generally speaking I'd answer with 5...Nf3  But this is the strongest opponent that I've been playing against.  So I'm not messing around.  Instead of retreating I decide to defend with my pawn and treat it as though it were the Philidor's Defense even though it's something different.  The idea in this context was preventing the loss of tempo since I don't want to be bothered going back to the original square that I started off.  Also if I moved back 6.Nxe5 becomes available right away.  So I thought that I was preventing Terence from getting my N back until the next move.
56,1,6,Nc5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1Bnpp3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Knowing that it was a question of where to retreat.  I wanted to play 6...Nf6 but thought that this square gave my N a better outpost.  Turns out that it doesn't but the main reason behind playing this however is that I enjoy having both my N's close together.  Plus they're towards the center and coordinating your pieces near that area gives you better center control as I learned (some time ago) from Susan Polgar.
57,1,7,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/1BnpN3/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',?? This however is the terrible blunder.  Unlike my game with albertwall I made a very similar blunder that happened with bhidragon and it's quite bad.  Yes I went back to the chess bits and wisdom as opposed to thinking about how the games developing.  My hyperfocus was on continuing with development and trying to control the center.  I knew that my Nc6 but forgot that it happened twice.  I was thinking along the lines that if he took I'd take back.  And it's that simple after what happened in our first where I got too nervous.  This time the opposite happened as now despite not being pompous I was most certainly overly confident.  However it also boils down to the same mistake that I made with reversion in our second game.  With the N being attacked two times Terence will get a pawn+piece without compensation.  Since my Nc6 is pinned better was 7...a6 to for a defender.  But I don't know how much that would help after the next move anyhow.  Better then what I mentioned (so best) was to break the pin with 7...Bd7 which is the most common way to break that pin.  And if he takes I would've had an answer to that.  It might have meant exchanging pieces and possibly losing a pawn but it's much better then what happens being that and piece without compensation this early.
58,1,8,1Nxe7,b'r1b1k2r/p1p1Nppp/3q4/2np4/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',At first I thought that it wasn't a free piece.  But due to his Re1 it is.  This is why it was better to stop this threat by breaking the pin at once.
59,1,9,1Be6,b'r3k2r/p1p1Nppp/3qb3/2np4/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Knowing what's unfolded and given that I can't castle short but also bearing in mind that the Queen is out my focus becomes castling long or opposite wings of elyhim.  I remembered two past games where my opponent castled on opposite sides with good results.  In those instances when I castled short the opponent would castle long and would end up with good results.  The difference in this case however is that I'm behind.  But since I'm following the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules I'll try that method of castling on opposite wings anyhow.
60,1,10,1Nf5,b'r3k2r/p1p2ppp/3qb3/2np1N2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',But he has a threat that must be answered first.  Due to my Be6 being pinned I can't take.
61,1,11,1Qf8,b'r3kq1r/p1p2ppp/4b3/2np1N2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',And knowing that I can't castle short as noted I just retreat here.  I also bear in mind that anything loses my Queen or g7 pawn so why not defend both?
62,1,12,1Nc3,b'r3kq1r/p1p2ppp/4b3/2np1N2/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Continuing his development.
63,1,13,1O-O-O,b'2kr1q1r/p1p2ppp/4b3/2np1N2/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',And as noted I castle on the opposite wing.  Another reason for doing this isn't just because it was used against me.  But there is a bigger story.  With the pin his Nf5 and Re1 Terence was threatening to win my Be6.  By castling however that threat is gone as now I can protect it.
64,1,14,1Nd4,b'2kr1q1r/p1p2ppp/4b3/2np4/3N4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',With that being said his N was under attack and thus needed to defend it.
65,1,15,1Bd7,b'2kr1q1r/p1pb1ppp/8/2np4/3N4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',And I use that time to avoid further liquidation.  The bad part is that he is going to win another pawn.
66,1,16,Be8,b'2krbq1r/p1p2ppp/8/2nN4/3N4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Just like with Knights my plan was to get my Bishop to a better outpost.  The plan involves 15...f6 and then 16...Bf7 or 16...Bg5.  I think it would've been g5 since I like bringing them to good spots and I am thinking of strategy similar to what Susan Polgar emphasized with the Knights which you saw in one of her games and an OTB WTW Game against Bernie.
67,1,17,1Ne7+,b'2krbq1r/p1p1Nppp/8/2n5/3N4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',But he stops that with this move.
68,1,18,1Kb7,b'3rbq1r/pkp1Nppp/8/2n5/3N4/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I also could've answered with 15...Kd7 but it would've just been for the thrills and giggles of a one move attack.  It's pointless due to his Re1 protecting Ne7.  In addition this would restrict the mobility of my Rd8 and as we know mobility is vital.
69,1,19,1Qf3+,b'3rbq1r/pkp1Nppp/8/2n5/3N4/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Not surprised to see Terence play this.
70,1,20,1Ka6,b'3rbq1r/p1p1Nppp/k7/2n5/3N4/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',And this is how I was going to answer anyway.
71,1,21,1Ndc6,b'3rbq1r/p1p1Nppp/k1N5/2n5/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Attacking my Rd8 which I overlooked.  
72,1,22,1f6,b'3rbq1r/p1p1N1pp/k1N2p2/2n5/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',?? This is where I thought it was safe to follow up on that plan overlooking my Rd8 being under attack.  In doing that he gets a Rook.  Although I don't enjoy liquidating here the only move that would've stopped this was 17...Bxc6.  The other move that it appears to work (17...Ra8) fails due to his discovered with 18.Nb4+  Afterwhich he still gets the Rook.
73,1,23,Bd7,b'3N1q1r/p1pbN1pp/k4p2/2n5/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',?? With Ne7+Nd8 I can't get my LSB to the square that I desired.  So I bring it here.  But I overlooked what's coming which is mate.
74,1,24,Nxb7,b'5q1r/pnpbN1pp/4Rp2/k7/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - -',I thought that I had temporarly gotten myself out of trouble.  I couldn't calculate everything but thought that if I got out with the monarch in anyway moved he'd mate.  By playing this it appeared that I was in better shape.  But it's coming one way or another with no to defend against it.
75,1,25,2Nc6+,b'5q1r/p1p3pp/2N1Rp2/kbQ5/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 b - -',And I resigned here because Terence will mate on his next move.  My only two options are 23...Ka6 after which he has 24.Qxa7# Or 23...Ka4 and then comes 24.b3#
76,2,0,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"Not surprised to see him play the Ruy Lopez.  I used to answer with 3...Be7 due to me being overly protective of my Nf6 when the reality is that it's a waste of time to even think that.  So I had to remind myself of something important that ubermensch43 told me which I later emphasized to my students being that a ""Fight or Flight"" syndrome is not supposed to occur in chess.  That used happen to me but later I followed some advise from reversion and annotated a game between tactical-abyss and brigadecommander on the Berlin Defense.  Not only does this inhibit that mechanism but now I feel more comfortable about my position because my K side is better placed.  The Bishop was allright on e7 but now I don't feel that my position as crammed.  As later I'll bring to a square which I like better since the plan involves K side development and castling short."
77,2,1,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile he castles.
78,2,2,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',And I complete my K side development this.  Although it's not an inaccuracy I forgot that there was a slight problem with this move as white can answer with 5.c3 followed by 6.d4  Not much tempo loss but the problem is that after exchanging pawns white would be left with a solid pawn structure as reversion emphasized in our training session.  This is something that I do not like and had overlooked.  Therefore I'm lucky that he doesn't follow up with c2-c3.
79,2,3,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Instead he takes.
80,2,4,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1n3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"Knowing that my Nc6 is not pinned I take back.  Yes ""To take is a mistake.""  Therefore I normally wouldn't have even considered this move but kept in mind what bhidragon told me since my focus was on castling and controlling the center.  But for me that's just chess bits and wisdom.  What he said however was not to focus on those chess quotes or bits and wisdoms but rather think about what the board is telling me.  In this case the board appeared to indicate that it's allright to take.  If I saw an immediate threat like mate or loss of material I wouldn't have played it.  The thing is that I don't see that in sight.  However that says little since there is something that I might be missing.  This is important to try and find out though."
81,2,5,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1n3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',I kept in mind this move since I know that nothing is free lest you paid the ultimate.  But in anticipation I thought that there might be something to do to limit the damage.  He will definitely take back a piece but my instincts are right as I get a pawn in return.  In doing so I do not wind up behind.  However there is something that I forgot about it.  It boiled down what he'd take.  I anticipate his next move but the issue was forgetting that it was 1.e4 deal.  That makes an open position and I took his N.  In the process where he gets my Bishop I've already lost the exchange because a B is worth more.  Therefore he gets the stronger piece and winds up with a slight initiative.
82,2,6,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/8/1BP1n3/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I delay castling to think more about what the board was telling me as noted.  I almost played a move that a more experienced player wouldn't have even come close to considering.  The move was 7...Nxc5?? which looks good but in reality is an outright blunder.  It's because I nearly overlooked 8.Re1.  Now that would've left my Ne5 pinned after which he gets a piece for pawn.  So I had to think about what else.  Therefore based on what reversion did to me in our second game after a mistep I decide to add an attacker here.  The idea being is that white's c5 is attacked twice by Ne4 and Qe7.  Consequently I felt that he better be careful or lose a pawn.
83,2,7,Nxc5,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/8/1Bn1n3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',"?? Figuring that he made a mistake with this move I felt that in the context of this position ""To take is a mistake"" did not apply here.  As a result I knabbed his pawn.  But what I kept in mind before playing this was that although the N remains pinned to the Queen that's the worst that can happen.  I could break this pin and protect though with ...Qd6.  So I planned ahead but miscalculated and this problem has gotten a lot worse.  I was thinking of a whole bunch of moves that he might play.  And that would come with variations based on how I'd respond (which is in fact the main way that I've surpassed a 1300 rating.)  But what I overlooked was the immediate danger.  I already know that it was bad.  Mr original instincts would be that I'm forced to give up a piece or  the Queen.  In reality no matter what I do he will get my Queen for Rook."
84,2,8,a6,b'r1b1k2r/1pppqppp/p7/1Bn1n3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Knowing that the Queen isn't pinned yet I thought I had an answer.  My chess thought process was that if he took on e5 I'd take back on b5 as it would be even.  It was wrong calculation since the inference was that he'd captured with his f4.  What I overlooked is where the Queen is since it's on the same file as his Rook.  So when he captures with my Rook my Qe7 will be pinned.  Therefore not only does he get a Queen for Rook but on top of it a piece for free.  With that being said I'd normally resign right after 11.fxe5 since as reversion puts there's technically nothing more to learn.  But because it's a WTW game I'm following the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules which prohibits resignation until there is a forced mating sequence.
85,2,9,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1ppp1ppp/p7/1Bn1P3/8/8/PPP3PP/RNBQ2K1 w - -',?? With nothing else to lose I go back to my bag of chess quotes and castle at once.  However this was not the time or place to do it for better was 11...axb5.  At least I would've gotten a piece back.  But by playing this his next move will result in liquidation since pieces will be exchanged.  And that's something that I do not like when far behind like this.
86,2,10,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/1ppp1ppp/8/1pB1P3/8/8/PPP3PP/RN1Q2K1 w - -',Knowing that there's nothing else to lose I go after his e5.
87,2,11,1Nc3,b'r1b1r1k1/1ppp1ppp/8/1pB1P3/8/2N5/PPP3PP/R2Q2K1 b - -',All I can say is that this completes his development.  But I think that better would've been 14.Bd4 as now I will take his e5.  However the capture in itself does not help my position.  As noted I stay in to sastify the Supplemental Talking the Talk rules in order to avoid being questioned by the mods at the WTWLTR club.

We needed at least a draw away to Wrexham 2 to become champions. They out-rated us on the top board but we out-rated them on the bottom three boards.
189,6,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So it starts conventionally enough.

201,6,13,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPP3BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',With is bishop on this square I now begin to think in terms of playing d6-d5 and threaten d5-d4 forking his Be3 and Nc3. However an immediate d6-d5 is met by Be3xc5 so I have to prepare with b7-b6. An immediate 9....b7-b6 leaves me weak on the long white diagonal for instance he can play 10. e4-e5 and if dxe4 he has 11. Nf3xe5 and my Nc6 is pinned along the diagonal. So I decide to move my rook off a8 first.
202,6,14,1Qd2,b'1rbqk2r/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPPQ2BP/R4RK1 b k -',With the idea of f4-f5 and Bh6 at some stage.

207,6,19,1exd5,b'1rbqk2r/4npbp/ppn3p1/2pp4/5P1N/2NPB1P1/PPPQ2BP/R4RK1 w k -',So I take back still with the threat of d5-d4.

209,6,21,1O-O,b'1rbq1rk1/4npbp/ppn3p1/2pp4/5P1N/2NPB1P1/PPPQ2BP/4RRK1 w - -',So I castle threatening d5-d4 again. He can play 14. f4-f5 here as my fork d5-d4 is met by his fork 15. f5-f6 so computer thinks best for both sides is g6xf5 Bh6. It is all very complicated but probably better than what he played which is a little passive.
210,6,22,1Bf2,b'1rbq1rk1/4npbp/ppn3p1/2pp4/5P1N/2NP2P1/PPPQ1BBP/4RRK1 b - -',Which was this. I rather liked my position now. f4-f5 has been prevented most of my minor pieces seem to be on better squares than his I just need to catch up with development.

Ra1 Bxf2+ 23. Qxf2 Bd5 and although white is getting the pawn back all the bishops are coming off. I may have a slight advantage in that his queen side pawns are very weak but it would have been pretty level. Instead he takes another route...

247,6,59,3Re6,b'6k1/5p1p/Rp2rbp1/2p5/1PPp1P2/3P2P1/5B1P/6K1 w - -',So I do this instead. 
248,6,60,3bxc5,b'6k1/5p1p/Rp2rbp1/2P5/2Pp1P2/3P2P1/5B1P/6K1 b - -',So he takes.

251,6,63,3fxe6,b'6k1/7p/4pbp1/2p5/2Pp1P2/3P2P1/5B1P/6K1 w - -',I take back. I should be able to draw this although white has slight advantages in the my queen side pawns are fixed on black squares and my e pawn is isolated. However at present it stops his king from reaching d5.
252,6,64,3g4,b'6k1/7p/4pbp1/2p5/2Pp1PP1/3P4/5B1P/6K1 b - -',This is a good move giving his bishop more room and gaining space on the king side.
253,6,65,3Be7,b'6k1/4b2p/4p1p1/2p5/2Pp1PP1/3P4/5B1P/6K1 w - -',I reposition my bishop to attack his pawn on f4.

262,6,74,4Bg3,b'8/8/3bpkpp/2p5/2PpKPP1/3P2BP/8/8 b - -',Leaving me rather short of moves. Nicely played by him!
263,6,75,4Bc7,b'8/2b5/4pkpp/2p5/2PpKPP1/3P2BP/8/8 w - -',So I retreat my bishop.
264,6,76,4Bh4+,b'8/2b5/4pkpp/2p5/2PpKPPB/3P3P/8/8 b - -',He throws in a check. Computer prefers 41. g5+
265,6,77,4g5,b'8/2b5/4pk1p/2p3p1/2PpKPPB/3P3P/8/8 w - -',Computer doesn't like this move and prefers Kf7.
266,6,78,4fxg5+,b'8/2b5/4pk1p/2p3P1/2PpK1PB/3P3P/8/8 b - -',He takes.
267,6,79,4hxg5,b'8/2b5/4pk2/2p3p1/2PpK1PB/3P3P/8/8 w - -',I take back.
268,6,80,4Be1,b'8/2b5/4pk2/2p3p1/2PpK1P1/3P3P/8/4B3 b - -',Now if only I could my bishop safely onto the h4-d8 diagonal and my king to a safe square his h pawn would be permanently backwards. However I have not the space nor the time.
269,6,81,4Bd6,b'8/8/3bpk2/2p3p1/2PpK1P1/3P3P/8/4B3 w - -',So Play this.
270,6,82,4h4,b'8/8/3bpk2/2p3p1/2PpK1PP/3P4/8/4B3 b - -',And he gets rid of his backward pawn.

Againwith proper opening book studythe Bird can be played with relative safetyeven though the stats are not good on the Bird.Much of those bad stats are based upon not studying the best opening moves and/or not using the better opening books like Hiarcs which is upgraded every 3 months.Its not freebut its worth it!""

372,10,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1Bpp4/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But instead of taking Ted decides to deliver a check.
373,10,7,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/1Bpp4/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Although I don't like cramping my position as noted in another annotation I'm basing this move on what archduke_piccolo has previously told me.  He said that in the Siclian when white plays Bb5+ the best move is ...Nd7.
374,10,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/1Bpp4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Meanwhile he continues with his development.

The reason I didn't play this was because cplusplus11 gave me advice not to do those one move attacks just because you can.  In this case I think it would've worked because white must struggle to save a piece.  Even if 6...a6 7.Be2 dxe4 8.Nxe4 black has 8...f5 and now white's Ne4 is attacked in many ways.  There are only two ways to save the N but both options result in further loss of tempo.

377,10,11,Ngf6,b'r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/1p2pn2/1BppN3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',With that being said I continue with my development.

379,10,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/p2nbppp/1p2pn2/1BppN1B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',So I answer this time by breaking the pawn with further development.
380,10,14,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/p2nbppp/1pN1pn2/1Bpp2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I'm not surprised to see Ted hitting my Queen which does one way or another force my next move.
381,10,15,1e5,b'r1b1k2r/p1qnbppp/1pN1pn2/1BppP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',And in doing so Ted takes advantage of that.  At first I thought that this won a piece.  Although it's very rare once in a while I forget important facts.  One of them being that my pin was broken.  So I defend.  Obviously I don't like the best move since it prevents me from castling.  But there's no choice as anything loses a piece.  And it's important to note that I directly kept in mind what bhidragon told me about seeing the overall picture.  That's because if I were hyperfocused on castling I'd move elsewhere and lose the N in return.  So I go by what the story that the board is revealing being black's Nf6 is attacked in many directions which only leaves one option to defend with which means not castling.
382,10,16,1Ng8,b'r1b1k1nr/p1qnbppp/1pN1p3/1BppP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',That's because Ted will exchange like crazy.  And the only way to prevent the loss of material is to take back with my monarch.  Afterwhich he will castle however.
383,10,17,Rd8,b'r1br4/p1qnkppp/1p2p3/1BppP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I'm trying to compensate by doing the equivalent of castling which is bring the Rook on the other side and then move the King back as taught by Jack Stockel.
384,10,18,1dxc5,b'r1br4/p1qnkppp/1p2p3/1BPpP3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Before I get the chance Ted takes which forces me to recapture in order to avoid the loss of a pawn.
385,10,19,1b4,b'r1br4/p1q1kppp/1p2p3/1BnpP3/1P6/2N5/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',Then he attacks my N.
386,10,20,1a6,b'r1br4/2q1kppp/pp2p3/1BnpP3/1P6/2N5/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I reattack.
387,10,21,1Be2,b'r1br4/2q1kppp/pp2p3/2npP3/1P6/2N5/P1P1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Not to my surprise Ted retreats probably realizing that this is an open position given that it involved the KPO which makes the Bishop worth more.  That's why when he went after my N I was going to go after his Bishop.  So after retreating I come up with a plan of exchanging material.  It's really early but I'm already starting to think about and calculate the endgame.  It's as though I was visualizing it because while not exact the end turns to have an important similarity to what I'm thinking here.  And that thought is based on a passed end game with the same opponent.
388,10,22,Rb8,b'1rbr4/4kppp/pP2p3/3p4/8/2q5/P1P1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I go after his pawn.
389,10,23,1Qd3,b'1rbr4/4kppp/pP2p3/3p4/8/2qQ4/P1P1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',And he wants to exchange Queens.  Well I accept because in doing so I get a pawn.  That's what's really going through my mind but believe it or not (way in the back of my mind) although the same technique isn't there I'm just starting to calculate the B+M mate idea.  The main reason however is the win of material.
390,10,24,2Rab1,b'2br4/4kppp/pr2p3/3p4/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',I'm not sure why but Ted wants to exchange Rooks.  I accept do to being ahead.  However this whole attitude came before TA's lesson on Queen exchanges.  Exchanging because you can should not be done although at the time I thought that it was generally a good idea to do so as it changes the dynamic's of the game as I once learned.  However he outlined that against players who are not as strong it becomes beneficial since stronger players have things in mind which applicable here.
391,10,25,f5,b'2br4/4k1pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/1R4K1 w - f6',Breaking through.  Although we're not there yet my plan is to get a passed pawn.  So  what needs to be done though is a pawn advances then the e pawn advances two squares.  Therefore it's an f5-e4 that follows up with ...d3 and you keep using that chain until pawns can be exchanged.  That's because exchanging like that often leaves you with a passed pawn since no pawns can be in front of or to the side of the opposing pawn.  That is the idea though.
392,10,26,2Rb8,b'1Rbr4/4k1pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 b - -',Ted thinks that he has pinned my Bishop.  But what he doesn't know is that if I move by Bishop and he takes I'd recapture since I'm not going to move my Rd8 for a while.
393,10,27,2Kd7,b'1Rbr4/3k2pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - -',But I have a better idea since we're starting to approach the endgame.  So I bring my monarch into action to defend the Bishop since we're at the phase where the K becomes a weapon.
394,10,28,2Ra8,b'R1br4/3k2pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 b - -',Going after my a6.
395,10,29,2Bb7,b'R2r4/1b1k2pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - -',?! So I counterattack.  However this is a perfect example of where the one move attacks don't work since he is going to pin my monarch afterwhich I wind up in trouble.
396,10,30,2Ra7,b'3r4/Rb1k2pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 b - -',Stopping the attack and as noted pinning my B.
397,10,31,2Kc7,b'3r4/Rbk3pp/p3p3/3p1p2/8/3B4/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - -',? So the plan is to break the pin since the idea was 26...Kb8.  But with this move he is going to get back a pawn.
398,10,32,Kb6,b'3r4/Rb4pp/Bk2p3/3p1p2/8/8/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - -',So I attack in a different way since this appears to win a piece.  This is a case where I was just starting to get overly confident.  As noted in reality they don't tell who's winning or losing.  Instead you must figure it out for yourself.  The problem was that in a game or two against Jack Stockel I assumed to be winning and thought that one move did it when in reality that's what lost.  The difference is that I know Ted but it doesn't make right especially here since he will win a pawn.  Now I calculated the capture but overlooked that I'm in check when he takes.  And now that we're near or even in the endgame this mistake should be costly.  In fact it could lose since all it takes an extra pawn at this point.
399,10,33,h5,b'3r4/6R1/k3p3/3p1p1p/8/8/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - h6',Given that I'm now a pawn ahead this is where I start thinking way ahead.  And that is by thinking about how the Bishop and Knight work together to deliver that mate and math is very much included as well.  I ask myself if it can be applied here and do Homework based on what had to be done to pass the course.  There are a couple of ways to do things.  This this requires a lot of thinking and what also comes to mind is what was needed to pass College Algebra with Trigonometry.  So I start by thinking about what needs to be done to put pressure on white's position.  It starts by advancing the pawn and the short term plan does work.  That's because (although it's generally not said) I tricked him into playing 29.h3  It's part of Psychology because I wanted to make him worry that the h5 would become overpowering so that when he stops it my monarch is brought right into action.  That's because one thing you need with the N and B is obviously the monarch.  And as noted before I'm applying the same concept.
400,10,34,3Rh7,b'3r4/7R/4p3/1k1p1p1p/7P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 b - -',Trying to win a pawn.
401,10,35,3Rc8,b'2r5/7R/4p3/1k1p1p1p/7P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - -',So I have a plan which is that if he takes I'll take back.  However he places me in check.
402,10,36,Kc4,b'2r5/1R6/4p3/3p1p1p/2k4P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - -',So now I feel more comfortable about my position believe it or not.  I'm not going for opposition since it can't be talked with his pawns obstructing the monarch.  Therefore my aim is to centralize the K.  Yes during any phase of the game but especially at a disadvantage you want to bring the King towards the center.   And another reason for playing is that it will give me a passed pawn since I'm coming up with ways to get his c2.  I'm not implying that it is a passer but it's going to happen sooner then later. 
403,10,37,3Re7,b'2r5/4R3/4p3/3p1p1p/2k4P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 b - -',Trying to get another pawn.
404,10,38,3Rc6,b'8/4R3/2r1p3/3p1p1p/2k4P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - -',So I protect this time.
405,10,39,3Rh7,b'8/7R/2r1p3/3p1p1p/2k4P/8/P1P2PP1/6K1 b - -',Ted still wants to grab a pawn.  With no way of defending I come up with another plan to avoid losing another pawn as then it would pretty much be lost.  So even though I'm thinking of the Bishop and Knight other factors needed to be considered here to like defending.  In other words I'm not ignoring the only ways to save the position either since it's also based on as noted the story that the board is revealing (the overall picture.)
406,10,40,3Kc3,b'8/7R/2r1p3/3p1p1p/7P/2k5/P1P2PP1/6K1 w - -',So the idea is like before that if he takes I'll recapture.  This time however it happens.  And in the process unlike before I will have a passed pawn.  In addition that will be where those concepts apply since the passer will work with the Rook to Queen.
407,10,41,3f4,b'8/8/2r1p3/3p1p1R/5P1P/8/P1k3P1/6K1 b - f3',Stopping my f5 pawn.  It's a good choice because I was eventually going to advance after moving the f pawn.  That's because you use that pawn chains for the passed pawns.  In other words that's where they work.
408,10,42,3Kb2,b'8/8/2r1p3/3p1p1R/5P1P/8/Pk4P1/6K1 w - -',Therefore I go after his passed pawn. 
409,10,43,3a4,b'8/8/2r1p3/3p1p1R/P4P1P/8/1k4P1/6K1 b - a3',Which he protects for now.
410,10,44,3d4,b'8/8/2r1p3/5p1R/P2p1P1P/8/1k4P1/6K1 w - -',So bearing in mind that I now have a passed
411,10,45,3Kf1,b'8/8/2r1p3/5p1R/P2p1P1P/8/1k4P1/5K2 b - -',Which he tries to stop.
412,10,46,3Ra6,b'8/8/r3p3/5p1R/P2p1P1P/8/1k4P1/5K2 w - -',But it's too little too late.
413,10,47,3Rh6,b'8/8/r3p2R/5p2/P2p1P1P/8/1k4P1/5K2 b - -',And after this move I will gladly exchange pawns with Ted since it appears that I've got it worked to the system.  
414,10,48,d3,b'8/8/4R3/5p2/r4P1P/3p4/1k4P1/5K2 w - -',"As the saying goes ""Passed pawns must be pushed."""
415,10,49,4Re1,b'8/8/8/5p2/r4P1P/3p4/1k4P1/4RK2 b - -',Trying to stop it.  If I didn't know how to handle this he would get a draw.  Why do I say that now?  It's because of the second most difficult Homework assignment I've done.  This is the one where I don't remember the exact position.  But ...Re1 was the solution.  It had to do with promoting the pawn and after which white would force the stalemate.  Sadly that GM missed it.  With that assignment however means that I know something and what Ted's thinking.  It's allow the promotion.  A variation like 40...e2 41.Ke2 dxe1=Q 42.Kxe1 after which he would likely get the stalemate which would be the same way that ...Re1 forces the draw.
416,10,50,4Rxf4+,b'8/8/8/5p2/5r1P/3p4/1k4P1/4RK2 w - -',But since I'm too familiar with that technique I prevent that from happening by capturing and placing him in check.  This way the monarch must move away from his Re1 and after he gets out I'll take another pawn.  That will leave him without counterplay.
417,10,51,4Rd1,b'8/8/8/5p2/7r/3p4/1k4P1/3R2K1 b - -',Wanting to stop the promotion.
418,10,52,4Rd4,b'8/8/8/5p2/3r4/3p4/1k4P1/3R2K1 w - -',But remembering what Jack Stockel Susan Polgar and archduke_piccolo told me I also put a stop to that by bringing my Rook behind the passed pawn (which is where it belongs.)
419,10,53,4Rd2+,b'8/8/8/5p2/3r4/3p4/1k1R2P1/6K1 b - -',Placing me in check.  But I know the strategy that is based on how I failed the course for the last several.  I think that Ted's hoping I'll answer with 43...Kb1 or 43...Ka1 and then he'd answer with 44.Rd1 and after playing the same move he'd respond again 44.Rd2+  This way the position would repeat itself until we have a draw by repetition.
420,10,54,4Kc1,b'8/8/8/5p2/3r4/3p4/3R2P1/2k3K1 w - -',Well knowing where I went wrong there I also stop this.  Now another option was 43...Kb3 (which I considered.)  But I wanted to add the overwhelming amount pressure against him because with this tempo gain the pawn is going to promote at once with now way to stop it.  That's because his Rook must go away from my d3 which is what I'm going to promote.  In another words a promotion is unstoppable at this point.
421,10,55,d2,b'8/8/8/5p2/3r4/8/3p1RP1/2k3K1 w - -',One reason being (which I calculated and kept in mind) is that stopping the passed pawn means losing the Rook which he doesn't want.  So I gave Ted another pawn which he captures.  And when he takes I'll promote.
422,10,56,d1=Q+,b'8/8/8/5R2/3r4/8/6P1/2kq2K1 w - -',Now unlike with N+B (which requires 3) there was only two steps here.  Generally speaking like the other lesson it's about forming a triangle after which the last step is the hardest.  But in this case while the first and last are the same the opposite is true (as the last is the easiest.)  Getting to this point was so hard that it was as though I had gotten into an argument.  I say that because similar to a feaud I had just as bad of a headache after this game.  It's unusual with just one game unless there difficult like this.  But in this case I had to take the level of gear up to it's max of 10 (which is almost impossibly hard) to figure this out.  But now I have an obtuse or isosoles triangle (going back to trigonometry.  And remember SohCahToa.    Well we have a cotagent since it's adjacent over opposite with the Queen being next to the monarch and opposite of that is the Rook.  And now I use that triangle and all that I've learned to force a mate since it is to follow.  
423,10,57,Rh4+,b'8/8/8/5R2/7r/8/6PK/2kq4 w - -',Taking advantage of that.  Worth noting that I'm doing a little twist to this thinking about transformations.  In the other mate it's not mentioned but it was trigonometry.  But on top of the triangle (that I mentioned) I calculate a lot of Algebraic Transformations in my games.  So what happened here is that I didn't do anything on the Y axis but I shifted my Rook across the X axis up by 4 units forcing his to come down the X axis by 1 unit and the Y axis by 1 unit.
424,10,58,Qg4+,b'8/8/8/5R2/6qr/6K1/6P1/2k5 w - -',Calculating that I'm going to win his Rook after forcing his next move.
425,10,59,Qxf5+,b'8/8/8/5q2/7r/8/5KP1/2k5 w - -',Now he has three choices to get out of check but all of them lead to mate.  And here's the conditional move.  If Ted answers with 49.Kg1 or 49.Ke1 I will automatically respond with 49...Qc2 to allow 50...Rd4 as afterwards 51....Rd1# would follow which is mate.
426,10,60,4Kg3,b'8/8/8/5q2/7r/6K1/6P1/2k5 b - -',?? But when he plays this however I mate at once.

I think if the rook had gone to f2 then this would have meant he could take the queen when it came up to f3 or g2.

446,12,3,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But she however does not.  The most common move is 3...exd4 after which white answers with 4.Nxd4  Because this did not happen I take.  But I was not going to say anything because it's not necessarily an inaccuracy.  In order for me to do so as per ION's advice it has to be an inaccurate or a mistake.  One thought that came to mind however is something that a more experienced would not have even considered interestingly enough.  With that being said 4.Nxe5?? also came into consideration with the idea being what you'd see if the Domiano's Defense.  But then I recalculated and with two pawns on both sides that sac would not work since 4...dxe5  Therefore I just take with my d4 immeidately. 
447,12,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',At first I was going to tell her that this is a mistake.  But I looked and realized that she can take back.  And as noted until it can be proven to be an error I won't say anything because the idea is still the same of making sure that the student gets the correct information.  The only problem is that she did get the wrong info here because I forgot to count who's ahead behind the point value.  Had this been calculated more carefully I would've realized that she lost a pawn.  When she takes back it appears even but 5.exd6 is +2 as opposed to +1.  This is where the calculation was faulty.
448,12,5,exd6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2nP1p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The real reason for playing this as opposed to 5.exf6 was to eliminate the doubled pawns.  I wasn't sure if they were a liablility here.  But when in doubt I infer that they are since I always see Jack doing that.  However I recently learned something in TA's thread.  Based on that I've come to the decision that this was indeed the best move.  He said that the one thing you don't want is doubled pawns right in the center as they often become problematic in the mid and endgames.  By playing this I eliminated this.  However had I played the other capture and she took back it would still be gone but that would be by exploiting the weaker pawn.  So I feel more comfortable with the move played.
449,12,6,Bb5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2nb1p2/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Meanwhile I waist no time in pinning Mary's Knight.  But it's not done just for the thrills of it.  I know that she'll break it with her next move (which is the most common method.)  And in doing so I'll be able to castle right after which is the real plan behind this pin.
450,12,7,Na5,b'r2qk1nr/pppb2pp/3b1p2/nB6/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',In general a Knight on the rim is grim.  But as per advise by bhidragon I'm slowly using the chess quotes less then less.  It will probably take years before they stop all together.  This appeared to lose something but there actually has to be proof of an error before I say anything.  The idea is that it's still better to not do enough then to coach too much as per what archduke_piccolo.  When I look further it does not as Mary can still defend.
451,12,8,Bxd7+,b'r2qk1nr/pppB2pp/3b1p2/n7/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile I decide to liquidate bishops due to being ahead.  Now I recently learned from TA that this isn't always a good idea just because you're ahead.  But against players that aren't as strong that's when they generally apply.
452,12,9,Bd2,b'r3k1nr/pppq2pp/3b1p2/n7/4P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',The other logic behind the exchange is that while Mary doesn't lose anything it allowed this move.  Even though it gets defended this move gains a tempo for white.

Although it's important to get out of the comfort zone I also bear in mind what elyhim of ""Stick with what you know.""  The only problem with this is that it is where I got into the bad habit of digging into those chess terms to guide my play when the more important idea is seeing the overall picture based on the story that the board is revealing."

I know that the idea was gaining tempo but this time she missed the overall picture.  However it starts off with her.  I was going to mention straight away that this is a blunder because of the next move.  As anticipated however she says something.  Normally I'd just point it out straight here but OTB is different then regular.  Therefore the idea is doing things the right things by teaching after the mistake and response is made.  The idea being is that if I do too much Jack Stockel will get involved and that would completely mess up the position.  In doing so I would not be able to annotate this game as per what happened in a different training session with this same student.

However this happened before Joe's advice and I wish it were afterwards.  He said that you shouldn't liquidate Queens just because you're a minor piece up.  Instead it should wait until you're at least a Rook ahead.  And usually it's more like a Rook and minor piece.  In addition I thought that exchanging was forced because anything else appeared to lose N or Q.  I overlooked however my e4.  But even so aside from Joe's advise I don't much wrong with this.  Next time however I might hold off on the Queen exchange because of what was presented in The Deeper Chess Theory Club.
465,12,22,1Ne6,b'3r3r/pk4pp/1p1bNp2/n1pN4/4P3/8/PPPB1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Knowing the advantage I decide to fork her g7 and Rd8.

I know that Mary wants to avoid further liquidation with what I won but it's better then losing an extra pawn.  So I said that better was to exchange.  And she nodded.  By exchange I was alluding to 18...Bxf4 and then I'd follow up with 19.Ndxf4. 
469,12,26,Kc6,b'7r/p2r3p/1pkbNN2/n1p3p1/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',?? I'm not sure why she played this.  But best was 19...Bxf4 after which I could still back.  By playing this I'll win her Rook for N.  Now I was going to say something but ION told me not to be overcritical when you're winning.  Plus I was once again worried about Jack's involvement.  In addition I was calculating ways that she might be able to get it back.  But in the end after the game ends I tie everything in including this mistake and an overall moral since she overlooked my next move.
470,12,27,2Bxd6,b'7r/p2k3p/1p1BN3/n1p3p1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I almost played 21.Nxg5 but this is the move that would've won back material.  And that was also one of the reasons I didn't say anything right away about 19...Kc6??  Play it wrong and she wins back a piece for pawn.  I couldn't allow that because if I'm not at the best she isn't going to learn.  The idea is to teach chess in it's most difficult form.
471,12,28,2Rad1,b'7r/p6p/1p1Bk3/n1p3p1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',I could've retreated my Bd6 but decide to centralize my other Rook.  Part of the long term plan btw is to double up since it's generally a good idea.
472,12,29,2Nc6,b'7r/p6p/1pnBk3/2p3p1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Now she bring her N out of the rim.  And knowing that it moved this where I also figured out that 11...Nec6 was played as opposed to 11...Nac6  That's because in OTB chess all of that calculation is important to get the accurate recording on how it was played.

Without much more I can give as per what ION said there's no more advice for now.  Although the move is a blunder I don't see any good move for Mary at this point.
478,12,35,2Kf1,b'3r4/p6p/1p1Bk3/2pR2p1/4P3/2P5/PP2nPPP/3R1K2 b - -',26.Kh1 was also an option because Jack previously said to bring the monarch in the corner.  But this is where I think of what bhidragon said in terms of the story that the board reveals.  That's because the overall picture is that this is the move that wins the Knight because wherever it goes I take.  And that's also the significance removing the guard since this actually does that in such a way that black can't avoid the further loss of material.
479,12,36,gxf4,b'3r4/p6p/1p2k3/2pR4/4Pp2/2P5/PP3PPP/3R1K2 w - -',?? Mary thought that she won back a piece.  But this however is the move I kept in mind because by playing this...

Normally I'd say no since I teach my students to stay in until mate can be forced.  But I kept in mind what Jack Stockel once outlined and that was combined with what reversion and kenneth_fiore_3 said which is that it's safe.  So I said yes by telling her that this is a resignable position.  After this game we played another which I'll annotate.  Didn't do as well and that game timed out since we ran out of time.  But after the first one I tied in all of Mary's mistake including 19...Kc6??  But it was about what boiled down those mistakes and general moral which is how I teach chess.  And I used what cplusplus11 outlined which was also mentioned in my third training session with reachforgoals and one of her annotations as well as in a couple of Edna's annotations.  In it I told her that the lesson to be learned from this game is looking out for all threats made by your opponent.  I also outlined something based on her thought process from 25.Ne2+ based reachforgoals mistake which I saw in one of her recent annotations.  It was don't just check for the thrills of it.  I'm sure that if Mary can remember these lessons she will improve her play.

Possibly White wanted to keep open the diagonal for the f1-bishop.  In that case she might instead have played 8.Bb5 with 9.Nge2 to follow.  The line might have gone 8.Bb5 a6  9.Ba4 ... (9.Bxc6!? might tend to suit Black better) 9...Nf6  10.Nge2.  White can then follow with Bb3 and Nf4 adding to the pressure against Black's d-pawn.

But it is Black to play...

Instead 15.Bxe4 not only walked away with a pawn on account of the rook's pin on the d-file but would have brought additional pressure against Black's centre and K-side.  E.g. 15.Bxe4 Nf6 16.Bd3 ... 17.Rag1.  
520,14,19,1Bf1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp4p/2n3p1/3p3n/8/P1Q1PpBP/1PP4P/2KR1B1R b - -',This must have been an annoying retreat shutting in the King's Rook.
521,14,20,Qf6,b'r4rk1/ppp4p/2n2qp1/3p4/8/P1Q1PpPP/1PP5/2KR1B1R w - -',Offering a pawn after the queens come off (18.Qxf6 Rxf6  19.Rxd5 ...).  Probably 17...Qg5 was the more promising protecting the d-pawn and eyeing White's g-pawn not to mention the White King.
522,14,21,1Qd3,b'r4rk1/ppp4p/2n2qp1/3p4/8/P2QPpPP/1PP5/2KR1B1R b - -',Probably White was better advised to take the offered Q exchange and the pawn sweetener that came with it.  Having said that White has made a judgement call that suggested 'keep the Queens on'.  In that case 18.Qd2 looks the better option keeping open the bishop's diagonal to b5 or c4 as occasion indicates.  It would also have saved a tempo in the game!
523,14,22,1Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/ppp4p/2n2qp1/3p4/8/P2QPpPP/1PP5/2KR1B1R w - -',Right idea but this looks to be the wrong rook.  This is sometimes one of the hardest decisions to be found in chess: 'Which rook?' to place on a given file.  GM J.R. Capablanca lost his first game in defence of the World Championship against A. Alekhine through a mistaken choice.  Here the a8-rook is not doing anything; the f8-rook is.  So ...Rad8 was indicated.
524,14,23,d4,b'r2r2k1/ppp4p/2n2qp1/8/3p4/P3PpPP/1PPQ4/2KR1B1R w - -',Good move: annihilating the remnants of White's centre.

527,14,26,2Re8,b'4r3/ppp3kp/5qp1/8/2Bn2P1/P4p1P/1PP5/2KQ3R w - -',I like 24...Rd8 threatening ...Ne2ch or ...Nb3ch.

529,14,28,2c3,b'3r1k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Bn1qP1/P1P2p1P/1P6/1K2QR2 b - -',At the expense of weakening the light squares White drives back the enemy knight.  This was a very good decision as after 28...Nc6 29.Qe6 White threatens to force a perpetual check.  If Black averts that by 29...Ne7 then 30.Qe2! wins back Black's dangerous passed pawn: 30...fxe2!? 31.Rxf4ch Ke8 32.Bxe2 (32.Bf7ch? leads nowhere if Black is sufficiently alert).  Instead 29...Re8 30.Qg8ch Ke7 31.Qe6ch Kf8 (31...Kd8 32.Rd1ch and White wins) 32.Qg8ch (=).

The immediate question is has Black overlooked the chance to win a piece?  After 29...Qxc4 30.Rxf3ch Kg7 31.Re3 ... how is the knight to be defended?  The obvious move is 31...Nf4 32.Re7ch Kg8  33.Qe5 ... the threats by White's two active pieces look good enough to draw but Black's pieces are also active: 33... Rd1ch 34.Kc2 Qd3ch  35.Kb3 Qd5ch!  By forcing the exchange of queens Black could have retained the extra piece.  That was indeed a chance missed though it would have required calculation 7 moves deep to determine - with trial and practice it becomes not too difficult a task for a forcing line like this.
533,14,32,3Bxe2,b'5k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/5qP1/P1P2p1P/1P1rBR2/1K2Q3 b - -',Clever move but incorrect as it turns out.  The right move was 30.Rxf3! Qxf3 31.Qxd2 ... Despite the equality of material White emerges with an advantage good enough to win:  31.Nf4 32.Qd8ch Kg7 33.Ka2 Nxa3 34.g5! ... whereupon the threat of mate forces Black to give up his knight: 34...Nxg6 35.Qxg5.

Black could have won the game by 30...Qe4ch 31.Ka1 (or 31.Ka2 makes no difference) ...Rxe2 and White must lose material.  Probably best hopeless as it was would have been 32.Rxf3ch but White would be in a major piece endgame a rook down.

536,14,35,Qg3,b'5k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/6P1/P1P3qP/1P2Q3/1K6 w - -',[=] Queen end games are notoriously tricky and hard to win.  The position here would probably be abandoned as a draw in top flight chess as the pawn formations are entirely symmetrical: 3-3 and 2-2 on the flanks no passed pawn not even any 'candidates' (by which I mean a pawn that is not 'passed' but has no enemy pawn directly in front of it).  All the same there are some lessons to be learned from the sequel and interesting moments as well.
537,14,36,3c4,b'5k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2P3P1/P5qP/1P2Q3/1K6 b - -',[?!] Already a slight mistake I think as Black could at once have taken the h-pawn.  That probably should not have been enough to win but... it would have given Black something to work on.
538,14,37,Qd4,b'5k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Pq2P1/P6P/KP2Q3/8 w - -',Centralising.  Usually a good idea.  It has to be admitted that winning a pawn in these sorts of endings often comes at the cost of deflecting the Queen to a flank.  If the opponent can centralise his/her queen that might be enough to maintain a balance.
539,14,38,3b3,b'5k2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2Pq2P1/PP5P/K3Q3/8 b - -',Relieving the Queen of guard duties.  I still might have preferred 35.Qe6 myself but I'm not sure it makes all that much difference.

In what follows there will some lengthy sequences in which not much happens but they are easy to understand.  We'll pause when things get more exciting.
541,14,40,3Qg3,b'8/pp2k2p/6p1/2p5/2Pq2P1/PP4QP/K7/8 b - -',As the b-pawn could have been taken with check it would have been worth doing so.  Black would have had split pawn on the Q-side to protect which might have been enough to tie it down for White to make progress.
542,14,41,3Qd7,b'8/pp1qk2p/6p1/2p5/2P3P1/PP4QP/K7/8 w - -',[?] The Queen was well placed on d4 or Black could have forced an immediate draw by inescapable checks on d2 and d1.
543,14,42,3Qf2,b'8/pp1qk2p/6p1/2p5/2P3P1/PP5P/K4Q2/8 b - -',And now Qe5ch could have forced the win of the c-pawn - though Black could have forced a draw in response.  It should be said right here that White can not afford to exchange Queens - not whilst Black's king is so much closer the K-side than White's is.  With the White King so remotely placed the pawn end game (i.e. absent the queens) is winning for Black.  
544,14,43,Kf7,b'8/pp3k1p/4q1p1/2Q5/2P3P1/PP5P/K7/8 w - -',Interesting move!  If now 39.Qd5?! Qxd5 40.cxd5 ... the extra pawn is worth no more than a draw for White.  Black has to go after the isolated passed pawn which can not be defended but it would give the White King time enough to get to the centre files himself.

White would then have had some chances - however slender for the passed a-pawn has a long way to go - of going for the win.  Possession of a passed pawn often makes the decisive difference in Queen and pawn end games.
555,14,54,Qc3+,b'8/Qp3k1p/6p1/8/6P1/P1q4P/8/K7 w - -',55....Qd1ch would have permitted White to claim a draw by threefold repetition (of the position).

The King should now be trying to advance up the board to give his queen and pawn a helping hand.  62.Ka3 would have been fine.  Bear in mind the King is in no danger from the lone queen provided he stays off the g1-a7 diagonal (especially on the four centre files though the King should probably travel no farther west than the c-file anyhow.).
559,14,58,Qd1+,b'8/Q6p/P6k/8/6p1/8/8/1K1q4 w - -',In all this White should really have kept her king off the back rank for three reasons: [1] freedom; [2] to obviate the possibility of promotion with check; and [3] the main reason because when Black checks on the back rank the queen also covers the queening square.  Had the White King advanced up the board or at least stayed off the back rank Black would have had to try for the perpetual and a draw or else risk a tempo to achieve promotion.  Bear in mind here that White's a-pawn can not be stopped from promoting (once White plays Qb7) now other than by continual checking - or giving up the Black Queen.
560,14,59,7Qb6+,b'8/7p/PQ5k/8/8/6p1/K7/3q4 b - -',79.Qe3ch offered more ways for Black to go wrong - always worth a consideration if all other things are equal!

It is all too easy in situations like this when you feel you have the draw in hand and you could keep on checking (or being checked) forever to forget that there are hazards in any position.  White's King successfully avoided the perils of the a- and b-files and the g1-h7 diagonal where sharp stakes - skewers - abounded.  But Now Black walks into a deadly half-pin...
566,14,65,9Kd2,b'Q7/7p/1Q6/7k/6q1/8/3K2p1/8 b - -',[??] ... and White returns the compliment.  The right move was 90.Qf3! ... forcing the exchange of one pair of queens and leaving White with a winning endgame Queen versus two pawns - no one pawn (90.Qf3 Qxf3ch 91.Kxf3 and picks up the g-pawn next move).
567,14,66,9Qxg1,b'Q7/7p/8/7k/6q1/8/3K4/6Q1 b - -',Although Black emerges a pawn ahead the position is a safe draw after this.  But White might still have tried exploiting the awkward placing of the Black queens by playing 91.Qe8ch.  For example after 91.Qe8ch Kg5?? 92.Qxg1 Qxg1 93.Qg8ch skewers the Black King and Queen and wins.  So: 91.Qe8ch Kh4  92.Qh6ch Kg3  93.Qe5ch ... At this point Black might escape the checks by ...Kf2 or ...Kg2 but 93...Kf3?? 94.Qe2ch Kg3  95.Qxg4ch Kxg4 96.Qg7ch and another skewer.

I have 4 pawns while black has 7 with doubled pawns on 2 files c and f files.  So would that equate to 5 pawns I don't know.  I suppose if I manage to take the first doubled pawn then he has the other to come down still.  Altogether I think it was a bit of a close game.  Sure you will let me know what you think.

I have a square I can go to at b4 which would give me an attack on white's LB.  White still has 2 pieces not developed and I have my LB yet to be developed.
703,18,11,Nxb4,b'r1bq1rk1/p3b1pp/1p1p1n2/2p1p3/1nP1P3/3B1P2/P3N1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',White pushes his b pawn and I capture it with my B knight.  I am attacking his LB at d3.

I move my F knight to h5 threatening g3 and attacking his rook although he can capture with his h pawn or the knight at e2.  I can also move my knight to f4 protected by my pawn at e5 so if the knight captures I will recapture.
706,18,14,Nd4,b'r1bq1rk1/p3b1pp/1p1p4/2p1p2n/2PnP3/B1N2P2/P1B1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',White moves his LB to c2 and I move my C knight to d4 attacking pawn at f3 and LB  but white has a knight at d2 which could capture it but this would be recaptured by my pawns at c5 or e5.

This leaves me with doubled pawns on the d file but I quite like this set up with one pawn on e5 and a pawn on squares d4 and d6.  I find this can be a nice blockade.
708,18,16,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/p5pp/1p1p4/3Np1bn/2PpP3/B4P2/P1B3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',White now moves his knight attacking my DB at e7 but I move my DB to g5 protected by queen at d8.

Once the king moves I have an option to take the rook but it is protected by the queen so I may not do this.  However should the rook decide to capture my rook at f8 then I will recapture the rook with my a rook.
719,18,27,Bg5,b'r4rk1/p6p/1p1p2p1/4q1b1/2Pp2P1/B2B1R1P/P7/R2Q3K w - -',White king moves out of check and I retreat my DB to g5.  There was no option for me to bring in my queen sitting at e5 as I could not connect my bishop and my queen to make an attack possible.
720,18,28,Rxf8,b'5rk1/p6p/1p1p2p1/4q1b1/2Pp2P1/B2B3P/P7/R2Q3K w - -',As expected white moves rook up to take rook at f8 and I retake with my a8 rook.

722,18,30,Rxa2,b'6k1/p6p/1p1p2p1/4q1b1/2Pp2P1/B2B3P/r7/1R4QK w - -',White moves the queen across to g1 to protect the king and I take advantage and capture the pawn at a2.  This allows me to control the row while at a distance from the queen's capture.

725,18,33,Ra5,b'6k1/p6p/1p1p2p1/r3q3/2Pp2P1/4b2P/6Q1/1B2R2K w - -',So white moves the queen out to g2 and I move my rook to a5 supporting the queen at e5.  I could have captured the queen on my last move but it was protected by the rook so I would have lost my only piece the DB so decided to retreat my rook.
726,18,34,Kg7,b'Q7/p5kp/1p1p2p1/r3q3/2Pp2P1/4b2P/8/1B2R2K w - -',Now white checks my king with Qa8 and I move king out of check to g7.
727,18,35,Kh6,b'8/pQ5p/1p1p2pk/r3q3/2Pp2P1/4b2P/8/1B2R2K w - -',Queens continues to harrass my king with further check Qb7 and I now move my king out of harms way to h6.
728,18,36,b5,b'8/p6p/3p2pk/rp2q3/2Pp2P1/4b2P/6Q1/1B2R2K w - -',So white moves queen back to g2 to assist in defending the king and I move pawn to b5 attacking pawn at c4.  My pawn is protected by both queen and rook.
729,18,37,Qxg5,b'8/p6p/3p2pk/rp4q1/2Pp4/4b2P/6Q1/1B2R2K w - -',White moves g pawn to g5 attacking the king at h6.  I take the pawn with my queen and now the queens are facing one another on the g file.
730,18,38,Kxg5,b'8/p6p/3p2p1/rp4k1/2Pp4/4b2P/8/1B2R2K w - -',White captures the black queen and I capture the white queen with my king.  Now we are at the end game for sure and I have 6 pawns over my opponents 2 but otherwise we have the same pieces 1 bishop and 1 rook.  Although our bishops are opposites as I have DB and white has LB.
731,18,39,bxc4,b'8/p6p/3p2p1/r5k1/2pp4/4b2P/4R3/1B5K w - -',So white moves rook to e2 and I take white's pawn at c4.
732,18,40,c3,b'8/p6p/3p2p1/r5k1/3pB3/2p1b2P/4R3/7K w - -',White moves his LB to e4 probably looking to capture the d pawn if it attempts to move to the light square at d3 and same for c pawn moving to c2.  I move pawn to c3.
733,18,41,Ra1+,b'8/p6p/3p2p1/6k1/3p4/2pBb2P/4R3/r6K w - -',Now white's LB moves to stop d pawn moving and attempt to capture c pawn if it tries to push to c2.  I check the white king with rook to a1.
734,18,42,h5,b'8/p7/3p2p1/6kp/3p4/2pBb2P/4R1K1/r7 w - h6',King moves out of check and I push pawn to h5.

737,18,45,Rd2,b'8/p7/3p2p1/6kp/3pK3/2p1b2P/2Rr4/8 w - -',White king moves to e4 attacking rook at d3 which moves to d2 and has the white rook at c2 but if it should take my c3 pawn will capture the rook.
738,18,46,cxd2,b'8/p7/3p2p1/6kp/3pK3/4b2P/3p4/8 w - -',As expected white capture my rook and I recaptured at d2.  White resigned as only had a pawn left at h3 which was blocked.

What usually happens in these games is that I do ok for twenty to thirty moves then I make a mistake and it all rapidly falls apart. This game was different for a number of reasons. Firstly we followed book for much longer than I normally would secondly this is the longest game I have ever played against such a high ranked player thirdly it turned into a bit of a ding dong battle if only in terms of material finally a draw would normally feel like a win for me in these circumstances but this one didn't if anything it felt like a loss. 

I hope this game inspires you to not give up when playing much higher ranked players"

The only way to shift it quickly is f5 but I can't see that happening here as it would open blacks King too much
742,19,3,1Kg7,b'1rbbr3/1pp2pk1/p3n1pp/2PNp3/4N3/4P1P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 w - -',Prevents the fork and defends f6

758,19,19,4Kd3,b'3n4/1p6/p1p5/N1Pkpp1p/1P5P/3K1PP1/8/8 b - -',So now our knights are both tied up and although I am outnumbered on the queenside blacks pawns can't easily make progress. I think it was around this point that I offered a draw. This can be high risk against such highly ranked players as it can push them into going up a gear. As he declined he clearly felt he could win. As my end game isn't great I have to be even more careful from now on

771,19,32,5Kd6,b'8/1N6/p2K4/1PP4k/1n6/8/8/8 b - -',I think kb6 was preferable here. Around this point I realised I needed to try to prevent a draw

Afterall this is why he wanted the tourney.  The idea being is that 1.e4 e5 and 1.e4 c5 are my main openings.  So the idea is learning through different moves.  Therefore although rare I answer with the 2 Knights Opening.
810,21,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This has now become the Four Knights Defense.

812,21,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I understand why he brought the N out but don't know why he didn't play 4...Bb5  At that point I wouldn't know what to do. 
813,21,4,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Generally speaking ...Bc5?! is considered an inaccuracy because white can generally follow through on the c2-d4 which is c3 and then d4.  But in the context of this game that is not possible due to my Nc3 blocking my c pawn.  So I castle instead which is the thing I like to do early anyhow.
814,21,5,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',He has the same idea in mind.  However I'm going to take on e5.  Normally I don't because the original idea was just to double his pawns.  And in the Ruy Lopez it's considered not very effective.  But I took here because when he takes back I will get a pawn this time around.
815,21,6,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',At first I thought that he was trying to win my pawn.  But I quickly realized that it's defended by my Nc3.
816,21,7,Nd3,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/4P3/2NN4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',?! So I reattack in the process.  But this is an inaccuracy as he goes after my Queen in return.  Afterwhich I have no idea what to do.
817,21,8,Bd4,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/3bP1b1/2NN4/PPPP1PPP/R1B1QRK1 w - -',I thought that he was trying to exchange my Nc3 for B.  That is what he wants afterall.  I decline to avoid having doubled pawns forgetting a lesson from TA.  Turns out that doubled pawns would not have been of an asset here.  The big picture is that he wants because if I accept it black will win back a pawn with ...Nxe4 since my Nc3 is no longer around and due to his Re8 I would not be able to recapture.  I find that out on the next move.
818,21,9,1Ne2,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/3bP1b1/3N4/PPPPNPPP/R1B1QRK1 b - -',? Not only does he get the pawn back but by playing this he will be able to tie down my Ne2 in the process which leaves in rough shape.  One thing you don't want is your own pieces restricted like this.  Much better was to accept the exchange and yes it's where hyperfocusing on the small things becomes costly. 
819,21,10,1c3,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/3br1b1/2PN4/PP1PNPPP/R1B1QRK1 b - -',"?? If my f2 weren't pinned I would've played 11.f3 to pin his Bg4 and Re4.  Since it is I try to come up with something different by attacking his Bd4.  This however is the losing blunder as now black will win a piece without compensation due to the pinning motif.  I actually studied a similar with GM Susan Polgar in the book ""Chess Tactics for Champions.""  "
820,21,11,1Qd1,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/3b2b1/2PN4/PP1PrPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',At this point however I thought that I was safe.  But that isn't so because what I overlooked is that when he takes on f2 white has a discovered attack on my Queen.  That will not only win a pawn but he will force liquidation while behind.  Plus my King will become badly exposed.
821,21,12,1Qb3,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/3b2b1/1QPN4/PP1P1rPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Thinking that I had some fight left I go after b7.  I thought he'd defend anyhow but instead forces the liquidation and as noted leaves my monarch exposed.  In addition I missed what the board was indicating similar to my game against bhidragon.  That's because I knew his pieces were damaging but thought that in a sense they were useless.  By useless I meant that I didn't they he could use them to deliver mate in this position.  I was planning on how to counter that.  But his pieces are much worse then they appear.
822,21,13,Ne4,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/8/3bn1b1/1QPN4/PP1P2PP/R1B2K2 w - -',Organizing his pieces for the mate.
823,21,14,1cxd4,b'r2q2k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/8/3Pn1b1/1Q1N4/PP1P2PP/R1B2K2 b - -',?? This is where I really go wrong as now it's mate.  I knew that his B and N would work together.  But it's not a B and N mate since I've got material to.  Without showing off I thought that if he wanted to mate with just two pieces black will have to try harder.  In other words I'd have defenses when he tries.  That was also wrong because once he brings the Queen in it's game over.
824,21,15,1h3,b'r5k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/8/3qn1b1/1Q1N3P/PP1P2P1/R1B2K2 b - -',?? Thinking that it would be virtually impossible to mate me right away I kick his B since I felt that he was using for the devastating attack.  That was wrong because of...
825,21,16,1Ng3+,b'r5k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/8/3q2b1/1Q1N2nP/PP1P2P1/R1B2K2 w - -',This move.  At first I was thinking along the same lines.  My initial thought was that once I'd get out of check I would have some counter play.  Turns out that it isn't.  I was attempting to play through variations but the reality is that 17.Ke1 is forced after which 17...Qg1# is a back rank mate.  The lesson to be learned is that seeing the overall picture requires more then it looks.  It's not just thinking about what the board is telling you or thinking about what the opponent but also calculating through them.  For example I must start thinking after the check like not just ok I have a way out.  But something like and yes what happens afterwards when getting out of check and what other pieces can be used into the fray of arrays I guess you can say.  Had this been done I would've played better and lasted longer.
826,22,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',This is a game I played recently against kldr. I actually lost my queen in this game due to playing one night with one too many beers :). At any rate I resumed playing the next day and was able to make the comeback. If anything this serves as an example never to resign even if you lost a piece in error or in my case too many ale's. 
827,22,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Condensing this annotation somewhat- Normally I would not open black this way with the pawn advancing to D5 typically I start with Pawn to C5 but at any rate after the pawn moves white moves pawn to H3 which I think was a not a good choice for development. Black responds with NF6
828,22,2,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',White moves NF3 Black responds with Ne4. I could of developed another piece rather than this response but if you notice black knight has a great position here for the time being. There are minimal threats to the black knight pending whites additional moves. If white moves his knight to advance his pawn to F3 Black can move to KG3 and fork the bishop and rook. Alternatively the other moves will end in a swap

Why did I do that and risk loosing black's most powerful bishop and already being down -6? The reason is white has a decision to make and even though I will loose the bishop this allows for black to take white pawn on G3 and check the King or alternatively advance Ne3 to fork the white queen and rook. So a sacrifice but for better options

2.White has an early weak Knight move with loss of point value. Flank positioning of any Knight move early in the game is positional unsound development. 
3.Central pawn development is good for white initially as he proceeded to do but failed at the proper ""support"" of those central pawns with other major pieces and/or f or c pawn support. 
4.Too early Queens moves for white began his downfall. 
5.White was simply not prepared to counter blacks WELL PREPARED Basman defense opening which BECAME tactically OFFENSIVE in nature against whites improper developing moves. 

So this weaker defense was a game of psychology which quickly in 11 moves overcame whites POTENTIAL opening superiority. Yes white can maintain an edge.....but must know HOW to maintain that edge in tempo and initiative! 

So this win of mine goes much deeper than simply a 2400 player brutalizing a 1500 player. It illustrates the sudden turning of the tide in 11 moves with a defense that is weaker than say a Sicilian defense but can have even more sting to those who travel into murky uncharted waters with no water map playing against this defense that moves OUT OF BOOK rather quickly from the onset. 

By the way.... 

Notice in the final diagram above where Whites Knight is still positioned on h4kind of protecting that g2 pawn of his but still semi frozen and a obvious decrease in piece point value? 

Yes the Basman can have devastating results to the unprepared. And my opponent found this out in 11 moves of terror confusion and bewilderment.""

1009,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I began with g3 ready to bring my LB to g7 and black went with e5.

1018,26,10,Qd7,b'rn3rk1/pppqbppp/3p4/4p3/4P1n1/3P1BPb/PPPR1P1P/RNBQ2K1 w - -',I move my rook to d2 to allow the queen to move up better positioned to assist and get involved in the game. Black moves the queen back down to d7.
1019,26,11,Nc6,b'r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np4/4p3/4P1n1/3P1BPb/PPPRQP1P/RNB3K1 w - -',Now I move my queen up to e2 supporting my pawns and pieces around the queen.  Black develops his knight to f6.

1029,26,21,Rxe3,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/2n2n2/3p4/1b1N4/2P1r1Pb/P2R1PBP/R1B3K1 w - -',I now decide to exchange LB's so move my LB to g2 with black's LB at h3.  I do not want the queen to come down so would hope that black may take my LB but probably not likely.  I should instead have moved my queen and can't really say why I didn't.  And now the rook at e8 captures my queen at e3.
1030,26,22,Ne4,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/2n5/3p4/1b1Nn3/2P1r1Pb/PB1R1PBP/R5K1 w - -',Needless to say I still have my LB and will not take black's as I don't want the queen coming down and attacking my king.  So I now develop my DB and allow my a1 rook to access the rest of the 1st row.  Black moves his f rook to d4 attacking my d2 rook.
1031,26,23,Nxd2,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/2n5/3p4/1b1N4/2P1P1Pb/PB1n2BP/R5K1 w - -',I take black's rook at e3 and black captures my rook at d2.
1032,26,24,Bd6,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/2nb4/3p4/3N4/2P1P1Pb/PB1n2BP/2R3K1 w - -',I move my rook along where I can protect a pawn at c3 and be protected by the DB at b2.
1033,26,25,Nc4,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/2nb4/3p4/2nN4/2P1P1Pb/PB4BP/4R1K1 w - -',My pieces are not easy to move into good positions.  The rook has the knight at e2 so i have to watch where I place the rook.  There is a rook at f8 so I don't want to place the rook at f1.  My DB is at b2 blocked by its own pawn at c3 and if it goes to a3 then black's DB is at d6.  I want my LB to stay at g2 because there is a pawn at d5 which I want to check the king with however there has never been a time when I can take it without black's knight being at f6 and the queen at d6.  My knight at d4 can go to f5 but the LB and queen are on that diagonal so its limited.  So I move my rook across to e1 and black knight goes up to c4 as there is nothing for him to capture from d2.  Now he can capture my DB at b2.
1034,26,26,Nc6e5,b'5rk1/pppq2pp/3b4/3pn3/2nN4/2P1P1Pb/P5BP/2B1R1K1 w - -',I now move my DB onto c1 and hope to find a better position for this piece.  Black moves his c6 knight to e4 attacking the f3 square and g4 square.
1035,26,27,Qa4,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3b4/3pn3/q1nN4/2P1P1Pb/P6P/2B1RBK1 w - -',I now move my bishop down to f1 protected by my rook at e1.  Black moves his queen to a4.
1036,26,28,dxc4,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3b4/4n3/q1pN4/2P1P1Pb/P6P/2B1R1K1 w - -',My pawns are all isolated and my pieces are not helping each other.  I now decide to move my LB to c4 to capture the knight at least there is only one knight now so they can't work together.  I think I see the LB at h3 as not doing anything useful so not worth capturing.  Black captures my LB at c4.  This is really funny because this is the pawn I was hoping to capture with my LB.
1037,26,29,Nd3,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3b4/8/q1pNP3/2Pn2Pb/P6P/2B1R1K1 w - -',I push my pawn to e4 and black moves his knight to d3 attacking both my DB and rook.
1038,26,30,Bxe6,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3bb3/8/q1p1P3/2Pn2P1/P6P/2B1R1K1 w - -',I decide to move my knight to e6 nearer to the king although I have nothing to support an attack as yet.  I forgot about the LB at h3 which now proceeds to capture my knight.
1039,26,31,Nxe1,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3bb3/8/q1p1P3/2P3P1/P2B3P/4n1K1 w - -',In expectation of capture of one of the pieces at c1 and e1 by the knight I move my DB to d2 so as to recapture the knight.
1040,26,32,Bh3,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3b4/8/q1p1P3/2P3Pb/P6P/4B1K1 w - -',I capture the knight and black's LB annoyingly returns to his guarding duties!
1041,26,33,Qd1+,b'5rk1/ppp3pp/3b4/8/2p1P3/2P3Pb/P2B3P/3q2K1 w - -',I move my only piece the DB. to d2 to get on the diagonal and black's queen comes to d1 to check the king and with the rook at f8 I know that the game is up and its time to give in to black's unquestionable superiority.
1042,27,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',My opponent allowed she wanted to practise playing the Colle System.  I thought I would respond with a mutual Queen's Pawn opening but I could equally well have played just about anything else.
1043,27,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',But this is not a Colle.  It is called the Richter Opening: quite playable but leading to an entire different type of game.  instead the Colle System goes... well we'll see how it goes...
1044,27,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Consistent with the idea of playing a Colle but rather a conservative line.  I half expected White to play 3.Bg5 - the Veresov Attack.  You might notice that the thing would have looked like a left-handed Ruy Lopez: quite playable.  Otherwise White might have played a quiet developing line like 3.Nf3 or even something wild and woolly: 3.e4!? the dreaded Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (3.e4 dxe4 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3 ... with quick development for White).  Developing players wishing to hone their attacking skills could do worse than try out the Blackmar-Diemer.
1045,27,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',My opponent having inadvertently slipped off the Colle line I figured I would play the System as if I had the White pieces.  Hence my choices for the next several moves.
1046,27,4,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Except for the 'misplaced' knight at c3 White has stayed with the Colle set up.  Now she figures the time is right for the plotted breakout.
1047,27,5,e4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Good move and this is the point of the Colle.  White threatens to advance the pawn to e5 (the double attack on knight and bishop is a bonus) at the same time freeing the dark-square bishop.  White often starts thinking about K-side attack from here on.
1048,27,6,dxe4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/8/3Pp3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Pretty much forced if Black doesn't want the pawn to continue to e5.  Believe you me he doesn't!
1049,27,7,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Changing the guard at f6 and gaining a tempo.  But you might already be noticing something about Black's light-square bishop.  Where is it going?  Its scope is pretty limited.  Recalling that Black has been playing a 'colours reversed' Colle system we see here the downside of the System if the e-pawn doesn't make it to the fourth rank.  The c8-bishop won't be developed for another seven moves...
1050,27,8,h6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2pbpn1p/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Not a very good move.  Normally I hold this sort of thing back until an enemy piece lands on g5 and then I might hit it with the ...h6 move.  But take a look at Whites Queen and bishops.  Their focus is very much on the K-side.  It seemed to me as well to keep the White minor pieces back for the time being whilst I completed my development.
1051,27,9,Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/ppq2pp1/2pbpn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',A little bit of a counter action: eyeing h2.  Already Black was planning to fianchetto the c8-bishop and was considering castling on that wing as well.
1052,27,10,1Qe2,b'r1b1k2r/ppq2pp1/2pbpn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',OK...ish...! But I really thought that 12.Qd2 was more in keeping aiming the guns towards the K-side.  To illustrate the potential for K-side operations had White played Qd2 and Black castled this might have happened: 12.Qd2 0-0  13.Bxh6!? gxh6 14.Qxh6 Be7 (defending the attacked Knight) 15.Ng5 Qd8 16.Bh7ch Kh8 (NOT 16...Nh7 17.Qxh7#) 17.Bg6 Kg8 18.Bh7ch ... and a draw by threefold repetition.  If a snap attack like that was good enough to draw the game who knows what White might have developed with more preparation?

But this sortie is premature and costs a pawn.  Not disastrous White does obtain some compensatory activity for her developed pieces.  But better would have been to bring the rooks into more active positions (C- d- or e-files) and/or to play 13.c4.
1055,27,13,1Qf3,b'r1b1k2r/p4pp1/1pp1pn1p/4q3/8/3BBQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Good: attacks the undefended c-pawn.

Ne7 (keeping guard over the c6-pawn)  17.Rb1 0-0  18.Bd2 ... (relocating) 18...Rd8 19.Bc3 Qg5.  Although a pawn behind White would have got quite a lively sort of game.

1059,27,17,1Bd2,b'r3k2r/pb3pp1/1pp1p2p/3nq3/8/3B1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',A change of mind that should have cost a tempo and a pawn.  But White has discovered that her pieces are in a little bit of a tangle.  Probably Rb1 or c3 would have enabled White quickly to unravel her Q-side.  Otherwise it is hard to tell whether this was an oversight or White figuring that to get her pieces working properly was worth dropping a second pawn.
1060,27,18,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pb3pp1/1pp1p2p/3nq3/8/3B1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Doesn't matter:  Black doesn't take the b2-pawn!  There was no particular reason not to do so but I think I was simply anxious to get my own development completed.  After all I am a pawn ahead!
1061,27,19,1c3,b'r4rk1/pb3pp1/1pp1p2p/3nq3/8/2PB1Q2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Understandable but it does have its risks mainly on account of the bishops on the d-file having no shelter there.  Black at once starts menacing them.

The bishops could have been defended by tactical means: 20.Rad1! ... when 20...Nxc3?? doesn't work: 21.Bxc3 and suddenly the d3-bishop is quite comfortable and snug thank you very much!

Black is planning to treble the heavy pieces on the d-file; and this rook also protects the bishop.  Black is planning soon to unmask the b7-bishop's battery against the White Queen and that of the heavy pieces against the bishop at d2.  Throughout this game so far Black has been playing a solid more or less risk-free positional style in the face of the active White pieces.

1078,27,36,Nd5,b'6k1/p4pp1/b1r1p2p/2pn4/8/PP2QP1P/6PK/5r2 w - -',Black is making sure everything is protected (When ahead 'Think defence'.  That does not mean 'play defensively' though...)

After the loss of the second pawn White began to lose ground.  It was not until move 20 that Black could point to an edge of any sort and moves 26 and 27 that the collapse really began.

(It is most likely that this move will lead to the Scotch Game or even ... the Scotch Gambit.) It is certainly completely playable and abides by all the opening principles.

(Hitting White's Bishop.) We now have transposed to a Scotch Opening. This is actually the most common response today but in the time of Morphy it was unheard of. One of many ways Morphy played ahead of his time.

1117,29,15,3Ke3,b'8/5pk1/5p2/pp1N1b1p/8/P1P1KP2/1P4PP/8 b - -',The White King appears fully able to penetrate the Queenside and capture the pawn island to force a victory rather quickly.  The GK computer gives Black up for lost at 14...Qf6 but there is more to the position.  Analysis of the game with a better chess engine might prove interesting.

Black moved his f6 knight to h5 attacking my DB at f4.  He could have captured my knight with his knight at d7 but he would have been recaptured by my pawn at d4 and my DB at f4.

Black moved his DB to e7 in front of his king and he now has access to 2 diagonals one to a3 and one to h3.
1129,30,11,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/4P3/2p2P2/P1N2P2/1P2B1PP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I push my pawn to a3 and black castles.

I move my king over to h2 and out of check.  Black moves rook down to f4 and this file is protected by my rook at f1.  However the black queen is also on the 4th row at d4.
1136,30,18,Rxf3,b'r5k1/pbp1b1p1/1p2p3/4P3/2pq2Pp/P1N2r1P/1PQ1B2K/R7 w - -',So I decide to move my rook to f3 and this means that the black rook will have to come down to the 3rd row to capture my rook.  The f3 square is protected by my LB at e2.

Now black queen captures my LB at f3 checking me again.  I think I must have forgotten that the LB is way up at b7 and now the queen is protected by this piece. 
1139,30,21,Qg3#,b'r5k1/pbp1b1p1/1p2p3/4P3/2p3Pp/P1N3qP/1PQ4K/R7 w - -',This is where I did not foresee the use of the pawn at h4.  As if I had moved my king to g1 on the last move then my queen would have been able to defend and there is the rook at a1.  So black queen moved to g3 and its checkmate.

Common ones include: c4 e5 Nf3 and g3 among the most popular (not in any particular order). The move 3. e3 opens the LSB line while leaving the option for d4 keeping the opponent guessing.

1198,33,7,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black's DSB is forced to protect the pawn. 
1199,33,8,f4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq f3',White continues the central pressure adding another attacker to the e5 assault.
1200,33,9,Qe7,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black adds the queen to the defense. One might wonder why not f6? If black 5... f6 first the black flank is open to a quick 6. Qh5+. This move is easily countered by g6 however the kingside pawn damage is done inhibiting a successful castle.
1201,33,10,Nf3,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White brings in more pressure to the e5. The flank attack is building now applying significant central pressure. However white now has now limited his queen's scope a bit.
1202,33,11,f6,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nb1p2/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Now white can now add the f6 pawn defender without fear of the Qh5+ threat.
1203,33,12,Nc3,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nb1p2/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White brings his other knight into play. While this reduces the scope of the DSB it is a natural development move. This sometimes provides white the possibility of a discovered attack on the black king side rook although that does not occur in this game.
1204,33,13,Be6,b'r3k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nbbp2/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black develops the LSB defending the d5 pawn.

1210,33,19,1dxe4,b'r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B2p3/4p3/1PN2N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black counterattacks and threatens the knight. Black might have alternatively moved d4 threatening the other knight. However this results in the black king side weakening further when white moves Nd5 and attacks the queen. I'm not sure which is the better move. I would personally not have created the isolated pawn but that's probably my personal fear at work. The isolated pawn will require constant defense attention from this point until its off the board. 
1211,33,20,1Nxe4,b'r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B2p3/4N3/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White takes the knight. This is one of the beautiful things about the fianchetto'd bishop. Now with one move white has created two separate threats on the black DSB and the e5 pawn. However this move has created two weak points as well. The white LSB and the knight at e4 are both undefended.
1212,33,21,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B2p3/4N3/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black castles bringing a rook to the semi-open e file.
1213,33,22,1Bxc6,b'r4rk1/ppp1q1pp/2Bbb2n/4p3/4N3/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White picks off one of the e5 pawn defenders.

1215,33,24,1Qe2,b'r4rk1/p1p1q1pp/2pbb2n/4p3/4N3/1P3N2/PBPPQ1PP/R4RK1 b - -',White connects the rooks and brings the queen into the game.

1217,33,26,1Qc4+,b'r4rk1/p1p1q1pp/2pb3n/4p3/2Q1N1b1/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',White recognizes the advantage and check attacks the c6 pawn relieving the knight pin and gaining a tempo.
1218,33,27,1Kh8,b'r4r1k/p1p1q1pp/2pb3n/4p3/2Q1N1b1/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black corners the king. If black moves Be6 instead this forces white to do exactly what he want to do take the pawn at c6. Moving the king and keeping the pressure on the knight forces white to address the knight first.
1219,33,28,1Nfg5,b'r4r1k/p1p1q1pp/2pb3n/4p1N1/2Q1N1b1/1P6/PBPP2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Which he does. Now white's knight is currently uncontested on the 5th row. This removes the threat at f3 and further pressuring the black king side.
1220,33,29,1Bd7,b'r4r1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb3n/4p1N1/2Q1N3/1P6/PBPP2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black brings the bishop back to guard the c6 pawn. The defensive energy required to take care of these pawns is a large factor in the game's outcome. Black has two bishops entirely engaged in guarding three pawns while white's sole bishop is fundamentally offensive. 
1221,33,30,1Rae1,b'r4r1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb3n/4p1N1/2Q1N3/1P6/PBPP2PP/4RRK1 b - -',White brings the rook to the e file to threaten the queen.
1222,33,31,1Nf5,b'r4r1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb4/4pnN1/2Q1N3/1P6/PBPP2PP/4RRK1 w - -',I didn't really understand this move. I would have expected Rae8 instead. I think black wanted to bring his knight into the game and eventually move h6 to kick the knight.
1223,33,32,1Nf3,b'r4r1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb4/4pn2/2Q1N3/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/4RRK1 b - -',Anticipating the kick white brings the knight back and continues the e5 pressure.
1224,33,33,1Rae8,b'4rr1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb4/4pn2/2Q1N3/1P3N2/PBPP2PP/4RRK1 w - -',Black brings the rook into play now. The action is on the e file now.
1225,33,34,1Nf2,b'4rr1k/p1pbq1pp/2pb4/4pn2/2Q5/1P3N2/PBPP1NPP/4RRK1 b - -',White brings the knight back applying indirect pressure to the black queen.
1226,33,35,1Be6,b'4rr1k/p1p1q1pp/2pbb3/4pn2/2Q5/1P3N2/PBPP1NPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black brings the LSB into play threatening the queen. This insulates the black queen a bit but again allows white to capture the c6 pawn.
1227,33,36,1Qxc6,b'4rr1k/p1p1q1pp/2Qbb3/4pn2/8/1P3N2/PBPP1NPP/4RRK1 b - -',Capture.
1228,33,37,1Nd4,b'4rr1k/p1p1q1pp/2Qbb3/4p3/3n4/1P3N2/PBPP1NPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black brings the knight around to threaten the queen forcing an exchange. I believe the black thought may have been to remove the strong DSB and activate the black bishop pair.
1229,33,38,2Bxd4,b'4rr1k/p1p1q1pp/2Qbb3/4p3/3B4/1P3N2/P1PP1NPP/4RRK1 b - -',Capture

1232,33,41,2Bd7,b'4rr1k/p1pbq1pp/2Qb4/8/3pN3/1P3N2/P1PP2PP/4RRK1 w - -',Black threatens the queen.

1277,35,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I reply with my usual. The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4. 
1278,35,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"He plays a dangerous sideline. If black is not careful white builds up an overwhelming king side attack.
2.f4 is the Grand Prix Attack or McDonnell Attack: the latter name stems from the 14th match game played in London in 1834 between Alexander McDonnell and Charles Louis Mahé de La Bourdonnais won by Black. According to Jeremy Silman and others Black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6! the Tal Gambit which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. White may decline the gambit with 3.Nc3 called the ""Toilet Variation"" so named after its reputed place of invention. A less common option is 2...e6 as La Bourdonnais played against McDonnell. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack nowadays by playing 2.Nc3 first before continuing 3.f4. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. Here White can play the positional 5.Bb5 threatening to double Black's pawns with Bxc6 or the more aggressive 5.Bc4 aiming for a kingside attack."

1295,35,19,1Ng4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/2p5/2PP1Pn1/4BN2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',The position is open so it is better to have bishops than knights.

1299,35,23,1cxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/8/2Pp1P2/4QN2/PP4PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Preparing either a nasty check on a5 with my queen or b4 with my bishop.
1300,35,24,1Qxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/8/2PQ1P2/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',My computer suggests that white should have delayed recapturing with Qd2 rather than allow the checks. Now black has a choice of tasty checks. Which one would you chose and why?
1301,35,25,1Qa5+,b'r1b1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/q7/2PQ1P2/5N2/PP4PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I thought this was the stronger check although my computer prefers Bb4.

I did look at 14.....Bd7 now (the move my computer recommends) but I didn't like the look of lines like 15. Rd1 0-0-0 16. Ne5. I also wanted to develop my Bf8 with tempo but didn't want my g7 pawn falling. Eventually I decided on a move which prepares Bc5 and also stops his knight from coming in to e5.

1305,35,29,1Bd7,b'r3kb1r/1p1b2pp/p3pp2/q7/2PQ1P2/5NP1/PP2K2P/R4B1R w kq -',I develop. Computer prefers Bc5.
1306,35,30,1Bg2,b'r3kb1r/1p1b2pp/p3pp2/q7/2PQ1P2/5NP1/PP2K1BP/R6R b kq -',Computer eventually plays this after considering 16. Bh3 although I was looking at this and thinking black had after Qh5 17. Bg2 Bc6 and I was really liking black's position.
1307,35,31,1Bc6,b'r3kb1r/1p4pp/p1b1pp2/q7/2PQ1P2/5NP1/PP2K1BP/R6R w kq -',Neutralizing the bishop. Computer still prefers Bc5.
1308,35,32,1Qd2,b'r3kb1r/1p4pp/p1b1pp2/q7/2P2P2/5NP1/PP1QK1BP/R6R b kq -',Computer prefers 17. Qe3. I was looking at this and thinking that if so I could just play Kf7 (computer prefers Bd7). I was thinking after 18. Nd4 Bxg2 19. Qxe6+ I could escape the checks by marching my king to h6. However after Kg6 20 Qg4 Kh6?? white has Nf5+! winning the black queen. So in this variation it seems best is just to allow the perpetual check. 
1309,35,33,1Bb4,b'r3k2r/1p4pp/p1b1pp2/q7/1bP2P2/5NP1/PP1QK1BP/R6R w kq -',I develop my bishop with tempo. Computer prefers exchanging queens but it is surely better to keep the queens on with his king still stuck in the middle.
1310,35,34,1Qe3,b'r3k2r/1p4pp/p1b1pp2/q7/1bP2P2/4QNP1/PP2K1BP/R6R b kq -',He attacks my pawn on e6.
1311,35,35,1O-O,b'r4rk1/1p4pp/p1b1pp2/q7/1bP2P2/4QNP1/PP2K1BP/R6R w - -',And I just calmly castle. Computer prefers 0-0-0 but surely my king is safer here.

1315,35,39,2Qb6,b'r4rk1/1p4pp/pqb1pp2/2b5/2P2P2/P4NP1/1P1QK1BP/R6R w - -',I of course refuse. Computer prefers exchanging still.
1316,35,40,2b4,b'r4rk1/1p4pp/pqb1pp2/2b5/1PP2P2/P4NP1/3QK1BP/R6R b - b3',He hits my bishop.
1317,35,41,2Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb1pp2/2b5/1PP2P2/P4NP1/3QK1BP/R6R w - -',I attack his queen with gain of time. Computer prefers Rf-d8 although it is surely better to move the a rook keeping the other rook for the f or e file.

1319,35,43,2Bd4,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb1pp2/8/1PPb1P2/P4NP1/4K1BP/R1Q4R w - -',and I attack his rook.
1320,35,44,2Ra2,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb1pp2/8/1PPb1P2/P4NP1/R3K1BP/2Q4R b - -',The rook moves.

1322,35,46,2Rd1,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/4p3/1PPb1P2/P4NP1/R3K1BP/2QR4 b - -',He foolishly ignores my threat. I thought at the time f4-f5 was the best move for him trying to keep the king side closed. Computer likes 24. fxe5 but I like my position after I recapture on e5 with the pawn as I also have the open f file.
1323,35,47,2exf4,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/8/1PPb1p2/P4NP1/R3K1BP/2QR4 w - -',I open the e file. I think this is best although computer likes Ba4.
1324,35,48,2Qxf4,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/8/1PPb1Q2/P4NP1/R3K1BP/3R4 b - -',White recaptures.
1325,35,49,2Be3,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/8/1PP2Q2/P3bNP1/R3K1BP/3R4 w - -',I like this move although computer prefers the straightforward Rf-e8+
1326,35,50,2Qg4,b'3r1rk1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/8/1PP3Q1/P3bNP1/R3K1BP/3R4 b - -',Computer actually prefers giving up the queen for two rooks with 26. Rxd8 - black is clearly winning now.
1327,35,51,2Rfe8,b'3rr1k1/1p4pp/pqb2p2/8/1PP3Q1/P3bNP1/R3K1BP/3R4 w - -',Black as several horrible threats.

1334,36,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This was a game with not a lot of pieces from the beginning.
1335,36,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I began with c4 and black responded with e5.
1336,36,2,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I then went with g3 to allow my bishop to fianchetto and black developed his bishop to c5.

1338,36,4,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/2b1p3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I now develop my b knight to c3 and black moves pawn to c6.

1348,36,14,Bxe3,b'rn1qk2r/p4pp1/1ppp1n2/7p/2P4P/1Q2b1P1/PP2NPB1/R4RK1 w kq -',I bring my DB to e3 attacking black's DB as he cannot evade capture so he will probably exchange and I can retake with my queen.
1349,36,15,Qe7,b'rn2k2r/p3qpp1/1ppp1n2/7p/2P4P/4Q1P1/PP2NPB1/R4RK1 w kq -',I take the DB with my queen and black brings his queen in front of his King as my queen was checking the king when I took the DB.
1350,36,16,g6,b'rn2k2r/p3qp2/1ppp1np1/6Qp/2P4P/6P1/PP2NPB1/R4RK1 w kq -',I do not wish to exchange queens right now as neither of us have a lot of pieces.  Black has a pair of knights and I have one of each.  So I move my queen to g5 and black pushes his pawn to g6.
1351,36,17,Ne4,b'rn2k2r/p3qp2/1ppp2p1/6Qp/2P1n2P/6P1/PP2NPB1/R3R1K1 w kq -',I move my rook f1 to e1 opposite the king but behind my e2 knight and black moves his knight to e4.

1353,36,19,Rf8,b'rn2kr2/p3q3/1ppp2p1/5p1p/2PQn2P/6P1/PP2NPB1/R3R1K1 w q -',I bring my queen to d4 attacking black's h8 rook.  Black moves h8 rook to f8.
1354,36,20,Qf6,b'rn2kr2/p7/1ppp1qp1/5p1p/2PQnN1P/6P1/PP3PB1/R3R1K1 w q -',I move my e2 knight to f4 and black moves the queen out of the pin to f6.  However black's e4 knight is still pinned to the king by the rook at e1.
1355,36,21,Qxd4,b'rn2kr2/p7/1ppp2p1/5p1p/2PqBN1P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w q -',I am not proud of my next move as I seem to have forgotten I have a pin and I decide to take the e4 knight with my LB and allow black's queen to capture my queen at d4.  The problem was that with black's queen at f6 and 3 pawns on the 6 row at b6 c6 and d6 it was difficult to find another move and I must have missed! the queen capture.  Of course my best move may have been to exchange queens at least I would have been in a better position than I am.  Also black has a pawn at f5 which can recapture my LB.  A bit of a mess I would say.
1356,36,22,Kd8,b'rn1k1r2/p7/1pBp2p1/5p1p/2Pq1N1P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I was able to move my LB away to c6 and check the king so my LB was safe for now although I don't know why black didn't capture my LB with his undeveloped b8 knight.  Black's king moves out of check to d8.
1357,36,23,Kc8,b'rnk2r2/p7/1pBpN1p1/5p1p/2Pq3P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',So I am able to recheck the king at e6 with my F knight.  This move also forks the queen.  King moves out of check again.
1358,36,24,Nxc6,b'r1k2r2/p7/1pnp2p1/5p1p/2PN3P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I now capture the queen at d4 with my E knight and black captures my LB with his B knight.  Black is attacking my knight at d4 with his c6 knight.
1359,36,25,Kc7,b'r4r2/p1k5/1pNp2p1/5p1p/2P4P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I capture black's d6 knight and king moves to c7 attacking my c6 knight.
1360,36,26,a6,b'r4r2/2k5/pp1p2p1/5p1p/2PN3P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',We are now in the end game and I have an extra piece a knight otherwise all even.  I move my knight out of the king's grasp to d4 and black brings his pawn out to a6.
1361,36,27,Kc6,b'r4r2/8/ppkpN1p1/5p1p/2P4P/6P1/PP3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I move my knight back up e6 checking the king who moves to c6.
1362,36,28,Rf6,b'r7/8/ppkpNrp1/5p1p/2P4P/6P1/PP3P2/2R1R1K1 w - -',I move my A rook across to c1 opposite the king and protecting my pawn at c4.  Black brings his F rook to f6 attacking my knight at e6 but this is protected by my e1 rook.
1363,36,29,b5,b'r7/8/p1kpNrp1/1p3p1p/2P2P1P/6P1/PP6/2R1R1K1 w - -',I push my f2 pawn to f4 stopping the black pawn's progress on the f file.  Black pushes his pawn to b5 attacking my pawn at c4.
1364,36,30,Kc5,b'r7/8/p2p1rp1/1pk2p1p/2PN1P1P/6P1/PP6/2R1R1K1 w - -',I check the king with my knight at d4 which moves to c5.  The king could capture my knight as it is not protected.
1365,36,31,Re8,b'4r3/8/p2p1rp1/1pk2p1p/2PN1P1P/6P1/PP6/2RR2K1 w - -',So I bring my e1 rook across to d1 to protect my knight.  Black now brings his a8 rook to e8 and takes control of the open file.
1366,36,32,Kb6,b'4r3/8/pk1p1rp1/1p3p1p/1PPN1P1P/6P1/P7/2RR2K1 w - -',I push my b2 pawn to b4 checking the king who moves over to b6.

1368,36,34,Ka5,b'4r3/8/p4rp1/kpP2p1p/3N1P1P/6P1/P7/2RR2K1 w - -',I recapture with b4 pawn and check the king again who now moves to a5.  My c5 pawn is now has a clear path to queen and is protected by my rook at c1.  However there are 2 rooks at f6 and e8 which could capture this pawn.
1369,36,35,Re3,b'8/8/p4rp1/kpP2p1p/3N1P1P/4r1P1/P6K/2RR4 w - -',I move my king over to h2 to avoid black's rook coming down to check it but if it were to land on e2 and check the king it would be captured by my knight at d4 so instead the rook comes down to e3.
1370,36,36,Rf8,b'5r2/8/p1P3p1/kp3p1p/3N1P1P/4r1P1/P6K/2RR4 w - -',I continue to try to push my pawn up to c6 and black moves his f6 rook to f8.
1371,36,37,Rc8,b'2r5/8/p1P3p1/kpR2p1p/3N1P1P/4r1P1/P6K/3R4 w - -',I move my C rook to c5 it allows me to move onto another file if I want to as my rook at d1 was restricting the rook's movement.  Black moves his f8 rook over to c8 stopping my queening intentions.
1372,36,38,Kb4,b'2r5/8/p1P3p1/1pR2p1p/1k3P1P/1N2r1P1/P6K/3R4 w - -',I recheck the king with my knight at b3 and the king moves out of check to b4.  The knight is protected by my a2 pawn and my c5 rook is protected by my knight.
1373,36,39,Rxe5,b'2r5/8/p1P3p1/1p2rp1p/1k3P1P/1N4P1/P6K/3R4 w - -',I decide to exchange the e3 rook and my c5 rook.  I move my c rook across to e5 and black captures with his e3 rook.  However the e5 square is protected by my pawn at f4.
1374,36,40,Rxc6,b'8/8/p1r3p1/1p2Pp1p/1k5P/1N4P1/P6K/3R4 w - -',I capture the rook at e5 with my pawn and black captures my passed pawn at c6.

But this is an inaccuracy because 1.e4 often leads to open positions as I also learned from Joe.  Therefore a bishop is worth more so if Sue accepts Steve could win in the long run find himself in trouble.

Now that coordination brings you a step closer to controlling the center as I've learned from GM Judit Polgar.

The idea being is that 23...Rg6 threatens mate and from there it's not easy to drive off.  The best move would be 24.Rf2 but even so white would still be faced with some difficult decisions.
1482,39,38,2Qd3,b'5r2/1N1pk1pp/r7/ppp3q1/Pn2Pp2/2BQ1P2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',?? I'm not sure why white played this but this is a blunder Sue because of what's about to unfold.  Much better was 23.Qe2 which solves the difficulty if black were then to play 23...Rg6.

After all it can't be captured.  Then with white's Rf1 being forced to retreat 29...Rxf3! becomes possible with both Rooks and the passed pawn against his King Steve would've had a forced win from there.  But by playing this Sue has compensated as she remains a piece up.

By moving it her a4 becomes dangerous especially since it's behind a Rook.  This is where the saying ""A rook behind passed pawn applies.""  You'll note that I'm not abandoning chess terms or bag of chess quotes but the idea is blending them right in with the overall picture as it's part of figuring out the entire story that the board is revealing since passers are very dangerous as they're what you use to promote."
1488,39,44,2Rh4,b'8/1N1pk1pp/8/2p3r1/Pp2P2r/3P1Pp1/1P5P/R4RK1 w - -',Renewing that threat.

1490,39,46,3Rxh2,b'8/1N1pk1pp/8/P1p3r1/1p2P3/3P1Pp1/1P5r/R4RK1 w - -',With that being said best was 30...gxh2+! after which white winds up in trouble.

But this is a blunder as black will be able to promote starting with the next move since Steve's g2 was very dangerous and had to be watched.  However it's not lost yet and with best play Sue should still win this game.
1494,39,50,3Rxe1,b'8/1N1pk1pp/P7/2p3r1/1p2P3/3P1P2/1P3Kp1/4R3 b - -',While not right away and although difficult black is still going to promote.

That passed pawn would be even more dangerous then what's on a6.
1499,39,55,3g5,b'8/1N1pk3/P7/2p2Ppp/1p2P1r1/3P4/1P3Kp1/4R3 w - g6',Trying to get a third set of passed pawns from black.  But Steve overlooked that white can capture here.
1500,39,56,3a7,b'8/PN1pk3/8/2p2Ppp/1p2P1r1/3P4/1P3Kp1/4R3 b - -',I know that you're really determined to promote but best was to hold off and take with 37.fxg6 e.p.  Yes an en-pessant capture could've been made since he's moved two square.
1501,39,57,3h4,b'8/PN1pk3/8/2p2Pp1/1p2P1rp/3P4/1P3Kp1/4R3 w - -',Meanwhile as noted before black is starting his dangerous pawn chain which will become a reality on his next move.

1504,39,60,4Qe7,b'8/3pQ3/3N1Pk1/2p3p1/1p2P1r1/3P3p/1P3Kp1/4R3 b - -',?? This however is the losing blunder.  Up until now white had the intitative.  But by playing this and with his Rg4 g and h pawns Steve's attacks against Sue is overwhelming.  Best was 42.f7 as Sue would promote due to her Nd6 and then if 42...h2 (which is happening) white would win after 43.f8=Q because if 43...h1=Q white answers with 44.Qf7# which is mate.  Even if he did stop mate for the time being white still forces a win.  but by playing this he is going to promote one way or another with what I noted earlier.  After that it's mate soon after. 
1505,39,61,4h2,b'8/3pQ3/3N1Pk1/2p3p1/1p2P1r1/3P4/1P3Kpp/4R3 w - -',Therefore it starts with this move.
1506,39,62,4f7,b'8/3pQP2/3N2k1/2p3p1/1p2P1r1/3P4/1P3Kpp/4R3 b - -',This was best a move earlier.  But now what was good a move prior doesn't work anymore.  It's worth noting that chess is like that but especially in close games like this.  The same thing happened when I played against Brendan except that it was the other way around.  So there was no room for errors as otherwise I'd lose.  Therefore there was only one way to win.  But I found the move.  I mention that because this is a similar position.
1507,39,63,4f8=Q,b'5Q2/3pQ3/3N2k1/2p3p1/1p2P1r1/3P4/1P3K2/7q b - -',It's unusual to see three Queen's on the board but not impossible.  However it's mate and black has that sequence.
1508,39,64,Qf2#,b'5Q2/3pQ3/3N2k1/2p3p1/1p2P3/3P1K2/1P3qr1/8 w - -',So both sides made blunders.  But the overall moral to this story is something that Jack Stockel emphasized to me which I then noted.  In the endgame you need to be more careful then other phases of the game.  That's because in the opening and mid games you can usually wiz your way out of a mistake.  But in the end there's usually no way out.  So one mistake there will often determine the final outcome.
