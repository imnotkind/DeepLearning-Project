102,3,11,1Nb3,b'r1b1k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n1B1/4P3/1NNB4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',"That's probably because if I had then attacked his Q he would simply win material or threaten mate.  But I do not remember the exact reason.  In addition I also forgot how he would do this.  I actually wanted to protect with 11.b3?? but that loses a Knight.  In the game I was a little pessimistic due to distractions as mentioned in the Intro.  So I told him that I had no choice but to a lose a pawn or piece.  Then he asked ""What's wrong with this move?""  I looked at the board and I said nothing.  In other words I figured out that this is best as it protects all of the above."
103,3,12,1Bg4,b'r3k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n1B1/4P1b1/1NNB4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',In the meantime he decides to reattack my Q.
104,3,13,1Qd2,b'r3k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n1B1/4P1b1/1NNB4/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',But that is not a problem this time.
105,3,14,1Be6,b'r3k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1pbnp1/4n1B1/4P3/1NNB4/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',But he also retreats a piece.  That's because my opponent knows that if he leaves his B out anylonger I will eventually win it after 13.f3.
106,3,15,1Rae1,b'r3k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1pbnp1/4n1B1/4P3/1NNB4/PPPQ1PPP/4RRK1 b kq -',Therefore I decide to play this move as it brings my Rooks together.  Note: It's not necessary but this is generally what you want to do.  BTW this is what GM Judit also did in her game.
107,3,16,1Bxb3,b'r3k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n1B1/4P3/1bNB4/PPPQ1PPP/4RRK1 w kq -',In the meantime he decides to take my N but that does not bother as I will simply recapture.  Therefore it will just become an even exchange.
108,3,17,Rc8,b'2r1k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n1B1/4P3/1PNB4/1PPQ1PPP/4RRK1 w k -',At this point he decides to move his a Rook here.  Why?  It puts pressure on the c file.
109,3,18,1Be3,b'2r1k2r/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/4n3/4P3/1PNBB3/1PPQ1PPP/4RRK1 b k -',"In the meantime I bring my DSB back to attack his Q and strengthen my bishop pair.  I believe that if he can put pressure on my c file I can put pressure on Glenda.  In other words ""Two can play that game"" as they say."
110,3,19,1Qc7,b'2r1k2r/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/4n3/4P3/1PNBB3/1PPQ1PPP/4RRK1 w k -',But Mr. Stockel will have none of that.  Instead he will increase the pressure.
111,3,20,1Bd4,b'2r1k2r/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/4n3/3BP3/1PNB4/1PPQ1PPP/4RRK1 b k -',That however is not a problem because I strengthen my bishop pair even more.
112,3,21,1Nxd3,b'2r1k2r/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3BP3/1PNn4/1PPQ1PPP/4RRK1 w k -',So he does not waste time to take my LSB.
113,3,22,1Qxd3,b'2r1k2r/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3BP3/1PNQ4/1PP2PPP/4RRK1 b k -',Now I had the option of taking back with my c pawn or Q.  I was originally going however to capture with the pawn.  Mr. Stockel said that it is not a great idea.  Why?  Taking with the pawn loses coordination and a pawn due to my doubled pawns.  He said that with doubled pawns coordination and details are even more important which is why you usually want to avoid doubling your pawns.  For me I don't necessarily agree with this because if I took back with the pawn I could probably win more material.  In this case I actually agree with cdeburca that there is more to chess then just doubled pawns.  But with Jack I can only go by what he lays out since this opponent is my coach.
114,3,23,1O-O,b'2r2rk1/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3BP3/1PNQ4/1PP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',"After my last move he castles Kingside.  Now no one is ahead or behind in development because both sides are completely developed.  After this move the game is paused for about an hour as Tom the other member shows the game while we analyze it.  And what he teaches is very important.  He played an interesting game and his opponent does not develop properly.  In fact he brings out his Queen by something like move 4 or 5 before most of his other pieces are developed.   He also blows away his chance to castle until it's too late.  In fact he gives away a piece by castling Queenside.  Why?  This opponent knows the player so he wants to throw Tom off guard.  But that plan backfires.  However the game is nowhere near over.  Tom makes a mistake that could have ended the game in a draw as opposed to a win.  Because he underestimates his opponent.  Ok remember when I showed everyone my game against amnita and that I lost a winning positon by underestimating her?  The same thing could have happened here.  As it turns out that moral of being careful in a winning position is derived from the facts.  Those facts are based on what Jack Stockel and GM Judith Polgar have said.  That is ""It's not so easy"".  Positions are a lot harder then they look and you must be cautious because if you don't handle things carefully you can lose even if you have winning advantage."
115,3,24,1Rec1,b'2r2rk1/1pq1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3BP3/1PNQ4/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',When the game resumes my goal is to take pressure off of the c file.  This move does that.
116,3,25,1Qb6,b'2r2rk1/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/8/3BP3/1PNQ4/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Because Jack is distracted he decides to attack my B but I fail on multiple occasions to take it for the exact same reason.  In fact it is also a reason why Jack lost to Tom.  That's significant because in the past Mr. Stockel has not been able to finish a game against the other member since Tom has to leave a little early.  And they are usually left with an interesting position.  Not this time his coaching also distracted him from that game as well.  
117,3,26,1Nd5,b'2r2rk1/1p2ppbp/pq1p1np1/3N4/3BP3/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',So I am hoping for an exchange which will happen but best was actually 19.Bxb6 because of what I just mentioned.  That move might have won but it's difficult to say.  Here's the thing winning the Q does not=an automatic win.  In that it's another example of where you must be careful with overconfidence.
118,3,27,1Nxd5,b'2r2rk1/1p2ppbp/pq1p2p1/3n4/3BP3/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',And I am thinking about what to do next in order to avoid falling behind.  Why?  If 19.exd5 I am a piece down after 19...Bxd4 because if then 20.Qxd4 20...Qxd4.  That is something that I am not going to allow.  However the immediate 20.Bxb6 was still feasible.  Instead I play something that just might end the game in a draw 20.Bxg7.  We then exchange for the next two moves until everything is even.
119,3,28,e6,b'2r2r2/1p3pkp/pq1pp1p1/3Q4/4P3/1P6/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',After the exchanges he decides to attack my Q.
120,3,29,2Qd4+,b'2r2r2/1p3pkp/pq1pp1p1/8/3QP3/1P6/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',?? But that does not bother me because I just place him in check.  However I missed the fact that this is actually a horrible move that should have lost the Q.  This is what's meant when I say that we both overlooked important details.
121,3,30,2e5,b'2r2r2/1p3pkp/pq1p2p1/4p3/3QP3/1P6/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Instead he reattacks my Q.  Now I miss an opportunity to take it.  Instead I embed my Q with the e and d pawns.  In other words I respond with 23.Qd5 in order to put pressure on the d file.
122,3,31,Qc6,b'2r2r2/1p3pkp/p1qp2p1/3Qp3/4P3/1P6/1PP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',And white decides to attack my Q because Mr. Stockel wants to exchange.  I am determined to give that to him but not before I advance my c pawn.  Why?  To connect my c and b3 pawns.  
123,3,32,2cxd5,b'2r2r2/1p3pkp/p2p2p1/3Pp3/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',I also could have taken with my e pawn but I like this move better.  Why?  I played this in order to exchange one of our Rooks.  Since no one is ahead I can't go wrong by exchanging material.
124,3,33,Ra8,b'r7/1p3pkp/p2p2p1/3Pp3/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/2R3K1 w - -',If I were black I would have played 26...Rb8 as it defends at least one square.  With 27.Rc7 I will attack two squares and pin his f7 pawn in this position. 
125,3,34,b5,b'r7/2R2pkp/p2p2p1/1p1Pp3/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/6K1 w - b6',? So he advances his b pawn but that does not matter because his f7 pawn remains pinned.  In fact this move is a mistake.  Why?  He loses a pawn momentarily.
126,3,35,2Rc6,b'r7/5pkp/p1Rp2p1/1p1Pp3/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/6K1 b - -',It starts with this move.  Afterall he cannot defend d6 and a6 in this position.
127,3,36,2a5,b'r7/5pkp/2Rp2p1/pp1Pp3/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/6K1 w - -',So he chooses the a file.  This mean that his d pawn is gone on my next move.
128,3,37,a4,b'r7/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/p3P3/1P6/1P3PPP/6K1 w - -',In this position black is hoping to exchange.  This time however I will not accept it immediately but that will change shortly.  Here's the thing if 30.bxa4 30...Rxa4 and black has a passed pawn.  That is something that I am not going to allow because one passed pawn is often enough to win.  It almost falls into the same category as having an extra pawn or blundering away a pawn.  Therefore I decide to play 30.b4 to prevent this feasibility.
129,3,38,a3,b'r7/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/1P2P3/p7/1P3PPP/6K1 w - -',He however still wants to exchange.  Because I prevented the passed pawn I will now accept theexchange on a3 especially since I'm still ahead.  
130,3,39,3g3,b'8/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/1P2P3/r5P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',"At this point I was thinking and had at one point played 32.Rb5.  Why?  Because I wanted another pawn.  But this is where ""It's not so easy"".  There was a mate threat that I had missed until my coach said something.  He asked ""can you see the threat""?  At first I didn't see it but then I spotted and told him.  I said that if I captured you would get a back rank mate on a1.  So I told him that this is my only move and he said ""That's right."""
131,3,40,3Ra4,b'8/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/rP2P3/6P1/5P1P/6K1 w - -',Either way I know that I cannot defend b4 so everything will be even again.  Therefore I am going to bring my K out.  When I defend against mate like this I generally activate the King.
132,3,41,3f3,b'8/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/1r2P3/5PP1/6KP/8 b - -',After he takes I decide to connect my pawns in an attempt to promote.  Of course that's never going to happen but this is a very interesting position.
133,3,42,3Rb1,b'8/5pkp/3R2p1/1p1Pp3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 w - -',But he also intends to promote which is why I played this.  Note: Rooks generally protect pawns when it comes to promotions.  I learned that from this same opponent a few months ago.  I think this happened in December of 2011 but am not completely sure.
134,3,43,3Rb6,b'8/5pkp/1R4p1/1p1Pp3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 b - -',In addition I also learned that a R right on top of a P generally prevents a promotion.
135,3,44,3Kf8,b'5k2/5p1p/1R4p1/1p1Pp3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 w - -',I do not know why he played this.
136,3,45,3d6,b'5k2/5p1p/1R1P2p1/1p2p3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 b - -',But I am still determined to promote.
137,3,46,3Ke8,b'4k3/5p1p/1R1P2p1/1p2p3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 w - -',And he is just as determined to prevent that.
138,3,47,3Rb7,b'4k3/1R3p1p/3P2p1/1p2p3/4P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 b - -',At this point I still want to make a Q but in a very interesting way.  As chesskingdom64 once annotated a R on the seventh rank can be very powerful.  I now see why and I kept that in mind before moving here.  Unlike before when I play 37.d8+ it will no longer be feasible for black to respond with 38...exd7 because of this move.  Therefore he'll have to move his K very carefully to prevent a promotion.  Note: I also know that he will not allow a promotion so why do I play this?  Like my game against youthanasia where I actually played poorly I am trying to make my opponent think.  My main goal is to give him another run for his money.  I already did this in a different game and I am trying to make history repeat itself eventhough it's in a different way. 
139,3,48,3b4,b'4k3/1R3p1p/3P2p1/4p3/1p2P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 w - -',"In the meantime he still wants to promote but I will not allow that.  Instead I am going to place him in check as noted on 37.Rb7.  I also could check him with 38.Re7+ but I don't like that as well because there is not as much pressure on the K.  BTW before I played this I asked Jack if 38.d7+ or 38.Re7+ was better and he said ""it dosen't make a difference.""  In this position I am trying to put as much pressure on the K as possible.  That way he really has to exercise his mind.  Note: This is all for cognitive reasons because psychology plays an essential role in chess.  If he really feels the pressure I will certainly come out stronger in the end.  Afterall this is something that gives me optimisum in my games."
140,3,49,Kd8,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6p1/4p3/1p2P3/5PP1/6KP/1r6 w - -',In this position his only other option was 38...Ke7 but then I promote right after 39.Rb8.  So I basically achieved my goal of making him think real hard about the position.  Note: He did take some time to come up with this move.
141,3,50,3f4,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6p1/4p3/1p2PP2/6P1/6KP/1r6 b - -',If I can't promote I will simply force an exchange especially since I am not behind.
142,3,51,b3,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6p1/8/4PP2/1p6/6KP/1r6 w - -',He still wants a promotion.
143,3,52,4f5,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6p1/5P2/4P3/1p6/6KP/1r6 b - -',I on the other hand either want to promote or force another exchange.  As it turns out the exchange will occur momentarily.
144,3,53,4b2,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6p1/5P2/4P3/8/1p4KP/1r6 w - -',And he continues to aim for a Q.  That however is almost irrelevant because my R is on the same file to prevent that.  
145,3,54,4fxg6,b'3k4/1R1P1p1p/6P1/8/4P3/8/1p4KP/1r6 b - -',In the meantime I decide take advantage by forcing another exchange.
146,3,55,4e5,b'3k4/1R1P1p2/6p1/4P3/8/8/1p4KP/1r6 b - -',So my new goal is to connect two pawns.  Why?  If I am successful a promotion becomes inevitable.  Of course I will not achieve my goal because of his f7 pawn but let's say that pawn was not there.  What would happen?  Two pawns would be right next to each other and he would not be able to take any of the pawns as I would place him in check with Rb8+.  Then his only moves would be ...Kc7 or ...Ke7.  After which I just play d8=Q.
147,3,56,4Ke7,b'8/1R1Pkp2/6p1/4P3/8/8/1p4KP/1r6 w - -',Therefore he cannot not allow that so this move is his only alternative.  That's exactly what I mean when I talk about placing him other pressure.  Afterall white has placed a lot of restrictions on black.
148,3,57,4h4,b'8/1R1Pkp2/6p1/4P3/7P/8/1p4K1/1r6 b - h3',After he protects I want my K to become a little more active.  Afterall this is now an endgame and the K is a very powerful weapon during that phase.  As we will see momentarily however it also happens to be the best move in this position.
149,3,58,4Kd8,b'3k4/1R1P1p2/6p1/4P3/7P/8/1p4K1/1r6 w - -',According to my opponent this is his only option as I am about to explain.
150,3,59,4Kh2,b'3k4/1R1P1p2/6p1/4P3/7P/8/1p5K/1r6 b - -',This is why.  In this position I was thinking about and had originally played 45.Kf2??.  However Jack pointed out that it loses because of 45...Kh1.  After which there is nothing that white can do to prevent black from promoting.  In fact this is one way that this opponent tested me.  He asked me what the only move was for white and this is it.  He then pointed out why.  As it turns out any other move loses for white.  In addition blacks only option is 45...Ke7 so any other move also loses for black.  Therefore Mr. Stockel explained that Kh1 and Kg2 just repeat themselves.  And ...Ke7 followed by ...Kc8 also reiterates so it becomes a draw by repetition.  Overall there is a lot to learn from this game but the main moral is simple.  And it is based on what this coach explained to me while we were packing up and getting ready to leave.  So what was it?  As we know you generally have to take enough time and think about all of the moves and positions.  Well that is more important critical and essential in an endgame.  This is why a position is not as easy as it might appear.  You might think to yourself something like oh I have a winning edge because I am ahead.  But in reality you have to be careful or you could lose that advantage very quickly and even turn a win into a loss which would waist a good game for nothing.  During an endgame one mistake often makes the difference between a win and loss.  Later on Jack showed me a different endgame just before we left.  It also proved that you must be very cautious.  The game had ended in a draw but like this game any other move from white or black would have been a losing blunder.
151,4,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So they open with this Nf3. An unusual opening I don't encounter it very much around the people I play with often. I decide to respond with...
152,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',...because normally if they try to deter an e pawn advancement the d pawn is normally a much better option.
153,4,2,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/P7/5N2/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq a3',(?!) - But then here... see when opponents usually do this move or something similar they're deliberately trying to look foolish most of the time. e6 is really tempting me here. A lot of beginners open with 1 a4?! e5! 2. Ra3?? Bxa3! I really didn't expect a player on Gameknot to do this so I was left to think for quite a bit. Not knowing where the player wanted to take me with this opening I thought really hard about both Nc6 Nf3 or e6. I saw d4 or e3 coming if I did Nc6. e3 would at least allow me a6 to deter a possible attack on my king's diagonal but I didn't have much to say against d4 after Nc6. Nf6 seems to be mostly a developer as I can't do e5 yet though I really want to. e6 right now shuts in my light bishop a little prematurely. But that's when I saw c5 and wondered about an early attack on d4 being able to work well with Nc6.
154,4,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/P7/5N2/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',It looked like my best move but I wasn't happy doing it. As of only the second move I'm trying an opening I have absolutely no familiarity with. Ah the thrill of exploration! Of course being a person who likes to know EVERYTHING heh I was anything but comfortable by this point. On the brighter side I had plans in motion but all of it depended on what their next move would be...
155,4,4,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/P7/4PN2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',They probably want to threaten Bb5+ to exchange back pieces and opening O-O with tempo while making d4 all that much more stronger. a6 will be met with d4 and Nc6 likely with Bb5. I also saw that I could slow White down from moving the bishop by advancing my c pawn but I hated how open and underdeveloped I was at this point. On the bright side... their dark bishop also seems to have closed up significantly.
156,4,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/P7/4PN2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Yes... Nf6! Of course! Now my kingside isn't as grossly underdeveloped and Bg5 if it will even be a threat at this point won't be happening anytime soon. d4 can be met with e6 opening the DSB and I have more options against Bb5+. Now I'm left asking- if I were White in this game how would I respond?
157,4,6,Ne5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2ppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I considered Ne5 purely because it was an open spot for the knight. But I had to wonder if this was best for White. Yes the square is open but it seems to be asking for much. Qh5 is already deterred and the only good square for the LSB is b5. Plus that knight looks like a sitting duck. It pretty much only seems to be there to threaten both the d and f squares on the 7th rank.
158,4,7,Qd6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3q1n2/2ppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',It's either I attack with Qd6 or I defend with a6. If they want to do Nxf7 they're going to do it either way. And at least this way the queen is developed instead of being closed in if I have to send either knight or the bishop toward d7. And the bishop check didn't scare me too much here.
159,4,8,Bb5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',-but they do it anyway! Probably just so they can castle and slow me down a little but this could mean they lose a powerful knight. Of course if they don't want to finish the trade now I'm perfectly fine with that.
160,4,9,Nbd7,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It's either this or Bd7. Not Nfd7 as it is more developed. I want them to trade or move the knight.
161,4,10,d4,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P2P4/4P3/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',(!) - But they're more interested in increasing the gambit. I'm not overly worried at the moment but I'm really wishing for a bit more experience with this opening. How can I break this attack?
162,4,11,e6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/4P3/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In the end I decided that the queen-bishop team was slightly more favorable than a bishop chase. Was there a stronger move to be made here?
163,4,12,Nc3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',(?!) - Why are they developing? Or are they actually just trying to contest d5? (Or prevent Ne4? But why even bother?)
164,4,13,Be7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I tried. I couldn't find a problem with Nc3 and (e4 dxc5 Nxd7 Bxd7+ etc) all look like preventable moves at this point. If this is my chance to break the pins and castle I'll gladly take it now. At least that will undermine the pressure on my e file (after his O-O) and the pin on the d knight.
165,4,14,Qf3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Looks like White wants d5 after all. I can kinda see what they want out of the queen here. She's in a square where damage can be done on both the d5 and f7 pawns if I'm not careful about them. On the other hand cxd4 is starting to look really good now and I wonder what White plans to do if Black follows through with freeing the knight.
166,4,15,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',(!) - At last a position I'm comfortable with! Now my king is snug in the corner with lots of options. All my pins are gone the pressure on the e file is off and now it is White who cannot castle yet. If O-O then I could start a battle for the centre that I will win. White must first address the threat of me doing that before they can hide their king away just yet...

It gets worse too. Now the center is under heavy attack and I have strong threats against both the e and c pawns. Above all other moves White should not have done dxc5. (Well there are worse blunders to make right? :P)

Even if they retreat the bishop to d3 the knight is guarding the critical h square. The attack is easily guarded against; the WQ is mostly just helping the kingside pawns for the time being.

It doesn't matter if White decides to trade away the LSB; they are still forced to move the knight away (most likely to e2) and lose the pawn. And again- unless White is suicidal the king cannot escape to g1 yet. Thus concludes the opening.

So I went for my own tactics. I didn't see how I could survive Ng6 but I could play Qe4! Nxf8 Qxc4 and white's knight cannotr escape. Not seeing Qe4 I played a very dubious tactical shot
308,7,11,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qpp1/7p/4N3/1bB1nP2/2P5/P2QN1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',? This tactic doesn't work if he simply plays Qd4 then I am lost. He attacks my knight protects his c4 bishop and still threatens Ng6+ winning the exchange. I can't defend against all of these threats.

It was probably the most tactical game I had played on gameknot up to them and an enjoyable one moving straight from a dull looking opening to a very exciting battle.

429,11,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black immediately pulls me out of my opening repertoire with this move transposing from the English Opening to the English Defense...

431,11,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',That in mind I contest those squares. Also possible was 3.e4 but I was worried about creating an overadvanced undersupported pawn center.

436,11,8,Bxe4,b'rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/8/3Pb3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black gains his extra pawn.
437,11,9,Ne5,b'rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/4N3/3Pb3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The Knight holds a strong point in the center of the board threatening c6 and f7 as well as letting the WQ out to g4 should she choose that path later on.

This jab foreshadows things to come--White puts a Rook in danger in order to stab at a more valuable Black piece. The tactics and counterattacks only increase from here.

445,11,17,1f6,b'rn1qkb1r/p5pp/1pp1pp2/3bN3/3P4/P1PB1PP1/7P/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Since Black would rather not lose his only active piece he pushes the Knight back to make room for ...e6-e5. I'm pretty sure 13...c5 was playable here as well and perhaps preferable as it frees up c6 for a Knight but it does open the a4-e8 diagonal again so perhaps pushing the Knight off of e5 first was best after all.

I'd also considered playing 17.Bf5!? where 17...Bxf5 18.Nxf5 gives the White Knight a reasonably strong position but I was hoping to create a way to land on d6 first (to make 18...g6 less appealing).
452,11,24,b5,b'r3kb1r/p1qn2pp/2p1bp2/1p2p3/Q2PB3/P1P1NPP1/7P/R1B2RK1 w kq -',White pins the pawn to the Rook and threatens to win it so Black responds with a kick to the Queen which must now retreat to c2.

456,11,28,2exd4,b'r3kb1r/p1q3pp/1np1bp2/1p6/3pB3/P1P1NPP1/2Q4P/1RB2RK1 w kq -',So Black initiates an exchange to create a white isolani that he can perhaps win at a later date. The danger is that now the e-file is open with his King still right in the center.
457,11,29,Rc8,b'2r1kb1r/p1q3pp/1np1bp2/1p6/3PB3/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB2RK1 w k -',More to unpin the c-pawn than anything else. I think I would have preferred to castle here though.
458,11,30,2Bxh7,b'2r1kb1r/p1q3pB/1np1bp2/1p6/3P4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB2RK1 b k -',!? This move seems innocuous enough even strong. But like I said earlier letting the King Rook out of its cage is a whole bag of worms unto itself and this move will prove to have huge consequences for the rest of the game. For White: the g6 square is now available to play on with his Bishop Queen and/or Knight. For Black: a direct line to the White King has opened up to compliment the view his Queen already has.
459,11,31,2c5,b'2r1kb1r/p1q3pB/1n2bp2/1pp5/3P4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB2RK1 w k -',! The pawn advance is really an incidental part of this move: the point is that it challenges the d4 pawn and sets the stage for opening the c-file and placing the dark Bishop on c5.
460,11,32,2Re1,b'2r1kb1r/p1q3pB/1n2bp2/1pp5/3P4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 b k -',White ignores (perhaps unwisely) the threat to his isolated d-pawn and glares down at the Black King with a reminder: the e-file is open and you are a sitting duck! My plan at this point was to respond to 23...cxd4 with a check on g6 perhaps followed by a Queen trade or a Knight hop to d5/f5 depending on the situation. I can regain my pawn with Rxb5 whenever it's convenient.
461,11,33,2Kd7,b'2r2b1r/p1qk2pB/1n2bp2/1pp5/3P4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 w - -',? Still I think 23...cxd4 was best. This just seems to invite an attack. I fretted about my next move here for a solid week. Should I play 24.Bf5 to incite a trade in the center and get my Rook into the action? Should I simply advance with 24.d5 and push the Bishop out of the way first (Black can't reply with a capture e.g. 24...Nxd5? 25.Nxd5 Bxd5 26.Qf5+ and White is up a piece) or perhaps play 24.Rxb5 directly in preparation for cutting across the center? The possibilities are tremendous.
462,11,34,2Bf5,b'2r2b1r/p1qk2p1/1n2bp2/1pp2B2/3P4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 b - -',I eventually decide on this which I'm reasonably happy with. I was torn mostly between this move and 24.d5 and was unable to find a compelling reason to play the latter. I chose the move you see here because I was worried I'd overlook my Bishop up in the corner and lose it by moving my Queen carelessly (or getting it chased away).
463,11,35,2cxd4,b'2r2b1r/p1qk2p1/1n2bp2/1p3B2/3p4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 w - -',! I was really hoping for 24...Bxf5 25.Qxf5+ where White has a great attack. Unfortunately my opponent plays solid chess and did not give me an easy time of it. Still the GK computer gives White a solid lead here (but more on that in a moment for why I don't trust the GK engine at all...)
464,11,36,2Bxe6+,b'2r2b1r/p1qk2p1/1n2Bp2/1p6/3p4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 b - -',This is best I'm pretty sure. The Black King is drawn onto the e-file prime checking real estate. Here's a funny bit--just before this move the GK computer gives White an edge of about one and a half points. Once I take this Bishop--clearly a move it should have considered!--White's perceived advantage jumps to +4.15!
465,11,37,2Kxe6,b'2r2b1r/p1q3p1/1n2kp2/1p6/3p4/P3NPP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 w - -',This is essentially forced but I spent another very long time staring at this board. I'm glad I wasn't faced with this position in an over-the-board game! Once more there are a terrific number of possibilities. The main things to consider were: the discovered check from moving the Knight; the hanging WQ once the Knight moves; the fact that the Knight is hanging if it stays; the undefended Black pawn on b5; and the threat of a check or pin via ...Bc5. Plenty to think about while trying to calculate variations!
466,11,38,2Nf5+,b'2r2b1r/p1q3p1/1n2kp2/1p3N2/3p4/P4PP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 b - -',Unfortunately I chose a subpar move but I'm not too disappointed with myself. Fritz found this very deep and counterintuitive continuation to gain a big advantage for White: 26.Nd5+! Kxd5 27.Qe4+ Kc5 28.a4! (threatening Ba3+ with mate to follow) ...b4 29.Ba3! (Black cannot take lest he fall to Rb5+) ...a5 30.Rbc1+ Nc4 (forced or the BQ falls) 31.Qe6 (threatening Rxc4+ winning the Queen anyway) ...Qd6 32.Rxc4+ Kb6 33.Rxc8 where White has *finally* won some material and has a winning game.
467,11,39,2Kf7,b'2r2b1r/p1q2kp1/1n3p2/1p3N2/3p4/P4PP1/2Q4P/1RB1R1K1 w - -',This is absolutely Black's best move. The other options leave his King much too exposed.
468,11,40,2Qxc7+,b'2r2b1r/p1Q2kp1/1n3p2/1p3N2/3p4/P4PP1/7P/1RB1R1K1 b - -',White's undefended Queen has nothing better to do at this point.

White has more activity but Black has that powerful passed d-pawn for White to worry about. I considered playing 28.Nxd4 (Bc5 29.Be3) for a while but I decided on the text move as being more aggressive (and therefore more fun!)
470,11,42,2Rc2,b'5b1r/p4kp1/1n3p2/1R3N2/3p4/P4PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 w - -',! Nasty! Remember how I said the missing Black h-pawn would be important? Well here it is! White now has to weigh his attacking options against Black's. I concluded that I could always play Nh4 if anything nasty happened on the kingside so I proceeded with my attack...
471,11,43,2Ra5,b'5b1r/p4kp1/1n3p2/R4N2/3p4/P4PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 b - -',Quiet-looking threat upon quiet-looking threat. I hadn't calculated all the variations when I played this but Rxa7+ looked strong enough that I figured I could get away with it. I still think I was right though it also looks like I was right to have been afraid of 29...d3! As my opponent mentioned around this point: a good position for a tactics masterclass but too much for either of us!
472,11,44,2Bc5,b'7r/p4kp1/1n3p2/R1b2N2/3p4/P4PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 w - -',"!? The tactics are piling up. Both sides now have potent mating attacks prepared but who can pull his off first? Too close to call in my opinion. I choose the ""obvious"" line here in deference to my sanity but before you go on let me call your attention to the other line I was considering: 30.Rxc5?! Rxc5 31.Nxd4 where White has a Bishop and pawn against Black's pocket Rook."
473,11,45,3Rxa7+,b'7r/R4kp1/1n3p2/2b2N2/3p4/P4PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 b - -',Black technically has lots of ways to respond to this but only one doesn't end in mate.
474,11,46,3Nxg7,b'5k1r/R5N1/1n3p2/2b5/3p4/P4PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 b - -',?! Threatening Re8# but now the initiative is in Black's hands and the Knight has given up control of e3. There might yet be a win in this for White if I'd continued 31.h4 instead (cutting out the Rh8 from my kingside) but as it stands Black can now force a draw.
475,11,47,3d3+,b'5k1r/R5N1/1n3p2/2b5/8/P2p1PP1/2r4P/2B1R1K1 w - -',Black advances with check; White really has only one move.

However 5. ..b6 was not the best response.  5. ..cxd4 would have been much better.  I believe he was nervous.

Kd7 allows for fxe6+ and also opens space for the stacked rooks to pound through the created hole!

Personally nowadays I do not usually play 1. ... e5 as after 2.

The only correct move would've been 3. ... exd4 but after 4. c3 things get awkward.

Most juniors might think: ""How absurd for a grandmaster"" since after 2. ... cxd4 3. Qxd4 White gets an early queen that can be easily chased away with such things like 3. ... Nf6! etc. 

The reason is after 2. ... cxd4 White follows with 3. c3! and as I said things get in a muddle then. A national game went: 1. e4 c5 2. d4!? cxd4?! 3. c3! dxc3!? 4. Bc4 cxb2? 5. Bxb2 5 ... e5 6.

594,14,0,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Standard stuff so far. Now that both players have castled we can embark on complications.

613,14,19,2Qg7#,b'r2r1Bk1/pbp3Qp/1p4p1/8/8/3q4/P5PP/5R1K b - -',...a forced mate!
614,15,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The Reti generally is a quiet opening but soon this will turn into something completely different...
615,15,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',White transposes this into a symmetrical English.
616,15,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',This is already a step towards a somewhat more tactical game the centre will be opened soon. I like to play this variation against the English.
617,15,3,Qb3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',?! At the time I thought this should still be theory but in over 15 million games at 365chess.com this position has never occurred before. Quite a rarity after only 4 White moves. I guess the aim is to attack the centre immediately and prevent Black's bishop from developing on the c8-h3 diagonal.
618,15,4,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/2pn4/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Here Fritz (my computer program) prefers to play 5...Qxd5. I thought White could play 6.Qc2?? and then chase my queen with Nc3 or Bg2 but that fails to 6...Nd4! and if 7.Qd1? Qe4! the mate threat(!) on f3 and fork threat on c2 are just too much to handle for White (here we already see the game sharpening). So instead of 6.Qc2?? White has to retreat to d1 or exchange queens which results in a slightly better queenless middlegame for Black due to his extra space. Of course I missed this but my move is not bad.
619,15,5,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/2p5/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Black's knight was under pressure and I didn't like to block in my light-squared bishop with 6...e6.
620,15,6,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/2p3N1/8/1Q4P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',!? I had not expected this move. This is a flat-out mating threat on f7 like a scholar's mate. However I don't like it very much. This knight will have to waste time retreating later on.
621,15,7,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/6N1/2p5/1Q4P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Again not wanting to play 7...e6.
622,15,8,Qf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/6N1/2p5/5QP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',? This is just a bad move. Black will surely not fall for this after he has seen it last move. The queen will be chased away easily from here.
623,15,9,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2p5/5QP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',?! Very natural defending the mate and chasing the queen at the same time... But not quite best. After 8...f6 9.Ne4 Nd4 10.Qc3 e5 and ...f5 Black has an overwhelming centre.
624,15,10,Qc7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2p5/2Q3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',?! Again not a very good move. I was not willing to weaken my light-squared diagonals but 9...f6 defends my knight solidifies my centre and chases White's knight at the same time so that's the best move here.
625,15,11,1d4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq d3',! I had missed that I couldn't take en passant due to my hanging queen.
626,15,12,1O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/6N1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',I had rather expected (and feared) 11.d5! which is indeed a very strong move but White tucks his king away first.
627,15,13,1Bf5,b'r3kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',?! Developing but probably 11...f6 was still preferable.
628,15,14,1Nd2,b'r3kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',And here again 12.d5 could have been played.
629,15,15,1Rd8,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w k -',Unable to defend c4 I choose to counter-attack.

631,15,17,1Nxd4,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/5bN1/2pnP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B2RK1 w k -',! White can't take my bishop due to the royal fork on e2.
632,15,18,Bg6,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/6N1/2pnP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k -',Fritz prefers 14...Bg4 but I liked this diagonal to keep pressuring White's centre.
633,15,19,1b3,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/6N1/2pnP3/1PQ3P1/P2N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b k -',Attacking my strong pawn on c4. I'm still not able to take due to the undefended queens facing each other of course.
634,15,20,1Nb5,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/1n4N1/2p1P3/1PQ3P1/P2N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k -',Enabling ...cxb3 and stopping White from taking on c4 immediately but missing The possibility of a move repetition for White.
635,15,21,1Qb4,b'3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/1n4N1/1Qp1P3/1P4P1/P2N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b k -',?! White misses it too or didn't want it. After 16.Qa5 I have no better than retreating to d4 since 16...Qc5?? is strongly met by 17.a4!.
636,15,22,1Qe5,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/1n4b1/1n2q1N1/1Qp1P3/1P4P1/P2N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k -',? I see a possibility to win material and grab it. Unfortunately the position is far too sharp to go after a rook which is doing nothing on a1. 16...Nd4 is better. I'm threatening a family fork on c2 so 17.Qc3 is forced when I can play 17...Qe5. I think I missed that after 18.Qb2 the knight on g5 is hanging.
637,15,23,1Nxc4,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/1n4b1/1n2q1N1/1QN1P3/1P4P1/P4PBP/R1B1R1K1 b k -',! White finds the correct move in this razor-sharp position.
638,15,24,1Nxc4,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/6b1/1n2q1N1/1Qn1P3/1P4P1/P4PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k -',I thought White's knight was too dangerous to stay alive but I should have taken on a1. I feared 18.Nxb6?! axb6? 19.Qxb5+ but I missed 18...a6!. Fritz gives a long variation which results in a better endgame for Black: 19.Bf1 Qf6 20.Bxb5+ axb5 21.Qxb5+ Qc6 22.Qxc6+ bxc6 and I'm an exchange up. So instead of 18.Nxb6?! White should play 18.Qxb5+ when I can hold with 18...Nd7. Then White has lots of compensation for his exchange due to his activity but it's not clear whether it's enough.
639,15,25,Nd6,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/3n2b1/4q1N1/1QP1P3/6P1/P4PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k -',? Unfortunately this is the losing move. I should have played 18...Nd4. I didn't like the look of 19.Bf4 when I thought I had to play 19...Qf6 20.e5 Qa6 and White is just too active. But 19...Ne2+! is a nice counter. White can't take the knight as his rook on a1 would be hanging so I can exchange the dangerous bishop and win a pawn. Also not as good was 18...Nc3 because White still has a positional advantage due to his better coordinated pieces and Black's undeveloped kingside.
640,15,26,Qd4,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/3n2b1/6N1/1QPqPB2/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 w k -',Looks dangerous but it's the only move to at least stay in the game. 19...Qf6?? loses a piece to 20.e5.
641,15,27,2Bxd6,b'3rkb1r/pp2pppp/3B2b1/6N1/1QPqP3/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 b k -',Better was 20.Rad1! as 20...Qb6? fails to 21.Qa4+ Qc6 22.Qxc6+ bxc6 23.e5! and White wins a piece due to the threats on c6 but this is enough for the win too.
642,15,28,2Qd5,b'4kb1r/p2rpppp/3q2b1/3Q2N1/2P1P3/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 b k -',? This gives away a big part of White's advantage. Strong was 22.e5! because 22...Rxb7 23.exd6 is winning for White. Black must keep defending e7 but 23...Rd7 loses an exchange to 24.Bc6.
643,15,29,2Qf6,b'4kb1r/p2rpppp/5qb1/3Q2N1/2P1P3/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 w k -',?? However I miss my last chance to stay in the game. I should have defended the b5 square with 22...Qa6 or 22...Qb6. Here I can't really exchange queens because White's centre pawns would be far too strong but this is even worse.
644,15,30,2Qb5,b'4kb1r/p2rpppp/5qb1/1Q4N1/2P1P3/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 b k -',! I won't be able to defend my rook on d7 there are just too many pieces able to attack it.
645,15,31,e5,b'4kb1r/p2r1ppp/1q4b1/4p1N1/Q1P1P3/6P1/P4PBP/R3R1K1 w k e6',So I can reply to 25.Rad1 with 25...Bd6.
646,15,32,2Bh3,b'4kb1r/p2r1ppp/1q4b1/4p1N1/Q1P1P3/6PB/P4P1P/R3R1K1 b k -',But this bishop can also attack the rook. I can resign here.

Both sides made mistakes but White showed he was better in handling a very sharp position. I hope you enjoyed looking over this game it sure was a pleasure to play it even though it was my first loss to a lower rated player in a rated OTB game.

At my level I disagree that this was a mistake and I actually think that this was one of my pivotal moves.  The computer analysis shows that the best response to b6 is qb5+.  However that doesn't give white any obvious gain (Bd7 response) so few players at my level would choose that.

I like my move and would use it again because of the powerful threats against white's queen and knight (which I eventually took).  I thought that white would likely retreat and I would move pxc5.  Instead white fell for the bait.  That put me at -2 but I quickly responded by taking white's knight and pawn and pinning white's king and a1 rook for the entire rest of the game."

677,17,8,Nxb6,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/1n6/3pp3/8/1Nb1PP1P/r1P3P1/1RK2B1R w - -',I am not worried at all about what is going on on the left side of the board.  My knight is playing the crucial role of eliminating the threat of the advanced pawn in addition to dislodging either white's knight or b1 rook.
678,17,9,Nc4,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/8/3pp3/2n5/1NbBPP1P/r1P3P1/1RK4R w - -',If white takes my knight my pawn will then threaten his carefully placed knight.  That is why he leaves it alone while I go and attack his rook.

680,17,11,2Nd2,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/8/3pp3/4P3/n1bB1P1P/r1PN2P1/1RK4R b - -',The computer labels this a blunder by white and suggests that he should have moved Ra1; but I honestly think he doesn't have any good option at this point since Ra1 would give me an 8 point lead and an attacking position.
681,17,12,2Rd1,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/8/3pp3/4P3/2bB1P1P/2P3P1/rNKR4 b - -',White just blocked off his only escape route giving me mate in 2.  However the alternative (Kd1) would have given me a 13 point lead.  With those alternatives the best thing is probably just to hope your opponent makes a mistake.

918,25,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Ok it is not normal but I don't think that you can say that is unplayable. It just proposes a different than usual set on the board and this takes me out from my own beloved schemes. 
919,25,1,Bf4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',I go on as normal (for the London or at least my way to play it) controlling e5. 
920,25,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Brings in forces on e5. I kind don't like this move with d5 by black but I wasn't sure it was really stunning 3. d5. After Ne5 black's game looks weird and cramped but it is difficult to say if it is a real edge for white and how to exploit it. It was only a blitz...
921,25,3,e4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq e3',This can't be bad I though. Out of my scheme but due. 
922,25,4,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black is decided to play e5 even against common sense that suggest not to move f6 before castling. But 4. Qh5+ at once is ineffective: after 4. g6 black's pawns are weakened true but my queen has nothing best than to go backward losing a tempo. And black's 5... e5 will follow undisturbed. 
923,25,5,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',"With a piece hitting g6 - either knight or bishop - it is possible to use ""piece x g6"" tactics (being h7 pinned to the queen) to break in but the knight won't be the piece to do it in this position: the bishop is. OF course this is a silly line since black can play 4... e5 blocking the bishop's action. So this was a blunder of mine actually. I just though that black could be tempted to take in d4 giving me the necessary tempo to push e5.  "
924,25,6,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppbp1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',He didn't take the bite but he is not playing what he has prepared: all this moves's scope was to take control of e5 so why don't you play it now that you can? If you don't I'll do and this will be dangerous for you. Actually this move is awful since it blocks an escape rout for he king and closes the queen in a self trap not allowing the queenside castiling. 
925,25,7,e5,b'r2qkbnr/pppbp1pp/2np1p2/4P3/3P1B2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',So I went for it. I didn't care if he had taken it with either of his pawns: I'll go Qh5+ anyway. I was not sure it would have won but it looked like it. I had too many favours due to Bd7 not to get something in return if I attacked that way despite Bf4 was attacked by the pawn. Black could have tried g6 at once his only defence and white would have had to rethink the attack. But my opponen wanted to get things more complicated and counterattacked the bishop wihtout compromising his central pawns. true is that if white takes one of them e5 becomes playable again.. opening the black's king cage with a complex game (IMO).

1171,33,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He takes. For the first time in the game I had a think. I did consider taking with the queen threatening his rook on h8 but after 4. Qxd4 Nf6 5. e5 Nc6 I didn't think that white had any advantage. I check on the Opening Databases after the game seemed to back me up.
1172,33,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I took with the knight.

1188,33,22,1Neg4,b'r2qr1k1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/8/2PNPPn1/2N1B3/PP1QB1PP/2KR3R w - -',He hits my bishop.
1189,33,23,1Bg1,b'r2qr1k1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/8/2PNPPn1/2N5/PP1QB1PP/2KR2BR b - -',So I retreat planning to continue with h3 his knight retreats to h6 and then I play g4 threatening g5. What on earth can he do about it? I was thinking that he must now move his king Bd7 or Re8 to make a space foe a knight to retreat to and was trying to work out which move was best for him when he shattered my composure with....stop now and work out black's best move.

However it is an excellent move! Tactical considerations outway the strategic weaknesses it makes. One problem I have to watch for is a horrible pin on the c1-h6 diagonal for instance 14. fxe5? Bh6! wins white's queen. So I can't take on e5 and if next move he plays exf5 I can't take back with the queen for the same reason. I considered Nd4-b5 Nf3 and Nb3 but eventually came to the conclusion that the knight belonged on c2 so that after he takes on f4 his knight can't come to e3.
1191,33,25,exf4,b'r2qr1k1/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/8/2P1Ppn1/2N5/PPNQB1PP/2KR2BR w - -',So he takes.

I didn't think that I had any advantage but I didn't want to lose rating points and I thought it would be an educational experience for both of us to play on.
1202,33,36,2c5,b'r5k1/ppqb1p1p/4r1pb/2PQn3/4Pp2/8/PPN1B1PP/1K1R2BR b - -',I played this to free up my c4 square for my bishop but this may well have been a mistake.

I do not like that his minor pieces are still on the back rank. One problem though is that it allows black to do Be2! gaining the exchange or a bishop. 
1242,34,10,1Nbxd5,b'r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/3b1n2/1B1n3b/1P1P1p1N/2PQ3P/P5P1/RNB2RK1 w - -',However I was too focused on the pawn to see that move and gave away the initiative.

1347,38,5,1e4,b'3r1rk1/pp1nb2p/2p1b3/q4p2/2P1p3/1PNQ2NP/P1PB2P1/3R1R1K w - -',"And here it is. I looked at all the possible continuations for a day or so and finally was surprised to find an eight (8) move combination that involved the sacrifice of the knight and even a rook with check. 
It is because of these types of positions I love chess. The energy of the white position completely overcomes the material considerations.
The combination begins with 19. Ngxe4.

After the game the Gameknot analyzer said that this was an inaccuracy. Here is the Gameknot analyzer analysis at this point:

19. Ngxe4 Inaccuracy: -1.13 » 19. Ngxe4 fxe4 20. Qg3+ Kh8 21. Nxe4 Bb4 22. Bxb4 Qxb4 23. Ng5 Bf5 24. Rxd7 Rxd7 25. Qe5+ Kg8 26. Rxf5 Rxf5 27. Qxf5 Rd1+ 28. Kh2 

Best: -0.29 » 19. Ncxe4 fxe4 20. Qxd7 Rxd7 21. Bxa5 Rxd1 22. Rxd1 e3 23. Rd3 Bg5 24. h4 Bf4 25. Ne2 Bh6 26. Bc3 Rf1+ 27. Kh2

Funny huh? The gameknot analyzer thought that my continuation 19. Ngxe4 was a mistake and completely missed the subsequent 22.Nd5!"

21.... Bxf8  22. Nd5 Qxd2  23. Rxd2 cxd5  24.cxd5 Bf7  25. Qc7 Be7  26. d6 Bg5  27. Re2 Bg6  28. Qxb7 Nf6  29 Qe7 Re8  30. Qxa7

and there is very little doubt that white will overcome black with all of those pawns."

1350,38,8,3Qf6,b'4q2k/pp4np/2p2Q1N/6P1/2P1p3/1P2K3/P1P3P1/8 b - -',And now black is in sort of zugzwang. He cannot move his queen from the back rank the knight and king and the h-pawn can't move at all.  So the winning process is fairly simple create a passed pawn on the queen side and trade all of the material. 
1351,38,9,4a6,b'3Nn1k1/7p/P7/6P1/1P2p3/2p1K3/2P3P1/8 b - -',"Black resigns. This was a lot of fun.

Moving the knight in general to the edge of the board is not usually a good move but in this position it's not bad.

But I did not want the position opening up yet despite the fact that allowing it to stay closed is better for black right now.
1363,39,11,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnp1bp/2p3p1/3p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6',I don't like this black move. it leaves the black Kingside really open. I can't take advantage of that for a long while but I am not going to trade on e4 which is perhaps what black was hoping for.
1364,39,12,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/ppqnp1bp/2p3p1/3p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',This was not the best move but I am planning on moving the f pawn and want the king off of the a7-g1 diagonal. It's a long preparation for chasing the knight and black eventually gains an advantage because of it.
1365,39,13,1a5,b'r1b2rk1/1pqnp1bp/2p3p1/p2p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1R1K w - a6',Perhaps black is entertaining ideas of a queenside attack with this move.
1366,39,14,1Ng1,b'r1b2rk1/1pqnp1bp/2p3p1/p2p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RNK b - -',This move is too slow and black has a tiny push now on the queenside.

This allows me the tempo I needed to move the f pawn although black's idea is to really strangle the queenside here and it's not a bad plan.
1369,39,17,Nxc3,b'r1b2rk1/2q1p1bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3P4/1PnBPP2/PBP3PP/R2Q1RNK w - -',Practically forced for black to maintan his initiative on the queenside.

I don't like finally white's position here; black has a clear advantage to me. I decide to give up a pawn here depending on what black does and blunt his pawn advance.
1371,39,19,1e4,b'r1b2rk1/2q3bp/1np3p1/pp1ppp2/3PP3/1PBB1P2/P1P3PP/R2Q1RNK b - -',Some may consider this a blunder but I am thinking about the position; I'd rather have chances with a tactical opportunity by a more open board than be crushed by black's superior positioning to this point in this game. My opponent is ranked around the expert level or a bit higher; he's no slouch.
1372,39,20,1Bd2,b'r1b2rk1/2q3bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3pP3/1P1B1P2/P1PB2PP/R2Q1RNK b - -',Giving black the point.

Because there is no way I am going to allow black to get his bishop or knight to d5 with tempo. The white e pawn is not going to move! Well at least not for a long while. It allows me to get my rooks connected so a rook exchange initiated by black will help get my a rook into the action. This black bishop move is in my opinion his first unproductive move and allows me some chances. ;)
1374,39,22,1Qe2,b'r4rk1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/pp1p4/3pP3/1P1B4/P1PBQ1PP/R4RNK b - -',So perhaps I could have traded rooks here; but now at least my queen is not on the back rank.
1375,39,23,1a4,b'r4rk1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/p2pP3/1P1B4/P1PBQ1PP/R4RNK w - -',Black continues on the queenside but perhaps should have traded rooks here. So I seize that opportunity myself.
1376,39,24,2Rxf8+,b'r4Rk1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/p2pP3/1P1B4/P1PBQ1PP/R5NK b - -',I am down a little material; but I want to get some counter play against the black king and distract black from that queenside for at least a little bit.
1377,39,25,2Nf3,b'5rk1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/p2pP3/1P1B1N2/P1PBQ1PP/R6K b - -',I use the tempo to get my knight to a better square. I want my rook on f1 and have time to get there without worsening my pawn structure on the queenside when the black a pawn takes my b pawn.
1378,39,26,2Ra8,b'r5k1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/p2pP3/1P1B1N2/P1PBQ1PP/R6K w - -',I have decided now to let black have his way on that a file in favor of trying to harass the black kingside in return. My king potentially remains vulnerable to back rank mates I'll have to watch that.
1379,39,27,Ra2,b'6k1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/3pP3/1P1B1N2/r1PBQ1PP/5R1K w - -',This move does not initially do anything although it puts pressure on the 2nd rank of course. Black will push his pawns hoping for a material gain on the queenside. However he is in time trouble now and does not pick out the best moves while I am able to just simply push the position a bit on the kingside and thereby wrest the initiative from black shortly. Because of his time trouble and the tricky pawn position black loses his way in a bit.
1380,39,28,2Qf2,b'6k1/2q3bp/1np1b1p1/1p1p4/3pP3/1P1B1N2/r1PB1QPP/5R1K b - -',Qf2. Here I want my queen in front for greater flexibility as I harass the black king. After a short think black makes an inaccurate move.
1381,39,29,2c5,b'6k1/2q3bp/1n2b1p1/1ppp4/3pP3/1P1B1N2/r1PB1QPP/5R1K w - -',Now I'll be able to fight back.

Black still has the two bishop advantage and wants to keep it. But the position is now dangerous for black; so the seemingly natural move he makes is not the right one.
1383,39,31,2Bc8,b'2b3k1/2q3bp/1n4p1/1ppp2N1/3pP3/1P1B4/r1PB1QPP/5R1K w - -',Black intends Bb7 so as to have pressure down the a8-h1 diagonal. But he doesn't have time for that plan to come to fruition. White is able now with tactics to force concessions from black as white grabs the initiatve firmly. I was happy to move the natural looking...
1384,39,32,2Qh4,b'2b3k1/2q3bp/1n4p1/1ppp2N1/3pP2Q/1P1B4/r1PB2PP/5R1K b - -',Qh4! And suddenly black is in a bit of trouble.
1385,39,33,2Nf7,b'2b3k1/2q2Nb1/1n4pp/1ppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B4/r1PB2PP/5R1K b - -',I liked this move. What will black choose to do?
1386,39,34,2Qxf7,b'2b3k1/5qb1/1n4pp/1ppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B4/r1PB2PP/5R1K w - -',Black chooses to give back the point. Now in this position both our times are getting low. Black has less than 20 seconds and I have less than a minute. I fail to see Qd8+ but my King still has a backrank mate issue anyways. At this point the game continuation is still heavily favoring white now ::EDITED:: Qd8 after further looking here is crushing; the backrank mate is not going to be an issue: Qd8+! with the knight en prise if black moves the king RxQ and the white bishop or rook could move to f1 to block a check; and if black moves the queen or bishop the rook simply takes the queen and after it's recapture white gets to g1 and there is no more backrank mate issue and the game here is for all purposes decided after one of the two minor black pieces on the queenside falls.
1387,39,35,2g3,b'2b5/5kb1/1n4pp/1ppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B2P1/r1PB3P/7K b - -',Kg1 was probably better.
1388,39,36,2Bb7,b'8/1b3kb1/1n4pp/1ppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B2P1/r1PB3P/7K w - -',Now black is down to 14 seconds and blunders. Here I was contemplating Bxh6 and had my mouse holding the bishop. Then I realized trading now would hamper my firepower for closing the deal; and as I pondered that I saw that Qf4 was just winning and tried to set my bishop back down. But while holding it the mouse had drifted. We've all done this had a mouse slip at an inopportune time. So for all of you who have taken the time to read this recognize that the game is really not worth following after this point; this is the winning position for white will gain major material on the queenside and even with best play black will not be able to stop a mating attack. Blah blah blah! Mouse slip. But here is what happened...
1389,39,37,3Ba5,b'8/1b3kb1/1n4pp/Bppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B2P1/r1P4P/7K b - -',Ouch! Kudos to the mouse. Now the position is a draw if black takes the bishop. However black was in a rush and whether because he knew it was a slip or wanted to do something else he does not take it.
1390,39,38,Nf6,b'3B4/1b3kb1/5npp/1ppp4/3pP2Q/1P1B2P1/2P3KP/r7 w - -',And another blunder by black Nf6. Finally the e pawn is free to move.
1391,39,39,Ne4,b'3B4/1b3kb1/6pp/1pppP3/3pn2Q/1P1B2P1/2P3KP/r7 w - -',So the game would have been a bit better without the mouse slip. At this point white just finishes:
1392,39,40,3Qxb7,b'3B2k1/1Q4b1/6pp/1pppP3/3pn3/1P1B2P1/2P3KP/r7 b - -',And now an overwhelming white advantage. Here black has no real good moves left and decides he can't tolerate that e pawn and takes it.
1393,39,41,3Qxd5+,b'3B2k1/8/6pp/1ppQb3/3pn3/1P1B2P1/2P3KP/r7 b - -',After this move black quit the game because there is no way to survive further material loss and there is also an upcoming mate in several moves. I was disappointed that the mouse slip upset the normal evolution of the game. Hope you enjoyed this one!
