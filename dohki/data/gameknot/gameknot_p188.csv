1,0,1,c3,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Not really necessary. The London attack must be played without any time loss and this move is not really necessary. I must have played the g/h pawns inmediately. 
2,0,2,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PPQN1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',"Anyway due to the passive play from black the position have been reached. 
Now more aggressive for white is g4 but sooner or later Qc2 must be played in order to give some threat to the kingside so it's ok. "

4,0,4,1Bf8,b'r2qrbk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1ppn2/8/3P1B2/2PBPN1P/PPQN1PP1/R3K1R1 w Q -',A very nice defensive move aiming to support the center break e5.

9,0,9,1Bg3,b'4rb1k/pbpn2p1/1p2qn2/4p3/6P1/2P1P1BP/PPQN1P2/R3K1R1 b Q -',I have +1 material but in fact my attack has vanished. I need some tempoes in order to reasset my pieces and this gives time to black to get the best from his active pieces.

15,0,15,2Nxb3,b'3r1b1k/p1p3p1/bp2q3/4p3/6PB/1nP1nP1P/PP3K2/R4NR1 w - -',If I go BxR just NxR gives him a stounding advantage.

18,1,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',English I used to despise both playing and playing against this opening but as with most openings by playing it and playing against it more I have come to view it in a slightly better light by finding lines I enjoy. 
19,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't enjoy the reversed Sicilian positions as much and want to try to open the game up if possible.

23,1,5,d4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - d3',Structure is nearly symmetrical but Black's turn to move now not sure yet if I want to play the b8 knight on the king or queenside I play...
24,1,6,Ne4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3p4/3Pn3/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',A more immediate line aggressively posting the knight.

26,1,8,1Qb3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3p1b2/3Pn3/1QN2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Since Bf5 was not a response to Qb3 we have not transposed back into my database. The queen double attacks the pawns on d5 and b7.

28,1,10,1Nxd5,b'rn3rk1/pp1qppbp/6p1/3N1b2/3Pn3/1Q3NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This pawn looks double attacked but White cannot take. The knight will now be pinned to the Queen and after 11. Qxd5 Nxc3 White is in trouble since 12. Qxd7 Nxe3+ comes with check
29,1,11,1Nxe7+,b'rn3rk1/pp1qNpbp/4b1p1/8/3Pn3/1Q3NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',escapes with two pawns for the piece.

31,1,13,Nd6,b'rn3rk1/pp2qpbp/3n2p1/3P1b2/7N/1Q4P1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - -',After 14... Bd7 15. Qe3 black's feeling the pressure.

37,1,19,bxc5,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/3n2p1/2pP4/7N/1P4P1/1P3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',A weaker pawn but White's d5 is isolated and b-file is doubled. Trading pieces helps black's as now he has a knight for just a single pawn. 
38,1,20,Bxb2,b'r4rk1/p4p1p/R2P2p1/1np5/7N/1P4P1/1b3P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Snatching a pawn and now white is a full piece down. Needed this pawn to go if I ever wanted the bishop on c3. The d-pawn will not promote anytime soon. 
39,1,21,Bd4,b'r4rk1/p2P1p1p/R5p1/1np5/3b3N/1P4P1/5P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Thought about bringing the bishop to a3 then b4 but this seemed to round-about and on d4 it helps close the file to White's e1 rook. Even though this invites Nf3 bringing the knight back into the game but trades will help Black and it will give me a chance to re-position my knight. 
40,1,22,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/p2P1p1p/R5p1/1np5/3b4/1P3NP1/5P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Looking to eliminate this pawn before it becomes too much of a threat.

43,1,25,Ne6,b'r2r2k1/p2PRp1p/3Rn1p1/2p5/3b4/1P3NP1/5P1P/6K1 w - -',! With the much needed knight maneuver everything is protected and the e7 rook is trapped!  
44,1,26,cxd4,b'r2r2k1/p2PRp1p/3Rn1p1/8/3p4/1P4P1/5P1P/6K1 w - -',Another trade which just helps Black. The f-pawn can't kick the knight in time to save the rook. 
45,1,27,3Rdxe6,b'r2r1k2/p2PRp1p/4R1p1/8/3p4/1P4P1/5PKP/8 b - -',Accepting the inevitable and sacrificing the exchange although in reality White's able to resign here. 
46,1,28,3Rxh7,b'r2r1k2/p2P3R/4p1p1/8/3p4/1P4P1/5PKP/8 b - -',The d-pawn will fall and Black will be able to promote shortly. 
47,1,29,3e5,b'r2r1k2/p2P3R/6p1/4p3/3p4/1P4P1/5PKP/8 w - -',First the d-pawn needs to be protected from both the advancing king and a rook move to h4. 
48,1,30,a5,b'r2r1k2/3P3R/6p1/p3p3/3p4/1P3KP1/5P1P/8 w - a6',Now the rook will come to a7 and the d-pawn's doomed. 
49,1,31,3Ke4,b'r2r1k2/3P3R/6p1/p3p3/3pK3/1P4P1/5P1P/8 b - -',White can't take on e5 of course due to ...d3!
50,1,32,Kf6,b'3r4/r2P3R/5kp1/p3p3/3pK3/1P4P1/5P1P/8 w - -',White's out of options now.

52,1,34,3Rh6,b'3r4/3r4/5kpR/p3p3/3pK2P/1P4P1/5P2/8 b - -',Another weak square. White doesn't want to trade off his one remaining piece and hopes he can start something after 39. h5 but black has other ideas in mind. 
53,1,35,3Kg7,b'3r4/3r2k1/6pR/p3p3/3pK2P/1P4P1/5P2/8 w - -',! The rook is trapped again only now White can't sac an exchange to free it. 0-1 
54,2,0,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But since I didn't tried  that for a long time I accepted this time to see how it went.
55,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',Not very good my first mistake here. I didn't checked the possibility that the knight could capture the pawn. I was expecting dxe5 and force a early queen exchange. But even that was a bad play because the knight in f6 and the c4 pawn would be under attack.
56,2,2,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/5n2/1p2N3/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq b6',I think that this should have been my best play earlier so I did it now.
57,2,3,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/5n2/1pp1N3/P1pP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',Again not a good play. My queen side became all opened and my pawns under stress.

60,2,6,cxd4,b'rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/4bn2/1P2N3/Q1pp4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',I was expecting the b5 advance and protect the check with a knight so I tried to gain some strength in the center and eventually put some pressure on the white king.
61,2,7,1b6+,b'rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1P2bn2/4N3/Q1B5/4p3/1P3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Now here comes the attack!

63,2,9,1b7,b'r2qkb1r/pP1n1ppp/4bn2/4N3/Q1B5/4p3/1P3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',That was not a strong play... the pawn in e3 is in a dangerous position a exf2+ puts the king in check. White b6 pawn although under attack and seemingly unprotected was not in danger.  
64,2,10,1Rb8,b'1r1qkb1r/pP1n1ppp/4bn2/4N3/Q1B5/4p3/1P3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQk -',Now the pawn is in danger.
65,2,11,Rxb7,b'3qkb1r/pr1n1ppp/4bn2/4N3/Q1B5/4B3/1P3PPP/RN2K2R w KQk -',A glimpse of hope. The rook controls the b line and make way to Bb7+ putting the bishop in c4 unprotected and allowing black to castle.
66,2,12,Bxc4,b'3qk2r/Br1n1ppp/5n2/4N3/Qbb5/2N5/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQk -',Now white is under pressure without the possibility to castle king side.

68,2,14,1Ne5+,b'4k2r/Br2qppp/5n2/4N3/Qbb5/2N5/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQk -',Now the knight is pinned and unprotected.

72,2,18,2Qxb4,b'4k2r/5ppp/8/1b2q3/1Q2n3/2N5/1PK2PPP/r3R3 b k -',Not a good move again the knight is now freed so Rxe4 would have been better. Although it would lead to 21. Rxe4 Qxe4+ 22.Kxe4 Ba4 pinning the white queen with the bishop. 
73,2,19,Rxb2+,b'4k2r/5ppp/8/1N2q3/1Q2n3/1K6/1r3PPP/8 w k -',I enjoyed this game because of the great comeback and it also taught me to stay away from the queen gambit. A thanks to my opponent for this thrilling game.

Most of my wins involving mating attacks have involved Class C or Class D players.  Just for once my opponent was just 30 points shy of being a fellow Class A Player at the start of our game.  Yet he resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate on move 21.  You are no doubt wondering how in the heck did I manage to overcome passivitis in this game!  Well read on.  This game starts as a 3 knights opening the fireworks begin on move 4."
75,3,1,Nxe5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nxe5 - first a black pawn on e5 drops.

That pawn on d6 reminds me of this game - http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/barmy-army-mini-tournament-pawn-stab?gm=18890 in which I went on to win.

Ne5 - that move is very annoying but I thought that I would have the beginnings of a mating attack by first putting Glenda on f4 and then doing a knight tour!  This little Tour de France involves Nd1-e3-f5 should black decide to castle kingside and defend his f6 pawn with his king.
86,3,12,1Qxg4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2pP1p1p/8/4P1Q1/2N3P1/PPP3KP/R4R2 b kq -',18. Qxg4 - that pesky knight swipes off Fou Leblanc.  However it does mean that Glenda controls the g column.

Raf1 - even if black manages to get the Witch off the back row and castle queenside Old Matey will catch up with him on the back row thanks to the pawn on d6.  Black acknowledges this and waves the white flag and I found myself 9 rating points the richer - nice!
90,4,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',To avoid the Ruy Lopez which she always seemed to win quickly with against me. This time it didn't help.

103,5,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Dunst Opening. An unusual opening move that develops a knight and pressures the central light squares. The reasons for its unpopularity are that it does not prevent Black from occupying the center (unlike 1.Nf3) and that it blocks White's c pawn from advancing.
104,5,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Not a standard response to the Dunst Opening. The usual response is 1...d5 which occupies the center and threatens to attack White's knight if not blocked.
105,5,2,e4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',The standard continuation of the Dunst Opening. White occupies the center protected by her knight.

However this hangs her bishop at a4. A better response to the fork would have been the more aggressive 17.Bxb5+ which would have forced Black to defer the execution of his fork while he responded to the attack on his king.

Black notices that the White king's movement is constrained; if Black's rook could make it to e8 the king would be in checkmate.

Instead he follows White's tune and goes along with the exchange. 

Figure it out?  The Black Queen has the White King on the same file with only a Pawn in between.  If he moves the Pawn out of the way the King will be in check.  The Bishop can jump in between but White has nothing protecting g5 so the Queen could take that and again call check  The White King only has 2 possible moves.

I have forgotten to annotate a couple of games in the Annotations Project Part 2. Both of these were against Class C Opposition.  I will remedy that right now.  The first one is against Graham (Goatfodder) who is a bit like The Dentist i.e. ok up to late/middlegame and will then make a mistake that will let me into the game big time and then go on to win it.  I will start the commentary on Move 9 as the previous moves are fairly standard to this particular opening. "

282,13,10,g6,b'3rr2k/2p4p/ppp1qpp1/4p3/1P2PnPN/P2PQ2P/1RP2P1K/5R2 w - -',As it turned out this move was very important later in the game. At the time I was just trying to restrict my opponent's space and force him into accepting a draw.
283,13,11,2Kxg2,b'3rr2k/2p4p/ppp1qpp1/4p3/1P2P1P1/P2PQ2P/1RP2PK1/5R2 b - -',The last minor pieces vanish.
284,13,12,Qxe5,b'3rr3/2p3kp/ppp2pp1/4q3/1P2P1P1/P2PQ2P/1RP3K1/5R2 w - -',Position is still very even.
285,13,13,3c4,b'1r3r2/2p3kp/ppp2pp1/4q3/PPP1P1P1/3PQ2P/1R4K1/1R6 b - c3',I was hoping somewhere along the line White would play P-QN5? enabling me to undouble my Pawns.
286,13,14,Qe7,b'1r6/2prq1kp/ppp2pp1/8/PPPPP1P1/4Q2P/3R2K1/2R5 w - -',Slow maneuvering. Neither side seems willing to force the pace hereabouts...
287,13,15,axb5,b'1r6/2prq1kp/2p2pp1/1pP5/1P1PP1P1/4Q2P/3R2K1/2R5 w - -',The QR file is now open. But the position is still stagnant. Now I'm hoping for White to play P-Q5? again enabling me to undouble my Pawns.
288,13,16,Rbc8,b'2rrq3/2p3kp/R1p2pp1/1pP5/1P1PPQP1/7P/3R2K1/8 w - -',Now White zeroes in on the doubled QB-pawns. I defend but at this point losing one of the doubled Pawns won't affect my position much as they don't have the effect of more than a single Pawn anyway.
289,13,17,4e5,b'2r1q3/R1pr2kp/2p2pp1/1pP1P3/1P1P1QP1/7P/3R2K1/8 b - -',White gives up on the doubled Pawns for a moment and instead aims to create a passed K pawn.
290,13,18,Rxd2+,b'2r1q3/R1p3kp/2p3p1/1pP1P3/1P3QP1/7P/3r2K1/8 w - -',He gets his passed Pawn but at the cost of vaporizing a pair of Rooks.
291,13,19,Qe7,b'2r4k/R1p1q2p/2p3p1/1pP1P3/1P3QP1/7P/6K1/8 w - -',I have effectively blockaded the position. Even if White wins the P on my QB3 the Q-side Pawns will remain obstructed.
292,13,20,4exf6,b'2r4k/R1p4p/2p2Pp1/1pP5/1P4P1/7P/6K1/8 b - -',The Queens are next to fall. Now the importance of ...P-KN3 becomes clear. White cannot support his KB pawn's further advance with P-KN6 and thus the KB pawn cannot reach the 7th rank safely.
293,13,21,Kf7,b'2r5/R1p2k1p/2p2Pp1/1pP3P1/1P6/7P/6K1/8 w - -',The Pawn is blockaded again. White will be unable to break through.
294,13,22,c6,b'2r5/5k1p/R1p2Pp1/1pP3P1/1P6/7P/6K1/8 w - -',I let the doubled Pawn fall as it is now irrelevant. Unless White can get his K in a position to support the KBP he has no winning chances at all.
295,13,23,Rf8,b'5rk1/4R2p/2p2Pp1/1pP3P1/1P6/7P/6K1/8 w - -',With only the Rook in support the Pawn is frozen on KB6.
296,13,24,5Kf3,b'2r3k1/7p/2p1RPp1/1pP3P1/1P6/5K1P/8/8 b - -',White finally tries to bring his King forward. But the P on KN3 cuts off the K-side entry squares.
297,13,25,Rxb4,b'6k1/7p/2R2Pp1/1pP3P1/1r6/5K1P/8/8 w - -',White exchanges a pair of Q-side Pawns simplifying the game but not making any progress.
298,13,26,Rc3,b'8/5k1p/1RP2Pp1/1p4P1/8/2r4P/6K1/8 w - -',Inviting White to exchange the last of the Q-side Pawns.
299,13,27,Rxc6,b'8/5k1p/2r2Pp1/1R4P1/8/7P/6K1/8 w - -',He accepts.
300,13,28,Rc5,b'8/5k1p/5Pp1/2r3P1/8/1R5P/6K1/8 w - -',I aim to remove the supporting Pawn on KN5 and capture White's KBP.
301,13,29,Kf8,b'5k2/6Rp/5Pp1/2r3P1/8/7P/6K1/8 w - -',White is out of checks. I'm more than willing to trade my KRP for his KNP.
302,13,30,Rxg5+,b'5k2/7R/5Pp1/6r1/8/7P/6K1/8 w - -',Now I have the initiative because of the check which will enable me to capture the KBP.
303,13,31,Rf5,b'5k2/7R/5Pp1/5r2/8/7P/7K/8 w - -',It's all over but the shouting.
304,13,32,Rxf7,b'5k2/5r1R/6p1/8/8/7P/7K/8 w - -',Draw finally agreed. My opponent could have taken it much earlier but apparently he's allergic to draws. A long and hard-fought game.
305,14,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I believe this is the best reply to 1. e4 and because it's so good I have a hard time convincing myself to learn a second defence to 1. e4. The Sicilian is so rich with ideas and the games are very dynamic and full with counter-chances for Black something you really don't get in other openings. The only other opening I dabble in is the Alekhine but that's just for blitz purposes. 
306,14,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',The open Sicilian. The battleground on which many games have been fought and there is still some discussion on the correctness of White's approach. Some have called this exchange positionally wrong but in practice White has a lot of attacking chances.
307,14,2,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',The only problem I have with this defence is that White can avoid it. Other than that I still haven't found a line that causes me great a deal of concern.
308,14,3,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The best move. Many beginners or amateurs play 6. Nxc6 after which White is worse. 
309,14,4,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',6...a6 is a dubious variation that might work out in OTB but in CC it would just be asking for trouble.
310,14,5,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The most aggressive approach. Trying to play slow in the Sicilian is tantamount to an early resignation.
311,14,6,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1np1n2/1p2p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq b6',Here White has to deal with the threat of b4 and he can do this in two ways. The positional line that was my opponent play and the sharper line exchanging on f6 after which there are many lines and many ideas for both sides.
312,14,7,Ne7,b'r1bqk2r/4nppp/p2p1b2/1p1Np3/4P3/N1P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A rather recent development and a personal favourite. Black decides that he doesn't mind the doubled pawns and doesn't want to let White settle in with Nc2 and a4.
313,14,8,1Nxf6+,b'r1bqk2r/4nppp/p2p1N2/1p2p3/4P3/N1P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Playing 12. Nc2 doesn't promise much after 12...Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Rb8. After 12. Nxe7 Bxe7 Black will soon play either f5 or d5 and open up lines for his two Bishops.
314,14,9,1Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/4np1p/p2p1p2/1p2p3/4P3/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',13. c4 is the more brutal way of playing but after 13...Bb7 14. cxb5 Bxe4 15. Qa4 d5 16. bxa6+ Kf8 Black has enough compensation.
315,14,10,1d5,b'r1bqk2r/4np1p/p4p2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',One of the perks of this system is that you can play d5 early and get rid of the weak pawn.
316,14,11,1Qe2,b'r1bqk2r/4np1p/p4p2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP2QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',A sensible move White develops his Queen and overprotects e4. There is another fine point to this move. White is waiting to see what I'm going to do about the King. There are a few positions where an early castle is very perilous. 
317,14,12,1Be6,b'r2qk2r/4np1p/p3bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP2QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Not particularly spirited developing on the long diagonal was probably better at this point but after that the elegance of White's 14th is revealed. White could reply with 15. 0-0-0 now that the Bishop is aimed at the K-side White places the King on the other flank. However Black's best move is 14...Ng6 and after 15. g3 d4 16. cxd4 Qxd4 17. Rd1 Qb4+ 18. Qd2 Qxd2+ 19. Rxd2 h5 there is still a tense struggle going on on both sides of the board.
318,14,13,1Nc2,b'r2qk2r/4np1p/p3bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PB4/PPN1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',The bad Knight is getting recycled and sent to a better spot. White is still in no rush to castle.
319,14,14,1Qb6,b'r3k2r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PB4/PPN1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',The best place for the Queen in this line. This is connected to castling long since without the dark square Bishop the K-side is a perilous place.
320,14,15,1Ne3,b'r3k2r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PP2QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White has regrouped his pieces and is now ready to castle.

322,14,17,1Qc2,b'2kr3r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',It looks like White wants to take complete control of e4 and f5. Also the Queen is very well placed for an a4 strike.
323,14,18,1Rhg8,b'2kr2r1/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',The advantage of doubled pawns are open lines. I activate my Rook and prompt White to castle.
324,14,19,1O-O,b'2kr2r1/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',18. a4 leads to a forced sequence where most of the pieces come off after 18...dxe4 19. Bxe4 f5 20. Nxf5 Nxf5 21. Bxf5 Rxg2 22. axb5 axb5 23. Ra8+ Kc7 24. Rxd8 Kxd8 25. Bxe6 Qxe6 26. Qxh7. White has won a pawn but the ending is about equal.
325,14,20,1Kb8,b'1k1r2r1/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Taking precautions that a White Rook won't land on a8.

Exchanging on d5 leads to a drawish endgame after 19. exd5 Nxd5 20. Nxd5 Bxd5 21. Be4 Bxe4 22. Qxe4 Qb7 23. Qxb7+ Kxb7. An interesting possibility was 19. a4 when it's difficult to find a good answer for Black.

345,14,40,Qxe4,b'1k6/3r1p1p/p4p2/Qp6/3NqP2/1b4P1/7P/2R3K1 w - -',I didn't want to concede and played for more while accepting less. There was no doubt that White has a better ending but I hopped that I could secure good chances with two pawns for the Knight. My opponent must have been pleased with my decision.
346,14,41,Kb6,b'8/3r1p1p/pk3p2/1p6/5P2/1N4P1/7P/2R3K1 w - -',This ending is very treacherous and for a particular reason. My K-side pawn structure is in shambles and should it come under attack the pawns will drop like flies. If there were no Rooks on the board it would be even worse. But I thought I could advance the pawns faster than the White King could march to the Q-side and free the Knight to go on a rampage on the K-side.
347,14,42,3Nd4,b'8/3r1p1p/1k3p2/1p6/p2N1P2/4K1P1/7P/2R5 b - -',Now White can begin to attack my pawns.
348,14,43,3Ka5,b'8/3r1p1p/5p2/kp6/p2N1P2/4K1P1/7P/2R5 w - -',I realized that my best chance was to trade the two pawns for the Knight and try to level the game in the Rook endgame.
349,14,44,4Rc5,b'8/3r1p1p/5p2/kpR5/p2N1P2/4K1P1/7P/8 b - -',White could have postponed this decision but it's very instructive that he didn't. He can't improve his position and pushing pawns on the K-side only helps me since he would be taking away entry points for his pieces. Also 40. Kd3 fails to 40...a3 and if White tries to play 41. Rc5 he's suddenly lost after 41...a2.
350,14,45,Re7+,b'8/4rp1p/5p2/R7/p1kN1P2/4K1P1/7P/8 w - -',Very important or else I can't capture the Knight because of Rxa4+.
351,14,46,Kd5,b'8/4rp1p/5p2/3k4/R4P2/5KP1/7P/8 w - -',I thought I could hold this position but there is a particular line that wins for White. The winning move is 45. Kg4!. The King is the best attacker here and after 45...Re2 46. Kf5! Rxh2 47. Kxf6 Rg2 48. Kxf7 Rxg3 49. f5 with a typical won Rook endgame.
352,14,47,4Ra6,b'8/4rp1p/R4p2/3k4/5P2/5KP1/7P/8 b - -',After this I escape by the skin of my teeth.
353,14,48,Ke6,b'8/r4p1p/4k3/5R2/5P2/5KP1/7P/8 w - -',The main reason why 45. Kg4 was winning was because White could get his King in front of the pawn and my King couldn't do anything about the march of the f-pawn.
354,14,49,5Rh5,b'8/7p/4kp2/7R/5PP1/r7/5K1P/8 b - -',Going for a forced line that leads to a drawn K+K endgame.

356,14,51,5Rg6,b'8/7p/4kprR/6P1/5P2/8/5K1P/8 w - -',I force the exchange of Rooks and get a pawn on g6 after which I can hold off the White King from achieving anything.

With hindsight I think my logic is a little flawed as white has lost his dsb and so I should be looking to take advantage of that fact by using my dsb

In the mainline Colle-Zukertort System White's queenside bishop moves to b2 to exert additional pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal; indeed this is the purpose of playing b3 in the first place. Nonetheless White's formation still holds Black's pawns at d5 and e6 and causes mobility problems for Black.

For example if Black played 16...dxc4 White could recapture with 17.Nxc4 attacking the queen and leaving it with no way to escape. On the other hand if Black ignored White's pawn on c4 the pawn could advance on the next turn to c5 and threaten the queen directly. Black would have responses that save the queen but most would come at a cost.

White's queen seems to be aiming for something here—perhaps trying to exert pressure on Black's g pawn or perhaps aiming to reinforce the rook on the open b file--but she inadvertently hangs her g pawn.

Operation Joblock has resulted in another Expert Draw for me.   Dongoodman has kindly commented on my previous annotations so I thought it would be nice to challenge him.  The endgame worked out well.  I believed I was able to lock him out so I offered him a draw and he accepted it.  So how did this happen?  We pick up the action on Move 5 where I castled short.  The opening is a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation."

I am now threatening Ne4 because if the Wicked Witch of the West does try the fork trick then she will be pinned to her other half by my rook on e1 and lost.  Black now backs up the e5 pawn with Bd6.

646,29,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The usual move developing and avoiding a queen check on h4. A sharper variant is 3. Bc4 which I haven't really tried out so far because I'm a bit uncomfortable when my king has to move that early in the game (the opponent can force that simply with 3... Qh4+ but I've heard once that it isn't a good move at all) and hence castling king's side isn't possible anymore.

The King's Gambit often leads to quick wins but of course also quick losses due to a very vulnerable king-side so every move has to be played precisely.

Another chastening defeat at the hands of the Master Mater.  Just when I thought I was learning to avoid destructive trades what does The Beginner do?  She goes in for one doesn't she?  In mitigation it was to rid myself of Freddy's rook that had just got into my area of the board and when a piece like that does that you wanna get shot of it at the earliest opportunity wouldn't you?  Well sometimes it is better to just hold your horses a bit.  The game starts off with 1. e5 c5 which is a Sicilian Defense."
