57,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"""William Davies Evans was born on Musland Farm St. Dogwell's North Pembrokeshire Wales UK.
It was in 1824 whilst commanding a steam packet that sailed between Milford in Wales and Waterford in Ireland he invented the gambit for which he became famous. Its original form was 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 5.b4. 
He also is credited for discovering that the ""Little Game of Chess"" (an endgame composition involving only two kings with three pawns each) is actually won for the player who moves first not drawn as had been believed for over a hundred years."" chessgames.com
This is one of Evan's games where he plays his renound gambit. I hope you like it. It is a very entertaining one.

58,2,1,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',This is the Evans Gambit. This romantic gambit has proven to be greatly resilient to modern technology while it is not generally thought of as a path to advantage it hasn't been refuted(correct me if I'm wrong).The idea of this opening is to gain momentum while opening the centre. this is often at the expense of a pawn or two.For this reason this line of the Guoco Piano has often attracted attention from more aggressive players and and will probably continue to do so in the future. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times.  He even used it to beat none other than ANAND! Pretty good surprise weaponno?
59,2,2,Bxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative. I don't agree with this in all cases however in this case i do partly. 
60,2,3,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre.
61,2,4,Ba5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This retreat is probably the most natural responce to the Evans Gambit.The e1-a5 diagonal pinning the c3 and d2 pawns for the momentand more importantly is not in any kind of trouble on a5. or instance it would be in danger on c5 because of d4. Or 5.Be7 which is solid yet deemed passive by experts On the other side though white will be able to put pressure on blacks position with Ba3 later on Black's plan to meet this is with d2-d3 i would pick this option as in the games I have played with it has neutralized whites pressure with no positional disadvatages.( not for black anyway!)
62,2,5,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',A fairly logical move. Now the pin on black's bishop on white's king has been removed. However another fairly rare move is the side line 6.Qb3!? 
63,2,6,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',As I said. Again logical solidifying the e5 pawn and also stopping the danger of Ba3.
64,2,7,Bg4,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b3p3/2BPP1b1/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',?! This looks a decent developing move at first which also seems provides a useful pin. Howver earlier I mentioned 6.Qb3. This move would have  effectively pinned black's light squared bishop to b7. Now white can play it with an extra edge.
65,2,8,Qb3,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b3p3/2BPP1b1/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',This attacks the f7 pawn and removes the pin. However what has made this move even more powerful is the fact that because of black's last move has left the pawn on b7 now hanging.
66,2,9,Qd7,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/2np4/b3p3/2BPP1b1/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',This is a good move in this situation. It defends the f7 square. 
67,2,10,Ng5,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/2np4/b3p1N1/2BPP1b1/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Many beginners in chess would immediately take the pawn on b7 without thinking. However thats what keeps their rating so low. Capt. Evans decides to keep the attack on. If white does do 9.Qxb7 black can simply exchange with 9... Bxf3 this damages whites pawn structure and leaves his king in danger. The materialwill be equal which will make the novice content however black will have the upperhad. Also blacks queen can be blocked in.
68,2,11,Nd8,b'r2nk1nr/pppq1ppp/3p4/b3p1N1/2BPP1b1/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',"This defends b7 and f7. As you can see white's kingside is completely developed and his king is castled;also most of whites pieces are are in powerful attacking positions. Where as black's pieces are scattered around the board in awkward positions such as the bishop on a5 and the knight on d8.  Also blacks king is in the middle of the board in mortal danger.

70,2,13,1Ba3,b'r2nk1nr/pppq1ppp/8/b3p1N1/2B1P1b1/BQP5/P4PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Did you get it? This move is now worth while because the pawn on d6 has been removed. It build tension on the kingside and prevents black from castling kinside.
71,2,14,1Nh6,b'r2nk2r/pppq1ppp/7n/b3p1N1/2B1P1b1/BQP5/P4PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',This defends f7 although it is now a very passive piece.

He could have plyed 16...Qf6 which is a much better defence which just about brings him back into the game and would have given him a chance of survivng. He did avoid another blunderif 16...Nxf7 then 17.Bb5  c6 18.Qe6  Qe7 19.Qxe7 mate. 16...Bxf7 runs into 17.Bxf7  Nxf7 18.Qe6  Qe7 Qxe7 mate. The same happens with 16...Bxf7

81,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The following game in the Dragon Sicilian (with 10..Rb8!?) is full of flavor but at the expense of objective and practical inaccuracies on both sides. Nevertheless it is an enjoyable game and certainly instructive in how the creation of tactical maelstroms often favors the attacking player (e.g. the one with the most options).
82,3,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -','!' - Well not exactly! In any event Black is quite pleased to enter into his pet Dragon variation.
83,3,2,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',The 9.Bc4 variation of the Yugoslav Attack which is generally White's most aggressive option planning a kingside pawn storm (or simply h4-h5) with ideas like Bh6 and Nd5 etc. This is a fun variation to explore for both sides though it has regrettably been usurped in popularity by the more positionally-minded 9.0-0-0 (when the Bf1 stays home).
84,3,3,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',!? - Black opts for the 'Chinese Dragon' instead of the more mainline ...Rac8 or ...Qa5 plans. Here Black plans to play ...b5 and answer the eventual ...Bxc4 with bxc4 when his rook is ideally placed along the b-file.
85,3,4,1g4,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R b - g3','?' - A strangely popular mistake. Maybe some text has recommended this move? In any case White now weakens his f3 pawn. when ideas like ..b5 and ..Ne5 are more dangerous for the first player. Much better is simply 11.h4 or 11.Bb3.
86,3,5,1b5,b'1r1q1rk1/p2bppbp/2np1np1/1p6/2BNP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R w - b6','!' - Not bothering with the typical ...Ne5. Black hopes to rip open queenside lines with gain of time.
87,3,6,1Bb3,b'1r1q1rk1/p2bppbp/2np1np1/1p6/3NP1P1/1BN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R b - -',Also typical is 12. Ndxb5 but not 12.Bxb5? when Black's ..Nxd4 reply is simply winning.
88,3,7,1a5,b'1r1q1rk1/3bppbp/2np1np1/pp6/3NP1P1/1BN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R w - a6',or ..b4!?
89,3,8,Ne5,b'1r1q1rk1/3bppbp/3p1np1/pN2n3/3NP1P1/1B2BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R w - -','?' - This standard move now threatening the knight on b5 is dubious without the White bishop on c4 owing to the clever White reply 14.a4! creating an outpost on b5 that absolutely frustrates Black's attack. Black overlooked this move somehow. Instead Black needed to play 13..a4 himself.

Objectively the text move is fine (and certainly more in the spirit of things) but Black really should have locked up the point via ..Nh5 and queenside play.
93,3,12,1h3,b'1rr3k1/3bppbp/3p2p1/qN2n1P1/B2Nn3/1P2BP1P/P1P1Q3/2KR3R b - -',"'??' - Black's bravado apparently intimidates White into backing away from the sacrifice. Now Black is completely winning via ..Nc5 or ..Bxb5 and ..Ng3.  After fxe4 Black intended ..Nc4!? with a wild and unclear game. According to post game analysis White needs to defend a minefield of threats (and Black must play accurately in attack) to reach a drawn position. Over the board Black was simply looking to ""spice things up"" and indeed in that line Black has many mating chances."

95,3,14,1Qe1,b'1rr3k1/3bppbp/3p2p1/qN2n1P1/B2N4/1P2BPnP/P1P5/2KRQ2R b - -',"White enters this move and promptly resigns allegedly in view of ..Nd3  threats (which do not exist with accurate defense). In fact Black overwhelms instead after  the thematic 19...Rxb5! 20.Nxb5 Qa6! as the Ba4 cannot move in any scenario because of ..Qxa2 and dire threats to the White king e.g. 21. Qxg3 Nxb5 and Bxb5? is impossible and Black is a piece up with a winning attack to boot.

Nonetheless White should have forced Black to find this continuation in real play. If Black slips up White has real chances to save the game."

188,7,5,1Nd2,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn2/3p3p/2PPnPb1/1PN1P3/PB1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',fight is all around e4. white can't keep black from posting a N here but can definately exchange to reduce pressure
189,7,6,1f5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn2/3p1P1p/1bPP4/1PN1P3/PB1Q2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',I think white could have done better here. The idea behind f5 is to give black problems with his center. Although I think the idea is right it's implementation should have waited for a little. The reason i say this is that 15.f5 leaves white's queen bottled in for a few moves after 17.Bxe3. That gives black time to choose a plan of action at will. However considering that black has not yet castled and already has a weak looking K-side white should try to make things more complicated for black over the next few moves and I think the way to do that would be to keep the Q more active and then play f4. For example 15.Qc2 or Qd3 look to be promising. After 15..Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Ne4 17.Qb4 b6 18.f5 the position is the same as it would be after 17.Bxc3 in this game with the important differences that black: has 'holes' in his Q-side cannot play Qg5 (or any other attacking move) cannot safely castle on either side of the board. Additionally white's Q is better on b4 than it would be on c2.
190,7,7,Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p1P1p/2PPn3/1Pb1P3/PBQ3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',N at e4 very powerful. white's e-pawn backward and undefended
191,7,8,Qg5,b'r3k2r/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p1Pqp/2PPn3/1PB1P3/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Attacks white's backward pawn and brings in the Q to the side of the board where white's king is. I think this would be one of the problems with an advance of the f-pawn in the opening - a weak center pawn.
192,7,9,1Rf4,b'r3k2r/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p1Pqp/2PPnR2/1PB1P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 b kq -',Interesting. White could also have played Rae1 or Rf3. I haven't looked deep into this but Rf3 seems to have the advantage of the R being protected and it also allows the R to move along the 3rd rank without fear for the e-pawn.
193,7,10,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p1Pqp/2PPnR2/1PB1P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 w - -',!? allows interesting attacks for both sides. I could have kept the K in the center but that wouldn't have allowed me to push forward on the K-side. Since white seems to have a inactive Q at the moment and more pawn-problems than I it seemed that it would be a good idea to send the K off to the other side of the board and march forward on this side. But now white can press on with the pawns on the Q-side. All seems like a matter of who's attack is more fast and more sure.
194,7,11,1Ba5,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4p3/B2p1Pqp/2PPnR2/1P2P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 b - -',Threatening cxd5 with mate on c7. More importantly bringing the B to life.

197,7,14,2c5,b'2k4r/pppr1pp1/8/B1Pp1pqp/1P1PnR2/4P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 b - -',I was expecting 21.cxd5 instead. That would have opened up the c file and the Q would have been able to exert influence maybe the a1 R could also join in the fun. After 21.cxd5 b6 the bishop isn't lost for nothing because of the very nice continuation: 22.Bxb6 axb6 23.Qc6! Rd6 (otherwise Qa8  ) 24.Rc1 Qe7 25.Rxf5 and black is helpless (for example the threat of Re5).
198,7,15,2Rh6,b'2k5/pppr1pp1/7r/B1Pp1pqp/1P1PnR2/4P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 w - -',To prevent the threat of c6 followed by cxb7 and the opening of the c-file putting black's K in danger.
199,7,16,2b5,b'2k5/pppr1pp1/7r/BPPp1pqp/3PnR2/4P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 b - -',Moving on with the plan of marching the pawns forward. I still think that it would have been better for white to somehow open the c-file. The Q is so powerless in the current situation. Alternatively if white had brought it forward as suggested in my comments on 15.f5 prospects would have been brighter.
200,7,17,2h4,b'2k5/pppr1pp1/7r/BPPp1pq1/3PnR1p/4P3/P1Q3PP/R5K1 w - -',My turn to march a pawn! Aim is obvious; since white is posing no serious imminent threats on the Q-side I will now try to weaken the position around white's K with my pawn and then bring in my heavy pieces.
201,7,18,2Rb1,b'2k5/pppr1pp1/7r/BPPp1pq1/3PnR1p/4P3/P1Q3PP/1R4K1 b - -',Too slow! Achieves absolutely nothing! White will not even have time to get his pawns out of the way for the R to be able to do anything

203,7,20,2c6,b'2k5/pp1r1pp1/2p4r/BPPp1pq1/3PnRP1/4P2p/P1Q4P/1R4K1 w - -',Probably not needed could have played fxg4 straight away. But I was slightly wary of c6 by white. No harm being a bit overcautious though.
204,7,21,Qh5,b'2k5/pp1r1pp1/2r5/B1Pp3q/3Pn1R1/4P2p/P3Q2P/1R4K1 w - -',Pinning the R. Only move which doesn't loose material is Re1 (or b2) - to protect the queen. After f5 by black and a subseuqnet exchange of Qs black should be able to spoil white's central pawn chain with b6 and push his connected K-side pawns. It is a bit unclear but I think black would definately be better.
205,7,22,2Rxg7,b'2k5/pp1r1pR1/2r5/B1Pp3q/3Pn3/4P2p/P3Q2P/1R4K1 b - -',?? decisive mistake. Perhaps white thought that he was now threating mate on the back rank and also attacking black's queen. However he missed the simple continuation which black went on to play.
206,7,23,2Rg6+,b'2k5/pp1r1pR1/6r1/B1Pp3q/3Pn3/4P2p/P3Q2P/1R4K1 w - -',and now at worst black wins a R for a N.
207,7,24,Qxg6+,b'2k5/pp1r1p2/6q1/B1Pp4/3Pn3/4P2p/P3Q2P/1R4K1 w - -',the only moves for white are Kh1 or Kf1. In either case black may play Ng3 forcing white to take the N leaving black at the liberty to then play Qxb1. Black's advantage is now almost certainly winning.

White won't play Bxf6 because the g5 bishop is more important than either of the knights black is covered with dark squared holes (notice how all his pawns but one are on light squares).  White should keep his dark squared bishop to attack the undefended dark squares thus he can't exchange it for a white if he wants an advantage.  Black can also play 10... Be7 to cover f6 but 10... Nbd7 beginning black's queenside development is more popular.

Black would equalize material but he can do that almost anytime and there's no need to give white a pin.  Also for the moment the pawn on f6 gets in the way of white's bishop and black should be in no hurry to take such a helpful pawn.

Notice that black can't take on d5 for example: 13... exd5 14.Qe2  Be7 15.fxe7.  Note that if black allows the position to open the pawn on f6 suddenly becomes a huge help for white.

It can get in white's way but black has to be INCREDIBLY careful about it.  There are two alternatives to 13... Qb6 though neither are are common.  13... Bh6 trades off white's valuable dark squared bishop.  The second alternative 13... Qc7 threatens the dangerous 14... Qe5 .

267,9,23,1Bxg2,b'2kr1b1r/p2n1p2/q3PP2/2p3B1/1pp5/2N3P1/PP3PbP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Black trades because if white was allowed to take on b7 either black's king or queen would end up on the dangerous b file where white's rook is.

With this move white forces his pawns through the defensive lines.
269,9,25,1Bxf1,b'2kr1b1r/p2nPp2/q4P2/2p3B1/1pp5/2N3P1/PP3P1P/1R1Q1bK1 w - -',Black sees material and he grabs material.  If black can still defend this is a good choice if not it's a very dangerous one to go for material.  However what choice does he have?  After 18... bxc3 19.exd8=Q  followed by Kxg2 gives white a nice material edge.
270,9,26,1Qd5,b'2kr1b1r/p2nPp2/q4P2/2pQ2B1/1pp5/2N3P1/PP3P1P/1R3bK1 b - -',19.Qd5!! is a very powerful move that prepares 20.Bf4 (cutting off the square the black king can move to) followed by the winning move Qa8 .

Bxe7 is also possible it was played in the spectacular game at Dortmund 1996 Topalov-Kramnik.  Anyone who finds the opening at all exciting should definitely check out that game (maybe I'll annotate it later).  19... Bd3 (getting the bishop out of the way) loses here after 20.Bf4! (threatening 21.Qa8  Nb8 22.Qxb8  Kc7 23.exd8=Q  with a very simple win for white.  In fact the main point of 19... Bh6 is not to get the dark squared bishop it's to connect rooks so that when d8 falls it will be adequately defended.

273,9,29,2Bd3,b'2kr3r/p2nPp2/q4P1B/2pQ4/1pp5/2Nb2P1/PP3P1P/1R4K1 w - -',Black can't take back as 20...Rxh6 leaves blacks king in the danger zone (the rooks aren't connected any longer) and white must has a crazy attack coming one 21.Qa8  Nb8 22.Qxb8 ! Kxb8 23.exd8=Q  Qc8 (23... Kb7 24.Re1!! where the following Re7  will easily win for white) 24.Qd6 Qc7 (24... Kb7 25.Re1! wins with the following Re7 ) 25.Qf8  where after the tactics white is up a piece.
274,9,30,2Qa8+,b'Q1kr3r/p2nPp2/q4P1B/2p5/1pp5/2Nb2P1/PP3P1P/1R4K1 b - -',The obvious and probably correct way to continue the attack.  21.Ne4 is an interesting alternative tried by Shirov he gets his knight out of the way and prepares to use it in the attack.
275,9,31,2Nb8,b'Qnkr3r/p3Pp2/q4P1B/2p5/1pp5/2Nb2P1/PP3P1P/1R4K1 w - -',The only move as 21... Kc7 provokes 22.Bf4  1-0.
276,9,32,2Re1,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/q4P1B/2p5/1pp5/2Nb2P1/PP3P1P/4R1K1 b - -',White must move his rook out of the danger and he has threats of the powerful Re7.

278,9,34,2Qb6,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q3P2/2p5/2p2B2/2pb2P1/PP3P1P/4R1K1 w - -',The other logical move 24... Qb7 (both moves defend b8 this one tries to trade queens) loses to the pretty 25.Re7!! Qxa8 26.Rc7#.
279,9,35,2bxc3,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q3P2/2p5/2p2B2/2Pb2P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Now white retakes as there is no immediate threat.
280,9,36,2Bf5,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q3P2/2p2b2/2p2B2/2P3P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 w - -',This is a move first played to my knowledge by Shirov (a major proponent of this opening for both colors).  Black brings the bishop back to where it can enter the defense.
281,9,37,2f3,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q3P2/2p2b2/2p2B2/2P2PP1/P6P/4R1K1 b - -',26.f3!! white cannot advance his attack on the queenside (26.Re7?? loses to 26...Qb1! where black gets the attack) so he mobilizes his kingside pawn majority.  To prepare the advance of his kingside Van Wely first grabs control of the light squares he prepares to play g4 to support his h pawns advance.  This is Van Wely's novelty.  Until this game this position was considered a draw though black's defense had to be ingenious.  Check out Azmaiparashvili-Shirov to see an amazing save.
282,9,38,2Be6,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q2bP2/2p5/2p2B2/2P2PP1/P6P/4R1K1 w - -',Black gets ready to play 27... Bd5 forcing the queens off the board the position is still very dangerous.  Another way is 27... Qb7 but it's bad as shown by 28.Qxb7  Kxb7 29.Re7  Rd7 30.Bb8 Kb8 31.g4 (starting kingside expansion) 31... Be6 32.Rxe6! fxe6 33.g5 and the pawns are better than the rook analysis in this position by Geert van der Stricht in New In Chess #77.
283,9,39,2g4,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q2bP2/2p5/2p2BP1/2P2P2/P6P/4R1K1 b - -',White expands following his plan.
284,9,40,2Bd5,b'Qnkr4/p4p2/1q3P2/2pb4/2p2BP1/2P2P2/P6P/4R1K1 w - -',Black forces queens off with an extra piece but the pawns will be too strong.
285,9,41,3Kf2,b'1k1r4/p4p2/5P2/2pb4/2p3P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 b - -',White defends his f3 pawn before beginning to march (and activate his rook).
286,9,42,3h4,b'3r4/p1k2p2/5P2/2pb4/2p3PP/2P2P2/P4K2/4R3 b - h3',The kingside continues to push forward.
287,9,43,3h5,b'8/p1krRp2/5P2/2pb3P/2p3P1/2P2P2/P4K2/8 b - -',And the pawns give white an easy win notice how 26.f3!! stopped the bishop from coming to e4 and being able to stop the h pawn.  This was a highly energetic game in the botvinnik that was decided almost entirely by theory.  If anyone has corrections comments or thoughts PM me.

634,22,38,3e5,b'R1b2rk1/8/p4B1p/4P3/2P5/1P1pKn2/P4P2/R7 b - -',I protect my bishop.
635,22,39,3Bg4,b'R4rk1/8/p4B1p/4P3/2P3b1/1P1pKn2/P4P2/R7 w - -',he protects his and now if I take his rook--it will just be an exchange.
636,22,40,3Kf4,b'5k2/8/p4B1p/4P3/2P2Kb1/1P1p1n2/P4P2/R7 b - -',threatening the piece that protects his knight.  It is generally a good idea to move your king between pieces that are protecting each other.
637,22,41,3h5,b'5k2/8/p4B2/4P2p/2P2Kb1/1P1p1n2/P4P2/R7 w - -',He protects the bishop and prevents my attack from working.  He also advances a pawn that could become a queen sometime soon.
638,22,42,d2,b'5k2/8/p4B2/2P1P2p/5Kb1/1P3n2/P2p1P2/R7 w - -',I advance a pawn as does he.....
639,22,43,3Ke3,b'5k2/8/p4B2/2P1P2p/6b1/1P2Kn2/P2p1P2/R7 b - -',this move was to threaten the pawn's currently location making it impossible for him to move the knight and bring the pawn all the way across.  My rook guards the pawn from making it right now.
640,22,44,3Nxe5,b'5k2/8/p4B2/2P1n2p/6b1/1P2K3/P2p1P2/R7 w - -',He made a pawn exchange hoping that I would take his knight and not realize he was going to cross with the pawn (now protected by the bishop).  Hopewell holds on.
641,22,45,3Kxd2,b'5k2/8/p4B2/2P1n2p/6b1/1P6/P2K1P2/R7 b - -',I take the pawn exchange.
642,22,46,3Nc6,b'5k2/8/p1n2B2/2P4p/6b1/1P6/P2K1P2/R7 w - -',and he retreats with the knight--blocking off my c pawn.

646,22,50,4b4,b'8/8/2n1k3/p1Pb3p/1P5B/P1K5/5P2/3R4 b - -',here I threatened the pawn on a5.  Since this is 1 of 2 remaining pawns and he can't checkmate with a knight/bishop combination he will have to either move a4 or defend his h pawn and get a queen.
647,22,51,4axb4+,b'8/8/2n1k3/2Pb3p/1p5B/P1K5/5P2/3R4 w - -',he choses to exchange...the h pawn now becomes crucial for black's survival.
648,22,52,4Re1,b'8/8/4k3/2Pbn2p/1P5B/2K5/5P2/4R3 b - -',I attempted to pin his knight and then attack with my bishop on g3.
649,22,53,4Kf5,b'8/8/8/2Pbnk1p/1P5B/2K5/5P2/4R3 w - -',it didn't work.
650,22,54,4Bg3,b'8/8/8/2Pbnk1p/1P6/2K3B1/5P2/4R3 b - -',I still am attempting an exchange since I am up in pieces.  This time if RxN--then he will also lose the bishop on d5.  A strong move by white as least so it seemed.
651,22,55,4Nf3,b'8/8/8/2Pb1k1p/1P6/2K2nB1/5P2/4R3 w - -',until he moved his knight and threatened my rook.
652,22,56,Kg4,b'8/8/8/2Pb3p/1P4k1/2K1RnB1/5P2/8 w - -',double protection on the knight....the knight will play an important role in moving black's h pawn across.
653,22,57,4b5,b'8/8/8/1PPb3p/6k1/2K1RnB1/5P2/8 b - -',I am trying to get a queen as well....but his bishop stands in the way at d5.  I hope to move c6 and have protection so I can continue to cross.
654,22,58,h3,b'8/8/3B4/1PPb4/6k1/2K1Rn1p/5P2/8 w - -',he continues to proceed with his pawn....I plan to exchange with my bishop once he reaches h2.
655,22,59,5c6,b'8/8/2PB4/1P1b4/6k1/2K1Rn1p/5P2/8 b - -',I continue to move my pawn forward hoping to get a queen.
656,22,60,5h2,b'8/8/2PB4/1P1b4/6k1/2K1Rn2/5P1p/8 w - -',somewhere along the line I forgot that I was going to exchange...and made a really bad move! ):
657,22,61,5Rxf3,b'8/8/2PB4/1P1b4/6k1/2K2R2/5P1p/8 b - -',I tried to remove protection first and he got his queen!  And a 1 point lead.
658,22,62,5h1=Q,b'8/8/2PB4/1P1b4/6k1/2K2R2/5P2/7q w - -',I have to move the rook to escape his attack.
659,22,63,5Rg3+,b'8/8/2PB4/1P1b4/6k1/2K3R1/5P2/7q b - -',so I put him in check...double protecting my rook with a pawn and a bishop.  The goal here was to keep all my pieces protecting each other so that the queen can't pick them off.  This move put the king in check and did just that.
660,22,64,5c7,b'8/2P5/3B4/1P1b1k2/8/2K3R1/5P2/7q b - -',one more space--and I've got a queen too.
661,22,65,5Qc1+,b'8/2P5/3B4/1P1b1k2/8/2K3R1/5P2/2q5 w - -',Check!  He won't let me make it!
662,22,66,Qb1+,b'8/2P5/3B4/1P1b1k2/1K6/6R1/5P2/1q6 w - -',check again--black's best bet is to keep me in check hoping to pick off pieces...we can see both sides of this situation being played out--there are two specific goals in mind--mine is to defend my remaining pieces his is to attack and pick off my pieces.  May the best man win!
663,22,67,5Kc5,b'8/2P5/3B4/1PKb1k2/8/6R1/5P2/1q6 b - -',I'm trying to hide behind my pawns now...
664,22,68,5Bb7,b'8/1bP5/3B4/1PK2k2/8/6R1/5P2/1q6 w - -',he moves the bishop to prevent my pawn from crossing to the other side.  This is actually a good move....I'm stilted because I am out in the middle of the board....he can attack with the queen easily.
665,22,69,5Re3,b'8/1bP5/3B4/1PK2k2/8/4R3/5P2/1q6 b - -',this move made Re5 possible which would be check and give me a little more protection for my king....however my pawn on f2 is now weak.
666,22,70,5Qc2+,b'8/1bP5/3B4/1PK2k2/8/4R3/2q2P2/8 w - -',check......if I moved to b4--it would have been game....his bishop and queen are too powerful--the best bet is b6 (behind my pieces).  However I block off my pawn by doing so.
667,22,71,5Kb6,b'8/1bP5/1K1B4/1P3k2/8/4R3/2q2P2/8 b - -',I threaten his bishop.
668,22,72,5Bc8,b'2b5/2P5/1K1B4/1P3k2/8/4R3/2q2P2/8 w - -',he moves to block off my pawn--hopewell still has the upper hand.
669,22,73,5Re8,b'2b1R3/2P5/1K1B4/1P3k2/8/8/2q2P2/8 b - -',Re8!!!!!!!!!  This was one of my best moves in the game....he is either forced to loose the bishop or move it and allow me to queen my piece.  The best thing to do was probably Be6.  If I proceeded with my pawn in this case he would have had the c8 spot double protected.
670,22,74,5Qxf2+,b'2b1R3/2P5/1K1B4/1P3k2/8/8/5q2/8 w - -',who says I would have moved my pawn in that  case--probably would have moved the king to b7 first.  Anyway it doesn't matter because hopewell hopes that by putting me in check he can postpone or escape this dilemma.  He has noticed that my rook on e8 is no longer protected. Neither is the bishop on d6.
671,22,75,5Bc5,b'2b1R3/2P5/1K6/1PB2k2/8/8/5q2/8 b - -',Bc5!!!!!  Suddenly he is in trouble.  The queen is threatened as well as his bishop and he can't put me in check.  He is forced to move the queen and his bishop is mine.  I now have a 1 pt lead.
672,22,76,6Rxc8,b'2R5/2P5/1K6/1PB2k2/7q/8/8/8 b - -',and he has only a queen and king to play with.
673,22,77,6Qh6+,b'2R5/2P5/1K5q/1PB2k2/8/8/8/8 w - -',check...trying to split my pieces again.
674,22,78,6Kb7,b'2R5/1KP5/7q/1PB2k2/8/8/8/8 b - -',I hide behind my pawns--once again he is not able to check me....and I'm set for my next attack.
675,22,79,6Qe6,b'2R5/1KP5/4q3/1PB2k2/8/8/8/8 w - -',this seemed like a logical move....he needed to get closer.
676,22,80,6Rf8+,b'5R2/1KP5/4q3/1PB2k2/8/8/8/8 b - -',Rf8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This amazing move puts his king in check and allows me to move forward my pawn for a queen the next move!!!  This double-edged move gives the full advantage back to me.
677,22,81,6c8=Q,b'2Q2R2/1K6/4q1k1/1PB5/8/8/8/8 b - -',I know have a queen rock bishop--and a 9 pt lead!
678,22,82,6Qe4+,b'2Q2R2/1K6/6k1/1PB5/4q3/8/8/8 w - -',check...he tries to keep the queen in motion still hoping to pick off pieces.
679,22,83,6Qc6+,b'5R2/1K6/2Q3k1/1PB5/4q3/8/8/8 b - -',Qc6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Check and the queen if he chooses to move his king.  However if he chooses to take with the queen--he is not standing alone with his king...I still have a bishop rook and pawn.  He is in a very bad position....
680,22,84,6Kg5,b'5R2/1K6/2Q5/1PB3k1/4q3/8/8/8 w - -',he doesn't protect the queen.....the best move here would have been the exchange....I think he realizes whatever the case it is a lost cause.  The best he can hope for now is a draw.
681,22,85,6Qg2,b'5R2/1K6/8/1PB4k/8/8/6Q1/8 b - -',one move away from checkmate.  All good things must come to an end. And he resigns.

Black has played a typical Sicilian move preventing Nb5 after for example d4/...cxd4/Nxd4.  One problem is that White doesn't have to play d4 immediately (or at all!). Then Black's committal pawn move may prove awkward while White can transposition at his leisure.
684,23,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White is not concerned with a direct refutation of Black's opening which involves lines my opponent should know. It seems more practical to enter an open Sicilian and try to outplay Black on more familiar terrain.

Now White has many plans including the status quo Nc3 the ""anti-Sicilian"" c3 and c4 in the Maroczy bind spirit. That fact that many moves have been tired (successfully) here speaks to Black's opening choice. His dark squares are in critical condition (see d6 and b6) and he has yet too develop a piece in 3 moves. No doubt many White players past and present have attempted to refute this indulgence with various systems but in reality Black's Kan-type system will not fall apart so easily with accurate play from the second player."

In effect White is preparing to suffocate Black on the queenside while he struggles to develop and bring his king to safety. White is clearly better now.

The point of ...Nd7 should have been twofold: 1) hitting the e5 square in view of White's obvious f2-f4 ideas which after an exchange leave e5 as a powerful outpost; 2) threatening ...Nb6 to counter White's dream knight that will come to c4 soon. Even ..Ndf6 (after ..f7-f5 ideally) might be possible. The text simply wastes time...there is no point developing the bishop to b7 where it does nothing. Much better is ..Ne7 intending ..Ng6 to halt Whites f2-f4 plan.

The noose tightens as Black loses even more space and still has not castled. White is winning. Also possible was the typical Qe1 plan piling up on the kingside dark squares via Qg3/h4 and Bg5. Note how White can easily switch between queenside central and kingside plans with his massive space advantage while Black's pieces struggle to move along the last two files.

Always ask yourself what has changed after Black's last move and demand an answer says White hypocritically). In any case White's move demolishes the last defender of the Black king when he has calculated that Qf7  followed by Nxe5 leads to mate or heavy material gain.

While 9... hxg5 is the most common move in this position this move is reasonable if black is willing to sacrifice.  Black tries to get rid of the pin by getting the knight out of there when he has the chance however this puts the queen in the line of fire.

He's down material and must create as much pressure as possible either the lack of an f and g pawn gives him weaknesses OR he can use them as open files also his advanced pawns will be weak OR they can be used to attack with.  In this game he tries to activate but doesn't get enough.  Maybe black doesn't have enough for the rook?

Black feels that the knight is best going to b6 and then d5 or a4.  Ideally his knight would come to the kingside but that's slow.  He had an intriguing option in 20... Ne3?!! 21.fxe3 (21.Qe2 is fine for white but this is more exciting) 21... Rxg3  22.Kh1 (21.Kf2 is awful 21...Rxf3 simply wins and 21.hxg3 leads to a draw after 21... Qxg3  22.Kh1 Qh3 check and there is an unavoidable repetition) 22...Rh3 (he can't trade bishops yet and this keeps up threats) 23.Qe2 and I can't imagine he has enough.  The whole idea is that there's a lot of possible tactics here and while I think 20.g3 was reasonable it leaves my position with holes.

We had played that line a few times and this game I felt like trying something new.

Qb6 may be fine for black as it's difficult for me to use the fact that his queen's in the open 7... b4 is met by 8.Nb1 where the c4 pawn is quite ugly.

This is probably unsound but here's my justification for such a wild move.  a) look at his pawns they're really ugly.  They're advance or isolated and either way they're ripe for the picking.  b) I want to support my h pawn and f5 locked me out of the kingside with this move I bring my queen over to support it's advance.  c)  His king is in the middle of the board with no pawn protection and his pieces are undeveloped.

Here's a sample line that wasn't played: a) 17... Bxc3  18.bxc3 b4 (trying to break through 19.Bg2 bxc3 20.Qg8 ! Kd7 21.Be4! Rf7 22.h7 and white will queen.

Nd7 is killed by 19.axb5 where he simply can't take back and I threaten to take on c6.  19... axb5 20.Rxa8 Bxa8 21.Qg8 ! where I skewer the king and knight on b8.  If the queen blocks I get the h7 rook.
915,30,20,1Qg8+,b'rn2k1Q1/1b2q2r/p1p1p2P/1p6/PbpP4/2N3P1/1P3PB1/R3K2R b KQq -',I had some difficulty choosing between this and 19.axb5 with the following idea in mind (note how pressuring the move 7.a4 turned out to be!) axb5 20.Rxa8 Bxa8 21.Qg8 .  But then I saw 19... cxb5! (I though it was pinned at first) 20.Bxb7 Qxb7 21.Qg8  where I thought I won the h7 rook but his bishop can retreat!  Bishop retreats are the hardest one move tactic to see in chess.  21... Bf8 and my attack fizzles my rook is hit and 22.Qxe6 loses to 22... Re7 winning my queen.  So I chose this line.

I think it's amazing how completely tied down he was for the entire game.  If anyone has thoughts or corrections PM me.

1026,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This famous ecounter pitted the world champion Emauel Lasker against the sensational young Capablanca. Lasker proved that he wasn't yet ready to roll over and die before the next generation. Besides the historical significance of this game this match is noteworthy for Laskers simple winning startegy seemingly flowing right from the flowing. Simple for a master not for players like me! What this game lacks in brilliant combinations is more than made up Lasker's sheer elegance. At the end of the first half of this double-round tournament Capablanca stood a point and a half ahead of his nearest rivals Lasker and Tarrasch. When he met Lasker again in the seventh of the ten final rounds even a draw would virtually assure the Cuban of first place. But Lasker the great chess psychologist adopted an opening in which Black might indeed try for the advantage but could not readily obtain a draw. The result was a great victory over a great opponent.
1027,35,1,Nxd4,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',"A surprising choice in a ""must-win"" situation for the Exchange Variation is generally considered to allow Black equality. But the equality is of a dynamic nature as Black must use his two Bishops to counterbalance White's Kingside pawn majority and the sort play in which Capablanca excelled -- gradual simplification to a technical endgame -- will not do for each exchange of pieces brings White closer to a won King-and-pawn ending."
1028,35,2,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1nppp/p1pb4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Both sides have developed pieces and castled. Lasker has the edge in the centre: comsequently an advantage in space. He exploits this advantage by grabbing even more space on the kingside. He isn't opening himself up though. The players have already exchanged so much that the chances of a decisive attack seem almost impossible.
1029,35,3,f6,b'r1b1r1k1/1pp1n1pp/p1pb1p2/8/4PP2/1NN5/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',This gaurds the threat of 12.e5.

White accepts a permanently backward e-pawn and weakens the e5 square but he cramps the Black position and will obtain the e6 square for a Knight and the h2-b8 diagonal for his Bishop.
1031,35,5,1Bxd6,b'r3r1k1/1bp1n1pp/pppB1p2/5P2/4P3/1NN5/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Again a surprise decision undoubling Black's pawns. White has calculated that the Knight he will post at e6 will prevent Black from coordinating his pieces and the White Rooks will threaten to penetrate on both sides of the board.
1032,35,6,1cxd6,b'r3r1k1/1b2n1pp/pppp1p2/5P2/4P3/1NN5/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',This is a move that many people like me think of as a blunder that is why I am rated so low.  Lasker doesn't miond repairing Capa's damaged pawn structure becuase he has his sights set on the e6 square for his bus.
1033,35,7,Rd7,b'4r1k1/1b1rn1pp/ppppNp2/5P2/4P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Lasker has control over the centre and has slowed Capablanca's advance on the queenside: he now has improves his position of his king and seizes more space on the kinside.
1034,35,8,Nc8,b'2n1r1k1/1b1r2pp/ppppNp2/5P2/4P3/2N5/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Notice how how Capablanca's pieces are struggling to defend the d6 pawn without getting in each others way. This dilemna is often the consequence of having a spatial disadvantage.
1035,35,9,Ba8,b'b1n1r3/4rkpp/p1ppNp2/1p3P2/1P2P3/P1N5/2PR2PP/3R2K1 w - -',In hindsight Black should play here 21...Rxe6 22.fxe6  Kxe6 with a pawn for the Exchange and a solid position. But it is not easy to make such a decision in a seemingly tenable position.

1037,35,11,Nb6,b'b5r1/4rk2/1nppNp1p/1p3Pp1/1P2P1PP/2N2KR1/2P5/3R4 w - -',On 30...gxh4 31.Rh3 White recovers the pawn with advantage but now he must avoid 31.Rxd6 Nc4 32.Rd1 Ne5  33.Ke2 gxh4 and Black stands well with his centrally posted Knight.
1038,35,12,hxg5,b'b5r1/4rk2/1nppNp2/1p3Pp1/1P2P1P1/2N2KR1/2P5/3R4 w - -',Lasker has now opened the h-file and takes control of it with one of his rooks.
1039,35,13,Bb7,b'4k1r1/1b1r4/1nppNp2/1p3Pp1/1P2P1P1/2N3KR/2P5/7R w - -',Capablacnca hopes that his position is position is defendable and merely marks time but Lasker now takes the opportunity to bring his queenside knight into the game even at the cost of a pawn.
1040,35,14,3e5,b'4k1r1/1b1r4/1nppNp2/1p2PPp1/1P4P1/2N3KR/2P5/7R b - -',! A fine move capping White's strategic play with a tactical blow. Now the e5 square will be occupied by a Black pawn and White will use e4 as a pivot point for his Knight.
1041,35,15,Bc8,b'2b1k1r1/3r4/2p2p2/1pNnpPp1/1P2N1P1/6KR/2P5/7R w - -',Capablanca can't defend everything and decides to give up a rook for one of Laskers annoying knights. However Lasker retains his trump cards- the h-file and the spatial advantage-and now adds a slight material edge to the equation.
