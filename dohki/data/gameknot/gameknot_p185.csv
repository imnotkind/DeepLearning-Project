Also black had nothing to fear from the capture of the d5 pawn. 

In this case black can use the formula for knowing if a piece/space is under a serious threat of being captured. The formula is as follows

Simply ask 1. How many pieces do I have attacking the square 2. How many pieces does my opponent have defending the square. If the answer is you have more pieces attacking then you will win the exchange. 

For i.e
White has 2 pieces attacking d5 while...

Black has 2 pieces defending d5

Therefore after 5. ...Bg7 6. Cxd5? Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 black is equal and white gains very little from the exchange."

Understandably it is difficult to answer the question ""Do I capture with the knight or the bishop?"" When most of the pieces are on the board the answer is almost always with the knight! During the opening phase you use the knight to capture back toward the center. Bishops are usually long term assets that work best in the endgame. So trading them off in the opening is never a good plan. 

Think of it this way

KNIGHTS as short term assets that are more useful with lots of pawns and pieces on the board. So they are one of your strongest pieces early in the game. So use them early

BISHOPS are long term assets that increase in power the pawns and pieces are removed off the board. So just like fine wine your bishops get mature with age. So hold onto them!"

481,24,0,Bxe8,b'4b3/1pk5/p2p3p/8/8/3B3P/PP4P1/6K1 w - -',The point of this game is to give you some lessons in end game. if you want to improve your end game i suggest looking through this game and see how i won as white. I made a many mistakes in the opening and middle game but the end game is a place where i can win with my theories. How ever i am not a pro in end game so i could have missed some moves and if you see a better way for white to playplease comment because i'd love to learn new stuff as well.
482,24,1,2Kf2,b'4b3/1pk5/p2p3p/8/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 b - -',Kf2. The point of this move is to centralize the king. In the opening and middle game you want your king to be as protected as possible but in the end game the king is an important active attacker. The best thing to do with the king in the end game is to centralize it I.E. putting it as close to the center as possible. Having a centralized king can be the difference between a winning game and a loosing game. From the center the king can go fastest to any side of the board where action is taken and having the center makes it more difficult for black.
483,24,2,2d5,b'4b3/1pk5/p6p/3p4/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 w - -',a wrong move. I would suggest for black to compete in the centralization competition with Kc6. Now he basically gives up the center for my king.
484,24,3,3Ke3,b'4b3/1pk5/p6p/3p4/8/3BK2P/PP4P1/8 b - -',Moving further to the center
485,24,4,3Kd4,b'4b3/1p6/p2k3p/3p4/3K4/3B3P/PP4P1/8 b - -',Well this looks good for white. his king is more centralized than black's king and it is a strong blockader of the passed pawn on d5. Yesblockading a passed pawn could be considered passive but black will need to defend the passed pawn somehow and since it's isolatedhis king will also be passive.
486,24,5,3a5,b'4b3/1p6/3k3p/p2p4/3K4/3B3P/PP4P1/8 w - -',well the point of that move is just to move a piece away from the light squares you see now that i have a light squared bishop moving away everything from the light squares is good because now my bishop can't attack the piece that's why the passed pawn on d5 would be better of on d6 or d4.
487,24,6,3g4,b'4b3/1p6/3k3p/p2p4/3K2P1/3B3P/PP6/8 b - g3',g4. In the end game you'd want to get a passed pawn. Passed pawns are extremely dangerous in the end game and this is how white creates a passed pawn. after g4h4g5 black can choose to exchange the pawn or just play it to h4 but white will have a passed pawn after that. you see when you create a passed pawn you look on where you have more pawns then blackthen exchange and in the end you will have 1 passed pawn.
488,24,7,3b5,b'4b3/8/3k3p/pp1p4/3K2P1/3B3P/PP6/8 w - b6',well this is a wrong move now he focuses on just exchanging since he dont know that much theories but he is actually putting the pawn closer to my king which just makes it an easy taget
489,24,8,3a3,b'4b3/8/3k3p/pp1p4/3K2P1/P2B3P/1P6/8 b - -',not just for getting the pawn out of light squares but also when he plays b4 then 34. ab ab and the pawn will be closer to my king.
490,24,9,axb4,b'4b3/8/3k3p/3p4/1p1K2P1/3B3P/1P6/8 w - -',now no one will advance their pawn to keep them in dark squares. especially black because b3 gives up the square c3. 
491,24,10,3h4,b'4b3/8/3k3p/3p4/1p1K2PP/3B4/1P6/8 b - -',proceeding my plan to create a passed pawn
492,24,11,3Bd7,b'8/3b4/3k3p/3p4/1p1K2PP/3B4/1P6/8 w - -',My opponent isn't that experienced in end game theories so he decides to just attack the pawn but that isn't a good move white will just play g5 and the bishop will have to move back. so what should black instead play? well this game looks kinda lost for black now. white has the center and is about to get a passed pawn so maybe Bf7 would be a little better.
493,24,12,3hxg5,b'8/3b4/3k4/3p2P1/1p1K4/3B4/1P6/8 b - -',now white has a passed pawnthis passed pawn will win the game for white.
494,24,13,3Be6,b'8/8/3kb3/3p2P1/1p1K4/3B4/1P6/8 w - -',the point of this move is to be a strong blockader on g8
495,24,14,Bg8,b'6b1/8/3k2P1/3p4/1p1K4/3B4/1P6/8 w - -',for some this position looks like a draw but in this kind of position you need to ''scan'' the board. look on what your advantages are and use them to win. White's advantage in this position is that he has the center and black's pieces are very passiveking protects pawn on d5so does the bishop while blockading the passed pawn on g6. How ever the tricky part is how white should proceed. Well in this bishop ending game white should focus on taking advantage that he has a passed pawn and so...
496,24,15,3Bb5,b'6b1/8/3k2P1/1B1p4/1p1K4/8/1P6/8 b - -',Bb5!! Now white actually has a winning game and there's nothing black can do to stop it. The point of it is to move the bishop to f7  forcing black to take white's bishop and afterwardswhen white takes back with pawn the black king will have to rush down to stop the passed pawn and when he does that white can simply take blacks pawns and push his own pawn to b8 which is unstoppable. How ever you shouldn't play g7getting the pawn out of a light square in this position because then white wouldn't have any more attacking tactics and it would be a draw.
497,24,16,3Ke7,b'6b1/4k3/6P1/1B1p4/1p1K4/8/1P6/8 w - -',Ke7! in order to stop white from moving his bishop to e8 and f7.
498,24,17,4Kc5,b'6b1/4k3/6P1/1BKp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 b - -',How ever now he gave up the c5 square. now white can just take the b4 pawnd5 pawn and push his b pawn.
499,24,18,4Kf6,b'6b1/8/5kP1/1BKp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 w - -',quickest way to get rid of that passed pawn on g6 how ever now white can proceed with this move...
500,24,19,4Be8,b'4B1b1/8/5kP1/2Kp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 b - -',and now even someone who wouldn't know any end game theories could win in this position as white.

510,26,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So it's a Ruy Lopez.

I know some players who are as high rated as this guy who don't like to play black in this position because they feel like a target to white. But this position has been played by the best players in the world so it's nothing wrong with this position for black.

516,26,7,1g6,b'r1b2rk1/2q1bp1p/p2p1np1/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',this is a common way to play with black in this position: g6Re8Bf8Bg7.

But that would loose time. Howeverthen again i dont see any flaws with Ng3it's not a bad move.
519,26,10,1d5,b'r1b1rbk1/2q2p1p/p2p1np1/nppPp3/4P3/2P2NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Here i decided to push on with the pawn and block his Light squared bishop. I was thinking that to much pressure was on d4 since i was planning to ignore that pawn so pushing on lets me concentrate on other stufflike how to proceed a king side attack or something.
520,26,11,1Bd2,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2pbp/p2p1np1/nppPp3/4P3/2P2NNP/PPBB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',well as you see this move looses time...

522,26,13,1h6,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2pb1/pn1p1npp/1ppPp3/4P3/2P2NNP/PPBB1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',He probably knew that i was planning to move my queen behind my bishop and play Bh6 which could be dangerous for him.
523,26,14,1Qc1,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2pb1/pn1p1npp/1ppPp3/4P3/2P2NNP/PPBB1PP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',And i did it.

525,26,16,2Ne2,b'r1b1r3/2q2pbk/pn1p1npp/1ppPp3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBBNPP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',Herelike i said earlier i decided to withdraw my knightplay g4 and then play it back again to g3. it can be dangerous for black.
526,26,17,2Nc4,b'r1b1r3/2q2pbk/p2p1npp/1ppPp3/2n1P3/2P2N1P/PPBBNPP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - -',he moves back his knight. Now he wins my dark squared bishop. I didn't see that move coming and exchanging a rather passive knight for a potential dangerous dark squared bishop is a good thing i believe. Even tho black mostly plays something like Nbd7c4Nc5.
527,26,18,2Kh2,b'r1b1r3/2q2pbk/p2p1npp/1ppPp3/2n1P3/2P2N1P/PPBBNPPK/R1Q1R3 b - -',well i couldn't do anything about Nxd2 so i decided to prepare g4. if i play g4 immediately then h5 and the h3 pawn would be hanging.
528,26,19,Bd7,b'r3r3/2qb1pbk/p2p1npp/1ppPp3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBQNPPK/R3R3 w - -',This move connect his rooks.

532,26,23,2Qc8,b'r1q1r1n1/3b1pbk/p2p2pp/1ppPp3/4P1P1/2P2N1P/PPBQNP1K/R5R1 w - -',if I advance my g-pawn then he'll take my h-pawn.

534,26,25,2g5,b'r1q1r1n1/3b1pbk/p2p3p/1ppPp1p1/4P1P1/2P2N1P/PPBQNPRK/R7 w - -',stopping the g-pawn from advancing.

536,26,27,2h4,b'r1q1r1n1/3b2bk/p2p1p1p/1ppPp1p1/4P1PP/2P2N2/PPBQNPRK/6R1 b - -',I decided to exchange defenders it might be easier for a break through in this position.

I wasn't sure how to play here either because Ng3 would be met by Bxg4.That's why the pawn exchange i did was probably a bad one. Some people would prefer black in this position because of the f-file. However Now I decided to take action...
539,26,30,2Nh4+,b'r1q1r1n1/3b2b1/p2p2kp/1ppPp1p1/4P1PN/2P5/PPBQNPRK/6R1 b - -',This is a surprising move i made. I think black can defend himself against this knight sacrifice but not doing anything and just wait for black to take the f-file was not an option for me. I am very proud of this move and most of the moves black makes leads to a win for me. I kinda feel like grand masters who make sacrifices like this when i played this move.
540,26,31,3g5,b'r1q1r1n1/3b2b1/p2p2kp/1ppPp1P1/4P2p/2P5/PPBQNPRK/6R1 b - -',g5 advancing the pawn attacking the g-file. this is the point of the last move i made.

542,26,33,3f4,b'r1q1r1n1/3b2b1/p2p2k1/1ppPp1Pp/4PP1p/2P5/PPBQN1RK/6R1 b - f3',i have seen in attacks and learned to try to open as many files as possible. besides i looked at other moves and thought this was the best move to play.

On a more serious note this move is probably responsible for the lower statistical rating of 1. e4 as opposed to 1. d4. 
641,31,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So far I have a very good rating with this line the positions are much more dynamic than after 2...d6 and the initiative can shift much quicker to Black.

646,31,6,Nb8,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The best retreat. On e7 it would just tangle up pieces and it wouldn't have a good place to go.
647,31,7,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq c3',White has several plans in this position. The one played is the most popular but the others are just as playable. Other alternatives involve playing with a4 going for piece play rather than pawn attacks and in case Black plays a6 squeezing the Q-side with a5. Another plan is with f4 stabilizing and blocking Black's central pawns.
648,31,8,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The most elastic move. Black's plan is to castle and play f5 usually in that order.
649,31,9,1Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This signals that White isn't going for the f4 plan which would simply lose a tempo since an e4 pawn push would hit the Bd3 and instead wants to keep the lines open for his pieces and try to make use of the absence of a Knight on the K-side and attack there.
650,31,10,1a6,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black is well-advised to wait with this move since playing it at a wrong time can just create entry points on the dark squares on the Q-side. Since White has played such a brazen Bishop move I was more relaxed about his intentions.
651,31,11,1Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Pp3/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',There are some lines in which the Knight goes to a3 but that is connected to an early c5 push clearing c4 for the Knight pressurizing the Q-side.
652,31,12,f5,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3Ppp2/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - f6',The best plan for Black in these structures. White usually tries to go for a c5 push creating a passed d-pawn.

With White's pieces oriented on the K-side it's pretty hard to start active operations there without allowing the White pieces to come to life. Instead keeping a more flexible state of mind can make sure you don't misjudge the position and can find the most adequate plan.
662,31,22,1b3,b'r2q1rk1/1p1b2pp/p2p1b2/3Pnp2/2P1pB2/1PN4Q/P3BPPP/4RRK1 b - -',This seems like a mistake. White secures the c4 pawn at the expense of weakening the long diagonal.
