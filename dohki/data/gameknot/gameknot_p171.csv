0,0,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Both 1. ... e5 and 2. Nf3 have been the classical response.
1,0,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"A mistake by Black. White may take the pawn with 3. Nxe5 because retaking with 3. ... fxe5 would result in 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 or an attack after 4. ... Ke7 5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+ with the rest of White's pieces coming out over time.
2. ... d5 is the best move. There are quite a few other moves but in the end the only chance for Black after White plays 3. Nxe5 that does not lose instantly is 3. ... Qe7 but White has a big advantage after 4. Nf3 Qxe4+ 5. Be2 because of his huge lead in development.
"
2,0,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Perhaps it was White who made the bigger mistake.
3,0,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3pp3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Both players are pushing their pawns for control of the center. Ultimately though this is not the best move for Black. White can now play 4. dxe5.
4,0,4,Qxd8+,b'rnbQkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4P3/4p3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',A good move by White. Note that Black's king cannot castle after 5. ... Kxd8.
5,0,5,Bc4,b'rnbk1bnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4P3/2B1p3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',A blunder as White has left his knight on f3 open to capture by Black's pawn. However Black too fails to see it.
6,0,6,Be3,b'rnbk2nr/ppp1b1pp/5p2/4P3/2B1p3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',White again making no attempt to do anything about the knight.
7,0,7,exf6,b'rn1k2nr/ppp1b1pp/5P2/8/2B1p1b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',While it may appear to be a simple pawn exchange after 8. ... Bxf6 Black's kingside structure is not very strong.
8,0,8,Bxf3,b'rn1k2nr/ppp3pp/5b2/6B1/2B1p3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Both White and Black have been making very large mistakes here. Black now could have taken with the pawn. Perhaps White was simply employing what Robin Shaw coined as 'blufftics' and Black thought that there was a trap set for him in case he took with the pawn. In the end one can only look at the board and wonder what was going on.
9,0,9,1Bxf6+,b'rn1k2nr/ppp3pp/5B2/8/2B1p3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',If White had played 10. gxf3 Black could have captured the bishop on g5 and won a piece.
10,0,10,exf3,b'rn1k3r/ppp3pp/5n2/8/2B5/5p2/PPP2P1P/RN2K2R w KQ -',White is down a pawn but his bishop on c4 is very strong compared to Black's knight on f6. Note that both players have weak kingside structures.
11,0,11,1Nd2,b'rn1k3r/ppp3pp/5n2/8/2B5/5p2/PPPN1P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',White now prepares to slaughter the pawn on f3. Black can't defend it.
12,0,12,1Rhe1+,b'3r3r/ppp1k1pp/2n2n2/8/2B5/5N2/PPP2P1P/2KRR3 b - -',White's two rooks are now a very formidable fighting force down on the first rank with two open files before them.
13,0,13,1Bb5,b'3r1k1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/1B6/8/5N2/PPP2P1P/2KRR3 b - -',White is aiming to win the knight. If the pawn on b7 recaptures White can take the rook on d8 check the Black king and then win the second Black rook.
14,0,14,1Rxd1+,b'5k1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/1B6/8/5N2/PPP2P1P/2KrR3 w - -',Black is not so keen on such an eventuation.
15,0,15,Kh5,b'7r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/1B4Nk/7P/8/PPP2P2/2KR4 w - -',It may be a bit foolish of Black to be moving his king so much around the board seeing that White has the advantage and might encircle him with his very active pieces.
16,0,16,Ne5,b'7r/ppp3pp/5n2/1B2n1Nk/7P/8/PPP2P2/2K4R w - -',Note that by this time the area around the Black king is very tight and White takes advantage of that.
17,0,17,Kg6,b'7r/ppp3pp/5nk1/4n1N1/7P/8/PPP1BP2/2K4R w - -',Black could also move either knight to g4 to defend against the check.
18,0,18,2Bh5+,b'7r/ppN2kp1/7p/4n2B/4n2P/8/PPP2P2/2K3R1 b - -',A desperate move by White. He doesn't really seem to have a plan and goes for a simple check.
19,0,19,Nxf2,b'7r/ppN2k2/6pp/4n3/7P/8/PPP2n2/2KB2R1 w - -',A big mistake by Black. For now White can win his knight.
20,0,20,2Rf1,b'7r/ppN2k2/6pp/4n3/7P/8/PPP2n2/2KB1R2 b - -',The rook pins the knight to the king and just like with the pawn on f3 earlier Black is powerless to do anything about it.
21,0,21,Rxd2,b'8/ppN1k3/6pp/4n3/7P/8/PPPr4/2KB4 w - -',Black ignores the general principle that says you shouldn't trade pieces when you are down on material. It is especially important here as all Black has is a very weak knight on e5.
22,0,22,3Kd3,b'8/ppNk4/6pp/8/7P/3Kn3/PPP1B3/8 b - -',Not the best move by White. Black can now play 33. ... Ng2 and capture the pawn on h4.
23,0,23,gxf5,b'8/1p6/p2k4/5pKp/8/8/PPP1B3/8 w - -',White obviously is now winning as the two Black pawns next to the king will disappear shortly but he still has to promote a pawn as checkmating with just a king bishop and three pawns versus two pawns and the Black king could prove pretty tricky.
24,0,24,4Bf3,b'8/1p6/p2k4/5K2/7p/5B2/PPP5/8 b - -',For most of the succeeding moves White simply shows how powerful his bishop really is.
25,0,25,5c4,b'8/8/3K4/k7/2P5/pP6/P3B3/8 b - -',Black now has little hope. The best he can hope for is for White to blunder or a stalemate.
26,0,26,6Qh7#,b'7k/4K2Q/8/5B2/8/pP6/P7/8 b - -',A good display of creating a winning position this game probably would have been a lot shorter if White had originally played 3. Nxe5 but the whole adventure was aesthetically pleasing all the same. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game or want to leave me feedback please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.
27,1,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I thought this was intresting. I had never seen it before but I didn't doubt the skills of a 1350.
28,1,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',More common is Nf3
29,1,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is close to a stonewall position. After the tournament I studied this opening because It can work quite effectively
30,1,3,Be2,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1Pb1/4PN2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And he is already ready to castle
31,1,4,Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P1Pb1/2P1PN2/PP1BB1PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Somehow I could sense a strong kingside attack was coming soon. His pieces looked angled there
32,1,5,g6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2p1p/2nbpnp1/3p4/3P1Pb1/2P1PN2/PP1BB1PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',An opponent of mine was studying the game with me after the seccond round and questioned that move. I think the reason was it weakens the knight
33,1,6,Be1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2p1p/2nbpnp1/3p4/3P1Pb1/2P1PN2/PP2B1PP/RN1QBRK1 b - -',I knew after 8.Bd2 he would go to e1 then h4.
34,1,7,Qd7,b'r4rk1/pppq1p1p/2nbpnp1/3p4/3P1Pb1/2P1PN2/PP2B1PP/RN1QBRK1 w - -',I didn't want the pin on my knight so if bh4 I could play ne4 even though I end up playing be7 to get pieces on the kingside If he did a tradeoff.
35,1,8,Ne8,b'r3nrk1/pppqbp1p/2n1p1p1/3p4/3P1PbB/2P1PN2/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I was hoping for a trade off and also be able to replace my knight on g7

37,1,10,Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pppqbpnp/2n1p1p1/3p4/3P1P2/2P1Pb1P/PP1NBBP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I kinda trapped in my bishop so that's forced
38,1,11,1Bb5,b'r4rk1/pppqb1np/2n1p1p1/1B1p1p2/3P1P2/2P1PN1P/PP3BP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Commonly with the stonewall he wanted to play ne5 and that knight would be kind of irritating
39,1,12,1Bf6,b'r4rk1/pppq2np/2n1pbp1/1B1p1p2/3P1P2/2P1PN1P/PP3BP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Stopping the knight
40,1,13,h6,b'1r3rk1/ppp1q1n1/2n1p1pp/1B1p1pN1/3P1P2/2P1P2P/PP4P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',That was a mistake. Weakening the pawn on g6 but I just really want that knight out of there! But now he is just going to go on e5
41,1,14,Rf6,b'1r4k1/ppp1q1n1/2n1prpp/1B1p1p2/3P1P2/2P1PN1P/PP4P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',That was to avoid 21.bxc6 pxc6 22.ne5
42,1,15,2Rb1,b'1r4k1/ppp1q1n1/2n1prpp/1B1p1p2/3P1P2/2P1PN1P/PP4P1/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',A waste of time

44,1,17,Rb6,b'8/2p3nk/prpqprpp/3pNp2/Q2P1P2/2P1PR1P/PP4P1/1R4K1 w - -',"I dont really like the ""power pieces on the sixth rank"" thing so i'm trying to re organize my pieces "
45,1,18,2Qd1,b'8/2p3nk/prpqprpp/3pNp2/3P1P2/2P1PR1P/PP4P1/1R1Q2K1 b - -',?
46,1,19,2Rf8,b'5r2/2p3nk/prpqp1pp/3pNp2/3P1P2/2P1PR1P/PP4P1/1R1Q2K1 w - -',That was a bad move. After rg3 I would need to move back and wold lose some tempo.
47,1,20,Ne8,b'4nr2/2p4k/prpqp1pp/3pNp2/3P1P2/2P1PR1P/PP2Q1P1/1R4K1 w - -',That was for puting my rook on g8 to protect in a better spot.

49,1,22,Nf6,b'6r1/2p4k/prpqpnpp/3pNp2/3P1P2/2P1P1RP/PP3QP1/1R4K1 w - -',I saw my chance- ne4.

51,1,24,Rg7,b'8/2p3rk/prpqp1pp/3pNp2/3P1P1P/2P1P1Q1/PP4P1/1R4K1 w - -',I moved my rook there so c5 would be an option and I could break his stonewall
52,1,25,h5,b'8/2p3rk/prpqp1p1/3pNp1p/3P1P1P/2P1P2Q/PP4P1/1R4K1 w - -',That whole plan of his was good he was trying to break my king's defense or atleast make a hole in it.
53,1,26,c4,b'8/2p3rk/pr1qp1p1/3p1p1p/2pP1P1P/2P1PNQ1/PP4P1/1R4K1 w - -',I decided not to capture and to soon play c5... again. Don't you hate doubled pawns?
54,1,27,Qd8,b'3q4/2p3r1/pr2p1pk/3p1p1p/2pP1P1P/2P1PNQ1/PP4P1/1R4K1 w - -',I was down to about 10 minutes left on my clock and was thinking a trade off of queens would be nice to slim the game down to an endgame sooner
55,1,28,a4,b'3q4/2p3r1/1r2p1pk/3pNp1p/p1pP1P1P/P1P1P1Q1/1P4P1/1R4K1 w - -',Don't really know what that was all about accept for trying to play a3 with my pawn

57,1,30,4Rb5,b'3q4/2p3r1/4p1pk/1r1pNp1p/p1pP1P1P/P1P1P1Q1/1P4P1/1R5K w - -',Qb8 might have been better and then rb5. wrong move order

59,1,32,4Qb7,b'8/1q4rk/4p1p1/1r1pNp1p/p1pP1P1P/P1P3P1/1PQ5/1R4K1 w - -',better is Qb6

61,1,34,Qb6,b'8/6r1/1q2p1pk/1r1p1pNp/p1pP1P1P/P1P3P1/1PQ5/1R4K1 w - -',Qa6 is better by far. I was in deep trouble right now. Had only 6 minutes left. I was moving fast that's probably why I missed it.
62,1,35,Rxb2,b'8/6r1/1q2p1pk/3p1pNp/Q1pP1P1P/P1P3P1/1r6/1R4K1 w - -',49.rxb2 qxb2 50.nxe6 re7 51.ng5 re1# is a line that I was dreaming would happen

64,1,37,5Qxd1,b'8/6r1/1q2p1pk/3p1pNp/2pP1P1P/P1P3P1/8/3Q2K1 b - -',I was hoping for 3-move repetition sometime soon
65,1,38,5Qb3,b'8/6r1/4p1pk/3p1pNp/2pP1P1P/PqP3P1/8/3Q2K1 w - -',He was smart enough to not fall for that
66,1,39,Qc2,b'8/4r3/4p1pk/3p1p1p/2pP1P1P/2P2NPK/2q5/4Q3 w - -',I wanted to play qe4

68,1,41,5Qf6,b'r7/5N1k/4pQp1/3p1p1p/2pP1P1P/2P3PK/2q5/8 b - -',That is the mistake that threw the game for him. I was relieved.
69,1,42,5Qf2,b'r7/5N1k/4pQp1/3p1p1p/2pP1P1P/2P3PK/5q2/8 w - -',After that move we agreed to a draw. Ther was no way to stop the 3-move repetition. He could hold it off for a few moves or do it himself but it was game over. I was shakin' after that game. This was my first tournament game against an adult and I got a draw. Thank you for watching. Please leave comments. 
70,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',in this game white went into a won endgame but played a huge blunder in the very end.  But black resigned before trying to play out the position. This mistake was probably made by a miscalculation as you will see.
71,2,1,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',this is the so called 4 knights scotch. 
72,2,2,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I do not know any theory on this opening but this defense seems reasonable. White has no way to make any material gains.
73,2,3,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',acceptable. 
74,2,4,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I consider that this is a mistake. The better move was probably 6.Nxe4 but here white still wins the majority of games.
75,2,5,dxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',now black's position is much worse. The black knight has only 1 safe retreat and that is back to g8. Black is forced to play 6...Nxe4 as the game went or 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Nxe4 8.Qg4! winning material(8...Nxc3 9.Qc4).
76,2,6,Qg4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1b2n1Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',(!) this tricky move is best. Black has no way to prevent material losses. This transposes into the previous line I mentioned.
77,2,7,a3,b'r1bqkr2/ppp2pQp/8/3pP3/1b2n3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQq -',an interesting choice. I cannot analyze all the lines but this looks safe. 
78,2,8,c6,b'r1bqkr2/pp3pQp/2p5/3pP3/4n3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQq -',after this move white wins decisive material.
79,2,9,1Bh6,b'r1bqkr2/pp3pQp/2p4B/3pP3/4n3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQq -',the winning move.
80,2,10,1Qe7,b'r1b1kr2/pp2qpQp/2p4B/3pP3/4n3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQq -',this loses the exchange. White simply plays 12.Qxf8+ Qxf8 13.Bxf8 Kxf8
81,2,11,1Bd3,b'r1b1kr2/pp2qpQp/2p4B/3pP3/4n3/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R3K2R b KQq -',acceptable as the rook is not going anywhere soon.
82,2,12,Kxf8,b'r4k2/pp3p1p/2p5/3pPb2/4n3/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',white already has a decisive material advantage. He now uses the pin on the knight to win more material.
83,2,13,Rxe5,b'5k2/pp3p1p/2p5/3prb2/4P3/P1PB4/2P3PP/R3K2R w KQ -',black's position is hopeless here as he is a full rook down.
84,2,14,1Bxe4,b'5k2/pp3p1p/2p5/5r2/4B3/P1P5/2P3PP/R5K1 b - -',great use of transformation of advantages. White completely clears the smoke from the board and still maintains his huge material advantages. @nuntar: It is probably better to keep more material but I just like crystal clear positions.
85,2,15,a5,b'8/5p2/7k/p4B1P/1pp3Pr/8/2P1K3/1R6 w - -',black is trying to generate counterplay but white should still win.
86,2,16,cxb3,b'8/5p2/7k/p3KB1P/6P1/1pr5/8/1R6 w - -',generating counterplay. Black has 2 passed pawns down the queen side. Now white must really carefully.
87,2,17,4Re8,b'4R3/5p2/5K1k/p4B1P/6P1/8/1p6/2r5 b - -',threatening mate.
88,2,18,4Re6+,b'8/5K2/2r1R2k/5B1P/p5P1/8/1p6/8 b - -',transforming advantages again. The endgame is easily won for white.
89,2,19,4Bb1,b'8/8/4K2k/7P/6P1/p7/1p6/1B6 b - -',now the 2 black pawns are blockaded. The safest strategy is to directly march his king to the black pawns and win them. Both of white's pawn are indirectly defended(thanks nuntar).
90,2,20,4Kf7,b'7k/5K2/8/6PP/8/p7/1p6/1B6 b - -',(??) a blunder that throws the game away. However black actually resigned at this point. However I will continue the annotation to show that black can easily draw with his only legal move!
91,2,21,4a2,b'7k/5K2/8/6PP/8/8/pp6/1B6 w - -',the only legal move in the position. IT draws easily.
92,2,22,4g6,b'7k/5K2/6P1/7P/8/8/pp6/1B6 b - -',the only challenging continuation. 47.Bxa2 b1Q 48.Bxb1= In his analysis black must have thought that 46...a2 47.g6 axb1Q 48.g7+ Kh7 49.g8Q was hopeless. It is not at all.
93,2,23,4axb1=Q,b'7k/5K2/6P1/7P/8/8/1p6/1q6 w - -',the only move. 
94,2,24,Kh6,b'6Q1/5K2/7k/7P/8/8/1p6/1q6 w - -',Now we see the whole point. The black pawn queens and controls the g6 square and protects against mate. Black prematurely resigned in a drawn position. It never hurts to play on! In fact white is the one here who will be trying to draw.

The knight can't do anything even though black's position is too clumped the knight can only take the bishop which as we'll see doesn't do much good.

Even if white castles king side that pawn would be overextended because black cannot afford to do anything other than get the bishop and the queen out of the bank rank. Black has to castle queen side because a decent pawn push king side will tear his line apart and expose the king.

283,10,21,2Be4,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p7/2n2N2/2P1b3/8/P4PPP/1R2RBK1 w - -',Not the strongest of forks but it will get the job done.
284,10,22,2Rxe8+,b'r3R2k/1p3ppp/pR6/2nb4/2P5/8/P4PPP/5BK1 b - -',Move order here was critical. 
285,10,23,2cxd5,b'4r2k/1p3ppp/pR6/2nP4/8/8/P4PPP/5BK1 b - -',Passed pawn at last! (almost).
286,10,24,2Re1,b'7k/1p3ppp/pR6/2nP4/8/8/P4PPP/4rBK1 w - -',White must be frustrated by all these pins!
287,10,25,Rd1,b'7k/1p3ppp/pR6/2nP4/8/6P1/P4P1P/3r1BK1 w - -',A little pressure on the runaway pawn.
288,10,26,Kg8,b'6k1/1p3ppp/pR1P4/2n5/8/6P1/P4P1P/3r1BK1 w - -',Ever so wary of back-rank mates.
289,10,27,3Bxa6,b'5k2/1p3ppp/BR1P4/2n5/8/6P1/P4PKP/3r4 b - -',A desperate move. White expects  30. bxa6 Rb8#. However that was precisely the reason my Knight refused to make any moves for so long!
290,10,28,3Nxa6,b'5k2/1p3ppp/nR1P4/8/8/6P1/P4PKP/3r4 w - -',Any move loses for White.
291,11,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This open challenge turned into a tough battle. Although Alexkhine was 100 points south of my rating at the start it was pretty evenly matched. I made a few blunders however I got lucky at the end.
292,11,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I'm doing a little experimentation with the English opening at the moment to make a change from my more usual efforts
293,11,2,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Going for central control the disadvantage for white here is that only one peice is developed where as black is already able to castle
294,11,3,f3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm not entirely sure how sound this move is my intention was to prevent something like Bg4
295,11,4,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',supports e5 but blocks in the white lsb which doesn't move for the whole game

299,11,8,1Ng3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N2PN1/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',better late than never I guess

309,11,18,2Nf1,b'1rbq1rk1/5p2/pp1p2pb/2pPp2p/2P1PPn1/P1N2R2/1P1QB1PP/5NK1 b - -',This is a key move for me it frees some room for my rook and defends the h2 pawn

This move was partly so that my queen could look after the g pawn and the h pawn if I moved the g one. I am however also looking to get my queen out of the pin without compromising my defence. Note that the black queen is threatening both Qxh2 and Qf2 however at the moment I have enough defence on both h2 and f2. What I don't have much defence against is Bxf4
311,11,20,2f5,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2pb/2pPpp1p/2P1PPnq/P1N2R2/1P1Q2PP/3B1NK1 w - f6',Black is looking to open the f file for his rook and to push my rook away however with this move he also keeps his lsb out of any action. Bxf4 looks better

314,11,23,2Nxe4,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2pb/2pPp2p/2P1NPnq/P4R2/1PQ3PP/3B1NK1 b - -',threatening Nxd6 which combined with Qxg6 might allow me to make some threats of my own. Note that Qxe4 here would remove some of the defence of the pawns in front of my king It seems risky to do that unless I can make some direct threats at the same time
315,11,24,2Bxf4,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2p1/2pPp2p/2P1Nbnq/P4R2/1PQ3PP/3B1NK1 w - -',The pressure on my h pawn mounts further but what to do? I didn't like the look of Rh3 due to Qe1 threatening Be3+ I also didn't want to disturb my pawns too much with g3
316,11,25,2Neg3,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2p1/2pPp2p/2P2bnq/P4RN1/1PQ3PP/3B1NK1 b - -',In the end I decided on this for a number of reasons it reinforces my knight on f1 it restricts the black queen's movement and it opens a line for my queen to g6
317,11,26,2Bxg3,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2p1/2pPp2p/2P3nq/P4Rb1/1PQ3PP/3B1NK1 w - -',Although this move looks appealing it is a mistake as it has opened the f file for my rook. Blacks rooks are not linked as he hasn't moved his lsb this allows me to threaten mate
318,11,27,2Qxg6+,b'1rb2rk1/8/pp1p2Q1/2pPp2p/2P3nq/P4Rb1/1P4PP/3B1NK1 b - -',"Black resigned due to Kh1 Rxf8#.

My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is f7 for Black and f2 for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.

And I want to take the King away from the Queen when she is on f7. The Rook has a body guard from my Queen on b3 and I do not give Black time to castle any more because I will take the Queen. I no he will put his Queen on f7 because of my plan.

If black finds a way to exchange their two pawns to one white pawn it will be draw because endgame rook + bishot against rook almost alwais goes to draw. If blach looses both pawns but finds a way to exchange rooks it also will be draw because destination field of white pawn (a8) is of different color than the white bishop. So it will be a tricky task for white to win...
466,17,7,Rb5,b'5k2/2R5/8/1r6/pp3B2/3K4/P7/8 w - -',Excellent idea! It turns out that after 42.Kc4 black can play 42. ... b3!! and after 43.Kxb5 b2 white having one rook and one bishop more can't win! 44.Rc1 bxc1Q 45.Bxc1 Kd7 and white cannot take the a4 pawn and prevent black king to get into a8. Great endgame! It looks that there is no way for white to win :-(

Kg7? 44.Kc4 b3 45.Kxb5 b2 46.Be5+) The black pawn b4 looks unstoppable and white could try tosacrifice a bishop for it: 44.Bxb4 Rxb4 45.Kc3 Rh3 46.Rc4 Rxc4 47.Kxc4 in the hope that black king in h7 is to far. But analisis shows that it comes in time: 47. ... Kg7 48.Kb4 Kf7 49.Kxa4 Ke7 50.Kb5 Kd7 51.Kb6 Kc8 - a draw."

586,23,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move is a transposition into the Nimzowitsch Defence and serves a dual purpose.

There is no great need for White to capture the pawn although it would give the bishop good opportunities to attack the Black king later on. Note that if Black takes the d5 pawn with his own White can take with the bishop and will gain plenty of room to maneuver.

Things are looking good for Black but his extra bishop is useless along the c8-h3 diagonal as White has a strong pawn chain guarding half of it. Black's knight and two rooks are doing little at the moment whereas White's rook on d6 is menacing Black's neighbourhood. Black's king should be feeling a little stressed what with White's queen so close even if it threatens nothing at the moment while the White king is relaxing comfortably on the first rank.

Bxa6 White can take with the queen and end up with a queen knight and rook against a queen and two rooks but then White's king is in danger from Black's two rooks and the pair can move more freely now that Black's bishop is out of the way. 18. Rc6 is probably the best option.

622,23,37,Qxh4,b'4Q3/5pkp/6p1/4P3/7q/1KP5/8/8 w - -',Things now start to slip back into Black's favor. The problem for White is that his pawns are spread out whereas Black's pawns are untouchable thanks to his king.

Actually the first four or five moves of the Sicilian are so malleable and interchangeable each often leading to a known studied line that the order of these moves is secondary to the ideas.  This particular position is known as the Taimanov variation.  In this system black often hopes to place a bishop on b4 or c5.  Many interesting and complex positions can be reached from this position including a form of the Hedgehog the Maroczy Bind and the Kasparov gambit.
631,24,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A natural developing move but with a latent threat.  What would love to at some point get a knight to d6 which is arguably the most powerful square that he can sit on.  The permanent weaknesses incurred at d5 and d6 for black have to be dealt with and much time and effort has been spent finding the best methods for which he can do so.  One drawback of the Taimanov variation is by moving the e-pawn black has created a permanent hole at d6.  White would do well to try to exploit it.  A knight on c3 is a mere two moves away from the lethal square and of course many other factors will have to be in place if the white player hopes to properly use the square to its devastating potential but the lack of pawn protection leaves the idea permanently in both players minds.

The weaknesses incurred at f3 and especially f4 are believed to be not life threatening with proper play.  But as we’ll see Polgar was able to exploit the weakness.  If a player of Shirov’s strength is unable to defend the weaknesses perhaps the move itself should be considered suspect.  It hardly speaks well of the line if your only hope is that your opponent misplays.

The b5 square is inherently weakened due to black’s first move and a6 seeks to both defend it and prepare b7-b5 as this often makes white’s knights uncomfortable.  Black must be careful not to over extend here but a7-a6 can hardly be considered doing so.  The prophylactic nature of the move combined with its subtle power make it a common choice at the Grandmaster level.

Nf6 is all well and good it develops it helps clear the way for a KS castle and it attacks the g-pawn but it allows the following line: [9.

The f4 weakness has been successfully nullified and the KS pawns are storming.  Perhaps this is what Shirov had in mind with his 6th move?  Oh to be able to calculate like that over the board…)] .  Nge7 accomplishes nearly the same thing as Nf6 but without conceding a tempo when white plays g6.  Also the move contests f5 which is going to be black’s key breakthrough.

Although one can argue that reacting to a move that hasn’t happened yet gives your opponent the upper hand I don’t believe that is the case here.  Shirov probably reasons b7-b5 is going to happen regardless so taking a turn to move the knight will also have to happen and whether it happens on move 9 or move 10 is irrelevant.

639,24,10,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/4nppp/p1npp3/1p6/4PPP1/1NN1B3/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',Shirov thrusts forward and creates an intimidating looking pawn wall but as is often the case with pawn moves their committal nature comes back to haunt them.  The f4 thrust fatally weakened g4.  Now rather than having a dominating pawn wall along e4-f4-g4 white has a debilitating weakness along the squares e3-f3-g3 and also the weakness extends to e4 and f4 which can no longer be defended by pawns.

Polgar sacrifices a pawn but in return she nullifies the strongest point in white’s position.   The queen who had been shielded behind the pawn wall is now uncomfortably open.  White is now forced to put his attacking plans on hold as he cleans up the mess that has ensued.
643,24,14,1fxg5,b'r2qkb1r/1b2np1p/p1npp3/1p4P1/4P1P1/1NN1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Shirov has little choice but to accept the sacrifice as after 12 f5 Ne5 black has permanent control of f4 and e5.  The counter-attacking 12. e5 is a slightly more edible but still leaves the ugly holes across d4 e4 and f4 as well as an isolated e-pawn after the captures.  Shirov’s best chance was to ignore the threat with O-O-O and start a more strategic counter attack putting pressure on the e-file.  It would be hard to do so when so much time and material are invested on the KS to simply ignore it.

On the surface it may seem like it takes time out of her attack for a seemingly pointless move.  The knight can easily be moved and most of the energy has been focused on the KS at this point but it’s where the knight has to move to that Polgar is interested in.
647,24,18,1Ne2,b'r2qkb1r/1b3p1p/p1npp3/5nP1/1p2P1P1/1N2B3/PPP1N1QP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Shirov is forced to move the knight and feels that it’s better to add to the defenders on the KS.  Na4 gets the knight out of danger but a4 is a wretched square for him.  Nb1 is not as bad but it cuts the rook off from the fight.  The drawback of Ne2 is that it constricts the king as we’ll see in a few moves

The queen is untouchable because of 17. Qxg5 Nf3#.   This type of mate is virtually never seen so it's quite impressive that Polgar was able to create one.  Also the knight attacks f2 and it will fork the king and rook if it gets there.  For Shirov it's a case of losing his queen his rook or being mated.  Not a comfortable position for anyone to be in.

677,25,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So 1. e4 c5 marks the Sicilian Defense a very tactical defense filled with potential for both sides.
678,25,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',So Ajay as you mentioned in one of your comments (now deleted due to comments posted afterward) you noticed on the openings website I sent you to that the bishop is seldom brought out early in the Sicilian and when it is the results are not good for White. Here's why: In this early stage in the opening you don't know what squares will be best for the bishops and you know the knights are best on c3 & f3. The best squares for the bishops is determined by the pawn structure and the other pieces (especially pawns). So it is best to move the knights out and see what develops in the pawns and pieces before moving the bishops. It turns out this was not the best square for the bishop. The consequences are evidenced in 2 ways: 1. I forced you to move the bishop a 2nd time gaining development for me and losing it for you. 2. More important after your later Qe2 the bishop had very little space to move to so I cornered and slayed him (poor guy).
679,25,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is the Sicilian Anderssen Variation.

682,25,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',"(?) Although this move looks perfectly natural I consider it to be a question mark move due to the reasons stated in my next move.

The note above was previously input but on reviewing again I see you had no better choice here since 7. Bb3 c4 8. Ba4+ Kf8 leads to the same line we played."
683,25,7,Kf8,b'rnbq1k1r/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',"(!?) So conventional chess theory would say ""Block the check with the bishop or knight. Don't relinquish the right and privilege of being able to castle."" I've never been one to hold to conventional theory. I am an innovator always seeking out new ideas. In our previous game* I stated ""Every principle has some exceptions"". I gave the example of a natural man made law - to stop at a red light - which most people would violate if given the right circumstance. I made an imaginary scenario of you having an injured loved one in critical condition. There is no ambulance in your town so you have to drive half an hour to the hospital. You may go through a red light or two. Similarly chess principles are guidelines only - they should not be adhered to dogmatically. 

Ajay you may remember I took several days to make this move as I suggested to you at the beginning ""Analyze Analyze Analyze!"". So here are my thoughts that brought about this strange move: 

I. The bishop on b5 is restricted. The only square he can go to which ""seems"" safe is a4. I say seems because as we see it is really deadly for the bishop. Moving to d3 is not safe as 8. ... c4 traps the bishop. 

II. If I block the check with a knight or Bishop then when I harass the bishop you can get him out of trouble by trading.

III. I can trap the bishop via:

A. 8. ... a6 followed by 9. ... b5 and 10. c4.
B. If 8. a3 a6 9. Ba4 c4 still traps him. This is the line that was played.

IV. Although White gets the 1st move in this position he only has 4 development moves while black has 5 development moves. So Ajay do you know how to count development moves? If not send me a note to say you need more info and I will explain. Until then suffice to say that Black is ahead in development while white has some compensation due to the Black king's position. I was planning on manually castling via g6 ... Kg7 ... Re8. On one hand. manually castling loses development because instead of 1 move to castle it takes 4 moves on king-side castling (2 moves for the king 1 pawn push and the rook move). On the other hand I was already ahead in development and I was planning on forcing you to lose more development. (See point IV below.) So I felt manually castling was justified. I also had the prospect of winning your bishop (not yet forced). As it turned out I never did manually castle. I always saw a stronger move.

V. White can move his queen to make space for the bishop. Then if 8. ... a6 9. Be2 (9. Bf1? would further impede his development). If he moves his queen the queen only has 3 safe squares to go to: d1 f1 & e5 (8. Qe3? d4 forking the queen and knight).

A. If 8. Qd1 a6 9. Be2 you would be even further behind in development. You would only have 3 development moves while Black has 5 plus it's Black's move making it 6. 

B. If 8. Qf1 a6 9. Be2 you are even further behind than example A since your queen blocks you from Kingside castling.

C. If 8. Qe5 (See comment below)"
684,25,8,a3,b'rnbq1k1r/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/P1N2N2/1PPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"(?) You might have expected 8. ... a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 c4 11. Ba2. While not winning the bishop this would have seriously impeded your LSB. Yet the line I played was stronger: 8. a6 9. Ba4 c4 the move you stated was a surprise! It's important in chess to look at what I call ""crazy moves"". It's the moves that are ridiculously outlandish that are frequently the best! For example in this game: 7. ...Kf8! & 9. ... c4! (especially Kf8).

For more on ""crazy moves"" study the games of masters such as Bobby Fischer and José Raúl Capablanca. To make some of the moves they made they definitely would have seemed insane. But the analysis that followed proved they were solid moves."

1000,36,32,Bd4,b'5rk1/7p/p2P4/2p5/2Pb1pP1/7P/P4p2/1K3R2 w - -',this is crushing for black. White resigns.

1010,38,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',My opponent responds with e5 a move with the same purpose as white's first.

1012,38,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black accepts. Other moves included d6 and Bc4.
1013,38,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The main follow up for white. It develops a piece prevents Qh4+ and protects some central squares.
1014,38,5,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',!? This is new to me. It attacks my currently unprotected e4 pawn and it allows to develop the light squared bishop. This is called the Abbazia defense.
1015,38,6,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I take his pawn.

1017,38,8,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3q4/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I develop my queenside knight while gaining a tempi on his queen.
1018,38,9,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/q7/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The best square for the queen. It can't be attacked soon and it doesn't hinder black's developpement. The idea is similar to the scandinavian defense. (1. e4 d5!? 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5)
1019,38,10,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/q7/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',Logical. It frees my dark squared bishop and controls some important central squares. It also pins my own knight to the king though.

It also prepare kingside castling. My b2 pawn is somewhat poisonous after 8. Bc4 Qxb2?! 9. Rb1 Qa3. (The black queen is misplaced)
1024,38,15,Bg4,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/1q1b4/8/2BP1pb1/2N2N2/PPPB2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',"?! Although this move seems good it is not. GK thinks this is a mistake. It pins my knight which could be annoying. However some pins can be converted into discovered attack...

1064,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Today I finished my first GK game and would like to annotate this. The game was not too exciting but there were some instructive points. My opponent starts out e4.
1065,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I play the sicilian defence a solid line that gives black plenty of chances for advantage. Against this line I employ the Grand Prix Attack. 
1066,39,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',white is probably going for an open sicilian.
1067,39,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I play Nc6. The other 2 main moves here are d6 and e6. 
1068,39,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',white does go for the open sicilian. It is a very dynamic and sharp game.
1069,39,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I play the accelerated fianchetto. This dragon variation is a lot like the traditional one but black has not played d6 yet and should wait until it is necessary to play d6 to keep the game in the accelerated territory.
1070,39,6,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',"this move is to be prefered over d6 as the pawn move is ""inflexible"" as the game shows."
1071,39,7,Be2,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',white plays the classical variation. the other line is to play the yugoslav attack. 
1072,39,8,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - d6',exclam(!). this is the reason why d6 was not played earlier. Most dragon players know that black's key move in the non maroczy variations is the freeing d5. In the traditional dragon the d pawn takes 2 moves to reach d5 but in accelerated territory the pawn move is accomplished in 1 thus saving an entire tempo and here I think black has a small edge. And the statistics for master games shows that black scores a very nice 59%
1073,39,9,Nxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2N2np1/3p4/4P3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',one critical line.
