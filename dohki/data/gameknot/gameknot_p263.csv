1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',King pawn! YESSSSS.
2,0,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Game over I win. (He did not resign his time ran out.)
3,1,0,d5,b'rnbqk2r/p2pbpp1/1pp1pn1p/3P4/2P5/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I wanted to make this move earlier but felt that I should develop properly instead. Now that the opportunity remained I took it. I don't know whether this is strong though.
4,1,1,a5,b'rn1qk2r/1b1pbpp1/5n1p/pp1N4/8/1B2PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq a6',I have had troubles with the pawnstorms on the queenside in previous games with him. Overall our games (where I'm white) tend to be the same: I get the initiative have a good play on the centre and kingside but his pawns on the queenside give me troubles towards the end. I pressure him hard but use too much time thinking and end in a time trouble where I blunder and lose the game. This game follows the pattern to some extent.
5,1,2,Ra6,b'1n1q1rk1/1b1pbpp1/r4n1p/1p1N4/p7/P3PN2/BP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',A weird move. I think natural Nc6 or maybe taking to d5 was expected. Of course now black threatens Re6 after 15.Ne5 Re6 16.Nxf6  Rxf6 -/  (maybe)
6,1,3,d6,b'1n1q1rk1/1b2bpp1/r2p1n1p/1p1NN3/p7/P3P3/BP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Another weird move. Blocks the dark bishop and the a-rook which now look rather silly in a6.
7,1,4,1Nxe7+,b'3qr1k1/1b1nNpp1/r2p1n1p/1p6/pP6/P3PN2/B4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',!? I think now my dark bishop has good prospects to aim at black's king but of course it is a dubious idea to exchange a strong knight to a passive bishop but I feared it would come to a1-h8 diagonal and challenge my bishop.
8,1,5,Ne5,b'4r1k1/1b3pp1/r2p1n1p/1p2n3/pP1Qq3/P3PN2/BB3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Here Qg6 would've been very strong I think. Now I have chance to liquidate.
9,1,6,dxe5,b'4r1k1/5pp1/r4n1p/1p2p3/pP2b3/P3P3/BB3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black get's rid of his weakness on d6 but I did't like black's ideas to come c4 with his knight plus I get my rooks quicker to open lines than he does.
10,1,7,Be6,b'4r1k1/5pp1/r3bn1p/1p2p3/pP6/P3P3/BB3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',Very good. Now I must give up the bishop pair or retreat.
11,1,8,Kf7,b'2r5/4nkp1/3R3p/1p3p2/pPbBpP2/P3P3/5KPP/1B6 w - -',I think 36.- Ba2!! would have been very strong. 36.- Ba2 37.Bxa2 Rc2  But I haven't analysed this game at all other than during the game so I don't really know.
12,1,9,3g4,b'2r5/4nkp1/3R3p/1p3p2/pPbBpPP1/P3P3/5K1P/1B6 b - g3',This was stupid objectively. Black still has Ba2!
13,1,10,3gxf5,b'8/5kp1/2n4p/1p3P2/pPbBpP2/P3P3/5K1P/1B6 b - -',Now things look much better.
14,1,11,3Bd3,b'8/5kp1/2n4p/1p3P2/pP1BpP2/P2bP3/5K1P/1B6 w - -',A blunder Bd5 would be safer.
15,1,12,4f5,b'8/1n6/7p/1P1k1P2/pBp1p3/P1K1P3/7P/8 b - -',I think h3 would have been better and more straighforward way to win. Black would be in zugzwang. But this wins also.
16,1,13,6Qe5,b'8/8/2K1n3/4Q2p/p3p1k1/P7/3B3P/8 b - -',I had only 2 or 3 minutes left and my opponent had 20. Very typical in our games but this time I'm just plain winning.
17,1,14,6Bg3,b'3n4/8/8/3K3p/p7/P5B1/5Q1P/7k b - -',And so I took my hat trick. Winning the championship again. 2006 2007 and 2008 =)

34,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Una bella partita fino allo sbaglio stupidissimo e fatale. Comunque sono orgoglioso del sacrificio di torre.

39,4,5,Nxe5,b'5rk1/1b2qppp/p1r1pn2/1pPpn3/3P1B2/1PQ4P/P3BPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',"Prendo di alfiere o di pedone? Non lo so... di pedone ha qualcosa di tattico forse. Se dopo d4xe5 la torre prende c5 exf6 e si pu� andare avanti con lo scambio di donne. Se il cavallo f6 muove d7 c'� comunque la minaccia alfiere d6... se prende di donna si scambiano le donne e poi prendo il cavallo f6 quindi niente per il nero.
Ma se il cavallo f6 si ritira in d7 subito dopo d4xe5 le bianche hanno il tempo che gli serve per fare b3-b4 e il gioco � incerto per la colonna d aperta al pedone nero che oltretutto se riuscisse ad avanzare (e potrebbe anche essere sacrificato) libererebbe l'alfiere b7 la cui chiusura � il principale vantaggio delle bianche. 
Alla fine per� non ho preso di pedone nonostante sia tematica per me perch� comunque � sempre pi� sicuro non aprire la diagonale all'alfiere b7. E c'� sempre Ad6...
Beh dopo 22.g3 e4xg3 c'� tutto un mondo. Sia se si cambia l'alfiere sia se si mette subito la torre in g1 e... tattica! alla grande. Ci sono duecento trappole per il nero... ma la situazione � delicata per le biache. Fantastico. Da analizzare."

Sacrifico volentieri il pedone g pur di avere la colonna libera per l'attacco sul re nero. Anche se questo mette in pericolo diretto il mio re. Qui ho calcolato e direi che � stata una scommessa mica male (soprattutto perch� poi � andata bene)."

La debolezza di f3 inchioda l'alfiere e2 e ho provato parecchie varianti sacrificando f3 per vedere se poi la pressione dell'alfiere bianco sostenuto dalla donna su f5 servisse a qualcosa. E mi � sembrato di no.
Allora ho detto calma che comunque anche le nere non hanno grandi possibilit� di attacco."

However there is a dual purpose in this.

Rb7 - I have vague ideas of a king hunt if my opponent is careless enough to take the a3 pawn as if one of the rooks leaves the second rank then I will push up the g pawn to g5 delivering a check to draw the king out to open country but black's next move is a killer.

The only way I can move my Knight now is if I move my Queen first right?  While pins can be broken by 1) forcing your opponent to move the piece giving the pin or 2) moving the pinned piece they can also be broken by attacking a move valuable piece that the one your opponent has pinned your piece to.  Unfortunately with the Queen being the most powerful piece on the board there's nothing greater to counterattack... or IS there?
96,6,16,1Bxf2+,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/2np1n2/6B1/Q3P3/2P5/PP1N1bPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',White now has two options:  To move the King out of check or to take the Bishop with his King.

98,6,18,1Ng4+,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/2np4/6B1/Q3P1n1/2P5/PP1N1KPP/R4B1R w - -',Note that even though Black has moved the pinned Knight exposing his precious Queen White is POWERLESS TO TAKE IT because he MUST answer to the Check on his King!
99,6,19,1Kg1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/2np4/6B1/Q3P1n1/2P5/PP1N2PP/R4BKR b - -',White decides to hide his King safely on his first rank surrounded by four of his pieces for protection.  Now the pinned Queen becomes the attacker 
100,6,20,1Qxg5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/2np4/6q1/Q3P1n1/2P5/PP1N2PP/R4BKR w - -',... taking White's unprotected Bishop regaining a  2 advantage and attacking White's Knight at d2 at the same time.  What White does next invariably costs him the game:
101,6,21,1Nc4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/2np4/6q1/Q1N1P1n1/2P5/PP4PP/R4BKR b - -',?  Why didn't he move Nf3?  I don't know but I have the answer:
102,6,22,1Qc5+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/2np4/2q5/Q1N1P1n1/2P5/PP4PP/R4BKR w - -',"Although White's King is surrounded on four sides by his pieces there is still an open diagonal for Black's Queen to give check.  Tragically for White it can only be protected by his Knight if he moves it to e3.  After Qxe3# the game is over so White resigns here.

While I was fortunate to checkmate my opponent (there were several King moves that may have given his King more mobility) the lesson to be learned here is to answer a powerful move from your opponent with an even MORE powerful reply.  In this case two successive checks not only broke the pin on Black's Knight but it also unleashed the power of Black's Queen to join in the attack on White's exposed King.

Always try to castle early to avoid this type of predicament.  An exposed King has cost me many a game so learn from your mistakes and try not to make the same ones again!

2. It doesn't control anything new. The Queen already controlled all of the squares the Bishop is attacking. It's even worse that there's nothing to be gained by reinforcing that diagonal.
3. It blocks the Queen.
4. It would be better on g2 where it would add support to d5.
5. It breaks the basic rule (that is very important right now) to develop Knights before Bishops.
6. It wastes a perfectly good tempo that could be used to do something productive."

183,11,10,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/2PnP3/2NPBN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White seems to have the idea now. He's applying all the pressure he can to d4.

185,11,12,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2PnP1n1/2NPBN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"This leaves Black with an interesting choice: Does he keep building pressure in the center or does he trade it all off?
Black decides that it looks better to leave White with a huge pawn island in the center that will provide lots of targets."

Now we can see that the pawns on c3 and e3 are going to be weak and that the Knight will be much worse than the Bishop in two or three moves. If Black can rally attacks around those target points then he should be able to win at least a pawn.
187,11,14,1d6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2P1P3/2PPPN2/P3Q1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black unblocks his poor Bishop.

A. He can leave the pawn and allow White to open up the d-file to place his Rooks there before Black is done developing.
OR
B. He can capture the pawn and fix one of White's weaknesses and then exploit the other."

190,11,17,1exd4,b'r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2N2/P3Q1PP/R4RK1 b kq -',I think it would have been better for White to take with the pawn on c3 because the pawn on e3 is harder for Black to get at. It only takes one move for the Black Queen to attack c3 and she attacks a2 at the same time.
191,11,18,1Bg4,b'r2qk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP1b1/2P2N2/P3Q1PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black makes the White Knight useless.
192,11,19,1Qf2,b'r2qk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP1b1/2P2N2/P4QPP/R4RK1 b kq -',White immediately breaks the pin.
193,11,20,1Bxf3,b'r2qk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2b2/P4QPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Now that the pin is broken Black figures that his game will be easier if he trades pieces.
194,11,21,1Qxf3,b'r2qk2r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2Q2/P5PP/R4RK1 b kq -',Black must defend f7 or lose the pawn and allow White to invade so he castles.
195,11,22,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2Q2/P5PP/R4RK1 w - -',This protects the King and the pawn and allows the Rook flexibility to join the fray as is pleases. Black's main idea now is to attack the doubled pawns on the c-file and then dominate the c-file.
196,11,23,1Rab1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2Q2/P5PP/1R3RK1 b - -',White puts his Rook on a good square. It attacks Black's pawn on b7 and therefore develops with tempo. It also allows the Rook some flexibility to defend the pawn on c4.
197,11,24,1b6,b'r2q1rk1/p3pp1p/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P2Q2/P5PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Unfortunately Black has to block his Queen's access to a5 which makes her a very depressed piece there on the back rank.
198,11,25,1Qg3,b'r2q1rk1/p3pp1p/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P3Q1/P5PP/1R3RK1 b - -',This move feels a little pointless to me except that it clears the way for Rf4 and then Rh4 which are a major part of White's attacking idea. 
199,11,26,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/p3pp1p/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2P3Q1/P5PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Black's attack begins.
200,11,27,1Rb4,b'2rq1rk1/p3pp1p/1p1p2p1/8/1RPPP3/2P3Q1/P5PP/5RK1 b - -',White defends his pawn valiantly.
201,11,28,1a5,b'2rq1rk1/4pp1p/1p1p2p1/p7/1RPPP3/2P3Q1/P5PP/5RK1 w - a6',Black wants to chase the Rook to a4 where his Queen can attack it with tempo.

203,11,30,1Qc7,b'2r2rk1/2q1pp1p/1p1p2p1/pR6/2PPP3/2P3Q1/P5PP/5RK1 w - -',Black decides to add some more pressure since he has time.

206,11,33,2Kh8,b'2r2r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2p1/p6R/2qPPR2/2P3Q1/P5PP/6K1 w - -',I think that 21. ...Qxc3 was better because it basically ruins White's whole attack.
207,11,34,2Qh4,b'2r2r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/3PPR1Q/2q5/P5PP/6K1 b - -',This couldn't have happened with the Rook still on h5 (thus Black should not have moved the King but rather he should have taken the pawn first). Luckily Black has a tactical idea that wins (and even if it didn't it would allow him to defend).
208,11,35,2Kf1,b'2r2r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/3qPR1Q/8/P5PP/5K2 b - -',If 24. Kh1 Rc1 .
209,11,36,2Rc1+,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/3qPR1Q/8/P5PP/2r2K2 w - -',Black is very lucky that this tactic arrived on the scene because without it he would have had to defend against the attack on the h-file.
210,11,37,2Ke2,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/3qPR1Q/8/P3K1PP/2r5 b - -',White's lack of defense is becoming readily apparent. That's his only move.
211,11,38,2Qb2+,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/4PR1Q/8/Pq2K1PP/2r5 w - -',Now if 26. Kd3 Rc3  27. Kd4 Qb4  28. Kd5 Rc5# or 26. Ke3 Rc3  27. Kd4 Qb4  28. Kd5 Rc5#
212,11,39,2Kf3,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/4PR1Q/5K2/Pq4PP/2r5 b - -',Again this is White's only move (his other two options lose by force).

214,11,41,2Kg4,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/4PRKQ/2r5/Pq4PP/8 b - -',White's King has finally found some comrades to defend him.
215,11,42,2Qxg2+,b'5r1k/4pp1p/1p1p2pR/p7/4PRKQ/2r5/P5qP/8 w - -',"Black delivers the crushing blow.
The only way White can defend is to sacrifice his Queen and so he resigned.
This was an exciting game all the way through. Even though it started very closed and positional the end of the game was completely driven by tactics.
White had a major attack and Black's win ended up coming from a freak tactical sequence. This was a beautiful ending.

254,13,2,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Here White has played a small inaccuracy. The proper move is 5. Ng3 which attacks the Bishop and ensures that Black can't powerfully establish his Bishop on f5 with e6. 
255,13,3,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black's Bishops are now ready to criss-cross White's position with pins. White should seriously consider playing a3 to cut down Black's dark-squared Bishop's scope.
256,13,4,Bb4,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',There's the first pin.

It's not going to lead any mating attacks right away but it controls the center and allows Black to play ...c5 or ...e5 later. Coupled with a Knight on f6 Black has a strong grip on the center.
258,13,6,Bc4,b'r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/5b2/1bBP4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',A truly pathetic move for the Bishop. All this does is clear the way for White to castle. So far Black is doing a good job of nurturing his advantage into something larger. Black is slowly placing a stranglehold on the center and leaving White cramped. Black can play ...b5 whenever he wants or even Nb6 which adds support to the future idea of blockading the d-pawn.
259,13,7,a3,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/1bBP4/P1N2N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White needs to gain space and get rid of the pin. If he waits around much longer Black will start taking aim at his favorite targets and White will have to keep making less than satisfactory moves like Bc4.

This way Black keeps tension in the center and can continue to nurture his small advantage (at 9. a3 Fritz estimates Black's advantage as about 1/10 of a pawn but after ...Bxc3 at 0).

I feel that white was better after my not so hot Qe7 move.

I saw this brevity and I couldn't help playing through it to see how The Dentist managed to pulverise his opponent in just TWELVE MOVES!  I saw how he showed his opponent the utter folly of leaving the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected.  Yes white was certainly awakened from a Fool's Paradise.

The Dentist may have a low rating but as you saw with my earlier annotated game ""In the Dentist's Chair"" in which I very nearly lost he is not to be underestimated!  Now white really feels the drill as a lot of enammel is about to disappear from his side of the board!!"

307,16,4,Qb6,b'rnb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/pq2p3/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A first for me personally. Instead of Bc5 Qb6. This has the same effect as the line mentioned in the previous page except Qg4 does not cause any problems for black as the bishop is still at home. Therefore normal development should be continued.

I know a lot of people say the Queen is not ""in play"" however I think with the open diagonal the queen can be brought into the game effectively at any stage.

If the pawn exchange happens white is in a better position due to the threat on the knight and now after the knight exchange black forces whites Bishop off of the very nice position he has took up.

This is a bad move although threatening the bishop/c2 pawn hoping to gain tempi white now has a game which if not noticed by black (which by this move it has not been) is won. I can understand the idea behind it though. If black initiates the pawn exchange he is still on the back foot where as if white initiates the exchange black looks better. Perhaps Initiating the exchange would have been better or g6.

- usually develop N and B before R or Q

- Bc8 is still blocked in 
- still 2 moves required to castle

Black now needs to think about simplifying the position and swapping off material until his extra piece is decisive. First objective take off that N on d6 second get all pieces active.
380,20,7,Bd5,b'3r1k1r/1p2nppp/p1qN4/2pbP3/P7/2P5/5PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Nc8 puts more pressure on the N(d6) and will probably win the e5 pawn too and leave Q   R in control of d file. Nice and simple !

Again as always tell me about any logical errors or typos.

This is probably the most flexible way for White to start the game. It forces Black to choose what to do without wasting a tempo."
486,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',Black decides to play for a Sicilian or English set up.
487,23,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White immediately challenges Black's center. It should be noted that White has so far done an excellent job of remaining flexible. This game could transition into QGD or QGA territory or into Sicilian lines still. This game remains very open ended.
488,23,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3p4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"I try hard not to do this when I annotate but I'm going to step into my personal feelings about the game from behind the Black pieces rather than be objective for just a second.

I am a fairly conservative player who likes to keep opening lines fairly fixed. The way White has played until now was driving me absolutely crazy because there was no guarantee as to which opening the game would move into.

So Black decides to eliminate the QG lines and the English lines. Of course White still has the option of guiding the game into tons of other openings and things that resemble other openings. White is still very flexible."
489,23,4,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3N4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Recapturing with the Queen would have simply wasted a tempo after 3. ...Nc6.
490,23,5,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3N4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black is trying to get rid of the flexibility of the position still.
491,23,6,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Finally White commits to something. Now that he's decided what he wants to play Black can start to form a plan of attack (or defense).
492,23,7,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black begins his development by giving his Bishop access to the long diagonal.
493,23,8,e4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',"Now White has really committed to an opening. This is called the Maroczy Bind for White. Black's specific line of the Sicilian here is the Accelerated Dragon.

White's control of the light squares will cause Black a lot of trouble trying to get his light-squared Bishop into an effective position. Normally in the Accelerated Dragon Black has enough trouble with that but with a Maroczy Bind it becomes and absolute nightmare."
494,23,9,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is now book Accelerated Dragon against the Maroczy Bind.
495,23,10,Nxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2N3p1/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This however is not. The capture of the Knight on c6 is normally characteristic of very sharp games. Normally in the Maroczy Bind White wants to keep Black's play to a minimum but by doing this he removes his Knight from its powerful post on d4 and releases tension in the center. He also increases the Bishop on g7's power tremendously.
496,23,11,Qc2,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/2P1P3/8/PPQ2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"I would assume that this move stems from the pressure coming from the g7 Bishop.

However it should also serve as a clue to Black that White could be planning to castle long. Of course Black can't know absolutely yet but this move hints at it."
497,23,12,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/8/PPQ2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black simply continues developing. He's ready to castle now and adding pressure to the center.
498,23,13,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',White has to develop too of course! This placement on his Knight relieves a bit of the pressure that Black is applying to the center. 
499,23,14,Qa5,b'r1b1k2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/q7/2P1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',This was a wasted move. The Black Queen ends up going straight back to c7.
500,23,15,Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/p1qpppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',"Now there is a slight tension between the Queens. It's nothing large yet but it affects both players' central plans. If Black ever tries to open the center with ...d5 the resulting trades would open the c-file for the Queens to have at each other.

This isn't to say that both players should try to put as much pressure on the c-file as possible yet only that they should consider this small tension in their plans and calculations."
501,23,16,1Bd3,b'r1b1k2r/p1qpppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Both of White's Bishop's are activated and gunning for the kingside. If the Queen on c2 weren't a good enough hint this is a clear indication that White plans to castle queenside. The only reason this can be so readily determined is that the light-squared Bishop has no entry into Black's position unless White launches a kingside pawn storm and usually you don't storm with pawns in front of the King.
502,23,17,1d6,b'r1b1k2r/p1q1ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',"Black is now committing to playing with the Bind in place meaning that he doesn't intend to challenge it. Black needs to be very careful when he does this because it commits him to carefully watching White's powerful attacking ideas for the duration of the Bind.

Black's idea here isn't to develop the Bishop (it's fairly useless everywhere that's the nature of the Maroczy Bind) but to connect the Rooks in a couple of moves. He will put his Bishop on e6 (which blocks the pawn but it's safe) so that it can apply the infinitesimal amount of pressure it's capable of applying. 

I think though that Black would have been better off if he had just played ...Ba6 at some point and left his Queen's scope untouched."

Also it should be noted that by placing his King on the c-file White has created more tension (negative tension for him) there."
504,23,19,1Be6,b'r3k2r/p1q1ppbp/2ppbnp1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/2KR3R w kq -',The Bishop adds its small bit of tension to the c-file.

However he needs to be constantly ready to defend against any possible attacks that White can initiate on the kingside which means that Black's minor pieces are basically stuck defending.
509,23,24,1Be3,b'r4rk1/p1q1ppb1/2ppbnp1/7p/2P1P2P/2NBBP2/PPQ3P1/2KR3R b - -',White is now beginning to take advantage of Black's tethered pieces by placing his on its optimum square. It is often said that when there are no threats to you or you have time to spare that you should place all of your pieces on their optimum squares before launching your attack and that is exactly what White did.
510,23,25,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p1q1ppb1/2ppbnp1/7p/2P1P2P/2NBBP2/PPQ3P1/2KR3R w - -',Black decides to begin to do the same for his pieces. However his minor pieces are chained to the defense of the kingside so the effect of his optimally placed pieces will be considerably less than White's pieces' effect. This is one of the key elements of the Maroczy Bind if Black doesn't manage to break it down (or in this case Black doesn't even try to break it down).
511,23,26,1Be2,b'1r3rk1/p1q1ppb1/2ppbnp1/7p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PPQ1B1P1/2KR3R b - -',White continues to increase the value of his pieces. If this were a video I would make all of the arrows from White's pieces into Black's kingside but since I can't you'll have to imagine them. The Rook on h1 influences the entire h-file. The two Bishops and the Queen pressure virtually every diagonal leading into the Black camp (notice that the light-squared Bishop is going to facilitate g4 after Rg1 (after Rg1 notice the new imaginary arrow pointing directly at the Black King)). White's attack is swelling to unbelievable strength.
512,23,27,1Rb7,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/2ppbnp1/7p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PPQ1B1P1/2KR3R w - -',Black ignores White's threat. He prepares to double his Rooks on the b-file and create an invasion of his own. However I think that it would come just too late. If 16. Rdg1 Rgb8 17. b3! and Black's attack is stopped for long enough for White to start his own.
513,23,28,1Kd2,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/2ppbnp1/7p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PPQKB1P1/3R3R b - -',White has not only wasted that precious tempo but he has made his King critically weak! Suddenly the pressure on the c and b-files seems stronger and now Black has a reason to blow the center wide open!
514,23,29,1d5,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/2p1bnp1/3p3p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PPQKB1P1/3R3R w - -',Although Black has been happy to play in the cramped time-critical Maroczy Bind he has been nicely prompted by White to shatter the center and start a vicious counterattack.
515,23,30,1exd5,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/2p1bnp1/3P3p/2P4P/2N1BP2/PPQKB1P1/3R3R b - -',This sequence of moves is kind of cool to me because you can watch the center loosen brick by brick. You can also watch Black's pieces become tremendously powerful. White's pieces will go from well-placed for attack to terribly placed as White needs to defend quickly (and they won't even have to move!).
516,23,31,Nxd5,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/4b1p1/3n3p/7P/2N1BP2/PPQKB1P1/3R3R w - -',Now we can see the tension between the Queens that I mentioned at the beginning. Though it would have been possible for the game to finish without this tension ever having been exploited it was one of the subtleties of the position.
517,23,32,1Nxd5,b'5rk1/prq1ppb1/4b1p1/3N3p/7P/4BP2/PPQKB1P1/3R3R b - -',Black sees an interesting tactic where he at least wins a piece after 19. ...Qxc2  20. Kxc2 Rxb2  21. Kd3 (21. Kc1 is what happened in the game) Bf5  22. Kc4 Rc8  23. Bc5 Rc2

Rc8 much better as once the queen moves you can safely extract the knight to c2 which puts you up a rook verses 3 extra pawns by white. No need to fear 33.Qxd5 as QxQ RxQ still gives you Kc2. If 33.Rxd5 then Black replies RxQ 34.RxQ KxR 36.BxN Rc1 and you capture the bishop next.

Non ha rischiato! Star� vincendo?

My God che posizione complicata!
Per la mossa 20 ci ho messo non so quanto e ho studiato mille possibilit�. Il problema � salvare il cavallo g5 senza portarlo indieto a f6 il che non si pu� per Donna x g8. Anche se poi Ad4 salva la torre non � simpatico farsi mangiare un'altro pedone.
Allora questo � il trucco. Facciamo andare avanti il pedone in f2. Qui abbiamo: 
1) DxC. Allora alfiere d4 e con la minaccia alla torre ha tempo di coprire g7. Qua il bianco o salva la torre o salva il cavallo e io recupero il mio pezzo. 
Il problema resta sempre: c'� compensazione per la qualit� persa se salva il cavallo? Per esempio su f7?
2) Cc3 o d2. 
In queste due il tema consiste nel far ritirare l'alfiere bianco a f3 e poi con l'alfiere minacciare la dama e h2. 
Se il cavallo muove in d2 non vale Ad4 perch� mi cede la torre per i miei due pezzi. 
Quindi devo muovere Cg8-f6 perch� il punto g2 diventa veramente vulnerabile con il cavallo in f6.
Il problema � h2-h3 devo ritirare il cavallo. 
Posso fare arrocco per minacciare l'alfiere. 
Posso togliere il re per minacciare l'alfiere lasciando per� la torre in h pensando eventualmente un colpo tattico con a5 in risposta ad h3 per aprire l'azione della torre sulla colonna h con effetti almeno spaventosi se non reali minimo di patta per scacco perpetuo!
Posso provare con Ad4 
e posso provare con Ad6. 
Tra le due mi fa pi� paura la seconda perch� se non si chiude la dama questa dopo Ad6 fugge a c3 minacciando uno scomodo scacco in c8. Ma si pu� arroccare non salvando quindi il cavallo in g4 ma minacciando l'alfiere a1.
Insomma se sto a spiegare tutto scrivo un libro."

Due possibilit�: o Ce3 e se f2xe3 Axe3  Rh1 (ma anche Tf2) Axc1 e la donna bianca NON PU� prendere in g7 per la potente sorpresa Df2!! con minaccia di matto che fa strage insieme al pedone. Per� se NON prende in g7 e semplicemente mette la torre in c1... le nere sono senza mosse buone. A Dd4 segue un mondo di varianti troppo incerte per poterci contare con possibilit� tattiche impressionanti per entrambi. Lo scacco in b8 Ha un finale felice per le bianche o devono rimanere con la patta per scacco perpetuo? E se invece NON vanno in b8 ma Txc7 le nere hanno compensazione?
2) Cg8-f6. Se h2-h3 Ce5 e se ora Dxg7 Cg8! minacciando lo scacco di cavallo che lascia scoperta la regina. Ma se NON prende in g8?
Le varianti sono un sacco ed analizzare questa posizione � molto molto difficile per me...
3) Axc3... e qui due mondi diversi: Dxc3 con una doppia minaccia in c8 o g7 che per� ha la contromossa Cg8-e7!? che tappa sia l'alfiere sia la dama per lo scacco sulla diagonale bianca. E se Dxg7 Tg8 � addirittura favorevole per le nere con un gioco tattico complicatissimo ma che il nero vince se riesce a portare il cavallo in d3 nonostante gli scacchi di alfiere e dama. Difficile per� analizzare tutte le varianti del bianco.
Ma c'� anche la semplice DxCg4. Axc3 poi Txc7 non sembra dare sufficiente compensazione alle nere per cui si pu� pensare a Cg8-f6 ma anche l� non vedo molte uscite. Dxg7 Ce4 e dovunque si ritiri la donna c'� la minaccia Cd2 che incombe anche qui con gioco complicatissimo.
Oppure: Dxg7 Tg8 Dxh6 Cg4 Dh4 Af6 Dh3 Ae4 o Th8 e le nere hanno un attacco potentissimo. C'� anche la trappola Dxg7 Tg8 Dxh6 Cg4 e se DH6 direttamente Db1!! e per il matto in h2 non pu� prendere l'alfiere e poi vince. 
Ma c'� da fidarsi di quest'analisi??? Se per esempio invece di prendere g7 si limita a ritirare la donna... vale ancora la pena per il nero? 
Si potrebbe scommettere che prender� l'alfiere in quanto sembra valere pi� del cavallo? "

Incredible but true. I threaten the bishop at the moment. 
If 23... Be5 the queen must go but if Qxg7 Ne4 wins a piece and h2 is still threatened.



Grande e definitivo errore del nero cio� mio. 
La mossa giusta era arrocco. O Ae5.

Il fatto � che mi sono perso riguardando tutte le possibili varianti tra sacrifici prese pericolose della donna bianca in g7 (che in molti varianti giocava a mio favore per esempio se il mio cavallo andava in e5 e dopo Dxg7 togliendo il Cf6 c'era la minaccia Cf3 ! vincendo la donna anche se questa avesse preso intanto la torre h8... d'altra parte le nere possono giocare con la ritirata Ae4 la presa in h2 sia di cavallo che di alfiere con tutt i problemi tattici che ne derivano... insomma un mondo...). 
Sono giunto alla conclusione che potevo farla. Del resto minacciava l'alfiere. 
Qua le reazioni potevano essere sia ritirare l'alfiere sia minacciare il cavallo con h3 ed in entrambi i casi il gioco che ne sorge � molto tattico e pericoloso per entrambi. 
Per esempio se ritira l'alfiere a f3 con Ae5 inizio un gioco ricco che prevede in alcune varianti la perdita della donna bianca e comunque la presa in h2... se � che poi questa mi da veramente qualche vantaggio cosa non da poco da decidere...

E non dimentichiamo 24. Cd5! Figuriamoci se uno come me non la vede!
E anche qua le analisi varianti dei temi precedenti mi sono sembrate a mio favore... sbagliando! ma con anche molte varianti in cui erano le nere a rimanere con vantaggio materiale!

E non ho pensato che comunque gran parte di tutte quelle analisi e di tutti quei rischi erano inutili potendo semplicemente arroccare con lo stesso effetto di minacciare l'alfiere a8!

Il fatto � che avevo cominciato tutto questo discorso con l'idea di vedere se Re7 fosse un'alternativa all'arrocco se mai. Siccome si � complicata troppo l'ho presa come l'unica mossa da considerare mi sono dimenticato che era solo un ramo dell'analisi. 

Evvabb� succede!

898,35,10,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P7/1PPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',now hes setting up and its clear his next few moves are going to get alot of pieces into action when evaluating figure him to look at different pieces for every next move no single attacks now that my king is protected also i failed to open up the middle so I must also set up anticipate his set up to put the bishop into play soon
899,35,11,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',when i made this move i was planning on challenging his knight i was willing to let the pawns control the bishops at this point and my standing knight may be the advantage
900,35,12,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',hes not doing anything with that knight now there is no protection on my king side so i need to set up more since I can run with free bishops I give it a shot

Qf2 O-O 14. c3 trade queens and decent queen side position but I knew he wouldnt let the queen trade happen so early and I didnt spend enough time figuring out the alternatives instead I tried to push his queen around by asking him to give up the center one way or another expecting 12. c3 dxc3 13. Be3 queen to move.  Obv I didnt put alot of thought into it past this point and didnt see the next move basically ruining my plan
904,35,16,Bc5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1q3n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/P1pPB3/1P2Q1PP/RN3RK1 w kq -',I should have seen this coming and how hard my bishop is in trouble.  At this point I think I may have just lost the game and im scrambling to recover from the mistake.  If i dont move my queen and try to relieve pressure elsewhere 14. ... Bg4 and then im boned.  Qf2 (my original plan) is foolish he takes my bishop and im still rocked and if I try pressure elsewhere with h3 or the even worse b4 he still wins the bishop only move is to take his bishop and try to solidify position later

I thought about this move for a while and when I realized that I was pretty happy with the outcome and decided I would just take the loss of b2 in stride as it would improve my position queen side again when he takes the extra pawn grats khalil

907,35,19,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2q1p3/2B1P3/P2P4/1Q4PP/RN3R1K w - -',this is sort of obv thinking from his side i dont know of any way for him to prepare a safe attack either this was a setup move now i need to take this opportunity to get the rest of my pieces into play and i have the easy decision Nc3 preparing Nd5 for later in the game when he gives up defense of it from his knight.  If wanted to move Rf5 as well but his current position is holding the bisop off the king side but that would force points trade for the next few moves leaving me in a spot i didnt think I could recover from
908,35,20,Ng4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/8/2q1p3/2B1P1n1/P1NP4/1Q4PP/R4R1K w - -',This is a fairly obv mistake unless he expects me move my rook or queen off defense of f2.  The most important factor is that he is opened up an all out attack for me on f7.  Secondly he freed my knight to own d5 which I was planning for long term position.  Noticing that f2 is in no real danger (after a long thought) I went ahead with my plan to take the center board.
909,35,21,Qd6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3q4/3Np3/2B1P1n1/P2P4/1Q4PP/R4R1K w - -',I think right here he also noticed f2 was a lost cause since I didnt bite and was now trying to protect the pawn at e5 since I had 18. ... Qe5 19. ... Qc7 adding lots of pressure to his undeveloped pieces though that isnt fully thought out.  Either way it is a defensive play which left me in one of those spots thinking about future moves and decided to figure out an attack.  I thought about removing his knight with h3 forcing retreat and giving me the chance to take control of space but I decided I had enough space and could attack the knight whenever I wanted to so I positioned for a long sequence attack.
910,35,22,1Rac1,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3q4/3Np3/2B1P1n1/P2P4/1Q4PP/2R2R1K b - -',Rac1! imo.  My next move is obv Nc7 with no even trade posibility for black he is on full defense.

The attack is now is full steam however and mate opportunities a many should he believe my next move is hanging the knight.  a6 showed that he recognized it but the advantage is significant proceed as planned.  Only one move that looks to avoid catasptrophe Rb8.
912,35,24,Ra7,b'2b2rk1/rpN2ppp/p2q4/4p3/2B1P1n1/P2P4/1Q4PP/2R2R1K w - -',I think this was a mistake Rb8 looks far better and would have kept his rook in play.

Kingside advance would likely to lead nowhere.its time to find your 7th rank position. best way to do that is through c file is to drible threatning the weak pawn in d5 by 23...Rb5 24.Bc3 24...Rc5 if white tries to trade then Rc3! and you have a black bishop to back up and queenside is yours. this is the true advantage of bishop of different colour when there is no such bishop with your enemy or knights. E file is not the right path since white bishop is guarding.

1013,39,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',*back one for intro* My standard as of late. Shooting for a Reti but ready and willing to transpose to QG lines.
1014,39,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I'm perversely proud of the fact that I've never in my OTB life played 1. e4 so any variation of QGD lines are just fine by me.
1015,39,2,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',For anyone putting together a scouting report on me this capture will absolutely positively be made in this position every time. My goal is to jump on the c file as quickly as possible via Rc1 after developing the queenside pieces (Bg5 and Nc3 or Nd2).
1016,39,3,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Correct. [4...Nxd5 e4! with tempo and a nice real estate grab]
1017,39,4,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! f5 and g4 are much more natural squares. This bishop is now basically a pawn.

I'm gambling a little here that he will make what I considered to be a logical next move in 0-0 thereby winning a pawn as his Nf6 is pinned to his queen.
1022,39,9,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Bingo....he didn't see the tactic.

I'm prepared to sac him for just about anything to open that h file and I see 0-0-0 in my near future.

1030,39,17,1Ndf6,b'r4r1k/pp3pp1/2pqbn2/3p1B1n/3P3P/2N1PN2/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Whoa.....slow down there fella. You are supposed to lamely submit to my will and make moves that I intend you to. You are screwing around with my coronation.

Better was probably just to go ahead trade off light squared bishops and get closer to an advantageous endgame. After my lapse the last move I decide to make what I considered to be the most threatening looking move I could to re-establish my dominance in this mental struggle. I continue to think of how cool 4-0 sounds and my grasp of the game at hand starts slipping. 
1032,39,19,1Nd7,b'r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqb3/3pNB1n/3P3P/2N1P3/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',!? Normally not wise to trade down when behind in material this move got my leg to shaking. BxB fxB activates his Rf8. NxN trades down but I lose a beautifully posted knight and his threat on f7 (which may come in handy as I'm still seriously bearing down on his king). So I decide to start attacking in earnest by playing.....
1033,39,20,1g4,b'r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqb3/3pNB1n/3P2PP/2N1P3/PPQ2P2/R3K2R b KQ g3',?! Good and bad. Good in the sense I press forward with my assualt on his kingside and still have time to 0-0-0 but bad in the sense that I help him get his Nh5 off of the edge and into a more active role. I'd give white a small edge here but it is tenuous. After dissecting this game I'm pretty sure 0-0-0 was needed here immediately as my upcoming meltdown is aggravated by the fact that my king is still in the center of the board. I continue to think I'm invincible.
1034,39,21,1Nxd7,b'r4r1k/pp1N1pp1/2pqbn2/3p1B2/3P2PP/2N1P3/PPQ2P2/R3K2R b KQ -',Now more comfortable with exchanges as my g and h pawns are now free to raise some Cain.

1036,39,23,2f3,b'r4r1k/pp3pp1/2p1qn2/3p4/3P2PP/2N1PP2/PPQ5/R3K2R b KQ -',?? Your PC is working just fine. You are not experiencing technical difficulties. I actually made this move in public. All of my inner dialogue garbage about how great I am distracted me to the point of an actual mental vacuum. In my rush to protect my g pawn I open the front door and ask the armed assailant wearing a mask if he would like to come in for a cup of coffee.

Given the choice of keeping either my d or f pawn I choose the f pawn because I will need some king cover. Of course that means either my king or queen will have to move next if he doesn't play Qxd4 to avoid a royal pin.
1039,39,26,2Qxd4,b'r4r1k/pp3pp1/2p2n2/3p4/3q2PP/2N2P2/PP2Q3/R3K2R w KQ -',Natural and safe but either rook to e8 is lethal.

Then I realized that I may be able to gain enough time to play h6 or Rde1 next with hopes of finding a check to play. I simply don't analyze far enough ahead and the resulting position he achieves after we exchange rooks is with check leaving me even more totally demoralized than before.

1052,39,39,3Qa3+,b'7k/pp3pp1/2p5/3p2PP/5P2/q5K1/P7/4Q3 w - -',It's interesting to note that this is the only square black can check me from. In doing so he allows me to press forward with my king (which turns out to be nicely shielded). I regain a little hope.
1053,39,40,Qf8,b'5q1k/pp3pp1/2p5/3p2PP/5PK1/8/P7/4Q3 w - -',Black realizes his queen is not exerting much influence on a3 and retreats her to a position of power and defense. Nice move.
1054,39,41,3Qe5,b'5q1k/pp3pp1/2p5/3pQ1PP/5PK1/8/P7/8 b - -',! Reaching the most active square for the queen. Threats abound once a pawn is pushed and the black queen now appears to be hemmed in to a large degree.
1055,39,42,3Qc8+,b'2q4k/pp3pp1/2p5/3pQ1PP/5PK1/8/P7/8 w - -',Untangling the right way with a hard right to the jaw.
1056,39,43,3f5,b'2q4k/pp3pp1/2p5/3pQPPP/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',It really is all or nothing for white. Down on material but with immediate threats available and a king that can't be immediately checked I start silently singing that song about an ant and a rubber tree plant.
1057,39,44,3Kh7,b'2q5/pp3ppk/2p5/3pQPPP/6K1/8/P7/8 w - -',Unpinning the king but inching closer to danger. White decides to pull the trigger.
1058,39,45,3g6+,b'2q5/pp3ppk/2p3P1/3pQP1P/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',It suddenly occured to me that a grown man engaged in a contest of mental prowess really shouldn't be singing song about ants rubber tree plants and high hopes. I switch songs to Van Halen's 'Right Now' and pass the point of no return.
1059,39,46,3fxg6,b'2q5/pp4pk/2p3p1/3pQP1P/6K1/8/P7/8 w - -',?! Kg8 was better. Black was probably counting on the fact that my f pawn is frozen but this move allows the opening of the h file.
1060,39,47,Kg8,b'2q3k1/pp4p1/2p3P1/3pQP2/6K1/8/P7/8 w - -',Too late. White's king is safe and he now has time to reach h7 or h8 with threats.
1061,39,48,Qe8,b'4q1k1/pp4p1/2p3P1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P6Q/8 w - -',Desperately seeking a check.
1062,39,49,4Qh7+,b'4q1k1/pp4pQ/2p3P1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',Right NOW! Hey! There's no tomorrow......
1063,39,50,4Qh8+,b'4qk1Q/pp4p1/2p3P1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',Right NOW! C'mon it's everything!
1064,39,51,4Qxg7+,b'4q3/pp2k1Q1/2p3P1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',Catch your magic moment!
1065,39,52,4Qf6+,b'3kq3/pp6/2p2QP1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P7/8 b - -',Do it right here and NOW!
1066,39,53,4Qe7,b'3k4/pp2q3/2p2QP1/3p1P2/6K1/8/P7/8 w - -',Any king move and white forces a trade of queens and wins the race to promotion.
1067,39,54,4Kg5,b'3k4/pp2q3/2p2QP1/3p1PK1/8/8/P7/8 b - -',! Not a position you see every day. Both queens are pinned to their mates by their counterparts. White is totally cool with that - if black takes white retakes and maneuvers to push the f pawn. If he doesn't take white plays g7.
1068,39,55,4d4,b'3k4/pp2q3/2p2QP1/5PK1/3p4/8/P7/8 w - -',He's running a marathon......
1069,39,56,4g7,b'3k4/pp2q1P1/2p2Q2/5PK1/3p4/8/P7/8 b - -',....and I just have a short sprint. Black resigns and I take my first serious deep breath in over an hour. I remember that I have just gone 4-0 and promptly try to forget about the way I almost just screwed the pooch. Later in analysis and also as I write this I attempt to somehow achieve catharsis regarding my own limitations as a chess player. While it is good to know that I can overcome blunders like 20. f3 my main problem is allowing moves like that to even enter my mind. Distractions random thoughts and for me even the wrong inner music (does anyone else do that?) all detract me from the board tourney after tourney. Lack of focus is the only reason I can't improve past my USCF high of 1514. That and the fact that I can't play OTB in my boxer shorts smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. Many thanks to Patrick B. for the fine game - you really pushed me man.
