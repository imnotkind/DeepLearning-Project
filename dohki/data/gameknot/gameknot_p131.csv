Therefore I prevented him from playing Nd4 with this pawn move.

Instead I also threaten to capture his other knight with Bxc6 but this was a strategical blunder with one detail that I missed since I was not completely accurate in my judgement.  Therefore it will not be an even exchange but he will get an extra free piece after the exchange.  In this position I learned that one must have complete and precise judgement 100% of the time.

I also did not want two bad pawns on the e square so I did not make the capture.  Instead I threatened to capture his knight with dxc6 because I was hoping that it would lead to a captured piece.  However this was not the case.  In fact this was a bad choice and a serious blunder because he will now threaten to capture my queen with Nxb3.  
109,2,23,1Na5,b'r2qr1k1/1bppnpp1/p6p/np1Pp3/4P3/1QP2N2/PP3PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',Now I must find a way to protect my queen and it is not going to be easy.

In addition I only have two options as to where I move the knight.  I did not play Nb3 since I do not like to put my knight on the ""end zone"" unless it is necessary which is sometimes the case.  That is because placing knights on the a or h files make them less valuable and give them less room to escape from danger."

Even exchanges are ok if the player has the same amount or more material then the opponent.  However they do not work if the player is ""down material"".  In addition he threatens to play a fork between my king and rook with Re1+ due to the exchange.  If this happens he will win a free rook with Rxa1 but I am not about to let that happen."
124,2,38,2Ne4,b'4r1k1/3p1pp1/p1n4p/1p6/n3N3/2P2P2/PP5P/R5K1 b - -',I believed that I was forced to bring out my knight in order to stop this threat but I misjudged.  He would not have been able to get a free rook due to the position.

129,2,43,2Rxb2,b'6k1/5pp1/p1nN3p/1p1p4/n7/2P2P2/PR5P/6K1 b - -',I figured that capturing his pawn with Rxb2 would address this problem immediately by exchanging the piece.  However this was my biggest mistake because I forgot about his knight on a4 (another important detail) so there was no exchange here.  Instead he got a free rook.
130,2,44,2Nxb2,b'6k1/5pp1/p1nN3p/1p1p4/8/2P2P2/Pn5P/6K1 w - -',That mistake forces me into resignation because he has both of his knights six pawns and his king but I only have a knight three pawns and the king.  Therefore he is going to get at least one pawn promotion and there is nothing that I could do about that since it is inevitable.  This game proves that every supporting detail matters in chess even the minor supporting points.

The numbers seem to give 'd4' a slight edge but I like Fischer's playing style and he felt the King's pawn opening was 'best by test'.

It keeps the Queen from developing to e7 and black's dark square Bishop has stifled his ability to open space with a Queen's pawn push.  This move also targets the weak g7 square.  But what I like most about this move is it prepares to take away black's ability to castle...
153,4,8,Be5,b'r2qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1pn2n2/4bN2/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',It appears black thought I was looking to exchange my Knight for his Bishop.  Perhaps he did not want to ruin his queenside pawn structure because he plans to castle queenside?

This move does weaken the King's defense slightly but I have three powerful pieces currently along the back rank and the real intention is to bring the Rook on f1 to bear.

However I made a comeback with some important techniques.  First I remembered Jack Stockel's advice about finding a way out of trouble since it is feasible 99.7% of the time.  I also remembered him telling me to ""Study the positions and think about things"".  Second I used some of -chess's- techniques during our past games and he is BTW a master with almost a 2100 rating.  "

First I thought that b3 would prevent him from threatening my knight with Bb4 but a3 would have done this instead.  Second it allows him to bring out his queen which could be disastrous in this position.  This flaw occurred because I once again misunderstood the Game DB since I was not basing it on the most amount finished games.  That is the correct and most successful way to use this feature.  Instead I based the feature on the highest rating and percentages of wins but I recently learned that those wins are masters who do this with unprecedented moves.  This flaw will force me to think and act critically in order to avoid the ""Scholars Mate"".     "

I should have played Rxg1 as opposed to g3 because it would have been an even exchange between my knight and his bishop in this position.  Instead I inadvertently gave him a free knight because this allows him to pull his bishop away.

In other words he said that it is only okay to give up pieces if a person is going to win by checkmating his or her opponent in one move or is going to win a more powerful piece such as the queen or rook.  That was the case here because I remembered how -chess- did this since he sacrificed pieces like a bishop or knight in other games.  Then he played powerful forks against me between my queen and rook forcing me to resign.  Therefore I sacked my bishop by threatening his queen with Bxc6 instead of castling but that was not a mistake this time.

379,8,20,1b3,b'r4rk1/p1p3pp/1ppnbp2/4p3/8/PPP1B2P/2PN1PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',White starts to take squares away from my white bishop and my knight.

If white captures my knight I can just recapture with my pawn on d7 un-doubling my pawns and improving my centre. It also gives me the chance to win another pawn with ...Nxd4 17. bxd4 Bxd4.

389,8,30,1c4,b'r3r1k1/p1p3pp/1pNnb3/2p2p2/2P1pP2/PP2B2P/2P3P1/3R1RK1 b - -',White takes a square away from my bishop

391,8,32,2Ne5,b'r3r1k1/2p3pp/1p1nb3/p1p1Np2/2P1pP2/PP2B2P/2P3P1/3R1RK1 b - -',White moves his knight back to a safe outpost.

401,8,42,2Rxd8,b'3Rr1k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/pPb1pP2/4B2P/2P2RP1/6K1 b - -',I think white made a mistake by accepting the exchange of rooks like this - when I recapture I have control of the d file.

405,8,46,2Kh2,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/pPb1pP2/2P1B2P/5RPK/3r4 b - -',White moves his king out of the way. Would rook f1 have been better? Once the rooks are swapped can white defend against the passed pawn on a4 with his bishop and use his king to stop the pawn on e4?
406,8,47,2a3,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/1Pb1pP2/p1P1B2P/5RPK/3r4 w - -',I push my passed pawn - creating a serious problem for white.
407,8,48,2Bd4,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/1PbBpP2/p1P4P/5RPK/3r4 b - -',White doesn't have many options but I don't think that this move helps. The c3 pawn is going nowhere so it prevents white's bishop defending a1 from the advancing pawn.
408,8,49,2a2,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/1PbBpP2/2P4P/p4RPK/3r4 w - -',I push my pawn again. White must now either lose a rook or I promote my pawn to a queen.

410,8,51,2Bxa2,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/1P1BpP2/2P4P/b5PK/3r4 w - -',I grab the rook! White could probably resign here.
411,8,52,3g4,b'6k1/2p3pp/1p6/5p2/1P1BpPP1/2P4P/b6K/3r4 b - g3',White now has a siginificant material disadvantage. g3 may have been better here - since that does not lead to a further reduction in material on the board.
412,8,53,3g6,b'6k1/2p4p/1p4p1/5p2/1P1BpPP1/2P4P/b6K/3r4 w - -',I don't swap pawns on g4 - this would leave e4 undefended.
413,8,54,3gxf5,b'6k1/2p4p/1p4p1/5P2/1P1BpP2/2P4P/b6K/3r4 b - -',White takes my pawn on e5. It's generally better not to swap pieces or pawns when you are material down so I'm not sure this is a good idea.

417,8,58,3Bxc7,b'6k1/2B4p/1p6/5p2/1P3P2/2P1p2P/b6K/3r4 b - -',White starts capturing my undefended pawns. Those pawns are no longer important in the game though. By doing this white gives up his last chance to stop my pawn on e3 queening. Bd4 would have been better followed by Bf2 defending e1 from the pawn promotion threat.

White lost by timeout at this point! The outcome would not have been any better for him had he played on though:

37. Bf2 Kxf2++

b) Qc3 to prevent Rb2 seams the best but also I don't see any long term plan...
c) Qd3 to attack black's rook this seams to me the least relevant one as black has several good alternatives either to back-up his rook in the open e column or move it along the e column to an unattacked square or even the best in my opinion move it to b2 were threatens Rb4 attacking a4 and preventing any support from behind to my passed b pawn"

563,11,28,1Rd1,b'r3k2r/p2q1pbp/3p2p1/2p5/4P1n1/2P1B3/PP2QPPP/RN1R2K1 b kq -',I take the ready to open d-file. I just pinned his d-pawn against his queen. His c5 pawn is free for me to take now with my bishop. He is compelled to do anything about it.
564,11,29,1Be5,b'r3k2r/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P1n1/2P1B3/PP2QPPP/RN1R2K1 w kq -',He now threatens me with a double attack on h2 by his knight and his bishop. He might take back the pawn I'm ahead so I won't allow it.
565,11,30,1h3,b'r3k2r/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P1n1/2P1B2P/PP2QPP1/RN1R2K1 b kq -',With this move ne no longer can take the pawn and also I challenge his knight. Whatever plan he has for his knight he must do it now.
566,11,31,1Nxe3,b'r3k2r/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P3/2P1n2P/PP2QPP1/RN1R2K1 w kq -',Captures my bishop of course that's my most dangerous piece at the moment.
567,11,32,1Qxe3,b'r3k2r/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/RN1R2K1 b kq -',I recapture with queen this way I keep his c-pawn en prise once he castles.
568,11,33,1O-O,b'r4rk1/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/RN1R2K1 w - -',He castles... not the best moment to castle his c pawn is en prise since his d-pawn is pinned against his queen. I can take the pawn with my queen for free...
569,11,34,1Nd2,b'r4rk1/p2q1p1p/3p2p1/2p1b3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP1N1PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',But I don't do it. If I capture the pawn he will get the lead of the game now once he starts challenging my queen with his rocks and he'll start adding pressure over my c and b pawns since he has a bishop already attacking that diagonal. I better develop mi knight to d2 so I can take it to c4... If I put my knight there he'll have to deal with my fork over his pinned d pawn and his bishop. Since his d-pawn is pinned his bishop won't be defended and it will have to abandon e5 and then my knight and rock will outnumber the only defender of d-pawn the queen.
570,11,35,1a5,b'r4rk1/3q1p1p/3p2p1/p1p1b3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP1N1PP1/R2R2K1 w - a6',A mistake he should have prevented me from taking my knight to c4...
571,11,36,1Nc4,b'r4rk1/3q1p1p/3p2p1/p1p1b3/2N1P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',So Nc4 it is. Now he has 2 choices retreating his bishop and letting me capture the d pawn with my rock while I put his queen en prise Or moving the queen aside and let me go for the exchanges while also opening up the d-file. Either way I will open the d-file which was my original goal.
572,11,37,1Qb7,b'r4rk1/1q3p1p/3p2p1/p1p1b3/2N1P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',"He puts his queen in a place where she will capture a pawn of mine... If I go for the ""free pawn"" and challenge his queen with my knight she'll recapture b2. I can't use the rock to init the exchanges or I will lose in the exchanges... So I have to take the bishop so I can have a time to protect my b pawn."
573,11,38,2Nxe5,b'r4rk1/1q3p1p/3p2p1/p1p1N3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',I take the bishop. If he takes the pawn I'll just retract my bishop to c4 to fork his queen and already attacked d-pawn so he'll have lost a whole bishop for no reason. He has to deal with my knight first.
574,11,39,2dxe5,b'r4rk1/1q3p1p/6p1/p1p1p3/4P3/2P1Q2P/PP3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',So he does.
575,11,40,2b3,b'r4rk1/1q3p1p/6p1/p1p1p3/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P4PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',And I use the extra time to protect my b-pawn.
576,11,41,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1q3p1p/6p1/p1p1p3/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P4PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',His c pawn is en-prise so he protects it.
577,11,42,2Rd5,b'2r2rk1/1q3p1p/6p1/p1pRp3/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P4PP1/R5K1 b - -',I fork his c and e pawns with my rock. He must use his queen to defend both coz c pawn is under double attack from my queen and rock and e pawn is now attacked by my rock.
578,11,43,2Qe7,b'2r2rk1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pRp3/4P3/1PP1Q2P/P4PP1/R5K1 w - -',He protects his pawns.
579,11,44,2c4,b'2r2rk1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pRp3/2P1P3/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/R5K1 b - -',I take the chance to solidify my pawns structure... THIS is what gave me the winning in this game. Soon you'll see why.
580,11,45,2Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pRp3/2P1P3/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/R5K1 w - -',Of course that rock is giving him a terrible headache since he can't use 2 of his most important pieces now to defend those pawns. He will want to exchange it badly.
581,11,46,2Rad1,b'2rr2k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pRp3/2P1P3/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/3R2K1 b - -',I force him to do the rock exchange or to give me full control of d-file which will not help him at all.
582,11,47,2Rxd5,b'2r3k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1prp3/2P1P3/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/3R2K1 w - -',He goes for the exchanges of course but in doing so he has allowed me to have a passed pawn in the d-file while also keeping a solid pawn structure...
583,11,48,2exd5,b'2r3k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P5/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/3R2K1 b - -',So I capture with my e pawn. See the difference in pawns structures. He has 2 isolated pawns (those will be weaknesses during the rest of the middlegame and once I convert the game into endgame). My pawns are perfectly coordinated and my passed d-pawn is already in the enemy territory...
584,11,49,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P5/1P2Q2P/P4PP1/3R2K1 w - -',He of course will by all means try to keep me from advancing that passed pawn. But in doing so he failed to see that his unprotected queen is being x-rayed by my queen beyond his e pawn. I'll do all I can to disrupt his remaining decent pawn struct and to open up f-file now for me to start pressing on him.
585,11,50,2f4,b'3r2k1/4qp1p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P2P2/1P2Q2P/P5P1/3R2K1 b - f3',So I exploit the pinned pawn. He might advance it but then he would have to play f5 at some point to do a similar structure as mine in the kingside but with the pawns that were supposed to be used to protect his king. I would use the some of the pawns in my own castle to distroy it and in doing so shredding any defense he had left and then I would have a complete open area to do all kind of available tactics on a very weakly defended king of his maybe mating him or gaining material advantage in the process. He might feel compelled to defend the pawn.
586,11,51,2f6,b'3r2k1/4q2p/5pp1/p1pPp3/2P2P2/1P2Q2P/P5P1/3R2K1 w - -',So he does. But this will just enable my plans to open the f file.
587,11,52,2fxe5,b'3r2k1/4q2p/5pp1/p1pPP3/2P5/1P2Q2P/P5P1/3R2K1 b - -',I capture.
588,11,53,2fxe5,b'3r2k1/4q2p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P5/1P2Q2P/P5P1/3R2K1 w - -',He recaptures with pawn of course he can't afford exchanging queens on this position and with my material advantage and voilá... An open f file for me to start infiltrating the enemy territory. And the worst thing for him? 3 isolated pawns now.
589,11,54,2Qe4,b'3r2k1/4q2p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/3R2K1 b - -',I do a preventive maneouver to keep his pawn from advancing until I can deal with it.
590,11,55,2Kg7,b'3r4/4q1kp/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/3R2K1 w - -',He tries to bring his king into action.
591,11,56,2Rf1,b'3r4/4q1kp/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/5RK1 b - -',I seize the open file control.
592,11,57,2Rf8,b'5r2/4q1kp/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/5RK1 w - -',He won't allow it. But this will make his king move before a waste of time since whe will have to recapture with his own king for his queen is busy defending his e pawn.
593,11,58,3Rxf8,b'5R2/4q1kp/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/6K1 b - -',I go for exchanges.
594,11,59,3Kxf8,b'5k2/4q2p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P5P1/6K1 w - -',Recaptures...
595,11,60,3Kf2,b'5k2/4q2p/6p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P4KP1/8 b - -',And I bring my king into action. The idea is bringing my king to e4 so he can gang up with my queen against his e pawn. His king will be too far from the action or if he tries to come to the defense of that pawn will enable all sorts of tactics to win pawns and to force queen exchanges in an open area like this. Also I'm luring him to check my king if he does I protect mysef with my queen and then queens exchanges will be unavoidable for him.
596,11,61,3Qd6,b'5k2/7p/3q2p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q3/1P5P/P4KP1/8 w - -',There's not much he can do with his queen. I consider this a waste of time.
597,11,62,3g4,b'5k2/7p/3q2p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q1P1/1P5P/P4K2/8 b - g3',I'm not wasting time... I'm closing the back door for his queen to be completely unable to infiltrate my territory while my king goes for his pawn.
598,11,63,3Kg7,b'8/6kp/3q2p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q1P1/1P5P/P4K2/8 w - -',Not the best place he could put his king out of danger but then again there's not much places he can go so I don't blame him.
599,11,64,3Ke3,b'8/6kp/3q2p1/p1pPp3/2P1Q1P1/1P2K2P/P7/8 b - -',Almost there just moving my queen aside and then my king will be blocking the enemy pawn himself while my queen goes to infiltrate the enemy lines and makes way for my d-pawn to promote.
600,11,65,3h6,b'8/6k1/3q2pp/p1pPp3/2P1Q1P1/1P2K2P/P7/8 w - -',He tries to keep his only non-isolated pawns structure the most solid possible.
601,11,66,3Qf3,b'8/6k1/3q2pp/p1pPp3/2P3P1/1P2KQ1P/P7/8 b - -',My queen has now seized control of the open f file and makes way for my king to go attacking the pawn.
602,11,67,3g5,b'8/6k1/3q3p/p1pPp1p1/2P3P1/1P2KQ1P/P7/8 w - -',That was not the best now he'll allow my queen to go to f5 to attack the pawn while also keeping the greep on f-file.
603,11,68,3Ke4,b'8/6k1/3q3p/p1pPp1p1/2P1K1P1/1P3Q1P/P7/8 b - -',But first thing's first. My king blocks his pawn while I go for it.
604,11,69,3Kh8,b'7k/8/3q3p/p1pPp1p1/2P1K1P1/1P3Q1P/P7/8 w - -',There's nowhere he can escape now from my advance... he tries to lure my queen to check him on positions where she will be captured. Maybe works with a noob... not me.
605,11,70,3Qf5,b'7k/8/3q3p/p1pPpQp1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',And that's it King and queen are both attacking the pawn now and will take by the means of a check.
606,11,71,3Qb6,b'7k/8/1q5p/p1pPpQp1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',Guess he thought it was pointless to keep on defending it and start using his queen to infiltrate my own position via b4-a3. But he won't have time for that.
607,11,72,3Qxe5+,b'7k/8/1q5p/p1pPQ1p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',I capture and a check.
608,11,73,3Kh7,b'8/7k/1q5p/p1pPQ1p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',Not much place for him to go.
609,11,74,3Qe7+,b'8/4Q2k/1q5p/p1pP2p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',Yet another check.
610,11,75,3Kg8,b'6k1/4Q3/1q5p/p1pP2p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',Again not much place to escape. But here he'll allow me to do queen's exchange which of course I will do blinkless.
611,11,76,3Qe6+,b'6k1/8/1q2Q2p/p1pP2p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',Fork now he has to do queens exchange or lose his queen.
612,11,77,3Qxe6+,b'6k1/8/4q2p/p1pP2p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',He goes for the exchanges of course he has no choice.
613,11,78,4dxe6,b'6k1/8/4P2p/p1p3p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',I recapture.
614,11,79,4Kf8,b'5k2/8/4P2p/p1p3p1/2P1K1P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',He tries to bring his king to prevent my promotion.
615,11,80,4Kd5,b'5k2/8/4P2p/p1pK2p1/2P3P1/1P5P/P7/8 b - -',I think it was better for me to play Ke5 here. This way if he played Ke7 I would have played Kd5 and he would have to either go back to 8th rank or come to f6. f6 would lose to me playing Kd6 and then Kd7 and then just pushing my pawn to promotion. If he went to the eight rank I could safely capture his c pawn and then return again to defend e pawn. But I failed to see that one. I thought I had plenty advantage to forfeit my e pawn and capture c pawn to make way to my c pawn to promote while protecting it with my king from b7.
616,11,81,4Ke7,b'8/4k3/4P2p/p1pK2p1/2P3P1/1P5P/P7/8 w - -',He comes to e7 and then I remember my a-pawn had a free tempo adjusting move at my disposal which just came handy.
617,11,82,4a4,b'8/4k3/4P2p/p1pK2p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 b - a3',So I use it and now his turn to move. He has to go go back to 8th rank or allow a sooner promotion of my e pawn by playing Kf6...
618,11,83,4Ke8,b'4k3/8/4P2p/p1pK2p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',Of course he'll prefer to deal with a more delayed promotion.
619,11,84,4Kxc5,b'4k3/8/4P2p/p1K3p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',I capture the pawn.
620,11,85,4Ke7,b'8/4k3/4P2p/p1K3p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',He comes back to challenge my pawn.
621,11,86,4Kd5,b'8/4k3/4P2p/p2K2p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',And I just go back to defend it.
622,11,87,4Ke8,b'4k3/8/4P2p/p2K2p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',He has to fall back to 8th rank.
623,11,88,4Kd6,b'4k3/8/3KP2p/p5p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',And I make oposition so he keeps himself to the 8th rank.
624,11,89,4Kd8,b'3k4/8/3KP2p/p5p1/P1P3P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',Not much he can do.
625,11,90,4c5,b'3k4/8/3KP2p/p1P3p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',I could have played e7+ then he would play e8 I'd lose a time with my c pawn he would try to do any other legal move than Kf7 left like h5 and then hxg4. At some point he would have to play Kf7 then I would just push my king to d7 and promoting my e pawn would be unavoidable but that would make me chase his king to the h1 corner. So I'd rather keep the king to the 8th rank while I threat with promoting c pawn and then once his king went to c8 to block the promotion he wouldn't be able to prevent my e pawn promotion and it would be easier to corner him in a8.
626,11,91,4Ke8,b'4k3/8/3KP2p/p1P3p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',He remains in e file he can't just go to c file or e pawn would promoter egardlessly of whatever else he did.
627,11,92,4c6,b'4k3/8/2PKP2p/p5p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',Pushing the c-pawn.
628,11,93,4Kd8,b'3k4/8/2PKP2p/p5p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',Makes oposition. Whichever pawn I advance now will have to be blocked by the king by going to his rank and the other will promote.
629,11,94,4c7+,b'3k4/2P5/3KP2p/p5p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',So for me it will be easier to corner him at a8 and I force the king to come to c file or be mated in the next move.
630,11,95,4Kc8,b'2k5/2P5/3KP2p/p5p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',He must play that no choices or be mated next.
631,11,96,4e7,b'2k5/2P1P3/3K3p/p5p1/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',Now e will promote.
632,11,97,4h5,b'2k5/2P1P3/3K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',He tries to lose tempi.
633,11,98,5e8=Q+,b'2k1Q3/2P5/3K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',I promote check.
634,11,99,5Kb7,b'4Q3/1kP5/3K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',Only one place to escape.
635,11,100,5Qb8+,b'1Q6/1kP5/3K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',Yet another check. My queen king and pawn are now coordinated to push him to a6 with no other place to go.
636,11,101,5Ka6,b'1Q6/2P5/k2K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 w - -',Only move available.
637,11,102,5c8=B#,b'1QB5/8/k2K4/p5pp/P5P1/1P5P/8/8 b - -',And since he can't go anywhare I just need something to attack him. Could be a queen or in this case a bishop. Checkmate.

746,16,30,3Rc3,b'8/2p2k2/1p2p2p/3nP1p1/R5P1/P1r4P/5PKB/8 w - -',threatening both white's weak rook pawns I've also considered Ra5 to force the exchange of rooks and the resulting simplification but I disliked white's counter play on the opposed wing forcing my king to be fixed to it's defence after which the bishop greater mobility compared to that of my knight might became a decisive favouring factor for white
747,16,31,Kg6,b'8/R1p5/1p2p1kp/3nP1p1/6P1/P1r4P/5PKB/8 w - -',I needed to remove my king from the 2nd rank in order to be able to advance the c pawn at the same time this move allowed me a better defence of the king's wing

754,16,38,4Kg6,b'8/7R/1p2p1k1/3nP1P1/5P2/Prp3B1/6K1/8 w - -',now white will lose his rook Rh1 forced then I have c2 forcing white's reply Rc1 to which I'll answer with Rb1! then Rxc2 forced and Ne3+ with a double attack on king and rook wins the rook... the resulting technical endgame will pose no difficulties for black to win

806,20,1,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',4....Bb4  This move has some risks.  Yes it permits black to develop quickly and to fracture the queens-side for white but it also opens up attack points for white into black's position and without the king's bishop that black often needs especially when black's queen's bishop appears so walled in by its own pawns.  Not in this game however.
807,20,2,a3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/1bPP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White can stop the doubling of the pawns after 5....Bxc3+ with either 5. Qc2 or 5. Bd2.  But these alternatives may delay the deployment of white's pieces to the best squares.
808,20,3,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p1pp2pp/1p2pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',This bishop will come to dominate the board especially as it bears down on white's king-side.  My alternative to 7...b6 was 7....d6 8. Be2 Qe7 9. O-O Ne4 which was favorable to black in Adamik-Kaiser (Prague KS op-A 2007) or instead 7....d6 8. Be2 Qe7 9. O-O e5 which was also favorable to black in Nardmann-Garmann (Rheinland op 1997).  Still another option is from ECO and that is 7....c4 to establish a stonewall position with a possible triplet pawn for white?!!
809,20,4,Qe7,b'rn3rk1/pbppq1pp/1p2pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',There are a lot of choices here for black: ...Ne4 ...Qe8 ...Nc6 and ...d6.  I chose 9...Qe7 partly to vary from the main lines and partly to steer the game into a fairly clear division of deployment between black's coming king-side attack and white's queen-side assault.  Who will inflict damage first?
810,20,5,a5,b'rn3rk1/1bppq1pp/1p2pn2/p4p2/P1PP4/2PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - a6',It is possible to ignore 10. a4 since its aim is primarily to squeeze black's queen and rook on the a3-f8 diagonal with 11. Ba3.  But black has sufficient resources to defend against this and so I calculated that I had time for 10...a5. 
811,20,6,1Rb5,b'r4rk1/1bpnq1pp/1p1ppn2/pR3p2/P1PP4/B1PBPN2/5PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',13. Rb5 is an interesting idea and I have not seen it in any games so far where 12. Rb1 has been played.

Very late on in the game Glenda emerges from her defensive role much to the chagrin of my team captain Julia-Celine who just happened to be my opponent in this game.  Glenda was aided by a humble pawn which lured Julia's king into a mating net.  How did this happen?

It is often best to develop your knights before your bishops because it is easier to find the correct square for a knight than for a bishop in the opening. For instance white could move his knight to e2 (blocking in his queen and bishop) to h3 (placing it on the edge of the board) or to f3 - fighting for control of the centre of the board. The best square for the knight in this instance seems clear.

1004,28,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black drives white's knight away with d6. This is usual in the Petroff before capturing with ...Nxe4 since it avoids a number of traps that work in white's favour.
1005,28,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White move's his knight back out of danger to f3.

1007,28,8,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This move prevents playing ...Bg4 (pinning white's knight against the queen) but does nothing to help white's piece development. I think that d4 would have been better - providing space for development and maintaining a presence in the centre.
1008,28,9,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/8/4n3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not the best move since it blocks the bishop on f8 and doesn't really develop a piece. Black is still at least 2 moves from being able to castle. But it does set a trap for white...

Qe2 or Be2 would have been better here preventing the discovered check on black's next move.
1010,28,11,Nxc3+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/8/8/2n2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Ouch! Black takes white's pawn attacks white's queen and white's king is in check. White has only two moves and they are both bad: Qe2 (which loses the queen to Nxe2) or Be2 (which loses the queen to Nxd2).
1011,28,12,Be2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/8/8/2n2N1P/PP1PBPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Blocking the check on white's king.

1014,28,15,Be6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/3pb3/8/8/5N1P/PP1PBPP1/RNBK3R w kq -',Black now starts developing pieces.
1015,28,16,Nc3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/3pb3/8/8/2N2N1P/PP1PBPP1/R1BK3R b kq -',White also begins to develop by bringing our his knight - although now it is probably too late!
1016,28,17,Nc6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/8/8/2N2N1P/PP1PBPP1/R1BK3R w kq -',Another developing move. Black now has the option of castling queenside.
1017,28,18,1b3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/8/8/1PN2N1P/P2PBPP1/R1BK3R b kq -',Another pawn move from white. I think d4 would have been better here - that would get a pawn into the center and would also threaten 11. d5 forking blacks knight and bishop.

Black is now up on material and also has superior piece development to white. Blacks rooks are connected on the back rank (white's are still separated by his king) and black has control over the central black squares (white has no real presence in the centre of the board).

1062,30,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I bring out my bishop with Bb5 since his knight is on c6.  That is because I threaten to capture his knight with Bxc6 in this position.  However this was a mistake and I am no longer 100% focused on this game since I am already beginning to think about my appointment.  The situation only gets worse from here.
1063,30,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This mistake will allow him to capture a free pawn with Nxe5 after the exchange has occurred with Bxc6 and dxc6.

1065,30,7,Nc4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2pb1n2/8/2N1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I played Nc4 and threatened to capture his bishop with Nxd6 but this is another mistake.  Instead I should have protected my pawn on e4 with d3 but I am now thinking about what I must do to get organized and ready for the appointment.  Therefore it enables him to get a free pawn with Nxe4.  
1066,30,8,Qg4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2pb4/8/2N1n1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This was my biggest mistake.  Instead I should have castled immediately since I am in a safe place the kings side as opposed to bringing out my queen with Qg4.  However I figured that I would threaten to capture his pawn with Qxg7.  That is because I became more distracted and overwhelmed at this point then the rest of the game.  In fact I was just as preoccupied at this moment as August when my rating was below 900.  Therefore he is now able to capture my free queen with Bxg4. 
1067,30,9,Bxg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2pb4/8/2N1n1b1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Because he got my queen for free I resigned.  I learned perhaps the most important lesson from this game combined with many other games during the year.  When one has things to do and/or places to go the player should not play or resume playing chess until he or she has taken care of business.  That is because it is extremely likely that a person will not play well if he or she is preoccupied or overwhelmed during a chess game.

Why should I play like my opponent wants me to and defend for a long time? Then he would be in his element and I would be struggling. 

So from a psychological point of view I deceided to sacrifice a pawn of my own for an attack or force a closed type of system both of which seemed to take the attacking Marshall Attack player out of his comfort zone. "

I did however learn an important lesson from this game.  In fact I recently learned from Jack Stockel that even the best players make mistakes.  There was an OTB tournament between the second and forth best players in the world with ratings over 1800.  The second best player made an extremely serious and shocking blunder because he inadvertently sacked his queen by not being careful.  Therefore he lost and became the 4th best player and his rating was 2815.   I also learned that when a person is mad he or she should take a break from and not play chess until the player has recovered from anger and it could take hours to fully recover.  However one can't play chess well when he or she is angry.   "

However General rules are almost irrelevant because I am still a beginner.  Once the rating climbs over 1000 then I start to pay attention to chess basics.  Why do I not care too much about chess basics or general opening principles?  A grandmaster (tactical-abyss) told me that it is a bad idea to obsess over principles and rules.  He implied that there are occassions where you will loose by following chess basics.  Whereas there are other occassions where you will win by ignoring the basics.

Of course I did not know when an en-pessant was allowed until I saw something like axb4 e.p. in a different game.  Then I spoke to grege79 before he got rid of his account and he explained that en-pessants are allowed when you attack by pawn horizontally by moving your pawn in the first two spaces.
