37,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1. e4 is very logical.  In terms of space it occupies a center square (e4) and attacks another one (d5).  It also attacks f5 which can be considered part of the extended center.  In terms of development it opens the f1-a6 diagonal for the bishop and the d1-h5 diagonal for the queen.  Its drawbacks are few but they do exist.  Pawns cannot retreat so the e-pawn can never help secure the d4 or f4 squares.  Lastly the e-pawn itself may come under attack.

Just as people often trade a rook and pawn for two minor pieces (usually a mistake) so they'll trade two rooks for a queen (usually a mistake).  If the two rooks become coordinated they can over power the queen.

Chess is often about acquiring one type of advantage (such as one in space) and cashing it in for another one (e. g. pawn structure).  A lead in development can often lead to a material advantage as the defender gives up material in order to stave off an attack.  A lead in development is a temporary advantage and needs to be cashed in before it dissipates.  A spatial advantage tends to be more permament as long as you deny your opponent any freeing moves.  In this game white needed to play d4 in order to free his game and black tried to discourage it.  White finally played d4 but at the cost of a pawn.

White avoids the complicated variation here but now he gives me a winning position.

After Kh8 my plan was to charge the king with Qg6 threatening the h pawn.  Black is then left with few options.  Qh4 to defend the pawn gets Rf7 setting the mate.  Rg8 results in trading off the queens black losing the knight and my rooks making the black king dance.
After Kh7 Qh5 lines me up to Rf7 forking the black king and queen.  Qe6 or Qe8 prevents the fork but still leaves Rf7  Qxh6  Qg7  .  Lastly Kh8 also prevents the fork and the previous mate line but returns us to the other scenarios above."

In the opening active pieces don't matter as much because there are so many other pieces defending your position. Endgames are known for having a lot of loose pieces so piece activity is important.

And White's pawns are weak so I'm still likely to win one. I just shouldn't do it too soon.

534,16,32,3Bxf3,b'8/5p2/p5kp/1p6/6P1/5b2/PPPB3r/2K2R2 w - -',Bd2 was a blunder. White should've just played f4 and let me win his g4 pawn because he should be able to draw the game because of the opposite colored bishops but now he is losing because I have forced a bishop trade. The reason Black must take is because his g4 pawn is on a light square and can't be defended by his bishop the beauty of opposite colored bishop endings.

537,16,35,3Re6,b'8/5p2/p3r1kp/1p6/6P1/R7/PPPK4/8 w - -',Trading my a-pawn for his g-pawn is terrible because it leaves me with a weak b-pawn and his king is closer.
538,16,36,f6,b'8/8/p3rpkp/1p6/6P1/5R2/PPPK4/8 w - -',I safeguard my f-pawn before I proceed to attack with my king.

White could've stalled the game longer if he had taken my pawn on move 57 but with my extra rook and passed pawn winning would still be simple.
White's losing mistake this game was trying to stop me from advancing my pawn majority. He should've tried advancing his own majority on the queenside so that it would be a race to see whose majority advances faster. Remember that in endgames you MUST have active pieces not defensive pieces trying to stop a pawn majority."
549,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This game evolved from a rather rare line of the Sicilian to an extremely complex middlegame - and ended up with an ""objectively drawn"" endgame with opposite coloured Bishops. Unfortunately these kind of endgames are seldomly played out - because there are still a lot of tactics involved. But let´s start with the beginning... "
550,17,1,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Accelerated Dragon is not seen very much at master-level these days but it is still a fresh alternative to the bulk of theory of the more common Sicilian lines. GM Lothar Schmid played some interesting games with Black back in the Sixties and Seventies.
551,17,2,Be3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',We are at the crossroads of theory. White can opt for the Maroczy with 5. c4 which is linked with the English Opening or go for 5. Nc3 - the so-called Classical. This line can even lead to the more orthodox Dragon. Of course there are other moves and my opponent prefers one of these. But it just leads to a transposition in a few moves.
552,17,3,Bb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',(!) This is the critical test of the line according to a specialist in this opening GM Heine Nielsen. Black has no tricks with a Queen move to b6 and White prepares an attack on the King-side with f2-f3 Qd2 0-0-0 and h4. Black has other ways to go though and I chose to try a fianchetto of the other Bishop too. This leads to a very open game.
553,17,4,f4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pppbp/1pn2np1/8/3NPP2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ f3',"(!?) A very aggressive move! I had expected 9. f3 to limit the ""bite"" of the comming Bishop on b7. Black needs to react in the centre immediately and the time is just right since White hasn´t castled yet."

At the moment this is not so important since there are lots of attacking possibilities on both sides and in the centre. I must admit that I felt like walking into a battle-field more or less blinded by smoke from the gunfire :)
556,17,7,d5,b'r2q1rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/1N1pn3/4b3/1B2B3/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - d6',This is the kind of position I would hate to have in a blitz-game - even with a pawn up! Of course the Black d-pawn is strong but White has plenty of play around it and the final question could be: Which King is the safest. I decided to seek for simplifications instead.
557,17,8,Qh4,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p4p1/1N1pn3/3Bb2q/1B6/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',The obvious threat of Bh6 (hitting both Queen and King on same diagonal) gives Black time to put a Rook to a more active position - the cover of the d-pawn.

I must admit it took me ages to analyze it - but it leads almost forced to an endgame with opposite Bishops and Black a pawn up! Whites problem is the lack of communication of his light pieces and the threat of mate on the baseline. Without these tactics Black would have been out of ammo with only a handshake left...
560,17,11,Bxe5,b'6k1/p4p1p/1p4p1/3Bb3/8/8/PPP4P/1K6 w - -',After all the fighting this is an esthetically beautiful position: Two Bishops left right beside each other - and ready for a very different kind of game. I am no expert on endgames (but I love to play them!) and my opinion around here was: Probably a draw but with pawns on both sides Black has chances. First: Get a passed pawn on the king-side.
561,17,12,3Bg2,b'8/p6p/1p3k2/4bp2/6p1/2P4P/PP2K1B1/8 b - -',My opponent plays very skillfully in his attempt to take out the venom of the pawn-majority.
562,17,13,Kf4,b'8/p7/1p6/4bp1p/5kp1/2P4P/PP3KB1/8 w - -',Without the Bishops this would lead to an easy win but having the opposition of the Kings dosn´t do much here. It may sound strange but Blacks win is where his pawn-MINORITY is right now! That should explain the next moves.
563,17,14,Bd6,b'8/p7/1p1b4/5p1p/5kp1/2P4P/PP3K2/5B2 w - -',With the aim of changing to the more active diagonal a7-g1.

565,17,16,4Bd5+,b'8/8/1p6/p1bB4/2P1kp1p/1P4pP/P5K1/8 b - -',Controlling the white squares and the Black pawns on the Kingside it is hard to see how this can be anything but a draw. I decided to leave my Kingside-pawns to their own destiny and go for the other flank.
566,17,17,4Bc6,b'8/8/1pB5/p1b5/P1P2K1p/1k4pP/8/8 b - -',"(!) A crucial moment - and a great trap by White. The ""automatic"" move 46. - Kxc4?? will be refuted by 47. Kf3 followed by eg. Bb5 and a rock-solid draw since White has build a fortress on the light squares. Maybe I am wrong - but I don´t have Fritz to prove it... Nevertheless it became obvious that the c-pawn helps BLACK to win because it blocades Whites Bishop if the a-pawn goes. The next move is therefore both simple and decisive."
567,17,18,4g2,b'8/8/1pB5/p1b5/P1P2K1p/1k5P/6p1/8 w - -',White resigned. After 47. Bxg2 Kxa4 White cannot stop the a-pawn without giving up his Bishop. A very inspired game by both players if I may feel free to say so.

578,18,10,Kf8,b'r1bq1knr/pppp2p1/2n4p/2b4Q/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',If Black plays g6 trying to lure my queen away from his bishop then Qxg6  Kf8 Qf5  Ke8 Qh5  gets us back to where we started from except Black's g-pawn is missing. And if Black plays Ke7 instead of Kf8 then I can fork his king and his h8-rook with my queen.

Remember that 1. e4 robbed the d4 of any pawn support from the e-file.  White's contiuation has robbed the d4 square of any pawn support from the c-file as well.  White has his pawn duo but can it be maintained?
658,21,6,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/6p1/3p4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The most aggressive continuation.  An exchange of pawns would leave White with an isolated d-pawn.

Also notice that of the four central squares three of them are occupied by pawns.  Occupation is not the same as control.  The only central square avaible for the pieces is e4.  White has no pawn that can fight for control over e4 while black has two.

Bxf5 but this left him vulnerable on the light squares.  Black continued to pressure d4 until he was able to win it.  He then consolidated and developed often at white's expense.  He then used the open cifile to penetrate white's terriitory along yet another light square (c4).  White's remianing kingside pawns where crippled and unlimately had to fall.  If you're pawns are on dark squares keep your light square bishop.  And vice-versa.

720,23,15,cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/8/3p4/2BQ4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',It is clear that black will end up with an isolated d-pawn at the end of the exchanges on d5. The only question is how many pairs of pieces will leave the board before the pawn recaptures. With this move black keeps as much material as possible on the board. If he had played ...Nxd5 I would have replied 9. Bxd5. And if he then captured with the queen I would have traded queens as well.
721,23,16,Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/8/3p4/3Q4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Solohawk told me he expected Bd3 but I wanted to keep the isolated d-pawn under attack. Also it is pretty clear that black can't castle long so this keeps the bishop trained on the square the black king will end up on.

742,23,37,1Kg6,b'3r1b1r/pp3pp1/4b1kp/4Bq2/BQ3P2/8/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Again forced.
743,23,38,2Rxd8,b'3R1b1r/pp3pp1/4b1kp/4Bq2/BQ3P2/8/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',I should have bailed out of the attack with Qxb7. That would leave me up two pawns and the c pawn would be passed. That is exactly the type of position I like to have. All I would need to do is trade off the pieces and get to a won endgame. But instead I blunder with the text move.
744,23,39,2Bxb4,b'3R3r/pp3pp1/4b1kp/4Bq2/Bb3P2/8/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',And black is quick to remove my queen from the board.
745,23,40,2Rxh8,b'7R/pp3pp1/4b1kp/4Bq2/Bb3P2/8/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',I do get two rooks for the queen so material is about even but my pieces are not coordinating very well right now and black's queen could get very active. I consider black to be better here.
746,23,41,2Bxa2,b'7R/pp3pp1/6kp/4Bq2/Bb3P2/8/bPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Black picks up a stray pawn. Now if he could get white's b-pawn black's a-pawn would be passed.
747,23,42,2c3,b'7R/pp3pp1/6kp/4Bq2/Bb3P2/2P5/bP4PP/5RK1 b - -',I start to envision a plan to get back into the game. The black king and queen are lined up nicely. If I could get rook protection on the c2 square I could play Bc2 and pin the queen. I don't really want to chase black's dark bishop to a better square but I need to get my pawn off c2 to make way for the bishop.
748,23,43,2Bc5+,b'7R/pp3pp1/6kp/2b1Bq2/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5RK1 w - -',This is an excellent square for this bishop as it anchors the pawn on a7 and keeps white's king trapped in the corner.
749,23,44,2Kh1,b'7R/pp3pp1/6kp/2b1Bq2/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K b - -',"I considered Bd4 but didn't like the position after:
23. Bd4 Bxd4 
24. cxd4
Separating the queenside pawns makes it easier for black's queen to pick them off and I can't allow black to make the a and b-pawns passed. The problem with the text move is that it indirectly pins white's g-pawn. Moving the g-pawn would allow ...Qe4  followed by mate next move."
750,23,45,2f6,b'7R/pp4p1/5pkp/2b1Bq2/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K w - -',The bishop doesn't have very many safe places to go to but I think black should have considered the weakness of the a8-h1 diagonal and played either ...Bd5 or ...Qg4. If black focuses on the g2 square it will keep white tied up and passive.
751,23,46,2Bc7,b'7R/ppB3p1/5pkp/2b2q2/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K b - -',The best available square although the bishop seems out of play here.
752,23,47,2Kh5,b'7R/ppB3p1/5p1p/2b2q1k/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K w - -',This is a curious move. Hard to know what black's plan was but perhaps he was considering a pawn storm starting with ...g5.
753,23,48,2Rd8,b'3R4/ppB3p1/5p1p/2b2q1k/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K b - -',The rook needs to get back into the game and from here he can head to d2. That will give the light bishop the protection he needs to pick up the queen if the king and queen align again.
754,23,49,2a6,b'3R4/1pB3p1/p4p1p/2b2q1k/B4P2/2P5/bP4PP/5R1K w - -',Seems like a waste of time and I think black still should be activating the queen and light bishop.
755,23,50,2Bd1+,b'3R4/1pB3p1/p4p1p/2b2q1k/5P2/2P5/bP4PP/3B1R1K b - -',I considered Be8  but didn't see anything good in it so decided to give black some rope and see if he would hang himself. The second reason I played the bishop here is to get it to f3 where it helps protect against the mate threat on g2.
756,23,51,2Kg6,b'3R4/1pB3p1/p4pkp/2b2q2/5P2/2P5/bP4PP/3B1R1K w - -',This is what I was hoping for: the king and queen are aligned again.
757,23,52,2Rd2,b'8/1pB3p1/p4pkp/2b2q2/5P2/2P5/bP1R2PP/3B1R1K b - -',So I protect c2 and theaten to win the queen with Bc2 next move.
758,23,53,2Be3,b'8/1pB3p1/p4pkp/5q2/5P2/2P1b3/bP1R2PP/3B1R1K w - -',Black either doesn't see the threat or decides to get a rook and piece for his queen. But that is a bad bargain and this is the losing move. When the dust settles white will have a won endgame.
759,23,54,2Bc2,b'8/1pB3p1/p4pkp/5q2/5P2/2P1b3/bPBR2PP/5R1K b - -',As planned.
760,23,55,2Bxd2,b'8/1pB3p1/p4pkp/5q2/5P2/2P5/bPBb2PP/5R1K w - -',Black gets a rook.
761,23,56,2Bxf5+,b'8/1pB3p1/p4pkp/5B2/5P2/2P5/bP1b2PP/5R1K b - -',White gets the queen.
762,23,57,2Kxf5,b'8/1pB3p1/p4p1p/5k2/5P2/2P5/bP1b2PP/5R1K w - -',And black gets the piece but this leaves black down the exchange. With the two bishops black can put up some tough resistance but I think white should have a win in this position.
763,23,58,3Rd1,b'8/1pB3p1/p4p1p/5k2/5P2/2P5/bP1b2PP/3R3K b - -',The rook must get active.
764,23,59,3Bxf4,b'8/1pB3p1/p4p1p/5k2/5b2/2P5/bP4PP/3R3K w - -',This is a positional blunder that hastens the end for black. While black has both bishops he can control both colors. But by trading the dark bishops black loses the ability to control the dark squares. White's rook maintains the ability to control both colored squares and this will be crucial in the upcoming endgame.
765,23,60,3Bxf4,b'8/1p4p1/p4p1p/5k2/5B2/2P5/bP4PP/3R3K b - -',I am more than happy to trade off a pair of bishops as my rook will dominate his light bishop.
766,23,61,3Rd7,b'8/1p1R2p1/p4p1p/8/5k2/2P5/bP4PP/7K b - -',I give black a tough choice. If he protects the b-pawn I isolate his f and h-pawns from each other. If he protects the g-pawn I take the b-pawn which makes my c-pawn a passer.
767,23,62,3g6,b'8/1p1R4/p4ppp/8/5k2/2P5/bP4PP/7K w - -',Black lets me have a passed c-pawn.
768,23,63,Kg5,b'8/1R6/p4ppp/6k1/8/2P5/bP4PP/7K w - -',The king is going in the wrong direction. I am going to be pushing my passed c-pawn and black should have played ...Ke5 to head toward the c-file.
769,23,64,3Rb4,b'8/8/p4ppp/6k1/1R6/2P5/bP4PP/7K b - -',Threatening Ra4 to win the a-pawn but also protecting c4 so the c-pawn can step across it.
770,23,65,3Be6,b'8/8/p3bppp/6k1/1R6/2P5/1P4PP/7K w - -',Black can now protect the a-pawn from c8 while at the same time blockading the c-file.

772,23,67,3h5,b'8/8/p3bpp1/6kp/1RP5/8/1P4PP/7K w - -',Black has a 3-2 majority on the kingside so he can eventually create a passed pawn of his own but it will take too much time. The c-pawn is already on the move!
773,23,68,3c5,b'8/8/p3bpp1/2P3kp/1R6/8/1P4PP/7K b - -',From b4 the rook protected the pawn when it crossed a light square. The pawn doesn't need protection on dark squares and the rook just has to go to b6 to protect the pawn on the light c6 square. Black is really missing his dark bishop about now.

874,26,33,2Bxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1Q3pb1/p3p1pp/1p6/3B4/1B6/PP3PPP/R2R3K b - -',An extremely accurate move. It's the first move in initiating my tactic now I will win at least a piece.
875,26,34,2Bxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1Q3p2/p3p1pp/1p6/3b4/1B6/PP3PPP/R2R3K w - -',Black still thinks he is up a pawn for nothing but he cannot recover from the pin on the d-file.
876,26,35,2Qe4,b'r2q1rk1/5p2/p3p1pp/1p6/3bQ3/1B6/PP3PPP/R2R3K b - -',Now Black has to swallow his pride and give up his bishop which is his only chance to stay alive but his next greedy move gives me a much faster and prettier win.
877,26,36,2e5,b'r2q1rk1/5p2/p5pp/1p2p3/3bQ3/1B6/PP3PPP/R2R3K w - -',Black is determined to hold onto his bishop and keep his extra pawn but this is a horrible blunder because Black has overlooked the weakness of his king's position.
878,26,37,2Qxg6+,b'r2q1rk1/5p2/p5Qp/1p2p3/3b4/1B6/PP3PPP/R2R3K b - -',Now Black is totally lost. This was why h6 turned out to be a weakening move earlier.

898,27,18,1Na3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nBb1/NQ3NP1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',Dave is my friend.  He really let me have it for this move.  I don't know that I've ever seen an initial knight move to the a or h file that was annotated as smart.  My thoughts were of planning an attack up the a side at some point plus guarding my bishop with something other than my queen.  Not wise to guard more 2 pieces with one I'm told.
899,27,19,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nB2/NQ3bP1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',Dave takes the knight.  I'm not sure if he meant to concede the bishop or if my queen had slipped his mind.  We chat while playing and he questioned why I'd just give up a knight and allow him to pressure my rook.  He does this to play mind games sometimes so I just played dumb (it wasn't hard to do) and said oops.  So he took my knight.  I considered it a victory to get one of his bishops off the board.
900,27,20,1Qxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nB2/N4QP1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',Dave acted surprised.  I don't think he really was.

903,27,23,1Bxa3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/2B1nB2/b4QP1/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',Before dave made this move he told me he was going to 'school' me on how to break up my pawn structure.  He hadn't factored in my queen.  He may have been aware of her when he lost the first bishop but he wasnt aware on this one.  At this point I've lost both knights but the tradeoff for both his bishops would be huge for me.   Still it smells of a trap.  I hate jumping on a piece when it looks like I'm supposed to do it.
904,27,24,1Rxd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3R4/2B1nB2/b4QP1/PPP2P1P/2K4R b - -',I decided to pressure his queen.  I felt I had his black square bishop if I wanted it.  I'm sure this isn't a 'book' move but throwing Dave off his game is the only way I can gain advantage.
905,27,25,1Qf6,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/3R4/2B1nB2/b4QP1/PPP2P1P/2K4R w - -',This is when I knew Dave's attack wasn't the best put together.
906,27,26,1Qxa3,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/3R4/2B1nB2/Q5P1/PPP2P1P/2K4R b - -',Getting my queen out early turned out to be the smartest move I've made in this game.
907,27,27,1Nxf2,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/3R4/2B2B2/Q5P1/PPP2n1P/2K4R w - -',Nothing more than a pawn grab to me.  The pressure on my rook didn't bother me I was thinking e file the whole time.  This does restrict my king momentarily.
908,27,28,1Re1,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/3R4/2B2B2/Q5P1/PPP2n1P/2K1R3 b - -',This is probably the most comfortably I've ever owned the center of a chess game against Dave.  He has no bishops and even though I'm down a material point I sure don't feel like it.  I remind him of his 12. Bxa3 move that was going to wreck me.  I laugh.  I tell him thats what he gets for being an asshat.

916,27,36,1Rd4,b'r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/6q1/4n3/2BRn3/Q3B1P1/PPP4P/2K2R2 b - -',I concede the bishop.

918,27,38,2Bd5,b'r3r1k1/p1p2ppp/1p4q1/3Bn3/3Rn3/Q3B1P1/PPP4P/2K2R2 b - -',I'm thinking about Daves queen at this point trying to put something together to take some of his pieces and gain an advantage.  I've got firepower pointed at his king so I've got some room for error.
919,27,39,2c6,b'r3r1k1/p4ppp/1pp3q1/3Bn3/3Rn3/Q3B1P1/PPP4P/2K2R2 w - -',Dave takes away some of my room for error.

921,27,41,2Qe6,b'r3r1k1/p4ppp/1pp1q3/4n3/3RB3/Q3B1P1/PPP4P/2K2R2 w - -',he had to do something.  Right now I feel as if he's reacting to me.  It's a good feeling.

Actually no I don't.  I did it by capitalizing on Dave's mistakes.  Thats about the only way I can beat a player THAT superior to me.  He made the mistake early on and I didn't make mine until it was too late for him to do anything about it.  My little diatribe hasn't done this game the justice that it deserves as annotating doesn't show the comments left at the top of the page nor the instant messages that added the real flavor for the match.

994,29,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black also plays conservatively. After 2. Nf6 3. F4 3. d5 the game becomes a falkbeer counter gambit. 
995,29,2,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',Now white goes back to normal lines of the King's gaambit with Nc3 and Nc6 included.

1003,29,10,1Kf8,b'r2q1knr/1pp2pbp/p1np4/6pb/B2PPp2/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -', Trying to get out of the pin but paying a high price. Now white gets lots of compensation for the pawn and should have the superior game. Though really white's threat of d5 is very hard to face here and this was probably the best move.

This means that black will have to move his king and queen play f6 and then play f6xg5 to win the knight. These four moves will give white a dangerous attack. "

White only has to be careful that his knight doesn't get rounded up too soon meaning white has to play energetically. 
1012,29,19,1d5,b'r2q1k1r/2p1npb1/p1p3b1/3p2Np/2QPPBpP/2N5/PPP3P1/R4RK1 w - -',?! This Opens up the center when black isn't ready. Probably Bh6 intending Kg7 is better.

1025,30,5,exd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3P4/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',5. e5 isn't a good choice for me because after Black brings out his queen's bishop and plays e6 the game will transpose into a French game (e4 e6 d4 d5 e5 c5) but where Black's bishop isn't sitting passively on c8 blocked by the pawn on e6.
1026,30,6,Qxd5,b'r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Here I have an isolated d-pawn which can be a weakness but can also be a strength because it's controlling the centre unlike any of Black's pawns.
1027,30,7,Nf3,b'r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Be3 is less accurate because it doesn't help me clear the way for castling kingside and the bishop would also be passive unlike the knight which also adds control of the central e5 square.

1041,30,21,1Na4,b'r1b1k2r/1p2bppp/p3p3/7n/N7/3BB3/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b kq -',A miniature tactic to take one of Black's bishops leaving me with the strong bishop pair. Black cannot stop Nb6.

1048,30,28,2Nd5,b'7r/1p2k1pp/p2rp3/2Bn1p2/8/5B2/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Rd8 was the other move that defends the rook but it allows me to trade rooks and get my pawn back with Bxb7 giving me a good bishop vs. knight endgame where my bishop is stronger because there are pawns on both sides of the board and his knight is too slow to jump across the board.
1049,30,29,Rhd8,b'3r4/1p2k1pp/p2r4/2BR1p2/8/8/PP3PPP/6K1 w - -',I must be careful not to play the losing Rxf5?? because Ke6 relieves the pin on Black's rook while attacking my rook and I don't have time to get my rook back and defend my own rook so the endgame will be left with his strong mobile rook against my weaker bishop.
1050,30,30,2f4,b'3r4/1p2k1pp/p2r4/2BR1p2/5P2/8/PP4PP/6K1 b - f3',I prepare to bring my king to the centre for the ensuing endgame.
1051,30,31,2Re5+,b'3r4/1p4pp/p2rk3/2B1Rp2/5P2/8/PP4PP/6K1 b - -',Trading rooks is bad because after all the pieces are gone Black's king will be closer to the centre in the pure pawn endgame.
1052,30,32,3Re2,b'8/1p4pp/p2r1k2/5p2/5P2/8/PP2R1PP/6K1 b - -',Now I've reached a rook endgame which seems rather drawish. I play Re2 to stop Black's rook from coming to d2 where my queenside pawns are likely to die.
1053,30,33,3Rd4,b'8/1p4pp/p4k2/5p2/3r1P2/8/PP2R1PP/6K1 w - -',My opponent offered me a draw here. I believe that this position is a theoretical draw but I think I have slightly better winning chances because of my control of the e-file stopping Black's king from coming into play. And my coach also taught me a lot rook endgame strategies.
1054,30,34,h6,b'8/1p4p1/p4k1p/5p2/3r1P2/6P1/PP2R2P/6K1 w - -',Black cannot stop my control of the e-file with Re4 because it isolates his pawn and isolated pawns can be very weak in endgames especially pure pawn endgames.
1055,30,35,3Kf2,b'8/1p4p1/p4k1p/5p2/3r1P2/6P1/PP2RK1P/8 b - -',I'm getting my king to the centre.
1056,30,36,3Ke3,b'8/1p6/p4k1p/5pp1/3r1P2/4K1P1/PP2R2P/8 b - -',I was hoping Black would trade rooks here because his kingside pawns are weaker than my kingside chain and exploiting pawn weaknesses is easier in pure pawn endgames.
1057,30,37,3Rb4,b'8/1p6/p4k1p/5pp1/1r3P2/4K1P1/PP2R2P/8 w - -',I thought moving the rook along the d-file was better because it keeps my king from advancing to the centre. This may have been Black's losing error letting my king get to the centre.
1058,30,38,3Kd3,b'8/1p6/p4k1p/5p2/1r3Pp1/1P1K2P1/P3R2P/8 b - -',My king is active in the centre while Black's is stuck on the kingside. If he doesn't retreat his rook and let me onto the 4th rank I can play Kc3 forcing him to do so because Re4 like I said gives Black a weak isolated pawn.
1059,30,39,Rc6,b'8/1p6/p1r2k1p/5p2/3K1Pp1/1P4P1/P3R2P/8 w - -',Black can't do much in this position because his pieces aren't as active as mine. Active pieces are the most important thing in winning endgames.
1060,30,40,Rb6,b'8/1p6/pr3k1p/3K1p2/5Pp1/1P4P1/P3R2P/8 w - -',As I continue to improve my position all Black can do is pointlessly maneuver pieces.

1064,30,44,4Ke6,b'8/6k1/pR2K2p/5p2/5Pp1/1P4P1/r6P/8 b - -',The most important thing in endgames is to have active pieces. Black's king is inactively placed in the corner while my king and rook are actively directed toward Black's weak kingside pawns.
1065,30,45,4a5,b'8/6k1/1R2K2p/p4p2/5Pp1/1P4P1/r6P/8 w - -',Kg6 is dubious because Ke5  takes his king away from his pawn and results in the same position as the actual game but where Black hasn't played a5.
1066,30,46,Rxh2,b'8/6k1/1R6/p5Kp/5Pp1/1P4P1/7r/8 w - -',Black offered me a draw again but this time my position is winning because of Black's weak king and my actively placed pieces.

Nf3 d6 the queen knight is often developed via d7 rather than c6 where it is in this game.  3. ...exd4 is the standard continuation often leading to the two knights defense.
1088,32,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black does not have time for this.  The position is different from a Ruy Lopez because the moves d4 and d6 have already been played.
1089,32,3,dxe5,b'r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1pp4/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Now white has won a pawn.

1091,32,5,h3,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1pb4/8/4P1b1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So white would like to eliminate one of them.
1092,32,6,Bb4+,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/8/1b2P1b1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This isn't a good idea because white can now force the trade of at least one of the bishops.  Notice that the move actually helps white complete his development.  8. ...Bh4 would've been better.  8. ...Bxf3 9. Qxf3 would also be good for white.
1093,32,7,1Nbxd2,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/8/4P1b1/5N1P/PPPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Look at the position after white's 8th move and compare it to this one.  After white's 8th move it is black's turn to move.  What has happened between then and now?  The dark square bishop's have been removed (robbing black of the two bishops) and the white knight has moved from b1 to d2.  Black has accelerated white's development and done nothing about his own.  Always be suspicious about giving check especially with a piece that's already been developed.  Ask yourself whether the move helps you opponent's development.
1094,32,8,1Qe2,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/7b/4P3/5N1P/PPPNQPP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',White is about to complete his development has an extra pawn and I haven't even mentioned black's crippled queenside pawns.  The only way to compensate for such structual flaws is to attack.  White's advantage is most pronounced in the endgame so white will generally encourage any further reduction in material.
1095,32,9,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/p1p2n2/7b/4P1P1/5N1P/PPPNQP2/2KR3R b - g3',Now that white knows where black's king lives it is time to storm the castle.

1099,32,13,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/2p2ppp/p1p2q2/8/4P1b1/4QN2/PPPN1P2/2K3RR w - -',A nice defensive try.  It is often possible to meet an attack (such as the one on black's g4 bishop) with a counter attack (in this case against b2).
1100,32,14,1Qd4,b'1r3rk1/2p2ppp/p1p2q2/8/3QP1b1/5N2/PPPN1P2/2K3RR b - -',Again white would encourage the trade of the queens in order to reach a winning ending.

Nc3 white has exchanged a side pawn for a black central pawn (good for white) and is ahead in development by gaining tempo against the black queen (also good for white).
1106,33,2,e3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But now it is white who misplays the opening by failing to develop with tempo against the black queen. 3. e3 also blocks in white's dark bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.
1107,33,3,e5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A good move: gaining space and keeping both diagonals open for the bishops to develop.

And for what reason? To ""threaten"" the bishop on d6? For white to trade a knight he has invested three tempos in for black's bad bishop which has only moved once seems foolish. And black would get to recapture with the c pawn and atone for his mistake on move 1 by getting his second central pawn back."

To waste time repositioning the queen to the square the bishop needs to go to seems incredibly wrong. Can black be thinking of a fianchetto with the light bishop? But if so why move the queen at all? Very curious this is.

On the one hand it doesn't help the light bishop get developed and completing development should be black's highest priority. On the other hand it may induce white to trade the knight for the Bd6 which I have pointed out would be good for black. Besides the reasons I gave on move 7 there is now another reason 11. Nxd6 cxd6 would be good for black. With white's queen on c2 black can play ...Rac8 and take control of the newly opened c-file with tempo against white's queen. If white refuses to trade and plays the knight back to c3 (the only safe square) he is admitting his knight sortie was ill-advised.
1122,33,18,1Nxd6,b'r1b2rk1/1ppq1ppp/p1nN1n2/4p3/8/PP2P1N1/2QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',White does win the two bishops but black is still ahead in development and now has a chance to repair the damage to his pawn structure caused by his first move.

Not only does he allow white to keep a central pawn majority but he forgoes a chance to open and then control the c-file. In black's defense this move does get his queen out of the way of the bishop in case he doesn't want to fianchetto.

Now that the g2 pawn is attacked white can't develop his light bishop right away. A problem with black's plan is that white can simply play 14. e4 and chase the bishop back.

In this game Boris Spassky demonstrates his ability to sacrifice accurately against Bent Larsen. It also shows how powerful a passed pawn can be.

1.b3: 

A typical Larsen move. Larsen was an adventerous player who allways like to play for wins. Larsen was also famous for this opening move b3 which was rightfully named after him (Nimzovich-Larsen attack). However this move is considered ""less perfect"" compared to the ""perfect five"" (e4 d4 c4 Nf3 and g3). One might ask why as g3 and b3 are very alike but there are two differences between them:

1. b3 followed by Bb2 does not help K-side castling where as g3 and bg2 does.
2. To enhance the power of the bishop on b2 white will probably play f4 which weakens the K-side but to enhance the power of a bishop on g2 white can play c4 which doesn't weaken the K-side."

1309,39,4,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq c3',White seizes control of d5 with a good move. The other option was e4 but after 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 the bishop on b2 is out of action and black has an easy game.
1310,39,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Simple developing.
1311,39,6,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P3N2/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',A interesting move by Larsen. White dares the e pawn to advance which gains time but as compensation white gets full control of the a1 h8 diagonal. The idea behind this move is similar to the Alekhine Defence (1.e4 Nf6).
1312,39,7,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2P1p3/1P3N2/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',What I said before about gaining time. 
1313,39,8,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2PNp3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Ng5 risks discovered attacks if the Nf6 moves. Therefore the knight will have to be protected by a pawn wasting more time.
1314,39,9,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2PNp3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',A good move from Spassky. Black forces white to waste more time by moving the knight again.
1315,39,10,Nxc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',The only logical move. Nf5 is met with 6...d5 with a massive centre. (If 7.Nxg7 then Kf8 and the Knight is trapped. 
1316,39,11,dxc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',An excellent move. Usually it is best to caputre towards the centre but Spassky accurately analyses that white is behind in development and with this move he opens the diagonal for his other bishop to come in and help an attack.
1317,39,12,e3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White must get the bishop out to be able to castle.
1318,39,13,Bf5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Developing.
1319,39,14,Qc2,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',An interesting move. The queen now puts pressure on the e-pawn and prevents the e pawn from moving as Qxf5 wins material (all this will come clear on whites 10th move). However this does nothing to help the K-side development and perhaps Be2 0-0 and then this move is better.
1320,39,15,Qe7,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Black bolsters his e-pawn as it is a real hazard for white. He also prepares Q-side castling which is a good idea as the Bb2 could be dangerous if he castles K-side.
1321,39,16,Be2,b'r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQPBPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Preparing castling.
1322,39,17,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQPBPPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Simple castling one might think but watch the Rook on the d file and the pawn on d2...
1323,39,18,1f4,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1pP2/1P2P3/PBQPB1PP/RN2K2R b KQ f3',As said in my first comment white this move is usually played to enhance white's bishop. This is also the main idea behind Larsen's Qc2 move as exf en passant Qxf5 wins. However white should have played Bxf6 exchanging blacks knight because the following move puts him in trouble...
1324,39,19,1Ng4,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPn1/1P2P3/PBQPB1PP/RN2K2R w KQ -',! An excellent move by Spassky which prevents castling! If 11. 0-0 then Rxd2! wins material as Qxd2 loses to Bxe3  forking the queen and king and winning Two pawns and a queen for a rook and bishop. Furthermore Black threatens Qh4  with a massive attack.
1325,39,20,1g3,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPn1/1P2P1P1/PBQPB2P/RN2K2R b KQ -',The queen must be kept out of h4 at all costs.
1326,39,21,1h5,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b1p/2P1pPn1/1P2P1P1/PBQPB2P/RN2K2R w KQ h6',The beginning of one of the greatest attacks in history. Black plans to play h4 with a massive attack on white's k side.
1327,39,22,1h3,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b1p/2P1pPn1/1P2P1PP/PBQPB3/RN2K2R b KQ -',A plausible try by Larsen to move the Knight from g4 but the h pawn is too strong.
1328,39,23,1h4,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPnp/1P2P1PP/PBQPB3/RN2K2R w KQ -',! Spassky makes this excellent move sacrificing a piece in order for the H-pawn to penetrate the white forces.
1329,39,24,1hxg4,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPPp/1P2P1P1/PBQPB3/RN2K2R b KQ -',Probably the best attempt to keep white alive. If 13.Bxg4 Bxg4 14.hxg is similar to the game continuation.
1330,39,25,1hxg3,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P1p1/PBQPB3/RN2K2R w KQ -',! Spassky throw's another piece into the line of fire in order for his pawn to reach home. Unfortunately Larsen analyses correctly and see's that 14.Rxh8 Rxh8 15.gxf is bad for white as Blacks domination of the H file will bring about a win. (Qh4 etc)
1331,39,26,1Rg1,b'2kr3r/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P1p1/PBQPB3/RN2K1R1 b Q -',This is a tricky move by Larsen as the deadly Qh4 can now be met with Rg2! when the black pawn is more of a hazard for black.
1332,39,27,1Rh1,b'2kr4/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P1p1/PBQPB3/RN2K1Rr w Q -',!! Great move by Spassky already a piece for a pawn behind he generously throws a rook into the heap in order for the g pawn to gain time.
1333,39,28,1Rxh1,b'2kr4/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P1p1/PBQPB3/RN2K2R b Q -',Forced as Kf1? loses to Rxg1 Kxg1 and Qh4.
1334,39,29,1g2,b'2kr4/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P3/PBQPB1p1/RN2K2R w Q -',The reason for the rook sacrifice. The pawn has now gained momentum and cannot be stopped.
1335,39,30,1Rf1,b'2kr4/ppp1qpp1/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPP1/1P2P3/PBQPB1p1/RN2KR2 b Q -',"Yes yes I can hear you right now ""What about Rg1?"" That was my first reaction to this move but it seems that Rg1 would lose even faster than this move. If 15. Rg1 then Qh4 ! 16.Kd1 Qh1! and white is lost as the pawn is unstoppable."

An excellent game by Spassky who shows how powerful a passed pawn can be in only 17 moves!"
