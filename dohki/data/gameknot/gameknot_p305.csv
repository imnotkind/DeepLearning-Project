78,2,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Oh no......another Dutch player. As I really hate playing against the Dutch I decide to try to get black out of his book as quickly as possible. Once I play 2.c4 to gain space and clear a square for my Nb1 I have every intention of avoiding main lines.
79,2,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Interesting. I usually run across Dutch players who follow the Leningrad Variation (1.d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7). 2...e6 is one of variants of another main line (whose name escapes me) which is 1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 e6 4.Bg2 (with altered move order). Black is obviously fluent in this opening so I made the decision to attempt to throw him off starting on my 4th move. My intent is to develop my queen's knight and get my dark squared bishop to g5 in an attempt to start a pre-emptive attack. The problem with that idea is that I plan on totally disregarding the concept of getting my light squared bishop on it's natural long diagonal. My personal preference is that IF I'm going to fianchetto a bishop it is going to be aiming AT the enemy king not away from it. That is the main reason for my distaste of playing against the Dutch. I'm sure I'll pay for admitting that:)
80,2,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black sticks with his plan by developing and preparing to castle.
81,2,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',?! Probably not the most sound move but as I said my intent was to get out of what was surely my opponent's preferred line.
82,2,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',"I would give black the slight edge here. He has developed nicely and is prepared to castle. His pin of my knight and kingside space make up for the ""weakness"" of what I assume will be his castled position."
83,2,6,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',An interesting idea. This move was made for three reasons - 1) my fear of having doubled pawns on the c file after Bb4xNc3 2) to have the ability to castle long (and QUICK if needed) and 3) my queen is now aimed at the side black will probably castle on and will be the anchor of my queenside expansion.
84,2,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Black has now secured his king and is ready for typical Dutch style development on the queenside.
85,2,8,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/P1N5/1PQ1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ -',?! Another somewhat dubious move. As the threat against his bishop must be dealt with black must decide between three different options A) trade his bishop for my knight B) retreat the bishop to a5 (which is horrible because of 7.b4 Bb6 8.c5) or C) retreat the bishop back to e7 to interpose the pin.
86,2,9,Be7,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/P1N5/1PQ1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ -',Black chooses wisely. However white now gains a little time to get developed.

95,2,18,1Bd3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp3pp/3p1b2/3Ppb2/2P1N3/P2B4/1PQ2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',! No problem. My light squared bishop gets a chance to make up for his earlier slow play by getting to where he should have been in the first place and interposes the pin.

114,2,37,2Rxc7,b'r5qk/p1R4n/3p4/1p1Pp2Q/2P5/P5P1/1P4rP/1K3R2 b - -',I had calculated the danger of getting involved in pawn exchanges on the b and c files so I simply make room for my Rf1 to move to f7. The grabbing of black's c pawn was inconsequential but satisfying all the same.

With this queen sac black now hopes to storm the queenside if he can only stave off white's attack on his weakened kingside! Use the 'Flip the board' option to see this position from both points of view. Wild stuff!
255,6,28,Nd5+,b'r4r1k/pp3p2/3P2p1/2nnP1BN/7Q/1P2KP2/1P5P/8 w - -',And black starts attacking in earnest.

The offensive properties of the king are sometimes forgotten. If a queen=9 a rook=5 a bishop=3.5 a knight=3 and pawns=1 point a king can be considered a '5' and should be used when needed to disrupt an enemy's plan. Brave play by Bronstein.
257,6,30,2Ne6+,b'r4r1k/pp3p2/3Pn1p1/3nP1BN/3K3Q/1P3P2/1P5P/8 w - -',As one of the knights is going to fall anyway black uses this check to retreat forces back towards the action. His plan now should be to secure his king and the real estate directly around it.

259,6,32,3Nf6+,b'r4r1k/pp3p2/3P1Np1/3KP1n1/7Q/1P3P2/1P5P/8 b - -',Correct. White sees that the black knight on g5 is toast anyway so he is in no hurry to snag it just yet. Better to start positioning the enemy king where he is most vulnerable.
260,6,33,Rfd8,b'r2r4/pp3pk1/3P1Np1/3KP1Q1/8/1P3P2/1P5P/8 w - -',Black is now down severely on material and tempo. His saving grace is that white is EXTREMELY short on his clock (I couldn't find out how short but reportedly the next 10 moves by Bronstein were played VERY rapidly).

267,6,40,3Qd7+,b'8/1p1Q2k1/r7/p2K4/6p1/1P3P2/1P5P/8 b - -',! A check that threatens both b7 and g4 as well.
268,6,41,4Qxb7,b'8/1Q6/r6k/p2K4/6p1/1P3P2/1P5P/8 b - -',Correct idea. White knows he is on cruise control and should win. Removing ANY chance of a black pawn push while still safe from receiving a check is just good solid patient chess.
269,6,42,4f4,b'8/1Q6/6rk/p2K4/5Pp1/1P6/1P5P/8 b - -',And Ljubojevic resigns as his g pawn will never reach it's goal because of white's pawn on h2. His a pawn is worthless as well. In a game of queen vs. rook he may have some play but now because white's f pawn has entered the picture he knows he can't defend on that many fronts. A wonderful game and a beautiful example of the concept of TIME being used in a mating attack. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas

494,14,35,3a4,b'Q7/8/2p1rk1p/8/P5PK/2P1r3/2P4P/8 b - a3',And Tal starts the run towards promotion.

497,14,38,4Qxe3+,b'8/P7/2p4p/8/6PK/2P1Qk2/2P1r2P/8 b - -',And black resigned as he can't stop the a pawn from promoting. When it comes to sacrifices no one could match Tal! Both rook sacrifices in this game were genius (especially the first one on move 15). Because of inspiring play like this Tal went on to win the World Championship from Botvinnik four years later (he turned right around and lost it to Botvinnik a year after that). While his reign at the top may have been short Tal continued to be considered an upper echelon GM some 30 years after he lost the title. And I wasn't kidding around with drinking jokes - Tal was a chain smoking booze lover (who allegedly got hooked on morphine as well). The toll that his vices took on his body was severe. I guess that his addictions were the great equalizer with the rest of us. He was only a man - but his chess was truly magic. I hope you have enjoyed:) - Thomas
498,15,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is a very instructional positional game played by a young Gary Kasparov and a former world champion Petrosian who is reduced to a state of complete paralysis.
499,15,1,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A useful check Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle.
500,15,2,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Objectively speaking not the most ambitious move in Bogo theory.  Here 4. Nbd2 is considered to be stronger these days but Kasparov's reasoning is that Black is going to play ...d5 at some point and the exchange of dark-squared bishops will leave Black with weakness on the dark squares.  Also the remaining Black light-squared bishop will be bad as it is hemmed in by its own central pawns.
501,15,3,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black is in no hurry to exchange on d2 as after 4. Qxd2 d5 5. Nc3 White keeps a slight edge.  Alternatively if White tries to act in the center now Black is able to force off another set of pieces after 4...Bxc3 5. Bxc3 Ne4.  As a general rule the side with less space will seek exchanges to make more room for his pieces.
502,15,4,g3,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White's pressure will be based around the influence of the g2 Bishop.
503,15,5,Bxd2+,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1bPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',The Bishop has served it's purpose of restraining White's expansion in the center so Petrosian decides to exchange it off.
504,15,6,d5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/RN2K2R w KQ d6',Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.
505,15,7,dxc4,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/RN3RK1 w - -',This move gets a ?! dubious mark as Black is in too much of a hurry to simplify.  It is far better to keep a barrier to the g2 Bishop with 8...Rd8 9. Qc2 Nc6 10. cd ed 11. Nc3 Bg4 when Black would have active pieces to compensate for his slightly weak pawn structure on the Queenside.  The White Bishop which becomes a terror in the game continuation would have been kept under better control.
506,15,8,Na3,b'rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',An excellent idea!!  White intends to recapture on c4 with his Queen's Knight rather than lose time with 9. Ne5 c5 when Black has a fighting chance as White still has two pieces sleeping on the Queenside.
507,15,9,c5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/2p5/2pP4/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 w - c6',The elimination of White's strong central pawn will open a highway into the Black position.
508,15,10,1dxc5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/2P5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',The correct capture as it will lure the Black Queen to a square where it can be the subject of tempo gaining attacks by the White pieces.
509,15,11,1Rac1,b'rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',White has the initiative due to his more active pieces.
510,15,12,1Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2q5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black can't defend the c4 pawn with b5 as ...Nd4 will win the pawn back and give White a better game.
511,15,13,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2n1pn2/8/2N5/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',Removing the Queen from the line of fire but the best move was 12...Rd8.
512,15,14,1Nfe5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2n1pn2/4N3/2N5/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',Now Black is unable to solve the fundamental problem of developing the c8 Bishop without giving White strong pressure on the b7 pawn.
513,15,15,1Nxe5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4N3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',White is in absolute control of the c-file.  Black now can't play 14...Be7 clearing a spot for the a-rook as 15. Rc7 is crushing.
514,15,16,1Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4p3/3nN3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',Petrosian offers a pawn to accelerate his development.  After 15. Bxd5? exd5 16. Qxd5 Bh3 17. Rd1 Rfd8 all of Black's pieces come to life and the c8 bishop is the best piece on the board and Black's rooks enjoy open lines.
515,15,17,1Rfd1,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4p3/3nN3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2RR2K1 b - -',White's pieces are taking up premium squares.
516,15,18,1Qa5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/1n2p3/Q3N3/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/2RR2K1 b - -',Exclam.  The sublety behind this move is that if now 16...f6 attempting to drive away the e5 Knight then 17. Nc4 Nxc4 18. Rxc4 and Black cannot prevent a rook invasion of the 7th rank as the White Queen is controlling c7.
517,15,19,1g6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qp1p/1n2p1p1/Q3N3/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/2RR2K1 w - -',A little breathing room please!

The point is that 17...Rd8 is met with 18. Qc5! Qxc5 19. Rxd8  Qf8 20. Rxf8  and 21. Rc7 and the pawns on the second rank will be massacred by the White rook.  If White had hesitated with a natural move like 17. e4 Black can ease his task by 17...Rd8 as 18. Qc5?? is met by Rxd1  losing the Queen.
519,15,21,1e4,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qp1p/4p1p1/Q2nN3/4P3/3R2P1/PP3PBP/2R3K1 b - e3',The White bishop is now locked in however chess is a game of give and take.  The Knight on d5 blocks White's pressure down the d-file and guards against a Rook invasion on c7.  Overall the White pieces are doing fine with this move.
520,15,22,1Nb6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qp1p/1n2p1p1/Q3N3/4P3/3R2P1/PP3PBP/2R3K1 w - -',18...Nf6 19. Rc7!

True to his intentions Alekhine had those drinks afterwards and I'm sure he had a good laugh at Reti's expense. It simply blows my mind how deep into a position these top level GM's can see. Supposedly Alekhine pictured this situation after his 32nd move (eight moves deep). While analyzing eight moves deep is certainly strong it is not unheard of even for strong club level players. The thing is how many club players could make that calculation with SO MANY tactical options available? It's one thing to count squares while you are pushing a passed pawn up the a file while your opponent pushes his passed pawn down the h file but the calculation required in this game was much much deeper (and far more beautiful). I hope you have enjoyed this game:) - Thomas

Second g6 is the right move now as it cancels the threat at f7 and the bishop does guard the h6 knight.

Black has Nf5 stopping both threats although this leads to a little skewer giving back the material still leaves black up a piece some consolidating moves and it's an easy victory.

My queen is protected by bishop on g5. His bishop on c7 was obstacle. But when he captured my knight it was checkmate. This was a good game on my part. But black also made some bad moves by exposing his power pieces too soon. But in whatever situation developing pieces early makes attacking late much more effective and gives you much more options too. Obviously everyone knows that but way too often I don't go by that. The lure of attacking is too much sometimes. this game is a way to remind myself to resist it and diligently develop pieces.

I think that h6 may be better. Then followed by f5 to try and gain space in the centre and kingside. The immediate f5 can be answered by Bc4  and then Ng5 which is a little awkward for black. Hg first prevents the Ng5 and after Bc4  the king can go to h7.

Deep Blue seemed a little confused at first and played a few innacurate and weakening moves but it came right back into the game with later moves that no one would have foreseen.  Kasparov kept his nerve and still held a small advantage.  However the lead Kasparov muttered to himself after not making the best move.  With the tension rising Deep Blue was provoked into an unsound attack that weakened its position still further but such was the ferocity of its assault that it took all of Kasparov's tactical skill to defeat the computer.  Although ahead on material Deep Blue was strategically lost after the queens were exchanged and the world champion methodically wrapped up the endgame.  Hope you have fun looking through this game I will be showing Game 2 between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue tommorow.  They played a 6 game series of flawless playing.

The fact that the bishop will enter the game was enough of a reason for white to resign. Black will place the bishop on f5 begin pushing the centre pawns and back them up with the rook.

The problem with the text move is that black has already achieved his strategic opening goal. In an e4 opening black is trying to get in d5 to attack white's center and liquidate the e4 pawn. On move 4 black has already equalized.
1008,33,3,d3,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And it is now black that has the better center pawn (on the 4th rank while white's center pawn is on the 3rd). I will try to exploit this space advantage while avoiding trades that will ease white's cramped position.

1012,33,7,Nh4,b'2kr1bnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/6bN/2PP4/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',Avoiding the previous lines but putting the knight out of play. White does offer to trade his bad bishop for black's good bishop. And trades will lessen the value of black's space advantage.
1013,33,8,Bxe2,b'2kr1bnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/7N/2PP4/PP2bPPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Nevertheless I trade expecting white will not want to drop the pawn and will recapture with the king. White can still castle by hand after that but it takes time and time is precious in a semi-open opening.
1014,33,9,Qxe2,b'2kr1bnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/7N/2PP4/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',And quite surprisingly white sacrifices the d pawn. I don't see much compensation for it but I'm sure white had some reason for doing it.

Now that the queens are off it is not as important to castle. There is still plenty of firepower on the board but if a pair of rooks go away the centralized white king will be better in the coming endgame than my king over in the corner.
1022,33,17,1g6,b'1k4nr/ppp1bp2/2n3p1/4pN1p/8/2PrB3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',I don't fear Nxe7 as ...Ngxe7 will complete my development and allow me to double rooks on the d file. True the pawn structure favors bishops over knights but sometimes you have to accept a trade-off. I would rather lose my bishop and activate my rooks to take advantage of my extra pawn.
1023,33,18,1Nxe7,b'1k4nr/ppp1Np2/2n3p1/4p2p/8/2PrB3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',And white no doubt thinks his bishop will be superior to my minor pieces in the endgame.

The problem with this is that after he trades knights he will win the e pawn and actually be a pawn to the good. I think it would have been better to play Nxe5 and maintain a material advantage.
1033,33,28,2Nd7+,b'1k5r/p1pNn3/1pn3p1/7p/8/2P1p3/PP3PPP/2KR4 b - -',Except that he doesn't play to win the pawn he plays to check my king. And for what purpose? I don't see it but I'm sure he had an idea.
1034,33,29,2Kc8,b'2k4r/p1pNn3/1pn3p1/7p/8/2P1p3/PP3PPP/2KR4 w - -',And now my king is just as centralized as white's and I add another defender to the d8 square.
1035,33,30,2fxe3,b'2k4r/p1pNn3/1pn3p1/7p/8/2P1P3/PP4PP/2KR4 b - -',White gets the e pawn but has given up a piece for it. Now my material advantage should begin to tell.

1039,33,34,2b4,b'3k4/2p1n3/1pn3p1/7p/1P6/2P1P3/P5PP/2K5 b - b3',As we enter the endgame I take a look at the board and decide where I want my pieces to be. Obviously the e pawn must be blockaded (and that is best done with a knight). The other striking feature of the position is that if I arrange my knights so they defend each other and can't be attacked by a pawn they can never be forced to move (the white king can't take either one). With these points in mind I decide I want knights on e5 and c6. The e5 knight will protect the base of the kingside pawn chain on g6. The only problem is that I need to make sure that once I get a knight to c6 white can't play b5 and kick at it. But I have an idea of how to do that.
1040,33,35,2Ne5,b'3k4/2p1n3/1p4p1/4n2p/1P6/2P1P3/P5PP/2K5 w - -',Step one: blockade the passed e pawn and protect the kingside pawn chain.

1042,33,37,2c5,b'3k4/4n3/1p4p1/2p1n2p/1P6/2P1P3/P2K2PP/8 w - c6',Hoping for bxc5 when white can no longer control the c6 square. What would I have done if white had pushed b5? I don't know but I'm sure I would have found a way for my knights to control the game.
1043,33,38,2bxc5,b'3k4/4n3/1p4p1/2P1n2p/8/2P1P3/P2K2PP/8 b - -',And I get my wish as white relinquishes control of c6.
1044,33,39,2b5,b'3k4/4n3/6p1/1pP1n2p/8/2P1P3/P2K2PP/8 w - -',And now the e5 knight has a square to jump to (c4) if he needs an outpost later in the game.

This game shows Reti's hypermodern play against a semi-slav type setup by Black.  The latent power of the White position is shown when Reti opens the position to unleash the power of the double fianchettoed bishops.  Bogoljubov tries to extricate himself tactically however his position is demolished by a beautiful combination.

1111,36,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French Defence.  The pawn on e6 will support a pawn on d5.

1113,36,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Developing the knight and possibly preparing an eventual Bg5.
1114,36,4,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Although this move seems strange at first it's the only real spot for the knight since it could be kicked out of the f6 square after white plays e5.  The knight will soon move to g6 freeing up black's dark-square bishop.

First it expands on the queenside.  Second it gives black's light-square bishop room to develop.  Third it has the possibility of attacking my knight on c3 with the move b4.
1119,36,9,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black prepares to castle as well.  I think that b4 is the better square for the bishop but the bishop on e7 is still a farily solid defensive structure.

Of course this knight manuever is more of a potential threat than an immediate threat since both his knight and his bisop currently guard c5.
1123,36,13,1f4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - f3',Now that black's king is committed to the kingside I can start my kingside attack.

The most immediate threat is that of Rf1-f3-h3 attacking h7.  I now no longer have the possibility of exf6 ep but I had a different plan for dealing with the pawn on f5.
1126,36,16,1Bb4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp1Q/1b1P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Threatening to double my pawns on the c-file.

A knight on g5 would attack the currently undefended pawn on e6 (though he only needs to move his knight on d7 to defend it with the light-square bishop).

Of course I can't ignore the queenside but I looked and didn't see any tactical shots he had on the queenside.

In the abstract it also lines up his bishop with my knight (which is currently undefended) as well as my king so I have to be wary of potential tactics.

If he allows 20) gxf5 exf5 I will have a protected passed pawn on e5 and I will still have the g-file open.  However 19) ... fxg4 has its own downsides as shown in the annotation for the next move.

1154,36,44,2Bh6,b'r1b3r1/4bkp1/p5RB/2ppP3/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/6RK b - -',! Because of black's last move his pawn on g7 is now pinned to his rook on g8 so he can't take my bishop.  I will win the g7 pawn and have a passed pawn on the h-file.
1155,36,45,2Bf5,b'r5r1/4bkp1/p5RB/2ppPb2/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/6RK w - -',Since black can't do anything about the pawn he instead chooses to move his light-square bishop into my position with and eventual Be4 pinning my undefended knight.

Although I hadn't yet lost my other game in the tournament I made the dangerous psychological decision of telling myself that I had already won this game.  Although black is down material and position in an endgame he still has chances for counterplay.  Winning a won game is possibly the hardest thing to do in chess.  When your opponent is down and on the verge of destruction he/she will be looking for his/her chances the most.  If you make one slip the game might just slip away from you and recovering from such a psychological blow can be very difficult."
1157,36,47,3Rxg7+,b'r7/4bkR1/p6B/2ppPb2/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/7K b - -',Being up two pawns all I need to do is trade off material (preferably the rooks) and I should have this game under wraps.  However to do so I need to play the correct moves.  You don't win a chess game by making bad moves after all.  You always need to play the best move even in a winning position.
1158,36,48,3Ke6,b'r7/4b1R1/p3k2B/2ppPb2/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/7K w - -',Moving the king toward the center as opposed to letting it become trapped on the edge.  In the engame the king is a valuable fighting piece and should be treated as such.  This theme of an active king being used as an attacking piece will eventually become the deciding factor of this game.

1160,36,50,3Bf8,b'r4b2/6R1/p3k3/2ppPbB1/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/7K w - -',Of course my opponent can't take on g5.  If he plays 31) Bxg5 then I end the game immediately with 32) Nxg5#.  My rook now looks like it's running out of room but I use my rook's active position to my advantage.
1161,36,51,3Rc7,b'r4b2/2R5/p3k3/2ppPbB1/1p1P4/2P2N2/PP5P/7K b - -',I now threaten two things.  One is to simply win the pawn on c5.  My other threat is to move my bishop which then threatens Ng5# (note how my pawns and rook trap his king on e6).
1162,36,52,3Be4,b'r4b2/2R5/p3k3/2ppP1B1/1p1Pb3/2P2N2/PP5P/7K w - -',Removing both threats by pinning my knight while simultaneously threatening to capture it for free.

1164,36,54,3bxc3,b'r4b2/2R5/p3k3/2ppP1B1/3Pb3/2p2N2/PP4KP/8 w - -',Black finally relieves the tension on the queenside but with a purpose.  After 34) bxc3 cxd4 35) cxd4 the threat of me winning the pawn on c5 no longer exists.
1165,36,55,3cxd4,b'r4b2/2R5/p3k3/3pP1B1/3Pb3/5N2/P5KP/8 b - -',"And the position has now simplified itself a bit.  I was starting to feel a bit uneasy about winning the game because of the positioning of my two passed pawns.  Passed pawns that aren't too far advanced and have two files in between them are able to be picked off by a lone enemy king.

I won't go into too much detail but king-and-pawn endgame theory shows that two connected passed pawns are self-supported since if the king takes the back one it will be unable to catch the other.  Likewise passed pawns with one file between them are also self-supported due to a ""wall"" that they create.  Ironically passed pawns with two files in between are no longer self-supported and can be picked off safely by the enemy king if the pawns are not advanced too far.

Although this was a bit far-fetched of an analysis of the position that thought started to weigh down on my mind."
1166,36,56,3Bb4,b'r7/2R5/p3k3/3pP1B1/1b1Pb3/5N2/P5KP/8 w - -',Potentially threatening Bc3 if I ever leave that square unguarded.  More importantly though it allows his rook to come into the game and threatens 36) ... Rf8 attacking the pinned piece.

1169,36,59,Rf8+,b'5r2/2R5/p3k3/3pP1B1/1b1P4/5K2/P6P/8 w - -',Now if I make a move like 38) Kg4 he will have the possibility of 38) ... Rf2 winning either the a-pawn or the h-pawn.
1170,36,60,3Ke2,b'5r2/2R5/p3k3/3pP1B1/1b1P4/8/P3K2P/8 b - -',This move guards f2 while staying on light squares to avoid check by black's bishop.  Ke3 was probably a bit more accurate though and black utilizes my poor decision a bit later on.  The mistake: putting my king on the same rank as my pawns.

It was around this point in the game where I blundered in my other game.

Of course I had calculated out other lines for black and with each line I tried to convince myself that there was something there such that I could win by force.  The line that my opponent played was one that I had calculated out but incorrectly evaluated at the end.

This is also why I should have played 40) Kd3.  Leaving my king on e2 was a mistake and part of the reason I missed it being a mistake was because I was focusing on my attack and not thinking clearly about his possible counter-attacks.

If my king were on d3 he probably would have moved his rook to f8 instead of c8 in order to threaten the move Rf2.  If his rook was on f8 instead of c8 his 42nd move would have needed to be different than what it was.  This would allow my to move my rook behind my passed e-pawn.

Back to the game this was all still part of my calculation made on move 40.  I figured he would move his king to c7 c6 or d6.  Afterwards I would play 43) e7[ ] and he would play 43) ... Kd7.  That is what ended up happening in the game."

Here again comes the theme of psychology.  I was convinced that he would play 44) ... Re8.  I never even considered what he actually played.  The move I should have played was 44) Kd3.  I needed to let my e-pawn go since I would still be up a pawn in a rook-and-pawn endgame."

However I'm now in a bit of psychological trouble.  I was two pawns ahead in an endgame.  Now I'm only one pawn ahead and he has a passed pawn.  I was looking for any opportunity I had to try to force a win.  The most direct route I saw was by bringing my king to e5 to attack his pawn on d5.  His bishop can't defend it his rook has a hard time defending it and his king can't defend it because it needs to defend the queening square of my pawn on e7.

My plan was to play 46) Kf4 and 47) Ke5.  I saw his saving move 46) ... Re2 but I found myself not caring due to my mindset of needing to win.  I was trying to lock onto anything I could."

At this point in the game I tried calculating out what the endgame would be like after 47) h5 Bxe7 48) Bxe7 Rxe7 49) Rxe7 Kxe7.  I can't remember my exact calculations but I think I ended up seeing both of us queening with me queening first for one line.  Actually my mind kept on wandering through calculations and I don't know if I was thinking perfectly clearly.

I'll go through some calculations I've made since the game ended.  First off I can't run my h-pawn up the board alone because his king is close enough to catch it.  If I try 50) Kg5 to defend my pawn as it comes up the board then my opponent plays 50) ... Kf7 and he can pin my king against the edge blocking my h-pawn.  After that he can simply queen his a-pawn and I would lose.  The final idea was a rather long one: each of us going after the other's pawn and coming back to the pawns on the d-file.  Neither of us moves our pawn because it just wastes a tempo for our king.  The variation runs as follows: 50) Ke3 Kf6 51) Kd3 Kg5 52) Kc3 Kxh5 53) Kb3 Kg4 54) Ka4 Kf4 55) Kxa5 Ke4.  There's nothing I can do to stop 56) ... Kxd4 and an eventual win by black.

I ended up pretty tired after trying to calculate everything out and not seeing a win for me so I went with option number two:"
1184,36,74,4e8=Q+,b'4Q3/3k3R/8/p2p2B1/1b1P1K1P/8/4r3/8 b - -',Double-check forcing his king to take the queen on e8.  Again I had a calculation in mind that gave him chances to slip up but would ultimately end up a draw if my opponent played correctly.

When I was calculating out black's possible responses to my 48th move I found the move 48) ... Bc3 which would basically force a draw.  The continuation I saw was 49) Bf6 [defending the attacked pawn] Re4  [winning the pawn] 50) Kf5 Bxd4 51) Bxd4 Rxd4 52) Rxa5 Rxh4 53) Rxd5 Rh5  54) Ke6 [or Ke4] Rxd5 55) Kxd5 and draw by insufficient material.

1192,36,82,5Kc4,b'4k3/R7/8/p5B1/1bK4P/8/8/4r3 b - -',"My idea behind this move was to somehow win his pawn on a5 after getting my king to b5.  After the game I later discovered that I should have instead played 52) Bf6.  The plan behind putting the bishop on f6 would be to put the bisop on d5 and the king on e6.  The most likely continuation would be 52) ... Rh1 [getting behind my passed pawn] 53) Ke6 Re1  54) Be5 Be7 [the only move to stop checkmate] 55) Rxa5.  This would win a pawn for me and give me a better shot at winning the game.

I think that a lot of the reason why I didn't see 52) Bf6 was because I was looking for a direct way to win.  Piling up pieces on a5 is the direct way to win the pawn.  However black should still be able to pull off a draw in this position.  The only key difference between my position and black's position is that my king is active in the center while his is pinned against the edge of the board.  With this I have a small advantage and can try to use it to win the game.  Of course the advantage is so small that the game should still technically be a draw."

Now in the ending my own bishop stops him from checking my king!  At this point in the game black resigned because there's nothing he can do to stop 58) Rh8#.

There's a certain beauty surrounding my final combination.  A checkmating net formed by a king bishop and rook.  A net where there was a single checking move before the final checkmate.  This brings up yet another theme: the threat is often stronger than the execution in chess.  If you leave several threats hanging in the air your opponent will have to try to defend all those threats.  Once you grab on to one threat though your opponent no longer has to worry about many threats and can simply defend one.  One final psychological theme out of many found in this game.

Another note: the ""need to win"" was what caused my opponent to get back in the game and it was also his downfall.  My opponent acknowledged that he needed to keep his bishop and pawn connected and the game would probably be a draw.  However he went for the ""win"" by attacking my pawn not fully realizing the consequences.

I hope you enjoyed reading this annotation and I also hope you learned something from it.  I hope you not only learned from the final combination but also from the psychological themes that appeared in this game.  Psychology is a huge part of chess especially in over-the-board games."
