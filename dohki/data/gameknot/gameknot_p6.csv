Capture the knight with ..Bxd6 loses the Queen on a5 and we don't want to do that if your black. Moving the King loses the right to castle and wins a free piece either the bishop at c8  or the rook at h8 depending on where the King moves!. My  oh mine what has black got himself into so now you will understand his next move a little better.
