0,0,0,b3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2P5/1P3NP1/P2PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White seeks to control the center from both flanks while Black occupies it directly.
1,0,1,d3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3pn3/2P5/1PNP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',It's been a quiet opening so far. Both sides are settling into position; White has a somewhat stronger LSB but it doesn't look like Black will have too much trouble freeing his.
2,0,2,Nfg4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3pn3/2P3n1/1PNP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black decides to turn the pressure up.

4,0,4,1Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpq2/3pn3/2P3n1/1PNP1NP1/PBQ1PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Black applies more pressure to the Nf3 though he needs to be wary of a pin along a1-h8.
5,0,5,1Rab1,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpq2/3pn3/2P3n1/1PNP1NP1/PBQ1PPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',White ensures his Bishop will be defended when his Queen leaves the second rank.

8,0,8,1g4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpnq1/3p4/2P3P1/1PNP1P1P/P1Q2PB1/1RB2RK1 b - -',The BQ has no spaces to run; now I hope to slide a Knight around to f4 via e2 without Black noticing (Ne2 Bf4 Bxf4 Nxf4 and the Queen is lost).
9,0,9,1b6,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1ppbpnq1/3p4/2P3P1/1PNP1P1P/P1Q2PB1/1RB2RK1 w - -',Black prepares to let his LSB out.

12,0,12,Qd6,b'r1b2rk1/p1bn1pBp/1ppqp3/3p3N/2P3P1/1P1P1P1P/P1Q2PB1/1R3RK1 w - -',Threatening ...Qh2#.

14,0,14,2Bh6,b'r1b1r1k1/p1bn1p1p/1ppqp2B/3p3N/2P2PP1/1P1P3P/P1Q2PB1/1R3RK1 b - -',? This bishop belongs on the long diagonal not this tiny corner. I am trying to press my advantage with a mating attack but frankly I can't and I don't need to. This Bishop should retreat to b2 and then I need to pull back my Knight and focus on defending my kingside. This move doesn't lose on its own but it certainly is one big step along the road.
15,0,15,2Rfe1,b'r1b1r1k1/p1bn1p1p/1ppq3B/3pp2N/2P2PP1/1P1P3P/P1Q2PB1/1R2R1K1 b - -',?? I tried to defend f4 in a clever way (not that it actually needed defending) and bring my Rook into the attack that I think I have going since now if 23...exf4?? 24.Rxe8+! However I missed Black's obvious threat and now I will probably lose.
16,0,16,2Qb2,b'r1b1r1k1/p1bn1p1p/1pp4q/3pp2N/2P2PP1/1P1P3P/PQ3PB1/1R2R1K1 b - -',I'm badly behind and my pieces are disjointed. I'm looking to sneak a mate on g7 now while I try to consolidate.

18,0,18,2Re7,b'r5k1/p1bnRp1p/bpp5/3p2qN/2P2pP1/1P1P3P/PQ3PB1/6K1 b - -',? Inaccurate but I'm running out of options and I want to bait the BQ away from her defense of g7. 28.cxd5 was probably better (28...cxd5 29.Bxd5 and at least I have a pawn and a slight initiative).
19,0,19,2Be5,b'r5k1/p2nRp1p/bpp5/3pb1qN/2P2pP1/1P1P3P/PQ3PB1/6K1 w - -',! Black takes control of a1-h8 and my hopes are dashed.
20,0,20,3d4,b'r5k1/p2n1p1p/bpp5/3pq2N/2PP1pP1/1P5P/PQ3PB1/6K1 b - -',Not great but I certainly can't afford to trade Queens. The game is lost at this point so I won't make many further comments but we played it to the end and the mating attack is very elegant.
21,0,21,3Nh5,b'4r1k1/p4p1p/bp4n1/6QN/3P2P1/1Pp4P/P4qBK/8 b - -',I'm hoping for 38...Re2? and a draw by perpetual check with 39.Qd8+ Nf8 40.Qg5+ etc.
22,0,22,3Re6,b'6k1/p4p1p/bp2r1n1/6QN/3P2P1/1Pp4P/P4qBK/8 w - -',But Black as usual spots my tricks and shuts me down.
23,0,23,Bxg2,b'5nk1/p1Q2p1p/1p4r1/8/3P1NP1/1P5P/P1p2qbK/8 w - -',! It is over.

52,2,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
53,2,1,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Personally I don't think White can safely decline this gambit especially with such a passive move. That said I see this all the time. More widely accepted are 3.Nxe5 3.Bc4 and 3.exf5.
54,2,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Essentially a waiting move. Black develops and waits for White to commit to an attack... or not.
55,2,3,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White is playing passively so Black goes immediately on the offensive.
56,2,4,Qe2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Preparing to castle long. White should be looking for a way to develop his KB soon probably to g2 or maybe h3 at this point.
57,2,5,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBQPPP/2KR1B1R w kq -',Black is also looking to castle queenside to make use of his kingside spatial advantage.
58,2,6,Bc5,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/2b1pp2/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PPBQPPP/2KR1B1R w kq -',Black would have nothing to gain by trading off this Bishop on c3 right now.
59,2,7,1Nd5,b'r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2npbn2/2bNppB1/4P3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq -',This is an interesting idea but I still think White should be dealing with his woefully undeveloped kingside.
60,2,8,1Bxf6,b'r3k2r/ppp2qpp/2npbB2/2bNpp2/4P3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq -',? This gives up the bishop-pair opens the g-file for Black's Rook and gives Black doubled f-pawns that are more of a strength than a weakness. I don't see any justification for this move--g2-g3 followed by Bh3 is stronger I think.
61,2,9,1c4,b'r3k2r/ppp2q1p/2npbp2/2bNpp2/2P1P3/P2P1N2/1P2QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq c3',Black was technically threatening to win a pawn on d5 but I think retreating the Knight or even giving up the pawn to clear some space would have been better.
62,2,10,1Qc2,b'2kr3r/ppp2q1p/2npbp2/2bNpp2/2P1P3/P2P1N2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',? I don't know what this is intended to accomplish. Perhaps White is trying to play Be2 and make some action on the kingside? Even if so I think he would be better served by playing h3 and g4. His position is hopelessly disjointed right now.
63,2,11,1Nd4,b'2kr3r/ppp2q1p/3pbp2/2bNpp2/2PnP3/P2P1N2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',Trading off White's kingside protection and opening c6 for a pawn kick.
64,2,12,1Kb1,b'2kr3r/ppp2q1p/3pbp2/3Npp2/2PbP3/P2P4/1PQ2PPP/1K1R1B1R b - -',The center is in danger of being blasted wide open and getting the King off the c-file is good--but putting him on a diagonal with his Queen isn't much better and White should have other priorities right now!
65,2,13,1Ne3,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppbp2/4pp2/2PbP3/P2PN3/1PQ2PPP/1K1R1B1R b - -',This blocks the Bishop's attack on f2 but I was expecting Nc3 at the time--on e3 it will be easily-harassed. White wants to defend his kingside but on e3 he will be hard-pressed to defend his actual King!
66,2,14,1Be2,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppbp2/4p3/2Pbp3/P2PN3/1PQ1BPPP/1K1R3R b - -',? Of all the times to move the Bishop...
67,2,15,f5,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppb3/4pp2/2Pb4/P2QN3/1P2BPPP/1K1R3R w - -',White didn't deal with it early when he had the chance and now Black's pawn center is formidable.
68,2,16,1Rhf1,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppb3/4pp2/2Pb4/P2QN3/1P2BPPP/1K1R1R2 b - -',White is preoccupied with defending his kingside pawns and they are certainly weak--but Black for the moment is not aimed that way.
69,2,17,1f4,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppb3/4p3/2Pb1p2/P2QN3/1P2BPPP/1K1R1R2 w - -',After 20.Nc2 Bf5 21.Qd2 Rhg8 White's position is looking fragile indeed.
70,2,18,2Ng4,b'2kr3r/pp3q1p/2ppb3/4p3/2Pb1pN1/P2Q4/1P2BPPP/1K1R1R2 b - -',?? White overlooks the royal pin and will lose in short order.
71,2,19,Ra5,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p5/r3pq2/2Bb1pN1/P7/KP3PPP/3R1R2 w - -',? Here I overlooked the direct route with 24...Qc2 and mate to follow.
72,2,20,2Nxe5,b'7r/ppk4p/2p1B3/r3N3/3b1p2/P4P2/KPq3PP/3R1R2 b - -',?? Not that it matters but White could have dragged it on a bit longer with 27.Rb1 or 27.Rxd4.
73,2,21,2Qxb2#,b'7r/ppk4p/2p1B3/r3N3/3b1p2/P4P2/Kq4PP/3R1R2 w - -',"Many thanks to bertinator for the game! Declining the Latvian Gambit can have brutal consequences without some very active play--White's forces were scattered and ineffective throughout the game.

74,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"One the always dangerous past pawn - which I had two of in this game
The power a pawn sac can give your other pieces by opening lines for bishops - in this game my opponent did not take the pawn and allowed my to get the past pawns but I still got to open the lines!!  Thanks to my friend WINECAPE who showed me this in one of his other games I will be using that trick more often!!! 

This was a rematch I was one pawn up in the 1st game when I grabbed another pawn and my opponent split my queen and King with a bishop and accordingly I resigned the game. Greed - still one of the 7 deadly sins!!

I wanted to show the power a pawns in this game in two ways.

174,6,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Jkarp moves a knight to the centre which is good but it is the wrong knight. When black plays 1. ...c6 he is telling you that he intends to play 2. ...d5 establishing a strong point in the centre and attacking e4. However the main drawback of 1. ...c6 is that it does not attack e4 immedaitely therefore white does have time to gain more space in the centre. This is why most white players play 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 only now once e4 is truely threatened does White defends e4 and develops the knight. If black plays 3. ...dxe4 then white is allowed to post a knight in the centre. 
175,6,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',White has played the wrong knight so now 2. ...d5 makes it a little problematic for white to defend e4.

Dont case pieces with pieces use pawns that are supported by another pawn. I also want to point out that with the absence of the LSB bishops the weakening of the light squares on the kingdside are not that serious.

250,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',She also likes to open with the King's Pawn Opening and I understand that because this is also my favorite.  In addition this is the most common opening.
251,9,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As usual I enjoy opening with the Sicilian Defense.
252,9,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"I do not know why she played this.  Afterall this is not the ""cornerstone"" of the Open Siclian Closed Siclian or Morra Gambit.  In my opinion she is probably trying to develop her LSB immediately."
253,9,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Normally I would play d6 immediately and that is the traditional method of continuing the Sicilian.  However 2.f4 was played so I am worried that she will try to cause damage with her LSB on the 5th rank (respond with 3.Bb5+) if I play 2...d6.  That is why I played this move.  Note: I am thinking of a bunch of transpositions and this is one of them in my opinion.  How will things transpose?  That will be answered a little later.
254,9,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Unless she is trying to develop I do not know why she moved there.  As I had mentioned earlier this is no longer a Closed or Open Sicilian.
255,9,5,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/2p5/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In the meantime I decide to continue with my defense.  BTW this why the position has transposed with the opening.  Note: For the Siclian 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 followed by 3...a6 (if not 3.d4)  or 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 is played.  Therefore this is not my normal routine.  If this is not a transposition it is an anomoly.  Anomoly=different out of the ordinary.
256,9,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',! She decides to develop her other knight and I understand that because development is essential.  In addition I know this position very well.   In the past I have developed with both of my knights in the beginning. 
257,9,7,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/q1p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',In this position I do not think or care about General Opening Principles.  Afterall I do not see how she can chase my queen away immediately.  She can only do this with 5.b4 but then 5...cxb4?! or 5...Qxb4!!.  However 5...Qxb4 is best because it still wins a pawn but without wasting time.  Other then that my queen is safe for now.  At this point I am planning a strategy that will eventually win material but this strategy is a little premature in my opinion.  In addition this plan will eventually cause me to loose.  This will be explained later on.
258,9,8,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/q1p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',! At this points she develops her LSB in order to castle.  I originally thought that her LSB was not well placed but 5.Bb5+? is not feasible due to my a6 pawn.  As I had mentioned earlier that is why I played 2.a6. 
259,9,9,Nh6,b'rnb1kb1r/1p2pppp/p2p3n/q1p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I was also thinking of 5...b5??.  Originally I did not think that this move was as good but 5...b5 would end the game.  How would this happen?  Stay tuned.

How is her king exposed?  One of her pawns is open near the king.  BTW I am referring to her f pawn.  Having said that there are supposed to be three pawns that keep the king protected and closed in.  If one of them are open the king is open so it is exposed.
261,9,11,Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/1p2pppp/p2p3n/q1p5/2B1PPb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?! At this point I decide to pin her knight because it is extremely dangerous in this position.  How is it dangerous?  I originally thought that she would win my f7 pawn and h8 rook.  However I did not realize that my rook was protected by the knight on the rim until now.  Most importantly she can and will break the pin easily with her Queen.
262,9,12,Qb4,b'rn2kb1r/1p2pppp/p2p3n/2p5/1qB1PPb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq -',?! At this point I decide to attack her LSB.  Note: I am not trying to gain tempo but I want win a free piece.  Although this move is not bad it is a waste of time because she will protect it with 8.d3.  My attitude and thought process on the other hand is a serious mistake that will eventually cause the loosing blunder.  It is a matter of time before this happens.
263,9,13,g6,b'rn2kb1r/1p2pp1p/p2p2pn/2p5/1qB1PPb1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq -',I decide to advance my g7 pawn so that I could develop my DSB.  However she has another trick up her sleeve.  What is her trick?  That will be answered shortly.
264,9,14,a3,b'rn2kb1r/1p2pp1p/p2p2pn/2p5/1qB1PPb1/P1NP1N2/1PP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',?! She decides to attack my queen but I can retreat and protect it.  Therefore I believe that this move wastes time if she is trying to win my queen.

266,9,16,1b5,b'rn2kb1r/4pp1p/p2p2pn/qpp5/2B1PPb1/P1NP1N2/1PPB2PP/R3QRK1 w kq b6',?? This is what I had planned since move 5.  In fact I talked about this move and was obsessed with it since my fifth move.  Why did I want to play this?  I thought that I would win a free bishop.  However this is my loosing blunder and it looses very quickly.  The game is lost because of what happens from here on in.  In other words what you will see from now until the end will prove that I do not have a chance. 
267,9,17,1Nxb5,b'rn2kb1r/4pp1p/p2p2pn/qNp5/2B1PPb1/P2P1N2/1PPB2PP/R3QRK1 b kq -',"Therefore she takes advantage by winning my pawn and attacking my queen.  Consequently I cannot exchange my pawn for her knight.  If 11...axb5 12.Bxa5 Rxa5 (loosing my queen for her rook).  As a result I must protect my queen and give up the pawn.  Having said that this is just the beginning so it will get much worse.  As I had mentioned earlier the game is lost for black.  However I do not want to give up yet because there is always hope until the end.  As they say ""It ain't over til it's over"".  In fact I want to stay in until I know that I'm going to loose."

As a result she is going to win a free rook after I get out of check.  Why can't I exchange her rook for my knight?  I will be placed in another check after she takes.
270,9,20,1Nb6+,b'1n3b1r/1q1kpp1p/pN1p2pn/B1p5/2B1PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',?! At this point I do not know why she placed me back in check.  I think that she is trying to trick me into taking her knight so that she could win my queen.  This is called Reversed Psychology.  With Reversed Psychology you are trying to trick your opponent by encouraging him or her to do something that you normally would not want.  Having said that I also view Deflective Sacrifices as a form of Reversed Psychology.  However I am not going to fall for her trick.

However she had other plans that I was unaware of.  She will also find another way to check me and I am also caught off guard.  On other hand it will not bother me.
274,9,24,Nc6,b'4kb2/1q2pprp/pNnp2pn/B1p5/Q1B1PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',That is because I get out of it with my Knight instead of the King or Queen.  This is how some of my other opponents stopped my plans after placing them in check.  They defended with other material instead of the King or Queen.
275,9,25,1Bd5,b'4kb2/1q2pprp/pNnp2pn/B1pB4/Q3PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',However this turns out to be another serious check not a nuisance because my knight is now pinned as a result.  
276,9,26,1Qa7,b'4kb2/q3pprp/pNnp2pn/B1pB4/Q3PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',? I did not want her to attack my queen so I decide to move it.  However this is a mistake because she will win another free piece by capturing my knight and placing me in check.

Afterall this is a discover check and discover checks usually catch me by surprise.  That is why I view them as the most dangerous types of check.  In addition this is also serious because she will win another free piece my DSB after I get out of it. 
278,9,28,Kb8,b'1k3N2/q3pprp/p1Bp2pn/B1p5/Q3PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',?? I moved my king because I thought that she was trying to find a mating pattern with her LSB DSB and f8 knight.  However this moved just made her plan realistic.  In other words her plan is going to work because of this played move.  
279,9,29,2Bd7,b'1k3N2/q2Bpprp/p2p2pn/B1p5/Q3PPb1/P2P1N2/1PP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Because she is going to mate me my hope is gone so I do not stand a chance.  Afterall I now know that I am going to loose and there is no way around it at this point.  Therefore I resign.  In chess you should wait for opportunities to arise instead of attacking or chasing pieces.  That is how you are going to win material and it is the right way to do it.  More often then not you are not going to win material by attacking them.  In some cases it will cause you to loose and that was illustrated in this game.   
280,10,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Here playing black on a challenge asked by Juanefe. Against d4 I play usually Nf6 giving me the oportunity to play the king indian defense the queen indian the nimzo or the benoni. I'm not a big fan of the queen gambit I find these games quite boring most of the time. The dutch mostly the leningrad variation look pretty interesting but I'm not experienced enought with this opening to think about playing it in a ranked game. Maybe in a close future.
281,10,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Well to tell the truth this move surprised me very much. I didn't seen this move quite often and seriously didn't know what to play against it. Black still have a lot of choice and could transpose it to something lookliking at the QID the KID or even the benoni. I think c4 is a little superior finally because it take the center right in the beginning giving a lot of space to your pieces.
282,10,2,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',I was thinking about to transpose into the benoni. With the knight on f3 white couldn't play the dangerous taimanov variation. This opening have his proper name the Spielmann-Indian Defense. The name come from of Rudolf Spielmann one of the best attacker in the first part of the last century.
283,10,3,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! Black have good results generally with the Spielmann-Indian. I think the best way to fight it as white is to advance the pawn to d5 going into the main lines of the benoni. By doing so white continue to keep his center pawn and take more space. The benoni is not considered as one of the best defense for black but I really like this opening because some of my favorite players (Tal Velimirovic) could do miracles with this. Anyway it's rare that I enter into the main line of the benoni cause it's rare beginners know them (and I'm not going to help them to! :D). I don't like that much that c3 move because the knight will not be able to use it if black don't take the d4 pawn.
284,10,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Well here black could have done b6 and going for a double flanchetto giving a fine position later. However this move sounded more natural to me.
285,10,5,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/P1P2N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I think it's a lost of tempo at this point of the game but it's still playable. White have now the option to do b4 to threat the c5 pawn.  I think Bg5 would have been better here.
286,10,6,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P4/P1P2N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The fianchetto on the queen side is often used in the nimzo and the queen indian. With this kind of position there's a lot of chance than white castle on the king side so the bishop positionned on b7 can create some nice attacks.
287,10,7,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P4/P1P1PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! At this point in the game I was thinking that this match would be at first a fight of space. I thought that it would be a hard fight in closed position a la Nimzowisht and I didn't wanted to be squizzed like a rat facing a snake. That's why I've been surprised by this move. White can now free his light squared bishop but it's gonna be harder for him to develop his queen side as we will see further in the game.
288,10,8,a5,b'rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/1p2pn2/p1p5/3P4/P1P1PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq a6',?! Well I'm not sure if it was that much a good move. I think it was a kind of high risk high reward move. Losing tempo but taking space and countering white's development on the queen side. It can pay as it can be a problem later because there's possibility that white find a way to take benefit of the weakness on b6 (only the queen can protect it right now)
289,10,9,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/3pbppp/1p2pn2/pBp5/3P4/P1P1PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',We're now both ready to castle on the king side.

With 5 pieces protecting the d7 pawn there's no way white can dream of taking it the only purpose of this move is to do Qf3 to threat my rook. On a bullet game or against a weak player it can be a strong move and give a won game early in the game but in this case it will only result as a lost of tempo. O-O would have been better here.
291,10,11,f3,b'rn1qk2r/1b1pbppp/1p2pn2/pBp1N3/3P4/P1P1PP2/1P4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',! Even if computer analysis doesn't like this move I think it's a good move useful later as much in offense than in defense.

It was too early in the game to make this kind of sac; white didn't have enought advantage to do this and it didn't provoked anything. White still lack of development not coordinated for a great attack and his pawn structure is not that fine.

So I decided to move the queen to e2 the bishop to e3 and exchange bishops. Then with some of the pressure off I could play d4.
332,11,13,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I think I should have played h3 sometime so I played it now instead of going along with my plan.

White will open up the centre sooner or later and Black will do well to keep his bishops because it is said that bishops work well when the centre is open. Better is 10...Be6.
334,11,15,b4,b'r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/2b1p3/1p2P3/2PP1Q1P/PPB2PP1/RNB2RK1 w kq -',!? Trying to get some queenside counterplay.

388,12,33,4Qxg5,b'8/3k1p2/2p1q3/6Q1/5P2/7P/P5PK/8 b - -',A big mistake since the a pawn has much more value than the g one.

390,12,35,c4,b'8/5p2/5Q2/1k5P/2p2P2/8/q5PK/8 w - -',A fatal mistake by black.
391,12,36,5Qxf7,b'8/5Q2/8/1k5P/2p2P2/8/q5PK/8 b - -',and black loses a tempo since he has to relocate his queen and can't deliver check in doing it.

394,12,39,5g3,b'8/8/8/8/1kp1QP2/6P1/5K2/3q4 b - -',Now this is very interesting: can white draw or even win?
395,12,40,5Kf3,b'8/8/4Q3/8/2p2P2/1k3KP1/3q4/8 b - -',White cannot allow a queen's exchange. Will white find tempoes to push his pawns?

402,13,0,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',By the way this is my nice reply to the unpleasant rossolimo variation. Most rossolimo players expect 3...g6 and not for the player to self pin the knight. Therefore not so many players encounter this line or study the theory much at all. My coach introduced me to this line after I was about to drop 2...Nc6 for 2...g6 for fear of 3.Bb5. 
403,13,1,c3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The main move here is to play 5.Re1 so after 5...a6 6.Bf1 with the bishop being quite flexible; it can fianchetto or stay active on the diagonal. 
404,13,2,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/4pppp/p1np4/1pp5/4P1b1/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now white cannot block the pin with his light squared bishop. However the game is still really even since the pin does not really matter much at the moment.
405,13,3,d3,b'r2qkbnr/4pppp/p1np4/1pp4b/4P3/2PP1N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White seems to be playing a ruy lopez sort of position and it seems decent enough. However the center is still quite fluid which means flank attacks are subject to failure by a counter in the center. 
406,13,4,1Nf1,b'r2qk2r/4bppp/p1nppn2/1pp4b/4P3/2PP1N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 b kq -',Really like a ruy lopez:).But it is a totally fine idea for white and there are no mistakes yet for either side. White has his kingisde potential prepared and black is still developing with a solid grip in the center. It is really about equal.
407,13,5,1Nf1h2,b'r2qk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1pp1n2b/4P3/2PP1N1P/PPB2PPN/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Seems quite odd but should be the best move. White had 2 other alternatives: 13.Nfd2 should certainly be bad because black has moved his pieces forward while white has been forced backwards; 13.g4!? Nfxg4 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Nfh2 Nxf3+(15...Bh5!? is quite interesting to me but 16.d4/Kg2 relieves white a bit 16.Nxf3 0-0 is quite unclear but black has quite the pressure and follows up with f5. A sample variation could be 17.Kg2 f5(17...e5 to prepare 18...f5 is interesting as well since if 18.Qd2 white's forces are quite tied up.) 18.e5 and now white has stalled the most dangerous black attacks and seems OK here(perhaps I will go for the 17...e5 line looks more promising). Anyways there was no need to do this calculation during the game. I just needed to see that the sacrifice was at least unclear for me to go ahead and play the move. If 13.g4 is played I can then think about it(probably not much due to the clock but I will examine it more deeply.). As a last judgement I am the one attacking in this line. The attacker's job is simply.. to attack and make threats while the defnder's task is very difficult.*note by the way I was looking through my analysis and realized that white can play 13.g4 Nxg4 14.Nxe5 winning the game. It just shows that we need to *calculate candidate moves on every turn*. 
408,13,6,1b3,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p5b/2nPP3/1P3N1P/P1B2PPN/R1BQR1K1 b - -',A good idea following the principle fo neutralization getting rid of my advanced knight. So far chances are roughly equal still since although white has the ideal centre black with the d6.e6 pawns still grips the center somewhat while the knights on the kingside are rather oddly(but not necessarily badly)placed.
409,13,7,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/pn1ppn2/1p5b/3PP3/1P1Q1N1P/P1B2PPN/R1B1R1K1 b - -',this move is the first inaccurate move in the game being played. The idea to use the battery against h7 is nice looking but unforunately this is one of the exceptions to where it fails terribly. There is the bishop on h5 which can move to g6 in an instant blocking the diagonal. Up to this point both sides have been playing rather fine.
410,13,8,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/4bppp/pn1ppn2/1p5b/3PP3/1P1Q1N1P/P1B2PPN/R1B1R1K1 w - -',This move is the only one which will give black the advantage. It is quite logical: Develops a piece and stops 18.e5 Bg6.

Black's threat after 17...Rc8 was very subtle since it is not a check or a capture but a quieter threat. The threat is quite easy to miss actually.

If the exchange is a bad one then you are in more trouble since you have increased the opponent's advantage.

I think I was going to checkmate white soon. The passed pawn was up for promotion and was going  to either take the queen or get promoted onn d1. depending on how white would have played. I think when you resign the game and your not losing you are only huirting yourself. Does anyone think they could take white from here and win?
729,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My opponent suggested me to play the Reti as it's quite an easy system to learn and the basic moves are virtually the same whatever Black plays against it. I have tried it in a few games but it didn't really fit my style (by the way both games transposed into other openings: one game into a rare kind of Queen's Indian and the other into a symmetrical English). After all I decided to stick with e4 (but I still try other moves sometimes) only on GK though.
730,25,1,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq b6',?! Obviously an incorrect pawn sac but who can prove that against a master? At least it got us out of the databases almost immediately.
731,25,2,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/8/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So here it is... The compensation consists of a bishop on the strong a8-h1 diagonal with pressure on the e4 pawn (and eventually the g2 pawn and h1 rook) and a misplaced bishop for White on b5 which needs to move again (it does little at this square). I do not really trust the computer in this kind of positions but the GK engine gives White an edge of almost +2 (winning for White). My own engine (Fritz) gives me +1.25 which is also a large advantage. I think it's less than that but the compensation is probably not enough. Still you can try it against a much weaker player.
732,25,3,g6,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/6p1/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',In hypermodern style Black wants to complete another fianchetto.
733,25,4,d4,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/6p1/1B6/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq d3',So I take the center as was my strategy in this part of the game. Of course I knew Black would try to destroy the center from the flanks but I had adopted this strategy from my first move on and so I thought I needed to stick with it.
734,25,5,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/5np1/1B6/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Putting more pressure on the center and almost forcing my reply. We can see now that Black has got the initiative by his first move.
735,25,6,Bd3,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/5np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I would like to be able to kick the knight but unfortunately 5.e5?? walks into 5...Bxg2 winning the rook on h1. Also I thought this bishop needed to move another time anyway so I decided to do it now rather than to defend with 5.Qe2 (the queen may be better placed on another square).
736,25,7,d6,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Probably planning ...Nbd7 and inhibiting an e5 advance (which would be possible after Nf3).
737,25,8,Nf3,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Developing normally but I like to play f4 against hypermodern systems and this stops that. I think I hesitated to make such a move because I knew how strong my opponent was and how such an opponent could create a kingside attack out of the blue. I know it's never a good strategy to play too defensively but it's simply something that happens almost unconsciously. Anyway this move isn't bad but simply less challenging than 6.f4. There were other options as well for example 6.Be3.
738,25,9,Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/pbp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I thought this was the best placement for the bishop since it helps defending the center but is nevertheless actively posted. However it does block a file for the rook (and possibly queen) and does not prevent a counterpunch in the center like ...e5.
739,25,10,Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This seemed like the best place for the queen because it prepares an eventual Bh6 exchanging Black's strong dark-squared bishop. this is also the best place to assist in a kingside attack and she is also nicely placed when the center opens up.
740,25,11,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This move looked a bit weird to me. I thought it was possibly to prepare a ...c5 push. Now I think I need to make something happen as my whole army except for the rook on a1 is developed.
741,25,12,1e5,b'2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/4P3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',!? I wanted to play either 10.e5 or 10.d5 and decided this was the best of those. The computer does not mark this as an inaccuracy but its evaluation drops half a point indicating it was not the best move in the position. I'm not quite sure what was better though. 10.d5 one of the suggestions of the computer doesn't look very good either it locks up the center completely opens up the a1-h8 diagonal and gives Black the opportunity to strike at Whites center with a move like ...c6. Besides that it creates a hole on e5 which can be exploited by a Black knight (not just yet but after the knight on f6 has moved). However it does discover an attack on the a7 pawn (I may have missed that). Another suggestion of my computer is 10.Bg5 indicating my bishop was not ideally placed on e3 but it's hard to play such a move after you have played Be3 2 moves ago.
742,25,13,Ng4,b'2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/6p1/4P3/6n1/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now my center comes under heavy pressure. I had not considered this move dangerous in my evaluations somehow but now it seems as if my e5 pawn is already lost (three attackers and one defender).
743,25,14,1Bf4,b'2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/6p1/4P3/5Bn1/2NB1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',? Now this is a real mistake. I had completely missed the nice 12.e6! which would be a very interesting pawn sac (not really actually since I would lose that pawn anyway) which both the GK computer and my own Fritzs give. After 12...fxe6 I could attack the weak Black kingside with moves like Ng5 and Bc4. After 12...Nxe3? the line 13.exd7 Nxf1 14.dxc8=Q Nxd2 15.Qxb7 wins a piece for a pawn for me. The computer suggests 12...Nde5 as the best move for Black. I played 12.Bf4 to preserve my bishop pair and because I thought I wouldn't save that pawn either but when a pawn is lost it's usually worth it to look for the best way to lose it.
744,25,15,1Bxf3,b'2rq1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/4P3/5Bn1/2NB1b2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Before taking on e5 Freddy first demolishes my kingside pawn structure.... Ouch this is even worse than a pawn structure with f4 (as mentioned at move 6) where you have a hole on the a7-g1 diagonal...
745,25,16,1Qe3,b'2rq1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/4n3/5B2/2NBQP2/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',I'm not sure about my reasoning behind this move but I needed to defend f3 and apparently I didn't want to retreat my bishop. However I still give up my bishop pair which I wanted to preserve 2 moves ago... My computer thinks 14.Be2 is the best move and I tend to agree.
746,25,17,1b3,b'1r1q1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/4n3/5B2/1PNBQP2/P1P2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',? A bad move which weakens the a1-h8 diagonal. I should have known that and play the more cautious 15.Rab1.
747,25,18,Rb4,b'3q1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/8/1r3B2/1PNQ1P2/P1P2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',!? A very agressive move by Black attacking my bishop and taking over some squares on my half of the board.
748,25,19,1Nd5,b'3q1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/3N4/1r3B2/1P1Q1P2/P1P2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',?? Now this is a tactical oversight by me. I wanted to defend my bishop in a clever way but had completely overlooked...
749,25,20,1Rd4,b'3q1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/3N4/3r1B2/1P1Q1P2/P1P2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',This simple double attack.

752,25,23,2Nxe7+,b'3q1rk1/p3Npbp/2p3p1/1Q2n3/3r1B2/1P3P2/P1P2P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',?? I don't know what I was thinking. Apparently I thought that this was the best way to lose my piece but now I'm losing two pieces instead of one. If I would have played 20.Nf6+ Bxf6 I could have followed up with 21.Qe2 and my bishop on f4 does not fall since the rook on d4 is pinned. Now I allow Black to unpin the rook and after this there are two pieces hanging the queen and the bishop.

There's a quite obvious check which drives the king away from its defence of the f3 pawn and which brings yet another attacker to my kingside with tempo. I told easy19 that I would normally resign in these circumstances but I played on because easy19 thinks you learn the most when you play out your games until mate. And indeed the mating attack is quite instructive. If everyone would consider it normal I would also play games out until the end but as some people think it's disrespectful to let them prove they can mate you I normally resign before they can mate me.

The advantage of this system is that white will always have a lot of space and has potential on the kingside with the e4 pawn. In most variations white is planning on the kingside area. In english opening variations without e4 white is seen playing Rb1b4b5 and attacking the queenside. 
832,29,1,b5,b'rnbq1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/1p6/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - b6',Black is executing his plan of attacking the queenside right away after making the obligatory Nf6Bg70-0. Although the center is techincally still dynamice in nature it is difficult to open it up since both sides have adequete control over it. Therefore a flank attack is totally acceptable.

The move 13.f4 certainly frees the g7 bishop but the benefits given to white should not be overlooked. White's pieces including the f rook and the e2 knight are both gaining in activity.
835,29,4,1exf4,b'r1bq1rk1/5pbp/p1np1np1/2p5/1pP1Pp2/3PB1PP/PP1NN1B1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Certainly now a move like 14.Nxf4 would lead to a balanced position without real tactical complications. However the next move drags both players into a deep complex tactical battle.

Now black has 3 main candidate moves. 14...dxe5 15.Bxc5 is easy. 14...Nxe5 15.gxf4 with a double attack on the rook and the knight. 14...fxe3 gives white a choice. A)15.Bxc6 and now black has a choice. A1)15...exd2 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Bxa8 Bxh3(or 17...Bxb2 first) 18.Bg2 white has some advantage. A2)14...dxe5 15.Bxa8 exd2 gives black the advantage. He is getting many pawns for the exchange as well as active pieces. By the way there were more variations that needed to be calculated. I am just listing a few. Therefore white needs to play B)15.exf6 Bxf6 16.Bxc6 Bxh3! 17.Bxa8 Qxa8 18.Ne4 Bxb2 with a advantage to black but nothing winning. Just listing these few variations makes my head start really hurting:). And these were just the main lines that we needed to calculate! To calculate the variations properly you really needed to slow down during each half move and ascertain ALL the new candidate moves for each side keep track of the material properly and avoid fainting at the same time and much more! Certainly black could have gotten an advantage with taking 14...fxe3. However the resulting position is still complex. Maybe black missed the variation. That would be possible considering the difficulty of the calculation here. Absolutely crazy position! However this is just the beginning! Black now chooses to take up the complexity up another level(!) and plays a dubious extremely complicated move. 
837,29,6,1Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/5pbp/p1np2p1/2p1P2n/1pP2p2/3PB1PP/PP1NN1B1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The fourth candidate move! Now the position requires immense precision. In fact I will not attempt to calculate many lines. I will just find the candidate moves for each side for each ply. Ready? Now white can play 15.gxf4Bxc6 g4. After 15.gxf4 black has Bb7 only as it is clearly the best move. But then there are not many tactics. As a last judgement the h5 knight is misplaced. 16.Ne4 looks accurate. OK but after 15.Bxc6 black can play 15...Bxh3fxe3. After 15...Bxh3 white can play 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 with complex position. Also white can play 16.Nxf4 with also complex position. So many different moves at each ply. Actually IM Lilov told me he spent almost half an hour calculating the variations in this position. Unfortunately the position is very complex and he made an oversight. 
838,29,7,1g4,b'r1bq1rk1/5pbp/p1Bp2p1/2p1P2n/1pP3P1/3Pp2P/PP1NN3/R2Q1RK1 b - -',(?!)A very nice interesting idea which gets white the advantage if black does not find the right reply. Actually there are 2 replies of equal strength; black just needs to find the right idea. It is clear right now that both the rook and the knight are hanging but the knight is trapped. So by logic shouldn't we save the rook?
839,29,8,1Ra7,b'2bq1rk1/r4pbp/p1Bp2p1/2p1P2n/1pP3P1/3Pp2P/PP1NN3/R2Q1RK1 w - -',(!)16...Rb8 leads to the same result. When you look at this move here it seems so very simple to find this move for black. However to tell the truth it is very very difficult. There was no way for white to know that this was the key line when there were many other side variations that needed to be calculated. Some of them had multiple branching points at every half move leading to dozens of variations. It is calculation at the highest level! By the way most calculations an master makes in his games will never look anything close to this. There are usually few branching points in the simpler variations so we can calcualte them easily. Now the critical moment has passed and black has a winning advantage. However Nevednichy the GM is confused and blunders the advantage right back!
840,29,9,Bxh3,b'3q1rk1/r4pbp/p1B3p1/2p1p2P/1pP5/3PpN1b/PP2N3/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The smoke has more or less cleared and black has a crushing attack and 3 pawns for the piece. Now 19.Re1 Qc8 wins for black.

842,29,11,2Bd5,b'3q1rk1/2r2pbp/p5p1/2pBp2P/1pP5/3PpNN1/PP6/R4QK1 b - -',And in just these few moves the position is more or less balanced! It is still probably somewhat favorable to black but both sides have chances. Although black has the rooks they are not effective since all their open files are totally blocked off! 
843,29,12,2Qh3,b'3q1rk1/3r1pb1/p5p1/2pBp3/1pP5/3PpNNQ/PP6/R5K1 b - -',Now white is back in the game and has a clear plan. He has more force on the kingside so it is time to start an offensive there.
844,29,13,2Rxd5,b'3q1rk1/5pb1/p5p1/2prp3/1pP5/3PpNNQ/PP6/R5K1 w - -',Probably the best move showing that the d5 bishop is worth more than the rook. 
845,29,14,Qf6,b'7r/5kb1/p2P1qp1/2p1pp2/1p6/3P1N2/PP2N1Q1/5RK1 w - -',Must have been in some time trouble or his head may have been hurting here:). Also he must have been upset that he had lost his advantage before. Probably all of those factors led him to forego a safety check of this move. Now white can win instantly.
846,29,15,2Ng5+,b'7r/5kb1/p2P1qp1/2p1ppN1/1p6/3P4/PP2N1Q1/5RK1 b - -',Now black has to give up the queen to avoid mate so white has won. An amazing game. Neither player can be blamed much; Very few chess players would be able to even find the right candidate moves in the variations.

853,30,6,5Kb5,b'8/8/3k1p2/1K1Bp1p1/3bP1P1/5P2/8/8 b - -',The position is dead: Black cannot penetrate on the K-side (nor can White) and White's King allows no penetration on the Q-side. All both sides can do at this point is trade Bishop moves back and forth which is pretty much what happened for the next 40 moves. During that time I made at least 10 more draw offers each one refused while miamere jeered at me for not being able to win. I include those moves now only to put them into the the official record. There will be only one further remark by yours truly.

933,35,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',At this point nothing really interesting has happened. However Black makes a chain of mistakes from here on out.
934,35,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This type of move is usually not advisable this early in the game. It blocks the king-side knight from using its main developing square and it exposes the king along the h5-e8 diagonal. It also seriously hampers the king-side bishop's ability to develop.
935,35,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here the computer suggested I do 4. Nc3 but this move did just fine. My thinking was that I wanted to make it more difficult for black to castle later on. Getting more control of the center was nice too. In fact little did I know but thanks to a couple major mistakes on Black's part my bishop became an integral part of a quick decisive attack.
936,35,3,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here's Black's next mistake. There are at least two reasons why this isn't a good move. First it does nothing to address the problem that he has at e5. At first glance it looks like there's no problem there. I have two attackers and he has two defenders but as it turns out his d-pawn has a little too much on its plate. The second reason why this isn't good is because it doesn't help black free up any space. Nc6 as suggested by the computer would've been better because it would've been quite helpful in defending the e5 square. 
937,35,4,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4P3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',At this point Black has a critical decision to make. Even I was not aware of how dearly Black could be crippled at this juncture had Black made a mistake here. As it turns out it is not a good idea for Black to capture my e5 pawn at all. Capturing with the f-pawn leaves black rather vulnerable on the king-side. Plus I can safely capture his pawn with my knight because as I said the d-pawn is a little tied up at the moment. Unfortunately for Black he doesn't realize this.
938,35,5,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This was by far Black's biggest mistake. Do you see why? By leaving the d-file Black's new e-pawn has paved the way for me to deal a major blow. The computer suggests Bg4 instead.
939,35,6,Bf7+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1nBpp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The fatal blow. Black has no choice but to capture my bishop.
940,35,7,Qxd8,b'rnbQ1b1r/ppp1nkpp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Having lost his queen Black chose to resign. I didn't realize that I would be able to launch such a powerful attack that quickly until Black's final fatal blunder.
941,36,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Really not much to be said here. I think most would prefer this dynamic move ahead of the duller 5.d4 which is more common and results more of a slower game due to the static centre.
942,36,1,Nc6,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2npb3/8/8/2P1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',My opponent has come up with a creative idea that is at least not mentioned in the theory books of this line. He intends to castle on the long side and therefore avoids my attack against the kingside.
943,36,2,1Kb1,b'2kr3r/1ppqbppp/p1npb3/8/8/2P1BN2/PPPQBPPP/1K1R3R b - -',"Simply consolidating the castling position. By the way here is a nice little tip about castling: ""Castling Queenside on average is slightly better than castling on the kingside. The reason is that activity is the idea of a chess game. By castling long the rook is activated immediately since usually the d pawn is advanced. Most cases the f pawn is not advanced and it takes extra turn to move the rook to a central file. Many can say that Kb1 takes a tempo too. However it is not always obligatory while moving the rook to central file is almost always obligatory."
944,36,3,Qa4,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2pbb2/8/q2B4/2P5/PPPQBPPP/1K1R3R w - -',This move is probably a mistake because it allows me to create weaknesses by taking the f6 bishop.
945,36,4,1Bf3,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2pbb2/q7/3B4/1PP2B2/P1PQ1PPP/1K1R3R b - -',Instead of taking immediately I simply activate by bishop to better diagonal. The position is equal and I am satisfied with a draw vs the opponent. I also want to keep it simple since he has 430 and I am 4.
946,36,5,1Rhe1,b'2krr3/1pp2p1p/p2pbp2/q7/8/1PP2B2/P1PQ1PPP/1K1RR3 b - -',White can now focus his attention to the weak target on f6. The white army is very active but the position is rather quiet.
947,36,6,Re5,b'2kr4/1pp2p1p/p2p1p2/q3rb2/8/1PP2B2/PKPQ1PPP/3RR3 w - -',This move turns out to be quite a bad one despite that it looks good. It has a tactical flaw. Now I can take advantage of it and win material. 20.Rxe5 and now the d pawn is pinned while the taking with the queen lets 21.Re1 getting the file.
948,36,7,2Qg5,b'2kr4/1pp2p1p/p2p4/q3pbQ1/8/1PP2B2/PKP2PPP/3R4 b - -',black intended to continue his idea but spent way too little time here. If he had looked at this position a bit longer he would have noticed he is losing decisive material.
949,36,8,2Bg6,b'2kr4/1pp2p1p/p2p2b1/q3p1Q1/8/1PP2B2/PKP2PPP/3R4 w - -',This move lets me a second option. If a move like 21...Bd7 22.Bxb7+ wins decisively. Now I choose to take the pawns as advantage since I feel I can march my own pawns up the board.
950,36,9,2Qxh7,b'1k1r4/1pp4Q/p2p4/q3p3/8/1PP5/PKP2PPP/3R4 b - -',And indeed white is winning the game. Unfortunately the calculations and the checking took too much time(and I had to pick up the phone as well) and now have 59 seconds upon the clock. If there was even a small increment I would be winning easily. Now it is not so certain.
951,36,10,2g5,b'1k1r4/1pp4Q/p2p4/4p1P1/8/1PP2q2/PKPR1P1P/8 b - -',My first mistake in time pressure. Now 28...Qf4 wins a pawn. However my opponent is also playing very fast and trying to imbalance the game.
952,36,11,3h4,b'3r4/kpp4Q/p2p2P1/4p3/7P/1PP5/PKPR1Pq1/8 b - h3',I am going to need a second pawn to help my g pawn.
953,36,12,e3,b'3r4/kpp4Q/p2p2P1/7P/8/1PP1p3/PKPR1Pq1/8 w - -',Just kept pushing the h pawn up completely missing the opponent's idea. However I have a forced win here.
954,36,13,3Qh8,b'3r3Q/kpp3P1/3p3P/p7/8/1PP1P3/PKP3q1/8 b - -',This is the clincher now h7 is coming up with 2 white queens. I knew I was lost here due to my 4 seconds.
955,36,14,a3+,b'7Q/kpp3Q1/3p4/8/8/pPP1q3/PKP5/8 w - -',I lost on time. It was a good game though. And there was only one real mistake one my part in  the blitz game on move 28. But although I lost I was still very happy about the game as a whole. Really the only thing you should focus on is the quality of the chess game you played not the result. If you lose but played very well that means you are imporving. If you play badly and win sooner or later you will not get so lucky. In this game the players were stronger than the average opponent. There was really only one mistake made by both sides. Black's only real mistake was letting go of the material(the doubled pawns can be overlooked since they were difficult to attack and in blitz opening lines for your pieces and ignoring structure more or less is a good idea.) and my mistake I mentioned already. His mistake was a bigger one and I won the position but lost the game.

Rather unlike the Sozin which is an opportunistic positional treatment creating steady pressure against Black's center the Richter-Rouzer aims to conjure up a tactics-based attack on Black's K-side.

This continuation has been around for a long time but I seldom see it played at GM levels anymore and only very rarely at the level of chess most of us mortals play on. Must be a ""fashion"" thing.

I reached the important milestone of Near-Expertdom with this game - just 97 points south of it!  I did get a bit of a leg up from timeouts/early resignations from Masters Freddy and Chrisobee but after being anchored in the high 1700s for months on end I decided to enter into Concordborn's MT to try and pick up rating points against 1500-1700 players.  Thankfully I managed to get the wins which boosted me up to where I am now - 1903.  This is the game which finally got me to those dizzy heights.  Here is the analysis.

1000,39,7,2cxd5,b'r2q1r2/1b3pkp/8/p1pPp1b1/1p6/5B2/PPN4P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',22. cxd5 - after this stouche I remain two pawns ahead but my kingside pawn structure is busted and Henry is putting in an order for a pair of medieval stockings - 100 denier medium sized Glenda dear!
1001,39,8,2Qf3,b'r2q2r1/1b3pk1/7p/p1pPp1b1/1p2B3/5Q2/PPN4P/R4RK1 b - -',24. Qf3 - now comes the Wicked Witch of the West and she has her beady eye on my pawn on f7.  Fou Lenoir now blocks this file by moving to f4.
1002,39,9,Kh8+,b'r2q2rk/1b3p2/7p/p1pPp3/1p2Bb2/5Q2/PPN2R1P/R5K1 w - -',25. .... Kh8+ - discovered check.
1003,39,10,2Qxd3,b'r2q2rk/5p2/7p/p1pPp3/1p3b2/3Q4/PPN2R1P/R4K2 b - -',28. Qxd3 - bishop trade.  At least a possible discovery on my rook on a8 from white's lsb has been addressed.
1004,39,11,2Qd6,b'r5rk/5p2/3q3p/p1pPp3/1p3b2/3Q4/PPN2R1P/R4K2 w - -',28. ...... Qd6 - a new defensive role for Glenda - blockade.
1005,39,12,Rg6,b'r6k/5p2/3q2rp/p1pPp3/1p3b2/3Q4/PPN2R1P/3R1K2 w - -',29. ...... Rg6 - with a possible plan of doubling up on the g file and attacking the WK.
1006,39,13,Raxa6,b'7k/5p2/r4r1p/p1pPp3/1p3b2/5N2/PP3R1P/3R1K2 w - -',32. ...... Rxa6 - queen trade.  I wanted to avoid the march of the d5 pawn so both rooks double up on my third rank instead.
1007,39,14,c4,b'7k/5p2/r4r1p/p2Pp3/1pp2b2/5N2/PP2KR1P/3R4 w - -',33. ..... c4 - this pawn is very vulnerable at the moment.  It seems unthinkable that this pawn will spell checkmate for my opponent many moves down the line doesn't it?  This pawn move prevents Kd3 and keeps the WK anchored to its third rank - at least for the time being.
1008,39,15,Kf8,b'5k2/5p2/r4r1p/p2Pp3/1pp2b2/8/PPN1KR1P/3R4 w - -',"35. ...... Kf8 - Henry is worried about the d pawn advancing and wishes to free his men to do other work than simply blockade it.  Dare I assume ""Advantage Black"" here?"
1009,39,16,4Kxe3,b'8/4kp2/r6p/p2Pp3/1pp5/4K2P/PP3R2/8 b - -',40. Kxe3 - the WK moves to the third rank at last but not before a lot of wood has disappeared from the board.  With the remaining rooks off the board I think it is game set and match to jstevens1 - but the rooks are on the board and there is still work for me to do to bring about a victory here.
1010,39,17,Rxh5,b'8/4kp2/7p/p2Pp2r/1pp1K3/8/PP3R2/8 w - -',43. ..... Rxh5 - might as well.
1011,39,18,Kxd6,b'8/5p2/3k3p/p3p2r/1pp1K3/8/PP3R2/8 w - -',44. ..... Kxd6 - again - might as well even though I know that the f7 pawn is finally gonna drop.
1012,39,19,Rh4+,b'8/5R2/3k3p/p3p3/1pp1K2r/8/PP6/8 w - -',45. ..... Rh4+ - I wanna get my rook to h2 to get among white's remaining pawns but first I want to drive back the WK.  If the WK moves to f5 however I can always force a K & P ending with Rf4+.
1013,39,20,Rh2,b'8/5R2/3k3p/p3p3/1pp5/4K3/PP5r/8 w - -',46. ..... Rh2 - white can always avoid dropping a further pawn by playing Rf2 but it gives me the desired K & P ending.  White does not want this.
1014,39,21,c3,b'8/8/3k3p/R3p3/1p6/2p1K3/Pr6/8 w - -',48. ..... c3 - suddenly in the space of one move that weakie on c4 has become a formidable unit on c3 - just two squares from Glendadom.
1015,39,22,h5,b'8/8/3k4/1R2p2p/1p6/2p1K3/Pr6/8 w - -',49. .... h5 - here I decided to push my h pawn in order to distract the WK and WR away from my queenside pawns.
1016,39,23,Rxa2,b'8/8/7R/2k1p2p/1p6/2p1K3/r7/8 w - -',51. ..... Rxa2 - white's final pawn drops.  I now think that the WR and WK have far too much to do.
1017,39,24,c2,b'8/8/8/2k1p2R/1p6/4K3/r1p5/8 w - -',52. ..... c2 - one square just one square .....
1018,39,25,b3,b'8/8/8/2k1p2R/8/1p6/r1pK4/8 w - -',53. ..... b3 - my b pawn supports my c pawn.  My e pawn is gonna drop but Henry has a plan to take refuge on b2 and I also plan to plonk my rook on a1.  When that happens white cannot stop my pawn from reaching c1 and inflicting eventual Glendadoom on his king.
1019,39,26,Ra1,b'4R3/8/8/8/1k6/1p6/2pK4/r7 w - -',55. ..... Ra1 - I now set up conditional moves to get Henry to b2.  We play out the first of them and then white gives up the ghost and hands me that 1900 rating.  Well I still feel a little out of my depth against players in the 1900 - 2100 bracket even with this new rating.  At least if I play to the top of my game I can expect to hold my own against these players.  But consistency will be the key. At least I can never go below 1700 whatever happens.  So I will bask in this new found glory and then concentrate on my other games.  I hope you have a good read - bye for now - Joanne
