0,0,0,Bb6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/3B4/3PPp2/2P2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',White has a good position
1,0,1,Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/3B4/3PPB2/2PQ1b2/PP4PP/R4RK1 w - -',No particular need to exchange now
2,0,2,1Rxf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/3B4/3PPB2/2PQ1R2/PP4PP/R5K1 b - -',White decides to retake with the rook and pile up on the f file
3,0,3,h6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1npp1/1b1p3p/8/3PPB2/1BPQ1R2/PP4PP/R5K1 w - -',This move weakens Black's king.
4,0,4,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/1b1p2np/8/3PP3/1BPQBR2/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Now white threatens to take on f7
5,0,5,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pp1/1b1p2np/2p5/3PP3/1BPQBR2/PP4PP/5RK1 w - c6',There is not enough time for c5??
6,0,6,1e5,b'r5k1/pp3Rp1/1b1p2np/2p1P3/3P3q/2PQB3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Here e5! attacks the knight

8,0,8,2Rxg7+,b'r5k1/pp4R1/1b4Qp/2p1p3/3P2q1/2P1B3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Rxg7 ! White wins by taking the queen but this is faster
9,0,9,2Rh7#,b'r6k/pp5R/1b4Qp/2p1p3/3P2q1/2P1B3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',
10,1,0,Bg5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/6B1/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White has a few stronger moves than the Bg5.  White could have taken strong control over the center with Nxd4 or created some additional attacking options with Bc4.  This bishop move allows Black to move to the offensive.
11,1,1,h4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/6B1/3pP2P/5N2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq h3',Another questionable move by White.  White advances the h4 pawn which compromises the king side pawn structure if White intends to castle in that direction.  White might have been trying to prevent moving the knight from f3 (which is threatening to capture Black's d pawn).   however i this position White can simple move Bf4 which still gives him an active bishop although he did allow Black to develop his BSB.
12,1,2,f6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppb1pp/2n2p2/6B1/3pP2P/5N2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black's attack on the BSB is a bit premature at this point.  Although the f6 attack can lead to a very strong king side initiative (6. Bf4 g5 7. hxg5 fxg5 )  If White wishes to continue to trade in this scenario the black king can be left with no pieces to defend his flank.
13,1,3,Bb4+,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/8/1b1pPB1P/5N2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',The bishop check allows black to trade down an awkward pawn for White's c pawn however Black would have been better to continue development at this point.  Pushing the d pawn to allow for the development of his WSB and to help prepare to castle would have been better.
14,1,4,Ba5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/b7/4PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black is forced to either retreat his bishop to the initial square or to place it in this odd position.  
15,1,5,Bc4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/b7/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White not immediate threats against him White continues to develop.
16,1,6,1Qd5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/b2Q4/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN2K2R b KQkq -',White finds a great position for his queen and threatens mate.  
17,1,7,1Qe7,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2np1p2/b2Q4/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN2K2R w KQkq -',This is the only move to prevent a mate sequence by White.  
18,1,8,1O-O,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2np1p2/b2Q4/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN3RK1 b kq -',White should have reviewed Bb5 at this point.  This combination may very well allow White to go up a piece for a pawn.  (11.  ...  Bd7  12.  Bxc6  Bxc6  13. Qxa5)  or (11.  ...  Bxc3  12.  Nxc3).  The only other attempt to save the bishop (11.  ...  Bb6  12.  Bxc6  bxc6  13. Qxc6 ) leaves the a8 rook to black.   
19,1,9,a6,b'2kr2nr/1ppbq1pp/p1np1p2/b2Q4/2B1PB1P/N1P2N2/P4PP1/R1R3K1 w - -',Black needs to prevent the White's knight from reaching the b5 square.  
20,1,10,Bb6,b'2kr2nr/1ppbq1pp/pbnp1p2/3Q4/2B1PB1P/N1P2N2/P4PP1/1RR3K1 w - -',Black has multiple weaknesses in his defense.  It is imperative that he hold onto his pawns so that White will be forced to sac key pieces in order to reach the king.  Black is in a completely defensive state with little thought of attacking White.
21,1,11,Ne5,b'2kr2nr/1ppbq1pp/pb1p1p2/3Qn3/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P1N2PP1/1RR3K1 w - -',With White's last defensive move Black takes the opportunity to force White's bishop to move.  Here Black would be more than willing to exchange pieces just to reduce the size of the attack that he is facing.
22,1,12,1Rxb6,b'2kr2nr/1ppbq1pp/pR1p1p2/3Qn3/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P1N2PP1/2R3K1 b - -',It is unclear why White decides to exchange his rook for a bishop without a clear attack at this point.  I don't believe that the doubled b pawns is enough compensation for this exchange.
23,1,13,Bc6,b'2kr2nr/1p2q1pp/ppbp1p2/3Qn3/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P1N2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Black again takes the opportunity to chase away White's attacking pieces.  
24,1,14,1Qe6+,b'2kr2nr/1p2q1pp/ppbpQp2/4n3/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P1N2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',Up in material Black is more than happy to exchange the queens which also greatly reduces the threat on Black's position.
25,1,15,b5,b'3r2nr/1pk3pp/p1bpB3/1p2p3/4P2P/2P1B3/P1N2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Black has not solidified his position and can begin to mount an attack against the White pieces.  With the material advantage and White's two isolated pawns on a and c his goal is to get to an end game quickly and leverage the advantage of a more solid pawn structure and rook to bishop comparison.
26,1,16,2Nxc6,b'4r2r/1pk3pp/p1N2n2/1p1ppB2/4P2P/2P1BP2/P5P1/1R4K1 b - -',Again White trades down another piece which only helps Black's pawn structure and brings the game close to the ending.
27,1,17,Rxe4,b'5r2/2k5/p1p2P2/1p2ppP1/4r3/2P5/P5R1/6K1 w - -',This is a major blunder for Black and should cost him the game.  At this point there is no way to prevent White from promoting one of his g or f pawns.   Rg4 is a much better move and will allow Black to capture both pawns and trade down the rooks.  (34 Rxg4 fxg4).
28,1,18,Re1+,b'5r2/2k5/p1p2PP1/1p2pp2/8/2P5/P5R1/4r1K1 w - -',Black makes a desperation move just to see if White makes his own blunder.
29,1,19,3Kf2,b'5r2/2k5/p1p2PP1/1p2pp2/8/2P5/P4KR1/4r3 b - -',Kh2 would have allowed Black the chance to recapture the pawns by using Rh8  as a spring board to reposition his rooks.  However White makes the better move.
30,1,20,3Rxa2,b'8/2k3P1/p1p2r2/1p2pp2/8/2P2K2/R7/8 b - -',This is the blunder that Black was waiting for.  g8=Q is a much better move.  With the promotion granting White the queen a rook trade at g2 should be welcome.  White also would have established his queen behind Black's pawn structure and in good position to maneuver around the remaining Black rook.
31,1,21,Rxg7,b'8/2k3r1/R1p5/1p2pp2/8/2P2K2/8/8 w - -',Under time pressure and eager to remove the major threat of g8 Black captures the g7.  The third major blunder of the game.
32,1,22,4Ra7+,b'8/R1k3r1/2p5/1p2pp2/8/2P2K2/8/8 b - -',White now wins Black's last rook.
33,1,23,Kc5,b'8/6R1/2p5/1pk1pp2/8/2P2K2/8/8 w - -',Black now attempts to remove White's c pawn and push the b and c pawns in hopes of promotion.
34,1,24,4Re3+,b'8/8/2p5/8/1p6/2k1RK2/8/8 b - -',Repetative Check = Draw.
35,2,0,Nxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2N5/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',and I capture one of his knights immediately like i wanted

37,2,2,Nc3,b'r1bk3r/ppp3pp/2p2p1n/2b5/4P2B/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',now i think f3 was better
38,2,3,Ng4,b'r1bk3r/ppp3pp/2p2p2/2b5/4P1nB/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',that's why.

40,2,5,Ne5,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/2pb1p2/4n3/N3P2B/P2R1P2/1PP3PP/4K2R w K -',b5 was better for him...
41,2,6,2Rb3,b'r6r/p1p2kpp/2p2pn1/1p2b3/1P2P3/PR3P2/1NP2BPP/4K2R b K -',His attack is less incisive.
42,2,7,Rxe5,b'r5k1/p1p3pp/2p2pn1/1p2r3/1P2P3/PR3P2/2P2BPP/4K2R w K -',i take his bishop and...he comes out with his rook!
43,2,8,2Bg3,b'r5k1/p1p3pp/2p2pn1/1p2r3/1P2P3/PR3PB1/2P3PP/4K2R b K -',and now he lose a pawn (c7 or c6)

49,2,14,4Qe8,b'4Q3/6pk/3Bn2p/6r1/8/P5P1/2P3KP/3R4 b - -',And he resigned. let me know your impressions on this game!
50,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Another game that I think I played well other than a few mistakes but I have only been playing for 7 months at this time so mistakes are going to happen. Fell free to comment if you see something I did not. I will try to learn all the abbreviations for pieces and moves in the future but I will do my best for now. 
51,3,1,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p2b4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is how I was opening up most of the time for awhile. I grew not  so fond of it because if I move my Q pawn to d3 I end up leaving my bishop open for a pawn attack. 
52,3,2,d4,b'rnbqk1nr/1ppp1pp1/p2b3p/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',Try to a achieve what I think is the Sicilian defence with a pawn exchange. 
53,3,3,Nge7,b'r1b1k2r/1pppnpp1/p1nb1q1p/4p3/2BPP3/P1N1BN2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',We are both loaded up for a big exchange.

55,3,5,Na7,b'r1b1k2r/npppnpp1/p2b1q1p/3Pp3/2B1P3/P1N1BN2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Don't think that was the best move but then again I have only been playing for 8 or 9 months. His knight is useless for the time being. 
56,3,6,1Ng3,b'r1b1k2r/nppp1pp1/p2b1qnp/3Pp3/2B1P3/P3BNN1/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Preparing for a King side attack.

58,3,8,1a4,b'r3k2r/nppbqpp1/p2p2np/3Pp3/P1B1P3/4BN2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Defending his bishop from advancing to b5. Maybe not a very good move.  
59,3,9,1g4,b'r4rk1/nppb1pp1/p2p1qnp/3Pp3/P1B1P1P1/4BN1P/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQ g3',After he castles I start to push my pawn attack. I should be able to castle in the next few moves and bring my other rook into the game.
60,3,10,1Bxf4,b'r4rk1/nppb1pp1/p2p1q1p/3Pp3/P1B1PBP1/5N1P/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQ -',I did not like that knight coming down on me. I struggle sometimes with defending the knight attacks. Maybe I have not been playing long enough to fully understand the best ways to defend them. 
61,3,11,2Qf2,b'r4rk1/1ppb1pp1/p2p1q1p/3Pp3/P1B1PnPP/5P2/1PPN1Q2/1K1R3R b - -',I have made him a nice little home for his knight. I am not feeling very comfortable at this point. Even though his knight does not seem to pose a great threat right now.

65,3,15,gxh6,b'5rk1/r2bnp2/3p3p/1p5P/4PR1R/1B6/1PPN4/1K6 w - -',Now I have him opened up.

69,3,19,fxe6,b'5r2/4n1k1/r2ppR1p/1p2P2P/8/8/1PPN3R/1K6 w - -',Not what I thought he would do. Instead of giving me a bishop for free he gave me his rook in 2 moves.
70,3,20,4Rgf6,b'5R2/7k/r3pR1p/1p2pn1P/8/8/1PPN4/1K6 b - -',His next move was the ending. I guess he overlooked what was coming.

a) brings another piece into play
b) prevents Be7 for the time being
c) keeps the knight on the useful f3 square
d) tempts black to go queen chasing"
153,9,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq c6',Standard here is Nc6 followed by Bb5 with a slight advantage to white.  Dean decides to kick the queen out with his c-pawn instead.  Not an awful move but it doesn't help black with developing a piece.

By trading off his only good piece (which took two moves to do) and allowing white to replace his Nf3 with a Qf3 black gives white a 3-0 edge in developed pieces plus gives up his only advantage: the two bishops.

The queen -for the moment-- is safe from harrassment from Nc6 but interesting is 5...c5 attempting to transpose to play resembling the symmetrical variations because it gains black time.  At first glance the problem with 5...c5 seems to be that it loses time on an opening when very few pieces are already developed by black but the fact is that black can play the move with relative impunity because white is forced to move the queen.  (Grandmasters today use tranpositions as much as weapons as other techniques.)    Kosten doesn't mention the possibility but it looks like an enterprising way to attempt to get someone out of their theoretical knowledge-base.  I think it's interesting also because it's uncharted territory.  It's the bane of the chess player: interesting games are novel; novel games are filled with flaws and tactical surprises that may cause a loss."

Kosten states that 5...d5 6.cxd5 Nxd5 attempting to avoid the isolated pawn is eronious because black will suffer serious problems in the endgame.  Black should not play c6 unless he is willing to accept the IQP play.  The question has been raised ""Why play 5...d5 when the IQP appears to only be a weakness?""  The answer isn't simple.  Part of the answer is unless white errs it's unavoidable.  Second after Be6 reinforcing the pawn black's center can suddenly become strong if white captures on e6.  White will then have to play carefully.  Kosten's book emphasizes undermining the isolani as white but he provides about a full page of typed analysis on the issue.  Schiller's book on the Tarrasch makes clear that there are tactical advantages from accepting the IQP."
208,12,5,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/8/1bPQ4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',"White could play Nc3 but the bishop move is forcing.  Black faces several poor choices now.  He can move the same piece twice retreating or he can move the piece twice tempting white to do so as well.  Playing c5 forces the white queen to move but white can force black to cede the gained tempo.
If black captures and the queen retakes it might seem like it goes against the opening principle of getting pieces to their positions as quickly as possible but white was eventually going to have to move the queen once more anyway and black violates the principle first.  If 7...c5 then 8.Qe5  seems reasonable.  Both continuations allow white to deprive black of castling rights."

Second the b pawn is vulnerable.  Expected 11...Nxc3.  It's usually considered good form to reinforce pieces with pawns. As such if he's concerned about NxN then f5 might have more merit than Bf5. Frankly Nxe4 allows black to escape the pawn island even if it will require f5 to defend it.

Since DS bishops are gone the queen capturing on c3 faces no immediate meaningful challenge.  So 12...Nxc3 13.Qxc3 Qxd5 does seem to escape the IQP but white's connected rooks can seize her file.  It seems to me that white is better developed and has a better plan to deal with the challenges of the position.

After 14...Nxc3 15.Qxa8 15...Be4? 16. f3 proves to only favor white where only bishop or knight can be saved not both.  15...Nxe2  is impossible because of 16.Nxe2.  the only logican continuation is the knight retreat.  15...Nb5 looses to 16. Nxb5 so black is left with 15...Ne4 which while it seems defensible is not particularly strong.

324,16,0,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black could have made a more aggressive with a more common move of d5.  Although d6 is not bad.
325,16,1,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black should look at h6 as an option.  This move would force White to withdraw his bishop or better trade the bishop for the Black's knight.  Although this trade would create a weakened king side castle position (if Black decides to take that route) he does ensure that White will not maintains the bishop pair as the game develops.
326,16,2,Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p3B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',White is looking to begin attacking along the king side in anticipation that Black with castle that direction due to the advancement of the c pawn which creates a weakened pawn structure to defend the queen side castled position.

With this White gives up another pawn which gives Black a large advantage if he can avoid the current attack on his king.  It also puts the White King in a precarious defensive position with very little in defensive pieces.  Be2 would be a stronger move as it opens the king side castle opportunity and removes the threat of the discovered check if Black moves the e4 knight.

Nxh1 14.  Nf6  Kxg7 15. Nxe8 Qxe8 16. Bd3 Nf2 which creates another fork of White's remaining rook and the WSB. )

Although these lines are not conclusive strong play must be had to ensure that Black does not lose any major material or the advantages already created.  In addition to preventing these complications this knight move will work to derail the attack being established by White.
334,16,10,h5,b'r1bqr3/pp3pk1/3p2p1/2pNn1Np/2Pp3Q/8/PP3nPP/2KR1B1R w - h6',Black decides to trade the knights (with check) and being to press an attack against the weak defense of the king.

337,16,13,1Ng4,b'r3r3/pp3pk1/3p2p1/2pN1b1p/2Pp2n1/8/PP4PP/K2R1B1R w - -',Black begins to maneuver the knight to fork the rooks (again).  At this point he is more than willing to trade down all material and even allow his knights to get forked.  If White does try to fork the rooks he will end up losing his own rook and his knight with only one rook for compensation.
338,16,14,Nxd3,b'r3r3/pp3pk1/3p2p1/2pN3p/2Pp4/P2n4/1P4PP/K6R w - -',Black could have captured the h1 rook but that would have put his knight out of play for a few moves.  By capturing this rook he can also force the rook trade with Re1 .

481,21,6,1O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/4p3/3n1p2/1b1N4/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Breaking the pin on the c3 knight and forcing Black to decide whether to make the exchange there or not.
482,21,7,1bxc3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/4p3/5p2/1b1N4/2PBP3/P1Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I decide to isolate White's queenside pawns while I have the chance.
483,21,8,Qc7,b'rnb2rk1/ppq3pp/4p3/b4p2/3NP3/2PB4/P1Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Getting wood off the back row needs to be Black's priority at this point and this also attacks the c3 pawn.
484,21,9,1Bb2,b'rnb2rk1/ppq3pp/4p3/b4p2/3NP3/2PB4/PBQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Defending the pawn and getting the bishop on the long diagonal where it will eventually exert more influence
485,21,10,Nxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq3pp/4p3/b4P2/3n4/2PB4/PBQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',More or less forced to keep from falling behind a pawn but now the isolated c pawn will become a dangerous passed pawn
486,21,11,exf5,b'r1b2rk1/pp4pp/8/b4p2/3P4/8/PBB2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The first round is over with White clearly ahead having two well placed bishops and a passed albeit isolated pawn.  Also Black's weakened a2-g8 diagonal is now vulnerable
487,21,12,1Rfd1,b'r1b2rk1/pp4pp/8/b4p2/3P4/8/PBB2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Now time to manuever for position.  White sets up a pushing rook behind his passed pawn nearly always a good idea.
488,21,13,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/pp1b2pp/8/b4p2/3P4/8/PBB2PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',"Here I made the decision to try to get my bishops to optimum locations as I thought the diagonals would probably be what would win or lose the game from this point.
Ideally I would like to blockade the passed pawn with my dark squared bishop on d6 and get my light squared bishop to b5."
489,21,14,1Bb3,b'r4rk1/pp1b2pp/8/3P1p2/1b6/1B6/PB3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',I think white should have advanced the pawn again cramping Black's position even more especially since this allows 19 ... Bd6.  However that is the perfect diagonal for White's light squared bishop.
490,21,15,a5,b'r4rk1/1p1b2pp/3b4/p2P1p2/8/1B6/PB3PPP/2RR2K1 w - a6',Trying to open up some room for my pieces and create counter-play on the queen side.  Gaining tempo by attacking the bishops was in my mind.
491,21,16,2a4,b'r4rk1/1p1b2pp/3b4/p2P1p2/P7/1B6/1B3PPP/2RR2K1 b - a3',Good but it only delays the assault
492,21,17,Bxb5,b'r4rk1/6pp/3b4/pb1P1p2/8/1B6/1B3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',This is the diagonal I had planned for my light squared bishop back on move 17 as it keeps the white king locked up and can become dangerous to White's rooks.
493,21,18,2Bc1,b'r4rk1/6pp/3b4/1b1P1p2/8/p1R5/B4PPP/2BR2K1 b - -',? This is the only seriously questionable move by White that I see in the game allowing the following tactic and moving the dark-squared bishop off of its best diagonal.  25. Ba1 looks stronger.
494,21,19,2Be2,b'r4rk1/6pp/3b4/3P1p2/8/p1R5/B3bPPP/2BR2K1 w - -',Winning the exchange but at a high positional price.  I think this is still the best move though.
495,21,20,2d6+,b'r4rk1/6pp/3P4/5p2/1b6/p1R5/B2RbPPP/2B3K1 b - -',9 ... f5 comes back to haunt Black now as the pawn advances with check forcing the black king far out of the action
496,21,21,Rac8,b'2r2r1k/2R3pp/3P4/5p2/8/p7/B2BbPPP/6K1 w - -',Forcing the Rook exchange because of the threat of Rc2
497,21,22,3Bc3,b'2r2r1k/2R3pp/3P4/5p2/8/p1B5/B3bPPP/6K1 b - -',This gets the light squared bishop back onto its best diagonal.  White correctly declines the temptation to initiate the rook exchange and keep his passed pawn with a dark queening square (opposite of Black's bishop) as the succeeding threats of a back row mate would cause White much trouble and probably loss of material.
498,21,23,h6,b'5r1k/2P3p1/b6p/5p2/5P2/p1B5/B5PP/6K1 w - -',Trying to get that Black king into the game before it is too late

501,21,26,Re8,b'4r3/1bP3pk/7p/4Bp2/5P2/p5P1/B4K1P/8 w - -',The rook does not seem to have many present opportunities to exert influence even on the a file so zigzagging to e8-e7-d7 seems to be its best choice.
502,21,27,Bc8,b'2b1r3/2P4k/7p/4Bpp1/5P1P/p3K1P1/B7/8 w - -',This looks to be a wasted move.  Breaking up the king side for the Black king to invade with gxh4 looks better
503,21,28,Re7,b'2b5/2P1r2k/7p/4Bpp1/3K1P1P/p5P1/B7/8 w - -',This move is necessary for Black's breakthrough to succeed but it should have been made last move.
504,21,29,Kg6,b'2b5/2P1r3/6kp/2K1Bp2/5P1P/p7/B7/8 w - -',Black is now set up to break the king through and have queening threats on both sides of the board.  This looks like a winning position here.

506,21,31,4Kh5,b'2b5/2P1r3/7p/2K1Bp1k/2B2P1P/p7/8/8 w - -',??? Black blunders into the trap and hurts his position badly much better was Rd7.

Inviting the Q exchange Black hopes to establish a rook on the 7th whence he can haul in White's Q-side pawns: 25.Qxc2 Rxc2 26.Bc1 Rc8 with strong counterplay.  Of course to achieve this much activity Black hardly notices the loss of a second pawn...

The move played looks counterintuitive allowing White a protected passed pawn on the 5th rank.  Yet to protect the supporting a-pawn the b4-rook has to stay on the fourth rank.

From Black's point of view this is a material improvement on the two-pawn deficit but the price is high in terms of White's advanced pair of passed pawns.  Both sides still have a battle on their hands - White if he is to win; Black to save the game.
585,24,37,Kg8,b'2r2rk1/5p2/3p1bp1/BP1P3p/P3B3/4P1PP/q4P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',(!?) White was threatening 34.Qh5 but maybe this retreat was overcautious?  Black would have liked to play 33...Rc4 but 34.Qh5  looked unpleasant.  Now this line turns out fine for Black: 33...Rc4 34.Qxh5 ? Kg7 35.Qf3 Rxa4 and Black would have been well and truly back in the game.  But White can improve: 34.Bd3! Rxa4 35.Bc7 Be7 36.Qxh5  Kg7 37.Qf3.  Not quite so delightful for Black.  However 33...Kg7 might have been a better retreat in order to protect the bishop but I wanted to keep the g7-square open for its retreat should it become necessary.

Now a tremendous battle rages about White's passed pawns as Black's major pieces flood into White's Q-side.  Yet I wonder if Black might have been better advised to have sacrificed back the exchange by 35...Rb8 36.a5 Rxb6 37.axb6 Qxb5 38...Qxb6.  But White need not accept the bait: 35...Rb8 36.Bd4!

The f2-square looked an especially vulnerable spot.  The tension here is enormous - with a species of guerilla warfare taking place.  White has to combine his Q-side infantry offensive with home defence near his castled king whilst Black conducts commando operations behind enemy lines.

This might become significant later.

656,26,17,Be1,b'8/4k3/2p2ppp/np2p3/4P1P1/K2P1P2/4N3/4b3 w - -',Blacks plan to win is simple. Restrain the king threaten to exchange white's last piece and coordinate the knight and bishop to drive the king back into a corner if the exchange is declined.

The reason one usually develops knights first is that one usually knows more about where the knight wants to go early in the game than the best place for the bishop.  Here the reverse is true.

But Black is also thinking of bringing a rook to d8 with the possiblity of liquidating the tension in the centre.  All  pretty vague really.

The move played picks up a second pawn for the piece leaving Black with two passers and a reasonable amount of counterplay.  All the same White must have the edge here.

White will be left with B N vs R 2P - still a rough material equality but the isolated doubled b-pawn group is a real handicap.  White has to rely on piece activity to stay in the game.  And that's the rub for Black.  If those pieces get really active they could prove very dangerous.  Here follows a period of intricate manoeuvring.

At this point I was worried that White might be tough-minded enough to try 86.Nxa2 Rg2  87.Kc3 Rxa2 88.Kb4  leaving Black with a R b-P vs B endgame - notoriously difficult to win.  I spent quite a bit of time on this ending after 88...Ra8 89.Bg7 (say) Ra7 90.Bd4 Rb7.  Black's plan would then be to bring the K over to defend the pawn (no trivial task when the WK has access to c5!) so that the rook would then be free to clear a path to the queening square.  As it transpired the game would have been winnable but the process would have been a long one.

But isn't the simpler 99...Rh2 just as effective since there can be no posssible guard against Rh1 ?  There is a slight difference: 99...Rh2? 100.Bb2 Rh1  101.Kd2 Rb1 102.Kc3 (=).  Black's 99th move prevents the WK reaching the c3-square.
931,35,96,10Bb2,b'8/8/8/8/1k6/1p6/pB4r1/N1K5 b - -',Now that White has been driven in to his last lines of defence Black launches the final assault.

The move prevents the sharpest Yugoslav continuation of 10. Bc4 (with a slight move order change).  The most significant aspect of this move is that the natural response of 10. exd5 leads to a series of exchanges that White (wanting to win at all costs) would prefer not to occur.

Perhaps h4 in of itself was not too bad...but I started the theme and continued it until I realized it was wrong.

1097,39,4,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move doesn't look very good as it neglects development of black's pieces this early in the game.
1098,39,5,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Preparing to castle king-side also to place a rook on f1 to exploit the soon to be opened f file.
1099,39,6,Nh5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Trying to defend the extra pawn at the expense of falling behind on piece development is never a good idea. Even worse moving a piece twice; black would've been better off with something like 6...g5
1100,39,7,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p3p/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Taking the king out of danger and reinforcing a future attack on the f file.
1101,39,8,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/3pb2p/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Getting rid of one of the hostile attackers...
1102,39,9,Ne5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp3p1/3pp2p/4N2n/3PPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! This might seem like a simple knight exchange but accepting it wouldn't be a recommendable idea for black's position.
1103,39,10,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp3p1/3ppn1p/4N3/3PPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black has really no good alternatives...
1104,39,11,1Ng6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp3p1/3ppnNp/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Eliminating the possibility of castling king-side (which wouldn't be a very good idea anyway).
1105,39,12,1Bxf4,b'rn1qkbr1/ppp3p1/3ppnNp/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b q -',White pieces' movements flow naturally (LOL! Sorry I couldn't resist).
1106,39,13,1e5,b'rn2kbr1/pppq2p1/3ppnNp/4P3/3P1B2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b q -',Getting rid of that protector knight on f6 will be the beginning of the end for black.
1107,39,14,1Nxd5,b'rn2kbr1/pppq2p1/3pp1Np/3NP3/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b q -',Finally... White's queen will be very dangerous on h5 on the very next move.
1108,39,15,1Qh5,b'rn2kbr1/pppq2p1/3p2Np/3pP2Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b q -',Black is now in real trouble.
1109,39,16,1Nc6,b'r3kbr1/pppq2p1/2np2Np/3pP2Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w q -',If only that knight would've been moved there before (probably instead of 3...h6?).
1110,39,17,1exd6,b'r3kbr1/pppq2p1/2nP2Np/3p3Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b q -',15.Nxf8 would've been better!! Black can now castle and be away from danger. White would still have advantage though.
1111,39,18,1cxd6,b'r3kbr1/pp1q2p1/2np2Np/3p3Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w q -',?? Sure black was losing but this move seals the deal for a pretty combination...
1112,39,19,1Nxf8+,b'r3kNr1/pp1q2p1/2np3p/3p3Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b q -',!!
1113,39,20,1Kxf8,b'r4kr1/pp1q2p1/2np3p/3p3Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black could have resigned its queen in order to avoid the pretty mate that follows (black would still be losing badly though)...
1114,39,21,1Bxd6#,b'r4kr1/pp1q2p1/2nB3p/3p3Q/3P4/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Sure it's not something out of this world but these kind of checkmates are always enjoyable to play!
