0,0,0,e6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1p1p/2npp1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',My opponent has taken the game out of the book lines with this abnormal setup. Both white and black will now achieve the 3 opening goals. The position is not extremely open or too likely to open. This generally weakens the need to perform the 3 opening tasks very quickly so exceptions happen often.
1,0,1,d3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1p1p/2npp1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Not a bad move for me but a pyschological mistake. I continue to play my intended setup against black's best book moves against another setup. It is certainly a reasonable choice but 7.d4! takes advantage of the only imbalance in the position: White is better developed. The center will open quickly to white's advantage. 
2,0,2,Qe1,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bnp1p/2npp1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Here 8.d4 is the best move. It would look very foolish to play it after 7.d3 and would clearly show that I knew my original plan was not best. Generally when one player goes with a setup or plan that is second best he will go on with it even if another plan is better. It is psychologically hard for many players to avoid this even though it would be better for their game.
3,0,3,1Kh1,b'r2qk2r/pp1bnpbp/2n1p1p1/1BppP3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QR1K b kq -',The waiting move is preparing for the king safety on the diagonal but 10.Qf2 going along with the plan was the best move. 
4,0,4,b5,b'r2qk2r/4npbp/p1b1p1p1/1pppP3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPPB2PP/R3QR1K w kq b6',The plans for both sides are clearer. White will attempt to close the position maximally and to provide support for the knights over the bishops. Black should open up the position for the bishops but only after he has caught up in the development and safety of the king. You can tell the correct plan in an instant by looking at the position and looking at the motifs and ideas for both sides.
5,0,5,h5,b'r2qk2r/4npb1/p1b1p1p1/1pppP2p/5P2/P1NP1N2/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w kq h6',(?)Quite a big mistake and this weak move shows that black does not understand the correct plans for both sides. The move looks like an attempt to attack against my king or place the bishop on h6. Neither of them go with the correct and are clearly not exceptions. Furthermore it allows white to have a clear move to finish the first step of the plan: Create outposts and good points for the knights.
6,0,6,1b4,b'r2qk2r/4npb1/p1b1p1p1/1pppP2p/1P3P2/P1NP1N2/2PB2PP/R3QR1K b kq b3',The strong move that takes control over d4 allowing the knights to favor the bishops.
7,0,7,1Ne2,b'r2qkb1r/5p2/p1b1p1p1/1p1pPn1p/1P3P2/3P1N2/2PBNQPP/R4R1K b kq -',Now the bishops are clearly inferior to the knights which means that my first step is over with. My next plan is to use my superior pieces to penetrate the position and attack in the middlegame. 
8,0,8,1Nxd4,b'r2qk2r/4bp2/p1b1p1p1/1p1pP2p/1P1N1P2/3P4/2PB1QPP/R4R1K b kq -',In the middlegame one needs to come up with an attack on weaknesses. If there are none one must improve their pieces to take advantage of possible weaknesses to be created. There is a weak a6 pawn and a good c5 square for a piece.
9,0,9,2Ra3,b'r2bk2r/1b1q1p2/p3p1p1/1p1pP2p/1P1N1P2/R2P4/2PB1QPP/1R5K b kq -',It is clear that black has nothing to do since his position is clearly worse. 
10,0,10,2Nb3,b'2rb1rk1/1b1q1p2/p3p1p1/1p1pP2p/1P3P2/RN1PB3/2P2QPP/1R5K b - -',So while black is shuffling his pieces around white is taking aim at the c5 and a6 squares. The plan is to further penetrate into the position.
11,0,11,a5,b'2r2rk1/1bq1bp2/4p1p1/ppNpP2p/1P1B1P2/R2P4/2P2QPP/1R5K w - -',Instead of going passively and waiting for me to complete my plan black sacrifices a pawn. Now white will have a concrete permanent advantage to convert. Thus he has in a way completed his plan.
12,0,12,3Qg1,b'b5k1/2q1bp2/4p1p1/1pNpP2p/1P1B1P2/3P4/2P3PP/6QK b - -',At first I clearly believed this endgame to be winning for white due to the easy way for white to protect all the points in his territory and the weak black king with opposite colored bishops. Now it is not so clear. The readers can say what they think.

17,0,17,Bc6,b'8/5p1k/2b1p1p1/1p1pP1Bp/1P1PqP2/2P3QP/6PK/8 w - -',White has the ability to control when he attempts to make progress. Although there is now clear way to proceed white needs to allow black to weaken his own position.

19,0,19,Be8,b'4b3/5p1k/4pBp1/1p1pP2p/1P1P1P1P/2P5/1Q4PK/4q3 w - -',(??)The blunder has happened and black has weakened his own position. Correct is 46...Qd1 not allowing the queen to penetrate along the a file. White would then have to attack the black king. 
20,0,20,4Qa3,b'4b3/5p1k/4pBp1/1p1pP2p/1P1P1P1P/Q1P5/6PK/4q3 b - -',Now the win is trivial and black's position crumbles.
21,0,21,5Qb7,b'8/1Q1b1p1k/4p1p1/1p1pP1Bp/1P1P1P1P/2P1q3/6PK/8 b - -',The bishop lacks mobility and will be lost.
22,0,22,5Qxg5+,b'8/2q2p2/4pB2/1p1pPkQp/1P1P1P1P/8/6PK/8 b - -',White won easily. But the question is could the game have been saved? White would seemingly have to take a risk sacrificing many queenside pawns to checkmate on the kingside or somehow penetrate on the a file. 
23,1,0,Qc7,b'rnb1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/1bPNP3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Both white and black are performing their 3 opening goals in these moves and the next so everything is going fine. Black plays to prevent white's e5 thrust which would disrupt black's game.
24,1,1,Nxc6,b'r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p1N1pn2/8/1bP1P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The correct idea when 2 pieces are in contact is to not take but to keep up the pressure. This move releases the tension and gives black a solid game. However it does not waste time.
25,1,2,1Kh1,b'r1b1k2r/1pq2ppp/p1p1pn2/8/1bP1P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1R1K b kq -',White's idea is to go with f4 and e5 and advance on the kingside.However this move should not be played because it does not develop the queen or help with the opening goals in a position that could become open. To be most active the white bishop can go to g5 and the rooks can be developed to the open files. Black suffers no problems here because he will be able to play e5 and develop nicely as well.
26,1,3,1e5,b'r1b1k2r/1pq2ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/1bP1P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1R1K w kq -',Now the bishop is opened. Castling can be delayed for one move.
27,1,4,1f4,b'r1b1k2r/1pq2ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/1bP1PP2/2NB4/PP4PP/R1BQ1R1K b kq f3',This move tries to take advantage of the white's slight edge in development. It is failing however because it allows black to take the initiative and develop with tempo. Before conducting an attack the best preparation is always necessary. Developing another piece would be the best move.
28,1,5,1Qg3,b'r3k2r/1p1q1ppp/p1p2n2/4p3/1bP1PPb1/2NB2Q1/PP4PP/R1B2R1K b kq -',(?)Now this is a concrete tactical mistake but takes some efforts to find why. This move creates tactical motifs that black can exploit. The d3 bishop is hanging by a thread since the queen has difficulty holding on to it. The f4 pawn is also under attack after ...Nh4 hitting the queen. If you use the right method of calculation here I am sure you can find the best move and the reason why. Here I used quite a lot of time and calculated the game right out to the line that happened in the game.
29,1,6,1fxe5,b'2kr3r/1p1q1ppp/p1p2n2/4P3/1bP1P1b1/2NB2Q1/PP4PP/R1B2R1K b - -',The correct challenging continuation for white as other moves lose the initiative and black starts getting the advantage. It is not tactically sound however. 
30,1,7,1Nh5,b'2kr3r/1p1q1ppp/p1p5/4P2n/1bP1P1b1/2NB2Q1/PP4PP/R1B2R1K w - -',(!)The correct first move in the sequence which wins the game by getting a decisive material advantage. Here by using the right method of calculation you will see that black wins nicely in the most challenging line with a nice trick at the end. Try to STOP and do it now. If you remember especially to calculate the most forcing moves at each variation the shocker to the opponent will not shock you very much.
31,1,8,1Bg5,b'2kr3r/1p1qbppp/p1p5/4P1Bn/2P1P1bQ/2NB4/PP4PP/R4R1K b - -',This is absolutely forced. 
32,1,9,1e6,b'2kr3r/1p1q1pp1/p1p1P2p/6Qn/2P1P1b1/2NB4/PP4PP/R4R1K b - -',(!)White plays in the most challenging way possible although this loses far more than other moves would. The winning move comes next. A shocking one but can be spotted easily once you calculate the most forcing moves first. As a note 18.Qh4 g5 wins decisive material as well. In the current position 18...hxg5 19.exd7+ Rxd7 wins at least the exchange. This should win the game as well but is not nearly as good as the best move.
33,1,10,1Ng3+,b'2kr3r/1p1q1pp1/p1p1P2p/6Q1/2P1P1b1/2NB2n1/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',(!!)And the opponent resigned since the queen is lost while the black queen escapes. The opponent here was rated 2100. It proves that you don't need to be able to visualize 10 moves ahead. The right way of calcualtion will help you play this way even if your absolute limit is 4 or 5 moves.
34,2,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here you can see that black is going to play defensive

43,3,2,Qe7+,b'rnb1k2r/pp2qppp/2pn4/8/1b1P1p2/1BN2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Black is being aggressive. It's normally good policy to tuck your King in a safe spot before launching an attack...

But what I didn't see was that even though I would be down a point in the exchange I would have 4 pieces against his three pieces and all of my pieces would be active and his king would still be stuck in the middle.. This is the possible continuation 16. Bb5+ Kd8 17. Rhf1 Nxd1 18. Rxd1.. Maybe it's worth the gamble or maybe not.. What do you think?

On the other hand you have provided plenty of support/control of the e4 space by playing that move which I think might have given me some trouble or something to think about later on. I don't remember right now."
279,14,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/3P1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Part of my reason for playing that is to develop my pieces and to gain some control of the center spaces on the board. I anticipated that you might kill my d5 pawn and I preferred to get your pawn in return with my knight rather than my queen. Part of that is because I like the position of my knight on d5. It seems a little awkward for you to chase away. If you killed my pawn and I killed yours back on d5 with my knight you would have two options of trying to attack my knight in his new position. One would be pawn to c3 which would put your d3 pawn in an awkward position of having to defend two pawns while having no pawn support of his own. The other option would have been your knight to c3. I would have taken that knight with mine and I believe you would have taken mine back with your b3 pawn. That wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for either of us but it would give you double pawns (two in front of each other) and it would leave your a2 pawn isolated (no comrade pawns in the adjacent lane) which is usually a weak position for a pawn. 

Another thing that came to my mind is if you take my d5 pawn and I take yours with my knight you would not be able to attack my knight with your bishop on f1  because you blocked it with your d3 pawn. I don't think that was necessarily a problem but I tend to not want to block my bishops by putting pawns on e3 or d3. On the other hand there are many people and situations where that does happen so I try not to hold onto that too strongly. It's something I keep in mind though.

"
280,14,2,Ne2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/8/3P1P2/PPP1N1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"I think that's a pretty good move in that you're developing your knight. If you bring your other knight to c3 that would make for a decent ""knight tag team"" where they're both supporting each other. It seems to make it safer for your b knight to come to c3 so that if I kill it with my d5 knight you could kill my knight with your e knight instead of a pawn which would give you a better position. 

Something I would keep in mind in this position is that the knight on e2 blocks the e2 space from both the bishop and the queen from moving htere and I would probably try to find an opening for the f1 bishop. Possibly by playing g3 at some point or re-opening the e2 space later if the opportunity arises. It would depend on how the play goes."
281,14,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/3P1P2/PPP1N1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Part of the reasoning was to develop my knight and gain more control of the center spaces e5 and d4 and on a milder level hoping to keep your d3 pawn from advancing to d4. I believe at this point I didn't necessarily prevent that opportunity entirely.
282,14,4,Nbc3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/2NP1P2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',At this point the first thought that jumps to my head is should I take your knight with mine? I don't want to because it would help your other knight make room for your bishop in my opinion. On the other hand I do like the location of my knight and wouldn't want you to sacrifice your knight for mine.
283,14,5,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NP1P2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I felt that this would protect my knight from being killed by yours because your knight is pinned to your king. You took care of that though in your next move.
284,14,6,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NP1P2/PPPBN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now I'm wondering should I just let those pieces be where they are? All those bishops and knights grouped up together. I can't necessarily see any gain in position for myself by attacking. On the other hand if I don't I anticipated that you would take my knight I'd take it back with my queen you might take my bishop with yours I'd take it with my knight. Then you might attack my knight which would then be on b4 with your pawn on c3 I would be forced to retreat and you would then possibly have a somewhat upper hand by forcing me to retreat and then moving again. Another reason why I think attacking my then-to-be knight on b4 with your c2 pawn is good is because it simultaneously opens way for your queen to move towards c2/b3/a4 should you choose to play it in that direction.
285,14,7,Nxc3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b6/2nP1P2/PPPBN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',For the previous reasons (at least in part) I chose to attack instead of wait for you to attack. I didn't foresee any necessarily better position for myself as a result of the sacrifice but preferred it to the alternative.
286,14,8,bxc3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b6/2PP1P2/P1PBN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"I was taken by surprise in that move because I was expecting you to respond either with your bishop or your knight. I think any of the three possible responds could have been fine and I don't know which one would be best although having played the one you did I think your move might have been better. Regardless of what the best move was I could say that I was taken by surprise by this move and being taken by surprise is usually not a good sign in chess even if it's not a hugely impactful move. This move reminded me to stay alert. 

Although on some level a part of me is saying ""that gives him double pawns and leaves his a2 pawn isolated"" another part is saying that's a pretty clever pawn structure. It paves way for you to move your d3 pawn towards d4 if you choose to do so. It also controls both d4 and b4 which were previously potential spaces for my knight to travel to. It's a good reminder for me not to be biased against doubled pawns which manytimes comes in handy. And your a2 pawn although isolated still isn't necessarily in a bad position because he's still supported by your a1 rook which I believe doesn't need to be moving anytime this soon in the game anyway. 

Although whether or not this would create an awkward situation for your a2 pawn later in the  game because it's dependent on a stronger piece to keep it safe (rather than any pawn) I can't say for sure....it's something I wonder about though.

Now i'm thinking what should I do with my bishop? My first reaction was to be indignant and drive my bishop further into the board by bringing it to a3. I  don't see how that could be benificial except in that it blocks your a2 pawn from moving (called a ""blockade"") which might not be so bad actually. 

Other considerations I had were bringing my bishop back to d6 or e7 but for some reason in my experience bishops on d6 (or e6 for the white bishop) usually ended up awkwardly for me. I was never quite able to put my finger on why and it's definitely not a rule or something I read anywhere just a feeling I developed and I have no idea whether or not it makes sense. 

I didn't want to put my bishop on e7 because I was preferring to keep the diagonal from d8 to h4 open for my queen. It still wouldn't have necessarily been a bad move in my opinon because it creates a line of bishop action on that diagonal while supported by my queen.

I liked bishop to a5 because my bishop would be pretty safe there because you have no more pawns that could attack it on that lane and because if you ever chose to move your c pawn you would need to consider whether or not you were ok with my sacrificing my bishop for yours. Also if you chose to move your bishop from d2 or your knight from e2 you would require keeping the other piece in place to defend that pawn from my bishop. I don't know for certain that I'm not reading too much into things and that my analysis makes sense but bottom line for me was it seemed like the best avai"
287,14,9,Ba5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/b3p3/8/2PP1P2/P1PBN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Although I had liked my knight and his position I found some relief in him clearing the D-lane for the queen to place more pressure against your d3 pawn against moving forward. I don't know why I keep focusing on that but for some reason that's where my mind goes.

I preferred not to keep my bishop there because if you took it I'd have to bring my knight to the wall and because of the knight's limitation of movement I tend not to want to bring them to walls unless there's a better reason. The second option would be to bring my bishop to b6. I don't know why I chose to trade bishops over that move. I don't think I was clear with myself on which of the two moves I preferred at the time I played it either.
289,14,11,Nd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2Pn4/3P1P2/P1PQN1PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',"I don't know what I was hoping for exactly by moving that knight. I think I wanted either to tempt you to take it with your knight which I could then take with my queen. You would be compelled to protect your rook and while you do that I would gain a bit of momentum to continue developing my position probably either by developing my Bishop on c8 or castling myself. Another option you might have had after we trade knights is for you to have played c3 to threaten my queen while protecting your rook (the computer analysis suggested rook to b1 as a means of protecting it). Not sure where I would have gone from there if you played c3 but it might have distracted me by putting me on the defensive.

I was anticipating that you might attack my knight with c3 at this point at which point I'd play knight to f5 or e6 I think. I believe part of the reason I wanted to move my knight around was to make room for my c6 pawn."

It might cause him to have dark square weaknesses later in the game.

I do not know why he advanced his c7 pawn but this turns out to be a serious blunder.  5...f6 or 5...g4 would have been better as they would have protected his g5 pawn.  Of all those choices however 5...g4 would have been his best move because 5...f6 would create dark square weaknesses so it would weaken his position.  However I am going to take a free pawn when I play 6.Bxg5.  Therefore I will be a point ahead as he cannot recapture with 6...Qxg5 or 7.BxQ due to my DSB.   I could also capture with 6.Nxg5 but I will capture with my DSB to attack his queen.  That way he will be forced to retreat his queen so he will loose an important tempo while I come up with other plans.  What are my plans?  That will be answered shortly.

Otherwise Qxb2 followed by QxN loosing my b2 pawn and b1 knight at best.  Therefore I would be a piece behind instead of a point ahead.

This will give me a serious strategical advantage in this position.  That is because I am now beginning to plan a mating assault against him.  In other words I am trying to figure out an inevitable mating sequence against him.  For that reason this is where I begin to think way in advance.  In addition I will be thinking harder throughout the entire game for every move.  That is until I finally find an inevitable mating pattern against him.

He can't move either knight to directly threaten my queen because of my black bishop or placement of his other pieces.  He can either move his queen up to e2 or move his f3 knight followed by his f2 pawn to put his e4 knight to shoo me away.  Three moves at this stage while I get to continue to develop is a bad choice so I think white made the best decision here.  However none of this discussion would be taking place if white had castled instead.  Wasted moves early in a match can spell big trouble very quickly.

343,16,16,1cxd4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp5/7p/5pp1/2pPp3/8/PP1PKPPP/R1B3NR b kq -',Double and isolated pawns in the middle of the board are no one's friend.  White has one developed pawn lost his ability to castle and has all of his remaining power pieces in their starting gates.  How did we come to this place?  White overextended his pieces and allowed me to mercilessly pawn march them back into their holes.  You have to move your pieces out smartly.  I honestly think that the 6th and 7th moves by white are what got us here.  Instead of doing proper development white took a more haphazard approach to development and now he is down a staggering amount of development.  The game isn't completely over yet but it's about to get ugly quickly.  I can get all of my remaining pieces into play without any real constraints and black still has a ways to go to try and catch up.
344,16,17,1Nh3,b'r3kb1r/ppp5/4b2p/5pp1/2pPp3/7N/PP1PKPPP/R1B4R b kq -',I looked at where white was and this was the safest development choice but I don't think it was the smartest.  White is going to have a hell of a time getting his bishop into the game while the c4 pawn is in its location.  Perhaps Rb1 in preparation for a pawn push to get your bishop into the game?
345,16,18,1Re1,b'2kr1b1r/ppp5/4b2p/5pp1/2pPp3/7N/PP1PKPPP/R1B1R3 b - -',It might have been better to move Rb1 and then trade pawns so his bishop can get into the game and connect his rooks.  Despite the fact that white is woefully behind in development he is still only down one pawn (for a little while longer).  If he can get his pieces into play he is still in the game.

348,16,21,1Kg1,b'2kr3r/ppp5/4b2p/5pp1/2pbp3/7N/PP1P1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',White still has almost no development.  It would have been better to keep the king where he was for the past two moves and get his other pieces into the game.  Moving the king away more doesn't offer any hope of regaining momentum or trying to get back in the game.  It looks like a series of moves just prolonging an inevitable death.

Now white gives up the knight for free only slightly inconveniences black and provides a portion of a potential future mating net for his own king.
353,16,26,2f4,b'2kr3r/ppp5/4b2p/4bp2/2p1pP2/6Pp/PP1P3P/1RB1R1K1 b - f3',too little too late.

Although the d pawn is weak and isolated and now white can reconnect it with his brethren on a-b this move still provides black with more material gain and more importantly opens up the d file to a double rook attack.
356,16,29,2Re2,b'2kr3r/ppp5/7p/5p2/2bbpP2/2P3Pp/PP2R2P/1RB2K2 b - -',Note that this pin is only possible because of white's previous blunder by giving up the knight for free.
357,16,30,Bb6,b'2kr3r/ppp5/1b5p/5p2/4pP2/2P3Pp/PP2K2P/1RB5 w - -',In retrospect I should have moved to g1 instead to eat white's h and g pawns.  However we can't make the right moves all of the time.

361,16,34,2Rd1,b'2kr4/ppp5/1b5p/5p2/P3pP2/2Pr2Pp/1P1BK2P/3R4 b - -',A blunder.  At this juncture it would have been better to move the bishop to e1 and cede the h/g pawns as lost.
362,16,35,2e3,b'2kr4/ppp5/1b5p/5p2/P4P2/2Prp1Pp/1P1BK2P/3R4 w - -',A crushing play that ends the chapter on this game.  The major learning points from the game are to develop smartly.  You can lose a game in the first few moves and white's moves 6-7 are a good example of this principle.  Instead of seeking shelter for the king white made unnecessary moves that laid the early foundation for his defeat.  Once he did get to a point where he was forced to trade queens to keep his king alive I was able to pawn march his pieces back into their starting places seriously restricting his overall development.  When the pawn march had finished white became obsessed with protecting his king with a manual castle instead of finding a way to get his other pieces into the game.  The rest as they say is history.

However Black is aiming for Nc6 which I think is a very dangerous move for White. White would have to thread a very thin needle to stay in the game at all (Qxd5 may work). Even then a Knight on c6 is only two moves away from c2 attacking the Rooks. Obviously White's a1-Rook needs to get into play (I'm thinking c1 or d1) but that brings us back to the Bishop.
I considered Be3 ... but that begs the question 'Why did you move the Rook to e1 in the first place if you're going to block it with a Bishop?'
I ended up with Bf4."

This attacks my Queen (immediate issue) but also opens the d8-h4 diagonal ... giving Black's Queen a route into White's K-side.

Anyway the Queen could fall back to d1 2 or 3 and still have a playable position. The e-5-pawn is not in wonderful shape but doesn't need the Queen for protection at the moment.
So ... I don't think I need to move the Queen right at this moment. There may be something more useful on this move.

Na4 looks interesting. From there it could drop into b6 (as long as White's Queen stayed on d4 (which ain't going to happen as Black will play Nf5 anyway) or c5 blocking the c6-pawn. c5 might be a nice little outpost ... especially with a3 and b4 as protection. Just thinking out loud here.

Maneuvering my Rooks behind my advanced pawns will be very difficult with Black's light-squared Bishop still on the board ... as will freeing my King should the need arise.  If I can get my Rook to d2 or d4 then the forward d-pawn will be a bit more secure.  Whatever the case Black is getting ready to play Rd8 but the d-pawn is (for a move or two) covered by White’s Bishop ... but then the pawn can’t move forward without a Rook backing it up.
However with the Knight coming into play I have to make sure I get the Rooks and King are on different colored squares ... hummm three pieces and two colors ... that really is going to be a trick!
The second choice is Be5 ... but there an eventual f6 (backed up by something of course) forces it away maybe back to where it is now.  So that’s sort of a bust.  Although the Bishop really lacks any scope where it is it seems to be doing its limited job fairly well.
And that brings us to a4.  Not a great move ... but it does protect the b-pawn.  And now that I think about it ... Black is going to drop the Knight onto d4 threatening Nxb5 or Nc2 forking the Rooks.  So to keep from dropping the pawn White has to cover it this move.  I think a4 does that.  Black obviously has a lot of optional responses ... but at least it works for one move.

In retrospect I failed to realize how powerfully Black's Bishop was positioned.  Re3 was again the best move.

You ought therefore to push your king's pawn upon his castle and even sacrifice it because your adversary by taking it opens a free passage to the pawn of your queen which you are to advance immediately and sustain in case of need with your others in order order to try to make a queen with it or draw some other considerable advantage from it to win the game. It is true that his queen's pawn being now on the same line with its king appears to have the same advantage of having no opposition from your pawns to make a queen; however the difference is great because his pawn being entirely separated and incapable of being joined to or sustained by any of the others will always be in danger of being seized on is road by your pieces continually warring against it. This move as has been before observed is very difficult; and one must be already a good player to judge well of it.

I was playing in a MT called New Year's Eve Party which was hosted by Master Chrisobee.  I found myself playing against a Master called Klauno (Klaus) and after he responded to my 1. e4 with the Sicilian (c4) I decided to play the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack and we ended up in Easy 19's Experimental Demolition Derby Attack line which involved a queen sac.  Unfortunately it went belly up for me but I thought I would annotate it so that whoever wants to be the white player in this line can see the refutation.

Also partly as a result of being beaten too many times on the black side of this at Sheffield University by Peter Large. It is quite acceptable to take to pawn however if black follows it up correctly.
626,26,6,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/4P3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is about the only sensible move here.

I remembered a game from my university days where I continued with f5 but it seemed to me that f5 left my d pawn backwards and if I later played d6 or d5 to stop it bein backward he could just play e5xd6 and my e pawn was backward. I didn't want to leave his e5 pawn unmolested it could form the basis of a king side attack. Why not play d6 now? Yes that's what I'll play. Now according to Harding and Barden ""Black can equalise with Taimanov's 7....f5"". I did find out later that f5 does score better for black and is more popular although d6 also scores well for black."

Maybe my move I played is an improvement? This position also came up in Stein Bernd (2380) vs. Kovalev Andrei (2500) where black continued with Be8 and won although Be8 seems to me to be undeveloping and breaking the rule of not retreating a piece to the back rank to break the connection of your rooks.
