I have taken a trip down memory lane again this time I have gone back to my very first game I played on gameknot.  This game ended happily for me.  My opponent played the Alekhine's Defense.  Nf6 in response to my 1. e4.  When I joined Gameknot it was to keep my hand in while easing my way back onto the OTB tournament circuit so I played the game as much as possible like an OTB one - no database and no analyse the board - instinct only."

23,1,6,1Qa4+,b'rnb1k2r/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2b5/QqP5/2N2N2/3BBPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',"Ion had this to say about my 15th move - 15.Qa4ch is a fine move that at least maintains you material and temporal advantage. Black ought simply to have exchanged queens as you took full advantage of 15...Bd7. However even better than 15.Qa4  it seems to me was 15.Nb5 (While I think of it 15.Nd5 was also worth a serious look but let's stay with Nb5 for now). Look at the mess Black is in! Where is the queen to go? 15...Qb2 16.Bc3 and all Black's heavy pieces are en prise or under heavy threat. And the Black king is about to become a widower. So the queen has no escape. Can Black create one a move earlier? 15.Nb5 Bxf2ch(!!) creates a ""luft"" for the queen and gains a tempo for the loss of a piece. Now I suppose one's first thought for White would be to retake with the rook often it is worth thinking about alternatives. Retaking with the king guards to e3-square so that if (16.Kxf2) Qc5( ) 17.Be3 maintains a terrible crimp on Black's game and now White has 2 pieces for 3 pawns. By the way the analogous line after 15.Nd5 goes 15...Bxf2ch 16.Kxf2 Qc5  17.Be3 Qd6 (or ....Qc6) 18.Nb6! Or: 16.(Kxf2) Qd6 17.Bb4 Qd8 18.Be7 Qd7 19.Nf6ch (Ooooo you nasty thing!)

25,1,8,1Bxb4,b'r3k2r/pp1b1p1p/n3p1p1/1N6/1BP5/5N2/4BPPP/R4RK1 b kq -',ID. An interesting point arose after Black's 17th (...Na5). Now 18.Bxb4(!) is probably the best: forcing large scale exchanges whilst preserving your material edge. But did you consider 18.Rxa6!? as an alternative attempt to exploit the forking possibility at c7? (18.Rxa6!? bxa6 19.Nc7ch Kd8 (forced) 20.Nxa8 Bxd2 21.Nxd2 Bc6 22.Bf3 etc. White increases his material advantage. But the story doesn't end there. Suppose Black were to play (17...Na5 18.Rxa6) ...Bxb5(!). Then 19.cxb5 Bxd2 (Of course 19...bxa6 20.Bxb4 gives White 3 minor pieces for a rook - an overwhelming advantage) 20.Ra2 and White still has a minor piece for 2 pawns but Black has a bishop (opposite squares to White's at that) rather than the knight. On balance then I prefer your game continuation. But 18.Rxa6?! was definitely worth a look!

Bb4 Black had a rook pawn too hard to defend and contrived to lose an extra piece into the bargain. However spirited Black's subsuquent counterattack you were never in very serious danger from it given sufficient alertness. All the same 26.Ne5! called for fine judgement and accurate play. You were always in a position if necessary to bale out with g3 or h3 but your hold on the initiative meant you never were called upon to do so (how early did you spot that knight manoeuvre to e3: when you played it to e5? If so: not bad especially as not only did it stop Black's mating threat cold meant that in trying to avoid an exchange of rooks lost one for nothing to stop -slow down- your own king hunt. I also liked the choice of 4 checkmates in the final position...

My Opponent is not very strong but I just needed to annotate another game so I can get the feel of what I'm doing. If you guys have any tips for me to help me with my annotating or calculation it would be much appreciated. Again this is only my second annotation so it won't be very good. The game isn't so good either."
117,5,1,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Usually play continues 3.d4 and then 4.e4 yet my opponent chooses e4 and never plays d4. Most likely a lack of experience on his part.
118,5,2,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',? A bad move. Developing the bishop would have been much better after d4. Now the d-pawn is blocked and white must spend another tempo to move the bishop.
119,5,3,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq c6',I was thinking 5...e5 but with the absence of the pawn on e4 I figured I could give my bishop a strong diagonal and at the same time avoid the troublesome Benoni pawn structure granted to white in the usual King's Indian game.
120,5,4,Qc7,b'rn2k2r/ppqbppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/1QNB1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Not the best move in my opinion. I should have went 7...a6 before as the immediate qc7 is threatened by nb5. I would have to retreat my queen wasting tempo as 8.nb5 bxb5 9.cxb5 gives white the two bishops and strong queenside play.
121,5,5,Nc6,b'r3k2r/ppqbppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/1QNB1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Again a6 was probably better.
122,5,6,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/ppqbppbp/2np1np1/2pN4/2P1P3/1Q1B1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',This brings my bishop to a powerful square and clears the center. Although I lose a pawn I get excellent spacial compensation and at the same time I hinder  White's development.

The threat is qxf2 and although his next combination wins the rook it loses the game as it does not stop the threat.
127,5,11,Qg1#,b'Q7/p2b1p1p/3p2pk/2pP4/2Pb4/3P4/PP4PP/4RBqK w - -',My opponent's poor development was an enormous factor. Because he was so underdeveloped I was allowed more space particularly the central dark sqaures. In this case his dark square weaknesses strengthened my bishop greatly. In chess you want to bring your pieces to their best squares possible. The point of this is that when your pieces are on strong squares their mobility is greatly enhanced granting them a crushing influence on the enemy camp.
128,6,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This game features a nice attack with my favorite variation of the Sicilian Najdorf. I never have any problems playing Sicilian as Black and I've upset a lot of high rated players with Sicilian. I quit playing e4 a long time ago when I couldn't find any good openings against Sicilian. This is only my theory and you can disagree but Sicilian is just good for Black if Black plays completely accurately. Excuse my bold statement about this position being winning for Black but I am very serious about my Sicilian. Although the opening only matters if both sides play 100% accurately throughout the game which no players will so you can play whatever opening you want if you're not a grandmaster but if you're looking for a sharp opening against e4 that you'll never want to quit playing then I advise you to go over this game and learn to play Sicilian the way I do I explain a lot of my sicilian repertoire throughout this annotation.
129,6,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"Against moves like this that don't reveal White's plans I recommend the standard 2...d6 adding control to the central dark squares. White has committal moves like f4 and c3 where Black needs to play differently than he would against the non-comittal moves.
Against 2.f4 Black should play 2...g6 immediately and develop like Dragon since playing in the center will allow White's f4 to have a purpose. Against Dragon setups f4's only purpose is to play f5 attacking g6 which isn't anything to be afraid of and is why f4 isn't advisable against Dragon. Black can develop and castle quickly in the dragon setup and take advantage of the f4 weakness later.
Against another comittal move 2.c3 I recommend the most common response 2...Nf6 since White has blocked his own knight from developing to c3 Black's knight on f6 will be stronger when White cannot control the same squares with Nc3 anymore so White almost always plays 3.e5 and after Nd5 d4 cxd4 Nf3 Nc6 Black's play will pretty much all be on the queenside where he has both knights there and lots of flexibility and it will take White awhile to develop play on the kingside while his pawns are slightly overextended.
"
130,6,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"I think this is sharper than the other common moves. 2...Nc6 takes away the option of developing the knight to d7 2...g6 commits to fianchettoing the bishop too early and 2...e6 blocks in the bishop and the only points I see to 2...e6 are to block the g8-a2 diagonal and prepare for a d5 boost. Black can block that diagonal with e6 anytime and early d5 is not necessary in the Sicilian so to me 2...d6 is the only logical move and Black will wait to see how White responds to decide what kind of setup to play.
The lines after 3.Bb5  Bd7 Bxd7 Qxd7 tend to be somewhat equal but with a slight advantage for Black."
131,6,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White decides that the only chance to fight for advantage is to take away Black's control of d4 while opening up the position with a lead in development but Open Sicilian to me is easier to play against than the annoying anti-sicilians where the plans are unclear. Against lines where White delays or doesn't play d4 then Black has many ways of getting an at least equal position usually with a slight advantage. Against early Bc4 Black can develop normally with e6 a6 Nf6 Be7 and because of e6 and a6 the bishop is useless on that diagonal Black can continue development Nc6 Bd7 and his position is completely solid with queenside expansion ideas. Against non-committal moves like Nc3 Black can just play Nf6 and White will almost have to play a committal move like d4 and go into mainline. If White plays passively then Black should go into a Dragon setup and have an advantage. Dragon is only bad when played against a 100% accurate Open Sicilian but not against passive play by White. If you don't know dragon well and don't want to study it then e5 is playable in some lines.
132,6,4,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Qxd4 is a sideline here but it is nothing to be afraid of. Black can simply play a6 stopping Bb5 and then Nc6 attacking the queen with tempo. Black can play a dragon setup which is good against almost any passive play by White. 
133,6,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black usually wants to play e5 but if e5 immediately then Bb5  then Nf5 is annoying. Black should catch up in development and control the b5 square before playing agressively
134,6,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White has passive moves like Bd3 or f3 where White doesn't want Nc3 so he can play c4 and go into a Maroczy Bind. Against the passive moves that defend the e-pawn Black could just go ahead and play e5 to exploit White's passive play since the Bb5  Nf5 moves are not effective when Black can play the d5 boost with a strong center.
135,6,7,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"This is the key position of the Sicilian Najdorf and where White has a lot of options.
Against Sozin Attack 6.Bc4 Black should play e6 blocking the diagonal and White usually plays Bb3 to stop b5-b4 winning a pawn. Black gets a solid comfortable position after developing Be7 Bd7 Nc6 and the f6-knight can retreat to e8 if it ever gets harassed by g4-g5.
Against the agressive 6.Bg5 Black needs to play slightly defensively and develop e6 Nbd7 Qc7 b5 Bb7 to solidify everything and make sure White cannot penetrate. Black needs to be aware of potential sacrifices in that line such as Nf4 enticing exf5 opening the e-file before Black castles and Nxb5 sacrifices that leave the queenside wide open. There are a lot of cheap sacrifices in the 6.Bg5 line that Black needs to foresee but if you develop like I said then Black catches up in development and White's position is slightly messed up because of the early attacking attempts
Against 6.f4 Black should play 6...g6 like dragon since like i said before f4 is not good against dragon and playing in the center with e6 or e5 allows f4 to have a purpose.
Against 6.Be2 and other passive moves Black can play almost anything and be at least equal with moves like e6 or e5. But I recommend g6 against this move also since dragon setups are good against passive moves and the way I see it Black gets the useful a6 move in exchange for White's wasted Be2 move."
136,6,8,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is the mainline and usually a signification that White wants to play f3 (stopping Ng4) Qd2 O-O-O and attack on the kingside. Here White delays f3 so that Ng4 is tempting but Ng4 isn't good White can play Bg5 and Black's knight is out of place or even Bc1 and offer a draw if Black retreats his knight back. The moves against the other varitions like g6 and e6 aren't sharp here. Dragon is not good against a 100% accurate open sicilian while e6 is too passive and allows moves like g4. The reason e6 is good against moves like Bc4 and Bg5 is because Black needs to play solidly to stop the early cheapos and can take advantage of White's dubious bishop moves later. Against Be3 and f3 White doesn't have any early cheap shots and is closer to castling queenside so Black needs to play agressively to prepare for a quick queenside counterattack.
137,6,9,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq e6',"White's knight has 4 squares to go to and White usually plays 7.Nb3 preparing to defend where he will castle. 7.Nf4 can be exploited with Bxf4 and then d5 Black gives up the bishop pair to get a strong center which isn't a problem since White's bishops can't do much and Black has an extra knight. 7.Nde2 is a rare move because it blocks the paths of two pieces and Black can play Ng4 because if bishop retreats then Qb6.
Against 7.Nf3 I recommend Qc7 stopping Bc4 and Black usually gets an advantage if he succeeds in making the d5-pawn break that can be prepared after b5 Bb7 Nbd7 Nb6 and Rd8 if needed. Black also might want to play Be7 earlier so that he can castle in one move when needed."
138,6,10,Nb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The only downside to this move is that Black gets a quicker queenside attack after b5-b4-a5-a4 since a4 will be played with tempo. White could still decide to castle kingside in which Black can employ the same ideas in the 7.Nf3 variation where he plays for d5 except now the bishop can be developed Be6 instead of Bb7 since the knight isn't on f3 to harass the bishop with Ng5.
139,6,11,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black has the idea of playing for d5 in the passive lines but should not be done now since Qd2 O-O-O owns the d-file in which the d5 boost would benefit White. Black needs to just castle immediately and wait to see what White does. If White goes for a cheap attack g4 then Black can go ahead with the d5 boost now that he is better developed and ready to castle. Play could continue g4 d5 g5 d4 gxf6 Bxf6 and Bh4  is coming if White doesn't play Bf2 in which dxc3 leaves White with doubled isolated pawns in the endgame
140,6,12,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Once again if White plays g4 phish attack attempt then d5 is good for Black.
141,6,13,Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',b5 is also playable here but i like to complete development before I start attacking. So far this is still main line now both sides will pawnstorm toward the others king and then it's a matter of whose attack is completed first. Black's attack looks more promising since Black gets 2 tempo moves (b4 and a4) while White only gets 1 tempo move (g5) and the space is already clear for Black's major pieces to dominate the queenside files while it will take White a little more time to coordinate his pieces on the kingside.
142,6,14,b4,b'r2q1rk1/3nbppp/p2pbn2/4p1P1/1p2P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - -',This is sharper than retreating immedeiately. If you are familiar with lines of Calishnikov then you know gxf6 is not advisable because after bxc3 Black's open files to White's king are more dangerous than White's open g-file since Black can just defend g7 with moves like Ne8 and Bf6 and Black can push the a-pawn
143,6,15,Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/3nbppp/p2pb3/4p1P1/1p2P3/1N2BP2/PPPQN2P/2KR1B1R w - -',The old main line was Nh5 which stalls White's play on the kingside but modern theory prefers Ne8. Black should get all his pieces coordinated in the attack rather than trying to stop White's attack. BLack's knights will get good outpost squares and Black's attack is quicker the way Black's minor pieces are coordinated they both defend the kingside and prepare to attack on the queenside.
144,6,16,1Ng3,b'r2qnrk1/3nbppp/p2pb3/4p1P1/1p2P3/1N2BPN1/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - -',"14.Qxb4 is dubious because once again Black's open files on the queenside will be of more use than White's open g-file after Bxg5.
This is where my book line knowledge dies down because I am more familiar with the main line h4 in which Black plays a5-a4-a3 and gives White a weakness on the dark squares. I wasn't familiar with this line and wasn't sure if I should be afraid of Nf5. "
145,6,17,1a5,b'r2qnrk1/3nbppp/3pb3/p3p1P1/1p2P3/1N2BPN1/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - -',After 5.Nf5 a4 White's knight has to retreat to a1 and also a2 hangs and the e7 bishop isn't important at the moment so White pretty much has to play Kb1 so the knight can retreat to c1. White has to defend during the middle of his attack while Black can just simply attack.
146,6,18,Nb6,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/p3p1P1/1p2P3/1N2BPN1/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R w - -',15.Nb6? bad move. I lack book knowledge in this line but I really should've played a4-a3 here but this move just seemed natural to me. 16.Nf5 is correct book move in this position and it scores good for White. After a4-a3 White has to respond to the threats and Black's attack gets dangerous while White has yet to pawnstorm and coordinate his pieces toward my king. but luckily White didn't play Nf5 so I maintain the advantage I had since the 1st move.
147,6,19,1f4,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/p3p1P1/1p2PP2/1N2B1N1/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R b - -',I don't really understand this move despite Nf5 being better White shouldn't be trying to break up my center since this is a double-edged attacking position. In lines where White plays f4 exf4 is almost forced since f5 is unpleasant.
148,6,20,1Bxf4,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/6P1/pp2PB2/6N1/PPPQ3P/1KNR1B1R b - -',White's opening the f-file hardly did anything for him. His isolated pawn is much weaker than mine and he has wasted a lot of movevs. Here I was considering a3 or b3. I wasn't comfortable after a3 because I don't think I'm in a position to take advantage of the dark square weakness i thought b3 was much sharper and White might accept the pawn sacrifice but now that I analyse the game in-depth I don't think the sacrifice would have worked out very well for me. But luckily White did not accept it.
149,6,21,1b3,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/6P1/p3PB2/1p4N1/PPPQ3P/1KNR1B1R w - -',The lines where Black plays a3 are more positional and Black should also have a knight ready to head for c3 I think b3 is sharper and a lot more interesting. Most players familiar with Calishnikov know that accepting this sacrifice isn't good and Black will mount up an attack on the files White opens after accepting the pawn. Don't be afraid to make this sacrifice if White accepts it then just attack whatever he weakens from accepting it and your attack will be annihilating. 
150,6,22,1cxb3,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/6P1/p3PB2/1P4N1/PP1Q3P/1KNR1B1R b - -',It's better to open the c-file rather than the a-file since the open c-file is not as dangerous Black's major pieces will flood the a-file if White opens it.
151,6,23,2a3,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n1pb3/6P1/4PB2/Pp4N1/1P1Q3P/1KNR1B1R b - -',White declines the sacrifice which is safer but I think accepting the sacrifice is White's best chance since now I have enough time to play the long awaited d5-boost which is the typical freeing break in the Sicilian and now I have the initiative
152,6,24,2d5,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n2b3/3p2P1/4PB2/Pp4N1/1P1Q3P/1KNR1B1R w - -',White still has the option of accepting the pawn but it is not advisable to open files to your king in a double-edged position even if it seems like Black has hardly any compensation taking the pawn could be regrettable in the future if Black gets a crushing attack.
153,6,25,2Qf2,b'r2qnrk1/4bppp/1n2b3/3p2P1/4PB2/Pp4N1/1P3Q1P/1KNR1B1R b - -',Maneuvering the queen to the open f-file while pinning the d-pawn exd5 next move could be dangerous with the queen on the d-file.

155,6,27,2Be3,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/1n1nb3/3p2P1/4P3/Pp2B1N1/1P3Q1P/1KNR1B1R b - -',This bishop has moved back and forth while my knights have landed on great outposts.
156,6,28,2Nbc4,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/3nb3/3p2P1/2n1P3/Pp2B1N1/1P3Q1P/1KNR1B1R w - -',White almost has no play on the kingside and his two pawns won't defend his king for long since only pawns have been exchanged and White has a lot of pieces out of play I can sacrifice a knight on a3 to finish the attack. I think Black should've taken the b-pawn earlier since he doesn't have much play on the kingside and it was the only chance to create an imbalance. Now taking the pawn is pretty much suicidal since I didn't have the Nxa3 idea before but White chose the wrong time to take the pawn because now Nxa3 is crushing.
157,6,29,Nxa3+,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/3nb3/3p2P1/4P3/nN2B1N1/1P3Q1P/1K1R1B1R w - -',White's only chance is to take the knight and try to defend. Playing like a coward and moving the king just lets me have the attack without losing any material.
158,6,30,2bxa3,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/3nb3/3p2P1/4P3/PN2B1N1/5Q1P/1K1R1B1R b - -',After my sacrifice the b-file has been opened to White's king so now my rook can take control of the b-file

White should now be focused on trying to hold onto as much material as possible. Defending with Rd3 allows dxe4 attacking the rook while attacking the knight again and after Qc2 dxe4 White cannot defend the knight any longer. Against Ka2 I can play d4 attacking the knight and bishop and I can continue the attack while recovering some material. So I think Kc2 is pretty much the only move. If White tries exd5 then Rxb3 Kc2 Qb8 with crushing attack or exd5 Rxb3 Kc1 Qa5! and White's king is surrounded by the major pieces. If exd5 Rxb3 Ka2 then I can play Rxa3 and if Kxa3 then Ne4   
160,6,32,Rxb3,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/3nb3/3p2P1/4P3/Pr2B1N1/2K2Q1P/3R1B1R w - -',Sacrificing more material to open up the king is okay when your opponent's pieces are out of play. I learned that from (bakerbaker) who has many attacking games annotated on gameknot. It was actually him who taught me his Sicilian repertoire and his theories behind it. I agreed with all his theories and he has taught me a lot of attacking strategies in the lines of our Sicilian repertoire
161,6,33,2Kxb3,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/3nb3/3p2P1/4P3/PK2B1N1/5Q1P/3R1B1R b - -',White's king is very exposed against my active pieces which are just ready to attack the helpless king. I analysed this variation when I first played Nxa3 and was planning to play Qb8  but now I saw Qa5 which might be better than my intended Qb8 . I couldn't decide between Qb8  or Qa5 so I decided to keep both queen moves options while increasing the pressure around the king
162,6,34,2Nxe4,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4b3/3p2P1/4n3/PK2B1N1/5Q1P/3R1B1R w - -',This knight doesn't really have anywhere to go to while it's still contraversial where my queen should go and this also frees up space for my dark bishop. White needs to make an important decision here whether to remove my knight controlling squares near White's king or to move the queen to help defend. I think it's better just to remove the knight since Qb8  will be deadly if the knight is left alone and has the potential to attack.
163,6,35,2Nxe4,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4b3/3p2P1/4N3/PK2B3/5Q1P/3R1B1R b - -',Trade passive pieces for active ones
164,6,36,2dxe4+,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4b3/6P1/4p3/PK2B3/5Q1P/3R1B1R w - -',White should save his rook so that I don't catch up in material so White can play either Kc2 or Bc4.
165,6,37,2Bc4,b'3q1rk1/4bppp/4b3/6P1/2B1p3/PK2B3/5Q1P/3R3R b - -',Kc2 is too passive and White's king is too vulnerable to all my tempo checks. Bc4 offers to trade an inactive piece for an active one even with White's king on c4 I think I'm probably still winning but the attack will be harder to carry out without my light bishop so I should increase the pressure of my attack.
166,6,38,2Qa5,b'5rk1/4bppp/4b3/q5P1/2B1p3/PK2B3/5Q1P/3R3R w - -',I have some major tempo threats now. Qxa3  Rb8  and Qb5  all continue the attack with tempo so White needs to see which threat is the most dangerous and if there is any way to defend. I think no matter how I continue the attack as long as I have tempo I should be able to mate or recover more than enough material.
167,6,39,2Bxe6,b'5rk1/4bppp/4B3/q5P1/4p3/PK2B3/5Q1P/3R3R b - -',White cannot stop all my tempo checks so he trades while giving the king more breathing space. But now I can exploit my awesomely placed queen.
168,6,40,3Kc2,b'5rk1/4bppp/4B3/6P1/4p3/q3B3/2K2Q1P/3R3R b - -',logically White's king will be in less danger when it is not in the center but it doesn't matter how White continues my queen just dominates the entire queenside.
169,6,41,3fxe6,b'5rk1/4b1pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/q3B3/2K2Q1P/3R3R w - -',Rc8  will have devestating consequences now that the bishop isn't controlling anymore so White's only chance is to sacrifice the inactive queen for my rook that is ready to attack but that lets me catch up in material.
170,6,42,Bxf8,b'5bk1/6pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/q3B3/2K4P/3R3R w - -',Here I have a queen and two pawns for two rooks and my pawn on e4 is very strong compared to the other pawns on the board. The two rooks are often stronger than the queen in wide open positions where the rooks are coordinated and have other pieces aiding them but here the rooks are not in any position to attack and the rooks are horrible defenders. White would probably prefer to have a queen than the 2 rooks since the queen would be a much better defender to oppose my queen.
171,6,43,3Bc1,b'5bk1/6pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/q7/2K4P/2BR3R b - -',My queen and bishop and pawn will reach full potential and complete the attack despite the lack of attackers. White's king wouldv'e been much more vulnerable on c4 since I'd be threatening Qb4# and if Bd2 in the position where White's king is on c4 then I'll have Qd3#

33.Kb2 loses to Bd6! and the bishop is invicible since the rook will be forked if it takes and then the threat of Be5  is dangerous with the followup of more tempo checks.
Here I was worried that after Kb1 there wasn't enough material left on the board to complete the attack but since White's rooks are horrible defenders I can make them useless and it's almost like I'm up an entire queen."
174,6,46,3Qb3+,b'5bk1/6pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/1q6/7P/1KBR3R w - -',I will play e3 next move stopping the Rd2 defense 
175,6,47,3Bb2,b'5bk1/6pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/1q6/1B5P/1K1R3R b - -',After Ka1 e3 the rooks fail to defend since disconnecting the rooks often allows rook-forking tactics. Either my pawn will advance to e2 and cause severe annoyance to the rooks making it so that they cannot interfere with my bishop's completion of the attack on the h8-a1 diagonal or I will win a disconnected rook.
176,6,48,3Rd2,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/6P1/4p3/bq6/1B1R3P/1K5R b - -',checking will give White a temporary sense of power but it really just lets my king get a free move.
177,6,49,3e3,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/6P1/8/bq2p3/1B1R3P/1K5R w - -',Pretty much any rook move reaches the same doom. When there are material imbalances you must use your imbalance to the fullest potential and two rooks for a queen is not a good imbalance when the rooks are defending. 2 rooks tend to be a very strong attacking combo while they are useless defenders.
178,6,50,Qd3+,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/6P1/8/3qp3/1R5P/1K5R w - -',The queen dominates the rooks while the pawn is close to promotion so it's pretty much over now. If Ka2 then Qd5  forks. If Kc1 then e2 and the king is badly placed it stops the rooks from defending the promotion square and allows the Qc3  tempo idea controlling the promotiong square not to mention the king is more exposed to rook forks. Rc2 is also bad because of Qe4 threatening the rook and there's the Qb4  idea that threatens the promotion square with tempo so after e2 White really can't stop the promotion tactic or he'll lose a rook.
179,6,51,3Ka1,b'6k1/6pp/4p3/6P1/8/3qp3/1R5P/K6R b - -',White decides his king should be furthest from the action but my pawn is too strong White cannot save this position.

273,10,7,O-O,b'1rbq1rk1/p2nbppp/2Q5/4p3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The White knight moves and the quest for a pawn have resulted in a position where white has succeeded in gaining two pawns; but at a terrible price:  All of Black's pieces are mobilized White has four pieces still requiring development and has the White queen afield.  
274,10,8,1Nc3,b'1rbq1rk1/p2nbppp/2Q5/4p3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Not a good move.  It develops the knight to it's natural square but allows it to be pinned and neglects the Queen which can come under attack by four pieces.  Withdrawing the Queen may be prudent.
275,10,9,1Rb4,b'2bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2Q5/4p3/1r6/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This allows Bb7 without blocking the rook.  At this post the rook takes away three escape squares from the White queen and holds the b-file.

279,10,13,1Qe3,b'6k1/pb1nqppp/8/8/1r2p3/3PQN2/PPr2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Obviously White cannot take the invading rook but the e5 pawn remains pinned.  
280,10,14,1Nf6,b'6k1/pb2qppp/5n2/8/1r2p3/3PQN2/PPr2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black protects the pawn a fourth time and positions the knight to attack the black queen.

282,10,16,Nb4,b'6k1/pb2qppp/8/8/1n2N3/3P4/PPr2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',The start of the final assault.
283,10,17,2O-O,b'6k1/pb2qppp/8/8/1n2N3/3P4/PPr2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',White begins his development much too late.
284,10,18,2Nxd3,b'6k1/pb2qppp/8/8/4N3/3n4/PPr2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',
285,11,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Playing Black is my friend Baker who always seems to get positions where he is down lots of material and still wins.
286,11,1,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',So far these are the opening moves of the standard King's Indian Defense. In Indian Defenses such as Nimzo and Queen's Black does not challenge White in the center with pawns and instead goes for rapid development and only challenges the center once he is completely developed. 
287,11,2,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This important move stops e5 and the central break after castling will either be an e5 boost or c5 boost depending on what kind of position you want.
288,11,3,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This is where Black decides which way to challenge the center. The c5-boost is usually better in lines where White makes kingside progress such as in the 4-pawns attack or Saemisch. In this line which is mainline King's Indian Black usually plays e5 but c5 is just as fine which can transpose to a Maroczy Bind or Benoni structure.
289,11,4,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',The line dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4 usually favors Black since opening the position usually favors whoever is castled and less weakened.
290,11,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This is the most common move. Against 7.d5 Black wouldn't be able to develop the knight to c6 but can then take advantage of the c5 weakness with Nfd7 Na6 which contains White's queenside while Black still has lots of flexibility on the kingside.
291,11,6,Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This move differs from the main line. Usually White wants to gain space on the queenside quickly with pawn pushes and delays the maneuvering of pieces for a few moves. Against moves like 9.Nd2 and 9.Ne1 Black cannot play the agressive Nh5 which is a typical move in mainline king's indian. In this line Black should move the knight somewhere else to prepare for the f5-boost.
292,11,7,a5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1npbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - a6',Baker wanted to take advantage of the fact that White didn't play b4 but then decided that a5 wasn't necessary and that he should've been making plans on the kingside. I disagree and I think a5 is good because White had to make 2 preparing moves in order to play b4.
293,11,8,Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppnnpbp/3p2p1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Knights tend to have the most flexibility on e7 and d7 (or e2 and d2) but moving them there early is passive and can usually be taken advantage of. Wasting 2 knight moves (Nf6 Nc6 Ne7 Nd7) to get the knights to these flexible squares is not really a waste of tempo and are actually common maneuvers in openings like Ruy Lopez or other closed positions
294,11,9,Kh8,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnnpbp/3p2p1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',At first glance this move seems awkward and Black could do better by playing f5 now and starting a kingside attack. The main reason for this move is to play Rg8 during the attack so it's better to play Kh8 before the attack because Black won't want to make a move like Kh8 during the middle of his attack. But I don't think Kh8 is that necessary this early in the game.
295,11,10,f5,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/3p2p1/p2Ppp2/1PP1P3/P1N5/3NBPPP/1RBQ1RK1 w - f6',Now it's time for Black to start the pawnstorm with f5 followed by f4 and g5.
296,11,11,1f3,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/3p2p1/p2Ppp2/1PP1P3/P1N2P2/3NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',bxa5 isn't good because it trades a pawn for a less valuable pawn and also isolates the a-pawn. White solidifies his structure but has also blocked the bishop's diagonal from interfering with Black's kingside play.
297,11,12,1Nb3,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/3p2p1/p2Pp3/1PP1Pp2/PNN2P2/4B1PP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',White has pressure on the a-pawn so Black traded pawns. I thought b6 was better.
298,11,13,g5,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/3p4/3Pp1p1/1PP1Pp2/1NN2P2/4B1PP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',The play of the position is clear. Both sides will attempt to break the pawn chain from the base of the enemy's pawn chain by maneuvering minor pieces to help with pawn advances and attacking. It's only a question of who can generate the most activity and break the chain more effectively.
299,11,14,1Bb2,b'r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/3p4/3Pp1p1/1PP1Pp2/1NN2P2/1B2B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',c5 looks sharper but this bishop has to develop sometime. Baker and I analysed the interesting idea of Bd2-Be1-Bf2 which isn't really bad for White just an awkward maneuver. But I think the bishop would be better on f2 even though it takes 2 extra moves.
300,11,15,1Nf6,b'r1bq1r1k/1pp1n1bp/3p1n2/3Pp1p1/1PP1Pp2/1NN2P2/1B2B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Even though Baker moved his knight back and forth it was needed to boost the f-pawn and now the knight needs to come back to help with the h5-g4 boost
301,11,16,1Nd2,b'r1bq1r1k/1pp1n1b1/3p1n2/2PPp1pp/1P2Pp2/2N2P2/1B1NB1PP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',White's knight has also moved back and forth. The knight isn't much good on b3 so White remaneuvers it to c4 to pressure the d-pawn.
302,11,17,1Ng6,b'r1bq1r1k/1pp3b1/3p1nn1/2PPp1pp/1P2Pp2/2N2P2/1B1NB1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',It's important that Black doesn't play g4 too early and sets the pieces in attacking positions beforehand plus it leaves Black more flexibilty if he doesn't want to play g4 and instead h4-h3
303,11,18,g4,b'r1bq1r1k/1pp3b1/3p1nn1/2PPp2p/1PN1Ppp1/2N2P2/1B2B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',This is probably stronger than the h4-h3 idea since it'll be hard for Black to make the g4-boost without support and also the Kh8 move is only useful if the g-file will become opened.
304,11,19,2Nb5,b'r1bq1r1k/1p4b1/3p1nn1/1N1Pp2p/1PN1Ppp1/5P2/1B2B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',White puts pressure on the weak d6-pawn and Black's only ways of defending are Ra6 and Ne8. Ne8 has the interesting idea of saccing the g-pawn to open up lines to White's king but Ne8 also wastes so much tempo with that knight so Ra6 is better. 
305,11,20,2Ra6,b'2bq1r1k/1p4b1/r2p1nn1/1N1Pp2p/1PN1Ppp1/5P2/1B2B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',If White takes the pawn then Black wins two pieces for a rook and pawn. 2 pieces for a rook is often a crushing advantage in the opening the minor pieces have superior mobility in positions with lots of pieces on the board and the fact that there are 2 attacking forces vs. 1 is also important. The advantage of 2 pieces for a rook isn't as strong in the endgame where the rook has lots of open space and where the rook's extra pawn is stronger. This position is clearly not an endgame and not an open position.

So far Black has excellent minor piece activity and pawn play on the kingside and it's just a matter of time before Baker activates his queen. Black's only problem piece is the rook that needs to defend the base of the pawn chain. Once the base of the chain falls usually the pawns behind it fall too.
307,11,22,2Bd7,b'3q1r1k/1p1b2b1/r2p1nn1/1N1Pp2p/1PN1Ppp1/5P2/1B2B1PP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',Black wants to kick off the annoying knight to relieve the pressure on d6. White still cannot take d6 because Rxd6 Nxd6 Qb6  wins two minor pieces for a rook.
308,11,23,2Nc7,b'3q1r1k/1pNb2b1/r2p1nn1/3Pp2p/1PN1Ppp1/5P2/1B2B1PP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Obviously Qxc7 loses to Nxe5. This is where the game kicks into high gear and the players should take their time. It seems that White's queenside attack is quicker than Black's kingside pawnstorm so Black must take drastic action. Black's rook is seriously out of play and has no influence on the kingside attack and the rook can no longer defend the d-pawn. Black can play Ra7 and Nxd6 is impossible because of Ba4 but after b5 intending b4 Black's rook is pretty much restricted from the a-file and trapped if Ra2 then Qb3 so Black is subject to loss of material. Black's only advantage is the kingside space so he must milk it for all it's worth and ignore White's threats on the queenside.

Baker thinks he is in trouble so it's do or die on the kingside from here.
311,11,26,2Ne8,b'3qnr1k/1p1b2b1/N2p2n1/3Pp2p/1PN1Pp2/5Pp1/1B2B1PP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',This move both defends d6 while preparing to attack with Qh4. It actually seems like Black is good here since there is loads of pressure on the kingside and White's material advantage is not exploitable in a position where almost every piece is still on the board. After Black's rook is gone White's queenside doesn't seem dangerous anymore it was just the pressure on the rook that was dangerous.
312,11,27,2h3,b'3qnr1k/1p1b2b1/N2p2n1/3Pp2p/1PN1Pp2/5PpP/1B2B1P1/2RQ1RK1 b - -',"hxg3 is suicide after fxg3 followed by Qh4. White would've had to play h3 anyway after Black plays Qh4 so he might as well play it now. Black's only way of breaking through is sacrificing more material with Qh4 Bxh3. We were curious to see how much compensation Baker had for the rook so we put this position into Rybka (a powerful chess engine like Fritz) and it said that it was winning for White which is expected because of the material advantage but after leaving Rybka analysing for hours we came back and the analysis had changed to totally winning for Black after the computer saw the attack Qh4 Bxh3 and then Black's piece infiltration Nh4-Bf6-Rg8. We couldn't believe that Rybka found no defense for White but we didn't let the computer analyse every position in-depth so it's possible that Baker misplayed the attack and given White a defensive resource at some point. It is amazing that White is up a rook in this position yet a chess engine claims that this is -  ""totally winning for Black"""

Another defensive option is Rf2 giving back the sacrificed material but that just opens up White's king and Black can choose to recover all the material since a6 is still hanging.
315,11,30,Nh4,b'4nr1k/1p4b1/N2p4/3Pp2p/1PN1Pp1n/3B1Ppq/1BR5/3Q1RK1 w - -',White can't stop g2 then Bf6 and Rg8 are coming to increase the pressure while White's pieces are pretty much useless to defend and a material advantage is only important when the extra material is actually attacking.

I think White has better defensive options like Kf2 or Re1 instead of still attacking on the queenside. After Re1 Nxf3 is not advisable because of Qxf3 and White has enough pieces for the queen.

Since Rff2 loses to mate Re1 is the only way White can save the rook. That defense fails since play could continue 31.Re1 Nxf3  32.Qxf3 Qh1  33.Kf2 Bh4  and White is lost because 34.Ke2 loses to Qxe1# and 34.Qg3 loses to Bxg3  35.Kf3 g1=N# double-check and mate. (35.Ke2 still loses to Qxe1#) Play could also continue 31.Re1 Nxf3  32.Kf2 Bh4  33.Ke2 Bxe1 and White will have to sacrifice the queen to stop g1=N# not to mention Black can promote to a queen after.

320,11,35,3Rg8,b'4n1rk/1N6/3p1b2/3Pp2p/1PN1Pp1n/3B1P1q/1BR2Kp1/3Q1R2 w - -',"This threatens 32...g1=Q 33.Rxg1 Qh2  34.Ke1 Rxg1  35.Bf1 Ng2  White is lost and play could continue 36.Rxg2 Qxg2 where Black has almost caught up in material and the tactical threats such as Bh4  and Rxf1# will cause Black to gain more material. After 35...Ng2  White could also move the king to the 2nd rank instead of taking with rook Black plays 36...Ne3  winning in any case. If White's king ends up getting to c1 like after 36.Kd2 Ne3  37.Kc1 then Rxf1 threatens Rxd1# and Qxc2# and Black will gain more material than was sacrificed.
If White's king ends up getting to c3 after Ne3  then the simple Nxd1  gains back more material than was sacrificed since Black already gained a rook after Qh2  If White's king goes back to e1 after Ne3  then the knight is attacking the f1-bishop so Rxf1# is mate."

327,11,42,3Kd2,b'4n2k/8/3N1b2/3Pp2p/1PN1P3/3B1prq/1BRK2p1/6Q1 b - -',The king is too vulnerable to stop the pawns. White's only chance is Rc1  which is the only other piece that can defend the promotion square.
328,11,43,3Nxd6,b'7k/8/3n1b2/3Pp2p/1PN1P3/3B1prq/1BRK2p1/6Q1 w - -',Black shouldn't play Qh1 because Qxh1 gxh1=Q Nxe8 and White has 3 pieces for the queen and Black's other pawn cannot promote Black should just snap off this knight first so that White only gets 2 pieces for the queen.
329,11,44,3Ne3,b'7k/8/3n1b2/3Pp2p/1P2P3/3BNprq/1BRK2p1/6Q1 b - -',After Nxd6 Qh1 Rc1 Black has Bg5  and the rook is gone then White has Bxe5  winning Black's rook but promotion is unstoppable without White's rook so Ne3 is White's best chance. If Rc1 instead of Ne3 then Black can snap off the knight defending that diagonal.

333,11,48,Kg8,b'6k1/6r1/3n3Q/3Pp2p/1P2P3/3BN2q/1BRK4/6q1 w - -',Now White's only check is Qe6  forcing queen trade. If White makes a defensive move like Nd1 then he has underestimated the power of the major pieces against White's exposed king
334,11,49,4dxe6,b'6k1/6r1/3nP3/4p2p/1P2P3/3BN3/1BRK4/6q1 b - -',This is critical. White has two pieces and a pawn for the queen usually material advantages where the stronger side has less pieces are harder to exploit and White is threatening Bxe5

336,11,51,4Kd3,b'6k1/4r3/3nP3/4p2p/1P2P3/3KN3/1BR1Bq2/8 b - -',This threatens Bxh5 better than taking e5 which just opens the position more for Black's major pieces.
337,11,52,4h4,b'6k1/4r3/3nP3/4p3/1P2P2p/3KN3/1BR1Bq2/8 w - -',This pawn is very valuable and Bxe5 is nothing to worry about without the passed h-pawn White could maybe manage a draw.
338,11,53,4Bg4,b'6k1/8/3nr3/4B3/1P2P1Bp/3KN3/2R2q2/8 b - -',White can hold on longer by going all out to stop the h-pawn and the position is more complicated for Black to figure out how to win but the advantage of queen vs. knight and bishop is enough to win even without pawns.
339,11,54,4Qxc2+,b'6k1/8/3nr3/4B3/1P2P1Bp/3KN3/2q5/8 w - -',But White didn't realize that this trade wins more simply for Black

342,11,57,4Bf3,b'6k1/8/3n4/4r3/1P2P2p/3K1B2/2N5/8 b - -',The bishop is the only thing stopping promotion so Black must somehow block the diagonal or force the bishop away

349,11,64,5Ne3,b'6k1/7r/4PK2/1n6/1P6/4N3/8/8 b - -',If e7 then Rh6  forces the king away and Black can stop and win the pawn this would be much harder to win if White's knight was a bishop since he could waste moves and not get into zugswang that easily. But the knight is better than the bishop at helping pawns promote which is White's last chance to swindle
350,11,65,5Nd6,b'6k1/7r/3nPK2/8/1P6/4N3/8/8 w - -',This knight must stop the strong passed pawn
351,11,66,Rb7,b'4n1k1/1r6/4P1K1/3N4/1P6/8/8/8 w - -',this could be considered zugswang White would probably prefer to pass his turn if he could

354,11,69,Rxe7,b'4n1k1/4r3/6K1/8/5N2/8/8/8 w - -',This seems like resignable position but it could still be tricky to win especially since both players were in time pressure
355,11,70,Re1,b'4n3/5k2/8/3N1K2/8/8/8/4r3 w - -',The technique is simple Black uses zugswang tactics to force the king away Black just has to use simple chess logic and the game wins itself.
356,11,71,Nd6+,b'8/5k2/3n4/5K2/5N2/8/8/4r3 w - -',Here Baker stopped writing his moves down because of time pressure but I'll continue the game just for fun.

However spacial advantages are very hard to convert to wins. I felt confident that I have a winning position here. If I am patient than I will slowly increase my advantage. 

The technique of converting a space advantage is as follows:

1. Restrict your opponents moves. Make him feel like a python is around is nest. The more he struggle the tighter the restriction. 

2. The Breakthrough. By virtue of your opponents cramped position he will eventually create a weakness in order to create breathing room. This opens the position up for a breakthrough that most of the time is done through a sacrifice that creates a permanent serious weakness in the defense of the king.

3. Winning combination. 

So How can I restrict my opponent. 

This is the best move that I can see. Any other moves allows white to exchange the pieces. After which my small space advantage dissolves. This however restricts White's queen. White can not allow Black to play Qd3.

464,15,6,Nc7,b'r1bqkb1r/1pnp3p/2p1pnp1/p4p2/P2P1P2/2P1PN2/1P4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In closed positional positions you should always keep track of which squares are weakened after certain pawn advances and try to post a knight there. White's a4 inaccuracy has weakened b4 even though c4 also weakens b4 c4 controls d5 and now if c4 then b4 becomes extremely weak so a4 not only weakens b4 but also weakens d5 since the c-pawn is stuck securing b4.
465,15,7,b6,b'r1bqkb1r/3p3p/1pp1pnp1/p2n1p2/P1BP1P2/2P1PN2/1P4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I intended Ba6 trading my bad bishop for White's good one. If White doesn't want to trade then my bishop is good on the a6-f1 diagonal so White should just allow the trade.

My idea was Nd7 e5 but opening up the center would probably benefit White who is developed in a more orthodox fashion. If the position never gets opened then both sides will just be maneuvering pointlessly unable to find some way to generate play often in lifeless positions one side will get tired of the boring position start making pointless maneuvers and allow the opponent to make progress

In endgames with only minor pieces the maneuvering is usually slower and more strategic than most endgames.

495,15,37,Bxh4,b'8/5k2/4p1p1/NP3p1p/n4P1b/B1p1P3/6P1/5K2 w - -',Now I'm up a solid pawn which is usually enough to win in minor piece endgames where the bishops are on the same color but here White might be able to hold a draw since my king doesn't have an easy path to activity. All I need to worry about is not letting White promote and not letting him win my c-pawn for free
496,15,38,4Nc4,b'8/5k2/1n2pbp1/1P3p1p/2N2P2/B1pKP3/6P1/8 b - -',My advantage here is my extra h-pawn which can't be taken advantage of yet since I can't create a passed pawn with it I need to worry about getting my king active first

500,15,42,4Na5,b'8/8/5kp1/NPn2p1p/5p2/4P3/4K1P1/8 b - -',?? this is a blunder and his next move is even worse. Passed pawns are not that strong in minor piece endgames and you shouldn't rush to advance them. Advancing a passed pawn in a minor piece endgame may only win a piece and a piece is only equal to about 2 pawns in endgames like this pawns are valuable and White is neglecting his pawns
501,15,43,4fxe3,b'8/8/5kp1/NPn2p1p/8/4p3/4K1P1/8 w - -',Here White should probably take the pawn and maybe draw if he's lucky but White thought his only chance to draw was to rush the passed pawn and win my knight quickly but that brings his knight far away from the action while i can make progress with my pawns

504,15,46,5h4,b'1N6/8/5k2/6p1/5p1p/4p3/4K1P1/8 w - -',White can't make progress with his king since it's stuck sotpping my passed e-pawn while I have enough time to create another passed pawn with g4-h3 and the king won't be able to stop both of them the only question is can White's knight stop the pawns or am I unstoppable even if the knight was closer?
505,15,47,5Nc5,b'8/8/8/2N2kp1/5p1p/4p3/4K1P1/8 b - -',If the knight was a light-squared bishop then maybe White could draw by shifting the bishop along the a8-h1 diagonal but the knight is slow and can be kicked around so I don't think White has a chance here.
506,15,48,h3,b'8/8/8/5k2/5pp1/3Np2p/4K1P1/8 w - -',Now all of my pawns will be passed after White trades and his pieces aren't in a position to stop them
507,15,49,f3+,b'8/8/8/5k2/8/3Npp2/6Kp/8 w - -',White took on h2 here but actually his best chance is to take on f3 and then take the e-pawn after I promote which goes into the endgame of queen vs. knight which is an easy win to a skilled player but can be tricky if you don't know the technique. Hoping that I can't win queen vs. knight is just about all White can hope for now.

If it was my turn to move in this position then White can hold a draw by shifting his king on e2 and e1 and then moving two squares above me whenever my king goes to the same rank as the pawn and e2 Ke1 is also a draw since leaving the pawn defended is stalemate but since it's White's turn here he can't hold a draw since I have the opposition and I can force promotion

I can see your reasoning and in general one does try to place the pawns on squares opposite to those your bishop (or the enemy bishop) can visit. However with the pawn on g3 one thing you would have to watch for is the enemy Q getting to your back rank (whilst your own is off counterattacking say) checking your king. Your bishop interposes at f1 whereat the enemy bishop settles on h3 with mate to follow. The second consideration is safe squares for the bishop - squares protected by a pawn. Often bishops need such an anchor near the middle of the board in order to operate effectively. Finally the h3 pawn will give some protection should Black try to dislodge the bishop by advancing his K-side pawns. For that he would have to advance his king. Yes 29.g3 did good things for the bishop's mobility (though that proved to be a double-edged sword in the game!) but even after 29.h3 the mobility of your bishop would have been superior to that of your opponent's. After 29.h3 I'd be tempted to have just played Kg1-h2-g1-h2 and waiting for him to disclose his plan (seizing any oppotunity to capitalise if Black does something silly of course). At some point though White might have to be prepared to abandon the Q-side pawns in the interests of counterattack. This would have to be very carefully timed - almost certainly not before Black places his king on a dark square like g7 or h6. Passive defence alone is rarely sufficient for successful defence.

This variation is more positional since White's pawns are more solid and Baker and I both reccomend the positional c5-break over the tactical e5-break in variations where White moves his f-pawn early.
583,19,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ c6',Yes Black is offering to give up a pawn. Most players who know Saemisch well will not accept the pawn and instead play Nge2 hoping for cxd4 Nxd4 with a Maroczy Bind. If White accepts the pawn then Black gets a lot of positional compensation. After dxc5 dxc5 Bxc5 Nc6 White's position is cramped and Black has a big lead in development. If you know this opening well then you know that accepting the gambit is not advisable.

585,19,6,e6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',Black wants to open the e-file for his rook and free up some space. White can choose whether he wants to trade his e-pawn d-pawn or c-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Swapping off both e-pawns is not good because Black's open e-file will be stronger. 8.dxe6 Bxe6 9.Nb5 Ne8 is also comfortable for Black. (10.Bxc5 won't work because of Qa5 )

In this variation where White plays d5 early this is pretty much the only square to develop to. The idea of Na6-Nc7 planning a b5 advance takes too long and isn't that strong.

White is lost so now he needs to figure out which lines give him the most cheapo possibilities before he becomes totally lost in an unswindlable position. If N8xd6 then Bf6  Kg1 Qg4  and White cannot block with the knight so if Bg3 then Be3  Kf1 Bxe2   Kxe1 Rf1# and if Kf1 after Qg4  then Bxe2  Kxe1 Rxf2! and White's king cannot escape the queen and 2 bishops.

726,20,101,5Kf7,b'3b4/5k2/6p1/4KP1p/8/6PP/8/8 w - -',So I move the king closer.

735,20,110,5Kg4,b'8/8/6k1/8/6Kb/7P/8/8 b - -',White's best move since it keeps the bishop at bay.

743,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am not an e4 player but as this is a thematic Sicilian and I am a Sicilian devotee for life I jumped in feet first.  This game features a Shveshnikov Sicilian which my opponent plays well in the beginning however loses the thread and his game quickly falls apart.  The mating attack at the end is quite amazing.

752,22,9,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',"A hypermodern choice!  This anti-positional ""looking"" move has become a great favorite of mine.  Named after its discoverer Evgeny Shveshnikov this move weakens the d6-pawn creates an outpost for White on d5 and keeps the Black dark-squared bishop hemmed in.  So why play it?  Because of the imbalance of dynamic chances versus structual disadvantage.  Black will typically have the initiative.  Black will also typically have the two bishops.  These two factors go a long way in the respectability of this opening.  Some of the top level players who have employed this system: Topalov Kramnik Leko Carlsen Shirov and Radjabov."
753,22,10,Ndb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Although the Black knight is on f6 rather than the black pawn on d6 we slide right back into the main lines.

Nd5 b5 I decide to cash in on my opponents strategic inaccuracy.  More typical and best is 8...b5; 9. d5 Be7 when White's best move is 10. Bxf6.

White will then have the option of c3 (the better of the two) and c4 intending to play Nc2 and Nce3 to cement control of d5.  Black can then attempt an ...f5 break.
762,22,19,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/3Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Leaving the c4 square open however I played a little too automatically and again allowed my opponent to get back to the main lines.

This move is typical of the Shvesh as it activates the bishop and gets out of the way of a possible ...f5.  If Black had a pawn on ...b5 he would be golden!
765,22,22,1h4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1np4/3Np1b1/4P2P/N1P5/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ h3',A very weakening move which is probably not as good as the simple 12. Nc4.  I was getting a little ambitious here and got lucky that I didn't get punished later on.  If ...b5 were in there would be no way I would play this move.

On h6 the bishop can scoot back to g7 if necessary.  Since Black can beat any attack I decided to improve my position in other ways.  By getting my problem knight into the game via c4 and b6.
767,22,24,1Nc4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1np3b/3Np3/2N1P2P/2P5/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ -',This knight also pressures d6.

I have to evaluate this as a clear plus for White though.  Black really has no way to get at the White king and my pieces will come out quickly.  That knight on f5 is a beast too.

896,28,13,1Nc3,b'r1b1k2r/pp2nppp/2p5/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',13. Nc3! (a developing move and it challenges control of the d5 square).  I have now come through the opening unscathed and in fact I now have a slight development lead!  So far so very good!
897,28,14,1Be6,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',13. ........ Be6 (catches up with development) and so what do I do here?  Castle queenside!!

I have one obvious threat and one very dark hidden one which may bring my opponent and his Oh so snug as a bug King a very rude awakening if his bullying rooks gang up on my poor little d pawn gobble it up and he fails to create a luft!  I will leave any reader to guess what dastardly plans are afoot here!!!

I now look at the number of moves played and gosh I have survived the first 20 moves without losing material and am in an endgame!).  At least I have achieved something here and nobody not even Ion can take this away from me!  Can I keep this up until Move 30? If so this can be an even greater achievement!
906,28,23,2f6,b'5rk1/pp1r2pp/2p2p2/8/3P4/4R3/PP1R1PPP/2K5 w - -',20. ........ f6 (creates luft for his king).

There now follows an exchange of one pair of rooks and we are now in a rook and pawn ending by move 28).  Only two more moves to move 30.  Can I keep material even?  We'll see.
915,28,32,2Kc3,b'4k3/pp1r4/2p4p/6p1/3P1p2/2K2P2/PP1R2PP/8 b - -',29.  Kc3? (the king bolsters the d pawn).  But I think this is where I start to go wrong.  I have a nasty feeling that I would have been much better off playing Re2  followed by Kc3 if he does anything other than play Re7.  If he exchanges the final pair of rooks I may have been OK in the King and Pawn ending.
916,28,33,2Re7,b'4k3/pp2r3/2p4p/6p1/3P1p2/2K2P2/PP1R2PP/8 w - -',29. ...... Re7 and Ion grabs the e file just as I  feared!  This game has a bit of a parallel to the one I had with bolle1 (the other 2000  rated player).  I was all right until move 29 with him!!!

He plays his king to f7 - I think that he wants to reinforce his kingside pawns with it.  I play my pawn up to a4 to stop him playing b5 .  Ion now penetrates my position with Re1 (horrible!!!) and so I might as well swap off the pawns as planned.  I do this and we are now on move 33 with black to move.  I get past move 30 without losing material but I think that my position is going downhill but I could have still saved it if I had backed off my king instead of going for the queenside pawns).

I should have then played my king back to d4 and then my h pawn up to h3.  If Ion checked with Rc1 then I could play my king to b4 if then a4  I would then play Ka3 and if Ra1  Kb2).  Had I done all this I would have most probably earned half a point and 9 rating points big kudos!).  In hindsight however it is 20/20 vision!

I found out during the post-mortem with Ion that I did exactly what he wanted me to do!  This plan is far too slow as the next few moves will show.
920,28,37,Rxf3,b'8/K7/5k2/8/P4pp1/1P1R1r2/8/8 w - -',"42. ...... Rxf3! - here I threw in the sponge.

I made the resignation decision based on the following - although material is even I felt that he would win the race.  For a starters I could not exchange rooks as his f pawn would crown long before my a and b pawns could and they would get cleaned up fast!

So what if I don't exchange rooks.  My rook is skewered against my b pawn.  The only way I can save both is to play 43. Rd6   Ke5 44. Rb6  g3 45. Rb5   Kd4  46. Rb4   Kc3 (the checks run out!) 47. Kb7 g2 48. a5 g1/Q.  So that line loses can we try another?

There is but....

43. 43.Rd1 Rxb3 44.a5 g3 45.a6 g2 ... 
Now White can't play 46.Kb7 not while Black's rook occupies the b-file and Black would like to see this state of affairs continue preventing the pawn's promotion. {Typical case of dead wood at the top stymying young talent... ;-)}. Meanwhile ...f3 is threatened. Can White cover the king's attempt to clear the b-line? 46.Rd6ch Kf4 47.Rb6 g1=Q leaves the White rook pinned with a quick mate to follow.

There is a stalemate try that doesn't quite work: 43.Rd1 Rxb3 44.a5 g3 45.a6 g2 46.Ka8 f3 47.a7 f2 48.Rb1.  Now 48...Rxb1 is stalemate and Black can't promote either (e.g. 48...g1=Q 49.Rxg1 g1=Q stalemate). What to do? Simply: 48...Ra3 49.Kb8 g1=Q wins. 
There was a possibility in this ending that I would have to give up the rook for your a-pawn (the b-pawn having disappeared in the meantime) and my pawn pair having reached the 6th rank could not be prevented from promoting. 

So resignation justified.  Never mind good game!"

Controlling the center is one of chess's prime directives.  The move also opens a line for the development of the bishop on c1.  It slightly improves the queen's mobility as well and in chess mobility is power.

962,31,2,Bf4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',2. Bf4 is a finesse move.  White is planning on playing the London system but avoids the move order 2. Nf3 3. Bf4 for a reason that will become clearer later.  The bishop move seeks to increase white's control over the e5 square.
963,31,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Perfectly consistent.  The knight develops towards the center with an eye on the e4 square.

I'm not an e4 player and I haven't played 1...e6 since discovering the Sicilian however I can't resist playing in a French tournament.

Instead of 5. f4 leading to the Steinitz this move betokens the modern treatment of the Classical.  The idea is for White to create a ""super-center"" with c3 f4 and Nf3.  In these positions the standard break at ...f6 is not so good as it leaves Black with a terminally weakened pawn structure.  This is a fact which determines this game even though we leave book very early.  Anand has played this several times with great effect.

By exchanging the knight from c4 I keep the position simple and advantageous for the White pieces.  Black gets the d5-square for his pieces but I get the e4-square for my knight after I castle as a bishop capture on c3 would only strengthen my center and then Nd2-e4 would come anyway.  Black also has an isolated pawn on e6 which will be a problem later.  This capture seems like a good example of choosing to use superior technique over complications.

As the Black c-pawn is hanging I wasn't worried about 17...Bxc3; 18. bxc3 Nxc3; 19. Qxc4 Nd5; 20. Rb1 with quite a bit of pressure on the queenside and a nice outpost on d6 for the knight after Ne4-d6.  I also wasn't concerned with 17...Nxc3; 18. bxc3 Bxc3; 19. Rxf8  Qxf8; 20. Rf1 Qe7; 21.

The only two weaknesses of the Caro-Kann are that black usually is a little worse in the endgame and white has an enduring space advantage.

I play it from time to time to spice things up. If black can survive the first wave of attacks by white he can usually get good counter play along the g file. This is known as the Bronstein-Larsen formation.
 
Black's strategy is simple 1. Place the H rook on the g file where it will eye the weak g2 pawn. 2. Develop the bishops to the King side. 3. Prepare for a f6-f5-f4 pawn break. 3. Castle Queen side. Amass huge pressure on the g file by playing Qg5 or Qh5. Of course that is if he can do all that before white deals a quick blow! However as seen in this game Black has major weakness  but it is not easy for white to exploit it with accurate play. Thus after black endure the initial attack he can usually mount a sufficient attack along the G file or white's weak d5 pawn.
 
Black can also play exf6 moving into the Kornchoi variation. In that setup black has strong defensive and attacking chances. see this game for an
