We got a strange position out of the opening after which White applied some pressure for a while but eventually cracked under time pressure.  There's a rather comical ending too ...

way to do so immediately.  I was worried about 9...Ngf6 10. e5 dxe5 11. dxe5

risk but gave my opponent a second remote passed pawn and allowed her N to take
up a threatening position with c6 undefended allowing further disruption."

Personally I didn't trust my instincts on Nf6 preferring the ability to castle long over an awkwardly eventually placed king nearer the center (which I felt would be forced had it lost castling rights) than having a pawn at g7. However and as we'll later see I'm starting to doubt that this is actually a wise call in the long run...
89,2,24,1Qxe5+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p4/4Q3/2P3n1/8/PP1NPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',White is not about to pull a Grand Prix Queen gambit here. Pretty much forced. My opponent did comment toward me before shocked at what I was willing to risk here. What can I say though? It isn't always the case that attacking is the best defense so I needed this queen gone!
90,2,25,1Nxe5,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p4/4n3/2P5/8/PP1NPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',And finally it goes. I did realize I'm down a pawn but I felt my mobility could balance this as even. GK disagrees and puts me at even -1.15 at this point in the game.
91,2,26,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p4/4n3/2P5/6P1/PP1NPP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Both a good move and time to develop. This allows f4 and Bg2 followed by a good O-O.
92,2,27,1Be6,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/4n3/2P5/6P1/PP1NPP1P/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I'm not overly concerned at the moment and I set my sights on winning back the pawn.
93,2,28,1b3,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/4n3/2P5/1P4P1/P2NPP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Totally safe. I needed to find a different way to do this.
94,2,29,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/4n3/2P5/1P4P1/P2NPP1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',There were a few purposes to castling now though I see a possibility that this was premature. The king wasn't being threatened so it didn't need to go somewhere. I did see a way to launch an attack on the d rank after ...d5 but I had forgotten a very crucial fact: I have no initiative required for any attack...
95,2,30,1f4,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/4n3/2P2P2/1P4P1/P2NP2P/R3KB1R b KQ f3',And now comes the punishment for my eagerness. Yet the computer has improved to -.74...?
96,2,31,1Nc6,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/2npb3/8/2P2P2/1P4P1/P2NP2P/R3KB1R w KQ -',It doesn't like this spot favoring likely Ng4-Nf6. I was more focused on winning the d4 square.
97,2,32,1Bg2,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/2npb3/8/2P2P2/1P4P1/P2NP1BP/R3K2R b KQ -',White wins the long diagonal now and can castle either way at this point.
98,2,33,1Nd4,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/8/2Pn1P2/1P4P1/P2NP1BP/R3K2R w KQ -',Pointless... I should have at least played Bg4 first but I didn't.
99,2,34,1Rc1,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3pb3/8/2Pn1P2/1P4P1/P2NP1BP/2R1K2R b K -',Obvious.
100,2,35,1Bg4,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2Pn1Pb1/1P4P1/P2NP1BP/2R1K2R w K -',...And now I play it just for fun...
101,2,36,1e3,b'2kr3r/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2Pn1Pb1/1P2P1P1/P2N2BP/2R1K2R b K -',The knight needs to be defended now. But it hardly has any squares at this point where it just doesn't end up hindering the other pieces on the board...
102,2,37,1Rhe8,b'2krr3/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2Pn1Pb1/1P2P1P1/P2N2BP/2R1K2R w K -',So I opted to just pin the pawn onto the king and exploit it for everything it is worth there.
103,2,38,2e4,b'2krr3/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2PnPPb1/1P4P1/P2N2BP/2R1K2R b K -',Despite being so distant from the king while under a pin... it still stuns me how safe this move was. It's looking more and more likely that I need to fully back away soon.
104,2,39,2f5,b'2krr3/ppp4p/3p4/5p2/2PnPPb1/1P4P1/P2N2BP/2R1K2R w K f6',However... I did hatch a plan to punish the pin. White isn't going to just find his king at the queenside in a nice neat fashion so I found this as an effective way to expose it.
105,2,40,2Kf2,b'2krr3/ppp4p/3p4/5p2/2PnPPb1/1P4P1/P2N1KBP/2R4R b - -',-so White does something I usually elect to do when under pin pressure of my own. The king is in fact an actual piece that can defend others. My situation has gotten a lot more complicated now and I spent quite a few days thinking about my next move. I know what I really want to do: I want to find that rook I have at e2 forking the king against the knight or even maybe winning the bishop. Now how do I do this...?
106,2,41,2b5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1p3p2/2PnPPb1/1P4P1/P2N1KBP/2R4R w - b6',I kept staring at fxe4. I didn't like it because White could easily fend it off. d5 would been a way to torment the pawn further but it's null and void if this pawn is in the way. But this was a terrible mistake and likely the first of the two decisive blunders I made this match. I wasn't doing my pawn structure any favors in making this move. GK puts me at -2.34 here and I have to agree. It suggests Re6 (to counter a stacking of rook on the e file) though I wasn't ultimately concerned with this situation.
107,2,42,2h3,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1p3p2/2PnPPb1/1P4PP/P2N1KB1/2R4R b - -',My opponent as I figured was definitely more concerned with Black's grip on e2. 
108,2,43,2Bh5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1p3p1b/2PnPP2/1P4PP/P2N1KB1/2R4R w - -',Daring White to play g4 to stop me from holding the e2 square.
109,2,44,2cxb5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1P3p1b/3nPP2/1P4PP/P2N1KB1/2R4R b - -',They grab this pawn though to send the knight away. I'm seriously regretting my second-thoughts after my 21st move at this point. This game is becoming increasingly desperate with each bind I'm in.
110,2,45,2Nxb5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1n3p1b/4PP2/1P4PP/P2N1KB1/2R4R w - -',So away this knight goes....
111,2,46,2g4,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1n3p1b/4PPP1/1P5P/P2N1KB1/2R4R b - -',-and now White throws their kingside pawns at me again. Now initially I was planning fxg4 because my pawns were generally closer to the center to be able to disrupt the e-f pawn team. So at first I wanted to play that instead thinking I could equalize the material that way.
112,2,47,2fxe4,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1n5b/4pPP1/1P5P/P2N1KB1/2R4R w - -',But then I noticed something troubling. If fxg4 then hxg4 Bxg4 THEN Rxh7! And then all White has to do to divert my only defender of c7 would be playing a simple a4 so following Rxh7 would have to be Rd7. And this would have me with an awkward placement of rooks and I just did not trust that position at all.
113,2,48,2Bxe4,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p4/1n5b/4BPP1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R b - -',Oh. But look. h7 is being attacked anyway. Lovely. Now Black has a terribly weak response against White's 3 pawns to my one on the far side of the board. So fxg4 was likely the better move and this is where I feel is the second decisive blunder on my part for this match. What's going to happen next is probably clear to everyone at this point in the game...
114,2,49,2Bg6,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p2b1/1n6/4BPP1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R w - -',Dropped pieces are no longer an option in this match.
115,2,50,2f5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/3p2b1/1n3P2/4B1P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R b - -',Not that it matters. I am now down to -4.34 and it looks like there's no saving me anymore.
116,2,51,2d5,b'2krr3/p1p4p/6b1/1n1p1P2/4B1P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R w - -',I refuse to give up though. I've made it back through worse situations and there is ALWAYS the chance that I could force a draw. So I counter with pressure of my own.
117,2,52,2Bd3,b'2krr3/p1p4p/6b1/1n1p1P2/6P1/1P1B3P/P2N1K2/2R4R b - -',Not the best of ideas considering I forgot there were other stranded pieces left to consider...
118,2,53,2Ref8,b'2kr1r2/p1p4p/6b1/1n1p1P2/6P1/1P1B3P/P2N1K2/2R4R w - -',I felt the bishop was better in this case. GK hates this move sending me down to -7.11.
119,2,54,2Bxb5,b'2kr1r2/p1p4p/6b1/1B1p1P2/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R b - -',This was painful. I honestly don't know where I found the mindset to keep going.
120,2,55,2h5,b'2kr1r2/p1p5/6b1/1B1p1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R w - h6',I could complicate matters if I expose the king at least so I resume focusing my attention there.
121,2,56,2Ba6+,b'2kr1r2/p1p5/B5b1/3p1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R b - -',I still find myself cursing ever playing ...b5 in the meantime.
122,2,57,2Kb8,b'1k1r1r2/p1p5/B5b1/3p1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/2R4R w - -',My own king is looking awfully locked down at the moment. 
123,2,58,3Rc6,b'1k1r1r2/p1p5/B1R3b1/3p1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/7R b - -',And now Black is confined to the a8 corner. As I've said before this game just gets more and more dire for me but I wasn't going to let my determination in this match falter just yet. I still had some wild ideas up my sleeve to allow for a shot at returning...
124,2,59,3Be8,b'1k1rbr2/p1p5/B1R5/3p1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/7R w - -',This is the only move that continues protecting h5 while freeing my king.
125,2,60,3Rc5,b'1k1rbr2/p1p5/B7/2Rp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/7R b - -',White wants to stay close. Now watch what happens- White solved a lot of issues with a more active king so the turnabout I'm looking for actually happens with White's failure to keep mine locked down...
126,2,61,3c6,b'1k1rbr2/p7/B1p5/2Rp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P2N1K2/7R w - -',Secures d5 is guarded and allows further protection after granting the king the c7 flight square.
127,2,62,3Nf3,b'1k1rbr2/p7/B1p5/2Rp1P1p/6P1/1P3N1P/P4K2/7R b - -',White will now require the material advantage held to knock me back down. So out comes the knight a less predictable piece and I can feel my anxiety returning...
128,2,63,3Kc7,b'3rbr2/p1k5/B1p5/2Rp1P1p/6P1/1P3N1P/P4K2/7R w - -',But I still press on. I'm ONLY -4 after all... (Or -7.33 apparently.)
129,2,64,3Nd4,b'3rbr2/p1k5/B1p5/2Rp1P1p/3N2P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',So White elects to unravel my defenses starting with my own fall of the c6 pawn.
130,2,65,3Bd7,b'3r1r2/p1kb4/B1p5/2Rp1P1p/3N2P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',I'm not having any of it so I start maneuvering my bishop closer to the queenside part of the battle. But GK doesn't like any attempts of mine to try and trap White yelling at me right away that Rhc1 will end all my proceedings on the spot. ...To be honest I didn't realize it right away...
131,2,66,3Bb5,b'3r1r2/p1kb4/2p5/1BRp1P1p/3N2P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',...but neither does White and the trap has sprung! The first truly deadly blunder by my friend happens here and watch how wildly the tide begins to turn...!
132,2,67,3Kb6,b'3r1r2/p2b4/1kp5/1BRp1P1p/3N2P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',The computer prefers Kd6 but I'm not aiming for any more drawish maneuvers. My chance to end this material deficit is right here and now. Both the extremely powerful bishop and rook are under threat.
133,2,68,3Nxc6,b'3r1r2/p2b4/1kN5/1BRp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',And this horrible oversight is made... ending my strong defenses of d5 and winning my rook in the process but still there is another rook whose fate was just decided...
134,2,69,3Kxc5,b'3r1r2/p2b4/2N5/1Bkp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',This is no longer just a rook exchange. One of those other pieces are falling down- my dream has become a reality and I actually just might pull off a fighting chance for this game after all.
135,2,70,3Nxd8,b'3N1r2/p2b4/8/1Bkp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',The computer says this is a wild recovery slightly favorable for White now but claims that in the span of three moves each we have gone from an 8.62 lead all the way down to a mere .46. I no longer care about the outcome of this match because I already in my own mind won with this incredible turnaround.
136,2,71,3Rxd8,b'3r4/p2b4/8/1Bkp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',-which I then decisively blow here. I saw two possibilities and not the third one available; either this or Bxb5 following an Ne6+ fork killing my rook. I didn't see Kxb5 which now I can tell would have brought this game that much closer to a fighting chance for me...
137,2,72,3Bxd7,b'3r4/p2B4/8/2kp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',so because of my own rashness I must accept my punishment and battle five pawns with only two.
138,2,73,3Rxd7,b'8/p2r4/8/2kp1P1p/6P1/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',So I prepare to attack White thinking gxh5 can be neutralized effectively after Rf7...!
139,2,74,3g5,b'8/p2r4/8/2kp1PPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/7R b - -',-No too bad! 5v3 stands in place of 3v2. A very wise move by White and a terrible decisive oversight by Black. Suddenly I need another back rank piece (i.e. Kxb5!) and I know now that Black no longer has any hopes possible on winning this game.
140,2,75,3Kd6,b'8/p2r4/3k4/3p1PPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/7R w - -',But I can still try to draw this out. I'm only down two pawns.
141,2,76,3Re1,b'8/p2r4/3k4/3p1PPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/4R3 b - -',But no my best weapon (and most consistent mind you) has just been blocked out.
142,2,77,3Re7,b'8/p3r3/3k4/3p1PPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/4R3 w - -',After a very long time of thinking I think it's time to remove the rooks and hope to neutralize the kingside pawns in time before it's too late.
143,2,78,4Rd1,b'8/p3r3/3k4/3p1PPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/3R4 b - -',I was hoping White would try to avoid the exchange. GK claims the exchange obviously should have happened because after Kxe7 threats of g6 b4 and Kf3 would ultimately decide this match. But now I actually have a better chance...
144,2,79,4Re5,b'8/p7/3k4/3prPPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/3R4 w - -',My opponent was horrified after this move.
145,2,80,4Rg1,b'8/p7/3k4/3prPPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/6R1 b - -',And they blunder again. Now I have a pawn less to worry about and my king is welcomed into the battle once again. I can actually draw this match!
146,2,81,4Rxf5+,b'8/p7/3k4/3p1rPp/8/1P5P/P4K2/6R1 w - -',And they must now waste a move to a check.
147,2,82,4Ke1,b'8/p7/3k4/3p1rPp/8/1P5P/P7/4K1R1 b - -',White's advantage is clearly diminishing; The king should have approached not retreated.
148,2,83,4Ke7,b'8/p3k3/8/3p1rPp/8/1P5P/P7/4K1R1 w - -',Black must have an answer to g6 right here and now.
149,2,84,4h4,b'8/p3k3/8/3p1rPp/7P/1P6/P7/4K1R1 b - -',Probably fearing my own h4 but this costs White a tempo. I know that my next move matters...
150,2,85,4Kf7,b'8/p4k2/8/3p1rPp/7P/1P6/P7/4K1R1 w - -',But I blow it again! ARGH! Now the rooks can be forced off. Somewhere in here I also think there was a misclick as well but nonetheless. GK says that White should have forced the rook exchange in this match all along made possible again by this move...
151,2,86,4Rf1,b'8/p4k2/8/3p1rPp/7P/1P6/P7/4KR2 b - -',And here it is seized. My fire starts to die down... again.
152,2,87,4Rxf1+,b'8/p4k2/8/3p2Pp/7P/1P6/P7/4Kr2 w - -',Forced.
153,2,88,4Kxf1,b'8/p4k2/8/3p2Pp/7P/1P6/P7/5K2 b - -',And forced.
154,2,89,4Kg6,b'8/p7/6k1/3p2Pp/7P/1P6/P7/5K2 w - -',So I finally place my king on this square to stop these pawns from advancing but then I realize something horrible. The only piece that can capture h4 now is my king. But if it moves the g pawn promotes. My heart drops here. I realize now that quite simply I can't do anything meaningful in this game anymore. Kf7 was just such a terrible terrible mistake...
155,2,90,4Ke2,b'8/p7/6k1/3p2Pp/7P/1P6/P3K3/8 b - -',Not wanting to advance on the queenside yet White's final piece goes active again.
156,2,91,4Kf5,b'8/p7/8/3p1kPp/7P/1P6/P3K3/8 w - -',I bring about a bravado at least hoping for a promotion wayward to delay g's promotion.
157,2,92,4Ke3,b'8/p7/8/3p1kPp/7P/1P2K3/P7/8 b - -',The advance continues...
158,2,93,4Ke5,b'8/p7/8/3pk1Pp/7P/1P2K3/P7/8 w - -',And this is as far as possible for my king to advance.
159,2,94,4a4,b'8/p7/8/3pk1Pp/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 b - a3',...Well then this just allows...
160,2,95,4a5,b'8/8/8/p2pk1Pp/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 w - a6',And even though I am down a pawn on the queenside I now own the board that way. White can dare to try moving the king to b4 but that allows me to secure the d pawn's promotion.
161,2,96,4g6,b'8/8/6P1/p2pk2p/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 b - -',And yet? Remember Qxg7 everyone? Here you have it. That move played such a long time ago hoping a centralized king wouldn't falter in place of a castled one? That costed me my own g7 pawn. If it were still there then this endgame would have been a much different finish now wouldn't it?
162,2,97,4Kf6,b'8/8/5kP1/p2p3p/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 w - -',Forced.
163,2,98,5g7,b'8/6P1/5k2/p2p3p/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 b - -',Not even necessary. Watch: (49. g6 Kf6 Kd4 Kxg6 Kxd5 Kf5...)
164,2,99,5Kxg7,b'8/6k1/8/p2p3p/P6P/1P2K3/8/8 w - -',Because either way Black has to place the king on g allowing this...
165,2,100,5Kd4,b'8/6k1/8/p2p3p/P2K3P/1P6/8/8 b - -',Now White wins the Queenside. But wait don't I now have the kingside?
166,2,101,5Kf6,b'8/8/5k2/p2p3p/P2K3P/1P6/8/8 w - -',I'm really hoping at this point since this is my only chance that I am not a move behind. OR if I am that I can balance tempo in the next moves.
167,2,102,5Kxd5,b'8/8/5k2/p2K3p/P6P/1P6/8/8 b - -',Here we go. Let's start counting.
168,2,103,5Kf5,b'8/8/8/p2K1k1p/P6P/1P6/8/8 w - -',Moves until h4 falls: 2
169,2,104,5Kc4,b'8/8/8/p4k1p/P1K4P/1P6/8/8 b - -',Moves until a5 falls: 2
170,2,105,5Kg4,b'8/8/8/p6p/P1K3kP/1P6/8/8 w - -',1

173,2,108,5Kxb4,b'8/8/8/7p/PK4kP/8/8/8 b - -',0.
174,2,109,5Kxh4,b'8/8/8/7p/PK5k/8/8/8 w - -',0. ...Well then I might be able to secure a Queen versus Queen endgame battle royale. Literally.
175,2,110,5a5,b'8/8/8/P6p/1K5k/8/8/8 b - -',Moves until a8=Q: 3.
176,2,111,5Kg3,b'8/8/8/P6p/1K6/6k1/8/8 w - -',Moves until h1=Q: 4 but if the king can make it to the pawn as it promotes...!
177,2,112,5a6,b'8/8/P7/7p/1K6/6k1/8/8 b - -',2.
178,2,113,5h4,b'8/8/P7/8/1K5p/6k1/8/8 w - -',3.
179,2,114,5a7,b'8/P7/8/8/1K5p/6k1/8/8 b - -',1.

Rxh7+ Kg8 22.Rg7+ Kh8 23. Kxe2 Qxc4+ 24. Kf2 Qxc2+ 25.Nxc2	when not only is White threatening the bishop but mate via Rag1-g3-h3. Now that the crisis is past Black has a clear edge because of the weak c pawn and White's King who is stuck in the middle.

281,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"White opens with a force using e4.  Bobby Fischer preferred this open.  He was an exceptional chess player as we all know.  Spassky liked d4 open and Spassky was as well a very professional player.  In my own mind I like e4 over d4 but I've used d4 after seeing my opponent might not have experience with it and that is the only time I use d4 white open: to upset the expected.  All have time to look into the history (past games) with an opponent and we should all take advantage of doing so.  I mean take the time to see what the opponent likes to do and why it is so.  

The Huntress has made in my own personalized mind the strongest open with e4 just like Bobby Fischer in the 1970s.  Since then this open has not been proven wrong and I respect the Huntress.  When I face e4 by white I choose Caro Kann mostly and sometimes Sicilian (SHEV) or Alekhine's.  I detest the Ruy Lopez defense along with the Giuccio Piano.  These black defenses can be torn apart very quickly especially if white (who opens e4) knows the King's Gambit.  "

All white has to do now is move pawn to f4 or bishop to c4 to kill black with a 1900's proven white attack.  It is called the King's Gambit either accepted or declined by black.  Either way black is in for it faster than expected.  See my own history here as 9422m against the Ruy Lopez.  The Gambit is not here to extend a game; rather it is here to win the game as soon as possible against the slow Ruy.  
283,7,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"Standard but first the f2 pawn should have been moved to f4 BEFORE THIS MOVE.  The King's Gambit pushes the king bishop pawn out to the line to be taken FOR POSITION.  This position is not at all in accordance to the King's Gambit.  White is just rolling along with the slow Ruy Lopez to wait and take advantage instead of finishing the game quickly with the King's Gambit.  
You chess players can look up the King's Gambit and see how many chapters are dedicated to it.  It shows how fast and how complex the open becomes to crush black in many different scenarios.  "

It is going to be a bout for many rounds before either is able to make a TKO or KO.  It is going to last longer than it should last.  My player hangatyr believes in boxing to the 15th round by using the Ruy Lopez.  I say why waste the time using a Ruy Lopez and if anyone uses a Ruy Lopez on me I just go King's Gambit to make the bouts fast and furious to end with blood all over the mat and a knock out in the end.

350,9,19,1Bb1,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/5n2/pPpNb3/2B5/P3P3/R4PPP/1bBQ1RK1 w - -',Dramatic. It seemed that black oversighted Rd2 but in fact this was exactly what he wanted.

355,9,24,1Be4,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/8/pPpNb3/2B1b3/P3P3/3BQPPP/5RK1 w - -',Dramatic but somewhat slow? Here it seems that everything is prepared for a black sac or some Qh4 like move...
356,9,25,Bg6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/6b1/pPp1b3/2B5/P1N1P3/3BQPPP/5RK1 w - -',Neither wants to lose the bishop pair... obviously. If black doesn't manage to break in the game will be decided in the endgame. White can't build an attack right now. Has few strong points and it is very hard to exploit them the right way. White succeeded let's see how. 
357,9,26,2Rd1,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/6b1/pPp1b3/2B5/P1N1P3/3BQPPP/3R2K1 b - -',Qh4 now is not a real threat anymore since the black's lsb is away from the white big diag. Black have to use the rooks to build something against the white king.

I think that black missed a chance here. Qh3 would almost force white to exchange queens with Qf1. White can't move the f pawn to block white's bishop on e4 without taking care of Bxg3 (it must have been a sac somewhere... :-). "
360,9,29,2Qd8,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/6b1/pPpNb3/2B5/P3P1P1/3BQP1P/3R2K1 w - -',If black wanted to weaken white's castling he should have looked what else to do. The Qf6 manouver has some sense if we think that by moving the knight white concedes again e4 to the black's lsb. This would be deadly if combined with Qh3 but white already knows she can defend from it (at the cost of queen's exchange).

378,9,47,Rg7,b'3rk3/6rp/1p3p2/pPpB1P2/P2bPB1P/5K2/8/1R6 w - -',Good for white. The g column was much more under control than the h one. Black can't penetrate right now unless he wants to exchange more material. The static pawn's formation helps white in keeping the balance even against the exchange. The bishop's pair proves to be very strong. Black has to sac the exchange (RxB and at least one pawn) in order to progress... being the c pawn the answer to black's game.

Operation Joblock snares another Master!  This time it is my mentor David Patron who had a rating just 40 points south of being an IM.  David is a very strong player and he certainly deserves to get to that level.  Again neither player did anything wrong except the fact that gameknot analysis did not like my last move and preferred h5 to Kg8.  So I achieve my fourth Master Draw!  But how did this block out occur?  Well we must all read on......"
546,15,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',1. ...... e5 - David tries me out with the English Opening by opening with 1. c4.  This opening can transpose into many other openings such as the Reti etc.
547,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',3. Nf3 - it does become a bit Reti-ish!

I decided to play this move to prevent Ng4 and to avoid that pawn becoming a target itself.
550,15,5,bxc3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/4p3/2P5/2P1PN2/P1QPBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',7. bxc3 - Hmm Qxc3 would have avoided doubling up his c pawns.  This doubleton will aid my bid to seal David out later on.

Now I really ought to block off that annoying b1-h7 diagonal and put a bit of a cramp in your position - at least for a while!  David: That's a good move Jo and the one I would have played for the reasons you have set out.  It irks me to have to withdraw my knight - for now at least.

I did agonise over which piece was the right one to defend it but I think it is good to at least put a rook on a half-open file.  I just hope I made the right choice here.  David said: I think Bf5 was very marginally the better move to support the battle for control of the centre.  But your choice was perfectly OK.  
554,15,9,1h3,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/8/2PPp3/2P1P2P/P1QNBPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',11. h3 - this move gives me the chance to play Bf5.  My weakie e4 pawn is now protected three times.

559,15,14,c5,b'r1q1r1k1/p4pp1/1p1p1nbp/n1p5/2PPp3/2P1P1NP/PBQ1BPP1/1R1R2K1 w - c6',16. ....... c5 - a multi-purpose move.  This move firmly seals off the queenside.  If dxc5 then dxc5 and I will have tidied up my backward pawn on the d column.
560,15,15,Qc7,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/1p1p1nbp/n1p5/2PPp3/B1P1P1NP/P1Q1BPP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',17. ...... Qc7 - Glenda acts as a foil to all the queenside pawns.  She also connects the rooks.

562,15,17,Kh8,b'3rr2k/p1q2pp1/1p1p1nbp/n1p5/Q1PPp3/B1P1P1NP/P2RBPP1/1R4K1 w - -',19. .... Kh8 - Dave said that all he could do was try and improve his position but he did not think he would get anywhere unless I over-extended myself.  Me shuttling Henry from h8 - g8 proved I had no intention of doing this.  After playing his rook to b5 Dave told me he would settle for a draw.  I put Henry back on g8 and made my offer of which Dave kindly accepted.  Interestingly enough Gameknot analysis stated that my last move was an inaccuracy.  So it turned out to be a very good draw offer in more ways than one.  For me it has been the tale of two buses.  After my epic draw with Freddy in 2010 I had to wait another three years for my third Draw which was against Skorpio now along comes the second bus - all in the space of two weeks.  In order to increase my tally of such scalps I need to be a little more consistent.  Anyhow David played very well and it was a good instructive game on how to defend properly.  I hope you all have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

976,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',E4 is my opponent's choice the perfect chance to try out what I've been practicing. My opponent was rated 2363 when we played. Most Grandmasters no longer play the Caro-Kann because it is deemed as rather dry and drawish - that is black in most lines gets easy development and good draw chances. However although sharp positions can arise the Caro-kann is not considered as 'fighting' as the Sicilian; in my games I've found this to be true - but if my opponent makes a mistake after the Caro-Kann opening and into the middle game black usually has a very good pawn structure and can take advantage of said mistake very easily. Stay tuned! ;)
977,25,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I respond with c6 the characteristic Caro-Kann 2nd move.
978,25,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',D4 by my opponent. All this is theory.
979,25,3,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a lesser played line favored by Anatoly Karpov at times. Taking with the queen in this position IS a safe 'uninspiring' response but it does something important: preserves the pawn structure black wishes to keep.
980,25,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',And the usual response is to chase the queen away with tempo. Some don't like taking with the queen because of that tempo but the loss of tempo here is not as much of an issue as it could be in the middle game or in a sharper opening.
981,25,5,Qd8,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And again this is the safest place for the queen right now. I don't favor Qa5 eventually having to move the queen a second time when tactics and strategic concerns are becoming a greater issue. Better to just move it back.
982,25,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',A typically aggressive place to position the Bishop although the d3 square for that bishop is considered in many lines to be better... nevertheless Fritz says this is the strongest move. F7 is often the weak point in the Caro-Kann and black must be aware of attacks against that point if choosing to play this system.
983,25,7,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Now in some lines Bg4 is much better. Black actually would like his knight on f5 in many lines of the Caro-Kann but getting the bishop to g4 requires some preparation. Had white tried Qf3 e6 would have followed. All kinds of things white can steer these lines into but black simply follows a few ideas and can be okay.
984,25,8,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Development. I could have chosen to move Nf6 first followed by Bg4; but I was wary of that light-squared bishop and needed my own bishop out so as to play e6 quickly.
985,25,9,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So before the rook comes to e1 I position the pawn on e6 which is a thematic place for it in the Caro-Kann. 
986,25,10,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/pp2bppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This is a good place for the bishop; it prevents tactics involving discovered check in a few moves protects against further piece aggression on the kingside. Now often in the Caro-Kann white castles queenside and throws those kingside pawns at black. He still can do that but if his attack fails his king will be vulnerable. EDITED: he can still throw his kingside pawns at me even having castled kingside was my intented meaning here; sorry for the vagueness of  my comment!
987,25,11,Qe2,b'rn1qk1nr/pp2bppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Getting ready to hit the e6 pawn. Ne5 was more accurate however! It will take a few moves for white to be ready and my king will not remain there long enough. So I continue developing. The purpose of the Caro-Kann is to in most lines develop fully before trying to make inroads against the space advantage white WILL have. It is a lot like a French defense and in some lines very similar; but of course there is not the problem of the bishop... or at least not to that extent. So far most of the play has not been the more dangerous lines for black. So far! if you want to see a dangerous line for black watch that 2nd Anand/Carlsen game up to the QxQ move and imagine instead Vishy going for Qg4. Unpleasant!
988,25,12,Nd7,b'r2qk1nr/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',This is a very important move in the Caro-Kann. it is to prevent a white knight from remaining at the e5 outpost where it can greatly pressure f7 as white mounts an attack.
989,25,13,Ngf6,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',And now my development is almost complete. Notice that white has a space advantage his pieces are fairly coordinated but there is not yet great pressure on black's king. 
990,25,14,1Nfg5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',This is the first inaccurate move. Not a blunder but it really does little for white's attack here despite the scary look of the board! ;)
991,25,15,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Am I castling into it? Fritz says the game is now equalized.
992,25,16,1c3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Shoring up the white pawn structure... and I believe sitting there trying to provoke h6. My opponent here is making a high percentage of very good moves. 
993,25,17,1Nxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5bN1/2BPn3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Well let's see which piece he takes with...
994,25,18,1Nxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I thought as much. This guy remember is rated over 2350. One of the strongest players I've ever played. But I am not experimenting this game; yes I am trying out some of what I've been studying but focusing in this one; trying my best to win. Fritz says the game is equal here but white has a tiny edge still.
995,25,19,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Now white has made a few inaccuracies; take note of them: ideally he'd like a knight on e5 and should be advancing the h pawn and often other kingside pawns. Perhaps he is not as familiar with the theory; as a result so far my defense is solid. Notice that although I don't like my light-squared bishop where it is at I haven't repositioned it yet because I haven't needed to yet. All my pieces are where they need to be except that one but where it needs to be I am not certain of yet. Oh! And the queen of course. C7 is a typical spot for the queen in the Caro-Kann but at this point I have a plan and don't feel like moving the queen twice...
996,25,20,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2BPN3/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This made me pause a moment. White has just loosened up the king safety but for what advantage? I can't tell if he plans on trying g4 here; but if so he'd have been better to have his king on the queenside. This move is not really an inaccuracy by my opponent but in this position this plan seems slow if it's to support g4. Now Fritz wants me to counter with b5 and Nd5 but I want to move my bishop first. I don't want white getting his pawns rolling with tempo if that is his intent.
997,25,21,1Bg6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pnb1/8/2BPN3/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I retreat it. I still can advance my own h pawn to hide the bishop but I don't want to have to be solely passive... and it's not time yet to trade for that knight. Note that if black in the Caro-kann trades his light-squared bishop for a knight then black should blockade on the white squares and play on the dark squares. THIS is important in the Caro-kann. Also note that if I do move g6 I will likely be inviting a piece (bishop) sacrifice on h6 and could find myself on the defensive - and passive - for a while.
998,25,22,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pnb1/8/2BPNB2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',White controls the C7 spot but I'm not going to need it anyways. I could contest the square but I don't want to trade bishops. Otherwise not sure where white is going here; he may be thinking of putting his bishop on e5. Simply amazing to see how many first picks my opponent is moving here! He's good. Many of mine aren't first picks but they're all based on Caro-Kann principles and so far they haven't let me down.
999,25,23,1Nxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p1b1/8/2BPnB2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I decide to take the knight after all. Fritz does not like this at all giving .4 more to white's score. This gives white a better pawn center with a (imho more dangerous) half open file so this move was probably not the best one by me. But I did it because I am still back on my heels and I need to: 1. Reduce the pressure a bit and 2. Create a little opportunity for activity. I most especially did NOT want that knight getting to c5 and it's a potential defender of what I wish to do next... while my knight would be too far away to help!
1000,25,24,b5,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p1p1b1/1p6/2BPPB2/2P5/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - b6',In the Caro-Kann if white allows black to get developed and allows black a smidgeon of initiative hitting back on the queenside with b5 is a good way to get counter play. Fritz wanted me to do this a couple of moves ago but I wasn't ready. My opponent probably expected this. A c5 pawn break in some positions is even better for black.
1001,25,25,1Bb3,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p1p1b1/1p6/3PPB2/1BP5/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Bb3 again the best response. Sheesh. This guy must have an engine in his head! Look at the position; white is still dominating the board. But this is a tiny crack and I try to make use of it.
1002,25,26,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/2p1p1b1/pp6/3PPB2/1BP5/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - a6',And now I am pushing back.
1003,25,27,1Rae1,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/2p1p1b1/pp6/3PPB2/1BP5/PP2Q1PP/4RRK1 b - -',Amazingly white dismisses my queenside pawn push and positions for his own attack. Well and good as perhaps he thinks to win my dark-squared bishop. But Fritz says my opponent has just made his second inaccurate move; Rad1 was better. Perhaps he thought I would play c5 which is also one of the thematic moves in the Caro-Kann and perhaps his plan was d5 in response beginning his king assault. I am mindful of that hence I have not gone for the c5 break to this point move 17. Note that my c pawn is backwards but there is no simple way for white to take advantage of that and it's often necessary to live with that when creating counterplay on the queenside - at least for a bit.
1004,25,28,1Bc2,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/2p1p1b1/1p6/p2PPB2/2P5/PPB1Q1PP/4RRK1 b - -',This is probably the best square for white's light squared bishop but it potentially allows me the chance at an opportune time to get my own inactive (up to this point despite the great diagonal) bishop off the board.
1005,25,29,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/2p1p1b1/8/pp1PPB2/2P5/PPB1Q1PP/4RRK1 w - -',Now this could disrupt the e1 rook if cxb4 with white not wishing to trade dark-squared bishops. Or perhaps he doesn't want to have to move the black bishop if I were to retake the pawn exchange with my bishop threatening his rook on e1. Or so it seems that he just wants his rook to remain where it is even though Fritz still says it belongs on d1.
1006,25,30,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/2p1p1b1/8/pp1PPB2/2P4P/PPB1Q1P1/4RRK1 b - -',Instead white creates a place to put his king... if so I am not impressed by this prophylactic move as right now I think it is not necessary. Plus it allows me to reposition for my queenside push before white's attack gets rolling. A miscue by my opponent and Fritz dislikes it too.
1007,25,31,1Qb6,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/pp1PPB2/2P4P/PPB1Q1P1/4RRK1 w - -',White does not like my queen ex-raying his king and decides to do something about that. Here I missed a3 which ought to win something akin to a pawn or come close to it: 19...a3 20. Bb3 c5 21. d5 axb2 22. Qxb2 exd5 23. Bxd5 Bf6 and the c pawn falls to name one possibility with a very good position for black.
1008,25,32,2Kh1,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/pp1PPB2/2P4P/PPB1Q1P1/4RR1K b - -',This move will come back to haunt white. But where else could he go? I have counter play now and although I am still cramped this is all this opening is supposed to get me. Not as fighting as the Sicilian but it's VERY simple to learn and as we recently saw still in the top grandmaster's repertoire. And yes I need simple!
1009,25,33,2b3,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/p2PPB2/1pP4P/PPB1Q1P1/4RR1K w - -',This shouldn't go anywhere really; but because white wishes to keep his bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal it does. Because white chooses b1 rather than d3.
1010,25,34,2Bb1,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/p2PPB2/1pP4P/PP2Q1P1/1B2RR1K b - -',What would you do here as white? Axb3 was slightly better. What would you do here as black?
1011,25,35,2a3,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/3PPB2/ppP4P/PP2Q1P1/1B2RR1K w - -',...a3! There is no overwhelming advantage to be had; but now every white continuation is favorable to black. I am giving white problems up there. Potentially able to double rooks on the a file with a pawn going that way my pieces all pointing that way now white realizes he has to give some consideration to what I've been doing up there!
1012,25,36,2Rf2,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/3PPB2/ppP4P/PP2QRP1/1B2R2K b - -',So he doubles on the 2nd rank and is also positioning to double on the f file! However I find a great in-between move in this Blitz game that Fritz does not even consider:
1013,25,37,2Bh4,b'r4rk1/5ppp/1qp1p1b1/8/3PPB1b/ppP4P/PP2QRP1/1B2R2K w - -',Bh4! Fritz thinks this is a mistake. But! Every white continuation is still negative; and white is forced to move his g pawn or lose material. Most important of all... this move further weakens his king...
1014,25,38,2g3,b'r4rk1/5ppp/1qp1p1b1/8/3PPB1b/ppP3PP/PP2QR2/1B2R2K b - -',Back to where I was. Did I lose a tempo? Yes but I judged the compensation worth it. White must still deal with the queenside and his king safety as I mentioned  is much looser.
1015,25,39,2Qc4,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/2QPPB2/ppP3PP/PP3R2/1B2R2K b - -',White probably would not have done this if he had more time to consider. Fritz doesn't like this move either. But then again he is a strong player; he's choosing double-edged positions. His d5 push could come... but not much will yet come of it because of the position. So he has yet to push that d pawn and here we are on our 24th move. The evaluation favors black now by nearly a pawn!
1016,25,40,2bxa2,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/2QPPB2/p1P3PP/pP3R2/1B2R2K w - -',At this key point of the game I make the best choice. The top four Fritz choices are -.83 -1.70 -11.47 and -12.02 How should white recapture?
1017,25,41,2Bxa2,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/2QPPB2/p1P3PP/BP3R2/4R2K b - -',He chooses the bishop. Not the best choice the queen as the better choice because it allows what happens now.
1018,25,42,2Rb1,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p1b1/8/2QPPB2/2P3PP/Bp3R2/1R5K b - -',Finally my opponent is the one who blunders. Black is solidly winning now -+(-5 and change). Before this the best evaluation for white was still favoring black but not nearly by as much: -+ 2.15 with Rfe2; and Bb1 and Rff1 and Kg1 were possible although slightly less accurate.
1019,25,43,2Bxe4+,b'r4rk1/4bppp/1qp1p3/8/2QPbB2/2P3PP/Bp3R2/1R5K w - -',Here my opponent resigned. A good example of creating counter play in the Caro-Kann that even without that white rook move had black increasing the advantage. This has probably been my best 'Blitz' play for accuracy and opening principle both. Now as an aside look at the pawn structure. Although often black has a pawn on h6 white's pawn structure is to be blunt rather destroyed. In an endgame I believe black would have had the advantage and that is what I try to play for. If you want something far simpler to play with than the Sicilian with good drawing and some winning chances this is not a bad opening to try. Hope you enjoyed this one feel free to critique.

Considerando solo i Campioni del Mondo “classici”.  Carlsen ha conquistato il titolo a 8 giorni di distanza dal suo 23° compleanno con cinque mesi (per la precisione 147 giorni) di ritardo rispetto a Kasparov (Campione a 22 anni e 210 giorni). Se consideriamo anche l’infelice stagione dei Mondiali KO FIDE il record di precocità spetta invece a Ponomariov (18 anni e 106 giorni) record che molto probabilmente resterà imbattuto ancora a lungo.
 Dopo aver respinto gli assalti di Kramnik Topalov e Gelfand alla quarta difesa ‘Vishy’ cede dunque la Corona allo ‘yankee’ che viene dalla Norvegia. Carlsen ha spazzato via senza particolari difficoltà le presunte insidie che molti pensavano avrebbe dovuto affrontare nel suo primo match facendo invece pesare tutti i suoi 95 punti Elo in più.
Secondo molti oggi inizia di una “Nuova Era” fatta di “giocatori al silicio” quasi privi di anima e di passione per il bel gioco ma “acrobaticamente” freddi e precisi. Noi la pensiamo diversamente. “Mozart” e “Macchina” degli scacchi sono appellativi già attribuiti quasi  100 anni fa ad un altro Campione del Mondo Jose Raul Capablanca anche lui osannato per il suo gioco preciso naturale e senza rischi anche lui criticato per gli stessi identici motivi! Non molto di nuovo sembra dunque scorrere sulle 64 caselle …
Passando al Campione detronizzato dopo un inizio che aveva lasciato ben sperare (sull’incertezza del match) Anand è stato surclassato da Carlsen che oltre a vincere tre partite ha sempre dato l’impressione di essere in pieno controllo della situazione. Questo risultato deludente per chi si aspettava un match più equilibrato non può però incrinare la figura del Quindicesimo Campione del Mondo che è bene ricordarlo è stato tale per oltre 6 anni!
Prima di concludere rivolgiamo una “preghiera” al Nuovo Campione del Mondo perché non privi gli appassionati dell‘ultra-centenaria tradizione dei Match Mondiali. In passato Carlsen ha dichiarato di preferire un Torneo al Match che a suo avviso concede troppi privilegi al Campione in carica. La speranza è che il norvegese cambi idea e perciò  lo abbiamo “consacrato” XVI Campione del Mondo perché senta la responsabilità di portare una Corona che è stata di Steinitz Lasker Capablanca Alechine Euwe Botvinnik Smyslov Tal Petrosjan Spassky Fischer Karpov Kasparov Kramnik e Anand. In cambio vi garantiamo sin d’ora che non lo criticheremo per aver cambiato idea!

Il Numero Uno al Mondo si avvicina così in sole 28 mosse a mezzo punto (da ottenere in tre partite!) dal naturale congiungimento con la Corona Mondiale!
L’andamento di questa partita ci spiega forse il perché del comportamento di Anand nei due precedenti incontri. Probabilmente e i fatti gli hanno dato ragione l’indiano non si sentiva in grado di affrontare “Carlsen-Houdini” in una battaglia tattica.  In conferenza stampa si è poi visto un Anand inaspettatamente (visto il grave errore) rilassato quasi che il Campione del Mondo si sia sentito finalmente liberato dal dovere di provare a difendere un Titolo ormai divenuto troppo “pesante”.

Bg5 however this gives White plenty of options. I want that bishop out of play and to provide relief to this diagonal; the question is when do I play Bd3?
1504,37,12,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p3bp/8/3P3P/5NN1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Out comes this knight having a certain idea in mind.
1505,37,13,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2nbp/8/3P3P/5NN1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Development and making O-O a nearer possibility.
1506,37,14,Ne5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2nbp/4N3/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue to target the bishop; meanwhile this is an excellant square for the knight so why not?
1507,37,15,Bh7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppb/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Forced into a corner. All other squares are terrible moves.
1508,37,16,Bd3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppb/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',And now Black must lose this powerful bishop or forever hide it from play...
1509,37,17,Bxd3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3P/3b2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Likewise. Is Bg8 even worth considering?
1510,37,18,1Qxd3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',No point in doubling the pawns; the knight is currently safe on e5 and this is a great square for the queen. My king is also able to castle long soon...
1511,37,19,1e6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black wants to harass with the other bishop now forcing c3 after Bb4+ if I'm not careful.
1512,37,20,1Bd2,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPPB1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Not happening. White's development is almost complete now and I'm ready to castle whichever direction I need to go for almost any attacking plan. But as for Black...
1513,37,21,1Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPPB1PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',A good choice. The knight on e5 is very well placed at the moment and Black wants it gone before it starts threatening anything of value. So why didn't the bishop come out instead...?
1514,37,22,1f4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/4N3/3P1P1P/3Q2N1/PPPB2P1/R3K2R b KQkq f3',Most likely because this was going to be played next anyway. I have no intentions of castling short so I may as well continue in storming up the kingside in the meantime.
1515,37,23,1Nxe5,b'r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/4n3/3P1P1P/3Q2N1/PPPB2P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',But Black absolutely wants that knight gone.
1516,37,24,1fxe5,b'r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/4P3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPPB2P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',A powerful knight swapped in for a powerful pawn. I'm perfectly fine with this as this puts a lot of delicate pressure on the f file and as we'll later see Black never quite gets strong enough in this match to finally play ...f6 so this pawn actually becomes one of the key deciding factors in the outcome of this match. It certainly did a great job this game of harassing these pesky knights...
1517,37,25,1Nd5,b'r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3nP3/3P3P/3Q2N1/PPPB2P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',At first I was surprised by this move. I was expecting to see ...Ng4 because if I were to play say O-O-O?? then Black immediately follows with Nf2! thusly forking the rook and queen. However I didn't notice that the following sequence: Ng4 Qf3 h5 Nxh5 Rxh5 Qxg4 put me up a pawn to a rook that must move to somewhere awkward and forces the king to retreat to an open kingside. As for Nd5...
1518,37,26,1a3,b'r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3nP3/3P3P/P2Q2N1/1PPB2P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Black really wants to disrupt the queenside by tempting c4 instead and the knight move challenges my ability to fight for the b4 square if I don't do something about it. So instead of chasing the knight away I play this preventing any hopes of a back rank piece hitting that square.
1519,37,27,1Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/3nP3/3P3P/P2Q2N1/1PPB2P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',I'm not in the clear yet though. Black has now enabled castling and h4 is under attack regardless if the pawn is there or not! 
1520,37,28,1Nh5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/3nP2N/3P3P/P2Q4/1PPB2P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',The only move I have that preserves my ability to castle without a material loss. g3 can now be played against Bxh4+ and after the bishop would be chased away I play Nxg7+! forcing the black king to move after opening the kingside up even further.
1521,37,29,1g6,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2p1p1pp/3nP2N/3P3P/P2Q4/1PPB2P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',So Black decides to confuse matters by pushing out this pawn here.
1522,37,30,1Nf4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2p1p1pp/3nP3/3P1N1P/P2Q4/1PPB2P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Ng7+ blunders now after Kf8 and if Nf6 then Nxf6 first and I have to lose the powerful central pawns that I worked so hard to establish. This was far more preferable.
1523,37,31,1Nxf4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2p1p1pp/4P3/3P1n1P/P2Q4/1PPB2P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black seems to hate the thought of knights being on the board.
1524,37,32,1Bxf4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2p1p1pp/4P3/3P1B1P/P2Q4/1PP3P1/R3K2R b KQkq -',So I remove the last one. Interestingly enough as open as this game WAS earlier at one point the falling of this knight chimes the bells to ring for a closed match to begin. Within 10 moves due to this capture the board ends up being quite tangled and unclear for quite some time.
1525,37,33,1Bf8,b'r2qkb1r/pp3p2/2p1p1pp/4P3/3P1B1P/P2Q4/1PP3P1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black could have castled first but saw that there were no good squares for this bishop on the smaller diagonal. So they decide to re-adjust their side of the board at once.
1526,37,34,1O-O-O,b'r2qkb1r/pp3p2/2p1p1pp/4P3/3P1B1P/P2Q4/1PP3P1/2KR3R b kq -',I finally take this as a great opportunity to castle.
1527,37,35,1Qb6,b'r3kb1r/pp3p2/1qp1p1pp/4P3/3P1B1P/P2Q4/1PP3P1/2KR3R w kq -',Left with nothing much better to do Black gives the board one last once-over with a good square for the queen here. If there is going to be disruption of b4 and my queen pawns it has to be now.
1528,37,36,1c4,b'r3kb1r/pp3p2/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P4P1/2KR3R b kq c3',As for me... I remember giving this board one very hard long look. I think this move took me a couple of days to conclude this as the best option for my plan. I guess I must have been very concerned about the potential of Black advancing the pawn all the way to c4 after harrassing my other pawns and if c3 then I have wasted a move if Black wants to eventually attack the a file (since my queen is the only defender if the b pawn can be diverted away!) though I'm sure I was concerned over other things at the time.
1529,37,37,1Bg7,b'r3k2r/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P4P1/2KR3R w kq -',I say the former of the last move because I remember being very surprised by this move. If Black is trying to target b2 with this bishop it's going to be some time before its influence arrives there...
1530,37,38,2Rhe1,b'r3k2r/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P4P1/2KRR3 b kq -',This probably wasn't necessary... but it was there in case e5 needed an extra defender.
1531,37,39,2O-O,b'r4rk1/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P4P1/2KRR3 w - -',Now that Black has finally done this however the board becomes a little more complicated. Notice how the key files to watch out for are especially d and e with the desire of White winning f and Black winning b. With this in mind I saw that I really needed to constantly stay ready and on guard for f6 R?d8 and any queen move made by Black.
1532,37,40,2Rd2,b'r4rk1/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P1R2P1/2K1R3 b - -',And this was the only way I saw how to guard all threats at once.
1533,37,41,2Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P1R2P1/2K1R3 w - -',d4 is under some stress now but I am fully ready to protect it.
1534,37,42,2Red1,b'3r1rk1/pp3pb1/1qp1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P1R2P1/2KR4 b - -',Now I'm in a position where Black's intentions will be indicated by any piece that moves next. As far as the central pawns are concerned if it is clear that d4 is being targeted both rooks will stay here. If e5 is targetted one of them must move back.
1535,37,43,2Qa6,b'3r1rk1/pp3pb1/q1p1p1pp/4P3/2PP1B1P/P2Q4/1P1R2P1/2KR4 w - -',Black cannot play f6 otherwise Qxg6 and the bishop is pinned to a nightmare of messes. So they move the queen allowing for a pawn storm. What they want me to do is try to force an exchange of pawns opening the board up to my king for the rooks and queen to take him.
1536,37,44,2b4,b'3r1rk1/pp3pb1/q1p1p1pp/4P3/1PPP1B1P/P2Q4/3R2P1/2KR4 b - b3',I decide to counter with a pawn storm of my own preventing any possible play of ...b4! by Black AND while allowing the queen or even a rook to continue guarding a3 from the 3rd rank as ignoring this problem would surely prove utterly fatal for me.
1537,37,45,2b5,b'3r1rk1/p4pb1/q1p1p1pp/1p2P3/1PPP1B1P/P2Q4/3R2P1/2KR4 w - b6',Yet Black still dares me to exchange. 
1538,37,46,2c5,b'3r1rk1/p4pb1/q1p1p1pp/1pP1P3/1P1P1B1P/P2Q4/3R2P1/2KR4 b - -',Yeah... no. With that move the position is now closed with White holding and maintaining a clear spacial advantage. The battle for center control is far from over though.
1539,37,47,2Qb7,b'3r1rk1/pq3pb1/2p1p1pp/1pP1P3/1P1P1B1P/P2Q4/3R2P1/2KR4 w - -',Allowing the queen to be able to pressure d4 and enables ...a5! White now has some serious defense issues and I have to find some way to have these spaced defenses to work in my favor.
1540,37,48,2Rb2,b'3r1rk1/pq3pb1/2p1p1pp/1pP1P3/1P1P1B1P/P2Q4/1R4P1/2KR4 b - -',If a5 is played b4 is now a threatened square. It must be defended right now with the rook able to return to defending d4 from d2 if necessary.
1541,37,49,2Rd5,b'5rk1/pq3pb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1B1P/P2Q4/1R4P1/2KR4 w - -',(?) - In my opinion probably the first mistake of the match although it maintains a threat on both d4 and e5. However in doing this should Black need to retreat this rook at all during the match there is only one direction where it can move to where it is needed....
1542,37,50,2Qe3,b'5rk1/pq3pb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1B1P/P3Q3/1R4P1/2KR4 b - -',A wonderful square for the queen in this tangled web! She now protects both threatened pawns and now threatens opening the king to Bxh6!
1543,37,51,2Kh7,b'5r2/pq3pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1B1P/P3Q3/1R4P1/2KR4 w - -',The king must not allow this to happen.
1544,37,52,2g4,b'5r2/pq3pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P3Q3/1R6/2KR4 b - g3',This move may have been premature. Its intention was to freeze the kingside in place effectively making all pawn moves by Black at this point too dangerous to even consider...
1545,37,53,2Rfd8,b'3r4/pq3pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P3Q3/1R6/2KR4 w - -',...but now I have one final problem. d4 is under attack and the 2nd rank rook is unavailable. I am totally out of defenders to fix this problem-
1546,37,54,2Kc2,b'3r4/pq3pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P3Q3/1RK5/3R4 b - -',-no wait I am NOT! For I am the White King and I will NOT stand idlely by while so many players forget that I am an actual piece and can contribute to this match! 
1547,37,55,2Qd7,b'3r4/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P3Q3/1RK5/3R4 w - -',I imagine that Black must have figured that I sealed my fate of guarding d4 at this point now that the king completely blocks R2d2 to join the battle. However!
1548,37,56,2Kc3,b'3r4/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P1K1Q3/1R6/3R4 b - -',...they must not have seen this saving grace from entering the fray like this...!
1549,37,57,2Ra8,b'r7/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/P1K1Q3/1R6/3R4 w - -',It is now very clear that the fate of Black's A pawn will determine the outcome of this match.
1550,37,58,3Rb3,b'r7/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/PRK1Q3/8/3R4 b - -',So I prepare to defend a3 along with b4 at all costs.
1551,37,59,3Rd8,b'3r4/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P1BPP/PRK1Q3/8/3R4 w - -',And... now the game becomes tricky. If I do not find some other ground to advance upon Black can force a draw unless I can convince them that my spacial advantage is disputable.
1552,37,60,3Bg3,b'3r4/p2q1pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P2PP/PRK1Q1B1/8/3R4 b - -',This means the queen must find a new square. No longer fearing f6 I believe I was planning a later Bf2 allowing the queen possible options to advance upon the enemy king.
1553,37,61,3Qc7,b'3r4/p1q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P2PP/PRK1Q1B1/8/3R4 w - -',And then out of nowhere this move appears. Is Black going to try aiming for e5 anyway...?
1554,37,62,3Rb2,b'3r4/p1q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/1P1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/1R6/3R4 b - -',I cannot lose e5 so I allow the rook to be a possible defender all around once again.
1555,37,63,3a5,b'3r4/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/ppPrP3/1P1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/1R6/3R4 w - a6',-and too soon I think. I'm not in zugzwang at all just yet. Surely Black has better moves! Besides I have plenty of options now that this move has appeared so suddenly.
1556,37,64,3Rb3,b'3r4/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/ppPrP3/1P1P2PP/PRK1Q1B1/8/3R4 b - -',Dare I dream to hope that Black will play greedy instead of taking the pawn...?
1557,37,65,3a4,b'3r4/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/PRK1Q1B1/8/3R4 w - -',And there you have it! My trap has sprung; Black has ruined all chances of wrecking my queenside as has been desired all along. Now the game will be decided on the kingside- their weaker domain.
1558,37,66,3Rb2,b'3r4/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/1R6/3R4 b - -',d4 now has three defenders out of a possible five and it is only being attacked twice. My rook is no longer needed here as I continue celebrating its freedom.
1559,37,67,3Qe7,b'3r4/4qpbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/1R6/3R4 w - -',And I'm not too sure about the intentions of this move either but I think it was to allow ...g5 to be a stronger move by Black. The motives seem a bit unclear to me.
1560,37,68,3Rf2,b'3r4/4qpbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/5R2/3R4 b - -',Now I play an attacking role screaming down my control of f.
1561,37,69,3Rf8,b'5r2/4qpbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/5R2/3R4 w - -',Black cannot allow f7's seizure. Its pressure must be let off of the d file for now.
1562,37,70,3Rdf1,b'5r2/4qpbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/5R2/5R2 b - -',-which now allows the other rook off the d file further strengthing my control of the weaker column.
1563,37,71,3Kg8,b'5rk1/4qpb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1Q1B1/5R2/5R2 w - -',But now I have a dilemma! Black decides to employ my previous tactic of actually using the king as a defending piece. The problem is... it works! The nature of this closed position as the board stands Black can have just as many defenders as I can have attackers on the f7 pawn! I need a new plan!
1564,37,72,3Rf2f3,b'5rk1/4qpb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1QRB1/8/5R2 b - -',I need to start untangling this web. Perhaps the order of which pieces stack where (Queen at bottom) can help me sort this out?

1568,37,76,3Qd2,b'5r2/1q3pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1K2R2/3Q4/5R2 b - -',What if I can pull the bishop back?
1569,37,77,3Qc7,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1K2R2/3Q4/5R2 w - -',Well... then Black shall attack e5 if I don't immediately fix this problem.
1570,37,78,4Qc2,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1K2R2/2Q5/5R2 b - -',Seeing the weakness on g6 I plan h5! in order to open up the path to the king.

1577,37,85,4Qa7,b'5rk1/q4pb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1KQ1R2/5R2/8 w - -',Black is clearly waiting for me to decide on a new strategy but stronger is Qe7. With the bishop oddly misplaced I don't have a way of preventing Qxh4 without retreating.
1578,37,86,4Qf1,b'5rk1/q4pb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1K2R2/5R2/5Q2 b - -',-But should that be Black's plan I'll be ready to launch a full assault on f7; I finally sat myself down and saw a working plan to blast open the kingside! Now my attack is ready for action. Meanwhile though I'm pretty sure that given the next set of moves Black had other thoughts in their mind...
1579,37,87,4Qb7,b'5rk1/1q3pb1/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P1BPP/P1K2R2/5R2/5Q2 w - -',(Just give up and accept my draw offer!)

1583,37,91,4Qc7,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP3/pP1P2PP/P1K1BR2/5R2/2Q5 w - -',(Ha! It's almost as though White thinks they can break my defenses! Just go ahead and try!)
1584,37,92,4h5,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p1pp/1pPrP2P/pP1P2P1/P1K1BR2/5R2/2Q5 b - -',(Wait... what? Do they not obviously see that I do not have to accept this exchange?!)
1585,37,93,4g5,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p2p/1pPrP1pP/pP1P2P1/P1K1BR2/5R2/2Q5 w - -',(MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Your game is over!)
1586,37,94,4Bxg5,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p2p/1pPrP1BP/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/2Q5 b - -',-Not so fast my dear friend! Now that the queen does not occupy e7 THIS can be played! Those pesky pawns are worth so much more than the bishop at this point... and the king is now exposed to the wind!
1587,37,95,4hxg5,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p3/1pPrP1pP/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/2Q5 w - -',Rd7 here (incidentally should have been played a LONG time ago) might have been better although I did have g6+ as an alternative.
1588,37,96,4Qxg5,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p3/1pPrP1QP/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 b - -',Well hello there Black! Nice to see you this up close and personal!
1589,37,97,4Bh6,b'5r2/2q2p1k/2p1p2b/1pPrP1QP/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 w - -',What few squares this bishop still has are good ones for it however...
1590,37,98,5Qf6,b'5r2/2q2p1k/2p1pQ1b/1pPrP2P/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 b - -',It cannot save the king. There are too many squares I can threaten at this point.
1591,37,99,5Bg7,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1pQ2/1pPrP2P/pP1P2P1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 w - -',Black drives the queen off of the 6th rank anyway.
1592,37,100,5Qf4,b'5r2/2q2pbk/2p1p3/1pPrP2P/pP1P1QP1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 b - -',It doesn't matter. A kingside pawn storm will prove this match to be mine.
1593,37,101,5Qe7,b'5r2/4qpbk/2p1p3/1pPrP2P/pP1P1QP1/P1K2R2/5R2/8 w - -',Futile.
1594,37,102,5g5,b'5r2/4qpbk/2p1p3/1pPrP1PP/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/5R2/8 b - -',That f pawn is going to fall any moment now. The king must move or meet its fate to my rooks if it dares allow itself to be checked.
1595,37,103,5Kg8,b'5rk1/4qpb1/2p1p3/1pPrP1PP/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/5R2/8 w - -',It doesn't so now I can play...
1596,37,104,5h6,b'5rk1/4qpb1/2p1p2P/1pPrP1P1/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/5R2/8 b - -',Back into your corner!
1597,37,105,5Bh8,b'5rkb/4qp2/2p1p2P/1pPrP1P1/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/5R2/8 w - -',And yet it remains to be a good if not utterly confined square for this piece.
1598,37,106,5Rg2,b'5rkb/4qp2/2p1p2P/1pPrP1P1/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/6R1/8 b - -',So to be doubly sure of things I play this removing all hopes of the capture of either pawn.
1599,37,107,5Rd7,b'5rkb/3rqp2/2p1p2P/1pP1P1P1/pP1P1Q2/P1K2R2/6R1/8 w - -',And finally Black plays this move in a desperate attempt to spare f7.
1600,37,108,5Rh3,b'5rkb/3rqp2/2p1p2P/1pP1P1P1/pP1P1Q2/P1K4R/6R1/8 b - -',Unfortunately I no longer need that attack. Now h7+ is viable.
1601,37,109,5f5,b'5rkb/3rq3/2p1p2P/1pP1PpP1/pP1P1Q2/P1K4R/6R1/8 w - f6',A desperate move to give the king a flight square or else I'd have mate.
1602,37,110,5gxf6e.p.+,b'5rkb/3rq3/2p1pP1P/1pP1P3/pP1P1Q2/P1K4R/6R1/8 b - -',And there you have it. If I'm not wrong Black's king can actually escape mate via Kf7 and then run off to e8 but the queen would be lost in the process of doing so. In face of such dire circumstances Black resigns here thus resolving this greatly satisfying battle of such a contested center. This was easily one of the most fun and puzzling matches I've had in some time; thank you for reading this annotation! :)
1603,38,0,bxc6,b'r2qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/2pp1b2/8/1P2PN1P/PBPP1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',I thought that here white would have played Ne5 attacking the c pawn. Not a very good plan since the white queen can't reinforce the attack easily via a4. 
1604,38,1,Bxf6,b'r2qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2B2/2pp1b2/8/1P2PN1P/P1PP1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Kind of weird move. White seems to give up his pieces. 
1605,38,2,Bg6,b'r2qkb1r/p3pp1p/2p2pb1/2pp4/7N/1P2P2P/P1PP1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',It was tempting to retire the bishop and keep the pair but maybe wisely black preferred to even the game right now and take advantage of his central phalanx and the semi open column. 
1606,38,3,e6,b'r2qkb1r/p4p1p/2p1ppb1/2pp4/7N/1P2P2P/P1PP1PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',...or Rg8 at once. Black wisely (IMO) leaves the black diagonal open for the pieces instead of allowing tempoes to white going e4 (if ever allowed).
1607,38,4,1c3,b'r2qk2r/p4p1p/2pbppb1/2pp4/7N/1PPPP2P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White can't find an armonious way to develop. 
1608,38,5,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/p1q2p1p/2pbppb1/2pp4/7N/1PPPP2P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',well black gives away the tempo won after f5 against the knight but opens the way for castling and white is far from reorganizing. 
1609,38,6,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/p1q2p1p/2pbppb1/2pp4/8/1PPPPN1P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Na3 is impossible due to Qa5. White would have to play Qc1 leaving c3 unattended if the knight goes to c2. A hell of a bind. 
1610,38,7,Rhg8,b'r5r1/p1q1kp1p/2pbppb1/2pp4/3P4/1PP1PN1P/P4PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Right! Just ignore him!
1611,38,8,Rg7,b'r7/p1q1kprp/2pbppb1/2pp4/3P4/1PP1PN1P/P2N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Nothing comes from Bd3 even if evil-looking...
1612,38,9,Qd7,b'6r1/p2qkpr1/2pbpp2/2pp3p/3Pb2P/1PP1P3/P2N1PP1/R2QN1RK w - -',It would be interesting to know the plan behind this move. 
1613,38,10,e5,b'6r1/p2qkpr1/2pb1p2/2ppp2p/3Pb2P/1PP1PP2/P2N2P1/R2QN1RK w - -',Wow! This is a nice sac indeed!
1614,38,11,Qh3+,b'6r1/p3kpr1/2pb1p2/2ppp2p/3PP2P/1PP1P2q/P2N2P1/R2QN1RK w - -',Wonderful. A fantastic view.

1616,39,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Indian Defence!
1617,39,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I play my usual
1618,39,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He goes for a King's Indian
1619,39,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I do main line
1620,39,4,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He goes for a pure King's Indian as opposed to the Grunfeld 3....d5
1621,39,5,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',I take the centre
1622,39,6,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He stops e5
1623,39,7,f3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I play my usual Samisch variation
1624,39,8,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',He castles
1625,39,9,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',I continue with main line
1626,39,10,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ c6',This is a good pawn sacrifice it is very dangerous for white to accept
1627,39,11,Nge2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',So I played this instead

1629,39,13,Nxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',So I take back
1630,39,14,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',He develops
