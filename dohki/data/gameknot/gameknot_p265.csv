0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I went on a kick where I tried opening 1. c4 for awhile and that was a disaster.  Back to 1. e4 to me for awhile!
1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian.  A lot of people here play the Sicilian or respond 1. ...e5.  And a number of people who prefer queen's pawn games play 1. ...d5.  Why don't people play the Caro-Kann Pirc or French here much?
2,0,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',d4 is a funny move order here; typical is Nf3.  But I like to play this way for a specific reason.
3,0,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',3. c3 would go into the Smith-Morra Gambit which is interesting for both sides.  But I like 3. Nf3 because it gives me the option if black tries to hold the pawn with 3...e5 I can then play 4. c3! which IMO is a stronger position for white after the extra 3. Nf3 e5.  If black plays anything else standard (like e6 d6 g6 or Nc6) 4. Nxd4 and we're back to where we would've been after the normal move order.
4,0,4,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',More typical is d6 which leads to dragon/najdorf lines but e6 leads to paulsen lines.
5,0,5,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And we have transposed to the Paulsen variation.
6,0,6,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?!  But this is a little unusual.  Sure it's playable but this usually comes in concert with d6 not e6.  The difference?  After d6 black has the option of bringing his light-squared bishop over to the kingside.  e6 forces the bishop to remain on the queenside for awhile.
7,0,7,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard development; but this will be useful in nearly any line.
8,0,8,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Interesting; black is eschewing aggressive development by playing d6 before moving the bishop out.  One point of playing either d6 or e6 is to let one of the bishops out.  By playing them together black is committing himself to develop his bishops to the 7th rank.  This is fine and I realize this is the point behind Schveningen setups but I'll take white's position any day.
9,0,9,Be3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The knight on d4 doesn't really need another defender but e3 is a good square for this bishop pointing at both sides of the board without blocking the f-pawn or the queen.
10,0,10,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p2pp3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Again interesting.  Part of the reason for not playing Bc4 on the last move is that black can play b5 tempoing the bishop and giving him the option of Bb7.  Committing to Bd7 this early before developing the knights really reveals a lot to me about black's plans.  It basically says that all of black's offensive activity is going to be on the queenside.  
11,0,11,Qd2,b'rn1qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p2pp3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',But look at my pieces; they're in the center and well-positioned.  It means that if I go after black's kingside especially if he continues to neglect it my attack will get there first.  This move also allows for 0-0-0 avoids committing to a square for the light-squared bishop and declares that white is going after a setup like the Yugoslav in the Dragon variation.  White's plan there is something like Qd2 f3 followed by either 0-0-0 or Bc4.
12,0,12,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1npp3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Not a bad move at all but again black's kingside is in hibernation after 7 moves.
13,0,13,O-O-O,b'r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1npp3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq -',Coming out swinging!  In hindsight this isn't the most sound move as there's no need to declare white's intentions this loudly.  But I didn't want to choose a square for the bishop yet and I wanted to keep the option of f4 instead of f3 open.
14,0,14,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq -',Finally developing a kingside piece.  I know I don't want it there and I could kick it out with a pawn on g5.  But that pawn will need support.
15,0,15,f3,b'r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',f3 looks supportive.  Also continuing with the plan of a yugoslav setup.
16,0,16,Qc7,b'r3kb1r/1pqb1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',And even though I'm ahead in development this move reminds me that there' plenty of counterattacking potential for black and to be mindful of that!
17,0,17,1g4,b'r3kb1r/1pqb1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b kq g3',Here we go though!  As I declared back on move 8 that I was going to attack the kingside a pawn storm seems like the most logical way to do it.
18,0,18,1h6,b'r3kb1r/1pqb1pp1/p1nppn1p/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w kq -',Perhaps this is a good idea but it makes white's next move obvious.
19,0,19,1h4,b'r3kb1r/1pqb1pp1/p1nppn1p/8/3NP1PP/2N1BP2/PPPQ4/2KR1B1R b kq h3',!  This not only negates black's last move it basically solves white's problem of where to move his light squared bishop.  Why?  Because white wants to play g5 but needs to have the rooks connected first so that he isn't afraid of hxg5.
20,0,20,1Be7,b'r3k2r/1pqbbpp1/p1nppn1p/8/3NP1PP/2N1BP2/PPPQ4/2KR1B1R w kq -',One move away from completing development.  What's he going to do?
21,0,21,1Bd3,b'r3k2r/1pqbbpp1/p1nppn1p/8/3NP1PP/2NBBP2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b kq -',Like I said attacking the kingside is obvious and this square covers the best light squares on the g- and h-files.
22,0,22,1Rc8,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p1nppn1p/8/3NP1PP/2NBBP2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w k -',?  Okay I didn't like this move at all for black when he played it.  I thought that 0-0-0 was the best chance getting the king to safety with good counterpunching chances.  This takes away the option of tucking the king away on the queenside forcing the black king to stay in the line of fire.
23,0,23,1g5,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p1nppn1p/6P1/3NP2P/2NBBP2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b k -',Here it comes cracking the kingside open!
24,0,24,1Nxd4,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p2ppn1p/6P1/3nP2P/2NBBP2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w k -',Exchanging white's powerful knight.
25,0,25,1Bxd4,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p2ppn1p/6P1/3BP2P/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b k -',Where it's replaced by white's powerful bishop.  The queen and two bishops control an incredible amount of space.  White's rooks are connected and ready to leap down the open h-file.  I'm really happy with my chances at this point.
26,0,26,1hxg5,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p2ppn2/6p1/3BP2P/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w k -',This is a tough situation for black.  I was expecting e5 here kicking the bishop away.
27,0,27,1hxg5,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p2ppn2/6P1/3BP3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b k -',The knight must be saved.
28,0,28,1Nh5,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpp1/p2pp3/6Pn/3BP3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w k -',Again e5 was better.  Black conceivably overlooked white's next move.
29,0,29,1Bxg7,b'2r1k2r/1pqbbpB1/p2pp3/6Pn/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b k -',!  Obvious but neat!  Black goes down on material by a pawn.
30,0,30,1Rxh5,b'2r1k1r1/1pqbbpB1/p2pp3/6PR/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR4 b - -',I'm happy to swap because this will give me doubled rooks on the open h-file.
31,0,31,1Rh8+,b'2r1k2R/1pqbbpr1/p2pp3/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR4 b - -',"I'm such a stinker for in-between moves.  This one forces Bf8 ""undeveloping"" the bishop.  Also this will remove the threat on the g5 pawn."
32,0,32,1Bf8,b'2r1kb1R/1pqb1pr1/p2pp3/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2KR4 w - -',Forced.
33,0,33,1Rdh1,b'2r1kb1R/1pqb1pr1/p2pp3/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2K4R b - -',Whites rooks are now very powerful.
34,0,34,1Bc6,b'2r1kb1R/1pq2pr1/p1bpp3/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPQ4/2K4R w - -',Realizing that he needs room and some type of counterattack black tries to create some activity for himself.
35,0,35,2Qf4,b'2r1kb1R/1pq2pr1/p1bpp3/6P1/4PQ2/2NB1P2/PPP5/2K4R b - -',Looking to bring in the kitchen sink perhaps?
36,0,36,2Qe7,b'2r1kb1R/1p2qpr1/p1bpp3/6P1/4PQ2/2NB1P2/PPP5/2K4R w - -',Well look at this!  Threatening to even material up by taking on g5.
37,0,37,2Qf6,b'2r1kb1R/1p2qpr1/p1bppQ2/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPP5/2K4R b - -',Offering an exchange that will tempo the rook.
38,0,38,2Kd7,b'2r2b1R/1p1kqpr1/p1bppQ2/6P1/4P3/2NB1P2/PPP5/2K4R w - -',Deciding to not leave the c8 rook unprotected?  This move never does much.
39,0,39,2f4,b'2r2b1R/1p1kqpr1/p1bppQ2/6P1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP5/2K4R b - -',This covers the g5 square and gains a little more space.  Black already is down on material and getting crunched.
40,0,40,2Rg6,b'2r2b1R/1p1kqp2/p1bppQr1/6P1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP5/2K4R w - -',Forcing me to take his queen but who does that really benefit?
41,0,41,Kxe7,b'2r2b1R/1p2kp2/p1bpp1r1/6P1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP5/2K4R w - -',Interesting.  I also considered that he might play Bxe7.  In either case do you see how both of our bishops are lined up with enemy rooks blocked only by the e4 pawn?
42,0,42,2Rh1h7,b'2r2b1R/1p2kp1R/p1bpp1r1/6P1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP5/2K5 b - -',I decide if I fix this for myself I can play e5 and try to trap his rook.
43,0,43,2e5,b'2r2b1R/1p2kp1R/p1bp2r1/4p1P1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP5/2K5 w - -',Prevents me from playing e5 but allows the knight to invade.
44,0,44,2Nd5+,b'2r2b1R/1p2kp1R/p1bp2r1/3Np1P1/4PP2/3B4/PPP5/2K5 b - -',!  A good but obvious move!  Now black's king is being told to run losing him the f7 pawn.  (Because if Ke8 26. Rxf8 Kxf8 27. Rh8  Rg8 28. Nf6 !)
45,0,45,2Bxd5,b'2r2b1R/1p2kp1R/p2p2r1/3bp1P1/4PP2/3B4/PPP5/2K5 w - -',"Oops.  This is devastating for black.  White now has exd5 and black's rook is trapped!  The only option that doesn't result in immediate capture Rg7 fails to 26. Rxg7 Bxg7 27. Rxc8 and black is down a rook in the endgame.  Black resigns and I have the privilege of taking down an 1800  player something I haven't done in awhile!

58,3,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',The Reti opening. As in the Queen's Gambit White is trying to remove Black's QP and thereby lessen his control over e4.
59,3,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2Pp4/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Main Line but other moves are playable: 2...dxc4 2...c6 2...e6.
60,3,2,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/1PPp4/3P1N2/P3PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq b3',A gambit designed to weaken the pawn on d4 but the more conservative 4.g3 is probably better.
61,3,3,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/1pPp4/P2P1N2/4PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Hoping you will capture again and enable him to develop one of his pieces.
62,3,4,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q7/1pPp4/P2P1N2/4PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',You did right not to capture but this gives up the pawn on d4 for nothing. Both 5...e6 and 5...b3 have yielded good results.
63,3,5,Bd2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q7/1pPp4/P2P1N2/3BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White should have just played 6.Nxd4.

65,3,7,Nxd4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/q7/1pPN4/P2P4/3BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Material is level again but White has control of the centre and Black can't do much about it due to the absence of his c and d pawns.
66,3,8,Qe5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/4q3/1pPN4/P2P4/3BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',The best move.
67,3,9,Nb5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1N2q3/1pP5/P2P4/3BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',The simple 8.Nb3 was better. I don't think he looked far enough ahead.
68,3,10,1Nxa8,b'Nnbk1bnr/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1pP5/P2P4/3BPPPP/qN1QKB1R b K -',White has regained his rook but how does he extricate his knight?
69,3,11,1bxa3,b'Nnbk1bnr/pp3ppp/4p3/8/2P5/p2P4/3BPPPP/qN1QKB1R w K -',Black now has a very dangerous pawn.

According to my experience the standard line seems to be 3.Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6. Black Bishop's pair is counter balanced by Black's doubled pawn on the c-file.

Black has the Bishop's pair and a Knight while White remains only with the dark-squared Bishop (but two Knights). 2. Black seems to has a slight structural problem with the doubled pawns on the c-file while White's pawn structure is sound. 3. White has a small advance in development with a knight out and also the trait.


Now can we build a general plan around those observations? Generally speaking White would prefer the centre to remain closed; on the other hand Black would like to open it up so that its Bishop's pair becomes more efficient (4. dxc6 was already a step in that direction).  White would like to find advanced posts for his knights while Black should strive not to create any."

Avoiding this problem are 5. O-O and 5. a3. The latter seems not so good because it places pawns on the squares that would be better used for White remaining Bishop. 

5. O-O places my King to safety does not open the position and permit to observe Black reaction before committing to anything."

352,15,27,2Qxd6,b'r6r/pp1b2qp/2nQ1n2/7k/8/2N4P/PPP3P1/4RR1K b - -',so i win a pawn and the piece advantage lessens... positional advantage still strong for white.
353,15,28,2Rhg8,b'r5r1/pp1b2qp/2nQ1n2/7k/8/2N4P/PPP3P1/4RR1K w - -',I think black is 2 moves too late with this one but it is definitely a good move.  1 move away from mate so it needs reacting.

Positionally very dangerous as white can threaten to h2 and with all those rooks open without pawns blocking their view.

White needs to deal with the pinned double-attacked knight; castling out of the pin still seems attractive providing more firepower to the hoped-for (and unrealised) kingside breakthrough.  But 10.

After the insipriation of 5.h4 white has now expended three moves on kingside pawns without yet succeeding in threatening a single of black's pieces.  With 14. g4 white threatens f5 next and an effective kingside breakthrough but the threat is too slow-moving to maintain initiative.  Perhaps if 10. Qf3 instead of d3 white would have had the opportuity for 14. f5 and a sustained attack.  I still fail to do what I have seen done so effectively namely the advancing of a SINGLE pawn as a thorn in the king side.  In this game MANY pawns are shown to be cumbersome.

As played the long-awaited pawn push does little other more than open a file for black's rook and suicide white's e pawn.  Here benrous shows his beginner's tendency to remain attached to a preconceived gameplan rather than staying awake to the constant flux of the game.

Given white's poor positioning especially the blocked-in LSB and the weak castle which requires rook and knight to stay protective of the weak c3 square it is hard to find a better move in this position--a ""quiet"" move seems called for."

This game is imperfect like so many of mine but it was a good slugfest. Analysing it was interesting and I was surprised at the depth of some of the variations.

With the Tarrasch white aims for positional pressure.

We now have a standard French defence isolated queen pawn position (IQP) position. White has more space but black is sound and has harmonious piece development and often targets the white king whereas white plays to create a second weakness on the king-side. The person who understands the nuances of IQP positions will fare best.

However I think the open e-file (rather than white having a pawn at e3 or e2 in Queens Gambit positions with IQPs which black can target)  means that if white can securely blockade the d-pawn he should be better. Korchnoi and Uhlmann are experts on the black side Karpov on the white."

An interesting game mistakes by both players. Blacks Rfd8 as called was a mistake which should have been exploited by white. Whites rook sacrifice was the blunder which allowed black in for the clinical finish. A game decided on the 19th and 20th moves. I was happy with the result and the opening. However I think I will need to study the opening a bit more as my 19th move was a shocker and should have been seen by both myself and opponent.

I made a good step at controlling the center here while the en passant means he gave up a key central square that was really annoying me. The downside was that it weekened my kingside.

After analysing we came up with example how this game could have continued 23.Bxf3 exf3 24.Nxf3 Nf4 25.Bxf4 Rxf4 26.Qd3 Rxg4  27.hxg4 Qxg4  28.Kh1 Qh3  29.Kg1 Bf5 30.Qd1 Bxc3 31.Rxc3 Kh8 32.Nd4 Rg8  33.Rg3 Rxg3  34.fxg3 Qxg3  35.Kh1 Qh4  36.Kg1 cxd4 with really difficult position to play.
619,25,28,2Nxe2,b'r1b2rk1/ppnq2b1/3p2np/PPpP4/2P1N1P1/R6P/4NP1B/3Q1RK1 b - -',I myself favour this option by white more.

I wasnt feeling comfortable at all because this was slow position where white just tries to push his pawns through my defense and I just could find any good kind of counterplay.
621,25,30,2Bxe5,b'r1b2rk1/ppnq2b1/3p3p/PPpPB3/2P1N1P1/R6P/4NP2/3Q1RK1 b - -',This was expected.

623,25,32,2Qf7,b'r1b2rk1/ppn2qb1/7p/PPpPp3/2P1N1P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',My computer favoured 26...Ne8 more.
624,25,33,Ne8,b'r1b1nrk1/pp3qb1/7p/PPNPp3/2P3P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',I was sure that I need to sacrifice material to stop this pawn storm it is amazing how dangerous whites pawns are and this is good example of effective pawn pushing on queenside in Kings indian.
625,25,34,2Nce4,b'r1b1nrk1/pp3qb1/7p/PP1Pp3/2P1N1P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 b - -',White opens his pawns way.
626,25,35,2Nf6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3qb1/5n1p/PP1Pp3/2P1N1P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',Now I offered a trade by thinking of playing queen to 6th rank which could be effective in stopping those pawns.
627,25,36,Qxf6,b'r1b2rk1/pp4b1/5q1p/PP1Pp3/2P3P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',White accepts the trade.
628,25,37,3c5,b'r1b2rk1/pp4b1/5q1p/PPPPp3/6P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 b - -',Definetly the best move from view as white just keeps pushing and try to win somehing from queenside playing.
629,25,38,3a6,b'r1b2rk1/1p4b1/p4q1p/PPPPp3/6P1/R5NP/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',Something needs to be done for these pawns.
630,25,39,3Nh5,b'r1b2rk1/1p4b1/p4q1p/PPPPp2N/6P1/R6P/5P2/3Q1RK1 b - -',I was looking just 31.d6 and trying to think what I do after it and that is why this move became as a surprise. This moved seemed to be even more effective at the time but in my after analysis I think this move to be equal with 31.d6.
631,25,40,3Qf7,b'r1b2rk1/1p3qb1/p6p/PPPPp2N/6P1/R6P/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',I dont know why I moved queen out of 6th rank where I wanted it to be.
632,25,41,3b6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3qb1/pP5p/P1PPp2N/6P1/R6P/5P2/3Q1RK1 b - -',White keeps pushing even more.
633,25,42,3Bd7,b'r4rk1/1p1b1qb1/pP5p/P1PPp2N/6P1/R6P/5P2/3Q1RK1 w - -',I need to protect c6 and try to get more help by opening a8 rook.
634,25,43,3Qc2,b'r4rk1/1p1b2q1/pP5p/P1PPp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/5RK1 b - -',Its good to get rook to join pawn pushing too.
635,25,44,3Bb5,b'r4rk1/1p4q1/pP5p/PbPPp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/5RK1 w - -',Im not exactly sure but this move can be a mistake as by moving 35.Rb1 Rad8 36.Rxb5 axb5 37.c6 b4 38.Rb3 Rxd5 39.c7 Rxa5 40.c8Q white would win.
636,25,45,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1p4q1/pP5p/PbPPp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 w - -',There are better moves in here like 35...Rf6 and then game could follow by 36.Rg3 Raf8 37.Rg2(not 37.Rxe5 Rxf2 38.Qc3 Rf1  39.Kh2 R8f2  40.Rg2 Rf3 and position is great for black) or the game could continue by 35...Rf5 36.Rxe5 Raf8 37.Qc3 Rxf2.
637,25,46,3c6,b'3r1rk1/1p4q1/pPP4p/Pb1Pp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 b - -',White goes for the direct option.
638,25,47,3Rxd5,b'5rk1/1p4q1/pPP4p/Pb1rp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 w - -',Pawn must be taken. 36...Rd6 is good try but after 37.cxb7 Qxb7 38.Rxe5 Qg7 39.Re6 Rxe6 40.dxe6 Qf6 41.Re3 Bc6 42.Qe2 Bb7 43.e7 Re8 44.Re6 Qg7 45.Qd3 Kh8 46.f4 and black would have fallen to deep trouble. In this game I didnt calculate that far as after analysing that option few moves it just felt to be too dangerous and I left that idea.
639,25,48,3c7,b'5rk1/1pP3q1/pP5p/Pb1rp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 b - -',Now white has dangerous 7th rank pawn that is really well protected.
640,25,49,3Bd7,b'5rk1/1pPb2q1/pP5p/P2rp3/6P1/R6P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 w - -',I need to put some kind of stop to this pawn.
641,25,50,Bc8,b'2b2rk1/1pP3q1/pP5p/P2rp3/6P1/2R4P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 w - -',And now the pawn isint going to become queen right away.
642,25,51,3Rc5,b'2b2rk1/1pP3q1/pP5p/P1Rrp3/6P1/7P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 b - -',My opponent had 1min in his clock right now and he was one move away from 40th move increasement and I had about 8min. My opponent had played really well even that he didnt have so much time to spend on his moves it needs skill to use time in the most effective way and so that you wont make hestitated move because of time.
643,25,52,3Rd4,b'2b2rk1/1pP3q1/pP5p/P1R1p3/3r2P1/7P/2Q2P2/4R1K1 w - -',I didnt want to change our rooks by playing 39...Rxc5 40.Qxc5 41.f4 which I think to be more effective.
644,25,53,4Qb3+,b'2b2rk1/1pP3q1/pP5p/P1R1p3/3r2P1/1Q5P/5P2/4R1K1 b - -',White had position where he can make this kind of move that you dont have to think much so it was easy for him to get increasement. Thinking of options like 40.Rexe5? or 40.Rcxe5?! arent so good as this option and by looking at my opponents time these kind of moves needs more time to think. 40.Rexe5? would continue by 40...Bxg4 41.Re7 Qxe7 42.Qg6  Qg7 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 44.hxg4 Rxg4  45.Kh2 Rc8 and option 40.Rcxe5?! Rxg4  41.hxg4 Qxg4  42.Kf1 Qh3  43.Kg1 Qg4  44.Kh2 Qh3  45.Kg1 Qg4  isint good as white is playing for win.

I must admire him that he has been able to launch correct moves after another without slight mistakes. Options like 41.Rexe5 are not so effectise as by playing 41...Bxg4 42.Qg3 Bxh3 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 or 41.Rcxe5 Bxg4 42.Qg3 Bxh3 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 44.Re7  Kg8 position isint so good for white as it could be.

648,25,57,4Kh7,b'2b2r2/1pP3qk/pP5p/P6R/3rp1P1/4Q2P/5P2/4R1K1 w - -',42.Kg8 wont work as 43.Rxh6 Rf3(not 43.Qxh6 Qxh6 Rxh6) 44.Rg6 Rxe3 45.Rxg7  Kxg7 46.Rxe3 and draw chance might come after 46...Rd2.
649,25,58,4Qxd4,b'2b2r2/1pP4k/pP5q/P7/3Qp1P1/7P/5P2/4R1K1 b - -',White trusts that his queensides 7th rank pawn with other will help him as they do.
650,25,59,4Qxh3,b'2b2r2/1pP4k/pP6/P7/3Qp1P1/7q/5P2/4R1K1 w - -',The best option that tries still something even that this is quite useless right now.
651,25,60,4Kg2,b'2b2r2/1pP4k/pP6/P7/3QR1Pq/8/5PK1/8 b - -',Even at this stage white makes these calm moves even that he could try to go for more direct options.
652,25,61,4Kg6,b'2b2r2/1pP5/pP4k1/P7/3QR1Pq/8/5PK1/8 w - -',46...Rh8 47.Qd6 Rg8 48.f3 is too dangerous.
653,25,62,4Qd6+,b'2b2r2/1pP5/pP1Q2k1/P7/4R1Pq/8/5PK1/8 b - -',White goes for winning move by trading queens.
654,25,63,4Qf6,b'2b2r2/1pP5/pP1Q1qk1/P7/4R1P1/8/5PK1/8 w - -',47...Rf6 doesnt help anything as 48.Qg3 Qg5 49.Qd3 Bf5 50.Qd5
655,25,64,Kxf6,b'2b2r2/1pP5/pP3k2/P7/4R1P1/8/5PK1/8 w - -',My bishop has been just standing on c8 and that material advantage has been useless for me.
656,25,65,4f3,b'2b2r2/1pP5/pP3k2/P7/4R1P1/5P2/6K1/8 b - -',White has strong queenside pawns and now he has even strong kingside pawns that are free to advance nobody would want to be me right now.
657,25,66,Be6,b'6r1/1pP5/pP2bk2/P7/4R1P1/5PK1/8/8 w - -',Im just moving as I had lost my intrest in this game already or I was living in somekind of fairy tale that white echanges his rook to my bishop and I go for draw.
658,25,67,Bc8,b'2b3r1/1pP5/pP3k2/P7/4RKP1/5P2/8/8 w - -',nothing is happening from my part.

663,25,72,6f6,b'2b5/1pP2k2/pP1K1P2/P2R2P1/8/8/8/6r1 b - -',Now its only matter of time when white will get his pawns through
664,25,73,Rd1+,b'2b5/1pP2k2/pP1K1P2/P3R1P1/8/8/8/3r4 w - -',and I go back for my own fun.

666,25,75,6Re7+,b'2b5/1pP1Rk2/pP3P2/P5P1/8/8/3K4/5r2 b - -',Now I resigned and I have probably been irritating for my opponent as I kept moving so I felt it was right to say sorry that I kept continuing and so I did. It looks like I need to go back to learn basics as material doesnt win against mighty pawn arsenal. Somebody might wonder why I didnt try to go for draw by someway and truth is I didnt find one and other reason is that I hate draws as I want only to win but in lost position I will go for draw if I find it even that I hate it.

669,26,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Im quite sure that my opponent was waiting for Najdorf as he knows that Im bad loser and if I lose in one of my favourite openings I try it until I win but this time I didnt go for Najdorf even that its one of my favourite openings.
670,26,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I was finally ready to launch Dragon on official game as I had trained this opening very much and I was totally ready for ány kind of challenge in this opening.

675,26,8,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/p1q1ppbp/6p1/3Q4/8/4BP2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',Now I have gained my compensation for lost pawn as I can attack whites queenside from open lines with support of my bishops.
676,26,9,1Qxa8,b'Q1b2rk1/p1q1ppbp/6p1/8/8/4BP2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b - -',14.Qc5 is normal response but 14.Qxa8 is really intresting as white changes his queen to rooks. This move might look odd but its totally okay.
677,26,10,1Rd2,b'5k2/p1q1ppbp/6p1/5b2/8/4BP2/PPPR2PP/2K2B1R b - -',Its not easy for white to defend and black has to be cautious too. This is intresting situation.

685,26,18,2Bxf7,b'1q6/p3pBbk/6p1/5b1p/7P/1P2BP2/P1PR2P1/2K4R b - -',Now my opponent made a mistake in time trouble I dont know how I got this idea that my opponent will eat my pawn for sure I was completely sure about it. 20.g4 hxg4 21.h5 would be the right way.
686,26,19,2Qe5,b'8/p3pBbk/6p1/4qb1p/7P/1P2BP2/P1PR2P1/2K4R w - -',This is the only winning move on this situation.

688,26,21,2Re1,b'8/p3p1k1/6b1/q6p/7P/1P3P2/P1PR2P1/2K1R3 b - -',White keeps playing accurately.
689,26,22,Kf6,b'8/p3R3/5kb1/7p/7P/1P3P2/q1PR2P1/2K5 w - -',Well it really doesnt matter where I move my king as long as I do not move it to g8 or h8.

691,26,24,Bxc2,b'8/8/7k/p7/3q3P/1P6/2b1K1R1/6R1 w - -',White resign. It is hard to say are those rooks better or worse than queen on these kind of situations. This time my queen proved to be better. Our team went to victory as this game was last one so our team won match with result 3-2.
692,27,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Mon Capitan asked me to annotate a few games.  I have chosen this one because I'm expecting to lose it.( His ranking has been as high as 2089)

694,27,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It is a material advantage.  White can get it back after e3 or e4 if they choose.
695,27,3,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I normally don't block my bishop diagonals but becuase of the ranking difference( he is on the rise again) I am going defensive.  I am likely to go Bd7 as result anyway.  Long term plan is to lay in for a siege from white on the kingside with perhaps some forays from me down the queenside with a knight especially if he doesn't play a3.
696,27,4,b5,b'r2q1rk1/2pbbpp1/p3pn1p/np2N3/3PPP2/2N1B3/PP2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - b6',The defence is in place.  This move is likely to provoke the a3 but it will keep the bishop back from the centre so the castle attack that is coming from white will hopefully be focused along h g f without the backup support through the centre.  This might sound odd but I might start my queenside foray with a focus on e4
697,27,5,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/2pbbpp1/p2npn1p/1p2N3/3PPP2/P1N1BB2/1P4PP/R3QRK1 w - -',Looks like he has seen the queenside foray and negated it.  This is to get the rook out and working after the exchange of pieces in the centre OR the king side attack from white.  I may try to speed it up with b4 leading to a pawn exchange that opens a and b

The exchange will make it  2 but improve my position because I should then be able to control and use most of the queenside of the board.  I should also be able to keep the pawn(nicely advanced aint it) and protect it.
700,27,8,Rb2,b'3q1rk1/2p1bpp1/p3p2p/8/P2PQP2/2p1B3/1r4PP/RR4K1 w - -',See if we can shift the exchange to b2 - only 1 unsafe square in front of pawn rather than two.  Or he may pull bishop from the centre to keep the exchange on b1 which may give oppurtunities to pick up pawns as two are isolated.
701,27,9,Rd8,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2qp2p/8/P2P1P2/bQ2B3/1p4PP/1R4K1 w - -',The next few moves are for position.  While d is good b is better to control with the Q and/or R.  Also getting my Q down on b3  or c1 could be useful.  If the pawns on a6 and a4 are cleared moving the rook across to a with the Q on b3 c1 or b4 could also be useful.

Black seems to be preparing for Bb7 which suits me fine because it weakens his d7. How can I exploit that? Lets try to open d-rank. Opening d-rank also looks good for me because I get to move my knight away from then king's side and get more room to manoeuvre against the avalanche when it continues.

Qc5 would have saved the pawn. Had black captured it knight would have gone to d5 threatening both rook at b5 and queen on d5. If the bishop had captured the knight my queen would have captured the rook at b6 with check. After that moving king to a8 would have been checkmate with Ra1 and Kc8 would have lead for pawn capturing bishop at d5. After that it would have taken a couple of moves for victory. Black's rook at d8 effectively blocked with his king. Queen blocked by my rook and d-pawn. My second rook free to move for the kill thru a1 and finally a8.

Much less explored than the Slav 2...c6 Queen's Gambit Accepted 2...dxc4 or Orthodox Systems beginning with 2...e6. I very much like the development of the Nc6 here as it is quite justified by the c2-c4 pawn advance wich make possible immediate pressure on Pawn d4. One drawback of this method is the obligatory investment of Black's pair of Bishops to maintain his opening goals but Knights are pleasant beasts also in combat.  
766,30,1,Qxd5,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',For the moment the Queen is not to be dislodged from d5 as 3.Nc3 loses the d Pawn.

But wait... this is the move advised by theory !  What is this 7...Nge7 for ? First 7...Nge7 is loosing a pawn but accelerates development. Second should Black recover the e5 pawn White in the meantime could have made significant positional progresses to take the advantage. In short this is on these kind of imbalance that new theoritical paths are growing until the initial question is more or less solved or not...
770,30,5,Nxd5,b'r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3nP3/8/2B1P3/PP3PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Ok here we are : Black is threatening to take on c3 and then regaining his pawn on e5 with good prospects.

It doesn't look natural at all to give away this bishop but there is some logic behind the move. Eliminating the f6 knight takes away some pressure from e4.

He is also trying to prove the claim that two well placed knights in the centre can be just as strong as the two bishops.

White has disrupted Black's kingside pawns and Black's counter will be ... 0-0-0 evacuating the king to the wide open spaces of the queenside.  As it turns out this has consequences in the endgame.

884,35,10,2Rxd8,b'1kbR4/4b2p/p1n1p3/1pq2p2/5N2/5NPB/PPP1Q2P/1K6 b - -',The logical continuation which forces Black's reply since  23 ... Bxd8 24 Nxe6 Qd5 25 Nxd8 Qxd8 26 Bg2 hands White a solid plus.  The second pair of rooks disappears and Black's control of e5 is weakened.  After the following exchanges Black's weakness on the dark square complex b6 c5 d4 e5 f4 f6 and g7 will become apparent.

886,35,12,2Nfe5,b'1kbn4/2q1b2p/p3p3/1p2Np2/8/3N2PB/PPP1Q2P/1K6 b - -',Since it's pointless to attack the e pawn White decides to neutralize Black's bishop pair by blockading his central pawns and occupying the long diagonal with his bishop.  Lifting the blockade will mean more exchanges which favors White.
887,35,13,Bb7,b'1k1n4/1bq4p/p2bp3/1p2Np2/8/3N2P1/PPP1Q1BP/1K6 w - -',White can't be allowed to dominate the diagonal.
888,35,14,2Bf3,b'1k1n4/1bq4p/p2bp3/1p2Np2/8/3N1BP1/PPP1Q2P/1K6 b - -',This move may seem odd but it has a clear objective:  controlling e5 without giving Black control of the a8-h1 diagonal.  Allowing Black to capture on g2 would deflect the queen from the e file; but capturing on b7 would bring Black's queen to the long diagonal threatening an unpleasant check on h1.  The solution is to place the bishop on a square protected by the knight on e5 so that 27 ... Bxf3 can be met with 28 Nxf3 retaining control of the key central square.  White has no advantage and his first priority must be to restrain Black's passed e pawn.
889,35,15,3Qe5+,b'1k6/7p/p1q1p3/1p2Qp2/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K6 b - -',Only the queens are left and the White queen has arrived on e5 with check.  After 31 ... Kb7 the game will still be dead even with Black's central passed pawn balanced against White's secure king position the exposed position of Black's king and the possibility that White may create a passed pawn of his own on the either wing.   White thinking he'd frittered away his advantage with 19 Nf4 offered a draw that Black refused.

891,35,17,3Qd7,b'8/1k1q3p/p3p3/1p2Qp2/8/1P4P1/P1P4P/1K6 w - -',Already the geometry of the position is making itself felt.  The Black h pawn is a potential target but even more important is the a1-h8 diagonal particularly g7.  White's queen plays an important defensive role on the hot diagonal by covering b2 c3 and d4 and if she can arrive at g7 with check the Black h pawn will be lost unless Black can interpose his queen.  This limits the Black queen's mobility  On the queenside there is nothing but open space around the Black king and if White can force a pawn to a5 then b6 will become dangerously weak.  Black could prevent this with 32 ... b4 which may have been a better option than the move played.   Or he could force a draw with 32 ... Qh1   33 Kb2 Qxh2 34 Qxe6 Qxg3 35 Qxf5 Qg7  but he seems to have overestimated the strength of the passed  e pawn.
892,35,18,3a3,b'8/1k1q3p/p3p3/1p2Qp2/8/PP4P1/2P4P/1K6 b - -',Other possibilities are 33 Qc5 and 33 Kc1 neither of which holds out the slightest hope for a White advantage.

894,35,20,3Qd4,b'8/1k5p/p1q1p3/1p3p2/3Q4/PP4P1/2P4P/1K6 b - -',White's queen now covers a4 b4 and b6 as well as the a1-h8 diagonal.  White can play this because 34 ... Qh1  is met by 35 Kb2 Qxh2 36 Qd7+  Kb8 37 Qxe6.  Now 37 ... Qxg3 walks into 38 Qb6  Kc8 39 Qxa6  Kd7 40 Qxb5 .  This invasion of b6 followed by a series of checks will recur later in the game and in a number of possible variations.  Black is still not in trouble but White has a small edge.
895,35,21,3a4,b'8/1kq4p/p3p3/1p3p2/P2Q4/1P4P1/2P4P/1K6 b - -',Since Black has chosen passive defence White begins a series of pawn advances that increase the pressure on the Black position.
896,35,22,3Qe7,b'8/1k2q2p/p3p3/1p3p2/P2Q4/1P4P1/2P4P/1K6 w - -',Black avoids 35 ... bxa4 36 Qb4+  Qb6 37 Qxa4 but he doesn't find the best alternative:  35 ... Kc6 36 g4 Qxh2 37 gxf5 exf5 36 Qf6  Qd6 39 Qxf5 Qd1  40 Kb2 Qd4  41 c3 Qd2 .  Now the White pawn reaches a5 from which it supports the queen's invasion of b6 and sits only 3 moves from the queening square should the a6 pawn fall.  
897,35,23,3a5,b'8/1k2q2p/p3p3/Pp3p2/3Q4/1P4P1/2P4P/1K6 b - -',Even so it's hard to say if this was the best move.   36 g4 Qf7 (36 ... fxg4 37 Qxg4 e5 38 Qe4  Kc7 39 Qe3 bxa4 40 Qa7  Kd8 41 Qa8  kc7 42 Qxa6 axb3 43 Qa7 ) 37 g5 bxa4 38 Qb4  Ka7  39 Qxa4 e5 40 Qc6 f4 41 Qf6 Qc7 42 Kb2 also appears strong; but fixing the Black a pawn and controlling b6 seemed more appealing especially since the advantage obtained by 36 g4 doesn't appear to be decisive.  The real trick for White will be to advance his g pawn to g5 creating a fast-moving pawn majority on the g and h files.  That threat cuts both ways because it also means Black has to be very cautious about pushing his f pawn.
898,35,24,3Qc7,b'8/1kq4p/p3p3/Pp3p2/3Q4/1P4P1/2P4P/1K6 w - -',Black can't concede b6.  Both 36 ... Ka8 and 36 ... Kc8 drop the a pawn.
899,35,25,3Qe3,b'8/1kq4p/p3p3/Pp3p2/8/1P2Q1P1/2P4P/1K6 b - -',This is stronger than 37 Qf6 because it keeps an eye on b6.  White rightly avoids 37 b4 which would cripple his queenside pawn majority and weaken his king position.  Should Black later attempt (or be forced) to exchange queens variations might arise in which White's ability to force a passed c pawn would be decisive.  And once the g pawn reaches g5 Black could only exchange queens if it meant the immediate queening of one of his central pawns since White could then force passed pawns on the c and g or c and h files against which the Black king would have no defence.
900,35,26,3Qd6,b'8/1k5p/p2qp3/Pp3p2/8/1P2Q1P1/2P4P/1K6 w - -',37 ... Qc6 was also playable.  37 ... Qxa5 loses material but would probably have resulted in a draw after  37 ...

Black has liquidated the threat on a5 broken up the White king's pawn cover and threatens to create his own passed a pawn--all at the expense of a single pawn.
901,35,27,3h4,b'8/1k5p/p2qp3/Pp3p2/7P/1P2Q1P1/2P5/1K6 b - h3',This maintains White's tiny edge and sets Black some problems since now after 39 g4 there's no pawn on h2 for the queen to capture as in 38 g4 fxg4 39 Qe4  Kc7 40 Qxg4 Qxh2 41 Qxe6.  
902,35,28,3Kc8,b'2k5/7p/p2qp3/Pp3p2/7P/1P2Q1P1/2P5/1K6 w - -',Or 38 ... Qd1  39 Kb2 Qd6 40 h5 Qc6 41 Qd4 Qc7 42 g4 fxg4 43 Qxg4 Qe5  44 Ka2 Qf5.   Black has no real counter play because of his weak pawns on a6 and h7 and his unwillingness to exchange his e pawn.  If his queen strays too far White either captures the e pawn or invades b6.  If Black pushes the f pawn White's g pawn reaches g5.
903,35,29,Kb8,b'1k6/7p/p2qp3/Pp3p2/7P/1P3QP1/2P5/1K6 w - -',Black meets the imaginary threat of 40 Qa8  by moving his king onto a less favorable square.  Now when the White queen finally penetrates to b6 it will arrive with check and the a pawn will fall also with check.  It's probably worth noting that it's been 9 moves since White's queen arrived at e5 and Black's central pawns are still on e6 and f5.
904,35,30,4g4,b'1k6/7p/p2qp3/Pp3p2/6PP/1P3Q2/2P5/1K6 b - -',This push had to be made sooner or later and it's more effective now than it would have been a move or so ago because after 40 ... fxg4 41 Qxg4 White's queen is preventing a check on d1 and threatening to win Black's h pawn (42 Qg8  and 43 Qxh7 ).  Black is forced to either defend the seventh rank with his queen (41 ... Qd7 41 ... Qe7) or slightly better bring his king to c7; but after 41 ... Kc7 42 Qg7  Qd7 43 Qg1 Kd6 44 Qb6  White has a strong although perhaps not a winning advantage.

The f pawn is now too far advanced for the White king to stop so White is no longer able to seize control of the a1-h8 diagonal by interposing his queen on c3 and after an exchange of queens he'll lose the race to the queening square unless he can force h4-h5 without allowing the f pawn to advance.

911,35,37,4e5,b'1k6/7p/p2q4/Pp2p1PP/5p2/1P6/2P2Q2/1K6 w - -',This appears to be designed to hold back the g pawn.  43 ... Qd1  44 Kb2 Qxh5 45 Qb6  Kc8 46 Qxa6  Kb8 47 Qd6  and Black's busted.
912,35,38,4g6,b'1k6/7p/p2q2P1/Pp2p2P/5p2/1P6/2P2Q2/1K6 b - -',Anyway.  As advertised the White kingside pawns advance much faster than the Black pawns on the central files.  After 44 ... hxg6 the threat of Qb6  and a passed pawn on h6 will be too much for Black to overcome.  The Black queen can't keep the White queen out of b6 because an exchange of queens leads to a new White queen on h8 and once the White queen reaches b6 with check the game's as good as over.
913,35,39,4h6,b'1k6/8/p2q2pP/Pp2p3/5p2/1P6/2P2Q2/1K6 b - -',The h pawn can't be stopped and Black's extra pawn wouldn't matter even if he could hold it.

915,35,41,Qd7,b'1k6/3q4/p5pP/Pp2p3/5p2/1P6/1KP2Q2/8 w - -',There are no more checks.  Once again Black can't offer an exchange of queens by 46 ... Qd4  because after 47 Qxd4 exd4 48 h7 f3 49 h8Q  the f pawn will soon be lost.
916,35,42,4Qb6+,b'1k6/3q4/pQ4pP/Pp2p3/5p2/1P6/1KP5/8 b - -',Black could resign here.  The queen will win the a and g pawns after which Black has no meaningful counterplay and no way to stop the h pawn.  47 ... Qb7 48 h7 is hopeless:  48 ...

917,35,43,5Kb2,b'1k6/7P/6Q1/Pp2p3/5p2/1P6/1KP4q/8 b - -',This position says it all.  White's king is safely nestled among his queenside pawns his h pawn is ready to queen and his a pawn is poised to create mating threats against the exposed Black king.  On the other hand the Black e and f pawns that once appeared to offer chances for a win have managed to advance one rank--to squares where they prevent the Black queen from giving check.
918,35,44,5a6,b'7Q/8/P1k5/1p2p3/8/1P3p2/1KP5/8 b - -',The fastest way.  Now when the queen arrives on f6 Black will either have to allow the a pawn to gueen or let his king fall into a mating net.

920,35,46,5Qf6+,b'8/8/Pk3Q2/1p2p3/8/1P3p2/1KP5/8 b - -',The Black king can't block the a pawn:  57 ... Ka6 58 Qc6 and mate next move.  If the King escapes to a5 or c5 it can no longer catch the a pawn.  The last try is 57 ... Kc7 58 Qe7+  and the a pawn queens or Black gets mated.
921,35,47,5Ka7,b'8/k7/P4Q2/1p2p3/8/1P3p2/1KP5/8 w - -',If you're going to play on a queen down and take a couple of long postponements into the bargain then the least you should do is have the courtesy to put up a fight.  Instead Black makes the weakest move available.  It's mate in 2.

962,38,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the interesting aspects of playing 1.Nf3 is to transpose to Queen's pawn openings with ready antidotes to a number of thematic replies : Nimzo-Indian Queen's Indian Grunfeld... and here's the case for the Dutch Opening. Notice that there is no real antidotes to the Slav Semi-Slav system or King's Indian with the 1.Nf3 move order to enter Queen's pawn openings.
963,38,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',Ready to transpose to the Dutch opening after 2.d4  but there's something unusual waiting for Black.
964,38,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not the Lisitsin Gambit (2.e4 fxe 3.Ng5) which is now not so dangerous but something similar and trickier to answer which begins with an apparently modest move 2.d3 . What I very much like about 1.Nf3 is that the opponent generally does not know how to react correctly as it depends on the mood of his opponent to decide upon creating huge complications or just playing for small positional advantages. 
965,38,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',About every plausible moves have been tried here for Black  2...d5 trying a stonewall without d4 is not a good idea so the flexible 3.c4 must be a good answer. 2...Nc6 encounters 3.d4 and the Queen's knight is misplaced. 
966,38,4,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',it is really dangerous to accept the pawn after 3...fxe4 4.dxe4 Nxe4 5.Bd3 as games published show.
967,38,5,exf5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5P2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4.e5 or 4.Nc3 were also nice tries. The game move should be the most principled one as the following exchange of white-squared bishops and opening of the center with d4 should highly favour White with white square weaknesses for Black in the open.
968,38,6,e5,b'r2qkb1r/pppn2pp/3p1n2/4p3/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq e6',Now White had just to exchange pawns on e5 and playing quietly and purposefully. Black has a huge task ahead to maintain equality dynamically as his white square weaknesses will be a permanent burden.

I am a fan of the Torre attack* and in this game I hope to bring out some of its general principles as well as a few of my own touches. Although wikipedia suggests that the Torre is not particularly advantageous for White Nigel Short** categorises it as a good opening describing it as a very handy and easy-to-learn system and says that White can play the first three moves no matter what Blacks set-up.

* Late Edit: Because of the move order strictly speaking this is the Trompovsky attack (Ruth Opovcensky opening) (A45) rather than the Torre.

It also gives access for the LSB (light square bishop) to land on d3 so that it can snipe at h7 handy for a King hunt.

991,39,3,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/p3bpp1/1p2pn1p/2pp4/3P3B/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ c6',An excellent and well favoured move by Black this usually sharpens the play.
992,39,4,Rc1,b'rnbq1rk1/p3bpp1/1p2pn1p/2pp4/3P3B/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/2RQK2R b K -',Now my personal touches warts and all are coming in! Whites thinking was that if there is a pawn exchange there will be a nice channel for his rook or should Black advance his pawn to c4 Whites LSB can find a good home on b1 as a long range sniper while not trapping in that rook on a1.
993,39,5,c4,b'rnbq1rk1/p3bpp1/1p2pn1p/3p4/2pP3B/2PBPN2/PP1N1PPP/2RQK2R w K -',Sure enough.
994,39,6,1Bxf6,b'rnbq1rk1/p3bpp1/4pB1p/1p1p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/1BRQK2R b K -',This exchange means that the knight no longer defends the critical h7 square the area where White is trying to exert pressure.
995,39,7,1Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pp1/4pb1p/1p1p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/PPQN1PPP/1BR1K2R b K -',Black did not earn his good rating by falling for simple threats like this; Whites hope was purely to force Black to weaken his own pawn structure in his Kings Castle; it is difficult for me to see how he could avoid doing so.
996,39,8,1h4,b'rnbq1rk1/p4p2/4pbpp/1p1p4/2pP3P/2P1PN2/PPQN1PP1/1BR1K2R b K h3',Trying to put more pressure on the vulnerable Castle.
997,39,9,1Bg7,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pb1/4p1pp/1p1p4/2pP3P/2P1PN2/PPQN1PP1/1BR1K2R w K -',"A good consolidating defensive move and frees his f pawn.

998,39,10,1h5,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pb1/4p1pp/1p1p3P/2pP4/2P1PN2/PPQN1PP1/1BR1K2R b K -',Continuing with the theme.
999,39,11,1Qf6,b'rnb2rk1/p4pb1/4pqpp/1p1p3P/2pP4/2P1PN2/PPQN1PP1/1BR1K2R w K -',Seems to make sense to me.
1000,39,12,1Ke2,b'r1b2rk1/p2n1pb1/4pqpp/1p1p3P/2pP2P1/2P1PN2/PPQNKP2/1BR4R b - -',Never mind castling White wants to keep the initiative so his majesty can jump up and his rook can fly underneath him. In situations like this the rapid mobilisation of forces is all.
1001,39,13,Nf8,b'r1b1rnk1/p4pb1/4pqpp/1p1p3P/2pP2P1/2P1PN2/PPQNKP2/1B4RR w - -',I think perhaps if Black had played g5 instead either now or at some other close  opportune moment White would never have looked so clever after all it would have locked things up a bit.
1002,39,14,Qf5,b'r1b1rnk1/p4pb1/4p1pp/1p1p1qPP/2pP4/2P1PN2/PPQNKP2/1B4RR w - -',I fully understand this move Black needs to take the sting out of his opponents attack and a good way to do that is to swap Queens; I too would have been minded so but
1003,39,15,1Qd1,b'r1b1rnk1/p4pb1/4p1pp/1p1p1qPP/2pP4/2P1PN2/PP1NKP2/1B1Q2RR b - -',"Her majesty does not have to engage her peer she can simply step aside and let the shy LSB face the music. Blacks Queen has nowhere to run. Black an honourable opponent resigns on the spot.

If you are still awake I hope you enjoyed my first stab at an annotation all feedback is welcome.
