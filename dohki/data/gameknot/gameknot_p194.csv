0,0,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Advance Variation.
1,0,1,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The standard response developing the lsb outside the pawn chain.
2,0,2,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',At the time that Kotronias wrote his book this line had fallen out of favour with players like Short preferring 4. Nf3 and 5. Be2.  However Kotronias found new life in the old line.  I've found his strategy to be very attractive as White using it exclusively against the Caro-Kann.  My losses have usually resulted from over-stretching myself and playing too loosely but I've had some satisfying wins.
3,0,3,g4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P2P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq g3',The start of White's exploitation of the exposed position of Black's Bishop.  White gains tempi to establish a formidable territory on the kingside.
4,0,4,Bb4,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2P1/2N5/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Better are 6...c5 and 6...f6 both of which we looked at in the post-mortem and agreed that they gave Black much better chances.
5,0,5,Ng3,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2P1/2N3N1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',?!  This is mainly the result of me mis-remembering the line (which is just the first game in Kotronias's book).  Looking quickly through the book I can only find a few examples of Ng3 being played early by White and none of them are in similar positions to this.  The objective is to prevent Black from playing ...Be4 disturbing White's KR.  However it does invite Black to disturb White's pawn structure.  Better was an immediate 7. h4 when if Black plays 7...Be4 White can play 8. Rh3 followed by Ng3 to chase off the bishop.
6,0,6,Bxc3+,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2P1/2b3N1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Another dubious move.  As Eddie said Black should play this line like a Nimzo-Indian only swapping the B for N when pushed to.  This exchange does weaken White's queenside pawns but Black fails to follow it up to exploit the weakness.  Better was 7...c5.
7,0,7,1Bd3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2nppb/2p1p2p/3pP2P/3P2P1/2PB2N1/P1P2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I usually refrain from swapping off these bishops until I have to (or it's too late!)  However on this occasion I felt that it was a good gain of tempi to swap off a B that has made one move for one in which Black has invested 3 already.  The swap would also develop my Q to a good square.
8,0,8,Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pP2P/3P2P1/2PQ2N1/P1P2P2/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black resumes his development but the pawn structure prevents him from developing his knights actively.  For this reason more active moves on the queenside were preferable such as ...c5 or ...Qb6 or ...Qa5
9,0,9,1O-O,b'r2qk2r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pP2P/3P2P1/2PQ2N1/P1P2P2/R1B2RK1 b kq -',White castles behind his far-flung pawns in order to accelerate the attack by supporting the f-pawn to advance.  With his queenside in disarray castling long was no more attractive than this and leaving the K in the centre would encourage Black to exploit the weakness on c3 sooner rather than later.  The risk of this strategy is that in attacking with his kingside pawns White over-stretches and his King is exposed to lethal fire from Queen and Rooks on the open files thus created.  Alternatively Black gets Queen and Knights behind enemy lines and wreaks havoc.
10,0,10,1Nb6,b'r2qk2r/pp2npp1/1np1p2p/3pP2P/3P2P1/2PQ2N1/P1P2P2/R1B2RK1 w kq -',This move momentarily gave me concern that the N was about to come to c4 but I soon decided that that was nothing much to worry about so I continued on my merry way.
11,0,11,1f4,b'r2qk2r/pp2npp1/1np1p2p/3pP2P/3P1PP1/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 b kq f3',! The position I had been aiming for threatening to advance the f-pawn again and open lines to Black's uncastled king.  If Black castles kingside it looks like he is walking into a pawn storm (which look more frightening than it really is if you analyse it).  Black sank into a long think ...
12,0,12,1Qd7,b'r3k2r/pp1qnpp1/1np1p2p/3pP2P/3P1PP1/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 w kq -',After this move Black had just 39 minutes left on his clock.  I had 79.  He had examined all sorts of possibilities and finally concluded that he needed to castle queenside which actually didn't help him a lot.  14...c5 was still the best move we thought after the game.
13,0,13,1f5,b'r3k2r/pp1qnpp1/1np1p2p/3pPP1P/3P2P1/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 b kq -',!? White presses on with his strategy.  Also possible were 15. Ba3 and 15. Be3 inhibiting ...c5 but inviting Black to play ...Nc4 when the bishop either has to move again or be swapped off.
14,0,14,1c5,b'r3k2r/pp1qnpp1/1n2p2p/2ppPP1P/3P2P1/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 w kq -',At last Black plays this freeing move but it's too little too late.
15,0,15,1g5,b'r3k2r/pp1qn1p1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 b kq -',White aims either to swap pawns here and thus develop the bishop to a good square or further advance to pawn to secure an outpost on f7 for his rook.  I now had 57 minutes to my opponent's 34.
16,0,16,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1qn1p1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Black relinquishes control of f7 and never recovers.  Better was ...cxd4 or ...Nc6.
17,0,17,1Rf7,b'2kr3r/pp1qnRp1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B3K1 b - -',!  White pins the N against the Q and by threatening to capture on g7 ties Black up in knots trying to defend it.
18,0,18,1Rdg8,b'2k3rr/pp1qnRp1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/2PQ2N1/P1P5/R1B3K1 w - -',?! Look at Black's pitiful rooks stuck in the corner.  I thought ...Rhg8 was better aesthetically at least though White could have responded with 19. Qh7.  Perhaps 18...c4 to push the Q off that diagonal before moving the rook to defend g7 would have been better also fixing White's weaknesses on c3 and c2 to enable a swift counter-attack with an appropriately timed ...Qa4
19,0,19,1Ba3,b'2k3rr/pp1qnRp1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/R5K1 b - -',It was finally time to do something with this bishop which was preventing my rooks from coordinating with each other.  Black wasn't about to oblige me by swapping on g5 so I decided to go the other way attacking c5 and skewering it to the N on e7.  Now 19...c4 20 Rxe7 cxd3 21. Rxd7 Kxd7 might have been interesting though 20. Qf3 would have been sounder.
20,0,20,1Qe8,b'2k1q1rr/pp2nRp1/1n2p2p/2ppP1PP/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/R5K1 w - -',Black releases the pin and tries to shoo the annoying rook away.
21,0,21,2g6,b'2k1q1rr/pp2nRp1/1n2p1Pp/2ppP2P/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/R5K1 b - -',! White improves his stranglehold.  It's not clear though how White is going to convert pressure into victory.  That N on g3 is immobilised by the pawn structure.  In the post-mortem in a similar position we looked at improving its position with Nh1-f2-g4.  However I have recent experience of similar complacent knight manoeuvres and getting punished for them.
22,0,22,2Nd7,b'2k1q1rr/pp1nnRp1/4p1Pp/2ppP2P/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/R5K1 w - -',This knight retreat defends c5 but it suggests another line of attack for White.
23,0,23,2Rb1,b'2k1q1rr/pp1nnRp1/4p1Pp/2ppP2P/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/1R4K1 b - -',!  No need to double rooks on the f-file.  Take aim directly at the King!  It was about time that I occupied this half-open file which had been unattended since move 8.
24,0,24,2Nc6,b'2k1q1rr/pp1n1Rp1/2n1p1Pp/2ppP2P/3P4/B1PQ2N1/P1P5/1R4K1 w - -',...c4 was urgently required to prevent White's next.  The attack on White's Q would have given Black time then to move the knight safely.
25,0,25,2Qb5,b'2k1q1rr/pp1n1Rp1/2n1p1Pp/1QppP2P/3P4/B1P3N1/P1P5/1R4K1 b - -',Now White has a serious direct attack going on Black's king.
26,0,26,2Nd8,b'2knq1rr/pp1n1Rp1/4p1Pp/1QppP2P/3P4/B1P3N1/P1P5/1R4K1 w - -',"I hadn't ""seen"" this but in fact it isn't much use.  While it appears to simultaneously defend b7 and attack the Rf7 it can't actually do both.  White can ignore the attack on the rook because of the mating attack on b7"
27,0,27,Kb8,b'1k1nq1rr/pp3Rp1/4p1Pp/2QpP2P/3P4/2P3N1/P1P5/1R4K1 w - -',?  The final error.  24...Nc6 would have lasted longer.
28,0,28,2Qc8#,b'k1Qnq1rr/pp3Rp1/4p1Pp/3pP2P/3P4/2P3N1/P1P5/1R4K1 b - -',Very satisfying :-)
29,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is a game where white delivers a brutal kingside attack and I made a serious blunder

33,1,4,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p1N1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq e6',White obviously cannot take the pawn or he loses the knight

55,2,2,exd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',this is a slight edge to black because he has a lead in development

Had a duel with the Master Mater I would much rather forget but I must see if I can learn something from this - the only recurring theme seems to be that I tend to get rid of my opponent's pawns only to find myself in a killer pin - ouch and double ouch!  This is the Kings Indian Defense 4 pawns attack opening which is a thematic tournament.  The non-set up moves start on move 6 where I played Nf3 which is the main line in the World DB."

You have been used to seeing Glenda in a defensive role but occasionally she can be a menace.  In this game it looked at one stage as though black had an advantage but one erroneous knight move caused Glenda to unleash her wrath on my unfortunate opponent.  How does this come about?  Well here goes.  Firstly we have a double king pawn opening and we pick up the action again on black's second move."
208,12,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. ...... d6 - this move is called the Philidor's defense.  This defense does have some bite to it - in fact I played this defense in an unrated game against a Class A Player with a rating of 1863 and beat him.  I must be very wary.
209,12,2,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3. ...... Bg4 - this move has been condemned as inferior after a game between Paul Morphy (playing white) and Count Isouard and the Duke of Brunswick - these two allies could not match the might of Paul Morphy and copped Old Matey on Move 17.
210,12,3,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',5. ........ dxe5 - over the last few moves we have had an exchange of pawns and a trade of B for N.  I now decided to put Fou Leblanc on c4.

The best square for the Witch is d6 but then he will be faced with a move such as Rad1 threatening a discovered attack on the Witch by Nf6+ which could be very nasty for black.
218,12,11,1Qd8,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/ppn5/3Np3/P1Q1P3/4B3/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',15. ...... Qd8?? - this move does not just drop the knight he is also about to drop his QR ......

He can only block the check.  Glenda can give her life for the Wicked Witch and that will then leave black a rook and a knight in arrears with counterplay virtually snuffed out.  My opponent acknowledged this and waved the white flag.  Hope you enjoyed this little brevity.

Qh4+ - I did consider taking on e5 but to do so against the Master Mater especially as he has the Wicked Witch of the West and his dsb on the board would be sheer utter folly almost crying out to be Freddied (and he will gladly oblige!).  So I figured out that the only chance of regaining my pawn would be to force a doubleton on the kingside but not with the Witch on the board.  So I saw a queen check.  Either he blocks on f2 or Freddy displaces his king and Glenda sits in his arc.  If the Witch blocks on f2 and then QxQ+ Kxf2 then surely the exchange of Fou Lenoir for that knight on e5 bears some logic especially as Freddy just lurves those horsies of his?  I then figured that I might find some way of rounding up that e5 pawn and restore parity .....

513,28,32,Rc3,b'8/5pk1/p6p/4p3/1p4PP/bRr3P1/7K/8 w - -',White resigned
514,29,0,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',It isn't usual to see the knight retreat. This was similar to the previous round where my opponent took on c6.
515,29,1,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I thought through this move long and hard. I could not take on e4 right away because of the threat of 9. Qd5! threatening checkmate while attacking the knight. A move like 9. Ba3 would be detrimental to my position and if I prevent that there is also Bg5 to be cautious of since I had lost my dark-square bishop.
516,29,2,g5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3p2/2np1n1p/4p1p1/2B1P2B/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - g6',Before playing this move I was particularly worried about 12. Bxg5 or 12. Nxg5 followed by 12... axg5 and then another recapture on g5. The white queen would then be free to come to h5 and harass my king at some point. But given the knight on f6 as well as my remaining bishop queen and rook I figured that my pieces would be able to defend from the attack.
517,29,3,Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3p2/2np3p/4p1p1/2B1n3/2P2NB1/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And then I could finally grab the pawn on e4 while attacking the bishop.
518,29,4,Bf5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/2np3p/4pbp1/2B1n3/2PQ1NB1/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',White was in for a world of pain if she didn't move her queen.
519,29,5,1fxg3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/2np3p/4pbp1/2B5/2P1QNP1/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - -',Note the open a7-g1 diagonal.
520,29,6,1Qb6,b'r4rk1/pp3p2/1qnp3p/4pbp1/2B5/2P1QNP1/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - -',I simply used this opportunity to get the queens off the table.
521,29,7,1Nxg5,b'r4rk1/1p3p2/1pnp3p/4pbN1/2B5/2P3P1/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - -',A bold move winning the g pawn and attacking both the bishop and the pawn at f7. I had high hopes for taking on c2 but I guess those hopes were dashed not that it would matter in the end anyway.
522,29,8,1Rf6,b'r4rk1/1p3p2/1pnp1Rbp/4p1N1/2B5/2P3P1/P1P3PP/R5K1 b - -',A blunder...
523,29,9,1Kg7,b'r4r2/1p3pk1/1pnp1Rbp/4p1N1/2B5/2P3P1/P1P3PP/R5K1 w - -',..now I essentially forked the knight and rook simultaneouly freeing my f7 pawn from the pin and making my king immune to an attack from her bishop.
524,29,10,Kxg6,b'r4r2/1p3p2/1pnp2kp/4p1N1/2B5/2P3P1/P1P3PP/R5K1 w - -',Note that if fxg6 the white knight would have forked at e6 giving up my material advantage.
525,29,11,2Nh3,b'r4r2/1p3p2/1pnp2kp/4p3/2B5/2P3PN/P1P3PP/R5K1 b - -',Nf3 might have been better since it wouldn't be on the edge.
526,29,12,Nxb3,b'5r2/1p3p2/1p1p2kp/4p3/8/rnP3P1/P1P2NPP/R5K1 w - -',Ironic though it was that in the opening I gave my opponent attacking potential while doubling up her pawns I ended up fixing her pawn structure for the sake of taking material off the board. This move also closed up the b file and saved my doubled b pawns from a future rook attack so it was indeed necessary.
527,29,13,Rc8,b'2r5/1p6/1p3pkp/3pp3/8/rPPN2P1/P4KPP/R7 w - -',I attacked an indefensible pawn. If Rc1 then the a pawn would fall with check. If c4 then dxc4 and white couldn't recapture with bxc4 since the knight would fall.
528,29,14,e4,b'8/1p6/1p3pkp/r7/3pp3/1PrN2P1/P2K2PP/R7 w - -',My two passed pawns become the focus of the board.
529,29,15,3Kd2,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/r4k2/3pp3/1P2r1P1/P2KN1PP/R7 b - -',Note the repetitions. I moved my rook from c3 to e3 without using a turn.
530,29,16,3Ne2,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/2r1k3/3pp3/1P2r1P1/P2KN1PP/R7 b - -',Again with the repetitions. My king and rook both moved as if a turn wasn't used. I guess White didn't have anything better to do for a defense.
531,29,17,3Ke1,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/2r1k3/3pp3/1P1r2P1/P3N1PP/R3K3 b - -',More repetitions!
532,29,18,3Ke1,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/4k3/4pN2/1Prp2P1/P1r3PP/R3K3 b - -',And yet more...
533,29,19,e3+,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/4k3/5N2/1Pr1p1P1/P2K2PP/R1r5 w - -',I gave up the passed pawn for a rook. I probably could have played better but I wouldn't be able to promote with the steadfast a1 rook guarding the first rank anyway.
534,29,20,e2+,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/8/3k1N2/1Pr2KP1/r3p1PP/8 w - -',I might as well have pawn-pushed since after 45...Rf2+ the king would escape to g4 anyway.
535,29,21,4Kf2,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/8/3k1N2/1Pr3P1/r3pKPP/8 b - -',"My opponent's last-ditch effort to stop promotion ends in a forced mate. Kg4 would be safe for not a bad period of time (depending on what you would consider ""bad""). Also Nxe2 would have helped."
536,29,22,4e1=Q+,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/8/3k1N2/1Pr3P1/r4KPP/4q3 w - -',A noble queen sacrifice. My pawn at least gets a chance to promote before the game is won.
537,29,23,Rc1#,b'8/1p6/1p3p1p/8/3k1N2/1P4P1/r5PP/2r1K3 w - -',Winning this epic game landed me a 4th place finish out of 44 in the tournament. I could not have asked for a better result since if I won in the 3rd round I probably would have lost the next two. My rating from this tournament went up 281 points more than anyone else who competed in the reserve section. In doing so well I realized my true chess potential and as a result I became more active within in my club and with chess in general. Final Score: 4-1 or 4.0/5.0. Thanks for watching!
538,30,0,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',We reach the Rubinstein Variation of the Dutch Defense although I was not aware of it at the time and simply developed as seemed natural.
539,30,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',With the Kingside for Black already so far forward I thought the potential of pinning the Knight was worth while although Black can break this at any time with h6.
540,30,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I'm not sure if a fianchetto is normal in the variation but it seems to me Black should be developing his Queenside in the hopes of castling in that direction.
541,30,3,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This move seemed odd to me as well as it blocks the c6 square for the Knight although it does allow the Queen escape room
542,30,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I totally did not see this one coming but perhaps it is normal for the variation. With the f-pawn so advanced it seems like the b3-g8 long white squared diagonal is ripe for attack
543,30,5,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4bp/2pp1np1/4ppB1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - e6',Another error I think as it pins the Knight which is Black's best piece at the moment and gives me a pawn in the exchange to follow
544,30,6,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n2bp/2p2np1/4PpB1/2P5/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The Knight on f6 is pinned and cannot move

558,30,20,hxg5,b'8/2r5/5k2/6p1/1pPKP3/1P6/6PP/2R5 w - -',My e-pawn and c-pawn passers should be enough to win at this point
559,30,21,3Rc4,b'8/2r5/4k3/2P3p1/1pRKP3/1P6/6PP/8 b - -',My opponent resigned here although I'm not sure 38. Rc4 was not worse than 38. Kc4. My connected pawns on g and h can force a trade and with my Rook behind my pawns the survivor of that exchange or my c-pawn or e-pawn will eventually Queen and my opponent resigned.
560,31,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Well this is my third attempt at writing up a game. For many years the scandinavian defense was my standard response to 1.e4 but over the past year i have been learning the Sicillian and The Hyper Accelerated Dragon is one of the most logical Sicillians and difficult for white to get a definative edge at the same time it is true it is hard to win with but given the chance black gets more than equality.
561,31,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So here goes the game starts in the standard way.
562,31,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Natural move.
563,31,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Indicating the Hyper accelerated Dragon. Black does not play d6 as if allowed will try to play d5 in one go and not lose the tempo.
564,31,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This has to be the best move and has been seen in thousands of games.
565,31,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Naturally
566,31,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',There are many sidelines. Qxd4 is possible and playable as is c3.
567,31,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black challenges White for control of the central squares
568,31,8,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',The Moroxcy Bind. One of the reasons why many Sicillian players stopped playing this line but the bind can be broken and the counterplay is available with the breaks a6 and b5 and in some lines just b5 on its own. I am actually very happy about playing against it because the play is slower and more manoevering rather than bang and crash tactics.
569,31,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Hitting the e4 pawn hoping for e4-e5 When Qa5+ wins the pawn

571,31,11,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Sadly in this line i have to play d6 now. With the bind in place i have to give up my dreams of playing d5 in one go but now i am going to start counter attacking.
572,31,12,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Bishop e3 would have been met by Knight g4 so fairly natural to prevent that.
573,31,13,Nxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PnP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The Knight on d4 is a vital piece for White and now White starts to go wrong.

576,31,16,Qd1,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This move was definately wrong. Best was Bishop e3 as the bishop on g7 is not defended yet so did not have to worry yet about me moving my knight. The follow up would have been Queen d2 ready to force the way to h6.
577,31,17,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Natural development

609,33,0,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',I thought we were heading to a four pawns game which OldGus just finished a mini-tournament.

619,33,10,1Nxb4,b'1r1q1rk1/2p2pbp/bp1ppnp1/8/1nPPPP2/2NBB3/5NPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I decided to act boldly
620,33,11,1Ra4,b'1r1q1rk1/2p2pbp/bp1ppnp1/8/RnPPPP2/2NBB3/5NPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',15. Rxa6 Nxa6 and some of the tension is released
621,33,12,Qxa8,b'q4rk1/2p2pbp/1p1ppnp1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/5BPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',I ended up a pawn up after the smoke cleared and but my position is still cramped and my pieces are not in play for the most part

627,33,18,Ra8,b'r5k1/1q3pnp/1p2p1pb/2P5/5P2/1QN3P1/R4B1P/6K1 w - -',I'm hoping for a Rook trade and then to somehow blockade the b-pawn after cxb6 but it is hopeless at this stage
628,33,19,Rxb7,b'6k1/1r3pnp/4p1pb/2P5/5P2/2N3P1/R4B1P/6K1 w - -',Now I lose material and the c-pawn is all but unstoppable

I didn't take advantage of my Queen's excellent position to force the game on my opponent and then my undeveloped pieces could not come to my aid when White moved into an attacking position.
630,34,0,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This game is from a tourney from the Knights of Honor club here at gameknot (we're always looking for new members to the club so feel free to stop by and take a look at the club forum).  White begins with d3 known as the Mieses opening (I had to look that up as I've never seen that opening).  
631,34,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I go with my typical defense as Black The Modern/Robatsch Defense.
632,34,2,d6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/8/3P2P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Thus far pretty typical moves for Black.
633,34,3,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/2P5/3P2P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq c6',As Black in The Modern I often go 4...a6 to set up b5 and queenside expansion.  However when White strikes out early with c4 a6 doesn't make much sense.  Therefore I mirror White.
634,34,4,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2npp1p1/2p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I wanted the option to develop my N to either f6 or e7 and therefore moved 6...e6.
635,34,5,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2npp1p1/2p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',7.  Nge7--I think I was trying to reinforce control over f5 d5--particulary as it was possible that I'd move e5 to free up Bc8.
636,34,6,h6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2npb1/2npp1pp/2p3B1/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The question is put immediately to white.  If White had exchanged B for N I would have attempted to open up the board to capitalize on the B-pair--perhaps d5.
637,34,7,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp2npb1/2npp1pp/2p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White retreats.
638,34,8,Kh7,b'r1bq1r2/pp2npbk/2npp1pp/2p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R1Q2RK1 w - -',Protecting h6.

640,34,10,e5,b'r1bq1r2/pp2n1bk/2np2pp/2p1pp2/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R1Q2RK1 w - -',12...e5  I think with this move I was seeking to gain space on the King side.  It leaves a hole at d5 but Ne7 covered it and I had plans for Be6.
641,34,11,1Qa4,b'1r1q1r2/pp2n1bk/2npb1pp/2p1pp2/Q1P5/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',15.  Qa4  Looked to me that White had queenside designs (positional chess is not my strength but is something I'm working on).
642,34,12,1Qb6,b'1r3r2/pp2n1bk/1qnpb1pp/2p1pp2/Q1P5/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',I figured the Black Queen wasn't doing much on d8 and this could disrupt White's q-side designs.
643,34,13,1b3,b'1r3r2/pp2n1bk/1qnpb1pp/2p1pp2/Q1P5/1PNP1NP1/P2BPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',I was unclear why 16. b3.  I certainly did not plan on taking b3 with my Queen.
644,34,14,1Rf7,b'1r6/pp2nrbk/1qnpb1pp/2p1pp2/Q1P5/1PNP1NP1/P2BPPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',I can't recall my exact reason for this except perhaps to line the Black rooks up on the f-file.
645,34,15,1Nd5,b'1r6/pp2nrbk/1qnpb1pp/2pNpp2/Q1P5/1P1P1NP1/P2BPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',17. Nd5--I did not understand this move as it loses a pawn.
646,34,16,1Qh4,b'1r6/pp3rbk/1qnp2pp/2pbpp2/7Q/1P1P1NP1/P2BPPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',19. Qd4  This move initially concerned me as all I saw was White's Q and DSB bearing down on h6 and White's N ready to jump in and fork Black's K and R.  After a bit I was able to develop a plan.  (as an aside in my post game review with Fritz it recommended 19. Ng5+  hxg5 20. Bxd5  This would have changed the game quite a bit as Black would have had to move Rf7 to c7 to avoid being taken and to protect Nc6.)
647,34,17,Qd8,b'1r1q4/pp3rbk/2np2pp/2p1pp2/7Q/1P1P1BP1/P2BPP1P/2R2RK1 w - -',20...Qd8 In hindsight I came to believe that this was an error on Black's part.  My thought was to chase White's Q away or exchange Q's and try to get to an endgame with the pawn advantage.  However I believe that 20...Nd4 would have been a better move.  When discussing this with my opponent (after move 20) he indicated had I gone 20...Nd4 he would have moved 21. Kf2 likely to avoid the potential fork.  From Nd4 Black could have exchanged the N for White's LSB thereby eliminating White's B-pair.  As will be seen Black had to give back his pawn advantage to break up that pair.
648,34,18,2Bd5,b'4r3/ppr3bk/2np2pp/2pBpp2/4P3/1P1P1PP1/P2B3P/2R2RK1 b - -',This Bishop does not move again and is a bone in Black's throat for the rest of the game.  Again move 20...Nd4 and this is not a concern.
649,34,19,2Nd4,b'4r3/ppr3bk/3p2pp/2pBpp2/3nP3/1P1P1PP1/P2B3P/2R2RK1 w - -',The obvious threat is Ne2.  The hope was that White would seek to exchange B for N.
650,34,20,3h4,b'8/p1r1r1bk/1p1p2pp/2pBpp2/3nP2P/1P1PBPP1/P5K1/2R2R2 b - h3',30. h4.  At this point I became quite concerned.  White has both Bishops bearing down on the Black King's position.  White is rolling his pawns down toward the Black King and if they open up the position White's rooks will easily get to the King.  Essentially my view was that Black had a material advantage (1 pawn) but White had a significant positional advantage.  However Black saw a way to give back the pawn and impact White's positional advantage.
651,34,21,3Kxf4,b'8/p1r1r1bk/1p1p2pp/2pB4/4PK1P/1P1P1P2/P1R5/5R2 b - -', 
652,34,22,Bd4,b'8/p1r3rk/1p1p2pp/2pB4/3bPPKP/1P1P4/P1R5/5R2 w - -',And white's positional advantage has been pretty significantly minimized.  
653,34,23,b5,b'8/p1r3rk/3p2pp/1ppB4/3bPPKP/PP1P4/2R5/5R2 w - -',At this point I did not see how I could break thru White's defenses unless he made an error.  I sought to simply stop any incursion.
654,34,24,4Rc1,b'8/4r1r1/3p2pk/p1pB3p/Pp1bPP1P/1P1P3K/6R1/2R5 b - -',It was here I suggested the draw to White but did not offer it.  I could see no way through and no way the White could break through.  However I did not formally offer the draw as I am 200 pts south of my opponent's rating and it was quite possible he saw something I did not.
655,34,25,4Kh2,b'8/2r3r1/3p2pk/p1pB3p/Pp1bPP1P/1P1P4/6RK/2R5 b - -',Here he agreed with my assessment offered the draw and I accepted.  This represents my first draw against a 1900+ opponent.  I don't know that either player made a large error--rather a few smaller errors.  I enjoyed the game and it was a pleasure playing against paolo.  I welcome any comments.
656,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I may have posted this result in the general forums in fact this game came fourth place out of ten participants in the Coaching Club's January Game of the Month's competition.  I will now annotate it as I am currently playing the Master Mater as white in the KID Four Pawns Attack competition and as I already lost to him as black I need some kinda ego boost here to remind myself that I do not always lose to Masters.  This game is the Ruy Lopez."
657,35,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3. ....... Nf6 - normally a6 is played here but this move is pretty good.
658,35,2,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',5. d4 - if d6?? then d5 wins the c6 knight.
659,35,3,Bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2Bn4/4p3/3P4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',7. Bxc6 - a kind of delayed exchange variation.
660,35,4,Qe4,b'r1bqk2r/p1ppbppp/2p5/4Pn2/4Q3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',9. Qe4 - Glenda takes an aggressive stance but can she maintain it?

662,35,6,1Nc3,b'r1bqr1k1/p1ppbp1p/2p3pB/4P3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',13. Nc3 - now out comes the knight and now my rooks are connected.
663,35,7,1Qxc6,b'r1bqr1k1/p4p1p/2Qp1bpB/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',16. Qxc6 - I am still in the database but playing through the moves this looks good as I am a clear pawn up and black's queenside pawns (only 2 of them) are scattered so I have no reason to deviate at this point.
664,35,8,1Qf3,b'1r1qr1k1/p2b1p1p/3p2p1/4b3/5B2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',19. Qf3 - Glenda is driven to a defensive square but not for long.  My pawn on b2 drops but there now follows a plethora of exchanges.
665,35,9,2Rd1,b'3q2k1/p2b1p1p/6p1/4p3/8/2N2Q2/PrP2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',22. Rd1 - this moves pins Maria's light square bishop to the Wicked Witch of the West (yup that is my nickname for the enemy queen - she really can be very wicked!)
666,35,10,2h3,b'3q4/p2b1pkp/6p1/4p3/8/2N2Q1P/PrP2PP1/3R2K1 b - -',23. h3 - this is also a database move but I think it is very sensible to create a flight square for Henry especially if I wish to do some attacking in Maria's arc.
667,35,11,2Qxa7,b'8/Q2b1pkp/4q1p1/3Np3/8/7P/P1r2PP1/3R2K1 b - -',26. Qxa7 - this gives me a passer on the a column.  Sadly I find myself unable to hold on to this pawn.  If I could have done so then I may well have been talking about a Master Victory here.
668,35,12,Re2,b'8/3b1pkp/4q1p1/3Np3/8/Q6P/P3rPP1/3R2K1 w - -',27. ....... Re2 - we are finally in open play and this black rook does not want to leave my second rank if he can help it.  I just wanna get rid of it.
669,35,13,3Nxd1,b'8/3b1pkp/4q1p1/4p3/8/Q6P/P4PP1/3N2K1 b - -',31. Nxd1 - I get my wish but .....
670,35,14,Qd4,b'8/3b1pk1/6p1/4p2p/3q4/1QN4P/P4PP1/6K1 w - -',33. ...... Qxd4 - declining my invitation to trade queens.
671,35,15,3a4,b'8/3b1pk1/6p1/4p2p/P2q4/1QN4P/5PP1/6K1 b - a3',34. a4? - Too much too soon as Maria will show me.
672,35,16,Bxa4,b'8/5pk1/6p1/4p2p/b7/1QN1qP1P/6PK/8 w - -',36. ....... Bxa4! - aaargh!  Although the a4 pawn was twice defended I repeat twice defended I found it was not defended at all.  The c3 knight is pinned against Glenda.  If Glenda takes on a4 then my c3 knight falls.  I decided to take on a4 because a Q & P ending with pawns on one side of the board looks drawish.  It is one thing to think of an ending as theoretically drawn however another to proove it.
673,35,17,3Qe8,b'4Q3/5pk1/6p1/4p2p/8/2q2P1P/6PK/8 b - -',38. Qe8 - Glenda gets behind the majority pawn which could become passed.  Here is the maxim when in a rook or queen ending always get your heavy piece behind the passed enemy pawn.  Also there is the possibility here that if Maria advances her pawns at an innopportune moment then Glenda can check her king to kingdom come!
674,35,18,4Qe8,b'4Q3/5pk1/6p1/4p3/7p/5P1P/6PK/4q3 b - -',40. Qe8 - hang on in there Glenda!
675,35,19,4Qe7+,b'8/4Qp2/6p1/4p1k1/5q1p/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',44. Qe7+ - Glenda keeps her glare on the black king.
676,35,20,4f6,b'8/4Q3/5pp1/4p1k1/5q1p/5P1P/6P1/6K1 w - -',44. ...... f6 - this means that if Maria wishes to play out the 50 move rule I must wait until move 94 (assuming no further pawn movement or capture on either side) to claim a draw by the 50 move rule.
677,35,21,4Qe8,b'4Q3/8/5pp1/4p1k1/1q5p/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',47. Qe8 - still Glenda refuses to budge from the a column.
678,35,22,4Kg1,b'4Q3/8/5pp1/4p1k1/5q1p/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',48. Kg1 - a few moves back Maria declined a draw offer as she is nearly 500 points north of my rating I can't say I blame her for wanting to test out my stamina!
679,35,23,5Kh1,b'4Q3/2q5/5pp1/4p1k1/7p/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',50. Kh1 - Henry moves off a discovery line.  I cannot allow a passed pawn on that e column if I can help it.
680,35,24,5Kh2,b'4Q3/8/5pp1/2q1pk2/7p/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',52. Kh2 - Henry takes refuge on h2 again.
681,35,25,5Qd7+,b'8/3Q4/5pp1/4pk2/2q4p/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',53. Qd7+ - Glenda keeps the BK busy when she can.
682,35,26,5Qe6,b'8/8/4Qpp1/4p1k1/7p/5P1P/3q2PK/8 b - -',56. Qe6 - Glenda is enjoying attacking rather than defending - I do put upon that poor gal sometimes!  Here she is threatening Qg4+.
683,35,27,f5,b'4Q3/8/3q2p1/4ppk1/7p/5P1P/6P1/7K w - -',58. ....... f5 - another pawn moves this means I must now survive until move 108.  Quite frankly this is the longest game I have had against any Master so this is an enormous ask!
684,35,28,5Qa4,b'8/8/3q2p1/4ppk1/Q6p/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',59. Qa4 - although coming off the e column Glenda is still trying to hold up the advance of the e4 pawn.
685,35,29,6Kh2,b'8/8/4Q1p1/4ppk1/7p/5P1P/6PK/2q5 b - -',62. Kh2 - again another familiar king move.
686,35,30,Qe3+,b'8/8/4Q1p1/4ppk1/7p/4qP1P/6P1/6K1 w - -',63. ....... Qe3+ and DRAW OFFER!  I was just contemplating another move to h2 when just as I started my coffee break at work I saw the words Draw Offer.  Whew all I have to do is click on the Yes button click proceed and I can now celebrate my first ever Master Draw - I have a senior colleague who is also a chess player at work boy was I not chuffed to share this particular news with her that I had achieved my first ever Master Draw after 33 years of playing chess (I started at the age of 10).  Now I have this mantra - I do not always lose to Masters!  - Although as you have seen I got stuffed by Maria in the return leg I just hope I can now add to that tally of 1 Master Draw and 8 Expert Draws surely it can be a matter of time ...... watch this space .......

687,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I've annotated a few of my Chinese Dragon outings already and this one will be the last one I think. The Dragon isn't in my regular repertoire but after this experience I might give it a future look my results with it were quite satisfactory. And on the whole the defense isn't really a defense it's more of a full-blown attack with Black.
688,36,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The Dragon got its name after Black's K-side pawn structure which resembles the tail of a dragon. It's only suiting that the people which first introduced the legendary beast into their folklore get to attach their country's name to a line of the defense.
689,36,2,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',9. 0-0-0 is the reason why I'm hesitant to play this opening as Black. It has overshadowed the old main line the Yugoslav attack in modern practice and for good reason. White has several promising lines in which he can put the squeeze on Black's position without allowing the standard counter-play. But I digress.
690,36,3,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',The move that gave new life to the Dragon in the Yugoslav attack. The first serious analysis published on it was done by Luc Henris although the move itself is much older than that but it wasn't very prominent until Black players started to have serious problems in the more analyzed lines with 10...Rc8 and 10...Qa5.
691,36,4,1Bb3,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',The most elastic move by White and so far considered the best theoretical reply.
692,36,5,1Na5,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/n7/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',11...Ne5 is also an option but is just a little bit slower. Also it's a less secure square since after a possible immediate f4 push by White Nc4 isn't possible.
693,36,6,1Bh6,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1npB/n7/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',Perhaps 12. Kb1 was safer. White makes no defensive moves and goes on pure offense.
694,36,7,1Bxh6,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1bpp1p/3p1npb/n7/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Without h4 having been played this is a very good reply. White still needs a few more moves to get the attack going.
695,36,8,b5,b'1r1q1rk1/p2bpp1p/3p1npQ/np6/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - b6',But so does Black. This is the point behind Black's tenth move. The c-file is a little less useful for the attack than the b-file. Combined with a possible pawn on c4 White will have more trouble defending b2 compared to c2. The drawback is that it takes more time to execute this plan as opposed to the standard plan in the classical main lines.
696,36,9,1h4,b'1r1q1rk1/p2bpp1p/3p1npQ/np6/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - h3',Going for the h-file. Very straightforward play by White.
697,36,10,1b4,b'1r1q1rk1/p2bpp1p/3p1npQ/n7/1p1NP2P/1BN2P2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',But not necessarily best. I missed a much better course of action that started with the move 14...e5. After 15. Nde2 Nxb3+ 16. axb3 b4 17. Nd5 Nxd5 18. Rxd5 Be6 19. h5 Qc7 20. Rd3 Rfc8 and White's attack has stalled and Black's just about to start. The move I played gives about equal chances.
698,36,11,e5,b'1r1q1rk1/p2b1p1p/3p1npQ/n2Np3/1p1NP2P/1B3P2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - e6',Less effective now as demonstrated by White's next.
699,36,12,Nxd5,b'1r1q1rk1/p4p1p/3p2pQ/3npP2/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3P1/2KR3R w - -',After 19. Rxd5 the position is about equal. White has some pressure against my King but I can defend quite well. Instead White got attacking ideas and played more daringly. Much to my surprise and delight.
700,36,13,1fxg6,b'1r1q1rk1/p4p1p/3p2PQ/3np3/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3P1/2KR3R b - -',Hold on what's this? You didn't want my Knight?
701,36,14,1Nf6,b'1r1q1rk1/p4p1p/3p1nPQ/4p3/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3P1/2KR3R w - -',I guess I'll retreat it now.
702,36,15,2Rh3,b'1r1q1r1k/p4p1P/3p1n1Q/4p3/1p5P/1P3P1R/1PP3P1/2KR4 b - -',White has some compensation but it's clearly not enough.
703,36,16,Qa5,b'1r3r1k/p4p1n/3R3Q/q3p3/1p5P/1P3P1R/1PP3P1/2K5 w - -',White has two pawns for the minus piece and a shadow of an attack. I still need to be careful. Luckily White's King isn't sleeping in a bed of roses.
704,36,17,2Rf6,b'1r4rk/p4p1n/5R1Q/q3p3/1p5P/1P3P1R/1PP3P1/1K6 b - -',24. g4 looks like more sturdy. I guess White only has eyes for my King.
705,36,18,2Rxg2,b'1r5k/p4p1n/5R1Q/q3p3/1p5P/1P3P1R/1PP3r1/1K6 w - -',All of a sudden it's White who's under attack. A simple back-rank mate is threatened.
706,36,19,Rbg8,b'6rk/p4p1n/5R1Q/q3p3/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3r1/1K5R w - -',Continuing with the threat.
707,36,20,Qd5,b'6rk/p4p1n/5R1Q/3qp3/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3r1/1KR5 w - -',I have to admit I love a central Queen. It's just such a fitting place for such a powerful piece. 
708,36,21,2Rf5,b'6rk/p4p1n/7Q/3qpR2/1p5P/1P3P2/1PP3r1/1KR5 b - -',Trying to play 28. Rh5
709,36,22,2Rxc2,b'6rk/p4p1n/7Q/3qpR2/1p5P/1P3P2/1Pr5/1KR5 w - -',But there is no more time for that. The Rook on f5 is loose and I should pick it up after this sacrifice.
710,36,23,3Rc2,b'2r4k/p4p1n/7Q/4pR2/1p5P/1P1q1P2/1PR5/1K6 b - -',30. Ka2 was the slow way to die. 
711,36,24,3Rh5,b'7k/p4p1n/7Q/4p2R/1p5P/1P1q1P2/1Pr5/1K6 b - -',White gets the tempo to play his intended move.
712,36,25,3Rc5+,b'7k/p4p1n/7Q/2r1p2R/1p5P/1P1q1P2/1P6/1K6 w - -',But I have mate in two. White resigned.
713,37,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Undeterred by recent experiences I persevered with an Indian defence though which flavour I hadn't yet decided.
714,37,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',First decision point: I decided to stay on familiar ground even though I'm now convinced that the Nimzo-Indian is a much sounder defence.  As yet I'm not sufficiently familiar with the Queen's Indian and Bogo-Indian to risk ending up in one of those so I stuck with the King's Indian.
715,37,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The next decision point: I could have gone for the Grunfeld with 3...d5 but I only really know one line of that and it doesn't usually work out for me to well.
716,37,3,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',An unusual move indicating that White is probably avoiding the well-trodden lines after 4. e4.
717,37,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Since White had not yet played e4 I decided that I could defer the decision on how to structure my pawns and castled immediately expecting White to reply with 5. Bg5.
718,37,5,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I felt quite smug seeing this.  It's not often I can accurately predict my opponent's moves!
719,37,6,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppb1/5npp/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',I'm usually suspicious of playing ...h6 to push a bishop away since the pawn can become a target after Be3 and Qd2; but in this position I felt that I should put the question to the B while my N was still unpinned planning to defend the h-pawn with my King if necessary.
720,37,7,Bh4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppb1/5npp/8/2PP3B/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',The first surprise and quite a pleasant one: the h6 pawn is unlikely now to become a target.  On the other hand the B is still aimed at my Q so I need to be careful how and when I move my e-pawn and Nf6.
721,37,8,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The standard KID move preparing either ...c5 or ...e5
722,37,9,e3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',As predicted.
723,37,10,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',?! Played after some thought but probably wrong.  In the KID Black is usually OK playing ...e5 without fully supporting it but not in this position with the B on h4.  Thus the motivation was to support ...e5 with this N.  I didn't want to develop it to the more aggressive-looking c6 because it could be immediately pushed away with d5.  Now in many variations of the KID Black tries hard to provoke White into that advance solidifying the centre so that Black can work around the edges but I couldn't see a suitable home for the N after 7...Nc6 8. e5.  Black's other possible N development is via a6 which again doesn't directly support ...e5 but does lay claim to b4 and c5 while leaving Black's lsb scope for development.  In this game my lsb doesn't get to move till move 18 something that preyed on my mind throughout the intervening period.  I could have deferred decisions on the N's development by making a pawn move such as ...c6 or ...c5 ...b6 or ...a6 or ...a5.  7...g5 was considered briefly but I felt it was too risky: White could swap B or N for 2 pawns and then use the half-open files to launch a withering attack on my K.
724,37,11,Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',A sensible move possibly preparing 0-0-0 possibly just Rd1.  With the Black N on d7 there is no risk of it coming soon to b4 to harrass the Q.
725,37,12,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',With White's pawn still on d4 his N could still occupy d5.  I'd seen in my game against Paxton-Doggett how devastating that could be so I decided to prevent it while I still had time to especially if I managed to get ...e5 in.
726,37,13,Be2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White is playing simple flexible developing moves.  I'd expected 9. 0-0-0 or 9. Bd3 targeting the weakened g6 pawn but this looks perfectly sensible and prepares 0-0 as well.
727,37,14,Qe8,b'r1b1qrk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I decided to get the Q off the d8-h4 diagonal before launching the e-pawn.  The main drawback that I could see was that after 0-0 White could oppose the Q with Re1 making it risky to advance the e-pawn and provoke multiple exchanges.
728,37,15,e5,b'r1b1qrk1/pp1n1pb1/2pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - e6',After all that preparation I finally play the thematic advance.
729,37,16,1Rad1,b'r1b1qrk1/pp1n1pb1/2pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',!  I found the long-term threats posed by the Rook very troubling.  White gained about ten minutes clock time on me around here.
730,37,17,1a6,b'r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Played in anticipation of needing to advance the c-pawn and not wanting to allow Nb5 attacking the then-undefended d6 pawn.
731,37,18,1dxe5,b'r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pp1npp/4P3/2P4B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',But White's response makes that concern irrelevant as the d-pawn now becomes the e-pawn leaving a raking open file for White's rook.
732,37,19,1Nd2,b'r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p2npp/4p3/2P4B/2N1P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White prevents the pawn's further advance and possibly prepares an advance by his f-pawn.  I could also see that the N was probably aiming to go via e4 to d6 which looked like a nuisance but I felt I could live with it.
733,37,20,1Rb8,b'1rb1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p2npp/4p3/2P4B/2N1P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',A bit of a waiting move with ideas of possibly advancing the b-pawn and developing the lsb to b7
734,37,21,1Nce4,b'1rb1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p2npp/4p3/2P1N2B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Not the N I'd expected to move there but perfectly logical.
735,37,22,1Qe6,b'1rb2rk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p1qnpp/4p3/2P1N2B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I wanted to move the Nd7 so I needed to over-protect the Nf6.  I could also have solved that problem by swapping on e4 which might have freed me up a bit but I didn't think it would help me prevent an eventual Nd6 by the replacement N.
736,37,23,1c5,b'1rb2rk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p1qnpp/2P1p3/4N2B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Played quickly.  Now I thought long and hard about how I was going to deal with the N that was sure to come to d6 now.  Eventually I decided that I could just live with it and play around it.  If White wanted to swap his good N for my bad B so be it.  Otherwise I just needed to avoid the white squares with my Rooks and keep my Q next to d6.  So then it was a question of seeing what else I could do and I noticed that the pawn move had given me the d5 square so...
737,37,24,1Nd5,b'1rb2rk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p1q1pp/2Pnp3/4N2B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',! Now I could see relief from my cramped position.  I could advance the f-pawn move my other N and finally move my lsb.  I could also budge his Q if I liked with ..Nb4.
738,37,25,1Nd6,b'1rb2rk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pNq1pp/2Pnp3/7B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White returned about ten minutes on the clock with this move
739,37,26,1b5,b'1rb2rk1/3n1pb1/p1pNq1pp/1pPnp3/7B/4P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 w - b6',! Black chooses the moment when taking en passant is not feasible because it would leave the Nd6 undefended.  This now prevents White from pinning the Nd5 against Black's Q with Bc4.
740,37,27,1Nb3,b'1rb2rk1/3n1pb1/p1pNq1pp/1pPnp3/7B/1N2P3/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',! Unexpected but strong aiming for a5 whence it will threaten c6 and thence b8.  Once more White's R dominates the d-file.
741,37,28,1Nd7f6,b'1rb2rk1/5pb1/p1pNqnpp/1pPnp3/7B/1N2P3/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I felt it was too early to play ...f5 which is very loosening.
742,37,29,1a3,b'1rb2rk1/5pb1/p1pNqnpp/1pPnp3/7B/PN2P3/1PQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',A waiting move by White with the added bonus that it prevents ...Nb4.
743,37,30,1Bd7,b'1r3rk1/3b1pb1/p1pNqnpp/1pPnp3/7B/PN2P3/1PQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',finally...
744,37,31,1h3,b'1r3rk1/3b1pb1/p1pNqnpp/1pPnp3/7B/PN2P2P/1PQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',Another waiting move.  White explained after the game that he was suddenly worried by the possibility of Nf6 moves followed by ...f5 and ...g5 and ...f4 trapping the Bh4.  I have to confess that I hadn't really considered this.  I was still trying to unravel my pieces and not yet thinking about the typical KID kingside pawn avalanche (see move 17).  With all this worrying White had now used up nearly 20 minutes more than me on the clock and ours was the least advanced game in progress.
745,37,32,1Ne8,b'1r2nrk1/3b1pb1/p1pNq1pp/1pPnp3/7B/PN2P2P/1PQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Now I was considering trying to gain a pawn with 20...Nxd6 21. cxd6 Qxd6 but soon rejected that idea because of 22. e4! pinning the N against my Q.  However I could also see other advantages of this retreat such as once more allowing ...f5 and possibly tempting White to swap on e8
746,37,33,2e4,b'1r2nrk1/3b1pb1/p1pNq1pp/1pPnp3/4P2B/PN5P/1PQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',A surprise.  I thought White would encourage me to blunder before advancing this pawn!  It is good though.
747,37,34,2Ndf6,b'1r2nrk1/3b1pb1/p1pNqnpp/1pP1p3/4P2B/PN5P/1PQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Now my position is clogging up again.
748,37,35,f5,b'1r2nrk1/3b2b1/p1p1q1pp/1pP1pp2/4P1BB/PN5P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - f6',The only move to save my Q trapped as it was in the centre of the board.
749,37,36,gxf5,b'1r2nrk1/3b2b1/p1p1q2p/1pP1pp2/6BB/PN5P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Now Black has hanging pawns and three pawn islands a strategic weakness in a game of attrition but the pawns are mobile and pushing White back for now.
750,37,37,2Bh5,b'1r2nrk1/3b2b1/p1p1q2p/1pP1pp1B/7B/PN5P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',! Or so I thought.  White's Bishops may be on the rim but they dominate Black's centre and back row preventing him from coordinating his rooks properly.  Over the next 22 moves White regains his time on the clock and Black achieves precisely nothing!  The position of these Bishops reminds me of one of Anderssen's great games - The Immortal Game?
751,37,38,2Rb7,b'4nrk1/1r1b2b1/p1p1q2p/1pP1pp1B/7B/PN5P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',A desultory attempt to improve this rook hoping eventually to double somewhere if I could do anything about White's pesky prelates.
752,37,39,2Na5,b'4nrk1/1r1b2b1/p1p1q2p/NpP1pp1B/7B/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',The predicted response from White.  I was hoping that this N would become hors de combat over here.
753,37,40,2Bd8,b'3Bnrk1/2rb2b1/p1p1q2p/NpP1pp1B/8/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',! I hadn't expected this though.  Now my rook will have taken three moves to do what it could have accomplished in one.
754,37,41,e4,b'2r1nrk1/3b2b1/pBp1q2p/NpP2p1B/4p3/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Fnally something more constructive from Black though I had my doubts about releasing control of f4.  These were outweighed by the perception that White's dsb was now offside on b6 and that my Bg7 could finally have some freedom and influence on the game.  In a few more moves this pawn might be able to fork White's Rooks!
755,37,42,2Bxe8,b'2r1Brk1/3b2b1/pBp1q2p/NpP2p2/4p3/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',I had long been expecting this as preparation for White to occupy d6 with his Rook.  In the cold light of day it does look odd though to give up this active B for Black's enfeebled N.
756,37,43,Rb8,b'1r2brk1/1N4b1/pBp1q2p/1pP2p2/4p3/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',The rook returns where it was 6 moves ago.  The main purpose of this move was to make 30. Nd6 less dangerous.
757,37,44,3Nd8,b'1r1Nbrk1/6b1/pBp1q2p/1pP2p2/4p3/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',Another mysterious move to my back rank.  Clearly my Q has to move but I could see no ulterior motive so...
758,37,45,3Qe5,b'1r1Nbrk1/6b1/pBp4p/1pP1qp2/4p3/P6P/1PQ2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Now I was starting to feel that I might get some real counter-play
759,37,46,3b4,b'1r1Nbrk1/6b1/pBp4p/1pP1qp2/1P2p3/P6P/2Q2PP1/3R1RK1 b - b3',The threatened pawn completes the chain.
760,37,47,3Qc3,b'1r1Nbrk1/6b1/pBp4p/1pP2p2/1P2p3/P1q4P/2Q2PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Now I swap off my newly active Q: seems illogical but I couldn't see anything better at the time.  Afterwards Dave suggested 31...Qb2 when Black can hope to hoover up the pawn chain but risks getting his B trapped.  I hadn't considered it at this point but did consider and reject that strategy soon after.
761,37,48,Rf6,b'1r1Nb1k1/8/pBpR1r1p/1pP2p2/1P2p3/P1b4P/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',The only move to protect both c6 and h6 at once.

768,37,55,Bb2,b'2rBb3/5rk1/p1pR3p/NpP2p2/1P2p3/P6P/1b3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',A gesture against the a-pawn but I didn't expect to be able to take it and get away with it because of Rb1 Rdd1 and Rb3
769,37,56,Be5,b'2rBb3/5rk1/p1pR3p/NpP1bp2/1P2p3/P6P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Better to recentralise and harass the advanced rook.
770,37,57,Rd7,b'2rBb3/3r2k1/p1p4p/NpP1bp2/1P2p3/P6P/5PP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Now Black starts to push White back.  I got over-confident now.

772,37,59,Ke5,b'2r1b3/8/p1p4p/NpP1kp2/1P6/P2R3P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',Both our flags were hanging now and it was clear that I was either going to lose on time or over the board.  I recorded the next few moves but stopped recording at move 46 when it was all but over.  I resigned a few moves later just before my flag fell.
773,37,60,Rg8,b'6r1/8/p1pN2bp/1pP1kp2/1P6/P2R3P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',The last recorded move on my scoresheet.  I didn't bother getting Dave's more up to date sheet.  Suffice to say that Dave retained control of the d-file preventing my K from penetrating the queenside mopped up one of the loose kingside pawns and prepared to march his own kingside pawns to promotion.
774,38,0,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Standard stuff. I have recently shown preference to either the Nimzo or the Bogo Indian which have very similar plans. I used to prefer c5 to intiate the Benko Gambit which is exciting to play but these lines are safer against stronger players
775,38,1,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Seems natural to chuck in the check to gain a tempo
776,38,2,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/6P1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',So i have reached a Bogo Indian position and white has not got Knight f3 in so if i am right i am a tempo up.
777,38,3,Ne4,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n1p3/8/2PPn3/2B2NP1/PP2PP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',The point of course now is to remove this bishop and Black has no problems whatsoever and equality is achieved.

781,38,7,1d6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2npp3/8/2PP4/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The idea is now to play e5 and if d5 then we have transposed into a Nimzo of sorts without the usual counterplay for white as his bishop on g2 will be blocked in.
782,38,8,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np4/4p3/2PP4/2PQ2P1/P2NPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',Preparing perhaps to go to e4? I do not really agree with this one. I think he had to play d5 or e4 straight away as this wastes time and allows me to play......
783,38,9,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4pp2/2PP4/2PQ2P1/P2NPPBP/R4RK1 w - f6',Now i am trying to control e4 to prevent his knight going there.

I would keep my bishop on this diagonal and combined with the rook be able to take all the other pawns without ever allowing his rook back into the game.

I do not think i won this game. Rather my opponent went on self destruct!"

Again nothing remarkable: just a few errors and an inevitable decline.  The Fast Ladder has exposed me to many more good players who simply milk me for the wins necessary to keep them at the top of the table.  The last time I played dawnjones he strangled me to death. This time is less extreme.
809,39,1,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I have a book on the Bb5 Sicilian by Richard Palliser.  I've never read it though: maybe I should.  This is the Moscow Variation.
810,39,2,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This seems to me to be the most robust response and according to Palliser remains the main defence.

815,39,7,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/2p1p3/P3P3/2NP1N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black concentrates on his King's safety allowing White to play the threatened advance.

817,39,9,1Ra2,b'r4rk1/2q1bppp/pn1p1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/RPPBQPPP/5RK1 b - -',Now White threatens to double on the half-open a-file.  White is playing simple logical chess forcing Black to respond. Eventually Black will crack and White win.

822,39,14,2Qe6,b'r5k1/r2n1pp1/p3qb1p/2pN1Q2/4P3/1P1P3P/R1PB1PP1/R5K1 w - -',Black covers e7 and offers to swap Queens: not very good when 2 pawns down.

826,39,18,2Nb8,b'rn4k1/r5p1/p3p2p/2p5/1P2P3/3PB2P/R1P2PP1/R5K1 w - -',Black gives up the c-pawn over-defending the a-pawn so that the Ra7 can move when attacked.
