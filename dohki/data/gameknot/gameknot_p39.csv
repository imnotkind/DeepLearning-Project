0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Mary also open with this.  The idea being is that like me she was also taught this opening by Jack.
1,0,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',?! This is the first move where I corrected but I didn't tell her it was a mistake or blunder.  Instead I said more common was 2.Nf3 for the Open Sicilian.  The reason I told her that was because first after seeing how she played last week I think she's ready to learn about the more complicated defense.  Second Jack still teaches the Open Sicilian Variation saying that it's the most common analyzed by GM's.  In fact he told that to Perry.
2,0,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Meanwhile I just continue with the defense as if she played 2.Nf3 since this is still the main line. 
3,0,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is where she plays the move that I noted earlier and what I also like is that it develops.
4,0,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So do I by going right after e4.
5,0,5,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/2P5/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Protecting the e pawn.  Mary: We don't have to open the same way do we?  Joe: No.  There's always different openings.  I said that so that she didn't think that her earlier move which I said was actually a mistake or blunder.
6,0,6,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1p3/2P5/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile I take.
7,0,7,Nxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I take back.  
8,0,8,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In the meantime I continue development.
9,0,9,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2p1N3/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq f3',"?! This is an inaccuracy which I forgot to point out because it doesn't develop and it moves her weakest pawn.  At which point she could wind up in trouble.  I say that due to reflecting back on TA's Q sac.  He usually sacs on f2 or f7 with the idea being that it's the weakest square so once that pawn is gone even at the cost of his Q one must be careful.  In other words there's little to no room for errors as otherwise he forces the win.  The idea being that the weakest square is vulnerable which he can exploit.  And that is something that Joe pointed which I forgot to mention as we got involved with another chat.  In it Mary said ""We have to lose pieces.""  My response was Not necessarily.  Mary: I mean eventually.  Joe: Yes at some point pieces are exchanged."
10,0,10,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/2Pn1P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The idea behind this is to threaten to do something nasty.  Although it appears to be unsound there is a reason for this as I want her to learn.  So the idea bing is to give Mary the equivalent to Homework.  I will be creating which is actually a test to see if she finds the right move.  Whether she does or not I will tell her and why as it is a training session.
11,0,11,b3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/2Pn1P2/1P6/P2P2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Fianchettoing her LSB and getting a solid pawn chain.
12,0,12,Bf5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1Nb2/2Pn1P2/1P6/P2P2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"In the process of creating that nasty threat I also develop.  That is something else I also kept in mind.  So I wasn't going to say anything (as otherwise it's overcoaching) but I was evaluating.  Actually I got what it wanted because it wasn't easy for her to find the threat.  Instead Mary really had to think and why it accomplished my goals is because the way you learn is by really taking the time to think to see what's happening.  As Jack always says ""Start Thinking.""  But she spotted it nonetheless and with the right response."
13,0,13,d3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1Nb2/2Pn1P2/1P1P4/P5PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Joe: This is your best moves and it prevents the fork.  Mary: You and that evil fork.  The reason I stated that it was best was due to other alternative being 8.Bd3?? or 8.Nd3?? which both would've lost a piece due to my LSB.  So she prevented all of that.
14,0,14,g6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2p1Nb2/2Pn1P2/1P1P4/P5PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',With her playing the right move and given that my DSB would be crambed (if I were to advance the e pawn) I decide to fianchetto it.  This when I can bring it into play it'll be in a better place.
15,0,15,g4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2p1Nb2/2Pn1PP1/1P1P4/P6P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq g3',She temporarly has a way around it as Mary is threatening to win a piece.  This time I had about 8 hours of sleep and I know what happened last time.  If I didn't know her strength and hadn't gotten enough rest before yesterday I would've overlooked this which would've given her the advantage instead.  So I start thinking about where to retreat.  Now I don't want to undevelop this on c8 (where it initially started.)  
16,0,16,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/4bnp1/2p1N3/2Pn1PP1/1P1P4/P6P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Therefore aside from this and what I mentioned a move earlier the only other place I can go without losing a piece would be on d7.  The only problem is that my Q would be semi limited.  Not wanting to tie it down undevelop or lose anything I decided to play also keeping in mind that if Mary were to reattack with f5 she would lose a pawn.
17,0,17,1Bh3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/4bnp1/2p1N3/2Pn1PP1/1P1P3B/P6P/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So at last Mary develops a piece.  But with almost all my pieces out but I can use my developed pieces as well as the K to go on the attack.
18,0,18,1Qa5+,b'r3kb1r/pp2pp1p/4bnp1/q1p1N3/2Pn1PP1/1P1P3B/P6P/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"At this point there was a lot of discussion on what to do.  So this is where Jack got involved.  One thing he said is that we were doing something wrong by discussing too much as opposed to playing chess.  I told him that it's because I'm coaching her and when you train someone there is a lot of discussion.  He said ""I know but even so there is too much.""  Of course Jack was following OTB tourney rules and presumably preparing us for that.  The idea being is that on GK the rules aren't as strict.  And coaching is allirght as long as you don't collude with anyonelse aside from your opponent.  But in OTB the rules are that unless you announce check offer accept or decline a draw talking is considered cheating and therefore against the rules.  If you break that rule you get disqualified.  In addition the discussion was starting to distract Mr. Stockel and Petty.  So Jack got involved and when he did that's when the position became corrupt which made it impossible to annotate any more.  It's a shame because this was the only one and the game lasted about as long as the last annotation.  I can get exact numbers but I estimate from experience that the game lasted approximately 60 moves.  What happened is that I won a lot of material and had a winning advantage.  Two make matters worse I had both of my R's on one file with her remaining N directly pinned to her K and I also had an LSB around which threatened a nasty discover and double check which would've won more material immeidately.  In addition there was an added threat of mate.  But at the very end (due to being out of time) I made a terrible mistake that allowed her to get back a R which Jack showed.  By then it was a drawish position but we left it as an unfinished game.  That's why I recorded the game as being in progress.  Had I not made that mistake I would've said 0-1 as it would've been assumed that black had won.  But I let Jack point out the moral of this story.  And he stressed the importance of development and castling.  In it he told Mary that she I developed my pieces and castled whereas she did not.  This is important because as he accurately pointed out I could've won the game.  I agreed and just before I left I said that sometimes GM's make the same mistake pay the price by failing to do this.  Therefore there are occasions where one must deviate from General Opening Guidelines but in general you should follow it as the minor can work together to deliver a devastating attack.  And the way to remember that is ""Openings must be used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the middle game; what you do in the middle game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results."" "

85,3,16,1b5,b'r2q1rk1/4b1p1/p2p1pQp/1ppR4/2P5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R w - b6',He's counterattacking on the queenside.
86,3,17,2Rh5,b'r2q1rk1/4b1p1/p2p1pQp/1pp4R/2P5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R b - -',Threatening Rxh6.
87,3,18,2Qe8,b'r3qrk1/4b1p1/p2p1pQp/1pp4R/2P5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R w - -',A good response
88,3,19,2Qg4,b'r3qrk1/4b1p1/p2p1p1p/1pp4R/2P3Q1/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R b - -',I didn't want to exchange queens as I still had hope for the attack.
89,3,20,2f5,b'r3qrk1/4b1p1/p2p3p/1pp2p1R/2P3Q1/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R w - -',This allows me to win a pawn but it defuses the attack so I think it is quite a good move.
90,3,21,bxc4,b'r3q1k1/4b1p1/p2p3p/2p2Q2/2p5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R w - -',...And now he retakes his pawn but not for long...
91,3,22,2Qd5+,b'r3q1k1/4b1p1/p2p3p/2pQ4/2p5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R b - -',...Because I can do this. If he tries to save his pawn by playing Qf7 he loses his rook.
92,3,23,2Qxc4,b'r3q2k/4b1p1/p2p3p/2p5/2Q5/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R b - -',And material is even again.
93,3,24,2Qd5,b'r6k/4b1p1/p2p3p/1qpQ4/8/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R b - -',I decline the trade as it would have rejoined his pawns and opened the h file for his rook. In hindsight I think it would have been better to exchange though.
94,3,25,2Rb8,b'1r5k/4b1p1/p2p3p/1qpQ4/8/P3PN2/1P4PP/2K4R w - -',Threatening Qxb2+
95,3,26,Bf6,b'1r5k/6p1/p2p1b1p/1qp5/8/P3PN2/1P1Q2PP/2K4R w - -',Piling on the pressure
96,3,27,2b4,b'1r5k/6p1/p2p1b1p/1qp5/1P6/P3PN2/3Q2PP/2K4R b - b3',I think that was the best move but I could be wrong. It does however lose a pawn.
97,3,28,Rxb4,b'7k/6p1/p2p1b1p/8/1r6/4PN2/2K3PP/7R w - -',And we now enter the endgame. Black has a significant advantage. His rook is active while mine is hidden behind my pawns; he has a bishop for my knight; and he has an extra pawn. What's more that extra pawn is also passed. If I were black I would be looking forward to a win.
98,3,29,3Rb1,b'7k/6p1/p2p1b1p/8/1r6/4PN2/2K3PP/1R6 b - -',Trying to trade off my passive rook
99,3,30,3a5,b'7k/6p1/3p1b1p/p7/1r6/4PN2/2K3PP/1R6 w - -',I'm don't think this is a very good move. It allows me to exchange rooks and it also changes the passed pawn's promoting square from dark to light. I think this is a mistake because he has a dark squared bishop.
100,3,31,3Kb3,b'7k/6p1/3p1b1p/8/1p6/1K2PN2/6PP/8 b - -',I advance my king. My only advantage in this endgame is my king is active while his hides in the corner.
101,3,32,3Bc3,b'7k/6p1/3p3p/8/1p6/1Kb1PN2/6PP/8 w - -',Defends the pawn
102,3,33,3Nd4,b'7k/6p1/3p3p/8/1p1N4/1Kb1P3/6PP/8 b - -',I plan on playing Nc6 and then Nxb4.
103,3,34,3g5,b'7k/8/3p3p/6p1/1p1N4/1Kb1P3/6PP/8 w - g6',Opens a path for his king
104,3,35,Bd2,b'7k/8/2Np3p/6p1/1p6/1K2P3/3b2PP/8 w - -',This way he will remain ahead in material.
105,3,36,Bxe3,b'7k/8/3p3p/6p1/1N6/1K2b3/6PP/8 w - -',He still has a passed pawn but it is now closer to his king.
106,3,37,3Nd5,b'7k/8/3p3p/3N2p1/8/1K2b3/6PP/8 b - -',Prevents the passer from advancing
107,3,38,3Bf4,b'7k/8/3p3p/3N2p1/5b2/1K6/6PP/8 w - -',I believe this is the move that throws away the win. It allows me to exchange my knight for his superior bishop and it separates his pawns. In addition my king will reach his d pawn before him. Better would have been Bc5 followed by bringing his king into the fray.
108,3,39,3h3,b'7k/8/3p3p/3N2p1/5b2/1K5P/6P1/8 b - -',?? This is a big mistake. I should have taken his bishop. This gives him a chance to escape.
109,3,40,3Kg7,b'8/6k1/3p3p/3N2p1/5b2/1K5P/6P1/8 w - -',Luckily for me he doesn't.
110,3,41,gxf4,b'8/6k1/3p3p/8/5p2/1K5P/6P1/8 w - -',Now my situation is not quite as good as it would have been if I had taken his bishop immediately. I will no longer reach the d pawn before him. I was playing for a draw at this point.
111,3,42,h5,b'8/8/3p1k2/3K3p/5p2/7P/6P1/8 w - -',Instead of this I would have played Kg5 and tried to take white's pawns.
112,3,43,Kf5,b'8/8/3K4/5k1p/5p2/7P/6P1/8 w - -',Again I think Kg5 would have been better. This time because he cannot play Kg4 but he could play Kh4.
113,3,44,h4,b'8/8/8/3K1k2/5p1p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',This is a mistake. It prevents him from easily getting to my pawns.
114,3,45,4Ke4,b'8/8/8/6k1/4Kp1p/7P/6P1/8 b - -',He gives ground and I take advantage of it. Now he will lose a pawn.
115,3,46,4Kxf3,b'8/8/8/6k1/7p/5K1P/6P1/8 b - -',This is much better than taking with the pawn as it keeps my pawns connected. At this point I still believe he could draw but considering he has already made some mistakes I am hoping for a win.
116,3,47,4g4+,b'8/8/8/5k2/6Pp/5K1P/8/8 b - g3',Were he to take my pawn via en passant I believe the game could have ended a draw. That is because I think that a rook pawn and king cannot beat a king. I might be wrong in this feel free to correct me.
117,3,48,4Kg5,b'8/8/8/6k1/6Pp/5K1P/8/8 w - -',Instead he played this. This move confirmed the win for me.
118,3,49,Kg6,b'8/8/6k1/8/4K1Pp/7P/8/8 w - -',Now his pawn will fall.
119,3,50,5Kxh4,b'8/6k1/8/6P1/7K/7P/8/8 b - -',He has no chance of stopping two pawns.
120,3,51,5Kf5,b'8/6k1/8/5KPP/8/8/8/8 b - -',The black king is driven back.
121,3,52,5h6+,b'8/6k1/6PP/5K2/8/8/8/8 b - -',One pawn sacrifices himself so his comrade can go on to greater glory.
122,3,53,6Qd5,b'8/8/5K2/3Q4/5k2/8/8/8 b - -',I probably didn't end this as quickly as I could have but it doesn't really matter.
123,3,54,7Qg2#,b'8/8/8/8/8/5K2/6Qk/8 b - -',And mate! This was a very fun game and I was extremely happy to win it! When we started the endgame I was expecting a loss or a draw at the very best. I think he played the endgame less then perfectly and that allowed me to win. This is my second annotation so if you have any comments on my annotation style I'd appreciate them.
124,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So I start conventionally.
125,4,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He prevents 2. e4
126,4,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So I carry on with the most common reply.
127,4,3,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Dewi comes out with the Budapest Defense. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit
128,4,4,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So I take.
129,4,5,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of the pieces but it is virtually refuted by 4. a3! If white now tries to hang onto the pawn he usually fails or gets a compromised position.
130,4,6,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1P1n1/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I play this opening up a discovered attack with my queen on the Ng4. Now Nxe5 is met with 5. f4 and white has a space advantage.
131,4,7,h5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4P2p/2P1P1n1/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq h6',But Dewi plays another move. Already I am thinking for myself. After the game it struck me that maybe white should just play 5. h3 here and we reach the same position as after 4. e4 Nxe5 but with black having played h5 and white having played h3. I suspect that h3 is more use to white than h5 is to black and white should have an advantage in that variation. Surprisingly I can't see this on either of the Gameknot opening databases.
132,4,8,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4P2p/2P1P1n1/8/PP2BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',But I played this attacking the Ng4 again.
133,4,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n5/4P2p/2P1P1n1/8/PP2BPPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',But he just ignores it. If I now capture twice on g4 he has d6 uncovering an attack on my queen followed by taking on e5. Black is a pawn down but with some compensation in the form to two bishops better development and some open lines. So I chose another move.
134,4,10,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n5/4P2p/2P1P1n1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I put my faith in development again.
135,4,11,Bb4+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n5/4P2p/1bP1P1n1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This pesky check helps his development. Now I thought that he was getting back his pawn but I may be able to get the two bishops by blocking with my Nb1. I also considered by Bc1 to be my better bishop worth hanging on to. 
136,4,12,Nbd2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n5/4P2p/1bP1P1n1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I blocked this way.
137,4,13,Ncxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P1n1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',He took.
138,4,14,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4N2p/1bP1P1n1/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I took.
139,4,15,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',He took back.
140,4,16,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I castled preparing f2-f4
141,4,17,Qh4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P2q/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This surprised me. He is now threatening to exchange on d2 and then capture on e4.
142,4,18,1Qc2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P2q/8/PPQNBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',So I protect e4.
143,4,19,1Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/4n2p/2P1P2q/8/PPQNBPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',This was another surprise. After the game we looked at lines like 11. c5	Ng4 12. Nf3	Bxh2+ 13. Kh1 Nxf2+ 14. Rxf2 Qxf2 15. Kxh2 and although black has a narrow material advantage - rook and two pawns for bishop and knight - black has lost all his attacking pieces except his queen which can be harassed. The initiative has passed to white. Unfortunately instead I made a dreadful error.
144,4,20,1Re1,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/4n2p/2P1P2q/8/PPQNBPPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',Almost immediately after playing this I realized it was a mistake. 
145,4,21,1Ng4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/7p/2P1P1nq/8/PPQNBPPP/R1B1R1K1 w kq -',Because of this move with threats to f2 and h2.
146,4,22,1Bxg4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/7p/2P1P1Bq/8/PPQN1PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',So I remove his knight.
147,4,23,1Qxh2+,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/7p/2P1P1B1/8/PPQN1PPq/R1B1R1K1 w kq -',He throws in a check.
148,4,24,1Kf1,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/7p/2P1P1B1/8/PPQN1PPq/R1B1RK2 b kq -',Forced!
149,4,25,1hxg4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/8/2P1P1p1/8/PPQN1PPq/R1B1RK2 w kq -',He takes back. He is now threatening Qh1+ followed by Qxg2. My next move prevents this but 14. e4-e5 is objectively white's best as Bc5 can be met with Ne4 protecting f2 and attacking Bc5.
150,4,26,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/3b4/8/2P1P1p1/6P1/PPQN1P1q/R1B1RK2 b kq -',So now black is just a pawn up although maybe it would be hard to make anything of it as it is a doubled pawn.
151,4,27,1Bxg3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/6b1/PPQN1P1q/R1B1RK2 w kq -',This is the unsound bishop sacrifice.
152,4,28,1fxg3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/6P1/PPQN3q/R1B1RK2 b kq -',So I take.
153,4,29,1Qxg3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/6q1/PPQN4/R1B1RK2 w kq -',He takes back.
154,4,30,1Ke2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/6q1/PPQNK3/R1B1R3 b kq -',My king reaches relative safety on d1 and black hasn't quite got enough for a knight.
155,4,31,1Qh2+,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/8/PPQNK2q/R1B1R3 w kq -',Dewi prepares to advance his main asset - his g pawn.
156,4,32,1Kd1,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1p1/8/PPQN3q/R1BKR3 b kq -',My king reaches relative security on d1. He has 3 pawns for a knight but I have an edge now. Round about here I turn down a draw.
157,4,33,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/6p1/PPQN3q/R1BKR3 w kq -',"""Passed pawns need to be pushed""!"
158,4,34,1Nf3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/5Np1/PPQ4q/R1BKR3 b kq -',But now my knight reaches a good square.
159,4,35,1Qh3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/5Npq/PPQ5/R1BKR3 w kq -',He avoids the exchange of queens.
160,4,36,1Be3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/4BNpq/PPQ5/R2KR3 b kq -',But now there is no way he is going to promote on g1 with 3 pieces - rook knight and bishop - protecting it.
161,4,37,1g2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/4BN1q/PPQ3p1/R2KR3 w kq -',But onwards the pawn marches - it may have been better to finish black's development and prepare to play 0-0-0. At last most of my pieces are working well together.
162,4,38,2Qf2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P3/4BN1q/PP3Qp1/R2KR3 b kq -',Preparing to move my king to d2 or c2 to link my rooks.
163,4,39,2Qg4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2P1P1q1/4BN2/PP3Qp1/R2KR3 w kq -',Dewi attacks e4.
164,4,40,2Bd4,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP3Qp1/R2KR3 b kq -',This move protects e4 with my rook and also attacks g7
165,4,41,2Rh1,b'r1b1k3/pppp1pp1/8/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP3Qp1/R2KR2r w q -',His rook comes in.
166,4,42,2Kd2,b'r1b1k3/pppp1pp1/8/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP1K1Qp1/R3R2r b q -',King moves.
167,4,43,2Rxe1,b'r1b1k3/pppp1pp1/8/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP1K1Qp1/R3r3 w q -',He takes.
168,4,44,2Rxe1,b'r1b1k3/pppp1pp1/8/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP1K1Qp1/4R3 b q -',I take back. But this whole maneuver has exchanges his active rook on h8 for my inactive one on a1. Dewi would have been better advised to develop his queen side.
169,4,45,2d6,b'r1b1k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/8/2PBP1q1/5N2/PP1K1Qp1/4R3 w q -',Which he finally starts.
170,4,46,2Nh4,b'r1b1k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/8/2PBP1qN/8/PP1K1Qp1/4R3 b q -',I attack g2 again.
171,4,47,2Qg5+,b'r1b1k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/6q1/2PBP2N/8/PP1K1Qp1/4R3 w q -',He throws in a check.
172,4,48,2Kc2,b'r1b1k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/6q1/2PBP2N/8/PPK2Qp1/4R3 b q -',King moves.
173,4,49,2Bh3,b'r3k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/6q1/2PBP2N/7b/PPK2Qp1/4R3 w q -',Bishop comes out to add another protection to g2.
174,4,50,2Rg1,b'r3k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/6q1/2PBP2N/7b/PPK2Qp1/6R1 b q -',But my rook attacks g2 again.
175,4,51,2Qg4,b'r3k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/8/2PBP1qN/7b/PPK2Qp1/6R1 w q -',So Dewi renews the attack on e4.
176,4,52,2Kd3,b'r3k3/ppp2pp1/3p4/8/2PBP1qN/3K3b/PP3Qp1/6R1 b q -',I protect. His pawn on g2 is now a goner. 
177,4,53,2O-O-O,b'2kr4/ppp2pp1/3p4/8/2PBP1qN/3K3b/PP3Qp1/6R1 w - -',He finally develops.
178,4,54,2Qf5+,b'2kr4/ppp2pp1/3p4/5Q2/2PBP1qN/3K3b/PP4p1/6R1 b - -',Rather than taking the pawn immediately I consider it more important to take the queens off.
179,4,55,2Qxf5,b'2kr4/ppp2pp1/3p4/5q2/2PBP2N/3K3b/PP4p1/6R1 w - -',So Dewi takes.
180,4,56,2Nxf5,b'2kr4/ppp2pp1/3p4/5N2/2PBP3/3K3b/PP4p1/6R1 b - -',I take back.
181,4,57,2g6,b'2kr4/ppp2p2/3p2p1/5N2/2PBP3/3K3b/PP4p1/6R1 w - -',He hits the knight.
182,4,58,3Ne3,b'2kr4/ppp2p2/3p2p1/8/2PBP3/3KN2b/PP4p1/6R1 b - -',Again - the g2 pawn is going.
183,4,59,3f5,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p2p1/5p2/2PBP3/3KN2b/PP4p1/6R1 w - f6',He correctly tries to exchange pawns.
184,4,60,3exf5,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p2p1/5P2/2PB4/3KN2b/PP4p1/6R1 b - -',So I take.
185,4,61,3gxf5,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p4/5p2/2PB4/3KN2b/PP4p1/6R1 w - -',He takes back.
186,4,62,3Nxg2,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p4/5p2/2PB4/3K3b/PP4N1/6R1 b - -',The g2 pawn finally falls.
187,4,63,3Bxg2,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p4/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP4b1/6R1 w - -',I think this is a mistake - there is no need to make this exchange.
188,4,64,3Rxg2,b'2kr4/ppp5/3p4/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP4R1/8 b - -',So I take back.
189,4,65,3Kd7,b'3r4/pppk4/3p4/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP4R1/8 w - -',He at last mobilizes his king.
190,4,66,3Rg6,b'3r4/pppk4/3p2R1/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',I prevent his king from advancing and prepare to attack f5 from f6. This give Dewi the unpalatable option of losing his f pawn or allowing the exchange of rooks. He opts for the latter.  
191,4,67,3Rf8,b'5r2/pppk4/3p2R1/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 w - -',So he prepares to advance the pawn.
192,4,68,3Rf6,b'5r2/pppk4/3p1R2/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',And I give him that choice.
193,4,69,3Rxf6,b'8/pppk4/3p1r2/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 w - -',And he exchanges.
194,4,70,3Bxf6,b'8/pppk4/3p1B2/5p2/2P5/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',And I take back!
195,4,71,3Ke6,b'8/ppp5/3pkB2/5p2/2P5/3K4/PP6/8 w - -',He advances his king.
196,4,72,3Bd4,b'8/ppp5/3pk3/5p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',I retreat. I am not really threatening to take on a7 yet but if he plays say Kf7 then I can take on a7.
197,4,73,3c5,b'8/pp6/3pk3/2p2p2/2PB4/3K4/PP6/8 w - c6',He puts an end to the ideas of Bd4 taking on a7. He now wants to exchange another pawn with d6-d5. In those circumstances I have to be very careful. If he can exchanges my b pawn too I could be left with wrong bishop and rook pawn which can't be promoted. 
198,4,74,3Be3,b'8/pp6/3pk3/2p2p2/2P5/3KB3/PP6/8 b - -',So now he can't play d6-d5 without losing his c pawn.
199,4,75,3b6,b'8/p7/1p1pk3/2p2p2/2P5/3KB3/PP6/8 w - -',So he protects c5 again.
200,4,76,3Bf4,b'8/p7/1p1pk3/2p2p2/2P2B2/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',This also should prevent d6-d5.
201,4,77,3d5,b'8/p7/1p2k3/2pp1p2/2P2B2/3K4/PP6/8 w - -',He plays this move too soon. Dewi should prepare it with say a7-a6.
202,4,78,4Bb8,b'1B6/p7/1p2k3/2pp1p2/2P5/3K4/PP6/8 b - -',Now he is losing at least another one pawn and the position is lost.
203,4,79,4dxc4+,b'1B6/p7/1p2k3/2p2p2/2p5/3K4/PP6/8 w - -',So he takes with check.
204,4,80,4Kxc4,b'1B6/p7/1p2k3/2p2p2/2K5/8/PP6/8 b - -',I take back.
205,4,81,4Kd7,b'1B6/p2k4/1p6/2p2p2/2K5/8/PP6/8 w - -',His king comes across.
206,4,82,4Bxa7,b'8/B2k4/1p6/2p2p2/2K5/8/PP6/8 b - -',I take.
207,4,83,4Kc7,b'8/B1k5/1p6/2p2p2/2K5/8/PP6/8 w - -',He briefly traps my bishop but my king is coming to its aid.
208,4,84,4Kb5,b'8/B1k5/1p6/1Kp2p2/8/8/PP6/8 b - -',With this move.
209,4,85,4f4,b'8/B1k5/1p6/1Kp5/5p2/8/PP6/8 w - -',This is too slow.
210,4,86,4Bxb6+,b'8/2k5/1B6/1Kp5/5p2/8/PP6/8 b - -',And Dewi now resigned. Many thanks for reading. Please rate this on the star system and leave a message or two. Until next time dear reader!
211,5,0,Bxf7+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the only move I question because the initial agreement was that white would 5.Nxf7 and then black would play 5...Bxf2  My guess is that white didn't want to go into all those variations and think he can win by playing taking with the B since he is stronger.  But this is very difficult to access especially when you count the fact that black will be victorious in the end.
212,5,1,Ke7,b'r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',I would've played 5...Kf8 instead.  But seeing that he moved here means that moving to f8 wouldn't be as good.  I just don't know why this is better it is interesting since.  From what I've learned unless it's an endgame getting the K off the homesquare is less safe.
213,5,2,Bc4,b'r1bq3r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',The idea being is that if white can ever fork black's Q and R black cannot refute the threat with ...Nf7  So he is definitely threatening to win material.  Therefore (although it's a move I wouldn't have thought of) I really like it.  That's because GM Damien Lemos told me in an e-mail course that in chess one thing you want to do is create a threat that is difficult to drive off.  It turns out that this is what white is doing.
214,5,3,Qe8,b'r1b1q2r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',At first I wasn't sure why black played this but it makes sense.  In this position white was threatening 7.Nf7  So He is preventing a nasty fork which would lose a R for N.  
215,5,4,O-O,b'r1b1q2r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Knowing that Nf7 won't work white gets his K to safety at once.  Believe it or not this is also what I would've played.  
216,5,5,d6,b'r1b1q2r/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Developing a center pawn.  For the obvious reason I would not have even considered 7...d5  But this however is the same move that I would've played as it gives the opportunity for black to complete development.  Despite it looking bad for him for the reasons mentioned one thing that's important to note however is that black is a move ahead in development.  While it might seem insignificant especially at our ratings for them this is especially important.  For example when tactical-abyss saccs his early and wins he points out important points.  One of them is that his opponent should win but the reason they don't is due to their lack of develeloped.  So when Joe completes his development and they haven't one thing he does is coordinate his remaining pieces for a devastating attack.  Just being one move behind in development can make all the difference in the world.  In fact I recall seeing one of those games where that happened.  Well the same thing could be said here but with the setup being difference as with any variety it's interesting to see what will become of this.
217,5,6,c3,b'r1b1q2r/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',This time I have no idea why white played this.  My guess is that he is thinking along the lines of b4 so that when black retreats he can use that time to complete his development.
218,5,7,Rf8,b'r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',However I don't know why black played this.  But this time I don't see the point.
219,5,8,Nf3,b'r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',I am also not sure why white moved here.  I don't see anything wrong with 9.b4 for the reasons outlined earlier.  In other words I don't see any immediate threats so that is what I would've played.  
220,5,9,Bg4,b'r3qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',"Meanwhile black has just completed development.  And while he's still down by a pawn and can't castle I think it's even.  In fact I am ironically starting to favor black's position.  But I can be very wrong which is why I won't draw conclusions and anything can still happen.  In fact where we are reminds me of as archduke_piccolo calls it ""Back to School""."
221,5,10,1d3,b'r3qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',While analyzing b4 I like this move a lot as it develops a central.  Yes I normally would consider deviating from guidelines as these players do but others like easy19 and even tactical-abyss (when I used one of his techniques from the Q sac) said that against stronger players one should not deviate from The General Opening Guidelines.  Of course there are exceptions to which you must but otherwise you should follow them since they have more experience.
222,5,11,1Qg6,b'r4r2/ppp1k1pp/2np1nq1/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Connecting his R's.

The idea being as I learned from Jack Stockel is that when you're faced in a situation like this (that is where a threat allumes) The K should be in the corner.  And it is part of K safety.  In a position like this I understand where that applies. 
224,5,13,1Qh5,b'r4r2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p2q/2B1P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1R1K w - -',Although I've tried to analyze it I don't see the point behind this move.  I was initially thinking that black wanted to prevent Nh4 except that the N is indirectly pinned to the Q anyhow.  But some things that don't make sense to us make sense to much stronger player like these two.
225,5,14,1Nbd2,b'r4r2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p2q/2B1P1b1/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',Adding a defender to the f3.

I know because this is something that TA mentioned in another Q sac which was opened files.  I also annotated that game and one of the commentators also mentioned the importance of open files.  In addition he is preventing white from attacking the DSB since the loss of tempo would be ugly.
227,5,16,1Kg1,b'r4r2/1pp1k1pp/2np1n2/p1b1p2q/2B1P1b1/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I am not sure why he played this.

I know because this was an example that Susan Polgar gave when she talked about strategy.  That was why they appear to cram their N's.  While they appear that way there is a plan and usually they get a better position with a stronger outpost and the idea is about how to improve your position.
229,5,18,1h3,b'r4r2/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p1b1p2q/2B1P1b1/2PP1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Getting rid of black annoying LSB.  I am not sure if its the right choice.  While white is a pawn up because a recent annotator said the same thing that elyhim emphasized.  When you're behind exchange pawns not pieces the problem is that with this move white will lose the exchange.  In other words after exchanging pieces white will go from ahead to behind.  From there I think that black will have a clear advantage.  However it's impossible to conclude or even state as a fact since white is a much stronger player.  So things can still change.
230,5,19,1Nh2,b'r4r2/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p1b1p3/2B1P3/2PP3q/PP1N1P1N/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',?? I am not sure why white played this.  But in my opinion it's a blunder because black will further liquidate but more important white's K will become exposed.  Therefore I think it's safe to conclude that black is winning.  However I don't know if white has anything to counter it.  If the two players were the same strength then I'd think otherwise.  However stronger player can and does things that will throw the opponents off guard.  An example happened in a game that Mr. Stockel annotated.  It was with GM Bobby Fischer against his opponent.  Now Fischer played a move that everyone including the computer thought was a losing blunder that would lose the game (and I forget the variations btw).  But Fischer saw something that no onelse did.  And what appeared to be a losing mistake was in reality the winning move.
231,5,20,Qg3+,b'r7/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p3p3/2B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1N4/R1BQK3 w - -',As implied earlier white is in trouble.
232,5,21,2Ke2,b'r7/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p3p3/2B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1NK3/R1BQ4 b - -',I like 20.Kf1 better but I guess white wants to keep his monarch closer to his pieces.
233,5,22,2Rf8,b'5r2/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p3p3/2B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1NK3/R1BQ4 w - -',Threatening something nasty.
234,5,23,2Qh1,b'5r2/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p3p3/2B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1NK3/R1B4Q b - -',However this is still the better alternative since there is no mate anyhow.  And it's better then losing a Q for a R.  With that being said black's next move will not kill white.
235,5,24,2Kd1,b'8/1ppnk1pp/2np4/p3p3/2B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1N1r2/R1BK3Q b - -',Forced.
236,5,25,2a4,b'8/1ppnk1pp/2np4/4p3/p1B1P3/2PP2q1/PP1N1r2/R1BK3Q w - -',But this is what black had in mind.  I think that the long term plan for him is to get a passed pawn which would however prove to be lethal for white.
237,5,26,2b4,b'8/1ppnk1pp/2np4/4p3/pPB1P3/2PP2q1/P2N1r2/R1BK3Q b - b3',Personally I would've tried to stop it with 23.b3  Now if black wants he can make an en-pessant capture with 23...axb3 e.p.
238,5,27,2Nf6,b'8/1pp1k1pp/2np1n2/4p3/pPB1P3/2PP2q1/P2N1r2/R1BK3Q w - -',That is what I would've done.  But I like this move almost as well because as noted earlier black has found a stronger outpost for his N.
239,5,28,2Kc2,b'8/1pp1k1pp/2np1n2/4p3/pPB1P3/2PP2q1/P1KN1r2/R1B4Q b - -',Since this is not an endgame yet I don't know why white played this.  The idea being is that usually where we are the K does not play a role so bringing out isn't a good idea.  But given how much stronger these players are I don't what role to bring it out earlier.
240,5,29,2h5,b'8/1pp1k1p1/2np1n2/4p2p/pPB1P3/2PP2q1/P1KN1r2/R1B4Q w - h6',This time black has two passed pawns so he is going to start using to his abilities a that's an important part of tactics.  That is especially because we're now nearing the endgame.  It's not quite yet but I think that will change shortly.
241,5,30,2Kb1,b'8/1pp1k1p1/2np1n2/4p2p/pPB1P3/2PP2q1/P2N1r2/RKB4Q b - -',Therefore the K does play an important role at this point.  I think white's plan is to get his monarch to a3 where there will be pressure against a4.

246,5,35,2g4,b'8/1pp1k3/2np1n2/4p2p/pPB1Pqp1/P1PP4/R2N1r2/1KB4Q w - -',As noted black achieves a solid pawn chain with this move.  And with it a promotion will become inevitable.  I saw a similar example with tactical-abyss involving where someone did get an edge and promoted with a pawn chain like this.  That's where they especially play an important role.  I remembered that in my game against redfoxrising in my toughest endgame ever.  I mean it was more difficult then anything I've ever studied yet I remembered those as well and followed everything I knew about endgames.  One thing that played the role and allowed me to force the win was the pawn chain similar to what we're seeing now.

252,5,41,3g2,b'8/1pp1k3/2np1n2/3Pp2p/pPB1P1q1/P1P5/R2N1rp1/1KB1Q3 w - -',But this does not bother black as I also outlined.  And now white takes the R instead after which will make a second Q.

However it really isn't near even because despite being only the equivalent to a pawn up white will lose his Q whereas black will keep it.  And stay tuned because as we're about to see black has something up his sleeve as they say.

260,5,49,3e4,b'8/2p1k3/2pp4/8/pPB1p2p/P1P5/1KRB1n2/5Nq1 w - -',"With another passer black takes advantage of it because as the saying goes ""Passed pawns must be pushed.""  And this move guarantees a promotion for black.  With that being said I'd say that the game is lost for white.  But it's still worth fighting and being aggressive because you still don't know what'll happen.  However I don't think that white has a chance of counterplay at this point."

266,5,55,4Ne3,b'8/2p1k3/8/3p1R2/p3p2p/PqP1N3/4B3/2K5 b - -',The idea being that if black takes white will recapture.  So the plan is to prevent black from getting another pawn.
267,5,56,4Qxc3+,b'8/2p1k3/8/3p1R2/p3p2p/P1q1N3/4B3/2K5 w - -',But it's too little too late.  And I think that black made the right choice because he took the passed pawn.  The thing is that none of them are passes pawns.  But a pawn doesn't have to be a passer in order to be considered dangerous.  a3 was not concern as it was blocked by black's a4 but c3 because although it's not passed white was threatening to isolate.  The plan was 46.d4 and after 46...dxc4 47.Nxc4 and now aside from h4 not only would black have two isolated pawns but the rest of them would be blocked.  And if white were to play Bf1 which I believe was the plan the h pawn would be no longer be a concern either since it can't advance further.  And from that I think would end in a draw so this does more then just nab a dangerous pawn.  In doing so black deprives white's chance of counterplay.
268,5,57,4Nc2,b'8/2p1k3/8/3p1R2/p3p2p/P1q5/2N1B3/2K5 b - -',Intervening to prevent the loss of a piece.  Now I believe it was GM Susan Polgar who said that when in check don't think that you should automatically get out with the K.  Sometimes it's better to intercede with a piece as we see here.
269,5,58,4Kd6,b'8/2p5/3k4/3p1R2/p3p2p/P1q5/2N1B3/2K5 w - -',Although winning black is centralizing his King.  The idea being as noted earlier is that the monarch is quite dangerous in the end game.
270,5,59,4Bb5,b'8/2p5/3k4/1B1p1R2/p3p2p/P1q5/2N5/2K5 b - -',But with his last move white will get a pawn.  However in this particular position losing a pawn is not a big deal because it was useless on a4.  This is something that Jack Stockel has emphasized and he calls it a bad pawn.  He said that winning a bad pawn (in the endgame) doesn't do much.  That's because it's more like a gambit (in it's late stages).  So when he or she takes it the opponent uses that time to advance a passed pawn which will often allow a promotion as we will see later on. 
271,5,60,4c6,b'8/8/2pk4/1B1p1R2/p3p2p/P1q5/2N5/2K5 w - -',Gaining time with a pawn chain in the process.  But as noted above when white takes black will advance a passer until a promotion is guaranteed.
272,5,61,4Kb1,b'8/8/2pk4/3p1R2/B6p/P1q1p3/2N5/1K6 b - -',Doing whatever he can to minimize the damage.
273,5,62,4e2,b'8/8/2pk4/3p1R2/B6p/P1q5/2N1p3/1K6 w - -',But it's too late.
274,5,63,5Ka2,b'8/8/2pk4/3p1R2/B6p/P1q5/K1N1p3/8 b - -',Protecting a2 which is his only passed pawn.  But to throw white off guard (in my opinion) black will advance a different pawn.
275,5,64,5Rh5,b'8/8/2pk4/3p3R/B7/P1q4p/K1N1p3/8 b - -',Stopping that pawn from Queening.  But black will promote the other pawn that he has been advancing for several moves.
276,5,65,5Qd2,b'8/8/2pk4/3p3R/B7/P6p/K1Nqp3/8 w - -',Guaranteeing the promotion so that when white takes black will have a second Q regardless.  This time however the damage is irrevocable.
277,5,66,5Rh6+,b'8/8/2pk3R/3p4/B7/P7/K1Nq4/4q3 b - -',Trying to do what he can white gives check.
278,5,67,Kf8,b'5k2/7R/2p5/3p4/B7/P7/K1Nq4/4q3 w - -',Following triangles because when white checks again the K will move to another file.  So he is moving in a triangle by playing ...Ke7 ...Kf8 and ...Kg7  Now Susan Polgar has said that in endgames where you have an advantage with a difficult win triangulation is the way to go.  That's why even though I disregarded and eliminated the trigonometry after blocking a certain someone I resumed it again.  That is because she said that the trigonometry involving the K it is how you win in complicated positions like this.  And with this form of triangulation white will run out of checks as black will get tempo to add insult to injury.  The reason being is that after 55...Kg7 if white checks he'll lose his R.  So by retreating black will do further damage.
279,5,68,d4,b'1R6/6k1/2p5/8/B2p4/P7/K1Nq4/4q3 w - -',The reason being is that with this move black's passer on d4 is protected by his Q.  And black can clear a path by moving his d3 Q to allow ...d3 and if white protects and attacks after with Nb4 black can answer with ...c5 not just attacking the N but achieving another pawn chain in the process.
280,5,69,5Rb2,b'8/6k1/2p5/8/B2p4/P7/KRNq4/4q3 b - -',Adding a defender.  But black has an answer to that.
281,5,70,5Qee2,b'8/6k1/2p5/8/B2p4/P7/KRNqq3/8 w - -',The reason being is that he has added another attacker to that rank.  Therefore white is in bigger trouble.
282,5,71,5Rb7+,b'8/1R4k1/2p5/8/B2p4/P7/K1Nqq3/8 b - -',Without anything to lose white checks.
283,5,72,5Rb2,b'8/8/2p3k1/8/B2p4/P7/KRNqq3/8 b - -',It's proven with this move because after getting out white comes back here since white must defend against the pressure.
284,5,73,5d3,b'8/8/2p3k1/8/B7/P2p4/KRNqq3/8 w - -',However the pressure has now become overwhelming for white to handle.
285,5,74,6Bb3,b'8/8/2p3k1/8/8/PB1p4/KRNqq3/8 b - -',I would've played 60.Bxc6 to get a pawn out of this.  But it doesn't matter what he does because white is toast.
286,5,75,6Rxc2,b'8/8/2p3k1/8/8/PB6/K1Rqq3/8 b - -',I would've recaptured with 61.Bxc2 because I would've felt slightly more comfortable.  But it won't do anything in this position no matter how you look at it.
287,5,76,6Qdxc2+,b'8/8/2p3k1/8/8/PB6/K1q1q3/8 w - -',At this point black resigned.  And now we can apply exactly what I know from how to mate with your N+B but with the colors reversed since black has the mate.  So with that being said black will be able to confine white's K to one square (a1).  And then there would be no way to avoid mate.  Worth noting that one of the reasons I kept studying the K against K+B+N (taking the test until finally passing where it became second nature) as noted in chicoboy's legacy; was so that I could notate something similar which applies in all endgames.  With that being said here is a sample line of how black would mate.  After 62.Bxc2 Qxc2 63.Ka1 Qe4 64.Kb2 c5 65.Kb3 c4+ 66.Kc3 Qd3+ 67.Kb4 c3+ 68.Kb3 c2+ 69.Kb2 Qd1 70.Ka2 c1=Q   And now that the K is pinned the only move left is 71.a4 in which case 71...Qa1# 71...Qb1# 71...Qc2# or 71...Qd2# are all mate.  Since white saw this happening he wasn't going to stay in any longer.

However doubled pawns in the center with supporting side pawns can provide some attack options and opening a file for a rook is never a bad thing IF White takes.
322,7,15,1Bxe6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2npBn2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',And he takes.  I'm not immediately opposed to this play but White should also consider b3 or b5 if just to prevent me from getting an open file for my rooks to getting greater reach.

325,7,18,1Qxe4,b'r4rk1/ppp1q1pp/2npp3/4p3/4Q3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',In general I like taking with the queen more than the d pawn to get a more centralized location from which to assault the board and keep some attack options on the e5 pawn.  However I can harass White and gain some tempo by moving my rook all because White let me get a half-open file on turn 10.  Because of the free tempo move I probably would have taken dxe4.

If White can't force me to move my rook it's a strong projection of power into his half of the board.  White's priority should be leveraging his knight to dislodge my rook.  That is complicated because of the position of White's queen.
328,7,21,1Rae1,b'5rk1/ppp1q1pp/2npp3/4p3/5r2/3P1N1P/PPP1QPP1/4RRK1 b - -',I might have moved Nd2 or c3.  Another strong move to consider is Rad1.

360,8,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Reuben decided that I'd get the white pieces and as such I can play stuff that's completely in my comfort zone. I'm not sure why he'd give me this small advantage but maybe he wants to test himself to the fullest. If he ever challenges me and gives me the black pieces instead then I'd still be very willing to play. We're in for an interesting match.
361,8,1,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Queens gambit accepted. It's not really a trend here in Belgium or even online as you see the declined variations far more often but it's definitely playable for black given that he has a vague idea of what he's doing. Usually when my opponents play the QGA it'll go something like this: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. e4 e5 4. Nf3 exd4 5. Bxc4 or 1. d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bxc4 Nb6 6. Bb3. Those 2 variations are the most played ones for as far as my limited knowledge on the QGA goes. This is of course assuming that white plays e4 and not the e3 variation which is another story altogether. Needless to say the QGA leads to fascinating games no matter what variation you play.
362,8,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Some people play Nf3 which is the most popular response some play e3 some play Nc3 . I personally like e4 as it quickly seizes the centre before any knights are aimed at it. e3 is something I used to play and while it does lead to a fine position for White with barely any weaknesses it's quite a bit slower if you want to start a heavy attack in the center. Nf3 is very solid and is a prep move for e4 as black often replies with an immediate e5 if White plays e4 like I do. That being said I don't mind e5 being played at all as it makes games quite exciting. Nc3 is arguably the worse of the 4 options. I used to play Nc3 for some time as well and usually I'd be fine but it can get rather tricky when opponents respond with 3. ... a6! which isn't an option when e4 or e3 is played instead threatening the pawn on c4 immediately. a6 in the Nc3 variation forces White to play 4. a4 as a response which I didn't really like. Black can often get counterplay on the queenside with some form of pawnstorm and by abusing the knight on c3. Of course black can play b5 here in this position with the idea of playing a6 afterwards but that's countered by a4 which is a lot stronger against b5 than a6 since it asks for immediate action. a6 as a response to a4 isn't a good defence either since it allows for axb5 and Black is not able to recapture because of axb5 Rxa8! The only way to keep the pawn of b5 alive is then either Qd7 blocking the bishop Bd7 which is a bad square for the bishop or c6 giving a rather iffy pawn structure resembling something along the lines of the botvinnik variation in the QGA ( or the anti-meran as some people name it ). Some people still play that last variation with c6 and that's one of very few reasons why people play e3 instead of e4 since then white has the counter of Qf3 putting a lot of indirect pressure on the a8 rook. Now this all seems like a lot to take in considering it's just turn 3 but it's exactly these little nuances why I enjoy playing the queens gambit so much.
363,8,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A little bit peculiar in my opinion. A common idea in the accepted variation is that black eventually wants to play c5 and disrupt White's centre forcing White to choose between variations where he either captures on c5 or ignores the threat and allows Black to capture on d4. To give you an idea of how powerful and often necessary this move is: c5 is in the most classical variations played as early as move 5 . With the knight being on c6 this becomes a lot harder to do. As a result black often falls into a very passive state where he just quietly develops but afterwards finds it hard to find a concrete plan. Of course Reuben can solve this issue in the future but it's something for me to keep in mind. It reminds me a little bit of a game I played versus Mehdi Kademali ( 1693 elo otb at that time ) which is annotated here on gameknot. In the game he ends up playing Nc6 on move 6 tries to transpose into another opening but fails to find good counterplay and gets the beatdown as I dictated most of that game. I did end up drawing that game due to sloppiness on my part but ever since then I'm well aware that Nc6 can be a problem for Black.

367,8,7,Qd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bBPP3/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I've lost the pawn on e4 too many times in the past. I was considering e5 but it gets tricky if Black responds with Ne4 as the pressure can easily become really overwhelming. Note that Bd3 although interesting isn't a defence since it loses the pawn on d4 instead therefore Qd3 is most likely the most appropriate defence. It also centralises my queen for further attacks in the future especially if he castles kingside since I'll get some pressure on the b1-h7 diagonal.
368,8,8,Bxc3+,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BPP3/2bQ1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I'm not sure what trading does for reuben here aside from giving me the bishop pair and solidifying my center by giving me the ability to play bxc3. On top of that of that the b-file becomes an open file for my rook. It's not a game losing move just yet but the difference in terms of center control is starting to become glaringly obvious and sadly c5 is not available either to contest that center control.
369,8,9,1e5,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/4P3/2BP4/2PQ1N2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Finally going for the push since his knight doesn't have a lot of good squares aside from d7 and d5. Nd5 as a response seems most interesting but I think Nd7 might be called for here since with my queen on the b1-h7 diagonal my bishop being able to either pressure the c1-h6 diagonal or the a3-f8 diagonal my knight on d3 being able to jump over at g5 and my light squared bishop I got quite a bit of pressure on his castled structure. There's room for all different sorts of attacks and tricks there. As a consequence I think Nd7 is slightly better since it allows for Nf8 and eventually for Ng6 guarding the crucial light squares around the king. This comes at the cost of blocking your pieces in a little bit more though so it's definitely not an easy move to make as it goes against the principle of getting a strong knight in the center.

I still think Nd7 was better but blocking in your pieces like that isn't a move that looks very appealing so I can definitely understand the reasoning behind Nd5. Especially since it also targets the pawn on c3 which could become a freebie if I were to have some fancy plan with my queen.

Nd7 could have prevented all this.

It reminds me of a theme I saw in a game last week where a GM played Bb4 to invoke a weakness in Carlsen's position and then retreated it back all the way to f8 which stunned me back then as I didn't see a reason to retreat it at all. The reasoning was that the bishop had induced a slight weakness in the position and thus he wanted to play g6 followed by Bg7.

Of course taking the knight is the best move but I had just woken up minutes ago and thus missed it. The idea behind Qe3 is to seize the dark squares around his king and then afterwards to try and force Nf6 or Ng5 in.

The reason why f5 is neccesary is because it immediately pressures my knight and because of his knight on d5 it's not possible to go to f6. The best continuation for both black and White respectively is probably something along the lines of 14. Qh6 f5 15. Bg5 Qd7 16. Bxd5 ( eliminating the defender of the f6 square ) fxe4 ( Can't take the bishop because of Nf6 being too strong so you have to capture the knight instead. ) 17. Bxe4 with White winning a pawn and having a monstrously strong position. Black can probably still hold the position after that but he'll be treading a very thin line. All variations without f5 lead to Black losing too much material to keep on playing since the f6 square is so strong that Black will probably have to trade off his queen for my knight to prevent checkmate ( as the pawn on f7 can't be moved and Black will at most have the f8 square to retreat to after Qxh7. That simply gets met by Ba3 or Bg5 preparing to win the queen etc.

Nf6+ Qxf6 16. exf6 Rxe3 17. Bxe3 I'll get a rook against his knight in this variation but my pawn on f6 will be vulnerable and his knight has the possibility of becoming really strong on c4 or e4.

However this does cost him a little bit of time which I can use to reposition my rook on f1 and my questionable bishop on e3.

All it does is restrict me a little bit and prevent c4 which is of course important but I wouldn't go as far as saying that his knight is a monster knight. With this he also allows me to win the c7 pawn at the loss of 2 tempi. At this stage of the game 2 tempi shouldn't hurt me too much but it's definitely interesting.

Rd2 is played with the idea of playing Re2 which leads to checkmate after Re8+ Rxe8 Rxe8++. Of course that implies that Reuben doesn't take care of that threat in the future which he most likely will but my rook is better placed on e2 regardless.

I notice this and offer Reuben a solution in the form of playing Bd6 after which he plays his knight to d3 once more and then I move my bishop back as if nothing ever happened. He however declines this proposition. I suppose making mistakes like this and maybe look at how the opponent punishes these types of mistakes is educational in itself. I must say that I quite like the idea behind Nf4 though. The plan was probably to reroute the knight to e6 where it would target the bishop close the e-file and seperate my rook on e7 from my other rook that wants to go to e2. It's a shame that it doesn't quite work here but at least the thought process was pretty good.

I still have this opinion however with an entire rook up I'm confident in my ability to win any type of endgame and defend against his threats. Black simply doesn't have a lot of power left with solely his bishop and his rook. Of course White still needs to pay attention to backrank checkmates at this point in the game incase Rxc3 is played. However that aside I don't think that White has a lot to fear.

Let's say he plays g5 and I don't capture it then the following would happen. 32. Re8 g5 33. Rh8+ Kg6 34. Rag8+ Kxf6 and the king escapes. To prevent him from capturing the pawn on f6 I'll be forced to capture the pawn on g5 rather then immediately give check. After that he's forced to move his bishop away creating f5 as a flight square to avoid my checkmate threat. However his king will be in the middle of the map so even if I don't end up checkmating him just yet I can't see it ending well for Black. That being said I'll be very impressed if Reuben manages to find this as it's not that easy to spot.

I didn't play as well as I probably should have ( the bishop wich I didn't take is an example of this ) but I still played on a pretty decent level and Reuben fought a pretty good game. The highlight of the game was most definitely his defence to Nf6+ on move 15 and that move in itself is worthy of praise. I can definitely sense that he has improved at least a little bit since the last time we played and I'll be awaiting his future improvements. Maybe next time I'll take up the black pieces.

I think several of Black's key mistakes in this game were 1) move number twelve when he didn't take precautions against the King being pinned and I was able to gain myself a Rook and 2) leaving a lot of pieces unprotected and taking too many unnecessary risks. Like the knight on b4; that knight could have easily retreated to c6 but instead Black moved the other knight forward into my territory. That knight was protecting the key square at d6; if that knight hadn't moved last turn my queen wouldn't have been able to move to that square to check the king.

452,12,1,exf5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1B2pP2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Castling may be the leading move in the world database but I've learned that the R-L can be cramped if one does not stay proactive. Additionally with 5 O-O fxe4 Black can begin to dissolve away the centre and leave the board a mess. This opponent did similar with the Alekhine before they stumbled into a blunder field and handed Tips an easy victory. Not going to give Black that opportunity a second time! (Opportunity to leave the board a mess the opportunity to stumble into a blunder field I shall keep wide open! :) ) Finally I'm not sure Black is good enough to recover that pawn it just sacced with its choice of 4....Nf6. We'll soon find out! 
453,12,2,Ne7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppn1pp/5n2/1B2pP2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black relieves the pressure on its knight and makes a play at the errant pawn. Back in my wild gambiting days I learned if an opponent tried to retain the pawn gain it can oft tie itself into knots or over-extend its forces. White declines then Nxe5 (after some pause) as   Black would gain a knight pairing in exchange for White's 2 officers being far in front of the rest of its forces and a single pawn in material. Though admittedly Black would have no pawns operating forward of the 7th rank. None the less Nxe5 is ignored in a multitude of R-L lines for good reason and I'm unconvinced those reasons are sufficiently overturned in this novel opening. 
454,12,3,Qe2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppppn1pp/5n2/1B2pP2/8/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Instead then White chooses to continue with development territorial claims and aggression ....whilst also making it harder for Black to recover its gambited pawn (gambited is a word dammit). Yet White's forces are also beginning to link up instead of being over-extended. In the end with 6 games on the World database and 0 on the gameknot this is frontier R-L territory so time for Tips to trail blaze! (Especially  since this match is potentially eligible for the GK database! :) ) Allons-y!

In devising ways to counter I realised this gem possible due to the lavish tempo Black handed me with the (forced?) recapture of the gambited pawn and then the pre-castling move too early. Any advantages of clearing out the qside and putting Q and lcb on same diagonal are erased through the pressure about the e4 e5 and f6 squares that White is exerting. Piece coordination is the key to good chess and here the knight pairs d pawn Queen and dcb are all combining for some heavy pressure on the centre. With that pressure coming from knights Blacks better pawn structure is compromised and about to become a liability if Black is not careful. This is quickly becoming the R-L at its best; with quickly developed officers threatening to wreak havoc on Black's over-extended lines.

The downside for Black is that those knights will find it hard to co-ordinate so far away from each other. I had previously mentioned the essence of the R-L was to develop officers quickly then hit an over-extended line. 13 d4 then is perhaps the favoured line as gets the exchanges going. But this is an atypical R-L demonstrated by the fact White hasn't castled AND has the option of castling both sides. As such there are options aplenty: a4 threatening to push the Black knight into retreat B/Nh4 tempting an exchange O-O O-O-O Be3 h3 all beckon as White's lucky 13th move. Much analysis required! 
463,12,12,1O-O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp1q2pp/1npp2n1/4pbB1/2P1N3/1B1P1N2/PP2QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',"So why this out of all those vaunted possible moves? Well I could just use rmannstaedt's saying ""If in doubt scream and shout or alternatively castle."" :) But let's go through those options one by one.  ""a4 threatening to push the Black knight into retreat"" comment: why retreat a piece that can't move forward? Let it stay and act as a bulwark to its own forces. For in time those same defensive walls that provided shelter in the early middle can become the walls of an opponent's tomb by the late middle or endgame.""B/Nh4 tempting an exchange"" comment: my knight and bishop are co-ordinating and are threatening to a much greater extent than Black's knight on g4. Choosing to exchange here then would suit Black better than White.  Be3 exposed through analysis that Black could attack the backwards pawn on d3 with a doubling on the d file if allowed to castle long. Once that was exposed O-O-O or Rd1 became favoured over O-O. h4 was also tossed out on its arse for keeping the h3-g4 combo alive. Rd1 was ditched as I didn't want to move my rook off h1 meaning that putting the king (eventually) onto b1 was preferable to having it sandwiched betwixt the 2 rooks. O-O-O then provided needed support on the d file opening the possibility of pawn to d4 whilst allowing the king to get over and support the a pawn. Lots of analysis but necessary when you've got so many seemingly good moves. That concludes this lesson of how Tipsy uses the process of elimination to find the best of a seemingly good bunch. :)"

Now the bishop/knight's coordination shifts from money in the bank to money which needs to be spent. The f pawn needs to be freed up for an attack on e5 in turn releasing the d pawn from its box. Otherwise White can be cramped up. 
465,12,14,1Nh4,b'r3kb1r/pp1q2pp/1n1p2n1/2p1pbB1/2P1N2N/1B1P4/PP2QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',White invites an exchange setting up for g3-f4 but needs to be wary of cutting off the bishop's escape squares with its own pawn movements.

White considers g3-f4 sequence but: 17.g3 g5 and now White faces the exact same problem on the f4 square as it does on the d4. In addition White is looking cramped again. 
468,12,17,1Ng3,b'r3k2r/pp2q1pp/1n1p4/2p1pb2/2P5/1B1P2N1/PP2QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Instead White asks a little question of Black. With lines worked out for the g6 or Qf7/e6 support movements White is prepared to further simplify on the kside as its pawn majority on that side should be telling over time. Black can retreat the bishop but White has plans for that as well. In the very least a bishop retreat yields more space to White allowing it to finally uncoil on the kside. Not bad considering how cramped it looked previously. And of course there's always the chance Black will stuff things up completely in the coming set of exchanges/ensuing retreat though unlikely. They are playing with more poise this game it seems. 
469,12,18,1Bg6,b'r3k2r/pp2q1pp/1n1p2b1/2p1p3/2P5/1B1P2N1/PP2QPPP/2KR3R w kq -',Ah crap. So obsessed with the bishp retreating along the h3 diagonal I completely and utterly missed this glaringly obvious move. Kingside advancement is stalled and (I've just noticed) the checking diagonal is also open. Qc2 post haste for Ba4+ seems the order of the day emergency movement on the qside. Less drastic options involve Qe3 or something else. Returning the knight to it's previous position may also be an option tempo wasting as it is to avoid being hampered later in the game by that knight sitting in front of the pawns. 
470,12,19,1Ne4,b'r3k2r/pp2q1pp/1n1p2b1/2p1p3/2P1N3/1B1P4/PP2QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Well there's one thing now g4 is an option as Black has cut off g5. So if that move can be effected this hasn't all been for naught. 
471,12,20,Nb8,b'rn3rk1/pp2q1pp/3p2b1/2p1p3/2P1N3/1B1P2P1/PP2QP1P/2KR1R2 w - -',Hmmmm. I was certain Black had move their knight to d7 in order to get onto f5 and really exert some force around the centre-kingside. Since it seems unlikely they are manoeuvering to post their knight way out on a6 their goal may well be Nc6. From Nc6 it could leap to that troublesome d4 square. And a knight there could become a real knightmare! Ba4 is the reply if I believe 21...Nc6 is to be avoided. The downside for Black of their plan is the 3 movements of the same piece. In the 2 moves it will take to get their knight to its destination can I concoct a competent counterplay?  
472,12,21,2Ba4,b'rn3rk1/pp2q1pp/3p2b1/2p1p3/B1P1N3/3P2P1/PP2QP1P/2KR1R2 b - -',The answer is no. The end of the day I've been agitating for f4 so I can knock out the e5 pawn so I can advance the d pawn to catch the cat that ate the rat who chewed the fat in the house that Tipsy built! With Nc6 that entire plan goes south and the d pawn remains stymied. It's been a long time since ol Tips has seen an endgame; it has been a string of victories distilled from early or high middle games of late. In the last endgame I played it was a loss brought about by you guessed it a stymied backwards d pawn facing a very similar killing zone that we have here in this game. I will not allow some sneaky knight movement to condemn me to the same fate! (Incidentally there is also a potential trap here for Black but I'll discuss that if it looks like being set.) 
473,12,22,2a6,b'rn3rk1/1p2q1pp/p2p2b1/2p1p3/B1P1N3/3P2P1/PP2QP1P/2KR1R2 w - -',Ok but having set up for Nc6 Black was probably better continuing with their plans even though I had prepared for them. Here they might be manoeuvering for better pawn structure on the qside or perhaps they think I'll fall for 22...b5 23. cxb5 axb5 24. Bxb5 Ra2 but if so they are living in optimism.

Here it is being set (with a smaller snare already sprung) if 23. cxb5 axb5 24.Bxb5 Rxa2??? 25. Bc4!! and adios to Black's rook! (Admittedly the net gain in material will only be +2 after all that but the imbalance in rooks could well have great significance come the late middle or endgame.) The smaller snare is that Black has dropped a pawn with the 22...b5? movement. As previously mentioned Black would have been better off following through on their intended Nc6 movement as their 21st move. FINALLY Black has put a foot wrong. It is only a stumble but in such an even contest that little stumble might be all the yield I require to eventually cause Black to fall! 
476,12,25,d5,b'rn3rk1/4q1pp/6b1/1Bppp3/4N1Q1/3P2P1/PP3P1P/2KR1R2 w - -',Ah good move! So Black isn't going to give up 2 in material and leave a rook imbalance after all. 
477,12,26,Qb7,b'rn3rk1/1q4pp/6b1/1Bppp3/6Q1/2NP2P1/PP3P1P/2KR1R2 w - -',This is a delicate position: the knight on c3 is tasked with protecting both the a pawn and the bishop on b5. Yet it is vulnerable to a pawn on d4. Meanwhile Black has problems with the Qe6+ move that results in removal of the e5 pawn. Black has gone with a bold aggressive sequence of moves here to try and overload Tipsy's tactical ability. If this were an OTB position it would be spellbinding.

Mobility has been restored to the knight; a prize far more valuable than Black's e5 pawn. 

{For those playing at home these were the main lines analysed and my appraisal: 
26.	Qe6+	Bf7
27.	Qxe5	d4
28.	a4	dxc3
29.	bxc3	

Black is back to parity. 

26.	Qg5	d4
27.	Bc4+	Bf7
28.	Nb5	Bxc4
29.	dxc4	Nc6

White remains a pawn ahead. But the line is dull. 

26.	a4	Kh8
27.	f4	exf4
28.	Rxf4	

Far more interesting. White retains its pawn advantage. }"

Whilst the pawn movement setting up for an attack on the Bishop (28. gxf4) may look enticing introducing the immediate threat of mate with Rxf4 and again with 27. f4 exf4 28. Rxf4 Rxf4 29. Qxf4 puts Black under some mini pressure whilst also putting the Queen into a powerful position. By now if you've followed my games you'll realise my middle is all about continually asking questions of an opponent until they find themselves without an answer.

Magnificent! On the surface it may be hard to see counterplay for White. With this movement Black has exceptional piece coordination: look at how the knight is guarding c6 AND d7 the bishop f5 and how about that doubling up on the f-file? However when it comes to doubling  two can play that game (pun intended :) ) : 28. Qf3 is most enticing. Either way this has been a most enjoyable middle with more yet to come!

Their next move may reveal their error or they'll realise their mistake now too late and seek to mitigate. Given the aggressive nature of their previous moves unlikely! 
484,12,33,Qb7,b'rn3r1k/1q4pp/6b1/1BpN4/P2pPP2/6P1/1P2Q2P/2KR1R2 w - -',I was correct that Black would continue with their aggressiveness but they are simply opening up their position and allowing the material majority to take effect. White can roll up that kingside and ultimately wrap up the match. But first White may wish to connect the and b pawns (in turn connecting up the the bishop) to ensure there is way for Black to break through on the queenside.

And I have won so many times of late by asking a little question of the opponent; f5 achieves this b3 doesn't. But aside from hiccuping up some material through miscalculation of a sharp line Black has played with a more pronounced solidarity than our first meeting on the black and white battlefield. Indeed that hiccuping of material does serve as a reminder that aggression too early before one's pieces are all in position will undo even a savvy player. I can see no glaring flaw in f5 but I simply do not feel I am ready for kingside aggression that work needs to be done locking up the qside especially with so many of Black's heavies facing a comparatively thin White line. With 31 f5 Be8 32 Bxe8 even less material is left qside so for my own peace of mind the consolation before conquest.

The problem is the miscalculation may be mine. :P Back at 31. b3 by shoring up that queenside before going after the bishop I may have handed Black tempo which they used to get the knight into the c6 position: setting up for the powerful Ne5. Black has handed back the tempo with the need to move their bishop but now for example Qf3 places the queen in danger after Ne5 and suddenly tempo is handed back to Black as I move the queen twice in succession. The simple solution to this problem of course is 33.Bxc6 which 31.b3 makes possible. There are actually a lot of moves here for White this could prove the difference between consolidating that 2 in material and moving onto victory or Black returning to parity or worse. Time to think music....

490,12,39,3f6,b'r4r1k/5bpp/2q2P2/2pN4/P2pP3/1P4P1/4Q2P/2KR1R2 b - -',I did consider Qb5 here but there is no guarantee of an exchange and it drags the most powerful piece on the board away from both the centre and the site of action. Continuing on the mantra of exchanging all the way White virtually (by my calculations) forces a pair of exchanges here 34...Bxd5 35 exd5/fxg7+ (haven't decided which of those I prefer) causes exchanges all over the place! So now I'm happy with my 31.b3 move as I can leave my thin White line intact on the qside king safe as houses despite its seemingly open position whilst Black has to deal with all sorts of problems on the kingside as its seemingly solid fortress gets torn asunder. GOD I LOVE CHESS! :)

I forget pawns can avoid battle like that. :S Still I recently commented in one of Joe's annotations about pawns that can become satellites sitting high up in space unassailable they can ultimately win the war. The pawn on f6 could become most telling in the end game. So instead we'll concentrate on keeping the pawn on e4 in our hands.

Raise a glass ladies and gentleman this is attacking chess at it's best. I've had enough myself of playing it all with a straight bat (pun intended). Time to raise the stakes again I'll concede the discovered check and passed pawn on the 6th rank for ultimate positional and tactical gain. After a fair chunk of my Saturday spent on analysis I concluded that pawn will not promote. Black just doesn't have the material to get it over the line. We'll soon find out if I'm right! :)

495,12,44,Qc5,b'r4r1k/5b1p/5Pp1/2q5/P2RP3/1pN2QP1/7P/2K2R2 w - -',Well that was probably unexpected though it has been some time betwixt my last move and this annotation so I may have expected this and forgot about my reply!  With the inevitable 38...Qa3+ after I do something to ensure I don't lose my rook with my own 38th move Black is setting up to capture the h pawn it seems unless it tries to crack open the Qside that I am so sure is locked down. The interesting thing about this line is that maybe against normal chess theory I may want to encourage the Q on the 7th rank and falling upon my kingside pawns. Like a lobster trap perhaps once the Q ends up way over on the kingside and in my back rank it will find itself unable to come out the way it came in and thoroughly trapped!  
496,12,45,3Rd7,b'r4r1k/3R1b1p/5Pp1/2q5/P3P3/1pN2QP1/7P/2K2R2 b - -',Whilst I flirted with Qd3 this movement continues the aggressive trend of the late middle and also effectively forces Black into making the move I wanted them to move in the first place: Rxa4. Oh sure Black could still opt for the Qa3+ but the continuation that sees its Q taking the h pawn becomes even more fraught with danger than the lobster trap scenario posited earlier. Instead of containment round the Q instead White could focus on counterplay on Black's king and threaten to deal a mortal blow. White now has the game back on their terms instead of constantly reacting to Black's aggression. 
497,12,46,Rc4,b'5r1k/3R1b1p/5Pp1/2q5/2r1P3/1pN2QP1/3K3P/5R2 w - -', ...or not. I initially dismissed this line as trivial: superficially it looks like an empty threat from Black; if Black captures the knight it seems a pointless rook sac and Black goes to -4 in material.  However that is far from the truth.  (I'm on my ph so can't post my lines but why don't you give it a go? ) White is again forced into fighting withdrawal as I couldn't find any move other than Rd3 which didn't end in disaster! White  is slowly steadily being outplayed. But through luck they are still a pawn up. If White can get its King out of jeopardy and double or triple on the d file or force Black to simplify they may just fall over the line. If.

There are only many times he can sensibly decline the exchange or sensibly check the King before he actually is going backwards. That from a position where I believed Black was (slowly) outplaying White. 
502,12,51,Qa7+,b'6rk/q4b1p/5Pp1/8/2r1P3/1pNR2P1/3Q1K1P/5R2 w - -',Well case in point. Getting the K away from the hotseat seems the favoured course here and that pointless(?) check gives White a free move to sneak into g2 or f3 OR to once again face the Ladies off.

I have the bonus pawn but we shan't really count that for now as a recent consultation game in Tipsy's Place has shown that even a material of advantage of +4 can still result in a draw. 
504,12,53,Qe5,b'6rk/5b1p/5Pp1/4q3/2r1P3/1pNR2P1/3Q1RKP/8 w - -',Black is now simply electing to wheel and manoeuvre hoping to find a weakness or some unlikely way to promote its pawn. White can keep its pieces from denying Black this objective but at the same time will be so occupied in keeping Black at bay won't ever have the chance to mount an attack on Black's king or promote the f pawn. I said Black has generously played White back to parity from here I can't see either side being able to tip the scales. And so I might have to do what Tipsy seldom does. Offer a draw.

However it was a most engaging delightful game that had Tips harnessing all his chess powers just to stay in the game and on parity with his opponent. In the end that little mistake by Black was telling; doubtful I would have been able to force this into a drawn scenario had Black just one more pawn to play with! In particular I was pleased with my own ability though clearly at multiple times I overestimated the strength of my position once I felt the tide turning against me I was able to coordinate my pieces into a cohesive defence and resist the ocean itself. Great game! Bravo both sides!

So after capturing and he plays say 4...dxc6  Now the thing to worry about is a nasty pin with 5...Bg4 and after 6...Bxf3 7.Qxf3 without the N there 7...Qh4 and to prevent a nasty check 8.g3 would be indirectly forced in my opinion in which he has 8...Qxe4 losing a pawn.  Therefore I said I could've captured but then I lose something.  And he said ""aha!  Smart.  With a Bishop on c4 it would be dangerous to capture.""  I agreed by nodding my head."

He usually does but as noted it generally happens a move earlier.  But even when it doesn't this happens sooner or later.  One reason to allow it is that this allows him to develop his LSB safely without the loss of tempo.  In addition this is a center pawn so no matter how you look at it it is a developing move.

Develop a central so that my DSB can come into play without the loss of tempo since I won't be forced to fianchetto.  It wasn't easy to find this but after careful analysis I realize that this is the way to go as I did think about a fianchetto.  But after anticipating what is to come what I was thinking was in case of attack (which is between us going to happen on his eighth move) I need b3 so no fianchetto.  In other words there just isn't time to do it.  With what unfolds I realize that I made the right decision.

In addition Jack also taught and gave me some good variations which I knew he would being that he's an epic coach.  In it he played through it by saying ""Very good.  Much better then 9.Bxf6 because after 9...Qxf6 I can play 10...Nd4 and after 11.Nxd4 Bxd4 f2 becomes a target with my Q+DSB""  Like before I agreed by nodding my head especially because I recently learned from tactical-abyss that f2 for white and f7 for black are the weakest squares.  And allowing the opponent to target could spell disaster.  In most of his Q sac examples where he gives up his Q for a P Joe still wins because he does it on the weakest square.  The opponents think that they have won with nothing to worry about but the harsh reality is that there is still little to no room for error because that square is now target.  So if you let your guard down it can mean disaster.  And yes this is something I taught one of my students when her opponent not only didn't develop her pieces but she also her opponent to target the weakest square resulting in mate.  "

But everything starting now makes that difference because of a concept which a GK friend introduced me to.  That ""What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the midgame will affect you in the endgame; and what you do in the endgame will affect the final results""  Although were in the midgame it still makes a big difference.

Although one could classify it as one of the bad bishops as well as the others (given that both are semi blocked by his pawns); a bad bishop in this context isn't really bad.  That's the way tipsyjourneyman puts it.  In this position his LSB is quite dangerous and I'm thinking about what he might be very capable of doing with it because what if my coach for example decides to pin my f3 N with it.  The reason that's important is due to the fact that then Be2 isn't possible and even if so he can still after exchanging on e2.  So due to this I exchange it first.  But when he takes back...

But now there's more to the story then originally stated.  The idea being is that this adds an important defender to f2.  When I played that he said ""Aha you smelled that.""  And I said Yes I did."

I think that Jack made the right decision because two R's on one file is known to be dangerous.  In fact that was something he taught me and made me study one position as Homework.  That was because he got an overwhelming attack against me by allowing to double up on one file.  So in this context yes I was trying to use his advice against him.  But I am not surprised at the fact that it doesn't work since he is the coach and therefore knows what's really going on.
534,13,25,1Qg6,b'r4rk1/2p3p1/p2pp1qp/1p2p2n/3bP2B/2NP4/PPPQRPPP/5RK1 w - -',I almost overlooked the threat as I have before.  In fact at the time probably about a year and a half or two years ago we had a similar position with the same threat.  And he played something like this.  At the time I viewed it as pointless and figured that he waisted his time and that this would be the time where I'd play something and get the advantage.  Compare it to last time and it would be the equivalent to say 17.Be7 threatening to take his R.  So he then responded to obviously what's the equivalent to 17...Nf4 forcing me to lose my Q for a N were I to avoid mate.  So the response was equal to 18.Bxf8 in which he did have 18...Qxg2#  By the equivalent to I don't mean it was played as the position was different.  In fact I couldn't even remember what the exact position was but it was very comparable to this position.  So what I'm doing is comparing the positions and mentioning how I overlooked that threat and since then what I've learned.  With that being said I wasn't going to overlook this threat.  Therefore as you might expect I asked myself what I can do.

In other words I had no choice but to open up which makes sense because he has told me that sometimes opening up is the only way to avoid mate as the K needs ""Air to breathe.""  This is the perfect example."

But after the game Tom (who came in just a few minutes ago) Jack and I reviewed it.  As he pointed out this loses right away.  When we analyzed it I realized that this was quite similar to a position I had in my last loss against jstevens1 which was actually my second to last game against her.  I had a similar pin but then I made a mistake allowing her K to move and when she did I was lost.  That's because when she eliminated a pin like this by moving her K I was left in a fork.  And with that being said my K had to move.  Therefore 18.Kh1 was forced.  Like with that game loss not only would the pin have been broken this would also leave his R attacked.  Which when all is said would have given me tempo.  What he said and I forget was that in the next few moves he could win a pawn.  After being my own spectator I realized that it isn't so and that with gain of time I just might have a small edge.   But with this move I am hopelessly lost.

Not this time for had it been simple greed I wouldn't have played it after what I learned.  The problem is and was especially here that in OTB Chess there is no analyze the board.  And I knew that once he moved his N Jack would have a discovered check.  But what I thought was that his discovered check would however. be mate.  So as far as I was considered I was preventing a mate in one.  By looking at the board (in the aftermath with analyze the board) I realize that this isn't so.  In fact much better was to allow it.  Not exactly sure what I should've played but something like 19.b4 came into consideration allowing him to do that.  Yes this would've prevented that.  However against my coach it would still be lost because I would lose a piece immediately and two or three pieces in a few moves.  So needless to say that as jstevens1 I would face ""ruinous loss of material""  But that is better then what is to come as now mate is inevitable. "

Thinking that I had gotten some counterplay I played 20.fxg3 which was taken.  That's because Jack and Tom accurately pointed out that taking would be an illegal move.  What I overlooked is that in addition to the g pawn my f pawn was also pinned so that I could not capture there.  With that being said this is forced.
540,13,31,2Qh3+,b'r5k1/2p1B1p1/p2pp2p/1p2p3/3bPr2/2NP3q/PPPQRP2/5R1K w - -',Seeing that he will mate on g4 after only having one square for my K I resign.  Now in the end I learned something important.  First Tom said something that he said a while ago which is why I stopped annotating OTB games sometime ago.  But seeing how good Jack is not to mention that he is famous as I posted a lot about him they asked me to annotate the game.  Now in order to make the annotation I had notate and record the position.  But Tom said that one lesson was that I needed to stop writing things down so that I could concentrate on the actual game.  Jack agreed by nodding his head.  Normally I would to but easy19 who is currently a master and therefore has a higher ranking said that it is good to record.  That people have been notating games whether tourney or not for over 100 years.  And that doing this is good for you.  Consequently I believe it or not agree with him.  But after this game I played against Tom in which I didn't notate.  Yet I made the same mistake against so the same move (Kh1 was must.)  Although it was a different position he was threatening mate with two of the same pieces.  In fact my coach said that he has seen this in a couple of my games and he's seen is only OTB games.  With that being said this mistake has also been made in a few of my games on this website so the moral is very important.  Having said that the real lesson to be learned is that in certain circumstances where your opponent threatens mate on the castled side with his or her Q+R you must move your K to the corner.  By that he means on the a or h files and on it's homesquare (so on the same rank where the K is initially placed.)  Doing that will stop the threat because those pieces won't be able to barge in and cause damage as they did here.  Therefore this is an important part of King Safety as Jack put it.

I'm considering kingside castling if I can drive away the queen at this point but in retrospect the kingside is terribly exposed if black can mount a counter challenge.

720,19,36,2Bc6#,b'4kb1r/4npp1/p1B4p/q4P2/2p1Q1PP/8/PP6/2KR4 b - -',A neat checkmate. The king is blocked in by his own pieces the knight is pinned and the rook controls the open file. A nice game from me I think.

728,20,7,e4,b'2k5/ppp5/3p3p/8/4p1K1/1NPn3P/PP6/8 w - -',To be honest I am not good at endgame. Both white and black want to advance pawns on h3 and e4 respectively.
729,20,8,3Kg4,b'2k5/ppp5/3p3p/8/3Np1K1/2P2n1P/PP6/8 b - -',I think this was white's big mistake. He had to hold black's pawn with his knight while advancing the pawn on h column with king.

Not only does he lose his bishop for a knight which is not usually a good trade but he also allows me to bring a pawn into the middle and it opens the b file for my rook.

829,26,0,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',One of the best countering my usual attack. 
830,26,1,c3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',My intention is not to play c4 contrary to the normal play. But I had no need to compromise to it right now. Nd4 preparing e4 (if d5 is not payed) would have been a slightly better. 
831,26,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',Giving me a second chance to try e4.
832,26,3,Nbd2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I go for it. Now he can stop me with d5. He can also  exchange my dsb by Ng5.
833,26,4,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ c6',A good player will do the right thing. This is a very good  move. I don't think taking the pawn will be good. I won't be able to stop e5 later. 
834,26,5,e3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I'm not forced to play e4. I have attack lines from here too. 
835,26,6,exd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',He is a move behind using the white squares but I can. Of course If I'd studied theory all this must find familiar. I'm not on the GK db and to look around is something I rarely allow myself to spend time on. I'm not a good student I know :-)
836,26,7,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Black doesn't bo for d5. Is he planning to fianchetto the lsb?
837,26,8,Qb3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',I think the only sensible move for black is Nc6 preparing Na5 in case of Bc4-Ng5. 
838,26,9,Nh5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/7n/3P1B2/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Hard decision. Be3 seems good but this will allow e5 and the Bg7 will be very strong. 
839,26,10,Bg3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/7n/3P4/1QP2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Maybe wrong. I planned to live with NxB hxN. 
840,26,11,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P4/1QP2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ e6',I though that after dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 black had Re8 and it was difficult to be sure I could save it. This was blitz. 
841,26,12,1Bh4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P3B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',So I decided to come with this surprise. Black can't interpose a piece ot it will be pinned for a move. He must move the Q. 
842,26,13,1Qc7,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P3B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Good defending f7 and threatening to open too soon the c column (before I castle).
843,26,14,1d5,b'rnb2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/7B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',I intended to play a surprise move. I'm giving up the useful pin on the f pawn and now he can play a pawn storm on my kingside. But this considerably losens the strenght of his dsb. The pin model is still on: if black plays e4 and I dare Nxe4 Re8 will lose me a minor piece. 
844,26,15,1Nd7,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/7B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',"I'd say ""?"". He should have definitely played e4. "

846,26,17,1Nf4,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/5n1B/1QP2N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I have a strategy that is to try to make mistakes appear as intentional. This sometimes lead to good sacs. But this time I just sensed that I could find no advantage by it and the best was to admit my mistake and humbling defend. 
847,26,18,1Bf1,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/5n1B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',"Ugly. And I am aware I will suffer now a strong attack against d3. I have to open a ""zen umbrella"". "

849,26,20,1Qd1,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/2nPpb2/5n1B/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',A tempo lost. Still black has to prove his win. 
850,26,21,1Ncd3+,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/5n1B/2Pn1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The idea could be to allow Qc4 at some point. Otherwise the attack is just premature. 
851,26,22,1Bxd3,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/5n1B/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I lose control of the white squares but his Q is not in yet. 
852,26,23,1Ke2,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/7B/2Pn1N2/PP1NKPPP/R2Q3R b - -',Ok let's play around. You've won a pawn ok. You can't play Qc4. You can play Bg5 but h3 and the exchage helps me to losen the pressure. Black has still work to do. 
853,26,24,1Qb3,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/7B/1QP2N2/Pn1NKPPP/R6R b - -',"Accepting Bd3+ Ke1. The ""zen"" defence. "
854,26,25,1Nd3,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/7B/1QPn1N2/P2NKPPP/R6R w - -',This instead surprised me. f2 is defended and my dsb is safe. It is guarding against any Bh6 black idea until the Nf3 supports it and if e4 Ng5 and it still has Ne6 stopping f6 and in case of h6 Nxe4. Not bad...
855,26,26,1Rhd1,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/7B/1QPn1N2/P2NKPPP/R2R4 b - -',I thought about Ra-b1 pressing b7 but I felt that I must be prepared to retreat the K on f1 without being closing in my own R. So I put it here with a shadow of a pressure on 3 that will help later. 
856,26,27,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/7B/1QPn1N2/P2NKPPP/R2R4 w - -',"Black threatens c3 and I can't defend it. I didn't see it coming I admit it. On the other side it was difficult to find something better. But I had to defend. The ""zen defence"" was called for again..."

I was almost sure that allowing the Q to survive would have brought me some mate with N Q and B. I wasn't sure then and I won't be sure until the game will be published so I'll see it through the board. I just decided not to risk and hold the storm. 
862,26,33,2Be7,b'5rk1/pp2Bpbp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/2r2n2/2P2N2/P4PPP/RN1R1K2 b - -',Ok I played this last card I had. My lsb's weird position at last found some justification.

868,26,39,2Raxb1,b'2r3k1/pp3pbp/3B2p1/3Pp3/2r2n2/2P2N2/P4PPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',e4 now is still good but white can escape via Ne5 and Rxb7 is threatened so there is still game to go. Black should have considered the strenght of his pawn's mayority on the Kside and play f6. White doesn't have any lsb to harm trough the white squares and c3 can't be defended so there is no hurry in taking it. 
869,26,40,2Rc4xc3,b'2r3k1/pp3pbp/3B2p1/3Pp3/5n2/2r2N2/P4PPP/1R1R2K1 w - -',Now I have two chances of compensate the pawn. e5 is the more dangerous by far (note that the black diagonal is now empty so black' dsb is half that powerful. Still e4 can be annoying. On the other side Rxb7 offers a very nice control of the 7th. Black will have the same control of the second row in any case. I shouldhave palyed a defensive move like Rd2 but I felt far more important...
870,26,41,2Nxe5,b'2r3k1/pp3pbp/3B2p1/3PN3/5n2/2r5/P4PPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Ok right pawn... right piece? I didn't really want to force the dsb's exchange anymore. Now mine is stronger than his (I could consider myself a very good defender and a very nice strategist... :-). I thought in threatening Nxf7 without seeing Ne2+ as the in-between saving move for black. This is the sad truth!
871,26,42,2b6,b'2r3k1/p4pbp/1p1B2p1/3PN3/5n2/2r5/P4PPP/1R1R2K1 w - -',As I hoped black took care of his weakness but Rc2 at once would have been far more aggressive and better.

873,26,44,3Kxe2,b'2r5/p4kbp/1p1B2p1/3P4/8/2r5/P3KPPP/1R1R4 b - -',I am not down ok but I exposed my K for a pawn when a piece was given to me.

Anyway this move is better than the tempting Rd2. I have to be aware that this R is guaranteeing me the Bg3 retirement by defending the d pawn. It can't be compromised in an exchance or d - and the game - will be lost. So this apparently bad move I think was sound.

As for the pawn's defence my R are now misplaced. d1 and e1 would have been their best places but the reasons that lead me to bring Rh1 into the game were valid I think.

The reason I didn't is because of what ION noted in a previous annotation against Jack that even though it's technically even 3.Nxe5 Nxe4 gives black tempo.  Losing time so early would give the opponent a slight advantage and my goal is to make it difficult for her until Jack comes.  So with that being said I made the decision to defend e4 at once as now the threat is back.  Now it's important to note that I am coaching her so if Jack wasn't there things would be different and I'd be tougher.  With the main coach I often go wrong and Jack helps her find the way to exploit my mistakes.  So I end up losing but that's allright because this is how she and I learn which is what I actually care about.  It is what we used to have or what you sometimes see in an annotation.  So in other words you do give advice and teach but then Jack looks it over to ascertain that I'm giving the correct information and when I'm wrong he asks what is wrong and finds a better move that would often show why I'm wrong.

The problem is that I don't analyze quiet as carefully in OTB chess and therefore miss an important detail.  And had I not would've pointed this out but this is an inaccuracy because the leaves her with a bad bishop.  Instead I would've played 3...Bc5 and then this would be played.  But with this move...
890,27,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',"I will treat it as if we were in the French or Caro Kann Defense.  The idea being in an opening is that when black advances a pawn one square forward you respond by playing d4.  Now it is as ION has said which is that if it works in that position you play what you're most comfortable with.  This is something that Susan Polgar implied when she said that you don't try to memorize moves in an opening but rather play what you're comfortable with.  And yes as archduke_piccolo has said the only thing to be weary of are the small changes which could invalidate my thought process.  But I asked myself if there was a change which would result in negative consequences.  When I determined that it wouldn't that's when the decision was made to move here.

So this was the first time where I correct her and yes this is where I learned from that certain someone that I moved on.  And the only reason I dare mention is the fact that it's important to apply what you've learned and use it towards your games as shamash puts it.  In fact that is the main reason that I have now reached my highest rating and think I'm still improving.  On that note I said to Mary the only problem is that the Knight is crammed is on d7.  A better square is on c5 and she agreed by nodding her head.   (When I said c5 what I really meant was c6 so I gave the wrong info there by reversing my colors which is why I abhor that.)  The reason I stated this is that in applying what I learned as noted in a game I remember quite well I made a mistake that forced me to place in on the second rank as white; which is the same as the seventh rank for black.  Then I made another which forced the other N on the same rank which gave him much better center control.  From then on things went quickly downhill as I was now going to face ruinous loss of material or get mated.

The idea being is the fact that she will now have to waist tempo to get her LSB into place.  I also kept in mind that she has a bad bishop.  So between those two factors I realize that my center is better controlled as of the moment and I'm ahead in development.  Therefore I have a slight advantage for now.

That's because black could and most likely would answer with the immediate 6...b5  I was worried about the loss of a piece though I realize that 7.Bb3 would've kept it safe.  But I don't like the placement as well as here.  The idea being is that I have protection.

Normally I'd retreat but given that I'm doing a little coaching with Mary I want to see what she's going to do later on since I don't fully know what she's up to as it's been a while since I've played against her.  Had I known what was to follow later on I would've retreated.

And although I didn't say anything I agree.  Although it isn't development per say I think her K will be safer when she decides to castle.  Normally I would know for sure except that id=tactical-abyss said that having two pawns opened around the K doesn't necessarily make it unsafe.  It all depends on the position.  But I am not sure what would've happened here that is had she played 11...gxf5 but I like this move a lot better.

The reason for this move is that I have previously learned that one way you control the center is by bringing the R on a center square.  But in this position it is an absolute blunder that now puts me a disadvantage because of what's about to occur.  With that being said this is also why I should've retreated as opposed to exchanging her B for my N.  Had I don't that her next move wouldn't have been feasible because my DSB would've prevented her Q from coming to f6.

As now I Jack is focusing on his game against Perry which believe it or not he also loses against his student with one mistake which he thought was a win.  And she is doing so well that I won't give much advice from here on because it's not good to overteach.  So we're heading towards the end of it.  Mary: I can put you in check.  Joe: Yes and you've won a piece.  I said that with a smile on my face as I'm impressed with her play as she has become better.  And as ION noted she is starting to get used to tactics as we will see later on.
906,27,20,1Kh1,b'r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2pp3p/2n4b/3qP3/2NB1P2/PPP3PP/R2QR2K b kq -',So I had two choices to move the K.  It was either on f1 or here.  The reason I decided to play 13.Kh1 is because what I learned from Jack last week.  That part of K safety is that on certain occasions you have to move your K to the corner to prevent threats as that's part of K safety.  Although it's not immediate a threat could allume as I've seen in positions similar to this.

And I agree as this how I've always felt by saying that he's the best.  She nodded.  Now had Jack not said that Mary I forget what move she would make.  But it would've been something which I believe would've gotten her into trouble possibly losing the advantage as black must be careful here.

That moving the pawn and opening it up near the K isn't always a bad thing and won't necessarily expose it.  So I decide to follow a technique that ION used against Ron when he was losing and things were looking worse.  He just got aggressive and when Ron made one mistake it was over.  Well I'm trying to do the same thing for.  In this case it's just getting aggressive knowing as I'm doing anything for counterplay.  I'm pretty sure that I'm going to lose not just due to being a piece down but for the reason outlined earlier.  So my goal is to make things difficult for Mary so that she has a difficult time defeating me.  Putting up a tough fight is also a way for her to learn.

Nontheless she's becoming good at this game and showing progress which is something I like.  And although I have coached her before the main reason is really because of Jack as first he's why I have improved.  And the fact is that he's worked with her much more.  In fact he coaches her most of the time I'd say 9 out of 10 times and that 10% where he does is with the consulation games like this; where I coach and he helps her defeat me with advise.

She really starts to think about how to get out of this which is what I want.  The idea being that you become better by thinking and struggling and it's worth noting that it's also how I've improved and a little of what it takes for me to come up with my own variations.  Since I want her becoming familiar with the same concept I decide to give her the equivalent of homework by putting her in this situation.  It is part of getting her to become familiar with those forcing moves which is also the cornerstone to thinking like a GM which is what I learned by Susan Polgar during the e-mail course.  With that being said while thinking about it Jack helps by saying ""You only have one move.  Make the wrong one and you're in trouble.""  I nodd because what he's really implying is that if Mary doesn't find the response I will recompensate (equalize) and from there will have the intiative."

And I am so hyperfocused on helping Mary learn that I don't see her plan which is bound to become deadly.  In doing so however I did achieve my goal.  If I did care about winning I wouldn't have but she does really think on moves when she was in trouble which is what I really wanted.

For the most part so 95% of it was Flip Coin Chess.  I didn't do it just to win another pawn though that was 5% of the reason.  However the main reason was that now I was thinking in long terms of how I'd promote with the d pawn.  So what I was anticipating was that she'd take back with 22...bxc6 and then I would keep advancing my d pawn with Q behind since that's the passer.  The idea behind it was that I was thinking from studying some of those other endgames how to promote.  I realized that I'd never be able to keep that second Q but then I would recompensate and get a R.  But I didn't take enough time to analyze the immeidate threat which is why it was Flip Coin Chess.  Therefore this was a terrible oversight as I overlooked what's about to happen.  Instead I had to move my N to prevent that after which she would take and now I'd be down by the equivalent to a piece and two pawns without compensation.

After this game Jack and I were also both impressed with Mary's play and we agree that she is becoming a strong player.  This makes us proud of her because it shows how much she is learning from the training sessions which accomplishes his and my goals.  Right after this game Mary and I played another game with me as black which I didn't notate but this time I won.  The idea was the same where I coached and Jack gave advice so it was another consultation game.  But seeing how much better Mary has become I wasn't going to be a Mr. nice guy this time around.  Yet Jack pointed out a blunder I made which allowed her to win a piece early.  However I recompensated by winning three pawns in return.  Afterwards she made a mistake and allowed me to win a piece.  Shortly after that we had to put everything because it was already noon so Mary and I had to leave.  As a result it was assumed that I won due to the advantage that I had.  "

I wasn't feeling like playing defensive here with 6...d6 and though I could put some pressure on white. It may be too much a prey to bite. Both sides are underdeveloped but black as said has no strong castling to go for. Also in case Nf6 moves check in h5 would be annoying. Therefore after 7.cxd5; Nxd5. 8.Qd1 (seems a wasted time but definitively forces black to go for the long castling) forces a pawn race on opposite wings.

I was aiming to put some pressure on the king to avoid any happy leap from WN in f3 (followed by Bf3 saying a pawn for attack on my castling). Too big a plan maybe sort of paranoid. Maybe Rg8 was stronger (and safer!)

After gxf3 Bxf3 gives good chances to white (I'd say the game). Now the plan is either the mentioned Rh7 (and hopefully along the Queen) or Q to the ""h"" file. It may take too long though. Maybe Re1 would be a releasing one better than Rc1."

964,29,7,cxd5,b'b1r2rk1/2n1q2p/p5p1/1pNpp3/1P6/P3P3/1BQ2PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',Poorly played by White.  Now Black's central pawn mass is more effective.

After Qxc7 White can play Rxd5 but Black has the annoying Qc2 attacking the hanging B on b2.  White's Q is overloaded and can't guard the d5 R the b2 B the e4 N and the back rank threat of Qb1+ all at the same time.  
966,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am not surprised to see white play this.
967,30,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Although it is very common this is the first time that I have seen Joe play the French Defense in Blitz Chess.  The rest is pretty standard but since he is black TA sacs on f2.  You will note that f pawn right near the homesquare is it's weakest square on the chess board.  So what I am alluding to as I have no better way of explaining this is f2 for white and f7 for black.
968,30,2,Bd6,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3bp3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP1BKPP/RNBQ2NR w kq -',But after the sac TA goes back to development.  The idea is seeing if the opponent can beat him.  In general it doesn't but Joe does tests his opponent because the idea being is that with best play his opponent should win so there's a bit to learn.  However despite being a Q down with the pawn on the weakest square removed so that is f2 there is little to no room for error.  So if white makes mistakes it would still be lights out for him which as usual is going to happen.
969,30,3,h3,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3bp3/8/4P3/3P3P/PPP1BKP1/RNBQ2NR b kq -',Instead of advancing a flank white should use the time to develop his pieces and get his K safety.  In fact that is one of the things that Joe evaluates.  
970,30,4,Ne7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppnppp/3bp3/8/4P3/3P3P/PPP1BKP1/RNBQ2NR w kq -',But Joe does not waist time in doing so.  In fact in one of his lectures TA said that after sacking he will just continue developing for the most part.  And what was implied is something that archduke_piccolo said that if his opponent fails to do so his pieces will be better coordinated which would be used for a devastating attack.  Not exactly sure how to explain but the idea being is that pieces can work together to play a powerful role.  A perfect example was my last game against Ted where I had a powerful Bishop pair despite still having 15 pawns left which you don't see too often.  
971,30,5,Bg5,b'rnb1k2r/ppppnppp/3bp3/6B1/4P3/3P3P/PPP1BKP1/RN1Q2NR b kq -',This however develops.  But Joe has a plan with his next move.
972,30,6,f6,b'rnb1k2r/ppppn1pp/3bpp2/6B1/4P3/3P3P/PPP1BKP1/RN1Q2NR w kq -',The idea being that after white retreats black will use that time to castle whereas white is forced to waist time by retreating which means that his DSB is forced to move twice.
973,30,7,c3,b'rnb2rk1/ppppn1pp/3bpp2/8/4P2B/2PP3P/PP2BKP1/RN1Q2NR b - -',I don't know why white played this.  But in my opinion he is now starting to run into trouble.  That's because with black's next move he will have another piece out.  So he will only have one piece undeveloped whereas white will have two.
974,30,8,Bg3,b'r1b2rk1/ppppn1pp/2nbpp2/8/4P3/2PP2BP/PP2BKP1/RN1Q2NR b - -',?! I understand that white wants to exchange.  But I don't see the point.  Not only is he moving the same piece again as opposed to developing another piece but white's DSB is a good bishop whereas black's is a bad bishop as Joe's DSB cannot retreat to the 7th rank.  That's because it's blocked by his c pawn and N on e7.
975,30,9,f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppppn1pp/2nbp3/5p2/4P3/2PP2BP/PP2BKP1/RN1Q2NR w - -',In this position Joe's plan is to get a passed pawn by exchanging pawns on the f file.  As right now there is no passer due to white's pawn on e4 but if they exchange there white won't have a pawn next to black's pawn.  So things will change.
976,30,10,1Bxd6,b'r1b2rk1/ppppn1pp/2nBp3/5p2/4P3/2PP3P/PP2BKP1/RN1Q2NR b - -',For the reason mentioned earlier which is that white gives up his good DSB for black's DSB I wouldn't have played.  I also would not take on f5 because black would have a passed pawn as noted a move ago.  Instead I would've played 10.d4 which will give black more time and as we know tempo is very important.  So for example 10.d4 e4 (to prevent 11.e4 as white would lose a piece as his DSB is locked in) 11.d5 and now Joe would be to forced to protect his N with whites pawn chain. 
977,30,11,1fxe4+,b'r1b2rk1/ppppn1pp/2nBp3/8/4p3/2PP3P/PP2BKP1/RN1Q2NR w - -',Instead of taking back right away he takes and gets a nasty discover check in return.  I like this better as he does compensate first.  And although white has a noticeable I think it's fading away.  That's because we're not just looking at compensation but now white's K is starting to become exposed.  
978,30,12,1Kg3,b'r1b2rk1/ppppn1pp/2nBp3/8/4p3/2PP2KP/PP2B1P1/RN1Q2NR b - -',One of the reasons I said that is because of what black is going to play next.
979,30,13,1Kh2,b'r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2nBp3/5n2/4p3/2PP3P/PP2B1PK/RN1Q2NR b - -',First black will exchange and get a piece back.  But suppose that weren't so Joe now has a better structure.  So while material wise white has the edge I think that in general it's even.  When I say that what's important to note is that you don't base things solely on material.  For example just because it's even (so the score is 0 doesn't mean it's a draw.)  And being a pawn or two up doesn't=a win.  For instance there was another game where material wise it was even but one side had a forced win regardless.  And resignation from the other wasn't premature as there was an inevitable mating in that position.
980,30,14,1Nf3,b'r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2n1p3/8/4n3/2P2N1P/PP2B1PK/RN1Q3R b - -',At last white develops another piece.  But with what happened it can't be concluded but I'm afraid it's already too little too late as despite only having one piece undeveloped black has much more control of the center then his opponent.  In addition with that being said Joe is going to get in addition to what he's compensated for a R for N with a nasty fork. And I think that it is due to his control of the center.
981,30,15,d6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/2npp3/8/8/2P2N1P/PP1QB1P1/RN5K w - -',That is proven here as now not only has he developed a center pawn; but even with the bad B he can still bring it to d7.  And if ever ...e5 that would change into being a good B.
982,30,16,1Na3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/2npp3/8/8/N1P2N1P/PP1QB1P1/R6K b - -',Completing development but the problem is black's structure compared to his which is still why I believe that it's too little too late for white.  In other words even though it's true Joe maintains better control of the center.
983,30,17,1a6,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3pp/p1npp3/8/8/N1P2N1P/PP1QB1P1/R6K w - -',To prevent the pesky 18.Nb5 or 18.Bb5
984,30,18,1Bd3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3pp/p1npp3/8/8/N1PB1N1P/PP1Q2P1/R6K b - -',Putting pressure on h6.  His idea is to get that h pawn and put black in a difficult situation.
985,30,19,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/1ppb2pp/p1npp3/8/8/N1PB1N1P/PP1Q2P1/R6K w - -',But Joe waists no time in completing development.  And like I said earlier despite being behind (material wise) I like black's position better.
986,30,20,1Ng5,b'r4rk1/1ppb2pp/p1npp3/6N1/8/N1PB3P/PP1Q2P1/R6K b - -',That threat becomes a little more obvious however.
987,30,21,1h6,b'r4rk1/1ppb2p1/p1npp2p/6N1/8/N1PB3P/PP1Q2P1/R6K w - -',But black stops it.  Now I thought that white had alternatives but the verdict is that he must run back.  I was thinking along the lines of 20.Bh7+ Kh8 as there appears to be pressure on black's K.  However after black brings the K to h8 Joe would win another another piece.  So white obviously makes the right choice.
988,30,22,Rf6,b'r5k1/1ppb2p1/p1nppr1p/8/8/N1PB1N1P/PP1Q2P1/R6K w - -',At first I wasn't sure why this was played but now it makes perfect sense.  And with that being said I also would've moved here because Joe intends to and will double up on his next move.
989,30,23,2Qc2,b'r5k1/1ppb2p1/p1nppr1p/8/8/N1PB1N1P/PPQ3P1/R6K b - -',Coming up with what appears to be a threat on h7.  However it is not because as we're about to see Joe will allow that.  The idea being is that doubling up is very useful and often known to give you and advantage.  As noted before I won a Q early against Jack but he was able to compensate due to a horrible mistake from me which allowed him to double up similar to this.  The same thing happened when I coached a student lost my Q early but made a mistake that allowed me to double and get a passed pawn.  Those two things were what proved to be a killer.  With that being said black now has the advantage because doubling up is known to be dangerous and with a R missing from white he won't be able to do it.  That gives black more dangerous threats against white then one might think.
990,30,24,Kh8,b'5r1k/1ppb2pB/p1nppr1p/8/8/N1P2N1P/PPQ3P1/R6K w - -',Not to mention that Joe has placed his K in the corner.  And remember the moral from my last annotation against Jack Stockel.  The lesson being that with nasty threats or something like this the K needs to be in the corner as it's part of K safety because it prevents other nasty threats and gets you out of trouble.  With that being said black is now safe whereas white has a bit to worry about.
991,30,25,2Nh4,b'5r1k/1ppb2pB/p1nppr1p/8/7N/N1P4P/PPQ3P1/R6K b - -',In this position white intends to win a R for white's B with a double check followed by his remaining B for free and if this happens white would get the advantage.  In fact while I can't conclude knowing what Joe teaches I think it would be an easy win from then on.  The threat is of course 24.Ng6+ Kxh7 25.Nxf8+ Kg8 (because if 25...Kh8?? 26.Qh7#) 26.Nxd7 
992,30,26,2Ne5,b'5r1k/1ppb2pB/p2ppr1p/4n3/7N/N1P4P/PPQ3P1/R6K w - -',! But this is what I also would've played as Joe stops the threat cold because if 24.Ng6+ 24...Nxg6 25.Bxg6 and black doesn't lose anything else as recapturing afterwards would be blunder since black would now get a R for B.
993,30,27,2Be4,b'5r1k/1ppb2p1/p2ppr1p/4n3/4B2N/N1P4P/PPQ3P1/R6K b - -',Seeing that it would be pointless to take white turns his attention to b7 pawn as it is vulnerable.
994,30,28,2Rf6f2,b'5r1k/1ppb2p1/p2pp2p/4n3/4B2N/N1P4P/PPQ2rP1/R6K w - -',So as I see with GM games as well as ones from charleshiggie Joe fights back by reattacking.
995,30,29,2Qb3,b'5r1k/1ppb2p1/p2pp2p/4n3/4B2N/NQP4P/PP3rP1/R6K b - -',But b7 is what white still wants.
996,30,30,2Rf2f4,b'5r1k/1ppb2p1/p2pp2p/4n3/4Br1N/NQP4P/PP4P1/R6K w - -',So Joe answers with this move.  Given that white is in a nasty fork I would not know what to do in this position.  But kavayah1 finds a way out of it as this is ineffective.  And I am not saying that black waisted time at all for this is quite good since it defends b7 since black has found a way out of trouble.  However white finds a way out of it with his next move.  After which the N's are exchanged in which black will protect the b pawn once and for all.
997,30,31,2Nc2,b'5r1k/2pb2p1/pp1pp1Bp/8/5r2/1QP4P/PPN3P1/R6K b - -',I am not sure why white played.  But this time it is safe to say it as I don't see a danger in a move I'm thinking about.  And with that being said I would've played 28.Nc4 which is a better outpost for his N.  The idea being is that it is semi cramped on c2 meaning this is not a comfortable square for him.  And after say 28...d5 my next move would be 29.Ne5  If however 28...b5 then I would answer with 29.Ne3
998,30,32,2a5,b'5r1k/2pb2p1/1p1pp1Bp/p7/5r2/1QP4P/PPN3P1/R6K w - -',Getting a pawn chain and black has a plan to go after white's Q again as we will see later on.
999,30,33,2Nd4,b'5r1k/2pb2p1/1p1pp1Bp/p7/3N1r2/1QP4P/PP4P1/R6K b - -',This move however runs alongside what I had in mind when mentioning about 28.Nc4 as the N appears better placed.
1000,30,34,2Rf8f6,b'7k/2pb2p1/1p1pprBp/p7/3N1r2/1QP4P/PP4P1/R6K w - -',Aside from just attacking something I had no idea why Joe played this.  But I realize that what he's really doing is achieving a semi open which is very useful.  I know this because TA has won a different a Q sac game that I annotated with an open file.
1001,30,35,e5,b'7k/2pb2p1/1p1p1r1p/p3p3/3N1r2/1QP4P/PPB3P1/R6K w - -',Going after white's N with the reason being to achieve another set of pawn chains.  It is worth noting that tactical-abyss also taught me about the importance of a pawn chain.  And although I have been corrected for getting them wrong I now see the importance of that and where you really need them.
1002,30,36,Bc6,b'7k/2p3p1/1pbp1r1p/p3p3/5r2/1QP2N1P/PPB3P1/R6K w - -',The idea is to win a pawn and mess up white's structures around the K because Joe has 32...Bxf3 33.gxf3 Rxf3 in mind.

Just bringing his R to f1 won't cut the mustard as his opponent has two R's on that file which is a perfect example of where doubling up becomes dangerous.  And that is also why I was able to conclude that Joe had the advantage when 21...Raf8 was played.  In fact as we're about to see towards the end of the annotation black was already starting to get the initiative one the fourteenth (when tactical-abyss forked white's R+Q).

This move now offers exchange options for Black to blow open some holes in White's position and still keep a lot of pawns downrange for later advancement and positional restriction against White.

It is very important to get your king to safety early with a castle and link your rooks.  Some lost opportunities for development and faster castling would have significantly changed the Black assault on the king.  Allowing Black to build a second assault on the king proved White's ultimate downfall.  Thanks for reviewing and your comments.

1129,35,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Joe's preference is to open with 1.d4  In his thread playing style or styles of play he said that.  He said that many players like 1.e4 and for someone at my level that was probably the best but at his level he likes the QPO lines because different variations which he is more accustomed to.
1130,35,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Not surprised to see this.  But against his strength I would've played 2.Nf6  And that's because of what was mentioned in an ongoing consultation game.  The thing is that Joe isn't going to play the QG.  So I think that with his next move black might in the long run find himself in a little bit of true.  Generally speaking that isn't true and I know better then to conclude but I'm only basing it on what dynamic_dv mentioned in a consultation thread since 1...Nf6 is actually the most common response in the world database whereas 1...d5 is the second most common.  So when I and someonelse voted 1...d5 early on he said be careful because it's hard to win but easy to lose.  And if you make a mistake against someone of that strength you could go wrong very easily.
1131,35,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As anticipated.
1132,35,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I am not surprised to see Jim play this as afterall we're still in book.  That's not an opinion but rather a fact.  Although I don't play too many d4 openings I know some of the fundamentals there.
1133,35,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',This time gambiting the pawn since white will give up the pawn.  But I like his strategy as the plan is to play something like the Colle System.  By that I am implying 4.e3  It is often known from what I learned from both GM Susan Polgar and the same consultation thread that I mentioned also with Dave that the Colle System has been known to give you a slight edge in the opening especially do to the pawn chain so early on.
1134,35,5,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p4n2/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? I am not sure why he played but I think this is a mistake.  First not wanting to deviate due to who Jim is up against it doesn't develop.  But that's not as important since I have seen plenty of examples where strong players deviate.  The thing however is that white gets back a pawn.  With that being said I either would've played 4...Nc6 or 4...b5  Given that it was a QPG and the c pawn hasn't been exchanged I think that I would've fiachettoed right away with 4...b5 
1135,35,6,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/2p1pppp/p4n2/1p6/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',I am surprised to see black play this now since white took back.  However it does gain some time with the idea being that after white retreats black has a nice long diagonal.
1136,35,7,a4,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1pppp/p4n2/1p6/P2P4/3BPN2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq a3',This does show that strong players like these two can deviate.  I like this tactic as white is trying to win the pawn because if Joe is able to play 8.axb5 and black 8...axb5 after 9.Rxa8 Bxa8 white has an open file which as I saw with one of my recent annotations involving a Q sac that would give him an edge.  In fact in that game despite the sac he won by opening up the a file as I explained here.
1137,35,8,b4,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1pppp/p4n2/8/Pp1P4/3BPN2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',But black does not allow it.

The other thing to think about is the fact that white will find a better outpost for this so what he played is very good in my opinion.
1139,35,10,Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/1bpnpppp/p4n2/8/Pp1P4/3BPN2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',"It appears that black has the same idea in mind.  But the only problem is that there is no good outpost for the N as otherwise he would play ...Nb3 at some point.  That leaves Jim's N on c7 crammed and with it I already favor white's position.  In other words I believe that white already has a small advantage.

1161,35,32,2Qd7,b'r5k1/2pqprbp/3nRnp1/p5B1/Pp1P4/1N1B4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',This is more evidence that black wants to double up.
1162,35,33,2Nc5,b'r5k1/2pqprbp/3nRnp1/p1N3B1/Pp1P4/3B4/1PQ2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',That can especially be said here since this move delays that.  Therefore it's interesting to see what black will play next as there are options.

1164,35,35,2h4,b'r3q1k1/2p1prbp/3nRnp1/p1N3B1/Pp1P3P/3B4/1PQ2PP1/4R1K1 b - h3',Adding protection to his DSB.

Usually when it comes maneuvoing the monarch lest I lose my opportunity to do so and want the K safe with the R's I don't do it.  But as noted earlier this is where more theory gets involved.

I have studied some similar positions with GM positions and this is when they will attack the opponents Q with their P.  The idea being is to stop a plan like this since their opponent will have to get out of harm's way and when they do they get out of a situation like this.  As much as I hate to say this though it is too little too late.

I am pretty sure that this was a blunder that will seal his fate because by taking black gets more then he bargained for.  Instead of an open file white's next move will be disastrous for Jim.  However unlike usual I am not sure what black's best move would've been here.
1175,35,46,2Re5,b'r6k/1qp1prbp/3nN3/p2nR1Bp/P2P4/1p1B4/1P3PP1/2RQ2K1 b - -',With that being said Jim resigned.  Now I was wondering why he did and about a week or two ago viewed resignation as premature.  The reason being is that it appears that with this move white will lose his R for a B.  Normally I keep guessing but I know Joe's style too well to believe that due to studying his Q sacs and Double R sac and applying that knowledge in a couple of games including one against my coach to win in a resignable position.  So like what I have done before I really studied this Homework as I did with two other games.  I will tell you that this was one of the most difficult assignment I did.  Despite it only being a few moves this was as difficult as the one where ...Re1 was the solution with the idea of a draw when black promotes as you might have seen when doing the most difficult assignment by annotating Susan Polgar's win against Karpov and trying to figure out each move which helped.  In addition I will often do HW with TA's games.  So with further studying I realize that resignation was not premature.  And even I who does not resign and believes that one shouldn't would've done so here as no matter what white will mate in four or five moves.  So there are two scenarios that I played.  The first one is if Jim takes with 28...Bxe5  After that we have something like 29.dxe5 Nc8 30.Qxh8 Kg8 31.Bxh7+ Kh8 and after 32.Qxf7 white will mate with either 33.Qf8# or 33.Qg7#  The second scenario is if black finds the best move after which it's still mate.  So 28...h6 29.Qxh5 Kg8 30.Nxg7 Rxg7 31.Bxh6 Rf7 32.Bf8 e6 and after 33.Rxe6 white will mate the same way so either on f8 or g7 with his Q.

1262,38,15,3Rf4,b'7r/8/4k3/1P1p1pnr/p1n2R2/b3P1pP/R3N1K1/7Q b - -',White could trade a rook for knight and bishop.

1267,38,20,4Kf1,b'8/8/4k3/1P1pnp2/p3nR2/b5r1/4R3/5K2 b - -',Rf3+ trades rooks.  Fair trades now favor black up six points.

1272,38,25,5b6,b'8/8/1P2k3/3pnp2/p3nb2/8/2K1R2R/5r2 b - -',?  White should probably have played Rh7 instead.
1273,38,26,5Rxh2,b'8/8/1P2k3/3pnp2/p3n3/8/2K4R/5r2 b - -',Rf2+ trades rooks and black still prevents pawn promotion with Nd7 or Kd6.

Not that these are losing ones but do not help in the development. See that now black can go castling and start exerting some pressure on ""e"" column while WK is still far away from finding a safe place."
1281,39,4,Ng4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/2b5/4PPn1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Maybe not the best yet. Castling seemed to me to be a very strong one as mentioned before.

If played well that extra pawn should not bring any trouble. And yet I can activate my rook and start a mild attack if allowed. Let's see how this develops.

But this starts getting similar to those Greco positions from the XVII century (well not that similar since e6 is really blocking my bishop's attack. Let's give it a try then.
