0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my most typical opening.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Quite a usual move for black.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the best moves in this postion that I know of.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I protected my pawn.
4,0,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Threatening to take my pawn on f7 by moving his knight to g5...
5,0,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',...So I moved my bishop to c5. 
6,0,6,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Another move.
7,0,7,b4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/2b1p3/1PB1P3/2PP1N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',Uh oh I think he's got my pawn.
8,0,8,Nxc4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/1b3n1p/1P6/2N1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I was a pwn down- at the beginning game.
9,0,9,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/1Pb5/2N1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Not going for the swap off. 
10,0,10,Bxa3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/1P6/2N1P3/b1PP4/P4PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Ok- I took the swap off now.
11,0,11,4Rxb7,b'8/1R4pk/7p/3r4/5P2/6PP/6K1/8 b - -',This is when I offered him a draw and he accepted as it was a drawish postion even though he was a pawn up.
12,1,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Nf3 for white doesn't seem like white's best play in this situation.  It allows black to play 3...d5 which will force the bishop to eventually move.
13,1,1,Bb3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/8/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Didn't expect to see this at all.  I was expecting either Bb5+ or a retreat to Be2. 
14,1,2,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/8/1ppp4/8/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',This is poor move from me.  Thankfully my opponent didn't play 6. Qe2+ because I would've dropped that pawn I advanced. 
15,1,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/5n2/1p1p4/2p5/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Maybe a stronger move here would've been Bg4 pinning the knight?
16,1,4,Qc7,b'r3kb1r/p1q2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/B1p3b1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Although my queen is protecting my pinned knight now she's also eying down the h2 square and hopefully I'm able to get my bishop to d6 so I can possibly snatch the pawn on h2 after Bxf3.
17,1,5,e3,b'7k/p5rp/5Q2/3p4/2p4P/2P1p1PK/q7/8 w - -',Had my opponent seen this he could have had a draw here.  I shouldn't have captured on a2.....Maybe Kg8 or h5 to give my king an outlet to avoid the draw.
18,1,6,Rg8,b'3Q2rk/p6p/8/8/2p3qP/2P1p3/7K/8 w - -',White Resigned 0-1
19,2,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As usual black fights back with a Sicilian.
20,2,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',The trouble with this variation is it leaves white with a rather weak center.
21,2,2,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq f3',An unusual attack here and not a terribly useful one. It leaves the e4 pawn unsupported.
22,2,3,1f5,b'r1b1k2r/p1q2ppp/2pp1n2/4pP2/1b2P3/2N2Q2/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This pawn is a bit of a sticking point but it never turns into more than an annoyance.
23,2,4,dxc5,b'r1b2rk1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/2p1pP2/4P3/P2B1Q2/1PPB2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black is now set with the task of exchanging one of his doubled pawns for a non-doubled white pawn.
24,2,5,1b3,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1qp2n2/2p1pP2/4P3/PP1B1Q2/2PB2PP/R4RK1 b - -',This is the threat that needs to be defended. If 16. ... c4+ 17. Be3 Qmoves 18. bxc4.
25,2,6,1Ba6,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/bqp2n2/2p1pP2/4P3/PP1B1Q2/2PB2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Forcing a trade of a relatively bad bishop for a good one.
26,2,7,1Qc3,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/q1p2n2/2p1pP2/4P3/PPQ5/2PB2PP/R4RK1 b - -',? e4 is the key to this position and needs to be defended.
27,2,8,1Nxe4,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/q1p5/2p1pP2/4n3/PPQ5/2PB2PP/R4RK1 w - -',! If 19. Qxe5 Nxd2 and worse to follow. This capture has also given black the passed pawn that will eventually win the game.
28,2,9,f6,b'r4rk1/p5pp/q1p2p2/2p1pP2/8/PP6/2PQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Risky as it exposes the black king to attack along the a2-g8 diagonal but the e5 pawn needs support.
29,2,10,Qb6,b'r4rk1/p5pp/1qpQ1p2/2p1pP2/8/PP6/2P3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Those doubled pawns still need protection. The threatened Qe6+ is of no significant consequence whereas the black's threat of c4+ allows black to trade off one of his doubled pawns.
30,2,11,Rd8,b'3r3k/p5pp/1qp1Qp2/2p1pP2/8/PP6/2P3PP/3R3K w - -',Black's queen makes this move possible and forces white off of the d file. Black is now trying to take advantage of white's back rank while protecting his own.
31,2,12,Qxa3,b'3r3k/p5pp/2p1Qp2/2p1pP2/8/qP6/2P3PP/5R1K w - -',And black has managed to trade off a doubled pawn.
32,2,13,2Qc7,b'3r3k/p1Q3pp/5p2/2p1pP2/1q6/1P6/2P3PP/5R1K b - -',! Definitely the right attacking move here.
33,2,14,2Qb6,b'3r3k/p1Q3pp/1q3p2/2p1pP2/8/1P6/2P3PP/5R1K w - -',! Defends d8 a7 and c5 all at once. White has to run or trade.
34,2,15,h5,b'3r3k/4Q1p1/1q3p2/p1p1pP1p/8/1P5P/2P3P1/5R1K w - h6',Correcting black's back rank weakness but more aggressively than white's. This becomes important shortly.
35,2,16,h4,b'3r3k/4Q1p1/1q3p2/p1p1pP2/7p/1P3R1P/2P3P1/7K w - -',To prevent an immediate Rg3 followed by attacks on g7.
36,2,17,Qd6,b'7k/5Qp1/3q1p2/p1p1pP2/7p/1P3R1P/2P3PK/3r4 w - -',Offering draw by perpetual check if white chooses to take it.
37,2,18,3Qxh4,b'6k1/6p1/3q1p2/p1p1pP2/7Q/1P3R1P/2P3PK/3r4 b - -',? White is better off with the draw.
38,2,19,3e4+,b'6k1/6p1/3q1p2/p1p2P2/4p2Q/1P3R1P/2P3PK/3r4 w - -',! This is the most difficult step this pawn has to take towards victory.
39,2,20,3Rg3,b'6k1/6p1/3q1p2/p1p2P2/4p2Q/1P4RP/2P3PK/3r4 b - -',The two alternatives Rf4 and Qf4 leave white hard-pressed to stop the e-pawn. For instance 37. Qf4 Qxf4 38. Rxf4 Rd4 39. Rf1 e3 40. Re1 Re4 and white is nearly out of options.
40,2,21,3Qe5,b'6k1/6p1/5p2/p1p1qP2/4p2Q/1P4RP/2P3PK/3r4 w - -',Otherwise e3 is met by Qe4.
41,2,22,Kf8,b'5k2/3r2p1/5p2/p1p1qP2/2Q5/1P2p1RP/2P3P1/6K1 w - -',Not Kh8 which would allow perpetual check. Not Rf7 which gives up too much mobility.
42,2,23,e2,b'5k2/3r2p1/5p2/p1p1qP2/2Q5/1P3R1P/2P1p1P1/6K1 w - -',"White has no way to stop the pawn from doing serious damage:
(A) 42. Kf2? e1=Q#
(B) 42. Rf1 exf1 0-1
(C) 42. Qxe2 Qxe2 0-1
(E) 42. Qb5 Rd1+ (E1) 43. Kf2 e1=Q# (E2) 43. Rf1 Rxf1#
(F) 42. Qf4 e1=Q+ 43. Kh2 Qxf4 44. Rxf4 e1=Q+ 45. Kh2 Qe5 0-1"
43,3,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Another close fought match with a few mistakes on either side which as a result could easily have gone either way
44,3,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',It's a long time since I have seen this opening from white so I decided to go for the centre. This is the Nimzovich-Larsen attack modern variation.
45,3,2,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B6/4p3/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Played to avoid going a pawn down from Bxc6 b7xc6 Bxe5 which I didn't like the look of
46,3,3,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/1B6/4p3/1PN1P3/PBPP1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',There is only one game in the gameknot database that gets to this position
47,3,4,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/8/4p3/1PN1P3/PBPP1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',I didn't like the possibly more natural bxc6 as it totally wrecked my pawn structure this didn't look quite so bad as an alternative
48,3,5,Bf5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p2n2/5b2/4p3/1PN1PP2/PBPP2PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',This is the move that varies from the other game there Bd7 was played.
49,3,6,1Nf3,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/4b3/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Pretty much forced as Bxg2 would be unpleasant for white
50,3,7,1Qd5,b'r3kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1p5/3q4/4b3/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I'm still not entirely sure why I played this but it does make a claim on the centre and give me the option to castle
51,3,8,f6,b'2kr1b1r/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/3q4/8/1P1PPQ2/PBP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',I won't object too much if white exchanges as I can improve my pawn structure. This move was to protect the g7 pawn from whites bishop and it was also to prepare for a future pawn storm
52,3,9,h5,b'1k1r3r/1pp3p1/p1p2p2/2b4p/4P3/1P1P4/PBP3PP/R4R1K w - h6',Here comes the pawns can I make something of it
53,3,10,fxe5,b'1k1r3r/1pp3p1/p1p5/2b1p3/7p/1P1P4/PBP3PP/4RR1K w - -',I didn't like the look of the alternatives here
54,3,11,Rhg8,b'1k1r2r1/1pp3p1/p1p5/2b1B3/7p/1P1P4/P1P3PP/4RR1K w - -',protecting the pawn and preparing an advance but white had other ideas
55,3,12,2Rf7,b'1k1r2r1/1pp2Rp1/p1p5/2b1B3/7p/1P1P4/P1P3PP/4R2K b - -',I had overlooked this
56,3,13,2Bd6,b'1k1r2r1/1pp2Rp1/p1pb4/4B3/7p/1P1P4/P1P3PP/4R2K w - -',about the only way to get out of it without losing material that I could see.
57,3,14,Rxd6,b'1k4r1/1pp2Rp1/p1pr4/8/7p/1P1P4/P1P3PP/4R2K w - -',I preferred this to cxd6 due to Re-e7 which looked pretty nasty
58,3,15,2h3,b'1k4r1/1pp2Rp1/p1pr4/8/7p/1P1P3P/P1P3P1/4R2K b - -',This seems a wasted move to me and was quite a surpise
59,3,16,2Ree7,b'1k4r1/1pp1RR2/p1pr4/6p1/7p/1P1P3P/P1P3P1/7K b - -',and here it is however as I still have a pawn on c7 I can resist the pressure
60,3,17,Rf6,b'1kr5/1pp1R1R1/p1p2r2/6p1/7p/1P1P3P/P1P3P1/7K w - -',If white is going to start pawn grabbing I need to try to do the same
61,3,18,2Rxg5,b'1kr5/1pp1R3/p1p2r2/6R1/7p/1P1P3P/P1P3P1/7K b - -',To me Kg1 looks better as it prevents my next move
62,3,19,2Rf2,b'1kr5/1pp1R3/p1p5/6R1/7p/1P1P3P/P1P2rP1/7K w - -',regains a pawn
63,3,20,Rxa2,b'1kr5/1pp5/p1p5/6R1/7R/1P1P3P/r5P1/7K w - -',From here white looks better to me particularly with his connected passed pawns
64,3,21,2Rb4,b'1kr5/1pp5/p1p5/6R1/1R6/1P1P3P/r5P1/7K b - -',I dont understand this move 
65,3,22,Rb2,b'1kr5/1pp5/2p5/p5R1/R7/1P1P3P/1r4P1/7K w - -',I preferred this to exchanging rooks as I was hoping to get a passer of my own
66,3,23,3Rgxa5,b'1kr5/1pp5/2p5/R7/R7/1P1P3P/1r4P1/7K b - -',and once again completely overlooked this move. Clearly white is threatening mate
67,3,24,3b5,b'1kr5/2p5/2p5/Rp6/R7/1P1P3P/1r4P1/7K w - b6',The only defence I could see from mate.
68,3,25,Kxa7,b'2R5/k1p5/2p5/1p6/8/1P1P3P/1r4P1/7K w - -',Now whites rook is a little stuck and although he can gain more material I think he has lost the initiative and I can get a passed pawn of my own
69,3,26,Rxb3,b'8/3R4/1kp5/1p6/8/1r1P3P/6P1/7K w - -',Now there is surely going to be a race for promotion I would hope that I have the advantage as my b pawn is one move ahead of whites pawns
70,3,27,Rb1+,b'8/3R4/1kp5/7P/1p6/3P4/6P1/1r5K w - -',White has to be a little careful now as I have spotted a ploy that I am hoping will get me a queen and prevent him promoting but he is short of time and his rook is in no real position to gain more time e.g. with a check
71,3,28,4Rd8,b'3R4/8/1kp4P/8/8/3P4/1p4PK/1r6 b - -',Threatens to skewer my pawn with Rb8
72,3,29,4Rh1+,b'3R4/8/1kp4P/8/8/3P4/1p4PK/7r w - -',And now my plan comes to fruition I really liked this move probably one of the best I have played for some time.
73,3,30,4Kxh1,b'3R4/8/1kp4P/8/8/3P4/1p4P1/7K b - -',Means that when I promote I can prevent the skewer as white will be in check
74,3,31,Qc1,b'3R4/8/1kp4P/8/8/3P4/6PK/2q5 w - -',If h7 then clearly Qh6+ gains the pawn
75,3,32,4Rh8,b'7R/8/1kp4P/8/8/3P4/6PK/2q5 b - -',I need to be careful that I dont allow white to push his g pawn or his king (or both) up the board too far
76,3,33,4Rg7,b'8/6R1/1kp4P/8/8/3q2PK/8/8 b - -',I'm looking to fork the pawn or rook with the king but white is too canny for that
77,3,34,4Qd6,b'8/6R1/1kpq3P/8/8/6PK/8/8 w - -',if h7 then Qh6+
78,3,35,4Rg4,b'8/8/1kpq3P/8/6R1/6PK/8/8 b - -',This was a shock white concedes the pawn and likely the game
79,3,36,c5,b'8/8/1k5q/2p5/6R1/6P1/6K1/8 w - -',"Here white resigned. This was a hard fought match with mistakes on both sides in the end there was an element of luck that prevailed. I think white still had chances right up to move 49 when he seemed to throw it away.

Please comment"
80,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',In this game I play a speculative sacrifice. My opponent goes wrong and loses easily. I was dissappointed that the post-game computer analysis says my sac was not the best move in the position? What do you think dear reader?  Can anyone see what an independent search engine says is best in the position?
81,4,1,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So was start as a standard Dutch defence
82,4,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Routine development.

85,4,5,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppp1bp/2n2np1/5p2/3P1N2/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Still fairly standard
86,4,6,h4,b'r1bqk2r/ppppp1bp/2n2np1/5p2/3P1N1P/6P1/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK2R b KQkq h3',PLayed to ancor the Nf4 and deter g5 and also with the possibility of attacking with h5 at some stage.
87,4,7,e5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2bp/2n2np1/4pp2/3P1N1P/6P1/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK2R w KQkq e6',The usual reply.
88,4,8,dxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2bp/2n2np1/4Pp2/5N1P/6P1/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Taking is about White's only sensible option.
89,4,9,c3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2bp/5np1/4np2/5N1P/2P3P1/PP2PPB1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',c3 scores well on the opening databases

Bxe5 dxe5 13. Nh3 e4 14. Nc4 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 O-O 16. h5 Be6 17. Nd6 Rab8 18. hxg6 hxg6 and a slight advantage to Black.

After researching this position I found that on chess.com all the given games of this time give the win to black.

This line is preferable for black over Qg3 Qxg3?? gxf3 Bxf1 Rxf1 and the pinned knight is lost again with the same motif that lost its partner earlier black is even more lost.  After Qg3 the first line is best and because the black queen is the sole defender of the f4 knight which holds together black's KS operations black cannot retreat the queen anywhere but g5 where it is weaker and after Rg1 or Rc1 black is the one in trouble.

..... in this game I managed to stay alert and patient and I tried something on the kingside late on in the endgame and it worked!  Yup I have conceded a couple of low draws lately in my rated games because there seemed to be no way whatsoever of forcing a victory (and one of those low draws was against Delta the Master Blaster who I knew not to mess with!).  Class B and C players are certainly capable of nasty things against me so I know when to hold out the olive branch.  However in this case I got lucky.  Here is how it goes (it starts off with a Scandinavian/Centre Counter Defense with 1. e4 d5) and here is the gameknot analysis.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16301005&rnd=0.1441176371074478"

499,18,15,Qc7,b'2r3k1/1pq2ppp/p7/5PP1/2rPRQ2/8/P6P/5R1K w - -',Now my plan bears fruit.  With my heavy pieces in position on the c-file I have sufficient counter-play to neutralize his attack on the e-file.  My task is made easier by the weakness of white's kingside on the diagonals - a weakened king position is the price white paid for his early aggression.

It is known as the Morphy defense and the idea is pretty simple. Since white can't capture the e4 pawn immediately blaack will try to kick off the bishop and play b5 if needed.

Although the pin isn't too effective it would discourage d4 because white would have doubled pawns on the f file if he wanted to keep a pawn. It also would damage whites pawn structure.

3. King Safety: Black is clearly better here because black is ready to castle while white still is two or three moves from castling to safety. Advantage for Black
4. Tactical threats and open lines: White has strong pressure on d5 but at present has no real way to exploit it. While black has more tangible pressure on e5 because Black can use of the f-file to gain tempo against the undefended bishop.

To compensate for this weakness black has direct threats against the rook on a8 15. ...Be6 attacking the queen if 15. Qb3+ and finally the c6 knight is checking both of White's weak pawns.

1034,37,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black responds symmetrically and we have a King's pawn game.
1035,37,1,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White attacks immediately in the opening with 2. Qh5 putting pressure on e5 and the weak spot at f7. Black loses material quickly if he plays 2... g6?? 3. Qxe5+ and 4. Qxh8.
1036,37,2,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',A mistake from Black as he misses the threat of Qxe5 and develops his bishop to c5.
1037,37,3,Qxe5+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White takes the pawn at e5 providing a check and threatening the bishop just developed.
1038,37,4,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppnppp/8/2b1Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Black makes another error - possibly worried about 4. Qxg7 Black develops the Knight but leaves the Bishop all alone.
1039,37,5,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppnppp/1p6/2Q5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Black attacks the White Queen and provides an avenue for his Bishop to develop into. I'd have preferred 4. d6 to prevent Qe5 but I don't mind this.
1040,37,6,Qe5,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppnppp/1p6/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White chooses to attack the weak pawn at g7 again.
1041,37,7,f6,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',And Black responds with another pawn move weakening a possible king-side castle but attacking the Queen.
1042,37,8,Qg3,b'rnbqk2r/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Five of the first six moves from White have been made by the Queen but it has done some damage as it returns with a pawn and bishop. More pressure on g7.
1043,37,9,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ -',Black chooses to castle here - given this choose of move I think Black might have been better castling last move.
1044,37,10,d4,b'rnbq1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/8/3PP3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQ d3',As it stands at this position White has a very strong advantage - both materially and spatially.
1045,37,11,Bh6,b'rnbqr1k1/p1ppn1pp/1p3p1B/8/3PP3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQ -',White is relentless in attacking the Black King by making use of the pin of the g7 pawn and threatening checkmate.
1046,37,12,g5,b'rnbqr1k1/p1ppn2p/1p3p1B/6p1/3PP3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQ g6',Black tries to trap the White Bishop with a pawn push but further weakens his castle. 8. Ng6 would have prevented the mating threat and forced the bishop to move away... However Black would have won his piece back with Nf5 using the Rook on e8 to pin the pawn to e4.
1047,37,13,h4,b'rnbqr1k1/p1ppn2p/1p3p1B/6p1/3PP2P/6Q1/PPP2PP1/RN2KBNR b KQ h3',White attacks the weak pawn structure in front of the Black King which will also release his rook.
1048,37,14,Nbc6,b'r1bqr1k1/p1ppn2p/1pn2p1B/6p1/3PP2P/6Q1/PPP2PP1/RN2KBNR w KQ -',Black finally develops a queen-side piece but I wonder if Ng6 might have been more suitable in this situation... as well as providing some support to the king it gives Black some counterplay with the threat on e4.
1049,37,15,1hxg5,b'r1bqr1k1/p1ppn2p/1pn2p1B/6P1/3PP3/6Q1/PPP2PP1/RN2KBNR b KQ -',Black's defense is starting to crumble from under him.

1052,37,18,1d5,b'r1bqr1k1/p1p1n2p/1p3p1B/3p2P1/2BnP3/6Q1/PPP2PP1/RN2K1NR w KQ d6',This is the best move for Black giving up a pawn but opening up the Bishop's c8-f1 diagonal. 11... Kh8 12. gxf6 would lose for Black. 12... Ng6 13. Bg7# or 12... Rg8 13. Qg7+ Rxg7 14. Bxg7# or 12... Nf5 (either knight) 13. Qg7+ Nxg7 14. Bxg7#.

1057,37,23,1Bxa8,b'B2qr1k1/p1p4p/1p2bPnB/8/3nP3/6Q1/PPP2PP1/RN2K1NR b KQ -',White chooses to grab another piece putting him +11 up in material terms at this moment. White's King is in the middle of the board with little support and I think White underestimates how quickly Black can now mobilise for an attack on that King. Black has a forced mate in four here.
1058,37,24,1Nxc2+,b'B2qr1k1/p1p4p/1p2bPnB/8/4P3/6Q1/PPn2PP1/RN2K1NR w KQ -',I like this move a lot - many players will re-take a piece just because they assume they must. Black ignores the Bishop to mount an attack of his own.

1061,37,27,Qxf6+,b'B3r1k1/p1p4p/1p3qnB/8/2b1P3/5KQ1/PPn2PP1/RN4NR w - -',Black misses a forced mate in two here with 16... Qd1+ 17. Ne2 Qxe2# but continues his attack with Qf6+ trying to close his pieces in around the White King.
1062,37,28,1Bf4,b'B3r1k1/p1p4p/1p3qn1/8/2b1PB2/5KQ1/PPn2PP1/RN4NR b - -',White blocks the check from the Queen with his bishop.
