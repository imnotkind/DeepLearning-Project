0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',His opening move came as no surprise
1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And my reply can't have been either.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He varies from the d4 he played in the previous game.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So one knight move deserves another
4,0,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',All main line so far
5,0,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I take
6,0,6,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This was hardly a surprise either he played the Smith-Morra gambit last time.
7,0,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I did my usual reply. Black can accept the pawn but this is good as well a suggestion of Leonard Barden.
8,0,8,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/4P3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the most commonly played move in the position.
9,0,9,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And this is the only decent move for black.
10,0,10,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/2Bp4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',He played this move last time in a slightly different position.
11,0,11,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/2Bp4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',And I hit the bishop again. In the previous game he now played Bxf7ch but later found that he didn't have enough for the bishop and he lost relatively quickly.
12,0,12,Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3p4/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But this time he played a sensible move.
13,0,13,dxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/8/1Bp2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move is inconsistent and I later found out that it scores badly on the opening databases.
14,0,14,Nxc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',And this is about the only decent move for white. I thought here - well I am a pawn up let's go for exchanges.
15,0,15,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Looking for exchanges on e5 if he doesn't take.
16,0,16,exd6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnP4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',But he takes first.
17,0,17,Qxd6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/1nnq4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Afterwards I found that exd6 is more commonly played but I hoped this would lead to an exchange of queens and the chance to nurse my extra pawn to victory.
18,0,18,1Qxd6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/1nnQ4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',And he did take after a long think
19,0,19,1exd6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nnp4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',So I took back.
20,0,20,1Nb5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nnp4/1N6/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Ouch! How am going to defend against Nc7 forking king and rook? I was also afraid of his bishop coming to f4 building up on my d6 pawn. Also my king can hardly go to d7 or the f7 pawn drops. I did afterwards find on the database a gameknot game from this position and black finally won after Rb8 12. Ng5 Ne5 13. f4 Nec4 whitefooted (2094) vs. yokenster (2078). However I think white can improve on this with 12. Bf4 and black looks to be in trouble. What do you think dear reader?
21,0,21,1Be6,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1nnpb3/1N6/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',So I came to the conclusion the best bet was to sacrifice the exchange
22,0,22,1Nc7+,b'r3kb1r/ppN2ppp/1nnpb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',So he checked
23,0,23,1Kd7,b'r4b1r/ppNk1ppp/1nnpb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',and I moved the king
24,0,24,1Nxa8,b'N4b1r/pp1k1ppp/1nnpb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',He took the rook
25,0,25,1Nxa8,b'n4b1r/pp1k1ppp/2npb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I took back
26,0,26,1O-O,b'n4b1r/pp1k1ppp/2npb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',He castled
27,0,27,1Be7,b'n6r/pp1kbppp/2npb3/8/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I developed my bishop
28,0,28,1Ng5,b'n6r/pp1kbppp/2npb3/6N1/8/1B6/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This move does not look right to me. I think simple development say Bf4 and moving the rooks onto the central files looks better to me.
29,0,29,1Bxb3,b'n6r/pp1kbppp/2np4/6N1/8/1b6/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So I stop his planned NxBe6 and double his pawns. The downside is that I open up the a file for his rook.
30,0,30,1axb3,b'n6r/pp1kbppp/2np4/6N1/8/1P6/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',"He takes back. I was dying to play Nd4 here threatening to play Ne7ch followed by NxBc8 and BxNg5. However White gets in first with Rxa7 followed by Rxb7ch for instance Nd4 17. Rxa7 Ne2+ 18. Kh1 Nxc1 19. Rxb7+ Nc7 20. Rxc1 Bxg5 21. Rcxc7+  winning easily.
"
31,0,31,1h6,b'n6r/pp1kbpp1/2np3p/6N1/8/1P6/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"So I hit his knight. There is an interesting continuation here. 17. Nxf7 Rf8 and his knight is trapped but he has 18. Nxh6 gxh6 19. Bxh6 and he had gained 3 pawns for the knight.
"
32,0,32,1Ne4,b'n6r/pp1kbpp1/2np3p/8/4N3/1P6/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',The knight is soon hit again on this square so I think 17. Nf3 may have been better although then I have Bf6 hitting his b7 pawn making it hard for him to complete his development but then maybe he can gambit it with 18. Bf4 and if Bxb7 he has Ra-d1 attacking my d pawn.
33,0,33,1d5,b'n6r/pp1kbpp1/2n4p/3p4/4N3/1P6/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I hit the knight
34,0,34,1Rd1,b'n6r/pp1kbpp1/2n4p/3p4/4N3/1P6/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',He pins the pawn.
35,0,35,1Ke6,b'n6r/pp2bpp1/2n1k2p/3p4/4N3/1P6/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',I break the pin. King up for the ending!
36,0,36,1Nc3,b'n6r/pp2bpp1/2n1k2p/3p4/8/1PN5/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',The knight eventually retreats.
37,0,37,1Rd8,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n1k2p/3p4/8/1PN5/1P3PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',I have to protect d5 again and this is best. If I protect it with my Na8 he can attack the knight with his bishop. I was beginning to feel a little happier with my position. If you compare it with the position after my 13th move I have managed to bishop and rook onto better squares and double his b pawns. His rooks are more active but he has wasted time with his knight.
38,0,38,2Re1+,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n1k2p/3p4/8/1PN5/1P3PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',He checks
39,0,39,2Kf6,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n2k1p/3p4/8/1PN5/1P3PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',The king moves
40,0,40,2Bf4,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n2k1p/3p4/5B2/1PN5/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',He develops his bishop.
41,0,41,2d4,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n2k1p/8/3p1B2/1PN5/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I hit his knight again!
42,0,42,2Ne4+,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n2k1p/8/3pNB2/1P6/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',He checks
43,0,43,2Kf5,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n4p/5k2/3pNB2/1P6/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',King up. Now if he plays Bg3 then Bb4 looks good to me. To maintain the protection of his Ne4 23. Re2 is forced then d3 forces Re3 and then Nd4 looks massive to me. Nc7 is threatened and if Rxd6? loses to Ne7+. Unfortunately he probably saw all this too.....
44,0,44,2Bd2,b'n2r4/pp2bpp1/2n4p/5k2/3pN3/1P6/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',So he retreated his bishop to a better square.
45,0,45,2Nc7,b'3r4/ppn1bpp1/2n4p/5k2/3pN3/1P6/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So finally this knight comes into play.
46,0,46,2b4,b'3r4/ppn1bpp1/2n4p/5k2/1P1pN3/8/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',He threatens b5 and if I take on b4 he wins the pawn on a7. I prevent b5 but maybe the best way of me to do this is to play b5 myself.
47,0,47,2a6,b'3r4/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/5k2/1P1pN3/8/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So I stop b5
48,0,48,2Nc5,b'3r4/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/2N2k2/1P1p4/8/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',But he has this Maybe taking this knight was best but instead I played 
49,0,49,2Rd5,b'8/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/2Nr1k2/1P1p4/8/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',and held my breath. Now if he takes on b7 I take on b4 his knight on b7 is short of squares I don't think I can actually win it. But luckily for me while I was considering whether it was best to take with the knight or the bishop on b4 he played what I think is a weaker alternative for him.
50,0,50,2Nd3,b'8/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/3r1k2/1P1p4/3N4/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',This protects b4 but....
51,0,51,2Rb5,b'8/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/1r3k2/1P1p4/3N4/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I can attack it again and I have Nd5 coming in attacking it again. He can't hold this pawn and I think chances are equal now. Somewhere around here I offered a draw which he turned down.
52,0,52,2h3,b'8/1pn1bpp1/p1n4p/1r3k2/1P1p4/3N3P/1P1B1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I'm not sure this helps him much.
53,0,53,2Nd5,b'8/1p2bpp1/p1n4p/1r1n1k2/1P1p4/3N3P/1P1B1PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Onwards with my plan
54,0,54,2g4+,b'8/1p2bpp1/p1n4p/1r1n1k2/1P1p2P1/3N3P/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 b - g3',Yet another check achieving about as much as the previous ones!
55,0,55,2Kf6,b'8/1p2bpp1/p1n2k1p/1r1n4/1P1p2P1/3N3P/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',In fact here I am protecting my bishop
56,0,56,2h4,b'8/1p2bpp1/p1n2k1p/1r1n4/1P1p2PP/3N4/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 b - -',Hecarries on with this advance.
57,0,57,2Bd6,b'8/1p3pp1/p1nb1k1p/1r1n4/1P1p2PP/3N4/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',No need to hurry to take the b pawn it is not going anywhere. This move may prevent him from putting a piece on e5 or f4 and also in some variation he may play g5+ to devert my king from protecting my bishop.
58,0,58,3h5,b'8/1p3pp1/p1nb1k1p/1r1n3P/1P1p2P1/3N4/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 b - -',He continues with his plan.
59,0,59,3Ncxb4,b'8/1p3pp1/p2b1k1p/1r1n3P/1n1p2P1/3N4/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I finally take the pawn.
60,0,60,3Nxb4,b'8/1p3pp1/p2b1k1p/1r1n3P/1N1p2P1/8/1P1B1P2/R3R1K1 b - -',He takes

62,0,62,3Bxb4,b'8/1p3pp1/p2b1k1p/1r5P/1B1p2P1/8/1P3P2/R3R1K1 b - -',So he takes.
63,0,63,3Rxb4,b'8/1p3pp1/p2b1k1p/7P/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/R3R1K1 w - -',I take back this way hitting b7 and protecting d4
64,0,64,3Ra5,b'8/1p3pp1/p2b1k1p/R6P/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 b - -',This is a lovely move! Maybe this is what he had been planning? Can you see what he is threatening?
65,0,65,3g6,b'8/1p3p2/p2b1kpp/R6P/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',He was hoping for Rf5 mate!
66,0,66,3hxg6,b'8/1p3p2/p2b1kPp/R7/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 b - -',So he takes
67,0,67,3fxg6,b'8/1p6/p2b1kpp/R7/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',I take back
68,0,68,3Rd5,b'8/1p6/p2b1kpp/3R4/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 b - -',He attacks
69,0,69,3Bb8,b'1b6/1p6/p4kpp/3R4/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',The plan with this move was Ba7 and if I can play Rxb2 I can gang up on his f2. 
70,0,70,3Rd8,b'1b1R4/1p6/p4kpp/8/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 b - -',He hits the bishop. He was really short of time now
71,0,71,3Ba7,b'3R4/bp6/p4kpp/8/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',I move the bishop
72,0,72,3Rf8+,b'5R2/bp6/p4kpp/8/1r1p2P1/8/1P3P2/4R1K1 b - -',He checks

79,0,79,4Kh5,b'5R2/bp6/p5pp/7k/3pR3/8/1r3PK1/8 w - -',King retreats
80,0,80,4Re5+,b'5R2/bp6/p5pp/4R2k/3p4/8/1r3PK1/8 b - -',He checks again
81,0,81,4g5,b'5R2/bp6/p6p/4R1pk/3p4/8/1r3PK1/8 w - -',I block the check. I am playing for the win now! I lost track of what happened next. He played a rook to the 6th rank threatening to double rooks on the sixth and win my h pawn. I prevented that by retreating my rook to b6 and he exchanged rooks on b6. Somehow I managed to blunder away my h g and d pawns but I pushed by b pawn to b2. My king was on f8 his pawn on f6 and he played Kg6?? thinking I couldn't queen as he was threatening mate. However I played b8=Q CHECK. Shortly afterwards I noticed he had lost on time but he was a queen down anyway at that stage. So many thanks reading this please leave a comment or two and please rate this on the star system. 
82,1,0,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the wise moves here. 
83,1,1,c6,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Necessary to block the white knight from b or d5 and to provide the queen hers best square c7.
84,1,2,Bd2,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',c7 is on the reach. No danger from the discovered threat to the queen. So I can go on developing. 
85,1,3,e6,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Assuming Nh4 exchanges my bishop. No problem. The h column will be opened for me. 
86,1,4,Bd6,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/q4b2/8/P1NP1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',If b4 Qc7 and if b5 I hold the exchange.  But white failed to occupy the good black diagonal.
87,1,5,Be2,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/q4b2/8/P1NP1N2/1PPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Preparing to castle but nothing more. White evaluated that the discovered attack leads to nothing. 
88,1,6,Nf6,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/8/P1NP1N2/1PPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Tempting him. Ne7 would have been more solid. 
89,1,7,Ne4,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/4N3/P2P1N2/1PPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',He acccepts the bite and must choose between scramble my pawns or get rid of my good dsb. 
90,1,8,1Nxd6+,b'rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2pNpn2/5b2/8/P2P1N2/1PPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',NxN scrambles my pawns but opens a column for my rook too.
91,1,9,c5,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/2p2b2/1B6/P2P1N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Now there is not a knight threat on the 5th row so no problem in breaking my fortress if I am winning tempo and occupying the center in the process.
92,1,10,1Bc3,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/2p2b2/8/P1BP1N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',He again can scramble my pawns but I decided to afford it.

96,1,14,Ne5,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/1q2pp2/2p1nb2/8/P2P4/1PPNBPPP/R1Q1K2R w KQ -',It was important to block Nc5 but I will fail. 
97,1,15,1h3,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/1q2pp2/2p1nb2/8/P2P3P/1PPNBPP1/R1Q1K2R b KQ -',Not f4 unless he planned to castle queenside.

I personally think that stronger is f4 as in the previously mentioned game. Black then usually exchanges on f4 (otherwise he may be crushed on the kingside if f4-f5 is allowed).

Master Chrisobee kindly invited me to attend his team's chessic New Year's Party tournament.  Yours truly somehow manages to join in the fun by making an absolute meal of a victory against my Class C opponent Ed.  Ed did play very well all the way through to ensure that I did make heavy weather of such a victory.  In fact I think he was very unfortunate to lose this game but his speculative piece sac in the middlegame to try and checkmate Henry did not pay off.  So how did I manage to do this?  Well here is the Gameknot Analysis as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17135473&fb=1&rnd=0.3426624133135317.  As you can see from the analysis there is plenty of yellow my side of the board!!  In response to my opponent's e4 I decided to play the French Defense.  Since being absolutely canned by my master buddy Lighttotheright in this opening in a training game I have not played this opening very much in a rated game particularly with 18 or 19 rating points at stake if I mess up here!  But I take my courage in both hands and thankfully I was eventually rewarded but not until the Wicked Witch of the West gave Henry a few scares!  So here we go ......"

Such play can sometimes lead to the Witch putting herself on g4 threatening Qxg7 to restrict my kingside play.  Thankfully she does not go there until Move 14 and that is after I have developed a few pieces and Henry has gone kingside.

However there is a little matter of the pawn on e6 threatening to orchestrate the appearance of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Firstly though I decided to save my c7 pawn.

485,18,6,Reg8,b'r5rk/1pp5/p3p2p/2Pp2qB/1P1Pb3/4P2P/P4RP1/R2Q2K1 w - -',Now the game is beginning to look more like the sort I enjoy playing - open with attacking lines and tactical nuances around every corner. Here I passed on taking the e-pawn in order to gain greater pressure against White's King. After 23. ...Qe3  24. Qd2 lets the steam out.
486,18,7,2Rf1,b'7k/1pp3r1/p3p2p/2Pp2q1/1P1P4/4PQ1P/P5P1/5RK1 b - -',White is winning but as long as the e-pawn hangs especially with a check the situation isn't entirely clear nor the game in the bag.
487,18,8,Qe7,b'8/1p2q1k1/p6p/P1PQ4/8/7P/6P1/6K1 w - -',Black is obviously playing not to lose at this point with the vulnerability of White's King giving him reason to hope for a draw.
488,18,9,Qe8,b'4q1k1/1p6/p6p/P1P2Q2/6PK/7P/8/8 w - -',A decisive mistake! 61. ...Qg7 may have been marginally better. Certainly the Black Queen must stay on squares that either check or guard the pawn at h6.
489,18,10,6Qd5,b'4q2k/8/p6p/P1PQ4/6PK/7P/8/8 b - -',Not the horrible 64. Qa6?? when Black gets a draw by perpetual check beginning with 64. ...Qe7.
490,18,11,6Kh5,b'7k/8/p1q4p/P1P2Q1K/6P1/7P/8/8 b - -',And suddenly the faintest glimmer of hope flares anew ...all I need is one move one move ....
491,18,12,6Kxh6,b'7k/8/p5QK/P1P1q3/6P1/7P/8/8 b - -',??? Sometimes I think there really might be a god ...at least a god of chess who watches over fish and fools like me.
492,18,13,6Qg5+,b'7k/8/p5QK/P1P3q1/6P1/7P/8/8 w - -',!!! Absolutely no credit for any other move!! White's only legal move is to take the Black Queen - and it doesn't matter whether he captures with Queen or King creating a stalemate. And so Black snatches the proverbial kiss from his sister from the jaws of sure defeat. ...Pretty cute.
493,19,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Normal.
494,19,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Sooner or later black needs to play g6 'cos his DSB is blocked.
495,19,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',d3 is usally a better move
496,19,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',In this position White's two knights prove very strong especially the d4-knight controlling the centre. Black should play e5 sending back the knight and developing his DSB. 
497,19,4,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Very popular move after the Silican defence as I explained.
498,19,5,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White's move is one that I have not encountered previously. That is because he is following a diffrent plan this time: he intends to castle Queen side. He therfore mobilizes his Queen-side forces more rapidly than he would ordinarily when contemplating King-side castling.
499,19,6,Qd2,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Supporting the bishop and preparing for Queenside castling (O-O-O)

501,19,8,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',We have now reached a point where we can fruitfully inquire into the logic behind White's Queen-side castling. As we have seen earlier the possibility of Pawn captures and recaptures is a very important factor in planning the course of a game. These captures and recaptures result in  line-opening. And this line-opening in turn creates highways for the movements of our forces in an aggressive mood. In this case White's basic tactical idea is to play h4 followed by h5 then PXP taking advantage of the fact that Black's King pawn is at g6. Once white has playe h5 he is certain of opening the h-file and having Black's address he will muster his heavy artukkery ib the newly-opened King Rook file to operate agianst Black's King.
502,19,9,Nb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',"This is the usual move made by White to avoid any tactical tricks due to the fact that White's knight at d4 was directly attacked by Black's Knight at c6 and indirectly attacked by the ""Dragon Bishop"" at g7."
503,19,10,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',And here is such an inexact move. Black should first play Re8!! so that he can answer 10. Bh6 with 10....Bh8!!! retaining the Dragon Bishop without any collisions
504,19,11,1Kb1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/1K1R1B1R b - -',But White is inexact too. Expoliting Black's last move he should play 10....Bh6!!!! forcing the removal of Black's precious Dragon Bishop (Obviously 10......Bh8? is answered by 11.BxR winning the exchange) The text has its points though. By playing Kb1 the white king protects the a2 pawn with another piece.
505,19,12,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/1K1R1B1R w - -',Again Black is wrong. Intent on prosecuting his counterattack he neglects to preserve his Dragon Bishop by playing Re8. 
506,19,13,1f3,b'2rq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN2P2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R1B1R b - -',Preparing to begin the Pawn-stroming attack with g4 followed by h4 and h5. But again White has negelected to remove the Dragon Bishop by Bh6.

508,19,15,Ne5,b'2rqr1k1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/4n1B1/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPPQ3P/1K1R1B1R w - -',! Preparing for the powerful infiltration.....Nc4; as we know occupying the aggresive outpost is one of the key features if Black's policy.
509,19,16,1Be2,b'2rqr1k1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/4n1B1/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPPQB2P/1K1R3R b - -',Now it has become clear that Black's threats are maturing more rapidily than White's. Yes what use is this move? Where's h4? If White has not begun to play h4 then what use is g4? Well we'll see as the game gets on. Anyhow Black can now play 13....Nc4 but instead he hints in a much more effective move.....
510,19,17,1Nfd7,b'2rqr1k1/pp1nppbp/3pb1p1/4n1B1/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPPQB2P/1K1R3R w - -',...Nfd7!! His idea is to play Nb6 after which he is certain of keeping a knight on c4 no matter how White proceeds. This is bound to be disatouras for White. Another useful point is that the Dragon Bishop is pointing directly for action against White's king!
511,19,18,1Bh6,b'2rqr1k1/pp1nppbp/3pb1pB/4n3/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPPQB2P/1K1R3R b - -',Too Late! The Dragon Bishop can now reatreat to two squares (h8 or f6 and not f8!)

His Queen and Rook are on the h-file which is about to open after PxP. But meanwhile Black has placed his forces in menacing postions and even at this stage he can shatter his opponet's postion with......Well can you guess?

519,19,26,1Nxb2,b'2rqr1kb/pp2pp1p/3pb3/6BP/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PnP4Q/1K1R3R w - -',Nxb2 is the answer!!!!!!!! Smashing up white's castled postion. The carefully prepared attack now bursts upon White's king with murderous force!
520,19,27,Rxc3,b'3qr1kb/pp2pp1p/3pb3/6BP/4P1P1/1Nr2P2/PKP4Q/3R3R w - -',! Even stronger is BxN+ for by threatening a fearsome double check-RxN+. Black gains time for increasing pressure on the c-file.
521,19,28,Qc7,b'4r1kb/ppq1pp1p/3pb3/6BP/4P1P1/1Nr2P2/P1P4Q/1K1R3R w - -',!! Black does not bother with the gain of a Pawn (21....Rxf3) as he wants to win in the quickest manner.

525,19,32,2a4,b'4r1kb/1pq1pp1p/3pb3/7P/p3P1P1/1Nr2P2/P1PQ4/1KBR3R w - -',Chasing the protective but poor knight away. Sorry Knight.

This time a swarm seemed to work.  I was proud to play this deeply into a territorial battle against a much higher-rated opponent here. I play white and comments most welcome!

550,20,4,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppppp/1p3n2/6B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',For the next few moves both sides develop freely basically ignoring each other it seems.

As I said I get the idea of a pawn storm I just don't know how to make one work in a time-efficient way.  However I felt that there was some time to spare here--I felt that my kingside defences were relatively resilient and took the time to complete a full-on pawn storm.
558,20,12,1d5,b'1k1r1b1r/pbpnqp2/1p2pn1p/3p2p1/1PPP4/2NBPNBP/P4PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?  Did Black push the wrong pawn here?  This move blocks his finacetto bishop although I suppose  12...e5 can be met by  13. d5 and the result is the same.  Perhaps 12...Nh5 followed by f5 and attempting a kingside breakthrough was a better plan for black.  As it is this allowed...
559,20,13,1c5,b'1k1r1b1r/pbpnqp2/1p2pn1p/2Pp2p1/1P1P4/2NBPNBP/P4PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',...and his finacetto bishop is out of the game while my DSB is looking great and the pawns are starting to do their job.

683,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Simple and strong. White takes control of important central squares and prepares to develop his light squared bishop.
684,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian defence.
685,23,2,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White attacks the c5 pawn with his queen but ignores the opening advice to not get the queen out early.
686,23,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Black counters the threat to the c5 pawn by attacking the e4 pawn and white's queen. This is also a developing move so this further takes advantage of the move white has just wasted in getting out the queen.
687,23,4,Qh4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',3. Qxc5 Nxe4 doesn't look great for white so instead white chooses to defend the e4 pawn.
688,23,5,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5n2/2p3p1/4P2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq g6',! Black forces white to give up the e pawn and in return offers his less powerful g pawn (in general center pawns are worth slightly more than wing pawns).
689,23,6,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/8/2p3Q1/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',The white queen is attacked again and now has to retreat 
690,23,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5n2/2p5/8/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',If white now continued with developing moves such as Nf3 Be2 and Nc3 He would probably be OK but black would have slightly more central control and a slight lead in development. However what if white decides to be greedy and pick off the undefended c5 pawn?
691,23,8,Qxc5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5n2/2Q5/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',So now white is a pawn up but has not developed a single minor piece and it is already move 6. Black's plan should now be similar to most gambit lines: Aim for rapid development and start an attack. In this particular position the exposed white queen will make a great target.
692,23,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2n2/2Q5/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',So black develops his other knight and attacks the central dark squares.
693,23,10,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2n2/2Q5/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq d3',White makes another non-developing move but at least this one opens up lines for the dark squared bishop and attacks the center.
694,23,11,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2n2n2/2Qp4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq d6',Black blocks any further advance of white's d pawn and prepares to develop the light squared bishop.

It is one thing to win a piece and think that you are winning.  However if your opponent chooses to keep his king upright you have work to do.  You may even start wondering where do I go from here?  If your opponent has a higher rating from you you may even be tempted to hit that Offer Draw button particularly if you have lost a ""won"" position three material points up (I am still haunted by that loss against Expert Charleshiggie!) against that opponent in the past.  However before you get your mits on that Offer Draw button it may well pay to take a deep breath count to ten and start coming up with some kind of strategy to perhaps make a move which you think will strengthen your position further so that you may force greater material gains or even return some of the won material to simplify into a won endgame.  This is what Yours Truly ended up doing in this endgame.  The opening is for the record The Ruy Lopez."

754,25,18,3a4,b'8/5p1p/5p2/1K6/P7/8/1P2kPPP/8 b - a3',36. a4 - I now set up a series of conditional moves to illustrate the point of my last note.
755,25,19,f5,b'8/5p1p/P7/1K3p2/8/8/1P4kP/8 w - -',38. ..... f5 - but he doesn't take the h pawn at once.  He is sending down his frontal f passer.  Thankfully the Wicked Witch of the West will not have time to make an appearance on the board but it is a close run thing.
756,25,20,4a8=Q+,b'Q7/5p1p/8/1K6/5p2/8/1P4kP/8 b - -',40. a8/Q+ - and now Glenda does appear in a combo of smoke and a huge fanfare of trumpets.  She fixes her glare on the BK.  Black blocks the check with his f pawn but now Glenda moves to g8 on her broomstick and glares at the BK from there.
757,25,21,4Qxf7,b'8/5Q2/8/1K6/8/5p2/1P6/6k1 b - -',43. Qxf7 - two down one to go.

Interestingly enough if it hadn't been for my passer on b2 the game would have been a draw due to the fact that I would have to either allow that pawn to crown or stalemate the BK.  Thankfully as I have that b pawn I can now sacrifice Glenda for the f2 pawn and then crown the b2 pawn.
759,25,23,4Kc6,b'8/8/2K5/8/1P6/4k3/8/8 b - -',46. Kc6 - up we go!

761,25,25,Ka5,b'8/1P6/2K5/k7/8/8/8/8 w - -',49. ..... Ka5 - black is voluntarily putting his king on the side of the board hoping for a stalemate.  No chance.  Henry and Glenda know how to nail the BK.
762,25,26,Ka3,b'1Q6/8/8/2K5/8/k7/8/8 w - -',51. ..... Ka3 - the BK tries to escape but Henry is in hot pursuit.  Henry will catch him and the BK will receive the kiss of death from Glenda.  Just before this can happen black waves the white flag.  A good handy win which pushes me towards passing my previous best rating of 1858.  More to come but bye for now.  Joanne

764,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Standard opening move which gains control of important central squares and allows white to develop the light squared bishop.
765,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Carries the same advantages as white's move 1. e4
766,26,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This develops the bishop and takes white 1 step towards castling. So far no mistake has been made by either side.
767,26,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',A strong solid move. If white now plays 3. Nf3 black can play 3. ...Bc5 transposing to the Giuoco piano opening. 2. ...Nc6 is my recommended way of meeting 2. Bc4 but 2. ...Nf6 and 2. ...Bc5 are also playable.
768,26,4,Qh5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',"White now plays for a quick knockout by threatening 4. Qxf7#. This however violates the opening principle ""Don't get your queen out early"" so don't play it as white in any of your games!"
769,26,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',This move blocks the attack on f7 and also attacks white's queen. Note that it is essential to have the knight on c6 if you play this when defending against scholar's mate as otherwise White can play 4. Qxe5+ which would fork the king and rook.
770,26,6,Qf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',The retreat of the queen was forced but white is not done yet! Now the threat to f7 is renewed.

Now white is almost out of threatening moves and has already thrown away the small advantage that white has at the start of the game. However if white is still going to try for an f7 swindle then you may see...
772,26,8,g4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P1P1/5Q2/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq g3',...this move. It is very bad and white should lose the game now. 5. Qb3 is also bad and should be met with 5. ...d5. The idea behind 5. g4 is that white wants to advance the pawn to g5 and threaten the knight. If black then moves the knight then white checkmates on f7. However this move does nothing for the center or development and also cretaes serious kingside weaknesses.
773,26,9,Nd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2BnP1P1/5Q2/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',This move hits the white queen and c2. White can no longer maintain threats against f7.
774,26,10,Qd1,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2BnP1P1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White must move the queen and defend c2. 6. Qd3 d5 is similar.

776,26,12,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5np1/3pp3/3nP1P1/8/PPPPBP1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',7. exd5 Bg4 is no good either. The bishop retreats to a square where it may be able to help defend the white king.
777,26,13,Nxg4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/6p1/3pp3/3nP1n1/8/PPPPBP1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',A very strong move from black. This brings another piece into white's territory and helps to create threats around the white king. If white plays 8. Bxg4 hoping to win a piece for free then black replies 8. ...Bxg4 9. Qxg4 Nxc2+ 10. Kd1 Nxa1 and black is winning.
778,26,14,h3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/6p1/3pp3/3nP1n1/7P/PPPPBP2/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Trying to kick away the invasive knight but black has a very strong reply...

Kg2 would have prevented an immediate checkmating combo but black would have a winning attack anyway and it is a bit beyond the point of this annotation. The game could have continued 10. Kg2 dxe4 11. d3 Nf5 12. dxe4 Bc5 13. Bb5+ c6 14. Qe2 Qg3+ 15. Kf1 Nh4 and black is winning. After this blunder however black now has forced checkmating sequence.

783,27,0,Nb8,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I have not seen anything like that before.  Development delayed two moves...

GM Cyrano kindly invited me to a MT of his called Italian Coffee.  I am one of 4 players rated south of 2000 in this 11 player MT and two of those were Class A 1900+ players.  This is one of them.  I find myself in a KGA and I end up losing a piece for two pawns very early on in the game.  I managed to get a third pawn for a piece but alas that proved to be insufficent in the endgame and Yours Truly had to take a 7 point rating hit preventing me from getting my rating north of 1860.  How did this happen?  Well here is the GA version of the game which you can follow.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16652944&fb=1&rnd=0.6964235451517038"
792,28,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. .... exf4 - this is the King's Gambit Accepted.  I usually accept the offering because a pawn is a pawn.

I am about to drop my knight for two pawns thanks to a check which I overlooked from the Wicked Witch of the West.  The best I can do is block the check but the knight then falls to a pin on d5 ouch and double ouch!!
796,28,5,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1pb1/2np3p/1B4p1/Q3P3/2P2NP1/PP6/RNB2RK1 w - -',14. .... 0-0 - after the dust has settled instead of toppling Henry I decided to tuck him away on the kingside out of the a4-e8 pin line.  Even though the end result proved to be a jstevens1 loss I think I made the right decision here in playing on.  At least it led to an interesting material imbalance of the three pawns for the piece and opens up a debate on which is better - a piece or three pawns but that happened later.

799,28,8,Be6,b'r4rk1/ppp2pb1/2npb2p/5qp1/8/2P2NP1/PP3Q2/RNB1RBK1 w - -',19. ..... Be6 - clearing the decks.

802,28,11,Re5,b'r5k1/1ppB1p2/p2p3p/4r1p1/8/2P3P1/PP3K2/R3R3 w - -',28. ..... Re5 - after another plethora of exchanges I am still endeavouring to keep my pawns intact.  In retrospect I should have got in h4 asap (I would have avoided this pawn becoming backward later on) and tried to force an exchange of one of my kingside pawns for the g3 pawn.  If I had succeeded in doing that then my drawing chances would have increased tenfold.
803,28,12,dxe5,b'r5k1/1ppB1p2/p6p/4p1p1/8/2P3P1/PP3K2/R7 w - -',29. ..... dxe5 - one pair of rooks is exchanged off.
804,28,13,Kg7,b'3r4/1pp2pk1/p6p/4pBp1/8/2P3P1/PP2K3/R7 w - -',31. ..... Kg7?? - I think this is where I sould have played h4.  White stops this with g4 next move and ensures that both my h and f pawns become backward.
805,28,14,f6,b'3r4/2p3k1/pp3p1p/4pBp1/6P1/2P1K3/PP6/R7 w - -',33. ..... f6 - moving all my pawns onto squares of the opposite colour to the WB but this will not do.
806,28,15,3cxb4,b'3r4/2p3k1/1p3p1p/4pBp1/PP4P1/4K3/8/R7 b - -',36. cxb4 - this pawn trade will ensure that white has a decisive outside passer.
807,28,16,3bxa5,b'r7/2p3k1/5p1p/P3pBp1/6P1/4K3/8/R7 b - -',38. bxa5 - voila!
808,28,17,Kf8,b'5k2/r1p5/P4p1p/4pBp1/6P1/4K3/8/R7 w - -',39. ....... Kf8 - Henry tries to go over to the queenside.  Sadly even with his healthy seafood diet he is still an old man and can only move one square at a time so he will be very hard push to be in two places at once.
809,28,18,4Bd3,b'5k2/r1p5/P4p1p/4p1p1/6P1/3BK3/8/R7 b - -',40. Bd3 - the pawn on a6 is now protected.  I must now watch out for Rb1 - b7 and the WK coming in via e4-f5 etc.  Henry cannot deal with both matters and two moves later I waved the white flag.  A chastening experience.
810,28,19,Kf7,b'8/r1p2k2/P4p1p/4p1p1/4K1P1/3B4/8/R7 w - -',
811,29,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So here we are at the start of my game against lougri. I felt like I could conquer the whole world well at least every chessplayer on Gameknot having won my first 7 games on the server (including a mate in 7!). I'm an e4-player but try to experiment with some openings on gameknot exploring whether 1d4 might be a good choice in real games.
812,29,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So of course I am not familiar with this opening. I sank into thoughts (which no-one notices on gameknot). I was wondering about 3.dxe5dxc4 4.Qd8:Kd8: and expected to have a small plus. However after for example 5.e4Nc6 6.f4 (or Nf3)Nb4 I wasn't able to find my plus anymore. It seemed that black was ok because he wins a tempo on my e5-pawn or something. And besides that 3...dxc4 isn't even forced. So an alternative.
813,29,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm not so sure about this move.
814,29,3,Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',This was the first moment of happiness in this game for me. I didn't believe that black should place his bishop on this rather inactive square to win the pawn. In fact I was a little bit happy to sacrifice it.
815,29,4,Bg5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bn2/6B1/1bpP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',At least some active play and it's hard to move the e6-bishop because of the c4-pawn. However I didn't like my isolani on the d-file.
816,29,5,c6,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1bn1p/8/1bpP3B/2N2N2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Threatening b5. I have a choice now to continue the position with a pawn down and activate my pieces (Rac1 Rfd1 b3 and Ne4) or try to regain the pawn immediately with Ne4. I think I made the wrong choice.
817,29,6,Be7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1bn1p/8/2pPN2B/5N2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I don't really know what I planned on b5 but in the game I didn't like this retreat. It forces me to exchange my active pieces against black less active ones. But at least I'm regaining my pawn.
818,29,7,1Rfd1,b'r3r1k1/pp1n1pp1/2p1bq1p/8/2BP4/5N2/PPQ2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Judging the finish of the game it might have been better to exchange the light-squared bishops.

820,29,9,1Re7,b'r5k1/pp1nrpp1/2p2q1p/8/3P2b1/5N2/PPQ1BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',18.h3Bf5 19.Bd3Bh3:
821,29,10,Rae8,b'4r1k1/pp1nrpp1/2p2q1p/8/3P2b1/5N2/PPQRBPPP/R5K1 w - -',Threatening Bf3:. I kinda missed that again planned h3 but that's still not working. Also Ne5 isn't enough. Black is more active and has a healthier pawn structure. 
822,29,11,Bxf3,b'4r1k1/pp1nrpp1/2p2q1p/8/3P4/5b2/PPQRBPPP/R4K2 w - -',Didn't see that one coming either.
823,29,12,Qf4,b'4r1k1/pp1nrpp1/2p4p/8/3P1q2/5B2/PPQR1PPP/R4K2 w - -',I'd love to play d5 but always got into Ne5 which seemed to ruin the last of my defence

825,29,14,2Ne4,b'4r1k1/pp2rpp1/2p4p/5Q2/3Pn3/5BP1/PP1R1P1q/3R1K2 w - -',but this move was already awkward. 24.Be4:Re4: 25.Qf3Qh3 26.Qg2Re1 already loses. Since Re2 fails on Ng3: my last defence was Rc2. Then 24...Qg3:? 25.Be4: would be embarrassing but also 24...Ng3: 25.fg3: is not that clear fpr black as the white queen suddenly defends his companion on c2 again. I really loved this discovered defence. Nevertheless again I completely missed black's best move....
826,29,15,Qxf2+,b'4r1k1/pp2rpp1/2p4p/5Q2/3Pn3/5BP1/PPR2q2/3R1K2 w - -',"Ai was that a threat as well.....
Good game by my opponent brought me back with two feets on the ground. The end of a beautiful winning streak of 7 games but of course it is also the start of a new winning streak which hopefully lasts more than 7 games this time."
827,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game my opponent got bottled up early and never recovered. Some instructive missed opportunities including a forced mate for White.

So I started looking at Bg5 then what? If he replies Be7 I can exchange bishops and maybe my knights can manoeuvre to d3 and/or e4 and maybe into c5 and/or d6. This may be hard to counter. If he doesn't play Be7 how on earth is he going to develop his Bf8 and play 0-0? Yes Bg5 looks good....

931,33,1,1Kb1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2bp1n1p/8/3QP2B/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - -',This should have lost me a pawn after 11...Nxe4! 12. Bxe7 Nxc3+ 13. Qxc3 Qxe7 14. Rhe1 Qd8 15. Ne5?! Be8! Better for white was 11. Rhe1.
932,33,2,f6,b'r4rk1/pppnq1p1/2bp1p1p/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 w - -',Black seems to have no plan. His white squares are very weak now and they will be weaker after the following exchange.
933,33,3,1Qg4,b'r4rk1/pppn1qp1/3p1p1p/3P4/6Q1/5N2/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 b - -',Keeping an eye on the weak e6 square -- and on the King!
934,33,4,1Nb6,b'r4rk1/ppp2qp1/1n1p1p1p/3P4/6Q1/5N2/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 w - -',Black probably should have challenged the e-file with Rae8.
935,33,5,1Nd4,b'r4rk1/ppp2qp1/1n1p1p1p/3P4/3N2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 b - -',Black will fall right into the trap. He sees that the knight is aimed at e6 so he eliminates one of the supports.
936,33,6,1Nxd5,b'r4rk1/ppp2qp1/3p1p1p/3n4/3N2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 w - -',Maybe 17...f5 was necessary.
937,33,7,1Nf5,b'r4rk1/ppp2qp1/3p1p1p/3n1N2/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/1K1RR3 b - -',Ta-da! This knight will have quite an adventure in this game. The deadly threat of course is 19. Nxh6+ winning the queen.
938,33,8,1Rxd5,b'r4r2/ppp2qpk/3p1p1p/3R1N2/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/1K2R3 b - -',But black overlooked this threat! He can't recapture because of mate at g7.
939,33,9,1Rae8,b'4rr2/ppp2qpk/3p1p1p/3R1N2/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/1K2R3 w - -',Finally!
940,33,10,2Qc4,b'4r3/ppp2q1k/3p2pp/5p2/2Q5/4N3/PPP2PPP/1K1R4 b - -',White now just wants to simplify and reach a favorable endgame.
941,33,11,2Nd5,b'4r3/pppq3k/3p2pp/3N1p2/2Q5/8/PPP2PPP/1K1R4 b - -',Ouch! Now white threatens 25. Nf6+ netting the queen. Black should have played 23....Qg7.
942,33,12,Kf6,b'8/8/2N2k1p/1p4p1/p4p2/3K4/PPP2PPP/8 w - -',He should play 38...Kf5 challenging white's King which now marches to the center.
943,33,13,4h4,b'8/8/5k2/6pp/pp1NKp1P/8/PPP2PP1/8 b - h3',As good a way as any to break up his only advantage the K-side pawn majority.
944,33,14,h3,b'8/8/5k2/7p/pp1N1K2/7p/PPP2PP1/8 w - -',It's hard to see the use of this move unless it's to break up white's connected pawns.
945,33,15,4c4,b'8/8/6k1/7p/ppPN1K2/7P/PP3P2/8 b - c3',Now the Q-side majority springs into action. I expected 44...bxc4e.p. 45. bxc3 Kf6 which would gain black a tempo.
946,33,16,Ke7,b'8/4k3/8/2P4p/pp1N1K2/7P/PP3P2/8 w - -',A curious position. White's c-pawn is unreachable! Black would first have to trade off a Q-side pawn and march the King around to d7-c7-b7-a6-a5-b4 getting behind the white c-pawn at which point it could safely outrun the black King anyway.
947,33,17,h4,b'8/4k3/8/2P1K3/pp1N3p/7P/PP3P2/8 w - -',Black appears to be trying to lock the position and going for stalemate his only hope.

1006,37,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',? This is the Dunst Opening but it is also a blunder.  I understand the logic behind this move.  Mark wants to develop his minor pieces in the beginning.  Jack Stockel has told me that it is important to develop your minor pieces during the beginning game but not on your first move.  Otherwise it destroys the center (prevents you from controlling the center) so the Dunst Opening is not studied by masters and grandmasters.  According to Mr. Stockel you are supposed to play openings that are studied by masters and grandmasters.  However Jack agrees with ION's assessment about the Nimovitz Defense.  In Other Words he says that it is ok to develop on your first move if you are playing the Nimovitz Defense.  On the other hand this is not the Nimovitz Defense so Mario has an advantage in this position.
1007,37,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',One would think that this is the King's Pawn Game.  For the King's Pawn Game however 1.e4e5 must be played.  Therefore I do not know what this is called.
1008,37,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',In my opinion the Dunst Opening has transposed into the King's Pawn Game.
1009,37,3,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? You are generally supposed to develop your knight before your bishops unless you have an immediate tactical advantage by developing your bishop before your knights.  However this does not give Mario an advantage in this position.  If I were black I would want to play 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6.  I think that I would prefer 2...Nf6 because it brings you one step closer to castling Kings Side.
1010,37,4,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',! This is solid because Rick developed his LSB after his knight.
1011,37,5,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',! Mario made this move so that he could castle Kings Side.  Therefore this is a good choice in my opinion.  I understand this position because I usually try to castle Kingside ASAP.  
1012,37,6,Qf3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',? This is a mistake.  According to general opening principles you are not supposed to develop your queen so early.  Therefore white has skipped the basics in my opinion.
1013,37,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',I am not sure if this was a good move.  As I had mentioned earlier I usually want to castle Kingside as soon as I can.  However I might not want to castle in this circumstance.  That is because Rick brought his queen out on move 4.  I am not sure what other alternatives I would consider in this position.
1014,37,8,d3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQ -',! At first I did not why Rick chose this candidate.  However I quickly figured out that Rick moved his d2 pawn to pin Mario's g5 knight.  That will give him a winning advantage and I will explain that shortly.
1015,37,9,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/3b1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ c6',?? I do not know why Mario made this move but 5...Qg3 would have been his best move as it would have prevented a pin.  I believe however that Mario is starting to panic.  
1016,37,10,Nb5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/3b1n2/1Np1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQ -',Rick decided not to Fianchetto immediately because he wanted to chase Mario's DSB and force Mario to play 6...Be7 so it is ok.  However I believe that it would have been better if white pinned Mario's knight on this move but Mark will play the pin shortly.
1017,37,11,Bc7,b'rnbq1rk1/ppbp1ppp/5n2/1Np1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',?? Eventhough the game is not lost for black Mario is in serious trouble.  Even 6...Be7??  Once again Qg3 would have been much better.  At this point Rick will pin Mario's piece with 7.Bg5.  In the meantime Mario is getting more worried about the position and it is overwhelming his defenses.
1018,37,12,a6,b'rnbq1rk1/1pbp1ppp/p4n2/1Np1p1B1/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',"?? In my opinion this was Mario's loosing blunder because Mark will be able to find an inevitable mating solution in this position.  Therefore 7...h6 would have been Rick's best move and if 8.Bh4 8...g5.  This would however lead to a King exposure but ""'There is always an exception to everything""' as chesskingdom64 would say.  This was one of those exceptions.  That is because 7...h6 8...g5 breaks the pin.  At this point however Mario is as nervous as you can get and it has caused him to loose concentration."
1019,37,13,Nc3,b'rnbq1rk1/1pbp1ppp/p4n2/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',"In this position however Rick is forced to retreat his knight but the game is almost lost for black.  I believe that Mario is less anxious but ""the damage has already been done"" as it is said."
1020,37,14,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/1pb2ppp/p2p1n2/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',I do not know why Mario chose this candidate.
1021,37,15,Qg3,b'rnbq1rk1/1pb2ppp/p2p1n2/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',!! Rick made this move to pin Mario's g7 pawn.  This brings Rick one step closer to a the mating pattern that I had mentioned earlier.  In my history of playing chess I have not been able to find a mating solution with a pin.
1022,37,16,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/1pb2pp1/p2p1n1p/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',"?? Mario chose this candidate because he thought that it would break the pin.  At this point he has regained his confidence but it is still ""too little too late"" as it is said.  In most cases this is a way to break a pin but ""not this time"" as they say.  In addition Rick will win a pawn with 10.Bxh6 with this pin.  However Mario will still be pinned."
1023,37,17,g6,b'rnbq1rk1/1pb2p2/p2p1npB/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',?? Therefore Mario makes this move but is a serious blunder.  I initially thought that Rick would win a free rook with 11.Bxf8 but it is far worse then that.  In fact the game is now officially lost for Mario because Rick now has an official mating against black.  Therefore Rick will mate Mario in two moves with 11.Qxg6 Kh8 (forced) 12.Qg7#  
1024,37,18,1Qg7#,b'rnbq1r1k/1pb2pQ1/p2p1n1B/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',It is generally a bad idea to get in nervous in a chess game.  When you become anxious you do not concentrate.  Therefore you overlook immediate danger including mating threats.  However you can overcome obstacles and prevent stress by believing in yourself.  If you believe in yourself you can quickly solve problems in most cases.
