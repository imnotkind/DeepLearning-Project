125,2,12,fxe5,b'r2q3r/pp3kpp/8/1Bb1p3/5nbB/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',good move by black but too late
126,2,13,Qc8,b'r1q4r/pp3kpp/8/1Bb1p3/5nQB/2P5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',black tries to even the pieces and take some pressure of the king

133,3,4,bxc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',white still has the center but black should have taken the pawn on e4

148,3,19,Nb7,b'r2q2k1/pn3r1p/1p2Q1p1/3p4/8/3B4/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',good pin and black knight is coming to help with the defense
149,3,20,2Qh3,b'r2q2k1/p4r1p/1p4pB/2np4/8/3B3Q/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',white should have moved his queen to g5 and threaten to take g6 with bishop sacrifice
150,3,21,2Bb5,b'r5k1/p4r1p/1p3qpB/1Bnp4/8/7Q/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',white bishop on b5 is passive

152,3,23,2Nd2,b'r5k1/p4r1p/1p3qpB/1B1p4/8/5P1Q/P2n2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Bxd2 is the correct move. too bad white did not spend more time analsying the position

158,4,0,Qd5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3q4/2pP4/5NP1/PPQ1PP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',!? This is a move not seen that often
159,4,1,Qe4,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1bpPq3/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',?? This simply drops a piece.
160,4,2,Qd2,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1bpPq3/2N2NP1/PP1QPPBP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',?? White can immediately win a piece with 8.Qa4+! Nc6 9.Nh4! Qg4 10.Bxc6+.
161,4,3,Bxc3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pPq3/2b2NP1/PP1QPPBP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',?! This just releases all the pressure. Black should have simply retreated his queen instead of playing this move. Now white will have no trouble developing his queenside.
162,4,4,Qxc3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pPq3/2Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',!
163,4,5,Qh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppB2ppp/2n1pn2/7q/2pP4/2Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',?! This simply unnecessarily drops another whole pawn although it threatens ...Nd5.
164,4,6,1Qxc4,b'r1b2rk1/ppB2ppp/2n1pn2/7q/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',! Simple and best.
165,4,7,1Bd6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2nBp3/3n3q/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 b - -',!?
166,4,8,f6,b'r1br2k1/pp4pp/1nn1pp2/7q/3P4/B1Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',?! An unnecessary waste of time.
167,4,9,e5,b'r1br2k1/pp4pp/1nn2p2/4p2q/3P4/B1Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 w - -',This now shows the justification for black's previous move but black's development is lagging.
168,4,10,1d5,b'r1br2k1/pp4pp/1nn2p2/3Pp2q/8/B1Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 b - -',? This sacrifices a pawn to open up the position but this is however unnecessary. White should have continued with the simple 18.dxe5.
169,4,11,1Rxd5,b'r1b3k1/pp4pp/1nn2p2/3rp2q/8/B1Q2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 w - -',? The simple 18...Nxd5! would have been much better as white has no attack after 19.Qc5!? Be6! 20. e4 Nb6! 21.Rxd8+ Rxd8. However this gives a pawn back by force.
170,4,12,2Qb3,b'r1b3k1/pp4pp/2n2p2/3np2q/8/BQ3NP1/PP2PPBP/R5K1 b - -',! This is the only move winning the pawn back as after 20.Qc4 black has 20...Be6! 21.e4 Nf4! when forced is 22.Qc3 as 22.Qa4 loses to 22...Nxg2 23.Kxg2 Bh3+. Here 20...Be6 loses to 21.Qxb7.
171,4,13,2Qf7,b'r1b3k1/pp3qpp/2n2p2/3np3/8/BQ3NP1/PP2PPBP/R5K1 w - -',?? This is a losing move due to the tactical shot played on the next move. Black should have given up a pawn with 20...Be6 21.Qxb7 Rc8.
172,4,14,2Nxe5,b'r1b3k1/pp3qpp/2n2p2/3nN3/8/BQ4P1/PP2PPBP/R5K1 b - -',! The white bishop attacks black's d5- knight while the e5-knight attack's black's queen. Black cannot prevent loss of material.
173,4,15,2Nd4,b'r1b3k1/pp3qpp/5p2/3nN3/3n4/BQ4P1/PP2PPBP/R5K1 w - -',Honestly I had not seen this as an option for black! However I still was able to refute it.
174,4,16,2Bxd5,b'r1b3k1/pp3qpp/5p2/3BN3/3n4/BQ4P1/PP2PP1P/R5K1 b - -',!
175,4,17,2Nxf7,b'r5k1/pp3Npp/4bp2/3B4/3n4/BQ4P1/PP2PP1P/R5K1 b - -',!
176,4,18,2Ba4,b'r7/pp3kpp/4bp2/8/B7/B5P1/PP2PP1P/R5K1 b - -',?! I just wanted to keep the bishop pair when I played this. However I see nothing wrong with 25.Bxe6+ Kxe6 26.Rc1. Now white will have to use some time to develop his rook withoug losing a pawn.
177,4,19,2Rb8,b'1r6/pp3kpp/4bp2/8/B7/B5P1/PP2PP1P/R5K1 w - -',! This move is the only move to delay the rook's development even further.
178,4,20,2b3,b'1r6/pp3kpp/4bp2/8/B7/BP4P1/P3PP1P/R5K1 b - -',?? I blitzed out this move without thinking about its consequences. I got my punishment!
179,4,21,2b5,b'1r6/p4kpp/4bp2/1p6/B7/BP4P1/P3PP1P/R5K1 w - b6',! Now the a4-bishop is trapped.
180,4,22,Ra5,b'8/p4kpp/4bp2/r7/8/BP4P1/P3PP1P/2R3K1 w - -',?! This  makes the rook more or less out of play.
181,4,23,3Bf8,b'5B2/p1R3pp/4bpk1/r7/8/1P4P1/P3PP1P/6K1 b - -',!? But my opponent found a slick solution
182,4,24,3Bf7,b'5B2/p1R2bpp/5pk1/r7/8/1P4P1/P3PP1P/6K1 w - -',! This is the only move that will temporarily hold. I still remember wondering if I could even win at this point.
183,4,25,Rd5,b'5B2/2R2bpp/p4pk1/3r4/P6P/1P4P1/4PP2/6K1 w - -',Finally the rook is back to doing something.
184,4,26,3f3,b'5B2/2R2bpp/p4pk1/3r4/P6P/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 b - -',!?  I was secretly thinking about playing something like Kf2 and e4 to TRY to get the rook off the 5th rank.
185,4,27,3Rd8,b'3r1B2/2R2bpp/p4pk1/8/P6P/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 w - -',? Now I get my piece back! The rook was required on the 5th-rank to prevent h5+.
186,4,28,3h5+,b'3r1B2/2R2bpp/p4pk1/7P/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 b - -',!
187,4,29,3Kxh5,b'3r1B2/2R2bpp/p4p2/7k/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 w - -',Forced.
188,4,30,Kg6,b'3r1B2/5Rpp/p4pk1/8/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 w - -',Now this was another surprise to me but to those masters: What do I know?
189,4,31,3Rf7,b'3r1B2/5R1p/p4p2/5k2/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 b - -',?! 
190,4,32,3Be7,b'3r4/4BR2/p4p2/5k1p/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 b - -',!? Although this (again) drops a piece I will not consider it bad as it liquidates into an easily winning pawn endgame that may be even more advantageous than being a piece up.
191,4,33,3Rd7,b'8/3rBR2/p4p2/5k1p/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 w - -',A pin!
192,4,34,3Rxf6+,b'8/3rB3/p4R2/5k1p/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 b - -',Of course.
193,4,35,3Ke5,b'8/3rB3/p4R2/4k2p/P7/1P3PP1/4P3/6K1 w - -',Only now did I realize I would be forced to give up a piece as 40.Rf7? loses to 40...Ke6!
194,4,36,Rxe2,b'8/8/8/7R/P2k4/1P3PP1/4r3/6K1 w - -',I am now in an easily winning rook-and-pawn endgame.
195,4,37,4Rh2,b'8/8/8/8/P2k4/1P3PP1/4r2R/6K1 b - -',I didn't know what I was thinking but this (of course) doesn't change the result.
196,4,38,Kd3,b'8/8/8/8/PP6/3krPP1/5K1R/8 w - -',!?
197,4,39,4Kg3,b'8/8/8/8/PP4P1/3k1PK1/4r2R/8 b - -',All other moves lose.
198,4,40,4Rg2,b'8/8/8/8/PP4P1/3k1PK1/6R1/4r3 b - -',!? I was thinking of supporting my kingside pawns and giving up my queenside ones. I chose to use the rook instead of the king and instead of letting the pawns support themselves.
199,4,41,Rb4,b'8/8/8/1P6/Pr4P1/3k1PK1/6R1/8 w - -',White loses a pawn unless he playes 50.Ra2 but it doesn't matter.
200,4,42,5b6,b'8/8/1P6/r5P1/8/3k1P2/6RK/8 b - -',! Making black waste another tempo trying to attack the pawn.
201,4,43,5g7,b'8/6P1/1r6/8/8/3k1P2/6RK/8 b - -',You may all think I bombed this endgame but it's just because I was impatient. At least I didn't throw away the win!
202,4,44,5Kg2,b'6R1/8/8/8/8/4kP2/6K1/8 b - -',This was another blitzed out move. I maybe should have played 57.Kg3 instead.
203,4,45,5Rf8+,b'5R2/8/8/8/5k2/5P2/6K1/8 b - -',And now the rook is supporting the f-pawn. Black resigned.

294,9,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"I am currently teaching myself the ""Stone Wall Attack"" and all of the variations. This is just one of the many games I am using to practice this opening. My opponent doesn't follow what I felt he would do and you'll see that I abandon the Stone Wall pretty early.

However I lose some momentum and material early and feel that I should have lost this game do to some poor decisions on my part. My opponent doesn't take advantage of his two Bishops vs. my two Knight late and makes what a feel was a fatal error with a trade. 

My opponent also either lost focus or completely undervalued pawns later and allowed me to crawl back into this game and ultimately win.

I give myself credit for hanging in and getting the Win but some bad decisions should have sunk me pretty early on.

Here we go.

D4 - Typical opening for The Stone Wall. I'm expecting Nc6 or d5.


"
295,9,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nf6 - I think he is going for center control early w/out any pawn structure or help.
296,9,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I ignore the Nf6 and continue w/ the typical stone wall pawn structure. I don't like that he is already threatening e4 but w/out the pawns opening the middle he is falling behind in momentum.
297,9,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"g6- Uh oh I Know I've seen this somewhere before... I'm perplexed as this doesn't open up the middle for black and w/ my pawns on Black if he fienchetto's his biship or even brings it to the H file he is blocked. I am bummed however as the pawn on G6 will effect my intended attack w/ the Stone Wall.

This should have been my first clue to drop the stone wall and adjust my opening. "
298,9,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',However as I am extremely new w/ this opening I know vary little variations and sadly continued to plunge on forward w/ Bd3. A better move might have been to Fienchetto my own bishop to g2 and take control of the long light squared diagonal that is unobstructed.
299,9,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Bg7 - Black is still way behind in development. I think this allowed me to build a false sense of security w/ all of my advancement.
300,9,6,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',e4 - At this point I realize that my stone wall will not work and attempt to adjust my strategy a bit. My aim was to kick the knight off of f6 and to further hem in the Bishop on g7. However I should have kept him home for a few more moves and developed my two knights first.
301,9,7,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',d6 - Black finally comes to the party... This prevents me from being able to kick the knight off of F6. Just the beginning of my pains.
302,9,8,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',"Bg5 - Not sure what I was thinking here. I'm losing momentum and don't even realize it. Throwing away moves that should be used to develop pieces such as my two knights. This ""threat"" does nothing to deter Black."
303,9,9,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Nd7 - Develops and protects in move. Black has easily gained in momentum and I am disjointed to say the least. No support protection or clear attacking lanes. My starting idea of using the Stone Wall has quickly fallen into Ciaos. While Black is a little bottled up and I am more open I feel that I should lose this game based on this position alone.  
304,9,10,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Nf3- Hey I wake up and decide to bring in some protection.

Neither of us has attacked yet so maybe he is leaving himself some options to castle Queen side. I felt that him getting his King to safety or opening up the middle was the better option here as it would have allowed him to take advantage of my poor support and positioning.
306,9,12,e5,b'r1bqk2r/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/4P1B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',e5- In my mind probably the worst move so far this game. Again I have neglected to develop pieces. Should have Castled here or Nbd2. Both moves would have gave needed support to the middle and possibly hid my King. I could be wrong but I feel that this was the down turn in the game for me.
307,9,13,Be4,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Be4 - Again... I see this as a poor decision. I attack Ra8 but neglect to defend e5 while exposing my queen. I'm starting to see patience as a issue in my game.
308,9,14,Rb8,b'1rbqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQk -',Rb8 - I won the ability to move the rook and prevent Queen side castling... Which is not even a remote possibility here. I'm giving away momentum in this game.
309,9,15,1Nc3,b'1rbqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQk -',Nc3- I think I just missed the double attack on e5 winning Black a pawn and attacking my queen at the same time.
310,9,16,1f6,b'1rbqk1nr/p1pnp1bp/1p3pp1/4P1B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQk -',f6- Not sure but White just couldn't pull the trigger on snatching the pawn. Maybe Black wanted to kick the Bishop off of the G5 Square.
311,9,17,Ngxf6,b'1rbqk2r/p1pnp1bp/1p3np1/6B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQk -',Ngxf6- Black didn't want to trade bishops and didn't seem to want to open the D file. Possilby feared the Queen exchange and having to recapture w/ the King which would totally prevent future Castling. 
312,9,18,1Bc6,b'1rbqk2r/p1pnp1bp/1pB2np1/6B1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQk -',Bc6- Again going in w/ guns blazing w/ no backup. My thought process was to keep black hemmed in a little longer. Again I am giving away momentum as Castling here would have been the better move.
313,9,19,1O-O,b'1rbq1rk1/p1pnp1bp/1pB2np1/6B1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',0-0 - Black totally negated my Knight Pin to his king. Black is tidy and well defended. However he is sorely behind in development.
314,9,20,1Qd2,b'1rbq1rk1/p1pnp1bp/1pB2np1/6B1/8/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Qd2- I'm wanting to take out the black bishop patrolling the long diagonal on dark squares.
315,9,21,1Nc5,b'1rbq1rk1/p1p1p1bp/1pB2np1/2n3B1/8/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',There it is. Black is now not afraid of the Queen trade once his King is tucked safely away.
316,9,22,1Bh6,b'1rbq1rk1/p1p1p1bp/1pB2npB/2n5/8/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Bh6.... Wow now that I look back on this game I can see why I lose the games that I do. My king is wide open my queen is being honed in on and I place another piece in harms way. Not a good move... Sadly the next one is much worse.
317,9,23,1Qxd2+,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1p1bp/1pB2npB/2n5/8/2N2N2/PPPq1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black trades and I make a stupid mistake.

319,9,25,1Bxh6,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1p2p/1pB2npb/2n5/8/2N5/PPPN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black is smiling now... I can feel it.
320,9,26,1Nc4,b'1rb2rk1/p1p1p2p/1pB2npb/2n5/2N5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Nc5- Now Unless I castle to the Queen side I have to move the Knight so that I can Castle next. No need to compound insult to injury here.
321,9,27,1Bf5,b'1r3rk1/p1p1p2p/1pB2npb/2n2b2/2N5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Bf5- Black smells blood in the water and is trying to pick me off one piece at a time. So what do I do? 
322,9,28,1Nb5,b'1r3rk1/p1p1p2p/1pB2npb/1Nn2b2/2N5/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Nb5- I attack one of Blacks two pawns in the 7th rank. I attempt a trade thinking that somehow that will make my blunderous move earlier any better. 
323,9,29,1e5,b'1r3rk1/p1p4p/1pB2npb/1Nn1pb2/2N5/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ e6',e5 - Up to this point black has played a very careful and solid game. I still am not sure why this move was made. I'm thinking he was baiting me into allowing him to pin my knight to my king. Fortunately I realized this before it was too late.
324,9,30,1O-O,b'1r3rk1/p1p4p/1pB2npb/1Nn1pb2/2N5/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',0-0 FINALLY!!! I get to safety! So I think. Now I have bead on 3 of Blacks Pawns I should get one on the next move.
325,9,31,1Nce4,b'1r3rk1/p1p4p/1pB2npb/1N2pb2/2N1n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Nce4- Curiously Black doesn't take his free pawn on c2 plus he temporarily blocks himself from it. Nor does he protect any of his threatened pawns. Its at this point that Black starts to slip in his advantage. Slowly but surely. Black undervalued the pawns in general. His and mine.
326,9,32,1Nxe5,b'1r3rk1/p1p4p/1pB2npb/1N2Nb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Nxe5 - So I take my ""free"" pawn. Plus I threaten the f7 square and limit the king. However my main goal is the split on the d7 square but the Bf5 is a thorn in my side."
327,9,33,1a6,b'1r3rk1/2p4p/ppB2npb/1N2Nb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',a6 - good move to kick the knight.
328,9,34,2Nxc7,b'1r3rk1/2N4p/ppB2npb/4Nb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Nxc7- Stacking my Knight and Bishop was a huge mistake and costs me a Bishop.
329,9,35,2Bd5+,b'2r2rk1/2N4p/pp3npb/3BNb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I don't want to lose a piece for nothing so I attempet to get black to trade.
330,9,36,2Nxd5,b'2r2rk1/2N4p/pp4pb/3nNb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Kxd5- Had Black move his king he could have gotten one of the bishop or knight for free w/ the trade. 
331,9,37,2Nxd5,b'2r2rk1/7p/pp4pb/3NNb2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Nxd5- Now I get out of my poor decision to stack the Knight and Bishop. However I am Bishopless so the end game should be interesting.
332,9,38,2Rxc2,b'5rk1/7p/pp4pb/3NNb2/4n3/8/PPr2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Rxc2- there goes that hanging pawn. At least Black recoups some interest.
333,9,39,Nxf2,b'5rk1/7p/pp4pb/3NNb2/8/1P6/P1r2nPP/R4RK1 w - -',Nxf2-Black uses a battering Ram to break through my defenses. 
334,9,40,Rxf2,b'5rk1/7p/pp4pb/3NNb2/8/1P6/P4rPP/R5K1 w - -',I'm not liking this look at all. Both of Blacks rooks on the F file? This could spell trouble.
335,9,41,2Ne7+,b'5rk1/4N2p/pp4pb/4Nb2/8/1P6/P4rPP/R5K1 b - -',Ne7+ The Rook isn't going anywhere so I decide to go on the offensive a bit. Blacks King can't push and Attack Ne7 because of the Knight on e5. so his only two options are h8 or g7.
336,9,42,2Kg7,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4pb/4Nb2/8/1P6/P4rPP/R5K1 w - -',g7... 
337,9,43,2Kxf2,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4pb/4Nb2/8/1P6/P4KPP/R7 b - -',kxf2 - I don't want to mess around any further wit that Rook. Need to nab him now before it is to late.
338,9,44,2Bd3+,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4pb/4N3/8/1P1b4/P4KPP/R7 w - -',Bd3 Reveals a hidden Check. 
339,9,45,2Kg1,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4pb/4N3/8/1P1b4/P5PP/R5K1 b - -',Back into my hole.
340,9,46,2Be3+,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4p1/4N3/8/1P1bb3/P5PP/R5K1 w - -',Be3- He wants to keep the initiative but he only pushes me further into my protection.
341,9,47,2Kh1,b'5r2/4N1kp/pp4p1/4N3/8/1P1bb3/P5PP/R6K b - -',W/ the Rook protecting the 1st rank I have no fear of Rf1++.
342,9,48,2Rf1+,b'8/4N1kp/pp4p1/4N3/8/1P1bb3/P5PP/R4r1K w - -',Apparently Black doesn't notice this or just wanted to trade rooks. I'm not sure which.
343,9,49,Bxf1,b'8/4N1kp/pp4p1/4N3/8/1P2b3/P5PP/5b1K w - -',Now comes the fun part. My two Knights vs. Blacks two Bishops. While we are equal numerically black has the advantage if his plays i correct as his bishops can control almost any square w/ this open board. Black should win imo.
344,9,50,3Ng4,b'8/4N1kp/pp4p1/8/6N1/1P2b3/P5PP/5b1K b - -',Ng4- So I apply some pressure hoping black makes a mistake w/ my knights. W/ Blacks light colored bishop hemmed in a bit by being on the 1st rank and behind my pawn it allows me to have a little more freedom to move.
345,9,51,3Nc6,b'8/6kp/ppN3p1/8/3b2N1/1P6/P5PP/5b1K b - -',Nc6 - Still applying the pressure. Don't allow Black to mount any kind of attack keep him focused on defending rather than advancing.
346,9,52,3h3,b'8/6kp/ppN3p1/2b5/6N1/1P5P/P5P1/5b1K b - -',h3- places all of my precious pawns on light colors and keeps the dark bishop out of the game.
347,9,53,3h5,b'8/6k1/ppN3p1/2b4p/6N1/1P5P/P5P1/5b1K w - h6',h5- Blunder move by Black. He should have advanced his king and kept him in front of his pawns rather than behind chasing.
348,9,54,3Nh2,b'8/6k1/ppN3p1/2b4p/8/1P5P/P5PN/5b1K b - -',Nh2- Again while retreating I still apply some pressure.
349,9,55,3Bb5,b'8/6k1/ppN3p1/1bb4p/8/1P5P/P5PN/7K w - -',Bb5- Black attempts the same thing however it only pushes me towards his king.
350,9,56,3Ne5,b'8/6k1/pp4p1/1bb1N2p/8/1P5P/P5PN/7K b - -',Ne5- putting the knight in the middle of the board hoping for a mistake from my opponent (who clearly isn't all that comfortable playing against knights in the end game) I'm also applying some pressure on g6 pawn.
351,9,57,3Bd6,b'8/6k1/pp1b2p1/1b2N2p/8/1P5P/P5PN/7K w - -',Bd6- At first glance this is a very powerful move as it pins my two pieces together. The flaw is that if Black takes he will be trading a Bishop for a Knight. In this type of game he can't afford to trade either of his bishops as I can just move all of my other pieces onto the opposite color. I will happily take that trade if offered. 
352,9,58,3Kxh2,b'8/6k1/pp4p1/1b5p/8/1P3N1P/P5PK/8 b - -',Kxh2 - So I take the offering. Even though the score is dead even I feel that I just a huge advantage. 
353,9,59,3Kh6,b'8/8/pp4pk/1b5p/8/1P3N1P/P5PK/8 w - -',Kh6 - Now he starts to advance the king. However he is blocked from going any further because of the knight.
354,9,60,3Kg3,b'8/8/pp4pk/1b5p/8/1P3NKP/P5P1/8 b - -',Kg3- I further enforce my control over the pawns. Black cannot enter this area. 
355,9,61,3Kf4,b'8/6k1/pp4p1/7p/1P3K2/3b1N1P/P5P1/8 b - -',Kf4- The king out front to usher home any passed pawns if possible and to keep Black from gaining any kind of control.
356,9,62,4g3,b'8/8/pp3kp1/7p/1P3K2/3b1NPP/P7/8 b - -',g3- W/ Blacks only bishop on light squares I needed to get the final 3 pawns onto dark ones.
357,9,63,4Bf1,b'8/8/pp3kp1/7p/1P3K2/5NPP/P7/5b2 w - -',Bf1 - To little to late. 
358,9,64,4Ne1,b'8/8/pp3kp1/7p/1P3K1P/6P1/P5b1/4N3 b - -',I can't trade my last knight at this point. First that would allow the Black king to move further into my territory and would severely hurt my chances of passing a pawn on either side. I must evade but I'll pressure at the same time.
359,9,65,4Bd5,b'8/8/pp3kp1/3b3p/1P3K1P/6P1/P7/4N3 w - -',Again to little to late.
360,9,66,4a3,b'8/8/pp3kp1/3b3p/1P3K1P/P5P1/8/4N3 b - -',Black now has very little he can do that doesn't allow me to have some kind of a foot hold. Everyone of my pieces are on dark squares and out of harms way.
361,9,67,4Be6,b'8/8/pp2bkp1/7p/1P3K1P/P5P1/8/4N3 w - -',Black attacks squares that I couldn't move into if I wanted to.
362,9,68,4Nf3,b'8/8/pp2bkp1/7p/1P3K1P/P4NP1/8/8 b - -',I again apply pressure onto g5 and e5. looking to advance there next turn.
363,9,69,4Ng5,b'8/8/pp3kp1/6Np/1P3KbP/P5P1/8/8 b - -',Again keeping Blacks white Bishop from being a factor and hemming in the black king.
364,9,70,4Bf5,b'8/8/pp3kp1/5bNp/1P3K1P/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Just some delaying moves by black. Hoping I make a mistake.
365,9,71,4Nd4,b'8/8/p4kp1/1p3b1p/1P1N1K1P/P5P1/8/8 b - -',Nd4 - I need to make my way over to the other side. This way I split the attention black can give to either side.
366,9,72,4Bg4,b'8/8/p4kp1/1p5p/1P1N1KbP/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Black seems lost and unsure of what to do. Bd7 would have stalemated my Night from advancing up the board.
367,9,73,Ke6,b'8/8/p1N1k1p1/1p5p/1P3KbP/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Ke6 - Now Black sees the delima and is attempting to thwart it.
368,9,74,5Nxa6,b'8/8/N2k2p1/1p5p/1P3KbP/P5P1/8/8 b - -',Nb8 Nxa6 - A simple smash and grab. And With my pawn on B5 I even have my get away car available.
369,9,75,5Kc6,b'8/8/N1k3p1/1p5p/1P3KbP/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Kc6- Black has totally focused on the knight and is given up on preventing the White King from blocking his him from returning.
370,9,76,5Kg5,b'8/8/N1k3p1/1p4Kp/1P4bP/P5P1/8/8 b - -',So I cozy on up to his nice little pawns.
371,9,77,5Nc5,b'8/8/2k3p1/1pN2bKp/1P5P/P5P1/8/8 b - -',Nc5- Jump in the get away car and make my escape.
372,9,78,5Kd5,b'8/8/6p1/1pNk1bKp/1P5P/P5P1/8/8 w - -',Kd5- Black sets his eyes on evening the score.
373,9,79,5Nb3,b'8/8/6p1/1p1k1bKp/1P5P/PN4P1/8/8 b - -',Nb3- A better move might have been Kf4 to prevent Ke3.
374,9,80,5Nc5+,b'8/8/6p1/1pN2bKp/1P2k2P/P5P1/8/8 b - -',But I settle on pushing him towards the hanging pawn on g3 knowing that he won't get the h4 pawn.
375,9,81,5a4,b'8/8/6p1/1pN2bKp/PP5P/5kP1/8/8 b - -',a4 prevents a problem for Black. If he takes he loses the pawn and allows a passed pawn that he will have sacrifice his bishop for to stop. If he doesn't then it passes anyway and Black is down a pawn.
376,9,82,5Nxa4,b'8/8/6p1/5bKp/NP5P/5kP1/8/8 b - -',nice trade and Black is sliding down the slippery slope as we speak.
377,9,83,5Kxg3,b'8/8/6p1/5bKp/NP5P/6k1/8/8 w - -',Black takes the consolation prize... Probably feeling a less confident at this point. The game is over at this point. Just advance the pawn up the board until Black is forced trade bishop for pawn...
378,9,84,6b7,b'8/1P6/6K1/2N4p/7P/5b2/5k2/8 b - -',Now Black is feeling the pressure. If the Bishop leaves his post to track down the wayward pawn Black losses his last two remaining pieces. 
379,9,85,6Bxb7,b'8/1b6/6K1/2N4p/7P/8/5k2/8 w - -',He makes the sacrifice.
380,9,86,Kg3,b'8/1N6/6K1/7p/7P/6k1/8/8 w - -',Kg3 - A better move at this point would be to forfeit. 
381,9,87,6Kg6,b'8/1N6/6K1/8/5k1P/8/8/8 b - -',Kg6- Just keep the king in front of the pawn and he is home free.
382,9,88,6Kg4,b'8/1N6/6K1/8/6kP/8/8/8 w - -',Black sees a free pawn and rushes in to snatch him up.
383,9,89,6h5,b'8/1N6/6K1/7P/6k1/8/8/8 b - -',"Black finally relizes his doom and gives up the ghost!

Like I said earlier I should have lost this game and probably would have had Blacked valued his pawns and bishops a little more. Good Game Black."

663,20,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"Although my favorite is the Siclian I actually wanted to learn the Caro Kann defense as I had to cope with it on two separate occasions.  One of them was against master elyhim.  However Jack Stockel told me that it is no longer played by Masters or Grandmasters in OTB chess.  He said that the Siclian is most common nowadays in OTB chess.  I told him that believe it or not the most common is also my favorite defense and he said ""good""."
664,20,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So he decides to go into the Open variation.

666,20,4,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Believe it or not this is still the most common move with the Sicilian.  When Jack was still teaching me the Sicilian he said that ...a6 is the proper continuation.  The only thing is that I often see 4...Ne6 followed by 5...a6.  In fact before this game the same opponent actually played 4...Ne6.  I actually like ...a6 as it prevents nonsense on b5 like Bb5+ or Nb5 though.  It's hard to say what should come first as they are both good early in the game.
667,20,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Although I did not play ...Nf6 right away I am not surprised that he played this.  Sooner or later that pawn needs protection as I am eventually going to play that move.  In addition this move also develops another piece.  
668,20,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',With that in mind I also decide to develop.  In addition I want to force a Knight exchange and I will be successful in doing so.  I don't like his Knight there because I have always felt that it could eventually do a lot of damage as that is his good Knight.
669,20,7,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/8/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',! In the meantime he is getting ready to castle.  In my opinion this is the best spot for his bishop.  If anywhere else I just attack it with my d6 pawn so that hinders his development while I develop even quicker.
670,20,8,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1pp4/4p3/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',Therefore I do not waste time.  In this position I just want to develop my Knight on the right wing so that I can castle Kingside.  However I do not want put in a place where it will be attacked so I decide to block his e4 pawn.  I know that this seems pessimistic but in the past I have had problems by letting e4 reach a stage where my Knight gets kicked around after it reaches f6. 
671,20,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',So I can now bring out my Knight without having to protect or worry about it.
672,20,10,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pp1n2/4p1B1/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Of course he finds a way to attack with a pin but that does not bother me.  Because I can easily defend that by breaking the pin.  And doing this also establishes even more development and will enable me to castle at last.
673,20,11,1Ne2,b'r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4p1B1/4P3/3B4/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',?! I figure that he made this move to distract me.  Because he knows me pretty well and getting distracted has prevented me from castling in the past.  But not this time however so I believe this move is a waste of time.  Now I am not completely sure and I normally would not guess as to why an opponent would make a move.  However myevilluck told me that there is always a reason for your opponents move even if it is bad in our first mentoring game.  He said that you should always try to guess the logic behind a move made by your opponent.

675,20,13,1c3,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4p1B1/4P3/2PB4/PP2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now his goal is to get his Queen out.  Of course since he is almost completely developed I do not mind because it is not threatening to cause any damage.  Now I was originally thinking of just attacking b2 with ...Qb6 but I am not going to do that.  Why?  That would just be a cheapo tactic to win the b2 pawn and I already know that he will not allow such thing especially because he is a very strong player.  Therefore I am going to continue properly by developing another piece.
676,20,14,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1ppbn2/4p1B1/4P3/2PB4/PP2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',It might seem weird but this is why I played this move.  First 11...Bd7 would block my own bishop and a pin from 11...Bg4 would just enable him to attack my LSB with 12.f3.  Most importantly however is the fact that I wanted to have two vertical bishops like this.  In a coaching or mentoring game I saw Expert adivela do this to a class a player known as steppenwolf.  Of course l-d-j told me that does not retroactively=a strong bishop pair.  So I spoke to Jack about this move and he said it was fine and that there was nothing wrong with it.  Therefore based upon that this does qualify as a strong bishop pair.
677,20,15,1Qa4,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1ppbn2/4p1B1/Q3P3/2PB4/PP2NPPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Now he decides to attack c6.  Well I am not going to blunder away material if I can avoid it.  As Jack Stockel has repeatedly said ""Don't give thing's away.""  So I have several options.  First is 12...Bd7 but I don't want to play that because I feel that it will disturb my bishop pair.  My second option is 12...Rc8? but then 13.Qxa6 which just loses pawn.  Therefore my decision is made to play 12...c5."

However that move is not going to stop me from attacking b2.  BTW my goal is more then just what I mentioned about b2.  So what am I really trying to do in this position?  Well I just want to get my Queen my out because it is the only piece that is not developed.  Although the center is controlled once I release my Queen development is complete.  So in the main sense I am actually going to accomplish my goal.
679,20,17,1Qc2,b'r4rk1/4bppp/pq1pbn2/2p1p1B1/4P3/2PB2N1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I know that this move defends b2 of course but I am shocked that he did not do this with 14.Rb2.  Normally pawns like these are defended by one of the rooks in positions like this.
680,20,18,1c4,b'r4rk1/4bppp/pq1pbn2/4p1B1/2p1P3/2PB2N1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"In the meantime I decide to attack d3 instead.  I always like it when my opponents have to run back and forth in order to defend pieces because I usually arrive at a position like this and start to get nervous.  Even if it's aimless kicking pieces around usually keeps my optimism high and inhibits the ""Fight or Flight"" response when I start to get anxious and occasionally begin hyperventilating in a chess game.  Therefore this is a very good reason for making a move and these type of moves show that I am thinking a little."
681,20,19,d5,b'r4rk1/4bppp/pq2bn2/3pp1B1/2p1P3/2P3N1/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I take advantage with this move as it leads to an exchange.  I think that I know one of his weaknesses but this is not one of them.  However an exchange is certainly not harmful in this position because I am not behind in material.  Remember when I said that I made certain moves that might seem ludicrous in order to avoid getting nervous?  Well I now feel very confident about my position and I believe that things are starting to get interesting here.  Of course I am not going to underestimate him.
682,20,20,1Rfd1,b'r4rk1/4bppp/pq3n2/3bp1B1/2p5/2P3N1/PPQ1BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',"Now his goal is to put pressure on the d file but I will have none have that.  So I am am going to make the same move or as it is said ""Two can play that game"".  Then we are going to exchange pieces."
683,20,21,Bxf6,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/pq3b2/3bp3/2p5/2P3N1/PPQ1BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',I also could have taken with my g7 pawn but 18...gxf6?? would have opened my King too much at this point in the game.  Afterall this is not an endgame.
684,20,22,1Qe4,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/pq3b2/3bp3/2p1Q3/2P3N1/PP2BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',"Ok.  This more then just a mistake.  Jack Stockel would not just make a careless or reckless move so what's going on here?  Well remember when I said that Jack rarely blunders unless he is trying to test you?  Well I learned that he tests people more often then I thought earlier today.  In fact he does this quite frequently.   This is the thing about Mr. Stockel he is super patient and will point out what you could have done better if you did not find the right move.  It also explains why this concept is basically the equivalent to Master elyhim's ""Money in the Bank"" as I had noted in a previous WTW coaching game against this same opponent.  This time however I am going to fail the test miserable and that is what will essentially end the game as we will see shortly.  So why is he trying to test people with these intentional mistakes?  As it turns out if you are in a losing position there is still a chance that your opponent will get reckless and make careless mistakes.  Therefore instead of resigning you take time and see how you can take advantage of these mistakes.  In some cases you could turn a loss into a win if you are successful so the idea is also that you will solve a problem quicker by sticking with it instead of running away from the obstacle.  When you try to run from a difficult situation the problem just comes back.  With that in mind Jack is not worried about winning or losing and he is not always trying to avoid careless mistakes himself.  Instead he is trying to teach you so that you can learn from your own mistakes just like any other coach or mentor.  However his style of doing that is great for my style of learning.  Consequently he is an excellent coach by my standards.    "
685,20,23,1Bc6,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/pqb2b2/4p3/2p1Q3/2P3N1/PP2BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',"?? As I mentioned earlier was not paying attention.  Why?  Well I was busy taking notes for this annotation instead as today is the first day where I bring in paper and a pencil and/or pen with me to write what was played.  BTW that is the notation that my friend id=l-d-j recommended when playing OTB chess games and that is not all that happened on this particular day.  Although it was not blitz or a timed game however there was also a time crunch because I only had about 25-30 minutes before the club had to end.  That is when the game started and I am now only down to about 10 minutes at this point.  Note: the club runs from 10:00 am-12:00 pm but it was already 11:35 am when the game started; and 11:50 am when we arrived at this position.  And if that's not enough I really wanted to see a game that Mr. Stockel had to show.  In fact the games that he has previously shown is why I went from just being a chess player and commenting in threads to being an annotator and a commentator.  In this context showing people a game is the equivalent to annotating a game and I have and do comment on the positions that this opponent shows.  Although he does not write them Jack actually explains what went wrong and walks through the process of how we can improve.  BTW that is also the main reason that I joined the ""Walking the Walk Club"" by easy19 followed by ""Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run Club"" by jstevens1 because it basically does the same thing and therefore matches my style of learning.  This also explains why I honor and recognize him as another helpful coach in the club by Joann.  What he shows is so inspiring but had this game lasted more then 5 minutes it would not have been feasible for him to do that.  In that I did not take enough time to spot this feasibility.  Although not immediate this move will eventually lose and is therefore a losing blunder."
686,20,24,2Rxd8+,b'r2R2k1/5ppp/pqb2b2/4p3/2p1Q3/2P3N1/PP2BPPP/R5K1 b - -',Of course my opportunity is gone so he decides to force an exchange.  Note: I am in check which is why it is not feasible to take his Queen in this position.
687,20,25,2Qg4,b'3r2k1/5ppp/pqb2b2/4p3/2p3Q1/2P3N1/PP2BPPP/R5K1 b - -',After that he will not give me anymore chances to take his Queen.
688,20,26,2Rd7,b'6k1/3r1ppp/pqb2b2/4p3/2p3Q1/2P3N1/PP2BPPP/R5K1 w - -',So I move here with the idea that if 22.Qxd7 22...Bxd7.  Of course I start to resort to unsound aggression because I missed an opportunity that I want back. But that is never going to happen.  Instead we are going to exchange pawns with 22.Bxc4 Qxb2.  I also get a little reckless due to our time crunch.
689,20,27,2Nh5,b'6k1/3r1ppp/p1b2b2/4p2N/2B3Q1/2P5/Pq3PPP/R5K1 b - -',In this case a Knight on the rim is dim.  He is threatening to do the unthinkable in this position.  That's right he is actually threatening mate or he wins bishop if I prevent that with my pawn.  Of course I can play 23...Qxa1+ but then 24.Bf1 and the threat of mate or serious loss of material is shortly back.  Instead I have to think about how to handle the threat.  So I spoke to my opponent and told him that I do not have many options other then 23...Kf8 and he agreed with my assessment.  In fact he said that this is about my only move here.  After that he will force an exchange in the worst way.  This time I will have no choice but to open up my King with 24...gxf6 after 24.Nxf6.  So this move is actually going to expose my King as the eighth rank will be under attack.  Therefore the game is going to end very quickly as it is a lost position with no way around it from here on in.  Note: Right now none of us are being optimistic but it is only due to the fact that we have to finish our game ASAP so that he can show us a game as I mentioned on move 19.
690,20,28,2Qh5,b'5k2/3r1p1p/p1b2p2/4p2Q/2B5/2P5/Pq3PPP/R5K1 b - -',"Although the game continued for a little longer it does not last more then 5 moves from now.  In fact I think that it ends in 2-3 moves at this point.  With that in mind I resign very shortly after this.  So why didn't I annotate anymore?  Because unlike before this time the positions are identical to the actual game except for this move.  After that however I completely lost track of what was played because he started showing me what went wrong as I was getting ready to resign.  BTW that does not usually happen but this is an extenuating circumstance.  Around this point things have to end or there will be no time to see the game that Jack wants to show and I would certainly do anything to see it even if I had to end things early.  But how was this game lost?  Well he plays something like Qxh7 winning a free pawn and that is the very least of my problems.  After that his Queen does reach the 8th rank resulting in a very serious check but I am not exactly sure exactly how it happened.  And it's not quite the same as this position which is why I did not continue the annotation.  What I do know however is that after the check I would have been forced to give up my Rook in order to avoid mate.  After that he told me that I would be too far behind in material to have any hope of catching up so the game is dead lost at this point even with best play.  Now he taught me something very interesting after showing the game and this happened while we were packing up and saying goodbye for this week.  What he told me is the moral of this game and pretty similar to the game he showed about the importance of paying attention.  Therefore what is the lesson?  Well in chess you always have to pay attention and concentrate not just on the position but your opponents mistake as well which is why he tests people.  If I had focused a little more I would have seen his mistake and won the Queen so like my game against bigpeta I had a win that I threw away.  However there is more then meets the eye.  Paying attention to and understanding the positions take time.  As he said ""It doesn't happen in just one second"".  So the idea is to take your time and concentrate on your opponents mistakes.  If you take enough time to absorb the information you will be able to take advantage of your opponents blunders and ultimately pull a win even in a losing position.

It's ding-a-ling time for Round 2 in my Welcome MT Part 1 against Terence (Elyhim).  Terence k'oed me in less than 20 moves aaargh and double aaargh!  So how did this happen?  Well here is a clue?  Old Matey just lurves those back ranks and corridors and to the detriment of Henry he found a nice little corridor here!  Now I started off with 1. e4 and Terence responds with g6 which is the Robatsch Defense.  Just like the Pirc and the Sicilian Dragon that black dark square bishop can prove an almighty handful."

But now I know that after Ne5 f6 then I cannot go Qh5 (because I didn't play d3 yet) so I must retire in d3 and after BxB NxB my knight is displaced and black will have an edge. By experience.

I won't take the pawn because after the N retakes is in a very good position. Then black will be able to play c4 preventing the bishop on f1 from the diagonal aiming at the black king. So I SHOULD have moved Bd3 even if black would have gone cxd4. (So what? I would have retaken with d3xd4 and my queen would have been almost free so...) But if the bishop is in d3 after c4 it goes to c2 and from there he aims at the enemy's king helping the queen to attack. So why to waste time with this useless c3?

Black should play then the 1 rook to e and threat mate with Re4. I couldn't have used the c pawn to shield because of N takes it but I could have used the c rook to go to d4. After the exchange the black knight could mate but taking some moves to get to c3 and I would have had time to react. I don't know if black had seen that far (nor if my view is accurate!) but he choosed another path. the wrong one as you'll see. 
943,30,63,4Nxg4,b'2R5/1p4R1/p7/1r5P/K5n1/2P3k1/P7/1r6 w - -',Fatal but is hard to see it. I can go Rc-g8 winning the knight as I commented before. But even better it is...

948,30,68,4h8=Q,b'2R4Q/1p4R1/p7/7r/K5nk/2P5/P7/1r6 b - -',...because now black cannot play RxQ for RxQ (Nh6 QxN#)!

Black loses the knight but hey he has a b4 pawn that can take c3 and threaten to queen. My rook check I will have anyway. Kxa6 is just a tempo loss: a6 is mine almost whatever happens (Kxa6 Ra1 and I lose the a pawn and b4 has a free way to b3).
953,30,73,4cxb4,b'2R5/6R1/p7/K6k/1P4n1/8/P7/1r6 b - -',So this was the profilactic move. Now black has to cope with an ugly position and it is just question of time to lose. Note we are at move 48 and not less than 20 more are needed to win. But it was an enjoyable game full with surprises mistakes and tactics. It is interesting to observe that the black knight is just lost because of the black king's position. He should have played the rook to the e file to get it to the 6th row as the only mean to defend. 
954,30,74,4Ne5,b'2R5/6R1/p7/K3n2k/1P6/8/P7/1r6 w - -',Unfortunately black leaves control of h6 and loses at once. 
955,30,75,4Rh8#,b'7R/6R1/p7/K3n2k/1P6/8/P7/1r6 b - -',A lot of tension and probably frustration by black that loses after have being well ahead. It is always a good excercise to try to get the most from your pieces even if you are down. In this case it was indeed possible.

1092,35,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"This is a common way to arrive at the modern Benoni. Essentially Black puts off committing to the line until White has played a couple more moves in order to avoid some nasty ""anti-Benoni"" lines. This is in contrast to the Old Benoni which is the immediate 1.d4 c5."
1093,35,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Obviously this opening can still unfold many different ways: we're still in a generic Indian opening right now. Black is still keeping options on the table.
1094,35,2,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is the key move of the Benoni. 
1095,35,3,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And this is the basic setup; clearly it can be reached through any number of transpositions but the key pawn structure has now been set up. From here play may continue in a number of ways but the semi-open center and lack of Black d-pawn can make for a very fluid struggle for dominance. I like this opening already.
1096,35,4,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is standard. White supports his d-pawn and strengthens his claim to the center. Furthermore many lines in this opening seem to revolve around an e4-e5 break by White.
1097,35,5,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',As the Black DSB is blocked in by the d6 pawn fianchettoing it seems to be called for. This is another place this opening is similar to an Indian defense but unlike in (e.g.) the King's Indian the fiachettoed Bishop will not be blocked by a Black pawn on e5.

1099,35,7,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The Taimanov Variation. White develops with check and announces his intentions to really constrict Black's game. The upshot is that Black's best response is 8...Nfd7 cramping his LSB and Queen's Knight. If he tries 8...Nbd7 the game is still playable but Black will have to give up material of some kind after 9.e5.

At the time I thought it would have few prospects there gazing at the sturdy Black kingside pawns but I failed to anticipate how much pressure Black would soon be putting on my e-pawn.
1103,35,11,1Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/1p1nqpbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P2B1PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',A couple of database games have the line 10...Qh4+ 11.g3 Qe7 instead which busts up the White kingside a little more. According to my opponent he did consider that line but decided weakening my kingside wasn't worth the strength that the g3 pawn could lend to my center.
1104,35,12,1Qc2,b'rnb1k2r/1p1nqpbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1PQ1B1PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',White defends the e-pawn as Black was threatening to win it with 11...Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qxe4.

As White it was about here that I found myself wishing that I had played Bd3 instead of Be2 because then I'd have a move free to play Re1 and hold the center calmly. But I didn't so now I was stuck debating between trying to hold e4 or trying to push e5.
1109,35,17,1Bd3,b'rnb1r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2NB1N2/1PQ3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I settled for holding e4. 14.Ng5? doesn't accomplish anything after 14...h6 15.Nf3 Nxe4 16.Nxe4 Qxe4 so I went with the Bishop move expecting Black's response to be the very-sharp 14...c4!? 15.Bxc4 Nxe4. Now if 16.Nxe4?! Qxe4 17.Qxe4 Rxe4 18.Bd3 Rb4 Black looks pretty strong so instead White needs to play 16.Re1! and the situation gets even more complex. A sample line might continue 16...f5 17.Bd3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qc7!? 19.Bxe4 fxe4 20.Rxe4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 Qxc3 and now White can force a draw if he wants or else the shootout begins in earnest!

I was trying to prepare for either b2-b4 or just the eventualities arising from the Black DSB on the long diagonal but I think this move is too passive. I think I could have gotten away with 15.e5! (...dxe5 16.Nxe5). I think 15.Bd2 or 15.Re1 were also good options. The GK computer doesn't consider this move an error but it does quietly drop my perceived advantage by about half a point.
1112,35,20,1Rxf3,b'rn2r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2NB1R2/1PQ3PP/1RB3K1 b - -',16.gxf3 might actually be better as counterintuitive as that is. It would lend more support to the center and keep Black out of g4.
1113,35,21,1Ng4,b'rn2r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PPn1/2NB1R2/1PQ3PP/1RB3K1 w - -',Strong. The pressure on e4 has let up a bit but now there are warning signs to take note of: the Queen has access to my kingside now and the now-undefended d4 square looks tempting to the newly-freed Black Bishop.
1114,35,22,1h3,b'rn2r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PPn1/2NB1R1P/1PQ3P1/1RB3K1 b - -',This basically guarantees a draw (if Black wants it). 17.Ne2 would have kept it interesting.

The obvious threats are ...Qe1+ and ...Nf2+. The only way to mount a legitimate resistance to the latter is with 19.Nd1 which while it makes for a *very* interesting position does not look good for White in the long run. 19.Rf1?? seems to lose outright to ...Qg3 followed by ...Qh2# so I chose the path I could see clearly.

This HW is for my Mentor Drhpatron who I have had some fairly good games with even though I lost the lot.  This game starts off OK and then goes south for me after an injudicious knight trade and that familiar dread disease passivitis sets in.  David then injects a paralysis into my position so that I finally run out of moves that avoid further damage to my position.

1199,39,4,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/2p5/3pPP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',6. ..... bxc6 - I can't resist it can I Ion I give up Fou Leblanc for a knight to split up my opponent's pawns and it will not be to my benefit.
1200,39,5,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/2p5/4PP2/3p1N2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',7. ..... d3 - a crimp of which I try and break free from.
1201,39,6,Qxd3,b'r1b1kbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/2p5/4PP2/3q1N2/PP1PN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',8. ..... Qxd3 - the Wicked Witch of the West replaces that pawn on d3.  Ssss and double ssss!
1202,39,7,1e5,b'r1b1k1nr/p4ppp/2pbp3/2p1P3/5P2/2Nq1N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',10. e5 - attempting to shut out David's dark square bishop.
1203,39,8,1Nxe2,b'r1b1k1nr/p1b2ppp/2p1p3/2p1P3/5P2/5N2/PP1PN1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',12. Nxe2 - at least the queens are off the board and I remember telling David that I thought that Henry could sleep a little more peacefully in his 4 poster bed!  How wrong I was to be!
1204,39,9,1d3,b'r1b1k2r/p1b1nppp/2p1p3/2p1P3/5P2/3P1N2/PP2N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',13. d3?! - maybe d4 was better at this point.  Incredibly I never get to develop Fou Lenoir and this ties up the whole of my queenside.
1205,39,10,1Rd1,b'r3k2r/p1b2ppp/b1p1p3/2pnP3/5P2/3P1N2/PP2N1PP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',15. Rd1 - I defend the pawn on d3 for now but it is gonna be a target.  I am now rueing not offering it up for David's c pawn to exchange it on d4.
1206,39,11,Rb3,b'4k2r/p1b2ppp/b1p1p3/2pnP3/5P2/PrNP1N2/1P4PP/R1BR2K1 w k -',17. ..... Rb3 - another invasion and I never get to drive it off.  I try and break free by trading knights but this makes things soooo much worse.
1207,39,12,1d4,b'4k2r/p1b2ppp/b3p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/Pr3N2/1P4PP/R1BR2K1 b k -',19. d4 - at last but too late.

I get the feeling like I got when I lost to the Dentist many moons ago and Coach Ion and Dmaestro said that they both felt that I waited for the executioner.  My instinct was sadly right.  Like Henry the 8th in The Tudors David has already ordered that executioner from France by DHL!
1209,39,14,Rc2,b'8/p2k1ppp/4p3/b2pP3/3p1P2/Pr3PK1/RPr4P/2BR4 w - -',25. ..... Rc2 - cutting off Henry's retreat to the 2nd rank.  Yup I really am feeling like Anne Boleyn right now!

Et Fou Lenoir sur c1 est tres tres fou!  Ah well that is the end of my A' Level French!  Time to say well played to David Patron!  Kind regards to you all - Joanne.
