Supporting a f-pawn push eventually and allowing me to castle long. Other moves don't accomplish this accurately. I could technically probably move 8. Be2 and castle kingside but it isn't in the spirit and I don't like creating new plans. Moving the LSB anywhere else would be an inaccuracy because of him having moves like 8. ... Qc7 or Qb6.

Every pawn move of the kingsside (the side where you castled) is weakening but i prefer this move because White will play g5 later and i will exchange the pawns to get a more active defense over the line 6 and 7. Coincidentally the pieces of these lines should attack the opponents king side.

I can get my LSB on f3 instead to protect my e4 pawn rather than tie up my queen. I also like waving at his king on the g-file. (It stops b5 for now because he has to open his bishop on its line to protect f5 as a knight could get there as said earlier and with the Q on g3 that would be devastating.)

However even though the e4 and f4-pawn are cramping my style they are over extended especially e4! Another reason to attack e4 immediately is to break up white's centre before he has a chance to consolidate. Therefore I would choose 12. ...Nc5-> now white has two main replies:
                                                                                                                        Best line 13. Bf3 e5!(attacking the d4-knight and forcing white to give up the space advantage) 14. fxe5 dxe5(black's pawn structure is better and white has an isolani e-pawn) 15.

                                                                                                                        15. Bxf6!? give black the bishop pair but now white can use the d5 strong point for his knight.

That is a direct attack on the black king is it not? Does Black then have to play 14....Bxf5 ?. And White then would play 15.exf5 correct?. Now blacks d-pawn is still backward Whites LSB is released and aimed right at d5and d6 is under attack. By 14.fxe5 white un/cramps Blacks position for him.

My line was something like: 14. Nf5 Bxf4 15. exf5 Rfc8 16. Rhe1 e4 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. Bxe4 Rab8

Sometime I play the Caro-Kann but I'm not that much experimented with the advance variation that I see often these days.
204,7,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I'm going for a sicilian najdorf. a6 protect the square b5 and give the possibility to do b5 later giving the possibility to counter-attack with b4 or to do Bb7.
205,7,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq e6',The immediate e5 give the possibility to develop the bishop for castling and reduce the threat of the knight. White have to chose: Nf3 or Nb3. Ne2 is possible but white will need to move the knight again later to be able to develop the bishop. 
206,7,3,Nb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',For right now the knight look to be blocked by the pawns but he can be very useful later in the game.

208,7,5,Nxd5,b'rnbq1rk1/4bppp/p2p4/1p1np3/4P3/1N2BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',?! Well I have moved quickly I didn't like the threats of the knight (Bb6 Nxf6).

212,7,9,1Nc6,b'Q1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1np4/1p2p3/4P3/1N2BP2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',! Nc6 blocks the way for the queen to escape and the queen can't go to a7.

Nc1 would have given me the possibility to Nxc2 snatching a pawn for free and I think that 17.Nd2 Nxd3 18.cxd3 Qc2 I would have been able to gain the d pawn without problem.
217,7,14,Ba6,b'5k2/2q1bppp/b2p4/p3p3/4P3/PN1PBP2/1P4PP/R4RK1 w - -',Pinning the pawn. If Qc2 then Nxa5 and I don't think it advantage my position.

331,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual the King's Pawn Opening.
332,12,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And he responds conventionally with the King's Pawn Game.  BTW it is going to become a Ruy Lopez.
333,12,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So he decides to take attack my LSB after I take his Knight.  BTW one week later last Friday this opponent told me that 4.Bxc6 is best in this position.

I used to view this as serious and this is a point where I would often resign.  Why?  I lose my chance to castle as a result.  However he proved that it does not make this check serious and I could do something that is as good as castling.  What is it?  Well there is still a way to tuck the monarch away as we will see momentarily.
338,12,7,Qe2,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/4q3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',In the meantime this move is forced and he will take advantage by exchanging our Queens.  
339,12,8,Bc5,b'r1b1k1nr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/2b5/8/5N2/PPPPKPPP/RNB4R w kq -',As a result he decides to develop his DSB while my left wing is completely undeveloped.  But why not 8...Bd6? That would have done the same thing.  This move however will cause problems for his DSB later in the game.  However this is the first side where I would normally develop.  Therefore I just want to continue with my development immediately.  He said however that it is far more important to get the King to safety since it is exposed at the moment.  So how do you compensate for losing your right to castle?  He told me that the first thing you want to do is move the Rook directly behind or one file left of the King and that is what I am going to do.
340,12,9,Ne7,b'r1b1k2r/1pp1nppp/p1p5/2b5/8/5N2/PPPPKPPP/RNB1R3 w kq -',In the meantime he continues with development by bringing out his Knight.  Right now he does not have a choice even though you generally don't want to deploy your Knight on the seventh rank if you're black or on the second rank if you are white.  However if his Knight went to the third rank what would happen?  Well it would result in a very serious check where he would have to pull his Knight back to this spot or play 10...Be7 which would ultimately lose a piece if he were to castle.  After this move he told me that my King should go to f1.  That way it is as effective as castling.  
341,12,10,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1nppp/p1p5/2b5/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1RK2 w - -',After I do that he castles.
342,12,11,1d4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1nppp/p1p5/2b5/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1RK2 b - d3',This is why I was wondering why 8...Bc5 as opposed to 8...Bd6.  In this position I feel that he is trying to stop me from continuing with development so I decide to kick his DSB.  If this was not played I do not think that I would be able to develop my bishop without fianchettoing it.  However chess mentor myevilluck told me that it is generally a bad idea to fianchetto your bishop. 
343,12,12,1Bd6,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1nppp/p1pb4/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1RK2 w - -',I'm sure that he wanted to play 11...Bb6 as opposed to this move in order to protect c7 in the long term.  On other hand that is not feasible in this position.  Why?  If 11...Bb6 12.Re7 which gives away a free steed.  I did a lot of editing in terms of setting up the positions and the original recording was that black played 11...Bb6.  And I developed before moving the King back followed by the Rook on e1 as mentioned earlier.  However like the Master Mater it is extremely unlikely that Jack will give away material unless it=a win or if he is testing you as we will see later on.  
344,12,13,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp1nppp/p1pb4/8/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN2RK2 b - -',So as I mentioned earlier I do not need to fianchetto my DSB in order to continue with development.
345,12,14,1Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n4/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN2RK2 w - -',Now he decides to make his Knight more active by taking it off the seventh rank.  If I were black however I would have brought out the LSB in order to complete development.  
346,12,15,1Nc3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n4/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3RK2 b - -',"In the meantime I decide to finish my own development by bringing the other Knight ""into play"" as my opponent calls it.  Therefore I believe that I have an edge as I am more developed.  However Jack has ways around the fact that he is not completely developed.  Sooner or later he will finish the last step of development. "
347,12,16,1Nb4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/8/1n1P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3RK2 w - -',This is one way that he gets around it.  Jack see's an opportunity to attack my c2 pawn.  However I miscalculate and make an inaccurate safety check because I think that he is actually attacking my b2 pawn.  In all of my past games on Gameknot b2 was under attack not c2.  Therefore I decide to protect b2 which will become my first mistake as it gives away a free pawn.
348,12,17,1Re2,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPn1RPPP/1R3K2 b - -',After he takes I decide to attack his Knight.  Therefore Mr. Stockel will be forced to retreat the Knight before he can complete development.  As noted earlier he frequently has a way around that. 
349,12,18,1a3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/8/1n1P4/P1N1BN2/1P2RPPP/1R3K2 b - -',After he pulls back I decide to reattack his Knight forcing him to make another retreat.
350,12,19,1Na4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n4/N2P4/P3BN2/1P2RPPP/1R3K2 b - -',"? After he pulls back I decide to place my Knight on the rim which is a mistake.  In most cases a Knight on the rim is grim and this is not an exception.  My goal however was to wear him down so that he would eventually give something away like one of his pawns on the a-c file.  However it is very unusual for players like Jack Stockel to blunder material as I mentioned earlier.  It's like your chance of getting four of a kind in a pocker game.  In addition myelivuk told me in a PM that you always need a good reason for making a move and that is why he did not want me to ""fianchetto the bishop"" until I learned more openings.  It is especially because my reasons behind a fianchetto are not good.  On the other hand the reason for this move was even worse then that of a fianchetto and I did not even know it until yesterday (when I started editing this game.)  If that's not bad enough this move is a big mistake and almost a blunder.  Why?  It is going to result in a serious pin on his next move.  As a result this is a bad move and for the wrong reason."
351,12,20,1Ree1,b'r4rk1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n4/N2P2b1/P3BN2/1P3PPP/1R2RK2 b - -',?? This move however is even worse.  In fact it is a blunder not just a mistake.  In this position I was determined to break the pin at once because I absolutely hate being pinned.  Although 18.h3 does not break the pin it was best in this position.  First he is going to force an exchange as a direct result.  That itself is bad enough because I do not like to exchange when I am behind.  Most importantly however is the fact that this move exposes my King.  After the exchange my King is almost hanging and there are a lot of weaknesses because I no longer have three surrounding pawns to keep the King protected.  Instead I only have a case a of doubled pawns so I now have to be very careful with the King.  Because of this blunder he now has a strong edge. 
352,12,21,Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n4/N2P4/P3BP2/1P3P1P/1R2RK2 w - -',In this position he wants to exchange our Rooks.  However I think that he is attacking my DSB but make a serious miscalculation.  Until now I completely forgot that this bishop is actually protected.  
353,12,22,2Bg5,b'r3r1k1/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/3n2B1/N2P4/P4P2/1P3P1P/1R2RK2 b - -',? So I allow the exchange.  I was worried that he would win a free bishop if I did not accept it.  Therefore he actually gets what he really wanted.  With that in mind this is another mistake as I am still lacking in material so this exchange benefits him.  In addition this move gives away another free pawn after the exchange.  
354,12,23,2Kg2,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/3n2B1/N2P4/P4P2/1P3PKb/4R3 b - -',? After he takes I decide to attack his DSB.  According to Jack Stockel however this is a mistake in itself.  Why?  When you have a position like this and your King is already exposed you don't want to bring him out as this exacerbates the exposure.
355,12,24,2Bxf4,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/3n4/N2P1B2/P4P2/1P3PK1/4R3 b - -',? Just when I thought that I was compensating for my mistakes this is another one.  This time however I mistakenly thought that his bishop was free.  Once again however is the fact that my coach does not give anything away that often.  Therefore I overlooked his Knight and did not realize that if I took his DSB he would retake my DSB with his Knight.  However I have not compensated for the loss of material at the moment.  Better was the immediate 23.Kf1 making up for the fact that I had exacerbated the exposure as I mentioned earlier.
356,12,25,2Kf1,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/N2P1n2/P4P2/1P3P2/4RK2 b - -',After he takes and places me in check I finally move my King back as Jack Stockel mentioned a few moves earlier. 
357,12,26,2Nd3,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/N2P4/P2n1P2/1P3P2/4RK2 w - -',So he decides to attack my Rook.
358,12,27,2Rd1,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/N2P4/P2n1P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 b - -',And I respond by attacking his Knight.
359,12,28,2Nf4,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/N2P1n2/P4P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 w - -',So he has no choice but to retreat.
360,12,29,2Nc5,b'r5k1/1pp2ppp/p1p5/2N5/3P1n2/P4P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 b - -',Therefore I take advantage of my opportunity to bring my Knight back to the proper square off the rim.
361,12,30,2b6,b'r5k1/2p2ppp/ppp5/2N5/3P1n2/P4P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 w - -',And he attacks my Knight but I do not pull it back to the rim.  Instead I bring it to e4 which keeps it protected and hopefully gives it back it's value.  The thing is that one reason it is usually a bad idea to place your Knight on the rim is that it makes it worth less.  Once it loses some of its value I do not know if it can be regained.
362,12,31,c5,b'r5k1/2p2ppp/pp6/2p5/3PNn2/P4P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 w - -',In this position Jack's goal is to get rid of his doubled pawns.  Why?  He considers doubled pawns weak so he gives away a pawn to straighten out his structure.  Last week his c pawns were also doubled.  Believe it or not that involved the same opening (the Ruy Lopez.)  In addition this move still leaves him a point ahead.  Therefore giving away a free pawn is not so bad in this context.
363,12,32,Re8,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/p7/2N5/5n2/P4P2/1P3P2/3R1K2 w - -',In this position his main goal is to put pressure on my Knight but I am not going to allow that as we will see shortly.
364,12,33,3b4,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/p7/2N5/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/3R1K2 b - b3',Although I could have I do not take his a6 pawn.  Why?  If I did that he would continue to attack my Knight until the remaining Rooks are off the board.  However that is something I do not want because I need at least one more powerful piece in order to stay in this game any longer.  One Knight as well as a few extra pawns is not going to cut the mustard as we will see later on.  Therefore I decide to connect my pawns.  Note: In a previous game Mr. Stockel told me and illustrated that two connected pawns are extremely dangerous and often win.
365,12,34,3Re6,b'6k1/2p2ppp/p3r3/2N5/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',"?? This is not just a serious mistake so what happened?  Jack Stockel deliberately made this flaw because he wanted to see if I was going to spot it so he was testing me.  In one respect it is similar to elyhim's style of ""Money in the Bank"" where he and his student start off with 5 dollars.  Now if elyhim's student makes a mistake he or she loses a dollar of what they started.  If however the student makes a good move he or she gets to keep a dollar.  Now if the student loses more then 2 or 3$ in the beginning then you know that he or she did not play well.  Well the same thing could be said here but in a very different sense.  That is because Mr. Stockel will unpurposely make a mistake in some games.  In most cases his students do not see this mistake.  When that happens Jack tells the student how he or she could have strengthened his or her position gotten an advantage or won material to help them improve their games.  However as we will see I exchange his Rook for my remaining Knight.  Therefore I spot the mistake and he told me that even some of his stronger students overlook this.  As a result Jack told me that he was and looked really impressed that I passed this test."
366,12,35,3Rd8+,b'3R2k1/2p3pp/p3p3/8/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 b - -',After that I decide to place him in check and this is serious.  Why?  He was threatening to promote one of his pawns but I did not want to allow that.  This should prevent a promotion but it's not as I am going to make a very serious blunder that will end this game in a little while.
367,12,36,3Kf7,b'3R4/2p2kpp/p3p3/8/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 w - -',Forced.
368,12,37,3Rh8,b'7R/2p2kpp/p3p3/8/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 b - -',In this position I am determined to win his h pawn.  Best however would have been Rc8 as it puts a lot of pressure on the c file.
369,12,38,3h6,b'7R/2p2kp1/p3p2p/8/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 w - -',Now he has a way to protect the pawn.  Of course I did not realize that and once again overestimate the value of this position.  That is going to seal my fate and eventually lead to my downfall.  
370,12,39,3Rh7,b'8/2p2kpR/p3p2p/8/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 b - -',"?? Jack Stockel accurately pointed out that this is the losing blunder.  When the game was over he asked me why 34.Rh7 after 31.Nxf6 fxe6 32.Rd8+.  I told him that I was trying to win his h pawn and I thought that he had no way of protecting it.  Afterall I have studied some end games with a youtube video.  But I have also analyzed endgames with the same opponent before this game. That is how people usually win material during the endgame specifically pawns.  In fact that is how I won most of my games on this site during the end.  However that is not the case here and his response was ""Start thinking"".  He told me that the Rook had to stay on the 8th rank where it remained very active.  This move however takes away it's activity so it goes from being active to inactive (or from mobile to dead.) "
371,12,40,3h5,b'8/2p2kpR/p3p3/7p/1P3n2/P4P2/5P2/5K2 w - -',This move might seem like a mistake.  However his pawn is still protected in this position due to his Knight.
372,12,41,3a4,b'8/2p2kpR/p3p3/7p/PP3n2/5P2/5P2/5K2 b - -',"At this point I am pretty sure that he will make a promotion but I don't resign immediately.  That is because in previous games Jack Stockel has said ""Don't give up right away."""
373,12,42,3c6,b'8/5kpR/p1p1p3/7p/PP3n2/5P2/5P2/5K2 w - -',In the meantime my opponent decides to advance his c pawn.  Why?  Because this is where he starts making plans for a promotion. 
374,12,43,3b5,b'8/5kpR/p1p1p3/1P5p/P4n2/5P2/5P2/5K2 b - -',Therefore with nothing else to lose I decide to fork his a and c pawns and force an exchange.  If I did not move here 36...a5 so he could still promote a pawn.  Therefore I would not stand a chance to make a promotion.  Why?  Because 37...Nd5 and if 38.a7 38...Nc7 stopping the promotion in it's path.  Yet he would still be able to play ...c5 followed by c4.  From there on it would just keep moving down the ranks until he promotes.  With this exchange everything is even material wise but the game is still lost.  It's a perfect example that being behind or ahead material wise does not retroactively determine a win or loss.  As cdeburca has repeatedly mentioned in some of my previous annotations being even does not=a draw.  Likewise lacking in material does not necessarily=a loss.  After he and I are done exchanging material I know that a promotion is inevitable so I resign.
375,12,44,cxb5,b'8/5kpR/4p3/1p5p/5n2/5P2/5P2/5K2 w - -',After this game Jack Stockel taught me an important lesson and his lesson is also the moral of this story.  If an endgame boils down to a Knight V. a Rook it is extremely important to keep your Rook active.  If you deactivate it your opponents Knight becomes extremely powerful and dangerous ultimately leading to a loss.

Creo que la tensión del juego le pegó demasiado ambos pusimos demasiada concentración y sólo bastó una jugada imprecisa para voltear la situación radicalmente.

Mientras los curiosos observaban al joven y murmuraban yo sólo guarde silencio y volteé mi mirada al juego. Sin embargo el joven había perdido por completo la concentración era cuestión de tiempo para que se equivocara. Entonces me dio la mano me firmó la hoja se levantó y se fue. Sentí deseos de darle una palmada en el hombro y decirle que admiraba su pasión por este juego. Pero cuando un hombre llora realmente no hay que hacer nada. Todos pasamos por eso y es parte de la madurez. Luego me lo volví a encontrar en la 6ta ronda y me felicitó por mi desempeño y yo también le deseé suerte.

495,17,4,1Be2,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3pn3/2P5/1PN1PN2/PB2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? My first concrete mistake. I need to be looking at cxd5 because right now Black can give me a weak isolated c-pawn with 11...Nxf3 12.Bxf3 dxc4 13.bxc4. It's not huge; I don't lose material but it's a weakness to be exploited as the game goes on and there's no reason to allow it.

White doesn't have to--indeed he shouldn't--respond to it at all! Check it out: 13.cxd5! Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 Bd6 (or else I trap and win the Bishop) 15.dxc6 bxc6 and White may have a slight advantage despite his King being open to the air. Of course I missed this at the time.
497,17,6,1g3,b'r1b1r1k1/ppq2ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/2P5/1PN1PBP1/PB3P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? See above; 13.cxd5 was better.
498,17,7,1bxc4,b'r3r1k1/ppq2ppp/2pb1n2/8/2P5/2N1PBPb/PB3P1P/R2QR1K1 b - -',Now I'm stuck with the weak c-pawn I should have been worried about.
499,17,8,Bc5,b'r3r1k1/1pq2ppp/2p2n2/p1b5/2P5/PQN1PBPb/1B3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Let's take stock of the position briefly. Material is equal and the center is contested. Black's Queen is tied to the defense of b7 while White's Queen has only limited mobility. Black's King is a bit safer and his overall pawn structure is more stable. Black has more active pieces at a glance but they don't actually have many immediate prospects. White has the move. Long story short the position is very nearly equal probably with a slight advantage to Black.
500,17,9,1Ne4,b'r2r2k1/1pq2ppp/2p2n2/p1b5/2P1N3/PQ2PBPb/1B3P1P/3RR1K1 b - -',The computer considers this inaccurate and I'm inclined to agree. The intent is to kick the Black DSB and free the White one but mostly what this accomplishes is letting Black trade off his somewhat weak Knight. If I had it to do again I'd play 19.Na4 here.
501,17,10,Be6,b'r2r2k1/1pq2ppp/2p1b3/p1b5/2P1B3/PQ2P1P1/1B3P1P/3RR1K1 w - -',Pinning the weak pawn to the WQ and she to its defense. How undignified.
502,17,11,2f4,b'r2r2k1/1pq2ppp/2p1b3/p1b5/2P1BP2/PQ2P1P1/1B5P/3RR1K1 b - f3',I was struggling at the time to get my pieces working together. This move was intended to allow my King to move up to f2 and generally free up my kingside but mostly it just gives Black a bunch of weak light squares to jump around on. The other move I was considering at the time was 21.Bd4 and I think now that that was the right choice. If I could convince Black to exchange there it would largely remove the weakness of my c-pawn (by placing a pawn on the d-file next to it).
503,17,12,2Bg4,b'r2r2k1/1pq2ppp/2p5/p1b5/2P1BPb1/PQ2P1P1/1B5P/3RR1K1 w - -',Only logical now that I can't block it with the pawn anymore.
504,17,13,2Rd3,b'r2r2k1/1pq2ppp/2p5/p1b5/2P1BPb1/PQ1RP1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 b - -',Perhaps 22.Rxd8 Qxd8 23.Qc2 would have been better to forestall Black's next move which severely cramps White's game.
505,17,14,2f5,b'r2r2k1/1pq3pp/2p5/p1b2p2/2P1BPb1/PQ1RP1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 w - f6',This is very strong. Thanks in part to the Rook White's Bishop has a really not-so-good outlook.
506,17,15,2Qc3,b'3r2k1/1pq3pp/2p5/p1b2p2/2P2Pb1/P1Q1P1P1/1B4BP/4R1K1 b - -',Time to evaluate the board again. Material is still even; the center still contested. White has noticeable pawn weaknesses; Black not so much. Both sides have a good Bishop and a bad one but Black's are more effective overall and Black's Rook is far superior. White's King is a bit safer than Black's thanks in large part to the threat of Qxg7# currently being defended by the BQ. Everything is developed but Black has better overall activity and a little more space. I'd definitely give Black a small advantage here but it's still anybody's game.
507,17,16,2b6,b'3r2k1/2q3pp/1pp5/p1b2p2/2P2Pb1/P1Q1P1P1/1B4BP/4R1K1 w - -',? Scroll back up a second to the previous move. Black had a definite if small advantage. This one pawn move turns it all around. Thanks to the one single threat on the board for White there is now a move that tips the scales back the other way.
508,17,17,2Bxc6,b'3r2k1/2q3pp/1pB5/p1b2p2/2P2Pb1/P1Q1P1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 b - -',! White snaps up the c6 pawn winning the material but more importantly gaining space in the center and activating his good Bishop because now d5 is available. Of course Black must not play 26...Qxc6?? because of 27.Qxg7#
509,17,18,2Bxa3,b'3r2k1/2q3pp/1pB5/p4p2/2P2Pb1/b1Q1P1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 w - -',?! This is a tricky play to try to regain material equality. Of course if White captures on a3 he no longer has a mating threat and the BQ is free to recoup the Bc6 with the advantage. But White has no need to take the Bishop right away--he has a zwischenzug available!
510,17,19,2Bd5+,b'3r2k1/2q3pp/1p6/p2B1p2/2P2Pb1/b1Q1P1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 b - -',The Bishop no longer en prise White will be free to capture on a3 after the BK moves and he'll be up a full piece.
511,17,20,2Rxd5,b'6k1/2q3pp/1p6/p2r1p2/2P2Pb1/b1Q1P1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 w - -',! The best move. Black can reduce and attempt to draw by the power of his queenside pawns even behind a Rook to a Bishop.
512,17,21,Bc5,b'6k1/2q3pp/1p6/p1bP1p2/5Pb1/2Q1P1P1/1B5P/4R1K1 w - -',? I think 28...Qxc3 29.Bxc3 Bf3 was certainly better. Black is going to be hard-pressed to play for a win at this point and he'll have a much better time drawing with the Queens off the board.
513,17,22,Qe7,b'6k1/4q1pp/1p6/p1bP1p2/5Pb1/2Q1P1P1/1B5P/2R3K1 w - -',Getting out of the pin and threatening to win back the lost material with ...Bxe3+ and an easy draw with Bishops of opposite colors.
514,17,23,3Qe5,b'5k2/4q1pp/1p6/p1bPQp2/5Pb1/4P1P1/1B3K1P/2R5 b - -',White finally offers the Queen trade--but on extremely favorable terms. There is little Black can do at this point but accept.
515,17,24,Ke7,b'8/4k1pp/1p6/p1bPPp2/6b1/4P1P1/1B3K1P/2R5 w - -',With connected passed pawns and a Rook to Black's Bishop (nearly a whole Rook anyway considering how useless Black's LSB is now that there's nothing for it to support) White's victory from here is straightforward.
516,17,25,3e6,b'5k2/2R3pp/1p2P3/p2P1p2/3B2b1/b3P1P1/5K1P/8 b - -',The net is closing.
517,17,26,Ke8,b'4k3/2R3Bp/1p1bP3/p2P1p2/6b1/4P1P1/5K1P/8 w - -',or 36...Kg8 37.Rd7. The text sets up a prettier combination for the finish.
518,17,27,3Bf8+,b'2R2B2/4k2p/1p1bP3/p2P1p2/6b1/4P1P1/5K1P/8 b - -',Winning the Bishop and with it any hopes Black might have been harboring of saving the game.
519,17,28,3Bxd6,b'2R5/7p/1p1BPk2/p2P1p2/6b1/4P1P1/5K1P/8 b - -',1-0. Faced with a ruinous material deficit and an imminent promotion Black resigns. There were really only a couple of very small errors--inaccuracies on both sides for sure. Any comments that you better players might have things I've missed--they'd all be much appreciated; I know I don't understand these positions as well as I might. Many thanks to toughplaya for a great match and thank you for reading!
520,18,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Hi all! Just a quick blitz from last month in an opening that doesn't get enough attention in my opinion. This is Larsen's Opening. Enjoy!
521,18,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',1...e5 is a more modern approach but this is the classical variation. This can become a sort of reversed Indian defense with Nf3.
522,18,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I think 2...Nf6 is probably better but this is fine. I just prefer to maintain the option of playing ...c5 at some point in the near future.
523,18,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',The points of contention are of course those that White's Bishop overlooks--d4 and e5.
524,18,4,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',...e7-e5 is too difficult to play for now so Black settles for a more passive pose and will attempt a break in the midgame.
525,18,5,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now that the White Bishop is no longer pinning the g7 pawn it's all right to close it off temporarily for the sake of development.
526,18,6,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',5...Bd6 was better. This Bishop threatens nothing from e7 nor are there any threats for it to defend against. If a piece placed in a certain spot will have to be relocated before it can be of any use it should not be placed in that spot in the first place!
527,18,7,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/1B1p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The best place for White's LSB. Be2 would be too passive (like Black's ...Be7) and Bd3 blocks an important pawn.
528,18,8,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1pp1bppp/p1n1pn2/1B1p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Asking the question to which there is only one good answer. I think maybe ...Bd7 should have been played first to avoid disrupting Black's queenside pawns so much but then again this will allow ...Bb7 and give Black a central cluster that might be put to good use.
529,18,9,Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1bp1bppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',With the doubled c-pawns and this Bishop move Black is prepared to switch plans entirely. He no longer has a real need to play ...e5; he can push c5 instead.
530,18,10,a4,b'r2qk2r/1bp1bppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/P7/1PN1PN2/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq a3',? I cannot think of a reason for playing this move. Surely 9.Ne5 was better.
531,18,11,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/1bp1bppp/p3pn2/2ppN3/P7/1PN1P3/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',?! Played now this move allows Black to play 10...d4 11.exd4 cxd4 and White must retreat his Nc3 to a suboptimal spot probably e2. Then it's up to Black to prove that he can hang on to the advanced pawn and make use of his extra space but his position looks pretty strong.
532,18,12,1f4,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/p2bpn2/2ppN3/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq f3',This pawn move is of course the reasoning behind White's previous move. It strengthens his Bishop's diagonal and may open the f-file against Black's uncastled King.
533,18,13,1Nd7,b'r2qk2r/1bpn1ppp/p2bp3/2ppN3/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black doubles up on the e5 square as well as freeing f6 for a possible supporting pawn. If White retreats his Knight to f3 12...e5 is inevitable and a firestorm begins. (13.fxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Bxe5 15.Qh5!? Bf6 with a pin on the Nc3 and control of d4 for Black and huge kingside pressure for White.)
534,18,14,1Qh5,b'r2qk2r/1bpn1ppp/p2bp3/2ppN2Q/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',? This is an outright mistake; I missed the obvious reply. 12.Ne2 was probably better using the Bishop to defend the Knight rather than the easily-harassed Queen.
535,18,15,1g6,b'r2qk2r/1bpn1p1p/p2bp1p1/2ppN2Q/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Of course.
536,18,16,1Nxg6,b'r2qk2r/1bpn1p1p/p2bp1N1/2pp3Q/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',! Making the best of the situation getting a pawn for the Knight and busting up Black's castle. Now White just has to prove he can do something with it.
537,18,17,1Qh3,b'r2qk2r/1bpn3p/p2bp1p1/2pp4/P4P2/1PN1P2Q/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',Poisonous. If Black advances the e-pawn he opens the f-file for White's artillery. On the other hand defending the pawn with 14...Qe7 loses material: 15.Nxd5! exd5 16.Bxh8. Black can hold with 14...Qf6 or 14...Nf8 but neither of those are very enticing options.
538,18,18,1Nf6,b'r2qk2r/1bp4p/p2bpnp1/2pp4/P4P2/1PN1P2Q/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',?! Right idea I think (not defending e6) but I kind of liked the Knight on d7. On f6 it may prove a vulnerability especially with a Rook on h8. I liked 14...d4! here with advantageous lines for Black arising after 15.Qxe6+ Qe7 16.Qxe7+ Bxe7 17.Ne2.
539,18,19,Qe7,b'r3k2r/1bp1q2p/p2bQnp1/2pp4/P4P2/1PN1P3/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',The reason I liked 14...d4 was that it forces White to make this exchange when it comes around. Now White is able to happily retreat his Queen where she can continue to make threats.
540,18,20,Bg4,b'r3k2r/2p1q2p/p2b1np1/2pp4/P4Pb1/1PN1PQ2/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',..or be threatened I suppose. This was a well-executed re-positioning of the Bishop by Black but I don't think it needed to be done. The Bishop was strong on b7.
541,18,21,Bf5,b'r3k2r/2p1q2p/p2b1np1/2pp1b2/P4P2/1PN1P1Q1/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',Aiming at the weak c-pawn as well as supporting e4 for a Knight. Unfortunately I think this move is just too wasteful as the threats are unimportant and it doesn't prevent White from carrying out his own plans. Black had a number of interesting options here among them ...d4 ...O-O-O and ...g5 but the text is not good enough to prevent the combination that comes next.
542,18,22,1Nxd5,b'r3k2r/2p1q2p/p2b1np1/2pN1b2/P4P2/1P2P1Q1/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',! White removes the threat of ...d4 once and for all threatens now to win the Nf6 with check activates the Bishop with a mighty pin and boots the BQ all at once!
543,18,23,1Ne4,b'r3k2r/2p1q2p/p2b2p1/2pN1b2/P3nP2/1P2P1Q1/1BPP2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',! This is the best response I think. Black is still losing material but now he can do so on his terms and besides--it's blitz and this is the showy aggressive move. In the heat of the game who knows which player has calculated correctly?
544,18,24,2Qe1,b'r3k2r/2p1q2p/p2b2p1/2pN1b2/P3nP2/1P2P3/1BPP2PP/R3QRK1 b kq -',White avoids the outright Queen trade because his Knight has an intermezzo available and he doesn't want to have to trade away his strong Bishop for the Black Rook which he of course would after 20.Nxe7 Nxg3 21.hxg3 Kxe7 22.Bxh8 Rxh8.
545,18,25,2Nxc7+,b'r3k2r/2N4p/p2bq1p1/2p2b2/P3nP2/1P2P3/1BPP2PP/R3QRK1 b kq -',There is only one response to the fork and White has accomplished his goal: trading the Knight for the Rook instead of the Bishop that actually makes the capture.
546,18,26,2Be5,b'r7/2b2k1p/p3q1p1/2p1Bb2/P3nP2/1P2P3/2PP2PP/R3QRK1 b - -',Now ahead in material but lacking badly in activity White needs to open lines so he offers a trade and a pawn as a poisoned incentive...
547,18,27,2fxe5,b'r7/5k1p/p3q1p1/2p1Pb2/P3n3/1P2P3/2PP2PP/R3QRK1 b - -',Now Black should play his King off the open f-file probably g7 is best and then follow up by constricting White's available options until he can perhaps win material back or force a draw.
548,18,28,2Qxe5,b'r7/5k1p/p5p1/2p1qb2/P3n3/1P2P3/2PP2PP/R3QRK1 w - -',?? But this is Blitz chess and if there's one place nasty traps thrive more than anywhere else it's here. Black takes the bait pawn and now all White must do is close the trap.
549,18,29,2g4,b'r7/5k1p/p5p1/2p1qb2/P3n1P1/1P2P3/2PP3P/R3QRK1 b - g3',1-0. After the exchange Black will have a Knight for a Rook and two pawns and huge positional weaknesses to boot so he understandably resigns. Many thanks to tony111 for a very fun game and thanks to all of you for reading. Comments are appreciated!

Obviously I'm not a Master or even Expert but as I had the White pieces it's my honor to do the annotation and if any Masters stop by to comment I'd definitely appreciate it. It's not a perfect game by any means but hopefully everyone can find something of use within. Here goes!
558,20,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The oldest[citation needed] of openings!
559,20,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The King's Gambit is one of my favorite openings on both sides of the board. I think it leads to fun and interesting play.
560,20,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Personally I think accepting the Gambit (2...exf4) is better. Then it's up to White to prove he can get something for the pawn!
561,20,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Both sides begin quick development.
562,20,5,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? This blunders a pawn! Now White can play 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.Nxe5 and come out a clear pawn ahead with a big central advantage and an attack on f7.
563,20,6,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White chooses to take the tempo rather than the material. Now Black should give up his central presence to maintain equality with 6...exf4 7.Bxf4 Be7.
564,20,7,b6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? Black's DSB could easily have been developed to g4 and his e-pawn is still hanging! As I said above best was 6...exf4.
565,20,8,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/4N3/1nB1P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White comes away a pawn to the good and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7.
566,20,9,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2bn2/4N3/1nB1P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is essentially Black's only good move. There's no other way to adequately defend f7.
567,20,10,1a3,b'r2qkb1r/p1p3pp/1p2pn2/4N3/1n2P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White exchanges Bishops to give Black a weak isolated e-pawn and to further weaken the vulnerable light squares a6 and c6. It's worth mentioning that White is not devoid of weaknesses--his Ne5 is undefended and he has no claim at all to the d4 square.
568,20,11,1Na6,b'r2qkb1r/p1p3pp/np2pn2/4N3/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',An ugly place for a Knight but it has a view of c5 and it didn't have anywhere else to go anyway.

570,20,13,1Bd6,b'r2qk2r/p1p3pp/np1bpn2/4N3/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? But this isn't it! Correct was 11...Qd4+! 12.Kh1 Qxe5 coming away with a free Knight.
571,20,14,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/p1pq2pp/np1bpn2/8/3NP3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',? Again White overlooks Black's chances along the c5-g1 diagonal. Now 13...Bc5 pins the Knight to the White King winning it for nothing!
572,20,15,1Be5,b'r3k2r/p1pq2pp/np2pn2/4b3/3NP3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? And again Black misses the tactic as well. As I said 13...Bc5 was the correct choice here. Now the Knight can escape with no trouble.

He still has a weak e-pawn but there's no direct threat at the moment and the file isn't open. He's also leading White in development. White for his part has far fewer pawn weaknesses (look at all the weak light squares around the Black King for comparison!) and slightly better central presence.
574,20,17,1Nxd4,b'2kr3r/p1pq2pp/np2pn2/8/3NP3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',Out of White's 16 moves six of them have been this Knight! It's no wonder he's behind in development. The thought behind this move is simple: White exchanges his Knight for the strong Bishop and draws the BQ to the center of the board where she'll be easy to harass. Getting rid of the Bishop makes White's dark-square weaknesses easier to defend--important because he has yet to develop his dark Bishop!
575,20,18,1Qe2,b'2kr3r/p1p3pp/np2pn2/8/3qP3/P1NP4/1PP1Q1PP/R1B2R1K b - -',White prepares to connect his Rooks bolsters e3 in preparation for a Bishop that might want to land there and takes aim at Black's undefended Knight from behind the d3 pawn.

580,20,23,1Qe5,b'2k2r1r/p1p3p1/np2pn2/4q2p/4P3/P1NPB3/1PP1Q1PP/R4R1K w - -',? This is too aggressive; better was ...Qd7. In the text Black takes aim at h2 (perhaps contemplating a follow-up with ...Ng4) but his Queen is too easy to chase around here in the center. White has his pick of harassing options but the best by far is...
581,20,24,2d4,b'2k2r1r/p1p3p1/np2pn2/4q2p/3PP3/P1N1B3/1PP1Q1PP/R4R1K b - -',! Jabbing at the BQ as well as discovering the Queen's attack on the Na6. Black's only move is 20...Qa5 but even that is looking pretty grim after 21.b4 Nxb4 22.axb4 Qxb4.
582,20,25,2Qd6,b'2k2r1r/p1p3p1/np1qpn2/7p/3PP3/P1N1B3/1PP1Q1PP/R4R1K w - -',? a5 looked like a kind of dangerous place to run but as I explained above it was best. Now White picks up two Knights instead of one! Right here the game comes to the downhill part of the journey and accelerates quickly toward its end.

586,20,29,2Nxd5,b'3k1r1r/p1p5/Qpq2p2/3N3p/8/P3B3/1PP3PP/R4R1K b - -',...But in reality by pushing d4-d5 White has opened the d-file for a Rook so Black cannot take the Knight: 25...Qxd5?? 26.Rad1 wins the Queen.
587,20,30,2f5,b'3k1r1r/p1p5/Qpq5/3N1p1p/8/P3B3/1PP3PP/R4R1K w - -',The GK computer thinks this is a blunder but really Black ought to be credited for sticking with it at all in this position. It would be absolutely understandable for him to resign right here as he is down two minor pieces with no possible counterplay.
588,20,31,Ke8,b'4kr1r/p1p5/Qpq5/3N1p1p/8/P3B3/1PP3PP/3R1R1K w - -',Getting off the dangerous d-file (though this actually allows the WQ to penetrate and set up a mating net there was really nothing Black could have done at this point).
589,20,32,Kg7,b'5r1r/p1p3k1/1pq5/3N1Q1p/8/P3B3/1PP3PP/3R1R1K w - -',Mate is inevitable. White simply has too many pieces.

To me this was a pivotal move in the game. If you'd taken the bishop I would have felt that I was losing. I realize your knight had a great position but e6 would easily drive it away so saddling me with double pawns and allowing your queen to stay near my queen would have been scarier."

I delay moving the d pawn just to see what his intentions are in the middle because of how he opened. Perhaps this is a bit too passive as white but I want an indication of whether black really intends to fight for the middle from afar or if he has another plan altogether. Remember I am not thinking I am going to win this game; his rating is by far the highest I've ever played against. As such I have no clue as to what he could possibly be thinking and I want a clue. Badly. ;)
670,24,3,c5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',Okay now we're getting somewhere. Were I more knowledgeable about openings I may have recognized this as his intention. Since I didn't initially recognize this black opening I just develop pieces with the idea of attacking the Kingside later.

In this position I now feel comfortable that I have a few moves before major fireworks occur unless black wishes to open up the middle immediately. I don't expect him to because players of his caliber prefer complicated positions generally speaking.
673,24,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Expected.

I am trying to tempt him to take my knight with that black bishop in return for a screwed up white pawn position. I am still to be honest intimidated by his rating. It's a real weapon psychology in chess. And so I right now have played rather passively. Things will soon change.
675,24,8,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Wasn't Nf6 a possibility here? He wishes to castle and now hints of tactics are in play.

677,24,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Now this is perfectly fine for black but now I am beginning to form my own real plan and I'm glad he's finally castled Kingside. Why? Here's why: against a much stronger player why not launch an attack against his Kingside in a most... ugly way perhaps he'll underestimate the danger against someone rated so much lower! It's worth a shot; perhaps I don't give myself enough credit but honestly in a long positional struggle I think this player would eat me alive so to speak!
678,24,11,Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1NPBN2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is a slow plan and easily thwarted but black lets me do this.

I would have thought by now he'd be blowing up the queenside and then grind me down with superior chess. This looks suspiciously like a Sicilian. Which I might add I LIKE playing against as white. It is a pet peeve of mine that so many black players play the Sicilian so I have spent a lot of personal time developing my own way of defeating it which usually works if black playes too passively. The whole point of the Sicilian is to play aggressively... and black fails to do this. This IS a Sicilian now is it not? Dragon formation? And to the comment on ...d5 perhaps you are right. But white can get two pawns and perhaps black did not want the point for the central pawn control. I ought to analyze that continuation; it's possible he was playing so fast he missed it and I confess I did not see it.

682,24,15,1Rab1,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1NPBN2/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',This is a purely defensive move the last one I'll really make.

My reasoning is I want him to play c4 so I am trying to provoke him into it. But he isn't ready to do that yet. The white bishop is very uncomfortable right now but I'm willing to suffer it. Black has tactics now on the queenside. In a normal Sicilian black would push hard against the queenside. But... I'm castled on the Kingside. So what he does next makes sense I suppose.
685,24,18,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p1npp1p1/1pp5/4P3/PBNPBN2/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Developing and now I wonder if he's really contemplating a kingside move when to my eyes a black queenside push is still called for. His pieces are not fully coordinated in my opinion... not yet. But looking at this as we played quickly I felt sure his position was still superior to white's. So I decided to change things up some.
686,24,19,1Bh6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p1npp1pB/1pp5/4P3/PBNP1N2/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',My good bishop was actually doing very little. I'd rather trade these off and then try to take advantage of the resulting dark-squared weaknesses. I am sure black had something good coming for him and I couldn't wait to just let him do what he wished to. No doubt some analysis here would show things I missed or he missed; but this was a blitz game and as noted I'm still intimidated. I only wish to give him a decent game and lose graciously.
687,24,20,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p2pp1pB/1pp5/3nP3/PBNP1N2/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',If I were to guess I'd say this was a great move by black. He wants to crash those pawns down and does so threatening my white bishop at the same time. I took a moment to consider options here and decided I could not let that knight sit there at all nor allow black to initiate the pawn trades. So...
688,24,21,1Nxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p2pp1pB/1pp5/3NP3/PBNP4/1PPQ1PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',I took it.

690,24,23,e5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npbp/p2p2pB/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P4/1PPQNPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Protecting the pawn. But this is a passive move. Now at this point I would be worried about black playing f5 eventually if he also had pressure down the c file. But because of the white square white bishop and lack of c file pressure this is not a real concern at this point to me not yet. Right now I am worried about ...d5 despite my bishop. Why am I worried? I don't want to allow black to begin to break through to my king. Black has played - in my eyes - amazingly passive up to this point. I don't understand it but hey. Finally I can begin to make the moves I've been waiting to make.
691,24,24,1Bxg7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2npBp/p2p2p1/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P4/1PPQNPPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Now many of you chess players out there may be tempted to accuse me of throwing away my black bishop for no compensation. His black bishop at this point is not doing much. But that's not the point. Here's my point: looking ahead that black bishop with an open center - which black can open eventually - will be a major pain. And how useful is my bishop really in this position? Yes it's in a good place. But I'd rather loosen up Black's kingside immediately by trading that bishop now even though some of you will disagree. Even though that means the black king will be off the a2-g8 diagonal. Will I be proved right here? Probably not without inaccurate play by the 2375 Yakimov but I do it anyways.
692,24,25,1Kxg7,b'r2q1r2/1b2npkp/p2p2p1/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P4/1PPQNPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Retakes.

695,24,28,1f5,b'r2q1r2/1b2n1kp/p2p1pp1/1p2pP2/3pP3/PB1P4/1PPQN1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Yes I am willing to trade pawns open the center and allow threats against my white King because black's King right now will be horribly exposed. To his credit black realizes this but now I have created a chink in black's armor and I pursue it. Would analysis indicate opening up the position to be survivable for black and give him a great attack on my King? I'm not sure. My king is also on g1 and perhaps ought to be on h1 but as it turns out it did not need to be.
696,24,29,1g5,b'r2q1r2/1b2n1kp/p2p1p2/1p2pPp1/3pP3/PB1P4/1PPQN1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',I really did not expect this. I expected a bloody battle up there around f5. Black can really hit back now in the center and break things wide open and in my estimation - again without analysis - should do so immediately if nothing else but to get rid of my powerful white bishop. I fully expect him to soon. The white squares around black's king are very weak and the black squares are not all that secure. I am really loving my white bishop right now.
697,24,30,1Ng3,b'r2q1r2/1b2n1kp/p2p1p2/1p2pPp1/3pP3/PB1P2N1/1PPQ2PP/1R3RK1 b - -',This really shouldn't get anywhere but black mishandles things on the kingside shortly.

I've heard it said that the best defense is a good offense but black is still passive here despite all the tactical threats I can see. Look at how my white pawns inhibit my activity on the queenside. I really don't have much there at all besides my white squared bishop. A powerful counterattack in the middle/queenside by black a bit earlier may have changed this game's outcome but now black is going to face serious difficulties. On his part should black have played d5 by now?
701,24,34,2Nh5+,b'r3q2r/1b2n1kp/p2p1p2/1p2pPpN/3pP3/PB1P4/1PP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Here black thought a while. He has to know that h4 is coming. Suddenly that white bishop is a powerhouse. He'll have to do something about it soon.

I've played games against someone who always gets their queen out and takes a pawn so as to give me queen odds. I have yet to beat him too amazingly enough. I don't know who it is but each time we play I come tantalizingly close to beating him only to lose to his greatly superior positional strength. I'm sure many of you have played that player too. Just sayin. I have to say this in this game; I used it once in a previously annotated game. But black has simply dithered around too long. Perhaps he was interested in just seeing what I would do maybe just looking for ideas for later thought. After all this is an unrated game. And I'm totally random to him.
703,24,36,2Nxf6,b'r3qk1r/1b2n2p/p2p1N2/1p2pPp1/3pP3/PB1P4/1PP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',This is practically forced for white to do.

Perhaps black thought he'd survive the storm with a crushing attack down on the white's kingside. I don't know. Black can resign now but plays on for a while. Why do I say black can resign? Because not only is he down material his King has no where to run and he won't muster up a good enough defense to stop white's attack. I still can't believe this player with this rating allowed this position to be reached.
705,24,38,d5,b'r1q2k1r/1b2n2p/p4N2/1p1ppPpQ/3pP3/PB1P4/1PP3PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Too little too late. This should have happened ages ago.

I felt sure he'd promptly show me what he was really capable of and I myself just got off of a 12 hour night shift and was tired. Moral of the story: yes you can play too passively and lose games you should not lose.

Ardin (Sonata) was trying to get his revenge against me for his defeat in the Allgaier Gambit.  Ardin plays a good solid game until something happens and he loses the exchange.  After this I spend a lot of time contemplating just how I am gonna convert this advantage into a victory.  Then I had a lightbulb moment and unfortunately for Ardin he was hit by a Glenda generated bolt of white lightening!  So how does this happen well read on."

Then I got my lightening moment.  I realised that Glenda could now plonk herself on c6 threatening Ardin's rook.  In fact looking even more closely that rook cannot be saved due to a queen fork on c7 if the rook moves to b8.  I then made that move.  Ardin sees that he will be 8 points down on material two moves down the line and so on the grounds of ruinous loss of material he decided to resign! Commiserations Ardin and good luck in your other games!  Kind regards - Joanne

774,29,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops the King's knight to deter e4 and indirectly contest the center.
775,29,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Generally agreed to be the most assertive move for White c4 contests the vacant d5 from the wing and infers a plan to develop the knight behind it to support a potential e4.
776,29,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Pushing the pawn out one square to resume control over d5 and freeing the King's bishop. The plan is to play either the Nimzo-Indian (3.Nc3) or transpose to the Benoni (3.Nf3 where the f-pawn is blocked - of course the QID is also possible).
777,29,3,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',?! A somewhat dubious move. White is obviously anticipating and looking to prevent the Bb4 pin but this allows Black to equalise easily. Developing either knight was the stronger option. 
778,29,4,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Punching back in the center asking White to decide upon a plan for his center. (A benoni-type position is still possible with 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 but Black is gaining control over the initiative if 4.dxc5 then 4...Bxc4 and Black can be quite pleased with the position and if 4.Nf3 then 4...cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nc6 and Black can still be content.) 
779,29,5,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White instead opts to play e3 to open the bishop and reinforce the d-pawn although with c5 already on the board the exchange will give up the central e-pawn.
780,29,6,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2Pp4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Exchanging the wing pawn to gain the stronger core center and the semi-open c-file to fight through.
781,29,7,exd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The stronger way to gain back on material (If 5.Qxd4? then 5...Nc6 and Black is quite far ahead in development) but White's central pawn position is now potentially susceptible to exchange and isolation through a supported and well-timed d5 thrust.
782,29,8,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"We know the bishop is going here - it's the only square available (or that doesn't block a central pawn advance) we're looking to castle kingside and it's a decent square to ""support the support"" (and if the Knight on f6 moves can always shift to f6 where it nicely controls the center and hits some weak pawns/squares)."
783,29,9,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',These next few moves are quite natural development - Nc3 to develop the Queen's knight to increase control in the center castling and Bd3 to get the bishop to an open diagonal and allow for castling.
784,29,10,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB4/1P3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',At this point the d5 thrust was certainly viable but I felt no rush to play it and instead waited to first set up the queenside fianchetto with the bishop cutting down the open diagonal to the kingside.
785,29,11,h3,b'rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB3P/1P3PP1/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',?! I'm calling this one dubious as there were no threats prevented and no gains made that I can see - it only serves to delay finishing development. Nf3 was the best move. (8.Nf3 Bb7 9.O-O d5 10.cxd5 Nxd5)
786,29,12,d5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ d6',And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the d5 thrust expecting to isolate the pawn. 
787,29,13,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White castles as it is imperitive to get the King to safety when things are opening up. If instead 10.cxd5 Nxd5 or if 10.c5 bxc5 11.dxc5 Bxc5/Nbd7 and possibly 12.b4 for nice complications for both sides.
788,29,14,1dxc4,b'rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/8/2pP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The Queen's pawn has now been isolated to provide a target to play against. I'm quite content with Black's position here - open c-file and semi-open d-file to the isolani for the rooks the bishops cutting out through those open files no major pawn weaknesses and no major concession to the center. The Queen's knight is obviously not developed (yet) but there was no rush as it could operate effectively from a few squares in these types of positions - of course with an isolated pawn on d4 Nc6 will be best now.
789,29,15,1Bxc4,b'rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White captures to even up material.

791,29,17,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1BN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White develops his bishop to defend the pawn (currently at two attackers three defenders).
792,29,18,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1BN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Grabbing the open file and creating the threat of a discovered attack on the (currently) hanging bishop.
793,29,19,1Bd3,b'2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White retreats the bishop to a fairly strong square that can battery up in front of a Queen on c2 hitting h7 in case the King's knight moves however it cuts the communication with one of the isolani's defenders.
794,29,20,1Nd5,b'2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/3n4/3P4/P1NBBN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Although this leaves the position open to the somewhat ugly looking 14.Qc2 g6 15.Bh6 Re8 Nd5 results in a nicely centralised knight blockading the isolani (and hitting the supporting bishop) with a line for the dark squared bishop to attack it from f6. 
795,29,21,1Nxd5,b'2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/3N4/3P4/P2BBN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Fortunately my opponent decides to exchange which allows for continuation of pressuring d4.

797,29,23,1b4,b'2r2rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/3q4/1P1P4/P2BBN1P/5PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',White pushes to gain some elbow room on the queenside taking a5 as a possibility from Black's knight and perhaps intending a future b5.

800,29,26,1Bf6,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1pn1pb2/3q4/1P1P4/P3BN1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And with Bf6 we have tipped it in our favour as White has run out of defenders.
801,29,27,1Qa4,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1pn1pb2/3q4/QP1P4/P3BN1P/4BPP1/R4RK1 b - -',White gives up on the pawn and instead looks to generate some counterplay against the a-pawn which will hang but the Queen is unable to immediately follow through (for example 17...Nxd4 18.Qxa7 Nxe2+ 19.Kh1 and the winning Qxf3 which leads to mate or netting the white lady a little further into the exhange line with the isolani and she becomes trapped 17...Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxd4 19.Qxa7 Ra8).
802,29,28,1Nxd4,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1p2pb2/3q4/QP1n4/P3BN1P/4BPP1/R4RK1 w - -',With the balance in our favour we follow through with the attack and exchanges. Note how we get the nice Queen bishop battery along the a8-h1 diagonal.
803,29,29,1Rad1,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1p2p3/3q4/QP1b4/P4N1P/4BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',A nice move taking up opposition on the open file and pinning Black's queen however the Queen and Bishop are easily protected by the supported e5.
804,29,30,2Nh4,b'2rr2k1/pb3ppp/1p6/3qp3/QP1b3N/P6P/4BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',White repositions the knight (while protecting the g2 mating threat from Queen and Bishop that he just opened - eg. 20.Nxd4 Qxg2#) but I'm not certain what he was planning here.
805,29,31,2Bc6,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1pb5/3qp3/QP1b3N/P6P/4BPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Attacking the Queen - after 21.Qxa7 Rd7 22.Qa6 Ra8 23.Qc4 Qxc4 24.Bxc4 Rxa3 Black has successfully traded down.
806,29,32,2b5,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1pb5/1P1qp3/Q2b3N/P6P/4BPP1/3R1RK1 b - -',White however looks to counter with the pawn however Black has a powerful response...
807,29,33,2Qe4,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1pb5/1P2p3/Q2bq2N/P6P/4BPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',With Qe4 we accomplish quite a few things - we hit the hanging knight and the hanging bishop but also with the threat of if 22.bxc6 then Bxf2+ opens an attack on and wins the hanging Queen.
808,29,34,2Bc4,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1pb5/1P2p3/Q1Bbq2N/P6P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',A nice move cutting the line between the Queens after the potential Bxf2+
809,29,35,2Bd5,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1p6/1P1bp3/Q1Bbq2N/P6P/5PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',So we attack that blocked line with bishop and rook while protecting our threatened bishop (if Bxd5 then it re-opens).
810,29,36,2Nf3,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1p6/1P1bp3/Q1Bbq3/P4N1P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',White retreats the hanging knight to a stronger defensive post striking into the center occupied by Black.

814,29,40,2Qe7,b'3r2k1/4Qppp/1p4q1/1P1bp3/2rb4/P4N1P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',The White Lady threatens the undefended rook but with open lines and communication channels we mitigate the threat through Rdc8. Also possible was Ra8 threatening to win another pawn.
815,29,41,2Nh4,b'2r3k1/4Qppp/1p4q1/1P1bp3/2rb3N/P6P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',White Knight again to h4 looking for to make the Queen dance.

817,29,43,2g4,b'2r3k1/4Qppp/1p6/1P1bp2q/2rb2PN/P6P/5P2/3R1RK1 b - g3',White weakens up the King's castle which is extremely dangerous with two bishops bearing down upon it looking to kick the Queen again.  However with Qh6 there is no follow through (eg. 28.g5 Qxh4 or 28.Nf5 Qxh3).
818,29,44,2Qh6,b'2r3k1/4Qppp/1p5q/1P1bp3/2rb2PN/P6P/5P2/3R1RK1 w - -',Additionally on h6 we end up with three heavy pieces converging on c1 which has only the two rooks in defense along the back. In addition we have a check available with Bxf2+ as a potential move to draw out a defender.
819,29,45,2Rd3,b'2r3k1/4Qppp/1p5q/1P1bp3/2rb2PN/P2R3P/5P2/5RK1 b - -',I suspect White was looking at a lift to enable the rook to f3 but the game is now won for White with a pretty combination.

This rather commits White to either castling queenside or not castling at all which both seem high-risk options given the way that Black's pieces are arranged.

I was thinking about the thread in my Club about which piece you would rather have in a B v N endgame.  Many people would say the bishop!  Well I had the bishop my opponent had the knight (and the lower chess rating at the time the game was played!) and I lost!  Here is how it happened.  The first three moves are the French Exchange Variation so I start commentary on move 4."

855,31,6,Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppb2ppp/2p5/3nN3/3P4/7P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',15. ..... Nxd5 - there have been a plethora of exchanges and now there are two enemy cavalry standing side by side.  My knight could be driven off e5 at any time though.  Xeno's cannot and this is the start of another attack of passivitis for yours truly.
856,31,7,1Nc4,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/1bp5/3n4/2NP4/1Q2B2P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',18. Nc4 - my knight moves off e5 to rid myself of that turbulent dark square prelate on b6.

It is beginning to dawn on me that I will soon be in a zugzwang.  Note:  Fou Lenoir est tres Fou!  Porquoi?  Il est sur les memes carrés coloeurs de ses pions!  The only pawn I have not on dark squares is the one on b3.

870,31,21,5Bxb6,b'8/7p/1B4p1/1p3pP1/5P1P/n1k5/4K3/8 b - -',53. Bxb6 - the pawn on a3 goes for the pawn on b6.  Alas there is still the black pawn on b5 and as there are still 3 black pawns left on the board I cannot sac Fou Lenoir for the pawn.  It will only delay the end not prevent it.
871,31,22,5Be5+,b'8/7p/6p1/4BpP1/1pn2P1P/2k5/4K3/8 b - -',55. Be5+ - a last gasp trap.  If NxB trading down to K & P ending the b pawn will crown but my e pawn would then crown the move after and material would be equal in the Q and P ending.  It was not to be Xeno simply moved his king and as I said in a previous note that pawn will crown unless Fou Lenoir sacrifices himself for it and I reiterate it would only delay the end which I did not wish to do.  It was time to give in gracefully.  Well played Xenophon!  Kind regards Joanne

I've discovered that this might be a weakness of the dragon...in my past games it has seemed to depend on the pawn structure and bishop remaining in that formation. I might need to think of a defense that can answer this threat if I'm to continue using it.

At this point I was considering a knight sacrifice for one of the pawns probably the g4 pawn to break up the attack since I've experienced previous games where pawn attacks were devastating. However I didn't want my opponent to gain a material lead so early in the game. I foolishly decided to try and keep building my own attack.

Directly of course the queen is under threat ignoring the pawn at g7 not to mention the mate in one Qxf2 or the fork opportunity at c7 the instinct was BxK but then BxB and still all sorts of threats. That one move was responsible for about 6 years off my life."

1047,38,13,fxe6,b'r3k2r/6p1/2ppp3/pp6/4P3/P2P2P1/1P3K1P/4R3 w kq -',I end up a rook up so a more technical analysis will probably show 21 Ke6... as a mistake. But its a tactic I often employ myself. When under the cosh attack back people get scared people make mistakes. It doesn't always work of course as in this case but it really did make me think. When it works it tends to totally throw the other player as their mind dwells on it and they weaken themselves.
1048,38,14,3Rh3,b'5r2/3k4/2p1p3/pp1pP3/3P3r/P6R/1P4K1/8 b - -',I felt the rook exchange there wasn't in white's best interests which is why I grab it...
1049,38,15,Rf2,b'8/3k4/2p1p3/pp1pP3/3P4/P6K/1P3r2/8 w - -',And at that point my opponent decides its a lost cause. But having been there and done it and had it done to me on more than one occasion that 21st move was well worth it. It so nearly paid off and if it had then kudos for the courage to make it.

1069,39,19,e5,b'7r/R2bk1p1/5p1q/4p3/8/5PB1/P5K1/5R2 w - -',The reasoning here well Q-h3 pushes the king to f2 he is still safe and there isn't much I can do to attack him. So I'm trying to free up the pinned bishop.
