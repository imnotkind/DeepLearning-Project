Dark square bishop will likely be captured next move.  I'm looking at g1 and g3 as potentially good places to put my rooks (though the rook on the d-file is happy enough for now).  For the moment despite being down in material I believe I have a slight mobility advantage.  To free up his N & lsb I expect black's rook will move to c8 (or poss Q to c7 or d7).  So any mobility advantage will vanish very soon.

He has these strong knights much easier play especially on the queenside where he can slowly advance the pawns and white right now is full of weaknesses and whites pieces are uncordinated inactive and will take a very long time to be made use of. However it seems to me that white has some good long term prospects with some accurate play. the key being that if white can get to an endgame he will be practially won. With blacks king completely out of play black would be effectivly a piece down since come endgame the kings become very useful attacking pieces as well as that black will have a permanant back rank weakness.

256,12,13,fxe6,b'rn2k2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/4p3/4P2P/P4P2/1PP3P1/R1BK2NR w kq -',However this was a bad move because I now have two bad pawns on the e square.
257,12,14,1Ne2,b'rn2k2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/4p3/4P2P/P4P2/1PP1N1P1/R1BK3R b kq -',At this point I attempt to threaten him with Nxh1 by playing Nh5 then Ng3.  Therefore he prevent this potential threat by playing Ne2. 
258,12,15,1Nc6,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/2n1pn2/4p3/4P2P/P4P2/1PP1N1P1/R1BK3R w kq -',I am not sure why I picked this candidate or what this move does in the long term.
259,12,16,1b4,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/2n1pn2/4p3/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1N1P1/R1BK3R b kq b3',I do not know what he was thinking when he picked this move unless he was trying to put pressure on the b square.
260,12,17,1Rd8+,b'3rk2r/ppp3pp/2n1pn2/4p3/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1N1P1/R1BK3R w k -',At this point I check him in order to prevent him from castling.  I forgot however that he could have played Bd2 and still castle but he did not think about that possibility either.
261,12,18,1Ke1,b'3rk2r/ppp3pp/2n1pn2/4p3/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1N1P1/R1B1K2R b k -',Now that he moved the king it is no longer feasible for him to castle as I mentioned earlier.
262,12,19,1Nd4,b'3rk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/4p3/1P1nP2P/P4P2/2P1N1P1/R1B1K2R w k -',At this point I play Nd4 to force an exchange with Nxe2 and Kxe2.
263,12,20,1Kd1,b'3rk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/4p3/1P1nP2P/P4P2/2P1N1P1/R1BK3R b k -',I cannot figure out why he chose to play Kd1 as opposed to leaving his king on e1 or playing Kf1.  That is because he is put himself into a discover check during the exchange because my rook is on the d square.
264,12,21,h5,b'3rk2r/ppp3p1/4pn2/4p2p/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1K1P1/R1B4R w k h6',I played h5 in order to stop his pawn on the h square from advancing further.  However I do not why I chose this candidate because he would not have been able to play h5 regardless because of my knight on f6. 
265,12,22,1Bg5,b'3rk2r/ppp3p1/4pn2/4p1Bp/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1K1P1/R6R b k -',He plays Bg5 in his attempt to force an exchange with Bxf6 and gxf6 but I do not allow this to happen.
266,12,23,1O-O,b'3r1rk1/ppp3p1/4pn2/4p1Bp/1P2P2P/P4P2/2P1K1P1/R6R w - -',I could have exchanged his pieces but I decided to castle on the king's since this is my favorite move but this also prevents him from exchanging the pieces because of my rook on f8.
267,12,24,1g4,b'3r1rk1/ppp3p1/4pn2/4p1Bp/1P2P1PP/P4P2/2P1K3/R6R b - g3',He plays g4 in order to force an exchange with hxg4 and fxg4.
268,12,25,Rd4,b'5rk1/ppp3p1/4pn2/4p1B1/1P1rP1PP/P7/2P1K3/R6R w - -',That was not a good move.  Instead I could have gotten a free pawn if I had Nxe4.  However I do not think at all so I make a sudden and quick judgement when I play Rd4.
269,12,26,1Bxf6,b'5rk1/ppp3p1/4pB2/4p3/1P1rP1PP/P7/2P1K3/R6R b - -',Now he forces an exchange with Bxf6 and gxf6.
270,12,27,2Ke3,b'5rk1/ppp5/4pp2/4p3/1P1rP1PP/P3K3/2P5/R6R b - -',At this point he plays Ke3 in his to put pressure on my rook.
271,12,28,2Rfd8,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp2/4p3/1P1rP1PP/P3K3/2P5/R6R w - -',I respond by connecting and doubling my rooks.
272,12,29,2h5,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp2/4p2P/1P1rP1P1/P3K3/2P5/R6R b - -',At this point he is trying to get a pawn promotion but I am just as determined to prevent this from happening.
273,12,30,2Rd4d2,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp2/4p2P/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2Pr4/R6R w - -',I respond by playing Rd2 in my attempt to capture his free pawn with Rxc2 because he cannot play Kxd2 since my other rook is also on the d square.
274,12,31,2Rac1,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp2/4p2P/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2Pr4/2R4R b - -',He protects the pawn with Rac1.
275,12,32,2Rd2d6,b'3r2k1/ppp5/3rpp2/4p2P/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2P5/2R4R w - -',I do not know why I made that move or what it is going to do.
276,12,33,2Rcf1,b'3r2k1/ppp5/3rpp2/4p2P/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2P5/5R1R b - -',Now he plays Rcf1 in his attempt to capture a free pawn with Rxf6. 
277,12,34,2Rd6d2,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp2/4p2P/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2Pr4/5R1R w - -',In response I threaten to play Rxc2 and capture one of his pawns if he played Rxf6.  I also could have protected my pawn on f6 with Rf8 but the thought did not occur to me.
278,12,35,2h6,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp1P/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2Pr4/5R1R b - -',At this point he is trying to get a pawn promotion. 
279,12,36,2Rxc2,b'3r2k1/ppp5/4pp1P/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/5R1R w - -',I respond by capturing a free pawn with Rxc2.
280,12,37,2h7+,b'3r2k1/ppp4P/4pp2/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/5R1R b - -',He tries to trick me so that he could get the promotion by checking me.
281,12,38,2Kg7,b'3r4/ppp3kP/4pp2/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/5R1R w - -',I could not have played Kf8 or he would have checked me with his pawn promotion and won my free rook.  I also could not have played Kh8 because he would have been able to capture a free pawn with Rxc6 so Kg7 was my best and only choice. 
282,12,39,2Rfd1,b'3r4/ppp3kP/4pp2/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/3R3R b - -',He decides to play Rd1 in order to force an exchange with Rxd1 and Rxd1 but I do not let this happen.
283,12,40,2Rh8,b'7r/ppp3kP/4pp2/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/3R3R w - -',Instead I play Rh8 to put pressure on the h square.
284,12,41,2Rd7+,b'7r/pppR2kP/4pp2/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/7R b - -',He responds by checking me.
285,12,42,2Kg6,b'7r/pppR3P/4ppk1/4p3/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/7R w - -',"I cannot play Kg8 because he would check me and win my free rook with Kh8+ so I ""quick play"" with Kg6."
286,12,43,2Rh5,b'7r/pppR3P/4ppk1/4p2R/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/8 b - -',He therefore responds with Rh5 but I do not know why chose that candidate because pawn on h7 was already protected by his rook on the h square. 
287,12,44,2b5,b'7r/p1pR3P/4ppk1/1p2p2R/1P2P1P1/P3K3/2r5/8 w - b6',I figured that I would prevent his pawn from advancing further with h5 but I do not why I made that move either because he would not have been able to get a promotion since my rook on the second row or column.  Instead I force an exchange with Rxc7 and Rxc7 and it is great because I exchange my pawn for his rook.  
288,12,45,3Kf3,b'7r/p1r4P/4ppk1/1p2p2R/1P2P1P1/P4K2/8/8 b - -',After he moves his king I force another great exchange.  That is because I capture more pieces then him because I capture with two of my pieces but he only captures with only one piece.  This exchange occurs when Rhxh7 Rxh7 and Kxh7 are played.
289,12,46,3Kg3,b'8/p1r4k/4pp2/1p2p3/1P2P1P1/P5K1/8/8 b - -',I cannot figure out why he chose that candidate.
290,12,47,3Rc3+,b'8/p6k/4pp2/1p2p3/1P2P1P1/P1r3K1/8/8 w - -',At this point I decide to check him in order to capture his free pawn with Rxa3.
291,12,48,3Kg2,b'8/p6k/4pp2/1p2p3/1P2P1P1/r7/6K1/8 b - -',I do not know what he was thinking when he moved the king because he was not in check.
292,12,49,3Ra4,b'8/p6k/4pp2/1p2p3/rP2P1P1/8/6K1/8 w - -',I played Ra4 in order to capture his free pawn later in the game.
293,12,50,3Kh3,b'8/p6k/4pp2/1p2p3/rP2P1P1/7K/8/8 b - -',I do not know the logic behind Kh3.
294,12,51,3f5,b'8/p6k/4p3/1p2pp2/rP2P1P1/7K/8/8 w - -',At this point I play f5 in order to force a series of exchanges with exf5 exf5 gxf5 and Rxb4.
295,12,52,3f6,b'8/p6k/5P2/1p2p3/1r6/7K/8/8 b - -',Now he plays f6 in another attempt to get a pawn promotion but unlike my game against anitam I do not let this happen. 
296,12,53,3Rf4,b'8/p6k/5P2/1p2p3/5r2/7K/8/8 w - -',I play Rf4 in order to prevent him from getting the promotion.
297,12,54,3f7,b'8/p4P1k/8/1p2p3/5r2/7K/8/8 b - -',He still is determined to get the promotion and probably does not see my rook or thinks that he could slip away but I do not have a nonchalant attitude about this. 
298,12,55,3Rxf7,b'8/p4r1k/8/1p2p3/8/7K/8/8 w - -',Therefore I capture his pawn with Rxf7.
299,12,56,4Kg2,b'8/p4r1k/8/1p2p3/8/8/6K1/8 b - -',Now all he can do is move his king and he continues to do this in his attempt to capture my pawn.  However I make sure that he cannot do this.  
300,12,57,4Re7,b'8/p3r2k/8/1p2p3/8/8/6K1/8 w - -',For example he played Kg2 earlier in his attempt to play Kxe5 but I respond with Re7 to protect the pawn on e5.
301,12,58,a5,b'8/4r2k/8/pp2p3/8/8/5K2/8 w - a6',I could have played e5 and would have still gotten the promotion but I play a5 in order to trick him and make it difficult for him to tell what pawn I would promote.  
302,12,59,4Ke2,b'8/4r2k/8/pp2p3/8/8/4K3/8 b - -',Now he is more determined to capture the pawn but he knows that he cannot make the capture on the e square because of my rook.  Therefore he is trying to capture my pawns on the b square followed by the a square but I am not about to let this happen.
303,12,60,4a4,b'8/4r2k/8/1p2p3/p7/8/4K3/8 w - -',I now play a4 because he could no longer play Kxa4 at the current moment because of my other pawn on b5.
304,12,61,4Kd2,b'8/4r2k/8/1p2p3/p7/8/3K4/8 b - -',Now he is trying to trick me I am not going to be fooled by that.
305,12,62,4b4,b'8/4r2k/8/4p3/pp6/8/3K4/8 w - -',I decide to play b4 because it brings me one step closer to getting the promotion.
306,12,63,4Kc2,b'8/4r2k/8/4p3/pp6/8/2K5/8 b - -',I do not know why played Kc2 instead of Kd3.  Kd3 might have allowed him to capture a free pawn with Kxb4 in the long run.  Now he is going to be checked with b3+ and there is nothing he can do about that because the possibility of capturing my pawn Kxb3 is now gone since the other pawn is on a4.  The only thing he can do at this point is run away from danger with Kb2 or Kc3. 
307,12,64,e4,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p3p3/1p6/1K6/8 w - -',At this point I do not check him again with a3+ because this would allow him to capture a free pawn with Kxb3 followed by another free pawn with Kxa3 or Kxa2.  Instead I decide to play e4 and I know that he cannot capture my pawn on the e square because of my rook on e7.  That way he is unable to capture my pawn on b4 as well as e4.   
308,12,65,4Ka3,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p3p3/Kp6/8/8 b - -',In this position he threatens to play Kxa3 and capture a free pawn but I figured that I would let him.  If he played Kxa4 I would respond with b2 and he would not be able to stop the promotion.
309,12,66,4Rb7,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p3p3/Kp6/8/8 w - -',I could have played Rb7 instead of Ra7.  That would prevent him from playing Rxa3 but I played Rb7 instead.  That way I will be able to get the pawn promotion because he would not be able to play Kxb3 even if I had played e3 right away and he is almost pin because his only options are Kxa4 or Kb2.   
310,12,67,4Kb2,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p3p3/1p6/1K6/8 b - -',He chose Kb2 in order to block my pawn on b3 and prevent me from checking him with a3+.
311,12,68,4e3,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p7/1p2p3/1K6/8 w - -',I respond with e3 in order to trick him and put pressure on his king.
312,12,69,4Kc1,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p7/1p2p3/8/2K5 b - -',He responds with Kc1 in his attempt to stop my pawn promotion but it does not work.
313,12,70,4e2,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p7/1p6/4p3/2K5 w - -',I thought he would capture my pawn with Kxb2 if I had checked him with b2+ but I forgot that he would not have been able to do this because of my rook on b7.  Since that happened I played e2 instead of b2 but it does not matter anyway.  That is because he would not have been checkmated right away since he would have been able to play Kc2 and I now have a pass pawn.  In this position I will get a pawn promotion and there is nothing he could do about that.
314,12,71,4Kd2,b'8/1r5k/8/8/p7/1p6/3Kp3/8 b - -',He plays Kd2 hoping that I will not get the promotion.
315,12,72,4Re7,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/1p6/3Kp3/8 w - -',I respond with Re7 to protect my pawn on e2.
316,12,73,5Ke1,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/1p6/4p3/4K3 b - -',He now plays Ke1 in his last minute attempt to stop the promotion but that does not work. 
317,12,74,5b2,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/8/1p2p3/4K3 w - -',I respond with b2 so there is nothing he could do to stop the promotion in this position because it is now inevitable. 
318,12,75,5Kd2,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/8/1p1Kp3/8 b - -',His only choices are now Kf2 or Kd2 because he cannot move his king anywhere else.
319,12,76,5b1=Q,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/8/3Kp3/1q6 w - -',I just got a pawn promotion here.
320,12,77,5Kc3,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/2K5/4p3/1q6 b - -',In this position his only choice was Kc3 because he could not move anywhere else since my rook is on e7 and my promoted queen is on b1.
321,12,78,5e1=Q+,b'8/4r2k/8/8/p7/2K5/8/1q2q3 w - -',At this point I got another pawn promotion with and I directly checked him with it.
322,12,79,a3,b'8/4r2k/8/8/2K5/p7/8/1q2q3 w - -',At this point I was thinking about promoting yet another pawn which is why I played a3 but I quickly realized that I could mate him without a third promotion.  In addition a third pawn might directly lead to a stalemate because the king might only be safe in the same spot but nowhere else.  Therefore I do not bother with a2 followed by a1=Q.  
323,12,80,5Kc5,b'8/4r2k/8/2K5/8/p7/8/1q2q3 b - -',Because he is nervous he pulls his king back with Kc5 as opposed to Kd4 but that is not a problem either.
324,12,81,5Qbb4+,b'8/4r2k/8/2K5/1q6/p7/8/4q3 w - -',At this point I find a forced mating pattern so I check him with Qbb4+ and force him to play Kd5.
325,12,82,Qe5+,b'8/4r2k/8/3Kq3/1q6/p7/8/8 w - -',Now I check him again with Qe5+ and force him to play Kc6.
326,12,83,5Kc6,b'8/4r2k/2K5/4q3/1q6/p7/8/8 b - -',Now I have him just where I want him.
327,12,84,5Qbd6#,b'8/4r2k/2Kq4/4q3/8/p7/8/8 w - -',That is because I culminate him into and force a checkmate with Qbd6#.  I learned something interesting in this game because it was contrary to my game against amnita.  I learned that one game could make a person play better in the next game.  That is because one game is supposed to be a learning experience even it is rated and not a coaching game.  Until this game I thought that it required a coaching game or a series of bad games to learn from previous mistakes.
328,13,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',When playing as White I never play English Opening because White is less active than it could be. So far I have had some pretty good winning chances playing against White's English Opening.
329,13,1,1Rfe1,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P3b1/1QNPBNP1/PP2PPBP/R3R1K1 b - -',Incorrect. The e-pawn is still at the base position and the dark-squared bishop completely buries the pawn making Rfe1 a bad move.
330,13,2,1Bh5,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p2b/2P5/1QNPBNP1/PP2PPBP/R3R1K1 w - -',I don't like the dark-squared bishop eyeing on the a7-g1 diagonal because I want to place my knight on c5 which chases the queen away and allows easy access to the active e6 square.
331,13,3,Ng4,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp4/4p2b/2P3n1/1QNPBNP1/PP2PPBP/3RR1K1 w - -',Removing the bishop or forcing it to occupy a more passive square.
332,13,4,1a3,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp4/4p2b/2P3n1/PQNPBNP1/1P2PPBP/3RR1K1 b - -',Totally disregarding my plan.
333,13,5,1Nxe3,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp4/4p2b/2P5/PQNPnNP1/1P2PPBP/3RR1K1 w - -',Happily trading it. Now white's e2 is seriously buried and Re1 looks like a joke! 
334,13,6,1fxe3,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp4/4p2b/2P5/PQNPPNP1/1P2P1BP/3RR1K1 b - -',Look closely the e3 cannot be defended and if it is moved to e4 it would block Ne4 and the fianchettoed bishop's access to the long diagonal.
335,13,7,1Nc5,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2pp4/2n1p2b/2P5/PQNPPNP1/1P2P1BP/3RR1K1 w - -',Appears to be kicking the queen away but all I wanted to do was to maneuver the knight. Doing it without losing a tempo!
336,13,8,Bg6,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2pp2b1/2n1p3/2P5/P1NPPNP1/1PQ1P1BP/3RR1K1 w - -',Stopping white's idea of advancing d4 which would force me to trade pawns to dissolve his double pawns. Of course I want to maintain my spatial advantage.
337,13,9,1Qc1,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2pp2b1/2n1p3/2P5/P1NPPNP1/1P2P1BP/2QRR1K1 b - -',Moving his queen away to prepare d4.

339,13,11,1d4,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2ppn1b1/4p3/2PP4/P1N1PNP1/1P2P1BP/2QRR1K1 b - -',No longer a good move because my knight is not on c5.

341,13,13,f5,b'r4rk1/ppq1b1pp/2ppn1b1/5p2/2PPp3/P1N1P1P1/1P1NP1BP/2QRR1K1 w - f6',The only good way to protect the advanced pawn.

343,13,15,1Ref1,b'r4rk1/ppq1b1pp/2pp2b1/2nP1p2/2P1p3/P1N1P1P1/1P1NP1BP/2QR1RK1 b - -',Finally realizing the passivity of that rook. A better move would have been g4 to immediately undermine my e4-f5 pawns. Perhaps he is concerned about giving his king too much air.

889,34,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This was the move that I was referring to 2. Nc3.  Instead I did on my third move for the exact same reason with Bc4 and then castling.
890,34,4,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now she decides to play the Sicilian defense.  In the mean time I bring out my knights so that I am protected.
891,34,5,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I brought out my bishop so that I could castle on my next move but I was unaware that this would be a bad time to castle.  I also realize that Bc4 was a bad move because she could have played a fork against me between my pawn on e4 and my bishop on c4.  Luckily she does not do this but instead she plays Nc6.
892,34,6,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',As I mentioned earlier this was a bad to castle.  I should have played Ng5 because she is going to bring out her bishop on her next move and threaten my knight with Bxf3.
893,34,7,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Not only does she play Bg4 and threaten with Bxf3 but I am now pinned.  That is I cannot pull my knight away with Ng5 or I am going to loose my queen because she is going to play Bxd1.
894,34,8,Bb5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',"On the other hand I play Bb5 because I am thinking ""Two could play that game"".  That is because I decided to pin her in return with Bb5. "

896,34,10,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2Bp1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now she makes a big mistake that allows me to get a free bishop and check her.
897,34,11,Bxd7+,b'r2qkb1r/pp1B1ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Now she lost a pawn and is checked after I play Bxd7+ and I am just getting started. 
898,34,12,Qxd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1q1ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Even though she captures my bishop with Qxd7 I still have a few surprises for her.
899,34,13,Nd5,b'r3kb1r/pp1q1ppp/3p1n2/2pNp3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I try to force an exchange with her with Nxd5 and exd5 by playing Nd5 but that plan also does not work.  
900,34,14,Ng4,b'r3kb1r/pp1q1ppp/3p4/2pNp3/4P1n1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Instead she moves her knight away from danger with Ng4.

This move did not make a lot of sense.  I wanted to bring out my bishop and form a Fianchetto because I would not be able to capture free pieces or exchange them in this position.
902,34,16,1Qe6,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3pq3/2pNp3/4P1n1/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I do not understand why she played Qe6 because I ask myself the following.  What piece is she threatening?  I am looking at the entire board and the queen does not seem like a threat at the moment.
903,34,17,1Nc7+,b'r3kb1r/ppN2ppp/3pq3/2p1p3/4P1n1/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',At this point I decide to play a 3 way fork against her in order to capture her queen since she is checked.

906,34,20,1h5,b'r4b1r/pp2k1p1/3pp3/2p1p2p/4P1n1/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - h6',I am not sure why she played h5 but I believe that she did it to either capture a free a pawn or get a pass pawn.

910,34,24,1g3,b'r4b1r/pp2k3/3ppnp1/2p1p3/4P2p/1P3NPP/PBPPQP2/3R1RK1 b - -',I forced an exchange with this move because I generally like to exchange pieces.
911,34,25,Rxh3,b'r4b2/pp2k3/3ppnp1/2p1p3/4P3/1P3NPr/PBPPQ3/3R1RK1 w - -',However this was not a good exchange because it was not even.  At the point I did not realize that I supposed to count pieces.  This is something that Jack Stockel taught me about 5 weeks ago.  Because I did not count the pieces she was able to get an extra pawn during the exchange.
912,34,26,1Kg2,b'r4b2/pp2k3/3ppnp1/2p1p3/4P3/1P3NPr/PBPPQ1K1/3R1R2 b - -',In this position her rook is now threatened with Kxh3 so she is now forced to pull her rook back.

914,34,28,2Bh6,b'r7/pp2k3/3ppnpb/2p1p2r/4P3/1P3NP1/PBPPQ1K1/3R3R w - -',Instead she brings her bishop.  I believe that it is because she was trying to trick me but I was not going to be fooled.
915,34,29,2Rxh5,b'r7/pp2k3/3ppnpb/2p1p2R/4P3/1P3NP1/PBPPQ1K1/3R4 b - -',I still force the exchange.
916,34,30,2Kh2,b'r7/pp2k3/3pp1pb/2p1p2n/4P3/1P3NP1/PBPPQ2K/3R4 b - -',I played Kh2 in order to put pressure on her knight.  
917,34,31,2Rh8,b'7r/pp2k3/3pp1pb/2p1p2n/4P3/1P3NP1/PBPPQ2K/3R4 w - -',On the other hand she played Rh8 in to put pressure on the h square.
918,34,32,2Qf2,b'7r/pp2k3/3pp1pb/2p1p2n/4P3/1P3NP1/PBPP1Q1K/3R4 b - -',I played Qf2 to put pressure on her.

920,34,34,2Ba3,b'7r/pp2k3/3pp2b/2p1p1p1/4PnP1/BP3N2/P1PP1Q1K/3R4 b - -',I do not want know why I made this move but it was not strategically smart because it will trigger a negative chain of events.
921,34,35,2Bg7+,b'7r/pp2k1b1/3pp3/2p1p1p1/4PnP1/BP3N2/P1PP1Q1K/3R4 w - -',At this points she plays a discover check against me by moving her bishop away from her rook.

923,34,37,2Nh3+,b'7r/pp2k1b1/3pp3/2p1p1p1/4P1P1/BP3N1n/P1PP1Q2/3R2K1 w - -',Now she checks and plays a fork against so she is going to capture my queen for her knight with Nxf2.
924,34,38,Rf8,b'5r2/pp2k1b1/3pp3/2p1p1p1/4P1P1/BP3N2/P1PP1K2/3R4 w - -',Again she plays Rf8 in order to put pressure on the f square.

928,34,42,3Rc8,b'2r5/pp2k3/3pp2b/2p1p1p1/1P2P1P1/B4NK1/P1PP4/3R4 w - -',Instead she pressures the c square with her rook.
929,34,43,3Rh1,b'2r5/pp2k3/3pp2b/2p1p1p1/1P2P1P1/B4NK1/P1PP4/7R b - -',I respond with Rh1 so that I could threaten her bishop with Rxh6.

931,34,45,3bxc5,b'7r/pp2k3/3pp2b/2P1p1p1/4P1P1/B4NK1/P1PP4/7R b - -',Instead I force an exchange with her with bxc5.
932,34,46,3dxc5,b'7r/pp2k3/4p2b/2p1p1p1/4P1P1/B4NK1/P1PP4/7R w - -',This exchange works because I am able to capture an extra but this capture is a free pawn that leads to a direct check with Bxc5+.
933,34,47,3Bxc5+,b'7r/pp2k3/4p2b/2B1p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/7R b - -',Now that she is checked what happens after she gets out of it?  That will be answered on my next move. 
934,34,48,3Bxa7,b'7r/Bp6/4pk1b/4p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/7R b - -',I simply capture a free pawn after she recovers with Bxa7.
935,34,49,3Bg7,b'7r/Bp4b1/4pk2/4p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/7R w - -',I do not know why she picked this candidate.
936,34,50,3Bc5,b'7r/1p4b1/4pk2/2B1p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/7R b - -',This was not a good move.
937,34,51,3Rd8,b'3r4/1p4b1/4pk2/2B1p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/7R w - -',That is because she could have captured my free rook with rxh1.  It was just lucky that she did not play rxh1. Now instead she threatens me with Rxd2 by playing Rd8. 
938,34,52,3Rd1,b'3r4/1p4b1/4pk2/2B1p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/3R4 b - -',Instead I handle this situation with Rd1 but it is bad move.
939,34,53,3Rc8,b'2r5/1p4b1/4pk2/2B1p1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1PP4/3R4 w - -',That is because she threatens to capture my free bishop with Rxc5.

941,34,55,3Bxe5+,b'8/1p4b1/4pk2/4B1p1/4P1P1/5NK1/P1rP4/3R4 b - -',This check forced her to exchange her bishop and I got a free pawn after that.

946,34,60,4g5,b'8/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P3/6K1/r2P4/3R4 b - -',In my attempt to get a pawn promotion I play g5 as my candidate.

949,34,63,4Rg8,b'6r1/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P3/6K1/3P4/1R6 w - -',She plays Rg8 because wants to get a free pawn.
950,34,64,4Kg4,b'6r1/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P1K1/8/3P4/1R6 b - -',I respond and protect the pawn by playing Kg4.
951,34,65,4Rf8,b'5r2/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P1K1/8/3P4/1R6 w - -',She threatens to check me with Rf4+.  If she had been able to check me she would have gotten a free pawn with Rxe4.
952,34,66,4Kh5,b'5r2/1N2k3/8/4p1PK/4P3/8/3P4/1R6 b - -',I responded to that threat with Kh5.
953,34,67,4Rh8+,b'7r/1N2k3/8/4p1PK/4P3/8/3P4/1R6 w - -',Now she checks me but I do not care because this check is only a nuisance.
954,34,68,Rg8,b'6r1/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P1K1/8/3P4/1R6 w - -',I do not know why she made this move for she knows that she cannot play Rxg5.
955,34,69,4Rd1,b'6r1/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/4P1K1/8/3P4/3R4 b - -',I also do not know why I chose that candidate in this position because she is not threatening to play Rxd2 at the moment.

958,34,72,5Rf4+,b'8/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/3PPrK1/8/8/3R4 w - -',Now she puts me in a serious check as part of the fork.  That's right she is playing a fork against me between my king on g4 and my pawn on e4.  
959,34,73,Rxe4,b'8/1N2k3/8/4p1P1/3Pr3/6K1/8/3R4 w - -',After I come out of check she gets a free pawn with Rxe4.

965,34,79,5d3,b'5k2/1N6/3P2P1/8/8/3p2K1/8/8 w - -',While I try to get a pawn promotion she also tries for the same thing so she plays d3.
966,34,80,5d7,b'5k2/1N1P4/6P1/8/8/3p2K1/8/8 b - -',Because I played d7 I am only one step away from promoting my pawn into a queen. 
967,34,81,5Ke7,b'8/1N1Pk3/6P1/8/8/3p2K1/8/8 w - -',She attempts to prevent the promotion by playing Ke7 and is successful 
968,34,82,5Nc5,b'8/3Pk3/6P1/2N5/8/3p2K1/8/8 b - -'," This was my biggest mistake because I underestimated the power of her king.  That is because I inferred that it did not matter what she did with her king since I was in the winning position and going to win anyway.  My best move would have been g7.  That way I would have gotten a pawn promotion and she would not be able to it from happening.  If I had played g7 and she had played Kf7 to stop the promotion I would have responded with d8=Q and the promotion would have been inevitable.  Instead I played Nc5 because I believed that this would prevent her from playing Kxg7 and inhibit her pawn promotion but I was wrong.  Jack Stockel would say ""That losses immediately"" with this move.   "
969,34,83,5d2,b'8/3Pk3/6P1/2N5/8/6K1/3p4/8 w - -',Because she played d2 and my king was not on e2 d1 d3 or c2 she was going to get a pawn promotion and I would not be able to stop it.  In addition I cannot my pawn with d8=Q because he would simply capture the promoted queen with Kxd8.

973,34,87,Qxc5+,b'8/3Pk3/8/2q2K2/8/8/8/8 w - -',"This was a very good game.  In fact this was my second best loss and one of my longest games but there is and was an important lesson to learn from this game.  In the short term this game taught me not to underestimate the opponent during pawn promotions.  In the long term I learned an important fact about end games from Jack Stockel and it reminds me of this game against anitam.  It also explains how I became overconfident with anitam during the end game.  That is because he played against an opponent about two weeks ago and the opponent was winning.  In fact he almost won the game but he made some serious mistakes and lost the game because of his overconfidence.  The lesson was ""When you think that you have won or you are winning be very careful and do not underestimate the opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and loosing the game."" "
