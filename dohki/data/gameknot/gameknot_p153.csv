0,0,0,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',As I think the King's Gambit was a popular opening during the 19th century.
1,0,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',If I played I prefer 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Bc4 because it avoids the annoying 3...Qh4+.
2,0,2,b5,b'rnb1kbnr/p1pp1ppp/8/1p6/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq b6',What was that? I think that Kieseritsky tried to activate the light squared bishop on a6-f1 diagonal by some moves later where the white King was.
3,0,3,Bxb5,b'rnb1kbnr/p1pp1ppp/8/1B6/4Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq -',As I think 5.Nf3 followed by 6.Bb3 and 7.d3 (or d4 if possible) will give white a better control over the center. On the other hand it was recapturing the pawn he offered in the second move.
4,0,4,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1B6/4Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq -',Getting the control over the center is very important while it was attacking the pawn on e4.
5,0,5,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1B6/4Pp1q/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',Developing a horse while attacking to the Queen but 3.Nf3 is better according to me.
6,0,6,Nh5,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',Black was trying to a breakthrough with 8...Ng3+. According to my opinion it is better not to move the same piece in the opening moves I like 7...c6 here.
7,0,7,Qg5,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/8/1B4qn/4Pp1N/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',The queen was threatening to both the bishop and the horse. 9.Nf5 would stop that for a while.
8,0,8,Nf5,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/8/1B3Nqn/4Pp2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',It was the only way to protect both pieces.
9,0,9,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p5/1B3Nqn/4Pp2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',Trying to create some space for the light squared bishop as well as a pawn moves towards the center.
10,0,10,1g4,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p5/1B3Nqn/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1K1R b kq g3',An aggressive counterattack! Black could easily cut the bishop and there will be a huge blank squares around the white king. Because the king has been moved it would be not difficult to launch an attack from the kingside.
11,0,11,1Rg1,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/1B3Nq1/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1KR1 b kq -',Anderssen was ignoring the piece and trying to attack the queen.
12,0,12,1h4,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/5n2/1p3Nq1/4PpPP/3P4/PPP5/RNBQ1KR1 b kq h3',12...Qg6 is forced.
13,0,13,1h5,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/5nq1/1p3N1P/4PpP1/3P4/PPP5/RNBQ1KR1 b kq -',Again he was forcing 13.Qg5.
14,0,14,Ng8,b'rnb1kbnr/p2p1ppp/8/1p3NqP/4PpP1/3P1Q2/PPP5/RNB2KR1 w kq -',He had to move the horse otherwise the Queen is trapped with 15.Bxf4. It had no better place than its home square.
15,0,15,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1p3N1P/4PBP1/3P1Q2/PPP5/RN3KR1 w kq -',Black was threatening 16.Qxb2 followed by capturing the trapped rook.
16,0,16,1Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1p3N1P/4PBP1/2NP1Q2/PPP5/R4KR1 b kq -',It stopped the threat but 16...b4 would force to move the same knight again.
17,0,17,1Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1pb2N1P/4PBP1/2NP1Q2/PPP5/R4KR1 w kq -',It was taking the control over the a7-g1 diagonal while attacking to the rook on g1.
18,0,18,1Nd5,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1pbN1N1P/4PBP1/3P1Q2/PPP5/R4KR1 b kq -',He was giving up both the pawn and the rook but can you see how smoothly the white pieces come towards the black king? 
19,0,19,Qxa1+,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/3B4/1pbN1N1P/4P1P1/3P1Q2/P1P5/q4KR1 w kq -',By this move anyone can obviously see that black was becoming very greedy to obtain the rooks without offering anything.
20,0,20,Bxg1,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/3B4/1p1N1N1P/4P1P1/3P1Q2/P1P1K3/q5b1 w kq -',19...Qxg1 would not be as vulnerable as 19...Bxg1 as I see because Bc5 was exerting pressure on Bd6.
21,0,21,Na6,b'r1b1k1nr/p2p1ppp/n2B4/1p1NPN1P/6P1/3P1Q2/P1P1K3/q5b1 w kq -',I would not like that move because white would do 20.Nc7+ if only he was badly needing the rook. And it was a blunder and a mate in 3 for white. Can you locate it?
22,0,22,Kd8,b'r1bk2nr/p2p1pNp/n2B4/1p1NP2P/6P1/3P1Q2/P1P1K3/q5b1 w - -',There was no other possible moves.

24,0,24,2Nxf6,b'r1bk3r/p2p1pNp/n2B1n2/1p1NP2P/6P1/3P4/P1P1K3/q5b1 w - -',Willingly or not black had to capture it or to put 22.Ne7. Both are a mate in next move.
25,0,25,2Be7#,b'r1bk3r/p2pBpNp/n4n2/1p1NP2P/6P1/3P4/P1P1K3/q5b1 b - -',Though White was 21 points down the game was ended in favor of White.
26,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',An opening i'm not using anymore as my personal database shows a % of win higher for black.
27,1,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Ruy Lopez opening was one of my favorite when the game was played. The White Bishop gets there to volunteerily get harassed by a6-b5 pawns and be re-routed on a better square (a4-b3-c2) which weakens slightly the black queenside and create holes for a counter-punch on a-file or get the center with maneuvers like c3-d4. 
28,1,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Classical defense to exert pressure on e4 as 4.Bxc6 5. Nxe5 is countered easily by Qd4 and gives back the pawn on tempo. 
29,1,3,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"Clearly planned the c3-d4 setup but its not a good time to play it. Black could play now 4...Nxe4 without being too much harassed with my pieces as the further retreat 5...Nd6 forces white to remove the Bishop or exchange it.

Better 4.0-0 to pursue the development of pieces and make it a trap on e4 for black. "
30,1,4,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"Looks like a good development move but in fact this move gives back the edge to white. As white had previously shown their intent of d4 with the preparation move c3 it appear obvious the black bishop will be kicked of his square and that Bb6 or Bb4 still allows white a good control of the center via d4-e4 pawns. 

4...Be7 is more solid as it prevents potential pin on f6 and he won't be thrown away on squares his activity is almost useless."
31,1,5,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Natural development move.

33,1,7,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - d3',"The idea 6.Bxc6 7.Nxe5 isnt good as e-pawns will be exchanged and open the position for black who has an advantage of development (3 minor pieces vs 2 that's the price to pay for the earlier c3 move)

This move claims the center as explained before."
34,1,8,exd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb5/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',"I think this move was made automatically as it makes good sense to release pressure but also allows me a good center. 

Although i think the retreat 6...Bb6 is better as 7.d5 is meeted by 7...Ne7 and forces white to defend the e4 pawn and get an advantage of space that black could counter sooner or later by trying to destroy the pawn chain d5-e4.

7.dxe5 isnt any better as one of the e-pawns will fall after knight capture and the other one will be isolated on the e-file which makes it tough to defend and needs all white resource to keep it.
"
35,1,9,Bb6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/1B6/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',The best move i guess.
36,1,10,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Here a risky plan: Kick out the knight from d5 so i can push my pawns on the 5th row and create an outpost on the potentially weak d6 square. Alternate 8.Nc3 or 8.d5 are also possible.
37,1,11,Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/1B1nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',8...Ne4 is a better outpost as an eventual d5 can be met by Nxf2 and force the Exchange on f2. 
38,1,12,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Black is struggled in his pieces placement and white will try anything to achieve it.
39,1,13,Nde7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',9...Nce7 is better because it doesnt allow 10.d5 to white and achieve their goal of getting d-e pawns on 5th row.
40,1,14,1Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P1B1/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',"A clear blunder. White's plan is to pin the knight so an eventual d5-d6 pawn advance will allow him at best a good outpost. Fact is: 10....d5 kills completely white's play and after 11.exd6 spatial advantage is almost gone.

Better is 10.d5 Na5 11.Bd3 to keep the center without being countered and accept the loss of a tempo by Bishop retreat."
41,1,15,1Qe8,b'r1b1qrk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P1B1/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Probably the fear of the pin makes opponent missing ...d5. I won't do same mistake twice.
42,1,16,Nd8,b'r1bnqrk1/ppppnppp/1b6/3PP1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',"More active is 11...Na5 to gain tempo on the bishop. 

When pieces are struggled like this and that you haven't a target big enough to claim a clear victory develop your pieces actively and wait to complete the development befpre attacking as weak pieces will stay weak for a while and a too quick counter-punch can backfire to you as you opened squares to achieve it."
43,1,17,1d6,b'r1bnqrk1/ppppnppp/1b1P4/4P1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Achieved plan since Bg5: Outpost on d6. Alternate 12.Nc3 or Re1 are still possible.
44,1,18,1cxd6,b'r1bnqrk1/pp1pnppp/1b1p4/4P1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',"Maybe it was the best common sense move but I dont like it as it allows a definitive outpost at d6 for the pawn. Maybe they traded for materialistic reasons but 13.dxc7 gains a pawn but the outpost is lost and far more important than the gain of c7 as it paralyzes black activity for a while. 

I think 12...Nec6 or Ng6 is better. Maybe."
45,1,19,Nf5,b'r1bnqrk1/pp1p1ppp/1b1P4/5nB1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',This knight has no future except targeting a pawn already protected. I still maintain 13.Nec6 or Ng6 idea.

The idea is to advance a pawn and develop white bishop which i think is a wrong idea as it's slow and that being struggled requires more energetic measures to avoid a slump.
52,1,26,1Nc3,b'r1b1qrk1/pp1pBppp/3Pn2n/2b5/2B5/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Achieved development.

The thing is my pieces are drifting away from the king-side and I am not thinking of aggressive resources of my opponent at all. I think this move is already a bit unconventional.

The opening is sometimes considered reckless as most attacking chances are because an oppenent doesn't know the opening and falls into one of its many traps.

Black's Rook is hemmed in and his Knight is badly placed.  The Bishop pair isn't enough compensation for Black's postion and material disadvantage.
340,16,6,1c4,b'3n1rk1/p1p2ppp/2b5/2bNP3/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B3K1 b - c3',I challange him to give up the Bishop pair but he decides not to.

551,23,5,1Bxe5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pB3/3P4/4P2P/PPP1NPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',11. Bxe5 - I got rid of white's knight on e5.  Although it is replaced by white's dsb I am more than happy to trade off Fou Lenoir for it.
552,23,6,1dxe5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/8/3QP2P/PPP1NPP1/R4RK1 b - -',13. dxe5 - and I do.  Although a white pawn now occupies e5 it is doubled.  At least white does not have his lsb so it may not be quite so easy for white to mount an attack on h7.

Ah but this is a space clearance for my knight.   White should start feeling very cold soon and you will soon see why.

562,23,16,3a6,b'6k1/2N2ppp/P3p3/2npP3/2p2P2/4P2P/6rr/R3RK2 b - -',30. a6 - he still pushes on that pawn but the square e4 is undefended and my steed now lands on it.  White should have played Nb5 here.  He will now cop Old Matey.

If black ever does manage to gain an attack then the extra centre pawn will allow white to liquify at his discretion and potentially punish any over extension.
612,26,5,Nh5,b'r2q1rk1/pQpnbppp/3p3B/4p2n/2B1P3/2PP1P2/PP3P1P/RN2K1R1 w Q -',Black's pieces look very discoordianted at this point. The knight may prove useful on h5 with pressure over f4 but aside from that the bishop is very restricted and the queen isn't doing anything.
613,26,6,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/pQpnbppp/3p3B/4p2n/1PB1P3/2PP1P2/P4P1P/RN2K1R1 b Q b3',Taking over c5 to prevent the d7 knight from hoping into there. The queen can still retreat to a6 and a4 if the rook moves to b8 
614,26,7,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pQpnbppp/3p3B/4p2n/1PB1P3/2PP1P2/P4P1P/RN2K1R1 w Q -',The thinking behind move is quite good as it simply improves Black's position a little bit. The pin is removed and c6 d5 ideas come into play where White's king could potentially get caught out and the light-squared bishop will prove to be misplaced. 
615,26,8,1Qd5,b'r2qr1k1/p1pnbppp/3p3B/3Qp2n/1PB1P3/2PP1P2/P4P1P/RN2K1R1 b Q -',Sadly this move shows up Re8 somewhat. The rook is forced back and although the queen doesn't particularly want to be on d5 it isn't much worse than b7.

I felt that Black should play c6 at this point though after 0-0-0 d5 Bb3 White will have chances to fight back for the centre with an eventual Re1 whilst Black will struggle to progress. 
617,26,10,1Bc6,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/1nBp3B/Q3p2n/1P2P3/2PP1P2/P2N1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',Preventing any central gains by Black

The condensed nature of the position is making it difficult for White's extra pawn so far to have meaningful sway but creating a passed pawn on the wing gives White a simple plan of queenside expansion that makes improving the position much easier than before. 
619,26,12,1Qa3,b'1r1q1rk1/2p2ppp/1nBp1b1B/4p2n/1P2P3/Q1PP1P2/P2N1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',With the idea of Qb3 and pushing the a-pawn

The queenside files are secured and now one would expect the extra piece to win the game easily. After Kd1 this may be the case as Nf4 can be met Kc2 and the rook can get involved. Sadly though White has a spell of weak moves from this point onwards. 
630,26,23,3Ke2,b'1r6/1q3pkp/3p2p1/2p1p2n/2P1P3/1B1P1P2/Q2NKP1P/6R1 b - -',With the same idea of getting the rook involved but pathetically missing that when on f4 the knight would have g2 to check the king from.

So I just played any random move I saw without much thought.  And as it turns out it's probably the greatest game I've ever played.  There's nothing to be proud of by winning over a lower rated opponent but what makes this game amazing is the moves that were played.  
According to computer analysis my opponent played a ""perfect"" game and I was the only one to make a ""mistake"".  And yet I still won.          

I know using computer engine analysis afterward to help analyze this game is kind of cheap but if you were to seriously look at the position after 17. Nxg5 and try to analyze it yourself (and figure out the forced win) the position is so complex your mind will blow.  Personally I spent at least 6 hours just playing the game from move 21 to the end and afterward I spent 2-3 hours analyzing it before I gave up amid the complexities and used a computer engine.  And what I found was shocking.  I played the computer from move 17 onwards and eventually (with take-backs) won several times and after every variation it would take the computer a long time before it figured out that it was black was in fact losing. Eventually the computer was still refusing to say that 17. Nxg5 was winning for white and at best said it was a draw.  I seriously hope it wins but may still be a draw and such complexity is beyond my comprehension."

As it turns out it deserves an exclamation mark for the pressure it puts on black and is eventually a very important pawn in allowing 17. Nxg5 to win.  If Bxe5 then 14. dxe6 generating pressure on black's king.  (14. ... fxe6 Qxe6+ wins a bishop)

Of course the side effect was the opening of the e file.  That was because after a few minutes' thinking I couldn't come up with anything better. (I thought about f4 but I didn't believe it would do anything useful. I like to keep my king hidden.) Instead this is what happened:

 I highly doubt any computer whether it's Rybka or Fritz would ever play this because it clearly looks as though white hasn't much to attack/threaten with and black has a solid defense."

Not sure if there's a move the computer missed that wins as in the case of the Rh8 move the winning moves which I found by myself (my computer couldn't find it even after hours of searching).
But a possible continuation without drawing: 24. Rf4 Rh8 25. h4! Re8 26. Too many possibilities and complications to analyze. But if 24. Rf4 c6! I think black might survive and draw. (but not conclusively sure)
Heres one: 24. Re5 and I haven't quite had enough time to analyze this neither has the computer (the computer still says black is slightly better); I found a draw through this that I forgot the sequence but I'm not sure if it's possible to win through this.

It has been quite a while since I have annotated any games.  I have increased my games workload quite a bit and quite a few of those have been against Masters and Experts and some Class C Players who are giving me some tough games at the moment.  I did manage to win both my games over Lallit (who is ezyaz) - he played better with the black pieces than with the white.  Just like my other Class D buddy The Dentist aka Tofuman Lallit's optimum rating has once been in the 1400s so he can be a Dark Horse at times as my Class B Buddy NN found out.  Buddy NN now plays the Master Mater's favourite response to 1. e4 which is Nf6 which is the Alekhine's Defense."

816,33,5,Nxc3,b'r4rk1/1b1n1ppp/ppq1p3/3p4/P2Q4/1Pn1PNP1/2P2PBP/R3R1K1 w - -',See ! White side lose a piece.

818,33,7,2bxc4,b'1r2qrk1/1b3ppp/pp2pn2/4Q3/P1P1P3/6P1/5PBP/2RR2K1 b - -',Black side is moving nicely and trying to get more pieces and it seems it is working.
819,33,8,2Qxa4,b'1r3rk1/1b3ppp/pp2pn2/4Q3/q1P1P3/6P1/5PBP/2RR2K1 w - -',See ! got another Pawn.
820,33,9,2Rd4,b'1r3rk1/1b3ppp/pp2pn2/4Q3/q1PRP3/6P1/5PBP/2R3K1 b - -',Looks like White Rook is trying a discover  attack !

822,33,11,2Rxd8+,b'1r1R2k1/1b3ppp/pp2pn2/4Q3/q1P1P3/6P1/5PBP/2R3K1 b - -',White side thinks no option other than cutting Black Rook. May be he could double the Rooks.
823,33,12,3c6,b'3r2k1/3q1ppp/pQP1pn2/8/8/6P1/5PbP/2R3K1 b - -',Here White made mistake without getting rid of the Bishop Pawn got pushed and Bishop can remove that Pawn !  
824,33,13,3Rg5,b'q2r2k1/5ppp/pQ2p3/6R1/8/6P1/3n1P1P/6K1 b - -',That's a mistake. He had abandoned the Rook with the Knight to f3.   
825,33,14,3Qe3,b'q2r2k1/5ppp/p3p3/6n1/8/4Q1P1/5P1P/5K2 b - -',Now it is a mating two. Can you guess the way of doing it?
826,33,15,Qd1#,b'3r2k1/5ppp/p3p3/6n1/8/4Q1P1/4KP1P/3q4 w - -',It is done. Black is victorious here ! 
827,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So we are all familiar with 1...c5 the Sicilian Defense. I use the Sicilian reguarly or at least since my coach hammered it into me. I used to play 1...e5. My coach a 2nd catagory player rated in the high 1900's taught me the Sicilian. He said the only way to beat it was to learn it. At that time I had been having a losing streak against the Sicilian.
828,34,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"Right here I go into my own personal variation of the Sicilian which I call ""The Fabian French"". I haven't played it in any real matchs only in fun ones. Super Ninja is a personal friend of mine so we were joking around with this game. If this is a real opening can someone please notify me of it? Please and thank you."
829,34,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',He continues with his original plan the Grand Prix Attack. This move was taught to me by my coach and I taught it to Ninja.
830,34,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',So here is where the opening derives its name. It is a hybrid of the Sicilian and the French. White couldn't start off with 2. d5 because of the 1... c5 so he doesn't have his perfect center.
831,34,4,exd5,b'rn2kb1r/p2b1ppp/8/1pppP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/R1BNK1NR w KQkq -',Now Black has a better center than White but not by much.  He's solved the problem of the French Bishop.
832,34,5,d4,b'rn2kb1r/p2b2pp/5p2/2p1P3/2Pp1P2/8/P5PP/R1BNK1NR w KQkq -',A much better move than accepting the pawn sacrifice.

834,34,7,Re8,b'2k1r3/p6p/6p1/2N1b3/2Pp4/5P2/P6P/4R1K1 w - -',Now the pressure is on my Bishop rather than his pawn.
835,34,8,2Nf6,b'4r3/7p/2k2Np1/p3b3/2Pp4/5P2/P6P/4R1K1 b - -',A blunder.

854,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game was played when I was rated 1486 and panditanuj was rated 1626. The game was for panditanuj's mini-tournament and shows how after a strange oppening White was able to get ahead and win.
855,36,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',So he tries The Center Counter but after playing 1...e5 first. I thought it was a bit peculiar but it was a pretty good opening.
856,36,2,Qe2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/4p3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Now the pawn is pinned to the king and can't take the Knight.
857,36,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/4p3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',I think 4...Qxd5 would have been stronger.
858,36,4,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/4p3/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',5. Nc3 would have easily won this however I missed it.
