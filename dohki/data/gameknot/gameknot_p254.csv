At first I thought that Black simply didn't pay attention to my bishop on c1 but then I saw that maybe Black was taking a shot at opening the h column for its rook creating a potentially nasty discovered check having the bishop on h2. I will never know which of the two were Black's motivation but Black's apparent ""queen sacrifice"" will prove to be not so sound."
42,1,15,1Bxg5,b'2kr3r/pppn1pp1/4b1Bp/3p1NB1/3P2n1/2P5/PP2QPPb/RN2R2K b - -',I quickly grabbed Black's queen with the assurance that I would also get Black's knight and knowing that Black's discovered check wouldn't force a quick mate.

44,1,17,1Nf6,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4bnB1/3p1Np1/3P2Q1/2P5/PP3PPb/RN2R2K w - -',Tricky move if you try to blitz it (as I almost did). If White takes on g5 Black now has a profitable discovered check by attacking the queen with the bishop.

48,1,21,1Reg8,b'2k3rr/ppp2pN1/4bnB1/3p2p1/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPb/RN2R2K w - -',The threat of a potential doubling of the black rooks on the h column seems now to complicate things for White.
49,1,22,1Bf5,b'2k3rr/ppp2pN1/4bn2/3p1Bp1/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPb/RN2R2K b - -',After analyzing this move for some time days after the game I'm not so sure if this was better than 18.Nf5 or 18.Nxe6. Honestly I need to look deeply at all the ramifications.
50,1,23,Ne4,b'2k3rr/ppp2p2/8/3p1Np1/3Pn3/2P5/PP2QPPb/RN2R2K w - -',?? This move totally ignores the fork on e7 which destroys the possibility of a rook-doubling on h.

59,2,7,1a4,b'r3k2r/pp1bnppp/4p3/2bpP3/P2q4/3B3P/1P2QPP1/RNB2RK1 b kq a3',To support a later Bb5 without allowing Bxb5 Qxb5 Qxe5. White's plan is questionable as the original idea of the Milner-Barry Gambit is to allow White's light-squared bishop to reach its best square while Black's LSB is trapped behind its own pawn chain (as often happens in the French).
60,2,8,1Rd1,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/P2q4/3B3P/1P2QPP1/RNBR2K1 b kq -',Another poor move failing to defend e5.
61,2,9,1Qxe5,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/2bpq3/P7/3B3P/1P2QPP1/RNBR2K1 w kq -',After the knight capture White has Bxh7 chipping a hole in the Black king's intended refuge.
62,2,10,1Bb5,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1Bbpn3/P7/7P/1P3PP1/RNBR2K1 b kq -',As planned. But now that queens are off this move seems even worse than it did before because White is simply entering a poor endgame in which Black has two pawns and the compensation. (Who was it who made that quip?)
63,2,11,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/1Pbpn3/8/7P/1P3PP1/RNBR2K1 w - -',Black could have considered 16... Kd7; it isn't quite an endgame yet but White has little chance of an attack especially considering his poor development.
64,2,12,Rae8,b'4rrk1/pp3ppp/4p1n1/1Pbp4/8/6BP/1P3PP1/RN1R2K1 w - -',Black's first questionable move by my tastes. The other rook is doing nothing on f8 whereas 18...Rfe8 would have allowed a later Rac8 taking the open file or Rad8 placing both rooks behind the powerful central pawns.
65,2,13,d4,b'4rrk1/pp3ppp/4p1n1/1Pb5/3p4/2N3BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Understandable but careless in view of White's reply.
66,2,14,Bb6,b'4rrk1/pp3ppp/1b2p1n1/1P6/3pN3/6BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Any other bishop move allows Rxa7 and 20... Rc8 is met by 21. Nxc5 Rxc5 22. Rxd4 Rxb5. Black finishes still two pawns up but White has exchanged the worthless b5 pawn for the powerful d4 pawn.
67,2,15,Red8,b'3r1rk1/pp3ppp/1b1Np1n1/1P6/3p4/6BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',21... Rb8 is an interesting try here asking White to do his worst. After 22. Nxf7 Kxf7 23. Bxb8 Rxb8 Black's two minor pieces should be worth more than a rook; after 22. Nf5 Rd8 keeps everything defended; best is probably 22. Nc4 Rbd8 23. Nxb6 axb6 24. Ra7 Rd7 25. Rc1 intending Bc7.
68,2,16,2Nc4,b'5rk1/p2r1ppp/1b4n1/1P2p3/2Np4/6BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',A good choice of retreat combining defence with attack; on a later Rc8 (after defending the e-pawn) b3 keeps the c-file closed for at least a while.
69,2,17,2Rfd8,b'3r2k1/p2r1ppp/1b4n1/1P2p3/2Np4/6BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Oh dear what can the matter be?
70,2,18,2Bg3,b'3r2k1/p2r2pp/1b3p2/1P6/3p4/6BP/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Now material is level again at last. White has blockaded doubled pawns and Black has a passed pawn so Black looks better but the d-pawn will not be easy to advance now that it is isolated.
71,2,19,3Rc1,b'3r4/p2r2pp/1b3p2/1P1k4/3p4/3R2BP/1P3PP1/2R3K1 b - -',This move (together with the next) helps keep both open files guarded.
72,2,20,g5,b'3r4/p3r2p/1b3p2/1P1k2p1/3p4/3R2BP/1P3PP1/2R2K2 w - g6',Black could double his rooks on the e-file as White has no immediate threat of winning the d-pawn but he instead goes for kingside play perhaps hoping to break through with three pawns against three.
73,2,21,a5,b'3r4/4r3/1b3p2/pP1k2p1/1P1p3p/3R1P1P/5BP1/2R2K2 w - a6',A horrific blunder as the following play proves.
74,2,22,3bxa5,b'3r4/4r3/1b3p2/PP1k2p1/3p3p/3R1P1P/5BP1/2R2K2 b - -',This gives White the better game but he could have got (and kept) two passed pawns by 35. bxa6. Play might continue 35... Ra7 36. b5 Rb8 37. Rb3 Bd8 38. Ke2 intending Kd3 and Black has no easy way to win the b-pawn.
75,2,23,3Rc6+,b'3r4/4r3/2R1kp2/bP4p1/3R3p/5P1P/5BP1/5K2 b - -',An in-between check to drive Black's king away so that White's will have time to come to the defence of his pawn. 36. Rxd8 Bxd8 37. b6 Rb7 38. Rb1 Kd5 and Black will soon win the pawn.
76,2,24,4Bc5,b'3b4/1r3k2/1PR2p2/2B3p1/7p/5P1P/6P1/5K2 b - -',So that the rook can remain on the sixth rank after the anticipated Ke8 and Kd7.
77,2,25,Be7,b'2k5/1r2b3/1P1R1p2/2B3p1/7p/3K1P1P/6P1/8 w - -',It seems as though White's plan has failed....
78,2,26,4Rd5,b'2k5/1r2b3/1P3p2/2BR2p1/7p/3K1P1P/6P1/8 b - -',White cannot save the situation by 44. Rc6  Kd7 45. Rc7  Rxc7 46. bxc7 Kxc7 47. Bxe7 as Black just plays 46... Bxc5.
79,2,27,4Rxc5+,b'2k5/1r6/1P3p2/2R3p1/7p/3K1P1P/6P1/8 b - -',This check saves White allowing him to get his rook behind the pawn where it belongs.
80,2,28,4Rb5,b'8/1r1k4/1P3p2/1R4p1/7p/3K1P1P/6P1/8 b - -',But White misses a simpler continuation: 46. Rc7  Rxc7 47. bxc7 Kxc7 48. Ke4 Kd6 49. Kf5 Ke7 50. f4! gxf4 51. Kxf4 wins.
81,2,29,Rf7,b'8/5r2/1Pk2p2/5Rp1/7p/3K1P1P/6P1/8 w - -',Naturally 47... Rxb6 48. Rxf5  is game over and 47... Kxb6 48. Rxf5  isn't much better.
82,2,30,4Kc4,b'8/1k3r2/5p2/5Rp1/2K4p/5P1P/6P1/8 b - -',49. f4! gxf4 50. Rxf4 Rg7 51. Rg4 Rh7 52. Rg6 f5 53. Rg5 f4 54. Rf4 1-0
83,2,31,5f4,b'8/5r2/3k1p2/5Rp1/3K1P1p/7P/6P1/8 b - -',Now it's less effective as Black isn't forced to capture.
84,2,32,Rg7,b'8/6r1/4kp2/5Rp1/4KP1p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',52... gxf4 53. Rxf4 (not Kxg4? Rg7) Rh7 should be a draw as White can't afford to be left with just a rook's pawn.
85,2,33,fxg5,b'8/6r1/4k3/5Rp1/4K2p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',53... Rxg5 54. Rxg5 fxg5 is a clear-cut draw but 54. Rf2 doesn't seem to leave White much chance of winning either.
86,2,34,Kf6,b'8/6r1/5k2/2R3p1/4K2p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',The decisive blunder. 54... g4 is an easy draw; 55. Rc6  Kd7 gets White nowhere and neither does allowing the pawn exchange.
87,2,35,5Kf5,b'8/5kr1/2R5/5Kp1/7p/7P/6P1/8 b - -',A beautiful move quietly closing the coffin lid. 56. Rc7  any 57. Rxg7 Kxg7 58. Kf5 Kh6 would only be a draw.
88,2,36,5Rg8,b'6r1/5k2/2R5/5Kp1/7p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',As good or bad as any other move (except 56... Rg6 which really would be a blunder). Black has no escape.
89,2,37,5Rf6+,b'6r1/5k2/5R2/5Kp1/7p/7P/6P1/8 b - -',This is one way to do it but 57. Rc7  any 58. Rc8  any 59. Rxg8 Kxg8 60. Kxg5 any 61. Kxh4 was a straightforward crush.
90,2,38,Rh8,b'7r/4k3/6R1/6K1/7p/7P/6P1/8 w - -',Black must hold onto the h-pawn for as long as possible to make White's task more difficult.
91,2,39,6Kg4,b'7r/4k3/6R1/8/6Kp/7P/6P1/8 b - -',White cannot yet win the pawn by Rh6 because of Rg8 .

93,2,41,6Rh5,b'7r/8/5k2/7R/6Kp/7P/6P1/8 b - -',Now this move is correct.
94,2,42,Rf8,b'5r2/8/5k2/7R/7p/5K1P/6P1/8 w - -',The discovered check is powerless except to delay things a little.
95,2,43,6Rxh4,b'5r2/8/5k2/8/7R/5K1P/6P1/8 b - -',According to the Nalimov tablebase White mates in 40.
96,2,44,6Ra5+,b'8/8/8/R6k/8/4r2P/6PK/8 b - -',Both sides are playing good moves Black trying to delay the advance of the pawns White trying to regroup his pieces so he can start advancing them.
97,2,45,6Kh4,b'8/8/8/R7/7k/4r2P/6PK/8 w - -',A terrible blunder.
98,2,46,7Ra4+,b'8/8/8/8/R6k/4r2P/6PK/8 b - -',White misses the easy win: 70. g3 ! Rxg3 71. Ra4 . But the move played is still winning.
99,2,47,7g3,b'8/8/8/7k/R6P/2r3P1/7K/8 b - -',This will be White's main strategy: advance the h-pawn advance the g-pawn advance the king advance the rook to prepare for the h-pawn to advance again.
100,2,48,Rc4,b'8/8/7k/R6P/2r5/6PK/8/8 w - -',Note that it makes no difference whether or not Black unpins the pawn: after for example 75... Rb3 White would just play Kh4 and then g4.
101,2,49,Rc5,b'8/7k/R6P/2r5/6PK/8/8/8 w - -',79... Rc1 threatening some spite checks would delay the win a little longer but White can still advance: 80. Kh5 Rh1  81. Kg5 Rc1 82. Ra7  Kh8 83. Kh5 etc.
102,2,50,Kg8,b'6k1/R7/7P/2r3PK/8/8/8/8 w - -',White's next move threw away the win. Before reading on can you do better?
103,2,51,8h7+,b'6k1/R6P/8/2r3PK/8/8/8/8 b - -',83. Rd7!! mates in 21. In a sort of sideways Lucena position White can shelter from Black's checks by Kg4-f5-f6-e5 and Rd5. After this move it's a draw.
104,2,52,Rc6+,b'7k/R6P/2r4K/6P1/8/8/8/8 w - -',Black has two drawing strategies: the one played or 84... Ra5 and Black's rook will just mimic the movements of White's being immune to capture because of stalemate.
105,2,53,8g6,b'7k/R6P/2r3PK/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',After 85. Kh5 Black just moves the rook along the sixth rank and White can never make progress. Ra8  loses the h-pawn while g6 allows Rxg6.
106,2,54,8Rxg6+,b'7k/R6P/6rK/8/8/8/8/8 w - -',The clincher.
107,2,55,8Kxg6,b'7k/R6P/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',Stalemate. A fitting if bizarre end to an encounter in which both sides missed winning chances. White went on to win the group partly helped by me resigning in a balanced position after my loss to the player of Black in this game meant I couldn't progress from the group.

146,4,1,e5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPNQPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',This leaves a hole at d5 which White is able to exploit shortly.  In fact Black's pawn structure has two permanent holes (d5 and d6).  Also the text makes the Bd6 really bad (as stated above it probably shouldn't be there in the first place).  Perhaps playing for ..b6 and ..Bb7 was the best way to continue.
147,4,2,1c3,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2P2NP1/PP1NQPBP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',The advantage of the text is that it prevents ..Nd4.  Of course the disadvantage is that it leaves a hole at d3.  Still White's structure has just that one hole compared to the two for Black.

In this position I thought quite a bit about how to continue the attack.  I knew I was much better but couldn't figure out the best way to continue.  Then it hit me.  White can just win a piece.  Never overlook the obvious.

Bd7 still seems like a waste of time.  The more the b7 pawn is offered the more I feel that he wants the counterplay and time I would have to use repositioning the queen.  I think Qxb7 is perfectly playable but I know my nature as a chess player.  I could just as easily lose my queen as gain a solid two or three points heading towards a solid endgame.

Perhaps taking the relatively free material (e5) in exchange for a doubled pawn seems like a bargain but I felt my King's safety as a higher priority.
178,6,11,1b6,b'r2qk2r/p2b1ppp/1p1b1nn1/3Pp3/3P4/1QN3P1/PP2NPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',If he was going to play this move he should never have played Bd7.  Actually he should not have played Bd7 at all.  The f knight is vulnerable.  It needs to reposition before Bg5 but it has no great place to move.

The pin can be brutal and the pinned must be really careful because the knight (c3 here) can often force a doubled f pawn.  The pin undermines black claims on e4 and strongly discourages the black knight from moving.

The highlights of the position are as follows: The a8 rook will be lost if white gets to play NxN with tempo black's dark-squared bishop will be lost one way or another and white seems fine in the resulting play.  14...Bxd6? 15. Nxd6 exposing the black rook to white's LS bishop.  14... Nxe4 15. d6xe7 threatening queen and rook followed by 15... Qwhatever 16. exf8=Q  Q/Rxf8 17. Bxe4.  AND the line that follows:
182,6,15,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/p3bppp/1p1Pbnn1/4p1B1/3PN3/1Q4P1/PP2NPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Threatening the queen seems hollow.  What if I accept?  Even if I lose the queen a queen for a bishop and rook is very close to an equal exchange.  I can't say I actually worked it out.  It seemed to promise an interesting game so I played it!

O-O-O is not pleasant as queenside is so exposed but it is hard to gain enough moves to get the kingside free to castle especially as the f8 bishop is currently defending your queen.

Two bishops tend to be better than two knights or a bishop and a knight so the swap is beneficial for white generally. It also gives you an unpleasant choice. Either capture with the king leaving it exposed in the centre and unable to castle or capture with the queen and lose the knight at e4 (it is then pinned and you cannot escape from the d or f pawns if I advance them).

Something like Bb5 would retain the initiative and allow Ne4 to follow anyway."

if i were to come to any conclusion about this game it would have to be that even though switching queens may be favourable for black it always depends on the circumstances and may prove fatal for black 

hope you've enjoyed my first and probably last annotated game hope to hear any comments from more experienced players

287,12,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Most played moves in the first moves of a chess gamei think.
288,12,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The counter attack starts.
289,12,2,Nxf7,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',He forks the queen and rook.But no matteri will win a pawn for now.
290,12,3,Kf1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',He doesn't capture the bishop because 6.Kxf2 Axe4  black gains tempo and with 7...d5 he gets a strong attack.
291,12,4,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqNpp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',Naturally i  prefer queen than the rook.
292,12,5,Nxh8,b'r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q -',He takes my rook.

294,12,7,Ne4+,b'r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/8/3Pp3/2Bnn3/8/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ3R w q -',Gaining tempo when he captures the bishop and this attack will force to draw.
295,12,8,Qh2+,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/8/3Pp3/2Bn4/8/PPPP1K1q/RNBQ4 w q -',i have checked again and again cause i did not want to try to find the winning line.It was good to draw a higher rated player i thought and did not wanna take risk.However no development at white's side maybe i could win.If someone found the winning variation please tell me.
296,12,9,Qf4+,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/8/3Pp3/2Bn1q2/4K3/PPPP4/RNBQ4 w q -',And with triple repeat game was decided as draw.
297,12,10,2Kd3,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/8/3Pp3/2Bn1q2/3K4/PPPP4/RNBQ4 b q -',Here is the final position.
298,13,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White immediately challenges Black's central control.
299,13,1,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Black cannot play Bg7 lazily without thought or else he loses both bishop and rook.  With the knight immediately threatened black cannot trap the queen in the corner depriving white of the queen for the immediate future.  The problem is that the queen provides a tasty target once the forced Nf6 is played.
300,13,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/4P3/3Q4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',And the f6 knight gets away.
301,13,3,Qe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/3nP3/4Q3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',If 7... e6 then 8. c4.
302,13,4,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppnppp1p/2n3p1/4P3/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq c3',Oddly enough white plays c4 anyway.  Three possible reasons for the move exist.  These include limiting the scope of the c7 knight hoping for a knight outpost at d5/b5 or c5 followed with bringing the bishop to bear upon f7 via Bc4.  Black has enough tempo to easily escape the bishop threat.  And without preparation black could drive a knight from either of the potential outposts with simple pawn moves.
303,13,5,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/4P3/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Planning on challenging the advanced e pawn while preparing to castle.  Advancing the e pawn further only gives it away for free.  If the e pawn falls then White's b pawn becomes painfully pinned.  White is controlling more space but black is more secure in the immediate future.
304,13,6,Bf4,b'r1bqk2r/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/4P3/2P1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',The b pawn was already secure for the moment.  I would have preferred development.  Because there isn't a good place for White's light-squared bishop the knight on b could be developed.  White might be tempted to castle queen-side but the likelihood of black eventually placing a rook on c8 should temper this desire.
305,13,7,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/4P3/2P1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',I perhaps should have considered b6 but there is nothing wrong with the move here.
306,13,8,1c5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/2P1P3/4QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',One promising plausible alternative is 10. Qe3 threatening to exchange dark squared bishops.  The pawn on c4 would prevent Nd5 challenging the Queen (without the pawn the continuation would probably favor White but without the pawn White could not force the exchange).
307,13,9,1Ne6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/2P1P3/4QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',This primarily accomplishes two things:  The Black queen has been freed and it forestalls for some time --maybe even permanently-- exchanging dark-square bishops.  If white plays Qe3 threating to exchange black can simply play Nxf4.
308,13,10,Qa5+,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/q1P1P3/2B1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Capturing the pawn with the queen undermines the hold on e5.  Black can bring pieces to capture it faster than white can support it.  I like bringing out the queen when she cannot easily be captured and when she helps reduce the power of the opposing queen.
309,13,11,1Nbd2,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/q1P1P3/2B1QB2/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I was expecting Bd2.  The e pawn is already lost.
310,13,12,1Rac1,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/2q1n3/2B2Q2/5N2/PP1N1PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Anticipating this move made me think quite a bit before I played Nxe5 but I had a solution in mind.
311,13,13,1Nxf3+,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/2q5/2B2Q2/5n2/PP1N1PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',I didn't like exchanging the perfectly good knight but defending it seemed complicated.  Now there is nothing to defend and I can simply try to find the best square for the queen before Bxf7 .
312,13,14,e6,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1pbp/1q2p1p1/8/2B2Q2/5N2/PPR2PPP/5RK1 w - -',I didn't want to walk into a nasty pin after 17... Bxb2 18. Rb1!  so I had to find something to improve the position.  My advantage so far is the dark square bishop so I decided to attempt to minimize the influence to White's only bishop.
313,13,15,2Ne5,b'r4rk1/pp1b1pbp/1q2p1p1/3pN3/5Q2/1B6/PPR2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',I didn't anticipate this and it almost cost the advantage I had.  Perhaps I should have traded the dark square bishop for the knight but I really wanted its power to be felt...
314,13,16,2Bc6,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/1qb1p1p1/3pN3/5Q2/1B6/PPR2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',It's hard to call this a mistake because even now I see problems after 20... Bb5 21. Rec1 but it certainly wasn't the game I was hoping for.  Closing the c file seemed like a good way to give me time to manuever my rooks into play and I was hoping he wouldn't exchange.
315,13,17,2Qd6,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1qpQp1p1/3p4/8/1B6/PPR2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Well Qxc6 was impossible but even so that queen is marginalizing any advantage I have.  I want her gone.
316,13,18,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/p4pbp/1qpQp1p1/3p4/8/1B6/PPR2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',My c6 pawn is holding for now.
317,13,19,2Rec1,b'2r2rk1/p4pbp/1qpQp1p1/3p4/8/1B6/PPR2PPP/2R3K1 b - -',I could see before this that saving the pawn wasn't an option which ironically ends up saving the pawn.  I came up with a crafty challenge to his queen that maintains rough equality and possibly an advantage and although I didn't find the best line which definitely brings about an advantage until later analysis it's clear my opponent did see the bigger threat.
318,13,20,2Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/p4pbp/1qpQp1p1/3p4/8/1B6/PPR2PPP/2R3K1 w - -',"The continuations are as follows.
24.Rxc6 
[a] 24... Rxd6 
[a1] 25.Rxc8  Bf8 is very good for Black netting 3 points for a total of 5 points up.
[a2] 25.Rxb6 Rxc1 ! producing a forced mate.
[b] my original 24... Qxc6?? which leads to rough equality.

320,13,22,Bg7,b'2rr2k1/p4pbp/1q2p1p1/3p4/B1p5/8/PPRQ1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Better was Rc7.  Cautious play can be dangerous too!

324,14,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"A very interesting end game. The Bishop and Knight Mate is the most difficult of the so-called ""elementary"" mates and there is nothing elementary about them for a beginner player.... or even a more experienced one. It is a very rare ending but it is a very useful to learn how to do this otherwise the game will sure to be thrown into a draw either due to 50 move rule or a stalemate. This would be off course unfortunate because it is a won game but one must know exactly what to do. I will deal with this more in detail toward the end but for right now lets begin: "
325,14,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I am dealing clearly with a superior player so my strategy in such matches is always the same: MUST TAKE RISKS or else I won't stand a chance. (I will probably lose either way but if I take a risk I have at least a remote chance of surprising my opponent and create an interesting game).
326,14,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"In all of my wins against 1800  players (berbatov was ranked over 1800 at the time we started) it always happened in the same way: Develop a board ""feature"" and then take advantage of it. You will see what I mean by that in the coming moves."
327,14,3,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So far standard opening. I was going for a Slav defense since that seems to be a less played game around here and it takes some people by surprise. Exchange variation.
328,14,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Not fully familiar with this development but again I am willing to take chances against berbatov.
329,14,5,Bg5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3p1p/2n1p1p1/3p2B1/3P4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Awkward move for me. I did not like it but there it was and I had to deal with it. I took my time to play my next move.
330,14,6,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp5p/2n1ppp1/3p2B1/3P4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I was forced to ruin my king side protection for the castling. The bishop position was so dangerous that I felt I had no option.
331,14,7,e3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp4bp/2n1ppp1/3p4/3P1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',After this move I started feeling better about that development. Fianchetto in place his dark bishop squeezed my castling options still alive.
332,14,8,a6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p4bp/p1n1ppp1/3p4/3P1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Passive but against a stronger players I put more emphasis on developing than attacking. I really don't want his Nb5.
333,14,9,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n1ppp1/3p4/3P1B2/PQN1PN2/1P3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Preparing to castle.
334,14,10,1Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n1ppp1/3p4/3P1B2/PQNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',berbatov developing further. Again something I noticed a higher ranked players tend to do. More emphasis on a development. It usually creates a richer and more complex game with greater number of possibilities. That makes sense considering that a higher number of strong pieces are involved in the game.
335,14,11,1e5,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n2pp1/3pp3/3P1B2/PQNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I am starting to exploit the Bishop's position and I am pushing my pawns. Pawn game is in general not a good strategy against a stronger player but that Bishop was asking for it. In addition I get to push my pawn in the center. 
336,14,12,1Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n3p1/3pp1B1/8/PQNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Darn I knew that that Bishop will be a pest.
337,14,13,1e4,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n3p1/3p2B1/4p3/PQNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I really wanted to gain some center control and some piece advantage. I sacrificed my King's protection to do this and I knew this. I was willing to take that chance. Note that he has a lot of heavy artillery pointed in the direction of my King's area. 
338,14,14,1Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/1p2n1bp/p1n3p1/6B1/4N3/PQ2PN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I am a pawn up but my King seems naked. I am sure berbatov was fine with this. I am a bit underdeveloped to boot.
339,14,15,1Qa5+,b'r1b1k2r/1p2n1bp/p1n3p1/q5B1/4N3/PQ2PN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Here I gain a tempo move. I figured I gained a pawn advantage but he had position on me. If I could gain a tempo move maybe I make up for the position disadvantage and perhaps retain my piece advantage.
340,14,16,axb5,b'r1b1k2r/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/1p4B1/8/P3PN2/1P1N1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',"This was another result of Qb5 I was aiming for. I wanted to develop a ""feature"" namely an early a-file opening. And this is the formula I have followed in the past against superior opponents. Now my job is not to let that feature go to waste and hopefully take advantage of it. I might end up sacrificing few pieces on the way but I need to be on a look out to maximize this a-file opening. This now becomes my sole focus."
341,14,17,1O-O-O,b'r1b1k2r/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/1p4B1/8/P3PN2/1P1N1PPP/2KR3R b kq -',berbatov didn't seem to be concerned with the a-file threat.... I wonder why because now my mission is starting to crystallize.
342,14,18,1b4,b'r1b1k2r/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/6B1/1p6/P3PN2/1P1N1PPP/2KR3R w kq -',You see where I am going with this.
343,14,19,1Nc4,b'r1b1k2r/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/6B1/1pN5/P3PN2/1P3PPP/2KR3R b kq -',I didn't like this move. It was threatening my King with Nd6. Also his rook is poised to strike since d-file is clear. I had to abandon my attack temporarily and castle immediately.
344,14,20,2Nb6,b'r1b2rk1/1p2n1bp/1Nn3p1/6B1/1p6/P3PN2/1P3PPP/2KR3R b - -',"I sure didn't like this move. However I was fully committed to the ""feature"" developed. Note that I have Bg7 poised to support the b-pawn advancement. Furthermore the Rf8 was also ready to connect with the Ra8 as soon Bc8 moves away. Meanwhile I had to deal with Nb6. After a long time thinking I decided to go for a sacrifice and the next 7 moves were calculated in advance. I surprised even myself with this sequence. (I am usually not this creative but this idea of taking advantage of a feature developed tends to open all sorts of secret doors)."
345,14,21,2bxa3,b'r1b2rk1/1p2n1bp/1Nn3p1/6B1/8/p3PN2/1P3PPP/2KR3R w - -',I go for it!
346,14,22,axb2+,b'N1b2rk1/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/6B1/8/4PN2/1p3PPP/2KR3R w - -',Check. Kb1 would not be the best move. Can you see why?
347,14,23,Bf5,b'N4rk1/1p2n1bp/2n3p1/5bB1/8/4PN2/1p1K1PPP/3R3R w - -',That's why. This would force Ka2 and then RxNa8  ... not a good development for white. So really Kd2 is the only viable option.
348,14,24,2Nb6,b'5rk1/1p2n1bp/1Nn3p1/5bB1/8/4PN2/1p1K1PPP/3R3R b - -',He saves the Knight but ....
349,14,25,Bxb1,b'6k1/1p2n1bp/1Nn3p1/6B1/8/4PN2/4KPPP/1b6 w - -',And now I come out of that exchange ahead with the b-pawn poised to Queen.
350,14,26,3Bf2,b'6k1/1p2n1b1/1Nn4p/6p1/8/4PP2/b2NKBPP/8 b - -',I am pushing my pawns while cramping his Bishop.
351,14,27,3Nd5,b'6k1/1p4b1/1Nn4p/3n2p1/8/4PP2/b2NKBPP/8 w - -',I needed to free the b-file for the pawn.
352,14,28,Ba2,b'6k1/1p4b1/2n4p/6p1/4P3/5P2/b2NKBPP/8 w - -',Positioning the bishop to protect the b-pawn queening.

354,14,30,Ba1,b'6k1/8/2n4p/4P1p1/1p2NP2/6P1/b3KB1P/b7 w - -',That pawn is going home right?
355,14,31,b3,b'6k1/8/8/4n3/4N3/1p4P1/b3KB1P/b7 w - -',Almost there.
356,14,32,4Nd2,b'6k1/8/8/4n3/8/1p4P1/b2NKB1P/b7 b - -',"I really didn't want to end up with some ""crazy"" Bishop Knight or Bishop Bishop end game and I was willing to sacrifice whatever it takes so that I can queen my b-pawn. I wasn't even sure that the game can be finished with Bishop Knight or Bishop Bishop."
357,14,33,4Bc3,b'6k1/8/8/4n3/8/1pb3P1/b2NKB1P/8 w - -',I had to attack the Nd2.
358,14,34,4Ne4,b'6k1/8/8/4n3/4N3/1pb3P1/b3KB1P/8 b - -',He is just making all of my plans very difficult. 
359,14,35,4Nd2,b'6k1/8/8/4n3/8/1p4P1/b2NKB1P/b7 b - -',Ok different approach now:
360,14,36,Nh6,b'6k1/6b1/7n/8/8/1p4PP/b2NK3/6B1 w - -',Well that didn't help.
361,14,37,4Kd3,b'6k1/6b1/7n/8/6P1/3K3P/bp1N4/6B1 b - -',I am starting to realize I will not be able to avoid the dreaded B-K or B-B end game.
362,14,38,Bxb1+,b'6k1/6b1/7n/8/6P1/3K3P/8/1b4B1 w - -',I have a significant piece advantage but I am still unsure I can finish this. Once I clear his pawns I will be  6 on him and still might not end up being able to finish. This is when I started to research the BB and BK end game.
363,14,39,5Kxf4,b'8/5n2/5k2/8/5KPP/8/8/1b6 b - -',Great! I ended up with BK end game which turns out to be the hardest one. Even BB although still not easy is easier than BK.
364,14,40,5Ne5,b'8/8/5k2/4n3/5KPP/8/8/1b6 w - -',At this point my next goal is to eliminate the pawns first.
365,14,41,6h6,b'8/6Pb/5k1P/4n3/5K2/8/8/8 b - -',It got pretty hairy as those pawns got pretty close to queening but it was really a formality. It was going to happen one way or another. However don't think that I didn't spend hours thinking carefully through each move making sure I don't make a mistake. 
366,14,42,Nxh6,b'6b1/8/5k1n/8/4K3/8/8/8 w - -',And finally here we are. I asked berbatov here to play till the end as I planned to annotate this ending. He graciously obliged. He himself was curious how to finish this as he wasn't sure it can be done either.

As a white you should stay away from a lower rings (lowest ring being h8-a8-a1-h1 the second one would be g7-b7-b2-g2 etc). Berbatov doesn't seem to care so much about making my job harder so at times he drops the to the lower ring without being forced to.

I agree that White's plan is easier to adopt than blacks but it makes no difference of the objective assesment of the opening.

I do think that the opening is rather one-sided and I'm going to take some other openings against 1.e4 on my repertoire aswell. I've had bad score against the Scheveningen so maybe I should experiment that line."

White strenghtens his center preparing to castle long advance his h-pawn and checkmate down the h-file. Some games are this simple actually.
385,16,3,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',I like to think that this knight's job is to force White make some sort of concessions at the queenside. Whether it is to give up the useful light-squared bishop (and so weaken the light squares) or to distrup the pawn formation or something else something for black to attack.
386,16,4,Bc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',The most agressive variation. The pin on the f7-pawn might turn useful if white plays h4-h5xg6 because black would like to answer fxg6 keeping the h-file closed and to clear escape route for the king. It also defends the queenside lightsquares and prevents the move d5. However the minus side of this bishop move is linked with loss of time. It is forced to move to b3 and many times equally forced to trade itself to a knight landing on c4. Thus some players prefer 9.0-0-0 d5 but it it mostly matter of taste.
387,16,5,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Making room for rook to come to f8. The bishop is not very happy on this square but there is no better square right now. 
388,16,6,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Ideally black would like the other rook to come to f8 but there is no fully acceptable square for the queen right now. There is a notoriously sharp variation 10...Qa5 but the modern theory seems to dislike this move. 
389,16,7,1Bb3,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',A common theme - there is no immediate threat against the bishop but he will have to retreat it sooner or later so white mantains maximum flexibility with the text.

I played this move at the first time in this game mostly because I've had more problems breaking this formation as white than those where black allows the move h5. It's a little suspicious to play at the side of board where your opponent is stronger though...

I remember that I once read John Nunn writing something like that there are two ways to play the Dragon (or was it about all positions with opposite-side castling...)  the safe and the attacking way. The other is to use minimum amount of preventive moves on the side you are defending and use every possible tempo to attack on the other side - and this is the safe way! The other way is to completely ingore the opposite attack and trust that you are the one qho checkmates faster. 

It seems that black is now playing the ""safe"" way."

Sergei Karjakin once wrote on his blog something like: It's easy to win with the Dragon. Just move your rook to c5 sacrifice it to anything that comes to the fifth rank pick up pawn(s) and win the endgame. Sometimes things may be that simple...

After 18...Nxd1 white can deliver check with pawn or bishop but after 19.fxf7  Kh8 or 19. Bxf7  Rxf7 20.gxf7  Kf8 There are several hanging white pieces and black gains free hand to operate at the queenside. Black king looks airy but there are no quick ways to kill. I don't remember what I had prepared to it at the time of this game.... Maybe I should Fritz the position. 
403,16,21,Rxb3+,b'2q2rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1nP1/6B1/3NP1pP/1r6/PKP1Q3/3R3R w - -',And so black finally gets rid of the white LSB at the cost of an exchange. Not many other possibilities here though. The white king gets a bit airy and now Black is constantly looking ways to exploit it.

If white captures then after ...Rf2  blacks attack would most probably crash trough. But I couldn't see anything acceptable after the simple 22.Rc1 so I decided to renew the threat while activating the queen. Now White takes blacks word and makes a preventive move.

410,16,28,2Bh6,b'5rk1/pp1bp1b1/3p1npB/8/3NP1pP/qP2Q3/P7/1K1R3R b - -',Now white decides to act on the kingside deciding to answer ...Nxe4 with Bxg7 with complications that are far too hard to analyze for me.
411,16,29,2Nxe4,b'5rk1/pp1bp1b1/3p2pB/8/3Nn1pP/qP2Q3/P7/1K1R3R w - -',Black steps bravely into the action. With this move black is willing to sacrifice at least a piece in some lines even more.

414,16,32,2Bf5,b'6k1/pp2p1B1/3p2p1/5b2/4n1pP/qP2Q3/P1N2r2/1K1R3R w - -',"Jacob Aagaard one of my favourite chess authors once established a ""90% rule""  - 9 times out of ten the move you want to make for positional reasons works out tactically too. So black wants his whole army to work together and this is clearly the best square for this bishop. So we can forget such minor tactical problems as a hanging queen. It is still not sure if blacks gamble work out - he is down a rook for three pawns. However the activity of black forces and the incoming pin of the knight will give him such a pressure on whites position that (or that is what he trusts) black will win atleast an exchange back and then have three pawns for the exchange - two of them doubled and isolated though.

I would like to add that this sort of move is very very hard to resist. It is so aesthetically pleasing that black felt that he must try it. That is probably why he played 23...Nxe4 in the first place."

All his pieces are better than their white counterparts and he has a nice bind on white not to mention the two central pawns that may turn into a great force in a endgame. One gets the feeling that white's extra rook is not doing everything it can...
417,16,35,Nxc5,b'6k1/pp2p3/3p2p1/2n2b2/6pP/1P6/PBN2r2/1K1R3R w - -',"Now it becomes clear that white cannot mantain all of his material lead. He must now decide the best way to give up the exchange back.

It is suprising how active all black pieces became. Not the same can be said about white pieces the b2-bishop looks nice but without other pieces it does nothing. The knight is doomed to a poor square and the rooks can't do much right now. Lead in developement is not however a permanent advantage so black must do something with it."

420,16,38,gxf5,b'6k1/pp2p3/3p4/5p2/6pP/1P1n4/PBN1r3/1K5R w - -',So black has three pawns for a bishop. White has a passer and now his rook is in a good position but black has four (!) connected passed pawns.

Now the game turns into a Rook and knight endgame with two extra pawns for black not to mention the superior rook. In my notes I had this line: 35.Ng5 Nf4 36.Ne4 Nh3!? It is a long time ago since I analysed this since at this point my opponent started using all the 5 days for every move maybe waiting my rating to rise (his rating had gone up to 1830 or something) so he would not lose so many points.

35.Ng5 is at least something active. If black does nothing white simply advances his h-pawn to victory. Now 35...g3 36.Nf3 locks the rook out forever so 35...Nf4 looks best. After 36.Ne4 Nh3!? black threatents to win a bishop with Rg8  or force the bishop out of the long diagonal with ...e5 ...d5 and ...d4. It's not clear if wghite can do anything for that.

And perhaps a Queen on h5 and the knight on f5. He'll especially be in trouble if his pawn on d6 captures on e5 or c5 for some reason. In short if white can get a bit ahead in development and bring her knight on a2 back into action perhaps a rook on c6 black will be in a lot of trouble. Watch out for Nc5 though.  I don't see the sequence of moves that make all these possible both in a closed position like this all you can do is improve your position in small bits until something pays off.

The next phase of the game consisted of pawn pushes that left ended up with White promoting on b8 at the same time that black promoted on g1 with a white pawns remaining on h4 and d5 and black pawns on d6 and h5.  Black was in better position with his queen so he forced a queen trade then captured the white pawn on h4 and was able to promote his h5 pawn and then ended with a White resignation.  This was a difficult endgame position.

551,24,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"Frequently black's c pawn is exchanged for the white d pawn.  Consequently black often seeks to place a rook on the half open c file.  The Sicilian defense discourages an immediate d4.  White can play d4. 1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Nf3 (Qxd4) Nc6. You'll probably like the line if you study and play the center-counter defense.  It's ""a book line that's generally considered inferior to the 'main' line"" as pointed out by GK player nuntar but as is often the case proving an inferiority is probably difficult even for expert players.  At any rate d4 would probably discourage black from implementing a king-side fianchetto."
552,24,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White's normal response prepares d4 and avoids such committing moves as f4 or d3 or Nc3 which have their own rationale.

For this reason Black may elect after 3.d4 to play 3...Bg7 allowing the cramping 4.d5 which also turns out to White's favor in the long run.
554,24,4,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Black breathes a sigh of relief.  While I had no computer analysis during the game my own experiences with the English opening have shown that the Queen capture is quite playable.  4.Qxd4 is also a forcing move that pressures black to play Nf3 before he may wish to.
555,24,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This gives no clues to black's possible development plans.  It also allows black to see how white will proceed.
556,24,6,c4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Standard Sicilian lines would play Nc3 here.  White arrives at a position identical to games where play proceeds 1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bg7 5. e4 which could be described as transposing to the English opening.  White chooses to play a Maroczy bind position.  This position is frequently enough used that there is a Wikipedia page devoted to it.  (This page lacks any analysis though.)  After some disappointing tests of Chess Openings for White explained I would take Alburt and Dzindzischavili's claim in the CO for White counterpart book that black need no longer fear the bind a little skeptically.  See John Watson's review of their book for white on Jeremy Silman's site.
557,24,7,e6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I didn't like the idea of Nf6 being challenged by e5.  While it's true that the knight can escape the advance by the simple Qa5  followed by Qxd5  I am more familiar with the placement on e7 which escapes the pawn's harrassment at the cost of the bishop pin.  Arrakis08 feels that this is a bad move creating serious problems.  But could we truly say serious? 6.Nb5 threatens Nd6  and Nc7  if he can manage to cover c7 to prevent Qxc7. Yes black doesn't seem to have a preferable way to deal with both threats created by Nb5 but is 6... d6 so bad? If white follows with Bf4 then e5. Black suddenly becomes vulnerable to Bc4 but white has to move the c pawn first. I think black has sufficient resources to deal with the threats. If 6...e6 might not be a great move but it's not a blunder and I have to ask what would the preferred move be?  Perhaps 5.Nf6 which allows castling immediately removing one of the two threats (Nd6 ) behind Nb5?
558,24,8,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I imagine that many players like this position because they have positional elements of the Sicilian mainline with a pawn at c4 restraining d5.  Since the claims are 5...e6 is bad I edited commentary into the analysis of 5...e6.
559,24,9,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/6B1/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is a common motif.  I've played it and won with it but I have my doubts about its soundness especially because the knight is placed on e7 instead of f6.  It's clearly a common goal to induce h6 here and yet h6 can be part of a kingside attack.  Black can respond with f6 h6 or ignore the pin.  I've played f6 before but to me it seems awkward.  One of the reasons to play Ne7 is to leave the f pawn free to advance if appropriate but if black proceeds with an eventual f5 the bishop is free to return to pin the knight.  Ignoring the pin can be dangerous and h6 is frequently played in such situations.  As such I chose it.
560,24,10,Bh4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pnpb1/4p1pp/8/2PNP2B/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White invites the charging g5 but the games I've played it have imploded back upon me.  None of the materials I have on this position are written from the black perspective and none of the ones written for white suggest it but the move can have a real rationale for it:  Inducing g5 and playing Bg3 to control c7.  If black plays g5 white gets to play Bg3 with tempo.  Because of this I'm still willing to play it but I figure moves preparing it are necessary.  The pin is still there but for the moment it seems safe to ignore.
561,24,11,Ndb5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pnpb1/4p1pp/1N6/2P1P2B/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I have always thought this a strange move.  If I had played g5 and he had responded Bg3 this move could be particularly annoying.  With c7 guarded well attempts to control the square amount to Na6 or e5.
562,24,12,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpb1/2n1p1pp/1N6/2P1P2B/2N5/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Interesting.  Quite often the idea of Qd2 is to exchange the DS-bishop but that is improbable here and one of his strongest tactical ideas is Bg3.  This allows castling queenside but this position isn't near enough to the Yugoslav attack lines favorable to white that it cannot be clearly good yet.
563,24,13,1Nd6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pnpb1/p1nNp1pp/8/2P1P2B/2N5/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',He had too many defenders on d5 for me to play it and the knight is problematic exerting influence all over the black camp.

Both are loose goals of these openings but I can't see how he can exploit d5 yet because of the e pawn.  And yet I move it?  He gains access to d5.  I fully gain access to d4.  And suddenly the contemplation of f5 is interesting.  CM later recommends f4 but I must ask ""Why not play it now?""  I originally thought it should wait until after f6 but now thanks in part to analysis by dmaestro it's clear it should wait until white has prepared for the exf4 capture because of the subsequent piece-forking pawn advance.  I think castling kingside accomplishes this preparation."

568,24,18,1Nd4,b'r1bq1r2/1p1pn1bk/p2N1ppp/3Np3/2PnP2B/8/PP1QBPPP/3RK2R w K -',His knight is now only supported by pawns.  His queen is too valuable to exchange for my knight.  His DS-bishop is out of place to challenge my knight.  His knight on d5 suddenly feels lifeless though I didn't recognize it yet.  I don't quite believe he did either.  The only problem with this move is that the knight on e7 is placed well for a Kingside expansion and this move allows the e7 knight to be exchanged.  I feel though that the move is necessary.  I had to keep the center closed to play on the flank.
569,24,19,1Bg4,b'r1bq1r2/1p1pn1bk/p2N1ppp/3Np3/2PnP1BB/8/PP1Q1PPP/3RK2R b K -',I really had no intention of exchanging my central knight for his scopeless bishop.  His position is creaking but I still feel his pressure.  The subsequent CM analysis says: Slightly better is Bd3.  Though CM cannot elaborate on why I can:  flank attacks are going to be the order of the day.  One of the little chess rules of thumb about flank attacks is the center must hold.  Bd3 reinforces the center and should the white e pawn get exchanged it will pin the g pawn.
570,24,20,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1r2/1p1p2bk/p2N1ppp/3np3/2PnP1BB/8/PP1Q1PPP/3RK2R w K -',I exchange my knight for his stronger central knight.
571,24,21,b5,b'r1bq1r2/3p2bk/p2N1ppp/1p1Pp3/3nP1BB/8/PP1Q1PPP/3RK2R w K b6',I didn't want to play this move but the c8 bishop is in the way.  I felt it a mistake because black can play the subsequent idea which CM did not like either a move earlier.  In the CM analysis: Leads to 17.f4 Qc7 18.Nxc8 Nc2  19.Kf1 exf4 20.d6 Qxc8 21.Kg1 Ne3 22.Rc1 which wins a knight and a pawn for a bishop. Better is h5 leading to 17.Be2 g5 18.Bg3 h4 19.Rc1 hxg3 20.hxg3  Kg8 21.Bg4 Qb6 22.Nf5 Nxf5 23.Bxf5 which wins a bishop and a knight for a knight and a pawn. This was black's only significant error but the game remained within reach of either player.
572,24,22,1O-O,b'r1bq1r2/3p2bk/p2N1ppp/1p1Pp3/3nP1BB/8/PP1Q1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',I suspected that f4 was called for by white but CM suggests it here.  I believe it was called for after black was forced to play f6.

I can play g6 and Bg7 on one side and Qc7 on the other - so in three moves I can get three separate pieces attacking the pawn of which g6 and Bg7 are natural developing moves anyway. You don't want to have to tie up your pieces to defending pawns this early on.

Here black blocks the d-pawns advance.  An interesting try would have been 6...exd4 where either the immediate 7. cxd4 or 7. Nxd4 Nxd4 8. cxd4 run into Bb4  where after 7. Bd2 or 8. Bd2 the exchanges give black a simplified position to defend with the pawn plus still well in his possession.

Be3 but I decided to keep my bishop in a position where Ba3 is possible though this variation of the Evan's clearly makes it unlikely.  Also in my mind was 8. Qb3 which is also a common theme in some Evan's games.  It could have been very powerful here as his Light-squared bishop is trapped by the d-pawn which is trapped by the Dark-squared bishop.

Here instead black imagines a counter-attack on white's bishop perhaps but the bishop can be just as powerful from b3 or d5 as from c4.  Better would be b7 (to get the bishop into the game) or even a try at the dangerous-looking h6.

I open the way for my queen and I eye the f5 square for my knight as well as f-pawn storms.  Perhaps a little premature and it does block my h-pawn but it was an attacking move and I do like to attack even hastily.

Somehow that Dark-square bishop was giving me such problems that I decided to trade my light-square bishop for it when I could have won it outright.  I think there is an important lesson in this.  Often I (and I hope that I am not alone) get so focused on one piece or plan or idea my opponent has that I forget to watch the board.  Naturally right after I hit submit I saw what I missed and felt quite foolish.  A little more time thinking and I'm sure I would have seen the right move.

850,38,8,Ne4,b'r1q1r1k1/p2bb1pp/2p1p3/3pN1B1/3Nn3/8/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',White has not reached a point where all this pieces are attacking and must now make some exchanges.
851,38,9,2b4,b'4r1k1/p3r1pp/3Qp3/1q1p2P1/1P1p4/P4P2/2P3P1/2R1R1K1 b - b3',This is a massive blunder for White.  Black now has the opportunity to move Qa4 which attacks both the c and a pawns.  Given White's position he can only protect one of these two pieces and when Black captures one of these pawns that remaining pawns will soon fall.
852,38,10,2Qxb6,b'4r1k1/p3r1pp/1Q2p3/3p2P1/1P1p4/P4P2/2P3P1/2R1R1K1 b - -',White takes the opportunity to exchange the queens and push to move to an end game where Blacks a pawn (soon to be b pawn) and center pawns are not as strong as White's structure.
853,38,11,Kd6,b'8/3r3p/3k2p1/1p1p2P1/1P3P2/P4KP1/8/4R3 w - -',A better move would have been Rc1 allowing the rook to move to c5 attacking the two pawns.  One of these would then fall and possibility create two passed pawns on a and b.  The White king is still in positions to prevent the d pawn from scoring if Black just pushes past White's rook.
854,38,12,4Rf2,b'8/7p/6p1/1p4P1/1Pkr1PP1/P2p4/3K1R2/8 b - -',(Look at f5 instead)

859,39,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',hmm now this is deifferent.
860,39,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',well lets see where this goes.
861,39,5,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',making me move the knight again which i assumed he would do
862,39,6,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p2n/4N3/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',odd way to bring him out onto the rim
863,39,7,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p2n/4N3/4pP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',continue development and attack  e4
