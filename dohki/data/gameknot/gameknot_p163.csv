It could also be classified as a line-clearing sacrifice since White chose to capture the Knight on d5 with his Queen thereby keeping his pawn on e6.  

The main points to note are the two White rooks and queen on the d e and f files (with no other pieces to obstruct the White rooks from moving freely along his first rank) the advanced pawn on f6 the advanced pawn on e5 ready to move on to e6 if given an opportunity the unobstructed mobility of the queen and the knight on d4 which can quickly penetrate into Black's position.

136,7,18,Qg2,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2PP1b2/BPNB4/P1K2Pq1/R2Q3R w kq -',The queen simply moves back to its original square. Black loses a tempo as a result. She now threatens check instead of a pin but it's easily defensible.
137,7,19,Ne7,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1nppp/4p3/8/2PP1b2/BPNB4/P1K2Pq1/R3Q2R w kq -',Black still can't castle because the knight would be hanging. Protect it and castling would leave it pinned to the rook.
138,7,20,Bg3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1nppp/4p3/1N6/2PP4/BP1B2b1/P1K2Pq1/R3Q2R w kq -',Luckily this bishop still guards c7 from a fork or rook trap. This threat should be resolved with a6 forcing the knight back and gaining a tempo before continuing with Bg3.

This is only my second win of the tournament so far.  I did not think that I was gonna win especially down bucket loads of material against a Class C Player called Steve - he is an opponent to watch as he has an Expert Draw against a 2100+ player under his belt.  Then I decided to sacrifice a second rook for a knight luring the enemy bishop away from Steve's defense.  He took the rook and then I took a pawn opening up a line for Glenda.  Now how did my Good Witch of the North take advantage of this line opener?  Well read on!"

So I left my rook to hang.

Steve has no other legal move than to capture Fou Leblanc than NXN.  Now Glenda can deal death on e2.  Having found myself in a hopelessly lost position against a 1900+ player and having the possibility of losing 5.5 rating points to him I decided to resign that game and then set up Qxe2# in response to NXN as a conditional move before going to bed.  I woke up the next morning and gameknot confirmed that I had got most of those lost points back - nice.  Commiserations to Steve in this line of the Traxler Old Matey can strike out of a blue sky!  I must watch out as I have the white pieces against Steve and I must ensure that he does NOT get his revenge!

442,21,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Continuing development. Usually my next move would be d4 but not in this game.

453,21,17,Ne6,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/4nq2/7Q/2B1PB2/3P4/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w kq -',Black needs to defend. This was probobly the best move.

7.   Can I increase the actvity of my pieces... Yes by ""exchanging"" Nh4 for Bg6 white will gain greater control over the white squares.    
8.   Can I restrict the activity of my opponents pieces ... Yes 7.  ...Bg4  or e6 would  be a greater ""test"" of white idea
9.   What is my strategic plan short & long term...white would like to gain greater control over the white squares & gain greater influence in the center by playing e4 siezing more space & cramping blacks game.
10.  What is blacks plan short & long term... black would like to establish some presence in the center & complete his development & castle the king!
11.  If I win material is this consistent with my plan ...At this point white ""is not concerned"" with blacks pawn on c4 so he does not spend any "" time"" chase after it now!

During my break-time at work a colleague of mine called Beverley mentioned that her daughter Amy was learning how to play chess and had been taking part in some OTB junior tournaments.  I recommended gameknot to Beverley and she told Amy about it.  Amy logged on as snowbun and I challenged her to an unrated game to have some idea about what strength she was at.  So she had her gameknot baptism with me.  She left a piece en prise very early on but played reasonably well after that.  Unfortunately for her I exchanged down so that she had no counterplay whatsoever and my extra piece made itself felt.  I increased my material advantage until she help-mated on move 37.  Gameknot analysis is on the following link:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15060312&rnd=0.6693379831140849. "

Surely c5 or Bb7 is more consistent. c5 is actually the only move in the World database and it scores well for black! Bb7 is in the Gameknot Database. Black isn't really challenging the white centre.
624,29,16,Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/1ppp1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',With a view maybe of a king's side attack and queen side castling.

I wondered how I would break through on the king side with all his pieces guarding key squares but at least I didn't have to worry about any sort of queen's side counter-attack. Nc5 or b5 would have been stronger. Notice how his b6 as well as wasting a tempo is also blocking his queen's path to a5.
634,29,26,1Ng3,b'r1bqrnk1/5pbp/pp1p1np1/3Pp3/4P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q3P/2KR3R b - -',So my more aggresive build up continues.

It did cross my mind that I could have an alternative plan in this position - exchange main pieces down the queen side and then win using my more mobile minor pieces. His Bg7 for instance at the moment has a purely defensive function and is secured blocked by his pawn on e5. However I thought the king side attack was better. I did also consider playing Qf2 round about here with threats of Bb6 picking off his queen. However he can parry this with Rb8 and Rb8 is probably a move he is going to play anyway to help his counter attack. Further with my queen on d2 it prevents him playing h6 which may make it harder for me to open lines on the king side. Furthermore after he plays b4 and I reply N(c3)-e2 my queen pins his pawn on b4 preventing b3. So I decided to keep my queen on d2.
639,29,31,1Nf6d7,b'r1b1rnk1/3n1pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pp3/4P1PP/2NBBPN1/PP1Q4/1K1R3R w - -',Another mysterious knight move! Bringing this knight round to the squares the other knight could have gone immediately..... It is probably the best move in the circumstances.

The thing about Qb3 is I think it anchors his bishop to c8 for now and I have an interesting queen and bishop attack on d5 once both of my knights have made trades on e5.

I ultimately decided on the bishop because my knight already has a good square and I need to get the bishop out. And now that his knight's been chased away I don't have to worry about a trade.
I do have to wonder what I'll do if he plays b5 because now it's guarded by the knight. If he doesn't make that move I may want to play a4 to help keep my knight on c4."

But Ng5 looks like it works out okay because instead of Black being able to get his knight on c6 out of the way I can take it and fork the rooks. And if he ignores the knight I'm capturing on f7 with all kinds of discovered threats.

The great thing about being ahead by two pawns is that I can give one or two back and still not be losing!
But I'm worried about Ne6 which seems to tie everything up even more. So in the end I decided on Bd2 to attack the pawn on e5. But I worry that my queen is guarding the pawn on d3 and the bishop on d2 and if the knight captures on e5 she'll be guarding it too. That's an overworked piece and something he'll take advantage of."

I guess I have to do Qe4 and we trade and I lost my N on e5 to his bishop.
I feel like it's a choice between to Rad1 and then I might be more willing to trade queens and give my knight for two pawns. Or the other choice is a4 so his knight can't go to c5."

I recognize this as a very defensive position for both of us. I want to start playing to prevent him from getting an edge (more than expecting to find a wonderful tactic). I'll use IMPLODES+K to assess this position.
I (initiative) - I've got a little initiative if either of us do but I don't think I have an edge.
M (material) - even
P (Pawn structure) - probably even. We both have a backward pawn to protect.
L (Lines) - even. Our bishops on f4 and f5 control some lines and my Q is a little more useful in this regard than his. But I expect to see Rc2 eventually. Whichever of us ends up controlling the e-file gets the big advantage here. I can imagine Re8 being my next move.
O (Officers - knights & bishops) - looks even. We both have a knight and a bishop that are out of play but I think his knight can get into the game easier than mine.
De (Development) - even
S (Space) - White's got the advantage here.
King Safety - even

I've got to give up the idea of Bxh3 and retreat it to g6. White still has a better position though way better placed pieces."

If I want to blockade it I'm looking at Ne8 and then Nd6 except he can play Qb4 to prevent it.
Another move I'm looking at is Bf7 so it can have an effect on the center but I really like that it's protecting the rook for now.
My rook on e4 doesn't have a better square to go to and it threatens to get behind his pawns at some point and I've got nowhere better at all to put that queen.
Then there's that rook at b8 which really isn't doing anything there. So let's move it to a better square either d8 or c8. "

Let's evaluate:
  Initiative - White's ahead

  Pawn structure - even (or White's ahead)

  Officers  - White's ahead (""officers"" refers to whose knights & bishops are better placed)

The real business starts at move 7 in this project.  Jo is a long-time adversary who has a big plus score against me so I'm glad I took my opportunities here...  
695,32,1,Qe8,b'rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/2p5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',This seems to be the most popular and effective move here though her majesty does get stuck awhile.

However her better opportunity was to bully Black's misplaced R with 24. e5! when the R would either have had to retreat wasting time and giving White's pawns a chance to dominate or give itself up for a pawn.

1.  Is Whites king safe ... Is blacks king safe?
2.  Is material even?
3.  Are there any checks
4.  Are there any unprotected pieces
5.  Is my opponnt threatening something?
6.  Can I threaten something...threat counter threat threat greater threat!

These 6 question all we do is identify these conditions!

White king safe No  Black king Yes
Material ... No whites ahead 1 point
No Checks
White threatens BxBc6... with threatens b4xc5 white threatens to 0-0!
Black threats QxNg5... Bc5xBe4 c5xb4 ...

OK lets use the last 6 questions these are Evaluators so with these we answer to what extent w can do these things!

7.  Can I increase activity of my pieces?
8.  Can I restrict the activity of my opponents pieces?
9.  If I capture material is it consistent with my plan?
10. If my opponent captures material is it consistent with their plan?
11. What is my opponents strategic plan short & long term?
12. What is my strateic plan short & long term?

Well ... black has done a great job so far lets see what the last 6 question tell us to do!

7. Can I increase the activity of my pieces ... Yes ...Qxg5! my Qg5 will have more work ethic
8. Can I restrict the activity of my opponents pieces ... 
look at Qa7 she cannot get back to help her king!
9.  If I capture material is it consistent with my plan?    Yes 
10. If my opponent capture material is it consistent with their plan?  No
11. What is my opponents strategic plan short & long term?  
Get his king safe & free his queen from limbo!!
12. What is my strategic plan short & long term? To prevent my opponent from doing their plan by... getting in their house & messing with thier stuff!!

So...lets see how this works out!  14. ...Qxg5!  15. Bxc6 forced ...otherwise material advantage to black. 1

827,37,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I played e5. I don't often play the sicilian cause e5 suits me better.
