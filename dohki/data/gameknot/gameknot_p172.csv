I prefer 6. Bxf6 because it removes a critical defender of d5 and put the dark bishop on a less active diagonal. The trade off is that I loss the long term advantage of the two bishops. 
1,0,1,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4pb1p/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',the most solid move that keeps the position closed and thus favoring knights. 7. e4 leads to open positions where black can enjoy his two bishops.

42,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Now much of what follows will be easy to understand but a good deal will I think be challenging to more advanced players as well.  Yes there are mistakes here but that's only to be expected.  But this game has some surprising twists in store.
43,2,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Unusual but not bad.  It is one way of developing a Stonewall formation (with e3 and c3 to come).  Black throws in a distraction.
44,2,2,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1Pb1/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',OK but the bishop can be knocked about here.
45,2,3,Be4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PbPP1/7P/PPP1P3/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Easliy repulsed.  Black has spent 3 moves - what we call tempi - on this bishop out of the 4 played.  Better would have been to bring out the knights and having the more pieces in play.  Having said that it's not really clear that White has made the best use of the time given him by Black.  
46,2,4,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PbPP1/5N1P/PPP1P3/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Although this leaves the knight pinned against the rook it is of fairly minor inconvenience to White - hardly worth the time taken to set it up really...
47,2,5,Qd6,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/3p4/3PbPP1/5N1P/PPP1P3/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The purpose of this move is unclear as it isn't easy to see what points in White's camp are sufficiently vulnerable to justify this sortie.  Possibly ...Nf6 or ...Nc6 was called for.  On the other hand Black might have contemplated exchanging on f3.  Normally you wouldn't like that as quite a bit of time has been invested in the bishop.  There again White would be left with a rather messed up K-side.
48,2,6,Nbd2,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/3p4/3PbPP1/5N1P/PPPNP3/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Blocks the protection of the pawn at f4.  Deliberate - or an oversight?  Probably 6.Nc3 was the better choice keeping the pawn protected whilst still threatening to exchange N for B on e4.
49,2,7,Qxf4,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PbqP1/5N1P/PPPNP3/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"(!?) It is usually very risky for the Q to grab a pawn in the opening and so it is here as will be discovered.
"
50,2,8,e3,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PbqP1/4PN1P/PPPN4/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',(?!) Right idea in principle but the pawn is lacking in protection.  Instead 7.Nxe4 Qxe4  8.e3 kept the Black Q out and White's edge in development (activity of pieces number of pieces in play) is roughly worth the pawn deficit.
51,2,9,Qxe3+,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pb1P1/4qN1P/PPPN4/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Obvious and quite good.  But 7...Qg3+ displacing the White King and keeping it in the centre was also worth a look.  Sometimes there's more than one good move in a position.
52,2,10,e6,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3Pb1P1/4qN1P/PPPNB3/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',(?) Now this mistake turns out to be very serious.  An alert Black would be getting pretty concerned about what squares are available to his Queen especially as the happens to be a White bishop staring down the diagonal that is the Queen's only escape route (c1-h6).  Probably  ...Bg6 is already indicated to allow the Queen to retire down the e-file if required.  Black's early raids have netted two pawns.  The trick is to elude the constabulary and make off with the loot.
53,2,11,Nxe4,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PN1P1/4qN1P/PPP1B3/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',(!!)  Well chosen White!  A very fine move.  In the circumstances one might have chosen instead to unmask the battery by 9.Nc4(?)  or 9.Nb3 (?!) winning the Queen!  But the situation is not quite so simple.  After 9.Nb3 Black can bravely contain the damage by 9...Bxf3!  10.Bxe3 Bxh1.  With Rook Knight and 2 Pawns Black will have gained more in value than the Queen lost.  It has to be admitted that White's more active pieces will keep him well in the game.  However with the move played White stands to gain more. Much more...
54,2,12,1Ng5,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3Pq1P1/7P/PPP1B3/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Right notion but an oversight in the execution forgetting that the knight was pinned against the rook.  Now here's a thing that happens a lot in this game.  Both sides are trying to play chess.  This isn't random stuff.  But in planning ahead (White is after that importunate Queen) both sides are apt to forget about what is happening immediately.  This knight move uncovers the vulnerable Rook at h1.  Note that White didn't try the desirable 10.Bd3 as it was an illegal move (the bishop is pinned against the King)!  The right move was 10.0-0! which kept alive both threats (Bd3 and Ng5) by unpinning both pieces at once.  So: 10.0-0 Qg6  11.Ne5 Qf6 (cutting his losses) 12.Rxf6 winning Queen for Rook.
55,2,13,1Qxh1+,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3P2P1/7P/PPP1B3/R1BQK2q w Qkq -',After this Black is 'winning'.  Now in fact he doesn't win.  So how could this move be 'winning'?  The reason is that from here with reasonable (note that I don't say 'best') play Black should win comfortably.  But we all know that slippery gag about the cup and the lip don't we?  The game see-saws violently over the remainder of its course.
56,2,14,1Kd2,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3P2P1/7P/PPPKB3/R1BQ3q b kq -',OK but 11.Bf1 was probably a better defence.  See next note.
57,2,15,1Qg2,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3P2P1/7P/PPPKB1q1/R1BQ4 w kq -',Again OK in that it doesn't hurt Black's advantage but now was an excellent moment to exchange Queens.  Why?  At this point Black is a clear Rook and 2 Pawns ahead - a massive advantage.  Exchanging Queens would have considerably reduced the material in the board whilst at the same time preserving Black's leading margin.  This reduction in material is called 'simplifying' a notion well worth bearing in mind.  In relative terms this margin will have increased in value.  Not only that it means White would have had no Queen with which to come up with some sort of counter-attack.  Not that the lack of a Queen was to deprive Black of chances later in the game...
58,2,16,1Qf1,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3P2P1/7P/PPPKB1q1/R1B2Q2 b kq -',(?) Really in view of what we have learned from my previous note White ought not to have offered the Queen exchange here...
59,2,17,1Qe4,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2N1/3Pq1P1/7P/PPPKB3/R1B2Q2 w kq -',(??) ...and Black ought to have grabbed the opportunity with both hands.  He must  simply have forgotten about the knight on g5 but he certainly overlooked the sudden accumulation of pressure against f7.  There's some amazing things lurking in this position!
60,2,18,1Nxe4,b'rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PN1P1/7P/PPPKB3/R1B2Q2 b kq -',(?) So obvious White probably didn't think twice about it.  But it's not the best - not even close!  After this White gets a useful but moderate advantage.  Instead he could have turned the tables more completely by 13.Qxf7+!! Kd8  14.Qxf8+!! ... (14.Nxe6 forces Black to give up the queen but the resulting material advantage to White amounts to about 1 pawn's equivalent.  He can do better than that!)  14...Kd7   15.Nxe4 dxe4  16.Qxg7+ and the massacre isn't over just yet!
61,2,19,1Bb4+,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PN1P1/7P/PPPKB3/R1B2Q2 w kq -',(?)  It is always useful to look around for 'in-between' moves like this (zwischenzug)  but here it merely means that Black isn't going to get the knight back after all.  13...dxe4 had to be played.  
62,2,20,1Kd1,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PN1P1/7P/PPP1B3/R1BK1Q2 b kq -',(?) Both interpositions (14.c3 and 14.Nc3) were better.  The latter would have preserved the e4-knight.
63,2,21,Nd7,b'r3k1nr/pppn1ppp/4p3/1B6/1b1Pp1P1/7P/PPP5/R1BK1Q2 w kq -',(??) Here 15...c6 would have caused the bishop to relocate leaving Black with a solid position.  Note that 15...Nc6? wasn't much chop as 16.Bxc6+ bxc6 would have disrupted and weakened Black's Q-side (17.Qc4!).  In avoiding that though Black may have incurred worse...
64,2,22,1Qf4,b'r3k1nr/pppn1ppp/4p3/1B6/1b1PpQP1/7P/PPP5/R1BK4 b kq -',(!?) Instead 16.Bxd7+! Kxd7  17.Qb5+ would have forked King and the Bishop at b4.  You'd be surprised how often these little two-move sequences resulting in a destructive fork crop up in chess play.  This isn't the first we have seen in this game...
65,2,23,1a6,b'r3k1nr/1ppn1ppp/p3p3/1B6/1b1PpQP1/7P/PPP5/R1BK4 w kq -',(?) Allowing the exchange on d7 after all.  But at least Qb5+ won't be an option...
66,2,24,1Bxd7+,b'r3k1nr/1ppB1ppp/p3p3/8/1b1PpQP1/7P/PPP5/R1BK4 b kq -',(!) The right move exchanging and decoying the King away from f7.

Here's a possible continuation;  18...Kd6 19.Bf4+ Kd5  20.Qxc7 and mate can't be far off: 20...Nf6 (say) 21.c4+ Kxd4  22.Ke2 (to make way for the a1-rook and to cover the d3-square) 22...e3 23.Qe5+ Kxc4  24.b3#

70,2,28,1Rhf8,b'r4r2/1ppknQpp/p3p3/6B1/1b1Pp1P1/7P/PPP5/R2K4 w - -',(!!) A fine riposte that wins the White rook on a1.  This is a rather unusual though not uncommon type of skewer.  Now skewers generally occur in which an attacked piece is forced to move aside and uncover a weaker undefended piece to be taken. Sort of a 'pin reversed'.  But here it is a vulnerable square that gets uncovered: f1.

With 20...Rf1+ Black would have set up a second 'skewer' forcing the King to uncover his defenceless Rook on a1: 20...Rf1+ 21.Ke2 Rxa1 after which Black would have had slightly the better of it.
72,2,30,Rf2,b'r7/1ppkn1Qp/p3p3/6B1/1b1P2P1/P3p2P/1PP2r2/R2K4 w - -',(?)  Black is playing aggressively which is exactly what is called for in the circumstances.  But he needs to be more alert to what the enemy is doing.  Although less effective than a move earlier 21...Rf1+ was still the best Black had to stay in the game.  But after 21...Rf1+ 22.Ke2 Rxa1 23.axb4 Re8 24.Qxh7 Black would still have been in trouble.

The idea is right but (as so often) overlooks an immediately lethal response.  With 24...Rf8f7 25.Qh8 Rf7f3! White no longer can take the Knight with the Queen.  The game might have continued:  26.Bh4 Rg2(!) 27.Kd2 e1=Q+(!)  28.Kxe1 Rxh3  29.Bf2 ... (essential as Black is threatening Ra1#)  29....Rf3(!!).  Material down Black would have conjured up enough counterplay to give him realistic prospects of forcing a draw.  Try these bishop moves: 30.Bh4 Rh3; 30.Bg3 Rfxg3; 30.Be3 Rxe3+ 31.Kf1 Reg3; 30.Bg1 Rxg1+ 31.Ke2 Rfg3 etc.

The Cunningham defence shows to me a way to restrict the advantage of whites development by building up quite some pressure in the early game. It can force white to give up castling or at least lessen the safety for the king after castling.

That idea had me concerned since it meant my development depended on White's whims. I just had to make it through the Middle Game and duke it out as best I could in the Endgame.
125,5,5,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1nbppp/2np4/2p5/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I almost never castle long as Black in the Sicilian. I made the exception here because I had a Queenside majority (of sorts) to serve as defense. I was also hoping that this way I could most quickly position both my Rooks on the Kingside files and storm the White King's fort.

262,12,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',As it was I simply played what was natural to me as if Black had played d6 instead of e6. I expect the usual pawn trade...
263,12,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',!? But am surprised once again! Obviously my opponent likes to deviate from the norm but that's not to say that this move is ruinous... it does however allow White to take advantage of the fact that d4 pawn hasn't been snapped off yet...
264,12,3,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',..with this move! White advances his pawns to force the Black knight to move once again
265,12,4,Nce7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1pnppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Perhaps Black might have been better with the pawn exchange at this point but the knight would have had to move anyway. This move does not lose the game but the black knight on e7 assist's in Black's loss later on
266,12,5,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1pnppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Checking after the game I find that this game leaves the database with this move the three other alternatives being d6 c4 and dxe6. Perhaps d6 might have been best here to put the cramp in Black's position but that would have been a completely different game from this one.
267,12,6,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1pnp1p/4p1p1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Ignoring the tension in the centre Black prepares a kingside fianchetto with good reason too - the black bishop will have a good scope on the a1-h8 diagonal

With this move I saw that b5 would be a pretty place for my knight. I also note however that it's not an outpost as Black can kick away the knight with a6. However when looking through this line I realise...

I'm pretty sure that most of you reading this have seen this kind of thing before but it was the first time I was able to pull it off! The beauty of it is that there was no way to stop a knight jump to d6 [other than to sac the knight] so even if Black had seen this move the best he could do was 7...Bg7 and even then 8.Nd6! is a powerful move. [and White would have ideas to further ramp up the pressure with a move like Ng5] There is also another beauty in this last position - all the material is still on the board! :) good game!

275,13,2,Nb6,b'2kr1b1r/ppq2pp1/1np1pn1p/4N2P/3P4/6N1/PPPBQPP1/2KR3R w - -',!? A new move for me. I am very familiar with the white side of this opening so I didn't use the chess database at all. Considering my opponent and I are not paying members we were working on our own since move nine. Although it seems we continued with book moves all the way up to move 17!
276,13,3,axb6,b'2k2b1r/1pq2pp1/1pp1pn1p/3rN2P/3P4/6N1/PPP1QPP1/2KR3R w - -',My plan of attack from here was to put as much pressure on Black's weak f7 square and to try to eliminate Black's knight.

279,13,6,b5,b'2k2r2/1pq2pp1/2pbp2p/1p1rN2P/3PQP2/8/PPP3P1/1K1R3R w - -',!? Another interesting move. At first glance it seems to do nothing really. But it actually does two things. First it allows ...Qb6 putting more pressure on my d-pawn. Also Black can undermine my future plans to push my pawn to c3 with ...b4. This could open up my king's defences and keep my d-pawn weak.
280,13,7,2g3,b'2k2r2/1pq2pp1/2pbp2p/1p1rN2P/3PQP2/6P1/PPP5/1K1R3R b - -',Perhaps a waste move I should be stopping Black from having a chance of pushing ...b4!

I played it to prevent him from pressing any of his pawns on the queenside. 27...b6? 28 Qa3! and I could force draw (but I wouldn't) eliminate his pawn at b6 or force a queen trade (which I would love at this point)!
284,13,11,2Qf7,b'3r4/1pk2qp1/2p1p2p/1pQ1Pp1P/5P2/3P2P1/PP6/1K1R4 w - -',! Winning my h-pawn?
285,13,12,2Kc2,b'3r4/1pk2qp1/2p1p2p/1pQ1Pp1P/5P2/3P2P1/PPK5/3R4 b - -',! The best possible move in this position. Now if Black plays 28...Qxh5 I simply reply 29 Qe7+ winning Black's e-pawn.
286,13,13,2Rd5,b'8/1pk2qp1/2p1p2p/1pQrPp1P/5P2/3P2P1/PPK5/3R4 w - -',!
287,13,14,2Qa3,b'8/1pk2qp1/2p1p2p/1p1rPp1P/5P2/Q2P2P1/PPK5/3R4 b - -',?! This was the hardest move of the game for me. I couldn't decide whether to move Qa3 or Qb4. Qa3 has the advantage of supporting the d-pawn and giving the queen access to the a-file which comes in handy for attacking Black's king. Qb4 on the other hand allows the queen the ability to provide protection and support at the d2 square and should the g-pawn fall support the f-pawn. I believe Qb4 is the stronger move.
288,13,15,2Qxh5,b'8/1pk3p1/2p1p2p/1p1rPp1q/5P2/Q2P2P1/PPK5/3R4 w - -',Down falls the h-pawn.

290,13,17,3Rc5+,b'8/1p2Q1p1/1kp1p2p/1pr1Pp1q/5P2/3P2P1/PPKR4/8 w - -',? Doesn't work now!
291,13,18,Qg6,b'8/1p2Q1p1/1kp1p1qp/1pr1Pp2/5P2/1K1P2P1/PP1R4/8 w - -',? With this move Black allowed me to force the draw which I gladly did since I could not see a way to win this game.

297,14,3,1Bd5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/3b4/n2Bpp2/8/1P3N2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Maybe White could have tried to take the e5+f5 pawns for its light-squared bishop trying to put Black's King into a mating net.
298,14,4,e4,b'r1bqk2r/pp4pp/2pb4/5p2/2P1p3/5N2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Here White is simply worse. Now I gain more space threatening White's pieces.

Nb1 (protecting the discovered accack from f8 to a3) Rg6 and after I would attact his Queen with my LSB  check with my Knight on f3 (free meat) He captures my knight and I captore the pawn on f3 checking with the Rook and attacking h1 square... His Queen would have been lost at least I could have exchanged my Rook for it on g3 or somewhere else...
