1,0,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',1......... d5 - the most popular response to the Reti according to the GK database controls e4 and c4.
2,0,2,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',4. ........ c6 - I maintain control of the squares e4 and c4 developing a piece in the meantime.  White backs up his d pawn with e3 and then I take on c4 losing control of that square but there is a possibility of a knight outpost on d5.
3,0,3,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',8. Bd3 - moves bishop back to d3 to try and avoid it being trapped methinks.

8,0,8,1Raxd1,b'r4rk1/1b4pp/p3pn2/1pb1n3/4PB2/1PN5/P1B2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',18. Raxd1 - white is down a piece for a pawn.  I follow the maxim - if up on material exchange.  I therefore exchanged queens.
9,0,9,2Rxd6,b'r4rk1/1b4pp/p2Rpnn1/1p6/4P3/1PN5/P1B2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',20. Rxd6 - more wood is cleared from the board and I maintain my  2 in material.
10,0,10,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1b4pp/p2R1nn1/1p2p3/4P3/1PN5/P1B2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',21. .......... Rac8 - skewering the knight and bishop - white now falls further behind on material.
11,0,11,2Rb6,b'2r2rk1/6pp/1R4n1/1p2p3/4n3/1P6/P4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',25. Rb6 - tries to snatch a pawn back and hoping to gain two queenside passers but my knight has other ideas......
12,0,12,2Nc3,b'2r2rk1/6pp/1R4n1/1p2p3/8/1Pn5/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',25......... Nc3 - defends b pawn and attacks a pawn and rook.  White could save the a pawn by playing Ra1 but he elects to throw in the sponge!

Normally having an advantage in space is not enough to win a game between equals. However this game shows how to exploit a space advantage and convert it into a winning one. Here is the blueprint for doing that. I learned the following from Alec kine and capablanca who were amazing at exploiting the slightest of space advantages

converting an advantage of space into a win

Step 1:
you lock your opponent up. play moves that control more space and constrict your opponent even more. In general avoid exchanges which usually only help your opponent ease his cramped position.

Step 2:
then push him into making a move that creates a weakness. you can do this by squeezing him into such a cramped position that he is forced into playing a move that creates space. However in so he creates an opening for you to breakthrough.
Step 3:
you breakthrough with a sacrifice. Normally this does involve a sacrifice to breakthrough. However open lines for your pieces then that is good too.

There was no hurry to open up the position. After for instance c6 and Be6 keeping a static game it would be clear that black has all the positional advantages. One could always play f5 later after some preparatory moves.
114,3,11,1c5,b'r1bq1r1k/ppp1b1pp/3p4/2PQpp2/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',!  I was only counting on 13.exf5 Bxf5 (c6 might be even stronger) 14.Qxb7 Rb8 15.Qxa7 Rxb2 when black has the better game due to his strong rook on the second rank. With the text move white is fighting back.

As sometimes happens during a normal game of chess I decided to go for this move when I saw a beautiful variation attached to it. This time I also thought it was objectively best since I completely missed white's 16th move. I could definitely have used more time in this critical phase of the game. After 14...f4 there is all to fight for. My feeling is that black is still better in that position.

The attack looked dangerous but I was hoping he would play on. Let's examine the alternatives: 17.Nf7  Rxf7 and now A) 18.Qxf7 Bg4! and black is fine since 19.h3 fails to 19...Bxc5 (or possibly even stronger 19...Be2 20.Rf2 Ba6).  B) 18.Rxf7 Bxc5 Now the point is that on 19.Qc3 black has 19...Qg5 while after the more challenging 19.Raf1 black is fine after he finds the accurate 19...b6! 20.Qc3 Qg8 which keeps the material advantage.

The French is one of those; I love its stable pawn structure and intense queenside play. However I've learned chess ""backwards"" as to what is proper concentrating on opening lines instead of endgame basis and I often lose evenly matched endgames. Part of this is due to my limited ability to calculate long series of moves (as I'm no chess savant) and part of it is a fear of these types of endings (I'm much more comfortable mating in the late-middlegame).  So this is exactly the type of game that I wish I had lost or at least drawn - I made several severe severe endgame blunders that should have cost me the game and I won only because my opponent (who had been playing extremely well) committed a more serious error than mine. In other words a terrible way to win.

The middle game is an excellent (and surprisingly accurate) example of the subdued positional jockeying that branches off into a little used variant of the French Defense at the eighth move. The themes expressed in this game are typical themes of the French: queenside play and a stable center pawn structure by black with a concession of space and development to white.

Black's major plans are to advance the c-pawn to attack whites pawn chain then ...Nc6 and ...Qb6 focusing all play on the queenside.  His light-bishop will obviously be an issue being almost impossible to develop until the late middle-game.  This is a serious pain the ass but not necessarily a major handicap; the conservative nature of the french means that as long as the black e- and d-pawns stand it will be almost impossible for white to break through. 

White's major plans are to defend his own center pawns and mount a kingside attack often after both kings have been castled to opposite corners of the board.  Black can quickly overwhelm the d-pawn in particular so careful play is needed. In the event that the d-pawn falls the linked black center-pawns will eventually constitute a major advantage. In fact these linked pawns are one of the biggest advantages of playing the French for black - these two pawns are often worth more than a rook in the end game (I give up a knight to maintain them in this game) and black's mission is to potect them at all cost!  Eventually the d- and c- pawns will steamroll down the center of the board and promote early. In the event that white manages to shore up his pawn chain effectively black will often sacrifice a knight to mount an attack."

I thought black cannot defend c6 but taking my knight with Bd6xe5. I planned this from the moment I moved my bishop to b5. After this queen exchange is forced since the black knight is pinned. That leaves me with a rook on my d column and his knight is not in a comfortable position: if it goes to h5 it's only plan can be to move f6 allowing to exchange my doubled e5 pawn. I think it would have been the better move for this knight. My counterplay is the weakness of his pawn in e4.

Queen castle is not so important since the b column is open for him. Though he cannot take too much advantage of it. With the castling b2 is defended by my king and if he want to use his pawns to attack it is a long journey and it would be easy for me to defend. 
In order to complement the 13� move's considerations his knight can go to d5 blocking the d column to my rook action (aiming to d8) and threatening an attack on my queen's pawns. But I again can defend it easily with rook d4 that both takes the e4 pawn and prevents Kb4. He can go on with c5 supporting his knight to which I could have answered a3. 
This leaves the time for him to castle but if he does so I would have played rook g1 threatening bishop h6 and planned to advance my h pawn too. I think it would have been his best plan though.

I am a new member of the Sneaky Knights Connection and have completed 12 games so far and scored 7 points.  This is one of the most nailbiting games I have ever played in although it does not quite measure up to the one against Yakky In ""In Old Matey's Shadow Part 2"".  However for a few moves it did look as though I might cop Old Matey.  I will now start with my first move as black.  This is the first time on gameknot that I have played the Scandinavian Defence - I guess I took some inspiration from Chrisobee - he played that opening against me in the annotated game ""Slow King"" and beat me with it so it can't be a bad opening.

Ree8 - the rook is forced back to e8 now the a2 to g8 diagonal is opened - the f pawn is pinned so after an exchange of pawns on the g file my king moves to h8 which becomes more of a prison cell rather than a refuge as the game wears on.

Bd4 - white instantly takes advantage of the situation - I block the diagonal with f6 but unfortunately open up the h2-g8 diagonal next to the king.  The king has no flight squares and my bishop on h7 runs the risk of being pinned.  The air is becoming fetid in his cell Old Matey is peering through the ceiling breathing down me poor ole 'enry's (pet name for my king) neck just waiting to pounce on g7 or h7.  As Bart Simpson would say - ""I'm in trouble deep deep trouble!"""

Qf4 - this move saves the day I think the white dsb is en prise and he moves to e6 - the queen backs off to f5 - she can do this because although the bishop is pinned the queen is defended because if QXQ the pin is released.  White does exchange queens but in a way which gains a tempo and puts the white rook on g4 preparing a deadly line up.

White is well and truly cornered and he waves the white flag.  Wheew!  Don't I get involved in some nailbiters!"

386,15,30,3Rh2,b'8/5pp1/2k4p/ppp3P1/4P2P/1P1RKP2/7r/8 w - -',A return weak move. The rook is far better placed on the other side to help the pawns push forward. Black could simply play hxg4 then having stopped any problems can push forward the a or c pawn

417,17,0,Rh2,b'6R1/p6p/7k/5K2/1B6/P3P2P/7r/8 w - -',Black wants the pawn.  Let's poison it.
418,17,1,3h4,b'6R1/p6p/7k/5K2/1B5P/P3P3/7r/8 b - -',If black takes the pawn he's dead.
419,17,2,3Rxh4,b'6R1/p6p/7k/5K2/1B5r/P3P3/8/8 w - -',Bingo.  Forced mate in two.  It would not have been forced mate if he hadn't taken the pawn.
420,17,3,3Bf8+,b'5BR1/p6p/7k/5K2/7r/P3P3/8/8 b - -',Sir please step away from the pawn.
421,17,4,3Kh5,b'5BR1/p6p/8/5K1k/7r/P3P3/8/8 w - -',Well that about does it.
422,17,5,3Rg5#,b'5B2/p6p/8/5KRk/7r/P3P3/8/8 b - -',Au revoir.
423,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game black deviates from normal lines immediately and pays a heavy price. This game is an instructive game that demonstrates what happens when you move your queen out too early.
424,18,1,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This a blunder. For one it hampers blacks development of the G-Knight. Second this is not the queens ideal developing square. Usually the queens ideal developing squares are c7 e7 d7 or a5. As a rule the queen should be one of the last pieces to be developed
425,18,2,b3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A logical move that allows white to attack e5 from a safe distance.
426,18,3,Nc6,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/4p3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A good move that develops a piece and defends the centre.
427,18,4,Bb5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/1B2p3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is an OK move but lacks an serious threat. I honestly do not see the point especially if black has not plays d7-d6. Also if you are going to play b2-b3 then Bb2 is the ideal follow-up move
428,18,5,Nd4,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/1B2p3/3nP3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This maybe to premature it is usually better to complete your development before you bring your attack.
429,18,6,exd4,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/1B6/3pP3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black has eliminated his only active piece and given up most of his control of the centre.
430,18,7,Bb2,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/1B6/3pP3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',attacking the weak pawn
431,18,8,a6,b'r1b1kbnr/1ppp1ppp/p4q2/1B6/3pP3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',driving away the bishop is a good move
432,18,9,d3,b'r1b1k1nr/1ppp1ppp/p4q2/2b5/3pP3/1P1P4/PBP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Well done black's exchanged has managed to give him a space advantage.
433,18,10,d6,b'r1b1k1nr/1pp2ppp/p2p1q2/2b5/3pP3/1P1P4/PBP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This is a blunder because it traps the dark bishop onto the queen side. better is Ne7 followed by Ne5.
434,18,11,Nh6,b'r1b1k2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1q1n/2b5/3pP1B1/1P1P4/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black could gain a tempo by playing Bxg4 followed by Na6
435,18,12,Bb4+,b'r1b1k2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1q1n/8/1b1pP3/1P1P1B2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',"nope this help white more than it helps black. The check has not real teeth. So why play it! If I were white I would thinking hum black has not real plan. So I can consolidate my position before black figures out what he wants to do. 

Better is Bd7 which develops a piece and prepare for the connect of the rooks after 0-0"
436,18,13,g5,b'r1b1k2r/1pp2p1p/p2p1q1n/6p1/1b1pP3/1P1P1B2/PBPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq g6',Bad move! you should never move the pawn from the side you intend to castle. Black should castle immedaitely
437,18,14,c5,b'r1b1k2r/1p3p1p/p2p1q1n/2p3p1/1b1pP3/1P1P1B1P/PBPN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq c6',black is just wasting time now. Bd7 or 0-0 is better
438,18,15,Rg8,b'r1b1k1r1/1p3p1p/p2p1q1n/2p3p1/1b1pP3/1P1P1B1P/PBPN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w q -',I can understand the fact that black has lauded himself into a false sense of security. However b5 should be played to prevent white from playing Nc4.
439,18,16,1Nc4,b'r1b1k1r1/1p3p1p/p2p1q1n/2p3p1/1bNpP3/1P1P1B1P/PBP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b q -',This is a ideal outpost for the knight

441,18,18,dxe5,b'r3k1r1/1p3p1p/p4q2/2p1p3/1b1pP3/1P1P1P2/PBP3P1/R2Q1RK1 w q -',black has managed to seal the centre. His plan should be to manovure his bishop to the king side where he can attack the king
442,18,19,2g4,b'2kr2r1/1p3p1p/p4q2/2p1p3/1b1pP1P1/1P1P1P2/PBP2R2/R2Q2K1 b - g3',a critical mistake by white. Black can win with the immediately with h5!
443,18,20,h5,b'2k3rr/1p3p2/p4q2/2p1p2p/1b1pP1P1/1P1P1P2/PBP4R/R4QK1 w - h6',Black can play Bc3 to exchange white's dark bishop followed by Qc5 to seize control of the dark squares.
444,18,21,Bd2,b'6rr/1p1k1p2/p4q2/2p1p2p/3pP1P1/1P1P1PQ1/PBPb3R/R5K1 w - -',blunder! drops the bishop.

446,18,23,2Ke2,b'6rr/1p1k1p2/p4q2/2p1p2p/3pP1P1/1P1P1PQ1/P1P1K1R1/R1B5 b - -',...h4 is still playable.

448,18,25,b6,b'7r/3k1p2/pp3qr1/2p1p2p/3pP1P1/1P1P1PQ1/P1PBK1R1/R7 w - -',Black has made many moves that have done little to help him. Ba5 is not real threat because most of blacks pawns are on light squares.

450,19,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',standard but i want a siclian so lets get one.
451,19,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',hm i might get my favorite move
452,19,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',let me get 3....ne5!!
453,19,3,Ne5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p1n2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',nope not !! actually a bad move
454,19,4,Qxc5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2Q5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',well this is a wreck
455,19,5,Nd6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/3n4/5Q2/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',but i recoverd nicely.
456,19,6,b5,b'r1bqk2r/p2pbppp/3np3/1p6/2B5/3Q1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq b6',gotta build up my defence being down the knight
457,19,7,1c4,b'1rb1k2r/p2pbppp/3np3/qB6/2P5/N2Q1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk c3',still trying to win a piece
458,19,8,1Qxd7,b'1r3rk1/p2Qbppp/4p3/qP6/8/1P3N2/P2P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',well i am still down quite a bit and resignation is a thought
459,19,9,2Bc3,b'1r1r2k1/p4p1p/2Q1p1p1/qP4b1/8/1PB2N2/P2P1PPP/1R2K2R b K -',have no choice here but to give him a piece.
460,19,10,Qxa2,b'1r1r2k1/p4p1p/2Q1p1p1/1P6/8/1P3N2/q2B1PPP/1R2K2R w K -',almost didn't see the knight but i saw it and made a different move.
461,19,11,Qa4,b'3r2k1/p4p1p/4p1p1/3r4/q3Q3/5N2/3B1PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',a total blunder. i meant to click a3
462,19,12,2Rb7,b'3r2k1/pR3p1p/4p1p1/3r4/q3Q3/5N2/3B1PPP/5RK1 b - -',um he missed it??
463,19,13,2Qxe4,b'3r2k1/pR3p1p/4p1p1/3r4/4q3/5N2/3B1PPP/5RK1 w - -',well there goes his victory i almost feel bad for it.
464,19,14,Qa4,b'3r2k1/pR3p1p/4p1p1/3r4/q7/5N2/3B1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',snatch and go.
465,19,15,Kg7,b'1R6/p4pkp/3rp1p1/3r2B1/q7/5N2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',there checks are gone.
466,19,16,Rd6d7,b'1R6/p2rBpkp/4p1p1/3r4/q7/5N2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',i got the gun set up i just gotta make sure to spring it right.
467,19,17,Rd5d1,b'4R3/p2rBpkp/4p1p1/8/q7/5N2/5PPP/3rR1K1 w - -',there!
468,19,18,Qxe1#,b'4R3/p2rBpkp/4p1p1/8/8/8/5PPP/4q1K1 w - -',wheew that was a hrd win.
469,20,0,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1n1ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This variation of the Najdorf was first developed by Polugaevsky in the 60s and refined by Gelfand in recent times. It's actually a more solid line than the totally unclear main lines arising after 7...Be7. The positions also get chaotic after 7...Nbd7 but somehow they tend to end up in draws.
470,20,1,b5,b'r1b1kb1r/2qn1ppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w kq b6',The point of the variation. Black gets in b5 one move earlier without Be7. 7...b5 (the infamous Polugaevsky variation) is also playable but that's another story.
471,20,2,1Bxb5,b'r1b1kb1r/2qn1ppp/p2ppn2/1B4B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b kq -',10.Bd3 is the main line. Anand beat Shirov brilliantly with black in Morelia this year in that line. White has other moves as well such as e5.
472,20,3,Ra5,b'1qb1kb1r/3n1ppp/3ppn2/rN2P1B1/5P2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w k -',Armed with my opening database I felt comfortable in this variation as you do need to remember a lot of theory. During the game I was wondering why black could not simply play Bb7. After the game I found out that this move had already been employed by none other than Gelfand against Naiditsch in 2006. That game went 12...Bb7 13.Qe2 fxe5 14.Qc4! and ended with a draw after some complications. I think Bb7 is a better choice if you want to try to win as black but Ra5 is safe enough if you're happy with a draw.
473,20,4,1Bh6,b'1qb1kb1r/3n1p1p/3ppp1B/rN6/5P2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b k -',!  White has j ust gotten his piece back but now he sacrifices it again! This is all theory of course.
474,20,5,1Kb1,b'1qb4r/3nkp1p/3Npp1b/r7/5P2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Necessary as 16.Rhe1 would run into 16...Ne5!
475,20,6,1g3,b'1qbr4/3nkp1p/3Npp1b/r7/5P2/2N2QP1/PPP4P/1K1R3R b - -',?  These positions do not forgive any waste of time. 17.Rhe1 is the correct move when white has enough resources for a draw but nothing more like in Lutz - Gelfand 2002.
476,20,7,1Nxc8+,b'1qNr4/4kp1p/1n2pp1b/r7/5P2/2N2QP1/PPP4P/1K1R3R b - -',This is helping black. 18.Ncb5 was to be preferred but now black has the extra resource 18...Nd5 since there is no rook on e1.
477,20,8,1Rxc8,b'1qr5/4kp1p/1n2pp1b/r7/5P2/2N2QP1/PPP4P/1K1R3R w - -',"The first move in the game I really had to think about as I was now ""out of book"" but the rook capture is quite natural as now black - and not white - gets a strong attack."
478,20,9,1Rhe1,b'1qr5/4kp1p/1n2pp1b/r7/5P2/2N2QP1/PPP4P/1K1RR3 b - -',Loses by force but with a piece up and a strong attack black was winning anyway. Notice that white's g3 move does not bury the black bishop. Black could play f5 and it would find a home in the long diagonal.
479,20,10,Na3+,b'1qr5/4kp1p/4pp1b/r7/5P2/nPN2QP1/P1P4P/1K1RR3 w - -',It was tempting to play Qb4 instead but it doesn't really create any new threats since on Qa3 white would turn the tables with Qb7 . After a while I realized that this idea with the knight sacrifice was just winning by force.
480,20,11,2Kc1,b'1qr5/4kp1p/4pp1b/r7/5P2/nPN2QP1/P1P4P/2KRR3 b - -',Other king moves lead to the same result.
481,20,12,2Nxc2,b'1qr5/4kp1p/4pp1b/r7/5P2/1PN2QP1/P1n4P/2KRR3 w - -',!
482,20,13,Qxb3,b'2r5/4kp1p/4pp1b/8/5P2/1qNK1QP1/r6P/3RR3 w - -',23...Rd8  24.Nd5  Kf8 was also winning but now white gets mated in the middle of the board.
483,20,14,2Ke3,b'3r4/4kp1p/4p2b/5p2/5P2/1qN1KQP1/r6P/2R1R3 b - -',26.Ke5 and the bishop finally enters the game with decisive result. :-)

485,21,0,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',The Milner-Barry (Zurich) variation of the Nimzoindian Defence (E33).  Black's objectives are modest:  avoid the main lines of the Classical variation and set up a solid defence with e5 d6 0-0 and Re8 often conceding the two bishops with Bxc3.
486,21,1,Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This has the drawback of setting up a potential fork after Black pushes his pawn to e5.  A better try is 7 Bd2 avoiding the doubled pawn and bringing the bishop to the a1-h8 diagonal should Black play Bxc3.  
487,21,2,bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/2PP4/2PBPN2/P1Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',8 Qxc3 e5 9 also leads to equality.

A solid alternative is 10 Nd2 aiming for a setup featuring f3 Qf2 Ne4 Rb1 and Ba3 with a very slight edge for White.  Black is equal after White relieves the central tension with 10 dxe5 Nxe5 11 Nxe5 dx35 12 Rd1 Qe7. 
489,21,4,1Ne4,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2PPN3/2PBP3/P1Q2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',The fireworks after 11 Nh7!? peter out to equality:  11 ... Nd7 12 f4 exd4 13 exd4 Nb6 14 Ba3 Qd7 15 Rae1 f5 16 Bxf5 Qxf5 17 Rxe8 Kxh7 18 Qxf5 Bxf5 Rxa8 Nxa8 20 c5.

After 13 ... Nxc4 14 Bxb7 Bxb7 15 Rxb7 Nb6 White will have a rook on b7 that requires immediate protection a dark-square bishop hemmed in by pawns and a weak light square complex (a4 c4 d3 e2 e4 and f3) ripe for exploitation by Black's queen and knight.  More solid is 13 Bh7  Kh8 14 Bd3 c5 15 f3 b6.
492,21,7,1Qf5,b'r2qr1k1/pRp2pp1/1n1p3p/4pQ2/3P4/2P1P3/P4PPP/2B2RK1 b - -',The queen can't defend the rook directly:  16 Qe4 Qd7 (threatening 17 ... f5 and 18 ... Qc6) 17dxe5 Rxe5 18 Qf3 Qc8 19 c4 d5 20 Bb2 Rg5 21 h4 Rg6 22 Rxb6 axb6 - .  So White's only alternative is to keep the Black queen from reaching c6 or c8. 
493,21,8,1Re7,b'r2q2k1/pRp1rpp1/1n1p3p/4pQ2/3P4/2P1P3/P4PPP/2B2RK1 w - -',The logic behind this move should be clear:  to reach c6 the Black queen must first go to e8; so the rook clears that square and defends the c7 pawn.
494,21,9,e4,b'r2q2k1/pRp1rpp1/1n1p3p/5Q2/3Pp3/2P1P3/PB3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Black could have played 17 ... Qe8 18 dxe5 Rxe5 19 Qf3 Rc5 20 c4 Nxc4 21 Bd4 Nd2 22 Qd1 Nxf1 23 Bxc5 dxc5 but it seemed better to maintain positional pressure rather than open the position with wholesale exchanges.  The next few moves decide the fate of the trapped White rook.
495,21,10,Nc4,b'r3q1k1/1Rp1rpp1/p2p3p/Q7/2nPp3/B1P1P3/P4PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Once again Black could have played the straightforward 20 ... Qc6 21 R7xb6 cxb6 22 Qxb6 (22 Rxb6? Rb7- ) Qxc3 23 Bxd6 Rc8 24 Bd5 Re6; but White would have had a protected passed pawn for the exchange and Black's advantage would have been small.  Once again it seemed better to maintain pressure rather than open the position.  20 ... Nc4 is the first in a series of knight forks that ends with the winning of the bishop on the 46th move.
496,21,11,Kh7,b'1Q6/2p1rppk/p1qp3p/8/2nPp3/B1P1P3/P4PPP/1R4K1 w - -',"The White rook has been ""saved"" and White controls the b file; but even though Black has won no material he has a winning advantage.  The file White controls leads to a dead end his bishop is a target hemmed in by pawns the Black king has found a safe haven on h7 the Black queen and knight have occupied footholds in the weak square complex (a4 c4 d3 e2 and f3) and the Black rook is ready to either join an attack on the White king from f6 or g6 or bring additional pressure to bear on the queenside by swinging to a5 or b5 via f5 or g5.  This adds up to a large advantage in mobility one that will become obvious from the speed with which the Black pieces switch from queenside pressure to kingside attack.  White's pieces will remain bottled up with the rook never escaping the 1st rank and the bishop escaping its box only to be lost on d6."
497,21,12,2Qb3,b'8/2p1rppk/p1qp3p/8/2nPp3/BQP1P3/P4PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Slightly better is 24 Qb4 a5 25 Qb3 Nd2 26 Qb5 Qxc3 27 Bb2 Qb4 28 Qxb4 axb4 29 Rc1 d5 30 Rc6 Nc4.

Bb4 would be more effective if the Black rook were still on g6 since then the bishop could only be driven off by 32 ... a5 when 33 a4!? axb4 34 cxb4 would give White at least the hope of counter play in exchange for his piece.  Now however 32 ... c5 33 dxc5 dxc5 34 Ba3 drives the bishop back and opens the d file for Black's queen and rook while allowing Black to maintain his queenside bind.  White  prevents the rook from reaching a5 or b5 but that is more than offset by the increased mobility of the Black queen and Black's control of the d file.

White can abandon his bishop with 35 Qc2 Nxa3 36 Qxe4  Qf5 37 Qxf5  Rxf5 38 Re2 c4- .  Or he can contest control of the d file at the cost of allowing the Black queen to penetrate on the kingside:   35 Rd1 Qg4 36 Rg1 Qe2 37 Qd1 Qxd1 38 Rxd1 Nxa3 once again dropping the hapless bishop.  Instead White pins his hopes on denying the Black queen g4 and bringing his own queen to g3 via b8.

542,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I'm annotating this game at the request of my opponent nathanman22.  Although Black won this game that result was an extremely lucky break.  Earlier in the game I had been in great trouble... I'll try to keep the annotations thematic as far as possible - not too many long variations... Here goes (comments very welcome):
543,23,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White is either aiming for a closed Sicilian or simply trying to cut out some overworked lines by delaying the pawn advance d4.  The plan makes Black think carefully since he doesn't yet know what kind of game will be played.
544,23,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Trying to take advantage of the placement of the bishop on c4.  Because Black's c-pawn has not yet been exchanged for White's d-pawn (as in a normal open Sicilian) there is a potential threat of playing ...b5 and the white bishop can't retreat to its natural square b3 as it would then be trapped by the advance of Black's c-pawn.
545,23,3,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',(?!) In order to address Black's threat of ...b5 5. a4 was called for instead.
546,23,4,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1n1p3/1pp5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',(!) As per the note to Black's fourth move this is better than the immediate recapture of the pawn on d4.  The w-sq bishop is forced back to a much less active position.
547,23,5,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Threatening to win a pawn on the next move with the standard Sicilian mechanism ...b4 which kicks away the knight on c3 whose job it is to defend the e4 pawn.
548,23,6,Qd2,b'r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',(?) The first (of many) mistakes in this game.  Something like 9.f3 would have defended the e-pawn.
549,23,7,Nxe4,b'r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/Np1Nn3/4B3/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',So Black is a pawn up out of the opening.  He must be careful however to complete his development now and not get greedy...
550,23,8,1Qd3,b'r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/Np1Nn3/3QB3/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',(?!) Another reason why White's ninth move was a mistake is that Black captures the e-pawn with tempo attacking White's Queen which has to move again.  However d3 was the wrong square to go to since it allows Black to defend his knight on e4 by opening the Bb7's diagonal at the same time as attacking White's queen - again.
551,23,9,1Qd1,b'r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p3p3/4n3/Np1Nn3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"Heading back where she started but all these queen moves have allowed Black to get quite active quite quickly.  It's so important in the opening (which can be viewed as a race to be the first to get properly developed) not to allow your opponent too many of these ""free"" moves."
552,23,10,1d5,b'r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/Np1Nn3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq d6',The knight on e4 is defended properly and Black gets his liberating ...d5 move with ease.
553,23,11,1Nf3,b'r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/Np2n3/4BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',It seems a shame to have to retreat the knight from its central point on d4 but the threat was ...Qa5 by Black which would have attacked the knight on the edge of the board at a4 -- a piece which has nowhere to go.  By moving the other knight back to f3 White can answer ...Qa5 with Nb6 - since that sq is now covered by the Be3 - instead of being forced to play b3 to defend it.  The move also asks Black what he's going to do about his unsupported knight on e5.
554,23,12,Bxe5,b'r2qk2r/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pb3/Np2n3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',This piece exchange probably doesn't improve White's position.  Now Black is attacking the b-pawn and making it harder for White to play b3 to defend his knight on a4.
555,23,13,1Bb6,b'r2qk2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/3pb3/Np2n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',(!?) an interesting practical decision trying to disrupt the coordination of the Black pieces.
556,23,14,1Qd6,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3pb3/Np2n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black moves his queen out of danger and now threatens to play Bc6 (attacking the knight on a4) and consequent threat of ...Bxa4 followed by ...Qxb6.  White's position is already quite difficult. 
557,23,15,1c4,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3pb3/NpP1n3/8/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq c3',(?!) Although this move isn't quite sound it does force Black to navigate certain dangers as he picks up more material.
558,23,16,1Bxb2,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3p4/NpP1n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',(?) Black goes wrong almost immediately.  Perhaps he was confused by having three different pawn captures available: ...dxc4; ...bxc3 e.p.; and the move played.  Taking the c-pawn en passant would have been the best choice - then there wouldn't have been a DSB en pris on b2 in many variations.  However Black is eying the Ra1...
559,23,17,1c5,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/2Pp4/Np2n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',(!) Making the most of Black's mistake to muddy the waters.  This move has several points: (1) it creates a passed pawn which provides compensation for the lost material; (2) it defends the bishop on b6 so now White is threatening to take the Black bishop on b2 with his knight; and (3) it attacks Black' s queen forcing it to move away from the defence of his own king which soon finds itself under attack.
560,23,18,1Qe5,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Ppq3/Np2n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',There wasn't much else -- Black needs to move his Queen and at the same time defend his bishop.
561,23,19,Qxb2,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Pp4/1p2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White's decision to exchange the Bb2 has brought the Black queen into the heart of the White position.  Together with the knight on e4 this presents a real danger and White must be careful.
562,23,20,1Qa4+,b'r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Pp4/Qp2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',(?) although this is a natural looking move it's actually a mistake.  Safer was Qc1 keeping an eye on d2 and not giving up any more material.
563,23,21,1Kf8,b'r4k1r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Pp4/Qp2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',(?) Black returns the mistake.  Understandably Black wants to get his king as far away from White's pieces as possible.  However ...Ke7 would have been much better (and shown up White's previous error) since it would have covered the crucial d7 square and prevented White's queen infiltrating there.  Had Black found ...Ke7 he would have been in very good shape since he is threatening to capture the Ra1 and also the nasty ...Qd2  (winning the Be2).  If White had continued with 0-0 then Black can play ...Nc3 (or even just ...Qxe2) which forks the Qa4 and Be2 winning further material.
564,23,22,2O-O,b'r4k1r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Pp4/Qp2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',(!) Better late than never.  The difference is that now ...Nc3 does not automatically win material because White will play Qd7 and Black is losing either his Bb7 or Ra8 in return.
565,23,23,2g6,b'r4k1r/1b3p1p/pB2p1p1/2Pp4/Qp2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',(?) A case of chess blindness.  Explained thus: the players had agreed to finish the game in one session from around this point on.  The errors creep up now; though so does the tension.  The simple 20...  Qxe2 was perfectly playable and although Black is losing his LSB after 21. Qd7 his king is in only superficial danger and he would still be a couple of pawns up.  Less good but still okay was 20 ...Nc3.  I had failed to see that the Be2 was immediately capturable and suddenly got anxious about my king. Unfortunately ...g6 doesn't much improve the king's safety but certainly does lose the opportunity of winning material!
566,23,24,2Bf3,b'r4k1r/1b3p1p/pB2p1p1/2Pp4/Qp2n3/5B2/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Moving the bishop out of danger.
567,23,25,2Nc3,b'r4k1r/1b3p1p/pB2p1p1/2Pp4/Qp6/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"(?!) I also considered ...Nd2 but decided it was better to put the knight on a protected square.  Actually either ...Nd2 or ...Qd4 would probably have been better since the move played just encourages the White queen to go where it's already heading.
Generally speaking if Black can stop his king from getting into too much trouble and prevent White's passed c-pawn from getting too far up the board he will be okay.  In practice however it's difficult to deal with both problems at the same time.  White was already threatening to play c6 advancing the pawn and pushing Black's LSB out of play."
568,23,26,2Qd7,b'r4k1r/1b1Q1p1p/pB2p1p1/2Pp4/1p6/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Here I realised that the intended ...Bc8 just loses the rook instead: White would play 23 Qc6 and if the Rook moves to b8 (the only square) then 24. Qd6  wins it on the next move.  So Black consigned himself to losing the Bishop and tried to get his king safe.

571,23,29,Nb5,b'rr6/2Q2pkp/pB2p1p1/1nPp4/1p6/5B2/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Perhaps instead it would have been better simply to capture the a-pawn with the knight -- at least gaining some counter chances with the passed b-pawn.  But Black was nervously trying to chase the White Q out of his position...
572,23,30,Rbc8,b'r1r5/5pkp/pB2p1p1/1nPp4/1p6/5BQ1/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Stopping the pawn's advance for the time being.
573,23,31,2Rfe1,b'r1r5/5pkp/pB2p1p1/1nPp4/1p6/5BQ1/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',With the idea of 27. Qe5  swapping off Queens to an easily won endgame.  Black wants to keep the Queens on the board (even though his king is the less safe) to keep the position complex.
574,23,32,2Nc3,b'r1r5/5pkp/pB2p1p1/2Pp4/1p6/2n2BQ1/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',(?!)  Here in view of what follows ...Nd4 would have been better protecting the e6 sq. and perhaps considering trading White's LSB.

White sees that Black can't take the pawn on c6 with 28...Rxc6 after all since White would simply play 29. Bd4 and Black is getting checkmated on g7.  Because White is going to play 29. Bd4 anyway Black must find a way to defend.  It was only now that I began to appreciate how dangerous White's attack was.
576,23,34,2Rcf8,b'r4rk1/5p1p/pBP1p1p1/3pQ3/1p6/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',The safest thing would have been to give up the knight to get the queens off the board with 28...Ne2 .  However practically speaking this would have lost in the long run also so Black decided to continue to live on the knife edge.
577,23,35,f6,b'r4rk1/7p/p1P1ppp1/3pQ3/1p1B4/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Forced.  Black must defend against the threat of mate.

579,23,37,3Bxf6+,b'r4r2/6kp/p1P1QBp1/3p4/1p6/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',(?) White is a little too keen to get at Black's king.  His attack is easily winning so there's no need to rush things with this move.  After Black recaptures he will face sustained pressure it is true but the fact that material is now level again means that for example it becomes okay for Black to seek the exchange of Queens.  Perhaps White got the move order confused since 31.Qe7  first would have been good.  Then if 31...Rf7 32. Bxf6  would have been possible since the Rf7 is pinned to the king on the 7th rank.
580,23,38,Rf6,b'r7/6kp/p1P1Qrp1/3p4/1p6/2n2B2/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Here Black offered a draw - more in hope than anything else - after this mini repetition of position.  White rightly turned down the draw since his position is clearly strategically better but Black is still in the game.
581,23,39,Rf7,b'r7/5rkp/p1P3p1/3p4/1p6/2n2B1Q/Pq3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',There's nothing better than this - to stop the c-pawn's advance.  White now needs to find an infiltration point and this has its challenges since the obvious c-file (behind his passer) is blocked by Black's N.
582,23,40,3Ref1,b'r7/5rkp/p1P3p1/3p4/1p6/2n2B1Q/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',(?!) But it can't be right to take the R off the open file.   White wants to be able move his Bf3 without worrying about ...Qxf2  supported by the Rf7 but better was Qg3 planning to advance the h-pawn and break open Black's king.  Then in response to the cheeky 35...Re8 (hoping for Rxe8?? ...Qxa1  mating White's king) White can play 36. c7 or 36. h4 since it's not in Black's interests to exchange Rooks on the e-file..  However it is actually surprisingly hard for White to make real progress in this position (though during the game I believed I was busted).
583,23,41,3a5,b'r7/5rkp/2P3p1/p2p4/1p6/2n2B1Q/Pq3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',(?!) aiming for ...a4 and ...b3 but 35...Re8 would have been much more active.  In that case it's almost equal.
584,23,42,Qd2,b'r7/5rkp/2P3p1/p2p4/1p6/2n2BQ1/P2q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black was looking at ideas of ...Rxf3 and then ...Ne2  forking Qg3 and Kg1.  At present this doesn't work: White just plays gxf3.  Black tries to centralise his Q and clear the b-pawn's path while he waits for concrete action by White.
585,23,43,Kg8,b'r5k1/5r1p/2P3p1/p2pQ3/1p6/2n2B2/P2q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',(?) Played automatically but the k is safer on h6.  White now finds an excellent Rook sacrifice to force the breakthrough...
586,23,44,3Rad1,b'r5k1/5r1p/2P3p1/p2pQ3/1p6/2n2B2/P2q1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',(!!)  The idea is to divert the Nc3 then clear the Black q's protection of the d-file allowing Bxd5 with a vicious pin on the Rf7 (this idea would not have worked if the Black king were on h6).
587,23,45,3Nxd1,b'r5k1/5r1p/2P3p1/p2pQ3/1p6/5B2/P2q1PPP/3n1RK1 w - -',Black is required to accept the sacrifice.

590,23,48,4Bxd5,b'r5k1/5r1p/2P3p1/p2BQ3/1p6/8/q4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',(!) Played anyway.  White sees that Black gets the f2 pawn but no more.
591,23,49,4Kh1,b'r5k1/5r1p/2P3p1/p2BQ3/1p6/8/5qPP/3R3K b - -',Amazingly despite being the exchange and a pawn to the good Black is losing in all variations.  Now best was ...Qf5 offering a trade of queens but Black's pinned Rf7 gives White the best of any tactics.
592,23,50,4Raa7,b'6k1/r4r1p/2P3p1/p2BQ3/1p6/8/5qPP/3R3K w - -',Trying to stop the c-pawn ineffectively.  Now White has the crushing 42. c7! and Black would be only a move or so away from resignation.  Black must take the pawn since if ...Ra8 - to stop the c-pawn queening not Bxa8?? (since that unpins the Rf7 and allows ...Qf1 mating White) but simply 43. Bxf7  followed by 44. Rd8  winning).  However ...Raxc7 would nevertheless have been answered by 43. Qxc7 - that pinned rook on f7 can only look on - and White will emerge a queen up - or get mate - after taking on f7 with the Bd5.
593,23,51,4Bxf7+,b'6k1/r4B1p/2P3p1/p3Q3/1p6/8/5qPP/3R3K b - -',(?) Going wrong at the crucial moment.  After this the position should be drawn since Black is a pawn up but the advanced White c-pawn keeps the balance.
594,23,52,Rf8,b'3R1rk1/7p/2P3p1/p3Q3/1p6/8/5qPP/7K w - -',Now in this simplified position things start to unravel for White.  He needed to be thinking about how to hold the draw but that calls for an extensive psychological adjustment since only a few moves ago he was completely won.
595,23,53,4Qe6+,b'3R1rk1/7p/2P1Q1p1/p7/1p6/8/5qPP/7K b - -',A slight innacuracy.  White needed to trade rooks and go in for a variation where he gives up his c-pawn for Black's a- and b-pawns.
596,23,54,4Kg7,b'3R1r2/6kp/2P1Q1p1/p7/1p6/8/5qPP/7K w - -',Black has the benfit of certain tactics involving White's back rank and this helps him wriggle out of the checks.
597,23,55,4Qe7+,b'3R1r2/4Q1kp/2P3p1/p7/1p6/8/5qPP/7K b - -',(?) A (natural) mistake which Black fails to exploit.
598,23,56,4Qe5+,b'3R4/5rkp/2P3p1/p3Q3/1p6/8/5qPP/7K b - -',Now amazingly 46...Qf6! would have won for Black.  In that case he would threaten the White queen and White rook on d8 AND mate on f1 so White would have been forced to exchange queens.  But after 47. Qxf6 ....Rxf6 Black's continued mating threat on the back rank means that after White defends (e.g. with 48. g4) Black is free to capture the pawn on c6 when his passed Q-side pawns will decide the game in his favour. 
599,23,57,4Kh6,b'3R4/5r1p/2P3pk/p3Q3/1p6/8/5qPP/7K w - -',(?) missing the win.  I was in truth so relieved to be in drawing territory once again that it never occured to me I might have something better.
600,23,58,Qf1+,b'3R4/5r1p/2P3pk/p3Q3/1p6/7P/6P1/5q1K w - -',47...Rf5 would have been better guarding the a-pawn.  Black was too keen to give a check himself for a change.
601,23,59,Qc1,b'3R4/5r1p/2P3pk/p3Q3/1p6/7P/6PK/2q5 w - -',Keeping the c-pawn in check. This position should be drawn as White can't get his pawn forward and both sides have certain perpetual check ideas with queens still on.
602,23,60,4Rd4,b'8/5r1p/2P3pk/p3Q3/1p1R4/7P/6PK/2q5 b - -',(!) A split second before I got ready to capture the c6 pawn (which I thought White had forgotten to protect) I noticed that 50. Rh4   would be mate!

605,23,63,Kd5,b'8/5r1p/R1P3p1/3k4/1p6/7P/6PK/8 w - -',Both sides are guilty of being overambitious in this ending.  53...Rc7 was simple and good.  Black is trying to walk his b-pawn down the board with his king.
606,23,64,5c7,b'5r2/1RP4p/6p1/2k5/1p6/7P/6PK/8 b - -',Now Black must be very careful.  Trying to dislodge the White rook with ...Kc6 loses to Rb8! and after 57. Kxc7 (otherwise the pawn queens) Rxf8 is winning for White as Black's b-pawn isn't quick enough.
607,23,65,Kd5,b'2r5/1RP4p/6p1/3k4/1p6/6KP/6P1/8 w - -',(!)  Finding the right plan at last.  57...Kc4 with the idea of shephearding the b-pawn home can lead to disaster: White gets to d7 with his king and forces Black to give up rook for the c-pawn then he gives up his own rook on b2 or b1 for Balck's b-pawn and in the meantime sends his king over to the k-side to munch the Black pawns.  Black's move keeps the W king out of the queenside.
608,23,66,h6,b'2r5/1RP5/6pp/3k4/1p3K2/7P/6P1/8 w - -',Now this move to keep the White king out of g5.  Black's idea is that he will push his b-pawn force White to take it with his rook - thereby unprotecting the c-pawn - and allowing ...Rxc7.
609,23,67,5Rxb4,b'2r5/2P5/6pp/3k4/1R3K2/7P/6P1/8 b - -',There's nothing better.  White could try to play g4 and g5 but Black will play ...h5 and White can't force the win of the K-side pawns.
610,23,68,6Re5+,b'8/2r5/4k1pp/4R3/5K2/7P/6P1/8 b - -',Now White is guilty of trying too hard.  Psychologically it's hard to accept a draw when you know you missed a win earlier but it was time to sue for peace.  This position is a dead theoretical draw.  Which is to say that neither side can force a win; the only winning chances are presented by unforced errors.  The Rook being on e5 presents certain tactical opportunities...  Instead 61 Rb6  ...Kf7 and there's no way for White to make progress.
611,23,69,Kf6,b'8/2r5/5kpp/4R3/5KP1/7P/8/8 w - -',By this move Black is demonstrating there's no way for White to continue safely.  Black offered a draw again here but White still can't let go of his delusions of winning...
612,23,70,6h4,b'8/2r5/5kpp/4R3/5KPP/8/8/8 b - -',(??) A horrid blunder and as they say the last mistake.  White needed to realise his K and R are precariously placed: a Black check on the 4th rank is going to cause problems since White's rook is attacked by Black's king.
613,23,71,6g5+,b'8/2r5/5k1p/4R1p1/5KPP/8/8/8 w - -',(!) Taking his chance!  The immediate 63...Rc4  achieves nothing because after 64 Re4 the rook swap on e4 doesn't dislodge White's king far enough.
614,23,72,hxg5+,b'8/2r5/5k2/4R1p1/5KP1/8/8/8 w - -',Perhaps in this position White had intended 65. Rxg5 and then saw that after 65...Rc4  he loses his rook on g5 for nothing.
615,23,73,6Ke4,b'8/2r5/5k2/4R1p1/4K1P1/8/8/8 b - -',Now however the check on c4 is deadly.
616,23,74,6Kd5,b'8/8/5k2/3KR1p1/2r3P1/8/8/8 b - -',Wanting to maintain protection of his Re5.  Other moves also lose: (66.Kd3 ...Kxe5 67. Kxc4 ...Kf4 etc.)
617,23,75,6Rc5+,b'8/8/5k2/2rKR1p1/6P1/8/8/8 w - -',(!) Dislodging the W King away from the protection of his last pawn.  White must have missed this diversion tactic.  
618,23,76,Kxe5,b'8/8/8/2K1k1p1/6P1/8/8/8 w - -',Now White loses his g-pawn and can't get back in front of Black's g-pawn to stop it queening.  Around here White finally decided that a draw would be a fair result and offered one.  However Black is no longer willing to share the point.
619,23,77,Kg2,b'8/8/8/6p1/8/8/4K1k1/8 w - -',Black keeps the White king out.  There's no way to stop the pawn queening.
620,23,78,Kh2,b'8/8/8/8/8/6p1/7k/4K3 w - -',"Here White resigned.  Black plans just ... g2 and ....g1=Q on his next two moves regardless of White's replies.

A very hard fought game. The final result didn't really reflect the course of the struggle (first Black then White should have won; and afterwards a draw would have been a fair outcome) but it does offer a valuable lesson that you must always consider your position objectively - playing on in a drawn position can occasionally backfire horribly.  Thanks to nathanman22 for this exciting encounter!  Any comments welcome."

658,25,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"This game is one of my favorites for several reasons.  The first is the fact that I found my longest forced mating line to date (March 2008) in this game an 18-ply forced mate at move 14 (which ended up being only 9 ply in practice but the game was over regardless).  The second is the quick way my attack springs into action in response to several subtle (and not so subtle) errors by my opponent.  The third is due to a fundamental aspect of the game; my opponent's defense crumbles rapidly for positional reasons mostly due to self-inflicted weaknesses in his pawn-chain.  

Pawn maintenance is increasingly my dominant consideration during play although I still have pawn chains implode from time to time.

The primary lesson to take from this game is one of pawn-structure management. Changes in your pawn structure are not to be made lightly - an entire chain of pawns imploding upon itself
is an ugly sight (I've had this happen to me more often than I care to recall) - and even successful changes mean a long term shift in the positional requirements of future play.  Pawn structure maintenance is increasingly my dominant consideration during play although I am still pretty pitiful at it. As a general rule of thumb you should probably ponder over pawn moves at least twice as long as you ponder over a piece move. On another note let go ahead and disclose to you that I didn't exactly outshine my opponent in pawn play this game - mine leaves quite a lot to be desired and I probably would have been sunk had my opponent not made a few critical errors.

Another lesson to take is one about development. Asymmetrical development can be a weapon - learn how to capitalize on your advantages and use spare tempo to control the pace of the game!

Note the bottleneck that the knight on e7 causes - its choking the mobility out of both the queen on d8 and the bishop on f8.

This tiny little pawn move seals black's fate. White has four developed and attacking pieces whereas black has only one piece developed beyond its original square - where it does more harm blocking his own development than any defensive good! Moreover it further weakens the only stable black pawns on the board.  White's pieces can now flood into the black camp unopposed by any pesky defensive pawns while the black pieces are unable to coordinate because of a lack of space.

Three general rules of thumb: 
Don't move too many pawns during the opening or you're likely to face a massive attack.
 
Aways consider pawn moves VERY carefully - little pawn moves have huge long term positional strategic and tactical ramifications. 

Use pawns to deny enemy knights forward positions; use pawns (carefully!) as a prophylactic against knight attacks.  There are few things worse than one (or god forbid two!) knights operating behind your pawn structure and the more pawn moves you make the more inroads into your position you open.

The most important piece of hard-won chess knowledge I've gained thus far is this: always set up a pawn structure you are comfortable with (open or closed) in the first few moves then develop around this structure. I'm progressively favoring more conservative pawn structures that will defend themselves - the French Defense has become my favorite opening to play as black since black's pawns require little attention or maintenance.

Fatal to White here (other than missing the free queen which would also have  lead to a captured knight at least) was the premature attack against Black's King. With just the knight white was able to fork the rooks but Black's response not only won back the material it also enabled strong pressure on White's King putting it on the defensive almost the entire conclusion of the game.

Black decides to probe and see what White does.

Black feels that immediate attempts to tie up the bishop by Bf7 and then invade with the king can be frustrated by a timely g4!?.

But it will allow the knight to be placed in c6 eventually and then everything will have been going back after the black pawn's advance. Or I think so. I still wonder if I were right.

I play d5 to cut off his white bishop as much as anything else.  he is probably going to move the knight to e7 and keep it in the center since a7 doesn't leave a retreat path for his black Bishop.
