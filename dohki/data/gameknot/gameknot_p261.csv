I don't always follow the ""correct"" order when playing an opening but sometimes that order exists to avoid traps.  Neglecting f3 allows 7...Ng4 threatening to exchange for the bishop.  On the other hand I've fallen into a counter-trap with 7. Bc4 Ng4 8. Bb5  Bd7 9. Qxg4 so it pays to be careful from both sides."

It does open half-open the f-file which can be dangerous when directed toward a castled position but there are always tradeoffs and I think it's manageable especially since my bishop will complicate castling for white.  The exchange also helps continue development which never hurts.

Odd that I mention the endgame when we've barely left the opening.  I don't think there's any clear demarcation between phases but as pieces are traded off threats against the king are reduced and play begins to revolve around pawn promotions instead of direct mates.  In this case white is out of threats against black and black's king can start eyeing the path to the center of the board."

After recalculating and planning to change opposition I realized I couldn't force my king to a3 and offered a draw.

When reviewing I was struck by the fact that white never made any serious mistakes.  There are a few places I would have played differently to obtain a different position after an exchange but other than the lost pawn at the beginning the game result was decided on positional play and my blunders.  The best advice I can offer is to centralize pieces when possible and double check any moves before submitting them.  :)

Scartando il scarificio per ora l'idea � fare pressione su d6 quasi obbligando la torre ad andare in d8.

E se il nero fa e5?
Un'altro mondo...

The Wicked Witch of the West is en prise so she moves to e3 forking a and e pawns.  To avoid losing a pawn my bishop takes on b2 to break up white's queenside pawns.

The best white can now do is give up the exchange by backing off the rook from a7 to a1.  I now collect  the two material points over the next two moves.

Rxe1 - after a bit of shilly shallying over the last few moves I am glad to exchange off one pair of rooks - now it really is rook and pawn against a knight.  I should have been confident of winning this one but my opponent was more than 200 points north of my rating and this is only the second time in my entire life that I have beaten an 1800  player.  The last time this happened was 10 years ago when I had a BCF rating of 80 (Elo 1240) and my opponent's was BCF 153 (Elo 1824)!  So this was very nerve wracking especially as I had to watch where I put my rook and my king to evade dastardly knight forks.

363,19,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Leading to quick castling.

365,19,3,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I was wanting to castle early as well but I eventually delayed castling to the proper moment.
366,19,4,h3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',My first thought was he was planning on storming my kingside with a pawn storm with Bishop and Queen support. While I had a half-open c file I was starting to consider queenside castling.
367,19,5,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Put the question to the knight. It is too important of a square to leave the knight unmolested for long.
368,19,6,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/1B6/3NP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Yet another Bishop move. He will make several Bishop moves over the course of the game. 
369,19,7,Bd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/1B6/3NP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I wanted to maintain my pawn structure without having to move my queen around unnecessarily.
370,19,8,bxc6,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/1B6/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I had considered exchanging the bishops off and having the pawn end up on c6 in the end but I decided to harass the Bishop some more. I would use the extra tempo to develop and establish control over the center. 
371,19,9,Nxe4,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2ppp3/8/2B1n3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Here I noticed that I could have played the pawn fork had White taken the knight. My queen was not in danger since my rook was covering the back rank and he had not developed his dark squared Bishop yet.
372,19,10,Nf6,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/8/2B5/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I had considered exchanging off the knights but I wanted to keep the piece for the time being until I could develop another advantage or two. Numerous books have suggested the way of winning games was to accumulate little advantages so I decided to go along the same path.
373,19,11,1Qd3,b'r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/8/2B5/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Back to lining up against the kingside and opening up the backrank to bring his A1 Rook into play after moving his Bishop. I saw that once he done that the b pawn would hang but I did not want to go pawn hunting with my king in the middle.
374,19,12,1a5,b'r2qk2r/3bbppp/2pppn2/p7/2B5/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w kq a6',My plan at this point was to limit the scope of his Queenside while leading up to the pin of the knight in the likely event he would move his A file rook to E1.
375,19,13,d5,b'r2qk2r/3bbppp/2p1pn2/p2p4/2B5/P1NQ3P/1PP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',I decided to harass the Bishop with a gain of tempo while simulataneously acquiring more space in the center. I knew that if I over-reached myself it would become a potential target so I decided to play things slowly.
376,19,14,Qc7,b'r3k2r/2qbbppp/2p1pn2/p2p4/8/P1NQ3P/BPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Now leaving up the option of connecting both rooks once I castled while preparing for the E pawn advance. My plan was to chock the life out of White with gains in space.
377,19,15,1g3,b'r3k2r/2qbbppp/2p1pn2/p2p4/8/P1NQ2PP/BPP2P2/R1B2RK1 b kq -',An unnecessary weakening of the pawns in front of the kingside. I knew that if I could somehow pin the F pawn I could take the pawn on g3 with check. This became a long term plan. But first I would have to castle and then open up the center files for my rooks. White still had not developed his dark squared Bishop at this point. I think he was trying to figure out what exactly I was going to do with my king first before committing to an attack.
378,19,16,1Kg2,b'r3k2r/2qbbppp/2p2n2/p2pp3/8/P1NQ2PP/BPP2PK1/R1B2R2 b kq -',To protect the pawn. It was not a potential target at this time so this was sort of a waste of time. Development was more important.
379,19,17,d4,b'r4rk1/2qbbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/3p4/P1NQ2PP/BPP2PK1/R4R2 w - -',I knew this opened up the diagonal for the Bishop on A2 but I intended to attack the Knight and possibly opening up the B file for my rooks. Upon reflection this move was not a good idea. Better perhaps was h6 putting the question to the Bishop and removing the pawn from the Queens line of site.
380,19,18,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/2qb1ppp/2p2b2/p3p3/3pN3/P2Q2PP/BPP2PK1/R4R2 b - -',This was another potential downside to moving the D pawn. Now my center was grossly extended. 
381,19,19,1Be6,b'r4rk1/2q2ppp/2p1bb2/p3p3/3pN3/P2Q2PP/BPP2PK1/R4R2 w - -',My plan was to move both the g pawn and the f pawn to the right one file with the exchanges. I had the possibility of moving my King to H8 if the White queen moved to the kingside for a spite check. I figured that if White would exchange my Bishop for his Knight he would have wasted several tempo to do so. Another thought that weighed in allowing the exchange was the fact it would open up the g file for my Rook lining up against the White King. 
382,19,20,2Bb1,b'r4rk1/2q2p1p/2p1bp2/p3p3/3p4/P2Q2PP/1PP2PK1/RB3R2 b - -',This move made no sense to me. He wanted to save his Bishop for a potential King side attack along with the Queen. I knew that I had time to get the pawns in front of my King into position where my Queen could cover the H pawn.
383,19,21,dxc3,b'r4rk1/2q2p1p/2p1b3/p3pp2/8/P1pQ2PP/1P3PK1/RB3R2 w - -',I knew he would not sac his Queen for the pawn so I would tie up White with the pawn exchange. Now I had my open D file for my rooks with the Queen right in the middle. If nothing else I would gain some tempos with the Rooks against the Queen.
384,19,22,Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/2q2p1p/2p1b3/p3pp2/8/P1PQ2PP/5PK1/RB3R2 w - -',It was a matter of taste which Rook to move first. I wanted to the A file Rook to cover that file till I was ready.
385,19,23,Rd6,b'r5k1/2q2p1p/2prb3/p3pp2/8/P1P3PP/2Q2PK1/RB3R2 w - -',Even if White moved his C pawn I would have both of my Rooks on this file first. I still controlled the center which turned out to be a long term plus.
386,19,24,2Qc3,b'3r2k1/2q2p1p/2prb3/p3pp2/2P5/P1Q3PP/5PK1/RB3R2 b - -',Attacking the unprotected pawn. However I had the resource in place to protect with my doubled pawn. One of the few times a doubled pawn could be some benefit.
387,19,25,2Ba2,b'3r2k1/2q4p/2prbp2/p3pp2/2P5/P1Q3PP/B4PK1/R4R2 b - -',Now White is thinking about the skewer against my King. Instead of allowing the exchange to happen on e6 I would move it back f7. But first I would have to deal with the attack on my Rook.
388,19,26,2Rd6d3,b'3r2k1/2q4p/2p1bp2/p3pp2/2P5/P1Qr2PP/B4PK1/R4R2 w - -',I am still eyeballing the G pawn. This move was to gain a tempo and allow for both of my Rooks to come into Whites camp with them lining up against White's kingside.
389,19,27,Rd8d3,b'6k1/2q4p/2p1bp2/p3pp2/2P5/P2r2PP/B2r1PK1/R1Q2R2 w - -',Now the pieces are in place to attack the kingside. All I would have to do now is to move my E pawn.
390,19,28,3Re1,b'6k1/2q4p/2p1bp2/p3pp2/2P5/P2r2PP/B2r1PK1/R1Q1R3 b - -',Giving himself a little breathing room for his King. I would also be a bluff of an attack against the center. Had White an extra tempo he could have played c3 but the pin prevented that.

395,19,33,Rg3+,b'6k1/7p/2p1bp2/p4p2/2P1p3/P5rq/3r1P2/RBQ1R1K1 w - -',Here White resigned in light of the mate on next move following 34. fxg3 Qg2  .
396,20,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Illger after f5 enters into a backward Sicilian he must attack the king side eventually with his queen Qe1-h5 he did not!

This game was played on Gameknot. 
418,22,1,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I think that my opponent was not extremely familiar with the Budapest as he spent a lot of time in almost all subsequent moves. 
419,22,2,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3... Ne4 is also an interesting move. With Ng4 black intends to regain the pawn but Ne4 intends fierce battle.
420,22,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A clear threat on f2. 5. e3 is pretty much forced and the black bishop has a harder time getting developed. In addition to speeding his development with the gambit black also inhibits White's development. 
421,22,4,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P3n1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',White cannot save the e5 pawn the only try Qd5 fails to Qe7.

So although this move doesn't actually develop a piece it was probably the best available since it hinders White's development (although at the expense of a pawn).
