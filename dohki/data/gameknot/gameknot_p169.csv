9,1,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',White pushed the game into Gloria variation. I've rarely met this variation so I decided to follow the book strictky or at least as far as I could.

You lose a turn to bring your bishop ahead and then exchange it for a undeveloped knight. Additionaly he allows my black squared bishop to open his diagonal and threaten c3 and put pressure on b2 and a1

41,3,0,Bxf2+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Traxler Counter-Attack - one of the sharpest openings in chess. The variations are still 'unclear' in many lines - despite all the software available nowadays for analysis. It is a particularly dangerous weapon in over-the-board tournament games; provided Black is prepared to specialize in its use. I've included the game here so that I can link to it in my blog.
42,3,1,Kxf2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ3R b kq -',A bit risky: However this was an unrated game and was more like a discussion. Safer is 6.Kf1.
43,3,2,Kg1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ2KR b kq -',Other moves have been tried and each brings White unique problems but which all share the a common theme - the exposed nature of the king.
44,3,3,Nxh8,b'r1b1k2N/pppp2pp/2n5/4p3/2B4q/6n1/PPPP3P/RNBQ2KR b q -',In the Traxler - it's not about material - its all about tempo and space - or the lack of it.
45,3,4,d5,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/2B4q/6n1/PPPP3P/RNBQ2KR w q d6',Again - tempo: Black wants to 'clear the decks' of any driftwood. He need the c8 bishop and the remaining rook to join the attack without further delay - absolutely nothing else matters. If he dithers for even a single move - then White will consolidate - perhaps giving back a little of the material - but will definitely win. 
46,3,5,1Qf3,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/2B4q/5Qn1/PPPP3P/RNB3KR b q -',But White also is well aware of the real agenda and so he also doesn't miss a chance to develop a piece.
47,3,6,Nxh1,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/2Bq4/4Q3/PPPP3P/RNB3Kn w q -',The queens are destined to disappear and Black is forced to recoup some of the material.
48,3,7,1Bb3,b'r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/3n4/1B6/PPPP3P/RNB3Kn b q -',13.Bxd5 would lead to still further complications because after 13...Nxc2 14.Nf7 Black is not obliged to immediately capture the a1 rook
49,3,8,1Na3,b'r3k2N/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/3n4/NB5b/PPPP3P/R1B3Kn b q -',A critical decision. On the positive side Na3 develops a piece in a position where this is clearly a major priority. On the other hand it appears to be insufficient: The game continuation suggests that Black is beyond equality and may even already hold a telling advantage.
50,3,9,Kd7,b'r6N/pppk2pp/8/3pp3/8/NP5b/1PPP3P/R1B3Kn w - -',[!] Castling queen-side achieves a similar result [bringing the a8 rook into the game] but is not just as strong because the king on c8 would be further removed from the action. Black needs every single piece involved in the game and so the text is strongest. The e7 square is avoided because of a potential tempo-gaining check by a later Bg5.
51,3,10,Rf8,b'5r1N/pppk2pp/8/3pp3/8/NP1P3b/1PP4P/R1B3Kn w - -',[!] On another internet site an analyst only considers 16...Rxh8. but again - the Traxler is all about tempo. Getting the rook to the f-file at once is I think stronger than pausing to pick up the piece.
52,3,11,d4,b'5r1N/pppk2pp/8/4p3/3p4/NP1PB2b/1PP4P/R5Kn w - -',And from this point onwards White's problems increase: Black's compensation includes extra pawns and since he already has a bishop controlling the light squares the pawns do a very good complimentary job with the central dark squares.
53,3,12,1Nc4,b'5r1N/pppk2pp/8/4p3/2Np4/1P1PB2b/1PP4P/R5Kn b - -',[!] This is the best chance - but it is I think already too late.
54,3,13,Ke6,b'5r1N/ppp3pp/4k3/4N3/8/1P1Pp2b/1PP4P/R5Kn w - -',And so the king insists on getting involved as well.
55,3,14,Nf2,b'5r2/ppp2Npp/4k3/4N3/8/1P1Pp2b/1PP2n1P/R5K1 w - -',As luck would have it - the knight which seemed all but doomed - now escapes.
56,3,15,Bf5,b'5r2/ppp3pp/8/4kbN1/8/1P1Pp2P/1PP5/4R1K1 w - -',White's bad luck continues: Taking the e3 pawn runs into Kf4 attacking both rook and knight.
57,3,16,Rf6,b'8/ppp3pp/5r2/4kbN1/8/1P1Pp2P/1PP3K1/4R3 w - -',Increasing the scope of the rook still further.
58,3,17,2Ng1,b'8/ppp3pp/5r2/5b2/5k2/1P1Pp2P/1PP3K1/4R1N1 b - -',At this point White offered to resign but sportingly allowed a nice finish. You see these two pieces - White's g1 knight and Black's queen's rook - have been mortal enemies in the Traxler for a very long time: The knight began its journey from g1 and captured the rook's colleague some time ago and has now returned home again. But guess who is waiting to meet him. 
59,3,18,Rxg1,b'8/ppp3pp/8/5b2/5k2/1P1Pp2P/1PP4K/4R1r1 w - -',"Not forced and not even the best move - but I think the best ending to this particular 'story'.Black resigned. 
If White recaptures with the rook then after 29...e2 30.Kg2 it is even possible to give up Black's last remaining piece with 30...Bxh3+ 31.Kxh3 Kf3 and after the rook is given up for the pawn Black will win any resulting king and pawn ending."
60,4,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',"I overlooked quickly before this tourney main ideas of this defence. If he captures on e5 getting a stronghold point on d4 with further natural development to keep it on with Nc6 Qd7 0-0-0 and maneuver g8 knight until he reaches g6 square and put double pressure on e5 gambited pawn.

If he would play the safely 3.e3 i would respond ...exd4 with a huge attack on his king as b4 is unprotected e-file with kings exposed and quick development. The d5 square is almost impossible for white to get under control in this line and their remaining d4 will be contested with firepowering pieces as nothing can break knight+ bishop quick development."
61,4,1,dxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The best white move. Release the center pressure is a good + for white.
62,4,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',d4 is a much stronger square than a dxc4 capture and allows queen exchange king uncastled and the unleash of light squared white bishop.

65,4,5,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Here my opponent decided to carry his pawn up as long as he can. 5.g3 and a3 are the most common replies. As white's king is kinda trapped in the center for the moment 5.g3 is a good way to develop bishop because an e3 move would open d-file which white wanna avoid as black's pieces wanna go there. 5.a3 is also good because it prevents a potentially annoying Bb4+.
66,4,6,Be6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',A playable move which puts pressure on the weak c4-pawn and develops a piece on queenside for a further castling. Most played is 5.Nge7 and fight for the e5 pawn immediately by re-routing next on g6.
67,4,7,Nbd2,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A good answer to a potential Bb4. It develops a piece and is probably best move.

Computer recommends 9.h4 instead allowing white some breathing for their bishop and force black to weaken their kingside with an almost absolute h5 needed. It also gives a support to the important g5 square.

75,4,15,Nce7,b'2kr1b1r/pppqnppp/4b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NB1/3NPPPP/2RQKB1R w K -',Computer here recommends 10.h5. The idea is to make white play first to avoid a bishop trap and use the extra tempo to play next move 11.Nce7. I was more focused on the idea of avoiding a potential white Qa4 and should be cautious about this pawn storm.
76,4,16,1h3,b'2kr1b1r/pppqnppp/4b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NBP/3NPPP1/2RQKB1R b K -',give some space for bishop retreat as potential Nf5 is expected. I think white holds on too much for their bishop and that 11.c5 is better as it gains space and force me to play Kb8 because c6 square i can't allow.
77,4,17,1Qc6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1nppp/2q1b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NBP/3NPPP1/2RQKB1R w K -',This move stops any pawn advance as it creates weaknesses black could exploit. c5 creates light squared weaknesses for the e6 black bishop and b5 allows strong c5 outpost. Qc6 also guards from a potentiel Ne4 which would be powerful.
78,4,18,1Nb3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1nppp/2q1b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/PN3NBP/4PPP1/2RQKB1R b K -',I understand the purpose of targeting the d4 pawn but I think this move weakens the support of their queenside pawn storm especially the c4 pawn. It also allows a breach on a-file. Computer recommends instead 12.Nh4 to trade off pieces and eliminate an attacker on the e5 pawn. 
79,4,19,1Nf5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2q1b1n1/4Pn2/1PPp4/PN3NBP/4PPP1/2RQKB1R w K -',I sticked to my plan i thought freeing the dark squared black bishop + getting an outpoust on f5 and protect d4 would be good... but the computer recommends 12.Qa6 12. b5 Qxa3 13. Ra1 Qb4+ 14. Nbd2 Nf5 15. Rxa7 Nxg3 16. fxg3 Bc5 17. Ra8+ Kd7 18. Ra4 Qc3 19. Qb3 Qc1+ 20. Kf2 attacking the a3 and c4-pawn at same time while only one of them would be saved. Although i didnt liked the idea of opening the a-file for a simple regain of the pawn i gambited. Maybe i should be more gutsy and open it as white's kingside is completely out of play for at least 3 moves (Bh2 g4 Bg2). 
80,4,20,1Na5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2q1b1n1/N3Pn2/1PPp4/P4NBP/4PPP1/2RQKB1R b K -',I dont think this move really helps white as i can eventually kick their knight with b6 and c5. That makes pawns closed and lock up completely their attack on my queenside.

82,4,22,1b5,b'2krqb1r/pp3ppp/4b1n1/NPp1Pn2/2Pp4/P4N1P/4PPPB/2RQKB1R b K -',And now i'm stucked with a potentially dangerous knight. There's no way to kick him out by b6 as he'll go on c6 and hurts me bad. I think this mistake is the turning point of the game. My opponent pointed it to me with post-analysis.
83,4,23,1Qd7,b'2kr1b1r/pp1q1ppp/4b1n1/NPp1Pn2/2Pp4/P4N1P/4PPPB/2RQKB1R w K -',Keeps an eye of the weak b7 square while fighting for the d-file.

Although my plan was to free the 8th file for rooks and post one on b8 as i expected g4 and Bb2. The discovered check on b6 isnt dangerous as i have at least a rook or bishop to cover up the queen.

Potential f6 move gains space but allows me to remove my pieces to protect the last entry: the a8-h1 diagonal. Bg5 can have potential threats of his own on e3 so its a more active pieces. Don't forget that e5 pawn must be blockaded at any cost.

I won on time after he made nice sacrifice combination to free up the e6 pawn captured the b7 pawn bring my king into the g7 square made a 2nd queen which was traded off by pieces. I had rook+ knight + pawns vs queen + pawns.

I wanna show this game to maybe increase the popularity of this underground line against queen gambit. It's interesting as a surprise weapon and lot of imbalances in the play makes it real fun to play even several mistakes were done in this game."

It is reputed that Legall accidentally touched his knight on f3 and immediately took his hand away from it. When reminded by Saint Brie that he now had to move the piece Legall analysed the position before playing this move. To those unfamiliar with this game it looks like the best move under the circumstances as White gets a pawn back for the loss of his queen. But that's not the reason at all.

261,13,0,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the Queen's Fianchetto opening. Such an early fianchetto displays that Black is ready to defend against a big pawn structure in the centre trying to flank the pawns with his own pieces. Black must be vigilant so as not to fall victim to any direct attacks on the king as this game very much illustrates.
262,13,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the natural move. White is fine with building up a big pawn structure.

271,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I often use this opening :D
272,14,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Tawba's response is e5 which always make me attack that piece so...
273,14,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',...Nf3. 
274,14,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I think a lot of people would play Nc6 but I didn't meet it now.
275,14,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I brought my bishop to c4 attacking the weak f7 square
276,14,5,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move prevents me from playing Ng5 that would also attack f7.
277,14,6,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Moving my king into safety!
278,14,7,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I met this move and my first thought was that d5 will follow so:
279,14,8,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',in case of d5 I move my bishop to b3 still attacking Black's kingside and also protecting my pawn on e4.
280,14,9,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I didn't expect this. I expected that tawba will develop his minor pieces first.

284,14,13,Ng6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2pp1qnp/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I didn't also expect this. A piece is moved 2 times-and look at my pieces and at Black ones. I have developed my minor pieces but look at the Black bishops and the Black knight on b8 standing on their standard squares and not even Black rooks play...
285,14,14,d4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2pp1qnp/4p3/2BPP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',As I am ready with developing my pieces I can open up some files.

290,14,19,1dxe5,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/2p2q1p/4p3/2B1P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black completes the exchange.

295,14,24,1Bxf7+,b'rn2k2r/pp2bBp1/2p3qp/4P3/4P3/2N1B2b/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',But unfortunately for tawba he may not have noticed this move with which he loses the queen. This was the move when Black resigned. After king moves Black queen is lost and Black's LSB has to retreat. After Qxf7 Rxf7 follows and after Kxf7 gxh3 or I think better is Qf3+ which wins Black's LSB and doesn't make my pawn structure strange and disadvantageous. So the game is over feel free to rate and to comment and also rate and comment please :D
296,15,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I've had a lot of success playing the Evan's Gambit (after 3...Bc5  4. b4!?) so I always aim for that in this position. However my opponent decided not to oblige me. 
297,15,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Breaking open the centre as soon as possible to target the f7 square. 
298,15,2,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I'm in a sacrificial kind of mood:) Anyway this move allows my queen out to b3 to further increase the pressure on f7 if needed and if he takes I can recapture with my knight for a plus in development. 
299,15,3,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Or I could do this. 
300,15,4,Bxb2,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',So I'm down two pawns  but on the other hand my pieces are well developed mostly whereas my opponents pieces are languishing on the back rank. 
301,15,5,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Yup its a mistake. When you're playing black here the thing you have to be conscious of is always the f7 square as its the easiest for white to target. Black should have played Be6. 
302,15,6,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/6N1/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',And now black has no way of guarding the crucial pawn except Be6 which loses a pawn anyway and opens the black king to attack. However my opponent didn't play this he played something much much worse....
303,15,7,f6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np1p2/6N1/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',You can probably see what happens :)
304,15,8,1Ne6,b'r1bq1b1r/pppknBpp/2npNp2/8/4P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',And after some time my opponent resigned having lost his queen in just 10 moves!

It has been a long time since I annotated my last game.   Ever since early June chess has taken a back seat for me as I have had to deal with the loss of a close friend to Secondary Lung Cancer.  My friend Rita received the death sentence in early June and passed away on 27.7.10.  Her funeral was on August 17th.  I still miss her even now and I am at the moment undergoing bereavement counselling.  Amazingly I have still managed to make moves in my games but my rating has taken a bit of a knockback and I will be lucky to be able to hold on to my Class A status.  However it is time to get my chess back on track and my first step is to annotate a game between my buddy Steve which ebbed and flowed all the way through until we reached a fascinating endgame which resulted in a Low Draw for me.  How did this happen?  Well I will continue my commentary on Move 10 because the first 9 moves are the most popular moves in the MT although 7.... Ke8 has been a good choice for black in this MT.  Anyhow before I go any further here is the link to Gameknot Analysis for you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14262186&rnd=0.2819884328735607"

Notice it does not look as though the rook is pinned because it is defended by my g2 pawn BUT that rook is defending my knight on c3 so if that rook is exchanged then I drop the knight next turn.
322,16,17,2d6+,b'5r2/p1k1p3/3P4/2P3pp/2q2Pn1/2N2R2/P1P2BPP/3R2K1 b - -',28. d6+ - my queenside pawns look vulnerable so I decided to exchange one of them.

Gameknot Analysis told me that taking the rook on f4 was a mistake.  Gameknot suggested 31. Rfd3 as an alternative.
325,16,20,fxe3,b'8/3k4/3P4/7p/2q5/2N1p3/P1P3PP/3R2K1 w - -',33. ..... fxe3 - I will soon have to give up my c2 knight for that e3 pawn tears!

328,16,23,4Rxh5,b'8/3k4/3P4/7R/q7/7P/6PK/8 b - -',40. Rxh5 - off comes the black pawn on h5 - at least I have no more black pawns to face just as well because even on her own the Wicked Witch of the West can be positively evil!
329,16,24,Kxd6,b'8/8/3k4/7R/5q2/7P/6P1/7K w - -',41. ....... Kxd6 - after this capture provided I do not lose or move my pawns or lose my rook it is now down to the 50 move rule.  If the pawns stay in the same place and my rook is still on the board and Henry is not about to be murdered by the Witch then on Move 91 I can claim a draw.
330,16,25,Kf6,b'8/8/5k2/7R/8/6qP/6P1/6K1 w - -',44. ....... Kf6 - edging closer to the rook on h5 and forcing him to move.

Even though I would concede a Low Draw on acceptance I was soooo relieved to get away with just a 3 rating point penalty.  Yup I have much work to do to get the focus back into my chess.  Until then bye for now - Joanne

455,22,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',For an attacking player this move is somewhat of a contradiction. 1. e4 is the preferred move .
456,22,1,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',True to his name. Very early White is already revealing his intentions. A very aggressive move.
457,22,2,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1P2/8/PPPNP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move serves two purposes: a.) to support the advance of the e-pawn to e4 and b.) to make possible the move c4 which on 3. Nc3 the knight is blocking the path of the c-pawn.
458,22,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1P2/8/PPPNP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black didn't bother to prevent the eventual advance 4. e4 with 3. ...d5. 
459,22,4,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3PPP2/8/PPPN2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Finally. The position has reached the kind of a King's Indian setup that offers good attacking possibilities for both sides. At this point White has achieved a very menacing position due to his undisputed control of the center.
460,22,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3PPP2/8/PPPN2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',Black quitely continues with his development unmindful of White's dominating center.
461,22,6,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3PPP2/3B4/PPPN2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',A very aggressive move and starting to exert his influence on the king's position.
462,22,7,f5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/5P2/3PP3/3B4/PPPN2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',Whooo. This is a big no no in the opening. Even though 6. f5 looks good White hasn't completed his development yet. 6. Ngf3 followed by 7. O-O is the preferred alternative.
463,22,8,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p2P2/3PP3/3B4/PPPN2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ c6',Black counters by threatening to open up the position thereby leaving the White's king exposed in the center.
464,22,9,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/5P2/3pP3/2PB4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Black stayed on with the plan and begins to trade pawns in order to open the position.
465,22,10,fxg6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1nP1/8/3pP3/2PB4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',Again a very aggressive move aimed at weakening the black king's position.
466,22,11,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',Examining the position at this point it seems White has maintained his hold of the central squares while Black has somewhat realized his plan because the White king now is a little bit exposed.
467,22,12,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2np1np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Continuing with his own development and exerting pressure on the central squares especially the pawn at d4.
468,22,13,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2np1np1/3P4/4P3/3B4/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',This is the start of his downful. By neglecting his development White allowed the Black's forces to build up and exert pressure on his position.
469,22,14,1Be2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/3Pn3/4P3/8/PP1NB1PP/R1BQK1NR b KQ -',White has lost two moves with 10. d5 and 11. Be2. 
470,22,15,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/3Pn3/4P1b1/8/PP1NB1PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Black made this move in the hope that if White exchanged Bishops with 12. Bxg4 he would weakened the white squares on White's position.
471,22,16,1Ngf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1np1/3Pn3/4P1b1/5N2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Preparing to castle kingside with 13. O-O thereby bringing the King to safety.
472,22,17,1Nfd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppb1/3p2p1/3Pn3/4P1b1/5N2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black is slowly gaining control of the dark squares. Notice the position of the bishop on c1 that made the whole thing possible.
473,22,18,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppb1/3p2p1/3Pn3/4P1b1/5N2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',It seems White has already solved his main problem which is to bring his King to safety.
474,22,19,1Qb6+,b'r4rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P1b1/5N2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And now it is Black who suddenly becomes aggressive due to the fact that his pieces are better placed than the White's counterparts. Notice his total control of the dark squares at the moment.
475,22,20,Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5b2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',If White replies with 15. Nxf3 Black would intend to play 15 ...Nxf3 16. Bxf3 and the bishop would be bad because it is of the same white square as the central pawns.
476,22,21,1Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',This must be a bad move since it allows Black to proceed with his development uncontested.
477,22,22,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Taking control of the open file and bringing the rook to life. Black must be winning at this point.
478,22,23,1Qe2,b'2r2rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PP1NQ1PP/R1B2R1K b - -',I don't understand why White insists of putting his knight on d2 which is obstructing the other bishop.
479,22,24,1Rc2,b'5rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PPrNQ1PP/R1B2R1K w - -',Black has complete control of the position and it will be only a matter of time before White makes a decisive mistake.
480,22,25,1Rb1,b'5rk1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PPrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K b - -',White's choices is very limited. 
481,22,26,1Rfc8,b'2r3k1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/5B2/PPrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K w - -',Putting another dagger into White's position.
482,22,27,1a3,b'2r3k1/pp1nppb1/1q1p2p1/3Pn3/4P3/P4B2/1PrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K b - -',White's last two moves were very passive indicating that he's waiting for Black to execute a decisive plan.
483,22,28,1Nc5,b'2r3k1/pp2ppb1/1q1p2p1/2nPn3/4P3/P4B2/1PrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K w - -',Now Black owns the d3 square.
484,22,29,1Bg4,b'2r3k1/pp2ppb1/1q1p2p1/2nPn3/4P1B1/P7/1PrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K b - -',Threatening to capture the rook on c8.
485,22,30,1Rc7,b'6k1/ppr1ppb1/1q1p2p1/2nPn3/4P1B1/P7/1PrNQ1PP/1RB2R1K w - -',Black could have won the bishop on c1 with 19. ...Nxg4 20. Qxg4 Nd3! followed by 21. ...Nxc1. But on the other hand White has a very good move with 21. Qf3. And if Black takes the bishop with 21. ...Nxc1 White would reply with 22. Qxf7+ attacking the Black King.
486,22,31,2Nc4,b'6k1/ppr1ppb1/1q1p2p1/2nPn3/2N1P1B1/P7/1Pr1Q1PP/1RB2R1K b - -',He should have done this a long time ago. It's too late now and White would lose the knight for nothing.
487,22,32,2Be3,b'6k1/ppr1ppb1/1q1p2p1/2nPn3/2r1P1B1/P3B3/1P2Q1PP/1R3R1K b - -',Finally the Bishop breaks free for the cost of a whole piece. The remaining moves would need no more comments since Black is clearly winning.
488,22,33,Qh2#,b'3Q4/pp2pp1k/3p2p1/3P4/4PbP1/P7/7q/7K w - -',
489,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my 3rd game as White in Freddy's (easy19) third edition of the Annotation Project.  I thought this game might be a bit interesting particularly for those in the tourney.  The first six moves are all predetermined.
490,23,1,Bxf7+,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Although not required this move is a must.
491,23,2,Bf7+,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',I really wanted Black's K to move to c7 and then b6.  
492,23,3,Ke8,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',With this move it became apparent that Black was either going to keep his K at e8 or we were going to draw through perpetual.  No fun in that.
493,23,4,1Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p5/4p1N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White has to mobilize his pieces and create an attack as quickly as possible while constraining Black or White gives away the advantage.
494,23,5,1Ne6,b'rn1qk2r/pp2b1pp/2p1N3/8/4NpB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This is where the N is happiest.
495,23,6,1Qb6,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',In my calculations this is where I expected the Q to go.  It prevents White from O-O and attacks b2 perhaps containing the DSB.
496,23,7,1d3,b'rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpB1/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I was prepared to give up b2 to the Queen to launch an attack.  As White in this tourney I think it's a mistake to play passively.  Perhaps 16. Bxf4 Qxb2 17. O-O  I'm not sure if this would be correct but this was my idea.
497,23,8,1Bh4+,b'rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpBb/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This move surprised me.  I was expecting the N to come out (perhaps 15...Nd7 16...Nf6) to disrupt White's attack and get another piece into the action.  I wasn't sure of the purpose of Bh4+ except perhaps to disrupt White's K-side pawn structure and make O-O less desirable.
498,23,9,1hxg3,b'rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qp1N3/8/4N1Bb/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Forced or the Rook goes bye-bye.
499,23,10,1Bf6,b'rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qp1Nb2/8/4N1B1/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R w KQ -',17...Bf6 is an error in my view.  I believe that Be7 was needed to prevent Nd6+ followed by Nc4 attacking the Q while at the same time guarding b2 and allowing O-O-O
500,23,11,1Nc4,b'rn5r/pp1k2pp/1qp1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Black's Q has very few safe squares particularly given the discovered check by White's LSB.
501,23,12,1Qb4+,b'rn5r/pp1k2pp/2p1Nb2/8/1qN3B1/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black's plan is to withdraw the Q safely (obviously).  However this allows the DSB to develop with tempo.
502,23,13,Qe7,b'rn5r/pp1kq1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/R3K2R w KQ -',White's N is pinned but protected from any attack.  Black's N has not move nor has either of his Rooks.
503,23,14,2O-O-O,b'rn5r/pp1kq1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KR3R b - -',Breaking the pin connecting the rooks and the preparing for a full assault on the King.
504,23,15,2Ke8,b'rn2k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KR3R w - -',21...Ke8 loses the Q with 22 Rhe1.  dmaestro told me after the game that he considered 21...Qxe6  22. Bxe6  Kxe6 with even material.  I think that would have been interesting but White would still have held the advantage given that his other pieces were developed and his King was safely tucked away.
505,23,16,2Rhe1,b'rn2k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KRR3 b - -',And Black resigns.  My thanks to dmaestro for the game.  This is a really interesting tourney.  I wonder if freddy will be able to come up with The Annotation Project IV?
506,24,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I chose e4 to kick off with.
507,24,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A common response e5 was played.
508,24,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I developed my knight to f3 and was looking forward to Black's next move which was...
509,24,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',...Nc6 that protects his e5 pawn and attacks the d4 square.
510,24,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And now I didn't choose Ruy Lopez but King's pawn game (C50)
511,24,5,h6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black prevented my 4th Ng5 move but Be7 would do the same but also develop his DSB.
512,24,6,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And now d3 follows intending to attack Black's kingside.
513,24,7,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4... a6 doesn't do too much... If I moved my LSB to c4 why would I move it to b5? If I had wanted to move my LSB there I would have waited with developing my LSB and instead I would make some other developing moves.
514,24,8,Be3,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Be3 was a developing move I could also have castled kingside or move my other knight on c3.
515,24,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1pp1/p1n2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This was also a developing move but I started thinking. First I thought about that he would castle kingside and I would have an easy game because of my 2 bishops aiming at Black's kingside and I could play other moves or rather a move combination attacking Black's kingside for example Nh4 O-O f4 Qf3 or sometime Nc3 and after Nd5 to make Black's knight on f6 deal with my knight on d5. Or the other option would be that he wanted to castle queenside in more moves and this game would be quite dynamic.
516,24,10,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1pp1/p1n2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',OK first I wanted to be one move to Nd5 so I developed my other knight.
517,24,11,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbpp1/p1n2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',As I thougth. It seems Black wants to castle kingside. Then I can continue my plan...

I believe White has an excellent move here in the unlikely-looking 16.c4! But why on earth this move - which only seems to open up White's own king position and attract ideas of ...Rac8 for Black? The answer is partly based upon the observation that if Black captures the pawn on c4 then his queen will be cut off from the fourth rank and king-side. The other part of the answer is the tactical proof: Thus for example after 16.c4 dxc4? 17.Bxf6 Rxf6 18.Bc2 and Black is suddenly lost. 
Similarly 16.c4 rules out 16...Ne4? which now fails for tactical reasons because the bishop on d7 is unprotected after 17.Bxe4 dxe4 18.Rxd7 and there is no time for to take the f3 knight because of mating threats against g7. Meanwhile 18...Qxc4 is no more than a spite check in a lost position.
Finally 16...Rac8 Ng5 leads to some very interesting possibilities. Preliminary analysis suggests that after 16.c4!? Rf7 may in fact be the best answer - but still leads to a sustained attack by White."

We can see the logical flow in this game. In the opening aim is to control the center. In the middle game aim is to dominate the center and open lines to attack the opponent's King. In the end dominate the 7th rank. Looks like a text book game. My guess is many Chess principles of today were authored after studying Steinitz Lasker and Capablanca's games."

The problem for Black is that if White plays for a win the Black king ends up as the target in a shooting gallery where choosing the best move for Black is difficult even counter-intuitive while White's attack almost plays itself.  The key positional features are intense pressure down the c and e files and the weakness of the h1-a8 and h3-c8 diagonals.

Black's a pawn down with a busted pawn structure.

Even worse is 7 . . . Kf6 8 Qxd5 e6 9 Qg5+ Kf7 10 Qxd8 Bb4+ 11 c3 Rxd8 12 cxb4.  And worst of all is 7 . . . Kg8 8 Qxd5+ e6 9 Qxe6#."

Larsen could have taken a draw by repetition and that's one of the main options here.  The Black king simply wobbles back and forth between e6 and f7.  It doesn't matter whether White's queen checks from e2 g4 or h3.  In all the games I could find with those three moves after Fischer-Larsen this wobble between e6 and f7 produced a draw."

In addition to 8 g3 White has tried 8 c4 N5f6 9 d5+ Kd6 10 Qf7 Ne5 11 Bf4 c5 12 Nc3 a6 which brings us to a parting of the ways:  13 0-0-0? or 13 b4!?.

De Firmian tried 13 0-0-0? against Rhode in the 1989 U. S. Championship but got blown up by 13 . . . g6 14 Bxe5+ Kxe5 15 d6 Bh6+ 16 Kc2 Qe8.  This disaster was repeated in Rozentalis-Sokolov (Bern 1992) and Rublevsky-Hauchard (Akham 1992).  Enders-Teschke (Neubrandenburg 1998) tried to improve the line with 16 f4+ Bxf4+ 17 Kb1 and survived the opening losing in 54 moves.  And finally there was Ivanukh-Shpagin (Kharkov Matskevich Memorial 2009) where we have 16 Kb1 Rf8 17 Re1+ (17 . . . Qxe7!?) Kxd6 18 Rd1+ Kc7 19 Rxd8 Rxf7 0-1.  True Smistik-Vyskocil (Brno Trade 2004) produced a draw but only because Vyskocil failed to find the best answer to 16 Kc2 playing 16 . . . Qf8?! instead of the stronger 16 . . . Qe8.  Finally de Firmian gives 13 0-0-0 g6 14 Re1 Bh6 ""winning"" so apparently 14 Re1 isn't the answer either.

13 b4! presents Black with the problem of how to keep White from peeling the cover off his king.  According to de Firmian (citing Keres) 13 . . . cxb4 14 c5+ Kxc5 14 Na4+ Kd6 16 Nb2 gives White an advantage.  And he finds fault with 13 . . . b6 14 Rb1 g6 15 bxc5+ bxc5 16 Rb7!.  Defending the c pawn with the queen doesn't appear optimal either:  13 . . . Qc7 14 Na4!? cxb4 15 c5+ Kd7 16 Qe6+ with an edge for White.  Instead de Firmian recommends 13  . . . Qb6! 14 Rc1 Qxb4 15 Bd3 (unclear).

My problem with the 8 c4 line was exactly this lack of clarity.  The position after 13 0-0-0 obviously favors Black unless and until a major improvement is found for White.  So the best White seemed able to hope for is a precarious balance between his initiative and Black's extra piece in the 13 b4 line.  But is it?

After 13 b4! Qb6 14 Rc1 Qxb4 15 Bd3 White is one move away from bringing his last heavy piece to bear.  Black on the other hand has a knight pinned on e5 and defended only by his king.  His queen has been diverted to b4 and his rooks and dark-square bishop are out of play.  And it turns out he has no adequate move because the White bishop on f4 can't be deflected breaking the absolute pin on the Black knight:  15 . . . g5 16 Bg3 h5 17 0-0 h4 18 Bxe5+ Kxe5 19 f4+ and we've reached the stage where Black has only three possible moves one (19 . . . Kd4) leading to a forced mate.

The verdict:  8 c4 is not only playable but it's Black who needs to find an improvement as long as White sticks to the 13 b4! line."

Fluvia Poyatos-Aloma Vidal (Andorra 2008) was a win for Black after 8 . . . N7f6 9 Bh3+ Kd6 10 Qe5+ Kc6 11 Bg2!? b5 12 a4 b4 but a closer look suggests White has at least compensation for the knight.  The key is the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal so White rejected the exchange of bishops on c8 in favor of pressure against the knight on d4 (11 Bg2!?).  Black can temporarily prevent c4 with 11 . . . b5 but that exposes the undefended rook on a8.  The game continued 13 c4 bxc3 14 bxc3 Ba6 and it's clear Black's in trouble; but White slipped with 15 Nd2? (15 c4! Bxc4 16 Nd2 Ba6 17 Ba3 with an advantage) e6  16 c4 Bb4? (It's essential to defend the pawn on e6 so 16 . . . Qe8 = or even 16 . . . Qd6).  White now missed a win with 17 Qxe6+ and lost after 17 Ba3 Bxa3 18 Qxe6+ Qd6 19 cxd5+ Kb6 20 Rxa3?? Rae8 21 a5+ Kb7 0-1.

The most popular continuation appears to be 8 . . . b5 9 a4 c6 (9 . . . b4!?).  Yemelin-Popov (St. Petersburg 2005) continued 10 Bh3+ Kd6 11 Nc3 b4 12 Nxd5?! (12 Bf4+!) cxd5 13 c4? when White had frittered away his advantage and Black went on to win.

Bd6 15 Bxh8?!  Here winning the exchange is not best; the thematic 15 a5 is the killer threatening to undermine the knight on d5 by winning the knight on b6.  If the b6 knight retreats it blocks d7 leaving the Black king without a move and 15 . . . Rf8 16 0-0 Kd7 17 axb6 should also be fatal.  But after 15 Bxh8 Black instead of being crushed held on and escaped with a draw.  10 . . . c6 11 c4 Qa5+ 12 Bd2 Qa6 13 cxd5 is only slightly better than 10 . . . N7b6 and 10 . . .

Black has several problems:  his exposed king the pressure on e5 the weakness of the h1-a8 and h3-c8 diagonals and his entangled minor pieces on d5 d7 and c8.  That effectively rules out undermining e5 with 11 Bxd7 since if the focus shifts to the long white diagonal the Bishop will be priceless and Black's congestion won't be easily relieved.  The same goes for 11 Nc3 Nxc3 since Black gets to exchange off a potential target for a potent attacker perhaps leaving him with a very slight edge after 12 gxc3 Qf6.  11 Na3 avoids the exchange but leads to very little after say 11 . . . c6 12 c4 12 Nb4 13 dxe5+ Kc7.   Finally passive moves such as 11 Bg2 exd4 12 0-0 and 11 0-0 exd4 12 c4 appear to lead to equality after Black returns the piece.
626,29,12,1Bg7,b'r1bq3r/pppn2bp/3k2p1/3np3/2PP4/6PB/PP2QP1P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The knight should be returned but 11 . . . c5 12 cxd5 cxd4 13 Nd2 Nc5 14 Bg2 Kc7 is probably the best way to do it because it allows Black to exchange the c pawn on d4 instead of the e pawn which continues to prevent Bf4+.  It's hard for Black to find the right path because untangling his pieces and defending e5 are such high priorities.  For instance 11 . . . Bg7 defends e5 and even threatens counter play down the e file with 12 . . .Re8 and 13 . . . cxd4; but it also allows the bishop check on f4.

I went with 12 cxd5 because the counter play based on 12 . . . Re8 is an illusion thwarted by the weakness of e5 and the check with Bf4 the moment Black plays exd4.  The White knight will follow the bishop coming from b1-c3-e4 with check blocking the e file.

Unfortunately for the rook this is easily the best move Black has:  14 . . . Kc5 leads to a forced mate after 15 b4+ Kxb4 16 Be6 Rxe6 17 dxe6 d3 18 Qb2+; 14 . . . Ne5 fails against 15 Ne4+ Ke7 16 Bg5+; and 14 . . . Be5 is undone by 15 Nb5+ Ke7 16 Bxd7 Bxd7 17 Bxe5 Kf8 18 Nxc7.

This opening is actually called the Costage Trap. Playing 4. Nxe5 White allowed this move. Black is threatening both White's knight and pawn. The problem is that if White just moves his knight to f3 after Black takes the pawn he is threatening the rook on h1 which would come with check and now in this position the knight is open to attack. If White moves his rook Black takes on f3 with his knight with check and this is terrible for White. And if White takes the knight on d4 then after 6. ... Qxh1 he's lost a rook the king moves to e2 or blocks with the bishop and then Black can take on e4 with check. Castling is actually a good move here but Waitzkin believes 5. Bxf7+ would've been the best move. Black has to move his king. Now though if White moves the knight to d3 to save it from the Black queen his pawn on g2 is open to capture. White then has to defend the rook playing 7. Rf1. But Black then plays 7. ... Qxe4+ and it is all over. White's king is trapped and can't move to f1 because the rook is there. The only move he can play is 8. Qe2 to block the check. Black then plays 8. Qxe2#. So White can't do that. If he plays a move like 5. Nxf7 Black plays 5. ... Qxg2. White will have no time to take Black's rook on h8 because his rook on h1 is under fire and if he moves it to f1 then after 6. ... Qxe4+ he loses his queen. After 7. Qe2 Nxe2 8.

Black's bishop would have to move back and then White could start to defend. Notice that White can't play 8. g3 here blocking the check and attacking the queen. This might initially seem good because if Black's queen moves White can take on g4 and he's won a piece back. But here Black has the very strong 8. Nxf3+. Now White's king has to move. Black can then moves his queen away and White is in huge trouble. Black can also play 7. ... Bxf3. After 8. gxf3 Black plays 8. ... Qg2 attacking the rook on h1 and the pawn on f3. But after 9.

819,36,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',My opponent continues with development my immediate guess is that his intention is Bg3 thus pinning my knight to my queen. 
820,36,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I respond with d4 a nice move that I tend to favor given the opportunity. It takes a fairly dominating control of the center while forcing the opponent to attend to his erstwhile soldier being threatened by the now discovered dark squared bishop.
821,36,5,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6p1/3PPp1P/5N2/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',My opponent responds with the common and quite effective g5. Here I make an interesting attempt to peal off that defense. Admittedly I do not know the theory behind this move at all it was simply a move I thought of and utilized. At this point I am rather intent on securing my the pawn on f4 I have a significant advantage in development and control of the center if I could equalize the material I should have the game fairly securely in my favor. My only concern is g4 in which case I would have sacrificed my knight as opposed to moving it to either h2 or d2. I would have attempted to take advantage of the additional tempi and launch a whirlwind tactical assault upon the opponents center. For example Zimmer vs. Hans Mueller in 1918. In that particular case white sacrifices two pawns and a knight similar to this game in order to gain the initiative to win the game.
822,36,6,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb3p/3p1p2/6p1/2BPPp1P/5N2/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',My opponent chooses to defend his defense but in doing so exposes a fairly huge weakness on his kingside. He follows up with a weak Bd7 a move I cannot even hope to explain. The only other square he could have moved his light squared bishop to was g4 pinning my knight to my queen (finally). Retrospectively the better of the two moves for the bishop.
823,36,7,Nxg5,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb3p/3p1p2/6N1/2BPPp1P/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',That move proves to be my opponents undoing because the only two moves prevent checkmate Qe7 and Nh6; Qe7 losing the rook after 8. Nf7. Even with the best move the material has been evened and the position is strongly in my favor.
824,36,8,Qh5+,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb3p/3p4/6pQ/2BPPp1P/8/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',"Unfortunately for black he does not see the looming checkmate. He accepts the ""poison knight"" and allows for Qh5+. My opponent then resigns seeing 8... Ke7 9.Qf7#. This is my first annotation I chose (obviously) a short and tactical game for simplicities sake. This game is an excellent example of the strength in the King's Gambit especially against opponents not entirely familiar with the lines. Forcing your opponent into a sharp tactical game creates a very small margin for error and that can be capitalized on by a clever tactician particularly in Blitz games. Please comment and let me know what you think."

Ananya here is a quote from our previous game: ""According to MCO the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. ..."" So since I won with the White side I intentionally played the Grunfeld as Black to see how I can handle the other side. This is the first time playing the Black side of this defense."

14. Rd1 removing the rook from the deadly a1-h8 diagonal. If you choose later to play d5 it would be safer because the rook is not on that line of fire. The move you chose here enabled my strong knight move (14. ... Nb4!)."
884,38,26,1Nb4,b'r1br2k1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3P4/1n2P3/2B4P/P3NPP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',The knight cannot safely be taken on b4 as 15. BxR looses the exchange (as we played in the actual game). I think the best move is 15. BxB. I would not fork your king and rook because after NxR you play BxN. You would have gotten a bishop and knight for a rook a better deal for you. Instead I would play KxB then I still have the Knight threat.

When I looked at this line I eagerly played it because it gave me a material advantage and I could not see a way for you to force the pawn any further after I put my bishop on d7 and rook on e8. Since you were way behind in development you bishop and rook would take a long time to back the pawn up. I was sure I'd come out on top and in a worst case scenario I'd always be able to give up the exchange via RxB then win the pawn back on e7. This would make us even steven again. As it turned out I was able to win the bishop knight and d-pawn in exchange for the rook! Pretty nice exchange rate! Better than the U.S. dollar!

As it turned out (though not in my plan at this point) the king on g7 was also needed to get your knight. See move 22.

I felt the bishop was more needed on the a5-d8 diagonal to threaten the bishop trade via Bd8 and to prevent Nd5 then Nc7. If you got your knight to c7 RxB does not work as well as it did in the game because I can't get the knight. At this point after the night move I saw your threat of Nd5 then Nf6. So I planned on how to deal with that as you saw in the game.

897,38,39,Ba5,b'r3r3/pp2Bpkp/3P2p1/b2N4/b3P3/7P/P3KPP1/5B1R w - -',So this is to prevent Nc7 to see if you'd play Nf6(???).

I gain a bishop a knight and a pawn (a value of 7 points). You gain a rook (5 points). All I needed to do is 22. ... RxB removing the knight's defense 23. PxR KxN. Then you can't defend the pawn and if you push the pawn to promote I play RxQ bringing all of my pieces into play. You were already down the exchange and could not afford to lose any more material. You were also behind in development and could not afford to help mine.

I've never had anyone trade on f5 before. I wonder if he's planning to follow up with Bd3 and threaten Bxh7. But after Bd3 I'm going to move Qd5 with my attack on g2."

And I don't want to go to d7 and block my knight. But maybe that would work better and plan to go to c7 (if he doesn't develop the bishop to f4).

Is he going to castle queenside? That's so unusual against this opening."

There's the blunt threat of Bd3 that attacks the queen and the pawn on h7. But worse is Bg2. I''m not going to be able to stop d5 and that's when the game falls apart for me."

I've gotten my rating high not so much by playing so wonderfully as much as I haven't made many blunders like this on GameKnot. It seems to me if you avoid bad blunders and timing out you can get at least a 1400 or 1500 rating on GameKnot.
