0,0,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Less often played than exd leads to a well-known game in which one of main black concerns is how to develop the dsb. 
1,0,1,c3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I would try c4 instead but this move makes black play following a known scheme.

27,1,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This being a blitz game of course there's going to be errors.   If they're half as wild as what happened in the game I'd love to see what we missed!
28,1,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I play the French as black so this suited me.
29,1,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',A bit earlier than usual?   I play Nf6 here in this line.   I think it all transposes anyway.
30,1,3,Ngf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3PP3/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"This isn't absolutely mainline; the knight usually goes to e2 allowing the other knight to go to f3 and prepare for a strong defence of the d4 pawn.   This is part of a gambit line I picked up off an openings DVD.   Unfortunately I later overheard the presenter of the DVD discussing the line as (and I paraphrase) ""good for white if it's accepted which is why it's never accepted"".   Still for the one time that it is accepted I'm ready!"
31,1,4,Nd7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',With Qb6 in instead of Be7 this is the gambit line.   The d-pawn is doomed but white ignores that and continues 8. O-O cxd   9. cxd NxP   10. NxP QxP   11. Nf3! Qb6   12. Qa4 (pinning the knight with the intention of making things quite awkward for an undeveloped black) Qb4 (looking to swap off)   13. Qc2 Qc5   14. Qe2.   Now the black bishop and rook are prepared to come into the game with tempo on the queen and black is still struggling to get his pieces out.   Two players have played this line against me on gameknot and I won in 27 and 23 moves despite being 70 and 150 points out-rated.
32,1,5,b6,b'r1bqk2r/p2nbppp/1pn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Presuambly a bit worried about castling kingside with the f6 knight kicked and pieces pointing that way.   It's still ok to castle (8...O-O 9. Bxh7+? KxB 10. NxB+ BxN 11. Qh5+ Bh6 - the Greek gift doesn't work) provided care is taken.   Black can go for an f6 break straight after.   The text is a bit slow.

I find that in the French in particular it can be hard to get a plan going until Black has committed his king to one side or the other (a centre-break isn't really on).   Had I a better plan here?
34,1,7,1b3,b'r3k2r/pbqnbppp/1pn1p3/2ppP3/P2P4/1PPB1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',b4 is too well defended of course so I need to get more suppose for my pawns starting with a Ba3.
35,1,8,h5,b'2kr3r/pbqnbpp1/1pn1p3/2ppP2p/P2P4/BPPB1N2/3N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - h6',So far the game's been going all my way.   Now black indicates he wants to play a bit too.

I played it more on instinct - being a short time-control game - than analysis.   There are tricks though - after 13...cxb 14. cxb NxB 15. Rc1 Nc6?? the e7 bishop hangs.   If instead 15...Bc6 16. Ba6+ Kb8 17. Nb1 covers the rook fork (...Nd3) and prepares Nb1-c3-b5.

Anyways black turned down the pawn offer so all the above was redundant."

38,1,11,1Nb3,b'2k3rr/pbqnbp2/2n1p3/1BppP1pp/P2P4/BNP2N2/5PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',The f-knight needs a square.   The text also builds up a bit of pressure on c5.   After stuff like 16...c4 I think I have 17. BxN BexB (not often that differentiation is needed!   If the other bishop is taken I have BaxB) 18. BxB+ QxB 19. RxB PxN  20. RxP and I'm a pawn up with the initiative (black's queen is hit) and the better king safety.
39,1,12,h4,b'2k3rr/pbqnbp2/2n1p3/1BppP3/P2P2pp/BNP5/3N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Earlier I had thought my attack would break through first but now I wasn't at all sure!   Still nothing I can do about it yet.   Hack on with my attack is best.   I didn't like 18. NxP though - 18...NxP 19. BxN BxB 20. PxB and the c-file that I'm trying to open now has my own doubled pawns on it.   I'm not sure how else I can continue my attack though and amn't that happy with my next move.
40,1,13,2a6,b'2k4r/pbqnbp2/P1n1p3/1BppP3/3P4/BNP3r1/3N2P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',And this seems to actually help black; I'm closing things up and the bishop at a8 will defend happily and maybe hope to get a look along the long diagonal at some later stage.   Meanwhile my king is getting quite open.
41,1,14,2Nxc5,b'b1k4r/p1qnbp2/P1n1p3/1BNpP3/3P4/B1P3r1/3N2P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',I think this sums up where I am at the moment - playing moves I turned down previously.   If let I'm eyeing b7.

However maybe black can give up his c6 knight.   After 23. Nb7 Qg8!?   24. Re2 Qh7   25. Kf2 Qh2   26. Qg1 the c6 square feels miles away.   I don't think the knight is worth the g2 pawn."

45,1,18,Kb7,b'3q3r/pk1nbp2/4p3/3pP3/Q2P4/B1P3r1/3N2P1/R3R1K1 w - -',Black had a bit of an aul think here; I didn't see his next move though (partly because of the time control obviously; I just played the obvious because it looked right)
46,1,19,2Rab1+,b'3q3r/pk1nbp2/4p3/3pP3/Q2P4/B1P3r1/3N2P1/1R2R1K1 b - -',The other rook may have been better - leaving the a-rook and the queen to gang up on the a7 pawn - but I had it in my mind that the e-rook was soon to be needed at e2 in a defensive capacity.   But after 27. Reb1+ Nb6 28. BxB QxB 29. QxP+ I pick up black's queen.   Maybe a similar sac as in the game would have been on for black.

Re2 Qg5 31. Qd7+ Ka8 32. Qc6+ Kb8 33. RxN+! PxR 34. QxP+ and I've a draw anyway and a win given any tempo to get in c6.
50,1,23,Qg5+,b'7r/pk3p2/1n2p3/2PpP1q1/Q7/2P5/3N2K1/1R2R3 w - -',I'm rook for pawn up both knights are hanging and black is on a king-hunt.
51,1,24,3Kf1,b'7r/pk3p2/1n2p3/2PpP1q1/Q7/2P5/3N4/1R2RK2 b - -',31. Kf2 allows QxN with check.   Kf3 seems to be asking too much after 31...Rh3+
52,1,25,3Ke2,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p3/2PpP1q1/Q7/2P5/3NK3/1R2R2r b - -',It's possible black felt he didn't have time to take my knight because of his own weak knight - I'm threatening the curious Qd7+ with the queen immune from capture as the knight is pinned.   Black may need to keep up the checks and material be damned.
53,1,26,Rh2+,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p3/2PpP2q/Q7/2P2N2/4K2r/1R2R3 w - -',And similarly a pinned knight allows black a move I hadn't considered.   I'm fairly sure Nf3 was still correct though.   But I thought I had everything covered until black played this.
54,1,27,3Ke3,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p3/2PpP2q/Q7/2P1KN2/7r/1R2R3 b - -',Anything else hangs the knight with check.
55,1,28,3Kd3,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p2q/2PpP3/Q7/2PK1N2/7r/1R2R3 b - -',The knight is doing sterling work now preventing Q (or R)d2#.   With black a rook down his knight unable to join the action and his two major pieces struggling to get in at my king black may have to settle for perpetual here.   If he can find it.   Meanwhile with the knight hanging I can sac a fair bit of material to end the checks.
56,1,29,3Qg6+,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p1q1/2PpP3/Q7/2PK1N2/7r/1R2R3 w - -',Here Kd4 loses the queen though black's rook and knight are both hanging!   (A sample line may be 36. Kd4 Qg4+ 37. Ke3 QxQ 38. NxR Qe4+ and there's chances of picking up the knight or the important c5-pawn - saving black's knight - with checking forks).   After Ke3 we seem to have perpetual.   I don't think black was expecting my next move though.
57,1,30,3Re4,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p1q1/2PpP3/Q3R3/2PK1N2/7r/1R6 b - -',!!   The checks are over and with black's knight hanging I'll come out of the exchanges material up.   A swap off will remove black's queen as well and if black doesn't want to swap he can't stop Qd7+ (or Qe8+ if the king moves back).   After 36...Qg2 37. PxN I have all the checking squares on the second rank covered.   And again stuff like 36...Qg2 37. PxN PxR+ 38. QxP+ and I think black is getting mated.   Don't anyone dare refute this move! :)
58,1,31,Rc2,b'8/pk3p2/1n2p3/2P1P3/4K3/2P2N2/2r5/1R6 w - -',I've always enjoyed how in Tal v Hecht from the Varna Olympiad (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1139582) all Tal's wild sacs are ultimately just to reach a technically won - but not straightforward - endgame.   I don't for an instant pretend to be a Tal but I do like how I've emulated him ever so slightly here!   There's still a long way to go to bring home the point though; black has decent drawing chances.   Tal's achieved endgame was easier to win!

Though 46...f5 is probably still good for black here - I think I need at least one pawn to win and PxPep leaves me with just the one.   Possibly I could try centralising with 47. Rd4; if black takes my pawns are re-connected and my knight is much stronger.   Any other move may let me gain space with Rc4+ forcing the king back.   Or perhaps better was just Nc4

166,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Me and my opponent Mattcarr play each other regularly both on Gameknot and with a proper board and pieces. Due to Mattcarr's greater experience playing the games usually go his way (such as out of the 10 games we have played on Gameknot he was won 8 of those) but recently due to my own abilities improving and some teaching/training that he gave me some of those games have become harder for him to win and 2 have gone my way. On the morning of December 25th we decided upon a Christmas Game. This is the result of that game and how I approached the game which includes many swap offs and a little fierce battle for center control near the end.
167,5,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I saw this layout and believed myself to be heading towards a Scotch opening. Though I like the Scotch personally when I'm playing as White as Black I do not as I believe it can give White an advantage having their Queen on D5. So I chose to counter and take my Queen onto D5 instead by offering White the D file pawn.
168,5,2,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The use of the knight of course forces my Queen to retreat or be lost. At this stage of the game I was not willing to lose my Queen for a Knight so I of course chose to retreat allowing White to control the center squares from afar.
169,5,3,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3q4/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',Here I believe White to be offering his pawn for a later Queen exchange (exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4) but something I've learnt from my regular games with Mattcarr is that he won't offer a pawn without expecting to gain a greater reward a few moves in. So I chose not to take the bait playing Nc6 instead to defend the e5 pawn and pose a faint attack on the d4 pawn.
170,5,4,Bxc6+,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1Bq4/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Here the first of only four checks in the game (including mate) a point piece swap off. My normal retaliation to this attack by Mattcarr is to take back with a pawn which results in me having doubled up pawns. Today I had the Queen available to ensure the pawns didn't become doubled up unless absolutely necessary which I did.
171,5,5,Qxc6,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1q5/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This also allows for an attack on both Knights if I want to get reckless.
172,5,6,Nxe5,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1q5/4N3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I don't understand this move. The Knight now poses a threat to the Black Queen but the Queen has an obvious escape route to take the pawn back on G2 as well as further attacking Whites back ranks.
173,5,7,Qf3,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/4N3/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PqP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Black's attack of White's back ranks is stopped with offering Queen Ultimatum. Again a common theme in the games between myself and Mattcarr is the offering of Queens early in the game. Here I would rather like to keep my Queen in an attacking mode however any square my Queen goes on will result in its loss. G file is covered by White's Queen black squared bishop and the Knight on e5. Taking the Rook results in a Queen loss for Black as does taking either of the two pawns. Moving to h3 would only prolong the maneuver as White is clearly happy to do a Queen exchange. So with retreat out of the option I chose to take White's offer of Queen swap.
174,5,8,Qxf3,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/4N3/3P4/2N2q2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',White loses his Queen Black goes 9 points up...

176,5,10,1Nf6,b'r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I chose this move as I wished to begin developing my pieces having lost the only two pieces I had developed. I chose the Knight above the Bishops because the Knight could be kept safer on the 6th rank. It gave me a chance to see Whites next move and allow me to plan from there.
177,5,11,1Bf4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/8/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQkq -',The bringing out of this Bishop made me consider a Bishop swap off with (Bd6 12. Bxd6 cxd6) but I decided against it as the endgame may require more piece than just pawns so I opted for attacking Whites Knight instead with Bg4.
178,5,12,1Ne5,b'r3kb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N3/3P1Bb1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQkq -',The Knight moves from danger and immediately threatens the Bishop in return. A strong move forcing me to either retreat the Bishop or do the swap off for a Knight that I hadn't wished to do.
179,5,13,1Bh5,b'r3kb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/3P1B2/2N5/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQkq -',I wanted to keep coverage of that diagonal so chose to retreat the Bishop to safety on h5. This also stops Whites King from moving onto the d1 or e2 squares.
180,5,14,1O-O,b'r3kb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/3P1B2/2N5/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b kq -',This castle would prove to be fatal to White due to the lack of a King pawn defence due to my Queens earlier attack. However White is now in the strong position of having connected Rooks ready to launch an attack if he so wished.
181,5,15,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/3P1B2/2N5/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',In retaliation I chose to castle Queen side which put me one move away from connecting my own Rooks in direct retaliation to White's castling.
182,5,16,Bd6,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2b1n2/4N2b/3P4/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',To finalise my moves of connecting my Rooks I moved my Bishop into an area attack Whites Knight. Luckily my earlier choice of retreating the white squared Bishop to the H file provided defence to the f7 pawn. This helped as otherwise both my Rooks could be forked by Nxf7. Thankfully I was able to attack the Knight without worry of this happening or safe in the knowledge that if White did try it I gained a free Knight out of it.
183,5,17,1Nc4,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p2b1n2/7b/2NP4/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',The Knight retreats....
184,5,18,1Bb4,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/7b/1bNP4/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',The Bishop follows adding continued pressure to White to make decisions about his Knights.
185,5,19,1Ne5,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/1b1P4/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',A swap appears to have been offered however I wished to now remove the possibility of my Rooks being forked so chose to move the h8 Rook to e8 allowing it to see further up the field towards the center of play.
186,5,20,1Rhe8,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/1b1P4/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',The e8 Rook can now easily attack instead of being hidden behind pawns.
187,5,21,1a3,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/1b1P4/P1N1B3/1PP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',White makes the message clear. Swap pieces retreat or lose the Bishop.
188,5,22,1Bxc3,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/3P4/P1b1B3/1PP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',The swap is taken.
189,5,23,1bxc3,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N2b/3P4/P1P1B3/2P2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Though the swap is now complete and both players are points equal White must now contend with doubled pawns a weakness that Black could later target if they so chose.
190,5,24,1Ne4,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p7/4N2b/3Pn3/P1P1B3/2P2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',I decided to move the Knight to attack the c3 pawn and place a little bit of pressure on White.
191,5,25,1c4,b'2krr3/1pp2ppp/p7/4N2b/2PPn3/P3B3/2P2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',The pawn moves to safety naturally.
192,5,26,1c5,b'2krr3/1p3ppp/p7/2p1N2b/2PPn3/P3B3/2P2P1P/R4RK1 w - c6',Now I was hungry for a bit of action to occur on the board. I was preparing for the battle for center to begin by placing the attacking pawn on c5.
193,5,27,2Rfe1,b'2krr3/1p3ppp/p7/2p1N2b/2PPn3/P3B3/2P2P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',I don't know why White chose to move his Rook here. I can only assume that they didn't wish to do (dxc5) and give Black the open file for their Rooks. Either way this to would prove costly very soon.
194,5,28,2f6,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p4p2/2p1N2b/2PPn3/P3B3/2P2P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Upping the attack and pressure on White. I expected the response that followed.
195,5,29,2f3,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p4p2/2p1N2b/2PPn3/P3BP2/2P4P/R3R1K1 b - -',Naturally place Black's Knight under the same pressure as White's. Now if Black takes the Knight White takes back and points and piece equal again. The advantage however would be Blacks who would have access to the resultant open file first if they chose.
196,5,30,2cxd4,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p4p2/4N2b/2Ppn3/P3BP2/2P4P/R3R1K1 w - -',Time to begin the battle for the center. Black goes 1 up and White has no real option but to retreat the Bishop. If White takes back the pawn then Rxd4 White goes 3 points down and loses their second Bishop.
197,5,31,2Bc1,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p4p2/4N2b/2Ppn3/P4P2/2P4P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',The Bishop sensible and dutifully retreats.
198,5,32,2fxe5,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p7/4p2b/2Ppn3/P4P2/2P4P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',So Black takes advantage to go 4 points up and remove Whites last Knight.
199,5,33,2fxe4,b'2krr3/1p4pp/p7/4p2b/2PpP3/P7/2P4P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',White responds with the obvious move to take Black's Knight. However this now creates the open F file which Black can access first if they wish.
200,5,34,2Rd6,b'2k1r3/1p4pp/p2r4/4p2b/2PpP3/P7/2P4P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',However I saw an opportunity to place real pressure on White by checking the King so chose to move a Rook up ready to go round the stationary pawns on g7 and h7.
201,5,35,2Rb1,b'2k1r3/1p4pp/p2r4/4p2b/2PpP3/P7/2P4P/1RB1R1K1 b - -',Another questionable move by White in my opinion. That Rook is at best joining the fight on the 6th rank but the move to the B file itself does not assist White.
202,5,36,2Rg6+,b'2k1r3/1p4pp/p5r1/4p2b/2PpP3/P7/2P4P/1RB1R1K1 w - -',"So comes the Second check of the game. White has only 4 moves available here being:
Kh1 - response = Bf3#
Kf1 - response = Rf1+
Kf2 - response = Rf1+
Bg5 - response = Rxg5+

White's days have suddenly become very short indeed."
203,5,37,Rf8+,b'2k2r2/1p4pp/p5r1/4p2b/2PpP3/P7/2P2K1P/1RB1R3 w - -',Black checks again. This now leaves White with only one move before the game is over anyhow.
204,5,38,2Bf4,b'2k2r2/1p4pp/p5r1/4p2b/2PpPB2/P7/2P2K1P/1R2R3 b - -',The only move available at this point but White knows the game is over.
205,5,39,2Rxf4#,b'2k5/1p4pp/p5r1/4p2b/2PpPr2/P7/2P2K1P/1R2R3 w - -',"Checkmate is issued and White loses the Christmas game. How this came about I am still to ascertain as the moves I made leading up to this would normally have been picked up and stopped long before by Mattcarr.

This was definately one of my stronger games against Mattcarr both on Gameknot and offline.

206,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My first annotated game for the benefit of a learning friend...
207,6,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Alekhine's defence (B02). Not all that uncommon but interesting for a beginner.
208,6,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Mokele Mbembe (Buecker) variation.
209,6,3,Nb6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Steiner variation.
210,6,4,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/2P1P3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Two pawns' (Lasker's) attack.
211,6,5,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/2PnP3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Two pawns' attack Mikenas variation.
212,6,6,Bxc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4p3/2bnP3/2B5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Deviation from the book. (6. ... d6). This allows white the opportunity to control the centre as well as an annoying advanced centre pawn. The single pawn advantage of black is superficial and short-lived.
213,6,7,Bxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bBP3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Regained pawn.
214,6,8,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/2bBP3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Fair enough: opens up the diagonal for the black queen as well as forcing the bishop back.
215,6,9,Qa5,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/q1b1P3/4B3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',A bit premature.
216,6,10,d5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2p5/q1bpP3/4B3/8/PP1PNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',Would have been strong if not for en passant!
217,6,11,1exd6e.p.,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2pP4/q1b5/4B3/8/PP1PNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',At least there's no advanced white pawn any more right?
218,6,12,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2pP4/q1b5/4B3/8/PP1PNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Should have castled earlier instead of 9. ... Qa5 but at least no time is wasted now capturing the d6 pawn (It's black's anyway) plus there's a juicy central e-file begging for a rook.
219,6,13,1a3,b'r1b2rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pP4/q1b5/4B3/P7/1P1PNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Beware b4 (not now as there's 14. b4 Bxb4 15. axb4 Qxa1) but it's a possible future threat.
220,6,14,1d3,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pP1n2/q1b5/4B3/P2P4/1P2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Looking to un-double pawns and close off the open file while opening up the diagonal for the c1 bishop.
221,6,15,1Bb6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1bpP1n2/q7/4B3/P2P4/1P2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Bb6? Better is the long delayed Bxd6.
222,6,16,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1bpP1n2/q7/4BB2/P2P4/1P2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Oh dear. The advanced pawn lives.
223,6,17,1Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1bpP4/q7/4nB2/P2P4/1P2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Another blunder (see comment for 14. d3).
224,6,18,1dxe4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1bpP4/q7/4PB2/P7/1P2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',d6 is now protected by both queen and bishop; there's a d7 threat and white has both his centre pawns while black has none. Black's bishop pair is weak because... well they aren't paired.
225,6,19,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/pp4pp/1bpP4/q4p2/4PB2/P7/1P2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6',Weakening the king-side without being in the position to attack. Also ignored d7.
226,6,20,Raxc8,b'2r2rk1/pp4pp/1bp5/q7/4pB2/P7/1P2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',"White lost both centre pawns for that undeveloped bishop and also gifted black a centre spot. There's also pressure on f2 from both rook and bishop.

But e4 is isolated and the king-side is weak."
227,6,21,Rcd8,b'3r1rk1/pp1Q2pp/1bp5/q7/4pB2/P7/1P2NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',19. ... Qa6 would not loose the b7 pawn and would also attack e2 gaining tempo.
228,6,22,Rd2,b'5rk1/pQ4pp/1bp5/q7/4pB2/P7/1P1rNPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Outright loss for black. The game was recoverable until now.
229,6,23,2Nc3,b'5rk1/pQ4pp/1bp5/8/4p3/P1N5/1P1q1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The added pressure on f2 won't help now.
230,6,24,2Kh1,b'5rk1/pQ4pp/2p5/8/4p3/P1N5/1P1q1bPP/R4R1K b - -',Nice try but white doesn't have to comply with the trade. Black humbly took the f2 bait. Without even having to move a piece white's rook can now contest the f-file.
231,6,25,2Bd4,b'5rk1/pQ4pp/2p5/8/3bp3/P1N5/1P1q2PP/R4R1K w - -',Bd4!? And the f-file immediately wins it.
232,6,26,2Qb3+,b'5rk1/p5pp/2p5/8/3bp3/PQN5/1P1q2PP/R4R1K b - -',White enters the conditional moves 24. ... Rf7 25. Qb8 Rf1 26 Rxf1# and 24. ... Kh8 15. Rxf8#. Black resigns.
233,7,0,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I am sure that I will recieve many negative comments for this opening. However although this move doesn't do much for the centre or my development it can prevent a bishop check at b4 or a pin on a c3 knight for example. It may not be the best opening for white but I think it is sound. If anyone can prove otherwise then feel free to do so.
234,7,1,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/4P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I don't think was the best possible opening choice for black against 1. a3. I think putting the dark squared bishop on its long diagonal to attack my b2 square would have been better. Having said that I think this opening is playable and certainly isn't bad.
235,7,2,Be7,b'r2qk1nr/pbppbppp/1pn5/4p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I think white is slightly better here due to my active pieces. I think black is ok at this point but his setup is a bit passive.
236,7,3,Na5,b'r2qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p6/n7/2BNP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is almost certainly a mistake. Because of my first move a3 my bishop can now go to a2. The knight is now left on the outskirts of the board for the majority of the game.
237,7,4,Nf6,b'r2qk2r/pbppbppp/1p3n2/n7/3NP3/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',8. ...Bf6 with active bishops to compensate for his lack of space may have been better. White is now better.
238,7,5,Nf5,b'r2qk2r/pbppbppp/1p3n2/n4N2/4P3/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This may not have been my best move. I think 9. e5 with the idea of 9. ...Ne4 10. Qg4 Nxc3 11.Qxg7 Rf8 12. bxc3 was preferable.
239,7,6,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p3n2/n4N2/4P3/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Castling straight into my attack but the other options 9. ...g6 9. ...Rg8 and 9. ...Kf8 don't look great either.
240,7,7,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p3n2/n3PN2/8/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I thought I would kick the defensive knight before beginning my attack.
241,7,8,1Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/pbppbppp/1p6/n3PN2/8/P1N5/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',If 10. ...Ne4? Then 11. Qg4 will win the knight due to the mate threat on g7.
242,7,9,Kh8,b'r2qnr1k/pbpp1ppp/1p6/n3PN2/6Q1/P1N5/BPP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',This was to meet the threat of 14. Nh6+ Kh8 15. Nxf7+ forking the king and queen forcing black to give up his rook for my knight.
243,7,10,1Qh3,b'r2qnr1k/pbpp3p/1p4pN/n3Pp2/8/P1N4Q/BPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Black's pieces are totally misplaced. His queen's knight is on the side of the board controlling irrelevant squares his king's knight is obstructing the queen and the king's rook and is also on the back rank. The queen's rook has no active role either. Only the queen's bishop is well placed.
244,7,11,1Qe7,b'r3nr1k/pbppq2p/1p4pN/n3Pp2/8/P1N4Q/BPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',It was important to activate the queen and involve it in the defence but it is too late.
245,7,12,1Rfe1,b'r3nr1k/pbppq2p/1p4pN/n3Pp2/8/P1N4Q/BPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',All my pieces are now arguably better placed than their black counterparts.

As well as that I figured blacks going to aim for queenside expansion and this prepares that.
264,8,7,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3pbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I need to develop so I figured now was as good a time as ever I still didnt know what I wanated to do with my LSB but it seemed to me that its optimal square was yet to be revealied so its best to just develop my knight and decide later what to do with my bishop. this move also controls d5.
265,8,8,1Nh2,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP3P/PP2BPPN/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',At the time I thought that h3 was just a dont know what to do so how bout h3 sort of thing. It's not till after this that I realised it was probably to free the f pawn. though come to think of it the N could have simply gone to d2 instead of creating a potential target for black with h3.
266,8,9,1Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP3P/PP2BPPN/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',preparing the eventual queenside expansion.
267,8,10,axb5,b'1rbq1rk1/4npbp/2npp1p1/1pp5/4PP2/2NP3P/PP2B1PN/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',capture toward the centre.
268,8,11,Nd4,b'1rbq1rk1/4npbp/3pp1p1/1pp5/3nPP2/P1NP3P/1P2B1PN/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',finally planting the knight on its most natural square.
269,8,12,Nxe2+,b'1rbq1rk1/5pbp/2npp1p1/1pp5/4PP2/P1NPBN1P/1P2n1P1/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Generally I prefer bishops to knights however I think in this case this may not have been the best course of action. Perhaps b4 would have been more accurate?
270,8,13,Rxb4,b'2bq1rk1/5pbp/2npp1p1/2p5/1r2PP2/2NPBN1P/1P2Q1P1/1R3RK1 w - -',The pawn capture didn't seem appealing and this kept an eye on b2 prepared to potentially double up and meant the knight could continue to remain controlling d4.
271,8,14,Qb6,b'2b2rk1/5pbp/1qnpp1p1/2p5/1r2PP2/2NPBN1P/1P2Q1P1/1R3R1K w - -',Possibly risky putting my queen in line with the enemy bishop.
272,8,15,1e5,b'2b2rk1/5pbp/1qnpp1p1/2p1P3/1r3P2/2NPBN1P/1P2Q1P1/1R3R1K b - -',offering a pawn for pressure and tactics against c5 I think
273,8,16,Nxf3,b'2b2rk1/5pbp/1q2p1p1/2p5/1r2N3/3PBn1P/1P2Q1P1/1R3R1K w - -',There were a few options to take here For whatever reason I cant remember I went with this one.
274,8,17,Rxb2,b'2b2rk1/5pbp/1q2p1p1/2p5/4N3/3PBR1P/1r2Q1P1/1R5K w - -',Leaves me a pawn up.
275,8,18,Rd8,b'2br2k1/5p1p/4p1p1/2N5/8/3PBR1P/1b4P1/7K w - -',However there is a good chance I will be able to gain the isoloni
276,8,19,2Nf6+,b'6k1/5p1p/b3pNpB/3r4/8/3P1R1P/1b4P1/7K b - -',I had wondered if my opponent would try this. It forces me to give up the bishop pair but I think I would have done something else.
277,8,20,Rf5,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/5r2/4b3/4B2P/5RPK/8 w - -',I figured the two pawns would be enough to win the oposite coloured bishop ending.
278,8,21,3Rd2,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/5r2/4b3/4B2P/3R2PK/8 b - -',Apparently my opponent agrees.
279,8,22,3h5,b'6k1/5p2/4p1p1/5r1p/4b3/4B2P/3R2PK/8 w - h6',Seizing the pace while I can.
280,8,23,g5,b'8/8/4p3/5ppk/4bB1p/3r3P/1R4PK/8 w - -',Things would get difficult if I allowed White to play Rb8 whilst my pawn was still on g6.
281,8,24,f4,b'8/8/4p3/4B1pk/4bp1p/3r3P/1R4PK/8 w - -',Now I have blocked the white bishops access to g3. 
282,8,25,Rg3,b'8/8/4p3/4B1pk/4bp1p/6rP/5RPK/8 w - -',whites game is slowly becoming more difficult to play. the rook is confined to the 2nd rank and his bishop is having difficulty finding usefull tasks.
283,8,26,f3,b'8/2B5/4p3/5kp1/4b2p/3r1p1P/5RPK/8 w - -',I had been struggling to find the winnning plan the past few moves I had a good position but couldnt work out how to win when my opponent kept not making mistakes. So in the end I thought I had to do something active.
284,8,27,4g3,b'8/2B5/4p3/5kp1/4b2p/3r1pPP/5R1K/8 b - -',Just what I expected. It's what I would have done as well.
285,8,28,4e5,b'8/2B5/8/4pkp1/4b2p/3r1pPP/5R1K/8 w - -',This was incase my opponent played g4 it meant my king would be able to jump into f4. 
286,8,29,5g4+,b'8/2B5/8/4pkp1/4b1Pp/3r1p1P/5R1K/8 b - -',I was slightly surprised I thought gxh4 was more likely.
287,8,30,5Ba5,b'8/8/8/B3p1p1/4bkPp/3r1p1P/5R1K/8 b - -',Aiming for d2.
288,8,31,5Rd1,b'8/8/8/B3p1p1/4bkPp/5p1P/5R1K/3r4 w - -',?? However I must have been getting cocky and lazy because I had stopped putting any thought into the game thinking it was simply won. my opponent proved me wrong. Of course something like 51...Bc6 would leave me with a good game.
289,8,32,5Rxd2,b'8/8/8/4p1p1/4bkPp/5p1P/3R3K/8 b - -',So now material was equal but I still thought I had winning chances at this point. As well as that this was a team macth so I was going to fight to the bitter end.
290,8,33,f2,b'8/8/8/4p1p1/4b1Pp/4k2P/R4p1K/8 w - -',?? Another blunder that makes this a hundred times more difficult to win if infact there exsists a win at all.
291,8,34,5Rxf2,b'8/8/8/4p1p1/4b1Pp/4k2P/5R1K/8 b - -',Of course If I were to take the rook it would be stalemate.
292,8,35,5Bf3,b'8/8/8/4p1p1/6Pp/4kb1P/5R1K/8 w - -',Now I have my work cut out for me. 
293,8,36,Kg3,b'8/8/8/6R1/4p1Pp/3b2k1/8/6K1 w - -',I had done a heap of annalysis to reach te position last move and thought I had something winvolving a pawn push I then realised it was terrible as there was some error in the lines I had worked out. however I still thought this game was worth continuing.
294,8,37,Bd3,b'8/7R/6P1/8/8/3bp1kp/8/6K1 w - -',This had all been planned from move 62 however as soon as I did it I realised that Re7 dissolves the threats.
295,8,38,6Kh1,b'8/4R3/6P1/8/8/3bp1k1/7p/7K b - -',Still though I thought there was still chance for my opponent to make a mistake. A draw had been apparanet to me for a very long time now I think since about move 55 however I kept playing on in the hopes that white would slip up.
296,8,39,6e2,b'8/4R3/6P1/8/8/3b2k1/4p2p/7K w - -',Of course there are many many lines that eaisly draw for white but there is still a chance that an inattentinve opponent may fall into a mate. One can dream I guess.
297,8,40,6g7,b'8/4R1P1/8/8/8/3b2k1/4p2p/7K b - -',Definatly the best reply its what I would have done. It actually almost seems that this wins for white however blacks next move is the only move that draws.
298,8,41,6Bc4,b'8/4R1P1/8/8/2b5/6k1/4p2p/7K w - -',threatning mate. This was my last throw of the dice and I was desperatly hoping that white may play something foolish like Rxe2 or Re8 or even g8=Q (though come to think of it that would still draw after ...Bxg8 Re3+)
299,8,42,7Re3+,b'8/6P1/8/8/2b5/4R1k1/4p2p/7K b - -',No such luck.
300,8,43,Kxe2,b'8/6P1/8/8/2b5/8/4k2p/7K w - -',I was very impressed with the way my opponent played this game especially his never say die attitude. I learnt a very important lesson here about not getting sloppy as there is almost always chance for your opponent to slip up and miss the chance for a win.
301,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So he starts with the most popular
302,9,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',and I reply with my normal
303,9,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',In this case leading to a closed variation of the Sicilian although sometimes White follows up with Nf3 or Ne2 and following it up with d4 going back into the Open Sicilian
304,9,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So I keep my options open
305,9,4,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',and he confirms a closed Sicilian. An immediate 2. g3 is best met with d5 so 2. Nc3 prevent this
306,9,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So I can play this without any fear of him transposing into the Yugoslav attack against the Sicilian Dragon
307,9,6,Bg2,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',The natural follow up

309,9,8,d3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',He develops again
310,9,9,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is my usual in this variation planning Ng-e7 and d5 as opposed to the usual plan of playing for b5
311,9,10,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP2PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',He hits the c pawn

313,9,12,Qd2,b'r1bqk1nr/p2p1pbp/1pn1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Going for a king side attack.
314,9,13,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',So I continue to develop
315,9,14,Bh6,b'r1bqk2r/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',He plays very agressively
316,9,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR w KQ -',Calmly castling!
317,9,16,h4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR b KQ h3',On this the attack. He is already threatening h5 exchanging on g6 exchanging on g7 and Qh6 followed by mate on h7 but there are defences.
318,9,17,Bxh6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pnp1p/1pn1p1pb/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR w KQ -',So I take
319,9,18,1Qxh6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pnp1p/1pn1p1pQ/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K1NR b KQ -',He takes back
320,9,19,1f6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pn2p/1pn1pppQ/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K1NR w KQ -',Now h5 can be met with g5 and his queen is in risk. I also have the option of Rf7 protecting h7. Also I have a long term plan - now that black squared bishops are exchanged put all my pawns on white squares and then my bishop can weave in and out of them. Afterwards I found out that this was played in Perez Garcia H… (2255) vs. Lemmers Oscar (2385) black won in 61 moves.
321,9,20,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pn2p/1pn1ppp1/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR b KQ -',He decides the queen isn't doing much there
322,9,21,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pn2p/1pn2pp1/2p1p3/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR w KQ -',So I continue with my plan
323,9,22,1f4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2pn2p/1pn2pp1/2p1p3/4PP1P/2NP2P1/PPPQ2B1/R3K1NR b KQ f3',Another agressive move

325,9,24,1h5,b'r1bq1rk1/p3n2p/1pnp1pp1/2p1p2P/4PP2/2NP2P1/PPPQ2B1/R3K1NR b KQ -',Shredder assesses this position as +1.14 to white. Maybe my plan of putting pawns on black squares was too slow. Maybe I should have stayed with my plan of d5. What do you think dear reader?
326,9,25,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/p3n2p/1pnp1pp1/2p1p2P/4PPb1/2NP2P1/PPPQ2B1/R3K1NR w KQ -',With the idea of blocking the h file and also preventing him from castling. I was still reasonably confident.
327,9,26,1hxg6,b'r2q1rk1/p3n2p/1pnp1pP1/2p1p3/4PPb1/2NP2P1/PPPQ2B1/R3K1NR b KQ -',Of course if he had taken on e5 I would have taken on h5
328,9,27,1hxg6,b'r2q1rk1/p3n3/1pnp1pp1/2p1p3/4PPb1/2NP2P1/PPPQ2B1/R3K1NR w KQ -',Keeping my pawns together

335,9,34,1Qh6,b'r2q1rk1/p3n3/1p1p2pQ/2pPp3/6b1/3P2P1/PPP3B1/R3K1NR b KQ -',Shredder now thinks that white has a decisive advantage after the game Stuart said the same.....

394,13,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Veresov's Opening.  White usually tries e4 somewhere.  I later found out that Andrew has had decent success with 1. d4  2. Nc3 so I'm inadvertently playing into one of his specialties.  I think I'll try to get c5 in so that I can dispute the center.  Since I don't feel daring enough to play a gambit I'll set up with d6 first.  But I'll try to keep him guessing by playing Nf6 ahead of d6.  Then I'll move the c-pawn.
395,13,1,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Departing from opening theory with early pressure on c7.  I could stop it with 3. ...a6 but that's too reactive of a move.  I could even play 3. ...Na6 which is really cowardly and runs into trouble after 4. e3 (or even 4. e4?).  Perhaps I could indirectly answer the threat with 3. ...e6.  Then there is 4. Nb5 Bb4+  5. c3 Ba5.  Other moves that might work are Nh5 Bd7 and c5.  c5 does look interesting but seems kind of hair-raising.
396,13,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Drawback is that this shuts down the c8-bishop but that's not bad yet [3. ...Bf5 which I hadn't considered].

398,13,4,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/P1N5/1PP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq c6',Now Nb5 gets hit with Qa5+ 5. Nc3 cxd4 followed by Nc6.  On the other hand he could now try Nf3 e3 (best?) or dxc5 (then I have to play Bxc5 to avoid the solidifying b4).

I'm worried about e3 because it supports the d-pawn and guards the b5 square (now Nb5 can be played without worrying about Qa5+ and Bb5 can pin the knight if I play Nc6).  I was seriously thinking about playing cxd4 first to lessen the impact of an impending e3: 6. ...cxd4  7. Qxd4 Nc6; which isn't bad but helps to bring more of his forces out [6. ...cxd4  7. Qxd4 O-O  8. e4].

I either double his e-pawns or trade the bishops with doubled e-pawns.  His weak e5 pawn could then be reinforced with f4.  However there's something about the setup that I don't like the looks of.  Since there doesn't seem to be any immediate danger I'm going to hustle my king to safety.

Now Qa5+ a6 and cxd4 are possible.  9. ...Qa5+  10. Qd2 Qxd2+  11. Kxd2 Ne4+ 12. Ke1 prevents castling but the e4-knight gets shoved back after f3.  It's not a bad sequence but I don't know if it leads to anything tangible.  After 9. ...a6 he could try either 10. Nxc6 or 10. Nc3 and then I'm totally in the dark.  I'm also fumbling around after 9. ...cxd4 because he has many options (exd4 Nxc6 even cxd5).

Then 9. ...dxc4 started to look good.  It half-opens the d-file so that my queen now looks at the d4-pawn.  So if I play dxc4 I think there are 3 replies:
1.) 10. Nxc4 Bxf4  11. exf4 and I get rid of his strong bishop double his pawns and perhaps pick up the d4-pawn.
2.) 10. Nxc6 bxc6 (momentary tripled c-pawns) and if 11. Bxb8 then either Rxb8 to win a pawn or cxb5 which gives me a large Queenside pawn presence forces him to retreat the bishop (though he would get to keep it and thus hold the dark diagonal) and I also win a pawn; or if instead of 11. Bxb8 he tries Nc3 then I might either do 11. ...Bxf4 or 11. ...cxd4 and pocket another pawn.
3.) And the variation that worried me most of all 10. Bxc4 (endorsed by the computer).  I might have thought about 10. ...a6 because then 11. Nc3 cxd4  12. exd4 Qxd4 looks like it might work.  On the other hand if instead he first tried 11. Nxc6 then 11. ...bxc6  12. Nc3 (12. Bxb8? cxb5 ouch!) Bxf4 13. exf4 and I still win a pawn on d4.

Since that probably won't happen (I'm expecting 16. f5) then at least my queen is on a good square and I've opened d8 for one of the rooks.  It's slightly possible that I can then pin his queen like maybe after a timely ...c4 but I'll have to see how the position plays out.  If 16. f5 I can consider 16. ...Rfe8 or 16. ...e5 though I'm not so sure ...e5 does anything.  I don't know if 16. ...exf5 is good or not.

I can also swing it back to d4 if nothing less to stop Be6.  So I'm expecting the immediate 21. Be6 attacking both knight and rook.  Then 21. ...Nd2 could exchange exchanges and I'd come out ahead.

Rxe2 bxa3 (to prepare a possible Knight fork on c3)  27. bxa3 Ne4  28. Nd1 then it would be a tossup between Qf4 or c4.  I couldn't see that far ahead but it looked like there was no sizable edge.  I thought about moves like 25. ...Be4 25. ...Nd5 and 25. ...bxa3 without conclusion.


Then 25. ...Ne4 started to look promising as it directly attacks f2.  Then there is: 26. f3 Nd2  and after 27. ...Nxf3+ I pick up material; 26. Nxd4 cxd4  27. N goes someplace (like c2?) Nxf2 and whatever his 28th move is I can throw in Nxh3+; 26. Ng4 h5; finally 26. Nd1 Nxf2 wins a pawn immediately and may mess up the king pawns with Nxh3+.  26. Nxd4 may be the most complex and defensive line unless there's something I've overlooked (there was something but I can't understand it: the computer liked 25. ...Ne4  26. f4 which doesn't seem to help the defense after 26. ...Nxe2 does it?)."

I keep hoping that there will be a checkmate in here somewhere since my pieces are aimed all over his king; I haven't been able to find one yet (after his 29th move analysis saw a mate in 7 which would only have been avoided with the unappetizing Qxf3).

Kxe1 Qxg2.  It looks like his king escapes but I would have a large lead to work with (but it turns out that I missed 30. Bg2 Nd2+ which mates quickly).  I think this game had a lot of complexities at the onset and required more careful searching in order to find the right paths.

In this line the Black king bishop is supposed to make its way to g7.  I was at first figuring on things like a6 Bc5 or Nf6 instead with usual development so this is an early deviation from my game plan.  Nge7 would prevent doubled pawns in case of Bxc6 but it also temporarily leaves that KB on ice (therefore postponing castling) and puts the e7-knight on a less central square.  I don't know dude might be planning f5 at some point.
429,14,2,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',An aggressive move like d4 might work but I'll be cautious and develop a little more first.

I don't want to trade on c6 because that would let him bring the other knight up from e7 as well as free up the king bishop.  Retreating to e2 seems too passive.  Putting it on c4 will occupy a decent diagonal and focus on f7.  If then Na5 or b5 to attack it then I probably would be forced to send it back to e2 after all to avoid trading bishop for knight.
431,14,4,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1npp1/p1np3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I was bracing for b5 first.  Then it would have been either put the bishop on b3 and risk trading it off its good diagonal after Na5 or scurry back to e2.  Now I have time to prevent b5.  The bishop's current diagonal looks pretty good since the f7 square is lightly defended and he's still a few moves away from castling.  However h6 stops my knight from joining the fray.  And if he had played b5 first a Bxf7 sacrifice wouldn't have lead anywhere. [6. ...b5  7. Bb3 Na5  8. d3 Nxb3  9. axb3 Bb7]

And after I move the bishop he won't play c6 followed by d5 to contest the center because I could trap the knight with b4.

If 9. ...Be6 then 10. Bxe6 dxe5 (10. ...fxe6  11. Qh5+ wins another pawn).  His reply is probably the best way to continue.

502,16,2,c6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2ppb3/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A mistake.  Now I can take the e pawn force a queen trade and take away his castle.  The big lesson to learn here is that you and your opponent can both screw up early in the game. Don't make automatic moves in the first few turns. Really study what your opponent is doing and see if you can take advantage. If you can (and it doesn't really cost you development) go on the offensive early.
503,16,3,Nh6,b'rn1k1b1r/pp3ppp/2p1b2n/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',I believe that Nf6 was the better move but perhaps he didn't want the knight pin?  Normally I would prefer to keep my bishops in a game like this one with an open exposed king but the chance to double up his pawns on the kingside is too tempting to pass up.
504,16,4,Bc4,b'rn1k1b1r/pp3p1p/2p1b2p/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I made this move to allow a graceful exit for my knight threatening Nxf7 to fork his king and rook thus inviting him to exchange bishops.  However he decided not to play the game my way and I respect that.
505,16,5,Rg8,b'rn1k1br1/pp3p1p/2p1b2p/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',This move has some merit and was a decent response but it still allows me to exchange bishops.
506,16,6,fxe6,b'rn1k1br1/pp5p/2p1p2p/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',After this move I had a few options but felt that the best bet was to castle kingside and see if he would go for the doubled e pawns.  A queenside caste has some interesting implications but I think that a kingside castle due to his doubled pawns makes more sense long term.
507,16,7,1Rad1+,b'rn1k2r1/pp4bp/2p1p2p/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Getting this rook posted on an open file was a no brainer.  I was hoping that he would go to c7 and he did.
508,16,8,1f4,b'rn4r1/ppk3bp/2p1p2p/4N3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - f3',To protect the knight and and hopefully open up the f file as well.
509,16,9,1Bxe5,b'rn4r1/ppk4p/2p1p2p/4b3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Rf8 would have made things a lot more interesting.  As it is he manages to double up my e pawns but opens his king up to check allowing me to eat his two h pawns setting the stage for a crushing connected passed-pawn advantage.
510,16,10,Nd7,b'r5r1/ppkn3p/2p1p2p/4P3/4P3/2N5/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Not a mistake per se as he really needed to get his knight in the game but it does allow the pin and eating of his h pawns.
511,16,11,1g4,b'2kr4/pp6/2p1p2R/2n1P3/4P1P1/2N5/PPP4P/6K1 b - g3',Now is the time to start marching down this passed pawns.  He could bring his rook down to eat my c and b pawns but doing so will allow me to promote without true resistance.  If you have connected passed pawns march them down the field and make your opponent sweat.
512,16,12,1b5,b'2kr4/p7/2p1p2R/1pn1P3/4P1P1/2N5/PPP4P/6K1 w - b6',here he makes a play for the e pawn by trying to force out my knight.  I need to respond to this threat before continuing my march.
513,16,13,Rd8,b'2kr4/8/n1p1p2R/1p2P3/1P2P1P1/7P/N1P5/6K1 w - -',protecting my queenside is all done but now he threatens some interesting things with his rook.  I have a decision to make between advancing my g pawn and taking the e pawn.
514,16,14,2Rxe6,b'2kr4/8/n1p1R3/1p2P3/1P2P1P1/7P/N1P5/6K1 b - -',"This move is a mistake as I should have continued the march of my g pawn.  Even with this mistake I would still be able to promote my g pawn I would just have less total pieces left as a result.  

The best series of continuation is as follows:

25.	g5	Nc7
26.	Rf6	Ne8
27.	Rf8	Rd1+
28.	Kg2	Kd8
29.	Rf2	Ng7
30.	h4	Ke7
31.	Rf1	Rxf1
32.	Kxf1	Nh5
33.	Nc3	"
515,16,15,2Nc7,b'2kr4/2n5/2p1R3/1p2P3/1P2P1P1/7P/N1P5/6K1 w - -',A blunder allowing me to take c6 and pin his knight.
516,16,16,Rd4,b'2k5/2n5/2R5/1p2P3/1P1rP1P1/7P/N1P5/6K1 w - -',A better play is to put me in check with Rd1+ as it allows me the chance to make more errors in my play giving shamusb a chance to get back closer to even.  However Rd4 is a mistake as it will allow me to force a rook exchange which shamusb can ill afford.  However my response also has a hidden threat.
517,16,17,2Nc3,b'2k5/2n5/2R5/1p2P3/1P1rP1P1/2N4P/2P5/6K1 b - -',This move is good as it protects my e pawn but also threatens to get his knight for free.  The only good response to this play is Rc4 forcing a rook exchange however I hoped that he wouldn't see my next move and he did not.
518,16,18,2Kd8,b'3k4/2n5/2R5/1p2P3/1P1rP1P1/2N4P/2P5/6K1 w - -',A mistake and a critical one at this late stage in the game but one that can and often is overlooked by newer chess players.  I have missed many opportunities such as this in previous games which is one of the reasons I was able to see it here.
519,16,19,2Rxc7,b'3k4/2R5/8/1p2P3/1P1rP1P1/2N4P/2P5/6K1 b - -',"Herein lies the best teaching moment of this annotation.

If he takes the rook with his king I can play Nxb5 and get his rook with a fork. These types of moves are often overlooked by junior players and my opponent gave me a ""nice move"" comment after this one. The game was already over at this point but this move sealed the deal as it were. 

Take a look at where pieces end up AFTER the captures are complete and see if you can leverage a fork to regain parity. Often times people only look to see ""Oh that knight is protected by my king"" and don't think any further. As my friend mythas once told me dream a bit and see what would happen if a piece is no longer there or a piece can be made to move a square. Engineer those moments and you will be a better chess player and catch people off guard. I hope this little teaching moment was useful."
520,16,20,2Rc5,b'3k4/8/8/1pR1P3/1r2P1P1/2N4P/2P5/6K1 b - -',A blunder on my part.  I should have continued the push of my g pawn as the potential fork is still in operation but sometimes when we have an overwhelming advantage we don't always make the best moves to finish the games out as quickly as possible.
521,16,21,3Nxb5,b'3k4/8/8/1NR1P3/4P1P1/7P/1rP5/6K1 b - -',Another mistake as Nd5 was much better threatening the king.  One of the things that I need to work on is remembering that you don't always have to take the proffered piece right away.  Nd5 allows me two ways to eat his pawn and allows me to continue the assault on black's king.
522,16,22,3cxb3,b'3k4/8/8/1NR1P3/4P1P1/1P5P/8/6K1 b - -',
523,17,0,a6,b'rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',All standard stuff. I could have played c5 here but then the Bb5+ etc gives me a too known game. 
524,17,1,c3,b'rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here an unlikely move is BxN but nothing clear comes our of this positional sac.

526,17,3,Nb3,b'r3kbnr/1p3ppp/pqn1p3/2ppPb2/3P4/1NP2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',c4 closes the game too much and I will have trouble in activating my dsb.

532,17,9,1Nc5,b'2r2rk1/1p2nppp/pqn1p3/2NpPb2/1b1P4/5N2/PP1BBPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Now the right one was Rf-d8 but I overlooked Nd7. Just plainly.

788,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My opponent starts off with the King's pawn opening. At this point I decided to play an unusual but well-known opening.
789,27,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The King's Pawn Nimzovich Defence (B00).
790,27,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This wasn't one of the lines. 2.Nf3 and 2.d4 are continuations for this defence and 2.b4 is the Wheeler Gambit.
791,27,3,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B6/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Since my opponent wasn't doing anything much to my Knight (such as pinning the Knight to the King) I decided to strike back at his Bishop an unnecessary idea.
792,27,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Aftre this I chose not to chase the bishop any further but I am setting myself up to win one of his two pieces.
793,27,5,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2BnP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White's knight attacks my Knight but instead of retreating it I take White's Knight.
794,27,6,Qxf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Whatever I do I should never play e5 until one of those two white pieces moves away. In the meantime I am still trying to play d5.
795,27,7,c6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I expected him to do 6.Nc3.
796,27,8,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',However he chose to castle.
797,27,9,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq d6',I'm looking at 7.Bb3.
798,27,10,Qb3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1B1p4/8/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',I have no idea what White is trying to accomplish. If I had to take a guess it would be that White is trying to achieve Queenside control.
799,27,11,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/8/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',I prepare in advance the old-fashion Kingside mate. Unfortunately I started to worry about my opponent's attack.
800,27,12,1Bxd7+,b'r2qkb1r/pp1B1ppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Believe it or not this is another reason why I brought my Knight out.
801,27,13,1Qxd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1q1ppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',I couldn't decide which piece to take the Bishop with the Knight or the Queen. 
802,27,14,Bd6,b'r3k2r/pp1q1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/8/1Q1P4/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',Perhaps 11...Be7 was better.
803,27,15,1g3,b'r3k2r/pp1q1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/8/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNB2RK1 b kq -',This is another key detail about this game. My opponent created light square weaknesses that 1) he can't cover with his Bishop; 2) it is almost impossible for his Queen to cover these weaknesses in time.
804,27,16,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/8/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNB2RK1 w - -',I castle while I had the time to.
805,27,17,1Bg5,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/3bpn2/3p2B1/8/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/RN3RK1 b - -',Another useless pin but I overreact to it.
806,27,18,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/pp1qbppp/4pB2/3p4/8/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/RN3RK1 b - -',According to the pawn chain White should attack Black's Kingside and Black should attack White's Queenside. This means that White is attacking the wrong side of the board. 
807,27,19,1Na3,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/4pb2/3p4/8/NQ1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Instead of directing the Knight to the edge of the board White should have done 15.Nd2.
808,27,20,1d4,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/4pb2/8/3p4/NQ1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',I have no idea why I did this move but I probably was trying to prevent 16.c4.
809,27,21,1Nc4,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/4pb2/8/2Np4/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Not a bad idea here for White but he should be cautious about his next moves.
810,27,22,1b5,b'r4rk1/p2q1ppp/4pb2/1p6/2Np4/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - b6',I attempt to attack his Knight.
811,27,23,Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/p2q1ppp/4pb2/Np6/3p4/1Q1P2P1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',I prepare to advance my passed pawn.
812,27,24,1c3,b'r3r1k1/p2q1ppp/4pb2/Np6/3p4/1QPP2P1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 b - -',I think I overreacted to this threat.
813,27,25,1e5,b'r3r1k1/p2q1ppp/5b2/Np2p3/3p4/1QPP2P1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 w - -',At least I'm scouting for an open file.
814,27,26,1c4,b'r3r1k1/p2q1ppp/5b2/Np2p3/2Pp4/1Q1P2P1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Surprisingly White advances his c-pawn.

818,27,30,2a4,b'r3r1k1/3q1ppp/5b2/Np2p3/P2p4/1Q1P2P1/1P3P1P/R4RK1 b - a3',Why would I take this rook pawn...

821,27,33,2Qc2,b'4r1k1/3q1ppp/5b2/1r2p3/3p4/3P2P1/1PQ2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',If I were White I'd try 23.Qa4.
822,27,34,2g5,b'4r1k1/3q1p1p/5b2/1r2p1p1/3p4/3P2P1/1PQ2P1P/R4RK1 w - g6',I didn't know what to do so I plotted out a couple of moves.
823,27,35,2b3,b'4r1k1/3q1p1p/5b2/1r2p1p1/3p4/1P1P2P1/2Q2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',I definetely tried to get rid of the Queen (or chase it away).
824,27,36,2Rc8,b'2r3k1/3q1p1p/5b2/1r2p1p1/3p4/1P1P2P1/2Q2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',With this White chose to give up his b-pawn.
825,27,37,2Qe2,b'2r3k1/3q1p1p/5b2/1r2p1p1/3p4/1P1P2P1/4QP1P/R4RK1 b - -',25.Qb2 was better.
826,27,38,Kg7,b'2r5/3q1pkp/R4b2/4p1p1/3p4/1r1P2P1/4QP1P/5RK1 w - -',I rushed to my Bishop's aid using the King. It's the endgame right?
827,27,39,2Rfa1,b'2r5/3q1pkp/R4b2/4p1p1/3p4/1r1P2P1/4QP1P/R5K1 b - -',Now I can attack my opponent's light square weaknesses.
828,27,40,2Qh5,b'2r5/5pkp/R4b2/3qp1pQ/3p4/1r1P2P1/5P1P/R5K1 b - -',This move...does nothing.
829,27,41,2Rxd3,b'2r5/5pkp/R4b2/3qp1pQ/3p4/3r2P1/5P1P/R5K1 w - -',Perhaps 28...Rb5 is better.
830,27,42,2Ra1a5,b'2r5/5pkp/R4b2/R2qp1pQ/3p4/3r2P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',This leads to the key factor of this game the 8th rank. When White played the wrong rook he lost his control of the rank which I have a forced mate in two on. Also White's King's escape squares were lost when I played 27.Qd5.
831,27,43,2Rc1+,b'8/5pkp/R4b2/R2qp1pQ/3p4/3r2P1/5P1P/2r3K1 w - -',So White resigned while I had two ways to mate him. White had the right idea but he should have played 29.R6a5. 
832,28,0,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',An unusual opening the Carr's defence (B00).
833,28,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I carry out the decision to control the middle.
834,28,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Okay I have to admit my opponent wanted the center and probably wanted to play 1...e5 instead of the Carr's Defence.
835,28,3,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',By now I hoped that my opponent would play 3...Nf6 to at least start up some activity in this dull game.
836,28,4,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/8/3P3p/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It didn't happen. Instead he/she played a pawn advance which was illogical in theory.
837,28,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/8/3P3p/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',After playing this move I still hoped for 4...Nf6. Instead a shocking situation happened; he/she resigned!? I couldn't believe it! There were plenty of moves to play but instead they had to choose to resign. This was probably the most unreasonable game I have ever played. It's best to avoid doing a strange opening (excluding the Center Game Englund Gambit etc.) and know your selected opening well even if you selected a strange opening. Also the center is open for anyone and everyone should at least take the initiative. However there are some openings that don't take place in the center and they should be used cautiously and perhaps sparingly.
838,29,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"An odd move which is not even mentioned in the oddments columns of MCO14 Should be an interesting game This is where depending on sound guidelines for the opening rather than blindly following an opening book scores.

"
850,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My opponent chose a very sharp opening (King's gambit) but after 6.Ng1 (a very defensive variation) he lingered in the quest for an equal game at some point I even offered a poisoned pawn that he refused to accept and I went on to improve my space advantage on the king's wing undermining his blocking pawns and creating two connected passed pawns.. still I've had some trouble bringing them to promotion until a final imprecision by white precipitated the events allowing me to force the promotion he resign before!
851,30,1,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6p1/3PPp1P/5N2/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',after g4 Ng1 we will enter a very sharp variation were white hopes to get compensation for the sacrificed pawn on the weakness of black's g4 and f4 pawns black must keep the initiative and probably give back the pawn for some kind of advantage...
852,30,2,Ng1,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/3PPppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',now I think Qf6 might be a good choice defending f4 and preparing the long castle while at the same time removing the queen from the d column that might became open thus not allowing white to exchange queens if the d column opens up f5 Nf6 and Bh6 are other common choices

If he accepts then the bishop is no longer attacking my sensitive f7 square and I have time to attack his position with fxe4 and then possibly follow up with Qg5 if he takes my e5 pawn with his knight. If he declines my pawn offer then I have gained space made him move a piece twice in the opening and also gained the possibility of developing my light squared bishop to b7.

Ke7 takes away the the fork threat.

Taking the e5 knight is still bad for the same reasons as before.

Sin embargo desde una manera experta el enroque negro parece apresurado. Al tener el peón en h6 se genera un contacto de ruptura con otro peón blanco en g5 y Pilar podría lanzarse a un ataque sobre el Rey negro mediante Tg1 g4g5 y Dd2. La recomendación en estas posiciones es esperar a que el otro enroque primero ya que este plan con el Rey en el blanco enrocado no se puede hacer son preferibles entonces las movidas: [8...£d7; 8...d5]
