1,0,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',totally winging this opening - think I should have played c5 before Nc6
2,0,2,Qxa3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3P4/q1PBPN2/5PPP/2RQK2R w K -',questionable pawn grab - it's already apparent my opponent has all he needs to tear apart the kingside pawn shield
3,0,3,Ne7,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1np1p/5p2/3p4/3P3N/q1PBP3/5PPP/2RQK2R w K -',in anticipation - moving into g6 as a buffer
4,0,4,Qxc1+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/5pnQ/3p4/3P3N/2PBP3/5PPP/2q1K2R w K -',free rook - now if I can just weather the kingside attack
5,0,5,Qb2+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/5pnQ/3p4/3P3N/2PBP3/1q2KPPP/7R w - -',decide to set myself up for a retreat downwards - my opponent could actually force a stalemate here but he's higher rated and thinks his attack has enough punch but I can't find a win here yet
6,0,6,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/ppp2p1p/5pnQ/3p4/3P3N/2PBPK2/1q3PPP/7R w - -',a mistake - planning to give my king an escape should he knock out the f and h pawns and try a stalemate with the Q on the g and h squares
7,0,7,1Bf5,b'r1br2k1/ppp2p1p/5pnQ/3p1B2/3P3N/2P1PK2/1q3PPP/7R b - -',dangerous - capturing the bishop here is mate in 2
8,0,8,1Be6,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/4bpnQ/3p1B2/3P3N/2P1PK2/1q3PPP/7R w - -',a bit better - if I knock out the bishop I don't need the f7 pawn anyways
9,0,9,2Qxg6+,b'r2r2k1/ppp5/4ppQ1/3p4/3P4/2P1PK2/1q3PPP/7R b - -',going to lose some pawns here - note my opponent can still stalemate by just putting me in check along the 6th rank until we repeat the position 3 times - 
10,0,10,2h4,b'r2r1k2/ppp5/4Q3/3p4/3P3P/2P1PK2/1q3PP1/7R b - h3',a mistake - allows me to bring my queen back into the game and if I can trade them off I win
11,0,11,a5,b'r2r4/1pp5/5k2/p2p4/3P2PP/2P1PK2/5P2/7R w - a6',three passed pawns on the kingside - one passed pawn and a spare rook queenside - should be inneresting - LOL
12,0,12,Ke6,b'r2r4/1pp5/4k3/3p2P1/p2P1K1P/2P1P3/5P2/7R w - -',only safe bet - getting in front of pawn shield creates too many checks before I get to a1
13,0,13,Rdh8,b'r6r/1pp5/4k1P1/3p3P/3P1K2/2P1P3/p4P2/R7 w - -',should have moved King into f6 - even wrote myself a note telling myself to pay attention but failed
14,0,14,Rhf8,b'r4r2/1pp5/4k1P1/3p2KP/3P4/2P1P3/p4P2/R7 w - -',a recovery - I should be able to drive his K into the wall and move my king forward
15,0,15,Rh8+,b'7r/1pp5/4k1PK/3p1r1P/3P1P2/2P1P3/p7/R7 w - -',playing Kf6 is much stronger here I think and is faster
16,0,16,3Rxa2,b'8/1pp3K1/4k1P1/3p1r1r/3P1P2/2P1P3/R7/8 b - -',doh
17,0,17,3Ra8,b'R7/1pp3K1/4k1P1/3p1r2/3P1P2/2P1P2r/8/8 b - -',he's looking to play Re8  after I take the e3 pawn and pin the rook - notice as things stand I'm preventing a queening on g8 and his back rank is vulnerable - I'd have moved Re2 to slow me down - he's hoping I don't see the tactic but it's the only thing you can do going down there so I'm probably gonna spot it before the capture on e3
18,0,18,3Ke7,b'R7/1pp1k1K1/6P1/3p1r2/3P1P2/2P1P2r/8/8 w - -',now I get opposition too
19,0,19,4Ra7,b'8/Rpp1k1K1/6P1/3p1r2/3P1P2/2P1P2r/8/8 b - -',no good - only picks up one pawn
20,0,20,Kf6,b'8/1Rp5/5kPK/3p1r2/3P1P2/2r5/8/8 w - -',remembered f6 this time - LOL
21,0,21,4g7,b'8/1Rp3P1/5k1K/3p1r2/3P1P2/2r5/8/8 b - -',oversaw the mate attack -  I was thinking he'd play Kh7 but getting the pawn to g8 is no good - I play say Rh3 and the Queen has to block the mate since there's no retreat to the g file for the queen
22,0,22,4Rh3#,b'8/1Rp3P1/5k1K/3p1r2/3P1P2/7r/8/8 w - -',very enjoyable game - 
23,1,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',White shows his contempt for his lower rated opponent.  Is it warranted?  3... e6 is forced but here we reach the central discussion at hand.  White's bishop is useless in it's current position.  Should black play d4 the first chance he gets?
24,1,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/5Q1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I think there's a chance that 4... a6 is called for but white is attempting some serious pressure so why not make a move that also prepares for early castling if need arises?
25,1,2,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/3P1Q1N/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',As soon as black plays Nf6 or Ne7 he can play d5.  The white queen prevents it without the knight move.
26,1,3,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/2n1pnp1/2p5/2B1P3/3P1Q1N/PPPN1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black is free anytime he wants to play d5.  Traditional logic is that d5 expands the black center with a gain of tempo but is it really?  After d5 white moves the bishop (either to b3 or to b5) but didn't he want to anyway?  By white making a move he wanted to make the effect of the so called gain is negligible.
27,1,4,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/2n1pnp1/1Bp5/4P3/3P1Q1N/PPPN1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',"This move is a mistake but that's partly my point.  White tired of waiting for the ""expected"" move.  Now if I had immediately played Nf6 then d5 the knight on c6 would be pinned but because the c knight was developed first and d5 delayed black retains flexibility.  Unfortunately for white it only looks like the common line."
28,1,5,Nd4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/4pnp1/1Bp5/3nP3/3P1Q1N/PPPN1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',From delaying d5 black plays Nd4 with three threats.  White has to move the queen although he does have some say in the matter.  At the very least the bishop is lost.  I expect the best continuation on such a mistake would be 8.Bxd7  Qxd7 9.Qd1.  If black does anything less than Qd1 the rook is lost.  So why solve your opponents problems for him?
29,1,6,Qe3,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/4pnp1/1Bp5/3nP3/3PQ2N/PPPN1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White is already down but this is catastrophic.  Maybe if white was already castled or c2 was protected the idea of 8... Nxb5 9. Qxc5 Nc7 would get some activity out of the bishop loss to compensate.
30,1,7,Nxc2+,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/4pnp1/1Bp5/4P3/3PQ2N/PPnN1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',White resigns.  So while there is not a doubt that challenging for the center is essential we have to do it on our terms.
31,2,0,Kxf7,b'r1bq2nr/pppp1kpp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Jerome Gambit.
32,2,1,Qh5,b'r1bq1knr/pppp2pp/2n5/2b1N2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',He is going for the king. Not many moves to prevent and keep bishop and knight in play for further planning.
33,2,2,Qe7,b'r1b2knr/ppppq1pp/2n5/2b1N2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The winning move perhaps. Whites king is on e-line and a fork on Ng6! If he goes for it. I may have material enough maybe even legs to finish him.
34,2,3,Ng6+,b'r1b2knr/ppppq1pp/2n3N1/2b4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',And it comes. If I take it my rook is history but his queen will need at least 1 move to be back in action.
35,2,4,hxg6,b'r1b2knr/ppppq1p1/2n3p1/2b4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',So I go for it!
36,2,5,Qxh8,b'r1b2knQ/ppppq1p1/2n3p1/2b5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',And he is falling just where I wanted him to fall.
37,2,6,Qxe4+,b'r1b2knQ/pppp2p1/2n3p1/2b5/4q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Here we go! Now it is a matter of how long will he last!?
38,2,7,Qd4,b'r1b2knQ/pppp2p1/2n3p1/2b5/3q4/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2K1R w - -',Searching for mate in 1.

40,2,9,d6,b'r1b2knQ/ppp3p1/2np2p1/2b5/8/8/PPPP1qPP/RNBK3R w - -',another opening. Still his queen in the corner. Can�t do much from there.

A better move is: Nd4 followed by Nc3 then See puzzle 48635. "
43,2,12,1Re1,b'r1b2knQ/ppp3p1/2np2p1/2b5/8/7P/PPPP2q1/RNBKR3 b - -',What can you do?
44,2,13,1Qf3+,b'r1b2knQ/ppp3p1/2np2p1/2b5/8/5q1P/PPPP4/RNBKR3 w - -',once again forcing him to play my way.
45,2,14,Bf2,b'r1b2knQ/ppp3p1/2np2p1/8/8/5q1P/PPPPRb2/RNBK4 w - -',Mate in 2 perhaps but he will prolly struggle more.

I accepted it.  Little did I know that that would be the last time I would play in the Bury League.  Little by little I played fewer and fewer matches for my club.  I am still torn as to whether I should start playing in serious OTB chess matches again but feel I have enough on my plate with my correspondence chess.
61,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone this Rapidplay which took place on 17 September 1996 was the Bury St Edmund's Jamboree where each participant played 3 games of 25 minutes per side.  It was a traditional opener to the Bury League where various teams in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk would play one another.  There would then be four against four in the Bury League but that is another story.  I won one out of my 3 games and this is the one that I won.
62,4,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3. ................. Nf6 - this is the Two Knights Defense.  Bc5 would be the Guicco Piano.

65,4,4,Bd2,b'r1bk3r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/8/1bB1P3/5P2/PPPB2PP/RN2K2R b KQ -',9. Bd2 - I answer black's check by developing a piece.  Sets up a nice little discovery here should I choose to castle long.  If BxB then NxB clearing the way for queenside castling which I think is more appropriate now that the queens are off the board.
66,4,5,1Bxf7,b'r1bk3r/ppp2Bpp/2p2n2/2b5/4P3/5P2/PPPB2PP/RN2K2R b KQ -',10. Bxf7 - black eschews the bishop exchange but drops a pawn.

95,6,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black blunts the bishop's diagonal and prepares for an eventual d5.  One of the ideas of d5 is the black center expands with a gain of time but it seems to me that the quality of this is questionable because white would like to reposition the bishop anyway.
96,6,2,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"This could also prepare for an attempt to play b4?  If this is white attempting to prepare an escape for the bishop I don't think much of the move: 3... d5 4.exd5 exd5 5. Ba2?  After all 5.Bb5  can easily be met by 5... Bd7  Nor do I think much of an early Bc4 for that matter either because white has zero control over whether c4 will prove to be an effective spot for the bishop.  How much of an advantage is ""better developed"" if it's developed to the wrong square?"

One odd characteristic of Sicilian defenses (according to Alburt and Dzindzichasvili in Chess Openings for Black Explained) is that should the game progress to the endgame the endgame will tend to favor black.  Therefore preserving the black pawn structure is probably worth the extra effort.
100,6,6,cxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/1p1p1pbp/p3p1p1/8/2BpP3/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White expands his center.  A defense of the c5 pawn could could have been considered with b6 but the exchange takes a wing pawn for a center pawn.
101,6,7,Nxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/1p1p1pbp/p3p1p1/8/2BNP3/P1P5/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White takes the pawn with his knight.  I believe that cxd4 (I'm a little unsure as to when the defense is a pure or semi-Tarrasch defense) leads to black being able to force white into an Isolated Queen Pawn situation (7... d5) but neither alternative is clearly superior.  Top players attempt to use the IQP as a weapon as much as a liability.  The drawback here is until black plays Ne7 d5 will force both sides to accept the IQP.  White simply had the option of restoring his central pawns and declined.
102,6,8,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/1p1pnpbp/p3p1p1/8/2BNP3/P1P1B3/1P3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I believe Nc6 is standard here but black didn't want to contest the knight on d4 yet.  Ne7 allows Bg5.

One factor favoring a white king-side attack is the bishop on e3. One factor discouraging it is White's center not being firm. I've played a few games where f4 as white (f5 as black) was played against me and I survived because it wasn't prepared properly. I've also played games where I played f4 or f5. To me (for some reason I don't fully comprehend) f4 seems a little more natural than f5 but f5 actually is a fair response to f4."

White chooses the exchange and black decides to attempt to deny white the bishop pair.  If black were to take back with the e pawn he transposes into a pure Tarrasch defense by accepting the isolated queen pawn.  Now for white to continue there are a few interesting ideas offered by myself and others.  In the comments dmaestro suggests the complex  [A]12. Nxc6 leading to either [A1]12... Nxe3 offering the queen trade plus either knight or rook trade of [A2]12... bxc6.  I think worthy of consideration is [B]12. Bxd5 as suggested by ionadowman.
106,6,12,1Rxe3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3pbp/p1n1p1p1/8/2BN1P2/P1P1R3/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 b - -',White accepts the idea but this is bad for him.  The knight on d4 is very vulnerable.  If white is to accept the loss of the bishop pair why not do it on his own terms as suggested by 12. Bxd5?
107,6,13,1Rd3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3pbp/p3p1p1/8/2Bn1P2/P1PR4/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 b - -',White sees that 14. cxd4 Bxd4 pins and wins the rook for bishop.  Unfortunately this is only slightly better.
108,6,14,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3pbp/pq2p1p1/8/2Bn1P2/P1PR4/1P4PP/RN1Q2K1 w - -',The player apastpawn annotates this same game and he feels that Qc7 challenging white's light-square bishop was superior because if white saves the bishop the tempo used allows the knight to escape.  Personally it's a little hard to be too critical of an idea that cascaded into domination by black.

If I had played b5 white could not afford to lose more material and the upcoming rook harassment would have been met forcefully.  ionadowman says ""Hard to see the reason for the change of mind. The original plan looks good to me.""  He's right of course.  In the heat of battle we sometimes see phantom problems and this was the case here: I was worried about the bishop's retreat to f1 as in 23... b5 24. Bf1 Bc7  25.

126,7,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/3Np3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Here White deviates from the Three Knight's Game (C46).  He is hoping for the knight exachnage so he can place his WSB on d5 however this does hang the e4 pawn.
127,7,1,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/3Np3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black builds his attack on the knight.  His better move might have been to capture the e4 pawn.

131,7,5,1dxc4,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/3p4/3bP3/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is a great move for white.  It creates a double attack on black's WSB and lays the trap for the c pawn.  If black takes then Qc4 will capture the bishop.  If white would have taken d6 then he would find himself in a weaker position.
132,7,6,1Qxf3,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/3p4/4P3/2P5/5Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',At this point White has the one pawn lead but more importantly he has the two three pawn sets and still has the ability to castle to a secure position.  Black on the other hand has a restricted pawn structure and after a few moves he will lose his castling ability.
133,7,7,1Rb8,b'1r1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/3p4/4P3/2P5/5Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',This move is questionable.  It does pin the bishop to c1 for the time being however black might have been better served by Qd7 (to prevent white's next check move).
134,7,8,1Qc6+,b'1r1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/2Qp4/4P3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',Black has two options.  Move the king and lose any opportunity at castling or block with the queen.
135,7,9,1Qxd7+,b'1r2kb1r/p1pQ1ppp/3p4/4P3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',The queen trade works in favor of white who has both the pawn advantage and still maintains the ability to castle which puts his king a strong position and moves his h rook into the game.
136,7,10,1exd6,b'1r3b1r/p1pk1ppp/3P4/8/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White offers up the pawn trade to further weaken black by create to singular pawns on the queen side.
137,7,11,1Rd1,b'1r2r3/p1pk1ppp/3b4/8/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',White's main goal now is to trade down all the major pieces while maintain his solid pawn lead.  The rook move pins the bishop so black can either leave it there or move the king to free up his vital piece.  
138,7,12,1Re1+,b'1r2r3/p1p1kppp/3b4/8/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',To continue with White's plan of trading down material the check forces white to move the king and allows for the rook trade.  
139,7,13,2Bb2,b'1r2k3/p4ppp/8/2p1b3/2P5/1P6/PB3PPP/1R4K1 b - -',This move accomplishes two goals for white.  It attacks the BSB which can no longer be saved by black (because white is still trying to trade down material) and it allows the rook full access to the rank.
140,7,14,cxd4,b'1r2k3/p4ppp/8/8/2Pp4/1P6/P4PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Given the thread of this pawn and the possibly of black supporting it with Rd8 white attempts to move his rook behind it.  The next check move allows white the tempo to place his rook on e5.
141,7,15,Rd8,b'3r1k2/p4ppp/8/4R3/2Pp4/1P6/P4PPP/6K1 w - -',Blacks rook move to d8 is now weak.  White still with the plan of trading off all major pieces simple moves to d5.  If black decides to allow the trade the white king and cover the past pawn.  If Black decides to push the pawn then Rxd8  wins both the rook and the pawn.  If black moves the rook of D then he will just give up on the pawn.   All acceptable options to white.
142,7,16,3Kd3,b'8/p4ppp/8/3k4/3p4/1P1K4/P4PPP/8 b - -',At this point white has a strong end game option.   White's first goal is to place a pawn on both b4 and f4.  Once all of the pawns have been fully advanced these two pawns will then force the black king to retreat and allow white to both capture the d pawn and have opposition.  The opposition can then be leveraged to a point where white will be able to capture the black pawns and keep the black king a safe distance from his pawns.
143,7,17,h5,b'8/8/8/3k1p1p/pP1p1P1P/P2K4/8/8 w - -',White had hopped to reach this point on blacks move (having pushed f4 on move 32 put off his move count).  However by sacking the b pawn he can still obtain the necessary opposition and move to capture the f pawn.
144,7,18,4Kxd4,b'8/8/1k6/5p1p/p2K1P1P/P7/8/8 b - -',At this point black has all but lost asuming that white counts his moves correcly.
145,7,19,4Kd5,b'8/8/8/1k1K1p1p/p4P1P/P7/8/8 b - -',This is the key move to the end game.  If white would have moved Ke5 he would have allowed white to draw the game.  However the Kd5 request the Black's Kd6 which provides white the extra move required to secure the queen promotion and the win.

After this game which starts at 11 am there will be a break for lunch and then back at two o' clock for the final game.  After that there will be the presentation and then time to go home.
243,10,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',2. f4 - another Grand Prix!

It was after this game that Glenda went into her shell and from this day onwards she was either exchanged off early or if on the board seen defending things.  Hence she is known to me as Glenda The Defender.  However write here off at your peril my friends as every once in a while she can become Glenda The Offender!  Thankfully this was to be my only defeat in the tournament.
252,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone after a dinner break it was time for Round 2 in which I had the black pieces.  I decided to play the French Defence which was quite a usual response to e4 in my tournament games OTB.  I got the Winawer and played a rather unusual line against it.
253,11,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - this is the Winawer develops a piece and contests e4.
254,11,2,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',4. ................ Nd7 - prepares Nf6 and allows my pawn to advance to c5 at the right moment.
255,11,3,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',6. Nc3 - eschews exchange on f6.

257,11,5,Rb8,b'1rbqk2r/p1pn1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/P1P1BQ2/2P2PPP/R3KBNR w KQk -',9. ................ Rb8 - dodges the Wicked Witch of the West's attack on the long diagonal and prepares Bb7 which I play on my next turn.

Nd5  - NOW! - At the end of this rudimentary king hunt there is a vicious knight fork which will win white's queen.  Ding dong at last the Wicked Witch is dead! White throws in the sponge.  Time for tea and then Round 3.

1) f3 (The Yugoslav) - the most common response. White usually follows with Qd2
O-O-O and a full on kingside onslaught (h4g4 etc)

2) Be2 (The Classical) - a quieter move usually followed by O-O and the possibility of f4.

Better is Nb3 which brings the knight away from the bishops firing line and defends the queen-side preparing for a king-side counter-attack.

The queen also covers b2 and when the bishop moves black will be putting direct pressure on that square which will cause trouble for white no matter what side White will castle. The queen and the bishop are not in a battery they are working together very effectively. 

So why is this a bad move?

The answer is 11. Nd5! This forces the Queen away from the lovely b6 square. The queen now cannot protect both the knight and c7. Black cannot escape the position without losing at least a pawn.

Probably best is 11)…. Qxd4 Qxd4 Bxd4 Nc7  Kd8 Nxa8 Bxb2 Rb1 Bc3 . 
Black is a pawn down but the position is unclear.

This move is actually better than it seems as it forces the knight and bishop exchange which will leave white more open without the bishop pair.

However it just encourages black to centralise the knight and aim for the c4 square. f4 could be considered to prevent black’s knight from moving to e5 and attempting some king-side counter play. 

 Lines are interesting after Bxe7. White picks up a couple of pawns but Black has a massive initiative and can put a lot of pressure on the queen-side and relocate his knight to e5. Both players must be cautious as the position is rich in tactics and strategies. I strongly suggest that you play out this particularly interesting line to discover these tactics and strategies.

OR

17) Bxf8 Bxf8 b3 Qa3  Kb1 Ba6 where material is level but black has a huge initiative.

So there you have it! Not a flawless game but one which shows that although it is not used a lot by GMs today the Dragon is rich in both tactics and strategy and therefore arguably the most exciting opening in chess history!

This is not waiting for the executioner because when black does commit himself Henry is going to snaffle the black a6 pawn and try to crown the a pawn.

I did feel extremely nervous though.  After all I have only a little pawn to keep Henry company whereas my opponent has the mighty Wicked Witch of the West.  Now follows a series of checks.

If the black king tries to come to the Witch's aid then I will have no legal moves and therefore Gameknot will declare the game drawn for me.  My opponent would have no say in the matter (he declined a draw offer on move 58).

It was work the next day - thankfully my first task was filing which kept me busy until my coffee break.  At 1030 BST I got some coffee and a digestive and turned on to gameknot.  I looked at my active games list and saw two words that were manna from heaven - draw offer.  I made sure that my mouse was hovering over the Yes button and prayed that I would not get distracted at the last minute and accidentally decline the draw.  This did not happen and I clicked on the correct button.  Seconds later the game was drawn whew and double whew!

I did not get to deliver checkmate but I did net a big material gain as a result of it which did at least force eventual resignation.

To put the result of this game into perspective well it was my second game against Andrew that evening.  It was Andrew's first evening and he had an estimated BCF rating of 120 - translated into ELO above.  The first game which I played against him as black ended in disaster as follows:-

537,25,12,1Nd5,b'1r2r1k1/2p1qp2/2bp1npb/p2Np2p/P1B1P3/1P3Q1P/1BP1NPP1/1K1R3R b - -',In my mind the preferred trade from your point of view is knight takes knight. The reason I say that is that bishops are easier to manage late in the game. 
538,25,13,2dxc6,b'1r2r1k1/4qp2/2Pp1npb/p3p2p/P1B5/1P3Q1P/1BP1NPP1/1K1R3R b - -',Because of the way you managed the trade you end up losing another point and putting my pawn in an advanced position again.

543,25,18,2Bxd8,b'3B1rk1/4qp2/2Pp1npb/4p2p/P1B5/1PP2Q1P/4NPP1/1K1R3R b - -',in fact...I am sure had you noticed the bishop you would never had made that decision right?
544,25,19,2b4,b'3q1rk1/5p2/2Pp1npb/4p2p/PPB5/2P2Q1P/4NPP1/1K1R3R b - -',so I am now aggressively pushing my support of the c6 pawn

549,25,24,2d5,b'5rk1/4qp2/1PP2np1/3pp1bp/P1B5/2P2Q1P/4NPP1/1K1R3R w - -',OK an attack down the flank repelled by an attack down the middle...good
550,25,25,Qa3,b'5rk1/5p2/1PP2np1/3pp1bp/P7/q1P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K1R3R w - -',This actually put you in a strong position but at the same time you need to maintain awareness of my developing advance with the pawns. At first glance I think had you brought your castle over to a8 you would have threatened mate
551,25,26,2c7,b'5rk1/2P2p2/1P3np1/3pp1bp/P7/q1P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K1R3R b - -',instead I distract you frm attack by attacking myself

553,25,28,3Rxd5,b'4nrk1/2P2p2/1P4p1/3Rp1bp/P7/q1P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K5R b - -',All I have to do is contain you.

558,25,33,3Nd6,b'2Q2rk1/4bp2/1P1n2p1/4R2p/q7/2P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K5R w - -',because I am up 16 points you just can't get into an exchange situation...I can simply trade with you until you have no more pieces right?
559,25,34,Nb5,b'5rk1/2Q1bp2/1P4p1/1n2R2p/q7/2P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K5R w - -',this looks like a key error. your bishop is unprotected and I will have three pieces attacking your pawn on f7
560,25,35,3Qxe7,b'5rk1/4Qp2/1P4p1/1n2R2p/q7/2P2Q1P/B3NPP1/1K5R b - -',like so

655,29,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',3. e5 - this move which puts a cramp on black's centre and prevents Nf6 characterises the Advanced Variation of the French Defence.  Black does get some play for this as you will see.

I stayed for the presentation then drove back to Cambridge feeling satisfied with how the second day ended.  Considering that I was out-graded in all five matches 3 points out of 5 is not a bad show.  This has been my most successful congress although I did manage 3 points out of 6 games in a 30 minutes per side rapidplay in Peterborough the following summer.

687,30,12,3Rc8,b'2R5/6kp/6p1/p7/N2pb3/8/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',37. Rc8 - I am now a whole rook up but my opponent refuses to wave the white flag.  Mind you again my time management is letting me down I have 3 moves to make before the time control and I have less than 5 minutes on my clock. It is 40 moves in an hour and a half and then 15 minutes is added on when the time control is met.  Anyone who fails to make 40 moves in an hour and a half or whose flag falls at the end of the 15 minutes added on will forfeit the game on time.
688,30,13,4Kf2,b'8/8/2bk2pp/2R5/NP1p4/8/2P2KPP/8 b - -',43. Kf2?? - I quickly centralise my king but overlook the fact that my knight is hanging.  I only just managed to make my 40th move before my flag dropped so I have just under 15 minutes to make all my moves hence the blunder.
689,30,14,5Ra6+,b'2b5/8/Rk4p1/1P5p/1K6/6P1/7P/8 b - -',52. Ra6  - this simplification sacrifice will restore material equality but see my note to move 56.

708,31,17,4Rxa2,b'3r2k1/p3p2p/5bp1/8/3P4/6P1/R6P/3RK3 b - -',42. Rxa2 - here I give back a couple of pawns to simplify down to an endgame.  I am getting short of time on my clock.  I have made it to the time control but I have only the minimum time left 15 minutes.  I think I have sped up a bit since then but I used to get into time trouble a lot in my early games.
709,31,18,4Rxa7,b'3r2k1/R3p2p/6p1/8/3b4/6P1/7P/3RK3 b - -',43. Rxa7 - this capture is feasible because the dsb is pinned to the black rook.  I would therefore remain the exchange for a pawn up.
710,31,19,4Kxd1,b'6k1/R3p2p/6p1/8/8/2b3P1/7P/3K4 b - -',45. Kxd1 - simplifies further but my clock is ticking down.
