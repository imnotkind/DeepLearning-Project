70,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello everyone and thank you for giving up a few moments to see this annotated game :) This was a game i played in simultaneous chess against my chess teacher in chess club (i was not playing simultaneoulsly if you are wondering that). In a real game my teacher would play as white but he was so confident about winning all the games he put himself as black in all the games. I wrote down the moves against my teacher and decided to annotate it here.
71,2,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',If you are an intermediate player you might have noticed that this is the French Defence. This used to be my favorate opening but i gave up on it recently. while looking at the other games i noticed that my tutor played different openings against all of us (either it was the Sicilian Alkaline Defence or the French Defence.
72,2,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Here i wondered what would be a sensible variation to play. Maybe the Exchange Variation because of his strong rating but i have not really learnt it.
73,2,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I decided to play the Winewar Variation (i think i spelt it wrong) because it defends the pawn on e4 effectively and because it is favoured by GMs.
74,2,4,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This caused me some trouble. i have not seen this before. i knew that my e-pawn was in trouble and that i risk doubling up my pawns.
75,2,5,Nge2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"probobly not the best move but i chose it because:

1. it develops the knight.
2. if Bxc3 Nxc3 and my e-pawn is defended.
3. it stops my pawns from doubling up."
76,2,6,dxe4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b1Pp3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',i saw this coming but it did not bother me too much. my simple plan was to play 5. a3 Ba5 16. b4 Bb6 17. Nxe4.
77,2,7,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',damn! i did not see that Nf6 could simply be played to defend. it is never good to be a center pawn down against a Grade 189 chess teacher :)
78,2,8,Be3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',can't remember why i played it. I think it was because i did not want white to play Nc6 and put pressure on the pawn. i think i played it so Nc6 won't bother me too much.
79,2,9,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/3Pp3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',not a bad move to play at all...
80,2,10,Bb5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B6/3Pp3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',just hoping to weaken Mr. Briscoe's grip on the centre
81,2,11,Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p1pn2/8/3Pp3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',some candy for guessing why he played that move :)

84,2,14,1Bg5,b'1r1q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/1PbPp3/P1N5/2P2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',the plan is to exchange pieces and then take the undefended pawn with Nxe4. apparently this was quite a good move.

94,2,24,d4,b'1r1r2k1/p4ppp/6q1/4R3/1P1p4/P3Q3/5PPP/R5K1 w - -',good move to cause some trouble.
95,2,25,Qc2,b'1r1r2k1/p4ppp/8/4R3/1P6/P3Q3/2qp1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',after a few OK moves it reached one of the most complicated positions i had ever encountered. i had to look ahead quite away and so did white. my teacher told me he will allow me more time to make my move otherwise i might mess up.
96,2,26,2Qe2,b'1r1r2k1/p4ppp/8/4R3/1P6/P7/2qpQPPP/3R2K1 b - -',i thought this was the best move for me.
97,2,27,2Rbc8,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/8/4R3/1P6/P7/2qpQPPP/3R2K1 w - -',not so obvious at first but after a lot of thinking i saw it was a lost cause. the most i can do is stop the pawn from queening then go a rook down.
98,2,28,Qxe1+,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/8/4R3/1P6/P7/3R1PPP/4q1K1 w - -',personally i would have played Rxd2 instead of Qxe1. it puts black in a better position.

Also if d4 the knight can again come in on c4. Although it doesn't win a pawn it does look like a strong outpost for the knight. I chickened out and exchanged off one of his knights.

Bxe5 Qxe5 but then White has Re1 and if my queen moves there is a nasty rook check on e8 which is either mate or wins my queen.

207,7,14,1Rc8,b'2rbr1k1/pp3ppp/1n1q4/3nN3/8/PP1P2PP/1BQ2PB1/2R2RK1 w - -',Well if I can't recapture on e5 I may as well carry on with my original plan!

Qxf4 Bd6 27. Qxd6 Nxd6 wins a pawn and queen for the rook and bishop). I also ignored the threat to the d4 pawn.
382,16,40,2Bb1,b'5r1k/pnp3pp/1pbb2q1/8/1P1p1P1P/P4P2/3Q1K2/RB4NR b - -',Would accomplish nothing after 25...Qh6 (26. Qxd4 is possible but the f4 or h4 pawn would soon be captured) and doesn't even defend the pawn as will be shown. Better would be Ne2 defending f4 and attacking d4. (Trading those pawns would be advantageous for black.)
383,16,41,2Bxf4,b'5r1k/pnp3pp/1pb3q1/8/1P1p1b1P/P4P2/3Q1K2/RB4NR w - -',I was thinking of the game continuation but better play by white would have cut my advantage as the next note will show. Better would be Qh6 planning to trade the d4 pawn for the h4 pawn.

389,16,47,3Be2,b'7k/pnp3pp/1pb5/8/1P1p3P/P4r2/4B1K1/R5R1 b - -',Attacking the bishop with Rac1 would have avoided losing material (30...Rxd3 ? 31. Rxc6 Rxa3? 32. Rxc7 and 33. Rxb7 is obviously no good for black)
390,16,48,3Rxa3+,b'7k/pnp3pp/1pb5/8/1P1p3P/r7/4B1K1/R5R1 w - -',If white had immediately forced the rook trade the game would have been drawish; I would have been better not winning material with something like Re3 .

393,16,51,3Ba6,b'7k/pnp3pp/Bpb5/8/1P1p3P/4r3/7K/R5R1 b - -',Finally black is forced to play Nd6. I don't think Bg4 is any better as a5 is fine for black.
394,16,52,3Rac1,b'7k/p1p3pp/Bpbn4/8/1P1p3P/4r3/7K/2R3R1 b - -',Better is Rgc1 since it leaves open the future possibility of Rxa7.
395,16,53,3Rc3,b'7k/p1p3pp/Bpbn4/8/1P1p3P/2r5/7K/2R3R1 w - -',Better would have been trading the bishops instead with 33...Bb5 34. Bxb5 Nxb5. The game shows how well the rook overmatched the knight so my chances probably would have been better keeping the rooks on. The doubled pawns are also annoying for black.
396,16,54,3Rf1,b'7k/p1p3pp/Bpbn4/8/1P5P/2p5/7K/5R2 b - -',A waste of time with an easily spotted mate threat. White would be better to play Rc1 immediately or even better Bd3 after which would follow 35...Be4 36. Bxe4 Nxe4 or 35...Bb5 36. Bc2.
397,16,55,3g6,b'7k/p1p4p/Bpbn2p1/8/1P5P/2p5/7K/5R2 w - -',I was thinking it would be better to move the king to Kg7 while also advancing the g pawn slightly but moving the king laterally first with Kg8 may have been better.
398,16,56,3Rc1,b'7k/p1p4p/Bpbn2p1/8/1P5P/2p5/7K/2R5 b - -',Now Bd3 is not as good because the trade can take place on b5 instead since the bishop would be pinned.
399,16,57,3Bb5,b'7k/p1p4p/Bp1n2p1/1b6/1P5P/2p5/7K/2R5 w - -',The only way to avoid losing material.

411,16,69,a5,b'8/8/1pp3k1/pn4p1/1P6/2pK4/8/6R1 w - a6',It may have been better to lose the doubled c pawn with a6 and 46...Nc7 rather than trading these two pawns for the one white pawn. When I first made this move I was thinking 46. bxa5 bxa5 47. Ra1 g4 48. Rxa5 g3 49. Ra1 Kg5 50. Rg1 Kg4 which I believe is winning for black. From this point Toga evaluated the position at 0.00 except when white made errors.
412,16,70,4Ra1,b'8/8/2p3k1/pn4p1/8/2pK4/8/R7 b - -',Better is stopping the a pawn with Rg4.

416,16,74,Kf3,b'6R1/8/2pn4/8/8/2K2kp1/8/8 w - -',With the idea of getting the knight on e4 hopefully while the white rook is moving.
417,16,75,5Rf8+,b'5R2/8/2pn4/8/8/2K2kp1/8/8 b - -',A simpler draw is Kd4 where 56...Ne4 fails to 57. Rf8  and 58. Kxe4 and otherwise the black knight cannot help the g pawn advance before the c pawn is captured.
418,16,76,Kf4,b'6R1/8/2p5/8/2K1nk2/6p1/8/8 w - -',Kf3 allows an easier draw with 59. Rf8  and 60. Kd4 (59...Ke3 obviously accomplishes nothing)
419,16,77,6Rd8,b'3R4/8/2p5/8/2K1n1k1/6p1/8/8 b - -',White's first missed draw. Kd4 or Kd3 should have been the only drawing moves. Kd4 is easier as after 60...Nd6 61. Rg8  Kf4 62. Rxg3 the white king will capture the c pawn and after 60...Ng5 61. Ke3 the king can stop the g pawn and the c pawn will pose no problem.
420,16,78,6Rd1,b'8/8/2p5/8/2K1n1k1/8/6p1/3R4 b - -',Forced.
421,16,79,6Kf3,b'8/8/2p5/8/2K1n3/5k2/6p1/3R4 w - -',My first missed win. Winning is 61...Nd2  with something to the effect of 62. Kb4 (Kc5 allows 63...g1=Q ) Nf1 63. Rd7 (or similar) Ng3 64. Rd1 Kh3 65. Rg1 Nf5 66. Kc5 Ne7 and now when the rook sacrifices itself the c pawn is safe. Other variations include the rook not being able to sacrifice itself.
422,16,80,6Kd4,b'8/8/2p5/8/3Kn3/5k2/6p1/3R4 b - -',White's second missed draw. 62. Rg1 Kf2 (62...c5 63. Kd5 64. Rxg2  and 65. Kxe4; 62...knight moves 63.

Kc5 and both pawns will be captured; 63...c5 and the rook can move along the first rank while black can do nothing if the pawn promotes Kd5 finishes the draw; black king moves don't help) 64. Rxg1 Kxg1 65. Kd4 and 66. Kc5
423,16,81,6c5+,b'8/8/8/2p5/3Kn3/5k2/6p1/3R4 w - -',Ng3 is probably an easier win; after 63...Nf1 (63. Rg1 Kf2 or 63. Rd3  accomplish nothing) black's rook can't stop the pawn.

429,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The story of this game: Black recovers from some opening mistakes holding a difficult defensive position for a while. White tries a sacrifice to break black's defenses and black manages to make the material advantage from the sacrifice count in his favor rather than white's.
430,17,1,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',This takes us a bit off the beaten path but still with well-known popular responses for white. White will turn the move into an attack.
431,17,2,Nb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This sets up the threat of Nd6  Bxd6 Qxd6. Black however is completely unaware of the hole.

It's safer than usual because the queens and 2 minor pieces have already been exchanged away. From here on out exchanges benefit black precisely because they make the centralized king more of a help and less of a problem.

The alternative is to lose the d pawn and any pretense of central control."

471,17,42,e3,b'8/8/6bP/4K3/8/4pk2/8/8 w - -',White is now unable to force the bishop off the h7-b1 diagonal. h7 is now met by Bxh7 whether or not the white king will recapture.
472,17,43,Bb1,b'8/8/5K1P/8/8/4pk2/8/1b6 w - -',
473,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Ok the first rule of chess is that white always moves first. This is a very important rule that goes back years and years to a time when people were a bunch of racistist. 
474,18,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',wait a second... what colour am i?
475,18,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',oh yeah i'm black. Good. That was him moving his horse. Ok Ok. Rule number two. Always research your opponent for strengths and weaknesses. 
476,18,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Today i am up against a solid 1500 player called volhouder. I checked out his profile. He's Dutch and looks just like Sven goran Erikson. He might be interested in football? I could post messages on this topic to distract him at a crucial stage. I'll add this to my chess notes at the side of the board.
477,18,4,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the first things i noticed about Volhouder is that he is pretty old. About 70. So hes got lots of good chess experience. 
478,18,5,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Having said that old people do tend to make silly mistakes. Like my dad for instance. He kept forgetting to take his keys when he left his house and ended up having to smash the front door down like 3 times in a week or something
479,18,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',There's no use trying unorthodox fancy moves against someone with as much experience as volhouder. The guys probably seen just about every chess move there is. I'm going to play it nice and safe for the mean time.
480,18,7,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Moving my pawn up stops him moving his horse into g5. He'd then be in a threatening position for a check with his bishop
481,18,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Ok now he's moved his other horse out. He is starting to 'develop' by getting his major pieces off the back line. Apparently it is good to 'develop' early on. Someone told me this. Although i'm yet to see any real evidence that this is true.
482,18,9,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Ok i think this was my first mistake... i've broken my back line and started to develop as well. Before i had all my major pieces in a nice straight line. Seriously though... moving my bishop to b7 is a good move against the less experienced chess players like children or drunk people. They often forget about pieces in the corners so try to cram as many pieces in there for a surprise attack. This is a good move against anyone with a rating of 1100 or lower.
483,18,10,d3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"Unfortunately for me though my opponent is of a much higher standard. Asking the obvious question... why did i bother making this move?
Ok anyway he has now moved his pawn up to d3. This provides further support to his pawn on e4 that my bishop was attacking. It also allows his black bishop to come out and develop/attack if he wants"
484,18,11,a6,b'rn1qkbnr/1bp2pp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I'm now building a safe area to castle into. If i choose to castle that side my king will be well protected...  Apparently it's important to castle in the first 12 moves. I'd like to disagree with this statement but i've lost track of the number of games i've messed up through NOT castling early enough
485,18,12,a3,b'rn1qkbnr/1bp2pp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',still no pieces taken and there are no obvious signs that things will change in the next few moves
486,18,13,Ne7,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1npp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Hopefully volhouder will forget his house keys like my dad. That way he might time out. 
487,18,14,Be3,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1npp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"I love it when your opponents times out. You win the game without even having to think or nothing. Remember kids… it’s the winning that really matters not the taking part. No one likes a loser

488,18,15,g6,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1np2/pp1p2pp/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Ok so he now has both horses and bishops out and in play. In good attacking positions. One of my horses is blocking in my bishop. Can't really go anywhere either. I'll have to move a pawn to free the bishop up. g6
489,18,16,d4,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1np2/pp1p2pp/4p3/2BPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',i think he wants to get rid of my central pawns. I'm currently in no position to castle and do not want to lose my middle pawns as it will leave my king vulnerable. time to bring in some extra support
490,18,17,f6,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1n3/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2BPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I know it's hard to believe but i actually don't really know that much about chess. However i'm pretty sure that it's NOT a good idea to have moved three pawns all up one space like i have on the right hand side of the board. I would also imagine that most good chess players would tell you that white is in a much stronger position at this stage 
491,18,18,1Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/1bp1n3/pp1pBppp/4p3/3PP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',never saw that coming... don't know what he is playing at but i sure as hell don't like it
492,18,19,1Bg7,b'rn1qk2r/1bp1n1b1/pp1pBppp/4p3/3PP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',oh yeah great move... how has that bloody helped? Don't know what i was thinking there?
493,18,20,1d5,b'rn1qk2r/1bp1n1b1/pp1pBppp/3Pp3/4P3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Ok now i'm feeling really uncomfortable. Not a good position to be in at all. I don't have any pawns to force his bishop to retreat as i moved them all up like a crazy person. He has now supported it with a pawn and gained total control of the middle of the board.
494,18,21,1Nd7,b'r2qk2r/1bpnn1b1/pp1pBppp/3Pp3/4P3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',That last comment about gaining total control of the middle of the board might well be rubbish. I once heard someone say that in reference to a game of chess and i think it kind of fits this game??? Yeah so i just threw it in there to try and sound clever. Anyway i've moved my horse to d7. I now remember why i moved my black bishop to g7. It means my knight can move back to f8 and get rid of that bishop
495,18,22,1Bxd7+,b'r2qk2r/1bpBn1b1/pp1p1ppp/3Pp3/4P3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Looks like he decided to swap sooner than i had expected. It was a good move actually. Otherwise I would have moved my knight back to f8 attacking his bishop. His white bishop would have been unable to retreat safely due to my solid line of pawns on the right. If i had then swapped my knight for his bishop on e6 he would have found it very difficult to get any support up to his loan pawn sitting on e6. Not sure if any of that makes sense? I think i've just very badly over explained a move which never happened....
496,18,23,1Qxd7,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p1ppp/3Pp3/4P3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',obvious swap. I've managed to get rid of the bishop at the expense of one of my knights. I also now have the option to castle on either side. Both sides are well protected with my bishops and pawns. I can wait to see which side is safer as the game develops later on. 
497,18,24,1Ne2,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p1ppp/3Pp3/4P3/P3BN1P/1PP1NPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',ok what you won't have realised at this stage is that i had referred to my chess notes a couple of moves back and had begun to engaging volhouder in several football/Sven goran erikson type questions. This tactic obviously worked in distracting him as that last move wasn't the best
498,18,25,1f5,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p2pp/3Ppp2/4P3/P3BN1P/1PP1NPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Actually i made that all up. I didn't post any comments to him all game. Wish i had though. Maybe i can use that tactic at a later date though. i can also see why he moved his knight back. He obviously wanted to advance his pawn on c2 to give more support to his pawn on d5. My white bishop is attacking this piece and i want to try and remove his support in the centre. Hence my move to f5
499,18,26,1exf5,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p2pp/3PpP2/8/P3BN1P/1PP1NPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',What i wanted and expected. I can now take that pawn with one of three pieces. I don't want to leave one pawn by itself out on the right so i better use my queen or my horse
500,18,27,1gxf5,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p3p/3Ppp2/8/P3BN1P/1PP1NPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',..... i was pretty sure i didn't use the pawn... Oh well another fine example demonstrating how much of a rubbish chess player i am... I honestly don't know how i ever bloody win a game? Maybe i had a good reason for it. If i did i certainly can't think of it now. Oh yeah but wait... His pawn on d5 is now ready for the taking. He's going to have to get some extra support up to that.
501,18,28,1Nc3,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p3p/3Ppp2/8/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"ok... now given my current chess ability i don't like to criticise other players too much. The phrase ""Don't throw stones in glass houses"" springs to mind. But that last move of his wasn't the best. For a start he just moved that away from there. So he's wasted two moves at a pretty crucial stage in the game. I can also push my pawn up to e4 threatening his other knight and also freeing up my black bishop"
502,18,29,1e4,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p3p/3P1p2/4p3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',yeap. I can start to see why i used that pawn to take f5 rather than the queen or knight. he's going to have to move his knight. I can then take his other knight with my bishop destroying his pawn formation on the left and leaving his pawn on d5 for the taking
503,18,30,1Nh2,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1b1/pp1p3p/3P1p2/4p3/P1N1B2P/1PP2PPN/R2QK2R b KQkq -',never the best idea to move knights to the edge of the board. He can now only move that piece to one space.
504,18,31,1Bxc3+,b'r3k2r/1bpqn3/pp1p3p/3P1p2/4p3/P1b1B2P/1PP2PPN/R2QK2R w KQkq -',check

506,18,33,1Nxd5,b'r3k2r/1bpq4/pp1p3p/3n1p2/4p3/P1P1B2P/2P2PPN/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Yeah i don't think you can change them into another pawn actually. It would be good if you could though. A reverse pawn that goes the opposite way. That way you could try to get it all the way back again to your own back line. Ok enough of that nonsense i could have taken the pawn with my white bishop but by using the knight i am threatening his other pawn on c3 
507,18,34,1Bd2,b'r3k2r/1bpq4/pp1p3p/3n1p2/4p3/P1P4P/2PB1PPN/R2QK2R b KQkq -',My biggest trouble with chess is thinking forward to future moves and anticipating peoples next moves. You could say that it's the core to being good at chess. Either way... i'm sh*t at it. That's why i would have made the same move he just did
508,18,35,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1bpq4/pp1p3p/3n1p2/4p3/P1P4P/2PB1PPN/R2QK2R w KQ -',ok i've now decided to castle. My right hand side is wide open. So obviously i've gone to the left where my king will be well protected
509,18,36,1Nf1,b'2kr3r/1bpq4/pp1p3p/3n1p2/4p3/P1P4P/2PB1PP1/R2QKN1R b KQ -',probably for the best. That piece was doing nothing there
510,18,37,1Qg7,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/3n1p2/4p3/P1P4P/2PB1PP1/R2QKN1R w KQ -',Ok now i really should have done this move before castling. As it happens it hasn't really made any difference but i gave him the chance to stop it had he seen it. My queen is now attacking his pawn on g2 which he will not want to let me take but it is also attacking his pawn along with my knight on c3. I'm going to go  2 up either way
511,18,38,Nxc3,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/5p2/4p3/P1n4P/2PB1PP1/R2QKNR1 w Q -',obviously he won't take my knight as i would then come down and check him with my queen. He'd then have to move his king. Although having said that he can't really castle anymore anyway
512,18,39,2Qc1,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/5p2/4p3/P1n4P/2PB1PP1/R1Q1KNR1 b Q -',at this stage i figured i better move my knight. If he gets his queen into b2 i'll be in trouble
513,18,40,2Na4,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/5p2/n3p3/P6P/2PB1PP1/R1Q1KNR1 w Q -',yeah i know i said you shouldn't put your knight on the edge of the board but i must have had a good reason for it at the time... surely?
514,18,41,2Ng3,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/5p2/n3p3/P5NP/2PB1PP1/R1Q1K1R1 b Q -',ok ok now watch carefully. I'm about to pull of a special trick which is very uncommon amongst the 1500  rated players. As far as i'm aware i'm one of the very few chess players to have truly mastered this skill.
515,18,42,2f4,b'2kr3r/1bp3q1/pp1p3p/8/n3pp2/P5NP/2PB1PP1/R1Q1K1R1 w Q -',Yeap... it's the art of giving your pieces away for no good reason.

518,18,45,2Qc3+,b'2kr1r2/1bp5/pp1p3B/8/n3p3/P1q3NP/2P2PP1/R1Q1K1R1 w Q -',now luckily this move was available otherwise i probably would have just resigned in disappointment/frustration.
519,18,46,2Bd2,b'2kr1r2/1bp5/pp1p4/8/n3p3/P1q3NP/2PB1PP1/R1Q1K1R1 b Q -',I've managed to save my castle and i'm still in better shape than him on the board. It's all even but my king is well protected and my castles are linked up on the back line.  His king is stuck in the middle  and pretty exposed
520,18,47,2Qc5,b'2kr1r2/1bp5/pp1p4/2q5/n3p3/P5NP/2PB1PP1/R1Q1K1R1 w Q -',ok it's pretty obvious what i'm going for here. But there is still no harm in trying. He might make a mistake and mess up

533,18,60,3d5,b'2kr1r2/2p5/1p6/p2p4/n3p3/P3B2P/2P1KPP1/R5R1 w - -',ok now i'm bored of typing. I've got a pretty short attention span... not the best quality for playing chess. Anyway i probably won't post another comment for a few moves. You just have a look at the board and guess what i would have said.
534,18,61,Rxg5,b'2k5/2p5/1pr5/p5r1/3p2P1/P3pP1P/2P5/1R1K3R w - -',not a lot has happened has it.... lots of moving my castles with no real change to the board
535,18,62,Rxb3,b'2k5/2p5/1p1r4/p7/3p2P1/Pr2pP1P/2P4R/3K4 w - -',ok i realise i probably should have moved my other castle to c6 rather than exchanging on b3. This would have made it easier to take his pawns on the left. Certainly the one on a3
536,18,63,d3,b'2k5/2p5/1p1r4/p7/6P1/PP1ppP1P/7R/3K4 w - -',I think i got carried away with the thought of promoting one of my pawns. I guess you could say i was overconfident at this stage
537,18,64,Rf4,b'2k5/2p5/8/pp3P2/5rP1/PP1pp2P/8/3K3R w - -',at this stage i thought i was easily going to win
538,18,65,5Ke1,b'2k5/2p5/8/pp3P2/5rP1/PP1pp2P/8/4K2R b - -',i had it all planned out in my head
539,18,66,5h5,b'2k5/8/8/1pp2P1P/pP4P1/P3p3/3p1r2/3K3R b - -',at this stage i realised i'd probably f*cked it up. 
540,18,67,5c4,b'2k5/8/8/1p3P1P/pPp3P1/P3p3/3p1r2/3K3R w - -',but on closer inspection i realised it wasn't as bad as i first thought. Believe it or not i'm quite good at end games. It's all the chess before that which i'm a bit of a liability at.
541,18,68,5h7,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P1p1p3/3p1r2/3K3R b - -',the clever move is coming in a minute
542,18,69,5e2+,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P1p5/3ppr2/3K3R w - -',wait for it...

544,18,71,6Rh2,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P1p5/2Kpp2r/7R w - -',there.... Ok so it's not that clever but it still does the trick. If i had pushed my pawn on e2 forward he would have queen'd up on h8 putting me in check and gaining the advantage. By moving my castle to h2 i'm forcing his castle off the back line. Allowing me to get a queen and put him in check at the same time.
545,18,72,6Rxh2,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P1p5/2Kpp2R/8 b - -',now i guess he could have pushed his pawn up putting me in check first and then swapped castles... but that would have just delayed the out come. So to would have moving his castle to another square on the back line. 
546,18,73,6d1=Q+,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P1p5/2K1p2R/3q4 w - -',now if i'd have had any style i would have promoted that pawn to a bishop. But i don't. And i like to make sure i win. After all winning is the most important part of chess (see 'golden rule'). It also would have been a little insulting and cheeky to my very talented opponent who probably deserved to win this game.

548,18,75,6Kb2,b'2k5/7P/8/1p3P2/pP4P1/P7/1K5R/3qq3 b - -',i guess i got lucky on a few occasions. It could have very easily been volhouder winning this game. I recommend challenging him to a game sometime. Just make sure you don't use my tactics about mentioning Sven Goran Erikson. I'm saving that for the much anticipated rematch ;)

550,19,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My favorite move of all time. Most likely when people play against me you'll see me play this move at all times. I don't like playing e4 because I don't like seeing main openings that usually involve way too much theory such as Sicilian Defence or Ruy Lopez and much more.
551,19,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',When my opponent played this move I thought about two openings that I could play against. If I play e4 we could go into a Caro Kann which is a very boring opening to play against to me or we could play against the Slav Defence which is something I'm more prepare of playing against since I know mostly all moves after d4
552,19,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Trying to pin my knight down so it wont get any play during the game
553,19,3,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',"When my opponent play this move now for some reason I thought about the Nimzo Indian but the only difference is that c5 haven't been played until later on during the game. So I said to myself ""why not play into a Nimzo Indian game"" type of step up."
554,19,4,Nge2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1p1p/2p1pnp1/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',At this point of the game I was happy with my position because if you notice that my pieces at developing smoothly into the game. I really don't have to worry about the pin anymore because of Nge2 and I'm pretty much ready to castle. For my opponent things are not looking so good. The fact that his knight and bishop have no places to go that are on b8 and c8 it slows down his development. Also by playing g6 it creates a weakness which you'll see later on during the game on how I took advantage of that move.
555,19,5,b3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/2p1pnp1/3p4/2PP4/1PNBP3/P1Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This move right here indicates that I don't want my opponent to have control over the center. Also I could look into playing Ba3 at some point later on if I really need to play that move. Since g6 was play my dark square bishop belongs on the a1-h8 diagonal 
556,19,6,Na6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3p1p/n1p1pnp1/8/2PP4/2NBP3/P1Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now he wants to get his pieces into the game but of course I want to make it extremely hard for my opponent to get no play at all
557,19,7,1Bb2,b'r2q1rk1/pb3p1p/np2pnp1/2p5/2PP4/P2BP3/1BQ1NPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Finally my development is complete. I got all my pieces where I want them to be. At this point of the game I knew there should be no reason why I can't win this game. The knight on a6 does not belong there at all. Knights belong in the middle of the board. By the time he gets it into action I would've been looking for checkmate
558,19,8,Qc6,b'r4rk1/pb3p1p/npq1pnp1/2p5/2PP4/P1QBP3/1B2NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I was in no fear of this move. In fact I didn't even pay it no attention. I only saw one thing in mind and that was CHECKMATE along the a1-h8 diagonal
559,19,9,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/pb3p1p/np2pBp1/2P5/2P5/P2BPP2/4N1PP/R4RK1 b - -',After taking on f6 I dont ever have to worry about this piece being attack at all
560,19,10,Ba6,b'r4rk1/p4p1p/bp2pBp1/2n5/2P5/P3PP2/2B1N1PP/R4RK1 w - -',When my opponent made this move I started to think for a bit here. After looking and thinking for about 15 minutes or so I saw checkmate in 3 so I really didn't care if he took the pawn.
561,19,11,h5,b'r4rk1/p4p2/1pN1pBp1/2n4p/2b5/P3PP2/2B3PP/R4RK1 w - h6',very good move. My opponent obviously saw checkmate coming when he realize where my knight was going. Now its time to move my rook. By the way ladies and gentlemen I NEVER move the rook on a1 at all. Its all about the this rook I'm about to move next
562,19,12,b5,b'r4rk1/p4p2/2N1pBp1/1pn4p/2b5/P3PP2/2B3PP/R2R2K1 w - -',I instantly saw checkmate again after this move and I was happy. My plan is to move the rook to d4 follow by Rh4....Ne7  and finish it off with Rxh5 mate.
563,19,13,Kh7,b'r4r2/5p1k/2N1pBp1/ppn4p/2b4R/P3PP2/2B3PP/R5K1 w - -',To be honest I wasn't really looking forward to this move. I thought he would attact my knight at least with Rfc8 to by some time in the game. There might not be much play for him but at least checkmate is not that easy anymore. From this move on there's only checkmate in two. Of course after Rxh5 check the pawn can't take because its being pin down to my bishop on c2. But I would like to say that my opponent is a good chess player and hope to play against him again later on.

567,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is an attacking game with an interesting pawn sacrifice at move 18. Black made several mistakes after which he gets mated. 
568,21,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',By transposition an ordinary Scandinavian has become a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. Ordinarily this position arises after the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. e4.
569,21,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move is better than the immediate 3. f3 because then black can try 3. ... e5 and he gets a better position. 
570,21,3,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The normal move here is 3. ... Nf6 after 4. f3 exf3 5. Nxf3 white tries to use his lead in development space advantage and half-open e- and f-lines to create an attack against the black king. 
571,21,4,f3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3Pp3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I still try sacrificing the pawn. 
572,21,5,e3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3P4/2N1pP2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He doesn't accept the pawn. He probably didn't like to be in an opening of which didn't know much so he tries to lead the game in calmer lanes.
573,21,6,Nge2,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I develop my knight with the intention to go to g3 and kick his bishop.
574,21,7,h6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',He anticipates that his will be kicked away and makes a hole at h7. At the same time his pawn controls the g5-square. However I don't think that this was necesarry: The bishop can go to g6 and black doesn't need to excert extra control over g5 since there isn't a knight on f3. A normal developing move like Nc6 or d6 would have been better. 
575,21,8,Ng3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BPN1/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Following my plan of development. I want to continue with Bc4 Qd2 0-0-0 and Rhe1.
576,21,9,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BPN1/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A bad move. Though he starts the development of his other bishop he simply lets his bishop get captured and in doing so gets a double pawn. The retreat of his bishop to h7 would have been better. Furthermore his sixth move seems useless now as he doesn't use the h7-square.
577,21,10,exf5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/5p2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now I have the bishopspair a better pawn structure an extra central pawn and even a bit of a lead in development because he did the move h6.
578,21,11,Bc4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This move is of course a good developing move and there is nothing wrong with it but there was a better and interesting alternative. Possible was the strange looking 9. Qe2. At first sight this move seems to just lock in the bishop on f1 but this move also threatens different things. There's the discovered check over the e-file with which white can win the h6 pawn. Also the queen threatens 10. Qb5  after which both the pawns at b7 and f5 are attacked. 
579,21,12,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',He gets ready to castle but perhaps 10. ... Bd6 was a bit more active.
580,21,13,1Qd3,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I get my queen out of the way so that I can castle long while simultaneously attacking the pawn on f5.
581,21,14,1Qd7,b'rn2k2r/pppqbpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQkq -',He needs a move to defend the pawn and gets a little further behind in development.
582,21,15,1O-O-O,b'rn2k2r/pppqbpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b kq -',Again a normal move following my development plan but again there was a better possibility. With the move 11. d5 I would have stopped his knight at b8 from developing to c6 and also gained space in the center. 
583,21,16,1a6,b'rn2k2r/1ppqbpp1/p4n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w kq -',Another non-developing move. His plan is to play b5 and b4 and start a queenside attack but it's far to early for that. A better move would have been 11. ... 0-0 getting his king a bit safer. 
584,21,17,1h3,b'rn2k2r/1ppqbpp1/p4n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R b kq -',This move wasn't very good of me. The idea behind this move was to start a kingside attack with g4. Because there's a pawn on f5 I would surely be able to open lines on the kingside. However this move is slow and not really necesarry. I could've still done d5 hampering the development of his knight (which now also can't go to a6) or I could've played 12. Rhe1 completing my development scheme. 
585,21,18,1Nc6,b'r3k2r/1ppqbpp1/p1n2n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R w kq -',Now his knight is allowed to develop.

He should've play the normal move 16. ... 0-0 after which chances are about equal. White attacks the kingside and black the queenside.

The ideas behind this move were the following: I get a square for the knight on d5 once he captures on d6 his piece can be attacked from the front and my rook gets an open file. I thought this move would be good since his king is still not safe. The sacrifice wasn't really necesarry though. I could've just played g4 and once his knight moves to d6 I can do Nc3-e2-d4-c6.

You may have spotted Na4 it's not particularly spectacular but did you find the reason for why it was good here?  It seems that Ne2 and Na4 do the same job but retract the move and take a closer look at the position: 
His Queen has to fall now with Rd2 and I must admit I just stopped my analysis there and presumed I had got the advantage full stop but after 20. Na4 Rd2 21. Qxd2 Bxd2 22. Rc5!  The trick is to look at what squares your Knight would control on a4- You will notice c5 and then see how vulnerable my Q and B are to a fork.  Think ""if I could just get my Rook to c5 I would gain a Bishop"".  But there is one obstacle standing in your path: that annoying Bishop on b4 if only it wasn't there then it's happy days!  Therefore you will no longer fear moves such as Rd2 because you know once that Bishop is gone from B4 your plan can come to fruition.  Another reason is that here if Rd2 wasn't possible Ba3 would recover the situation and win back my material Na4 also stops any Ba3 ideas.  So all in all a multi-purpose move which you will trust on yourself to find consistently with this mindset.
Comment from Dmisra (1512):  Na4 is brilliant but still has hurdles for the way I see it- 20. Na4 Rd2 21. Qxd2 Bxd2 22. Rc5. What if black now plays b5!! The white rook takes black bishop on f5 black moves his pawn g6 and the white rook dare not take the knight ( because of.... Bc3) and is somewhat trapped in the middle of the board and gets harried around in a complicated middle game. The rook can escape but the white knight pinned on a4 is lost. Then white has 2 rooks vs a queen and a knight - can white still win??
Comment from me:  Good analysis I didn't spot that 1. But I never claimed the game was won for White after the combination. Black still has play but will remain at a material disadvantage even after your creative line. "

e4 opens lines for both my LSB & Q while taking control of 2 central squares.  On the other hand a small downside is that it's not protected.  
It's important to note for beginners that there is no 1st move which is strictly 'best' (despite Bobby Fisher's ""e4 best by test"" quote) it's all about what style of player you are (It would be ridiculous for someone like Petrosian to play e4 for instance).

I quite like playing against fianchettos for some reason I think it's because it gives me a target to attack or at least the squares around it.  
I knew he would play it looking through his 'Past Games History' and he's played it against me before.  
I had also got pretty much used to his very 'hyper-modern' style of accepting a 'cramped' opening and allowing me total occupation of the centre but then trying to strike out later at the inevitable weaknesses that having a 'big' centre entails with long-range pieces such as Bishops and well timed pawn advances such as c5 d5 e5 and f5 whatever the position requires.  
I however as a mostly 'classical' player was relying on my superior development and piece activity to prove telling.  
I also was also quite sure that he was going to fianchetto both bishops down the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals and try to bring both Knights to e7 and d7 after e6 and d6 which I think is called the Hippo or elephant system something crazy anyway..

Even so with him playing his arguably slow system I knew his Q-side was going to be hard to unravel for castling as was the case in the game.

Also playing his way perhaps his Knights are best on e7 and d7 rather than their so called 'best' squares f6 and c6 because they can better support timely pawn advances into the centre and against pawns on e4 and d4 Knights on f6 and c6 are vulnerable to attack by advances from those pawns as I said.

Bf4 which is not so good IMO.  It also may draw him into playing g5 (which I knew he was too good to make the mistake of doing anyway) but it can also become a target for a later 'tempo' gaining e5 advance from him.

His King is still stuck in the middle and is a few moves away from getting castled and my passed pawn must be stopped.  Which will require attention from his heavy duty pieces opening up opportunities on other areas of the board.  
I had done a lot of dry analysis in preparation for this unfortunately I cannot remember a lot of it.  Although every one of the variations in the reams of analysis I'd done came out with me gaining back all the material and more.  This contribution from cherrypie:
""13....N(e7)g8. Now 14h6 is answered by Bf8. Now black has 3 pieces on h6 so if white moves any piece off black can simply rip it off. There is no check on b5 anymore (see later comment) as the bishop is still on b7. Still not great for black but White has to prove his position is worth the knight sac. After queen moves off the back rank black can castle O-O-O and his king is relatively safe. At some stage may even be able to play Be7 blocking the pin.
I think this is a refutation. Not completely sure but I think so.""
And my response:
""After Bf8 the pawn simply moves onwards to h7!!
It cannot be taken because of the pin and his Knight only has 2 squares to move into and both of them result in a disastrous loss of material for black!!""
Fritz 9 found nothing wrong with the sac either and all in all not a lot black can do now his position is in ruins.
Charleshiggie:
""I tend to agree with you Ian black's position after h7 is a mess. If black does play Qe7 e5 wins another knight. After Be7 which is probably the best move for black white doesn't have to hurry to re-capture the knight the knight on g8 is not going anywhere and where it is stuck there other black pieces are tied up. Yes there is a lot of work to be done but I agree that the position must technically be won for white."""

These seem to me the only reasonable moves in this position as a move like 2.Nc3 in the Vienna hands the initiative to black and loses the ""advantage"" of white being first to move."
935,39,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',No Russian game for him.

937,39,5,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I personally play the Berlin wall 3...Nf6 in order to push white out of their known lines and because I think that black is actually comes out better in the queen-less endgame (I have some bias as I beat my first expert with the Berlin).
938,39,6,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I like to test my opponents on their opening lines in correspondence since it is easy to find mistakes...  So I don't go for the simpler exchange variation (4.Bxc6).

948,39,16,1Bd3,b'2r1r1k1/2qbbppp/p2p1n2/1p1Pp3/1n2P3/1P1BNN1P/P4PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The white bishop is bad here.  Also my position seems a little cramped !? (Even though I have more space in the center...) so I will try to trade pieces to relieve this. 
949,39,17,1a5,b'2r1r1k1/2qbbppp/3p1n2/pp1Pp3/1n2P3/1P1BNN1P/P4PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',He advances his queen side.  So far I have been so distracted with the queen side I can't conduct any of my own plans.  So much for the Spanish torture.

953,39,21,2Nh5,b'2r1r1k1/2qbbp1p/3p2p1/pp1Pp2n/1n2P3/1P2NN1P/PB3PP1/RB1QR1K1 w - -',I wonder if he should have stuck the knight in to that f4 hole instead of where he later puts it?

If I were to open the center my two bishops could come alive as he has some king side weakness (which I can't make use of right now)
955,39,23,2Bc2,b'2r1r1k1/2qbbp1p/n2p2p1/pp1Pp2n/4P3/PP2NN1P/1BB2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Denying penetration on the c-file.  I am going to post the a1 rook behind it.

Maybe it would be more beneficial to double on the c-file.  I think activating the rooks is more important than one knight.  Just a thought. 
963,39,31,2Nc4,b'2r1r1k1/1q1bbpnp/3p2p1/p1nPp3/PpN1P3/1P3N1P/1BBQ1PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Closing down the c-file.  Now the queenside play he had from the early middlegame is non-existent.
964,39,32,2Nfxe5,b'2r1r1k1/q2bbpnp/3p2p1/p1nPN3/PpN1P3/1P5P/1BBQ1PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Here was one of the material imbalances.  I did calculate wrong.  But I was hoping to get control of the a1-h8 diagonal to create mate threats along with a passed d-pawn to give him trouble. 
965,39,33,2Bxe5,b'2r1r1k1/q2bbpnp/6p1/p1nPB3/PpN1P3/1P5P/2BQ1PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Here is the passed d-pawn.

970,39,38,3Nf5,b'2r1rbk1/q2b1p1p/6p1/p1nP1n2/1pNBP3/1P2Q2P/2B2PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',Here again I give up material.  I guess I just wasn't afraid of sacking during this game.  Can you guess what I played?
971,39,39,3exf5,b'2r1rbk1/q2b1p1p/6p1/p1nP1P2/1pNB4/1P2Q2P/2B2PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Not the best move but everything was going the wrong way.  Many times giving up material will help gain the initiative which is better than just letting your opponent slowly kill you (Karpov style).
972,39,40,3Rxe3,b'2r2bk1/q2b1p1p/6p1/p1nP1P2/1pNB4/1P2R2P/2B2PP1/2R3K1 b - -',If 33...gxf5 34.Rg3  Bg7 35. Rxg7  is not good for black.  (same thing with Bxf5)  But all his pieces are inactive.  The queen is in the corner doing nothing.  The rook is on a open/closed file.  Though I am down a Queen for a Rook and a pawn maybe just maybe I am still in the game?  What do you think?  Objectively I am lost but I think there is still hope.
973,39,41,3Qa8,b'q1r2bk1/3b1p1p/6p1/p1nP1P2/1pNB4/1P2R2P/2B2PP1/2R3K1 w - -',Trying to get rid of that pesky passed d-pawn.  But at the cost of an exchange.

edit: And as heinzkat pointed out it just so happens gxh7 is mate also I think he was more worried about the passer...."

980,39,48,Qc3,b'6k1/5p2/6p1/3P4/b3B1P1/1pq1BP1P/8/1R4K1 w - -',That Bishop on e4 that protects the rook is very handy so that I can control the queening square.

983,39,51,4Kg2,b'5k2/5p2/3P2p1/8/b3B1P1/5P1P/1p4K1/1Rq1B3 b - -',Get out of the pin.  If 48...Bc2 49.Bb4 Ke8 50.Bc6  Kf8 51.e7  Kg8 52.e8=Q  or something along those lines.  
984,39,52,4Bb4,b'4k3/5p2/3P2p1/8/bB2B1P1/5P1P/1p4K1/1Rq5 b - -',Still he can't play ...Bc2 because of Bc6 .
985,39,53,5Ba3,b'8/3k1p2/3P2p1/8/b3B1P1/B4P1P/1p4K1/1Rq5 b - -',So he removes the threat of the d-pawn and I take out the b-pawn.  What a trade!
986,39,54,5Qc3,b'8/3k1p2/3P2p1/8/b3B1P1/B1q2P1P/1p4K1/1R6 w - -',"Black tries to set a little trap here.  See if you can find what he was thinking and how I ""escaped"" from it"

988,39,56,5Bc3,b'8/3k1p2/3P2p1/8/4B1P1/2B2P1P/2bq4/1R5K b - -',But this tricky move gets me out of it.
989,39,57,5Rc1,b'8/3k1p2/3P2p1/8/4B1P1/2q2P1P/2b5/2R4K b - -',Now pin the piece.  Black best move here though is 54...Qh8 because then 55.Rxc2 Qxh3  56.Kg1 Qg3  57.Kf1 Kxd6 when black still has winning chances if his king can get in.
990,39,58,Ke5,b'8/5p2/6p1/4k3/4B1P1/5P1P/2R3K1/4q3 w - -',"Now he offered me a draw which I gladly accepted.  I wonder though if maybe his king could get in?  What do you think?

Thanks for looking I hope you enjoyed the game."
