For those who may not be familiar with it it is characterised by 2 pawn chains on both sides of the board as can be seen in the diagrammed position. Needless to say every strong player needs to know the typical plans for white and black in this type of position as Carlsbad structure can arise from many openings (including Queen’s gambit declined Nimzo-indian defence Gruenfeld defence etc. Torre system and Caro-Kann with colors reversed etc.) Those plans often stretch well into the middlegame and sometimes as deep as the endgame. Carlsen enjoys slow kinds of positions that usually arise in this structure while Topalov is not a big fan of them and I doubt that he has had much experience with them as he usually seeks to play more dynamic positions.

In a nutshell white’s a and b pawns attack three black pawns on the queenside (thus the name “minority” attack) aiming to create pawn weaknesses that white would later like to exploit with his pieces.

Sadly such an interesting struggle had to finish this way.


Leaving the unfortunate fate of this game aside does white have a win after  60…Kf7 ? He does indeed but working it out at the board is quite a difficult task regardless of what many “couch-experts” (with Houdini or Stockfish running on their computer) might say. The right move is 61.Bc4+! (The attempt to attack from the kingside with 61.Bh5+ Ke6 62.Qg8+ Kd7 63.Qc8+ Ke7 64.Qe8+ Kf6 65.Qf8+ fails to bring a full point as the king escapes to the center (An interesting attempt to create a checkmating net with the help of white king is 65.Qc6+ Ke7 66.Kg4!?

The key check and the one that might be the toughest one to find in the calculation of a long line. The point is that black king can not step onto e5 due to Qxb8 with check so it has to stay in the corner. 65…Kf7 (65…Ke6 66.Bc4+ Kf5 (66…Ke5 67.Qxb8+) 67.g4+! is even simpler.) 66.Bc4+ Kg6 67.Qe8+ Kf6 68.Qf8+! using the same idea to keep the king away from e5! 68…Kg5 69.Qg7+ Kf5 70.g4+! This move is essential otherwise white can not win!  (70.Bd3+ Ke6 leads nowhere.) 70…Ke4 71.Qg6+! Another key queen check preventing king’s run toward the center 71…Kf3 (as 71…Kd4 72.Qb6+ wins the queen!) and now white wins with a study-like queen manoeuvre: 72.Qc6+ Ke3 73.Qc5+ Kf3 74.Qd5+ Ke3 75.Qd3#!  


A beautiful winning combination and a beautiful final position too bad we could not see it happen at the board!"

But do you remember my most recent game against archduke_piccolo that I annotated a couple of days ago.  One of the main lessons was to deviate from the guidelines.  In this particular position I'd say that Jack should've done that which is why I view this move as an inaccuracy.  Instead best was 3...Ne7  Even though the N is a big crammed it prevents doubled pawns.  Now normally I wouldn't go into as much details because as someone but I forgot who said it wasn't that big of a deal.  However continuing the course with GM Susan Polgar basic strategy and planning was discussed.  One of the things she outlined was healthier pawn structure.  By playing this I get a small edge because I take and when Jack takes back he winds up with doubled pawns which I don't have.  Therefore I applied something that I learned from that course for this game.  Had he retreated the N back to e7 this would not happen and it would still be even.

However Mr. Stockel was surprised that I did not take and said that I could've won a pawn had I played 5.Nxe5.  So I looked it over and realize that this would not have happened because if 5.Nxe5 5...Nxe5 and this is an exchange which I don't like as well.  Although common I had a bad exerience with that which I won't forget.
72,2,3,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now worried about the e pawn he adds a defender.  However this wasn't needed because as noted I wouldn't have gotten a free pawn regardless.

The idea behind exchange early and often is to receive points and get a draw against stronger players.  But my idea isn't really about points but rather learning and improving from that.  So exchanges are not always what one should keep in mind.  But this game happened last Friday.  Therefore I told Jack which I based on his advice for games against Tom that I like to exchange early and often.  So he said ""You like early exchanges?  If you like early exchanges why not?"""
76,2,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I had two choices of how to take.  But even though guidelines don't apply I do not enjoy bringing my Q out prematurely because of what happened against him a while ago.  In that game I was completely development so once that happened I brought my Q out.  However he said then that the costly blunder was still bringing the Q out too soon and that one should wait until you absolutely must bring the Q into play.  With that being said I took with the N.

On a normal basis I would take on f6 because first back in the day I always thought that N was worth more then a B since it's not an endgame.  But then after a studying another helpful article by GM Dan Heisman which cplusplus11 I realized that this isn't so.  And with black's structure and placement combined to where the DSB and what danger it poses the B is more dangerous then the N.  Second why exchange when I can get a pawn.  Note: It is free since the Q is attacked.
80,2,11,1Nxe7+,b'r1b2rk1/p1pqNppp/5n2/3p2B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now that I'm up a pawn the idea is liquidation because it's good to exchange pieces when ahead.  However we are also coming to the point where I sort of forgot what was played.
81,2,12,Qxe4,b'r1b2rk1/p1p2ppp/5n2/3N2B1/4q3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',At this point he did what you typically see with a GM.  Particularly Judit Polgar and a certain player who I won't mention.  But this is where Jack teaches like a GM as those quizzes are in fact HW.  In addition he provides variations which you often see with archduke_piccolo and grandmasters.  This is also in part where Jack's teaching style is similar to ION's teaching style and how it all blends in with my style of learning.  So the question is how can white win a piece in this position?  Now this wasn't played but rather it was 12...Qg6 to prevent the win of material in the game.  Although not possible in this position that's how it was really played which is why I don't remember exactly what was played.  Worth noting that in part my writing was a bit sloppy because the game started after 11:20 am so I did not have much more then 30 minutes to play this.  Therefore I was in a rush to record because of what was mentioned in the jkarp campaign.
82,2,13,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/p1p2ppp/5n2/3N4/4q3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Solution: 13.Bxf6  And if 13...gxf6?? 14.Nxf6 forking the Q and K.  Not only does this win the Q but blacks K would be very exposed as well.  Of course Jack was not going to allow that.
83,2,14,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/p1p2ppp/5n2/3N4/4q3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? So he puts pressure right on the center which is generally a good idea as that's one way to control it.  But in this position it is a blunder because of my next move.

It looks so when the Q and B appear to be forked but the Q was en-prise due to the B so 15.f3?? would've lost a Q for B.  My focus was if worse came to worse exchanging but really to grab the R.  And after I played this Jack asked ""What are you attacking""?  I told him the Q's and R. "
87,2,18,1Be6,b'r3r1k1/p1N2ppp/4bn2/3Q4/4q3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He said that this was his only move.  I know why as considered and almost played 15...Re5 but after which I liquidate Q's and keep the advantage since I'm ahead.  The idea was also what I learned from Susan of improving your position and exchanging would do that.  But Jack does not allow this because of what he said and played.

89,2,20,1Bh3,b'r3r1k1/p1N2ppp/5n2/8/4q3/4B2b/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"Now Jack gave me quiz by playing this.  In it he asked ""What must you do?"" which is the same question to the previous quiz I showed at KOH chess club with taking a quiz.  Now while in this position you could take in the actual game taking was not an option because the g pawn was directly.  The Q was on I believe Qg6 when we played.  Initially I played I played 17.Qd5 going for an exchange.  But I overlooked the N and he said ""See if you can find a better.  Don't lose a R.""  As it turns out I would've lost my Q if I'd played this because of his N.  This time I could not find the solution because somehow the Q was moved to d1 but the Q as he pointed out was originally on d2.  With that being said the solution was 17.g3  In this position it actually mates so I recorded something similar of 17.f3 which in the actual game it would've mated.  Then Jack accurately said ""And that still leaves the R's attacked."""

93,2,24,1Rae1,b'4r1k1/p4ppp/5n2/8/4q3/4BP1b/PPPQ2PP/4RRK1 b - -',Now in the actual game it wasn't possible to take the Q for the reasons noted earlier.  My goal was to put pressure on the center.  Plus the R is right behind the Q which is known to strengthen your position.  I think that better however was 19.Rad1 which also puts pressure.  I know because I studied GM games.  It included one from Judit Polgar against Anand which she won as well as several from GAC and both put their Q's right in front of a R or R behind the Q.  Those two added extra pressure and by doing so they got an advantage which eventually became overwhelming.  The only reason I didn't do this is because Jack has said that it's a bad idea to place both your R's on the same color because a B on that color can in general fork both R's.  And he gave an example.  But that does not apply here because of the f pawn.  After this I don't remember what was played afterwards as I experimented with a messed up position that was totally different then what happened in our game.  So I had to stop right here.  In the end however it does not matter because the game does not last much longer.  To be exact the game lasted for 24 moves which is only 5 more from where I stopped.  After that it timed out so there was no time to finish the game at all.  Therefore it was recorded as unfinished and what that also means is that it was in progress when we ended since I had to leave at that point and Jack was really focusing on a different game and would stay there until finished with Bert against Tom and how Bert won.  So between that and I having to leave after the 24th move we called it a day.

139,4,27,1Rg3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pBp/2n5/8/Q1P5/3B1qR1/PP3n1P/2KR4 b kq -',Again interesting. I am +4 with a R hanging. I hoped for Qc2 releasing pressure and giving me a little breath for Rg8. This move stops a lot of bad lines for white...

145,4,33,1Bg7,b'r7/ppp1kpBp/2n1b3/8/Q1P2q2/3RR3/PP5P/2K5 b - -',? Just a tempo for me! Bc3 would have been the best safe place. but black may want to go Rb3 pressing on b7 and Bc3 would be in the way. GK's engine suggests Qa3+ at once and it is very strong indeed.

150,4,38,2Qxh2+,b'8/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P5/2BRR3/PPK4q/6r1 w - -',? Not the best. Qf2+ restricted more white's defences. Rd2 is impossible due to QxRe3. 
151,4,39,2Kb3,b'8/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P5/1KBRR3/PP5q/6r1 b - -',Self-pinning his c pawn... but putting the K on a safe place. I couldn't believe that I could not get something from this and now Rg2 is not so threatening as if my Q would have been on f2. Anyway white has already tactic mate: Qa3+ Ke8 Bf6!

155,4,43,2Bf6,b'4k3/1pp2p1p/p1n1bB2/8/2P5/QK1RR3/PP5q/6r1 b - -',!! Sigh this sets tactical mate in few. Rxd8+ forces NxR which opens the way for Qe7#. I can sac my Q on d6 to go on some more moves but it would have been childish. My opponent played very well with less weak moves than me without falling in traps as a proper serious chess player should do. Very well played by him!

298,9,44,3c5,b'8/p6p/3k1p2/2p5/2P2p2/1KP5/P3rPPP/5R2 w - -',and so i try to lock the position up a bit and force his king to the A file if he wants to come down

The first 2 moves were already decided before the game started since it presumably shows the strengths and weaknesses of a player rather well. However I highly doubted that this was going to end well for me. I who usually prides himself on having a high theoretical knowledge about openings have 0 knowledge when it comes to 1.e4 e5. and thus if peta forces a theoretical variation of something I'd probably lose. Or if he plays some dubious line that doesn't work given that white plays exactly 3 or 4 correct moves then I already know I won't find those 3/4 moves and lose as a result. You can say in a way that he went easy on me. The last time I played 1. e4 in a serious match was about 7 years ago when I was 12. I think that says enough about my inexperience with the opening. I tried different things back then and after my first win with 1.d4 I never bothered to play anything else. It'll be an unfamiliar but interesting experience to say the least.
384,11,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Of the many openings i could have chosen for I chose the Italian opening. The reason is simple. Every other opening I know of has too much theory behind it. For example: In the Ruy Lopez there's sidelines of sidelines of sidelines. Some superGM's probably even analysed this opening all the way up to move 30. Getting caught up in such an opening when I have no knowledge about it isn't advisable. The Italian does have some tricks behind it in terms of d4 pushes and Ng5 moves but for the most part it's supposedly pretty straightforward.

I think that would mean we'd be playing the fried liver attack an opening which I'm not too fond of. I didn't bother to read too much about it but I imagine it'd be met with 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nc3 h6. or something of the sorts. An alternate solution and what I believe is the main variation is 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 which is just asking for trouble. That opening is so completely different from how I usually play I didn't dare go into it. I think in some theoretical lines black could even allow Nxf7 giving up the rook since white wastes a lot of time capturing.

Well at most it's a slight error not something game losing. It creates a double pawn but I don't think it's really a troubling pawn for black. It'll make ideas of d5 a lot easier in the future to break open the position. Black will probably castle king side next to use the open file. According to Bigpeta Bb3 was the heavy favorite according to gameknot databases. I looked at these databases before opting for Bxe6 but found that while Bb3 wins 3% more games i consider 3% not relevant enough to take Bxe6 out of consideration. The problem with Bb3 is that the threat doesn't disappear in the end an exchange will take place as I find it pretty inevitable. I also don't have much experience with bishops on this particular square which also influenced my decision.

Qe7 was played with the idea of maybe playing either d5 and create a diagonal for the queen to attack on. Most likely this'll be done after I castle. Castling king side doesn't really look very safe anymore so that's no longer a candidate move for the time being. Maybe it's time to fix the double pawn with the likes of d4 but black isn't obligated to take it and probably won't. It's something I should keep in mind for the future though. I don't dislike the plan of Qe2 with the same idea that I figure black is following.

O-O although interesting since it gives the possibility of a queen side pawn storm felt like putting my king into too much danger. A move like Nh5 targeting the g3 square was something I was very concerned about. O-O-O is very similar but grants more king safety at the cost of less attacking possibilities. That being said I calculate the following sequence. 11. O-O-O d5 12.exd5 exd5 13. Rad1 Rhf8. In that variation the only big difference is that black has more space and thus more likely will be the aggressor. Something I'd rather not allow. Therefore I played d4 with which I try to gain space before black has the opportunity to do so. Black has a variety of ways to deal with this issue. I calculated 11. d4 Rhf8 12. O-O-O d5. Another possibility on move 12 is exd4 but it leaves black slightly more cramped. d5 is a response in which white has to capture rather carefully. Capturing in a wrong move order might leave him a pawn down.

If dxe5 then follows Nxe4 Nxe4 dxe4 and the isolated e-pawns are too difficult to defend. exd might cause me to get an isolated e-pawn but I'm pretty sure it's not that easy for black to take advantage of. I can probably find the time to castle somewhere along the way.
403,11,20,Nxe5,b'2kr3r/ppp1q1pp/8/3pn3/8/4PN1P/PPP1Q1P1/R3K2R w KQ -',14 moves and you can almost say we're in an endgame. Not the typical stuff you'd see in a d4 opening. That being said I asses the position to be better for black but not in such a manner that I'm going to sit in a corner and cry about it. 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15.O-O-O is what I guessed would happen during these moves at first as it seems most logical. A possible continuation could be for example 15. Nc4 ( preparing for moves such as Qb4 ) 16. e4 dxe4 ( pushing loses material if ignored I could play Rh1e1 and with that prepare to take ). 17. Qxc4 exf3 18. Qg4+ 19.Qd7 Qxf3. Of course the variation alters slightly depending on how black plays but I don't see any issues here.
404,11,21,1Nxe5,b'2kr3r/ppp1q1pp/8/3pN3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/R3K2R b KQ -',Although I a first planned on O-O-O this accelerates things into an endgame. I calculate the following sequence: 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 16. O-O-O with a very even position. The position is slightly better for black but it seems very drawish. I can't see of any good way for either side to really gain an edge here. g2 is slightly weaker than g7 and black has slightly more space in the center but that's the only issues that white is facing.
405,11,22,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp3pp/8/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/2KR3R b - -',The predicted sequence of moves. The score is probably -0.30 according to computers considering how they value space advantage ( I haven't actually checked this it's an estimate ). I think an eventual pawn push to d4 is something I have to be wary of but not at the moment because I do still have a check with Qg4 which would also target the d4 square thus not losing any material. I'm not sure if black has enough time to move his king out of the way and then play d4.
406,11,23,1Rhe8,b'2krr3/ppp3pp/8/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/2KR3R w - -',Aiming for the e3 pawn. A simple but effective plan which makes d4 a possibility in the future. Let's say white makes a hypothetical Rh1f1 move. Then a possible sequence could be 17. Rh1f1 d4 18. Qg4+ Kb8 19. Rxd4 Qxe3+. Material will still be even but I'd be lying if I said that the queen on e3 wouldn't be annoying. Of course there are other variations there but you catch the drift. It's about time for white to think this trough. What type of endgame do I want to reach and how do I reach it. What type of endgame gives me the best chances for a positive result?
407,11,24,1Rhf1,b'2krr3/ppp3pp/8/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/2KR1R2 b - -', made this move hypothetically in my mind last move and found out that it didn't really work. I left my ongoing games for a few days to go do some other stuff came back stared at this board and suddenly realised that the only idea why my idea didn't really work that well was because i assumed Qg4+ is into this somehow. However it hit me that this might not be the case. This is something which is said on a regular basis to me I usually find the right move in a position and then write it off as a possibility for an inferior alternative. Rh1f1 is played under the assumption that defending e3 in the near future will prove too difficult. Therefore I'm willing to let it go if I get the right sort of compensation or can regain the pawn somehow. I calculate: 17. Rh1f1 Qxe3 18. Qxe3 Rxe3 19.Rf7 after which black can't defend both the d5 and g7 pawn so one will most definitely fall. Black doesn't have to take on e3 however I do think it's arguably the move that keeps the most pressure on the position.
408,11,25,1Rd7,b'2k1r3/pppr2pp/8/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/2KR1R2 w - -',I report my thinking behind every move to bigpeta as it helps him understand my thought process which leads to more efficient teaching. He agreed on my idea that after 17. Rh1f1 Qxe3 18. Qxe3 Rxe3 19. Rf7 the position is equal. He plays Rd7 to undermine this idea. I hadn't actually considered this move but it seems strong. Maybe even slightly stronger then my anticipated response. At this point I'm not sure what my reply is going to be especially since endgames are my Achilles heel so to speak. I notice that his rook and king are nicely lined up so ideas of Qg4 pop up but that forfeits the pawn on e3. I'm not sure I want to defend e3 with a rook though since it feels like black would just simply line up his pieces and eventually go for it.
409,11,26,1Kb1,b'2k1r3/pppr2pp/8/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/1K1R1R2 b - -',I find this move. It doesn't do much except get my king out of the c1-h5 diagonal which could complicate things. This looks like it loses a pawn but it actually doesn't after 18. Kb1 Qxe3 19. Qxe3 Rxe3 20. Rf8+ Rd8 21. Rxd8 Kxd8 22. Rxd5 regaining the pawn. Black's king will be more centralized/active and the g2 pawn is a reason for slight concern but I think white can probably draw this given correct play. That being said I had the bad premonition that bigpeta wouldn't go for that variation. He's sure to analyze the most out of my weaker endgame skills that much I'm sure of.
410,11,27,1b6,b'2k1r3/p1pr2pp/1p6/3pq3/8/4P2P/PPP1Q1P1/1K1R1R2 w - -',As GM Ben Finegold would say in some of his youtube videos: Make Luft not war. This move does exactly that it creates a flight square for the king and prepares c5 and a5 ideas. There's little White can do to prevent it.
411,11,28,1Rd3,b'2k1r3/p1pr2pp/1p6/3pq3/8/3RP2P/PPP1Q1P1/1K3R2 b - -',This move defends e3. I'm pretty sure there must be some better more challenging move out there but I can't find it. I guess the plan for white and black here is to move the pawns on the queenside of the board. The anticipated response is c5.
412,11,29,1Kb7,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p6/3pq3/8/3RP2P/PPP1Q1P1/1K3R2 w - -',Moving his king out of the diagonal making it slightly more active by giving it the possibility to move to c6 and possibly preparing c5. 
413,11,30,2Qd2,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p6/3pq3/8/3RP2P/PPPQ2P1/1K3R2 b - -',I can't just turtle up all game this puts the pawn on d5 under pressure while still keeping 2 defenders on my e3 pawn.
414,11,31,2Qe6,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p2q3/3p4/8/3RP2P/PPPQ2P1/1K3R2 w - -',Protecting the rook in case of e4 or c4 ideas I suppose.
415,11,32,2c4,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p2q3/3p4/2P5/3RP2P/PP1Q2P1/1K3R2 b - c3',I think c4 is needed to get some progress here. dxc4 obviously loses material. Putting the queen on the b1-h7 diagonal is something i can just move out of. and pushing probably gets met by exd4 Qxc4. After which white may have an isolated pawn but it's very difficult to take advantage of since there are no pawn majorities on either side. c6 is also a possible move which is what I'm anticipating to be played by peta. I think I'll just capture on d4 if that move were to be played.
416,11,33,2d4,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p2q3/8/2Pp4/3RP2P/PP1Q2P1/1K3R2 w - -',Probably the best response for reasons which I already stated in the previous move.
417,11,34,2Rxd4,b'4r3/pkpr2pp/1p2q3/8/2PR4/4P2P/PP1Q2P1/1K3R2 b - -',I didn't consider this at first as I was only looking at exd4 Qxc4 but it hit me that there might be something better for white here. Black can't play something like 22. ... Qxe3 because it gets met by 23. Qxe3 Rxe3 24. Rxd7. The variation which I anticipated is 22. Rxd4 Rxd4 23. Qxd4 Qxe3 ( winning back the pawn ) 24. Qxe3 Rxe3. After that Black's rook is more active but after for example 25. Rf2 it doesn't look bad for white. A b3 move can follow to defend c4 if he were to aim for it.
418,11,35,2Qxd4,b'4r3/pkp3pp/1p2q3/8/2PQ4/4P2P/PP4P1/1K3R2 b - -',Better was exd4 because of Qg6 which I missed. I hate to admit it but my calculation skills go downhill as there are less and less pieces on the board. It comes from my lack of endgame studies. It's why I usually try and end a game before it reaches the endgame.
419,11,36,2Qg6+,b'4r3/pkp3pp/1p4q1/8/2PQ4/4P2P/PP4P1/1K3R2 w - -',I missed this variation. I actually looked at this but didn't notice that the g2 pawn is hanging. Kc1 Qxg2 equalizes the pawns but what does white play after that to defend both the e3 and the h3 pawn? It looks like I may have messed up. There's still Rf7 after Qg2 which gives some play but I'm pretty sure White's going to play with a pawn down the rest of the game. Luckily 1 pawn can still lead to a draw in this day and age granted that the correct circumstances are met. 
420,11,37,2Kc1,b'4r3/pkp3pp/1p4q1/8/2PQ4/4P2P/PP4P1/2K2R2 b - -',Better then Ka1 in my opinion. After Qxg2 my rook is targeted and I'd like to move it to f7. If my king is on a1 then that's impossible because of Qh1+ which leads to a forced checkmate in 2 after 25. ... Qh1+ 26. Rf1 Qxf1 . 27. Qd1 Qxd1++
421,11,38,2Rf7,b'4r3/pkp2Rpp/1p6/8/2PQ4/4P2P/PP4q1/2K5 b - -',If the pawn on h3 is to fall then I can temporarily equalise the material. Checks along the lines of Qd5+ can also quickly escalate if he were to play carelessly.
422,11,39,2Rxg7,b'4r3/pkp3Rp/1p6/8/2PQ4/4P2q/PP6/2K5 b - -',Capturing material. He can win the pawn on e3 however doing so isn't easy. Rxe3 gets met with Qd5+. After that black can only go to the 8th rank after which I can play Rg8+ In the best case it's checkmate in the worst case he loses his queen for my rook. If the pawn on e3 falls because of Qxe3+ then after trading queens i can capture on h3 to equalize material. He can put my king in check a few times but it can easily escape and defend my 3 pawns leading to a more or less equal endgame again. Because of the variations I just mentioned capturing the pawn on e3 currently isn't very appealing. That being said Black's position is still favorable.
423,11,40,2h5,b'4r3/pkp3R1/1p6/7p/2PQ4/4P2q/PP6/2K5 w - h6',The best move for as far as I can see it. Not only does it push his pawn 2 steps closer to promotion but now I also have to watch out for Qxe3 winning a pawn. Since the following would be forced: 27. Qxe3 Qxe3 28.Rxe3 after which he's a clear pawn ahead. Rxe3 is still not an option because of 27.Qd5+ 28. Kb8 Rg8. I'm not quite sure what to play here as Qxe3 should follow no matter what white plays here. I considered 27. Qd5+ Kb8 28. Rg8 pinning his rook. In the case of Rxg8 I could play Qxg8 in the hope to draw by repetition but I realised that a6 is also a flight square for black which isn't a place my queen could reach. A draw by repetition would be impossible.
424,11,41,2Rh7,b'4r3/pkp4R/1p6/7p/2PQ4/4P2q/PP6/2K5 b - -',The pawn on e3 is lost however with Rh7 i prepare to equalise material once more.
425,11,42,2Qg3,b'4r3/pkp4R/1p6/7p/2PQ4/4P1q1/PP6/2K5 w - -',Preparing Qe1+.
426,11,43,2Rxh5,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2PQ4/4P1q1/PP6/2K5 b - -',Winning back the material I'll eventually end up losing. This is where the complications start though and as such this is a bad move. White could have delayed this.
427,11,44,2Qe1+,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2PQ4/4P3/PP6/2K1q3 w - -',Kc2 leads to Qe2+ winning the rook. Therefore my only option is Qd1. Maybe getting my rook on that diagonal was his intention all along and why he didn't mind me taking it.
428,11,45,Qxe3+,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2P5/4q3/PP6/2KQ4 w - -',Defending with Qd2 means he'll play Qg1+ with the aim of getting to the g6 square and maybe fork king and rook. That of course implies that I'm going to be playing Kc2 but it's not that simple. 30. Qd2 Qg1+ 31.Qd1 Re1! winning my queen for his rook. I start calculating whether or not I can move my king to maybe get out of the nasty future skewer and or pin.
429,11,46,3Kb1,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2P5/4q3/PP6/1K1Q4 b - -',I didn't like what I found white loses the c4 pawn no matter what. There's still quite a few pieces on the board though a draw is definitely still possible. The only thing I need to do is somehow trade all of the pieces so he only has 1 pawn left. If my king in that case is at the correct square it's a theoretical drawn endgame. I barely ever study endgames but the one I've spent most time on is king and pawn versus king and how to draw that.
430,11,47,3Qe4+,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2P1q3/8/PP6/1K1Q4 w - -',Winning the c4 pawn.
431,11,48,Qxc4,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2q5/8/PP6/K2Q4 w - -',He's a clear pawn up. White can still draw given correct play and that's what I decide to be aiming for. If I'm too ambitious and try and force something it'll weaken my kingside and I'll probably get the short end of the stick. Remember several moves ago when I said I can't turtle up all game? Well time to become a tortoise instead then.
432,11,49,3a3,b'4r3/pkp5/1p6/7R/2q5/P7/1P6/K2Q4 b - -',Creating a flightsquare for the future. Currently it's not of much use with his queen on c4 but unless he somehow gets his rook on the first rank it won't be much of a problem. This move was actually on recommendation by peta I didn't come up with it myself though it makes a lot of sense when I thought about it afterwards. I hadn't thought much about the position yet at that point as I was resolving real life stuff. I may or may not have found this move if I had thought about it before peta recommended it. Nobody will ever know.
433,11,50,3a5,b'4r3/1kp5/1p6/p6R/2q5/P7/1P6/K2Q4 w - a6',Preparing moves such as b5 c5 etc. Pretty straightforward moves to try and crash through my pawnstructure and maybe somewhere get a winning position. I think this game can given proper play still go to a draw but it's easy to slip up. I'll have to play very accurately.
434,11,51,3Rh1,b'4r3/1kp5/1p6/p7/2q5/P7/1P6/K2Q3R b - -',Not neccecarily but probably only the 3th best move. Best was either Qd5+ which I missed but saw a move afterwards which forces the trade of queens. After that black is still a pawn up but his ability to catch me offguard somewhere and force a win is a lot less. The second best move was noticed by peta a move later. Qh1+ giving check to the Black king. Problem was that I couldn't see a good follow-up after Kb8. Maybe Rh7 after that pressuring c7 and preventing the king of going where he wants to. Qd5 is better if you're playing for a draw Qh1 is better if you're somehow still playing for a win with white which is ambitious but I guess somehow still possible. The idea behind Rh1 was to defend any Rf8 -> Rf1 ideas. After Rh1 I'd be able to move my queen around freely without having to fear pins or backrank checkmates.
435,11,52,3Re2,b'8/1kp5/1p6/p7/2q5/P7/1P2r3/K2Q3R w - -',Pressuring b2. It's not too much of a threat but white has to be careful at all times.
436,11,53,3Re1,b'8/1kp5/1p6/p7/2q5/P7/1P2r3/K2QR3 b - -',Offering the trade. if he trades then a draw becomes significantly easier if he doesn't then at least my rook is slightly better. I anticipated Rf2 here keeping the pressure on b2 and preventing Rf1 or Re2 ideas. Maybe he can also play Rc2 but I think that's drawish if I play a waitinf move like Rg1.
437,11,54,3Rf2,b'8/1kp5/1p6/p7/2q5/P7/1P3r2/K2QR3 w - -',Staying on the 2nd rank. Notice that Rf1 or Re2 aren't possible anymore because of his queen so I can't force a draw or trade from this position.
438,11,55,3Rh1,b'8/1kp5/1p6/p7/2q5/P7/1P3r2/K2Q3R b - -',Moving further away from Black's pieces. There's little White can do to improve his position all he can do is move his pieces around protect a few key squares and put up a tight guard. This is also probably where I start to nag in chat ( as I'm a bit of a sore loser ) about not being able to improve my position.
439,11,56,Ka6,b'8/2p5/kp6/8/p1q5/P7/1P3r2/K2QR3 w - -',Moving out of possible checks. Black has all the time in the world so he might as well.

442,11,59,Qb3,b'8/k1p5/1p6/8/p7/Pq2Q3/1P5r/K3R3 w - -',Offering a trade of pieces. Normally this would be a good thing but I'm not so sure if I want a pawn on b3 Note that I also can't capture the pawn on b3 if it gets there with Re3 because of Rh1+ Re1 Rxe1 checkmate. Having a pawn on b3 means permanently sealing of all escape squares. The only way to escape would be to move my king all the way around which arguably costs too much time. Meanwhile black is going to march all his pawns down the board and when c3 is played and I take bxc3 it creates a passed b-pawn for Black
443,11,60,4Qd4,b'8/k1p5/1p6/8/p2Q4/Pq6/1P5r/K3R3 b - -',Declining the trade and watching over b2 as there's a checkmate threat there.
444,11,61,Rd2,b'8/k1p5/1p6/8/p2Q4/P7/1Pqr4/K5R1 w - -',Neither side can do a lot but glare at each other and make empty threats. Let's play a hypothetical Qe5 followed by peta wanting to advance the c-pawn. 44. Qe5 c5 45. Qc7+ Ka6 46. Qc8 Ka7. would occur which is a draw by repetition. If you go to a5 I give a check on a8. if Black goes to b5 I go to e8. Black can escape with his king but I'll be putting checks everywhere until he finally lines up his pieces with his king after which I give check and trade them of. Advancing the b-pawn has the same problem in that it makes your king more vulnerable to checks and it doesn't actually do anything. On top of all that you need to watch out for Black's a-pawn not falling somewhere along the line.As long as I don't place my pieces on a square where Black can trade positively and I keep the b2 pawn under protection Black can't progress. It is under the assumption that I won't blunder that a draw is offered. It was a pretty enjoyable game ( and frustrating at times ) but I'm pretty sure peta would wipe the floor with me were he to play his usual opening. My long term planning in a game definitely still needs work  as well as my endgame skills. In this game I took several days per move in the endgame which I of course wouldn't get in an over the board game. I've been slowly improving myself in the areas I still lack in but it'll still be a long road from here as this game confirmed the fact that I'm still lacking.

Although it was a day or so before that lesson in KOH club I still thought that a N was worth more then a B.  But that was not the reason behind this move however.  If I wanted I didn't have to take.  However there are two reasons I played this.  First as Jack told me in my game against Tom since that opponent doesn't like to exchange when you're up against a much stronger opponent it's better to exchange early and often if things are even.  Second the idea was to double up his pawns because later on it is known that doubling your pawns will more often then not allow your opponent to get a passed pawn because two pawns are one file.  Therefore the opponent can get a pawn on a file without any pawns in front or to the side of it.

As much as I didn't want to and have been told that it's generally not a good idea to do this if your opponent could take back with the Q 8.Bxf6 was essential one way or another.

However what I said in superandy's annotation was a mistake which was similar as that would've lost a piece due to the B being locked.  Well I just made the same error.  At best white winds up the equivalent to a pawn down.

Worth noting that this was only about an hour prior to the link that cplusplus11 showed in KOH club of which is worth more as I wrongly thought that a N was worth more then a B.  I knew that he'd take my B and afterwards I'd take with the N leaving that piece standing.  However a B is worth more in this particular position.  The idea being that after 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 pins the N.  And it happens to be a nasty pin.

716,23,22,1Nxh8,b'r6N/pp2k1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/1q2Pn2/8/P1PQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Well now Qxe4+ gives black a strong position!
717,23,23,1Qxd2+,b'r6N/pp2k1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/4Pn2/8/P1Pq1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',I would say it is not the best but anyway black won...
718,23,24,Rxh8,b'7r/pp2k1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/4Pn2/8/P1PK1PPP/R4B1R w - -',I feared black would have gone for Rd8+ at once with strong possibilities of a mate net. 
719,23,25,1g3,b'7r/pp2k1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/4Pn2/6P1/P1PK1P1P/R4B1R b - -',...to be followed by f3!

722,23,28,2f3,b'3r4/pp2k1pp/2n1bn2/2P1p3/4P3/2K2PP1/P1P1B2P/R6R b - -',Trying to build a fortress. 
723,23,29,2Nd7,b'3r4/pp1nk1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/4P3/2K2PP1/P1P1B2P/R6R w - -',Now black's Ns are much stronger. 
724,23,30,2Bc4,b'3r4/pp1nk1pp/2n1b3/2P1p3/2B1P3/2K2PP1/P1P4P/R6R b - -',? Again a R move was indicated: Rb1 or Rd1.

726,23,32,Rd2,b'8/pp2k1pp/2n5/4p3/n1K1P3/5PP1/P1Pr3P/R4R2 w - -',c2 is not attacked since after Rxc2+ Kb3 seems to win a N. 
727,23,33,2h4,b'8/pp2k1pp/2n5/4p3/n1K1P2P/5PP1/P1Pr4/R4R2 b - h3',So I defend the other pawn.

729,23,35,2Kd5,b'8/pp2k1pp/8/3Kp3/n2nP2P/5PP1/P1Pr4/R4R2 b - -',Almost any move gets black the possibility of a check forking my K and a R. 
730,23,36,2Kf6,b'8/pp4pp/5k2/3Kp3/n2nP2P/5PP1/P1Pr4/R4R2 w - -',...and the position is hopeless since one of my R will fall to a fork soon no matter what I do. 
731,23,37,2Rad1,b'8/pp4pp/5k2/3Kp3/n2nP2P/5PP1/P1Pr4/3R1R2 b - -',?? ... but other moves just delayed the same result. Sigh!
732,23,38,2Nc3+,b'8/pp4pp/5k2/3Kp3/3nP2P/2n2PP1/P1Pr4/3R1R2 w - -',
733,24,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I was positively surprised to see the Scandinavian defence because it is a line that I play as well and few others seem to use it certainly not the 2.... Nf6 line which is played in this game.
734,24,1,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',3.d4 we enter the modern variation I don't know much of the Scandinavian lines as white I only know what I dislike to play against. And most commonly it's the main line of the theory.
735,24,2,Qxd5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And I think we switched to the Qxd5 variation here with Qxd5 and Nf6 swapped. Still ok but I like to push a queen around while developing.
736,24,3,c4,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',And so I start pushing. I prefer c4 over Nc3 as it gives me more space and even prepares a move like d5 dominating the center. I don't really mind a move like Qe4+ as I can put my DSB in between (I'd rather not move my knight to e2 as it belongs on f3 and Be2 gets struck down by Qxg2 and the loss of a rook)
737,24,4,e5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2PPq3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq e6',An attack on my center well it had to come sooner or later. e5 also allows Bb4+ which could get annoying since my DSB is pinned. Most people say that after Bb4+ you can play Nc3 since Bxc3 bxc3 is ok for white with a solid center and the bisschop pair but I still ain't convinced.
738,24,5,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2PPq3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Lets just continue kicking the queen. However this bumps into the pin of Bb4 and thus isn't much better than blocking of Bb4+ with Nc3.
739,24,6,Bd3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPPq3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',?? A blunder on my part. It allows Qxg2 and wins material. But I saw some interesting attacking possibilities in this position black's king is still centralised and yes indeed only one move away from castling but if I can prevent that the open center might prove to give black troubles.
740,24,7,Qa4+,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/QbPP4/2NBB3/PP3PqP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Qa4 to be able to castle queenside. Almost completing development and keeping the option of possibly trapping the queen.
741,24,8,Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/QbPP4/2NBB3/PP3PqP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',IMO the best defence since after 8.... Bd7 9.Qxb4 Qxh1 10.O-O-O exd4 (since any other move bumps into dxe5 and problems with Be4 forking queen and b7
742,24,9,Bxc3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/Q1PP4/2bBB3/PP3PqP/2KR2NR w kq -',again I think this was the only correct move since after Qxh1 dxe5 the knight goes to g4? and then I've got Be4 trapping the queen so Nh5 Nd7 (and Ng8) are the only options Nd2 blocks his LSB and Nh5 just puts the knight out of the game. But Be4 is not an option anymore after Bxc3. It however grants me the option to lose a minor piece rather than a rook with Ne2.
743,24,10,Bxd4,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/Q1Pb4/3BB3/PP2NPqP/2KR3R w kq -',Winning the d-pawn and thus preventing dxe5. Now was the time for some serious planning. I took with the knight on d4 because after castling my bischop would prove far stronger than the knight on d4 eying on the long diagonal and attacking the knight which would become undefended after Rg1 pinning the g7-pawn with tempo on the queen. and if he didn't castle then I would've got two rooks that would jump to the open d- and e-files harassing his king. I also wanted that half open g-file which would put me in a great attacking position.
744,24,11,Qf3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/Q1Pb4/3BBq2/PP2NP1P/2KR2R1 w kq -',Qh3 doesn't do that much.
745,24,12,Ng4,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/Q1PB2n1/3B1q2/PP3P1P/2KR2R1 w kq -',allowing Bxg7! giving up any hopes of kingside castling and as long as my rook stays on the d-file castling queenside will be hard too. The threat of Nxf2 has to be taken into account of course but I found Nxf2 Rg3! and after Nxd3 Rdxd3 I have two connected rooks on the 3rd rank and I'm still threatening to win that h8 rook. I think that O-O would have saved the day. since after O-O what attack does white have? Rg3 Qf4+ and forced Be3 leaving the important a1-h8 diagonal or the more passive Bc3 which can be followed by a simple Kh8 or Bd7 threatening Nd4 with a discovered attack on the queen and after that Ne2+ forcing the exchange of bischops
746,24,13,Qf4+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pBp/2n5/8/Q1P2q2/3R2R1/PP5P/2K5 w kq -',Getting out of the threat with tempo so he can save his rook only...
747,24,14,1Rge3+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pBp/2n5/8/Q1P2q2/3RR3/PP5P/2K5 b kq -',This is also check and I win the h8 rook and in the end get a material advantage.
748,24,15,1Be6,b'r3k2r/ppp2pBp/2n1b3/8/Q1P2q2/3RR3/PP5P/2K5 w kq -',Black has finally moved all of his minor pieces but can't hope to castle just yet. I don't think that taking the rook was a mistake but you have to keep in mind that you might get a hard time defending after such a voyage of the queen in the opening.
749,24,16,Ke7,b'r6B/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P2q2/3RR3/PP5P/2K5 w - -',trying to get the a1 rook involved and unpinning the knight well he wasn't going to castle anyways. 
750,24,17,1Bg7,b'r7/ppp1kpBp/2n1b3/8/Q1P2q2/3RR3/PP5P/2K5 b - -',I didn't want to lose that bischop as it would demolish my fragile material lead. I do however wonder why I didn't play Bc3 immediately as this just allows my opponent to play Rg8 and take another tempo on my bischop.
751,24,18,Rg1+,b'8/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P2q2/2BRR3/PP5P/2K3r1 w - -',My king gets some checks now but he will be perfectly safe on c3
752,24,19,Qxh2+,b'8/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P5/2BRR3/PPK4q/6r1 w - -',Gobbling up a pawn points say material is level what say you? Blacks kingside lonely pawns are not connected but still white doesn't have any passed pawns. The queen moving out of the f-file allowed a new plan to enter my head the queen doesn't cover f6 anymore and that would be an amazing home for my bischop!
753,24,20,2Kb3,b'8/ppp1kp1p/2n1b3/8/Q1P5/1KBRR3/PP5q/6r1 b - -',going to a safe haven.
754,24,21,2a6,b'8/1pp1kp1p/p1n1b3/8/Q1P5/1KBRR3/PP5q/6r1 w - -',a6 probably with the idea of b5 but all help gets too late after Qa3+ Ke8 Bf6 only the queen sac on d6 can provide king safety as the knight on c6 can't block and e7 and d8
755,24,22,2Bf6,b'4k3/1pp2p1p/p1n1bB2/8/2P5/QK1RR3/PP5q/6r1 b - -',Here my opponent resigned for the reasons mentioned above. It was a very interesting game and I am still not convinced that either side had a clear win. I still wonder if the position after Qxg2 was level. anyways thanks for reading comments are appreciated.
756,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Good evening annotated section likers. i have a short and sorta sweet one to ask advice on.
757,25,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',this is about our 8th game against each other. sadly for my opponent I won 7 and we drew one.  i am not picking on this person nor do I consider myself a teacher but he keeps challenging me after each game and there is no bad verbal exchanges between each other.
758,25,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',so i see no reason as why not to grant him the games. i personally dont mind losing versus higher rated opponents just for the greater learning curve. so im able to indulge someone else too.
759,25,3,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',my opponent isnt aggressive at all. he has some sharp play when the game stays pretty classical but each time i threw in a sacrifice of a bishop rook or knight in our previous games the following moves after is when his empire crumbled.
760,25,4,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',and so i believe i had a pretty good grasp of how my opponent plays. Pure defense waiting for his opponent to make a mistake.   this is the cause for my e4  d4 opening with the queen recapture.   ill try a aggressive line i havent played in a year here. instead of my classic bishops opening. ill try to not give my opponent anytime to set up a strong defensive structure as to not make this game a 50 move mind boggle like the last 3.  have to keep my opponent guessing.
761,25,5,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',"hes been managing to make each successive game longer and longer (its as if hes getting used to my antics :D).

i was not surprised at all to not see nc6 here.   our last 3 games also my opponent withheld his castle until after i castled without ever posing any threat to any of my castle opportunities. "
762,25,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',my opponent was wise in his defense.  not always trading. but always traded my LSB if i gave him the chance or would trade out any of my pieces that i was setting up to potentially cause a hole in his wall.  
763,25,7,Be6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',already taking a backrow position with his LSB. ill hold mine back as long as possible not to invite pawn growth queen side or get a forced exchange or loss of tempo.
764,25,8,b3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/8/3QP3/1PN5/P1P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',i didnt feel sending my DSB king side to be wise either not to induce pawn set ups he would like so i thought putting my DSB on b2 to be wiser this game and holding my stronger pieces for long distance attacks.
765,25,9,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/3QP3/1PN5/P1P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',my opponent really liked keeping his development slow and as you can see he is keeping both castle options alive as long as possible
766,25,10,Bb2,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/3QP3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',and so i go on with my plan and told myself ill queen side castle and if he makes 1 or 2 more passive moves im trying to bust in right away
767,25,11,Bf6,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/3pbb2/8/3QP3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',passive move 1 but prevents the immediate castle. so he still has 2 in bank he can play
768,25,12,c6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2ppbb2/8/Q3P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',why am i not surprised he didnt develop his knight.
769,25,13,O-O-O,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2ppbb2/8/Q3P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/2KR1BNR b kq -',i was really hoping to induce a b5 pawn here and was going to sacrifice a knight or my LSB and just see what happens after his replies
770,25,14,Qc7,b'rn2k1nr/ppq2ppp/2ppbb2/8/Q3P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/2KR1BNR w kq -',but to my surprise he played this move.  i reanalysed my plan and his queen move just solidifies which piece i got to sacrifice. the LSB not the knight
771,25,15,Bc4,b'rn2k1nr/ppq2ppp/2ppbb2/8/Q1B1P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/2KR2NR b kq -',and so i play this to induce b5.  i really thought he would play b5 over Bxc4
772,25,16,b5,b'rn2k1nr/p1q2ppp/2ppbb2/1p6/Q1B1P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/2KR2NR w kq b6',and he did!

774,25,18,1cxb5,b'rn2k1nr/p1q2ppp/3pbb2/1p6/Q3P3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/2KR2NR w kq -',retake
775,25,19,1Nxb5,b'rn2k1nr/p1q2ppp/3pbb2/1N6/Q3P3/1P6/PBP2PPP/2KR2NR b kq -',"chomp. thinking.... thinking...... thinking...... thinking........ opponent resigns.        personally i was ""going with the flow""

but was this attack so strong to merit a resignation?  i can easily get his rook. but can i get a checkmate or his queen? i didnt even have time to analyse all the avenues of this nice play or if it even was.

well id like some comments on this one if anyone would indulge me."
776,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I'm not at all surprised that he played this as it's most common.
777,26,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Of course I play my usual Siclian.
778,26,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I thought that he would play the most common move which would be 2.Nf3 and then after 2...d6 he'd played this.  Not a problem however as I'm used to seeing this.  This is the morra gambit which I accept since even if and when he takes back it becomes an exchange and unless I know exactly when my idea is still as long as even exchange early and often against stronger players.
779,26,3,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Of course as I recently learned from GM Susan Polgar of course after this game it's about planning and strategy.  He wants to exchange pawns but I don't know why.  Seeing he has a plan and might get something out of it I don't allow it.
780,26,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Instead I try to do something about my doubled pawns.  I think I see his plan and although not problematic I'm still not crazy about it which is no wonder why I declined.  The idea is that if I take his c pawn he gets to develop his c N right away and it might even become more mobile and strengthen.  Well I don't allow it because Jack has told me that you can't let a N get too strong or powerful.  And you can't let it advance too far as otherwise it'll cause problems.  In a game that I lost he showed an example and how letting that N become too powerful became the costly mistake.  Keeping that in mind I play this.
781,26,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',That does not stop ION from developing his other N however.  I'm not surprised however.
782,26,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile I continue my development.
783,26,7,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So he takes.  I'm not surprised because I knew that white would get his pawn back since the Morra Gambit is not a real Gambit afterall.  It's in fact a similar circumstance to the QGA.
784,26,8,Bb4+,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/1b1PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Determining to put pressure right on the K side I put him right in check.  I also keep in mind that I can lead to an even exchange of pieces which I go for since I'm up against an expert.
785,26,9,Bd2,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/1b1PP3/5N2/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',What I anticipated.  Had he placed his N there however I would've given second thought about the exchange.  But I'm just going by what Mr. Stockel has taught me.
786,26,10,Qxd2,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',I thought he'd follow guidelines an capture with his undeveloped N.  But experts can deviate though.  In this position however I already thought that I had a slight edge with this deviation.  So now I just keep exchanging as everything still comes out even.
787,26,11,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',?! This however is where I wind up getting myself into trouble.  This is where I hyperfocus on development since the idea is as Carlson taught develop your pieces get the K to safety and control the center.  Now as I still must be specific GAC showed a game in a private annotation where a GM did not do that any of that violated all the principles and wound up losing quickly.  I kept that in mind and decided that I didn't want to end up like that GM.  So I figured that this was best.  But what I had to keep to in mind which I forgot here is that there are exceptions to the guidelines which sometimes you can't follow if a threat looms.  I overlooked it.  And while this is not a passer I learned something as I always thought it required a passed pawn.  What I learned is that you don't need a passer for a pawn to be considered dangerous.  I overlooked that and hyperfocusing on opening guidelines has left this N en-prise.  However it is worse then it appears as I'm about to explain.
788,26,12,Nh5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/8/4P2n/3Q4/8/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',"?? At the time I thought that the most important principle was not bringing the Q out too early.  However this was shortly before the lesson that I got with Susan.  The most important is actually a N being grim.  This is where it really applies.  ""try to avoid having pieces undefended.""  That is the exact blunder here.  But I only had one choice which I didn't like that because it required undeveloping the N back to g8 making it more difficult to castle and impossible to do so K side.  But the only option was 10...Ng8 in this position because this move loses a piece.  And it is because of the fact that N is on the edge (end file.)  Had I played the right move however white would still have an advantage because white is better placed."
789,26,13,1g4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/8/4P2n/3Q2P1/8/PP3P1P/RN2KB1R b KQkq g3',It starts with this move.
790,26,14,1Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/ppqp1ppp/8/4P2n/3Q2P1/8/PP3P1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Seeing what he's about to move I start coming out with a nasty plan which is a little unsound.  But doing whatever I can to stay in even if it's unsound aggression.  So the idea is that he can take and when he does I mate.  I know that he won't allow it but the idea is gaining tempo while I attempt to figure out what I can do.  Unfortunately there is nothing but this does delay his plan which was in part my goal.
791,26,15,1Nc3,b'r1b1k2r/ppqp1ppp/8/4P2n/3Q2P1/2N5/PP3P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Not surprised by this move.

Now when takes I take back and despite being down I get a pawn in return.  That's still better then a free piece.  Nontheless it makes it unsafe to castle which puts me at a greater disadvantage.
793,26,17,1e6,b'r1b1k2r/ppqp1p1p/4P3/7p/3Q4/2N5/PP3P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Although not a passer with my other two pawns this one is just as dangerous as I will explain.
794,26,18,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppqp1p1p/4P3/7p/3Q4/2N5/PP3P1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',"?? I really didn't want to castle here with the ""inferior pawn structure.""  That only leaves me with 14...Rf8 after which he would not only have a passed pawn but promote.  Now had analyzed 14...Rf8.  Therefore I was either going to castle or play this move. But he would play 15.e7.  So either he promotes or to prevent that I must capture.  But if I had taken that pawn I'd would be placed in check in with the Q.  After which he would have won it and caused a lot of damage shortly after.  However this loses much more quickly because this gives ION a mate in two starting with his next move."
795,26,19,1Rg1+,b'r1b2rk1/ppqp1p1p/4P3/7p/3Q4/2N5/PP3P1P/R3KBR1 b Q -',I discovered it here and therefore resigned.  That is because 15...Qg3 is forced after which he mates with 16.Rxg3#  In this game we have learned that first there are exceptions to guidelines.  And they must be broken not only if a piece is captured or you get mated but when it leaves a piece en-prise that's when you must deviate and play something else to prevent the threat.  Second the most important principle is not to place the N on the rim unless absolutely needed because similar to the game with Karpov 10...Nh5 lost a piece which soon after sealed my fate.

That said keep in mind that both players have a 5:00 clock where 15 seconds are added for each move."
806,28,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Anyway we begin with the Sicilian. I might play 1 ...e5 when I've decided shenanigans from classical King's Pawn games don't bother me anymore. That probably won't be for years frankly.
807,28,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This variation of the Sicilian is considered inferior to most lines most popular being the Open variation (2. Nf3) or the Closed (2. Nc3). The idea is Black wants to plan a strong d5 push and without a pawn on c4 for White that bishop will go under fire the moment he plays this and White will lose tempo in preparing against it. White still has ample opportunity but not as much as other lines in my opinion.
808,28,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Like I said Black's idea is wanting a strong grip on a d5 pawn push. Also the DSB is ready to protect the pawn on c5. This is the main line.
809,28,4,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Rather passive for White. Protecting e4 but Black isn't gearing to seize that square yet. Meanwhile the LSB is blocked out from the rest of the board entirely. Maybe planning to play Bg5 one day without needing to worry about the center but this move gives Black a lot of breathing space.
810,28,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Gripping the d4-e5 squares before White can get there. If White wants to push further ahead down the board he will have to start reacting to my development now.
811,28,6,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This keeps the knight out of the 4th rank. Perhaps White doesn't like getting harassed by minor pieces so early on in the game.
812,28,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Putting more support on d5 while preparing for Bg5 from White.
813,28,8,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But instead White enables castling and continues trying to build his defenses.
814,28,9,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',So I begin the first attack.
815,28,10,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/2B5/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White has little reason to decline the exchange. Black has little reason to play Knight takes.
816,28,11,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White did have a few other options here however. Qe2+ probably would be a bad idea as Be7 would just accelerate Black's castling. Then Bb3 was there which could have been a good alternative in order to bring the bishop to c2 pairing the bishops as you would in the Ruy Lopez. But frankly White's LSB is rather cramped by the d3 pawn and isn't very good in this game than if it could retreat to e2. Is it worth it for White to consider preserving his bishop here?
817,28,12,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I'm not worried if White captures and if he doesn't the knight will free itself very soon.
818,28,13,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Instead he moves to hide the kings.
819,28,14,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I oblige. Again I don't care enough about the knight to play ...Bd7 undermining the d5 pawn once the Queen no longer protects it.
820,28,15,bxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Instead I'm happier to give d5 an extra defender and putting Bb7 on the cards.
821,28,16,1Nbd2,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White continues to develop clearly behind Black's part.
822,28,17,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p5/3p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I thought Black might be overreaching a little with this move but on the other hand I believed White gets hurt with the pawn stuck on d3. It blocks the White Queen from the center and should White exchange pawns then my pawns no longer double and d3 is forever stranded.
823,28,18,1Qa4,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p5/Q2p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',The Queen couldn't attack d4 from d1 very effectively but I neglected this fork. With c6 left hanging and d4 attacked a third time I needed to figure out how to cut my losses.
824,28,19,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/2p2n2/2p5/Q2p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I decide to defend the weakest pawn. I'm not as sure anymore what would have happened if I went with ...dxc3 but I guess I wanted to leave White's d pawn stranded without having to worry about White's Queen being relatively safe in the Black camp. It doesn't look like White has any winning moves down that way but why get so nervous with a Queen being so close in the first place?
825,28,20,1cxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/2p2n2/2p5/Q2P4/3P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So I lose the exchange. I'm down that pawn so there's no sense trading further.
826,28,21,1a6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1p2n2/2p5/Q2P4/3P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Looking at this further I guess I'd mark this move with a (?). This would have been more effective if I still had a b-pawn but I guess this pawn is better off with the bishop guarding it as well?
827,28,22,1Qb3,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1p2n2/2p5/3P4/1Q1P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I was more concerned about White having a plan to bring the knight in to c4 to harass my pieces on b6 but I guess he had other ideas.
828,28,23,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/p1p2n2/2p5/3P4/1Q1P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',My Queen defends eyeing h2 and joining the rooks.
829,28,24,Bxc5,b'r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p2n2/2b5/8/1Q1P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',White then forces this exchange. At first I thought it was rather pointless because the pawn was fairly well posted on c5. 
830,28,25,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p2n2/2b5/4N3/1Q1P1N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',But no this happens. This is the first exchange I have to seriously consider. White is giving up a knight opening his bishop attacking a loose piece and a piece linked to the king guarded only by Pawn in front of it. It's clearly being given up here and I'm being forced to choose which piece I'd rather keep.
831,28,26,1Nxe4,b'r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p5/2b5/4n3/1Q1P1N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',And in the end the board is very open right down the middle. My bishop is on the right diagonal to harass and if I let the bishop be captured on c5 my ability to defend the Queenside looks scary at best so I force the pair of knights off. The DSB is clearly better for Black to want to keep.
832,28,27,1dxe4,b'r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p5/2b5/4P3/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Meanwhile this pawn just might end up uniting with the f pawn some day. My pieces might be slightly more active for the time being but White's gaining more space and I need to make sure I have enough counterplay to make the material disadvantage worth having on my part.
833,28,28,1Ba7,b'r4rk1/bbq2ppp/p1p5/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So I hide away the bishop pair. White's King is in an unfortunate corner now; it definitely looks like my bishops are going to be stronger than his uncoordinated Bishop/Knight team.
834,28,29,1Be3,b'r4rk1/bbq2ppp/p1p5/8/4P3/1Q2BN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White notices this too and begins trying to force one of the bishops off. Black must figure a way to keep White at bay and develop more grip on the board or simple exchanges will force me to get defensive after the board clears up some more.
835,28,30,1c5,b'r4rk1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4P3/1Q2BN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',And to my fortune the White LSB's sacrifice seems to be in complete vain at this point.
836,28,31,1Qc2,b'r4rk1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4P3/4BN2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White's really wanting to exchange those pieces now.
837,28,32,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4P3/4BN2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',And I defend.
838,28,33,1g3,b'2r2rk1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4P3/4BNP1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',A mistake. White has a certain idea in mind but I think it misses the mark entirely.
839,28,34,1Rfe8,b'2r1r1k1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4P3/4BNP1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',Black now has total control of e4 and after g3 the light squares around the White King are weak. e5 is no longer an option.
840,28,35,2Bf4,b'2r1r1k1/bbq2ppp/p7/2p5/4PB2/5NP1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',White still tries to help matters by going through with the plan of harrassing the Queen.
841,28,36,2Bxe4,b'2r1r1k1/b1q2ppp/p7/2p5/4bB2/5NP1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',And I could have declined by placing the Queen on c6 but I felt I gained more by hitting the other Queen back with equal material. With tempo- the White bishop must retreat after the Black Queen is captured. Black's bishop is safe on c2.
842,28,37,Bxc2,b'2r1r1k1/b1B2ppp/p7/2p5/8/5NP1/PPb2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',And after some time White accepts the queen trade. Black must accept as well.
843,28,38,2Bf4,b'2r1r1k1/b4ppp/p7/2p5/5B2/5NP1/PPb2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',Also on the cards was Bd6 and Ba5 but I'm not entirely convinced either are better for White. Bd6 is easily harassed by a rook on d8 and the posting isn't as great for the piece on a5.
844,28,39,2h6,b'2r1r1k1/b4pp1/p6p/2p5/5B2/5NP1/PPb2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',I took about a minute to carefully consider how Black should proceed. Frankly none of my minor pieces need to move at this time and with my kingside pawns more free after the Queen no longer pins f7 I felt now was a good time to start gaining more ground on my pawn structure.
845,28,40,2Ne5,b'2r1r1k1/b4pp1/p6p/2p1N3/5B2/6P1/PPb2P1P/R4RK1 b - -',I believe White was trying to restrict Black's LSB options or allow a rook on e1 but...
846,28,41,2Bb8,b'1br1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1N3/5B2/6P1/PPb2P1P/R4RK1 w - -',...now the Knight is a weakness. c5 is no longer attacked and if the Knight moves White's King safety becomes compromised after the bishop exchange.
847,28,42,2Rfc1,b'1br1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1N3/5B2/6P1/PPb2P1P/R1R3K1 b - -',A fair idea except I'd prefer both Rac1 and Ree1 more than this. Both Rfc1 and Rae1 make the White rook team a little awkward and cramped. Now comes a tough call for Black. Which bishop must be kept?
848,28,43,2Bf5,b'1br1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1Nb2/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/R1R3K1 w - -',And I picked the Light bishop- a key turning point decision this match. It's true that most opposite color Bishops result in easy draw outcomes but this is where reading the board becomes highly important. If my dark bishop can always trade down with White's I don't need to worry too much about battling the dark squares as much except most of White's pieces dominate the dark squares. There is a much higher degree of vulnerability on the light squares- especially those around White's King. With the material more equal and my pawns typically farther along than White's I need to consider what the endgame exchanges are going to look like but if I can control all this light-square exposure using the LSB it has a higher value to Black than the dark one. 
849,28,44,2Rce1,b'1br1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1Nb2/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',Black's next target is clear so the Knight is defended.
850,28,45,2Bxe5,b'2r1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1bb2/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',At any rate even had I let the LSB fall on c2 what would have likely happened is another exchange on f4 and I wasn't keen on that. I wanted to keep a Bishop for now especially one that could irritate White's control of the board. Sure I could double White's pawns on the f file but my pawns are also uncoordinated on the Queenside. All and all it'd be rather equal so I believed Black's game to be better with the opposite bishops.
851,28,46,2Rxe5,b'2r1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1Rb2/5B2/6P1/PP3P1P/R5K1 b - -',White's rook captures here offering more exchanges kicking the bishop and pressuring c5.
852,28,47,2Bh3,b'2r1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1R3/5B2/6Pb/PP3P1P/R5K1 w - -',This was always the intended home of the bishop.
853,28,48,2Rh5,b'2r1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p4R/5B2/6Pb/PP3P1P/R5K1 b - -',White thinks he should chase the bishop off h3...
854,28,49,2Re5,b'2r1r1k1/5pp1/p6p/2p1R3/5Bb1/6P1/PP3P1P/R5K1 b - -',...and only manages to waste a tempo on it.
855,28,50,2g5,b'2r1r1k1/5p2/p6p/2p1R1p1/5Bb1/6P1/PP3P1P/R5K1 w - g6',Hitting the DSB and blocking the Rook's path to h5 making my bishop even stronger.
856,28,51,Rxe8,b'4r1k1/5p2/p6p/2p3p1/5Bb1/6P1/PP3P1P/R5K1 w - -',White continues to simplify.

858,28,53,3Rc8,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/2p3p1/6b1/6P1/PP3P1P/R5K1 w - -',I defend it.

860,28,55,3c4,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/6p1/2p3b1/6P1/PP3P1P/2R3K1 w - -',Now the bishop is pointless.

862,28,57,3c3,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/6p1/6b1/1Pp3P1/P4P1P/2R3K1 w - -',The pawn continues to walk. And at this point a certain idea is born into my mind...
863,28,58,3Kg2,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/6p1/6b1/1Pp3P1/P4PKP/2R5 b - -',White's King tries to cut my bishop off with f3 in mind.
864,28,59,3Be2,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/6p1/8/1Pp3P1/P3bPKP/2R5 w - -',I'm too developed- his King still has nowhere good to go and now I threaten ...g4.
865,28,60,3b4,b'2r3k1/5p2/p2B3p/6p1/1P6/2p3P1/P3bPKP/2R5 b - -',White tries to cut my path off to the pawn again.
866,28,61,3Bc5,b'2r3k1/5p2/p6p/2B3p1/1P6/6P1/P1p1bPKP/2R5 b - -',And he pushes ahead with the idea thinking he's done it except...
867,28,62,3Bd1,b'2r3k1/5p2/p6p/2B3p1/1P6/6P1/P1p2PKP/2Rb4 w - -',In reality White's now playing an endgame with a Pawn and Bishop against my rook.
868,28,63,3f3,b'2r3k1/5p2/p6p/2B3p1/1P6/5PP1/P1p3KP/2Rb4 b - -',So the King starts trying to get into the game.
869,28,64,Rb5,b'6k1/5p2/p6p/1rB3p1/1P6/5PP1/P1p2K1P/2Rb4 w - -',This was a little unfortunate though. The idea was to remove the pawn on b4 and promote after placing the rook on b1 but simply pushing ...a5 instead of this would have forced it.
870,28,65,3a4,b'6k1/5p2/p6p/1rB3p1/PP6/5PP1/2p2K1P/2Rb4 b - a3',So White plays this forever pushing my rook out of the Queenside. 
871,28,66,3a5,b'6k1/1r3p2/p6p/P1B3p1/1P6/5PP1/2p2K1P/2Rb4 b - -',Now the a6 pawn is pretty much out of the game but White can't ever advance ground on b5 without more help and without the White King it's just not going to happen.
872,28,67,3f5,b'6k1/1r6/p6p/P1B2pp1/1P6/5PP1/2p2K1P/2Rb4 w - f6',Now I decide I need to get my King into the game.
873,28,68,Rd7,b'6k1/3r4/p6p/P1B2pp1/1P6/4KPP1/2p4P/2Rb4 w - -',-just in enough time to stop the White King from going where he's needed.
874,28,69,4Bd4,b'6k1/3r4/p6p/P4pp1/1P1B4/4KPP1/2p4P/2Rb4 b - -',That extra flight square is given but it's too late to stop my King from arriving to the center.
875,28,70,4h3,b'8/3r1k2/p6p/P4pp1/1P1B4/4KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 b - -',I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Kd3 looks much better to me for drawing chances and I was surprised not seeing it.
876,28,71,4Ke6,b'8/3r4/p3k2p/P4pp1/1P1B4/4KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 w - -',White can no longer stop my King from advancing.
877,28,72,4Bc3,b'8/3r4/p3k2p/P4pp1/1P6/2B1KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 b - -',Perhaps worried about me winning the bishop on d4 but it wasn't really all that likely to happen.
878,28,73,4Rd5,b'8/8/p3k2p/P2r1pp1/1P6/2B1KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 w - -',Reinforcing my position and refusing to allow the White King any more ground.
879,28,74,4Kf2,b'8/8/p3k2p/P2r1pp1/1P6/2B2PPP/2p2K2/2Rb4 b - -',He retreats and sends a Draw offer... thinking I can't advance any further?
880,28,75,4Ke3,b'8/3k4/p6p/P2r1pp1/1P6/2B1KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 b - -',And now he sees the problem.
881,28,76,4Kc6,b'8/8/p1k4p/P2r1pp1/1P6/2B1KPPP/2p5/2Rb4 w - -',It's curtains for White after ...Kc4.
882,28,77,4Ra1,b'8/8/p1k4p/P2r1pp1/1P6/2B1KPPP/2p5/R2b4 b - -',So the Rook comes out to stop me from going around the pawns.
883,28,78,4Ra3,b'8/8/p6p/Pk1r1pp1/1P6/R1B1KPPP/2p5/3b4 b - -',Now he notices c4 is a square and overlooks one GIANT blunder.
884,28,79,4c1=Q+,b'8/8/p6p/Pk1r1pp1/1P6/R1B1KPPP/8/2qb4 w - -',And White resigns here. Funny enough we both had strong clocks at the end of this match! I had over 9 minutes and he had a bit over 7. Still it was a great match and the decision that carried Black's win through to the end was definitely in going to the opposite bishop game! Lesson learned- material is not the only advantage worth considering in exchanges! Thanks for reading!

At this time I felt sort of at a crossroads: either defend my king and I had the feeling it was sort of late (I should have started a few moves back) or committing my pieces to attack the left flank. And I saw what I thought it was an interesting sacrifice. It took me more than a minute to make up my mind but after movement 19 I replied with two quick movements trying to put some pressure on black.

1047,36,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So I copy it again.
1048,36,4,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is also a good move attacking e5.

The move attacks f7 again but this is easily defended against. Making mistakes in the opening like this can easily but stopped on Gameknot by using the on-line opening databases which are quite legal.

"
1086,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The oldest move in the book. I prefer d4 over e4 but it's a matter of personal taste. e4 suits his preferences far better.
1087,37,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian. Knowing Bert I figured we'd be playing the Alapin variation. It's an interesting anti Sicilian weapon that you don't see all that often these days but it's an opening that has been played by players of all levels for decades.
1088,37,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',And we're playing the Alapin. The Alapin is also sometimes refered to as the anti-Sicilian. It's a pain in the ass to play against if you're not familiar with the main lines and if black somewhat cooperates than it can quickly transpose into main lines of different openings. For example it could transpose into a main line of the advanced French Defense if black responds with d5 which was long thought to be the best move after 1. e4 c5 2. c3 d5 3. e5. It can also transpose into a main line of a declined Smith Morra gambit if white plays the most popular move Nf6 via 1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5. Playing e6 which prepares d5 is arguably the most solid response by black but is also closely related to the French defense and thus very often transposes into it. There are more examples but I think you can catch the gist. The Alapin is used to draw Sicilian players into openings they're not familiar with and as a result often proves fatal for unprepared players. Both sides have to know the core ideas behind the transposition they'll move into.
1089,37,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I choose for the Nf6 variation since I'm not confident in my ability to win against my opponent in an advanced French. The rest from here is known theory so I will not bother annotating the next few moves.
1090,37,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/2Bp4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The first move that's not maintheory. The maintheory would follow with 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. cxd4. for as far as I'm aware. There's probably theory around this move as well but I tried to ask myself why is Bc4 not the main move? And it occured to me that the knight on d5 is easily attacked. The reason is because we get to play Nb6 chasing away the bishop and putting the knight on a pretty good square.
1091,37,5,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1n6/4P3/3p4/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The other option in the gameknot database Bd3 has rather bad results. This is the only real option for the bishop in my opinion.
1092,37,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3p4/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',After this move I'm sort of in the dark for as far as theory goes. It probably continues with d6 though after that I'm not sure if I'd want to develop the dark squared bishop via a fianchetto. Also an extra note which I thought of a week after playing this game: I could have played dxc3 which a lot of lower rated players most likely would have done and which I seriously considered mind you. However that allows Nxc3. After which white has an overwhelming lead in development and enough space in my opinion to do something with it. dxc3 Nxc3 Nc6 and white is doing just fine. In this position White can even got as far as consider the move f4 in my opinion and really cramp Black's position. Either that or Nf3 d6 Bf6. Black can't respond with dxe5 because of Nxe5 targeting the f7 square. Nxe5 Bxe5 is probably needed after that. Then it's questionable what Black plays. The trade of queens means a centralised rook on an already vulnerable position so it's most likely not the answer. Developing the light squared bishop probably gets met with Nb5 threatening a fork and really pouring on the pressure. e6 trying to develop the dark squared bishop has the same problem. Then there's f6 chasing away the bishop but it can just retreat and then continue it's attack with the Nb5 combination later. That is of course but one variation black isn't forced to play d6 after all but I think you get my point when I say that white gets adequate compensation.
1093,37,7,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/3P4/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',e6! According to my opponent it's not the most active nor most played variation. If someone could be so good to inform me what the most popular reply is you'd have my gratitude. The position reminds me of some strange French defence. Black has to be incredibly careful here because the f7 pawn is rather weak and white might have ideas of f4.
1094,37,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/3P4/1BN5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Developing another piece and watching over the e4 and d5 square. The pin of Bb4 seems good but I have my doubts wether or not I can afford to wait a move to undermine his center.
1095,37,9,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nnpp3/4P3/3P4/1BN5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I was considering to play d5 but I think a trade has to be forced here. If white develops solidly then black's position will eventually get too cramped and his light squared bishop will become a nightmare. Also it's hard for my knights to reach the other side of the board right now where they'll eventually be needed. if a trade is forced then my knights will probably get a little more room to move so that I can eventually develop my light squared bishop. I anticipate Bf4 developing a minor piece as well as aiding in the dxe issue.
1096,37,10,Bf4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nnpp3/4P3/3P1B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',As anticipated probably the best response.
1097,37,11,1dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Bxe5 wouldn't work because of f6 so this is the correct way to recapture. Now the queens are staring at each other.
1098,37,12,1Qxd1+,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2qK1NR w KQkq -',This might not be neccesary but I think his queen was going to prove stronger then mine in the end. The plan is 11. Rxd1  Bb4 12. Nf3 O-O 13. O-O After that I can start working on moving my knight on b6 so that eventually I can play b6 and Bb7.
1099,37,13,1Rxd1,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR b Kkq -',At this point it was time to asses the position. Bert told me that he was quite pleased about his position but that he doesn't like his dark squared bishop which indeed isn't too great. I think Black's position is quite decent and rather easy to play. The plans for both sides should be to finish development and improve our bad pieces. In my case it's my bishop on c8 in his case his bishop on g4. The position is in my opinion slightly in favor of white because black has a hard time gaining presence in the center but black's position is really solid and thus hard to break through.
1100,37,14,1Bb4,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/1b3B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR w Kkq -',Pinning the knight and developing to a good square. Bc5 targets the weak f2 square but Black has no presence to take advantage of it so I chose Bb4 instead.
1101,37,15,1Bg5,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P1B1/1b6/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR b Kkq -',Questionable in my opinion but it has its merits. Black could grab a pawn here but it gets met by Rd8 checkmate. Aside from setting up that obvious little trap there's more merit to this namely getting his bishop to a better square. I decide to get my king to safety.
1102,37,16,1f4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P1B1/1b3P2/1BN5/PP4PP/3RK1NR b K f3',Didn't see this one coming but it fits our vision to always play for a win.. I'm not sure how this attack would work but it'll be interesting to see how he pulls it off. I think adding more pawns to the attack is too dangerous but probably neccesary if you go all-out. His king has already become quite a bit more vulnerable now though. I think it was better for white to just develop and play some positional chess ( though that's the type of chess he dislikes and I'm best at ).  It's not quite clear how black should proceed from here.
1103,37,17,1Na5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/1BN5/PP4PP/3RK1NR w K -',This is the move I come up with. It not only attacks the bishop with the intention of giving him doubled pawns but also frees the a4-e8 diagonal for my bishop to move into after Bd7. After that my rooks will be connected and I can maybe punish his questionable king safety. Black should be better here.
1104,37,18,1Bc2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/2N5/PPB3PP/3RK1NR b K -',Moving the bishop out of the way.

I should have seen this much coming. Now he's threatening the classic Bf6 or Bh6 type of threat. His bishop on c2 is also looking directly at my king which I don't like one bit. I'll have to consider how to deal with that the next upcoming move. I can't let allow him to play Rxg7."
1109,37,23,1Kh8,b'2r2r1k/pp1b1ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/2N3R1/PPB3PP/4K1NR w K -',I chose Kh8 as my defense. I came to the conclusion that Bxh7 isn't really much of a threat since his rook and bishop aren't enough to checkmate me by themselves. This also makes him unable to play the Bh6/Bf6 ideas because I can just take and my king will still be sufficiently safe considering the limited amount of pieces he'll have to attack with. I considered g6 as well in this positon but with a pawn on e5 he'd just play his bishop on the f6 square which is really annoying especially if he's going to move his knight over from g1 all the way to for example g5. He could create some massive threats then.  Now that I temporarily got some breathing room the next plan on my agenda should be the isolated pawn and to get rid of the strong bishop on g5.
1110,37,24,1a3,b'2r2r1k/pp1b1ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/P1N3R1/1PB3PP/4K1NR b K -',Chasing away the bishop and tempting me to play Bxc3. I believe in the weakness of his isolated pawn he believes in the strenght of the bishop pair in an endgame. This is why I like chess it's essentially a clash of ideas.

Not only because it just is but because I was going to grind him down into a winning endgame this holds more chances for him. Essentially White's attack can't be stopped now but black will win some material as compensation. There's 2 options here. 20. Bf6 Re8 accepting that Rxh6 follows after which Black plays 21. Rxh6 Kg8. 22. Bh7+ Kf8 23. Rh3 gxf6. 24. exf6 Nd5! After which black can stop checkmate because he can stop the f6 pawn giving black room to flee. The other option is one with a forced repetition which is most likely to be played. That happens after 20. ... gxf6 21. Rh3+ Kg8 22. Bh7+ Kh8 23. Bc2 etc. which is a draw by repetition. There's also another variation which is also drawish and can also be a draw by repetition if the response to gxf6 is exf6. After which white plays Rfd8 Rxh6+ g8 with another draw by repetition or a king chase if he so desires. I hope we're just going for the second option. I'm not confident in my ability to flee all over the map.

White can win the bishop on b5 and although tempting I'm not sure if it actually wins for white. White's king is rather vulnerable over there and black should have little trouble regaining material.

It's interesting though because several moves ago this would have been the correct move. The position isn't easy to play for white either the reason why Ne2 doesn't work is because White in this position would have wanted to play Rh3 at some point chasing away my rook from that strong 3th rank. Before you can play that you need a knight on g1 in case Black captures  as to prevent another set of doubled pawns. With a knight on e2 the rook can't develop itself properly. It's not a superobvious mistake and I think we can say that this move is the first big inaccuracy ( or even blunder ) in the game.

If I want to get checkmate then I'll have to involve my knights anyway. This however is a mistake. Better is Ne3 aiming for the fork on g4 after which black should have an easy game. He can prevent the fork but my knight will be far too powerful to stop.

This gives him the advantage as he might be able to gobble up material during a barrage of checks or even worse maybe pin my king in front of my queen which would mean I lose.
1149,37,63,5f3,b'8/3B4/5k2/p6P/4p1K1/5p2/4n3/8 w - -',I play f3 because I'm not scared of the pawnrace. As soon as he plays h7 I play Kg7 making him unable to promote.

After that his king is too far away from my 2 pawns to stop me from promoting even if he were to play Bb5 somewhere i can just play e3 e2 Bxe2 fxe2 and he can't stop the promotion. Not recapturing the knight means I get a free pawn for nothing and my king can get involved in the defense of my 2 pawns as it doesn't have to look over the g7 square anymore.
1152,37,66,5Kh2,b'8/3B4/5k2/p6P/4pn2/5p2/7K/8 b - -',He realises that after Kh4 Nxg5 Kxh5 he won't be able to reach my pawns in time.

1155,37,69,Ng3+,b'8/8/2B5/p7/5k2/4ppn1/8/5K2 w - -',And here he resigns. It's difficult for black not to promote a pawn here. I'm pretty sure we both can still play a little better then this. Undoubtedly the locations at which he played ( he made numerous moves on the bus for example ) and me being distracted ( I'm a fan of multitasking ) had some factor in at least 1 or 2 moves we played. It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen in the tournament. I pray we don't have to play each other but if we do we'll play our hearts out I'm sure.

Dieharder (Chris) a Class D player wanted somebody to annotate one of his games.  Well I will do my best to step up to the plate here.  I thought I would choose a hard earned victory over a Class C 1400 player as this can potentially be a lot of meat for the Inquest Jury to feast on.  The game starts with 1. e4 of which black responds c5.  This is the Sicilian Defense folks!

However white must be careful as a check on h4 could still potentially cause a few problems.

It really was a tale of a rook winning skewer and a rook winning knight fork.  The lesson here is to watch out for your king being checked on the rank or file by an enemy rook and if that is the case make sure that there is nothing of value behind it that cannot be defended.  Secondly watch out for enemy knights that are close to your king on a rank and file with just one space between them.  That knight can check your king and anything else on the end of its l' shape.  Also if the knight is on an adjacent diagonal square with no spaces between king and enemy knight then you can also get checked.  Your king is safe from knight checks if the enemy knight is just one square adjacent to your king on rank and file and one square apart on the diagonal.  It is worth knowing this to avoid losing heavy material.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Kind regards - Joanne

1188,39,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/P6P/1PP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I decided to go for a French-like defense taking advantage of the poor development white is doing.
1189,39,3,dxc5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2Pp4/8/P4N1P/1PP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not common to accept on c5 it opens that flank for black to attack and also releases the Bbishop freely

1191,39,5,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/1bn1pn2/3p4/1P6/P4N1P/1BP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Sort of forced. You can feel some preassure now on the BK castling and I started to feel uneasy here. But still black seems to be positioning his pieces nicely.
1192,39,6,Nbd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/1bn1pn2/3p4/1P6/P4N1P/1BPNPPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Still seems that e3 is more important but Nbd2 is also ok since supports a future c4 or even e4.
1193,39,7,a6,b'r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/pbn1pn2/3p4/1P6/P4N1P/1BPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Maybe not needed now but I didn´t like the perspective to lose that diagonal in case more pressure comes to my BB in b6.

Black has his chances on the queen´s flank since it has an open ""c"" column but white doesn´t seem to be that bad: no clear threats on the King´s side yet."

But the moment I did the move I begun to think of possibilities to attack the center since WK is still in his initial position.
1197,39,11,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/pbn2n2/3pN3/1P6/P2BP2P/1BPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ -',Better taking with the N instead of the powerful bishop it seems...  White has not let me get away with this so it is not that naive as the opening reflects.

If WB retires to c3 or back to b2 black can try to block the bishops with d4 (countered by e4 thus blocking B in d3) and then try to exploit the situation moving the rook to e6 and B in b6 to d7. Too many moves I know but an interesting plan anyways.

Bg3 seemed to be a conservative but good idea.
1200,39,14,1Qxf6,b'r1b1r1k1/1p3ppp/pb3q2/3p4/1P6/P2BP2P/2PN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',Now the picture seems to be more than good for black even with one pawn down. Check the potential sacrifice on h3 thanks to that initial pawn movement there. It will hurt white a lot.
1201,39,15,Re5,b'r1b3k1/1p3ppp/pb3q2/3pr3/1P6/P2BP2P/2PN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',BQ doesn´t seem to be more active in a different square so no need to remove it to allow the rook play on the 6th line as planned before. True that Rook will not be as safe as in the 6th but white cannot cover both g5 and h5 with N and B. BB sacrifice on h3 is pending but much more clear and menacing now.

1203,39,17,1Be2,b'r1b3k1/1p3ppp/pb3q2/3p3r/1P6/P3PN1P/2P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now this is a grave but unclear mistake. I had thought of this while playing and that´s why I did Rh5. But I didn´t see a more interesting defense for white: a direct 16.Nh2. Queen threats R in h5 and at the same time N can position in a place that will not interrupt B in e2 (if decided to go there). Black doesn´t have time to prepare Bc7 and Queen on mate position this way. Still black has a promising attack in case of 16.Nh2 but after a light analysis not that clear. Maybe 16...Rg5 can counteract Nh2 but nothing straight comes from that to me.

1206,39,20,1c4,b'r1b3k1/1pb2ppp/p2q4/3p3r/1PPQ4/P3PN1P/4BPP1/R4RK1 b - c3',18.Qf4 seems to be a must here.
1207,39,21,1Bxh3,b'r5k1/1pb2ppp/p2q4/3p3r/1PPQ4/P3PN1b/4BPP1/R4RK1 w - -',With the idea of ...Qg6 if not taken.
1208,39,22,1c5,b'r5k1/1pb2ppp/p2q4/2Pp3r/1P1Q4/P3PN1b/4BPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Facilitating the threat. I case of gxh3 I´d say Rxh3 solves the game threatening both Qg6+ and Rxf3 and mate in h2.
1209,39,23,2g3,b'r5k1/1pb2ppp/p5q1/2Pp3r/1P1Q4/P3PNPb/4BP2/R4RK1 b - -',Didn´t see this I must confess. But when you have your pieces in position you have plenty of solutions to come out with.
1210,39,24,2Bxg3,b'r5k1/1p3ppp/p5q1/2Pp3r/1P1Q4/P3PNbb/4BP2/R4RK1 w - -',Victory is ours!
1211,39,25,Qg2#,b'r5k1/1p3ppp/p7/2Pp3r/1P1Q4/P2BPN1b/5PqK/R4R2 w - -',"A nice ending for a nice game. What started to seem like a boring game ended up with an interesting position and since I consider my rival did not do so bad in the middle game when you have developmental problems at home you don´t have too many options to come back. An instructive game to show the importance to finish your development properly (unless you have a good reason to do ""odd"" movements."
