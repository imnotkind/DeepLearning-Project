114,3,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I've been experimenting with the King's Indian Attack.  I often get interesting positions although I've occasionally gotten really lousy positions.  Mostly because I don't know what I'm doing yet.
115,3,1,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Played to prevent e4.

117,3,3,b5,b'r2qk2r/p1p2pp1/2np1n2/1pb1p2p/4P1bP/2PP1NP1/PP3PB1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',Now this didn't make sense to me.  Wouldn't Black want to preserve the Queenside pawn structure for 0-0-0 later?  Or what about some follow-through on the Kingside like Rg8 Nh7 g5?
118,3,4,Bg5,b'r2qk2r/p1p2pp1/2np1n2/1pb1p1Bp/4P1bP/2PP1NP1/PP3PB1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',One drawback of h5 is that it allows this pin.  Bg5 also prevents the advance of the g pawn.

120,3,6,1bxc3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2pp1/2np1n2/2b1p1Bp/4P1bP/2PP1NP1/P1Q2PB1/RN3RK1 b - -',I thought about Nxc3 intending Nd5 but I wasn't keen on allowing Nd4 for Black.  Right now Black's Ns don't have a lot of squares.

126,3,12,1Ng5,b'r4rk1/2pq1p2/2np4/4pbNp/p6P/2PPP1P1/P1Q3B1/R4RK1 b - -',Since Black's Q is overloaded this threatens Bxc6 followed by Rxf5.

135,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',With Jack Stockel though I have a difficult time figuring out if he'll play 1.d4 or 1.e4  He usually starts off with the QPO with the idea of playing the QG which I decline.  But once he plays this I answer with my usual.  Now the next couple of moves are standard.
136,4,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"But I was surprised to see this.  The mainline continues with 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 as that's what he taught me.  As the saying goes however ""Don't trust your opponent.""  Once he deviates I'm going to play it differently myself by developing and threatening his pawn."
137,4,2,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not to my surprise he protects.  But figuring that 3.c3 was inaccurate I decide to continue developing by pinning his Nf4.  What comes to mind is what Ken recently taught me which is that it's not a good idea to break the pin with 4...Be2  So another way of saying it is that I'm trying to put compromises and even on Jack's position.
138,4,3,Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! But he breaks the pin anyway.  So even though the move is inaccurate with what Ken said my instincts and thoughts were still correct because he did teach me that the most common way to break the pin is with the B whether the pin is on the K or Q side.
139,4,4,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Meanwhile I continue with my development.

141,4,6,g6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Since it's not an type of Indian Defense combined with the fact that I didn't fianchetto on the other side and that the e square is somewhat cramped which would limit the B I do not hesitate or consider anything else other then fianchettoing at once because I have nice long and thus comfortable diagonal for my Bf8.  All I'm interested in is castling at this point so my thinking is solely based on that.
142,4,7,d4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/3PP1b1/2P2N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',He puts a temporary stop to that as I cannot let Jack win a pawn here.
143,4,8,Bg7,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3PP1b1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',But now I take advantage of the opportunity to put the B on the long diagonal as noted earlier.  Since it's exchanged it's the same idea as nothing else was going to come into consideration.
144,4,9,d5,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/3P4/4P1b1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Of course this move delays castling as I need to protect my N.  After which he decides to exchange and I have no problem accepting.  That's because this time I feel that Jack is not making the best choices because he just like what I learned from Ken might need those pieces later on.  The problem with this thought process is that I'm already starting to become overly confident which I've done in other games and it'll show in the end which will later on lead to my downfall.
145,4,10,Bxe2,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/3PN3/4P3/8/PP1NbPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I had a long think about Good or Bad bishops.  At first I thought his B was the weak one and thus was not going to exchange.  But looking more into it I realize that there might be potential for this to become dangerous.  As such I changed my mind and decided that his Be2 was good Bishop that's why I decided to take as it's being exchanged for my bad Bishop.
146,4,11,1Qb5+,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/5np1/1Q1Pp3/4P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I was surprised to see the check.  I asked myself if not exchanging would've prevented it and the answer is no since it was on a different diagonal.
147,4,12,1Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/6p1/1Q1Pp3/4P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I had a hard time figuring out how to get out of check.  At first I thought that I had lost castling rights.  But then I realized that this was the other way to get out of check.  And it's the only that I can castle.  Therefore I was going to get out this way since almost nothing else comes into consideration besides castling.  I also kept in mind that he's going to take on b7.  Unlike with the previous pawn it does not bother me because of what I learned from GM Susan Polgar about the London System.  What she said is that taking that pawn is known to be dangerous and thus blunderous because the Q usually gets trapped.  And when it does not there are ways to get the Rook.  So I'm trying to apply what I learned from her for this game even though it started off with a completely different opening.  The problem is that it won't work here but I'm hopeful.  And it does work several moves later when Jack plays a different move which will turn out to be a super blunder.
148,4,13,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pQ1nppbp/6p1/3Pp3/4P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',In the end all I care about is the fact that I could castle.  I did however consider delaying this with 13...a6 with the idea being to trap the Q using the Polgar method.  But I looked at variations after that and in all of them there's no way to trap the Q.
149,4,14,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pQ1nppbp/6p1/3Pp3/4P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Meanwhile Jack castles as well.  And now I go for it by attacking the Queen with 14...Nc5.  That's because in those variations Susan also mentioned that this is a different way of trapping it in the London System.  I know that Jack's options are limited but he finds a move that gets his Q out.  In the process my Knight gets attacked.  So based on 13.Qxb7 being played I'm still looking for a way to win material.
150,4,15,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/p3ppbp/6p1/1QnPp3/4P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Still trying to trap his Queen I add a defender to my Nc5 rather then retreating it to d7 which is something that I had also considered.
151,4,16,1f3,b'2rq1rk1/p3ppbp/6p1/1QnPp3/4P3/5P2/PP1N2PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This was played to give Jack solid pawn chain.  But that does not bother me since I'll now attack his Queen with the exact same move that Susan mentioned being 16...a6.  And that's where he prevents it from being trapped.  I am however still trying to figure out how to get material so that hasn't changed since a move can fail in more then one variation.
152,4,17,Qb6,b'2r2rk1/4ppbp/pq4p1/2nPp3/4P3/5P2/PP1NQ1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So I threaten a discovered check which unlike before Jack overlooks with his next move.
153,4,18,1b3,b'2r2rk1/4ppbp/pq4p1/2nPp3/4P3/1P3P2/P2NQ1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',?? As best would've been 18.Kh1 where the monarch is in the corner which is the safe spot as I previously learned from him.  My guess is that the glaucoma got the best of him.  But with this move I'm going to get a pawn and Rook.  Winning the R is what I was really hoping for when I said that I'm still trying to figure out a way to win material.  Yes that's what I was alluding to which has now become a reality.
154,4,19,1Nxb3+,b'2r2rk1/4ppbp/pq4p1/3Pp3/4P3/1n3P2/P2NQ1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"Jack: Oh I forgot the King.  Joe: Almost missed it.  Jack: You might win the game then.  Now I said almost overlooked because of a variation before playing ...Nxb3+.  What I almost forgot is that it's check.  It was a minor episode of Ghost Vision which got corrected right away which is how I saw this sequence.  But as we're about to see ""It's not over til it's over""  As now getting overly confident is really about to show."
155,4,20,2Ba3,b'2r2rk1/4ppbp/pq4p1/3Pp3/4P3/B4P2/P2NQ1PP/n4R1K b - -',Jack completes his development.  This is where I get carried away as that's all I thought he wanted.  But it's not the entire story that the board was trying to tell me.  I was worried about him getting a piece which was either going to be that or getting a pawn.
156,4,21,2Rc3,b'5rk1/4ppbp/pq4p1/3Pp3/4P3/B1r2P2/P2NQ1PP/n4R1K w - -',With that being said my attitude is that he cannot have that piece because if Jack takes I'll take back.  This is no mistake since both can be corrected but the attitude (thought process) is wrong on so many levels.  Once he takes the pawn I'm going to start getting into trouble.
157,4,22,Re8,b'4r1k1/4Bpbp/pq4p1/3Pp3/4P3/2r2P2/P2NQ1PP/n4R1K w - -',As now I'm interested in tempo gain.  I'm hoping for an exchange since I'm ahead.  Or that he would retreat his Be7 which would allow me to defend with 21...Nc2 which is what I thought would happen.  But none of that occurred.  Instead Jack played...
158,4,23,2d6,b'4r1k1/4Bpbp/pq1P2p1/4p3/4P3/2r2P2/P2NQ1PP/n4R1K b - -',This move which took me off guard.  I might be up but his passed pawn is dangerous.  And if I get my N out he advances it one square further.
159,4,24,2Qc6,b'4r1k1/4Bpbp/p1qP2p1/4p3/4P3/2r2P2/P2NQ1PP/n4R1K w - -',So I put a temporary stop to it which gives him a piece back as now it's almost level again.
160,4,25,Rc8,b'2r3k1/4Bpbp/p1qP2p1/4p3/4P3/2r2P2/P2NQ1PP/R6K w - -',So I threaten mate and try to get his other R.
161,4,26,2h3,b'2r3k1/4Bpbp/p1qP2p1/4p3/4P3/2r2P1P/P2NQ1P1/R6K b - -',Opening up.  Realizing I can't mate him I did not play 24.Rc1 but instead try to tie his N down with 24...Rc2.  Better was still 24...Rc1+ Even though I can't mate him I have three attackers against one defender so checking him by bringing the Rook to c1 would've won his other Rook.  But I was worried about what happens after that which is an eventual d7 followed by the promotion but even after that variation I'm still a R up and have just liquidated the promoted pawn afterwards.
162,4,27,2Qd3,b'2r3k1/4Bpbp/p1qP2p1/4p3/4P3/3Q1P1P/P1rN2P1/R6K b - -',He attacks my Rook.  But 25...Rc1+ is still possible and ought to have been played.  Instead I get an unrealistic attitude of trying to win his Be7 with my next move.  It turns out that according to what Jack implied 25...Bf8?? is the losing blunder as he'll be able to promote and get the R back.  I don't agree with it because after the variations which is still lost I would've played on and tried to get a draw.  So as per ION's advice he is my opponent and thus do not trust him.  But I agree that bringing the B to f8 is a mistake as he'll equalize but it was almost even so I deem it to be a small inaccuracy as opposed to the fatal mistake.
163,4,28,Rc1+,b'2r2bk1/3PBp1p/p1q3p1/4p3/4P3/3Q1P1P/P2N2P1/R1r4K w - -',As now I deliver check and trade off Rooks figuring that this was the only way out of trouble.  First it's too little too late as he gets the other Rook.  Second as noted it's still more or less even after the promotion which is something that miscounted figuring it was lost as he said in the end.
164,4,29,Bxe7,b'2r3k1/3Pbp1p/p5p1/4p3/4P3/3Q1P1P/P2N2PK/2q5 w - -',With that being said I cannot offer a draw as Jack will decline the offer.  But I try to trick him into a variation that might lead to a draw by repetition by exchanging B's.  Besides if I didn't take he surely would have a winning advantage as he'd be a piece up since that B was goner anyhow.  At least I get compensation in return.
165,4,30,3Nc4,b'2q3k1/4bp1p/p5p1/4p3/2N1P3/3Q1P1P/P5PK/8 b - -',After the promotion he attacks my pawn which I defend with my next move.  I also considered 30...Qe6 but 30...f5 was played to get a pawn chain.  What I didn't realize is that this chain is ineffective since it does not include passed pawns.  From experience I've learned that passed pawns are in general only effective when one of them is a passer.
166,4,31,3Qd5+,b'2q3k1/4b2p/p5p1/3Qpp2/2N1P3/5P1P/P5PK/8 b - -',Not to my surprise Jack checks but figuring it was just a nuicanse (since I don't see an immediate win of material I get out with my next move.)  But like with Ken I should've checked out the variations because I'm now in serious trouble which I didn't realize until the end.
167,4,32,3Kf8,b'2q2k2/4b2p/p5p1/3Qpp2/2N1P3/5P1P/P5PK/8 w - -',I had initially played 31...Kf7 figuring that it would get me out of a more difficult situation.  But contrary to my game against Loyd and a different game where he mated Jack accurately pointed out that it was an illegal move to his Q being on the same diagonal.  The reason I forgot was Ghost Vision since it appeared to be on black square when the Queen was on the white square leaving it on that diagonal.  But his next move is still the same regardless.
168,4,33,3Nxe5,b'2q2k2/4b2p/p5p1/3QNp2/4P3/5P1P/P5PK/8 b - -',As I saw this coming but this is where I got overly confident figuring that it was the best that Jack could do so.  In fact I became happy figuring that I just might have a drawn.  Although not resignable (not a position where I'd resign as I feel that there's more to learn it's technically a lost position) as I'll explain with the variations that Jack and I played through.
169,4,34,3f4,b'2q2k2/4b2p/p5p1/3QN3/4Pp2/5P1P/P5PK/8 w - -',"?? In fact after taking another look I figured that Jack might have made another blunder as I was believe it or not trying to plan a mating sequence but missed the very basic rule that bhidragon taught of is my monarch attacked and can I get mated.  In fact during that game bhidragon asked me how I could miss a back rank.  Well this isn't a backrank mate but it's as easy to stop and thus I shouldn't be missing something like this.  But the reason is the same as I talked about attacking lines and having an overwhelming attack which I thought might happen here.  So what he said ""You forgot the first and most basic rule ... is the King under attack!  A brilliant move that opens an attacking line is worth nothing if you get mated."" Similarly I forgot the same basic rule and for the same reason.  So likewise I felt that black might have an overwhelming attack here.  I was planning a mate and assumed that I might have some overwhelming attacking forces with Jack just like my rated game with bhidragon so yes I had gained some intelligence from that game but it was too much for my own good.  With the pawn on f4 now I was thinking along the lines 33...Bh4 followed by 34...Qg5 and then 35...Qg3+ as I thought it was mate but realize that he could answer with 36.Kg1  At the time though I thought that 35...Qg3+ was mate.  But what I missed is that this attitude is going to get me mated.  So we studied variations and Jack's correct that best was either 32...Ke8 or 32...Kg7  After 32...Kg7 he has 33.Qf7+ but that loses my B.  The variation however we played through was 32...Ke8 but then comes 33.Qf7+ Kd8 (forced) and after 34.Qg8+ the Bishop is also goner.  So it's still a lost position but I would've played on.  With this move it's over at once with the mate that I had overlooked."
170,4,35,3Qf7#,b'2q2k2/4bQ1p/p5p1/4N3/4Pp2/5P1P/P5PK/8 b - -',After this Jack told what I did wrong and I agree but at a later phase as it is how I lost.  So the moral of the story is don't get so comfortable in the endgame especially when you're a piece up and under pressure which is what happened.  In it he said that I went wrong by allowing him to get back his Rook which implies that 25...Bf8?! was the losing blunder for had 25...Rc1+ at once it wouldn't have happened.  But the decisive blow however was 32...f4?? which is what allowed the mate.  Had I defended accurately he would've won the piece but contrary to what he said I might have still had a chance to get a draw and thus would not have resigned.  But the moral is still the same as it was the way I was thinking and thus led to becoming too comfortable and thus overly confident.

246,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Like me he starts with the King's Pawn Opening.
247,7,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I'm used to seeing this but likewise I'm used to this becoming the KG.  In fact what made me interested in playing that unusual was the first one I studied from the same person.  So it's of no surprise that he plays and similarly black accepts the gambit.
248,7,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',More common is 3.Nf3 as that's the mainline.  But similar to what Ken emphasized Joe will deviate from the mainlines in part to make his opponent feel that he has gotten advantage.  It often leads to letting your guard down and making mistakes that would cost you the game as it did here.
249,7,3,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is what reversion played against me when I similarly didn't play 3.Nf3.  That check lost fairly quickly but right now the position here is about equal and black is the one that needs to be careful as we're about to see.  Another problem here is that despite this check black's Q is out early since none of his pieces are developed.  This will put him at a disadvantage later on.
250,7,4,Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq -',Similar to Joe he starts developing.  But with the Queen in a bad spot Joe will harass kavayah1's pieces while developing which will enable him to develop further leaving black way behind in that and center control.  So we're already starting to see a noticeable space advantage from Joe.
251,7,5,Bxf7+,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1Bpp/1b6/8/3PPpq1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',This is a nasty check that starts giving Joe a winning advantage as other's pointed out.  In part it's because of black's inability to castle which is worse then white inability to do so as the monarch will be exposed here.  Also worth noting that black cannot take back as Joe said.  As that would lose the Queen immediately with the tactical motif 8.Ne5+ since it forks in a nasty way.  So even with best play white is winning.
252,7,6,h3,b'rnb2knr/pppp1Bpp/1b6/8/3PPpq1/5N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQ1K1R b - -',With that being said Joe continues to harass black's Queen which will allow him even further development.
253,7,7,Kxf7,b'rnb3nr/pppp1kpp/1b6/8/3PPp2/2N2NqP/PPP3P1/R1BQ1K1R w - -',?! Now black take advantage to grab the piece.  In my opinion this is another inaccuracy because at the very least Joe will continue harassing the Queen which would at the very least allow him to complete his development.  Whereas black only remains with one piece developed leaving him with no center control.  Plus his monarch is in rough shape where it remains exposed.
254,7,8,Nf6,b'rnb4r/pppp1kpp/1b3n2/8/3PPp2/5NqP/PPP1N1P1/R1BQ1K1R w - -',?? It's possible that this was lost but I view as the official losing blunder from black.  My guess is that he wanted to continue with his development rather then waste it moving the Queen back.  But that was the least of his problems since this loses the Queen for a piece.
255,7,9,1Qd3,b'rnb4r/pppp1kpp/1b3n2/8/3PP3/3Q1NpP/PPP3P1/R1B2K1R b - -',Which enables Joe to use his Queen as an attacking force.

257,7,11,Nh5,b'rnb4r/ppp2kpp/1b1p4/4P2n/3P4/3Q1NpP/PPP3P1/R1B2K1R w - -',Rather then losing the N right away through an exchange he retreats.  But Joe has some nasty surprises for him.  
258,7,12,Be6,b'rn5r/ppp2kpp/1b1pb3/4P2n/2QP4/5NpP/PPP3P1/R1B2K1R w - -',?? Trying to harass white's Queen.  Although black was lost this is the move that loses right away.  I'm not sure what the best move was but Joe said that this was the biggest blunder of the entire game.  If black doesn't make any blunder so with best it's a mate in 9 for him because of this move.  That's based on what Komodo said.
259,7,13,Kf8,b'rn3k1r/ppp3pp/1b1pb3/4P1Nn/2QP4/6pP/PPP3P1/R1B2K1R w - -',?? Better was 15...Kg6 as there's still a small way to go.  But by playing this on top of getting another piece Joe forces an immediate mate in two.
260,7,14,1Nxh7#,b'rn3kr1/ppp3pN/1b1pQ3/4P2n/3P4/6pP/PPP3P1/R1B2K1R b - -',I find this game to be very instructive for novices.  It comes to show the importance of some of the guidelines.  Mainly developing your pieces controlling the center and getting the monarch to safety.  Black failed to do all of this by bringing his Queen out before developing which enabled Joe to constantly harass and later win the Queen.  From there it was all going downhill until mate was forced since TA was able to use that time to build attacking forces against black's monarch with his pieces.  That became overwhelming and eventually led to this mate.

White's e4 pawn in particular completely locks down my e-pawn my dark-squared bishop and takes the f5 square away from my other bishop. If I'm going to do anything this game it has to go. And since I don't want to move my f-pawn that means attacking white's d-pawn first. 
267,8,6,b3,b'rnbqk1nr/p4pbp/2pp2p1/1p1Pp3/2P1P3/1P2B2P/P4PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White declines to trade pawns twice. If I play cxd5 or bxc4 he simply retakes and his center pawns are as safe as ever. While it would open up the queenside his bishops are better placed to take advantage of that than mine.

If white reacts poorly black can play Nxf2 threatening the h1 rook and unmasking the bishop for a discovered attack onto white's queen. The queen's movement options are also severely limited the only space she can safely move to is Qd1. (c1 and b2 are unavailable because of Nd3+.)

With his queen off the board his dark-squared bishop becomes his only developed piece and none of the others (particularly that h1 rook he decided to save) can reach active positions any time soon. 
279,8,18,1gxf5,b'r2qk2r/p4pbp/2pp4/2nPpp2/1BP5/1P4nP/P4PP1/R3KBNR w KQkq -',? I was so eager to take the queen I missed Nxf5. It costs me the knight though the material advantage is decisive regardless.

289,8,28,O-O,b'r4rk1/p4p1p/2Pp4/5p2/2Pb4/1P4PP/P5P1/4B2K w - -',White finally resigned. Overall this was a fairly sloppy game. White made quite a few unforced errors and seemed to be playing on tilt after losing his queen. On my end I made some poor decisions in the opening and but my mistakes (missing 14... Nxf5 and 23. Re1 was bad) were overshadowed by white's blunders. That said I feel the positional play early-mid game around white's pawn structure was interesting enough to be worth annotating hopefully you found it entertaining. 
290,9,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',A solid way for white to proceed. In this opening white is advised not to move the c pawn. This is very counterintuitive (c4 looks soooo tempting!) but in fact it just helps black in developement with accurate play (and at club levels). White has Bb5+ as his more aggressive try and I fear it a little. f6 would be my response.

If any minor piece interposes dxe6 is a proper ""dark hole"". So c6 must be the answer and... it's another story. I test my opponents here: if they don't play Bb5+ they either don't know the opening or they are going for slow routine passive play. I will catch those... ;-) "

295,9,5,c6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is a more positional approach. It 1) restricts the b5 threat 2) opens the way for the BQ to b6 or c7 - her's optimal square. Bc5 instead allows d4 with tempo but I think it's playable (my B will go to b4 exchange the N and then with Ne4 attacking c3 I'll have won some games. The key of my attack is to align Bd6 and Qc7 on white's castled K. But I can wait for the white's d pawn to be moved to play Bd6 and in the meantime I try to get the most of my tempoes. I also know that Ng5 or Bg5 will become an annoyance I have to be aware all the time. And I know I'll castle queenside and that I will launch a pawn's storm on g. This is what I'll say if I'll see this position because I play it a lot. Of course it must have some problem somewhere. I just wonder how high the rate must be in order to meet it. 
296,9,6,Nf3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Normal and I can't prevent it.

My K is near to be exposed but not for some moves. I'll use these.

The reason for this is because a check can possibly be made (Re8+) if white doesn't close up the hole. This also means white can't castle until it leaves check stalling a good defensive position for at least a turn.

White can't castle out of check his only moves being Ne5 Ne3/Ne7+ Qe2 or Be3; most of which either wastes a piece a turn or both. The best choice here would be Be3 as it is the only move that wastes neither and it develops his bishop.

Bd2 isn't much better as that undevelops the e-file blockade i made him carry out earlier. Nd2 is the best move in this position.

My remaining knight still has ampoule protection as well as any pieces he would hope to take on the 8-rank. His own pawn blocks access to the left side of the table and my bishop on d6 keeps it that way.
595,17,21,1Nc3,b'r1b1r1k1/p4ppp/3b4/q2P4/PpQ5/2n1B3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',My knight can now force white's king into the corner. Ponder Ne2+. White's only move in that case would be Kh1. This is a bad place for the king to be in because it's smothered behind its own pieces; any pieces capturing on h2 or g2 will render a checkmate if backed up by a single piece.
596,17,22,2Kh1,b'r1b1r1k1/p4ppp/2Qb4/q2P4/Pp6/4B3/4nPPP/R4R1K b - -',The scenario previously mentioned has been fulfilled.

White has few choices at this point and movement of either rook to attack my knight will only make things worse as Bg4 easily protects its position. White can't afford to lose any more material. Opening up his pawns might delay his downfall but not for long.
598,17,24,Bg4,b'r2qr1k1/p4ppp/2Qb4/3P4/Pp4b1/4B3/4nPPP/R3R2K w - -',Though the bishop can be attacked by a pawn it's no longer a good move. h3 would only allow for Qh4 which puts white in a very bad position and an immediate mate is possible if white plays g3 right after (Qxh3#). f3/f4 isn't good either because it lets the rook on the e-file take white's remaining bishop without consequence (Rxe3). Regardless the bishop can be force-taken (Rxe3) resulting in some nasty checkmate possibilities.

645,18,41,Qa6,b'8/7r/q7/3PQ3/3RPpPk/5P1n/P6P/5R1K w - -',Wham!! A shocking move by black which threatens mate-in-one but ALSO threatens the isolated pawn on the side of the board. What will white do about this?
646,18,42,3Rd2,b'8/7r/q7/3PQ3/4PpPk/5P1n/P2R3P/5R1K b - -',Protects the pawn... Very wise. That rook can take care of himself.

648,18,44,3Qb2,b'8/8/q6r/3P4/4PpPk/5P1n/PQ1R3P/5R1K b - -',Here white makes DOUBLE-SURE that that pawn is guaranteed-damn-protected. There is absolutely no way he is going to let this guy come in and smash another one of his pawns all up to hell! Absolutely no damn way. And I applaud him for it.

To quote the Wikipedia article I have just referred to ""unpinning the knight is a move that is common among amateurs who have no theoretical knowledge when they face the Nimzo-Indian. Although the move is not bad it is unambitious. The strategic aim of obtaining the bishop pair without conceding the doubled pawns fails for after e.g. 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4 White does not get to keep both bishops and fair trades are usually not in White's interests since White has an advantage in space."""
661,20,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',This seems a sensible move by black.

To answer my friend's question ""Be interesting to know if you think I played particularly well or if my opponent made major blunders."" Yes I think black did make major blunders in the opening and white played skillfully to take advantage of them to become a clear pawn up. I think black was too much of a hurry to exchange minor pieces with 17. Bxa6 after which it became harder to convert the extra pawn. In the endgame black played skillfully to avoid defeat.

What I should have played was David Bronstein's queen sacrifice 7...Nh5 8.Qd2 Qh4+ 9.g3 Nxg3 10.Qf2 Nxf1 11.Qxh4 Nxe3 where Black has given up the queen for two bishops and a pawn and will also win a second pawn after 12...Nxc4. In return for the material Black obtains a solid and compact position devoid of weaknesses the safer king and control over the dark squares. Cherniaev and Prokuronov were sceptical of whether Black had sufficient compensation after 12.Qf2 but the line is very dangerous if White plays nonchalantly. Also my opponent obviously knew this variation better than me so perhaps it would have been hard for me to convert! But now I am at a disadvantage in that my opponent knows this variation better than me. I had to think while my opponent continued to play very quickly.

I didn't fancy playing on the exchange and two pawns down against a player of his quality so I resigned.

804,23,3,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It is more usual to develop the Bc1 to g5 - that is what I do as white - but this is perfectly playable.
805,23,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Natural development.

807,23,6,dxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black has wisely waited until white has moved the Bf1 before taking on c4.

810,23,9,b5,b'rnbq1rk1/2p1bppp/p3pn2/1p6/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - b6',So black expands.

820,23,19,1Bxd1,b'rn4k1/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BB2K1 b - -',White takes back.
821,23,20,1Nc6,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p1n1pn2/1pb5/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BB2K1 w - -',Black develops the last minor piece. Black has a very small advantage here due to better development and a slight space advantage on the queen side.
822,23,21,1a3,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p1n1pn2/1pb5/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BB2K1 b - -',White prevents further advance of the b pawn.
823,23,22,1Bd6,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p1nbpn2/1p6/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BB2K1 w - -',I have the Gameknot computer analysis and neither side makes any mistake in this game according to it.  This looks wrong to me I would have thought the natural move would be to seize the open file with the rook or to centralise the king. I therefore set up this position on Fritz. Fritz does like this move.
824,23,23,1b4,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p1nbpn2/1p6/1P6/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BB2K1 b - b3',Black's spacial advantage on the queen side is no more.
825,23,24,1Ne5,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p2bpn2/1p2n3/1P6/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BB2K1 w - -',Looking for more exchanges. An impression I am getting is that neither player is particularly ambitious in this game - both seem happy to trade pieces and head towards a draw.
826,23,25,1Nxe5,b'r5k1/1b3ppp/p2bpn2/1p2N3/1P6/P1N1P3/5PPP/R1BB2K1 b - -',So the knight comes off.

831,23,30,1Kf8,b'2r2k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1p2b3/1P6/P1N1P3/1B3PPP/2RB2K1 w - -',King is centralised.

835,23,34,2Rd8,b'3r1k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P3P2/P1R1P3/1B4PP/3B2K1 w - -',Black wisely avoids the exchange for once.
836,23,35,2Rc1,b'3r1k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/1B4PP/2RB2K1 b - -',Fritz prefers Bb3 here.
837,23,36,2Rd2,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/1B1r2PP/2RB2K1 w - -',Black takes control of the white's 2nd rank attacking g2 and b2.
838,23,37,2Bxf6,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p3pB2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/3r2PP/2RB2K1 b - -',Black is wise to do this capture.
839,23,38,2Rxg2+,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p3pB2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6rP/2RB2K1 w - -',Black takes with check before recapturing.
840,23,39,2Kf1,b'5k2/1b3ppp/p3pB2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6rP/2RB1K2 b - -',If Kh1?? Black can mate with R to g3 g4 g5 or g6!
841,23,40,2gxf6,b'5k2/1b3p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6rP/2RB1K2 w - -',Now black takes back. Although black is a pawn up it is doubled and hard to convert to a win.
842,23,41,2Rc8+,b'2R2k2/1b3p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6rP/3B1K2 b - -',This is an interesting move offering the exchange of rooks in an unusual way.
843,23,42,2Bxc8,b'2b2k2/5p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6rP/3B1K2 w - -',Which black accepts.
844,23,43,2Kxg2,b'2b2k2/5p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6KP/3B4 b - -',and white takes back.
845,23,44,2Bb7+,b'5k2/1b3p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/6KP/3B4 w - -',Black throws in a check.
846,23,45,2Kf2,b'5k2/1b3p1p/p3pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/5K1P/3B4 b - -',and white wisely avoids the bishop exchange. With bishops on it is harder for black to win.
847,23,46,2Bc6,b'5k2/5p1p/p1b1pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/5K1P/3B4 w - -',Presumably to prevent a3-a4 and a pawn exchange on b5.
848,23,47,2Bc2,b'5k2/5p1p/p1b1pp2/1p6/1P3P2/P3P3/2B2K1P/8 b - -',white hits the pawn on h7.
849,23,48,2f5,b'5k2/5p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P3P3/2B2K1P/8 w - -',Black blocks the attack.
850,23,49,2Ke2,b'5k2/5p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P3P3/2B1K2P/8 b - -',White centralises his king more.
851,23,50,2Ke7,b'8/4kp1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P3P3/2B1K2P/8 w - -',Black's king follows him across.
852,23,51,3Kd2,b'8/4kp1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P3P3/2BK3P/8 b - -',White moves the king over again avoiding Kd3? Be4+
853,23,52,3Kd7,b'8/3k1p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P3P3/2BK3P/8 w - -',Not sure why black picked this square rather than d6.
854,23,53,3Kc3,b'8/3k1p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P1K1P3/2B4P/8 b - -',King is heading for the centre.
855,23,54,3Kc7,b'8/2k2p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P3P2/P1K1P3/2B4P/8 w - -',I'm not sure what black is trying to do.
856,23,55,3Kd4,b'8/2k2p1p/p1b1p3/1p3p2/1P1K1P2/P3P3/2B4P/8 b - -',King comes up into he centre.
857,23,56,3Kd6,b'8/5p1p/p1bkp3/1p3p2/1P1K1P2/P3P3/2B4P/8 w - -',and the black king comes up to meet him.
858,23,57,3Bd3,b'8/5p1p/p1bkp3/1p3p2/1P1K1P2/P2BP3/7P/8 b - -',and the white king refuses to give way.
859,23,58,3f6,b'8/7p/p1bkpp2/1p3p2/1P1K1P2/P2BP3/7P/8 w - -',so black tries the only way possible.
860,23,59,3h4,b'8/7p/p1bkpp2/1p3p2/1P1K1P1P/P2BP3/8/8 b - h3',refusing to move the king again.
861,23,60,3Bb7,b'8/1b5p/p2kpp2/1p3p2/1P1K1P1P/P2BP3/8/8 w - -',not sure of the point of this either.
862,23,61,3Bc2,b'8/1b5p/p2kpp2/1p3p2/1P1K1P1P/P3P3/2B5/8 b - -',White of course is happy to mark time.
863,23,62,3e5+,b'8/1b5p/p2k1p2/1p2pp2/1P1K1P1P/P3P3/2B5/8 w - -',Black finally comes up with the pawn advance.
864,23,63,3Kc3,b'8/1b5p/p2k1p2/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/P1K1P3/2B5/8 b - -',White extremely wises refuses to exchange and undouble black's pawns - which would clearly lose - and also refuses to retreat to d3 allowing Be4+ and the bishop exchange - which would also lose. White finds the one move to draw.
865,23,64,3Be4,b'8/7p/p2k1p2/1p2pp2/1P2bP1P/P1K1P3/2B5/8 w - -',Black offers the bishop exchange again.
866,23,65,3Bb3,b'8/7p/p2k1p2/1p2pp2/1P2bP1P/PBK1P3/8/8 b - -',White wisely avoids.
867,23,66,3Bc6,b'8/7p/p1bk1p2/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PBK1P3/8/8 w - -',Bishop drops back again.
868,23,67,3Kd2,b'8/7p/p1bk1p2/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PB2P3/3K4/8 b - -',not sure of the point of this - the king seemed perfectly placed on c3
869,23,68,3h6,b'8/8/p1bk1p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PB2P3/3K4/8 w - -',presumably h7-h8 is played to make sure it is safe from white's bishop.
870,23,69,3Bc2,b'8/8/p1bk1p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/P3P3/2BK4/8 b - -',White attacks f5.
871,23,70,3Ke6,b'8/8/p1b1kp1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/P3P3/2BK4/8 w - -',Black protects.
872,23,71,4Bb3+,b'8/8/p1b1kp1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PB2P3/3K4/8 b - -',White checks.
873,23,72,4Ke7,b'8/4k3/p1b2p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PB2P3/3K4/8 w - -',King retreats. Maybe Bd5 was a better winning attempt but it is hard for black to win.
874,23,73,4Kc3,b'8/4k3/p1b2p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PBK1P3/8/8 b - -',King returns.
875,23,74,4Kd7,b'8/3k4/p1b2p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PBK1P3/8/8 w - -',Another king move.
876,23,75,4Kd2,b'8/3k4/p1b2p1p/1p2pp2/1P3P1P/PB2P3/3K4/8 b - -',"King drops back and a draw agreed. 

My friend asked me ""Be interesting to know if you think I played particularly well or if my opponent made major blunders."" I think my considered reply would be - neither side made any major blunders. White played the opening slightly insipidly and dropped a pawn. It was always going to be hard to convert the pawn but white played extremely well from that point on and prevented black from converting.

So no developing move right now but any alternative was just a shot in the dark (Bd3 is ok but what for? h3 so to get a square for the B after Nd5? How boring! Let's be nasty! :-)

I did think very seriously here about taking on a3 and then castling but I was a bit afraid of him developing something on the kingside with something like moving his Nf3 followed by Qg4.

990,28,5,Nd7,b'r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And Sue develops in an interesting manner.  It would normally be an inaccuracy since the N is cramped.  But in this case it's a very solid move by black.  First no good was obviously 4...Na6 and for the obvious reason.  But more importantly however was 4...Nc6 which normally be perhaps the best move.  That however isn't so here because white played 1.d4 as opposed to 1.e4  And in 1.d4 openings the N should not block the c file until the pawn has advanced.  Now after the lesson with bhidragon on figuring out what the board was trying to tell me and not getting fixated on principles I regarded it as irrelevant in one of charleshiggie's annotation.  But in that instance I misinterpreted.  As the board was telling something for that was the losing blunder especially when black brought his N back to c6 without advancing the pawn.  It was later on that I found out that the c pawn was needed and in blocking it off charleshiggie had an advantage which he exploited and forced the win.  
991,28,6,e3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Like with the Colle's System London System or KID this is also common.  In part we have a pawn chain but more importantly as with black there are good placed for his Bf1.

994,28,9,Ndf6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?! As she has brought her N to a better outpost.  But better was 6...Ngf6 as castling is now an option.  Though black is allright white now has a space advantage with the gain of tempo.  That's because she'll have to move it back to in order to bring her other N to that square later when she could've brought it there at once.

I would've castled with 7.0-0 but have no problem with this move because his center is now opened up which gives white a lead in center control.  With that being said white will castle on his next move.
996,28,11,Nd7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nppbp/6p1/2p5/2P5/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Her intention is to develop her other N to that square with the idea of castling.  But as noted it should've been left there as 6...Ngf6 would've been possible right then and there.
997,28,12,Qe2,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nppbp/6p1/2p5/2P5/2NBPN2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Not needing to worry about the DSB Ken brings his Queen out at once.  I'm not sure what's happening now but it is going to become pretty dangerous later on.  That's especially because of the move that Sue will play at once with her next move.
998,28,13,1h3,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nppbp/5np1/2p5/2P5/2NBPN1P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I wouldn't have even considered this move because it advances a pawn right near the K with no apparent reason.  But I can see why as it was to prevent 10...Ng4.   However there's more to this as meets the eye as white now has a dangerous plan against black.  It wasn't obvious to me but I'll see the plan later on which is why this move plays an important role as Sue must be very careful here.  Even slight inaccuracies can cost her the game here.
999,28,14,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/5np1/2p5/2P5/2NBPN1P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Meanwhile like with Ken Sue gets her monarch to safety at once.
1000,28,15,1e4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/5np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',At first I wondered why Ken played this.  But he has a dangerous plan not just against the N but against black's pawn.  Now even more then before caution is essential.
1001,28,16,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/1p3np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Which Sue doesn't see and it's her first error.  By that I don't just mean inaccuracy but it's a mistake.  As now Sue will have to misplace her Knight on the rim to save her piece.  I'd normally just call it an inaccuracy but a very similar position happened with tactical-abyss where he once again went out of book early and won.  I even think it was a Q sac but if not it was one of the others that I annotated where he moves his N out and then back to the original post rather then following development.  But one of the big mistakes from his opponent however was placing the N on the rim.  From there Joe just left it there as it kept losing value until the opponent faced ruinous loss of material which he resigned.  And now a similar pattern will happen with Sue if she defends accurately.  Thus best was 11...Ne5 to prevent what Ken is about to do.  Worth noting was that seeing this line 10.h3 was played keeping in mind that 11...Ng4?? is no longer an option.
1002,28,17,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/p2nppbp/1p4p1/2p1P3/2P5/2NB1N1P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? So she moved it back here.  But in doing so Sue will lose material with white's next move as 13...Rb8 is forced to prevent the immediate loss of a piece.  However she will still go down a piece in a couple of moves afterwards which will give Ken a winning advantage at this point.  So best as noted above was 12...Nh5.
1003,28,18,1Rd1,b'1rbqnrk1/p2nppbp/1p4p1/2p1P3/2P1B3/2N2N1P/PP2QPP1/R1BR2K1 b - -',As this does more then just centralize his Rook.  That's because black's Nd7 is indirectly pinned with this move.  And in doing so he will add another attacker which is how white is about to win a piece for a pawn.  That's because 14...Bxe5 is forced which gives white the piece.  But if she doesn't take on e5 15.Bc6 gives white a free piece.
1004,28,19,Ng7,b'1rbq1rk1/p2nppnp/1p4p1/2p1N3/2P1B3/2N4P/PP2QPP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',Redeploying her N but Ken forces another exchanges which will tie down black's Bc8.

As now not only is her Bd7 pinned but there is another attacker to it which leaves it trapped.  Now if black doesn't take 18.Bxc6 is another free piece.  When she does take however black gets a Queen for a Rook and pawn.  Therefore she's in just as much trouble.  Either way white is lost here.  However I think she does the right thing by not resigning yet as there is still more to learn similar to my first game against him.
1006,28,21,Rde8,b'1r2r1k1/p3Qpnp/1pb3p1/2p5/2P5/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1B3K1 w - -',Trying for counterplay Sue attacks the Queen.  And not to my surprise not only does Ken protect but he goes after her B which she then is forced to protect.

1008,28,23,2Kf8,b'1r2rk2/pbQ2pnp/1p4pB/2p5/2P5/2N4P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - -',I do not know why she played this as 22.Qxf7+?? would not work out for white.  I believe that Sue was worried about which I was back then.  But Ken doesn't have a Rook near it yet leaving black with an attacker against a defender.
1009,28,24,2Rd1,b'1r2rk2/pbQ2pnp/1p4pB/2p5/2P5/2N4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',Not to my surprise this was played as Ken is about to bring another attacker.
1010,28,25,2Kg8,b'1r2r1k1/pbQ2pnp/1p4pB/2p5/2P5/2N4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',I can understand this move as it appears to be mate after something 23.Rd7 followed by 24.Rxf7+ at the very least winning another piece since after 25.Rxg7 black cannot take back as it would be an illegal move.  But with this move white further liquidates.  Therefore I would've 22...Rbd8 with idea of Hope Chess.  I'd be hoping that white wouldn't see the opportunity.  With the idea that maybe you exchange N's and then mate with 23...Rxd8+ with the idea of 24.Rxd8 Qxd8# which would win a lost game.  But I'd come to the realization that this wouldn't work since white would exchange with 23.Rxd8 first and then exchange N's with the same effects.  But in this position I can't think of anything better then Hope Chess since white is busted because I wouldn't be ready to resign yet since there still appears to be more to learn.  
1011,28,26,2Rd7,b'1r2r3/pbQR1pkp/1p4p1/2p5/2P5/2N4P/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',Now only that but Ken is trying to threaten mate.

1013,28,28,2Nb5,b'1r3r2/pbQR1pkp/1p4p1/1Np5/2P5/7P/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',So Ken adds another attacker.

1016,28,31,2Kf6,b'1r3r2/1bQR1p1p/pp1N1kp1/2p5/2P5/7P/PP3PP1/6K1 w - -',Not sure of what's going on Sue moves the K as it is attacked.  But 26.Nd6 was more damaging then one could ever imagine as we're about to see since he's going to win another pawn and piece.
1017,28,32,g5,b'1r6/1N3Q1p/pp6/2p1k1p1/2P5/7P/PP3PP1/6K1 w - -',As black I would resign here as now I'd feel that there's nothing else left to learn since Sue is too far down.  But I can understand her intentions to stay in since I used to believe and thus would not resign until mate was forced which will happen here.
1018,28,33,3Qb2#,b'8/7p/pp6/6p1/1pN5/7P/kQ3PP1/6K1 b - -',"The moral of this game is something that I learned from chesskingdom64 which I used to annotate a couple of games.  But it applies here Sue and remembering this will help you to become a better player since I have problems with this myself.  Well first is to be prepared for common openings like this.  What goes into it however as he said was ""The openings must be used with the greatest care.  What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the mid game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results.""  With that mistake in the opening Ken was able to tie down your pieces and thus win material which is what enabled white this win."

1082,30,44,2b4,b'r1b2k2/5ppq/1n1p1n2/2pPpPQ1/1p2P3/2N2B2/PP1K3P/R6R w - -',Continuing his attack. Fritz likes this too.

1086,30,48,2Ba6,b'r4k2/5ppq/b2p1n2/1NpPpPQ1/1pn1P3/5B2/PPK4P/R6R w - -',This seems to be a mistake it allows an unpleasant fork. Fritz prefers Bd7.
1087,30,49,2Nc7,b'r4k2/2N2ppq/b2p1n2/2pPpPQ1/1pn1P3/5B2/PPK4P/R6R b - -',This seemed a natural fork although Fritz prefers a2-a4.

1091,30,53,2Bxe4,b'r4k2/2N2pp1/b2p4/2pPpPQ1/1pn1B3/7q/PPK4P/5R1R b - -',So I just take the knight.

I get the feeling neither of us really understood what was going on given how rarely we picked what Fritz considers to be the best move!

1103,31,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So does he.
1104,31,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I pin the knight.

1107,31,9,h6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',By playing this now he reduces my options for instance if he plays 5....0-0 immediately I have 6. Qc2 and can meet 6....h6 with 7. h4?! with interesting complications (which don't necessarily favour white).
1108,31,10,Bh4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',So I drop the bishop back.

One is the world database of over-the-board games played by the top players and the other is the database of openings played by the best Gameknot players. This move 6....Nc6 is not even in the world database - and for good reasons. In this variation black usually plays at some time either c7-c6 strengthening the centre or c7-c5 contesting the centre. This rules out both these options for the time being.

His Be7 is his good bishop being on the opposite colour to his pawns on e6 and d5. Yet he invites me to exchange my good bishop for his bad bishop.

1117,31,19,1dxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppn/4p2p/8/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K -',This is another slight inaccuracy allowing my Bf1 to develop with tempo.
1118,31,20,1Bxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppn/4p2p/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b K -',So I take back.

Black has to be a bit careful about ending up in a French-type position - not necessarily because of the position itself but because it can be different to their usual games and they mayn't be aware of some of the traps

1176,32,7,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So black takes
1177,32,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And I develop.   5. ... dc 6. QxN cb 7. BxP gives white a much better version of a Danish set-up; the queen and knight are both out as well.
1178,32,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So black develops his knight
1179,32,10,cxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And I take now.   I don't know if the transposition 5. cd Nc6 6. Nf3 is really any different or if black has another fifth move to play
1180,32,11,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This or 6. ... e6 are the two most common moves here leading to different games
1181,32,12,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I develop the bishop with tempo
1182,32,13,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',And black retreats; this is often not a great square for the knight and in some games it can be undermined by a later a4-a5 push when maybe a7 or b7 end up as targets for a queen or bishop respectively
1183,32,14,Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/3P4/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The main line is 8. Bb5 here but this is the line I play.   It involves a pawn sac - usually temporary - for a bit of play.   8. Bb5 I think is safer but more drawish.
1184,32,15,dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/4p3/3P4/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So black takes
1185,32,16,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And I don't take when the queens come off and white's king is a bit open but play this move instead.
1186,32,17,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black moves his knight
1187,32,18,1Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',And I develop.   I'm not worried about losing the LSB as the queen will cover the same squares from b3 in the event of an exchange.
1188,32,19,1f6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2p1pp/1n3p2/n2Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Maybe slightly ahead of time - I think black usually transposes the 11th and 10th as played in this game.   This move holds the pawn but gives black light-squared weaknesses which a bishop or queen on b3 can try take advantage of.
1189,32,20,1Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2p1pp/1n3p2/n2Pp3/8/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',So I develop the bishop.   White often castles late in this opening; I'm not under any pressure at the moment and development is more important.   The bishop here is keeping an eye on b6 and a7 as per the earlier note
1190,32,21,1Nxb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2p1pp/1n3p2/3Pp3/8/1nN1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black exchanges now

This just gives black time to get out of trouble.   Instead 15. Rfc1 and black can't stop 16. Nb5 trapping the queen.   15. Rfc1 is + 6.5; this is just level.

1203,32,34,1a4,b'1k1r1b1r/pp2p1pp/1n1q1p2/1Q1Pp3/P7/4B3/1P1N1PPP/2R2RK1 b - a3',Instead I go for the tried and well not all-that-trusted method of flinging pawns

1206,32,37,1e6,b'1k1r1b1r/pp4pp/1n2pp2/3qp3/P7/4B3/1P1NQPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black gives his bishop a route to the game
1207,32,38,2a5,b'1k1r1b1r/pp4pp/1n2pp2/P2qp3/8/4B3/1P1NQPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',And I push...and simply hang a pawn.   I'm sure we've all been there on gameknot!
1208,32,39,2Nc8,b'1knr1b1r/pp4pp/4pp2/P2qp3/8/4B3/1P1NQPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',And I'm sure we've all missed obvious captures too!   Black retreats his knight which turns out to be a critical mistake.   The knight was providing shelter for the king.
1209,32,40,2Rfd1,b'1knr1b1r/pp4pp/4pp2/P2qp3/8/4B3/1P1NQPPP/2RR2K1 b - -',So I bring my last piece into the game
1210,32,41,2Qxa5,b'1knr1b1r/pp4pp/4pp2/q3p3/8/4B3/1P1NQPPP/2RR2K1 w - -',And black takes now.   I'm three pawns down - and Fritz scores it -0.3.   The compensation?   Lots of open files towards the black king.

1215,32,46,2Rab1,b'1knr1b1r/pp4pp/4pp2/4p3/8/4B3/1q1NQPPP/1RR3K1 b - -',I play this though.   I'd like to think in an OTB game I'd have played some moves differently!

1223,32,54,2Rb1,b'3r1b1r/p5pp/knQ1pp2/4p3/8/q3B3/3N1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Not quite how the knight on b6 usually ends up undermined in this opening!   With the queen on a2 (see note to the 24th move) this move wouldn't be possible and white would just be lost
1224,32,55,2Bb4,b'3r3r/p5pp/knQ1pp2/4p3/1b6/q3B3/3N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Here Fritz gives the amusing defence 28. ... Qb4 (or Qd6) 29. Ra1+ Qa3 30. Rb1 and a draw by repetition!   Black offers his queen to defend the knight and I can't take as I'm a rook and three pawns down already.
1225,32,56,2Bxb6,b'3r3r/p5pp/kBQ1pp2/4p3/1b6/q7/3N1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Again the only move - Fritz actually gives a slight plus now.

Qd3 forks queen and rook!) Kc7 33. BxB I've a strong attack.   33. ... Rb8 is a tricky reply however when I can't take the queen because my back rank is weak - 34. Ba5+ Rb6 35. Qa6! is the only way to keep the advantage.   Appropriately the a7 pawn is the weakness now - again as singled out in the opening even if at this stage that's just a pure coincidence.
1227,32,58,3Nc4,b'3r3r/6pp/kpQ1pp2/4p3/1bN5/q7/5PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Again the only follow-up - forking mate and the queen.   Here black has to admit the attack and give up his queen - 30. ... Qa5 31. NxQ BxN 32. Qxe6 and I've a queen for a rook bishop and two pawns and Fritz says I'm not losing though black would have plenty of opportunity to prove me wrong over the board.
1228,32,59,3Rd6,b'7r/6pp/kpQrpp2/4p3/1bN5/q7/5PPP/1R4K1 w - -',This unfortunately is a terminal mistake.

1230,32,61,3Qd3,b'7r/6pp/kpQNpp2/4p3/1b6/3q4/5PPP/1R4K1 w - -',This allows a similar mate to the one just described - black's only defence was to cover b7 by 31. ... Rb8 but I still win with 32. Qc4+ b5 33. Qc6+ Ka7 34. NxP+ RxN 35. QxR and the bishop is gone next and the win will be trivial

I feel like Qd3 was a better move as it set the queen on a diagonal with the Black king.  As a general tip when positioning power pieces put them in lines that naturally allow attacks either direct or discovered as it creates pressures and possibilities. Your pieces are generally more useful when they can attack than just being used for defense.

Sometimes it's better to build a coalition of strength through more pieces in play before delivering the final blow.  A key difference between junior and more advanced play is the willingness to let power build so you can deliver a more decisive blow rather than taking the first offering.

1271,33,35,3Kxe1,b'8/p1p4k/2pp3p/8/8/8/P1P4P/4K3 b - -',When you find yourself in these situations you need a game plan on how to secure victory.  White's pawns are all singletons so there is no support there.  Essentially Black gets their king to the middle of the board pushes the three pawns on the c and d files up and then leverages 3 on 1 attacks with the king to promote.  If White moves to block with their King the Black king can go scarf the h pawn and promote.  It is almost impossible to not win as Black here but you still have to execute.
1272,33,36,c5,b'8/p7/7p/2pp1k2/2p5/P1P1K3/7P/8 w - c6',I'm not certain if this is the best move or not but it hardly matters at this point.  c5 prevents White's king from coming into the d4 square and affords me enough flexibility that regardless of his next move I can start forcing a pawn to promotion.  Either I can attack with the King towards h2 or advance the pawn to d4 and it's all but finished...

Without knowing the best response I'm thinking of 2.d4 only because they say that after 1.e4 if black only advances a pawn one square it's generally best to play 2.d4 A perfect example would be in the Caro Kann where 1...c7 is played and white answers with that move.  Ken: 2.d4 is the most common move here and quire playable
1317,37,1,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Joe:  Now it's about what to do. My e4 pawn is attacked and there are a few ways to protect it. I think that the best move would be 3.Nc3 as this develops.  Ken: a very standard move  
1318,37,2,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Joe: That is an interesting move. I'm not exactly sure what to do here but am thinking of 4.Nf3 to continue with my development.  Ken: 4.Nf3 is a very reasonable and standard idea

But I remember Jack Stockel implying that in general you don't want the pin there. And he mentioned that the most and usually best way to get out of it is with the bishop. With that being said I think that I'm best off with 5.Bd2.  Ken: with a knight on f3 or f6 what Jack told you is right but it is wrong when the knight is on c3 or c6. think a bit more here  Joe: Yes he was alluding to the King's Knight. So I am thinking about bringing my Bf1 into play with the idea of castling. The only question is which square. I like the looks of Bd3 where there is an added defender to my e4.  Ken: that is a common way of playing here
1320,37,4,Ne7,b'rn1qk2r/pbppnppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Joe:  As with a different annotation I think castling is a good idea at once. One reason for playing Bd3 was to castle.  Ken: I don't see a better move
1321,37,5,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pbppnppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Joe: Now that you have castled I'm planning to complete my development with my Bc1. I'd love to play Bd2 but as you pointed out it's not a good move. I would also consider Bg5 with the idea of pinning your Ne7 which can be broken with ...f6 Therefore I like the looks of Be3 as both of the Bishops are together. But I think that best is Bf4 as the DSB appears to be better placed then any other square.  Ken: Here you have a wide range of reasonable moves. That's both good and bad for you. Great to have so many good choices but the sheer size of the move tree with all these branches can lead to confusion. That is why I chose this defense so that you will be forced to think for yourself because the database won't be much help. A lot of good plausible moves to choose from. It will come down to deciding which type of position makes you most comfortable.  Joe: That makes sense. The irony is that I don't even look at the database because unless you know why they suggest moves it won't help to listen to it as I learned with tactical-abyss. Yes it's what I like to do here. I am interested in Be3 don't know what happens afterwards.  Ken: It is a reasonable idea and we both will learn from working our way through the variations.  Joe: I was thinking along a variation but after the first lesson about exchanges combined with a mistake in the team game where I got a lucky in which you gave an example of when not to exchange I'm not so sure. I was thinking along the lines of 7.Be3 with the idea being 7...d5 8.exd5 But I'm not sure that exchanging is the right approach. Or possibly 7.Be3 c5 but I'm not comfortable along the line after that. What it boils down to is me trying to avoid the exchange.  I also considered moving my Nc3 but I want to complete development as opposed to moving the same piece twice.  Ken: sounds logical  Joe: Which one Nc3 or Be3.  I meant Be3 or Ne2.  Ken: both are logical. a matter of preference. Which p[osition do you like more?  Joe: I like Ne2 the best.
1322,37,6,f5,b'rn1q1rk1/pbppn1pp/1p2p3/5p2/1b1PP3/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - f6',Joe: I'd normally wait to take f5 in order to prevent exchanging. The problem is that you would get a free pawn because of your Bb7. So I believe that exf5 is my only option. The only other move that doesn't lose anything would expose my King badly after something like 8.e5?! which allows 8...Bxf3 as now I'm forced to recapture with the pawn right next to the monarch.  Ken: I agree e5 is bad but look a little more there are other plausible choices  Joe: I looked at another option which I don't like as well because this semi restricts my Bc1. It's Ng5 to add a defender to e4.  Ken: This is one other way try a bit more  Joe: It's 8.c3 which is not only an alternative to the problem but just might win a piece in a few moves. It's about what comes after that. I think that c3 is the way to go here.  Looking into it I don't but it prevents the loss of material so it boils down to the best move. I think that the attack is solid.  Ken: now that you studied all the options take a bit more time and decide the one you like the best. This is the point here in playing such a flexible defense. I have given you a lot to have to think about.  Joe: You have and there is one other option that I missed being a3 with the same idea as c3 but it creates a semi open file for my Rook. I'll have to study all of them and will have a difficult time deciding which is best.  Ken: That is the one of the reasonsthis type of defense works. It overloads the opponent with a lot of appetizing choices and even at this slow speed it can be overwhelming.  Joe: I agree with you. I've limited it down to two or three choices. One thing for sure is that I need to be very careful here.  But I think I've figured it out here.  
1323,37,7,fxe4,b'rn1q1rk1/pbppn1pp/1p2p3/8/1b1Pp3/P2B1N2/1PP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Joe: I figured that you'd played this. I think that axb4 is the best option as it prevents the loss of a piece. Aside from that I don't see any good alternatives.  Ken: check a little more about the order of the moves and yes you absolutely must not come out of this a piece down.  Joe: I can also play 8...fxe3 with the idea of 9.Bxe4 Bxe4 10.axb4 I think that's better as not only haven't I've blundered a piece but my King is a lot safer since I'm not forced to capture with the g pawn that way.  Ken: Your most recent chat(note) is kiond of garbled. I think you mean that I can plaY fxe3 not you. But either way recheck your variation out to at least move 11.  Joe: I was thinking along the lines of 9.Bxe4 Bxe4 10.axb4 but after 10...Bxf3 I'm in rough shape as I'm forced to expose my K in order to prevent the loss of a piece. So it appears that the only move which does any better would be 9.Bxe4 but after 9...Bxe4 10.axb4 Bxf3 I'm still in rough shape for the same reason. So there's no way to prevent the K exposure as those are the only ways to avoid coming out a piece down.  So I'm in bad shape either way. It's about figuring out which of those two variations works better for white.  On the other hand similar to the other games and it's the opposite of what it should be since the pressure is on. I checked out a different variation that works out a lot better for white so I feel much less pressure. In fact I now feel little to no pressure and more comfortable about my position feeling that I know what to do even though it's technically not supposed to be how it works as you noted in our first game when the pressure was on and I felt it. The new variation would be something like 9.Nf4 exf3 10.axb4 fxg2 11.Nxg2 Bxg2 13.Kxg2 Yes the King is open and we don't always want exchanges. But in that context unlike with the first game it would be forced and I'd find that exchange beneficial because more of the pieces around the open K is what leaves it exposed. By having the pieces exposed my monarch is much safer.  Ken: I guess we will find out how safe it is. I am glad to see you diving into the position in depth. check you variations a bit more still before you decide. There are one or two plausible vartiations you should still lookat.  Joe: I did check out a couple of variations and it's not that safe but still the best option available. With some of these lines I still have more options then the other variations that I checked out.
1324,37,8,Bd6,b'rn1q1rk1/pbppn1pp/1p1bp3/8/3PpN2/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Joe: This takes me by surprise but with the move played however I feel even more comfortable about my position. I'm now thinking about Be3 to complete my development.  Ken: the N cannot stay safely on f4 with my B on d6 and my R on f8  Joe: You're right. I overlooked the Rook as there are three attackers against two defenders. I think that Nh5 would be the way to go here.  Ken: look some more there are 2 other way to protect yourself a biy more subtle  Joe: The only sensible move I can find is Qd2 but it doesn't work because after 10...exf3 11.gxf3 I'm down to the equivalent of a piece and my King becomes exposed since the Queen is moved from the proper diagonal.  The other thing which I can see failing is giving you a free piece in order to threaten which you just drive off anyhow. That variation would be 10.Nh3 exf3 11.Ng5 fxg2 to allow 12.Qh5 but 12...h6 stops the threat.  Ken: a piece is lost no matter what but you have to find the variation that does the least damage explore 10. Ne5 and 10. Bxe4 before you decide  What you will need to work on for the future is adding the mobility of the pieces to your judgement of position. A static assessment isn't enough.  Joe: I did look at a different variation from another angle and after you play ...h6 I'd have Bh7+ winning back a Rook for Knight. But I'm going to look at those other variations that you mentioned.   I looked at the other two variations. I don't like Ne5 as well because instead of ...Bxe5 dxe5 I feel that it's worse if you play ...exd3 and even if I'm to take back I feel that my Nf4 is more important. With that being said I like 10.Bxe4 the best and if then 10...Bxe4 I feel a little more comfortable after 11.Ng5 with a little more mobility and a somewhat similar threat to what I mentioned earlier. And the B is reattacked in return.  Ken: Congrats you've examined all the relevant variations.! Now you get to choose. 
1325,37,9,Bxe4,b'rn1q1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p1bp3/8/3PbN2/P4N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Joe: Now that you've taken back in the way that I thought you would 11.Ng5 comes to mind which is why I took. The idea is attempting counterplay with a difficult variation but not that difficult to drive off. Ng5 will free my Queen so that I can threaten mate with 12.Qg4  Except that it doesn't work. The variation failed because it was a case of Ghost Vision which is typically a bad sign. It's on the same diagnol as your Bd6 which would lose another piece. Therefore I've got to get my Nf4 out of danger. I don't like since my K side is weakened anyhow plus getting a cramped position from that but feel that Ne2 is my only option. Just when I thought it was starting to get good again which is where I typically go wrong also the position is deteriorating for white and more then just the loss of a piece.  Ken:  all true but it isjust stuff that we all have to work on continuously to improve. My weakest point as a player is tactical depth of vision. I see a lot but I misscertain things too.  Joe: I agree. It just takes time. That weakness that you said is something that a GM from what I heard about has and lost a game because. He wasn't just a GM but one of the best players in the world. I believe it was Caruana.  I like the looks of Nd2 or Ng5 and think that there is still something to learn. Could be wrong but am interested in where that would take me.  What I like about Ng5 is that it'll enable me to complete my development. The variation hopefully mobile enough that I've got in mind after wards is to play something like 12.Be3 where not only is development completed but I've added a little pressure on the d file.  Ken: about the best move possible
1326,37,10,Bf5,b'rn1q1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p1bp3/5bN1/3P1N2/P7/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Joe: This I'm sure will be driven off. But it does give me a very small amount of hope for compensating for loss of material even when the threat does get driven off. So I'm thinking of Qh5 to threaten mate. The only question is what happens after ...h6 is played?  Actually there's no threat there. So I'm thinking that instead I would play Be3 to complete development.  Ken: quite true no mate there so look some more  Joe: However I found a move similar to that. It can be driven off but I might be able to pose as a threat against black with a lost of tempo. With that being said I'm thinking of Qf3 to threaten your Rook.  Ken: Certainly a threat that cannot be ignored. I must say I'm surprised but happy for you that my position is as dangerous as it is.  Joe: I agree. It is interesting.
1327,37,11,Nbc6,b'r2q1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1pnbp3/5bN1/3P1N2/P4Q2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Joe: I figured you'd play this. With the threat against my d4 combined with wanting to complete my development I'm thinking that best would be Be3.  Ken: there are other ways to protect d4. look at those too before you decide  Joe: True. The other options are c3 or Ne2. I don't want to play Ne2 as I'm afraid that I won't be able to find a better outpost then after leaving me with a cramped position that is unless Nc3 is to become a good move then after. But I like c3 however. It's based on that but why I also mentioned about the B was development though it's no so important at this stage since we're in the late mid game.  Ken: ok. I think you've analyzed it all.  Joe:  The only thing that I didn't analyze is the one other way to defend. And I like it even better as it not only appears to win back material but might wind up giving me an advantage in what would be similar to a swindle. That would be 13.d5 with the idea being 13...exd5 14.Nxd5 Nxd5 15.Qxd5+ Kh8 16.Nf7+ I do think that black can do something in one of these lines to prevent that but it'll be difficult.  Ken: nothing stops me from responding to 13.d5 with 13..Nd4  Joe: Allright that brings me back at two of those other variations.  I looked at the chat since it was those two moves and I figured out what to do here.  
1328,37,12,Bxf4,b'r2q1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1pn1p3/5bN1/3P1b2/P1P2Q2/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Joe: I was trying to figure out what to do here. So I know that I need to back. I think that taking back with the Bishop is a little better as that way I can complete my development.  Ken: I agree that taking on f4 with the B is safer but not an extraordinary amount safer  
1329,37,13,h6,b'r2q1rk1/p1ppn1p1/1pn1p2p/5bN1/3P1B2/P1P2Q2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: I also reckon that there's not a lot of good moves available at this point.  Ken: true the position is difficult here  Joe: I think that Ne4 is the way to go. Not only don't I lose more material but I'm not forced to place my N on the rim in return.  Ken: The only other possibility is Qg3 but it does cost a knight
1330,37,14,Bh7,b'r2q1rk1/p1ppn1pb/1pn1p2p/8/3PNB2/P1P2Q2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: I am the kind of person that's into centralizing both rooks. With that I'm thinking of Rfe1 as that would enable me to play Rad1 later on.  Ken: that overlooks a threat look again. Hint if you play Re1 one of my knights will move immediately to cause you harm  Joe: Yes ...Ng6 is a problem as mate is threatened against me since the Q and N would work well as you later have ...Qh4 etc. Therefore I think that the position demands Qh3. Even better would be g3 though.  I can't even play that and the threat is worse as you'll win a second piece in the same way that you won the first piece. Yet there's no good choices that are going to prevent this. That's because if I move the B I lose my Queen so that's not an option.  I think the best move available is to give up the N with Qg4 in returning I'm threatening to take on h6 which also threatens mate. You can drive it off but I think with some difficulties since your DSB was exchanged. Aside from that I've got no idea what to do.  Ken: the only other plausible move is g3 but I don't think those variations will be any happier.  Joe:  It's better but you can still play ...Ng6 or even worse if there's something that I don't know about. 
1331,37,15,Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp2pb/1pn1p2p/3n4/3PNB2/P1P2QP1/1P3P1P/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: At this point Bd2 comes to mind to prevent further liquidation.  Ken: that allows Rf8xQf3 and I don't think you want that move played  Joe: I don't. But you've got an added threat against my Bf4. So at the same time as protecting my Queen I'm also trying to figure out how I can prevent further liquidation because due to being ahead your goal is to exchange my Bf3 for your N. I know as that's why you played ...Nd5. So my goal is to prevent that whilst keep my Queen protected.  I see that there isn't however so I'm thinking of Qd3 in an attempt to put some pressure on your Queen side.  Ken: Qd3 would walk in to an immediate pin after 17. Qd3 Nxf4 18. gxf4 d5!  Joe: So that's not an option and neither can I play Qe3 for the obvious reason. Aside from that the only other moves I see as sensible would be Qe2 or Qd1. I prefer Qe2 to leave my Rooks connected.  Ken: Qe2 is the best of your two choices and Qg2 is very similar  Joe: Which one of those two is better?  Ken: I'd call it dead even.
1332,37,16,Nxf4,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp2pb/1pn1p2p/8/3PNn2/P1P3P1/1P2QP1P/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: Although I don't like the position I think the only move for white is gxf4. Not ready yet but believe it or not I think that it's almost a resignable position since this forces my monarch to become exposed. And then after you win another pawn.  Ken: yrs you are in a difficult position.

Actually the pin is needed as otherwise I lose my Queen after Qg4+. I feel that walking into it is the only way to avoid further loss of material.  Ken: f3 is playable as is Ng3  Joe: Which one is better?  Ken: f3 is very slightly better but both positions are difficult
1334,37,18,Bxe4,b'r2q2k1/p1pp2p1/1pn1p2p/8/3Pbr2/P1P2P2/1P2Q2P/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: Now I am forced to take back with fxe4. I'm just not sure what's going to happen after you play ...Qg5+  Ken: I believe your best after Qxg5+ is to play Kh1
1335,37,19,Qg5+,b'r5k1/p1pp2p1/1pn1p2p/6q1/3PPr2/P1P5/1P2Q2P/R4RK1 w - -',Joe: I think so to. I was about what happens after Kh1. I'm interested in that part.  Ken: I will double the Rooks on the f-file.  Joe: That makes sense because there's added pressure.  I agree that Kh1 is the best move.

I'm thinking that instead of liquidating right away hitting your Queen with Rg1 would be better.  And I am thinking about what happens if you play ...Qf6 which I'm ready and prepared for.  Ken: my guess would be you play Rxf4 and I follow with ...Qxf4  
1337,37,21,Rf4f2,b'5rk1/p1pp2p1/1pn1p2p/6q1/3PP3/P1P5/1P2Qr1P/R5RK w - -',Joe: I was thinking of e5.  I did anticipate this.  I think that best would be Qd3 to avoid further liquidation.  Ken: Qd3 fails after I play ...Rxh2+ and you get mated check the variation.  Joe: This is going to force me to liquidate Queens then with Rxg5 which is the last thing that I wanted to do.  Ken: yes it is designed to do exactly that force the liquidation down to an endgame that is as the GM's say a simple matter of technique (meaning an easy win a piece ahead).  Joe: Yes I'm about ready to resign here. I was thinking along the lines of Rxg5 but Qxf2 came into consideration. But I gave this more thought and the reason I stayed in this long is that I felt that there was more for me to learn with the Queen's still on the board. But without them I feel that there's nothing else to learn.  Ken:  If you play Rxg5 I play Rxe2 and you will have to move R(g5) allowing me to play R8f2 doubling the Rooks. If you play Qxf2 I play Rxf2 and you follow RxQ which I follow with hxRg5 and it liquidates down to your R and 6 pawns against my R N and 7 pawns which is a simple win.  Joe: With that this is where I resign. I enjoyed the coaching so I guess that lesson 2 is to look at things from the more mobile perspective as that's how I lost material.

The d3 pawn had several defenders including the bishop on c1 and the knight on b1. Always keep track of the number of attackers vs the number of defenders and remember you need one attacker more than the number of defenders to safely take a piece in most circumstances. It would have been more wise for black to remove a defender by taking the c1 bishop with either the d3N or the a3B.  Note that Bxe2# continues to be an unqualified blunder although it is debatable whether Bxe2# would be better or worse then Qxd2 since Black really only manages to trade his queen for a pawn and manages to go down -18 points in material as a consequence. However there are substantial subtleties at play with Qxd2+ none more influential than the the complete and total opening of the d file which will prove to be significant for black's coutnerattack eventually culminating in vicegrip control of the d3 square...

I cannot stress enough the importance of paying attention to which files are open and closed -- remember queens and rooks love open files...Still not a good idea for black to move Bxe2# less in this instance because of the monumental collapse of tempo that it would cause and more due to the risk of disruption of the carefully crafted and ever so delicate balance between the pulled pork sandwich of move 14 and the truly delicious skewer of move 9.

Note that promotion to a Queen or Rook or Bishop would not have been able to control that g6 square -- only a knight would do the trick!

1381,38,43,Kc6,b'1B5N/8/2k5/8/2p5/p2b4/2PK4/8 w - -',The underpromotion to a bishop was warranted here because getting a queen would have risked a stalemate and convoluted control of the c file while promotion to a rook or knight would not have succeeded at checking the king in order to gain tempo. Underpromotions are unique situations but in those rare cases they are necessary. Also let me approach the issue a different way -- would it be better to blatantly hang a queen or blatantly hang a bishop? I think we would all agree it would be better to irresponsibly hang a bishop and thus there is no reason to promote to anything other than a bishop in this situation. 
1382,38,44,Kd5,b'1B6/5N2/8/3k4/2p5/p2b4/2PK4/8 w - -',The Black king is regrouping! 
1383,38,45,Ke4,b'8/5N2/8/4B3/2p1k3/p2b4/2PK4/8 w - -',Black King is preparing to attack! 
1384,38,46,Kxe5,b'8/8/3N4/4k3/2p5/p2b4/2PK4/8 w - -',He strikes! 
1385,38,47,Kxd6,b'8/8/3k4/8/2p5/p2P4/3K4/8 w - -',White tries to undo the strong control of d3 black had but only succeeded in losing his last minor piece! 
1386,38,48,Kc5,b'8/8/8/2k5/2P5/p7/3K4/8 w - -',And now the game is essentially over as White cannot get his King over in time. 
1387,38,49,a2,b'8/8/8/2k5/2P5/8/p3K3/8 w - -',Sometimes when you are down in a chess game it is a good idea to try running away. Unfortunately you can only run to other squares on the chess board and there is no J file even with significant tempo...
1388,38,50,Kxc4,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/p2K4/8 w - -',White realizes that if Black makes a mistake he can actually catch up to the last remaining pawn...
1389,38,51,5Kc2,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/p1K5/8 b - -',Here we see basic opposition -- in an endgame situation you can control the movement of the other King by staying one square away from him and the other King cannot advance forward. However this opposition will be shortlived because the White King leaves himself vulnerable to a check if black underpromotes to a Knight...
1390,38,52,5a1=B,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/2K5/b7 w - -',And then beautiful Finale! I would have thought you would underpromote to a Knight there but the genuis of black in underpromoting to a bishop truly cannot be questioned....
1391,38,53,Bh8,b'7b/8/8/8/2k5/8/8/1K6 w - -',For some reason White kept going trying to play it out but to no avail...It is always better to tip your King when you are in a truly lost position -- it can be a sign of respect and an acknowledgement of an opponent's brilliance to resign before the culmination of the mating sequence...
1392,38,54,Bc3,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/2b5/2K5/8 w - -',But here White tries to hang on...
1393,38,55,Be1,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/8/3Kb3 w - -',and on
1394,38,56,Bf2,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/4Kb2/8 w - -',and on
1395,38,57,Bg1,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/8/5Kb1 w - -',and on
1396,38,58,Bh2,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/6Kb/8 w - -',and on
1397,38,59,Bg1,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/8/6bK w - -',and on
1398,38,60,5Kxg1,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/8/6K1 b - -',AND THE FINAL MOVE ---- 
1399,38,61,5Kc3,b'8/8/8/8/8/2k5/8/6K1 w - -',And with the incalculable Kc3 move Black has finally finished White off and White tips his King! I hope you enjoyed this lesson its a good one for the kids out there --- a game is never so drawn that you can't ensure a loss with a resignation especially when (as we see in the final position here) every single file is completely open and both sides have all the time in the worlds to threaten tempo & tactics while eating pulled pork sandwiches and bbq skewers...still advising against Bxe2#...Cheers!
1400,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I start off with my usual but am not sure what Loyd will do next because he plays different moves.
1401,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',But he plays this.  And after I continue with my normal I speculate on what he'll do next since he does different things.
1402,39,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But after this move I convert to the Spanish opening and I stick with mainlines for a while to avoid complications.  Worth noting that my win against Bernard also involved the Ruy Lopez and likewise we stuck to mainlines.
1403,39,3,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq d6',This is where it goes start going off course.  That's because the N generally retreats after which 6.Nxe5.  Because Loyd deviated...
1404,39,4,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4n3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I played this as I'm interested in how he responds.  However I forgot something which was that the N was pinned.  Had I taken note of this I would've played 6.Nxe5 which was better as that would've gotten a pawn back.  However he overlooked my pawn.  So thinking that the Knight would be protected he played 6...Bf5?? after which I almost overlooked what to do.  But I remembered that one reason I played this was for a moment like this.  Therefore when brought the other Bishop out I immediately took on e4.
1405,39,5,dxe4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B2pb2/4p3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Loyd thought that he compensated and kept the pawn.  But what he overlooked is something I missed a move earlier with his Nx6.  With that I immediately take advantage and launch a double attack with 8.Nxe5.
1406,39,6,Qxd1,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B2Nb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBqR1K1 w kq -',Preventing the loss of more material he takes my Queen.  I was almost unprepared for that but was happy to see that exchange because I'm ahead.  Therefore this liquidation is to my benefit.
1407,39,7,Rxd1,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B2Nb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 b kq -',This is where the annotation stops.  That's because Loyd castles long on the next move.  I don't know why the board isn't allowing me to castle as that's a legal move.  Castling does not put black in check.  So the game continued with 9...0-0-0 10.Nxc6+ bxc6 11.Bxc6 Bc5 12.Bf4 Rhd8 13.Rxd8 Rxd8 14.Nc3 Bd6 15.Bxd6 cxd6 16.Re1 Rc8 17.Bxe4 g6 18.Bxf5 gxf5 19.Re7 Rc4 20.Rxf7 Rd4 21.g3 Rd2 22.Rxh7 Rxc2 23.Rd7 Rxb2 24.Rxd6 Rc2 25.Rd5 Rxc3 26.Rxf5 Ra3 27.h4 Rxa2 28.Kg2 Re2 29.h5 Re8 30.h6 Kc7 31.Rh5 Kd7 32.h7 Rh8 33.g4 Ke7 34.g5 Kf7 35.f4 Kg6 36.Rh6+ Kg7 37.f5 a5 38.f6+ Kf8 39.g6 a4 40.g7+ and Loyd resigned here because of the fork.  Consequently I'd Queen and win his Rook without compensation.  Not long afterwards it would be made so black knew that there was no hope left at this point.
