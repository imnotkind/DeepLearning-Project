382,9,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The Latvian Gambit. I have a whole bunch of annotated games in this opening take a look at them for the main lines. It is generally pretty unsound but can be strong in blitz if White is not prepared!
383,9,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Too passive for my tastes. Better are 3.Nxe5 3.exf5 or 3.d4.
384,9,2,h3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',? Put simply this move accomplishes nothing. It doesn't make way for development; it doesn't prevent any threats and it doesn't threaten anything. Much better was 4.d4.
385,9,3,Nd5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1B1Npp2/1b2P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
386,9,4,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1BbNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Now Black threatens ...Nxe4.
387,9,5,Bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2B2n2/2bNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I don't like this even though there's nothing obviously wrong with it. White initiates a series of trades that leaves him with only one developed piece and a hanging pawn all while accelerating Black's development. Better was 7.d3 or even 7.d4.
388,9,6,dxc6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2p2n2/2bNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Anticipating 8.Nxf6+ Qxf6 Black is making ready to castle queenside so this move is preferable to 7...bxc6.
389,9,7,f4,b'r1b1k2r/ppp3pp/2p2q2/2b1p3/4Pp2/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black releases the tension in the center in preparation for castling; he must close off the White Bishop's scope. This also foreshadows the massive kingside attack that is Black's signature in this opening.
390,9,8,Be6,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/2p1bq2/2b1p3/4Pp2/2PP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Developing while subtly preventing 11.d4 since 11...O-O-O would pin and subsequently win the d-pawn.
391,9,9,1b4,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/2p1bq2/2b1p3/1P2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq b3',White kicks the Bishop anyway but he desperately needs to be thinking about finishing his development--Black is almost done and White still only has one piece off its home square.
392,9,10,1Qa4,b'r3k2r/ppp3pp/1bp1bq2/4p3/QP2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P4PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',This seems to be intended to prevent 12...c5 but Black is obviously ready to castle here. Developing the Bishop or simply castling were preferable; this just wastes a tempo.
393,9,11,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp3pp/1bp1bq2/4p3/QP2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P4PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Forcing another Queen move for White as he must now defend the backward d3 pawn.
394,9,12,g5,b'2kr3r/ppp4p/1bp1bq2/4p1p1/1P2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ g6',With his King safely tucked away Black begins to march on the White kingside. Black is now completely developed whereas White still hasn't castled and is at least a move away from being able to (unless he wants to go kingside but that looks... risky).
395,9,13,1a4,b'2kr3r/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p1pp/PP2Pp2/2PP1N1P/1BQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ a3',White responds with an aggressive posture though I think Bd2 and O-O-O would have been safer. As it is White is threatening to trap the DSB but Black has a preemptive response...
396,9,14,1g4,b'2kr3r/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p2p/PP2Ppp1/2PP1N1P/1BQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Thanks to White's unconnected Rooks Black is happy to blow the h-file open and kick the Knight back at the same time. Removing the Knight from f3 also make h4 look particularly inviting for the BQ.
397,9,15,1hxg4,b'2kr3r/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p2p/PP2PpP1/2PP1N2/1BQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',I think the immediate 16.Nh2 would be better to prevent giving Black the h-file uncontested.
398,9,16,Rxh8,b'2k4r/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p3/PP2Ppp1/2PP1N2/1BQ2PP1/R3K3 w Q -',Now g1 is the only reasonable place for the Knight (since 18.Nd2 runs into immediate problems after 18...Bxf2+! where if White captures 19.Kxf2 Qh4 20.Ke2 Qg3 21.Rg1 Rh2 and there's no way to stop the g-pawn from falling as well) which is why I think Nh2 should have been played earlier.
399,9,17,1O-O-O,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p3/PP2Ppp1/2PP4/1BQ2PP1/2KR2Nr b - -',White finally castles now that it's literally the only way to save his Knight (though that doesn't last long...). 
400,9,18,1Qh4,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1b3/4p3/PP2Pppq/2PP4/1BQ2PP1/2KR2Nr w - -',The Black Queen's time has come and what an entrance she makes.
401,9,19,2Rf1,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1b3/4p3/PP2Pppq/2PP4/1BQ2PP1/2K2RNr b - -',White would have been better served by playing 20.d4 or maybe 20.c4 and trying to get his Bishop to somewhere useful. The text just needlessly weakens his position by removing the defense of the Rook--so now White's Knight is pinned as well.
402,9,20,2c4,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1b3/4p3/PPP1Pp1q/3P2p1/1BQ2PP1/2K2RNr b - -',? This would have been okay last move but it's far too late here. 21.Qe2 was worth a look allowing 22.Nf3.
403,9,21,2gxf2,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1b3/4p3/PPP1Pp1q/3P4/1BQ2pP1/2K2RNr w - -',White has to lose a piece to eliminate the advanced pawn now and the f4-pawn is nearly as big a threat looming on the horizon. The Ng1 can't even move out of the way since it's still pinned to the undefended Rook.
404,9,22,2Bxe5,b'2k5/ppp5/1bp1b3/4B3/PPP1Pp1q/3P4/2Q2pP1/2K2RNr b - -',0-1. White eagerly snatches up the e5 pawn only to realize that he's terribly lost anyway; his Rook and Knight are both about to fall to Black's pawn (probably after 22...Be3+) and he has no counterplay opportunities whatsoever so he throws in the towel. Thanks to mesledarya for a fun game! Comments are much appreciated; thanks for reading!
405,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',It is a long time ago I haven't annotated a game. I wish to do it here because I tryed once again to play against my own style. Many times I lose this time I won but this was not the important thing. I think my opponent tryed special things too especially around move 23 and followings. For this I found this game interesting.
406,10,1,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',these were the imposed moves. I must admit I would never play this as black. Neither as white as I never play e4...
407,10,2,Bf8,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I found this move in a database I have to admit and I really liked it so I decided to try it. Isn't it why these tournaments are for? 
408,10,3,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/4pp2/2ppP1B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',From now I am on freewheel. It is very interesting to enter into games where you never entered before. I  would nevere have dared to try this kind of configuration in another situation too afraid to be trapped after 10 moves... or less...
409,10,4,Nxf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Already planned to rook as fast as possible with the f column open. Remarking my e-pawn is as weak as a lamb in front of the wolf.
410,10,5,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/1Bpp2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',this made me rethink my idea to put bKnight on d7.
411,10,6,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b2pp/2n1pn2/1BppN1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',the big fight already. The kind of thing we average players play chess for... and usually don't find...

Black loose because i think there where  overconfident. A Elo rating doesnt mean that is is the maximum rate...

520,13,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now it transposes into the King's Knight Opening.  For me this is standard and I play it almost as often as the Open Sicilian Variation.
521,13,3,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',I originally thought that he would play 2...Nc6 so that I could transpose into the Ruy Lopez.  However he drops a pawn so I decide to take advantage by grabbing it.  Afterall it is a free pawn and it does not expose my King at the moment.
522,13,4,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/8/2b1pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"This is good because he is developing but I would have played 3...Nf6 instead because it is said that you are supposed to develop your knight before the bishop.  However General Opening Principle does not matter that much.  Afterall GM tactical-abyss and tigerlilov said that principles are only general guidelines to go by but they do not always help you to win.  In some cases you will win if you do not always follow the guidelines.  In fact that was one reason that I posted an annotation about ""Poor Opening Play"" and stated that you sometimes have to play badly in order to play well.  Of course some people disagree with that assessment.  "
523,13,5,Nxe5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/8/2b1NP2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?? I figured that I would take advantage by grabbing another pawn because he left it hanging.  However I discovered that he deliberately gave it away but why would he sac this pawn?  As it turns out this is a deflective sacrifice that will eventually become a gambit.  Having said that this is a very big mistake.  In fact it is a loosing blunder because this will expose my King.  However I am nowhere near ready to resign yet. 
524,13,6,Bxf2+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/8/4NP2/8/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In this position my best move is 5.Kxf2 taking his DSB.  Afterall I only have one other option but it still exposes my King and takes away the opportunity to castle given that I have to move the King.
525,13,7,Qh4+,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/8/4NP2/7q/8/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ1B1R w kq -',Now I am back in check so I only have several options.  In this position g3 is best but it is better to move my King backward then forward.  However I chose to move it forward which exacerbates the King exposure. 
526,13,8,Ne7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppn1pp/8/4NP2/7q/5K2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1B1R w kq -',Now he is getting ready to continue develop and castle Kingside.
527,13,9,g3,b'rnb1k2r/ppppn1pp/8/4NP2/7q/5KP1/PPPP3P/RNBQ1B1R b kq -',Now I decide to kick his Queen but it is a little late for that because I am no longer in check.
528,13,10,Qd4,b'rnb1k2r/ppppn1pp/8/4NP2/3q4/5KP1/PPPP3P/RNBQ1B1R w kq -',In this position I can only protect my Knight by moving my f Queen to the e file.  However I do not do that because I was not completely concentrating and I am only thinking about development which is another way for me to remember that General Opening Principles are only guidelines that do not always work.  As a result of my next move he will win back a piece.
529,13,11,g4,b'rnb1k2r/ppppn1pp/8/4qP2/2B3P1/5K2/PPPP3P/RNBQ3R b kq -',Now I think about connecting my pawns but the timing is off because this is not an endgame.

532,13,14,1Bb7+,b'rn2k2r/pbppn1pp/8/1p2qP2/2BP2P1/5K2/PPP4P/RNBQ3R w kq -',And he decides to place me back in check but this is a mere nuicanse because I will get out of it by moving my King back.  This is good because I will reduce the exposure that I had excaserbated earlier.
533,13,15,Qe4,b'rn2k2r/pbppn1pp/8/1p3P2/2BPq1P1/8/PPP2K1P/RNBQ3R w kq -',I do not know why he played this because we know that he is not going to win the h1 Rook do to my Queen.
534,13,16,1Rg1,b'rn2k2r/pbppn1pp/8/1p3P2/2BPq1P1/8/PPP2K1P/RNBQ2R1 b kq -',In this position my intentions are to put pressure on the h-file because I can not castle but it is a mistake because he is going to win another free piece that I cannot get back.  Having said that this is not gambit or a deflective sac so 12.Bd3 was best as it kicks the Queen again.
535,13,17,1Nc3,b'rn2k2r/pbppn1pp/8/5P2/2pPq1P1/2N5/PPP2K1P/R1BQ2R1 b kq -',Therefore I will kick it with my Knight because I want to develop with an intention to connect my rooks.  Note: GM Kasparov was able to connect his rooks despite not castling.  In fact he decided not to castle for that reason.
536,13,18,1Qe2,b'rn2k2r/pbppn1pp/2q5/5P2/2pP2P1/2N5/PPP1QK1P/R1B3R1 b kq -',And I decide to bring my Queen out for the same reason that I had mentioned on move 13.
537,13,19,1O-O,b'rn3rk1/pbppn1pp/2q5/5P2/2pP2P1/2N5/PPP1QK1P/R1B3R1 w - -',Now he takes advantage of his opportunities and decides to castle.
538,13,20,1d5,b'rn3rk1/pbppn1pp/2q5/3P1P2/2p3P1/2N5/PPP1QK1P/R1B3R1 b - -',Once again I decide to kick his Queen but best was 15.Qxe7 winning back a piece.  This will allow him to win a free pawn with the same Knight that I should have captured and I do not like to give away material.  So far I do not think that I am playing well at all.
539,13,21,1Qe5,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/2q5/3nQP2/2p3P1/2N5/PPP2K1P/R1B3R1 b - -',Now I am trying to figure out a way to get something back but it will not work.
540,13,22,1Nb4,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/2q5/4QP2/1np3P1/2N5/PPP2K1P/R1B3R1 w - -',He wants to win another free pawn but I am not going to allow that.  Instead I will protect it with my final phase of development.
541,13,23,Qf3+,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/8/4QPB1/1np3P1/2N2q2/PPP2K1P/R5R1 w - -',Of course I would have finished connecting my rooks if it was feasible but he is not going allow it.  Therefore he decides to place me back in check and it is serious because he is going to win another free pawn.  On the other hand I will get out of it by alleviating the exposure even more given that I am moving back to the first rank.  
542,13,24,1Kd2,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/8/4QPB1/2p3P1/2N2q2/PPnK3P/R5R1 b - -',In this position it is unlikely that I will be able to win so I try to trick him into a draw by repetition.  Note: my King was on d2 before I had played 18.Ke1.  However he is going to see through it and my attempt is not going to work.  
543,13,25,1Qd3+,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/8/4QPB1/2p3P1/2Nq4/PPnK3P/R5R1 w - -',"This is why.  Instead of 19...Qf3+ he plays this.  Now I am only interested in getting my King back to ""Square one"" (the first rank.)"
544,13,26,Nd4,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/8/4QPB1/2pn2P1/2Nq4/PP5P/R1K3R1 w - -',In this position my only option is to sac my Queen for his d3 knight or 21...Qc2# mating me in one.  Therefore I now know that the game is officially lost for white.  However I am not going to resign until I am out of options because I am still learning.  As a couple of commentators have illustrated you only stay in when you have things to learn.  As it turns out I am going to learn a lot more so stay tuned.
545,13,27,2Rd1,b'rn3rk1/pbpp2pp/8/5PB1/2pq2P1/2N5/PP5P/R1KR4 b - -',? At this point I am going to kick his Queen because it has caused a lot of damage.  However I was not thinking clearly and this turns out to be another mistake because he is going to win my g4 pawn for free.  BTW that was the only pawn connected so this also leaves my f5 pawn and DSB hanging.
546,13,28,2Be7,b'rn3rk1/pbppB1pp/8/5P2/2p3q1/2N5/PP5P/R1KR4 b - -',I decide to kick his f1 Rook this time to protect my DSB.  There is however one drawback.  In this position he is going to place me in a check that I percieve as a nuicanse.  However this is very serious.  Why?  
547,13,29,2Qf4+,b'rn3rk1/pbppB1pp/8/5P2/2p2q2/2N5/PP5P/R1KR4 w - -',"This is the reason and it is where I also learn even more.  Until now I had no idea that he was threatening mate.  However my opponent said that 23.Re7 was the only way to prevent mate.  That was he implied that 23.Be7??  There was some move that was a lot better then Be7 but I forgot what that was.  Bigpeta said that my last move got me into even more trouble.  Nonetheless I am still not going to resign yet.  As Jack Stockel would say ""It's not so easy"" and ""Try to find a way out of trouble""."
548,13,30,Re8,b'rn2r1k1/pbppB1pp/8/5P2/2p2q2/2N5/PP1R3P/R1K5 w - -',?? He decides to kick my DSB but that does not bother me because I will do that to his Queen in return.  However there is a drawback to Kicking his Queen.  What is it?
549,13,31,Qf1+,b'rn2r1k1/pbppB1pp/8/5P2/2p5/8/PP1RN2P/R1K2q2 w - -',That's the problem.  This is very bad because I either have to loose my other Knight or the a1 Rook.  26.Rd1 is the only way to protect that Rook.
550,13,32,Qxf5,b'rn2r1k1/pbppB1pp/8/5q2/2p5/8/PP2N2P/R1KR4 w - -',As implied earlier 26...Qxe2 was best.
551,13,33,2Nd4,b'rn2r1k1/pbppB1pp/8/5q2/2pN4/8/PP5P/R1KR4 b - -',Now I decide to take advantage by reattacking his Queen.  Afterall I do not know what else to do because the game is still lost for white.  It goes by what Black-cat-hamelet (previously know as x-machine) told me.  It only pays to play poorly when you are clearly loosing and do not think that you have a chance to pull a win or draw.
552,13,34,2Qf4+,b'rn2r1k1/pbppB1pp/8/8/2pN1q2/8/PP5P/R1KR4 w - -',And he decides to place me back in check.  This time however I am going to get out of this with my d1 Rook as opposed to the King because I do not want to expose it even worse then it already is.  On the other hand this is serious because he is going to do what he could have done several moves ago.  What is that?  Now he is going to win my DSB for free after I get out of check.
553,13,35,2Nb5,b'rn4k1/pbppr1pp/8/1N6/2p2q2/8/PP1R3P/R1K5 b - -',?? Hoping for anything and seeing what I can get out of it I decide to attack his c7 pawn.  I thought that he had no way of defending it or his a8 Rook in this position.  This way I would be able to get something back but I was completely wrong.
554,13,36,2Re2,b'rn4k1/pbpp2pp/8/1N6/2p2q2/8/PP1Rr2P/R1K5 w - -',This is why.  He is attacking my d2 Rook and I cannot play 30.Rxe2 as it would be illegal.  Therefore mate is inevitable and it is mate in two even if 30.Nxc7.  Why?  30...Qxd2 31.Qb1 (forced) 31...Re1# so I resign.  Overall I learned an important lesson about the Leftian Gambit.  It is a true gambit that often wins for black.  That was illustrated in this particular game.
555,14,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I keep using this system despite I know it is inferior against a strong player. But it is always fun to see how things get out...
556,14,1,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Finally something - and better IMO - than Nc3! It is very dangerous to play against this. 
557,14,2,e5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',if Nc3 Bb5 a6 BxN bxN is a likely outcome. Qa5 is a move I don't like. 
558,14,3,dxe5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Thank you white. You give me the castling rights but without the queens the game will be interesting. As in fact was. 
559,14,4,Qxd1+,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBqKBNR w KQkq -',The alternative Qxe4+ is also playable. Black has attack but I preferred this line. 
560,14,5,Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBK1BNR w kq -',Developing + threatening but the f pawn was to go on f4 anyway sooner or later. 
561,14,6,b6,b'rnb1k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBK1BNR w kq -',...so I can exploit the big diagonal... though this path is no with no dangers as we'll see. With the text move I take advantage on the fact that the black bishop can't be easily kicked by pawns (c3-b4 is too costly for developement). 
562,14,7,Bb7,b'rn2k1nr/pbp2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBK1B1R w kq -',It's always uneasy to play against this. 
563,14,8,Bd3,b'rn2k1nr/pbp2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBK3R b kq -',White has to be very careful with the diagonal. 
564,14,9,Ne7,b'rn2k2r/pbp1nppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBK3R w kq -',This knight is going to try to take advantage from the half pinned Nf3 and g2.
565,14,10,Ng6,b'rn2k2r/pbp2ppp/1p4n1/2b1P3/5P2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BK3R w kq -',I'll be glad about BxN. Now the danger is f5 but BxN+ gxB Nxe4 Re8 and the N is pinned but no pawn can kick him and f6 defends it as Nd7 and Bd6 just in case so no worry about that. 
566,14,11,1Be4,b'rn2k2r/pbp2ppp/1p4n1/2b1P3/4BP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BK3R b kq -',...but white surprises me with this rather obvious plan. I had my think here finding out what was the best move. Bc6 c6 or Nc6? Hard choice.

I didn't even think on this move. ok. let's see: even if it seems better to keep the pawns together I thought that after the storm it would be nice to be able to play c5 to keep the white's dsb off the action from b4. 
572,14,17,1Bxb6,b'2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1b4n1/4n3/4BP2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R w - -',My bishop here is also safe from b4! by white. 
573,14,18,1Bxb7+,b'2kr3r/pBp2ppp/1b4n1/4n3/5P2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R b - -',As expected. 
574,14,19,1fxe5,b'3r3r/pkp2ppp/1b4n1/4P3/8/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R b - -',Now I can recover the pawn. I'm not sure I've played the best way maybe my advantage is not so great as if I had kept the tension. Anyway the position is still good for me because white can't castle. 
575,14,20,Rd7,b'4r3/pkpr1ppp/1b4n1/4P3/8/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2KR3 w - -',Ok I have to admit I wasn't on a clear plan here but I would have doubled the rookd depending on his move. Dont' do that at home :-)
576,14,21,1Re4,b'4r3/pkpr1ppp/1b4n1/4P3/4R3/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K4 b - -',Inmediately glanced f5 after the rook retires f4! would be very interesting for black. But I couldn't see it so clearly. 
577,14,22,1h6,b'4r3/pkpr1pp1/1b4np/4P3/4R3/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K4 w - -',He can't really add the other rook to the defence so I have time to be profilactic and protect my rooks from Bg5 if they want to be free to double safely. 
578,14,23,1Ke2,b'4r3/pkpr1pp1/1b4np/4P3/4R3/5N2/PPPBK1PP/R7 b - -',Now I told myself it was the time to play the attack. After exf6 RxR+ Kf1 black's position is wonderful even after gxf6.

Best was 15.Nc6! Qe8 16.Be4 when 16...Nxe4?? fails to 17.Nxe7+ etc. so Black has to play 16...Bb7 17.Nxe7 Qxe7 18.Bxf6 gxf6 (18...Qxf6?? 19.Bxb7). 15.Bxf6? Bxf6 16.Be4 doesn't win an exchange as we thought in the post-game analysis because after 16...Ra7 17.Nc6 Black can exchange queens and then save his rook. also 15.Be4? accomplishes nothing due to 15...Nxe4 16.Bxe7 Qxe7 17.Rxe4 Bb7 and Black's position is at least equal if not better.

But why would I get into such a complicated line if I'm simply better by playing normal moves?

My computer programme Fritz seems not to like it that much at first and considers 17.Bc2 better but after analyzing a bit it says White has an advantage in this line as well.
808,21,18,1exf5,b'r4rk1/3bbpp1/pq3n1p/1p3p2/7B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',This is virtually forced. 17...Bd8?? 18.Nxh6+! gxh6 19.Bxf6 Bxf6 20.Qxf6 and Black is dead lost 17...Re8?? fails to the same line or 17...Qd8 just leaves White in total control of the game after 18.Be4.
809,21,19,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/3bRpp1/pq3n1p/1p3p2/7B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',An alternative given by Fritz is 18...g5!? when Fritz comes up with an interesting line: 19.Rxd7! Nxd7 20.Qxf5 Qg6 21.Qxd7 Qh5! 22.Be4 Qxh4. However this position must be better for White as well. Black wanted to avoid all this so he decided to protect his bishop a second time.

813,21,23,2Kg7,b'3r1r2/3b1pk1/pq3n1p/1p6/5Q2/2PB4/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',?! And while I was pondering over my next move Black suddenly offered a draw which I decided to accept. With 22...Rfe8 he could have taken the sting out of my attack by forcing an exchange of rooks (or forcing my rook to leave the e-file). In the analysis my opponent said he felt that I was better in the final position while I thought my position was equal at best. According to the computer I was right: after 23.Re3 (which was one of the two moves along with 23.Qg3+ that I was considering) it gives the position as 0.00 because 23...Nd5 virtually forces a move repetition with 24.Qe5+ Nf6 and there's nothing better than simply 25.Qf4 Nd5 repeating moves. I don't really see an improvement on that line either. We were also running quite low on time already and I felt I would not be able to win in the attack because I needed time to calculate and I'm not good at rapid or blitz chess. Finally I was also happy with a draw against a player with almost 1600. I guess the draw was a fair result of this game. Thanks for reading this annotation and please feel free to comment.

Ardin kindly put this game into the It Can Be Done thread many moons ago.  Although this isn't an Expert draw it is a Near-Expert Draw and there is a 500 point rating differential between the two sides.  It looked as though Ardin's opponent was gonna cop Old Matey.  In fact the black king was in Old Matey's shadow but a stunning sacrifice of the black queen ensured that Ardin delivered the wrong kind of mate.  So how did this happen?  Well here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13171068&rnd=0.9733391231055444"

Nd6 - this leaves Ardin's knight en prise Checkmate is tempted to swipe it but suddenly he starts to shiver  there is a dark dark shadow all of a sudden and the air is absolutely foul in front of the black king.  It is that chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey and his scythe is about to descend on h7 (Rh7#).  Checkmate sees the mate however and defends with h6.

If that is not the case then he who crowns first lands the first check which could be at best annoying at worst tragic.

863,24,27,5Kxa7,b'2R2Q2/K6k/7p/7P/1R6/8/8/8 b - -',58. Kxa7 STALEMATE.  White had no choice.  Incredibly the WK had only one legal move and that was to take the BQ.  A mere 19 points up Ardin had to contend himself with a near-Expert Draw.  Ardin played really well he kept his Class A opponent on the back foot for a lot of the game and attempted to go for the jugular and only very late on did black attempt any counterplay - white simply did not allow any until that unfortunate capture.  Ardin's king was then exposed to a series of checks from the BQ and BR until his opponent forced that stalemate.  Well played Ardin and keep it up!  Joanne
