It is an irregular opening which people can frown upon, but the problem still remain that I had in my second game.  I've been losing it when we get into territory that I wasn't used to.  This on top of other things was why I got some needed training from the lord since in situations I was more like the turtose, as opposed to, the hair.  Ken saw this when I blundered a piece in our second game.  Problems then happened in the recent team match even earlier.  I wasn't used to what the opening became, and therefore, wasn't patience.  That resulted in losing a piece even earlier, in which I was very lucky to get off with a draw.  But, I agree with ION as the only reason that I offered it was because I didn't see how he could win.  However, there were opportunities, so it probably would've been better to decline the offer.  The same thing happened with Ted.  Where after having had won a piece in the Ruy Lopez, we got into unfamiliar territory.  I made a terrible blunder that should've given Ted the advantage.  Best play would put me the equivalent to a piece and pawn behind with advantage to him.  But, once he missed the opportunity and grabbed my R, immediately, it was mate.  From that, I realize that in situations you're not used, one must take even more time and do more calculation on what to do next.  But, Ken is very good at this as the move played shows.  This is why he can invent different variations which I find to be important for learning purposes, as for me, we're, once again, in unfamiliar territory."

During my second training game with Ken, he said that I needed to give more thought then just what I was told.

Not only that, but GM Susan Polgar mentioned about that same square in a course that I took with her.  And, Jack also emphasizes to watch the f file which is what I also tell my students.  The real question is what can black do about it.  At first, I was starting to get a little nervous because, at the time, I thought that 5...Be6 was the only option.  But, I am not ready to exchange yet, especially since my weakest pawn would be removed.  In return, I'd also have difficulty in castling since the K would be at risk of exposure.

In return I am able to apply what I learned from charleshiggie which is what I taught milly64 before finding out that for the one move that my assessment was wrong.  But, what I enjoy is centralizing my N which is the entire plan behind exchanging.  The idea behind centralizing my N is to gain more tempo since his Bc4 will be attacked.

I also considered 11...Nd7 but that appears to cramp my position which I didn't want.  At the time, I was afraid to do it, but since I did with my recent student, flatus77, I figured that it, in my opinion, would've been the best move.  But, that didn't happen as I thought that best was to exchange with 11...Nd5.

The story is that I had 30 minutes, whereas, others had 55 minutes.  But, now Jack is only going to give me a max of 25 minutes and more like 20 minutes.

Had that been so, that would've won the Rook as there'd be no escape.  Since it hadn't moved, this should've lost the Queen.  With that being said, a more experienced player would've done that.  And, had Ted taken on a2, I would've resigned since there would be no compensation in return.  I feel that Ghost Vision like this is caused by getting distracted and ION told me about a game where a GM lost with Ghost Vision.  I believe that he was also distracted.  However, I was very lucky that Ted overlooked this.  Having said that, I believe that best would've been to exchange Queens with 16...Qxc3.  And, if I didn't have the Ghost Vision caused by the internal distraction, that is how I would've responded, instead."

So, not being able to record the rest (due to a corrupted position) combined with Ted getting counterplay right after 22...Bxd3? which is what I played, I was figuring out what to do this move.  Therefore, I made a very difficult decision to annotate this move, for afterwards the same thing happens occurred in that variation which I recorded in that corrupted position.  And, it's black winning the other Rook without anything in return.  Had I played this Ted would've resigned immediately for the same reason.  As there is no counterplay or hopes of survival from this point on.  In the future, I am going to create a door for anything that happens outside of the game just like at work.  I'm confident that in doing so, I'll be able to block and/or get rid of the unwanted distractions.

Seems a little premature but black is going to take on d4 and have 5 pawns for the piece. 3 connected kingside and 2 queenside. Defending here seems hard to impossible. Black is the only one who can win this and the computer confirms they are winning. After taking on d4 they can go f5 Kf6 or push c5 c4 or both. White just has to try to complicate this. I find the marshall to be fun to play and think you should give it a go. Give up a pawn in the center for great attacking chances. But if white defends well early you can still give up a piece for a chain of pawns. A little technique and those pawns become queens. 5 pawns is still a ton of pawns with diminished materiel.

If I had more of this in the beginning and didn't rush to break that pin, I wouldn't have blundered a piece so early.  And, to remember this important lesson, I think about the tortoise and the hair which is a famous story.  The moral to that story is exactly the same as the first game against this opponent.  That's why I remember that here since as they say, ""slow and steady wins the race"" because it's another example of why it's important to be patient."

The idea behind this attack and many similar opening gambits is to sacrifice a pawn for active counterplay on some part of the board, relying on compensation for the pawn. What is the compensation here? White intends to castle quickly, get the rooks in the middle and somehow keep black's king in the middle to attack. Alternatively there is often a strong attack against the f7 pawn if black castles with the bishop on c8 undeveloped. So white is playing against passive pieces and a slightly airy king. Lets see how this one goes. "

This whole idea is why taking with the knight on the previous move doesn't really work. White still just plays c3 here, and d4 next, with a nice center, easy development and soon will look for a strong attack. 5..Ba5 aims to stop all that because if d4 then the c3 pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake, making that strong center.

White has better (only slightly at this point) piece activity and better pawns and more pawns (technically material is equal) but this move allows for 3 connected passed pawns down the middle with rooks to back them up. taking on e5 and giving up 2 pawns for piece activity is probably the way to go.

The pawn on h6 is still annoying and if white ever wins the h7 pawn is close to queening. This position is so hard because there really isn't counterplay. Just sit around and hope for a mistake. Thanks for reading. I really enjoying playing this game and thought I was totally winning somewhere around the sacrifice but missing dxe5 meant I really had to try.

Thanks umberto for showing me some great moves which I will try to incorporate in my games and give my opponents a hard time.

That way its easier to understand what is going on.  jkarp:  I know what you mean by that. I used to think this way. In this case, the idea is exchanging pieces.

As there is mobility, and my Ne2, which is cramped for the moment, can move around, at a later time.  With that, the idea is also the same as what happened with Ken.  I want to make things a little more complicated for this student since he wanted to exchange.  So, the idea was taking him out of his comfort zone by refusing to give in, as Ken did with me.

And, in doing this, white gets a pawn and piece, without compensation.  That is something that I remember from my first loss against easy19, as he took my N instead of the Rook.  It boiled down to the same thing.  Which is that if he took the Rook, I'd get the B, in return, but by capturing the N, it was a free piece.  And, my Rook was not as mobile, either."

And, Janet noted what might have happened if he had done it.  The reason I find that important is because Karpov also had a lot of patience, as otherwise, he might have castled which could have ended differently.  With that being said and remembering the patience, this was played in a different attempt to liquidate.  As now, if I am to play Ne4, and he takes, it's safe for me to take back.  That's because with this move, he can't then recapture without losing his Queen.  Then, I reanalyzed and realized that there is a flaw.  For some reason, I had Ghost Vision and thought that his Bd7 was pinned, but it isn't.  Therefore, I don't bring the N to e6, as I know that he'll decline.

I told him that my response would've been 17.Qh5.  But, then his response was the fact that after Qh5, black can take, and if I retake, although it's liquidation, black would still have a fight left.  What he was really implying was that I was wrong to tell Mikko that 15...g5 was not a terrible blunder.  And, that I was wrong to threaten mate.  Instead, I should've placed him in check and then taken the Bishop.  As then, he'd have no play left.  The conversation also resumes with a similar note, but I agree with God's assessment even more.  jkarp:?? I figured that you'd play that, but this move does lose. You're right about the last move as Qh5+ would've won a piece when the K moves out. But, there, I gave you back a piece. Better was ...e6, but the best move was moving the K. It's still a bad position for black when you count being down a piece. But, by playing this, it's mate. The story is that I castled and played Qe2 as there was a threat against the monarch with the attacking force, so there was a danger there. But, recapturing overlooked that. I think the lesson to be learned after attacking my N again is to not just attack or kick a piece because it's possible to do so. Instead, look at what danger lies ahead. So, the important thing to take note of is to look out for all threats made by your opponent.

You should also remember his blitz Q sacs. What happened is that when you kicked my N, your f pawn got removed. Just remember that the f pawn is the weakest pawn on the board. So, when it advances, you're left with a vulnerable target. And, in the end, I gave you a piece, and once you took it was mate. So, the moral is to be aware of all threats made by your opponent.

Black has many options to win, and I examined two of them: 17...Bd6 and 17...Nd5. (I also looked at 17...Qd5 until realzing White's queen guards that square--so I guess in that case, taking my time did work out!) I rejected Bd6 due to 18.Qxg6 and did not play Nd5 because of 18.Bf4.

Let's take on 17...Nd5 first because it's easier to explain. I had been well aware of the f-file pin well before this move, but for some reason I completely overlooked it in the 17...Nd5 variation. It's just fine for Black to play 18...Nxf4 19.Qxf4 Rhf8. (The choice between Rdf8 and Rhf8 in these variations is a whole other question, beyond the scope of this annotation.) Instead, I thought that by attacking my queen, White would have left me with no time to enact the pin I was looking for. 

After 17...Bd6, meanwhile, 18.Qxg6 is indeed White's best response by guarding the knight on g3. However, White's king is still stalemated, so there's no time to get out of the discovered check after Rhf8 except giving up a piece by 19.Nf5 Ne4 20.Qg4 Rxf5+. (19...Ne4 threatens 20...Rxf5+ 21.Qxf5+ Qxf5+ 22.Ke3 Bc5# and if 20.Kg4 to break the pin there is a mate in 2.)

Now, it looks silly to claim I might have thought too much when those decisions are made on just a one-ply response. However, what I mean is, if I had only looked for 30 minutes, I would certainly have played 17...Bd6 or maybe 17...Nd5. Instead, I thought to the point where I found ""refutations"" to those moves that actually failed. Perhaps I needed to think about how I could reply to those ""refutations,"" and that's where extra thought should have come in. But spending hours seems like enough time. I suppose it's as important *what* you're looking at as how long you look."

The point of 17...Nxh5 was to simultaneously threaten g3, increase control over f4, and immediately prepare for the f-file pin. (I'm just now realizing the pin isn't that important anyway. If the queen flees to b3, Black must still have a withering attack on the White king, right?) Anyway, White's 20th move suddenly became painfully obvious."

No matter what I did now, in fact, I would end up in a queen-for-two-rooks situation with best play from White. Stockfish actually likes Black in the conditions of this ending, though. I assume it's do to the queen's ability to pick off a couple pawns before White's uncoordinated rooks, still on their initial squares, could get their act together."
