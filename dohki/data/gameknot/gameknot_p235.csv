1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',an unexpected counter-gambit.  It has a reasonable reputation.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White could have given Black an IQP already but I preferred to develop first.
3,0,3,Bf4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4b3/2pp4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',developing the QB outside the pawn formation.  e3 is to follow and then the KB.  6. Bg5 merely invites Black to develop a minor piece in response (...Be7 ...Ne7 or ...Nf6) and probably commits the B to swapping off.  I prefer to contest control of e5 and d6.

Black's K is still stuck in the middle so this seems more attractive than Rc1 or any pawn moves or minor piece moves.  In the ideal scenario White's KB will move to f1 and the e-pawn will advance to e5 and Black will be under pressure.

Bd2 unpinning the knight is a move which is common among amateurs who have no theoretical knowledge when they face the Nimzo-Indian. Although the move is not a bad one it is unambitious. The strategic aim of obtaining the bishop pair without conceding the doubled pawns fails for after e.g. 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4 White does not get to keep both bishops and fair trades are usually not in White's interests since White has an advantage in space."" 4. e3 4.

Rd8 is an attempt to drive it off but not a very well thought out attempt; white has a simple and obvious reply that invalidates black's move.
26,1,9,Rf8,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/8/3Bp1q1/8/1Q6/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',And now black has wasted two tempi for nothing. White's queen defends h3 now too.
27,1,10,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/8/3Bp3/8/1Q6/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',White wants to play 18. Bxb7 to win a pawn and equalize the material. Black should not reply 18. ... Bxb7 19.

Rc7 putting a third attacker on the pinned black pawn at b7. Black's 18. ... Qe7 keeps the white rook off the 7th rank and further supports f7 allowing the black rook at f8 freedom to roam if needed.
28,1,11,Bf5,b'r4rk1/pp2qppp/8/3Bpb2/8/1QR5/PP3PPP/5RK1 w - -',White is planning to double his rooks on the open c-file and invade on c7 as previously described. This was probably not black's best option abandoning the pawn at b7 to die for nothing. Maybe 19. ... Rb8 would have been better. At this point black is behind in development enough so that I'm not sure he can hold onto his extra pawn no matter what he tries here.
29,1,12,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pp2qppp/8/3Bpb2/8/1QR5/PP3PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Again denying white easy access to the 7th rank and contesting the open c-file.

31,1,14,Be6,b'1r4k1/pBR2ppp/4b3/4p3/8/8/PP3PPP/6K1 w - -',Now black wants to chase the white rook away with his king but once the black king reaches d8 white would play Rxf7 so first the bishop moves to protect f7 while simultaneously threatening a2.

Kf1 look much stronger leaving white's rook on the 7th where it would do some good. Maybe white was planning ahead to a draw and decided to play ultra conservatively.
34,1,17,f5,b'6k1/pB4pp/4b3/4pp2/8/1P6/P2r1PPP/R5K1 w - f6',White has driven his own rook back home to a1 trapped in the corner behind his pawns and no longer a threat to black. White cannot even play his pawn to a3 to unburden his rook of the defense for then black plays Bxb3. Nor can he advance the b-pawn or black will play Bxa2 or Rxa2. On the other hand the black rook is standing tall in the white camp eager to trample any and all pawns that should come his way. Black decides it's time to put his kingside pawn majority to work on the black castle.
35,1,18,Kf7,b'8/pB3kpp/4b3/4pp2/8/1P4P1/P2r1P1P/R5K1 w - -',With the help of the king.
36,1,19,Ke5,b'8/p5pp/B3b3/4kp2/4p3/1P4P1/P2r1P1P/R5K1 w - -',Black's king is getting active. With the white rook trapped in the corner it's almost as if white has a material advantage here: Rook+Bishop+4 pawns vs. Bishop + 3 pawns.
37,1,20,Bd5,b'8/p6p/8/3bkpp1/B3p3/1P4P1/P2r1P1P/R5K1 w - -',White is finally in a position to free his rook but at the cost of tying his bishop down to defense instead.
38,1,21,f4,b'8/p6p/8/3bk1p1/B3pp2/PP4P1/3r1P1P/R5K1 w - -',The black pawns are looming large.
39,1,22,e3,b'8/p6p/8/3bk1p1/BP3p2/P3p1P1/3r1P1P/R5K1 w - -',And now white has finally freed both his bishop and his rook from defending his queenside but it took 8 moves to do it (since 27. Ra1?) and now it's too late. The black pawns have invaded the white kingside and white's two defenders are still way over on the queenside. This is my second game this week decided by a pawn avalanche (the concerted advance of multiple pawns against a castled king). I'm beginning to get the hang of the power behind this tactic.
40,1,23,Rxf2,b'8/p6p/8/3bk1p1/BP3p2/P3p1P1/5r1P/4R1K1 w - -',White tried for an irritating pin preventing 36. ... exf2 but he overlooked black's powerful response.
41,1,24,gxf4,b'8/p6p/8/3bk3/BP3p2/P3p3/5r1P/4R1K1 w - -',And now black has two passed pawns supporting each other and well advanced toward their promotion.
42,1,25,Rg2+,b'8/p6p/8/1B1bk3/1P3p2/P3p3/6rP/4R1K1 w - -',Just need a little maneuvering here. It's time for white's rook to go away.
43,1,26,Rxh2,b'8/p6p/8/1B1bk3/1P3p2/P3p3/7r/4RK2 w - -',Black doesn't really want this pawn. It's harmless. But black really wants to play Rh1 and the pawn was in the way. White is already out of options. 40. Kg1??? and 40. Re2??? and 40. Be2??? all lose instantly to 40. ... Rh1#. 40. Rc1 40. Rb1 and 40. Ra1 lose the rook to 40. ... Rh1. And 40. Rd1 or any other pawn or bishop move are met with the actual continuation as played in the game.
44,1,27,Rh1+,b'8/p6p/8/1B1bk3/PP3p2/4p3/8/4RK1r w - -',White had no way out and now he will lose the rook.
45,1,28,f3+,b'8/p6p/8/1B1bk3/PP6/4pp2/4K3/4R2r w - -',If 42. Kxe3 black replies 42. ... Rxe1 43. Kf2 Rb1 and soon black will promote his f-pawn at which time white will capture Bxf1 and be recaptured leaving black with a Rook+Bishop material lead with two pawns on each side. Still white has nothing better.
46,1,29,Bb3+,b'8/p6p/8/1B2k3/PP6/1b2pp2/8/3KR2r w - -',"And now one possible continuation: 43. Kc1 (forced) Rxe1+ 44. Kb2 (forced) Kd4 (trapping the white king in the corner) 45. Kxb3 e2 46.

In fact Benko's Gambit is sometimes thought of as a Benoni.  But really Benko's Gambit is truly a separate kind of animal that deserves respect on its own.  

I generally don't play it as Black because it is difficult to win against proper play.  Playing it for drawing purposes is OK.  

Yet it is a very tricky opening.  It has great surprise value against the unprepared. Computers often make mistakes when analyzing these games."

That kind of aggressive manipulation is often attempted by both sides when strong players meet. It's a normal characteristic of the game.

The main idea here is for Black to sacrifice his a and b pawns to open up the files for his rooks."

Such a move avoids the complications that taking the extra pawn creates.  I find that this alternative is unnecessary as long as you are sufficiently familiar with the main line and the subsequent variations from it.  If 5. b6 then Black can choose between Qxb6 or e6.

****

It is strongly advised for Black to wait to retake the second pawn after 5. bxa6. For Black the sacrifice is done to gain position and speed in development.  

****

At first glance Black could retake with his rook on a8 with his knight on b8 his bishop in c8 or with his queen after a tactical finesse (Qa5+ followed by Qxa6).  Experience suggests that the only good retake is with the Bishop.  But like I said before Black should develop first.  There is no hurry in this position."

****

I've noticed however that play can continue the same by taking the a6 pawn instead with the Bishop.  But by playing g6 before retaking an unfamiliar white player is more likely to move something that will get him into trouble.  

****

Since many players are unfamiliar with the particulars of this opening 5. ...g6 is a good strategic move.  Tactically the two lines are equivalent.  "
57,2,10,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/P4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Black has already gained tempo for the sacrifice of the pawn.  Apparently pawn positions later in the game tend to favor Black too.  So White must play accurately.  Development is priority. 

Thus 6. Nc3 is sound.  A rare alternative is 6. g3; it is also playable. "
58,2,11,Bxa6,b'rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"Black has open lines for an attack. 

****

He has the potential for a devastatingly powerful lever with e6 later in the game.  An eventual c4 pawn is golden if Black can safely reach d3 with his Knight.  He can potentially do this with a knight on d7 and moving it through a vacated square on c5. Together these features can be a winning positional strategy for Black.  It's is easier said than done.  White can usually give Black back material to prevent this. However often greed gets the better of players.  

****

These are not the only ideas for Black.  He could move his f6 knight to either b5 or a4 to create a double attack with his fianchettoed bishop at g7 upon the important c3 White knight.  And/or (depending upon circumstances) the b8 knight could move through d7 and maneuver to either b4 or c4 to attack the White b pawn.  If Black can somehow succeed in gaining back the lost material by capturing either the White a or b pawn then Black should immediately trade down into an endgame.  The likely pawn structure should significantly favor Black.

****

Timing is extremely important in the Benko.  If things are coordinated just right White suddenly finds himself in a positional zugzwang.  No matter what he does his position continually deteriorates.  

But if Black does not time his movement properly then he will be the one in trouble instead."

The light squared Black bishop no longer provides pressure along the a6-f1 diagonal. Yet at the same time White will likely have weak control over the white squares.  The only way Black can exploit this weakness is through potentially awkward movements with his knights.

****

The battle for c4 and subsequent control of d3 will have to be fought by Black's knights or major pieces.  This is likely to lessen the pressure along the a and b files.  This may give White enough wiggle room to at least force a draw and perhaps launch a counter-attack upon Black's King position. "

This move prevents Ng4 where by it would provide extra support to the e5 square. More importantly 13. h3 forces Black to commit to a plan of action.  And the move also helps subdue White's weak white square problem.  

****

Black's knight on d7 currently blocks the knight on f6's preferred route of attack.  After e5 Black will not want to take.  If he does both Black's c and e pawns will be very weak.  If he does not take then the e file is opened up for the White rook.

****

It is difficult for White to time things without knowing what Black's plan of action is.

This resulting pawn structure is different than the usual favorable formation for Black in the Benko's Gambit in a couple of crucial ways.  First Black's c passed pawn is not supported by another pawn.  It is just as isolated as my 'a' pawn.  That makes it vulnerable to attack.  Second I have an advanced d pawn that can now operate as a crucial lever for White against Black!   The move d6 could easily serve as another break for White."

The last thing White wants to do is exchange the bishop for the knight on d6 while it is on d6.  That would allow the e7 pawn to support the c5 point and then White's d pawn looks weak. As is it is relatively strong.

****

Note that after the exchange Black has fewer pieces to deal with the center thrust by White's d pawn.  Fewer pieces on the board actually increase the power of this particular pawn.  Black's strategy is going to have to shift to prevent that thrust.  As is the knight is already doing exactly that.  But this in of itself leaves Black crippled when it comes to continuing a viable attack."

I thought that building an attack upon White's isolated d pawn or supporting the c pawn for potential further advancement would be more productive.

Nxc3. and now white has a clear advantage because of the advanced passed pawn that is supported. 39. Qb4 Rd5 40. Qxc3 fxe5.  And Black's prospects look bleak.  But I didn't see this.

Black has two half-open files aimed at white's castle but black's LSB is no help and his queen is far from white's kingside (even Qd8 doesn't help black much since f6 g5 and h4 are well covered by white's pawns and knight). So the castle looks reasonably safe and it connects whites rooks and allows for white to get a rook on the half-open b-file.
141,4,13,1O-O,b'2k2rr1/pp1b4/2n1pp2/q2pPn2/2pP4/2P2NP1/P1PBQPBP/R4RK1 b - -',Upon further consideration 16. exf6 may have been wiser. It allows black to double his rooks perhaps on the h-file but with his pawn removed from f7 he could do that anyway. But not capturing on f6 allows black to play fxe5 forcing white to recapture (before or after exchanging knights) with dxe5 isolating the doubled white pawns on the c-file). So positionally I think 16. exf6 might have been a better move.
142,4,14,1Rab1,b'2kq1rr1/pp1b4/2n1pp2/3pPn2/2pP4/2P2NP1/P1PBQPBP/1R3RK1 b - -',Well that was nice of black taking the pressure off the whtie queenside pawns and allowing white to play Rab1 instead of Rfb1 saving the kingside rook for better things like support on the e-file if needed.
143,4,15,1Rxb7,b'2k2rr1/pR1b4/2n1pq2/3pNn2/2pP4/2P3P1/P1PBQPBP/5RK1 b - -',"18. ... Qf6? is a bit of a blunder for black (do you see it without reading ahead?) allowing white to gain material and a strong queenside attack against the black king. I believe his intent was for his queen to support 19. ... Nxe5 which will do a lot of damage to white's pawn structure. As for 19. Rxb7?! I don't know how to score this move so I think I'll give it the old ""strange move"" notation. White could have played 19. Nxd7 forking black's queen and rook and forcing black to recapture with 19. ... Kxd7 after which 20. Rxb7+ wins a pawn and gets white a rook on the 7th rank. Then I realized I could reverse the order and win a rook bishop and pawn for a rook and knight. As played it exchanges more material which is good when white is ahead by two soon to be three pawns. But it loses the advantage of a rook on the 7th rank. Still it felt more fun more ""shock and awe"" which I needed after my earlier cowardly queen retreat."
144,4,16,2dxe5,b'2k2rr1/pR1b4/4pq2/3pPn2/2p5/2P3P1/P1PBQPBP/5RK1 b - -',Black scared me with 19. Nxe5 which frankly I had not considered. At first I thought I had blown it since without the knight there is no Nxe7 to fork the queen and rook and I will lose my rook for just a pawn or retreat the rook and lose the knight for nothing. Then I realized that 20. dxe5 threatens black's queen and gives white's rook a chance to escape.

White cannot drive black's king farther away than e8 which still defends the black bishop and allows for black to play Rg7 defending the bishop even more. So 24. Rb1b7 wouldn't get me what I want. What I need is to get the LSB from g2 all the way over to where it can attack the black bishop. If only the black pawn on d5 would go away... Then I realized I could just hunt the d5 pawn instead; make it go away rather than just wish it would.

Ba3+ serves very little purpose and just wastes time but it doesn't hurt either and it adds an extra piece to white's mounting attack against the black king.
150,4,22,2Bxd5,b'3r2r1/R2b1k2/1R2p1q1/3BP3/2p4n/B1P3P1/P1P1QP1P/6K1 b - -',The black pawn at e6 is pinned: 26. ... exd5? allows 27. Rxg6 and white gains a queen and pawn for a bishop and rook. But if black doesn't capture the pressure with white's bishop and rook attacking the pawn on e6 is difficult to defend against and white always has Qxc4 and Bc6. Faced with multiple threats and an overwhelming material deficit black resigns.

Another futile duel with Freddy.  This time he kicks off with yet another unusual opening - 1. h4.  At one stage I end up being 2 pawns up but with my kingside pawn structure it was only a matter of time before Freddy harvested the pawns like ripe apples.  Material was even for most of the game and even when I went behind I tried to make something out of the position.  Alas the queenside became a death trap for poor ole King Henry.  Freddy crowned a pawn and on the next move delivered the coup de grace with a knight."

1. Capture the attacking piece
2. Move out of check
3. Block it with one of your pieces.

1. Move out of check?

What would you do?  Think on this long and hard... there's a great lesson to be learned here.

If he moves Rf7 White can capture the Rook with either his Knight or his Queen...but if White takes the Black Rook with his Knight Black can take White's Queen with Rxd5.. so THAT's not going to happen; if he takes the Rook with his Queen White's Knight is protecting the White Queen at f7 Black's King is in check and BLACK IS DOWN A FULL ROOK.

It contained my  first game in the Belgian inter-club competition. The game itself also originated in a basement so truly a case of ""Cellar Chess""! The cause of this unusual playing venue was an administrative oversight: Our club (KGSRL) was at that time the largest club of Belgium and brought 13 teams to the inter-club competition. The request to have only half of the teams play at home on any competition day was not taken into account in the schedule and so some 130 players came together in the clubhouse when we played home. The teams in first division played upstairs and the teams from the lowest echelons had to play in the cellar... Best of were the guys playing in 4th division: they got to play in the bar.

Ne6 - the pawn on d6 cannot be taken because if I do then Henry will certainly be taken by Old Matey dropping onto e8 - beware of the long range white lsb controlling h7!  This knight move prepares the possibility of the capture on d6.

Rxd6 - I decide to remove the d pawn - I did analyse the board and thought that I could not hold onto both my queenside pawns.  As a result I offered my opponent a draw.  Ion however thought that I could have held onto my a pawn and gradually nursed it up the board so let's throw in a Bad Draw Offer folks!  I lost 1.9 rating points as a result of the low draw but maybe after the way I played I was very lucky the loss wasn't 11.9!
481,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  I am black in this game of my 1700-1800 mini-tournament and I end up having an early bath.  I merely follow the database but my opponent tries to hold on to his extra pawn with great cost as you will see.  My opponent's rating at the time was 1674 so even an intermediate player can blunder his queen!
482,18,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',2. Nc3 - the Vienna Opening - this is a versatile opening and can transpose into quite a few openings including the Bishop's Opening which starts with Bc4 instead of Nc3.
483,18,2,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. g3 - white has played the Vienna Opening with 2. Nc3 and now plays an unusual g3.  This is another way to support the e4 pawn.
484,18,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2Np2P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',6. ...... Nc6 - I could play dxc2 but Nc6 is a good move because it develops a piece.  Also if white takes the pawn on d6 white's extra pawn is doubled.
485,18,4,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1n2P3/2NP2P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',7. ...... Nb4 - as recommended in the database.  The pawn on d3 will fall giving me a very favourable position.

I looked at the board to see why he had done this and saw that I will net the Wicked Witch of the West and his rook on a1 into the bargain!  No wonder he resigned without waiting for my reply.  White is no beginner in fact his current rating is 1800+ and he is top of the 1700-1800 tournament table as I write.  
487,19,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk to you about chess blunders.  Don't we all get that horrid sinking feeling when we have made a blunder.  Well thankfully it was my opponent that blundered.  I got into my usual jstevens1 type position and the disease passivitis struck again - incredibly my 1700+ opponent failed to take full advantage and later on he made a serious oversight which brought about instant resignation - well less talk - more action.  After getting used to the Sicilian Defense I find myself fronted with the French.
488,19,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1...... e6 - voila!  This is the French Defense.  The purpose of this move is to support d5.  If pawns are exchanged on d5 you get the Exchange Variation where black has a pawn controlling e4 and c4.
489,19,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2....... Nf6 - unusual.

493,19,6,1Kxf2,b'r3k2r/1b1n1ppp/p1n1p3/1p1pP3/1P3P2/P1NB1N2/2P2KPP/R6R b kq -',15. Kxf2 - after a bit of expansion on the queenside the queens are exchanged.  There are a few surprises in this quiet position and for me not very pleasant.  I am about to cede control of the c file.
494,19,7,Rc3,b'7r/1b1nkp1p/p3p1p1/1p1pP3/1P1N1P2/P1rB4/2P2KPP/2R4R w - -',19....... Rc3 - nasty nasty the pawn on a3 is hanging so my rook has to go back to a1.  In retrospect my king rook should have gone to c1 instead of my queen rook.
495,19,8,Na4,b'2r5/1b2kp1p/p3p1p1/1p1pP3/nP1N1P2/PRrB4/2P2KPP/R7 w - -',22........ Na4 - now in comes his horsie.

Ra3 - I decided to initiate the exchange of pawns myself and to counter-attack with my rook down the newly opened a file threatening a skewer on a7.  Black moves his king to d6 so that if Ra7 Kc7.  I now play my knight to c3 and wait for it ........
505,19,18,Kc6,b'8/1b5p/2k3p1/1p6/1Pp5/R1N1K1P1/2P4P/3r4 w - -',37....... Kc6?? - now!  The rook on d1 is en prise!  My horsie says thank you very much.  I had to wait 2 or 3 days for my opponent to come on line again.  It was worth waiting for because I bagged 9 lucky points!  To date in my 1700-1800 mini-tourney I have 7 points out of 9 games.

Now I am trying to rid myself of the disease Passivitis but guess what?  In trying to do so I invite the very thing that I am trying to avoid.

I start off with 1. g3.  I remember the last time I played g3 against an Expert who is now Master Heinzkat and see if I have learnt anything from it......

Bxd5+ - I do not like this - with Freddy having a lsb and the Wicked Witch of the West that is certainly a cauldron of trouble for King Henry - but what was the alternative.  If I did not take the knight then surely it would hop on to c3 threatening my rook on d1.  If the rook then moved to d2 then it could quite easily be skewered by Bg5!  So I hope that I will be able to defend my 2nd rank adequately agains the Wicked Witch.

Black had a scare there losing a pawn but he quickly got it back and now things look fairly even. The openness of the position seems to favor black's bishop a little more than white's knight and black has only one isolated pawn to white's two. Minor advantages to be sure and I have little idea how to exploit them. So I started by putting another attacker on white's isolated pawn at c3.

This game had been close and well played by both sides such that I almost regretted playing black's final move.

Besides this game concludes a St. Patrick's Day hat trick - three wins on the holiday.

It starts out with a Bird's Opening 1.f4 and transposes into a King's Gambit.

	I played this game more than 40 years ago when theory of chess openings was measured in reams of paper not gigabytes. No matter how it is measured opening theory is nothing more than a compilation of some but never all the idiotic garbage spiced with some nice gems there and here in rare corners of the ocean of mixture of slime that was played by players who thought much more about what they were doing than whoever compiled the theory. There is so much richness in the uncounted trillions of possibilities that no chess player can hope to memorize enough to cover even a limited area. And by trying to specialize in memorized openings woodpushers (even titled and high-rated woodpushers) blind themselves to new and creative ideas.
	7...Nf6 is an important innovation which even now is rarely if ever played. One point aside from offering the b7-pawn is that white now has no time for Bg5 which is otherwise a main response to 7...Nc6.

The value of pieces is relative to the position. White's knight and light squared bishop are worth more than black's queen.

[Filipp Frenkel comments: 	People are thrilled by exceptions rather than by rules. Imagine: a pawn is worth one dollar a knight $3.25 a bishop $3.50 a rook $5.30 a queen $10.30 and the king is priceless. Chess is a mirror of life and the prices of goods change. Now the price of white's knight and bishop is higher than black's queen.

	It's known that three pieces can often overplay a queen positionally even in the absence of some combination which regains the queen. Sacrifice of queen for only two pieces is much rarer and more spectacular- looking. I had seen this idea before in some few other games and the pattern had suggested itself to me once 12. a3 revealed white's intentions. Queen for two pieces is really only the equivalent of sacrificing a piece and we do know often enough the value of sacrificing a piece. ]

782,35,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Caro-Kann Defense main line reply for white.
783,35,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Well I'm already stumped. I don't find an opening in the Caro-Kann or the French Defense that has blacks first two moves as c6 and e6 in either order. White responds by developing.
784,35,3,Bd3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White is just continuing to develop and tempting black to exchange on c3. White isn't worried about doubled pawns on the c-file because with all the center pawns still in the game it should be fairly easy to undouble the c-file via exchanges in the center.
785,35,4,Bd2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2ppp3/q7/3PP3/2PB1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Black wastes no time trying to attack the doubled white pawns but they're easy enough to defend at the moment. Of note is the fact that white is castled with three developed pieces and a stronger presence in the center while by comparison black has only developed his queen.
786,35,5,c4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2ppp3/q7/2PPP3/3B1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Pushing into the center with an eye toward undoubling the c-pawns with the gain of tempo by discovering an attack against the black queen by the white bishop on d2.
787,35,6,1Rb1,b'r1b1k1nr/ppqn1ppp/2ppp3/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/P1PB1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',White parks a rook on the half-open b-file. Doesn't look like it will have much to do for  awhile other than preventing black from playing a pawn to b5.

790,35,9,1cxd6,b'r1b1k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pP1n1p/4p3/3PP3/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',No more doubled pawns.

Also e5 is just a little too defended at the moment. This move defends the bishop solving half of the problem. The other half is up to black though I have little hope that he'll move his knight off of d7.
792,35,11,1Nh4,b'r1b2rk1/pp1n1pp1/2pq1n1p/4p3/3PP2N/2PB4/P1QB1PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',I don't really want my knight on the edge of the board but I do want to play the pawn to f4. Black could play 15. ... exd4 to try to win a pawn but 16. Nf5 threatens black's queen and drives her off of the d-file so white can play 17. cxd4 and prevent the loss of the pawn.
793,35,12,1f4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/1npq1n1p/4p3/3PPP1N/2PB4/P1QB2PP/1R3RK1 b - f3',Great now black moves the knight I wanted him to move earlier now when 16. dxe5 is not supported and doesn't win a piece. Black can't play 16. ... exf4? because that allows 17. e5 winning the black knight.

795,35,14,1Nf5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qpp1/1np4p/4PN1n/3PP3/2PB4/P1QB2PP/1R3RK1 b - -',The knight was under attack this move saves it with a tempo unless black wants to exchange pieces while he's a pawn down.
796,35,15,1exf5,b'r4rk1/pp2qpp1/1np4p/4PP1n/3P4/2PB4/P1QB2PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Black's castle is looking a bit exposed now. And his knight on h5 has no safe moves. His other knight on b6 is far removed from the white attack against black's castle. It's time to mobilize.
797,35,16,2Qb3+,b'r4rk1/pp2q1p1/1np2p1p/4PP1n/3P4/1QPB4/P2B2PP/1R3RK1 b - -',To create a passed pawn on e6.

799,35,18,2g4,b'1r3r1k/pp2q1p1/1np1Pp1p/5P1n/3P2P1/1QPB4/P2B3P/1R3RK1 b - g3',Wins the black knight on h5 since he has nowhere to go. Black could try 22. ... g6. He still loses a knight but he can kick white's supporting f5 pawn leaving the advanced e6 pawn feeling rather lonely up there. Or he could try 22. ... Qe8 looking to recapture on h5 from where she can support 24. ... g6. But no matter what white will win the knight and will still have a fairly powerful attack on black's kingside. Rather than try to weather that storm black chose to resign at this point. To me it seemed a bit early since he's only a piece down but maybe he saw a continuation from here that I haven't yet found.
800,36,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi everyone - this was an unrated game between me and one of my buddies who has an optimum rating in the high 1600s.  He played very well until his last move but that last move was fatal and allowed an incursion of Glenda onto the back rank.  My opponent resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate in 3.  Please note.  I do NOT mind if my opponents wish to resign rather than be checkmated.  Nice just to get the points.  I decide to kick off with d4.
801,36,1,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ -',4. ....... 0-0 early castling.

804,36,4,1bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/8/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',11. bxc3 - extra pawn but my queenside pawns are shattered and could drop off at any time.

806,36,6,Qxc5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2q1n3/8/P3PP2/4BP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',15. ...... Qxc5 - as predicted my queenside pawns duly drop off.
807,36,7,1Qb3,b'2r2rk1/pp2qppp/5n2/4n3/8/PQ2PP2/1B2BP1P/R4RK1 b - -',19. Qb3 - Glenda moves onto the b file putting pressure on b3.  Black prepares to double rooks on the c file and I now challenge the c file.
808,36,8,Rxc7,b'6k1/ppr1qppp/5n2/4n3/8/PQ2PP2/1B2BP1P/5RK1 w - -',21. Rxc7 - a rook trade.
809,36,9,2f4,b'6k1/ppr1qppp/2n2n2/8/5P2/PQ2P3/1B2BP1P/2R3K1 b - -',23. f4 - preparing Bb5 in order to either force a rook swap or break up black's united queenside pawns.
810,36,10,Ne4,b'6k1/ppr1qppp/2n5/8/4nP2/PQ2P3/1B2BP1P/2R3K1 w - -',25. ....... Ne4 - the black knight finds an outpost on e4 and breaks a threefold repetition.  If my opponent had a crystal ball I think he would have played into it!
811,36,11,2Rxc7,b'6k1/ppR1qppp/5n2/nB6/5P2/PQ2PP2/1B5P/6K1 b - -',28. Rxc7 - the swap.
812,36,12,Qb6,b'6k1/pp3ppp/1q3n2/nB6/5P2/P1Q1PP2/1B5P/6K1 w - -',29. ....... Qb6?? - this move allows a fatal incursion of Glenda onto c8.  She moves onto c8 with the greatest of glee.  It is now mate in 3.  My opponent waves the white flag. This leaves the lesson watch your back rank!
813,36,13,3Qc8+,b'2Q3k1/pp3ppp/1q3n2/nB6/5P2/P3PP2/1B5P/6K1 b - -',
814,37,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I'm generally a cautious-minded player and this is my favorite opening.
815,37,1,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The game has progressed very quickly up to this point in terms of real time. We haven't used much more than a minute each. But things slow down afterwards.
816,37,2,Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',By now the symmetry is getting frustrating. I take a while to look for clever ideas and seriously consider plotting on the assumption that my opponent will mimic me. That doesn't lead me to any useful lines of thought though so I try to station my rook on a file somewhat likely to be open up. But at the rate things are going I don't expect a lot of action any time soon.
817,37,3,Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np3p/2b1p2n/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',"I was wrong. ""Knights on the rim are grim (and/or dim)"" the maxim goes. This surprises me and I look for a way to turn it into an advantage."

Otherwise Black has to retreat the knight which is also not a great idea at this stage in the game. Though I suppose I could have pushed the g-pawn to harass it...
820,37,6,1Qxh5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Moving my queen to the fifth rank on my tenth move was decidedly not part of my plan prior to the game. It had been a long day however and my cautiousness had eventually been supplanted by the knowledge that my opponents are just as capable as me at making mistakes. It was a watershed realization.
821,37,7,1g6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/2n3pp/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I'm not sure my opponent meant to do this but touch-move was in effect.
822,37,8,Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/2n2qpQ/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I'm feeling pretty good about my position at this point and don't really think about what my opponent might be up to.

Nevertheless this proves to be a useful square for my knight to occupy. I'm anything but conscious of that at the time though.
824,37,10,1Qxf2+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/2n3pQ/2bNp3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPP2qP1/R1B1R1K1 w - -',And just when I was on a somewhat uncharacteristic attack the momentum of the game changes drastically.

826,37,12,Qg1+,b'r4rk1/ppp2p2/2n1b1pQ/2bNp3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPP1R1PK/R1B3q1 w - -',I think either this or the next move was written down incorrectly but I'm pretty sure this is how it happened. I remember feeling safe from imminent defeat because I knew the pawn could serve as a buffer.
827,37,13,1Kg3,b'r4rk1/ppp2p2/2n1b1pQ/2bNp3/2B1P3/3P2KP/PPP1R1P1/R1B3q1 b - -',Thanks little guy!

I'd like to think that I'm being clever here but there's some miscalculation involved--I think I forgot that capturing the bishop would give check. Nevertheless this provides yet another juicy target (the rook on a1) and stands between the queen and the magical f6 square.
830,37,16,Be7+,b'r4rk1/ppp1bp2/2n1b1pQ/3N4/2B1Pp1K/3P3P/PPP1R1P1/R4q2 w - -',I don't realize that this is check and search the board for a long time before seeing the obvious Rxf1. As I grab my rook my opponent notifies me of the check. Thankfully the rook has no legal moves!

But I knew I wouldn't give up even in this position and began brainstorming how I'd fight back. And just as I was thinking ""move a rook to d8"" the move came. Move-mirroring indeed."
833,37,19,2dxc4,b'r2r2k1/ppp1np2/6pQ/8/2P1PR1K/7P/PPP1R1P1/8 b - -',I'm hoping eventually to play Ref2 followed by Rxf7 and Qh7#.
834,37,20,2Rdf8,b'r4rk1/ppp1np2/6pQ/8/2P1PR1K/7P/PPP1R1P1/8 w - -',But my opponent also sees this idea.
835,37,21,2Ref2,b'r4rk1/ppp1np2/6pQ/8/2P1PR1K/7P/PPP2RP1/8 b - -',I press on though; trading off rooks is to my advantage at this point.
836,37,22,2f5,b'r4rk1/ppp1n3/6pQ/5p2/2P1PR1K/7P/PPP2RP1/8 w - f6',This is actually a fairly good square for one of my opponent's pieces to occupy though that's not the piece.
837,37,23,2Rd2,b'r4rk1/ppp1n3/6pQ/5p2/2P1PR1K/7P/PPPR2P1/8 b - -',However I can now try for Rd7 Rxe7 and Qh7#.
838,37,24,2fxe4,b'r4rk1/ppp1n3/6pQ/8/2P1pR1K/7P/PPPR2P1/8 w - -',This frees up f5 for the knight to fork. The good news is I see that threat coming and try to move my pieces so they're not forked their. Should I move the queen? Nah she's pretty useful where she is. I'll move the king!
839,37,25,2Kg3,b'r4rk1/ppp1n3/6pQ/8/2P1pR2/6KP/PPPR2P1/8 b - -',...The bad news is I don't think about this very hard.

845,38,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',After reading an impressive game here on Gameknot I decided to adopt the same approach a Sicilian with colours reversed.  This abandons my habitual King's Indian response so I'm in new territory here.  My recent opening experiments have been unsuccessful so fingers are well and truly crossed.
846,38,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The most successful Black move in this position according to the database not that I have much faith in the statistics therein.  Too often I choose what looks like the most successful line only to discover that my opponent chooses a continuation that gives him a much higher winning percentage...
847,38,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Black has castled in only four moves.  Now he cna concentrate on attacking White's relatively undeveloped position.
848,38,4,Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N3P1/PPQPPPBP/R1B1K1NR b KQ -',Avoids doubled pawns if Black decides to swap on c3 and develops the Q which eyes h7 but does nothing to help the King castle.
849,38,5,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N3P1/PPQPPPBP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',Lining up behind the e-pawn with a longer-term view at hitting the King or the KN if it comes to f3 in a normal developing move.
850,38,6,Nc6,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1bP5/2N2NP1/PPQPPPBP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',deprives White's KN of the d4 square

852,38,8,e4,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/8/1bP1p3/2N2NP1/PPQPPPBP/R1BR2K1 w - -',forcing the N either to retreat to d1 or to the rim on h4
853,38,9,Bxc3,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/8/2P1p3/2b3P1/PPQPPPBP/R1BRN1K1 w - -',The pawn on e4 was attacked by three pieces and only defended by two so this move removes one of the attackers and diverts one of the others.
854,38,10,Nd4,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/7p/3n4/3np3/6P1/PPQPPPBP/R1BRN1K1 w - -',Forks the Q and the pawn on e2 which cannot be defended.  White's back row is in disarray and Black's knights are dominating the whole board.
855,38,11,Qf6,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/5q1p/3n4/4p3/6P1/PP1PnPBP/RQBRN2K w - -',and White had had enough.
856,39,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A short and tought game in which my opponent probably thinks that he has a strong attack and in few moves gets in trouble. I like to win but I won't like to be in his skin. 
857,39,1,f5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p2p1/3n1p2/3P2P1/2P2NBP/PP2PP2/RN1QKB1R w KQ f6',I like his plan till far. When I took this pawn I wasn't sure at all it was a good idea and prepared myself to defend trying to expell his white bishop from the strong position it will get.
858,39,2,1Nh4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5b2/3P3N/2P3BP/PP1NPP2/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Luckily I found that the symmetric move for him Nh5 wouldn't be as good for him as for me. He apparently didn't thought the same and played it. 
859,39,3,1Bh4,b'rn1q2k1/ppp1p1bp/3p2p1/5r1n/3P3B/2P4P/PP1NPP2/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Now I spent a lot calculating his Rf4 and my Bg5. You see it seems that f2 is weak black has the open f column and two pieces into the attack and easily the queen can go to f8... nevertheless the white position is not as weak as it seem and there is no real danger if I play with care. The trick is not to take away the bishop from the f2-h4 diagonal. His move would have been g5! to which I would have played e4...
860,39,4,1Qb3+,b'rn3qk1/ppp1p1bp/3p2p1/5r1n/3P3B/1QP4P/PP1NPP2/R3KB1R b KQ -',Oooopss...

862,39,6,Rxf2,b'rn3q1k/ppp1p1bp/3p2p1/6Bn/3PP3/1QP4P/PP1N1r2/R3KB1R w KQ -',Well f2 seems very tasteful but...
