22 Qh4?? Nf3+ wins.  On the 22 Qh6 and 22 Qg2 lines 22 ... f3 leads to material gain for black.  the main things which had to be worked out were the correct way of recapturing on f3.  In terms of tactical details the possibility of bxc5 for white and Bxa1 for black had to be figured out.  In some lines white winds up a rook down.  In the line he chose in the game (which was best) he wound up down a piece for two pawns.

9,0,9,Bb5,b'r5k1/2n1q2p/p4rp1/1bN1p3/1P2PPP1/P3Q3/7P/3R1RK1 w - -',this required a lot of work.  The point of this move was to force the rook off of f1 and bar that square to the other rook.  This is important in lines where white can play Rxf6 and black must be able to reply Qxf6 not having to worry about a Rf1 by white if black has played ... Kf8 in response to a queen check.  Whether black can force a win at this point is in question particularly if most of the pieces come off the board and white has a rook left at that point.

First and foremost my biggest thanks to hityerclock for commenting on my annotations. Next I just don't know what has been happening to my game lately.  I have been falling for a rash of one move blunders lately and this game has been one of them although I was lost the previous move.  This game started off as a Sicilian Dragon type game with both sides castling on opposite sides white on the queenside and black on the kingside.  We are in the book for quite a while before I decided to challenge rooks on the c column.  Black then threw me a curve with a piece for 2 pawn sac which proved decisive later on.  So how did all this happen well read on.  Gameknot analysis is provided here. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16090381&rnd=0.8934997643125019"

Na4 - black does not like this move - here are his comments:-  15.Na4 was a mistake on your part as that N is now out of play and in fact allows Bxa4 displacing the pawn on b3 with one move and giving me counter-play. Better would have been retreating to e2 where it supports the one on d4 and can swing in to f4 or g3 to help with the attack and also forcing me to use two moves (a5/a4) to dislodge the b3 pawn if I want to press my attack. When each side is attacking on an opposite wing like this tempo is very important."" - but it seems to be book."

Here is what he said in his post-match pm. ""The GK computer doesn't seem to like my Nxe4 sacrifice and indicates that it gives white an edge but I disagree. I think it's black's best attempt to punish white for Rc1. I get at least two pawns for the N the two bishops become very active and white has king safety issues. 

This is clear positional compensation for the material and in my (admittedly biased) opinion white no longer winning chances after that.""

Black is having none of it and just moves his king to g7.  In order to enable Glenda to do this Henry decided to defend the pinned knight on e1.  Unfortunately he could be checked away from that square by the evil witch.

However I feel that it was only a matter of time before black uses one of those black passers on the kingside to resurrect the evil one's sister the Wicked Witch of the East and both those besoms would make Henry's life sheer hell on earth.  There was only one thing to do wave that bally (as Coach Ion would say!) white flag.

287,12,21,Nxb4,b'5k2/ppp2p1p/6p1/2Pp4/Pn2b3/4P1KP/6P1/R7 w - -',29. ..... Nxb4 - those queenside pawns that I had been talking about in my notes a few moves back are certainly not secure.  In fact they are totally shattered.  Delta also feels well and truly shattered and waves the white flag at this point and my rating goes back into the 1780s.  Now all I need are a few more of these results to get me around that precious Class A watermark.
288,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I'll skip over the first few moves as the game only really deters from common practice of this  opening at move nine.
289,13,1,h5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1p1/2k5/2p3Np/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ h6',And here we have the point of this game. I had shortly before playing this played another of these games where I won using this move and easy19 challenged me to this game to show me the correct way that white should respond to this move.
290,13,2,1Bf5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1p1/2k5/2p2BNp/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',by far the best move here. It keeps white playing actively as well as keeping the pieces in touch with each other.
291,13,3,1e5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp4p1/2k5/2p1pBNp/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ e6',A very poor choice by me. I even new that this is a bad move in this opening but for some reason I seemed to be under the impression that having played h5 somehow changes that. God only knows why I thought that.
292,13,4,1Nf7,b'rn1q1b1r/pp3Np1/1k6/2p1p2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',At first glance it appears white is getting greedy and only seeking the fork of the queen and h rook. In reality White is only using this square as a stopping station to get to a much better square (Being e5)
293,13,5,1Qe7,b'rn3b1r/pp2qNp1/1k6/2p1p2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',? again I think a poor choice of moves. For some reason I seemed to think white might play Nxh8 then I could follow up with exf4. really all this does is misplace my queen and block in my own DSB.
294,13,6,Nc6,b'r4b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn5/2p1N2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',it is here I began getting glimpses of how bad my position really was. I began to realised the potential of forks  knowing full well that White would play Nc3! the move I just made is still good seeking to trade off even if it cant do so yet.
295,13,7,1Nc3,b'r4b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn5/2p1N2p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',! as I said black would like to play Nxc5 but because of the fork threat it is impossible.
296,13,8,1Ng6,b'3r1b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn3N1/2p4p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',white has good piece co-ordination and realises that this move takes advantage of blacks lack of piece of coordination.
297,13,9,1f5,b'3r1b1r/pp4p1/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/4B3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',cements the knight in place.

299,13,11,1Rh7,b'5b2/pp4pr/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',poor move but I could not think of any better. Having played Qf6 my queen is still vulnerable to king/queen forks. I would have liked to play Rxe4 but unfortunately the rook needs to stay on the d file to guard against Nd5+
300,13,12,1d3,b'5q2/pp4pr/1kn5/2p2P1p/3rB3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',White is suddenly looking very very good. I'm afraid to say it just got even worse from here. I think I probably should have taken this opportunity to rid myself of whites annoying bishop.
301,13,13,Rd6,b'5q1r/pp4p1/1knr4/2p2P1p/4B3/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',makes my earlier Rd4 just look silly. Best here was most likely Qd8.
302,13,14,2b4,b'5q1r/pp4p1/1knr4/2p2P1p/1P2B3/2NPB3/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - b3',And this is where my opponent said in chat OK here we go... I could see I was in a heck of a lot of trouble. anyone could see white is dictating this game. and has most pieces all in position for the attack.
303,13,15,Kxc5,b'5q1r/pp4p1/2n5/2k2P1p/3rB3/2NPB3/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - -',Qxc5?? Na4+
304,13,16,a6,b'5q1r/1p6/p1n2p2/2k4p/3rB3/2NPB3/P1P3PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Done to prevent the rook nestling in on b5.
305,13,17,2Bxd4,b'7r/1p2q3/p2k1p2/5R1p/3BB3/3P4/P1P3PP/1R4K1 b - -',black can almost wave the white flag here. it's good practice though to play losing positions besides black still has pieces left on the board.
306,13,18,Ke8,b'2r1k3/1p2q3/pR3p2/3R3p/3BB3/3P4/P1P3PP/6K1 w - -',Harbouring faint hopes that white might play something like Bf3. But alas no Freddy did not wish to lose this encounter. maybe next time :P 
307,13,19,Kg8,b'2r3k1/1p2q3/p4RB1/3R3p/3B4/3P4/P1P3PP/6K1 w - -',Perhaps he will move his rook off the file?
308,13,20,3Rxh5,b'2r3k1/1p2q3/p4RB1/7R/3B4/3P4/P1P3PP/6K1 b - -',Next few moves are just me making futile attempts to prolong the game an extra move or two.
309,13,21,3Rh8#,b'5k1R/1p6/p1r2BB1/8/8/3P4/P1P3PP/5K2 b - -',A good game to play despite my absolutely atrocious playing. I believe I learned alot though and am sure if I played one of these queen sac games again I would have a much better understanding of the type of unique play these games require.
310,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This guy busted me up pretty bad I need to figgure out how...

312,14,2,d3,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p1Pb2/2Bp4/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White has played well but looks over extended.  I'm thinking Na4 to pressure White's Bishop.

322,15,1,Qf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',This move is probably indicative of me being underestimated. (Probably because my name is misspelled =).

326,15,5,Qg3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P2b1/2NB2Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ -',Another tempo down and poorly placed here due to Nf6's lust for the e4 square.

This was probably played because my opponent thought I would take Be2 (bad idea because he would have played Bxf6 and I would have had to honor his threat of checkmate thus losing the initiative back to him.

338,16,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A standard opening. Me as black. This was a must win game for me to stay in the tournement so I put in a huge amount of thinking time

I intended it to happen very soon but I did not want to make a single mistake so spent a few moves removing all my weakness.

I also see the white knight moving to g4 after i move bxh3. This would attack my bishop and open then queens path to move onto the kings side. h6 prevents this.
351,16,13,1a5,b'r4rk1/pp1q1pp1/2ppbn1p/P3p3/2P1P3/1PB2N1P/2P2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',I don't know what white was doing here but I was thankful for it.

I was really pleased with my flat pawn wall holding up everything. The wall was controlling key squares and could not be broken up as white had a locked pawn and a doubled pawn.

If white moves his g pawn out to kick me off it leaves his h pawn very vunerable. My main thought was that he has to move his queen now giving me a bishop and a knight attack on the h pawn. (Why it was so important for me to free my knight of defensive duty).

Jim Friar got some revenge over me for publishing his loss against Delta the Master Blaster.  Sadly I was unable to match Delta's stellar performance but I thought this game would be worthy of annotation because it can throw up a thread of which is better.  Q or 2 rooks.  In this game the Wicked Witch of the West won hands down!  She was aided by a very rampant steed though.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here to help you follow this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15882901&fb=1&rnd=0.3066320580432481.  Jim starts off the game with 1.

549,22,12,2Nb1,b'r1b2rk1/pp4q1/2p1n1p1/3p1pP1/8/1P1Q1B2/P1P1PP2/1NKR3R b - -',20. Nb1 - that knight is really innocuous but that is the one that will be the death of Henry later on.

This leaves me one point up in material but there is big trouble ahead.  I am very weak on the dark squares and the downside is - rooks do not move diagonally so they cannot do very much even collectively.

However I analysed the alternatives and knew that I would be faced with ruinous loss of material.  Gameknot Analysis confirmed that I would have been the equivalent of a Q down with the alternative it suggested so I did save myself some the bother of typing out a resignation note and gave Jim the satisfaction of putting me in checkmate.  Have any of you been faced with Q v 2 rooks and what was the outcome?  I will now start that thread .....

669,27,33,Qg7,b'r1b1k2r/p2p2q1/3Pp3/1Bp1Np2/Q7/R5Pp/7P/3KR3 w kq -',He insists in not playing Rh7 the best way to defend d7. Now Nc6 is playable (dxN Qxc6+ winning the rook. But Qd4+ was in the middle. Bc6 is also possible for the same reason but Rb8 and I have to worry about Rb1+ so...
670,27,34,Rh7,b'r1b1k3/p2p2qr/3Pp3/1Bp1Np2/Q7/2R3Pp/7P/3KR3 w q -',Ah now...
671,27,35,f4,b'r1b1k3/p2p2qr/3Pp3/1BR1N3/Q4p2/6Pp/7P/3KR3 w q -',A good try (the only one!). Of course Qxf4 holds and wins as gxf but... could I be more brilliant?
672,27,36,3Bc6,b'r1b1k3/p2p2qr/2BPp3/2R1N3/Q5P1/5p1p/7P/3KR3 b q -',Rb8 would have been a good answer. Bxf3 Rb1+ but now the knight is defended by the other rook.
673,27,37,3f2,b'r1b1k3/p2p2qr/2BPp3/2R1N3/Q5P1/7p/5p1P/3KR3 w q -',Defending? Never! :-)
674,27,38,3Bxa8,b'B1b1k3/p2p2qr/3Pp3/2R1N3/Q5P1/7p/5p1P/3KR3 b - -',So he has run out of tricks. RxB is mate. 
675,27,39,3Kxe1,b'B1b1k3/p2p2qr/3Pp3/2R1N3/Q5P1/7p/7P/4K3 b - -',And he resigned (well for timeout). I didn't play well but I was lucky. And maybe somebody can see why to NOT play h5-h4 if you are not a very good player. 
676,28,0,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',By the book so far.

686,28,10,Qd2,b'6k1/p2r2pp/4bp2/2p5/8/1P1nP1P1/P1Nq1PBP/RQ4K1 w - -',Looking to mount a direct attack against the King and force a mate or decisive material gain. Note that White is horribly cramped with no piece beyond the second rank or Pawn beyond the third. The *attack* is the way to exploit an opponent's cramped position.
687,28,11,Qxf2+,b'6k1/p2r2pp/4bp2/2p5/8/NP1nP1P1/P4qBP/RQ4K1 w - -',Forcing the King to the corner.

693,28,17,Bg4,b'3R4/p4kpB/5p2/2p5/6b1/NP2q1P1/P6P/7K w - -',White overlooks the mating threat and I move my B into position.

695,28,19,Bf3#,b'3R2B1/p5p1/5pk1/2p5/2N5/1P2qbP1/P6P/7K w - -',And that's a wrap.
696,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game features a pleasing rook sac. In my analysis during the game I thought it would lead to a level endgame but I was equally convinced that Jim my opponent would not find his way through the complications and would lose. I was delighted to be proved right and equally delighted that post-match analysis showed that the sacrifice didn't actually lead to a level ending but in fact won in all variations.
697,29,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So standard Sicilian

701,29,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black more-or-less has to take
702,29,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And he recaptures rather than gambit with c3
703,29,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I put pressure on the e pawn.

706,29,10,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',He plays the Richter-Rauzer Attack
707,29,11,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',and I continue with the most popular
708,29,12,Qd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',he keeps to the books.
709,29,13,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Black rules out a white knight landing on b5 and prepares the b7-b5 thrust

713,29,17,b5,b'r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1nppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq b6',So I continue with the thematic queen side expansion.
714,29,18,1Nxc6,b'r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1Nppn2/1p4B1/4P3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq -',He exchanges

717,29,21,1h6,b'r2qkb1r/5pp1/p1bppn1p/1p4B1/4P3/P1N4P/1PPQ1PP1/2KR1B1R w kq -',Now I needed to develop my Bf8. If I had moved it to e7 black has Bxf6 and if I reply Bxf6 he has Qxd6 and if I retake with the pawn he has Qh6 and my pawns are weakened and 0-0 is ruled out. So I decided to hit his bishop on g5. He is more or less forced to exchange it otherwise his pawn on e4 drops.
718,29,22,Qxf6,b'r3kb1r/5pp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1N4P/1PPQ1PP1/2KR1B1R w kq -',So I take with the queen

720,29,24,1Be7,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1N2P1P/1PPQ2P1/2KR1B1R w kq -',So now I can develop my bishop
721,29,25,1Kb1,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1N2P1P/1PPQ2P1/1K1R1B1R b kq -',It is not clear that his king is much safer here!
722,29,26,1O-O,b'r4rk1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1N2P1P/1PPQ2P1/1K1R1B1R w - -',I finally castle

724,29,28,1Rfb8,b'rr4k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1NB1P1P/1PPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - -',so I start to move my rooks over for attack
725,29,29,1Rdf1,b'rr4k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/1p6/4P3/P1NB1P1P/1PPQ2P1/1K3R1R b - -',Not quite sure what he is doing here. He needs to throw forward his king side pawns as soon as possible to try and open lines against my king before I do the same to his king on the queenside.
726,29,30,1b4,b'rr4k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/8/1p2P3/P1NB1P1P/1PPQ2P1/1K3R1R w - -',So this is the logical follow up

729,29,33,1g3,b'r5k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/8/1r2P3/2NB1PPP/1PPQ4/1K3R1R b - -',He wastes another move
730,29,34,1Rab8,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/8/1r2P3/2NB1PPP/1PPQ4/1K3R1R w - -',so I bring in more re-enforcements.
731,29,35,1b3,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bppq1p/8/1r2P3/1PNB1PPP/2PQ4/1K3R1R b - -',He prevents Rxb2 but maybe Nd1 was better rather than causing another pawn weakness
732,29,36,1Qd4,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/1r1qP3/1PNB1PPP/2PQ4/1K3R1R w - -',I planned to follow up with Bf6 and if Kb2 pawn a6-a5-a4 is very strong.
733,29,37,2Ne2,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/1r1qP3/1P1B1PPP/2PQN3/1K3R1R b - -',so he tries to push my queen back.
734,29,38,2Rb4xb3+,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/3qP3/1r1B1PPP/2PQN3/1K3R1R w - -',but I come up with this sacrifice.
735,29,39,2cxb3,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/3qP3/1P1B1PPP/3QN3/1K3R1R b - -',He takes
736,29,40,2Rxb3+,b'6k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/3qP3/1r1B1PPP/3QN3/1K3R1R w - -',I take back. This is the critical position. Now Ka2 leads to Qa4 mate. The question is what to do if he plays the best defence Kc2? At the time I thought I had to play Rb2+. Now if Kd1 I can take his queen with check and then move my queen to safety. So he has to play Kc1. Play could continue RxQd2 NxQd4 R(d2)xBd3 N(d4)xBc6 R(d3)-c3+ followed by taking his knight on c6 and we have the level endgame I mentioned earlier where I have bishop and 2 pawns for a rook. I was interested to see later that after Kc2 black does have an improvement on that line I can play Qa4! with many horrible threats!
737,29,41,2Kc1,b'6k1/4bpp1/p1bpp2p/8/3qP3/1r1B1PPP/3QN3/2K2R1R b - -',"But he didn't! it is now mate in 4 but I mated in 5 I took time-out to take his queen. Please see http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=41840

************************************************************** 
Generally the knights belong on c3 c6 f3 and f6 on their 1st developing move. The primary reason for this is each knight controls 2 of the 4 central squares: d4 d5 e4 and e5. I will speak more on controlling these crucial squares on White's move 7.
**************************************************************** 
The 2nd reason knights should be placed on these squares is that you don't know yet where they will be needed. Let's say later in the game you need your king's knight to help defend your queen side. The knight would get there faster from f6 than he would if you had played him to h6. If you wanted that knight to assist in an attack on my king he would be on the job faster from f6 than from e7. The same principle applies to all 4 of those knight locations.
**************************************************************** 
The third reason is a knight on f3 controls e1 d2 d4 e5 g5 g1 and h4; six squares. You usually want to place your pieces where they control as many squares as possible. A knight on e2 also controls 6 squares c1 c3 d5 f5 g3 and g1. A knight on h3 controls g5 f4 f2 and g1; only 4 squares thus an edge of the board knight is usually weaker than a knight in the center. A knight on f3 and e2 both control 6 squares but the one on f3 is usually stronger due to the 1st two reasons above. 
*************************************************************** 
There are exceptions to every rule though. The squares c3 c6 f3 & f6 are the ultimate starting locations for knights but depending on the position d2 e2 d7 & e7 can be best and on rare occasions a3 a6 h3 & h6 are the best places to put a knight. When the latter is the case it is usually just to relocate it to another place.
**************************************************************** 
Key Principle: Develop towards the center! Develop knights primarily to c3 c6 f3 & f6."
818,32,3,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',"So here we transpose into a QG (Queens Gambit) whether declined or accepted depends on you. In the QG White offers Black a ""free"" pawn in an attempt to draw Black's d pawn away from controlling the center. If Black accepts White has many resources to use to get the pawn back one of which is the simple Qa4+ followed by Qxc4. Black cannot hold the pawn.
****************************************************************** 
It is generally accepted that it is safe to take the pawn as long as you don't try to hold on to it. On the other hand I personally don't accept the QG pawn when I play Black. To take would mean moving my pawn away from the center to take a pawn that I cannot hold. Better to keep developing and supporting the center as you did with 3. ...c6 or with various other means.
****************************************************************** 
That is only a personal opinion though since many masters accept the pawn. If you choose to accept the pawn that's fine. Then you need to learn the various lines of play where black accepts the pawn.
****************************************************************** 
Key Principle: When and if you accept a pawn gambit be careful about trying to hold the pawn. I'm not saying never try to hold a gambit pawn. Sometimes depending on the position you  should keep the pawn. I am only saying be careful.

I still was not concerned as Black gives up the center control and I still have other resources to harass his queenside pawns and potentially gain the pawn back such as e3 followed by a4. If bxa4 then his pawn structure is terrible. I would then have no trouble winning the 2 pawns back!

****************************************************************** 
So we both are doing a good job of controlling the center. In the opening it is crucial to occupy and / or control the primary center squares d4 e4 d5 and e5. Secondarily it is also important to do the same to the 12 squares surrounding those 4 being c3 c4 c5 c6 d3 d6 e3 e6 f3 f4 f5 and f6. Lastly it is good to control any squares on the board you deem important based on the position.
****************************************************************** 
You have a pawn occupying d5 the c pawn controlling d5 a knight controlling d5 & e4 a bishop controlling e4 and the queen bearing down on d5. I have a pawn occupying d4 the c pawn controlling d5 the knights controlling the 4 primary squares and a queen honing in on d4.
****************************************************************** 

So thus far we both have a lot of control of the center but I have a little more than you do since you have no occupation or control of d4 or e5. My extra control is not a major thing as of yet but it is something you should be looking to work on. For example you may want to consider Nb8d7 and Qc7 both to control e5.

Be careful when bringing your queen out early as she can be subject to attack causing you to lose development. I will speak more on this on move 7 for black and white. I chose to bring my queen out early here because she can't be attacked easily on this square (exception being 6. ...dxc4 7.Qxc4 or 6.Qb6 as you  played no problem).

Isolated doubled pawns are worse because they are also harder to work with to promote them but more than that they can`t defend each other. Therefore they are easier for your opponent to attack and take them. 
*************************************************************** 
Rooks need open files to reach their full potential. Most frequently files are opened in the middle (among other reasons because the central pawns on the c d e & f files are the most frequently traded) and the rooks move there to gain their mobility. Yet an open a-file would be ideal as the queen rook automatically is on an open file.

Mohsen let me make up an imaginary scene then relate it to chess. Imagine twins Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack set aside $10000 in the year 2010 and invested it at a certain interest rate say for example 9%. In the year 2050 his total interest earned would be $304094.20. Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040 and sets aside $10000 and invests it at the same interest rate 9%. In the year 2050 his total interest earned would be only $13673.60.
****************************************************************** 
What is interesting about this scenario is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack! You may ask ""Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!""
****************************************************************** 
One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square to a more active location) as quickly as possible. If you don't you may find yourself behind in development. It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative similar to Jake in the illustration you're far less likely to be able to catch up! One way to get a lead in development is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop your queen then I develop my bishop to attack her forcing you to move her a 2nd time I gain a ""tempo"" and you lose a tempo. One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely play QNd7 right now for example. You'd lose your Queen!
****************************************************************** 
Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move he hinders you from doing what you may have planned (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan).

You have a knight bishop 2 pawns and your queen developed. The only material you have intentionally placed are the knight bishop and pawns. Your queen was intentionally placed on b6 then she moved back to c7 and c8 where I chased her. It is good to force your opponents hand! As I said if I force you to make a move you did not want to make it can put you in a position you don't want to be in!

I on the other hand have a bishop 2 knights 2 pawns and my queen not only developed but sitting where I intended them to be.

Furthermore I have 7 development moves you only have 5! White goes first so if all things remain equal white makes 1 development move then black makes 1 development move white makes a 2nd development move then black makes a 2nd development move and so on. Therefore black is always 1/2 development move behind. The battle in the opening is to tilt the scales in your favor (whether black or white). You want to force your opponent to lose development or tempo by attacking more valuable pieces with less valuable material.
****************************************************************** 
A 2nd way to force initiative in development is to develop a piece with check. The king moves (for example to d1 or d2 on the open d file) so you queen side castle putting the king in check again. You have developed your bishop your king to safety and brought your rook to an open file. All your opponent has done is move his king around. Good for you!

This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped closed positions while bishops are stronger in open positions. So you have to consider each game individually but generally as pieces get traded off closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up the bishops become stronger and stronger. So although both pieces are technically the same value the bishops are my piece of choice. That may be just a personal thing though because while most strong chess players agree with me I've met some who disagree. So here I attack your bishop and trade. Then I will have 2 bishops against a knight in the endgame.
****************************************************************** 
Also the trade gives you doubled pawns which can be compensated for by the fact that you also will have an opened file. Earlier in the game I stated that the opened file was more of an issue than the doubled pawns. In this case I feel the opposite because while you have an opened h file to attack my king the DSB (Dark Square Bishop) would help cover h2. 
****************************************************************** 
In addition if you castle on the king side your rook goes to f8 off of the open file. If you choose queen side castling you have a good deal of maneuvering required seeing how I attack your b pawn with my queen and my DSB is on the h2-b8 diagonal. To queen side castle you need to move your queen off the back rank. Her only square to go to is d7 which should be reserved for the queen side knight. "

****************************************************************** 
In this example though you may have done it with an intention to trade off my bishop but I not wanting to trade had an escape square. The knight has no attack or threat and there are no active squares he can move to (with exception of f6 where the knight just came from. That wastes time and hurts your development). To make things worse you helped me to shut your knight in further by trading on the e5 square (15... e5). This trading left me with a pawn on e5 cutting off your knights only escape route (f6).

I knew the knight would never get back into the game since you can't move your pawn on g7 as it is blocked by the pawn on g6. You can't move the pawn on g6 (to make space to move the pawn on g7) because I would play BxN. So the only way to make space for the knight would be to win the pawn on e5 before I play g4 but I have a enough to defend the pawn. You don't have enough fire power to win it.

1. He was trying to launch an attack on my king.
2. He had enough support with his next move Rf3. This would have brought his Rook as well as Bishop at c1 into the attack.
3. I was not very well in a situation to defend my king if he would have done that as my Rook at b6 and Bishop at c4 were not in a position to defend my king.
4. In a way my Rook at e8 way pinned to rank-8 (base rank) because if i moved it from rank-8 i was to be checkmated at Qc8#"

See what i move next. This was his first and last attack on me because after this he didn't get an opportunity to defend himself.

Now this move protects my f7 pawn and on the other hand forces his queen to move back to g4 as moving his queen to f4 will restrict his bishop"

Another good opening point is that you should not move the same pice twice during the opening (unless someone force you to).
