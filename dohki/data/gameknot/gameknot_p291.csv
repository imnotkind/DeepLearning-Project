8,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"The following is an interesting encounter in the Queen's Indian. White abandons his natural central play (e3-e4) to contest Black along the a1-h8 diagonal. This is a clear instance of White becoming too ""caught up"" with one-move attacks and countering Black's plans while losing sight of his own ideas."
9,1,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',From this basic position Black has many popular options. 3...b6 enters the Queen's Indian Defense 3...d5 is the Queen's Gambit 3...Bb4  is the Bogo-Indian and the text move 3...c5 allows White to enter the Modern Benoni with 4.d5.
10,1,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White signals his intention to continue quietly strengthening his central control (and not grabbing space with the more popular 4.d5). This allows Black a free hand to develop (again he has more space to maneuver his pieces).
11,1,3,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Queen's Indian formation. Black restrains White's central expansion along the h1-a8 light-square diagonal with ..b6 and ..Bb7.
12,1,4,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2PP4/4PNP1/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -','?' - Now White's passivity is becoming an issue. His bishop would have been well-positioned on d3 (the best move) where it immediately eyes e4 and gives White attacking possibilities. The decision to fianchetto contests Black along the long diagonal but it creates massive light-square weaknesses around his kingside. If White loses his light-square bishop this formation will be especially weak. This plan is also slow.
13,1,5,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/2pp4/2PP4/4PNP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',Attacking White's center. Castling first is also OK but in this position it doesn't much matter.
14,1,6,1Nb5,b'rn3rk1/pbq1bppp/1p2pn2/1NppN3/2PP4/4P1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -','?!' - White harasses the Black queen. His knights give an imposing impression but are they really that dangerous? If the knights don't accomplish anything concrete or establish more permanent outposts (specifically the b5 knight) they will lose a tempo in retreat which may allow Black to improve his position with tempo. Also shouldn't White be worrying about his c1 bishop which is blockaded by pawns? It seems White has abandoned the natural freeing plan of e3-e4 (supported by pieces) in favor of this (dubious) knight-harassment scheme. A better plan is cxd4 followed by Re1 aiming at e3-e4.
15,1,7,1Qc8,b'rnq2rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1NppN3/2PP4/4P1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black saves d8 for a rook.
16,1,8,1b3,b'rnq2rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1NppN3/2PP4/1P2P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -','?' - Better is 11.Qc2 which supports the e3-e4 advance White desperately needs.  This move bluntly plans Bb2 and dxc4 but in the process White loses control of the center.
17,1,9,Bxd5,b'rnqr2k1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/1NpbN3/3P4/1P2P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -','!?' - Avoiding an isolated queen's pawn position (not necessarily bad!) after ..exd5 and exchanging bishops. Black reasons that White's kingside light squares are weaker than his queenside ones and in any event the trading of pieces favors his cramped position.
18,1,10,Nc6,b'r1qr2k1/p3bppp/1pn1pn2/1Np1N3/3P4/1P2P1P1/PB3PKP/R2Q1R2 w - -',Also strong is ..Qb7  taking control of the long diagonal. White ought to contest this via Qf3! exchanging into a drawish endgame. The text presses for an advantage allowing White the sequence 15.Qf3 Nxe5 16.dxe5 when White's light-square control faces off against Black's queenside majority and obvious target on the doubled e5 pawn. Highly imbalanced.
19,1,11,1Qe2,b'r1qr2k1/p3bppp/1pn1pn2/1Np1N3/3P4/1P2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 b - -','?' - As above 12.Qf3! is strongest. Now Black is better.
20,1,12,1Na3,b'r1qr2k1/4bppp/ppn1pn2/2p1N3/3P4/NP2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 b - -','?' - This move is something of a blunder. White overlooked a forcing sequence for Black that wins material.
21,1,13,1cxd4,b'r1qr2k1/4bppp/ppn1pn2/4N3/3p4/NP2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 w - -',The e5 knight has no defense now but after exd4 Black wins the d-pawn. White must complicate the situation immediately via Rac1 pinning the knight to the queen.
22,1,14,b5,b'r1qr2k1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/1p2N3/2Np4/1P2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 w - -','?' - Much stronger is ..Nxe5! when Black simply wins a pawn for nothing. Black's idea is to trap one of the White knights but he loses sight of the significance along the light squares. Now White is back in the game (if he finds the right moves!)
23,1,15,Qb7,b'r2r2k1/1q2bppp/pNn1pn2/1p2N3/3p4/1P2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 w - -',A further mistake related to Black's last move; positionally Black's idea is sound - he seizes the light squares and attacks the b6 knight. He doesn't mind allowing Nxa8 as he will pick up 2 knights for the rook with a winning position. Indeed he believes the knight is trapped. But tactically he overlooks 19.Qf3! when White pins the c6 knight and actually seizes the advantage (the fight for light-square control is the most important struggle in this position.)
24,1,16,1Nxa8,b'N2r2k1/1q2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p2N3/3p4/1P2P1P1/PB2QPKP/R4R2 b - -','??' - Terrible. Even 19.Nxf7 grabbing one more pawn for the 2 knights' loss is better than the text. Obviously 19.Qf3 keeps White in the game.
25,1,17,d3,b'N2r2k1/1q2bppp/p3pn2/1p2n3/8/1P1pPPP1/PB2Q1KP/R4R2 w - -','!' - With the a8 knight trapped Black can rescue the d4 pawn via ..d3! or ..dxe3! since Bxe5? is impossible in both cases (after ..dxe3 Black threatens ...Rd2 pinning the queen). Black decides to make a passer.
26,1,18,b4,b'q2r2k1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/8/1p6/PP1pPPP1/1B1Q2KP/2R2R2 w - -',"'!' - Black hits upon the best plan. The old adage: ""knights need advanced outposts"" certainly applies here so Black rushes to create strong positions for his knights. One-move ""tricks"" like ..Nd5? (""centralizing"" the knight and scheming 24.Qxd3?? Nf4 ) are clearly worse: from d5 Black's knight simply obstructs the d8 rook and can easily be chased away via e4 when he has nowhere to go but backwards."
27,1,19,2Bxf6,b'q2r2k1/4bppp/p1n1pB2/8/1p6/PP1pPPP1/3Q2KP/2R2R2 b - -',Now the maneuver ..Nd5-c3 is a very real threat so White squashes it and doubles Black's kingside pawns. A fair trade? Not exactly but there is little else. More tenacious was axb4 retaining the bishop but White is hopeless either way.
28,1,20,Na5,b'q2r2k1/4bp1p/p3pp2/n7/Pp6/1P1pPPP1/3Q2KP/2R2R2 w - -',Very strong (and made possible by the immobilizing 23..b4!). White has severe problems defending both the b3 weakness and the d3-d2 advance. So reasonably White chooses to lash out in attack. Unfortunately for him Black doesn't budge: White's position is hopeless. The rest is simple technique.

101,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Shirov has punched with both hands: 1.d4 and 1.e4.  Whichever one he chooses Shirov always finds a way to create exciting attacks.
102,3,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',And white's intentions are shown immediately King's Gambit hasn't been popular for a long time but it always manages to create attacking chances for white whether it works out or not.
103,3,2,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black accepts.  There is a common theme of black accepting material in this game and his position becoming more and more difficult to play.
104,3,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A less common alternative in 3.Bc4 immediately targeting f7.  However that move allows 3... Qh4 which 3.Nf3 avoids.
105,3,4,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq g6',Black defends his vulnerable pawn on f4.
106,3,5,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White aims his guns at f7.  f7 is black's most vulnerable square in the opening because the king is the ONLY defender of that square.
107,3,6,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Once again white ignores the material he finishes his development instead.
108,3,7,Qxf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',White lines up on the f file.
109,3,8,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',Black discourages regaining the pawn on f4.  White can't retake because if queens are traded white's attack will dissipate.
110,3,9,e5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/4P3/2B2p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',7.e5!  White plays to open up files and he sacrifices pawns with gain of tempo for the sake of opening up the e file against black's king.
111,3,10,Qxe5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4q3/2B2p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',Once again black accepts the material once again this is a perfectly reasonable response and once again black's position becomes more and more difficult to play.  The only piece that's black has developed is his queen.  On the other hand white has three pieces in the game and some open files to work with.  All he needs to do now is turn black's king into an even bigger bullseye and bring his remaing pieces out.
112,3,11,Bxf7+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1B1p/8/4q3/5p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',First white draws out black's king.
113,3,12,Kxf7,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/4q3/5p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',White is left with a challenging question how do you bring the undeveloped pieces into the attack?  It's hard to do he needs to develop while not giving black a chance to recuperate from the tactical blows white keeps on throwing out.  Take a second to look for a way to develop it's a clever solution.
114,3,13,d4,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/4q3/3P1p2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - d3',Then he opens up the game with gain of time.
115,3,14,Qxd4+,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/8/3q1p2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',And black (as always) accepts.  According to theory I've seen 9... Qf5! slowing white's opening up of the game is stronger.
116,3,15,1Be3,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/8/3q1p2/4BQ2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - -', A stunner!  White develops with tempo and the bishop cannot be taken.  If 10... Qxe3 11.Qxe3 and the pawn is pinned to the king.
117,3,16,1Qf6,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/5q2/8/5p2/4BQ2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',For the first time black doesn't grab.  If 10... Qxb2 11.Qxf4  leads to a decisive attack for white.
118,3,17,1Bxf4,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/5q2/8/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - -',White's bishop is attacked so he takes back the pawn and now the f file is free of pawns...
119,3,18,1Ke8,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp3p/5q2/8/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',So black flees the file white has a great rook on the f file but he's now needs to bring his other one to the e file.
120,3,19,1Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp3p/5q2/8/5B2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',White develops the rooks are now connected and the second one will soon come to the e file.
121,3,20,1Nd5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp3p/2n2q2/3N4/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',But before playing Rae1  he gives the queen a tickle while pressuring c7 and e7.
122,3,21,1Rae1+,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp3p/2n3q1/3N4/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',And somehow all of white pieces are in the attack and black has only developed one besides his queen.
123,3,22,1Bd6,b'r1b1k1nr/ppppb2p/2nB2q1/3N4/8/5Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',An incredible move!  The bishop cannot be taken because Qf8# is mate (the bishop's pinned to the king).
124,3,23,1Kd8,b'r1bk2nr/ppppb2p/2nB2q1/3N4/8/5Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',Black flees but this allows a spectacular conclusion.  See if you can find a nice mate... then look for a better one.
125,3,24,1Qf8+,b'r1bk1Qnr/ppppb2p/2nB2q1/3N4/8/8/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',And the obvious mate is 16... Bxf8 17.Rxf8  Qe8 18.Rexe8# or 18.Rfxe8#
126,3,25,1Bxc7#,b'r1bk1bnr/ppBp3p/2n3q1/3N4/8/8/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',A nice finish.  It's rare to see a game where white mates after 17 moves when he's only taken 4 pawns and is down -14 in material.  I hope you enjoyed this toss back to the old school style of attack from the super GM Shirov.  If you have any thoughts criticisms variations don't hesitate to PM me.  I'm thinking of doing a series of analyzed games on an opening if anyone has any exciting variations you'd like to see a pretty game in please PM me about it.
127,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This offhand game is one of the most instructive examples of how to develop rapidly and attack. It is what is called a 'consultation game' where one player( in this case Paul Morphy) plays against two opponents who were allowed to confer with each other to decide which move to make. Apparently the Duke was criticised in the newspaper of the time for playing a game of chess at the opera.

This move was recommended as a defense by the leading French chess player Andre Danican Philidor (1726-95). Holding the pawn this way is definately solid. but black renounces the chance to play ...d5 in one go however anchoring the e4 can't be wrong. Nimzowitch commented that ""In the open game 1.e4 e5 either d3 or d4 now or later is always a correct move."" This seems to be valid today.

131,4,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This is a good move - White prepares to develop the Queen's Bishop takes another square in the centre and puts Black's claim to the centre under pressure.
132,4,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! This is a weak move. However it does hold some logic. The white knight and pawn are attacking blacks pawn on e5.black's pawn is defended only by the d6 pawn.Instead of bringing another defender into play e.g 3...Nd7 or Nf6; which by the way is much better  black chooses to pin the knight. The drawback to this is that white has a good tactic at his disposal that forces black to trade the bishop for the knight.

134,4,7,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is the tactic. It stops 4. ... dxe5 5. Qxd8 Kxd8 6. Nxe5 winning a pawn and disrupting the safety of blacks king is now stuck in the middle of the board without castling rights.
135,4,8,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Material balance has now been restored however Morphy has one piece development:the queen and can now develop another. Morphy has a lead in development and the advantage of the two bishops.

137,4,10,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',The decisive mistake.  Better was 6...Qd7.  True Black had an unpleasant choice with 6...Qf6 7.Qb3 b6?! 8.Nc3 Ne7? 9.Nb5 Na6 10.Qa4 Nc5 11.Nd6 ! Kd8 12.Qe8 mate. Also it is clear in this position that white has a substantial lead in development.  White has two pieces developed and black has only one...and it is white's move!
138,4,11,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Usually it is not a good idea to move the same piece twice...but this is a fork...the pawn on f7 and the pawn on b7. All the small advice you hear control of the center don't move the same piece twice etc. goes out the window when you see an easy way to win material!
139,4,12,Qe7,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This move is positionaly weak because it blocks in the f8 Bishop and dooms the black king to staying in the center. It does prevent both pawns from being taken

157,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here is a really exciting game from the second round of the GameKnot #32 Advanced section. I have been playing in these site-wide tourneys for three years and always in the Intermediate section. After the first round was completed I was bumped up to the Advanced section because my rating had increased past the 1500 mark. I knew that I was going to be in a world of hurt and was just hoping not to get shut out. My dilemma was best characterized by a simple question - Play it safe? Or go for the gold? I opted to get aggressive and slug it out and was rewarded by a very satisfying attack early on. My opponent and new friend bly_garcia defended extremely well and was able to launch a deadly counter-attack that threatened mate in short order. The endgame was very exciting with some really cool tactical possibilities for both sides. Down in material my opponent proved why he is the stronger player and salvaged a very nice draw. I hope you enjoy the game! 
158,5,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',As white has opted for the most popular first move of 1. e4 I of course respond with my favorite - the Scandinavian. I know I know....I just can't get away from the Scandi - it's an addiction!
159,5,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"Advance variation where white declines the ""gambit"" pawn and plays to establish a big center."
160,5,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Claiming space on the queenside and clamping down on d4.
161,5,4,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',?! White announces his intentions of a kingside push very early. This is a risky endeavor if not played correctly as black's light squared bishop has now become more powerful and the real estate surrounding the white king has been weakened.
162,5,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',With the intentions keeping the light squared bishop outside of the pawn chain after black plays e6.
163,5,6,Qe2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! This move confused me a little. I was expecting 4. g4 with tempo as white has already signaled his intention of kingside play. This play does threaten the weak b5 square with check but it also restricts whites light squared bishop.
164,5,7,a6,b'rn1qkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Probably not worthy of an exclamation but very solid none the less. Black's lowly a pawn now successfully defends the b5 square against whites queen and bishop battery.
165,5,8,d3,b'rn1qkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',? I considered this move a mistake. While it does open up a line for whites dark squared bishop it further restricts the queen/bishop line that white just established. Perhaps Nf3 or Nc3 was better.
166,5,9,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',As planned. Black can now develop the dark squared bishop while reinforcing the pawn chain on the white squares.
167,5,10,h4,b'rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P4/PPP1Q1P1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq h3',? White lashes out on the kingside but with the wrong pawn. Again 6. g4 with tempo was much stronger. It could then be followed by playing h4. White has now opened up some juicy lines of attack for black on the kingside. At this point the beginning of some attacking themes started crossing my mind. I felt that the white pawns on the kingside may be vulnerable to attack if I could only develop my pieces in that direction.
168,5,11,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/1p2bppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P4/PPP1Q1P1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',A developing move which hits the h pawn twice. Notice that from the h4 square black can deliver a check with either the dark squared bishop or the queen.
169,5,12,g3,b'rn1qk1nr/1p2bppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P2P1/PPP1Q3/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White simply defends his weak h pawn. I felt pretty good here as I had a lead in development and space was roughly equal. As white has opened up space around his king my plan was to exploit that fact quickly.
170,5,13,h5,b'rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppPb1p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPP1Q3/RNB1KBNR w KQkq h6',A counter thrust on the kingside which negates the pesky tempo gaining move white would have if allowed to play g4. This play will also support an attack on the enemy queen by putting the light squared bishop on g4.
171,5,14,Bd2,b'rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppPb1p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',White hurries to catch up in development. He probably sees the dangers of 0-0 and wants to play 0-0-0.
172,5,15,Bg4,b'rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',Posting the bishop nicely and attacking the queen. White must now move her and use time better spent developing.

174,5,17,Nh6,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPB1Q2/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',!? While developing to the edge is not always wise in this case black sees two potential posts for this knight on either f5 or g4.
175,5,18,1Be2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPBBQ2/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',White correctly assesses that his light squared bishop is weak and offers it up for exchange.
176,5,19,1Bxe2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPPBbQ2/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Black accepts the deal as space on g4 will be created for a righteous posting of the knight currently residing on h6.
177,5,20,1Qxe2,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',White re-takes with the queen as he wants to develop his Ng1 to the f3 square.
178,5,21,1Ng4,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppP2p/5PnP/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',"As planned - black claims the strong g4 post. It is worthy noting at this point that while black has the lead in development BOTH sides are unusually under-developed for a game 11 moves old. I don't see this kind of thing too often as was a little paranoid. The initial question of ""Play it safe? Or get aggressive?"" returned to my thoughts. As blacks position is currently stable I figured getting better developed was probably the smart play. I didn't realize at the time that a very nice attack was about to play out."
179,5,22,1Nf3,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppP2p/5PnP/3P1NP1/PPPBQ3/RN2K2R b KQkq -',As planned. White now has 0-0 available if needed and a strong piece comes to the defense of the weakened kingside. I'm sure my opponent was working out variations involving the g5 square as he is hitting it three times now to my two.
180,5,23,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/1p2bpp1/p1n1p3/2ppP2p/5PnP/3P1NP1/PPPBQ3/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Black simply develops and hopes that white does not force the issue on g5.
181,5,24,1c3,b'r2qk2r/1p2bpp1/p1n1p3/2ppP2p/5PnP/2PP1NP1/PP1BQ3/RN2K2R b KQkq -',?! This move tortured me. White obviously intends to reinforce his center but at the expense of a developing square for his Nb8 and some mobility of his Bd2. What's up his sleeve?
182,5,25,1b5,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5PnP/2PP1NP1/PP1BQ3/RN2K2R w KQkq b6',"This was actually a ""waiting"" move but it does claim some nice space on the queenside and supports the c4 square."

184,5,27,1Bxh4,b'r2qk2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pnb/2PP2P1/PP1BQ2N/RN2K2R w KQkq -',! If 15. NxN then 15...Bxg . If 15. gxB then 15...Qxh . Either way black can bring some pain to whites weakened position and still come out OK. One of the main reasons of making this play was to prevent white from being able to castle therefor keeping his king in the middle of the board. Black is hoping for the continuation of 15. gxB Qxh  16. Kf1 Qh3  17. Qg2 Qxd3  with the compensation of three pawns for a bishop and white not being able to castle.
185,5,28,1gxh4,b'r2qk2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5PnP/2PP4/PP1BQ2N/RN2K2R b KQkq -',It appears that white is going play along:)

187,5,30,1Kf1,b'r3k2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pnq/2PP4/PP1BQ2N/RN3K1R b kq -',Obviously 16. Kd1 fails to the strength of 16...Nf2 ! (a nasty fork that loses a rook for white).
188,5,31,1Qh3+,b'r3k2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2PP3q/PP1BQ2N/RN3K1R w kq -',Still part of the plan.
189,5,32,1Qg2,b'r3k2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2PP3q/PP1B2QN/RN3K1R b kq -',Here was the telling point of my plan. 17. Kg1 could be better defended but I was hoping white would opt to try to eliminate the dangerous threat of my queen roaming around with impugnity in his back yard. White offers up a queen exchange to extinguish the immediate threats.
190,5,33,1Qxd3+,b'r3k2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2Pq4/PP1B2QN/RN3K1R w kq -',Obviously declined to maintain material equality and the attack continues.
191,5,34,1Ke1,b'r3k2r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2Pq4/PP1B2QN/RN2K2R b kq -',I had incorrectly assumed that white would once again offer to exchange queens. He chooses however to evade the check and maintain his own threats on my Ng4. I failed to see how dangerous these threats are however and play.....

194,5,37,1Qxf3,b'2kr3r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2P2q2/PP1B3N/RN2K2R w - -',Black sees the opportunity white just missed and opts to end this particular skirmish satisfied with achieving the initial goal of preventing white from castling and keeping his king in the center of the board - hopefully vulnerable to a future attack.
195,5,38,2Nxf3,b'2kr3r/5pp1/p1n1p3/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2P2N2/PP1B4/RN2K2R b - -',Naturally.
196,5,39,2f6,b'2kr3r/6p1/p1n1pp2/1pppP2p/5Pn1/2P2N2/PP1B4/RN2K2R w - -',As the smoke clears from that last skirmish I opt to instigate another. Realizing that I have basically exchanged a bishop for three pawns I intend to use this pawn advantage to remove his e and f pawns which will clear files for my rooks to attack on.
197,5,40,2exf6,b'2kr3r/6p1/p1n1pP2/1ppp3p/5Pn1/2P2N2/PP1B4/RN2K2R b - -',As black is hitting e5 three times to whites two white must take to maintain material.
198,5,41,2gxf6,b'2kr3r/8/p1n1pp2/1ppp3p/5Pn1/2P2N2/PP1B4/RN2K2R w - -',Not 21...Nxf as the pressure on e5 must be maintained.
199,5,42,2b4,b'2kr3r/8/p1n1pp2/1ppp3p/1P3Pn1/2P2N2/P2B4/RN2K2R b - b3',White lashes out on the queenside hoping for 22...cxb 23. cxb which will open up c3 for his knight and also clear some room for his Bd2 to operate on as well as opening up a clear avenue on blacks exposed king.
200,5,43,2c4,b'2kr3r/8/p1n1pp2/1p1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/2P2N2/P2B4/RN2K2R w - -',Closing off the c3 square for white to develop on and creating a nice pawn wedge on the white squares.
201,5,44,2a4,b'2kr3r/8/p1n1pp2/1p1p3p/PPp2Pn1/2P2N2/3B4/RN2K2R b - a3',! Good move. white intends to bring his Ra1 into play down the a file. Black must shift his forces to the queenside to defend and white hopes to pick up the h pawn in the process.
202,5,45,2Kb7,b'3r3r/1k6/p1n1pp2/1p1p3p/PPp2Pn1/2P2N2/3B4/RN2K2R w - -',Clearing the 8th rank for rook mobility.
203,5,46,2axb5,b'3r3r/1k6/p1n1pp2/1P1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/2P2N2/3B4/RN2K2R b - -',! Another good move. White achieves his goal of owning the a file by forcing black to open it up for him by re-taking to maintain equality.
204,5,47,2axb5,b'3r3r/1k6/2n1pp2/1p1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/2P2N2/3B4/RN2K2R w - -',Practically forced. Black is still solid but now must contend with the new found mobility of whites Ra1.
205,5,48,2Na3,b'3r3r/1k6/2n1pp2/1p1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/N1P2N2/3B4/R3K2R b - -',! That's three strong moves in row for white - he is getting back into the game. White threatens to take out the black pawn on b5. If black protects it by 25...Kb6 then white can simply re-develop the knight to c2. If black chooses the more aggressive 25...Ra8 pinning the knight he still just re-develops to c2 to protect his Ra1.
206,5,49,2Kb6,b'3r3r/8/1kn1pp2/1p1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/N1P2N2/3B4/R3K2R w - -',I choose to simply protect the b pawn.
207,5,50,2Ke2,b'3r3r/8/1kn1pp2/1p1p3p/1Pp2Pn1/N1P2N2/3BK3/R6R b - -',! Interesting. White leaves his knight on the edge and opens up the 1st rank for his rooks to operate on. I was figuring on Nc2 at the time but failed to see how this was a much more passive move.
208,5,51,2e5,b'3r3r/8/1kn2p2/1p1pp2p/1Pp2Pn1/N1P2N2/3BK3/R6R w - -',As my opponent has made several strong moves in a row I opt to press the issue in the area that I feel I have the advantage which is with my pawn advantage. I'm hitting e5 three times to his two so I know he will have to re-take. I'm still planning to center my rooks for an attack down the middle now that the threat of action down the a file is at least temporarily stalled.
209,5,52,2fxe5,b'3r3r/8/1kn2p2/1p1pP2p/1Pp3n1/N1P2N2/3BK3/R6R b - -',Practically forced.
210,5,53,2fxe5,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p1pp2p/1Pp3n1/N1P2N2/3BK3/R6R w - -',Correct as I do not want to lose my nice post on g4. Attack on d4 is my next goal.
211,5,54,2Be3+,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p1pp2p/1Pp3n1/N1P1BN2/4K3/R6R b - -',! Nice move! White throws a mean check that also supports the d4 square. Black must eliminate this bishop and in the process lose the nice knight posting on g4. White has signalled his intention to eliminate pieces (as he has three to my two) and hopes to use whatever piece he has remaining to pick off my central pawns.
212,5,55,2Nxe3,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p1pp2p/1Pp5/N1P1nN2/4K3/R6R w - -',"I hate to keep saying ""Practically forced"" but I feel that this last move was. It does have the added benefit for black of being a knight-for-bishop exchange. This is going to a very exciting endgame!"
213,5,56,2Kxe3,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p1pp2p/1Pp5/N1P1KN2/8/R6R b - -',White naturally equalizes while bringing his king to the support of d4.
214,5,57,2d4+,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p2p2p/1Ppp4/N1P1KN2/8/R6R w - -',! Here black puts white to the test. Both sides are hitting d4 three times so white will come out even should exchanges occur. The problem with that is however that whites king will be left extremely vulnerable in the middle of the board as black will surely start attacking with his rooks.
215,5,58,3Kd2,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p2p2p/1Ppp4/N1P2N2/3K4/R6R b - -',White sees the dangers just mentioned and wisely retreats.
216,5,59,3dxc3+,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p2p2p/1Pp5/N1p2N2/3K4/R6R w - -',Black opens up the d file with a double check. Note that white cannot re-take. If he does the very nasty 31...Rd3  wins whites Nf3.
217,5,60,3Kc2,b'3r3r/8/1kn5/1p2p2p/1Pp5/N1p2N2/2K5/R6R b - -',Again white sees the obvious tactic and evades the check. I'm betting he hoped to exchange rooks via the d file and head into an endgame of my pawns vs. his pieces.
218,5,61,3Nxb4+,b'3r3r/8/1k6/1p2p2p/1np5/N1p2N2/2K5/R6R w - -',I really liked this move. Since I am a pawn up I offer to exchange a knight and a pawn for a knight - getting back to even material. I envision 32. Kxc Rd3  33. KxN RxN 34. Nxb c3! with hopes of making him defend against promotion.
219,5,62,3Kc1,b'3r3r/8/1k6/1p2p2p/1np5/N1p2N2/8/R1K4R b - -',Once again my friend bly_garcia sees this and sidesteps it nicely. He has however broken the connection between his two rooks. I'm wondering how to best take advantage of this fact.
220,5,63,3e4,b'3r3r/8/1k6/1p5p/1np1p3/N1p2N2/8/R1K4R w - -',As I feel that my  2 is only temporary I opt to start my isolated pawn down the lonely road towards promotion with a tempo move. I have no illusions of it actually promoting but its threat of doing so will keep my opponent on the defensive.
221,5,64,3Ne5,b'3r3r/8/1k6/1p2N2p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R b - -',! Nice. The threat of forking my two rooks must be dealt with immediately.
222,5,65,3Rde8,b'4r2r/8/1k6/1p2N2p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R w - -',What better way to defend than to attack. Any check the Ne5 throws my way can simply be evaded and this rook move to e8 supports the isolani.
223,5,66,3Nd7+,b'4r2r/3N4/1k6/1p5p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R b - -',Of course I saw this coming.
224,5,67,3Kc7,b'4r2r/2kN4/8/1p5p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R w - -',Threatening the attacker but leaving the b pawn vulnerable.
225,5,68,3Nf6,b'4r2r/2k5/5N2/1p5p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R b - -',This lone wolf knight is causing all kinds of problems. The pawn on e4 must still be protected so....
226,5,69,3Re5,b'7r/2k5/5N2/1p2r2p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/R1K4R w - -',! Evading the threat on the rook and reinforcing the weak b and h pawns.
227,5,70,3Rb1,b'7r/2k5/5N2/1p2r2p/1np1p3/N1p5/8/1RK4R b - -',Threatening the Nb4 and putting a wicked X ray on the weak b pawn.
228,5,71,3Nd3+,b'7r/2k5/5N2/1p2r2p/2p1p3/N1pn4/8/1RK4R w - -',A time gaining check that will allow the black king the chance to get back to the defense of the b pawn.
229,5,72,3Kc2,b'7r/2k5/5N2/1p2r2p/2p1p3/N1pn4/2K5/1R5R b - -',White evades the check and threatens to gobble up the c pawn.
230,5,73,3Kc6,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p1p3/N1pn4/2K5/1R5R w - -',The black king now assumes his role of protector from a square that cannot be checked. Once again it is decision time for white.......
231,5,74,3Rbg1,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p1p3/N1pn4/2K5/6RR b - -',"! White chooses correctly and does not take the ""free"" pawn on c3 as it does not threaten anything and is going nowhere. White intends to wreak havoc on the extremely weak 6th and 7th ranks."
232,5,75,3e3,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p5/N1pnp3/2K5/6RR w - -',As protecting the weak 6th and 7th ranks will simply take too much time I opt to press the one big advantage that I have which is the supported passed pawn.
233,5,76,3Kxc3,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p5/N1Knp3/8/6RR b - -',White goes ahead and takes the freebie and I got a little confused. Was he intending to sac his weak Na3 for my b and c pawns? Or perhaps slide his king to d4 and threaten my Re5? I wasn't going to give him time to decide so I kept pushing for a new queen.
234,5,77,3e2,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p5/N1Kn4/4p3/6RR w - -',White MUST play correctly and prevent my promotion - not only will the scales of material be tipped my way but also because a new queen will created with a check as well.
235,5,78,4Nc2,b'7r/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/6RR b - -',White over-protects the queening square while getting this knight back into the fray.
236,5,79,4Rf8,b'5r2/8/2k2N2/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/6RR w - -',! Giving up hope of the h pawn ever meaning anything and attacking the knight that is camped out in my back yard. The real strength of this move however is that it targets f1 where a favorable exchange may be possible.
237,5,80,4Rg6,b'5r2/8/2k2NR1/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/7R b - -',!! Excellent move! White protects the vulnerable Nf6 while threatening a brutal discovered check. (Note that 41. Nd4  would have been a waste of time as black could simply evade while maintaing all current threats and the Nc2 is needed to cover e1).
238,5,81,4Kc7,b'5r2/2k5/5NR1/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/7R w - -',The only move. White is threatening checks and forks aplenty. I must now find a square for my king that will be safe from any check if I am to have any chance of initiating any offense of my own.
239,5,82,4Rg7+,b'5r2/2k3R1/5N2/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/7R b - -',White keeps up the pressure and slowly starts cutting off life saving defensive resources for the black king.
240,5,83,4Kc8,b'2k2r2/6R1/5N2/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/7R w - -',Whew....safe for the moment at least. White cannot safely check with his next move.
241,5,84,4Nd7,b'2k2r2/3N2R1/8/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/7R b - -',! But he can fork my rooks! Strong move!
242,5,85,4Rf1,b'2k5/3N2R1/8/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p3/5r1R w - -',! So I respond with a strong move of my own! Whites Rh1 is now attacked but more importantly the e1 square is now being hit by black three times to whites two. 44. RxR is awful as black will simply queen on f1 instead. White must protect his Rh1 and come out of any e1 queening scenario with the raw end of the deal.
243,5,86,4Rh2,b'2k5/3N2R1/8/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N1p2R/5r2 b - -',White wisely gets out of the way and I'm sure he hopes to double his rooks on the g file if he can.
244,5,87,4e1=Q+,b'2k5/3N2R1/8/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/2N4R/4qr2 w - -',Game on! Black now wins material but still has big defensive problems.
245,5,88,4Nxe1,b'2k5/3N2R1/8/1p2r2p/2p5/2Kn4/7R/4Nr2 b - -',Practically forced.
246,5,89,4Rexe1,b'2k5/3N2R1/8/1p5p/2p5/2Kn4/7R/4rr2 w - -',Forced on my part to preserve that rook from the threat is was receiving on e5.
247,5,90,4Nb6+,b'2k5/6R1/1N6/1p5p/2p5/2Kn4/7R/4rr2 b - -',White frees up his attacking position with a tempo check.
248,5,91,4Kd8,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p5p/2p5/2Kn4/7R/4rr2 w - -',Once again the black king is alone and under fire. I attempt to get him over to the e file where he will have some cover from the Re1.
249,5,92,4Rxh5,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p5R/2p5/2Kn4/8/4rr2 b - -',! And white threatens mate in 1.
250,5,93,4Rec1+,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p5R/2p5/2Kn4/8/2r2r2 w - -',The question here was whether to play 47...Rf8 to prevent the mate or to try to find some mating nets of my own. Since I could play Rf8 anyway if my attacking ideas failed I opted to go on a little king hunt of my own.
251,5,94,4Kd4,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p5R/2pK4/3n4/8/2r2r2 b - -',White runs for the cover of his pieces.
252,5,95,4Rf4+,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p5R/2pK1r2/3n4/8/2r5 w - -',It was at this point that I thought a draw my three-fold repetition was possible. I analyzed lines involving the white king making circles around my Nd3. I wasn't sure if I could defend well enough after I played Rf8 and my opponent followed with R5h7 so I kept on checking - hoping that my material advantage would come into play.
253,5,96,4Kd5,b'3k4/6R1/1N6/1p1K3R/2p2r2/3n4/8/2r5 b - -',Finding a temporarily safe home for his king. 49...Nb4  loses as his mate in 1 threat is just too great.
254,5,97,4Rf8,b'3k1r2/6R1/1N6/1p1K3R/2p5/3n4/8/2r5 w - -',Alleviating the immediate mate in 1 threat. White now has time to make the move that I feared most.
255,5,98,5Rhh7,b'3k1r2/6RR/1N6/1p1K4/2p5/3n4/8/2r5 b - -',!! White delivers a massive blow! Coupled with the assistance of his Nb6 and his king white threatens a brutal mate on the 8th rank.
256,5,99,5Nf4+,b'3k1r2/6RR/1N6/1p1K4/2p2n2/8/8/2r5 w - -',!! Very strong move for a couple of reasons - It obviously delivers a life saving check that white must address but much importantly it will clear the d file for blacks Rc1 to assist in the defense of his monarch.
257,5,100,5Kc6,b'3k1r2/6RR/1NK5/1p6/2p2n2/8/8/2r5 b - -',White evades and puts more heat on d7.
258,5,101,5Rd1,b'3k1r2/6RR/1NK5/1p6/2p2n2/8/8/3r4 w - -',! Black now has a defensive resource. If rooks are exchanged the black king will have a little breathing room along the 8th rank.
259,5,102,5Rgc7,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1NK5/1p6/2p2n2/8/8/3r4 b - -',! My friend bly_garcia sees this and creates another mate in 1 threat on c8!
260,5,103,5Rd6+,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1NKr4/1p6/2p2n2/8/8/8 w - -',!! If 53. KxR then 53...Rf6  loses the white knight AND draws the king away from his protection of the Rc7.
261,5,104,5Kxb5,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1N1r4/1K6/2p2n2/8/8/8 b - -',White regains some material while maintaing all threats.
262,5,105,5Rxb6+,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1r6/1K6/2p2n2/8/8/8 w - -',! Another strong move. If 54. KxR then 54...Nd5  forking the king and the Rc7
263,5,106,5Kxb6,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1K6/8/2p2n2/8/8/8 b - -',Black eliminates the kamakazi rook and is rewarded by......
264,5,107,5Nd5+,b'3k1r2/2R4R/1K6/3n4/2p5/8/8/8 w - -',Per the plan. Black now threatens to exchange his knight for the Rc7 and head into the final stages of the game up a full pawn.
265,5,108,5Kb7,b'3k1r2/1KR4R/8/3n4/2p5/8/8/8 b - -',White stubbornly hangs on to his mate threat on c8.
266,5,109,5Nxc7,b'3k1r2/1Kn4R/8/8/2p5/8/8/8 w - -',Of course.
267,5,110,5Rxc7,b'3k1r2/1KR5/8/8/2p5/8/8/8 b - -',Of course. At this point white probably realizes that his attack has failed but a draw is well in hand.
268,5,111,5Rf4,b'3k4/1KR5/8/8/2p2r2/8/8/8 w - -',Being the much weaker player I don't realize the draw quite yet and cling to the hopes of my pawn advantage being enough to win.
269,5,112,5Rc5,b'3k4/1K6/8/2R5/2p2r2/8/8/8 b - -',Getting off of the c7 square which must be protected by king white effectively cuts off all access to the pawn by the black king. He has two moves to get to b5 and force its demise and I just can't get to the pawn at all.
270,5,113,5Kd7,b'8/1K1k4/8/2R5/2p2r2/8/8/8 w - -',Praying for a miracle:)

274,5,117,5Rd4,b'8/8/3k4/1KR5/2pr4/8/8/8 w - -',And my draw offer was accepted. In my three years and 1000's of games played here on GameKnot I put this one in my Top 3 of all time. I'm not sure that I have played a more exciting game on this site. Many thanks to my new friend bly_garcia for giving me such a great battle! I can't say that I will voluntarily move up to the Advanced Section of these GameKnot tournaments as my nerves will not allow it but I sure do appreciate the beauty of this jewel and will remember it for a long long time! Cheers - Thomas
275,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This was my opening game in a minitournament consisting of teammates from Waskally Wabbits and Morose Mooses. I decided to annotate all my games from the competition as this would also help me to focus more on my games and hopefully cut out most blunders. I can't promise scintillating play as I'm not that kind of a player. :) 

My opponent Blackbaron is my most frequent opponent on Gameknot and I played against him in my very first minitournament in this site. We usually have very exciting games with a lot of exchanges early on so let's see how this one goes. 

He starts with 1.e4. My personal favourite pawn moves to the centre and frees two pieces the light squared bishop and the queen. My usual defence against 1.e4 is the French Defence."
276,6,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',1.... c5. The Sicilian my current preferred opening against 1. e4. I had a pretty good run with the French and will return to it soon. Tried the Pirc for a while with horrible results. Record with the French : 50% Record with the Pirc : 35%.  Have recently ordered the book Play the French by John Watson (just arrived today in fact. Takes 12 days for Amazon.com to deliver to Bangladesh for anyone who might be interested) :) . Will switch back to the French after I study the book for a while.
277,6,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Normal development moves the Knight to its best square and follows the rule : Knights before Bishops as we know what the best squares are for the knights whereas it is better to wait a bit before developing the bishop.
278,6,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move frees my light squared bishop. I plan to play the Sicilian Dragon so while my king side bishop looks horribly locked in I 'm not too worried.  I plan to fianchetto the bishop. The fianchettoed bishop failed miserably for me in the Pirc Defence let's see how the Dragon suits my style.
279,6,4,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Unorthodox move no idea if this move is in the book will have to check later after the game what the best response is. For now will have to follow my instincts. Perhaps he is planning to fianchetto his own bishop to prevent me from playing g6 for the Dragon formation.
280,6,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Normal development Knight to its best square. If he fianchettoes his bishop to counter my Dragon I'll still continue with my plan I fancy the early exchange which wins his bishop for my knight.
281,6,6,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. e5. Typically aggressive play by the Baron but has he overlooked something? I can play 4.... dxe5 which wins a pawn because if 5. Nxe5? I can play 5..... Qd4! which forks the knight and rook. Let's wait and see though.
282,6,7,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1p3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Awaiting his response...
283,6,8,Nxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He has overlooked it!
284,6,9,Qd4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',How will he defend this? Give away the rook as a sort of poisoned rook if there is such a thing and attempt to trap my queen? For example 6. Nc4  Qxa1 7. Bb2  Qxa2 8. Nc3 Qa6 and so on. Or even 7. Nc3 which looks better. Let's wait and see. Of course trapping my queen is one thing capturing it with no further loss of material is something else entirely :)
285,6,10,Nxf7,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pNpp/5n2/2p5/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Actually I was expecting this Kxf7 looks safe and worth the extra piece.
286,6,11,Kxf7,b'rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/5n2/2p5/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',Possible responses from the Baron? Bc4 looks plausible. Note the placement of my knight by choosing to develop it early to it's best square it prevents my opponent's queen from playing threatening queen moves such as Qa5 or Qg4. The Knight defends beautifully from there.
287,6,12,Bc4+,b'rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/5n2/2p5/2Bq4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ -',As predicted. Too late for me to react to this now as it's way past midnight and I have to get up early for work tomorrow. To be continued.
288,6,13,e6,b'rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/4pn2/2p5/2Bq4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Protecting the King with the e pawn. White could castle and bring his rook into play on the half open file but my pawn is backed by the bishop and I could bring a piece or two out myself by then. I wanted to avoid a move like Ke1 because it would leave my king too exposed
289,6,14,Nc3,b'rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/4pn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Protects the rook and develops a piece.
290,6,15,Bd6,b'rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',"Reasons for this move : Develops a piece; the game is very open and the player with better development should have the advantage. Also it takes me a step closer to 'castling by hand' and takes my King to safety.
I would have loved to have been able to play Ng4 but there's a time and a place for everything.
Possible threats now : Nb5 I can deal with Qf3 gives me time to bring out my h1 rook Qe2 could have been a worry but my bishop at c1 is nicely placed to deal with that.
"
291,6,16,Qf3,b'rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN2Q2/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',9. Qf3. Let's see pins the knight and prevents my light squared bishop from moving with an eye on my b7 pawn. That's always a thing to remember when your opponent plays a queen move it can threaten multiple pieces or squares simultaneously and it's easy to miss out sometimes. The knight is well protected for the moment and I could play Nbd2 if necessary developing my Qside knight in the process. I could try Qe5  to ease the pressure a bit and see how my opponent reacts. He would most likely block the check with his bishop giving me time to bring out my rook and continue with my original plan of castling by hand.
292,6,17,1Be2,b'rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/P1PPBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',10. Be2 as expected. My queen move also prevents White from castling as O-O would be followed by Qxh2 . Time to bring my rook into play but where? One of the two half open files (f and d) or Re8?
293,6,18,1Rf8,b'rnb2r2/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/P1PPBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I choose Rf8 as it allows Nd5 (after I take my King to safety) which threatens White's Knight currently protecting the queenside rook while simultaneously attacking White’s Queen with my rook.
294,6,19,1Bb2,b'rnb2r2/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/PBPPBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I need to watch out for any discovered attacks on my queen now. But how soon do I need to respond to this threat? Do I have time to tuck away my King? What's the worst the Knight can do? And most importantly the Bishop itself is unprotected so a discovered attack may not be on the cards just yet. Another motive could be that my opponent plans to castle queenside and use a pawn storm to tear up whatever protection I have left for my King. I don't like this at all.
295,6,20,1Kg8,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/PBPPBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Safety first the King looks better protected and I manage to unpin my Knight. Must start preparing my response to O-O-O.
296,6,21,1O-O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/PBPPBPPP/2KR3R b - -',12.O-O-O. Let's see how this changes things. White's fianchettoed bishop is now protected and can threaten my queen. Let's see what my options are. I have three pieces that I haven't developed at all not a good idea in such an open game. The bishop and rook can't really move and are running out of oxygen. Nc6 looks like the only developing move. But what if 12… Nc6?  13. Nb5. Among other options an exchange of queens would suit me fine will have to find ways to force it. Something like Qf4 would be a step in that direction and would also take my queen out of the range of White's annoying darksquared bishop. But should I go for that now with so many pieces still undeveloped? 
297,6,22,1Qf4,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3bpn2/2p5/5q2/1PN2Q2/PBPPBPPP/2KR3R w - -',In the end I settle for Qf4. Getting White's queen out of the game or even forcing it to move away from the h1-a8 diagonal would allow me to develop my pieces. Of course White still has the option of replacing the queen on that diagonal with his lightsquared bishop.
298,6,23,1Qxf4,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3bpn2/2p5/5Q2/1PN5/PBPPBPPP/2KR3R b - -',Exchange of queens suits me fine as I am a piece ahead. Also reduces the pressure that was being exerted on my queen side pieces.
299,6,24,1Bxf4,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/4pn2/2p5/5b2/1PN5/PBPPBPPP/2KR3R w - -',Now let's see if the bishop replaces the queen on the long diagonal.
300,6,25,1g3,b'rnb2rk1/pp4pp/4pn2/2p5/5b2/1PN3P1/PBPPBP1P/2KR3R b - -',Bishop must move but what is the best square? Keeping it on this diagonal would be useful as it prevents White from pushing the d-pawn. However Bg5 or Bh6 could easily be blocked off with f4. In response I could try Nbd2 followed by e5. Worth a try.
301,6,26,1Bf3,b'r1b2rk1/pp1n2pp/4pn1b/2p5/5P2/1PN2BP1/PBPP3P/2KR3R b - -',I was afraid of that. Well time to open things up a bit more something along the lines of 16...e5  17 fxe5 Nxe5 which gives me some breathing space and gets rid of my isolated e-pawn.
302,6,27,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1n2pp/5n1b/2p1pP2/8/1PN2BP1/PBPP3P/2KR3R b - -',I don't like this. Next up I suppose he'll support it with g4. I'll take measures to advance my pawn anyway.
303,6,28,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n2pp/5n1b/2p1pP2/8/1PN2BP1/PBPP3P/2KR3R w - -',I'm not too happy with my position my extra piece hasn't meant anything so far must get to the endgame quickly.
304,6,29,1Nd5,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n2pp/5n1b/2pNpP2/8/1P3BP1/PBPP3P/2KR3R b - -',Threatening my f6 knight which is well protected by my knight on d2. I now have to find a way to prevent Nc7 which forks my rooks.
305,6,30,1Nxd5,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n2pp/7b/2pnpP2/8/1P3BP1/PBPP3P/2KR3R w - -',"I chose to exchange knights as :
It takes me closer to the endgame with two more pieces off the board and
I can now use my other knight as the blockader at f6.
"
306,6,31,1Bxd5+,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n2pp/7b/2pBpP2/8/1P4P1/PBPP3P/2KR3R b - -',Where should I move my King? I chose Kf8 as I was worried about the possibility of being cornered by the two bishops.
307,6,32,2g4,b'r1b1rk2/pp1n2pp/7b/2pBpP2/6P1/1P6/PBPP3P/2KR3R b - -',Now my knight move Nf6 looks nice forks White's bishop and pawn and blocks the f pawn. One thing to keep in mind is a future g5 by Baron which will fork my bishop and knight.
308,6,33,Bg5,b'r1b1rk2/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pPb1/6P1/1P3B2/PBPP3P/2KR3R w - -',So that when I play e4 if Baron tries Bxf6 I can retake with my bishop and replace one blockader with another.
309,6,34,Bf4,b'r1b1rk2/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pP2/5bPP/1P3B2/PBPP4/2KR3R w - -',What's next g5? That will weaken the f5 pawn though.
310,6,35,2Kb1,b'r1b1rk2/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pP2/5bPP/1P3B2/PBPP4/1K1R3R b - -',Makes it possible to advance the d pawn my bishops are beginning to look less useful I really haven't taken advantage of my extra piece. Baron's Knight sacrifice brought my King out and I've been under pressure since.
311,6,36,2Rb8,b'1rb1rk2/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pP2/5bPP/1P3B2/PBPP4/1K1R3R w - -',Looks like a clumsy and awkward move but I can't think of anything better at the moment. Advance the b pawn next and try to exchange the light squared bishops.
312,6,37,2g5,b'1rb1rk2/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pPP1/5b1P/1P3B2/PBPP4/1K1R3R b - -',Thought so the blockader must move now. Nd7 and I wait for Baron's next move. His f pawn is hanging. If he brings it forward the exchange gives him a passed pawn that is well advanced.
313,6,38,Kg8,b'1rb1r1k1/pp1n2pp/8/2p1pPP1/4Bb1P/1P6/PBPP4/1K1R3R w - -',Protect my own hanging pawn. It seems to me as though I've been reacting to Baron's moves for a long time rather then setting up some threats of my own. Hopefully things will change when my queenside pieces enter the play.
314,6,39,2d3,b'1rb1r1k1/pp1n2pp/8/2p1pPP1/4Bb1P/1P1P4/PBP5/1K1R3R b - -',New plan will attack the lightly protected f pawn with a discovered attack next move Rf8
315,6,40,Rf8,b'1rb2rk1/pp4pp/1n6/2p1pPP1/4Bb1P/1P1P4/PBP5/1K1R2R1 w - -',Continuing with my plan but I'm expecting Baron to play f6. Exchange of pawns my King's exposed not good.
316,6,41,2a4,b'1rb2rk1/pp4pp/1n6/2p1pPP1/P3Bb1P/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R2R1 b - a3',Return the knight to d7 and then start advancing my queenside pawns?
317,6,42,2Nd7,b'1rb2rk1/pp1n2pp/8/2p1pPP1/P3Bb1P/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R2R1 w - -',The knight does provide added protection to my isolated e pawn though.
318,6,43,2h5,b'1rb2rk1/pp1n2pp/8/2p1pPPP/P3Bb2/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R2R1 b - -',I'm seriously thinking about sacrificing a piece here the knight if it eases the pressure on my King. For example 29... Nf6. 30. gxf6   Rxf6. This could win White's f pawn for me as well so I'd be a pawn ahead with a Kingside pawn majority and closer to the end game. But what are my opponent's options? If he decides to advance his pawn rather than take my knight that suits me too as I can exchange my knight for his bishop and retain my piece advantage. I'll go for it.
319,6,44,2Nf6,b'1rb2rk1/pp4pp/5n2/2p1pPPP/P3Bb2/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R2R1 w - -',Awaiting Baron's response…in hindsight a better move may have been b6 but I was worried about the way my opponent's pawns were storming my already weakened King side defence. 
320,6,45,Bxf5,b'1r4k1/pp4pp/5r2/2p1pb1P/P3Bb2/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R1R2 w - -',I win the pawn but how do I respond to Bxe5? Will the resulting exchanges be favourable for me?
321,6,46,Bf5,b'1r4k1/pp4pp/5r2/2p1pb1P/P3Bb2/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R1R2 w - -',I notice the chance for the stalemate and go for it. I apologise for the anticlimax. My endgame is my weakest point it would have been good practice to continue on the other hand I was under a lot of pressure for a very long period and was relieved with the draw.
322,6,47,Bf5,b'1r4k1/pp4pp/5r2/2p1pb1P/P3Bb2/1P1P4/1BP5/1K1R1R2 w - -',Draw we share the points. I had an extra pawn with a kingside pawn advantage but I was under pressure from my opponent from a very early stage and was relieved to get the 1/2. 
323,7,0,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',Topalov signals his intention to play the Modern Benoni. His move order (2..e6 instead of 2..c5) is the current preference intending to meet 3.Nc3 with non-Benoni systems (i.e. 3...Bb4 and the Nimzo-Indian or 3...b6 and the QID). Black only plays 3..c5 when White has committed to 3.Nf3 which avoids the extremely potent Flick-Knife Attack involving an early f4.
324,7,1,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2N1P/PP2PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Entering the Modern Classical variation where White will continue with e4 and Bd3 and the struggle is slightly less explosive than the typical Flick-Knife encounter.
325,7,2,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The main position. White has overprotected e4 with Bd3 stymied the c8 bishop with an early h3 (preventing ..Bg4 and thereby cramping Black for a time - the c8 bishop has no natural development squares) and completed his kingside development.
326,7,3,b5,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pbp/3p1np1/1ppP4/4P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ b6',Black's most critical response this ..b5 sacrifice opens lines on the queenside and deflects a defender from e4. With White's king still in the center Black has many tactical possibilities along the e-file when White accepts the sac.
327,7,4,1Nxb5,b'rnbq1rk1/p4pbp/3p1np1/1NpP4/4P3/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The knight capture is considered White's most aggressive option as he aims to hold the pawn (or at least complicate Black's material situation). If Bxb5 Black typically responds ..Nxe4 followed by ..Qa5  when he picks up White's bishop to regain material equality. In that line White has a positional plus to exploit. Now if Black tries the same ..Qa5 trick the b5 knight retreats to c3 with the extra pawn in hand. Given this Black must play quickly to prove compensation or regain material equality which often involves wild and active play as in the game continuation.
328,7,5,1Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/p4pbp/3p1np1/1NpP4/4P3/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Quickly pressuring the abandoned e4 pawn. The immediate ..Nxe4? (intending a sacrifice as in the game continuation) results in difficulties after 11.Bxe4 Re8 12.Ng5! intending 12..h6 13.Ne6! and White turns the tables on Black's sacrifice with a dangerous offering of his own (e.g. 13...fxe6?? 14.dxe6 and the a8 rook is falling).
329,7,6,1Nd2,b'rnbqr1k1/p4pbp/3p1np1/1NpP4/4P3/3B3P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Supporting e4.

It's a fair and playable alternative but Black's hanging pawns (and d-pawn is backward) sit on open files and White must be doing well. Instead Topalov decides to exploit 1) White's temporary clog in development 2) Black's e-file pressure and White's exposed king with ..Nxe4!? Black sacrifices a knight for tremendous pressure on the White position...not exactly a novel idea in the Benoni but undeniably a risky fighting plan.

The text allows the simple Nxe8 but White is in serious trouble after Rxe8 and ..f5 winning the bishop and continuing great pressure on the White king (who's inability to castle makes the h1 rook useless in defense while Black's a8 rook has entered the game decisively)

336,7,13,1c4,b'4r1k1/p2n2bp/b5p1/q2P4/P1p1p3/R6P/1PQN1PP1/2BK3R w - -',A rare line and the beginning of Topalov's novelty. Objectively ...Bd3 is likely best (and the main line) when White must return the Exchange (the point of Ra3) via Rxd3 but here Topalov clears c5 for his knight (angling for the juicy outpost d3) and clamps down on the b3 square.

339,7,16,Rf8,b'5rk1/p2n2bp/b5p1/3q4/P1p1R3/7P/1PQN1PP1/2BK3R w - -',A terrific idea. ..Rxe4? is clearly bad as White weasels out of his bind with a large material advantage. Exchanges typically favor the defending player in these situations. Instead Topalov leaves the uncomfortable White piece at e4 and redirects along the f-file.

White's exposed king is telling as he will have trouble participating safely in defending the White pawns. It's not so useful to examine the endgame here so the rest is without notes. Black will use his rook to keep the White king away from the kingside pawns while manuevering his knight and king into winning position. Not as easy as it sounds.
342,7,19,Ne3,b'8/6Kp/6p1/7k/7P/4nP2/6P1/8 w - -',White resigns. The Black knight will pick up the stray White pawns and the g-pawn ultimately promotes. A fantastic game.

377,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',A sharp Kalashnikov where White tries a rare sideline and Black defends very well for a time but ultimately succumbs to a tricky idea from White. The jury is out on this variation after Black's very strong 8..Rg8!
378,10,1,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Introducing the modern Kalashnikov Sicilian which is basically a Sveshnikov setup without the 4..Nf6 5.Nc3 intermezzo. Black immediately lashes out in the center with tempo.
379,10,2,Bg5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -','!?' - The bishop is poison (of the Najdorf variety - ...Qxg5 is a fairly common try) but that is not all. This move initiates a sideline (used successfully by Velimirovic) designed to unbalance Black in the opening. Though not objectively best (c4 is critical) this move induces a pseudo-Sveshnikov position where White has not yet played Nc3. If not 6..Qxg5!? Black must play ...Nf6 (if ..Be7? 7. Bxe7 then Black must awkwardly recapture ..Kxe7 to avoid dropping the d-pawn; and ..f6 is somewhat ridiculous but similarly possible). More typical is 6.c4(!) initiating a positional stranglehold that is uniquely available in the Kalashnikov and considered bad for Black. It is also the reason many players prefer the Sveshnikov move order.
380,10,3,Bxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1B2/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -','!? or '?!' - This has been played by Topalov in his early days and White tends to score rather well but much of this owes to surprise value that to some extent is less valuable in corr chess. Still this initiates a doubled-pawn position White is familiar attacking from Sveshnikov play where f7 becomes a target and White plays for a quick attack.
381,10,4,Rg8,b'r1bqkbr1/pp3p1p/2np1p2/1N2p3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQq -','!' - Simplest and best seizing the open file and annoyingly attacking g2. It also prepares to defend f7 via a future ..Rg7. Certainly the strongest continuation for Black though it appears to be an original one.
382,10,5,Nd4,b'r1bqkb2/1p3prp/p2p1p2/4p2Q/2BnP3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQq -',Simple and solid. After ..b5-b4 there may be problems with the c2 square too in some variations.

If the d5 knight moves (threatening Qf7#) then Black can retreat ..Rg6! and White has gotten nowhere. Black's retreat covers f7 and threatens ..Rh6 driving off the White queen.
384,10,7,Bg4,b'r2qkb2/1p3p1p/p2p1p2/3Np2Q/2BnP1b1/N7/PPP2PrP/2KR3R w q -','!?' - Black goes in for further material gain. White must prove himself quickly. The immediate ..Rg6 was also possible though obviously not ..Rxf7? Qh4 and White is winning.
385,10,8,Bxd1,b'r2qkb2/1p3p1p/p2p1p2/3Np3/2BnP2Q/N7/PPP2PrP/2Kb3R w q -',Black must allow the discovered check after Nxf6  as something like ..Be7 allows Bf1 trapping the Black rook among other options.

387,10,10,1Nd5+,b'r2q1b2/1p2kp1p/p2p2r1/3Np3/2BnP2Q/N7/PPP2P1P/2KR4 b - -',An interesting aside is 17.Nxh7!? Kd7 18.Nxf8  Qxf8 19.f4! threatening the Black knight's d4 home and a pin  along the d-file if allowed to continue fxe5. Very much unclear.
388,10,11,1Qxh7,b'r2qkb2/1p3p1Q/p2p2r1/3Np3/2BnP3/N7/PPP2P1P/2KR4 b - -',A concession. White allows perpetual after ..Rh6 Qg8 Rg6. If he cannot pester the f7 square his attack will not get anywhere.
389,10,12,1Bh6+,b'r2qk3/1p3p1Q/p2p2rb/3Np3/2BnP3/N7/PPP2P1P/2KR4 w - -','?' - Black's move paves the way for White to attack f7 once again which cannot be good for the second player.

Nf4! introduces an ultra-sharp position where White is winning with accurate play which might continue  20..Rf6 21.Nh5 Rxf2 22.Qxh6 bxc4 23.Nxc4 when Black is up an Exchange but subject to a vicious winning attack as the knights occupy crucial (and often unassailable) holes in the Black position. The text relies on ..exf4?? Qh8  ( -) and as seen in the game continuation f4-f5 wins the rook with attack.
391,10,14,1b5,b'r2qk3/5p1Q/p2p2rb/1p1Np3/2BnPP2/N7/PPP4P/2KR4 w - b6',A solid intermezzo.

In fact Black's only move is 20..Bf8! defending against White's back-rank dreams and allowing ..Rh6 in the event of f5. ..Bf8 leads to a double-edged game.
393,10,16,2bxc4,b'r2qk3/5p1Q/p2p2rb/3Np3/2pnPP2/N7/PPP4P/1K1R4 w - -','??' - The game is over.

397,11,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',A natural but uncommon move. Other choices are 2. d4 or 2. Nf3 that lead to extensively studied positions.

511,15,4,b6,b'r2q1rk1/2pb2bp/np1p1ppn/3Pp3/1PP1P2B/2NN4/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',He is aiming to stop my queen-side advance. Perhaps he should've been focusing more on his king-side play.
512,15,5,Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/2pb2bp/np1p1ppn/3Pp3/1PP1P2B/2NN4/R3BPPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Good move his queen works both sides well and also removes the pin and to allow his f5 king-side attack

514,15,7,2Bf2,b'r1q2rk1/2pb1nbp/np1p2p1/1N1Ppp2/1PP1P3/3N1P2/R3BBPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',All of white's pieces are now pointing to the queen-side but black has not managed to organize a king-side attack quite yet

518,15,11,Ne6,b'r5k1/1q3nbp/3pn1p1/4p3/1PP5/2NN1P2/5B1P/3Q1RK1 w - -',Nice redeployment of the night narrowing down on the central light squares paralyzing black's centeral pawns and the dark-squared bishop
519,15,12,3Qxd5,b'r5k1/5nbp/6p1/2NQp3/1qP5/5P2/5B1P/5RK1 b - -',Pretty shaky position here for me. Luckily tactics worked in my favor here.
520,15,13,3Qe6,b'3r2k1/5nbp/4Q1p1/2N1p3/1qP5/5P2/5B1P/5RK1 b - -',Keeping the knight pinned is important here

522,15,15,Rd3,b'6k1/1N3nbp/4Q1p1/4p3/2P5/2qr1P2/5B1P/5RK1 w - -',A mistake. Black must keep white's queen from invading on the back rank. Although it's hard to find a good spot for the rook. If Rb8 then Ba7 if Rf8 then Bc4. Perhaps Ra8 was the better spot for the rook
523,15,16,Nd6,b'4Qbk1/1N5p/3n2p1/2B1p3/2P5/2qr1P2/7P/5RK1 w - -',Only move
524,15,17,4Qc8,b'2Q2bk1/7p/3q2p1/4p3/2P5/5P2/6KP/5R2 b - -',So white won an exchange and is better in this end-game but there is still a lot of work and dangers remain. Qc8 is a good move as it protects the important g4 square.
525,15,18,4Qg4,b'5bk1/7p/6p1/4p1q1/2P3Q1/5P2/5RKP/8 b - -',Here's the point of 40. Qc8
526,15,19,Kg7,b'5b2/6kp/4Q1p1/4p3/2P5/4qP2/5RKP/8 w - -',Here I tried lots of different path's but nothing seemed to work as black always had a chance to go into checking frenzy on the white king.
527,15,20,4Rb2,b'5b2/6kp/4Q1p1/4p3/2P5/4qP2/1R4KP/8 b - -',Good move it still protects white's 2nd rank from queen's checks and threatens Rb7
528,15,21,Qxg4+,b'5b2/6kp/6p1/4p3/2P3q1/5P2/1R4KP/8 w - -',?! Making white's job that much easier. 
529,15,22,Kf7,b'5b2/5k1p/6p1/4p3/2P3P1/8/1R4KP/8 w - -',And here a nice final touch
530,15,23,4Rf2+,b'5b2/5k1p/6p1/4p3/2P3P1/8/5RKP/8 b - -',Keeping the king stuck in the corner or else blocking the bishop from stopping the white's passed pawn
531,15,24,4Rxf8+,b'4kR2/7p/6p1/2P1p3/6P1/8/6KP/8 b - -',! This key deflection gives white the one extra move that he needs to penetrate black's position

670,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',in an attack a pawn can do great things when it snakes it's way towards the enemy king it can support key squares to help mate it can even sneak through and queen: it can also do both.  That's one half of Shirov's attack but there's another part: pieces that flow towards the enemies king heedless of losses.
671,21,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I'm going to skim over the opening black offers a gambit white declines.  Both sides develop but white gets a space advantage on BOTH sides of the board.
672,21,2,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq b6',Black had no desire to get blown out in this game he plays the active and dangerous Benko Gambit.  Black sacrifices his wing pawns to open files for his rooks to pressure white's game.  It's one of the very few gambits where the pawn is not sacrificed for an immediate attack but for long term positional pressure.
673,21,3,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/p4n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The natural continuation white wants a great square on a6 for his bishop and to use the a & b files.
674,21,4,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/pP3n2/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White declines the gambit.
675,21,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/4pppp/pP1p1n2/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',No need to regain the pawn immediately.

677,21,7,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/2qnppbp/p2p1np1/P1pP4/2B1PP2/2N2N2/1P4PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black has basically concluded development and he's getting mighty scared of that e5 pawn push where the e and d pawns will storm forward.  Black prepares to play his own e5 pawn push.
678,21,8,1Ng5,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn2bp/p2ppnp1/P1p3N1/2B1PP2/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now the middlgame has started white sees a target on the e6 square.  White goes for that target as he brings his pieces to the kingside.
679,21,9,1Nf8,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3bp/p2ppnp1/P1p3N1/2B1PP2/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The best move both the bishop and the knight now cover e6 and the knight controls the targets on g6 and h7.
680,21,10,1f5,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3bp/p2ppnp1/P1p2PN1/2B1P3/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Black's e pawn is pinned to his king white sees the and sends his f pawn marching forward attacking the pinned pawn.
681,21,11,1h6,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3b1/p2ppnpp/P1p2PN1/2B1P3/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black gets afraid and kicks the knight out this is a natural response but look at black's pawns.  There's the thing people always say about how pawns can't move backwards so you shouldn't advance them when you don't have to.  It's true black's pawns are all advanced which creates all kind of weak squares it also means that none of his kingside pawns defend each other.  Also black's development to the back rank is quite miserable.  White has all the play all the activity all the hopes for a win.  This is definitely not what black wanted when he played the Benko Gambit.  And all his advantages lead up to the following flow of combinations.
682,21,12,1e5,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3b1/p2ppnpp/P1p1PPN1/2B5/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White plays to open lines.  Lets take a step back from the kingside and look at the center the centers his knights and bishops control.  White's key squares are e4 and d5.  White is opening up the game and opening up squares for his pieces.
683,21,13,1dxe5,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3b1/p3pnpp/P1p1pPN1/2B5/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black must take the pawn giving Shirov access to the d file as 17... hxg5 18.exf6 where black's g pawn falls next will be awful for black.
684,21,14,1fxg6,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3b1/p3pnPp/P1p1p1N1/2B5/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',An excellent move white is willing to to part with his knight to get an incredible pawn on g6.  The pawn cramps black and gives Shirov access to the perfect square... h7.
685,21,15,1Bxg5,b'r1b1rnk1/2q3b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N5/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The knight's on f6 and f8 are black's best defensive pieces so white threatens to get rid of one.
686,21,16,1Nf8d7,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N5/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black must defend his knight but this moves the knight away from the defense.  With a set of pawn sacrifices (especially the e pawn sac on move 17) white now has the d and f files open and they just happen to be the files where all black's defensive pieces are.  Also white has the only pawn next to black's king.  The question is how to bring the queen to the h file (and also off the d file so a rook can go there) and the answer comes back to the squares that the e pawn sacrifice opened up.
687,21,17,2Qf3,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N2Q2/1P4PP/R4RK1 b - -',The perfect answer 17.e5! opened up the a8-h1 diagonal and white wins a tempo there against the rook before heading over to h3.
688,21,18,2Qa7,b'r1b1r1k1/q2n2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N2Q2/1P4PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black defends the rook but surely 20...Rb8 counterattacking the b pawn is better?  However white has a stunning sacrifice coming up that attacks the c7 square so maybe he should move the queen but in that case I think b7 must be a better square for the queen (as it offers a queen trade).
689,21,19,2Rad1,b'r1b1r1k1/q2n2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N2Q2/1P4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White grabs the file with the threat of 22.Rxd7! Bxd7 23.Bxf6 or 22... Nxd7 23.Qf7  where white picks off the rook and will probably mate in a few moves.  Not only is h7 covered by the pawn but f7 is another important square that the g6 pawn covers.
690,21,20,2Qb7,b'r1b1r1k1/1q1n2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N2Q2/1P4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black offers the queen trade which for the moment stops 22.Rxd7.
691,21,21,2Qh3,b'r1b1r1k1/1q1n2b1/p3pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N4Q/1P4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',White shuttles to the h file not only threatening all sorts of combinations on h7 but also this hits e6.
692,21,22,2Qc6,b'r1b1r1k1/3n2b1/p1q1pnP1/P1p1p1B1/2B5/2N4Q/1P4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',So black defends e6 once again taking the passive role he's taken the ENTIRE game since his gambit was declined.
693,21,23,2Nd5,b'r1b1r1k1/3n2b1/p1q1pnP1/P1pNp1B1/2B5/7Q/1P4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',A beautiful sacrifice.  While this is a wonderful move doesn't the simpler 23.Bxf6 work?  Well 23.Bxf6 Nf8 24.Bxg7 Kxg7 where 25.Rxf8  seems the natural way to continue 25... Kxf8 26.Qh8  Ke7 27.Qg7# so what about 25... Rxf8 26.Qh7  Kf6 27.Rf1  Kg5 28.h4  Kg4 29.Be2  Kg3 30.Bf3! where Ne2# is threatened.  So I don't see why he didn't choose this line except that this win is FAR nicer looking.  I think 23.Rxf6 works too but oh well.  If someone would like to enlighten me on a defense for black I'd like to see it.  I think those win but this is more enjoyable to play.
694,21,24,2Rxd5,b'r1b1r1k1/3n2b1/p1q2nP1/P1pRp1B1/2B5/7Q/1P4PP/5RK1 b - -',The point of the knight sacrifice black cannot with the knight because of Qh7# and now with the e pawn gone Shirov's bishop is aiming right at black's king.
695,21,25,2Kf8,b'r1b1rk2/3n2b1/p1q2nP1/P1pRp1B1/2B5/7Q/1P4PP/5RK1 w - -',Black evacuates the a2-g8 diagonal but the g8 square is weak and white brings another piece to bear on it.
696,21,26,2Qh7,b'r1b1rk2/3n2bQ/p1q2nP1/P1pRp1B1/2B5/8/1P4PP/5RK1 b - -',Black is now forced to shut down the a2-g8 diagonal at all costs the threats revolving around rook sacrifices (to open the bishop) on g8 are too scary.
697,21,27,2Re6,b'r1b2k2/3n2bQ/p1q1rnP1/P1pRp1B1/2B5/8/1P4PP/5RK1 w - -',So the rook blocks the diagonal.
698,21,28,2Bh6,b'r1b2k2/3n2bQ/p1q1rnPB/P1pRp3/2B5/8/1P4PP/5RK1 b - -',White now wins the g7 bishop because 26... Bxh6 27.Qf7#

801,25,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game took place in Reykjavik in 1992 between the incredible attacker Shirov (who is Latvian like Tal!  They've done a lot of analysis together) and a GM from Iceland.  It features the Shabalov attack which like the Botvinnik (see my previously analyzed games) is a fearless and wild way to try to storm the semi-slav.  I will primarily try to explain ideas and plans instead of lots of variations though there will be some of those too.  My analysis is not aided by computers and if people have thoughts I'd love to hear them.

Generally I prefer the botvinnik as 5.Bg5 is a much more explosive dangerous move and it seems more natural to put the bishop outside of the pawn chain.  However in the Shabalov attack white attempts to put a pawn on g5 and storm the kingside.  Such aggresive ideas demand a kind of bloody-minded respect.

Hundreds of years ago players used to play things like king's gambit sacrificing the f pawn modern GMs have moved on to sacrificing the g pawn.  The idea behind this frightening pawn push is either to gain a half open g file (even the h file after 7... Nxg4 8.Rg1 Nxh2) or to push the pawn to g5 where it drives away black's best piece the knight on f6.
807,25,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/2PP2P1/2N1PN2/PPQ2P1P/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',I'm not sure if I would call this move brave... or foolhardy.  Black (by choice) steps into white's attack.  To me this move looks like walking no running right into the attack.

Instead black tries to trade down hoping to defuse the attack.  This plan is unsuccessful because he isn't trading white's attacking pieces merely a queenside knight.  Apparently Thorhallsson spent a huge amount of time on this move and he couldn't find an adequate defense to 13.h4.
820,25,19,1Bd3,b'r1b1qrk1/pp1n2p1/2p1pn1p/3p2N1/1bPP3P/2NBP3/PPQB1P2/2KR3R b - -',White builds against black's weak light squares.

The rest of the game is a bit slower than the opening white maneuvers to create a pawn break through and black strives for counterplay while attempting to stop white's threats.  Personally I'm a tactical player who loves to attack.  Most of my attacks come from a spatial advantage (especially when white).  Thus for me this is a dream position white has all the space he could ask for an is well on the way to a win with his attack.

And his extra piece is doing nothing of f8.  For that matter the c8 bishop is useless one rook is locked out of the game and the other (on f7) cannot be envied.  Even the queen is doing little.  On the other hand white's pawn are a storm his rooks support them perfectly and his bishop has suddenly come into the game.
838,25,37,Bd7,b'r2k1n2/pp1b1rp1/4p1q1/3P2P1/4PP1Q/2B5/PP6/2KRR3 w - -',An attempt to shut the d file down.

When the king was on g8 it did a great job on h4 but now that square has lost value.  This move also stops the f pawns from advancing to f2.  Another option is 31.e7  Kc7 32.d6  Kd7 and the king finds some safety on the light squares 33.exf8=Q Raxf8 and white has lost his wonderful pawn for a mere knight 34.Re7  Kb8 yeah this probably wins but the following seems more convincing to me.

Shirov first launched a wild pawn gambit it was declined and so instead he sacrificed a piece to open line against black's king this was converted into two pawns for the piece and a spatial advantage which he retained throughout he turned this into two spectacular attacking passed pawns with rooks supporting them by sacrificing another pawn and quite soon he had won.  I think this is a great example of an attack that went on for 31 moves from 7.g4 to mate.  Throughout the game the advantages white held constantly converted between different attacking positional advantages.  I'd recommend taking a second quick look at the game from black's point of view to watch the attack come to you.  I hope you enjoyed the game and I'd love to get PMed if you have thoughts criticisms or ideas.

This variation usually yields White a small advantage.

Sveshnikov's innovation 8...b5! is absolutely best and this rickety old move which has been abandoned entirely for 2 decades gives White too much time in the center.

White's 3.Nc3 is positionally dubious locking in the c-pawn and allowing Black to play ..d5 with strong central control. Note how Black dominates the central light squares. If allowed he will contest the dark squares via ..Bg7 ..Na6/..Nbd7 and ultimately ..c5/..e5 etc. Black threatens an edge already.

This inaccuracy is no doubt related to Black's proclivity for playing many games concurrently (and fast-playing the less taxing ones) a habit he has since halted.

When I reached this position I remember thinking that this was like something that you would do when you were just learning chess or like a chess puzzle. But notice that white still has the advantage because of the poor placing of Blacks rook on h6. It is completely immobile.

It was an interesting game and it removed my nerves for the rest of the tournament. Unfortunately though the rest of my team lost their games.
1071,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here is a recent league game I just completed. With the black pieces I foolishly isolate my king with very little cover - throwing all of my resources towards a queenside attack. My opponent punishes me severely for this and ultimately threatens mate in quick order. As I joked with him during the game I was prepared to throw everything - including the kitchen sink:) - into an effort for a draw! Lo and behold it worked! This game reinforced an old chess adage to me which is NEVER GIVE UP! Here we go.....my opponent opens with the very standard and solid 1.e4.
1072,33,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',OK - no more jokes about me playing the Scandi. For those that know me this is no surprise. I think my good friend blackbaron could write the scouting report on me - he has seen it enough:) My opponent in this game vegiemite handles my attempt to rip open the center quite well by playing....
1073,33,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"2.e5 - declining the ""gambit"" pawn and the dangers associated with it. In this version white pushes e5 and plans for a BIG center."
1074,33,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The logical reply. Black clamps down on the d4 square and clears space on c6 for roomy development of his Nb8.
1075,33,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White claims the big center which makes sense. The danger here for white however is the possibility of black having two center pawns should exchanges occur - not deadly for him but tricky to manage if not played correctly.
1076,33,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black attempts to claim the central pawn advantage - albeit on his own side of the board.
1077,33,6,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White obviously maintains material equality. Again this move is somewhat dangerous as his queen is now open to a developmental attack should black respond 4...Nb6.
1078,33,7,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/3pP3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',! Having seen this position numerous times black is well aware that 4...Nb6 is weak due to the vulnerability of the light colored squares. White stands better after 4...Nb6 5. Bb4 delivering a pin that is extremely strong.
1079,33,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/3pP3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Interesting - a more usual response is 5. Nf3. I began to wonder if a sac on b5 was in my future......

1082,33,11,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3Q1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Sufficiently satisfied that any attack on the light squares could be repelled black develops with tempo.

1084,33,13,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',This move accomplishes several things - it develops (with a pin) it clears a square for the Ng8 to develop to and it hastens 0-0.

1089,33,18,1a3,b'r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/P1NQ4/1PPB2PP/2KR1BNR b kq -',?! Not too sure about this one - kingside development makes more sense. Has white changed his mind and opted for a queenside attack? or has he just weakened his castled position? I must say I was confused. In this war of psychology I am definitely being toyed with:) If you are scoring at home award vegiemite 10 style points:)
1090,33,19,1Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1bQ4/1PPB2PP/2KR1BNR w kq -',"Thinking that white's dark squared bishop won't be too dangerous on c3 because of his pawn on e5 black takes out the Nc3.  I remember thinking that the early 6.f4 by white may have just been a feint as a big push on the queenside would be painful for me should I eventually play 0-0 - which could be very cramped indeed. Then I started counting pawns and swearing that he started the game with more than I did! It seems that white is poised to push on EITHER side of the board and my so called ""advantage"" of central pawns was strictly an illusion. 10 more style points to vegiemite:)!"
1091,33,20,1Bxc3,b'r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1BQ4/1PP3PP/2KR1BNR b kq -',Of course.

I am really playing off of my heels at this point as I have NO IDEA as to where the attack is going to come from and I'll need as many defensive resources as I can get. White is in control even with his lack of kingside development.
1093,33,22,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/1pqbnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1BQ1N2/1PP3PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',Logical albeit a little late development.

Sometimes a coin flip is all you have:) While that is HORRIBLE technical advice that is precisely the situation I found myself in. I simply could not wait any longer for white to reveal his plan to me. I had to make a commitment to get some sort of idea as to what MY plan was going to be. As it turned out I probably chose incorrectly as my commitment to attacking on the queenside is easily rebuffed. Give vegiemite another 10 points for forcing me into an ugly decision:)

Perhaps he saw something that I didn't. What I see in this position is the opportunity to clear pieces - which makes sense to me as I'm the one with the cramped position.
1096,33,25,1Nxd4,b'r4rk1/1pqbnppp/p3p3/3pP3/3n1P2/P1BQ4/1PP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',I oblige hoping to open up the scope of my light squared bishop.

My opponent is in my head big time.
1098,33,27,1Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/1pqbnppp/p3p3/3pP3/3B1P2/P2Q4/1PP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',Black is committed to play along the queenside. White can go either way. Advantage white.

Since white must cede back a little tempo to protect his Rd2 black begins toying with some sacrificing ideas to take advantage of the fact that white has still not developed his Bf1 (which by definition still blocks in his Rh1). If played correctly black now has the opportunity to start being the aggressor.
1105,33,34,1Rd1,b'r1r3k1/1pqb1ppp/p3p3/3pP3/2nB1P2/P1PQ4/1PK3PP/3R1B1R b - -',Obviously seeing the potentail dangers ahead white retreats to the 1st rank to get some support behind his pawns.

1108,33,37,1b5,b'r1r3k1/2qb1ppp/4p3/pp1pP3/2nB1PP1/P1PQ4/1PK4P/3R1B1R w - b6',Let's take a moment to analyze the whole board - the battle lines have finally been drawn 100%. White is going to attack on the kingside black on the queenside. Space is roughly equal. Pawn structure favors white. Piece placement favors black. White is behind in development but black has some serious worries regarding the safety of his king. This is going to very painful for SOMEBODY!
1109,33,38,2Qh3,b'r1r3k1/2qb1ppp/4p3/pp1pP3/2nB1PP1/P1P4Q/1PK4P/3R1B1R b - -',! I failed to see how powerful this move is and paid for it big time.

1114,33,43,2Nxe5,b'2r3k1/2qb1p1p/r3p1p1/pp1pnP2/3B2P1/P1PB3Q/1PK4P/3R3R w - -',!? Whoa...black preserves his pawn shield for the moment and is prepared to play Nxg after white plays f6. This move also opens the door to other sac opportunities if there is time to play b4! If white captures on e5 then black will have won a pawn after QxB. This is a very complex position no doubt. I remember thinking that one of us was surely going to have a story to tell after this game. I am extending an open invitation to all to comment and critique this position. I am especially interested in a critique of my 22...Nxe5.
