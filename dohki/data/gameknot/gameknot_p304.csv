0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Solohawk and I have played many times and although he can play several openings he tends to play more e4 than anything else. I used to answer e4 with Petrov's Defense but more recently have played ...e5.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',There is a good chance we will end up in a Ruy Lopez but he is capable of playing several other choices as well.
2,0,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And a Ruy it is.
3,0,3,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I always play Morphy's 3...a6 but of course it is not required.
4,0,4,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The only move listed in MCO-13 but I believe I have seen analysis that shows 4. Bc4 is playable. I am too poor to afford an MCO-14 :)
5,0,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The main line although I have played the Accelerated Counterthrust Variation with 4...b5. Also playable is the Modern Steinitz Defense with 4...d6.
6,0,6,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is a very timid move that surrenders any hope of keeping the opening white initiative. The main line is 5. O-O.
7,0,7,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',"It is probably better to attack white's center with 5...d5 but I wasn't sure I liked the line:
5...d5
6. exd5 Qxd5 (...Nxd5 will drop the e pawn after the trade on c6)
7. Bxc6  bxc6
8. Nc3
The text forces white's bishop onto a nice diagonal but I will try to deal with that shortly."
8,0,8,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',Better late than never. In an e4 opening black's goal is to get in ...d5 without it conceding anything to white. I believe with this move black has achieved equality.
9,0,9,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp1B1/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Creating complicating tactics but with Solohawk I will always try to trade queens and head for an endgame.
10,0,10,dxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p1B1/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',And so I hope for 8. dxe4 when I can trade the queens off.
11,0,11,Bxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2B2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I assume this is an attempt to decoy my queen as recapturing with the pawn will break up my kingside.
12,0,12,gxf6,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',But that is a price I am willing to pay in order to get the queens off.
13,0,13,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Neglecting the fact that his knight was en prise.
14,0,14,exf3,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1p2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',So I am happy to win a piece.
15,0,15,1Qxf3,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Threatening a nasty fork with Qxc6 .
16,0,16,1Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/2p2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',Which I totally overlook because I am so anxious to get castled.
17,0,17,1Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/2p2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',But then he fails to pull the trigger on his threat.
18,0,18,1Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1bp2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',And I finally realize the danger and deal with it. The second reason for this move it to play 12...Na5 with a discovery on the queen that will allow me to trade off white's bishop.
19,0,19,1a4,b'r2qk2r/1bp2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/P7/1BNP1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq a3',A curious move that seems out of place. I think centralizing the rooks was probably a better choice.
20,0,20,1Na5,b'r2qk2r/1bp2pbp/p4p2/np2p3/P7/1BNP1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',And I am able to complete my plan to get rid of his light squared bishop.
21,0,21,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/2p2pbp/p4p2/np1Np3/P7/3P1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I feel much better with my king out of the center. Although my pawn structure is far from perfect I am up a piece and feel the game is won.
22,0,22,1Nb4,b'r2q1rk1/2p2pbp/p4p2/np2p3/PN6/3P1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I have no explanation for this move. Again I think centralizing the rooks is better.
23,0,23,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p4p2/npp1p3/PN6/3P1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - c6',Trying to gain space. The knight has few squares to go to. At a2 it is out of play at d5 is wastes two tempii going back to the square it just came from and at c6 I will trade it off as I am up material.
24,0,24,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p1N2p2/npp1p3/P7/3P1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And white allows the trade of pieces.
25,0,25,1Nxc6,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p1n2p2/1pp1p3/P7/3P1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Which I gladly accept.
26,0,26,Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/5pbp/p1Q2p2/1pp1p3/P7/3P4/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',And now I need to protect the c pawn as well as try to get the queens off.
27,0,27,1Qe4,b'r1q2rk1/5pbp/p4p2/1pp1p3/P3Q3/3P4/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Of course he doesn't want to trade the queens so he leaves his queen centralized for further maneuvers.
28,0,28,1f5,b'r1q2rk1/5pbp/p7/1pp1pp2/P3Q3/3P4/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I am trying to open the long diagonal so my bishop will have some scope. Of course the fact that his rook is still on a1 makes this even more enticing.
29,0,29,1Qe2,b'r1q2rk1/5pbp/p7/1pp1pp2/P7/3P4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',A reasonable square; trying to keep the queen as centralized as possible.
30,0,30,1Qe6,b'r4rk1/5pbp/p3q3/1pp1pp2/P7/3P4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Preparing ...e4 to complete the plan of bringing my bishop to life.
31,0,31,2a5,b'r4rk1/5pbp/p3q3/Ppp1pp2/8/3P4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',No explanation for this move.
32,0,32,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/p3q3/Ppp1pp2/8/3P4/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now that the a file will remain closed there is no reason to leave a rook on it so I reposition to support the push ...c4.
33,0,33,2b3,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/p3q3/Ppp1pp2/8/1P1P4/2P1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',And white defends the c4 square but in the process opens the long diagonal for my bishop.
34,0,34,2e4,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/p3q3/Ppp2p2/4p3/1P1P4/2P1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',And I take advantage of the discovered attack on the rook to get in the pawn push.
35,0,35,2Rae1,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/p3q3/Ppp2p2/4p3/1P1P4/2P1QPPP/4RRK1 b - -',I think I would have preferred Rad1 because after black's next move the rook ends up there anyway and the text gives black a tempo to invade with the bishop.
36,0,36,exd3,b'2r2rk1/5p1p/p3q3/Ppp2p2/8/1Pbp4/2P1QPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Always looking to trade the queens.
37,0,37,2Qxe6,b'2r2rk1/5p1p/p3Q3/Ppp2p2/8/1Pbp4/2P2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',And he finally obliges.
38,0,38,2fxe6,b'2r2rk1/7p/p3p3/Ppp2p2/8/1Pbp4/2P2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',This also straightens out my pawns for the endgame.
39,0,39,2Rxd3,b'2r2rk1/7p/p3p3/Ppp2p2/8/1PbR4/2P2PPP/5RK1 b - -',Gaining tempo against the bishop to double rooks on the d file.
40,0,40,2b4,b'2r2rk1/7p/p3p3/P1p2p2/1p6/1PbR4/2P2PPP/5RK1 w - -',I was tempted to play 25...Bxa5 but after 26. Ra1 white wins back the a pawn and I wanted to keep the lines closed for the time being.
41,0,41,2Rd6,b'2r2rk1/7p/p2Rp3/P1p2p2/1p6/1Pb5/2P2PPP/5RK1 b - -',A double attack on the a and e pawns.
42,0,42,2Rfe8,b'2r1r1k1/7p/p2Rp3/P1p2p2/1p6/1Pb5/2P2PPP/5RK1 w - -',I choose to protect the e pawn as after 27. Rxa6 I can either win back the a pawn or force a trade of rooks with 27...Ra8.
43,0,43,Rxa5,b'4r1k1/7p/3Rp3/r1p2p2/1p6/1Pb5/2P2PPP/5RK1 w - -',And that is the way it plays out.
44,0,44,2Rc6,b'4r1k1/7p/2R1p3/r1p2p2/1p6/1Pb5/2P2PPP/5RK1 b - -',It is hard to find a plan for white here but I think doubling on the d file was probably necessary to make any kind of progress.
45,0,45,2Kf7,b'4r3/5k1p/2R1p3/r1p2p2/1p6/1Pb5/2P2PPP/5RK1 w - -',Protecting the e pawn to free the rook. Also activating the king as we are approaching the endgame.
46,0,46,3h4,b'4r3/5k1p/2R1p3/r1p2p2/1p5P/1Pb5/2P2PP1/5RK1 b - h3',White has no useful moves but if he isn't to resign he must play something.
47,0,47,3Rd8,b'3r4/5k1p/2R1p3/r1p2p2/1p5P/1Pb5/2P2PP1/5RK1 w - -',And now black has control of both open files on the board. White should not have allowed this.
48,0,48,Kg6,b'3r4/2R4p/4p1k1/r1p2p2/1p5P/1Pb5/2P2PP1/5RK1 w - -',Keeping everything protected while advancing.
49,0,49,3f3,b'3r4/2R4p/4p1k1/r1p2p2/1p5P/1Pb2P2/2P3P1/5RK1 b - -',Probably to prepare g4.
50,0,50,3Rd2,b'8/2R4p/4p1k1/r1p2p2/1p5P/1Pb2P2/2Pr2P1/5RK1 w - -',And black invades on the open file to attack the base of white's pawn chain.
51,0,51,3g4,b'8/2R4p/4p1k1/r1p2p2/1p4PP/1Pb2P2/2Pr4/5RK1 b - g3',Ignoring the threat to c2 white attempts to find counterplay on the kingside.
52,0,52,3h5,b'8/2R5/4p1k1/r1p2p1p/1p4PP/1Pb2P2/2Pr4/5RK1 w - h6',"33...fxg4
34. fxg4
would leave the e pawn isolated give white a 2-1 majority and open the f file for white's rook. The text does give white a protected passed g pawn but it is on a dark square and I can sacrifice my bishop for it if necessary. To me that is the lesser of the evils."
53,0,53,3g5,b'8/2R5/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p5P/1Pb2P2/2Pr4/5RK1 b - -',And white achieves the protected passed pawn but will he be able to break the blockade so it can advance?
54,0,54,3Rd4,b'8/2R5/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p1r3P/1Pb2P2/2P5/5RK1 w - -',Rather than take the inconsequential c pawn I attack the vulnerable protector of the passer.
55,0,55,3Rc8,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p1r3P/1Pb2P2/2P5/5RK1 b - -',Don't know what the point of this is. I think white's best chance is 35. f4 but after 35...Bd2 it is hard to find a good plan for white.
56,0,56,3Rxh4,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p5r/1Pb2P2/2P5/5RK1 w - -',Undermining the passed pawn.
57,0,57,3Rd1,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p5r/1Pb2P2/2P5/3R2K1 b - -',Putting the rook on an open file but it is too little too late.
58,0,58,3Bd4+,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P5/3R2K1 w - -',Blocking the file and protecting the c pawn so the rook on a5 is freed to move.
59,0,59,3Kg2,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/r1p2pPp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P3K1/3R4 b - -',Getting closer to the expected action on the kingside.
60,0,60,3Ra1,b'2R5/8/4p1k1/2p2pPp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P3K1/r2R4 w - -',Forcing a rook trade as moving the rook along the d file allows ...Rg1#.
61,0,61,3Rc6,b'8/8/2R1p1k1/2p2pPp/1p5r/1P3P2/2P3K1/b7 b - -',I don't know why white doesn't take the c pawn here.
62,0,62,3Bd4,b'8/8/2R1p1k1/2p2pPp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P3K1/8 w - -',And now it is protected.
63,0,63,4Rxe6+,b'8/8/4R1k1/2p2pPp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P3K1/8 b - -',So white takes the e pawn instead.
64,0,64,4Kxg5,b'8/8/4R3/2p2pkp/1p1b3r/1P3P2/2P3K1/8 w - -',And now I have to focus on advancing my own passed pawn.
65,0,65,4Kg3,b'8/8/4R3/2p2pkp/1p1b3r/1P3PK1/2P5/8 b - -',Don't know what this is for.
66,0,66,4f4+,b'8/8/4R3/2p3kp/1p1b1p1r/1P3PK1/2P5/8 w - -',And the blunder that turns a win into a draw. I should have played 41...Rh1 but now the rook is trapped.
67,0,67,4Kg2,b'8/8/4R3/2p3kp/1p1b1p1r/1P3P2/2P3K1/8 b - -',And from here white can draw by using his rook to cut off black's king from the queenside pawns. For example moving the rook between d1 and d3 makes it impossible for black to make progress. White's pawns guard all the light entry squares and the only way for the bishop to block the d file from white's rook is to put it on d4. But d4 is the only dark square black's king can use to invade the queenside. Notice that white's king is perfectly placed on a light square so that it is safe from both black's rook and bishop.
68,0,68,4Kf5,b'8/8/4R3/2p2k1p/1p1b1p1r/1P3P2/2P3K1/8 w - -',Nevertheless I play on as Solohawk may not realize he has a drawing method.

115,2,19,1dxe3,b'rnr3k1/4bppp/5n2/p4p2/PpN5/1P2pN2/1B3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I'll accept the sacrifice.  Nb6 looks good but after Rc2! ( not exf right away) I'm winning but its a bit double edged.  (In some variations a later BC5 is a killer move for Black)
116,2,20,1Nxe3,b'rnr3k1/4bppp/5n2/p4p2/Pp6/1P2NN2/1B3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',OK - so the enemy has eschewed the tactics of Nb6 and made the pawn sacrifice a postional one.  I've got my extra pawn but my advanced pawn is weak  B on e7 is vulnerable (but required to avoid hopeless tripled pawns) .  Can I play g6 here and take a permanent dark-square weakness?

White's positional sac is fully justified as he will win the pawn back with a plus (at least doubling/isolating all blacks K-side pawns)  The position for black is bad but is it desparate yet ?

430,18,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',My usual opening - English if i'm not mistaken. The idea is still the same as English - controlling the d5 square and focusing on claiming the white squares early.
431,18,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A usual retort. Controlling the black squares in the middle usually followd by either 2.. Nc6 or 2.. Bc5
432,18,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Still focusing on the white squares. The reason why i love this opening is because its not directly confrontational but sort of pre-emptive
433,18,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black took the 2.. Bc5 approach. Looks like the start of trying to control the centre. Restricts my usual 3.d4 move.
434,18,4,e3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2P5/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Backing up for 4.d4 and at the same time supporting the lone pawn on c4 with my white bishop. However this is a very slow move as it doesn't really develop my position and ultimately restricts the movement of my Black bishop
435,18,5,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black has developed quite well here. He's now ready to castle early and now has control over the d4 square and challenging control over e4 and d5 squares.
436,18,6,d4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',This move has a few purposes. Firstly i am now trying to gain control over the e5 square by attacking it and then later on bring forth my knight on f3. Also i'm now allowing some breathing space for my black bishop if 4.. exd4 5exd4 Bg5
437,18,7,Qe7+,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/2b5/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Can't protect with the queen cos pawn on d4 is under threat.
438,18,8,Be3,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/2b5/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',There's a reason why i picked this move. Right now the centre is totally controlled by my pieces. d5 and e5 has two pieces controlling it and now i have mobility to a few of my key pieces. And now d4 is not really under too much threat as it has been eliviated by the bishop
439,18,9,Bb6,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/1b3n2/8/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I'm not sure if this was a good move but now i plan on trying to trap the bishop

442,18,12,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/1b3n2/8/2PB4/2N5/PP2BPPP/1R1QK1NR w K -',At this point i like to analyse the position of the board once a party has castled. I usually castle when i've got close to 100% mobility of my pieces. Right now i have a bishop at optimal point (although c5 would ruin it). My bishops are active and out. And all i need to do is mobilise my knight to Nf3
443,18,13,c5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1pqppp/1b3n2/2p5/2PB4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/1R1QK2R w K c6',As expected. But at the end of the day i have good control over the central squares. I opt for a trade

But it is an easily preventable attack with g3 stopping it effectively. So i proceed with attacking the king side.
445,18,15,d6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1b1p2q1/2pN4/2P5/5N2/PP2BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',This was the move that changed the game. i guess it was a silly mistake but i had to capitalise. This also gave me an opportunity to get Black to weaken his king side defence introduce a double pawn ensure that the gap in his king side is a white square (cos i've only got a white bishop) and take his queen.

451,18,21,Kh7,b'r2r4/pp4pk/1b2Q1N1/2p4p/2P5/3B4/PPb2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I had a few options here. Do the obvious discovered check with the white bishop but losing it to the bishop on c2. I decided to take the long way and remove the threat on my bishop on d3
452,18,22,Rde8,b'r3r3/pp4pk/1b2Q1N1/2p4p/2P5/8/PPB2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',On reflection i could've just sacrificed my queen and developed my Rf1 to e1. That way when he does take my queen with Re6 i could move my knight to f8 have the discovered check and be up in material by a rook and a knight. But i didnt because of the next few moves

Black chooses the continuation 8...h6 where as Finnish IM Tapani Sammaluvo puts it Black burns his boats behind him.  His king will never castle at least not on the kingside however his pieces can develop freely and White is unable to stop Black's freeing d5 break.  White's pieces develop quickly also and the play becomes razor sharp.

528,21,5,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This position is similar to the Symmetrical English where White plays an early d4 although White would have a pawn on c4.  In the English lines White doesnt waste time with a3 as the weak doubled pawns on c4 and c3 are compensated by control over d5 and d4.  Here the doubled pawns would be on c2 and b3 so I don't want to allow that.

Another reminder the best defense is a good offense.  Black needs to break with b5 or start preparing d5 for some much needed counterplay.

Nc6 blocking the check and protecting the Bishop. So to prevent that i have to attack the c6 square

It will take 2 moves which was risky cos the knight and rook can come into the action. However if the rook decides to come in with Re1 then i win the game.

If 71 K-h2 then if black tries to stay behind his pawn he will lose it.  eg 71 ... K-f4  72 K-h3 K-g3 (or g4) and black must move his King away and lose the pawn.  Whereas if 71 ... K-d3 72 K-g3 K-e2 then 73 and white's King must move away and he loses the pawn.  In this case the King that last approaches will win so we will probably end in a draw.
684,25,76,7Kf1,b'8/8/8/8/4k3/5p2/5P2/5K2 b - -',"?? Instead of advancing (and allowing a chance to win if Black makes a mistake) White has made a potentially fatal error!  If 71 ... K-d3 then Black can force white's King away and take the pawn and is in an ideal position to queen his own pawn and win the game.
At this point white offers the draw and black accepts after which White breathes a huge sign of relief!"

929,35,45,2Rd3,b'2k1r3/ppp1n1pp/8/4p3/1PP2pP1/P2R3P/2n2P2/5K1B b - -',A rook is not the best piece to use for defense.  It and the queen are best suited to offense (the rook from a distance).

931,35,47,2Be4,b'2kr4/ppp1n1pp/8/4p3/1PP1BpP1/P2R3P/2n2P2/5K2 b - -',White then has to commit another piece to a defensive role.  With fewer pieces remaining this will inevitably fail unless black makes a mistake.
932,35,48,2Rxd3,b'2k5/ppp1n1pp/8/4p3/1PP1BpP1/P2r3P/2n2P2/5K2 w - -',exchange the rooks which will leave the pawn on a3 undefended.
933,35,49,Nxa3,b'2k5/ppp1n1pp/8/4p3/1PP2pP1/n2B3P/5P2/5K2 w - -',and the pawn falls.
934,35,50,2c5,b'2k5/ppp1n1pp/8/2P1p3/1P3pP1/n2B3P/5P2/5K2 b - -',White is moving the pawn away from danger so his bishop is free to attack the pawn on h7 - a chance to take some initiative.  White may not have realised this yet though.
935,35,51,2a6,b'2k5/1pp1n1pp/p7/2P1p3/1P3pP1/n2B3P/5P2/5K2 w - -',? Black has missed the unprotected pawn and has started a pawn advance with the aim of promotion to a queen.
936,35,52,3c6,b'2k5/1pp1n1pp/p1P5/4p3/1P3pP1/n2B3P/5P2/5K2 b - -',?? White hasn't taken the pawn yet and has offered up his pawn for naught.  Black at this point realises he has the unprotected pawn.
937,35,53,3Nxc6,b'2k5/1pp3pp/p1n5/4p3/1P3pP1/n2B3P/5P2/5K2 w - -',! Black is happy to take with his Knight and also force the loss of the white's pawn on b4 in exchange for one pawn on h7 ending up another pawn up instead of a pawn down.
938,35,54,3Bf5+,b'2k5/1pp3p1/p7/4pB2/1n3pP1/n6P/5P2/5K2 b - -',White attempts to take the initiative with an easily evaded checking move.

941,35,57,3h4,b'3k4/2p3p1/p7/1p2p3/1n2BpPP/n7/5P2/5K2 b - -',white attempts his own pawn advance on the other side.  Perhaps his last chance.
942,35,58,3Nc4,b'3k4/2p3p1/p7/1p2p3/1nn1BpPP/8/5P2/5K2 w - -',Black spots the risk and commits a Knight to the cause.  Black is keeping his king free to help with pawn promotion confident that he can manage the g and h pawns with the knight.
943,35,59,3Ke2,b'3k4/2p3p1/p7/1p2p3/1nn1BpPP/8/4KP2/8 b - -',White starts to move his king into action given the reduced risk of mate now.  Pawn promotion has clearly become both sides goal.
944,35,60,3a5,b'3k4/2p3p1/8/pp2p3/1nn1BpPP/8/4KP2/8 w - -',Until white moves his pawns further black is pursuing promotion as far from the enemy king as possible.
945,35,61,3h5,b'3k4/2p3p1/8/pp2p2P/1nn1BpP1/8/4KP2/8 b - -',Here comes white's attempt.
946,35,62,3Nd6,b'3k4/2p3p1/3n4/pp2p2P/1n2BpP1/8/4KP2/8 w - -',and black's knight is moved into position to block.  This also threatens white's bishop.
947,35,63,3Bg2,b'3k4/2p3p1/3n4/pp2p2P/1n3pP1/8/4KPB1/8 b - -',If instead of the bishop fleeing 37 p-g5 then 37 .... Nxe4 38 p-h6  then 38 ... pxh6 39 pxh6 N-f6 still prevents the pawn promoting.  If 38 p-g6 then 38 ... K-e8 39 p-h6 pxh6 40 p-h7 K-f2 and black's pawn promotion fails again.
948,35,64,3g5,b'3k4/2p3p1/3n4/1p2p1PP/pn3p2/8/4KPB1/8 b - -',white now moves forward.
949,35,65,3Nf7,b'3k4/2p2np1/8/1p2p1PP/pn3p2/8/4KPB1/8 w - -',Black's Knight is moved into position for defense.
950,35,66,Nh6,b'3k4/2p3p1/6Pn/1p2p2P/pn3p2/8/4KPB1/8 w - -',Pawns are easily blocked and with white's bishop on white squares unless his king can attack the pawn on g7 he is powerless.
951,35,67,4f3,b'3k4/2p3p1/6Pn/1p2p2P/pn3p2/5P2/4K1B1/8 b - -',? White should have moved his King to attempt to prevent the pawn promotion.  If he can get his king into the square formed by a4 a1 d1 and d4 then he can stop the a4 pawn promotion (except for interference from black's knight and other pawn.  Alternatively B-h3 then to e6 may stop the advance temporarily.
952,35,68,4a3,b'3k4/2p3p1/6Pn/1p2p2P/1n3p2/p4P2/4K1B1/8 w - -',Promotion is now inevitable.

Bxf6.  My 2100 rated opponent enters into this line then let's off the accelerator with 5. e3 instead of the obvious 5. e4 with a central space advantage.  The position that results features a good example of play against an isolated d-pawn.

1017,38,11,1Nc3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pq1p/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White is ahead in development.  I need to get moving.
1018,38,12,1Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Too slow would have been the typical bishop fianchetto of the Torre systems.  Here the dark-squared bishop goes to an active diagonal and fights for the e5-square.
1019,38,13,1Bxc4,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Still behind in development and with an uncastled king I am now looking down the barrel of a d5-break.
1020,38,14,1Qf4,b'r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Utilizing a pin to stop the break at the same time keeping the f3-knight tied to the defense of h2.  An active defense is the best solution.
1021,38,15,1Rad1,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',If 13. d5 Ne5 14. Nxe5 Qxe5 15. g3 ed and Black is fine.
1022,38,16,1Rd8,b'r1br2k1/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Preventing d5 again via 14...Ne5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 threatening mate and hitting the queen and after 16. Qg3 Qxc4 Black is down a piece.
1023,38,17,1Rfe1,b'r1br2k1/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Anticipating an opening of the e-file.
1024,38,18,1Bd7,b'r2r2k1/pp1b1pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',The only real problem with the Black position is the light-sqared bishop.  Here I clear a space for the a8-rook but temporarily block any discovery tactics on the d-file from the d8-rook.  This was the major trade off.  In absence of any active plan White is going to get a space advantage on the queenside in addition to his advantage in the center and I would slowly suffocate.  Here I can at least develop my pieces and get some counterplay on the open files.
1025,38,19,Be7,b'2rr2k1/pp1bbpp1/2n1p2p/8/2BPNq2/P2Q1N2/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Better than ...Bb8 as the pressure against h2 is not as potent as White's queenside and center pressure.  Here I can swing the Bishop to f6 and to g7 after ...g6 if necessary.
1026,38,20,Rc7,b'3r2k1/pprbbpp1/2n1p2p/8/1PBPNq2/P2Q1N2/5PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',17...a6 is also a possiblity however I believe this move is stronger as it prepares to double on either file and 18. b5 Na5 gives Black control of the c-file.
1027,38,21,a6,b'3r2k1/1prbbpp1/p1n1p2p/8/1P1PNq2/P2Q1N2/B4PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',This is now necessary as ...Na5 doesn't come with tempo.
1028,38,22,1d5,b'3r2k1/1prbbpp1/p1n1p2p/3P4/1P2Nq2/P2Q1N2/B4PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',The attack commences.

1030,38,24,Rcd7,b'3r2k1/1p1rbpp1/p1n4p/3B4/1P3q2/P2Q1N2/5PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',White is probably slightly better if the situation isnt just equal.  Black has good play on the d-file the pawn structure is symmetrical and there is an opposite colored bishop situation.  White has succeded in liquidating his isolated pawn and his only weakness is on a3 which Black can't exploit.  On the other hand Black has a weakness on b7 and on g6 which is easier for White to exploit as he has the light-squared bishop.
1031,38,25,2Qb3,b'3r2k1/1p1rbpp1/p1n4p/3B4/1P3q2/PQ3N2/5PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',White breaks the pin and takes aim at f7.

1033,38,27,Nf5,b'3r1bk1/1p3pp1/p4q1p/5n2/1P6/PQ1B1N1P/5PP1/4R1K1 w - -',not aiming for d4 as after 28...Nxd4 Qxd4 29. Rd1 Black is in serious trouble.
1034,38,28,Nd6,b'3r1bk1/1p3pp1/p2n1q1p/8/1P6/P2B1N1P/2Q2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',The plan is to restrict the light-squared bishop and hopefully trade it off when Black would have some winning chances due to the bishop vs knight situation with pawns on both sides of the board.
1035,38,29,g6,b'3r1bk1/1p3p2/p2n1qpp/8/1P6/PQ1B1N1P/5PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Preparing to get the bishop to a more active diagonal.
1036,38,30,3Re5,b'3r2k1/1p3pb1/p2n1qpp/4R3/PP6/1Q1B1N1P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',This move took me by surprise as White increases his pressure and prevents any attempts at swapping queens.
1037,38,31,Re8,b'4r1k1/1p3pb1/p2n1qpp/2R5/PP6/1Q1B1N1P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',After the exchange the pawn on c5 would kick the knight to a less active square and White would be clearly better.
1038,38,32,3axb5,b'4r1k1/1pR2pb1/3n1qpp/1P6/8/1Q1B1N1P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',After 36. Bxb5 Nxb5 37. Qxb5 Qa1  38. Kh2 Be5  39. Qxe5 Rxe5 40. Rxb7 Re2 followed by ...Ra2 and the game is a theoretical draw.
1039,38,33,Ra1+,b'5bk1/1p1R1p2/3n1qpp/1P1Q4/8/3B1N1P/5PP1/r5K1 w - -',Faced with a defensive task the move that gives your pieces the most activity is most often the best move.  Here the rook can attack from behind in addition to keeping White pieces tied down as well.
1040,38,34,h5,b'5bk1/1p1R1p2/3n1qp1/1P1QN2p/8/7P/5PP1/1r3BK1 w - -',Keeping the knight out of g4.
