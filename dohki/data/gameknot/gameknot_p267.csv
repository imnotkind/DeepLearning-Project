1,0,1,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1nbpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP2QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',"exchange would maintain your structure it may not be that big deal but since you already played a6 having double pawns would waste its effort  exchange holds the same ""tempo"" since the move you develop will go to waste anyways on d6 (bd6). so instead 8...Nxe5 9.Bxe5 10...Bd6 might look better."
2,0,2,Qxd6,b'r3k2r/2p2ppp/p1pqpn2/3p4/3P4/2P1P3/PP2QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',The good side of this move is that your queen is better placed. tempo does not have such eminence anymore now that pieces are exchanged with pawn on D6 your able to get use of both pawns by attacking on C5 later on. Drawish game though.
3,0,3,h5,b'r3k2r/2p2pp1/p1pqpn2/3p3p/3P4/2P1P3/PP2QPPP/RN3RK1 w kq h6',Thats an interesting attempt to attack.something what I would do mayby objectively better would be 0-0 Ke7 or c5
4,0,4,g4,b'r3k2r/2p2p2/p1pqpn2/3p3p/2PP2p1/4P3/PP1NQPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Now it was your last chance for c5.
5,0,5,e5,b'r3k2r/2p1qp2/p1p2n2/2Ppp3/PP1P2pp/4P3/3NQPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',would be great if he would exchange this pawn but white handles this wisely by ignoring this.
6,0,6,1b5,b'r3k2r/2p1qp2/p1p2n2/1PPp4/P2Pp1pp/4P3/3NQPPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',Now it would be great time for  threatening kingside pawns H3 rather.
7,0,7,axb5,b'r3k2r/2pq1p2/2p2n2/1pPp4/P2Pp1pp/R3P3/3NQPPP/4R1K1 w kq -',Great move.
8,0,8,b4,b'r3k2r/2pq1p2/2p2n2/2Pp4/Pp1Pp1pp/R3P3/3NQPPP/R5K1 w kq -',this will eventually die since theres no protection just trade and then  Ke7.
9,0,9,Rh4,b'r3k3/2pq1p2/2p2n2/2Pp4/Pp1Pp2r/1R2P1pP/3NQ1P1/R5K1 w q -',I dont know what to recommend here so lets see what are you planning here. 
10,0,10,Ng4,b'r3k3/2pq1p2/2p5/2Pp4/PR1Pp1nr/4P1pP/3NQ1P1/R5K1 w q -',Okay this was totally unnecassary move. notice though that it would've been quite tricky had you had your Queen on E7 instead. 25.hxg4 25...Rh1!!  26.Kxh1 26...Qh4  27.Kg1 27...Qh2  28.Kf1 28...Qh1 mate.

In fact a rare case in point in the French and a great resemblance with many lines of the Sicilian because we have a race for mate with opposite castling. It surely explains why this line is popular among top attacking players like Shirov or Morozevich "
14,1,1,1h4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1n1ppp/p1n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P1P/2N1B3/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B1R b - h3',The oldest and most tried plan the Rook on h1 will be transferred on the third rank (Rh3) where it will be capable of defending laterally White queen-side castle while attacking Black's king-side. Others moves have been tried and notably two of them are less direct and more poisonous by defusing first Black's attack on the queen-side : 11.Qf2 (Kramnik) and 11.Nb3 (Nijboer Anand)
15,1,2,1Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2bpP3/3n1P1P/2N1B3/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B1R w - -',This exchange is forced if Black wants to push his b pawn as quickly as possible
16,1,3,1Na4,b'r1bq1rk1/3n1ppp/p3p3/2bpP3/Np1B1P1P/7R/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B2 b - -',Much more annoying for Black than the Knight retreat on e2 White will  consolidate greatly his castle by following by b3.
17,1,4,f6,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2pp/p3pp2/3pP3/Np1Q1P1P/7R/PPP3P1/2KR1B2 w - -',A move devised by Short vs. Kasparov. Usually a5 is played.
18,1,5,1Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2pp/p3pp2/3pP3/Np1Q1P1P/7R/PPP3P1/2K1RB2 b - -',A new move. Here Kasparov took Pawn b4 and Short Pawn e5 on the complicated position that ensued Kasparov crushed Short. Later it has been proven by GM Brynnel on many occasions that Short's move was perfectly playable and that white has to take the draw before getting into trouble.
19,1,6,1Qa5,b'r1b2rk1/3n2pp/p3pp2/q2pP3/Np1Q1P1P/7R/PPP3P1/2K1RB2 w - -',This move is an error it blocks my pieces on the queen-side as I will need a lot of time to develop my Bishop by Bb7-c6-b5. Much smarter were 16...a5 16...Qc7 keeping the tension or the safe and sensible 16...fxe5 17.fxe5 a5 with a very slight plus for Black as he will have better control of the position through the pawn target on e5. Note that the Queen is great on d8 as it is eyeing the weak h5 pawn as soon as White try to move the h3 Rook.

23,1,10,2Rg1,b'r4rk1/3n2pp/p3p3/qb1pPp2/1p1Q1P1P/1P1B3R/PNP3P1/1K4R1 b - -',Very good and essential move

25,1,12,2Nc5,b'2r2rk1/6pp/p3p3/qbnpPp2/1p1Q1P1P/1P5R/PNP3P1/1K3BR1 w - -',Now it is a question of time. The arrival of a Knight on e4 will spell an end to any Advantage for White in the Classical French. 
26,1,13,Ne4,b'2r2rk1/6pp/p3p3/qb1pPp2/1p1QnP1P/1P1B3R/PNP3P1/1K4R1 w - -',There it is...
27,1,14,2Bxe4,b'2r2rk1/6pp/p3p3/qb1pPp2/1p1QBP1P/1P5R/PNP3P1/1K4R1 b - -',The threat of 24...Nc3  helped this exchange bringing one passed pawn in the center.
28,1,15,2Qg5,b'2r2rk1/6pp/p3p3/qb1pP1Q1/1p2p1PP/1P5R/PNP5/1K4R1 b - -',White was in a difficult situation with a pawn less and no more concrete threats on my King. But here the Queen is going to far...
29,1,16,2Rxc2,b'5rk1/6pp/p3p3/qb1pP1Q1/1p2p1PP/1P5R/PNr5/1K4R1 w - -',I just saw that my Queen will take on a2 and then my Rook will check the King on c8 and that the White King will have to defend against a Queen a Rook a Bishop and 2 passed pawns. Also the Rooks are laying not protected on the back of White's camp.
30,1,17,2Qd2,b'5rk1/6pp/p3p3/1b1pP3/1p2p1PP/1P5R/qNKQ4/6R1 b - -',Perhaps not the best move but the position was not defensible.
31,1,18,2Rc8+,b'2r3k1/6pp/p3p3/1b1pP3/1p2p1PP/1P5R/qNKQ4/6R1 w - -',Threatening mate on the first rank so the returning of the material invested is forced.
32,1,19,bxc3,b'2r3k1/6pp/p3p3/1b1pP3/4p1PP/1Pp5/qNKQ4/6R1 w - -',Loses at least one more piece so White resigned. I was quite lucky to win this. Has my opponent followed up 21.Rg1! with 22.g4 I will have had all the trouble in this game. As the Sicilian the French is a strategical and sexy defence where one misstep can spell quickly the end for one of both sides.

34,2,1,Nxf7,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2Npp/p1p5/8/3qP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here Black takes me by surprise as he prefers to give up his N for a single p & perhaps a slightly exposed K. Better was 3.Nd3  
35,2,2,Kxf7,b'r1b2bnr/1pp2kpp/p1p5/8/3qP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',I think slightly better was to insert 6....Qxe4  & then follow it up with 7...Kxf7 picking the N. Anyway one always learns by experience...
36,2,3,Qxe4,b'r1b2b1r/1pp2kpp/p1p2n2/8/4q3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',white plays daringly; dropping his pieces & ps

38,2,5,Qe6,b'r1b2b1r/1pp2kpp/p1p1qn2/8/8/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Probably white accepted ...Be6?! giving scope for Qxb7

40,2,7,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3pp/p1p1qn2/2b5/5B2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This aims at blacks c7-p but Iam in no mood to drops this p & so plays

43,2,10,1Ne2,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2qpp/p1p5/2b4n/5B2/3P1QP1/PPP1NP1P/R4RK1 b - -',Anyway the position is beyond repair
44,2,11,g5,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2q1p/p1p5/2b3p1/5N2/3P1QP1/PPP2P1P/R4RK1 w - g6',The pin is horrible as either of his Q or N drops. With 2 piece down white decides to call off.

Many of you may (or may not) have noticed that Black's 6...Nf6 was a game-ending blunder. In fact the main line of the Matovinsky Gambit Accepted continues with 6...Bg7 to give the king an escape route.  Interestingly enough in the late 1950's white began to answer to 6...Bg7 with 7. Qf5!! an extremely powerful move that led to the disappearance of the Matovinsky Gambit."

179,10,9,1e5,b'r3nrk1/2qbbppp/p1npp3/4P3/1p3B2/1BN2NQ1/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',(!?) Now Black has to be careful.  15...bxc3?! 16. exd6 (forking Q and B) ...Bxd6 17. Bxd6 ...Nxd6 18. Qxd6 just looked too strong for White.  Black would then have to protect his Bd7 so after say ...Ra7 19. bxc3 is a (doubled) pawn up.
180,10,10,1Nxe5,b'r3nrk1/2qbbppp/p1n1p3/4N3/1p3B2/1BN3Q1/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White is threatening to take the Bd7 so Black must react.  My move (...Nxe5) is the likely cause of my troubles.  The 'machine' is recommending 16...Bd6.  If I considered this at all I suppose I rejected it on the grounds it seemed foolhardy to put another bishop as bait for the Rd1.  In fact after 16... Bd6 it's White's turn to make a choice. The Nc3 is en prise also the  Ne5.  17. Nxd7 ...Bxf4 18. Qf3 ... bxc3 19. Nxf8 ... Kxf8 leaves Black material up and in pretty good shape as White has to deal with the attack on h2.  So better is 17. Rxd6! ...Qxd6 18. Ne4 ...Qe7 19. Bg5! ...f6 20. Nxd7 ...Qxd7 21. Nc5 with compensation for the White giving up the exchange (the e6 pawn is dropping for a start) but plenty of play for Black too.  
181,10,11,Qb7,b'r3nrk1/1q1bbppp/p3p3/4B3/1p6/1BN3Q1/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',White's d-file pressure and dark square QB battery make it difficult for Black to avoid slipping into a passive position.

189,10,19,2bxa3,b'r3nrk1/5ppp/4pb2/pq2B3/4R3/pB2Q3/1PP2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Perhaps I misjudged this pawn exchange.  I felt that the c-pawn would be a potential target.  However in the ending that follows this passed pawn proves a constant distraction for Black.
190,10,20,Rxc5,b'4nrk1/5ppp/4pb2/p1r1B3/P3R3/1B6/2P2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',I confess I was fairly content at this moment (queen's off against a near 2000 rated player with no fundamental weaknesses in my position).
191,10,21,2Bf4,b'4nrk1/5ppp/4pb2/p1r5/P3RB2/1B6/2P2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',(!) But being a 2000 rated player he knows that the two bishops will be strong in the ending and takes the time to prevent the exchange of his dark squared Bishop (27.Bxf6 is obviously inferior after 27...Nxf6 -- when Black would be fine).  If White doesn't want to retreat his bishop the other plan is 27. f4 still maintaining a clear plus.

194,10,24,2Rc4,b'5rk1/5ppp/4pn2/p1r5/P1R2B2/1BbR4/2P2PPP/6K1 b - -',(!) White finds a clever way to negate the tempo gain just achieved by Black by attacking the bishop on c3 twice.
195,10,25,3c3,b'5rk1/5ppp/4pn2/p1r5/PbR2B2/1BPR4/5PPP/6K1 b - -',White insists on dislodging the dark square bishop from its pleasant home on b4.
196,10,26,3Rxc4,b'5rk1/5ppp/4pn2/p7/Pbr2B2/1BPR4/5PPP/6K1 w - -',Perhaps I could have tried 30 ...Ba3 instead but after 31. Rxc5 ...Bxc5 Black is still in significant difficulties: he can't oppose the White rook's control of the d-file nor activate his own on b8 (which would otherwise be good) since that square is covered by the Bf4.  The other advantage of Black exchanging on c4 is that after the bishop recaptures there is a White piece blocking his own passed pawn.
197,10,27,Bb6,b'5rk1/5ppp/1b2pn2/p7/P1B2B2/2PR4/5PPP/5K2 w - -',Aiming to exchange off rooks with ...Rd8. 
198,10,28,Bxd8,b'3b2k1/5ppp/4pn2/pB6/P4B2/2P5/5PPP/5K2 w - -',Although the rooks coming off the board arguably just accentuates White's two Bishop advantage it's hard to see what other plan Black should have tried - the rook was extremely passive on f8 and prevented any kind of king activity.
199,10,29,3c4,b'3b2k1/5ppp/4pn2/pB6/P1P2B2/8/5PPP/5K2 b - -',At last the pawn starts its advance.
200,10,30,3f3,b'6k1/5ppp/1b2pn2/pB6/P1P2B2/5P2/6PP/5K2 b - -',(!) Right up until this moment I was still feeling quite optimistic.  Following this move I began to realise how difficult it would be to get active.  For a start Black's knight has almost no good squares (Nh5 is the only knight move that doesn't lose material).  The second main problem is that if Black tries to get his king into the game with ...Kf8 he simply runs into Bd6  and because the e8 square is covered by the Bb5 he will have to return from whence he came.  I think that having seen this was the case I proceeded with a bogus alternative plan - rather than searching for a way to prevent this tactic.
201,10,31,3h6,b'6k1/5pp1/1b2pn1p/pB6/P1P2B2/5P2/6PP/5K2 w - -',The beginning of a convoluted plan to get the King out via g7.  However much better seems to be ...Bc5!  (Preventing White checking on d6 as mentioned in the earlier line) which should allow Black to get his King out.  The reason I didn't play this was because I feared 37. Bd2 attacking the now undefended a-pawn.  But perhaps in this case Black just returns his bishop to b6 and continues with ...Kf8 (since White's black square bishop is no longer eyeing d6).  If I had to choose one moment where the game was lost I'd go for not seeing...Bc5.  Now however White prevents that possibility.
202,10,32,Bd8,b'3b2k1/5pp1/3Bpn1p/pB6/P1P5/5P2/6PP/5K2 w - -',(Wanting to prevent 38. Be7 which would make the g-pawn advance impossible because of the hanging knight on f6.)
203,10,33,Ng8,b'3b2n1/5pk1/2BBp2p/p1P3p1/P7/5P2/4K1PP/8 w - -',What else?
204,10,34,Ne7,b'3b4/4npk1/2BBp2p/p1P3p1/P7/3K1P2/6PP/8 w - -',With an attack on the Bc6.  During this ending I was aware of two key strategic ideas: if Black can trade his knight for either the light or dark sq White Bishops his position will immediately improve.  Best of all would be knight for dark sq Bishop (leaving B's of opposite colour).  Hence this move hoping against hope that the attack on the undefended light-sq Bishop would provoke 42. Bxe7(?).  No such luck.
205,10,35,f5,b'3b4/1B2n1k1/3Bp2p/p1P2pp1/P7/3K1P2/6PP/8 w - f6',At last achieving a little breathing space but White is still firmly in control.
206,10,36,4Kd4,b'3b4/1B2n3/3Bpk1p/p1P2pp1/P2K4/5P2/6PP/8 b - -',Seeing that the obvious 44. Kb5 fails to make any progress (and also allows Black to gain more space with ...e5) the White king changes direction.  Over optimistically I took this as a sign that White might not have a clear winning plan.
207,10,37,4Kf7,b'3b4/1B2nk2/3Bp2p/p1P2pp1/P2K4/5P2/6PP/8 w - -',Trying to tempt White into the pseudo-active move 45 .Ke5(??).  Amazingly that horrible move would allow mate in two: 45...Nc6  46. Bxf6 (forced) ...Bf6  !  (who said endgames were boring?).
208,10,38,4Be5,b'3bk3/1B2n3/4p2p/p1P1Bpp1/P2K4/5P2/6PP/8 b - -',White doesn't want to push the c-pawn just yet as that would block the Bb7's cover of the d5 sq allowing Black a little activity with 46...Nd5
209,10,39,4Kd7,b'3b4/1B1kn3/4p2p/p1P1Bpp1/P2K4/5P2/6PP/8 w - -',Again after getting in ...Kd7 I was beginning to feel that I might be able to save the game.  Most of White's avenues into the Black position are or can be covered.
210,10,40,Nc6,b'3b4/1B1k4/2n1p2p/p1P1Bpp1/P1K5/5P2/6PP/8 w - -',(Attacking the Be5 and intending to meet 48. Kb5 with the annoying check ...Na7  when the white king has no choice but to retreat to c4).
211,10,41,Na7,b'3b4/nB1k4/4p2p/p1P2pp1/P1K5/2B2P2/6PP/8 w - -',(?) But this is a mistake.  I wanted to keep the White king out of b5 but 48...Kc7 would have been a lot better.  The attack on the Bb7 would have forced either Ba8 when the Bishop is less active or Ba6 when the pawn advance to c6 is no longer supported.  Further why put the knight on the edge of the board unnecessarily?
212,10,42,4g4,b'3b4/nB1k4/4p2p/p1P2pp1/P1K3P1/2B2P2/7P/8 b - g3',(!) Finding the right way.  This excellent move forces Black either to saddle himself with an isolated e-pawn (after an exchange on g4) or - as in the game - allow an exchange of pawns on f5 which removes the pawn cover on the d5 sq; enabling White's king to get in.
213,10,43,4Bc7,b'8/nBbk4/4p2p/p1P2pp1/P1K3P1/2B2P2/7P/8 w - -',Attacking the pawn on h2 even though actually capturing it gives White the a5 pawn in return and therefore two past queenside pawns.  Black should probably have played ...fxg4 (keeping control of d5) and hoped for the best.
214,10,44,5Kd5,b'8/nBbk4/7p/p1PK1pp1/P7/2B2P2/7P/8 b - -',Now White is getting ready to play c6.
215,10,45,5Bxh2,b'8/nB1k4/7p/p1PK1pp1/P7/2B2P2/7b/8 w - -',Black is strategically lost already - this merely accelerates matters.  He sould have tried 51...Ke7 instead but after 52. h3 White will soon be piling on the pressure since Black has hardly any useful moves.
216,10,46,5Bxa5,b'8/nB1k4/7p/B1PK1pp1/P7/5P2/7b/8 b - -',It's amazing to me that even though Black has managed to maintain material parity for 20 odd moves of the endgame his position is nevertheless now totally lost.
217,10,47,Nc8,b'2n5/1Bbk4/1B5p/2PK1pp1/P7/5P2/8/8 w - -',Totally boxed in a corner.  Capturing the Bb6 would not have changed matters: 53...Bxb6 54 cxb6 and now if ...Nc8 White just exchanges pieces moves his King to c6 and forces promotion and then mate.  Alternatively Black could try sacrificing his knight to mess up the white pawns with 53...Nb5 which looks interesting since the remaining bishop does not attack the queening square but in this case White can calmly mop up the kingside pawns because Black's King can't get near to b8 anyway (and any attempt to come round the back with ...Kc5 has white playing Bc8 and advancing the b6 pawn to promotion.)
218,10,48,5Bxc7+,b'2nk4/1BB5/2P4p/3K1pp1/P7/5P2/8/8 b - -',White finds the simplest way to victory.
219,10,49,5Bxc8,b'2B5/2k5/2P4p/3K1pp1/P7/5P2/8/8 b - -',Having avoided piece exchanges up until now suddenly it's just pawns.
220,10,50,5a5,b'2k5/8/2PK3p/P4p2/6p1/5P2/8/8 b - -',"The white pawns are too quick.  Black can play ...gxf3 and make a queen himself but one move later he'll be checkmated on the back rank by the new queen on a8.  Trying to slow White down with ...Kb8 doesn't help either: White plays Kd7 and queens the c-pawn instead.  Either way mate is only a few moves away so... Black resigns: 1-0

On the one hand I was pleased to have lasted so long against a much stronger opponent and not made any outright blunders.  Equally it's a shame to play so many moves and still end up with nothing...  Over and out -- Pikket"

407,15,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Stillgar plays my ideal response of c5.  A very aggressive move challenging the middle of the board.
408,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue my boring opening attacking the middle of the board.  
409,15,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Stillgar attacks right back continuing to be aggressive.  
410,15,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This is my way of being exciting while still doing my boring opening.  I keep saying my boring opening because I have not strayed from it for years.  I am challenging the middle of the board but really just offering trades and to keep the offensive.
411,15,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',In my mind by stillgar taking the d4 pawn he is excepting my trades.
412,15,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I take the pawn thinking he is going to take my knight then I will bring my queen out.
413,15,7,Qa5+,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/q7/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Instead stillgar continues to be aggressive bringing out his queen on the 4th move putting me in check.  In every book I have read(which is not many)  they all say not to bring the queen out to early.  In my experience this has been true because the queen gets bounced around while the other player brings more pieces out.  That in mind  I have not played too many high ranking players and stillgar probably sees something I don't.
414,15,8,Nc3,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/q7/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I try to not let this check and him bringing out his queen phase me and continue my boring opening.  
415,15,9,Nxd4,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q7/3nP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Stillgar continues to be very aggressive.  He decides to take the knight which is fine by me because I get to get out of my boring opening moves.
416,15,10,Qxd4,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q7/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I of course take the knight with my queen giving me the advantage for a brief moment.  I continue to play safe waiting till I get more pieces out till I attack.
417,15,11,e5,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/q3p3/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq e6',Although I am forced to move my queen I am still alright.  I have to big pieces out and am challenging the middle of the board.  I just have to be careful of the knight and make sure to pick a good spot for my queen.
418,15,12,Qd5,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/q2Qp3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I choose to make a move and be aggressive in order to keep the offensive on my side challenging his queen.  Also trading queens would hopefully help me not allowing stillgar to utilize such a crucial piece.  This would also free up my knight for the moment if he takes my queen.
419,15,13,Bb4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/q2Qp3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Stillgar is smart and no doubt sees what i am doing so takes the offensive back by threatening my knight while protecting his queen and now challenging my queen.  This doesn't allow me to sit and wait for him to take my queen advancing my pawn.
420,15,14,Qxa5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/Q3p3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I decide then to trade queens because this will keep me on the offensive for the moment.
421,15,15,Bxa5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/b3p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',At this point we are developed equally so I decide to continue to develop.

423,15,17,Bxc3+,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This move I expected because stillgar has been aggressive the whole game.  Although I don't like doubling up my pawns I do like it's rewards.

426,15,20,1f3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',My only move is to protect that pawn.

428,15,22,1Bg5,b'r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3K2R b KQ -',I decide to make an aggressive move for better or worse.

On my notes at this point I tell my self that I am still in this game and to think 5 moves in advance.  To watch out for the doubled pawns and the open b file.  I also put in my notes to be aware of his rooks and bishop.  I do this because it's 17 moves in the game and I feel that I am still in this game and want to stay alert even if that means writing down silly notes.  When looking at the whole board I do see that he has a much better set up with his king very well protected.

At this point in the game I feel I have better position and so getting rid of those pieces would help.

481,15,75,3bxc4,b'4k3/1b4p1/5p1p/B4P1P/2pKp1P1/8/2P5/8 w - -',Stillgar takes the pawn.
482,15,76,3Kxc4,b'4k3/1b4p1/5p1p/B4P1P/2K1p1P1/8/2P5/8 b - -',I take his pawn with my king leaving his pawn free on the e file.  I am alright with that because I have my bishop protecting the e1 spot.  Now I can concentrate on bringing my pawn up on the c file or attacking on the other side of the board.  I must be careful because all my pawns are on white squares so they are at risk with stillgar's bishop.
483,15,77,3e3,b'4k3/1b4p1/5p1p/B4P1P/2K3P1/4p3/2P5/8 w - -',He brings up his pawn threatening an upgrade.

This game was equal but after these moves black gained advantage. 22...Rdg8 23.Re2 Rh4 would have keeped this game equal as 22...h6? should be followed by 23.h3 Rg3 24.Ba5 Be3  25.Rxe3 Rxe3 26.Bxd8 Kxd8 27.Rxf5 and white has clear advantage and should win this game by accurate endgame.
509,16,15,2Rdg8,b'2k3r1/1p3R2/p6p/2p2p2/P4br1/1PB5/2P3PP/5RK1 w - -',Now black punsihes me right away as I didnt saw what I sould have played.

513,17,1,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',3. Nxe5 - I decide to play Damiano's Gambit.  It is quite sound because if fe?? then I will play 4. Qh5  which will lead to mate or ruinous loss of material for black.  Just play out the database and you will see!!
514,17,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5pp1/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3. ......... g6?  An unusual way to decline the gambit.  It just loses a pawn.  Best is 3. ......... Qe7 which is the Macgregor-Chigorin Variation which regains the pawn but leads to retarded development.

The black queen is tempted by the hanging pawn on b4 but she is playing right into my hands because she can be easily driven back by 18. Rb1 which is just where I wanted to place my king rook!  More importantly it opens up the b file.

I am very pleased with this mating attack as I am normally a very passive player.  I really do need to develop this aspect of chess as I do tend to make heavy weather of converting material or positional advantages.
526,18,0,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',2. Qh5 (the so-called Patzer's Opening).  If 2....... g6?? then black loses a rook to 3. Qxe5  so black must either defend the e pawn by 2. ........ Nc6 or 2..... d6.  The former is preferable as it develops a piece.
527,18,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',3. Bc4 - transposes into the Bishop's Opening and threatens Old Scollie's Mate - a pet name of mine for Scholar's Mate.  Black can play either Qe7 or Qf6 or g6.  I choose g6 because I feel this is the smoothest way of developing my pieces.

In hindsight it would have been better to have put my bishop back on e6 and then perhaps d7 to prepare a Re8-e6 manoeuvre to drive out enemy rook that was about to camp on f6 and then try to exchange off the backward pawn on d6 - but silly silly me has to do it all in the wrong order doesn't she?  When you do things in the wrong order you may find you never get the chance to execute your plan effectively!!

I should have played Re8 - d6 (although perhaps my opponent may well have doubled on the e file - if so then it would have been a good idea to move the d8 rook to d7 to back up the f pawn) then try to exchange off the backward pawn.  Now folks here comes a lost endgame!!
534,18,8,2Rb6,b'3r1rk1/1p3p1p/1R4p1/Pp1p4/6P1/3P4/1PP4P/R5K1 b - -',22. Rb6 (vicious fork!!)

543,19,4,c3,b'rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpp2/8/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This move protects my d5 pawn while allowing me to coordinate my queen and my bishop by moving to c2.  With my black squared bishop developed I don't need the c3 square open for it.
544,19,5,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pp2q1pp/2pbpp2/8/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',My chess engine likes Qc2 or Bd3 better I assume because there is no urgency in castling at the moment and that a queen developing move like Qc2 gives me the added flexibility of castling on either side.  Still it makes me nervous to have my king on a half-open file when a queen is on the other side of it.
545,19,6,1Bd7,b'rn2k2r/pp1bq1pp/2pbpp2/8/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',This move seems to actually hinder black's development since the white square bishop doesn't gain much in the way of development and severely limits the mobility of both the queen and the knight.
546,19,7,1Re1,b'rn2k2r/pp1bq1pp/2pbpp2/8/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Developing my queen probably should have been a priority but I blame Nimzovich (I've seen this spelled 4 different ways and I'm not sure this is one of them) for stressing over and over how important it is to put rooks on open or half open files.  In this case we have the added bonus that the rook is in front of black's queen.
547,19,8,1e5,b'rn2k2r/pp1bq1pp/2pb1p2/4p3/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',This contains all sorts of traps for black.  Fritz says I should take with my d pawn and eventually move my knight and play Qh5 .  However after 12. Bd3 I was hoping for 12.... exd4 13.Bxd4 and the queen would be directly pinned to the king.  One can hope right?
548,19,9,O-O,b'rn3rk1/pp1bq1pp/2pb1p2/4p3/3P4/2PBBN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Removing the threat of the pin on the king but exposing white's king along the long white diagonal. 12...Bg4 (pinning white's knight) or ...Be6 (activating the bishop and preventing the queen pin or an eventual Bc4 ) might have been better but since Bg4 was played the next move 12...0-0 is fine.
549,19,10,1Bd2,b'rn3rk1/pp1bq1pp/2pb1p2/4p3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Unleashing the rook along the e file like nimzovich told me.  However the right way to unleash the fury would have been 13.Bf4 putting more pressure on the (pinned) e pawn.  The chess engine likes 13.dxe5 as well.
550,19,11,g6,b'rn3rk1/pp2q2p/2pb1pp1/4p3/3P2b1/2PB1N2/PPQB1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black is in some serious trouble here.  Moving his pawn to g6 will allow me to sacrifice my white bishop for both of his kingside pawns making his king very uncomfortable after Bxg6...hxg6 Qxg6 .  In black's defense the chess engine thinks 14...g6 is as good a move as any.

554,19,15,Rg8,b'rn4rk/pp2q3/2pb1p1B/4p3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',It probably would have been better to develop the knight to d7 allowing the rooks to be linked up (and as an added bonus getting the knight closer to the crisis).  For my part the chess engine likes Qh4 or Qh3 much better than Qh5 I guess because Qh4 puts more pressure on the f pawn.  I still like putting pressure on the e pawn myself.
555,19,16,Nd7,b'r5rk/pp1nq3/2pb1p1B/4p2Q/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I like linking up the rooks.

Unfortunately I couldn't grab the queen with this but after exchanging queens I got a bishop for free.  I wish I could have kept up the attack a little longer but I was pretty much out of ammo.
557,19,18,2Rxg7+,b'r7/pp1n2Rk/2pB1p2/8/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',I was a bit ahead so why not trade off?  There was always the possibility of trying again with R(a1)-e1-e7.
558,19,19,2Nxd4,b'r7/pp1n2k1/2pB1p2/8/3N4/2P5/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Taking with the knight instead of the pawn preserves my pawn structure.  Black's pawn at f3 is protected by a king and knight and is a major liability.
559,19,20,2Kf1,b'4r3/pp1n2k1/2pB1p2/8/3N4/2P5/PP3PPP/R4K2 b - -',Moving the g4 pawn would have also been appropriate.  I guess we can now say we're in the endgame since most of the threats will come to or from pawns.  I'm up a bishop and two kingside pawns- victory I thought was assured.  Credit my uneven playing and my opponents excellent tactical play particularly with the knight to turning this into a drawn game.
560,19,21,2Nf5+,b'4r3/pp1n2k1/3B1p2/2p2N2/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R4K2 b - -',A bit petty but as good a spot for the knight as any.  The knight could have been stronger after moving my pawn to g4.
561,19,22,2Ng3,b'4r3/pp1n1k2/3B1p2/2p5/8/2P3N1/PP3PPP/R4K2 b - -',No idea what I was thinking here.  There's nothing wrong with the knight outpost I had and scooting the h pawn up the board (or trading off rooks) should have been my top priority.
562,19,23,3Bc7,b'8/p1Bn4/1p2kp2/2p5/8/2P3N1/PP3PPP/4K3 b - -',And here's where I get greedy.
563,19,24,Ng6,b'8/p1B5/1p2k1n1/2p2p2/5P1P/2P3N1/PP4P1/4K3 w - -',My pawns are forked but losing the f pawn is quite acceptable if I can sneak my h pawn further down the board.
564,19,25,3Bb8,b'1B6/p3n3/1p3k1P/2p2p2/5P2/2P3N1/PP4P1/4K3 b - -',Bd8 was the better move here pinning the knight and forcing black to choose between letting my pawn promote or giving up the knight for free.  My greed for pawns on this move and the next led me to an inexcusable blunder.
565,19,26,3h7,b'2n5/B6P/pp3k2/2p2p2/5P2/2P3N1/PP4P1/4K3 b - -',Kxf5 was the correct move here- if black takes back I have a free ride to pawn promotion; if not the knight makes it hard for the king to prevent the promotion.
566,19,27,3Bxb6,b'2n5/6kP/pB6/2p2p2/5P2/2P3N1/PP4P1/4K3 b - -',I could have saved my bishop here or grabbed a pawn with the knight and force black's knight to capture the bishop on the edge of the board.
567,19,28,4g4,b'8/7k/pn6/2p2N2/5PP1/2P5/PP6/4K3 b - g3',Didn't do me much good.  Should have probably moved the knight to e3 or d6 getting it involved in the queenside struggle while leaving my f pawn free to roam.
568,19,29,4Nd5,b'8/7k/p7/2pn1N2/5PP1/2P5/PP6/4K3 w - -',See what I mean?  A pawn given up with no compensation.
569,19,30,4b3,b'8/7k/p7/2p2N2/6P1/1PPn1K2/P7/8 b - -',Now I'm on the defensive and poised to be picked apart by some precise play.
570,19,31,5g6,b'8/6k1/p5P1/Pn2NK2/8/8/8/8 b - -',According the to engine this (and move 57) is where I entirely lost my advantage.  It suggests Nc6 Kg4 Nc4 Ke4 or Nd3... pretty much any move but the one I made.
571,19,32,Nxg6,b'8/6k1/6n1/2N3K1/8/8/8/8 w - -',And the game is drawn (for whatever reason we exchanged draw offers a few times before we officially drew).  Overall uneven play in the midgame and great play in the endgame by my opponent and sloppy play in the endgame and fine play in the midgame by myself.  The moral of the story?  Spend more calculation time in the endgame positions particularly since this is correspondence chess and I had days to make my moves.  Working some endgame puzzles probably wouldn't hurt either.

I contemplated bishop to f5 knowing he wouldn't do it or else lose the queen. queen and bishop isn't always a good trade for a queen but I was willing here. Instead I found a better move moving the knight in.

Takeaways from this annotation: 
1. ""The pin is mightier than the sword.""  
2. Check must be answered no matter what the cost.  It's one of the most powerful moves in chess and you should ALWAYS look for ways to put your opponent in check!  Remember since your opponent MUST answer to check you get a FREE MOVE no matter how bad your position is!
3. Even when you are down -5 don't resign unless your position is hopeless!  We are all prone to mistakes and unless you know your opponent VERY well don't resign too early.

I welcome your comments and I hope this was helpful.

729,24,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Steinitz began with his favored King's Pawn Opening.
730,24,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Bird responded with e6 a move that gains momentum in preparation for a d5 advance in the next move.
731,24,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Steinitz quickly grabs space (the c5 and e5 squares) before defend e4 after Bird's likely 2...d5 advance.
732,24,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Bird completes the formation of the French Defence striking at whites pawn center.  The French Defence (as seen here) is the third most popular response to the King's Pawn Opening.
733,24,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Steinitz responded with the popular Rubinstein Variation.  This move begins rapid queen-side development pressures the center and defends e4.
734,24,5,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Bird decides to exchange pawns.  This is a weak but common move among beginners since it allows whites knight to make a nice home on e4.
735,24,6,Nxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Steinitz of course reclaims his pawn.
736,24,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Bird immediately challenges White's knight.  Although it looks like a fine move at first glance Stienitz will treat it as a mistake.
737,24,8,Nxf6+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pN2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',By capturing the knight Bird is forced to either double his pawns or expose his queen.  Now Bird is realizing the subtle consequences of 4...Nf6 a move that he not surprisingly never played again in his career.
738,24,9,Qxf6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pq2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Bird recaptures with his queen apparently deciding against doubled pawns.
739,24,10,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pq2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Steinitz calmly reinforces d4 and e5 but also plans to play 7. Bg5 forcing Bird's queen into the center of the board.
740,24,11,Nc6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pq2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! - This was probably Bird's first notable mistake.  Much better was 6...h6 or even 6...Qd8 safeguarding his queen from 7. Bg5.
741,24,12,Bg5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pq2/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Steinitz played the obvious move.  Bird's queen is forced to waste another non-developing move while Steinitz activates yet another piece.
742,24,13,Qf5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/5qB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Bird decides to place his queen on f5.  7...Qg6 is also decent (answering 8. Bd3 with 8...Qh5).
743,24,14,Bd3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/5qB1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Steinitz develops yet another piece towards Bird's queen temporarily preventing him from developing.

745,24,16,h3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/6B1/3P2q1/3B1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',!! - Steinitz forces the queen to move again - but this time sacrificing a pawn.

747,24,18,1Rh2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/6B1/3P4/3B1N1P/PPP2PqR/R2QK3 b Qkq -',! - Another great move by Steinitz now Bird's queen is finally trapped!

749,24,20,1Nxh2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/6B1/3P4/3B3P/PPP2P1N/R2QK3 b Qkq -',Steinitz happily gobbles the queen and firmly stands three points ahead.
750,24,21,1Nxd4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/6B1/3n4/3B3P/PPP2P1N/R2QK3 w Qkq -',?? - In his frustration Bird blunders once again!
751,24,22,1Bb5+,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/1B4B1/3n4/7P/PPP2P1N/R2QK3 b Qkq -',! - Steinitz makes a beautiful discovered attack on Bird's knight.  Now 12...Bd7 13. Bxd7  Kxd7 14. Qxd4  wins another piece for white!  Even worse is 12...Nxb5?? 13. Qd8# and 12...Nc6?? 13. Bxc6  where white can't avoid mate.  At this point Bird furiously resigns.  Although this game is a poor representation of Bird's true skill it demonstrates Steinitz's calm and collected approach that won him the title of World Chess Champion.  In Henry Bird's defence he received immortalization when 1. f4 was named the Bird's Opening in his memory.

838,27,26,2Qb2,b'R4bk1/5pp1/7p/3p4/2rP4/2P1Bq2/1Q3P1P/6K1 b - -',(??) A crucial mistake.  Because I had missed Black's 26th move I did not consider the importance of keeping my queen covering the d1 square.  I thought it was enough to be threatening either ...Qb8 or ...Qa3 next move.  Qb3 would have allowed both of these moves but also kept an eye on d1 (and thereby prevented Black's winning counter-attack).
839,27,27,2Rc6,b'R4bk1/5pp1/2r4p/3p4/3P4/2P1Bq2/1Q3P1P/6K1 w - -',(!) Ouch! Black is going to checkmate White long before he can capture the Bishop on f8 (the threat is on say 27. Qa3 just ...Rg6  28. Bg5 ...Rxg5 29. Kf1 and ...Qd1  ).  Now it can be seen that if White's queen was on b3 this combination would not be possible.  27. Qb8 is a little better allowing the Queen to backtrack to g3 to block the rook's check from g6 but the loss of his queen would still be fatal in the long run.  The best bet would have been just to accept the earlier mistake and play 27.Qb3 now.  However without an attack on Black's king White is just a lot worse.  Nothing is given by the sacrifice: 27. Rxf8  after ...Kf8  28.Qb8  ..Ke7 29. Qb7 .. Kd6 there is no perpetual.  Going from bad to worse I conceived of a plan involving the sacrifice of my Bishop to block the g-file:
840,27,28,2h4,b'R4bk1/5pp1/2r4p/3p4/3P3P/2P1Bq2/1Q3P2/6K1 b - h3',Intending to meet ...Rg6  with 28. Bg5 and hoping for 28...hxg5  29. h5 ... (rook moves) and then 30. Qb8 winning the f8 bishop at last with some drawing chances.
841,27,29,2h5,b'R4bk1/5pp1/6r1/3p2pP/3P4/2P2q2/1Q3P2/6K1 b - -',So far so good... Now if I can juuuuust get Qb8 in...

Now of course 30 Qb8 is met with ...Re1  and mate next move with ...Rh1   .  So faced with huge loss of material after something like 30. Qa1 ...Re2  31. Qf1 ..Re4 (threat Rg4 ) 32. Qg2 ..Re1  33. Kh2 .. Qxh5  34.Qh3 .. Rh1! (netting the queen) White resigns.

The most common are Nf3 Bd3 Be2 or h3 all offering standard development. Other interesting possibilities are f3 and Bg5. I think this would a perfect set position for a Mini-Tournament leaving White to choose his 6th move. I went for f4 an aggressive line against the King's Indian Defence.

1007,37,17,b4,b'5rkn/5p2/2b1p3/3pP2P/1ppP1p2/5P2/6PK/8 w - -',In my opinion White should have played a4 to prevent b5. As a rule if black plays a6 then white usually must play a4 in order to prevent black from creating a strong attack on the queenside. Plus White did a poor job of developing his pieces to squares that maximize their potently. In conclusion this is an instructive game that show you what happens when black is allowed to play b5 unchallenged.

By not exchanging the Knight f6 on the 9th move White has entered the so-called ""positional line"".
It means generally less risk and a more logical game ahead.
By conceding the Bishop pair and a certain amount of counter-play on the king-side White is hoping to make his white square domination tell in the center and on the queen-side."

1012,38,4,1O-O,b'1r1q2k1/6pp/2np4/1p1Nprb1/8/2P5/1PN2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Unless Black manages to create some nice threats on the king-side White will enjoy good positional advantage due to the white squares weaknesses c6-d5-e6 and b5 and d6 weak pawns.
1013,38,5,1g6,b'1r1q2k1/7p/2np2p1/1p1Nprb1/8/2P5/1PN2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Somewhat passive and loses the d6 pawn or worse better was to push the e pawn to create some dynamics in the position : 18...e4 19.Nce3 Re5

I like the Stonewall because you can follow your script pretty much disregarding what black is doing and also because I've got a decent grasp on what I'm supposed to do during the midgame.  However this game shows how cramped white's queenside pieces can be with the Stonewall."

I'm in good position particularly in the center but I don't know what to do with black's soon-to-be fianchetto'ed position.  My usual plans call for a subsequent Bd3 and then sacrificing the bishop at h7 but since that's out of the question I should have worked to further control the center and to develop my queen's knight.

1025,39,7,Ne4,b'r4rk1/ppq1ppbp/6p1/1BPpPb2/4n3/N1P1P3/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black wisely declined to take the e5 pawn with his queen (it wasn't going anywhere) and got his knight in a strong position while freeing his bishop to take the e5 pawn and link up with the queen on the long diagonal.

Moving to g2 puts the g pawn under attack by the knight the bishop and the queen.  I figured I would just put some pressure on black's f7 on the outside chance of 13....R(f8)d8?.

I should have kept the center locked up and secured for myself instead of trying to develop everyone to go on the attack at once.
