0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game is one I played on a site similar to GameKnot.  It was in the second to last round of a tournament and I needed to win or draw in order to avoid elimination.
1,0,1,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',The game solidifies into the Wing Attack which slightly favors white if played accurately
2,0,2,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Mostly waiting for black to commit while restricting black's potential for king side expansion

6,0,6,1Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/1bp1bppp/p1n2n2/1p2N3/3Pp3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - -',This instead of 11. dxe5 to hopefully win the over-extended pawn on e4
7,0,7,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/p1bb1n2/1p4B1/3Pp3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/RN1QR1K1 b - -',Pinning one of the defenders of that e4 pawn
8,0,8,1h6,b'r2q1rk1/2p2pp1/p1bb1n1p/1p4B1/3Pp3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/RN1QR1K1 w - -',Forcing white to either retreat or exchange and leave black with the bishop pair.  I decided to exchange to avoid losing the initiative
9,0,9,1d5,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p1bb1q1p/1p1P4/4p3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/RN1QR1K1 b - -',Forcing away the last defender of the e pawn.  In retrospect this move obstructs the white bishop and allows black's white bishop to remain active on d7 so all the focus on winning the e pawn was probably misplaced
10,0,10,Bc5,b'r4rk1/2pb1pp1/p4q1p/1pbP4/4R3/1BP4P/PP3PP1/RN1Q2K1 w - -',Black has some serious attacking chances here but I was pretty sure I could defend this position.
11,0,11,Rae8,b'4rrk1/2pb1pp1/p4q1p/1pbP4/4R3/1BP4P/PP2QPP1/RN4K1 w - -',"? I think Qg6 would have been better here as this allows white to bring its knight into the fight.
I think the variation 17. ...Qg6 18. Qf3 Bf5 19. Re1 Rae8 is better"
12,0,12,Rxe4,b'5rk1/2pb1pp1/p5qp/1pbP4/4r3/1BP2Q1P/PP1N1PP1/R5K1 w - -',?? Once again I think black would have been better served to force the issue with Bf5 as this allows the white knight to become even more active while gaining a tempo on the black bishop
13,0,13,2d6,b'4r1k1/2pb1pp1/pb1P2qp/1p6/4N3/1BP2Q1P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',?? The knight on e4 is left to the mercy of black's rook
14,0,14,2c5,b'4r1k1/3b1pp1/pb1P2qp/1pp5/4N3/1BP2Q1P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - c6',?? Declining the knight?  Blocking the white bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal is not necessary as 22. ...Rxe4 23. Bxf7  Qxf7 Qxe4 leaves black with a winning advantage
15,0,15,2Bc2,b'4r1k1/3b1pp1/pb1P2qp/1pp5/4N3/2P2Q1P/PPB2PP1/3R2K1 b - -',Defending the knight before it is too late
16,0,16,2Qe6,b'4r1k1/3b1pp1/pb1Pq2p/1pp5/4N3/2P2Q1P/PPB2PP1/3R2K1 w - -',Getting the queen away from the bishop's discovered attack.
17,0,17,c4,b'4r1k1/3b1pp1/pb1Pq2p/1p6/2p1N3/2PQ3P/PPB2PP1/3R2K1 w - -',This appears to be a good move as it opens up the black bishop with a tempo on the queen but...
18,0,18,2Nf6+,b'4r1k1/3b1pp1/pb1PqN1p/1p6/2p5/2PQ3P/PPB2PP1/3R2K1 b - -',! A devastating invasion by the knight.  Black resigned here.
19,1,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. .......... Nf6 - the more modern way of meeting the Scandinavian Defense or Centre Counter opening characterised by 1.e4 d5. 2. exd5.
20,1,1,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ............ Nxd5 - black regains his pawn after the standard d4 response to 2........ Nf6.
21,1,2,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',5. ......... Bf5 - white builds up a centre with c4 and d4 and develops a knight to c3.  The king knight is driven back to f6 and now black develops his bishop to f5 which is a strong deployment for this piece.
22,1,3,1Bf4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/5b2/2PP1B2/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',10. Bf4 - over the last few moves we continue to develop our pieces.
23,1,4,axb5,b'r2qk2r/3nbp2/2p1pn1p/1p3bp1/3P4/2N2N1P/PP2BPPB/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',14. ........... axb5 - this move leaves me with an IQP - fortunately this does not cost me the game!
24,1,5,2Bxe5,b'3rk2r/4bp2/1qp4p/1p1pBbp1/3P4/P4B1P/1P3PP1/2RQ1RK1 b k -',20. Bxe5 - I was unable to keep my knight on e5 and a lot of wood has been cleared from the board over the last few moves.

27,1,8,Bxb4,b'3r2k1/3r4/5p1p/3p2p1/1b2b3/7P/1P2BPPB/2R2RK1 w - -',30. ........ Bxb4 - the queens are now exchanged.  Black's position is preferable because he has superior mobility.  Both of us have passed isolanis but black's is more advanced.  But incredibly later on that vulnerable looking b pawn will spell checkmate for the black king later on albeit in another form!!
28,1,9,fxe4,b'3r2k1/3r4/7p/6p1/1b1pp3/7P/1P3PPB/2RR2K1 w - -',33. ..... fxe4 - one pair of bishops are now swapped off.  The black pawns are connected so my king must start to centralise himself which he does with 34. Kf1.
29,1,10,Rxd7,b'6k1/3r4/7p/6p1/1b6/4p2P/1P4PB/2R2K2 w - -',36. ........... Rxd7 - but black exchanges one pair of pawns - his e pawn is passed but is an isolani and I must fix that pawn on a dark square so it is vulnerable to king and bishop attack later on.  This plan succeeds.
30,1,11,3Bxc7,b'8/2B2k2/7p/6p1/1b6/4p2P/1P4P1/5K2 b - -',39. Bxc7 - now the rooks have been swapped off.  Black continues to centralise his king.
31,1,12,4b4,b'8/8/1B2k2p/6p1/1P6/4p2P/4K1P1/2b5 b - b3',42. b4 - the e pawn is doubly attacked and once defended.  The black king cannot protect it in time.  My b pawn advances out of range of the black lsb and towards b8.
32,1,13,4Bxe3,b'8/8/3bk2p/1P4p1/8/4B2P/4K1P1/8 b - -',44. Bxe3 - the bishop is finally able to gobble up that passer.  I now have a one pawn advantage but can I convert it.  If I do then although this is an unrated game this will be my biggest triumph on gameknot.  Just look at those ratings!!
33,1,14,4hxg4,b'1b6/8/8/1P1k2p1/3B2P1/3K4/8/8 b - -',48. hxg4 - the h pawns disappear from the board.
34,1,15,5b6,b'1b6/8/1P3k2/6p1/6P1/3KB3/8/8 b - -',50. b6 - that pawn edges ever closer to b8.
35,1,16,5Kc6,b'8/8/1PK2k2/6p1/6P1/4B1b1/8/8 b - -',53. Kc6 - the black king is cut off from the b pawn.  I can draw this game with one fell stroke by taking on g5 with the dsb but I scent victory!!!
36,1,17,5Kd7,b'1b6/1P1K4/5k2/6p1/6P1/4B3/8/8 b - -',55. Kd7 - cuts off the black king still further and prepares to shepherd the b pawn to the b8 square.  The black dsb must be driven away from b8!
37,1,18,5Bxg5,b'1b6/1P1K4/8/4k1B1/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',56. Bxg5 - now black cannot win.
38,1,19,5Bd8,b'2KB4/1P6/8/4b3/4k1P1/8/8/8 b - -',58. Bd8!! - the killer.  That bishop cannot be prevented from going to c7.  The bishop will either be driven off the h2 - b8 diagonal or exchanged.  Although black plays Kf4 with a view to taking the white g pawn I will be left with sufficient material - a WQ to force checkmate.  I do play Bc7 on the next move and black waves the white flag giving me my first victory on gameknot over 1750  oppo.  Ten years ago I did beat an 1800s  player OTB but this has only ever happened to me once so yes this is a triumph in more ways than one because my opponent was a joint winner along with Pukism in the GK38 tournament.  Zamzaweck beat me 2-0 and this was during my Big Slump!  I just hope there will be more triumphs like this to come.

40,2,0,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. f3 - a d pawn opening with fairly standard moves - f3 is playable here.  White will play the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit here.  Unfortunately for my opponent I manage to hold onto the gambit pawn and it leads to my successful endgame - but before this happens I have much work to do!!
41,2,1,Qe2,b'r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/1B4B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',8. Qe2 - over the last few moves black has tried to catch up in development by breaking white's pin on b5 by playing the lsb to d7.  I prepared Be7 by playing e6.  The king knight is temporarily pinned but this does not last.  White clears the way for castling on both sides with 8. Qe2.
42,2,2,1Qe3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2b1pb2/8/3P4/2N1QN2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',11. Qe3 - backs up his d pawn and stops me from isolating his kingside pawns.  I exchange pieces anyway.
43,2,3,Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2p1pb2/8/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w kq -',13. ............... Qc7 - after white castles queenside I now clear wood off the back rank and this queen move bolsters b7 and c6.
44,2,4,Be7,b'r3k2r/ppq1bppp/2p1p3/8/3PN3/5Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w kq -',14......... Be7 - bishop must retreat as he is doubly attacked by the Wkt and WQ.
45,2,5,O-O,b'r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2p1p3/8/3PN3/5QP1/PPP4P/2KR3R w - -',15.......... 0-0 completes development.  White starts a pawn storm on the kingside but this is soon nipped in the bud.
46,2,6,g6,b'r4rk1/ppq4p/2p1p1p1/5pP1/3P4/5QP1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',18. ........ g6 - I remove white's dangerous knight and the resulting exchanges leave white with doubleton isolanis on the kingside to go with his pawn minus.
47,2,7,2gxf4,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2p1p1p1/5pP1/3P1P2/8/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',20. gxf4 - white straightens out the kingside pawns but the queens have been exchanged and I maintain my pawn advantage into the double rook ending.
48,2,8,Kg7,b'3r1r2/pp4kp/2p1p1p1/5pP1/P2P1P2/8/1PP5/2KR3R w - -',21. Kg7 - with my last two moves I accomplish 2 things - contest the half-open d file and clear a flexible defensive line for my rooks where the h pawn is concerned.  This strategy will lead to a pair of rooks being exchanged.
49,2,9,2b4,b'4r2r/pp4kp/2p1p1p1/5pP1/PPPP1P2/8/8/2K1R2R b - b3',24.  Over the last few moves The Carpenter has erected an impressive wall of pawns on the queenside.  Will he get himself a passer?  He tries to!!
50,2,10,Kg7,b'4r3/pp4k1/2p1p1p1/1P3pP1/P1PP4/8/8/2K1R3 w - -',27. ........ Kg7.  A pair of rooks and a pair of kingside pawns have just been exchanged leaving one white isolani on the kingside.
51,2,11,Rh8,b'7r/pp3k2/2p1p1p1/1P2RpP1/P1PP4/8/3K4/8 w - -',29. .......... Rh8 - white begins to centralise his king - his remaining rook is in a very strong position.  In a pure K & P ending black would be winning hands down.  But the rooks are on the board.  I decide to occupy the open h file with my rook.
52,2,12,Ke6,b'7r/pp6/4k1p1/1P1R1pP1/P7/8/3K4/8 w - -',32 ........ Ke6 - a couple of queenside pawns from both sides have disappeared from the board.  I retain my pawn advantage.
53,2,13,Kd6,b'7r/pp6/3k2p1/1PR2pP1/P7/8/3K4/8 w - -',33. ........ Kd6 - the black king tries to prevent a rook incursion into the heart of my position.
54,2,14,3bxa6,b'8/p7/P2k2p1/5pPr/8/6R1/3K4/8 b - -',38. bxa6 - one more pair of pawns from both sides disappears from the board.  Can I convert this one pawn advantage?  Things now start hotting up a bit.
55,2,15,Ra3+,b'8/p7/P1k3p1/5pP1/8/r1K1R3/8/8 w - -',41. Ra3  - hip hip hooray!  A king and pawn ending!  White cannot avoid this.  I think that my 39th move with the rook to a2 attacking the a pawn set this up.  I can pick off the white a pawn with my king if I wish but after analysing the board I find I can safely shepherd my passer on the f file home to queen and this is exactly what happens now.
56,2,16,4Kxe3,b'8/p7/P1k3p1/5pP1/8/4K3/8/8 b - -',43. Kxe3 - the takeback forces the white king backwards so Kd5 cannot be prevented.
57,2,17,4Kf3,b'8/p7/P3k1p1/5pP1/8/5K2/8/8 b - -',45. Kf3 - white can only move his king - therefore he must give way!  White is now in Zuggieland!!
58,2,18,4Kf2,b'8/p7/P5p1/5kP1/5p2/8/5K2/8 b - -',48. Kf2 - again the white king is being forced backwards.
59,2,19,Kg4,b'8/p7/P5p1/8/5pk1/8/4K3/8 w - -',50.......... Kg4 - the white king is prevented from going to f3.  Now the white king is to be forced back to the first rank.  I must watch out for the stalemate trap.
60,2,20,f2,b'8/p7/P5p1/8/8/6k1/5p2/5K2 w - -',53.......... f2 - the killer - the white king has only 1 legal move - e2.
61,2,21,Kg2,b'8/p7/P5p1/8/8/8/4Kpk1/8 w - -',54. ............... Kg2 - there is no way white can prevent f1/Q.  He now throws in the sponge.  Although this was an unrated game it was only my third victory against 1600  opposition.  
62,3,0,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. .......... Qf6 - the Greco Defence - slammed as a dodgy defence because it prevents the king knight from coming to f3 and the queen could be a target.  However this opening has more to it than meets the eye!
63,3,1,Qd6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2pq4/6B1/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',5. ........... Qd6 - the last few moves have been the standard way for white to meet this type of opening to develop normally with 3. Nc3 and to challenge the centre with 4. d4 which temporarily gives up a pawn.  White will soon get it back as you will see.
64,3,2,Be3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',8. Be3 - the queens have been exchanged and although the white dsb has been driven back to e3 white has a lead in development.
65,3,3,Bd2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/8/1b1NP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',9. Bd2 - breaks pin avoiding doubletons and isolanis on the queenside.

67,3,5,1Bc4,b'rnb1k2r/pp1pn1p1/2p2p1p/8/2BNP3/2B5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',12. Bc4 - the lsb comes out and connects the rooks.
68,3,6,1Nb5,b'rnb1k2r/pp4p1/5p1p/1N1p4/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',15. Nb5 - the black d pawn is isolated and hanging and is about to drop off.
69,3,7,1Na6,b'r1b1k2r/pp4p1/n4p1p/1N1p4/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq -',15. ........ Na6 - guards against threatened knight fork on c7 but black now loses a pawn.
70,3,8,1Re1,b'r1b2rk1/pp4p1/n4p1p/1N1R4/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/2K1R3 b - -',17. Re1 - black castles but I bag the open e file with my rook first.
71,3,9,1Rdd1,b'r1b2rk1/p5p1/np3p1p/1N6/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',18. Rdd1 moves rook out of a Bb7 skewie.
72,3,10,Bd5,b'r4rk1/p5p1/np3p1p/3b4/3N4/2B3P1/PPP2P1P/2KRR3 w - -',20. Bd5 - attacking my a pawn.  The a pawn cannot be taken at the moment because the bishop could become snared by b3.
73,3,11,2Re1,b'4r1k1/p5p1/np3p1p/8/8/2B3P1/PPP2P1P/2K1R3 b - -',24. Re1 - my aggressive 21. Ne6 triggered off a plethora of exchanges and I now challenge the e file as the rook is backed up on e1 by my dsb.
74,3,12,Kxe8,b'4k3/p5p1/np3p1p/8/8/2B3P1/PPP2P1P/2K5 w - -',25. .............. Kxe8 - black deciding to bring his king closer to the centre chooses to move it to f7.  This allows me to simplify further by exchanging the last pair of rooks.  But the resulting B v Kt ending is not as simple as it looks.
75,3,13,Ke6,b'8/p5p1/np2kp1p/8/8/2B1K1P1/PPP2P1P/8 w - -',27. ............. Ke6 - the kings come in closer towards the centre.
76,3,14,Nd7,b'8/p2n2p1/1p2kp1p/8/3B4/4KPP1/PPP4P/8 w - -',29. ........ Nd7 - avoids exchanging into a K & P ending.
77,3,15,3a4,b'8/3n4/pp1k1ppp/8/PPPB4/3K1PP1/7P/8 b - a3',33. a4 - planning on creating a passer with my queenside pawn majority.
78,3,16,bxa5,b'8/3n4/3k4/p4ppp/P1PB4/3K1PPP/8/8 w - -',37. .......... b x a5 - I have a passer but black has succeeded in breaking up my queenside pawns.  I do not like the kingside much either.  I am thinking about black having a possible pawn break sac which might lead to a passer on the kingside.  Fortunately this does not materialise.
79,3,17,Kxc5,b'8/8/8/p1k2ppp/P1P5/4KPPP/8/8 w - -',41. ............ Kxc5 - black nearly pulls off a surprise win but I did some serious analyse the board and carefully calculated the next few moves to ensure that this did not happen.
80,3,18,4c5,b'8/8/8/p1P2ppp/k2K4/5PPP/8/8 b - -',44. c5 - material is even but the c pawn will crown first.
81,3,19,4Kd5,b'8/8/8/pkPK1ppp/8/5PPP/8/8 b - -',45. Kd5 - the next few moves are quite instructive into how to shepherd your passer to the queening square.
82,3,20,a3,b'8/2P5/1k1K4/5ppp/8/p4PPP/8/8 w - -',48. .......... a3 - the c pawn crowns next move.  Black threw in the sponge before he allowed this to happen.  This was my first Team Match victory for the Sneaky Knight's Team and against my opponent after a draw and two losses against him.
83,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Antijogo (1582) vs. stringplayer92 (annotator) (1682)

Some very sloppy opening mistakes but then I capitalize on his capturing of a poison pawn.  An easy example of the power of the initiative.  This tactic reminds me of the old ""see-saw"" tactic with the rooks...

Hope you enjoy."
84,4,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"I like this move because of the flexibility.  I can transpose into either the French or Sicilian both are openings I play.  Sometimes these ""different"" move orders will throw-off the players that simply copy opening books such as MCO."
85,4,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I made the choice to offer to transpose into the sicilian.  Though my main opening is the French I get tried of playing against the exchange variation all the time.  Against the 1500-1600 range many players play the exchange.  Psychologically I know that they are probably wanting to go into a simple game that is not in the main lines.

The idea is to bring pressure on the center with the c-pawn and  trade it for white's d-pawn. White has many responses sometimes allowing the trade sometimes avoiding it. There are many versions of the Sicilian some quiet and positional and others like the dragon (which I prefer) that are very sharp.

Normally I would avoid Nf6 until after I had played d6 in order to avoid e5 driving my f6 Knight away. In this case however I think e5 is overstretching for white and after I play Ng4 white will either have difficulty keeping his e5 pawn or at least be giving up initiative.

I'm not sure I really know what I'm talking about here. I do know however that I rarely regret taking the initiative. Initiative means that you are forcing your opponent to constantly respond to your plans rather than advancing on his own plans. To me the strongest aspect of 3 ... Nf6 is that it takes the initiative and will probably keep it for a few moves.

There is danger in Ng4 if white plays e5. My N is exposed to the white Q without the protection of the white bishop as soon as the white Knight moves from f3. I think that's not a problem though as the most likely place for the f3 N to move is to e5 and I can trade my g4 Knight for it there. Also if e5 is played I will be playing d6 shortly thereafter allowing my bishop to protect the Knight at g4.

This is a long comment and if this were simply an annotated game most of it would be unnecessary. However in a training game I'm trying to give all my thoughts in why I chose a move even if it exposes my plans to my opponent."

Bd3 allows a quick castle but that benefit is small compared to the drawbacks. That is especially true in a Sicilian where black's development is always slow anyway. in a Sicilian quick development and limiting black's space and development is what you want. Notice that Black's K and Q pawns have not moved yet. The white King is in no danger and has no need to hurry into castling.

I wrote a lot about e5 on the last move. I don't think e5 would be a good move here but I do think it's better than Bd3. I'm not a master so I can't see all the ramifications of e5 but it seems like overextension to me. "

That may be impossible but black is trying. f4 is an excellent spot for black's knight attacking d3 g2 and h3. At some point e5 will allow it to be defended by a pawn there and allow black's Q to get into the game quickly. White's b-1 knight is at least two moves away from challenging that square. g3 isn't a real good option for white because of weakening the Q-side (or giving away the h3 pawn if white has castled).

The reasons for the move are that it attacks the g7 pawn and puts pressure on d3 and h3. It may force castling though white may have done anyway. e5 will follow protecting the N and opening up the King Bishop and the king side to the Queen. White has developed slowly so this move is aggressive for possible rapid aggression on black's part."

The idea is to get my pieces in play rapidly while the white pieces are on the Q-side. This not only frees my King Bishop but it opens the g-file if white trades his B for my f4 N and further blocks his mobility when I retake. the g5 pawn can also go to g4 to boot the f3 Knight should I decide it's worth eliminating the h3 and g2 pawns. It is highly dangerous because my Q-side isn't real suitable for castling and it wouldn't be too hard to open up the e-file if my King stays in the middle.

As Black's two pawn moves have severely restricted his Knights he should worry about getting his Bishops to active squares first. Moves like ...Bg4 ...Bb4 and ...Bc5 should be Black's first priority. Especially the moves that pin the Knights because he's already squandered away two full tempos and pawns. He should first try to restrain and then try to undermine White's center.

Of course by not playing Be3 White has chosen to the pawn on f2 vulnerable. However that pawn doesn't really need to be defended as White will be able to castle in two moves and Black can't take advantage of its vulnerability fast enough.

(I didn't cover it in the last comment because it happened here). While White is happy to play his Bishop to g3 for defence Black is suddenly able aim his guns at the center with ...Bg7. Also he gets to kick off his pawn storm with a tempo! It's a good thing that White hasn't committed to castling yet because now he can castle queenside and punish Black's choice not to wait to play g5 until White had committed.

However White has decided to blow apart the center for a reason: He wants to punish Black for his utter lack of development. It looks like it would have been stronger to first apply pressure to the center via h4 and then moves like Bc4 Qe2 and O-O-O but this isn't bad."

If Black takes the pawn on h4 then White will get a key foothold into the position with his Bishop. However if Black chooses to advance the pawn to g4 then the c1-h6 diagonal will open up for White's Bishop or Queen to use later. White's dark-squared Bishop can get the same foothold by playing from g3-f4-g5 if he decides that's how he wants to continue. Either way Black's position gets more dangerous.

Although he holds a nice pin on the f6 Knight his pieces have all fallen back to the third rank and his position feels passive. Though White is still way ahead in development his pieces need to be repositioned so they are more effective.

525,22,6,Bxa2,b'6k1/5pp1/p6p/1p6/4Pn2/4NP2/bPP2KPP/3B4 w - -',23. ......... Bxa2 - after a plethora of exchanges black wins back one of his pawns but I hang on to my pawn plus right into the endgame.

529,22,10,3Be2,b'8/8/p1nk1p2/1p4pp/1P2PP2/2P1K1PP/4B3/8 b - -',35. Be2 - the h pawn is en prise.  Black misses this by playing 35....... Ne7? so I regain my 2 pawn advantage.
530,22,11,Nc6,b'8/8/p1nk1p2/1p5B/1P2PP2/2P1K2P/8/8 w - -',37. .......... Nc6 - I now have a passer on the h file and this pawn will seal the victory for me.  Over the next two moves black shunts his steed from c6 to e7 while I amass my forces.

533,22,14,Nf7,b'8/5n1P/p1k2p2/1p3B2/1P1KPP2/2P5/8/8 w - -',44. ......... Nf7 - black is reduced to shunting his knight between h8 and f7.
534,22,15,4Kxc4,b'7n/7P/p1k5/4PB2/1PK5/8/8/8 b - -',48. Kxc4 - another two pawns are exchanged.  The only potential mating material black now has is the a pawn.  Black moves his knight to f7 for the last time.
535,22,16,Nd6+,b'8/7P/p1knP3/5B2/1PK5/8/8/8 w - -',49........... Nd6  - this knight fork wins the bishop on f5.  I now move my king to d3 out of range of any further spite checks from the steed.  Black cannot prevent h8/Q next move so he throws in the sponge.  Another much needed victory for my team!

White had excellent development compared to Black at this point and I think castling king side would have been better.  Black's thoughts at this point were to develop pieces towards a major queen side attack.
544,23,7,d5,b'rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1p1p4/3NP3/2NBBQ2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq -',d5 opens up the threatening line of Black's dark squared bishop.  White's knight on c3 becomes the hamstring of white's defense.

Black also will have both bishops which will prove key to the final attack.
549,23,12,1cxd4,b'r6r/1b1k1p1p/1q2p1p1/p1bpP3/3P1B2/6Q1/PP2NPPP/2KR3R b - -',White would've been better by taking with the Knight instead.  By taking with the pawn black has an even better line to the King.

552,23,15,2Na2,b'r4b1r/3k1p1p/bq2p1p1/3pP3/p2P1B2/P5Q1/NP3PPP/1K1R3R b - -',Again the knight has danced around for a few moves but eventually winds up back on c3 where it prevents White from adequately defending the king.

556,23,19,Qc2,b'1r3b1r/3k1p1p/4p1p1/3pP3/p1b5/P1N3Q1/1PqB1PPP/KR1R4 w - -',Again Black misses the opportunity this time it could have worked because the pawn on b2 could not advance.

563,24,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bb5 - this is the start of the Ruy Lopez (known as the Spanish Torture).  This move puts pressure on black's e5 although after the bishop captures the knight and black recaptures with the d pawn the e pawn cannot be taken immediately because of a queen fork on d4.
564,24,1,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3....... a6 - this is the standard defence to this called the Morphy Defence puts the question to the lsb.

Now here's a lesson for you just don't do what I do later on exchange down to a king and pawn ending with the pawn structure as it is now.  As you will see you will lose!  You will lose!  I got suckered into playing into the K & P ending because I have never been in a K & P ending with an Expert 500 points north of my rating with material even before and I though I would be OK because my king was more centralised than my opponent's.  My opponent quashed this illusion and gave me a thorough lesson in how to exploit this type of K & P ending!

A more aggressive choice in the DB is Bg5 but f6 is more my style - f6 backs up the e pawn.  My knight will go to e7 on move 12 after castling queenside.
567,24,4,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',7. Nxd4 - one pair of pawns has been exchanged and relieves pressure on e5.  I now advance my pawn to c5 to drive back the knight.

I rejected this move because I did not want an isolani as well as my doubleton on the c file.  I admit to following the database but I did assess each move very carefully before making the decision to play it and I chose the line which I felt best suited my style which I mentioned in an earlier note.  In hindsight though would Be5 have been a better move than the one I chose?
573,24,10,Bf7,b'2kr3r/1pp1nbpp/p4p2/2p5/4PN2/2N5/PPPR1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',14. ............ Bf7 - after white recaptured on f4 I backed my bishop off to f7 moving it out of range of the knight on f5 and contesting control of the d5 square.

This triggered off a plethora of exchanges ending in the position I have now.  The king and pawn ending that I mentioned in an earlier note.  My position is about to go way down south!  I am just wondering whether instead of contesting the d file with my rook I would have been better served by playing b6 to back up my frontal c pawn and then playing my rook to e8 putting pressure on e5.  You the jury decide!

Although the f and g (the g pawn could be used to decoy the black king onto the g file) pawns may fall the WK could get to the queenside before the BK and gobble up all my queenside pawns.
585,24,22,Kf6,b'8/8/2p2k2/p1p1pP2/P1P3P1/5K2/8/8 w - -',37. ..... Kf6 - stopping the f pawn's advance and guarding the e5 pawn but for how long?

I am now in Zugzwang - any move I make now will result in the e pawn dropping off.  If I play Kg5 I will be able to take Paolo's g pawn in exchange but he will then crown his f pawn.  So there ends the lesson.

Take it as a quiz. 
First of all open the java window so that you can see the flow of the game with my comments on the bottom. Flip the board as you will be playing the black side.
Then cover with a sheet the part of the screen with the moves. Don't look at the moves.
From time to time you will be asked to find a move on your own. When you read ""IT'S YOUR TURN"" you'll have to decide what move to make. MAKE SURE to have a plan behind the move you want to make or to have the CORRECT tactical idea otherwise IT'S LIKE YOU DID NOT ANSWER CORRECTLY. The first moves are theoretical and there will be no questions. Anyway try to figure out what's going on.
There are 10 points available in total (some questions give 2 points or more others give 1 point). At the end tell me your score!
I think that players above 1800 should have few problems in analysing this game but for those under 1500/1600 might be interesting.
Good luck and enjoy!

In fact white will lose some important tempos to capture those pawns. Now Black must play vigorously to undermine white's centre and take the initiative.

Black has almost completed development though his pieces still need to find more aggressive posts to become really dangerous. White on the other side is still back in development but if he manages to free himself he will be able to count on his strong passed h2 pawn. Black has a dynamic advantage (development and if he can initiative) while White has a static advantage (material and pawn structure)

The fact is that there was a fight for the d4 square. If white managed to take control of that square he will probably be able to complete smoothly his development. Moreover the pawn on d5 was a negative factor for Black because his pieces didn't have space enough. After that pawn disappears the scope of the Rd8 the Bd7 and the Ne7 will be greatly increased. So many good things for just one pawn! Think Dynamic!

Add 2 more points if you also had in mind the following plan: exchange as many minor pieces as possible. In few moves we will see why."

Attacking the Queen this way Black exchanges the last minor piece and he will finally GET the INITIATIVE because of his powerful and active Rooks against an uncastled king and those poor undeveloped Rooks. Moreover white now cannot take in a7 because of 19...Qc3 .
Not 18...Kb8? 19.Qd6!
Nor 18...Bc6 19. Qxa7! are good.
IMPORTANT: As you can see Black is exchanging pieces even if is is down in material. You have probably been taught that when you have a material advange you should try to reach the endgame. BE CAREFUL with this approach! Don't always look for exchange of pieces when you are up with material. Instead try to understand what is best to do in that situation! Sometimes it is necessary to fight with great determination even with a pawn up or two because the player down in material may have some sort of dynamic compensation. In this case for example the more developed white pieces disappear the bigger will be the difference in development between black and white. "

I like it because it can transpose to the King's Gambit declined if black plays e5 here (or even back to the King's Gambit Accepted) which can be fun but it moreover immediately challenges black's decision to play the Pirc declaring an intent to pawn-storm the kingside.  That and it invites transposition to the austrian attack (main line) of the Pirc as well.

This will work out okay only if black can neutralize white's kingside attack or start his own quick counterattack which he's unable to do.

It starts from a quiet double-king pawn opening and becomes a double-edged game with attacking possibilities for both sides.  Most of the action is created when we castle on opposite sides leading to a bit of a race to the king.  Enjoy!

Whatever disadvantage comes from the bishop's lack of mobility early is made up for later.

With the kings on opposite sides the potential for full-scale onslaughts on both sides of the board emerges.  This game turns into a race; however with my development I'm ahead already.  Also notice that my g2 bishop is potentially a very good piece if I can open the center.

Better is Qd7 followed by Rdg8 trying to spring the king.  With this move however my attack is able to come full force.

After Nxc6 the king can't get out fast enough to escape from my rooks.  I didn't even consider Ra7 during the game.  I had planned to play Ra8 and Rb1 to finish him off.  There really isn't a way for him to escape here so me missing mate wasn't too crucial.

People don't play it too often here since altough it is full of traps and zaps for black and gives him lot to think about it is most probably a little unsound.
894,39,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the Gambit. White gets a tempo open lines and space advantage for the price of pawn.

Later in the game we'll see that altough doubled black has no queenside pawn majority so the doubled pawns are maybe not so weak. This is probably what white expected when playing 8.Qe2 as the queens rook may be active on his original square after eventual hxg3.

930,39,37,3Qxd7,b'2r3k1/3Q2pp/p2q1p2/1pNPr3/1P1p3P/6P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 b - -',Otherwise black just wins another pawn.
931,39,38,3Nc5,b'2r3k1/6pp/p4p2/1pNr4/1P1p3P/6P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 b - -',Now black needs to find yet again a plan to penetrate. I admit that at this point I didn't give this game too much attention thinking it to be winning and not bother to find the best plan and just plan and then move when I have to... Very unhealthy approach.
932,39,39,3a5,b'2r3k1/6pp/5p2/ppNr4/1P1p3P/6P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 w - -',Just advancing making eventual penetration more dangerous.
933,39,40,3Nd3,b'2r3k1/6pp/5p2/pp1r4/1P1p3P/3N2P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 b - -',The best.
934,39,41,3a4,b'2r3k1/6pp/5p2/1p1r4/pP1p3P/3N2P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 w - -',Locking the queenside with the idea that if the b-pawn falls then the whole position falls.
935,39,42,3Nc5,b'2r3k1/6pp/5p2/1pNr4/pP1p3P/6P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 b - -',Knight takes his rightful post back. 
936,39,43,Re8,b'4r3/5kpp/8/1pNr1p2/pP1p1P1P/6P1/1P1R2K1/8 w - -',There were nothing in the c-file I guess.
937,39,44,3Kf2,b'4r3/5kpp/8/1pNr1p2/pP1p1P1P/6P1/1P1R1K2/8 b - -',White cannot prevent penetration.
938,39,45,4Rxd4,b'8/5kpp/8/1pNr1p2/pP1R1P1P/4r1P1/1P3K2/8 b - -',This was whites idea but while it works tactically it fails positionally. White should have tried to show that the rook does nothing on e3 and try to drive it aways from there or prevent Kg6-h5-g4.
939,39,46,4Nd3,b'8/5kpp/8/1p3p2/pr3P1P/3NK1P1/1P6/8 b - -',Now for having been on defence more or less the whole game black now want's to have his time for fun.
940,39,47,4Rxb2,b'8/5kpp/8/1p3p2/p4P1P/3NK1P1/1r6/8 w - -',Remember what I said about the b-pawn? Knight are very poor in stopping rook's pawns.
941,39,48,a3,b'8/5kpp/8/1p3p2/5P1P/p3K1P1/1N6/8 w - -',And the pawn queens. The knight is useless. The funny thing is that if black queen were 'in the box' say at d3 the knight would be worse than useless taking b2 away from the king losing.
942,39,49,a2,b'8/5kpp/8/1p3p2/5P1P/6P1/pN1K4/8 w - -',axb2 is of course winning king-and-pawn ending but why not to queen if one can?
