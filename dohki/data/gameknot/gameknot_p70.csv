31,2,2,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/4P3/1NN3Q1/PPP1BPPP/3RK2R w K -',I see a lot of Schevingenin games where the rook goes to e8 rather than d8. But I typically play it to d8 to support the d5 push. There is a risk of the f6 knight getting pinned and reduced mobility for the e7 bishop but so far I haven't been punished for placing the rook on d8. Still waiting to see why so many players in international play place the rook on e8.

My buddy Gerhard/Chicoboy asked me to annotate this brevity.  His Class C opponent Dan resigned presumably because he thought he was gonna cop Old Matey.  However Gameknot Analysis provided a way out for Dan although it did state that Dan had a positional disadvantage of exactly 1 point - so I guess there was a potential for a resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material x moves down the line.  So how did all this happen?  Well read on......"

We have all been there and if and when we resign we make the decision that seems right at the time and to the best of our knowledge.  I will therefore be contacting both players respective mentors regarding this result for their valuable input.  Anyhow Gerhard kudos to you - you have kept your rating in the 1300s for quite a while now and are nudging up to 1350 - keep it up!  As for you Dan I know only too well what you are capable of when you are at the top of your game against Class A 1800 oppo. and I can see your rating get back into the mid-1500s sooner or later ......

187,8,2,Nbxd2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Trade off of the DSBs and protecting the e-pawn. I'm fairly happy with this as attacks/pins on f2 are a lot harder without the DSB for black and white still has the LSB to do the equivalent attacks on f7.
188,8,3,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/2BPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq d6',Forcing the e-pawn off.

190,8,5,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3n4/2BP4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Both sides take the kings out of the exposed centre and prepare to bring the K-side rooks into action.

194,8,9,1Re1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n3b1/3n4/2BP2P1/5N1P/PP1N1P2/2RQR1K1 b - -',Simply staking a claim on the e-file.
195,8,10,1Nf1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/1nn3b1/8/2BP2P1/5N1P/PP3P2/2RQRNK1 b - -',I made this move just to reposition the knight and add a bit of support to d4 althouth it allows black to swap a knight for a bishop on a fairly open board. I don't think there are really any particularly good places to put the bishop though.
196,8,11,1Ng3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1nppp/6b1/8/2RP2P1/5NNP/PP3P2/3QR1K1 b - -',Following the exchange the knight finishes its repositioning manoeuvre. This also leaves blacks LSB with no squares to move to so it's going nowhere for a while.
197,8,12,1Qb3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1npp1/6bp/8/2RP2P1/1Q3NNP/PP3P2/4R1K1 b - -',Attacking the unprotected b-pawn. Clearly not the most impressive threat however the main idea was just to try and cause black to weaken her position remain on the back foot and leave some targets to aim for.

199,8,14,2Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1nppb/1p5p/4N3/2RP2P1/5QNP/PP3P2/4R1K1 b - -',Putting more pressure on c6 also leaves the f8 rook unable to move due to the double attack on f7.

201,8,16,2Qxc6,b'r2q1rk1/p1p3pb/1pQ2p1p/8/2RP2P1/6NP/PP3P2/4R1K1 b - -',Following the exchange the c7 pawn now needs extra support.
202,8,17,2Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/p1p3pb/1pQ2p1p/8/2RP2P1/6NP/PP3P2/4R1K1 w - -',Black defends the c pawn although this isn't an ideal square for a rook.
203,8,18,2Re3,b'2rq1rk1/p1p3pb/1pQ2p1p/8/2RP2P1/4R1NP/PP3P2/6K1 b - -',Re3 with the idea of putting all the heavy pieces down the c file then maybe playing Qe6+ or similar and trying to get a rook onto the 7th rank. Have to say that I didn't see an actual way of forcing this plan though but perhaps with enough pressure black will allow a way in.
204,8,19,2Qd6,b'2r2rk1/p1p3pb/1pQq1p1p/8/2RP2P1/4R1NP/PP3P2/6K1 w - -',Black offers the exchange of queens.

206,8,21,Rxa2,b'6k1/6p1/1p1R1pbp/8/3P2P1/6NP/r4P2/6K1 w - -',One of the few moves the computer analysis doesn't like in this game suggesting that advancing the b-pawn was preferable. The suggested line seems to show that keeping white tied with with watching the b pawn and trying not to lose the a-pawn would make it difficult to make use of the passed d pawn.
207,8,22,3Rxb6,b'6k1/6p1/1R3pbp/8/3P2P1/6NP/r4P2/6K1 b - -',Following the exchanges white is up by the passed d pawn although the imbalance of minor pieces maybe favours black.
208,8,23,3Rb4,b'6k1/6p1/5pbp/8/1R1P2P1/6NP/3r1P2/6K1 b - -',White must defend the pawn the plan now much be to try and bring up the king or knight to support it to allow the pawn to make progress.
209,8,24,3Nf5,b'8/5bpk/5p1p/5N2/1R1P2PP/3r4/5PK1/8 b - -',Not so much supporting the d pawn as planning to move to e3 so that the pawn could advance to d5 at some point. One advantage of having the knight vs bishop is that the pawn is relatively safe as long as it is on a dark square however white needs to be careful whenever he attempts to push the pawn onto a light square that the bishop can reach.
210,8,25,3Ne3,b'8/6pk/5p1p/3b4/1R1P2PP/4N3/3r1P1K/8 b - -',Black cannot take the f pawn due to the response Kg1 with an attack on both black pieces that cannot both be saved. (Note not Kg3?? as Rf3+ saves both pieces and loses the knight).
211,8,26,3Kg3,b'8/6pk/5p1p/8/1R1Pb1PP/4N1K1/3r1P2/8 b - -',The bishop moves out of the knights reach so the King must defend f2 although it wanted to move towards the centre anyway so this is no problem.
212,8,27,3Kf4,b'8/6pk/5p1p/8/1R1PbKPP/3rN3/5P2/8 b - -',The king continues to head towards the centre to support the d-pawn with tempo as the bishop must move to save itself.

214,8,29,4Kg3,b'8/6pk/2b2p1p/7P/1R1P2P1/4N1K1/3r1P2/8 b - -',White has to go back again to defend.
215,8,30,Be4,b'8/6pk/5p1p/7P/2RPb1P1/3rN1K1/5P2/8 w - -',I think this may have been a mistake as it allows white to advance the king with tempo if the bishop had moved to a8 black could have simply threatened the f pawn if the white king went to f4 again.
216,8,31,4Kf4,b'8/6pk/5p1p/7P/2RPbKP1/3rN3/5P2/8 b - -',Advancing the king with tempo.
217,8,32,Ba8,b'b7/6pk/5p1p/5K1P/2RP2P1/3rN3/5P2/8 w - -',Another move the computer analysis didn't like which suggests Rd2 threatening the f pawn again. The king is quite committed to going forward now so white would not have attempted to hold the f-pawn but the loss of the f pawn may have made the rest of the game trickier.
218,8,33,4d5,b'b7/6pk/4Kp1p/3P3P/2R3P1/1r2N3/5P2/8 b - -',Finally with the king's support the d pawn can advance.
219,8,34,4Bxd5+,b'8/6pk/4Kp1p/3b3P/2R3P1/1r2N3/5P2/8 w - -',Black apparently decides that the pawn is unstoppable without the loss of a piece. That was my assessment as well really although the analysis suggests Rb6+ is better although the line it give also ultimately involves sacrificing a piece for the pawn.
220,8,35,Rf3,b'8/6pk/4Kp1p/3N3P/2R3P1/5r2/5P2/8 w - -',Finally threatening to take the f pawn to allow some counter-play.
221,8,36,4Rc7,b'8/2R3pk/4Kp1p/3N3P/6P1/5r2/5P2/8 b - -',I could see a possible mate here so decided not to bother saving the f pawn black's king has very little movement available here and should the black rook move from the f-file white can play Nxf6+ with a probable follow up of Rd8# as the g pawn is pinned. Getting the knight to g6 also looks like a plan with a sort of arabian mate in the corner.
222,8,37,4Ne7,b'8/2R1N1pk/4Kp1p/7P/6P1/8/5r2/8 b - -',The knight heads off to g6 to play for the arabian mate there doesn't look to be much defence for black now it will take too long to pick off all the white pawns.
223,8,38,4Kf7,b'8/2R1NKpk/5p1p/7P/6P1/8/4r3/8 b - -',The white king simply steps out of the check and helps box the black king in.

252,11,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Now white has several options.. The most popular (according to GK Game DB) is 3. Nc3 which is leading to the Classical Variation. Second popular is 3. e5 the Advance Variation. Third is 3. exd5 the Exchange Variation.

Qxd3 but you have to keep in mind that most of black's pawns are on white squares.. So why trade the light-squared-bishop ?? He can be useful in the endgame !

It tends to discourage Black's planned ...e7-e5 advance but at the cost of presenting Black's b-pawn with a target unless White is prepared to pay a price in time.

GM O'Kelly de Galway called this 'the most active continuation preparing a counter-attack on the White KP [e-pawn].'

It was with the latter move Bobby Fischer came within an ace of defeating Mischa Tal in the 1959 Candidates' Tournament.  After 8.f4 b4?! Tal got himself into all sorts of trouble:  9.Na4 Nxe4  10.0-0 g6  11.f5! gxf5  12.Nxf5! Rg8   13.Bd5! Ra2.  Note Tal's 8th and 9th moves - the thematic idea behind Black's play.

It may well have been White's purpose to draw forward the h-pawn weakening Black's K-side slightly and creating a target for a later K-side attack.  Returning to the centre this bishop is well placed to intervene on either flank.

It seems that Black ought indeed to have taken the Knight and then clung on in the face of White's assault: 13...fxe6!  14.Qh5ch Kd7! -(We surmise that the GK engine's choice ...Ke7 is insufficient though that has yet to be definitively determined).  At this point White might well fling everything into the assault: 15.Bxd5!? exd5  16.Rxd5ch Bxd5  17.Qxd5ch Nd6! -(any King move gets axed)- 18.Re1! ... -(the straight-forward 18.Qxa8 is playable too by the look)-  18...Be7 -(What else?  Not 18...Nc6 that's for sure: 19.Nc5ch!)-  19.Qxa8.  At this point White would be a piece behind still but with so active a game could still fancy her winning chances.

After a complex middle game - which the post-match computer analysis (pmca) says Black makes a couple of mistake. It comes down to a queen v 2 rooks ending. The computer thinks I made a mistake but my opponent says it was drawn anyway. Is he right? And if he is right were his two ""mistakes"" really mistakes if he was holding the position anyway. Is the pmca right or is my opponent right? Please study and tell me your views dear reader."
633,22,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So it starts conventionally enough
634,22,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I continue with my usual
635,22,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black prepares to develop his Bf8 to g7
636,22,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So I continue and threaten e2-e4

638,22,6,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I continue with the exchange variation the most popular reply. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4
639,22,7,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So he takes back
640,22,8,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',I seize the centre or center as my American friends would say
641,22,9,Nxc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He takes - the usual continuation

643,22,11,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He continues with development. White can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2 often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5 playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s however Karpov Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside.
644,22,12,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',With this move I am planning on playing Rb1 next move.

646,22,14,Rb1,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/1RBQKB1R b Kkq -',So I do my rook move.
647,22,15,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/1RBQKB1R w K -',He castles
648,22,16,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R b K -',This is the usual square for the bishop in this variation
649,22,17,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R w K -',So he develops.
650,22,18,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2pP4/4P3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R b K -',And I hit the knight going into very complicated variations! Black can take the pawn on c3 with his Bishop with check but after Bc1-d2 Black has to part with his powerful black squared bishop as his knight on c6 is hanging. After Bxc3+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 white has full compensation for the sacrifices pawn so black doesn't normally accept the offered pawn.
651,22,19,1Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pPn3/4P3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R w K -',This is the usual move
652,22,20,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pPN3/4P3/2P5/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R b K -',So I take

655,22,23,1Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1pp1p/6p1/2pPb3/4P3/1RP5/P3BPPP/2BQK2R w K -',Now I can't play 0-0 as he can meet that with Bxh2 check
656,22,24,1c4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1pp1p/6p1/2pPb3/2P1P3/1R6/P3BPPP/2BQK2R b K -',So I consolidate my centre and make it possible for my rook to swing across the third rank.

658,22,26,1h3,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2p1p/4p1p1/2pPb3/2P1P3/1R5P/P3BPP1/2BQK2R b K -',So I prepare to castle

Kh1 which it says is only plus 0.25 to white as opposed to the game continuation which is ranks as plus 0.89 for white. Is this really true?

813,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',White playes e4. I play e4 myself too. The downside of e4 is that it allows black to decide what kind of game it's gonna be. King's pawn game e5 pirc d6 french e6 caro kann c6 sicilian c5 scandinavian d5 and there are even more variations. There are a lot less variations in other openings white can play.
814,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',But I play this move e5. 
815,26,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Attacks the pawn and develops a piece.
816,26,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Protects the pawn and develops a piece. d6 is sometimes played but I don't like it becuase it locks the bsb.
817,26,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the italian game and I play it myself too.
818,26,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Most common reply. Now Nxe5 doesn't work because of 4Nxe5 Nxe5 5 d4 Nxc4 and white simply lost a piece.
819,26,6,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',This is not played a lot it simply loses a pawn. However because I was not concentrated enough I chose the wrong piece to hit the pawn. 
820,26,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Taking with either the pawn or the bishop (I prefer the bishop) is much better
821,26,8,Ng5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p1N1/2BnP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But white didn't see he could simply play Nxe5 here which has the same effect as this. A bit of luck on my side.
822,26,9,Ne6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4n3/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Nh6 is also possible here but at least it forces white to do something because white's knight is attacked twice and only defended once with the queen.
823,26,10,Bxe6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4B3/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White decided to trade his bishop for the knight.

The queenside is OK for black. Nc6 is another option but if black takes on a7 then the knight could have problems getting to safety. So maybe that is why white played this so he could retreat to b5.

865,26,52,3Rd7,b'6k1/2pr2p1/1p2p3/4P1p1/1Pb5/P5N1/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Now I take the open file here.

873,26,60,3f4,b'6k1/6p1/1pp1p3/1b2P1N1/1P3P2/P3r3/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',White defends his pawn very easily.

877,26,64,3Ra1,b'6k1/6p1/1pp1N3/1b2P3/1P3P2/1r6/6PP/R5K1 b - -',This move is a mistake as discussed in the previous move.

884,26,71,4e6,b'8/6p1/1p2P1k1/1bp3N1/1r3P2/6P1/7P/4R1K1 b - -',White moves the pawn
885,26,72,4c4,b'8/6p1/1p2P1k1/1b4N1/1rp2P2/6P1/7P/4R1K1 w - -',But I dont seem to care and move my pawn too!
886,26,73,4e7,b'8/4P1p1/1p4k1/1b4N1/1rp2P2/6P1/7P/4R1K1 b - -',This move is actually not good. Black should have played Ne4 probably.
887,26,74,4c3,b'8/4P1p1/1p4k1/1b4N1/1r3P2/2p3P1/7P/4R1K1 w - -',I push the pawn.
888,26,75,4Re6+,b'8/4P1p1/1p2R1k1/1b4N1/1r3P2/2p3P1/7P/6K1 b - -',Now black is making some serious mistakes. I can play Kh5 but then white will promote with check. I think Kf5 is better.
889,26,76,4Re5+,b'8/4P1p1/1p6/1b2RkN1/1r3P2/2p3P1/7P/6K1 b - -',Now he checks me again If I play Kf6 then white could play Nh7 and it would still be check if he promotes.
890,26,77,4Kg4,b'8/4P1p1/1p6/1b2R1N1/1r3Pk1/2p3P1/7P/6K1 w - -',So I moved here.

892,26,79,4c2,b'8/4P1p1/1p6/1R4N1/1r3Pk1/6P1/2p4P/6K1 w - -',Now I could force a draw. If he promotes I promote and check the king endlessly because he can't escape to h3 or f3 (isn't that funny?) He probably saw this too and made the next blunder.
893,26,80,4h3+,b'8/4P1p1/1p6/1R4N1/1r3Pk1/6PP/2p5/6K1 b - -',A serious blunder. If I play Kh5 ofcourse the game is over for black.

907,26,94,Ka3,b'8/1r4p1/8/8/8/k3K2P/1p4R1/8 w - -',Now he resigned. If he played Rg3 I had the nasty Rb3+ which won the game the fastest. This proves that having a pawn more in a rook endgame is a winning position. If you have any comments feel free to do so!
908,27,0,g4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P2P1/8/PPP2P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',Here we have one of the more aggressive white continuations against the Caro-Kann.
909,27,1,Be4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3Pb1P1/8/PPP2P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Since white has indicated a willingness to be aggressive I decide to see if he'll advance his f pawn. This can be dangerous for black but usually a little preparation by white first is wiser; white's king is not yet safe. The best response now is for white to play f3.
910,27,2,f3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3Pb1P1/5P2/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Which he does. And of course black really has only one thing to do.
911,27,3,h4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/3pP3/3P2PP/5P2/PPP5/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3',White is continuing now with an aggressive pawn storm with zero pieces developed! He hopes to blow black off the board entirely. Black has two responses h5 or h6. But h6 is not nearly as good as h5 because h6 is extremely passive while h5 allows black to fight back. I saw a video of this position where a grandmaster stated (but not a 'super' grandmaster) that h5 was good for black. Fritz agrees.
912,27,4,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p1P1b1/3p3p/3P2PP/5P2/PPP5/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is really overaggressive now on white's part. He wishes to disrupt the pawn structure immediately in front of the black king even before he's really ready to. Fritz here wanted Qd6 here and ...fxe6 is also playable. I however decided I did not want a trio of pawns assaulting the black position after g5. It just seems too dangerous!
913,27,5,hxg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p1P1b1/3p4/3P2pP/5P2/PPP5/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I create room for my rook on h8 to have a say in matters first. Now all evaluations are somewhat negative as well. White responds with Frit'z choice...
914,27,6,fxg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pbp1/2p5/3p4/3P2PP/8/PPP5/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Almost any move here is safe for black now: e6 e5 Nd7 Nf6 or what I moved Qd6. With all of these pawns gone white's challenge is to find a way to keep the black king under attack. This white plan could have been a bit harder to refute had he prepared a bit before launching all those pawns!
915,27,7,Qd6,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pbp1/2pq4/3p4/3P2PP/8/PPP5/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This also prepares to castle queenside; ...Nd7 e6 or e5 and Ne7 or f6 will all be considered depending on white's response here. Qc7 may have been better.
916,27,8,1Kf2,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pbp1/2pq4/3p4/3P2PP/8/PPP2K2/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',Now the awkwardness of white's position begins to become apparent. White decides he can't allow  ...Qg3 which depending could lose him the g and/or h pawns; but in so choosing loses a valuable tempo another move may have been able to accomplish while also being positioning closer to attack. Qe2 or Nf3 were white's best choices here but white decided on Kf2.
917,27,9,1Nf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pbp1/2pq1n2/3p4/3P2PP/8/PPP2K2/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',...Nd7 followed by castling queenside was also playable for black; Fritz likes Nf6 better and in the game so did I.
918,27,10,1Qf3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pbp1/2pq1n2/3p4/3P2PP/5Q2/PPP2K2/RNB2BNR b kq -',Here white indicates he will continue to assault aggressively the kingside if he can: in for a penny in for a pound appears to be his thinking. There are many continuations all very playable for black. But black must be careful to not allow white to get a dangerous push. Nbd7 is playable and Bg6 is possible here after which Bd3 Bxd3 cxd3 would most likely result doubling white's pawns on the d file. However I decide not to trade pieces and decide to create some tactical possibilities one which pays off in a bit. This was Blitz; so this thinking was done quickly.
919,27,11,1Ne4+,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pbp1/2pq4/3p4/3Pn1PP/5Q2/PPP2K2/RNB2BNR w kq -',This gets me a tempo for Nd7 after which I can then castle or begin to harass the pieces in front of white's king. Yes it would have been nice to have doubled white's pawns on the d file but now white's attack is really sputtering.
920,27,12,Nd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1npbp1/2pq4/3p4/3Pn1PP/5Q2/PPP3K1/RNB2BNR w kq -',The way is clear now to castle if I choose depending on how I handle the f7 bishop.
921,27,13,1Bd3,b'r3kb1r/pp1npbp1/2pq4/3p4/3Pn1PP/3B1Q2/PPP3K1/RNB3NR b kq -',Nd2 was also possible here.
922,27,14,1Bg6,b'r3kb1r/pp1np1p1/2pq2b1/3p4/3Pn1PP/3B1Q2/PPP3K1/RNB3NR w kq -',This move allows h5. Fritz much preferred ...e5. However white had already decided what he would do next and so the continuation starting with h5 was missed for a turn. I had another reason however for encouraging h5... a dubious reason as it turns out but oh well.
923,27,15,1Bf4,b'r3kb1r/pp1np1p1/2pq2b1/3p4/3PnBPP/3B1Q2/PPP3K1/RN4NR b kq -',Even here ...e5 is still a good move.
924,27,16,1Qe6,b'r3kb1r/pp1np1p1/2p1q1b1/3p4/3PnBPP/3B1Q2/PPP3K1/RN4NR w kq -',The position is becoming complex. White has disrupted the black kingside pawn structure and may win a pawn in return for dubious king safety and his own connected pawns being advanced a tad far. Note I can still castle; the white dark-squared bishop does not prevent it.
925,27,17,Bf7,b'r3kb1r/pp1npbp1/2p1q3/3p3P/3PnBP1/3B1Q2/PPP3K1/RN4NR w kq -',I thought about Bh7 and rejected it. I wanted the h file clear for my rook. What was the reason for ...Bg6? Was it worth the tempo? Not really; I gambled there. I wanted him to advance the h pawn and not the g pawn at this point so I could hopefully get in Nf6 after which advancing the g pawn would lose the h pawn and so my knight will be able to remain there for the time being and that is what I wanted. But white could after h5  immediately move g5 and then black will have trouble. It's getting cramped! And if I allow white too much leeway I'll be in for a difficult defense after all.
926,27,18,1Nh3,b'r3kb1r/pp1npbp1/2p1q3/3p3P/3PnBP1/3B1Q1N/PPP3K1/RN5R b kq -',But I lucked out; white is continuing with his plan rather than really seeing the board! g5 was better to prevent Nf6.
927,27,19,1Re1,b'r3kb1r/pp2pbp1/2p1qn2/3p3P/3PnBP1/3B1Q1N/PPP3K1/RN2R3 b kq -',Nd2 Nf2 Be2 were all equally good. This is in keeping with white's aggressiveness but with this move white has forgotten about his g pawn being double attacked.
928,27,20,dxe4,b'r3kb1r/pp2pbp1/2p5/7P/3PpBn1/7N/PPP3K1/RN2R3 w kq -',The e pawn is immune for the moment (...Bd5). My opponent would like to double attack it and moving the king to chase away the black knight seems like a good plan preventing a rook pin in the event of Rxe4 Bd5. But Nc3 Ng5 and Nd2 are somewhat better for white then Kg3.
929,27,21,Nf6,b'r3kb1r/pp2pbp1/2p2n2/7P/3PpB2/6KN/PPP5/RN2R3 w kq -',And sadly here my opponent ran out of time. The position is complex! The e4 and h pawns will both fall and with best play black should have more winning chances than white. But if the minor pieces go then this game would be rather drawish. A fun quick blitz game that I would have liked to see played further! Very interesting those pawn storms. ;)
930,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Now I looked at the game and as it mentions this starts off as the Sicilian Defense and becomes the open variation.
931,28,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So as I would expect white plays this to get another piece out.  But there's more to this then meets the eye.  I showed Jack Stockel this game and he told me that this is the proper and most common continuation of the Open Sicilian.
932,28,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I like this move as it is developing and it opens up a line for blacks DSB.  And believe it or not Szendrei kept this in mind because he will bring that out on his next move.
933,28,3,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',At first I did not know why white decided to retreat her LSB as opposed to developing her DSB.  Afterall it doesn't appear attacked and there was no danger.  I mean if say 7...d5 8.exd5 exd5 9.Nxd5 Nxd5  However a second look at this position shows why.  After say 10.Bxd5 10...Qxd5 so white loses a piece.  Now of course if I were playing this game I would've made that mistake and instead of 7.Bb3 I would of played something like 7.Be3??
934,28,4,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',As noted earlier black brings his DSB into play.  As it turns out this time it's what I'm thinking.  It turns out that black is planning to and will castle on his next move.
935,28,5,f4,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq f3',I do not know why JP played this.
936,28,6,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',As noted black castles.
937,28,7,Qf3,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Now I also wasn't sure why she moved here and brought the Q out before developing her DSB.  But Mr. Stockel told me that this is actually a very good.  And she played to come in attack his center and put a lot of pressure on the f file.  With this move white now has a slight edge believe it or not.
938,28,8,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',A developing move.  However in order to avoid the feeling of being crammed I would have played 9...Nc6 even if it meant exchanging Knights.  On the other hand my coach told me that this move was nearly forced and that 9...Nc6? would be a mistake.  This time however I don't why that would be so.
939,28,9,1g4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPPP1/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ g3',At first I wasn't sure why she played this so I asked Jack.  And he told me that it puts even more pressure on blacks K side.
940,28,10,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NPPP1/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now I like this move a lot as he's hitting her N.
941,28,11,1Nf5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/4pN2/4PPP1/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',"So this appears to be a retreat that's simply a better outpost then 11.Ne2.  However that isn't so.  Mr. Stockel accurately contradicted that when he said ""Wow white's getting really nasty.""  I agree and this time see why.  ""He better be careful from now on"" because white's N is very strong.  And if Szendrei doesn't watch out Judit Polgar can get both the Q and the N in action to expose black's K.  "
942,28,12,1Nc5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2n1pN2/4PPP1/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black moved here to exchange pieces with white which is about to happen.  However I don't know why he made this choice as opposed to preventing the threat.  Right now he has more important things to worry about and should be paying attention to that.  Having said that best was 11...g6! because of what I mentioned in the second sentence.
943,28,13,1g5,b'r1b2rk1/1p2qppp/p2p1n2/2n1p1P1/4PP2/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',So now white puts the squeeze on black with this move as opposed to the other way around as noted earlier.  
944,28,14,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nqppp/p2p4/2n1pPP1/4P3/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Again at first I wasn't sure white moved here.  But Jack said that this move is actually quite good.  She is now placing a lot of pressure on black in pretty much all directions.  In fact JP is becoming quite aggressive and should win with best play although it's difficult to say what'll happen since none of them have made any mistakes yet.  What we do know however is that Judit is playing extremely well.
945,28,15,1a5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nqppp/3p4/p1n1pPP1/4P3/1BN2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This time however this move did not get discussed.  Having said that I do not know why Szendrei made this move.
946,28,16,1Nd5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nqppp/3p4/p1nNpPP1/4P3/1B3Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This move I understand perfectly well and know where white is going for.  She's attacking black's Q and then some.  After retreating black is going to have some problems.
947,28,17,1Qd8,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1n1ppp/3p4/p1nNpPP1/4P3/1B3Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Also feasible was 15...Qe8 but for some reason I like this move better.  And this is something that I also would have played if I were black.
948,28,18,1Rg1,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1n1ppp/3p4/p1nNpPP1/4P3/1B3Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',"The idea here is to put pressure on the g file and expose black's K here soon within a few moves as is about to happen.  It took me a while but now I completely understand what my coach means when he says that ""She's getting really nasty.""  Afterall he also tells me that I'm getting really nasty when it comes to the same issue King exposure."
949,28,19,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/3n1ppp/1p1p4/p1nNpPP1/4P3/1B3Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',"? I don't know why black made this choice but in my opinion this is his first mistake.  This is one of the few times where better was 16...g6 to prevent what is about to come.  Now why do I say this?  In general it's not a good idea to put a whole around your K unless you're giving it ""air to breath"" in order to prevent a back rank mate.  That's because putting a whole around it usually leaves it vulnerable to exposure.  While we aren't talking about back rank mates this time putting a whole around it is the way to prevent exposure paradoxically.  We're talking about some danger should white decide to play something like g6.  As it turns out she won't but something similar which poses the same kind of thread is about to occur so be ready."
950,28,20,1Rg4,b'r1bq1rk1/3n1ppp/1p1p4/p1nNpPP1/4P1R1/1B3Q2/PPP4P/R1B1K3 b Q -',However it's not this move and since we never talked about it in the chess club I don't know what this move accomplishes.  Afterall she's not going to play Rh4 or g6.  Instead an exchange is about to occur with black forcing the exchange.  What I'm saying is that she won't play what I just mentioned after the exchange.
951,28,21,Nc5,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1p1p4/p1nNpPP1/4P1R1/1P3Q2/1PP4P/R1B1K3 w Q -',!? I do not know why Szendri moved here.  What I do know however is that no matter what black did not have a good reason for playing this.  That's because Jack told me that he didn't know the reason behind this either but it's not the best move.  So at the very least this is an inaccuracy and possibly even a mistake.  In fact it's quite dangerous and best was 18...f6 because of what's about to come.  That's why I'm emphasizing this as a !? choice. 
952,28,22,1Nf6+,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/1p1p1N2/p1n1pPP1/4P1R1/1P3Q2/1PP4P/R1B1K3 b Q -',And this move proves that 18...Nc5!?  But what's going to happen from here?  Well things are going to get very interesting.
953,28,23,1gxf6,b'r1bq1rk1/5p1p/1p1p1p2/p1n1pPP1/4P1R1/1P3Q2/1PP4P/R1B1K3 w Q -',"?? This move looks very good because you'd think hmm at the very least black just won a piece for a pawn.  Well that's just too easy.  According to my coach this is a losing blunder.  But I had to evaluate for myself by looking at the entire board since easy19 emphasizes to ""be a spectator of your own game.""  So after analyzing this position I realize that Jack is spot on.  This move loses right away.   Therefore best was 19...Kh8 and this is what Szendrei really needed to play.  Now there's more to this story then meets the eye and I will cover them in the end."
954,28,24,Kh8,b'r1bq1r1k/5p1p/1p1p1P2/p1n1pP2/4P1R1/1P3Q2/1PP4P/R1B1K3 w Q -',Now he plays what would have been best on move 19 as noted earlier.  However it's too little too late.
955,28,25,2Qh3,b'r1bq1r1k/5p1p/1p1p1P2/p1n1pP2/4P1R1/1P5Q/1PP4P/R1B1K3 b Q -',"At this point black resigned.  At first I wanted to know why as resignation seemed premature.  However the coach told me why and that it wasn't so.  In that he accurately implied that white now has an unavoidable mating pattern.  First he directly stated that white immediately starts with Rg7.  After that I saw exactly what would have happened.  It turns out that this pattern involves a mating net because JP would use her Q to deliver a mate right away.  Therefore it proves something important as noted earlier.  So there are several morals to this game.  What are they?  First it's based on something that archduke_piccalo mentioned in a previous annotation.  In this case what might have been good 8 moves earlier is now a very serious blunder.  In that he implied that what sometimes would have been good earlier becomes bad later on.  Second I learned from one of my favorite mentors here on GK that what looks good might be bad as I noted in a different annotation.  This is the very reason that why is the most common.  So like is a move good or does it just appear.  What actually makes it good or weak.  Why or why not.  Finally ""to take is a mistake"" as also noted from a completely different annotation.  As therealjimfriar pointed out "" always look a gift horse in the mouth. If any good player gives anything away then there is a reason.""  That's the case here.  It looked like Judit Polgar blundered away a N.  But it turns out that she made a reasonable sac.  And it was also a trap which her opponent fell into by taking that piece.  Now had black however saw what was really going and played 19...Kh8 he would have had a chance to stay in the game because despite one or two flaws he played extremely well. "
956,29,0,Nh5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/3bp2p/3pN2n/3P1B1P/8/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Good. I had to choose among the knight on d2 or the pawn on e3. Both are on the agenda anyway but the order allowed this. Now the normal move Bh2 is questionable due to Qxh4.

1112,35,0,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Most people go for more space when playing against the King's Indian Attack but my opponent vies for solidity instead. This is a reasonable choice and usually ensures games that are more closely fought and subtle.

1132,35,20,3Nh6+,b'5rk1/1n3qp1/2R2pQN/pp2p3/4P3/1P5P/P1P2KB1/8 b - -',Though my opponent played well throughout most of the game his defense to my kingside attack was inaccurate and allowed tactics to flourish. Also to note is the speed of plans: black lost a tempo with a bishop retreat and chose to attack my center too late or did not pressure me enough on the queenside. 
1133,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The first move is 1. e4. I take control of the centre (d5- and f5-squares) and at the same time open diagonals for the bishop at f1 and the queen at d1.
1134,36,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays an opening called Caro-Kann. The idea is to play a pawn to d5 next when it is supported by the c6 pawn. This challenges the control of the center.
1135,36,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I play the most common move: d4. This move takes control of more central squares (e5 and c5) and opens a diagonal for the bishop at c1.
1136,36,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move is a surprise to me. Black does not follow the usual plan but intends to put his bishop on g7 (or h6). This is called a fianchetto. It is possible that Black transposes to another opening via this move order.
1137,36,4,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Here I had several alternative moves. I could have developed a piece. My knights and bishops are ready to move. But because Black has not yet challenged the centre I want to make it as difficult as possible for Black to play d5. Move c4 achieves this. In addition the knight at b1 stands better behind the c-pawn than in front of it.
1138,36,5,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/2p2pp1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"In my opinion this is a positional mistake. It weakens the king's protection and does not serve any good purpose. Perhaps Black tries to play a pawn to e5 and wants to protect the pawn. But in general protecting the e5-pawn with f6 is bad. The e8-h5 diagonal becomes weak. Now because of the pawn on g6 it cannot be utilized but later it can be a problem for Black.

P.S. The computer agrees with me that this is a mistake. 3...d5 was actually possible here."
1139,36,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/2p2pp1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I start developing the pieces. I want to find good squares for all my pieces so that they play well together and don't step on each others toes. The knight is easy to put here because it controls the central squares e4 and d5.
1140,36,7,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So Black opens the diagonal for the light-squared bishop and possibly prepares e5.
1141,36,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue development. Here the knight controls the d4- and e5-squares.
1142,36,9,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black decides to develop the bishop and simultaneously pin my knight against my queen. The pin inderectly weakens my control of the d4- and e5-squares because my knight cannot take on those squares without losing the queen. I expect that Black wants to play e5 challenging the center and freeing squares for the pieces.
1143,36,10,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I develop my bishop and break the pin. Now it is also possible to castle kingside.

Although it decreases my central control it is bad for two reasons: it loses the bishop pair and it loses tempos. This might require an explanation. With the bishop pair I mean that having two bishops on the board is better than having a bishop and a knight or two knights. This is something that a beginner might not know. And by losing tempos I mean that Black trades a piece that has moved twice for a piece that has moved only once.
1145,36,12,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I capture with the bishop. I briefly thought about capturing with the g-pawn although it would shatter the pawn structure because the e4-pawn would get a supporting pawn on f3. However I decided to keep the pawn structure intact which makes the king feel safer if it castled kingside. Look at the board now. I have two pieces developed the king is one move away from castling and I control the center. Black has no pieces developed the king is far from castling and the central control is modest.
1146,36,13,Qa5,b'rn2kbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black brings the queen out. This temporarily pins my remaining knight against the king. While this is not such as bad move it does not help Black's development. Usually it is wise to move knights and bishops first.
1147,36,14,O-O,b'rn2kbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle. The king is safer now and there is no pin anymore.
1148,36,15,Bh6,b'rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1ppb/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black develops the dark-squared bishop and offers to exchange it with my bishop.
1149,36,16,Qd3,b'rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1ppb/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I do not want to take on h6 because it helps Black to develop the knight. Moving the bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal seems less effective because Black can trade it off. I find another useful move. The queen moves away from the back rank so the rooks are free to move wherever they are needed. I also plan to take the d-file in my control after the center opens up.
1150,36,17,Bxc1,b'rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1b2RK1 w kq -',And Black trades off the bishop. I think that keeping the tension would have been better.

I think I must act now before Black's king finds a safe place. So what are the possible plans? Breaking the center with e5 would open files. But what if Black plays 0-0-0? I do not like Black's rook on the d-file then. So the first thing I do is prevent the queenside castling."
1153,36,20,1Bg4,b'r3k1nr/pp2p2p/n1pp1pp1/q7/2PPP1B1/2NQ4/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b kq -',This move takes the c8-square in control. In addition I might play Qh3 later which threatens Bd7+ after which Black cannot castle.

The only way to prevent the check is play Nb8 which retreats the knight to its starting square. Black might also try to get to an endgame by playing something like 12...Nh6 13.

P.S. Instead of this move the computer suggest 12...f5!? I thought it would lose a pawn after 13. exf5 gxf5 14. Bxf5 but Black has the option to play 13...Nf6! and recapture the pawn after the bishop has retreated or traded off with the knight."

So what did we learn? At least that developing pieces is important. In the final position Black's rooks and the other knight have not even moved. Another lesson is that you should be aware of your opponents threats. Black simply kept capturing pawns when the king was in danger.

I learned that I should calculate variations more carefully even in simple positions because I missed a few lines that would have allowed Black to defend. I also made a simple mistake with move order in moves 14 and 15. Sometimes the moves work better in another order that I though initially."

1233,39,31,2Be3,b'3rqrk1/2p3p1/p1npb3/1p2p1Pp/2PbN3/1PNQBP2/P5BK/1R3R2 b - -',[?!] Instead GK recommends 21.Bh3 Bxh3  22.Kxh3 Qe6ch  23.Kh2 Nb4  24.Qe2 d5!?  25.cxd5 Nxd5  26.Nxd5  leaves White favorably placed whether Black plays 26...Rxd5 or ...Bxa1.  Together with cxb6 and Nf6ch?! White's defensive resources seem abundant.

1236,39,34,2Rf2,b'3rqrk1/2p3p1/p1np4/4p1Pp/2b1N3/2N1QP2/P4RBK/1R6 b - -',[?] A mistake overlooking Black's reply after which Black is in the ascendant.  Instead 25.Rfc1 d5  26.Qc5 or 25...Nd4  26.Nd2 Be6  27.Nce4 are OK for White.  
1237,39,35,2d5,b'3rqrk1/2p3p1/p1n5/3pp1Pp/2b1N3/2N1QP2/P4RBK/1R6 w - -',[!] This will win back the piece Black sacrificed ... on move 11!

1239,39,37,2d4,b'3rqrk1/2p3p1/p1n5/4p1Pp/2bp4/2N1QP2/P2N1RBK/1R6 w - -',Fork.

1241,39,39,2Qxb1,b'3rqrk1/2p3p1/p1n5/4p1Pp/3pN3/5P2/P2N1RBK/1Q6 b - -',Black has R and 3 vs B and N instead of the 3 extra pawns he could have had after dxc3.

1243,39,41,Rb6,b'4qrk1/2p3p1/prn5/4p1Pp/3pN3/3Q1P2/P2N1RBK/8 w - -',Consolidating on the Q-side.  Sensible option.  It often happens that winning material has a disruptive disorganising effect that  requires being seen to before going over to attack.
1244,39,42,3f4,b'5rk1/2p2qp1/prn5/2N1p1Pp/3p1P2/3Q4/P2N1RBK/8 b - -',Intending after ...exf44 to play Rf2-e2-e6 and win the Knight on c6.  However after 32...exf4  33.Re2 Nb4 Black would have kept his lead:  34.Qxd4 Nc2  35.Qd7 Ne3 -(Not 35...Qxd7??)- 36.Qxf7ch Rxf7.  There would be just too many Black pawns running about...
1245,39,43,3Nb4,b'5rk1/2p2qp1/pr6/2N1p1Pp/1n1p1P2/3Q4/P2N1RBK/8 w - -',[?]  Omitting ...exf4 allows White to regain some lost ground.
1246,39,44,3Qh3,b'5rk1/2p2qp1/pr6/2N1p1Pp/1n1p1P2/7Q/P2N1RBK/8 b - -',[?!]  Exchanging Queens by 33.Qc4 seems more likely to yield the draw.  Presumably White has 34.Nd7 in mind attacking both rooks.
1247,39,45,3Rd8,b'3r2k1/2p2qp1/pr6/2N1p1Pp/1n1p1P2/7Q/P2N1RBK/8 w - -',That ends White's threat.  But GK recommends 33...Rg6 threatening ...Rxg5 as more effective.

1249,39,47,3g6,b'3r2k1/2p2qp1/pr4P1/2N4p/1n1pBp2/7Q/P2N1R1K/8 b - -',The point.  The h-pawn is cut off from all help and must fall.  Though localised White's subsequent attack down the h-file is quite strong.

This also ties the rook down to defending the d2-knight.  But this is a mistake that brings White back to at least level terms.  Instead 35...Rxg6!  36.Bxg6 Qxg6  37.Ne6 Re8  38.Nxc7 Nd3 leading to a ending with  N vs 3P that looks promising for Black.  
1251,39,49,3Qxh5,b'3r2k1/2p3p1/pr4P1/2N4Q/1n1pBp2/8/q2N1R1K/8 b - -',White's attack looks pretty strong.  Black may have his work cut out to hold...
1252,39,50,3Rf6,b'3r2k1/2p3p1/p4rP1/2N4Q/1n1pBp2/8/q2N1R1K/8 w - -',[?] Interestingly enough in the previous move's analysis GK gave this as OK.  Now it reverses its view.  A clear instance of what the 'horizon effect' can mean.  Black's best defence seems to be 36...Nd5 though White can then play 37.Qh7ch kf8  38.Qh8ch Ke7  39.Qxg7ch Kd6  40.Bf5!! ... The threat is 41.Nde4ch winning the Queen and of course 40...Kxc5  41.Ne4ch won't change that.  Absent a safe square for the Queen Black must succumb: [A] 40...Qa1?  41.Nde4ch Kc6  42.Bd7ch Rxd7  43.Qxd7#; or 40...Kc6 41.Bd7ch and one way or another Black's Q will fall.
1253,39,51,3Qh7+,b'3r2k1/2p3pQ/p4rP1/2N5/1n1pBp2/8/q2N1R1K/8 b - -',[?!] A good move played too soon equals a bad move - or at least not the best.  White rushes his attack!  However it must be acknowledged that the right move is not so easy to find: 37.Re2!  the threat is this: 38.Nd7!! Rxd7  39.Bxd5ch!! Qxd5  40.Re8ch Rf8  41.Qh7#.  A possible defence is 37...Kf8 but then comes 38.Bf5! Qg8  39.Nd7ch Rxd7  40.Bxd7 Rxg6  41.Qxg6 and there will be no escaping the mating net.  In this line 39.Be6 also wins but not so quickly.
1254,39,52,3Kf8,b'3r1k2/2p3pQ/p4rP1/2N5/1n1pBp2/8/q2N1R1K/8 w - -',Forced of course...

Had he seen it betimes he might have tried cutting off the Queen altogether from the defence of the King: 38.Ncb3! Rdd6  39.Qh8ch Ke7  40.Qxg7ch Kd8  41.Qg8ch! Ke7 42.Qh7ch Kd8  43.g7 with a decisive edge: 43...Rh6ch  44.Kg1! Rxh7  45.g8=Qch Kd7   46.Qxh7ch Kd8  47.Rxf4 and wins.  Of course this is going really deep into the position but even just two or three moves in it is clear that Black is in a bad way.
1256,39,54,3Qg8,b'3r1kqQ/2p3p1/p4rP1/2N5/1n1pBp2/8/3N1R1K/8 w - -',The saving resource!  White's attack is almost completely thrown back...

For instance: 39.Qh3 Nd5 (say)  40.Nd7ch Ke7  41.Bxd5! Qxd5  42.Nxf6 Kxf6  43.Rxf4ch and even with the scanty material remaining White still has significant winning chances.  Instead White was eyeing the exchange on f4.
1258,39,56,3Rdd6,b'5kq1/2p3p1/p2r1rP1/2N5/1n1pBp1Q/8/3N1R1K/8 w - -',Instead ...Nd5 would have cut across White's next...
1259,39,57,Nd5,b'5kq1/2p3p1/p2r1rP1/2Nn4/3pBR1Q/8/3N3K/8 w - -',Probably better than 40...Rxf4 41.Qxf4.  Black is starting to consolidate once more.
1260,39,58,Qxd5,b'5k2/2p3p1/p2r1rP1/2Nq4/3p1R1Q/8/3N3K/8 w - -',After this has White any more attack?
1261,39,59,4Qh8+,b'5k1Q/2p3p1/p2r1rP1/2Nq4/3p1R2/8/3N3K/8 b - -',[??] I am quite at a loss to explain this.  For the second time this check leads where the it did the first time: nowhere.  The thing is this check has a powerful potential - it just needs to be timed correctly as earlier analysis has indicated.  Instead 42.Rxf6ch!  Rxf6??  43.Qh8ch! Qg8  44.Nd7ch would have been lethal.  Black would have had to play 42....gxf6 and even then 43.Nde4 would have kept Black on the defensive:  43...Qa2ch  44.Kh3 Qa3ch  45.Ng3 Qxc5  46.g7. 
1262,39,60,4Rxf6+,b'5kqQ/2p3p1/p2r1RP1/2N5/3p4/8/3N3K/8 b - -',[?] Instead White could have tried again with 43.Qh4 and probably have had enough to secure the draw.  After this the advantage changes hands once more...
1263,39,61,4g7+,b'5kqQ/2p3P1/p2r1p2/2N5/3p4/8/3N3K/8 b - -',There's nothing better yet can this possibly lead anywhere?
1264,39,62,4Kf7,b'6qQ/2p2kP1/p2r1p2/2N5/3p4/8/3N3K/8 w - -',Now White's sole remaining pawn is a goner.
1265,39,63,4Nd7,b'6qQ/2pN1kP1/pr3p2/8/3pN3/8/7K/8 b - -',Maybe 46.Qh5ch kept White at least fighting on: 46...Kxg7  47.Ng3 Rb2ch  (GK though I'd probably go for 47...Qh7 forcing off the Queens).
1266,39,64,Kxg7,b'8/2pN2k1/p4p2/8/3pN3/6K1/1r6/8 w - -',Two knights versus rook and four: steep odds...
1267,39,65,4Nexf6,b'8/2pN2k1/p4N2/8/3p4/6K1/1r6/8 b - -',[?] Hastens the end but really White hasn't had the ghost of a chance since his 43rd move.
1268,39,66,Rb3,b'8/2pN2k1/p7/8/8/1r2N1K1/3p4/8 w - -',[0-1] Nothing will stop the d-pawn now. White resigned.   An engrossing game with all sorts of chances for both sides.  To be fair to White the strong attack he developed late in the game was enormously complicated and not all easy to determine the best way to carry on.  Check out the Qh8ch moves as played and in the analysis.  Sometimes it was an excellent move occasionally so-so and at other times it was a bad move.  It was the sort of game in which you could expect the odd inaccuracy even at the highest levels  Well done both players!
