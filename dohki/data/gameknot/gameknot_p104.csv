I think the point with this move order is that if white goes for the set up the black LSB may prove to be more useful on the c8-h3 diagonal.

42,2,5,Qa5,b'r4rk1/3nppbp/b2p2p1/q1pP4/6n1/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Sometimes I come to b6 but this is a more common square for my queen and I figured I should probably aim to stay within established norms.

Getting in this pawn advance is one of blacks key ideas in this opening usually it's purpose involves getting a knight to the d3 which isn't the case here since white has still not moved the e pawn. However this advance often has dynamic purposes and sometimes aims to free the c5 square for the pieces. I couldn't help but feeling this was too soon but every line I looked at seemed promising so I just played it. The purpose is to get the queen to c5 which hits f2 and by initiating contact between the pawns I'm sure to induce a weakness also I'm now hitting d5

I also could have exchanged bishops now with ...Nd2 but the exchange would only have favoured white this is a better move.

I hope you all enjoyed that Part 1 Cameo now it is time for Part 2.  This time my opponent is currently a Class C player who also had the misfortune to get on the wrong side of Glenda.  How did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis version of this game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18378837&fb=1&rnd=0.9658788367717621"
65,3,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',2. d4 - this is the Centre Game.  White makes an immediate d4 thrust following e4.  Both bishop's diagonals are now clear.  I decided to capture and the Wicked Witch of the West recaptures.  This centralisation of the enemy queen is a double edged sword.  Can I give her the runaround?  We shall see.

I then told him it was up to him but he would have to give up his queen for my knight to prevent immediate checkmate.  He resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material but Gameknot Analysis told me that I did in fact have a forced mate in 9.  But again do you think it is wise to underestimate Glenda?  Well you may have another think coming because her next victim is currently a Class C player and formerly a Class B player with an optimum rating of 1730.  That is up next folks .......

99,5,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A good developing move.  Equally good is 3...Nf6: the Four Knights Opening if White plays 4.Bb5; the Giuoco Pianissimo or Two Knight's defence if 4.Bc4.  Here White can transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo if she plays 4.Bc4...

White could be aiming for an eventual strike at the bishop on c5 but whilst preparing this Black can make better use of her time.  I've given the move a 'dubious' mark (?!) rather than a 'mistake' (?) as it is playable enough and doesn't seriously compromise White's game.

It might be objected though that as the situation stands White can pick up Black's e-pawn into the bargain.  That is certainly what White thought...

There were two ways Black could have gone about visiting his retribution upon White: [A]: 7...Re8!?  8.f4 ... and now comes the really juicy bit: 8... Nxe4!! 9.Nxe4 Rxe5!!  10.fxe5 ... Black is a whole rook down for what?  This is for what:  10...Qh4ch (Everyone has seen this sort of attack before!)  11.Kf1 (11.Ng3 Bg4!) ...Qxe4  12.Qe2 Qxc2.  At this point though still the exchange down Black's superior mobility should ensure that he keeps White bailed up for a long time to come.  But that isn't even the best line!  Try this [B]:  7...Qd4!  This move attacks the Knight at e5 and the f2-square (...Qxf2#) simultaneously.  How can White defend?  There is but one way to save both: 8.Nd3! Nxe4  9.Ne2! Qf6!  10.f3! ... This weakening move is just about forced so heavy is the pressure against f2; 10...Qh4ch  11.Kf1 Rd8 (Threatening to take out the remaining defence of f2)  12.Qe1 Qf6  13.Nxc5 Nxc5.  At this point although White has successfully repulsed Black's heavy attack Black has got his pawn back and retains the more mobile position.  Exciting stuff eh?
106,5,8,Qf3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b1N3/4P3/P1N2Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',[8.Qf3!?]  Probably OK though if for any reason the e5-Knight has to retreat d3 is where it will have to go.  That's safe enough but could be inconvenient if White wants to advance her d-pawn and develop her Queen's Bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.
107,5,9,Qd4,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b1N3/3qP3/P1N2Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',A move too late but it still forces the knight back to the unhandy square d3.

Unhandy as the d3-square is for the Knight standing on it Black ought to have deprived White of a cheap means of rectifying the situation.  White could now have played 10.Nxc5 Qxc5  11.d3 (rubbing it in) with a fine game having kept hold of her stolen pawn.   So a better move than the text would have been 9...Bb6.
109,5,11,1e5,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b1P3/3q4/P1NN1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',[e5?!]  Much better was 10.Nxc5!  Although after 10.e5 Nd7  11.Nxc5 Qxc5 White sorts out the situation on the d-file Black will be able to win back the e-pawn and re-establish material equality with about a level game.
110,5,12,1Ng4,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/2b1P3/3q2n1/P1NN1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Going after the e-pawn and with an eye on f2 as well.  But now 11.Ne2 followed by 12.h3 would have forced the Black queen and knight away and left white with a perfectly tenable game.
111,5,13,1Ne4,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/2b1P3/3qN1n1/P2N1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',[11.Ne4?!]  Plausible looking but Black now picks up the e-pawn with extreme prejudice...

Quite why White thought she could get away with Black playing 12...Nxf3ch I can't imagine.  But even after White's best try 12.Nxe5 Black would have come out with the better chances: 12.Nxe5 Qxe5 (it appears that 12...Bd5! would have been equally strong) 13.0-0 Bd5.  The pin against the Knight at e4 would have been a real bone in the throat for White.
114,5,16,1Bg4,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p5/2N1n3/3q2b1/P2N1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',[..Bg4??]  An unnecessary finesse shall we say?  Instead 12...Nxf3ch (this would have been good even without the 'check')  13.gxf3 Bd5 and Black would have been comfortably ahead a Queen for two Knights.

Instead of this 13.Qg3 would have kept White in the game and better yet 13.Qe3 would have put White on top!  Here's the plot:  13.Qe3!! Nxd3ch  14.cxd3!! ... (This is the key to White's defence.  She can now hold out) 14...Rfe8  15.Ne4 f5 (The raging attack is still coming in but White can now step out from behind her shield wall with an infantry advance on the right flank:)  16.h3! Bh4  17.g4 fxe4  (17...Bg6  18.gxf5 and the pin at e4 loses most of its effect)  18.Qxd4 Rxd4  19.gxh5 exd3ch 20.Kf1.  Under siege for so long White emerges ahead a Bishop for 2 Pawns.  Once she mobilizes her reserves Black will have a fight on his hands simply to hold a draw.

118,5,20,1Rfe8,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/2N1q3/6b1/P3Q3/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This move was probably the best Black had threatening to recover his lost piece by 15...Qxc5 or else place further shackles upon the White Queen half-pinned at e3.  But White can escape this with one simple developing move...
119,5,21,1Nd3,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/4q3/6b1/P2NQ3/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',[15.Nd3??]  This isn't it.  Instead 15.0-0! would have broken the pin after which White kept her extra material and her advantage.
120,5,22,1Qe6,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p1q3/8/6b1/P2NQ3/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',[15...Qe6?]  Black must have forgotten that had the Queen moved off the e-file the Rook standing at e8 maintained the pin whereat Black won Queen for Rook and hence entered a favourable endgame with a Queen versus Rook and Knight.  Once more White has been given the chance to castle out of the pin.  Mind you things have become more complicated by now as will be seen.  Suffice to say that almost any Queen move off the  e-file would have given Black fine winning chances. 
121,5,23,1Qxe6,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p1Q3/8/6b1/P2N4/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',[16.Qxe6??] Essential was 16.0-0.  However things have become much more complicated and even 16.0-0 wasn't quite a 'gimme' escape: 16.0-0 Qd6  17.Qg3 (say) Be2!  18.Qxd6 cxd6 (undoubling pawns and depriving the White Knight of 5th rank squares).  But now what should White play?  If she tries to save her rook this happens: 19.Re1 Bxd3!  and the bishop can not be taken - now or after 20.Rxe8 Rxe8 - on account of the back rank mate!  So White would have to be content with 21.Nf4! Bxf1  22.Kxf1 ... and an endgame with two minor pieces versus a rook.  Such an ending would have been very favourable for White but technically difficult for both sides.
122,5,24,1Bxe6,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/8/8/P2N4/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',[16...Bxe6?!]  Given the obviousness of 16...Rxe6ch this move is very hard to comprehend.  Once again White is let off the hook whilst Black hangs himself out to dry.  After 16...Rxe6ch Black would have won easily:  17.Kf1 Be2ch  and now [A] 18.Ke1 Bxd3ch  19.Kd1 Be2ch  20.Ke1 Bg4ch!  21.Kf1 Rde8 and faced with mate White must lose material: 22.f3 Re1ch  23.Kf2 Rxh1; or [B]  18.Kg1 Bxd3  19.h3 Bxc2 and although Black emerges with the single extra pawn so huge is his edge in mobility that White will have to offer up more material just so she can move a piece.
123,5,25,1O-O,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/8/8/P2N4/1PPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Breaking at last Black's attack down the e-file.  This move is fine but White could just about have dared Black to do his worst: 17.f3 ...(say with the view to moving the King to f2)  17...Bb3ch (the only discovered check that is of any use to Black now)  18.Kd1! Rxd3!  19.cxb3 Rxb3.  Black would have remained a piece down and he would not have been able indefinitely to maintain his bind on White's position.  Once mobilized White's extra minor piece would have been decisive.
124,5,26,1Bf5,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/5b2/8/P2N4/1PPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Slightly better might have been 17...Bc4 with much the same idea in mind but placing a pin on the Knight.  Pins have been a bit of a feature of this game.
125,5,27,1Nb4,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2p5/5b2/1N6/P7/1PPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I think I would have been tempted to play 18.Ne1 here with the idea 19.d3 and develop the bishop to e3 and the Knight to f3.
126,5,28,1Na2,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p2b2/8/P7/NPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',It was this or back to d3.  The problem with the latter is that Black wins a pawn from the resulting exchange and White finds it difficult to mobilize her pieces.  I'd still fancy White's chances but it would take very patient play to establish a supremacy and make progress.
127,5,29,1Re2,b'3r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p2b2/8/P7/NPPPrPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The obvious 19.Bxc2 would have been fine.  Black could not have maintained his rook on the seventh rank after 20.Nc3!
128,5,30,2c3,b'3r2k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p2b2/8/P1P5/NP1PrPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Good enough but 20.Nc3 would have chased Black rook away after which 21.d3 would have seen White rapidly mobilizing her uncommitted reserves.
129,5,31,2Rde8,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p2b2/8/P1P5/NP1PrPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black might have been better advised to keep the clamps on as much as he could by 20...c4 or ...Bd3.  Now White could have broken out by 21.d4! with the idea 21...cxd4 22.cxd4 Bd3  23.Be3 Rxb2  24.Rfd1  Bc4  25.Nc3 and White is gradually crawling out of the box; or 21...Bd3  22.Bg5 Rxb2  23.Rfe1 Rxe1ch  24.Rxe1 f6  25.Nc1 Bf5  26.Bf4 and Black has only two pawns for a Knight in the endgame.
130,5,32,Bd3,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p5/8/P1Pb1P2/NP1Pr1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',[21...Bd3!]  Fine move.  Black is making the best of the chance he's been given here and reimposes a bind on White's centre and Queen side.  A piece ahead in the endgame White is finding it hard to come up with a plan to free her game and to assert her material advantage.  
131,5,33,2b4,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/2p5/1P6/P1Pb1P2/N2Pr1PP/R1B2RK1 b - b3',A spirited try...
132,5,34,2c4,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/1Pp5/P1Pb1P2/N2Pr1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I quite like the thinking behind this move but it might have allowed White once more to find a way to free her game after 23.h3!  Instead Black could have forced White seriously to consider accepting a draw by playing 22...R2e6!  23.Rd1 Bc2!  24.Rf1 Bd3  25.Rd1 etc.  The only way White could have broken the deadlock would have been by offering the exchange:  23.Bb2 Bxf1  24.Kxf1 c4 and even then any winning chances remaining to her would have been at best problematical.
133,5,35,2Bb2,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/1Pp5/P1Pb1P2/NB1Pr1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Hoping to break out.  But 23.h3  would have stymied Black's scheme of 23...R2e6  24.Rf2 Re1ch  25.Kh2.  Now Black wins the exchange and brings the material situation to near equality.
134,5,36,2Bc1,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/1Pp5/P1Pb1P2/N2r2PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Suddenly White is in serious difficulty.  It looks all right superficially: threatened with the loss of the exchange White has a counter-threat and if the d2-Rook moves the bishop has at last obtained an open diagonal for itself.  That was no doubt the idea behind her last two or three moves and if so the plan deserved a better fate.    The problem though is the 2nd rank and the enemy rook's occupation of it.
135,5,37,2Rc2,b'4r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/1Pp5/P1Pb1P2/N1r3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',[24...Rc2!]  Excellent.  Absolutely the right move: now both Black rooks will establish themselves upon White's 2nd rank.  This is well worth a whole minor piece.

There is no mate the Black bishop is under attack - Black might have had to drop into an unfavourable endgame by 28...Ref2  29.Rxf2 Rxf2  30.Nxd3 cxd3  31.Rd1 Rxf3  32.Bxc7...

Having found the move not only to stop the mate but to turn the tables as well and with just 2 legal moves available White finds exactly the wrong one.  30.Bxh2 would have won outright as Black would have had no option (owing to the threat of a 'back rank' mate) but to play 30...Rxe1  31.Rxe1 and go a Rook and minor piece behind.

363,13,3,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3n4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White wisely looks to keep the King safe and develop.
364,13,4,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3n4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Further protects the Knight to free up the Queen and blocks the e-file to the King.
365,13,5,Qxd5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3q4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Bishop takes wouldn't have gained anything - the Queen is safe to come out and then duck behind to defend the extra pawn.
366,13,6,d4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/5q2/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq d3',White's gained the fair share of the center threatening d5.
367,13,7,c6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/5q2/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I figured this was the way to get a grip on d5... but I was wrong. I'm open to any ideas here.
368,13,8,cxd5,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/4b3/3p1q2/5p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',A mistake - allowing Nb5 with multiple threats. Better was Bc4 first and then to take to allow a quick castling to take the sting out of how the game continues.
369,13,9,1Nb5,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/4b3/1N1p1q2/5p2/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',A great move by my opponent threatening forks on c7 and d6. It took me quite a few minutes to find a way out without losing a rook but at the cost of a fool knight.

375,13,15,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pp3ppp/n3q3/1Nbp4/5B2/2P5/PP4PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',I wasn't too sure what to play here so figured I may as well look to grab the semi-open c-file. I wasn't sure whether the other rook should be on the e-file or d-file.
376,13,16,Qe4,b'2r2rk1/pp3ppp/n7/2bp4/3NqB2/2P5/PP4PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Trading would have just helped him bring the queen out and connect the rooks. I felt e4 was a nicely active square for the Queen where she couldn't easily be dislodged (for example if Re1 then Qxf4) without perhaps a trade (and the trade of knight for bishop now works better for Black).
377,13,17,1Nb3,b'2r2rk1/pp3ppp/n7/2bp4/4qB2/1NP5/PP4PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Looking to exchange off the bishop or perhaps reroute through d2 to kick the Queen.

379,13,19,Rfe8,b'2r1r1k1/p4ppp/np6/2bp4/4qB2/1NP5/PP1Q2PP/R4R1K w - -',White has now connected the rooks and Black will contest the e-file.
380,13,20,Qc4,b'2r1r1k1/p4ppp/np6/2bp4/2q2B2/1NP5/PP1Q2PP/4RR1K w - -',Necessary to continue to protect the weak pawn (the slight advantage Black has).
381,13,21,Rcd8,b'3rr1k1/p4ppp/np6/2bp4/2q2B2/1NP2R2/PP1Q2PP/4R2K w - -',I decided that the d-file was a better file for the rook - to better support the isolani and free the Queen. Looking back I believe 16...Rad8 was better.
382,13,22,2Be5,b'3rr1k1/p4ppp/np6/2bpB3/2q5/1NP2R2/PP1Q2PP/4R2K b - -',His Rf3 move suddenly became clearer - to build a threat at g7.
383,13,23,2f6,b'3rr1k1/p5pp/np3p2/2bpB3/2q5/1NP2R2/PP1Q2PP/4R2K w - -',There are no alternatives I can see - g6 would have critically weakened the dark squares with a dark-squared bishop and queen on the board Bd6 just hangs the bishop or mate.
384,13,24,2Bxf6,b'3rr1k1/p5pp/np3B2/2bp4/2q5/1NP2R2/PP1Q2PP/4R2K b - -',And this I think is where White loses the game - looking for the bishop sac to tear open the kingside. A very enterprising idea but it just didn't have the necessary followup this time.
385,13,25,2Rxf6,b'3rr1k1/p6p/np3R2/2bp4/2q5/1NP5/PP1Q2PP/4R2K b - -',The King is exposed at the cost of a bishop for a pawn.
386,13,26,2Rxe1+,b'3r2k1/p6p/np3R2/2bp4/2q5/1NP5/PP1Q2PP/4r2K w - -',However White's firepower can be drastically reduced through trading off.
387,13,27,Qe4,b'3r2k1/p6p/np3R2/2bp4/4q3/1NP5/PP4PP/4Q2K w - -',Looking to trade Queen's with a potential mating threat on b1.
388,13,28,Kh8,b'3r3k/p6p/np3R2/2bp4/4q3/1NP3Q1/PP4PP/7K w - -',And here White resigned - the attack has fizzled with Black up a bishop for a pawn. I feel the resignation may have been a bit premature but he was definitely disadvantaged. 
389,14,0,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/8/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Moving twice the knight in the very opening... but after Qxd4 white has an easy developement kicking the queen.

She's at it again!  Things have a habit of coming in threes don't they?  Well on that Saturday they certainly did.  My opponent this time was dmaestro who beat me in that 60 mover where I lost against him because I chose to take off the wrong pawn.  If I had taken the central pawn instead of the side pawn I would have clawed back half a point off him but it wasn't to be.  On move 18 he just did not know what was gonna hit him.

Had another sparring match with The Dentist who is a former Class C Player (Optimum Rating 1407).  In this game I did not win copious amounts of material but I mounted a steady stealthy attack.  Funnily enough my precious queen Glenda known as The Defender played an almost pedestrian role until the very end of the game when she delivered the Coup De Grace.  So how did this happen?

In the main lines White looks to dominate through the center where Black looks to control b4 and make a later push to the e5/c5 squares. The threat of taking on c4 now carries more weight since it can be covered by b5 (which is in turn protected by c6) creating a strong dynamic queenside pawn mass.

While White looks to recapture Black will complete development. On the downside White will gain a stronger pawn center. Other common moves include 4...e6 to play the Semi-Slav (an entirely different beast) or the increasingly popular 4...a6 (a solid and flexible subvariation).

The plan will revolve around Be7 O-O a queenside fianchetto knight on either c6/d7 and fighting up the semi-open c-file.
773,29,8,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The only square that makes sense for the bishop which helps to support the central pawn mass and knight.
