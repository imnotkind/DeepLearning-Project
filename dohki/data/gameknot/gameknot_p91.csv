0,0,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Hey all; I'm taking a break from annotating these complex games so here's a quick lighter Blitz game to look at. Enjoy!
1,0,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a less-popular response to the English; it's normally used to transpose to something else like a Slav or Caro-Kann defense.
2,0,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Everyone is looking at d5.
3,0,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',White builds a strong center while Black prepares to make a pawn thrust to gain space of his own.
4,0,4,h5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p1pn2/7p/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq h6',? Well I didn't see this coming. Black would have been better off continuing with solid play with perhaps 4...Bb4.
5,0,5,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p1pn2/4P2p/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White takes advantage of the weak d6 square.
6,0,6,Nxf2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p1p3/4P2p/2PP4/2N4P/PP3nP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',?! Rather unusual but this is Blitz after all so bold-looking sacrifices are the order of the day sound or not.
7,0,7,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/2p1p3/4P2p/2PP4/2N4P/PP3KP1/R1BQ1BNR w kq -',There's really no way for this to accomplish anything.
8,0,8,h4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/2p1p3/4P3/2PP3p/2N2N1P/PP3KP1/R1BQ1B1R w kq -',Black sets up an outpost on the g3 hole.
9,0,9,Be2,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/2p1p3/4P3/2PP3p/2N2N1P/PP2BKP1/R1BQ3R b kq -',This move is intended almost exclusively to provide a space for White's Rook on f1. White is now also in a position to threaten moves like Bh5.
10,0,10,Na6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pbpp1/n1p1p3/4P3/2PP3p/2N2N1P/PP2BKP1/R1BQ3R w kq -',Black is having trouble coordinating his pieces thanks to his early pawn moves.
11,0,11,Nc5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pbpp1/2p1p3/2n1P3/2PP3p/2N2N1P/PP2BKP1/R1BQ1R2 w kq -',? Black has the idea of a tactic here to keep White from getting his King to g1 but with only two pieces developed (about to be only one!) he just doesn't have the firepower necessary to get compensation for this Knight especially since he sacrificed one piece for no compensation already!
12,0,12,1Qd2,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1pp1/1qp1p3/2b1P3/2P4p/2N1BN1P/PP1QBKP1/R4R2 b kq -',Black piles up on the Be3; White defends it. White now has his Rooks connected and a fully developed army whereas Black has... a Queen and Bishop and chances for one Rook on the opposite flank several moves down the road.
13,0,13,Qxb2,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1pp1/2p1p3/4P3/2P4p/2N1QN1P/Pq2BKP1/R4R2 w kq -',Black wins back a pawn but he is so far behind now that in a standard game he should surrender immediately. This is blitz though so errors are much more likely.
14,0,14,1Rb3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1pp1/2p1p3/4P3/2P4p/qRN1QN1P/P3BKP1/5R2 b kq -',White lifts his Rook with tempo in preparation for doubling on the b or f file.
15,0,15,1Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1pqpp1/2p1p3/4P3/2P4p/1RN1QN1P/P3BKP1/5R2 w kq -',White's pieces have all the energy and scope. Black's have almost none at all.
16,0,16,a5,b'r1b1k2r/1p1pqpp1/2p1p3/p3P3/2P4p/1RN1QN1P/P3B1P1/5RK1 w kq a6',? Accomplishes nothing.
17,0,17,exd5,b'r1b1k2r/1p2qpp1/2p5/p2pP3/P6p/1RN1QN1P/4B1P1/5RK1 w kq -',Black has finally given his LSB somewhere to go.
18,0,18,2Ng5,b'r1b1k2r/1p2qpp1/2p5/p2pP1N1/P6p/1RN1Q2P/4B1P1/5RK1 b kq -',White supports e6 and unleashes his Rook on the f-file.
19,0,19,2f6,b'r1b1k2r/1p2q1p1/2p2p2/p2pP1N1/P6p/1RN1Q2P/4B1P1/5RK1 w kq -',Black kicks the Knight.
20,0,20,2Nxd5,b'r1b1k2r/1p2q1p1/2p2p2/p2NP1N1/P6p/1R2Q2P/4B1P1/5RK1 b kq -',!? White gives back some material in exchange for pressing the attack.
21,0,21,2Bb5+,b'r1b1k2r/1p2q1p1/5p2/pB1pP1N1/P6p/1R2Q2P/6P1/5RK1 b kq -',This is the point of 21.Nxd5. Black's only choice is 22...Kf8 walking into the pin. Other options fail: 22...Bd7 23.Bxd7+ Qxd7 24.exf6+ etc. or 22...Kd8 23.Qb6+ Qc7 24.Nf7+ Ke7 25.Qxc7+.
22,0,22,2Qd4,b'r1b2k1r/1p2q1p1/5p2/pB1pP1N1/P2Q3p/1R5P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',White threatens Qxd5 or exf6.
23,0,23,2f5,b'r1b2k1r/1p2q1p1/8/pB1pPpN1/P2Q3p/1R5P/6P1/5RK1 w - -',Black hits the Knight in response.
24,0,24,2Ra3,b'r1b2k1r/1p2q1p1/8/pB1pPpN1/P2Q3p/R6P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',?? My finger slipped!
25,0,25,2e6,b'r1b2k1r/1p4p1/4P3/pB1p1pN1/P2Q3p/q6P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',Setting the Queen on g7 and cutting off the defense of f5.
26,0,26,2Ke7,b'r1b4r/1p2k1p1/4P3/pB1p1pN1/P2Q3p/q6P/6P1/5RK1 w - -',?? 25...Qe7 was necessary.
27,0,27,2Qxg7+,b'r1b4r/1p2k1Q1/4P3/pB1p1pN1/P6p/q6P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',Regaining the Rook.
28,0,28,Qg3,b'r1b4Q/1p6/3kP3/pB1p1pN1/P6p/6qP/6P1/5RK1 w - -',? The last mistake.
29,0,29,3e7,b'r1bQ4/1p2P3/8/pB1p1p2/P3k2p/5NqP/6P1/5RK1 b - -',The pawn cannot be stopped. There was probably a quicker forced mate but I wasn't going to try to find it under time pressure.
30,0,30,3Qe5#,b'1r1Q4/1p6/8/pB1pQp2/P4k1p/5NqP/6P1/5RK1 b - -',That's it! Thanks to my opponent for a spirited fight and thanks to anyone reading this for reading!
31,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hello and welcome to the next game in the Benoni Defense series between ptitroque and I. After being soundly drawn in the first game where I had the White pieces I'm on the lookout for similar traps this time around. I'll skim over the beginning since I've covered it before and because there's a lot to cover in this game.
32,1,1,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',All standard so far.
33,1,2,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',"Identical to Game 1 Still. This is the very sharp ""flick-knife"" attack. The safest response is considered to be 8...Nfd7 which is what my opponent played in our first game."
34,1,3,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',"!? And we're practically out of the database right here down from a couple thousand games to about 30. According to the literature I've seen White now ""should"" win material with 9.e5 but the path to that outcome is far from clear."
35,1,4,1fxe5,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/5np1/1BpPP3/8/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White now has an imposing center--but it's also very overextended and his development is lagging.
36,1,5,1Nh5,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',My opponent said that he'd also looked at playing 10...O-O?! and sacrificing the Knight which really gets quite wild. I agree with his assessment though that White should be able to hold on long enough to make his material advantage in that line felt though.
37,1,6,1Nf3,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I looked for quite a bit at 11.g4?! At first glance it seems like the obvious move to make but things are always much more complicated than they appear. Just as an example one line (of very many) that I looked at goes: 11.g4?! Qh4+! 12.Kf1 Ng3+ 13.hxg3 Qxh1 14.e6 O-O 15.exd7. I chose the text move instead because I wanted to hold onto my center pawns if possible and because now I have the opportunity to play g2-g4 without worrying about ...Qh4+. It's not obvious now but this Knight will actually play a critical role in White's defenses for the rest of the entire game.
38,1,7,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black wisely gets the hell out of the center.
39,1,8,1Bxd7,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1B1pbp/6p1/2pPP2n/8/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Necessary now that the Bishop is no longer pinned.
40,1,9,1Nxd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/6p1/2pPP2n/8/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I like 12...Qxd7 better because it defends g4...
41,1,10,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/6p1/2pPP2n/6P1/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQK2R b KQ g3',!? I thought long and hard about this move (again). I finally decided that I can make Black give up some material albeit at significant risk to my King. With this move I threw away any chance of a quiet game. Hold on to your hats because things are about to get wild.
42,1,11,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/6p1/2pPP2n/6P1/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQK2R w KQ -',The Knight can't be saved but White's center will fall to pay for it.
43,1,12,1gxh5,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/6p1/2pPP2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',"Take a good long look at every position here: the tactical possibilities are nightmarish. Here I considered rather than taking the Knight things like 14.Bg5?! f6 15.e6!? which essentially leads to a position where half the pieces on the board are hanging all at once. I couldn't begin to calculate it fully so I went with the ""simple"" move you see here."
44,1,13,1Nxe5,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/6p1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Of course. Now White has to fear ...Nxf3++ and 15.Nxe5 doesn't help at all.
45,1,14,1Kf1,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/6p1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ1K1R b - -',Forcing Black to spend a tempo if he wants to get his Knight off the file.
46,1,15,1Qf6,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5qp1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ1K1R w - -',So Black pins the Knight of course which is now barely defensible at all yet responsible for covering four critical squares: h4 g5 e5 and d4.
47,1,16,1Kg2,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5qp1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ3R b - -',"Somewhat strangely this is probably the safest the White King has been for several moves. Let's take stock of the situation briefly.

White is up a Knight for a pawn (two pawns soon). He also has a passed isolani on the fifth rank.

Black for his part has superior development more active pieces in general and a nasty-looking attack on the exposed White King. This folks is anyone's game."
48,1,17,1gxh5,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5q2/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ3R w - -',This is a sort of ugly move but probably necessary as I (as White) was really hoping for a chance to play h5-h6. The text also opens the g-file for possible use by both players against the others' King.
49,1,18,Qg6+,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/6q1/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ2R1 w - -',So naturally both players get on the g-file immediately. Black just has to be careful of the possible pins and get his King to h8 as soon as possible.
50,1,19,1Kh1,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/6q1/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ2RK b - -',"The White King has finally reached ""safety""!"
51,1,20,1Ng4,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/6q1/2pP3p/6n1/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ2RK w - -',"Nasty! Not only does this threaten mate on f2 but White's ""obvious"" response loses nearly as quickly: 19.h3?? Nf2+! 20.Kh2 Nxd1 21.Rxg6 hxg6. Besides that there's still the huge question of when the Black Bishop will spring forward to e5 or d4 to join in the attack. White's Nf3 remains the stalwart defender of those squares."
52,1,21,1Qf1,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/6q1/2pP3p/6n1/2N2N2/PP5P/R1B2QRK b - -',White negates the threats on f2 for now meaning Black has to get his Queen out of the line of fire.
53,1,22,2Bg5,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5q2/2pP2Bp/6n1/2N2N2/PP5P/R4QRK b - -',Twenty moves in White's Queen Bishop finally steps outside freeing the Rook (in theory anyway).
54,1,23,2Qb6,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/1q6/2pP2Bp/6n1/2N2N2/PP5P/R4QRK w - -',Black switches flanks hitting the b-pawn and lining up along the a7-g1 diagonal as well.
55,1,24,2Qg2,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/1q6/2pP2Bp/6n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/R5RK b - -',White piles up on the g-file in preparation for an assault via h2-h3 while defending b2.
56,1,25,2c4,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/1q6/3P2Bp/2p3n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/R5RK w - -',"Had we been playing over-the-board one of us surely would have made a terrible misstep by now. Every move was made by both players with such anxiety punctuated in our chat log. This ""quiet"" move for instance lets the Queen see through to the kingside on the a7-g1 diagonal threatening the devastating ...Nf2+! where White must give up his Queen to prevent the smothered mate."
57,1,26,2Raf1,b'r3r1k1/pp3pbp/1q6/3P2Bp/2p3n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/5RRK b - -',White gets his Rook out of the corner and applies some indirect pressure to the f7 pawn all while reinforcing the defense of f2. But now his g1 Rook is smothered and he must beware Black's Bishop which could win an exchange if the Nf3 lets down its guard of d4.
58,1,27,2Kh8,b'r3r2k/pp3pbp/1q6/3P2Bp/2p3n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/5RRK w - -',I'm frankly impressed that Black managed to get away with waiting this long to play this move.
59,1,28,2Bc1,b'r3r2k/pp3pbp/1q6/3P3p/2p3n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/2B2RRK b - -',! I am still particularly happy with this move which is really an advance disguised as a retreat. From c1 the Bishop still commands a great view of Black's castle and additionally it frees the WQ from her defense of b2 AND frees the g5 square for a White Knight. Now White's threats have come back online viz. h2-h3 pushing the Black Knight out of the way. At the time I was expecting 23...Rg8 which forfeits the f-pawn but makes for a good contest along the g-file and seems to me to lead to a draw.
60,1,29,2Re7,b'r6k/pp2rpbp/1q6/3P3p/2p3n1/2N2N2/PP4QP/2B2RRK w - -',!? Black told me he thought that 23...Rg8 looked somewhat drawish as well but wanted more than that and I don't blame him in this crazy game. The text is an attempt to hold f7 and the e-file at the same time. I wrote extensive notes to myself while analyzing this position trying to see if Black still has a defense against 24.h3. As it turns out he does- I encourage you to look for a good line for Black after 24.h3 before you scroll down.
61,1,30,2h3,b'r6k/pp2rpbp/1q6/3P3p/2p3n1/2N2N1P/PP4Q1/2B2RRK b - -',Obviously the Knight can't simply move or Black gets mated so instead complications are in order. The best line I found goes something like this: 24...f5! 25.hxg4 fxg4!? 26.Ng5?! Bd4 27.Nf7+ Kg7 28.Bh6+ Kg8 where Black looks like he might be okay with threats against many White pieces and THREE kingside passers.
62,1,31,2Bd4,b'r6k/pp2rp1p/1q6/3P3p/2pb2n1/2N2N1P/PP4Q1/2B2RRK w - -',? I think allowing White to eliminate this Bishop is a mistake. That said it's still not clear-cut but all the lines I found that looked okay for Black hinged on driving away the Nf3 before playing ...Bd4.
63,1,32,2Nxd4,b'r6k/pp2rp1p/1q6/3P3p/2pN2n1/2N4P/PP4Q1/2B2RRK b - -',White's bravest cavalry regiment willingly throws down his life defending one of his critical squares.
64,1,33,Rg8,b'6rk/pp2rp1p/8/3P3p/2pq2P1/2N5/PP4Q1/2B2RRK w - -',Here's the big difference between 24...f5! and 24...Bd4? -- Black no longer has the initiative in this line and is forced to try to stave off White's attacks instead of making his own. 
65,1,34,Qg6,b'6rk/pp2rp1p/6q1/3P3p/2p2RP1/2N5/PP4Q1/2BR3K w - -',Now the g-pawn is pinned to the White Queen but White has no real reason to take on h5 anyway--he has more pressing business in the center. As long as he prevents Black from storming down the kingside with three connected passers he should be fine.
66,1,35,2Re4,b'6rk/pp2rp1p/6q1/3P3p/2p1R1P1/2N5/PP4Q1/2BR3K b - -',Forcing a trade (if the Rook shifts off the e-file White can simply play g4-g5 and then Bf4 and d5-d6.
67,1,36,3Be3,b'6rk/pp3p1p/6q1/3P4/2p1N1p1/4B3/PP4Q1/3R3K b - -',Threatening Bd4+.
68,1,37,3Qh2,b'6rk/pp3p1p/8/3P3q/2p1N1p1/4B3/PP5Q/3R3K b - -',White would be thrilled with a Queen trade at this point. Black only played 31...Qh5+ to draw the WQ off the h1-e4 diagonal but by now White simply has too many resources.
69,1,38,3Qf5,b'6rk/pp3p1p/8/3P1q2/2p1N1p1/4B3/PP5Q/3R3K w - -',32...Qxh2+ was better. Now it's all over.
70,1,39,Rg7,b'7k/pp3prp/8/3P1q2/2pBN1p1/8/PP5Q/3R3K w - -',33...f6 34.Bxf6+ Qxf6 35.Nxf6 Kg7 doesn't quite lead to instant mate but obviously it's over.
71,1,40,3Qb8+,b'1Q5k/pp3prp/8/3P1q2/2pBN1p1/8/PP6/3R3K b - -',1-0. Mate in one and Black resigns after a grueling back-and-forth struggle. If anyone out there has the time to offer some insights into the midgame positions I'd be honored to hear your thoughts. Many thanks to ptitroque for a truly excellent game!

Just because I often move an early e5 to give black fits and take him out of any ideas of a traditional French. Yes it loses a tempo and is probably unsound. But it's fun and to me that is what chess is. Fun!
355,9,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So I do this.
356,9,2,exd6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3Pp3/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',And exchange it off. Black now has a lead in development and white has gained nothing except that black is no longer just playing 'book' French Defense moves.

You see here is the fun in what I just did: black ought to play aggressively now and continue to do so. But someone who favors a certain style of play can't easily switch gears... yet... if I'm playing a really highly rated player I don't play like this. There's no getting away with such games then!
358,9,4,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/1B6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black obliges. I've given him every opportunity to play much more aggressively and still he favors the stolid type opening. But... stay tuned.

Now this guy was rated 1650 and although I have defeated players rated above 2300 (well and lost to those also) he's just plain kicking my posterior. In this rather sad position I realize I will lose this game without a major shift on my part.
373,9,19,1Bxh6,b'rn1q1rk1/1b3pp1/3b1n1B/p2P4/Pp6/1Pp2N2/2B2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - -',So why not I thought. This game is lost Dr. Jekyll has seen to it... but wait a minute Dr. Jekyll is no where to be found of a sudden. Instead there is naught but a hideous noise now as Mr. Hyde suddenly sits on the other side of the board.
374,9,20,1Ng4,b'rn1q1rk1/1b3pp1/3b3B/p2P4/Pp4n1/1Pp2N2/2B2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',"Well HECK I thought. I was throwing the bishop away for a chance at some counterplay. Seriously outmanned outpositioned and just crushed on the queenside this move astounds me. So I give further instructions to the bishop. ""Continue"" I said ""excommunicating the King's knaves"". The bishop complies as most are wont to be obedient..."

376,9,22,2Qd4+,b'rn1q1r2/1b3pk1/3b4/p2P4/Pp1Q2n1/1Pp2N2/2B2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',The tunnel is still dark any light is likely an oncoming train. But I am not willing to just give up despite my earlier horrendous play. Turns out Mr. Hyde is about to lose in great style here.
377,9,23,2Qh4,b'rn1q1r2/1b3pk1/3b1n2/p2P4/Pp5Q/1Pp2N2/2B2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',Suddenly the Black King is very uncomfortable despite a major part of my army having a tea party in the corner of the board.
378,9,24,2Qg5+,b'rn1q3r/1b3pk1/3b1n2/p2P2Q1/Pp6/1Pp2N2/2B2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',Another fruitless check but what else does white have? Nothing. Oh wait that's right. Mr. Hyde is playing...
379,9,25,2h3,b'rn1q1k1r/1b3p2/3b1n2/p2P2Q1/Pp6/1Pp2N1P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',A nod to the pressure on the white King. Mr. Hyde now begins to make moves I don't understand. Nearly everyone would see that trading of pieces in this position would result in a won endgame for black as not only am I down a piece I will likely lose another piece just to liberate the queenside pieces that Dr. Jekyll so neatly imprisoned in a very strong dungeon.
380,9,26,2Bxd5,b'rn1q1k1r/5p2/3b1n2/p2b2Q1/Pp6/1Pp2N1P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',"But inexplicably Mr. Hyde gives in to his animal nature. ""Pawn. Must grab pawn"". And so he does."
381,9,27,2Nd4,b'rn1q1k1r/5p2/3b1n2/p2b2Q1/Pp1N4/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',All kinds of black tactics are available but Dr. Jekyll is no where in sight. This is my most embarrassing game I've played including the blitz games I've lost to others. It's hilarious! When you play like I have in this game you realize: it's time to go to bed and give it a rest. But I couldn't resist annotating this one. The entertainment continues...
382,9,28,2Nbd7,b'r2q1k1r/3n1p2/3b1n2/p2b2Q1/Pp1N4/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',Inexplicably black decides he needs further help. Let's see; I'm assaulting the black king with two pieces and there are six swarming to it's defense. Oh wait I miscounted: the Rook has the e file. 
383,9,29,2Nf5,b'r2q1k1r/3n1p2/3b1n2/p2b1NQ1/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',I really didn't think this was going anywhere but about this point I realize that black's king really is in a little trouble. Now. Thanks to Mr. Hyde's reluctance to trade queens. A softspot for a pretty lady has been many a downfall for us guys hasn't it.
384,9,30,2Bh2+,b'r2q1k1r/3n1p2/5n2/p2b1NQ1/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PPb/RN2R1K1 w - -',Black does this but for the life of me I can't figure out why.
385,9,31,2Kg1,b'r4k1r/2qn1p2/5n2/p2b1NQ1/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',So I can understand a reluctance to trade queens I suppose. There is after all something to be said for holding onto one's firepower. But here white's king still has ample protection for the time being despite the ponderous pressure heading that way. Meanwhile I practically jump at the chance to get back in the game...
386,9,32,2Be6,b'r4k1r/2qn1p2/4bn2/p4NQ1/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',This move was probably necessary but it's far too slow for the position. I understand it; cutting the rook off from the e file. Black should have seen to his defense a lot sooner and now it's too late. There is lousy chess like I played for most of the first part of this game and good chess such as Dr. Jekyll played. And then there's the total wreck Mr. Hyde is inflicting on himself. There's a reason Dr. Jekyll is the one that should do the chess playing!
387,9,33,Ke8,b'r3k2r/2qn1pQ1/4bn2/p4N2/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',Forced.
388,9,34,Nf8,b'r3kn1Q/2q2p2/4bn2/p4N2/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',Also forced pretty much.
389,9,35,3Qxf6,b'r3kn2/2q2p2/4bQ2/p4N2/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',I am now winning since Dr. Jekyll retired. Mr Hyde ensures such to be the case with his next move:
390,9,36,3Nh7,b'r3k3/2q2p1n/4bQ2/p4N2/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',Nh7? Perhaps it deserves two ?'s. Mr. Hyde is reluctant to leave his pawn thinking falsely that it will protect him. And this last move results in at least massive material loss for black. Even Dr. Jekyll could not fix Mr. Hyde's position now.
391,9,37,3Ng7+,b'r3k3/2q2pNn/4bQ2/p7/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',There are only two available moves. One leads to a mate in four: Kf8. The other Kd7 is not much better.
392,9,38,3Kf8,b'r4k2/2q2pNn/4bQ2/p7/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 w - -',Kf8?? And Mr Hyde has undone all of Dr. Jekyll's fine work. The simple tactical shot wins...
393,9,39,3Nxe6+,b'r4k2/2q2p1n/4NQ2/p7/Pp6/1Pp4P/2B2PP1/RN2R1K1 b - -',Now the mate is in three and it's a nice one. ( ...Ke8 Nf8!+ Kxf8 Qh8#) Even novice players will notice if the mate is missed that besides the fork of the black queen to add insult to injury yet another fork after on the rook exists too. Thus Mr. Hyde recognized that it was curtains for him and stomps off in a rage. I certainly learned one thing from this: not to take pawn advances so carelessly just because my opponent doesn't seem all that highly rated. I'll probably still play nearly anything to avoid obvious book lines because I'm lazy don't want to memorize a lot of openings and enjoy odd positions. But when you do that take it from me: sometimes you'll face Dr. Jekyll not always Mr. Hyde.
394,10,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White begins with the Reti opening.
395,10,1,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A very unorthodox move for black.  I suppose he is just toying with me or perhaps he is providing a handicap in order to give me a chance.  I am sure there is a name for this defense but I don't know what it is.  The GameKnot database says that there have only been 83 people in the history of the universe that have ever used this response to the Reti.
396,10,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White pushes the d pawn rather than the c which means that we are no longer following Reti.  I was spooked away from pushing the c because I thought my opponent had something up his sleeve.  
397,10,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black opens the diagonals for the Queen and Bishop.  This strikes me as a conservative move.  Not showing any aggression here.
398,10,4,Bf4,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Developing a Bishop.
399,10,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Developing a Knight.
400,10,6,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq c3',I push the c pawn which discorages the black d pawn from coming forward and it also opens a diagonal for my Queen.
401,10,7,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1pppbppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Another conservative move for black.  This allows him to castle on the next move if he desires to do so.
402,10,8,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/1pppbppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Developing my other horse.
403,10,9,d5,b'rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq d6',Here comes that d pawn that I was expecting.  The black d pawn is protected in 3 ways.
404,10,10,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/3P4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I decide to swap pawns.  The experts say that center pawns are worth more than the others so if I can take a d pawn with a c pawn then it seems like a good idea to me.
405,10,11,Nxd5,b'rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black evens up the score using his horse.  This threatens the unprotected white Bishop which perhaps should never have been placed there to begin with.
406,10,12,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The white Bishop tucks his tail and retreats whilst giving a little more support to the white Knight.
407,10,13,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Black castles.  Another solid conservative move.
408,10,14,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3PP3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ e3',White now has a pawn on e4 and d4 supported by Knights on c3 and f3.  In all the books I have read this is a really good thing for white.  This is the classic center-controlling set up that people drool over.  I am feeling really good at this point.
409,10,15,Nxc3,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/8/3PP3/2n2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Black decides to swap Knights.  This negates my protection on e4.  
410,10,16,bxc3,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',White evens the score.  I opted to take the Knight with the b pawn instead of the Bishop.  In my opinion its a good idea to support your center pawns with other pawns rather than with pieces.  This gives my Bishop a chance to do other things rather than to babysit with pawns.
411,10,17,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ c6',Black attacks my precious center pawns which I was so proud of.  Looks like they won't stay there for long.
412,10,18,1Rb1,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R b K -',White ignores the pawn threat because the d pawn is so nicely protected by the c pawn.  White decides to take control of that empty b file.  In the books that I have read it says that controlling territory is a good thing.
413,10,19,1Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R w K -',Black piles more threats on d4 and develops a Knight in the ordinary fashion.
414,10,20,1Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/1R1QKB1R b K -',I am trying with all my might to maintain my beautiful e4 and d4 which everyone tells me is such a wonderful thing to behold.
415,10,21,1cxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3pP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/1R1QKB1R w K -',Black hammers away at my wall.
416,10,22,1cxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/4BN2/P4PPP/1R1QKB1R b K -',Once again I have my d4 and e4 back.  I am so proud.  My d4 is protected with 3 pieces.  My e4 has no protection at all.  That could be a bad omen.
417,10,23,1Qa5+,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/q7/3PP3/4BN2/P4PPP/1R1QKB1R w K -',Now we see that white should never have moved the Rook to b.  The black Queen executes a lovely forking maneuver threatening both the King and the a pawn.
418,10,24,1Bd2,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/q7/3PP3/5N2/P2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R b K -',I decide not to block the check with my Queen because then the black Bishop would come down and give me a nasty Skewer.  By blocking with my Bishop I lose a pawn but the alternative would be really bad.
419,10,25,1Qxa2,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/q2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R w K -',As expected white loses a4 and goes a point down.
420,10,26,1Be2,b'r1b2rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K -',I suppose the Queen scared me and I am now preparing to castle.
421,10,27,1Rd8,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1QK2R w K -',Black threatens d4
422,10,28,1Ra1,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/q2BBPPP/R2QK2R b K -',"White ignores the threat on d4 and decides to play ""chase the queen."""
423,10,29,1Qb2,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/1q1BBPPP/R2QK2R w K -',The queen ducks away.
424,10,30,1Rb1,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/1q1BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K -',"White continues with this game of ""chase the queen."" "
425,10,31,1Qa3,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/q4N2/3BBPPP/1R1QK2R w K -',The queen ducks away again.
426,10,32,1Ra1,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/q4N2/3BBPPP/R2QK2R b K -',White continues to pester.
427,10,33,1Qd6,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1nqp3/8/3PP3/5N2/3BBPPP/R2QK2R w K -',Black Queen finally takes the hint.  White d4 now has 3 threats and only one protector.
428,10,34,1Bc3,b'r1br2k1/1p2bppp/p1nqp3/8/3PP3/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2QK2R b K -',White adds two protectors to d4.
429,10,35,1Rb8,b'1rbr2k1/1p2bppp/p1nqp3/8/3PP3/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2QK2R w K -',Black prepares to push the b pawn.  I am now thinking that my last move should have been Bishop to e3 rather than c3.
430,10,36,1O-O,b'1rbr2k1/1p2bppp/p1nqp3/8/3PP3/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White takes the opportunity to castle.
431,10,37,1b5,b'1rbr2k1/4bppp/p1nqp3/1p6/3PP3/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - b6',As expected black pushes the b pawn.  No threat yet but it will be soon.
432,10,38,2e5,b'1rbr2k1/4bppp/p1nqp3/1p2P3/3P4/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"White decides to abandon the classic e4 d4 pawn structure to continue the game of ""chase the queen.""  I can't really claim that e4 and d4 was doing me any good but all the books say that it is such a wonderful thing.  I guess I am proud that I could maintain those 2 soldiers for as long as I did."
433,10,39,2Qc7,b'1rbr2k1/2q1bppp/p1n1p3/1p2P3/3P4/2B2N2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I scared the black queen away.  This makes me happy.  It takes some pressure off of d4.  The black queen is now in a cramped place.
434,10,40,2Qd2,b'1rbr2k1/2q1bppp/p1n1p3/1p2P3/3P4/2B2N2/3QBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I made this move to control more territory to allow my Rooks more freedom to move on the back row and I was also thinking about executing a Skewer by putting my Bishop on a5.
435,10,41,2b4,b'1rbr2k1/2q1bppp/p1n1p3/4P3/1p1P4/2B2N2/3QBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Here comes that b pawn that I was expecting.  Once again I am wishing that I had put that Bishop on e3 rather than c3.

439,10,45,2Nxf3+,b'1rbr2k1/2q1bppp/p3p3/8/1p1P1Q2/5n2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Another brilliant move for black.  It is always a good idea to check. Now the white Queen is in trouble.
440,10,46,2Qxf3,b'1rbr2k1/2q1bppp/p3p3/8/1p1P4/5Q2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',White gets out of the predicament and remains 2 points down.  The white d4 pawn is very lonely with no supporting pawns although not in trouble right now.
441,10,47,2Bb7,b'1r1r2k1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/8/1p1P4/5Q2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now black plays chase the queen.
442,10,48,2Qg4,b'1r1r2k1/1bq1bppp/p3p3/8/1p1P2Q1/8/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',White queen moves out of harms way.
443,10,49,2Qc2,b'1r1r2k1/1b2bppp/p3p3/8/1p1P2Q1/8/1Bq1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Another nice move for black.  The b2 Bishop is nearly trapped.

CONCLUSION: There were 2 or 3 brilliant moves executed by black which ultimately won the game for him.  These move were completely unexpected by white.  This game demonstrates what happens when a strong player meets a mediocre one."
456,11,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now these are four typical moves in the Sicilian. From here black usually will play Nc6 although Bg4 is played too. In addition my opponent can play g6 intending to fianchetto. There are so many different lines and transpositions possible that it's impossible for me to remember them all.
457,11,1,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So my first order of business get rid of the white bishops. I am going to control the white squares with my pawns. This does lead to a rather boring game. Some years ago MSN hosted Kasparov against the world and in a similar position he apologized for choosing a similar line because he didn't want to reveal any of his real preparation for upcoming matches for the world championship; and at that time his apology was for the 'drawish and boring' kind of game that would result. If any of you have looked at that game that's not how that game turned out in actuality!
458,11,2,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He obliges. Nd7 was possible here although the continuation of that could result in a long pin after c4 and Qa4. But that was not my strategy.
459,11,3,Nxd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Recapturing with the knight or queen is possible here.
460,11,4,c4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',I deviate from the 'book' with this move. This is an attempt by me to emulate a little the Maroczy bind position after trading off the white bishops allowing my knight on f3 to avoid annoying pins after I castle kingside cramp black's position and prevent him from opening up the c file easily. At this point in the game black can respond in a couple of different ways: e6 is possible Ngf6 is possible as is a6 and g6. I like white's position because black cannot easily continue in typical Sicilian fashion. Which is why I chose to do this because everyone knows the Sicilian is one of the better attempts by black to score the point.
461,11,5,g6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',And here black says: so what. I'm still going to develop my Sicilian. Appears he is looking to perhaps set up an accelerated dragon position and in this case could try to get play down the a/b files but since my king will not be castled over there I don't fear it. I simply have to protect my pieces down there and launch a kingside attack as soon as I can.
462,11,6,a3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2P1P3/P4N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I don't think this was accurate by me in this position; there are better things I could do just now but later I may advance the b pawn up two depending on how black responds.
463,11,7,Bg7,b'r2qk1nr/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/2p5/2P1P3/P4N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The fianchetto. I don't want doubled pawns in this position so I am going to protect the knight with my queen for a few moves.
464,11,8,Ngf6,b'r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/P4N2/1PQP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This is a good move by black. He's ready to castle and begin operations. I am still slow to develop because of my less than accurate a pawn move.
465,11,9,e6,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1pbp/3ppnp1/2p5/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1PQP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',So black appears to have the dragon formation fully set up. I am woefully behind in development.
466,11,10,a6,b'r2qk2r/1p1n1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p5/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This move by black prevents Nb5 eyeing d6 and threatening the rook/king fork. In this position it's easily defended so that was not even in my thoughts. Black is going to castle kingside now so I need to castle and launch an attack before he does.
467,11,11,1Bg5,b'r2qk2r/1p1n1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1PQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',First I pin the knight.
468,11,12,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1PQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',And black unpins his knight with this queen move. There are potential tactics now involving the black knight coming to g4...
469,11,13,1O-O,b'r3k2r/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',But with the white bishops off the board if I had to chase it away with h3 I would not feel uncomfortable doing that. Black here could have forced things on his kingside specifically my dark-squared bishop but had other ideas.
470,11,14,1O-O,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now all my potential attack is pointed at the kingside. But had he castled queenside I could have immediately pushed that b pawn thanks to my a pawn move earlier. Then it would have been interesting to see whose attack hit first... But since he castled kingside he'll have to weather a storm for a while.
471,11,15,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I want to remove the black bishop and avoid a counter in the center with my queen on c2 as d5 is really contested right now. Black could have chased my bishop away earlier but now it's too late to do that.
472,11,16,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2ppnp1/2p3B1/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Indirectly x-raying the white queen again with thoughts of a counter in the middle. But no time for black to do so; I give him his first real choice of the game:
473,11,17,Nb6,b'3r1rk1/1pq2pbp/pn1ppnpB/2p5/2P1P3/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black is still intent on his thrust in the middle and taking with his bishop can be dangerous. So I interrupt his plans a little by my own plan to weaken the dark squares around his king.
474,11,18,1h4,b'3r1r2/1pq2pkp/pn1ppnp1/2p5/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PP1/R4RK1 b - h3',And immediately launch the pawn! H pawns can cause all kinds of headaches. In this kind of position the h pawn can cause havoc and the defensive liability to the white king is not yet critical.
475,11,19,1h5,b'3r1r2/1pq2pk1/pn1ppnp1/2p4p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PP1/R4RK1 w - h6',So far phase one of my plan has succeeded. The dark squares around the black king are very weak now and soon I'll be moving my queen and continuing with the rest of my plans. Very soon as the white knight no longer needs a defender other than the b pawn for now and the white queen is still vulnerable to a thrust in the center.
476,11,20,1Rae1,b'3r1r2/1pq2pk1/pn1ppnp1/2p4p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PP1/4RRK1 b - -',This is to get my a file rook in the game and threaten the e pawn advance. I am ready to counter d5 now despite my queen's rather tenous position being eyed by the black rook. I probably should have moved my queen first to e2 then position the rook but after ...d5 I have e5 then ...Ng4 I have Qe2 and things open up with an uncertain position.
477,11,21,1e5,b'3r1r2/1pq2pk1/pn1p1np1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P1Q1PP1/4RRK1 w - -',This surprised me really. I thought d5 was going to come as he seemed all set up to do that. But I guess he didn't like what he saw... however now his plans of counter play in the center or queenside are rather nil and black's position is really cramped all because of this pawn move. he could later try f5 but he's no where ready to yet. After some thought I might even be tempted to say this black move deserves a ? because now his game can't really get untracked.
478,11,22,1Nh2,b'3r1r2/1pq2pk1/pn1p1np1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP4/1P1Q1PPN/4RRK1 b - -',I am taking a little chance now. I want to crack the kingside open and to do it I need to support the action with my knight. With the middle tied up black will have to counter on the kingside perhaps with f5 as I mentioned; but he can't for a bit. In fact all avenues for black counter play are currently blocked by his own knights and his other pieces are not coordinated well towards a plan. Meanwhile I have two plans I am considering: g4 or f4 depending. Opening up that Kingside!
479,11,23,1Qe7,b'3r1r2/1p2qpk1/pn1p1np1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP4/1P1Q1PPN/4RRK1 w - -',This is to prevent the white queen  moving to g5. I do it anyway. I don't need my queen to infiltrate the black position.
480,11,24,Rfe8,b'3rr3/1p2qpk1/pn1p1np1/2p1p1Qp/2P1P2P/P1NP4/1P3PPN/4RRK1 w - -',And now black is ready to move the black knight.
481,11,25,1g4,b'3rr3/1p2qpk1/pn1p1np1/2p1p1Qp/2P1P1PP/P1NP4/1P3P1N/4RRK1 b - g3',But not before I get in g4. F4 would have been better here; g4 is a mistake by me.
482,11,26,1Nh7,b'3rr3/1p2qpkn/pn1p2p1/2p1p1Qp/2P1P1PP/P1NP4/1P3P1N/4RRK1 w - -',Well so the queens must come off. Forced in this position. Much better for black was Nxg4 winning a pawn. I got a little lucky here.
483,11,27,gxh5,b'3r4/1p2rpkn/pn1p4/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP4/1P3P1N/4RRK1 w - -',Perhaps we could have some rook exchances on the g file. Chances are still equal here; my attack has nearly run out of steam but I still have the initiative...
484,11,28,Re6,b'3r4/1p3pkn/pn1pr3/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P3P2/4RRK1 w - -',A reasonable counter.
485,11,29,2Kh2,b'3r4/1p3pkn/pn1pr3/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P3P1K/4RR2 b - -',Preparing Rg1 of course.
486,11,30,2Rfg1,b'3r4/1p3pkn/pn1p2r1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P3P1K/4R1R1 b - -',Since black is slow to bring his other rook to the party I will either double up my rooks or cause my f pawn to migrate to the g file. Either way I should get access to the kingside soon.
487,11,31,2Re8,b'4r3/1p3pkn/pn1p2r1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1N2/1P3P1K/4R1R1 w - -',This felt slow to me. Surely a better move would have been Rg8 for black. Perhaps he wants to bring his f pawn to the g file and hopes I'll take.
488,11,32,2Reg1,b'8/1p3pkn/pn1pr1r1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1NR1/1P3P1K/6R1 b - -',I have ideas of moving my knight to g5 just to see if black will take and allow my king access to his h pawn as I'd retake with the pawn. But he's too good to let me do that. 
489,11,33,2fxg3,b'8/1p3pkn/pn1pr3/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1NP1/1P5K/6R1 b - -',Now my pawns are connected and I'm ready to see if I can get to his kingside. I think I surprised him a little by taking with the pawn but it's the right move if I wish to maintain some kind of pressure on the black king.
490,11,34,2Kh3,b'8/1p3pkn/pn1p2r1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1NPK/1P6/6R1 b - -',Preparing g4.
491,11,35,2Nf6,b'8/1p3pk1/pn1p1nr1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP1NPK/1P6/6R1 w - -',Preparing Ng4. But I had forseen this position and moved the obvious:
492,11,36,2Nh2,b'8/1p3pk1/pn1p1nr1/2p1p2p/2P1P2P/P1NP2PK/1P5N/6R1 b - -',Nh2! Why the exclamation point? Because from here on in I will have a passed pawn threat. And black has to stay on the defensive and soon my other white knight will be rather more powerful than a mere knight!
493,11,37,2Ng4,b'8/1p3pk1/pn1p2r1/2p1p2p/2P1P1nP/P1NP2PK/1P5N/6R1 w - -',A good try to blockade the position.
494,11,38,Rxg4,b'8/1p3pk1/pn1p4/2p1p2p/2P1P1rP/P1NP2PK/1P6/6R1 w - -',I wonder if ...hxg4 was better here. The white King could not get past that pawn easily and the entire kingside may have stayed blockaded. Here black apparently did not want me to get a passed pawn. But it allows something else...
495,11,39,3Rf1,b'8/1p3pk1/pn1p4/2p1p2p/2P1P1rP/P1NP2PK/1P6/5R2 b - -',The critical point of the game. Black doesn't see it until his next turn. But even if ...Kg6 after Rf5 what can black do? It's nearly a Zugzwang on the kingside and if black moves his knight the white night infiltrates and causes a lot of problems. It looks like a pawn will fall or after Nd1 and Ne3 the black rook falls if the King is on g6. If black counters with his own knight moves after the exchanges white has an extra pawn. If black moves Rg6 after Rf5 and ...Rh6 white has Rg5+ further restricting black and can switch to the queenside and move b4. Black may be able to try other moves but this position requires great accuracy by black to prevent white obtaining an advantage.
496,11,40,3f6,b'8/1p4k1/pn1p1p2/2p1p2p/2P1P1rP/P1NP2PK/1P6/5R2 w - -',That made it easier for white.
497,11,41,3Rf5,b'8/1p4k1/pn1p1p2/2p1pR1p/2P1P1rP/P1NP2PK/1P6/8 b - -',With this move I had two ways to win a pawn; and black saw it a little too late. As I said Kg6 traps the rook to Nd1 and Ne3 and ultimately white gets a passed pawn. After a short think black sort of throws in the towel...
498,11,42,Nd7,b'8/1p1n2k1/p2p1pr1/2p1p2R/2P1P2P/P1NP2PK/1P6/8 w - -',This defends f6 but allows Nd5.
499,11,43,3Nd5,b'8/1p1n2k1/p2p1pr1/2pNp2R/2P1P2P/P2P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',Nd5! Well I exclamation pointed it not because it wins but because it's just a great outpost. ;)
500,11,44,3b5,b'8/3n2k1/p2p1pr1/1ppNp2R/2P1P2P/P2P2PK/1P6/8 w - b6',This was ill advised! I don't think black calculated out my response. Perhaps this was an attempt to distract but now black loses because white has a simple tactic to get another passed pawn on the queenside. B5 probably needs a ? or even two of them.
501,11,45,axb5,b'8/3n2k1/3p1pr1/1ppNp2R/4P2P/P2P2PK/1P6/8 w - -',And...
502,11,46,3Nc7,b'8/2Nn2k1/3p1pr1/1pp1p2R/4P2P/P2P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',Nc7! This deserves the exclamation point obvious or not! The coupe de grace so to speak. Black tries b4...
503,11,47,3b4,b'8/2Nn2k1/3p1pr1/2p1p2R/1p2P2P/P2P2PK/1P6/8 w - -',I ignore it of course! Perhaps c4 would have been a better try because then perhaps his own center pawns could have become mobilized too.
504,11,48,3a4,b'8/2Nn2k1/3p1pr1/2p1p2R/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',a4!
505,11,49,3Nb8,b'1n6/2N3k1/3p1pr1/2p1p2R/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 w - -',And with black deciding to try to keep the passed pawn from queening on the queenside he leaves open a veritable slew of holes in his defense and play continues for a while with white taking advantage of them.
506,11,50,3Ne8+,b'1n2N3/6k1/3p1pr1/2p1p2R/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',With the threat of two passed pawns on opposite sides of the board and numerous knight forks upcoming black's game goes down hill fast but there was little for him to do at this point anyways.
507,11,51,4Rh7+,b'1n6/3k3R/5pr1/2p1pN2/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',Here I think black was just moving and had ceased really considering the board but his game has been lost for a few moves now.
508,11,52,4Kc6,b'1n6/7R/2k2pr1/2p1pN2/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 w - -',There were no more good moves left to black at this point.
509,11,53,4Nxg6,b'1n6/7R/1k3pN1/2p1p3/Pp2P2P/3P2PK/1P6/8 b - -',And black resigned. A fun game against a Sicilian albeit probably a little boring unlike most Sicilians. The push d5 by black would have been a much more interesting game I'm thinking! Thanks for getting this far. Any comments are appreciated.

638,19,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I start the game using the Reti opening.  This is my favorite opening du jour when I am playing white.  I start with Reti and then I try to parlay it into the Queens Gambit.  This is something that I have been doing for the last year or so.  I have pretty good success with it and it is a lot of fun.
639,19,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Black marches out the Queen Pawn.  This is a pretty standard response to Reti.  Of course it would not be a good idea to march out the King Pawn because my faithful steed would eat him for lunch.
640,19,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I know that the standard Reti opening says that white should go c4 here but I don't like doing that. I always like to immediately block an opponents pawn on the 5th rank.  If I don't block then there is always a chance that he might be able to push it to the 4th rank in the future and I hate being boxed it.  I don't like to have my mobility hindered.  
641,19,3,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',This is unusual and perhaps this is the beginning of the downfall for black but I don't see it as a big mistake.  It is just unorthodox.  I am not sure what he is trying to do.  Perhaps some sort of Kings Gambit.  In my opinion moving the f pawn is not a good idea because you are loosing some protection for your King.
642,19,4,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',"Now I parlay into the Queens Gambit which is really fun for me.  As I said before I have been doing this for about a year now and I really like it.  This does a lot of good things for white.  It opens up a path for the Queen to make a check.  It acts as a lure to pull the black pawn out of the center.  If he accepts the Gambit then I check with the Queen and immediately get back my lost Pawn.

One thing I don't like is the fact that the black Pawn on f remains unblocked. Maybe this is just my own idiosyncrasy."
643,19,5,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/5p2/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black accepts the Gambit.  I am not smart enough to know if this is a good idea or not.  White can easily get the pawn back but then black can start attacking the Queen.  I don't think this is a blunder for black but maybe a contributing factor to the downfall.
644,19,6,Qa4+,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/5p2/Q1pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"This is my standard response when black accepts the Gambit.  I check the King and also put the black Pawn in jeopardy. It is a fun trick although I know that it can be bad to bring out the Queen this early.  It give black the opportunity to start taking pot shots at her.  It can easily lead to a game of ""chase the queen."""
645,19,7,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppbp1pp/8/5p2/Q1pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',This is one of the standard responses for black.  He could have also blocked with the Knight.  Either way works fine.  Neither way prevents me from taking the Pawn back.
646,19,8,Qxc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppbp1pp/8/5p2/2QP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',I now have my Pawn back and the score is back to even.  My Queen is hanging out there and very vulnerable to attack.
647,19,9,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/4p3/5p2/2QP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',"This looks like a pretty good idea for black.  He opens up a path for both his Queen and his Bishop.  He also gives protection to that f pawn which was hanging out there by its lonesome.

Notice that white has both the d and e pawns in tact and black has lost his d pawn. According to the experts this is a really good thing for white although I am not smart enough at this point in my chess career to understand why."
648,19,10,d5,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/4p3/3P1p2/2Q5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"I push my d pawn here.  This prevents the black Knight from coming out but of course black will consider swapping pawns with me.  If black does swap pawns then that black f pawn will be hanging out by its lonesome again.

This is a very aggressive move for white and if I was in a different mood I might not have done it.  It is likely that I will lose my d pawn which the experts say is a no no.  I guess I was in an ""easy come easy go"" type of mood.  Let's roll the dice.  You only live once."
649,19,11,exd5,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/8/3p1p2/2Q5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',So black takes my d pawn.  That is what I would have done also.  I don't see any blunder here.  Of course white will take the pawn back on the next move.
650,19,12,Qxd5,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/8/3Q1p2/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',"As expected white takes the pawn back and the score is even.  The white Queen is very vulnerable to attack although she can easily tuck her tail and zip home for lunch if black threatens her.  Also the white King is vulnerable to check but it can be easily blocked.

The black f pawn is not threatened at this point because it is protected by the black Bishop."
651,19,13,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n5/3Q1p2/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',OK this looks like a standard good move for black.  He brings out his Knight.  Very ordinary move and it looks like a fine move to me.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Black is just doing normal development.  He does not threaten my Queen as I was expecting but this move looks OK to me.
652,19,14,Ne5,b'r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n5/3QNp2/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Another aggressive move for white.  I must be in a Monte Carlo type of mood.  Let's roll the dice.  This Knight is not protecting any pawns so lets put him into action.  The experts would say that white should develop more pieces here: bring out the other white Knight or the bishop or push the e pawn.  But I am in a strange mood today.
653,19,15,Nge7,b'r2qkb1r/pppbn1pp/2n5/3QNp2/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black decides to threaton the Queen.  Looks like a good idea.  Let's get that Queen out of here.  Makes sense.  And while doing that black also adds protection to the f pawn.  Good idea in general. But alas this is a huge mistake.  Black did not notice the checkmate.  He should have swapped Knights with me although that would have left him in check but it could have been easily blocked.
654,19,16,Qf7#,b'r2qkb1r/pppbnQpp/2n5/4Np2/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Checkmate in 9 moves.  I am pretty proud of this but lets talk about what caused the downfall for black.  Moving that f pawn was strange but I don't think that was the big mistake.  I think the mistake was that black should have started attacking the white Queen as soon as possible.  Black kept ignoring the Queen and she ultimately had her way with him.  Of course black simply did not see the checkmate or he could have stopped it.  That was a giant blunder for sure.  But black should have chased her away long before she got to that position.

I recently managed to add another Expert Draw to my growing collection.  This time it was against Battlefleet (Stephen) Brigadecommander's (Janet's) brother.  This match started as a Queen's Gambit Accepted.

But I need to explore that more fully against lower rated players first to see how it feels. So I develop as I am wont to when I play against the Sicilian and plan c4...

But because black has fianchettoed it would appear I have plenty of time for getting ready to assault the black king. He also said that black should really move e6 probably before attempting to open things up with d5. Perhaps my opponent did not realize this.
806,27,4,d6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This move prompts me to move my king.

This gives me the option of advancing the f pawn without any tactics occuring on the g1-a7 diagonal; and also if the bishop comes to g4 it allows me to move Ng1 serving three purposes: getting out of the way of the f pawn and threatening the bishop on g4 while protecting my own bishop and if retaking again keeping the d4 square somewhat contested.
808,27,6,a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/P2P1N2/1P2BPPP/RNBQ1R1K b - -',My queen will go to c2; this will avoid an annoying attack because I want my queen on c2!!

810,27,8,1Ng1,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P1b1/P2P4/1PQ1BPPP/RNB2RNK b - -',Now here I've played against players who move Nd4 in this position. Here however black does not.
811,27,9,1Nxe2,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/P2P4/1PQ1NPPP/RNB2R1K b - -',Okay this is the position that I wanted. I am sure black can play more challenging but when I am playing against the Sicilian I like this position for white. Black really should consider e6 here I'm thinking.
812,27,10,1Qd7,b'r4rk1/1p1qppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/P2P4/1PQ1NPPP/RNB2R1K w - -',I am not so sure that is the best square for the black queen.
813,27,11,Ng4,b'r4rk1/1p1qppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/2P1P1n1/P1NP4/1PQ1NPPP/R1B2R1K w - -',Well I had planned on advancing my f pawn. This doesn't seem to do much.
814,27,12,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/1p1qppbp/p1np2p1/2pNn3/2P1P3/P2P1P2/1PQ1N1PP/R1B2R1K b - -',Before I kick the black knight on e5 away I get in this in-between move threatening Nb6. It forces black to take a tempo to prevent that.
815,27,13,1Qd8,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2pNn3/2P1P3/P2P1P2/1PQ1N1PP/R1B2R1K w - -',It would seem black had ideas of playing down the queenside and this delays him some. As things turn out he never gets going over there now.
816,27,14,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2pNn3/2P1PP2/P2P4/1PQ1N1PP/R1B2R1K b - -',I don't want that black Knight on e5.
817,27,15,1Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2pN4/2P1PPn1/P2P4/1PQ1N1PP/R1B2R1K w - -',Nor do I want it on g4. Although d5 is a great place for my knight I can get my other one there if I really wanted to so I decide to use the knight rather than the h pawn because with the f pawn advance my king's defense is already a little loose. Besides ...e6 would immediately kick my knight away anyways.
818,27,16,1Bxe3,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/2P1PP2/P2PB3/1PQ1N1PP/R4R1K b - -',This also serves my purpose allowing me to bring my bishop to e3.
819,27,17,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/p1np2p1/2p1p3/2P1PP2/P2PB3/1PQ1N1PP/R4R1K w - e6',I don't like this black move in this position. I think e6 is better. I don't understand his intention; in this position the f5 square is more critical. Or so I think.
820,27,18,1f5,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pbp/p1np2p1/2p1pP2/2P1P3/P2PB3/1PQ1N1PP/R4R1K b - -',And you just know my opponent does not want to take with the g pawn at all and e6 may have prevented me moving f5. This is my first real bind on black's position and the rest of the pressure against the black king will come about because of this pawn.
821,27,19,1Qh4,b'r4rk1/1p3pbp/p1np2p1/2p1pP2/2P1P2q/P2PB3/1PQ1N1PP/R4R1K w - -',This is rather optimistic. Who can join the Black queen to assist? And it won't protect h6 at all after a rook lift.
822,27,20,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/1p3pbp/p1np2p1/2p1pP2/2P1P2q/P2PB3/1P1QN1PP/R4R1K b - -',First getting my queen behind my bishop.
823,27,21,1h6,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p1np2pp/2p1pP2/2P1P2q/P2PB3/1P1QN1PP/R4R1K w - -',Black's bishop is not very good rightnow and overall black is very passive. His pawns don't look all that good to me around his king. Perhaps he expected me to take on g6 but I have no desire to trade pieces in a position I felt was better for white.
824,27,22,2Rf3,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p1np2pp/2p1pP2/2P1P2q/P2PBR2/1P1QN1PP/R6K b - -',The rook lift. The queen will soon retreat and will have accomplished nothing other than helping white to prepare his attack.
825,27,23,2Nd4,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p2p2pp/2p1pP2/2PnP2q/P2PBR2/1P1QN1PP/R6K w - -',Now the threat is Nb3 as well as hitting the rook.
826,27,24,2Rh3,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p2p2pp/2p1pP2/2PnP2q/P2PB2R/1P1QN1PP/R6K b - -',However moving the rook to menace black's queen gives me the time to deal with the knight.
827,27,25,2Qf6,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p2p1qpp/2p1pP2/2PnP3/P2PB2R/1P1QN1PP/R6K w - -',Well I had hopes to use that knight but now I have to trade it against d4. If I don't I rather think black will if I counter Nb3 potential. I'd rather have his pawns doubled so...
828,27,26,2Nxd4,b'r4rk1/1p3pb1/p2p1qpp/2p1pP2/2PNP3/P2PB2R/1P1Q2PP/R6K b - -',The bishop is moving on the next turn anyways.

830,27,28,Qg7,b'r4rk1/1p3pq1/p2p2pQ/4pP2/2PpP3/P2P3R/1P4PP/R6K w - -',I had other ways of trying to broach the black kingside but I did not want to take too much time because I thought black might be able to muster a defense. I was rather pleased to find my next move.
831,27,29,2f6,b'r4rk1/1p3pq1/p2p1PpQ/4p3/2PpP3/P2P3R/1P4PP/R6K b - -',f6! It will ultimately win two pawns and put white into a won endgame. Black cannot take it because of mate on h7. So off go the queens but I know at this point I have won it's just a matter of execution now.
832,27,30,2Rxh6,b'r4rk1/1p3p2/p2p1PpR/4p3/2PpP3/P2P4/1P4PP/R6K b - -',And Black's king is trapped. 
833,27,31,2Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/1p3p2/p2p1PpR/4p3/2PpP3/P2P4/1P4PP/R6K w - -',Black knows what is coming. Or so I thought.
834,27,32,2Rf1,b'r3r1k1/1p3p2/p2p1PpR/4p3/2PpP3/P2P4/1P4PP/5R1K b - -',And here I make a pretty good mistake. g4 would have been much better. If g4 Re6 then g5 ensures the black king's doom after white's second rook lift. Black's other try against g4 would be ...g5; in that case white has Rf1 followed by Rf5 and mate. Black can delay matters a bit but g4 would have sealed things. Play continued...
835,27,33,2Rf3,b'r5k1/1p3p2/p2prPpR/4p3/2PpP3/P2P1R2/1P4PP/7K b - -',Now having missed g4 in the game when I played Rf3 in this position I full expected ...Rxf6 Rxf6 Kg7 Rxg6+ fxg6 Rxd6 and white is up 7 pawns to black's five and has a won endgame with a little care. Oh how much better was g4! But for some reason my opponent got fixated on the rooks that could double up on the h file (And I would if black did not take the pawn on this turn as black would lose immediately) and mistakenly moved his king to f8 into a rather basic mate.
836,27,34,2Rh8#,b'r4k1R/1p3p2/p2prPp1/4p3/2PpP3/P2P1R2/1P4PP/7K b - -',Another fun game. Hope you enjoyed it!

840,28,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',His knight go to c6. His idea will be play like chigorin defense with his bishop in g4 to stick my knight trying e5 ASAP.Anyway this is hard thanks to my bishop and pawn that overprotect e5. Besides Knight c6  has a problem the pawn in c7 is blocked and in these structures is important a pawn in c6 to give more squares to the queen and to keep the center.
841,28,4,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',I let my white bishop develop and consolidate my small but safe center.

Now Black can actually gain huge advantage with 26...Qc6! threatening mate once more and forcing the White pieces to scramble to save the King.
934,30,26,2dxe3,b'5rk1/pb4pp/1p4q1/2p1Q3/5P2/2P1p1P1/PP5P/R4RK1 w - -',? This seems obvious but 26...Qc6 was better. As long as Black is threatening mate on g2 he could take the Bishop any time!
935,30,27,2Qxe3,b'5rk1/pb4pp/1p4q1/2p5/5P2/2P1Q1P1/PP5P/R4RK1 b - -',Better was the more combative 27.f5! promising a forced Queen exchange (because of 28.Qe6) and a won game for White as a result.
936,30,28,Qh5,b'4r1k1/pb4pp/1p6/2p4q/5P2/2P3P1/PP3Q1P/R4RK1 w - -',? For some reason I just wasn't paying enough attention to the long diagonal this game. 28...Qc6 or 28...Qe4 were *still* better threatening mate now on h1. The text... basically doesn't do anything.
937,30,29,Ba6,b'3r2k1/p5pp/bp6/2p4q/5P2/2P3P1/PP2RQ1P/5RK1 w - -',? Not as strong as it seems because White can simply play...

941,30,33,3h4,b'8/p4kpp/bp6/2p5/5P1P/2Pq2P1/1P3Q2/4R1K1 b - h3',?! This doesn't seem to have a clear purpose. White needs to activate his pieces not push pawns.
942,30,34,3Qe2,b'8/pb3kpp/1p6/2p5/5P1P/2Pq2P1/1P2Q3/4R1K1 b - -',? Simply gives up the g-pawn--and the all-important initiative.
943,30,35,Qxf4+,b'8/pb3kpp/1p6/2p5/5q1P/2P5/1P2Q3/4RK2 w - -',Probably 39...Qh3+ 40.Kf2 Qxh4+ was better leaving the f-pawn in play to prevent nasty counterattacks down the f-file against the Black King. Now White can force the Queens off the board with 40.Qf2 leaving the game pretty much drawn as White probably doesn't have any way to break the Black defenses with a Rook for a Bishop+two pawns.
944,30,36,Qf3+,b'8/pb3kpp/1p6/2p5/7P/2P2q2/1P2Q3/4RK2 w - -',Again 41...Qh3+ followed by ...Qxh4+ would have been better. Black actually stands a chance of winning in that line due to his passed pawns but frankly I was relieved that I'd managed a draw and essentially played this move as a tacit draw offer (as after the exchange of Queens the're no good way for anyone to progress).
945,30,37,Qxe2,b'8/pb3kpp/1p6/2p5/7P/2P5/1P2q3/4R1K1 w - -',Forcing the drawn position anyway.

948,30,40,4Kg4,b'8/6pp/3k4/pppb1R2/6KP/2P5/1P6/8 b - -',?? Noooooooo. With this misstep the game is suddenly lost for White. Black has majorities on both wings and with no pieces left on the board he will promote eventually.
949,30,41,4Be6,b'8/6pp/3kb3/ppp2R2/6KP/2P5/1P6/8 w - -',Pinning the Rook and winning the exchange.
950,30,42,Kd5,b'8/6pp/8/pppk1K2/7P/2P5/1P6/8 w - -',All Black must do is keep enough pawns alive to queen one without letting the White h-pawn through. On d5 the BK protects e6 and as long as neither of Black's other kingside pawns move White has no way to get through.

953,31,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',b3 is an unusual move from White. It is either to support c4 or prepare for a fiancetto. I follow the usual plan of the Carokann and attack e4 with d5.
954,31,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',After the exchange usual development occurs white places a central pawn but this blocks their Bishop if they procede to place it at b2. Nf6 strikes at the centre defends d4 against the c4 threat and helps prepare the Kingside for castling. 
955,31,2,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/1P6/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',In my opinion the fiancetto is wasted and accomplishes nothing with d4 blocked. I further build the pressure on e5.
956,31,3,Bxd3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/1P1b4/PBP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',White offers an exchange I accept. A key strategy behind the Carokann is working towards a favourable endgame for Black so simplifying the board with the exchange suits my goals.
957,31,4,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/1P1Q4/PBP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',The only option for White doubled pawns would only consolidate their Bishop's problem. Nc6 is standard development.
958,31,5,e6,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/1P1Q4/PBPN1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',White enables Queenside castling but the Knight contributes little it does attack e5 but does not help defend the King. Nc3 is better White could retreat their Bishop to c8 and look for Kingside play or look to move to a3 once it is safe.
959,31,6,Qc7,b'r3kb1r/ppq2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/1P1Q4/PBPN1PPP/2KR2NR w kq -',White castles their King but Black's position enables them to quickly mount an attack on the Queenside. a3 is better and defends against Nb4. Black brings the Queen in to play this is a bit passive and is waiting for Rc8 Qa5 would have been more to the point.
960,31,7,Bd6,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/1P1Q1N2/PBPN1PPP/2KR3R w kq -',White develops to the Kingside – but the threat is on the Queenside Ne3 (with the aim of Nc3) is better. Bd6 does create a strong threat on the Kingside but again this was too passive Nb4 would have been better.
961,31,8,O-O,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/1P1Q1NP1/PBPN1P1P/2KR3R w - -',g3 blocks my Bishop but the real threat is all Queenside. Black loses momentum with castling there is a tenet of ensuring the King is safe before attacking – but there was no current threat to the black King! Again Nb4 would have been the best option.
962,31,9,Nb4,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/1n1P3P/1P1Q1NP1/PBPN1P2/2KR3R w - -',h4 is a blunder from White. h4 provides no benefit to White's position and the Queenside threat needs to be addressed.. Black finally starts the attack with Nb4 which threatens the Queen and Qxc2#.
963,31,10,Nxa2+,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P3P/1PQ2NP1/nBPN1P2/2KR3R w - -',Another blunder and the Queen is lost with a fork from Black's Knight.

Probably best white's move here is Nd2 but again Qf2 Nf3 and black has not won yet because of Ne5+. So a whole new line to explore.

1060,35,4,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',possibly a slight innaccuracy in move order I was thinking that I should castle before opening the centre however its not as though the centre is going to be blown open and even if it were white can always castle at the drop of a hat. instead playing d4 immediatly suggests itself the problem with castling first is that it leaves black with more options. For example black could now play ...e5 to clamp down on the d4 square and enter a common enough set up. this isnt paticularly concerning for white but weather 6...e5 is good or bad for black doesnt matter the point is that its better to play in a way that restricts your opponents options thus d4 immediatly should be preffered
1061,35,5,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',ok this prevents possible Nb5 ideas especially since the queen may wish to develop to c7 as well as preparing a later ...b5 break which may be needed to challenge the white centre 
1062,35,6,cxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/8/2Pp4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',black cant really allow white to get in d5 
1063,35,7,e4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/2PNP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq e3',gaining a space advantage and preventing black from getting in d5. Now white can makes plans based on a space advantage as well as plans based on targeting the weakened d6 pawn. Now white has a simmiler structure and play to that which is achieved in a Maroczy bind with pawns on both e4 and c4
1064,35,8,1Nc2,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PPN2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Be3 is another way to go but to be honest I prefer this approach sticking by the saying the the side with a space advantage should avoid exchanges. The knight can even be quite useful on c2 where in some cases it might play a role in watching over b4 and later down the track it might be able to redeploy to e3 if black ever plays e5
1065,35,9,1Qe2,b'r1b1k2r/2q1bppp/ppnppn2/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PPN1QPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I dont actually think this is the best move available but white has such a good solid edge in this instance that there arent really alot of bad moves to be made in the position. The thing is that blacks lack of space leaves him with no real counterplay white can take all the time he wants to calmly prepare moves like f4 b3 Qe2 Be3/a3 then followed up with doubling up on the d file and applying pressure against d6. Here I played Qe2 so that I could clear the way for a rook to come to the d file quickly whilst it also overprotects c4 and e4 plus it xrays the b5 square which makes it extremly difficult for black to effect any useful pawn break. Other moves like b3 or Be3 were also worth considering but I wasnt entirely sure if I wanted my bishop on e3 or a3 yet
1066,35,10,1Be3,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/ppnppn2/8/2P1P3/1PN1B1P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 b - -',I chose to develop to e3 because in the short term I can look to put pressure against the b6 pawn by following up with Na4.
1067,35,11,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/1bq1bppp/ppnppn2/8/2P1P3/1PN1B1P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Unfortunatly for black white has a solid grip over d5 and I dont think black is going to find any way to get in ...d5 so it may have been better to keep the rook on a8 where it might have been able to assit with potential queenside operations since if black is going to find any kind of play at all it would have to be on the queenside even if it is useful to put a rook on d8 its better to use the f rook since black might want to use the c file at some point. To be fair it is difficult in this sort of position to come up with a viable plan for the blackside but if I were to have a go I would probably try making something happen on the queenside by considering moves that try to take advantage of the loose knight on c3 plans like Na7 with b6-b5 or Nc6-e5 followed again by a b6-b5 break even ideas like Rfc8 are worth considering if they attempt counterplay Nd7 is another possiblity that comes to mind it would protect  b6 and also allow the bishop to come to c6 which seems like a better place than passivly sitting on e7. I think probably Na7 or Nd7 are blacks best shots here the problem is that these plans require alot of tempi to implement and in that time the whole dynamics of the position could very easily have changed
1068,35,12,1Na4,b'3r1rk1/1bq1bppp/ppnppn2/8/N1P1P3/1P2B1P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 b - -',With the threat of a squer this seemed too good to resist but looking back I'm not sure it gains a whole lot after black responds with Nd7. F4 was proberly a better move gaining more space and depriving black use of the e5 square or maybe Rad1 was also a better move
1069,35,13,1Qb8,b'1q1r1rk1/1b2bppp/ppnppn2/8/N1P1P3/1P2B1P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 w - -',?? Nd7 was forced. After Nd7 white has a slight edge but its only that a slight edge black could then still cause white alot of headaches.
1070,35,14,1Bxb6,b'1q1r1rk1/1b2bppp/pBnppn2/8/N1P1P3/1P4P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 b - -',Now with the loss of the b pawn black will find it a whole lot harder to dig up counter play
1071,35,15,1Rd7,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbppp/pBnppn2/8/N1P1P3/1P4P1/P1N1QPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Seems natural to attempt to double up on the d file but its unlikely black will be allowed to get in d5 so the rook might have been better on c8. But then perhaps the idea is to try hold everything together and leave it up to white to find a winning plan afterall blacks position although cramped is still quite solid. it might not be that easy to find a breakthrough
1072,35,16,1Rad1,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbppp/pB1ppn2/4n3/2P1P3/1PN3P1/P1N1QPBP/3R1RK1 b - -',whenever pieces are left undefended there is the possibility that there are tactics to be found. I had been thinking of getting my bishop to a3 and so played this so that I could play Be3 and resopond to a knight attacking it by simply dropping back to c1 (then on to a3) and not have to be dissrupting the communications between my rooks. As it is this is simply a mistake because by leaving my bishop hanging out to dry black can now play 17...Nxe4! or Bxe4
1073,35,17,1Ng6,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbppp/pB1ppnn1/8/2P1P3/1PN3P1/P1N1QPBP/3R1RK1 w - -',fortunatly black missed it ...Nxe4 was the way to go
1074,35,18,h5,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbpp1/p2ppnn1/7p/2P1P3/1PN1B1P1/P1N1QPBP/3R1RK1 w - h6',This wont lead to much but black is looking for counterplay and its easy to understand lashing out like this. I'm not sure what to suggest for black maybe something like ...a5 with Ba6 to follow is one way to go or maybe instead black can still try making use of the c file with Rc8
1075,35,19,1Bc1,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbpp1/p2ppnn1/7p/2P1P3/1PN3P1/P1N1QPBP/2BR1RK1 b - -',The main move to consider is probably f4 I felt that it couldnt be prevented and since there are no threats and black has no real counterplay I can organise my pieces however I want well taking as much time as I want to do so. 
1076,35,20,2Rd4,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbpp1/p2ppnn1/8/2PRP2p/1PN3P1/P1N1QPBP/2B2RK1 b - -',Still f4 is probably the move to play however I still think it cant be prevented and in the mean time I'm happy to double up or poetentially even tripple on the d file bring my bishop to a3 maybe look at brining my knight to e3 and applying plenty of pressure against d6. Somewhere in that lot of moves f4 would probably be considered as well. The reason I played here is because I wanted to goad black into playing the positional blunder of ...e5? which would leave a hole on d5 which could be well made use of by Ne3 as well as that my rook cant be hit by a knight from this square and if black does play ...e5 then his knight would also lose access to e5 
1077,35,21,e5,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbpp1/p2p1nn1/4p3/2PRP3/1PN3P1/P1N1QPB1/2B2RK1 w - -',? this move is a mistake and is basically commiting positional suicide. Black wasnt thinking about the consequences and only made the move for a silly one move attack against my rook when really it accomplished nothing except to worsen blacks position. At this point white should have a big plus probably it is just a matter of technique now 
1078,35,22,2Rd3,b'1q3rk1/1b1rbpp1/p2p1nn1/4p3/2P1P3/1PNR2P1/P1N1QPB1/2B2RK1 b - -',After this move I think black realised that ...e5 had been a poor move
1079,35,23,2Ba3,b'1qbr2k1/3rbpp1/p2p1nn1/4p3/2P1P3/BPNR2P1/P1N1QPB1/3R2K1 b - -',Of course I was only concerned about applying more pressure to d6 but a quick pause mught have made me realise that Bh3 was worth considering. the point is that blacks LSB is his only piece that is kind of good whereas my LSB is my only piece that isnt that good. so exchanging my good bishop for his bad bishop usually is a good idea in this case the backward d pawn and subsequent hole on d5 make Bh3 all the more appealing  
1080,35,24,2Ne3,b'1qbr2k1/1r2bpp1/p2p1nn1/4p3/2P1P3/BPNRN1P1/P3QPB1/3R2K1 b - -',whites complete domination of d5 is really quite picturesque. White can still afford to spend loads of time placing the pieces on their ideal squares since black has no counterplay whatsoever. 
1081,35,25,2d5,b'1qbr2k1/1r2bpp1/p4nn1/3pp3/2P1P3/BPNRN1P1/P3QPB1/3R2K1 w - -',either a complete miscalulation or misguided pawn sacrafice. this simply loses a pawn whilst gaining no compenation for the deal white still retains the advantages except now I have another extra pawn. ...Ne8 seems to be the best try at holding the position together from there maybe black can try to play Be6 and Rbd7 and try to hold on or maybe black can try to get in f5 with something like Nf8 with g6/f5 and possibly even N-g8-e6-d4 in any case I think still shouldnt have too much difficulty winning though possibly white would first look to exchange bishops with Kh2 and Bh3 then either plant a knight on d5 and seek an attack somewhere or apply more pressure to d6 by playing to f5 with the knight
1082,35,26,Nexd5,b'1qbr2k1/1r3pp1/p4n2/3np3/2P1P3/1P1RN1P1/P3QPB1/3R2K1 w - -',forced

1084,35,28,3c5,b'1q1r2k1/4rpp1/p7/2PPpb2/8/1P2R1P1/P3QPB1/3R2K1 b - -',getting the passers rolling and also attacking the loose pawn on a6
1085,35,29,3Qb5,b'3r2k1/4rpp1/p7/1qPPpb2/8/1P2R1P1/P3QPB1/3R2K1 w - -',the game is lost anyway but maybe black should have tried to keep queens on
1086,35,30,Rb8,b'1r4k1/4rpp1/8/1pPP1b2/3RpP2/1P2R1P1/P5B1/6K1 w - -',seems sort of trappy possibly hoping I'd play Bxe4?? but if black wants to put up the most resistance then piece activity is very important Ra8 was probably a better try
1087,35,31,3Kf2,b'1r4k1/4rpp1/8/1pPP1b2/3RpP2/1P2R1P1/P4KB1/8 b - -',Now Bxe4 is threatened since after ...Rbe8 my king can come in to f3
1088,35,32,4c6,b'4k3/8/2PP2p1/8/1p3P2/1P3K2/P7/8 b - -',Anyway hope you enjoyed going through the game I know I enjoyed playing it. Its these sort of games that I find the most fun to be on the winning side of. I thought this was an excellent example of how to not allow counterplay and playing calmly by simply getting your pieces to good squares and not rushing to make things happen.
1089,36,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I open conventionally.
1090,36,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sometimes he'll respond with the King's Pawn Game but he usually plays the Sicilian against me.   
1091,36,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Of course I am going into the Opening Variation.
1092,36,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! After that I decide to bring out my LSB.  Luckily for me I don't have to fianchetto it.  6.Bd3 was also possible but my goal is to keep his f7 pawn pinned in this position.  However this move is dubious and inaccurate because he will simply kick it with 6...d5.  
1093,36,4,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Losing tempo does not stop me from keeping his pawn pinned.  Now it would have been a different story had he played 6...d5?  However that would have been a mistake because of 7.exd5 losing a pawn.  Why?  Because if then 7...Nxd5?? 8.Nxd5 loses a piece.  Afterall he would not be able to recapture with 8...Qxd5?? due to my LSB.
1094,36,5,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/1b2pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',In the meantime he decides to fianchetto his LSB.  Now people have told me in the club that you want to establish the longest diagonal with your bishop but that person was not Jack.  In addition as I have repeated in a couple of annotations you don't want to fianchetto your bishop unless it is the only way to develop.  Therefore I believe that 7...Bd7! was best.  Consequently I feel that he has a weakness due to that inaccuracy.  However that is not the case.  As we will see shortly there is a lot that he can do in this position.
1095,36,6,O-O,b'rn1qkb1r/1b2pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',? At this point I decide to castle.  Afterall I was planning to do this ASAP because part of development and center control is that.  However this is my first mistake.  Why?  It gives away a pawn.  Therefore best was 8.f3 as 8.Qf3 also loses a pawn.  How will he take the pawn?  With 8...Nxe4 and this is a move that I had overlooked.  
1096,36,7,1Be3,b'rn1qkb1r/4pppp/p2p4/1p6/3Nb3/1B2B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Despite the mistake I am still determined to continue with development.  However Jack told me that this was not the best move but he also said that we have to see what plays out as this is very interesting.
1097,36,8,1e5,b'rn1qkb1r/5ppp/p2p4/1p2p3/3Nb3/1B2B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq e6',And he decides to kick my Knight.  So how can I protect it and what are my options?  In this position 11.Ne2 is my only move as anything else loses my Knight.  Note: 11.Nb3 WOULD HAVE BEEN the only other safe spot but is completely out of the question due to my LSB on that square.
1098,36,9,Qf6,b'rn2kb1r/5ppp/p2p1q2/1p2p3/4b3/1B2B3/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',In this position he is determined to develop Queenside.  But I do not know why he would bring his Queen out before the other pieces.  Afterall he is not the Master Mater or one that would typically go out of principle like this. 
1099,36,10,1Ng3,b'rn2kb1r/5ppp/p2p1q2/1p2p3/4b3/1B2B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"! Therefore I decide to take advantage by kicking his bishop and he said ""this is a very good move.""  That is why I marked it with an exclamation point."
1100,36,11,1Bb7,b'rn2kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p1q2/1p2p3/8/1B2B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',So he retreats it back to the starting square of his Fianchetto.  
1101,36,12,1Nh5,b'rn2kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p1q2/1p2p2N/8/1B2B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"?! But I figured that this move gives me an advantage as I am now attacking his Queen.  What is my goal and what am I trying to accomplish?  In this position I am trying to gain tempo in order to punish him for going out of principle.  Where did I get that idea from?  When cdeburca said ""A good example of how to punish poor opening play.""  Of course however his opening was not weak.  In addition 11...Qf6 was not a mistake but rather an inaccuracy.  On the other hand this move is also inaccurate and a waste of time.  With my choice I lose and he gains what I was essentially trying to take away from him."
1102,36,13,1Ng3,b'rn2kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/8/1B2B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Therefore I should have just left my N on this square. 
1103,36,14,1Nd7,b'r3kb1r/1b1n1ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/8/1B2B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',After I pull back he completes development on the left wing (Queenside).
1104,36,15,1Qd2,b'r3kb1r/1b1n1ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/8/1B2B1N1/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',But that is not going to stop me from completing development controlling the center and connecting my rooks.  
1105,36,16,1Nf6,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p1nq1/1p2p3/8/1B2B1N1/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',I understand that Mr. Stockel has a plan as we will see shortly but I view this as an inaccuracy as he moved one of his Knights more then once before completing development.  Of course maybe he intentionally did this to test me because testing people is one of his styles of teaching. 
1106,36,17,1c4,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p1nq1/1p2p3/2P5/1B2B1N1/PP1Q1PPP/R4RK1 b kq c3',In the meantime I decide to attack his b pawn in an attempt to force an exchange.
1107,36,18,1Ne4,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/2P1n3/1B2B1N1/PP1Q1PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',"And this is his plan.  In addition we can infer that this is also a test as I mentioned on move 15.  Afterall he decides to fork my N and Q or did he?  Well as cdeburca told me in my previous annotation against this same opponent it's not a good idea to describe this as ""a forking move"".  In this position I have a couple of options like moving my Q to d3 which was btw my first instinct.  However if 17.Qd3?? 17...Nxg3 18.fxg3 Qxg3 losing another pawn and opening up my K.  So more then likely that move would eventually lose the game as the K would be very vulnerable to exposure.  However I thought of another alternative.  What is that?  17.Nxe4 which is the best move.  And that is met by 17...Qxe4 so this is not an effective fork.  In addition the alternative would pass his test with flying color!  "
1108,36,19,1f3,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p4/1p2p3/2P1q3/1B2BP2/PP1Q2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',Now things are very interesting.  In this position he is actually threatening mate in one 18...Qxg2#.  Here's the thing however like my first loss against the Master Mater I almost missed this threat and for the exact same reason.  That's right I was actually thinking of and was just about to play 18.Bc2?? attacking his WQ.  But if I played that mate would be inevitable.  So I looked at this move which also kicks his Q but I did not base my decision on that.  My only goal is to prevent the mating move. 
1109,36,20,1Qg6,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/2P5/1B2BP2/PP1Q2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',So black retreats his Q back to where he attacked my N.
1110,36,21,1Bc2,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2p2q1/1p2p3/2P5/4BP2/PPBQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',But I now have the opportunity to attack his Q with the same piece and in the exact same way without it resulting in mate.  So I basically achieve my goal without any drawbacks.
1111,36,22,1Qe6,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2pq3/1p2p3/2P5/4BP2/PPBQ2PP/R4RK1 w kq -',! He also could have played 19...Qf6 but I just reattack with 20.Bg5.  So this is best.   
1112,36,23,2cxb5,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p2pq3/1P2p3/8/4BP2/PPBQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq -',Now that he is safe I decide to force an exchange which was another goal that I am going to achieve.

Until recently I had no idea but it turns out that better was 22.Rfd1.  Why?  Last week I learned that it is not a good idea to put both rooks on the same color as it could lead to a fork.  I did not know that until the game was over so how and when did I learn this infromation?  Believe it or not there are two other members in the club besides Jack Stockel and me.  One of those people have the same rating as my chess coach and he showed an interesting game.  It was then that Jack told me not to place two rooks on the white squares if you're white and on the first rank; or both rooks on the black squares if you're black and on the eighth rank.
1116,36,27,2Be7,b'r3k2r/1b1qbppp/3p4/1p2p3/8/1B2BP2/PP1Q2PP/3R1RK1 w kq -',In this position black is completing development and this is the only way for Jack to develop his DSB immediately.
1117,36,28,2Bd5,b'r3k2r/1b1qbppp/3p4/1p1Bp3/8/4BP2/PP1Q2PP/3R1RK1 b kq -',In the meantime I am determined to force an exchange because after we swap bishops his Rook gets attacked.  Why did I want to attack his Rook?  Because he is attacking my a pawn.  So my goal is to put him under pressure before I permanently protect it with a3.
1118,36,29,O-O,b'r4rk1/3qbppp/3p4/1p1Qp3/8/4BP2/PP4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',?! Although my intention wasn't a waste of time it was pointless because he protects by castling Kingside.  BTW in this position this move is better then ...0-0-0 as castling Queenside initially leaves the King too open.  Now that the pressure is off I either have to protect it with my R or advance my a pawn.  However I prefer 25.a3.  That ensures that I did not move the R away from a1 for nothing.  In other words it ascertains that 22.Rad1 was not a waste of time.
1119,36,30,Rac8,b'2r2rk1/3qbppp/3p4/1p1Qp3/8/P3BP2/1P4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',I do not know why black played this but we can infer that he is hoping for an exchange in this position. 
1120,36,31,2Rdc1,b'2r2rk1/3qbppp/3p4/1p1Qp3/8/P3BP2/1P4PP/2R2RK1 b - -',"But that's what he's going to get.  Before I made this move I spoke to him about exchanging Rooks.  I told him that I did not like it because I am still behind a pawn.  He said ""Sure you can play that.""  I feel that this move also benefits my position as it alleviates some pressure.  Note: His Left Wing Rook (or Rook closer to the Q was and is the only thing that's causing me stress.)  In that some moves that benefit your opponent's position might also benefit your own position.  It's a similar idea to and in this case will become an even exchange."
1121,36,32,Rb8,b'1r4k1/3qbppp/3p4/1p1Qp3/8/P3BP2/1P4PP/2R3K1 w - -',I know what he really wants.  In this position he is trying to put pressure on the b file.  Here's the thing he is eventually hoping to exchange pawns with axb4 ...Rxb4 which would leave my b2 pawn attacked.  This time however that does not bother me as I will have none of it.
1122,36,33,2Bc5,b'1r4k1/3qbppp/3p4/1pBQp3/8/P4P2/1P4PP/2R3K1 b - -',So I decide to play this a big moment and break for me.  Normally you would ask yourself this question.  Why did Joe give away a free piece?  As it turns out however that is not the case as my B is protected by the Q.  Consequently if 28...dxc5?? 29.Qxd7.  Of course he is not going to make that blunder and I kept that in mind just before making the decision.  As a result my choice prevents him from playing 28...b4 which is why I played this.  Therefore I no longer have to worry about the b file.
1123,36,34,2g6,b'1r4k1/3qbp1p/3p2p1/1pBQp3/8/P4P2/1P4PP/2R3K1 w - -',Ok I do not know what he was thinking with.  It opens up his King and since it's not an endgame the K should not be opened.  Therefore I spoke to Jack about this move and he told me that there is nothing wrong with it. 
1124,36,35,2Rd1,b'1r4k1/3qbp1p/3p2p1/1pBQp3/8/P4P2/1P4PP/3R2K1 b - -',This is an ok move but I had originally played 29.Rb1 before we looked at the situation.  However Mr. Stockel showed me why 29.Rb1?? loses immediately. 29...Qf5 which eventually leads to a powerful fork and significant loss of material especially if then 30.Ra1.  He then told me that there was only one other move that was better then this.  However I did not know why it was better then what I just played.  In addition I had two instincts this move or 29.Rb1??.  On the other hand this was my first instinct.  Note: It's not always about finding the best move as someone once told me in a different annotation but rather making a good choice that works for you.
1125,36,36,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/3qbp1p/3p2p1/1pBQp3/8/P4P2/1P4PP/3R2K1 w - -',He told me that since the d file is under pressure he had to make this move.  Therefore my B is now attacked as 30...dxc5 is now feasible if I'm not careful.
1126,36,37,3Bb4,b'3r2k1/3qbp1p/3p2p1/1p1Qp3/1B6/P4P2/1P4PP/3R2K1 b - -',So I have a couple of options to protect my piece and I spoke to my opponent about the options.  He told me that this is best.  With any other move the pressure is completely off which leaves many open lines available for black.  In other words he would have a significant edge if I were to move my B anywherelse because his Q would start attacking immediately. 
1127,36,38,3Kg7,b'3r4/3qbpkp/3p2p1/1p1Qp3/1B6/P4P2/1P4PP/3R2K1 w - -',Now he decides to move his K.
1128,36,39,3Kf2,b'3r4/3qbpkp/3p2p1/1p1Qp3/1B6/P4P2/1P3KPP/3R4 b - -',"So I talk to him about this move.  Since his K moved before an endgame I asked him if it was safe to use my K as a weapon.  And he said ""There's nothing wrong with this move."""
1129,36,40,3h5,b'3r4/3qbpk1/3p2p1/1p1Qp2p/1B6/P4P2/1P3KPP/3R4 w - h6',Meanwhile he starts advancing his pawns.  In my opinion it's not because he's interested in promoting.  Instead he just wants to leave more options available for his WK.  Note: ...Kh6 is a feasibility because of this move.
1130,36,41,3Ke3,b'3r4/3qbpk1/3p2p1/1p1Qp2p/1B6/P3KP2/1P4PP/3R4 b - -',But I will continue to keep my K working as it can and will leave other options for attack.
1131,36,42,3Kf6,b'3r4/3qbp2/3p1kp1/1p1Qp2p/1B6/P3KP2/1P4PP/3R4 w - -',"And so will he.  His main goal is to eventually achieve the ""Opposition"" in this position.  I know because I have played many games against him and he often achieves that.  In fact he's the one who taught me about the kings being opposite of each other."
1132,36,43,3f4,b'3r4/3qbp2/3p1kp1/1p1Qp2p/1B3P2/P3K3/1P4PP/3R4 b - -',"In the meantime I am going to force an exchange.  Why?  Once his e pawn is off the board I am going to accomplish what he wants anyway the ""Opposition""."
1133,36,44,3Kxf4,b'3r4/3qbp2/3p1kp1/1p1Q3p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/3R4 b - -',! and nearly a !! move.  Why?  Jack told me something very interesting.  In this position I am actually threatening mate in one 35.Bc3# but that was not even my goal.  In fact I would have missed this opportunity which is why I did not mark this with two exclamation points.  My only goal is to get tougher catch up and stay in the game because I got overly paranoid about being in a losing position since I am still down a pawn. 
1134,36,45,3Qf5+,b'3r4/4bp2/3p1kp1/1p1Q1q1p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/3R4 w - -',"In this position my opponent said ""This is my only option"".  After I saw what Jack pointed out I looked at the board and he is absolutely correct.  Any other move could have resulted in mate which is something that he was not going to allow. "
1135,36,46,3Qxf5+,b'3r4/4bp2/3p1kp1/1p3Q1p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/3R4 b - -',Therefore I decide to exchange.  More often then not unless you are far behind exchanging Queens will often benefit your position.  How do I know?  I learned it from a different mentor in November of 2012.
1136,36,47,3Rd5,b'3r4/4bp2/3p1k2/1p1R1p1p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/8 b - -',After the exchange I move my R to the fifth rank with the intention to get a pawn back as noted on move 34.  This time I will achieve my goal as we will see shortly.  
1137,36,48,3Kg6,b'3r4/4bp2/3p2k1/1p1R1p1p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/8 w - -',In this position black's only goal is to prevent a check (so from 37.Rxf5 to 37.Rxf5+).  However that does not matter because I never intended to place him in check.  Instead I will simply take back a pawn on f5.
1138,36,49,Rc8,b'2r5/4bp2/3p2k1/1p3R1p/1B3K2/P7/1P4PP/8 w - -',He also could have played 38...Rb8 to protect b5 but that does not make a difference.  After I play 38.Rxb5 he will get something back as we will see. 
1139,36,50,Rc2,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/1B3K2/P7/1Pr3PP/8 w - -',And he will do so with this fork.  
1140,36,51,3b3,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/1B3K2/PP6/2r3PP/8 b - -',?? I had the option of protecting the b pawn or g pawn but I thought that it was completely irrelevant.  Why?  Either way one of those pawns was going off the board.  On the contrary it absolutely matters as this is the losing blunder according to my opponent.  Like always I generally have no idea why one particular move loses until the game is over.  As it turns out there is something about this move that takes away the coordination between my B R and pawns on the a and b files.  Coordination of material is absolutely essential and critical in a chess game.  With that in mind best was 39.g2 and the game might have ended in a draw according to my coach. 
1141,36,52,4h3,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/1B3K2/PP5P/6r1/8 b - -',After he took my h pawn was hanging so I have to protect it.  As it turns out this is the only way to do that.
1142,36,53,4Rb2,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/1B3K2/PP5P/1r6/8 w - -',After that he decides to attack my b2 pawn.
1143,36,54,4Bc3,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/5K2/PPB4P/1r6/8 b - -',But I will not back down. 
1144,36,55,4Rf2+,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/5K2/PPB4P/5r2/8 w - -',So he responds by placing me in check but I don't know why.  In my opinion better was the immediate 41...Rc2.
1145,36,56,4Kg3,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/8/PPB3KP/5r2/8 b - -',In response I decide to attack with my K.  Note: The K is a powerful weapon in the endgame.  Now this is what the weapon can occasionally be used for.  I actually won a game against an opponent by attacking with the K during an endgame.  Here's the thing that game happened a while ago and I was in a losing position.  That one move however turned a loss into a win.
1146,36,57,4Rc2,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/8/PPB3KP/2r5/8 w - -',Now black does what he could have done on move 41.
1147,36,58,4Bd4,b'8/4bp2/3p2k1/1R5p/3B4/PP4KP/2r5/8 b - -',"After the retreat I offer Jack Stockel a draw since it's an endgame and everything is even material wise (no one's ahead or behind) but he declines.  Jack said ""A draw?  You're too weak to hold a draw.""  By this he was not referring to my rating but rather the position. "
1148,36,59,4f5,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/3B4/PP4KP/2r5/8 w - f6',In this position I am pretty confident that black is determined to get a passed pawn either on f5 or h5.
1149,36,60,4h4,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/3B3P/PP4K1/2r5/8 b - -',But I am just as determined to prevent that.
1150,36,61,4Rd2,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/3B3P/PP4K1/3r4/8 w - -',So he takes advantage by attacking my DSB.
1151,36,62,4Be3,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/7P/PP2B1K1/3r4/8 b - -',And I respond by attacking his Rook.
1152,36,63,4Rd3,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/7P/PP1rB1K1/8/8 w - -',As a result he reattacks my WB.
1153,36,64,4Kf4,b'8/4b3/3p2k1/1R3p1p/5K1P/PP1rB3/8/8 b - -',? Now this is very interesting.  In this position I am planning a way to use my K as a weapon again.  However that's a mistake as it loses a pawn which I am not going to get back this time.
1154,36,65,4a4,b'8/8/3p2k1/1R3p1p/P4K1b/1P1rB3/8/8 b - -',Consequently I am planning to promote a pawn.  Sometimes you can turn a loss into a win by promoting a pawn but I am not going to be successful as we will see shortly.  Believe it or not I lost a game in a winning position when the opponent promoted and vica versa.
1155,36,66,4Bg5+,b'8/8/3p2k1/1R3pbp/P4K2/1P1rB3/8/8 w - -',Instead he places me in a very serious check.  Why?  In this position mate is almost inevitable so my only options are 48.Kf3 or 48.Kg3.  Either way I lose a piece when I'm already behind in material and there is no way for white to catchup at this point.  Therefore I resign.  
1156,37,0,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/8/2N1PN2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Pursuing my favourite scheme.

1161,37,5,dxe4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p2b2/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Interestingly white allows the queen's exchange keeping his knight. 
1162,37,6,Bg4,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BK1B1R w kq -',I threat BxN and then Nc6 Nd4 (once prepared).

1165,37,9,Nd4,b'2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2B1P/PPPB1PP1/R2K3R w - -',Black is more confortable already but the queenside is undeveloped. 
1166,37,10,Nxe2,b'2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N4P/PPPBnPP1/R2K3R w - -',The knight is doing well but a bishop's pair is a bishop's pair. It was calculated that it would have been tough for white to preserve the pair. 
1167,37,11,1Kxe2,b'2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N4P/PPPBKPP1/R6R b - -',Actually this helps white. 
1168,37,12,1Bd6,b'2kr2nr/pp3ppp/3bp3/2p5/4P3/2N4P/PPPBKPP1/R6R w - -',Better to develop the knight in e2 (avoiding the pin) but better to get developed the bishop first. 
1169,37,13,1Nb5,b'2kr3r/pp2nppp/3bp3/1Np5/4P3/7P/PPPBKPP1/3R3R b - -',Foreseen.

1171,37,15,a6,b'1bkr3r/4n1pp/pp2pp2/1Np5/4P3/2B4P/PPP1KPP1/3R3R w - -',No problem in opening the king's position. White is in no position to attack effectively.

1194,38,0,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3',So this is already something that I do not.  I always viewed this as a mistake because it is a non developing move.  As we will see later on that is sort of the point of this game.  And players like Fred can sometimes deviate from standard openings as I mentioned in different annotation.
1195,38,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',In the meantime I am just going to start developing as I do best.  This is a standard move according to this opponent.
1196,38,2,h5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/7P/8/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I am not sure why he moved there.
1197,38,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/7P/8/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But that is not going to stop me from continuing with development.  According to Fred this is still standard.
1198,38,4,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n1P/8/8/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',And he is still going to push but how am I going to respond this time?

Up until now I was following Expert IONS and Jack Stockel's style of advice by thinking ahead and calculating the positions.  By this move however I switch and follow easy19's advice as the position is starting to overwhelm me.  What is the masters style?  Well he doesn't think but lets things come naturally by knowing the best move.  I thought that I just knew.  I actually made this move because I thought figured I had won a free pawn.  That however was the logic behind 3.h6.  In fact this is why the game was called ""Walking The Plank"".  Afterall he walked one of his pawns to its demise.  However this is my first mistake.  He told me that best was 3...e5 here."
1200,38,6,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppppp1p/2n2n1p/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I understand the point of this move it is developing and will enable white to get his DSB out and give him more options with some of his pieces.  However I think that it is too little and too late in this position as white is behind in development or is he?
1201,38,7,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/2n2n1p/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',? In general you are not supposed to fianchetto your bishop unless it is absolutely necassary according to Master myevilluck my WTW mentor for that group.  However this would be an extenuating circumstance as it is the only way to get that bishop out.  But my opponent told me that this is another mistake.  The proper response was actually 4...d5.
1202,38,8,Nf3,b'r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/2n2n1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',In the meantime he is still in the process of developing.  But I feel that he is too far behind to do that.  However that is not the case as we will see later on.
1203,38,9,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/2n2n1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',"Therefore my decision is made to castle Kingside.  Afterall I like to castle ASAP in my games.  On the other hand he told me that this is another mistake.  BTW I mentioned that his first few moves were non developing.  Well here's the thing his goal was to try and get me out of the basic principals.  In other words he wanted me to disregard General Opening Principals.  I failed to because my primary goal was to develop as it is my comfort zone.  According to Fred best was 5...Ng4 or 5...d4 in this position.  In that he implied that the game is lost with best play.  I learned something from him.  What was that?  ...""i just make you abandon the principals of chess. and you will keep doing that as long as you do know them whiteout thinking"" is what he said.  So here's the moral.  Like real life it's important to be flexible and adjust to different positions in chess even if you are not comfortable with them.  It basically falls into the same category as the glass being half full.  But there is more to this game then meets the eye.  What else is there to learn?  The Master Mater also said ""practice practice prectise before i played my first real chess game i only played and learnt basics for about 2 years. things like how many squares are on the board. how strong is a rook on the b rank do i move a knight before a bishop and in what direction. do i play 1 piece twice or not etc etc..""

1204,38,10,Bxh6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/2n2n1B/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',Now he won back a pawn.  I actually thought that this was a blunder and would therefore lose a piece.  But I overlooked something.  After 6...Bxh6 7.Rxh6 so everything is even but as he noted earlier he has a winning edge.  The reason being is that after we exchange my WK is left more open then his K.  That openness is eventually going to expose it.
1205,38,11,b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pppp1p/1pn2n1R/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB2 w Q -',In the meantime I am just going to develop my LSB.  Normally I would have played ...Kh8 but what happens if I do?  First he brings his Queen to d3 which might not seem so bad.  But then what?  Second he moves his N to g5.  From then on he plans a mate so I was not going to take that chance.  Normally I would not have to worry about things like that but with this opponent you do.  As jstevens1 mentioned in a thread it is important to do your HW on this guy or he can really take you out.  I learned that from a different game against game and believe it or not that was the first game I lost to Fred.  
1206,38,12,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pppp1p/1pn2n1R/3P4/8/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB2 b Q -',So he attacks my Knight.
1207,38,13,Na5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pppp1p/1p3n1R/n2P4/8/5N2/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB2 w Q -',This time I find a safe place for him in this position.  That's right I will either lose this piece or it will get attacked if I place it anywherelse because if 8...Nb4 9.b3 or 9.Qd2.  Well there is one more option but I don't like it because 8...Nb8 undoes all the work that I spent.  BTW even if this wasn't the best move I have nothing to lose except for the game itself.  
1208,38,14,Qd3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pppp1p/1p3n1R/n2P4/8/3Q1N2/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',I know what's going on.  In this position he is starting to plan a mate.  At the time however I did not realize it.
1209,38,15,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pbpppp1p/1p3n1R/n2P4/8/3Q1N2/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 w Q -',So I decide to finish with development.  My goal is just to win a free pawn but that was never going to happen.  What else am I going to do?  I am in real trouble and when that happens I do things that I would not normally attempt like unsound aggression at this point.  Once in a while that has gotten me out of trouble.
1210,38,16,1Ng5,b'r2q1rk1/pbpppp1p/1p3n1R/n2P2N1/8/3Q4/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',At this point I now realize that black is totally lost but I am not going to give up yet.  Why?  Sometimes you can actually win or draw in a lost position if you really concentrate on the positions.  I just want to stay for as long as I can.
1211,38,17,1c6,b'r2q1rk1/pb1ppp1p/1pp2n1R/n2P2N1/8/3Q4/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 w Q -',Therefore I am hoping to distract him because I absolutely have nothing better to do.  When you know that a game is lost you can generally try just about anything even if it involves cheapo tactics.  Afterall this is why you are sometimes able to turn a loss into a win.  I actually did something like that in a different game where I was six points down and should have lost because I did played badly.  However I managed to swindle my around that when I deliberately gave up another piece to successfully deliver mate. 
1212,38,18,1Rxf6,b'r2q1rk1/pb1ppp1p/1pp2R2/n2P2N1/8/3Q4/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',So he decides to take my Knight and this is really a test.  Can I take his Rook immediately?  And why or why not?  In this position I have to be very careful in order to avoid the mate in one (12.Qxh7#.)  Therefore my only option is 11...Kg7 which completely exposes my King.  Any other move however would immediately guarantee mate.
1213,38,19,1Qg3,b'r2q1r2/pb1pppkp/1pp2R2/n2P2N1/8/6Q1/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',"Just because I avoided his mate in one does not mean anything.  He is still trying to find another way to deliver mate.  As chesskingdom64 mentioned ""There is always another way of doing something.""  However that is not going to stop me from taking this time.  Once again I have absolutely nothing else to lose so pretty much any move is as good or bad as any other."
1214,38,20,1Ne6+,b'r2q1r2/pb1p1pkp/1pp1Np2/n2P4/8/6Q1/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',So he decides to throw in a double and discovered check.  Very dangerous.  I actually thought that he would take my Queen with this family fork but he is going to do something far worse then that as we will see shortly.
1215,38,21,1Kh6,b'r2q1r2/pb1p1p1p/1pp1Np1k/n2P4/8/6Q1/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 w Q -',Now I only have two options.  The other feasibility was 13...Kh8.  However that gives him a mate in one on the grounds of 13...Qg7#.  So this is my only safe move.
1216,38,22,1Qg7+,b'r2q1r2/pb1p1pQp/1pp1Np1k/n2P4/8/8/PPP1PPP1/RN2KB2 b Q -',But that is not going to stop the inevitable.  That's right.  At this point I saw a mate in three so I resigned.  On the other hand he actually would have mated me in two.  14.Qg7+ Kh5 (forced) 15.Nf4+ Kh4 (forced) 16.g3#.
