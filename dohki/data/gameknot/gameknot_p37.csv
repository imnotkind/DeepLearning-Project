0,0,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So white starts off with the English Opening.
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Still in book.
2,0,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White develops.
3,0,3,Qh4,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P4q/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',As usual Joe is able to deviate from the guidelines and can get away with it due to his strength.
4,0,4,e3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P4q/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I don't know why white played this but Joe will now sac his Queen for a Pawn.  When he does white must be cautious because the weakest pawn is being removed after which his K is exposed.  Letting his guard will mean disaster.
5,0,5,h5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/2P5/2N1P3/PP1P1KPP/R1BQ1BNR w kq h6',Getting an open file for his Rook.
6,0,6,Kg3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/2P5/2N1P1K1/PP1P2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq -',I don't know why rrrrrrrrandom played this but I view it as a blunder.  By playing this his King is more exposed.  Instead I would've continued my development with 5.Nf3
7,0,7,Bd6+,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1pp1/3bp3/7p/2P5/2N1P1K1/PP1P2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq -',Therefore like we saw with my last annotation Joe punishes white for failing to follow General Opening Guidelines.  That's because black has developed a piece to place black in check.  When white gets out TA will use that time to get another piece into play.
8,0,8,e4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/3bpn2/7p/2P1P3/2N4K/PP1P2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq -',?? This however is where white goes wrong.  The idea was to fork black's Nf6 and Bd6.  So like what we saw with reversion's chess puzzle rrrrrrrrandom was hoping that Joe would overlook this threat which is why it's Hope Chess.  But in doing so white is going to wind up in worse shape.  
9,0,9,Ng4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/3bp3/7p/2P1P1n1/2N4K/PP1P2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq -',The reason being is that at the very least Joe will win back the Queen.  
10,0,10,Qxg4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/3bp3/7p/2P1P1Q1/2N4K/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR b kq -',While this appears to be better even worse would be 8.Kh5 8...Be7+ 9.Kh3 (forced) Nf2+ and with the family fork Joe would still win the Q.  But white would not get a piece in return.  However I think and TA can both agree that the game is still lost for white.
11,0,11,f5+,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2p1/3bp3/5p2/2P1P1K1/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR w kq f6',Causing more damage by placing white in check with a nasty pawn chain.
12,0,12,1Kg5,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2p1/3bp3/5pK1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR b kq -',My guess is that white wants to minimize the damage.  So he retreated as opposed to taking on e4.  However nothing is going to help white as the damage has been done.
13,0,13,1fxe4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2p1/3bp3/6K1/2P1p3/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR w kq -',So Joe takes.
14,0,14,1Nxe4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2p1/3bp3/6K1/2P1N3/8/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR b kq -',And white takes back whilst threatening to exchange.  Against someone of his strength or lower the plan might work.  But it does not against someone like Joe.  As now like that same puzzle with which I solved black has a mate in 5.
15,0,15,Nc6,b'r1b1kbK1/pppp4/2n1p2r/8/2P1N3/8/PP1P2PP/R1B2BNR w q -',As white I would resign here because of...
16,0,16,Ne7#,b'r1b1kbK1/ppppn3/4p2r/8/2P1N3/3P4/PP4PP/R1B2BNR w q -',This move.  The overall moral to this story is the same as that of reversion's blitz game.  That's because rrrrrrrrandom attempted to set up a trap but against a more experienced player it doesn't work.  Instead of trying to fork Knight and Bishop had white followed General Opening Guidelines and had continued developing he would've lasted longer.
17,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I had white pieces and started with e4.
18,1,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',After 5 moves we have sicilian scheveningen variation. 
19,1,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Be3 a6 we have transposed to english attack (kind of).
20,1,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Developing my lsb.
21,1,4,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black carried on with Bb7 adding more pressure to my centre maybe planning to play Nbd7 and then Rc8 later.
22,1,5,f3,b'rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',F3 defending my e pawn also prevents Ng4 in the future. 
23,1,6,g6,b'rn1qkb1r/1b3p1p/p2ppnp1/1p6/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I was hoping black to play Be7 then I would carry on with Bxe6 fxe6 and Nxe6 forking black's queen and g pawn. However my opponent responded with G6 which indicates that he is going to fianchetto his dsb then castle king side. 
24,1,7,1Qd2,b'rn1qkb1r/1b3p1p/p2ppnp1/1p6/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Qd2 preparing to castle queen side and then launch pawn storm on black's king side.
25,1,8,1a3,b'rn1qk2r/1b3pbp/p2ppnp1/1p6/3NP3/PBN1BP2/1PPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Now a3 safety first preventing b4 which could be an annoying move.
26,1,9,1O-O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/p2ppnp1/1p6/3NP3/PBN1BP2/1PPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',Everything went according to my plan. 
27,1,10,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/1b3pbp/p1nppnp1/1p6/3NP3/PBN1BP2/1PPQ2PP/2KR3R w - -',Frankly speaking I don't think this move is not accurate better move would be Nbd7 then Rc8.
28,1,11,1Bh6,b'r2q1rk1/5pbp/p1bppnpB/1p6/4P3/PBN2P2/1PPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',I could have played Qxd6 win a pawn but I decided to keep my queen to help the king side attack. Bh6 trading black's dsb (which is one of black's most important defending pieces).
29,1,12,Qc7,b'r4rk1/2q2p1p/p1bppnpQ/1p6/4P3/PBN2P2/1PP3PP/2KR3R w - -',This move makes sense connecting his rooks lining up his queen with my king also he can now bring a rook to defend his d pawn.
30,1,13,1h4,b'r4rk1/2q2p1p/p1bppnpQ/1p6/4P2P/PBN2P2/1PP3P1/2KR3R b - h3',Here it goes!
31,1,14,1Kh8,b'r4r1k/2q2p1p/p1bppnpQ/1p6/4P2P/PBN2P2/1PP3P1/2KR3R w - -',With this move black is now planning to play Ng8 protecting the weak dark squares.
32,1,15,1g4,b'r4r1k/2q2p1p/p1bppnpQ/1p6/4P1PP/PBN2P2/1PP5/2KR3R b - g3',My pawns are rolling.
33,1,16,1Qf4,b'r4rnk/2q2p1p/p1bpp1p1/1p6/4PQPP/PBN2P2/1PP5/2KR3R b - -',Qf4 provoking e5 so that black would have a weak d pawn.
34,1,17,1e5,b'r4rnk/2q2p1p/p1bp2p1/1p2p3/4PQPP/PBN2P2/1PP5/2KR3R w - -',And it happened.
35,1,18,1Qd2,b'r4rnk/2q2p1p/p1bp2p1/1p2p3/4P1PP/PBN2P2/1PPQ4/2KR3R b - -',Qd2. Retreating my queen also attacks black's d pawn.
36,1,19,2h5,b'r2r2nk/2q2p1p/p1bp2p1/1p2p2P/4P1P1/PBN2P2/1PPQ4/2KR3R b - -',I carried on with the attack on black's kind side.
37,1,20,2a5,b'r2r2nk/2q2p1p/2bp2p1/pp2p2P/4P1P1/PBN2P2/1PPQ4/2KR3R w - -',Black now launches his own pawn storm.
38,1,21,2hxg6,b'r2r2nk/2q2p1p/2bp2P1/pp2p3/4P1P1/PBN2P2/1PPQ4/2KR3R b - -',Hxg6 threatening mate in one.
39,1,22,2Qg5,b'r2r2nk/2q4p/2bp2p1/pp2p1Q1/4P1P1/PBN2P2/1PP5/2KR3R b - -',Qg5 bringing my queen close to black's king also threatening Qxg6.
40,1,23,2Kg7,b'r2r2n1/2q3kp/2bp2p1/pp2p1Q1/4P1P1/PBN2P2/1PP5/2KR3R w - -',Kg7 this looks kind of odd surely Qg7 would be better.
41,1,24,2Bxg8,b'r2r2B1/2q3kp/2bp2p1/pp2p1Q1/4P1P1/P1N2P2/1PP5/2KR3R b - -',Bxg8 before making my move I did think about playing Nd5 but instead I decided to trade off his knight which was a good defending piece. However Bxg8 turns out to be a mistake.
42,1,25,2Nd5,b'r2r2k1/2q4p/2bp2p1/pp1Np1Q1/4P1P1/P4P2/1PP5/2KR3R b - -',Now Nd5 attacking black's queen also with the intention to play Nf6+.
43,1,26,2Bxd5,b'r2r2k1/2q4p/3p2p1/pp1bp1Q1/4P1P1/P4P2/1PP5/2KR3R w - -',He took my knight without second thought.
44,1,27,Rac8,b'2rr2k1/2q4p/3p2p1/pp1Rp1Q1/4P1P1/P4P2/1PP5/2K4R w - -',Now black is threatening mate in one.
45,1,28,2Rh2,b'2rr2k1/2q4p/3p2p1/pp1Rp1Q1/4P1P1/P4P2/1PP4R/2K5 b - -',Pretty much forced.
46,1,29,2Qf6,b'2rr2k1/2q4p/3p1Qp1/3Rp3/1p2P1P1/5P2/1PP4R/2K5 b - -',Qf6 threatening Qe6+
47,1,30,2Rdf8,b'2r2rk1/2q4p/3p1Qp1/3Rp3/1p2P1P1/5P2/1PP4R/2K5 w - -',He definitely over looked Qe6+ the best move for black would be Re8 which prevents the check.
48,1,31,Rxf3,b'2r4k/2q4p/3RQ1p1/4p3/1p2P1P1/5r2/1PP4R/2K5 w - -',After Rxf3 I had to be very careful here I thought about Qxe5+ but I came up with a shocking move.
49,1,32,3Rxh7+,b'2r4k/2q4R/3RQ1p1/4p3/1p2P1P1/5r2/1PP5/2K5 b - -',Rxh7+! Tal mode activates. Now if Qxh7 Qxc8+ is coming. 
50,1,33,3Kxh7,b'2r5/2q4k/3RQ1p1/4p3/1p2P1P1/5r2/1PP5/2K5 w - -',Thus he took the rook with the king.
51,1,34,3Rd7+,b'2r5/2qR3k/4Q1p1/4p3/1p2P1P1/5r2/1PP5/2K5 b - -',Rd7+ forking black's queen and king.
52,1,35,3Qxd7,b'2r5/3q3k/4Q1p1/4p3/1p2P1P1/5r2/1PP5/2K5 w - -',I think my friend was too drunk to play at that point he played Qxd7!! Then he immediately resigned. The best move for black would be Kh6 then after Rxc7 Rxc7 black would end up with 2 rooks vs queen and would still have a chance. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did please leave your comments thanks for tuning in. See ya!
53,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The usual.  And as noted in my last annotation Erika plays the move that I recommended.  Now someone recommended that I teach students the Sicilian Defense.  The only reason I don't is because the master mater (easy19) said that I shouldn't because that is harder to learn.  The idea being is to start off with the basics and then as time progresses and the student improves that's when you teach more complicated things such as the Sicilian. 
54,2,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nothing new here.
55,2,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Although it's the most common move this is something new for Erika.  I have not seen my student play this before.  Usually she responds with Petrov Defense.  But @reachforgoals: This is actually the best move because it's most analyzed by masters and Grandmasters.  The idea is that you want play what they analyze the most.  The idea is that it leads to some well known lines which I'll discuss on his next move.
56,2,3,a3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/P4N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! This however is an inaccuracy.  Most common was 3.Bb5 (the Ruy Lopez) 3.Bc4 (The Guaco Piano) or 3.Nf6 the Three Knights Opening.  All three of these moves develop another piece for white right away.  And of them the Ruy Lopez and Guaco Piano allow white to castle safely at once.  The problem here is that sicliandrsgon isn't developing at all or advancing his d pawn to mobilize his DSB which also helps to control the center.  By doing so white has just waisted a tempo as black will use that time to develop another piece.
57,2,4,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/4P3/P1P2N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I'm not sure why sicliandrsgon played this but it is not the Caro Kann Defense.  Therefore this waists more time as we'll see with her next move.
58,2,5,h3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/4P3/P1P2N1P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Like before the time could've been used for white to develop another piece or advance his center pawn.  However he used it to advance a flank (edge) pawn.  In doing so Erika is much further ahead in development will get her K safety and is even closer to controlling the center.  It's hard to make any conclusion but I'd say that black has the initiative for now.  In other words I strongly favor black's position at this point.
59,2,6,g4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/4P1P1/P1P2N1P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQ g3',?! Maybe to get a pawn chain.  Not only doesn't this develop though but with this move castling short will mean exposing the monarch.  And as we know based on my recent game against Jack Stockel and what he's noted voluntarily exposing your K is a recipe for disaster. 
60,2,7,b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p3/4P1P1/P1P2N1P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',Fianchettoing so that Erika's Bc8 can come into play thus completing her development.
61,2,8,Ng5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p1N1/4P1P1/P1P4P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQ -',? Another thing that must be pointed as now not only is Erika much further ahead in development and center control but her opponent has moved the same Knight unnecessarily.  The idea being here is that in addition to what I mentioned unless there is a good reason for doing so you should not move the same piece more then once.  And that's something that two GM's have both emphasized including Susan Polgar.  The idea being you want all your pieces so moving the same thing more then once not only inhibits that but it also waists time as black will be able to complete her development.
62,2,9,Ba6,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/bpnb1n2/4p1N1/4P1P1/P1P4P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',?? However @Erika: This is your first blunder as white can win a piece here.  If this happens he will have the advantage.  With that being said how should your opponent proceed?
63,2,10,b4,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/bpnb1n2/4p1N1/1P2P1P1/P1P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQ b3',Unfortunately he did not.  @Erika: Best was 8.Bxa6 winning a piece at once.  But with your next move that opportunity is gone.  And I'm sure that's why you played 8...b5 which is good but it's important to be aware of how your opponent could've responded as that's part of being aware of threats made by your opponent which I mentioned after our training session.
64,2,11,b5,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/b1nb1n2/1p2p1N1/1P2P1P1/P1P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',! The threat was 9.b5 which Erika stops.  That move would've forked her Ba6 and Nc6.  Therefore white would've won a piece for a pawn after 9...Bxb5 (so that white wouldn't get a free piece) 10.Bxb5.
65,2,12,Qb3,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/b1nb1n2/1p2p1N1/1P2P1P1/PQP4P/3P1P2/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',?! And white has waisted more time by bringing his Q into play before completing development.  Sometimes you have to when playing against things like the Scandinavian or Domino's Defenses.  But in this case white did not have a good reason for doing so as better was 9.Be2 or 9.Bd3
66,2,13,Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/b2b1n2/1p2p1N1/1P1nP1P1/PQP4P/3P1P2/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',?? Although this move looks good it is a blunder Erika.  As it turns out he can win a piece for a pawn.  Can you figure out how?
67,2,14,1Qd1,b'r2q1rk1/p1pp1ppp/b2b1n2/1p2p1N1/1P1nP1P1/P1P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQ -',He missed it.  Best was 10.cxd4 and after 10...exd4 white is in better shape for the reason outlined above.  @Erika: So what's important to remember is evaluating each position and studying them carefully.  Remember: What looks good might be a blunder so it is very important to figure out what works or not and why.  
68,2,15,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/b2b1n2/1pp1p1N1/1P1nP1P1/P1P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ c6',While the idea is to exchange your Nd4 is still enprised (vulnerable) Erika which gives him the opportunity to take.  Instead much better was to get out of harms way by retreating.  Another important thing to mention as we also discussed in our training is that although it is minor a piece is a piece and therefore needs to be protecting.  In fact protecting a pawn is also important as my coach emphasizes.
69,2,16,1a4,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/b2b1n2/1pp1p1N1/PP1nP1P1/2P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R b KQ -',As noted before instead of developing white advances his a pawn adding to Erika's advantage.
70,2,17,1bxa4,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/b2b1n2/2p1p1N1/pP1nP1P1/2P4P/3P1P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',So Erika takes.
71,2,18,1Ba3,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/b2b1n2/2p1p1N1/pP1nP1P1/B1P4P/3P1P2/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',But instead of taking back white decides to develop here.  The only problem is that it's a little late as he should've done it earlier.  Instead preventing the loss of a pawn was more important which is when we must deviate.  With that being said best was 12.Qxa4.  But with this move Erika can liquidate and take away the opportunity for white to complete development here since the Bishop's will come off.
72,2,19,Nf3+,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/3b1n2/2p1p1N1/pP2P1P1/B1P2n1P/3P1P2/RN1QKR2 w Q -',?? I understand why you played this Erika.  You know that white has a weakness and thought it could be exploited.  But the other idea was keeping it protected from his c3 pawn  If his Queen and Ng5 weren't defending this would be ideal.  But the problem is that this is going to lose a piece for a pawn.  Best was 13...Nb3 gaining time in the process as his Ra1 is attacked.  It's important to that due to your a4 taking on b3?? would be an outright blunder.  The reason is that 14.Qxb3?? would result in 14...axb4  So the only alternative would be 14.Ra2 and with his Knight blocked on Nb1 he can't bring it into play.  What that means is that you're advantages are increasing due to his lack in development and center control.  But with this move the initiative gets handed back to white since a piece is worth more then any of the other things.  As an example this is why we deviate from General Openings if it means preventing the loss of a piece.
73,2,20,1cxb4,b'r2q1rk1/p2p1ppp/3b1n2/4p1N1/pP2P1P1/B4Q1P/3P1P2/RN2KR2 b Q -',Exchanging and still staying ahead by the equivalent to two pawns.  But best was to take the other way with 15.Bxb4 as now black is forced to liquidate even further with 15...Bxb4 and now 16.cxb4 or lose another pawn which winds up being the equivalent to a piece.  So with the variations and the reasoning this would've been better a move later.
74,2,21,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/p3p1N1/pP2P1P1/B4Q1P/3P1P2/RN2KR2 w Q a6',Going for another exchange.  
75,2,22,1d3,b'r2q1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/p3p1N1/pP2P1P1/B2P1Q1P/5P2/RN2KR2 b Q -',? In doing so not only does white get a pawn chain but more importantly (since in this position the concept is not important) he now has an outpost his Nb1.  In other words he can develop it.  Best however was 16.bxa5 and after 16...Rxa5 black doesn't get anything back yet.  By playing this she will win back a pawn.
76,2,23,1axb4,b'r2q1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/4p1N1/pp2P1P1/B2P1Q1P/5P2/RN2KR2 w Q -',That's because white cannot take back due to Erika's DSB.  So his next move is forced.  After this Erika will gain more time by reattacking the Bishop.

And she will achieve an open file which is very useful.  That is especially because she has a passed pawn with a Rook behind which as Jack Stockel and Susan Polgar emphasize this is very useful. 
78,2,25,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/4p1N1/1p2P1P1/3P1Q1P/p2N1P2/R1B1KR2 b Q -',In the process howeverwhite develops his Knight.

It's not easy to see but very possible in this position.  Better was 19...Rc8 or 19...Qc8  I would've played 19...Qc8 to keep Ra8 behind the passed pawn on a2.
80,2,27,2Bb2,b'1r1q1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/4p1N1/1p2P1P1/3P1Q1P/pB1N1P2/R3KR2 b Q -',Developing his bishop on the longest diagonal.  But better was 20.Nxa2 (winning another pawn at once.)  But even better (best) was 20.Nc4 as now you'd win two pawn by gaining yet another tempo.  So 20.Nc4 Bc7 21.Rxa2 as a likely continuation would be 22...b3 (hitting his Rook) 23.Ra5 (winning your e5 pawn).  Now you might attempt to refute this with 23...b2? in an attempt to promote but this would be another mistake as white would answer with 24.Bxb2 winning another pawn and after this he would be ahead by the equivalent to a piece.  Though I think that being 3 pawns down is worse then just a piece because we often use those pawns to promote.  
81,2,28,2Bc5,b'1r1q1rk1/3p1ppp/5n2/2b1p1N1/1p2P1P1/3P1Q1P/pB1N1P2/R3KR2 w Q -',? I don't know why my student played this.  But @Erika: This is a mistake because he can win another pawn.  Best was 20...Ra8

But best was 23.Bxe5 and after for example 23...Rb7 (to prevent 24.Nxb3 winning another pawn and forking your Q+R which would force you to prevent the loss of a piece by waisting tempo) white answers with 24.Bxf6! gxf6 25.Nf3 (leaving you with an exposed King.)  And having your monarch exposed is often a way to lose which is why this is important to note.
87,2,34,2Rbc8,b'2r2rk1/3p1ppp/5n2/q1b1p1N1/4P1P1/1p1P3P/pB1N1P2/R1KQ1R2 w - -',To minimize the damage should white play 24.Nxb3.  And to prevent the Rook from being attacked if white takes with 24.Bxe5

However Erika would still benefit but with this move however black will win the Queen for free.  And afterwards she will liquidate to add insult to injury.  Then she will use a passed pawn to promote and although white will take that promoted pawn he will lose a Rook in the process.  So with best play she has a forced win here.
90,2,37,d5,b'5rk1/5ppp/5n2/q2pp3/4P1P1/3PP2P/p2NK3/R7 w - d6',I think the idea here is to get another passer.  But his doubled pawns in the center will prevent.  So although major pieces have been exchanged in this particular position doubled pawns are beneficial for white.  That's because it keeps him in longer.  And with this move white gains tempo.
91,2,38,dxe4,b'5rk1/5ppp/5n2/q3p1P1/4p3/3PP2P/p2NK3/R7 w - -',?? Still trying to get a passed pawn and promote.  But @Erika: this is a blunder because white will get a Knight and pawn in return.  Instead you had to retreat.  And now I'm here to teach you something very important which I use Joe's (tactical-abyss's method).  Just because you've won the Queen doesn't mean that you're out of the woods yet.  You still need to be careful and not become overly confident.  Thinking that you're now going to win no matter what is a way to go wrong.  In fact my coach taught me that while annotating a game.  Plus there was a different game that I annotated.  The game was played before becoming a 900 rated player (actually having one of my lowest ratings.)  Now I started off with a Queen Knight Two pawns up.  Later on I blundered my Queen.  But with a near won game I thought that what I did didn't matter because I was going to win.  Well that attitude led to my downfall because she didn't just win back material but this opponent was able to promote and once she did I lost what I had left over.  This forced me into resignation.  And Joe gives examples more similar to this in his Q sacs.  That's because he sacrifices his Queen early and due to over confidence he still wins.
92,2,39,Qc5,b'5rk1/5p1p/5p2/2q1p3/4N3/3PP2P/p3K3/R7 w - -',"?? And this was also a blunder as black will win back your Queen Erika.  I'm not sure what your best move but just about anything was better then this.  In doing so you have thrown your win.  Doesn't mean that you're not going to win but you will have to work much harder whereas before it was an easy win.  And this is another reason why it's not good to become overly confident.  In doing so you have underestimated your opponent.  With that here's something else that my coach said when annotating the game.  That is the moral.  ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning position be very careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and losing the game.""  Although black is not lost this applies here."

95,2,42,3a1=Q,b'2r3k1/5p1p/5p2/2N1p3/8/3PP2P/4K3/q1R5 w - -',Black thinks that she has gotten a Queen.  But what Erika overlooked is white's next move.  However black will be the equivalent by taking with the N.  And while it appears drawish black does have a winning advantage.  However it's not easy and she must play accurately to keep it.
96,2,43,3Rg1+,b'6k1/5p1p/5p2/2r1p3/8/3PP2P/4K3/6R1 b - -',I presume that white checked to get a draw.  I think that he was calculating a draw by repetition but forgot that with her next move as with any other way to get out of check the position cannot repeat itself.
97,2,44,3h4,b'5k2/5p1p/5p2/2r1p3/7P/3PP3/4K3/6R1 b - -',There is nothing wrong with this move.  But I would've played 38.Rf6 (putting pressure on f6).  And as it's good practice let's reverse so that I'd be white.  So if Rf6 were played as black I'd respond with 38...Kg7 and from there we have a standard endgame.  I approached something like this in one or two games but I learned it as a similar position occurred in my favorite annotation of all time with more variations then any other that I've studied.  And a position like this was reached and one of the variations also led to something similar to what I just mentioned where the Rook goes after the pawn and the opponent defends with his or her monarch.  This is also important because it proves just how powerful your King is in the endgame.
98,2,45,3h5,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/2r1p2p/7P/3PP3/4K3/6R1 w - h6',Erika thought that white had a passed pawn and was therefore going to stop it.  Best however was 38...Rc2+ 39.Ke1 Rc1+ 40.Kf2 and now 40...Rc2+ leads to a draw by repetition.  But I think that black has something better which would win.  Such as 38...Rc2+ 39.Ke1 Ke7 and if we keep using the King the distant opposition (I believe) would be of a concern as now we have a dangerous fortress with black's monarch.  And I believe that we can use that fortress to get an eventual pawn chain which would guarantee a promotion.  Once again it's not a fact but I believe that this would happen.  And I'm doing some very difficult Homework by trying to think long term plans without analyze the board since visualization has also helped me to improve.
99,2,46,3Rg2,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/2r1p2p/7P/3PP3/4K1R1/8 b - -',I have no idea why white played but better was 39.Kf3 as the monarch is now doing a lot of damage because it allows 40.Ke4 Yes the position is now very similar to ...Re1 being the solution which would force a draw (as mentioned.)  But this time it would be the best case I think that white would win.  A possible continuation would be after that would be 40...Ra5 41.d4 exd4 42.exd4 Rd5 43.Ke4 Rd7 44.d5 Ke7 45.Kd4 Rd6 46.Kc5 Rd7 47.d6+ Ke6 48.Re1+ Kf5 49.Re7 Rxe7 50.dxe7 as now white would Queen.  
100,2,47,3Rc2+,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/4p2p/7P/3PP3/2r1K1R1/8 w - -',But Erika now goes for it with the move that I mentioned earlier.
101,2,48,4Kf1,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/4p2p/7P/3PP3/2r3R1/5K2 b - -',Protecting his Rook.
102,2,49,4Rxg2,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/4p2p/7P/3PP3/6r1/5K2 w - -',! So black decides to exchange.  In fact this was a good idea Erika because you're up a pawn.  And when you're ahead liquidating pieces is to your benefit as noted earlier.
103,2,50,e4,b'5k2/5p2/5p2/7p/4p2P/3PP3/6K1/8 w - -',? I presume that you were thinking about promoting Erika.  But what you have to keep in mind is that this isn't a passed pawn.  If it were the move would work but the pawn right next to it stops it.  And with that white equalizes.  So you have to ask how your opponent will respond and that is also very important.  Better was 41...f5 followed by 42...e4 with a very solid pawn.  And now when he takes on e4 you're still a pawn up.
104,2,51,f5,b'5k2/5p2/8/5p1p/4P2P/4P3/6K1/8 w - -',This is another mistake Erika.  And with that white should have an advantage.  With that being said what is his best move and why?
105,2,52,4e5,b'5k2/5p2/8/4Pp1p/7P/4P3/6K1/8 b - -',I presume that white thought that this was a passer except that he overlooked black's f7 pawn.  With that being said best was the immediate 43.exf5 and although not easy white should win.
106,2,53,4f6,b'5k2/8/5p2/4Pp1p/7P/4P3/6K1/8 w - -',? Now I understand.  You were trying to undouble your pawns.  But in this position your doubled pawns are of no asset and with this move he can still get a pawn and wind up ahead.  In fact although not easy to say from there he should win.
107,2,54,4e6,b'5k2/8/4Pp2/5p1p/7P/4P3/6K1/8 b - -',So best was 44.exf6!
108,2,55,4Ke7,b'8/4k3/4Pp2/5p1p/7P/4P3/6K1/8 w - -',Stopping white's pawn from doing any more damage.
109,2,56,4Kf3,b'8/4k3/4Pp2/5p1p/7P/4PK2/8/8 b - -',I think the long term plan is white getting the opposition.  The problem is that with Erika's doubled pawns it won't work.

112,2,59,4Kg2,b'8/8/4k3/5p1p/5P1P/8/6K1/8 b - -',At this point there are not a lot of playable moves for white.  So one move is as good or bad as the other.  No matter how you look at it though white can no longer win.
113,2,60,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/5p1p/3k1P1P/8/5K2/8 b - -',"At this point a draw a was agreed on.  But as ION pointed out black could have won this game.  In it he said ""Erika with the Black pieces agreed a draw at this point (I presume she accepted a draw offer). But she had an easy win from here as White was in a zugzwang and had to give ground. Black could have cleaned up: 

50...Ke4 
51.Kg3 Ke3 
52.Kg2 Kxf4 - Which simply could not maintain protection of the f-pawn nor the h-pawn if Black so wills it 

53.Kh3 Kf3 
54.Kh2 f4! - Black also wins by ...Kg4 and ...Kxh4 but I prefer this pawn advance 
55.Kh3 f3! 
56.Kh2 Ke3 - Also winning are ...Ke2 and ...Kf1. I prefer to move the K to the e-file [a] to leave the queening square f1 open and [b] to keep the WK stuck in the corner. 

57.Kg1 Ke2 - Not 57...f2ch?? as White can force a draw by 58.Kf1! Kf4 (...Kf3 is Stalemate!) 59.Kxf2 Kg4 60.Kg2 Kxh4 61.Kh2 ... after which the WK never moves off the 4 corner squares and Black can't force the h-pawn through. 

58.Kh2 f2 - Black has made sure the WK never got in front of the f-pawn. 
59.Kg3 f1=Q 
60.Kh2 Qf4ch - Black has to ensure that the WK alsways has a move available. So 
60...Kf2 or ...Kf3 would have thrown away the win (Stalemate) 

61.Kg2 Qg4ch 
62.Kh2 Kf2 - Now is the time When White has one move available. 
63.Kh1 ... Black can choose from three different checkmates.""  So the moral is not to just offer or accept a draw offer.  Instead you must play the draw out first.  For example in a different game against Jack Stockel (which I didn't restart annotating those games at the time) although it was even (material wise) my coach had a win.  However I thought noone could win so I offered him a draw.  But Jack declined by saying ""You're offering me a draw?  I don't have to give you a draw.""   And later he was able to force a win and said that you have to play out the draw first.   @Erika: As archduke_piccolo also told me remembering this moral will also help you to improve your overall games.

As I'll retreat on the most common square.

But even if he were to play that here I would not.  That's because tipsyjourneyman and I discussed it.  And we agree to an extent.  But one thing is for sure which is that against a stronger player (espeically a runner) I'll delay castling and develop first.  That's because John said that someone (he believes shamash) told him that castling should be used as the final step in development.  However even if I wanted it's not possible in this particular.  The reason is that I'd lose a pawn if I did that.

With that being said 6.d3 also came into consideration with a pawn chain.  But I like going into the exchange variation.  Just before this happens Jack will hit my Ba4 in which I'll get out of harms way by retreating to b5 which is what we typically see.

Although the position here is different the idea behind it is the same which is the gain of tempo since Jack will be forced to get his Nf6 out of harms way.  BTW that game started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Bc5 4.0-0 Nd4 5.Nxd4 Bxd4 6.Nc3 when 6.c3 was more common as everyonelse pointed out.  And what he said was ""This c3-d4 plan is quite common in the Ruy Lopez mainly in this position since it wins a tempo by attacking Bd4. No surprise it's what experienced players choose most. Note it also helps Bb5 to reach c2 immediately via Ba4-c2 in case it gets attacked by ...a6-b5.""  In addition I was worried about losing my e pawn but it was protected until I advanced it.  With that being said I'm not sure what the best move as here.  But in this particular position that plan was a mistake which luckily due to Jack's guacoma black doesn't spot.  But he can win a pawn with 10...Bxg2 and if 11.exf6 Bxh1 12.fxe7 Qxe7+ 13.Qe3 Qxe3+ 14.fxe3 not only liqudiating while being a pawn down but also losing the opportunity to castle short and losing as opposed to gaining time because my Bc1 remains undeveloped.  So I'd be forced to bring into play before castling long.  "

This is something I forgot about after presenting it in KOH club.  While I remembered the Homework I forgot about all else as it seemed irrelevant.  The reason is because I got the right answer but for the wrong reason.  But that same attitude and miscalculation led to this mistake which makes it important since we're talking about thought process.  Therefore I change it from just Homework to a quiz.  By my own standards I failed and unlike with other courses there are no retakes as the damage has been done.  This one however involved figuring out why black resigned.  The reason is that black would've lost a piece but I calculated the wrong variations.  And the teacher made a very good point because I thought it involved the Knight.  And it was with the same results that the pawn attacks it after which it's blocked and would be lost.  He said as part of the quiz before finding out it's Homework don't you think it can move elsewhere and he was quizzing me.  Well that same thing occurred here but now the damage has been done for real.  In other words I calculated on how I could win Jack's Nh5. Just when I thought I looked at everything and thought that black could not get out of this Jack finds the only way out.  And when he does I run into problems as we're about to see.

So I played this but it should lose my Queen.  Much better was 19.Rxf3 and if 19...Bxf3 20.Kxf3 and now it would take longer for him to mate because if 20...Ng5+ 21.Ke3 and he doesn't have an immediate sequence.  But with this move Jack can win a Queen but black does not take.  Instead he plays something much better which win even quicker for him.
135,3,21,1Ng5,b'r3k2r/1bpp1pp1/p7/1p2P1n1/7q/1BN2Q2/PPP3K1/R4R2 w kq -',And that is with this move as now he is threatening mate.  But this time I overlook it.

But I decided to make it look like white got greedy and grabbed the bishop.  That's because sometimes ""To take is a mistake""  And being greedy as noted would've led to this.  Instead I played 20.Qd3 which is actually an illegal move since my Queen is pinned.  I didn't realize it and due to Jack's glacoma and the absence of Bert and Tom he didn't notice it either.  Nontheless the next move is still the same.  So in other words everything else including the final blow was how all else was played."
137,3,23,2Qh2#,b'r3k2r/1Qpp1pp1/p7/1p2P1n1/8/1BN5/PPP3Kq/R4R2 w kq -',Jack: But isn't this mate.  Joe: Yes it is.  And he laughed as he usually does when delivering mate.  We reviewed it and played through variations.  But this time I must disagree with him because of one thing that just isn't possible.  In it he said that best was 20.Bf7+ as now I'm threatening mate.  So after this the only way to refute that would be 20...Nxf7 allowing 21.Qxf7+ Kd8 22.e6 d6 (as 22...exd6? would be a mistake) and after 23.e7+ Kc8  And the problem is that I didn't see any of it as an important to learn is seeing the opponents weakness.  However the line that Mr. Stockel gave me is unplayable because 21.Qxf7+ is also illegal and for the same reason.  As it turns out my Queen is directly pinned so it cannot move.  Therefore once I played 19.Qxf3 the only way to prevent this mate was giving up my Queen for my LSB.  But the best I was going to get was the loss of a Rook and pawn for a bishop after which he'd be in better.  The real problem occurred due to rushing and having unreasonable attitude which therefore exposed my King unnecessarily.  When that happened he was able to exploit my weakness.  From there things were only going to get worse.

Bg7 10. c3) was a much stronger play keeping the pressure on Black and forcing a bishop move and helping me dictate moves.  If you ever find yourself retreating early in a KGA then you have made a poor choice leading up to or in the move at hand.  Gambits are about exchanging pieces for fast development and attacks.  I took a timid approach and some future compounding errors will severely impact my position.

While it does help shore up the central pawns it cedes all initiative to Black.  Instead of dictating the flow (as White should in KGA) I am now reactive.

Black has the ability to reach deep into my territory with a rook at g3 so I need more pieces for defensive and counterattack options.  Rookie tip: if you're ever uncertain what to do and you still have power pieces in their starting positions get them in the game.  As a potential side benefit moving my knight would have potentially given me a chance to castle queenside and connect my rooks.  I can already feel this game slipping away.

1) KGA - if you're White it's still early and you're retreating you've done something wrong.  Look for ways to extend the attack!
2) When in doubt get your pieces into play.  Don't play pawn games when you need that extra power for attack/defense.  Finish that development.
3) When you have your opponent on the ropes don't immediately recapture.  Look at your options and see if there's another way to add even more pressure.
4) And finally queens make for a hairy endgame that can be tough to predict.  If you're  ahead consider trading them away to have more predictable end games.  If they are out of power pieces their ability to mount a comeback and few and far between.

In sum I made a lot of mistakes early Black almost capitalized and let me claw back and then I made a key blunder late in the game that robbed me of my shot at victory and by all rights should have cost me the game.  Not worthy of the rating in this game!  Well done madcsan."

On the other hand white has now the chance to expel BN on d4 if c3 is eventually allowed. White needs to exploit the narrow position black has on that area not forgetting to try something on the BK castling though.
212,5,16,1Bd2,b'r4rkb/pp1b1p1p/2nppPp1/q1p3P1/3nP3/1PNP2N1/P1PB2BP/2RQ1RK1 b - -', Sad and slow it seems but I didn't feel like giving up on my a2 with the interesting Na4-Nb2.

But then black is moving pieces away from the castling which makes me think about trying something there. The mate with N on h6 seems impossible but then maybe something with the rook... Question is... would it be worth trying the advance h4? Or perhaps  since black has not advanced e5 Rf4 is the appropriate move?
214,5,18,1Rf4,b'r4rkb/pp1b1p1p/2nppPp1/2p3P1/3nPR2/qPNP2N1/P1PB2BP/2RQ2K1 b - -',"I opted for the latter.

I guess in case of ...e5 black will have to give up on the center. That (not giving up on the center) may also explain why it was Ra and not Rfa8 played.

Moreover it cannot retire without losing the pawn on d3 and in case of Bxe5 dxe5 LSB will also have his c8-h3 blocked and therefore white can bring some firepower onto that flank to exploit BK weakened castling.
218,5,22,2b5,b'2r2rkb/p2b1p1p/3ppPp1/1pp1n1P1/3nPB1R/qPNP2N1/P1P3BP/2RQ2K1 w - b6',Nd-c6 was the other alternative but then the c file is blocked.

It was interesting that after 32...Qc1 33.Nd2! saved the day: it gives time for Rook to go back to h3 and at the same time is defending f1.

Hope you have enjoyed both!
232,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start of with my usual.
233,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',She remembered what I've told her including the fact that 1...e5 is the most common response.  I forgot when it was but I think it was just before our second training session where this student implied that she learned that from me.  
234,6,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I had anticipated 2...Nc6 as after we'd have the Ruy Lopez.  However there is nothing wrong with this move as it also develops.  BTW @reachforgoals: The Ruy Lopez is a well known opening that starts off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5  It is good to learn these different opening.  Though this can lead to other things such as the Four Knights opening which is going to happen.  My goal here is to try and have you become familiar with different opening and variations as it's good practice.
235,6,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I considered 2.Nxe5 with the idea being that after 2...Nxe4 I'd gain tempo and a pawn after 3.Qe2 because when her Ne4 would retreat that's when I'd play 4.Qxe5  But I don't know the proper continuation after that so I didn't want to go into complications.  Therefore to keep it simple I decided to just continue developing.  At this point the conversation begins.  Erika: I am thinking abut ethier mvoing the bisop to get ready for castle or the knigt.  if I move the bishop then pawn could be taking taking but if i move the knight i have a piece in place just case the other player takes the pawn  Joe:  Either one is good for castling purposes. One of the main things you want to do in general is develop your pieces and get the K to safety. The only thing to note about moving the B which is what you were thinking is that you generally want to develop the Knight before the bishop. The reason is that you know where to place but with bishops however it is a different story. And moving them away from the eighth rank doesn't lose anything.
236,6,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Following my advise she plays this.  And that makes me proud of her.
237,6,5,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',With that being said I continue developing and prepare to castle.  Erika:  I know this is off subject but can some one win a game if one player has a king and other player has a king and 2 queens.  I am only asking that. i was in a game that 2 queens and ask for draw becuase i was not sure if i could win that way. yes the draw was accepted.  Joe: Yes if played correctly two Q's and the K can win. In fact there are some games where just a Queen and King can mate against the King. The way to do that is confine the King to the corner so on the a and/or h files. From there it is in a place where it can't get out. However if you have those Queens but make a blunder the game could still end in a draw usually by stalemate but there's also 50 move rule where no captures have been made in 50 moves. Or there is a different mistake where you keep checking he or she gets out and the position repeats three times until you have a draw by repetition. But if everything is done right you would have a win.  When I said that however I made a mistake which I spotted out by visualization.  In fact I pictured a position just before I fell asleep on Monday night.  And I corrected myself and showed her that fen yesterday.  I got two Queens mixed up with Knight and Bishop which that must be in the corner.  But with two Q's and K against K the monarch being confined to the back rank is enough to mate.  So said in a pm I did make a small mistake on how to mate with two Q's and the K. In most endgames the idea is confining the monarch to the corner so on the a or h file in the corner. But with Queen's we don't need that. The best way to mate there is to force the monarch on the back rank so on the 1st or eighth rank. 
238,6,6,b6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Erika: bad moveo n myhaalf  Joe: It's not so bad. Sure it doesn't develop but this is a fianchetto and what it boils down to is if you have time to do this. Given that d7 hasn't advanced yet you have time to play this.  Now that I think of this as noted it isn't that bad. But slightly better was to advance the d pawn because the way to control the center is to dominate the center files which is the d and e files. However it's not a terrible move because as you can still develop your Bishop here.
239,6,7,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile I was going to castle one way or another.

In other words I did not play this to win material as one would think.  Instead I am quizzing Erika by putting her in this situation.  My goal is to see if she finds the right move.  The idea being is this student to learn since one of the weaknesses is missing threats which we'll see later on.  In this case the fear is winning a pawn and a major piece by forking her Rh8 and Qd8  I also bared that this is not that easy to spot.
242,6,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',But by following my advice on developing and castling she found the best move.  And that also makes me proud of her.

And in the process I have a solid pawn chain which in this particular position it's very beneficial especially since those three pawns are together.  It's thus important to note that if instead of d3 let's say that other pawn was on a3.  In that case I wouldn't go for the pawn chain as it wouldn't be as useful.  Meanwhile the training resumes.  Erika: when good time to use Conditional moves and when is i not a good time  Joe: You have to anticipate accurately. In general it's only preferred when a move is forced. But if there are other options then I wouldn't recommend it because if he or she makes a move that the opponent does not anticipate he or she could wind up in trouble. That actually happened to me in a game about 7 years ago and that sealed my fate.  Erika:  i need time tbeofre i make my next move that is not a good move c5 to to f2 nor moving the knight form f3   
244,6,12,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/ppn2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',After about a day and a half she plays this.  I understand the logic behind it because the plan behind it is 8...b5 which would gain a tempo and it would boil down to the same thing that would occur if black were to 7...h6  Joe: Always take your time before moving. One reason I set the time control to 14 days was so that there's be plenty of time. And you are right that taking on f2?? would be a blunder.  Erika: nor b7 to b6 nor h7 to h6  Joe: You are right about b7-b6? being a mistake as I'd take the pawn.  Although this is not bad you asked about 7...h6 In this case that was best because I'd be forced to lose tempo (time) which you be able to use the time to complete your development.
245,6,13,Bd5,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/ppn2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So I go for the gusto by putting pressure on her c6-b8 diagonal.
246,6,14,Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/ppn5/2bnp1N1/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',She takes.  
247,6,15,exd5,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/ppn5/2bPp1N1/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I take back.  Erika: we both loss the same amount of its fair  Joe: Yes but since it's even we haven't lost anything. It's actually known as an even exchange because everything remains even.  The only problem as you see here is that by taking on d5 although it's an even exchange I have gained tempo because I took back with my e pawn as opposed to the N.  Erika: how many days do have i need to fiand amove  Joe: The time control is set at 14 days per move. Given that it's only been a day you have 13 days. So take as much time as you need.  Erika:  right i as thiknking of saving the knight but it is just aminior piece  Joe: Yes but minor pieces are very important. The idea being is not to give anything away especially pieces.
248,6,16,Nd4,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/pp6/2bPp1N1/3n4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',So he protects.  And in a private message she asked me a good question.  Erika: when would you ask for a draw?  Joe: A draw is offered when you feel that noone can win. Now if the other side agrees with your assessment he or she accepts. But if the opponent disagress the offer is declined. However you generally want to play it out first. Meaning: You want to play until near the end and then if both sides are even and it doesn't appear that one can win that's when they generally offer a draw. The idea being is that early on anything can change.
249,6,17,1Qh5,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/pp6/2bPp1NQ/3n4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',In the meantime this is considered unsound so on a regular basis a move like this would not come into consideration.   But with Erika that is an extenuating circumstance because I know her weakness.  So I play this to help her improve.  Plus in a couple of her annotations reachforgoals missed the threat by grabbing her opponents R but overlooking a bigger threat similar to this.  In doing so her opponent was able to mate.  So my goal is to help my student learn.  Therefore as the saying goes unusual circumstances calls for desperate measures.  Although this isn't desperate everything else applies here.  And that is especially because of what happened in our last training session.  The threat was similar except that it involved my DSB and Queen as black.  However she missed that threat which resulted in mate.  Like before I am therefore quizzing her to see if she spots the threat.
250,6,18,1g6,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1p1p/pp4p1/2bPp1NQ/3n4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',?? I didn't anticipate anything from black but she overlooked it and played this.  So I said this loses Erica. You did mention about the loss of a piece which I said was important. But what I was threatening was even more important here that got overlooked. This allows white to mate.  
251,6,19,1Qxh7#,b'r1bq1rk1/2pp1p1Q/pp4p1/2bPp1N1/3n4/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',"Since I saw similar mistakes in her past games as noted I gave her Homework and was going to give Erika a little more time to study this.  The problem however is that I was going to annotate.  Now after today there wouldn't be time to annotate until Tuesday or Wednesday.  Normally that's allright except that this game lasted for almost a month.  So in two more days some of the game chat will be deleted.  And for learning purposes I wanted to get this annotation out before that happened.  Consequently I continued by saying The main lesson is as cplusplus11 puts it ""You have to be aware of all threats made by your opponent checks and captures."" For example the reason that you kicked my Queen was because it appeared to gain time since in general it would have to retreat. But there was an immediate threat there. So that had to be dealt with beforehand.  No good was 10...Qxg5 because although it prevents mate you'd lose your Queen for a Knight. Therefore the only way to prevent mate without losing your Queen was 10...h6 So this was forced (hitting my Ng5 as now I can't mate on h7 since that pawn has moved.) After that my next move would be 11.Nf3 and after for example 11...Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3 it would still be even.  Then I showed her that position and concluded by saying the other annotations where I witnessed that example was when you took a R but missed the threat which enabled the opponent to deliver mate. So remembering the moral on what your opponent is threatening to do seeing what's happening in that position and figuring out how to meet that threat will help you improve."

306,10,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Like many players Reuben likes the KPG.  And as you might guess yes this will become the Ruy Lopez.
307,10,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The most common response.  So I answer with the main retreat square on a4.  Obviously I won't take his Nc6 although it did come into consideration.  The reason I don't is because tactical-abyss has said that in the Ruy Lopez doubled pawns are of no asset since the major pieces haven't been exchanged.  Plus a B is worth more then a N here so I really need my LSB.
308,10,3,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I anticipated 4...b4 in which I would've answered with 5.Bb3  This move however is understandable as Reuben is getting one step closer to controlling the center by advancing the other center pawn so that he can bring his Bc8 into play.  In this case it's a little nasty because it will mean pinning my Nf3.  But before he can do this I will castle which is generally something that I like to do anyhow.
309,10,4,Nc3,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/B3P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The pin is of no immediate concern for if 6...Bxf3 I'll take back with my Q.  In doing so I think my position would be a little stronger which is why Reuben doesn't take here.

I also looked at the possibility of 7.d4 with the idea being 7...exd4 8.Nxd4 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 with a better looking position.  But I almost overlooked one thing.  The plan would not have worked because instead of 7...exd4 black could play 7...b5 and after 8.Bb3 I'd lose a piece for a pawn after 8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Nxd4 10.Qxd4 c5 as now my Q must retreat which would allow 11...c4  I remember due to a Homework assignment from stalhandske (during a consultation game) where I suggested a move that would've been a blunder for the same reason.  Then I made a similar blunder in another game so I wasn't going to allow history to repeat itself.  The real idea is learning from your mistakes.  But with this move I'm still preparing to complete my development and in the process I get a pawn chain (which is very useful). 
312,10,7,d5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n2n2/3pp3/B3P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I guess that Reuben wants to exchange.  And I'll accept.  What's important to note is that I did consider 8.Nxd5 but this would cost me a pawn after 8...Nxd5 9.exd5 Qxd5  Well what's important is not to give things away even a pawn unless you have a good reason for doing so.  A perfect example was my most recent loss against Jack Stockel by making a mistake that lost a pawn in the long run.
313,10,8,h3,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/3np3/B5b1/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',But now I go after his LSB.  I thought that I'd get tempo here but it doesn't work that way.

315,10,10,h5,b'r2qkb1r/2p2pp1/p1p5/4p2p/6b1/2PP1N1P/P1P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq h6',Trying to get an open h file.  I figured it out because I considered capturing his LSB at once.  But then as usual I asked myself why Reuben gave it away and if he blundered or not.  I did a ton of Homework involving both visualization and analyze the board.  By studying this I figured out that this was not a blunder after all.  The idea being is that I'd lost a pawn or get mated.  The idea being is that 12.hxg3 12...hxg3 now he has a threat against me one way or another.  If I move my Nf3 he can immediately play 13...Qh5 which would guarantee a mate in one with 14...Qh2# or 14...Qh1#  And if I give up my N and respond with 14.Qxf3 or 14.gxf3 he'll answer with 14...Qh3 resulting in the same thing since my Nf3 is no longer around.  I remember from previous mistakes but espeically from a loss against my OTB coach as well as the most recent mistake against Dave.  With Jack he gave away a pawn with how much more offenders he had.  So when I got greedy he was able to trap and win my Q.  Same story with Dave but it gets worse.  I took a pawn and with a discovered check he was able to get my Q.  Later on he my K was exposed and I couldn't castle due to a discovered check by castling Q side.  Later on I realized what my position was like and that he likely had a mating sequence forcing me to resign in less then 15 moves.  Knowing that since Jack accurately said that I didn't take enough time to study this time I was really going to do my Homework.

The idea being is that attacking the center is a way of controlling.  The way to do this is by centralizing a Rook as I learned in a recent annotation.
321,10,16,1Bd6,b'1r1qk2r/2p2pp1/p1pb4/4p2p/6b1/2PP1N1P/P1P2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w k -',And he protects.

For those that are wondering I won't use analyze the board as much.  In fact it temporarily stop soon but this will be substituted for visualization which is how I also find the right moves.  And as you might have guessed visualizing this outside (AFK) is an equivalent to playing blindfolded chess.  For those that are wondering I learned how to do this from GM Susan Polgar in her video ""My Genius Brain.""  It shows how she does this which is by picturing chess positions in her brain.  In fact she defeated an opponent who challenged her from visualization.  The only difference is that she can picture hundreds of positions whereas the max I can do is 5 or 6.  But this is the main way that I have surpassed a 1300 rating."

To think long term and protect the Q though I anticipated 16...g5 in which case I'd respond with 17.Bxe5 after which I'd win a R with a discovered check.  17...Qd7 18.Bxh8+  This move protects that.  But given that his f file is blocked (as now he can't play ...Qh4 (even if my Nf3 weren't around) I can win a piece at once.  BTW right after my next move I stop the analyze the board at once and switch to visualization as noted earlier.

But this is a super blunder because not only will I take his DSB but in the process I will at the very least win his Q for a R.  It's important to note that in addition to visulization I also used memory techniques.  It happened years ago but after making a mistake in a training game with ubermensch43 I made a grave mistake.  In doing so he was able to get the same pin which likewise won the Q for a R.  After which I resigned and I did annotate that game as it happened before reaching my lowest rating.  Although that training wasn't a good experience the idea was and is applying what I've learned and using my towards my game as I did here.  With that being said the only move that would've prevented black from losing his Q was 18...Qd8 in which case I'd play 19.Nd4 (leaving him a minor piece down.)  Still bad but it's better then losing the Q.  But best was 18...Qf8! (preventing ruinous loss of material.  He would be down two pawns but not more.)  19.exd6 gxf3 20.dxc7 Rc8 21.Qxf3 or 21.gxf3

But with this move I have a free Q as he'll be placed in check when with my next move.  Not only that but I will grab his g2 winning another pawn.

And normally I would pull back but I looked at two scenarios.  I realized that most likely he wanted my B.  So I am willing to sac that for a pawn.  If he grabs it I have a mate.  It's important to note that I remembered what I learned from GM Damios Lemos about positional sacs.  This is where you sacrifice a piece for mate or something similar that forces a win.  Preventing mate will mean the loss of a pawn.
331,10,26,2Bxg5,b'1r3k1r/2p1R3/p1pP1p2/6B1/8/2P5/P1P2PK1/R2Q4 b - -',With that being said I take.  I also looked at other lines such as black taking on d6.  But if 22...cxd6?? 23.Qxd6 and I'd still mate.  If he played for example 23...fxg5 24.Qf3+ Kg8 (forced) 25.Qf7# or 25.Qg7# are both mate.  That same thing would happen if black were to retreat his Rb8 on his 23rd move.  And if 23...Kg8 24.Qb8# is also mate.  Therefore black's only option is 22...Kg8 which prevents mate.  But I would Queen and Reuben would in addition lose a R in the process.  23.d7 Rd8 24.Re8+ Kg7 25.Rxh8 Kxh8 26.Qh5+ Kg7 27.Qe8 Rxe8 28.dxe8=Q.

But the main moral is based on what shamash said.  ""It's not about how much you learn but applying what you've learned and using them towards your game.""  By remembering this moral I was able to plan the variations that led to that nasty pin which won black's Queen.  And I remembered about the positional sacs which I used to deliver this mate."

371,13,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I was surprised to see him respond with the Reti Defense.  The most common move is 1..e5 or 1...c5  However there is nothing wrong with what Mike played.  And I view it as in book as he is developing whilst threatening e4.
372,13,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So I develop and protect.
373,13,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Now we have a similar position to what we see in the French Defense.  The only reason it hasn't transposed into that is because you don't see Nc3.  But the other moves are part of it.
374,13,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',However I am using the same methods that I'd use in the Caro Kann and French.  As the idea is that in the opening when black only advances one square white should answer with d4.
375,13,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Pinning my Nc3 and going after my e4 in the process.  The threat is 4...Bxc3 5.bxc3 Nxe4 and without my N he'd get a pawn.
376,13,6,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1b1PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Believe it or not I came close to making that mistake.  That's because I was inclined to break the pin with 4.Bd2  But after my blunder against knightrider62 (when mentoring her) I wasn't going to make the same mistake here.  The idea being is that you shouldn't give your student an early advance as kenneth_fiore_3 pointed out when annotating my training sessions with Mary and Gus.
377,13,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1b1PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Not surprised to see this as Mike is not only continuing to develop but he is threatening my d4 pawn in the process.
378,13,8,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1b1PP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',So I continue my development whilst protecting that pawn.
379,13,9,e5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b1PP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Still going after that pawn.  I initially thought that I could get a free pawn with 6.dxe5 and was therefore going to tell Mike that he made a mistake.  But that was when visualizing the position at work.  However when going back to the computer and analyzing I realized that he would get the pawn back immediately.  As a result I did not say anything as he hasn't made a mistake so far.
380,13,10,d5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/1b2P3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Knowing that e5 was safe I did not feel like exchanging as this could benefit him.  The idea is the same of not giving your student an early advantage.  So I hit his Nc6.  The idea now is to force black to waist tempo.  And since everything's safe that's when I'll use that time to break the pin since his Bb4 can get quite nasty.  Although it's not an immediate concern I wasn't going to chance for the same reason that I noted with how a different student won a piece for a pawn.
381,13,11,c6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/1b1nP3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Like before he is going after my pawn.  But this time I allow it since I don't lose anything.  In fact I'll take because I anticipate that he'll take back.  And if Mike does that's I'll respond with 9.Nf3 or 9.Nge2 so that I can castle on the next move.
382,13,12,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2P2n2/4p3/1b1nP3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',"? This however is Mike's first mistake.  In it I said You are playing very well so far. And normally it is a good idea to castle because of K safety. The only problem is that this loses a pawn. Instead was to retake on c6 as it would become an even exchange. Afterwhich castling would be ideal.  Then due to a grammatical error I changed it.  Therefore edited and said that better was to take on c6.  Later on he said ""I didn't see your messages. Thanks for the tip. What's the number of the move you're referring to?""  So I responded by telling that I was alluding to 8...0-0  What is meant is when he decided to castle as opposed to take back. "
383,13,13,cxd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1P1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1nP3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQ -',In order to keep my advantage I take another pawn.  Now I had a very difficult time deciding between here or on b7.  So variations were being calculated and I did some visualization at work but mainly at spin class.  Then I came back and did more.  After further studying I thought that I would (in the long run) get further by playing this.
384,13,14,Bxd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1nP3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQ -',He takes back.  However what made me reach the decision is where the bishop is now placed.  Had I played 9.cxb7 after 9...Bxb7 I felt that his LSB would be better placed since it's generally good on it's longest diagonal.  Therefore I was determined to take that option away from Mike.
385,13,15,1Nge2,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1nP3/2NB4/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Completing my development and preparing to castle.  Although I don't like my N being crammed and thus considered 10.Nf3 (especially with Jack saying that the players who aren't as strong often prefer when they're opponent's play this the difference is that it gives my Nc3 added protection.  I analyzed 10.Nf3 Nxf3 11.Qxf3 or 11.gxf3 but now if 11...Bxc3 I must take back with my DSB.  By playing this however I would be able to recapture with my N and I feel that my Knight is worth more then a Bishop in this position.
386,13,16,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1nP1b1/2NB4/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',! By pinning my Ne2 if he takes on c3 I'm forced to recapture with my Bd2.  Luckily that does not happen.   
387,13,17,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1nP1b1/2NB4/PPPBNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But before we exchange I castle at once.
388,13,18,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Adding pressure to my Nc3.
389,13,19,1a3,b'2rq1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1b2P3/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 b - -',But I get out of it by putting pressure onto his B.
390,13,20,1Nxe4,b'2rq1rk1/pp3ppp/8/4p3/1b2n3/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? Joe: ?? While it looks good this move is a blunder because although you got the pawn back it'll cost you a piece with my next move. Best was 14...Bxc3 and if 15.Bxc3 it's an even exchange as taking back with the R would be a blunder due my b2 pawn.  Mike:  I considered that. I Couldn't decide whether to take your knight with the bishop.  Joe: Except that I can grab it first. This is good for improvement because I've noticed this in some of your games. It's easy to grab material when you can. But it is also important however to look at the big picture and see how the opponent can respond. So the use of analyze is the board and if it shows that capturing a pawn will lose something worth more it's better not to take right away.  Mike: Thank you  Joe: You're welcome. In fact that's what we're here for.  By what we're here for what I'm alluding is that we're here to learn.  Therefore this lesson is going to help Mike to learn from his mistakes.  
391,13,21,1Qxe4,b'2rq1rk1/pp3ppp/8/4p3/1b2Q3/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I had a hard time deciding between 15.Nxe4 15.axb4 or this move.  But as with the other moves he is still going to take back with 15...Qxd2  The only difference was that afterwards with anyelse I'd be forced to take back with my Q.  After that he'd be able to equalize with 16...Bxd2  So by playing this not only have I won material but Mike will not be able to recompensate.  And I will further liquidate.
392,13,22,b6,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/1p6/4p3/1Q6/P1N5/1PPq1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Protecting b6.
393,13,23,1Rfd1,b'2r2rk1/p4ppp/1p6/4p3/1Q6/P1N5/1PPq1PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',So I go after his Q.

Best was 17...Qxc2 and this would be it's best follow up afterwards. 18.Nd5 Rfe8 19.Ne7+ Kh8 After this you don't lose anything else right away.  So the lesson there is to be aware of all threats including captures. If a move will result in something worse it's better not to play it.  Mike: Took the room. Looked like a free peice Rook  I feel stuck with Alan Fitzgerald. My bishop is stuck with nowhere to go  Joe: The thing to keep in mind is what's en-prise or hanging. That's why it's important to use analyze the board as opposed to making assumptions. Don't assume anything or as my coach would say ""Start thinking."" Always keep in mind on how the opponent respond.  Mike: I'm confused by that;seems like I'm cheating  Joe: You're not. What I mean is what's being attacked. For example your Q on d2 was attacked by my R. So it's important to figure out what's being threatened or what your opponent is threatening to do. The idea being that overlooking the these threats can get you in trouble."

What came to mind was that if 20.Nb5 (which I was planning to play) 20...Rd1+ 21.Rxd1 Rxd1+ 22.Qe1 Rxe1#  Therefore I played this because Jack has said that when your opponent threatens a back rank mate that is generally when you want to open up.  The idea is to ""Give your King air to breathe"" as he puts it.  However after trying to create a chess puzzle I realize that it doesn't have to end in mate.  But he would get some recompensation and as I'd be force to give up my Q to prevent mate.  So after 20...Rd1+ 21.Qe1 but then he has 21...Rxe1+ and after 22.Rxe1 he has recompensated for lost material.  So I think I still made the right choice to prevent this."

I thought that this move prevented that as now I'm thinking along the lines of 21...Rdxc2 22.Nxa7 Rxc1+ (which I forgot was check due to something I abhor which involves reversing the colors and a terrible oversight) so 23.Nxc8  But with me being in check I'd be forced to play 23.Kg2  So the move wasn't just a mistake but my thought process was completely wrong because it could've allowed him to win back a Rook.  And as TA points out one can draw with a Queen and Two Rooks.  The difference is that I'd be a piece up but even so I think he'd able to draw with best play.   
400,13,30,2Rdd8,b'2rr2k1/p4ppp/1p6/1N2p3/1Q6/P5P1/1PP2P1P/2R3K1 w - -',? However Mike played this instead.  So I said I understand that protecting the Rook was important. But you also could've protected the a7 square. With that being said 21...Rd7! was best as now not only don't you lose the R but a7 is safe. This move however loses another pawn.  Mike:  I was confused.  Trying to keep the king safe  Joe: Sorry. What I'm saying is that it's good to protect material. But when protecting you also want to ask yourself what else could be protected. For example you could've protected the R as well as the a7 pawn.  Edit @pagmatic68: I made a mistake here.  There is actually something better then 21...Rd7  With that being said best was 21...Rdxc2! which would've won back a pawn due to the variations I provided a move ago.

Best was 22...Rb8 as it does more then just protect your pawn.  In addition my threat against your Rook would be gone because I can't fork with 23.Nc6 as my Q is still attacked.  Therefore my next move would be something like 23.Qb3  So I'd have to run back and then (after retreating) you'd be able to answer with 23...Rd7 which would force me to retreat again.  Therefore although ahead you'd get some compensation by gaining two tempii and tempo is also very important.

Now I was threatening an eventual back rank mate.  But it wasn't immediate as there was somethingelse which was.  Joe: ?? Although this keeps the K safe the problem is that this move loses a R. Best was 23...Rf8 as now the R is protected. And after that 24...g5 would be an option.  Mike: I'm at the point that I'm not sure what to do? Not going to resign  Joe: Although they do consider it a resignable position I think you're making the right choice. Yes by staying in there is more to learn. As Judit Polgar would say ""Fight til the End.""  The reality is that I do think that black should resign soon but not quite yet.  The idea being is that I told a different student the same thing about not resigning after losing material.  Although Erika didn't lose her Q everything else was the same and point wise she was further behind.  Yet after opponent made mistakes she pulled a swindle and won a hopelessly lost position.  So I am trying to get this student in that habbit.  And I was also worried that telling Mike to resign would make him feel rushed.  The one thing I don't want to do is make my students feel rushed because taking your time to concentrate is very important.    "

So I said However I still think that giving advice is a good idea as that's what here for. With that being said almost any other move was better then this. The reason being was that your e pawn protected the Rook. By playing this I take it.  After this however I don't say anything else until after the game.  That's because with this blunder Mike does not have any more good moves left.

But his h7 or g4 pawn could've been protected with 26...h5  However I would answer with 27.Qe8+ and after 27...Kg7 28.Ne7 followed by 29.Qg7+ and I believe that mate would be unavoidable.  Even if I couldn't mate immediately I think that white still has an inevitable mating sequence.

If his monarch remains on e1 or goes to f1 I will mate with 29.Qh8#  If however he advances his f7 pawn I'll still mate with 29.Qe7#  So either way I have a mate in one.  I meant to tell him right away but got busy with my work schedule.  However I pm's him yesterday.  And I said I've been meaning to go over it with you but as I was busy yesterday and today there wasn't much time to do it. But the main lessons to learn are to look at and analyze each move before making them. That is not playing something because it appears good.  With that being said also look out for threats made by your opponent.  Remembering that will help you to improve your games.

As any good scientist will tell you the smaller the sample size the less reliable the results. And though I do love a pawn chain the mealy movement of the f pawn in this position appeals to the tipsy not especially since I find the Sicilian susceptible to a heavy weight of material on the queenside. I also find that the impressive side-by-side combination of the knights and bishops should suit my desire for aggressive space-grabbing in the opening and early middle (regardless of what opening I play). GERONIMO!

Believe it or not this is also what I would've played because the idea is to liquidate when ahead.  The only problem is that this will cause black to have doubled.  When it comes to doubled pawns and a position is reached where I'm not sure if it's harmful or not.  As a general rule I assume it's allright until major pieces have been exchanged.  Therefore I'll allow it because Joe said that in general doubled pawns are of no asset until the major pieces have been exchanged.  However he also pointed out the same thing that reversion said and I agree on both.  It depends on the position and in the case despite being ahead TA implied that the doubled pawns is going to cause Boris some problems.  That's why he'll take on c6 as opposed to e6.

571,21,7,Qf6,b'r4bnr/p1p2kpp/2p1bq2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? And Boris defends but according to Joe this is where black starts to go wrong.  In fact he's already in trouble with this move.  Here's the thing white was able to deviate from the General Openings.  But since white is stronger black should not deviate.  To make matters worse it's in front of the exposed King.  Now I knew a lot about the basic guidelines but I recently learned that one of them is also not bringing your Queen in front of an exposed.  After that he'll use that extra tempo to continue developing.  Instead as I mentioned in the intro he should follow the General Opening Guidelines.  With that being said I would've played 7...Bd6 as that also protects that pawn whilst developing a piece.
572,21,8,d4,b'r4bnr/p1p2kpp/2p1bq2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ d3',Preparing to develop his DSB by advancing the center pawn.  And once he does Joe will harrass Boris's Queen.  It starts here because black must give up his pawn to avoid something worse.
573,21,9,exd4,b'r4bnr/p1p2kpp/2p1bq2/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? But by taking Boris is lost according to what Joe implied starting with his next move.  Even so what's mentioned is that white has an edge because it's harrassed.  So bringing the Q to safety means that TA has a lead in development.  Best in my opinion was 8...Qg4 and I'm not sure how white would respond but I'd go with 9.e5 to protect my center pawn. 
574,21,10,Bg5,b'r4bnr/p1p2kpp/2p1bq2/6B1/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',That's because Joe will win that Q back no matter where black goes as it traps.  Although black finds the best move and gets a N leaving him a little ahead it won't be enough against his opposition.  That's because white is a much more experienced opponent.  It falls right into the same category as when reversion's attempted a trap which I annotated that against more experienced doesn't work.  And what TA said is that once this happens the game is lost for Boris.  With how much of his Q sacs I study for Homework (due to what I've learned) and the fact that I've used his methods to teach students I as usual strongly agree with him.
575,21,11,1Nd2,b'r3kbnr/p1p3p1/2p1b1p1/6B1/3pP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',One of the other reasons that Joe has a win is because in addition to what I mentioned black has doubled.  As we'll see he also said that in the openings like the Ruy Lopez which reversion also noted doubled pawns are of no real asset.  But in the mid and endgames (as we're in the midgame) doubled pawns become problematic.  In addition white is finding a better outpost for his N.  And when he does Boris will have to deal with another threat.
576,21,12,1Be7,b'r3k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p1b1p1/6B1/3pP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Developing a piece and threatening to win white's Bg5.  But as noted in TA's book the damage has been done and I agree with him especially due to how much I've learned.  In addition to GM Susan Polgar Jack Stockel and archduke_piccolo Joe is also one of the main reasons that I've improved which is why enjoy being in his club and studying games like this.
577,21,13,1Nf3,b'r3k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p1b1p1/6B1/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',What I was implying with 12.Nd2 is that the threat is winning a pawn but Joe is also protecting Bg5.
578,21,14,1Bg4,b'r3k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p3p1/6B1/3pP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',So Boris decides to hit Joe's Nf3.  But in this case doubled pawns are of no concern because they're closer to the center as TA also notes.
579,21,15,1Bf4,b'r3k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p3p1/8/3pPBb1/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',So Joe hit's c7.
580,21,16,1Bxf3,b'r3k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p3p1/8/3pPB2/5b2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',But Boris takes nonetheless.  According to TA however enabling white to double up closer to the center will add to Joe's winning advantage.
581,21,17,Rc8,b'2r1k1nr/p1p1b1p1/2p3p1/8/3pPB2/5P2/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',Protecting his b7 pawn.

In this position I also would've castled long because castling short would appear to leave the King exposed.  In fact it would be similar to the blunder I made against Jack last week.  So I think that TA made the right choice.
583,21,19,1c5,b'2r1k1nr/p1p1b1p1/6p1/2p5/3pPB2/5P2/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',Trying to figure out what he can do about those doubled pawns.

587,21,23,1Nf6,b'2r1k2r/p1p1b1p1/5n2/2p3p1/3pP3/2P2PB1/PP3P1P/2KR3R w - -',Completing his development but this time it's too little too late because of what TA mentioned earlier.  In fact not only will Joe exchange but he will pick up a pawn in the process.
588,21,24,Nh5,b'2r1k2r/p1p1b1p1/8/6pn/3RP3/5PB1/PP3P1P/2K4R w - -',In a game like this where you should not deviate I'm all but certain that Boris has made his position worse due to the N being on the rim.
589,21,25,2Ra4,b'2r1k2r/p1p1b1p1/8/6pn/R3P3/5PB1/PP3P1P/2K4R b - -',So Joe takes advantage of black's last move which I deem to be a mistake by hitting a7.
590,21,26,2Nxg3,b'2r1k2r/p1p1b1p1/8/6p1/R3P3/5Pn1/PP3P1P/2K4R w - -',The idea is to liquidate when ahead.  But I believe that Boris made the wrong choice because white will now undouble his pawns.  It wasn't much of an asset to begin with which is why Joe allowed it.  But by getting rid of doubled pawns white gets a very solid pawn chain which is very beneficial here.
591,21,27,Bc5,b'2r1k2r/p1p3p1/8/2b3p1/R3P3/5PP1/PP5P/2K4R w - -',Protecting a7.
592,21,28,2Ra5,b'2r1k2r/p1p3p1/8/R1b3p1/4P3/5PP1/PP5P/2K4R b - -',So Joe hit's his Bishop instead.
593,21,29,2Bb6,b'2r1k2r/p1p3p1/1b6/R5p1/4P3/5PP1/PP5P/2K4R w - -',Which Boris also protects.
594,21,30,2Re5+,b'2r1k2r/p1p3p1/1b6/4R1p1/4P3/5PP1/PP5P/2K4R b - -',Instead of taking on g5 (which I likely would've played) Joe goes for the gusto by placing Boris in check.  But this move makes sense as black's K will be more exposed.
595,21,31,2Kc2,b'2r4r/p1p2kp1/1b6/4R1p1/4P3/5PP1/PPK4P/7R b - -',I still anticipated 25.Rxg5 but this move makes sense to me.  The idea being is that we're now in the endgame which in that phase the monarch is a powerful weapon.  So in this position Joe is mobilizing his King.
596,21,32,2Rhd8,b'2rr4/p1p2kp1/1b6/4R1p1/4P3/5PP1/PPK4P/7R w - -',The plan involves a nasty threat since Boris will play 26...Be3

598,21,34,2Rf5+,b'2rr4/p1p2kp1/8/5R2/4P3/4bPP1/PPK4P/7R b - -',And he delays that nasty check by placing Boris in check first.
599,21,35,2Re1,b'2rr2k1/p1p3p1/8/5R2/4P3/4bPP1/PPK4P/4R3 b - -',Preventing the nasty threat because with Joe's Rook on e1 if Boris plays 28...Rd2+?? after 29.Kc3 white will a win a piece.  Although it's not a fork this is a double attack since two pieces are under fire.  The bishop is by white's Rook and the monarch is attacking the Rook.
600,21,36,2Bb6,b'2rr2k1/p1p3p1/1b6/5R2/4P3/5PP1/PPK4P/4R3 w - -',Therefore Boris wisely decides to retreat.

With that being said white's next move would be 43.Rg8+  Now Boris can't take due to white's Re2 (which is why a Rook behind a passed pawn is lethal.)  So after he gets out of it white immediately Queens with 44.e8=Q+  From there tactical-abyss has a mate in 7.  Seeing this Boris resigned.  The moral of this game is what was presented in ""The Deeper Chess Theory Club"" since it was part of the lecture.  In it Joe said ""Borishurgina nearly 1900 rated player has an abundance of positional errors in theory right out of the opening few movesincluding simply bring out his Queen to start(mistake)then placing his Q in front of his exposed King on move #7then allowing my amazing Knight fork on move # 10....which almost equalized the game within 2 pawn values by move #11.Technicallythe game was over already by move # 10 in my book!Feel free to add your own comments if you like in the meantime.Notice his pawn moves in the opening 4....d5.This is not controlling the centerits only giving me more material.A common mistake that players make in my Q sac games.I spot the pattern immediately and know the game will usually end up in my favorjust from that pawn thrust move alone on blacks side.Boris was in a mating net and in serious trouble(as he knew)so he resigned early before mate and scurried away quickly.I have a game in my Q sac thread somewhere else where I beat Boris before.Perhaps it is similarI have not checked yet. 

So what is the lesson here?There seems to be a serious lack of tactics with Borisbut even more soa weak positional strategy with things like Q thrust moves early on and doubled pawns by mid game on the g file that were open to attack and needed to be supported...and were not.Theory dictates that doubled pawns in the opening like in some Ruy games and some Trompowski Attack games either diminish the pawn value combination only fractionally or not at all.But in mid and endgamedoubled pawns are more open to attackespecially if centralized or on b or g files.This is magnified if the opposing side has a pawn majority(as I did) on my Kings side that can be utilized as an exchangefile opener to blacks Kingex-ray or P=Q on the 8th rank promotion. 

Suremistakes happen in 5 minutes.But technicallythat should not matter in just the first few moves of this game.Boris's ""pattern""of erratic and weaker moves proves he needs to buckle down on just some of the simpler areas of opening theory.For even if the game was a 2 minute game with zero increment(like on some other chess sites)his early Q moves and pawn thrusts should not have occurredespecially for a nearly 1900 rated player."""

Zato i objavljujem ovu partiju najviše za nas male igrače ispod 1700: uvek treba imati na umu gde će završiti pešaci u završnici i svoji i tuđi jer to na kraju odluči sve...

It is played on the French lines but I don't remember being a common option during the Sicilian opening phase. 5...Bc5 or Be7 seemed (now to me) more adequate. also a6 is played very often here to avoid the next move that white wisely uses to his advantage.

White has achieved a clear superiority in just 7 moves! This shows how important is to know not only the openings theory but also the concepts of development including the center.
700,25,6,a3,b'r1bq1knr/1p1p1ppp/p1nNp3/8/1b2P3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',White now has just to start reinforcing d6 and then throw all the firepower onto the undeveloped BK flank.
701,25,7,Bxc3+,b'r1bq1knr/1p1p1ppp/p1nNp3/8/4P3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',This at least creates a weakened pawn flank. Not enough compensation though.
702,25,8,Qf6,b'r1b2knr/1p1p1ppp/p1nNpq2/8/4P3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Trying to trick my opponent into 10.Nxc8 Rxc8; 11.Qxd7 and 11...Qxc3+ but at this level small chances to get that bluff reaching a safe port. An alternative 9...e5 doesn't seem to alleviate things more.
703,25,9,Ng6,b'r1b2k1r/1p1p1ppp/p1nNpqn1/8/4P3/P1PQ4/2P1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Several N moves that lead to nothing. I cant even try things like h5. Notice that Bc8 is trapped for a long time pretty useless there. White has no need to change its situation there.
704,25,10,1Qg3,b'r1b2k1r/1p1p1ppp/p1nNpq2/4n3/4P3/P1P3Q1/2P1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',"White is now threatening so many things and you can foresee several winning plans here that I just threw the towel off. Things like 14.Bg5 or h4 to get the bishop onto a3 or else f4 with e5 were just too much for me so I tried to focus on the rest of the games of this round.
Hope some of you have learned a lesson: develop properly and do not leave your center exposed to an attack early in the game it will mostly cost you the game!
Nicely played by laslandes!"

The long term idea is to play ...e6 liquidating white's center pawns and creating possible tactic against white's king along the light squares with the queen on a8. Also with the queen on a8 taking on the white a-pawn is a threat.

I think it is a pretty useful move. The two more popular moves are Re1 and Qe2. But IMO both are not as useful as Qc2. 
713,26,8,1Qa8,b'q4rk1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N2NP1/1PQ2PKP/R1B4R w - -',Black continues to put pressure on a4 and build long term tactics on the a8-h1 diagonal.

Here's a game which I just finished playing which not only likely the fastest game of the section is also rife with tactics and teachable play and most of all fun to watch (as white). Recently I've picked up this Smith-Morra gambit as white with relatively good success. I got white both games today both Morras and the first was a 20 move theoretical draw so I was itching for a killing this game.

Also if you notice a large rating gap between white and black I taught as a coach for 4 years at a chess club and having been asked to play games against students while rusty I took many rating hits. I have played with fair success in U/2200 sections for over a year now so although I dislike playing up (since it is rude to the other player) no reason to stop now. It is quite hilarious to see a 1877 playing a 2165 at board 1 in the U/2200 section (a different round of mine).

For your convenience I recommend if you are not already observe this game in interactive mode. There are far too many annotations to make scrolling page by page an enjoyable experience."

White: ""So Black I'm going to give you a pawn but in exchange I get to have all of the fun the entire game. Deal or no Deal.""

2. cxd4 is the main way to play all other moves transpose or are simply bad for black. For example after 2...d6 white enjoys a comfortable position after 3. dxc5 Qa5+ 4. Nc3 ahead the tempos without the cost of the pawn. 2...e6 seems logical however white enters a solid Benoni after 3. d5 which would take many Sicilian players out of their repertoire. Anyways in this game black fully accepts the gambit so let's just trod on ahead.

Note: Black was noticeably unnerved and unhappy with white's opening selection (alongside the pressure from playing down 250 rating points and not knowing my actual strength level). Mission accomplished!"
796,29,2,Nxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So now that the smoke has cleared white is down a pawn but is up a knight and a pawn (a powerful central pawn) in development. Meanwhile with the (half) open c and d files white will later activate his rooks splendidly. Now black must consider his course of action...
797,29,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The most flexible response. 4...e6 or 4...d6 are both acceptable but commit to a structure earlier and may lead to different developmental approaches for white. 4...Nc6 is completely sound and leaves nearly every line of Morra defense on the table.
798,29,4,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',A crucial move for black. Often times when black does not make this simple move black can get mowed down with Nb5 which enters quickly on the dark squares. It is logical to stop it as soon as possible.
799,29,5,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',It is wise and necessary to castle early as white in the Morra. Keeping the king exposed can and will cost you your attack on many occasions. Plus who doesn't want to use the h1 rook as soon as possible? Actually as you'll see later in this game: not me. But king safety is nice.
800,29,6,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',"And now we see the variation Black has committed to. Although most Morra variations are without a name due to the rarity of the opening this response is the Grandmaster approved choice employed by many top GMs including Hikaru Nakamura and Loek van Wely. Black's goal is simple: it is too early to commit the dark squared bishop to a square the light squared bishop may enjoy a post on b7 or potentially d7 or other squares on the diagonal should it open. Black wants to commit the knight to g6 where it stops white from thrusting e4-e5 with a bind on the dark squares and white's light squared bishop from coming to f4. Often times one or both knights end up crossing the e5 square as a transition square or outpost.

Admittedly black confessed after the game that they had been testing this opening through blitz and had little formal repertoire with this line but that in no way diminishes the potency of the opening itself. Also admittedly this is often times white's least comfortable variation of the Morra accepted perhaps only second to the classical main line.

Black is also fine in other lines should they choose to first develop the dark squared bishop however then white can opt for e5 or Bf4 should he choose among other heinous deeds."
801,29,7,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/6B1/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',"Necessary. This move provokes a pawn move as black cannot develop properly otherwise which in turn creates potential future weaknesses around black's king. Plus it's annoying. 

Protip: Play as many annoying moves as you can as long as they are sound. Just don't lose points that way. Then you're the one who's annoyed."
802,29,8,f6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1pn1pp/p1n1pp2/6B1/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',"The more common response. 8...h6 is completely acceptable as well but is less preferred since often times white's bishop ends up on g3: the diagonal black had hoped to keep it off with Nge7-g6. Plus f6 supports a future knight on e5 and stops a white knight or pawn from romping on in.

White: ""Tickle tickle.""

Black: ""Stahp."""
803,29,9,Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1pn1pp/p1n1pp2/8/2B1P3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Having fulfilled its duty of provoking f6 the bishop returns to the pleasant e3 square targeting the weakened pawn structure on black's queenside.
804,29,10,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p1n1ppn1/8/2B1P3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Preferable is 9...b5 however this move transposes as long as b5 is played next. But only as long as.
805,29,11,1Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p1n1ppn1/8/4P3/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Critical maneuver of this variation: white drops back the bishop as not to be harassed by the b7-b5 thrust. White aims to potentially sacrifice a piece on d5: a make-or-break theme of the Morra however 3 things interfere with this plan: 1. Black having a pawn on d6 2. Black harassing an unprotected bishop on c4 and 3. Black's king being closer than 2 moves from castling. In this position Bb3 fulfills the final restriction preparing to open pandora's box with Nd5!
806,29,12,1Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1p1pb1pp/p1n1ppn1/8/4P3/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?! Dubious. Black ignores the idea of Nd5 and instead moves the bishop to an innocuous square. This move does little to help black aside from preparing to castle which would prevent Nd5 except that after having played f6 the king will simply be stranded in the center or be forced to return the piece to castle anyways. 10...b5 is absolutely necessary gaining space on the queenside to seek counterplay against a knight sac in fact 10...b5 is the only move in book. However discouraged by the thought of black castling in only 1 move I did not sacrifice on d5 yet first playing the solid 2nd move (and only inaccuracy/mistake of the game on my part).
807,29,13,1Rc1,b'r1bqk2r/1p1pb1pp/p1n1ppn1/8/4P3/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',"!? Inaccurate but solid. This move does less to help in the attack than a sac would however it does place the a1 rook on the optimal square and prime the cannons for Nd5 upon castling kingside.

White lets Black get away with dropping the soap but only for a moment. You need to build the suspense you see."
808,29,14,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p1n1ppn1/8/4P3/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',?! Black likely unaware of the dangers of Nd5 ignores the threat and carries on. Remember kids Get Castled and Carry On is not always a good idea. 
809,29,15,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p1n1ppn1/3N4/4P3/1B2BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',"! White immediately threatens 13. Bb6 Qe8 14. Nc7 winning the rook and if 12...Rb8 then 13. Bb6 works quite well again after 13...Qe8 14. Bc7 Ra8 15. Nb6 Ra7 with a positional bind and a lasting attack. Black despite being left with one option (to take) spent 45 minutes on this move perhaps sensing that something had gone quite wrong and searching for a way out or perhaps simply out of angst trying to calculate their next few moves beforehand. Either way to me it's a free time advantage and with 28 moves to go before the SD kicks in time is a precious commodity especially in a thick position like this.

White: ""Mmhmm. Now I'll tell you what I like you and I want you. Now we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way: the choice is yours. What's it gonna be?"""
810,29,16,1exd5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p1n2pn1/3P4/8/1B2BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',"Completely forced. All other moves simply lose the knight for the sake of a meaningless check.

Basically all other captures besides exd5 drop YOUR soap."
811,29,17,1Na5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p4pn1/n2P4/8/1B2BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',"? The first mistake (or perhaps blunder) of the game. Instead of addressing the threat of the discovered check appropriately with 13...Kh8 Black seeks to trade off the knight for the light squared sniper. However as they will soon find out Kh8 was not only recommended but necessary and the knight on c6 may have been more valuable than they thought.


Black: ""You and I won't be doing anything any kind of way."""
812,29,18,1Qxb3+,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p2P1pn1/8/8/1Q2BN2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',A critical move order. 15. dxe7 while regaining the piece allows 15...Qxe7 16. Qxb3+ Qf7 which neutralizes white's initiative and entire attack instantly. Now the reason for Kh8 is revealed.
813,29,19,1Rf7,b'r1bq2k1/1p1pbrpp/p2P1pn1/8/8/1Q2BN2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',"Forced otherwise 15...Kh8 16. Bb6 would force black into the line 16...Qe8 17. Rfe1 with severe lasting pressure and no immediate need to regain the piece. This is the hidden reason behind the necessity for Kh8 earlier: if 13...Kh8 then 14. d6! Re8!? 15. Qd5!? and Black cannot retreat the bishop lest he be mated and will be forced to take on d6 with 15...Bxd6 only to be met with an outpost for white with 16. Qxd6 Qe7 17. Bc5! where black is miserable and worse although not lost (yet).

Back to 15...Rf7 this move obviously creates a pin however this pin is more valuable than it may seem immediately."
814,29,20,1Bb6,b'r1bq2k1/1p1pbrpp/pB1P1pn1/8/8/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',"White: ""Yeah okay I see you're choosing the hard way."""

816,29,22,1Rc7,b'r1b2qk1/1pRpnrpp/pB3p2/8/8/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/5RK1 b - -',"! Computer-esque. Had I not been a Morra fanatic and lover of positional binds I'd have never found such a silly looking move. The rook although doing little at the moment creates potential lateral pressure along the 7th rank thus ruling out a d-pawn move for a while. The rook threatens future tactics such as potentially trapping the bishop on its starting square or capturing a knight on c6 for a deflection. Now black must answer the question: what is your plan to get through or out of this mess? The sad answer is nothing.

White: ""Having fun black?""

Black: ""No.""

White: ""Good."""
817,29,23,1Kh8,b'r1b2q1k/1pRpnrpp/pB3p2/8/8/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Unpinning.
818,29,24,1Bc5,b'r1b2q1k/1pRpnrpp/p4p2/2B5/8/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/5RK1 b - -',More pinning. And probing.

820,29,26,2Nd2,b'r1b3qk/1pRpnrpp/p4p2/2B5/8/1Q6/PP1N1PPP/5RK1 b - -',!! Possibly the most beautiful move of the game. Completely ignoring the rules of development the knight maneuvers to enter the game via c4-b6 or e4-d6. Meanwhile it eliminates any back-rank counter-play for black in the future by allowing Nf1. And lastly it is still unclear whether the rook will simply go to e1 or to a different square as the case may or may not turn out. And all the while black has no means to free himself from his torment.
821,29,27,2Nc6,b'r1b3qk/1pRp1rpp/p1n2p2/2B5/8/1Q6/PP1N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',A fine move but as it turns out black's knight may very well be the only active piece in his whole position. The rook and bishop on the queenside are completely hemmed in the rook on f7 is stuck thanks to the bishop on c5 the back rank is still weak and the queen on g8 still has no means of escape. Black's only chance of survival is likely sacrificing the d-pawn. If you recall on move 13 I mentioned that the knight on c6 which was traded for the b3 bishop may have been positionally inappropriate. That knight would have been highly valuable here but to black's credit the bishop on b3 would be a monster here too.
822,29,28,2Bd6,b'r1b3qk/1pRp1rpp/p1nB1p2/8/8/1Q6/PP1N1PPP/5RK1 b - -',"What was black's only chance of survival again? Now the bind lasts eternally unless black intentionally loses faster to try his chances at some counter-play.

From c1 the rook immediately threatens 23. R1xc6! where the pawn cannot recapture due to 23...dxc6? 24. Qxf7 and the queens will be traded and the black king will be lonely and miserable. 21...b5 also prepares the option of Ra8-a7 which now fails to the comical 22...Ra7? 23. Rxa7 Nxa7 24. Rc7! and the pain returns threatening both Rxa7 and Rxc8 which are unstoppable in unison. 22...Nd4 is a fabulous way to lose quickly after 23. Rxc8! picks up either a piece or a rook for the queen exchange. 22...Rb8 fails to 23. R7xc6 winning the knight and threatening the rook on b8. Meanwhile Black's bishop on c8 rook on a8 rook on f7 and queen on g8 are all still spectators. Black is forcibly losing a piece here but as humans do black chooses the line with the most spectacular unforeseen finish...

A nice little gem amongst the 20-move theoretical draws of the Expert section. This game was submitted for the best game prize (update on that later). Hope you enjoyed the game and if you have any questions feel free to ask away I know I didn't cover all the lines just most of the important ones.

24...Qxf7 25. Rxc8+ Qg8 (25...Rxc8?! 26. Rxc8+ leads into the same endgame minus the rook for both sides) 26. Rxg8+ Kxg8 27. Rc7 with an easily won endgame for white and easily lost for black.

And lastly in case you didn't get the nonsensical prison humor it is referencing perhaps one of the funniest series of all times: The Boondocks. If you are mature enough to handle adult humor I highly recommend it but no-can-do for the kiddies (I still love the kiddies).

869,31,27,2b3,b'2krr3/ppp2ppp/n5b1/8/2P3P1/NPK4P/P6R/R5N1 b - -',Still neglecting developement but if Ne2? Re3#! or if Nf3 Rd3+ and the N is just lost for nothing. This move opens a fly square for the white K. 
870,31,28,2Rd3+,b'2k1r3/ppp2ppp/n5b1/8/2P3P1/NPKr3P/P6R/R5N1 w - -',All the same without being able to spot something more. 
871,31,29,2Kb2,b'2k1r3/ppp2ppp/n5b1/8/2P3P1/NP1r3P/PK5R/R5N1 b - -',How to go on now? It's much harder to play attacking than defending. Again I am only +1 in material so I have to find a way to make my advantage concrete. 
872,31,30,2Rde3,b'2k1r3/ppp2ppp/n5b1/8/2P3P1/NP2r2P/PK5R/R5N1 w - -',Almost no useful moves for white again. 
873,31,31,2Nb5,b'2k1r3/ppp2ppp/n5b1/1N6/2P3P1/1P2r2P/PK5R/R5N1 b - -',Well you'll expect Kb8 defending a7 but... I can easily give away a pawn for a tempo. 
874,31,32,2Nb4,b'2k1r3/ppp2ppp/6b1/1N6/1nP3P1/1P2r2P/PK5R/R5N1 w - -',This threatens Nd3+. Not a big deal but still going on and keeping my pieces over the WK. 
875,31,33,Kb8,b'1k2r3/Npp2ppp/6b1/8/1nP3P1/1P2r2P/PK5R/R5N1 w - -',See? Nothing happened. Of course I didn't play c6? the previous move (Nd6+ losing he exchange). 
876,31,34,2Nb5,b'1k2r3/1pp2ppp/6b1/1N6/1nP3P1/1P2r2P/PK5R/R5N1 b - -',...and this N is harmless and I have the tempo. 
877,31,35,2Ka3,b'1k2r3/1pp2ppp/6b1/1N6/2P3P1/KP1nr2P/P6R/R5N1 b - -',Not clear about Kc3 instead but who wants another discovered threat?

879,31,37,2Nc3,b'1k6/1pp2ppp/4r1b1/8/2P3P1/KPNnr2P/P6R/R5N1 b - -',Only move to prevent mate. You can see Nc3's potential. 
880,31,38,2Na4,b'1k6/1pp2ppp/r5b1/8/N1P3P1/KP1nr2P/P6R/R5N1 b - -',Ok but this N is lost after...
881,31,39,2c6,b'1k6/1p3ppp/r1p3b1/8/N1P3P1/KP1nr2P/P6R/R5N1 w - -',...threatening b5. White can hardly cope with it. My advantage will be concrete (a full piece as the least). Of course b4 - opening a square for the K is useless as it sets up a discovered check with the N... which I wouldn't have gone for of course!
882,31,40,2Re2,b'1k6/1p3ppp/r1p3b1/8/N1P3P1/KP1nr2P/P3R3/R5N1 b - -',Nice (given the losing situation) since it get rid of one of my attacking pieces. I had to choose among Rmoves along the 3rd rank (Re8+ is no dangerous) but I preferred the tempo (almost always preferring tempo!)
883,31,41,b5,b'1k6/5ppp/r1p3b1/1p6/N1P3P1/KP1n3P/P3N3/R7 w - b6',A piece as the least is mine. Can you see the best white's move here?
884,31,42,cxb5,b'1k6/5ppp/r5b1/1p6/N5P1/KP1n3P/P3N3/R7 w - -',Again: can you see the best white move here?
885,31,43,3Nec3,b'1k6/5ppp/r5b1/1p6/N5P1/KPNn3P/P7/R7 b - -',"?? No he just wants to retake his N with the c3's one but overlooked my answer. I almost went for the N I confess. But you have to look and search for ""something more"" ever... even to find out that there is nothing. Fortunately I did see it..."
886,31,44,3b4#,b'1k6/5ppp/r5b1/8/Np4P1/KPNn3P/P7/R7 w - -',Even material and a very nice mate with just N and pawn. No need for R or B. Thank you Caissa you were with me this time. 
887,32,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So it starts as a Sicilian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence
888,32,1,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And we reach the usual position in the Open Sicilian.
889,32,2,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',He plays the Richter–Rauzer Attack probably the strongest continuation and at the moment the most popular.
890,32,3,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',We both follow the most usual continuation for a few moves.
891,32,4,Qd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',He prepares to castle.
892,32,5,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This is normal.

896,32,9,Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w k -',I continue with my queen-side operations.

Presumably the idea is throwing the queen over to the king-side to support a pawn advance there. I don't think it turns out particularly well for white.
900,32,13,1h6,b'2rqk2r/1p1bbpp1/p1nppn1p/6B1/3NP2P/2N2P2/PPP3P1/2KRQB1R w k -',So I hit his bishop.

He can't take back with the rook so he has to take with the pawn and then my weakness on d6 is shielded by his pawn on d5. They is also the chance of an attack on a2. I'm quite happy with this position for black.
907,32,20,1Kb1,b'2rqk2r/1p2bpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P2P/2N1BP2/PPP3P1/1K1RQB1R b k -',So he gives some more protection to a2

In return for the exchange black gets the a pawn and I shatter his queen side pawns. I have enough compensation but not more. I was also motivated because nothing else seemed very good for instance if instead 16......d5? then 17. Nxd5 and if Qxe1 18. Nxf6 check and white ends up a pawn up. In the same way if 16..... 0-0 then 17. Nd5! again is powerful.

916,32,29,1Be6,b'4k2r/1p2bpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P2P/2PBBP2/2P3P1/2KR3R w k -',I have to retreat my bishop before it is trapped in with c3-c4.
917,32,30,2Kd2,b'4k2r/1p2bpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P2P/2PBBP2/2PK2P1/3R3R b k -',This is a good centralised place for his king.
918,32,31,2O-O,b'5rk1/1p2bpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P2P/2PBBP2/2PK2P1/3R3R w - -',I finally castle. I did consider Kd7 but I thought I may need d7 to manoeuvre my knight and/or bishop.

930,32,43,2exf4,b'5nk1/1pr1bpp1/p2pb3/6Pp/4Pp1P/2PBB3/1RPK4/R7 w - -',I take.
931,32,44,Ng6,b'6k1/1pr1bpp1/p2pb1n1/6Pp/4PB1P/2PB4/1RPK4/R7 w - -',I hit his bishop and h4.
932,32,45,2Bg3,b'6k1/1pr1bpp1/p2pb1n1/6Pp/4P2P/2PB2B1/1RPK4/R7 b - -',So his bishop retreats.
933,32,46,2f6,b'6k1/1pr1b1p1/p2pbpn1/6Pp/4P2P/2PB2B1/1RPK4/R7 w - -',I keep up my attack on the king-side. I threaten to take twice on g5. If he takes I take back with my bishop attacking c3.
934,32,47,2Rb6,b'6k1/1pr1b1p1/pR1pbpn1/6Pp/4P2P/2PB2B1/2PK4/R7 b - -',But he counter-attacks d6.

937,32,50,3fxe5,b'6k1/1pr1b1p1/pR1pb3/4p1Pp/4P2P/2PB4/2PK4/R7 w - -',If I take with the other pawn my bishop on d6 goes.

I calculated that if I take it he also wins the d pawn and has an advantage in the ending while if I don't take it he still has problems penetrating on the queen-side - or anywhere else. I was dozy for allowing this move I should of considered it. I put it down to complacency and I knew at this stage I only had to draw and I had convinced myself that this position was drawn and I let my guard down. I am very lucky that the position is still drawn but at least I made the right choice in not taking the rook.

Qh5 at any time in the immediate future could prove to become a thorn in Black's endgame plans.

White may have been better with 16. c4 opening up an avenue of retreat for the lcb and eventually allowing it to get either in front or behind the Q on the h5-d1 diagonal. One more supporting piece for that a4 pawn has also been removed moving White closer to feeling pressured into axb5 and the generation of a dangerous passed pawn on the a file for Black. A very very minor positional win here then for Black perhaps but in the spirit of Euwe's little threats Black is building tiny threats and also shutting down White's potential to do the same.

White perhaps decides that it will babysit the b pawn instead and let the b pawn in turn stand sentry over the a3 square. Or perhaps White wants to tempt Black into exchanging the a pawn with 19....a3 20 bxa3 Rxa3 giving Black a rook on the 3rd rank yet tossing in it's valuable passed a pawn in the process. 
 
Instead Black can simply take c3 and generate a pair of connected passed pawns in the exchange. Though on this occasion that would give the White rook a bead on the b pawn. White might also be trying to load up Q and rook on the b file: placing tanks solidly in the way of the Black's planned infantry charge up the queenside flank. 

White then seems congnisant of Black's gameplan and is responding accordingly. Of course under Euwe's theory of the middlegame naturally one's opponent responds to the first second third little threat. But as they keep responding they are not generating any threats of their own and must eventually be overwhelmed. The next few moves will prove telling. "

As mentioned earlier White may have decided to move Rb1 in order to get a bead on the b pawn. Black is going to hand White that pawn and in the process turn up the pressure on the a1 square possibly even saccing it's Q depending on the line. If White falters (example line with the Q sac 20.	bxc3	a3

The purpose here is less about winning the game (in that case I would probably choose the strategy of keeping the b and a pawns connected and effect their movement up the qside with solid tactical play) and more about setting a puzzle. The initial purpose of this game: to demonstrate the virtues of castling to complete development rather than as part of development in the R-L has been achieved. Joe acknowledges the possibilities and will keep it as a tool in his belt to be used if and when he sees fit. 

Now in his games I've noticed that he can be occasionally king-hit in middle games by a tempting exchange or even seeming error by the opponent only to find himself suddenly losing a major piece or worse due to a lack of simple tactical calculation being too concerned with strategic concerns or what happened in a GM game from a similar position. What he fails to realise is that high level players won't bother with cheap tricks (like constructing a mating net with plenty big holes in it but with a nice juicy morsel as the bait) against high level players since they know their opponent won't fall for such nonsense. Against poor Joe though players of all abilities have no such scruples! ;)

So this was where the mentoring begins.  The idea being that I didn't say anything because of well knightrider was playing but she asked to mentor.  As a result when I saw a slight inaccuracy that's when I'd start.  Therefore I said that although this does protect her e5 pawn there was a better move.  As Homework I asked her to find it but I did it using the charleshiggie method as I've been mentored in his annotations.  So I showed her the position just before this move so right after 6.d4 asking how black should proceed.  Her first guess was 6...d6 preparing to develop her Bc8.  I told her in general that would be but in this position there was a slightly better move.  Then she guessed  d5 Nexd5 Nxe5 QXe5 and I told her that she was very close but it wasn't close because the move would lose a pawn.  After that knightrider62 said she couldn't find it so I said that best was 6...exd4 and after 7.Nxd4 Nxd4 8.Qxd4 we have the exchange variation.  But with this move...
1060,37,10,d5,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B1Pp3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I was going to drive the N back.  The idea being is that black has lost tempo as her Nc5 will be forced to move again.  And I will be able to use that time to develop another piece.

The reason is interference as now her Re8 is blocked by her own Knight.  Therefore this was going to win a pawn.  So as Homework I asked went back right after 7.d5 was played and asked her to find the best move.  It was a quiz but I overlooked something which is how she got the right answer.  In it Sue said that what she analyzed is that if I took the pawn she'd take it back or I'd lose a piece.  She was right which I mentioned and thus ammended the other comment.  What I missed was after 8.Nxe5 8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 and without my Nc3 there she could take with 9...Nxe4.

In part what happened at work got to me here but I'm still angry with myself for making the terrible mistake.  The idea being as kenfiore_3 pointed out is that a teacher is not supposed to give the student an advantage like this.  First I played this in part because I thought that this eliminated the possibility of ...Bxc3 followed by bxc3 which would get back a pawn.  And I at first thought that if she took and I recaptured it was still even.  But that isn't so.  It is still possible and in the after she will play 10...axb5  @Sue: I kept this a secret but it's now important for you to know.  The main reason this happened was Flip Coin Chess (where you don't take enough time to analyze) and I realized this before 9...Bxc3.  It happened while visualizing the position once I logged off that's when I realized what I had done.  What happened at work is that 5 people got sick and thus had to call out that week.  Normally I can just get over it since it would happen once and then we move on.  But those 5 days were in a row and three times we were short.  Of those times I wound up having to suffer twice since I was on.  Not having enough staff is very stressful but I should not have allowed this to get to me.  Instead it should've been put aside so the focus could be on chess.  With that you did an excellent job in taking advantage of my mistake.  And for a while it will be very difficult as I will struggle to find counterplay.  This will not only take visualization at work but I'll be forced to visualize at spin.  In fact let's compare because there are levels of gear and then speed.  The scale ranges from 1-10 with 10 being the highest gear.  Of those number I had to crank up the gear to 8.5-9 with the equivalent of a fast sprint to think about what to do here.
1065,37,15,1Re1,b'r1bqr1k1/1pppnppp/5n2/1p1PN3/3QP3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Yet chess is not easy which is something I also wanted this student to learn.  So with that being said I am thinking along the lines of TA's Q sacs where he wins after giving up his Q for the f2 or f7 pawn.  Therefore I realized that against this student I might be able to get counterplay as I did with superandy when I blundered my Queen early.  I also realize that she might not allow me to get counterplay and should even win.  Bearing in mind that I could lose if it was going to happen I was not going to make easy for knightrider to win.  The idea is that a student could learn even if they won but you must make it very difficult as easy19 does this.  That's what happened with Mary.  When I coached she won but also learned and something important became second nature due to how difficult I made it for her.
1066,37,16,1d6,b'r1bqr1k1/1pp1nppp/3p1n2/1p1PN3/3QP3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I figured that she'd go after my N which is also why I played 11.Re1  The idea being was after pulling back e4-e5 and then after exchanging pawns responding with d5-d6 and after exchanging playing Qc5 at some point when it's safe to do so.  It's worth noting that I'm following the same strategies that archduke_piccolo used against redfoxrising to win a similar position like this.  Like me he was also clinging believe it or not as he I believe lost a Rook for Knight.  So likewise he got aggressive and didn't hold anything back.  In doing so Ron only made one mistake but lost.  And we must also keep in mind that I have learned from ION and he is also one reason why I'm able to coach and mentor players as he does things like the legendary Jack Stockel.  So his style of teaching is also similar to my style of learning.  Therefore we also think alike.

Yes if she doesn't find the right response I will get a pawn back.  But if Sue does then I wind up in trouble as I'll be forced to liquidate further on top of what I noted earlier with my Kg1.
1069,37,19,Bg4,b'r2qr1k1/1pp1nppp/3p1B2/1p1P4/3QP1b1/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',After the blunder I stopped mentoring shortly as Sue was playing flawless until here.  But this is where it resumes.  Like before I went back to 14.Bxf6 but this time I did something different.  I followed another method from tactical-abyss and my student analyze and play the moves as though I were playing as black.  That's because in his visualization thread which is more or less the same way I do it he said the same thing that stalhandske made me do as Homework at WTWLTR.  When I suggested a move he made me play as if the opponent's move to figure out why that move was bad.  The moral there is also playing as your opponent so that you learn.  But this time she got the answer.  In it I said  You are playing extremely well and after the blunder I made a few days ago which lost a piece for a pawn it was a struggle for me to get back in the game. However after I played 14.Bxf6 you responded with 14...Bg4 The problem is that with this move I can get a pawn back  So going back in time before your retreat but after my capture I was thinking of something different. It is good practice as well as per TA's suggestion which is playing on the opposite side (from the opponent's POV.) So let's suppose that I were playing as black. In this position how would I have responded to prevent this?  And she accurately said 14...gxf6 leading to 15.gxf3.
1070,37,20,Ng6,b'r2qr1k1/1pp2pBp/3p2n1/1p1P4/3QP1b1/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',On good thing which is important note is that her N is now in a good spot.  Therefore I view as the best move.

But at the same time I asked myself if there were threats before playing this.  The reason I played 16.f3 as opposed to 16.h3 is because I knew that Sue would find the right response.  And when she does I wind up with a more solid pawn chain.
1072,37,22,1Bf6,b'r2qr1k1/1ppb1p1p/3p1Bn1/1p1P4/3QP3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3R1K1 b - -',Still doing about anything I come right after her Q.

But as we're about to see black is going to wind up in some trouble because your Knight on g6 added some protection. By moving it that changes. Therefore I'm not sure what the best move was but much better was 17...Qc8 or 17...Qb8  @Sue: The reason being is that with my next I will equalize (fully recompensate for lost material.)  That is because your Ne7 is indirectly pinned to your Queen.
1074,37,24,f6,b'r2qr1kB/1ppbn2p/3p1p2/1p1P4/3QP3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3R1K1 w - -',! Best as it's the only move to prevent mate without losing material.  @Sue: I'd like to look at something else which I also visualized at work.  The only option aside from that was 18...Nf5 but then 19.exf5 and if 19...Rxe1! 20.Rxe1 so not only have you lost a piece.  But I would have further liquidated.

But there was just one move move that I overlooked but that was before she found it.  So I edited that.  Therefore I at first said ?? While this move prevents mate it is however a blunder believe it or not. There is another place the Knight could have gone to stop the threat. Therefore what was the best move?  And she accurately guessed 20...Ng6  After seeing what I overlooked I changed it to Yes that was slightly better. Though I overlooked one thing as there is still a way around the loss of material which she finds after I threaten Qg7#  That is especially since the pin is broken.
1078,37,28,Qc8,b'r1q1r3/1ppb1k1p/3p1B2/1p1P4/3QP3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3R1K1 w - -',?? Now I didn't have to give her Homework here because Sue accurately told me that she made a blunder.  When I analyzed I realized yes it was.  So I added something to introduce my student to the concept of studying variations as that is how one improves.  In it I said Yes it was. Best was as you might guess 22...Qxf6 and then would come 23.Qxf6+ Kxf6 after which it's even.  But with this move black will be a piece down.
1079,37,29,2Bg5,b'r1q1r3/1ppb1k1p/3p4/1p1P2B1/3QP3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3R1K1 b - -',The idea here was to threaten mate my next move which would do damage.

But there was a danger that got overlooked. I'm not sure exactly what the best move would've been but your King ought to have moved. With this move however black winds up in serious trouble.""  I wasn't going to state it directly as otherwise knightrider62 might get nervous and therefore would make more mistakes.  I also did not want her to feel rushed because sometimes one doesn't mean it but when directly state the fact it makes the other person feel rushed.  I know because I made that mistake.  But what I'm implying without having that happen is that this move will cost her a Rook+Queen for a Bishop. "

This loses immeidately as now I will mate you. There was only one move that could've kept you in longer and it was 25...Re7 Yes you would lose a Rook after 26.Qxe7 and to prevent mate after that the only option would be 26...Qf8 with 27.Bxf8 Kxf8. So in addition to the Rook you'd also lose the Queen for a bishop. But that is also why 23...c6?? was a blunder. Instead 23...Kf8 or 23...Kg8 were needed. No good would've been 23...Kg6 because of 24.Qf6# But yes moving the pawn to c6 got you in a lot of trouble and by advancing the b pawn it was mate. A good lesson is to evaluate what works or not. When looking at moves try and figure the big picture about how things are unfolding and where the real danger. Missing that could put you in trouble.
1085,37,35,2Qg7#,b'r1q1r1k1/1p1b2Qp/2pp3B/3P4/1p2P3/2P2P2/P1P3PP/R3R1K1 b - -',"At this point I summed it all up by saying Overall you did play very well and are improving but I left notes from the game chat right before mate. As noted it is important to see the big picture on what's going in the game and how it's unfolding. There were threats that were overlooked by advancing the c pawn which from there things went downhill as I'd now get a Rook+Queen for a Bishop. And by advancing the b pawn it was mate. Remembering those things will help you improve but your play was about 250 points north of your rating.  So she said ""Thanks joe I really think I played badly towards the end of the game though. Usually I look at the board several times between moves but I failed to do this and moved to quickly on my moves.""  And I responded by saying Your welcome and I understand that feeling too well. Something like this happened to me a few weeks ago when coaching Mary as I was running low on time. And I made a terrible blunder that lost in a won position. But that's how we learn and I agree that taking your time is the way to go.  However @Sue: From beginning to the end so the entire time it is important to look at everything and take your time.  Even when one has the advantage analysis is still needed because if you fail to do that and let your guard down he or she still can take advantage and win.  A perfect example as noted earlier in the annotation is TA's Queen Sacs."

Now I was originally going to continue with 5. f2-f4 but I realised that in that position Qd8-h4 check is very strong for him. However I though so what? I can develop a little and then play it at a later stage.
1134,39,10,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/2P1P3/4B2P/PP3PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',So I continue my development.

I think white is better here with the two bishops and the greater space advantage. Plus I out-rated him and didn't want to lose the grading points.

Also I was aware that they out-graded us on the lower boards and the team rather needed a win from me (in fact as it turned out this win was crucial as we drew the match 2.5 points each."

I thought it led to a concrete advantage for me but I am not sure it does and the knights prefer a closed position and this move closes up the queen side making his knights better. I wondered if c4-c5 was better trying to open up the position for my bishops with Bd3-b5 in the air. I set up this position on a computer. At first it liked b4-b5 but then looked at Bc2 (presumably en route to a4. In the ned the computer settled on 23.

1214,39,90,4Rg8+,b'2k3R1/2p5/1p1pK3/pP6/2P1P1P1/r7/8/8 b - -',I throw in a check to drive his king further away.
1215,39,91,4Kb7,b'6R1/1kp5/1p1pK3/pP6/2P1P1P1/r7/8/8 w - -',This is forced too.
1216,39,92,4g5,b'6R1/1kp5/1p1pK3/pP4P1/2P1P3/r7/8/8 b - -',I advance!
1217,39,93,4Rc3,b'6R1/1kp5/1p1pK3/pP4P1/2P1P3/2r5/8/8 w - -',Computer now says a5-a4 is best for black and assesses the position as equal!
1218,39,94,4g6,b'6R1/1kp5/1p1pK1P1/pP6/2P1P3/2r5/8/8 b - -',So I allow my c and e pawns to go in order to push my g pawn.
1219,39,95,4Rxc4,b'6R1/1kp5/1p1pK1P1/pP6/2r1P3/8/8/8 w - -',This is his losing mistake.
1220,39,96,4g7,b'6R1/1kp3P1/1p1pK3/pP6/2r1P3/8/8/8 b - -',I push again.
1221,39,97,4Rxe4+,b'6R1/1kp3P1/1p1pK3/pP6/4r3/8/8/8 w - -',He takes. Now in this position I have one move that wins I think all others lose!
1222,39,98,5Kf5,b'6R1/1kp3P1/1p1p4/pP3K2/4r3/8/8/8 b - -',And it is this move preventing his rook from getting to the g file.
1223,39,99,5Re1,b'6R1/1kp3P1/1p1p4/pP3K2/8/8/8/4r3 w - -',He retreats his rook.
1224,39,100,5Rf8,b'5R2/1kp3P1/1p1p4/pP3K2/8/8/8/4r3 b - -',Rh8 or d8 also wins. Forced to give up his rook for the g pawn his position is now hopeless and he resigned. Many thanks for reading my annotation. Please add a comment or two and rate it on the start system. Until next time dear reader!
