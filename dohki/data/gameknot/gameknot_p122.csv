Unbeknownst to my opponent I am both familiar with the Wing Gambit and a little stronger player than the ""1200 rating"" indicates. A word of advice to the wise chess competitor: *ALWAYS* come to the board prepared to play for blood; put your best game out there and don't screw around. Play against *EVERY* opponent as if you believe he's really a Grandmaster regardless of what his actual rating may be. It will make you a better player.


For the comments made at this position:
---drchopper:
First I enjoy playing the Wing Gambit on occasion. I like playing the Danish too. And these days my main weapon against 1. ...f5 is a little bit of inspired psychosis called the Krejcik Gambit. But let's be serious: the Wing Gambit stands at the edge of the theoretical abyss - i.e. it's *barely* sound. Any competent defender is going to make White's life miserable (...look what I just did to a 2196 player!) even if he doesn't get better than a draw out of the game. But White isn't usually playing for a draw so if he ends up with one his intent to win has been effectively thwarted wouldn't you agree?

You want proof of the WG's lack of serious reputation? Then just compare the frequency with which any variation of it is played at the Grandmaster level relative to any non-gambit variation of the Sicilian or even to such optimistic White-side Sicilian gambits as the Smith-Morra. Sure Fischer used a variation of the WG to beat up on Boris Spassky in their second match; but he assayed the opening as a surprise ...and Spassky was cooperatively surprised. But let's also observe drchopper that with a rating of 1549 you're ""a fer piece"" from playing like Bobby Fischer (as am I let's add). Bottom line: the WG is fun to play against the small fry and every third blue moon or so it can even be useful as a shock weapon against peer and stronger competition - as long as you're willing to accept the consequence of getting embarrassingly thumped for your impertinence. But is it something you'd play with the kind of frequency that allows your opponents to *expect* it from you and thus make preparations for it? ...Huh! Not a chance.

---coolistdude:
Emmanuel Lasker a World Champion who held the title for 27 years was a psychologist by training. His advice for playing chess? ""Play the board not the man."" Gambits aren't simply devices to getting under you opponent's skin although they certainly can. But every mainstream gambit from the Queens Gambit to the Benko Gambit to the Kings Gambit shares a trait: they all offer material (usually a pawn) in exchange for some sort of playable advantage."

Will have to see how this pans out. I might of chosen c6 to allow the space in d7 to remain open for my queen. I do like the flexibility of not having to castle so quick that you have not telegraphed your play to the openent. I do think the queen will be out and eventually make black the ability to castle on the queens side.

136,7,9,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/3p4/2p5/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',?? I chose this candidate to play another powerful fork between his LSB and d3 pawn.  However this is not good because he will win a free pawn so I will be a point behind.  It is usually not so bad but this will become a problem.  In fact it is worse then you might think.  
137,7,10,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/3p4/2P5/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',That is because I cannot recapture with 6...dxc4 or he will force a queen exchange with 7.Qxd8+ Kxe8.  According to Mr. Stockel a queen exchange will put you at a strategical advantage as it will take away your chance to castle in this situation. 
138,7,11,Be6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',! I moved my LSB to protect my d5 pawn.  As I had mentioned earlier 6...dxc4? due to the queen exchange.  Therefore this was my best move.

That is because I just blundered my LSB so I will be 4 points behind instead of 1 when 8.Bxd5 is played.  In addition I will not be able to respond with 8...Qxd5 or I will loose my queen because he will respond with 9.Qxd5.
141,7,14,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3B4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',? As a result I attempt to chase his LSB away but it will not work because he will pin my f6 knight with 9.Bg5.
142,7,15,Qb6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/1q3n2/3B2B1/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',I also could have broken the pin with 9...h6 but I did not want to do that.  Instead I wanted to attack his a1 rook and win his b2 pawn but what was I thinking?  A pawn swap usually looses a chess game in this position as inadowman mentioned in my last annotation.  In addition I might have also violated general opening principles.  That is because you are not supposed to bring your queen out so early but this is move 9 not 2-4.  Therefore I do not know if this move was a ?. 
143,7,16,1Bxf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/1q3B2/3B4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',? I understand that he wanted to exchange pieces because he is ahead but the exchange is not good due to the postion.  This is afterall an open position so a bishop is worth more then a knight.  
144,7,17,1Qxf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/5q2/3B4/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',?? This was a serious blunder.  I should have recaptured with 10...gxf6 but I did not want doubled pawns (two pawns on one file).  There are times when doubled pawns are ok but I abhor them.  That is because I believe that they weaken my position even if they are ok or an advantage.  Of course I do not usually know when doubled pawns are ok unless you are going to castle or connect your rooks.  In this position however they would have been a serious tactical and strategical advantage. 
145,7,18,1Bxb7,b'rn2kb1r/pB3ppp/5q2/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',!! This enables him to attack my a8 rook and capture my b7 pawn.  In this position he will win my a8 rook no matter what I do.  BTW I have not been able to able to capture a pawn and win a rook with a lonely LSB.  
146,7,19,1Qxb2,b'rn2kb1r/pB3ppp/8/8/8/8/PqP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',!! Therefore I capture his b2 pawn and will win his a1 rook.  This is the most unusual position that I have seen in all the years that I have been playing chess.

156,7,29,1Nc6,b'r6Q/pB2kppp/2n5/4q3/1b6/5K2/P1P2PPP/1N4NR w - -',!! I made this move to give him my other rook so this is the Deflective Sacrifice not a blunder.  After 18.Qxa8 the game will be lost for white even with a +9.  Until this game I have resigned after falling behind by 9 points.

In fact Mr. Stockel would say ""Don't give things away"".  However Deflective Sacrifices are good because you are sacrificing material for something better including but not limited to a queen capture or mating sequence.  Therefore this game proves that you can generally defeat your opponent with Deflective Sacrifices.  BTW I already knew the definition of a Deflective Sacrifice but I learned about its usefulness from a grandmaster (i have arrived).

Moving the f pawn right in the beginning look to break the defense but give later another piece ready to pierce the defense of the oponent. It looklike a wild opening but with a correct defense it's just create a very balanced game as the bishop opening.

223,12,1,c6,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',An okay defensive move. Black really needs to get his pieces out though.

This is usually not a good idea in a game but sometimes in blitz aggressive moves pay off since there is not as much time to analyze. This move does win a pawn.

Things can't be worse for me here lol.  After looking at this position for a long while I knew I had to open up the middle of the board and get my rooks into play.  Black has a great advantage but half his pieces aren't in use.  If I could open up the board a little bit and get my pieces into play faster than Black I may have a chance.

In doing so he has opened up the h file for himself again.  Black still has a superior position so trading pieces isn't too bad of an idea at this point.
488,19,33,2Bxg5,b'r1q4r/4k1b1/1p1p1n2/pBpPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/R6R b - -',By trading knights Black ends up with his other knight pinned.  Also note that I have now connected my two rooks.  If Black decides to swap rooks I'll end up with my other rook on the H-file.  Trading rooks isn't really an option for either of us right now.  There is a lot of tension on the h-file but whoever eats the other's rook first will lose control of it.
489,19,34,2Qb7,b'r6r/1q2k1b1/1p1p1n2/pBpPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/R6R w - -',Black chooses not to trade rooks on h1.  Instead Black brings the focus to the center of the board attacking the d4 pawn but this will only work after he unpins his knight.  Another mistake here:  The obvious skewer which I play on the next move.  It was so obvious I determined it to be bait and a sacrifice of his rook so I hesitated for a very long time before I made the move because I thought something may be fishy.  I'll explain on the next move...
490,19,35,2Bc6,b'r6r/1q2k1b1/1pBp1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/R6R b - -',Here's the skewer.  Here I thought Black was going to give up his rook which isn't even in the game so that he can sneak his queen past the pawn line and into my sacred area.  His next move would be to move his queen to a6 letting me eat the rook and then his queen can slide right in.  I decided that I may be able to tolerate this because I have enough defense at the moment to hold off the queen so I accepted this position.
491,19,36,2Bxa8,b'B6r/4k1b1/qp1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/R6R b - -',Here is where Black's queen can sneak in and do some damage but Black is now down in material and decides to try and keep the game equal as possible by taking my Bishop...

I wanted to try and swing my queen around thru the g and h files for an attack but now I'm stuck defending the d5 pawn unless I give it other support.  I need more pieces in play...
493,19,38,2Rae1,b'q6r/4k1b1/1p1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R2R b - -',Purely positional placing my rook under Black's king.  Here I started trying to find a way to sacrifice a piece by eating on e5.  Right now I see this as my only way to Black's king.  The positions of both sides here are starting to look more equal and I'm able to breathe again.
494,19,39,2Rb8,b'qr6/4k1b1/1p1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R2R w - -',I think that here is where Black blew it.  He gives up control of the H-file again and places his rook in a terrible spot.  My only rationale for this is that he is trying to attack on my very weak side probably ready to push the b5 pawn forward and open up that side of the board.
495,19,40,2Rh7,b'qr6/4k1bR/1p1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R3 b - -',I pin yet another piece of Black's so now I have 4 pieces in play against Black's rook and queen who are nowhere near to defend his King.  Things are looking great for me.
496,19,41,2Kf7,b'qr6/5kbR/1p1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R3 w - -',This move is almost forced to prevent my rook from taking the bishop.  Other option would have been to swing the rook back to g8 which would have been better.  I looked at this position for a very long time playing out many scenarios in my head.  I had a couple of great ideas.  First moving my e1 rook over to h1 would give me a powerful attack on the right side of the board.  My other idea was to get my queen around the corner to join the attack but any wrong move I made would allow Black's queen to eat at d5 and put me in check.  I also nearly played c4 in order to prevent that but that may have lost me a tempo and allowed Black to swing his rook back to the defense.  I wanted to continue my attack while Black's strong pieces were away from the action.  I could have also eaten the knight with my bishop saving my rook from an attack while chipping away at his defense but then I saw the greatest combination that I've ever played.  It is a mate in 9 moves.  Can you see it?  Here it is...
497,19,42,2Rxg7+,b'qr6/5kR1/1p1p1n2/p1pPpPB1/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R3 b - -',Impossible to resist Black will take this rook.
498,19,43,3Bh6+,b'qr6/6k1/1p1p1n1B/p1pPpP2/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R3 b - -',A free bishop?  Black probably thought I made a careless mistake.  Impossible to resist.
499,19,44,3Kxh6,b'qr6/8/1p1p1n1k/p1pPpP2/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/4R3 w - -',Now I'm down in material and any wrong move will let Black's queen come thru the middle and finish me off.  I've just sucked Black's king against the side of the board so I must continue to pound on him.
500,19,45,Kg7,b'qr6/6k1/1p1p1n2/p1pPpP2/P7/5Q2/1PP2PK1/7R w - -',Black may have been better off coming to g5 as that would have ended my forced move combination but when I saw this position a few moves back I thought the risk of that was really low and Black would not want to bring his King closer in towards me especially with my queen so close to him.
501,19,46,3Rh8+,b'qr1k3R/6Q1/1p1p1n2/p1pPpP2/P7/8/1PP2PK1/8 b - -',"Game over.  Black resigned here.  He can not prevent the mate even though he has more material.  There is just no defense available for Black.  Also note how effective my earlier pin on his knight was.  The knight is still in the same spot it was.  That pin essentially removed the knight from the game.

Hope you enjoyed."

553,23,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening. This is the most common move leading to the Stonewall Attack. Other's include the 'Closed Blocker': 1. e3 and the Bird's Opening: 1. f4. A last one which is now often seen is 1. Nc3 or 1. Nf3. All these possibilities all lead to the same attack but the extremely common ones are 1. d4 and 1. Nc3.
554,23,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',After 1. d4 I usually open up with 1. ... Nf6 stopping 2. e4 or 1. ... e6 trying to open a line for my DSB. This is known as the 'Closed Blocker with Colours Reversed' or as in an example after 1. e4 e6 it is then named after the foul but fabulous French 'The French Defence'. But this serious but relaxing move: 1. ... d5 mentions key features of the Queen's Pawn Game.
555,23,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Strictly speaking White makes this text move because he is trying to steer the play into the Pawn Pattern which he has observed and with which you will become familiar. From a theoretical point of view White's move has certain advantages and certain disadvantages. Thus White will now be able to develop his LSB. This is a factor of the greatest importance as the bishop will play a big role in White's coming plans. True e3 blocks white's DSB but that does not matter yet at this point. 
556,23,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is an excellent developing move which has the merit of controlling e4 and preparing for castling. Also this secures Black's position before he comfortably counter-attacks/attacks. Also if the greatest move 3. f4?! is played then Black can reply with the miraculous 3. ... Ne4! establishing a strong outpost in the centre. 
557,23,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',! This is one of the key moves in White's development. The Bishop move prepares for castling sets up the bishop on a strong diagonal and disputes many glisters of control on the vital square: e4. In addition it also stops 4. ... Ne4?! after 4. f4! without risking doubled pawns for Black. Plus when Black has castled the bishop will also be eyeing the h7 pawn and the f5 square.
558,23,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black follows suit preparing for his development of his DSB (main bishop). Black also makes this text move because he is trying to build a critical pawn structure and defend easily also counter-attacking on the queenside. This move as seen with White's 2. e3 also has certain advantages and also certain disadvantages including the blockade of his LSB but the strong a3-f8 diagonal suited for his DSB.
559,23,6,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White intends to play 5. e4 which is one of the characteristic moves of his Pawn Pattern. Once 5. e4 has been played Black can consequently bring out his other knight without causing much danger to White's adequate position.
560,23,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq c6',! A good move theoretically as it engages d-pawn and thus minimizes somewhat White's pressure on e5. Of course White would not dream of playing 5. dxc5? as that would relax his grip of the valuable square e5 and this allows Black to develop another piece after 5. ... Bxc5.
561,23,8,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',! White supports the d-pawn and also retreats for the LSB along the powerful diagonal.
562,23,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black aims to develop his knight and faintly press on the e5 square and somewhat threatens to play 6. ... e5!! or 6. ... Be7! and finally the light 6. ... Bd7!? This forces White to play 6. f4! which prevents Black from playing the vital 6. ... e5!!  and launches the unique Stonewall Pawn Structure. Note that 6. ... c4? would have released the grip on the tight pawn chains of White's personalized structure delete his faint but solid attack on the queenside and after that White can still play 7. Bc2! without any catastrophes or any major disruptions. Plus it would still be controlling the b1-h5 diagonal which is a very important piece of the board for White's attack (The Stonewall Attack).  
563,23,10,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',! This move completes the Stonewall pawn pattern (although maybe rots the kingside). Now we have 6. ... e5  permanently prevented and White prepares to anchor his King Knight at a powerful outpost following 7. Ngf3! Also White keeps the majority of his pawns on Black squares where his LSB will be extremely powerful (not to mention his useless DSB). Now we begin to see how the Stonewall Pattern got its name!

Be7! which indirectly defends Black's Kingside when the knight on f6 has moved. Another option would have been to 'fianchetto' Black's DSB but it would take an extra developing move in the opening although the positive fact is that it would have given his Kingside extra protection.

White has now achieved his opening objectives: He has set up the Stonewall Pawn pattern which gives him a firm grip on the centre; he has posted his LSB at d3 with strong attacking prospects and he has brought his King Knight to e5 emphasizing his grip on the centre.

Bb7!? which is not very useful at this moment (until later on) because White is strongly developing and attacking and Black needs to think about defending himself and not concerning too much on developing Queenside pieces in two/three moves. 9. ... Bd7 is still fairly OK and comfortable and even after 10. ... Bd7!? White would not even think about playing 11. Nxd7? as Black would relax after 11. ... Qxd7. Note that after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? Nxd7?! would leave Black's valuable h7 pawn undefended. Still after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? White would have an uncomfortable time strengthening his grip on the centre and attack. 
571,23,18,1g4,b'r1b2rk1/p1q1bppp/1pn1pn2/2ppN3/3P1PP1/2PBP3/PP1N3P/R1BQ1RK1 b - g3',!? White's violent thrust of the King Knight pawn is made with several objectives in mind. His basic idea is to drive away black's king knight so his Bishop can be freely attacking h7. The downside is that White's kingside is also weakened but at the moment the Black Queen must wait until it can make use of the h2-b8 diagonal and the Bishop on e7 needs a tempo to reach h4 where it will dominate a specific but extremely fierce attack when the Black Queen gets to a place like h3 where it is safe and provides a powerful attack for Black. If Black's LSB reaches h3 his DSB reaching h4 and his queen dominating the g-file from a safe distance and possibly a knight placed on g4 or f3 White would be in big trouble! But all this can and must wait.

The point is that after 11. ... Nxe5! 12. fxe5 Black would be able (after 10 ... Bb7) to play 12...Ne4!! establishing and maintaining an outpost of his own. White's attacking plans would be disrupted which means that his structure will weaken."

Is he waiting to see how White's plan carefully unfolds? Has he got a plan of defence or counterattack of his own? Perhaps he will play 12. ... b5?! or maybe he is just waiting for White to make a silly mistake? Maybe his Rooks will get developed next after 12. ... Rfe8 or 12. Rad8 then? Or maybe is it that after 12. ... b5?! he will play 13. ... c4!? Maybe 11. a6?! was just to give the b5 square and the f1-a6 diagonal extra additional protection that was not necessarily needed? Isn't it amazing how many extraordinary but weird thoughts come up in your head when you are battling through Chess. Whose fault? Yours? No but you have just got to cope with it.

Is it a valuable square where Black can safely counterattack threatening to move a key piece of white's for example d7? Or is it just a silly square like e8? A blundered square like e4? Or a vital destruction of White's property a safe counterattack like 12. ... Nxe5? Or is Black just willing to sacrifice his knight for a positional advantage like the dubious 12. ... b5?! 13. gxf6 Bxf6 14. Qh5 h6!? 15. Rd3 b4?!

Plus White could be threatening mate at any time on h7! Personally I find this move quite hilarious! Knights on the rim are dim! Well this knight has only got one safe square to go to. Certainly dim! As I said I find this move quite hilarious with no major positive opinions for this absurd novice-like move. I would personally play 12. ... Nd7! threatening to swap off White's precious knight on e5. However this knight move has a special disadvantage as you will find out on the next great move.

This sacrifice is the logical outcome of the Bishop's menacing position on the diagonal. Black's dominant casted position now becomes so vulnerable that his king may be exposed to a mating attack!
578,23,25,1Kxh7,b'r3nr2/1bq1bppk/ppn1p3/2ppN1P1/3P1P2/2P1PQ2/PP1N3P/R1B2RK1 w - -',13. ... Kh8 would be even worse as it fails to a carefully woven and prepared discovered check after 14. Qh3/Qh5 and his valuable h7 pawn would've been lost without any material or positional gain. Now Black's structure is completely foiled even though white is a very unfortunate two points down.
579,23,26,1Qh5+,b'r3nr2/1bq1bppk/ppn1p3/2ppN1PQ/3P1P2/2P1P3/PP1N3P/R1B2RK1 b - -',This vital check forces Black's king to move back to g8 where White can plan to arrange other attacks by feeding in more pieces.

582,23,29,1g6,b'r3nrk1/1bq1bp2/ppn1p1p1/2ppN1PQ/3P1P2/2P1PR2/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',This still offers some fight whereas after something else (i.e. 15. ... Rd8) White can play 16. g6! and mate follows at once.
583,23,30,1Qh6,b'r3nrk1/1bq1bp2/ppn1p1pQ/2ppN1P1/3P1P2/2P1PR2/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 b - -',This move keeps the detailed and knitted structure of the strong attack of Rh3 and the follow-up of checkmate. 16. Qh4?! is dubious as this disables the advance of the g5 pawn once the second-to-last vulnerable g6 pawn has vanished. Black would also be willing to equal the material by playing 16. ... Bxg5?! anytime.
584,23,31,1Ng7,b'r4rk1/1bq1bpn1/ppn1p1pQ/2ppN1P1/3P1P2/2P1PR2/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',Valiantly trying to shield his King and get one piece into defence whereas more White pieces can join into attack. This is why the g6 pawn advanced to let a little hole fit for the knight on g7. As I said if a Dragon Bishop was located on g7 instead of the knight then White's queen would've been unable to settle on the fearsome h6 square. 
585,23,32,1Rh3,b'r4rk1/1bq1bpn1/ppn1p1pQ/2ppN1P1/3P1P2/2P1P2R/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 b - -',"! This move bursts the smoothie. It causes an earthquake! Now White has three pieces in attack: The Queen and Rook lined up on the h-file and the knight greatly posted on the strong outpost of e5! Thus Mate in 1 follows at once unless Black plays the almost-quite safe and almost-quite secure move which results in a confusion moment for White but what is it? What is this particular saving move for Black then?

His knight blocks the all-important h-file preventing the execution of White's mating threat. White is a piece behind so he cannot afford to give up now. Another sacrifice is called for! Another fighting period! Another winning move! Another hint of no-giving up for a wide crunch of clear purposes. And what is this specific but brilliant move of heaven?
587,23,34,1Nxg6,b'r4rk1/1bq1bp2/ppn1p1NQ/2pp2Pn/3P1P2/2P1P2R/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 b - -',!! Breaking Black's position wide open. The availability of the knight for this sacrifice is a tribute to the power of this piece on the dominating square e5! The threat of19. Qh8# is to be met again and black is left with no choice but with the subtle and regretful 18. ... fxg6.
588,23,35,1fxg6,b'r4rk1/1bq1b3/ppn1p1pQ/2pp2Pn/3P1P2/2P1P2R/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',Black can now relax (for the moment) but his kingside is in parts. How is he going to manage? But how is White going to manage? He can win a second pawn back after this knight sacrifice but he will still be three points down so in other words how is he going to continue this menacing and vicious attack? 
589,23,36,1Qxg6+,b'r4rk1/1bq1b3/ppn1p1Q1/2pp2Pn/3P1P2/2P1P2R/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 b - -',This is the obvious move even for Grandmasters. Unhinging the support of Black's Knight at h5 is an important factor of the Stonewall Attack yet we can now see that Black's knight is lost due to a fork and with it the game. But all is not easy for Grandmasters! They have a back-up survival move in their minds. The answer is that Black must interpose with his knight (19. ... Ng7) whereas if you don't think twice about it with 19. ... Kh8? follows with 20. Rxh5# checkmate.
590,23,37,1Ng7,b'r4rk1/1bq1b1n1/ppn1p1Q1/2pp2P1/3P1P2/2P1P2R/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',Here we have a tense moment. A knight and bishop for three pawns in an non-understandable piece of information and exchanges. So White has to earn back a piece in this game from now. But as White is 3 points down it looks like his hopes are all gone! So how is he going to exert extra pressure on Black's king and push forward the strong attack?
591,23,38,2Rh7,b'r4rk1/1bq1b1nR/ppn1p1Q1/2pp2P1/3P1P2/2P1P3/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 b - -',The Rook is made nearer to Black's king and threatens 21. Qxg7#. Black needs to clear the rank so he can defend the knight with his queen by moving the Bishop but still things will be tough for him. If a Bishop gets himself to h6 (and it will) then Black's dreams are doomed. The lost piece won't matter since all the others will be cheering for happiness. But again this can still be delayed. There is no need for this to be immediate. So good plan but how is this to be acted out? How is the heart of this game to be linked in with the danger and pressure near Black's vulnerable King and his poor defending knight and not to forget his naughty Rook on f8 taking up all his space?
592,23,39,2Bd6,b'r4rk1/1bq3nR/ppnbp1Q1/2pp2P1/3P1P2/2P1P3/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',! This saves the day for the moment as it enables the Queen to protect the all-important knight on g7 through the rank for the minute only. It is possible that White can see the light to enable him to return material and possibly win the game. This would be ideal for him but this is only for starters. What's the move for the main?

This is a nice plan but it involves a major sacrifice of material which returns pieces back to White. Still his game will extend by a couple of moves which is still an advantage.

598,23,45,2Rg4+,b'r5k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1PQ/2pp4/3P2r1/2P5/PP1N3P/R1B3K1 w - -',Now that is the one and only way to stop mate. 24. Kh1 Rxg6 25. Qxg6 loses a whole range of material for Black but that sure stops White's mating threat!
599,23,46,2Kh1,b'r5k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1PQ/2pp4/3P2r1/2P5/PP1N3P/R1B4K b - -',White's king hides in the corner. 24. Kf1 is a mistake because black would play 24 ... Qf4+! threatening an exchange of White's powerful queen against Black's weak queen. 24. Kf2 would fail to the exchange as well. 
600,23,47,2Rxg6,b'r5k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1rQ/2pp4/3P4/2P5/PP1N3P/R1B4K w - -',And as I said this is the only way to stop mate though it allows a sacrifice of a Rook only gaining a vital pawn. Still what is more important the game or just a poor and shaggy old good-for-nothing chariot?
601,23,48,2Qxg6,b'r5k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1Q1/2pp4/3P4/2P5/PP1N3P/R1B4K b - -',White is now the exchange ahead and his pressure remains unabated (he's two points up now). In one sense it is even stronger than before now that White's DSB is ready to take a hand in the proceedings.
602,23,49,2Rf8,b'5rk1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1Q1/2pp4/3P4/2P5/PP1N3P/R1B4K w - -',Black brings the other Rook in to defence which mightily spoils White's attacking plans for the least of time in the history of the universe.  
603,23,50,2Nf3,b'5rk1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1Q1/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP5P/R1B4K b - -',There are other winning methods but this is certainly the most pleasing. Sacrificing a poor knight in return for a particular winning game is common in other openings but certainly in 'The Stonewall Attack'.
604,23,51,2Rxf3,b'6k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1Q1/2pp4/3P4/2P2r2/PP5P/R1B4K w - -',This is mostly usual but White's DSB will soon be out. Black has now faced with mating threats after 27. Bg6!
605,23,52,2Bh6,b'6k1/1bq3nR/ppn1p1QB/2pp4/3P4/2P2r2/PP5P/R6K b - -',! Setting up a murderous pin. He threatens mate by beginning with RxN+ setting up a tactic called 'The See-Saw' and 'The Guillotine' combined. More like 'The Guillotine See-Saw'!
606,23,53,2Rf7,b'6k1/1bq2rnR/ppn1p1QB/2pp4/3P4/2P5/PP5P/R6K w - -',Black spots the only defence. But now white strengthens the pin.
607,23,54,2Rg1,b'6k1/1bq2rnR/ppn1p1QB/2pp4/3P4/2P5/PP5P/6RK b - -',!! Most impressing as black cannot do anything about this mate. Everything is struggles for Black here and White is actually down by one point! The moral is that the latter is more important as Black has a terrible position while White still has a 'Knock before entering' sign on his door with his only guard the h2-pawn snoozing by the gate (the g1-rook). An activity for you to do is to analyse this position. See what saving and winning moves are in your hands.
608,23,55,2Nxd4,b'6k1/1bq2rnR/pp2p1QB/2pp4/3n4/2P5/PP5P/6RK w - -',?? This doesn't help. Better was 28. Ne5 sacrificing itself but still attacking the queen. 
609,23,56,2Bxg7,b'6k1/1bq2rBR/pp2p1Q1/2pp4/3n4/2P5/PP5P/6RK b - -',This is now typical for Black! The bishop attacks the knight and threatens mate on the move (30. Rh8#). Black must capture with his Rook or else the game is immediately lost on move 30. This lost game for Black is disastrous now and there are no saving moves. It is either mate or a severe material disruption.
610,23,57,2Rxg7,b'6k1/1bq3rR/pp2p1Q1/2pp4/3n4/2P5/PP5P/6RK w - -',?! This is a best try but it loses the queen and more or less the game. A rook goes and more or less the queen and the game. First follows with 30. Rxg7+
611,23,58,3Rxg7+,b'6k1/1bq3R1/pp2p1Q1/2pp4/3n4/2P5/PP5P/6RK b - -',"This wins the queen and the game. Black resigned here seeing that there was no opportunity for Black to win or even draw. After the queen loss for nothing (30. ... Qxg7?? 31. Qxg7#) his game will be sacrificed.

701,24,89,4a4,b'2R5/2P5/5p1p/7k/p4P2/5P1P/2r5/5K2 w - -',I run for it.
702,24,90,4Ke1,b'2R5/2P5/5p1p/7k/p4P2/5P1P/2r5/4K3 b - -',The king is going to threat me.
703,24,91,4a3,b'2R5/2P5/5p1p/7k/5P2/p4P1P/2r5/4K3 w - -',But I ignore it because the threat will do nothing.
704,24,92,4Kd1,b'2R5/2P5/5p1p/7k/5P2/p4P1P/2r5/3K4 b - -',Threatens my rook.
705,24,93,4a2,b'2R5/2P5/5p1p/7k/5P2/5P1P/p1r5/3K4 w - -',Now my opponent can take the rook and I get a queen. Or he can swap pawns.
706,24,94,4Ra8,b'R7/2P5/5p1p/7k/5P2/5P1P/p1r5/3K4 b - -',He decides to swap pawns.
707,24,95,4Rxc7,b'R7/2r5/5p1p/7k/5P2/5P1P/p7/3K4 w - -',I take his advance pawn.
708,24,96,4Rxa2,b'8/2r5/5p1p/7k/5P2/5P1P/R7/3K4 b - -',And he takes mine. Now its a game of few pieces.
709,24,97,4Rc3,b'8/8/5p1p/7k/5P2/2r2P1P/R7/3K4 w - -',I threaten his pawn.
710,24,98,5Ke2,b'8/8/5p1p/7k/5P2/2r2P1P/R3K3/8 b - -',Protects with the king. I can win the h-pawn.
711,24,99,5Kh4,b'8/8/5p1p/8/5P1k/2r2P1P/R3K3/8 w - -',I threaten the h-pawn who has no escape.
712,24,100,5Ra6,b'8/8/R4p1p/8/5P1k/2r2P1P/4K3/8 b - -',So my opponent goes for a swap.
713,24,101,5Kxh3,b'8/8/R4p1p/8/5P2/2r2P1k/4K3/8 w - -',I accept it.
714,24,102,5Rxf6,b'8/8/5R1p/8/5P2/2r2P1k/4K3/8 b - -',He takes my pawn.
715,24,103,5Kg3,b'8/8/5R1p/8/5P2/2r2Pk1/4K3/8 w - -',I threaten his pawn and if he accepts another swap then he will have a pawn and rook and I will have a rook.
716,24,104,5Rg6+,b'8/8/6Rp/8/5P2/2r2Pk1/4K3/8 b - -',He checks me instead. A bad move. I will benefit from this.
717,24,105,5Kxf4,b'8/8/6Rp/8/5k2/2r2P2/4K3/8 w - -',I take his pawn.
718,24,106,5Rg4+,b'8/8/7p/8/5kR1/2r2P2/4K3/8 b - -',He checks me.
719,24,107,5Kf5,b'8/8/7p/5k2/6R1/2r2P2/4K3/8 w - -',I retreat.

723,24,111,5Rc3+,b'8/8/7p/5k2/7R/2r1KP2/8/8 w - -',I check him again.
724,24,112,5Kf2,b'8/8/7p/5k2/7R/2r2P2/5K2/8 b - -',He moves out of the way.
725,24,113,5Rc2+,b'8/8/7p/5k2/7R/5P2/2r2K2/8 w - -',and I check hims yet again.
726,24,114,5Kg3,b'8/8/7p/5k2/7R/5PK1/2r5/8 b - -',He moves out of the way.
727,24,115,5Kg5,b'8/8/7p/6k1/7R/5PK1/2r5/8 w - -',I protect the pawn.
728,24,116,5f4+,b'8/8/7p/6k1/5P1R/6K1/2r5/8 b - -',Checks me while being protected by both king and rook.
729,24,117,5Kg6,b'8/8/6kp/8/5P1R/6K1/2r5/8 w - -',I retreat to my only possible square unless I want to lose a pawn.
730,24,118,6Kf3,b'8/8/6kp/8/5P1R/5K2/2r5/8 b - -',I would of played: Kg4.
731,24,119,6Rc3+,b'8/8/6kp/8/5P1R/2r2K2/8/8 w - -',I check him.
732,24,120,6Ke4,b'8/8/6kp/8/4KP1R/2r5/8/8 b - -',Moves out of the way and now he can push up his pawn.
733,24,121,6Ra3,b'8/8/6kp/8/4KP1R/r7/8/8 w - -',Seeing a possible pin I move as far away as possible.
734,24,122,6f5+,b'8/8/6kp/5P2/4K2R/r7/8/8 b - -',As I thought.
735,24,123,6Kh7,b'8/7k/7p/5P2/4K2R/r7/8/8 w - -',I move behind my pawn.
736,24,124,6Ke5,b'8/7k/7p/4KP2/7R/r7/8/8 b - -',Damn! It was a weak attempt which did not succeed.
737,24,125,6Ra5+,b'8/7k/7p/r3KP2/7R/8/8/8 w - -',Now for the checking spree. Checkâ¦
738,24,126,6Ke6,b'8/7k/4K2p/r4P2/7R/8/8/8 b - -',Moves out of the way.

748,24,136,6Kg3,b'8/7k/7p/5P2/r6R/6K1/8/8 b - -',Moves out of the way and now I can swap a rook for a rook.
749,24,137,6Rxh4,b'8/7k/7p/5P2/7r/6K1/8/8 w - -',I take his rook.
750,24,138,7Kxh4,b'8/7k/7p/5P2/7K/8/8/8 b - -',He takes back. Now its a game with VERY few pieces.
751,24,139,7Kg7,b'8/6k1/7p/5P2/7K/8/8/8 w - -',I move my king toward my opponent's pawn.
752,24,140,7Kh5,b'8/6k1/7p/5P1K/8/8/8/8 b - -',My opponent wants a draw it looks like.
753,24,141,7Kf6,b'8/8/5k1p/5P1K/8/8/8/8 w - -',So do I.
754,24,142,7Kxh6,b'8/8/5k1K/5P2/8/8/8/8 b - -',He takes my pawn.
755,24,143,7Kxf5,b'8/8/7K/5k2/8/8/8/8 w - -',And I take his. The last piece is off the board. Now only the two kings remain. The games drawn!

787,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',For an explanation of the first few moves up to including White's sixth one see Part I ( for comparison: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/tournament-experiences-with-the-reti-gambit-part-i?gm=40285) and Part II (http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/tournament-experiences-with-the-reti-gambit-part-ii?gm=43780) of this annotation series. I consider the move 4... f5 to be unsound which is pointed out in detail in Part II.
788,27,1,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/4p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',"The first deviation from Part II. It's an okay-looking development move though it violates one of the basic opening principles ""Move your knights before your bishops for the reason that in most cases you don't know yet where the bishop has it's best place while for the knight it's often obvious."" I would have prefered 6... Nf6."
789,27,2,Qe2,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb2pp/4p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',Of course White wants to castle as soon as possible so the queen wants to leave. e2 is the better target than d2 since the latter would block the rook on the d-file where the opponents queen is sitting. And as a nice side-effect this also threatens already to win a pawn with Bxf5 in the next move.
790,27,3,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/pppbb1pp/4p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Again prefering bishops moves over knight opening moves but it unpins the pawn e6 thus not allowing Bxf5.
791,27,4,Bf6,b'rn1qk1nr/pppb2pp/4pb2/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/2KR2NR w kq -',? This is bad due to several reasons: first generally moving a piece twice in the opening loses time and is considered to be bad (though there are  exceptions like in the Alekhine opening 1. e4 Nf6 to name the probably most popular counterexample to this rule). Second it blocks the square which would fit perfect for the knight which is still sleeping on g8. Third and in this concrete case probably most critical it enables the simple pawn-winning tactics again by enabling the pin on e6!
792,27,5,Bxf5,b'rn1qk1nr/pppb2pp/4pb2/5B2/8/1PN5/PBP1QPPP/2KR2NR b kq -',And material is even again the opponent has to live with a lonely isolated pawn. Maybe it will be killed soon though...
793,27,6,Qc8,b'rnq1k1nr/pppb2pp/4pb2/5B2/8/1PN5/PBP1QPPP/2KR2NR w kq -',... but Black can avoid that with a queen move again losing time for the opening. I guess there is no other effective way of preventing the loss besides of an other queen move 9... Qe7.
794,27,7,1Nf3,b'rnq1k1nr/pppb2pp/4pb2/5B2/8/1PN2N2/PBP1QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Completing development and connecting rooks -- Black is far away from that point and has not even castled yet. 10. Rxe7 following Bxe6 the next move looks very strong and promising though I was not sure if it's absolutely correct and decided to choose the solid variant.
795,27,8,1Ne7,b'rnq1k2r/pppbn1pp/4pb2/5B2/8/1PN2N2/PBP1QPPP/2KR3R w kq -',Finally one of the knights is leaving the camp. Prepares to castle and unpins the pawn again attacks White's bishop.
796,27,9,1Bg4,b'rnq1k2r/pppbn1pp/4pb2/8/6B1/1PN2N2/PBP1QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Since blocking the d- or e-file was no good option I had to step back at the other direction.
797,27,10,1Rhe1,b'rnq2rk1/pppbn1pp/4pb2/8/6B1/1PN2N2/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b - -',? I classify this move definitely as a mistake (though the advantage is still on White's side) since the material-winning 12. Rxd7! would really not have been too hard to see at that point. Black can't take back or his queen is history (12... Qxd7? 13. Bxe6+). Anyway ignoring that this was possible the rook of course belongs to this file and the e6 pawn is threatened. This piece setup of White arising from the Reti gambit is beautiful isn't it? With the light-squared bishop on c4 instead of g4 it would look perfect in my opinion.
798,27,11,1Nbc6,b'r1q2rk1/pppbn1pp/2n1pb2/8/6B1/1PN2N2/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Black has no effective way of preventing the loss of the pawn on e6 so moving the last minor piece out seems to be the best option.

800,27,13,1Qxe6+,b'r1q2rk1/ppp1n1pp/2n1Qb2/8/8/1PN2N2/PBP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',One might think that a queen exchange which is implied if I want to win that pawn decreases all of Whites advantage dramatically. However due to the very active positions of the rooks and pieces it's not a problem at all.
801,27,14,1Rxe6,b'r4rk1/ppp1n1pp/2n1Rb2/8/8/1PN2N2/PBP2PPP/2KR4 b - -',Yes the ladies are gone and the rooks rule the board now.
802,27,15,1Nf5,b'r4rk1/ppp3pp/2n1Rb2/5n2/8/1PN2N2/PBP2PPP/2KR4 w - -',? Black should have prevented the occupation of the seventh ranks by Rad8/Rfd8!

804,27,17,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pppR2pp/2n1Rb2/5n2/8/1PN2N2/PBP2PPP/2K5 w - -',The c7 pawn was attacked but Black could have got rid of that attack _and_ that powerful rook simply by Rf7.
805,27,18,1Nd5,b'2r2rk1/pppR2pp/2n1Rb2/3N1n2/8/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/2K5 b - -',Centralises the knight and attacks c7 once more.
806,27,19,1Bxb2+,b'2r2rk1/pppR2pp/2n1R3/3N1n2/8/1P3N2/PbP2PPP/2K5 w - -',Black decides to get rid of a very strong fianchetto bishop.

808,27,21,1Nxd4,b'2r2rk1/pppR2pp/4R3/3N1n2/3N4/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 b - -',Now Black can't take back and complete the exchange due to a fork on e7. However strictly in terms of material points speaking losing the Exchange (-2) is still cheaper than losing a whole piece (-3)!
809,27,22,1Kh8,b'2r2r1k/pppR2pp/4R3/3N1n2/3N4/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 w - -',Disabling that possible knight check.

811,27,24,2Ree7,b'2r4k/pppRR1pp/8/3N1r2/8/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 b - -',... the mighty seventh rank can be fully possessed by two rooks. I claim that even without the won piece (and pawn) the game is dead lost for Black in such a position.
812,27,25,2c6,b'2r4k/pp1RR1pp/2p5/3N1r2/8/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 w - -',Attacks my knight.
813,27,26,2Rexg7,b'2r4k/pp1R2Rp/2p5/3N1r2/8/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 b - -',I ignore the threat and just eat through the yummy pawns in the seventh rank.
814,27,27,2Rxd5,b'2r4k/pp1R2Rp/2p5/3r4/8/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 w - -',22... cxd5 would have been way better opening the c-file allowing some counter-play and threatening Rxf2 and attacking on c2.
815,27,28,2Rdxb7,b'2r4k/pR4Rp/2p5/3r4/8/1P6/PKP2PPP/8 b - -',Another pawn in the seventh rank restaurant.

818,27,31,2f4,b'r2r1k2/6RR/2p5/8/5P2/1P6/PKP3PP/8 b - f3',Now one of Whites pawns is needed to give the death blow.
819,27,32,2f5,b'r2r1k2/6RR/8/2p2P2/8/1P6/PKP3PP/8 b - -',Closer...
820,27,33,2f6,b'1r1r1k2/6RR/5P2/2p5/8/1P6/PKP3PP/8 b - -',Alright the seventh rank is supported now properly for also occupying the eighth.
821,27,34,3Rh8#,b'1r1rk2R/6R1/5P2/2p5/8/1P6/PKP3PP/8 b - -',And that's it. I hope this game was in some way instructive for you -- I admit that it isn't too much strategic thinking behind this game and the win did not have to do that much with the opening but still it shows the power of the seventh rank and it points out which kind of positions arise from the Reti gambit and that it is just fun to play ;-)

830,29,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So he plays the English against the England captain!
831,29,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I give him the chance to go back to more common lines with 2.d4 but he keeps it to an English.

835,29,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So I partly block his Bg2

Now if I exchange on b5 I can't move my Nc6 without losing a pawn on c7 to his rook on c1. So I have to move my knight immediately. I have only one move otherwise he can play Bg2xb7

899,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game between brewinski and flemming was played during the Toccata team mini-tournament. After a fairly passive opening the middle game turns to chaos. The game has incredible swings of fortune. White a Queen down manages to draw the game but as we shall see in the end game analysed by Yttrio and l-d-j there are missed chances for Black and White to play for a win. Many thanks to Yttrio l-d-j and liam1260 for their comments corrections and analysis.

It leaves b7 undefended and as we shall see this proves to be a mistake: 3.d4 Bg4 4.dxe5 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 and now White starts an attack on f6. 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 - a double attack on f7 and b7. Black must defend f6 but in doing so loses b7. 7...Qe7 8.Qxb7. Thanks to liam1260 for his corrections on my notation here.
902,30,3,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. c3 is a rather passive way to prepare for d4 and prevents Nc3 defending e4. c3 is a good way to prepare for d4 in the Giuoco Piano and the Ruy Lopez. The difference is that the light square Bishop is already developed which allows castling and Re1 defending e4 and allowing c3 to be played shortly after. With this in mind 4.Bb5 pins the Knight and prepares for d4 while keeping Nc3 ready to defend e4 when Black plays Nf6. 
903,30,4,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now White's plan of d4 is thwarted his light squared Bishop is locked in and does not become active until move 24. 5.Qc2 may have been preferable.

It may have been preferable to keep developing pieces with 5...Be7 preparing to castle and also defending against a possible Bg5.

Black can move his Bishop to e6 with plenty of pressure on d5 however that may be dangerous - after White plays d4 d5 becomes a real threat of forking Black's Knight and Bishop. Simply castling keeping his Bishop undeveloped and playing d5 first may be best.

In doing so he temporarily locks in his Knight on b1 but he can play c4 dislodging the Knight on d5 and allowing Nc3 - a good idea? L-D-J points out that the c4 Nc3 idea is no good because it leaves the weak backward d3 pawn on the half-open d file. Alternatively leaving the Bishop on e3 with Black taking it would give White a central e pawn and open the f file for his Rook - good compensation for losing the Bishop pair.

Ng7+ Black must play 34... Qxg7 (if 34... Kd8 then 35. Rbd7#). After 35. Rxg7 Black doesn't have time to take the Bishop with 35... Rxc4 due to 36. Rg8# leaving White up a Bishop.

Yttrio provides a different analysis: after any of the three times White plays Rg7+ (moves 32 34 and 36) Black can play Qxg7 and after White recaptures with the Rook White has two minor pieces for a Rook and pawn which would lead to an interesting game that probably favors White. 

Yttrio summarises the game: Black had a couple of good chances to consolidate his lead and win the game then White missed his own chances for a winning position. From personal experience playing over the board sometimes draws like this feel like a minor victory for both players.

931,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello. Here is an interesting and enjoyable game that I recently played. I am playing with the black pieces and again I respond to 1.e4 with my favourite defence: The Sicilian. I manage to gain an advantage of 1 pawn in the middle game which eventually converted to a win after a hard-fought endgame. Here is a link to the Gameknot anaylsis if you are interested: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17509783&fb=1&rnd=0.2053531357087195.
932,32,1,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black exchanges the pawn trading his c pawn for whites d pawn. Black hopes for a strong centre later in the game.
933,32,2,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',In this position neither player wants to take the knight as doing so would benefit the opponent regardless of which player initiates the exchange.
934,32,3,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',All book moves so far. Black attacks the undefended e pawn.
935,32,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',And white obliges to defend it whilst developing a minor piece.
936,32,5,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I used to play 5...e5 in this position but I feel that this move allows more flexibility in the centre. e5 leads to a closed centre and potential weaknesses on the Queenside dark squares which white may be able to exploit later in the game. With this move I make room for my LSB and wait to see what my opponent plays before deciding how to contest the centre of the board.
937,32,6,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Pins my knight and threatens to win a pawn.

943,32,12,bxc6,b'r2qk2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/1B4B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I retake with tempo. I didn't want to swap pieces at this point and I was not worried about having an isolated pawn on the a file.
944,32,13,Rb8,b'1r1qk2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k -',My Queens Rook takes control of the half-open b file.

946,32,15,1Qa5,b'1r2k2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q5B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w k -',Attacking the bishop on g5 and trying to complicate the position. Moving the Queen tends to alter the position significantly making mistakes more likely.
947,32,16,1Bd2,b'1r2k2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q7/4P3/2N5/PPPBBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b k -',Enables a discovered attack on the black Queen but blocks whites Queen for a few moves.

However in hindsight this move is probably better as it also prevents my knight from landing on g4. Now I must move my LSB before I can move my Knight on f6 releasing the power of the DSB. Black is significantly more cramped than white but it's not a problem yet. Gameknot gives white a very slight at this stage.

952,32,21,1Qa5,b'1r3rk1/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q7/4P3/2N1BP2/PPP1B1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',I also considered playing c5 to close off the diagonal but it would have restricted my Queen too much I decided this was a better way to proceed.
953,32,22,1Qd2,b'1r3rk1/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q7/4P3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/1R3RK1 b - -',I thought white was looking to play Rfd8 but it seemed he had other intentions.
954,32,23,1Be6,b'1r3rk1/p3ppbp/2ppbnp1/q7/4P3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Creating space to play Nd7 and threatening the pawn on a2.
955,32,24,Rb7,b'5rk1/pr2ppbp/2ppbnp1/q7/4P3/P1N1BP2/1PPQB1PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Defends my a pawn and creates the possibility to double my rooks on the important b file.
956,32,25,1b4,b'5rk1/pr2ppbp/2ppbnp1/q7/1P2P3/P1N1BP2/2PQB1PP/1R3RK1 b - b3',Qxa3 looks like a trap. At the time I didn't fully understand why but I didn't want to risk it. I assumed the my opponent would not leave a pawn hanging without adequate compensation so I played it safe...
957,32,26,Rfb8,b'1r4k1/prq1ppbp/2ppbnp1/8/1P2P3/P1N1BP2/2PQB1PP/1R3R1K w - -',Rfb8? This move is a mistake which allows white to win the exchange with 19. Ba6! Rb6 20. Bxb6 axb6. Which may well have been a decisive advantage in this game. Luckily for me my opponent also missed this.
958,32,27,1Bh6,b'1r4k1/prq1ppbp/2ppbnpB/8/1P2P3/P1N2P2/2PQB1PP/1R3R1K b - -',?!

960,32,29,2bxa5,b'1r4k1/1rq1pp1p/2ppbnpQ/P7/4P3/P1N2P2/2P1B1PP/1R3R1K b - -',Gameknot flags bxa5 as an inaccuracy suggesting that Qd2 was a better move. bxa5 allows my Queen to quickly become more active.

962,32,31,Ra7,b'6k1/r3pp1p/2pp1np1/q7/4P3/P4P2/b1PQB1PP/1N3R1K w - -',Rb2 was perhaps a better move here.

964,32,33,Rxa3,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp1np1/8/4P3/r1N2P2/b1P1B1PP/5R1K w - -',Finally I win the pawn and protect the bishop.
965,32,34,2Nxa2,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp1np1/8/4P3/r4P2/N1P1B1PP/5R1K b - -',Another set of minor pieces is exchanged and we start to enter the endgame. In this kind of position I felt that a bishop really has no advantage over a knight. I was happy with the exchange.
966,32,35,2Rxa2,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp1np1/8/4P3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/5R1K w - -',Also the rook gains a good position on the 7th rank which seriously locks down whites position. The rook stays here for 13 moves! As well as attacking and pinning the c pawn it later prevents whites King from getting to the centre which is highly significant.
967,32,36,2Bd3,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp1np1/8/4P3/3B1P2/r1P3PP/5R1K b - -',The bishop tries to disguise himself as a pawn.
968,32,37,2Nd7,b'6k1/3npp1p/2pp2p1/8/4P3/3B1P2/r1P3PP/5R1K w - -',The knight had no good squares to move to on f6. Now it can move towards the centre attacking the bishop and also the f pawn is now mobile.
969,32,38,2Rc1,b'6k1/3npp1p/2pp2p1/8/4P3/3B1P2/r1P3PP/2R4K b - -',Anticipating Ne5 or Nc5; Rc1 enables the bishop to move but the rook is the most powerful piece in the game now and all he is doing is defending a lonely pawn on the second rank. Black has a good advantage here. Around this time my opponent said to me that he would be happy with a draw. Whilst I was certainly playing to win I was well aware that it would only take a small mistake for me to lose the advantage.
970,32,39,2Ne5,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp2p1/4n3/4P3/3B1P2/r1P3PP/2R4K w - -',Threatening to exchange the N for B. perhaps Nc5 was a better move here.
971,32,40,3Be2,b'6k1/4pp1p/2pp2p1/4n3/4P3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/2R4K b - -',Prevents the exchange but the c pawn is again pinned. Blacks position is much more active.
972,32,41,3e6,b'6k1/5p1p/2ppp1p1/4n3/4P3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/2R4K w - -',Preparing f5. I did not want to leave the h pawn isolated.
973,32,42,f5,b'6k1/7p/2ppp1p1/4np2/4P3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/2R3K1 w - f6',Gameknot says my advantage goes from +1.55 to +0.80 with this move; but I do not understand why. The bad thing about the Gameknot analysis is that you have to make quite a serious inaccuracy for it to be flagged.
974,32,43,3Kf1,b'6k1/7p/2ppp1p1/4np2/4P3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/2R2K2 b - -',Gameknot prefers f4 followed by exf5 and white's position suddenly looks much better. (See analysis)
975,32,44,3fxe4,b'6k1/7p/2ppp1p1/4n3/4p3/5P2/r1P1B1PP/2R2K2 w - -',Pawn exchange.
976,32,45,3fxe4,b'6k1/7p/2ppp1p1/4n3/4P3/8/r1P1B1PP/2R2K2 b - -',Now white has 2 isolated pawns.
977,32,46,3Kf7,b'8/5k1p/2ppp1p1/4n3/4P3/8/r1P1B1PP/2R2K2 w - -',It's time for my King to get into the action!
978,32,47,3c4,b'8/5k1p/2ppp1p1/4n3/2P1P3/8/r3B1PP/2R2K2 b - c3',I think white should have followed suit with Kf2.
979,32,48,Nf7,b'8/5n1p/2pppkp1/8/2P1P3/8/r3B1PP/3R1K2 w - -',Defends d6 and makes space for my King to cause problems for white in the centre.
980,32,49,3Bd3,b'8/5n1p/2ppp1p1/4k3/2P1P3/3B3P/r5P1/3R1K2 b - -',Defends e4.

985,32,54,4Be2,b'8/5n2/2ppp1p1/4k2p/2P1P2P/8/2r1B1P1/3R1K2 b - -',White's bishop is tied down to defence and it seems both players do not have a good idea about how to proceed.
986,32,55,4Nh6,b'8/8/2ppp1pn/4k2p/2P1P2P/8/2r1B1P1/3R1K2 w - -',But I thought I must get my Knight into the centre.
987,32,56,4Be2,b'8/8/2ppp1pn/4k2p/2P1P2P/8/r3B1P1/3R1K2 b - -',White seems to be totally locked down. If he wants to protect both pawns his rook must be on the d file. Anything else and white will lose a pawn probably giving black a decisive advantage.
988,32,57,4Bxg4,b'8/8/2ppp1p1/4k2p/2P1P1BP/8/r5P1/3R1K2 b - -',Bxg4?1 Although not flagged as a mistake by GK after exchanging the minor pieces it is difficult to see how white can prevent his material deficit from growing. I suppose white was hoping for counter play on the h-file.
989,32,58,4Rb4,b'8/8/2ppp1p1/4k3/1RP1P1pP/8/2r3P1/5K2 b - -',An immediate Rb8 was probably better.
990,32,59,4c5,b'8/8/3pp1p1/2p1k3/1RP1P1pP/8/2r3P1/5K2 w - -',Now the c pawn is defended.

992,32,61,Rf6,b'6R1/8/3pprp1/2p1k3/2P1P2P/6p1/6P1/4K3 w - -',I preferred to defend my g-pawn. I didn't want to calculate the possibilities of whites h pawn becoming passed.
993,32,62,Rf4,b'8/8/3pp3/2p1k3/2P1PrRp/8/6P1/4K3 w - -',The final mistake by white which leads him to resign as black will end up taking both the e and c pawns for free! I would like to thank my opponent Michael putting up a great fight and allowing such an enjoyable and interesting game. Comments and ratings are very welcome. Ciao for now!
994,32,63,5Rxf4,b'8/8/3pp3/2p1k3/2P1PR1p/8/6P1/4K3 b - -',
995,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I start the game with e4 which partially occupies the center and allows a few of my pieces to come out..
996,33,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My opponent replies with the Nimzovich Defence which is seldom seen compared to the king's pawn game the sicilian or the french defence.
997,33,2,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Main line so far.
998,33,3,Rb8,b'1rbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQk -',!? Black throws the opening book out of the window with this move. He either prepares a future b7-b5 push or places his rook on a open file in case I would play Bb5 followed by Bxc6 later I guess. It is not a bad move by any means. More commonly played is 3...Bf5.
999,33,4,h5,b'1rbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/2n5/3pP2p/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQk h6',Black tries to expand to the kingside I guess.
1000,33,5,Bg5,b'1rbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/2n5/3pP1Bp/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQk -',However Black's last move he can't play pawn to h6 anymore so I place my bishop there to pressurize the kingside.
1001,33,6,f6,b'1rbqkbnr/ppp1p1p1/2n2p2/3pP1Bp/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQk -',Black tries to chase my bishop away...

1006,33,11,1c3,b'1rbq1b1r/ppp1p1p1/2nkP1Qn/3p2Np/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',!! The position is very critical. Take a look at the position. Which black pieces can move? Which one can't? The kingside has been completely shut down; The h6 knight can't move or else I play 11.Nf7# the f8 bishop is stuck behind two black which are themselves blocked by my pieces The h8 rook CAN move! To g8 and h8 back and forth accomplishing absolutely nothing. What about the queenside? The black queen can't move without being captured next turn the c8 bishop can't go anywhere (10...Bxe6?? 11.Qxe6#) the b8 rook isn't doing much (but is better than his kingside counterpart) and the king is stuck on d6. The only available moves that help are moving the a pawn the b pawn or the knight. I didn't want the knight to capture on d4 thus it is why I played 10.c3. The main question here is: Can Black get out of trouble safely? What do you think reader?
1007,33,12,1b5,b'1rbq1b1r/p1p1p1p1/2nkP1Qn/1p1p2Np/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ b6',Black reasonably tries to open the queenside to open up some space for his pieces. Gameknot's analysis engine thinks the position is equal.
1008,33,13,1f4,b'1rbq1b1r/p1p1p1p1/2nkP1Qn/1p1p2Np/3P1P2/2P5/PP4PP/RN2KB1R b KQ f3',? The main idea behind this move was to get to f5 to further support my e6 pawn but it doesn't quite work. Better here according to the engine was 11.Nd2 leading to 11...Na5 12. Ndf3 Kc6 13. Ne5+ Kb6 14. Ngf7 Nxf7 15. Nxf7 Qe8 16. Nxh8 Qxg6 17. Nxg6 Bxe6 18.

Material is equal I have two knight against Black's bishops there are many holes in Black's camp and both players has to get their remaining pieces out. I think I have a slight advantage here.

Black cannot advance on the kingside without losing material. However my knights can jump into Black's territory via e5 or g5.

A very interesting variation happens if White plays a waiting move such as 40.Kg2! Black cannot avoid to lose a piece. Sample lines: 40.Kg2! Bg7 (40...g5 41.hxg5 fork)(40...Re7anywhere 41.Rxe8+)(40...Rf5 41.Nxg6+ fork)(40...Kg7 41.Rxe8 Rxe8 42.Rxe8) 41.Ng5 and there are too many threats to deal with. The move I played 40.Nd7+ also wins. Black can't take the knight: 40...Rxd7 41.Rxe8+ Kg7 (41...Kf7 42.Ne5+ Kg7 43.Rg8+ Kh7 44.Rh8+ Kg7 45.Rag8#) 42.Rg8+ Kf7 (42...Kh7 43.Rh8+ Kg7 44.Rag8+ Kf7 45.Ne5+ Ke7 46.Rh7+! with mate to follow) 43.Ne5+ Ke7 44.Rge8+ Kd6 45.Ra6+ with mate to follow.

1043,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I decided to take part in Concordborn's MT because I would be playing against players within 200 rating points of my own rating.  In this game I was matched up against a Class B player.  This is a themed MT which explores a certain branch of the Sicilian Defense.  I get into a good position in the middlegame only to be floored by a double exchange sacrifice.  Henry is then subjected to a Deadly Dash from the Wicked Witch of the West and is driven to the h column where he does manage to stay out of Old Matey's shadow.  Unfortunately Henry could not dodge Ye Olde Perpetualle and I had to concede a Low Draw.  How did this happen?  Where here is the Gameknot Analysis.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17374759&rnd=0.411434717519163"
1044,34,1,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',6.  Ndb5 - this is where the forced moves end and the MT starts.  A knight comes to b5 and would like to plant itself on d6 should black's dsb move off the f8-a3 diagonal.  The knight also puts pressure on c7 threatening a standard K and R fork.
1045,34,2,Na3,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',8. Na3 - this knight is forced back but there is the possiblity of it relocating to c4 later on.
1046,34,3,gxf6,b'r1bqk2r/4bp1p/p1np1p2/1p2p3/2N1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',10. .... gxf6 - the white knight does go to c4 where it is targeted by the b5 pawn.  Rather than move the knight away immediately a B for N trade appears on the kingside.  This is in the World DB - I still cannot resist exchanging a B for N to break up an opponent's pawn structure!
1047,34,4,1Nf5,b'r2qk2r/1b2bp1p/p1np1p2/1p2pN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',12. Nf5 - a good outpost for my king knight.

1050,34,7,1Be2,b'2r1k2r/n3bp1p/pq1p1p2/1p1QpN2/4P3/2P5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQk -',16. Be2 - I decided to develop Fou Leblanc to pave the way for castling.  However Henry is destined to stay in the centre of the board.  Bit dangerous when the queens are on the board.
1051,34,8,1Qb3,b'4k2r/n3bp1p/pq1p1p2/1pr1pN2/4P3/1QP5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQk -',17. Qb3 - Glenda stays on the a2-f7 diagonal.

1053,34,10,2h4,b'4k3/n3bp1p/pq1p1p2/1pr1pNr1/P3P1PP/1QP2P2/1P2B3/R3K2R b KQ h3',21. h4 - I try to drive back the black KR but my opponent has other ideas .....

1057,34,14,2Bc4,b'4kb2/n4p1p/1q1p1p2/p1r1pP2/PpB1P2P/1QP2P2/1P6/R3K2R b KQ -',25. Bc4?? - this move condemns me to a Low Draw.  Gameknot Analysis recommended cxb4.  My opponent then threatens after a rook retreat to defend f7 a nasty check on e3 from the Wicked Witch of the West.
1058,34,15,2Ke2,b'4kb2/n1r2p1p/1q1p1p2/p3pP2/PpB1P2P/1QP2P2/1P2K3/R6R b - -',26. Ke2 - Henry tries to prevent this and it also connects the rooks but now black moves his bishoph to h6 and renews the deadly threat of Qe3+.
1059,34,16,2cxb4,b'4k3/n1r2p1p/1q1p1p1b/p3pP2/PPB1P2P/1Q3P2/1P2K3/R6R b - -',27. cxb4 - at last I play this move recommended two moves back.  It does open up a protective line from Glenda to e3 but Glenda is overloaded and black exploits this with a second exchange sacrifice.  I accept and the Witch moves in Henry must now experience another deadly dash - thank god his seafood diet has kept him nimble despite his dotage!
1060,34,17,Qxf3+,b'4k3/n4p1p/3p1p1b/p3pP2/PPQ1P2P/5q2/1P6/R4K1R w - -',29. ..... Qxf3+ - black gets a pawn back with check.  Henry must move to g1 because if Ke1?? then both rooks drop.
1061,34,18,Be3+,b'4k3/n4p1p/3p1p2/p3pP2/PPQ1P2P/4bq2/1P6/R5KR w - -',30. .... Be3+ - in comes black's dsb to join in the attack?  Can Henry survive?  If he does then I do have a 4 point material advantage to play with which could be decisive.

Qf3+ - after the hypnotic last few moves I break the trance by declaring the game drawn on the grounds of Threefold Repetition because my opponent set up conditional moves.  Even though I am still four material points to the good and am more than 100 points north of my opponent's rating there is nothing better than to settle for the perpetual.  My opponent extracts a 3.8 rating point tariff off me taking me below 1850.  Thankfully a dour high draw against a Class B 1900+ player cancelled out the lost points here.  There will soon be another annotation posted.  In that game Henry will get the fright of his life again from the Wicked Witch of the West this time against a Class D player.  Thankfully that game will end in victory for Yours Truly but not without some heavy weather.  Anyhow hope you have a good read and are enjoying this beautiful English spring weather!  Bye for now - Joanne
1064,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I really like the sicilian Defence and so started out with the book move e2 to e4 but my opponent had different plans. 
1065,35,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My opponent decides to go for the french defence

The other choice is to move his queen once again and protect the bishop. You see how both moves require him to continue to remove pieces and not being able to continue to develop while I can begin my attack.

My opponent asked me for a rated challenge.  I did oblige because I have been in a whirlwind of rated games although I will still play most non-MT games unrated.  Thankfully I won this game but it was very slow and hard process even when I was a pawn up in a K & P ending I found it hard to find the right winning plan.  Thankfully I did.

1104,36,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bb5 - this double king pawn opening becomes the Ruy Lopez with this move and I play the most usual move which is a6.

1107,36,4,b5,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq b6',6. .... b5 - now the lsb is driven back.

I have managed to free my position quite a lot and the d5 pawn is virtually isolated thanks to my b5 pawn.  I take advantage of this and get a decisive pawn plus over the next few moves.
1113,36,10,Bxd5,b'r5k1/2p2ppp/p2p1b2/1p1b4/8/6P1/PPP2P1P/RNB2K2 w - -',18. .... Bxd5 - now here we go.  We are almost in an endgame.  White's queenside is still undeveloped and I have the bishop pair plus a 1 pawn advantage.  Now I must capitalise on this and convert this to victory.  Unfortunately the path to victory is not as easy as it looks and white has no intention of waving that white flag ..... yet ....

Bc6 - the retreats of the ecclesiastical twins over the last two moves may seem baffling to you but please note that I do have a pawn majority of 4:3 on the queenside.  These prelates are there to provide spiritual guidance to this particular flock of footmen.  I intend to create a passer out of one of them by eventually pushing up the d6 pawn at a convenient moment and if I do this then the c5 pawn is still defended by Fou Lenoir.
1118,36,15,Bf6,b'4r1k1/5ppp/p1bp1b2/1pp5/7P/1PP1B1P1/P2N1P2/R4K2 w - -',23. .... Bf6 - Fou Lenoir slips back to f6 however to use white's backward c3 pawn as a tie down for the white QR.  Even if this tie-down is only temporary this could gain me some very useful tempi later on.
1119,36,16,b4,b'4r1k1/5ppp/2bp1b2/p1p5/1pP4P/1P2B1P1/P2N1P2/2R2K2 w - -',25. .... b4 - hmmp no immediate chance of getting a passer here but I must persist.

If white puts his own rook on the e column to neutralise its power I will be more than happy to trade it off which should accentuate my 1 pawn advantage.

1122,36,19,3Kxe1,b'6k1/5ppp/2bp4/p1p5/1pP2P1P/1P4P1/P2N4/4K3 b - -',30. Kxe1 - the rook trade has now taken place.  But where do I go from here?  Well here is the maxim.  Activate your king in the endgame.  I know for sure that my king Henry gets really ravenous in the endgame.  He just lurves those p(r)awns and he will feast on them if he gets the chance!
1123,36,20,Ke7,b'8/4kppp/2bp4/p1p5/1pP2P1P/1P4P1/P2N1K2/8 w - -',31. ..... Ke7 - sure enough out comes Henry!

1125,36,22,3Nf3,b'8/4k1pp/2bp4/p1p2p2/1pP2P1P/1P2KNP1/P7/8 b - -',33. Nf3 - if there is one sure way to lose when you are behind on material it is this way.  Do not trade down to a pure K & P ending except in this circumstance.  Your opponent has a backward pawn and your own king is near it.  This game does illustrate that particular principle http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-exception-to-the-rule?gm=24210 - but it does not hold up in this game!
1126,36,23,d5,b'8/6pp/4k3/p1pp1p1P/1pP2P2/1P3KP1/P7/8 w - -',35. ..... d5 - Over the last two moves Henry and my d pawn have formed a dynamic duo to correct the backward pawn scenario.  My pawn finally gets to d5 and if it is traded off then Henry is beautifully centralised for the endgame.
1127,36,24,d4+,b'8/6pp/4k3/p1p2p1P/1pPp1P2/1P2K1P1/P7/8 w - -',36. ..... d4+ - I now get my passer on the queenside.  This passer is just three squares from Glendadom but he cannot get there yet.  I must do something else first.
1128,36,25,Kf6,b'8/6pp/5k2/p1p2p1P/1pPp1P2/1P3KP1/P7/8 w - -',37. ..... Kf6 - the start of a Cat Among The Pigeons (or Henry among the white kingside pawns) plan.  The white king dare not stray too far on the kingside for fear of Glenda appearing on d1.
1129,36,26,g5,b'8/7p/5k2/p1p2ppP/1pPp1P2/1P4P1/P4K2/8 w - g6',38. .... g5 - carrying out that plan a little further.  If PxP then K x P and the pawn on h5 falls next move.
1130,36,27,g4+,b'8/7p/5k2/p1p2p1P/1pPp1Pp1/1P3KP1/P7/8 w - -',39. ..... g4+ - this pawn advance cuts off any defense of the pawn on h5.  Henry is licking his lips!
1131,36,28,Kg7,b'8/6kp/8/p1p2p1P/1pPp1Pp1/1P4P1/P4K2/8 w - -',"40. .... Kg7.  Henry moves towards the pawn.  My opponent and I have a little chat about the game.  He asked me if I had a winning plan and if I did he would resign.  He did ask me if I allowed resignations and I said that it was up to him - if he wanted to play it out to mate - fine.  If he wanted to resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material it was also fine by me.  I then spelled out my winning plan as follows:- You will not be able to prevent Henry from eating your h pawn. Here is the plan. 1. Eat the h pawn. 2. Push up my h pawn and temporarily sac it and decoy your g pawn onto the h column which will be a target for Henry. Your king may be able to defend it but I will then push my d pawn. Your king cannot be in two places at once. In order to stop the d pawn getting to Glendadom you will have to abandon your h pawn and then Henry will help the g pawn crown. I will now play the first move in my plan. The next move will be Kh6 followed by Kxh5. Joanne

After that he waved the white flag.  I will be annotating more games soon as they have some interesting features in them.  Until then - bye for now - Joanne  "

1139,37,7,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq e3',So I continue with the logical move.
1140,37,8,fxe4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/8/3Pp3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',He correctly takes rather allow me to eventually get in e4-e5 see Charles Higgie (BCF158) vs. TimHilton (BCF141) where I gained a massive opening advantage but eventually lost.
1141,37,9,Nxe4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/8/3PN3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',So I take back.

1144,37,12,d5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3p4/3PB3/6P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQK1NR w KQkq d6',This scores badly on the databases and I am not surprised - it leaves black with a backward e pawn on the semi-open e file (in other words given time I can pile up my rooks against it. While in some openings black can live with a backward pawn in a semi-open file (for instance e7-e5 systems in the open Sicilian) it is dubious here.
1145,37,13,Bg2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3p4/3P4/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',So I drop back.

1147,37,15,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Now this is where we leave the opening databases. In both the games where this position can up white has played Ne2. But my move seems to me more logical - preventing e7-e5 and leaving the e file open for my rooks. What do you think dear reader?

1183,37,51,2Bxa2,b'r7/pp1n2kp/6p1/4R3/8/2P3PP/B4P2/5RK1 b - -',I get the queen back
1184,37,52,2Nxe5,b'r7/pp4kp/6p1/4n3/8/2P3PP/B4P2/5RK1 w - -',And so we reach a position with level material again.

1190,37,58,3Nc6,b'1r6/pp5p/2n2kp1/3B4/5P2/2P3PP/8/4R1K1 w - -',He retreats the knight. He said afterwards that he moved this very quickly - it was the last move before the time control. He thought that Nd3 was stronger. I am not convinced though
1191,37,59,3Re6+,b'1r6/pp5p/2n1Rkp1/3B4/5P2/2P3PP/8/6K1 b - -',I throw in a check. Now I think he should give up a pawn here with Kg7. After I play Nxc6 followed by Rxc6 or Re7 followed by Rxa7 he has Rb2 and I would have thought he may well be able to draw a pawn down. But he played...
1192,37,60,3Kf5,b'1r6/pp5p/2n1R1p1/3B1k2/5P2/2P3PP/8/6K1 w - -',I think he is losing now

1194,37,62,3Rd8,b'3r4/pp5p/2n1R1p1/3B1k2/5P2/2P3PP/5K2/8 w - -',He hits my bishop
1195,37,63,3Bc4,b'3r4/pp5p/2n1R1p1/5k2/2B2P2/2P3PP/5K2/8 b - -',I retreat. Of course he can't hit it again with Na5? which loses to Re5+ winning the knight.
1196,37,64,3g5,b'3r4/pp5p/2n1R3/5kp1/2B2P2/2P3PP/5K2/8 w - -',So he tries to prevent the mate

1199,37,67,3gxf4,b'3r4/pp5p/2n1R3/5k2/2B2P2/2P2K1P/8/8 b - -',I take back. OK find the best move for him?
1200,37,68,3a5,b'3r4/1p5p/2n1R3/p4k2/2B2P2/2P2K1P/8/8 w - a6',This certainly isn't it! I think he has to play 35....Rd3+ 36. Bxd3 Kxe6 37. Bxh2 and he may still have drawing chances a pawn down.
1201,37,69,3Rh6,b'3r4/1p5p/2n4R/p4k2/2B2P2/2P2K1P/8/8 b - -',Threat Be6 mate. He now picked up his rook realised that he was in serious trouble and eventually moved it. The only way to fight on is Ne5+ but he is surely lost a piece down.
1202,37,70,3Re8,b'4r3/1p5p/2n4R/p4k2/2B2P2/2P2K1P/8/8 w - -',So he prevents the mate in one. Find my move now!

1206,38,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The computer analysis prefers 4. d4.  I wanted to avoid an early fight over d4.  A line like 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 is probably fine for White who maintains two centrally-developed pieces to Black's none.  In general I would venture that when your opponent wastes a tempo you should be more willing than usual to seek out an open game to exploit the waste of time.
1207,38,3,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White's dsb is the only undeveloped piece and has nowhere particularly helpful to go  a problem that could have been avoided by 4. d4.

Neither player looks to have a particularly well-placed dsb although Black's might be easier to free as it is his own men causing the problem whereas White's is constrained by the Black pawns.  An alternative development plan for White could have involved Nbd2 b3 and Bb2 preparing d4 and a slightly better coordinated position in exchange for an uncastled king (although it's unpressured)

Bh5 looks like a good option to maintain the pin and the tension since White can't really follow it with g4 without a horrible weakening of the kingside pawn cover and will struggle to protect the knight with something other than the g-pawn. 
1210,38,6,Na5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p1n1p/n3p3/2B1P3/2NPBQ1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w kq -',Having just given up the bishop pair Black immediately moves to deprive White of the same.

Bxf7 is a tempting but probably unsound sacrificial attack that leaves the Black king in the centre (this would be even more tempting in the more open game starting from 4. d4 discussed earlier).  Bd5 looks best continuing Nxd4 11. Nxd5 and if Black plays 11. ... c6 to push the knight back 12. Nc3 is fine and Black must spot the threat of b4 on his knight or lose it although if he does spot it 12. ... b5 looks reasonably good for Black.  10. b4 just doesn't do very much.  If White is resigned to losing the bishop on its current square b3 might be better allowing White to recapture with the b-pawn and keep the d-pawn for opening up the central files. 
1212,38,8,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/3p1n1p/4p3/1PP1P3/2N1BQ1P/P1P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',This position looks quite flat and placcid.  White has the half-open d-file to work with but his queenside pawns look messy and his knight on that side of the board looks weak.  Black has very limited activity but compensates with a lack of defensive weakenesses. 
1213,38,9,1Qg3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/3p1n1p/4p3/1PP1P3/2N1B1QP/P1P2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Attempts to start an attack on the king and threatens Bxh6.  Also allows the queen to line up on the e5 pawn which can be undermined by White playing c5 opening up the centre for White's queen to dominate.

1216,38,12,1Qd7,b'r4r1k/pppqbpp1/3p1n1p/4p3/1PP1P3/2N1BPQP/P1P3P1/R4RK1 w - -',Allows the queen to start moving into the fight.  I also like 13. ... c5 to open up a dark-square diagonal to allow the queen to attack the White queenside pawns.

Allows White to play Qg4 which attacks both the Black queen and knight and allows an eventual material edge for White who finishes the sequence (15. Qg4 Qxg4 16. fxg4 Ng3 17. Nxe7 Nxf1 18. Rxf1) with a small advantage.

He can do this by encouraging action on both wings or just the queenside if he can act quickly.
1221,38,17,1a4,b'r4r1k/p3qpp1/1ppp3p/4p2n/PPP1P3/2P1BP1P/5QP1/R4RK1 b - a3',These queenside pawn advances are also a way for White's bishop which can reach them to have power over the knight who is stuck on the other side of the world.

1223,38,19,2Rc2,b'r1r4k/p3qpp1/1p1p3p/2p1p2n/PPP1P3/2P1BP1P/2R2QP1/5RK1 b - -',White plays this because without it he fears 20. ... cxb4 21. cxb4 Rxb4 allowing Black to establish a rook in his territory and dropping a pawn.  Instead the more active counter 20. a5 allows White to really use the bishop's power to threaten with an advanced pawn.

I think White fears Black playing Qxc4 and cxb4 with the c-pawn pinned but Rff2 doesn't really help that since Black can trade his queen for two rooks and give White a difficult time.  Or he can just win the b-pawn after 23. ... Qxc4 24. Qxf4 cxb4 25. cxb4 Qxb4.  23. Rfc1 was a better move with the dangerous doubling that actually prevents the above pawn-winning line or the immedite Qxf4.

White therefore chooses to simplify and solidify the draw. 
1238,38,34,Ke5,b'8/8/1p4pp/pP2k3/P5P1/4K2P/8/8 w - -',There's no way for either side to make progress.  White would have had some winning chances after other king moves but as it is both sides are locked down and so a draw results.

The gameknot database for the Scotch shows only d6 as the book move here.  In 365chess.com they show White winning ~79% of the time with the response of e5.  Black cannot find a good place for his Knight.

Note how this one imprecise move by Black causes it to lose time while White develops nicely.

This corresponds to the advice I give to look for a mistake or lack of precision or sharpness in the opening seize on it and relentlessly put pressure on your opponent. The opening book does show Black's Bf6 as possible.
