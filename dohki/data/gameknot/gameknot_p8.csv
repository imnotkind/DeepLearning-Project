46,4,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',"I have been studying the King's Gambit a lot since late May and have found it to be an extremely interesting opening.  With enough studying under my belt, I decided it was time to venture forth from theory to practice.  (This has been the only opening I have studied heavily thus far, and I'm still not a pro at it by any means.)  I have already had some very interesting games on-line and OTB.  One thing I have noticed is that unlike other openings, the King's Gambit has a tendency to lead white to quick victory in the mid-game (as in this game) or disastrous defeat in the end due to piece sacrifices.  I wasn't originally planning on annotating these games and making this a pseudo-series, but then I realized the Gameknot community might have a lot to share/learn with/from me with regards to my moves (and perhaps enjoy mocking me).  (Like ""you idiot, why didn't you see this move, you could have totally had him"" or ""you orangutan, go read 'crying like a Grandmaster' by GM Ben Finegold."")  I will also be including in this pseudo-series annotations of Grandmaster level games.  Without much further ado, I give you my first very successful game that celebrates the King's Gambit ferocity.  I hope you enjoy it and comments/feedback on moves made are greatly appreciated!"
47,4,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"It's the Petrov Defense in the King's Gambit Declined line.  This is an interesting way to decline the King's Gambit because rather than taking the offered pawn and free threat of check on Qh4, black has elected to threaten the e4 pawn in an attempt to arrest white's center control.  Not to say this opening is a mistake, but I think this response gives white some time back because now the black queen cannot threaten check for at least a turn.  White's best moves here, in my opinion, are fxe5, Bc4, d3, Nc3 or Nf3.  In the King's Gambit, it is often important to develop the King side and castle rapidly.  Bobby Fischer loved the move Bc4, even in the accepted line- the so called Bishop's Gambit.  Nf6 by black gives white the opportunity to do this a bit earlier.  Although I think it's a good move, I personally don't like d3 in the King's Gambit unless I'm ready to spend a move on d4 in the future because d3 makes developing the light square bishop harder and honestly cramps the King's Gambit style.  There are also games where the King's gambit transposes into less aggressive games about position and center control and other theory that I still don't have a firm grasp on yet.  (I'm still studying lines around d4.  That might be a good move here, too.)  Nf3 is a bit too passive at this moment in the Petrov Defense, but it isn't terrible.  Nc3 is also passive but is better here because it protects the e4 pawn, develops the queen side knight and opens the a1 rook for later use; if you play the King's Gambit right, I can almost guarantee every piece from c1 to h1 will be developed quickly.  However, it transposes the game to a Vienna Gambit in a Vienna Game, which is not bad, but if you want to play a Vienna Gambit, I'd suggest a different order of moves.  The a1 rook sometimes feels like a missed asset in my games.  In fact, if I had had earlier access to it in some of my other games, I would have definitely won.  I would say the next move here is a matter of taste for white."
48,4,2,fxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"In this game, I decided to gobble up the e5 pawn.  This does a lot of good for white for three reasons: One, because it forces black to respond with his knight, he either under-develops or takes the e4 pawn; two, it brings a pawn to the e5 square, which quite frankly can cramp black's game and become extra fodder against black depending (and as we will see in this game); and, three, because taking the e4 pawn is absolutely what black will do, this brings the knight into an isolated square that makes it prone to early game harassment and potentially an easy capture.  (Note, that the knight will now no longer be able to move back to d6 or f6 because of the e5 pawn.)"
49,4,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/4n3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"At this point, white must play Nf3 or g3 to prevent Qh4+.  (There might actually be other moves white can make.  I haven't actually considered others yet.  Let me know if you find others.)  The pawn to g3 is definitely rubbish compared to Nf3 since the latter develops a piece and clears the king side for castling.  For those of you still very new to the King's Gambit, consider what would happen if play went like this: 4. a3 Qh4+.  What can white do in this situation?  See if you can identify the permutations; it isn't too challenging."

The obvious threat is either Nf2 or Bf2.  Either one will take away castling rights (I'd like Bf2 better because it brings the king to an uncomfy square), but the only real move white can make to counter this is arguably the best move.  Not only will black have to respond by retreating the bishop (or be down material, but we'll assume that's not an option), it also further isolates the knight by taking away the c5 square for retreat."

I think Be7 is probably the best move black can make because it provides some material to defend the king side, which is what the King's Gambit aims to obliterate for black as far as I understand the opening, and provides two defenders on the g5 square- the only square black's knight can feasibly run away to.  Bb6 could make the dark square bishop useless for black for most of the game considering white's pawn structure.  Bb4+ is also complete rubbish because it gives white free development with c3.  (As white, do not play Nc3 to defend against Bb4+.  If it isn't obvious, I recommend the reader play the permutation out and find the winning moves for black as an exercise.)"
53,4,7,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/8/4P3/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"At this point in the game, I felt it was important for me to consider where I could sacrifice my pieces- yes, sacrifice them.  Back in ye olde days of chess, when this opening was still played competitively, Grandmasters were encouraged to play ""gutsy"" and wild by sacrificing their pieces for positional advantages.  I considered playing Bc4 with the idea of potentially sacrificing my bishop on f7 to bring black's king out.  I have seen this sacrificial play made before.  (I'll provide a reference game once I find it in my notes and update this post.)  However, in this position, it looked like black was going to castle king side, so if bringing his king out was the positional advantage I was looking for, then d3 was a better square for my bishop.  Plus it threatens his knight and gives me more tempo.  Yay!"

His knight now has Nxf3 or Ne6 in the way of moves.  If he takes my knight, then I could simply develop my queen and put it in file with my rook on his f7 pawn.  It would put black in a position where castling king side seems favorable (especially with my e5 pawn there), which is what any player utilizing the King's Gambit will often want.  Because this opening is often attempting to pulverize black's king side pawn structure, for black to castle king side is giving white a positional edge... in my opinion."

It seemed like black could simply take a free rook, right?  Of course, if he does, then the white queen takes black's bishop forcing the black king into a corner on the g8 square.  This should be real bad for black and a mating net probably existed, but I wasn't sure.  This is perhaps another tactical exercise for the reader; can you identify what can happen to black if he plays 11. ... gxf6?  I'll provide a hint to the solution in two slides (look for $$).

In addition, I was treating this like a Philidor's Defense since after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 white's best move is 3.d4  The idea is that when black advances his pawn one square in the opening, white's best off playing d4 next.

What I was weary of was the possibility of ...Nh4 which I was concerned about. I then asked myself what would become of that. I then thought that this wouldn't cost me either because if ...Nh4, I have Bg4 to stop any threat that's coming. Therefore, it wasn't about trust or not, but what kind of threat I was dealing with.

I went wrong by not looking at the entire board which both bhidragon and Coach Stockel have mentioned.  Not only is Stanley now threatening mate, but I can't bring my Q into play without losing it.  And, even if I gave up my Q, this would only delay but not prevent mate.

When we went over the game, Stanley said that my decisive mistake was taking with the B as that allowed him to swarm in.  Although I don't enjoy exchanging N for B, I think that Bf3 would've been the only move to keep me in. As after exchanging with ...Nxf3, Qxf3 my Q is in play and stops any threats that Stanley had against my K.  So, it's not about trust as I didn't trust him.  Therefore, the moral of this story is to look at the entire board, even the small threats.  By looking at everything here, I overlooked an important threat which costed me the game."

What I didn't realize is that the N is on the same which prevents black from being able to play 10...Na5.  Therefore, it wasn't forced here, but rather I didn't calculate accurately.  That's because with Ghost Vision, you get the pieces; or things like where they're located mixed up which is what happened here.  But, it doesn't work as Nathan will force me to exchange my B for his N.  With that being said, Nathan accurately said that this exchange is going to favor him.
