It does however confine his king to the back rank.  Normally a rook on your opponent's seventh rank is called ""a bone in the throat""."

In the meantime me and my rook decide to liquidate black's queenside pawns and get a passer of my own.  It seems to be another Battle of the Wings Part 2 only this time my passer never gets to leave the second rank black's passer is on the 7th at the end!
64,4,22,5Rc8,b'2R5/8/6pk/5p2/5P2/6P1/1KP1r2p/8 b - -',"52. Rc8 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated over the last few moves as planned and if black queens his pawn then I play my rook to h8 and give him a skewie.  Black sees this though and forces resignation by playing his rook to e7 because it will interpose on h7 and the pawn will safely queen.  It was time to hold out the white flag to my opponent on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.

As far as the Experts are concerned I still have a way to go to reach half point heaven but I was told that I did at least make the game interesting which is a step in the right direction towards such a goal.

Look forward to your feedback everyone!  Cheers and bye for now.  Joanne"

Just in case there is any uncertainty with regards to the rules of this popular game here is a summarised version of the 'Blide Verpoinian Chess rules'

___
1.1 Nature and Objectives:


All pieces behave in the same way as they do in conventional chess moves alternate as usual.

The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king the game is a draw.
___
6.1 Special Rules:

If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose' 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable.

If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion.

If for any reason either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.

He had a controversial chess style - at the time a respected only-recently-retired chess analyst commenting on one of his games had remarked; 'his moves are stupid his tactics are stupid he's impatient and he's an outrageous cheater - If he gets to the final I'll retire'. This tournament was said to have been the first he had ever entered and won his first game against Garl Trowlaph (no. 4 in the Wackyworld chess standings) with an astonishing 600000 to 1 odds against him.

the referee repeated 'which piece are you going to promote to?'
'I wanna promote to pawn' said Jabborg 
'that's not allowed' 'it's allowed if I says it's allowed' 'well I'm sorry but you have to choose between a rook knight bishop or queen' (the nervous phrappenite had begun to sweat) Jabborg's brutish arm had picked up the referee by his wings and threatened 'I don't think you heard me right mate I promote to a pawn otherwise I'm going to promote you to a friggin sack of phrappenite body parts'.

After the referee shrugged his shoulders and gestured to continue play Safeway angrily grasped his d1 rook and violently swiped the newly promoted knight off the board off the table and landing with a loud 'clang-clang-splatch' in Jabborg's spittoon (Jabborg was rarely known to be without his spittoon - he was a regular grophacco chewer)
84,5,18,5Bxg8,b'2nrrnb1/2bqk3/8/8/8/5PB1/6KN/2R2BNR w - -',Feeling offended Jabborg responded by grabbing the f7 bishop and using his other hand violently flicking the white queen off the table and smashing into a portrait of the 1st ever Kweedite chess champion 'The great Alphrom Saph' knocking it off the wall and falling to pieces on the ground. It was known that at this moment Safeway stubbed out his gropherette rolled up his sleeves rubbed his hands and embarked on the most aggressive play ever known in Verponian chess history.

93,5,27,6f5,b'rn3kB1/n7/8/5P2/8/8/6KN/6NR b - -',"For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' -
 a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty' over the years the expression was adopted in many sports including cloud-surfing cloud-skiing cloud-jesting cloud-chestnuting cloud-chess and eventually chess."

100,5,34,7Ke4,b'rn6/n7/3k4/8/4K3/8/7N/6NR b - -',With both players reluctant to attack with their corner-fort resources the game was apparently going nowhere. At this point the referee suggested to both players that they take a break and then finish the game with a 'Habbajoop duel' - Jabborg and Safeway enthusiastically agreed and adjourned to their respective dressing rooms. The referee then activated the Moonlagoom Hall tannoy (which is also connected to a speaker system in Moonlagoom park) and announced that the game was to be decided by a 'Habbajoop duel' and a 5 minute intermission would take place.
101,5,35,Kb2,b'rn6/n5K1/8/8/8/8/1k5N/6NR w - -',During the intermission the chess records explain that after the referee had set-up the board to habbajoop formation there was curious discussion taking place within the audience - many spectators were asking each other if they knew what a 'habbajoop duel' was. The sympathetic Phrappenite referee decided to use the tannoy to explain the rules and use the chess board (which was projected on a wall in Moonlagoom hall as well as clearly visible to spectators outside via video screen) to demonstrate the nature of the game.

Lord Jabborg quickly stood up and roared; 'MAGGOT MOOSE!!!'. Jabborg (still stood up) viciously hurled Safeway off the chess board and after plonking the white rook on a1 -

Lord Jabborg (holding up the recently-captured white rook in one hand and the Krompoborg trophy in the other) was staring out to the audience with a victorious mad glare laughing like a maniac. His evil laugh was apparently heard as far as the Graw City outskirts and a commentator of the match had likened his powerful winning-player manner to the intimidating personality of a political dictator. 1 month following this game Lord Jabborg had become mayor of Graw city 1 year later he had become president of Zaltang and 6 months after that the Verponian race had declared war on the Purple ocean and many races (particularly Kweedites) had been chased out of their homes separated from their families brutally tortured or even destroyed. Good game!

Nd5 14.g6! fxg6 15.Qg4 Qe7 when white can play Bg2-e4 building pressure or just take on g6.  With white in this opening Kramnik has favored that line but I think most white players prefer to not give black that option.

Qxb7 19.dxe6 and we see white explode the game open while attacking the black queen on the long diagonal.  This opening is extremely tactical it's almost always based on finding the right way to open the position.

a) 24... Kb6 25.Qd6 Ka5 26.dxe8=Q  is easily winning or 25... Kb5 26.Nc7  or 24... Kb7 25.Qc7  Ka8 26.exd8=Q

So what about an earlier a4?  28.a4  and both takebacks are interesting:

28... Kxa4 29.b3 Kxb3 and there are discoveries but black has great pawns for stopping checks and he should be fine.

28... Qxa4 29.Nd6  Ka5 (29... Kb6 30.Qb7  mates) and again I doubt that white's got more than a perpetual.

I hope you enjoyed this lively game that seems to draw doubt upon the move 19.Qd5.  It's a great theoretical dispute and I wish more players played the botvinnik so that we could see more of these kinds of developments.  Perhaps I'll annotate a game with 19.Kxf1 next or with 16.Na4.  If you have comments I'd love to hear them."

198,9,3,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White chooses the Yusupov-Rubinstein system. I know very little about Queen's Pawn openings (why am I annotating this game?) but this seems to be fairly passive. The pawn on d4 is not in need of support and now how will the Bishop on c1 be developed? 
199,9,4,b6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Aiming to fianchetto the Queen's Bishop to exert pressure on the long diagonal and to increase control of d5 and e4 in the center.
200,9,5,Nbd2,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Playing the Knight to d2 rather than c3 allows the c-pawn to be pushed to c4 to fight for control over the d5 square or to c3 to support the d4 pawn. This Knight also helps White to control the important c4 and e4 squares.  The Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop but it wasn't going anywhere anyway.
201,9,6,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Developing the Bishop aiming to exert pressure on the center with the minor pieces.
202,9,7,Bc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is a deviation from theory. Bd3 is normal aiming at h7 and fighting for control of e4. At c4 the Bishop is subject to harassment from Black's advancing Queenside pawns. Perhaps White was trying to provoke d5 which would severely restrict the scope of the Bishop on b7.
203,9,8,c5,b'rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2BP4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq c6',Attacking White's center offering to exchange a c-pawn for one of White's central pawns.

207,9,12,Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/4N3/2BP4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',This move is a puzzle. White still has not developed his Queen's Bishop and the Knight although temporarily centrally located can be easily driven off before any threats develop. Perhaps white was hoping to provoke some sort of overreaction to this seemingly aggressive move.
208,9,13,Bb5,b'rn1q1rk1/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This move is also a puzzle to me. White seems to have wasted the last two moves not losing any material but losing time. This is the second piece that White has moved twice during the opening phase of the game breaking one of the cardinal rules of chess.
209,9,14,Qc7,b'rn3rk1/pbqpbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Developing the Queen to c7 exerting pressure along the c-file and the b8-h2 diagonal. Black has continued developing normally ignoring White's premature advance of the Bishop and Knight.
210,9,15,1Re1,b'rn3rk1/pbqpbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Developing the Rook on the half-open e-file.

212,9,17,1Nd3,b'rn3rk1/pbq1bppp/1p1ppn2/1B6/3P4/3N4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The Knight is probably better placed at f3 where it aids in the King's defense and does not obstruct White's other pieces.
213,9,18,1Nbd7,b'r4rk1/pbqnbppp/1p1ppn2/1B6/3P4/3N4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Developing the Knight. Nc6 was also an option locating the Knight more centrally but I chose to not obstruct the scope of the Queen or the Bishop by placing it on d7. Note however that the Queen's protection of the Bishop on e7 is now obstructed. This could come into play with a pin of the Knight on f6 by the c1 Bishop or an advance of the central pawns.  Perhaps Nc6 would have been a better choice.
214,9,19,a6,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/pp1ppn2/1B6/3P4/2PN4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Gaing more space with tempo due to the poor placement of white's Bishop.

217,9,22,1e4,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3Pp3/1NPN4/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Rather than liquidating the center black gains a significant space advantage and restricts the movement of the White pieces.
218,9,23,d5,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p4n2/1p1p4/3PpN2/1NP5/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',White's Queen Bishop has now lost its influence over much of the a8-h1 diagonal but Black's compensation in central control and space is more than adequate. The squares weakened by Black's central advance (c5 and e5) are well covered by the Knight and Bishop on d7 and e7.

I think that White would have been better to trade Bishops. This would have forced Black to choose between either recapting on d6 and allowing White to partially untangle his position or ignoring the Bishop capture and launching an all-out do-or-die attack on the White King.

This bisshop move has the disadvantage of blocking the pawn behind it and this makes it more difficult to ""develop"" the other bisshop.

349,13,3,Qxg1#,b'r3kbn1/pp3pp1/2p1p1p1/8/4p3/5n2/PPPPBP2/R1BQ1Kq1 w q -',Lessons learned. Try not to block your own pieces. And keep an eye on your King. He should be protected as best as you can.
350,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I had a peak at my opponents past games and seen he played the Sicilian when posed with 1.e4 and I though that it would be an interesting game seeing as I had come off of some nice positions in previous games against the Sicilian. Except against Marin.....that doesn't count :)
351,14,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As expected. Here i was thinking of playing 2.d4 and attempting the morra gambit where white loses material for development after cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3. However i had never played that gambit before and was unsure where it would lead so played the sounder 2.Nf6.
352,14,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Sicilian Najdorf Ivkov variation which usually leads to interesting middle games so i have read and so it turns out. Here i was expecting Qa5 which would continue the mainline to which white would respond with Qd2. Also all moves to date are book and on the GK database pretty popular.
353,14,3,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/4n1B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',This was a pretty unusual move and i couldn't find a variation on any website when i was doing this annotation to talk about it more. Although it forces the LSB back it has no real benefit as now white can win more territory and gain a tempi from black after Bb3 Nc6 reverting to another line of the Sicilian. Perhaps black should have waited and continued with the mainline so he can achieve more development as at the moment black has an inactive bishop.
354,14,4,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/4n1B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',This now makes the bishop more active but also closes the LSBs path It also pins the knight to the queen these are typical in the sicilian opening but perhaps something that could be exploited.
355,14,5,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/4n1B1/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq f3',A very aggressive response by white taking a stronger stance in the centre of the board and forcing the knight to go on the run.
356,14,6,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppnn1/6B1/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',(?) I am giving this as Nc6 seems more benficial and continues the strength of the sicilian where this now gives attacking options to white. IMHO white looks slighty stronger after this move. 
357,14,7,1f5,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppnn1/5PB1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Continuing the pursuit of the knight to the view white should come out looking as strong as it went in and has the opportunity to exploit blacks 8th move e6.
358,14,8,1O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1nn1/5pB1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The idea behind this is 11.... fxe4 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Nxe4 Be7 14. Qf3 giving white a good position although a pawn down however after blacks next move white has a good advantage and should be able to capitalise.
359,14,9,1Be7,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1nn1/5pB1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Declining the pawn instead opting for defence. which now allows white to disrupt blacks knight again.
360,14,10,Ne5,b'r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4nPB1/3N4/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',only safe place apart from f8 which does nothing except clog up blacks back line and prevents castling.

Applying pressure along the e file with a view to add more pressure to the knight with bishop and queen. Blacks position is soley a defensive counter attacking position so white still has to be careful of the king on g1 as a check on him could hand back an advantage to black even though white does have the slightest of advantages.

This allows a neat combo (reason for Ra-d1 it will become apparent why) which gives white a good attacking option and black a headache! I can see why it was played so black can move Ne5 and protect the bishop. Although i think Bc6 is much better.
365,14,15,1Nd5,b'r3r1k1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/3NnP2/3N1B2/1B6/PPP1Q1PP/3RR1K1 b - -',This now allows white to carry out a small attack that is as subtle as a sledgehammer. It is not a winning attack apart from more position and it does ask alot of questions of black.
366,14,16,1Nxd5,b'r3r1k1/1pqbbppp/p2p4/3nnP2/3N1B2/1B6/PPP1Q1PP/3RR1K1 w - -',expected allows black to free the bishop and protect the knight.

Now if white swaps rooks white is not In as strong a position as it could be. I also adopted the philosophy that the attacker should not swap pieces unless it is beneficial in the circumstances. therefore...

371,14,21,2Be6,b'r3r1k1/1pq2p1p/p2pb1n1/3B3Q/3R1B2/8/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Was thinking Qxc2 might be played however i dont think that is such a good move after Rd2 black is forced back and white then has initiative from a similar position to this.

375,14,25,2Kg7,b'r3r3/1pq3kp/p2pbpn1/3B3Q/3R4/2P3B1/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',From here white takes the material advantage as well as the positional one.
376,14,26,2Qf3,b'r3r3/1pq3kp/p2pbpn1/3B4/3R4/2P2QB1/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',a double attack on f6 and b7 pawns.

379,14,29,2Bc6,b'4r3/r4qkp/p1Bpbpn1/8/3R4/2P2QB1/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',threatening rook also prevents any reinforcement to the d6 pawn which is getting eyed up by both rook and bishop.
380,14,30,2Rb8,b'1r6/r4qkp/p1Bpbpn1/8/3R4/2P2QB1/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',sensing the fate of the d6 pawn black now trys for a trade of pawns though allowing the rook onto my back lines is not a very inviting option.
381,14,31,2Qf2,b'1r6/r4qkp/p1Bpbpn1/8/3R4/2P3B1/PP3QPP/5RK1 b - -',(!!) This move now protects the pawn and is on the line to threaten rook and has the future option of harrassing the king on g7. something that is very beneficial if it can be developed a little more.
382,14,32,2Bxa2,b'1r6/r4qkp/p1Bp1pn1/8/3R4/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 w - -',Alot better than Rxb2 had i played Rxd6.
383,14,33,2Rxd6,b'1r6/r4qkp/p1BR1pn1/8/8/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 b - -',The trade of pawns which now gives white an awesome attack the f6 pawn with 3 major pieces. Note: The Queen also eyes up the rook on a7.
384,14,34,2Rf8,b'5r2/r4qkp/p1BR1pn1/8/8/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 w - -',giving more fire power to the defence of f6. 
385,14,35,3Rxf6,b'5r2/r4qkp/p1B2Rn1/8/8/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 b - -',This starts some very dubious moves by black.
386,14,36,3Qe7,b'5r2/r3q1kp/p1B2Rn1/8/8/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 w - -',What was wrong with Qxf6? Qxa7  Rf7 and see where that takes whites attack. This now loses the game for black indefinitely however the way white wins is helped by blacks choice of moves.
387,14,37,3Rxf8,b'5R2/r3q1kp/p1B3n1/8/8/2P3B1/bP3QPP/5RK1 b - -',This now allows white to go ahead 5pts including a minor piece.
388,14,38,Kg8,b'5nk1/r3q2p/p1B5/8/3Q4/2P3B1/bP4PP/5RK1 w - -',probably the best move for black as Kg6 or Kh6 although there are alot of options open to blacks king he will be harrassed and i am sure the long walk for the king would result in mate or the loss of the queen.
389,14,39,3Rxf8+,b'5Rk1/r3q2p/p1B5/8/3Q4/2P3B1/bP4PP/6K1 b - -',taking with king is a terrible move as Bd6 is lying in wait.
390,14,40,3Qxa7,b'5qk1/Q6p/p1B5/8/8/2P3B1/bP4PP/6K1 b - -',A rather nice final attack from white if i do say so myself :) Black now throwns in the towel but does not resign just yet.
391,14,41,Kg7,b'Q7/6kp/p1B5/5q2/8/2P3B1/bP4PP/6K1 w - -',checking king and getting on same diagonal as bishop in order to harrass blacks queen.
392,14,42,3Qa7+,b'8/Q5kp/p7/6q1/4B3/2P3B1/bP4PP/6K1 b - -',Bf7 prolongs the match however black plays.

I should say from the position they are 2 forced mates.

2. Kf8 Bd6  Ke8 Bc6 Kd8 Qd7#

I hope you enjoyed the game and found something useful somewhere in here. Any comments are welcome as if i missed something or didn't see value in moves which had been played or not played i'd appreicate you pointing them out to me.

396,15,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',A very strange looking move. I believe it to be a bad move. I've talked to my opponent about this particular move after the game. He believes it's OK.
397,15,3,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',It can be dangerous to move the Queen out just three moves into the game. But in this position I believe it to be alright. White can play 3 things. I think them all to be bad. 
398,15,4,Kf1,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq -',This would be the best of the moves. It can be ok though. White can play Nf3 kicking out the Queen and moving Kf6 followed by Rf1 or Rf2.
399,15,5,g5,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq g6',Now my obvious idea is to rush a King side attack.

407,15,13,Nh5,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/8/7n/2BPP1pq/2N3p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR w kq -',Moving the Knight twice. Maybe black had a better move? Push a pawn or develop the dark squared Bishop.
408,15,14,Nd5,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/8/3N3n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR b kq -',Threatening Nc7  winning the rook. Black can't play Bd6 or Na6 to guard the c7 square. If Bd7 then e5. If Na6 then Bxa6.

The situation looks under control.  Another race will start soon. Both of us need back up from our kings.   
561,20,59,4bxc5,b'2n5/2P4p/5ppk/P1P1p3/8/8/4KP2/8 b - -',The exchange took place. Things are looking a little rosier.

570,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The first 15 moves are discussed in two of my other botvinnik (#3&4) annotations so I'm not going to re-discuss it here.  16.Na4 is where the annotation will begin.

Rb1 stops the knight being taken because the opening of the b file is very powerful and so that black queen goes to a6 this brings the knight out of danger with tempo.  The black queen now has the option of b5 and the value of white's knight is unclear it might be out on the rim but it might be a useful piece in an attack as black has a lot of potential weaknesses.
572,21,2,1a3,b'2kr1b1r/pb1n1p2/4pP2/1qpP2B1/Npp5/P5P1/1P3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Questioning the pawn if it takes (or stays where it is) white opens the a file and if it advances Nc3 comes with tempo on the black queen.

The mistake isn't a strategical one strategically this is a move black wants to make but tactically the knight's unguarded.  Perhaps 17... exd5 as played by Shirov later is better but Ivanchuk did get a beautiful win against him out of it with a queen sacrifice on g7 (that was apparently found over the board).
574,21,4,1axb4,b'2kr1b1r/pb3p2/4pP2/1qpPn1B1/NPp5/6P1/1P3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White correctly exchanges opening the a file and giving black one less defensive pawn to block white's path.
575,21,5,1Qd4,b'2kr1b1r/pb3p2/4pP2/1q1Pn1B1/NppQ4/6P1/1P3PBP/R4RK1 b - -',! This is Kamsky's brilliant find.  The knight and pawn are forked though black has what looks like a clever response.

This queen sacrifice opens up lines while getting a defended pawn on the seventh black gets two pieces for the queen but the pawn on b7 will be a huge threat and the fewer pieces in front of black's king the looser Kramnik's queenside looks.
578,21,8,2Be3,b'5b1r/pPk2p2/4pP2/1q6/Nppr4/4B1P1/1P3PBP/R4RK1 b - -',The bishop was attacked so it moves with tempo 22.Bf4  is probably well met by 22... Rxf4 23.gxf4 Rg8 with some pressure also remember if white doesn't force something black can make a passed pawn with c3.
579,21,9,2e5,b'5b1r/pPk2p2/5P2/1q2p3/Nppr4/4B1P1/1P3PBP/R4RK1 w - -',Black gives back an exchange instead of ceding tempo to white after a rook move Bxa7-b6  would be very dangerous.
580,21,10,2Nc3,b'5b1r/pPk2p2/5P2/1q2p3/1ppr4/2N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R4RK1 b - -',! We've seen this kind of potential sacrifice in the 16.Rb1 lines (where the knight cannot be taken) and this has the same plan give up a piece to open the b file against a misplaced queen or king in this case it supports the b pawns advance as well.
581,21,11,2bxc3,b'5b1r/pPk2p2/5P2/1q2p3/2pr4/2P1B1P1/5PBP/R4RK1 b - -',And not only does the b file get opened but it comes with tempo!
582,21,12,2Bc5,b'7r/pPk2p2/5P2/1qb1p3/2pr4/2P1B1P1/5PBP/R4RK1 w - -',A rook retreat is met Rfb1.  This move brings the h8 rook into the defense of b8 and covers d4 but the b file has not been covered however how could he cover it?  The position is shattering and I don't believe black has a way out.
583,21,13,2cxd4,b'7r/pPk2p2/5P2/1qb1p3/2pP4/4B1P1/5PBP/R4RK1 b - -',Why not?
584,21,14,2Bxd4,b'7r/pPk2p2/5P2/1q2p3/2pb4/4B1P1/5PBP/R4RK1 w - -',The bishop may win tempo at some point on the a1 rook and if it's taken black will have a strong pawn dui on c4 and d4.
585,21,15,2Ra6,b'7r/pPk2p2/R4P2/2q1p3/2pb4/4B1P1/5PBP/1R4K1 b - -',The rook moves out of the attack while perhaps threatening Rc6 .

587,21,17,2Bc1,b'1r6/pPk2p2/R4P2/2q1p3/2pb4/6P1/5PBP/1RB3K1 b - -',! So instead white finds a way of reorganizing his pieces so that his bishop can sneak around black's dark squared bishop via a3.  Taking on f2 doesn't help black as then he'll have the extra  worry about his loose bishop on f2 after 28... Bxf2  29.Kf1
588,21,18,2c3,b'1r6/pPk2p2/R4P2/2q1p3/3b4/2p3P1/5PBP/1RB3K1 w - -',Notice that Ba3 would have trapped(!) the black queen he gives it breathing room.
589,21,19,3Bc6+,b'1r6/pP1k1p2/R1BB1P2/4p3/2qb4/2p3P1/5P1P/1R4K1 b - -',The bishop on d6 cannot be taken because of the discovery on b5.  This move is stronger that 31.Bxb8 because the a6 rook is attacked 31.Bxb8 Qxa6 32.Bc7 c2 would give black hope.
590,21,20,3Bb5,b'1r6/pP3p2/R2BkP2/1B2p3/2qb4/2p3P1/5P1P/1R4K1 b - -',Winning tempo and threatening discoveries white's rooks and bishops work together perfectly.

594,21,24,4Rc7+,b'2k5/2R2p2/1r3P2/4B3/2B5/2p2KP1/7q/4R3 b - -',And black resigned in light of being hopelessly lost.  41... Kb8 walks into a wind mill and 41... Kd8 42.Rd1  Qd2 (42... Ke8 43.Bxf7  Kf8 44.Re8#) is simply lost he's down two bishop after his queen is taken (sadly white doesn't have 43.Rh1 because of 43... Rxf6  44.Bxf6 Kxc7).  Kamsky pulled off this win by giving up his queen for two pieces in order to place a dominating pawn on b7 with two very long scoped bishops supporting it that together dominated the board not only that but he opened the a and b files to great effect in the botvinnik black has very loose pawns one of white's goals is to open up files 16.Rb1 goes for that but 16.Na4 followed by a3 is another completely viable and very dangerous plan.  I think the most remarkable thing about this game is that black got no counterplay (except his slight prayer for a perpetual at the end) in one of the most dicey and counterattacking openings white's queen sacrifice tied Kramnik down completely.  Kudos to Kamsky.  if you have any comments or variations I'd love to hear it.  I'm never sure how many variations to stick in and when to stick to descriptions.

For the first 8 moves I have been following the database but I accepted these moves because they do have a clear purpose.  The database is very thin in fact there is only one illustrative game with this move in the 1500  database and not in the 1900s.  It suggests I take on c6 but after doing an analyse the board I find that my pawn structure will be broken up.  I therefore decide to give my c pawn pawn backup.

I would then put my knight on the c4 outpost hitting at the a pawn.  31. Kf1 should have been played.  I play it next move but it turns out to be one move too late and I get caned well and truly by my Master opponent.

I can move the knight away to b1 for example but he will then play his king to e2 next move cleaning up all the pawns on the kingside.

In the endgame if in doubt - get king out!!"

723,27,7,Nc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/1N6/2n5/8/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w Kkq -',This move suggests that Carlsberg may be inviting Jabborg to a 'cross-knight-swap' a superstitious ritual which is usually played among lobsterian sages. The ritual is known to 'clean the game of evil' and both players will live prosperously.

729,27,13,1f3,b'1rbqkbr1/pppppppp/8/8/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/1RBQKBR1 b - -',Jabborg is known to favour pawns over all other pieces. He once played 760 consecutive games using only his pawns and remarkably won 2 of them.

731,27,15,Rb8,b'1rbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/8/P1P2P2/1P1PP1PP/1RBQKBR1 w - -',Sure enough Carlsberg has commited to taunting his opponents pawns and reserving energy within his pieces
732,27,16,Rg8,b'1rbqkbr1/pppppppp/8/8/PPPPPPPP/8/8/1RBQKBR1 w - -',With Jabborg's pawns regrouping on the 4th Rank it will be interesting how Carslberg will respond. If he decides to advance his front line it would surely be a merciless pawn battle similar to that of the famous pawn battle between Count Gok and Proffessor of Flimanin Science Peetabob Haphomski.

734,27,18,4Rb1,b'r1bqkbr1/8/8/4pp2/2p1p2p/8/8/1RBQKBR1 b - -',With the game going through somewhat of a sag in excitement it was said to have have been remarked by Carsberg in his deep croaky voice 'now we ball-race'. Carlsberg was a fan of ball-racing around pawns it was a tradition among some lobsterian types and he was said to always offer a ball-race if he was playing as black.
735,27,19,4Bh6,b'r1bqk1r1/8/7b/4pp2/2p1p2p/8/8/1RBQKBR1 w - -',And so Carlsberg decides the ball-race will be Chazakwise (named after Wackyworld's moon which rotates around the planet. This term's opposite is Chopawise which was a considerably smaller moon that rotated in the opposite direction. It was destroyed in a head on collision 109 years ago the event was named 'the great moon reduction of 99')

Carsberg recovered from his frustration glanced at the board and decided that Jabborg was right.
738,27,22,6Qg1#,b'8/8/8/4pk2/r3pp1p/2p5/3R4/RQBbK1q1 w - -',The checkmating move was delivered mercilessly. Following his final move Carslberg was known to have stood up from his bean bag and cried out to his wife 'Fneeba! Fneeba! I won again!'. It is known that Jabborg's family feasted on 2 roast lobsters that evening.

It would looks something similar to the line below but could be far more complicated.  The simple rule to maintain opposition is to copy your opponent (move diagonal if s/he does don't if s/he doesn't).  Opposition switches anytime another piece is moved so be sure to account for pawns moves to obtain the desired final position.

963,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1. e4 very common allows for an exciting attacking match compared to 1. d4.
964,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Start of the Sicilian an opening which i have became accustomed to playing against and playing with. If played properly can cause your opponent real problems. white must play carefully as this is a very useful counter attacking opening compared to others.
965,39,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I find this the best way to respond when in this position.
966,39,3,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Common opening here. I have played from this position many times as white.
967,39,4,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Easily dealt with and whites response asks black the question of the exchange after black either protects bishop after Nb3 or moves bishop to safety.
968,39,5,Bb6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"This now gives white an ""extra move"" which is used for development of whites pieces."
969,39,6,Qf6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2pq2/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Trying for mate on f2! Disappointed with this move the queen has been moved out to early and now is a target for white to attack/develop pieces.
970,39,7,f4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2pq2/8/4PP2/1NN5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq f3',This opens the diagonal for the queen prevents Qf2 and now hopefully can be used to open up the DSB's diagonal.
971,39,8,e5,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b3q2/4p3/4PP2/1NN5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I think this move is a major factor why black lost the match. It allows the knight into a very good position (d5) which will cause problems for black and can not be moved easily as there are no pawns which are able to threaten it.
972,39,9,Nd5,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b3q2/3Np3/4PP2/1N6/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"Into good position forking queen and bishop. Again forcing black to make a move of a ""developed piece"""
973,39,10,Qd8,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b6/3Np3/4PP2/1N6/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',To look at the board here my position is far superior and now have a game only I can lose. Black is underdeveloped and all whites lines are open with the exception of DSB however after fxe5 that will be available. White has had tempi from very early and now dictates the game. 
974,39,11,Qg4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b6/3Np3/4PPQ1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Brings the queen into game on a very strong position and threatens blacks rook.

Defence of the king is easily taking care of if Ba5 is played with c3. Pressure is relieved from black if white plays Nxa5 as Queen can then escape from its position where it is now trapped.
977,39,14,1h5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p2/1b4p1/3NP2p/4P1Q1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq h6',Now white has all diagonals open for bishops the knights are situated for defensive/attacking duties ideally and once queen is moved to g3 to protect e5 pawn which is major in whites attack as this prevents black from alot of options and helps keep blacks queen trapped. white is strolling. Note: Qf4 closes bishops diagonal.
978,39,15,1Qg3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p2/1b4p1/3NP2p/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',White now can wait to exploit blacks limited moves. 11. ..h4 12. Qg4 not as strong a position for queen but still is enough to over run black.

981,39,18,1exf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pn3/1bn2Pp1/1B1N2Bp/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',continued advancement of the pawn. black can not move knight as this results in the loss of blacks queen after f7 .

This is a game i am very proud of as although black does make some questionably moves i keep initiative throughout and force black to throw away position and material.

If anything has to be taken from this game then it should be to attack queens that have been introduced to the game early with development and the obvious; well developed opponent should always beat under developed opponent.

Hope you enjoyed the game
