Thanks all and thanks L-d-j for all the help and working with me. This is a very quick game that ends in resign.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Back to back king pawns opening
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Knight to f3
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',black moves knight to c6
4,0,4,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I prepare to move my pawn to d4 and also free up the diagonal for my queen.
5,0,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I think he is preparing to fianchetto bishop.
6,0,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I move bishop to c4 after I notice black's weakness in the middle so I eye down f7 with lsb.

8,0,8,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I know that I am leaving e4 pawn vulnerable with this move but my plan is to move knight or bishop to g5 which is bad because then if ne4 then the knight will be defending g5. which is what will happen
9,0,9,exd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',black pawn take on d4

11,0,11,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/8/2BPn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Then of course knight takes pawn on e4
12,0,12,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/8/2BPn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle
13,0,13,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2nb2p1/8/2BPn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',black bishop to d6 . Getting ready to castle. Black is desperately trying to keep the knight from getting pinned and the king checked that he is leaving his knight undefended.
14,0,14,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2nb2p1/8/2BPn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',So I go for the knight with my rook still pinning the knight.
15,0,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1p1p/2nb2p1/8/2BPn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',Black castle's

19,0,19,1Nb4,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1p1p/3b2p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1Q1K1 w - -',I think this is an ok move considering the move that would follow. but also a bad move. better would be to finish developing black's pieces.
20,0,20,1Bg5,b'r1bqr1k1/pppp1p1p/3b2p1/6B1/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',I believe this is a great move trapping the queen. black's queen can't take bishop obviously because of the f3 knight defending.
21,0,21,1Re7,b'r1bq2k1/pppprp1p/3b2p1/6B1/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 w - -',black rook to e7..I think a better move for black would have been pawn to f6. but black had not many options
22,0,22,1Bxe7,b'r1bq2k1/ppppBp1p/3b2p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',I take with my bishop.

24,0,24,1Bxd6,b'r1b1q1k1/pppp1p1p/3B2p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',I take black's bishop at the same time threatning black's queen.
25,0,25,1Qd8,b'r1bq2k1/pppp1p1p/3B2p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 w - -',Black moves queen back to d8
26,0,26,1Be7,b'r1bq2k1/ppppBp1p/6p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',I move my bishop back trying again.
27,0,27,1Qe8,b'r1b1q1k1/ppppBp1p/6p1/8/1nBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 w - -',Black does the same.
28,0,28,1Bxb4,b'r1b1q1k1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/1BBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',So I take black's other knight.
29,0,29,1Qf8,b'r1b2qk1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/1BBPR3/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 w - -',black queen f8. bad move again. I could take here with my bishop. But I don't know if I missed this or I saw a better move but...
30,0,30,1Re8,b'r1b1Rqk1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/1BBP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 b - -',I think rook to e8 was a better move.
31,0,31,1Qxe8,b'r1b1q1k1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/1BBP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2Q1K1 w - -',queen takes my rook.
32,0,32,1Qxe8+,b'r1b1Q1k1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/1BBP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN4K1 b - -',and I retake with my queen also checking black's king.
33,0,33,1Kg7,b'r1b1Q3/pppp1pkp/6p1/8/1BBP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN4K1 w - -',Black's king is on the run. It's pretty much lost from here as I think of ways to checkmate.
34,0,34,2h3#,b'r1b5/pppp3p/6p1/3Q4/2BP2k1/5N1P/PP1B1PP1/RN4K1 b - -',
35,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',here i began another game in high hopes and an aim to win
36,1,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',but i also wanted to do something different to my usual e4 so i decided to try and play something like the 'modern' opening
37,1,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',still playing the developing moves
38,1,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',here i am only moving my pawns to the 6th row!
39,1,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',white played the very common Bc4
40,1,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',but now it is time for other pieces apart from pawns to advance
41,1,6,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',but white prefers pawns
42,1,7,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq d6',i'm now in a more agressive mood
43,1,8,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3P4/2B5/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',a very likely move (other option is to play something like e5?)
44,1,9,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',not going to stay a pawn down
45,1,10,Qe2+,b'rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',white wants an early check to keep this game rolling
46,1,11,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/p1p1bppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',probably my best option apart from Be6
47,1,12,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/p1p1bppp/1p3n2/1B1p4/8/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',still checking!
48,1,13,c6,b'rnbqk2r/p3bppp/1pp2n2/1B1p4/8/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',i play my pawn pushing again
49,1,14,Ba4,b'rnbqk2r/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',that has forced that all to powerful bishop back where it belongs (somewhere useless)
50,1,15,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',i take the oppurtunity to play rook out

52,1,17,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',now i am in the hope of getting that queen which could mean trouble for white unless it does something about it soon!
53,1,18,1Be3,b'rnbqr1k1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',ah- he blocks!
54,1,19,1Bc5,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/2bp4/B7/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',but that wasn't that good a move after all
55,1,20,1O-O,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/2bp4/B7/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',that is one of the possible ways to escape the pin that is possible
56,1,21,1d4,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/2b5/B2p4/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',but that still doesn't prevent me playing that 
57,1,22,1Nxd4,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/2b5/B2N4/2NPB3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',but i wasn't to forget that though i still come out better from that swap off
58,1,23,1Bxd4,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/8/B2b4/2NPB3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',what else could you expect there?
59,1,24,1Qf3,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/8/B2b4/2NPBQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',now he is after my pawns!
60,1,25,1Bg4,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/8/B2b2b1/2NPBQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',but it is my oppurtunity make use of more pieces and get into the attack!
61,1,26,1Qf4,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/8/B2b1Qb1/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',that has atleast got the queen from threatening my pawn as it was previously
62,1,27,1Be5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/4b3/B4Qb1/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',but i desperately want that queen 
63,1,28,1Qc4,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/4b3/B1Q3b1/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',okay- he still wants the pawn!
64,1,29,1b5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/1p2b3/B1Q3b1/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',but that was a total mistake- i love pushing pawns!
65,1,30,1Nxb5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/1N2b3/B1Q3b1/3PB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',a decent move
66,1,31,1cxb5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/5n2/1p2b3/B1Q3b1/3PB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',but i'm now further in the lead
67,1,32,1Bxb5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/5n2/1B2b3/2Q3b1/3PB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',pressure on my rook now
68,1,33,1Nbd7,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/1B2b3/2Q3b1/3PB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',lets play more defensive now and take the oppurtunity to play that knight out
69,1,34,1Bg5,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/1B2b1B1/2Q3b1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',going for a mighty pin which could disrupt my position!
70,1,35,1Be6,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/4bn2/1B2b1B1/2Q5/3P4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',but i'm in serious need of that queen to be thrashing my oponent properly!

73,1,38,2Bxc4,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/4b1B1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',atleast i got what i wanted though i lost my rather altruistic bishop
74,1,39,2Bxb2,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/3P4/PbP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',now i'm after those rooks
75,1,40,2Rab1,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/3P4/PbP2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',but white won't have it!
76,1,41,2Bc3,b'r2qr1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/2bP4/P1P2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',double attack on that rook!

80,1,45,2Rb8,b'1r2q1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/2bP4/P1P2PPP/1R3K2 w - -',but i want the other rook as well
81,1,46,2Rb3,b'1r2q1k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/1RbP4/P1P2PPP/5K2 b - -',why ever would white play that
82,1,47,2Qe1#,b'1r4k1/p2n1ppp/5n2/6B1/2B5/1RbP4/P1P2PPP/4qK2 w - -',the inevitable and on white's part rather unsuspected CHECKMATE! Yay for me!
83,2,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The Reti opening may not be the most brilliant opening of all but it is a great surprise opening.
84,2,1,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I believe d4 is the more aggressive line leading to the Kings Indian Attack which many GM's have scored impressive victorys with.
85,2,2,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',I opted to choose a more aggressive line. He could've played c4 to emphasise the h1-a8 diagonal.
86,2,3,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/8/2PP1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',6.c3 made me wonder. I didn't know what his plan was.

91,2,8,O-O,b'1r3rk1/1pqb1pp1/p1nbpn1p/2pp4/4P3/1PPP1NP1/PBQN1PBP/4RRK1 w - -',Is c4 strong here? It prepares for a fork and strikes the centre thus being the most logical move. ( Correct me if i'm wrong)
92,2,9,1a3,b'1r3rk1/1pqb1pp1/p1nbpn1p/2pp4/4P3/PPPP1NP1/1BQN1PBP/4RRK1 b - -',Weird move. What's the purpose.

99,2,16,3Rd8,b'3r2k1/1p4p1/p4p1p/2R5/P1P1r3/BP4P1/7P/7K w - -',More accurate and crushing is 31.Ba3 Re2 32. RESIGNS!

103,2,20,6Rg1,b'8/7R/8/5k2/7p/7K/8/6r1 w - -',So i just make a random move and offer draw which he accepts. I missed so many opportunity's making this game somewhat interesting.
104,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',At this point (looking at my opponents grade in comparison to mine) i was confident of a loss but i still took the challenge!
105,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',quite common- though i don't remember what this opening is called

168,5,4,Bxc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pppnpppp/8/8/2bPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Possibly not the best move from black as I can now develop with tempo and black loses his most oactive piece

187,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is a move that it is quite often countered with.
188,6,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I then bring my knight out.

In my short time playing this opening it seems like White's intention is to get into a position similar to this and play d4. Although under-developed on the queen-side White has a strong pawn structure and a lot of pieces are aimed towards Black's king-side.

The bishop because vulnerable from either d5 or e5 and now I'm going to get doubled pawns on the e-file. I've just assisted Black in taking the centre.

I've given up any attempt to save the pawns because I felt the e3 pawn was safe for now. I was going to respond to Qh4 with 18. N2d4 and felt I'd mobilised my knights better. My opponent and I exchanged chat during the game in which she admitted that she wanted to thought about playing 17... Bxg2. GK analysis shows up Qg5 which would have been utterly devastating for myself as White especially against someone rated over 300 points more.

Nf5... and White wins. Sorry it is long but most of that is forced. If Black chooses to play 21... Kf7/Kf8 White follows with 22.

It goes something like 22... Qf6 23. exf6 Nxd2 24. Ne6+ Rxe6 25. Qxe6... I think Black has to take the pawn because of the mate threat which allows White to effectively finish the game with Bg8.

I have played her several times before and have played passive at times and 18. Bxh7+ showed that I was quite willing to take a draw against my higher-rated opponent. Qf6 forces me to play on and press forth with my advantage... while if I miss my mate in 3 combination gives me a chance to take the perpetual check option for a draw (Queen checking between e6 and f5).

The central pawn phalanx could be very threatening indeed in the end game and so black has every reason to be optimistic.

but note the unprotected e-pawn ...which I very unwisely do not pay proper attention to (and which is perhaps not very significant in the current position).  [note: might have played 18. Bc1].

at any rate I am quite focused on the d-file and on d3 in particular.  I see that black could add a fourth attacker with Ba6 ...pinning the pawn if my R on f stays where it is.

Now I have the ability to get rid of one of these attackers the N on e5 with a piece that is not involved in defending d3.  

I do not love the idea of this exchange but feel that removing that N may be worth the negatives that come with it.  

HOWEVER I am so focused on the pressure on d3 (thinking the black Queen will stay on the d-file) that I do not recognize the potential fork (of two pawns by Q).  I incorrectly assume he would recapture with bishop.

So I should have tossed the idea of BxN and found something better.

I also attack his knight and put a little but of pressure on the f7 pawn
585,23,8,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3np3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',He covered both

I have 2 options now..take with my bishop or take with my knight if I take it with my bishop I put pressure on the e5 pawn however as I thought about this this would just give him reason and opportunity to get his other knight into play so I did not want to do that
597,23,20,1Nxc3,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/2p1b3/1p1npp2/8/PBNP1Q2/1PPB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This way I also open up the e file and have 2 unused rooks that can attack it

Normally he could of moved his knight to protect it but that would mean he would blokc his queen from protecting the d5 knight and I had a lot of firepower aiming at that spot
600,23,23,1Qd6,b'rn3rk1/6pp/2pqb3/pp1npp2/8/PBNP1Q2/1PPB1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So instead he moves his queen forward.  This was not a bad move put his queen more into play gave more room for his rooks etc.  I was also starting to feel the pressure of the pawns and all of his pieces at this point...
601,23,24,1Nxd5,b'rn3rk1/6pp/2pqb3/pp1Npp2/8/PB1P1Q2/1PPB1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',So I decided to give myself some more breathing room and more importantly I got a bishop pair knowing that his pawn defence around his king was weak I thought I might in the far future be able to exploit it
602,23,25,1cxd5,b'rn3rk1/6pp/3qb3/pp1ppp2/8/PB1P1Q2/1PPB1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',He could of also take it with the bishop but I think he now like that his bishop was protecting a lot of pawns in the middle of the board.. quite powerful..  NOW... this is the move I thought about for 2 days (obviously off and on) and I decided to sacrifice my rook by taking the e5 pawn the reasoning behind this was that I could then move my a1 rook which was doing jack squat and attack his queen
603,23,26,1Rxe5,b'rn3rk1/6pp/3qb3/pp1pRp2/8/PB1P1Q2/1PPB1PPP/R5K1 b - -',Once I did this the he took it

605,23,28,1Re1,b'rn3rk1/6pp/4b3/pp1pqp2/8/PB1P1Q2/1PPB1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',and now although he could move back and protect his bishop again I could that take his bishop anyways with my rook and if he took my rook then I could take the d5 pawn with my bishop and trap his queen behind the king.. and he woudl lose the king.  Now.. my opponent saw this and could of taken my rook (so in the end by the numbers it would have been an even trade.. however... I knew I had the bishop pair and a queen and with his king exposed like that even if he did this.. I think I could pull of the win.. so in the end he decided to instead take my weak pawn on b2

613,23,36,2Bf4,b'1n3r1k/6pp/4Q3/pp3p2/5B2/qB1P2P1/2P2P1P/6K1 b - -',Now this was a very important move at this point I know that his bishop cant move much cause If it take him its mate by moving my bishop here I can attack the queen and rook at the same time next move and also put some pressure on the knight (which isnt that important but a good distraction nonethelss)
614,23,37,2Qc5,b'1n3r1k/6pp/4Q3/ppq2p2/5B2/1B1P2P1/2P2P1P/6K1 w - -',He realizes that he NEEDS to get his queen back into the action other wise I could eventually move my queen to f7 forcing his rook to c8 and then I could play by bishop to e5 whcih would results in checkmate

That's why I was willing to trade mine off. But I didn't expect him to open up his kingside and give himself double isolated pawns.

I can only only put it down to my lack of nutrience causing a momentary lapse in concentration that I played this. this is pretty much what lost it although much more difficult things just got alot more complicated. though black can olny play to hang on and white can play for the win. The logical Rh6 would have been fine. then after say Rh3 black simply plays Bg7 then if white tries to swicth to the f file Bf6 and white cannot break through. as long as black has both pawns blocked things are fine.



there are many ways for white to win from this point. He could try f6 for one. 54.f6 Rh8 55.Rf1 Rxf6 56.Rxf6+ Bxf6 57.h6! Ke6 (only way to cover both f5 and d5) 58.Bf5+ (or even h7 first and then follow up with this line) Kd6 59.Bc8!which clears the f5 square for white. the black monarch can't cover both f5 and d5 because the LSB controls e5 now lets say black chasses after the bishop. ...Kc7 60.Ba6 and it's game over. the bishop can come to c4 and the king can break through the lines with the bishop tied down to the defence of h8 he wont have enough man power to stop white wreaking havock on the position.  


Of course white chooses a more effiecnt way to win.

So where can I move my pieces so that I will have an advantage after my queen is captured. Maybe knight to c3 is a good move checking his king? but then xc3  Qxc3..and so on which might have been what some of you would have done. but I chose the following moves.

1113,39,78,4Kb3,b'7k/8/p2p1p2/1p2p3/4P2P/PK6/n3rN2/3R1R2 b - -',after this I notice that his king is unable to move. I am also unable to move my major pieces. I notice if I can get the king in check in this situation I will win the game. 
1114,39,79,4a5,b'7k/8/3p1p2/pp2p3/4P2P/PK6/n3rN2/3R1R2 w - -',So I slowly begin to move my A file pawn to check his king.
1115,39,80,4Rxd6,b'7k/8/3R1p2/pp2p3/4P2P/PK6/n3rN2/5R2 b - -',I don't know who wouldv'e won if he didn't make this bad move but instead of moving his rook to d4 saving his king. It looks like he didn't notice that his king was stuck and I think he was going for my king but nevertheless this is a game losing move.
