0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',By creating this I am hoping to learn some better moves from the veteren players and showing off a mediocre win against a player under 1000. It's been a while since I last played on gameknot....
1,0,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I don't like these openings. I am not comfortable with this opening. 
2,0,2,Qe2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',My method for chess at the moment is to try to get as many pieces as I can. This may not work so well in higher chess matches but it tends to work decently in the lower leagues. This move is an attempt to save my pawn if he chooses to take it. 
3,0,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',What is he trying to do here? Does he have a simular tactic as me? 
4,0,4,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I knew that the right side of my board was covered by a row of pawns...it would be hard to try to attack in that situation. 
5,0,5,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',This move eventually costed him dearly when he had the momentum. I assume he is trying to take out his bishop but I like the e4 move better. 
6,0,6,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',"I've seen this used many times and I thought I'd give it a try. This makes it hard for bishops (mostly) and other pieces to get close to the main part of my ""fleet"". "
7,0,7,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I saw this one coming. 
8,0,8,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/2NP3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',This was a multi purpose move. It prevented that bishop from ever coming near my rook and protected the pawn above the queen. 
9,0,9,d4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/3pP3/2NP3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Things went downhill from here. 
10,0,10,Na4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/N2pP3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I didn't think it would be wise to move my knight back to where it came from. The only other logical choice was here. Unfortunatly my lack of vision cost me. 
11,0,11,Qa5+,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q7/N2pP3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',I don't like falling behind with pieces in chess matches. This made me very upset at myself. 
12,0,12,c3,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q7/N2pP3/2PP3P/PP2QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',"Was this the right thing to do? I wanted to try to gain a pawn after losing a knight to try to make the ""score"" more even. But I'm not sure if I saw that bishop. "
13,0,13,Qxa4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/q2pP3/2PP3P/PP2QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Anticipated move. 
14,0,14,b3,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/q2pP3/1PPP3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I wanted to be on the offensive. I wanted vengence in the form of chess pieces...
15,0,15,Qa6,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/q1p3p1/8/3pP3/1PPP3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',An expected move. 
16,0,16,cxd4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/q1p3p1/8/3PP3/1P1P3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',As I said before I wanted to gain back some pieces to even our score. 
17,0,17,Bxd4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/3bP3/1P1P3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',This is where I actually started thinking. You see now that the bishop is not protected. If I move my bishop to the spot diagnal to the rook I could scare it off and take down the rook. That would easily make up the loss. 
18,0,18,1Bb2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/3bP3/1P1P3P/PB2QPP1/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Done.

20,0,20,1Qxb2,b'rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/4P3/1P1P3P/PQ3PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Only logical move that I can see in the situation.
21,0,21,1b5,b'rnb1k1nr/p3pp1p/q1p3p1/1p6/4P3/1P1P3P/PQ3PP1/R3KBNR w KQkq b6',I don't understand this. He appeared to have seen my tactic before but now he seems oblivous to the fact I can still take it down. Perhaps he didn't see my move before or wasn't paying attention this time around? 
22,0,22,1Qxh8,b'rnb1k1nQ/p3pp1p/q1p3p1/1p6/4P3/1P1P3P/P4PP1/R3KBNR b KQq -',I clap my hands. 
23,0,23,1Kf8,b'rnb2knQ/p3pp1p/q1p3p1/1p6/4P3/1P1P3P/P4PP1/R3KBNR w KQ -',A good move in the circumstance. That knight is saved. 
24,0,24,1Qxh7,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/q1p3p1/1p6/4P3/1P1P3P/P4PP1/R3KBNR b KQ -',I am a player for pieces. Pawns count too. 
25,0,25,1c5,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/q5p1/1pp5/4P3/1P1P3P/P4PP1/R3KBNR w KQ -',Is it a good time to develop after major blows have been struck? 
26,0,26,1Nf3,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/q5p1/1pp5/4P3/1P1P1N1P/P4PP1/R3KB1R b KQ -',It's a easy mate I'm trying to build up to as the knight will support the queen in checkmate. I was fairly sure he would see it but he had been oblivious in the past. 
27,0,27,1Qf6,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/5qp1/1pp5/4P3/1P1P1N1P/P4PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',If I wasn't paying attention I may have had to take a taste of my own medicine. 
28,0,28,1e5,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/5qp1/1pp1P3/8/1P1P1N1P/P4PP1/R3KB1R b KQ -',The pawn stops the queens attack and further brings more pieces on my attack on the king. This pawn actually helped me get the mate.
29,0,29,1Qf5,b'rnb2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1pp1Pq2/8/1P1P1N1P/P4PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',Would you have moved here?

I needed something to protect the knight though. I liked this because I made him think I was castleing when in reality I was not. 
31,0,31,1Nc6,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/2n3p1/1pp1Pq2/8/1P1P1N1P/P3BPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',The pawn is safe as long as the queen is in trouble. 
32,0,32,1g4,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/2n3p1/1pp1Pq2/6P1/1P1P1N1P/P3BP2/R3K2R b KQ g3',My move I was planning for...
33,0,33,1Qf4,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/2n3p1/1pp1P3/5qP1/1P1P1N1P/P3BP2/R3K2R w KQ -',This is a tough spot. I have no pieces able to threaten the queen. 
34,0,34,1O-O,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/2n3p1/1pp1P3/5qP1/1P1P1N1P/P3BP2/R4RK1 b - -',Well well...I castled after all. My king is now much safer. 
35,0,35,1Nxe5,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1pp1n3/5qP1/1P1P1N1P/P3BP2/R4RK1 w - -',I did a poor job preparing for this. 
36,0,36,1Nxe5,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1pp1N3/5qP1/1P1P3P/P3BP2/R4RK1 b - -',I didn't want a knight helping the queen get a mate. He was too close. I had to destroy it. 
37,0,37,1Qxe5,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1pp1q3/6P1/1P1P3P/P3BP2/R4RK1 w - -',I think this was easy to predict. 
38,0,38,2Rae1,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1pp1q3/6P1/1P1P3P/P3BP2/4RRK1 b - -',I could use my strategy from earlier in the game and take another rook. 
39,0,39,2Qd5,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1ppq4/6P1/1P1P3P/P3BP2/4RRK1 w - -',He sees it. He finally learned his lesson. But I would have moved that bishop instead. That queen situated in front of a rook is not a good idea. 
40,0,40,2f4,b'r1b2kn1/p3pp1Q/6p1/1ppq4/5PP1/1P1P3P/P3B3/4RRK1 b - f3',All I need to do is move the bishop (with the rook protecting) and I've got a rook. 
41,0,41,2e6,b'r1b2kn1/p4p1Q/4p1p1/1ppq4/5PP1/1P1P3P/P3B3/4RRK1 w - -',He is defending his queen. Why would he do this? Why would his queen need protection? 
42,0,42,2Bf3,b'r1b2kn1/p4p1Q/4p1p1/1ppq4/5PP1/1P1P1B1P/P7/4RRK1 b - -',I have him again. I've used this tactic many times throughout the game sometimes failing and other times succeeding. My opponent is very inconsistent.
43,0,43,2Qxd3,b'r1b2kn1/p4p1Q/4p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P1q1B1P/P7/4RRK1 w - -',He made the best decision given the time. A pawn is a gain. 
44,0,44,2Bxa8,b'B1b2kn1/p4p1Q/4p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P1q3P/P7/4RRK1 b - -',Success. 
45,0,45,2Ba6,b'B4kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P1q3P/P7/4RRK1 w - -',I assume he wants to move the pawn diagnal the bishop move the queen put my king in check and take the rook. When one uses a move very often they aren't likely to be fooled by it. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me especially at this stage. 
46,0,46,2Red1,b'B4kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P1q3P/P7/3R1RK1 b - -',I'm not scared of the queen putting me in check if it moves directly vertical to the king.. All I need to do is move one space to the right and the bishop (at the other side of the board) will support my position. Too bad black was too late to move his pawn out of the way for his bishop to take my rook. And look! I can get his king in check once the queen moves out of the way! 
47,0,47,2Qe3+,b'B4kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P2q2P/P7/3R1RK1 w - -',The expected check. 
48,0,48,2Rf2,b'B4kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/1pp5/5PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/3R2K1 b - -',This was the form of check I was not expecting. I suppose I should have been more prepared for this move. This puts the rook out of the black bishop's danger. 
49,0,49,2b4,b'B4kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/2p5/1p3PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/3R2K1 w - -',Too bad he is too late to make a legitamite attack on my bishop. At the very least it gives black's queen some support. 
50,0,50,2Rd8+,b'B2R1kn1/p4p1Q/b3p1p1/2p5/1p3PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/6K1 b - -',I smell a checkmate. 
51,0,51,2Ke7,b'B2R2n1/p3kp1Q/b3p1p1/2p5/1p3PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/6K1 w - -',I thought this over a bit and the best move was to take the knight. 
52,0,52,2Qxg8,b'B2R2Q1/p3kp2/b3p1p1/2p5/1p3PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/6K1 b - -',By doing this the rook is protected and I've taken down yet another value piece. 
53,0,53,2Kf6,b'B2R2Q1/p4p2/b3pkp1/2p5/1p3PP1/1P2q2P/P4R2/6K1 w - -',Thinking back on it was this the correct time to move his king or should he try attempt a last chance attempt on my king? 
54,0,54,2g5+,b'B2R2Q1/p4p2/b3pkp1/2p3P1/1p3P2/1P2q2P/P4R2/6K1 b - -',Do you not remember the pawn I talked about? It forms support for the other pawn to strike. And the king can only move to two spaces...both checkmate.

a) castle queenside and attack black’s king by means of a pawn-storm
b) make use of the central pawn majority with Bd3 Qc2 and Nge2
c) make a minority attack by the advance of the b pawn hoping to create weaknesses in black's queen side

Black on the other side has some counter-play in form of a minority attack on king side with the pawn push f5-f4 or exploit white weaknesses on c4 and e4

It has been a while since I have annotated a game.  I have been writing up some memoirs of my friendship with a lady called Rita who died of breast cancer last year.  I am now putting the finishing touches on the memoirs so hopefully I will be able to. a. Get some closure from the death although I will never forget about her b. Move faster c. annotate more games.  Anyhow here I am up against an IM called Hexs (Hector).  After 1. e4 he responded with e6 which is the French Defense.  Gameknot analysis is provided here:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16540036&rnd=0.7359081799218419.  Just 3 innaccuracies from myself proved decisive."

947,28,21,2Rc3,b'1k5r/p1p5/1p6/5ppp/1P6/P1R3P1/r4PKP/4R3 b - -',For the moment I have defended.  Hallelujah!
948,28,22,2h4,b'1k5r/p1p5/1p6/5pp1/1P5p/P1R3P1/r4PKP/4R3 w - -',I think Rd8 Rd2 was a better plan.  Not that I saw this at the time. I struggled over what to do here and decided there was no immediate threat in an open h file.
949,28,23,Rf8,b'1k3r2/p1p5/1p6/4Rpp1/1P6/P1R3P1/r4PK1/8 w - -',I spend some precious seconds here trying to figure out what was sound.
950,28,24,2Rf3,b'1k3r2/p1p5/1p6/4Rpp1/1P6/P4RP1/r4PK1/8 b - -',This worked in blitz.  Is it sound?
951,28,25,2g4,b'1k3r2/p1p5/1p6/4Rp2/1P4p1/P4RP1/r4PK1/8 w - -',Trades rooks and pawns but then allows me to regain the pawn I lost earlier. 
952,28,26,3Rf4,b'1k6/p1p5/1p6/8/1P3Rp1/r5P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Black cannot defend while I can take and defend simultaneously.
953,28,27,a5,b'1k6/2p5/1p6/p7/rP4R1/6P1/5PK1/8 w - a6',A mistake.  Of course I cannot take but I can give check and then take.  Black had to play Kb7 here then I would have had no way to save my pawn.
954,28,28,bxa5,b'6R1/1kp5/8/p7/r7/6P1/5PK1/8 w - -',Even on material I had about 1:05 left to black's :50.  I still thought I would lose and planned only to play quickly and try to keep the time advantage.
955,28,29,3Rg6,b'8/1kp5/6R1/p7/r7/6P1/5PK1/8 b - -',Aimed only at keeping the black king from advancing which of course does not work--36...c6 gives him cover--but here dahnoos let 25 seconds go by and then resigned perhaps having overestimated my competence in the endgame or simply having lost interest.  Anyway thanks to dahnoos for the game and feel free to comment.
956,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The game was long and hard it started at 8:00pm and didn't finish untill 12:30am! 4 and a half hours finishing after midnight. It was a very hard fought game. The game was quite unusual from start to finish where I went with some odd looking lines coming from the GPA. it seemed that I was looking at a good position when suddenly my opponent found a nice defence and it looked like I was destined to be slaughtered as I probably should have been in the position. How ever with some mistakes from my opponent I managed to get into a rook pawn end game where a nice little move seems to have secured the draw!
957,29,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Of course the best reply for black is meant to be the tal gambit which is 2...d5 I knew however that my opponent wasn't likely to know this.
958,29,2,Bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1B5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',retreating the bishop to a4 would get it trapped and moving it back would be a waste of tempo. 
959,29,3,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1p5/2ppP3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I'm not sure if this is right I know it's not often a move done in the GPA however it felt right in the position.
960,29,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I suspect this may have been an inaccuracy as d3 would prevent black from pushing his c pawn.
961,29,5,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/4bppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Luckily my opponent didn't play c4.
962,29,6,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1p1p2n/2ppP3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I spent a bit of time here trying to work out weather I should do this or not. I had wanted to actually not castle at all and instead go for some aggresive pawn thrusts however I couldn't get around black playing Bh4+ 
963,29,7,1Ne1,b'r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1p1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQNRK1 b kq -',?! a rather dubious move. It was meant to be a rook lift however I suspect it is a little early for that.
964,29,8,1b3,b'r1bqk2r/4bpp1/p1p1p3/2ppPn1p/5P2/1PNP4/P1P3PP/R1BQNRK1 b kq -',And making my last move look even more silly I change plan straight away. This move intends to make a target out of the c5 pawn. Black can't save it if I play Na4 and Ba3. Well not without using either his rook or bishop.
965,29,9,1Rf3,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/b1p1p3/p1ppPn1p/N4P2/1P1P1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 b kq -',I can't play Ba3 yet because of the fork at e3. 
966,29,10,1Bb5,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/2p1p3/pbppPn1p/N4P2/1P1P1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 w kq -',Unfortunalty it also means I dont have the time to make my attack on the pawn.
967,29,11,Qb6,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppPn1p/5P2/1PNP1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 w kq -',Prepares a discovered check.

969,29,13,1g4,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppPn2/5PPp/1PNP3R/P1P4P/R1BQN1K1 b kq g3',of course black cannot take e.p because of the pin on his h8 rook. 
970,29,14,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1PNP3R/P1P4P/R1BQN1K1 w kq -',? I really think this move was a mistke. as now the knight is effectvly trapped in the middle of the board. I'm not sure what I would have done if black had played 16...Nh6. It has already been a messy sort of game. 
971,29,15,1Be3,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1PNPB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 b kq -',stops him pushing is c pawn if it were on his mind as well as targets the c pawn.
972,29,16,1Ba6,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/bqp1p3/p1ppP3/3n1PPp/1PNPB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 w kq -',making an escape route for his knight since Nb1 c3 would trap it.
973,29,17,1Na4,b'r3k2r/4bpp1/bqp1p3/p1ppP3/N2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 b kq -',I very much wanted to play a4 here covering the knights only escpe square however I couldn't see a way around the fact that if I got my knight out of the way the c3 would be useless on account of Nxb3 forking queen and rook. So I went with this which is still a very good move It was here or the last move where I worked out I could win atleast a pawn.
974,29,18,2Nb2,b'r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1P1PB2R/PNPQ3P/R3N1K1 b kq -',! I thought this would win the knight however my opponent after quite a bit of thinking came up with a soloution.
975,29,19,2a4,b'r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/1bppP3/p2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/PNPQ3P/R3N1K1 w kq -',! now I can no longer win a piece. however I can easily win a pawn if I choose. But this is I think still the best move in this position.
976,29,20,2cxd4,b'r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/1bppP3/3P1PPp/1p1PB2R/PN1Q3P/R3N1K1 b kq -',"? A mistake or probably this deserves a ?? since black gets three pawns for the piece but more importantly a monster protected passed pawn on the 7th rank! my thinking was that I could take the piece then snaffle a coulpe of other pawns I thought that I would have enough on the a pawn to keep it under raps. Which was very wrong and probably should have lost me the game!

The simple 22.a3! Nc2 23.Nxc2 bxc2 23.Qxc2 would have left me a pawn up with a comfortable position."
977,29,21,2Nc2,b'r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/1b1pP3/3p1PPp/3P3R/pNNQ1B1P/R5K1 b kq -',Oly real option.
978,29,22,2g5,b'r3k2r/q3bpp1/4p3/1bppP1P1/3p1P1p/3P3R/pNNQ1B1P/R5K1 b kq -',!? I should be assigning my resources to the taming of the passed pawn rather than going after irrelevant pawns on the other side of the board. I rationalised to myself that since black woldn't want to trade rooks on the h file my rook would have enough time to reactivate my.
979,29,23,2Kd7,b'r6r/q2kbpp1/4p3/1bppP1P1/3p1P1p/3P3R/pNNQ1B1P/R5K1 w - -',I was rather hoping my opponent would castle instead giving me counterplay on the h file.
980,29,24,2Rc1,b'rr6/q2kbpp1/4p3/1bppP1P1/3p1P1R/3P4/pNNQ1B1P/2R3K1 b - -',Perhaps Rh3 would have been better.
981,29,25,2Qxa5,b'rr6/3kbpp1/4p3/QbppP1P1/3p1P1R/3P4/pNN2B1P/2R3K1 b - -',?! another bad move I thought that by trading heavy pieces I was taking away blacks resources to utalise the pawn this is of course false.
982,29,26,3Na1,b'1r6/r2kbpp1/4p3/1bppP1P1/3p1P1R/3P4/pN5P/N1R1B1K1 b - -',I also spent time considering if Rh3 was worth playing.
983,29,27,Bxd3,b'1r6/r2kbpp1/4p3/2ppP1P1/3p1P1R/3b4/pNR4P/N3B1K1 w - -',Beter than if this had been played last move. Now black gets one extra tempo.
984,29,28,3Nxd3,b'1r6/r2kbpp1/4p3/2ppP1P1/3p1P1R/3N4/p1R4P/N3B1K1 b - -',I also wondered if Rd2 would have worked.
985,29,29,c4,b'8/r2kbpp1/4p3/3pP1P1/2pp1P1R/3N4/p6P/NrR1B1K1 w - -',so black gets his piece back.
986,29,30,Ba3,b'8/r2k1pp1/4p3/3pP1P1/2pp1P1R/b2N4/p2B3P/NrR3K1 w - -',I thought I was about to lose here. as I could see no way to prevent Bb2

989,29,33,3Rxa1,b'8/1r1k1pp1/4p3/3pP1P1/3p1P2/b2R4/p2B3P/r3R1K1 w - -',? but black makes a mistake! giving me the chance to get back into the game.
990,29,34,3Kf2,b'8/3k1pp1/4p3/3pP1P1/3p1P2/R7/p2B1K1P/rr2R3 b - -',! now I allowed myself to think I might not die so suddenly after all. although I am techically up in material the pawn still posses a danger to me.
991,29,35,3Kc6,b'8/5pp1/2k1p3/3pP1P1/3p1P2/R7/p2B1K1P/rr2R3 w - -',I put in some thought here and decided my best option was to exchange my bishop for blacks pawn and hope the insuing ending might be a draw. maybe instead h4 worked? 
992,29,36,4Rxa2,b'8/5pp1/2k1p3/3pP1P1/3p1P2/8/R4K1P/2r5 b - -',Now I it's pretty clear that black is much better. I however had hopes of putting up a fight. Is the position enough to win? well lets see how things progressed then make a descision at that point.
993,29,37,Rf1,b'8/5pp1/4p3/3pP1P1/2kp1P2/8/R2K3P/5r2 w - -',I had actually thought black would have played Rh2 at the time I thought that Rf1 was actually quite clever but I can't remeber why I thought that now probably because this threatens both the f apwn and the same threats that Rh2 would have had. which is better Rf1 or Rh1 what does the reader think? either way my next two moves would likely be the same.
994,29,38,Kc5,b'8/5pp1/4p3/2kpP1P1/R2p1P2/8/3K3P/5r2 w - -',I actually wonder if Kb3!? was worth a look.
995,29,39,4g6,b'8/5pp1/4p1P1/2kpP3/R2p1P2/8/3K3P/5r2 b - -',! this was the key move to the endgame In think. I suspect and I could be very wrong but I believe that this move I was happy with in the game is what gives me good drawing chances. I needed to break up blacks pawns and this forces that. even now I am somewhat proud of this move as it's something of a positional sacrafice which is not something I manage to do often.
996,29,40,4fxg6,b'8/6p1/4p1p1/2kpP3/R2p1P2/8/3K3P/5r2 w - -',In the game this is what I expected but I think Rxf4 would have been more acurate. either way I suspect both cases the game should be a draw with good defence from white.
997,29,41,5e7+,b'8/4P1p1/3k2R1/3p4/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',! This forces blacks hand and allows me to set up my fortress in which black will find it very difficult. Keep in mind it was getting quite late at this point and as the game goes on we were both getting tired and my opponent was very low on time he came down to seconds a few times only being saved by the 30 second increment.
998,29,42,5Rh7,b'8/7R/3k4/3p4/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',! An important move 
999,29,43,Kd6,b'8/8/3k4/3p3R/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 w - -',so now black can't go back down that path lest it be a draw by reppition.
1000,29,44,5Rh7,b'8/7R/3k4/3p4/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',technically Rh8 would be more accurate but I wanted to repeat the position as much as possible and this move still holds fort.
1001,29,45,Kc5,b'8/7R/8/2kp4/3pr3/3K4/8/8 w - -',"This will get black nowhere. As I can bring my rook to c7 and should black move his king to the queenside then a draw would result since I could create an unpassable ""fence"" where the black king cannot cross. and without the support of the king the pawns/rook combo would not be able to pomote since my rook would have plenty of waiting moves at it's disposal."
1002,29,46,6Rh4,b'8/8/8/3pkr2/3p3R/3K4/8/8 b - -',This is to stop the king crossing the fourth rank should my king be forced back.
1003,29,47,6Rh8,b'7R/8/8/3pk3/3p1r2/8/3K4/8 b - -',This rook move once agains keeps my fortress intact since it allows me to play Re8+ before black can free the d4 square for his king.
1004,29,48,6Ke2,b'7R/8/8/3pk3/3p4/5r2/4K3/8 b - -',This time I have to push the rook to stop the king coming into e4.
1005,29,49,6Re3+,b'7R/8/8/3pk3/3p4/4r3/4K3/8 w - -',I think that Rg3 was actually the correct move. I'm not sure if a draw would still be the case after 69...Rg3 70.Re8+
1006,29,50,Ke4,b'7R/8/8/3p4/3pk3/4r3/3K4/8 w - -',Now this situation looks familier!
1007,29,51,7Rh5+,b'8/8/8/3pk2R/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',At this stage it was basically 12:30 at night and we were the only two left in the club meeting room. My opponent was short on time and I was playing for a draw. With this move I pointed out to my opponent that the position had reppeated itself three times with the same person to move and all. My opponent disagreed and we came to the descision that we would play it out and if it didn't end up as a draw then we would set up the position again and see if it was a three fold reppition. And I can say it definatly was.
1008,29,52,7Rh7,b'8/7R/3k4/3p4/3p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',This position has also reppeated itself three times.
1009,29,53,7Rc8,b'2R5/8/8/3p4/1k1p4/4r3/3K4/8 b - -',a waiting move now that black has cut off contcact between his king and the rest of his army I think a draw is secured.
1010,29,54,7Rb5,b'8/8/8/1R1p4/3p4/k1r5/3K4/8 b - -',My opponent agreed to a draw at this point. This was a very long tough battle and I am very happy with the way I played in the endgame inpaticular I think it is a very educational endgame and I think I played it basically correctly. Please tell me if I am mistaken on this count since I dont want to find out my enthusiasim is mispalced.
1011,30,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The first two moves are obvious because they are commonly played.
1012,30,1,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This starts as my opponent's gameplan is to be turned into a knightmare (get it?).
