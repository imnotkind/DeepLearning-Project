White (I) should have taken the chance to develop with tempo with BxNa6. This just to make possible o-o the beginning of the freedom. Now the N will become a killer monster! Can you see?

473,12,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My bread and butter. Because of a forfeit in our team I had the white pieces for once. The elo difference between the opponent's board 3 and 4 player was about 10 elo points so in other words they're more or less the same strenght. The difference between both boards is of course the colour I play with. I wasn't sure before the game started whether or not the forfeit would affect anything turns out it didn't and thus I was destined to play with the black pieces... until they threw me for a loop hole and suddenly I was playing with the white pieces. Apparently my teamcaptain registered me as the third board player. I complain a lot about my chess club but them setting me up with the white pieces was really good thinking of our chess captain.  Kudos to him.
474,12,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't dislike it it's a little bit more flexible then d5.  That being said it allows white to decide the way the game will go from here. White can play e4 which could get met with d5 and we'd be playing a french opening. Whatever I wish to play d5 will be played sooner rather then later that much I'm confident of.
475,12,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I decide to play a sort of waiting move. c4 or e4 were good if not better alternatives however they give black the choice on how he wants to fight those openings. I'll allow him to get some play in first see what he wants to do and go from there. Most likely I'll go into a queens gambit though which is the opening I play in nearly all my games as white.
476,12,3,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',This opening is called the queen gambit. A versatile opening which immediatly questions the center and allows for solid development.
477,12,4,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The queen gambit accepted. I'll be honest here I wasn't expecting this. The queen gambit is a gambit which most people just refute since the queen gambit declined lines allow a variaty of solid positions for black. The QGA at the other hand sometimes leads to wild tactical battles the reverse of the QGD.
478,12,5,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I could play e3 immediatly or Qa4+ if I really cared that much about the pawn. That being said theory shows that the pawn on c4 is really difficult to hang on to if white plays it correctly. I don't think I'm amazing at chess but I'd say I'm good enough to win back the pawn at a later occasion.
479,12,6,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',e4 is a choice of preference. I used to play e3 which is a different variation on itself but found to have more succes with e4. It's slightly more dangerous but quickly seizes the initiative. Plant a knight on e5 recapture the lost pawn with the bishop and all kind of sacrifices come to mind. The usual response of black here is either Bb4 or c5. I'm not 100% certain but I think c5 is better. After that the QGA gets divided into 2 sidelines. The one where white captures on c5 or the one where black captures on d4.
480,12,7,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/8/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I don't really like this move. Yes it stops Bg5 however black can always play Be7 defending the knight and then later on chase away the bishop. The fact that c5 or Bb4 wasn't played indicate that my opponent isn't too familiar with this opening.
481,12,8,Bf4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/8/2pPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I decide to play my bishop on f4 instead targeting the rather weak c7 pawn. Be3 was also a possiblity but this feels sligtly stronger. I'm not too scared of g5 since it completely destroys his king side pawn structure.

It makes it so that his bishop can't really go anywhere aside from Be7 which isn't a lot to be scared of. Bb4 and Bc5 aren't an option and Bd3 gets met with e5 forking the knight and the bishop.

I start calculating Nd5 ideas but quickly find that it's not worth it. It took me about 15 minutes to  even realize that e4 was being targeted by the bishop and that ideas like 12. h3 b4 13. axb4 Bb4 are rather annoying since the knight on c3 is the only defending piece of e4. My other knight can't help out either since it'd give away the pawn on d4.

If I showed this game to my fellow chess players/tutors they would refuse to believe I was the one playing this game just because of the developing aspect. That being said it's time to punish him a bit now that e4 is taken care of.

But believe it or not but this move is recommended by the computer for reasons I don't understand just yet. The computer probably says this is correct because after 13 moves black somehow equalizes but we're not magnus carlsen playing 13 moves correctly is far too much of a stretch at this elo. I guess he didn't want to risk losing it but it takes both his knight and bishop out of the game. The next few moves will take me a very long time since I was determined to reach a won position before he was able to relocate his pieces.

It's probably not the best move but it was played to prevent him castling. If he castles I'd sacrifice my bishop get my knight involved maybe sacrifice the knight as well involve my white bishop etc. It'd be a lot of calculations but in the variations that I ran in my head it was game over for black. Either way the entire sequence would most likely be forced. I'm pretty sure black has a way out of it but I'd calculate that way before I even attempted a sacrifice of course.
494,12,21,1Nh5,b'r2qk2r/nb2bpp1/p1p1p2p/1p5n/3PPB2/P1N2N2/BP1Q1PPP/2R1R1K1 w kq -',He took quite long to reach this move. I guess he was calculating what'd happen if he were to castle and didn't like what he found. Nh5 isn't too bad to be honest. My bishop is strong his knight isn't.
495,12,22,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/nb2bpp1/p1p1p2p/1p2N2n/3PPB2/P1N5/BP1Q1PPP/2R1R1K1 b kq -',I have my doubts about this move it's the type of move that looks good on paper but you get your doubts after it's played. The idea is simple. He takes my bishop I recapture and threaten mate in 1 he plays f6 and my knight becomes a monster knight on g6. That being said I missed that Bf6 is also a defence but it leads into a temporary knight sacrifice. He could also castle but that would get met with the same knight sacrifice.

My gut feeling says ignoring it is correct. Qc7 is good but it leads into 17. e5 Qc7 18. Bxe6+ Kxe6 19. exf6+ and black loses his queen. g5 just weakens the queenside and doesn't really solve it.

As you might have guessed end games are my weakness. I can't play 'em for the life of me so I have no idea wether or not this was a stupid decision or not.

513,12,40,Kxd6,b'2b1r3/n7/2pkp2p/pp6/3P1Pp1/P3R3/BP3K1P/3R4 w - -',Materialistically speaking I'm only slightly ahead. But the pawn on g4 is rather weak the pawn on e6 is a mess and his knight is having a summer holiday on Miami beach being non-existent and all. The score is +1 but positionally speaking this might even be something like +3. I'd check if I cared enough to download stockfish or something similar.
514,12,41,2Kg3,b'2b1r3/n7/2pkp2p/pp6/3P1Pp1/P3R1K1/BP5P/3R4 b - -',Targeting g4. Either he plays h5 or he drops his protection of the e6 pawn.

I spend about 15 minutes thinking out the entire endgame then end up making one of the few moves which loses. I feel like I deserve an award for that accomplishment. I feel like Rc5 just wins the entire game but I missed it.
524,12,51,Nxe5,b'2b5/2k5/7R/pp2nPr1/5K2/P7/BP5P/8 w - -',I wasn't worried just yet since I didn't realize he has a nasty check on f7 as well. I consider Be6 for a moment but it doesn't work. 
525,12,52,3Kxg5,b'2b5/2k5/7R/pp2nPK1/8/P7/BP5P/8 b - -',I think Kxe5 might have been better. I'm still 2 pawns up after all though he'd win back the pawn on f5 and promoting my h pawn would be terribly difficult. He'd put me in check about a kazillion times and somewhere along the lines I'd lose another pawn. 
526,12,53,Bxf5,b'8/2k5/7K/pp3b2/8/P7/BP5P/8 w - -',At this point I have to re-evaluate the position. From this point onwards I make about 1 more minor blunder namely failing to promote which I could have if I wasn't playing like a guy who was having a stroke. Back to the present I can see the path to promoting the pawn. If I can get my king on g7 my bishop on g6 and my pawn on h5 or h6 then it's my win. However making it that far takes time and I'm getting difficulty to calculate how much tempi he needs to promote versus how much I need. I opt to deal with the a and b pawn first then sprint back to my h-file. The endgame plan is to get my king on e3 holding back his king play my bishop to f7 and go from there.

I left with mixed feelings. I was euphoric that I played so well the first 20-30 moves but the fact that I threw away one of the easiest wins of my short chesscareer left a bitter aftertaste. At the very least it shows me that I need to work on my endurance and on endgames so that I prevent missing simple patterns. The season might be over but practicing isn't.

805,21,4,Na6,b'r5k1/p1bpr1pp/np2p1q1/1Np1P3/8/2P1RN2/PP3PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',Black finishes development and hopes apparently to attack on the Kingside.  But the N is hanging.
806,21,5,2Nd6,b'1b3rk1/p2pr1pp/Qp1Np1q1/2p1P3/8/2P1RN2/PP3PPP/R5K1 b - -',The N on d6 is a real annoyance for Black.  For one thing it prevents doubling the Rs on the f file.
807,21,6,2Qe2,b'1b3rk1/p2pr1pp/1p1Np3/2p1P3/8/2P1RN2/PPq1QPPP/R5K1 b - -',White offers to exchange and head toward an endgame with a piece to the good.
808,21,7,2exd6,b'5rk1/p2pr1pp/1p1Pp3/2p5/8/2P2N2/PP2RPPP/R5K1 b - -',By exchanging Black makes the material deficit loom larger.  Although Black has an open f file and two Rs it's not clear that an attack could be successful now.
809,21,8,h6,b'5rk1/p2p1rp1/1p1Pp2p/2p5/8/2P2N2/PP2RPPP/3R2K1 w - -',Thinking about a Kingside attack perhaps.  Rxf3 just loses the exchange.
810,21,9,2Ne5,b'5rk1/p2p1rp1/1p1Pp2p/2p1N3/8/2P5/PP2RPPP/3R2K1 b - -',Now White is also winning the d7 pawn making a dangerous passed pawn.
811,21,10,2Nc6,b'3r1k2/p2P4/1pN1p2p/2p2rp1/8/2P5/PP2RPPP/3R2K1 b - -',Black is going to lose significant material trying to deal with the passed pawn.
812,21,11,cxd4,b'3N1k2/p2P4/1p5p/6p1/3p4/8/PP2RPPP/6K1 w - -',With the R on the e file Black's K can't get to the passed pawn.
813,21,12,3d8=Q,b'3QR3/p5k1/1pN4p/6p1/8/3p4/PP3PPP/6K1 b - -',The pawn promotes in plenty of time to stop Black's d pawn.
814,21,13,3Qxd3,b'4R3/p5k1/1pN4p/8/6p1/3Q4/PP3PPP/6K1 b - -',Mate is going to follow in a few moves after White plays Re5 Qd6 Re7 Qd8.  White can safely ignore the Black pawns.

Also love how the computer loves attacking the centre because ...d5 starts showing up as an option.  It's a theme I need to watch for more often because I tend to favour positional play.  Presently I control 5 vs his 8.

If instead on 11. Bf1 I had played Kb1 then black could have played Nd-c5 with tempo first attacking my Bd3. After I see to that threat the final Nh3 is less strong as he can meet Nh3 with Bc8xh3. In the same way if I had retreated my bishop to c2 he could have played Nb6 with tempo as it attacks my pawn on c4 and again his Bc8 can capture on h3.

White would give up his best minor piece his dark squared bishop and black is ready to exploit the weak black squares. The position is so much easier to play for black. After 12. Bxf4 exf4 13.

934,24,48,2Qxc4+,b'2QQ4/p5kp/5npb/2p5/2q2P2/8/PP5P/2K2R2 w - -',He checks. There is only one square now which doesn't lose the rook with check.
935,24,49,3Kd2,b'2QQ4/p5kp/5npb/2p5/2q2P2/8/PP1K3P/5R2 b - -',So I played king to this square. The question is - what happens now after Bxf4+ - has he got a perpetual check or not? After the game with Luke we found ways out of the checks but looking at it later with David Thomas we were unable to find ways out. What do you think dear reader? Has anyone time to run this game through a computer and find out if white is winning in this position?
936,24,50,3Qb4+,b'2QQ4/p5kp/5npb/2p5/1q3P2/8/PP1K3P/5R2 w - -',Anyway he checked here instead.
937,24,51,3Kd1,b'2QQ4/p5kp/5npb/2p5/1q3P2/8/PP5P/3K1R2 b - -',And now he resigned as after Qa4 check b3 and he has run out of checks and I am threatening my own mate. Please rate this game on the star system and leave a comment or two. I hope you enjoyed this game!

1005,27,12,3f4,b'8/pp3k2/2p1n3/8/5PN1/4P2P/PP4P1/6K1 b - f3',Starting a massive King-side pawn storm.  For anyone who belittles the power of the pawn this ending can be educational.  
1006,27,13,3Ne5+,b'8/pp3k2/2p5/2n1N3/5P2/4P2P/PP4P1/6K1 b - -',The e5 square is an excellent base for the White knight because it can now support the pawn roller as it moves into the King-side corner.
1007,27,14,Ne4,b'8/pp6/2p1k3/4N3/4nPP1/4P2P/PP6/6K1 w - -',There are few choices for the Black knight.  It can only wait.  Any foray it makes into White's Queen-side leaves the Black king with no defense.
1008,27,15,Ne4,b'8/pp6/2p2k2/4N2P/4nPP1/4P3/PP4K1/8 w - -',The only choice here for Black is 36...Kg7 to slow the advancing h-pawn and look for a chance to blockade the pawn roller.  But these four connected passed pawns are a terror for Black in this game. 
1009,27,16,3g5+,b'8/pp6/2pn1k1P/4N1P1/5P2/4P3/PP4K1/8 b - -',Forcing the black king away from the square of the h-pawn.  Now nothing can stop its advance.

I think it helps holding the position although it requires one extra movement. But since black has already spent two pawn moves before it seems right.
1013,28,2,Nge7,b'r2qkb1r/1b2nppp/ppnpp3/2p5/2P1P3/2NPB1P1/PP2NPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black could have also attempted to develop a fianchetto but it may require too many moves. On the other hand centre is solid and there is no clear requirement to me for casting for either player.
1014,28,3,Nge7,b'r2qkb1r/1b2nppp/ppnpp3/2p5/2P1PP2/2NPB1P1/PP2N1BP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Wasted movements but it seems white didn´t take much advantage of it. A stronger response to aatack the right wing was required but didn´t see a clar approach to perform such attack.
1015,28,4,1a3,b'r2qkb1r/1b2nppp/ppnpp3/2p5/2P1PP2/P1NPB1P1/1P2N1BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',On the other hand keeping preassure on the left wing also seems right. Maybe 11.f5 was a better choice as said before; attacks the right wing and/or opens the centre.
1016,28,5,1bxc5,b'r1n1k2r/1b1qbppp/ppnpp3/2P5/N1P1PP2/P2PB1P1/4N1BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Not sure if I had to expose the flank so soon. Not a clear gain in prospect but time flyes.

Attacking white´s centre as a counterattack is a golden rule that he exploited very well. On the other hand pressure on his King´s defenses is high. I thought about giving up the centre and focus on attacking but without much results.
1019,28,8,1Qg4,b'r1nr2k1/1bq1bppp/ppn1p3/2p2P2/N1P1P1Q1/P1NPB1P1/6BP/1R3RK1 b - -',Unfortunately I didn´t see the 18...Ne5 that helps winning time .

1021,28,10,Nxd3,b'r1nr2k1/1bq1bppp/pp6/2p2R2/N1P1P3/P1NnB1PQ/6BP/1R4K1 w - -',Not sure if this is best for black but it doesn´t seem bad. Rook on 8th line still is a valuable defensive piece.
1022,28,11,Bf6,b'r1nr2k1/1bq2ppp/pp3b2/2p2R2/N1P1P3/P1NnB1PQ/6BP/5RK1 w - -', As said before Black´s Bf6 with b5 make the white position a very delicate if not a lost one.

Maybe not to win but at least to create danger and confusion. Draw is the price to aim for now and it doesn´t seem and easy one but better than trying to hold the position without the sacrifice.
1024,28,13,Ne7,b'r2r2k1/1bq1np1p/pp3p1B/2p5/N1P1P3/P1Nn2PQ/6BP/5RK1 w - -',It negates any chances of mate.

1028,28,17,3Ng4,b'2br3k/5p1p/p5n1/2p3B1/2P1P1N1/P5P1/6BP/6K1 b - -',? Not a clear continuation. Time and position doesn´t help either.

Plus with Rxa4 Rb3 white can get chances to attack the d6 pawn with a series of checks against my king and I wanted to protect my d-pawn after taking on d5. After Rb3 it is not so wise to play Rb4 and making the exchange. White's king can get to my pawns quickly--though it would still probably be in my favor.

But White does not have other options that are more appealing. Rb8+ Ke7 Rb7+ Kf6 Rb6 Rd4 Rxd6+ Ke7 Ra6 a5 and white again will eventually lose a pawn.

1199,38,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi all! Queen's pawns games are often considered to be less tactically sharp than games that begin with 1. e4. But this game certainly shows tactics can come in very quickly in some variations! This was a hard-fought game where white sacrifices material early to try to keep the initiative and not allow black to consolidate his material edge. It's a tense battle with Black succeeding over time to force some of white's aggressive pieces off the board. So how did it turn out? Well read on and don't forget to comment and rate.
1200,38,1,Qc2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PPQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',The third most popular choice. Much more popular are Nc3 followed by e3. Qc2 breaks the rule of moving the queen too early but since it often ends up on c2 in QPG it's somewhat justified.
1201,38,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2pP4/5N2/PPQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Making the queen move again...

Qc5+ runs into 11...Ke6 to protect the knight and the queen is under fire from the bishop. So my idea is to get the queen away from attack on either c4 or c5 and to get her onto b3 but with check.
1211,38,12,1Ke6,b'r2q1b1r/pp3Ppp/2p1kn2/4n3/1Q2P3/2N2b2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Probably a mistake. The downside of 11.Qb4 was that it allows Kxf7 but after 12. Qb3+ Kg6 the position is still a little unclear.

This was blacks best piece so it must be pinned. If the 13. gxf3 to get the piece back ...Nxf3 is painful for white as white is vulnerable to forks... For instance... 14. Kd1 Ke5+ 15. Kc2?? Nd4+ winning the queen.
1213,38,14,1Bh5,b'r2q1b1r/pp3Ppp/2pk1n2/4n2b/4PB2/1QN5/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',With the knight pinned the bishop now needs to save itself keeping guard of d1 preventing either Rd1+ or O-O-O

1226,38,27,2Ke8,b'r3kb1r/ppRnqbpp/8/4B3/4P3/3Q1P2/PP4PP/4KB1R w K -',Unpinning the knight and renewing the threat on Be5.

1229,38,30,2Bc3,b'r3kb1r/ppRn1bpp/8/1Q6/1q2P3/2B2P2/PP4PP/4KB1R b K -',! Putting the question to the queen.
1230,38,31,2Bxb5,b'r3kb1r/ppRn1bpp/8/1B6/4P3/2B2P2/PP4PP/4K2R b K -',And the LSB replaces the queen and keeps the pin.
1231,38,32,2Rd8,b'3rkb1r/ppRn1bpp/8/1B6/4P3/2B2P2/PP4PP/4K2R w K -',? I think Be6 is a little more flexible although black does still have issues most notably ideas like Kf2 Rd1 f4 f5 and or e5 e6 in some variations. The rook is now threatened by the DSB.
1232,38,33,2Rxb7,b'3rkb1r/pR1n1bpp/8/1B6/4P3/2B2P2/PP4PP/4K2R b K -',! I'll allow myself an exclamation mark for this move as removing the b-pawn opens the a5-d8 diagonal while clearing the rook at the same time.
1233,38,34,2Bc5,b'3rk2r/pR1n1bpp/8/1Bb5/4P3/2B2P2/PP4PP/4K2R w K -',Black moves to interrupt with Bb6.
1234,38,35,2b4,b'3rk2r/pR1n1bpp/8/1Bb5/1P2P3/2B2P2/P5PP/4K2R b K b3',Did not like Bxg7 here as Black's rook gets active after Rg8. This forces the Black bishop to move again to a worse diagonal. It needs to stay on the a3-f7 diagonal to prevent against Bxg7 followed by Bf6 eliminating black's rook from protecting the knight (Black needs to have Be7 as a resource if ever white plays Bxg7). So Black must leave the a7-g2 diagonal which will allow Kf2 activating the rook while keeping guard of g2 in case the g-file opens for black.
1235,38,36,2Rxa7,b'3rk2r/R2nbbpp/8/1B6/1P2P3/2B2P2/P5PP/4K2R b K -',Creating two outside passed pawns and protecting the a2 pawn from the black sniper. 27. Kf2 a6 brings black some reprieve. Now the pin is still in tact.

1237,38,38,2Bxf6,b'3rk2r/R2n1bpp/5B2/1B6/1P2P3/5P2/P5PP/4K2R b K -',White accepts since white's bishop did not have a promising future anywhere else.

1243,38,44,3Rg7,b'3rk3/R2n2rp/4bp2/1B6/1P2PP2/8/P4KPP/3R4 w - -',I thought f5 would have been better since there's a neat little trick in the following line: 31...f5 32. exf5 Bxf5 33. Rd5! Rxg2+!? 34. Kxg2? Be4+! 35. Kg3 Bxd5 and black is still worse but has some hope to draw the endgame. However instead of 34. Kxg2? Kf3! keeps white's strong advantage.
1244,38,45,3f5,b'3rk3/R2n2rp/4bp2/1B3P2/1P2P3/8/P4KPP/3R4 b - -',Driving back the bishop.
1245,38,46,3Bg8,b'3rk1b1/R2n2rp/5p2/1B3P2/1P2P3/8/P4KPP/3R4 w - -',Only move so as not to interfere with the rook. Notice white's control of all the squares on the a2-e6 diagonal.
1246,38,47,3Bc6,b'3rk1b1/R2n2rp/2B2p2/5P2/1P2P3/8/P4KPP/3R4 b - -',White voluntarily gives up control of c4 because what can black's bishop do there? All black's pieces are tied down to the knight and the king can't move out of the pin without dropping the knight so white is free do to do what he wants. Black is not quite in zugzwang but can't make any moves that improve his position.
1247,38,48,3b5,b'3rk1b1/R2nr2p/2B2p2/1P3P2/4P3/8/P4KPP/3R4 b - -',Simple - promote the pawn and win.

1250,38,51,3Rdxd7,b'3r1k2/R2Rrb1p/1PB2p2/5P2/4P3/8/P4KPP/8 b - -',And black resigns as soon the b-pawn will promote.
