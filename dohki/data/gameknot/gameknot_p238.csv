100,1,9,1Bf4,b'2kr1b1r/1bq2pp1/p1pp1n1p/8/Q1N1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',More pressure on d6 but black's castle brought a rook into the defense. Now the pawn is pinned by the white bishop on f4 and cannot immediately advance. Of note it might have been imprudent for black to castle queenside with white having 4 pieces already on the queenside bearing down on a broken pawn formation.
101,1,10,1Nxd6+,b'2kr1b1r/1bqn1pp1/p1pN3p/8/Q3PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Black's knight on d7 blocks his rook's defense of the pawn on d6. Three to two time to pounce. I'm now up by two pawns so I feel a little liquidation is in order. Black will either recapture with his bishop or I will be free to take the bishop on b7 next move. Either way I'll trade this knight for a bishop.
102,1,11,1Bxd6,b'2kr3r/1bqn1pp1/p1pB3p/8/Q3P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',As planned. The black queen only has one move.
103,1,12,1Ne2,b'2kr3r/1b1n1pp1/pqpB3p/8/Q3P3/8/PPP1NPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',En route to d4 to threaten the isolated pawn on c6. I am not worried about the pawn on b2. It is very well defended.
104,1,13,1Rab1,b'2kr3r/1b1n1pp1/p1pB3p/8/Q3P3/8/PqP1NPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',I have to give 16. ... Qxb2?? a pair of question marks. Black has no choices now his queen must die.
105,1,14,1Qa5,b'2kr3r/1b1n1pp1/p1pB1q1p/Q7/4P3/8/P1P1NPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Instead black ran to the only square on the board on which his queen doesn't die leaving a beautiful hole for the white queen. Black now has some ugly choices. 18. ... Qxd6 saves him from checkmate but he loses his queen to a mere bishop when he's already a pawn down. 18. ... Nb6 19 Qxb6 Kd7 gives the black king a little running space but 20. Be5  still wins the black queen and white picked up the black knight along the way. So black resigned at this point. Perhaps my footnote after black's 12th move regarding the prudence of castling into an attack may have borne some relevance.

After the disappointment of missing out on my first ever Master Draw I did receive some consolation in a white flag from a fellow 1700 player in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament.  It all started as a standard Sicilian Defence but unlike many Sicilians that I have played in on gameknot I reverted to exchanging on c6 something I used to do in my OTB tourneys with mixed results.

Now Henry's job is to shepherd his kingside infantrymen towards Glendadom.  On move 44 I push my pawn to g5 for the start of this plan.  Black sees he cannot stop this and waves the white flag.

The bishop's more of a pain in the ass piece to get a use out of come end game {pawns standing on the opposite color as a bishop prove untouchable} and less tricky/dangerous in the beginning. But these decisions must not be made hastily instead they must be made according to the situation and in this situation the horsie was the piece to lose...as wonderful as horsies are.]

(Ruachessnut2 and Nuntar have rather aptly pointed out to me that this is not entirely the case. Basically Hilo's rather daring moves could have went better had he made some rather spectacular tactical decisions to back them up crushing me utterly. This may be true but I don't think we should forget that players with 1200 ratings are not Bobby Fischer and until they become as good as he is they need to play a little more carefully than he would. Therefor I say don't dive into the fray counting on your ability to manage a piece being attacked from 3 places at once that is pinned to another piece that also needs to be defended because of complicated and terrible future following dominos that your brain can barely comprehend. Play it defensive I say. It is a poor teacher who doesn't advise his student to learn the basics. They say beginners should castle early and experts should consider not castling at all. Perhaps Ruachessnut2 and Nuntar would simple tell a beginner to play like an expert but I say...castle early dangit!) Still thank you boys for the advice. If you felt like saying something positive in the future some people respond well to that kind of thing...or so I've heard.

Black's disadvantages before this move were: loss of a piece and uncompleted development with black king in the center. The latter could be improved by castling NOW.

With this move black helps white by opening lines in front of the king and ruins own chances of castling (black can't castle for a few moves now)

White defended and won a peice after the blunder by black on move 11. Another mistake by black opened up the center so white's attack was made much easier. Black almost gained an equal game after white's mistake that lost white bishop but did not hold on to it after overlooking white's clever double fork. So overall white played good in both attack and defense (with only one serious mistake in the game) but black made several mistakes stemming from not calculating just a few more moves and not castling before beginning an attack.

It's in the GK DB but my Sicilian book doesn't talk about it nor does Wikipedia. It seems weird costing black a tempo but it does strike at the center. I thought it might be fun to try.

285,15,7,Nb6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/1n2pn2/3p4/3N1PP1/2N1B3/PPP1Q2P/2KR3R w - -',I'm starting to get concerned about white's advancing pawns. My pieces need a bit more mobility and I want to trade away white's pieces so I wanted to move my knight off of d7. But moving it away from those advancing pawns made me a little nervous.
286,15,8,e5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/1n3n2/3ppP2/3N2P1/2N1B3/PPP1Q2P/2KR3R w - -',Capturing on f5 seemed like a bad idea isolating the d5 pawn. Better to strike out at white's pieces and maintain decent pawn structure. If white retreats the knight from d4 black can play 15. ... d4 and fork white's bishop on e3 and knight on c3. Of course black's d-pawn is pinned to his queen by the rook on d1 so black would have to waste a move unpinning the pawn which would allow white to save both pieces.
287,15,9,exd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/1n3n2/3p1PP1/3p4/2N1B3/PPP1Q2P/2KR3R w - -',White counterattacked the black knight on f6. Since the fork on d5 isn't really going to succeed I decide on a different approach to break up the white pawn advance before it crushes me. I am expecting white to respond with 16. gxf6 maintaining material balance.
288,15,10,Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/pp2bppp/1n6/3p1PP1/3B4/2N5/PPP1Q2P/2KR3R w - -',White surprised me recapturing on d4 which loses material for him but his advanced kingside pawns are still looming large and now black's pawn at d5 is isolated and likely to fall. Black's knight on e8 is virtually undeveloped though it may be a critical defender in white's upcoming kingside attack.
289,15,11,Nc8,b'r1nqnrk1/pp2bppp/8/3p1PP1/3B3P/2N5/PPP1Q3/2KR3R w - -',White added a third pawn to his attack. Yikes! OK that knight I moved to b6 four moves ago is severely misplaced. I need to bring him back to defend my king but d7 won't work or the black pawn on d5 falls immediately. The black pieces are a mess all lined up on the back rank like little ducks all in a row about as far from being effective as they can be.
290,15,12,f6,b'r1nqnrk1/pp2b1pp/5p2/3p1PP1/3B2QP/2N5/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Black has to do something to strike out at the advancing white pawns. The f-pawn is supported here by pawn bishop knight rook and queen. That's a severely strong pawn.
291,15,13,h6,b'r1nqnrk1/pp2b1p1/5pPp/3p1P2/3B2QP/2N5/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',White avoids the exchange and in the process seems to overextend his attack. Of course black wouldn't want to capture at g6 for then there is no escape from 20. fxg6 21. Qh5 22. Qh7#.
292,15,14,Nc7,b'r1nq1rk1/ppn1b1p1/5pPp/3p1P2/6QP/2N1B3/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',The black pawn on h6 is about to fall. Black's king needs running room. Black's rook on f8 needs queen support. And the pawn on d5 needs a defender now. Since g7 is not quite such a high priority now the knight on e8 is just in the way.
293,15,15,gxh6,b'r1nq1rk1/ppn1b3/5pPp/3p1P2/6QP/2N5/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Accepting the sacrifice. I didn't feel white had enough material on scene to press his attack to conclusion.
294,15,16,Rf7,b'r1nq2k1/ppn1brP1/5p1p/3p1P2/6QP/2N5/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',White's pawns are now over extended. The g-pawn won't have long to live.

297,15,19,Rxg7,b'r1n3k1/ppnq2r1/5p1p/2bp1P2/6QP/2N5/PPP3R1/2K1R3 w - -',White's rook move freed the black queen from defense of d5; the black knight on c7 is adequate to hold against white's knight on c3. Time for white's impetuous pawn on g7 to die.
298,15,20,Nb6,b'r5k1/ppnq2r1/1n3p1p/2bp1P2/7P/2N2Q2/PPP3R1/2K1R3 w - -',Maybe exchanging rooks to take advantage of black's two-piece material lead was called for. As played black wanted to open his other rook on a8 to defend the back rank and be ready to jump into offensive action when needed and at the same time move his knight off the bank rank so it could be more effective too and add some defense on d5 if it becomes needed.
299,15,21,Re8,b'4r1k1/ppnq2r1/1n3p1p/2bp1P2/7P/2N2Q2/PPPR4/2K1R3 w - -',Black has weathered the storm. White's kingside pawns are isolated and blocked and the black king is adequately defended. It's time to get an inactive rook out onto an open file and challenge white.

Even though white has more attackers than there are black defenders two of the attackers are major pieces so white will lose material capturing on d5. It seems after all the exchanges that white will end up with a queen on d5 forking the black king and the black bishop on c5 but after black moves out of check white cannot play Qxc5??? or he will lose immediately to black's Qe1#.

And it allows exchange of knights with 35. ... Nxd5 36. Qxd5  but now white is forking the black king and the bishop on c5 and white seems to win material so I didn't make this move in the game. Upon further examination black's response would be 36. ... Qf2! blocking the check and skewering the white queen to her king forcing an exchange of queens and an endgame where black is ahead by a bishop and knight.

308,15,30,Bf8,b'5bk1/ppn5/5p1Q/5q2/N2p3P/P3n3/KPP5/8 w - -',White's knight was en prise so running from the pawn seems like the right thing to do. But white overlooked the greater danger and now his queen has nowhere to run nowhere to hide. Already two pieces down white is about to become down by a queen and a minor piece. Instead he took the noble way out and resigned before his lovely lady had to lose her head.

It also tempts black to avoid Be7 breaking the pin on his knight at f6.

It is rather awkward to protect doubled pawns. 16. ... Qd6 17. Rd1 Qb8 would hold the pawn for now but leave the black queen in a strange and distant place.
361,18,16,1Rd1,b'r1bqk2r/5ppp/4pn2/4Q1B1/p3P3/7P/BPP2PP1/3RK2R b Kkq -',This is when my plan formed. Black's king is exposed in the center. A rook on d8 supported by the bishop on g5 would be checkmate. There is the small matter of black's queen and knight - time to drive them off. It's worth noting that there are lots of things black can do to prevent this checkmate. It's risky to make bad moves that might end in a checkmate especially if your opponent has simple ways to escape the mate. So if the checkmate you want to play for is not a forced checkmate then make sure the moves you make along the way are sound moves so that you don't leave yourself worse off for trying for the failed checkmate. First step chase away black's queen. This move also places a white rook powerfully on the open d-file - always an excellent place for a rook. And it does so with a threat against black's queen buying white a tempo.
362,18,17,1Qxa5,b'r1b1k2r/5ppp/4pn2/Q5B1/p3P3/7P/BPP2PP1/3RK2R b Kkq -',Even better black wants to trade queens. White is a pawn ahead and welcomes this trade. Another consideration is worth noting. Even though I drove the queen off of d8 she still protects d8. Here is a secret: When any piece moves it automatically defends the space from which it moved. I know that sounds obvious but consider the implications. Driving a piece from a square does not automatically mean you control the square. More often that square is still in contention as is the case with d8 after black's 18th move. The queen exchange will solve that.
363,18,18,2f4,b'2b1k2r/5ppp/4pn2/r5B1/p3PP2/7P/BPP3P1/3RK2R b Kk f3',I'm halfway there but now I need to chase off the knight. 20. e5 would be awesome except for the fact that black would play 20. ... Rxe5  and my dreams would die unfulfilled. Black is also threatening my bishop on g5 with that same rook. Fortunately there is one move on the board that solves both concerns. 20. f4! prepares for the advance of 21. e5 and it also defends the white bishop.
364,18,19,2Rd8#,b'2bRk2r/5ppp/4p3/r5B1/p3nP2/7P/BPP3P1/4K2R b Kk -',Ahh there it is. I didn't expect to actually succeed in the checkmate. Black could have avoided it many ways. 20. ... 0-0 would have worked though 21. Bxf6 does more damage to black's pawn structure. 20. ... Nd7 also would have worked with no worries about the pawns. 20. ... h6!? would have been interesting driving the white bishop off of the h4-d8 diagonal but at the cost of further exchanges that favor white. Still while the mate was not expected the moves leading up to it were all valuable moves that advanced white's game so had black averted disaster at the end white would have been in a solid position to go on and win the game. The final position is worthy of study. It arises in many games. The triangle formed by white's bishop and rook and the edge of the board is a common mating theme. All it takes is for a piece to exist where the black pawn at f7 is in this example. The rook and bishop cover all the squares to which the king might flee except the one diagonally away from the rook. Here black's f7 pawn contributes to the mate. This triangular checkmate formation (the diagonal between the bishop and rook form the hypotenuse) comes up surprisingly often. I call it the Bermuda Triangle. I don't know if the chess world has a different name for it. Recognizing the formation is a good way to find the checkmates and use them against your opponents or avoid them when your opponent wants to use them against you.

I will tell you a little more about the term being ""Freddied"" - I am also a cricket fan and in the England cricket team there is a strike bowler and former England Skipper (who is partial to pedaloes!) who is called Andrew Flintoff and has a nickname Freddy.  So when an opposing batsman is clean bowled by Andrew Flintoff he is known to be ""Freddied"" - so same applies to the opponents on the receiving end of a checkmate from the Master Mater!  I have a MasterPlan though tee hee hee!  I simply plan a forced queen trade even if it means Henry going to d1.  Because the Wicked Witch of the West has had my Henry 4 times out of 5 I would dearly lurve to see the back of her!  8. h3 is stage 1 - stop a knight incursion on g4.

I figure this is where my attack will peter out. Black has a good reply to defend against the fork of his king and his rook on f8 and white has to consider retreating the bishop and regrouping.

Although it does prevent an exchange of queens after black plays Bxe4. The white rook on d1 seizes an open file the very file aimed at black's exposed king. But there is a sneakier threat that black should alleviate immediately.
434,21,13,1Qxf8+,b'r2k1Q2/pp1n2p1/2b3Bp/2p5/1q2n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBR2K1 b - -',Black didn't see the sneaky threat so I felt obligated to show him. I have to admit I didn't think it was all that sneaky and I had expected him to save the rook. The rook at d1 maintains the pin on the black knight on d7. Since that knight is the only defender of the rook on f8 and it cannot defend while it is pinned the rook is defenseless. Both rooks in fact.

Of course a7 is undefended so the queen can escape - but white has bigger fish to fry. The bishop move sets the queen free because it skewers the black king to the knight and the lone king cannot defend that knight against both the white queen and white bishop. Even better 19. Bf4  threatens immediate mate. Black can prevent immediate mate with 19. ... Nd6 20. Bxd6  Kd7 21. Bxc5  K-any 22.

White loses a tempo but then black must retreat or advance his bishop also losing a tempo.

580,29,0,1Bh6,b'1rb1kb2/2pqpppr/ppnQpn1B/7p/8/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQ -',Basically as you can see white is failing in it's attempt to lose by placing its pieces up against black's pieces.
581,29,1,Rb8,b'1rbnkb2/2pqpppr/ppPQp2B/1B5p/1n6/8/PP3PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ -',Now that I'm here I basically couldn't help myself. I finish him off.

583,30,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A flexible response
584,30,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Heading for my usual King's Indian formation
585,30,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A conservative approach.  This is looking like Colle or London System territory common among weaker players.
586,30,3,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! Consistent with the Colle and London Systems but I always think a Bd3 is misplaced against a Black Kingside fianchetto unless White plans a pawn assault on the f-file.
587,30,4,c4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ c3',Slightly more agressive than the typical 5. c3.  If I felt like it I could transpose to a Grunfeld with 5... d5 but for now I prefer to play the standard KI moves with ... d6 and e5 which is even more tempting if White hasn't put a pawn on e4 adn can potentially be forked from e4 by my pawn.
588,30,5,Rb1,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/1RBQK2R b K -',? obviously concerned about the B on the long diagonal but castling was more urgent
589,30,6,dxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4P3/2P5/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/1RBQK2R b K -',?! looks harmless enough but White is sleepwalking into trouble

591,30,8,Nc5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/2n1p3/2P1P3/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/1RBQK2R w K -',! attacking the undefended B
592,30,9,Nd3+,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/3n1N2/PPBN1PPP/1RBQK2R w K -',An unusual opportunity.  I felt like Freddy the Big Bad Wolf here!
593,30,10,Qxd3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/3q1N2/PP1N1PPP/1RBQK2R w K -',White is suddenly very cramped and inconvenienced with castling impossible.

596,30,13,Qxe2+,b'r4rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P1b1/5N2/PP1NqPPP/R1B1K2R w K -',Perhaps early to swap Qs when my attack has hardly got going but White will have trouble finding safety for her K and her pieces remain in disarray
597,30,14,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P1b1/5N2/PP1NKPPP/R1B4R w - -',! This powerful rook dominates the rest of the game.
598,30,15,Nd3,b'2br1rk1/ppp2pbp/6p1/4p3/2P1P3/1P1n1N1P/P2N1PP1/R1B2K1R w - -',! the second N lands on the troublesome d3 square

601,30,18,e3+,b'3r1rk1/pb4bp/1p4p1/2p1p3/2P5/BP1Np1PP/P2N1PK1/R4R2 w - -',Seemed more forcing than exd3.  I'm not sure how good it really is.  Though it was sufficient for this game.
602,30,19,2b4,b'3r2k1/pb4bp/1p4p1/2p5/1PP1p3/B4rPP/PN1p1P2/3R1RK1 b - -',?? the first outright blunder that I spotted anyway.
603,30,20,Be5,b'3r2k1/p6p/1p4p1/2p1b3/1PP1b3/6rP/P2p1R1K/3R4 w - -',! I like this move!  White has no escape now.
604,30,21,Rgxd2+,b'3r2k1/p6p/1p4p1/2p1b3/1PP1b3/7P/P2r4/3R3K w - -',and White gave up the ghost.  She had used 44 minutes I'd used 15... Hence my opportunity to catch up on Gameknot :-)
605,31,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi welcome to my second game annotation. I'm not a pro player and I often play intuitively or even shortsighted. So you probably won't see any big schemes played out.
606,31,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"I don't like the queen's pawn opening as much as the ""classic"" king's pawn but I got used to it a little by now since it seems to be popular at least against me. ;)"
607,31,2,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Pretty defensive move at this point I got nothing out against what is he defending right now?
608,31,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I turn around the routine of trying to get the pawn out of the centre.
609,31,4,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2pP4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He didn't want and I didn't want a double pawn so I just stepped forward. It opens up a nice line for my black bishop.
610,31,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/4pn2/1p1p4/2pP1B2/1P2PN1P/P1P2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',By now I thought I stood pretty nicely solid pawn line only very little figures out.
611,31,6,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/3bpn2/1p1p4/2pP1B2/PP2PN1P/2P2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',So time to get them out aggressively.
612,31,7,Nbd7,b'r3k2r/p2n1ppp/b2qpn2/1p1p4/2pP4/PPN1PN1P/2P1BPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Now I was able to do both rochades which I like because I like to think that my opponent doesn't know as to what side to concentrate on. Obviously the king's side is more attractive so I probably fooled no one here.
613,31,8,e5,b'r3k2r/p2n1ppp/b2q1n2/1p1pp3/2pP4/PPN1PN1P/2P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',But first let's clear up the centre a little.
614,31,9,dxe4,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/b2q4/4n3/2pNp3/P3P2P/2P1BPP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',This was probably not so good for me since I have two helpless baby pawns that I have to take care for
615,31,10,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/b2q4/4n3/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/4BPP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',An open line? I like that.
616,31,11,1Qc2,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/b2q4/4n3/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/R3R1K1 b - -',And here goes the pawn attack.
617,31,12,1f5,b'1r3rk1/p5pp/b2q4/4np2/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/R3R1K1 w - f6',Had to rip up my kings castle.

620,31,15,2Rab1,b'1r3rk1/p5pp/b6q/4np2/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/1R1R2K1 b - -',Now he wants the line too....
621,31,16,2Rxb1,b'5rk1/p5pp/b6q/4np2/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/1r1R2K1 w - -',So I exchanged...in hindsight maybe not that smart.
622,31,17,2Rxb1,b'5rk1/p5pp/b6q/4np2/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/1R4K1 b - -',because now it's his line. And he'll use it.
623,31,18,2Bc8,b'2b2rk1/p5pp/7q/4np2/2pNp3/P1P1P2P/2Q1BPP1/1R4K1 w - -',I wanted to get the white bishop to the king's side too but that was a bad position as we'll see.
624,31,19,2Qa4,b'2b2rk1/p5pp/7q/4np2/Q1pNp3/P1P1P2P/4BPP1/1R4K1 b - -',He goes at it.
625,31,20,2a6,b'2b2rk1/6pp/p6q/4np2/Q1pNp3/P1P1P2P/4BPP1/1R4K1 w - -',what else could I do? Little did I know but this pawn would be my win.
626,31,21,2Bxc4+,b'2b2rk1/6pp/p6q/4np2/Q1BNp3/P1P1P2P/5PP1/1R4K1 b - -',That hurt because after ...Nxc4 Qc4  I would feel very uncomfortable.
627,31,22,2Kh8,b'2b2r1k/6pp/p6q/4np2/Q1BNp3/P1P1P2P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - -',So I went into defensive right away. Too bad that I couldn't open the castle with the h pawn because of the queen it would have saved me a lot of trouble.
628,31,23,f4,b'2b2r1k/6pp/p6q/3Bn3/Q2Npp2/P1P1P2P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - -',I think I wanted to put my rook on the f line to use and tried opening it up.
629,31,24,Rxf4,b'2b4k/6pp/p6q/3Bn3/Q2Npr2/P1P4P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - -',which worked.
630,31,25,2Rb8,b'1Rb4k/6pp/p6q/3Bn3/Q2Npr2/P1P4P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',Very good move. He practically bound my Bishop and an there was an immediate mate.
631,31,26,2Rf8,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p6q/3Bn3/Q2Np3/P1P4P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',So I had to move back to defend my king but it was getting dangerous now.
632,31,27,2Bxe4,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p6q/4n3/Q2NB3/P1P4P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',There went the other pawn.
633,31,28,2Qg5,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n1q1/Q2NB3/P1P4P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',Baaaaaad move. I had to make way for the h pawn and maybe I dreamed of Nf3 if both his knight and bishop would miraculously disappear but after 28. Ne6 I would either lose my rook or after ...Bxe6 29. Rxf8  .
634,31,29,2Qb4,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n1q1/1Q1NB3/P1P4P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',But uuuuh he missed it. But that's the game for not so experienced players we win if the other one makes mistakes that we see and we lose if we make mistakes the other one sees.
635,31,30,2Qc1+,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n3/1Q1NB3/P1P4P/5PP1/2q3K1 w - -',I don't remember how I got that move but this really turned around the game. Or more specifically it turned it from a one side danger to a thriller for both of us.
636,31,31,2Kh2,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n3/1Q1NB3/P1P4P/5PPK/2q5 b - -',No other possibility there.
637,31,32,2Qf4+,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n3/1Q1NBq2/P1P4P/5PPK/8 w - -',I continued to attack him with my rook bishop and knight I really saw some possibilities here. I only would have to take care not to get a cheap mate by forgetting about my bad king position.
638,31,33,3g3,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n3/1Q1NBq2/P1P3PP/5P1K/8 b - -',Only other way except going down again and he probably wanted to win so he didn't want a threefold repitition.
639,31,34,3Qxf2+,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/4n3/1Q1NB3/P1P3PP/5q1K/8 w - -',But now it got very interesting.
640,31,35,Nd3,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/8/1Q1N4/P1Pn2PP/5qBK/8 w - -',I needed a bigger army for that so I moved my horse and nicely attacked his queen at the same time so I wouldn't lose a tempo.
641,31,36,Ne1,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/8/2QN4/P1P3PP/5qBK/4n3 w - -',Of course ...Qxg2   was right at the door.
642,31,37,3Qc6,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p1Q5/8/3N4/P1P3PP/5qBK/4n3 b - -',But he saw it and cleverly used his queen.
643,31,38,3Nxg2,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p1Q5/8/3N4/P1P3PP/5qnK/8 w - -',I saw no other chance but to burn some material.
644,31,39,3Kxg2,b'1Rb2r1k/6pp/p7/8/3N4/P1P3PP/6K1/8 b - -',And here I got struck by luck again and saw the possibilities.
645,31,40,3Bxh3+,b'1R3r1k/6pp/p7/8/3N4/P1P3Pb/6K1/8 w - -',I sacrificed my bishop to get his rook.
646,31,41,Rxb8,b'1r5k/6pp/p7/8/3N4/P1P3PK/8/8 w - -',From here it was just a matter of staying disciplined and watching out for that horrible knight of his.
647,31,42,Rc5,b'7k/6pp/p7/2r5/6K1/P1P3P1/4N3/8 w - -',First I drew a line for all white figures. I didn't want one white figure in my half.
648,31,43,3Kf4,b'7k/6pp/p7/2r5/5K2/P1P3P1/4N3/8 b - -',Here we can already see that there's really nothing he could do anymore but wait for a mistake made by me.
649,31,44,3h6,b'7k/6p1/p6p/2r5/5K2/P1P3P1/4N3/8 w - -',Off we go.
650,31,45,Kg7,b'8/6k1/p6p/4r1p1/8/P1PK2P1/4N3/8 w - -',Of course the king was needed now to help get a pawn through.
651,31,46,Rc5,b'8/8/2N1k2p/p1r5/P1P2Kp1/6P1/8/8 w - -',I liked this move. The white king was lured away by the g pawn and so I could attack both his c pawn and the knight. One of them would have to go.
652,31,47,5Nd4+,b'8/8/4k2p/p1r5/P1PN1Kp1/6P1/8/8 b - -',Obviously he chose the pawn to go.
653,31,48,5Ke3,b'8/8/5k1p/p1r5/P1PN2p1/4K1P1/8/8 b - -',To late dear white king your c pawn is history. And somehow I sensed that the a pawn wouldn't have long to live either.
654,31,49,Rxa4,b'8/8/5k1p/p7/r5p1/4K1P1/4N3/8 w - -',I knew it.
655,31,50,5Kf2,b'8/1N6/7p/p4k2/4r1p1/6P1/5K2/8 b - -',He could have given up by now but I don't know if I would have...Against a >1300 maybe but there's always a chance of THE big mistake like right there if I say did  a4? now 58. Nd6 ! might have turned around the game or at least given him the draw.
656,31,51,5Ra4,b'8/1N6/7p/p4k2/r5p1/6P1/5K2/8 w - -',But no way.
657,31,52,6Nxh6,b'8/8/7N/p7/r3k1p1/6P1/5K2/8 b - -',I put all my money on the a pawn now the others were just distraction.
658,31,53,6Kg1,b'8/8/7N/p7/4k1p1/6P1/r7/6K1 b - -',This is where I like my kings.
659,31,54,a4,b'8/8/8/5N2/p5p1/5kP1/r7/6K1 w - -',Finish line was already visible.
660,31,55,a1=R#,b'8/8/8/5N2/6p1/5kP1/1r6/r5K1 w - -',And that was it. A fine game with some great and suspense moments.
661,32,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',this is the initial position
662,32,1,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1nppp/3b4/3P4/2BP1pb1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',developing very quickly all the pieces.
663,32,2,Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/pppnnppp/3b4/3P4/2BP1pb1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',threatening Nb6 and after Bb3  a5 and maybe c6 also
664,32,3,Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pppnnppp/3b4/3P4/3P1pb1/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',? it is a mistake . better was Nf6 defending the king's flank
665,32,4,1Bxh7+,b'r2qr1k1/pppnnppB/3b4/3P4/3P1pb1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',!!! very interesting move!

668,32,7,Qb6,b'r3r3/pp2nk2/1q3n1Q/3p1p2/3P4/2N5/PPP3P1/4RRK1 w - -',the attack has already finished and the black has a extra piece
669,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Let this serve as a warning to those who would quit on games early in to save their ratings. It doesn't always work. Jonny let's the clock run out after move 4 after suffering a slight setback. The game is rated.
670,33,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Central pawns. This is how you do it.
671,33,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I guard the pawn.
672,33,3,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3nP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He attacks anyway.
673,33,4,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He dies and lets the clock run out probably hoping the game would not wind up rated but it is and he's lost a game official and on the record due more to cowardice than ineptitude. Take that Jonny97!
674,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is the craziest and most open game I have ever played in GameKnot and probably in my short chess life. (It is technically still in progress but I am (thankfully!) only a few moves away from victory now.) It is a game where my Queen just does not know how to die and rises from her ashes.. and not only once! So off with the King's Pawn.
675,34,1,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now normally 3.. Nxe4! here is the book move but actually it does not win that easily after c3. I don't know if he did it with that knowledge or not but later on he failed to build on this move which was so critical.
676,34,2,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4n3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I still do the move without any concerns.. I should have had some!

The threat of black playing his pawn to g5 and opening that file with his queen ready to pounce left me reluctant to recapture with 25. Rxb1 despite my desire to post a rook on the open file. My queen will have to serve that duty for now.

This is where I entered a slew of conditional moves covering an array of black responses none of which did him much good. I went to bed and before I knew it I had a checkmate message in my mailbox. I love checkmates in my sleep.

Kf8 lets black escape checkmate but he he seems to the rest of his kingside pawns and must sacrifice to stop the advancing white pawn before it promotes. It looks however like black could have weaseled out with careful play. Instead he captured the pawn.
