So, after careful consideration, I thought that this was the best move available for white.  Part of the reason is that it also enables me to castle when Stanley retreats."

Plus, I have a plan for when he exchanges.  But, I overlooked one move, 25...Rxb2 winning back a pawn.  In fact, although it would be very difficult to win, this loses because it will allow Stanley to pick up an additional pawn on c2 since a back rank mate is also threatened.  And, with that one extra pawn, it's still a win with best from black.  However, there would be nothing easy about the win.  Later on is where I really go wrong."

This only leaves me with one option, 28.Re1, but 28...Rxe1# is mate. I thought that the threat was gone since there was the window out of a back rank mate, with just the R.  I completely forgot that the Knight was a monster, as well. We analyzed it, and 27.g3 was the only move.  After, 27...Kg7, it looked like a possible draw with best play from white.  However, black would still have a won game after something like 28.Nd5 Rxc2 with that extra pawn.  As now, black has an unstoppable passed pawn that would, eventually, promote.  But, it would have been very difficult for Stanley to find the winning continuation.   Getting impulsive and going right after one of the doubled pawns is what lost, at once.  The problem was me forgetting that Stanley had more then one threat against my back rank."

Wolfgang (caveman1960) managed to get up into the low 2000s.  Although his rating has fallen below it, after this game I still strongly back him to get back up there.
