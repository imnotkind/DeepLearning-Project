0,0,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',c4 here is known as the English variation of the Caro-Kann. Not as popular as d4 but I know caveman plays the Kann and I have little chance trying to play popular book lines against him.
1,0,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Basic Kann English Exchange not as much theory available on this variation as others but that was the idea.
2,0,2,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/1B1P4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"Bb5+ an aggressive approach Nc3 is the more ""book"" play here. "
3,0,3,O-O,b'r2qkb1r/1b1npppp/p4n2/1p1P4/8/2N2N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Simple castle here continuing my development. Perhaps a bit premature plays like Qb3 or d4 were also playable but at this point I saw no need to rush.
4,0,4,1Re1,b'r2qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/p3p3/1p1n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Re1?! I wanted a4 here and it was probably correct but I was to concerned about 11. a4 b4?!. Obviously now a simple 12. Nxd5 and I would have been fine but I don't generally like to trade early on.
5,0,5,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p3p3/1p1nN3/3P4/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I believe this cost white winning chances. Obviously offering up a trade for black's weak knight on d7 and eventually leading to the queen exchange and busted pawn structure that you will see for white in the next few moves. The intention was actually to strengthen my pawn structure kingside by moving the isolated d pawn to e file and after black castled launching a kingside attack. All of whites pieces are aimed that direction and ready to go just a simple miscalculation. Should have played 12. Nxd5 Bxd5 13. Ne5... and continued with the same idea and I think I would have been ok.
6,0,6,1bxc3,b'r2bk2r/1b3ppp/p3p3/1p2P3/8/2P5/P3BPPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',There you have it busted pawn structure and no queen. Against an opponent as strong as caveman this endgame looked rough.
7,0,7,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/1b3ppp/p3p3/bp2P3/8/2P5/PB2BPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Rad1?! So far I've made some questionable rook plays this game. Obviously trying to grab the open file but black obviously has Bd5 attacking the Apawn I just abandoned in the corner. Just lost a tempo.....
8,0,8,1Ba3,b'r4rk1/5ppp/p3p3/bp1bP3/8/B1P5/P3BPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',...Ba3?? not just a tempo a pawn. I should have played 18. Rda1 and swallowed my pride with an embarrassing back and forth but I decided to try and be tricky and playing against high rated opponents I've found they're not easily tricked. Was thinking maybe 18. Ba3 Rfwherever 19. Bb4 Bxb4 20. cxb4...still down a pawn but a much more playable position. Still no need to sugarcoat it bad move 18. Rda1 should have been played.
9,0,9,1Bxc3,b'r4rk1/5ppp/p3p3/1p1bP3/8/B1b5/P3BPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Black taking advantage of the mistake Bxc3...free pawn as we move toward the endgame could be crushing for white. If you want to analyze it further you could go back to when the pawn structure was weakened and the c pawn and a pawn were left hanging causing the need for white to play defensively in this situation. If the structure was solid there would be more opportunity to play for open files and such.
10,0,10,Rc8,b'2r3k1/6pp/p2Bpp2/1p1bP3/5P2/P1b5/4B1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black claims the only open file on the board further strengthening their hold on the game. A nice play white probably should have played 22. Rdc1 with the same idea but black is just a step ahead at this point.
11,0,11,fxe5,b'2r3k1/6pp/p2Bp3/1p1bp3/5P2/P1b5/4BKPP/3R4 w - -',fxe5?! I thought black let me slide here. Much better was Bb3 and that's what I was expecting but this move relieved a lot of tension for the moment instead of piling on the pressure. Bb3 obviously threatens my rook white needs to keep the rook on the d file to prevent Bd4 check opening up the c file completely with tempo. But after 23. ....Bb3 24. Rd3?! Bc2 the file is opened anyway possible pins on the e2 bishop winning the a3 pawn even mating threats are possible if white doesn't play it right.
12,0,12,2Kg3,b'2r3k1/6pp/p2Bp3/bp1bP3/8/P5K1/4B1PP/3R4 b - -',I took a lot of time with this move. I felt there several possibilities. 25. Bd3 was the other option. K or B have to be moved because Rc2 would come with a nasty pin. I played 25. Kg3 with the hope of 25...Rc3+ 26. Rd3 giving me the possibility to remove black's powerful rook from the game.
13,0,13,2Rxc3,b'6k1/6pp/p2Bp3/bp2P3/2b5/P1R3K1/4B1PP/8 b - -',With that mission accomplished. I got the rook off the board was it perfectly played probably not. Was it the perfect plan probably not. Baby steps for white.
14,0,14,2Kf2,b'6k1/6pp/p2Bp3/1p2P3/2b5/P1b5/4BKPP/8 b - -',Simple idea here. If I take the bishop he has a passer up the c file after 28. Bxc4 bxc4 and my kings in the corner. If I play my king over to protect the bishop after 28. Kf2(Kf3) Bxe2 29. Kxe2 black has no passer and I've moved my king to center of the board. Black still has a 2 on 1 pawn majority queenside but baby steps for white.
15,0,15,2Kxe2,b'6k1/6pp/p2Bp3/1p2P3/8/P1b5/4K1PP/8 b - -',Baby steps
16,0,16,h5,b'6k1/6p1/3Bp3/pp2P2p/6P1/P2K4/7P/4b3 w - h6',I questioned this pawn sack by black at first thinking for the past several moves Kf7 should be played not understanding what this sacrifice accomplished. It turned out to be a very clever way to get the king into the game and start a run up that side of the board.
17,0,17,Kh7,b'8/6pk/3Bp3/pp2P2P/8/P2K4/7P/4b3 w - -',What's black's play?
18,0,18,3Bf8,b'5B2/6pk/4p3/pp2P2P/8/P2K4/7P/4b3 b - -',After 32....Kf8 the idea of the sack is clear and it turns out to be a very short term sacrifice. The king will eventually capture the h5 pawn without resistance. I spent a lot of time studying this position and found this little move 33. Bf8. It indirectly protects the h5 pawn for the moment due to the fact that if Kxh5 is ever played then Bxg7 will follow. Also note that the g7 pawn cannot be pushed because of the h5 pawn and in this position the white king is dominating the black bishop not allowing it to protect.
19,0,19,3Bd6,b'8/6p1/3Bp2k/pp2P2P/3b4/PK6/7P/8 b - -',After a little dance the h5 pawn falls but white manages to improve position by holding onto it for a few moves. 
20,0,20,g5,b'8/2B5/4p3/pp2P1pk/3b4/PK6/7P/8 w - g6',Black goes all out for the kingside here giving up the a5 pawn. Black will soon have two passed pawns with the king running with them. White might as well resign here right?
21,0,21,Bd6+,b'8/8/3bp3/Bp4pk/1K6/P7/7P/8 w - -',I didn't calculate this into any my lines leading to the end when it was played so I thought I might be in trouble. I think a simple Bxh2 may have been better. Would it have changed the outcome? Probably not.
22,0,22,Kh5,b'3B4/8/4p3/2K3pk/8/7P/1b6/8 w - -',At this point with black retreating I think I've pulled off a save. 43. Kxh3 would lead to a draw after 43....Bxg5 eventually sacking the bishop for the last pawn.
23,0,23,e4,b'8/8/4KB2/6p1/4p2k/7P/1b6/8 w - -',46. e4!?....At first I thought I had been given a gift but this turns out to be another one of caveman's clever little tricks.
24,0,24,4Bxb2,b'8/8/4K3/6p1/4p2k/7P/1B6/8 b - -',I have to play the obvious move here Bxb2. I did however take a lot of time because I know it can't be that simple.
25,0,25,4Kf5,b'8/8/8/5Kp1/7k/4p2P/1B6/8 b - -',Here Kf5 keeping it simple. Bd4 is also playable after 48. Bd4 e2 49. Bf2+ controlling the e1 queening square and holding. I chose to force the king to stay on the g5 pawn or lose it. If 48...e2 a simple 49. Bc3 will control the e1 square the g5 pawn can't advance due to the h3 pawn controlling g4.
26,0,26,Kh5,b'8/8/8/5Kpk/8/2B4P/4p3/8 w - -',49. Kh5??? and white accepts the draw. I had been so fixed on getting the draw that I was glad when it was finally offered and without a second look accepted. Problem is 49. Kh5 turns out to be the biggest blunder of the game. 49....Be1!! 50. Kh6 51. Kg4 Kg6 52. Kf3(Bd2 Bc3)....at that point it doesn't matter the black king is sealed off the e pawn will fall followed by the g pawn and white wins easily. It didn't happen that way however but a good lesson.
27,1,0,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',!? - An interesting opening choice by Coach Adams. The Center Game is an old opening. It was mostly abandoned by 1900 because no advantage could be demonstrated for White.
28,1,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This introduces a Danish Gambit variation.
29,1,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"According to the ECO this is classified as the Soerensen defence. Hard to pronounce (for me at least) but I find the coach's choice of opening against me very interesting. Of course who am I to question what a higher rated player is thinking?
"
30,1,3,Qxd4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/3q4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',And by move 5 the queens come off the board.
31,1,4,Bb5,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B6/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Protecting d4 by pinning the knight. A lot of beginners who play like this miss the mistake of allowing white to push the pawn and being down material.
32,1,5,Nge7,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/1B6/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',But that's not me. A seasoned veteran of the game myself I stop the pawn advance protect my knight at the cost of blocking my bishop on f8. 
33,1,6,Bg4,b'r3kb1r/1pp1nppp/p1n5/8/B2P2b1/8/PP2NPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Alternative: 9...b5?! 10. Bb3 Nf5 11. Be3 Bb4+ 12. Nbc3 Na5 13. Bd5 c6. I don't like this variation though as this at least gives me the option to castle if I feel the need to go queenside.
34,1,7,Rd8,b'3rkb1r/1pp1nppp/p1n5/8/B2P2b1/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',?! - I considered castling but looking down the line I think this was the better option. Alternative: 10...O-O-O 11. Bb3 Bh5 12. Be3 Bg6 13. O-O Na5 14. Bd1 Bd3 15. a3 looks playable but I felt I could adequately protect my king without castling.
35,1,8,1Bb3,b'3rkb1r/1pp1nppp/p1n5/8/3P2b1/1BN5/PP2NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',?! - Attacking f7 since I chose not to castle but this move gave me an idea.
36,1,9,Nf5,b'3rkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/5n2/3P4/1B6/PP2NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',Putting as much pressure as possible on d4.
37,1,10,1O-O,b'3rkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/5n2/3P4/1B6/PP2NPPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',?! - An interesting choice by white. Allowing my attack and electing to activate his rook instead.
38,1,11,1Nxd4,b'3rkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/8/3N4/1B6/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b k -',White elects to accept to open the e-file and attack my king.
39,1,12,1axb3,b'3rk2r/1pp1bppp/p7/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b k -',Simplifying the position even further. Being up a pawn and doubled pawns in this position seems to benefit me to trade. 
40,1,13,1Rd7,b'4k2r/1pprbppp/p7/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w k -',Protecting both my bishop and c7 squares. After this move white pondered his next move for about 10 minutes.
41,1,14,1Rad1,b'4k2r/1pprbppp/p7/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 b k -',...Before deciding to just trade off my rook.
42,1,15,1Rxd1,b'4k2r/1pp1bppp/p7/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/3R2K1 b k -',A move I accept given I am up a pawn and he has a doubled pawn. But now I think about my next move. Bd6? evens the board out as white will win his pawn back and put his rook in great position to gain more space.
43,1,16,1c6,b'4k2r/1p2bppp/p1p5/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/3R2K1 w k -',So I instead weaken my pawn structure to save c7. Though since I have not castled defending against the open file rook is not a problem.
44,1,17,2Re1,b'4k2r/1p2bppp/p1p5/8/5B2/1P6/1P3PPP/4R1K1 b k -',Once again white took his time in making his next move. He has to be careful or the position will slip further and further away.

My mini-tournament trying to sort out the Ruy Lopez. With no offense to my opponent but the guy is a renowned snail and is on my ignore list where snails wind up. Not sure when this will wrap up but lets get on with it. The opening is set up to move three. E5.
126,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',E4.
127,4,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Knight to F3. Seems like 9 out of 10 times at GK people with move pawn to D6 now (the Philidor Defense?) followed by the boring bishop to G4 then trading off a knight for bishop about 5 moves into the game. I really deplore that  line and wanted to explore something else. 
128,4,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Knight to C6.
129,4,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bishop to B5 setting up the Ruy Lopez and demanding a response from black (me). 
130,4,5,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I read that this called the Morphy response. I don't know. It is direct and agrresive and forces white to do something. I would do bishop to A4 and eventually to B3. 
131,4,6,Bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"Most people do this exchange variation. Though pawns get doubled it does not hurt black all that much. But is still that ""trade a bishop for a knight"" strategy that leads to more boring games I think. "
132,4,7,dxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I have found that using this pawn is better than using the B7 pawn to capture the pesky bishop. White here will usually capture the pawn but it lead to a attack from the black queen where material is recaptured.

135,4,10,Ng4,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3qP1N1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The usual response here is knight back to F3 queen takes pawn and then a queen trade off with white losing castling rights. His move to G4 takes us out of the database six moves into the game. 
136,4,11,Qxe4+,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/4q1N1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I can see he is trying to avoid the queen trade off. 
137,4,12,Ne3,b'r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/4q3/4N3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This not too bad. The pawn on G2 is protected though I often do not seize that pawn as it can just free up the rook later in the game. It is considered a poisoned pawn in some situations (like the B2 pawn) and should be seized with caution. But I will take it if the situation benefits me.  
138,4,13,Bc5,b'r1b1k1nr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/2b5/4q3/4N3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I do not know if I like this move really. I do not analyze moves too long and play too many games to think clearly (between GK and another site I am a member at I have 60 to 70 games going on simultaneously). If I spend one minute on a move it is the exception. Not the same with my opponent (though I do not think snails spend days and days analyzing moves. They drag out a game hoping for a time out or resignation from their burned out opponent).  It does not seem to be a terrible move but I have a bad feeling and am waiting and will have to wait another 3 or 4 days for Mr. Slingsnail with anxiety to see what he will do. 
139,4,14,Qxe3+,b'r1b1k1nr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/8/4qP2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',"Okay this all seems like it could end up into an interesting game. But what happens is I just cannot take this snail's super slow pace and I resign the game and add him to my ignore list. It just went on too long from the last time I added a note to this one. I sent him a sarcastic congratulatory note and to my surprise he actually had this game analyzed! Why would he need to do that but he must have been fascinated with something. I was not. An average game wherein my gimpish opponent waited until the last hour or two to make his moves. Too boring and dull and I am not addicted to the almighty ""rating pints"" and freed myself from the burden. Again congratulations o' slithering one. "

162,6,7,Be2,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I give the knight more protection with this move. True the g2 pawn already protected the knight but it's best to be on the safe side here. Besides I was getting ready to castle. If I instead played 6. h3 Bxf3 7.xf3 a door would be opened to my king if I castled king-side so no matter what he played next the outcome would not be negative for white.

182,6,27,2h5,b'r2q3k/pp2r3/3p2p1/3Pp2p/2Pp1pBb/P2P3P/1PQ2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now he forces me to pull it back further.
183,6,28,Re8,b'r2qr2k/pp6/3p2p1/3Pp2p/2Pp1p1b/P2P1B1P/1PQ2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',I don't think he was trying to get his rook in a certain position.

191,6,36,3Kh1,b'2r2qrk/1p6/3p1b2/p2P2pp/P1PpBp2/1P1P1P2/2Q5/R5RK b - -',When I'm not sure what other moves to make I move my king into a corner. Maybe not the best thing to do.

194,6,39,3Bxc8,b'2B2qrk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P2p1/P1Pp1p1p/1P1P1P2/R1Q5/6RK b - -',So the rook goes as expected.

196,6,41,3Qh3+,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P2R1/P1Pp1p1p/1P1P1P1q/R1Q5/7K w - -',I did not see that coming. White's f3 pawn is gone.
197,6,42,3Qh2,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P2R1/P1Pp1p1p/1P1P1P1q/R6Q/7K b - -',Unless black wants to trade queens.
198,6,43,3Qxf3+,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P2R1/P1Pp1p1p/1P1P1q2/R6Q/7K w - -',And he doesn't. White's advantage shrinks a little.
199,6,44,h3,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P4/P1Pp1p2/1P1P1q1p/R5RQ/7K w - -',This is a big issue or so I thought but I didn't realize that it wasn't at the time...
200,6,45,4Raf2,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P4/P1Pp1p2/1P1P1q1p/5RRQ/7K b - -',What I didn't realize though was how all the pieces were lined up and how each were playing their part. I didn't realize at the time how white's queen was lined up to black's king. Thus the only piece standing in between the two was the h3 pawn therefore it could not attack the g2 rook. If the black king wasn't where it is now like maybe f8 moving the other rook would of done no good for then 40. xg2+ 41. Rxg2 Qxd3 likely would of occurred. Now though black now has to save his queen due to the move just made here.
201,6,46,4Qh5,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P3q/P1Pp1p2/1P1P3p/5RRQ/7K w - -',40. Qxd3? I was expecting that but this move is probably much better. Now that black's queen protects his king the h3 pawn can attack the g2 rook but by now I had seen everything unfolding.
202,6,47,4Rg1,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P3q/P1Pp1p2/1P1P3p/5R1Q/6RK b - -',I save the rook.
203,6,48,4f3,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P3q/P1Pp4/1P1P1p1p/5R1Q/6RK w - -',I would of attacked that pawn but he moved it to f3 thus it was protected by his queen so attacking it was currently not an option.
204,6,49,4Rg3,b'6rk/6b1/1p1p4/p2P3q/P1Pp4/1P1P1pRp/5R1Q/7K b - -',Interesting scenario...
205,6,50,4Be5,b'6rk/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1pRp/5R1Q/7K w - -',Even more interesting now...
206,6,51,4Rxg8+,b'6Rk/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1p1p/5R1Q/7K b - -',...and I blew it! Yes this move will result in an even trade and it saves white's queen but instead I should of played this sequence: 43. Rxh3 Bxh2 44. Rxh5+ Kg7 45. Kxh2. This sequence would of left white with a sizable advantage. I panicked though when I saw both my queen and rook were in danger. I didn't really blow it but I missed an opportunity. 
207,6,52,4Qg1+,b'6k1/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1p1p/5R2/6QK b - -',I may have missed that opportunity but I have another to take the f3 and h3 pawns.
208,6,53,4Qf1,b'5k2/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1p1p/5R2/5Q1K b - -',I go for the f3 pawn first.
209,6,54,4Ke8,b'4k3/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1p1p/5R2/5Q1K w - -',There isn't anything black can do to save it.
210,6,55,4Rxf3,b'4k3/8/1p1p4/p2Pb2q/P1Pp4/1P1P1R1p/8/5Q1K b - -',The h3 pawn is next.
211,6,56,4Qh6,b'4k3/8/1p1p3q/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P1R1p/8/5Q1K w - -',Again there is nothing black can do to save it.
212,6,57,Qf6,b'4k3/8/1p1p1q2/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/5Q1K w - -',Obviously black wants to trade queens.
213,6,58,4Qg2,b'4k3/8/1p1p1q2/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/6Q1/7K b - -',I still felt though I can make good use out of my queen.
214,6,59,4Qg7,b'4k3/6q1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/6Q1/7K w - -',Again he goes for trade.
215,6,60,4Qf1,b'4k3/6q1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/5Q1K b - -',Again I resist.
216,6,61,4Kd7,b'8/3k2q1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/5Q1K w - -',Black realizes I didn't feel like trading.
217,6,62,5Qf2,b'8/3k2q1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/5Q2/7K b - -',I'm not sure what moves to make now.
218,6,63,5Qg1,b'2k5/6q1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/6QK b - -',It dawned on me! There was oppurtunity for the win but I realized that for it to work black's queen had to disappear so after resisting I would now give black what he wanted.
219,6,64,5Kxg1,b'2k5/8/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/6K1 b - -',All according to plan. White's and back's pawns are at a standstill Black's bishop cannot steal any of white's pawns for the bishop only runs on black squares and all the white pawns are on white spaces so now it's time to get the king and the rook involved.
220,6,65,5Kf3,b'4k3/8/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P1K1R/8/8 b - -',The bishop is a slight hurdle but it can be passed around easily.
221,6,66,5Kf7,b'8/5k2/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P1K1R/8/8 w - -',Black is trying to evade the inevitable by getting his king out of the a-e spaces. He may be hoping I make a mistake or cause him to go into a dead position (draw). I planned though to find a way to win one way or another.
222,6,67,Kg7,b'8/6k1/1p1p4/p2Pb3/P1Pp2K1/1P1P3R/8/8 w - -',A bit surprised he didn't play Kg6 instead.
223,6,68,5Kf5,b'8/6k1/1p1p4/p2PbK2/P1Pp4/1P1P3R/8/8 b - -',I'm doing my best to keep my king off of the black spaces to avoid check from the bishop.
224,6,69,5Rh7+,b'8/5k1R/1p1p4/p2PbK2/P1Pp4/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',Now I get the rook involved.
225,6,70,5Kg6,b'6k1/7R/1p1p2K1/p2Pb3/P1Pp4/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',I protect the rook and bring my king in closer.
226,6,71,5Rb7,b'6k1/1R6/1p1p2K1/p2P4/P1Pp1b2/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',Checkmate was possible here but I already knew that back saw it coming.
227,6,72,5Kf8,b'5k2/1R6/1p1p2K1/p2P4/P1Pp1b2/1P1P4/8/8 w - -',As expected checkmate is no longer immediately imminent. 
228,6,73,6Kf6,b'5k2/1R6/1p1p1K2/p2P4/P1Pp1b2/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',I keep trying but I moved my king on a black space...

231,6,76,6Kf5,b'1R6/4k3/1p1p4/p2P1K2/P1Pp4/1P1P2b1/8/8 b - -',I wanted to drive the king to a8 or a6 but black could head in the opposite direction here. 
232,6,77,6Kd7,b'1R6/3k4/1p1p4/p2P1K2/P1Pp4/1P1P2b1/8/8 w - -',Fortunately for white he went white's way.
233,6,78,6Kf6,b'1R6/3k4/1p1p1K2/p2P4/P1Pp4/1P1P2b1/8/8 b - -',Now black is in trouble.
234,6,79,6Be1,b'1R6/3k4/1p1p1K2/p2P4/P1Pp4/1P1P4/8/4b3 w - -',Black tries to evade the inevitable. I'm surprised black didn't play Bh4+. Getting the bishop involved was better than letting it run away.
235,6,80,6Re8,b'4R3/2k2K2/1p1p4/p2P4/P1Pp4/1P1P4/8/4b3 b - -',Of course I protect the rook.
236,6,81,6Bb4,b'4R3/2k2K2/1p1p4/p2P4/PbPp4/1P1P4/8/8 w - -',? This gives no help to black at all. 
237,6,82,6Ke7,b'4R3/2k1K3/1p1p4/p2P4/PbPp4/1P1P4/8/8 b - -',Checkmate is inevitable no matter what black does now. Mate in 3

This move creates an outpost on g3 which proves to be a formidable infiltration square.

This is just poor calculation. The game could have gone on for another 20 moves...white is still a pawn up so if the material is traded down to nothing I am theoretically on the losing side. 

Still I am well placed if I may say so - the bishop is using the outpost I created 28 moves ago- the rook owns the g file - the queen owns the h file - and even the poor little d7 bishop (who only moved once in a 46 move game) is doing his part to block the mean lady from squeezing out some kind of draw.

448,13,6,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White plays an aggressive move to threaten the queen check (Qh5). I could play g6 to block it but I am looking for white to play the check so I play along with the terrible-looking pawn-grab instead. This allows white to develop the 'winning' position.
449,13,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3pP3/3n4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',OK Knight takes pawn looks suicidal and breaks all the rules but bear with me....

451,13,9,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5pp1/3pP2Q/3n4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',I block with the pawn well aware that white will now take the pawn.

457,13,15,Qd7,b'r1b1kbnQ/pppqp3/5pp1/3pP3/8/8/PPn2PPP/RNBK2NR w q -',My plan here is to let the white king take my knight in order to bring it into range of my attack. Putting my queen on d2 allows me to develop quickly.

459,13,17,Qg4,b'r1b1kbnQ/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR w q -',It might seem better to play Qf5+ but my analysis shows that this is non-optimum. Putting my queen on g4 serves two purposes - firstly she is now ready to swing into action in the attack and secondly she is watching the g6 pawn which after white takes on g8 is a natural target for the white queen.
460,13,18,1Qxg8,b'r1b1kbQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR b q -',Sure enough white takes probably sensing no great danger at this point. Now it is time to bring my bishop into the counter-attack...
461,13,19,1Bf5+,b'r3kbQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pPb2/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR w q -',White has several options but analysis indicates they all lead to a similar outcome.
462,13,20,1Kd2,b'r3kbQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pPb2/6q1/8/PP1K1PPP/RNB3NR b q -',Kd2 is a reasonable choice from the available options....certainly not the worst.
463,13,21,1O-O-O,b'2kr1bQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pPb2/6q1/8/PP1K1PPP/RNB3NR w - -',Castling might seem to reduce attacking tempo but not so. Firstly it means I no longer need to worry about the white queen and secondly it brings my rook into the action. It also delivers the obvious threat on the white queen which demands an immediate response from white.
464,13,22,1Qh7,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/6q1/8/PP1K1PPP/RNB3NR b - -',White spots the threat and moves his queen to safety.
465,13,23,1Qg5+,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPbq1/8/8/PP1K1PPP/RNB3NR w - -',I deliver this check to force the king to either come more into the open or retreat to d1.
466,13,24,1Kd1,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPbq1/8/8/PP3PPP/RNBK2NR b - -',White retreats which is the best response. 
467,13,25,1Qxg2,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/8/8/PP3PqP/RNBK2NR w - -',I now move my queen so that white's rook is at my mercy.
468,13,26,1Ne2,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/8/8/PP2NPqP/RNBK3R b - -',White plays a good response but the rook is dead-meat.
469,13,27,1Qxh1+,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/8/8/PP2NP1P/RNBK3q w - -',I take-off the rook 
470,13,28,1Kd2,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/8/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB4q b - -',White plays the forced move.
471,13,29,1Qf1,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p2Q/5pp1/3pPb2/8/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 w - -',Not an obvious move but it has advantages. It threatens f2 keeps the threat on c1 & e2 and blocks the retreat of white king to the 1 rank.
472,13,30,1Qh4,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pPb2/7Q/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 b - -',White now brings his queen back into a position where it can help in the defence. This is actually a mistake - much better to have played Nc3 I think....
473,13,31,1d4,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p3/5pp1/4Pb2/3p3Q/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 w - -',Now it is time to play my master-strategy. This pawn is the key to exploiting my position and turning the position into a decisive one.
474,13,32,1Qf4,b'2kr1b2/ppp1p3/5pp1/4Pb2/3p1Q2/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 b - -',Not sure about this move from white - but it allows me to play a rather nice tactical sacrifice.
475,13,33,1Bh6,b'2kr4/ppp1p3/5ppb/4Pb2/3p1Q2/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 w - -',White must take or accept the loss of the queen.
476,13,34,1Qxh6,b'2kr4/ppp1p3/5ppQ/4Pb2/3p4/8/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 b - -',So white takes as indicated...
477,13,35,1d3,b'2kr4/ppp1p3/5ppQ/4Pb2/8/3p4/PP1KNP1P/RNB2q2 w - -',I push the passed pawn and the danger is now apparent. White should accept the loss of the Knight and play Kc3 - but whatever white does at this point I think black has a decisive advantage and should go on to win quite easily despite the material deficit.
478,13,36,1Ng3,b'2kr4/ppp1p3/5ppQ/4Pb2/8/3p2N1/PP1K1P1P/RNB2q2 b - -',White plays the knight fork which looks OK but will lead to problems quickly....

481,13,39,2Qc2+,b'2kr4/ppp1p3/5ppQ/4Pb2/8/2Kp2N1/PPq4P/RNB5 w - -',But that pesky pawn gives the Queen the chance to get up close and personal.....

One of the perennial problems with this gambit line for black is white's space advantage in the centre which is important I think to challenge at every opportunity.

762,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am presenting this miniature game as an example of a very aggressive continuation to the King's Knight Gambit classical variation (1.e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5) for those seeking perhaps an alternative to the more commonly played Kieseritzsky and Allgaiers gambits. This opening however is not for the faint of heart. My interest in it was piqued after GM Nakamura played it against GM Andreikin in a blitz game defeating him. This is one of my own excursions with it against a 1700 plus player.     
763,23,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',King's Knight Gambit. Once you play this move you'll most commonly see the Fischer Defense (3..d6) the Schallop Defense (3..Nf6) or the Cunningham (3..d7). In this game my opponent played the still-popular classical variation (3..g5).

Since most players below master level hardly ever encounter this gambit they don't know the correct lines of defense and very soon find themselves in trouble.   
766,23,4,gxf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5p2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',An irresistible capture!

It's tempting at this point to push d4 but that would only drive the queen back to an f7 defensive position. The correct move order here is essential! One more big sacrifice is coming - in the spirit of Paul Morphy!

The purpose of this sacrifice is twofold: to keep the king on the open board by destroying any hopes of castling and also to put him on f7 where the possibility of advantageous combinations pins skewers and deadly discovery checks will arise.       
771,23,9,Kxf7,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/4q3/5p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Refusing the bishop sacrifice here isn't an option for black as far as I can tell. White's bishop will soon take on f4 and potentially give rise to torturous pins along the d8-h4 diagonal. And the black queen herself will be under the incessant threat of forks and discoveries. 
772,23,10,d4,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/4q3/3P1p2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - d3',The idea of this pawn sac is that after 9..Qxd4 the bishop comes to d3 checking the queen with immunity from capture. White's tempo will be maintained and the black queen will have to move yet again at the expense of minor piece development. The position for black is growing more and more precarious.
773,23,11,Qf5,b'rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/5q2/3P1p2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',At this point I think my opponent was beginning to realize the danger he was getting into and stopped taking the offered material. Qf5 is actually the best move here - the refuting move. 
774,23,12,Bh6,b'rnb3nr/pppp1k1p/7b/5q2/3P1B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',Black would gladly exchange bishops and queens here but white holds all the cards and is now poised to launch multiple attacks on black's stranded king. It's showtime!   
775,23,13,1d5,b'rnb3nr/pppp1k1p/4q2b/3P4/5B2/1Q6/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - -',Black probably now wishes he had eliminated this pawn. The queen has to move again but her safety options are quickly running out. Note the impending rook and queen discoveries on f1 and b3 are crushing. 
776,23,14,1Qb6+,b'rnb3nr/pppp1k1p/1q5b/3P4/5B2/1Q6/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',This move presupposes a forced exchange of queens but white already has too many weapons at his disposal.

I never play it as black myself.  I am not sure what the objectives are really but it always evolves into a board setup I do not like. Where black and white's pieces are stuck behind their pawns too long and a big open battle field sits empty between the two sides. Oh well. It seems a popular reply to E4 at GK so I am a little used to it and handle well these days winning most games that start in this position according to my personal database. 
780,24,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I think this is the standard way to go.

782,24,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Knight to C3. This move forces his queen to do something letting her know she is not welcome to roost on D5 as she pleases. It also develops a piece on white's side. The book responses tend to be queen back to her station on D8 or moving to A5 and establishing a formidable outpost for a possible flanking attack later. 
783,24,5,Qe6+,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But he does what 75% of players do in this position and he checks the king. Why? They seem like they cannot resist that early check either on E6 or E5. In my early games I did get myself tied up with the queen jumping around my king side and it can get messy and I lost a few early games with this one.   But with a little experience you will find that this usually this works against black since he seems to try to win the game with a queen alone. As he jumps around trying to check you or get the G2 pawn you are developing pieces and often corralling his queen little by little. White just needs to take a breath and relax and let it play out. 
784,24,6,Be2,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Bishop to E2. This works better I think than putting your knight on E2. A queen trade only leads to a long and boring game from the get go. Even if I win I have won a long and boring game and there is little thrill. He probably wants a queen trade off but I am not interested. Players who rush in early with queen attacks tend to run out of steam and I will move my lady out when the time is right. 
785,24,7,b5,b'rnb1kbnr/p1p1pppp/4q3/1p6/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq b6',I do not know what is up here. Maybe he was thinking that because my LS bishop was pinned he could advance that pawn. Maybe he wants to attack the G2 square with his bishop but pawn to B6 would have worked better for that. I hesitated thinking it was sort of trap but decide it was a blunder.

Seems he may be attacking the LS bishop on E2 with his bishop and queen? Not sure. It is double guarded anyway by my queen and knight. Or he got antsy because he just lost a piece and wants to be aggressive and takes the "" in your face"" approach. I don't know but I have found a queen loss is common for black with the Scandinavian if he is not cautious and patient. His best move was to move his queen back to protect the vulnerable C7 square. But sometimes people see this as ""retreating"" and giving up gained (though worthless) territory. "

I hope to go to H5 with my queen (which I have held off on for a bit as well timed check is better than a wasted one where your opponent only strengthens his defense) and check. I have only moved my queen once in the game so far. She seems inactive but she is like a predatory cheetah waiting to pounce at the right moment. And that moment has come. Food. His only move will be rook to F7 as F8 is now taken by the rook then my rook to D8 and checkmate. Will it work out? Will he see the set up? We have to just wait a bit and see. There is always a bit of excitement and worry at these moments. My opponent is on line now and I set up conditionals moves to see if I can predict his moves now.

No. He fights all this way and resigns. To be frank I hate that and it leads me to think that players in his position may actually think they have a chance of winning or stalemating a game like this. It is possible of course but not likely. Can at least let the other guy have the mate but the only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore winner. So an interesting game and an interesting way to annotate it. "

Afterall I still need to learn more about the Caro Kann I decide to play what I'm comfortable with at this point because I've been told that there's nothing really wrong with doing that.  It's just that you have to be careful because the opponent can get an advantage if he finds an opportunity to gain tempii.  But what I kept in mind is that since this move puts him in check there's no way that he can do that.  And by doing this I thought that I gained tempii instead.  And we are going into variations that I'm predicting but I was wrong about one thing it doesn't lose tempo for black either.
911,29,6,Bd7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/5n2/1B1p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',As anticipated.  And as you're about to witness this move is going to lead to an exchange of B's which I also predicted.

And as it turns out Mr. Stockel is dead on.  Strong bishop in general is the color.  Meaning that if you're white then the LSB is the strong piece.  If however you're black then the DSB is the strong piece.  So I said  That's not good. I've always had trouble determining what minor piece is weak or strong. That still remains one of my weak areas in chess. For example I thought that I just took your strong bishop.  In addition the idea was for you to take so that I could castle.  This is what I had planned for two moves so since 5.Bb5!.
914,29,9,e6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So then I asked you understand why I took. The plan was to place you in check force an exchange and then castle. Now little did I realize that what I took was a weak piece. But I have trouble knowing how to tell from a weak V. a strong minor piece. I realize that this is something for me work on in terms of being able to determine that.

916,29,11,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Having said that the idea behind this move was for wolfgang to get another piece out.  By doing so he can and will castle on his next move.

918,29,13,h6,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/3p2B1/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I only understand the logic behind this too well.  The idea being to chase the B back or force an exchange.  But given the context clues I believe that a B is worth more then a N.  Therefore I'm not going to take but rather retreat on the most common outpost for this kind of position.
919,29,14,a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/3P3B/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! I don't know why he played this.  Afterall it's not the Sicilian Defense and I only see this move with that defense.  I mean probably to prevent my N from reaching b4.  But because of that I decided to mark this move as dubious because there's no need to worry about it.  This time it's not a threat and my intention was not to play 12.Nb5.
920,29,15,1Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/3pN3/3P3B/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This however was my intention.  Given that f6 is his weak N we now know that d7 as it turns out is his strong N.  So my goal is to exchange by getting rid of his strong N by exchanging and then some.   Which is about to happen.  Therefore I now feel that this time white has just equalized and with best play might even have a slight edge.
921,29,16,Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbpp1/p3p2p/3pP3/7B/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is why.  After playing 13.dxe5 black was just forced to retreat which is how I just gained tempii.  And I am going to use that needed time to force another exchange.
922,29,17,1Qd4,b'r4rk1/1p1nqpp1/p3p2p/3pP3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So this move proves that I have a plan.  As we will see shortly it's the same plan that black has ironically.

But had I played 18.Rd3 with the idea being that I'd be able to double on with Rd1 those rooks can do a lot of damage such as mate.

In it he said ""In it he said ""White has 2 weak squares which black is targeting. c2 and e5.General plan doble rooks c file. Push b pawn to soften up Q-side look for opportunity if presents to play Re4 and win e5 pawn.""

930,29,25,2d4,b'6k1/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/4P3/1qrp4/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/1R4K1 w - -',So black takes advantage of my weakness by forking my N and Q.

The idea behind this is that if he takes with 21...dxe3 I'll recapture with 22.axb4 and everything is even.  But as we know there's always more to a story then meets the eye.

So I don't what that decision accomplishes.  But this time I'm not marking it as pointless because I realize later on that no matter what he did this for a very good reason.  And this choice is going to cause a lot of damage for white in some way.
933,29,28,2Qd3,b'6k1/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2q1P3/2rp4/P1NQ4/1PP2PPP/1R4K1 b - -',"?? Since my Q is now attacked I had to retreat in some way.  However this move is the losing blunder because it loses a pawn and a piece.  Plus it gives black that needed time to set up ""a successful mating corridor"" as jstevens1 puts it.   Therefore best was 22.Qe3."
934,29,29,2Qd2,b'6k1/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2q1n3/2rp4/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Since I'm attacked I had to retreat again.  But this diagram proves that tempii is actually critical.  And no matter how you slice it black wins a free piece when we are done exchanging.

To make matters worse he was very close to promoting a pawn.  However he took another pawn which is what sealed his fate as it enabled me to pull a swindle.  I thought the same thing happened in that black underestimated white and that this move was a mate in one.  What I forgot however is that he moved his h pawn so instead of this being a mate he can and does escape with 26...Kh7.
936,29,31,2g3,b'3Q4/1R3ppk/p3p2p/2q1n3/8/P5P1/2r2P1P/6K1 b - -',Now I have to be careful or he will get the back rank mate on me.  What I am unaware of however is that the damage has already been done.  And black has a won game with no way around it this time.
