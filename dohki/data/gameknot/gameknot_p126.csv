0,0,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',My friend who hasn't played chess for a while decided not to play ...c5 is usual response so this was new territory for us.
1,0,1,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',g6 is more common and so I was thinking of play a Botvinnik type formation but with this I decided to look for a d4 break.
2,0,2,e3,b'r2qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1pn5/4p3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Planning Ne2 O-O and d4
3,0,3,d5,b'r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1pn2n2/3pp3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',My friend plays this to stop my d4 break. However at first I thought this was a blunder.
4,0,4,Qb3,b'r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/1n6/1QN1P1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',?!
5,0,5,Kf1,b'r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/8/1QNnP1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B2K1R b kq -',This is where the complications will begin. I expected Nc5 however blacks move is interesting.
6,0,6,e4,b'r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p3n2/3P4/4p3/1QNnP1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B2K1R w kq -',!? Black plays e4 protecting the knight however there are some complications: Nxe4 (Nxe5? Qxd3 is what my friend played to start with however I let him take it back) Nxe4 Bxe4 Nc5 Qc2 Bxe4 (Or Qxe4) and black is better due to a safer king however he is a pawn down but I beleive he has compensation. White's weak king and light squares as well as some troublesome development of the DSB. So maybe rather than Bxe4 white Plays Qxe3 Nf6 with pressure on the d-pawn. White can play e4 or Nc3 but not Nf4 due to g5 and kicking the Knight and dropping the d-pawn. This is probably better for white (I like Nc3) because he has two pawns for his bad king however he needs to exchange pieces and get to an endgame to make advantage of this.
7,0,7,1Qc2,b'2kr1b1r/pbp2ppp/1p3q2/3P4/8/4P1P1/PPQPNPBP/2R2K1R b - -',White is pressuring the q-side threatening mate. Now Black played Rd7 to start with however Bh3 pins the rook and wins the exchange so my friend took it back.
8,0,8,1Nd4,b'2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1p1b1q2/3P4/3N4/4P1P1/PPQP1PBP/2R2K1R b - -',Wanting to play Bb5 to kick the DSB or jump into c6.
9,0,9,1Ba6+,b'2kr3r/p1p2ppp/bp1b1q2/3P4/3N4/4P1P1/PPQP1PBP/2R2K1R w - -',I prefer a6 however This is ok.
10,0,10,Rhe8,b'2krr3/p1p2ppp/bp1b1q2/3P4/3N4/4P1P1/PPQP1PBP/2R1K2R w - -',Threatening Qxd4
11,0,11,1Bh3+,b'2krr3/p1p2ppp/bp1b1q2/3P4/3N4/4P1PB/PPQP1P1P/2R1K2R b - -',To start with my opponent played Kb8 then I played Nc6+ and he resigned (we were nearly out of time) however he then saw he could have played Kb7 but we were out of time so we didn't continue.
12,0,12,1Kb7,b'3rr3/pkp2ppp/bp1b1q2/3P4/3N4/4P1PB/PPQP1P1P/2R1K2R w - -',However now I will try and analyse this. All comments welcome.
13,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My favorite opening the King's Pawn Play.
14,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He responds with the Nimovitz defense but I do not see this too often.
15,1,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I usually consider this ? as it is pushing a pawn.  However this was ! because it forces the knight to retreat.  That is because the knight can become dangerous in this position since it has a potential to attack powerful pieces based on my AP analysis.
16,1,3,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/4P3/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I do not know why he made that move instead of Ng8 because he is not going to castle. 
17,1,4,Qe2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/4P3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I chose that candidate because his knight is becoming more powerful in this position.  However this move was ? because I brought my queen out way too early.  Therefore Bd3 would have been better as it would have also chased the knight away.
18,1,5,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq d6',I do not why he made this move.
19,1,6,Qb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/1Q1pP3/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I respond by placing him in check immediately and this was based on my KKQ assessment.  However this move was ?.  
20,1,7,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/1Q1pP3/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',That is because I just wasted a move since he is threatening to capture my queen with cxb5. 
21,1,8,Qb3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/4n3/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Therefore I am now forced to retreat my queen.
22,1,9,f6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p2p2/3pP3/4n3/1Q6/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',He chose this candidate to force an exchange and that will work when 6.exf6 exf6 are played.
23,1,10,Qd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3p4/4n3/3Q4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',This gives me a tactical advantage because his queen is now blocked.   
24,1,11,Qd7,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1q2pp/2p2p2/3p4/4n3/3Q4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',He made this move to free his queen.
25,1,12,Qe3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1q2pp/2p2p2/3p4/4n3/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I chose this candidate based on my KKQ assessment.  If I had left my queen on d3 he would have played Nc5 and threatened to capture my queen with Nxd3.  I did not want to deal with that threat.
26,1,13,Qg4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3p4/4n1q1/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I do not why he made this move but this will benefit me. 
27,1,14,f3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3p4/4n1q1/4QP2/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',That is because I used an AP assessment to play a powerful fork between his knight and queen.
28,1,15,Qf5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3p1q2/4n3/4QP2/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',In this position he was forced to retreat his queen so I will be ahead by two points.  That is because his knight will be exchanged for my pawn when 10.fxe4 dxe4 are played.
29,1,16,1Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/5q2/4p3/2N1Q3/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I decided to bring out one of my knights based on the AP assessment.  That is because I am now threatening to capture his free e pawn with Nxe4 in this position.  If this happens he will not be able to recapture my knight with Qxe4 or he will loose the queen because I will respond with Qxe4. 
30,1,17,1Bc5,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/2p2p2/2b2q2/4p3/2N1Q3/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',As a result he is now threatening to capture my queen with Bxe3.
31,1,18,1Qg3,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/2p2p2/2b2q2/4p3/2N3Q1/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Therefore I am forced to retreat my queen.  In exchange I now threaten to capture his free g pawn.
32,1,19,1g5,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p2p2/2b2qp1/4p3/2N3Q1/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq g6',Consequently he is now forced to protect his g pawn and his rook.
33,1,20,1d3,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p2p2/2b2qp1/4p3/2NP2Q1/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I chose this candidate because it will force an exchange and attack his queen after the exchange when exd3 followed by Bxd3 are played.  This was also based on my AP assessment.
34,1,21,Qe6+,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1qp2/2b3p1/8/2NB2Q1/PPP3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',As a result he protects his queen by placing me in check.
35,1,22,1Nge2,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1qp2/2b3p1/8/2NB2Q1/PPP1N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',However that does not bother me because I simply respond by bringing out my other knight.
36,1,23,1f5,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1q3/2b2pp1/8/2NB2Q1/PPP1N1PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I do not know why made this move because I was not going to place him in check due to his h pawn.
37,1,24,1a3,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1q3/2b2pp1/8/P1NB2Q1/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',If I did not move my a pawn he would have been able to pin my knight on c3 and I did not want that to happen.  This threat was also based on my AP assessment. 
38,1,25,1f4,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1q3/2b3p1/5p2/P1NB2Q1/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',He chose this candidate because he wants to capture my queen on g3.
39,1,26,1Qf3,b'rnb1k2r/pp5p/2p1q3/2b3p1/5p2/P1NB1Q2/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',"I could have played Qh3 and forced a queen exchanged with Qxh3 followed by gxh3 but I did not want do that because I would then have two h pawns.  I felt that it would put me at a structural disadvantage because my rooks would not connected here.  Therefore I respond by retreating my queen and it was 
! in my opinion.  In fact I think that this was my best candidate move based on the potential KKQ and AP in this position."
40,1,27,1Na6,b'r1b1k2r/pp5p/n1p1q3/2b3p1/5p2/P1NB1Q2/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',"I do not know why he made that move but ""a knight on the rim is grim"" in general. "
41,1,28,1Qh5+,b'r1b1k2r/pp5p/n1p1q3/2b3pQ/5p2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Based on my KKQ and AP analysis I decided to place him in check because it is serious instead of a mere nuisance in this position.  That is because I will win his free g pawn after he moves his king.
42,1,29,1Kf8,b'r1b2k1r/pp5p/n1p1q3/2b3pQ/5p2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now he is forced to move his king.
43,1,30,1Qxg5,b'r1b2k1r/pp5p/n1p1q3/2b3Q1/5p2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This is the free pawn that I had mentioned earlier.
44,1,31,1Qf7,b'r1b2k1r/pp3q1p/n1p5/2b3Q1/5p2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I do not know why chose that candidate because his rook was already protected by the queen.  In other words I could not have played Qf6.  However that does not bother because I will capture his f pawn based on the AP when Bxf4 is played.  In addition he cannot recapture the DSB or he will loose his queen and get placed in check because I will respond with Qxf4+.
45,1,32,h6,b'r1b2k1r/pp3q2/n1p4p/2b3Q1/5B2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',He made this move because he wants to capture my queen with hxg5 but I am not about to let that happen.
46,1,33,2Qd8+,b'r1bQ1k1r/pp3q2/n1p4p/2b5/5B2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Instead I respond by placing him in check based on my KKQ and possible AP.
47,1,34,2Kg7,b'r1bQ3r/pp3qk1/n1p4p/2b5/5B2/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',That is because he is now forced to move there or I will win his rook for free because I will play Qxh8 in this position.  
48,1,35,2Be5+,b'r1bQ3r/pp3qk1/n1p4p/2b1B3/8/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Therefore I assess another KKQ by placing him in check with my bishop.
49,1,36,2Qf6,b'r1bQ3r/pp4k1/n1p2q1p/2b1B3/8/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',He also could have played Kh8 but it does not matter where he moves because I now have an inevitable mating pattern against him and will successfully capture his queen in this position.  How did I reach this conclusion?  With my KKQ analysis. 
50,1,37,2Qxf6+,b'r1b4r/pp4k1/n1p2Q1p/2b1B3/8/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',He cannot recapture his queen.  Therefore he can play Kg8 or Kh7 but it does not matter at this point.
51,1,38,2Kg8,b'r1b3kr/pp6/n1p2Q1p/2b1B3/8/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',That is because I will immediately force a mate with Qg7#.   
52,1,39,2Qg7#,b'r1b3kr/pp4Q1/n1p4p/2b1B3/8/P1NB4/1PP1N1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',"I learned about the KKQ and AP assessments from a chess mentor.  This mentor also told me that it is only important to worry about ""serious checks"" not ""nuisance checks"" when analyzing the KKQ.  I am using these assessments more frequently and it is helping me to become better at chess."
53,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here my opponent begins by pushing up his rook. Yes his rook. Your eyes are really getting bad aren't they?
54,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I counterattack by using my bishop. (Just kidding! Its actually my knight!)
55,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This early mistake here will cost my enemy dearly. Taking his knight out early increases the chance of a left-mate-pin also commonly known as 'fmoodle-smong'. 
56,2,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here I have set up the 'donkey formation' a subtle but overhwelming opening in its own right. Few can defend against its brutal simplicity. 
57,2,4,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Another silly mistake here. Just silly. Silly silly silly. 
58,2,5,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here you can see the potential of triple-check. Checkity. 
59,2,6,Qh4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/2b1N3/2B1P2q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A fluid beautifully timed move. The pentagonal formation created by the bishop-hook is unmistakable. 
60,2,7,Bxe5,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4b3/2B1P2q/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A fork! (Or maybe a spoon I'm not quite sure...)
61,2,8,gxh4,b'rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4b3/2B1P2P/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Here white plays very badly... a rookie mistake that has ensured his own brutal demise. 
62,2,9,Bf6,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2b1n/8/2BPP2P/8/PPP2P1P/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"I learnt three things from this move:

1. Noodles are yummy. 2. I can't count. "
63,2,10,1Bxh6,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p4B/7Q/2BbP2P/8/PPP2P1P/RN3RK1 b kq -',Another mistake here. A meaningless tactic that will accomplish nothing. 
64,2,11,1Bxb2,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2p4B/7Q/2B1P2P/8/PbP2P1P/RN3RK1 w kq -',Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha *snort* ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! (also a spork)
65,2,12,1Bxb2,b'rnbkr3/pp1p1Q1p/2p5/8/2B1P2P/8/PBP2P1P/RN3RK1 b - -',You can see here how novice my opponent is. Imbecilic and featherbrained moves like these only serve to accentuate his inane and immaturity. It also opens up the right flank-fmoddle. Or something.

"
67,3,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I always move to e5 by force.
68,3,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',e6 blocks the c8 bishop moving on to the diagonal. 
69,3,2,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Normal structure but the knight blocks the black bishop even more

97,3,30,Ng7,b'6r1/p1B1bknB/b3p3/1N1pP2p/Pp6/3Q4/1PP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Good thing the knight's popped away and even better he's blocked the rook so at least I can do waht I planned.

100,3,33,2Rh8,b'5k1r/N1B1b1nB/b3p1Q1/3pP2p/Pp6/8/1PP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',And the knight couldn't move because Qxg8 was checkmate so much better from now on

105,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am annotating this game for a few key learning elements.  Although I wound up winning the game both allanshessw and I made several mistakes that warrant further investigation.

108,4,3,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Shoring up the e pawn and giving his bishop more options for development a solid move.
109,4,4,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Discretion being the better part of valor I protect my king to allow my rook to eventually get into the game on the e file.

111,4,6,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/2p1bppp/p1np4/1p2p3/3PP3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',In recent games I have taken to attacking the center early and often.  I like creating opportunities and you need to attack to do that.  This move allows my dark-squared bishop entrance into the game and also attacks the center. Moves that can accomplish more than one thing are always best.
112,4,7,exd4,b'r1bqk1nr/2p1bppp/p1np4/1p6/3pP3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"An alternative could have seen Black take with the knight (Nxd4) instead of this move.  The logical conclusion to that series would be
8.	Nxd4	exd4
9.	Bd5	Rb8
10.	Qxd4	

By taking here I now have an opportunity.  There is now no longer a pawn in front of his king.  My main goal now is to get my own e pawn out of the way so I can directly challenge his king."
113,4,8,Bd5,b'r1bqk1nr/2p1bppp/p1np4/1p1B4/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Now I move to bring my plan into effect.  Black has two potential responses here and only one of them is worth considering.
114,4,9,Bb7,b'r2qk1nr/1bp1bppp/p1np4/1p1B4/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This move is basically forced.  Had black chosen Bd7 Nxd4 will cause some problems.
115,4,10,Nxd4,b'r2qk1nr/1bp1bppp/p1np4/1p1B4/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The natural follow through.  As I see it Black has a few options here.  He can take my knight (Nxd4) Move the queen up to d7 (my favorite) or what he wound up doing.
116,4,11,Na5,b'r2qk1nr/1bp1bppp/p2p4/np1B4/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This move I think is a mistake.  It allows me to add some pressure onto him by my next move.  It does appear to be a good move on the surface and gave me some pause.  If I take his bishop on b7 with my own he can retake with his knight and while that puts his knight in a bad position it doesn't give me a lot of attack options.  I still need to see if I can get him to take my bishop so I can move my e pawn and get my rook into the game.
117,4,12,1Bd2,b'r2qk1nr/1bp1bppp/p2p4/np1B4/3NP3/8/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Putting pressure on his knight and continuing my development.

119,4,14,1exd5,b'r2qk1nr/2p1bppp/p2p4/np1P4/3N4/8/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Retaking is imperative here but it also allows me to bring my rook into the game.  As his knight is still under attack he has to either move it or defend it.    The best move from this position I think is the one he made.
120,4,15,1Nc4,b'r2qk1nr/2p1bppp/p2p4/1p1P4/2nN4/8/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Not only does this give his knight a good-looking post it also simultaneously attacks my bishop and b pawn.  
121,4,16,1Bc3,b'r2qk1nr/2p1bppp/p2p4/1p1P4/2nN4/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',To defend the b pawn and move my bishop out of harm's way.  So far we are even on exchanges but I have a significant attack angle on his king almost no matter what he does.
122,4,17,1Bf6,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p2p1b2/1p1P4/2nN4/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',This move surprised me a little bit as I anticipated him bringing his knight to the same square to allow him to move closer to castling and safety for his king.  However the post of his d pawn looks to be helpful.
123,4,18,1Re1+,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p2p1b2/1p1P4/2nN4/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',Building the pressure.
124,4,19,1Ne5,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p2p1b2/1p1Pn3/3N4/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',Black's best move here is to move his king to f8.  It will complicate his position as he will have to find an alternative way to get his rook into the game but this move opens him up to a nasty attack which I did not use because of tunnel vision.
125,4,20,1Nc6,b'r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1Np1b2/1p1Pn3/8/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',Time to wade in to dislodge the queen give my knight a nice post and also add additional pressure on the knight.

I was thinking that he would try to castle kingside giving me significant advantage against his knight which would come out to give his king.

130,4,25,1f6,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/p4p2/1p1PR3/8/8/PPP1QPPP/RN4K1 w kq -',This is a great response from Black and I congratulated him in game.  This move gives him the space to bring his king up to f7 and relieve the pressure on his knight.
131,4,26,1Re3,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/p4p2/1p1P4/8/4R3/PPP1QPPP/RN4K1 b kq -',I toyed around with the idea of Re6 for some time here but ultimately decided against it.  I like the extra protection of the f pawn and once he brings his king up it could complicate matters for me down the road with protection.  Better to avoid all of that and make a tactical retreat for the time being.
132,4,27,1Kf7,b'r6r/2pqnkpp/p4p2/1p1P4/8/4R3/PPP1QPPP/RN4K1 w - -',Giving his knight a chance to get back into the game.

134,4,29,2bxc4,b'r6r/2pqnkpp/p4p2/3P4/2p5/4R3/PP2QPPP/RN4K1 w - -',This move allows me two options.  One is a retake with my queen or bringing my knight out first.

140,4,35,2Qc2,b'r7/3r1kpp/p4p2/3q4/8/4R3/PPQ2PPP/R5K1 b - -',I have two options and this one is the better of the two in my opinion.  I need to protect the d1 square since my king is subject to a back-rank mate if I do not.  Moving to the c2 square is preferred since it allows my rook on the a1 square to move more freely.
141,4,36,2Rad8,b'3r4/3r1kpp/p4p2/3q4/8/4R3/PPQ2PPP/R5K1 w - -',I thought black might try Rc8 which would force me to move Qe2 however he went for the triple battery.

144,4,39,Qxb2,b'3r4/3r1kpQ/p4p2/8/8/4R2P/Pq3PP1/R5K1 w - -',The computer rates this as a blunder.  I have no real option but to move my a rook to e1 and that creates a powerful combination to assault black's king.
145,4,40,Qxa2,b'3r4/3r1kpQ/p4p2/8/8/4R2P/q4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Now I am at a crossroads.  Black's king is exposed and surrounded by powerful pieces.  My mating radar was going off big time and I knew there was a winning combination there.

I thought long and hard about it and thought I had every possible response mapped but I didn't count on one.  Luckily Black did not see the ideal response either as it would have negated my move.  I was actually really pumped about this sequence until I saw the computer analysis.  

Discounting Qd5 black is going down almost no matter what he plays here.  The question becomes what pieces does he want left at the end.

The ideal sequence is

148,4,43,g6,b'4r3/3r1k2/p4pp1/7Q/8/7P/q4PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Any other move is mate.

35.	Qxg6	

or do I want to lose both of my rooks with

Here is the second instance where I thought I had a decent mating attack going against my opponent.  I intended to go right for the jugular here which is fairly rare for jstevens1!  However in doing so I overlooked a tactical shot.  I thought I could get out of it but then a knight move from my opponent gave me grim confirmation that I would remain a piece light.  Again after that I waved the white flag.  So how did this happen?  Well read on.  Gameknot analysis link to follow:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17067335&fb=1&rnd=0.3711907782109783"

First chess is not an entertaining game.  Instead it is much more serious then that so it is a good idea to study the board and take time to analyze the positions before you make a move.  It will also help to alleviate boredom if you annotate games use analyze the board flip and/or game notes in the process.  There are also some occasions where one must tolerate boredom to play well and Jack Stockel agrees with this assessment.  After these rushed games I take chess as serious as my hardest college courses (Precalculus and Inorganic Chemistry 1).  Second when you move too quickly your mind cannot absorb the information so you do not learn from your mistakes.  After all when you rush you are not being careful.  When you are not careful you get into trouble.

610,25,78,4Rg3,b'8/8/4p3/1p1p4/3k4/6RP/1r1p2P1/3K4 b - -',A smart move. He prevents my king from completely trapping the king then I would just need to push my rook up to b1 and unstoppable move (checkmate).
611,25,79,4e5,b'8/8/8/1p1pp3/3k4/6RP/1r1p2P1/3K4 w - -',I push my pawn up hoping to block his rook from preventing my king from going through the third rank.

625,26,3,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black pawn blocks my pawn in the c rail by moving up to c5. It's a free pawn for my taking if I want from d4.
626,26,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I pass the pawn and move up to d5.
627,26,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black blocks with a pawn to d6.
628,26,6,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2P5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I put forward my pawn from base line to e3. This opens up my Queen and my bishop in f1.
629,26,7,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black moves pawn up to g6.

633,27,0,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A rare continuation. The idea is to reach a position similar to the Kan where Black has not wasted a tempo with ...a6.  White has to be accurate to obtain an advantage.
634,27,1,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I was a little bemused at this point.  Black seems to have lost a tempo but White's Knight is not ideally placed.  5.Nb5 just didn't seem to work.
635,27,2,Be3,b'rnbqk1nr/1p2bppp/p2pp3/8/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Simply O-O and White has a good game.  At this point I am thinking castling long which I now think is a mistake.
636,27,3,b5,b'rnbqk1nr/4bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq b6',Black starts a minority attack.
637,27,4,Qe2,b'rnbqk1nr/4bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Not to late to play O-O but I stubbornly continue to play for O-O-O even though it means castling right into Black's attack. 
638,27,5,1f3,b'rn1qk1nr/1b2bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBBP2/PPP1Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White still could play O-O.  The most popular idea in the datebase was for White to play a combination of f4 and O-O-O.  I had actually noticed that Black did well in those games and that White did better when he castled short.  Playing f3 with the idea of playing a type of English Attack at least got me out of the database.
639,27,6,1a3,b'r2qk1nr/1b2bppp/p1npp3/1p6/4P3/PNNBBP2/1PP1Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',?! Somehow I thought this slowed down Black's queenside play and perhaps it does temporarily; but it makes it all the more stronger when it finally comes.
640,27,7,Qc7,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/PNNBBP2/1PP1Q1PP/2KR3R w kq -',Black definitely has an edge now.
641,27,8,1g4,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P1P1/PNNBBP2/1PP1Q2P/2KR3R b kq g3',At least I am consistent.

644,27,11,1Nb6,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/pn1pp3/6P1/1n2P2P/1NNBBP2/1PP1Q3/2KR3R w kq -',?! Better for Black would be 16.... Ne5

646,27,13,1a5,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/1n1pp3/p5P1/1n2P2P/1NNBBP2/1PP1Q2R/2KR4 w kq -',?! I think Black would do better striking in the center with 17...d5.
647,27,14,1Bb5+,b'r3k2r/1bq1bppp/1n1pp3/pB4P1/1n2P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP1Q2R/2KR4 b kq -',There was a time that I would have believed that for White to seek counterplay on the Queenside was strategically wrong.  This move takes advantage of the fact that Black has not castled yet and can't get his rooks into play as fast as White can.  I decided to seek active play on the queenside.  If I can trade some pieces to where I no longer need to fear a king hunt then I have an extra piece (the king) on the queenside and can fight effectively on that wing.
648,27,15,1Bc6,b'r3k2r/2q1bppp/1nbpp3/pB4P1/1n2P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP1Q2R/2KR4 w kq -',18...Kf8 comes into consideration.
649,27,16,2Qb5,b'r3k2r/4bppp/1nqpp3/pQ4P1/1n2P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP4R/2KR4 b kq -',?? Consistent but there is a big tactical flaw.  White could have equalized here with 20.Nd4!
650,27,17,2Nc4,b'r3k2r/4bppp/2qpp3/pQ4P1/1nn1P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP4R/2KR4 w kq -',??  My opponent returns the favor with a counter-blunder.  20...Na2+ would have been devastating.  21. Kd2 Nc4+ 22.Ke1 Qxb5 23.Nxb5 Nxe3-+
651,27,18,2Qxc6+,b'r3k2r/4bppp/2Qpp3/p5P1/1nn1P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP4R/2KR4 b kq -',and now the game is equal.

653,27,20,3Na4,b'6k1/4bppp/1r1pp3/p3n1P1/N2NP2P/1P3P2/2PR4/2K5 b - -',And here in an absolute equal position my opponent timed out.  I think he had computer problems as he timed out in several games.
654,28,0,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Stronger seems Nh5. If I don't want to take the bishop back I go Bg3 accepting the exchange to use the h file.

Last year I opted for 3...Nc6 and after 4.Nf3 we had a quiet two knights. In that game he had no advantage after the opening however he managed to outplay me in the middlegame and got an endgame with two extra pawns which he easily converted (I'm planning to annotate that game as well).

Usually 9...Bf5 is played. Black then doesn't have to be afraid of losing the bishop pair (which was the main reason for my 9...Be7 because after 10.Nxd6 Qxd6 he has strong centre control and easy development in return. I considered 9...Bc7 as well but I didn't like the look of 10.Nc5 so I decided to keep his knight out of c5 for now.
684,29,8,1Qf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p5/4pb2/4N3/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Not bad but 11.Qh5 (as played in one game that I found on another website) was probably stronger. It seems as if I'm forced to give up the bishop pair anyway with 11...Bxe4 12.dxe4 because if I move my bishop the e5 pawn is hanging. After 11...Qd7 12.Ng3 seems very strong (the bishop has to move anyway and then the pawn can be taken) and 11...g6 creates huge weaknesses in the king's position.

I was pondering this move and 17...Ne6 but I didn't like the fact that after 17...Ne6 he could exchange with 18.Bxe6 fxe6 creating doubled isolated pawns on an open file. The computer prefers 17...Ne6 slightly but doesn't suggest the exchange after that (apparently the bishop is too strong to be exchanged for that knight). But I also had a knight manoeuvre in mind which we'll see in a moment.

However this also creates some weaknesses of his own. Maybe 19.Bc5 should be considered (as I expected and was also suggested by the computer).

Then I started calculating and found the game continuation including the winning move at move 24. So... Had the master really made a blunder? I checked and double-checked but couldn't find a refutation. When he got back I confidently took the knight. But if this sacrifice is incorrect what is the right move here then? 22.Ne3 is strongly met with 22...Nxe3 23.Qxe3 e4! (I didn't spot that during the game) creating a lot of problems for White. 22.g4? obviously leaves the h4 pawn hanging so the only viable option is 22.Bxd5 Qxd5 23.Qxd5 cxd5 and then 24.Ne3 but it's clear something has gone wrong for White already.

However the trouble with gambits is that they are generally wrong and will lead to death. The keys to refuting a gambit lay in accepting it once but not twice. This means if your opponent offers a freebie once take it but refuse it the second freebie. Otherwise you can be caught being to greedly. The other key of refuting a gamibt is to play principled chess that follows the rules. I.E develop your pieces control the centre and ensure your king's safety. Finally if your opponent offers you a freebie take it and dare them to prove that going behind in material for nothing is worth it.

These positions are very difficult to play because white has to play assertively due to the material imbalance and extremely overextended center. Therefore white can easily run into the risk of overplaying and collapsing like a deck of cards. I would caution against facilitating your enemies plans while ingoring your weaknesses. There are several ways that you can prevent your opponent from doing what they want but one of the best ways is distractions.

Bxb7 opens up another line to the king via the b file. the rule is to keep all roads to your king closed. But the question is how does white do that? The answer is 13. Ne4 which deals with the threat of Bxn and covers the g5 square from back door checks. It is difficult to resist the attack at all costs plan since it is often flashy and fun.
