314,14,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Nothing special with this response - quite standard too
315,14,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',White wants to challenge the control of the e5 center square. Also developing the black squared bishop by this move.
316,14,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This move from black is odd and the variation is called Albin counter gambit. If white takes at e5 it will become a doublepawn that might be able to win back later on. If white takes at e5 its bad by black to take at c4 since after Queen exchanges black cant Castle anymore.
317,14,4,dxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White takes at e5. Probably best move.
318,14,5,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black moves to d4 with his pawn. This is a possible move but maybe not the best. Anyway we have played these moves only for getting to a position where a student can learn alot. Lets see what happens....
319,14,6,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Another move that can be questioned but just wait and see what happens next.
320,14,7,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black checks white and white can make 2 ok moves. Please ask the student if he or she can find those 2 moves..
321,14,8,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Another option would have been placing the knight there. Moving the king was bad and placing the Queen in front of the king is also a bad sacrifice.
322,14,9,dxe3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bP5/4p3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',"White can take back the pawn at e3 with the f-pawn. But can it be a better move to take the unprotected black bishop at b4? Think about it..yes or no? Another option could be Qa4 check!

323,14,10,Bxb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/4p3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Yes! But now black has some counterplay. Ask the student if he/she can find the right move...give it some time..
324,14,11,exf2+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP3pPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Oh yes! This check is fierce. Flip the board and let the student tell what white should do...
325,14,12,Ke2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP2KpPP/RN1Q1BNR b kq -',Right. Because if whites king takes at f2 then white will lose his Queen since it will become unprotected. Now flip the board and let the student think about what black should do next....
326,14,13,fxg1=N+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP2K1PP/RN1Q1BnR w kq -',Why promote to knight and not a Queen?! Think about what happens if promoting to anything else but a knight. White will simply exchange queens and take the piece at g1. But when promoting to a knight its check! And white can therefore not make the queenexchange. White must do something about the check first. Ask the student what white should do about the check? Is Rxg1 a good move for example or what?...
327,14,14,Ke1,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP4PP/RN1QKBnR b kq -',No! If Rxg1 then the c8 bishop will move to g4 and white will lose the Queen. Therefore white must return to e1 square. Ask the student what black should move now?
328,14,15,Qh4+,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP4q/8/PP4PP/RN1QKBnR w kq -',Yes! A good move. Please flip the board again and ask what white should do about the check? What will happen if white makes the move g3 for example?
329,14,16,Kd2,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP4q/8/PP1K2PP/RN1Q1BnR b kq -',If g3 - then Qe4 with a check and the rook at h1 can be taken next move. And white must defend the Qe4 check also and ask the student which move they would make. Be2 or Kf2 or Kd2 or even Qe2? But Queen e2 is dumb since the knight can take it then. Ok so g3 was bad and therefore white made the move Kd2 as we could see here. Now as a last question you can ask 2 questions in this lesson to the student. First of all - how many checks can black do? Its ok to show also idiotmoves. Tell them to show all squares where you can check. Last of all. Ask which move your student would make here. 
330,14,17,Qd8+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP1K2PP/RN1Q1BnR w kq -',These are the squares Qd8 Qh6 Qg5 Qf4 Qf2 Qe1 Qd4 Nf3. Maybe none of the checks are best move. Bg4 would develop a piece and might be worth to mention. End of lesson.

348,16,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So it starts with the most typical opening.
349,16,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I do not know why chicoboy only advanced the pawn one square.  If I were black I would have played 1...c5 because my favorite is still the Sicilian.  Just as good are 1...e5 (the King's Pawn Game) or 1...d5 (which becomes the Scandinavian Defense.) 
350,16,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This however is still a standard move and lesplay does not have to meet any changes yet.  I also would have played this if I were white.  In this position white is already starting to develop.  
351,16,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is a developing move because it develops a central pawn.  But the e pawn is usually developed on the first move unless you get into a QG or Benonni variation.  However it is not too little or too late.
352,16,4,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',?! I understand that white was also developing and wanted to get his DSB out.  But this is the first inaccuracy.  Better was 3.d4 which virtually forces an exchange with 3...exd4 4.Qxd4.  This move however is going to restrict his LSB so that it is restricted to the second rank.  Or he has to make several moves to get his f2 bishop out when it should only take one.  This is why it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.
353,16,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I like black's thought process here.  Chicoboy is continuing to develop in an attempt to get all of his pieces out and this is a good way to do that.
354,16,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is standard.
355,16,7,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Another standard move which I understand quite well.  Not only does black develop but this move pins white's queen.  I am also the kind of person that likes to pin N's to Q's or N's to K's.
356,16,8,Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Ok I know where lesplay is going.  Not only does white decide to break the pin but this will get him ready to castle on his next move.
357,16,9,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move is ok and it develops.  But if I were black I would have played 5...Be7 so that I could castle on my next move.  As we will see later on however chicoboy is not going to castle Kingside but rather Queenside.  This should make for an interesting game because both players will castle on the opposite wings.
358,16,10,Qd7,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I do not know why black brought his Q out this early.  Better was to continue developing with 6...Be7 or 6...0-0.
359,16,11,Qd2,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',So the same thing could be said for white but in a different sense.  Better was to bring the DSB out for development.  This move however blocks his B so black is now ahead in development.
360,16,12,d5,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Ok this is standard.  I know that black is hoping for an exchange and this kind is very common.  And black is going to be successful in exchanging material.
361,16,13,Ne4,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2n5/3np3/4N1b1/3P1N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',So lesplay decides to avoid another exchange.  But if I were white that exchange would have occurred.  Note: I like exchanges when I'm ahead or material is level. 
362,16,14,f5,b'r3kb1r/pppq2pp/2n5/3npp2/4N1b1/3P1N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq f6',! I like this move a lot for two reasons.  First black is developing another central pawn.  Second it attacks whites N.
363,16,15,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/pppq2pp/2n5/3npp2/6b1/2NP1N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',! This is what I mean when I talk about castling on opposite wings.  Normally I prefer to castle Kingside but in this position chicoboy made the right choice.  Had black castled short there would be a whole around his K making it vulnerable.
364,16,16,1a3,b'2kr1b1r/pppq2pp/2n5/3npp2/6b1/P1NP1N2/1PPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I do not know why white played this.  However this move is not going to stop black from exchanging material.
365,16,17,Re8,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/2n5/4pp2/6b1/P1QP1N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',"In addition I do not know why chicoboy moved here.  Better was to get the DSB out as it completes development.  Note: One of the main goals in an opening is to ""develop develop develop"" as schakertjie puts it.  Sometimes the player has very good reason for not developing but this is not one of them."
366,16,18,1Qd2,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/2n5/4pp2/6b1/P2P1N2/1PPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',I do not know why lesplay made this retreat.  First the Q was not attacked.  Second it would have been better for him to bring out the DSB for development.  With that in mind I think that black now has another small advantage.
367,16,19,1Nd4,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/8/4pp2/3n2b1/P2P1N2/1PPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',In this position black wants to exchange and he is going to be successful.
368,16,20,1f3,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/8/5p2/3p2b1/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',! At first I wasn't sure why lesplay played.  I thought that better was to exchange with 15.Bxe2 Qxe2.  A second look at the position proves that I am wrong and this is actually the best move in this position.  That's because chicoboy would get a free piece because of the e8 R which I forgot about.  If black retook with 15...Qxe2?? 16.Rxe2.  So this move was absolutely necessary to protect his LSB.  So with that in mind black now has a bigger advantage given that there's a whole around white's K.  As a result lesplay must be very careful to stay in the game.
369,16,21,1Bh5,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/8/5p1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Black's only retreat for now but that is not a big deal especially because it won't stop him from developing.  I have had forced retreats like this in several games against Jack Stockel.
370,16,22,1Rb1,b'2k1rb1r/pppq2pp/8/5p1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/1RB2RK1 b - -',I do not know why lesplay moved here.  Better was 16.Qg5.  This way the Q cannot get attacked and he can find a perfect outpost to develop his DSB.
371,16,23,1Qd5,b'2k1rb1r/ppp3pp/8/3q1p1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/1RB2RK1 w - -',At first I had no clue as to why black moved his Q but it makes perfect sense now.  In this position he wants to win white's R.
372,16,24,1Ra1,b'2k1rb1r/ppp3pp/8/3q1p1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',While this move protects it better was to advance one of his pawns from the a-c rank.  So something like 17.b3.  But with this move lesplay just keeps moving his a R back and forth so he is wasting tempii.
373,16,25,1Qe5,b'2k1rb1r/ppp3pp/8/4qp1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',! I understand chicoboys intentions.  In my mind it is an extremely good move and near extraordinarly brilliant.  Black is playing extremely well and has not made any mistakes yet.  However this is his best move of the entire game so far.  Not only is he attacking white's piece but lesplay is now going to have an extremely difficult time completing development after he protects his B.
374,16,26,Bd6,b'2k1r2r/ppp3pp/3b4/4qp1b/3p4/P2P1P2/1PPQB1PP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',! And now black's development is complete!  In addition he is threatening mate in one which is going to delay white's development even more because it is actually quite difficult to get out of this situation.  In other words it's a complicated threat as opposed to unsound.  
375,16,27,1g3,b'2k1r2r/ppp3pp/3b4/4qp1b/3p4/P2P1PP1/1PPQB2P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',White's only move.  And with that in mind black is now winning.
376,16,28,1h6,b'2k1r2r/ppp3p1/3b3p/4qp1b/3p4/P2P1PP1/1PPQB2P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',I do not know why chicoboy played this.  Although there is nothing wrong with this move in my opinion 19...g4 was slightly as it plans out another difficult attack against white.  Note: it's now safe to attack since black is completely.  The only question is how easy would it have been for lesplay to pick up on black's intention?
377,16,29,2b3,b'2k1r2r/ppp3p1/3b3p/4qp1b/3p4/PP1P1PP1/2PQB2P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',! Ok this is one of white's better move.  So far he is not playing poorly but is still behind on development.  However that is going to change with this move.  Why?  Everything will be developed after he fianchettos his DSB.  And that is his intention.
378,16,30,2Rhf8,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b3p/4qp1b/3p4/PP1P1PP1/2PQB2P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',! I really like this move.  While it may not make sense to everyone chicoboy decided to do more then just connect his Rooks.  He doubled them up and that will usually give black another big advantage.  So most of the time it is considered to be a very good move.  Why?  Because doubled rooks not only gives you protection in the long run but can pose as a dangerous threat against the opposing player.  Jack Stockel told me that you should double up your rooks if possible.
379,16,31,2Bb2,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b3p/4qp1b/3p4/PP1P1PP1/1BPQB2P/R3R1K1 b - -',Like I said earlier white's development is now complete.
380,16,32,2f4,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b3p/4q2b/3p1p2/PP1P1PP1/1BPQB2P/R3R1K1 w - -',?! At this point black wanted to exchange and hopefully get a mating threat.  But what would happen if white decided to make the exchange?  Then if black retook he would start losing material and this is where calculation becomes important.  So this is chicoboy's first inaccuracy.  Note: This is why at one point I only looked at things move by move.  If I tried too much at once I would start going wrong by miscalculating and this is a perfect example.  What could have happened was 21.gxf3 Qxf3.  But then 22.Qxf3 Bxf3 or 22...Rxf3 and everything is even.  Right now I'd say that black is winning but if that exchange had occurred chicoboy might have turned a winning position into a drawn position.  Luckily however lesplay decides to decline the exchange by attacking black's LSB.
381,16,33,2c4,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2bp/4q3/2Pp1pP1/PP1P1P2/1B1QB2P/R3R1K1 b - c3',? I do not know why lesplay moved here but it is a big mistake.  White did not count on the fact that black can make an en-pessant capture 23...dxc3 e.p.  After that white would be in a lot of trouble.
382,16,34,2h5,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2b1/4q2p/2Pp1pP1/PP1P1P2/1B1QB2P/R3R1K1 w - -',However white is lucky because black misses the opportunity.  Instead chicoboy decides to play this in an attempt to exchange. 
383,16,35,2Bf1,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2b1/4q2p/2Pp1pP1/PP1P1P2/1B1Q3P/R3RBK1 b - -',?! At first I did not know why lesplay played this but the problem with this move is that it undevelops.  And the reason for doing so is not very good.  As it turns out white is attempting to win black's Q in this position.  Here's a thing however black's Q is not pinned.  So this is an example of unsound aggression because the threat is straight forward and very easy to defend against as we are about to see.  
384,16,36,2Red1,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2b1/6qp/2Pp1pP1/PP1P1P2/1B1Q3P/R2R1BK1 b - -',?? I understand this move very well.  In this position lesplay decides to bring his R right under the Q to put pressure on the d file.  But it's too little too late.  In addition this is the losing blunder because it gives away a free pawn and there will be no compensation for the loss.  There is however more to this then meets the eye.  This move exposes white's K so black will be able to set up a mating threat.  Now the threat involves a mating net and it will be virtually impossible for white to defend against it.  At this point I would consider resigning if I were white.  Right now resignation is premature but that is about to change.  
385,16,37,gxf3+,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2b1/6q1/2PB1p2/PP1P1p2/3Q3P/R2R1BK1 w - -',And the threat starts here.
386,16,38,2Kh1,b'2k1rr2/ppp3p1/3b2b1/6q1/2PB1p2/PP1P1p2/3Q3P/R2R1B1K b - -',This is best.  Also feasible was 27.Bg2 but then 27...Bxg2 which gives away a free piece at the very least.  However like I said earlier the game is lost for white.
387,16,39,2Rfh8,b'2k1r2r/ppp3p1/3b2b1/6q1/2PB1p2/PP1P1p2/3Q3P/R2R1B1K w - -',!! After white get's out of check black makes another threat.  And it is part of chicoboy's plan to mate white so this move is brilliant because it will eventually make it impossible for white to defend against the threat.  That's because black is coordinating and mobilizing all of his pieces to set lesplay up for disaster.
388,16,40,2Qf2,b'2k1r2r/ppp3p1/3b2b1/6q1/2PB1p2/PP1P1p2/5Q1P/R2R1B1K b - -',At this point white wants to compensate for his lost pawn but his plan is not going to work as I mentioned earlier.  That's because black is going to force another exchange as we will see shortly.  Note: an exchange will really benefit chicoboy this time since he is ahead.
389,16,41,2Be5,b'2k1r2r/ppp3p1/6b1/4b1q1/2PB1p2/PP1P1p2/5Q1P/R2R1B1K w - -',And this is how black does it.
390,16,42,3Rde1,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/6b1/4r1q1/2P2p2/PP1P1p2/5Q1P/R3RB1K b - -',? But white now wants to exchange.  However that is a bad idea for two reasons.  First lesplay is behind.  Most importantly chicoboy has mating threats so exchanging material is less important then focusing on the threats.  In fact this is going to make things easier for black because white will have less material to defend against the threat.
391,16,43,Qg3,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/6b1/8/2P2p2/PP1P1pq1/5Q1P/4RB1K w - -',And chicoboy is determined not to give white any chances of counterplay.  This will force an exchange and lesplay cannot with his h2 pawn because of black's remaining rook.  Not only that but black reconnects his pawns after 32...fxg3.  That's important because Mr. Stockel told me that allowing your opponent to undouble his or her pawns will get you into a lot of trouble.
392,16,44,3Bg2,b'2k4r/ppp3p1/6b1/8/2P5/PP1P1pp1/6BP/4R2K b - -',?? I understand that lesplay wanted to defend against the mating net but I don't know why he played this as opposed to 33.Kg1.  This move loses immediately.  The game was already lost for white but this ends the game instantly as we are about to find out.
393,16,45,3Rxh2+,b'2k5/ppp3p1/6b1/8/2P5/PP1P1pp1/6Br/4R2K w - -',This is one of the consequences of white's last move.  First white lost another pawn.  Second 33.Bg2?? also gives away a piece in addition to the pawn.  That's because after 34.Kg2 (forced) Rg2+.  Finally although it is not immediate mate is inevitable and around the corner because black is going to deliver mate with his R LSB f and g pawns.  Lesplay saw all of this and resigned.  Overall both players did extremely well for themselves.  But white went wrong by giving away a free pawn and that was his first blunder.   It proves that only one blunder can make or break a game.

509,19,28,3Kc6,b'8/Rp4pp/2k2p2/2r5/8/P1P4P/1P3PP1/1K6 w - -',Black plays this with the intention of leaving the rook where it is and try to penetrate white's field since the king can't defend both sides.

That lost you far more tempo than Ra8 I would think. Yes Ra8 didn't help you much either but now you spend time pondering where a king should go as a rook denies it a rank. The king is slower (let alone game pivoting) so it should have sought shelter in the general b3 area I think. Instead you've left it more exposed to the rook as it finds better places to attack while checking you after c4 was played."". The issue was the black's rook penetration.

523,19,42,5c6+,b'8/1k4pp/2PK1p2/PP3r2/8/8/8/8 b - -',?? The wrong advance. I have to play a6 because c5 guarded by the king is my defence against the rook.

Aron Niemzowitsch in the 1920's Salo Flohr in the 1930's World Champions Tigran Petrosyan and Vassili Smyslov in the 1950's and 1960's and in the 1980's Kasparov's predecessor as champion Anatoli Karpov have all made use of it. The idea is to develop the KN at KB3 and be able to reply to NxN with... NxN thus preserving the Black pawn structure.

(After-match analysis by Mr. Pandolfini) Why *did* Kasparov lose? Surely he was enervated. Most authorities believe that Garri simply wore himself out. He got advantageous positions but exhausted himself in the process working out the intricacies of unfamiliar lines. After five of these intense struggles over a mere eight days Kasparov had nothing left for the fateful sixth game. -- BP [My own hypothesis is that Kasparov's spirit was broken by game 5. He had what seemed a sure win stolen away when Deep Blue came up with an astonishing perpetual check after Kasparov queened a pawn in the endgame. Kasparov then had zero days rest in between Games 5 and 6 and was still in psychological shock. If he'd had a day off to regain his mental equilibrium we might well have seen a much sharper Garri Kasparov in the decisive 6th game. -- LA]

I didn't compute this far in the Blitz game. Just now I did this in my head since I didn't have a board handy so...take the proposed line thoughtfully and look for better moves.

Those of you who ever have a chance to play me at blitz chess will notice that my quality of play plummets precipitously; this is one small example.

832,34,11,1O-O-O+,b'r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/8/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',An easily parried threat but in faster games it's a LOT easier to be on the offensive than on the defensive. Black's options don't look great at this point: Nd7 blocks in the other bishop too Bd7 loses a piece (and maybe more) to c5 and King moves have their own problems (e.g. 10. ...Kf8 11. c5 Nd7 12. Bf5 with Ne5 looming).
833,34,12,1Kc7,b'r1b2b1r/ppk1pppp/1n2n3/8/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',?! Also not good. There isn't a lot of safety to be found on the queenside. White has some pretty strong continuations.

835,34,14,1Kb8,b'rkb2b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/1N6/2P5/4BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',White would love to play Bf4+ as a follow-up but currently the Ne6 guards the f4 square.

844,35,5,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Of all the choices of destination for the Bishop this seemed to be the most circumspect.  Any Black incursion at g4 is ruled out and the Bishop presents much less of a target than he would at c4 and b5.  Although in some systems the Bishop would have still well at d3 it seems that it doesn't in this again because it presents more of a target than doing anything useful.
845,35,6,Re8,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Striking towards White's semi-backward e-pawn.  This move is multi-purpose the rook being very handy on the e-file: discouraging e4-e5; hitting the e-pawn and with veiled threats down the whole length of the file.
846,35,7,1O-O,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',OK there will be no pins down the e-file!

It further restrains White's projected advance of the e-pawn and even contemplates a blockade by ...Ne5 (though this doesn't often happen).  Further there is the possibility of slotting in at c5 if the pawn presently there were to advance.
848,35,9,1a4,b'r1bqr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N5/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - a3',That Black has not yet played forward her flank pawns does not stop White from getting in this restraining move.

But also possible was 11...Ne5!? with the idea 12.f4? Neg4! threatening a Q/R fork at e3.  After the text move  I could have played 12.a5 but chose instead to build up the centre. 
850,35,11,1f4,b'r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - f3',This advance goes towards the central plan of breaking through in the centre if possible.  But it also keeps the Black Knight out of e5.

All sorts of moves come to mind to play here but I chose this non-committal - almost a 'waiting' move - for reasons that I can no longer recall to memory!  Very likely it had something to do with the possibility of a bishop check at d4 (or a queen at b6) but why it should have worried me at this point is hard to fathom.  I hadn't yet foreseen the way this game would go... I suspect I had seen something similar in a recent game and thought it would be appropriate here.
853,35,14,1b6,b'1rbqr1k1/3n1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',[?!] Surprisingly restrained.  I was expecting the thematic 13...b4.

E.g. 15.Nc4 Bg4  16.Bxg4? Nxg4.  It is probable that  it was in view of a line such as this that I played the pragmatic Kh1 move.

Quite playable is 18.Na5 heading for Nc6 an idea that has certain attractions.  But I had already seen an altogether different idea that would lead to a tactical brawl.

But I was unable to find any other continuation that furthered White's progress.  The attack upon the Queen at least gave White a tempo.  Black now has three moves available for the queen.  Only one of them allows her to protect the c-pawn...
869,35,30,2Qb6,b'1rb1rnk1/3n1pbp/1q1P2p1/1Bp1P3/5P2/2N1B2P/1PQ3P1/R4R1K w - -',[?] This the only move that maintained the queen's guard over the c-pawn turns out to be the critical mistake that tips the balance in White's favour.  Jo has terrible luck against me and this is an example of it.  As it transpired it took me a while to appreciate what had happened.  Instead according to the GK engine 22.Qd8 would have kept Black in the game: 22...Qd8  23.Qf2 Ne6!?  -[The GK engine gives 23...Bb7  24.Bxc5 f6!  25.Bd4 fxe5  26.fxe5 Bxe5  27.Qf7ch Kh8   28.Bxe5ch Rxe5  29.Bc4 -[threatens mate]- 29...Ne6  30.Bxe6 Rxe6  but after 31.Qxe6 White looks to be winning.
