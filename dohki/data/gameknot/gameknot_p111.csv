15,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian Defense is a heavy theory opening. 1-Most players especially those who are in the club level should NOT study openings heavily. The more important rule that it is almost always better to acquire understanding of chess than to get the theoretical knowledge. With theory you are getting one position memorized. With understanding you get a better thought process that will get you hundreds of better moves in your chess play. So *Thought process is more important than theoretical knowledge by a huge amount at least for the club players trying to improve.
16,1,2,f3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It's a less theoretical variation of the maroczy bind. Using the first tip you can know that when studying openings most players do not need a very deep opening knowledge. Instead they should get a general understanding of the plan for both sides. Of course it depends on the opening and heres the next tip. 2-Improving club players should NOT use highly complicated openings that require heavy theoretical knowledge. If an opening requires you to study book for many hours it is the wrong choice. You should be able to find right moves after a general understanding. 
17,1,3,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',"3-A very common misconception is the ""steady chess improvement"". One of the most important things I learned from an experienced chess master from a tournament was that chess improvement happens suddenly and not steadily. Fischer once said ""One day I just got good"". Basically if you study chess correctly by improving thinking you won't get immediate improvement but you will get a sudden bursts after long periods of time. So don't expect to improve by a few points each week or something. You will get a sudden noticable improvement."

It simply means that if you have gotton better you MUST notice the improvement by concrete results in your playing. If you have not gotton better quality of play or consistently get better results then your study of chess is wrong and you should change it. Many club players at plateaus read hundreds of chess books but don't improve. They need to change the study and then improve. Instead they just keep finding more books to read and are disappointed when they don't get better. A good chess book many people have praised is the book ""Silman's reassess your chess"". Personally I love this book and it has improved my results greatly. Yet there are players 1200uscf reading this book. Of course they have no improvement from it since it is way too advanced but there are a lot of things they learn. But if the book does not help you get better results then it is not right for you at the time."

As a final note I should say that the most important thiing to avoid if you want to improve is the useless information and chess thoery that does not improve your results. For example a lot of people study theoretical endgames. I have looked at only 7 theoretical endgame positions(Theses are special since they are of utmost importance and can actually occur in practive) and only 3 have happened in my games. Many of my games go to the endgame as well. So many theoretical positions never happen. 
If you use these tips I have a guarantee that it will help you improve."

Blacks Knight is pinned and black is cramped for space. White thinks the h6 move is to unpin the Knight. Maybe h6 is a good move maybe not so good a move. A chess player better than white might have an opinion one way or the other. White now have a choice to make.

Whites thought process here is between two choices. Take the Knight or retreat.

If white takes the Knight tempo is lost whites ""projected power"" decreases and creates a crack in whites King side.

If white retreats tempo is still lost but the Knight is stilled pinned. After looking what the board would look like after retreating to h4 white moves there. White can not see a move black could make next to stop white from castling next time around.

Bottom line is white retreats and retreats to a square that keeps the Knight pinned."

It took about 30 seconds to analyze move and hit the submit button.

It will soon be Blacks King Knight and Pawn against whites two Bishops and Queen.

White clicks on the analyze button once again this time spends 30 minutes going through the different combinations thinking surely there is a forced checkmate somewhere in here. There is. Unfortunately white did not see it and let black off the hook.

!Wrong! Black Pawn to f5 would end the forced checkmate and prolong the game. This was seen after the submit button was hit for the Qh5 move.

If white was any good at chess people would pay money to watch. Instead white has to pay money to play chess.  ¿What is wrong with this picture?"

Often it is a good idea to smack the bishop about after it sets up a pin like like forcing Black to decide (if she hasn't already) to take or not on f3.  But here it will lose a pawn.  The right move was 5.d5 keeping the game more or less level.

For all her struggles she is being outplayed; White's extra rook and the cramp on Black's position are too great to overcome.  She might well have resigned here - it's a convenient moment - but chose instead to carry on to the bitter end.  Now some find this sort of thing rather objectionable but they ought not to do so.  Even if the opponent is being merely bloody-minded about the whole thing you don't know this.  There are all sorts of motivations that might keep one playing on in a hopeless situation.  For one thing Black might have considered the situation given the rating difference not without hope at that.  In any case not all hopeless positions are hopeless (check out some of my other annotated games e.g. 'Die Hard').  Or it might have been an act of discipline or  a learning exercise (teaching herself to look for the defensive or counter -attacking possibilities in  difficult circumstances).  Having played on Black did her opponent this courtesy: she allowed him to deliver the final checkmate.
144,6,28,2Bf7,b'3Rnr1k/p1p2B1p/1p6/5pp1/4p3/2P4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',(!)  Now the GKE regards this as a mistake and it is true that 25.Bb5! won a piece for nothing.  But there are reasons for my regarding this rather clever move as pretty nearly as good.  Once the minor pieces go Black will be able to keep her rook only at the cost of a pawn or two.  In an ending like this the win of a pawn would for White be just about as valuable as the win of a piece.

155,6,39,3Ree7,b'8/p1pRRrk1/1p5p/6p1/4p1P1/2P5/PP3P2/6K1 b - -',(!) A neat finesse.  The rooks still come off but White ensures his remaining one gets onto the 7th rank at once.
156,6,40,3Rxc7,b'8/p1R5/1p3k1p/6p1/4p1P1/2P5/PP3P2/6K1 b - -',Although there was nothing against taking the e-pawn I would also have chosen as White has to set up the Q-side pawn majority for White.
157,6,41,3Kg2,b'8/p1R5/1p5p/4k1p1/4p1P1/2P5/PP3PK1/8 b - -',OK: White does well to be cautious.  But I would probably have chosen 38.Rxa7 Kf4  39.Ra6 Kxg4  40.Rxb6; or 39...b5  40.Rxh6.  With nothing to oppose them White's could have shove home one of the Q-side pawns to promote; otherwise with the h-pawn gone Black would have lost the last vestige of attack.
158,6,42,3Kf4,b'8/p1R5/1p5p/6p1/4pkP1/2P5/PP3PK1/8 w - -',Stil trying gamely to conjure up counterplay ...
159,6,43,4Re8,b'4R3/p7/1p5p/5kp1/8/2P5/PP3PK1/8 b - -',I think I would have played 41.f3 and then 42.c4.  But this move is fine.
160,6,44,4Rf8+,b'5R2/p7/1p6/5kpp/8/2P5/PP3PK1/8 b - -',Unnecessary.  The Black King was cut off from the Q-side and so the White pawns could have begun their charge on that flank: 42.c4!  Note that neither of the other pawn moves are as good (42.b4 b5; 42.a4 a6) though White is so far ahead they would still have won.  After 42.c4 a5  43.b3! White's pawns grind forward against Black's resistance by 44.a3... 45.b4... 46.c5 etc.
161,6,45,4Kg4,b'5R2/p7/1p6/6pp/6k1/2P5/PP3PK1/8 w - -',(?) Allows White to cut off the King again.
162,6,46,4Kh2,b'5R2/p7/1p6/6pp/6k1/2P5/PP3P1K/8 b - -',Preferable are 43.c4 or 43.f3ch...
163,6,47,4h4,b'5R2/p7/1p6/6p1/6kp/2P5/PP3P1K/8 w - -',Now White can close down the K-side altogether.
164,6,48,4Kh3,b'5R2/p7/1p6/6pk/7p/2P2P1K/PP6/8 b - -',That's it for Black's resistance: she has nothing left in her shot locker.  But I guess she wanted to see White's technique.  It has been good enough so far!
165,6,49,4Kg4,b'5R2/p7/1p4k1/6p1/6Kp/2P2P2/PP6/8 b - -',All roads lead to Rome.  I probably would have played here 46.c4 Kg7  47.Rf5 Kg6  48.Kg4 h3  49.Rxg5ch Kf6  50.Rh5 etc.
166,6,50,5Rxh3,b'8/6k1/8/6K1/p7/2P2P1R/PP6/8 b - -',This could have waited: 51.c4 or maybe 51.b4 axb3e.p. 52.axb3. 
167,6,51,5Kg6,b'6k1/8/6K1/8/p7/2P2P1R/PP6/8 b - -',Much better was 52.Kf6! with mate in 3: 52.Kf6 a3  53.b3 Kf8  54.Rh8#
168,6,52,5bxa3,b'6k1/8/6K1/8/8/P1P2P1R/P7/8 b - -',Possibly Black was hoping White would get a bit too clever e.g. 54.f4? axb2  55.Rd3 b1=Q Oops!  But White could have 'played to the gallery' by 53.Rh4!? axb3  54.Rb4 b1=Qch  55.Rxb1 Kf8  56.Re1 and mate next move.  A more forcing line was available in 53.Kf6! axb2  54.Rh1 b1=Q  55.Rxb1 Kh7  56.Rb8  Kh6  57.Rh8#.  Check out that last line.  All Black's moves are forced.  Having said that with the disappearance of her last pawn vanishes whatever hope Black might have had of salvaging the game.
169,6,53,Kg8,b'6k1/7R/6K1/8/8/P1P2P2/P7/8 w - -',(? Relatively speaking) But 54...Ke8  55.Kf6 Kd8  56.Ke6 Kc8  57.Kd6 Kb8  58.Kc6 Ka8  59.Kb6 Kb8  60.Rh8#.  How to run the fugitive King to earth.
170,6,54,5c4,b'6k1/7R/6K1/8/2P5/P4P2/P7/8 b - -',Instead 55.Rf7 ended the game at once.  I suspect that Black might deliberately have chosen ...Kg8 as a form of resignation allowing an early mate.
171,6,55,Kd8,b'3k4/7R/2P1K3/8/8/P4P2/P7/8 w - -',Else 59...Kb8  60.Kd6 Ka8  61.Rh8ch Ka7  62.Kc5 Ka6  63.Ra8#
172,6,56,6c8=Q#,b'2Q2k2/7R/3K4/8/8/P4P2/P7/8 b - -',A good win by id=chicoboy against opposition rated over 100 ELO ahead of him.  Once having gained the upper hand he was always in control and never once looked as though he would let the game slip.  His opponent did her best to set him problems to solve but lacked the resources to put serious obstacles in his path.  Beginners and early level players might find this game worth playing through just to observe the technique of 'winning the win'.

183,7,10,1Nh6#,b'r1b2rk1/p3R3/1pp4N/4B2p/2BPn3/8/PPP3PP/RN4K1 b - -',Black suffered in this game from too early development of the Queen failure to develop his minor pieces and unfamiliarity with the defense he utilized. 3...g5 is a strong defense to the King's gambit but only if Black knows how to muster that defense.

Bxh7 I feel that it is a good game for a novice to know since the pressure down the h-file maybe enough to scare a black opponent into a rash defense. Especially after 13. ...f6 after which 14.

435,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! This is just a quick game showcasing a fun counterattack in the Fraser Variation (3.Nxe5 Nc6?!) of the Latvian Gambit. Enjoy!
436,18,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?!
437,18,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The main line.
438,18,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Standard are 3...Nf6 or 3...Qf6. I've been preferring this line recently because finding a time to develop this Knight is somewhat difficult in the main lines.
439,18,4,Qh5+,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is standard; also possible is 4.d4! The text move wins an exchange for White at the cost of giving Black plenty of activity.
440,18,5,hxg6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp4/2n2np1/5p2/4P3/7Q/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Also possible is 6...fxe4 7.Nxh8 d5.
441,18,6,d3,b'r1b1kb1Q/ppppq3/2n2np1/5p2/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQq -',This is the move that prevented 7...d5? and continues to prevent Black from playing it as he faces the more serious threat of 9.Bg5 winning the Knight.
442,18,7,fxe4,b'r1b1kb1Q/ppppq3/2n2np1/8/4p3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq -',9.Bg5? exd3+ leaves Black in good shape.
443,18,8,d5,b'r1b1kb1Q/ppp1q3/2n3p1/3p4/4n3/8/PPP1BPPP/RNB1K2R w KQq d6',Finally.
444,18,9,Bf5,b'r3kb1Q/ppp1q3/2n3pB/3p1b2/4n3/8/PPP1BPPP/RN2K2R w KQq -',There's no way to defend the DSB further; Black must simply accept it if White chooses to trade. Therefore Black puts himself as far ahead in development as possible and prepares to castle if White doesn't force the exchange.
445,18,10,1Qh4,b'r3kq2/ppp5/2n3p1/3p1b2/4n2Q/8/PPP1BPPP/RN2K2R b KQq -',? White is ahead mostly in pawns--he should be looking to trade down to an advantageous endgame even though Black's development is far superior at the moment. The text gives Black an opening for significant counterplay and sets the tone for the rest of the game.
446,18,11,1Nd4,b'r3kq2/ppp5/6p1/3p1b2/3nn2Q/8/PPP1BPPP/RN2K2R w KQq -',"! This move is one of the advantages to an early ...Nc6. White must either lose material from ...Nxc2+ or face the ugly consequences of defending c2 with a terrific number of variations sprouting up right away making calculation a nightmare.

For example defending with the Bishop may lead to something like 14.Bd3 Qb4+ 15.Nc3 Qxb2 16.Qh8+ (16.Bxe4 Qxa1+ 17.Nd1 Bxe4 18.Qh8+ Kf7 19.Qxa8 Bxg2 20.Rg1 Nf3+ 21.Ke2 Nxg1+) 16...Kf7 17.Qxd4 (17.Qxa8?? Qxc3+ with mate inevitable) 17...Qxa1+ 18.Ke2 Kxc3+ and White is lost.

Or 14.Bd1 Qb4+ 15.Nc3 Nxc3 16.Qh8+ Kf7 17.Qxa8 Nxd1+ 18.Kxd1 Qxb2 19.Rc1 Bxc2+ etc.

Of course there are many more variations; I don't think I've missed anything decisive for White though; Black simply has too many options."
447,18,12,Qb4+,b'r3k3/ppp5/6p1/3p1b2/1q1nn2Q/N7/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R w KQq -',Black offers a chance for White to win yet more material but at terrific cost: 15.c3 Nxc3! 16.Qh8+ Kf7 17.Qxa8 Ncxe2+ 18.Kf1 Bd3 or else give up his material edge in the hopes of diffusing Black's attack: 16.bxc3 Qxc3+ 17.Kd1 (17.Qf1?? is mate in three) ...Qxa1+ 18.Kd2 Qxa2+ etc.
448,18,13,1Kf1,b'r3k3/ppp5/6p1/3p1b2/1q1nn2Q/N7/PPP1BPPP/R4K1R b q -',?? This is the worst of White's options. This misstep spells certain death as now White must part with his Queen to avoid mate.
449,18,14,1Kg1,b'r3k3/ppp5/6p1/3p1b2/1q1n3Q/N7/PPPnBPPP/R5KR b q -',?? White was already lost but still.
450,18,15,1Nxe2#,b'r3k3/ppp5/6p1/3p1b2/1q5Q/N7/PPPnnPPP/R5KR w q -',That's it! I hope you enjoyed the swift counterattack and the game in general. Many thanks to archenon for the game! Comments are appreciated; if you leave a rating please also tell me what I did well or what I need to improve. Thanks for reading!
451,19,0,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',The Scotch Game/Gambit you've all seen this before. For me this is my favorite opening.
452,19,1,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Ah This isn't a really good move. It brings the queen out and the queen also has no threat which means white technically takes the center right out of blacks hands. Better would be d6 or Nf6.
453,19,2,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',This move takes back some center control but not that whole lot. It also stops white from playing e5 which almost completely traps the DSB stops black from even doing the slightest to take back control of the center and also stops the knight from going to f6.
454,19,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This is just a simple move which develops my LSB allowing me to castle and also attacking the weak f-pawn.
455,19,4,fxe6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/3pp3/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Okay maybe not the best trade-off but the king is exposed now!
456,19,5,Bg5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/3ppn2/6B1/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',I'm not letting this knight go any further. Also I'm almost done with my development.
457,19,6,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/6B1/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Yeah I'm done with my development. This position is fairly equal. I think.
458,19,7,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Ok this is a fairly offensive move isn't it? If you can see I am aiming to land my Queen on e6 forcing the King into a corner or pinning the rook.
459,19,8,1dxe5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/4pn2/4p1B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The system marked this as a mistake dunno why.
460,19,9,Qd6,b'r4rk1/ppp1b1pp/3qpn2/4Q1B1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Only move to prevent Qxe6. I really don't like Queen trades for some reason.
461,19,10,Qb6,b'r4rk1/ppp1b1pp/1q2pn2/6B1/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now the Queen eyes down the undefended b-pawn while giving a small threat to f2.
462,19,11,1a4,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1pp/1q2pn2/6B1/P7/2N5/1PP1QPPP/1R3RK1 b - a3',The computer analysis said that we were at a completely equal position. I guess I'd expect that much.
463,19,12,1h6,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1p1/1q2pn1p/6B1/P7/2N5/1PP1QPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Alright Now he chases my bishop away? It would have been more effective earlier
464,19,13,Qc6,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1p1/2q1pn1p/8/P7/2N1B3/1PP1QPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Now the Queen is attacking the g2 square though leaving the h-pawn wide open. 
465,19,14,1Rfd1,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1p1/2q1pn1p/8/P7/2N1B3/1PP1QPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',I am getting bored so I try to enforce a rook exchange.
466,19,15,Rd8,b'3r2k1/ppp1b1p1/2q1pn1p/8/P7/2N1B3/1PP1QPPP/3R2K1 w - -',Another exchange? I guess he had some troubles with rooks in past games.
467,19,16,2Bd4,b'3b2k1/ppp3p1/2q1pn1p/8/P2B4/2N5/1PP1QPPP/6K1 b - -',I don't know what else to do!
468,19,17,2Qe5,b'6k1/ppp1b1p1/2q1pn1p/4Q3/P2B4/2N5/1PP2PPP/6K1 b - -',The only place Black can move his knight is h5 and it is always bad to put knights on the edges.
469,19,18,2a6,b'6k1/1pp1b1p1/p1q1pn1p/4Q3/P2B4/2N5/1PP2PPP/6K1 w - -',Didn't really get this move maybe just now he realized his pawn was in danger.
470,19,19,2f3,b'6k1/1pp1b1p1/p1q1pn1p/4Q3/P2B4/2N2P2/1PP3PP/6K1 b - -',The king always needs a bit of space. Plus this removes from the pressure given by the queen to g2.
471,19,20,2Qd6,b'6k1/1pp1b1p1/p2qpn1p/4Q3/P2B4/2N2P2/1PP3PP/6K1 w - -',Again trying to do a queen exchange. I have 3 options here capture move to e3 or don't bother with the queen and let it be captured still enforcing the exchange but also moving the DSB to e5.
472,19,21,2Qe3,b'6k1/1pp1b1p1/p2qpn1p/8/P2B4/2N1QP2/1PP3PP/6K1 b - -',As I mentioned before I hate Queen exchanges so I decide to bring my Queen back. The score with the system stands at +0.01 for me apparently. 
473,19,22,2c5,b'6k1/1p2b1p1/p2qpn1p/2p5/P2B4/2N1QP2/1PP3PP/6K1 w - c6',... This move forces me to either take a pawn and gain a slightly worse position or threaten the Queen so this really isn't that good.
474,19,23,Qb6,b'6k1/1p2b1p1/pq2pn1p/2p1B3/P7/2N1QP2/1PP3PP/6K1 w - -',Attacking my B-pawn again apparently.
475,19,24,2Ne2,b'6k1/1p2b1p1/pq2pn1p/2p1B3/P7/4QP2/1PP1N1PP/6K1 b - -',Well That move allowed my knight to actually move again so think something better could have been played.
476,19,25,2Kf2,b'8/1p2bkp1/pq2pn1p/2p1B3/P7/4QP2/1PP1NKPP/8 b - -',Yes I did mirror my opponents move because I really didn't want to think at the time I moved.
477,19,26,2Bd6,b'8/1p3kp1/pq1bpn1p/2p1B3/P7/4QP2/1PP1NKPP/8 w - -',I don't care if he wants to exchange go ahead.
478,19,27,2Qxe5,b'8/1p3kp1/pq2pn1p/2p1Q3/P4N2/5P2/1PP2KPP/8 b - -',At this point in the game I really started despising the Black Queen. If it were somewhere else I would have been able to capture on e6.
479,19,28,2Kg3,b'8/1p3kp1/pq2pn1p/4Q3/P1p2N2/5PK1/1PP3PP/8 b - -',The system said that this was inaccuracy. I don't see anything wrong with this move... Also this was the only time in the whole game that I went to negative anything according to what the analysis said.
480,19,29,2Qc6,b'8/1p3kp1/p1q1pn1p/4Q3/P1p2N2/5PK1/1PP3PP/8 w - -',This was also marked as inaccuracy. I don't see anything beneficial to my opponent here... Better would have been g5.
481,19,30,3h4,b'8/1p3kp1/p1q1pn1p/4Q3/P1p2N1P/5PK1/1PP3P1/8 b - h3',Pushing pawns!
482,19,31,3cxb3,b'8/5kp1/ppq1pn1p/4Q3/P4N1P/1P3PK1/6P1/8 b - -',I really thought that this game would end in a draw at this point.
483,19,32,Nd5,b'8/3q1kp1/p3p2p/Pp1nQ3/1P3N1P/5PK1/6P1/8 w - -',Now my opponent goes onto the offensive.
484,19,33,Qe7,b'8/4qkp1/p3p2p/Pp1nQ3/1P5P/3N1PK1/6P1/8 w - -',Looking at this what do you think the best move is? It may not seem like it but there is a trap here to lure the opponent into a losing state.
485,19,34,3Nc5,b'8/4qkp1/p3p2p/PpNnQ3/1P5P/5PK1/6P1/8 b - -',You probably figured this trap out already. It's very thinly hidden so it should be easy to see. To be honest I thought a player with a higher rating than mine wouldn't fall for this trap... 
486,19,35,3Nxb4,b'8/4qkp1/p3p2p/PpN1Q3/1n5P/5PK1/6P1/8 w - -',But they did. This is a really bad blunder.
487,19,36,3Qf4+,b'8/4qkp1/p3p2p/PpN5/1n3Q1P/5PK1/6P1/8 b - -',A pawn for a knight.
488,19,37,3Qxb4,b'8/4q1p1/p3p1kp/PpN5/1Q5P/5PK1/6P1/8 b - -',This was actually marked as a mistake... Well I guess Qe4+ could be considered better.
489,19,38,e5,b'8/6p1/p2q2kp/PpN1p3/1Q3P1P/6K1/6P1/8 w - -',At this point I thought there was no way I could win only draw despite the fact I was a knight up. I needed to eliminate the Queen. Then I thought of something.
490,19,39,4f5+,b'8/6p1/p2q2kp/PpN1pP2/1Q5P/6K1/6P1/8 b - -',Since my opponent had been greedy enough to take the extra pawn and fall into my trap before I considered he would this time as well. 
491,19,40,4Kxf5,b'8/6p1/p2q3p/PpN1pk2/1Q5P/6K1/6P1/8 w - -',And he did! Taking the pawn was a blunder making him lose his queen. This was a bit more concealed than the last trap.
492,19,41,4Qg4+,b'8/6p1/p2q3p/PpN1pk2/6QP/6K1/6P1/8 b - -',This is the finishing move In which Black's king is forced to move back to f6 and then with Ne4+ his Queen is gone. He promptly resigned. I hope you enjoyed this!
493,19,42,4Nxd6,b'8/8/p2N3Q/Pp1kp3/7P/6K1/6P1/8 b - -',Basic continuation.

549,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual the King's Pawn Opening is my favorite.  Why?  It can transpose into many variations including but not limited to the: Ruy Lopez Guaco Piano and Open Siclian.
550,21,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He likes to open with King's Pawn Game.  I understand that because it used to be my favorite defense before I knew about the Sicilian Defense.  In fact this is the first defense that I was taught. 
551,21,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Therefore I transpose the King's Pawn Game into the King's Knight Opening.  Why?  My goal is to play the Ruy Lopez Opening.  For this to work 2...Nc6 must be played or I cannot continue with the Ruy Lopez or Guaco Piano.

553,21,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',! This is how he responds to the Ruy Lopez.  This is actually a good move because he is developing.  In chess you are supposed to develop your pieces.
554,21,5,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I decide to take advantage by capturing his knight.  Why did I play this?  In this position I am hoping to win a free pawn since he does not have that knight to defend it 4...dxc6 5.Nxe5 and that will happen.  However I missed one important detail.  What happens if 4...Nxe4.  Then 5.Nxe5 and everything is even.  On the other hand there is a draw back.  What is it?  My king side structure is weaker.  I recently learned this in a game at the chess club.  In my game against a different member that exchange caused me to loose very quickly.  In this case I am lucky because I will win the extra pawn but I am not going to mark this an exclamation point because of what I just mentioned.
555,21,6,Qd4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4N3/3qP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He could have retaken with 6.Nxe4 but this was best.  Why?  It forks my e4 pawn and e5 knight.  Should I defend the knight or pawn?  I decide to defend the pawn.  What makes the pawn more valuable then the knight?  At first I was basing it on my game against Master elyhim so I believe that it is better to give away a free piece then a pawn.  That is because pawns usually win in the end game because they become passed pawns.  Then the passed pawns become pawn promotions and they often make a Queen.  However I missed another important fact that I did not even consider.  If I gave up my pawn instead of my piece 6...Qxe4+!! taking away my chance to castle and exposing my king throughout the duration of the game.  On the other hand this is where I start to go wrong and that will be explained later on.
556,21,7,O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4q3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',?? At this point I decide to castle before my opportunity is gone.  This is normally solid because it generally brings you a step closer to connecting the rooks and controlling the center.  However this is my loosing blunder.  Why?
557,21,8,Ng4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/4q3/4P1n1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',!! This was best due to the position.  In this position he will automatically mate in one with 8...Qxh2#.  Mate can only prevented if 8.Qxg4.  Then 8...Bxg4 loosing my Queen for his knight. At the time however I did not see 8.Qxg4 as my only option.  Therefore he will play 8...Qxh2# and that is why castling was the decisive mistake.  
558,21,9,Qxh2#,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2p5/8/4P1n1/2NP4/PPP2PPq/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',In general it is a good idea to develop and castle.  In most cases castling will benefit you.  Once in a while however castling will hurt you and might cost you the game.  That was proven in this game and it is the moral of this annotation.

706,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all; chicoboy asked me to annotate this game for him so here goes! A quick and bloody opening & midgame results in a drawn-out Rook-and-pawn endgame with lots of fodder on the board but no pieces. Enjoy!
707,29,1,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I am not aware of any particular name for this King's Pawn Game. More common is for White to bring his LSB out before blocking it in with d2-d3.
708,29,2,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"? Why spend two moves to play d2-d4? Now White has a Scotch Game position except he's behind by a move. Wasting time like this in the opening is terrifically dangerous; better was 4.Nc3 4.Be3 or 4.Be2 (of course simply playing 3.d4 would have been good too!) It's important at all stages of the game but especially the opening to ask ""why am I playing this move? What does it contribute to my longterm goals?"""
709,29,3,h3,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',? This loses a pawn for White though it's not a terrible disadvantage this early in the game since he'll retain the Bishop pair and good activity for his Queen.
710,29,4,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3nP3/3Q3P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black snatches the pawn and continues logical development.
711,29,5,c3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3nP3/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is a kind of strange move--clearly White wants to get rid of the Black Knight but it's still the opening and this is White's third pawn move that doesn't aid in his development out of only eight moves total! Better was 8.Be3.
712,29,6,1Be2,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/4P3/2PQ3P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Both sides continue to develop pieces to natural positions and prepare to castle. Black's Bishop is quite restricted but should be able to find play on the kingside whereas White's Queen is in the awkward position of being the only defender for e4.
713,29,7,1d5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/4P3/2PQ3P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQkq -',? Black overlooks the same trick that White missed six moves ago and inadvertently gives back the pawn.
714,29,8,dxe4,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2B2/4p3/4p3/2PQ3P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQkq -',?! This is an interesting variation. Rather than equalize Black has given himself a significant central/kingside pawn majority in exchange for a bit of material. After 12.Qxd8+ Rxd8 13.Bxe7 Kxe7 (keeping the Black pieces centralized and preparing to double on the d-file) White has a Bishop for two pawns. Black's pieces are slightly more active but I don't think the compensation is enough as Black has no immediate threats.
715,29,9,Nxe7,b'3rk2r/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQk -',? I would have preferred 13...Kxe7 but Black is prioritizing castling here. It's important to note that castling is frequently a strong maneuver but it is not objectively correct in all circumstances. Being a piece behind Black should be keeping the King and Knight centralized to assist in the pawn push; there is no danger of a mating attack yet from the stagnant White pieces whereas Black *must* play more energetically to have any chance of success.
716,29,10,O-O,b'3r1rk1/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP1NBPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',See above; castling is not important for Black here and in fact probably gives White an advantage (especially since this move sacrifices the important e4 pawn). A better choice would have been 14...f5! where if White plays 15.g4 Black can coolly respond with 15...g6 and soon ...Kf7 and get the pawn storm rolling before White can coordinate his pieces.
717,29,11,1O-O,b'3r1rk1/p1p1nppp/1p6/4p3/4N3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b - -',As White has a Bishop for a pawn and Black is very passive he can castle without worry--the endgame should be a win so he can simply consolidate removing his King from possible checking tactics and make ready to compound his advantages.
718,29,12,Kh8,b'3r1r1k/p1p1n1pp/1p6/4pp2/2B1N3/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',?? This move loses the exchange after 18.Ng5! where White is threatening either 19.Ne6 or 19.Nf7+ winning a Rook in either case. Better for Black was 17...Nd5.
719,29,13,1Ng5,b'3r1r1k/p1p1n1pp/1p6/4ppN1/2B5/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',! See above; this move wins material with threats of multiple forks. Black can save his Rook with 18...Rd2?! but loses any hope of counterplay after 19.Nf7+ Kg8 20.Nxe5+ Kh8 21.b4.
720,29,14,1Nd5,b'3r1r1k/p1p3pp/1p6/3nppN1/2B5/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Recentralizing the Knight but too late to be of use.
721,29,15,2Nxd8,b'3N1r1k/p1p3pp/1p3n2/4pp2/2B5/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',White takes the Rook on the open file so that he can challenge it again with 21.Rad1 and force Black to either exchange (which gives White an easy win) or spend a tempo retreating his Rook.
722,29,16,Ne8,b'4nr1k/p1p3pp/1p6/5p2/2B1p3/2P4P/PP1R1PP1/3R2K1 w - -',?? This appears to be intended to get the Knight to d6 and block the White Rooks but with the Black Rook and King so vulnerable this simply walks into a winning pin along Black's back rank. Best was 23...g5 allowing the BK to escape his prison and support his Rook from g7 as well as leaving the Knight where it defends d7.
723,29,17,2Bf7,b'3Rnr1k/p1p2B1p/1p6/5pp1/4p3/2P4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',"?? White is quite far ahead so this isn't a losing blunder but there's no reason to exchange when you can simply win the material for free! 25.Bb5! wins the Knight for nothing. As Lasker said ""when you see a good move wait--look for a better one."""
724,29,18,2Rxe8+,b'4R2k/p1p2r1p/1p6/5pp1/4p3/2P4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',White clearly has a vastly better position as this RP endgame approaches but I will continue to make occasional comments.
725,29,19,2Rdd8,b'3RR3/p1p2rkp/1p6/5pp1/4p3/2P4P/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',Doubled Rooks on the back (or 7th/2nd) rank are a fantastic way to chew through your opponent's pawns.
726,29,20,2Re6+,b'3R4/p1p2r1p/1p2R2k/6p1/4p1p1/2P4P/PP3P2/6K1 b - -',? This allows the Black King down to h5; better was to first restrain him with 29.hxg4.
727,29,21,2Kg7,b'3R4/p1p2rkp/1p2R3/6p1/4p1p1/2P4P/PP3P2/6K1 w - -',? 29...Kh5 was better gaining the h-pawn in exchange for the g-pawn and retaining some (albeit very slight) chance for counterpressure down the h-file.
728,29,22,Rf7,b'4R3/p1pR1rk1/1p5p/6p1/4p1P1/2P5/PP3P2/6K1 w - -',Probably 34...Kf6 would have been better retaining more activity for the endgame (after 35.Rf8+ Kg6 36.Rxf4 gxf4 37.Rxc7 Kg5).
729,29,23,Kf4,b'8/p1R5/1p5p/6p1/4pkP1/2P5/PP3PK1/8 w - -',Black's King is far more active than White's but there's no way to force a pawn through with that Rook drifting around on the 7th rank and the WK guarding the coronation squares.
730,29,24,Kg4,b'5R2/p7/1p6/6pp/6k1/2P5/PP3PK1/8 w - -',42...Ke4 was better; the text allows White to trap the BK on h4 with 43.f3+! and quickly clean up his remaining pawns without any worry about advancing Black pawns.
731,29,25,4Kg4,b'5R2/p7/1p4k1/6p1/6Kp/2P2P2/PP6/8 b - -',Black has lost all his activity and with it any hope for counterplay.
732,29,26,Kg8,b'6k1/8/8/6K1/p7/2P2P1R/PP6/8 w - -',? This is sort of a silly thing to do. Black is presumably hoping that White will advance pawns willy-nilly and end up with a stalemate but this move actually sets up a very simple mate in three for White (52.Kf6! a3 53.b3 Kg8 54.Rh8#). The BK needed to remain on the seventh rank as long as possible with 51...Kf7.
733,29,27,5Kg6,b'6k1/8/6K1/8/p7/2P2P1R/PP6/8 b - -',? White either does not see the mate or does not care to look for it. I expect (based on White's choices in the remainder of the game) that it is the latter but it's always best to take the simple guaranteed mate if it's there. From here on out White doesn't do anything terrible to let Black out of the mating net but he also ignores the simple KR endgame and instead goes for the promotion.
734,29,28,5c4,b'6k1/7R/6K1/8/2P5/P4P2/P7/8 b - -',Should have been mate in two: 55.Rf7 Kh8 56.Rf8#
735,29,29,6c8=Q#,b'2Q2k2/7R/3K4/8/8/P4P2/P7/8 b - -',There you have it. Perhaps a slower mate than necessary but certainly smoothly-executed by White. Black's failure to understand the urgency of keeping pieces near the central pawn structure when down in material led predictably to those pawns becoming vulnerable and falling in due course. Hope you enjoyed!

768,31,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',?? e5. This move is only good if you know what the main line is. If you don't know the main line then don't play this move. Best is simply take it with dxe5 but it leads to an interesting game. 2dxe5 Nc6 3 Nf3 Qe7 . Now this is where it is debatable if white should play Bf4 or not. Because 4 Bf4 Qb4+ which attacks both the undefended bishop and b2 but if white knows how to play this line he should simply play 5Bd2 Qxb2. It is now really tempting to play Bc3 but this is a losing blunder as black will respond with Bb4! so white should play Nc6 and white is now more developed and can exploit the open b-file by himself and will have a relative easy game. 
769,31,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But white doesn't take on e5 and wants to play a normal opening. I think d5 is better here. Also note if white played e4 the game is the same as 1 e4 e5 2 d4 which is a much more common opening game.

804,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Recently I have seen 2. Nf3 being tried but because black's strong support on d5 coupled with white's weak e pawn it can hardly be recommended. 
805,32,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is not white's best move as he does have better moves to fight for an advantage. The best move is the main line move 3. Nc3. The other common move 3. E5 posses no problems for black. Now The problem with game move is that black gets great use of the c-file and strong centre pawns and active bishops. Plus white exchanges a centre pawn for a flank pawn which is not advisable. The drawback for black is the weakness on the light squares. 
806,32,2,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The result is an unbalanced pawn structure with white on the queenside. So typical themes are a4-a5 or b4- b5 creating strong point on c5. 
807,32,3,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',There was a time when this move was considered the end of the caro-kann. However since then black has found valueable resources to defend and even fight for a win. What is blacks saving grace? Dxc4 and then attack the isolated d pawn. 
808,32,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It is important for black that d5 remain under his control at all times. Another good option for black is ...e6 when 5.Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 transposes to the QGD semi tarrash defense. But here to black is ok after 6. ...Be7. 
809,32,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? This is exactly what white is hoping black would do. This is athematic caro kann move but does little to prevent white's plans on the queen side. I t is recommended that the LSB remain close to home and gaurd the weakened light squares. I would recommend clarifying the center with 5. ...dxc4 6. Bxc4 e6 allowing for Bd6 and castling. Remember what I said at the beginning black must have control of d5 at all times. After 5. ...Bf5 he loses it. 
810,32,6,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/2PP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',a good move that puts a lot of pressure on d5 and hits at the weak b7 pawn. Take note how white is taking full advantage of the light square weakness on blacks queen side. This is a major theme in this variation of the caro kann. 
811,32,7,dxc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/5b2/2pP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',?? This losses a pawn after 7. Bxc4! e6 8. Qxb7. Best is either 6. ...Qb6 or Nbd7
812,32,8,Bxc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/5b2/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',White's advantage is getting clearer now that d5 under his control. 
813,32,9,Bg6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5nb1/8/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',very bad. Black is in serious danger of getting overrun on the queen side. 7. ...e6 was necessary in order to make room for castling and developing the DSB. Black committed to sins #1 moving a piece twice #2 abandoning the centre. Black's play here seems to suggest that he has played the caro kann in the past but I wonder if he is familiar with the exchange variation. The key to defending here is controlling c6 and d5. 
814,32,10,Nb5,b'r2qkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',?? White correctly understands that c7 is the critical square but i think he thought that Nc7 forking the king and rook wins the rook. Unfortunately for him this move saves rook because Nb5 block Ba6! Winning the rook on c8. The right idea to attack c7 is 9. Bf4!!wins after 9. ...Rc8 10.Ba6(threat win the rook) Rxc3 11.bxc3 Be4 12. Qxa7 is huge for white. 
815,32,11,Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQk -',The rook is safe no and black suddenly springs to life. 
816,32,12,1Bf4,b'2rqkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP1B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR b KQk -',?? Most young players think that brazen attacking moves defend this is rarely works in practice. Strong players always defend their pieces so 10. Be2 Be4 11. Qxa7 bxg2 12. Bf3 bxh1 13. Bxh1 is most likely a draw because of white's superiority on the light squares. 
817,32,13,1e5,b'2rqkb1r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2p3/2BP1B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQk e6',The main counter attack for black in this type of caro kann. This wins the c4 bishop. 
818,32,14,Bb4+,b'2rqk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/1bB2B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQk -',? 11. ...Be4! 12. Qxa7 Rxc4 wins a bishop for a pawn. However developing the bishop at the expense of the white king is not a bad idea. It is just not as direct. 
819,32,15,1Ke2,b'2rqk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/1bB2B2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k -',?? as bad as it looks 12. Nc3 was the best defense. 
820,32,16,1exf6,b'3qk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5Pb1/1N6/1br2B2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k -',White is done but opening the lines to your king is suicide. Best is 13.Rd1. 
821,32,17,1Rxf4,b'3qk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5Pb1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR w k -',O-O is most likely faster. 
822,32,18,1fxg7,b'3qk2r/pQ1n1pPp/6b1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k -',Maybe 14. Rd1 was more active defense. 
823,32,19,Qe1#,b'4k2r/pQ1n1pPp/6b1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP3PPP/R2Kq1NR w k -',Good finish to a well fought game for both players. 
824,33,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The caro kann defense. My early favorite. I already expect my more inexperienced opponent does not know how to play it and will be over aggressive because I saw how he played against the 2000+ player.
825,33,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This does not offer White any advantage. 
826,33,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Now Black breaks open the center.
827,33,3,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Already Black has a position that would be ideal in the Sicilian the open c file and firm control of d5.
828,33,4,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pN3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',? This is weak. Much better is to develop.
829,33,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3pN3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black does not fear the check.
830,33,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/1B1pN3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Here my opponent over estimates the value of the attack. This just helps black develop.
831,33,7,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/8/1B1p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Here White probably thinks they have the advantage. But the pin is ineffective.
832,33,8,Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/3npppp/p7/1p1p4/3P4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The White LSB will bite on granite. Black is already contemplating a minority attack.
833,33,9,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/4pppp/pn6/1p1p4/3P4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here Black wants to free the LSB as is typical in the Caro Kann.

I am very lucky to not have lost this game as you will find out in the latter half on this annotated game.

But onwards to the game at hand. White starts with the kings pawn opening very standard opening play by most players although I do believe when you start to play the 1700s+ d4 is commonly used along with c4 Nc3 Nf3 etc. 

I am not a fan of the e4 opening and not sure why I've played this it's the first time I have ever played e4 in any of my chess games on Gameknot. I must have not been paying attention."
857,34,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I don't like playing off the lines and never like to play the Sicilian as I do not know it I have never studied it due to the fact I don't play e4.
858,34,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Saying as I don't have much of an idea of how to play against the Sicilian I just play a safe move of Nc6 and try and keep things steady as possible and not make any mistakes. As I recall the Sicilian doesn't have many gambits if any at all so I can cope well enough.
859,34,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',From this move onwards Nc3 there is no main line

862,34,6,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Bd7 which I believe was so my opponent wouldn't have doubled pawns on the c file which in most cases isn't bad to have. I would have forced the Bishop/Knight trade-off as I like have doubled pawns on the c or f files.

White needs to develop probably with Be2 or Qc2.  I favor Be2 so that White can castle.

How about Bc4?  Black would then take the c-pawn.  But what if White then takes the e pawn exposing Black's Queen to the rook at c1?  Well Black could grab the pawn at a3 and still be a pawn ahead.  Maybe better if White is thinking so aggressively is to prepare with Qa4.

1009,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is another practice game in which I play the dubious Latvian Gambit and take some risks to open up an attack against a disorganized White position. The theme of this game is piece coordination and planning--Black has a very clear plan throughout the game whereas White does not and the differences in the solidity of their resulting midgame positions are substantial as a result. Enjoy!
1010,38,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The Latvian. As soon as Black makes this move he knows his general game plan: (A) break up the White center then (B) create activity in the center and on the kingside. This move in particular also shows that Black is willing to sacrifice material for that activity. 
1011,38,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',For all the reasons I don't think White should decline the Gambit in such a passive way like this see my Latvian Gambit series. 3.Nxe5 3.Bc4 3.exf5 or 3.d4 are all stronger for White but this move crops up quite often especially if White doesn't know the opening well. The problem is that it is simply too passive and lets Black get virtually everything he wants--space and time. We know Black's game plan--what is White's? This move suggests he wants to play a more positional game keeping some tension in the center rather than tearing into a kingside attack.
1012,38,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is essentially a waiting move with the benefit of holding onto e5 without blocking in the DSB by playing ...d6. If possible Black wants to play d7-d5 at once in keeping with his plan to create space and play energetically in the center.
1013,38,4,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This move seems to prepare White to play d3-d4 but why? 3.d4 was absolutely playable (last turn) and this move denies White the natural spot for his Queen's Knight after already committing to the d2-d3 move. Already White's moves feel like they lack cohesion.
1014,38,5,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4ppB1/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I don't like this move very much--Black can easily play 5...h6 and either drive the Bishop back to e3 with a gain of tempo exchange White's good Bishop for a Knight or win a piece for two pawns if 6.Bh4? White's e4 pawn was threatened but a better way to deal with it would have been 5.exf5.

Nxd5 10.Nxe5 and allows White to improve his LSB's outlook by enabling d3-d4 soon but Black needs to get his own LSB into play and remember he is willing to sacrifice material for activity. The text breaks up White's center which is one of Black's goals.
1016,38,7,c4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1n1p1/5q1p/3Ppp2/2P5/3P1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White attempts to hold on to d5 though this move weakens d4 permanently and now there's little hope of freeing White's LSB anytime soon. As I mentioned above 9.Nc4 was probably stronger.

A queenside pawn storm is not really feasible without pieces to support it. Black has been working steadily towards his goal: control the center and develop his pieces to active locations while White's plans are unclear.
1020,38,11,1Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/pp4p1/2nb1q1p/4pp2/2P5/P2P1N2/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',White seems unlikely to castle queenside with his pawns so disorderly and no pieces to support them so Black is thinking ahead to tactics against a kingside castle. As a result d6 seems like a prime spot for this Bishop rather than c5 since h2 will remain weak when White castles but f2 will be well-defended.
1021,38,12,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp4p1/2nb1q1p/4pp2/2P5/P2P1N2/1P1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black with most of his development complete and his pieces occupying comfortable posts in and around the center is clearly preparing to make his push through the center and kingside. White's pieces on the other hand have little in common except that they seem awfully cramped and don't threaten much of anything. In other words Black's pieces are coordinated and active while White's are disorderly and passive. Black's midgame plans are clear--what are White's goals?
1022,38,13,1Qb3,b'r1b2rk1/pp4p1/2nb1q1p/4pp2/2P5/PQ1P1N2/1P1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This is a good thought threatening to push to c5 with check. White has a queenside majority so seeking to activate it is a good line of thinking. The only problem with this particular move is that it blocks the b-pawn from advancing and it somewhat marginalizes the WQ. A better post might have been c2.
1023,38,14,1Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/pp4p1/2nb1q1p/4pp2/2P5/PQ1P1N2/1P1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black wants to avoid any interruptions along the a2-g8 diagonal once his attack begins. Note that 14.c5+ was not a critical threat as 14...Be6 allows Black to save his DSB but ...Be6 is not consistent with his kingside attack--Black wants that Bishop on b7 instead.
1024,38,15,1Qa4,b'r1b2r1k/p5p1/1pnb1q1p/4pp2/Q1P5/P2P1N2/1P1NBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black is clearly preparing to fianchetto his LSB--this threat is a waste of time. 15.Rfe1 may have been better or 15.Qc2.

All the while Black's forces carefully set up in coordinated strong positions from which to assault the White kingside. It also gives Black the opportunity to force White to respond to his next move...
1026,38,17,1Nd4,b'r4r1k/pb4p1/1p1b1q1p/4pp2/2Pn4/PQ1P1N2/1P1NBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black begins his attack. Both Bishops aim at the White King whereas White is in no position to make threats.
1027,38,18,1Nf3,b'r4r1k/pb4p1/1p1b1q1p/5p2/2Pp4/PQ1P1N2/1P2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',White sees Black's impending attack and begins to play inaccurately. Probably 18.Bf3 encouraging trades and activating White's bad Bishop would be more effective here but bringing the Knight to bear is certainly reasonable. White re-defends the vulnerable h2 pawn and blocks the LSB's diagonal.
1028,38,19,1g5,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b1q1p/5pp1/2Pp4/PQ1P1N2/1P2BPPP/R4RK1 w - g6',This sort of aggressive play is possible because White cannot make any threats--even against a King as seemingly exposed as Black's is.
1029,38,20,1Nd2,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b1q1p/5pp1/2Pp4/PQ1P4/1P1NBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',?? Sure this Knight will be driven away soon but make Black actually do it--White had a free tempo to use here and would have benefited from 19.Rfe1 freeing the King from his prison in the castle. Additionally this move presents Black with a simple tactic to win material for nothing...
1030,38,21,1g4,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b1q1p/5p2/2Pp2p1/PQ1P4/1P1NBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',? ...Unfortunately I missed that tactic in my rush to blast open the White castle. Best was 19...Qe5! where White must play 20.g3 to avoid mate on h2 allowing the BQ to scoop up White's Bishop for free.
1031,38,22,2Qd1,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b1q1p/5p2/2Pp2p1/P2P4/1P1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',?? The thought behind this move is sound--White wants to bring his Queen back to the action. However a preemptive 20.g3 would be better as this move gives Black enough time to really load on the pressure.
1032,38,23,2Qh4,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b3p/5p2/2Pp2pq/P2P4/1P1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',There is actually a combination here that I missed at the time which results in a more clearly won game for Black: 20...Bxh2+! 21.Kxh2 Qh4+ 22.Kg1 Bxg2! 23.Kxg2 Qh3+ 24.Kg1 Rg8 and now Black is threatening ...g3! and White must give up tremendous material to avoid mate on h2.
1033,38,24,2Nf3,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b3p/5p2/2Pp2pq/P2P1N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',?? This is the final mistake. As White had just pulled this Knight back I assumed he intended to block this threat with 21.f4 first as the followup is significantly less strong for Black after 21...gxf3 e.p. 22.Nxf3 with Black's g-pawn no longer a threat to the Knight and the WK with some more space to run. But now White is finished.
1034,38,25,Qh5,b'r4r1k/pb6/1p1b3p/5p1q/2Pp4/P2P1pP1/1P2BP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',0-1. White cannot avoid devastating material loss after 23.Bxf3 Bxf3 where the WQ must give her life for the Bishop (if she leaves the d1-h5 diagonal she no longer threatens to capture Black's Bishop and therefore nothing can prevent 24...Qh3 followed by 25...Qg2#). White's lack of clear midgame goals resulted in his forces being hopelessly disorganized without even any real interference from Black. This is why it's so very important to have clearly thought-out goals from the very start of the game--know where you're going and what your plans are and know how each move you make contributes to that plan. Thanks to chicoboy for the game and thanks for reading!
1035,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The key is to offer both sides plenty of positional troubles and goals to solve while keeping tactics alive and well. That means there should be contact and tension between the forces and the position needs some real imbalance to it positionally. If you turn it to a tactical melee it is not really about safety check but about calculation and tactical skills.
1036,39,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',By the way my opponent's USCF rating is close to 1800. Although this game was rather one sided I had to make it that way. 
1037,39,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',My opponent does not know the theory of this line which is great for me.
1038,39,3,Nxc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2N2np1/8/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Generally it is a mistake to play this kind of way allowing my center to grow more powerful. However white has a tactical idea in mind.
1039,39,4,e5,b'r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/4P3/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Now it seems that black is needing to make a tough choice as 8...Ne4 9.Bxf7+ could lead to complications. However black counter right back getting the position type we discussed before.
1040,39,5,Nd5,b'r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p3p1/3nP3/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now white pretty much has to take the d5 knight because otherwise his idea is ruined.
1041,39,6,Ba6,b'r2qk2r/p2pppbp/b5p1/3QP3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Now white has a real problem to solve- his king. Also the bishops are in contact with the white army and could attack the weaknesses. White really has no tactic chances vs black. OK black did have to sacrifice a pawn to do it but so what? White cannot promote that extra pawn. The desciption fits the typical club player who in this case is stronger than average. He likes material and highly values it so subconsciously rejected ...Nd5 as being good for white since he wins a pawn. He is willing to go through these troubles since he has the pawn. In my opinion he is fighting a losing battle. 
1042,39,7,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/p2pppbp/b5p1/3QP3/8/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black has already a completed development while white still suffers trouble. These moves for me were made very fast while the opponent is already half an hour used up.
1043,39,8,Qc7,b'1r3rk1/p1qpppbp/b5p1/3QP3/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Attack the pawn. Now white played the move he had planned on the move before without making the safety check- Not a good idea since I had foreseen this move and knew it had to be bad. 
1044,39,9,1b3,b'1r3rk1/p1qpppbp/b5p1/3QP3/2P5/1P3N2/P4PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',(??) Now black is losing immediately. Is the white player weak? Some strong players may say so but he is in the strong level if he were to play on the site probably well in the 1900/2000 range if he takes his time but it depends on how much time he uses of course. The point is that white had to concentrate so hard on his positonal troubles and failed to safety check the black ideas. This happens naturally to most club players. That is the reason for them to make these tactical blunders without being in a tactical position.
1045,39,10,1Bb7,b'1r3rk1/pbqpppbp/6p1/3QP3/2P5/1P3N2/P4PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now black is winning and the rest of the game shows the technical plan in which black consolidates material(not much of this since black is still far more active) and then starts a decisive attack winning more material.
1046,39,11,Bxg2,b'1r3rk1/p1qpppbp/6p1/4P3/2PQ1B2/1P6/P4PbP/R3K2R w KQ -',Really no need to consolidate just keep attacking since black's bishops rake the board.
1047,39,12,d6,b'1r3rk1/pq2ppbp/3p2p1/4P3/2PQ1P2/8/P2B2bP/R3K1R1 w Q -',The white's king is in the center so we should attack it by opening. This follows the idea of using ALL your advantages in a position.
1048,39,13,2Be3,b'1r3rk1/p3ppbp/3p2p1/4P3/2P1qP2/4B3/P4QbP/R3K1R1 b Q -',Now black has a nice little combination to force the win through.
1049,39,14,Bf3,b'5rk1/p3ppbp/3p2p1/4P3/2P1qP2/4BbQ1/Pr5P/R3K1R1 w Q -',White gave up since he is losing another piece.
