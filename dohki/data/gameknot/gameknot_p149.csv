In this game I seemed to be in the grip of passivitis yet again.  But suddenly out of nowhere comes an attack on Rick's king which first wins a pawn and then the exchange.  A killer pawn fork at the end brings about Rick's resignation.  So how does this happen?  Well read on.  Here is the GK analysis to help you follow this game of which starts off as a Ruy Lopez.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15252003&fb=1&rnd=0.32452067174571786"
42,1,1,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3. ..... g6 - I try an unusual variation of the Lopez to throw my Class C opponent off piste just like my Expert and Master buddies!
43,1,2,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2p1p/p1np2p1/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',5. ...... d6 - this is getting to be more like a classic Lopez set up with the exception of the kingside on which Fou Lenoir's resting place will be g7.  The usual place for that prelate is e7 in the Lopez.
44,1,3,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/1ppb1p1p/p1np2p1/4p3/B2PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',6. ...... Bd7 - pin breaker.
45,1,4,Qxd7,b'r3k1nr/1ppqnpbp/p2p2p1/3Pp3/4P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',9. ...... Qxd7 - after the bishop trade my position looks rather passive.  Having said that as typical with a Ruy Lopez white tends to lag behind in developing the queenside.  I do now have the option of leaving Henry where he is or to castle queenside.  Before making this commitment I decided to stop the incursion of a minor piece on g5 with the move h6.
46,1,5,f5,b'r3k1nr/1ppqn1b1/p2p2pp/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq f6',11. .... f5 - I think about a pawn storm.
47,1,6,g5,b'r3k2r/1ppqn1b1/p2p1n1p/3Pp1p1/2P1Pp2/2NN1P2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',14. ...... g5 - and it gathers momentum.
48,1,7,O-O,b'r4rk1/1ppq2b1/p2p1nnp/2PPp1p1/1P2Pp2/2NN1P2/P5PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',16. ..... 0-0 - I finally decided to put Henry on the kingside and then on the next move put him on h8 out of the discovery diagonal a2-g8 (the Wicked Witch of the West lands on b3 the very next move).
49,1,8,2Rxf3,b'r4r1k/1ppq2b1/p2p1nnp/2PPp3/1P2Pp2/1Q1N1R2/PB2N1PP/R5K1 b - -',20. Rxf3? - tempting recapture to avoid the kingside pawns from being split in front of the WK and to perhaps prepare a counter attack on the kingside but the drawback is - it leaves the e4 pawn hanging and my horsie on f6 makes fodder of it!
50,1,9,2Rc1,b'r4r1k/1ppq2b1/p2p2np/2PPp3/1P2np2/1Q1N1R2/PB2N1PP/2R3K1 b - -',21. Rc1?? - now the exchange drops with a knight fork on d2.
51,1,10,Nxb3,b'r4r1k/1ppq2b1/p1Pp2np/3Pp3/1P3p2/1n1N1R2/PB2N1PP/2R3K1 w - -',22. ...... Nxb3 - I decided to swipe the Witch off the board and allow Glenda to hang as there is still a WR en prise on c1.  There is no way the WP on d7 will crown so I remain a good exchange up.
52,1,11,Rad8,b'3r1r1k/1ppP2b1/p2p2np/3Pp3/1P3p2/3N1R2/P3N1PP/2B3K1 w - -',24. ....... Rad8 - I decided to corrall that little footman at once.
53,1,12,2Bd2,b'3r1r1k/1ppP2b1/p2p2np/3Pp3/1P3p2/3N1R2/P2BN1PP/6K1 b - -',25. Bd2 - I missed a pawn fork on the last move but luckily my opponent gives me a second chance.  Of course there is always B or N x P on f4 but I did calculate that I would still be considerable material up in the coming endgame and it would give me a chance to simplify further.   Gameknot Analysis thought that Rxd7 was better but Rick did not seem to think so which was the main thing because immediately after I executed the pawn fork he waved the white flag!   Amazing a winning attack comes out of nowhere from the queen of defense and passivitis jstevens1!  Anyhow hope you have all had a good read.  There is a third installment of the Pawn fork theme to come - bye for now - Joanne

Even so my question is: ""How to manage complex situations like this one?"" Which is the right pattern to follow?

Qd3 threats Rh8+ (with the queen behind) and the white rook on e2 is lost. Nice. But black can go 23... Kf7 and white can do something more? Let's go wild: 24. Ne5+ f6xN and 25. Qh5+ recovers the rook and pins e5 but loses g5 with check... it is enough? OR: 25. Rf1+ Kmoves and white can go on with the checks with the rook hanging on e2... and if the black king ever goes to d6 d5xe6+ leaves white Rd1... On the other side 24. g6+ is also a try: if 24... Ke7 or Ke8 just help because it allows Qxg7+ (and then Qxb7...) but if 24... Ke6 25. d5+ allows Kd4+ forking the rook or allows Rd1+... and white has to consider all this after 25. Qxg7 who threats Qf7+... Can you figure all the variants? I sure can't handle all this. Back to the start: Black can defend the mate with 22... Kf8 (Fritz later gave this as the correct answer for black). 23. Qh8+ Ke7 and white doesn't have anything better than 24. Qxg7 Qd6... and it's over. Ok so let's try: 23.

 (Later Fritz said this is +3.33 for white. Ne5 only +260 or so... and Qh4 gives a little inferior game for white. So I spent all this time ""for nothing"" just like Korchnoi would have done! - except he is ""a little"" better than me :-)"

I have to recognize my opponent gave me some opportunities but I am glad of my e5-e4-f5-f4-f3 moves which lead to the victory. I guess some stronger player would have found an easier way...
I am not at all convinced that I played the most decisived moves. But I liked the movement and intend to improve on this tactic."
495,15,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So he opens with the standard

502,15,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I carry on with the main line

506,15,11,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black has to do something about the White threat to take on c6 and then play e5.

508,15,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',So I carry on developing.

510,15,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',So I castle.
511,15,16,Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This is unusual too. He is hoping to follow up with e5. It is not on Gameknot's world database it is on their database of Gameknot games - although of course as this is an over-the-board game I didn't know at the time.
512,15,17,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Now this move is not in any database but it seemed quite logical to me - delay his intended e5 advance. Instead the database has 6 games with a6 one with Bd7 (white win) and one with Nxe4 (black win). The computer actually spots a tactic in this position b5 is playable.
513,15,18,1Qe2,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So he renews the threat of e5.

515,15,20,1Be3,b'r1br2k1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Computer prefers Nb5

517,15,22,1Nb5,b'r1br2k1/ppq1bppp/2npp3/1N6/2B1PPn1/4BN2/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',He attacks my queen. Computer agrees this is best.
518,15,23,1Qb8,b'rqbr2k1/pp2bppp/2npp3/1N6/2B1PPn1/4BN2/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I retreat. Computer agrees this is best.
519,15,24,1Rad1,b'rqbr2k1/pp2bppp/2npp3/1N6/2B1PPn1/4BN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',This is a logical move. I think he was planning on playing his bishop back to c1 but I decided not to give him a chance. Computer prefers c3 but for reasons I explain later I don't think c3 is a good move. I tend to think computers play tactical positions very well but strategic positions like this they are not so good. Any views?
520,15,25,1Nxe3,b'rqbr2k1/pp2bppp/2npp3/1N6/2B1PP2/4nN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',So I don't give him a chance!
521,15,26,1Qxe3,b'rqbr2k1/pp2bppp/2npp3/1N6/2B1PP2/4QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',He naturally takes back.
522,15,27,1a6,b'rqbr2k1/1p2bppp/p1npp3/1N6/2B1PP2/4QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',And now I hit the knight.
523,15,28,1Nbd4,b'rqbr2k1/1p2bppp/p1npp3/8/2BNPP2/4QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',and he retreats to the best square.
524,15,29,1Qc7,b'r1br2k1/1pq1bppp/p1npp3/8/2BNPP2/4QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',So I return the queen to its most natural square. Computer prefers a7 although I am not convinced it is any better. Any views readers?
525,15,30,1Bb3,b'r1br2k1/1pq1bppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/1B2QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 b - -',He avoids any tactics based on moving my knight and attacking his bishop on c4 at the same time. Computer prefers Nxc6 but again I am not convinced that is any better. Any views?
526,15,31,1Bd7,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/1B2QN2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',I complete the development on my minor pieces but computer prefers the immediate Na5. I don't think it makes much difference.
527,15,32,1c3,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/1BP1QN2/PP4PP/3R1RK1 b - -',I'm not a great fan of this move. Presumably the ideas are to support d4 and to give his bishop another square on c2. The disadvanatge is that black's basic plan in this position - and most other open Sicilian positions - is to launch a minority attack with the 2 black queen side pawns against the 3 white queen side pawns hopefully eventually weakening and winning a white pawn. c3 makes a target for black if black can get in b4-b5 and then exchange on c3 files are opened on the queen side white's pawns are weaker.
528,15,33,1Na5,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p2pp3/n7/3NPP2/1BP1QN2/PP4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',This is also part of the plan. Computer likes this move too!
529,15,34,1Kh1,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p2pp3/n7/3NPP2/1BP1QN2/PP4PP/3R1R1K b - -',I don't like this move either. It avoids tactics on the g1-b6 diagonal but in an endgame the white king is further from the centre.
530,15,35,1Nc4,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p2pp3/8/2nNPP2/1BP1QN2/PP4PP/3R1R1K w - -',I think this is a wonderful square to put the knight and much better than taking on b3. Computer prefers Nxb3 but I am not convinced it is any better.
531,15,36,1Bxc4,b'r2r2k1/1pqbbppp/p2pp3/8/2BNPP2/2P1QN2/PP4PP/3R1R1K b - -',So he decides to take the knight. Computer prefers Qe2 and this time I agree with computer. Computer also still thinks this position is equal.
532,15,37,1Qxc4,b'r2r2k1/1p1bbppp/p2pp3/8/2qNPP2/2P1QN2/PP4PP/3R1R1K w - -',So I recapture.
533,15,38,2b3,b'r2r2k1/1p1bbppp/p2pp3/8/2qNPP2/1PP1QN2/P5PP/3R1R1K b - -',He attacks my queen. Computer likes this move too although I am not impressed I think it weakens white's pawns.
534,15,39,2Qc5,b'r2r2k1/1p1bbppp/p2pp3/2q5/3NPP2/1PP1QN2/P5PP/3R1R1K w - -',I tend to think this is better than the retreat to c7 the computer does not agree. What do you think dear reader?
535,15,40,2e5,b'r2r2k1/1p1bbppp/p2pp3/2q1P3/3N1P2/1PP1QN2/P5PP/3R1R1K b - -',Computer likes this move.

540,15,45,2bxc4,b'2rr2k1/3bbppp/p2pp3/2q1P3/2p2P2/1P2QN2/P1N3PP/3R1R1K w - -',"I thought that this gave me a won ending although computer prefers d5 and assesses the position as ""black has the upper hand""."

542,15,47,2dxc5,b'2rr2k1/3bbppp/p3p3/2p1P3/2p2P2/1P3N2/P1N3PP/3R1R1K w - -',Computer actually prefers the recapture with the pawn and thinks black is 1.56 ahead. This seems much easier to me the bishops are getting into play on the queen side with a vengence! Any views dear reader?
543,15,48,2bxc4,b'2rr2k1/3bbppp/p3p3/2p1P3/2P2P2/5N2/P1N3PP/3R1R1K b - -',so he recaptures.

547,15,52,2Ne3,b'3r2k1/4bppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/4NN2/P5PP/5R1K b - -',and he has to do something about the attacked knight.
548,15,53,2Rd3,b'6k1/4bppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/3rNN2/P5PP/5R1K w - -',obvious and good!
549,15,54,2Re1,b'6k1/4bppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/3rNN2/P5PP/4R2K b - -',This is the best move for him
550,15,55,2Bd8,b'3b2k1/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/3rNN2/P5PP/4R2K w - -',Computer actually prefers Bc6 with the idea of taking on f3 but I think it is better to play this my bishops are so good! Any views?
551,15,56,2Re2,b'3b2k1/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/3rNN2/P3R1PP/7K b - -',Protecting the 2nd rank but Kg1 is better.
552,15,57,2Ba5,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/b1p1P3/b1P2P2/3rNN2/P3R1PP/7K w - -',So into play!
553,15,58,3Ne1,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/b1p1P3/b1P2P2/3rN3/P3R1PP/4N2K b - -',I tend to think he is so tied up this position is won for black whatever he plays.
554,15,59,3Rc3,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/b1p1P3/b1P2P2/2r1N3/P3R1PP/4N2K w - -',I had to move my rook of course.
555,15,60,3Nf3,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/b1p1P3/b1P2P2/2r1NN2/P3R1PP/7K b - -',He just repeats.
556,15,61,3Rc1+,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/b1p1P3/b1P2P2/4NN2/P3R1PP/2r4K w - -',So I throw in a check.

558,15,63,3Bc3,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1P2P2/2b1N3/P3R1PP/2r3NK w - -',and this is heading for a massive square on d4 where it will attack on both sides.

562,15,67,3Rc3,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1Pb1P2/2r1N2P/P3R1PK/6N1 w - -',I attack his knight again.
563,15,68,3Rb2,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1Pb1P2/2r1N2P/PR4PK/6N1 b - -',He threatens a back rank mate. It was worth a try I guess but he is losing co-ordination between his pieces.
564,15,69,3Kf8,b'5k2/5ppp/p3p3/2p1P3/b1Pb1P2/2r1N2P/PR4PK/6N1 w - -',I avoid the mate!

While I've gotten rolled up by very strong players who sally this opening against me the move itself has never impressed me as a particularly strong one; and of course I'd expect a very strong player to roll me up anyway now matter whether they play this move or not and no matter what my reply to 2. Bg5 might be.
643,19,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',And so I reply to White's impudent 2. Bg5 here the way I always do by thumbing my nose it it. If White wants to swap a perfectly good bishop for a Knight right out of the gate he's more than welcome to.
644,19,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Six of one half a dozen of the other... The alternatives here are numerous. Stereotypical would be 3. c4 but Bf6 Nf3 g3 or e3 are also all quite playable. The attractive point of the text move is that it looks to begin an attack immediately. Of course that's usually a course frought with risk no matter who initiates it; but on the other hand such games are almost always fun to play over and analyze.
645,19,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',"A challenging move as we'll see. The most prudent reply was 3. ...d5. But this is unrated skittles: and who wants to play ""prudently"" against a C-player when there's exciting chess to be had? Black thumbs his nose at White for the second time in as many moves saying ""Show me what you've got!"""

Black has to make a decision now to drive off the Knight with ....c6; or to play the Bishop back to d6 to guard the e-pawn and threaten ...e5 if White plays Bf4. The latter continuation is certainly the correct choice but I guess I wasn't in a mood for making ""correct choices."" And so ..."
648,19,6,Kd8,b'rnbk3r/pppnp2p/5pp1/3N4/5P2/8/PPP2P1P/3RKBNR w K -',Admittedly all the preceding looks just odd and unforced. But let's stop and take a look at the position for a second: White has a lead in development true but his developed pieces have no coordination and his Kingside pawn structure is blown to hell only 11 moves into the game. Black on the other hand has no weaknesses except the for-now unexploitable hole at e6 and the xray on his King. But after 12. ...c6 followed by ...Kc7 and ...Nb6 the xray disappears and Black is left with Kingside pawns he can quickly mend (and solid pawns after that) and his development will quickly catch up. What's not to like?
649,19,7,Nb6,b'r1b4r/ppk1p2p/nnp2pp1/8/5P2/2N2N2/PPP2PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black has nearly completed the full repair of his position. White had better think of something constructive to do quickly or he's just going to drift into a very difficult endgame.
650,19,8,Bf5,b'r3r3/ppk1p2p/nnp2pp1/5b2/3N1P2/2N5/PPP2PBP/3RR1K1 w - -',White has chosen the most active plan and now Black acknowledges it offering to spoil his own pawns to get rid of one of the pesky White Knights. The move 17. ...Nc5 is met with 18. b4.
651,19,9,e5,b'r3r3/ppk4p/nnp2p2/4pp2/5P2/2N4B/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 w - e6',The check 19. ...Rg8 does nothing except help White challenge for the g-file after Kh1 ... Rg1 so the plan is to sac a pawn for some play in the center.
652,19,10,Rad8,b'3rr3/ppk4p/nnp5/4pB2/8/2N5/PPP2P1P/3RR1K1 w - -',Black has been walking a tightrope with his play and now sacrifices a pawn to keep his pieces active: White's Rooks must be challenged before they unite on a file.
653,19,11,Nc5,b'8/ppk1r3/1np5/2n1pB2/8/2N5/PPP2P1P/3R2K1 w - -',Although this Knight is heading for the Kingside to help with both defense and attack there the immediate purpose of the move was to delay White from playing Ne4.
654,19,12,2a4,b'8/ppk1r3/1np1n3/4pB2/PP6/2N5/2P2P1P/3R2K1 b - a3',White continues to play actively for the win. And why not? He's a pawn up and has a Bishop for a Knight. But Black is far from helpless in this position.
655,19,13,Nc8,b'2n5/ppk1r3/2p5/P3pB2/1P3n2/2N5/2P2P1P/3R2K1 w - -',Exchanges just ease Black's defensive chore especially if White gives up his powerful Bishop. The move 27. ...Nc4 also looks at d6 for the Knight but the text presents White with an immediate temptation. Meanwhile 27. ...Nbd5 just exchanges a Knight-pair or is met with 28. Ne4 followed by the mobilization of White's Queenside pawns.. My play here is ironically to offer White a number of plausible moves at each turn but none of which is great the better to help him go astray in the subtleties of the variations.
656,19,14,2Bxc8,b'2B5/ppk1r3/2p5/P3p3/1P3n2/2N5/2P2P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Oh well this is just bad. White gets absolutely nothing but the loss of his Bishop from this unforced exchange and so should have played 28. Ne4 instead with the idea of Ng3! both covering the King and helping to support the advance of White's Kingside pawns. This is a finesse that many players - even good ones! - miss at times: a Knight on a square where it cannot be attacked with a pawn is just about golden no matter where that post is. Case in point: Black's Knight on f4 is very well-placed and will be difficult to dislodge.
657,19,15,Rh7,b'2k5/pp5r/2p5/P3p3/1P2Nn2/8/2P2P1P/3R2K1 w - -',...Waiting.

663,19,21,3Nd6+,b'2k2r2/pp6/2pN4/P3p3/1P3n2/8/2P2P1P/3R1K2 b - -',Another wasted move since White has no constructive follow-up.
664,19,22,3b5,b'5r2/ppk5/2pN4/PP2p3/5n2/8/2P2P1P/3R1K2 b - -',Still playing for the win. But the text is toothless. White should have played 36. c4 instead.
665,19,23,3Nc4,b'5r2/ppk5/2p5/PP1np3/2N5/8/2P2P1P/3R1K2 b - -',White blocks the threat but has to hem in his c-pawn to do it. Black consistently takes advantage of these small miscues by White steadily improving his position with each one.
666,19,24,3e4,b'5r2/ppk5/2p5/PP1n4/2N1p3/8/2P2P1P/3R1K2 w - -',Of course 37.. ...cb5 is spoiled by 38. Rd5. The text threatens 38. ...e3! Black begins to assert himself now
667,19,25,3Ke1,b'5r2/ppk5/2p5/PP1n4/2N1p3/8/2P2P1P/3RK3 b - -',Rather unhappy is 38. Kg1 Nc3  39. Re1 (not Rd4?? Ne2 winning) cb5 after which Black's Queenside pawns are at least as good as White's Kingside pawns.
668,19,26,Rxh2,b'8/p1k5/2p5/P2n4/4p3/8/2PN1P1r/3RK3 w - -',Better was  40. ...Nf6! guarding the e-pawn while still pocketing White's h-pawn.
669,19,27,Rh4,b'8/p1k5/2p5/P2n4/4N2r/8/2P2P2/3RK3 w - -',But Black's 40th move was not a mistake per se because now he makes hay against White's Queenside pawns.
670,19,28,Rc4,b'8/p1k5/2p5/P1Nn4/2r5/8/2P2P2/3RK3 w - -',White is now clearly on the defensive even though he is material up.
671,19,29,4Nb3+,b'8/p7/2p5/P1kn4/2r5/1N6/2P2P2/3RK3 b - -',Rather than repeating moves with another check at e6 White is *still* playing to win! Good fighting spirit!
672,19,30,Ke5,b'8/p7/2p5/P2nk3/2r5/1N6/2PR1P2/4K3 w - -',With White's Rook hemmed in on the 2nd rank like that Black's King can immediately initiate defensive action on the Kingside.
673,19,31,4Kf1,b'8/p7/2p5/P2nk3/2r5/1N6/2PR1P2/5K2 b - -',A slightly puzzling move since 47. Re2+ at least threatens Re8-a8 menacing the only exploitable square in Black's camp the pawn at a7.
674,19,32,4c5,b'8/p7/8/P1pnk3/2r5/1N6/2PR1P2/5K2 w - -',Now 48. Re2 Kd6  49. Re8 Nc7 guarding the a8 square after which White can play his Rook back to e2 or defend the c-pawn by playing Na1 - yuck!
675,19,33,Rc4,b'8/p7/8/P1pnk3/2r5/1N5K/2PR1P2/8 w - -',The White King can't support the advance of the f-pawn if it can't get adjacent to it.
676,19,34,Nf6,b'8/p7/5n2/P1p1k3/8/1Nr2PK1/2PR4/8 w - -',Threatening the fork on e4. Black's tactical resources seem to appear almost by magic each time he needs them. Not only that but now the Knight guards the weakness at e8 too.
677,19,35,Kf5,b'8/p7/5n2/P1p2k2/8/1Nr2PK1/2P1R3/8 w - -',Now it's Black's turn to be too aggressive: the e7 square is wide open.
678,19,36,5Rd2,b'8/p7/5n2/P1p2k2/8/1Nr2PK1/2PR4/8 b - -',Oh my I guess he just didn't see it! After 53. Re7 Rc2  54. Ra7 White is winning.

Most commentary is by Yasser Seirawan.  ((Comments from Wikipedia entry on this game are in double parentheses.))

The Garry Kasparov versus Deep Blue match had all the drama of a great epic. Going into the last game with the match tied the expectation and excitement had reached fever pitch. My audience had just begun to warm their seats when the game was over! In just over one hour the match was over and we were all left gasping for answers. I hope these comments provide some crucial clues to the most gripping chess event that I've ever had the pleasure to be involved with.

Therefore the text. However the effect of White's move had a devastating effect on Garry's face. He looked as if he had just been hit by a bolt of lightening. While we were busily speculating if Kasparov had come prepared with a novel idea his reaction was manifestly clear he had
transposed his move order and fallen into a well known book trap! How on earth was this possible? Garry Kasparov is arguably the finest opening theoretician in the world today. How could he fall into a known opening trap? There are several answers. In the post match press conference Garry explained that he had lost his confidence. Following the disappointing draw in game five he had told his trainers that ""The match was over."" Garry had simply given up and went into the game with a losing mentality.
Too Garry had exhibited signs of increasing nervousness and tension following game two. Playing openings and defenses that were unfamiliar to him he had hoped to out fox the computer. He had done so but also achieved positions that didn't suit him.
Following the look of appall on his face following the text Garry clinched his head in his hands looked plainly disgusted and banged down his next move swiftly.

(( The computer is aided by having this knight sacrifice programmed into the opening book. This move had been played in a number of previous high-level games with White achieving a huge plus score. However had Deep Blue been on its own it would probably not have played this. The compensation White gets for the material is not obvious enough for the computer to see by itself. As an indication of how far computer chess has progressed in recent years modern chess programs running on ordinary desktop computers do find Ng5xe6 without their opening books. ))"

Previous games have seen 11...Qb4 trying to make room for his pieces. But these games also have resulted in Black losses.
The purpose of the text is to secure the d5-square for a Black Knight when it can't be dislodged by c2-c4. A noble aim except that it simply does not work. There is no question that Black faces difficulties but the computer's approach to winning the game is quite different from a human's. Essentially the computer looks at each position as if it were unique. It doesn't have prejudices about previous ideas but tries to play the best move according to its evaluation and its thinking.
Take another look at the position before the text move. In general it is good to win a Queen for Rook and Bishop. A computer is correctly programmed to think that winning a Queen for Rook and Bishop is a good thing. White can play Rf1-e1 and Bg6-f5 in order to win the e7-Queen. Also the computer likes to win pawns and could play for Rf1-e1 and Qd1-e2xe6 when in both cases Black is relieved by the trades. If White is given the opportunity to carry out either of these operations it is definitely in Black's interests to let him!

With the text Kasparov weakens his entire Queenside structure and allows White to develop his a1-Rook. What were his choices? Well 11...Nd5 12.Bg3 Qf6 13.Bh4 definitely fails. And
no one wants to play Black after 11...Nd5 12.Bg3 N7f6 13.Ne5 when White has too many threats. In the past 11...Qb4 hasn't worked so another strategy has to be found. An anti-computer strategy. Kasparov facing a difficult position has to let the computer bail him out!
My suggestion is to do little! Black should draft his Queenside into the game while trying to induce Deep Blue to win material. Of course I can't guarantee such a strategy would work! This then is my suggestion: 11...a5!! (Two exclaims for understanding the opponent is a computer.) 12.Re1 (12.a4!? b6 13.c4 Ba6 14.Rc1 Kc8 is Black's basic idea given the chance he wants to play ...Kc8-b7 and try to hold on.) 12...a4 13.Qe2 b5 14.Qxe6?! Qxe6 15.Rxe6 Nb6 16.Rxc6 Nbd5 intending ...Bc8-d7 when we see Black's idea in full bloom. If in the above line we see the following: 11...a5 12.Re1 a4 13.Bf5 (as in the game) 13…exf5 14.Rxe7 Bxe7 Black is in great shape. He is about to coordinate his pieces and he has a material advantage. These lines demonstrate how Deep Blue could easily go wrong.
Its highest priorities are to win material. In both cases Deep Blue is doing what it is told (Don't forget it was told to sacrifice a Knight!) and winning material. If the result is that Deep Blue gets a bad game that is just the way it goes. The real bad news about the text is that it tells Deep Blue exactly what to do open up the queenside."

White. Still Kasparov's resignation was premature to say the least. I had expected Kasparov to dig in his heels and fight. But he had no fighting spirit and simply gave up. Following his resignation there was a sudden and complete emptiness in the spirit of the people in the auditorium. All the buildup up in tensions had been sucked out as if in a vacuum. We were all in disbelief and shock. IBM had done it. They had created a computer program that defeated the world's highest rated human. It was a watershed event and an extraordinary moment in time. Kasparov seemed utterly dazed.

Press Conference:
Garry appeared in the press center shortly after the last game had finished so disastrously for him. He took his seat next to IBM team leader C.J. Tan and looked grimly up into the air till it was his time to speak. Monty Newborn tried to introduce Kasparov's team but Garry stopped him: ""My team doesn't need to be recognized. Deep Blue's team does."" C.J. Tan thanked Garry ""A brave man to participate in this great experiment."" C.J. Tan continued The computer played grandmasterly chess. Where do go from here? We will continue to work with Garry but perhaps on a less competitive level."" Garry's response: ""The competition has just started."" Garry started off with: ""I have to apologize for the performance today. The match was lost by the World Champion with very good reason."" Garry elaborated on the loss of the match that game two had been crucial. ""It was beyond my understanding the moves Deep Blue played. It plays a move like Be4 but misses Qb6. All the print-outs of game 1 - 6 should be published. I have no idea what was happening behind the curtains. I'm ashamed I lost this match since the machine had too many weaknesses. I want to understand how Deep Blue won the match. I want to look at the print-outs. The computer still has generic problems and the way to prove that this was not a single event - that the computer has a great mind is for Deep Blue to enter competitive chess. Make IBM a player not a sponsor.""
Garry was asked if he was suggesting that IBM had been cheating on him. He replied: ""I'm suggesting many things happened well beyond my understanding and it should be tested on other machines to see if they show up with the same kind of answers."" Garry about game 6: ""The best player in the world cracked down under pressure. After the computer takes on e6 (8.Nxe6) I can resign. I didn't feel like playing. I'm human. What happened in the previous games was beyond my understanding and I was scared."" Garry won't mind to play another match against Deep Blue but one of the conditions he already stated is: ""Only when IBM is not the sponsor."

1043,33,48,2Bc4,b'2kr3r/3b2pp/8/p7/2Bb1BP1/2N4K/PP5P/5R2 b - -',"My favorite chess game is an underrated less-known game called the ""Peruvian Immortal"" by Esteban Canal.  It was played at a simultaneous exhibition in Budapest in 1934 against an unknown opponent.  (It is analyzed on this site as well.)  It has been compared favorably to Anderssen's ""Immortal Game"" since Canal played this at a simultaneous exhibition and may have spent about five minutes thinking about this.  It features after 13 moves White (Canal) having sacrificed both rooks and his queen.  He then pulls Boden's Mate on the 14th move.  I all of a sudden saw Black's king in a suitable formation and half of the bishop formation already set up for me and thought of the surprise ending to that game.  I decided on this move in order to set up the mate in the next move and pray that Black didn't see it."

1050,34,4,1Qb5,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/4q3/pQp5/4p3/1PP1P3/P4PPP/2KR3R b - -',This doesn't stop a4 but it at least makes it a bit more complicated and I need more complications to make up for my weaker position.

My other choice to protect my kingside is Qe2 and I'm bottled in and really don't protect the kingside all that well. So I'll let him double my pawns. He can't immediately take advantage of them and he may run into trouble if he chooses the wrong way to get them.
Probably his best choice after trading the queens is to put his rooks on a5 and a8 while I put mine on d6 and d1.

Only thing I could see is that he's going to go play Qf6 and my pawn on c3 will be pinned. Maybe I should ask it the other way around: is there any advantage to going to b2 over a2? The king guards the rook from b2 but that queen's not going to be attacking it after this move. The king guards c1 after I move the rook but I imagine he's going to try to keep his rook on that open e-file.

1089,35,32,2Nd4,b'br4k1/p4rpp/4p3/1pq1Pp2/2pN4/2P5/Q2R1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',? this was another very poor move. infact I don't know weather he missed it or not but Black could have just taken the e pawn.
1090,35,33,Qxe5,b'br4k1/p3r1pp/4p3/Qp2qp2/2pN4/2P5/3R1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',"! my position looks bad but is even worse than it looks. Black has many threats here.

I took a very long time with my next move. I had only just realised my back rank was weak."
1091,35,34,2Nxb5,b'br4k1/p3r1pp/4p3/QN2qp2/2p5/2P5/3R1PPP/1R4K1 b - -',?? This was a very had decision to make. This move means black wins!
1092,35,35,2Qe4,b'br4k1/p3r1pp/4p3/QN3p2/2p1q3/2P5/3R1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',!! Now mate is unavoidable. I was about to resign here when I found one last tactic.  I saw no way out of checkmate since black had mate threats on both g2 and b1! what I came up with was although makes no difference commendable and offers the best resistance and even a winning game if black makes the wrong move. 
1093,35,36,2Rd8+,b'br1R2k1/p3r1pp/4p3/QN3p2/2p1q3/2P5/5PPP/1R4K1 b - -',This offers the only resistance even if it still losses the game. What I found was ...Rxd8 Qxd8+ Kf7 then Nd6+!! unfortunately what I missed was that once I move my knight a third mate threat is opened up so black had no need to make the move 27. ...Rxd8. It turns out much to my displeasure that checkmate beats a queen any day of the week.
1094,35,37,2Kf7,b'br1R4/p3rkpp/4p3/QN3p2/2p1q3/2P5/5PPP/1R4K1 w - -',After this I relised my final oversight and was about to resign. I chose instaed to go out in style by at least taking out Blacks queen.
1095,35,38,Kg6,b'br1R4/p3r1pp/3Np1k1/Q4p2/2p1q3/2P5/5PPP/1R4K1 w - -',If black had moved his king to f6 then I still would have been in the game since Nxe4 would have come with a game winning check.
1096,35,39,Rxb1+,b'b2R4/p3r1pp/4p1k1/Q4p2/2p1N3/2P5/5PPP/1r4K1 w - -',Hope you enjoyed this game. I would really appreciate peoples insight into this because their was a point where the position is a little too complicated for me to figure out the correct moves.

I wasn't brave enough to try e5 to force him to play fxe5 and I'd have an open file to attack that weak pawn on e3."

1104,36,6,Nb4,b'r1b2rk1/p4p1p/1p4p1/1BNp4/1n3P2/8/PPPR2PP/2K4R w - -',Seems like the only place I can put the knight. I thought about Ne7 and after we trade knights then I can play d4 but I lose a pawn after Bc6.

This move will leave me doubled pawns if he trades but I'll be guarding the d-pawn from the side and may get to use the a-file and he may have to use a pawn to eventually trade off my doubled pawn."

That's (one of) the problem with an isolated queen pawn. The further into the game you get the weaker it becomes and harder to defend."

1109,36,11,Bg4,b'8/5p2/1p2rkp1/p6p/1PPR1Pb1/P4B2/3K2PP/8 w - -',"When is it okay to not make the best move? When you know that the best move leads to a loss. He's going to trade the pawns on the queenside and have an outside passed pawn and that's the game. Probably the best move is Kd7.
But if there's any hope for me I've got to stir things up and cause some trouble. So it's time to make a less than best move."
