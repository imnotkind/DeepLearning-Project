72,2,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White's motive is clear. Assault on f7.

139,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The biggest mistake beginners make in chess to develope the queen to early. Normally when the queen comes out the other player may develope for free by attacking it which results in a early offensive buried by a flood of enemy pieces. But in this case it works and I´m going to try here to explain why. 
140,4,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Up till this point this has been a standard queen´s pawn opening I think this variation is called the Keres Defense. Black however makes an early mistake here. White will not take this pawn as it will obstruct black´s developement to no end. 
141,4,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move is also bad. Black is utterly clogged. No knights are out. His f8 bishop is bottled up. Worse his c8 bishop is in no position to do anything. In this situation white can exploit the clog by Qa4 since black has no means to threaten it. 
142,4,3,Qa4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/Q1P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Black is now in deep trouble. His white bishop is trapped. He has to get a piece out on the board other than a pawn. Perhaps Qf6 is the best option for black here since it forces white to play defense on the right side and at least slows down the pressure. 
143,4,4,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I have no idea why black did this. Bg5 would immediately be taken the queen. The threat is to black´s left side not the right. 
144,4,5,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pbpp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Black latches unto a stratedgm here. Since he can´t get at the queen he´s going to get the king to opposite side of the board. Then he can finally move his d pawn and roll the queen back. 
145,4,6,f4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pbpp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P2P2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq f3',Black needs to get the knight out and this slows that down. If he moves the knight white takes pawn and the knight has to move again instead of being able to castle.

148,4,9,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/5n1p/2pP4/Q1P2B2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black is still committed to castling. Unfortunately BxF4 prevents that. Notice here that in 4 moves since the queen is out and black still hasn´t been able to threaten it. As an asside in chess it pays to jettison fixed plans. Qb6 needed to happen. Castling looks tempting but black needs to put pressure on white´s line. 
149,4,10,d6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/3P1n1p/2p5/Q1P2B2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Oh dear. Qb6 no longer the move you want to make. Nb5 cuts it off and the pawn prevent traps black´s queen. But there isn´t much by way of alternatives. Any move other than Qb6 and the bishop is toast. pull the bishop back and his castling plan is derailed.

However this basically gives white an opportunity to pick up more material by realizing check. Black should have taken the pawn which still gives him the power to bring the rook into play. And he can easily pull the king back to 8 file in case of check which white could not have attempted anyway.

Moral of the story. Opening with the queen can be good provided black cannot threaten it. In fact a queen in an unreachable spot gives white a lot of good attacking options. Another good moral here is the importance of paying attention in the opening. Manage those pawns carefully keep the files open to get the bishops or knights in a way that is helpful!

222,8,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The upcoming battle will revolve on the liability white takes on c4.
223,8,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White immediately aims to recapture.
224,8,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White foregoes the recapture and the choice might be permanent.
225,8,3,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/4bn2/8/2pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black's grip on c4 is strong.  White has spent many pawn moves strengthening the dark squares so he cannot easily trade away his light square bishop with 5.Bxc4 Bxc4 6.Qa4+ recapturing with check.
226,8,4,Qa4+,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/4bn2/8/Q1pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Fritz believes that Nf3 is worth a look.  It at least creates some central pressure that black cannot immediately neutralize.  Also worth a look is g3 pressuring the a7-g2 diagonal.  For example 5.g3 Bd5?! 6.Nxd5 Qxd5 7.Nf3 and white has an easy plan for completing his kingside development.
227,8,5,Qd7,b'rn2kb1r/pppqpppp/4bn2/8/Q1pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Now white is not so much in trouble but has to be careful when the potential of his position can begin to be overshadowed by black activity.
228,8,6,Qb4,b'rn2kb1r/pppqpppp/4bn2/8/1QpP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I think that the queen exchange may have been called for but such an early exchange calls into question either Qa4 or allowing the c pawn to fall.
229,8,7,b3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/2q1bn2/8/1QpP4/1PN1P3/P4PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',White offers black bait which will allow Bb5 pinning the black queen to the king.
230,8,8,Na6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1bn2/8/1QpP4/1PN1P3/P4PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',White will now have to move the Queen a third time in the opening.  Black's position is improving while white's position stalls.  Black is better.
231,8,9,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1bn2/8/2pP4/QPN1P3/P4PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',And suddenly the bait pawn is fair game and proves pivotal for black.
232,8,10,Nf3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1bn2/8/2pP4/QPN1PN2/P4PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',Perhaps too late.  Ne5 can exert some influence but can it compensate for the tempi that black gains?
233,8,11,cxb3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1bn2/8/3P4/QpN1PN2/P4PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',What does white have for the two pawns?  Owing to Be6 Qxb3 is inelligible.  10.axb3 drops the knight.  Not even 10 moves in and black has gone from better to clearly winning.
234,8,12,bxa2,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1bn2/8/3P4/Q1N1PN2/p2B1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',White is trying to avoid losing more time by delaying moving the bishop on f1 but the delay is keeping his king in the center of the board.
235,8,13,Ne4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1b3/8/3Pn3/Q3PN2/N2B1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black feels no need to exchange and chooses an active position.
236,8,14,1Nb4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/n1q1b3/8/1N1Pn3/Q3PN2/3B1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The move forces a trade but how strong the idea is is debatable.
237,8,15,1Qxa7,b'2kr1b1r/Qpp1pppp/2q1b3/8/1n1Pn3/4PN2/3B1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',My first thought was Bxb4 pressuring e7 and buying white time.  The white idea seems to be 14.Qa8+ Kd7 15.Ne5+ Ke8 16.Qxd8+ Kxd8 17.Nxc6+ cxc6 but white misses black's next move.
238,8,16,1Nc2+,b'2kr1b1r/Qpp1pppp/2q1b3/8/3Pn3/4PN2/2nB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Suddenly white seems to have dropped two pieces without sufficient compensation.

246,9,3,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1bppp/1qn1pn2/8/3P4/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',?? This loses my queen in an amateur fashion!

248,9,5,Nxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/N2n4/3B4/PPPB1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',I almost resigned at this point. Sometimes though it only seems right to make someone earn his win. I've lost at this point.

252,9,9,1Qg3,b'r4rk1/pbp1bpp1/1pn1p2p/8/4N3/2PB2Q1/PP3PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Getting his queen into play. Really though I think he should move his pieces forward since he's +5.
253,9,10,f5,b'2r2rk1/pbp1b1p1/1pn1p2p/5p2/4N3/2PB1PQ1/PP4PP/1R3RK1 w - f6',An aggressive move that leaves a weakpoint at e6. At this point losing a pawn is not so bad what I'm worried about is losing control of my kingside.
254,9,11,Bd6,b'2r2rk1/pbp3p1/1pnbp2p/5p2/8/2PB1PQ1/PP3NPP/1R3RK1 w - -',Bc5 gets kicked out by b4 and is not really a threat since I'm unwilling to exchange minor pieces.
255,9,12,Ne5,b'2r2rk1/pbp3p1/1p1bp2p/4np2/7Q/2PB1P2/PP3NPP/1R3RK1 w - -',At this point my position is better as I have control but it is still imbalanced.

259,9,16,2Bg4,b'2r2rk1/p1p3p1/1p1bp2p/4np2/6bQ/2P4N/PPB3PP/1R3RK1 w - -',Maybe it was better to keep him on the long diagonal as it gives the white king more pressure. Comment if it seems better.
260,9,17,2Nf4,b'2r2rk1/p1p3p1/1p1bp2p/4np2/5NbQ/2P5/PPB3PP/1R3RK1 b - -',Maneuvering his knight into position. The main problem is that his pieces are not working together there needs to be more cooperation and less passivity.

265,9,22,Bxf4,b'2r3k1/p1p5/1p2prnp/5p2/5bP1/2P3Q1/PPB3P1/1R4K1 w - -',Material is now equal. My pieces are better placed though but my king is somewhat open as his pawns are gone.

267,9,24,Bg5,b'5rk1/p1p5/1p2prnp/5pb1/6P1/2P3PQ/PPB5/1R4K1 w - -',Be3+ is unneccesary. His king is good where it is at.
268,9,25,3Rf1,b'5rk1/p1p5/1p3rnp/5pb1/8/2P3PQ/PPB5/5RK1 b - -',At this point Ne7 seems like the only move.
269,9,26,3f4,b'5rk1/p1p5/1p3rnp/6b1/5p2/2P3PQ/PPB5/5RK1 w - -',!? The final battle. My f pawn advances instead of putting my knight into the 7th rank. He is just what I need to finish off the kingside protection. 33. Bxg6 Rxg6 34. gxf4 Bxg4+ and my position looks OK. My analysis was not solid at this point it just seemed like the right stab.
270,9,27,Nxf4,b'5rk1/p1p5/1p3r1p/6b1/5n2/2P4Q/PPB5/5RK1 w - -',Now things are cooking. I am threatening Ne2+/Nh3+ followed by Rxf1+ so his queen must protect both squares.
271,9,28,Kh8,b'5r1k/p1p5/1p3r1p/6b1/5nQ1/2P5/PPB5/5RK1 w - -',Removing the pin. Ne2+/Nh3+ leaves us with a different colored bishop draw. At least now he is the one fighting for a draw! I was playing with the idea of 35. ... h5 36. Qxg5 Nh3+
272,9,29,3Rxf4,b'5r1k/p1p5/1p3r1p/6b1/5RQ1/2P5/PPB5/6K1 b - -',?? The position cannot take this and he does not have the material to sacrifice. Maybe he was hoping to land his queen on h7 but that will not work because of...
273,9,30,3Qh3,b'5r1k/p1p5/1p5p/6b1/5r2/2P4Q/PPB5/6K1 b - -',...my threat to take his bishop! Rf1+ followed by R1f2+. His queen must defend f1!
274,9,31,3Rf4f3,b'5r1k/p1p5/1p5p/6b1/8/2P2r1Q/PPB5/6K1 w - -',! I don't give myself exclamation marks lightly in general my moves aren't worthy of them but this is the final blow. The bishop is lost and he now needs to fight for perpetual check g2 is the only square to defend the bishop but that is not good because...
275,9,32,Be3+,b'5r1k/p1p5/1p5p/8/8/2P1br2/PPB3Q1/6K1 w - -',And the game is over.

En mi modesta opinión cuando evalúan así están más cerca del empate que de cualquier otra cosa admitiendo que hay que avanzar muchas jugadas para concretar dicho empate (analizando variantes y subvariantes posibles).  Sin embargo el problema no es tanto ese. Para mi el problema de las máquinas es cuando dan ""clara ventaja a un bando"" como en este caso y luego se demuestra que son tablas y que la clara ventaja no es concluyente como para ganar la partida. Ese tipo de evaluación es de mayor trascendencia que el otro y necesita de ser valorado por los programadores.

331,12,1,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',A very aggressive move by White. This is now the Scotch Game.
332,12,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A position not usually seen in competitive play.
333,12,3,Bxc3+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/8/4P3/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White's only logical response is to take with the pawn. While this results in doubled pawns Black will have to double his pawns as well in order to take the knight.
334,12,4,bxc6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',There is now a completely empty file on the queenside which could be useful in an attack by either player.
335,12,5,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/p1ppqppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The position is fairly balanced though Black's bishop is doing little on c8 in comparison to either of White's bishops.
336,12,6,Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/p1ppqppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Black now takes control of the b-file and should have a fair game ahead of him. Unfortunately his queenside pawn structure is pretty weak while White's doubled pawns can easily be defended by the two bishops.
337,12,7,Ne8,b'1rb1nrk1/p1ppqppp/2p5/8/4PB2/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',11. ... d6 would have been better as White's two bishops will now encounter minimal resistance and Black will have a hard time bringing his rook on f8 into the game.
338,12,8,1Qh5,b'1rb1nrk1/p1ppqppp/2p5/7Q/4PB2/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White is planning to push the pawn on e4 forward and then checkmate Black by taking the pawn on h7 with the queen. Of course Black will have none of that.
339,12,9,1Qa5,b'1rb1nrk1/p1ppqp1p/2p3p1/Q7/4PB2/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White again mounts an attack against the pawn on c7 as well as the pawn on a7.

341,12,11,1a5,b'4nrk1/Q1p1qp1p/1rppb1p1/P7/4PB2/2PB4/2P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White knows that if he can build up enough pressure on Black's queenside Black will have to give up material to stop a promotion.
342,12,12,Ra2,b'4nrk1/Q1p1qp1p/2ppb1p1/P7/4P3/2PB4/r1P2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Black wants to trade off rooks and quite frankly it's a good idea. One less White rook means that Black can defend more easily against a promotion.
343,12,13,1Bh6,b'4nrk1/Q1p1qp1p/2pp2pB/P7/4P3/2PB4/b1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Black's rook is trapped and so there is only one good move.
344,12,14,1Ng7,b'5rk1/Q1p1qpnp/2pp2pB/P7/4P3/2PB4/b1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',This move has the added bonus of giving the rook some participation in the action. Unfortunately for Black White's queen is still dominating Black's queenside.

349,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game for me is intriguing because it demonstrates how to take a common opening the standard 4 knights and create a peculiar variation which becomes very different for the other player to anticipate.  
350,13,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Textbook.

At the level I play it I've seen this opening quite a few times because it has a simple objective for white that allows you to easily develop pieces. The goal is obviously put a knight on f7 and claim the rock. Black can play defense h6 or mirror it by Bf5. But this time I thought that perhaps of a different order would be fun to try.
352,13,3,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',From here white was in I suspect uncharted territory. He can easily gain material by grabbing the knight but d5 means he will lose that material advantage on the next move. According to gameknot's DB the other popular choices are Bf7 wherein the bishop is sac. to expose the black king or that white castles in order to put pressure on black's king. Both require a lot of knowledge about this opening which neither of use really had. 
353,13,4,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',White's position is now unstable. I suspect the correct choice is to preserve the knights to harass Black's queen.  
354,13,5,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White instead decides to save the bishop I pick up the knight. 
355,13,6,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p5/4p3/4p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',White decides to exchange his way out which might seem like a good idea but is in fact a mistake. White has thrown away all of his developed pieces and the knight has to retreat back to g1. Nxe5 seems to be a good idea but as we'll see results in disaster. 
356,13,7,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p5/4N3/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Seems like a good option right? White evens out material and puts pressure on c6 pawn. However underneath the tranquil surface of the board this move allows black to permanently seize the initiative.  
357,13,8,Qg5,b'r1b1kb1r/p1p2ppp/2p5/4N1q1/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',"From here the knight is lost. Maybe you can save it by d4 but c5 eliminates the defending pawn.. which is in turn defended with the black bishop. If anyone has played out that exchange I'd love to hear how it turned out. 

The real threat is Qxg2 the center pawn and the fact that both black bishops are free to attack. "
358,13,9,Nxc6,b'r1b1kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/6q1/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White perhaps hopes he can ride out the storm and pick up a pawn. However his king side is so woefully developed that he has no material to defend the coming onslaught. 
359,13,10,1Rf1,b'r1b1kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p3/8/PPPP1PqP/R1BQKR2 b Qkq -',White consolidates the position but it won't help. 
360,13,11,1Bg4,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/4p1b1/8/PPPP1PqP/R1BQKR2 w Qkq -',This move to me seems downright perfect. You could win the rock with Bh3 (or the queen eventually... Bh3 k2e Bg4)  but this is better because it incorporates the pawn. And because that pawn on e4 white's pawn on f2 is basically nothing more than cannon fodder. 
361,13,12,exf3,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/8/5p2/PPPP2qP/R1BQK3 w Qkq -',It's here where the pawn comes into it's own. By including the pawn instead of exchanging his way into a material deficit (black's queen can easily break off the attack to bag the knight) white no has his back against the wall without much room to maneuver. 
362,13,13,1d4,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/3P4/5p2/PPP3qP/R1BQK3 b Qkq d3',I think to avoid what happens next white has to sack the queen. The idea behind this move is alright to bring out the bishop and try to castle the king away from queen but it doesn't matter now. 
363,13,14,1f2+,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/3P4/8/PPP2pqP/R1BQK3 w Qkq -',There is no good option from this situation. 
364,13,15,f1=Q+,b'r3kb1r/p1p2ppp/2N5/8/3P4/8/PPPK2qP/R1BQ1q2 w kq -',"The king has to retreat forward meaning the white will lose his queen and face against black's two queens. Obviously the game was more or less over by this point. The only way out for white was guard the knight with pawn d4 or defend the g2 pawn from the queen which I suspect was the only move that could have forestalled with outcome. 

If I were to draw a moral from this story it would be how a minor deviation in a well used opening can transform a game and make something normally predictable into quite a puzzle for your opponent. Granted this probably does not work with players above 1800 but at my level it's surprisingly successful. 

Lastly I'd like to thank white for a good game.

Then he just takes the queenside pawns while I have to stop the kingside pawns. What other choices do I have? Put the king on e6 play f5 to trade pawns and trade my bishop for his queen on h8?

Normally after 2. d4 d5 we have what is called the French Defence an interesting opening with chances for both sides. However neither side seems to be using the Gameknot opening databases and the game soon takes on a unusual character.

477,17,26,3b3,b'4r3/1pp3k1/3p4/p2P1p2/P1P2P2/1P1P3R/3K4/8 b - -',now i have some plan but not sure it will work.
478,17,27,Kf6,b'4r3/1pp5/3p1k2/p2P1p2/P1P2P2/1P1P2R1/3K4/8 w - -',i needed him to lose some tempo first. this is done
479,17,28,Rh8,b'7r/1pp5/3p1k2/p2P1p2/P1P2P2/1PKP2R1/8/8 w - -',this is a bit strange. More constructive would have been to enter on the e-column on e2 or e1 maybe. But I guess he wanted to refuse me to enter on 8 line.
480,17,29,3d4,b'7r/1pp5/3p1k2/p2P1p2/P1PP1P2/1PK3R1/8/8 b - -',alea jacta est. There is no return ticket.

483,17,32,4c5,b'8/1pp5/3p1k2/p1PP1p2/P2PrP2/1PK2R2/8/8 b - -',this is a slight mistake: i had no clear plan to make my king pass. Maybe I should have given my d4 pawn by playing b4 axb then Kxb4 Rxd4 followed by Kb5...
484,17,33,4dxc5,b'8/1pp5/5k2/p1pP1p2/P2PrP2/1PK2R2/8/8 w - -',i thought he would not do that. 
485,17,34,4dxc5,b'8/1pp5/5k2/p1PP1p2/P3rP2/1PK2R2/8/8 b - -',here I realized he could have obtain the draw not too hardly
486,17,35,4Kd3,b'8/1pp1k3/8/p1PP1p2/P3rP2/1P1K1R2/8/8 b - -',the idea was to threat him with Re3 it worked.
487,17,36,4Rf2,b'8/1pp5/5k2/p1PP1p2/P3rP2/1P1K4/5R2/8 b - -',i was thinking about a continuation implying a lot of tempos and I was not sure how I could push him to force the passage -again.
488,17,37,4Re1,b'8/1pp5/5k2/p1PP1p2/P4P2/1P1K4/5R2/4r3 w - -',thanks: you gave me the line I needed. this moves clearly let me win.
489,17,38,4Kc4,b'8/1pp5/5k2/p1PP1p2/P1K2P2/1P6/5R2/4r3 b - -',this was one of the equation solved. But i have to recognize that I had no idea how to force it without the previous move.
490,17,39,4Re8,b'4r3/1pp5/5k2/p1PP1p2/P1K2P2/1P6/5R2/8 w - -',much too late. And what if he played Re4? I would have faced a new threat on b3. blablabla: I would have had to push my c and d pawns... but then the king blablabla...
491,17,40,4Kb5,b'4r3/1pp5/5k2/pKPP1p2/P4P2/1P6/5R2/8 b - -',well now this is it: this is the one move that wins the game.

494,17,43,4Ra6,b'8/1pp5/r4k2/pKPP1p2/P4P2/1P6/4R3/8 w - -',maybe thinking of Rb6 in case of c6
495,17,44,4Re3,b'8/1pp5/r4k2/pKPP1p2/P4P2/1P2R3/8/8 b - -',so planning c6 followed by Rb6+

551,18,51,e3,b'8/8/4p3/1p6/1Pr5/1K2p3/5k2/3R4 w - -',white resigns. I have been lucky and/or white has been too optimistic around move 22. I liked the game because it tought me a lot of things about the power of pawns and bishops.
552,19,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This first move is fine opening up line for the Bishop and Queen and staking a claim to the e5 and c5 squares.
553,19,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',and Black replies with the same another sound move.
554,19,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is quite playable although not as aggressive as c4.
555,19,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',another sound developing move by Black.
556,19,4,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',After putting the pawn on c3 this is now the best square for the White Queen's Knight.
557,19,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Although this is a sound developing move by Black it does somewhat block the Black c pawn. I would prefer g6 c5 or e6 here for Black.
558,19,6,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move does not fit well with White's second and third moves. If White wanted the pawn on c4 she should have put it there on her second move. It also leaves the White d pawn unprotected.
559,19,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pn4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Which Black duly takes.
560,19,8,Nb3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pn4/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm not convinced this is best move either. Instead of Nb3 I would play e3 attacking the Knight on d4. After the Knight moves White can play N(g1) to f3 and start to develop her King side pieces with a view to playing O-O and getting her King to safety.
561,19,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black retreats the Knight although NxN(b3) was a reasonable alternative.
562,19,10,c5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/8/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',At the irsk of repeating myself e3 was better.
563,19,11,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/8/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black now has quite a dominating centre with pawns on d5 and e5 controlling c4 d4 e4 and f4 squares. If I were Black I would be very happy with this position!
564,19,12,e3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/8/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White finally gets round to making a move to develop the King side!
565,19,13,f4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/5P2/1N2P3/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',It is the right idea to strike at the Black centre but this is a bit premature. It is better to develop some pieces first say Bb5 followed by Ne2 and O-O then play f4.
566,19,14,e4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/4pP2/1N2P3/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This advance weakens Black's proud centre! Black no longer controls d4 and if I were White I would be thinking in terms of Ng1-e2-d4 perhaps combined with Bb5 to put pressure on Black Knight on c6.
567,19,15,Qc2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/4pP2/1N2P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',White comes up with another plan playing the Nb3 to d4. However first the pawn on c5 needs protecting from the Black Bishop on e7.
568,19,16,Bf5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp1b2/4pP2/1N2P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Another sound developing move by Black.
569,19,17,1Nd4,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp1b2/3NpP2/4P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',I'm not so happy about this plan though as after the exchange of Knights on d4 the Black pawn on e5 is passed that is to say there are no pawns preventing it from marching forward and queening. Although in the middle game this would not be possible it would be a great asset to Black in and ending. Also White has to watch for Black playing e4-e3 and simultaneously attacking White's Queen on c2 with the Black Bishop on f5. I would say it would be better to play the Knight on g1 to e2 and then if Black exchanges Knights on d4 to recapture with a Knight.
570,19,18,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQ -',Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still the the centre closed and no open files to operate on White has still a reasonable position except being a pawn down.
571,19,19,1Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQB2PP/R3KBNR b KQ -',A sensible developing move.
572,19,20,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp4/3PpPb1/8/PPQB2PP/R3KBNR w KQ -',I'm not sure why Black played this.
573,19,21,1Be2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp4/3PpPb1/8/PPQBB1PP/R3K1NR b KQ -',White again makes a good developing move. If Black take on e2 she can recapture with the Knight.
574,19,22,1Bf5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQBB1PP/R3K1NR w KQ -',Black retreats which may have been the best move but now Black has wasted two moves.
575,19,23,1Nh3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/7N/PPQBB1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',White develops the Knight to the only square available. However Black could just take it and leave White's King side pawns isolated and weak. In compensation White would have the open g file against the Black King but I would prefer Black's chances.
576,19,24,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/7N/PPQBB1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black continues to develop but it is unclear whether or not the Rook is really better on e8 rather than f8. Exchanging on h3 and then playing Qd8-d7 looks better. How on earth would White save the pawn on h3 in that situation?
577,19,25,1O-O-O,b'r2qr1k1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/7N/PPQBB1PP/2KR3R b - -',White castles on the Queen side. A bold move and probably the correct decision although I feel Nf2 first was perhaps even stronger. After O-O-O White could then attack on the King side with h3 g4 etc.
578,19,26,1c6,b'r2qr1k1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/7N/PPQBB1PP/2KR3R w - -',Black wants to open up files on the Queen side to attack the White King. This is the right strategy. B6 can't be played immediately as white would then keep the Queen side closed by playing c5-c6 so Black prevents this.
579,19,27,1Qb3,b'r2qr1k1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/1Q5N/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',White needs to counter-attack on the King side. She sees this and starts to manoeuvre her Queen over and simultaneously protects the Knight on h3 to stop her King side pawns from becoming weak. It is the right idea but Nf2 followed by g4 would have been a better way of doing this.
580,19,28,1Qc7,b'r3r1k1/ppq1bppp/2p2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/1Q5N/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',I can't see much wrong with b6 immediately opening lines on the Queen side.
581,19,29,1Qg3,b'r3r1k1/ppq1bppp/2p2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/6QN/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',So off to the King side the White Queen goes. Nf2 and g4 first was still better.
582,19,30,1b6,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/1pp2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/6QN/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',Black starts to open up the Queen side.
583,19,31,1Qh4,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/1pp2n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP1Q/7N/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',White moves the queen round to a more threatening position and now g4 can be played next move if given a chance. If she plays N(h3)-g5 Black at the moment has h7 defended adequately.
584,19,32,1Bxh3,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/1pp2n2/2Pp4/3PpP1Q/7b/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',So Black exchanges so if g4 does come it doesn't threaten the Bishop on f5. As Black has all the pawns on the King side on the second rank i.e. f7 g7 and h7 it will be harder for White to open files on the King side than Black to open files on the Queen side. Still castling on opposite sides was probably the best strategy for White as she was a pawn down and would probably have lost if she had castled on the same side. Castling on opposite sides is a good way to randomise the position and increase the chances of a swindle!
585,19,33,1Qxh3,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/1pp2n2/2Pp4/3PpP2/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',So White recaptures.
586,19,34,1bxc5,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/3PpP2/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',And Black continues to open up the Queen side.
587,19,35,2dxc5,b'r3r1k1/p1q1bppp/2p2n2/2Pp4/4pP2/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',White recaptures.
588,19,36,2Bxc5,b'r3r1k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/2bp4/4pP2/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',And Black grabs a second pawn.
589,19,37,2f5,b'r3r1k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/2bp1P2/4p3/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',White advances with the f pawn. Advancing the King side pawns is the best strategy although I prefer g4.
590,19,38,2Reb8,b'rr4k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/2bp1P2/4p3/7Q/PP1BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',So Black starts to mobilise to use the open b file.
591,19,39,2b4,b'rr4k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/2bp1P2/1P2p3/7Q/P2BB1PP/2KR3R b - b3',Oh dear! White loses a pawn and opens up the position even more on the Queen side. One could hardly hope for a more co-operative opponent! When defending as White is doing on the Queen side as a general rule it is better to keep the pawns on the second rank i.e. in this position on a2 and b2 unless forced to advance them. I would prefer Bc3 in this position defending the b2 pawn and threatening taking the Black Knight on f6 in some variations.
592,19,40,2Bxb4,b'rr4k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/3p1P2/1b2p3/7Q/P2BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',So White goes 3 pawns down.
593,19,41,2Qg3,b'rr4k1/p1q2ppp/2p2n2/3p1P2/1b2p3/6Q1/P2BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',This is actually a fine move by White if followed up with Bh6 to threaten mate on g7. Black would be forced to play g6 and then there are chances of opening up the Black King side with pawn h2-h4-h5 and exchange on g6. Black still would have an advantage but White would have chances if Black wasted time.
594,19,42,2Qa5,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/q2p1P2/1b2p3/6Q1/P2BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',Black also mobilises the Queen against the White King. The a2 pawn is now a goner as if White tries to defend with say Kb1 Kb2 or Qb3 Black has B(b4)xd2. White's King is starting to look very bare. The position is basically lost for Black. B(d2)xB(b4) is probably the only way to prolong the game.
595,19,43,2Qe5,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/q2pQP2/1b2p3/8/P2BB1PP/2KR3R b - -',Is she trying to defend with the Queen along the long black diagonal? If so unfortunately Black finds a neat way to finish White off.
596,19,44,2Ba3+,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/q2pQP2/4p3/b7/P2BB1PP/2KR3R w - -',Good move well done Black!
597,19,45,2Kc2,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/q2pQP2/4p3/b7/P1KBB1PP/3R3R b - -',Forced unless White wants to give her Queen away for nothing with Qb2.
598,19,46,2Qa4+,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/3pQP2/q3p3/b7/P1KBB1PP/3R3R w - -',Another good move from Black!
599,19,47,2Kc3,b'rr4k1/p4ppp/2p2n2/3pQP2/q3p3/b1K5/P2BB1PP/3R3R b - -',"This time definitely forced! But now Bb2 is mate! So an interesting game. Both players at times wasted time. Both players seemed to understand that if you castle on opposite sides you must attack your opponent's King. Black won this game because he had an extra pawn or two going into the middle game he attacked more effectively and although White correctly tried to muster a King side attack also played the dreadfully weakening 22. b4?

686,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I think I will leave the title for you readers to try and suss out I can't and I need your help!  Anyhow this was my 50th game against the Master Mater and I hate to say it but I played loads better against him in my first game and that was when I had a Class C rating!  Here I made the mistake of using the analyse board feature but not analysing it far enough!  Anyhow on with the game where I kick off with e4."
687,22,1,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1. ..... h6 - Freddy just lurves these unusual openings!
688,22,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/1pppppp1/p6p/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - so far so sensible development.
689,22,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p3p2p/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. e5 - I try and cramp the Master Mater for style.....
690,22,4,c5,b'r1bqkb1r/3nnpp1/pp2p2p/2ppP3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq c6',8. ...... c5 - but it ain't gonna last cos Freddy now undermines my pawn structure.
691,22,5,1Bxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1pp1/ppn1p2p/3pP3/N2B4/5N2/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',11. Bxd4 - now Freddy has a knight on a decent square and in fact Freddy's two horsies are ganging up on that e5 pawn.
692,22,6,1Nb6,b'r1b1kb1r/2qn1pp1/pNn1p2p/1p1pP3/3B4/4QN2/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',13. Nb6??? - eeek eeek and treble eeek!  I will have knightmares about this for years to come.  Now the move looked OK at first.  I did spot 13...... Nxd4 and the family fork on c2 after I play 14. NxR but I thought that I could get away with it by moving Henry to d2 and if 15......NxQ 16.  NxQ+.  But I bally would have to overlook 15...... Bb4+ wouldn't I?  Doh and Double Doh!
693,22,7,Nxb6,b'r1b1kb1r/5pp1/pn2p2p/1p1pP3/8/5N2/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',15. ..... Nxb6 - voila now I am a whole piece to the bad against the Master Mater.  But I do take his advice this time and play on until I am facing further ruinous loss of material.  The rest is an exercise in how to polish off a player who is a piece down.
694,22,8,1Rhe1,b'r1b1kb1r/3n1pp1/p3p2p/1p1pP3/8/5N2/PPP1BPPP/2KRR3 b kq -',17. Rhe1 - I try and put my remaining army on the best squares possible but I am still mad at myself for falling for such a tactical shot!

I do prolong the game beyond 30 moves which is what Freddy is encouraging us U1900s to do.  Boy it is torture!
699,22,13,3fxe4,b'5rk1/6p1/2bbnr1p/3p4/pp2P3/6P1/PPPN3P/1K1BRR2 b - -',32. fxe4 - another set of pawns is exchanged but oh dear so are some pieces.

705,22,19,b3,b'8/6p1/5k1p/1bb5/p7/1p2p1P1/PPP4P/4KN2 w - -',42. ...... b3 - Freddy invites the exchange of another pair of pawns but the idea behind this will soon become apparent.
706,22,20,a3,b'8/6p1/5k1p/1b6/1b6/pPP1p1P1/1P5P/4KN2 w - -',44. ...... a3 - I can capture Freddy's dsb but I will not be able to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West making an appearance and carting off Henry to the Hospitality Quarters of her castle and subjecting him to goodness knows what every night ....  I decided to spare Henry those horrors and waved the white flag.  I am now playing my 51st game against him and I am hoping to fine tune Operation Joblock!
707,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',First off This game was a blitz chess game that I played at 4:00 in the morning If you didn't get that to start. It has some interesting moves. I will be annotating this from the first person so I can give thoughts and opinions on the matter lets get started shall we?
708,23,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The game begins with a battle for the center of the board.
709,23,2,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',The most common response to ...exd4 except for on GK apparently.
710,23,3,Qe3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',My opponent chooses the Paulsen attack A variation I haven't studied too much.
711,23,4,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',I respond with b6 the Jarvinen variation.
712,23,5,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/8/4P3/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',This move blocks both of our knight's mobility. Nc3 would have been a much stronger option developing a knight and giving extra coverage to the e4 pawn.
713,23,6,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4P3/2P1Q3/PP2BPPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',This move develops my bishop and allows the king to castle but more importantly attacks white's queen and applies pressure to f2.
714,23,7,Qf4,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4PQ2/2P5/PP2BPPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',In my opinion g3 or even g5 are stronger moves but neither option fits into my opponent's plan.
715,23,8,f3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4PQ2/2P2P2/PP2B1PP/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',White has a number of stronger moves but chooses to once again lock in his own knight.
716,23,9,g4,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4PQP1/2P2P2/PP2B2P/RNB1K1NR b KQ g3',This was the move that scared me white is fiercely marching his pawns at my kingside.
717,23,10,Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4PQP1/2P2P2/PP2B2P/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',This move allows me to put extra coverage on the e5 square and more importantly set up my own attack on white's king.
718,23,11,1h4,b'r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1pn2n2/2b5/4PQPP/2P2P2/PP2B3/RNB1K1NR b KQ h3',I expected g5 here my knight's only escape square is h5 once he does decide to push it up.
719,23,12,1Ne5,b'r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/2b1n3/4PQPP/2P2P2/PP2B3/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',This move may seem strange here but it'll come in handy later.
720,23,13,1h5,b'r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/2b1n2P/4PQP1/2P2P2/PP2B3/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',This move cuts off all escape for my knight plus this guy is all up in my grill. I once again expected g5 here.
721,23,14,1Qe7,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p3n2/2b1n2P/4PQP1/2P2P2/PP2B3/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',Now my plan is ready for action. if white had played g5 my attack would be much less devastating.
722,23,15,Nxf3+,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p3n2/2b3PP/4PQ2/2P2n2/PP2B3/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',my opponent did not expect this and because he's in check he has to do something about it.
723,23,16,1Nxf3,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p3n2/2b3PP/4PQ2/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K2R b KQ -',"Finally getting that piece developed! This is actually quite a mistake that will lose white some material or the game in the long run. Bb7 was slightly better but still problematic for white.

White could have played 13. Bxf3...Nxe4 Then he would have a few options If he chooses to take the knight then he's in some mega trouble 14. Bxe4...Bxe4 then he can either lose the rook and have mate once again threatened or 15. Rh2...Bd3+ 16. Kd2...Be3 and I win white's queen for my bishop stranding his king on a very unsafe d3.

after hypothetical 13. Bxf3...Nxe4 if white had played something like 14. Kf1 then ...Ng5 threatening mate with the queen on d1. 15. Bd2 and i get a free knight and because after 15. ...Nxf3 16. Nxf3...Qd2# ... This option results in a huge loss of material and position as well.

14. Kd1 is the white kings best option here although it still lands him down a pawn and in a precarious spot: 14.Kd4...Nf2+ 15. Kc2...Bxf3 16.Qxf3...Nh1 17. Qxh1...Bxg1 18. Qxg1...Qe4+ then 19. Kb3 is forced due to his other options being mate in 1 for me."
724,23,17,1Nxe4,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b3PP/4nQ2/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Escaping the clutches of the advancing pawn wall by tearing it down. Because my opponent spent all of his time with that pawn attack he could not get many pieces developed and now is in a tight spot although he has a one pawn material advantage.
725,23,18,1Rh4,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b3PP/4nQ1R/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K3 b Q -',White sees that his rook is in danger by way of the bishop on b7. Rh2 would have been a much better option.
726,23,19,1Nxg5,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b3nP/5Q1R/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K3 w Q -',Material is even and white is now in danger of checkmate in 1! I have a crushing position now
727,23,20,1Qe5,b'r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b1Q1nP/7R/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K3 b Q -',Trying to trade of his queens this blunder will cost white dearly.

And that's all folks I hope you've enjoyed my annotations and sloppy opening."
729,24,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A standard opening.
730,24,1,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I went for a Queens Raid Opening.

733,24,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',"Black has now blocked my access to the f7 square completely.*

734,24,5,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnbp1p/3p1np1/4p3/2BPP3/5Q2/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Black and White continue development.
735,24,6,Qh3,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbp1p/3p1np1/4p3/2BPP3/7Q/PPP1NPPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',I decided to get a Rook-Queen battery toward h7 after developing my rook.
736,24,7,1Rxf4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbp1p/3p2p1/8/2BPnR2/7Q/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 b - -',I thought attacking the pawn would nicely place my rook.
737,24,8,1Nef6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbp1p/3p1np1/8/2BP1R2/7Q/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 w - -',I feared Nh6 which would block my battery-to-be.
738,24,9,1Qh6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbp1p/3p1npQ/8/2BP1R2/8/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 b - -',So i went ahead and moved my queen.
739,24,10,1Bxf7,b'r1bq1r1k/pppnbB1p/3p1npQ/8/3P1R2/8/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 b - -',I did this to block off the king access to g8 but...
740,24,11,1Rxf7,b'r1bq3k/pppnbr1p/3p1npQ/8/3P1R2/8/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 w - -',... my move let his rook onto the 7th rank.
741,24,12,1Qh3,b'r1bq3k/pppnbr1p/3p1np1/8/3P1R2/7Q/PPP1N1PP/RNB3K1 b - -',I moved back for another try at a battery.

In this event I play 2nd Board for the midwestern ""Plains"" team under 1st BD Jim Davies (M) a strong Master from Missouri. My opponent Brad Jenison is a strong and well known player from ""Dixie""  who simply has a moment of inattention during the opening. I think we have probably all committed a similar mistake that has cost us a game or a narrow & harrowing escape if not. I can honestly say at this point on my way up to the Master title from here no one got any narrow escapes . . .

An opening where I cannot dismiss the feeling of receiving better than I deserve at times. Other examples being my Draw with CGM Ian Brooks while at APCT (which is online at some d-bases) and an exchange-sac Win at APCT also vs Expert player Hal Stone ... who was involved in the programming of one of the very first mainframe computers! In 2001 A Space Oddyssey; ""How about a nice game of Chess Dave?"" asks their spaceship's computer ""HAL"". Hmmm. Makes you wonder ... I guess I should have Asked about that~!

787,26,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I have sometimes wondered if it matters whether 2...Nf6 is played instead. That may be a bit more flexible leaving WT to wonder if BL will play ...e6 at all or go without it into Lenningrad Dutch lines where ...d6 & ...g6 may be played without it & perhaps save a tempo when/if ...e5 is played. Or BL might also play ...b6 & may transpose to Dory Defense lines with Bb7 & Ne4 against Nf3.
788,26,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"A most common Dutch Defense position. From here BL will have many options to select from. He might seek to play ...d5 and enter a Stonewall formation perhaps the best known form of Dutch. Also well known and very popular is a Leningrad formation where BL will fianchetto his Bg7. And yet another the Modern Dutch is typified by the move ...d6 being played and has two main themes. The first attempts to create and hold a strong point at e4 which he will likely occupy with the piece as well such as the Nf6 after fianchetto of the Bc8 to Bb7. This may easily be transpositional to or from the Dory Defense. [Also similar to positions from the ...b6 lines of the Nimzo-Indian advocated by R.J. Fischer tho the KB there is usually exchanged on c3 after playing Bb4 making that the major difference and perhaps the pawn structure if WT recaptures by bxc3 but if not then even that aspect is quite similar. I feel this holds advantage over the ...b6 and play of the Queens Indian and  perhaps RJF had a like preference since he did play and advocate the Nimzo line.] Finally a Modern Dutch with ...d6 may forsake the ...b6 finachetto and instead play to attempt enforcement of an ...e5 push as the basis of his play. Or may opt to keep the center reactive while trying to gather pieces for K-side attack. Tho one should expect a Center strike to occur in response to any wing attack initiated without center play being first resolved ... BL can hope to react to that in such way that the Center does resolve from being a fluid pawn situation into one that becomes closed or more likely becomes fixed while becoming only semi-open rather than fully open or remaining as a fluid instrument of attack for the WT player. Admittedly two very different approaches. However if one is familiar with the Bird's Opening it has been noted as being such that the WT side there with his Dutch-like position often CAN initiate and prosecute K-side attack effectively Without first resolving the center. And there BL often finds that a Q's wing attack is too slow in reply. And even his center strike that opens the d-file or plays ...d4 with a closed but restrictive center will be insufficient and ineffective against the WT player. This is a peculiarity common to Dutch type pawn formations which I do not know to exist in others. At least not from any openings that I have played & attained great familiarity with. I welcome you the readers to post any comments to the contrary if you believe you have seen another opening with such a feature commonly present.  }8-)

Well he knows that this will ease future  pressure on d5 and the difference in development does not reach significant difference (he hopes!) between the two players for a d4 opening ... where it is usually most important Where a piece can/does go than how quickly they come out. In no way is BL playing for the trap that the game goes into. Just to try for a more simplified unbook position and try for equality in a bit. Wt can react energetically here with d5 BL hopes will be only transpositional. Or he can play his Q to touch the Nc3 square. Or e3. Or as he does. All should be playable to various degrees .... which I never got to investigate fullly before retirement from Postal. It is likely there will be little to recommend the BL treatment unless he were willing to draw a game. [And might have to ""work"" for that if WT plays on stubbornly aka is a ""dixie"" player! But BL knows his success was always from working a bit harder and more hours than some. So nothing is new there.  This is what I must do not a ""natural"" Chess player ... and even then if you wish to master the game superior execution will take you only so far. You must know more at some point. So that you can present inferior options to an opponent give him difficult decisions that you know the answers to. Don't take this as a note to the game. Just some advice for those with Chess hunger. When you work hard and learn some ""luck"" follows.] Btw Bf4 here could get quite ""interesting"" and I'm no longer sure for whom. Maybe someone will let me know :)"

Here is a question for you? If black plays 3. ...C5!? and white replies with 4. Bb5+ what should be black's next move?"

Q.what is an attack?
A. An attack is the threat of winning material or checkmate. Most successful attacks begin with the simple plan of winning material i.e. a pawn. From there it builds to gaining control of open lines superior space winning minor pieces winning major pieces and then finally winning the king. The number one reason for failed attacks is over estimating or going for more than what is possible. For example the odds of you winning a rook(major piece) within the first 20 moves is very rare. So set the goal of winning a pawn as your first attacking objective. 

In this position I am threatening to win a pawn with ...Nxe5. So white is forced to defend the threat in order to keep the balance. "

1. it hinders the white knight by denying it.s natural developing sqaure
2. too many pawn moves white need to get his pieces out. Does he expect to win the game with just his pawns?

My kingside is completely undeveloped. So my goal as black is to attack e5 by undermining it with cxd4 and create some space to place my king side pieces.

This is a great place to talk about the KEY ELEMENTS of a successful attack.

1. Piece superiority in the area of attack
2. Space advantage in the area of attack
3. control of open lines in the area of attack
4. Harmonious communication between pieces in the general area of attack

In this case white plays the attacking move 9.b4. For him none of the key elements exist. However the situation is the exact opposite for black!

1. Black has piece superiority-3 pieces to white 1 that directly influence the c5 sqaure
2. Black clearly has a space advantage on the queen side
3. there is no open lines in the area so this is equal for both sides( this is the only thing that black does not have)
4. Black's pieces are in harmony- Black has 4 active pieces in the area of attack verses white's 1 piece.

This leads us to the next phase: How does one execute a successful attack. Here is the step by step process:
1. Create threats
2. Increase your space advantage by marshalling all or most of your pieces to attack squares that force your opponent to push pawns up to create weaknesses
3. Restrict the mobilty and influence of your opponents pieces
4. force through a breakthrough that usaully results in a mating attack on the king or massive lost of material.

1119,36,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',She doesn't play the same openings every time so it was no surprise that she deviated from Nf6 which she played and lost against me.
1120,36,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So I played the Queen's Gambit offering a temporary sacrifice of a pawn.
1121,36,3,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Which is Cambrudge-based Candidate Expert accepted. It is quite sound to accept it - what is normally bad for Black is to accept it and then try and hang on to the extra pawn.
1122,36,4,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I pick a sharp variation which scores well for white (40%)
1123,36,5,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And she picks the most-played variation. If I now take on e5 she can exchange queens on d1 and then play Be6 protecting her pawn on c4. I think that would be good for Black so I elect for another option.
1124,36,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the most played move and scores quite highly (39%)
1125,36,7,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2ppP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Again taking on d4 is by far the most popular option according to the Gameknot World opening database.
1126,36,8,Bxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2BpP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White recaptures one of his pawns. Again the most popular continuation.
1127,36,9,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black again continues with the most popular move but I was quite happy. In the database I was using White scores 41% compared to 22% for Black and 36% draws.
1128,36,10,Nbd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I continue with the tried and tested way.

Ng4 is normally played although White won both the games on the world database on the Gameknot database it is one win and one loss. So now I had a good think. Could I take advantage of the knight being on d7 rather than g4? 10. e6 fxe6 11. Bxe6 Nc5 wouldn't be so clever white is losing material. But there must be something based on e6. Hang on what if I play Bxf7 first?

1137,36,19,1Qxf7,b'r1b1k2r/pppn1qpp/2n5/4P3/1b1p4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black is forced to take.

Ideally Black would like to exchange queens to reduce White's attacking force. However Qg8 with the idea of exchanging on the b3-g8 diagonal doesn't work as white takes the knight on d7 with check and then after black has dealt with the check he can prevent the exchange of queens. Basically white has made the minor concession of giving up a bishop for a knight in an open position but in return has the balck king wandering round the centre of the board and there is the lovely open e file to use. Overall white has better prospects.
1139,36,21,1Qg6,b'r1b1k2r/pppn2pp/2n1P1q1/8/1b1p4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',So black moves her queen to a more active square than g8. From g6 she may be able to muster up some sort of king side attack with Bh3 threatening Qxg2 mate. I have to be careful.
1140,36,22,1exd7+,b'r1b1k2r/pppP2pp/2n3q1/8/1b1p4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',So I recapture my sacrificed material.

Qxb7 O-O 15. Qxc7 - in which case Black instead of having the disadvantage of having a king wandering round the centre of the board instead has the disadvantage of being a pawn down.

So the best solution seems to attack the bishop.
1145,36,27,1Bxd2,b'r2k3r/pppb2pp/2n3q1/8/3p4/PQ3N2/1P1b1PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Again black had a choice. Instead of giving up the good bishop for a relatively inactive knight she could have retreated the bishop - but at the cost of losing the b7 pawn to Qxb7. Black prefer to keep material equilibrium.
1146,36,28,1Bxd2,b'r2k3r/pppb2pp/2n3q1/8/3p4/PQ3N2/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I was quite happy with this position although the computer afterwards only gave me +0.45 here.
1147,36,29,1Kc8,b'r1k4r/pppb2pp/2n3q1/8/3p4/PQ3N2/1P1B1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black has to protect the b pawn but maybe it would have been better to play b6. In general the defending side should try and avoid pawn moves on the flank he or she is defending but here there are opposite coloured bishops and generally all other things being equal black needs to put pawns on black squares to enhance the scope of her bishop and limit the scope of white's.  Also maybe black could put her king on b7 and allow her Ra8 to develop along the back rank.
1148,36,30,1Bf4,b'r1k4r/pppb2pp/2n3q1/8/3p1B2/PQ3N2/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',So white continues to develop. Black is going to find it hard to develop the Ra8 to any meaningful square. If she could exchange the positions of her king and Ra8 she would have a fine position.
1149,36,31,1Rf8,b'r1k2r2/pppb2pp/2n3q1/8/3p1B2/PQ3N2/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Developing with gain of time. However I wonder if maybe Re8 was better not allowing white uncontested control of the e file and in some variations exchanging one of the powerful white rooks.

1151,36,33,1Nxe5,b'r1k2r2/pppb2pp/6q1/4n3/3p1B2/PQ6/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',So black exchanges knights.

1155,36,37,1d3,b'r1k2r2/ppp3pp/2b3q1/8/8/PQ1p2B1/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black hope to get play with her one big asset her passed d pawn. Although the computer doesn't critiize this move I can't help thinking Re8 was better rather than to allow white uncontested control of the e file.

Bxf8 Qxf8 27. Rxd1 although I can't really see why white has to retreat the rook on move 20 rather than just take the pawn on c7 or play something like Ra-e1. I think there are other improvements too and white doesn't seem to have much advantage at the end of this line!
With the game continuation black bishop looks a bit silly moving back and forward between c6 and d7.

1198,38,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',This is the first move of the Dutch Defence a bold defense for Black.
1199,38,1,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is known as the Staunton Gambit a pawn sacrifice used by Howard Staunton on a regular basis.
1200,38,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/6B1/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',4. ... Nc6 is more common these days. White can now win back the pawn.
1201,38,3,b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p1pp2pp/1p2pb2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',This is a fairly balanced position even if Black's kingside is lacking in defenders. Note that White's two knights and bishop are geared towards the general direction of the Black king.
1202,38,4,Ne5,b'rnbq1rk1/p1pp2pp/1p2pb2/4N3/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Not the best move. Black can simply play 9. ... Bxe5 to get rid of the attacking knight. After 10. dxe5 Nc6 White can play 11. Qh5 but Black then has 11. ... Rf5 and is reasonably safe.
1203,38,5,Qe7,b'rn3rk1/pbppq1pp/1p2pb2/4N2Q/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',This was the opportunity for Black to stay in the game. 10. ... Bxe5 would have been better and if 11. Ng5 then 11. ... h6 and Black has a good game ahead of him. It must be noted that while for some most likely those who haven't seen this game before a checkmate anytime soon doesn't seem to exist unless Black really messes things up. White has a variety of responses. 11. Nxf6+ is good but Black can reply 11. ... gxf6. 11. Ng5 receives the response of 11. ... g6 and 11. Nd6 is followed by 11. ... g6 12. Nxg6 Qxd6 13. Nxf8 Kxf8 which is fine for Black. But Lasker found another much better move.
1204,38,6,1Qxh7+,b'rn3rk1/pbppq1pQ/1p2pb2/4N3/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',As Saunders comments 'In calculating all the candidate moves by the minor pieces it was easy for Black to overlook this more drastic blow. Which of us in his shoes would have expected White to unleash such a fiendish sacrifice?'
1205,38,7,1Nxf6+,b'rn3r2/pbppq1pk/1p2pN2/4N3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Black can't capture the knight as his king is checked by the bishop as well. He could play 12. ... Kh8 but then White plays 13. Ng6#. Black has only one other option.
1206,38,8,Kf4,b'rn3r2/pbppq1p1/1p2pN2/8/3P1kNP/3B4/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQ -',Black's king is being forced away from his territory and into White's own.
1207,38,9,1Be2+,b'rn3r2/pbppq1p1/1p2pN2/8/3P2NP/5kP1/PPP1BP2/R3K2R b KQ -',This isn't the quickest way to checkmate Black as both 16. O-O and 16. Kf1 set up an unstoppable mate on the next move with 17. Nh2#. However Lasker's path to victory is much more pleasing to the eye.
1208,38,10,1Kd2#,b'rn3r2/pbppq1p1/1p2pN2/8/3P2NP/6P1/PPPKBP1R/R5k1 b - -',A strange choice of move by Lasker as 18. O-O would have been so much more beautiful and dramatic. However his queen sacrifice earlier in the game and the subsequent moves are no less impressive. According to Lasker himself Thomas was very gracious in defeat and to be honest that's the name of the game. To appreciate that it is only a game however magnificent it is.
