0,0,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',This is not a conventional opening.  It's understandable if this were a KG where you started with 1.e4 e5 2.f4  But otherwise it's like the Damiano's Defense.  So you don't want to advance the f pawn so early.  That's because as I learned with TA's blitz Q sac that I used to teach a student when he opened with that defense the f file is considered the weakest square on the chess board.  If it's moved early in the game one could win up in trouble.  Better was 1.e4 1.c4 or 1.d4 which are most analyzed by GM's.
1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My guess is that Sue is playing as though it were the Siclian Defense since she knows the line.  The idea is playing what you're comfortable and I understand that quite well.  When it wasn't the French but rather I believe the Ruy Lopez I kicked the N.  Well that's because I listened to the lecture by GM Susan Polgar on the Terrasch Variation and with the Ruy Lopez I could apply it as such.  In fact archduke_piccolo says that it works quite well but you have to be aware that some moves in one opening won't work in another.  But it does here.
2,0,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Getting a nice pawn chain in the process and opening up a line for for his LSB.  However I prefer black's position.
3,0,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Therefore Sue gets right to it by developing.
4,0,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/5P2/3BP3/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',So does John.
5,0,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/5P2/3BP3/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Opening up a line for his LSB.  Normally I'd take back what I said but his white's next move is about to change.
6,0,6,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/5P2/3BP2P/PPPP2P1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',?! That's because of continuing with development John advances his wing pawn.
7,0,7,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/5P2/3BP2P/PPPP2P1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',?! So Sue prepares to punish John for that.  The only problem with that is that black will be left with two bad bishops.  The idea being that both will be blocked by her pawns.  It's premature to say that both will stay like that but what we know is that one will remain for a while.  It's not too early to conclude that since charleshiggie said something in his most recent annotation.
8,0,8,g4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/5PP1/3BP2P/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR b KQkq g3',?! The idea is to gain tempo by kicking Sue's Nf6.  However the time could have been used to develop his Ng1 and prepare to castle.
9,0,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/5PP1/3BP2P/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',However Sue uses that tempo to develop another piece.
10,0,10,g5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p3P1/5P2/3BP2P/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',?! This was the plan behind 5.g4 but now with what I noted it's safe to say that it was pointless.  Normally I don't jump to that conclusion except that black can and will protect.  So the threat was in my books a waste of time since black is already better developed then white.
11,0,11,Nd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2npp3/2p3P1/5P2/3BP2P/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',! Best believe it or not.  I looked at 6...Nd5 but white would reattack with 7.e4 and after something like 7...Nb4 the N would be forced to the rim where it would not be worth as much.  And later on an exchange might ensue and in this position Sue's Knight's are more dangerous then her bishops since they're better placed making this a closed position as of the moment.
12,0,12,h4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2npp3/2p3P1/5P1P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',John is still pushing pawns as opposed to continue with development.  As kenneth_fiore 3 has put it this is asking for trouble.
13,0,13,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2np4/2p1p1P1/5P1P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Especially with this move because if John were to exchange Sue would be more then happy as she can recapture with her Nd7.  Not only would this leave her with a good bishop but it would be potentially dangerous whereas white has only one piece developed.
14,0,14,f5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2np4/2p1pPP1/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',John advances.  But in this position I would've exchanged on e5.
15,0,15,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n5/2pppPP1/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Strengthening her Bf8 as now Sue will be able to develop her DSB without it being cramped.  I once lost a game by leaving my Bishop crammed and having it confined to either e7 or d7 as black.
16,0,16,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n3P1/2pppP2/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Continuing to push pawns as opposed to following the guidelines.
17,0,17,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2nb2P1/2pppP2/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',It's understandable that Sue wants to develop.  I used to do the same thing and then took a while to realize that there are exceptions to guidelines.  This is one of them so best was 9...hxg6 winning a pawn whilst capturing towards the center.  That's because if John responds with 10.fxg5 black can answer with 10...Rxh4 and with the Queen white does not get anything if he plays 11.Rxh4.
18,0,18,1Qh5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2nb2P1/2pppP1Q/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Bringing the Q out before continuing with his development.
19,0,19,1Nb6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/1nnb2P1/2pppP1Q/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',?? Bringing the Knight to a better outpost.  But best was 10...Nf6 Sue.  Not only is this better placed but at the same time John would have to suffer the consequences of bringing his Queen out too soon.  The idea being is the gain of time since it's attacked which would force him to protect.  And when he does you'd be able to use that time to get your monarch to safety with 11...0-0  After which you're fine.  But by playing this your opportunity to castle is gone.  And your weakest pawn is gone which will leave your monarch exposed.  Therefore he now has the initiative.
20,0,20,1f6+,b'r1bq3r/pp2kPpp/1nnb1P2/2ppp2Q/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',Dishing in another check.
21,0,21,1Kxf6,b'r1bq3r/pp3Ppp/1nnb1k2/2ppp2Q/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',Which appears to be a nuicanse but remember that your weakest pawn is removed Sue.  That as id=tactical-abyss emphasizes in his Q sacs are very important.  John has some dangerous threats now.
22,0,22,1Nf3,b'r1bq3r/pp3Ppp/1nnb1k2/2ppp2Q/7P/3BPN2/PPPP4/RNB1K2R b KQ -',It starts with this move as now John's Queen Nf3 and Rh1 are all a danger.  In other words he's mobilizing his Q side to do some serious damage.
23,0,23,1Be6,b'r2q3r/pp3Ppp/1nnbbk2/2ppp2Q/7P/3BPN2/PPPP4/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Threatening his f7 pawn.  But John could play something that I think would end the game at once.  Can you see this Sue?
24,0,24,1Qg5+,b'r2q3r/pp3Ppp/1nnbbk2/2ppp1Q1/7P/3BPN2/PPPP4/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Best was 14.Ng5 with a forced mating sequence believe it or not.  The idea being is that the King would have to get out but it's pinned.  Therefore what would come after is 15.Rf1+ Bf5 (forced) 16.Rxf5#  Or 14.Ng5 Bf5 but after 15.Rf1! there is no way because the LSB is pinned.  And when white takes it would still be mate.  But by playing this black has some play left.  
25,0,25,1Qh5+,b'r2q3r/pp3kpp/1nnbb3/2ppp2Q/7P/3BPN2/PPPP4/RNB1K2R b KQ -',So he plays this.
26,0,26,1Kg8,b'r2q2kr/pp4pp/1nnbb3/2ppp2Q/7P/3BPN2/PPPP4/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Better was 15...g6 Sue as now John is forced to protect his Queen.  Either by exchanging with 16.Qg5 or 16.Qh6 which brings it out of play.  However the danger would not be as bad as what we're about to see.
27,0,27,Qe7,b'r5kr/pp2q1pp/1nnbb3/2ppp1NQ/7P/3BP3/PPPP4/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? This is how Sue responds but it is a super blunder because of John's next move which should win quickly.
28,0,28,1Nxh7,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nnbb3/2ppp2Q/7P/4P3/PPPP4/RNB1K2R b KQ -',But he missed it.  Best was to capture the other way with 18.Qxh7+ as now Sue would be forced to lose her LSB and remaining Rook to avoid mate.  It would continue with 18...Kf8 (forced) 19.Qh8+ Bg8 (forced which leaves it pinned) 20.Rf1+ Ke8 (also forced) 21.Qxg8+ Kd7 22.Rxa8  There was only one other option after 21.Qxg8+ but no good would be 21...Qf8 as now not only would Sue lose her Q for a R but John would mate with 22.Rxf8+ Bxf8 23.Qf7+ Kd8 24.Ne6+ Kc8 25.Qc7#
29,0,29,1d4,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nnbb3/2p1p2Q/3p3P/4P3/PPPP4/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The idea is to exchange pawns.
30,0,30,1Rg1,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nnbb3/2p1p2Q/3p3P/4P3/PPPP4/RNB1K1R1 b Q -',But John does not switch yet as he has something better.  So things are still dangerous for Sue.  
31,0,31,Bd5,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nnb4/2pbp2Q/7P/4P3/PPP5/RNB1K1R1 w Q -',Unlike before I don't know why Sue played this.
32,0,32,2Nc3,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nnb4/2pbp2Q/7P/2N1P3/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',But John attacks it whilst developing another piece at last.
33,0,33,2Nb4,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1n1b4/2pbp2Q/1n5P/2N1P3/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',Threatening a dangerous fork which John needs to be aware of.  Otherwise he could lose his advantage.
34,0,34,2e4,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1n1b4/2pbp2Q/1n2P2P/2N5/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',?? With that being said this is a blunder.  It's understandable that John wanted Sue's Bd5 out of there.  But better was 22.Kd2 but he'd still lose his right to castle.  Therefore best was 22.Qd1 preventing that without weakening the K side.  With that being said in this position how should black proceed Sue?
35,0,35,2Bc6,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nbb4/2p1p2Q/1n2P2P/2N5/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',?? Protecting the Bishop but best was 22...Nxc2+ and after John gets out of check black has 23...Nxa1 and even if then 24.exd5 after Sue takes back with her Nb4 or Nb6 she still winds up ahead.  By failing to play this as much as I hate to say it but black is lost with best play.
36,0,36,2Nd5,b'r5k1/pp2q1pN/1nbb4/2pNp2Q/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',Going after the Queen.
37,0,37,2Qe6,b'r5k1/pp4pN/1nbbq3/2pNp2Q/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',And Sue makes the right choice by retreating.  I know that she likely considered exchanging.  But my student remembered what I recently which is that when behind the one thing you don't want to do is exchange pieces.  That's known as liquidation which benefits the one that's ahead.  However John's next move will be almost overwhelming.
38,0,38,2Ng5,b'r5k1/pp4p1/1nbbq3/2pNp1NQ/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',Not only attacking the Queen but threatening a dangerous check.
39,0,39,2Qe8,b'r3q1k1/pp4p1/1nbb4/2pNp1NQ/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',?? This however is the losing blunder Sue.  It protects the Queen but your only option was 24...Qh6 in this position.  As much as I don't like exchanging when behind liquidation of Queen's is more or less forced to prevent what's bound to come.  That's because his Queen is even more dangerous which is also important to keep in mind.  
40,0,40,Kf8,b'r3qk2/pp4pQ/1nbb4/2pNp1N1/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',Forced.
41,0,41,Qf7,b'r4k2/pp3qpQ/1nbb4/2pNp1N1/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1KR2 w Q -',Also forced since both of John's Knights prevents Sue from getting out with her monarch since it can't move.  Therefore he is going to win her Queen for a Knight.
42,0,42,2Nxf7,b'r4k2/pp3NpQ/1nbb4/2pNp3/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1KR2 b Q -',But he missed an immediate mate.  With that being said best was 27.Qh8#
43,0,43,2Ke8,b'r3k3/pp3NpQ/1nbb4/2pNp3/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1KR2 w Q -',Preventing the immediate 27...Nxd6#.  But John however has an inevitable mating sequence anyhow.
44,0,44,3Rf6#,b'r7/pp4Q1/1nbk1R2/2pNp3/1n2P2P/8/PPP5/R1B1K3 b Q -',The overall morals to this story is that it's important to be aware of all threats made by your opponent.  That's important because she started with an advantage early on but lost it by allowing white to take away her weakest pawn.  This also applies to John because he overlooked a Knight fork by playing 22.e4?? That fork would've lost a P+R for a bishop which would've given Sue back her advantage.  But the other lesson is even though you generally don't want to liquidate pieces when behind there are times where this is a must.  So to figure this out it's important to evaluate what piece is more dangerous.  With that being said had Sue allowed an exchange with 24...Qe8 she might have gotten counterplay.  Even if not she would've lasted longer.  @knightrider62: This is also important to keep in mind in case you wind up with a similar situation in the future.  The idea being is that it's essential to access the positions carefully.  If you can remember this and the other lesson you will make further improvements faster then you might realize.

In the past it was always 1.e4 as you typically see with me but I wanted to try something different.  What I really have in mind is the Colle's System since I did well against Bert in our WTW game.  However I'm not sure how the computer will respond.
54,2,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Once they play this however I go into the Colle System.

62,2,9,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbpq2/3p4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Well in general it's not a good idea to block the c file in QPO.  But with stronger players you figure out why and what makes them play things different.  What are their plans.  At first this appeared to be a waste of time so I quickly thought about it and realized that he might have a threat.  
63,2,10,1e4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbpq2/3p4/3PP3/1P1B1N2/PBPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Therefore what concerned me was the possibility of 10...Nb4 followed by 11...c5 as after exchanging pawns it seemed that black might have a nasty threat.  What I figured would happen in the long term is that the opponent would figure out how to take my N off of f3 and then bring the Queen to the h file.  That would be proceeded with that pawn exchange and sooner or later having h2 become a target which might become difficult to drive off a threat.  Now the idea was trying to think at least 10 moves in advance with possible variations affiliated with them.  So I played this to prevent that chance.  When that happens I also keep this exchange in mind and know that what I'm picturing won't become a reality.
64,2,11,Bd7,b'r4rk1/pppb1ppp/2nbpq2/8/3PB3/1P3N2/PBPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Completing their development whilst connecting both Rooks.
65,2,12,1d5,b'r4rk1/pppb1ppp/2nbpq2/3P4/4B3/1P3N2/PBPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',? The idea here is to exchange pawns and pieces with this discovered attack against the Queen.  I analyzed the next few moves but made one oversight in my analysis as now I wind up a pawn down.  I'm not sure what the best move was but just about anything was better then this.
66,2,13,1Ng5,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2bbp3/6N1/4B3/1P6/PqPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I wasn't trying to win anything as it might appear.  If that were so it'd be too easy but the idea is just making it difficult so that the computer really has to think.  What came to mind was 14...g6 after which I'd kick the Queen.  But this is the cornerstone of where I stop calculating through the variations which is starting to take it's toll.  So it begins with them exchanging bishops.  By the looks of it it's almost even but we're far from that as black has won my much stronger bishop for his weaker one.  It reminds of that sodium attack from tactical-abyss in which he won.   That's because I'm slowly winding up in a lot of trouble.  Better was to retreat my Be4.  However I think that best was 14.Rfb1 and after retreating the Queen I'd gain tempo after 15.Be4 since black would've been under siege.
67,2,14,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bp3/8/4N3/1P6/PqPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',At first I thought that this was pointless.  But once black played I found out otherwise.  They're preparing a nasty discovered attack on my Queen which will turn out to be devastating.
68,2,15,1Rfb1,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bp3/8/4N3/1P6/PqPQ1PPP/RR4K1 b - -',?? Overlooking that and still viewing 15.Rad8! as pointless I played this in an attempt to gain tempo.  This is also where I completely stopped playing through variations.  In doing so I overlooked a ton of moves.  In fact knowing just how much trouble I'm in becomes a reality now as opposed to later starting with their next move.

I was pretty confident though that ""To take is a mistake"" due to studying similar positions.  But in this case I thought that I did not have a good move left.  In other words I felt that there was nothing better or anything else to lose.  If for example I had played 17.Kf1 (which was my second instinct) black would play 17...Rxd2.  So the inference is that I'd lose my Queen one way or another.  This kind of thing happens without analyze the board (which is why Wizard Chess is good practice as that doesn't exist.)  But had white been more careful and played through a little more I would've seen 18.Nxd2.  Despite losing the Queen I'd get a Rook as compensation.  At which point resignation would not be an option yet.  But by taking as opposed to calculating that Queen is free as we're about to see."

If 18.Kh3 or 18.Kh1 black play 18...Rxd2.  However I overlooked the Knight until the move was played.  What first came to mind was 18...Qxe4 and then 19...Rxd2.  However my Queen could still get out.  But their next move did not come into calculation after which I'm doomed.  I figured that he'd get the Queen for free. 
71,2,18,1Qh5+,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/7q/4NP2/1P6/P1PQ2PK/RR6 w - -',Which is why I resigned by pressing escape button.  However I still could've gotten the Rook.  However this is where I realized that there was nothing else to learn.  Just like with my game against reversion when there was nothing else to learn I also threw in the flag.  But the moral of this story is to calculate through all variations carefully.  Failing to do so for even one or two moves can lead to disaster as we saw here.

However despite not being in check which I initially thought I would've been able to recompensate with 9...Bxg5.  I felt that Sue would be able to liquidate with 10.Qxg5?? but this time overlooked that my Queen on d1 prevents that.  So best in reality was in fact 8...Nxe4.

By noticeable I mean extreme.  If it's just minor and something gets said I worry that they'll feel overwhelmed which would affect their play.  That's something that I don't want the idea is not making them feel uncomfortable which the worry is that it would happen.

Had Sue played Re1 right away the center would be blocked by her Bishop which I believe is an interference by definition.  By doing this they're better communicated.  The problem here however is that it'll leave her with doubled pawns near the K.  Now that we're in the midgame as per what tactical-abyss has outlined in similar games we don't want that.
114,4,13,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/1p1nqppp/p1np4/3Np3/4P3/1b3B2/PPPQ1PPP/1K1R3R b - -',?? Now this is noticeable.  So I said believe it or not this is the best you've played against me so far. However this is your first blunder in the game. Much better was to take back with the a or c pawns. I know that you were worried about exposing the King but this is better then the loss of a piece.  After this game however I learned something Sue.  So your best move was 14.axb3.  Another guideline says that you should capture towards the center as opposed to away from it.

I gave her Homework by showing her the position right after 22...Rfe8 to see if she could find the best.  Unfortunately she did not find the solution this time around.  Sue: Cannot see where I blundered Or loss in material.? Could have moved 1. Rd4 2. R xe4 3. Q x e4 maybe?  Joe: 23.Rd4 was possible but would still result in the same move that I'm bound to play. Best was 23.Qb6 hitting my b7 pawn in the process.

Joe: It is a common weakness but it's important to do so. The idea is to consider all threats made by your opponent. Knowing this will also help you to improve. So always take a moment and ask yourself what works or doesn't work first. Yes Qb4 was better because this move allows black to liquidate first. One thing you don't want to do is exchange when behind.  But what I forgot to explain is that in the process her K is going to be exposed with this exchange.  After which I will then exchange her Rh1 for my Ng3.

But when we exchange I'll have the other Rook on the second rank which will make it extremely dangerous and very difficult to defend against.  In fact this is a resignable position but I'm glad that Sue decided to play this out into the end.  By doing so I think that she's learning more.  As I tell my students you shouldn't resign or as GM Judit Polgar puts it ""Fight Til the End."""
134,4,33,h6,b'6k1/1R3pp1/p2p3p/3P3P/8/5p2/P1r1rP2/1K6 w - -',In this event she was threatening a back rank mate which I was well aware of in event.  I had considered 30...g6 but did not want to exchange on that square.  It was possible but I wanted to prevent the slightest risk of counterplay.  Come to think of it this was also possible because there still isn't a chance.  But the idea is keeping it simple as opposed to going into complications which I learned when bhidragon had that mating sequence against me and thus found the quickest win.
135,4,34,3Rb8+,b'1R4k1/5pp1/p2p3p/3P3P/8/5p2/P1r1rP2/1K6 b - -',As anticipated Sue puts me in check.  I was prepared by knowing that my next move is directly forced.  In doing so I'm even more comfortable.  So the other idea behind not playing 30...g6 and exchanging is staying in your comfort zone.
136,4,35,3Rb6,b'8/5ppk/pR1p3p/3P3P/8/5p2/P1r1rP2/1K6 b - -',I also anticipated this but have an answer when she decides to take.

So that if she find the move I would play 35...Rg2 and after 36.Rb1 36...f2 and I'd allow 38.Rxf1 after 37...f1=Q because it's mate wtih 38...Rxa2#  Even if she didn't take I'd still mate with the same move.
141,4,40,3Kb1,b'8/1R3ppk/p2p3p/3P3P/8/5p2/P2r3r/1K6 b - -',?? But this is how Sue responded.  So I said But this however loses right away. The Rook stayed on the b file which is where it needed to be. But the monarch should've remained a1. However there was pretty much no good moves left. Sooner or later I would've promoted my f pawn which would be mate. But this would've taken me longer. By moving the monarch over your Rb7 cannot prevent me from mating you. Anyway the moral is that when you can take back. Think before making a move and what the consequences will be as you note. And remember that two Rooks near the homesquare so on the seventh rank (for black) or second rank (for white) are very dangerous. The idea being is that the monarch is stuck on the homesquare so you must be careful. Once your Rook is blocked from the first rank it's mate.
142,4,41,3Rd1#,b'8/1R3ppk/p2p3p/3P3P/8/5p2/P6r/1K1r4 w - -',"After this game we discussed it.  Of course I reversed the colors and inadvertently said seventh as opposed to the second rank.  But it's still the moral of the story with both rooks.  Joe: This was your best game against me so far. You played very well until overlooking that you could've recaptured. But after that mistake everything was fine until allowing me to liquidate Queens and losing a Rook for Knight. After that I had both my Rooks on the seventh rank which is known to be deadly because your monarch was confined to the back rank. After that you moved your King on the same file that your Rook was on which is why mate couldn't be stopped. So another thing to learn is that one rook on the seventh rank is bad enough but two rooks are very deadly. Even with making the right choice like let's say that Rook moved down but on the same file black would've mated with the passed pawn. But overall there's always more to learn.  Sue: I kept my rook on the same file hope I could stop a mate on the seventh rank but as you say my biggest blunder was allowing the exchange of queens when I was already down in material. This was purely accidental as I meant to move it to a different square. Must always look before pressing submit""...  @knightrider62: I agree with that.  It's important to look at and access everything before making a move.  Remembering that is going to help you improve."

155,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I wasn't sure how the computer would respond since as noted it's different with black (especially on this level.)  But they decided to play KPO which I'm used to.
156,6,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I respond with my favorite defense.
157,6,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is obviously the open variation.
158,6,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I continue with the usual.
159,6,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But then the computer does something that I'm not used to.  I expected 3.d4 with the mainlines (3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6)  However it's also good practice to get used to something that you haven't seen.  It all blends in with theory.

But that inhibits my develop since I'm left with a cramped position.  The idea being is that now I'd be forced to lose tempo to get my LSB into play.  And since I'm not used to this and we're talking about difficult stuff ""Know your Principles"" absolutely applies.  So I'm not willing to deviate unless I must.  The only downside is that white will exchange my B for N.  And like what we saw with TA's Sodium Attack this is an open position which is going to make my position a little more difficult thereforth."

But as noted ""Know your Principles""  With that being said this move was decided.  The reason is that I'm developing another piece.  With 5...Ndf6 that doesn't happen and to add fire to the flames I'd be moving the same piece twice which one should not do especially against stronger players."

The idea being is that I felt my DSB would limited and rather tight on e7 (since that's the only square which is why I didn't push e7.)  However this appears to be a slight inaccuracy as well because like another game with a similar position I don't think there was time for this fianchetto.  It always boils down when there's enough time to do that which I have a difficult time knowing.

The idea being is that a Queen exchange can change the outcome of a game and that mentor (about 3 years ago) made me do Homework on how and why that happens.  My inference is that it applies here.

Best was to take immediately with 12...Qxb5 and after 13.Nxb5 I can defend with 13...d5  Of course I did not realize this mistake until the costly one later on.  That's why the thing to learn is knowing the pattern which is currently my weakness.  In fact this is how I wound up losing material against reversion early on.

176,6,21,dxe5,b'r1n1k2r/pp3pbp/5np1/1N2p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w kq -',"?? This is the losing blunder.  For me it's hard to know exactly when ""To take is a mistake""  Although I got it right in one of reversion's game it's often very difficult for me to tell.  The reason being is that Jack Stockel has actually made blunders before.  But it's rare.  The only time I knew of taking to be a blunder is with an immeidate checkmate.  However we've boiled down into the same category as what I saw with the same coach and dynamic_dv where after taking I've lost my Queen.  Well with a similar motive white will win my Rook without compensation.  It's ironic because I thought that white made the mistake by taking my pawn with 13.Nxe5 but it's the other way around.  This whole thing has to do with pattern recognition and something that bhidragon told me after making the mistake of cutting the c file off by playing ...c4.  In other words he said ""you absolutely must move beyond assessing individual moves in a vacuum without considering how they affect the entire position on the board.""  The problem is that is that despite my best efforts it hasn't happened yet.  And I made that same mistake here which boils down to pattern recognition which is also why choosing the most difficult level is good practice.  Better was 14...Rb8 (at once)  But best was 14...0-0 (getting my monarch to safety) and after 15.Nc7 15...Rb8 is still an option.  "

But since my intention is to post this in the WTWLTR annotation thread resignation isn't an option yet.  The idea being is that we follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules which states that you don't resign until mate can be proven.  Knowing that I'm lost but doing whatever to stay in I take a pawn.  But this is the final blunder as I overlooked the mating net that's bound to come.  I'm not sure what the best move was but my Knight had to remain on f6.  That way I would've been able to get out of check.  Despite being behind there would've been some fight left.

The reason this resumed is that lately there has not been an OTB WTW Chess Game with Jack because of Nemi (who's the newbie that's learning the game.)  And that's combined with the fact that the place that runs it as noted last time is closed due to the holidays.  Not only that but to make a long story times are getting busy for a lot of new games here which means that I'm not posting in ""Are All The Walkers Sitting"" yet.  That thread is for people who are looking for WTW challenges but the problem is time management.  On the other hand this substitutes for that as it helps me with my weaknesses especially the important stuff which why I'm also learning how to run.  Therefore although losing some time on the website it's worth it to improve even more.  And anygames like this will result in an annotation as we're seeing now which will also be posted in the WTWLTR Annotations Thread since that fits in with the description."

As noted black must be careful from here on in because removing the weakest pawn also means having an exposed King which is something to be weary of.  And this is where I start finding it to be instructive.

Normally it's a good to exchange while ahead.  However I deem this to be an exception since Joe is a much stronger player.  In fact he's stronger then anyone that I've played against and he knows how to counter this.  Knowing something of that accord and extent will often put the opponent in worse shape in the aftermath.  In addition this exchange is not only going to cost Dan a pawn but in return Joe will have a passed pawn which is known to be very dangerous.

But this is white's first blunder as reversion will win a piece for a pawn.  So that when all is said and done he'll be the equivalent to a piece down.  This is a time where one had to deviate from the General Opening Guidelines so best was to retreat his Nf3.
240,11,8,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/8/3p4/2BPPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq d6',Now it's reversions turn to open up the center and get his Bc8 ready to come out.

When a stronger player gives things away it could be a blunder but more often then not there is a good reason.  By taking you are potentially setting yourself up for disaster.  This happened in one game where I would've faced ruinous loss of material but got greedy and attempted to take.  I figured that I won something back but in doing so my opponent was able to deliver mate.  Something similar happened against both dynamic_dv and Jack Stockel.  In both cases I got greedy took a pawn and in doing so they were able to win the Queen for free.  That forced me into resignation shortly after.  The same thing is true here where white took and got mated.

Black has a few responses: Nxe4 exd4 and d6 being my favorite.  I don't like d6 since it allows White to get some pawns deep into my territory.  exd4 isn't bad at all but I like the tactical options of Nxe4 best.
259,12,3,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move strikes first blood for Black.  To regain parity White has several options dictating the flow of the remainder of the game.

As a general rule of thumb in early development try not to move your power pieces more than you have to and get your main pieces into play.  If you can do multiple things at once go for it.

Some might consider Bd6 here in mirrored play.  I'm not as much a fan of that line and symmetrical play tends to be more boring."

269,12,13,Nc3,b'r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',This move is the best White can make.  White is closer to finishing his development.  At first blush another strong consideration would be pushing the pawn to c5 however I don't think that helps much as it allows me to retreat my bishop to c7 making an easy match up for a queen/bishop diagonal.
270,12,14,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And now Black finishes his development not terribly concerned with the c4 pawn threat as there are several options to regain pawn parity.

Another move worthy of consideration is Bb5 looking for a bishop exchange.  White has two passed pawns which are a priority for me to something about.  If White can exchange pieces he should have more options for getting one of those two pawns downrange for promotion.

Sometimes you need to trade down to prevent more abuse.  White is basically in that position.  However there are always games where someone makes a mistake and you're glad you didn't trade.  White is starting to run out of options.

I recently found out that it's an inaccuracy as the way to proceed is with 4.c3 followed by 5.d4  The only time this works is when black plays ...b5 and you answer with Ba4 then c2-c3 followed by d3-d4 is no longer of an asset to black.  In fact learning that from this game is why I brought up the mainlines in the last annotation with Ted.  For the next couple of moves everything is standard.  Although the move order isn't the same as where reversion and I put it where we said it later I deem it appropriate to copy and paste the conversation here since we're talking about this anyway.  Joe: I also remember a game with Jack Stockel believe it or not. Forgot what it was but I got a pawn and then he got one back just when I thought it was without compensation. And it involved the same move as what I'm bound to play.  reversion: 4...Bc5?! is an innacuracy here. White will continue with 5.c3 intending d2-d4 stablishing a big control in the center. I'd only recommend an eventual Bc5 for Black in the 5...b5 6.Bb3 Bc5 line known as the Archangel Variation.

Joe:  If you had played 4...Bc5 then I would've developed my Nb1 But last week I remember what cplusplus11 said which is that in this position theory states that you castle right away. And I'm into theory which is also the logic behind the annotations involving TA's Q sacs. Joe has noted that knowing theory is very important. So when C++ told me about what they state it changed my attitude.

However a Rook wasn't an option so Mr. Stockel hit my pawn and N with his Queen.  In doing so he gained tempo and won the pawn back.  The same thing applies here.  Once he retreats I take back.  And then we swap off Knights.  On the other hand his DSB will be pinned though.
308,13,4,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p7/2n1R3/B7/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ2K1 b kq -',Seeing that my Ba4 is en-prise I protect.
309,13,5,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1pppbppp/p7/2n1R3/B7/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ2K1 w - -',And reversion gets his monarch to safety whilst breaking the pin.
310,13,6,1d3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pppbppp/p7/2n1R3/B7/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ2K1 b - -',?? The idea is opening up a line to complete development.  But this is where I start to go wrong.  Best was 10.Bb3 then would follow 10...Nxb3 11.axb3 (capturing towards the center).  By playing this he hits my Rook and after my retreat black will win material either a piece or two pawns.
311,13,7,1Bd6,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppp1ppp/p2b4/2n1R3/B7/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ2K1 w - -',It starts with this move as my Rook is attacked.
312,13,8,1Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppp1ppp/p2b4/2n5/B7/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',And I thought that aside from the tempo loss everythingelse holds.  But that is not so.  Once we exchange I'm in trouble.
313,13,9,Qh4,b'r1b2rk1/1ppp1ppp/p2b4/8/N6q/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',And it starts off here.  In this position I had a hard time deciding between allowing Qxh2+ or kick his Queen.  But playing 13.g3 would result in a loss of a piece.  I'd rather give up two pawns then a piece because a piece is worth more.  And an extra piece would make matters more difficult for me.
314,13,10,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/1ppp1ppp/p2b4/8/8/2NPB3/PPP1KPq1/R2QR3 b - -',Preventing 16...Rg1+ as black would have a forced mate.  17.Kd2 (forced) Bg5#
315,13,11,1b6,b'r1b2rk1/2pp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB3/PPP1KPq1/R2QR3 w - -',Fianchettoing his LSB.  The idea being is that this will allow reversion to complete his development.
316,13,12,1Rg1,b'r1b2rk1/2pp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB3/PPP1KPq1/R2Q2R1 b - -',Preventing 17...Qg4+  I had considered 17.Ne4 but only to exchange which I don't want due to being behind anyhow.  Although I could get out with 18.f3 another piece would be tied down after 18...Qg2+ 19.Bf2 Bc5 since my DSB is pinned.  And the one thing you don't want to do is voluntarily tie down your pieces.
317,13,13,1Qh3,b'r1b2rk1/2pp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB2q/PPP1KP2/R2Q2R1 w - -',So he pulls back.
318,13,14,1Kd2,b'r1b2rk1/2pp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P2/R2Q2R1 b - -',And now I do what I can to alleviate the exposure.  The plan is 19.Kc1.
319,13,15,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/1bpp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P2/R2Q2R1 w - -',What I didn't realize is that this move stops it until it's too late.
320,13,16,1Qe1,b'r4rk1/1bpp1ppp/pp1b4/8/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P2/R3Q1R1 b - -',?? Another idea was getting the monarch to d1 so the Q had to be moved.  The problem however is that reversion is going to win more material.  Best was 19.Rf1 keeping my Rook safe.
321,13,17,1Bh2,b'r4rk1/1bpp1ppp/pp6/8/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P1b/R3Q1R1 w - -',So he quick plays this.
322,13,18,2Rg5,b'r4rk1/1bpp1ppp/pp6/6R1/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P1b/R3Q3 b - -',Figuring that my Rook is defended.  Though I do calculate his next move.  But even after that it appeared that black wasn't going to win more material.
323,13,19,2f6,b'r4rk1/1bpp2pp/pp3p2/6R1/8/2NPB2q/PPPK1P1b/R3Q3 w - -',But this is when I figured out otherwise.  Calculating other variations I realize that anywherelse except for Rg3 or Rg1 gives black a free Rook.
324,13,20,2Rg3,b'r4rk1/1bpp2pp/pp3p2/8/8/2NPB1Rq/PPPK1P1b/R3Q3 b - -',Which I was not going to allow.
325,13,21,Rae8,b'4rrk1/1bpp2pp/pp3p2/8/8/2NPB1Pq/PPPK4/R3Q3 w - -',After the exchange he indirectly pins my Be3.
326,13,22,2Qf2,b'4rrk1/1bpp2pp/pp3p2/8/8/2NPB1Pq/PPPK1Q2/R7 b - -',And I try to get out of it.
327,13,23,2Qg2,b'4rrk1/1bpp2pp/pp3p2/8/8/2NPB1P1/PPPK1Qq1/R7 w - -',But the damage has been done.  As now after being down he will liquidate Queens.  Consequently we both agree on one thing.  Resignation is not premature at this point.  If this were against even the master mater I would not resign.  But reversion is a stronger player and against a 2300+ rated opponent I agreed that there was nothing else to learn here.  So I resigned.  Overall I would like to thank reversion for giving me this game as there was more to learn with the Ruy Lopez.
328,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"I wanted to try annotating a few games as a study exercise and decided to make it public as an afterthought. I chose a rather simple game to start with because annotating an entire game is not as easy as it appears! If you really want to get down most everything you understand about what is happening on the board it's a lot of work! But the idea was to do just that rerun the thought process write it all down and maybe some of the ideas that come out of it will stick. Many thanks to my opponent in this game which occurred in the 118th GK Tournament June 2014. Any comments or observations are welcome. For me this is a learning process and I need all the help I can get.

e4 developing a pawn to the center and opening diagonals for my queen and bishop."
329,14,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nc6 nothing wrong with this move. Could easily be seen as a prep for e5. Simple development of a knight to its natural square.
330,14,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 also simple development anticipating my opponents move to e5.
331,14,3,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq e6',e5 there it is. Grabbing a piece of the center and opening the diagonals for his bishop and queen.
332,14,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bb5 the Ruy Lopez. With this move white paves the way to castling and directly attacks the knight on c6. It has the additional benefit of casting a threatening eye on the black king. It's a marvelous move that loosely pins the knight as it inhibits moves like d6 or d5.
333,14,5,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"a6 a common reply. It's a move that ""put's the question to the bishop."" I forget who said that but it always struck me as funny and incredibly appropriate. The bishop now has to decide whether to attack or retreat."
334,14,6,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Ba4 the retreating option has the benefit of keeping up the pressure on blacks position. I play both variations attack and retreat and the retreat usually makes for a dicey game putting pressure on whites development especially when black replies with b5.
335,14,7,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',b5 oh no there it is. Dicey cramped game ahead. Blacks thinking is relieve the pressure on his knight and to push the bishop all the way back to the 3rd rank. At this point I am usually thinking about the best way to get my queenside development going. 
336,14,8,Bb3,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bb3 the bishop has no options. At the same time black has spent a lot of time jacking up his queenside pawn structure. This is a point I try to keep in mind as I sweat through my own queenside development. 
337,14,9,h6,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1pp1/p1n4p/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',h6 a common and much maligned move. I get it. As a preventative measure it will keep my knight or dark square bishop from occupying the lovely g5 square. But at this point in the game... probably not a good idea. Besides the queen is already protecting g5. Better to concentrate on true development. The moves Nf6 d6 Bc5 would all be better in my book. 
338,14,10,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1pp1/p1n4p/1p2p3/3PP3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',d4 grabbing another chunk of the center and attacking the pawn on e5. Another valid move would have been to castle but I wanted to get that development going and d4 opens a diagonal for my dark squared bishop. Also I considered Nc3 because the knight can get hemmed in  should black decide to play b4. 
339,14,11,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Nf6 a good developing move. Gets the knight out where it ought to be and attacks my undefended pawn on e4. A better move though would have been exd4. We would exchange knights and pawns and material would be equal. 
340,14,12,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p1Pp3/4P3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',e5 attacking his knight on c6 and taunting his knight on f6. It also inhibits blacks development somewhat as he is forced to move the knight. The pawn is strong as it's triple protected... the bishop on b3 the queen at d1 and the pawn at e4. All that said analysis engines rate it a 2nd class move preferring Nxe5 which would threaten a strong check at f7 should black should fail to retake on e5. I totally missed it during the game.
341,14,13,Ne7,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p4n1p/1p1Pp3/4P3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Ne7 a forced move that will further hinder his development. Black has options but he is running out of good ones. Na5 looks like his best move. Since I played d5 my bishop on b3 is now vulnerable and trapped.
342,14,14,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p4n1p/1p1PN3/4P3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"Nxe5 I could not resist the ""free"" pawn on e5. The move also attacks his weak spot at f7. "
343,14,15,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p6p/1p1PN3/4n3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Nxe4 now he has captured my pawn and is attacking my weakest point at f2. At the time I don't think I realized how bad a move this was for black but I certainly knew it was opening up some doors for me. f7 is now a blatantly obvious target. How to best proceed?
344,14,16,Qf3,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p6p/1p1PN3/4n3/1B3Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',"Qf3 still a bit early to bring my queen out perhaps but I see an opportunity I can't pass up. The move defends f2 attacks the knight and also targets blacks own weak square at f7. He has to defend f7 or the game will soon be over. 

Still a much better move would have been d6 opening up the diagonal to f7 for my bishop denying mobility to blacks d pawn and attacking the knight on e7 and the pawn at c7. Also a pawn on the 6th rank is always a dangerous threat because it's just two moves away from promotion. It would demand some attention. "
345,14,17,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p4n1p/1p1PN3/8/1B3Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Nf6 the knight retreats to f6 protecting the weak f7 square by covering it from the white queens attack. Better would have been Nd6 actually defending f7 as opposed to blocking it and would also have blocked my pawns advance to d6.
346,14,18,1d6,b'r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p2P1n1p/1p2N3/8/1B3Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',d6 better late than never. Now d7 is under a lot of pressure and he has a pawn on 6th rank to consider.
347,14,19,1Ned5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p2P1n1p/1p1nN3/8/1B3Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Ned5 not a good move but was perhaps his best. His position is so closed there was simply no good defense. Nfd5 would have been worse. 
348,14,20,1Bxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p2P1n1p/1p1BN3/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Bxd5 ouch! Removing the knight and forking the f7 square and the rook on a8. Also I don't think I even realized that the pawn on d6 was covering the e7 square until now. Blacks options are really limited at this point. Perhaps he could try Bxd6 cxd6 or even Qe7. All would save him from mate at least for the moment.
349,14,21,1Rb8,b'1rbqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p2P1n1p/1p1BN3/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQk -',Rb8 black has missed the mate and is saving the rook. 
350,14,22,1Bxf7#,b'1rbqkb1r/2pp1Bp1/p2P1n1p/1p2N3/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQk -',Bxf7#. The lessons here are many. First and  perhaps most important is to use your opening moves wisely. Black did himself no favors by playing such moves as b5 to chase my bishop around and h6 to ward off a threat that did not yet exist. Second play in the center is important and you need to fight for your piece of the center squares. Black had opportunities to get some play in the center but he passed them up and let my d pawn march right on through. Finally if you realize your weak point (f2 for white f7 for black) is under attack you MUST defend it as well as you possibly can. 
351,15,0,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So it starts off as a Nimzo-Indian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence
352,15,1,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is my usual reply.
353,15,2,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is quite a reasonable move.
354,15,3,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I continue with the plan.
355,15,4,d6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',"He seems to have a plan of putting his pawns on black squares.

356,15,5,Nge2,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',And I have a plan to stop him doubling my c pawns.
357,15,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',He is preparing e7-e5.
358,15,7,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP1BNPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now I am thinking that maybe if he takes on c3 I can take back with my bishop and have a nice diagonal for it after I move my d pawn.
359,15,8,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP1BNPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',And he castles.
360,15,9,a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',This seems to me to be a natural move but on the opening databases I use I can only find 0-0 here.
361,15,10,Ba5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I was slightly surprised he didn't take - there would have been some logic in taking and then putting more pawns on black squares.
362,15,11,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And finally I castle.

365,15,14,1Ne7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The knight drops back. This position was seen in Jeremic Veljko (2334) vs. Prelevic Dusko (2385)		2001.03.13 when white continued with Rb1. That plan did cross my mind but I chose something else - based on preventing his Bc8 finding any decent squares.
366,15,15,1Ng3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBP1N1/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is to stop his bishop - or his knight for that matter - coming to f5.
367,15,16,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P3b1/P1NBP1N1/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And the same move played in the previous game.
368,15,17,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P3b1/P1NBPPN1/1P1B2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The same reply.

370,15,19,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bnppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBPPNP/1P1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I am planning f3-f4 but I didn't want a black piece returning to g4.

372,15,21,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bnppp/p2p1n2/b1pPp3/2P2P2/P1NBP1NP/1P1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I continue with my plan.
373,15,22,1exf4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bnppp/p2p1n2/b1pP4/2P2p2/P1NBP1NP/1P1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',He takes.

But maybe f5 was a better move constricting black more and preventing his next move. It leaves e5 weak but it is hard for black to exploit that weakness. 
377,15,26,1Ng6,b'r1q2rk1/1p1b1ppp/p2p1nn1/b1pP4/2P2P2/P1NB2NP/1PQB2P1/R4RK1 w - -',So he moves his knight to a better square.

If he had taken on f5 I can't take back because he takes back on f5 by his rook and if I capture on f5 again then my rook on e1 is taken by his queen. Luckily it doesn't really spoil anything.

I could have kept my king in the centre but I definitely wanted to connect rooks with the possibilities of the queen side opening up. Instead I did consider b2-b4 here with the idea that if she took Qa4ch won the pawn back but it is not clear.
439,16,24,1O-O,b'nr1q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p1n1p/P1pPpP2/2P5/2NBBP2/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I was very pleased she followed suit!

Now the Icelandic is not possible anymore: if e6 dxe6 Bxe6 would be a fatal mistake due to Bxb7. Here the wisest move is clearly Nxd5 and then to stand some unconfortable position of the N. This was not the game I'd want to go in. 
485,17,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The idea is (dxe6ep) fxe6 and I would have had a strange position with a e4 to threat after which retake with the Q the d5 pawn. Probably bad but an interesting game to go.

(dxe6ep fxe6 keeping b7 guarded by the lsb). I'm not sure at all. But I can think: ""if my better ranged opponents is playing this it must be provoking my inmediate move dxf6ep so this must be good for him even if I can't see clearly why. So I better don't go for it and I play a (hopefully) ""safe"" move that ""can't be bad"" kind. (This is just a guess and it is NOT a mock or like. It's just the way I would have thought in his position. :-)"

I just want to surprise him. Instead of going after the pawn just developing. I can imagine that e4 would have been the stronger move: black can defend it: against Bg2 Bf5 Qe2 Qe7 it is a tense balance - but I just decided for this one. Can it be just bad? "
488,17,5,Bg2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bPp3/8/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Ok I see. I can't move my lsb or d6 threatening b7. Can I live with that?

This move pins my N. I can kick it with h6 and this leaves him BxN as only reasonable move (to retreat was just a loss of time). Do I want it? Welllll maybe I can exploit somehow the semiopen g column to attack his fianchetto - assuming he castles this way). Qxf6 was the safer move threatening f2 in return. I regret now I didn't play it. "

The pressure on the white diagonal does NOT increase since the Q is to fall if dxc6 Nc6 QxN+ bxQ Bxc6+ winning the Ra8. It's hard to see enough compensation. So I have to worry ONLY about the Bf5.

539,18,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This time however black responds with the French Defense.  But it's still in book and follows the main lines.
540,18,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I think I would've exchanged here with 3.exd5 exd5  But I like this move better.  Remember when I talked about those complicated variations that I watched by GM Susan Polgar in the French Defense involving the Terrasch Variation where white kicks the Knight?  Well that is going to happen here and with that I'm quite familiar with this.  Although I forgot about and moved on (for the obvious reason since I couldn't remember) the variations I studied with the Owen's and Grunfeld defenses I didn't forget about the Tarrasch Variation.  In part it was because it was by my favorite GM and the lines I studied were not only more common but much more difficult as well since it involves more theory.  One reason being is the same as if black were to play 4...Bc5 in the Ruy Lopez.  The idea is that white will get a solid pawn chain which Susan notes.  Therefore I remembered even more of them and mentioned a little about this in bipolarcorners annotation in his game against Reuben.  So the next few moves are still book and part of that variation.  In fact this game will help remember Terrasch even better since it actually happens here.
541,18,3,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',If I recall correctly Susan mentioned that f4 is often played in this variation to add another defender to e5.

Instead I would've completed development as white bringing my Bf1 into play.  But my inference is that it doesn't need to come out right away since this is his good bishop.  I think the idea is that once he castles both rooks will be connected.  If so I do see the point.  Back then I use to say pointless but with stronger players I've learned to say that I don't see the point.  In Joe's case however I'll at least try and often see the point in all of his moves.  The reason being is that what he says makes more sense to me then average.  Therefore it becomes second nature quicker then your average player.

Since this is not a Ruy Lopez theory does not say anything about castling sooner (to my knowing.)  I say this because tipsyjourneyman said that against stronger players you often finish developing and then as the last part of it you castle as Joe did.

553,18,15,1a3,b'r1bq1rk1/3nbppp/p1n1p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/P1N1BN2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 b - -',So Joe puts a stop to that.
554,18,16,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbppp/p1n1p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/P1N1BN2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Completing his development.  After which Joe will exchange material.  
555,18,17,1Rfd1,b'r2q1rk1/1b3ppp/p1n1p3/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N2N2/1PPQB1PP/R2R2K1 b - -',Centralizing his Rook.
556,18,18,1Qb6,b'r4rk1/1b3ppp/pqn1p3/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N2N2/1PPQB1PP/R2R2K1 w - -',Threatening a nasty discovered that might lead to mate in the long run.
557,18,19,1Qe3,b'r4rk1/1b3ppp/pqn1p3/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N1QN2/1PP1B1PP/R2R2K1 b - -',Like before Joe stops that.
558,18,20,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1b3ppp/pqn1p3/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N1QN2/1PP1B1PP/R2R2K1 w - -',Adding another defender to the c file.  But I don't see the point however because white does not have an immediate threat to my knowing.  I would've centralized my Rook with the same move so 15...Rad8 in this position.
559,18,21,1Bf1,b'2r2rk1/1b3ppp/pqn1p3/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N1QN2/1PP3PP/R2R1BK1 b - -',I do not know why Joe undeveloped his Bishop.
560,18,22,1h6,b'2r2rk1/1b3pp1/pqn1p2p/1pnpP3/5P2/P1N1QN2/1PP3PP/R2R1BK1 w - -',Like white's last move I don't know why black played.  But unlike with Joe I also don't see the point because he is advancing the pawn near the K when there does not appear to be a danger.
561,18,23,1Ne2,b'2r2rk1/1b3pp1/pqn1p2p/1pnpP3/5P2/P3QN2/1PP1N1PP/R2R1BK1 b - -',But this however makes sense as this gives Joe a better square for his Knight.
562,18,24,1Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/1b3pp1/pqn1p2p/1pnpP3/5P2/P3QN2/1PP1N1PP/R2R1BK1 w - -',So he responds by bringing his other Rook to the center as well.
563,18,25,1Rab1,b'2rr2k1/1b3pp1/pqn1p2p/1pnpP3/5P2/P3QN2/1PP1N1PP/1R1R1BK1 b - -',Adding an extra defender to b2.  In this position however I would've played 18.b4  Not only does this also defend the pawn but now black has pressure against his Nc5 and thus would lose time.  Since however Joe played this then it has to be best.  I'm just not sure what makes it better.  That's because I'm thinking of a line where Queens would be exchanged which would appear to leave white better.  What comes to mind is 21.b4 Na4 20.Qxb6 Nxb6  
564,18,26,1Nb8,b'1nrr2k1/1b3pp1/pq2p2p/1pnpP3/5P2/P3QN2/1PP1N1PP/1R1R1BK1 w - -',So black undevelops his N.  However I think that is an inaccuracy.  The reason being was due to a recent blitz Q sac I studied TA and his opponent in this case went wrong by leaving his N on the back rank.  In doing so Joe had more mobility with his Knight and was therefore able to force a win.
565,18,27,1Ned4,b'1nrr2k1/1b3pp1/pq2p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P3QN2/1PP3PP/1R1R1BK1 b - -',In fact this is a reason why I view 18...Nb8 as an inaccuracy.  With this move Knight pair is starting to become very dangerous in my opinion.
566,18,28,1Nbd7,b'2rr2k1/1b1n1pp1/pq2p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P3QN2/1PP3PP/1R1R1BK1 w - -',I'm not exactly sure why black played but my guess is to add a defender to his other Knight.  The reason it's just a guess is that his Nc5 appears well protected.
567,18,29,2c3,b'2rr2k1/1b1n1pp1/pq2p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P1P1QN2/1P4PP/1R1R1BK1 b - -',Adding an extra defender to his Nd4  Normally it would be the same idea as before where I wouldn't understand the logic since the Knight is not in danger.  But in this position I find it useful.  While appearing weak Joe gets another pawn.  And despite them isolated with the N in between even though they're not passers those pawns are extremely dangerous.
568,18,30,2Qc7,b'2rr2k1/1bqn1pp1/p3p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P1P1QN2/1P4PP/1R1R1BK1 w - -',I don't know why black played this.
569,18,31,2Bd3,b'2rr2k1/1bqn1pp1/p3p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P1PBQN2/1P4PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',But this move however makes sense as now Joe's bishop is in a better spot.  However black will exchange (presumably because he's worried about white's Bd3.)
570,18,32,Nc5,b'2rr2k1/1bq2pp1/p3p2p/1pnpP3/3N1P2/P1PRQN2/1P4PP/1R4K1 w - -',In the after math black puts pressure on Joe's Rd3 to gain time.
571,18,33,Ne4,b'2rr2k1/1bq2pp1/p3p2p/1p1pP3/3NnP2/P1P1QN2/1P4PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',I do not know why black played this.
572,18,34,2Nb3,b'2rr2k1/1bq2pp1/p3p2p/1p1pP3/4nP2/PNP1QN2/1P4PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',But I believe that Joe moved here to maintain control of the center.  Normally I wouldn't know why but I recently learned that center control is important even when we're not in the opening.
573,18,35,2Ba8,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/p3p2p/1p1pP3/4nP2/PNP1QN2/1P4PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',To prevent white from hitting black's LSB which I believe was Joe's plan.
574,18,36,2Rd4,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/p3p2p/1p1pP3/3RnP2/PNP1QN2/1P4PP/1R4K1 b - -',I think the idea behind this move was to double up on one column since this makes it possible for Joe to place his other Rook on the d file.
575,18,37,2a5,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/4p2p/pp1pP3/3RnP2/PNP1QN2/1P4PP/1R4K1 w - -',Threatening ...a4 which would cost white valuable.
576,18,38,2Nfd2,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/4p2p/pp1pP3/3RnP2/PNP1Q3/1P1N2PP/1R4K1 b - -',So Joe answers by threatening to exchange on e4.  Doing this will give black doubled pawns.  It would cause damage in this position.  Although no one has an advantage at this point I favor white's position here.
577,18,39,2a4,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/4p2p/1p1pP3/p2RnP2/PNP1Q3/1P1N2PP/1R4K1 w - -',So black attacks white's N.
578,18,40,2Nc1,b'b1rr2k1/2q2pp1/4p2p/1p1pP3/p2RnP2/P1P1Q3/1P1N2PP/1RN3K1 b - -',But Joe has a plan by bringing his hanging Knight here.  Although it does appear undeveloped and cramped there's more to it then meets the eye.  What redfoxrising alluded to in a Q sac (that I annotated where a player near his strength times out) Knights can move in different places.  Although they don't appear so they're about as much as or more then a bishop.  And that's what often makes them dangerous.
579,18,41,2Rd7,b'b1r3k1/2qr1pp1/4p2p/1p1pP3/p2RnP2/P1P1Q3/1P1N2PP/1RN3K1 w - -',I don't know why meilajb played this since he is not going to double up on one column.  But Joe however will use that time to get Nc1 to a better outpost starting with the next move.
580,18,42,Nc5,b'b1r3k1/2qr1pp1/4p2p/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q3/1P1NN1PP/1R4K1 w - -',Since as we're seeing frequently I don't see the point of this move.  Since this keeps happening there's a lot that I'm missing which is another way of knowing that Joe is facing strong opposition.
581,18,43,2Ng3,b'b1r3k1/2qr1pp1/4p2p/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q1N1/1P1N2PP/1R4K1 b - -',Meanwhile Joe finds a stronger outpost for his Knight as noted earlier.
582,18,44,2g6,b'b1r3k1/2qr1p2/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q1N1/1P1N2PP/1R4K1 w - -',But I do see the point here.  Although it's not a pawn chain by definition g6 and h6 are connected pawns which are also known to be dangerous.
583,18,45,3Rf1,b'b1r3k1/2qr1p2/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q1N1/1P1N2PP/5RK1 b - -',Adding another defender to f4.
584,18,46,3Re7,b'b1r3k1/2q1rp2/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q1N1/1P1N2PP/5RK1 w - -',So Joe's opponent puts more pressure by adding an extra attacker.
585,18,47,3Ne2,b'b1r3k1/2q1rp2/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q3/1P1NN1PP/5RK1 b - -',At first I didn't know why or see the point to Joe playing this.  But with another look it makes sense because if black does an eventual ...h6-h4 pawn push there won't be any pressure on white's Knight.  Consequently TA is preventing a possible tempo loss.
586,18,48,3Kg7,b'b1r5/2q1rpk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q3/1P1NN1PP/5RK1 w - -',Normally the move makes sense but in this position I don't see the point.  The idea being is that the monarch becomes a weapon in the endgame which is when you want to bring it out.  But before that you don't want it out as otherwise it would become exposed.  In fact GM Susan Polgar noted that in our e-mail course.  But we have not reached the endgame yet.
587,18,49,3Rf3,b'b1r5/2q1rpk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1QR2/1P1NN1PP/6K1 b - -',I presume that Joe is punishing black for his last move.  The idea being that white's Queen combined with Rf1 will put pressure on g6 and h6.  Enough of this would prove overwhelming for the other side.
588,18,50,3Bc6,b'2r5/2q1rpk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1QR2/1P1NN1PP/6K1 w - -',Bringing his B to a better spot in my opinion.
589,18,51,3Rh3,b'2r5/2q1rpk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1NN1PP/6K1 b - -',As noted earlier I think the idea is putting pressure on the K side. 
590,18,52,3Rh8,b'7r/2q1rpk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1NN1PP/6K1 w - -',But black defends against that.
591,18,53,3Nf3,b'7r/2q1rpk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1QN1R/1P2N1PP/6K1 b - -',Bringing his Nd2 to a better place.  I also think that Joe intends to at some point put pressure back on black's K side.  Since a Knight added to the mix can be quite nasty.
592,18,54,3Ree8,b'4r2r/2q2pk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p2R1P2/P1P1QN1R/1P2N1PP/6K1 w - -',Although the columns are not on the same file by definition the Rooks are connected on the same rank so they're doubled up.  And that can be just as dangerous and possibly more so then two rooks on one file.
593,18,55,3Rd1,b'4r2r/2q2pk1/2b1p1pp/1pnpP3/p4P2/P1P1QN1R/1P2N1PP/3R2K1 b - -',At first I didn't know why Joe played this but it makes sense.  That's because black was intending to play 35...Nb3 which would cost him tempo to defend his Rook.  By moving here if black brings his to Knight to b3 it's no longer a concern.
594,18,56,3Bd7,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p4P2/P1P1QN1R/1P2N1PP/3R2K1 w - -',Normally I wouldn't see the point except that black is adding a defender e6.  Might seem irrelevant though but this makes his pawn chain more dangerous.  I had a similar position against Jack Stockel in a game I should've won.  I was up a Queen for Rook and then some.  But a simple mistake lost the game by failing to exchange Rook for Bishop.  In the end although I had 3 pawns he had a bishop connected with his other two pawns which proved to be lethal.  Although the same cannot be said here the idea however applies.
595,18,57,3Ned4,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2N1P2/P1P1QN1R/1P4PP/3R2K1 b - -',Still getting a better position for his Knights.
596,18,58,3Ne4,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1p1pP3/p2NnP2/P1P1QN1R/1P4PP/3R2K1 w - -',I don't see the point because with this move...
597,18,59,3Nd2,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1p1pP3/p2NnP2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/3R2K1 b - -',White want's to exchange Knights.  The reason I didn't see the point above was the failure to understand how that Knight on e4 is dangerous.  In fact it's something that still doesn't make sense but what I do is that if Joe wants to eliminate it then there's way more to it then meets the eye as black's Ne4 is threatening to do something.  I just don't know what it is.
598,18,60,3Nc5,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/3R2K1 w - -',But black doesn't allow that.  So now it's obvious that there's something crucial with that Knight.  I just have no idea what it is.
599,18,61,3Re1,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/4R1K1 b - -',In general a Rook behind the Queen on the same file is also very dangerous.  I've seen examples in GM games as well as some of their annotations.  In fact in one particular annotated game I studied there were variations.  And one of them included both on the same file which would've been overwhelming for the other side.  
600,18,62,3Rec8,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/4R1K1 w - -',So black does the same thing.
601,18,63,3Kh1,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1pp/1pnpP3/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/4R2K b - -',Jack has told me that bringing your monarch in the corner at some point is part of King safety.  I have gotten it wrong of when to do that because in one game I was lost either way.  In another I seem to recall Kh1 putting me a disadvantage.  So it's about knowing but with what's unfolding I'm starting to see where that applies.
602,18,64,3h5,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP2p/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P1N2PP/4R2K w - -',And now has a solid pawn chain as well.  Although we're only at move 40 I think that with best play the game will end in a draw which will become a reality much later on.
603,18,65,4Nd2f3,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP2p/p2N1P2/P1P1QN1R/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',Joe's Knight is better placed here.
604,18,66,4Rce8,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP2p/p2N1P2/P1P1QN1R/1P4PP/4R2K w - -',Putting pressure on the e file in the long run.
605,18,67,4Ng5,b'4r2r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',And I like this placement even better because if that Knight could reach the seventh it would have the potential to become very dangerous.  And that's a well known fact since I've lost two or three games by allowing that.
606,18,68,4Qb6,b'4r2r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P1Q2R/1P4PP/4R2K w - -',I don't know why black played.  But I believe that the aim is to tie down white's Nd4.
607,18,69,4Qf2,b'4r2r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1P3QPP/4R2K b - -',But as usual Joe has an answer to that.
608,18,70,4Reb8,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1P3QPP/4R2K w - -',Like before a Rook behind the Queen is known to be dangerous.
609,18,71,4Rf1,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1P3QPP/5R1K b - -',So Joe has the same idea in mind.

611,18,73,Qc7,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1P3QPP/3R3K w - -',I think that as noted earlier black once again has the same idea as before.  It makes sense now however because while not right away in the long run he is threatening c3.
612,18,74,4Qc2,b'2r4r/2qb1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1PQ3PP/3R3K b - -',So Joe protects it.
613,18,75,4Qb6,b'2r4r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1PQ3PP/3R3K w - -',I don't see the point since Joe will move his other Rook.
614,18,76,Rh6,b'2r5/3b1pk1/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/3R3K w - -',While not immediately in the long run black is putting pressure on Joe's Ng5.  The idea is ...h4 and when white's retreats his Rg3 black would answer with ...Rh5  Although the Knight is defended I sense that black has a plan more dangerous then this.
615,18,77,4Qc1,b'2r5/3b1pk1/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P4PP/2QR3K b - -',Since Joe moved here.  But I think it's because white might have a more dangerous plan here.  I think he intends to exchange pawns with f4-f5 followed by ...PXP and NXP the Rook is en-prise and protecting would mean the loss of tempo.
616,18,78,4Rhh8,b'2r4r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P4PP/2QR3K w - -',So black prevents that at once.
617,18,79,4Qb1,b'2r4r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P4PP/1Q1R3K b - -',So Joe comes up with a different plan.  Not sure unless black calculated in advance (which I believe.)  But it appears that Joe is intending to play Nxe6 with the idea of ...fxe6 allowing Qxg6  However that is too easy as experienced don't do this.  On the other hand I am analyzing that line as that's a start to doing something without oversights.  Lately when calculating variations I miss something and am thus incorrect especially in complex positions like this.  So to cut down on it I start with the easy way and then work my out so when calculating sample lines I can do it with less inaccuracies.
618,18,80,4Rh6,b'2r5/3b1pk1/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P4PP/1Q1R3K w - -',But black also prevents that possibility.

621,18,83,5Qe2,b'2r3k1/3b1p2/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P2Q1PP/3R3K b - -',With this move black will face some tension.  It involves the same thing that I mentioned about 5-10 moves ago.  And it is back.  The idea is putting pressure from g1-b6 with his Queen.
622,18,84,5Qa6,b'2r3k1/3b1p2/q3p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P2Q1PP/3R3K w - -',In response black plays this.

In fact I solved a chess puzzle with two Knights like this that might have been used to deliver mate.
626,18,88,5Kf8,b'2r2k1r/3b1p2/q3p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p4P2/P1P1QNR1/1P4PP/3R3K w - -',Since it appears to be a potential threat black prevents that possibility by playing this.
627,18,89,5Re1,b'2r2k1r/3b1p2/q3p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p4P2/P1P1QNR1/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',Going back to the Rook behind Queen method.
628,18,90,5Qa7,b'2r2k1r/q2b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p4P2/P1P1QNR1/1P4PP/4R2K w - -',I don't know why black played this.
629,18,91,5Nd4,b'2r2k1r/q2b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P1Q1R1/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',I also don't know why Joe moved here.  But my guess would be saccing his N for pawn to get something dangerous known as a positional sac.
630,18,92,5Qb7,b'2r2k1r/1q1b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P1Q1R1/1P4PP/4R2K w - -',How I came up with this inference is due to black playing this as now with added protection that sac will not work.
631,18,93,5Qe2,b'2r2k1r/1q1b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P2Q1PP/4R2K b - -',If my instincts were correct I presume that Joe makes another attempt at that.  Or he might have something more dangerous.
632,18,94,5Re8,b'4rk1r/1q1b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P2Q1PP/4R2K w - -',Since black answers with this move.
633,18,95,5Qc2,b'4rk1r/1q1b1p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/4R2K b - -',I am not sure why Joe played this.
634,18,96,5Bc8,b'2b1rk1r/1q3p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/4R2K w - -',Likewise I'm not sure why black moved here.  And for me not knowing the logic behind certain moves is quite good as it shows just how much theory the game contains.
635,18,97,5Kg1,b'2b1rk1r/1q3p2/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/4R1K1 b - -',This is the late middle game and as we approach the end game the King will become a powerful weapon.  With that being said Joe is already mobilizing his monarch and preparing to do battle with it.
636,18,98,5Kg7,b'2b1r2r/1q3pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/4R1K1 w - -',Black has the same idea in mind.  Normally I'd say that we have reached the distant opposition except that it's too soon since not only isn't it the endgame yet but there are just too many pawns to call it that.  And I learned that in charleshiggie's last annotation when ION noted that.  However this move is still very good because black is threatening to do damage of his own as we'll see later on.
637,18,99,5Rd1,b'2b1r2r/1q3pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 b - -',I'm not sure why Joe played this.  At first I thought that it was to add a defender Nd4 as what originally went through my mind was 58....Nb3 which would appear to cost white tempo since it would appear that TA has to get his N out of harm's way.  But white can just exchange.  So for example 58...Nb3 59.Nxb3 axb3 60.Qxb3
638,18,100,5Rhg8,b'2b1r1r1/1q3pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 w - -',But I do not know what this move accomplishes and thus don't see the point.  If black was going to play 59...Kh8 it would make sense.  However that does not happen.
639,18,101,5Rf3,b'2b1r1r1/1q3pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P2R2/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 b - -',I do however see the logic here.  Although not immediate at some point black might have decided to threaten f4 (which is an important pawn.)  But this move however adds an extra defender so that if black decides to attack it that won't be of a concern.
640,18,102,5Bd7,b'4r1r1/1q1b1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P2R2/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 w - -',Mobilizing his Rd8.  It was a little mobile but this really adds to it and as we know mobility is essential.  
641,18,103,6Rh3,b'4r1r1/1q1b1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 b - -',As usual I did Homework by trying to figure out why Joe played this.  But this time I figured it out without having to guess.  In this position white intends to sac his Rook a pawn.  The idea being is that if black takes TA will mate.  And if he is to avoid that black would lose a pawn.  So the threat is 61.Rxh5 and if 61...gxh5?? 62.Qh7+ Kf8 (forced) 63.Qxf7#
642,18,104,6Rgh8,b'4r2r/1q1b1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P4R/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 w - -',So black stops that cold since now he has an extra defender to prevent 61.Rxh5.
643,18,105,6Rg3,b'4r2r/1q1b1pk1/4p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 b - -',However black might have had a plan to be concerned about starting with 61...f6 with the idea being 62.exf6 Kxf6 followed by 63...Rf8 making it difficult to defend the f pawn.  So Joe doesn't take chances.
644,18,106,6Rh6,b'4r3/1q1b1pk1/4p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1PQ3PP/3R2K1 w - -',I don't see the point behind this is move because and in fact view it as a blunder.  This appeares to restrict black's mobile Rook and the idea being is that in general you don't want to restrict the mobility of your pieces as that's a recipe for a disaster.  
645,18,107,6Qf2,b'4r3/1q1b1pk1/4p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/3R2K1 b - -',Therefore it would appear that Joe is punishing black for his last move.  But what I thought doesn't happen.  The plan seemed to be 63.Rh3 followed by 64.Qh4 which would be my reason behind this move.  However TA does not play that.
646,18,108,6Qb6,b'4r3/3b1pk1/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/3R2K1 w - -',Adding an extra defender to his Nc5 should Joe move his Nd4.
647,18,109,6Kh1,b'4r3/3b1pk1/1q2p1pr/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/3R3K b - -',Knowing this Joe brings his monarch to the corner instead.
648,18,110,6Rhh8,b'4r2r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p2N1P2/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/3R3K w - -',And black remobilizes his Rook.
649,18,111,6Ndf3,b'4r2r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p4P2/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/3R3K b - -',Like before Joe aligns his Knights together.  Even in endgames this applies so he is maintaining center control.
650,18,112,6Reb8,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpP1Np/p4P2/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/3R3K w - -',Bringing his Rook behind the Queen again.
651,18,113,6f5,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2p1p1/1pnpPPNp/p7/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/3R3K b - -',But Joe threatens a nasty check.  It turns out that 66.f6+ would be very dangerous as white's pawn chain would be overwhelming for black.
652,18,114,6exf5,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q4p1/1pnpPpNp/p7/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/3R3K w - -',So black prevents problems by taking this way.  It's important to note that taking the other way would lose immediately as white would mate.  65...gxf5?? 66.Nxe6+ Kh6 (forced) 67.Qe3+ Kh7 (forced) 68.Rg7# 
653,18,115,6Rxd5,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q4p1/1pnRPpNp/p7/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/7K b - -',Not surprisingly Joe takes back.
654,18,116,6f4,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q4p1/1pnRP1Np/p4p2/P1P2NR1/1P3QPP/7K w - -',So black defends the Rook.
655,18,117,6Nh4,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q4p1/1pnRP1Np/p4p1N/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/7K b - -',Instead of defending Joe brings one of his Knight to the rim.
656,18,118,6Ne6,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2n1p1/1p1RP1Np/p4p1N/P1P3R1/1P3QPP/7K w - -',"Since black didn't capture it's safe to conclude that ""To take is a mistake.""  With even more to learn I studied what would happen if black played 67...fxg3 as Homework because this is very good practice due to a tactical exercise.  It turns out that black would lose his Queen as the only way to avoid mate would mean giving it up after 68.Qxf7+ Kh6 69.Rd6  Therefore he comes up with a new plan by attacking white's Queen."
657,18,119,6Qf1,b'1r5r/3b1pk1/1q2n1p1/1p1RP1Np/p4p1N/P1P3R1/1P4PP/5Q1K b - -',"Which Joe protects.  Right after this however black will exchange Knights.  It does make sense though since white's Ng5 appears dangerous.  Even if not why chance it?  The idea behind my last sentence goes with a well known chess fact which is ""Never trust your opponent.""  After the exchange however black's Bd7 will become a target."
658,18,120,Bg4,b'1r5r/5pk1/1q4p1/1p1RP1Rp/p4pbN/P1P5/1P4PP/5Q1K w - -',So he defends.  I don't know why but right after this however Joe will sac his Knight for a pawn.
659,18,121,7Rd6,b'1r5r/6k1/1q1R2p1/1p2P1Rp/p4pb1/P1P5/1P4PP/5Q1K b - -',My guess is to gain tempo since black must defend.  But my other instinct is that Joe might have more dangerous up his sleeve.
660,18,122,7Qb1,b'1r5r/6k1/3R2p1/1p2P1Rp/p4pb1/P1P1q3/1P4PP/1Q5K b - -',That is due to this move since he is threatening an immediate 73.Qxg6#
661,18,123,7Kf8,b'1r3k1r/8/3R2p1/1p2P1Rp/p4pb1/P1P1q3/1P4PP/1Q5K w - -',So black prevents that.
662,18,124,7Rf6+,b'1r3k1r/8/5Rp1/1p2P1Rp/p4pb1/P1P1q3/1P4PP/1Q5K b - -',But that will not stop Joe from placing black in check.
663,18,125,7Ke7,b'1r5r/4k3/5Rp1/1p2P1Rp/p4pb1/P1P1q3/1P4PP/1Q5K w - -',The only other option was 73...Kg7 and I was trying to calculate what would happen after that starting with a discovered check by the Rook which would result in mate.  But then (without analyzing the board) I quickly figured out that white would do that immediately with 74.Qxg6#
664,18,126,7Rgxg6,b'1r5r/4k3/5RR1/1p2P2p/p4pb1/P1P1q3/1P4PP/1Q5K b - -',But this will not stop Joe from trying since he takes.
665,18,127,7Qxe5,b'1r5r/4k3/5RR1/1p2q2p/p4pb1/P1P5/1P4PP/1Q5K w - -',But black stops this by taking Joe's dangerous passed pawn.  However white will continue to gain tempo by repeatedly placing black in check.
666,18,128,Kc7,b'1r4Rr/2k5/5RQ1/1p2q2p/p4pb1/P1P5/1P4PP/7K w - -',The only difference is that in this position I might have played 77...Rxg8 to prevent white's next move since I don't see an immediate back rank mate afterwards.
667,18,129,Bd7,b'1r4Rr/2kb1R2/6Q1/1p2q2p/p4p2/P1P5/1P4PP/7K w - -',This however is where the fun begins as Joe is going to sac his Rook for Bishop.
668,18,130,8Rg7+,b'1r5r/3k2R1/6Q1/1p2q2p/p4p2/P1P5/1P4PP/7K b - -',And now Joe decides to sac his other Rook for a Queen.  It appears to be forced win for black but as we'll see later on there's much to this story then meets the eye.
669,18,131,8Qf6+,b'1r5r/8/2k2Q2/1p5p/p4p2/P1P5/1P4PP/7K b - -',For now this is the last check that Joe has against meilajb.
670,18,132,8h4,b'1r5r/1k6/5Q2/1p5p/p4p1P/P1P5/1P4P1/7K b - h3',Preventing black from getting an open file.  As we know open files are very dangerous especially since black has another Rook on the same rank.
671,18,133,8Rbc8,b'2r4r/1k6/5Q2/1p5p/p4p1P/P1P5/1P4P1/7K w - -',I don't know what this move accomplishes.  Instead I might have played 83...Rbd8 with the idea of 84...Rd1+ 85.Kh2 Rd2 followed by 86...f3.
672,18,134,8Kg1,b'2r4r/1k6/5Q2/1p5p/p4p1P/P1P5/1P4P1/6K1 b - -',But Joe prepares for the f4-f2 march with this move as now his monarch is more active.
673,18,135,8Ka7,b'2r4r/k7/5Q2/1p5p/p4p1P/P1P5/1P4P1/6K1 w - -',I'm not sure why black moved here but I deem to be a mistake because Joe is going to win a pawn.  Instead I would've brought one of my Rooks to f8 to protect f4 whilst gaining tempo.
674,18,136,Ka6,b'2r4r/8/k7/1p5p/p4Q1P/P1P5/1P4P1/6K1 w - -',One thing is for sure however.  As noted earlier in the endgame the monarch is a dangerous weapon.
675,18,137,8g4,b'2r4r/8/k7/1p5p/p4QPP/P1P5/1P6/6K1 b - g3',At first I thought that Joe was trying to promote with his passed pawn on h4.  But black's Rh8 stops that.  Instead white is saccing a pawn to gain tempo.  That's because when meilajb takes TA will place him in check.
676,18,138,Ka5,b'2r4r/8/5Q2/kp6/p5pP/P1P5/1P6/6K1 w - -',Still keeping his monarch mobile.  And the King around a pawn chain is also dangerous.  Although it won't work here in general a position like this would result in promoting a pawn.  The only thing that stops it in this position is white's a3.  But usually you don't have a pawn to block it.  For example Jack Stockel in a previous game was going to promote in a similar situation which is why I resigned there.
677,18,139,8Qg7,b'2r4r/6Q1/8/kp6/p5pP/P1P5/1P6/6K1 b - -',Instead of taking on h4 (which is what I would've done) he threatens g4.
678,18,140,8Kb6,b'2r4r/6Q1/1k6/1p6/p5pP/P1P5/1P6/6K1 w - -',Likewise instead of taking black moves his King.  But it makes sense here because this is triangulation since he played 85...Ka6 followed by 87...Ka5 and then 88...Kb6 so it's moved in a triangle.  And this trigonometric method is very useful in endgames but especially in this position.
679,18,141,8h5,b'2r4r/6Q1/1k6/1p5P/p5p1/P1P5/1P6/6K1 b - -',"So Joe continues to advance his passer since ""passed pawn must be pushed."""
680,18,142,8Rcd8,b'3r3r/6Q1/1k6/1p5P/p5p1/P1P5/1P6/6K1 w - -',I'm not sure why black moved here.  But in my mind one move is as good or as bad as the other.  With that being said I just would not know what to do here.
681,18,143,9h6,b'3r3r/6Q1/1k5P/1p6/p5p1/P1P5/1P6/6K1 b - -',As white however this is what I also would've played as Joe keeps pushing his passer.
682,18,144,9Kc5,b'3r3r/6Q1/7P/1pk5/p5p1/P1P5/1P6/6K1 w - -',Continuing his triangulation.
683,18,145,9Qc7+,b'3r3r/2Q5/7P/1pk5/p5p1/P1P5/1P6/6K1 b - -',But Joe places him in check.  And when he gets out...
684,18,146,9Kg2,b'3r3r/2Q5/7P/1p1k4/p5p1/P1P5/1P4K1/8 b - -',Joe will use his monarch as a weapon this time.
685,18,147,9Ke4,b'3r3r/2Q5/7P/1p6/p3k1p1/P1P5/1P4K1/8 w - -',So does black.
686,18,148,9Qc6+,b'3r3r/8/2Q4P/1p6/p3k1p1/P1P5/1P4K1/8 b - -',But Joe checks again.  And when black gets out white will win a pawn again.
687,18,149,9Kg3,b'3r3r/8/6kP/1Q6/p5p1/P1P3K1/1P6/8 b - -',This time it's safe to say that we now have the distant opposition.
688,18,150,9Rd2,b'7r/8/6kP/1Q6/p5p1/P1P3K1/1P1r4/8 w - -',Threatening b2 but Joe answers by exchanging pawns afterwards he'll go back to continuously placing black in check.
689,18,151,9Qe4+,b'7r/7k/7P/8/4Q1p1/P1P3K1/1r6/8 b - -',Meanwhile black will get back a pawn again.
690,18,152,10Qd3+,b'7r/8/6k1/8/6p1/P1PQ2K1/1r6/8 b - -',Normally I'd annotate the rest but I go by what TA outlines.  Therefore I don't think it's necessary until the very end as this where I believe the theory ends.  In it he notes that for the rest of this game Joe sees that it is drawn.  In fact he sees this even earlier.  But I'm not sure exactly when.  Starting now he offers black a draw which gets turned out.  Throughout the rest of the game he offers black a draw on two occassions but meilajb declines.  tactical_abyss even sends his opponent some messages on why he thinks it's drawn without a response. 
691,18,153,Rd4+,b'8/8/1Q6/5r2/2kr4/8/3K4/8 w - -',At last a draw is agreed on by both sides to make a long story short.  The moral of this story and theory is that a Queen against both Rooks is a book draw.  Overall I'd like to thank Joe for showing this game.  Without the lecture I would not have known about it so this annotation would not have been possible.
692,19,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So it starts with a Queen's Gambit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit
693,19,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He plays the Slav variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense
694,19,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is all very conventional and usual.

696,19,4,Bg5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I'm trying to play it like a normal Queen's Gambit. I later found out that this too is the 5th most popular move after 5. e3 cxd5 Qb3 or g3. It doesn't score very well and will not repeat it.
697,19,5,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This seems logical.

699,19,7,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This is sensible development.
700,19,8,Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3pNbB1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This may be a mistake. It is not on the world database but it is on the database of games played on Gameknot. There it does score 4 wins out of 4 for white!
701,19,9,Nbd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3pNbB1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',So he continues to develop.
702,19,10,f4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3pNbB1/2PP1P2/2N1P3/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',This is probably over-optimistic too although it has been successfully played in the Gameknot game anyhumanheart (1649) vs. zorakblaster (1658) which continued with Nxe5 9. dxe5 Ne4 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Nxe4 Bxe4 12. cxd5 Bxd5?? which lost the bishop after 12. cxd5 Bxd5 13. Qc2 O-O 14. Bd3 Kh8 15. O-O h6 16. e4. Any other pawn capture on move 12 leads to similar positions to the game and presumably an edge for black.
703,19,11,h6,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3pNbB1/2PP1P2/2N1P3/PP4PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This is another good move by black. I probably should have started exchanging minor pieces now.
704,19,12,Bh4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3pNb2/2PP1P1B/2N1P3/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',But I stubbornly played this.

762,20,1,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/P7/1PP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now I've had people question the motive behind pawn a3 or pawn h3 but it's because it helps me set up future positions and a safe point if it comes to pass in the future. Obviously we are only 2 moves into this game so I don't know what will happen further down the line.

Also this is where the alt checkmate would come into play if he moved Black pawn to f6 to threaten knight I'd move Bishop to C4 (check) which opens my queen to freely take his.

There's a nice YouTube video mjshark titled: ""Traps in the Englund Gambit (1.d4 e5?!)"" if you're interested. I wish I have found this during the game. I wasn't familiar with this opening and by dumb luck avoided one of the more common traps (see move 4). Multiple responses here but taking the pawn is really the only sound approach I could find. Here are some others I reviewed: (a) 2. d5 - pass the pawn. Gives white a temporary advanced position but seems difficult to defend in the long run and leaves a gaping hole behind it. (2) 2. c3 - defend the pawn. Provides an unlikely potential swap of a wing pawn for a central pawn. While I'm waiting for the swap it hems in the Queen side knight. (3) 2. dxe5 - take the pawn. Seems to be the right move gains early material and opens things up a bit. Unlikely I can keep the material advantage but early +1 against a master can help build confidence! (4) 2. Nf3 - defend the pawn. Leads to the knight running around the board in the early game allowing black to develop. Didn't seem like a great idea."

916,23,57,Rc7,b'4nk2/2r2pp1/R1p4p/1pPp4/1P3P2/3BPK1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',White has won a pawn and black is still passive. Having said that white's extra pawn is doubled so there is still some work to do. 
917,23,58,3e4,b'4nk2/2r2pp1/R1p4p/1pPp4/1P2PP2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 b - -',White hopes black will exchange on e4.
918,23,59,3Nf6,b'5k2/2r2pp1/R1p2n1p/1pPp4/1P2PP2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',Black wisely doesn't

920,23,61,3Nd7,b'5k2/2rn1pp1/R1p4p/1pPpP3/1P3P2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',and the knight drops back.

922,23,63,3Ke7,b'R7/2rnkpp1/2p4p/1pPpP3/1P3P2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',More or less forced.
923,23,64,3Rg8,b'6R1/2rnkpp1/2p4p/1pPpP3/1P3P2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 b - -',and now white attacks on the king side too.
924,23,65,3g6,b'6R1/2rnkp2/2p3pp/1pPpP3/1P3P2/3B1K1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',Black saves the pawn.
925,23,66,3Bxg6,b'6R1/2rnkp2/2p3Bp/1pPpP3/1P3P2/5K1P/1P4P1/8 b - -',But white comes up with this bishop sacrifice leaving white with four connected passed unstopable king side pawns.
926,23,67,4Rh6,b'8/2rnk3/2p4R/1pPpP2p/1P3P2/5K1P/1P4P1/8 b - -',Black now needs to counter-attack with Ra7 but is still in defensive mode.
927,23,68,4Ke3,b'5r2/3nk3/2p5/1pPpP2R/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 b - -',Presumably Ke3 is to break the pin on the f file.
928,23,69,4Rf7,b'8/3nkr2/2p5/1pPpP2R/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 w - -',Black misses his last chance for activity with Ra8. 
929,23,70,4Rh6,b'8/3nkr2/2p4R/1pPpP3/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 b - -',Not sure this achieves much - white just needs to advance his pawns.
930,23,71,4Nb8,b'1n6/4kr2/2p4R/1pPpP3/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 w - -',This doesn't achieve much.
931,23,72,4Rd6,b'1n6/4kr2/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 b - -',White wastes another move just advancing with g2-g4 is better.
932,23,73,4Rg7,b'1n6/4k1r1/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3P2/4K2P/1P4P1/8 w - -',Black attacks.
933,23,74,4Kf3,b'1n6/4k1r1/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3P2/5K1P/1P4P1/8 b - -',White correctly protects with the king. g2-g4 would have been met with Rg7-h7 and the h pawn is dropping and black has chances again.
934,23,75,4Rf7,b'1n6/4kr2/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3P2/5K1P/1P4P1/8 w - -',Perhaps hoping for a repetition.
935,23,76,4g4,b'1n6/4kr2/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 b - g3',At last!
936,23,77,4Nd7,b'8/3nkr2/2pR4/1pPpP3/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 w - -',Knight comes back.
937,23,78,4e6,b'8/3nkr2/2pRP3/1pPp4/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 b - -',Only to be lost.
938,23,79,4Rf8,b'5r2/3nk3/2pRP3/1pPp4/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 w - -',Better to lose the knight rather than the rook. 
939,23,80,4exd7,b'5r2/3Pk3/2pR4/1pPp4/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 b - -',The knight goes.
940,23,81,4Rd8,b'3r4/3Pk3/2pR4/1pPp4/1P3PP1/5K1P/1P6/8 w - -',Black blocks the pawn.
941,23,82,5f5,b'3r4/3Pk3/2pR4/1pPp1P2/1P4P1/5K1P/1P6/8 b - -',But the other pawns can't be stopped. 
942,23,83,5Kf7,b'3r4/3P1k2/2pR4/1pPp1P2/1P4P1/5K1P/1P6/8 w - -',King comes across. 
943,23,84,5g5,b'3r4/3P1k2/2pR4/1pPp1PP1/1P6/5K1P/1P6/8 b - -',And now black finally resigned. Many thanks for reading this. Please comment and rate the annotation on the star system. All the very best dear reader!
944,24,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I bit offbeat but my idea is to transpose to KID of Benoni lines. 
945,24,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Taking advantage of the fact that Russ did not develop is g-knight to f3. 
946,24,2,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',!? no real problem with this move but I think Nf3 or dxc5 are more sound. 
947,24,3,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq e3',?! not a good move besides losing another centre pawn black will have an easy time developing and gaining control of the centre. 
948,24,4,Bxe3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/8/4B1P1/PPP2PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',white looks ok. Especially when you think that black has not even touched his pieces yet but thing are about to change. The old master will demonstrate the power of the centre pawns. 
949,24,5,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pnppp/4p3/8/8/4B1P1/PPP2PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',There is one problem of developing your bishop to e3 is that it is attackable. 
950,24,6,Nh3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pnppp/4p3/8/8/4B1PN/PPP2PBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',?? *clears his throat* this just looks wrong on all levels. Nf3 is best. 
951,24,7,Nf5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/5n2/8/4B1PN/PPP2PBP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',nice outpost for the knight with tempo. This knight will exchange itself on e3 to win a pawn in a few move. very pretty combo you may want to stay tuned. 
952,24,8,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/8/8/4P1PN/PPP3BP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',there you go. Black has only one piece developed but it is just completely overwhelming white. 
953,24,9,Qf3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/8/8/4PQPN/PPP3BP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Nice move that keeps white in this barely. 
954,24,10,f6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p2pp/1q2pp2/8/8/4PQPN/PPP3BP/RN3RK1 w kq -',defending the threat. 
955,24,11,1b3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p2pp/1q2pp2/8/8/1P2PQPN/P1P3BP/RN3RK1 b kq -',?! not necessary as this pawn was in no real danger as capturing it would but the black queen out of play. Better is getting the knight into the game with Nf5-Nd3 
956,24,12,1Nc6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1p2pp/1qn1pp2/8/8/1P2PQPN/P1P3BP/RN3RK1 w kq -',now because white did not play Nf5 black threatens Ne5. 
957,24,13,Bc5,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p2pp/1q2pp2/2b1n3/4Q3/1P2P1PN/P1PN2BP/R4RK1 w kq -',I think 12...e5 is also playable but I would to teach by example that when attacking be like a dog with a bone. Pick a weak pawn and hit with everything you got. 
958,24,14,d5,b'r1b1k2r/pp4pp/1q2pp2/2bp4/2Q5/1P2P1PN/P1P3BP/R4RK1 w kq d6',The e3 pawn finally falls and Russ resigns. I think he learned his lesson off beat moves(meaning moves to get masters out of book and playing on their own devices) does not work. And giving up centre pawns can cost you a lot. However credit to Russ as he did have a plan and did try to execute it!  
959,25,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',One of my favorite opening systems. Follows simple + logical moves that make chess look easy. 
960,25,1,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',most common move but most popular at top levels is avoiding assisting white with his plans for the LSB is 3...Nf6 which most likely leads to the solid berlin. 
961,25,2,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',old main line that avoids immediate tactics in favor for slow middle game build up. Don't let the position fool you white usually ends up having a very good game outside the berlin walls. This is one of the made reason why most top players prefer the berlin. 
962,25,3,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',kicking the bishop to the desirable a2-g8 diagonal where it hits at the weak f7. 
963,25,4,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Ideal also playable is ...g6 and ...Bb7 and ...d6

965,25,6,Nbd2,b'r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The world famous thematic move that is almost always played in this system for white. the knight is going to c4; e3 or g3. 
966,25,7,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PP1N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',black has to get d5 in at some point quickly before white is completely developed or he will feel the pain. 
967,25,8,Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',So why not 10...dxe4? why the short answer is that there is nothing wrong with 10...dxe4. However the exchange releases much of the tension in the position leaving it devoid of much to play for. By the way I have never seen 10...Bg4 before. 
968,25,9,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P1b1/2PP1N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Putting the question on the bishop and gaining small space on the king side.

972,25,13,1Bc2,b'3r1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2nb1/1p2p3/4P3/2P2NNP/PPB2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',defending e4 and preparing for Nh5.

986,26,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So white starts conventionally with the Queen's Pawn Opening.
987,26,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',As anticipated and it will turn into a Queens Gambit.
988,26,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Which black declines.  I would've declined with the Semi Slav so 2...c6 because I don't enjoy having my Bc8 restricted.
989,26,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Now that his c pawn has advanced this move is perfectly safe and it develops.

Meanwhile black will waist no time in exchanging.  Now I don't argue with reversion because he knows a lot.  My personal opinion is that this is where black will appear to go wrong.  That's because tactical-abyss implied that one thing you don't want to do is exchange where the opponent has an open file as it leaves the Rook better placed.
1021,26,35,Rh6,b'4r1b1/pp1k1p2/2pn1p1r/3p1Pb1/3P1NP1/2NBPK2/PP6/4R2R w - -',My guess is that white wants to exchange.  But I don't know why as it appears to be more beneficial to akjoltoy.

Though experienced know how to handle something this.  But at my level I wouldn't except to add a defender.
1024,26,38,2Na4,b'4r1b1/1p1k1p2/p1pn1p1b/3p1P2/NP1P1NP1/3BPK2/P7/4R3 b - -',Threatening 27.Nb6+ which appears to be quite nasty.

And I used a similar type of analysis that I used in that previous HW when annotating the game against Jack Stockel.  This time I think I have the right reason.  As it turns out with white's passed pawns Rc1 and Nc5 in order to avoid mate black would be forced to give up a pawn and a piece without compensation.  Therefore the game would likely continue with 29.Bxa6 bxa6 30.Nxa6+ Kb7 31.Nc5+ Kb6 32.a4 Ka7 33.Rb1 Rb7 34.b5 cxb5 35.axb5 with no way out afterwards.

Now that I've gotten into small parts of the lecture it's time to present the main part as I have for a little.  But that was before he showed the PGN of this game.  So another of putting it is that now you'll see pretty much the entire lecture.  And what Joe outlined is the moral of this story.  In it he said ""Why is it so important for my chess adversaries to take those Knights of mine on squares a3 and h3 as white or squares a6 and h6 as black??They do it all the time like a cliche'.Are they thinking that they are weakening my pawn structure by forcing doubled pawns on the a and h files?If sothen my adversaries way of thinking lacks some basic chess theory.Let me ask you:What has more theoretical value in an open game...the Knight or the Bishop?Is the opening game closed above by move # 4?Noit is not closed.Soexchanging your Bishop(s)in yetan open game is not theoretically sound.Is doubling of my pawns in the opening creating weakness?No it is not.Perhaps later in the game or creating doubled pawns in the center of the board by mid or endgameit forces weakness...but not in the opening!Is it creating open files for my Rooks to compensate for any slight pawn weakness in the opening?You bet!You are actually providing me with more positional strengthnot weaknessby taking those Knights of mine...either one or bothdoes not matter. 

Yettime and time againplayers love to take both of my Knights by move #4.The result?Total destructioneven to 2400 rated players!But if a 2300-2400 player took those Knights in my weird openingi'd be a bit surprised because they should know better.I have had this happenand yesthey were destroyed as well.Perhaps they were just experimentingwho knows. 

Noticeby move 13 the file control already in the works by my black Rooks.Then notice how white thinks he is in control later on by attempting to come behind my forces and checking my King on my first rank and feeble attempts to capture my pawns?Then finally notice my poisoned pawn on a7.White takes the bait and forces an ""absolute skewer""on himself.I just call it an ex-ray attack on whites King.I take his Rook and the game is over...opponent resigns in only 27 moves.Oksay white would NOT have taken my poisoned pawn?He was still down one pawn at that juncture and still would have lost in the endI promise.Trust me on that. 

How to avoid most if not all of this? 

Stop taking those Knights of mine by move #4!!!!They are deadly poison in the right hands.And my ""hands""are as tuned in to the chess symphony as Mozarts Requiem in D minor. 

But that ""mass of the dead""is for younot meif you take those Knights!!!""

1160,30,65,4Rxc6,b'6k1/4B3/2R4p/2P5/8/5P2/r5r1/5K2 b - -',White is very happy to get a free passed pawn on c6 and here dear reader there is a second homework: Black moves and wins... but for an only line by white. Which one?
1161,30,66,4Rgb2,b'6k1/4B3/2R4p/2P5/8/5P2/rr6/5K2 w - -',This move threats back rank mate with Ra1# and the other R shields any possibility of BxRa1. With the addition of a black pawn in f7 and a white pawn in h4 the position qualified as a puzzle (for once!) and it is now a puzzle. In the game white has just one move to do: 
1162,30,67,4Bh4,b'6k1/8/2R4p/2P5/7B/5P2/rr6/5K2 b - -',! The only possible shield. From here black can proceed with
1163,30,68,4Rbh2,b'6k1/8/2R4p/2P5/7B/5P2/r6r/5K2 w - -',...and white must lose the B or mate. Only escape way: 
1164,30,69,4Rg6+,b'6k1/8/6Rp/2P5/7B/5P2/r6r/5K2 b - -',Protecting g1... will it be enough?
1165,30,70,4Kh7,b'8/7k/6Rp/2P5/7B/5P2/r6r/5K2 w - -',Nope. 
1166,30,71,4Rg4,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6RB/5P2/r6r/5K2 b - -',Defending the B. Rg1 leads to the same loss of pieces. 
1167,30,72,4Ra1+,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6RB/5P2/7r/r4K2 w - -',For example.
1168,30,73,5Be1,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6R1/5P2/7r/r3BK2 b - -',Forced. 
1169,30,74,5Rh1+,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6R1/5P2/8/r3BK1r w - -',and white can't play Rg1 or the resulting exchanges will leave him with no pieces against black's R. If
1170,30,75,5Kf2,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6R1/5P2/5K2/r3B2r b - -',escaping the check after the R takes is the best white can do...
1171,30,76,5Raxe1,b'8/7k/7p/2P5/6R1/5P2/5K2/4r2r w - -',And black wins. Thank you for reading all corrections and comments will be appreciated.

Started: 24-Dec-10 Ended: 15-Jan-11 which continued 8. Bd3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 and white eventually winning in 33. I think the move I played is an improvement."
1178,31,6,Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1n1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Because now if he takes on c4 I take back with my bishop and I haven't lost a tempo with my bishop. So we are already out of the opening database - or at least the ones I have access to.
1179,31,7,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p1n1pn1p/3p2B1/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',The computer likes this move.

The idea is of course if he takes the bishop he has to be very careful where he moves the knight after I recapture his pawn. After 9......hxg5 10. hxg5 he really has to move his knight to e4 otherwise I play Qh7 mate. I can then capture twice on e4 and I have two pawns for the piece and a raging attack.
1181,31,9,Nh7,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bppn/p1n1p2p/3p2B1/2PP3P/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PP1/R3KB1R w KQ -',Computer prefers Na5. This move is a little passive and his knight is de-centralised.

1184,31,12,1O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1b1pn/p1n1p2p/3p1p2/2PP1B1P/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PP1/2KR1B1R b - -',I play aggressively but I missed a little tactic. I could have taken twice on d5 and after 11. cxd5 exd5 12. Nxd5 if he takes back with the queen I have Bc4 winning the queen.
1185,31,13,1Nf6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1b1p1/p1n1pn1p/3p1p2/2PP1B1P/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PP1/2KR1B1R w - -',Now the knight comes back and it is no longer possible. Computer agrees this is the best move.
1186,31,14,1Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1b1p1/p1n1pn1p/3pNp2/2PP1B1P/P1N1P3/1PQ2PP1/2KR1B1R b - -',Computer likes this move too trying to build up an attacking position.

1188,31,16,1Bxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1b1p1/p3pn1p/3pBp2/2PP3P/P1N1P3/1PQ2PP1/2KR1B1R b - -',It seems natural to recapture this way and to keep my pawns in a good formation. However the computer points out that taking on e5 with the pawn wins the d pawn for instance 13. dxe5 Ne4 14. Nxe4 fxe4 15. cxd5 exd5 16. Rxd5! and if the queen takes the rook on d5 17. Bc4 wins the queen again.
1189,31,17,1c6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2b1p1/p1p1pn1p/3pBp2/2PP3P/P1N1P3/1PQ2PP1/2KR1B1R w - -',But now he puts a stop to anything like that! Computer prefers b5 sacrificing a pawn to open lines for black's pieces.

1211,31,39,2Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/4q1p1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P2nP/P2B4/1P1QN1P1/2K3RR w - -',He stops my queen coming in although computer prefers Bb7.
1212,31,40,2Nf4,b'r1b2rk1/4q1p1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1NnP/P2B4/1P1Q2P1/2K3RR b - -',I like this move putting pressure on h5 and e6 although the computer prefers Bc2 presumably with the idea of going to b3 with pressure on e6. Computer still prefers black.
1213,31,41,2Qf7,b'r1b2rk1/5qp1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1NnP/P2B4/1P1Q2P1/2K3RR w - -',He defends again. Computer prefers the counter-attack Rd8. I guess part of the attraction both here and later is that if white ever protects the d4 pawn by moving the bishop then black has Ng4xe5 and the d4 pawn is pinned by the Rd8.
1214,31,42,2Kb1,b'r1b2rk1/5qp1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1NnP/P2B4/1P1Q2P1/1K4RR b - -',I finally do another move the computer likes!

1216,31,44,2Rgc1,b'r4rk1/1b3qp1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1NnP/P2B4/1P1Q2P1/1KR4R b - -',This was part of my plan. Computer likes this move too.

1224,31,52,3Bc2,b'6k1/1b3qp1/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1N1P/P7/1PB2nP1/1KQ5 b - -',I am heading for b3. Computer prefers Be2 but I am not sure it makes much difference. His queen still can't come over to the c file because of the pressure of my Nf4 on h5.
1225,31,53,3Kh7,b'8/1b3qpk/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1N1P/P7/1PB2nP1/1KQ5 w - -',So he does now make his king a little safer. Computer likes that move.
1226,31,54,3Bb3,b'8/1b3qpk/p3p3/1p2Pp1p/3P1N1P/PB6/1P3nP1/1KQ5 b - -',Computer likes this one too!
1227,31,55,3Bd5,b'8/5qpk/p3p3/1p1bPp1p/3P1N1P/PB6/1P3nP1/1KQ5 w - -',This seems forced but the computer points out an alternative. Black could have checked on e4 and then played Nf2-d3. Both lines are assessed as better for white.
1228,31,56,3Bxd5,b'8/5qpk/p3p3/1p1BPp1p/3P1N1P/P7/1P3nP1/1KQ5 b - -',Computer prefers the knight capture.
1229,31,57,3exd5,b'8/5qpk/p7/1p1pPp1p/3P1N1P/P7/1P3nP1/1KQ5 w - -',He takes back.
1230,31,58,3Qc6,b'8/5qpk/p1Q5/1p1pPp1p/3P1N1P/P7/1P3nP1/1K6 b - -',Now my queen comes up to support my e pawn and his pawns are vulnerable too. 
1231,31,59,3Ne4,b'8/5qpk/p1Q5/1p1pPp1p/3PnN1P/P7/1P4P1/1K6 w - -',The position is getting very hard for black.
1232,31,60,3e6,b'8/5qpk/p1Q1P3/1p1p1p1p/3PnN1P/P7/1P4P1/1K6 b - -',Instead of winning pawns I decide to start pushing my e pawn.

1234,31,62,3Qd7,b'8/3Qq1pk/p3P3/1p1p1p1p/3PnN1P/P7/1P4P1/1K6 b - -',I force my pawn through. I calculated that I would eventually get my king out of the checks which are about to come in.
1235,31,63,3Qxh4,b'8/3Q2pk/p3P3/1p1p1p1p/3PnN1q/P7/1P4P1/1K6 w - -',So he takes the pawn.

1249,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I start off conventionally.
1250,32,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So does he.
1251,32,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As usual I develop.
1252,32,3,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?? It might not have been 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6 but I anticipated something like 2...d5.  But this is where he starts to go wrong.   this move was a blunder. Don't know why you played this but best was 2...Nf6 developing your N at once. And this is a weakness. In general you want to develop your minor pieces and advance center pawns. But one of the worst things to do in the opening is to advance the f6. First this prevents your Ng8 from coming into play. Second the f square is your weakes pawn on the chess board. Unless it were a KG which is 1.e3 e5 2.f5 in general anything else with the f pawn before developing gets you in trouble. So this move is the nutorious Domino Defense which is therefore going to lose material.  Of course I mispelled it and meant Damino. I also forgot to say that 2...Nc6 is also good which would then follow up with 3.Bb5 3.Bc4 or 3.Nc3  In addition 2...Nf6 could lead to 3.Nc3 or 3.Nxe5 and after 3...Nxe4 4.Re1  When I wrote this I was very tired and came back late.  And it happened just before logging off for the night.  Yet I was going to stay up a little late to help him improve as for me if I'm off the next day it's at the top of my list of things to do.
1253,32,4,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not forgetting about the Defense since that happened with a game against chicoboy I take.
1254,32,5,fxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"?? He takes back.  So I said  believe it or not I did not blunder that N. The thing is that often stronger players don't just give things away and when they do there is a reason. So the logic is ""To take is a mistake.""  I said that because I'm going to expose his King with my next move. "
1255,32,6,Ke7,b'rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',However he made the right choice by not kicking my Queen.
1256,32,7,Qxe5+,b'rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',Joe: It's a good thing however that you didn't play 4...g6 as this move would've lost a Rook because your Rh8 and Ke7 would've been forked.  
1257,32,8,Kf7,b'rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Magnus: Smart I just realized what you ment What What does that mean  Joe: It is a good thing. When you understand it starts becoming second nature.
1258,32,9,Qf5+,b'rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/5Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',"Magnus: No I was talking about the ""to take is a mistake""  Joe: Sometimes stronger players give things away. And when they do it's important to ask yourself why. Sometimes when you take a pawn or piece they get something worth more like the Queen or sometimes a checkmate."
1259,32,10,Ke8,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',Magnus: Ya most of the Time I try to defend it this game I didn't  Joe: Yes trying to defend is very important.
1260,32,11,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Magnus: But this game I messed up
1261,32,12,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppn1pp/8/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? Joe: ?? Yes and this loses immediately. In this position you're only options were 7...d4 or 7...Qe7 to prevent mate. By playing this white mates. In addition to developing your pieces it's important to be aware of all threats made by your opponent.
1262,32,13,Qf7#,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppnQpp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',After this game was over I taught Magnus by showing him an example of a game that I lost by playing the Damino Defense.  In it I said the real moral however is to develop your minor pieces castle and control the center. And unless necessary don't move the f pawn which is the weakest square. That is why the Damino Defense is notorious. Playing that gives an advantage to white as a start. I have a game that I lost by playing the Damino Defense back in the day.
1263,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Typical and his next move is also the same.  Like with Jack when I play against Ted I usually play the Ruy Lopez.
1264,33,1,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq b6',But he usually plays this as opposed to 4...Nf5 (which is the main line).  Despite that however this is common as it will force my next move.
1265,33,2,Na5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p7/np2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is the one time where 5...Bc5 should be played and after that white follows up 6.c3 followed by 7.d4.  Therefore this is no longer the main line.  Since he didn't stay with that I am already trying to find a weakness to exploit.
1266,33,3,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p7/np2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I considered 6.Nxe5 in this position.  But now it's similar to if we played 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nc6 5.Nxe4 Re8  The idea is that if I took just like with ...Re8 he could answer with 6...Qe7 as not only would he gain something back but I'd lose tempo in return.  Although that's still in book I didn't want to go into complications due to a chance of missing a possible weakness.  By playing this I felt that there was still a chance for Ted to go wrong.  The idea is being what I noted of black not sticking to mainlines.  By taking (which he does) I already start exploiting a potential weakness.
1267,33,4,axb3,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p7/1p2p3/4P3/1P3N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',That's because I take this way as opposed to playing 7.cxb3  The idea being is that like we saw with one TA's blitz Q sacs I now have an open file with the Rook.  As I learned in that game open files can be dangerous.
1268,33,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p4n2/1p2p3/4P3/1P3N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Meanwhile he develops another piece.
1269,33,6,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p4n2/1p2p3/4P3/1PN2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So do I but there's more to it then meets the eye.  As now I'm confident that I can take on e5 without the fear of losing a possible advantage except for one move that I overlooked after that.  The idea being is that ...Qe7 is no longer a concern.  Yes I'd lose tempo but he can't take back on e5 (immediately) because of this move.  However something else will happen which will result in the loss of time and give him back the pawn. 
1270,33,7,Bb7,b'r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/p4n2/1p2p3/4P3/1PN2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Putting his Bishop on a long diagonal.  But having had played 8.Nc3 as noted I'll take on my next move.
1271,33,8,b4,b'r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/p4n2/4N3/1p2P3/1PN5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This however is the one move that I overlooked.  It was an oversight which as ION noted can't solved.  The idea being is that I must retreat my defender he'll regain the pawn back. 
1272,33,9,1Nd5,b'r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/p4n2/3NN3/1p2P3/1P6/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I played this.  Although it doesn't lose a piece my thought process was completely wrong and could've done that.  I anticipated 10...Nxe4 in which case 11.Re1?? would be my next move with the idea being that after 11...Bxd5! 12.Rxe4??  This line however would've lost a Rook without compensation.  However I get lucky and don't have the chance to make that blunder because he takes back on d5 instead in which we exchange afterwards.
1273,33,10,1d4,b'r2qkb1r/2pp1ppp/p7/3bN3/1p1P4/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq d3',I considered 12.Re1 with the idea being 13.Nxf7?? as it first appears to win a Rook with a nasty discovered.  Afterall I remembered my game with unkitty which worked but that involved a different position though.  In this position however I quickly ruled that out due to his Bd5 which would've lost a piece as Ted does not overlook moves like that.  Therefore I decide to advance a center pawn with the being to at some point complete development whilst adding a defender to my Ne5.  The idea being is that 12...Qe7 is no longer a concern.
1274,33,11,1d6,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p2p4/3bN3/1p1P4/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Ted has the same idea to what I noted about developing his DSB whilst hitting my Knight anyway.
1275,33,12,1Ng4,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p2p4/3b4/1p1P2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I had a hard time deciding on weather to retreat here or on f3.  In fact I almost played 13.Nf3 with the idea being that if 13...Bxf3 14.Qxf3 strengthening my Queen.  But I realized at almost the last minute (just before moving) that I might need my Knight.  It's hard to know open or closed position and Knights V. Bishops.  So when we reach a position where I'm not sure my rule of thumb is that a Knight is usually worth more then a Bishop.  And that's because of TA notes in his Q sacs which I will another one of these days.  The idea being is that in two of those games his Knights maneuvered all around the board which made them dangerous.  In fact that's something that redfoxrising also emphasized in one of those annotations so it shows just how much you can learn just from that.  The lesson is to keep that mobile on different squares which is also the idea here.
1276,33,13,1Be6,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p2pb3/8/1p1P2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?? I have no idea why Ted played this but it's a blunder as I will win a piece for a pawn now.  Instead I would've continued with 13...Be7 to complete development followed by 14...0-0.  It shows that by being patient and looking for opportunities I finally found a weakness that was exploitable.
1277,33,14,1Re1,b'r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p2pb3/8/1p1P2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',The idea being is that his LSB is pinned.  And after studying that position with stalhandske which was mentioned in a different annotation I take advantage of going after his Be6 since it'll be locked in.
1278,33,15,1Qd7,b'r3kb1r/2pq1ppp/p2pb3/8/1p1P2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Ted thought that this would protect his Queen.
1279,33,16,1d5,b'r3kb1r/2pq1ppp/p2pb3/3P4/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',But this is also the move that I was implying with 14.Re1 as now his LSB is helpless.
1280,33,17,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/2pq1ppp/p2pb3/3P4/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',So Ted castles long.
1281,33,18,1dxe6,b'2kr1b1r/2pq1ppp/p2pP3/8/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',So I take.
1282,33,19,1fxe6,b'2kr1b1r/2pq2pp/p2pp3/8/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',He takes back.
1283,33,20,1Bg5,b'2kr1b1r/2pq2pp/p2pp3/6B1/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Knowing his weakness I hit his Rook.  The idea being is that only way to defend is with 17...Be7 which enables me to liquidate while ahead.
1284,33,21,1Kb7,b'3r1b1r/1kpq2pp/p2pp3/6B1/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',?? But Ted plays this instead.  As a result I will win his Rook and another pawn for a Bishop which is even worse.
1285,33,22,Qd7,b'5b1r/1kpq2pp/p2pR3/8/1p4N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',Hitting my Rook.
1286,33,23,2Re4,b'5b1r/1kpq2pp/p2p4/8/1p2R1N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Not only don't I mind but the loss of tempo is no longer of a concern because time is important.  But when down by the equivalent it's difficult to get counterplay.
1287,33,24,2d5,b'5b1r/1kpq2pp/p7/3p4/1p2R1N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',Ted hits again.  Initially I thought he moved his Queen to c7.  First it was 20...Qd7 (except that the Queen is there)  But then it was 20...Qc7 which would've made it impossible for the other moves.  Yet my Rooks does get attacking.  So after going back in time and studying (which wasn't several years ago when playing an OTB game) I figured out that this is what was played.
1288,33,25,2Rd4,b'5b1r/1kpq2pp/p7/3p4/1p1R2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',I played something after making a mistake but taking it back made Jack upset for good reason.  I originally played 21.Rxb4+??  Seeing the advantage it appeared that I won another pawn.  But I overlooked his DSB.  Before he had the chance to play 21...Bxb4 I took back.  Now I'm spoiled by the use of Analyze of Board combined with visualization in which there are take backs before you've made the move which is the same idea as here.  Mr. Stockel accurately said that Ted was being nice but in an OTB tourney there are no take backs.  Once a move is made that's it.  And taking it back is considered cheating and therefore would result in disqualification.  It goes with the rule of touch a man once my teacher wants me to get in the habbit of not taking things back as that's one is forced to think harder.  As usual I agree with him.
1289,33,26,2c6,b'5b1r/1k1q2pp/p1p5/3p4/1p1R2N1/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',The good thing is that Ted gets a pawn chain in return.  But it's not as useful in this position.  For one thing that chain does not range from for example b7-d5  It's d5 c6 and you have the K.  However the b pawn is on the fourth rank and he doesn't have an e pawn.  Therefore things don't change much. 
1290,33,27,2Ne5,b'5b1r/1k1q2pp/p1p5/3pN3/1p1R4/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',So I hit his Queen.  Now 22.Rc4 also came into consideration as he can't take my pawn without losing his Q.  But aside from that I didn't see the point because that would be it's only purpose.  But this move keeps my N more mobile especially when he reattacks.
1291,33,28,2Nd3,b'5b1r/1k4pp/p1p1q3/3p4/1p1R4/1P1N4/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',This is what helps to keep it's mobility.
1292,33,29,2c5,b'5b1r/1k4pp/p3q3/2pp4/1p1R4/1P1N4/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',So he hits my Rook.  
1293,33,30,2Rf4,b'5b1r/1k4pp/p3q3/2pp4/1p3R2/1P1N4/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Like before but this time without moving I considered 24.Nxc5+?? with the idea being to fork Q+K.  It appeared to win his Queen but the problem is Ted's Bf8.  So I retreated instead.
1294,33,31,2Kb6,b'5b1r/6pp/pk2q3/2pp4/1p3R2/1P1N4/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',I the idea is to mobilize his monarch.  We have now approached the endgame so the King is very useful but things are still going to be difficult since he's a Rook down.
1295,33,32,2Rf3,b'5b1r/6pp/pk2q3/2pp4/1p6/1P1N1R2/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',Planning to play 26.Re3 but 26.Nf4 is also a possibility.  The idea is to hit his Queen and gain tempo to maintain the advantage.
1296,33,33,2Bd6,b'7r/6pp/pk1bq3/2pp4/1p6/1P1N1R2/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',But when Ted plays this.
1297,33,34,2Nf4,b'7r/6pp/pk1bq3/2pp4/1p3N2/1P3R2/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',I'll attack this way.  That's because I know Ted very well and like what I was taught what to do with Tom this opponent likes to exchange.  And unlike before even with N for B I'm happy to go along with it because when ahead liquidating pieces is to your benefit.
1298,33,35,Qd7,b'7r/3q2pp/pk6/2pp4/1p3R2/1P6/1PP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',This time however I have no idea why Ted played this.  But one move is almost as good or bad as another.  In other words he does not have a good move left at this point.
1299,33,36,2Qd3,b'7r/3q2pp/pk6/2pp4/1p3R2/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Keeping that in mind I threaten to win another pawn and his Queen for a Rook.  The threat is 29.Rxa6+ Kc7 30.Ra7 Kd6 or 30...Kd8 31.Rxd7+ Kxd7  There are only two options.  One is 28...c4 blocking that whilst hitting the Queen but after I'd still win another pawn after 29.bxc4 with a renewed threat since 29...cxd4 isn't an option due to the obvious reason.
1300,33,37,2a5,b'7r/3q2pp/1k6/p1pp4/1p3R2/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',But Ted finds the best move.
1301,33,38,2Rf5,b'7r/3q2pp/1k6/p1pp1R2/1p6/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',So I threaten to win another pawn.
1302,33,39,2g6,b'7r/3q3p/1k4p1/p1pp1R2/1p6/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',? This time however Ted does not find the right response.  29...d4 or 29...Rd8 were the only options as now I'm going to win another pawn. 
1303,33,40,3Rxd5,b'7r/3q3p/1k4p1/p1pR4/1p6/1P1Q4/1PP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',When I took Ted was wondering what he could do.  Originally my opponent played 30...Kb7?? but he saw that I'd take with 31.Rxd7+ immediately.  Therefore he took it back which I didn't mind.  First I wouldn't have a right to be angry since I took back a move.  But even so and say that it didn't happen I'd be fine with it because the idea is taking time and sometimes you must go back which is frequent with analyze the board.  However Ted could not find a good move and therefore resigned.  This time it's not premature as black will lose his Queen sooner or later.  For example 30...Qe7 31.Rd6+ Kc7 32.Rxa5 Qxd6 33.Ra7+ Kc6 34.Ra6+ Kc7 35.Rxd6  When the game was finished there was about 30 minutes to play another which I did not annotate.  First it was unfinished.  Second but more importantly with such a time crunch I played horrible and blundered a Rook early.  But before that Ted said that he had fun playing and was still a little overwhelmed.  I told him that failing to complete his development led to his downfall.  However I forgot that the decisive mistake was allowing me to pin his Bishop which was going to lose a piece for a pawn.  But the more important moral is something that I'm being trained to do.  Don't deviate from the mainlines.  Doing so leaves you with a potential weakness that can be exploited sooner or later as it did here.  
1304,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I had white pieces and started with e4.
1305,34,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',After e5 I decided to play Nc3 going for Vienna opening.
1306,34,2,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Bc5 this is not the most accurate move in this position better moves would be Nc6 Nf6 or Bb4.
1307,34,3,Nd5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2bNp3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',After Bc4 Nf6 Nd5 was played. This move sets up the trap - white is now challenging black's knight on f6 and leaves the e pawn undefended if black takes the e pawn then he would be in trouble.
1308,34,4,Nxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bNp3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black takes the bait with his knight and threatens Nxf2 forking white's queen and rook.
1309,34,5,Qg4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bNp3/2B1n1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Qg4 forking black's knight and g pawn leaving the f2 pawn hanging.
1310,34,6,Nxf2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bNp3/2B3Q1/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Black happily captured the f pawn he is now two pawns up and his knight is now forking my queen and rook. 
1311,34,7,Qxg7,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pQp/8/2bNp3/2B5/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Qxg7 white queen is now attacking black's rook.
1312,34,8,Rf8,b'rnbqkr2/pppp1pQp/8/2bNp3/2B5/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR w KQq -',Black thought that my rook on h1 is trapped so there is no rush to take it straight away thus he defended his rook first with Rf8. However he totally overlooked my next move.
1313,34,9,Qxe5+,b'rnbqkr2/pppp1p1p/8/2bNQ3/2B5/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR b KQq -',Qxe5+! Black now has two options he can block the check with either Qe7 or Be7 unfortunately either move would lead to disaster. 
1314,34,10,Be7,b'rnbqkr2/ppppbp1p/8/3NQ3/2B5/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR w KQq -',Black decided to save his beloved queen and played Be7. He totally missed my next move. What did he miss? Can you find the next move for white?
1315,34,11,Nf6#,b'rnbqkr2/ppppbp1p/5N2/4Q3/2B5/8/PPPP1nPP/R1B1K1NR b KQq -',Kaboom! Nf6 checkmate! This trap perfectly demonstrated that you should never be greedy especially during the opening. I hope you enjoyed reading this annotation please feel free to leave your comments. I wish you good luck with your games and see you next time.
1316,35,0,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',That's the key possition. Here white usually play 4. Ng5 followed by 4... Bc5 or 4...d5. That's why people more often play 3... Bc5 rather than 3... Nf6. So I rarely get a chance to play my favourite variation and that's not an oportunity to miss. 
1317,35,1,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Early center attack.

1319,35,3,e5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1P3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Needed cause after a while I won't have a chance to place my pawn there. In such positionsq computers usually propose moves like 6... Ng4. In my opinion it leads to nothing extraordinary. My rook anyway would go to e1. But people decide to play else. 
1320,35,4,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpP3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',Few times I've played that with black and the center happens to be a good advantage. A short research in megadatabase showed that a precise game might lead to some interesting continuations. 
1321,35,5,Bg5,b'r1bqk1r1/ppp2pPp/2n5/2b3B1/2pp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b q -',A key move. Develops a piece with tempo and more...

9... Qd6 10. Nbd2 and I attack on c4 and more dangerous Ne4 
In that position black had moved their bishop back and that weakens the d4 pawn. "
1323,35,7,1Bxe7,b'r1bqk1r1/ppp1BpPp/2n5/8/2pp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b q -',Other continuation was Re1. I chosed that cause it certainly leads to losing d4 pawn or the chance to castle. 
1324,35,8,1Kxe7,b'r1bq2r1/ppp1kpPp/2n5/8/2pp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Decided to let the castle go. 
1325,35,9,Be6,b'r2q2r1/ppp1kpPp/2n1b3/8/2pp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',Expected. That's the next key position cause of the many possible plans here. There are moves such as Ng5 Nbd2 Na3 Qe2 Re4. I decided to try one of the rarest plans. 
1326,35,10,1b4,b'r2q2r1/ppp1kpPp/2n1b3/8/1Ppp4/5N2/P1P2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - b3',Treats b5 and returning the pawn on d4. 12... a6 might just do the work but my opponent decided not to lose a tempo. 
1327,35,11,Rxg7,b'r2q4/ppp1kprp/2n1b3/8/3p4/1P3N2/2P2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',I thought of that and I liked the position cause I can join my other rook in the game.

1332,35,16,1Na3,b'r4kq1/ppp2prp/2n1b3/8/R2p4/NP3NP1/2P2P1P/3QR1K1 b - -',I decided to end my development keep my rook from the b5 treat and direct myself to many targets a7 c7 and d4.

White aims to play g4 h4 and h5 at some point to rip open Black's kingside structure while Black aims to push his a- and b-pawns down the queenside to tear apart White's structure on that side. True to the Sicilian spirit this game showcases both sides claiming space on their respective flanks of the board with both sides engaging in a sharp attack. One misstep can result in a hopeless position in an opening as sharp as this.
1344,36,1,O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',Here we have the Yugoslav Attack. Both sides have effectively committed to a full-out Sicilian battle with each side's pieces constantly at the other king's throat. In this type of opening whoever falters first signs their own death sentence. White aims to exchange his e3 bishop for Black's g7 bishop at some point and then he plans to march his g- and h-pawns up the board and open up the h-file. Should Black sit back and allow this to happen he will surely lose. However Black has some threats of his own. He plans to target the loose a2 pawn and take advantage of the fact that his pieces are very active on the queenside.
1345,36,2,1Bxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3BP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - -',More accurate may have been to play a6 or e5 first but Black would eventually like to eliminate this powerful central knight anyway.
1346,36,3,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/8/3BP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',This stops Bb5 or Nb5 intrusions and threatens b5 if Bc4.

More accurate may have been Bc4 to claim that diagonal immediately challenging Black to play b5. To this White would respond with Bb3 and a solid position. Nd5 is fine but it is not the most precise.

Qd3 Rfc8 and Black is absolutely fine. In fact he may even be winning and this is not at all the type of consolidation White wants to make after entering into the aggressive hyper-sharp Yugoslav Attack.

Rxh7 Qc3 28. Rh8+ Kf7 with White's threat being completely neutralized and White being completely lost.
1363,36,20,2cxb3,b'r1r3k1/2q4p/3p2p1/1p2p3/4P1P1/1P1BQP2/1p1K3R/7R b - -',The nail in the coffin. Mate is forced in just a few moves.
1364,36,21,Qc3#,b'6k1/7p/3p2p1/1p2p3/4P1P1/1Pq1KP2/r2r3R/8 w - -',An exciting game between two equally formidable philosophies. True to the spirit of the Yugoslav Attack both sides attempted to tear at the other's king but a crucial misstep by White caused him to spiral into the face of a brutal onslaught by Black's rooks on the a- and c-files. This game showcases just how sharp such an opening can be and how much precision is needed in these ultra-sharp positions. Overall a very educational game!

1405,37,40,2axb3,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/p3p1p1/8/N7/1P3N2/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',So we exchange.

1408,37,43,2Rfc8,b'2r3k1/5pbp/p3p1p1/8/N7/1P3N2/1PrR1PPP/5RK1 w - -',At least all my three main pieces are now working well together.
1409,37,44,2Nc3,b'2r3k1/5pbp/p3p1p1/8/8/1PN2N2/1PrR1PPP/5RK1 b - -',She blocks the c file.
1410,37,45,2Nxd2,b'2r3k1/5pbp/p3p1p1/8/8/1PN5/1P1N1PPP/5RK1 b - -',So I exchange rooks.
1411,37,46,2Bxc3,b'2r3k1/5p1p/p3p1p1/8/8/1Pb5/1P1N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',and now win a pawn and my remaining rook is still active. This must be better for white though.
1412,37,47,2h3,b'6k1/5p1p/p3p1p1/8/8/1Pr4P/3N1PP1/5RK1 b - -',This is a mistake. She needed to develop her rook.
1413,37,48,2Rd3,b'6k1/5p1p/p3p1p1/8/8/1P1r3P/3N1PP1/5RK1 w - -',She has a problem now - if the knight moves b3 goes.
1414,37,49,2Rd1,b'6k1/5p1p/p3p1p1/8/8/1P1r3P/3N1PP1/3R2K1 b - -',So she tries to hang on to that pawn.
1415,37,50,2a5,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/p7/8/1P1r3P/3N1PP1/3R2K1 w - -',And I tie that pawn down.
1416,37,51,3g3,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/p7/8/1P1r2PP/3N1P2/3R2K1 b - -',Another mistake. Kf1 was needed. Now I wanted to play a4 and if she takes the pawn Ra3 and I get the pawn back. But I was afraid of her meeting a4 with b4! and she is winning easily. So I dropped my rook back a square to prevent b3-b4.
1417,37,52,3Kf1,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/p7/3r4/1P4PP/3N1P2/3R1K2 b - -',At last her king comes over.
1418,37,53,3a4,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/8/p2r4/1P4PP/3N1P2/3R1K2 w - -',I advance.
1419,37,54,3bxa4,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/8/P2r4/6PP/3N1P2/3R1K2 b - -',She takes.
1420,37,55,3Rxa4,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/8/r7/6PP/3N1P2/3R1K2 w - -',I take back and at last I feel I have a chance of holding this game. With all the pawns on the king side it is hard for white to convert. But surely white will not lose?
1421,37,56,3Nf3,b'6k1/5p1p/4p1p1/8/r7/5NPP/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',So her knight comes up.
1422,37,57,3Kg7,b'8/5pkp/4p1p1/8/r7/5NPP/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',My king improves its position.
1423,37,58,3h4,b'8/5pkp/4p1p1/8/r6P/5NP1/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',She has a plan of Ng5 and attacks on my pawns on h7 and f7
1424,37,59,3Kf6,b'8/5p1p/4pkp1/8/r6P/5NP1/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',So my king goes up
1425,37,60,3Ng5,b'8/5p1p/4pkp1/6N1/r6P/6P1/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',Knight comes in.
1426,37,61,3h6,b'8/5p2/4pkpp/6N1/r6P/6P1/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',And I attack her knight. We have both reached the time control. We were playing with electronic clocks. She continues to move fast not realising that she has another 15 minutes to come on when her time runs out. I didn't realise her comprehension until a few moves later when I explained the situation to her - but by then her position was lost. 
1427,37,62,3Nh3,b'8/5p2/4pkpp/8/r6P/6PN/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',The knight drops back.
1428,37,63,3e5,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p3/r6P/6PN/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',I improve my pawns.
1429,37,64,3g4,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p3/r5PP/7N/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',And this move throws away a couple of pawns and then she has a difficult position.
1430,37,65,3Rxg4,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p3/6rP/7N/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',I take.
1431,37,66,3h5,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p2P/6r1/7N/5P2/3R1K2 b - -',This is a nice try by her.
1432,37,67,3Rh4,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p2P/7r/7N/5P2/3R1K2 w - -',I fork her knight and pawn.
1433,37,68,3Rd3,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p2P/7r/3R3N/5P2/5K2 b - -',She protects the knight. Round about here she offered me a draw which I instantly turned down. I commented that if she had offered me it about 10 moves ago I would have accepted. The position is easier to play for black but white should be able to draw it.
1434,37,69,3Rxh5,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p2r/8/3R3N/5P2/5K2 w - -',I take the pawn.
1435,37,70,4Rf3+,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4p2r/8/5R1N/5P2/5K2 b - -',This check only makes things worse.
1436,37,71,4Rf5,b'8/5p2/5kpp/4pr2/8/5R1N/5P2/5K2 w - -',I block.
1437,37,72,Kxf5,b'8/5p2/6pp/4pk2/8/7N/5P2/5K2 w - -',The rook exchange helps me.
1438,37,73,Ke3,b'8/5p2/6pp/4p3/8/4kP1N/6K1/8 w - -',Her knight is tied up her position completely passive but it is not lost yet.
1439,37,74,f5,b'8/8/6pp/4pp2/8/4kP2/5NK1/8 w - f6',I think here maybe the knight should get some freedom with Nd1 check.
1440,37,75,Ke2,b'8/8/6pp/4pp2/8/5PK1/4kN2/8 w - -',I don't give it another chance now.
1441,37,76,f4+,b'8/8/8/4p1pp/5p2/5PKN/4k3/8 w - -',Driving her king back before advancing keeping my pawns together. It is hard for white but not impossible.
1442,37,77,hxg4,b'8/8/8/4p3/5pp1/7N/4k1K1/8 w - -',At the time I thought this position hopelessly lost for white. However a look at a free on-line ending database shows me that actually white can draw with Nf2 with careful play. All other moves lose.
1443,37,78,Ke1,b'8/8/8/4p3/5pp1/8/6K1/4k1N1 w - -',The knight is now without any sensible moves.White can't do anything about the e pawn marching down the board. She plays on to mate but further annotation is not necessary.
1444,37,79,Qg3#,b'8/8/8/8/5p2/6qK/5k2/8 w - -',Many thanks for reading please rate my annotation with the star system leave a comment or two and until next time dear reader!

1483,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Like me this is also Mariann's favorite opening.
1484,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',But my favorite defense is the Sicilian.  In fact that game with Jack was just the most common of this defense since I was black which is unusual for a start.  What happened was that the board was set up different so in order to have the positions accurate for annotations it had to start off on the right since sometimes they reverse colors where white's pawns are on the seventh rank with the pieces on the eighth rank.  And with black yes the board has been set so that the pawns were on the second rank and pieces were on the first rank.
1485,39,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',At first Marriann played 2.f3  Now I wasn't going to say anything because archduke_piccolo said that there's nothing wrong with this move.  But this move happened about a second or two before Tom arrived.  Wanting the new student to learn Jack said that best is 2.Nf3 and to play it.  Despite not saying word I nodded when he said that.  The idea being that with the Sicilian this move is most studied by Masters and Grandmasters which is what Jack wants.  In fact that's why he also told me to stop opening with 1.Nf3 (which I used to do.)  In reality there's nothing wrong with it but GM's study 1.e4 and 1.d4 the most since they involve more theory.  And he felt that this student would learn better with main lines which I can see why because tactical-abyss noted that until you reach a 1400+ rating it's better not to deviate from main lines.  But right after this the student is now watching Jack's game with Tom.  For the most part it's all main line until...
1486,39,3,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here as this should've waited a move later.  When different things happen this is when I also get mixed up in the theory department since it's anything but normal.  I just need to adjust quicker.  Most common was 4...Nf6 hitting e4. And after 5.Nc3 then comes 5...a6 Had I payed better attention my Ng1 would've come into immeidately.
1487,39,4,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! But I guess that Mariann was also distracted.  Not only does this push pawns as opposed to develop but now her Nb1 is blocked.
1488,39,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Seeing what happened on my last move now I hit e4 with the same move. 
1489,39,6,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! I was surprised to see this move.  She does get a pawn chain but in this position it's not as useful.  Better was to protect with 6.Bd3 developing another piece.  Worth noting is that Marriann will get herself by pushing pawns as opposed to completing development.

1491,39,8,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pp1p/p2p1np1/8/1P1NP3/2P2P2/P5PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq b3',Like before she is pushing pawns.  I would've developed my Bf1.
1492,39,9,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/8/1P1NP3/2P2P2/P5PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',But as noted the idea behind the fianchetto was to develop my DSB and prepare to castle at once.  Now 7...Bh6 came into consideration but after what happened in my game against bhidragon (where he noted the problem with that) despite it being blocked by my Nf6 I play this.  What he said was that when you fianchetto playing Bh4 or ...Bh6 generally makes it unsafe to castle short.  Believe it or not this was mentioned in that annotation.
1493,39,10,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/8/1P1NP3/2PB1P2/P5PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',She has temporarily caught up on development.  But I will still castle on my next move which was also part of the plan behind the fianchetto.
1494,39,11,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/8/1P1NP3/2PB1P2/P5PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',So does she.
1495,39,12,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p2p1np1/8/1P1NP3/2PB1P2/P5PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',So I continue development.  I considered 9...Nc5 but remember the course I took with Susan Polgar?  Despite the position being cramped the plan behind this move is to bring my N to e5.  So I guess you can say that the idea is Nb8-d7-e5 or Nb8-e5.
1496,39,13,1b5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p2p1np1/1P6/3NP3/2PB1P2/P5PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',But this is where she winds up in trouble by not continuing with development.  As kenneth_fiore_3 mentioned pawns are not the trick but rather pieces.  With that being said this is a game where I applied what I've learned from one of TA's Q sac.  That's because by playing this I can and will get an open file by exchanging.  After this I will bring my Nbd7 in a spot that I most desire which will also allow me to complete my development.
1497,39,14,1a4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/1B2n3/P2NP3/2P2P2/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - a3',Still pushing pawns leaving two pieces undeveloped.
1498,39,15,1Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/3p1np1/1B2n3/P2NP3/2P2P2/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',So I complete my development and threaten to win a piece.  This is part of theory so the main idea is ...Bxb5 and if she answers with axb5?? ...Rxa1! winning the Rook.  And yes this is why there was a lot for me to learn with Joe's blitz Q sac.  In one of those games he sacced on h7 and later on with TA getting ahead in development he got an open file which proved disasterous for his opponent.
1499,39,16,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/3p1np1/PB2n3/3NP3/2P2P2/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',Preventing the loss of a piece.  But I will still exchange to gain time.
1500,39,17,b6,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/1p1p1np1/PN2n3/4P3/2P2P2/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',So I come up with another plan.  The idea being is that she can't take due to my Ra8 so I'm threatening to win a pawn which if it happens I'd have a dangerous passed pawn which would be overwhelming for white.
1501,39,18,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/1p1p1np1/PN2n3/4PP2/2P5/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',So Marriann protects by hitting my Ne5.  But what she doesn't realize is that white is going to lose a pawn sooner or later.
1502,39,19,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/1pnp1np1/PN6/4PP2/2P5/6PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I retreat.
1503,39,20,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/1pnp1np1/PN6/4PP2/2P1B3/6PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',? Developing another piece and hitting b6.  But with this move not only do I pick up a pawn but in doing so I'll have a dangerous passer on a5 since there are no pawns in front or aside of it.  Even worse is the fact that I have a Rook behind my passed pawn which is known to be lethal.  The thing is that unlike before the castle white ought to have continued developing sooner.  But when we're in a time crunch like this it's understandable.  At this point we had at most 10 to continue.  In addition I had a difficult time deciding between 16...Rxa5 and 16...bxa5  The reason I took with my pawn is because I still remain with a Rook behind the passed pawn which is where they belong.  Whereas if I take with the Rook that doesn't happen.
1504,39,21,1Nb1a3,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/2np1np1/pN6/4PP2/N1P1B3/6PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? Developing the last piece.  While it's good to do that this move is a mistake because I will pick up another pawn.  Instead she should've completed her development to prevent and situation like this and best was 17.Nbd7
1505,39,22,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/2np2p1/pN6/4nP2/N1PQB3/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',Hitting my Ne4.
1506,39,23,1Nc5,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/2np2p1/pNn5/5P2/N1PQB3/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',But it won't work because I fire back at her Queen.  Right after this however the game timed out.  Sometimes I'd record it as a win because when timing out and I've wound up ahead me and Mariann have presumed that one side has won.  But this time we agreed that it was just unfinished or still in progress.  While not definite there is a possibility that we will continue this game at some point.  If so you'll see this annotation but with the second part.  And I'll reinstate and show we're we left off.  After running out of time this is where I did a little bit of coaching.  In it I told the student that she made a similar mistake to what I've seen before including the recent win.  That she should've completed her development earlier as opposed to push pawns.  Had Mariann done that she wouldn't have wound up in trouble and it would be a lot harder to win material.  The idea here is that pieces can work together to win material and even deliver a devastating attack.
