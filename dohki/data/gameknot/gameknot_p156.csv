Could sayt also that in case the attack does not conclude on d column I have a new perspective on c-column... but black has counter-game in that case.

the computer suggests this is a mistake (without jeopardize the victory though) and prefer the direct attack on the rooks by Bc5"

321,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1.e4 - The game starts with a very uncommon move by white.
322,12,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black is confused and decides to copy whites move.
323,12,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White puts a quick end to blacks hopes of copying evey move and plays 2.d4 preventing the symmetric response because in case black would play d5 now white can simply take the pawn on e5 pinning black´s d5 pawn to black´s queen.
324,12,3,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So black simply decided to take the pawn here...
325,12,4,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',But he missed that white had the simple still genious move Qxd4. In that way white succeded in tying down black´s bishop to the defense of his g7-pawn black´s rook to the denfense of the a7-pawn and black´s bishop queen and king !!! to the defense of the d7-pawn...an awesome move!!!!
326,12,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Black decided to move one of his view pieces which can still move and attacks the queen.
327,12,6,Qd5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',But the white queen didn´t get intimidated by that. She simply approaches the black knight....and the black king!!
328,12,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Black tries to catch the queen again with his other knight.

330,12,9,Qg5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/6Q1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',White´s queen just goes back and forth back and forth provoking an over-extansion of black´s pieces. And black doesn´t see the trap!!!!
331,12,10,Qf4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p1np1n1p/8/4PQ2/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Here white missed something. He should have played 8.Qxg7 what would have resulted in the the trade of black´s pawn against white´s queen. Well white would have lost the exchange but would have had more than enough compensation because of black´s weak pawn-structure. (isolated f and h pwans)
332,12,11,Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/1ppn1pb1/p1npb2p/6p1/Q3P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ -',Black becomes aware of the fact that his defense has been weakened too much and retreats with his knight to add protection to the b8-square.

Or maybe he thought the queen is worth more than the rook. Lots of beginning players actually do think the so but recent scientific research has proven that this is nothing but a myth. The queen might be able to move diagonally but that´s not really an advantage for a couple reasons:
1. If you don´t pay attention the queen is way more likely than the rook to stalemate your opponents king in the endgame.
2. The queen starts the game very close to the center of the field where she can get under fire very easily. But the rooks start at the corner of the board where they can easily attack both flanks of your opponent´s army.
3. Last but not least the rook-pair has proven very strong in lots of chess games. Unfortunately it´s usually not possible to have a queen-pair early in the game."

337,12,16,1Nxg5,b'q4rk1/2pn1pb1/2npb2p/1p4N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Here white got rid of blacks pawns which are potential rooks in the endgame. Since a knight can never become a rook in the endgame white decided to trade it off too.

341,12,20,1Nd2,b'q4rk1/2pn1p2/2npb3/1p4B1/4P3/8/P1PN1PPP/b4RK1 b - -',White opens a discovered attack on black´s bishop while the knight is heading towards balck´s king. It´s only 4 moves away from delivering check now.
342,12,21,1Qxa2,b'5rk1/2pn1p2/2npb3/1p4B1/4P3/8/q1PN1PPP/b4RK1 w - -',A very loose move. Black becomes greedy and takes on a2. The move might have won a pawn but also weakened black´s back rank.
343,12,22,2Nh1,b'5rk1/2pn1p2/2np4/1p2b1B1/2b5/8/2q2PPP/5RKN b - -',Black now starts to mess arround because he doesn´t see any concrete plan while white builds up his defense structure.
344,12,23,2Bxh2+,b'5rk1/2pn1p2/2np4/1p4B1/2b5/8/2q2PPb/5RKN w - -',Black couldn´t take the pressure anymore and decided to sacrivice his bishop.

i'm not so sure I care about this move as white's clearly trying to protect from my rook with this move... which leads me to think white has no idea about what's to come."

If white puts a rook on C1 i'm going to sac my bishop with Bxd5 eventually.  cxd5 then Nxd5 and his bishop has to flee or exchange.  If there's an exchange Rg5... with a lot of assumptions.  pawn on f4 isn't there... and Rxe3 as the result of Nxe3."

Now I remember at University a player called Rod Newbury playing this against me. I was desparately thinking back to over 30 years ago! I had memories of playing d5 in this position and losing quickly although now I see in the opening databases d5 is playable although what I play here is more popular and has a higer ratings.
451,18,6,Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Both a6 and Qd2 are the most popular moves in this position - although of course at the time I didn't know that.

455,18,10,1a4,b'1r1q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p2p1np1/2pPn3/P1P1P3/2N1BP2/1PNQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ a3',I wanted to deter him from playing b5. Afterwards I found that f4 had led to a win in Raghuram Balaji… (2043) vs. Venkat Sundara… (2152). a5 had led to a draw in Petersen Wolfga… (2091) vs. Mueller Daniel (2260).

I am now going to compare my moves with the suggested moves of a computer. (This was done after the game obviously). The computer here recommends exf5 instead of f4
458,18,13,1Bxg4,b'1r1q1rk1/1p1bp1bp/p2p2p1/2pP1p1n/P1P1PPB1/2N1B3/1PNQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',The computer again recommend exf5

I thought the exchange had dragged his f pawn away from the centre and so had relived pressure on my centre. I had finally managed to castle and got rid of my white squared bishop. The computer recommends g3 instead of 0-0
460,18,15,1h3,b'1r1q1rk1/1p1bp1bp/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P1P1PP2/2N1B1pP/1PNQ2P1/R4RK1 b - -',I didn't want to open up my king's side position I though h3 kept everything under control. The computer thinks Qd3 or hxg3 is better. It thinks Black is better in this position. What do you think dear reader?
461,18,16,1Ne1,b'1rq2rk1/1p1bp1bp/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P1P1PP2/2N1B1pP/1P1Q2P1/R3NRK1 b - -',I didn't see much point to Qc8. He is never going to be able sac soundly on h3. So I decide to move my knight to a better square - d3 from where it will be protecting b2 and perhaps preparing to support e5. Computer prefers Qe2 or e5 and still thinks Black is better.

What we both missed but the computer didn't was that after Nxf1 25. Qd5+ e6! 26. Qxe6+ Rf7! and my knight on d7 is pinned so I can't take his rook on c8. This is why white should exchange pawns on d6 first.

Q: Who is better here?

A: To answer this question we need to know what the indicators are of an advantage. There are 5 indicators and they are as follows:
1. advantage in development and control of the centre
2. Possession of supporting points and open lines
3. material superiority
4. advantageous pawn structure

5. presence of weaknesses in the enemy position. 

Based upon the above indicators we can use the follow model to make a solid evaluation what white should play next. 

1. Material relationship
- The material relationship between forces is equal no advantage to either side.
2. Presence of direct threats
- white has no direct threat while black has the threat of securing the plus of a bishop pair with ...Nxb5. the advantage is to black. Black also has the strategically better ...c6 to harass the bishop which increases control of D5. 
3. King position and their safety
- white has castled to safety while the black king is still in the centre advantage white
4. Possession of support squares and open lines
- white current controls sole possession of the e-file while black has nothing advantage to white
5. Pawn structure weak and strong squares.
- both pawn structures are identical there are no immediate weaknesses and no strong squares have emerged no advantage to either side
6. The centre and space
- white currently enjoys more space and mobility based on the fact that he has great control and influence in the centre Black has yet to make a difference in the centre advantage white.
7. Development and position of pieces. 
-White has a slight lead in development because his king is castled. This however has not had a significant impact on the game White pieces are temporally more active but blacks piece are more harmoniously placed. neither side has an advantage

Conclusion:

Whites plan must include:
- must deal with the immediate threat of the bishop capture
- consolidate control in centre
- complete development

Black's plan must include:
- challenge for control in the centre
- fight for the e-file
-castle king to safety
- complete development

Final evaluation: White has a slight advantage. 

so as black I was expecting 8. Be2 f6 to fight for control of the e-file and challenge for space in the centre. "

*completely development would increase black'  current advantage in centre and space
*the king safety is not currently an issue so black can forgo castling in order to take advantage of tempo
*black currently does not have the resources to fight for the e-file.

There are lines of the Four Knights' where Black can play this move successfully but not when White is so well-developed. Black should have followed principles and castled here or played ...d6.
It is important to recognize and make use of inviting squares like d4 and so Black's impulse here is basically good. The problem is timing -- we can only make one move at a time in chess and redeploying an already-developed piece even to a really nice square usually needs to wait in line behind developing the other pieces and castling the King to safety."

Instead White plays for a safe edge (he's still up in development) which is understandable in a blitz game.

Note that Nxd5? is a poor choice because after ...exd5 the other Knight on c3 is pinned."

This Bishop makes a very annoying pin which gives White a lot of pressure. White could maintain the pin with Bh4 and now Black will be hesitant to play ...g5 unless he absolutely has to. 
I believe that White made this move thinking that he had a tactical justification based on a fork at d5 but that was a miscalculation. Much better would be to retreat to h4 and THEN aim for Nd5 piling on the pinned Knight.
It is usually not a good idea to trade off Bishops for Knights without a good reason in open games (because the Bishops' long reach are so useful when there are open diagonals) and that is especially true of this particular Bishop which is 1) White's ""Good Bishop"" (notice that most of White's pawns are on light squares so that this Bishop complements them very well) and 2) exerting a lot of pressure with this pin"

It seemed to me that black has two main tries.  When the Q goes to g4 he should be thinking about Rc4 to pressure e4 and Rc2 to exploit the pin on the rook.  But he also needs to be able to play Qd8 which defends f6 and also enables Bd7 (after Bh3).  The rook can also operate from c7 to help defend the king.  Happily for me black cannot employ all these ideas at once so it is a question of the most accurate move order to advance my attack.

900,39,14,1Nxd4,b'1r3rk1/3bqpbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/1pPNPP2/1P1P2PP/P2Q1BB1/1N1R1RK1 b - -',White probably sees this and so prevents it.
901,39,15,1g4,b'1r3rk1/3bqpbp/p2pp1p1/2p5/1pPnPPP1/1P1P3P/P2Q1BB1/1N1R1RK1 b - -',White prepares f5.
902,39,16,1Rde1,b'1r3rk1/3bqpbp/3pp1p1/p1p5/1pPnPPP1/1P1P3P/P2Q1BB1/1N2RRK1 b - -',White thinks my queen may be susceptible to attack after the pawns clear.
903,39,17,1a4,b'1r3rk1/3bqpbp/3pp1p1/2p5/ppPnPPP1/1P1P3P/P2Q1BB1/1N2RRK1 w - -',White cannot take it or else be left with a shattered queenside pawn structure.
904,39,18,2Bxd4,b'1r3rk1/3bqpbp/3pp1p1/2p5/ppPBPPP1/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N2RRK1 b - -',White gets rid of a defender of f5. However this leaves him a move behind as he has to deal with the check first. I see the reasons for this move but according to the computer analysis it's an inaccuracy.
905,39,19,2Kh1,b'1r3rk1/3bqp1p/3pp1p1/2p5/ppPbPPP1/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N2RR1K b - -',? Kh2 is much better since it prevents the eventual checkmate that was inevitable with Kh1.
906,39,20,2Qh4,b'1r3rk1/3b1p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/ppPbPPPq/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N2RR1K w - -',! This pins the white bishop to the pawn.  White still doesn't suspect Bc6's threats.
907,39,21,2f5,b'1r3rk1/3b1p1p/3pp1p1/2p2P2/ppPbP1Pq/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N2RR1K b - -',? The results of this exchange allows Bc6 to be disastrous for white especially with my DSB where it is.
908,39,22,Rbe8,b'4rrk1/3b1p1p/3p2p1/2p2P2/ppPb2Pq/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N2RR1K w - -',! Essentially giving white the delusion that white must take the e8 rook because of my rook +queen both attacking it. A clever trap.
909,39,23,2Rxe8,b'4Rrk1/3b1p1p/3p2p1/2p2P2/ppPb2Pq/1P1P3P/P2Q2B1/1N3R1K b - -',?? Now Bc6 is unstoppable and both my bishops queen and rook are all pointed pretty much directly at white's king. White only has 3 pieces to defend against my 4 because of the useless b1 knight.
910,39,24,2Qf4,b'4r1k1/3b1p1p/3p2p1/2p2P2/ppPb1QPq/1P1P3P/P5B1/1N3R1K b - -',?? Now instead of a large material loss it's a checkmate. The only defense is Kh2. White still doesn't see the threat of Bc6 and tries to initiate its own attack.
911,39,25,2Bc6,b'4r1k1/5p1p/2bp2p1/2p2P2/ppPb1QPq/1P1P3P/P5B1/1N3R1K w - -',If 26. Bxc6 then Qxh3+ 27. Qh2 Qxf1 28. Qg1 Qxg1#.  If white does anything else other than Kh2 black plays 26. ...Qxh3+ 27. Qh2 Bxg2#.  
912,39,26,Re2,b'6k1/5p1p/2bp2p1/2p2P2/ppPb1QPq/1P1P3P/P3r1BK/1N3R2 w - -',You can calculate the remaining moves. This is my best attack in terms of planning and execution to date!
