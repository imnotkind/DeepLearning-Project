17,1,2,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',black shouldn't mind changing the bishop for the knight on c6. with a strong center and a pair of bishops in an open game it is clearly that he is on the upper hand.
18,1,3,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',bringing the rook to the game. the e file is a great place for it.

But this knight also hits the very weak f6 square. It was hard for me to see anything he could do. So in a way I used this knight as bait.

201,11,0,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move. 
202,11,1,Nc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Ok; but given Black's lacklustre start 3.c3 aiming to play d4 with a massive centre looks more ambitious.
203,11,2,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Stops the white knight coming to d5 but at the cost of now blocking the c6 sq for his b8 knight.  Not a great start by Black.  Better would be ...Nc6 hoping for the best.
204,11,3,d3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A better bet would be 4.d4! Then if ...exd4 5.Qxd4 (attacking the misplaced bishop on d6) and if Black protects with 5...Qf6 6. e5 forks bishop and queen.
205,11,4,h6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2pb3p/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Because White is not challenging the centre (4. d3) Black is allowed to get away with a whole series of inconsequential pawn moves intended to hinder White but at the cost of lots of tempi (moves).

Nxe5 since his e4-pawn is protected).  Now if he can get in ...d6 Black may stand ok.
207,11,6,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Again perfectly alright but just Nxe5 is simpler. If Black had replied ...Qa5 (seemingly attacking both the knight on e5 and threatening to take twice on c3) White has the nice interposing move 7. Nc4! attacking the Black Queen.   6. 0-0 would also have been more enterprising not fearing the doubled pawns after ...Bxc3  7.bxc3 when White could play d4 supported by the new pawn at c3.

White had no need to fear the further advance of the b-pawn as the Ra8 is undenfended after 12...b4  13. axb4 ...13 axb4??  Simlarly if Black is hoping to play ...a4 why not let him?  With Black's king about to get killed there's no need to think about the endgame...

Or why not open up further with 19. d5!? (revealing an attack on the Qf6 from the b2 bishop and simultaneously attacking the bishop on e6).  After 19 ...Qxb2  20. dxe6 and it's nearly over - so vulnerable is B's king.

This bad move weakens the white squares around White's king when Black's white-sq bishop is still on the board - hardly ever a good plan.  It also ties W's queen to the defence of the f3 knight (no longer pawn-protected and threatened by B's Qf6).  
220,11,19,2Bd5,b'rn3rk1/5p2/2p2q1p/1p1b2p1/pP1PR3/P1P2NP1/1B3P1P/R2Q2K1 w - -',Black could now have taken advantage of White's last to force a draw: 20...Bb3 (attacking the queen) 21. Qe2 (White must stay protecting the f3 sq) 21...Bc4  22. Qc2 and 22...Bb3 again etc.

He is a pawn up but the opposite coloured bishops make a draw probable (since once side will control all the dark sqaures while the other all the light).  White - if he wants to press his negligible advantage should try to keep the major pieces on the board.  Black though has little to fear now - just look at the difference in the bishops: Black's is posing deadly threats to white's king while White's is hidden behind a mass of his own pawns (that move 19.c3?).

But in fact Black is still very much in control after 30....Qh5  (e.g. Kd2 ...Qf3  Qb7  ...Kf6 Bb2 ... Qxf2  and checkmate in 2 moves wherever White goes!)  For this reason White should play first 30.Bg5 ! (before capturing the rook) with the ability then to get his rook into the game in a move or so's time.  Black can't take on g5 (30...hxg5??) as his Queen would be en pris on h2.

Black's next few moves will determine what plan I should take; d4 contests black's pawn in the center and also opens a line for the Bc2.  Note how much better this is than d3 which prevents Bd3 if black plays Na5.

Since black has committed himself to playing Bb7 I felt the need to defend the e4 pawn again.  Also my knight on d2 would look better on g3 and I'll need to vacate the f1 square in order to get it there!

Dave is for all intents and purposes even with me now.  White still has a slight edge in space and development while black has a slight edge in material.

Take stock of this position now because black is going to lose the game *positionally* in the next three moves."

Because white doesn't want his bishop on c4 it's much better on d3.  Black basically forces white to move it there as it's the only way to defend both the bishop and the e4 pawn other than moving the Nf1 back to d2.  But it puts black's knight in a far worse position with nowhere to go except back to c6.  As white is already ahead in space and development I don't think black can afford this.
561,29,15,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p1b1n2/n3p3/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQRNK1 b - -',The only move.

But with the rook supporting the e4 pawn can black's e5 pawn really be considered a threat to white's d4 pawn and does it need the support of a pawn on c5?
563,29,17,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1p1b1n2/n1p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R2QRNK1 b - -',!?  A very strong pin now as it's going to be very hard for black to get out of this without either weakening his kingside or abandoning the e5 pawn with something like Be7.  Of course I overlooked the simple dxe5! which wins a piece immediately!
564,29,18,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/2p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R2QRNK1 w - -',?!  Not really a terrible move but it does nothing to relieve the pressure on the f6 knight.  What's more is that Dave mistakenly believes he has built up good pressure on the d4 pawn.  While that's true it isn't going to be very useful.
565,29,19,1Ng3,b'r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/2p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1NN1/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',!  Simple but strong.  Remember I told you to take stock after black's 9th move?  Well now it's 3 1/2 moves later.  How have things changed?  White's knight moved from d2 to g3 his bishop moved from c4 to d3 and his other bishop moved from c1 to g5.  Black on the other hand has moved his c7 pawn to c5.  White has three pieces that are more active black has one more pawn contesting the center on the queenside where the action isn't.  Who made the better call here?  I have to conclude that Dave dug himself a big hole with his last three moves.

Look at how strong the white bishops are look at the nice open d1-h5 diagonal for the queen and look at how well positioned the knight on g3 is!  And to address this threat Dave is going to play dxc3?  Win that pawn Dave.  Win it now.

But then I realized that the bishop was practically immune!  If Qxf6 white plays Nxd7 forking queen and rook and making life very uncomfortable for black.  If gxf6 white has a mate in three starting with Qg4 !  And if black moves the queen away with something like Qc7 white has Bxg7 where the black king has no good way of defending himself.

If black plays anything else white has Qg7#.  Sorry grader you get an F on this one.  F for umm... foresight.  These weren't awful moves that he made but he was unaware of the dangers of white's setup and plans.  We've got another game with the colors reversed coming up though -- if he wins I fully expect to get trashed in HIS annotations!

Also as this weighs in in under 20 moves it sure does count as a miniature my first one in awhile... sorry Dave!"

580,30,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Black decides to just develop normally and allow a trasposion to the Yugoslav Attack which normally goes more like 5.f3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nc6 etc without commiting the King's bishop.
581,30,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Here black could consider 7...Ng4. There is a win for black in the GK database but 8.Bb5  Kf8 seemed a bit too commital for my taste. In the game the black king eventually walked to f7 thus freeing the rook. Now white chooses tro transpose to Yugoslav mainline.

584,30,6,1Bb3,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',Common theme - the bishop gets out of the fire to mantain central tension; after 11.h4 Nxd4 white is forced to capture with the queen.
585,30,7,1g4,b'2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP1P1/1BN1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR3R b - g3',This is somewhat uncommon move propably played to prevent ...h5 at some stage. 12.h4 is in my opinion more to the point as the move g4 can turn out to be unnecessary. 12.Kb1 is a possibility too.

The game is now reaching the middlegame and both sides need to find a plan to follow. If allowed white will play h4-h5xg6 Be3-h6xg7 Qh6 and mate on the h-file. In general there are two kinds of plans that black can adopt. The first is to play the minimum amount of defencive moves on the kingside and take all measures possible to embarrass the white king on the queenside - a common race-situation. The other one is completely ignore whites play and try to find a sac-sac-mate-solution!.

In this position it seems that black needs to find something more than ...Qc7 ...Rfc8 etc since whites attack is likely to be quicker. 14...Re8 is one approach aiming to keep the dark squared bishops on board and maybe prepare ....Qa5. I opted for different solution."

I don't remember any more what I would have responded in the event of Nxb5 but I do remember that it would have ignited blacks attack. Materialism is out of picture in these situations so I think it would've been bit dubious to take the pawn.
589,30,11,1b3,b'3q1rk1/p2bppbp/3p1np1/1p6/2rNP1P1/1PN1BP2/P1PQ3P/1K1R3R b - -',Interesting although all weakening moves should be treated with suspicion. Here I thought for a long time but the thing is that the rook does not have a good retreat square. So I figured out that the rook would have to go. I have to admit still that I had in mind that complications are my only chance to beat a player over 200 elo higher than me. This is bit unhealthy aproach and I think I should try to get over that kind of attitude.

591,30,13,Qc7,b'5rk1/p1qbppbp/3p1np1/8/2PNP1P1/2Q1BP2/P1P4P/1K1R3R w - -',So the thing here is that now it is black who has all the direct threats and long term pressure towards the king. Play on the b-file is premature but it is not a shame to let white take over that file - after all he has to play Ka1 to achieve that and it makes my bishop quite a threatening piece. White isn't now in form to attack on the kingside but then again he is an exchenge and a pawn up. My guess is that this position should be somewhat better for white.

595,30,17,Nd6,b'2r3k1/p1qbppbp/3n2p1/3P2P1/2PN4/2Q1BP2/P1P4P/KR5R w - -',The knight has obviously improved as has the bishop so it has to be said that black has made progress. The loss of the d-pawn is at the moment important as the c4-pawn is about fall and d5-pawn after that too. White now tries to roll blakc over whit those pawns to make as much damage as he can. 
596,30,18,Nb5,b'2r3k1/p1qbppbp/6p1/1nPP2P1/3N4/2Q1BP2/P1P4P/KR5R w - -',Other moves are out of question owing to 23.c6!

598,30,20,2Rxb5,b'2r3k1/p2bppbp/6p1/1RqP2P1/3N4/4BP2/P1PQ3P/K6R b - -',Now white feels obligated to return the exchange but black could've won it back anyway with say 24.Rhe1 Nc3. In that position the c3 knight may be well worth a rook though.

There could be a better plan don't know about that. 26...Bxd4 looks terrible although black can then win a pawn. (Bxd4 Qxf3) I really didn't want white pieces to get unnecessary activity.

The rook is better on a6 than c8 but allowing check in the back rank forces ...Bf8 which of course restricts the bishop. I maybe should have played the calm ...e6 cutting out any f5-ideas giving the dark-squared bishop alternative diagonal and keeping the tension. 
604,30,26,Ra6,b'6k1/p3ppbp/r5p1/3q2P1/2bN1P1P/2P1B3/P1RQ4/K7 w - -',And now I actually started to have time trouble. I saw that the pressure on a2 does cramp white so that I could pick a pawn but I felt strongly that is was a wrong way to proceed - but I simply couldn't come up with a better plan. So I crossed my fingers and went for the pawn.
605,30,27,3Rb8+,b'1R4k1/p3ppbp/r5p1/6P1/2bN1P1q/2P1B3/P2Q4/K7 b - -',White can't live without this check as the rook on b1 is a tactical liability. For example 32.Nf3?? Bxc3  and 32. Bf2? Qxf4!

Other possibility that I looked was Qc6 with the idea of Qc7. There was however 36.Na5 with complications. I must say that I'm not too happy with myself landing in this position where white has the better bishop and some activity for the modest price of a pawn. I'd like to have some open analysis for this position too!"

 I also like the open positions a queen's pawn game can lead to. This puts us in the Queen's 
Indian Defense. I like the QS fianchetto as it puts the bishop in attacking position on his castled 
king ( when he castles). I will still be able to get my DS Bishop out and allow for the castle. I always 
like a knight on f6 when I castle king side. I do have a tendency to forget to defend it with 
something besides the g pawn sometimes and end up with a torn up pawn defense in front 
of my king. I often move B-e7 to avoid the getting the knight pinned to the queen. B-b7 B-e7 
or B-b4 will likely be my next move I will be inclined to move the BS bishop to allow for a castle asap.
