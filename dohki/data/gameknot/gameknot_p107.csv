0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I am no longer an e4 player due to the monster of theory that is the sicilian defence. I have sadly gone the way of opening with the more quiet d4 and have adopted the colle system nowadays. However this game was agreed as being a Danish Gambit accepted so I need not worry about 1 ...c5
1,0,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Offering another pawn for time and space to develop quickly and prepare an attack.

3,0,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',(-1.21) Gambiting the second pawn.
4,0,4,cxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/Pp3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',(-1.29)
5,0,5,Bxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',(-1.13) This is the starting position of the game. I used to play the Danish Gambit as white on the odd occasion and still do in blitz chess. This opening is a relic from the olden days of romantic chess. It doesn't have a refutation i'm aware of but if black exchanges early on and defends well he will have the superior endgame. 
6,0,6,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',(-1.17)
7,0,7,Nd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',(-1.37) This is slighlty better than 6. Nc3 because it leaves the b2 bishop active surveying the a1-h8 diagonal where the white king will be castled.
8,0,8,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',(-1.45)
9,0,9,Qb3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/1Q6/PB1N1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',(-3.43) This creates a battery aiming at f7 and also threatening black's dark squared bishop. I was also trying to tempt ...Nxe4.  The computer says this is a blunder suggesting 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O d6 9. a3 Bc5 10. e5 dxe5 11. Nxe5. The computer evaluates black as having a moderate advantage here. 
10,0,10,Bxd2+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1b1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',(-3.59) Black exchanges removing one of his only developed pieces instead of retreating or defending the bishop this does have the positive of forcing my king to recapture losing castling rights and leaving it in a central position wide open to attack.
11,0,11,Kxd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR b kq -',(-3.51) I'm feeling uneasy with my king positioned here especially considering the strength of my opponent but there is no alternative.
12,0,12,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR w - -',(-1.97) I can see the logic in this  castling early to protect the king and trying to avoid grabbing more pawns at the expense of development howvever better is 8... Nxe4+ 9. Kc2 O-O 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. Bd5 Nf6 12. Bc3 d6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 leaving black with a large queenside majority and white with an exposed king and no realistic attacking threats as compensation.
13,0,13,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2B5/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR b - -',(-3.83) My immediate thought here was to remove the Kings Knight the only piece defending the king-side. The computer analysis says this is a  MISTAKE better is  9. Qf3 d5 10. Bxf6 dxe4+ 11. Bxd8 Rxd8+ 12. Kc3 exf3 13. Nxf3 Nc6 14. Ng5 Ne5 however this leaves black with a decisive advantage. To be fair though with good defence by black white should not be able to win from here. 
14,0,14,Ne4+,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2B1n3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR w - -',(-3.51) The only alternative is 9...Ng4 but 9...Ne4+ immediately challenegs the king while also centralising the knight and attacking f2. 
15,0,15,1Ke3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2B1n3/1Q2K3/PB3PPP/R5NR b - -',(-3.67) Computer; Defending f2 chosen as opposed to Ke1 because I didn;t want to block communications between my rooks witha nother piece. INACCURACY 10. Ke1 Qh4 11. Qc2 Nxf2 12. Nf3 Nd3+ 13. Kf1 Nb4 14. Rd1 is better apparently.

18,0,18,1Qg5+,b'rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P1q1/2B5/4K3/PBQ2PPP/R5NR w - -',(-2.34) Black is wasting time here with a pointless check and allowing me to parry by marching one of my kingside pawns up the board. Comp: MISTAKE 11... d5 12. Rd1 c6 13. Bb3 Qa5 14. Bc3 Qb5 15. Kd2 Bg4 16. Nf3 leaves black with a strong grip in the centre and only one piece behind in development and obviously two pawns up.
19,0,19,1f4,b'rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P1q1/2B2P2/4K3/PBQ3PP/R5NR b - f3',(-2.42) 
20,0,20,1Qd8,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P3/2B2P2/4K3/PBQ3PP/R5NR w - -',(-1.13) Retreating to its starting point has essentially given me an extra move attacking the kingside generally not a good idea in the Danish Gambit. Black has no pieces protecting the kingside and qyeenside pieces are yet to leave the back rank. I feel this position is promising for white. Comp: 12... Qh6 13. Ne2 d6 14. Kf2 Bg4 15. exd6 cxd6 16. Kg1 Nc6 and black has fully devloped his pieces yet there is still some energy in the position for white. 
21,0,21,1h4,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P3/2B2P1P/4K3/PBQ3P1/R5NR b - h3',(-2.82) Having played f4 I feel a pawn storm brewing which forces black to consider the defence of the kingside. The computer prefers 13. Rd1 Nc6 14. Nf3 h6 15. Kf2 b6 16. g3 Ba6 
22,0,22,1d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/2n1P3/2B2P1P/4K3/PBQ3P1/R5NR w - -',(-3.15) Opening the diagonal for the lightsquared bishop and contesting the centre.
23,0,23,1h5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/2n1P2P/2B2P2/4K3/PBQ3P1/R5NR b - -',(-3.51) I continued my plan of aussaulting the king ASAP before black could mobilise pieces to aid in its defence. Hoevever the computer sees this as a mistake suggesting  14. Nf3 Nc6 15. Ng5 g6 16. Kf2 b5 17. Bxf7+ Rxf7 18. Nxf7 
24,0,24,1d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/2npP2P/2B2P2/4K3/PBQ3P1/R5NR w - -',(-1.77) Again neglecting development. The analysis suggests  14... Nc6 15. Rd1 Qe7 16. Kf2 dxe5 17. Nf3 exf4 18. Rhe1 Be6 with a dynamic position.
25,0,25,1Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/2npP2P/5P2/3BK3/PBQ3P1/R5NR b - -',(-3.31) This was not the best move the light squared bishop is a key attacking piece for me and I shouldn't be allowing a trade.Computer suggests: 15. Ba3 Nbd7 16. Bxd5 Nb6 17. Qxc5 Nxd5+ 18. Kf2 Re8 19. Ne2 is better
26,0,26,1Nxd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3pP2P/5P2/3nK3/PBQ3P1/R5NR w - -',(-3.43) Accepting the trade the only positive for me is it removes blacks only developed piece.

28,0,28,1c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/8/2ppP2P/5P2/3QK3/PB4P1/R5NR w - c6',(-3.27) Seizing control of d4 and leaving c3 for the devlopemnt of the knight. Also threatening ...d4! at some point removing the bishops scope along the diagonal.
29,0,29,1Kf2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/8/2ppP2P/5P2/3Q4/PB3KP1/R5NR b - -',(-3.43) Retreating before black could get ...d5 in.

31,0,31,1Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/8/3pP2P/2p2P2/8/PBQ2KP1/R5NR b - -',(-4.24) Retreating to c2 wanting to maintain my reach on h7. The computer says MISTAKE! 18. Qd2 Nc6 19. Ne2 Bg4 20. Nd4 Qb6 21. h6 Nxd4 22. Qxd4 
32,0,32,1b5,b'rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/8/1p1pP2P/2p2P2/8/PBQ2KP1/R5NR w - b6',(-2.86) Overprotecting the c4 pawn perhaps envisaging an early d4 but black is still not developing the pieces on the Q-side. Comp: MISTAKE 18... Nc6 19. Ba3 Qb6+ 20. Kf1 Qd4 21. Qc1 Qd3+ 22. Kf2 Nd4

My move has the psychological advantage of forcing black to consider his defence again and to avoid this trap.

(-6.9) I thought this move was Morphyesque at the time there is no going back from this position I have to continue the attack so I decide to sac the night opening the h-file. Whats not to like? The computer does not agree with my move though assessing it as a BLUNDER 22. Qe4 Bd7 23. fxg7 Re8 24. Bxd4 Nxd4 25. Qxd4 Qb6 26. Rad1. I feel if I had not played such a move which forced black to open a file to his king I wouldn't be able to launch a succesful attack.

(-20.4) Before this move I assesed the position and realised that blacks phalanx of three connected past pawns would soon overcome my resistance if I couldn't somehow strike out at the king.

It is one of the first open games I've played in a while and really encourages me to return to e4. I can't really compare myself to the great Morphy with my attacking play in this game but I do feel this is one of the best games I've played and this game is considerably more like one of Morphy's games than my typical games which are played according to my unambitious repertoire of the colle as white and the caro kann & QGD as black.

81,2,6,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Removes the pin as well as preparing to castle. My King has a pool table so it is a pretty legit castle.
82,2,7,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Opens up his light squared bishop. I believe this is all standard so far.
83,2,8,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',Chillin' like a villain with a pool table.
84,2,9,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Developing move.
85,2,10,dxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',So i think i played this a bit too prematurely. This allows him to simply recapture with the bishop thus developing a piece. My eventual goal was to play c5 to contest the center and i didn't want a scenario like 6...c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8.cxd5 exd5 which would leave me with an isolated d pawn. In  retrospect i don't think this was best.
86,2,11,Bxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',develops his bishop with the recapture.
87,2,12,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',um... i think i was looking for a caro-kann type structure but with the bishop still closed in on the back rank this just seems bad. Now my Knight doesn't have the c6 square to go to either. I don't really know what i was thinking but i don't like it.
88,2,13,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Goes into safety however i doubt his castle has a pool table like mine.
89,2,14,Nd5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3n2B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',forces the exchange of bishops however i don't think this benefits me too much as my other bishop is blocked in and i am exchanging my good bishop for his bad one even if it is outside his pawn chain... It is clear that i'm not playing winning chess right now.
90,2,15,1Qb3,b'rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Gets the evil succubus into play and piles up on the knight at d5. However my pawns have him pretty reinforced for now.
91,2,16,1Nd7,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',develops my Knight i need some catching up to do.
92,2,17,1Bd3,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Was that exchange beneficial for him? 
93,2,18,1Nf6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So my bishop sees some light although he is still considered bad. At this point i was really looking to try to exchange him...
94,2,19,1h3,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',takes away the g4 square.
95,2,20,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn3/1Q1BPN1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Centralizes the knight. I wouldn't mind him exchanging his good bishop for my knight.
96,2,21,1Rac1,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn3/1Q1BPN1P/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 b - -',but that wasn't in the cards. Instead he gets his Rook over to a semi-open file.
97,2,22,1Ng5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p5/3p2n1/3P4/1Q1BPN1P/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 w - -',My intention here was to try to entice the exchange of knights and after the eventual recapture with my queen i could move my bishop out with the threat of Bxh3 or even Bf5 enticing the exchange of bishops. At this point i didn't have a definitive plan of action and was just trying to simplify. Not the greatest strategy but at least i was striving for something...
98,2,23,Qxg5,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p2q1/3P4/1Q1BP2P/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 w - -',So he accepts the exchange.
99,2,24,1Kh2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p2q1/3P4/1Q1BP2P/PP3PPK/2R2R2 b - -',Preventing Bxh3. Something i also failed to recognize at the time was that Bf5 simply hangs a pawn after the exchange which certainly wouldn't help my cause.
100,2,25,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p2q1/3P4/1Q1BP2P/PP3PPK/2R2R2 w - -',So i move my rook over to a semi-open file just trying to get some activity for my pieces.
101,2,26,1Qc2,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2p5/3p2q1/3P4/3BP2P/PPQ2PPK/2R2R2 b - -',Doubling up on the diagonal and threatening the h7 orchid.
102,2,27,1Re6,b'r1b3k1/pp3ppp/2p1r3/3p2q1/3P4/3BP2P/PPQ2PPK/2R2R2 w - -',My goal here was to sac a pawn in an attempt to gain activity for the rook and eventually pile up on the king side. In retrospect i believe this was simply unsound. 
103,2,28,1Bf5,b'r1b4k/pp3pp1/2p1r3/3p1Bq1/3P4/4P2P/PPQ2PPK/2R2R2 b - -',So now i'm a pawn down. Great...
104,2,29,1Rh6,b'r1b4k/pp3pp1/2p4r/3p1Bq1/3P4/4P2P/PPQ2PPK/2R2R2 w - -',Continuing with my plan simply because i just can't see what else to do...
105,2,30,2Bxc8,b'r1B4k/pp3pp1/2p4r/3p2q1/3P4/4P2P/PPQ2PPK/2R2R2 b - -',Well hey... at least my bad bishop is off the board now.
106,2,31,2Qe2,b'2r4k/pp3pp1/2p4r/3p2q1/3P4/4P2P/PP2QPPK/2R2R2 b - -',I don't know the purpose of this move?
107,2,32,2g6,b'2r4k/pp3p2/2p3pr/3p2q1/3P4/4P2P/PP2QPPK/2R2R2 w - -',My goal here was to get my king of the back rank and try to pile up on the semi-open files. 
108,2,33,2f4,b'2r4k/pp3p2/2p3pr/3p2q1/3P1P2/4P2P/PP2Q1PK/2R2R2 b - f3',This creates a target at e3 although i don't really have the manpower to take advantage of it.
109,2,34,2Qe7,b'2r4k/pp2qp2/2p3pr/3p4/3P1P2/4P2P/PP2Q1PK/2R2R2 w - -',Still it is something to look at at least. At this point i was thinking maybe i could exchange queens try to keep the board locked up and hope for a draw.
110,2,35,2Qg4,b'2r4k/pp2qp2/2p3pr/3p4/3P1PQ1/4P2P/PP4PK/2R2R2 b - -',threatening my rook on the back rank maybe now i can make use of that target at e3?
111,2,36,2f5,b'2r4k/pp2q3/2p3pr/3p1p2/3P1PQ1/4P2P/PP4PK/2R2R2 w - f6',Or not... This makes the queen move and it adds more manpower to cover the e4 square. But maybe better was Re8?
112,2,37,2Qf3,b'2r4k/pp2q3/2p3pr/3p1p2/3P1P2/4PQ1P/PP4PK/2R2R2 b - -',I'm out of ideas other then remove the queens and try to get a draw.
113,2,38,2Qe4,b'2r4k/pp6/2p3pr/3p1p2/3PqP2/4PQ1P/PP4PK/2R2R2 w - -',So i went for it.
114,2,39,2Qxe4,b'2r4k/pp6/2p3pr/3p1p2/3PQP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R2R2 b - -',And he accepts the exchange.
115,2,40,2dxe4,b'2r4k/pp6/2p3pr/5p2/3PpP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R2R2 w - -',So now i should be focused on getting my rooks into play. especially the one on h6 who simply put sucks.
116,2,41,2Rc5,b'2r4k/pp6/2p3pr/2R2p2/3PpP2/4P2P/PP4PK/5R2 b - -',Oh dear... so he is going to double up on the c file and then push that d pawn. i feel like i'm in rough shape here.
117,2,42,2Rh7,b'2r4k/pp5r/2p3p1/2R2p2/3PpP2/4P2P/PP4PK/5R2 w - -',Just trying to get as much reinforcements as possible over there. perhaps b6 was better?
118,2,43,2Rfc1,b'2r4k/pp5r/2p3p1/2R2p2/3PpP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R5 b - -',So he is doubled up now and that looming pawn push is looking pretty nasty right now.
119,2,44,2Rd7,b'2r4k/pp1r4/2p3p1/2R2p2/3PpP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R5 w - -',If he is going to push the pawn and ultimately exchange at least i'll have a rook on an open file afterwards. Things are looking pretty bleak.
120,2,45,2d5,b'2r4k/pp1r4/2p3p1/2RP1p2/4pP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R5 b - -',And sure enough there it is.
121,2,46,2Rd6,b'2r4k/pp6/2pr2p1/2RP1p2/4pP2/4P2P/PP4PK/2R5 w - -',Defending c6 with all the material i have however after he starts pushing is a and b pawns i'm not going to have enough man power to defend it.
122,2,47,2b4,b'2r4k/pp6/2pr2p1/2RP1p2/1P2pP2/4P2P/P5PK/2R5 b - b3',And sure enough here they come.
123,2,48,2a6,b'2r4k/1p6/p1pr2p1/2RP1p2/1P2pP2/4P2P/P5PK/2R5 w - -',Holding on with every little bit i have.
124,2,49,3a4,b'2r4k/1p6/p1pr2p1/2RP1p2/PP2pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 b - a3',Unfortunately for me he simply has more.
125,2,50,3Kg7,b'2r5/1p4k1/p1pr2p1/2RP1p2/PP2pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',Trying to get my king involved in some action although at this point c6 is a lost cause.
126,2,51,3b5,b'2r5/1p4k1/p1pr2p1/1PRP1p2/P3pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 b - -',He continues to advance and rightfully so. 
127,2,52,3axb5,b'2r5/1p4k1/2pr2p1/1pRP1p2/P3pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',fighting back with what little i have over on that side of the board.
128,2,53,3axb5,b'2r5/1p4k1/2pr2p1/1PRP1p2/4pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 b - -',And now i'm in a bit of a hole.
129,2,54,3Rcd8,b'3r4/1p4k1/2pr2p1/1PRP1p2/4pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',Well i might as well double up on the soon to be open file see if i can find any sort of counter play.
130,2,55,3Rc5xc6,b'3r4/6k1/2Rr2p1/1P3p2/4pP2/4P2P/6PK/2R5 b - -',An exchange here will simply leave me with an eventual loss. So lets try to find some counter play.
131,2,56,3Rd6d3,b'3r4/6k1/2R3p1/1P3p2/4pP2/3rP2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',Targets the week and backwards e pawn that i was wishing i could successfully target some time ago.
132,2,57,3b6,b'3r4/6k1/1PR3p1/5p2/4pP2/3rP2P/6PK/2R5 b - -',I'm not too sure about this move. If he had played Rb1 first the pawn would be far more imposing. However now he is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.
133,2,58,3Rb3,b'3r4/6k1/1PR3p1/5p2/4pP2/1r2P2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',Rooks belong behind passed pawns and because he neglected to move his rook to b1 i will happily get behind his pawn. Although i am still behind it looked like a little glimmer of hope.
134,2,59,3Rc6c7+,b'3r4/2R3k1/1P4p1/5p2/4pP2/1r2P2P/6PK/2R5 b - -',If i move to the back rank b7 is the death of me.
135,2,60,3Kh6,b'3r4/2R5/1P4pk/5p2/4pP2/1r2P2P/6PK/2R5 w - -',So i move over here. Still this is a pretty dangerous area for my king as now i don't have anywhere to go.
136,2,61,3Rc1c6,b'3r4/2R5/1PR3pk/5p2/4pP2/1r2P2P/6PK/8 b - -',Pins my g pawn to my king. I'm still in quite rough shape.
137,2,62,3Rb8,b'1r6/2R5/1PR3pk/5p2/4pP2/1r2P2P/6PK/8 w - -',Protecting myself from the very imposing pawn.
138,2,63,3g4,b'1r6/2R5/1PR3pk/5p2/4pPP1/1r2P2P/7K/8 b - g3',My king has no where to run to. I have to take otherwise g5 Kh5  Rh7#.
139,2,64,Rxe3,b'1r6/2R5/1PR3pk/8/4pPP1/4r3/7K/8 w - -',Now i reduced the material advantage to one pawn and it actually seems like i have a tiny shred of counter play going on.
140,2,65,4f5,b'1r6/2R5/1PR3pk/5P2/4p1P1/4r3/7K/8 b - -',Piling up on the pinned pawn.
141,2,66,4Kg5,b'1r6/2R5/1PR3p1/5Pk1/4p1P1/4r3/7K/8 w - -',Now i have an open file for my rook on the back rank. There is some light although not much.
142,2,67,4Rxg6+,b'1r6/2R5/1P4R1/5Pk1/4p1P1/4r3/7K/8 b - -',I'm desperately trying to get some counter play so that pawn is the least of my worries.
143,2,68,4Kf4,b'1r6/2R5/1P4R1/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/7K/8 w - -',Now it actually seems like i have some legitimate counter play going on. 
144,2,69,4Rgg7,b'1r6/2R3R1/1P6/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/7K/8 b - -',? so after this move my opponent actually offered me a draw. Only a few moves ago i would of been eager to accept a draw although now it seems as though i have a legitimate shot at this game.
145,2,70,4Rxb6,b'8/2R3R1/1r6/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/7K/8 w - -',So seeing a light at the end of the tunnel i decide to play on. I have held on long enough and now i feel like i am back and better now than i have been all game.
146,2,71,4Rcb7,b'8/1R4R1/1r6/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/7K/8 b - -',trying to trade off rooks however i am not remotely interested in that.
147,2,72,4Rh6+,b'8/1R4R1/7r/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/7K/8 w - -',And just like that my rooks are extremely active and his king has no protection from his pieces.
148,2,73,4Kg2,b'8/1R4R1/7r/5P2/4pkP1/4r3/6K1/8 b - -',Things are looking great for me now.
149,2,74,4Kf1,b'8/1R4R1/7r/5P2/4pkP1/6r1/8/5K2 b - -',His fate is pretty much sealed now.
150,2,75,4Rh1+,b'8/1R4R1/8/5P2/4pkP1/6r1/8/5K1r w - -',Here comes the hammer.
151,2,76,4Kf1,b'8/1R4R1/8/5P2/4pkP1/6r1/7r/5K2 b - -',So his king is stuck on the back rank and he has some serious problems.
152,2,77,4Kf3,b'8/1R4R1/8/5P2/4p1P1/5kr1/7r/5K2 w - -',The winning move.
153,2,78,4Rb3+,b'8/6R1/8/5P2/4p1P1/1R3kr1/7r/5K2 b - -',A desperate attempt to prevent the mate.
154,2,79,4e3,b'8/6R1/8/5P2/6P1/1R2pkr1/7r/5K2 w - -',However it is easily parried. And with this my opponent resigned leaving my a kind message as well. So although i was down for pretty much the entire game i held on and with a little luck managed to pull out a win. Thanks to drpat23 for playing a great game with me.

163,3,8,d5,b'r3k2r/4bppp/p4n2/N2p4/4b3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',White needs to be aware of the Knights on the same diagonal with a DSB lurking.  Black chooses to keep the Bishop up the board.  Also the d-pawn is vunerable and Black needs to get something for it.

166,3,11,Rac8,b'2r4r/3k1ppp/pB3n2/8/2N5/5P2/P5PP/R5K1 w - -',Black is aware that there are forking opportunities for a roaming Knight.  It doesn't help Black that a King two Rooks and some pawns will be close together. Black is concious of where to place the rooks in relation to each other and the King.
167,3,12,Rhe8,b'2r1r3/5ppp/pB2kn2/4N3/8/5P2/P5PP/4R1K1 w - -',With a discovered check coming Black wanted to threaten immediately after the King moved. An unprotected d6 would be perfect for a White Knight.
168,3,13,2Rxe8,b'2r1R3/3k1ppp/pB3nN1/8/8/5P2/P5PP/6K1 b - -',Maybe with two threatened pieces he had to exchange

He would first construct an unbreakable center with pawns on d3 and c3 in order to keep his opponent at arms length.

The answer: Nimzowitish once said that chess mastery was revealed by making a pawn move on the wing with your mind on the center.

Black gives up control of d5 in order to gain a lions share of the c -file especially c5 and c4. If white is not careful a black knight on c4 is the barer of doom and gloom. Therefore white must play to prevent that from happening.

From here it can get quite mind boggling the options that are available to black. For example a popular alternative to ...Qc7 is 11. ...Nd7 12. Nbd2 and now a) 12. ...cxd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 14. Nb3 a5 15.

Nf1 with cxd4 14. cxd4 exd4 15. Nxd4 d5 16. e5 Ne4 17. f3 Bc5 18. fxe4 dxe4  with complications that seem to favor black. But what about 13. ...c4? the answer is 13. ...c4 14. b4! Nc6 15. d5 Nb8 16. a4 black's queen side pawns are under stress. The other main reason why white plays b3 is to play Bb2 in the event that black does play 13. ...cxd4 14. cxd4 Nc6 15. Bb2 supporting the d4-pawn

On the queen side white has established a characteristic ""attacking"" pawn structure. The black knight on a5 has no single good safe square. It is therefore easy to conclude that white is better. But by how much? The blocked lines in the center and on the queen side are also impeding the white pieces. So I would assess the position as objectively only slightly better for white but the kind that is horrible to defend against.  "

269,7,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So here it is: the caro-kann. After white's next move black will almost always play d5 to get a good center and good development.
270,7,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Main line is 2d4. White is not a player that studies openings.
271,7,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Better was probably Nc3 to defend the pawn this loses the pawn or trade queens and white can't castle.
272,7,3,Kxd1,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBK1B1R b kq -',And that is exactly what happens. White cannot castle although the chess game database still favors white. I think it's because white can develop his pieces very fast while black has a little trouble with it.
273,7,4,Nd7,b'r3kbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/4P1b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBK3R w kq -',I didn't play this because I wanted to castle long but because I wanted to have my rook on d8. I believe castling long is weaker than castling short so I will try to castle short here although it will take a while.
274,7,5,g4,b'r3kbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/7b/4P1P1/5N1P/PPP1BP2/RNBK3R b kq g3',This move seems to weaken white's kingside.
275,7,6,Ngf6,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p2nb1/8/4P1P1/2N2N1P/PPP1BP2/R1BK3R w kq -',I was not too happy about this move. My knight doesn't have much places to go but I decided to play it anyway. It attacks white e-pawn.
276,7,7,Nxe4,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p3b1/8/4n1P1/2N1BN1P/PPP1BP2/R2K3R w kq -',white did not defend the pawn so I take it. I decided to take with my knight because my bishop was more valuable.
277,7,8,1Nxe4,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p3b1/8/4N1P1/4BN1P/PPP1BP2/R2K3R b kq -',white decided to trade pieces. I think that is acceptable here.
278,7,9,1Rg1,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/4b1P1/4BN1P/PPP1BP2/R2K2R1 b kq -',White did not want to have his rook pinned and probably wanted to play with his knight. Ng5 would be a strong move thats why I played h6.
279,7,10,1c3,b'r3kb1r/pp1nppp1/2p4p/8/4b1P1/2P1BN1P/PP2BP2/R2K2R1 b kq -',White now wanted to move his queen side pawns. That is a bad idea because he does not have a strong attack with it and it weakens white's defense. Meanwhile I decide to continue development and castling.
280,7,11,1Ke1,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1p2p/8/4b1P1/2P1BN1P/PP2BP2/R3K1R1 b kq -',White wants to use the d-file for the rook.
281,7,12,Rd8,b'3rk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/8/4b1P1/2P1BN1P/PP2BP2/3RK1R1 w k -',I need to do this move before I castle. If I don't he plays the simple Rxd7. Also if white plays Bxa7 I would play b6 and the bishop has a problem.
282,7,13,1Bd4,b'3rk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/8/3Bb1P1/2P2N1P/PP2BP2/3RK1R1 b k -',he attacks the g-pawn but this allows me to finish my opening by castling.
283,7,14,1Nd2,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/8/3Bb1P1/2P4P/PP1NBP2/3RK1R1 b - -',White attacks my bishop. I was thinking about f5 but I decided to play it easy.
284,7,15,1Bc2,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/8/3B2P1/2P4P/PPbNBP2/3RK1R1 w - -',I decided to move my bishop away. This is a move to put white's rook off the strong d-file.
285,7,16,Bg6,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1bp/8/3B2P1/2P4P/PP1NBP2/2R1K1R1 w - -',This is better than moving the bishop to g6 on the 17th move because now the rook is off the d-file and it takes another move to get it back there.
286,7,17,1b4,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1bp/8/1P1B2P1/2P4P/P2NBP2/2R1K1R1 b - b3',but white decides to play with his queen-side pawns.
287,7,18,1c5,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4p1bp/2p5/1P1B2P1/2P4P/P2NBP2/2R1K1R1 w - -',I felt this was a strong move because my pieces would be more active after bxc5 Bxc5.
288,7,19,2Be3,b'3r1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4p1bp/2p5/1P4P1/2P1B2P/P2NBP2/2R1K1R1 b - -',white did not take

291,7,22,Bxb4,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/4p1bp/8/1b4P1/2P1B2P/3NBP2/2R1K1R1 w - -',white's pawn is pinned so white lost another pawn.
292,7,23,2Bd4,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/4p1bp/8/1b1B2P1/2P4P/3NBP2/2R1K1R1 b - -',this is another bad move.
293,7,24,2e5,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/6bp/4p3/1b1B2P1/2P4P/3NBP2/2R1K1R1 w - -',This is the time where white didn't see any hopefull things. But continued playing with a good move.
294,7,25,2Nb3,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/6bp/4p3/1b1B2P1/1NP4P/4BP2/2R1K1R1 b - -',This move is good because it defends the rook! If I play exd4 then cxb4 and the rook is not pinned anymore
295,7,26,2Ba3,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/6bp/4p3/3B2P1/bNP4P/4BP2/2R1K1R1 w - -',I decided to attack the rook
296,7,27,2Rc2,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/6bp/4p3/3B2P1/bNP4P/2R1BP2/4K1R1 b - -',And this is where white made his mistake. He forgot about my bishop on g6 and after I pointed my finger to my bishop he resigned.
297,7,28,2Bxc2,b'2r2rk1/pp1n1pp1/7p/4p3/3B2P1/bNP4P/2b1BP2/4K1R1 w - -',However I wonder what would have happened after Ra1 then my a7 pawn would be attacked and white may still have a bit of a game. But he would have lost his bishop after Ra1 Bb2 Rxa7 exd4.
298,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',When I first learned to play I learned to start with e4. But there is so much material to learn for the Sicilian that I decided with my coaches encouragement to change to d4 and later to c4 as my opening. I do not like to play e4 against players rated over 1600 but I feel I must do so as a surprise sometimes. 
299,8,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move puts us either into the two Knights or four Knights and I am very comfortable with those. I am also comfortable with Bc5 and the the Evans Gambit. Too bad I didn't get to play that here.
300,8,2,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I rarely play the Scotch but my coach has encouraged me to do so and I recently spent 4 hours of training on the opening with my coach so I decided to play it for the experience.
301,8,3,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4P3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is a  safer line in my opinion than the Scotch Gambit.
302,8,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',exf6 is just not sound and retreating the Bishop to b3 is good but it does not seem to be in the spirit of this opening. so I choose to try and keep pressure on my opponents.
303,8,5,Nd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1B1pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The first move I feel that really required some thought. This breaks the pin and starts an attack on the e5 pawn but it is a bit ugly. Now the Bishop on c8 is a prisoner.
304,8,6,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/2n5/1B1pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Opening theory has several options here. I could certainly exchange the Knight on c6 but the pawn structure hasn't been settled yet and it could open up. I will hold onto the Bishop pair just a bit longer to see how things unfold.
305,8,7,Bxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/2B5/3pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',This is why I have trouble with correspondence chess. Sometimes you forget your plans from the day before. I should have continued to develop. But I forgot my plan to keep the Bishop pair and I noticed I could get my pawn back without any trouble so I did so.
306,8,8,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/2p5/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',This is Black's first really hard decision. I have taken us out of book with my mix-up but Black must figure out what to do about the pawn on c6. I understand this move but I think Nb8 is more accurate. It allows the Bishop to develop to a much better square. I think this Bishop stayed stuck for quite some time.
307,8,9,1Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/2p5/3pPN2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',I considered Nc3 and Bf5 but I realized that the Bishop is already developed in this case. I am going to attack the King and the Bishop can get there as easily from c1 as from any place else. I did not like Nc3 because it didn't support my idea of a King side attack. I think I missed the idea of Nd2 with Nf3 to follow but it looked ugly to Block my Bishop and it seemed to take a long time for my attack to develop if I started with Nd2.
308,8,10,1Qg4,b'r2qr1k1/pbpnbppp/2p5/3pPN2/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',Okay
309,8,11,1g6,b'r2qr1k1/pbpnbp1p/2p3p1/3pPN2/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',Okay...this is a mistake. The King will become exposed. I am going to have a very strong attack based on the calculation Nh6+ Kg7 Nxf7 Kxf7 e6+! Kg8 exd7 which opens the King up for an attack and wins a pawn. I don't think we need to calculate beyond Nh6+ Kh8 we all know the Black Queen would be lost.
310,8,12,Kg7,b'r2qr3/pbpnb1kp/2p1P1p1/3p4/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',Okay...so Kg7...I missed this possible move. But the effect is the same.
311,8,13,1Qh3,b'r2q1r2/pbpPb1kp/2p3p1/3p4/8/7Q/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',Maybe I should have developed the Knight instead but I just saw the King and Rook lined up on that diagonal and I just didn't feel I was losing too much time setting up the possible tactic. It couldn' lose too much time because Black must prevent the tactic before he can start his own operations.
312,8,14,1Qb3,b'r2q4/pbpPb1kp/2p3p1/3p1r2/8/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',Again...loose pieces...but here is where I should have been developing. This was just plain bad. Bh6+ develops with tempi...I see it now but I missed it during the game.
313,8,15,2Qb3,b'r2q4/pbpP2kp/2p3p1/2b2r2/3p4/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',hmmm...perhaps I helped Black here a bit...Again I missed an opportunity to develop.
314,8,16,2Qxb7,b'r7/pQpq2kp/2p3p1/2b2r2/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',Qxb7??...what a blunder! I had a comfortable lead and I didn't take time to calculate Black's possible responses.
315,8,17,2Re8,b'4r3/pQpq2kp/2p3p1/2b2r2/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - -',My back rank is weak and all because I wasted so much time not developing. Then when I made my error I completely lost control of the position.
316,8,18,2Qxc7+,b'4q3/p1Q3kp/2p3p1/2b2r2/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB3K1 b - -',What can I do? I need time to regroup my pieces I am getting ready to resign. I can't cover my back or second rank sufficiently and Qa5 can't work because of d3 and the threat of Bxf2+ winning the Queen.
317,8,19,2Rf7,b'4q3/p1Q2rkp/2p3p1/2b5/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB3K1 w - -',Black has given me a break. Kg8 keeps the pressure on. You see the Rook on f5 prevents the Queen from going back to a5 because of discovered attacks available.
318,8,20,2Bd2,b'4q3/p4rkp/2p3p1/Q1b5/8/3p4/PPPB1PPP/RN4K1 b - -',Okay...it is bad but I am starting to rebuild. e1 is now safe...the problem is the Knight on b2 and the Rook on a1. If I solve them both I can equalize.
319,8,21,2Bxf2+,b'4q3/p4rkp/2p3p1/Q7/8/3p4/PPPB1bPP/RN4K1 w - -',I am not being given any breathing room. This move really keeps the pressure on.
320,8,22,Qe2,b'8/p4rkp/2p3p1/Q7/8/3p4/PPPBqbPP/RN5K w - -',Wow...The King on g7 and not g8 is the only opportunity for me to solve my problem.
321,8,23,2Nd2,b'8/p4r1p/2p3pk/Q7/8/2Bp4/PPPNqbPP/R6K b - -',With the tempi gained I secure my back rank.
322,8,24,2h3,b'8/p4r1p/2p3pk/Q7/8/2Bp3P/PPPNq1P1/R3b2K b - -',Finally I can open a small back door for my King.
323,8,25,2dxc2,b'8/p4r1p/2p3pk/Q7/8/2B4P/PPpNq1P1/R3b2K w - -',Well...this looks threatening but it is wrong. Black has lost control of the game now. White is still that Bishop that was captured at the wrong time up and Black needs to change his mind set and go for the draw by repetition. Rf1+ Nxf1 Qxf1+ Kg2 Qf4+ and its a draw.
324,8,26,3Qa4,b'8/p4r1p/2p3pk/8/Q7/2B4P/PPpNq1P1/R3b2K b - -',Now there is no draw available
325,8,27,3g5,b'8/p4r1p/2p4k/6p1/Q7/2B4P/PPpNq1P1/R3b2K w - -',This is the last real mistake. The King can be checked with the capture of the pawn and White's pieces suddenly have a serious attack.
326,8,28,Bxc3,b'8/p4r1p/2Q5/6pk/8/2b2N1P/PPp1q1P1/R6K w - -',After taking the Bishop here Black realized that g4 was mate and resigned. But I think I had good control at this point...alternative moves seem to allow White to simplify the position or hold onto the lead.
327,9,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',This has fallen out of fashion a while ago because it theoretically allows black to equalize immediately with the tal gambit by 2...d5 however I had a specific variation in mind
328,9,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The opening begins with this strange looking gambit. I guess it could be something of reversed Budapest in which white has used the extra tempo to play f2-f4 and it is unclear weather this helps or hurts whites cause
329,9,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This obvious attack on the f7 square can be easily dispelled with the simple ...e6 and it may be best in that case white will eventually get back the e pawn and it will be roughly an equal game however with blacks next move it shows that my opponent intends to go all out for the win.
330,9,3,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The perfect way to take advantage of whites earlier f4. Now if white wants to get anything out of the position a queen sac is practically forced and yet this is exactly what I had been hoping for from move 1
331,9,4,Qxg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Though this may appear quite extraordinary for those who have not seen this particular line before I can say that this position has Infact been seen many a time before especially here on gameknot. Although there is still plenty of speculation As to the soundness of this sacrifice i can say my personal opinion is that it is sound and perfectly playable providing white with adequate compensation for the queenas well I know that quite a few other people who have done some work into this line have also attested to the general soundness of the queen sac. Actually this is probably whites most accurate move so far this game
332,9,5,Kc6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k1B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Kc7 is also possible as well however that after the bishop takes the knight a royal fork is threatened and black must move the queen to avoid it. Of course this is the more human move and is my personal preference 
333,9,6,Bxg4,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The smoke has cleared and white has two pieces for the queen as well as other advantages to sweeten the deal as for the developmental situation on move 9 we have white having developed a bishop and knight and black having developed the king.
334,9,7,e6,b'rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/2k1p3/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',This is probably where black has to make a real decision most of the moves up to here have been fairly obvious. There are several possibilities at this point though I feel that this may be the best bet for black at this point we are still well within established theory
335,9,8,1a3,b'r2q1b1r/pp4pp/n1k1p3/2p3N1/4pPB1/P1N5/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',As in Mackenzie-Pruess Reno 06 and in gameknots Dana-Freddy. The beauty of this gambit is that is that whites strategy is not usually about launching a fierce attack against the centre strewn king but instead white usually aims to restrict blacks pieces especially the queen well white will look to maintain piece coordination. Because of this white can afford to make slow restricting moves as this one.
336,9,9,1Bd6,b'r2q3r/pp4pp/n1kbp3/2p3N1/4pPB1/P1N5/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Dana-Freddy continued 11...Qd4 12.Nxe6 Qd7 which ran into 13.d4!! And white had an excellent attack 
337,9,10,Rf8,b'r2q1r2/ppn3pp/2kbp3/2p3N1/4NPB1/P7/1PPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',And now we have the first deviation from Mackenzie-Pruess That game continued with ...Qe7 and white eventually went on to win. From this point I'm on my own.
338,9,11,1d3,b'r2q1r2/ppn3pp/2kbp3/2p3N1/4NPB1/P2P4/1PP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',And already one move on my own and I may have made a slip up. There were a number of principles developed for these types of positions and one of those principles is that given the chance white should look for opportunities to exchange a knight for bishop and here is a perfect opportunity to do so. 
339,9,12,1Nxe6,b'r2q1r2/ppn3p1/2kbN2p/2p5/4NPB1/P2P4/1PP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Even here instead of going after the pawn it may have been best to rid black of his his bishop. After 15. Nxd6 Qxd6 16.Ne4 white seems to keeping thins together. A computer may disagree with my analysis however computers don't really understand these positions. Having said that 16...Qe4+ 17.Kh1 g5 does give black very annoying unitive which is not something that white wants to allow so maybe this is alright
340,9,13,Be5,b'r2q1r2/pp4p1/2k1B2p/2p1b3/4NP2/P2P4/1PP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I overlooked this actually taking the bishop is a no go for white since it runs in to all sorts of trouble after ...Qd4+
341,9,14,1Rf3,b'r2q1r2/pp4p1/2k1B2p/2p1b3/4NP2/P2P1R2/1PP3PP/R1B3K1 b - -',The computer doesn't seem to like this move and gives the position as less than1 for black after 17.a4 providing the following line 17.a4 Bd4+ 18.Kh1 a6 19.c3 Be5 20.Rf3 Qh4 21.Be3 Bxf4 22.g3 Qe7 23.Bxc5 Qe6 24.Bxf8 Rxf8 25.Rxf4 Rxf4 26.gxf4 Which seems maybe alright however it looks like black is going to be able to seriously disrupt all those pawns. However to be honest I don't really understand why a4 is the suggestion here is it just to prevent black getting in b5 or something?
342,9,15,1Be3,b'r4r2/pp4p1/2k1B2p/2p1b3/4NP1q/P2PBR2/1PP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Effectively forced however I didn't mind giving up pawns I already sacrificed my queen so a couple extra pawns don't mean much
343,9,16,Kc7,b'r4r2/ppk3p1/4B2p/8/2PpNP1q/P2P1R2/6PP/1R4K1 w - -',I don't really understand the reasoning behind this move either It seems that black could be improving the position of the pieces here not moving the king to a square that appears to be even worse than the square it was already on since now it is liable to checks 
344,9,17,2Nc5,b'1r3r2/ppk3p1/7p/2NB4/2Pp1P1q/P2P1R2/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',More pressure on b7 and I'm also threatning a fork on e6
345,9,18,2Rg3,b'1r2r3/ppk3p1/7p/2NB4/2Pp1P1q/P2P2R1/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',I felt this move put up the most resistance
346,9,19,2f5,b'1r2r3/ppk5/7p/2NB1Pp1/2Pp3q/P2P2R1/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',This pawn is now a passed pawn and after all passed pawns must be pushed! It's a bonus that the promotion square is also forking square 
347,9,20,2f6,b'1r6/ppk5/5P1p/2NB2p1/2Pp3q/P2Pr1R1/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',Passed pawns must be pushed
348,9,21,2f7,b'1r6/ppk2P2/7p/2NB2p1/2Pp4/P2P2q1/6P1/1R4K1 b - -',Passed pawns must be pushed!
349,9,22,h5,b'1r6/ppk2P2/8/2NB2pp/2Pp4/P2Pq3/6P1/1R5K w - -',The computer calls this move an inaccuracy and now thinks that after 30.Rxb7+ black has to go for are perpetual check. Actually I though that at this point I could Play 30.Na6+ however the problem is blacks queen can cover the promotion square for example ...bxa6 Rxb8 Qc1+ Kh2 Qf4+ and only then does black capture my rook.
350,9,23,Rh8,b'7r/pR3P2/3kN3/3B2pp/2Pp4/P2Pq3/6P1/7K w - -',Now I can no longer keep the threat of promotion I have to promote now 
351,9,24,3f8=B+,b'5B1r/pR6/3kN3/3B2pp/2Pp4/P2Pq3/6P1/7K b - -',My own personal sense of humor if given the chance I will always under promote if it doesn't hurt my position 
352,9,25,3Rxf8,b'5r2/pR6/3kN3/3B2pp/2Pp4/P2Pq3/6P1/7K w - -',Of course black still snatches it off
353,9,26,3Rf7,b'5q2/p4R2/3k4/3B2pp/2Pp4/P2P4/6P1/6K1 b - -',A bit of a misstep Rxa7 was clearly the better move
354,9,27,3Kh2,b'8/pR6/3k4/6pp/q1PpB3/P2P4/6PK/8 b - -',Getting off the back rank 
355,9,28,4c5+,b'8/p7/3k4/1RP3pp/3pB3/3P4/6PK/2q5 b - -',Passed pawns must be pushed 
356,9,29,4c6,b'8/p7/2P1k3/1R4pp/3pB3/3P4/6PK/2q5 b - -',Passed pawns must be pushed
357,9,30,4h4,b'8/p7/2P1k3/1R4p1/3pB2p/3P4/6PK/2q5 w - -',In the mean time black continues to push foward in a systematic manner eventually the g pawn is going to come to g3 and leave me stuck on the back rank it was only now that I realized just how dire my position was
358,9,31,4Kh1,b'8/p7/2P1k3/R5p1/3pBq1p/3P4/6P1/7K b - -',Probably g1 was a better square since it denies the queen access to f2
359,9,32,4Ra1,b'8/8/2P1k3/8/3pBq1p/3P2p1/6P1/R6K b - -',Now my rook is confined to the back rank and I clearly have no winning chances sine the king will always be able to prevent my pawn from promoting though at this point I didn't see blacks exact winning method yet so I played on to see how black would finish it off
360,9,33,h3,b'8/8/2Pk4/8/3pBq2/3P2pp/6P1/1R5K w - -',The problem is that black will eventually win d3 and I will have two passed pawns to contend with.
361,9,34,4Rg1,b'8/8/2Pk4/8/3pBq2/3P2pp/6P1/6RK b - -',This is just a blunder

But if he wishes to succeed with his own attack he will have to detail at least one piece for that purpose. What is his plan of attack in the present circumstances? The only possible one is to advance the RP and exchange it for the QNP; then he will occupy the QR file with a Rook and attack the QNP with R and B. It is possible to calculate exactly the number of moves required in this process. That number is 4 moves; on the 5th move the QNP will be attacked twice. Now what of White? Again there is only one possible plan: the opening of the KN file. This will also require 4 moves but on the 4th move the KBP will already be under attack.

Black had this tactical opportunity and failed to take it. Either he did not see it or he underestimated the dangers of the situation or he lacked the pluck to make the sacrifice.

White chooses to develop the knight here as opposed to its 'classical' square so that d4 can be thoroughly reinforced by c3 and potentially Ndf3 and Nge2 and of course if black plays ...c5 immediately then the idea is to straddle black with an isolated queens pawn then play against that

The point is that this allows for the DSB to develop freely and neither the black knight or the black LSB will need to make use of d7 so the queen is not blocking anything from this square. Though if I were in blacks position I think I would prefer to place the queen back on her home square since it seems to me at least that the dark squares will be of more consequence

816,20,13,Bxe5,b'3r1rk1/pbq2ppp/1p2pn2/4b3/3R1B2/2P5/PPB1QPPP/R5K1 w - -',?! Giving up the bishop pair in an open position like this for no apparent compensation doesn't seem like a wise choice. However looking back at the position I notice that whites logical play so far has left white In a position where the pieces are controlling more space and the knight standing proudly on e5 leaves a nice impression he was also preventing black from doubling rooks and because of all this it is quite hard to suggest a good plan for black so I guess it's understandable that black wanted to initiate  some exchanges leaving black with a less cramped slightly more manageable position
817,20,14,2f3,b'3r1rk1/pb3ppp/1pq1pn2/4B3/3R4/2P2P2/PPB1Q1PP/R5K1 b - -',Black does not have a DSB anymore so it is unlikely that he will be able to take advantage of the opened up diagonal to my king so this move blunts the black battery and gives my king quicker access to the centre when the endgame rolls around. It may also be an alternate route for my queen to get to the kingside at some point 
818,20,15,Rd8,b'3r2k1/pb3ppp/1pq1pn2/8/3B4/2P2P2/PPB1Q1PP/R5K1 w - -',So now after a couple of exchanges we can see whites bishops doing a marvellous job directed ominously at the black monarch. White retains a very small but slightly annoying edge
819,20,16,2Rd1,b'3r2k1/pb3ppp/1pq1pn2/8/3B4/2P2P2/PPB1Q1PP/3R2K1 b - -',Contesting the only open file
820,20,17,2Kf8,b'3r1k2/pb3ppp/1pq1pn2/8/3B4/2P2P2/PPB1Q1PP/3R2K1 w - -',? Black starts creeping his king closer to the centre of the board however the queens are still on the board and as such this is not yet an endgame. This could lose a pawn to 23.Bxf6 followed by Bxh7 however I decide to go down a different path. But then it is hard to suggest an alternative plan for black clearly black should try to exchange one of whites bishops but there are no obvious ways to do that further more blacks minor pieces can't seem to find any useful roles since the f3 pawn both blunts blacks bishop and takes away squares from the knight
821,20,18,2Qe5,b'3r1k2/pb3ppp/1pq1pn2/4Q3/3B4/2P2P2/PPB3PP/3R2K1 b - -',As said in the previous diagram I could have won a pawn here however I felt this was a better approach. After 23.Bxf6 gxf6 24.Bxh7 f5 white has given up the bishop pair and turned the remaining bishop into an inactive piece that may even find itself trapped in short I felt black got far more play for the pawn than was necessary to be allowed  
822,20,19,2Qg3,b'3r4/pb2kppp/1pq1pn2/8/3B4/2P2PQ1/PPB3PP/3R2K1 b - -',This leaves white with a very large advantage however it turns out that Qg5 should have been deceive. I fact I'm not sure why I played this move instead especially since It involves moving my queen backward diagonally to a square she is a little less active 
823,20,20,2Bxh7,b'3rn3/pb2kppB/1pq1p3/8/3B4/2P2PQ1/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - -',Now that black gets nothing for it I decide to snatch the pawn
824,20,21,2Bd3,b'3rn3/pb2k1p1/1p2pp2/1q6/3B4/2PB1PQ1/PP1R2PP/6K1 b - -',Bg6 was my first thought looking to remove the knight which is the glue holding blacks position together however I decided to first throw in a zwishenzug to get the to a slightly less active square 
825,20,22,2a4,b'3r4/pb2k1p1/1p1nppB1/q7/P2B4/2P2PQ1/1P1R2PP/6K1 b - a3',Once again my first thought was to move my bishop so as to start attacking blacks position however I decided to throw in another zwishenzug. This move gains queenside space and also takes away a few squares from the black queen. I can also follow up with b4 where the queen is basically out of useful squares since g5 would be the only safe square however that allows white to further break down blacks position liquidating into an easily winning endgame
826,20,23,2Qxa4,b'3r4/pb2k1p1/1p1nppB1/8/q2B4/2P2PQ1/1P1R2PP/6K1 w - -',?? This surprised me that black would make this sudden blunder now he must give up the queen in order to avoid mate the point is that white now gets to move the bishop with tempo
827,20,24,3Bxf6+,b'3r4/pb2kqQ1/1p1npB2/8/8/2P2P2/1PBR2PP/6K1 b - -',Anyway hope you enjoyed probably one of my most well executed methodical wins to date if you don't mind a always enjoy a couple of comments.
828,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

As you know I enjoy challenging Experts Masters and Grandmasters.  So does Woustra!  He has now started to challenge much higher rated players and he found me!  As I have been there and done it all the only advice I can give to Woustra is to stick at it even though he may well get stung for quite a few games to come.  However those games where he gives the likes of us a run for our money ""e.g. lasting 30 or 40 moves before losing material"" will gradually start to creep in and then eventually the odd Expert or even Master Draw.  If that happens Woustra do stick that result on your profile wall - that will remind you that you can hold your own with the big guns.  This game proved to be a Baptism of Fire for Woustra and lasted 20 moves and here is the computer analysis:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18421819&rnd=0.031244238702234583"
829,21,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',1. ..... e5 - here we have a double king pawn opening.  Good start Woustra.
830,21,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. ..... Nf6 - the Petrov's Defense.  Not a bad idea.  Develops a piece and counter-attacks my e4 pawn.
831,21,3,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3. ...... d6 - this is the best move.  This will drive back my knight and black will win my e4 pawn back on the next turn.  This will result (as does the French Exchange Variation) in the opening of the e column early in the game.  As the two kings are in the centre both sides must watch out for pieces being in an absolute pin (the piece will not be able to move legally as it will expose the king to check) against their king.  These pieces will be very vulnerable to attack by pawn stabs and will therefore be lost.  Sadly that was exactly what happened to Woustra in this game.  So Woustra - Lesson 1 - look out for pins on the e column and pieces lined up against your king particularly your queen.
832,21,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ...... d5 - a good enough move as it opens up black's light square bishop and it gives black's steed a toe-hold in the centre.  However as in my previous note - that black knight is on the same line as his king on the open e column!
833,21,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn1b1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',6. ..... Bg4 - this is a reasonable move a developing move followed by a pin.  But now I land him a counter-pin on that e column - from Glenda!
834,21,6,Bxf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B1b2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',7. ..... Bxf3?? - this move gets a double question mark because I will not recapture the bishop with Glenda.  I am quite happy for my kingside pawn structure to be busted because I will net a whole piece on that open e column.  When the g pawn recaptures it will stab at the pinned knight on the e column.  As you will see ......
835,21,7,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3Pn3/3B1P2/PPP1QP1P/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',8. ...... Nc6 - a good developing move and hitting out at my pawn on d4.  However that steed is gonna get pinned and I am gonna return the compliment - on the queenside.
836,21,8,Bb5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1p4/3Pn3/5P2/PPP1QP1P/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',9. Bb5 - comme ca!
837,21,9,Be7,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/1B1p4/3Pn3/5P2/PPP1QP1P/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',9. ...... Be7 - black gets his pieces out very quickly.  Although the pin is now broken I do not take the knight immediately because I know that the knight on e4 does not protect the knight on c6 so I first take the knight on c6 with check.  Again Ion - I still cannot resist this B for N exchange!
838,21,10,1fxe4,b'r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP1QP1P/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',11. fxe4 - now I take the knight.
839,21,11,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP1QP1P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',11. ..... 0-0 - black sensibly castles and now Henry and Glenda are vulnerable to a pin on the e column.  I do not wish to play 0-0 here because Henry will feel very chilly on the g column and Glenda his other half is a little too far away to provide him with those fur pelts and medieval stockings!
840,21,12,1Nc3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP1QP1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',12. Nc3 - I realise that my queenside is undeveloped.  I have decided to put Henry on the queenside.  I must get those pieces out fast.  Whenever I get an opponent whatever his rating I analyse the board as though I was playing the Master Mater.  This move defends the e4 pawn.
841,21,13,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N1B3/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R b KQ -',13. Be3 - again I decided to continue with my development.  I decided to eschew the pawn recapture as that e pawn blocks the e column preventing a pin on Glenda and Fou Lenoir.  Henry is now able to castle kingside.
842,21,14,1Qc4,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2b2/8/2QPp3/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',14. Qc4 - my c4 pawn is twice attacked so Glenda defends it.  I am not prepared to return a second pawn for my piece.  Glenda also hits out at the pawn on c6.
843,21,15,1Qxc5,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/5b2/2Q5/3Pp3/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',15. Qxc5 - now a pawn drops but not the e4 pawn.  I am now a clear piece up.  Should I go for an attack on the king or should I go for the slow torture exchanging down until I get into a pawn ending with my extra piece?  I end up steering a mid-course with my next move.
844,21,16,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/5b2/p1QN4/3Pp3/4B3/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',16. Nd5 - I think I will go for the bishop on f6.  I will let black believe that I may take the c7 pawn.  I will not though because my c2 pawn will be hanging on the c file should Glenda be skewered by a black rook on c8.  Although black can recapture the bishop with his queen that is another set of pieces exchanged and my advantage will be increased still further.
845,21,17,gxf6,b'r2q1rk1/5p1p/2p2p2/p1Q5/3Pp3/4B3/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',17. ...... gxf6?? - this move is an outright blunder because it opens up the g column right onto the BK and I have a WR able to move onto that file and give check.  Lesson 2 - Do not expose your king to attack in this way unnecessarily.  Although black's position is still dire being a clear piece down Qf6 will enable him to carry on playing and attempt to get some counterplay on the h8-a1 diagonal where Henry will want to castle.  However I do not want the BK to go to h8 and then black move his rook to g8.  No how can I stop this?  The answer is .........
846,21,18,1Bh6,b'r2q1rk1/5p1p/2p2p1B/p1Q5/3Pp3/8/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',18. Bh6 - deadly.  Black cannot avoid the loss of further material.  Black tries to avoid it but runs into .........
847,21,19,2Bg7+,b'r2qr2k/5pBp/2p2p2/p1Q5/3Pp3/8/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',20. Bg7+ ...... wait for it ......
848,21,20,2Kg8,b'r2qr1k1/5pBp/2p2p2/p1Q5/3Pp3/8/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 w Q -',20. ....

Amazing Henry is still in the centre of the board but he is perfectly safe while the castled black king perishes on the g column.  Chess is a funny game as no doubt you the Inquest Jury will agree.

White's response to a5 should be Bc6 which places the white-squared bishop on a POST maintaining the PIN on the knight and ATTACKING the rook at a8.
---
A further in-depth reasoning on my analysis:
-----
The BEST move for this turn was Qxe4. a TEMPI was expended on the black queen as she took advantage of the kingside vulnerability and placed the White king in CHECK. As such this was a BEST move for Black with Maximum TEMPI for that turn. White was FORCED to expend a TEMPI and move the king also a BEST move. As such no gain in TEMPI for either player. Of course since we know the king is not to be MATED then the real PURPOSE of Qh4+ was to reclaim the White pawn at e4. So this is really a 2 part move sequence if you will that justifies the expenditure of using two TEMPI on the queen. Keep in mind that COMMON CHESS SENSE warns against moving the queen out in the game early not just because it becomes an object of ATTACK by lesser pieces but following the idea of TEMPI reveals that each TIME a piece is moved another TEMPI is expended; and the queen can become a target of multiple ATTACKS and consequently ends up moving several times at the expense of DEVELOPING other pieces. This also goes back to the other COMMON CHESS SENSE warning that a player should refrain as much as possible from moving a piece more than once in the OPENING stage of the game. --- Keeping in mind that all moves in chess have a PURPOSE we are actively seeking out the BEST CANDIDATE for move selection on each turn. I can speculate why Black chose to play a3 however we have to first ask if a3 has as many positive ATTRIBUTES as Qxe4. Yes a3 ATTACKS the White bishop thereby FORCING white to REACT however the negative of that move is that it allowed White to improve the bishop's position without White having to expend a TEMPI of his own (because it was a FORCED move) and it created a further weakness in Black's position. Therefore due to Black choosing a Less than BEST move and White responding with a BEST move White gained a further increase in TEMPI = INITIATIVE = ATTACK."

Board Overview:

Black cannot move the king-side knight; the queen-side knight is PINNED. The white-squared bishop is TRAPPED and unable to move; The black-squared bishop must RETREAT; the queen is out of position. It's only Move 10 and Black is in trouble.

On the other side white has an exposed king Two DOUBLED CENTRE pawns and with the exception of the white-squared bishop has no other pieces DEVELOPED. However because Black lacks TEMPI he cannot take advantage of White's weaknesses."

If White is planning to ATTACK the knight then he needs to assess what his options are.

As long as the knight is PINNED the knight is in jeopardy. Therefore it follows that the reason for the PIN needs to be resolved OR the cause of the PIN needs to be addressed.

Kf8 breaks the PIN or Bb7 ATTACKS the bishop.

A5 has to be an error as it lacks the ATTRIBUTES of either Kf8 or Bb7 nor does it immediately act on the on-going situation at hand. I suspect Black has a reason behind the move maybe even a plan but he lacks TEMPI and without it he will not be able to execute his plan."

BEST Move Philosophy dictates that a player seek out the BEST move for the turn; it never encourages plays that rely on your opponent instantly going blind or stupid. If we are crossing our fingers or making silent prayers in hope that a player will become bedazzled we are no longer playing good chess.

I give black credit for seeing the possible MATE however his failure to address the gravity of his position may cost a further loss of TEMPI and degradation of his position should his opponent discover it.

It may take a long job with the centre fixed with black pawns but maybe a rook lift from a1-e1 - h3 or g3 could be an idea.  I execute it later on only to be bogged down by Old Matey patrolling my back row.

The only thing was and this is something to beware of especially when you are playing a lot of games with problematical moves to think about it can be sooo easy to switch off from a game where your opponent takes a few days to make a move.  When you come back to the board even though you may have calculated the correct move it can be easy to go wrong.  Lesson 2 - if you do put it in your notes check your notes every time you are about to make your move.  It may prevent you from making Yours Truly's mistake.

The threat here is Rxg6+ as the f7 pawn is pinned to the rook on f8 and my rook on f1 can then join in the attack on the denuded BK after Glenda removes the rook on f8 with check.  I would have liked to have played Rh3 here (threatening Rh8#) but after seeing a grinning Old Matey point his skeletal like finger towards g2 that move is out of the question sigh and double sigh!

I am now up in material and at least I have a potential Glenda 2 on the d column.  But will that potential be realised?  We shall see.  Note that that capture on a6 was only possible because Glenda (known as Glenda the Defender) poor put upon lady defends the rook on f1.

That pawn on f7 has been menaced for some time.  It will survive however and this pawn will be instrumental in me conceding that low draw!

983,26,31,4d7,b'4r1k1/3P4/4p1p1/8/8/7P/6P1/R6K b - -',42. d7?? - this miscalculation seals my fate.  If Henry had been on the third rank I might have had the tempi to swipe black's pawns and crown my own.  But Henry is still on the first rank and in the endgame that is bad.

985,26,33,4Kf4,b'8/3k4/4p1p1/8/5K2/7P/6P1/8 b - -',47. Kf4 - As I now know the position is drawn and my opponent is now visiting the board daily I now decided to bite the bullet.  I now plumb in some conditional moves and at the end of the conditional moves my opponent offered me a draw.  I accepted because I knew it would result in me and Tamas having just our bare kings.  On the minus side I should have won this game hands down and gained 7 rating points instead of losing 3.  If I am to reach Expertdom of which I was only 44 points away from this game shows that there is much room for improvement for Yours Truly.  On the plus side no doubt it has had you the Inquest Jury sitting on the edge of your seats in the latter part of this game.  Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read and are enjoying your weekend.  I now need to beat Tamas in my return game against him to get first place in the MT.  I just hope I have the focus and concentration to do it.

Maybe this wasn't the correct response however the idea seemed appealing the point was to allow lines where black can check the on b6 without having to worry about white playing a knight to a4 and of course the other main idea is to win a pawn in some lines by b4 followed by Nxd4

However I played it as more of a psychological weapon it says to white you can't kick my knight out so easily

The sacrifice is bad enough as it is however even if I do want to sac a piece it should have been the knight that I sacrificed not the bishop. However the main idea behind the sacrifice was to leave white in a position where it is very difficult to develop and coordinate the pieces I thought by having my knight on g4 white would have a difficult time however I guess I just got lazy and didn't put enough thought into it. Because white has a reasonably easy game after this.

In retrospect i think this was simply not productive. It also creates a target at d6.

However with soon to be doubled up rooks that is not enough. I also have to be slightly weary of my rook which now has limited mobility. However that is not a primary issue as of now.

Looking back i think that i still had a slight advantage but at the time i was intimidated by His newly acquired queen on an open board. If i had a bishop pair rather than the Knight i would of been far more comfortable. Ultimately i think i played too passive and i think i shouldn't have been as intimidated at this position props to my opponent for staying in the game. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

The positions are easier to analyze and that is why I chose to use it. My friend Sunshine94558 (on gameknott) has played this against me when she played Black and I do not like to play against it.
1209,33,3,dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/4p3/1P6/4PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',With all of his pawn moves white has given away a bit of his edge in development.
1210,33,4,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/4p3/1P6/2P1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now  this is a mistake. Black's Bishop belongs on b2 and he should have played this to c4. The Knight on b1 has nowhere to go that is helpful and he has now just blocked the development of his c1 Bishop. He is moving pawns and neglecting his development. He is also no closer to castling.
1211,33,5,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/8/1P2p3/2P1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I decide that I want to get more space in the center. This makes him move the Knight again keeps his pawn on e3 which blocks the c1 Bishop and he does not have time to develop any more pieces.

You see my pawn is supposed to be on e5 and it isn't. The Old Indian has one real strategy problem...It has a traffic jam in the middle becuase the pawns block the pieces. I do not have that problem because my opponent took on e5 and because I was able to play e4. But I still need to control the center and I need to control b5 so this is a good move. It also let's my put my Queen somewhere safe.

When you play in tournaments you have a clock and you only have so much time but you must try to understand your opponent's move before you can find your own move. But I could not figure out this move and I think it is another waste of time.

It is normal for it to go here in the Old Indian but it looks good to create a battery with Bd6.The problem for me is that I want to develop my Bishop but no matter where he goes he can be traded for White's Knight.
1215,33,9,1Nf5,b'r1b1k2r/ppqnbppp/2p2n2/5N2/1P2p3/2P1P3/P2QBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',White continues to move the same piece over and over in the opening. I could not believe his rating was over 1800.

I have the d file and all my minor pieces out. My knight on e5 is the best minor piece on the board and I can castle any time I want. But what is more important is that there is a hole in White's position. It is on d3. My coach told me that he learned from Kasparov that Knights are as strong as Rooks on the 6th or 3rd Rank. So you should put it there when you can without your opponent able to trade it away easily or when your opponent can't chase it away with a pawn.

I have to say I had no idea where this Knight would finally end up but he was able to make it better by eventually getting it to d4. However this is such a slow plan that it allows me to set up my attack on the king.
1224,33,18,2Rad1,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/5nq1/3r4/1PpNp3/P1PnP2P/1BQR1PP1/3R2K1 b - -',Again...White is still trying to find a way to deal with the Knight on d3. It has completely bottled up 4 pieces.

I saw that it was possible for White to put his Knight on f4 in a couple of moves and this is my way of stopping it. Now we can evaluate the position again. White is only defending. He has no pieces to coordinate an attack with. The Knight can not put together a serious attack by himself. Black's two Knights have effectively tied up 4 of Whites pieces. Black has put the major pieces in prime attacking position.
1227,33,21,2Ne2,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/6q1/3n2r1/1Pp1p3/P1PnP1PP/1BQRNP2/3R2K1 b - -',White is trying to find a better post for the Knight than d4 but I think he is so tied up now that there would appear to be no chance for him unless I blunder.

1231,33,25,Qxf2+,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/8/3n4/1Pp1p3/P1PRP1P1/1BQK1q1r/3R4 w - -',And mate on the next move so White resigned. The point of this review is to show the power of a knight on the 6th or 3rd rank. There they become especially powerful pieces and they can completely disrupt the coordination of your opponents pieces. Also one should understand the fact that one can survive not knowing an opening if they play for fast and active development. At my level and below it is more important to be a better middle-game and endgame player than an opening expert. I hope you enjoyed my game.
1232,34,0,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',A little passive as allowing the pawn to be taken (with for example 5. 0-0 Nxe4) offers no advantage after 6. d4 or 6. Rd1. Not a bad move but I'd prefer 0-0.
1233,34,1,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Bc5 is also good but with white having played d3 I'm thinking that c7-c5 is looking good down the line working the center and queenside.
1234,34,2,a3,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/PB1P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',And although this is fine I prefer either 0-0 c3 or Nc3 here. In many variations of the Ruy Lopez black will play Na5 trying to either force the exchange of white's bishop or allowing for the queenside expansion. White's bishop is normally dangerous in the Ruy because it winds up on the b1-h7 diagonal; but white's a3 instead of c3 prevents that.
1235,34,3,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/PB1P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',So that gives us our plan: castle protect the pawn on e5 play Na5 play c5. Let's see where that gets us.
1236,34,4,Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/PBNP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',0-0 is still good here but Nc3 is fine as well.
1237,34,5,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/PBNP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I didn't expect him to be afraid of Bg4 which is reasonable I suppose but now I get to execute my Na5 c5 plan *and* his king is still in the center.
1238,34,6,1Ba2,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/P1NP1N1P/BPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Of course the only sensible move.
1239,34,7,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/1P2P3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ b3',A reasonable move fighting back on the queenside and preventing b4 although I had no intention of playing b4.
1240,34,8,1Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Better than cxb4 12. axb4 where the knight has to retreat and white has options in deciding what to do about the b4 pawn.
1241,34,9,1Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ -',Interesting. White decides to allow black to win the b4 pawn (13... cxb4 and if 14. axb4 Nxb4 is good for black). 12. Nd5 was the way to contest it.
1242,34,10,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',And I miss it of course. This isn't necessarily the best square for the bishop even as d7 also offers promise.
1243,34,11,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Again offering the b4 pawn; Nd5 once again would have protected it.
1244,34,12,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1pp1p3/1P1nP3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',...and I miss it again. cxb4 was still better although this creates a lot of tension in the center and the knight cannot be taken without consequences.
1245,34,13,1Bxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1pp1p3/1P1BP3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Not as bad as 14. Nxd4 exd4 and white loses a piece but Bxd4 gives black a very strong presence on d4.
1246,34,14,1cxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A better capture than exd4 as this half-opens up the c-file for the rook.
1247,34,15,1Ne2,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P1N1P/B1P1NPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Pretty much the only move in town; Nd5 and Nb1 accomplish nothing good for white.
1248,34,16,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P1N1P/B1P1NPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Qd7 and Rc8 are also worth considering here. Re8 sets up the potential for d5 down the road a strike for control of the center.
1249,34,17,1Nd2,b'r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P3P/B1PNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now this is unfortunate; white simply abandons his pressure on the e5 pawn allowing black to play d5 with no consequence.
1250,34,18,1d5,b'r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/P2P3P/B1PNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',At this point I'd say black has a nice little advantage. The pressure in the center the space and the reach of his pieces are all superior to his white counterpart.
1251,34,19,1f3,b'r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/P2P1P1P/B1PNN1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Threatening to half-open the f-file if dxe4 but this has the effect of weakening the dark squares around the white king. If black can find a way to effectively attack them white could lose his king.
1252,34,20,1Rc8,b'2rqr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/P2P1P1P/B1PNN1P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And this is a threat down the c-file. The queen is now tied to the c-pawn's defense.
1253,34,21,1Bb3,b'2rqr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/PB1P1P1P/2PNN1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Giving the Queen her freedom back.
1254,34,22,1a5,b'2rqr1k1/1b2bppp/5n2/pp1pp3/1P1pP3/PB1P1P1P/2PNN1P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Threatening to drive the bishop off of b3 with a thrust to a4.
1255,34,23,1Ng3,b'2rqr1k1/1b2bppp/5n2/pp1pp3/1P1pP3/PB1P1PNP/2PN2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Another slight mistake as this does a number of bad things. First off it un-defends the c6 square which a black piece can now occupy. Second it put the knight on a light square around the white king where it's very difficult to defend. And third it allows a4 which is bad for white. bxa5 was better here but black is still up after Qxa5.
1256,34,24,1a4,b'2rqr1k1/1b2bppp/5n2/1p1pp3/pP1pP3/PB1P1PNP/2PN2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Of course.

1259,34,27,2Qc1,b'3qr1k1/1b2bppp/5n2/1p1pp3/pP1pP3/P1rP1PNP/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 b - -',"This is the end of the ""A"" -- or advantage -- stage of this game. Black doesn't exactly have a won game but with the two bishops active pieces more space and weak targets to pressure he's got a very nice advantage."
1260,34,28,2Nh5,b'3qr1k1/1b2bppp/8/1p1pp2n/pP1pP3/P1rP1PNP/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 w - -',"?? And now dreadfully he throws it away. Welcome to the ""B"" for blunder. Here have a free knight."
1261,34,29,2Nxh5,b'3qr1k1/1b2bppp/8/1p1pp2N/pP1pP3/P1rP1P1P/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 b - -',Somehow I thought the queen was protecting that knight. (How many things are wrong with that?!) At this point down a knight in material I thought about resigning. I'm clearly down. But white has plenty of weaknesses still and black has lots of pieces to pressure white with. While my last move wasn't exactly a brilliant sacrifice the d8-h4 diagonal is now open for business!
1262,34,30,2Bg5,b'3qr1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1pp1bN/pP1pP3/P1rP1P1P/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 w - -',When you're down in material one of the best strategies is to force your opponent to make difficult moves. Objectively Qc7 may have been better but this move is more threatening. If white can't find 23. f4 he could have problems holding on to his extra material.
1263,34,31,2Ng3,b'3qr1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1pp1b1/pP1pP3/P1rP1PNP/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 b - -',"? And here it is: the start of the ""C"" phase: the Comeback! f4 was much better and is the refutation of 22... Bg5 but this move allows black to claw back into the game."
1264,34,32,2Be3+,b'3qr1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1pp3/pP1pP3/P1rPbPNP/B1PN2P1/R1Q2RK1 w - -',A nasty check that makes up for the missing knight.

1266,34,34,2Qg5,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1pp1q1/pP1pP3/P1rPbPNP/B1PN2PK/R1Q2R2 w - -',Now it becomes clear how the weak dark squares hurt white. The king is in danger of getting mated the knight on d2 is as good as gone and white's queenside is trapped in a box. White must play very precisely to get out of this alive.
1267,34,35,2exd5,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1Pp1q1/pP1p4/P1rPbPNP/B1PN2PK/R1Q2R2 b - -',And this isn't it. The knight on d2 is gone but grabbing this pawn does nothing to address white's real problem: his very weak kingside.
1268,34,36,2Bxd2,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1Pp1q1/pP1p4/P1rP1PNP/B1Pb2PK/R1Q2R2 w - -',In control positionally so that despite the material disadvantage black is winning here.

1270,34,38,2Bf4,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/8/1p1Pp1q1/pP1p1b2/P1rP1PNP/B1P3PK/R2Q1R2 w - -',Very strong this move forces white to address the terrible double threat on g3.

1273,34,41,2d6,b'4r1k1/1b3ppp/3P4/1p2p1q1/pP1p1b2/r2P1PNP/B1P3PK/R3QR2 b - -',Maybe Qf2 would've shown a little more fight but there's little white can do to stop black at this point.
1274,34,42,2Bd5,b'4r1k1/5ppp/3P4/1p1bp1q1/pP1p1b2/r2P1PNP/B1P3PK/R3QR2 w - -',"! A very nice move. This brings us to the final stage of the game ""D"" for Dominate!

Can you see why the bishop is immune?"
1275,34,43,2Bxd5,b'4r1k1/5ppp/3P4/1p1Bp1q1/pP1p1b2/r2P1PNP/2P3PK/R3QR2 b - -',White doesn't see it can you?

White needs his queen to protect the g3 knight otherwise the white king has to deal with insurmountable mate threats. Rxa1 forces the queen to f2 (all other moves leave the Ng3 -- and the white king -- hung out to dry) and after Rxf1 white is out of tricks.
1277,34,45,3Qxa1,b'4r1k1/5ppp/3P4/1p1Bp1q1/pP1p1b2/3P1PNP/2P3PK/Q4R2 b - -',? And now there's a mate in 6. Can you find it?

(discovered check with the bishop) would give white the a rook it would cost the bishop.  Hm actually white's black bishop move is starting to look better and better.

Sure white's black bishop could then pick off the rook but then white's a rook falls to the black bishop.  Unless white moves the rook (Rb1) in which case black must respond with Bg7.  KxB follows BxB.  If white opts for the rook trade black makes out a pawn ahead.
1322,37,2,1Ne7+,b'rnb2rk1/pp1pNp1p/2p3pb/q7/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White's knight had to go somewhere.  NxB puts baby in the corner while burying black's a rook almost as deep as it currently is.  (Two moves are required to get the bishop out of the way as opposed to one move to slide the rook back).
1323,37,3,Rxc8,b'rnr4k/pp1p1p1p/2p3pb/q7/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Free pawn.

1327,37,7,1Nxe4,b'r6k/pp1p2bp/1qp3p1/8/2BNnr2/1PP5/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?  How does this protect against QxR?  It isn't like that knight can fork the rooks.
1328,37,8,2Qh3,b'7k/pp3rbp/1qp1N1p1/3p4/8/1PnB3Q/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White is up four points.  Every trade works to white's further advantage.  I'm not sure why this was preferred to NxB though it does prep BxPg6 a sweet move picking off the remaining black rook.
1329,37,9,2Ne4,b'7k/pp3rbp/1qp1N1p1/3p4/4n3/1P1B3Q/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',There's a good defense.  Imminent doom averted!
1330,37,10,Rxf2,b'7k/pp4bp/1qp1N1p1/3p4/4n3/1P1B3Q/P4rPP/4RRK1 w - -',Black trades a rook for a rook and pawn.  He'll need better swaps than that to make up those three points.  And without rooks.

1333,37,13,2Rxe4,b'7k/pp4bp/1qp1N1p1/8/4R3/1P5P/P6P/5R1K b - -',Doesn't it always work out the opponent's pieces become invisible to your bishop?  Black's bishop can see only one king protected pawn.
1334,37,14,Kxg7,b'8/pp4k1/1qp3p1/7p/4R3/1P5P/P6P/5R1K w - -',Trades still work to white's advantage even though the score is tied.  White has more pieces.  That black bishop was sort of worthless though not sure it was worth a knight.

I'm playing black so I'm preparing my fave Sicilian Defense once he opened e4. So let me hear all of your criticisms and suggestion because my annotation was based on my logical perception and evaluations.

My opponent played e4.."
1342,38,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Most of the time I replied c5 It's very rare I used e5. But e5 is the most logical and solid  reply from black
1343,38,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My opponent continued his development according to widely accepted opening theory. Nf6 control the e5 and influenced the d4 square and as well the normal development of of one of his minor pieces for the purpose of  king castle.
1344,38,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I played my favorite Najdorf variation the fave of Fischer and Kasparov. This move gives black queen bishop free development and to restrict white pawn advance in e5 square.
1345,38,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',d4 the most common reply from white. Danish GM Bent Larsen heavily criticized the exchange of  center pawn with the plank pawns. He developed and popularized one opening  the Larsen Opening which begin with b3.
1346,38,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',the normal reply from black
1347,38,6,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',white was too aggressive with this move.
1348,38,7,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I can play Nc6 which is the usual reply from black. But  I want to try other possible variations.
1349,38,8,Bxd7+,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Maybe his first objective is to remove my queen bishop since no one will pin his knight in f3 and as well his light square are much more defined and objective than my position.
1350,38,9,Nxd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think 5..Nc6 are much good than this move but I want to try other variations and the next couple of moves out of bookline.
1351,38,10,Qxd4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',centralizing his queen and also restrict the advance of my g pawn most of the players agree 6. Nxd4 is the logical move
1352,38,11,Nc3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White other good continuation are: 7. 0-0 e5 8. Qe3 Be7 9. Nc3 0-0 10. h3 Qc7 11. Bd2 Qc6 and white has a small advantage
1353,38,12,g6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',I'm worry to play 7..e6 here because white is still postponing his castling in kingside. I think he want a long castling The purpose of this castling his queen rook supporting his queen attacking my d6 pawn and as well preparing for kingside attack. atleast my pawn at this moment it is supported by e7 pawn so I decided to fianchetto my bishop and then king castle.
1354,38,13,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Just what I feel...
1355,38,14,Bg7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I'm looking the safety of my king before white break the center.
1356,38,15,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/4P3/3Q4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',White start to break the center which in my opinion was to premature. I think the most accurate plan for white is start to advance his h pawn and preparing to exchange his bishop against my bishop in g7 or vice versa and then shift his forces in kingside
1357,38,16,1Nh5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/4P2n/3Q4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',just intended to pin the pawn and the white queen but with loss of my two minor pieces in exchange of a rook. If 10.. Ne8 white continue 11. Bf4 then 12. Rhe1. Either my move white still has slight edge 10.. Nh5 I admit is too risky to exchange my two minor pieces against rook!!
1358,38,17,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/4P2n/3Q2P1/2N1BN2/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - g3',Before I played 10..Nf5 I already anticipate white will make this committal move.
1359,38,18,Bxe5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/4b2n/3Q2P1/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',Not 12.. dxe5? resulted to one piece down.

1361,38,20,1gxh5,b'3r1rk1/pp2pp1p/6p1/4p2P/8/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/2K4R b - -',So now at the first glance its much easy to handle the white position his first objective is to exchange my other rook and then shift his two minor pieces to harass my two pawns in queenside which give him a two passed pawn. generally two minor pieces has an advantage against a rook.
1362,38,21,1b6,b'3r1rk1/p3pp1p/1p4p1/4p2P/8/2N1B3/PPP2P1P/2K4R w - -',It restrict bishop's activity.

1364,38,23,1Kg7,b'3r1r2/p3ppkp/1p4p1/4p2P/P7/2N1B3/1PP2P1P/2K4R w - -',I'm starting to move my king to participate in battle before white overwhelm the queenside.
1365,38,24,1a5,b'3r1r2/p3ppkp/1p4p1/P3p2P/8/2N1B3/1PP2P1P/2K4R b - -',with the intention to create a pass pawn and threatening my a7 pawn 
1366,38,25,1bxa5,b'3r1r2/p3ppkp/6p1/p3p2P/8/2N1B3/1PP2P1P/2K4R w - -',Its take a time for me before making this move. My plan is to remove all of pawns in queenside leaving only white c pawn and then shift the game in kingside  because I have a couple of pawns. My queen rook watching the queenside and my other rook supporting my plan in kingside  by pushing all of my pawns with the help of my king.
1367,38,26,Rd7,b'5r2/B2rppkp/6p1/p3p2P/8/2N5/1PP2P1P/2K4R w - -',I want to stay my rook in d file I don't want to give his king a chance to move via d2
1368,38,27,2hxg6,b'r7/3rppkp/1B4P1/p3p3/8/2N5/1PP2P1P/2K4R b - -',I let white to capture my pawn eversince he capture my knight. I want a connecting pawns rather than two double pawns even I'm pawn up.
1369,38,28,2hxg6,b'r7/3rppk1/1B4p1/p3p3/8/2N5/1PP2P1P/2K4R w - -',this is good instead of 20..fxg6 because it will isolated my double pawns in e file which is not good.
1370,38,29,2Rd1,b'r7/3rppk1/1B4p1/p3p3/8/2N5/1PP2P1P/2KR4 b - -',white he want to remove my rook's command in d file so he like to exchange.
1371,38,30,2Rxd1+,b'r7/4ppk1/1B4p1/p3p3/8/2N5/1PP2P1P/2Kr4 w - -',I accept to exchange the rook

1373,38,32,2Kd3,b'r7/4pk2/1B4p1/p3pp2/8/2NK4/1PP2P1P/8 b - -',White should move his king in kingside he overestimate the position.

1375,38,34,2Kc4,b'r7/4pk2/1B6/p3ppp1/2K5/2N5/1PP2P1P/8 b - -',He totally committed his king to support his two minor piece in queenside but neglecting the kingside. It's not too late  his move should move 25. Ke3.
1376,38,35,2g4,b'r7/4pk2/1B6/p3pp2/2K3p1/2N5/1PP2P1P/8 w - -',Aside from advancing my pawn it restrict the f and h pawn these two pawns soon will be the target of my rook.
1377,38,36,2Nd1,b'r7/4p3/1B3k2/p2Kpp2/6p1/8/1PP2P1P/3N4 b - -',Aside for the intention of 28. c4 it support his f2 pawn and move his knight in kingside.
1378,38,37,2Kc6,b'r7/8/1BK1pk2/p3pp2/6p1/8/1PP2P1P/3N4 b - -',I can play Rh8 but I' still wait his king to advance near my rook and also looking for the advance of my a pawn to exchange atleast with his b pawn.
1379,38,38,2Rc8+,b'2r5/8/1BK1pk2/p3pp2/6p1/8/1PP2P1P/3N4 w - -',just only for tempo to distract his bishop in diagonal g1-a7.

1391,38,50,4Kd5,b'1Q6/8/6q1/3K4/2P1p3/4k3/8/8 b - -',White should avoid the e5 and d6 square because it will skewer his queen after I checked his king.

1398,38,57,Qd1+,b'8/2PK4/8/8/2k5/8/8/3q4 w - -',The strategy for the series of these checks here is to pressure white to put his king in c8 then giving a chance for me to advance my king.
1399,38,58,Qh5+,b'4K3/2P5/8/7q/2k5/8/8/8 w - -',White is already lost here. But still hoping for my mistake :-)
1400,38,59,Kc6+,b'1K6/2P5/2k5/8/8/1q6/8/8 w - -',White resigns. If 57. Ka8 then 57.. Kb7mate. If 57. Kc8 then 57...Qg8 mate..It's a very big win for me a very difficult endgame and I acknowledge white for this game one of my best.
