0,0,0,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Looks like white is getting ready to castle early.
1,0,1,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P2b1/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black sees an opportunity to pin the knight.
2,0,2,Qd6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3P2b1/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The intent here is to push the e pawn forward until it can fork white's bishop and knight. With the knight pinned the fork can prove quite devastating.
3,0,3,e5,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3pp3/3P2b1/1P1BPN2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',If white takes with the d4 pawn then black takes back with the c6 knight - again forking white's bishop and knight.
4,0,4,e4,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3Pp1b1/1P1BPN2/PBPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',The fork is in place.
5,0,5,h3,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3Pp1b1/1P1BPN1P/PBPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White tries to scare the bishop away.
6,0,6,Bxf3,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3Pp3/1P1BPb1P/PBPN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White just takes the knight anyway.
7,0,7,exd3,b'r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p4/3P4/1P1pPP1P/PBPN1P2/R2QK2R w KQkq -',And the white grabs the bishop.
8,0,8,g6,b'2kr1b1r/pppn1p1p/2nq2p1/3p4/3P4/1P1PPP1P/PBQN1P2/2KR3R w - -',Push pawn to allow the bishop to develop.
9,0,9,Nb6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2p1p/1nnq2p1/3p4/3P4/1P1PPP1P/PBQN1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Since white castled on the queenside and to avoid the block of white pawns in the center black brings minor pieces over to the queenside.
10,0,10,Bg7,b'2kr3r/ppp2pbp/1nnq2p1/3p4/3PP3/1P1P1P1P/PBQN1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Black decides not to exchange pawns in the middle. If an exchange happens let white do it. That would triple-up the white pawns and make them an easy target later in the game. If black exchanged then white could undouble the pawns on the d file and open the main diagonal for white's bishop. It's better to let white do the exchange.
11,0,11,1e5,b'2kr3r/ppp2pbp/1nnq2p1/3pP3/3P4/1P1P1P1P/PBQN1P2/1K1R3R b - -',But white is not interested in the exchange but in blocking black's bishop and in pushing the queen out of the d6 square.
12,0,12,1a4,b'2kr3r/ppp2pbp/1nn1q1p1/3pP3/P2P4/1P1P1P1P/1BQN1P2/1K1R3R b - a3',I see this move as weak. It leaves the b3 pawn more vulnerable. A queen and knight are looking after it right now but if those two pieces are captured or forced to move then the pawn in front of the king is left unprotected.
13,0,13,1f6,b'2kr3r/ppp3bp/1nn1qpp1/3pP3/P2P4/1P1P1P1P/1BQN1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Time to disrupt white's pawn line along the main diagonal.
14,0,14,1f4,b'2kr3r/ppp3bp/1nn1qpp1/3pP3/P2P1P2/1P1P3P/1BQN1P2/1K1R3R b - -',And white brings in reinforcements.
15,0,15,Rhf8,b'2kr1r2/ppp3bp/1nn1q1p1/3pP3/P2P4/1P1P3P/1BQN1P2/1K1R3R w - -',Black moves to take the unprotected f2 pawn - and move the rook to where it can later threaten the poorly supported d4 pawn.
16,0,16,2Qc5,b'2kr4/ppp3bp/1nn1q1p1/2QpP3/P2P1r2/1P1P3P/1B1N1P1R/1K1R4 b - -',White brings queen to protect the d4 pawn.
17,0,17,2Qc1,b'2kr1b2/ppp4p/1nn1q1p1/3pP3/P2P1r2/1P1P3P/1B1N1P1R/1KQR4 b - -',Queen retreats for safety and the d4 pawn is at the mercy of the c6 knight.
18,0,18,Rxd4,b'2kr1b2/ppp4p/1n2q1p1/3pP3/P2r4/1P1P3P/3N1P1R/1KQR4 w - -',From here black can threaten two more pawns.
19,0,19,2f4,b'2kr1b2/ppp4p/1n2q1p1/3pP3/P2r1P2/1P1P3P/3N3R/1KQR4 b - f3',That was a blunder. White just offers up a pawn for free.
20,0,20,2Nf1,b'2kr1b2/ppp4p/1n2q1p1/3pP3/P4r2/1P1P3P/7R/1KQR1N2 b - -',Maybe not for free since now the queen has her sights on the rook.
21,0,21,Rd7,b'2k2b2/pppr3p/1n4p1/3pq3/P4r2/1P1P3P/2R5/1KQR1N2 w - -',White moves to threaten the king and black moves to protect. I had considered moving the bishop to g7 in order to threaten mate along the main diagonal but I would not be able to do that if white checked the king with a rook on c7.
22,0,22,Bg7,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3pq3/P4r2/1P1P3P/2R4N/1KQR4 w - -',Now the mate threat becomes obvious.
23,0,23,2Ra2,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3pq3/P4r2/1P1P3P/R6N/1KQR4 b - -',White moves to protect the a1 square from the black queen.
24,0,24,2Rf2,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3pq3/P7/1P1P3P/R4r1N/1KQR4 w - -',Black's rook moves in as an apparent sacrifice. If white's rook takes the black rook then checkmate follows in one move. White could move the d1 rook to d2 but black would exchange in response.
25,0,25,Qa1+,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3p4/P7/1P1P3P/5R1N/qKQR4 w - -',Check but not quite mate. The king can escape to c2.
26,0,26,3Qb2,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3p4/P7/1P1P3P/qQK2R1N/3R4 b - -',White's only move is to block with the queen.
27,0,27,3Qxb2#,b'2k5/pppr2bp/1n4p1/3p4/P7/1P1P3P/1qK2R1N/3R4 w - -',And then checkmate!
28,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

Yup you will come across a scene that is all too familiar.  I get a reasonable game against a Master and look as though I will be able to hold out for a Master Draw then it all goes belly up.  Indeed I even had high hopes of a Master Victory in this game particularly as I was the white player in a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  If you are the white player in the Exchange Variation you should be doing all you can to ensure that you a. keep the existing pawn structure intact and b. exchange down to a K & P ending as my opponent Paolo inflicted this on me in my game against him which I annotated as follows.http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  Sadly although I managed to exchange down to a single rook ending still keeping the kingside pawn majority while so doing it was that wretched black rook that turned the game in my opponent's favour.  So the way Ken kept me tied down in that ending until I eventually cracked (I did not want to wait for the executioner like I did against Master Drhpatron - game annotated as follows http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/moving-the-king-in-the-opening?gm=38665) sucked big time - I am really really trying to break the Experts' and Masters' psychological hold over me.  One day I just hope it will finally come.  Anyhow here is the Gameknot Analysis version:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15970775&rnd=0.3195287162576994"
29,1,1,dxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',4. ...... dxc6 - the first few moves have been the standard moves of the Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  dxc6 is more commonly played than bxc6 for some reason.  Note the pawn structure and visualise it with all pieces bar the kings on the board.  Certainly with correct play if it is a K & P ending then provided the WK (in my case Henry) and the white pawns can move up the board at an appropriate juncture then white should win.
30,1,2,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',5. .... Bg4 - I remember a comment from Ken in that Paolo game in which he recommended this move for me.  It is an aggressive way to counter the Lopez and prevents for now Nxe5.
31,1,3,h5,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p5/4p2p/4P1b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq h6',6. .... h5 - it is very dangerous to play PxB here because it opens up the h column to a black rook.  Now just stick the Wicked Witch of the West on h4 (should the f3 knight evade capture) and white is suddenly in Old Matey's shadow.
32,1,4,Nbd2,b'r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p2p/4P1b1/3P1N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',8. Nbd2 - I concentrate on developing my queenside for the nonce.
33,1,5,1d4,b'r3kb1r/1pp2pp1/p1p2qn1/4p2p/3PP1b1/5N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',10. d4 - I play it because it is recommended in the World DB but why not exd4 in reply?  Ken decided to pile on the pressure with Nf4.  Now and only now do I get rid of Ken's lsb.
34,1,6,1g3,b'r3kb1r/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p3/3PPnp1/5NP1/PPPN1P2/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',12. g3 - this move is played to prevent the Witch from landing on h4.
35,1,7,1Qxf3,b'r3kb1r/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p3/3PPn2/5QP1/PPPN1P2/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',13. Qxf3 - one set of pawns and two sets of minor pieces have been exchanged but I still keep my kingside pawn majority.
36,1,8,Qxe5,b'r3kb1r/1pp2pp1/p1p1n3/4q3/4P3/5QP1/PPPN1P2/R1B1R1K1 w kq -',14. ..... Qxe5 - another set of pawns have been exchanged but there is still my kingside pawn majority!
37,1,9,Bxc5,b'r3k2r/1pp2pp1/p1p1n3/2b5/4P3/6P1/PPPN1P2/R1B1R1K1 w kq -',16. ..... Bxc5 - on initiating the queen trade I moved out of the DB into open play.  Ken develops his final minor piece.  I continue to improve my development - I have to clear the line for Fou Lenoir and the quickest way to do this is to stick my knight on f3 which I do next move.
38,1,10,1Rxe3,b'2kr3r/1pp2pp1/p1p1n3/8/4P3/4RNP1/PPP2P2/R5K1 b - -',19. Rxe3 - in order to keep my kingside pawn majority intact I recaptured with the rook.  That is another set of minor pieces off the board.
39,1,11,Rxd4,b'2k4r/1pp2pp1/p1p5/8/3rP3/4R1P1/PPP2P2/R5K1 w - -',20. ....... Rxd4 - Ken also allows his knight to be traded off but at a price - he puts his rook in a dominant position.
40,1,12,2cxd3,b'7r/1ppk1pp1/p1p5/8/4P3/3P2P1/PP3P2/4R1K1 b - -',23. cxd3 - now we move into a R & P ending but you would never believe that my position will go south from here now would you?
41,1,13,2Rc2,b'8/1ppk1pp1/p1p5/1r6/4P3/P2P2P1/1PR2P2/6K1 b - -',26. Rc2 - although Gameknot Analysis did not give this as an innacuracy I think this was where I went wrong.  I think in retrospect that b4 was called for here.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
42,1,14,2Rd2,b'8/1ppk1pp1/p1p5/8/4P3/Pr1P2P1/1P1R1P2/6K1 b - -',27. Rd2 - passive but the only way to prevent myself from immediately losing a pawn.
43,1,15,gxf5,b'8/1pp5/p1p1k3/5p2/3P4/Pr4P1/1P1R1PK1/8 w - -',30. ..... gxf5 - pawn trade.
44,1,16,3g4,b'8/1pp5/2p5/p2k1p2/3P2P1/Pr3P2/1P1R1K2/8 b - -',33. g4?? - gameknot analysis did not class this as an innacuracy but here I think that shuttling Henry from e2 to f2 was a better plan until Ken showed his hand but this felt so much like my game against drhpatron that I decided to break out of this passivity.  But it was to my detriment - sigh and double sigh!
45,1,17,3Re2+,b'8/1pp5/2p5/p7/3Pk1P1/Pr6/1P2RK2/8 b - -',35. Re2+ - wrong plan g5 had to be tried here.
46,1,18,3Ke1,b'8/1pp1R3/2p5/p7/3P1kP1/P7/1r6/4K3 b - -',37. Ke1 - this move should have been played instead of Re7 on the last move according to Gameknot Analysis but all my pawns will now fall like rotten apples tears!
47,1,19,b6,b'8/3R4/1pp5/p7/Pr1Pk3/8/8/5K2 w - -',41. ...... b6 - here I decided to wave the white flag as there is no way I will be able to save my remaining pawns.  Ken will be spoilt for choice as to which pawn to crown.  I still have a lot to learn.  Anyhow hope you have had a good read and do enjoy your weekend.  Bye for now - Joanne
48,2,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Book so far.
49,2,1,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/P1pP4/5N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq a3',Undermining the Pawn support. Note that 4... P-QR3? 5 PxP PxP?? 6 RxR costs Black a piece.
50,2,2,axb5,b'rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/b7/1P6/2pP4/5N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Doubling and isolating the QBP's.
51,2,3,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1b6/2pP4/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Time to start developing.
52,2,4,e3,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1b6/2pP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Supporting my bastion and opening a line for the KB.
53,2,5,b3,b'rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p1p5/1b6/2pP4/1PN1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Forcing Black to exchange his advanced P or lose it.
54,2,6,Qxb3,b'rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p1p5/1b6/3P4/1QN1PN2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Aiming at Black's undeveloped K-side.
55,2,7,1d5,b'r2qkbnr/3npppp/p1p5/1b1P4/8/1QN1PN2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Opening more lines as I have a time advantage.
56,2,8,1Rxf1,b'r2qkbnr/3npppp/p1p5/3P4/8/1QN1PN2/5PPP/R1B1KR2 b Qkq -',Black exchanges a developed piece for an undeveloped one giving me more tempi.
57,2,9,1Nxd5,b'r2qkbnr/3npppp/p7/3N4/8/1Q2PN2/5PPP/R1B1KR2 b Qkq -',My time and spatial advantages outweigh the Pawn minus.
58,2,10,1Nf4,b'r2qkbnr/3n1ppp/p3p3/8/5N2/1Q2PN2/5PPP/R1B1KR2 b Qkq -',Once again focusing on the K-side.
59,2,11,1Qc4,b'r2qkbnr/5ppp/p3p3/2n5/2Q2N2/4PN2/5PPP/R1B1KR2 b Qkq -',A tactical adjustment.
60,2,12,1Bd2,b'r2qkbnr/5ppp/4p3/p1n5/2Q2N2/4PN2/3B1PPP/R3KR2 b Qkq -',Preparing to connect my Rooks.
61,2,13,1Nh5,b'r2qkbnr/5p1p/4p3/p1n3pN/2Q5/4PN2/3B1PPP/R3KR2 b Qkq -',I advance on the vulnerable wing.
62,2,14,1Ke2,b'r2qkbnr/5p2/4p2p/p1n3pN/2Q5/4PN2/3BKPPP/R4R2 b kq -',Rooks connected completing development. Black needs several more moves to finish his.
63,2,15,1Rfd1,b'r2qkbnr/8/4p2p/p1n2ppN/2Q5/4PN2/3BKPPP/R2R4 b kq -',Threatening a discovered attack on the Q.
64,2,16,1Bb4,b'r2qkbnr/8/4p2p/2n2ppN/pBQ5/4PN2/4KPPP/R2R4 b kq -',Black must now concede the Q file.
65,2,17,2Bxc5,b'r3kbnr/2q5/4p2p/2B2ppN/p1Q5/4PN2/4KPPP/R2R4 b kq -',Closing in on the King.
66,2,18,2Qxe6+,b'r3kbnr/8/4Q2p/2q2ppN/p7/4PN2/4KPPP/R2R4 b kq -',Black's K has no help from his friends.
67,2,19,2Nf6#,b'r3kb1r/4n3/4QN1p/2q2pp1/p7/4PN2/4KPPP/R2R4 b kq -',Finis.
68,3,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Until some three months ago I played the Slav against 1.d4 but I felt uncomfortable in the resulting middlegame positions so I decided to switch to 1...Nf6.
69,3,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The Budapest Gambit is now my main weapon against 1.d4 because it results in open positions in which I feel more comfortable than in closed ones. But to get into the Budapest my opponent has to play 2.c4. Now I have to come up with something else.
70,3,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I decide to play a Grunfeld defence... If my opponent allows this.
71,3,3,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',!? Interesting move. White doesn't decide to play c4 and instead develops another piece. It's hard to reach a Grunfeld position now.
72,3,4,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',This had to be played anytime because otherwise 2...g6 wouldn't make sense.
73,3,5,e3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Still no c4. Note that after 4.c4 I wouldn't be able to play 4...d5 to try to reach a Grunfeld because 5.Bxf6 Bxf6 6.cxd5 would win a pawn. I would probably have played 4...O-O and only play ...d5 after Nc3.
74,3,6,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p3B1/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq c6',Now that my opponent refuses to play c4 I decide to move up my own c pawn. I'm suspecting my opponent won't play c4 at all and will instead go for a system with c3.
75,3,7,cxd4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3p4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Trying to open up the position a bit.
76,3,8,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.
77,3,9,c3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/6B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',As expected.
78,3,10,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ d6',I'm trying to get some play in the centre of the board as soon as possible to try and punish White for his somewhat passive opening play. This will be hard though because this system is very solid and White has no weaknesses.
79,3,11,Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',!? Interestingly this has never been played before. All games we were following continued 9.O-O. The queen and the bishop are lined up on the same diagonal but they're biting on granite now because there's only the well-defended g6 pawn to attack.
80,3,12,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Meanwhile I'm preparing my third thrust in the centre ...e5.
81,3,13,1O-O-O,b'r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R b - -',?! This is dubious in my opinion. the pawns on the other flank seem to form a better shield for the king. But there are four pieces around to help defending the king so it can't be that dangerous can it?
82,3,14,1e5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/3pp1B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R w - e6',?! I'm a minor piece behind in development but my center control is greater and my rooks both have a nice file to control (once the c8 bishop has moved the a8 rook can go to c8). So I thought this break was reasonable but the computers don't really like it as after 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5 Rxe5 White can chase my rook with 13.Nf3 Re8 and I'm also left with an isolated d pawn. Probably White has a small plus there.
83,3,15,1Rhe1,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3pn1B1/8/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KRR3 b - -',? This can't be good. White is voluntarily giving up the bishop pair in an open position? A strange decision.
84,3,16,Bf5,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3p1bB1/8/2PQ1N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRR3 w - -',Developing with tempo. White's king is starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. The computers don't like this move and suggest 13...Qa5 instead.. I'm not sure why.
85,3,17,Rxe1,b'r2q2k1/pp3pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRr3 w - -',?! I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about the possibility of checks on the back row that could slow down my attack.. probably that's why I exchanged.  Another reason was that I didn't want to lose a tempo if I'd play 14...Rc8 and my opponent exchanged twice on e8 with 15.Rxe8+ Qxe8 16.Qxe8 Rxe8 (this would make 14...Rc8 a loss of tempo). It seems illogical though because I'm the attacking side and would want to keep as many pieces on the board as possible.
86,3,18,Qc7,b'r5k1/ppq2pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 w - -',This is a pawn sac but in fact I'm already planning to sac more than just the isolated d pawn..
87,3,19,1Bxf6,b'r5k1/ppq2pbp/5Bp1/1Q1p1b2/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 b - -',?! This is not the losing mistake but a step in the wrong direction. It's obvious my opponent is planning to grab the d5 pawn (otherwise he'd never exchange this bishop for my knight) but that would be a blunder as we'll see later.
88,3,20,1Qxd5,b'r5k1/ppq2p1p/5bp1/3Q1b2/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 b - -',? And there it is. It was even set as a conditional move for the first time in this game.
89,3,21,1Bxc3,b'r5k1/ppq2p1p/6p1/3Q1b2/8/2b2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 w - -',! My opponent had obviously overlooked this sac or thought it was not dangerous. I can imagine this because it seems so strange to sac the fianchetto bishop. But in this case it wins and is by far the best move in the position. I knew I couldn't calculate all the variations but it just felt right. In this case my intuition didn't let me down.
90,3,22,1Kd1,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3Q1b2/8/2q2N2/P2N1PPP/3KR3 b - -',All forced. Now this is a critical position which deserves a diagram. Now there are three moves that seem to continue the attack: 19...Bc2+ 19...Bd3 and 19...Qc2+. Two lead to a draw one wins.
91,3,23,1Bc2+,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3Q4/8/2q2N2/P1bN1PPP/3KR3 w - -',? The wrong one. This only leads to a draw. 19...Qc2+? also leads to a draw similar to the game: 20.Ke2 Re8+ 21.Kf1 Bd3+ 22.Kg1 Rxe1+ 23.Nxe1 Qxd2 and this is a transposition to the game. Winning was the silent and beautiful move 19...Bd3! (well I don't know if silent is the right term but we call a move that's not check and doesn't capture a piece a silent move in . Now there's the mating threat on c2 as well as the threat of 20...Qa1+.  I'm sure I'vDutch)e also looked at this move but probably I thought that 20.Nd4 would be good. But then Black can also follow up with 20...Qa1+ 21.Nb1 Qxb1+ 22.Kd2. Relatively best here is 20.Qb3 but this also loses to 20...Qa1+.
92,3,24,Qxd2,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3Q4/8/3b4/P2q1PPP/4N1K1 w - -',These moves were again forced. This is another critical position. It seems as if White is in bad shape: his knight is under attack and there's also the back rank mate threat (e.g. 23...Qxd2 24.Nxd3?? Qd1+ 25.Ne1 Qxe1#). But this is not true.
93,3,25,2Qe5,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/4Q3/8/3b4/P2q1PPP/4N1K1 b - -',? It's only this move that lost the game for White. Right here he could have forced a perpetual check. The first steps are logical: 24.Qd8+ Kg7 25.Qd4+. Now There are roughly three variations. Firstly the king can go back to the 8th row but then White follows up with another check on d8 etc. Secondly Black can play 25...Kh6 but now the checks on d4 and h4 will force a perpetual. Thirdly there's 25...f6. Now White follows up with 26.Qd7+ and Black can again go back to the back rank (when checks on d8 and d7 will do the job) or play 26...Kh6. On this move White can play 27.Qh3+ and here's probably what White missed: it would be absolutely horrible to play for a win with 27...Kg5?? because of the rooyal fork 28.Nf3+. This is why Black has to accept perpetual check here too.
94,3,26,2Qe2,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/4Q3/8/3b4/P3qPPP/4N1K1 w - -',Forcing another exchange to go into either a queen ending or a bishop vs knight ending.
95,3,27,2Qxe2,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/8/8/3b4/P3QPPP/4N1K1 b - -',My opponent chose the latter. I suppose he didn't like the mating threats in the queen ending.
96,3,28,Bd3,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/8/8/3b4/P1N2PPP/6K1 w - -',Somehow I played this instead of my first plan 26...Bc4.. Note that if I'd played 26...Bc4 White cannot defend the pawn with 27.Nb4? because of 27...a5 when the knight has to leave the pawn undefended.
97,3,29,2a3,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/8/1Nb5/P7/5PPP/6K1 b - -',Releasing the knight which was defending the pawn.

99,3,31,3Ne3,b'6k1/5p1p/6p1/pp6/2b5/P3N3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',White should be starting to activate his king very soon if he wants to keep any drawing chances.
100,3,32,Ke6,b'8/5p1p/4k1p1/pp1N4/5P2/P2b2P1/7P/6K1 w - -',My king is coming closer and closer to the queenside to help its pawns to promote.
101,3,33,3Kf2,b'8/5p1p/6p1/3k4/Np3P2/3b2P1/5K1P/8 b - -',Finally the White king is approaching the queenside too but Black is still winning.
102,3,34,3Nb2,b'8/5p1p/6p1/3k1b2/5P2/1p2K1P1/1N5P/8 b - -',Blocking the pawn.
103,3,35,Kc3,b'8/5p1p/6p1/8/5P1P/1pk3P1/1Nb5/2K5 w - -',Now that White needs all its forces to stop the b pawn my king starts its journey to the kingside to grab all the pawns there. I had calculated that I'd be able to take the three kingside pawns before White can defend them.
104,3,36,4f5,b'8/5p1p/6p1/2N2P2/7P/1p2k1P1/2b5/2K5 b - -',Not much else to do... Maybe he was hoping I'd voluntarily mess up my pawn structure by taking 47...fxg5 but of course I won't.
105,3,37,5Nxf5+,b'8/5p1p/6p1/5N2/7P/6k1/8/2K5 b - -',White chooses to exchange down into the pawn ending which is easily winning for me (especially as I know the theory on pawn endings quite well) but the ending with minor pieces was hopeless as well.
106,3,38,5Kf1,b'8/5p1p/8/7P/8/6k1/5p2/5K2 b - -',Blocking my pawn but not for long.
107,3,39,5Kf3,b'8/5p1p/8/7P/8/5k2/5p2/5K2 w - -',! Precision 'till the end. This is the fastest way to mate. Also easy was 54...h6 but after 55.Ke2 Kg2 the White king can flee to the queenside and postpone the inevitable. Now White is in zugzwang.
108,3,40,Ke3,b'8/5p1p/7P/8/8/4k3/5p2/5K2 w - -',But now the king is forced to the side of the board. White decided to resign here. Mate can follow like this: 56.Kg2 Ke2 57.Kg3 f1=Q 58.Kh2 Qf3 59.Kg1 Qg4+ 60.Kh2 Kf2 and ...Qg2# or ...Qh5# to follow. It was an enjoyable game to play hope you also enjoyed my annotation.

I thought this would be a game that would be nice to annotate because it is one that made me think very hard called for creativity in the opening instead of a memorized one  and it would demonstrate the danger of using uncommon openings as the responses are not all given forcing some blunders early into the game that can be fatal.

It is tracking much of the recommended play in ECO D11 leading to an equal game but with a slight edge to White in some variants.  Here in 10...Be7 Black chooses the slightly more passive alternative to 10...Bd6.

226,9,4,1Bd2,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/4p3/3n4/1b1P4/5B2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',With the Black bishop temporarily blocking the Rook's open b-file this seemed to be the best way to free White's Queen-side pieces and to get my pieces positioned to protect and then advance the queen-side majority pawns.  This idea seems to back-fire later.
227,9,5,2Bxd5,b'5rk1/p4ppp/1q2p3/3B4/1r1P4/8/PP3PPP/R3QRK1 b - -',I hated to give up my bishop but the centralized Black knight was just too well-positioned.  And more importantly this exchange gives Black a resulting isolani in the center after he takes my own queen's pawn.  That was my plan to exploit that weakness so that I emerged a pawn ahead going into the endgame. 
228,9,6,2Qd2,b'5rk1/p4ppp/8/3p4/1r2q3/1P6/P2Q1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',This creates a strange position now in which his queen's pawn is both doomed and also unable to move forward since moving it now cuts off the Black queen's protection of the Rook on b4.  This is one of those odd moments where you see subtle re-deployments of the major pieces that convert weaknesses into strengths and vice versa. 
229,9,7,2Qe7,b'5rk1/p3qppp/8/3p4/1r6/1P6/P2Q1PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Not 25...Rd8? 26. Rfe1! followed by 27.

These pawns are all needed to give the White king shelter from the avalanche of checks that his Rooks will be delivering.  And he also knows that as soon as he captures the b-pawn the Rook exchanges will force him to give up his a-pawn with check.
236,9,14,4g4,b'8/pr5k/R7/8/6PK/1P3R2/1r3P1P/8 b - -',The pawn roller finally starts!  It will result in either a couple of White queens on the board or checkmate.

277,11,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',White may have played this with the intention that if black captures as he would in most open sicilians white may recapture and strike the rook at h8. So 3...cxd4 4.Qxd4 Nf6 5.e5 but black could have 5...Nc6 and looking at a few queen moves that save the pawn 6.Qf4 seems to be the only playable move. After 6...Nh5 there could be some complicated play that appears to slightly favor white. 6.Qe3 is losing the pawn by 6...Ng4.

If white captures 4.dxc5 he loses a center pawn. Black may choose to regain by 4...Qa5+ if he wants or keep developing as the pawn isn't going anywhere soon. By the move order Nc3 black threatens to win a pawn. The line 4.dxc5 Qa5 will win the pawn back and white's position seems worse after 5.Bd2 Qxc5 but it 6.Nd5! is a very strong move giving white multiple threats to work with many involving forks on c7. The pawn on b2 is just a decoy as 6...Bxb2 loses to 7.Bb4 Qc6 8.Bb5 and black can give up.

Although this may seem very little compensation for the loss of the nice bishop black can now try to cover up his weaknesses by using his rapid development and center majority his greatest weapon. Moves like Qa5 Nf6 with a well timed d5 or e5 may be potent. @excile I am fully aware of the strength of the black square bishop. But dont treat this like it is a normal sicilian so dont use normal sicilian rules. The gaining of time plus the extra pawn makes Bxc3+ a reasonable idea and should be considered.Concrete analysis instead of using general principles says that Bxc3 is okay.

The loose bishop and the knight behind it signals that a tactic is in play. b4 is a bad move and accomplished nothing. I should also say that white would have been better off doing nothing and passing with 13.Kh1 rather than play b4. It opens up all sorts of possibilities in the position but for black. I would even look at moves like e4. There are too many lines to go through all of them with possibilities going for black. @excile Its time to ignore general principles about developement FOR NOW. After black settles the tactics he can develop. Tactics beat general princples and black has potential tactics.

Attempts to break in with 17...Kxg7 18.Qc1 d5 19.Nxd5 attacks the queen. If 17...Bxd1 then Bxf8 wins without a fight.

This should force the black queen away from her powerful position on d5 while the temporary presence of the knight on f3 still guards e5 and d4 preventing the queen from threatening the a1 rook.

But black has a shot."

Well it isn't nearly as good as Qg4 which not only threatens mate but can meet Qxf3 in any number of ways and increases the pressure on the newly-far-flung d4 pawn.

534,21,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',A sicilian defense. Most popular.
535,21,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White goes probably for the open sicilian. 
536,21,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Nothing wrong but I expected d4. @slywing the realms of the sicilian defense are huge and Bc4 is a extreemely common move in many open and closed sicilians. the move e6 in many cases can be broken down by some pawn thrusts or with a piece sac. Also e6 restricts piece mobility with the light bishop. If white wants to  he can go into a open siclian and the d6 pawn will be left weak and unable to advance in many cases.
537,21,3,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/3p3p/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It would be wrong to label this move as just 'bad' but I would never play it because it just wastes time.@slywing but this is not nearly enough to lose a game even at the grandmasters level. White could probably get a edge in a masters game. I would like to see some of the strongest players on this site get a real advantage from this small move agianst good play. It is not too critical.
538,21,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2ppp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black develops a piece. The position is about =. White looks better. 
539,21,5,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2ppp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Supporting the pawn. White's other option was Nc3 where the move d4 could be played quickly. Would anyone consider advancing or sacrificing the pawn with a move like 0-0?@slywing yes I would probably choose Nc3 personally and head for an open position. The knight is probably going there anyways if d4 is played. However if white intended a closed game which I would prefer not to go to then d3 is fine. The knight ma head to d2 anytime or c3.
540,21,6,Bd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2np1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This square is not optimal for the bishop. The bishop neither looks good nor has an active role at this square. White was probably unsure about where to put the bishop. If he wanted to he could have pllayed Nc3 and waited for 'signs' of where to put the bishop. 
541,21,7,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq e6',The advance is awkward resembling a BOT setup. However here it is not as good as if the white dark square bishop were fianchettoed. Now the d5 square is a target and black has no outposts or weak squares to target himself.
542,21,8,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Nc3 was better. My strong point in chess are tactics and attack strategy but closed positions and manuevering give me headaches. this move a3 might have been intended to play b4 getting a little open play and potentially activating the rook. a simple a5 would stop it. All together b4 idea is not very hopeful.
543,21,9,Bxh3,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1b/1PPB1PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',The first real mistake of the game. Black was doing fine up til now. This is the kind of move to play in general when the position is open you have a majority of your forces at the kingside and they are all at their optimal positions. Preferably the opponent has very few pieces for defense. It can rarely even be played to just gain an initiative. In those positions this move often gains a decisive ad even when no tactical finishes are found these moves force a win. Instead in closed positions with no force to back up the sacrifice and no way to take the initiative this is the kind of move weak players make in attempt to 'open the king'. What they are doing is really 'losing a piece'. As the game continues white's advantage gets bigger. Black probably could have just castled and had a good game. Be6 is even considerable. Anything but this. 
544,21,10,g5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/2np1n1p/2p1p1p1/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1P2/RN1Q1RK1 w kq g6',Black tries to justify his previous mistake with another attacking move. This weakens his kingside more than it does to white and he only has 3 pieces out when none of them can make any immediate action.
545,21,11,Nd4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p1n1p/2p1p1p1/2BnP3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black hopefully realizes now that he will suffer the rest of the game. Trade pieces when up a lot of material is a good idea. 
546,21,12,1Nd5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p1n1p/3Np1p1/2BpP3/P2P3P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This move is good enough and is probably the best move for the knight. But consider Ne2 with Ng3 and Nf4. That knight will not be exchanged but it is slow. Im betting Nd5 is the best knight move but everything should be looked at. 
547,21,13,1Bxd5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp2/3p3p/3Bp1p1/3pP3/P2P3P/1PPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Outposts are not only for knights. The bishop is powerful here and hits f7.
548,21,14,1b4,b'r3k2r/pp2bp2/1q1p3p/3Bp1p1/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq b3',Now white plays a good move to hold the pawn. Is the c pawn weak? Probably not. If black concentrates his force on the c pawn he will be invaded on the light squares. 14...Rc8 15.Qf3(h5) Rxc2 16.Qxf7+ Kd8 17.Ra2 and white will mop up the K side pawns after dealing with some minor nuisances on the Q side. This is just one line. 15.Bc4 is already good enough with Qh5 coming up. 
549,21,15,1Qb5,b'r3k2r/pp2bp2/3p3p/1q1Bp1p1/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black knows he is losing. He has given up on his 'attack' and starts to move on the Q side. It fails.

551,21,17,1Kh1,b'r3k3/pp2bp1r/3p3p/1q1Bp1pQ/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R4R1K b q -',White can now activate his dark squared bishop now with 16.f4 gxf4 17.B/Rxf4. This is just as good preping Rg1 with h4 penetrating the black position.
552,21,18,1Qd7,b'r3k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/3Bp1pQ/1P1pP3/P2P3P/2PB1P2/R4R1K w q -',The queen is moving without effect.

Howver when I gain a huge advantage I like to skip the rough analysis in positions where my opponent has no tactical threats and only minor nuisances and get rid of all of them. It takes less brainpower and effort and can be fairly enjoyable. But your line wins fast.
555,21,21,2Qh5,b'1r2k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/3Bp1pQ/1PPpP3/P2P3P/3B1P2/R5RK b - -',Now if i were black I would almost always play Qa4 repeating the position. In worse positions you should repeat positions if your opponent does as well hoping to draw.
556,21,22,2b5,b'1r2k3/pp1qbp1r/3p3p/1P1Bp1p1/2PpP3/P2P3P/3B1P2/R2Q2RK b - -',????The true meaning of a blunder! White plays carelessly not wanting to repeat the position. However the side effects of the cure are worse than the disease after black's next move. White assumed that Black merely wanted to repeat positions. What he failed tp notice was that Qd7 carried the dealy threat of Qxh3 checkmate! The Qh5 was the only thing preventing that. 
557,21,23,2Qxh3#,b'1r2k3/pp2bp1r/3p3p/1P1Bp1p1/2PpP3/P2P3q/3B1P2/R2Q2RK w - -',"Sure enough black plays the checkmate and lets out a sigh of relief while white tears his hair in frustration. White had a massive positional and material ad while black was completely lost. 
Going back a few moves white could have proceeded with Kh2 to safety the pawn and then continue with Qh5 back. Black's position is devoid of plan. The lesson is whenever you make a move always check IS IT SAFE TACTCIALLY? 
The vast majority of players under 1500 USCF/ 1400FIDE rating do not consistently check for tactics and if the position is tactical they just might blunder the game in one move. If you are like that then checking for tactics every move will bring you up a lot. REal positional chess matters little until you are an expert. If someone had the tactical skill of a world champion but the positional knowledge of a weak club player they could make it to top 1000 in the nation probably much better. Once I did this my rating went up a few hundred points in a few weeks."
558,22,0,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Generally I play 3. Bc4. However I recently lost a few games with Evans Gambit and Guioco Piano openings so I decided to change this game. I didn't realise until after I played my move that it was the same opening that we played in our previous game or I may well have avoided it.
559,22,1,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An unusual response to the Ruy Lopez. It opens the knight to be pinned but provides some support to e5. My personal opinion is that it is weak for Black.
560,22,2,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I grab at the centre with d4 and he exchanges pawns. I really wasn't sure which piece to take with here - I chose to leave my knight where it is and develop my queen. 
561,22,3,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Rather expected - protects his knight but also releases the pin to attack my queen in the centre of the board.
562,22,4,bxc6,b'r2qkbnr/p1pb1ppp/2pp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I thought he might take with the bishop after developing it to d7. I really didn't expect my opponent to double his pawns after our previous game which involved a lot of exchanges and was quickly at a knight and pawn ending. GK analysis pits this as 'Inaccuracy'.
563,22,5,O-O,b'r2qkb1r/p1pb1ppp/2pp1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Standard development of the knights followed by a castle - I do think I probably should have played 10. Bg5 here though. I think the reason I didn't was not to give him a reason to play Be7 yet.
564,22,6,Qd3,b'r2qkb1r/p1pb1ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Doesn't appear to be any immediate threat to the queen on d3 it keeps the DSB diagonal open and it is more actively placed than d1. The rooks will also connect once that bishop moves...

566,22,8,1Nxe5,b'r2qk2r/p1pbbppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I'm not sure if 10... Ng4 is more favourable for Black? In fact looking back now it seems as if 10. e5 might have been a mistake. Anyway Black has let my knight move in to a centre square.
567,22,9,1Be6,b'r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/4bn2/2p1N3/8/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',White moves his attacked bishop I presumed to save his bishop pair and make use of them later. However he gave up a very attack square for my knight on c6.

Kxf1 Kxc6... with me losing my other knight shortly after. If there is a better alternative I'd like to hear it. So instead I decide to rid my opponent of his bishop pair as I'm sure he was trying to keep them and they can be very dangerous!
571,22,13,1Bg5,b'r6r/p1p1kppp/4bn2/2p3B1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Pinning the knight but also prevents the king from moving unless Black would like another set of doubled pawns. Here even though the material is even I believe I am in a very strong position. Oh how quickly that changed...

581,22,23,Ke5,b'8/p1r2pp1/R1p4p/4k3/8/1P3P2/2P2KPP/8 w - -',Releasing the pin on the c-pawn and coming across to defend the pawn.... or so I think.
582,22,24,c5,b'8/p1r2pp1/R6p/2p1k3/8/1P2KP2/2P3PP/8 w - -',I wasn't sure about this move but I suppose it releases the rook from the c-file. But it means my rook looks over the 6th rank...
583,22,25,2f4+,b'8/p1r2pp1/R6p/2p1k3/5P2/1P2K3/2P3PP/8 b - -',Black has to be wary here... 29... Kd5?? 30. c4#.
584,22,26,3h3,b'8/p1r2pp1/R6p/2p2k2/5P2/1P2K2P/2P3P1/8 b - -',Pushing the pawn with tempo - threatening checkmate with g4 now.
585,22,27,3f6,b'8/p1r3p1/R4p1p/2p2k2/5P2/1P2K2P/2P3P1/8 w - -',Giving himself an escape square on g6...
586,22,28,3g4+,b'8/p1r3p1/R4p1p/2p2k2/5PP1/1P2K2P/2P5/8 b - g3',... which I immediately force him onto. As with our other annotated game I've managed to force an advantage in the endgame that has given me an advantage. This time I've forced his black king away from the action and have got my king very active itself. I must concede though it is still very much heading for a draw at the minute.
587,22,29,3h4,b'8/p1r3p1/R4pkp/2p5/5PPP/1P2K3/2P5/8 b - -',I 'settled' on this move here - I really couldn't decide what my best move was and lumped with this to try and make it tough for Black's king to get out of the corner. Maybe Kd3 was a slightly better alternative?
588,22,30,3b4,b'8/p1r3p1/R4pkp/8/1Pp2PPP/4K3/2P5/8 b - -',I didn't think taking it and allowing the rook in behind was a great idea... it would definitely yield a draw then.
589,22,31,Rd7,b'8/p2r2p1/R4pkp/8/1Pp2PPP/2P1K3/8/8 w - -',It was a complete oversight that I allowed Black to attack me and threaten d3 - I was so busy trying to think how I was going to attack Black and try to promote a pawn. Upon analysis it is quickly obvious that Black is giving up a passed pawn to White for several of his pawns.
590,22,32,3h5+,b'8/p2r2p1/R4pkp/7P/1Pp2PP1/2P1K3/8/8 b - -',I decide to use this check now. If Black intends to come down to d3 with his rook then the king cannot go to f7 as it would give up a tempo with Rxa7+ later.
591,22,33,3Ke4,b'8/p2r2pk/R4p1p/7P/1Pp1KPP1/2P5/8/8 b - -',I wasn't sure what else to play really - I'm waiting on Rd3 for the action to start so I play a waiting move that saves me time by avoiding a check.
592,22,34,Rxc3,b'8/R5pk/5p1p/7P/1Pp1KPP1/2r5/8/8 w - -',A pawn each but I can't stop there - my rook and king are both active so I give up my king-side pawns to get that b-pawn further up the board.
593,22,35,3Kxc4,b'8/R5pk/5p1p/7P/1PK2PP1/6r1/8/8 b - -',The first and only move highlighted by GK's computer as yellow - an inaccuracy. An instant 39. b5 Rxg4 40. b6 Rxf4+ 41. Kc3 Rf5 42. b7 Rb5 43. Kxc4 Rb1 means I save the h-pawn. However the line given seems to whittle to a perpetual check draw (as White cannot defend the pawn and avoid the check). I'm not saying my way was correct because it should have played to a draw but I certainly believe my line forces the rook to exchange for the passed pawn leaving the rook to do battle with the three pawns.
594,22,36,4Kc3,b'8/R5pk/5p1p/1P5P/5r2/2K5/8/8 b - -',Again it doesn't look great but there was reasoning (it could be bad reasoning!!). The king has to move up later to defend the pawn which makes Kc5 more attractive. Once the Black rook gets rid of my h-pawn I can move the king up and force the Rook around via h1 or h2. Then I plan to bring my rook down to the 4th rank as defense to both the rook and the later advancing pawns. It is also worth noting that I think I incorrectly analysed that following Kc5 the rook could take the pawn and travel via e5-e8-b8 to stop the pawn - obviously it cannot. 
595,22,37,4Kc4,b'8/R5pk/1P3p1p/7r/2K5/8/8/8 b - -',Stopping Rb5 and forcing it around the board to defend the threat.
596,22,38,4Ra4,b'8/6pk/1P3p1p/8/R1K5/8/8/7r b - -',I want my rook here for later - I feel it restrains Black's later charge with those three pawns as he cannot push one of his pawns then look to catch-up to it... Black will need his king.
597,22,39,4Kb5,b'8/6pk/1P3p1p/1K6/R7/8/8/2r5 b - -',45... Rb1+ is clearly a blunder due to 46. Rb4 and the Black rook can no longer stop the pawn from queening.
598,22,40,Rb8,b'1r6/1P4pk/5p1p/1K6/R7/8/8/8 w - -',Black's rook has made it to the square it wants and it is now up to my king to catch up to it before it can come back to prevent this mass run of pawns.
599,22,41,4Kxb7,b'8/1K4pk/5p2/7p/R7/8/8/8 b - -',Okay so here it is. Three pawns and a king vs a rook and a king. Who wins? I'm a fairly nervous at this point; I don't know if three pawns can push past a rook but I'm confident if I can get my king back to the action that I can at least force a draw. Worse case scenario I'm going to sacrifice my rook for the f and g-pawns knowing that with two kings and a rook pawn in the corner... it is only likely to be a draw.
600,22,42,Kf5,b'8/8/5p2/3K1kpp/R7/8/8/8 w - -',These last two moves really weakened my score on GK analysis. Maybe it is because it looks even more like a draw with the kings in this position.
601,22,43,Kf3,b'8/8/5p2/6pp/R7/3K1k2/8/8 w - -',+0.02 on GK analysis and very much a draw until Black's next move.
602,22,44,f5,b'8/8/R7/5ppp/8/3K1k2/8/8 w - -',This is the first mistake from my opponent in the endgame. I have to commend my opponent as by saving his f-pawn he is clearly showing that he is trying to win the game. However it is in vain and 54. h4 would have given him an easy draw.
603,22,45,5Ra5,b'8/8/8/R4ppp/8/3K1k2/8/8 b - -',The king is now forced onto the 4th rank to protect it's pawns and allows my king into e2. 
604,22,46,5Ke2,b'8/8/8/R4ppp/6k1/8/4K3/8 b - -',From this position I am very confident I will get a draw minimum. Black's pawns are lined up his king placed in front of them and my king has arrived on the scene.
605,22,47,5f4,b'8/8/8/R5pp/5pk1/8/4K3/8 w - -',Another mistake - I knew here that I was winning a pawn... and without giving Black the compensation of time to threaten with pawn pushes.
606,22,48,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/R5pp/5pk1/8/5K2/8 b - -',Black's options - 1) 57... Kh3 58. Rxg5 the f-pawn is easily targeted and White can mop up the h-pawn easily enough. 2) 57... Kh4 58. Kf3 g4+ 59. Kxf4 g3 60. Kf3 g2 61. Kxg2 or 60... Kh3 61. Rxh5#. 3) 57... f3 I didn't analyse this much at the time but the f-pawn is lost to either Ra4+ or Ra3 (alternatively Rb5 wastes a tempo and forces to Black to move a pawn). I'd like to think I could take the two pawns apart with my rook though. The last possible move is 57... h4 which my opponent plays.
607,22,49,5Kg2,b'8/8/8/R5p1/5pkp/8/6K1/8 b - -',This is the killer move for White here. This looks like a position one might consider zugzwang with all of black's moves making his position worse. 1) 58... Kh5 59. Kh3 f3 60. Rf5 Kg6 61. Kg4 h3 62. Rxf3 h2 62. Rh3 and White wins. The win in the next position is a bit more subtle. 2) 58... h3 59. Kh2 Kh4 60. Ra4!! (White wants to play Ra3 but needs a waiting move and this stops Black from playing g4.) 60... Kg4 61. Ra3!... and White wins the h-pawn.
608,22,50,5f3+,b'8/8/8/R5p1/6kp/5p2/6K1/8 w - -',This gives White quite an easy time I think.
609,22,51,5Kf2,b'8/8/8/R5p1/6kp/5p2/5K2/8 b - -',If 59... Kh3 60. Rxg5 wins for White as long as White is careful about not giving Black a stalemate in the corner.
610,22,52,6Kxf3,b'8/8/8/6pk/R7/5K1p/8/8 b - -',61. Kg3 g4 62. Rxg4 as 62... h2 63. Rh4+ or 62... f2 63. Rf4 h2 64. Kxh2... both win too!
611,22,53,6Kg3,b'8/8/8/7k/R5p1/6Kp/8/8 b - -',My opponent resigned here... it was an interesting game that I don't feel I played great in but I enjoyed playing the endgame... it was only two errors in judgment of position that led to Black trying to force a win that helped me to get the win in this game. I hope you all enjoy analysing another game with an interesting endgame and I look forward to your comments.

But it is simple: 11... fxQ 12. g6 wins a (trapped) rook and restores my queen. Black can do nothing to avoid it. And if hxg Qxg6+ is not inmediate mate but I will win the rook in h8: Kf8 (not Ke7 Bg5+) RxRh8 and I win.

It may seem obvious but knowing the mechanics of the knight is important. Endgames with rooks and bishops are easier than knights because the movements of those pieces are a lot easier to predict (a LSB bishop isn't going to be able to use dark squares etc.).

A knight is much more complex; Firstly a knight cannot lose a tempo. I think it is VERY important to realise how long it takes a knight to maneuver from one square to another. For example to get my knight from f6 to d4 it will take a MINIMUM of 4 moves (eg. Ne8-c7-e6-d4). 

Finally endgames with knights require players to be careful where the kings are placed because with a tempo check the knight can quickly make it's way to tackle a lot of squares. The knight would be attacking a third movement square very quickly. If you consider a knight in the centre (d4 d5 e4 or e5) I believe the knight almost makes every square on the board in three moves."

Op grootmeester niveau zijn e2-e4 en d2-d4 ongeveer even populair. Bij amateurs is de gespeelde zet echter veel populairder. Laten we dus kijken naar de motivatie achter de zet: wat maakt e2-e4 zo sterk?
Ten eerste opent het diagonalen voor de konings-loper en dame zodat zij zich kunnen bewegen. Het is vooral van belang dat de loper zich verplaatst omdat het noodzakelijk is voor de rochade. Rocheren is erg belangrijk en dit zal meestal jouw doel moeten zijn in de opening.
Hierbij komt dat na e2-e4 wit een pion in het centrum (de velden e4/e5/d4/d5 vormen samen het centrum van het schaakbord) heeft staan die de veld d5 aanvalt. Centrum-controle krijgen is een ander doel in de schaakopening hoewel het minder belangrijk is als koningsveiligheid of stuk-activiteit."

Een ongebruikelijke maar erg interessante zet. In deze posite wordt normaal gerocheerd of d2-d3 gespeeld. Met Pc3-d5 maakt zwart zijn paard nog actiever en hij geeft zichzelf de optie om op b4 of f6 te nemen. Omdat de paard de pion op e4 niet meer dekt kan de zwarte paard op f6 de pion op e4 nemen. De pion wordt echter op een indirecte manier verdedigd. Als zwart de pion op e4 neemt speelt wit zijn dame naar e2. Vanuit e2 valt de dame de zwarte paard op e4 aan en als deze paard teruggaat kan wit nemen op e5. Na deze zetten zou materiaal gelijk zijn maar wit heeft actievere stukken en dus een lichte voordeel."

Wit heeft na deze zet wel de optie om de loper op b4 te nemen met zijn paard (Pd5xb4). Nadat zwart terugneemt met zijn paard (Pc5xb4) kan wit de pion op e5 pakken. Deze variatie zal echter niet leiden tot een voordeel voor wit omdat zwart hierna zijn toren op de e-lijn kan zetten (Tf8-e8). Wanneer de Paard weggaat (Pe4-f3) kan zwart de pion op e4 nemen en materiaal is weer gelijk.

Zwart besluit zijn Paard af te ruilen voor de pion op f2. Hoewel de witte koning hierdoor kwetsbaarder wordt is deze zet toch een fout. Om een koning aan te vallen en mat te zetten heb je meerdere stukken nodig. De dame alleen kan een koning niet matzetten en heeft ondersteuning nodig. Omdat je hierna twee stukken minder hebt als de tegenstander wordt het onmogelijk om een winnende aanval op te zetten tegen de witte koning. "

Na e5-e4 valt de zwarte pion de paard aan en jaagt dus een verdediger van de koning weg. Omdat zwart zoveel materiaal achter staat moet hij wel voor een aanval gaan. "
861,31,14,Qh4+,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/3N4/1PB1p2q/8/1PPP1KPP/R1BQN2R w - -',"De zwarte dame valt de koning aan. Dit wordt schaak genoemt en wit is nu gedwongen om de schaak/aanval op te heffen. Het zal rond dit punt zijn dat jij dacht goede kansen te hebben. De waarheid is echter dat jij hier verloren staat. De dame kan de koning aanvallen (schaak zetten) maar hij kan niet de koning schaakmat zetten. Hij heeft te weinig ondersteuning van zijn stukken en wit kan al vrij snel zijn koning in veiligheid brengen.
Schaakmat (of simpel mat) is het einddoel van een partij schaken. Als de witte koning wordt matgezet is de partij over en heeft zwart gewonnen. Om de koning schaakmat te zetten moet jij hem aanvallen (schaak zetten) zonder dat de tegenstander het schaak op enig manier kan opheffen (weglopen met de koning de aanvallende stuk nemen iets tussen aanvaller en koning zetten). In dit geval is er geen sprake van schaakmat omdat wit uit de aanval kan komen."

Niet echt een mooie zet in mijn mening. De witte koning wordt hierdoor nog meer open en wit moet vanaf nu een beetje oppasssen. Na deze zet valt de pion op g3 wel de zwarte dame aan en de dame zal dus een nieuwe veld op moeten zoeken."

Helaas een foutje maar ik kan het jou niet kwalijk nemen. Een toren is normaal meer waard dan een paard en dus zou de afruil gunstig moeten zijn voor jou. In dit geval echter is de zwarte paard veel meer waard dan de witte toren want zwart heeft hem nodig voor de aanval. De pad naar winst is echter moeilijk te zien. 
Ik denk dat na d5 (in plaats van Pg3xh1) zwart goede kansen zou hebben gehad op een overwinning. Hier een voorbeeld variatie:
- Zwart speelt d7-d5. Het opent de weg voor de loper om mee te doen aan de aanval en het valt de loper aan op c4.
- Witte loper neemt d5 (Lc4xd5)
- Zwarte loper gaat naar g4 en valt de witte dame op d1 aan. (Lc8-g4)
- Wit neemt de paard op g3 (h2xg3)
- Zwarte dame neemt terug op g3 en valt de koning aan. (Dh4xg3+)
- Witte paard gaat naar g2 om de aanval op de koning te stoppen (Pe1-g2)
- Zwarte loper neemt de witte dame (Lg4xd1). Hierna staat zwart veel beter."

Ook hier is d7-d5 sterker. De zwarte dame heeft ondersteuning nodig om de witte koning mat te kunnen zetten. Hoewel Dh4-f2 er sterk uitziet is dit waarschijnlijk een behoorlijke fout. Hierna heeft zwart geen goede aanvalskansen meer."

Omdat wit meer materiaal heeft is het gunstig voor hem om de dames af te ruilen. Zwart heeft immers zijn dame nodig voor de aanval op de witte koning.

Met de dames van het bord heeft zwart geen kans meer maar na iets als Df2-f6 zou zwart waarschijnlijk ook weinig kans hebben. Ik zal voor de rest van de partij geen commentaar meer geven want de partij is hierna min of meer over. 

Een samenvatting:
Beide spelers begonnen de partij goed en de eerste fout werd gemaakt toen zwart besloot om twee stukken weg te geven voor twee pionnen. Hierna had zwart wel aanvalskansen tegen de witte koning maar niet voldoende als wit correct zou spelen. Door een paar fouten van wit krijgt zwart echter mogelijkheden. Vooral d7-d5 leek een sterke optie in deze fase. Nadat zwart deze kans mist zorgt wit voor de afruil van de dames waarna zijn koning niet meer in gevaar is. De extra 3 stukken die hij heeft wint hierna de partij. 

Tips:
- Let op materiaal. Als je een stuk laat nemen wees zeker dat je er genoeg voor terug krijgt.
- Voor een geslaagde koningsaanval heb je meerdere stukken nodig die samenwerken om de koning te bedreigen."

900,32,27,Nc4,b'8/4rk2/1p6/p2P4/2n2N2/8/5K2/1R6 w - -',57. ..... Nc4 - now that the dust has settled I am a pawn up and white only has his passed d4 pawn but white still has a strong knight so he is still in the game.

903,32,30,Kd6,b'8/1r6/1p1kN3/3P4/p1n5/6K1/8/3R4 w - -',64. ..... Kd6 - Henry deftly avoids the annoying checks from white's rook and knight by hiding behind the white pawn on d5.  Sometimes enemy pawns can be very useful shields for kings as the enemy cannot capture their own pawns!
904,32,31,Nxd5,b'8/1r6/1p1k4/3n2N1/p7/3R2K1/8/8 w - -',66. .... Nxd5 - I do take off the d5 pawn and now white has nothing to promote.  Meanwhile I am now a clear two pawns up and determined to make it count.
905,32,32,Kc6,b'8/1r6/2k5/1p1n4/p3N3/R5K1/8/8 w - -',68. .... Kc6 - a point worth mentioning here.  If you do not want your king to be checked by a knight move him two squares diagonally from it.  You could also put the king one square adjacent but NOT diagonally adjacent to the knight.  It will take a few moves for the knight to manouevre itself to check your king.
906,32,33,b4,b'8/r7/2k5/3n4/pp2N3/R7/4K3/8 w - -',70. .... b4 - the two black pawnies now get involved in a race to Glendadom.

908,32,35,a2,b'8/r7/2k5/3n4/4N3/8/pp6/1R1K4 w - -',74. .... a2 - white must now give up ruinous amounts of material to avoid dealing with Glenda.
909,32,36,7Nd2,b'8/1r6/2k5/3n4/8/8/1p1N4/1K6 b - -',77. Nd2 - trying to stop my remaining pawn from crowning but even if he does a rook is sufficient to force checkmate.
910,32,37,7Kxc3,b'8/1r6/2k5/8/8/2K5/3N4/1q6 b - -',79.  Kxc3 - interesting he keeps the knight on the board but allows Glenda to breathe.  She will give him cause to regret this.
911,32,38,Qxd2,b'8/3r4/2k5/8/4K3/8/3q4/8 w - -',81. .... Qxd2 - white is left with just his king.  Now I must avoid the wrong kind of mate!
912,32,39,Kd5,b'8/3r4/8/3k1K2/3q4/8/8/8 w - -',83. .... Kd5 - Henry helps in the driving back process.  The WK will be driven to the h column.
913,32,40,Qf4+,b'8/3r4/8/4k1K1/5q2/8/8/8 w - -',85. .... Qf4+ - closer and closer.
914,32,41,Kf6,b'8/3r4/5k1K/8/8/6q1/8/8 w - -',87. ...... Kf6 - Henry plays his part well.  White was hoping for Qg4 stalemate.  Not a chance.  White now cops old Matey next move.  Both Glenda and the rook have a bit of a stand-off about who will deliver the Coup De Grace.  Henry plays referee and commands that it is the rook's turn for this royal honour.  Whew what a marathon!  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

1092,38,4,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np4/1ppn1P2/4P3/1P4N1/PBP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',If the knight is doomed it will go down fighting.
1093,38,5,Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p4/1ppPnP2/8/1P4N1/PBP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Move knight to block white's bishop on the main diagonal.
1094,38,6,1c4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p4/1ppPnP2/2P5/1P4N1/PB2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - c3',White advances a pawn to disrupt my queenside pawn structure.
1095,38,7,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p4/2pPnP2/1pP5/1P4N1/PB2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Instead of exchanging I just push past the pawn to maintain the pawn line.
1096,38,8,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/5ppp/p2p4/2pPnPbB/1pP5/1P4N1/PB1Q2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Move bishop out to threaten the queen.
1097,38,9,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/5ppp/p2p4/2pPnPbB/1pP5/1P4N1/PB2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Move rook to where I can make a discovered attack on the queen by moving the knight.
1098,38,10,2Ne4,b'r1bqr1k1/5ppp/p2p4/2pPnPbB/1pP1N3/1P6/PB2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',That move removes the option for a discovered rook attack on the queen and also threatens the bishop.
1099,38,11,2Qc2,b'r2qr1k1/3b1ppp/p2p1b2/2pPnP1B/1pP1N3/1P6/PBQ3PP/4RRK1 b - -',The pawn on d6 was unprotected for a move but apparently white didn't see it. Or had other plans.
1100,38,12,2Rxf5,b'rq2r1k1/2b2p1p/3p1Pp1/p1pPnRP1/1pP1N3/1P6/PB4QP/3BR1K1 b - -',Exchange rook for bishop? It does disrupt the king's defense and allows white to pick off the f6 pawn.
1101,38,13,Nd3,b'rq2r1k1/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP5/1P1n2N1/PB4QP/3BR1K1 w - -',Knight jumps to an unprotected square behind enemy lines and forking rook and bishop.
1102,38,14,Qxe8,b'r3q1k1/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP5/1P1n2N1/PB4QP/3B2K1 w - -',The rook exchange was white's best response to the knight fork. The rook would have been lost anyway so it might as well take out an enemy rook with it.
1103,38,15,Qe1+,b'r5k1/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP5/1P1n1BN1/PB4QP/4q1K1 w - -',Now the queen comes behind enemy lines.
1104,38,16,3Nf1,b'r5k1/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP5/1P1n1B2/PB4QP/4qNK1 b - -',This is white's best move. If white blocked with the queen (Qf1) then after a queen exchange the bishop on b2 would have been left unprotected.
1105,38,17,Qh4,b'r5k1/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP4q/1P3B2/PQ5P/5NK1 w - -',The intent here is to take out the g5 pawn with either queen or rook.
1106,38,18,Kh8,b'r6k/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP4q/1P3B2/P5QP/5NK1 w - -',Move king aside to allow rook to align itself with white's queen and king.
1107,38,19,3Qg3,b'r6k/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pP4q/1P3BQ1/P6P/5NK1 b - -',White prefers a queen exchange instead. The exchange would leave white's pawn on g5 unprotected but would also allow white to pick off my pawns on f5 and f7 with the bishop or knight.
1108,38,20,3Qd4+,b'r6k/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pPq4/1P3BQ1/P6P/5NK1 w - -',So I decided against the queen exchange.
1109,38,21,3Kg2,b'r6k/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pP1pP1/1pPq4/1P3BQ1/P5KP/5N2 b - -',With white's king on g2 I could push the pawn on a5 to open up the a column and bring my rook behind enemy lines as well. However that would take a couple of moves to play out and it would give white tempo. As long as I have tempo I might as well use it.
1110,38,22,Rg8,b'6rk/2b2p1p/3p1P2/p1pPqpP1/1pP5/1P3BN1/P4QKP/8 w - -',At last I can move the rook into place!
1111,38,23,4Bh5,b'6rk/2b2p2/3p1P1p/p1pPqpPB/1pP4P/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 b - -',White wants to take out the pawn on f7 and prevent the rook from checking the white king.
1112,38,24,4hxg5,b'6rk/2b2p2/3p1P2/p1pPqppB/1pP4P/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 w - -',But before white takes out f7 I want to disrupt the white's kingside pawn defense.
1113,38,25,Rf8,b'5r1k/2b2B2/3p1P2/p1pPqpp1/1pP4P/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 w - -',Now the rook can threaten the bishop and the pawn on f6.
1114,38,26,Rxf6,b'7k/2b5/3p1rB1/p1pPqpp1/1pP4P/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 w - -',Rook takes out pawn and threatens bishop.
1115,38,27,4Bxf5,b'7k/2b5/3p1r2/p1pPqBp1/1pP4P/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 b - -',Bishop moves to where two of its own can protect it ...
1116,38,28,4gxh4,b'7k/2b5/3p1r2/p1pPqB2/1pP4p/1P4N1/P4QK1/8 w - -',So I threaten one of the bishop's protectors. If white moves the knight the rook can take the bishop. White who is already down 3 points opts to resign instead.
1117,39,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',In things like League or Ladder games I vary my openings. But in tournament or mini-tournament games I usually stick to more Classical lines as in this game.
1118,39,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Yet another Ruy Lopez. :)

1121,39,4,Nxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3Nn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',A pseudo-sacrifice as the pin on the K file wins back the Knight at once.

1126,39,9,1Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p5/3p4/3p1B2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - -',The best spot.
1127,39,10,1Bxd6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pB4/3p4/3p4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - -',Since I'm ahead in material I don't at all mind exchanges.
1128,39,11,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pq4/3p4/3p4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',The last minor piece clears the rank...

1133,39,16,1Qh3,b'4brk1/p5pp/1ppq4/3p1p2/3p4/3B3Q/PPPN1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',So that I can play...
1134,39,17,1Bxf5,b'4brk1/p5pp/1pp4q/3p1B2/3p4/7Q/PPPN1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',...this move without moving into a self-pin. 19... QxQ 20 BxQ would let me win slowly but surely.
1135,39,18,2Bxh7+,b'4brk1/p5pB/1pp5/3p4/3p4/7Q/PPPq1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Now I win quickly. Black's only way to fight on is 20... K-R1 21 B-N6 dis ch Q-R3 22 QxQ ch PxQ 23 BxB after which I have an easy endgame win but Black can drag out his resistance for a while.
1136,39,19,2Qe6#,b'4br2/p4kpB/1pp1Q3/3p4/3p4/8/PPPq1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Black's actual move enables me to end it right here.
