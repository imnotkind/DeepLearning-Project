0,0,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sicilian Defense black's most common and highest scoring reply. Known both for its dynamic games and high following among top players the Sicilian is often the defense for people who love aggressive games and don't mind studying a lot of theory
1,0,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The most common moves here are 3. d4 (The Open Sicilian) and moves like 3. Bb5+ (The Moscow Variation) however my opponent played this Bc4 move. I always see this move yet I feel it's basically handing Black equalization as Black can usually build up a nice center with ...e6 and ...d5 to follow (which would also kick the c4 bishop with tempo).
2,0,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',My standard response preparing ...e6 and ...d5 plus developing.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I could have played e6 here but I usually prefer to develop my Queen's Knight first.
4,0,4,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',And my plan starts to take action.
5,0,5,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/1Bp5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Perhaps he noticed d5 was coming and just evacuated early but this is the loss of tempo I described earlier.
6,0,6,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/1Bp5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I decided to make him move one more time and I welcome the exchange since the doubled pawns will only bolster the center I am about to erect plus it opens up a b-file that will be great for my rook.
7,0,7,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pppn2/2p3B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Again wanting to trade off bishop for knight maybe my opponent loves his horses.
8,0,8,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I ignore it this time and finally play ...d5
9,0,9,cxd5,b'r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p3pq2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',After the smoke clears I no longer have doubled pawns but a very strong center an semi-open b file and the bishop pair.
10,0,10,Bd6,b'r1b1k2r/5ppp/p2bpq2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Developing and pointing straight towards the king's castled position.
11,0,11,Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/5ppp/p2bpq2/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I was debating whether I should do this move or wait until the c-file opened up and use that instead. I chose this in the end because I would have another rook to come over to the c-file and the control of both half-open files. Along with the bishop pair in an open position I figured I would serve extremely well.
12,0,12,cxd4,b'1rb2rk1/5ppp/p2bpq2/3p4/3p4/1PN2N2/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Opening up the c file and the position in general. This is always good when you have the bishop pair as bishops thrive in open positions whereas knights love closed positions. 
13,0,13,Qxd4,b'1rb2rk1/5ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3q4/1PN2N2/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I played this partly because this was a timed game and I couldn't think of any great squares to move my Queen to on the spot. Besides I figured the prospects I already had should serve me well enough.
14,0,14,Bd7,b'1r3rk1/3b1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/3N4/1PN5/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Connecting the rooks and preparing Rfc8
15,0,15,1Nf3,b'1r3rk1/3b1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/8/1PN2N2/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?! I wasn't sure of this move it seems as if it's just wasting tempo. Maybe my opponent was preparing to redirect his knight to e5 and try to exchange the knight for my bishop?
16,0,16,1Rfc8,b'1rr3k1/3b1ppp/p2bp3/3p4/8/1PN2N2/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Enacting my plan and also attacking the undefended c3 knight. If I can get this knight to move I win a pawn on c2.
17,0,17,Bb4,b'1rr3k1/3b1ppp/p3p3/3p4/1b6/1PN1RN2/P1P2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Attacking the knight once again it has to move now.
18,0,18,Rxc2,b'1r4k1/3b1ppp/p3p3/3p4/1b6/1P2RN2/P1r1NPPP/R5K1 w - -',There goes the pawn.
19,0,19,2Nfd4,b'1r4k1/3b1ppp/p3p3/3p4/1b1N4/1P2R3/P1r1NPPP/R5K1 b - -',Funny how the same knight comes right back to d4 anyway.
20,0,20,2Rc7,b'1r4k1/2rb1ppp/p3p3/3p4/1b1N4/1P2R3/P3NPPP/R5K1 w - -',I chose c7 and not c8 since I wanted to double rooks on the now fully open c-file anyway so going back to c8 just to come to c7 made no sense.
21,0,21,Ba7,b'1r4k1/b1rb1ppp/p3p3/3p4/1P1N4/P3R3/4NPPP/R5K1 w - -',My bishop got kicked around a bit however it came at the cost of weakening his queenside. I also managed to keep my sights on the a7-g1 diagonal meaning the knight on d4 needs to stay put or else my opponent will be down the exchange.
22,0,22,Bb5,b'1r4k1/b1r2ppp/p3p3/1b1p4/1P1N4/P4R2/4NPPP/R5K1 w - -',My LSB wasn't finding any good squares and so I don't mind trading it off for his knight.
23,0,23,2h4,b'1r4k1/b1r2ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1P5P/P4R2/4NPP1/R5K1 b - h3',? White needs to turn his full attention to the queenside or else he'll simply get steamrolled.
24,0,24,2Rc2,b'1r4k1/b4ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1P5P/P4R2/2r1NPP1/R5K1 w - -',Rooks on the 7th rank are happy rooks. This move also comes with tempo since the knight can't go to d4 without it's twin knight protecting it.
25,0,25,Rbc8,b'2r3k1/b4ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1P3N1P/P4R2/2r2PP1/R5K1 w - -',Doubled rooks on the only fully open file soon enough I will storm into White's camp and gobble up all he's good for.
26,0,26,2Kh2,b'2r3k1/b4ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1P3N1P/P4R2/2r2PPK/R7 b - -',Perhaps trying to avoid trading rooks after 27.--- 27...Rc1+ but this option just drops a pawn
27,0,27,Bxf2,b'2r3k1/5ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1P3N1P/P7/5bPK/R7 w - -',The bishop hiding on a7 jumps back into action.
28,0,28,Rc4,b'6k1/5ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1Pr2N1P/P6K/5bP1/R7 w - -',Compare the pieces here. My rook is active on an open file and attacking pieces. Meanwhile White's is currently staring at a brick wall on a3. My bishop has a lot of movement through my pawns and a lot of pawns of White's to attack. Meanwhile White's knight isn't doing a whole lot and it doesn't really have anywhere good to go.
29,0,29,Bb2,b'6k1/5ppp/4p3/1p1p4/1Pr2N1P/P5PK/1b6/5R2 w - -',White's a and b pawns were going to fall and I would then have 3 passed pawns to run to queening squares. Due to all of this my opponent resigned in this position. I hope you enjoyed my commentary please comment with any lines I may have missed or any improvements in general!
30,1,0,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',"All the games start here. The Grand Prix Attack is a lot of things but ""boring"" isn't one of them."
31,1,1,1Qxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/5P2/2NP1Q1P/PPP3P1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',The game is already getting interesting. My opponent has elected to exchange minor pieces on KB6. As a result of the exchange I now have a threat to win a Pawn by 11 BxN ch PxB 12 QxP ch.
32,1,2,1Qd6,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/2nq1n2/1Bp5/5P2/2NP1Q1P/PPP3P1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black defends the threat and centralizes the Queen nicely.
33,1,3,a6,b'2kr1b1r/1p2pppp/p1nq1n2/1Bp5/5P2/2NP1QPP/PPPB4/R4RK1 w - -',Forcing a decision.
34,1,4,bxc6,b'2kr1b1r/4pppp/p1pq1n2/2p5/5P2/2NP1QPP/PPPB4/R4RK1 w - -',Both Kings are now somewhat exposed.
35,1,5,Qd4+,b'2kr1b1r/4pppp/p1p2n2/2p5/N2q1P2/3P1QPP/PPPB4/R4RK1 w - -',With this nice tactical shot Black wins a piece.

37,1,7,2Re5,b'2k1rb1r/1q3ppp/p1p1pn2/B1p1R3/2P2P2/1P1P1QPP/P6K/R7 b - -',I haven't given up hope. Despite being a piece down there is enough wood left on the board to provoke complications.

40,1,10,2Rab1,b'2k3r1/1q2rp2/p1p1p1p1/2p4p/2P2P1P/1P1P1QP1/P6K/1R2R3 b - -',All the minor pieces are gone. I feel I have a decent shot in the all-heavy-piece end game due to my better Q-side Pawn position.

44,1,14,3Rxf6,b'6r1/2k1r3/p4Rp1/2p1P2p/2P4P/1P4P1/P6K/4R3 b - -',Now I'm two pawns up and have a passed KP. I feel my chances have improved significantly.
45,1,15,3Rxa5,b'6r1/1k2r3/6p1/R1p1P2p/2P4P/1P4P1/P6K/4R3 b - -',Now I have a second passed Pawn.
46,1,16,4axb4,b'6r1/4r3/1k4p1/R3P2p/1PP4P/6P1/7K/4R3 b - -',With connected passed Q-side Pawns it's a matter of technique now.

In addition castling King Side would not have been much better because I am attacking from that direction.  However I am still going to win a free pawn with 15...Qxf3.  Therefore things will be even.  BTW this is the danger of having a ""double pawn"".  In other words two weak pawns allows you to capture one of those free pawns in most circumstances.  There are exceptions but this is not one of them."

That is because I will make 17...PxQ illegal.  As a result I will sac my rook and win an extra piece with 17...Rxc3 18.bxc3 Qxc3.  Consequently I will be 8 points ahead after the exchange.  This is btw where I applied the biggest chess tactic training because this position is almost identical to one of the exercises.

However he is wrong because I will win his e4 pawn by placing him in check with 21.Nxe4+.  Therefore I will be 9 points ahead instead of 8.  In addition 21.f3 is the only move that would have saved his pawn.     
186,7,29,2Ke2,b'4kb1r/4pppp/p2p4/8/4n3/q3B3/2P1KP1P/R6R b k -',22.Kd1 or 22.Ke1 were his only other choices.  However 22.Ke1 is the only other move that would have protected his f2 pawn.
187,7,30,2Qb2,b'4kb1r/4pppp/p2p4/8/4n3/4B3/1qP1KP1P/R6R w k -',I also could have played 22.Nc3+ but it would be a nuisance check.  Therefore I would waste my time if I placed my opponent in check because I am not trying to overwhelm at this point.  That will come later.  On the other hand I am attacking his c2 pawn and that is the reason that I did not retreat my queen or place him in check.
188,7,31,2Rhc1,b'4kb1r/4pppp/p2p4/8/4n3/4B3/1qP1KP1P/R1R5 b k -',! This is very solid because it protects his c2 pawn and prevents me from finding an immediate mating sequence.  If he had not moved his rook I might have found an immediate mating pattern with my knight and queen after 23...QxP.

I will continue to check him in my attempt to find a mating pattern.  Even if it is a nuisance check that does not mate him I want to continue because of my ""Scare Tactics"".  What do ""Scare Tactics"" mean?  A ""Scare Tactic"" is a strategy that is used to make your opponent feel anxious.  In other words I want him to get nervous and worried so that he will make mistakes and that is btw my strategy.  If I am successful I will be able to mate him quickly and that will happen during the end of this game.  This is how ubermensch43 defeated me in a coaching game.  Although he did not mate me he preoccupied my defenses so I was forced to resign in the second game. "

192,7,35,Qh5+,b'4kb1r/4pppp/p2p4/7q/4n3/4B3/2P1KP1P/R1R5 w k -',? Therefore I decided to take advantage by placing him in another check because I am still trying to preoccupy him.  However this is a mistake and I will explain it shortly.
193,7,36,2f3,b'4kb1r/4pppp/p2p4/7q/4n3/4BP2/2P1K2P/R1R5 b k -',When I played 25...Qh5+ I originally thought that he would be forced to move his queen.  However I forgot about his f2 so I just wasted a move.

He probably moved his c1 rook to prevent a fork because he was worried that I was going to play a powerful fork with Bb2 ""sooner or later"" as it is said.  However I was not interested in playing a fork because I had better plans. "
196,7,39,2Bg7,b'4k2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/7q/4n3/4BP2/2P1K2P/R4R2 w k -',? I also could have played Bh6 instead of Fianchettoing my DSB.  However I did not want to exchange bishops.  I wanted to exchange his rook for my bishop instead.  On the other hand I missed an immediate mating sequence.  I could have mated him in about two or three moves if I had played 27...Nc3+.
197,7,40,2Kd3,b'4k2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/7q/4n3/3KBP2/2P4P/R4R2 b k -',He moved his king so that I could not play 28...Nc3+.  However I still have a couple more tricks.

I could have captured his rook with 28...Bxa1 but I decided to place him another check so that he would feel overwhelmed.  Unlike before I will be successful this time.  I will explain it this shortly. "
199,7,42,2Bd4,b'4k2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/3q4/3Bn3/3K1P2/2P4P/R4R2 b k -',"?? I originally thought he would be forced to play 29.Ke2.  Then if 29.Ke2 29...Bxa1 winning his rook.  If I had taken his rook I still would have used ""Scare Tactics"" until he felt preoccupied.  However ""This looses immediately"" as Jack Stockel would say.  That is because I now have an inevitable mating sequence against him and I will mate in 2.  The solution is 29...Qxd4+ 30.Ke2 (forced) 30...Qd2#.  In addition this is where I applied the final chess tactic training because I was able to complete an exercise with a similar mating solution. "
200,7,43,Qd2#,b'4k2r/4ppbp/p2p2p1/8/4n3/5P2/2PqK2P/R4R2 w k -',I used to do chess tactic exercises but I failed the excercise many times. Therefore I stopped doing them at one point.  However I gave it another chance because I had to miss the chess club with Mr. Stockel for a month.  As a result started to do the exercises and I am getting better each time. In some cases I am able to complete 5 consecutive exercises (5 exercises in a row). I feel that it is also helping me to become better at this game because some of the exercises have similar positions to what Mr. Stockel teaches. In addition I am using some of these tactics in my games and it is making a huge difference.  In fact I have remembered them to defeat a couple of opponents.  This game is an example.

A chess game will have drama intrigue tragedy comedy. Think of it as a theatre of the mind where we play major roles in shaping our destiny.  It is life contained on a 64 square field and we are the Kings.

490,19,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"Hi everyone!

This game started very slowly with little advantage to Yours Truly until late on in the middlegame white blundered a pawn.  I took full advantage but I still had to work hard for that win.  Thanfully Fou Leblanc with the aid of Henry managed to lure his counterpart onto a diagonal which led to an exchange down into a K & P ending and I then managed to get Henry right up into his arc.  Henry duly tucked in to his favourite nosh and it was inevitable that he was gonna help a pawn get to the 8th rank and inflict Glendadoom on his opponent.  Chris realised this and resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  How did all this happen?  Well Gameknot Analysis will shed some light on the matter: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17359307&fb=1&rnd=0.8334781184207715."
491,19,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',1. ..... d5 - the game starts with a double QP opening.
492,19,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ...... dxc4 - the QGA accepted.
493,19,3,Bxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2BP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',4. Bxc4 - there is no good way to hold on to my extra pawn but I will somehow get a free and fairly easy game just watch.
494,19,4,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2p5/2BP4/4PN2/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',6. ..... a6 - I am trying a breakout with the idea of b5.  I do get this move in 2 moves later.
495,19,5,Bxc5,b'rnbqk2r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2b5/2B5/4PN2/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',7. ...... Bxc5 - but first we have a pawn trade.  Although I am a bit behind in development it looks as though I may be able to put my pieces on decent squares without too much interference from white.
496,19,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/5ppp/p3p3/1pb1n3/4P3/3B4/PP1NQPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',12. ...... Nxe5 - knight trade.
497,19,7,Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/5ppp/pq2p3/1pb1n3/4P3/8/PPBNQPPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',14. ..... Qb6 - Aha here comes Glenda.  Glenda and Fou Lenoir are both putting pressure on the f2 pawn.  Now all I need to do is clear the decks with either Bb7 or Bd7.
498,19,8,1Qxf3,b'r1b2rk1/5ppp/pq2p3/1pb5/4P3/5Q2/PPB2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',16. Qxf3 - another knight trade.
499,19,9,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/1b3ppp/pq2p3/1pb5/4P3/5Q2/PPB2PPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',16. ..... Bb7 - b7 I choose you!  Already the white pawn on e4 is pinned to the Wicked Witch of the West.
500,19,10,1fxe3,b'r4rk1/1b3ppp/p3p3/1p6/4P3/4P3/PPB3PP/R2R2K1 b - -',19. fxe3 - hmm after the queen trade white is left with doubled pawns.  But how can I exploit this?  Thankfully my opponent soon helps me out.
501,19,11,2Rd1,b'3r2k1/1b3ppp/p3p3/1p6/4P3/4P3/PPB3PP/3R2K1 b - -',21. Rd1? - a natural move neutralising the d column but .......
502,19,12,2Bxd1,b'6k1/1b3ppp/p3p3/1p6/4P3/4P3/PP4PP/3B2K1 b - -',22.  Bxd1 - but look at that e4 pawn that Fou Leblanc has set his eyes on.  Now that white's lsb has moved to d1 it is no longer defending that e4 pawn.  Now that p(r)awn is about to grace Henry's table! 
503,19,13,2Bxe4,b'6k1/5ppp/p3p3/1p6/4b3/4P3/PP4PP/3B2K1 w - -',22. ..... Bxe4 - yum yum!
504,19,14,Kf8,b'5k2/5ppp/p3p3/1p6/4b3/P3P3/1P4PP/3B2K1 w - -',23. .... Kf8 - and now Henry gets quickly into the centre as there are no major pieces on the board.
505,19,15,Ke5,b'8/5ppp/p3p3/1p2k3/4b3/PB2P1P1/1P3K1P/8 w - -',26. ..... Ke5 - Henry has managed to do a few miles for Macmillan but what next?
506,19,16,b4,b'8/6pp/4p3/p3kp2/Pp2b3/1B2P1P1/1P3K1P/8 w - -',29. ...... b4 - I eschew the pawn trade because I have an idea up my sleeve.
507,19,17,3Bb5,b'8/6pp/4p3/pB1bkp2/Pp6/4P1P1/1P3K1P/8 b - -',31. Bb5 - naturally white declines the bishop trade but notice white's queenside pawns have been momentarily separated.  I will exploit this fact in the next two moves.
508,19,18,Bc6,b'8/6pp/2bkp3/pB3p2/Pp6/4P1P1/1P2K2P/8 w - -',32. ..... Bc6 - white must trade bishops or he loses the a4 pawn giving me a two pawn lead.
509,19,19,Kxc6,b'8/6pp/2k1p3/p4p2/Pp6/4P1P1/1P2K2P/8 w - -',33. .... Kxd6 - so white trades but I now have a K & P ending one pawn to the good and now Henry is Moving on Up!
510,19,20,g5,b'8/7p/4p3/p2k1pp1/Pp6/1P1KP1P1/7P/8 w - g6',35. ..... g4 - preparing to put white in a zugzwang.
511,19,21,g4,b'8/8/4p3/p2k1p1p/Pp4pP/1P1KP1P1/8/8 w - -',37. ..... g4 - now here is the zugzwang.  Although there is no further material loss for white at the moment his king has got to retreat allowing Henry to penetrate to e4.  Henry is licking his lips big time!
512,19,22,Kd3,b'8/8/4p3/p4p1p/Pp4pP/1P1kP1P1/5K2/8 w - -',39. ....... Kd3 - now Henry heads towards the pawn on b3.  However it is the e3 pawn that will be for his consumption.
513,19,23,Kxe3,b'8/8/4p3/p4p1p/Pp4pP/1P2k1P1/8/5K2 w - -',40. ....... Kxe3 - munch munch!
514,19,24,Kd2,b'8/8/8/p4p1p/Pp2p1pP/1P4P1/3k2K1/8 w - -',43. ..... Kd2 - Henry clears the e pawn's march to Glendadom.  Chris plays on for one more move before waving the white flag.  I did set up some conditional moves but Chris saved me the bother.  Another instructive way of forcing victory if you are ahead in an endgame.  Hope you are all enjoying your weekend - more to come - bye for now - Joanne

552,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I had a trio of games with this opponent. The first one I made a physical error around the 15th move and moved the wrong pawn (i seem to come up with a lot of different ways to lose a chess game.) The second game I won but only because he hung his bishop. I think it bothered him as near the end of that game he challenged me to a third game which is the one I'm annotating here. It was my best game of the three. I'm currently learning some new openings. The English Defense and her cousin the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. This is an English defense...Please forgive my annotations. I am a very self-absorbed person and focus on the things that are going on in my own head during a game. I'm sure my opponents would have their own slant on things. A chess game is a fight a war and a drama that unfolds on a 64 square field where we are the kings and the masters of our own fate.
553,21,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',When my opponent opens with d5 I usually respond with e6 when playing the English Defense as per Daniel King in his book on the English defense. He is up on these things much more than I...that's a good book by the way.
554,21,2,Bf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',7beaufeet7 my opponent likes the London System of developing his pieces. I'm also learning that system as well so I'm familiar with what he is trying to do here.
555,21,3,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',The English Defense like the Nimzo-Larsen involves fianchettoing the queen bishop.
556,21,4,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Welcome to the English Defense.
557,21,5,e3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',7beaufeet7 continues with his London style development which usually entails developing his pieces within a solid pawn structure. This tells me that he is more of a counter attacker like myself but in this game I become uncharacteristically aggressive. 
558,21,6,f5,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq f6',I strike out at the center. I'm trying to take control of the E4 square.
559,21,7,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpp2pp/1p2pn2/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',We continue to develop our pieces.
560,21,8,Na6,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp2pp/np2pn2/5p2/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',I never liked that move h3 but I see it all the time. I play my queen's knight to a6 not wanting to block my bishop. This move looks awkward but in replaying several master games of this defense I came upon this move being made again and again. I think it is just within the nature of this opening.
561,21,9,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pbpp2pp/np1bpn2/5p2/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',He castles and I do something I did in our first game I challenge his dark squared bishop with my own. As I said earlier  I'm familiar with the London System and I'm not going to let him have that diagonal.
562,21,10,cxd6,b'r2qk2r/pb1p2pp/np1ppn2/5p2/3P4/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',We exchange bishops and the pawns on my d file are doubled just as they were in our first game.

565,21,13,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pb1p2pp/np1ppn2/5p2/3P4/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',I grab the half open file with my rook which is also nicely protected by my bishop.
566,21,14,1c3,b'2rq1rk1/pb1p2pp/np1ppn2/5p2/3P4/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',He shuts down the file while strengthening his pawn structure. That is the classic London System pawn configuration. A very solid pawn skeleton. But I have ideas on how to crack it.
567,21,15,1Nbd2,b'2rq1rk1/pbnp2pp/1p1ppn2/5p2/3P4/2P1PN1P/PP1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',We both maneuver with our knights to get them in play.

569,21,17,fxe4,b'2rq1rk1/pbnp2pp/1p1pp3/8/3Pp3/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I saw this exchange coming now my e4 pawn drives his knight back into his own camp.
570,21,18,d5,b'2rq1rk1/pbnp2pp/1p2p3/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P2P/PP1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Just like our first game I push my pawn to d5 giving myself 2 sets of doubled pawns. My pawn structure in the center reminds me of a piece of DNA I liken it to a corkscrew. I'm going to attack White's pawn structure in waves of pawn advances. Notice both my rooks are on the half opened files vacated by my pawns.
571,21,19,1c4,b'2rq1rk1/pbnp2pp/1p2p3/3p4/2PPp3/4P2P/PP1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He plays c4 attacking my d5 pawn but also weakening his London style pawn structure.
572,21,20,1Qf6,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p2pq2/3p4/2PPp3/4P2P/PP1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I get my queen involved in things on the king side. I'm going to play her in behind my advancing pawns and try to push White back and take over more territory in the center.
573,21,21,e5,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p3q2/3pp3/2PPp3/4P2P/PP1NBPP1/2RQ1RK1 w - -',White develops his rook and I again attack his pawn center with e5.
574,21,22,Qxe5,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/3pq3/2P1p3/4P2P/PP1NBPP1/2RQ1RK1 w - -',I think I'm looking better here. I'm now threatening his b2 pawn. There's not much left of his center pawn structure now. I have a lot of space on the king side. My bishop is blocked but is also providing needed support for my d5 pawn.
575,21,23,d4,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/4q3/2Ppp3/4P2P/PPRNBPP1/3Q1RK1 w - -',He protects his pawn and I in turn push my pawn to d4. My advancing pawns are supported by my queen and my English bishop. Pretty aggressive for me. It's nice to see my strategy be realized during the game. The English defense and the Nimzo-Larsen can give you nice pawn structures in the middle game and make for creative original play...........by the way despite what I am thinking Fritz 8 my trusty Dr Watson rates things about even here.
576,21,24,Qxd4,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/8/2Pqp3/7P/PPRNBPP1/3Q1RK1 w - -',Another exchange. Look at the pawn structure now. I still have two center pawns (one in the center and the other ready to be advanced from d7). His position looks confined like three people in a single bed.)  I just have to follow through but ah that's another story.......Frtiz 8 still thinks it about even.
577,21,25,2Nb3,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/8/2Pqp3/1N5P/PPR1BPP1/3Q1RK1 b - -',White attacks my queen. Can't say I blame him.
578,21,26,2Qxd1,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/8/2P1p3/1N5P/PPR1BPP1/3q1RK1 w - -',I take his queen.
579,21,27,2Rxd1,b'2r2rk1/pbnp2pp/1p6/8/2P1p3/1N5P/PPR1BPP1/3R2K1 b - -',His rook scoops my queen. Now where are we at?
580,21,28,2Nd5,b'2r2rk1/pb1p2pp/1p6/3n4/2P1p3/1N5P/PPR1BPP1/3R2K1 w - -',I play my knight up. Things are getting tactical now if he takes my knight my rook will take his own rook.
581,21,29,2Rcc1,b'2r2rk1/pb1p2pp/1p6/3n4/2P1p3/1N5P/PP2BPP1/2RR2K1 b - -',He backs up his rook. He has done a lot of backing up in this game. I was really focused in this one and wanted to beat this guy. I was feeling confident and aggressive.
582,21,30,2Nf4,b'2r2rk1/pb1p2pp/1p6/8/2P1pn2/1N5P/PP2BPP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Another tactical shot if his rook takes my pawn on d7 my knight will fork his king and rook while capturing his bishop. I know these are simple maneuvers but I'm more of a positional player and when I can use a tactical device I like to mention it.
583,21,31,2Bf1,b'2r2rk1/pb1p2pp/1p6/8/2P1pn2/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR1BK1 b - -',He has to back up again. I feel like I'm literally pushing him off the board. It feels good. It feels empowering. Perhaps this partly explains the attraction of chess. To have a strategy map it out and execute it and to see it play out before your eyes..............all the while fritz has us about even.
584,21,32,2d5,b'2r2rk1/pb4pp/1p6/3p4/2P1pn2/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR1BK1 w - d6',I push my pawn up challenging him to take it.
585,21,33,2cxd5,b'2r2rk1/pb4pp/1p6/3P4/4pn2/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR1BK1 b - -',He does take it and now we have reached the moment in the game where I for some reason and I can't really explain why throw everything away that I have worked so hard for. It wasn't a complicated position. I moved fast without thinking and played this...
586,21,34,2Nxd5,b'2r2rk1/pb4pp/1p6/3n4/4p3/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR1BK1 w - -',I should have taken the pawn with my bishop my English bishop yet. Chess seems to bring out my flaws. A certain impulsive like impatience. A frustration emerges which in the chess world must be punished. 
587,21,35,2Bc4,b'2r2rk1/pb4pp/1p6/3n4/2B1p3/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',His bishop pins my knight...Desolation...after being in charge the whole game things have turned on a dime and now White is in the driver seat.
588,21,36,2Rfd8,b'2rr2k1/pb4pp/1p6/3n4/2B1p3/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Can't remember what I was thinking other than I was still in a state of shock and anger with myself. A chess game can take on a life of it's own and monopolize your mind.......interestingly enough Fritz indicates that this is the move that buried me so in my dismay in playing the wrong move a few moves earlier I have now made things much worse sometimes it's better to logoff and re-compose yourself after you go wrong in a game.....a chess lesson for me...once again...
589,21,37,2Bxd5+,b'2rr2k1/pb4pp/1p6/3B4/4p3/1N5P/PP3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',My king under attack where have all the good times gone.

My challenge is to conquer myself and my own demons. In both the games I have annotated I made very poor moves after I lost my composure. For me more than anything else chess remains as much a psychological war as anything else...................
 
postscript..............upon reflection and with the passage of time i see now that i never had the clear advantage i thought i had during the game which raises an interesting point...a common error in chess thought is to become so fixated on a move or variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all other thoughts a chess game will never stop speaking to you and can take on a life of it's own with it's accompanying variations....the well is very deep and the roads not taken will be many...........say you know Frasier Crane could have written this."

Here is another annotation in the themed Sicilian Pelikan MT.  Although this is certainly not one of my best games I thought I would annotate it to give you guys a bit of light relief.  Life is about taking the rough with the smooth both on and off the chessboard.  I certainly ended up doing this in this game.  I will begin the commentary with my 7th move as the first 6 moves are forced.

Bg5 - again I play the move which is the most popular and I note from my previous annotation that this is a very strong move because it puts pressure on both f6 and d6 and not to mention a fork on c7 should the Wicked Witch of the West recapture on f6.

I overlooked this move - a rare oversight from yours truly and I was stewing in my own juice for a good week or so.  The reason for this oversight was that I was focussed on the square d4 and I wanted to prevent the black knight from landing on it.  I totally overlooked the fact that Glenda could safely take the rook on a8!  Aaarrgh and treble aaargh!

Thus we can try to develop to control the center and get the white pieces to divert control of it. Candidates are ...Bg7 Rc8...Not too many. Bg7 seems logical actually while Be7 is also OK.

This should lose the game or at least hand over a clear advantage to black. White should go with his goal of development so Be2 Bd3 were all better and also Nc2.

Here is another game in the themed Sicilian Pelikan Bird variation MT started by Matthew (Concordborn).  This time the result goes in my favour.  Although I win a pawn in the middlegame Matthew works it so that we end up with opposite colour bishops and he sets up a Joblock style defensive formation.  However I keep both pairs of rooks on and my extra pawn a passed pawn ties his rooks down to stopping it from getting to Glendadom on a8.  However it was very difficult for me to make headway because Fou Leblanc was also tied to the defense of my a and c pawns.  It looked to be heading for a Low Draw until Matthew walked into a pin and one little pawn push proved decisive.

Reason is to trade then close the position to try favoring my knights. @jkarp: You are correct in that knights are -generally- better than bishops in closed positions. However there is no such rule in chess. When you evaluate the quality of minor pieces the only correct way is by concrete comparison: Which piece is better based on concrete variations.

The knight retake looks on first sight ridiculous since it allows my bishop to take and double the black pawns.

Mrs.Pogonina is a friend of my coach and she is a very strong player. That is correct castling must be made carefully. Here however one can rest assured that it is the best move.

It cannot move up safely because the sacrifice is not exactly sound. Protecting it many times will just lead to my pieces being tied down to it.

However treat material like a positional factor in a position like activity structure better minor pieces etc.. A 2300 player in a game once failed to sacrifice his queen for 2 bishops but large counterplay and stuck to his passive defense and lost quickly. I have won the psychological battle against material overestimation here. Unfortunately my opponent fights his own battle against ""chess fear""."

Another line is 9...Bxf4?! 10.Bxf4 Nxf4 11.Qd2 Ng6 12.Qe3 is good or slightly better for white. @jkarp and others: Please read my annotations. I know that they may be tedious but they will help you get rid of bad thought process. I gave variations here justifying the pawn sacrifice. Yes he can win a ""point""(Pawn is more accurate since counting points in positions doesn't mean much usually) but remember again: MATERIAL IS JUST ANOTHER POSITIONAL IMBALANCE. If you lose a game something in the position must have been bad for you whether it was doubled pawns or something else. The point is that in my variations I get adequete development and activity to offset this imbalance. The point: If you treat material as different and worth more than the other positional considerations then you will always be timid to the strong sacrifices. Material is important but activity is just as important. Instead of tying down my pieces and weakening their activity I strengthen my own pieces and increase the activity all for a pawn. It is a sound sacrifice."

He makes 2 exchanges of his most active pieces and leaves white with a kingside advantage with opposite color bishops and no piece protection for the king. This also frees my dark squared bishop immediately. Ridiculous move but it shows my opponent being afraid of ghosts and ""exchanging to draw"". That leaves another principle: Exchanges do not necessarily clarify the position at all. When you make an exchange you are making a critical decision that may alter the position drastically. Once again please remember that because material is even does not mean the position is close to it. In fact here white has a major advantage worth just as much or even more than a pawn since he will soon have a powerful attack."

But black on the defensive continues passively and does not counterplay. @jkarp: The reason that Bh6 is the best move is because there is no good way to continue the attack because black will simply defend. There is nothing close to mate because black easily defends. If you give white some free moves OF COURSE he will be able to mate. What opponent would allow that? In the start of a chess game if you give the opponent some free moves he will able to capture many of your pieces but you dont allow that.

Applying these into your thought process wioll improve you a lot because these are 3 huge and common mistkaes by even strong players. @jkarp: After looking at your thought process I believe that the way for you to improve is the following: 1.Do not think so much about the principles and general rules in chess as much as the concrete analysis. This is the 3rd most common mistake by club players: They judge the quality of moves by using principles and general rules. Principles are only for selecting candidate ideas and tiebreaks in case you analysed 2 moves and they are equal. Objectivity is the key.  2.Remember the rule: A move no matter how good it looks is only good or bad based on the opponent's answer(s) to it. 3.If you can use these ideas in your though process your performance will soar.

I made my choice on the basis the other knight is very good on d3 and and i can go Nh3+ Kg2 Nf4+! winning the queen! If white tries to prevent that with 25. h3 Qg5+ 26. Kf1 Nxh1 is very good for black. Looks like it's curtains for white.

I could easily have played h6 there and considered it but decided to cover g5 with the knight instead hoping to find a new attack on the king at the same time. i could not see a good way to continue attacking after h6 but it would still left me with a solid position.
881,31,34,3Qg3,b'8/4kp1p/3p4/5q2/4p2P/4P1Qn/PP1P1n1K/R1B5 b - -',Now i can't move either of my knights without one being taken. Nh3+ looks a poor move now.

These doubled pawns are of no trouble to White either as c3 further strengthens the all important d4 pawn and c4 does a good job contesting d5 and can always be traded off if need be.
