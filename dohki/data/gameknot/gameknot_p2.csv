So, since this tournament is a match with two games each, I had to play as black, this time around.  What I'm used to seeing is Carl change his openings.  In fact, I've seen him play the KPO (1.e4), Reti Opening (1.Nf3), and even, the Dunst Opening (1.Nc3).  But, this is the first time that I have seen him play the QPO.  As ION pointed out in my last game with Carl, ""For some people, a fairly fixed opening repertoire is desirable. It leads to them a familiarity with the positions that arise.""  It's safe to say that Carl is one of those peoples because he gets used to things that, for me, can lead to unfamiliar territory.  Sure, the start is what I'm used to, but things change early on.  So, it's more of an, ""educational approach"" as kenneth_fiore_3 puts it.  In fact, that's why he recommended that I play 1.d4 in our first game which became the KID.  And, then, when I played 1.e4 in our second game, he played the Owen's Defense, 1...g6 which I hadn't seen in a while before that and was almost in unfamiliar territory, right then and there.  "

But, I reckon that Carl made the right choice, and if I had this position, 5.Bd2 is also what I would've played.  The reason being is that after 5.a3, I would've blocked the c pawn even further by exchanging with 5...Bxc3  Blocking the c pawn more wouldn't be the reason, but rather, I'd exchange to make Carl double up his pawns along the K side.  That would make it less safe for him to castle short.  But, there'd also be compromises on that side, as I would then start forming a plan to put pressure on his K.  Playing this prevents that."

I posted, but ION posted what I originally said.  As Joann said that sometimes, castling can cause harm, although, Charles said that the mistake was later on.  Then, ION posted and said that it's usually better to castle short.  And, at a later point in time, I showed the thread to TA, and he said that castling early is usually essential.  What he mentioned is that the only time you should consider holding off is when you're much stronger, and we're talking about at IM.  He said, that you generally need to be good enough so that you can sac something like the Q, as he does, and win.  Then, Joe confirmed what Charles said which is that Joann's mistake was later on.

I only do that if I see something that'll appear to give me an edge or win of material.  That was, since Susan Polgar told me that you, especially, don't want to exchange B for N, otherwise.  Well, I would've felt confident, had it led to doubled pawns on the K side.  But, Carl put a stop to that, and with that, I wasn't willing to do it.  I also considered 6...Ba5, similar to the Spanish Opening, after 7.b5 Bb6 8.Na4 would've forced me to exchange.  I also looked at 6...Be7, but I felt that would've left my DSB less mobile.  So, I thought that this was the way to go.  On the other hand, similar to what ION posted in my previous annotation, after handing back a piece, with 6...Be7, my B would be on the same line as the Q, and then you add the N.  So, that might have been better then the move played.  But, since I'm getting into unfamiliar territory, I went by my gut instincts which told me to play this."

So, I studied a bit with GM Susan Polgar in a free course based on how a GM punished the opponent (who was also a GM) for leaving the N on the rim.  He used a discovered attack (masked battery) which led to a fork that won material, when white resigned.  Remembering that, I try a similar strategy against Carl."

Although, that line should fail, but Carl also felt that his next move was forced which, in return, doubles up his pawns.  That's what I wanted because isolated pawns usually benefits your opponent.  It's not always the case, but it can make a big difference during the endgame.  In fact, it could be enough to make or break (win or lose) a game.  And, once he captures, I'll recapture on e5 and see where it goes from there."

I'm now thinking about what would happen after 16.Nxe4 dxe4  The N's left attacked twice, but after retreating, I would be hesitant on whether to exchange with 17...Bxe2 or not.  And, while it's good to think about position, overtime, I've learned that it's better not to overthink.  As that's when you forget about the gut instincts and yoga, go through the fight or flight response which causes you to move way too quickly, and make terrible blunders.  So, I give myself less to think about which, ironically, is the opposite of what Ken told me to do of.  But, it works out for me."

For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White."
