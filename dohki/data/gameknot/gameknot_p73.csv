85,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So white kicks things off with the usual.
86,2,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is the most common response from a GM.  And Solak is no different.
87,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is what you typically see in the Sicilian.  But black's next move is going to be quite unusual and there are no transpositions either.
88,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Normally 2...d6 gets played.  3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6.  Only later on in the late opening does do we see ...Nc3.  So this is quite unusual.  In fact I'd say that this is now out of book.  That doesn't mean that this is weak or that it does not follow the basics but you often don't see it I don't believe that it has a name anymore.  
89,2,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"It's possible that Grischuk wasn't familiar with this line so he decided to play this move as though it were a Ruy Lopez even though it's nothing like that.  I got this idea from ION because in a different annotation he said ""He was intent upon the 1.e4 2.Nf3 3.Bb5 sequence almost regardless of what Black played. Back in schoolboy days I liked the Queen's Gambit openings in which I would play 1.d4 2.c4. 3.Nc3 4.Nf3 5.Bg5. Then I encountered people playing the King's Indian (1...Nf6) and had no idea what to do against it. So I simply played the 5 move sequence I knew. It turned out to be a perfectly playable approach: I won quite a few games playing that!""   But why would a grandmaster do that?  I thought that GM's were familiar with pretty much all of the different variaitons."
90,2,5,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Based on what I mentioned on the last move it's also possible that black thought that he'd play the same thing and play a move as though it were something like a French Defense.  The problem is that you never really know what a GM is thinking.  In the mean time white is about to exchange his B for black's N.  In this position I believe that Grischuk is making the right choice because a N here is more dangerous and worth more then a B.
91,2,6,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"! Since white just exchanged his LSB there's absolutely nothing wrong with this move.  In fact it is developing and quite good.  And I prefer this over 5.d4.  After 5.d4 there would have been exchange 5...cxd4 6.Nxd4.  Normally doubled pawns don't affect a game that much or as cdeburca puts it ""There's more to chess then doubled chess.""  But when you talk about a GM's that's not usually the case.  Double pawns can directly make or break a game because doubled pawns as in this case are two bad pawns which should drastically affect the position later on.  Having said that I think that white made a good and very smart decision to let black keep his doubled pawns as opposed to exchange.  In addition with this move white's DSB is already quite active and doing a lot even though it hasn't moved yet.  Having said all of that I think that white is better developed."
92,2,7,Ne7,b'r1bqkb1r/p2pnppp/2p1p3/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?! So black decides to take an opportunity to catch up on development.  In my opinion this move is quite inaccurate.  Better was 5...Bd6 where his bishop isn't crammed.  Plus he would then be able to play something else without any problems.  The problem here is that this move jams Solak's DSB.  Now he'll have to waste time to get it out so white now has a clear league in development.
93,2,8,h4,b'r1bqkb1r/p2pnppp/2p1p3/2p5/4P2P/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq h3',I don't know why Grischuk played this.  Afterall he's not planning to bring his R out any time soon.  Instead I simply would have continued to develop by bringing the b1 Knight or DSB out.  Or most likely in this position I simply would have castled King side to get my K to safety.
94,2,9,Qc7,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpnppp/2p1p3/2p5/4P2P/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"On the other hand unless there is an extenuating circumstance for doing so I don't know why anyone especially a GM would their Q out before everything else is developed.  Ok I don't always go by every single guideline when it comes to development or General Openings because there are occasions where it's better not to.  But the main thing that I follow is not bringing the Queen before the other pieces are developed.  Now according to the master mater (easy19) sometimes really strong players can get away with deviating from normal openings.  But that's when it's against a lower rated player.  That however is not the case against a GM.  For example in her video of ""Beating Fischer's Record: Victory Over Anand"" Judit Polgar punished Anand for failing to develop properly.  This actually led to his downfall.   With that said I strongly believe that white can now punish black for ignoring this guideline.  It will be very interesting to see what happens from here on in."
95,2,10,h5,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpnppp/2p1p3/2p4P/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But I don't know what white is trying to accomplish here.  Perhaps where looking at a passed pawn which wouldn't happen later on.  If so black can stop this way before it ever happens with ...g6 or ...h6.
96,2,11,e5,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpnppp/2p5/2p1p2P/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now this is a very good developing move but I'd say that white still has an advantage.  That's because he's still slightly more developed and has better control over the center then black.  All he has to do is get the other pieces out which should be easy to do and castle.
97,2,12,Nbd2,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpnppp/2p5/2p1p2P/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! but this is an inaccuracy for the same reason that 5...Ne7 was inaccurate.
98,2,13,f6,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpn1pp/2p2p2/2p1p2P/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',WTH?  Why did black play this?  Better was 8...g7 so then he's be able to get his DSB out immediately.  Instead I view this move as pointless and that there was no need or good reason for this.  This move should cause problems for Solak once he decides to castle.  
99,2,14,Nh4,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpn1pp/2p2p2/2p1p2P/4P2N/3P4/PPPN1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Again I'm not sure why he'd move the same piece more then once when he could have used another piece to develop.  Afterall there were no threats and none of white's pieces were attacked in any way.
100,2,15,g5,b'r1b1kb1r/p1qpn2p/2p2p2/2p1p1pP/4P2N/3P4/PPPN1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq g6',At least however black is punishing white for this one.  Now he just lost tempii and white can now use this time to continue to develop.  Plus it's now feasible for him to get his DSB out.  So far there have been a lot of twists and turns as far as I'm concerned.
101,2,16,d6,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n2p/2pp1p2/2p1p1pP/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Interesting.  I actually like it a lot and since it involves a center it is also a developing move.
102,2,17,1Nf1,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n2p/2pp1p2/2p1p1pP/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/R1BQKN1R b KQkq -',?! At first I wasn't sure why Grischuk moved here.  But what he will play next answers my question as he'll find a good place to put his N.  However I view this as a waste of time since he could have found a better place in one as opposed to three moves.  How?  Simple all he had to play was 11.Nd4.
103,2,18,1h6,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp1p1p/2p1p1pP/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/R1BQKN1R w KQkq -',But I don't know why this was played.
104,2,19,1Ne3,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp1p1p/2p1p1pP/4P3/3PNN2/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',At least as noted earlier white found a good place for his N and now has a strong Knight pair which is quite unusual.  Normally you see a good bishop pair but not a Knight pair like this.
105,2,20,1f5,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp3p/2p1pppP/4P3/3PNN2/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Right now black intends and will soon exchange but white will not allow that right away.
106,2,21,1g4,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp3p/2p1pppP/4P1P1/3PNN2/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq g3',Instead he plays this first for whatever reason.  He could have just taken and you'd still wind up with an even exchange.  But I guess this move gives more coverage and then has an equal amount of material as your opponent because I remember Jack Stockel advising me to count your number of pieces and this is what he generally alludes to.  So there has to be some mathematic logic to this that I don't quite understand.
107,2,22,1fxg4,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp3p/2p1p1pP/4P1p1/3PNN2/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',However black decides to take.
108,2,23,1Nh2,b'r1b1kb1r/p1q1n3/2pp3p/2p1p1pP/4P1p1/3PN3/PPP2P1N/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"But Grischuk can't take back right away as it would lose.  So in other words if instead 14.Nxg4?? 14...Bxg4 which not only loses a piece for a pawn but creates a very nasty pin for white in the aftermath.  So instead white is going to wait for be patient and wait for the opportunity to arrive.  I like his decision as I know that chess requires a lot of patience and thinking.  In fact I remember about when I resorted to ""Unsound Agression"".  But although I disagreed a lot of those commentators were right especially in a very real sense.  That's because with unsound aggression you're just being very impatient and getting aggressive early.  But much later on I looked at one watched a segment of the Alkehine Tournament with commentary from GM Judit Polgar.  In it she stressed just how important it is to be patient.  Well as the saying goes ""patience is of a virtue."""
109,2,24,1Bg7,b'r1b1k2r/p1q1n1b1/2pp3p/2p1p1pP/4P1p1/3PN3/PPP2P1N/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So black now uses his opportunity to develop another piece as noted earlier with this fianchetto.  And now it appears that black is ahead in development but anything can change.  Actually as you recall on the last move I noted that white would wait and be patient before taking.  Guess what?  That's about to happen.  It's because in this position it's now feasible for white to get a pawn back without losing anything.  And he's about to do this with 15.Nexg4.
110,2,25,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/p1q1n1b1/2pp3p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3P4/PPP2P1N/R1BQK2R w KQ -',"In the meantime black decides to use his opportunity to castle.  I think that it's smart.  Not only does it tuck the monarch away but it's another developing move and generally brings you one step closer to competing development.  How do I know this?  Well in her video against Anand Judit Polgar explained a moral and one thing which you learn from that video is that it's a good idea to ""complete development by castling"" as she puts it."
111,2,26,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/p1q1n1b1/2pp3p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPP2P1N/R2QK2R b KQ -',At least white decides to develop another piece.
112,2,27,1Be6,b'r4rk1/p1q1n1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPP2P1N/R2QK2R w KQ -',But black's development is now complete.
113,2,28,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/p1q1n1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPPQ1P1N/R3K2R b KQ -',And that's almost true for white.  The question is which side will Grischuk castle?  We will find out soon.
114,2,29,1Kh8,b'r4r1k/p1q1n1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPPQ1P1N/R3K2R w KQ -',I don't know why Solak played this.
115,2,30,1O-O-O,b'r4r1k/p1q1n1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPPQ1P1N/2KR3R b - -',But with this move we can now say that white has also just completed his development.
116,2,31,1Ng8,b'r4rnk/p1q3b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/4P1N1/3PB3/PPPQ1P1N/2KR3R w - -',Ok I'm not sure what's running through black's mind here.
117,2,32,1c4,b'r4rnk/p1q3b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/2P1P1N1/3PB3/PP1Q1P1N/2KR3R b - c3',But white decides to do something before black can figure out a way to correct his doubled pawns.
118,2,33,1Qe7,b'r4rnk/p3q1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/2P1P1N1/3PB3/PP1Q1P1N/2KR3R w - -',And for whatever reason black decides to put pressure on the e file.  This time that plan is not going work because white's pieces are just as coordinated as black's.
119,2,34,2Qe2,b'r4rnk/p3q1b1/2ppb2p/2p1p1pP/2P1P1N1/3PB3/PP2QP1N/2KR3R b - -',And this is how white foils black's plan.
120,2,35,2d5,b'r4rnk/p3q1b1/2p1b2p/2ppp1pP/2P1P1N1/3PB3/PP2QP1N/2KR3R w - -',In this position black wants to exchange pawns with white.
121,2,36,2Bd2,b'r4rnk/p3q1b1/2p1b2p/2ppp1pP/2P1P1N1/3P4/PP1BQP1N/2KR3R b - -',I don't know why Grischuk played this instead of just taking right away.  But now the exchange is about to ensue.
122,2,37,Qf7,b'r4rnk/p4qb1/2p1b2p/2p1p1pP/2P1P1N1/8/PP1BQP1N/2KR3R w - -',?!  At this point black wants to force another exchange.  In my mind however this is just a waste of time because material is even and how will exchanging benefit anyone's position?
123,2,38,2Bc3,b'r4rnk/p4qb1/2p1b2p/2p1p1pP/2P1P1N1/2B5/PP2QP1N/2KR3R b - -',But I like white's intention.  The idea is to try and win a pawn.  Of course however there are ways to stop this with something like 23...Qf4+.  Instead however Solak is about to win a pawn by attacking white's Q.
124,2,39,Rae8,b'4rrnk/p4qb1/2p4p/2p1p1pP/2b1P1N1/2B1Q3/PP3P1N/2KR3R w - -',"So black ""throws in the towel"" by putting pressure on the e file.  This time however I like the way Solak does it."

126,2,41,2Bb5,b'4rrnk/p4qb1/2p4p/1bp1p1pP/4P1N1/1PB1Q3/P4P1N/2KR3R w - -',Of course black easily gets out of it.
127,2,42,2Rd6,b'4rrnk/p4qb1/2pR3p/1bp1p1pP/4P1N1/1PB1Q3/P4P1N/2K4R b - -',? Therefore white takes advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on the sixth rank.  Unfortunately this is a mistake as black is going to win another free pawn after 26...Qxh5.
128,2,43,2Rg1,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR3p/1bp1p1pq/4P1N1/1PB1Q3/P4P1N/2K3R1 b - -',I do not know why white played this.

130,2,45,Qf4+,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR3p/1bQ1p1p1/4PqN1/1PB5/P4P1N/2K3R1 w - -',Now black renders in another check.
131,2,46,2Kb2,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR3p/1bQ1p1p1/4PqN1/1PB5/PK3P1N/6R1 b - -',"?? And white gets out of it.  However I think that better was 29.Bd2.  I generally like to get out of check by attacking something if possible because it makes me less nervous and sometimes prevents me from getting nervous in the first place.  By doing things this way it would produce a ""Fight or Flight"" syndrome for me.  "
132,2,47,2h5,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR4/1bQ1p1pp/4PqN1/1PB5/PK3P1N/6R1 w - -',So Solak goes for it by attacking white's N.
133,2,48,3Rh1,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR4/1bQ1p1pp/4PqN1/1PB5/PK3P1N/7R b - -',?? This is a blunder.  Now black should win a piece with 20...hxg4.  Lucky for white however black misses this opportunity and takes white's pawn instead with 30...Qxe4.
134,2,49,3f3,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR4/1bQ1p1pp/4q1N1/1PB2P2/PK5N/7R b - -',?! So white now decides to attack's black's Q.  But this time it's pointless as Solak can just retreat.
135,2,50,3Qf4,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2pR4/1bQ1p1pp/5qN1/1PB2P2/PK5N/7R w - -',I don't know what black is trying to accomplish here.

138,2,53,3Rg6,b'4rrnk/p5b1/2p3R1/2Q1p1pp/P4qN1/1PB2P2/1K2b2N/7R b - -',Now white decides to put pressure on the g file and in a very interesting way.
139,2,54,3Nf6,b'4rr1k/p5b1/2p2nR1/2Q1p1pp/P4qN1/1PB2P2/1K2b2N/7R w - -',But black decides to get even by attacking white's N.  Unfortunately this is not going to work because white is now going to get a pawn back after 34.Nxe5.
140,2,55,Kh7,b'4rr2/p5bk/2p2nR1/2Q1N1pp/P4q2/1PB2P2/1K2b2N/7R w - -',I don't know why black played this.  Afterall Solak is not going to win whites R here because of Grischuk's e5 N.
141,2,56,3Nhg4,b'4rr2/p5bk/2p2nR1/2Q1N1pp/P4qN1/1PB2P2/1K2b3/7R b - -',Very interesting.  At this point white now decides to threaten mate in an unusual way as we will see later on.
142,2,57,3Bxf3,b'4rr2/p5bk/2p2nR1/2Q1N1pp/P4qN1/1PB2b2/1K6/7R w - -',?? So black decides to take.  Unfortunately this is Solak's losing blunder because of what's about to unfold.  
143,2,58,3Rxg7+,b'4rr2/p5Rk/2p2n2/2Q1N1pp/P4qN1/1PB2b2/1K6/7R b - -',So white takes and mate is inevitable from here on in.  In fact this time it's safe to say that mate is soon to follow because it's almost clear on how this will happen.
144,2,59,3Kxg7,b'4rr2/p5k1/2p2n2/2Q1N1pp/P4qN1/1PB2b2/1K6/7R w - -',Black takes.  Another option which was slightly better would have been 36...Kh8 as it avoids but then comes the immediate family fork 37.Ng6+ winning white's Q.  Well Solak does not want to chance so he takes back what he doesn't realize is this move will lead to his downfall even sooner.
145,2,60,3Qxa7+,b'4rr2/Q5k1/2p2n2/4N1pp/P4qN1/1PB2b2/1K6/7R b - -',And that's because of this move.  Now in this position black's only options are 37...Ng8 or 37...Nh8.  Both of which lead to an unusal mating net in two.  Black sees this and therefore resigns.  One moral to this story is that you have to be careful where you place your pieces.  Had Solak taken advantage of white's mistake of 30.Rh1?? with 30...hxg4 he would probably would have won.  And this unusual mating net would not have been feasible.

When I had made a challenge my German national Zugspitze appeared challenging me with me opening as white.  I tried to gracefully decline but the machine in Gameknot would not allow me to decline.  I figured it was a sort of computer thing and then I though oh well why not play another game when I had told GK I was through playing games with online chess players.  It was a moment I knew I was sealing my fate to play another game despite my limitations to GK saying no more online games but then GK allowed Zugspitze to come into my chess board and there was no way to get rid of him! 

I usually open e4 so this is no surprise.  "

I use the Caro Kann most times selecting from two other defenses I trust: Alekhine's and Sicilian (usually in Sicilian I opt for the Shev or the Dragon).  Imagine my immediate sparkle to Zugspitze (Black) to use my favorite defense against my e4 open!  I had to check this out! And play! 
234,6,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The first time I ever encountered the Caro was when I was playing against a blind seminarian (we were both seminarians having a hobby outside of Greek and Hebrew and Theology and Philosophy and Exegesis and Church History and Homiletics and Reformed Theology and Psychology and Sacred History and Secular History and all we had to do to get ordination.  We just got together and played chess and relaxed in Graduate School instead of going out to party.  We liked being unavailable to distractions sort of like monks in a monastery and we liked chess! This is the move I made in 1983 the first time I saw c6 to my open e4.  It was a reaction to take over the center of the board as fast as possible and it seemed the best move to make.  It turned out I had made the standard response to Caro Kann.  
235,6,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',My blind friend in seminary did the same move which is standard for the Caro Kann.  At this point I can't recall what I did in 1983 with the Blind Seminarian but soon after I had played with him I studied the Caro Kann.  I liked Sicilian and Alekhine's. I had decided for my brains to give up the Ruy Lopez since my father beat it every time with the King's Gambit.  I learned the King's Gambit from him and my records here on GK show I use it ALL the time against the insignificant Ruy Lopez. I had also studied the French Defense enough to see it was mostly a blockade like in Les Miserables by Victor Hugo when his book was written about something entirely different from chess.  I had read Rommel's book on being a Platoon Leader in WWI against the French and the French like blockades and retreating instead of fighting.  The French Foreign Legion is a gathering of exceptional troops and these troops of the French Foreign Legion are not included. However in chess the French Defense is as it was in WWI against Rommel defeated and running behind barricades.

I am not a genius but maybe Zugspitze is about the Caro.  The Caro is always able to respond with clarity for the next moves.

I could have moved f2 but my king is the only one protecting c3.  I do with my bishop what a bishop always does for the king.  Be his messenger and be ready to support him.  The king wants to protect the c3 pawn for the obvious reason and the bishop without asking why comes to the king to do what he is skilled to do along diagonal lines.

I don't have my infantry to attack at this point.  Neither does black so it is going to be a lock up in INFANTRY while the remaining PIECES take over.

It does seem like advancing a pawn on the Queenside isn't the best idea when your Kingside is heavily under attack... But in the given ""best"" line Black swaps his only developed minor piece!

Bd3 is also a plan. all in all black has just a few threats possibly not enough to equalise and he needs some sort of cooperation to make it happen. white on the other hand has played superficial the last couple of moves and is still unaware of the fact that he has to be precise in defence for a while before claiming the win.

The team is YeshuaÂ´s Army one of Gameknot six Christian teams. Anyway I started with 1. d4 I like to play the Queens Gambit pretty much nowadays. My opponent answered with d5.

528,16,7,Qxc5,b'1r3rk1/1p2nppp/p4n2/2qp4/8/1P2PB2/PB3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',After this last exchange I have the bishop pair and my opponent two knights. According to the chess theory itÂ´s a small advantage!
529,16,8,1Bxf6,b'1r3rk1/1p2nppp/p4B2/2qp4/8/1P2PB2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Suddenly I saw that i could exchange my dark squared bishop for one of my opponents knights! Furtrhermore that knight was not protected by any piece only by a pawn. That means that after my opponent has striked back with his g-pawn it will appear a hole in the pawn shield in the front of his king! To demolish the pawn shield in front of the enemy king is as far as i know a greater advantage than the bishop pair. So I gave the bishop pair up because of this new greater advantage. So must you think in chess.
530,16,9,f5,b'1r3rk1/1p2np1p/p7/2qp1p2/8/1P1QPB2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',17...f5 was a good move it somehow defends the Black King from threats alongside the diagonal b1-h7!
531,16,10,2Qe2,b'1r4k1/3rnp1p/p2q4/1p1p1p2/8/1P2PB2/P1R1QPPP/3R2K1 b - -',Trying to replace my pieces in optimal positions. I want to triple on the d-file with Queen and two Rooks. Furthermore my light-squared bishop is also aiming against Blacks d5-pawn. that means that Black will be tied up with the defense of that pawn.
532,16,11,2Qd1,b'3r4/4npkp/p2r4/1p1pqp2/8/1P1RPB2/P2R1PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',Finally I have reached my desired position. But this is not enough because Black can defend properly. Now itÂ´s time for me to create a new weakness according to the theory of the two weaknesses well known in the chess theory!
533,16,12,2f6,b'3r4/4n1kp/p2r1p2/1p1pqp2/8/1P1RPB2/P2R1PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',Blacks position is rather passive.
534,16,13,3Qf3,b'3r4/4n3/p2r1pkp/1p1pqp2/3R4/1P2PQP1/P2R1PBP/6K1 b - -',Now IÂ´m also aiming against Blacks f5-pawn. The theory of the two weaknesses!
535,16,14,3e4,b'3r4/4n3/p2r1pkp/1p1pqp2/3RP3/1P4P1/P2R1PBP/3Q2K1 b - -',Maybe not the most innovative move in the position but I couldnÂ´t find any stronger!
536,16,15,3f4,b'3r4/4n3/p2r2kp/1p1pqp2/3RBP2/1P4P1/P2R3P/3Q2K1 b - f3',Gaining a tempo with threat against Blacks Queen. Is also fixing Blacks f5-pawn.
537,16,16,3Bg2,b'3r4/4n3/p2rq1kp/1p1p1p2/3R1P2/1P4P1/P2R2BP/3Q2K1 b - -',Material it is even but maybe I have got a small positional advantage here? But itÂ´s not easy to know how to best proceed from here!
538,16,17,3h5,b'3r4/4n3/p2rq1k1/1p1p1p1p/3R1P2/1P4P1/P2R2BP/3Q2K1 w - -',? Not a good move creates another pawn weakness for Black!
539,16,18,3Bf3,b'3r4/4nq2/p2r2k1/1p1p1p1p/3R1P2/1P3BP1/P3R2P/3Q2K1 b - -',Starting to pressure along the d1-h5 diagonal. 
540,16,19,4a4,b'3r4/4nq2/p2r3k/1p1p1p1p/P2R1P2/1P3BP1/4R2P/3Q2K1 b - a3',The game seems a little bit locked on the kings-side so therefore I will try to provoke a new pawn weakness for Black on the queens-side!
541,16,20,a5,b'3r4/5q2/2nr3k/p2p1p1p/Pp3P2/1P2RBP1/3R3P/3Q2K1 w - -',The game bears the stamp of slow manuevering in this stage.
542,16,21,4Bxh5,b'3r4/4nq2/3r3k/p2p1p1B/Pp3P2/1P2R1P1/3R1K1P/3Q4 b - -',Maybe the breakthrough at last? I wins a pawn thanks to this tactics!
543,16,22,4Re5,b'3r4/4n3/3r1q1k/p3Rp2/Pp1p1P2/1P4P1/3RBK1P/3Q4 b - -',IÂ´m aiming at both Blacks a- and f-pawns forcing Black to passively defend. 
544,16,23,4Rc5,b'3r4/8/2nr1q1k/p1R2p2/Pp1p1P2/1P4P1/3RBK1P/3Q4 b - -',Better was b5.
545,16,24,4d3,b'3r4/8/2nr1q1k/p1R2p2/Pp3P2/1P1p2P1/3RBK1P/3Q4 w - -',A great tactics by Black here if I escape with my bishop here Black will give a check on d4 in the next move and then win my undefended Rook on c5 for free!
546,16,25,4Rxc6,b'3r4/8/2Rr1q1k/p4p2/Pp3P2/1P1p2P1/3RBK1P/3Q4 b - -',I found that this little sacrifice was the only solution! Better than lose a whole Rook anyway!
547,16,26,4Bf3,b'3r4/8/2r2q1k/p4p2/Pp3P2/1P1p1BP1/3R1K1P/3Q4 b - -',Now am I quality under. 
548,16,27,Rc3,b'3r4/8/7k/p4p2/Pp1q1P2/1Prp1BP1/3R2KP/3Q4 w - -',Now it doesnÂ´t looks so fine out for me! I have got a very passive crampy game and is also a quality under!
549,16,28,5g4,b'8/8/3r3k/p4p2/Pp1q1PP1/1Prp1B2/3R2KP/4Q3 b - -',A  pawn move that opens up the diagonal e1-h4 for a counterattack with my Queen.
550,16,29,5fxg4,b'8/8/3r3k/p7/Pp1q1Pp1/1Prp1B2/3R2KP/4Q3 w - -',Better was to escape with the King to a safer square!
551,16,30,5Qh4+,b'8/8/3r3k/p7/Pp1q1PpQ/1Prp1B2/3R2KP/8 b - -',Now I get a pretty nasty check!
552,16,31,Rf6,b'8/4Q3/5r1k/p7/Pp1qBPp1/1Prp4/3R2KP/8 w - -',He totally missed the checkmate in the next move with Qh7#.
553,16,32,5Qh7#,b'8/7Q/5r1k/p7/Pp1qBPp1/1Prp4/3R2KP/8 b - -',Checkmate! This was a really hard game between two Christian team players. Have tolerance with me if my comments not is of a very high standard but I have tried to give my opinions about the game after my best ability!
554,17,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',starting out with the English opening. I start out the game finding myself in a position I disliked because of some bad play in the opening however as the middle game approaches I decide the time is ripe to sacrifice a pawn and suddenly all my pieces find themselves with beautiful squares/diagonals and I get to take control of the game as my opponent finds no real lines of attack.
555,17,1,Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',I felt this to be a nice flexible move since I figured I'd likely be planning to put pressure along the c-file and I also figured black would probably want to fianchetto the LSB. Plus I wasn't 100% sure where I wanted to develop my Queen knight
556,17,2,cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p2pn2/3P4/3P4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Now relieving the tension only once black has opened up a new diagonal for his LSB
557,17,3,a3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p3n2/3p4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',planning to follow up with b4 to hopefully clamp down on blacks intended c5 break. However in light of blacks response this may prove to be a pipe dream
558,17,4,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1p3n2/2pp4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - c6',good move getting in the break/expansion before I can put a stop to it.
559,17,5,1b3,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/5n2/2pp4/8/PP3NP1/2Q1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',hoping to give my DSB a good diagonal and to control the squares in front of blacks hanging pawns
560,17,6,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/p2nbppp/1q3n2/2pp4/8/PP3NP1/2Q1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',placing immediate pressure against my now tender b pawn
561,17,7,1e3,b'r1b2rk1/p2nbppp/1q3n2/2pp4/8/PP2PNP1/2Q2PBP/RNB2RK1 b - -',?! again I was trying to control the squares in front of the black pawns structure however I should have kept the pawn on it's original starting square so it can play e2-e4 in a single move. as is the move is just a waste of time better would have been Nbd2
562,17,8,a5,b'1rb2rk1/3nbppp/1q3n2/p1pp4/8/PP2PNP1/2QN1PBP/R1B2RK1 w - a6',hoping to undermine my pawn structure 
563,17,9,1Re1,b'1r3rk1/1b1nbppp/1q3n2/p1pp4/8/PP2PNP1/2QN1PBP/1RB1R1K1 b - -',Realising my position is on a downward slope I prepare to make a bid for active play. I think it's an important quality to realise sometimes that your position will only lead to trouble if you sit around doing nothing and so at times like these it does one well to think of ways to suddenly change the nature of the position.
564,17,10,1e4,b'1r2r1k1/1b1nbppp/1q3n2/p1pp4/4P3/PP3NP1/2QN1PBP/1RB1R1K1 b - -',! Right in the nick of time. I realise that I need to lash out and this is an excellent way to do that. now my main intention is to undermine blacks control over the centre and take away blacks dynamic potential. The other very important point is that I open up the c4 square for use of my pieces and weaken the black pawn structure I also give my DSB the chance to develop to f4 and open up the d file for use of my pieces. After this very strong sacrifice I think white really takes over the flow of the game and now it's white who holds all the positional trumps in the position.
565,17,11,1Nd2,b'1r2r1k1/1b1nbppp/1q6/p1p5/4p3/PP4P1/2QN1PBP/1RB1R1K1 b - -',looking to make it's way to c4 where it will attack the black queen and have a lot of hold over the centre and game.
566,17,12,1f5,b'1r2r1k1/1b1nb1pp/1q6/p1p2p2/4p3/PP4P1/2QN1PBP/1RB1R1K1 w - f6',after whites sacrifice of the e pawn it suddenly becomes difficult for black to come up with strong game plans. here he tries to get something going on the kingside
567,17,13,2Bf4,b'1r2r1k1/1b1nb1pp/4q3/p1p2p2/2N1pB2/PP4P1/2Q2PBP/1R2R1K1 b - -',notice how much better whites minor pieces are compared to blacks the only bad white minor piece is the LSB but then the LSB can redirect to c4 and become quite strong due to the weakened c4-g1 diagonal
568,17,14,2Bf1,b'r3r1k1/3nb1pp/2b1q3/p1p2p2/4pB2/PP2N1P1/2Q2P1P/1R1R1BK1 b - -',threatening Bc4 white really has a strangle hold over the initiative here
569,17,15,Qg6,b'r3r2k/3nb1pp/2b3q1/p1p2p2/2B1pB2/PP2N1P1/2Q2P1P/1R1R2K1 w - -',despite being down a pawn whites much more active and coordinated army give white a decent advantage in my view
570,17,16,2Bd5,b'r3r2k/3nb1pp/2b3q1/p1pB1p2/4pB2/PP2N1P1/2Q2P1P/1R1R2K1 b - -',trying to trade so I can start attacking blacks weak pawns
571,17,17,3Qb5,b'5r1k/2r1b1pp/8/qQpR1p2/P3p3/P3B1P1/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',since a draw is the same as a win and since the endgames are much better for white I offer a queen trade
572,17,18,3Ra7,b'5r1k/r3b1pp/8/qQpR1p2/P3p3/P3B1P1/5P1P/3R2K1 w - -',trading on whites terms would undouble the pawns
573,17,19,4Ra1,b'5k2/6pp/8/8/r3p3/P5P1/5P1P/R5K1 b - -',I offer a draw now because I only needed a draw and because at the time this payed out I felt a little burnt out and didn't feel like trying to convert a long endgame. However ordinarily white would have no reason to fear a loss and so playing the ending out should be the default for white since the only possible results are a draw or win for white. the best try for a win is probably to bring the king to the queenside get in h4 if allowed and try to use tempo moves to get blacks rook to make an unfavourable move.
574,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So here is a game against hughlews where i play rather bad at the beginning but manage to mate my opponent at the with an overwhelming attack. Enjoy.
575,18,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My usual response to e4
576,18,2,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',this was a rather surprising move indeed considering the mate can be defended easily and then maybe the queen coming out early could be punished.
577,18,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',decided to develop my knight while at the same time defending against a mate but also my knight is pinned now.

586,18,12,1Qf4,b'rq3rk1/1b2Bpbp/3p2p1/p2P4/2p2Q2/7P/PPP2PP1/2KR2NR b - -',Here white probably could have taken the rook. Not sure why he didn't.

Anand conferma la scelta per lâapertura di Re Carlsen si affida di nuovo alla berlinese ed il Campione del Mondo gioca 4.d3. I due giocatori seguono la Anand-Aronian del Memorial Alekhine 2013 finchÃ© Anand gioca la novitÃ  10.Ag5. Carlsen riflette per 20â e risponde con 10..Ae6. I motori si âeccitanoâ (e con loro gli spettatori) e danno +060 al bianco (con 11.Axe3 seguita da d4). Anand dopo 10â preferisce la ânormaleâ Cbd2. La partita prosegue senza particolari emozioni ed entra in un finale di pezzi pesanti valutato da praticamente tutti gli autorevoli commentatori di questo Match sostanzialmente pari ma â¦ Carlsen proponendo ad Anand grattacapi sempre piÃ¹ complessi (ed in questo il Numero uno al Mondo ha un talento fantastico!) con una delle sue âmagieâ riesce a vincere portandosi avanti nel match con un doRiguardo il finale oggi abbiamo deciso di far parlare (tramite i loro tweet pubblicati nel corso della partita) solo GM con la âserieâ anche i Grandi Maestri si chiedono: perchÃ©?
Jonathan Rowson subito dopo la decisione di Anand di cedere il primo pedone con 38.Dg3: âCan anybody explain why Vishy blundered a pawn?â
Hikaru Nakamura: âCan someone tell me why Anand eschewed 51.b3 which led to a theoretical draw?â (Questa la breve linea che secondo Nakamura conduce alla patta teorica: 51.b3 Te3+ 52.Rh2 Txc3 53.bxc4)
Per concludere e per la serie âi GM rispondonoâ segnaliamo invece questâaltro âtweetâ sempre di Nakamura: âI know people say 60.b4 was a draw but I am not sure anyone would have found it in that situation.â So che le persone dicono che 60.b4 era patta. Ma non sono sicuro che chiunque lâavrebbe trovata in questa situazione.

835,22,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I opened the GK database just in case; I didn't know how this opening can be played well because this sequence often ruins beginners right here. It turned out this is the main line anyhow.
836,22,3,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The best move. All other moves are blunders or hard to maintain the knight with.
837,22,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"Also common for my ""vs. beginners"" line. That and why not begin supporting a pawn with a pawn?"
838,22,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Prevents 4. e6! (as annotated in the last game). White could exchange here but I don't see why either color would opt for exchanging at this moment. The center is still being contested.
839,22,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So instead I support both pawns. I'm not afraid of an eventual Bb4+ and I felt I could respond to the other bishop if it came out.
840,22,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And here you have it. Here was where I realized the close similarities in our matches. Since it involved the Sicilian the game where I was Black turned out to be very different (both c pawns were gone by this point) but I never stopped to think about it until I crossed this game long lost in my own databases. This game has a clear influence on our match right up until this point.
841,22,8,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/3nP3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Because the c pawns are still in play my pawn can harass the knight as seen here.
842,22,9,Nb6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not worried about c5 (Nd7 is a good square for the knight in spite of the bishop block) and likely better than the unsupported Nb4.
843,22,10,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnpP3/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And notice now how important the c pawn becomes in this match. Black wants to play 6... Bxe6 but if so then White eagerly responds with 7. d5! and so the only other option becomes...
844,22,11,fxe6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/1nnpp3/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black normally likes to castle short from what I gathered in my quick glance at this opening. Now that has become a lot more dangerous and the kingside must be remedied or lost.
845,22,12,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/1nnpp3/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I develop more and activate the queenside a bit.
846,22,13,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1p2p/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Obviously planning a fianchetto. Black clearly wants to castle quickly.
847,22,14,h4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1p2p/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP3P/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq h3',So here I decide to aim for O-O-O and respond with a kingside pawn storm. If my plan continues Black's King is going to have some serious issues very shortly...
848,22,15,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP3P/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So their plan continues...
849,22,16,h5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',As does mine. Now I'm sure something else could have been played but Black clearly realizes now the danger of what their plan may hold. Even so as for this next move...
850,22,17,Kf7,b'r1bq3r/ppp1pkbp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',It doesn't take too much thought to see why this could be viewed as terribly dangerous. Even with the goal of exchange in my mind surely Black has better options...!
851,22,18,1Ng5+,b'r1bq3r/ppp1pkbp/1nnpp1p1/6NP/2PP4/2N5/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',Demonstrating now why the king's castling rights shouldn't have been spent to g6. Now h7 is under attack as well.
852,22,19,1Ke8,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/6NP/2PP4/2N5/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',Now Black has moved the king for nothing.
853,22,20,1Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/6NP/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Planning an all out assault on the kingside and O-O-O looks even stronger for White now.
854,22,21,1Kd7,b'r1bq3r/pppkp1bp/1nnpp1p1/6NP/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Very crowded for the king but it needs to hide away from the opposite side of the board at this point. Effectively now the Kingside becomes an epic battleground where no king should wander...
855,22,22,1Nf7,b'r1bq3r/pppkpNbp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This was my most clear mistake in the match I think. Yes I have the rook for a knight now but...
856,22,23,1Qf8,b'r1b2q1r/pppkpNbp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',...I didn't realize the dual purpose of Black's king hiding away at this point. It was to strengthen the back rank via the queen. Now I must exchange right here and now and be extremely cautious and aware of f2's defenses....
857,22,24,1Nxh8,b'r1b2q1N/pppkp1bp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Forced as noted.
858,22,25,1Bxh8,b'r1b2q1b/pppkp2p/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',The position is not hopeless for Black as I once thought here! I told myself that with the rook gone I could continue blasting away at the Kingside...
859,22,26,1hxg6,b'r1b2q1b/pppkp2p/1nnpp1P1/8/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',...as you see here....
860,22,27,1Bxd4,b'r1b2q2/pppkp2p/1nnpp1P1/8/2Pb4/2NB4/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',But now I realize how vulnerable my defenses really were. f2 is under major heavy fire...!!!
861,22,28,1Qe2,b'r1b2q2/pppkp2p/1nnpp1P1/8/2Pb4/2NB4/PP2QPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',And here was where I held my breath. IF I played Rf1 then I abandon my control of the Kingside. The black bishop blocks Nd4 but Nb4 is almost as strong. If I lose that LSB my kingside goes unstable but then I must play Bb1 and all hopes of near-future castling are gone.
862,22,29,1hxg6,b'r1b2q2/pppkp3/1nnpp1p1/8/2Pb4/2NB4/PP2QPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Thankfully they didn't see it! But my issues are far from over and I take another hard moment to think.
863,22,30,1Be3,b'r1b2q2/pppkp3/1nnpp1p1/8/2Pb4/2NBB3/PP2QPP1/R3K2R b KQ -',As far as playable options are concerned I felt this move gave me the most relief in what I could play. Now if Nb4...
864,22,31,1Qf6,b'r1b5/pppkp3/1nnppqp1/8/2Pb4/2NBB3/PP2QPP1/R3K2R w KQ -',And there you have it. I can no longer castle or I risk unraveling my defenses after Bxc3.
865,22,32,1Rc1,b'r1b5/pppkp3/1nnppqp1/8/2Pb4/2NBB3/PP2QPP1/2R1K2R b K -',So now my final developing piece must play a defending role. Luckily my king is still safe for now and I have a certain plan in mind involving keeping my rooks active in both roles...
866,22,33,1e5,b'r1b5/pppkp3/1nnp1qp1/4p3/2Pb4/2NBB3/PP2QPP1/2R1K2R w K -',d4 is now under undisputed Black control. I'm not terribly worried yet though.
867,22,34,1Rh6,b'r1b5/pppkp3/1nnp1qpR/4p3/2Pb4/2NBB3/PP2QPP1/2R1K3 b - -',This move now completes the kingside flank I tried so hard to maintain. Things are starting to look good and playable for me again and the queen must hide to a less favorable square- and yet Black immediately resigns here! The position is equal in material and I don't see how I have a totally secured tempo over Black even after some checks. What do you think reader? Was Black's game utterly hopeless here? And why did the existence of both c pawns in this game matter so much? Thanks for your time to look over this match in the meantime! :)
868,23,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"Al termine della quarta partita Caruana aveva previsto un risultato decisivo a breve e oggi Carlsen ha risolto il dubbio su chi sarebbe stato lâautore del primo âscoreâ! Contrariamente a quanto temeva il GM Gormally Magnus cambia apertura (1.c4) e costruisce in poche mosse una posizione che avrebbe presentato gli arrocchi eterogenei (a dire del norvegese con buone prospettive per il bianco) ma Anand invita (13..Ac7) Carlsen ad entrare in un (quasi) finale leggermente favorevole al prezzo di una prima semplificazione (cambio delle donne).  E Carlsen accetta!  Non ancora soddisfatto Anand âprovocaâ di nuovo (18..Ab6) il norvegese prospettandogli la possibilitÃ  di semplificare ulteriormente la posizione ed entrare in un finale con quattro torri e lâAlfiere del bianco palesemente (ma non decisamente) preferibile a quello del nero. Il Numero Uno al Mondo accetta di nuovo entrando in quello che unanimemente viene considerato il campo in cui eccelle piÃ¹ di ogni altro: saper sfruttare i piccoli vantaggi nei finali. Alla fine Anand dopo 58 mosse paga a caro prezzo le sue âprovocazioniâ ed Ã¨ costretto allâabbandono dopo non essere stato in grado di difendere un finale difficile ma che sembrava sostenibile. La prima vittoria nel match ha subito provocato molte reazioni. Questo ci sembra il âtweetâ decisamente piÃ¹ meritevole di essere citato:  Tarrasch said âbefore the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame.â Sadly for Anand in the endgame the gods have placed Carlsen!

This can have a good idea behind: moving the king to the other side where I am more or less absent maybe he can pass the storm. But better players than me will find funny I hope to check the lines. White has two escape routes winning: BxNf6 QxNf6 and of course he can throw in Qxe6 first. But even this wonderful Qxe6 was enough to save and probably win the game despite the piece less I wasn't satisfied.

After going through a Big Slump and losing my previous game to Klaus to a pin motif I was really chuffed to get this result!  Yet again I had Operation Joblock to thank here.  There was a lot of play down the middle and it resulted in a mid-game queen trade.  I think both players found it very hard to figure out how to make progress from such attrition.  Klaus did leave a pawn for me to pick off but I knew it was toxic because if Fou Leblanc had snapped it off he would have been trapped on the queenside.  There was no way I was gonna allow this so I took great steps to make sure that Klaus could make no in-roads into my position.  Once I was convinced that I had shut him out I offered him a draw and he kindly accepted it.  So how did this all happen?  Well here is the thematic Dutch Defense.  We kick off with 1. d4 and then f5."

I did not want to take it on the previous move because I was worried that Fou Leblanc would be trapped.  With this move it looks as if Klaus just wants to shut up shop.  I decided to take this moment to make a bid for only my third ever Master Draw in my chessic career by moving Fou Lenoir to defend my backward a3 pawn.  Klaus kindly accepted the offer.  Gameknot analysis showed that I had a positional plus of +0.40 and neither side made any errors whatsoever so I am very pleased with that.  As it is a draw and not a win I am still plain jstevens1 and not TheBlackQueen but at least I have achieved another milestone in my chessic career and I hope I can add to the tally.   Klaus you have played really well and have done nothing wrong but you have simply encountered a lot of resistance which has prevented you from achieving victory here. Do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow I will be back when I have another game to annotate.  Until then have a good read - bye for now - Joanne

1119,29,1,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1nbp3/8/3PQ3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Here white has a nice central control but black has many open lines for an attack.

1124,29,6,b5,b'r2qr1k1/2p1n1pp/p7/1p1Pp3/2P2p1Q/5PP1/PP2K2P/RN5R w - b6',white cant take because black would win a pawn with 21. cxb  axb. 22. ... nxd5

Carlsen alla fine ha preferito optare per una paritÃ  che a quanto riportato dai media ha reso felice anche Anand per il quale una patta con il nero vale qualcosa di piÃ¹ del punteggio effettivo.
A mio parere questa prima partita come quasi tutte le prime partite delle sfide mondiali  puÃ² essere considerata solo uno studio reciproco in attesa di affilare le armi al momento giusto.
Qualitativamente una partita piatta giocata con schemi ben conosciuti e dai quali nessuno dei due contendenti ha preferito uscire.

1364,36,1,Bd6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',This was a odd move. perhaps the bishop should have gone to e7

1369,36,6,Bd7,b'r4rk1/1p1b1ppp/3Pp3/p1P5/1P2p3/P6P/4BPP1/R2R2K1 w - -',again a odd move IMO
1370,36,7,Bc6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/2bPp3/2P5/1R2p3/P6P/4BPP1/R5K1 w - -',Black has been moving the bishop quite a bit here
1371,36,8,2d7,b'r5k1/3P1ppp/2p1p3/2P5/P3p3/7P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',Now this pawn is dangerous obvious move for black is rd8.
1372,36,9,2Rb1,b'3r2k1/3P1ppp/2p1p3/2P5/P3p3/7P/5PP1/1R4K1 b - -',This move defends against rxd7
1373,36,10,2f5,b'3r2k1/3P2pp/2p1p3/2P2p2/P3p3/7P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - f6',This was a blunder in my opinion black should have played h3 instead. Because now a surprise is about to appear.
1374,36,11,3a5,b'3r2k1/3P2pp/2p1p3/P1P2p2/4p3/7P/5PP1/1R4K1 b - -',30. a5?! giving up the pawn on d7? There must be something wrong here....
1375,36,12,3Rxd7,b'6k1/3r2pp/2p1p3/P1P2p2/4p3/7P/5PP1/1R4K1 w - -',black took the bait. now this allows a6.
1376,36,13,3a6,b'6k1/3r2pp/P1p1p3/2P2p2/4p3/7P/5PP1/1R4K1 b - -',Here black still should have played h3.
1377,36,14,3Rb8+,b'1R4k1/r5pp/P1p1p3/2P2p2/4p3/7P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',This forces my pawns queening
1378,36,15,3Rb7+,b'8/rR3kpp/P1p1p3/2P2p2/4p3/7P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',And here black resigned. There's nothing he could do to stop my pawn from queening
1379,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The most common first move. I exclusively play e4 as White if I'm serious about the game.
1380,37,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Likewise I've really grown to appreciate the Sicilian. For similar reasons I suppose. I can be a little fluid in my first 3 moves as White after e4; and this is usually the case when I do Sicilian as well.
1381,37,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I encounter this line less often. This move inhibits Nc3 outright allowing Black to seize d5-e4 easier.
1382,37,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Likewise the usual reply. But not unprepared for...
1383,37,4,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',A knight chase. Usually this would be poor on Black's part but White's back rank remains untouched.
1384,37,5,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',If Bc4 then the chase is reversed after Nb6. If c4 d4 becomes less safe for White and e5 is compromised.
1385,37,6,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the main line as it is anyhow. White tries to displace the Sicilian with a solid pawn phalanx.
1386,37,7,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black has hardly any reason to refuse.
1387,37,8,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now e5 is protected but hard to maintain due to none of White's stronger pieces being in play yet.
1388,37,9,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Inviting exchange and also opens the LSB further deterring 6. e6!

1392,37,13,Ndb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/4P3/1n1P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now the knights are joined and bullying White's queen-side.
1393,37,14,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/1B2P3/1n1P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White is clearly responding to Black now. Seeming to go for a more aggressive path aiming to pin down one of the knights instead of diverting the bishop to c4 or e2 as earlier noted.
1394,37,15,Qa5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/qB2P3/1n1P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A bit more aggressive as well but at this point I didn't feel as though losing the knight to a bishop exchange on c6 should concern Black anymore not with the c pawn gone. Now White needs to seriously consider how to handle the bishop while paying extremely close attention to 9... Nc2+!!
1395,37,16,Nc3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/qB2P3/1n1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Practically forced? This is the only move that addresses both above issues.

I did see this move causing some serious harm to White's queenside but I overlooked one saving move: O-O! Once played all my pins and pressures against White effectively end on the spot...!

1404,37,25,1Rd8,b'3rkb1r/p3pppp/2n5/qp2Pb2/8/1BNn1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R w k -',Black just simply has the tempo/space advantage as well as development to continue threatening all sorts of discovered checks against White. My opponent is in for a seriously uphill battle.
