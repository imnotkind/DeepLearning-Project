He could move d4 but then he would just be throwing his pieces away. It would however open up a line for his bishop to prevent the checkmate. I have now succeeded in removing his King from the back lines. He is forced to move Kg3.

I can now pressure with the pawn because the e5 pawn is protected. His only option becomes the retreat but I suspect that he will move Qf3 to restore his 4 move checkmate.

Since my knight is figuratively pinned I decide to pressure his Queen to weaken his position and also free my knight. The best way to do this is to play Nd4.

He has not only abandoned his position but he has also given me the ideal move of Ne4 which pressures his Queen again.

I can now prepare a four move checkmate alternative (square f2) with the knight and Queen as you'll see in the next moves. Ne4 again will set up this offense position attack his Queen and the two knights also prevent his Queen from stopping the attack.
242,11,12,Qf6,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5qp1/2n1p3/2Bn2P1/2Q5/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Pulling my Queen out prematurely may appear to be an amateur move but it has various purposes. For one I can perform the 4 move checkmate in an alternative fashion within 2 moves: my knight moving to Ne4 (pressuring his Queen at the same time) and my Queen attacking f2. But it also distracts the opponent.
243,11,13,b3,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5qp1/2n1p3/2Bn2P1/1PQ5/P1PP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Here he moves at random with no apparent purpose. He might have had the intention of playing Bb2 but his ignorance costs him on the next move.

He now only has 2 options: Qd3 or Qh3. He cannot move Qe3 because then my knight can then move Nc2 forking the Queen and the King. Also Qf3 is off limits for obvious reasons: my knight can attack that square. Ideally Qd3 prevents the checkmate because once I attack his Queen attacks the f1 square where my Queen could deliver checkmate.
245,11,15,1Qd3,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5qp1/4p3/2Bnn1P1/1P1Q4/P1PP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',He makes the right decision this time and now I can attack.

251,11,21,1Ke1,b'r1b1kb1r/pppp1p1p/6p1/4p3/2Bn2P1/1PNQ4/P1PP1nqP/R1B1K1NR b kq -',As I said this was his only option.

If he does not use his bishop to capture my Knight he is allowing me to fork his a1 rook and his King. But the logical move is to capture Bxd3. Even so his h1 rook is still left unguarded for my Queen to capture.
At this point the opponent resigns because he is down by 16 points in material value with his rook is still endangered. It is a no win situation for the opponent.

This is a good example on how to use your knights although some of the higher ranked players could probably show me 8 different ways to deliver checkmate in this situation.

I will set out the following lyrics to the tune of Only Five Minutes More.  My rendition goes as follows:-

Only one little pawn just one little pawn
but that little pawn is gonna be 
a mighty queen
forever more

and that queen just that one mighty queen
she is gonna sooner or later
to nail your king!

Now I did some calculating and worked out that the h2 pawn looking so innocuous on that square would spell Checkmate for Bob.  The gist is - the rooks will be forced off the board.  Bob's king would be diverted to the queenside to eat up my pawns in the meantime Henry would go over to the kingside and eat some nice tasty black p(r)awns and there would remain the h pawn.  Here we go .....

The computer gives my score here as +1.83 so at the very least it is an OK move.

413,18,50,6Kg4,b'8/7p/8/8/k5KP/8/8/8 b - -',69. Kg4!! - I think this move is the killer.  Henry will move onto the h file and head straight for the pawn on h7 and eat it.  He will then have enough time to step onto g7 and escort the h4 pawn safely to Glendadom where he will have a very tearful reunion with his wife before they round up Bob's king.  However Henry was denied this reunion by Bob waving the white flag on move 71 (my positional score was +13.44 - resignation justified) so Henry had to be content with his footman to accompany him on his long victory march home rather than Glenda - but at least he survives to fight another battle - hope you have had a good read folks - bye for now - Joanne

This game belongs to the Knights of Honour Pawn Structures thread.  This is about a little passed pawn on the a column which was left to create some mayhem similar to the Berzerker Pawn which is what I will raise in the thread later on.  Here is a game against The Dentist who has returned from Vietnam after another long sabbatical.  He does put me under a bit of pressure in the middlegame but he makes the mistake of leaving his dark square bishop in a pin and then I take full advantage of this.  After a double king pawn opening he plays 2. Qf3 which is the Napoleon Opening.  The last time he played that opening against me I lost - see The Dentist Has His Day http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-dentist-has-his-day?gm=17287.  Just hope I don't get bogged down yet again."

537,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hey everyone! This is a tournament game I played recently. The opponent resigned prematurely but I was wondering if the experts could comment on my mistakes.
538,27,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',He he plays the bc4. I looked at the opponents history and he seems to favor the 4 move checkmate.
539,27,2,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',In preparation for this I start to develop my pieces slowly.
540,27,3,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',As I said he pulled out his Queen and i have to block the 4 move checkmate.
541,27,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',This is the usual preventative measure against the 4 move. If anyone uses a different method just let me know. I like this method because it also develops pieces but I'm open to suggestion.
542,27,5,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',I think he intends to challenge my knight with the bishop but I don't see what damage that could do.
543,27,6,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',But since it was a tournament game I decided to take preventative measures. I played h6 to block that attack.
544,27,7,Ne2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Here he obviously intends to castle which gives me 2 free moves to begin to develop and build an attack.
545,27,8,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This is not intended to be an amateur move but I like the position of Bc5. It takes control of the middle of the board and also attacks a weak position in white's line of pawns.
546,27,9,h3,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I assume this move has a duel purpose: It blocks the advance of the knight while also preventing the checkmate of the King behind three pawns later in the game.
547,27,10,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Now that I am certain he will castle on this side I decide to focus my attack on the Kingside pawns.
548,27,11,Qg3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P2QP/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',I looked at his profile and he also favors playing Bh6. This movement of the Queen prepares that move because the pawn is now pinned.
549,27,12,Nh5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/2b1p2n/2B1P3/3P2QP/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Here is where I throw him a line hoping he would take it. In the next few moves I will gain a significant advantage because of a move that appears to be a mistake.
550,27,13,Qxe5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/2b1Q2n/2B1P3/3P3P/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',It appears as if I just gave him a pawn but he actually fell into a trap. I can now play Qa5+.
551,27,14,Bd2,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/q1b1Q2n/2B1P3/3P3P/PPPBNPP1/RN2K2R b KQ -',This was his last chance to prevent the loss of his Queen. Had he moved his King instead he would have prevented a check with Bxf2+.
552,27,15,Bxf2+,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/q3Q2n/2B1P3/3P3P/PPPBNbP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',Now he is in check and his Queen is exposed unprotected. His main option is Kxf2. I can now capture his queen and gain a significant advantage.
553,27,16,Qxe5,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/4q2n/2B1P3/3P3P/PPPBNKP1/RN5R w - -',At this point I thought I had it locked up but it turned out differently than I expected.
554,27,17,1Nbc3,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/4q2n/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPPBNKP1/R6R b - -',He is blocking Qxb2 which would expose his rook although he could have played bc3 in response with his bishop protected but that was his choice.
555,27,18,b5,b'rnb2rk1/p4pp1/2pp3p/1p2q2n/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPPBNKP1/5R1R w - b6',The last two moves were unimportant just building a position on either side. I have now challenged his bishop forcing him to retreat. His only option is Bb3.
556,27,19,Re8,b'rnb1r1k1/p4pp1/2pp3p/1p2q2n/4P3/1BNP3P/PPPBNKP1/5R1R w - -',I can now prevent him from taking pieces with his e4 pawn because I have mated the rook and Queen. I later decide to capitalize on this weakness in his defense.
557,27,20,1g4,b'rnb1r1k1/p4pp1/2pp3p/1p2q2n/4P1P1/1BNP3P/PPPBNK2/5R1R b - g3',He has now challenged my knight but I don't see any danger in it.

560,27,23,d5,b'rnb1r1k1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/3pq3/Np2P1P1/1B1P3P/PPPBN3/4KR1R w - -',At this point the capture of the black pawn would have resulted in checkmate because it would open up the e file where my rook and Queen had mated. I was simply testing for the easy checkmate.
561,27,24,1Bf4,b'rnb1r1k1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/3pq3/Np2PBP1/1B1P3P/PPP1N3/4KR1R b - -',The opponent now challenges my Queen and due to the fact that I would like to keep this strong position I can only move backwards.
562,27,25,1Qe7,b'rnb1r1k1/p3qpp1/2p2n1p/3p4/Np2PBP1/1B1P3P/PPP1N3/4KR1R w - -',The position I chose also provided me with a position that prevents Nc5 protecting my position on his outside knight.
563,27,26,1e5,b'rnb1r1k1/p3qpp1/2p2n1p/3pP3/Np3BP1/1B1P3P/PPP1N3/4KR1R b - -',He smartly attacks my knight and I need to move it. But I also have the option of leaving it unattended because the checkmate is still looming on the e file.
564,27,27,1Rh2,b'r1b1r1k1/p3qpp1/n1p2n1p/3pP3/Np3BP1/1B1P3P/PPP1N2R/4KR2 b - -',Now I need to move my knight because he has defended against the checkmate. He has also inadvertently given himself a potential attacking position for later on in the game.
565,27,28,2Re2,b'r3r1k1/pb2qppn/n1p4p/3pP3/Np1N1BP1/1B1P3P/PPP1R3/4KR2 b - -',Pieces move around most of it insignificant. But as you surely noticed my bishop now protects the lone pawn at c6 and he has moved his rook to the e file. My strong position has faltered.
566,27,29,2Qh4+,b'r3r1k1/pb3ppn/n1p4p/3pP3/Np1N1BPq/1B1P3P/PPP1R3/4KR2 w - -',I decide to put him in check then take the easy pawn to increase my material advantage. This is where I think I made the mistake.
567,27,30,2Nf5,b'r3r1k1/pb3ppn/n1p4p/3pPN2/Np3BP1/1B1P3q/PPP1RR2/4K3 b - -',It became obvious to me that if I took the second pawn he would fork my Queen and King although my pawn protected it. But by taking his knight with the pawn the g file then became clear. This was something I did not notice until it was too late.
568,27,31,gxh6,b'r3r1k1/pb3p1n/n1p4p/3pP3/Np3Bq1/1B1P4/PPP1RR2/4K3 w - -',Now if you notice Rg2 now claims my Queen. I decide to exchange knight and rook for Queen and given my material advantage I had no qualms over it although it was not a conscious decision.
569,27,32,Rxe5+,b'r6k/pb3p1n/n1p4B/3pr3/Np6/1B1P4/PPP3R1/4K3 w - -',We exchange pawns and I prepare to attempt a checkmate. Had he moved Re2 he would have been better off although he did have a good position on me.
570,27,33,Rg8,b'6rk/pb3p1n/n1p4B/3pr3/Np6/1B1P4/PPPK2R1/8 w - -',Now I propose the exchange of Rooks. No problem yet.
571,27,34,2Rf2,b'6rk/pb3p1n/n1p4B/3pr3/Np6/1B1P4/PPPK1R2/8 b - -',He seems to want that pawn and since he is down in material score that is a smart avoidance. But I now see the traditional rook rook checkmate on the back rows.
572,27,35,2Rh5,b'6rk/pb3p1n/n1p4B/3p3r/Np6/1B1P4/PPPK1R2/8 w - -',Had he taken the pawn with his rook I could have delivered checkmate with the two rooks. (30...Rg2 31... Rh1) But he should not take the bate because that would be a beginners mistake. Although his one saving grace was that he could move Kc3 or Ke3 should i put him in check with one of my rooks.
573,27,36,3Rxf7,b'6rk/pb3R1n/n1p4B/3p3r/Np6/1B1P4/PPPK4/8 b - -',One aspect I had forgot at that point was that the King could escape at c3 e3. So I move the pawn forward (d4) to prevent that situation.
574,27,37,3Rxh7+,b'6rk/pb5R/n1p4B/7r/Np1p4/1B1P4/PPPK4/8 b - -',Here he has now made a fair exchange of Rook and Bishop for Rook and knight. Due to the fact that I am ahead I have no worries at this point.
575,27,38,3Kxh7,b'6r1/pb5k/n1p4B/7r/Np1p4/1B1P4/PPPK4/8 w - -',I take rook he takes rook.
576,27,39,3Bxg8+,b'6B1/pb5k/n1p4B/7r/Np1p4/3P4/PPPK4/8 b - -',Now I have two available bishops. I decided to take the white one because the dark bishop only has one option that option being Bf4. The white bishop could have done more damage than the dark one.
577,27,40,3Kxg8,b'6k1/pb6/n1p4B/7r/Np1p4/3P4/PPPK4/8 w - -',Here he resigns for no obvious reason. I was wondering if the pros could review the game and comment where necessary. Hope you enjoyed it!
578,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I always use this opening as I find it lead to a open game which I prefer. It was also what I was taught to do at chess club.

This was a swift game but I usually don't start this aggressive but it worked this time. gooffie resigns

643,31,5,Rc8,b'2rqkb1r/1p1bpp1p/p1np1p2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w k -',The pieces are set for a direct attack for black as well. Whoever has the fastest attack will prevail.
644,31,6,1Nf5,b'2rqkb1r/1p1bpp1p/p1np1p2/5N2/4P3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b k -',Perhaps this move is not the best one. the e7 seems like a weak point but for the time being I don't see any effective way to attack this pawn. Sacrificing the knight on e7 results in the black bishop defending the d6 pawn which is not really helping. Nd5 is also no longer possible for white due to e6. I personally favour f4 threatening e5 to break open the center though I did not check this with a chess engine.
645,31,7,1b5,b'2rqkb1r/3bpp1p/p1np1p2/1p3N2/4P3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w k b6',Black presses the attack.

The knight is attacking the f7 pawn but I don't see a fast way to attack that pawn again. Qd5 isn't a viable option because of Be6 making the bishop more active while winning a tempo in the process.
647,31,9,1b4,b'2rqkb1r/3bpp1p/p1np1p1N/8/1p2P3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w k -',I think this is the quickest way for attacking since the white knight can't effectively attack the black position.
648,31,10,1Ne2,b'2rqkb1r/3bpp1p/p1np1p1N/8/1p2P3/8/PPPQNPPP/2KR1B1R b k -',Another option is 12. Na4 Qa5 13. b3 Nd4 14. Qxd4 Bxh6+ 15. Kb1 Bxa4 16. bxa4 Qxa4 and black wins a pawn while still having active play against white's king. After Nd5 the game would continue the same way it did right now.

Therefore comments and computer analysis do not always agree. Fritz only found a single blunder by each player where a blunder is a move that changes the evaluation by >0.6 pawns.

657,32,3,d5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn1b1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White's advantage is founded on Black's d-pawn taking two moves to reach d5.
658,32,4,1bxc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3p4/2PP2b1/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So now there are some imbalances worth discussing. White has a slight lead in development and a strong presence in the centre but has weaknesses on c4 c3 and potentially d3. Black's pin on f3 has the potential to be a real nuisance. White can try to aggressively exploit the b- and e-files while Black can put pressure on White's weaknesses.

I wanted to play this move before the queen reached the c8-h3 diagonal and to push the bishop to h5 for reasons we will see. (Fritz: +0.64/18)
662,32,8,Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb4/7b/2BP4/2P2N1P/P4PP1/1RBQR1K1 w - -',? Unnecessary e.g. 14... Qf6 15. Bd5?! (15. Rxb8?? Na5) Bh2+. The wasted tempo gives White a clear advantage. (Fritz: 14... Rb8 +1.25/17; 14... Re8 +0.37)

Still the game line leaves us with opposite bishops and chances of a drawish endgame. (Fritz: +0.99/18; according to Fritz the attack was played accurately by both players)
668,32,14,2Qb1,b'1r3k2/1pp2ppp/2Bb4/6q1/3P4/2P4P/P4PP1/1Q2R1K1 b - -',Threatening 23. Qxh7 while maintaining the bishop on the excellent c6 square but this move is also making a rod for White's back. The queen is bound to the b-file and d2 has been gifted to Black's queen. (+1.21/18)

671,32,17,2Kg7,b'1r6/1pp2pkp/2Bb2p1/8/P2P4/2P4P/3q1PP1/1QR3K1 w - -',This simple move deals with all Black's troubles in the position except the material deficit. Now White has to be careful in disentangling his position otherwise Black's simple plan of Qf4 Re8 and Qh2+ could become dangerous. (+0.23/17)

In a queen-less middle game it looks like black has not enough for the pawn. Yet gradually he out-plays white. The computer analysis by Gameknot also shows white having an advantage and it gradually slipping to black. Yet the computer makes no suggestions for improvements for white.

The rook is coming from f8 to c8 and so if white plays Bh6 black is not forced to exchange the valuable black square bishop which is a key defender of the black king.

810,37,16,2c3,b'r4rk1/4q2p/2p3pP/1p2pp2/p3P3/2PP1PQ1/PP1bNP2/1K4RR b - -',An attempt at getting a bishop exchange with pawn.

817,37,23,4Qf6,b'6k1/3q3p/5QpP/2p1P3/p1Pb4/Pp3P2/1P6/KN6 b - -',Tightening the grip
818,37,24,4Qe6+,b'6k1/2q4p/4Q1pP/2p1P3/p1Pb4/Pp3P2/1P6/KN6 b - -',I wonder if f4 would have been a better move. It just lacks strength I guess.
819,37,25,4Qf6+,b'5k2/2q4p/5QpP/2p1P3/p1Pb4/Pp3P2/1P6/KN6 b - -',This was my first opportunity to get a draw.
820,37,26,4Qxf7+,b'5k2/5Q1p/6pP/2p1P3/p1Pb4/Pp3P2/1P6/KN6 b - -',But I thought my position was stronger being pawn up.
821,37,27,4Nc3,b'8/7p/4k1pP/2p1P3/p1Pb1P2/PpN5/1P6/K7 b - -',From this point on analysis of moves was taking a long time. Conditional moves were difficult to make because of the many options. As it stood this looked more like a draw. I offered my opponent a draw...
822,37,28,4g5,b'8/7p/4k2P/2p1P1p1/p1Pb1P2/PpN5/1P6/K7 w - -',He turned it down with an excellent move. It seemed like the killer move and I wasn't supposed to lose.
823,37,29,Kf5,b'8/7p/7P/2p1bkP1/p1P1N3/Pp6/1P6/K7 w - -',Rushed move. Bf5 would have been more powerful. Though not necessarily the winning move.
824,37,30,5Kb1,b'8/7p/7P/6k1/N1Pb4/Pp6/1P6/1K6 b - -',This is where black got the opportunity to win it. I made my move at night and couldn't even sleep because it looked like black had won it. All he needed to do was block my king at this very point with Be3. My king had to get to the h flange in about the same number of moves black needed to queen his pawn. By blocking my king preventing black would have been nearly impossible.
825,37,31,5Kxh6,b'8/7p/7k/8/N1Pb4/Pp6/1P6/1K6 w - -',I was so glad he didn't see the move.
826,37,32,5c5,b'8/8/8/2P3kp/3b4/PpN5/1P6/2K5 b - -',At this point I knew the game was won. A combination of luck and some analysis helped win it. I didn't need to defend the pawn yet unless black captured my C-pawn first.
827,37,33,Qf4+,b'8/8/5k2/8/5q2/P1P5/8/2KQ4 w - -',I was almost stuck here until I realized that a1 was well protected. The first idea was to force a defense that would lead to a check but it didn't look like it was coming.
828,37,34,Qa7,b'8/q7/5k2/8/8/P1P5/8/K2Q4 w - -',The next 14 moves were set as conditional. One would normally resign but there were always opportunities in this game for both players.
829,37,35,8Qb6#,b'8/8/kQK5/8/8/8/8/8 b - -',The only one out of the group. Good play from my opponent.
830,38,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I read a little from a book called Devious Chess last night and its claims that the less trodden paths are more fun tempted me.  This game is at times very unsound but it was interesting.
831,38,1,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',All standard fare.

833,38,3,Qb4,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1qP3n1/2NPB1P1/PP2PPBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',His greed would be better served by 6...Nxe3 7.fxe3 Qxe3.  White is uncomfortable but OK.
834,38,4,e3,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/2q1p3/2P3n1/2NPP1P1/PP1B1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',It is black's moves which prove less trodden over-all but he seems better served by standard fares.  Black rarely can attack without consideration of material and position unless white commits some misstep but he continues to press prod and poke sniffing at white's defenses.
835,38,5,1Bxb7,b'rn2kb1r/pBp2ppp/3p4/2q1p3/2P3b1/2NPP1P1/PP1BNK1P/R2Q3R b kq -',The crucial capture.  White gives up some control along the diagonal but his white squares are strong.
836,38,6,1e4,b'rn2kb1r/pBp2ppp/3p4/2q5/2P1p1b1/2NPP1P1/PP1BNK1P/R2Q3R w kq -',interesting.  12.Bxe4 difuses much of Black's attack but it does so at the expense of the rook capture.
837,38,7,1Nf4,b'rn2kb1r/pBp2ppp/3p4/5q2/2P1NNb1/3PP1P1/PP1B1K1P/R2Q3R b kq -',13...g5 is easily countered but 13...h6 and 14...g5 probably not so much.

839,38,9,1Raxd1,b'rn2kb1r/pBp2ppp/3p4/5q2/2P1NN2/3PP1P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R b kq -',And white holds a slender but real advantage.
840,38,10,1c6,b'rn2kb1r/pB3ppp/2pp4/5q2/2P1NN2/3PP1P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R w kq -',Understandable.  Black would like the trade to be (-2)+5+1-3=+1 and nearly a subsequent theoretical equality.  The only problem is white has considerable freedom on when and if to capture the c6 pawn.  Additionally should black survive to material equality he will have fewer strong attacking pieces.  Black must survive and prove his equality in the endgame.  White also eyes the d6 square and would love the f8 bishop to simply vanish.
841,38,11,1Nc3,b'Bn2kb1r/p4ppp/2p5/3p1q2/2P2N2/2NPP1P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R b k -',White cannot mobilize with enough speed to prevent a pawn on d5.  The square is not the best move for the knight; it is the only move.
842,38,12,1dxc4,b'Bn2kb1r/p4ppp/2p5/5q2/2p2N2/2NPP1P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R w k -',Best is 16...g5 which keeps the pressure on white.  The play is interesting but black is beginning to feel rather underdeveloped.  There are several interesting lines for rapid play.  Perhaps 16.Ncxd5 cxd5 17.Bxd5?
843,38,13,1dxc4,b'Bn2kb1r/p4ppp/2p5/5q2/2P2N2/2N1P1P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R b k -',The rook is now given more scope.

845,38,15,1e4,b'Bn2k2r/p4ppp/2pb4/5q2/2P1PN2/2N3P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R b k -',The white knight is gone should black desire which apparently he does not so white offers harrassment of the black queen.  Black has fewer pieces in play and white likes the situation.
846,38,16,1Qc5+,b'Bn2k2r/p4ppp/2pb4/2q5/2P1PN2/2N3P1/PP1B1K1P/3R3R w k -',Stronger but prone to more immediate harrassment is Qf6 maintaining the pin.
847,38,17,1Be3,b'Bn2k2r/p4ppp/2pb4/2q5/2P1PN2/2N1B1P1/PP3K1P/3R3R b k -',The pawn is poison.  It's capture looses a bishop and allows white to centralize rooks.
848,38,18,2Rhd1,b'Bn3rk1/p4ppp/2pR4/8/2q1PN2/2N1B1P1/PP3K1P/3R4 b - -',Black is losing though not lost.  Black has few quality moves to choose from.  His poor knight cannot move because he has committed it to preventing the bishop's escape.  This may seem like White is effectively down 3 more points because the Bishop lacks scope but Black is down the knight as long as he traps the piece.
849,38,19,2Bxc6,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/2BR4/8/1q2PN2/2N1B1P1/PP3K1P/3R4 b - -',Pawn for pawn.
850,38,20,Qb6+,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/1qBR4/8/4PN2/2N3P1/P2B1K1P/3R4 w - -',Honestly I expected 23...Nxc6 when 24.Rxc6 Rd8 solves black's mobilization problems if not his equality problems.
851,38,21,2Ba4,b'1n3rk1/p1q2ppp/3R4/8/B3PN2/2N1B1P1/P4K1P/3R4 b - -',Loses the piece but was Nb5 viable?
852,38,22,2Bb3,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/3R4/8/4PN2/1Bq1B1P1/P4K1P/3R4 b - -',Few moves for black again.
853,38,23,2Rd1d2,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/3R4/8/4PN2/1B2B1P1/Pq1R1K1P/8 b - -',Once again discouraging black development.
854,38,24,Qh1,b'1n3rk1/B4ppp/3R4/8/4PN2/1B4P1/P2R1K1P/7q w - -',29.Ke3 loses the bishop and makes whites fight difficult but not impossible as black must avoid missteps as much as white must.  And the black knight hangs owing to the back rank mate threat.
855,38,25,3Kf3,b'1B3rk1/5ppp/3R4/8/4PN2/1B3KP1/P2R3q/8 b - -',That black queen sure has been active.
856,38,26,3Ng2,b'1B3rk1/5ppp/3R4/8/4P3/1B3KP1/P2R2N1/7q b - -',Deprived of the perpetual check draw.
857,38,27,3Rxb8,b'1r4k1/5ppp/3R4/8/4P3/1B3KP1/P2R2N1/7q w - -',And the hook has been swallowed.  White would probably win without it but it would be a batte.
858,38,28,3Rd6d8+,b'1r1R2k1/5ppp/8/8/4P3/1B3KP1/P2R2N1/7q b - -',black resigns.
859,39,0,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I thought this was a Sicilian defence (c5 instead of e5) so we end up in a Scotch.
860,39,1,c4,b'r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/8/2PQP3/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq c3',Blocking in a bishop - Bc4 is an alternative or Be3 to prevent Qc5.
861,39,2,Be3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/2q5/2PQP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',Not developing black's pieces for him.

863,39,4,f6,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/2P5/3BP3/8/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Preventing e4-e5 with Nd2-c4 (or -e4) -d6 a possible plan. The bishop on d4 looks a bit silly but not as much as the one on c8. Black could attack the pawns with b6 but white is probably better.
864,39,5,1f4,b'r1b1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/2P5/3BPP2/8/PP4PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq f3',Keeping control of e5
865,39,6,1cxd6,b'r1b1kbnr/pp4pp/2pP1p2/8/3BPP2/8/PP4PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',Probably better than trying to support the pawn on c5
866,39,7,1Nc3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2p2p2/8/1b1BPP2/2N3P1/PP5P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Also possible is Kf2 and my king is fairly safe. It's probably better to avoid the exchange because I have problems defending e4.
867,39,8,1bxc3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp4pp/2p2p2/8/3BPP2/2P3P1/P6P/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Bxc3 is an alternative and I'm not sure which is better but I didn't delete the conditional move in time.
868,39,9,1a4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2n1pp/2p2p2/8/P2BPP2/2P3P1/7P/R3KB1R b KQkq a3',Trying to restrain the queenside majority. Bc4 may have been better to prevent both ...Be6 and ...O-O as after black's next it is no longer possible. (I may have been worried about ...b5 but after Bb3 white is fine.
869,39,10,b6,b'r3k2r/p3n1pp/1pp1bp2/8/P2BPP2/2P3P1/7P/1R2KB1R w Kkq -',A good move. c6-c5 is now a threat so the bishop retreats.
870,39,11,1g4,b'r4rk1/p3nbpp/1pp2p2/5P2/P3P1P1/2P1B3/7P/1R2KB1R b K -',White should probably worry about defending e4 (and activating the rooks) before expanding.
871,39,12,2h4,b'2r2rk1/p3nbpp/1pp2p2/5P2/P3P1PP/2P1B3/8/1R2KB1R b K h3',Ba6 is probably better and it could have been played on the next move too. (20. ... Rc7 21. Bf4)
872,39,13,2c5,b'2r2rk1/p3nbpp/1p3p2/2p2P2/P3P1PP/2P1B3/8/1R2KB1R w K -',Another good move getting space for the knight.
873,39,14,2Rb7,b'2r2rk1/pR2nbpp/5p2/p1p2P2/4P1PP/2P1B3/8/4KB1R b K -',Bad because the knight can easily defend a7 and a5. Better is Ra1 and after 22. ... Nc6 23. Bxc5 Rfe8 24. Ra4 white is not worse.
874,39,15,2Bxc5,b'2r2rk1/pR3bpp/2n2p2/p1B2P2/4P1PP/2P5/8/4KB1R b K -',A mistake as white should now lose a piece. I should have defended my e-pawn before grabbing material.

878,39,19,Bxc6,b'2r3k1/B5pp/2b2p2/R4P2/6PP/2P5/3K4/8 w - -',Now white is not worse (slightly better even) although the opposite-colour bishops should lead to a draw.
879,39,20,3Rxa8+,b'R5k1/6pp/8/5PP1/3B4/2P2b2/3K4/8 b - -',Exchanging rooks is very drawish but I was worried about ... Ra2+ if I declined the exchange. I forgot that opposite-colour bishops favour the attacker which is probably me after Rc5-c7.
880,39,21,g6,b'8/5k1p/2b3p1/5PP1/2PB1K2/8/8/8 w - -',? Bad because white gets a protected passed pawn but it's probably still drawn.
