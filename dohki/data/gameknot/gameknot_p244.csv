0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',N.B. I know I should have played Black in this game but I would rather not replay the game - I will compensate by playing Black in the next two games how about that...
1,0,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Fritz chooses the Slav Defence. I have little experience of this opening but I think I can wing it somehow...
2,0,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I think this transposes into Queen's Gambit Accepted territory. Much more comfortable for me.
3,0,3,a4,b'rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq a3',The classic move to undermine Black's queenside pawn structure in the QGA.

6,0,6,1Qe2,b'rnb1k2r/p3qppp/2p2p2/8/PbBP4/8/1B1NQPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Fritz demonstrates his tactical skill. He likes to have all my pieces nicely pinned to my king.
7,0,7,1O-O,b'r3k2r/p2n2pp/2p1pp2/8/Pb1P4/8/1B1N1PPP/3R1RK1 b kq -',This loses me the a-pawn. I realised that just after having made the move. But then I can create counterplay by attacking the e-pawn...
8,0,8,Kd7,b'r6r/p2k2pp/2p1Rp2/8/nb1P4/8/1B1N1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Oh dear. I've blundered. Now I will lose either the rook or the bishop...for nothing.
9,0,9,2Re6e7+,b'r6r/p2kR1pp/2p2p2/8/1b1P4/8/1n1N1PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Another blunder...don't ask...
10,0,10,2Bxe7,b'r6r/p2kb1pp/2p2p2/8/3P4/8/1n1N1PPP/4R1K1 w - -',"And I resigned. Behind by a rook a bishop and a passed pawn - how could this position get any worse!?

Anyway after my shocking performance against Unleashed Fritz 10 at least I retain a slim lead over the Computers - the scores as they stand are 2.5 to fatcat2 1.5 to the Computers.

I have learned from my mistakes. Never again will I muck up in this horrific way against a computer or a human. And never again will I pile the brandy cream so high on the Christmas pudding..."

194,10,18,2Bc8,b'2b3k1/p3bpp1/1r5p/5P2/2p1P3/Pr5P/1PN3B1/1R1R1K2 w - -',The only move. White seems to have seized the initiative.
195,10,19,3Nc6,b'2b3k1/p3bpp1/2N4p/5P2/2p1P3/P6P/1r4B1/3R1K2 b - -',White threatens the pawn and the bishop and has back rank threats if the bishop moves off the diagonal. 
196,10,20,3Kf8,b'2b2k2/p3bpp1/2N4p/5P2/2p1P3/P6P/1r4B1/3R1K2 w - -',Simplest and with some surprising sting if White takes the pawn.

198,10,22,3Ba6,b'5k2/N3bpp1/b6p/5P2/2p1P3/P6P/1r4B1/3R1K2 w - -',Suddenly the passed pawn and discovered check threat becomes dangerous.
199,10,23,3Nc6,b'5k2/4bpp1/b1N4p/5P2/2p1P3/P6P/1r4B1/3R1K2 b - -',Otherwise the Knight (or bishop) would be lost after c6 .

201,10,25,Rb1,b'5k2/4bpp1/b1N4p/5P2/4P3/P6P/2p3B1/1rR3K1 w - -',White resigns. I think an instructive example of the resilience of the Old Indian defense. 
202,11,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Bishop's Opening Berlin Defense

204,11,2,dxc4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1bp1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now that was not what black had expected.

If Black retreats the bishop white can play Pxc4 and black is only up by the exchange of pawn for bishop. This move allows Pxd3 exchanging the pawn rather than outright losing it.
206,11,4,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P1PQ1N2/2P2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',I had not expected white to be so willing to trade queens when he was down in material. Better for white would have been 9. pxd3 to fix his pawn structure and avoid exchanging queens. But taking the queen now would allow white to fix that doubled isolated pair of pawns on the C file. As much as I wanted to trade queens I wanted to keep white's queen-side pawn structure in ruins even more.
207,11,5,Rxd8,b'r1br2k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',And white played the exchange anyway. Every exchange consolodates black's material advantage. This move also puts the black rook on the only open file.
208,11,6,Rd6,b'r1b3k1/ppp2ppp/2nr1n2/4p1B1/4P3/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',My knight is hungry for that e Pawn. But not while it is pinned to my rook. I expected white to defend that e Pawn now with one of his rooks (f1 would be best leaving the a1 rook to deploy to the open D file of the half-open B file).
209,11,7,h6,b'r1b3k1/ppp2pp1/2nr1n1p/4p1B1/4P3/P1P2N1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',I don't know why white played h3. Sure he doesn't want black's bishop on g4 but saving his pawn was even more important I think. As for black's move I should have taken that e Pawn which forks the bishop and the pawn on c3 letting me trade next move with Nxg5. A pawn and a favorable bishop exchange. I should have taken it. Not sure what I was thinking here with h6.
210,11,8,Be6,b'r5k1/ppp2pp1/2nrbn1p/4p3/4P3/P1P1BN1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now black can take the e pawn that I should have taken last move. But it seems fairly indefensible so I can take it later. I am planning an attack instead beginning with doubling my rooks on the open file.
211,11,9,Nxe4,b'r5k1/p1p2pp1/1pnrb2p/1R2p3/4n3/P1P1BN1P/2P2PP1/5RK1 w - -',Now black eats the e pawn (finally) and threatens the c3 pawn. White cannot seem to save it. In retrospect black's better move here would have been Bc4 forking the two rooks. I moved too quickly - I had my sights on the e pawn and didn't really consider the alternatives. White's best move now would be 16 Nxe5 claiming a pawn for himself.
212,11,10,f6,b'r5k1/p1p3p1/1pnrbp1p/1R2p3/4n3/P1P1BN1P/2P2PPK/5R2 w - -',I am not sue why white chose to move his King. He later told me he didn't see anything better (Nxe5 would have been better). That pawn on c3 is still tempting but it isn't going anywhere and black can take it at his leisure so first black defends his pawn on e5.
213,11,11,Nxc3,b'r5k1/p1p3p1/1pnrbp1p/1R2p3/8/P1n1BN1P/2P2PPK/1R6 w - -',A bad move for white. He wanted to double his rooks on the half-open file but this was not the right time or place for it. Now he loses the exchange. After two moves when I missed an obvious fork white shows me a different way to fork those rooks.
214,11,12,Nd4,b'r5k1/p1p3p1/1p1rbp1p/1R2p3/3n4/P3B2P/2PN1PPK/8 w - -',More forks from the black knights. Black has sensed that white has difficulties accounting for the peculiar moves of knights. Rb2 is weak retreating the rook to defensive duty. Bxd4 is weak exchanging when white is greatly disadvantaged in material. Anything else loses a rook or a pawn.
215,11,13,Nxe3,b'r5k1/p1p3p1/1p1rbp1p/4p3/4R3/P3n2P/3N1PPK/8 w - -',5 consecutive knight moves 4 of which are captures.
216,11,14,Rxd2,b'r5k1/p1p3p1/1p2bp1p/4p3/8/P3R2P/3r1PPK/8 w - -',First the knight eats the unprotected pawn. Then since the bishop is the only piece defending the knight black can take the bishop free of charge. White either exchanges the knights or he doesn't (white chose the exchange generally a bad idea but black's knights have eaten him alive so maybe he's safer getting them off the board for good.)
217,11,15,Rd8d3,b'6k1/p1p3p1/1p2bp1p/4p3/P7/3r1R1P/3r1PPK/8 w - -',Forces the rook exchange. White has nowhere to retreat. This eliminates the last of white's pieces leaving an impossible endgame for white.
218,11,16,Kf7,b'8/p1p2kp1/1p2bp1p/4p3/P7/3r2PP/5P1K/8 w - -',There are many ways for black to win. The easiest is probably promoting the c pawn. White cannot stop it as long as black keeps his rook on the D file and defends the rook against white's king. But white had said something to me about wanting to see how I finished out the game so I was determined not to promote any pawns. This dragged it out a bit but I felt it provided a more instructional ending for white.
219,11,17,g5,b'8/p1p5/1p2bp1p/4pkp1/P6P/3r2PK/5P2/8 w - g6',Move the king up (he's crucial to a checkmate with lesser pieces) and also clear out the white pawns. That's the plan. White doesn't have anything really good. h5 might have stalled black a little longer.
220,11,18,Bd5+,b'8/p1p5/1p3p1p/3bp3/P5kP/3r4/5PK1/8 w - -',It's not about eating pawns now. That pawn on h4 is safe from black - I have better things to do.
221,11,19,Rxf3,b'8/p1p5/1p3p1p/3bp3/P5kP/5r2/6K1/8 w - -',Blocking with the pawn was the wrong answer but white has nothing else anyway. I choose to capture with the rook because it limits the white king to just 4 squares and two moves from now he will have only 2 squares.
222,11,20,Kg3,b'8/p1p5/1p3p1p/3bp2P/P7/6k1/5r2/6K1 w - -',This would be stalemate except for the white pawn on a4. After white moves his pawn to a5 black cannot play Pxa5 or he gives white a draw.
223,11,21,Re2,b'8/p1p5/1p3p1p/P2bp2P/8/6k1/4r3/6K1 w - -',It's mate in 1 if white plays any pawn move. White can delay the inevitable by chasing the black rook: 38 Kf1 Rh7. Then it's a foot race with the black king chasing the white king to the far side of the board until white has no more room to run at which point he will be checkmated on b1. 
224,11,22,Re1#,b'8/p1p5/Pp3p1p/3bp2P/8/6k1/8/4r1K1 w - -',38 a6 was instant death for white as would have been 38 Pxb6. Kf1 lets white live for 6 more moves but I think white was just ready to call it a day.

White would like to trade into a good knight vs. bad bishop end game.  The pawns are symmetrical so any endgame would be drawish.
241,12,16,c6,b'2k5/1p1n1p2/p1p3p1/3N1b1p/2P4P/1P3P2/P5P1/4B1K1 w - -',28...Bd3 would probably draw but Black apparently is playing for a win.

White hopes to tie Black down to defending the pawn weakness on the kingside and forcing a penetration of the White King into Black's position.
243,12,18,3Bf2,b'8/5p2/p3k3/1pp1np1p/2P4P/1PK2P2/P4BP1/8 b - -',Fritz doesn't like this move and suggests 38. cxb5 axb5 39 Bxe5 Ke5 40 a4 bxa4 41 bxa4 and White wins.
244,12,19,3Kd6,b'8/5p2/p2k4/1pp1np1p/2P4P/1PK2P2/P4BP1/8 w - -',I felt that Black was playing for a win.  I also felt that there little danger of White losing the game; but before making active attempts to win I waited to see what Black would try.

These are the only two responses to 1.e4 I have had any significant experience with (and for the record I gave up Alekhine's Defence in June) so I played 1...e5 of which you do not really need so much experience to play competently.
252,13,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. This is by far the most common 1.e4 e5 opening at grandmaster levels. Obviously White is putting pressure on Black's e-pawn.
253,13,3,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The oldest response the Steinitz Defence. I play the Cozio Defence (3...Nge7) more often but this temporarily compromises Black's dark-squared bishop giving White a dynamic advantage. I tend to prefer more sedate positions while playing Fritz. The problem with the Steinitz Defence is that it pins Black's developed knight.

My opponent in Game 1 those of you who looked at it will remember was a rather battered handheld chess device Star Chess by name - I could easily see when it was uncomfortable with a position by the fact that a little red light started blinking on its side. But what went on in Fritz's silicon chips was unknown to me.

However Fritz's speed in moving has slowed down and has also begun to emit a tiny whirring noise. This is either Fritz needing some more thought or distracting tactics.

Black cannot win with just a bishop advantage - he has to break the pawn formation and find a way to get a pawn advantage and eventually promote the pawn. This move will do it. It helps that white's two rooks are on the far side of the board where they are far removed from defending the ruined king-side pawns.

I didn't expect anything to come out of moving my Knight I just wanted my Queen to protect against black's tricks. Also moving the Knight to D5 puts it in range to protect the Bishop if black responds by finally playing Ra8

This game was played against someone with a rating more than 500 pts higher than me at the time.  I ended up losing this game but I wanted to share it because it is by far the best game I have ever played in a tournament setting.

I think Joanne went wrong at the 43rd move. The line suggested by charleshiggie in his previous comment keeps White in the fight but I rather prefer 43.Kh5!? as also offering chances of attack: 43.Kh5 Rxe4 44.Rxb6 Kd7 (say) 45.Ra6 f5 (to bring the rook to g4) 46.Kg6!? (I dislike 46.Rxa5 Rg4 as the WK is left cut off on the h-file) ...Rg4  47.Kf6 Rxg3 48.Rxa5 f4 49.Ra7  Kc6 50.Kxe6 Rh3 51.Kf4 Rxh4 52.Kg5 Rh1 53.Kxf4 Re1 54.Ra6 . This is just a sample line and maybe both sides could find improvements but in this line Black's win seems as far off as ever. Note that the King's advance to h5 broadens White's scope retaining the (albeit slender) chances of promoting the h-pawn but creating also prospects of bringing the WK in amongst Black's centre pawn phalanx. From its adavanced position the WK might get the opportunity tho shepherd the h-pawn home. In the position White had at that point I feel sure I would have played 43.Kh5."

Black brings the king over to block the passed pawn and retains passed pawns. White can't do anything to force the pawn to queen.

I don't think the move played deserves the two queries - or even just one. There isn't really a whole lot to choose between the move played and 46.Kg2. Of course White can hope Black will throw away the win by 46.Kg2 a3?? 47.h6! and there's no way to stop the h-pawn accept by a perpetual (47...Rb2  48.Kg3 Rb3  49.Kg2! - not 49.Kh4?? Rb1! - etc). But 46...Kf8 47.h6 (Ra7!?) Kg8 48.Rg7  Kh8 49.Ra7 and White's counterattack has been held to a standstill. Since 46.Ke2 don't look at all enticing only the text move remains..."

Fortunately 2 rooks can only direct an effective attack on a single pawn with queen support which takes 2 moves so I can read in advance a possible attack on a specific pawn and then move the targeted pawn into safety or the other pawn into a support position while making sure the queen is also in position to protect the targeted pawn."

875,39,33,4Ke6,b'8/p1R5/3pk3/1p6/3R4/1PPp3p/P4q2/2K5 w - -',"I had initially considered Ke5 but it potentially allowed my king to be chased by his c-rook to a point where my queen would have to be given away and hence a loss.

This scenario forced me to evaluate King-Queen combos that had advantages against 2 rooks even if they are doubled. Close-contact appeared to be key (I believe rooks fare poorly in close-contact scenarios against King-Queen because they have to split-up in order to mount an effective attack) as well as diagonal domination of key rook-attack squares. Of course I would prefer scenarios where his rooks were not doubled ... but that's not my call.

At the same time I considered how I was going to promote the h-pawn for the win ..."
876,39,34,4Rxd3,b'8/p1R5/3pk3/1p6/8/1PPR3p/P4q2/2K5 b - -',Inevitable and his best move actually.
877,39,35,4Qf5,b'8/p1R5/3pk3/1p3q2/8/1PPR3p/P7/2K5 w - -',I believe this is my best reply. Attacks his rook prevents Rh7 and keeps my pawn temporarily safe. He now has to move his rook away or 46. Kc2 to protect it (but gets into a pinned-rook scenario).
878,39,36,Kf6,b'8/p1R5/3p1k2/1p3q2/8/1PP1R2p/P7/2K5 w - -',The fact that I can do this now is because I chose 44. ...Ke6 instead of 44. ...Ke5.
879,39,37,4Rxa7,b'8/R7/3p1k2/1p3q2/8/1PP1R2p/P7/2K5 b - -',"Again an unexpected move. My original plan was to push the h-pawn but now thanks to my earlier blunder I recognized another opportunity ... Qg5 pins the rook *and* threatens it forcing his king to move up to protect it (and beautifully still forced to endure the pin) or forcing his rook to double up along the e-file.

Normally the doubled rooks would mean a draw at least (for him) due to perpetual check. However my trusty d pawn (which has incidentally served as my king's bodyguard over the last 20 moves) prevents that! This means after a certain point he loses steam in the attack and allows me to (finally) promote my h-pawn.

So he needs 2 moves ... Kd2 and Re7 (in any order I think) to secure his weak rook. This allows me regardless of his options to make the h2 move."
880,39,38,h2,b'8/4R3/3p1k2/1p4q1/8/1PP1R3/P6p/2K5 w - -',"I thought he still had a possible game at this point ... one of the lines I thought about reduced this to a Rook-vs-Queen game but with a massive pawn advantage (*and* King support) on the queen side. I was not 100% sure at this point if my lone queen and my remaining pawns could stop it (I should be but was not sure).

This is definitely the best chess game I've played so far even if I had lost. See-saw scenarios with nail-biting moves that were reduced to single-tempo advantages."
