0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here's a kingside attack that actually worked!  My games recently have been littered with the other sort hence my plummeting rating.
1,0,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I revert to an old favourite not actually considered a cutting edge response to the Najdorf these days.
2,0,2,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I play this in order that if Black advances his d-pawn I don't have to attend immediately to the bishop's safety.  From b3 it still drills through to f7 traditionally Black's weak point on the kingside.
3,0,3,f4,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq f3',This is more aggressive than and statistically slightly superior to 8. 0-0 if my memory serves me correctly.
4,0,4,f5,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/5P2/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White hastens to attack while Black's king is still in the centre.
5,0,5,e5,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4pP2/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The natural response counter-attacking White's central knight but leaving a slight hole at d5.
6,0,6,1Nde2,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4pP2/4P3/1BN5/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',From here the N can move to c3 to support the other N when it has gone to d5.  Alternatively it can go to g3 to defend e4 and potentially go via h5 to g7 or f6.  These options seem more flexible than those arising from 10. Nf3.
7,0,7,1Qc5,b'rnb1k2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2q1pP2/4P3/1BN5/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black occupies White's weakest diagonal preventing castling.
8,0,8,1Na4,b'rnb1k2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2q1pP2/N3P3/1B6/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So White harasses the enemy queen immediately.
9,0,9,1Bd2,b'rnb1k2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/q3pP2/N3P3/1B6/PPPBN1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The check has helped White to develop his remaining minor piece.
10,0,10,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4pP2/N3P3/1B6/PPPBN1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',At last White can castle.  The main advantage of this manoeuvre is to develop the rook as the king doesn't look much safer on g1 than on e1 given that gaping diagonal.
11,0,11,1b5,b'rnb1k2r/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/1p2pP2/N3P3/1B6/PPPBN1PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq b6',The N was controlling b6 and c5 so Black's pawn thrust is very pertinent especially as the QB can now develop to b7.
12,0,12,Nbd7,b'r3k2r/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/1p2pP2/4P3/1BN3N1/PPPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black opens up his castling options developing his final minor piece.
13,0,13,1Kh1,b'r3k2r/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/1p2pP2/4P3/1BN3N1/PPPB2PP/R2Q1R1K b kq -',Before launching an attack White puts his king on a less exposed square.  I'd be interested in opinions as to whether this move in this position is a necessary prophylactic move or a waste of tempo.
14,0,14,1O-O,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/1p2pP2/4P3/1BN3N1/PPPB2PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Black makes his choice.  Now White knows where to concentrate his fire.  His pieces are reasonably well placed for action on either wing at this point but the bishops exploit their long range potential in the direction of the kingside.  So a kingside attack it is...
15,0,15,1Rc1,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/1p2pP2/4P3/1BN3N1/PPPB2PP/2RQ1R1K b - -',First White shifts the QR to c1 to oppose the enemy Queen and support the c-pawn in the event its other defenders desert it.  Possibly another wasted move or proper completion of development before undertaking decisive action?
16,0,16,1Nb6,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/pn1p1n2/1p2pP2/4P3/1BN3N1/PPPB2PP/2RQ1R1K w - -',This N appears to be heading for c4 or supporting an advance to d5.
17,0,17,1Nh5,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/pn1p1n2/1p2pP1N/4P3/1BN5/PPPB2PP/2RQ1R1K b - -',The first aggressive gesture on the kingside aimed at removing a key defender the Nf6.
18,0,18,1Nxe4,b'r4rk1/1bq1bppp/pn1p4/1p2pP1N/4n3/1BN5/PPPB2PP/2RQ1R1K w - -',Black seizes the abandoned e-pawn.
19,0,19,Bxe4,b'r4rk1/2q1bppp/pn1p4/1p2pP1N/4b3/1B6/PPPB2PP/2RQ1R1K w - -',Black is a pawn up and has a powerful looking central bishop.  In return White nearly has control of f6 and an attack on g7.
20,0,20,2Qg4,b'r4rk1/2q1bppp/pn1p4/1p2pP1N/4b1Q1/1B6/PPPB2PP/2R2R1K b - -',White threatens mate in 1.
21,0,21,2g6,b'r4rk1/2q1bp1p/pn1p2p1/1p2pP1N/4b1Q1/1B6/PPPB2PP/2R2R1K w - -',The threat has provoked a weakness in Black's defensive position.
22,0,22,2fxg6,b'r4rk1/2q1bp1p/pn1p2P1/1p2p2N/4b1Q1/1B6/PPPB2PP/2R2R1K b - -',An interesting choice.  The other option was 21. f6 after which White has to single-mindedly manoeuvre his Q via g5 and h6 to g7 to deliver mate.  Black has to prevent the manoeuvre at all costs.
23,0,23,2Bxg6,b'r4rk1/2q1bp1p/pn1p2b1/1p2p2N/6Q1/1B6/PPPB2PP/2R2R1K w - -',Black's powerful bishop assumes the role of a pawn.
24,0,24,2Bh6,b'r4rk1/2q1bp1p/pn1p2bB/1p2p2N/6Q1/1B6/PPP3PP/2R2R1K b - -',White's QB attacks the defending rook and the g7 square.
25,0,25,2Bxf7+,b'r3r1k1/2q1bB1p/pn1p2bB/1p2p2N/6Q1/8/PPP3PP/2R2R1K b - -',Now f7 falls.  The B on g6 cannot recapture because of the pin by the Q.  Te K can't capture because of the Rf1.  All White's pieces except his QR are involved in the attack and mate is inevitable: 23....Kh8 24. Bg7++
26,1,0,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',This was the starting position in the Colle-Zuckertort match. 
27,1,1,Nbd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This move seems good. Bringing the knight in to the game is possibly slightly better than the alternative moves which to my mind would be the highly aggressive 8. Ne5 or the docile 8. a3. 
28,1,2,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Putting pressure on the most critical diagonal and at also down the vulnerable c-file. 
29,1,3,cxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2Pp4/1P1BPN2/PB1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Opening up seemed the only way forward. 
30,1,4,Nb4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/1nPP4/1P1B1N2/PB1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Stopping this move would have been the main point of an early 8. a3 from white. I really hoped Muff would let me trade with his bishop. 
31,1,5,1Bb1,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/1nPP4/1P3N2/PB1N1PPP/RB1Q1RK1 b - -',... but understandably he had other plans for his bishop!
32,1,6,1bxc4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/8/1nPP4/5N2/PB1N1PPP/RB1Q1RK1 b - -',Less sure about this. I did not really like the center-controlling pawns but I found nothing better to do. 
33,1,7,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/8/1nPP1b2/5N2/PB1N1PPP/RB1Q1RK1 w - -',I had to get away from pawn onslaught somehow! (... Be7 is of coures an alternative but it looks more passive)
34,1,8,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP1b2/P4N2/1B1N1PPP/RB1Q1RK1 w - -',A slight loss of self esteem for my knight. 
35,1,9,Bxd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1BQb1PPP/RB3RK1 w - -',The bishop might have been a valuable resource but this knight was just too annoying!
36,1,10,Na5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/n7/2PP4/P4N2/1B1Q1PPP/RB3RK1 w - -',The knight makes another attempt ... may be wiser this time. The there is a double threat in this move: (1) the pawn on c4 is hanging and (2) there is the nice fork on b3. 
37,1,11,Nb3,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/4N3/2PP4/Pn6/1B1Q1PPP/RB3RK1 w - -',The pawn decoy worked!
38,1,12,Nxa1,b'r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/4N3/2PP4/P7/1BQ2PPP/nB3RK1 w - -',The knight happily trades its life for the life of a rook!
39,1,13,Qe7,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4N3/2PP4/P7/2Q2PPP/BB3RK1 w - -',To protect the knight. Otherwise 19. Ng4 would be crushing (given the mate threat on h7).
40,1,14,g6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qp1p/4pnp1/8/2PP2N1/P7/2Q2PPP/BB3RK1 w - -',Protecting from the nest. 
41,1,15,Kg7,b'r1b2r2/pp2qpkp/4pnpN/8/2PP4/P7/2Q2PPP/BB3RK1 w - -',The only option here. Kh1 would have lost the knight due to d5 and Ng4. 
42,1,16,Qxa3,b'r1b2r2/pp3pkp/4pnpN/8/2PP4/q7/3Q1PPP/BB3RK1 w - -',I can resist anything ... except temptations!
43,1,17,2g4,b'r1b2r2/pp2qpkp/5npN/3p4/2P3P1/8/1B1Q1P1P/1B3RK1 b - g3',This is a truly brilliant move which I had missed completely! It immediately puts my poor pinned knight in danger and I cannot even get out of the pin!
44,1,18,2d4,b'r1b2r2/pp2qpkp/5npN/8/2Pp2P1/8/1B1Q1P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',I thought long about what to do ... and then I found d4!
45,1,19,2Qxd4,b'r1b2r2/pp2qpkp/5npN/8/2PQ2P1/8/1B3P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',"This surprised me as it would let me take the white knight. The idea behind d4 was ""you pin me I pin you"". That is if Muff took with the bishop I would slide my rook over to d8! "
46,1,20,2g5+,b'r1b2r2/pp2qp1p/5npk/6P1/2PQ4/8/1B3P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',g5+! Now I faced another tough decision whether to take or not to take. And then of course ...
47,1,21,2Kxg5,b'r1b2r2/pp2qp1p/5np1/6k1/2PQ4/8/1B3P1P/1B3RK1 w - -',... I take!
48,1,22,2Qd2+,b'r1b2r2/pp2qp1p/5np1/6k1/2P5/8/1B1Q1P1P/1B3RK1 b - -',Good move!
49,1,23,3Qe3,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/5np1/4Rb1k/2P5/4Q3/1B3P1P/1B4K1 b - -',? e2 was possibly better. 
50,1,24,Ng4,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rb1k/2P3n1/4Q3/1B3PKP/1B1q4 w - -',In hindsight this was a mistake. Qg4 was possibly better. 
51,1,25,Kg5,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rbk1/2P3n1/7Q/1B3PKP/1B1q4 w - -',I thought my king was rather safe at this point ...
52,1,26,3f4+,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rbk1/2P2Pn1/7Q/1B4KP/1B1q4 b - f3',... which I now doubted. Another brilliant move from my opponent. Take or not to take? ... 
53,1,27,3Kxf4,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rb2/2P2kn1/7Q/1B4KP/1B1q4 w - -',... as usual take!
54,1,28,3Qg3+,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rb2/2P2kn1/6Q1/1B4KP/1B1q4 b - -',!
55,1,29,3h4+,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rbk1/2P3nP/6Q1/1B4K1/1B1q4 b - h3',... alternatively h3. 
56,1,30,3Qf4,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rb1k/2P2QnP/8/1B4K1/1B1q4 b - -',Threatening checkmate on g5!
57,1,31,3Qd8,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4Rb1k/2P2QnP/8/1B4K1/1B6 w - -',I was now up 8 points and thought I could ward off the death treat from behind. This move was probably my biggest mistake yet!
58,1,32,3Bxf5,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4RB1k/2P2QnP/8/1B4K1/8 b - -',37. Bxf5!! Taking with the rook would not have been good in fact quite bad for black!
59,1,33,3Bc1,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/6p1/4nB1k/2P2Q1P/8/6K1/2B5 b - -',Brilliant move! Rather than taking my knight as I was sure he would do my opponent put up annother death threat! This time on h6. 
60,1,34,3g5,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/8/4nBpk/2P2Q1P/8/6K1/2B5 w - -',The only possible response. 
61,1,35,3hxg5,b'r2q1r2/pp3p1p/8/4nBPk/2P2Q2/8/6K1/2B5 b - -',hxg5! The right choice! Now there is a yet a new mate threat. This time by Qh2. When pressured like this there is only one gentlemany thing to do ...
62,1,36,3Qd4,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/8/4nBPk/2Pq1Q2/8/6K1/2B5 w - -',... to sacrifice his queen! (There is no other way to get out of the check mate threat).
63,1,37,4Qxd4,b'r4r2/pp3p1p/8/4nBPk/2PQ4/8/6K1/2B5 b - -',At this point rather ironically we reached material equality! But as there was no way ahead to ward of future checkmates I resigned! I am thankful to my brilliant opponent for an amazing game - a victory well deserved!
64,2,0,c3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',c3?  Perhaps d3 or d4 so your bishop is not blocked and your knight can take c3
65,2,1,b3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np2p1/4p3/2B1P3/1PP2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',b3?  Now you could have move d4 and attacked the centre.
66,2,2,d4,b'r2qk1nr/pppb1pbp/2np2p1/4p3/2BPP3/1PP2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',good you got to d4
67,2,3,Be3,b'r3k2r/pppbqpbp/2np1np1/4p3/2BPP3/1PP1BN2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Why retreat?  You have my knight frozen against the queen.
68,2,4,1Bxf7,b'1k1r3r/pppbqBb1/3p1np1/4n2p/3NP3/1PP1B3/P2N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I'm not sure why you sacrificed your biship here.  Was this part of a plan?
69,2,5,1Bg5,b'1k1r3r/pppb1qb1/3p1np1/4n1Bp/3NP3/1PP5/P2N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Your bishop may have been better off on e3.  You have a potential discovered attack on a7 by moving the knight off of d4.  If you could get your queen to a4 (move b3 to b4) you have a possible checkmate with Qa7.
70,2,6,1Nd2f3,b'1k1r3r/pppb1q2/3p1npb/4n1Bp/3NP3/1PP2N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I think you were getting tired here.  This should work but then on your next move you take with the pawn rather than the other knight.  I think your plan was with the knight rather than opening up your king.
71,2,7,1gxf3,b'1k1r3r/pppb1q2/3p1npb/6Bp/3NP3/1PP2P2/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is the beginning of the fall once you start opening up your king.  Things really started to unravel here.
72,2,8,1h3,b'1k1r3r/pppb1q2/3p1np1/6bp/3NP3/1PP2P1P/P4P2/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This is an oops.
73,2,9,1Kh2,b'1k1r3r/ppp2q2/3p1np1/6bp/3NP3/1PP2P1b/P4P1K/R2Q1R2 b - -',Forgot about your rook.
74,2,10,2c4,b'1k1r3r/ppp2q2/3p1np1/8/2PNPb1p/1P3P2/P4PK1/R4Q2 b - -',Are you protecting your queen?  Don't forget about your king.
75,2,11,2Qxh3,b'1k1r3r/ppp2q2/3p4/5N2/2P1Pbn1/1P5Q/P4P2/R5K1 b - -',Desperation or just an oversight?
76,2,12,2Rf1,b'1k1r4/ppp2q2/3p4/5N2/2P1Pbn1/1P3r2/P7/5RK1 b - -',This is good for me since I am so far ahead now I don't mind exchanging pieces.  This was your only other attacking piece.
77,2,13,Nxf5,b'1k1r4/ppp2q2/3p4/5n2/2P1Pb2/1P6/P4K2/8 w - -',And now there were none.  It is really over here since you have no attacking pieces.  A stalement is always a possiblity though.

79,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',e4 is a useful openning for using bishop and quenn.
80,3,1,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And this move does not give you any advantages. Actually it stops your upgrading.
81,3,2,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/1pppppp1/p6p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Center of the board is going to be mine... This is a big advantage.
82,3,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/2ppppp1/pp5p/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',As you see i am moved my pieces to center. But opponent could not yet.
83,3,4,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/1bppppp1/pp5p/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is a small move. But after this move you can win the game easily. Because as i said at start: if you dont upgrade your pieces that means you have not pieces...

87,4,0,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Scotch game considered fairly moribund until revivified somewhat late last century by Harry Kasparov.
88,4,1,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The most usual and probably best response.
89,4,2,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This inaugurates the Scotch Game.  If White is more adventurous he can try various gambits (Scotch Goring) by 4.Bc4 or 4.c3.  Both lead to interesting play.
90,4,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black's range of options here is huge.  One possibility a sometime favorite of W. Steinitz is 4...Qh4.  I've tried it myself on GK though on the second occasion it got me into some hot water...
91,4,4,bxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/2p5/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',An automatic response you might think but in fact much more frequently played is 5...Qf6 threatening a mate on f2.  White usually responds with 6.Qf3 whereat Black takes 6...bxc6.
92,4,5,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Instead 6...Qh4 has been tried a number of times... with indifferent success...
93,4,6,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Better than pushing the pawn to e5 I think.
94,4,7,Bf4,b'r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',(!?) Completing the mobilisation of the minor pieces.  More usual here is 8.0-0 probably because it is safer.

Probably White ought to castle out of trouble right now: 9.0-0 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 Rxe4 11.Bxf7! (Desperado!) 11...Kxf7 12.Qf3 Rxf4 (White was threatening 13.Bxc7+) 13.Qxf4+ Kg6 (Not 13...Kg8 14.Qc4+ picking up the bishop).  White would have had work to do to survive with a rook for 2 bishops but his prettier pawns will have been a help.  Possibly White could enquire after a draw by 14.Qg3+ with the idea 14...Qg5 15.Qxc7.
96,4,9,Qf3,b'r1bqr1k1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1PB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',(?) 9.0-0

98,4,11,1Rd1,b'r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2bp4/2B1PB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K -',(??) ... and this move ought to have been fatal.  Probably best is to cover up by 10.e5 and hang on.  The pin on the e-pawn would be matched (more or less) by the one on Black's d-pawn.   Although not as effective as the bishop move even 10.0-0-0 is better than the text though 10...Bg4 would have been very nasty.
99,4,12,1dxe4,b'r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1pB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R w K -',(?!) Not the best as it happens.  10...Bg4 would just about have been curtains.  Now White gets a reprieve...
100,4,13,1Nxe4,b'r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1NB2/5Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K -',(?) I think James must have overlooked the fact that after 11.Rxd8 the e8-rook would have been (half-)pinned and could have been exchanged off.  After 11.Rxd8! exf3+ 12.Rxe8+ Nxe8 13.gxf3 Nd6 the game would have been near on even. Now Black wins a piece...
101,4,14,1Qxe4,b'r1bq2k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1QB2/8/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K -',(?) That Black has an immediately decisive continuation here is not easy to spot as the move he does play (12...Qxd1+) seems so obvious and it gives Black a big advantage as well.  Objectively best was 12.Be2 accepting the loss of a minor piece.  But Savielly Tartakover once observed with hard-headed acuity: 'Sometimes the second-best move is better than the best move!' 
102,4,15,1Qxd1+,b'r1b3k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1QB2/8/PPP2PPP/3qK2R w K -',(!?) Black could have forced White's capitulation with 12...Bxf2+! 13.Ke2 Bg4+! winning White's Q whilst saving his own.
103,4,16,1Re1,b'r1b3k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b5/2B1nB2/8/PPP2PPP/3KR3 b - -',Mobilising his rook and apparently pinning the knight against the empty e8-square.  Unfortunately Black's knight is not pinned.  Of the two options available (...Nd6; and ...Nxf2+) Black chooses the more aggressive...
104,4,17,Bf5,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b2b2/2B2B2/8/PPP2nPP/2K1R3 w - -',Possibly more circumspect was 15...Bd6 but this move contains some interesting surprises.
105,4,18,1Re5,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b1Rb2/2B2B2/8/PPP2nPP/2K5 b - -',As you would expect.  Doesn't this rook fork win one of the bishops and restore the material balance?
106,4,19,1Bxc2,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b1R3/2B2B2/8/PPb2nPP/2K5 w - -',(?) Bringing the game back to near-equality.  With 16....Rd8! and the threat on mate on d1 Black would enabled himself to keep his extra piece e.g.: 16...Rd8 17.Be2 Rd5!
107,4,20,1Rxc5,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2R5/2B2B2/8/PPb2nPP/2K5 b - -',Probably the better of the two captures available.
108,4,21,1Bd3,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2R5/2B2B2/3b4/PP3nPP/2K5 w - -',Slightly better might have been 17...Be4.

111,4,24,2Kc2,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/8/8/2R2B2/3n4/PPK3PP/8 b - -',Rather risky.  Black could now have been a real nuisance and played 20...Ne1.  Mind you White might have been equally obdurate and tried 21.Kc1 in response: 'Care to repeat moves?'  
112,4,25,2Nxf4,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/8/8/2R2n2/8/PPK3PP/8 w - -',But Black's not interested in such finesses...
113,4,26,2Rxf4,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/8/8/5R2/8/PPK3PP/8 b - -',This rook ending although Black has an extra pawn is well-nigh even.  Black's split pawns on the Q-side somewhat depreciate his extra pawn on the other wing.
114,4,27,2Kc4,b'r7/p1p2pkp/6p1/8/2K2R2/8/PP4PP/8 b - -',(!?) A little dubious I feel.  White could just about have forced a draw at this or the previous move by attacking the c- and a-pawns: 23.Rc4 Rc8 24.Ra4 Ra8 etc. Now the rook's access to the Q-side is blocked and King has almost lost touch with his own pawns...
115,4,28,2Rd8,b'3r4/p1p2pkp/6p1/8/2K2R2/8/PP4PP/8 w - -',Right idea but the rook ought to have moved one further square.  Possibly Black fancying his chances with an extra pawn in aa pawn ending was hoping that White would offer a rook exchange by 24.Rd4...
116,4,29,2b4,b'3r4/p1p2pkp/6p1/8/1PK2R2/8/P5PP/8 b - b3',(?!) Better was 24.Kc3 keeping the enemy rook out of the second rank.  But White could also have contemplated going into the pawn ending after 24.Rd4! Rxd4!? 25.Kxd4 - a very interesting line of play.  For instance 25...f5 26.Ke5 h6 27.h4! looks very favorable for White.
117,4,30,2Rd6,b'8/p1p2pkp/3r2p1/8/1PK2R2/8/P5PP/8 w - -',(?) Too passive.  24...Rd2 was indicated and Black would have had a distinct edge.
118,4,31,a6,b'8/2p2pkp/p2r2p1/2K5/1P3R2/8/P5PP/8 w - -',It was not too late for ...Rd2.
119,4,32,2Rd4,b'8/2p2pkp/p2r2p1/2K5/1P1R4/8/P5PP/8 b - -',(!) Well played!  Surely Black dare not accept this exchange offer?
120,4,33,2Rxd4,b'8/2p2pkp/p5p1/2K5/1P1r4/8/P5PP/8 w - -',Overestimating his chances in the ensuing endgame - though it is easy to suppose Black is fine here.  After all the recapture lures the White King away from the Q-side where Black is weakest...
121,4,34,Kf6,b'8/2p2p1p/p4kp1/8/1P1K4/8/P5PP/8 w - -',(!?) Possibly already Black ought to have been looking to counterattck on the K-side - advancing his pawns...
122,4,35,2Kc5,b'8/2p2p1p/p4kp1/2K5/1P6/8/P5PP/8 b - -',(!) A nice little finesse.  In this instance 28.Kd5 would seem just as good and indeed it is.  Black will respond 28...Ke7.  But in moving at once to the c-file White offers Black the opportunity to move 28...Ke6? instead whereat 29.Kc6 grabs the 'Opposition' and an extra tempo.
123,4,36,2Ke7,b'8/2p1kp1p/p5p1/2K5/1P6/8/P5PP/8 w - -',Black doesn't buy it (nor was there any reason that he should).
124,4,37,h5,b'3k4/1Kp2p2/p5p1/7p/1P6/8/P5PP/8 w - h6',(!?) Launching his counterattack at last.  In ordinary circumstances one might have been inclined to play the 'candidate' pawn first: ...f5.  But Black is hoping to accelerate the process by inducing a weakness in White's K-side.  Had White's attack on the other wing been less well advanced this would have been a very good plan.
125,4,38,3Kxa6,b'3k4/2p2p2/K5p1/7p/1P6/8/P5PP/8 b - -',(!?) Sufficient.  But I would seriously have considered playing 31.a4 first. Then supposing Black were to play 31...h4 continued like this 32.a5! ... (one would like to play 32.b5 here but 32...a5 spoils the party) 32...h3  33.g3 f5 34.b5 etc.
126,4,39,3a4,b'3k4/2p2p2/K5p1/8/PP5p/8/6PP/8 b - a3',Also good was 32.Kb7
127,4,40,g5,b'3k4/2p2p2/K7/6p1/PP6/6Pp/7P/8 w - -',Diabolical cunning.  White might have been tempted to try and lame Blacks K-side by 34.g4 - normally a good policy.  But here Black would have come storming back: 34.g4? f5! 35.gxf5 g4! and suddenly Black's counterattack is looking more than merely dangerous...
128,4,41,3Kb7,b'3k4/1Kp2p2/8/6p1/PP6/6Pp/7P/8 b - -',(!) Not to be deflected.  In the last few moves Black might have tried ...Kc8 but Ka7 would have been good enough for White to win.  His pawns would have won the race easily enough: the advantage of a 2-1 majority over a 3-2...
129,4,42,3a6,b'3k4/1Kp5/P7/6p1/1P3p2/6Pp/7P/8 b - -',White is clearly winning now.  He could also have exchanged first on f4 (and 36.gxf4 g4 held no terrors for White) but White was sticking to a predetermined plan.
130,4,43,3a7,b'3k4/PKp5/8/6p1/1P6/6pp/7P/8 b - -',(!)
131,4,44,Ke7,b'Q7/1Kp1k3/8/6p1/1P6/7p/7p/8 w - -',Nor would 38...Kd7 have saved the h-pawns: 38...Kd7 39.Qc8+ K-any 40.Qxc7+ ... 41.Qxh2.
132,4,45,4Qe4+,b'8/2K1k3/8/8/1P2Q1p1/7p/7p/8 b - -',An alternative plan was to use this Queen to stymie the pawns (40.Qh1 g3) and shove the other pawn home.  But the plan White has adopted by this move is very precise.  Black is being offered not a shred of counterplay.
133,4,46,4Qg3,b'8/2K5/5k2/8/1P4p1/6Qp/8/8 b - -',Black tosses in the sponge.  1-0.

This is my return game with Coach Ion as black in the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack.  In this game I achieved only my second High Draw against him.  Between the two draws I have had some really bad games including the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack as White in which I blundered a piece after walking into a pin and never recovered.  Also that game Pipped at the Post was only a pretence of a contest although Ion got his checkmate in first I was never really in that game.  Then there was this shocker - I think Be6 was the loser - I followed the database and I think that that move should be given the skull and crossbones http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13392792&fb=1&rnd=0.7322375019235583 - do you the Jury agree on that one?

142,5,8,Qf8,b'r4qk1/pp1n2bp/6p1/2pP4/8/2N2Q2/PP4PP/R1B4K w - -',18. ...... Qf8 - a lot has been going on over the last few moves one pair of minor pieces has been traded and I now offer a queen trade.  Ion chooses to put his bishop in the way.

I also have Rf8 in mind but I got impatient and played Be5 first.  Maybe I should have played Rf8 and traded off all the major pieces after all Henry is closer to that d5 pawn that Ion's king.

Thankfully that is as far as that pawn ever gets.  I did think Ion would play Re7 but then I can play Rf7 because Henry can recapture towards the passed pawn and if I get checked on the back rank back goes my rook.

159,5,25,Rf8,b'5r2/3n2k1/pp1P2p1/2p3P1/4N3/1P2K3/P2R4/8 w - -',42. ...... Rf8 - back goes my rook onto the f column to avoid letting Ion take control of the f column.  Should Ion put his rook on the h column my rook is also gonna go there.
160,5,26,4Nc3,b'5r2/3n2k1/pp1P2p1/2p3P1/8/1PN1K3/P2R4/8 b - -',43. Nc3 - a retreat does Ion have something up his sleeve?

162,5,28,4Rd5,b'8/3n2k1/pp1P2p1/2pR1rP1/8/1PN1K3/P7/8 b - -',44. Rd5! - Ion knows just how much I lurve exchanges.  Luckily I smell a rat.  If Rxd5 then 45. Nxd5 Kf7 46. Kd5 Ke6 and now 47. Nf4+.  Either Henry must defend the pawn on g6 allowing Ion's king to make a decisive penetration on my queenside or I must take the d6 pawn and allow a passer on the g column.  Either way I will be letting Ion's king become a bull in a china shop on my queenside.  So I play the seemingly passive Rf8 and hold out the olive branch.  I half expected a refusal given the rating differential and the fact that I have played badly against him in the matches between the two draws against him.  Ion did not refuse and so at least I only had to wait five matches before getting my second draw against him - the first one took 14 games to achieve so maybe some encouraging signs are just around the corner as I strive to regain my Class A status.  Well I will worry about that later and toast the here and the now!
163,5,29,4Rf8,b'5r2/3n2k1/pp1P2p1/2pR2P1/8/1PN1K3/P7/8 w - -',44. ..... Rf8 - Ion you played really well and you did nothing wrong.  I think though that I have been threatening to do this to you and Master Freddy for a long long time but not quite succeeded.  Thankfully I allowed no silly tactics in this game and so I gave you nothing and you had to settle for a Low Draw.  Better luck next time - Joanne.

This is the third game in the sacrifices theme.  This is a team game.  I got paired up against an opponent nearly 40 points north of my rating.  All seemed lost in the middlegame when I blundered a pawn due to a tactical oversight.  I think this is the only the second time on gameknot I have blundered a pawn to a higher rated opponent and lived to tell the tale the other was my first ever Master Draw.  So how did all this happen well read on."

Nxd5 - sometimes the advanced d pawn drops off directly with Qxd5 but then the queen can be a target in the centre in the opening.  However it is playable and the queen usually lands on a5.  Jiri decided that it was more prudent to develop a knight.

178,6,14,2Bxb7,b'5rk1/pBp2ppp/4p3/2P5/3n4/1P5P/P4RP1/6K1 b - -',25. Bxb7 - a lot has happened over the past 4 moves.  Firstly the queens have been traded and now one pair of rooks.  Fou Leblanc now busts up Jiri's queenside but I must worry about that 4 - 2 kingside majority that Jiri has.  He already has a passer on the e column.

183,6,19,3Rd2,b'5r1k/p6p/2p5/2P2pp1/2Bnp3/1P5P/P2R1KP1/8 b - -',31. Rd2 - now if Rd8? protecting the knight then Ke3 will win back a pawn if f4+.  So he moves the knight to b5.
184,6,20,cxb5,b'5r1k/p6p/8/1pP2pp1/4p3/1P5P/P2R1KP1/8 w - -',32. ...... cxb5 - I have got rid of the knight and now my rook has a whole open d column to control.  Although I remain a pawn to the bad my position has improved and I have a passer on c5 to boot.
185,6,21,3b4,b'5r1k/p6p/8/1pP2pp1/1P2p3/7P/P2R1KP1/8 b - -',33. b4 - and I support the passer with b4.
186,6,22,3Kg7,b'5r2/p5kp/8/1pP2pp1/1P2p3/7P/P2R1KP1/8 w - -',33. ..... Kg7?! - here is the speculative sac - returning a pawn.  He wants to get his king into play but he will have to return a pawn.
187,6,23,Kf6,b'5r2/p2R3p/5k2/1pP2pp1/1P2p3/7P/P4KP1/8 w - -',34. ...... Kf6 - note if Rf7?? then 35. c6! followed by Rxf7 and then Glenda will appear on c8.  If the rook takes on d7 on move 35 then the pawn recaptures and Glenda appears next move on d8.  Jiri does not fall into this trap and wisely advances his king to f6.
188,6,24,3Rxa7,b'5r2/R6p/5k2/1pP2pp1/1P2p3/7P/P4KP1/8 b - -',35. Rxa7 - I was spoilt for choice but I decided to counter with a 3-1 majority on the queenside.  Was the alternative capture better?  You the jury decide.
189,6,25,3Ke2,b'3r4/R6p/5k2/1pP2pp1/1P2p3/7P/P3K1P1/8 b - -',36. Ke2 - Henry must stop Rd2+.
190,6,26,3Rxa4,b'3r4/8/5k2/2P2ppp/RP2p3/7P/4K1P1/8 b - -',38. Rxa4 - I now have two connected passed pawns on the b and c column but what will the BR and the BK do?  I'm about to find out.
191,6,27,3Rc8,b'2r5/8/5k2/2P2ppp/RP2p3/7P/4K1P1/8 w - -',38. ...... Rc8 - this move holds up the c pawn quite nicely.  If the black king were on g6 and not f6 I may well have had this game in the bag.  My rook must now use up a couple of tempi to protect the passers from the rear - always the best place for your rook when you have passed pawns - defend from behind and not from in front or the side.  Rooks need three things mobility mobility and mobility!
192,6,28,Kd5,b'2r5/8/8/2Pk1ppp/1P2p3/7P/4K1P1/2R5 w - -',40. ...... Kd5 - my pawns can go no further but can Jiri's?
193,6,29,hxg4,b'2r5/8/8/2Pk1p2/1P2p1p1/8/3K2P1/2R5 w - -',42. ..... hxg4 - at least the three to one majority on the kingside is close enough for Henry to contain.  Note that if Jiri's king moves onto the fourth rank or one square away from my c pawn it will advance!
194,6,30,4Ke3,b'2r5/8/8/2Pk1p2/1P2p1p1/4K3/6P1/2R5 b - -',43. Ke3 - and draw offer.  I did not think that either side could make progress with our respective pawns.  My opponent agreed and accepted the draw offer so I came out of this with a High Draw and one rating point wheew!  Do you think that Jiri's return pawn sacrifice was sound or do you have any other alternatives for him.  You the Inquest Jury decide.

269,10,26,g4,b'1r3nk1/R6p/5B2/2PP4/4P1p1/6P1/5PKP/8 w - -',Black just doesn't have many moves. The Rook cannot interfere with the coming mate. The best move is probably 33. ... h6 which loses more slowly to 34. Rg7+ Kh8 35. Rb7+ Kg7 36. Rxb8

Bb6 and White captures the a pawn - I think this should give white a convincing advantage due to the nature of the passed pawn on the Queenside. Black can't even capture at Bxh2 because White plays g3 and traps the bishop.

460,20,14,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Closing the e-file and preparing to castle.

462,20,16,cxd5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The symmetrical recapture doesn't promise White anything.

464,20,18,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Finally my King is safe. Somewhat... Black can still use tricks on the a7-g1 diagonal.
465,20,19,1Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This is why Black is happy to exchange the lsb early on his pieces would have a bad case of claustrophobia.
466,20,20,1Re1,b'r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I was just following theory at this point. The aim of this move is to prepare e5.
467,20,21,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Black does the same but his goal is the opposite to prevent me from achieving my desired pawn thrust. This move is also safer now that my Rook has left the f-file and f7 isn't under any kind of potential attack.
468,20,22,1h3,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Gaining the Bishop pair and over-defending e4. The problem is that without the King's Knight the e5 push won't have as much strength.
469,20,23,1Bxf3,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N2b1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Forced but Black was more than willing to go through with this exchange. Now he can focus on other things like getting his Q-side pawns rolling and generate pressure there.
470,20,24,1Bxf3,b'r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N2B1P/PP4P1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',If I would have had the time I would have loved to play Bf1 and keep this Bishop covering c4 and d3. It is much more less active of f3.
471,20,25,1Qa5,b'r3r1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/q1pP4/4PP2/2N2B1P/PP4P1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',With my Bishop stranded on f3 Black has a much easier time pushing b5 than in normal lines. I'd say he has equalized here.
472,20,26,1Be3,b'r3r1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/q1pP4/4PP2/2N1BB1P/PP4P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',I wasn't very happy with this move mainly since there isn't much point behind it. This Bishop is usually kept on c1 when f4 is played at least until White manages to push either e5 or f5. It's kinda loose on e3.
473,20,27,1b5,b'r3r1k1/p2n1pbp/3p1np1/qppP4/4PP2/2N1BB1P/PP4P1/R2QR1K1 w - b6',Black is always happy to play this since he can control c4 and d3 now and can start shuffling pieces on the Q-side to attack my pawns. In many a line this pawn is swapped tactically for White's e-pawn giving Black an easy game. Also note that Black hasn't wasted time with a6 which means that there will be fewer pawn exchanges and that that pawn will be slightly less weaker in the endgame.
474,20,28,1a3,b'r3r1k1/p2n1pbp/3p1np1/qppP4/4PP2/P1N1BB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',A pretty meager reply. I've taken care of the direct b4 threat but now c4 will be chronically weak along with all the white squares on my Q-side.
475,20,29,1Nb6,b'r3r1k1/p4pbp/1n1p1np1/qppP4/4PP2/P1N1BB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 w - -',The strategic reply to my last move. Since I don't have any direct control over c4 Black sends his Knight to that square. The only drawback is that e5 has lost of one its protectors.
476,20,30,1e5,b'r3r1k1/p4pbp/1n1p1np1/qppPP3/5P2/P1N1BB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',A flank attack is best countered by a strike in the center. Black allowed e5 but it isn't so bleak he has managed to created enough resources for counterplay. It's worth noting that more slow replies like 16. Qe2 would have quickly lost the initiative since Black would have had time to regain control of e5 and start operations on the Q-side with 16...Nfd7 followed by Rab8 and Nc4 with a very good game.
477,20,31,1Nc4,b'r3r1k1/p4pbp/3p1np1/qppPP3/2n2P2/P1N1BB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Remember what I was saying about the Be3? The Nc4 is ideally placed to take care of many problems it defends d6 and e5 it attacks e3 and b2. The alternative variation 16...dxe5 17. fxe5 Rxe5 18. Bxc5 Nfd7 19. Bb4 Qa6 20. b3 would have Black lacking coordination between his forces which are almost cut in half by my d-pawn.
478,20,32,1exf6,b'r3r1k1/p4pbp/3p1Pp1/qppP4/2n2P2/P1N1BB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 b - -',This tactical line wins me two pieces for a Rook and pawn but Black has enough prospects on both flanks to secure a balanced game.
479,20,33,1Nxe3,b'r3r1k1/p4pbp/3p1Pp1/qppP4/5P2/P1N1nB1P/1P4P1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Lines like 17...Bxf6 18. Bd2 Nxb2 19. Ne4 Bd4+ 20. Kh1 Rxe4 21. Bxa5 Nxd1 22. Raxd1 Rxf4 23. Bd2 are needlessly hectic and not very good for Black.

His Rook pair is in complete control of the e-file his King is safer than mine and he still has a menacing Q-side pawn majority. But I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
481,20,35,2f5,b'4r1k1/p4pPp/3p2p1/qppP1P2/8/P1N1rB1P/1P4P1/R2Q2K1 b - -',Inviting Black to win my Queen for his active Rooks with 21...Re1+ 22. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 23. Rxe1 gxf5 when Black has a lot of pawns and a lonely Queen against my small but more than adequate army. An ending such as this can only be dangerous for Black.
482,20,36,2a6,b'4r1k1/5pPp/p2p2p1/qppP1P2/8/P1N1rB1P/1P4P1/R2Q2K1 w - -',Black replies very coolly ignoring the apparent material gain and consolidates his pawn phalanx. He's not ready to push the pawns and is waiting for me to decide where I place my Queen.
483,20,37,2Qc2,b'4r1k1/5pPp/p2p2p1/qppP1P2/8/P1N1rB1P/1PQ3P1/R5K1 b - -',Here I missed my chance to go for the Black squares around the Black King with 21. Qd2! After a possible continuation 21...Qd8 22. Rf1 Kxg7 23. Bg4 R8e5 24. f6! and I'm the one who's on the attack. After my chosen move Black is faced with considerable less problems.
484,20,38,2Qd8,b'3qr1k1/5pPp/p2p2p1/1ppP1P2/8/P1N1rB1P/1PQ3P1/R5K1 w - -',The Queen wasn't doing much on a5 and now that b5 is defended it's time to send her to the other flank.
485,20,39,2fxg6,b'3qr1k1/5pPp/p2p2P1/1ppP4/8/P1N1rB1P/1PQ3P1/R5K1 b - -',This wasn't an immediate necessity and could have been postponed for a few more moves. The release of tension only eases Black's choices in what follows.
486,20,40,2Rf1,b'3qr1k1/5pP1/p2p2p1/1ppP4/8/P1N1rB1P/1PQ3P1/5RK1 b - -',The f-file is my only source of counterplay but thanks to my hasty pawn exchange Black has a good rebuke to my plan.

488,20,42,2Nd1,b'4r1k1/5pP1/p2p2p1/1ppP4/7q/P3rB1P/1PQ3P1/3N1RK1 b - -',Recycling the Knight and sending it for more endeavors on the other flank.

492,20,46,2b3,b'4r1k1/6P1/p2p2p1/1ppPrp2/7q/PPQ2B1P/6P1/3N1RK1 b - -',Seeing as things have stalled on the K-side at least for me I turn my attention to the other flank but I don't have high hopes of accomplishing anything without my opponents assistance.
493,20,47,2Kxg7,b'4r3/6k1/p2p2p1/1ppPrp2/7q/PPQ2B1P/6P1/3N1RK1 w - -',Black can stand the tension no longer and finally gobbles the g-pawn.
494,20,48,2Nf2,b'4r3/6k1/p2p2p1/1ppPrp2/7q/PPQ2B1P/5NP1/5RK1 b - -',A very risky decision but I couldn't stand my passive Knight any longer.
495,20,49,2Qf6,b'4r3/6k1/p2p1qp1/1ppPrp2/8/PPQ2B1P/5NP1/5RK1 w - -',Breaks the pin and aims the Rook at the third rank.

497,20,51,2Re5e3,b'4r3/6k1/p2p1qp1/QppP1p2/8/PP2rB1P/5NP1/5RK1 w - -',Very justly played. With my Queen loitering on the edge of the board all Black needs to do is mass his pieces around my King and winning should only be a matter of time.

501,20,55,3Be2,b'4r3/6k1/Q2p1qp1/2pP1p2/Pp6/1r5P/4BNP1/5RK1 b - -',I wanted to be able to defend my a-pawn in case Black would decide to attack it but that would mean one less defender on the K-side. Black is very close to winning here.
502,20,56,3Qd8,b'3qr3/6k1/Q2p2p1/2pP1p2/Pp6/1r5P/4BNP1/5RK1 w - -',I don't like this move at all and I can't find a decent reason behind it. I guess Black was concerned about me pushing a5 but that pawn is almost smelling like dead meat. 31...Rb2! would have consolidated Black advantage and all that Black would have to do to win is trade Queens.
503,20,57,3Bb5,b'3qr3/6k1/Q2p2p1/1BpP1p2/Pp6/1r5P/5NP1/5RK1 b - -',Defending the a-pawn.

505,20,59,3Nd3,b'3q4/6k1/Q2p2p1/1BpP1p2/Pp6/1r1Nr2P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',I finally get a route for a decent spot e6 but by now it's too late. Black is active enough to force a perpetual.

The game was certainly very interesting and though a draw should have been a fair result we were both clearly playing for the win.

If i play d6 then he could play Bg5 or take the pawn on d4 and i have a weakness and i am still no closer to castling and his attacking potential increases and i am going to be in trouble very quickly.

I missed a chance late on in the endgame to nail my opponent.  This was by means of a sacrifice namely a backward pawn.  I did not consider the sacrifice because I was worried about giving my opponent a passed pawn so I completely dismissed the idea.  I should have looked a little further into it before doing this as I found out from Coach Ion in a post-match feedback.  I will start the commentary on move 6 since in this Tournament 5.

I thought that the f3 pawn could be potentially dangerous and my g pawn vulnerable to capture from the black king should Henry try and win the queenside pawns.

If Henry tried to get through on the bottom half of the board the lsb could cut him off via the b1-h7 diagonal.  If Henry tried to go over the top then the BK could cut him off by moving onto d6 or d7 hence the draw offer.  I could have played on as my opponent's rating was south of mine but as black I got canned by him in the MT and he has been on a roll lately with a draw against a certain Expert.  So I did expect him to find the correct defense.  Ah well c'est la vie.  Time to study pawn breaks methinks.  Anyhow well played Michael.

The pawn would have a rook behind my queen could come back to b2 in case she needs to defend. But I don't need to defend remember?

I can't take back with the king because of 30...Qf4+ which wins my rook. Um okay I didn't see that one when I played 29. f3. But what's the big deal. I'll put the king in the corner and Black won't get anywhere.

Let's see I gotta stop his queen from going to e3 and g1 to defend against mate. Alright no problem. Put the rook on d1. Once my knight moves out of the way the rook will be guarding g1. My rook in turn can be guarded by a knight on c3. And I can always bring back the queen. I'm golden.

I had already won the game earlier so how could I possibly be facing defeat now? But when looking at all my options it started to dawn on me that no matter what I do Black will bust my king wide open and mate me.

The immediate threat is Qg1# of course. And both defensive moves are insufficient.

If 33. Nc2 hxg2+ 34. Kxg2 Rg6+ and 35. Kf1 Rg1# or 35. Kh3 Qh6#
If 33. Kxh2 hxg2+ 34. Kxg2 Rg6+ and Black mates me the same way as above no matter where I go

Why did this happen? Mostly because I was in the wrong state of mind. I didn't take my opponent's threats seriously until it was too late. I learned a lot from this game and hopefully I won't make the same mistakes again."

I decided to let my opponent trade first because Glenda sneaks onto d2 ready for destination h6.  Notice that after the trade I will take the opportunity to rid myself of my backward pawn on e4 which will open up a line for Fou Leblanc through to h7 to give me more attacking options.

The pawn on f7 is pinned to the BK by my rook on f1.  Therefore Fou Leblanc steals a pawn in broad daylight.  This is the sort of thing that my two buddies Coach Ion and Untateve (Steve) have been inflicting on me.  Well it seems that I may have learned something out of those games because it is my opponent and not me on the receiving end this time!

887,37,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I don't understand why my opponent doesn't launch his pawn to e4 with a classical king pawn opening but all the better for me.
888,37,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I send out my king pawn- though d5 would have been a better choice.

895,37,8,b4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/2b1p3/1PB5/P3P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq b3',Now my opponent is after my bishop and I'm running out of places to put it where it will do good for me. It would have been better to have my bishop on e7 from the beginning instead of fooling with it while letting him create a pawn structure.
896,37,9,d5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/7n/2bpp3/1PB5/P3P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq d6',I offer the chance to trade bishops in return.

901,37,14,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb3n/3Pp3/1P6/PB2P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Now we exchange pawns...

906,37,19,1Bd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/2nb3n/3Bp3/1P6/P3PQ1P/3P1PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Undeterred I add protection to my knight to prevent: 11.Bxc6 bxc6 [or 11... Kf8 and accept the loss of a knight a pawn and the right to castle] 12. Qxc6 leading to a rook-fork and once again the loss of the right to castle.
