However a thought came to mind that Tim might have studied some of my past games.  If that's true and he saw 4.Nc3 played my opponent would know how to answer after which I'd be in worse shape.  Well I wasn't going to take chances so the idea as elyhim puts it ""Stick with what you know.""  Since I read those comments in my annotation against Jack Stockel I know what to do when he takes.  "
217,3,4,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',That is centralizing my Rook right then and there.  Not only gaining tempo but with this I win back a pawn.  And when Tim takes I'll take back and place him in check.  I'm in the long run attempting to pin his DSB since 7...Be7 will be forced.
218,3,5,Ba4,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/3n4/4R3/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ2K1 b kq -',It might appear so but I was not worried here.  I could've developed my Nb1 with the idea of exchanging.  However kenneth_fiore_3 told me that it's generally not a good idea to exchange against a stronger player just to develop.  And as noted in milly64's WTW annotation it's important to evaluate the position.  So it boils down to open v. closed positions.  But because of what Ken noted I know the difference.  And without any pawns surrounding my LSB this is indeed an open position.  Therefore it's better not to exchange.  Given that I decide that it's important to deviate by moving back.
219,3,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/3n4/4R3/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ2K1 w - -',Meanwhile Tim castles.
220,3,7,Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/3n4/8/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Despite not wanting to move the same piece more then once in the opening I remember what happened in my training game with reversion.  Since Be7 is no longer pinned he could attack with ...Bf6 or ...f6 after which he could reattack.  To avoid complications I move back.  But the idea behind this is after being safe I'll use that time to develop another piece.  
221,3,8,Nf5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/8/5n2/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',I'm not sure he played this or see the point here.  There's no threat.  So as far as I'm concerned this is a waste of tempo.  Therefore I'll use that time to continue with my development.
222,3,9,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3p1n2/B7/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - d6',Advancing a central pawn but the idea is opening up a line for his Bc8.  However there's more to this then meets the eye as he is threatening my Nc3.  Therefore his plan is to play 10...Nd4 which would cost me more time since I'd be force to retreat.  Then he'd complete his development and get a lead in center control.
223,3,10,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3p1n2/B2P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - d3',So I put a stop a to his d5.  And my idea is also to develop my Bc1 as we're about to see.
224,3,11,1c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p5/3p1n2/B2P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Getting a pawn chain which is another common theme in chess.  
225,3,12,1Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p5/3p1n2/B2P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',But that does not bother me as my development is now complete.

227,3,14,1Bb3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2p5/p2p1n2/3P4/1BN5/PPPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',So I prevent that.
228,3,15,1Bd6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p1n2/3P4/1BN5/PPPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I also did not understand the point of this move so my inference is that he was threatening to expose my King.  The idea is having to open up to prevent mate since his Bd6 is on the b8 to h2 line.  As now h2 is a potential target.
229,3,16,1Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p1n2/3P4/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Although kenneth_fiore_3 told me to forget about hope chess it's very applicable here because I'm hoping to counter the threat without any calculation.  Since this was a closed position with my DSB blocked by my Nc3 his Nf5 is worth more.  I'm hoping that he'll exchange which would be to my advantage.
230,3,17,1Qh4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p1n2/3P3q/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',But Tim played the move that I was worried about.

But that attitude is the costly mistake.  With his next move I'm now in trouble.  Best was 15.h3 to prevent what's coming.
232,3,19,1Qh3,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p1n2/3P4/1BN1B1Pq/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',As now Tim has a real threat that will prove to be overwhelming.  So 13...Bd6 was more damaging then I could've imagined.  I was calculating lines on how it appeared to be disputed but it was more important to see the big picture as emphasized by bhidragon.
233,3,20,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p1n2/3P1B2/1BN3Pq/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b - -',?? Knowing how difficult the position has become I attempt to swap off bishops.  But this loses due to his next move.  Best was 16.Bg5
234,3,21,1Nh4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2pb4/p2p4/3P1B1n/1BN3Pq/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',But Tim declines with this move because if I take he mates on g2.  I'd rather not take his Nh4 because it leaves my monarch exposed but there's no choice in this position as it's the only way to prevent mate.  And when that happens I get in worse trouble.  That's how white is dead.
235,3,22,Bxf4,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2p5/p2p4/3P1b1P/1BN4q/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',As now I looked at other options.  I asked myself what could be done to prevent mate aside from giving up my Queen.  As it turns out there's no option.  Anything else will result checkmate.
236,3,23,1Qd3,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2p5/p2p4/3P1b1P/1BNQ3q/PPP2P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',But I did not know that until his next move.  I figured that this was the only other alternative because if he takes I'll recapture the Queen.  I also calculated an outpost after 18...Qxh2+ 19.Kf1 Qh1+  But this would've happened regardless.  I had to play 18.Qf3 and accept the loss because of what's about to unfold with a mate in 4.
237,3,24,1Bxh2+,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2p5/p2p4/3P3P/1BNQ3q/PPP2P1b/R3R1K1 w - -',What came to mind though was 18...Qxh2+ after which I'd easily get out.  That's why I also figured that 18.Qd3 was the other option.  But checking this way is where that discovery started.  Yet I had no idea that mate is inevitable.
238,3,25,Qh2+,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/2p5/p2p4/3P3P/1BNQ2b1/PPP2P1q/R3R1K1 w - -',But that changed here.  Like with my loss against bhidragon I calculated what could be done.  I know that 21.Kf1 is forced but (originally) anticipated 21...Qh1+ after which I'd answer with 22.Ke2.  However I soon figured out that his next would be 21...Qxf2# which is mate.  Knowing this I resigned.  With that I learn something else which has to do with attitude adjustment.  Part of seeing the big picture is trying to see the point of every move.  In other words before this loss happened I thought a lot of Tim's moves were pointless.  But that's not true since they proved to be disastrous.  So when you don't see the point behind certain moves it's important to calculate where he or she is getting at and what they accomplish.  After which that's when one can figure what's going on in that position and the best way to respond.

So after seeing what happened in my game with nuntar I'm trying to put my coach out of his comfort zone.  By doing this I felt that Jack wasn't used to this variation.  In addition I get a nice pawn chain and place to complete my development in return.  The other idea as I learned from tipsyjourneyman and kenneth_fiore_3 is not to exchange against a stronger opponent just because you can.

I know I've been told to hold off until later but I wasn't going wait here.  The idea is centralization can also make things difficult for your opponent.  I hope I'm not overgeneralizing but I saw that in a recent GM game.  Not only that but contrary to what I said earlier with 3...d6 now's the time that I go back to mainlines to keep Jack guessing.  Aside from that the only other move that came into consideration was 8.Nd5 but I'd lose material after 8...Nxd5 9.exd5 Bxg5 10.Nxg5 Qxg5

I could allow him to double my pawns since the capture would be towards the center.  At first however 11.Nd5 was still ruled out due to the concern about the loss of material.  But then I came to my senses as now his Ra8 is en-prise.  So I play it.
327,7,13,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/2pbbppp/p2p1n2/np1Np1B1/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',This is one of the few times where Mr. Stockel and I disagree with each other.  Jack: You're in big trouble.

Don't forget that I remember the mistake I made with nuntar by forgetting to capture which would've left him in rough shape since he'd be down by a pawn and lose castling rights.  Well I did not forget about that and in return left Jack clinging as archduke_piccolo put it in our first game where I also could've taken.  But that happens here.
330,7,16,1Qxa8,b'q4rk1/2pb1ppp/p2p4/np2p1b1/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Figuring that he got something back Jack recaptured.  For a couple of minutes I was wondering what to do.
331,7,17,1Nxg5,b'q4rk1/2pb1ppp/p2p4/np2p1N1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',But I found this move since the Queen did not defend his DSB.  He overlooked and it was nothing short of the glamoma as noted because it got confused with a pawn or bishop.  Jack: Oh you had the Knight there.  Joe: The Knight is very dangerous.  Jack: Now I must figure something else out.
332,7,18,1Qd8,b'3q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p2p4/np2p1N1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',So he attacks my Ng5 in such a nasty way.  Now I'm the one that must figure something out.  I considered what appeared to be an exchange with 15.Qg4?? but saw that he'd get my Queen for free which could not be allowed.  So I find something else and not for a cheapo tactic.
333,7,19,1Qh5,b'3q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p2p4/np2p1NQ/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',As I'm threatening a checkmate.  But mate wasn't the idea for if it were this would not have been played.  Instead I'm protecting the N.  And when Jack responds I felt that his options would be limited.  The idea is playing things that he doesn't anticipate and yet I know how he'll respond and am ready for it.  In return I feel that my advantages increase which Jack implied later on in our game chat.
334,7,20,1h6,b'3q1rk1/2pb1pp1/p2p3p/np2p1NQ/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Joe: I figured that you'd play this.  Jack: What else can I do?

For I thought about what I could do prior to playing 15.Qh5  Turns out that any other move except 16.Nh3?? loses the N.  The problem with bringing the N to h3 isn't so much the exchange but when it happens my pawn structures around the K is destroyed.  That would expose the monarch and as you remember that's how I lost my last game against him.  Being ahead doesn't mean that you can compromise the safety of your monarch.  So I retreated to the best square in my books.
336,7,22,1Nc6,b'3q1rk1/2pb1pp1/p1np3p/1p2p2Q/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Bringing his Knight to a better outpost as well.

In this case the Queens are the target because as I've learned exchanging Queens especially while ahead changes the dynamics of the game in a positive way.  Yes I had the same kind of Homework with a mentor which makes me remember all to well.
338,7,24,1Nb4,b'3q1rk1/2pb1pp1/p2p3p/1p2p3/1n2P2Q/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Jack is threatening to fork both Rooks which I did not overlook yet.  Before defending against the threat however I decide liquidate once and for all.

340,7,26,1Be6,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2pb2p/1p2p3/1n2P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Yet he's still threatening to win a back a pawn.
341,7,27,2a3,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2pb2p/1p2p3/1n2P3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',So I defend whilst attacking his Nb4.  The idea being is that I'm playing as though it were an Archange line.  That's because ...Bc5 is generally played after which white plays c3 followed by d4.  If something's there which he noted in a game against Jack you attack it to gain tempo which in return allows a pawn chain.  The same thing applies here but instead c2-c3 followed by d2-d4 the plan starts here and when he retreats I'll play 21.b4 and get a similar chain.
342,7,28,Bg4,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p1np3p/1p2p3/1P2P1b1/P2P1N2/2P2PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',I'm not sure why Jack played this but I don't see the point since my Nf3 is not pinned.

344,7,30,2Nd4,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2p3p/1p2p3/1P1nP1b1/P2P4/2PN1PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',At first I wasn't sure why Jack played this and therefore also viewed it as pointless.  But this time my assessment is quite bad because in doing so I made a mistake that allows Jack to recompensate.
345,7,31,2c4,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2p3p/1p2p3/1PPnP1b1/P2P4/3N1PPP/R1R3K1 b - c3',?? Not seeing the point this where I take advantage of the opportunity to try and exchange.  But in doing so he will equalize with his next move.  As now my monarch and Rc1 will be forked allowing him to get a Rook for a Knight.  Best was to refute this bringing my monarch into the corner with 23.Kh1.  Another option was 23.Kf1 except for what might happen after 23...Be2+  That's why I think that the better alternative is having the monarch on h1.
346,7,32,bxc4,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2p3p/4p3/1Pp1P1b1/P2P4/3N1PPP/2R2K2 w - -',After my blunder however the exchange ensues.
347,7,33,2Rxc4,b'3r2k1/2p2pp1/p2p3p/4p3/1PR1P1b1/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 b - -',But in this position however I had a hard time deciding how to take back.  That is whether to recapture with the Rook or d3.  In fact 26.dxc4 was almost played in order to keep three pawns closer together to make a stronger pawn chain.  But the reason I captured here is because of the fact that I'm now threatening his c7 whereas after the other way this wouldn't happen.  And after Jack defends I will have another threat.
348,7,34,2Rc6,b'2r3k1/2p2pp1/p1Rp3p/4p3/1P2P1b1/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 b - -',With that being said this was also part of the plan behind taking back with the Rook.  As now I will take.  Initially my thought process was winning back a pawn.  But as we're about to see white doesn't win anything
349,7,35,2Bd7,b'2r3k1/2pb1pp1/p1Rp3p/4p3/1P2P3/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 w - -',My inference is that Jack is trying to scare so that I don't find the right move.  He's probably hoping that I'll retreat back e.g. to c3 or c2.
350,7,36,2Rxa6,b'2r3k1/2pb1pp1/R2p3p/4p3/1P2P3/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 b - -',But it does not work against me as I was going to take one way or another.
351,7,37,2Bb5,b'2r3k1/2p2pp1/R2p3p/1b2p3/1P2P3/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 w - -',This however is where I discovered that my thought process.  With this fork he is going to recapture.
352,7,38,2Ra5,b'2r3k1/2p2pp1/3p3p/Rb2p3/1P2P3/P2P4/3N1PPP/5K2 b - -',Knowing this I attack his Bb5 but for the thrills and giggles here because my Rook needed to be protected.  And there's no way to defend d3 anyhow so one move is as good or bad as another with the R.
353,7,39,3Ke1,b'2r3k1/2p2pp1/3p3p/R3p3/1P2P3/P2b4/3N1PPP/4K3 b - -',I had a difficult time deciding between 30.Ke1 and 30.Kg1 in this position.  I almost moved my monarch to g1 with the idea of bringing it into the corner as noted earlier.  The reason for playing this is the fact that we've now reached an endgame.  And during that phase the monarch is a powerful.  So the idea is to keep as mobile as possible.
354,7,40,3f6,b'2r3k1/2p3p1/3p1p1p/R3p3/1P2P3/P2b4/3N1PPP/4K3 w - -',I don't know why he played this.
355,7,41,3Rd5,b'2r3k1/2p3p1/3p1p1p/3Rp3/1P2P3/P2b4/3N1PPP/4K3 b - -',31.f3 was almost played to get a different pawn chain.  However I wanted to put pressure right on his Bd3 knowing that the usual escape route (whilst attacking the Rook) with 31...Bc4?? won't work due to my Nd2.  So the idea of making things difficult for my coach remains the same.
356,7,42,3Ba6,b'2r3k1/2p3p1/b2p1p1p/3Rp3/1P2P3/P7/3N1PPP/4K3 w - -',I had anticipated 31...Bc2 where his Bishop would not get reattacked.
357,7,43,3Ra5,b'2r3k1/2p3p1/b2p1p1p/R3p3/1P2P3/P7/3N1PPP/4K3 b - -',"Believe it or not I played 32.Nf3? here because of what GM Susan Polgar taught me about a better placement for the Knight.  But Jack Stockel accurately pointed out that this is a blunder because I'd lose a pawn after 32...Bb7 without compensation.  Therefore he made me find a better move as Homework.  This is similar to what a mentor did by giving me HW when mentioning a move which I remembered to give my students Homework.  And it's also similar to what kenneth_fiore_3 when we talked about the possibility of getting training from him before it got busy.  What Ken said is that there are times where he will not allow the student to make a move if it's an error.  Well the same thing is true here because Jack was not going to allow me to make that mistake.  Therefore I found this move and he said ""Very good move!  That's much better.""  But this move will result with the same response as he also outlined.  On the other hand it doesn't lose material."
358,7,44,3f3,b'2r3k1/1bp3p1/3p1p1p/R3p3/1P2P3/P4P2/3N2PP/4K3 b - -',However I decide to add a defender to e4 so that I can move my Nd2 to a better outpost without the loss of material.
359,7,45,3Kf7,b'2r5/1bp2kp1/3p1p1p/R3p3/1P2P3/P4P2/3N2PP/4K3 w - -',As noted earlier the King plays a powerful role in the endgame.
360,7,46,3Nc4,b'2r5/1bp2kp1/3p1p1p/R3p3/1PN1P3/P4P2/6PP/4K3 b - -',"Also mentioned is that my Knight is better placed.  Jack said ""You moved the Knight.  That is a good move."""
361,7,47,3g5,b'2r5/1bp2k2/3p1p1p/R3p1p1/1PN1P3/P4P2/6PP/4K3 w - g6',Advancing his g7.  The idea being is that by playing this his pawns are better connected which is also critical at this phase.
362,7,48,3Kf2,b'2r5/1bp2k2/3p1p1p/R3p1p1/1PN1P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 b - -',Like what we saw with Jack I get to it by mobilizing my monarch.  The long term plan however is to get the opposition.  We're not at that phase yet since so many pawns obstruct the monarch but the idea is getting towards that phase.
363,7,49,3h5,b'2r5/1bp2k2/3p1p2/R3p1pp/1PN1P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 w - -',Advancing his h pawn.  Now if it can go to h4 this chain will become very dangerous.
364,7,50,3Ra7,b'2r5/Rbp2k2/3p1p2/4p1pp/1PN1P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 b - -',"But before he can do I hit Bb7.  Then Jack said ""Nothing is good right now.""  What he was alluding is for black."
365,7,51,3d5,b'2r5/Rbp2k2/5p2/3pp1pp/1PN1P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 w - -',"""This is the best"" as he also said."
366,7,52,3Na5,b'2r5/Rbp2k2/5p2/N2pp1pp/1P2P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 b - -',I considered exchanging his Bb7 for my Knight.  But my N can do a lot here.  More importantly (the reason for this decision) is that exchanging means that Jack would have passed pawn right away.  That's because his d5 would keep advancing and it would be unstoppable.  By playing this however that's not true any longer.  Even if he plays ...d5 I'll answer with Ke2 and black can't place me in check due to my Ra7.
367,7,53,3Ba8,b'b1r5/R1p2k2/5p2/N2pp1pp/1P2P3/P4P2/5KPP/8 w - -',Since I denied that exchanged Jack wisely retreats because anything else loses the Bishop.  With that being said another reason for playing 37.Na5 was to prevent him from responding with ...Bc6 as now it's confined.  Although it's an endgame the idea is to still leave black with a cramped position.
368,7,54,3exd5,b'b1r5/R1p2k2/5p2/N2Pp1pp/1P6/P4P2/5KPP/8 b - -',Now how dangerous that pawn can be I take to prevent that from happening.
369,7,55,3Bxd5,b'2r5/R1p2k2/5p2/N2bp1pp/1P6/P4P2/5KPP/8 w - -',As expected he takes back.
370,7,56,3Ke3,b'2r5/R1p2k2/5p2/N2bp1pp/1P6/P3KP2/6PP/8 b - -',This time the plan is to get the opposition.  This involves exchanging more pawns as a long term plan though so that nothing interferes with the King's being opposite of one another.  And I remember what Susan told me that this opposition is vital in endgames.  The other idea is for something else which is important called triangulation (where the King moves in a triangle).  But that will happen right after his next move.
371,7,57,3Kg6,b'2r5/R1p5/5pk1/N2bp1pp/1P6/P3KP2/6PP/8 w - -',Unpinning his c pawn.
372,7,58,4Kd3,b'2r5/R1p5/5pk1/N2bp1pp/1P6/P2K1P2/6PP/8 b - -',So I take advantage of the opportunity to do the triangulation.
373,7,59,4g4,b'2r5/R1p5/5pk1/N2bp2p/1P4p1/P2K1P2/6PP/8 w - -',And he attempts to exchange pawns which I accept due to the plan of getting the distant opposition.  However that is a mistake because he is going to win a pawn without compensation.  Better is 41.Ke3 or 41.Ke2 adding another defender to f3.
374,7,60,4g3,b'2r5/R1p5/5pk1/N2bp3/1P4p1/P2K2P1/7P/8 b - -',Protecting g2 whilst preventing his g4 from advancing any further for now.
375,7,61,4c6,b'2r5/R7/2p2pk1/N2bp3/1P4p1/P2K2P1/7P/8 w - -',I'm not exactly sure why he played this but my guess is to do damage with his c6.
376,7,62,4Rd7,b'2r5/3R4/2p2pk1/N2bp3/1P4p1/P2K2P1/7P/8 b - -',In this position I reversed the colors and thought that his Bishop was pinned.  It's because I mixed up my King with his thinking that his monarch was on this square.  This still remains a weakness for me.  Doing this is not a good way to go though and has led to me giving some of students the wrong information in their annotations.  In fact that's why it often happened.  But it's worse here as this is where I'll start to go wrong believe it or not.
377,7,63,4Rh8,b'7r/3R4/2p2pk1/N2bp3/1P4p1/P2K2P1/7P/8 w - -',As noted Jack is going to pick up a pawn.
378,7,64,4a4,b'7r/3R4/2p2pk1/N2bp3/PP4p1/3K2P1/7P/8 b - -',The idea here is to get pawn chain followed by an exchange.  That's because my goal is to get a passed pawn.  But I felt that it does not work since his pieces appear coordinate here. 
379,7,65,4Rd6,b'8/8/2pR1pk1/N2bp3/PP4p1/3K2P1/7r/8 b - -',But before advancing my a4 further I decide to pin his f6 first.
380,7,66,4Ra2,b'8/8/2pR1pk1/N2bp3/PP4p1/3K2P1/r7/8 w - -',However he is still going to win my a4 one way or another.  With best play I might be able to draw as Jack told me later on.  This happened after this game seconds before we said goodbye.  That's because when we were finished my coach showed me a different position with a student as to why it's not lost.  Right after we put things away just before leaving he told me what happened.
381,7,67,4Nxc6,b'8/8/2NR1pk1/3bp3/PP4p1/3K2P1/r7/8 b - -',?? With that being said this is where reversing the colors becomes the costly error.  I figured that he's going to get my a4 but in return I've won a piece since it appeared that his Bd5 was pinned.  As noted I mixed up his monarch for mine.
382,7,68,4Bxc6,b'8/8/2bR1pk1/4p3/PP4p1/3K2P1/r7/8 w - -',Due to that weakness I thought that this was unplayable.  Joe: This is an illegal move.  Jack: How is this illegal?  After which I looked at it and said that he was right.  But the game is now lost for white as he implied.  During our chat Jack said that instead of exchanging Knight for Bishop much better was to wait and later on sac the Knight for a pawn.  By playing this he will get a passed pawn which will become impossible to stop.  The idea being is that in an endgame like this the Knight can stop a pushed pawn from doing damage.  Eliminating it early on takes away that opportunity enabling him to get a passer which will promote.
383,7,69,Rxa4,b'8/8/2R2pk1/4p3/rP4p1/3K2P1/8/8 w - -',As anticipated he takes.  But this also blends in with what he was saying because of the fact that I have two isolated pawns against three of his connected pawns.  To of them are in a chain
384,7,70,4b5,b'8/8/2R2pk1/1P2p3/r5p1/3K2P1/8/8 b - -',So I do what I can to prevent further damage.
385,7,71,4Ra3+,b'8/8/2R2pk1/1P2p3/6p1/r2K2P1/8/8 w - -',But it's too little too late because he will pick up another pawn with this fork.  Little did I realize that when he does he'll have another passer.  And this is the one that will do the damage.  At this point however I figured out that I'm lost.  Although I'd normally resign resignation is not an option yet.  That's due to the fact that since this is a WTW game (which will be posted in that club and the fact that I have a little more time then usual 30 instead of 5-10 minutes I'll follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules.  It states that we don't resign until you see a forced a mating sequence.)
386,7,72,5Kd5,b'8/8/2R2pk1/1P1Kp3/6p1/6r1/8/8 b - -',Doing what I can I decide to stop his e pawn from advancing.
387,7,73,5Kf5,b'8/8/2R2p2/1P1Kpk2/6p1/6r1/8/8 w - -',But he now has the opposition which is going to enable him to push e5 since I can no longer stop it.
388,7,74,5Kd6,b'8/8/2RK1p2/1P2pk2/6p1/6r1/8/8 b - -',So I try to come up with another idea.  The idea is to counterattack if he plays 51...Kf5 for I'd respond with 52.Ke6.  Not to my surprise though it doesn't happen.
389,7,75,5Rb3,b'8/8/2RK1p2/1P2pk2/6p1/1r6/8/8 w - -',Instead he goes after my b5.
390,7,76,5b6,b'8/8/1PRK1p2/4pk2/6p1/1r6/8/8 b - -',Which I thought could be protected with this move.  But Jack's got something else up his sleeve.
391,7,77,5g3,b'8/8/1PRK1p2/4pk2/8/1r4p1/8/8 w - -',"It's with this pawn as it's a matter of time before it Queens.  As the saying goes ""passed pawns must be pushed."""
392,7,78,5Ke7,b'8/4K3/1PR2p2/4pk2/8/1r4p1/8/8 b - -',Doing whatever possible I attempt to centralize my monarch.  That's because I still remember about mating with just two bishops and the king.  And when you're on the other end of it (so they have the mate) the way to last longer is by centralization of the monarch.  The reason it appeared to apply here is that I thought we were similar territory.  Knowing that he'll Queen with a similar position the idea was applying what I've learned.  But it does not apply however in this position.  That's because it's even worse then I imagined and out found that I don't last longer after his next move.
393,7,79,5g2,b'8/4K3/1PR2p2/4pk2/8/1r6/6p1/8 w - -',At this point Jack told me that the position was resignable as usual.  But with 20-25 minutes as opposed to less time I refused.  In it I admitted to being lost but resignation was not an option yet.  Now he know's that I have a computer and annotate my games against him since I've told him.  But I just told Mr. Stockel that I'm in a club and they have a rule of not resigning until mate is forced.  And I was going to abide by.  For those that are wondering the only time I don't is when time management is an issue (meaning: that I'm almost out of time.  Otherwise I don't.)
394,7,80,5Rxf6+,b'8/4K3/1P3R2/4pk2/8/1r6/6p1/8 b - -',So I take knowing that he can't back.
395,7,81,5Kg5,b'8/4K3/1P3R2/4p1k1/8/1r6/6p1/8 w - -',I don't know why he played this.
396,7,82,5Rf7,b'8/4KR2/1P6/4p1k1/8/1r6/6p1/8 b - -',? But I prepare for when he promotes.  However similar to what we saw when continuing a different game with my coach after premature resignation I made the same mistake.  By playing this he is going to win another pawn.  Instead my Rook had to remain on the sixth where b6 was protected.  Therefore just about anything else was better then the move played.  Another way of putting is what charleshiggies said in one of his annotations that this is a mistake in a lost position.
397,7,83,5Rg7+,b'8/4K1R1/1r6/4p1k1/8/8/6p1/8 b - -',Without anything much better I decide to place him in check.  This time it is just for the thrills and giggles of it since there didn't appear to be anything to lose.  My thought was delaying the promotion for as long as possible since the it appeared that the only way to get out was with the monarch.  But I overlooked his next move.
398,7,84,5Kf7,b'8/5KR1/6r1/4p1k1/8/8/6p1/8 b - -',? So I try to get his Rook in return.  But this is another mistake as he will liquidate.  Afterwhich I can resign soon after since I'll only be left the monarch.  Much better was 57.Rh7 or 57.Rf7 where this exchange would not have been possible.  And now if he promotes even with a Rook I'd still have mine and might be able to hold off against mate.  Consequently that would further delay my resignation.
399,7,85,g1=Q,b'8/6K1/8/4p1k1/8/8/8/6q1 w - -',Right after the promotion I resigned.  With only my monarch against his Queen and King (even without the pawn) mate is forced.  That is due to what I remember on how to mate with your Knight and Bishop since I studied this for several months until it became second nature.  Well the same concept applies here because he will force my monarch into the corner (this time h8 where mate would be forced.)  Therefore it blends right in with the rules mentioned earlier of not resigning until mate is inevitable.  With that being said my next move would be 59.Kf7.  After that a likely continuation would be 59...Qd4 60.Ke6 Kg6 61.Ke7 Kf5 62.Kf7 Qd7+ 63.Kf8 Kf6 64.Kg8 Qf7+ 65.Kh8 Qg7#  But no matter how you slice it mate is still forced one way or another.  
400,8,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Interesting opening that I rarely hear of.  In fact I don't know what it's called but 1.e4 or 1.d4 is the most common opening.  Not only that but I haven't someone fianchettoing his or her Bishop on the first move.  I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with it for indeed I don't think there is.  But what I mean is that we don't often see this opening which makes sense because the idea is for Ken to bring Andy into unfamiliar territory.  In fact I heard of a Grandmaster winning by using that strategy.
401,8,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Sticking to what he knows however.
402,8,2,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Forming a nice flank for his Bishop.  This answers the question as Ken is trying to get Andy in unfamiliar territory since the general idea is for the Knight to be developed before the Bishop.  Of course there's always exceptions but when it's this early it becomes safe to infer that something else is going.  And that other thing makes total sense which is how I came up with that conclusion.
403,8,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I haven't seen any games from Andy before but the inference is that Andy is sticking to what he knows best.
404,8,4,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Preventing his center pawn from becoming en-prise after Andy's next move.  
405,8,5,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Meanwhile Ken continues with his development.
406,8,6,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Getting a nice pawn chain in the process.
407,8,7,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3P4/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq d3',Although it has not transposed this position however rings a bell.  And that would be the Cole System's.  They're not very similar but there is a comparison with white's fianchettoed bishop on b2 pawns on e3 and d4 and black's knight on f6.  That's because the Cole's Franketort System starts off with 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 followed by 3.e3 and an eventual b3 Bb2 as white.
408,8,8,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/3Pp3/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Hitting Nf3 which is somewhat similar to what I see in the Terasch Variation of the French Defense except that it was black to who attacked.
409,8,9,Nfd2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/3Pp3/1P2P3/PBPN1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',As anticipated.  Anything else would allow Andy to get a nasty discover attack by moving his N.  After which it would at the very least get exchanged with black's bishop and result in doubled pawns which we don't want here.
410,8,10,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/3Pp3/1P2P3/PBPN1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Continuing with his development.

The reason being is that in the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense although we're reversing colors the a pawn does advance to stop the Knight from coming on the b file.  Or to prevent a Bishop check which wouldn't happen but the N swarming in is something to take caution.  I learned about this kind of tactic from GM Judit Polgar in her win against Anand before he became a world champion.     
416,8,16,a5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/2np1n2/p4b2/2PPp3/PPN1P3/1B1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ a6',But in Andy's case I don't see the point behind this move.  The thing is that I understand Ken much better then Andy so I don't view any of white's moves as pointless.  But with black however it's a very different story.  And when that happens I just don't understand what they accomplish which is what is implied by not seeing the point.
417,8,17,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/2np1n2/p4b2/2PPp3/PPN1P3/1BQN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The idea is to connect the Rooks which I like a lot.  Ken starts by mobilizing his Q side.
418,8,18,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/2n2n2/p2p1b2/2PPp3/PPN1P3/1BQN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',? Strengthening his DSB but I view it as a mistake.  Now Ken told me that there were several mistakes.  In my books this is the first one as it loses a pawn when all is said and done.  Instead I would've played 10...Bg4 so that if white were to complete his development I'd just exchange.  And I base some of this on what kenneth_fiore_3 of where I started to go wrong in my last annotation with Jack Stockel.  He said that one should not exchange against a stronger player just to develop.  When I did that things started to go downhill from then on.
419,8,19,Qd7,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/2n5/p2n1b2/3PN3/PP2P3/1BQN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Connecting his Rooks.
420,8,20,1Bd3,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/2n5/p2n1b2/3PN3/PP1BP3/1BQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Completing his development and it's important to note that if Andy did not play 10...d5? this move wouldn't have been possible.  As now the LSB is better placed.  That's another reason for viewing that move as a mistake.  Even if not I deem it worthy of a queiry.
421,8,21,1Bg6,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/2n3b1/p2n4/3PN3/PP1BP3/1BQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Not only don't I know why Andy played this but I don't see the point.
422,8,22,1Ng3,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/2n3b1/p2n4/3P4/PP1BP1N1/1BQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',But it appears that this has become a closed position despite the bishops not being blocked in by their own pawns as Ken taught me in charleshiggie's most recent annotation.  Therefore this retreats makes sense.  Afterall it's important to keep the stronger piece. 
423,8,23,1Ndb4,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/2n3b1/p7/1n1P4/PP1BP1N1/1BQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now the position becomes complicated.  In my opinion Andy sacced his N to get an open file.  But Ken however has some surprises as we're about to see.  In fact I've witnessed similar positions in GM games which shows how complex it's becoming.
424,8,24,Nxb4,b'r4rk1/1ppqbppp/6b1/p7/1n1P4/1P1BP1N1/1BQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',"That's because Ken is going to sac his Queen for a minor one.  Yet despite having the Queen just like what we see in TA's Q sac one must understand their theory as Joe emphasizes.  With that it's important to note as I learned in ""The Deeper Chess Theory Club"" that after saccing material a lot of times Joe's opponents go wrong by not understanding enough theory.  "
425,8,25,Bb4,b'r4rk1/1ppq1ppp/8/p7/1b1P4/1P2P1N1/1BBN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',In return however Andy pins the Knight.
426,8,26,1Ke2,b'r4rk1/1ppq1ppp/8/p7/1b1P4/1P2P1N1/1BBNKPPP/R6R b - -',But as it turns out that this pin isn't serious at all.  However I would've broken by castling long.  My first instincts was 18.0-0?? but that would leave d2 en-prise and enable black to get a piece.  In which case the outcome would likely be different for Ken in a negative way.  But with 18.0-0-0 the Knight is protected and the monarch appears to safer.  Because the K was brought out it leads to one inference.  What comes to mind is that this is an endgame even though it doesn't appear so.  If I'm right it makes perfect sense because the King is a dangerous weapon in that phase of the game as Jack Stockel and GM Susan Polgar have pointed out.
427,8,27,1Bxd2,b'r4rk1/1ppq1ppp/8/p7/3P4/1P2P1N1/1BBbKPPP/R6R w - -',What's even more interesting is Andy's decision to exchange.
428,8,28,c5,b'r4rk1/1p1q1ppp/8/p1p5/3P4/1P2P1N1/1BBK1PPP/R6R w - c6',I don't know why Andy played this.
429,8,29,2Bd3,b'r4rk1/1p1q1ppp/8/p1p5/3P4/1P1BP1N1/1B1K1PPP/R6R b - -',I'm also not sure why this was played but my inference is to give the monarch added protection since there's a piece in front of it.  Now I know that it's an endgame because I often see the bishop right in front of the monarch when we've reached that phase.
430,8,30,2Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/1p1q1ppp/8/p1p5/3P4/1P1BP1N1/1B1K1PPP/R6R w - -',Preparing to do some damage by centralizing his Rook.

The only idea that makes sense to me is an attempt to get a passed pawn.  Sure isn't now but if it kept advancing white's Ng3 moved followed by the g pawn advancing two pawns are connected which also makes pawn chains dangerous.  Then the f pawn adds to that and they keep advancing.  Later you exchange until one has a clear away so that it's not in front of or next to the pawn making the passed pawn.  
432,8,32,2Qd5,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p1pq4/3P3P/1P1BP1N1/1B1K1PP1/R6R w - -',The plan of course would be to prevent that.  So the idea appears to be 22...g5 23.hxg5 Qxg5 preventing a problem.
433,8,33,2e4,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p1pq4/3PP2P/1P1B2N1/1B1K1PP1/R6R b - -',But Ken puts a stop to that plan by attacking the Queen.  By doing this he's now saccing another pawn which makes it more interesting.
434,8,34,2Bc3,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p1p5/3PP2P/1qBB2N1/3K1PP1/R6R b - -',Protecting his Bishop.  But after this Andy goes for the gusto by exchanging another pawn.
435,8,35,Rad8,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/8/p7/3BP2P/1q1B2N1/3K1PP1/R6R w - -',Centralizing his other Rook whilst attacking Bd4.
436,8,36,2Ne2,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/8/p7/3BP2P/1q1B4/3KNPP1/R6R b - -',Which Ken protects.
437,8,37,2Qb4+,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/8/p7/1q1BP2P/3B4/3KNPP1/R6R w - -',It appears that for the thrills and giggles Andy delivers a check.  The reason I posted thrills and giggles is that this check does not appear to be serious so I don't see the point here.  Of course I must be missing something because more often then not things that I view as pointless are known to be very damaging.
438,8,38,2Ke3,b'3rr1k1/1p3ppp/8/p7/1q1BP2P/3BK3/4NPP1/R6R b - -',In addition I would've gotten out with 26.Bc3.  In doing so I would feel a gain of time since black must protect his Queen in which case I'd try to come up with long term plans.  Instead Andy has other ideas as he'll sac his Rook for a Bishop.  In my opinion this is unsound because it appears that Ken can do a lot of damage in this position.  I'm not exactly sure what he'll do but that's where it gets quite interesting.
439,8,39,Qc5,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p1q5/3NP2P/3BK3/5PP1/R6R w - -',Pinning the Nd4.
440,8,40,2Rhc1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p1q5/3NP2P/3BK3/5PP1/R1R5 b - -',Which Ken tries to break the pin with this attack.  
441,8,41,2Qa7,b'4r1k1/qp3ppp/8/p7/3NP2P/3BK3/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',But Andy figures out how to keep the pin anyhow.
442,8,42,2Bc4,b'4r1k1/qp3ppp/8/p7/2BNP2P/4K3/5PP1/R1R5 b - -',Pinning f7.
443,8,43,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/qp3ppp/8/p7/2BNP2P/4K3/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',Which Andy does not want.  That's because with this added attacker Andy threatens to win a piece.
444,8,44,3Bd5,b'3r2k1/qp3ppp/8/p2B4/3NP2P/4K3/5PP1/R1R5 b - -',So Ken adds another defender to protect it.
445,8,45,3b5,b'3r2k1/q4ppp/8/pp1B4/3NP2P/4K3/5PP1/R1R5 w - b6',It appears that Andy is trying to wear down's Ken position because what's kept in mind is that Ken can't take on b5 since it's pinned.  So my inference is that black is taking advantage of that to try and exploit white's position.
446,8,46,3Kd3,b'3r2k1/q4ppp/8/pp1B4/3NP2P/3K4/5PP1/R1R5 b - -',It's well known that in an endgame your monarch is a powerful weapon.  Ken is using that to his advantage.
447,8,47,3b4,b'3r2k1/q4ppp/8/p2B4/1p1NP2P/3K4/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',Getting a solid pawn chain in the process.  However Andy left himself vulnerable to a fork.  But Andy does get out of it in a surprising way that is easy to overlook.  With that what came to mind was defending with 31...Qd7 and if 32.Bc6 I'd answer with 32...Qc7.
448,8,48,Qa6+,b'3r2k1/5ppp/q1N5/p2B4/1p2P2P/3K4/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',With that being said this is how Andy responds since Ken is in check.
449,8,49,Qb6+,b'3r2k1/5ppp/1qN5/p2B4/1p2P2P/4K3/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',The idea with this check is still the same.
450,8,50,Rd6,b'6k1/5ppp/1qNr4/p2B4/1p2P2P/5K2/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',Allowing Andy to protect both.  But Ken has other idea starting with the next move.
451,8,51,Kf8,b'5k2/4Nppp/1q1r4/p2B4/1p2P2P/5K2/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',Going after the N.  In this position I most likely would've played 35...Kh8 only because Jack Stockel told me that in general bringing the monarch to the corner is part of K safety.  I recently learned however that this is not always true.  In fact despite what I said or the response I like black's his intentions better because black attempts to gain tempo in the process.
452,8,52,3Nf5,b'5k2/5ppp/1q1r4/p2B1N2/1p2P2P/5K2/5PP1/R1R5 b - -',The only problem is that white is the one that gains tempo.
453,8,53,3Rd8,b'3r1k2/5ppp/1q6/p2B1N2/1p2P2P/5K2/5PP1/R1R5 w - -',As now Andy was forced to protect his Rook.
454,8,54,3Rc6,b'3r1k2/5ppp/1qR5/p2B1N2/1p2P2P/5K2/5PP1/R7 b - -',After which Ken gains even more time with this move.
455,8,55,3Ne3,b'3r1k2/1q3ppp/2R5/p2B4/1p2P2P/4NK2/5PP1/R7 b - -',Which he uses on his visual N counts which adds up to the amount of times the Knight moves and on which squares.  The reason for mentioning this is because tactical-abyss said that this is very important and it's one of the techniques he uses in his Q sacs.  I learned a bit from that and applied it one of my games.  In that game I did not make blunders but used the N a lot and the visual count enabled me to win that game.
456,8,56,3b3,b'3r1k2/1q3ppp/2R5/p2B4/4P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/R7 w - -',"As the saying goes ""Passed pawns must be pushed."""
457,8,57,3Rb1,b'3r1k2/1q3ppp/2R5/p2B4/4P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/1R6 b - -',But Ken puts a stop to that by placing his Rook right in front of that pawn.  Now Jack Stockel made me study a position that was a little similar as Homework.  But the idea and what he taught there was that in general the way to stop a passer is by placing the Rook in front of it as we see here.
458,8,58,3a4,b'3r1k2/1q3ppp/2R5/3B4/p3P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/1R6 w - -',But this pawn chain can be a liability.  I studied a more similar example with tactical-abyss specifically on pawn chains.  Like what we see here and as mentioned there was a passer stopped by the Rook.  But what got dangerous was the other passed pawn connected to it just like here and formed a pawn chain.  It was in a video by an IM and with a pawn chain similar he was able to force a win.
459,8,59,4Rc7,b'3r1k2/1qR2ppp/8/3B4/p3P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/1R6 b - -',"?? So the idea is to diffuse the situation with a double attack.  After what Ken mentioned about both sides making mistakes this was in my books a blunder.  I don't see any threats affiliated with it so in this position I think that it's not a mistake to take here.  In other words ""To take is a mistake"" is not applicable here.  "
460,8,60,4Rd7,b'5k2/1qRr1ppp/8/3B4/p3P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/1R6 w - -',With that being said I would've played 40...Qxc7.  In fact by playing this I believe that Andy will find himself in trouble starting with Ken's the next move as white will have a series of nasty checks.
461,8,61,Ke7,b'2R5/1q1rkppp/8/3B4/p3P2P/1p2NK2/5PP1/1R6 w - -',However I think that black could've saved the game with 41...Qxc8.
462,8,62,4Ke3,b'8/1q1r1ppp/2R5/3BkN2/p3P2P/1p2K3/5PP1/1R6 b - -',Getting the opposition which is very useful in endgames. 
463,8,63,4g5,b'8/1q1r1p1p/2R5/3BkNp1/p3P2P/1p2K3/5PP1/1R6 w - g6',I'm not sure why black played this but this loses even quicker.  That's because white get's another pawn.  Instead I would've attacked with 44...g6 and after white's Nf5 drops back I'd try to figure what I can do to prevent what's coming.
464,8,64,Qxc6,b'8/3r1p1p/2q5/3BkNP1/p3P3/1p2K3/5PP1/1R6 w - -',In this position there's nothing that Andy can do so he might as well have taken the Rook.  In other words one move is as good or bad as another because Ken mates regardless.
465,8,65,4f4#,b'8/3r1p1p/2q5/3BkNP1/p3PP2/1p2K3/6P1/1R6 b - f3',And the moral is the same as what we see with TA's Q sacs/unusual openings.  Strong players can in general give up material and still win.  What's important to remember is that against formidable players like Joe and Ken one must understand their theory.  Lacking even the slightest amount of that can lead disaster.  And that's we saw in this game.
466,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here's a lucky escape against a young schoolboy who outplayed me for most of the game.  It does show the importance of hanging on in there!

470,9,4,Be3,b'rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P1B3/2P2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I still wanted to play Qg4 but felt that it would be safer if d4 was secured first.  While 6. Qg4 would have maintained defence of d4 it would only have done so if I didn't want to take g7.  Other means of over-defending d4 with Nf3 of Ne2 would of course have prevented Qg4. In retrospect I think I should have played 6. Qg4 regardless. 
471,9,5,Nd7,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P1B3/2P2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black defends c5 with a developing move though it does block in the Bc8.

A move borrowed from the Advance Variation that is inappropriate here with the Queenside already so seriously compromised.  The White King will have nowhere safe to go.  I was losing faith in the planned Qg4 by now and thinking more about bolstering the centre with 9. Nf3 to follow.

He may also have hoped to provoke g4 which I baulked at as being one pawn advance too far.  I think it would have been preferable to the mess that followed though.

The Q can't defend c3 because the Ra1 would be left undefended.  The Bf2 can no longer come to the rescue and a K move would give up hope of castling.  A rook move would not prevent the loss of c3 and would also leave a3 undefended.

I felt that this was my best hope of attaining some sort of equality as at least the pawn wouldn't be a further worry after the fall of the c3 pawn.  In fact it just invited the other N to the party.  Given the lack of attractive alternatives I can't quite dismiss this as a total blunder though.  Perhaps 11. Bd3 would have been best preparing castling but after 11...Qxc3+ Nd2 12. Ne3 would have been embarrassing.

526,10,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Standard Sicilian defense from black. This is apparently one of the most common and statistically successful defenses against e4. The strategy black has with 1..c5 is to inhibit white's ability to maintain a central pawn majority. You can see if white moves 2. d4 he will be at a 2-1 central pawn disadvantage after a quick exchange in the first two moves of the game. In addition this exchange results in the queen coming out where she will undoubtedly be harassed while black develops.
527,10,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"This is the MT starting position.

Typically white would accept the temporary disadvantage at d4 by playing 2. Nf3 (headed to the ""open Sicilian""). In my view this is a really sexy move one of my favorite opening chess moves. Nf3 allows white to develop the knight provides white control of the remaining center squares (pressured only at d4) allows for a potential d4 (or e5) push in the future and is one step closer to castling. In addition notice the scope of the white LSB and queen compared to black's. This scope difference creates delays in black development. Quite a return on investment for one move!

However if white follows 2. Nf3 d6 with 3. d4 this will again result in the exchange of a flank pawn for a central pawn albeit with development advantages.

So by countering with 2. c3 (""Alapin Sicilian"" or ""c3 Sicilian"") instead white provides the future d4 pawn a ""buddy"" to back him up. Let's call him Buddy. I'm sure the d4 pawn feels all warm inside. Buddy allows white to maintain the central pawn status quo. However with all good things there are drawbacks. The primary white weakness is the limited mobility of the queen side knight which makes the e4 pawn more vulnerable to immediate attack.

I may be missing some key elements in description but this is what I notice."
528,10,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Here black is putting additional pressure on d4 which is most certainly the early battle ground.
529,10,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',But white is undeterred and occupies d4. Two attackers two defenders the attacker loses.

532,10,7,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So black challenges the e4 pawn. I think Nf6 might have been better here to capitalize on the fact white cannot readily defend with the queen side knight AND develop a minor piece. D5 is a similar tactic but moves a pawn instead of developing a minor piece but opens a line up for the black LSB. Not really sure which is better.

Note: analysis shows we are back in book again but white has successfully avoided the c3 attack taking advantage of the white queen side knight weakness. White is in rapid development which is a key to defeating the Sicilian defense. If white can maintain rapid development the black queen side pieces will be quickly marginalized."

Black is focused on d5. The black queen is posed and salivating. I had planned on castling but I decide to use the castling move to further my attack. Therefore white really can't use the h1 rook for traditional purposes given the castle decision. It's unlikely white will be able to connect the rooks as well.

In the first game elyhim mentioned that most would argue playing d4 is done to avoid opening tactics and leads to closed equal positions. I haven't played it enough to recognize that fact yet. What I know is I win more with this opening than with e4.
645,13,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',QP moves... the thing about this game you'll notice is the action that normally happens right over center seems to be offset a bit towards the A file. Not sure if that is typical or not but I noticed it halfway through the game.

694,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual they also enjoy 1.e4.
695,14,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So Stick to my Sicilian Defense.
696,14,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As anticipated.
697,14,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I stick to mainlines.
698,14,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Last time they played 3.Bb5.  But I've seen this move once.  That was in my loss against one of my students.  The idea here is 4.Ng5 with N fork threat.
699,14,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"But they can't fool me since I've seen before.  As the saying goes ""Don't trust your opponent."""
700,14,6,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',4.Bb5+ is the move that I anticipated but they decide to get their monarch safety which is a good strategy especially when I'm behind in development and center control.
701,14,7,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',But now I play as if black had a SM in mind with 2.Bb5  My idea is exchange pawns to gain tempo.
702,14,8,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',However they're the ones that gain time.  I knew that this would be played sooner or later and was waiting for it.
703,14,9,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I base things on what reversion has told me.  And I checked out the game.  In it he said that best is ...Nd7.  Therefore the idea is to follow my instinct.
704,14,10,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',After what happened in my game against Sue I know black's evil intention.  They want me to exchange on d5 because Nf5-d4 would pose as a very dangerous threat in this position.
705,14,11,Ngf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/5n2/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I don't allow it by declining the exchange for now.
706,14,12,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/5n2/1Bpp2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile they decide to indirectly pin my N.
707,14,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/5n2/1Bpp2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Which I break in the most common way.  After which white exchanges.  I'm a little surprised because I was once told not take the Knight that's pinned to the Queen.  But it's beneficial in this position.  
708,14,14,1Re1+,b'r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/5b2/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq -',After which they place me in check.
709,14,15,1Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq -',However I still want to keep my option of castling open.  The only problem is that I have a piece tied down which gives white an advantage.
710,14,16,1Qe2,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',As noted from several annotations a Queen in front of the Rook is especially dangerous but especially in this position.  That's because white's threatening to win a piece as I saw in my game against Sue.
711,14,17,1Kf8,b'r1bq1k1r/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',Therefore castling is not an option.  Instead I need an extra defender on f8. 
712,14,18,1Nc3,b'r1bq1k1r/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Completing their development.  But now that it appears safe this is where I decide to exchange pawns.
713,14,19,Nf6,b'r1bq1k1r/pp2bppp/5n2/1B1N4/3p4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',?? Preparing to exchange Knights.  But this move however loses a piece.  After which white will liquidate.  Since it's no longer pinned I had to move my DSB off of e7 to prevent this.
714,14,20,Bd7,b'r4k1r/pp1bRppp/5n2/1B1N4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',?? Completing my development.  The problem was that I did not count how many more defenders they had then me.  By playing this they'll win another piece.  Might sound contradictory and thus strange but the only other move that came into consideration was 15...Nxd5?? with the idea of winning back material.  However that would lose immediately because this would give them an immediate back rank mate with 16.Re8#  With that being said I'm not sure what the best move was but something else had to come into consideration.
715,14,21,Nxd7,b'r4k1r/pp1nRppp/8/3N4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',? Not a good choice though.  The idea is that it's liquidation but I wasn't losing an additional piece.  That was a terrible miscalculation because this loses the exchange and therefore further liquidates as they will take back which also still adds up to the loss of a piece.  By doing this they benefit because the idea is to exchange when ahead.
716,14,22,Re8,b'4rk1r/pp1R1ppp/8/3N4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',And now there's no choice but to give up a pawn.  If this weren't played I thought they would mate after 18.Ng5 followed by 19.Rxf7+  I now understand that they're would be a way around it but black still winds up in a lot of trouble.  In fact against opposition like this I'd normally resign.  The reason it's not happening is due to following the Supplemental Talking Talk Rules which states that you don't resign until they have a mating sequence.  Sometimes we don't see it so it means not resigning at all and letting them mate.  This is one of those times.  And I want this to blend in with the rules in order to post in the WTW Annotations Thread as this is good for learning purposes.
717,14,23,Rd8,b'3r1k1r/pR3ppp/8/3N4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Now that they took I'm not worried about the threat.  Instead I realized that they're going to grab another pawn.  When this happens my instincts were to win back a Knight.  Of course that quickly changes.
718,14,24,f5,b'3r1k1r/R5pp/8/3N1p2/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - f6',"Like the last time ""To take is a mistake.""  If I grab they're Nd5 they'll win a Rook after 30.Ra8+  Now I can't afford to lose anything else.  Of course I know that it's lost but it's about playing as well as you can which is believe it or not also part of the WTW rules (not to my surprise)."
719,14,25,2Ng5,b'3r1k1r/R5pp/8/3N1pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Preparing to fork my Kf8 and Rd8.
720,14,26,2Re8,b'4rk1r/R5pp/8/3N1pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',But I stop it.
721,14,27,2Rf7+,b'4rk1r/5Rpp/8/3N1pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',So they place me in check forcing my next move.
722,14,28,2Ne7+,b'4r1kr/4NRpp/8/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',After which they do it again.
723,14,29,2Rxe7,b'6kr/4rRpp/8/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',I didn't want to take because of what follows but unlike before it's forced.
724,14,30,Kf8,b'5k1r/4R1pp/8/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',This wasn't played simply to attack the Rook.  Instead I remember what happened in my most recent loss against Fred as we're in a similar situation believe it or not.  I almost surpassed 25 moves but made one mistake by leaving my monarch pinned since the Rook did not move off of where it should've been.  Although we can't depend on my inactive Rh8 the same thing applies but even more so here.  They're threatening an immediate mating net because of white's Ng5.  So if this weren't played the next move would be 24.Rd8#  Like that other game I wouldn't have lasted 25 moves so the idea was to learn from the mistake and prevent history from repeating itself.  That is despite being in a lost position as unlike before I've marked down the 25 move mark.
725,14,31,2Rae1,b'5k1r/4R1pp/8/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Going for the kill though.
726,14,32,2g6,b'5k1r/4R2p/6p1/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Still doing my best because if this weren't played they'd have the immediate 25.Rf8#  I knew it'd be soon but wasn't completely sure when mate would come.  But we can conclude and am thus happy to say that I've improve since my last game against easy19 despite a 14 point drop in my rating.
727,14,33,2Rf7+,b'5k1r/5R1p/6p1/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',As anticipated forcing my next move.
728,14,34,2Re8#,b'4R1kr/5R1p/6p1/5pN1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/6K1 b - -',Right after 25...Kg8 but a split second before this it's when I realized that he'd mate.  A few mistakes led to this moment but that's the general themes of WTW and/or LTR games.  It's training learning from your mistakes and improving which has happened.  Therefore I am proud of myself.
729,15,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As usual Sue likes to open with the King's Pawn Opening.
730,15,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As usual I like the Sicilian Defense.
731,15,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The most standard response in this Defense.
732,15,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I continue with the mainline.
733,15,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But Sue plays something that I haven't seen before.  The last time I saw anything like this was in the second Wizard Chess Game that I annotated.  But that was with check when I brought the Knight out.  I have seen similar moves but that is when my opponent attempts a SM.  Then I figured out that she has another threat.  The concern is 3...Ng5 (which threatens to win something.)
734,15,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So I stopped it cold by cutting the diagonal of that bishop.
735,15,6,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',And she castles.
736,15,7,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Meanwhile I continue because this is what I'm most used to.  The idea is exchanging.
737,15,8,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I'm not surprised to see this move played at all.
738,15,9,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',In my annotation with Wizard Chess reversion told me that this is the most common way to get out of check here.  And I checked out the game that he commented on.
739,15,10,Re1+,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',She checks again.
740,15,11,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',And I get out this way.  The idea being is that 7...Ne7 would've hindered my development.  Whether I got out that way or here the problem is that two of my pieces are pinned just like what we see with Jack Stockel.
741,15,12,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nbppp/8/1Bpp4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq d3',Preparing to get her DSB into play.  I looked at lines here.  One being 9.Bg5 with the possible loss of a bishop.  But I came to my senses that I could refute that with 9...f6 (despite not wanting to advance my weakest pawn).  What I felt would happen was losing a pawn.  But what I forgot is that it's protected by my Queen.  What the long term planned boiled down was not losing the time to develop but here I should've bypassed all of that.  This is because when Sue takes back I'll wind up with problems.
742,15,13,Ngf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/5n2/1B1p4/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',?? The focus was castling.  But the idea wasn't the usual of developing or connecting the Rooks.  My real plan was to break her two pins once and for all.  Afterall I remember what happened in a loss against Jack Stockel and went wrong by failing to undue it.  Likewise these pins were very dangerous.  And I should've given that up as best was 9...Kf8  This is the move that would've broken that pin and suddenly black might have wound up with problems.  By playing this she will win material and when that happens there will be no way to fix the problems.  In other words this is the losing blunder.
743,15,14,1Nf5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/5n2/1B1p1N2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I did not overlook this move.  But I underestimated how strong this was.
744,15,15,1Ne4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/8/1B1p1N2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',This is where I thought that there were only small problems.  10...g6 also came into consideration but she would still have 11.Re7+  However (and not to try to contrast what I say this was the best move)  The idea being that after 10...Rxe7+ 11.Kf8 I'd get tempo because her Knight would be forced to retreat.  
745,15,16,1Qxd5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/8/1B1Q1N2/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq -',I then said something but then deleted it as Sue has a lot of good options.  She wanted to know what was originally posted.  So I said that better was 11.Nxg7+.  11...Kf8 12.Qxd5 you're up two pawns because if 12...Kxg7 you can take back on e4.
746,15,17,1Nef6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/5n2/1B1Q1N2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq -',?? I posted that comment on the next move.  But I realize that after she retreats I'm still in a lot of trouble because she take on e7.  Eventually that will happen and when it does I'm down more then just two pawns.  I also realize that breaking the pin won't due at this point.  The reason for not playing 11...Kf8 was due to the loss of a piece.  This happens anyway.  Had that been played I might have gotten some counterplay.  With this move however it's over.  
747,15,18,Qa5,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/5n2/qB3N2/8/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq -',With the trouble I'm in I figure that I've got nothing better then to threaten her Rook.  At least the goal is making it difficult for Sue to win so that she learns.  However this doesn't make matter more difficult.  Her next move is what I had anticipated.  It just gives me an extra move before the damage is done.
748,15,19,Qb6,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1q3n2/1B3N2/8/3Q4/PPPB1PPP/RN2R1K1 w kq -',So the plan is to create a different that will be harder to drive off when Sue takes.
749,15,20,1Nxe7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nNppp/1q3n2/1B6/8/3Q4/PPPB1PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',Sue wanted that comment back.  But on this move I explained why that comment was deleted.  The idea being is that I anticipated this and with it she's now up a piece and pawn.  
750,15,21,1Kd8,b'r1bk3r/pp1nNppp/1q3n2/1B6/8/3Q4/PPPB1PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',The monarch must move to prevent a discovered check.  I don't like liquidating but the only other option was 14...Kf8  However when she takes it would be another free piece which I'm not willing to give away.
751,15,22,1Bg5,b'2rk3r/pp1n1ppp/1q3n2/1B4B1/8/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',With this second pin however I resigned.  She is definitely threatening a mating net because my Nf6 is effectively blocked.  After that I asked myself what could be done.  The only alternative is to give up my Queen for a Bishop on top of what I've lost.  Afterwhich I asked myself if there was a chance of counterplay looking at all the options.  Sure enough there isn't.  After the loss she has another mating threat and the only way out would be to accept further loss of material.  So I realized that there's definitely no way to stay in the game.  In other words it's now a resignable position.

Specifically I stressed that to superandy but when Joe does it it makes me smile because he's much stronger.  What it shows isn't just how much theory one needs to know but they also must remember and apply against TA as otherwise it could mean letting your guard which often spells disaster.  This is no exception.
766,17,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',As anticipated his opponent develops a central pawn.  The idea being of course to mobilize his K side and castle.
767,17,2,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/P6P/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3',And now we have the Crab Opening.  As mentioned in another annotation Joe is testing his opponents to see if they can keep their advantage.  The idea being that in blitz you must play fast but accurately.  Against a senior master and at this speed your chances of doing that is less then the chance of getting a Royal Straight Flush in a poker game.
768,17,3,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/P6P/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But this time I'm surprised to see black this.  Although Joe can deviate his opponents should not do that.  Instead I would've developed my Ng8 at once as black.
769,17,4,a5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/P3p3/7P/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Advancing his wing pawn.  My guess is that Joe's long term plan is to get a passed pawn but time will tell.
770,17,5,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/P2pp3/7P/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Meanwhile black prepares to mobilize his Q side.
771,17,6,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/P2pp2P/8/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Advancing his other wing pawn.  My theory is still the same.
772,17,7,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/5p2/P1bpp2P/8/8/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',As I anticipated.
773,17,8,c3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/5p2/P1bpp2P/8/2P5/1P1PPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Blocking his Nb1 but this is a different aspect of the plan involving c2 since he will advance the d4.  Although this is not the Ruy Lopez (where black plays ...Bc5) the same concept still applies which is white gaining tempo as we're about to see.  And I can apply this in my games.  In fact this will help me to remember what happens if Jack decides to playb Bc5 in the future which is another example of how much one can learn by studying these games.
774,17,9,Bf5,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp3pp/5p2/P1bppb1P/8/2P5/1P1PPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Meanwhile black waists no time in continuing with his development.
775,17,10,Nf3,b'rn1qk1nr/ppp3pp/5p2/P1bppb1P/8/2P2N2/1P1PPPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',But now Joe starts developing.  Meanwhile black will exchange Bishop for Knight.  In my opinion this is pointless because black's Bf5 is mobile whereas TA's Nb1 is not.  That makes it an open position which makes the bishop more dangerous based on what I learned with his Sodium Attack.
776,17,11,Nc6,b'r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/P1bpp2P/8/2P2N2/1P1PPPP1/1RBQKB1R w Kkq -',Meanwhile black continues with his development.

This was the point behind 5.c3 but especially in this particular position since black's DSB is on c5.  Just like what reversion previously explained it's now attacked and while it might not appear Joe is going to gain to time. 
778,17,13,exd4,b'r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/P1bp3P/3p4/2P2N2/1P2PPP1/1RBQKB1R w Kkq -',? By taking it appears that black now winds up in a lot of trouble.  It's hard to say for sure but black will wind up with problems.  Instead I would've retreated to from c5-e7.  
779,17,14,a6,b'r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/P1n2p2/2bp3P/3p4/2P2N2/1P2PPP1/1RBQKB1R b Kkq -',So Joe exploits the weakness that black left for himself with this move as now he threatens a passed pawn.  Taking doesn't help because he would do that away from the center plus have isolated pawns.  Now that we're passed the opening doubled pawns can become problematic here.
780,17,15,b6,b'r2qk1nr/p1p3pp/Ppn2p2/2bp3P/3p4/2P2N2/1P2PPP1/1RBQKB1R w Kkq -',So black in my books made the right choice.  In fact I also would've played this.
781,17,16,1b4,b'r2qk1nr/p1p3pp/Ppn2p2/2bp3P/1P1p4/2P2N2/4PPP1/1RBQKB1R b Kkq b3',Continuing that plan of gaining time.  For black however the loss of time is especially problematic in this situation as we're about to see.

785,17,20,Qd7,b'r3k2r/p1pqn1pp/Pp1bNp2/nP1p3P/8/2P5/4PPP1/1RBQKB1R w Kkq -',The idea being if this was played a move earlier Joe's N would not be able to come to e6.  Now that it has he will take.
786,17,21,Kd8,b'r2k3r/p1pqn1Np/Pp1b1p2/nP1p3P/8/2P5/4PPP1/1RBQKB1R w K -',! Best.  Now 14...Kf8?? appears to be stronger since one would think it gains tempo with the N attacked.  That isn't so.  It turns out that moving the monarch to f8 will lead to mate after 15.Bh6 because of something like 16.Ne6# as now we have a mating net.  The reason for doing Homework on this is because I would've missed the threat which shows just how much there is to learn and why studying these blitz games is part of my assignments.  So like what we saw with Wizard Chess or my recent loss against bhidragon the idea here is pattern recognition and seeing the big picture.  In doing so part of my weaknesses turn into strengths.  In fact that happened when not only did I learn not to resign early (from those Q sacs) but I then taught it to my students with one being able to pull a couple of swindles.

In fact I met a similar fate with nuntar as noted in my most recent annotation where I tried to reattack and got mated sooner
790,17,25,1Ng6,b'r2k2r1/p1pq2Np/Pp1b1pnP/nP1p4/8/2P1P3/5PP1/1RBQKB1R w K -',? I'm not sure why black this but just about all other moves was better then this.  It turns out that the N on e7 prevented Joe's next move.  By moving it black will find himself in a lot of trouble. 
791,17,26,Rxg7,b'r2k4/p1pq2rp/Pp1b1pnP/nP1Q4/8/2P1P3/5PP1/1RB1KB1R w K -',?? Much better was for black to move his Ra8.  Like what we saw in some of my past games including the second loss against the computer with Wizard Chess black got greedy and wanted the N.  But by taking he will lose both of his Rooks in return since when Joe takes black will be in check forcing his 18th move.  In fact it gets more dangerous because getting the second rook guarantees a passed pawn which will also prove to be a killer.
792,17,27,Be5,b'Q7/p1pqk1Pp/Pp3pn1/nP2b3/8/2P1P3/5PP1/1RB1KB1R w K -',?? I'm not sure why black played this but 19...Qd8 was forced.  Of course Joe would liquidate which black doesn't want.  That's why I presume that this was played but it's better the what's to come as white will promote.  And when that happens it will go downhill for black.  In fact he's busted but this will force white's win even sooner.
793,17,28,2Ba3+,b'Q7/p1pqk1Pp/Pp3pn1/nP2b3/8/B1P1P3/5PP1/1R2KB1R b K -',I would've promoted at once but like this move better though since his monarch will have less options.  In fact I'm pretty sure that this is what Joe has in mind since there is a mating sequence here that Joe will force even sooner.
794,17,29,Kf5,b'Q5Q1/p1pq3p/Pp3pn1/nP2bk2/8/B1P1P3/5PP1/1R2KB1R w K -',Forced which is also why 20.Ba3+  The idea being is that had Joe promoted immediately (right then and there) black would have other options.  And mate would've taken much longer and in fact tlafleur123 might have been able to dodge the bullet and possible force a stalemate.  Well the logic is to deny black the slightest chance of counterplay.
795,17,30,Kg5,b'6Q1/p1pq3p/Pp3pn1/nP2b1k1/8/B1P1PQ2/5PP1/1R2KB1R w K -',Of course black had a couple of other options.  22...Nf4 or 22...Bf4  He didn't want to lose a another piece but Joe's move would've been the same regardless.  And it would still be mate.
796,17,31,2Rh5#,b'6Q1/p1pq3p/Pp3pn1/nP2b1kR/8/B1P1PQ2/5PP1/1R2KB2 b - -',The overall moral is that stronger players like Joe can disregard basic openings and get away with them especially in blitz.  But less experienced players need to abide by them unless there's good reason not to.  Plus it's more then just openings as one must need to know their theory and apply what they've learned by studying them.  If you've learned but don't study someone like TA will be able to crush their opponents.  I've seen many examples in that club and have introduced some to the club with how much learning there is.  And one thing remains perhaps the most important theory is a vital part to that curb.  With that being said when Joe boasts about these wins he's actually teaching them what other threats to be weary of.  In doing so one learns and can apply that to his or her long correspondence games as I have.  Moreover I've then used a couple of those methods to teach my students.
797,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with my usual.
798,18,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I'm not surprised that he played this as it's the most common.  I wasn't sure what to expect since this was my first time against Michael.  However after seeing this and my next move would be I anticipated that this would become a Ruy Lopez which is what happened.
799,18,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',However better was to castle.  This is what reversion has noticed before playing this.  The only thing to note is that this move was played before my game against Jack Stockel.  Therefore I was only remembering what tipsyjourneyman said which is that it's preferable to hold off on castling until later.  He recommended this move.  However I base things on what cplusplus11 has also noted.  And after that game he said to learn some theory because after this variation (which you most often see) 5.0-0 is most often played.  Like that game I was worried about losing a pawn after ....Nxe4.  The truth however is that black would not be able to hold onto it after white plays Re1.  Had this happened after my game with Jack I would've stuck to mainlines.
800,18,3,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Consequently Michael develops whilst punishes me for my last move since I can no longer gain tempo with 6.c3 followed by 7.d4.
801,18,4,d3,b'r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"But as chesskingdom64 has noted ""There's always another way of doing something.""  The idea behind ""the c3-d4 plans"" involves a pawn chain.  I remember this based on comments from reversion.  Now I considered 6.d4 with an exchange except even afterwards I'm down a pawn.  With this move however not only do I have an open line for my Bc1 but white now has a solid pawn chain.  The only question is if it holds."
802,18,5,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Meanwhile Michael castles.

Part of it is because I was worried about the possibility of 7...Ng4 which would threaten the fork.  7.Be3 was playable but I was not going to exchange bishops as I'd lose my weakest pawn.  When that happens you're in a lot of trouble as I learned from TA.  For one thing it would make castling short unsafe but there's more to it because afterwards you're vulnerable.  Make one error and it's generally over.  Well I wasn't going to take a risk of being caught in that situation.
804,18,7,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Centralizing his Rook which is generally good.

In addition this is also becoming a closed position since his pawns are blocking the center.  Now it boils down to which N is stronger.  I figured that his Nf6 is more of a liability so I decide to play right away.  Of course I'm aware that it will result in doubled pawns.  But in this position it's of no asset since we have not reached the midgame yet.  And major pieces haven't been exchanged as I've learned from tactical-abyss.  In addition I accurately calculate the gain of tempo for white since black must retreat keeping in mind what reversion said when it came to c3 followed by d4 when a bishop is near there.  Although a different position it's still applicable to me.
806,18,9,1Nxe5,b'r1bqr1k1/1pppnppp/p7/2bPN3/B7/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So I decide to exchange knowing that when he takes back the doubled pawns are gone.  This is something that TA also outlined when determining if they're a liability or not.
807,18,10,1d4,b'r1bqr1k1/1ppp1ppp/p7/2bnN3/B2P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Part of the plan involved the gain of more time btw.
808,18,11,1Bb3,b'r1bqr1k1/bppp1ppp/p7/3nN3/3P4/1B6/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Going after his Nd5.
809,18,12,1d6,b'r1bqr1k1/bpp2ppp/p2p4/3nN3/3P4/1B6/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Michael has the same idea adding a pawn chain and gaining tempo himself.
810,18,13,1Nf3,b'r1bqr1k1/bpp2ppp/p2p4/3n4/3P4/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I did consider 13.Bxd5 with a supposed idea of winning a pawn after 13...dxe5 14.dxe5 but figured out that he would play 14...Rxe5 (afterwards).  The only reason behind this move was the win of material.  So after figuring out how he'd win that I determined that taking would be pointless and thus decided to protect.  Afterall as kenneth_fiore_3 noted you don't just exchange for the thrill of it.  Instead there has to be a good reason.  It appeared there was earlier but not in this position.  That is especially because by not doing so I'm going to gain time.
811,18,14,1Bg5,b'r1bqr1k1/bpp2ppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3P4/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Which enables me to complete my development whilst pinning his N.

Before I couldn't play 16.Ne5 so I felt that this left him with a weakness.  That's why I take that opportunity to attack as there's no immediate threat plus white gains time in the process.
815,18,18,1Rae1,b'r2qr1k1/bpp2ppp/p4n2/3pN1Bb/3P4/1B1Q4/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Which I use to centralize one of my Rooks.

817,18,20,1c4,b'r2qr1k1/bp3ppp/p1p2n2/3pN1Bb/2PP4/1B1Q4/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - c3',? But figuring that it was pointless I decide to exchange.  In doing so however I missed the picture as Mike will win the pawn.  I thought I could win it back by exchanging but this is where calculating deeper into the variations was important as reversion told me.  And it's important to note that I lost a recent Wizard Chess Game with that mistake so it's really something to work on.  
818,18,21,2Nd3,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p2n2/6Bb/2Bb4/3N4/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Knowing that my N was en-prise however I retreat.
819,18,22,2Ne4,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/6Bb/2Bbn3/3N4/PP3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Except that I'm in more trouble then I could've realized.  Michael going for a Knight fork which turns out to be inevitable.  
820,18,23,2Nf4,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/6Bb/2BbnN2/8/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',But at the time I didn't think it was.  So I do what I can to defend against the threat.  The idea is that Michael wants to my Re1 for a Knight which is only worth 2.  This would add to a total of 3 do to being a pawn down.  Therefore I go right after his Bh5 knowing that if Michael takes I equalize by capturing his LSB for free.
821,18,24,2Bf3,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/6B1/2BbnN2/5b2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Michael wisely retreats with a counterattack.  It was then that I realized my fate.  
822,18,25,2Bh4,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2BbnN1B/5b2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',I considered taking on f3.  But then I thought about it and with Michael leaving en-prise (deliberately) there must be a good reason for giving away.  As we saw with the Damino's Defense when training someone stronger players don't just blunder things away.  It was then that I figured out something important.  Michael wants me to take because doing this means exposing my King.  However he was not going to fool me because I made a similar mistake against Jack Stockel (in our last game each other) which resulted in a different plan.  So the decision was made to keep my DSB aligned knowing that if he takes I've got a defender.  In other words I'll be able to take without exposing my monarch.
823,18,26,2Bg4,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2BbnNbB/8/PP3PPP/4RRK1 w - -',Knowing this he retreats.
824,18,27,2g3,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2BbnNbB/6P1/PP3P1P/4RRK1 b - -',In case Michael has any mating ideas in the long run I open up.
825,18,28,2Nd2,b'r3r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2Bb1NbB/6P1/PP1n1P1P/4RRK1 w - -',As anticipated.   Afterall Michael has a winning advantage.
826,18,29,2Rxe8+,b'r3R1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2Bb1NbB/6P1/PP1n1P1P/5RK1 b - -',So I do whatever possible to prevent that.  Without much to lose I'm just hoping that he'll go wrong somewhere.  But I'm also bearing in mind that he won't.  Instead the plan is using memory techniques based on what archduke_piccolo when he was losing against redfoxrising which is just being aggressive.  The other plan is what comes after this.  So when you're losing it pays off to be overconfident.  In some cases I've managed to pull swindles by being optimistic.  Against stronger players however that usually does not work.
827,18,30,2Rc1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2Bb1NbB/6P1/PP1n1P1P/2R3K1 b - -',Figuring that I might have dodged the bullet I play this.  As noted even though I don't like liquidating when behind this was part of my plan behind 25.Rxe8+  However this was to an extent Hope Chess since I overlooked a bigger threat.  I don't know if it's the full definition because it boils down to hoping that you've met a threat without calculating.  Well white wasn't hoping but missed a bigger threat anyhow.  Instead I'd call it Flip Coin Chess because in reality I didn't take quite enough time and wound becoming overly confident since there didn't appear much else to lose.  Either way white is busted.
828,18,31,2Bf3,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/2Bb1N1B/5bP1/PP1n1P1P/2R3K1 w - -',This was played to trap my monarch.

831,18,34,2Rf1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/p1p5/8/5N1B/3B1bP1/Pb1n1P1P/5RK1 b - -',But this way however I get something in return.
832,18,35,h6,b'4r1k1/1p3pp1/p1p4p/8/5N1B/3B1bP1/Pb3P1P/5K2 w - -',Advancing one of his pawns as this will win more material.
833,18,36,3Bc4,b'4r1k1/1p3pp1/p1p4p/8/2B2N1B/5bP1/Pb3P1P/5K2 b - -',Which I attempt to stop.

835,18,38,3Ng2,b'4r1k1/1p3pp1/p1p4p/8/2B4B/2b2bP1/P4PNP/5K2 b - -',"Knowing what kind of trouble I might be in this is where I try to liquidate.  If I can eliminate his Bf3 there might be a chance to save this game.  Remember the club game that happened with stalhandske and brigadecommander where I was given Homework over why a move was bad.  The idea being that the bishop would be blocked so white I believe would lose a piece for a pawn.  In this position however there was no way out.  It's definitely resignable at this point.  But resignation however isn't going to be option because of what GM Judit Polgar said which is ""Fight Til the End.""  In fact I annotated a game that I won in a lost position with that title.  Moreover I've told my students not to resign.  And one of them was able to pull a swindle on two occasions by remembering my advise."
836,18,39,3Bxg5,b'4r1k1/1p3p2/p1p4p/6B1/2B5/2b2bP1/P4PNP/5K2 b - -',At least I get a pawn in return.  It's true that I'm being overoptimistic but with no way out I think positive as opposed to negative.  It's also important to note that being this way has helped me to improve as well.
837,18,40,3Ne3,b'4r1k1/1p3p2/p1p5/6p1/2B5/2b1NbP1/P4P1P/5K2 b - -',In addition my position is no longer cramped for now.

839,18,42,3Nf5+,b'4r3/1p3pk1/p1p5/5Np1/2B5/2b2bP1/P4P1P/5K2 b - -',But I will stop at nothing to place him in check since the idea is trying to get counterplay.  
840,18,43,3Nd6,b'4r3/1p3p2/p1pN2k1/6p1/2B5/2b2bP1/P4P1P/5K2 b - -',?? But this is the final blunder.  My focus was going after my N reattacking and gaining tempo.  However Michael has a back rank mate threat that I overlooked.  By playing this he will mate.  35.Ne3 was forced as it was only the way to protect my Knight whilst the back rank.

843,19,1,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Preparatory move I presume I know it is used to defend against the knight landing on g5. 
844,19,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And here it is Nf3.  This move protects h4 and could be a threat to the king if I were able to move onto g5 but this is not possible with pawn at h6.
845,19,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black played the French opening wing gambit and moved e6 getting ready for his next move d5.
846,19,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I develop my LB to c4 it covers two diagonals.  I thought that this may stop d5 move but black was not going to let this bishop stop him taking the d5 square.
847,19,5,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',Black now played d5 which I had not realised was now protected twice by the pawn and the queen.
848,19,6,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3P4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I thought I should take d5 pawn and no doubt black would reciprocate.
849,19,7,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3p4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This now left me with a pawn which I could not take since the queen was protecting it.  I should have seen that I would be left with a defended pawn which I would not be able to capture.
850,19,8,Be2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I moved LB back to e2!  All my advantage given away.  I should have moved my LB back to b3 rather than e2 but I thought I was protecting my king.
851,19,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black looks better just now.  I have only one piece developed and as white I had the advantage but I lost it.

I learned that I need to take more time before I move and feel I do take more time now.

893,20,5,Bxd2+,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/8/3N1p2/2pP4/5Q2/PPPb1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq -',Black tries a largely benign attack though it does serve to prevent White from castling.
894,20,6,Kxd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/8/3N1p2/2pP4/5Q2/PPPK1PPP/R4BNR b kq -',A few exchanges later the board is clear - only now Black is left with stranded pawns and nothing else while White controls the center with both a queen and a knight as well as having an open path for his rook.
895,20,7,Qxf6,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/5q2/5p2/2pP4/5Q2/PPPK1PPP/R4BNR w kq -',Black attempts to challenge White for the center of the board; White aggressively denies him.  Knights are exchanged.

898,20,10,1Bxc4+,b'rnb4r/pp3kpp/5q2/5p2/2BP4/5Q2/PPPK1PPP/4R1NR b - -',White is relentless taking a pawn and continuing the pressure on Black.

900,20,12,1Qa3+,b'rnb2k1r/pp4pp/5q2/5p2/2BP4/Q7/PPPK1PPP/4R1NR b - -',White drives the dagger in.  Black's only option is to block with his queen and instead of losing another piece he resigns.
901,21,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The only time I've seen this before was when my opponent attempted SM.  However people who've surpassed novice status would not do that.  Despite Knights before Bishops it's a solid move.  But given that it's 1.e4 e5 themed tourney (with it's starting position I must think about what to do.)  
902,21,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',So I decide to develop since that's generally the best alternative.  2...d5 came into consideration with an idea of calculating what to do after 3.exd5  The problem is that this would lose a pawn.  And the idea is not blundering so early.

The idea behind this move is to prevent my Knight from getting undeveloped on f8.  5...Nh5? also came into consideration except as usual a Knight on the rim is dim.  Had I played that he would've won a piece after removing his Nf3 as it leaves me with a discovered.  So this appears to be the best move but according to reversion it was not.  In it he said ...""your 5º move was an inaccuracy already. Better was 5...d5 counterattacking my bishop instead. You'll see this is a very common idea in the Max-Lange Attack(1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Bc5). In fact the positions would be quite similar."""
909,21,8,Qe2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/2Bpn3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',As now that he's reattacked my Knight I must think about what to do here.
910,21,9,Ng5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P1n1/2Bp4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',?? Therefore I thought I could protect this way and aniticipated his next move believe it or not.  But I thought I could answer with 7...Qxg5 until the next move where I saw his Bc1 to stop that.

Can't see another reason for this move.  jkarp: I definitely overlooked that. I saw it was attacked before asked myself what I could do to defend. I thought this was the only move but it still got attacked.  The he explained about what happened after the 5th move by saying "" And for your 6º move d5 was better once again giving the pawn back to get castled in a sharp tactical line running after 7.exd6 e.p O-O 8.dxc7(8.Qxe4?

912,21,11,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/2b1P1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',jkarp: They are very similar when going back to the fifth move. But after 9.Qxe4 I would not play 9...Bb4+. Instead I'd pin with 9...Re8 right away. I once had a game like this with Reuben saw that I could pin and executed it. Similarly the pin involved the Queen.  reversion: e8 is undefended in that line(Black's Q is on c7) allowing 10.Qxe8+.  jkarp: Yes I overlooked that which is quite bad. I remember now don't know when but sometime ago I looked at a similar line. But I missed that the move played was undefended. Consequently the opponent won a piece. I believe it was a Rook and shortly after that the game went downhill.   
913,21,12,Nxf7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppqNpp/8/2b1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',As I anticipated reversion takes my weakest pawn.  With that combined with TA's blitz Q sacs (involving the weakest pawn) I asked myself what could be done in this position.  The reason behind 8.Qe7 is that he was threatening to fork my Queen and Rh8.  By bringing the Queen to e7 I thought I'd gotten out of trouble and was gaining confidence.  However the trouble has just begun as we're about to see.
914,21,13,Rf8,b'rnb1kr2/ppppqNpp/8/2b1P3/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',?? Figuring that I've bailed out I played this.  It did not appear that he could anything else until ...
915,21,14,Bg5,b'rnb1kr2/ppppqNpp/8/2b1P1B1/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R b KQq -',This move.  reversion: Hm looks like your queen has been trapped...  jkarp: It has just when I thought I'd gotten out of trouble. 
916,21,15,Qxf7,b'rnb1kr2/pppp1qpp/8/2b1P1B1/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R w KQq -',Knowing that my Queen was busted I was doing calculation.  If I didn't take the Queen would be free.  By playing this I get a piece in return but as we will see it's not enough to compensate anyhow.  
917,21,16,1Nd2,b'rnb1k3/pppp1rpp/8/2b1P1B1/3p4/8/PPPNQPPP/R3K2R b KQq -',Meanwhile he continues developing.
918,21,17,1Nc6,b'r1b1k3/pppp1rpp/2n5/2b1P1B1/3p4/8/PPPNQPPP/R3K2R w KQq -',And I have the same idea in mind.

But this however makes matter worse.  reversion: No not there! Your bishop has been attacked already on c5 so there's no sense putting it back on that same square. Probably better is ...dxc3 getting rid of your doubled pawn and leaving me with 2 isolated ones(a2 and c3) then retreating it to e7/f8.  As in our previous game we should only continue if there's something needful to be learned here. Otherwise just resign this game and move on.  jkarp: In general I agree. But I'm planning to annotate it. I won't change the name but will add WTW. They have rules which state that one continues until mate can be forced. Otherwise I would've resigned after the loss of my Queen. It could still work if I didn't post in that club. But given that the tourney was from those annotations it means that I talked the talk which resulted in this game which they call Walking the Walk (WTW). With that I intend to post it in the WTW Annotations thread but resigning now means that they will question it as this is what happened in one of my games against Jack Stockel.  This might sound shocking but I also told everyone in that thread that I'm playing several simultaneous WTW games with the very last post.  The mini tournaments is what I was implying.  Then I showed him the link where Fred questioned as otherwise I would've resigned right after he took my Queen.    
923,21,22,Rf5,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/2n5/2N1PrB1/3p4/2P5/PP2QPPP/R3K2R w KQq -',So I played a similar to what we discussed on the 5 and degree marks by hitting his e5 and Bg5.
924,21,23,1Qh5+,b'r1b1k3/pppp2pp/2n5/2N1PrBQ/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQq -',But that does not bother reversion because of this.

But he pointed out that I did not.  reversion: Very well. So might play some cheapo moves to end it quicker   Now your Rg5 is lost but it was hard to suggest a good plan anyway...  jkarp: I agree that there are no good moves left. Once over I'm sure that we'll get a lot of comments and it'll be shown to Fred.  
928,21,27,Kf7,b'r1b5/pppp1k2/2n3p1/2N1P1Q1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Still doing whatever possible I bring my monarch into action.  The idea being that the K is a powerful weapon in the endgame.

930,21,29,2Kg8,b'r1b3k1/pppp4/2n2Qp1/2N1P3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',The other option was 20...Ke8 but my idea is bringing the monarch to h8 because Jack Stockel has told me that bringing it into the corner is part of King safety.
931,21,30,2h4,b'r1b3k1/pppp4/2n2Qp1/2N1P3/3p3P/2P5/PP3PP1/R3K2R b KQ h3',reversion: Regarding what you said about your club you're alluding to a game against Jack that were a rook ending where you resigned early but easy19 said it wasn't that easy for Black to win right?  The difference was that in that game the material is approx equal while here my material advantage is evident and you have zero counterplay. That's a basic principle to know when to resign - great material disadvantage with no counterplay at all.  jkarp: That's why. I misinterpreted the difference which often happens to me. Yes there's a big discrepency between that and what we have now. And it's true that he said that it wasn't easy for Jack to win. That's the example he showed.  I'm going to see what happens when I resign and annotate. Hopefully he won't question it since you do have a forced win. So I'll keep my fingers crossed.  And it also turns out that in this position reversion has a forced mate as he told me.  Had I continued he would've advanced the h pawn another square.  If I take he uses his Queen and Rh1 for a final attack.  If I don't take he'll mate by promoting the h pawn.  That's something we reviewed right after the game.

GameKnot may have recommended this to you but I am betting you could find this move on your own as well. Why? Because advancing the e-pawn gives you a firm grip on the center takes away d5 from him gives you easy development of your LSB (light-squared bishop) an additional diagonal of infiuence for your queen and contests control of f5.
An impressive list yes? But then good moves will usually serve several purposes! And guess what - that *is* a very very good way of finding the good moves in any position: select a move which serves multiple purposes.

Shouldn't he concentrate on getting his king castled instead? Well yes. However this move does have the advantage of contesting your space advantage on the queen-side and you will be forced to spend a move responding to that. So it doesn't really cost him anything - directly. However as the game continuation shows he will be more or less forced to follow up with a5 to support that pawn and *that* move will cost him time better spent elsewhere. For that reason I believe b5 is a strategic mistake.
Gameknot agrees with that assessment by the way adding to your evaluated positional advantage.

He is going to move the king away from the e-file rather immediately and you have little hope of gaining control of it even if you do succeed in opening it. I think it would be more logical to continue what you already started and fire up the queen-side some more... axb seems a reasonable continuation (as Gameknot also suggests) but you might also take a close look at moves like d5! Again: any opening of the center while he remains uncastled is highly likely to favour you.

The bishop - on g3 it will have only a single square of control (h4). Additionallym if moving it to g3 is to have any meaning it should be because the pawn advance f2-f4 is planned and the bishop is needed to support that. However until and unless that advance happens the bishop is going to be severely handicapped: essentially White is now playing a bishop down.

Now while the position remains closed time is not of much essence. White as well as Black can generally take the time he needs to move his pieces about. After all the opponent is severely restricted and cannot easily get to you. What does matter is the effective positioning of your pieces - both in defence and in offence. Because once the break comes - as it must if the game is not to be drawn - things are likely to speed up exceedingly! Ideally your pieces will then be like a torrent forcing their way past the breach and into the unshielded enemy land beyond. If as in the present game you effect the breach and then your pieces have to maneurver and labour to trickle through one by one you achieve far less of an effect.

But as they are right now they are more a nuisance than an actual threat and this allows Black the freedom to start actions against White's position. This should never have been allowed to happen.

Though the deterrent is probably only psychological as white would still have a good game had he chosen to 0-0-0 here. White also has the option to let the pawn go to energize his rooks and black would be ill advised to take the b2 with white now capturing the b7 pawn and the ensuing pig on the 7th would be unenviable for black to say the least.

The similarity to Carlsen's game is breathtaking. The great Danish grandmaster already played in Carlsen's mode: he got the knight to f4 pushed his h-pawn and exchanged it on g6.  In his book Studies for Practical Players published by Russell Enterprises in 2009 the outstanding Russian chess composer Oleg Pervakov wrote:"" White has opened the h-file and taken aim at the black king. It would be nice to push the queen over to h2 - but how? The d2-e1-g1-h2 route is pretty long and would grant Black time to whip up counterplay on the queenside. Larsen finds a cardinal solution to the problem."" And indeed Larsen's line-clearing on the second rank is remarkable: 20.g4! Nxg4 21.f3! exf3 22.Bxf3 Ne5 23.Qh2 and the queen is ready to infiltrate Black's position. Larsen's attack can be replayed at the end of this article.
Let's see how Carlsen did it."

This beautiful interference brings us to William Steinitz's best game played 120 years ago in Hastings. His opponent the German count Curt von Bardeleben did everything to stop the d-pawn and yet Steinitz did not blink and pushed the pawn forward to d5.  It freed the square d4 for the knight that jumped further to the square e6 signaling one of the most beautiful attacking finishes. The attack can be replayed at the end of the article."

Kg2 means his king is very passive while my king can just  walk into the queen side and win. H3-h4 leaves his king side pawns weak and perhaps vulnerable to my king.

Conversely have been defeated almost every time I've faced it. Here black intends on denying white control of the center or exchanging a flank pawn for a center pawn.

I thought giving up the the center early might be unexpected for my opponent. (Note: I've tried this strategy on 2000+ players and it NEVER works). The idea will be to attack the center from the flank later with force later. The DSB and the queen side knight will apply pressure on the d4 square since the e file pawn has passed and can't defend. Black's DSB turns out to be pivotal to this game once it is in fianchetto position. 
1322,33,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White confronts the black pawn on c5 which is undefended. The first instinct might be to defend. However there are several reasons I decided to leave it undefended. (1) I need to stick to my strategy (2) I already pushed g6 and weakened the future king-side castle so I need to fianchetto and (3) if white takes on c5 then my original goal of weakening white's center is accomplished albeit at a material expense. A white pawn on c5 would be difficult to defend. I couldn't think of a good reason for defending the c5 pawn other than 1 point of material.

1324,33,6,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White's LSB puts pressure on the weak f7 pawn and prepares for a future attack on the castle. 
1325,33,7,cxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I want to bring the queen side knight out but white has the d4 pawn that could immediately threaten and push me around so I take d4. 
1326,33,8,cxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',...and white takes it back. I live the fact that the DSB is staring down at the white queen side rook; although this really doesn't materialize into anything. More importantly I think 4...cxd4 leaves the white d4 pawn needing defense by a minor or major piece. Probably inconvenient for white.
1327,33,9,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black knight puts more pressure on d4.
1328,33,10,Ne2,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White needs to add a defender to d4. I think 6. Nf3 would have been better but I'm not sure. This moves also solidifies white's intent to castle kind side.
1329,33,11,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I need to get the king side knight in play. However if I need to ensure white cannot move to e5 and push my knight around so I made this pawn move. This also opens up my bishop lines a bit. However does allow white to pin my knight... we'll see.
1330,33,12,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP2NPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',white decides to castle instead of pin. 
1331,33,13,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BPP3/8/PP2NPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',so I put the knight in play. This has the temporary affect of reducing the tension on d4 but changes white's focus to the hanging pawn on e4.
1332,33,14,Nbc3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',and white defends e4. At this point I see my queen and DSG lining up at e4.. I just need to get all those other pieces out to of the way  :)
1333,33,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',but first defend and work towards connecting the rooks.

I can't ignore the wall of white I'm facing but they really aren't well supported. Post game analysis confirmed 9. f4 to be a mistake and the game turning point. The computer thinks the best move would be to defend d4 with the DSB.
1335,33,17,Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2BPnP2/2N5/PP2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I took the pawn thinking noticing a potential fork at d5 if white retakes.
1336,33,18,1Nxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2BPNP2/8/PP2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Leaves black down -2 but this moves leaves an isolated queen pawn on the d4 square I've been targeting the whole game. In addition there's a fork at d5. Not sure what else white should do here.
1337,33,19,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/3p4/2BPNP2/8/PP2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',haven't done that many pawn forks always fun.

1339,33,21,1dxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PpP2/1B6/PP2N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',take.

1341,33,23,1Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PpPb1/1B2B3/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',pinned the defender and connected all the big guys! At this point I was fairly certain I had this game. I really like the way everything connected up and was achieving my original goal of d4. 
1342,33,24,1Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PpPb1/1B2B3/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 b - -',white attempts to remove the pin.. but I'm ahead in material so...

1344,33,26,1Qxe2,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PpP2/1B2B3/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',white complies leaving d4.. there's blood in the water.
1345,33,27,1Nxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3npP2/1B2B3/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I see the end now... I just need white to take the knight and we're done.
1346,33,28,1Bxd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3BpP2/1B6/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Yes!! Not sure if white could have done anything else here but I think that's the right move for white here.
1347,33,29,1Qxd4+,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3qpP2/1B6/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Check. White has successfully implemented a flank attack and now controls d4 with tempo. Look at how important the DSB has become. White has no counter attack potential on the black king and black has really taken center control. Note: If black takes d4 with the bishop instead of the queen it sets up a potential pin opportunity for the white rook. The queen is much more adept here.
1348,33,30,1Kh1,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3qpP2/1B6/PP2Q1PP/R4R1K b - -',forced move.
1349,33,31,1e6,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/4p1p1/8/3qpP2/1B6/PP2Q1PP/R4R1K w - -',I thought about taking on b2 and offering a queen trade. However this left e7 vulnerable and the white LSB still staring at my king. 16...e6 seemed like a good way to use the extra tempi. 
1350,33,32,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/4p1p1/8/3qpP2/1B6/PP2Q1PP/3R1R1K b - -',still leaves the b2 pawn hanging and I was going to offer the exchange anyway. I don't like the fact that white owns the d file but that doesn't really matter that much now. I notice the king is buried behind his pawns and see a potential tactical queen sacrifice if white doesn't choose the exchange.
1351,33,33,1Qxb2,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/4p1p1/8/4pP2/1B6/Pq2Q1PP/3R1R1K w - -',offer the exchange.

1353,33,35,1b5,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/4p1p1/1p6/4QP2/1B6/Pq4PP/3R1R1K w - b6',b5 keeps the LSB bishop from interfering with the queen sac.
1354,33,36,1Rd7,b'r4rk1/p2R1pbp/4p1p1/1p6/4QP2/1B6/Pq4PP/5R1K b - -',white doesn't see it... white is interested in lining up his queen and rook along the 7th row but too late for that.
1355,33,37,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/p2R1pbp/4p1p1/1p6/4QP2/1B6/Pq4PP/5R1K w - -',Rook to position maybe white sees it now. If he moves his queen back have to think of something else.
1356,33,38,2Rxa7,b'2r2rk1/R4pbp/4p1p1/1p6/4QP2/1B6/Pq4PP/5R1K b - -',no he is intent on the 7th row attack. Just not enough time left for that.
1357,33,39,2Qf2,b'2r2rk1/R4pbp/4p1p1/1p6/4QP2/1B6/P4qPP/5R1K w - -',"There's the queen sacrifice. I owe this one to my club (WoW)... we were just talking about queen sacrifices for advantage in a discussion list and started me thinking. 

In the best case scenario for white he loses the a7 rook. Worst case the game is over.

White chooses to resign. I would have liked to play this out but white would have been seriously behind in material. 

Thanks for the game shambobala and setting up this MT. I am looking forward to playing this tournament as white!"
1358,34,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',It's more unusual then the Owen's or Grunfeld's Defense which is another reason for studying.  What I've been told is that it's good to get used to something different in case your opponent plays.  This is called the Dunst Opening.  While the other two are unusual this is an irregular opening.
1359,34,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So Ken goes for it with a fianchetto.
1360,34,2,Nb1,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',As I've seen before Joe brings his N and then he hides back to it's original square.  He's testing Ken and this will continue for a while.
1361,34,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Developing his Bishop.
1362,34,4,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Similar to before Joe brings out his other N.  Likewise that will also move back and forth for some time.
1363,34,5,d6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile Ken prepares to get his DSB into play by developing a center pawn.

1365,34,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np2p1/4p3/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Developing another piece.  Unlike with Joe it'll remain developed but TA knows more theory which is why does extremely well.
1366,34,8,f5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3bp/2np2p1/4pp2/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Unlike with Joe's other opponents I don't consider any moves by Ken pointless since I know him.  There's always a good reason but sometimes I don't know the logic.  This one of those times.  Instead of advancing the weakest pawn on the board I would've developed my Ng8.  Now for some reason it can't be as good but what I don't understand is what would happen if black played 6...Nf6 at once.
1367,34,9,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3bp/2np1np1/4pp2/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But now Ken continues to develop.
1368,34,10,Be6,b'r2qk2r/ppp3bp/2npbnp1/4pp2/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Completing his development and preparing to castle.
1369,34,11,Qd7,b'r3k2r/pppq2bp/2npbnp1/4pp2/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Preparing to castle Q side.  So there's something I'm missing because in this position I would've castled short at once.  Therefore my inference is that with the K side weakened (due to Ken's f pawn advancing) 9...0-0 would've left the monarch exposed.
1370,34,12,d5,b'r3k2r/pppq2bp/2n1bnp1/3ppp2/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I also don't why this was played.  It appears to leave Ken with a bad bishop.  Kind of premature to talk about it but this seems applicable to me in a blitz game.  The idea being is to play fast but accurately or lose as TA emphasized with the Q sacs.
1371,34,13,d4,b'r3k2r/pppq2bp/2n1bnp1/4pp2/3p4/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I knew that it was a matter of time before Ken would play this.

1376,34,18,1Nb1,b'r3kb1r/1ppq3p/p1n1bnp1/4pp2/3p4/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But this is a closed position since TA's are blocking the other pieces.  Therefore the N is worth more which is why he retreats back to b1.
1377,34,19,1Bd6,b'r3k2r/1ppq3p/p1nbbnp1/4pp2/3p4/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',After which Ken brings his DSB to a stronger outpost similar to what we see when black's N's are on the seventh rank (or visa versa) when white's Knight's are on the second rank.
1378,34,20,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/1ppq3p/p1nbbnp1/4pp2/3p4/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Going back to where it was after Ken attacks with his next move.
1379,34,21,h6,b'r3k2r/1ppq4/p1nbbnpp/5p2/3pp3/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"?? I'm not exactly sure why Ken played but according to Joe this loses which is why I gave it two queiries.  It's important to note that TA showed everyone two positions with the fen.  This was the first.  In it he said ""His weak pawn storming combined with his perplexed Knight moving only drew him in farther to my electrical storm."""
1380,34,22,1c3,b'r3k2r/1ppq4/p1nbbnpp/5p2/3pp3/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So Joe punishes Ken with this move.  The idea being c2-c3 followed by an eventual d3-d4 just like what we see in the Ruy Lopez when black plays ...Bc5  Although that wasn't played here it's still very applicable due to me exploring the mind of a senior master.
1381,34,23,1g5,b'r3k2r/1ppq4/p1nbbn1p/5pp1/3pp3/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The idea is preventing an exchange of pawns which is why Ken played this.

1383,34,25,2d4,b'r3k2r/1ppq4/p1nbbn1p/5pp1/3Pp3/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the same c2-d4 plan.  Usually it's done to get a pawn chain.  Therefore I don't understand the logic quite as well since it's an exchange is going to occur starting with the en-pessant capture.  And when Joe takes back Ken will castle long as noted on his 9th move.
1384,34,26,2a3,b'2kr3r/1ppq4/p1nbbn1p/5pp1/8/P2QP3/1P3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQ -',Preventing 22...Nb4 or 22...Bb4+

1387,34,29,2Qc6,b'2kr3r/1pp5/p1qbbn1p/4npp1/8/P3P3/1PQ2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ -',"So Ken goes for a Queen exchange which Joe will accept.  The idea being that without black's Queen on the board white will benefit.  As the saying goes ""Don't trust your opponent."""

That's another example of where I start to see the patterns and become familiar with theory.  In other words this is where it starts to become second nature to me.  With that being said I understand the logic behind this move since he's mobilizing his LSB where this covers more squares and it will turn out to be very damaging as we're about to see.

1424,35,0,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',This is a game I played a little while ago where I neglected the safety of my King - and paid the ultimate price for my folly. Listen close and pay heed for ultimately this - the safety of the kings - are the alpha and the omega of the game! So this then though a cautionary tale should not be read to mean that you should just cover in the corner like a frightened rabbit. Far from it! But it is better to attack from a strong position than from one riddled with weaknesses...
1425,35,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So I play the Sokolsky here - 1.b4. It is to put it mildly a somewhat uncommon opening choice. It is the 6th most common opening move here on GameKnot but considering the enormous preponderance of 1.e4 and 1.d4 that still translates to barely 1/2 of a percent of all games played.... Somewhat surprising actually as it is eminently playable. Anyway enough advertising! My esteemed opponent choses the standard reply here: e5.
1426,35,2,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',One of the hallmarks of the Sokolsky is this development of White's DSB (dark-squared Bishop). And indeed somewhat in contrast with other openings at his disposal White will often see his queenside developed a bit faster and easier than his kingside. Or stated differently: I need to be a bit careful with the safety of my King here as it is likely to remain in the center for a little while until I can get those other kingside pieces of the way. And the more so as I will almost invariably find myself castling short because the queenside is definitely unsafe now (after 1.b4).
1427,35,3,Bxe5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',I trade a flanking pawn for a center pawn and will now proceed to prove that this is to my advantage. Or that at least is the general idea...
1428,35,4,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Notice how Black is already ready and primed for castling while I have achieved nothing whatsoever on that front? In *principle* I may be correct in my claim that exchanging the b-pawn for a center pawn is a very good trade ... but Black has excellent compensation for that (minor) loss: my King is still far from safe and any kingside development will take quite some time yet.
1429,35,5,c4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1bP5/8/P2PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq c3',The GK engine claims this is a mistake (it prefers 4.a3 instead) claiming a Black advantage after 4.c4 O-O 5.Nc3 Ng4. But I don't intend to follow that line at all...
1430,35,6,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1bP5/P7/3PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQ -',Forcing Black to choose between keeping his Bishop on the a5 diagonal or retreating it towards e7. The position requires this (the alternative would give Black good attacking prospects on the kingside) but notice something? I still haven't developed a single kingside piece while Black is all set to start brawling! Yes I do have some advantage in the form of space and mobility but that kingside is already causing me plenty of grief.
1431,35,7,f4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4B3/2P2P2/P7/2QPP1PP/RN2KBNR b KQ f3',"This may not be the most accurate move in the position; in general I should keep the f-pawn fixed on f2 in order to keep my kingside as sturdy as possibly. Now I will have to be on a constant lookout for bad things that might happen on h4 and f2. But on the plus side this does give me more space on the kingside making it a bit more difficult for Black to start something there and it anchors the Bishop while denying e5 for the enemy Knight. Black can hardly afford to trade the Bishop as 7...Nxe5 8.fxe5 Ne8 (where else?) looks pretty awful for him.

1433,35,9,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/8/2P2P2/P7/1BQPP1PP/RN2KBNR w KQ -',Throughout the whole game Black remains very conscious of the safety of his King. Though this move may feel a bit excessive (I have hardly any threats in that direction yet) the point here is just as much to create some 'luft' (air) around the King (thus preventing 8th rank mates) as it is to take away control of g5 from White. This makes it a very useful waiting move in many positions and indeed you will want to do something like this relatively early in the game for you will often find that it is far too late to do this once things actually starts heating up! If you play through some grandmaster games from the last 20 years or so you will find that this kind of move is very common quite early in the game! So pay heed and remember this - give your King a bit of 'luft' to avoid finding him strangled later on ...
1434,35,10,e4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/8/2P1PP2/P7/1BQP2PP/RN2KBNR b KQ e3',Well that pawn needs to move somewhere or the Bishop on f1 is never going to go away ... and this does create a rather impressive center presence! On the other hand if you pointed out that my center is actually a bit shaky (those 4th rank pawns have little or no actual support) and that Black's position is quite solid you would be quite correct in that too ...
1435,35,11,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/8/2P1PP2/P7/1BQP2PP/RN2KBNR w KQ -',A good tip: always move your rooks so they can take advantage of open and half-open files. Like Black is doing here.

Doing it earlier would have been a mistake as I might then have used my advantage of space of mobility to threaten his King and win additional tempi - and more force to my attack. Now the tables are nicely turned - my King is still in the center and finding himself more and more exposed by every move ...
1437,35,13,Nxd5,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1bpp1/2n4p/3n4/4PP2/P2P4/1BQ3PP/RN2KBNR w KQ -',I have neglected the safety of my King and now I am starting to pay the price. Opening the e-file with that rook pointing straight down the throat of my exposed King would be sheer suicide now. 12.exd5 Bb4+ 13.Kf2 (13.Kd1 Re1#) 13...Qe7 14.Qc1 Bc5+ 15.d4 Nxd4 and things just go downhill from there...

The GK analysis engine gives Black a rather impressive +2 pt advantage here based purely on the positional aspects of the position (meaning: my exposed King!) Or rather after this move - which is a blunder quite in its own right - Black's advantage is actually more like 4½ pt! (due to lines like 12.Ne2 Ndb4 13.axb4 Nxb4 14.Qc3 Nxd3+ 15.Kd1 Nxb2+ etc.) Luckily for me he misses this - though more to the point so do I too or I would have moved 12.Nf3 instead! The idea behind the Ne2 move is rather simple: I need to shield my King from that rook on e8 and now the Knight has to move away from d5. It still would have been better to do Nf3 followed by Be2 however as then I could at least have castled ... which would really have proven a big big help later on!
1439,35,15,Ng4,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1bpp1/2n4p/8/4PPn1/P2P4/1BQNN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',So notice how f2 is really really weak now that the f-pawn has moved away to f4? Like it's a great big ugly gaping hole in my kingside position!? Well that's what happens when you move those f-pawns away and then allow your King to just stand there ...

But only because Black really missed his big chance after 12.Ne2 ... and though I do get some rather active play against the weakness in his own kingside now (namely: the long diagonal pointing straight at g7) that just means that for now the position is roughly even. If my King had been tucked safely away as it ought to have been I could have claimed a solid lead ...
1442,35,18,1h3,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1bpp1/2n2n1p/8/4PP2/P1QP3P/1B1NN1P1/R3KB1R b KQ -',Creates a new weakness on g3 and weakens h4 even more. But it does have the advantage of taking away g4 from the enemy Knight - as long as he does not simply sacrifice it and follow up with tactics based on the h4 check! More things to worry about and keep track of ... It is quite possible that simply castling long would have been significantly better all in all: that at least would have brought the King away from the threats on the e-file and activated the rather moribound Rook on a1 (with the additional bonus of actual threats against Black's Queen too).

If White had some pawns in place on  say a2 and b2 then castling long would have been a no-brainer. As it is a long castle would simply exchange an extremely unsafe position for a very shaky one: better but not really good.

But guess what? Those holes and weaknesses around my King - the consequence of stupidly letting him stay put in the center - they make the whole idea impossible! 17.e5? Nd5! 18.Qc2 Qh4+! 19.Kd1 Ne3+ and I might as well resign.

And now 18.exd5 Bxd5 19.O-O-O Bxh1 20.d5 Qf6 (forced or mate on g7) 21.Qxf6 gxf6 22.dxc6 Bxc6 would mean playing against his pair of Bishops in a very open position - which would clearly favour him.

GK correctly flags this as an 'inaccuracy' and gives this very instructive line as the alternative. It's probably not entirely correct (the GK analyses gets less precise towards their end) but the general idea is clear - and it shows again very clearly the consequences of having literally no protections in place around the King: here it let's Black get out of what would otherwise have been a hopeless bind. 19.Bg2 Na5 20.d5 Bd7 21.e5 Nxd5 22.Qxd5 Bc6 23.Qxa5 Bxg2 24.exd6 Bxh1 25.dxc7 Qh4+ 26.Kd1 Qxh3

GK evaluates his advantage to +2.75 but that is definitely too low.

1566,39,32,1Nb5,b'3rr1k1/ppp2p1p/1n3qp1/1N1Pbb2/8/1Q2B1P1/PP3PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',He attacks a7.
1567,39,33,1a6,b'3rr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn3qp1/1N1Pbb2/8/1Q2B1P1/PP3PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',So I defend and hit the knight.
1568,39,34,1Nd4,b'3rr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn3qp1/3Pbb2/3N4/1Q2B1P1/PP3PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',The knight takes up a more central role.
1569,39,35,1Bc8,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn3qp1/3Pb3/3N4/1Q2B1P1/PP3PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',And my bishop drops back freeing my Nb6.
1570,39,36,1f4,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn3qp1/3Pb3/3N1P2/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - f3',He hits the other bishop.
1571,39,37,1Bd6,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1qp1/3P4/3N1P2/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',Which drops back.
1572,39,38,2f5,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1qp1/3P1P2/3N4/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',And he continues his king side advances threatening f5xg6 and discovering an attack on my queen. I can answer that with Qxg6 but then it means my king side pawns are isolated and weaker. My computer likes simply capturing on f5 now with the pawn but I felt this left my king side pawns rather weak and isolated. 20...Bxf5 is playable too. 21. g4 doesn't win a piece as black has 21....Qe7 braking the pin and attacking Be3. White can get the pawn back immediately with	Bxf5 21. Nxf5 gxf5 22.	Bxb6	cxb6 23. Qxb6.
1573,39,39,2g5,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1q2/3P1Pp1/3N4/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',Perhaps this is chickening out but it does keep the king side closed.
1574,39,40,2Nf3,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1q2/3P1Pp1/8/1Q2BNP1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',And now his knight which started out as his queen side knight now takes up the position usually taken by this king side knight! Computer says this is the best move for white in this position.
1575,39,41,2g4,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1q2/3P1P2/6p1/1Q2BNP1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',The pawn was attacked so it advances again. Computer likes this move too.
1576,39,42,2Bd4,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b1q2/3P1P2/3B2p1/1Q3NP1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',He attacks my queen with tempo.
1577,39,43,2Qh6,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b3q/3P1P2/3B2p1/1Q3NP1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',This seems the best square for the queen.
1578,39,44,2Nh4,b'2brr1k1/1pp2p1p/pn1b3q/3P1P2/3B2pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',His attacked knight advances.
1579,39,45,2Nd7,b'2brr1k1/1ppn1p1p/p2b3q/3P1P2/3B2pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',And I reposition my knight to a more central location. Computer likes this move.
1580,39,46,2f6,b'2brr1k1/1ppn1p1p/p2b1P1q/3P4/3B2pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',He advances again.
1581,39,47,2Be5,b'2brr1k1/1ppn1p1p/p4P1q/3Pb3/3B2pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',I am trying to exchange bishops and hopefully win the pawn on f6. Computer prefers Ne5.
1582,39,48,2Be3,b'2brr1k1/1ppn1p1p/p4P1q/3Pb3/6pN/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',He avoids the exchange and attacks my queen.
1583,39,49,2Qf8,b'2brrqk1/1ppn1p1p/p4P2/3Pb3/6pN/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',My queen drops back.
1584,39,50,2Bg5,b'2brrqk1/1ppn1p1p/p4P2/3Pb1B1/6pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',And he re-enforces the pawn on f6.
1585,39,51,2h6,b'2brrqk1/1ppn1p2/p4P1p/3Pb1B1/6pN/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',I decide to attack his bishop. He now comes up with a combination that I hadn't seen. Computer prefers 26...Qc5+
1586,39,52,2Ng6,b'2brrqk1/1ppn1p2/p4PNp/3Pb1B1/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Of course! If I take the knight 28. f7+ is very strong. 
1587,39,53,2Qd6,b'2brr1k1/1ppn1p2/p2q1PNp/3Pb1B1/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',27....Ac5+ can be met with Be3 but that may have been marginally better than what I played.
1588,39,54,2Ne7+,b'2brr1k1/1ppnNp2/p2q1P1p/3Pb1B1/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',So he throws in a check. It may be best just to give up the exchange here but white is winning easily no matter what. Cartainly black has to avoid 28..... Kf8?? 29. Bxh6 mate. 28....Kh7 Qd3+ looks pretty grim for black too.
1589,39,55,2Nf5,b'2brr2k/1ppn1p2/p2q1P1p/3PbNB1/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',This is another strong move by white attacking my queen. I should have taken the queens off with Qb6+ here. Black is still losing but black is crushed in the game.
1590,39,56,2Qc5+,b'2brr2k/1ppn1p2/p4P1p/2qPbNB1/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',So I throw in this check instead. 
1591,39,57,3Be3,b'2brr2k/1ppn1p2/p4P1p/2qPbN2/6p1/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Bishop comes back with tempo.
1592,39,58,3Qf8,b'2brrq1k/1ppn1p2/p4P1p/3PbN2/6p1/1Q2B1P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',30....Qb5 trying to exchange queens was probably stronger.
1593,39,59,3Bxh6,b'2brrq1k/1ppn1p2/p4P1B/3PbN2/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Finally the pawn goes.
1594,39,60,3Qg8,b'2brr1qk/1ppn1p2/p4P1B/3PbN2/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',I felt safer having my queen near the king for protection but it is an illusion in fact the queen takes up a valuable flight square for the king. 31...Qc5+ was better.
1595,39,61,3Bg7+,b'2brr1qk/1ppn1pB1/p4P2/3PbN2/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',He throws in a check. I see that I am losing my queen but I decide to at least get two pieces for her.
1596,39,62,3Kh7,b'2brr1q1/1ppn1pBk/p4P2/3PbN2/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',So my king comes up.
1597,39,63,3Nh6,b'2brr1q1/1ppn1pBk/p4P1N/3Pb3/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Checkmate to the black queen! 33. Qe3 threatening mate was perhaps even stronger but both moves win for white.
1598,39,64,3Qxg7,b'2brr3/1ppn1pqk/p4P1N/3Pb3/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',I take the bishop.
1599,39,65,3fxg7,b'2brr3/1ppn1pPk/p6N/3Pb3/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',He takes her. 
1600,39,66,3Kxh6,b'2brr3/1ppn1pP1/p6k/3Pb3/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',I take the knight.
1601,39,67,3d6,b'2brr3/1ppn1pP1/p2P3k/4b3/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 b - -',Opening up the diagonal for his queen to come in.
1602,39,68,3Bxg7,b'2brr3/1ppn1pb1/p2P3k/8/6p1/1Q4P1/PP4BP/3R1RK1 w - -',"Played to reach the time control. Black's position is hopeless. By the time all the other games were over. We had lost the match heavily. Rather than put the clocks back 15 minutes each I decided to resign.
