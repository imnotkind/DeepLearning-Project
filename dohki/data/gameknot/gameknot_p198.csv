Nh5 is most often played here but I decided to get out of the book on this move in the hope that my opponent would castle short since White is angling for a kingside attack...as Sun Tzu says ""If I am able to determine the opponent's dispositions while at the same time I conceal my own then I can concentrate and he must divide.  And if I concentrate while he divides I can use my entire strength to attack a fraction of his.  There I will be numerically superior.  Then if I am able to use many to strike few at a selected point those I deal with will be in dire straits...For if he does not know where I intend to give battle he must prepare in a great many places.  And when he prepares in a great many places those I have to fight in any one place will be few.  For if he prepares to the front his rear will be weak and if to the rear his front will be fragile.  If he prepares to the left his right will be vulnerable and if to the right there will be few on his left.  And when he prepares everywhere he will be weak everywhere...Therefore determine the opponent's plans and you will know which strategy will be successful and which will not"" (ibid. 6:13-15 20)."

Another intesting point is that now that the Bg3 Nb4 king/castle fork (which I am personaly fond of) is no longer available blacks knight is not so good.  He cant really play Na6 because all he can do from there is go back to b8 or goto b4 which as I said isn't really viable anymore.  His other option is Nd7 a terrible move that bottles up his Queen and WSB.  My point is that from 3 moves in black is already positionally hampered and that I love a strategic game."

Here is yet another awesome performance from the Master Mater against the extremely unfortunate Master Bastalex who resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  My own tactical play is very hit and miss at the moment and there is much room for improvement so I hope I can spot some tactics and hidden tactics in this one.  Freddy starts off with the Reti Opening where he brings his knight out to f3 straight away.  This move holds back 1. ..... e4 so black usually plays d5 in this position.  The Reti usually transposes into a QP opening or even occasionally a Sicilian should black respond c5.  In this game Master Bastalex responds with d5."
184,6,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',2. c4!? - interesting move - Freddy just lurves gambits!  The purpose of this move is to divert the d5 pawn on to c4 where it can be recaptured after playing 1. e4.  Master Bastalex however declines the gambit and responds with c6 which has shades of the Slav Defense in the Queen's Gambit Declined.
185,6,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3..... Nf6 - development.

187,6,4,Bxc4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',7. Bxc4 - pawn trade - note the d4 pawn prevents black from expanding by playing Nc5 or Ne5.

190,6,7,1Na4,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1pn2/8/Np1PP3/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',10. Na4 - on the rim but probably not for long!

192,6,9,Ndf6,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/8/Np1Pn3/5N2/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',11. ..... Ndf6 - Master Bastalex now supports his advanced steed with Nf6.  Hmm wonder where his light square bishop is going?
193,6,10,1Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/8/Np1Pn3/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',12. Bd3 - putting the question to that advanced knight.  Black answers with Nd6.  Note that there is a line up of WQ and white lsb on the b1-h7 diagonal.  That means a knight must remain on f6 to avoid some nasty checks on h7.
194,6,11,Bb7,b'r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p1pnpn2/8/Np1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',13. ..... Bb7 - black answers my question re this bishop he places it on b7.

With the queen side looking rather draughty I would hesitate to put Henry on that side hmm I know Freddy usually gets him in the end but why make it Easy for him!
197,6,14,1Bg3,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnp3/2Nn4/1p1P4/3B1NB1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',16. Bg3 - Freddy's dsb sidesteps the black knight.  Interestingly enough white is in a position to play Bxh7 after black responds with Nb5 but it is not a good move can you the jury see why?
198,6,15,1Be5,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqp1p3/1nNnB3/1p1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',17. Be5 - Freddy's pieces take up more aggressive posts although I suppose black could play f6 here (I wonder why not?) but it is his knight that goes to f6 and not the pawn.
199,6,16,Nd5,b'2r1kb1r/1b3ppp/pqp1p3/1nNnB3/1p1P4/1Q1B1N2/PP3PPP/R1R3K1 w k -',19. ....... Nd5 - interesting the knight goes back to d5.

202,6,19,fxe6,b'2r1kb1r/1b4p1/pqpnp2p/2NnB3/Pp1P4/1Q1B4/1P3PPP/R1R3K1 w k -',22. .... fxe6 - black accepts the sacrifice but now Freddy shows the point of it by bringing his bishop over to g6 with check.  Black now loses the right to castle.  That e6 pawn looks really vulnerable to a move like Nxe6.
203,6,20,Qa7,b'2rk1b1r/qb4p1/p1pnp1Bp/P1NnB3/1p1P4/1Q6/1P3PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',24. ...... Qa7 - Black's queen takes on a Glenda-like (defensive!) position.  For the benefit of any new members of the Inquest Jury my king is called Henry and my queen is called Glenda and my bishops are called Fou Leblanc and Fou Lenoir because of the light and dark squares they stand on!  Anyhow back to Freddy's game that vulnerable e6 pawn now drops off.  Although Freddy is a whole piece down he has an overwhelming position. 
204,6,21,2Qh3,b'2r2b1r/qb1k2p1/p1pnN1Bp/P2nB3/1p1P4/7Q/1P3PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',26. Qh3 - at last Freddy's queen goes to the kingside with devastating effect.  Just for starties Freddy is threatening a nasty discovered check with his knight.  Black completes his development on Move 26 would you believe but it will avail him naught.
205,6,22,2Rac1,b'b1r4r/q2kb1p1/p1pnN1Bp/P1RnB3/1p1P4/7Q/1P3PPP/2R3K1 b - -',28. Rac1 - here come the rooks carrion methinks!

207,6,24,3Ng5+,b'b1r4r/q2kb1p1/p2n2Bp/P2pB1N1/1p6/7Q/1P3PPP/2R3K1 b - -',31. Ng5+ - now comes the discovery.
208,6,25,3Nf7+,b'b1rk3r/q3bNp1/p2n2Bp/P2pB3/1p6/7Q/1P3PPP/2R3K1 b - -',"32. Nf7+ - here Master Bastalex waves the white flag despite being 5 whole material points up why well here is Variation A.  32. Nf7+ Nxf7 33. Rxc8#.  Now for Variation B.  32. Nf7+ Ke8 
33. Nxd6+ Kf8 
34. Qxc8+ Bd8 
35. Qxd8# .   And here is Variation C - 32. Nf7+ Ke8 
33. Nxd6+ Kd8 
34. Rxc8# 

So for the second time Master Bastalex because of his esteemed Master Status has been allowed to avoid being Freddied by resignation lucky him.  Anyhow well played Freddy!

390,15,26,g6,b'8/7k/6p1/6Kp/8/8/8/8 w - -',The killer move. Now Black wins easily and I resigned. I thought this was a very sharp game with good attacking lines on both sides down the Queenside. The doubled black pawn ended up destroying my position and forcing me onto the defensive although I still had some counterplay. I had to be very sharp on the defensive because of numerous threats and almost managed to salvage the game. OldGus says that I had some strong attacks and felt this was winning or draw for White but I could not find the moves.

This is a common pawn formation in the KID so I doubt that Black has made his decisive error yet but his position deteriorates fast now so look out for errors over the next few moves.  White applies a vice to the position.

537,23,24,c4,b'8/8/7k/3R4/K1p4P/Pr1p4/8/8 w - -',Skönt att han inte slog min c-bonde för nu blir det jämnare fighting. För tillfället kan vit inte slå någon av mina pjäser utan att förlora material. Bra !

549,23,36,Kf4,b'8/8/8/PK6/5k2/8/8/r7 w - -',Med tungan rätt i mun så kan remi undvikas. Borde nog ha gått till f5 istället för det här leder till remi. Justja avlägsen opposition hade varit det rätta draget. På f5 så hade våra K stått med tre rutor emellan och är antalet rutor udda så är det opposition.
550,23,37,Kd6,b'8/8/PK1k4/8/8/8/8/r7 w - -',Än aning försenad opposition som antagligen endast kan åstadkomma remi. Fast med tanke på vits stora övertag i mittspelet så är remi inte så illa pinkat.
551,23,38,6a7,b'8/P7/1K1k4/8/8/8/8/r7 b - -',Vi försenar hans promobonde med schack och det kan även vara en vändpunkt till min fördel.
552,23,39,6Rb1+,b'8/P7/1K1k4/8/8/8/8/1r6 w - -',Nu måste han sätta sin K i säkerhet och det sker antagligen på a6. Då kan jag skära av hans väg på c7 och promar han då så har jag en skåvare med T på a1.

557,23,44,6Kb8,b'NK6/8/2k5/8/8/8/8/r7 b - -',Undviker att han repeterar dragen genom att gå med T till f1. Då kan inte parera med S mot någon ruta på rad 8.
