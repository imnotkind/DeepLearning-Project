0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  Just to say that I had a narrow squeak against wakefire who played very well and my position had the worrying hallmark of a jstevens1 game - passive but just about able to hold things together.  My passed c pawn saved the day and prompted my opponent's draw offer which I gratefully accepted!  Cheers.  Joanne
1,0,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. c3 - a c3 Sicilian.
2,0,2,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nnP4/2p1p3/8/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',8. 0-0 - Henry is tucked away but I will have to develop my queenside somehow and the d6 pawn will soon drop off.
3,0,3,1Qxd3,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/1nnb4/4p3/8/2PQ1N2/PPB2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',11. Qxf3 - the start of a queenside liberation process.
4,0,4,Bxd8,b'3bk2r/pp3ppp/1nn5/4p3/6b1/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNB3K1 w k -',14. ............. Bxd8 - two major pieces have been exchanged but I must develop my queenside.
5,0,5,1Be4,b'3bk2r/pp3ppp/1nn5/4p3/4B1b1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB3K1 b k -',15. Be4 - to avoid my kingside pawns being busted but still my knight and Frere Lenoir are at home!
6,0,6,1Kg2,b'4k2r/ppb2pp1/1nn3p1/4p3/6P1/2P2N1P/PP3PK1/RNB5 b k -',19. Kg2 - forced to prevent Rxh3 and guess what the knight and Frere Lenoir are still at home!
7,0,7,2Na3,b'4k2r/ppb2pp1/2n3p1/3np3/6P1/N1P2N1P/PP3PK1/R1B5 b k -',20. Na3 - movement of that comatose queenside back row at last!
8,0,8,2Bd2,b'4k2r/ppb3p1/2n2pp1/3np3/6P1/N1P2N1P/PP1B1PK1/R7 b k -',21. Bd2 - and now Frere Lenoir flies the coup!
9,0,9,2Ne2,b'4r3/ppb2kp1/2n2p2/3n2p1/4p1P1/2P4P/PPNBNPK1/4R3 b - -',25. Ne2 - have spent the last few moves on trying to centralise my pieces at least the knights are not dim on the rim!  Black still has the edge though.
10,0,10,2Ncd4,b'4r3/ppb2kp1/5p2/3nn1p1/3Np1P1/2P4P/PP1BNPK1/4R3 b - -',26. Ncd4 - a white centralised knight - whoppee doo!
11,0,11,2Nd4,b'4r3/ppb2kp1/5p2/3n4/3Np1Pp/2P4P/PP1B1PK1/4R3 b - -',29. Nd4 - not much has changed except that one pair of knights have been exchanged and black has undoubled his pawns.  The only good thing is that the black h pawn provides shelter from hostile castle fire for my own as he cannot take his own pawn.
12,0,12,Bb8,b'1b2r3/pp1n1k2/5pp1/1N6/2P1p1Pp/1P5P/P2B1PK1/4R3 w - -',32. ....... Bb8 - if Bb6?? then black will drop the exchange to Nd6 
13,0,13,3Nd5,b'4r3/1p3k2/p7/3Nnp2/2P1p2p/1P5P/P4PK1/4R3 b - -',38. Nd5 - gives an illusion of equality but black's central pawns and his knight and rook will soon start to put me under pressure.
14,0,14,4bxc4,b'3r4/5k2/p7/3N1p2/2P1p2p/3n3P/P1R2P2/5K2 b - -',42. bxc4 - I must retake with the pawn else the knight on d5 drops.
15,0,15,4Rc3,b'3r4/5k2/8/p2N4/2P1pp1p/P1Rn3P/5P2/5K2 b - -',44. Rc3?! - my opponent pointed out that f3 would have been better here!
16,0,16,Rb8,b'1r6/5k2/8/p2N4/2P1p2p/P2n1p1P/2R2P2/5K2 w - -',45. ......... Rb8 - suddenly I feel a dark shadow and some cold fetid breath right over me.  Yup it is the chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey and I am in his shadow all right.  Black is threatening mate in two.  Kg1 stops the mate because Henry will have a flight square on h2.
17,0,17,Rb8,b'1r6/5k2/8/p2N4/2P1p2p/P2n1p1P/2R2P2/5K2 w - -',49. .......... Rb8 - after a manoeuvering of the pieces we have a repetition of the position on black's 45th move and there is a draw offer!  I accept the draw offer with a sigh of relief.  After the match my opponent sent me a pm telling me he was a little worried about my passed c pawn which had some influence over the draw offer.  Hence thank heaven for little pawns!   Could black have improved on this.  You the jury decide.  Joanne
18,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Blitz chess is more about winning economically (without super-long thinks or analysis) than about calculating variations.  It often highlights my lack of imagination in creating tactical chances for myself.  But I managed to do alright here.
19,1,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Philidor's defense.  Sound but pretty passive.  I decide to go for quick development and hope to blow open black's king's defenses in short order.
20,1,2,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',The most aggressive recapture although not necessarily better than Nxd4.  This entices black to play Nc6.
21,1,3,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Forcing Bxc6 to justify 4. Qxd4 other options force the queen to move again.
22,1,4,Bg5,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/6B1/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Trying to provoke kingside weaknesses.
23,1,5,Be7,b'r2qk1nr/ppp1bppp/2bp4/6B1/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',A little unexpected.  This allows white to exchange away black's advantage (the two bishops) while maintaining a lead in development.
24,1,6,Bxe7,b'r2qk1nr/ppp1Bppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',A safe option but Qxg7 was stronger.
25,1,7,Qxe7,b'r3k1nr/ppp1qppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',At this point white could still play Qxg7 (I saw it at this point) but I deemed it too risky.  It looks like it wins a pawn and possibly more but Black's retort Qxe4  is very strong.
26,1,8,Nc3,b'r3k1nr/ppp1qppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',So here's a safer option now.  White still has a (very small) lead in development and space but Black is very close to being equal.
27,1,9,O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/ppp1qppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Making trouble for my queen?
28,1,10,1O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/ppp1qppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',And answering in kind.  We're going to have a battle in the center of the board; I'm ready for it.
29,1,11,1Nh6,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2bp3n/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',?!  I spotted this immediately as a weak move.  It develops the knight away from where the action is.  How to capitalize?
30,1,12,1Rhe1,b'2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2bp3n/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',Load up in the center.  Qxg7 was again possibly a better option as black's knight would be in big trouble.  Missed that one though.
31,1,13,1b6,b'2kr3r/p1p1qppp/1pbp3n/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - -',Preparing a hidey-hole for the bishop?  Still overlooks Qxg7.
32,1,14,1Qc4,b'2kr3r/p1p1qppp/1pbp3n/8/2Q1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',As do I although this move has the benefit of allowing e5 without fear of my queen falling under his rook's threat.
33,1,15,1e5,b'2kr3r/pbp1qppp/1p1p3n/4P3/2Q5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',A reasonable thrust into the center.  Black's queen has a revealed attack coming on her.
34,1,16,1dxe5,b'2kr3r/pbp1qppp/1p5n/4p3/2Q5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - -',Better than d5 which gets refuted by Nxd5.
35,1,17,1Nxe5,b'2kr3r/pbp1qppp/1p5n/4N3/2Q5/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - -',Rxe5 was also good and very direct but I felt that this exerted more pressure by giving black the opportunity to blunder.
36,1,18,1Qg5+,b'2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1p5n/4N1q1/2Q5/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - -',Seems like a good way to avoid the revealed threat on e7...
37,1,19,1f4,b'2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1p5n/4N1q1/2Q2P2/2N5/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b - f3',!  My only really good move of the game!  It forces the queen to an awkward square and offers the tempting diversion Qxg2 which takes the queen out of play for a move.
38,1,20,1Qxg2,b'2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1p5n/4N3/2Q2P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KRR3 w - -',?!  I was expecting Qf6 defending the f7 square and keeping the queen relatively centralized.
39,1,21,1Nxf7,b'2kr3r/pbp2Npp/1p5n/8/2Q2P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KRR3 b - -',Black's got to do something to avoid losing the exchange.
40,1,22,1Rxd1+,b'2k4r/pbp2Npp/1p5n/8/2Q2P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KrR3 w - -',Reasonable.
41,1,23,1Rxd1,b'2k4r/pbp2Npp/1p5n/8/2Q2P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KR4 b - -',I think this is the best recapture here as it cuts the king off from the center of the board.  With the pawn on f7 gone Qe6  is a menacing idea.
42,1,24,1Qxf7,b'2k4r/pbp2Qpp/1p6/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KR4 b - -',After all the bloodshed am I no better than even?  Indeed.  At least I'm a little deeper into his territory than he is into mine.  Nb5 looks dangerous too.
43,1,25,1Rd8,b'2kr4/pbp2Qpp/1p6/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KR4 w - -',?!  And this allows a forced mate.  I'm turning it into an (easy) puzzle.  Can you find the solution?
44,1,26,1Qe6+,b'2kr4/pbp3pp/1p2Q3/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KR4 b - -',(Qf5 is also worth full credit.)
45,1,27,1Kb8,b'1k1r4/pbp3pp/1p2Q3/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3qP/2KR4 w - -',Or Rd7 20. Qe8  with mate to follow.

* * * * * * *
Each of three games played by Eric and I have opened with 1.e4 with my Black Defenses being this French and an Accelerated Dragon. His Black was the Ruy Lopez Berlin Variation (3...Nf6 without playing ...a6 there). Each game has been highly interesting to me and theoretical yet displaying new ideas. 

I think this game was really quite the clash both tactical and theoretical. And why shouldn't it be? The WT player is a highly rated otb FM and author of a book on the French Defense that was so important as to overturn the assessment of another BL mainline making it practically (or more likely ""actually unplayable..."") unplayable for BL. And BL is a specialist in the French Defense then at the peak of his game with performance results exceeding 2400 at this point of career in the French. And BL has a new move begging to be tried which fortuitously is in the very variation that WT is begging to try! This is a real slugfest of a game so bear in mind also that it is played at a time when computers were dogs and could not beat a well prepared Class postalite or likely even survive! 
If you are wondering why Eric was Expert at the time well I do too. Just from the games he and I have played it is clear he has high Master level knowledge of the game positionally as well as tactically. (The Sicilican we played makes clear his positional abililty to not only play ""the rules"" but at a higher level as well and play the ""exceptions"".) And is a very aggressive player as well. I suspect that he was giving up some potential rating points in a quest to get into lines he wished to try out perhaps for publication in his works.
I never asked but that is my theory. And besides that the game & ratings are from APCT which was a very strong USA organization; probably the strongest if one goes by the results of the 1st National Team Championship where APCT finished a solid first place ahead of USCF CCLA & others. Anyway I do hope you enjoy the game!  }8-) Craig

Most common now and objectively stongest IMO is 4.e5 which leads me most often into the mainline Poisoned Pawn Var. of 4...c5 (or 4...Ne7) 5.a3 Bxc3  6.bxc3 Ne7 (or ...Qc7 or even ...Nf5 if Ne7 previously played.) then 7.Qg4 and BL would now sac his g & h pawns to play against WT's center pawns immediately instead. If I had the WT pieces that is. 
     Sometimes I will vary with 4.Nge2 de4 5.a3 line in which Black can try to hold his extra pawn or else give it back instead and spend his time bolstering his own center which can then become a good one. 
     Or I might try the line with 4.e5 c5 5.Bd2 sometime tho i have not yet done it in a rated corr. game. 
      The other lines for WT I am not very impressed with although the one with 4.Qg4 seems solid enough it is hardly enterprising imo. And Fischers postitional line without Qg4 which plays Nf3 instead does not suit my abilities nor inclinations well.

Insofar as the game I doubt either of us looked much at playing those particulars and would not have thought to insult the other or mar a well fought game by playing thru hopeless lines from the weaker side whoever had it in a particular game.

Blocks the diagonal but White is also restricting his queenside development... his dark-squared bishop can only go to d2 which would only give his knight the unappealing Na3.

White never intended Bg5 and white's ideas lie not only in the f4 push but also in Be3 so if the bishops were traded white would have a nice semi-open file to work on. ...h6 of course also weakens the kingside slightly and considering that black should be aware that the kingside is where white wants to play doesn't make much sense.
328,18,10,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p1npbn1p/2b1p3/4P3/2NPBNPP/PPP2PBK/R2Q1R2 b - -',Tempting the trade which of course is not forced; 11.Bxc5?! may be bad because black would have its own semi-open file for its heavy peices and strong control over the d4 square. Notice that the resulting c5 pawn would not be a weakness mainly because white has no effective way of threatening it.

331,18,13,1Nh4,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pp1/p1npbn1p/4p3/4P2N/2NPP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 b - -',The f5 square is weak so white quickly decides to plant a strong knight there with strong threats against the king.
332,18,14,1Nh7,b'r4rk1/1ppq1ppn/p1npb2p/4p3/4P2N/2NPP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 w - -',Black already has a difficult position but this move cannot help. Perhaps black wanted to advance its pawn to f5 but this idea can't be good because then after exf5 the white bishop on g2 is very strong. Quickly looking at this my considerations would have been in ...Kh8 or ...Ne7 trying to bring the peices in their more useful defensive squares for white's coming assault.
333,18,15,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/1ppq1ppn/p1npb2p/3Np3/4P2N/3PP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 b - -',I liked this move and played it without much calculation. My thinking was simple ...Bxd5 is bad because now the white bishop may use the e4 square as a pivot point to aim at the kingside and since the ...h6 move earlier in the game weakened black's white kingside squares trading its best piece that defends them doesn't sound logical. Here I was expecting ...Ne7 putting the question to my centralized knight but instead I got...

This must have been why black wasted two tempi moving its knight to this square but considering white has an effective move to stop this idea and continue on its own plan black's plan was simply wrong. Although it may not look like it understanding this position should clearly show that the white player has the the only kingside initiative and that black has to be very careful before its position becomes hopeless.
335,18,17,1Nf5,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pp1/p1npb2p/3NpNn1/4P3/3PP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 b - -',Once again any capture of either knight will only improve white's position. And once again because of black's careless ...h6 now not even ...g6 can be played because of the hanging h6 pawn. White's knights are currently worth more than the rooks because of how they invade into black's territory.
336,18,18,1Bxd5,b'r4rk1/1ppq1pp1/p1np3p/3bpNn1/4P3/3PP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 w - -',Black decides that the d5 knight was more troublesome when in truth the f5 knight in my opinion is stronger. Now black is completely helpless on its light squares and white should coordinate its forces on those weak squares to attack.
337,18,19,Na7,b'r4rk1/nppq1pp1/p2p3p/3PpNn1/8/3PP1PP/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 w - -',One mistake follows another. I don't believe Black understood how bad his position was because only ...Ne7 should have been considered. From a7 the knight only has 2 terrible squares to jump to -- b5 where it attacks nothing and c8 which doesn't need explanation as to how bad it would be there.
338,18,20,1h4,b'r4rk1/nppq1pp1/p2p3p/3PpNn1/7P/3PP1P1/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 b - -',This move is simple to find and very strong. The knight can't retreat and black will receive nothing in compensation for its peice defecit. For these reasons black could resign here but instead wants to be proven wrong...
339,18,21,1Nh7,b'r4rk1/nppq1ppn/p2p3p/3PpN2/7P/3PP1P1/PPP3BK/R2Q1R2 w - -',With the illusion that everything was ok. White has another very simple and very strong move that destroys Black....
340,18,22,1Qg4,b'r4rk1/nppq1ppn/p2p3p/3PpN2/6QP/3PP1P1/PPP3BK/R4R2 b - -',...And finally black realizes he is lost. Mate on g7 is threatened and if black thinks it can prevent it with any pawn move Nh6  wins the unprotected queen on d7. This is a good example of showing how one should exploit the weak squares that an opponent leaves unprotected to bring in the quick point with the greatest efficiency. 1-0

Hope you have enjoyed looking through Part 1 - I thought I would again try out the black side of the Fried Liver Attack against Ion (interestingly enough the rating differentials are similar here to the ones in the Fried Pt 1 Brandon game) to see if I could improve upon it.  No such luck!  Joanne

He lost but in the final position he had two rooks against a Q   2 pawns.  Hmm might have played on there.  Valeriuzaharia merely backed off his bishop to b3 but Ion had a much stronger continuation - 15.g4.  In retrospect I should have played h5 first to prevent g4 therefore preparing b5.

20. Nb4 threatens Rd1  skewering both majesties Henry   Glenda!  There is no time to get the rook out of the way so my rook on f7 drops for nothing.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag.

So should the move 5. ......... Nxd5 be awarded the chessic equivalent of the skull   crossbones (??).  You the jury decide.

424,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  Just dug out this game on the Fried Liver attack in which I played the black pieces.  This match took place in a leisure centre in Brandon Suffolk sometime in 1998.  I lost this game but it does throw open to debate how strong the Fried Liver Attack really is.
425,25,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3. ...... Nf6 - the Two Knights Defense - this leads to some interesting play.  Na5 is now the recommended move although it does leave black a pawn down.
426,25,2,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',5. ......... Nxd5 - it is this move that starts the Fried Liver Attack.  The formation of the black king knight and pawn clustered on d5 e5 and e6 in the middle of the board make it look like a lump of liver in a body!
427,25,3,Ke6,b'r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1k3/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',7. ...... Ke6 - Henry must go to e6 to protect his steed as black will be a pawn down otherwise.
428,25,4,1d4,b'r1bq1b1r/pp2n1pp/2p1k3/3np3/2BPQ3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ d3',10. d4 - nasty nasty the e5 pawn is pinned by the Wicked Witch of the West on e4!

430,25,6,1Bb3,b'r1bq1b1r/ppk3pp/1np5/4P3/4Q3/1B6/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',14. Bb3 - white does not wish his powerful lsb to be exchanged.
431,25,7,Kc8,b'r1kqbb1r/pp4pp/1np1P3/8/4QB2/1B6/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',16. ....... Kc8 - Henry finds some shelter on c8 but my a8 rook is boxed in.
432,25,8,Re8,b'r1k1r3/pp2b1pp/1npBPqb1/8/6Q1/1B6/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',20. ........ Re8 - I try and develop my pieces as quickly as possible.
433,25,9,Qxe6,b'r1k1r3/pp2b1pp/1npBq3/8/2P5/1B4Q1/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',23. Qxe6 - that white pawn has been removed from the board and a rook for a bishop has been exchanged but white's attack has not burned out!
434,25,10,Qf6,b'r1k1r3/pp2b1pp/1npB1q2/2P5/8/1B4Q1/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',24. ........ Qf6?? - I think here that I should have tried Bxd6 instead - if R Q or P captures Frere Lenoir then Glenda can give a check on e1 RxQ then RxR#!
435,25,11,Nd7,b'r1k1r3/pp1nb1pp/2pB1q2/2P5/6Q1/1B6/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',25. ........ Nd7 - I don't like walking into a discovery if Kd8 so I decide to block the queen check.
436,25,12,3Bxb6,b'r1k2r2/pp1n2pp/1Bp5/8/6Q1/1B6/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - -',30. Bxb6 - after blundering away my quen on move 26 trying to counterattack I decided to throw in the sponge as even though I can take the bishop on b6 white has the killer Qxd7  and I end up a Q and piece down for a rook without any counterplay.  So time to wave the white flag.  Hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne

Bd3 when the WB interferes with the Q's defence of d4 though at the moment I have enough defending d4 anyway.  One of the advantages of Nimzowitsch's theory of over-protection is that it provides mobility to each of the defenders: they can move without leaving their charge defenceless.  So given the choice I prefer not to interfere with the d pawn's defence.  Also the Be2 protects the Nf3 in the event the f-pawns come off.

Also I have had painful experience in the French of losing the d pawn and the whole position collapsing as a result ( though in some lines such as the Milner-Barry Gambit in the Advance White offers the d-pawn deliberately).  I spend most of the rest of this game considering moves and exchanges on d4 and their ramifications eventually gaining half an hour on the clock and winning material as a result.

What I don't like about the move is that it condemns the B to a pawn's role for much of the game its main duty being to blockade the potential monster on d5 and prevent discovered attacks by Black's Bb7.  What I like about the move s that is puts the B on the long black diagonal pointing at the squares around Black's K if I can free my e pawn by getting rid of Black's e pawn.
534,30,18,1Nc5,b'5rk1/pbq1br1p/1p2p1p1/2npP3/2pB1P2/2P3N1/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',I don't want to take this because Black's B will occupy c5 with check allowing the d pawn to advance and Black's Bishops will dominate the game.

I rather liked this solution giving up the otherwise fairly redundant bishop for his two pawns and allowing the N to defend f4 from h5 in an apparently threatening manner.  The question then arises whether I can exploit his exposed King position before he uses the half-open files to batter my King's position with his Rooks and Q.  I think it's an innovative move in a difficult position but probably not very sound!

Bg5 was recommended which would attack the Wicked Witch of the West.  However I played through the rest of that game and found that neither Experts noticed that white's b pawn was en prise for several moves.  As I thought that Frere Lenoir would only be driven back I thought it was a perfectly reasonable plan to put him on d2 and then put Glenda behind him on c1 and then play Frere Lenoir to h6.  White is fully developed and seems to have a reasonable position but Ion came up with a gem ....... f5!! driving my knight back after the pawns are exchanged on f5.

Nf4 - Ion decides to sac his knight - taking it will be suicide as it will allow a deadly check from his dsb on e5 and then Henry will have to retreat to g1 or h1 and then the Wicked Witch will take the pawn on h3 and then come in on g2 dealing death.  The only alternative to avoid dropping a pawn is the text but it only holds him off for another 7 moves.

Kh8 - here I wave the white flag on the grounds of unavoidable mate on g2 or h2 and there is no way I can try and get a perpetual with Glenda and my other rook all bottled up on the queenside.  A sorry end.  Hope you have enjoyed this lesson.  For further examples of this type of attack I would recommend you read J N Walker's Attack on the King which devotes a chapter to how locking up the centre can lead to mating attacks on the enemy king when you castle on the same side as your opponent.  If your opponent's pieces are locked in on the other side of the board you can afford to expose your king here.  A cautionary tale however is that if the centre is not locked then you may be punished for moving pawns in front of your castled king as Glenda has netted a few lower rated victims that way!  Anyhow I will not give up the fight one day I will get my first half point against an Expert!  Unitl then I will keep smiling.  Cheers - Joanne
