The only other time that playing badly works is when your rating is much higher then your opponents rating.  Then you can try different things and put the basics aside as I had mentioned earlier.

178,5,11,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppqn1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',This was the wrong one. I feared a counter attack by white with b3 opening the queenside thus moving the game on the side of the castled king. But I shouldn't. You'll see why.
179,5,12,h6,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/3bbn1p/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',The normal attack was Ng4 hitting h2... but after h3 it goes nowhere. Instead if I would have castled queenside after h3 I can confidently play the sac h5! and if hxN hxg would have recovered the piece and played a risky but strong attack. Now I realize that the only way to disrupt white's fortress is to throw in some pawns... uncovering my king. But no way: I cannot play without looking for an attack. And this move covers g5 which is good anyway. 
180,5,13,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/3bbn1p/8/2pPN3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Obvious since white has to untangle his pieces. I don't want my dsb to be exchanged so...
181,5,14,1Bxe4,b'r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/3bb2p/8/2pPB3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',...but remember: avoid to exchange piece when you have superior developement or you'll easily lose it. This way white owns a very nice diagonal and supports the lethal d5. I had to act quickly or the game will return to be even. So I dared pretty irresponsibly...
182,5,15,1f5,b'r4rk1/ppqn2p1/3bb2p/5p2/2pPB3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - f6',If d5 fxB dxB exNf3 exNd7 Bxh2+ and black has a winning attack. But I overlooked the simple 14. Bxb2! QxB RxBe6 (who has became undefended when the f pawn was moved!). Instead the more normal and calm Nf6 leads to 14. d5 Bd7. White has blocked his good white diagonal and he has to retire or exchange his lsb. It was not a bad result for me. So I played with enthusiasm more than calculation and this is a very common mistake at chess. 
183,5,16,1Bc2,b'r4rk1/ppqn2p1/3bb2p/5p2/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',White chooses to retire. Probably he is happy having my own f pawn blocking my lsb's action. And of course I have to take care of my lsb but this is not a problem:

186,5,19,1g5,b'r4rk1/ppqn4/3b3p/3b1pp1/2pP4/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - g6',I choosed the wrong way but as I said: all my game was based on a quick attack so I went for it. My own pieces although well placed are impotent without a pawn's break. And I have to count on a tempo loss to place the rook behind it as it should... and finally for beginners: this move opens the way for the white Queen to h5. And the white knight can go to e5 because if I exchange it I cannot retake the white pawn in e5 because I have to spend a tempo defending the bishop.
187,5,20,1Ne5,b'r4rk1/ppqn4/3b3p/3bNpp1/2pP4/2P4P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I suspect that white realized all that too :-D

Now I'm not sure it is convenient for me to open the files since my rook cannot move to the right place (g7) and I cannot exchange. I realized by now how different would have been my position having castled queenside - true is that probably white's moves would have been others.

It was in the fact that white has as a minimum Qd5+ and if black covers the check with the rook to avoid a subsequent BxRh7+ now in h6 the queen doesn't help to the defence of f7 as it does in e7. so QxR becomes possible for white.

364,13,11,2Qb2,b'r3r1k1/5pp1/p4n1p/1p1p1P2/1B1n1q2/4PP2/PQ5P/R3K2R b KQ -',Overwhelmed with choices here knight to f3 queen to f3 queen to e3.... I chose the rook in the end simply to continue a three piece attack rather than try and cope with the two over-reach and get thumped.
365,13,12,Qxf3+,b'r5k1/5pp1/p4n1p/1p1p1P2/1B1n4/4rq2/PQ5P/R4K1R w - -',I don't think going the other way would have made much difference at this point. But now he is stuffed. Its a forced move to g1 with the continuation K-e2 QxK RxQ then whatever move he makes he can't prevent Q-g2 mate. So being far more gentlemanly than I he acknowledges and resigns.
366,14,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I usually start with the Sicilian vs 1.e4
367,14,1,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',This is the point of the Sveshnikov. Black accepts a huge weakness on d5 hoping to compensate with dynamic play and the chance to push the white knight around while developing.
368,14,2,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Threatening nd6 which would be a bind.

372,14,6,1Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1Npp2/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now the best move here for black is probably Be6 (stopping exf5) and starting to work towards getting rid of the strong knight. But I figured my opponent knew this line pretty well and I decided to try my secret weapon!
373,14,7,1Qg5,b'r1b1kb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1Nppq1/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Boom! Completely unsound looks immediately losing doesn't it? Well it probably is but white has to be ultra careful.
374,14,8,1Nc7+,b'r1b1kb1r/2N2p1p/p1np4/1p2ppq1/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"All computers recommed this move giving it about +3 or +2. It's not a simple matter to follow through though. In fact if I play this as white I prefer 12 g4! The point being that after 12...fxg4 13. nc7+ black loses the rook with no counterplay and 12...qxg4 loses to 13. nf6+.
12. exf5 also looks good for white given that 12...qxg2 now loses to 13. nf6+ and then 14. Be4
but let's see how the most critical variation continues."

379,14,13,1Nd4,b'N1bk1b1r/5p1p/p2p4/1p2pp2/3nP3/N2B4/PPP2PqP/R2QKR2 w Q -',"This is best now. 14...fxe4 looks natural but actually helps white close off the h1-a8 diagonal.

Think about white's possibilities.
 15. Be2 is a common response to cover the weakness on f3. 15...qxe4 then threatens the knight on a8 and nf3++! I've won a few like that. If white then plays 16. f3 then probably 16...qxa8 and black is fine. He has 2 pawns and a knight for the rook plus a weak white king and the bishop pair. It's far from over but still ok. As an alternative in blitz I've played 16. f3 qh4+! 17 rf2 rg8 and black is also good. It's hard to find the right moves for white (although they do exist). 15. c3 is the computer's choice. I've never had an opponent play this (worried about nf3+ unduly) 15...nf3+ 16. ke2 and the king is absolutely in a box. It looks awful even though the computer says it's equal. After 16...Qg4 threatening all kinds of discoveries white has to play 17. rh1! to keep the advantage according to the computer. No-one would play this ever. So there is plenty of scope for swindling! 15. f3 looks decent cutting off that diagonal and giving the king a bit more room. After 15...Be7 though Bh4+ is a threat and white is suffering still. I think white then has to play 16. qd2 which after nxf3+ rxf3 Qxf3 looks back on track for black. White has an extra piece but having seen this with the computer it's clear that not being able to get the king safe is enough of a weakness to allow black great winning chances (and plenty of bail-out draws through perp). So white's next move is a mistake in hindsight but it's not easy to see that OTB and there aren't many alternatives.

The point is that the threat of qc7+ has to be dealt with and the queen gets out of danger. I'd still have 17..exd3+ kxd3 e4+ though and lots of compensation for the material. White's king is out in the open if kxe4 then nxe5+ wins etc.

He would have a rook and two pieces for the queen and a pawn albeit with his king exposed and some development difficulties. Qxg4 should be good for black but when you see a good move look for a better one!

I figured that black would want to run away via d2 and c1 so the bishop move cuts off this possibility. If he plays 21. c3 I have 21...qh3+ which forces 22. f3. After that the dark squares will be fatally weak. Here my opponent resigned.

390,15,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all; here's a brief by-request annotation of a recent game. This particular game shows how one small mistake early on can cascade into an unwinnable position over the course of the game. Enjoy!
391,15,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games. It makes for very sharp decisive play where the game may hang in the balance on every move.
392,15,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Too passive a continuation for my tastes but safer than the main lines (3.Nxe5 3.Bc4 3.exf4 3.d4).
393,15,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A waiting move. This Knight frequently proves hard to develop in this opening so I prefer to get it into play early.
394,15,4,Be3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White's play is solid if passive. This Bishop usually develops to g5 (or beyond!)
395,15,5,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np4/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Inaccurate but not deadly by any means. This move doesn't have any real effect except to hinder White's QN's development. As I mentioned earlier d2-d4 was playable all the way back at move 3; it didn't need support.
396,15,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues development while pressuring the White center.
397,15,7,Nbd2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',? And here suddenly unexpectedly White throws away a piece with a subtle mistake. The thing to notice is that with this move White's Bishop is trapped.
398,15,8,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4p3/4Pp2/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',And now Black wins the Bishop for a pawn. It's worth mentioning right now I think that White's play is very solid for the rest of the game. 6.Nbd2 was the only real mistake.
399,15,9,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/6N1/4Pp2/2PP4/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I like 8.Be2 better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.
400,15,10,Qd7,b'r3kb1r/pppq2p1/2npbn1p/8/4Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White looks like he's planning to go kingside so Black prepares to castle queenside and aims a battery toward the WK along the c8-h3 diagonal.
401,15,11,1Qa4,b'r3kb1r/pppq2p1/2npbn1p/8/Q3Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White's play is a little scattered but not at all bad. Here he begins to make queenside threats to discourage Black from castling.
402,15,12,1g5,b'r3kb1r/pppq4/2npbn1p/6p1/Q3Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq g6',Shoring up the weak pawn.
403,15,13,1Nd4,b'r3kb1r/pppq4/2npbn1p/6p1/Q2NPp2/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White's plans begin to take form; he piles up on the Nc6.
404,15,14,1Bg4,b'r3kb1r/pppq4/2np1n1p/6p1/Q2NPpb1/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',There's no real need to deal with the queenside pressure yet so Black offers a trade. Normally it's disadvantageous to trade a good Bishop for a bad one (as here) but Black is following a single very simple principle: when ahead in material (especially by a whole piece) trade pieces.
405,15,15,Bg7,b'r3k2r/pppq2b1/2np3p/6p1/Q2NPpn1/2PP4/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Even the best place for Black's extra Bishop isn't great right now with so much mass on the board so he aims it at the White Knight to create pressure.
406,15,16,1Nd2f3,b'r3k2r/pppq2b1/2np3p/6p1/Q2NPpn1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',White defends.
407,15,17,1a6,b'r3k2r/1ppq2b1/p1np3p/6p1/Q2NPpn1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black finally blocks up the WQ's pressure on a7 and as a result lessens the burden on c6 as well.
408,15,18,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1ppq2b1/p1np3p/6p1/3NPpn1/1QPP1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Defending b7 and getting the last Rook into play.
409,15,19,1h3,b'2kr3r/1ppq2b1/p1np3p/6p1/3NPpn1/1QPP1N1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',White drives off this pesky Knight though there is danger to remember when pushing pawns in front of your King--especially when the opponent already has advanced pawns to poke at the weakness.
410,15,20,1Nge5,b'2kr3r/1ppq2b1/p1np3p/4n1p1/3NPp2/1QPP1N1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Threatening d3 momentarily but take a very broad look at the board. Black is ahead in material but it doesn't really *feel* like he's all that far ahead. His extra Bishop is lounging on g7 not pointed at anything in particular and in fact cluttering up the g-file making direct attacks on the WK more difficult. Remember this feeling that Black is ahead but not overwhelmingly so.
411,15,21,1Nxe5,b'2kr3r/1ppq2b1/p1np3p/4N1p1/3NPp2/1QPP3P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',The computer doesn't mind this but I think it's a slight mistake of thought process. If Black is seeking to trade pieces it makes sense that White should oppose him in that endeavor. The fewer pieces on the board the bigger the difference that Black's extra Bishop will make. Now Black has several options for his next move. Given the goal of trading pieces as much as possible what is the best choice?
412,15,22,1Nxd4,b'2kr3r/1ppq2b1/p2p3p/4N1p1/3nPp2/1QPP3P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',! I think this is it. Black ensures that at the very least all the Knights will leave the board and perhaps more.
413,15,23,Rxd7,b'2k4r/1ppr2b1/p2p3p/6p1/4Pp2/1PPP3P/1P3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Off goes the material! Remember the feeling of Black not having *that* big an advantage? Well he's still up the same Bishop for a pawn but that difference suddenly is looking a lot more meaningful isn't it?
414,15,24,c5,b'2k4r/1p1r2b1/p2p3p/2p3p1/4Pp2/1PPP3P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - c6',With pieces off the board and a Bishop staring at the queenside Black needs to start thinking about pawn action.
415,15,25,2d4,b'2k4r/1p1r2b1/p2p3p/2p3p1/3PPp2/1PP4P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',This is an interesting thought isolating Black's d-pawn after 22...cxd4 23.cxd4 but also isolating the doubled White b-pawns. I don't think the trade is worth it (that said I'm not sure what's better. Perhaps 22.f3).
416,15,26,2c4,b'2k4r/1p1r2b1/p2p3p/6p1/2PpPp2/1P5P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Another interesting thought keeping the pawns together for greater strength and hoping to take out the passed d-pawn later.
417,15,27,2Kh2,b'4r3/1p1r2b1/pk1p3p/6p1/1PPpPp2/5P1P/1P4PK/R2R4 b - -',I do think it's worth mentioning that this is a very strange move. White ought to be moving his King toward the center so he can help with the final Rook-pawn-Bishop struggle by supporting positions and blockading pawns. In the corner like this the King is not a liability but he's also useless.
418,15,28,Rdd8,b'r2r4/1p4b1/pk1p3p/1P4p1/2PpPp2/5P1P/1P4PK/R2R4 w - -',In what is essentially a simple Rook-and-pawn endgame it sure is nice to have an ace in the hole--a Bishop reaching all the way across the board able to control key squares.
419,15,29,2b4,b'r2r4/1p4b1/pk1p3p/1P4p1/1PPpPp2/5P1P/6PK/R2R4 b - b3',It's not a big deal at this point but this does lose a pawn. The simpler 28.bxa6 was better.
420,15,30,3c5+,b'3r4/1p4b1/1k1p3p/1pP3p1/rP1pPp2/5P1P/6PK/2RR4 b - -',White's play does not lack for guts!
421,15,31,3Rd3,b'3r4/1p4b1/2k4p/1pP3p1/r2pPp2/3R1P1P/6PK/2R5 b - -',Critically blockading the d-pawn but Black's King is well-placed and he has the resources to force a footman through.
422,15,32,3Rc4,b'3r4/1p4b1/2k4p/1pP3p1/2rpPp2/3R1P1P/6PK/2R5 w - -',This Rook secures everything.
423,15,33,3Re1,b'3r4/1p4b1/7p/1pk3p1/2rpPp2/3R1P1P/6PK/4R3 b - -',There's nothing better for this Rook to do.
424,15,34,3Rc3,b'3r4/1p4b1/7p/1pk3p1/3pPp2/2rR1P1P/6PK/4R3 w - -',Forcing the issue of the blockaded pawn.
425,15,35,3Rxc3+,b'3r4/1p4b1/7p/1pk3p1/3pPp2/2R2P1P/6PK/4R3 b - -',35.Rdd1 was stiffer. This allows Black to connect his pawns and also lets his Bishop control the queening square (c1).
426,15,36,Rd2,b'8/1p4b1/7p/1pk3p1/4Pp2/2p2P1P/3r2PK/2R5 w - -',Covered by the Bishop Black is free to simply push on to victory.
427,15,37,c2,b'8/1p4b1/7p/1pk3p1/4Pp2/5P1P/2pr2P1/2R3K1 w - -',0-1. The coming 38...Bb2 and 39...c1=Q are unstoppable so White throws in the towel after a very well-fought game. Many thanks to chicoboy for a fantastic struggle. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!

445,17,5,Qh4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp3p/2n2nN1/5p2/4P2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',An interesting alternative. This move can lead to a rather bizarre attack on the White King through the center after (for example) 6...Rg8 7.Nxf8 Rg4 8.Qh6 Rxe4+ 9.Be2 Nd4 10.Nc3 Qe7 (or 9...Qe7 10.Nc3 Rxe2+!? 11.Nxe2 Nd4 12.O-O Nxe2+ 13.Kh1).
446,17,6,Kd1,b'r1bqkN2/pppp3p/2n2n1Q/5p2/4r3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBK1B1R b q -',?! I've encountered this move quite a bit on GK but it's unpopular in master play (not that this opening gets much use at all at that level). The issue is that with the King on d1 a Black Knight on g4 can create serious lasting problems. Observe:
447,17,7,Ng4,b'r1bqkN2/pppp3p/2n4Q/5p2/4r1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBK1B1R w q -',This is very strong. The WQ is suddenly relegated to defending f2 so she can't hold on to the Nf8 (e.g. 10.Qg7?? Nxf2#).
448,17,8,Kxf8,b'r1bq1k2/pppp3p/2n5/5p1Q/4r1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBK1B1R w - -',"I told you it was a bizarre attack. Let's take stock of the situation with some basic board evaluation principles (thanks id=elyhim ).
1. Material relationship: White has a material advantage with an extra pawn and a Bishop for a Knight.
2. Presence of direct threats: Both sides have significant threats. White threatens two of Black's pawns and has various future opportunities available. Black on the other hand threatens immediate mate on f2.
3. King Position/Safety: Neither player's King can be considered safe. White's is a little more tucked away but Black is more prepared to attack it.
4. Possession of open lines: Here the advantage goes to Black for his dominant Rook on the e-file.
5. Pawn structure weak and strong points: White's pawn structure is much more stable and has only one significant weak point: f2.
6. The center and space: Black rules the center with absolute authority and has vastly more space.
7. Development and the position of pieces: White's only developed piece is his Queen which is somewhat out-of-position and harassable. Black has developed three pieces and his Queen may be considered developed as well.
Conclusion: The position is very nearly equal. Black has perhaps a slight short-term advantage but if White plays very carefully he may be able to catch up in development and convert his material advantage and better pawns into a winning endgame."
449,17,9,1Qxf5+,b'r1bq1k2/pppp3p/2n5/5Q2/4r1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBK1B1R b - -',? Seemingly winning a Rook and pawn for nothing but in reality all this does is put the WQ in a precarious spot. After 11...Kg7 White cannot follow up by taking the Rook because of the powerful g4 Knight (and misplaced WK): 12.Qxe4?? Nxf2+ 13.Ke1 Nxe4. Best here was the simple 11.c3 giving the WK a bolt hole to prevent the mate threat on f2 without tying down the Queen.
450,17,10,1d3,b'r1bq4/pppp2kp/2n5/5Q2/4r1n1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBK1B1R b - -',This looks innocent enough but it's still worse than c2-c3. Now Black will force a favorable exchange to regain (approximate) material equality while maintaining a huge positional advantage.
451,17,11,1d6,b'r1bq4/ppp3kp/2np4/5Q2/4r1n1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBK1B1R w - -',Attempts to save the WQ by e.g. 13.Qf3 do not achieve their goal: either the Queen gives her life for material (but not positional) equality or else the King loses his. An example line might continue 13...Nxf2+ 14.Qxf2 Bg4+ and now either [A] 15.Be2 Bxe2+ 16.Qxe2 Rxe2 17.Kxe2 Nd4+ and Black is winning or [B] 15.Kd2 Qg5+ 16.Kc3 Qa5+ 17.Kb3 Qb4#. So White has nothing better than to give up his Queen for a Rook and Knight. 
452,17,12,1Ke1,b'r1bq4/ppp3kp/2np4/8/4Q3/3P4/PPP2nPP/RNB1KB1R b - -',The GK computer thinks this is a huge blunder giving 14.Ke2 as significantly better (but still losing) but I don't think there's a meaningful difference. Black's Q and B are both coming into play with tempo either way.
453,17,13,1dxe4,b'r1bq4/ppp3kp/2np4/8/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R b - -',"Now that so much material has leaped off the board it's time for another evaluation. Black has the move.
1. Material relationship: Material is unbalanced but approximately equal probably favoring Black slightly in the midgame due to his Queen but with good chances for White because of his extra piece.
2. Presence of direct threats: White has no threats. Black has a checking opportunity at h4 with more followup checks on the horizon. Advantage: Black.
3. King Position/Safety: Black's King is out in the open but White has no way to launch any sort of attack at the moment. White's King is on its home square but has no real defenders.
4. Possession of open lines: Black owns the diagonals c8-h3 and d8-h4 and is in position to make use of the open and half-open center lines. White's only open line is f3-a6 which has no real influence.
5. Pawn structure weak and strong points: White has a defenseless isolated e-pawn and ungarded c-pawn. He also has a kingside majority while Black has a queenside majority and a weak isolated h-pawn.
6. The center and space: White occupies the center with a pawn but the pawn is weak and he has no other pieces with central influence. Black controls the center with a Knight. Space is roughly even as neither player has many advanced pieces to lay claim to any of it.
7. Development and the position of pieces: White has no developed pieces. Black's Knight is developed to a fine square and his Queen and Bishop may both be considered developed also as they have long control over the White kingside.
Conclusion: Black has secured a sizable advantage despite the near-even material. He has the initiative and space in which to work and White will be hard-pressed to survive the coming attack with his undeveloped pieces."
454,17,14,1Kd1,b'r1b5/ppp3kp/2np4/8/4P2q/8/PPP3PP/RNBK1B1R b - -',?? This is simply a blunder. Best was 16.Ke2 though after ...Bg4+ 17.Kd3 White is still basically hosed. I didn't see it at the time but there's actually a forced mate here. Can you find it?
455,17,15,Nd4+,b'r7/ppp3kp/3p4/8/3nP2q/8/PPP1K1PP/RNB4R w - -',Actually a mistake but it doesn't make much difference. This allows White to get out of the forced mate via 19.Kd3 Qf2 20.Bd2 (blocking c2) Qxg2 etc. The best continuation was (last chance to look for the mate yourself!) (e.g.) 18...Qxe4+ 19.Kf2 Rf8+ 20.Kg3 Qg6+ 21.Kh4 Ne5! 22.h3 Nf3+! (drawing away the g-pawn) 23.gxf3 Rf5 24.Bh6+ Kxh6 25.Rg1 Rh5#.

There's a new forced mate now (7 moves or less) which I do actually notice this time. Try to find it before you scroll down; it's pretty straightforward.
457,17,17,2Qxc2+,b'r7/ppp3kp/3p4/8/3nP3/3KB3/PPq3PP/RN5R w - -',The moment Black regained equality he tosses it away in favor of a more important goal--the White King. (Of course the Knight was lost anyway but now White cannot take it with check!)

Myevilluck is certainly bombing towards his next goal that is to become a Gameknot Master with a rating north of 2200.  If he keeps this up he will certainly get there because he achieved an IM Draw with the mighty Klauno (Klaus).  So how did this happen?"

Usually in the Sicilian the WK almost always goes to b8 because black usually plonks a BQ on the c column or a black rook leaving the possibility of a very strong attack of heavy artilliary on the a b and c column.  Sometimes particularly in the Sicilian Dragon an exchange sac on c3 occurs to bust up white's pawn structure and leave the WK open to hostile castle fire and an attack from a dsb from the a1-h8 diagonal.  In this game the black dsb is on the a3-f8 diagonal but there is still a possibility of that prelate coming in to a3 at a later date so Myevilluck - beware!

Here he thought a while but still doesn't see the obvious checkmate in one if he doesn't give up a piece or give up the queen exchange. My next move will be Nxa7 checkmate which actually occurs because black overlooks it. Playing back through this game slowly one can see several dubious choices black made; none seemed horribly wrong but together they caused this losing position. I don't want to analyze what black should have done in those past moves for he had several better moves to pick from and my play as white wasn't necessarily completely accurate either. But here is there something better for black than Qxe1? I'd say... no. bryanofbay when you've learned to form a more cohesive plan and understand positional play a bit better your game will greatly improve.
