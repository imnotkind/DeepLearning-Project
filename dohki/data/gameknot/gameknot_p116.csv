0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a GK tournament game in which I choose the Latvian Gambit with the Black pieces and White quietly declines my offer resulting in a more positional Latvian than usual. I end up with an advanced center pawn mass and rush to use it to knock the position open (a little prematurely) before White can coordinate a flanking attack. What results is a bit of a race as each side tears the other's pawns apart in a rush to clear a path to promotion. Enjoy!
1,0,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
2,0,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a somewhat unusual way for White to decline the gambit. It tends to lead to somewhat more positional play than the main lines (3.Nxe5 or 3.Bc4) though the situation still generally gets very sharp and can transpose to the Philidor Counter-Gambit after 3...d6 4.d4.
3,0,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',More common are 3...Nf6 or 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Qf6.
4,0,4,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This feels very passive to me; 4.d4 is perfectly playable (reaching the Philidor Counter-Gambit) but d3 blocks White's Bishop needlessly in my opinion.
5,0,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/3p4/2p1pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',?! Black continues to blast his pawns forward intent on restricting White's mobility at any cost and trying to seize on his perceived passivity to make a grab for the center. This move does allow White to put an untouchable Nd5 if he desires though which could be problematic against Black's fully-undeveloped home rank.
6,0,6,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/3p4/2p1pp2/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',? I feel this is an error. White just trapped his LSB with the previous move and now he spends another move preparing to fianchetto the DSB? Simple development would be stronger here especially since that Bishop will have few prospects on b2. This move also makes c3 into a dangerous weakness.
7,0,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp4pp/2np4/2p1pp2/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Logical development seeking further control of d4 since White is apparently worried about it.
8,0,8,a3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp4pp/2np4/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This prevents ...Nb4 but that doesn't seem like much of a threat at this point.
9,0,9,h3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp4pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',? What is White doing? Again he prevents Black from occupying slightly-inconvenient squares but he allows his opponent to catch up in development while he wastes time with little passive pawn moves.
10,0,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Both sides develop logically. Black has a formidable center pawn mass while White seems able to develop an attack on either flank.
11,0,11,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n2n2/2pppp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',!? Black's pawns are only delicately defended but he wants to force White into an exchange and create a push in the center before White can mobilize his flanks.
12,0,12,1exd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n2n2/2pPpp2/8/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Necessary to prevent ...d4 from locking his position down entirely.
13,0,13,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pnpp2/8/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black releases his DSB to the kingside and targets White's vulnerable Nc3.
14,0,14,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pNpp2/8/PP1P1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Probably the best move allowing Bb2 and some degree of control over the diagonal while trading off the weak Knight.
15,0,15,1d4,b'r1b2rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pqpp2/3P4/PP3N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',! Black cannot recapture as White is threatening 13.Bc4 and White also threatens to discover an attack on the powerful but undefended Black Queen with 12...Kh8 dxe5 winning a pawn and placing a powerful wedge at e5.
16,0,16,1Be6,b'r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2pqpp2/3P4/PP3N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black continues his development and connects his Rooks while just barely defending White's main threat.
17,0,17,1Bc4,b'r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2pqpp2/2BP4/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',?! This is certainly more aggressive than 13.dxe5 but not quite as strong as White's pawn structure will now take a hit.
18,0,18,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2nqb3/2p1pp2/2BP4/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The BQ keeps everything defended for now.
19,0,19,Qxd1,b'r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2p1Pp2/2B5/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1Bq1RK1 w - -',Not 14...Nxe5?? 15.Qxd6 and Black loses the LSB for nothing.
20,0,20,h6,b'r4rk1/pp2b1p1/2n4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1BR2K1 w - -',? This prevents Ng5 but is akin to White's earlier pawn moves--it prevents something which simply is not a threat. 17.Ng5 would be met with simply ...Nxe5.
21,0,21,1Rd7,b'r4rk1/pp1Rb1p1/2n4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 b - -',This is strong though White's Bishop is still trapping his other Rook. 17.Bb2 might have been more accurate.
22,0,22,1b6,b'r4rk1/p2Rb1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 w - -',Black tries to avoid tying his Rook down to defending home-square pawns--that way lies madness.
23,0,23,1Rc7,b'r4rk1/p1R1b1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 b - -',?! This is decent and forces an exchange of Rooks but White really needs to complete his development. He can threaten the Knight much more forcefully with Bb2 (18.Bf4?! g5) followed by e5-e6 and Ne5.
24,0,24,1Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/p1R1b1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 w - -',Forced but it does at least give Black's Bishop another square to escape to if necessary.
25,0,25,1Rd7,b'r1r3k1/p2Rb1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 b - -',White declines the trade he originally set up which is probably a good idea as Black can probably draw if given a strong initiative.
26,0,26,1Rcd8,b'r2r2k1/p2Rb1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 w - -',Black contests the open d-file mostly because he has little alternative.
27,0,27,2Rxd8+,b'r2R2k1/p3b1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2P2PP1/R1B3K1 b - -',? Why White would take here rather than on c8 is beyond me. It seems to me that 20.e6 would be much better.
28,0,28,2Bd2,b'3r2k1/p3b1p1/1pn4p/2p1Pp2/2P5/P4N1P/2PB1PP1/R5K1 b - -',? The Bishop finally comes out to a square where it loses White a pawn and has no more influence on the board than it did on c1. I believe 21.Bb2 or 21.Bf4 would have been considerably better.
29,0,29,2Nxe5,b'3r2k1/p3b1p1/1p5p/2p1np2/2P5/P4N1P/2PB1PP1/R5K1 w - -',Black eagerly consumes White's passed pawn and threatens to win the Bishop as well.
30,0,30,2Nxe5,b'3r2k1/p3b1p1/1p5p/2p1Np2/2P5/P6P/2PB1PP1/R5K1 b - -',This is really White's only decent move preserving material and his kingside pawn structure.
31,0,31,2Rxd2,b'6k1/p3b1p1/1p5p/2p1Np2/2P5/P6P/2Pr1PP1/R5K1 w - -',22...Bf6 was also possible but the pin is fairly weak and could prove dangerous for Black.
32,0,32,2Nc6,b'6k1/p3b1p1/1pN4p/2p2p2/2P5/P6P/2Pr1PP1/R5K1 b - -',"White begins a game of ""who can kill all the other guy's pawns first"". Unfortunately as he has a Knight and an unmoved Rook against a Bishop and a very powerful Rook it's not likely to be a race he can win."
33,0,33,2Bf6,b'6k1/p5p1/1pN2b1p/2p2p2/2P5/P6P/2Pr1PP1/R5K1 w - -',Black will at least hold his own in material here (24.Ra2 Kf7 25.Nxa7 Bd4) and potentially do much better if White slips up.
34,0,34,2Re1,b'6k1/p5p1/1pN2b1p/2p2p2/2P5/P6P/2Pr1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',This has the downside of not defending any of White's pawns though it may allow him to trade off his Knight for the Black Bishop.
35,0,35,2Rxc2,b'6k1/p5p1/1pN2b1p/2p2p2/2P5/P6P/2r2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Black begins the massacre. He's looking to promote the c-pawn as his Bishop controls the queening square. White cannot defend c4 now and he still has to be careful of ...Bd4 and ...Bf2+.
36,0,36,2Nxa7,b'6k1/N5p1/1p3b1p/2p2p2/2P5/P6P/2r2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',25.Ne7+ Bxe7 26.Rxe7 Rxc4 27.Rxa7 was probably better.
37,0,37,2Bd4,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/2Pb4/P6P/2r2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Threatening 26...Bxf2+ and an easy win with a Rook against a Knight.
38,0,38,2Rf1,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/2Pb4/P6P/2r2PP1/5RK1 b - -',White defends f2 but puts his Rook in a hopelessly passive position.
39,0,39,2Rxc4,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/2rb4/P6P/5PP1/5RK1 w - -',Soon White will have no way to stop the c-pawn.
40,0,40,2g3,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/2rb4/P5PP/5P2/5RK1 b - -',Denying Black the opportunity for mate after ...Be5 if the White Rook ever leaves the back rank but more importantly giving the King someplace to go to unpin his f-pawn while leaving the Rook free to move about.
41,0,41,2Rc2,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/3b4/P5PP/2r2P2/5RK1 w - -',Black's passed pawn is free to advance the White Rook is tied down again to f1 and the f-pawn will now remain pinned after Kg2. Black also threatens to slip behind the a-pawn or sidle over with Rb2 and prevent the White Knight from coming back to b5.
42,0,42,2Kg2,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2p2p2/3b4/P5PP/2r2PK1/5R2 b - -',Necessary if White wants to get any counterplay at all on the kingside.
43,0,43,2c4,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/5p2/2pb4/P5PP/2r2PK1/5R2 w - -',The c-pawn begins its journey.
44,0,44,2Kf3,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/5p2/2pb4/P4KPP/2r2P2/5R2 b - -',White moves on f5. He gives Black an interesting option: 29...Rc3+ 30.Kf4 Rxa3 31.Nb5 Rd3 32.Nxd4 Rxd4+ 33.Kxf5 and both of Black's queenside pawns are now free to advance but the White King is in a very powerful spot.
45,0,45,2Bc5,b'6k1/N5p1/1p5p/2b2p2/2p5/P4KPP/2r2P2/5R2 w - -',Black pulls the Bishop back to a safer location while keeping an eye on f2 and now threatening a3.
46,0,46,3Nb5,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/1Nb2p2/2p5/P4KPP/2r2P2/5R2 b - -',White's Knight finally returns from its exile trying to re-enter the game.
47,0,47,3Rb2,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/1Nb2p2/2p5/P4KPP/1r3P2/5R2 w - -',Black prepares to win the pawn by force.
48,0,48,Ra2,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/1Nb2p2/P1p5/5KPP/r4P2/5R2 w - -',Black sets a trap for the White Knight. If it tries to save the doomed pawn with 32.Nc3? Black will win the Knight with ...Ra3.
49,0,49,3Nc3,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/2b2p2/P1p5/2N2KPP/r4P2/5R2 b - -',? White takes the bait.
50,0,50,3Rc1,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/2b2p2/P1p5/r1N2KPP/5P2/2R5 b - -',Futile. 33.Kf4 would be more direct and allow White to take the f-pawn without requiring the loss of his Rook. Now after 33...Bd4 34.Kf4 Rxc3 White must move his Rook again to avoid a devastating trade giving Black time to play ...g6. If the White Rook had remained on f1 at least he could have taken the f-pawn for free.
51,0,51,3Rd1,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/5p2/P1pb1K2/2r3PP/5P2/3R4 b - -',?! White prevents his opponent from defending f5 at the cost of his own f-pawn.
52,0,52,3Kxf5,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/5K2/P1p5/2r3PP/5b2/3R4 b - -',...and g-pawn. White may be hoping for a King-and-Rook mate on Black's back rank but his opponent would have to blunder seriously to allow that.
53,0,53,3Rxg3,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/5K2/P1p5/6rP/5b2/3R4 w - -',As long as the Rook stays here there is no chance for White to contrive a mate after Rd1+ Kh7.
54,0,54,3Rd5,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/3R1K2/P1p5/6rP/5b2/8 b - -',? 37.Rd2 followed by 38.Rc2 or else 37.Rd8+ Kh7 38.Rc8 was probably better. Now the Rook has no way to get behind the c-pawn.
55,0,55,3a5,b'6k1/6p1/1p5p/P2R1K2/8/2p3rP/5b2/8 b - -',Valiant but foolhardy. Nothing can stop Black's pawn from getting to the coronation ceremony now.
56,0,56,4Ke6,b'3R4/P5pk/1p2K2p/6r1/8/7P/5b2/2q5 b - -',43.Ke4 Qe3#
57,0,57,4Qc6+,b'3R4/P5pk/1pq1K2p/6r1/8/7P/5b2/8 w - -',"0-1. White throws in the towel though he could have drawn it out for a bit longer. White's declining of the Gambit and his defensive mindset throughout the opening gave Black all the space in the world to set up his center attack and negate the weaknesses of his chosen opening. Coupled with a few positional inaccuracies from White Black had all the tools he could desire to bring about his winning endgame.

Many thanks to biscuit999 for this game! Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also comment to let me know what I did well or need to improve! Thanks for reading!"
58,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is one game of a team match (the other may be found here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/complications?gm=45162 ). I find myself on the receiving end of a King's Gambit an opening I'm quite fond of with the White pieces despite its instabilities and apparent ""refutations"". My opponent quickly gambits two additional pawns in a manner I've never seen resulting in my pawns being very overextended but White hard-pressed to actually win them and complete his development. I eventually manage to turn my spatial advantage into a developmental one and engineer a strong push down the center of the board. Enjoy!"
59,1,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',The King's Gambit one of the game's oldest documented openings. No longer very popular at high levels it nonetheless retains some stalwart Master and Grandmaster supporters. White offers the f-pawn in exchange for a strong center and developmental lead.
60,1,2,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black accepts the gambit. This is probably the most common response though many ways of declining it or offering countergambits exist such as 2...Bc5 and 2...d5.
61,1,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White continues with the Bishop's Gambit a particularly aggressive line. Slightly more common is 3.Nf3 preventing ...Qh4+ but 4.Kf1 and 5.Nf3 driving the Queen away is considered fine for White and his developmental advantage will continue to grow.
62,1,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',3...Nf6 is much more common. Instead Black chooses a waiting move--the Maurian Defense. The Knight may become a target for White's d-pawn but White may risk overextending.
63,1,5,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The standard continuation is 4.d4 but this is perfectly playable (transposing into more of a King's Knight's Gambit). White prepares to castle and d2-d4 is still an option.
64,1,6,g5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq g6',Black reinforces f5 and prevents White from castling immediately: 5.O-O g4! 6.Ne1 and White's position is looking ugly. Of course White can play 6.d4 gxf3 7.Nc3 fxg2 8.Bxf7+ with an attack similar to the Muzio Gambit.
65,1,7,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',White establishes a strong center and threatens to move on the Black Knight.
66,1,8,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black develops the Bishop to a natural location leaving e7 open in case he decides to get his Knight over to g6.
67,1,9,Nc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White continues development and defends his e-pawn as e7 could soon host a Black Queen.
68,1,10,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move gives a position something like the Fischer Defense freeing the Black LSB and preventing a White Knight from landing at e5.
69,1,11,e5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/4P1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! White wants to press the attack while leaving the a2-g8 diagonal open for his Bishop. This seems premature to me though; he could afford to castle first and get a Rook onto the e-file making this thrust much more potent.
70,1,12,dxe5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/4p1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black invites the trade since he's already ahead a pawn and if he can remove some of White's pieces from the board his advanced kingside pawns may be difficult to hold back.
71,1,13,Ne2,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/4p1p1/2BP1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',??! Apparently White was only bluffing about the trade he offered on e5--now he wastes a move getting his Knight out of harm's way instead of simply retaking. This additional two-pawn gambit does nothing as far as I can see to weaken Black's position besides potentially overextending his center and certainly does not improve White's development. 8.Qe2 might have been a stronger way to decline retaking the pawn right away.
72,1,14,exd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/6p1/2Bp1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black's center pawns are seriously overextended but thanks to his Nc6 and powerful DSB they're adequately defended for now and the positional advantage White strives for in the King's Gambit is nowhere to be seen.
73,1,15,Bb5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/1B4p1/3p1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Seeing his pieces in disarray White relinquishes pressure on f7 and instead threatens to win the d-pawn.
74,1,16,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/2n5/1B4p1/3p1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black defends his Knight preparing to castle and preventing White from doubling his pawns on the queenside. The d- or g-pawn is forfeit but Black can afford to give back a little material in exchange for consolidating his position somewhat.
75,1,17,1O-O,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/2n5/1B4p1/3p1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The WK decides it's time to get out of dodge though this allows Black to save his advanced d-pawn.
76,1,18,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/2n5/1B4p1/3p1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The BK escapes his pin and the dangerous open e-file.
77,1,19,1Nxg5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/2n5/1B4N1/3p1p2/8/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White reclaims a pawn and threatens to pick up another while opening the f-file for his Rook.
78,1,20,1Ng6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n3n1/1B4N1/3p1p2/8/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',! Black defends his lonely f-pawn with a threat to White's Knight. The f-pawn is especially valuable as it limits the possible scope of White's DSB.
79,1,21,1Bxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2B3n1/6N1/3p1p2/8/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White can now double the Black pawns or at least remove d4's defender.
80,1,22,1Qxg5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/2B3n1/6q1/3p1p2/8/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Preferring to keep his pawn structure reasonably intact Black scoops up the Knight and further defends f4. White cannot take it yet as he cannot afford to lose his LSB.
81,1,23,1Bf3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pbp/6n1/6q1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I think 13.Be4 might have been stronger. This block's White's Rook from its continued assault on f4.
82,1,24,1Be5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/6n1/4b1q1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black lends f4 additional support looking to get his Queen out of the pin.
83,1,25,1Qe1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/6n1/4b1q1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 b - -',?! White slides over to take aim at e5 but the Bishop is well-defended has another pawn available as defense and the White Rook would be better on e1 anyway. White should also be looking to prepare b2-b3 for when Black excuses himself from the Bishop's pin White needs to be able to get that Bishop into real action as soon as possible and a3 looks like a decent place to do so.
84,1,26,1c6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4b1q1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QRK1 w - -',Black stymies the White Bishop from its attack on the b-pawn and denies it the d5 square. Black's own LSB is now free to roam and looking dangerous to White's pinned g-pawn and trapped Rook.
85,1,27,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4b1q1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QR1K b - -',White wisely removes his King from the pin.
86,1,28,1Bf5,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bbq1/3p1p2/5B2/PPP1N1PP/R1B1QR1K w - -',So instead of g2 Black takes aim at White's undeveloped queenside as he brings his second Bishop to bear.
87,1,29,1Ng3,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bbq1/3p1p2/5BN1/PPP3PP/R1B1QR1K b - -',! The c-pawn is gone but White finally brings his Knight up to a more active post and unblocks his Queen. Perhaps he can untangle his pieces after all.
88,1,30,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4b1q1/3pNp2/5B2/PPb3PP/R1B1QR1K b - -',This is a strong position for the Knight and invites a bittersweet exchange--Black is three pawns ahead but White needs to lessen the pressure to gain time for consolidation.
89,1,31,1Qf5,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bq2/3pNp2/5B2/PPb3PP/R1B1QR1K w - -',Black finally ends the pin on his f-pawn threatening to bring his a8 Rook into play and then make good on the e4 exchange and follow up by pushing one or both of his forward pawns.
90,1,32,1Nd2,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN2PP/R1B1QR1K b - -',? White doesn't want to deal with the trade now that the BQ is free to roam and can defend d4-d3 but this move blocks in his DSB and doesn't accomplish much of anything in my opinion. 18...Bxe4 19.Bxe4 gives White the initiative; there was no reason to avoid that trade for now.
91,1,33,1Rae8,b'4rrk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN2PP/R1B1QR1K w - -',All of Black's pieces are now developed and aimed at the White Kingside. In contrast White's pieces have very little space to maneuver and several are not participating at all.
92,1,34,1Qf2,b'4rrk1/pp3p1p/2p3n1/4bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN1QPP/R1B2R1K b - -',The WQ flees the Rook's gaze to a slightly more active location.
93,1,35,1c5,b'4rrk1/pp3p1p/6n1/2p1bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN1QPP/R1B2R1K w - -',Black defends his passed d-pawn. With the demise of White's pawn on c2 it has become a much more valuable asset.
94,1,36,2Re1,b'4rrk1/pp3p1p/6n1/2p1bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN1QPP/R1B1R2K b - -',I think 20.Nc4 or 20.b3 are much more potent here. White's other Rook would be strong on e1 if only it could get there--he needs to get the Bishop into play.
95,1,37,2Kh8,b'4rr1k/pp3p1p/6n1/2p1bq2/3p1p2/5B2/PPbN1QPP/R1B1R2K w - -',With d5 now available once more for a White Bishop The BK slides away from that diagonal while opening g2 for his passive-looking Rook.
96,1,38,2Ne4,b'4rr1k/pp3p1p/6n1/2p1bq2/3pNp2/5B2/PPb2QPP/R1B1R2K b - -',?! White's multiple threats force this trade finally but I think his time for the last few moves would have been better spent developing his Queen's Bishop and Rook.
97,1,39,2Bxe4,b'4rr1k/pp3p1p/6n1/2p1bq2/3pbp2/5B2/PP3QPP/R1B1R2K w - -',Black's mounting attack looks formidable. His pieces show a tremendous amount of activity compared to White's passive defensive posture.
98,1,40,Qf6,b'4rr1k/pp3p1p/5qn1/2p1b3/3pBp2/8/PP3QPP/R1B1R2K w - -',Maintaining defense of f4 and preventing the WQ from invading via Qh4 (after Bxg6).
99,1,41,2Bxg6,b'4rr1k/pp3p1p/5qB1/2p1b3/3p1p2/8/PP3QPP/R1B1R2K b - -',? This seems like a clear mistake to me. White closes the g-file but trades an active Bishop for a relatively out-of-the-way Knight and allows Black to get his Rf8 into action behind the powerful f4 pawn. I think 23.Bd2 or 23.b3 (23...d3 24.Rb1 with a sort of implied pin from the threat of Bb2) would have been much better choices.
100,1,42,2b3,b'4rr1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p1b3/3p1p2/1P6/P4QPP/R1B1R2K b - -',This is probably still the best move but it's SO LATE.
101,1,43,2d3,b'4rr1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p1b3/5p2/1P1p4/P4QPP/R1B1R2K w - -',The powerful d-pawn begins marching for glory.
102,1,44,2Rb1,b'4rr1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p1b3/5p2/1P1p4/P4QPP/1RB1R2K b - -',The only move but now with no White Bishop on e4 Bb2 is a poor option after 25...Bd4: 26.Bb2?? Bxb2 27.Rxb2? Rxe1+ 28.Qxe1 Qxb2 and Black wins easily.
103,1,45,2Bd4,b'4rr1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b1p2/1P1p4/P4QPP/1RB1R2K w - -',This is a waiting move more than anything else. Black wants to either bait 26.Bb2?? or simply position the Bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal and get it off the e-file in preparation for the final assault.
104,1,46,2Qf1,b'4rr1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b1p2/1P1p4/P5PP/1RB1RQ1K b - -',I don't see anything much better. The Queen cannot relinquish defense of the Re1.
105,1,47,2Rxe1,b'5r1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b1p2/1P1p4/P5PP/1RB1rQ1K w - -',Pulling the WQ from her defense of f3.
106,1,48,f3,b'5r1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b4/1P1p1p2/P5PP/1RB1Q2K w - -',The f-pawn joins his brother on the third rank.
107,1,49,2Qf1,b'5r1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b4/1P1p1p2/P5PP/1RB2Q1K b - -',The particular choices White makes at this point are somewhat irrelevant; he is pretty well lost. 28.Be3 might hold out the best though (obviously he cannot take the pawn 28.gxf3?? Qxf3#).
108,1,50,2fxg2+,b'5r1k/pp5p/5qp1/2p5/3b4/1P1p4/P5pP/1RB2Q1K w - -',Black forces the final set of exchanges on his terms his two advanced pawns from early in the game rampaging down the last few ranks of the board.
109,1,51,d2,b'7k/pp5p/6p1/2p5/3b4/1P6/P2p2KP/1RB2r2 w - -',! Now White is entirely lost. Preventing the promotion ceremony fails to 32.Bxd2 Rxb1 and taking the Black Rook is no better (and is in fact much worse).
110,1,52,3Kxf1,b'7k/pp5p/6p1/2p5/3b4/1P6/P2p3P/1RB2K2 b - -',This is mate in 6 (32...d1=Q+ 33.Kg2 Qg1+ 34.Kf3 Qf2+ 35.Kg4 h5+ 36.Kh3 Qf3+ 37.Kh4 Qg4#). I don't see a faster alternative than 33...Qg1+ but it certainly might exist.
111,1,53,Qc2+,b'7k/pp5p/6p1/2p5/3b4/1P6/P1q3KP/1RB5 w - -',"? There's actually a mate here that I missed at the time (see above) but winning the Rook was enough to convince White to resign anyway. White's early pawn sacrifices failed to net him the positional compensation he needed as Black was able to hold onto his dangerously overadvanced pawns long enough to smash them down the board into the unprepared White pieces. It may be worth noting that White's DSB never moved even once while White's Queen Knight took six moves to get to e4--a space reachable in just two jumps from b1.

112,2,0,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',All standard enough.
113,2,1,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',!?   The Evans Gambit.   Probably objectively not sound but at the board what a computer thinks is often irrelevant.
114,2,2,Bxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think black is usually best served accepting the gambit; if the bishop goes to b6 it can end up shut in completely after a c3 and d4 push.
115,2,3,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',However now white gets in c3 with tempo.
116,2,4,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',The point of the Evans Gambit.   White for the sac of a pawn stakes a large claim in the centre.   Black's DSB meanwhile isn't really in the game.
117,2,5,Qb3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I think this may be the main line.   f7 is under threat.   Black however could at some stage take on c3 with discovered check threats.
118,2,6,d5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/b2p4/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq d6',?  7. … Qe7 or Qf6 is called for here to defend f7.   d5 ideas aren’t uncommon in some gambit lines (like the Bertin Gambit in the King’s Gambit); the idea is to give back some of the material gained to develop quicker.   It doesn’t really work here though; it’s basically a free pawn and with the knight on c6 it’s doubly dangerous for black.
119,2,7,exd5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/b2P4/2Bp4/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',!?   Probably better than BxP; the knight is going to get kicked to an awkward square and the threats against f7 haven't gone away.
120,2,8,Qe7+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2n5/b2P4/2Bp4/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This looks natural – the king must move forfeiting castling rights (9. Be2 is met with d3 winning the pinned piece).   In actual fact it’s the start of quite a ride for black!
121,2,9,Kd1,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2n5/b2P4/2Bp4/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNBK3R b kq -',There was a debate after the game as to the best square for the king here - safety on f1 followed by developing while hitting the queen with Ba3 Nd2 and Re1 or this move allowing the immediate threat of Re1 in addition to the problem of the hanging knight.   After a minute’s thought Fritz rates Kf1 0.17 better but white has a clear advantage here either way (+3 or so).
122,2,10,Ne5,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/8/b2Pn3/2Bp4/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNBK3R w kq -',A blunder.   After 10. NxN the white knight is immune from capture due to the Re1 pin.   Best here was 10. dxc says Fritz.
123,2,11,1Qb5+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/8/bQ1PN3/2B5/2p5/P4PPP/RNBK3R b kq -',Looks like it wins a piece but doesn't because...
124,2,12,1Kd8,b'r1bk2nr/ppp1qppp/8/bQ1PN3/2B5/2p5/P4PPP/RNBK3R w - -',Now the queen can capture the knight and Re1 doesn't work.   So instead...
125,2,13,1d6,b'r1bk2nr/ppp1qppp/3P4/bQ2N3/2B5/2p5/P4PPP/RNBK3R b - -',! Protects the knight opens up a line for the bishop onto the weak f7 square threatens to take the bishop on a5 AND hits the queen.   What more can you ask of one move?
126,2,14,1Bg4+,b'r2k2nr/ppp1qppp/3P4/bQ2N3/2B3b1/2p5/P4PPP/RNBK3R w - -',A desperate spite check; anything to get some pieces developed.
127,2,15,1Kc2,b'r2k2nr/ppp1qppp/3P4/bQ2N3/2B3b1/2p5/P1K2PPP/RNB4R b - -',!   Again the strongest.   Black’s checks are going nowhere and the knight is in too fine an attacking position to consider wasting time capturing the worthless black bishop.   White is after black's king and isn't about to be distracted.
128,2,16,1Kb3,b'r2k2nr/ppp1qppp/3P4/bQ2Nb2/2B5/1Kp5/P4PPP/RNB4R b - -',The king is quite safe here.
129,2,17,1a6,b'r2k2nr/1pp1qppp/p2P4/bQ2Nb2/2B5/1Kp5/P4PPP/RNB4R w - -',?? An unfortunate way to end a nice miniature though black was lost anyway.
130,2,18,1dxe7+,b'r2k2nr/1pp1Pppp/p7/bQ2Nb2/2B5/1Kp5/P4PPP/RNB4R b - -',Black must get out of check and white can save his own queen.   Black was lost anyway - if instead 14. ... Qe6 or Qh4 there follows 15. NxP+ Kc8   16. Qe8+ Qd8   17. QxQ#   If 14. ... QxP Nxf7 is a nice family fork - queen king and rook.   14. ... PxP is probably best but white can play 15. Nxf7+ and both black bishops are going to fall depending on where black moves his king.

If White ever loses the initiative after playing e5 Black is ready to detonate the center which would be overextended and has three stress points.

178,5,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
179,5,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a variation I'm not particularly familiar with in the Latvian standard are 3. Nxe5 or 3. Bc4. Black's main responses here are 4...fxe4 5. Nxe5 Qf6 which can transpose back into the main line after 6. Nc4 or 3. Nf6 4. Bc4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 d5 6. Nxd5 Nxd5 7. Qh5+.
180,5,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',...But I opt for this move which transposes instead to the Philidor Counter-Gambit a line favored by Paul Morphy.
181,5,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',We have arrived at the Philidor Counter-Gambit; this position would normally be reached via 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 f5?! 4. Nc3.
182,5,4,fxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4p3/3Pp3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This can lead to 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Neg5 which is fairly strong for White (though Jim West has suggested that 6...exd4 7. Nxd4 Qe7+ gives Black good chances). Perhaps better is 4...exd4. 
183,5,5,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues his aggression.
184,5,6,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is not a true sacrifice merely baiting Black's pawn to an extended isolated spot on e5. White can win the material back after 6...dxe4 7. Qh5+ g6 8. Nxg6.
185,5,7,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/4N3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Declining White's sacrifice would be somewhat ungentlemanly. 
186,5,8,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/7Q/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.
187,5,9,Kf7,b'rnbq1b1r/ppp2k1p/5nN1/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',The only reasonable move. For an opening Black chose his position is not looking so good. He must be extremely careful now that he doesn't get his King trapped by White's pieces.
188,5,10,1Bg5,b'rnbq1bkN/ppp4p/5n2/4Q1B1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',White pins the Knight threatening either Qxe4 or Bxf6 and the deadly attack will continue.
189,5,11,1Be7,b'rnbq2kN/ppp1b2p/5n2/4Q1B1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',11...Bg7 would put the Bishop in a more comfortable location but allows an immediate 12. Qxe4. Black is also dearly hoping to be able to develop his Nb8 with tempo by attacking the WQ but the initiative is still firmly in White's grasp.
190,5,12,Kxh8,b'rnbq3k/ppp4p/5b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',White's attack has run out of steam for now though Black is behind in material underdeveloped and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#.
191,5,13,1O-O-O,b'rnbq3k/ppp4p/5b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',White gets his King to safety and reinforces the d-pawn. Black needs to develop his pieces but the powerful WQ in the center of the board severely limits his choices.
192,5,14,1Nc6,b'r1bq3k/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - -',Allowing the Bc8 to move without endangering the b-pawn.
193,5,15,1Bd3,b'r1bq3k/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',White develops with a critical threat. Another option here was 15. d5 forcing the Black Knight to move again and cramping the Black position further with control of e6.
194,5,16,1Qg8,b'r1b3qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',This seems the only sensible way to defend h7. Black is two pawns down and can't very well afford to trade off his Queen on e7.
195,5,17,1h3,b'r1b3qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R b - -',?! White makes plans to storm the pitiful Black castle while preparing to further restrict Black's LSB's range with g2-g4. 16. d5 might have been more reliable denying Black the e6 square and getting the d-pawn out of immediate danger.
196,5,18,1Be6,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n1bb2/8/3PQ3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Black develops while defending against d4-d5 and threatens to grab a free pawn on the queenside. 16...Nxe4 or 16...Bxe4 are probably also possible here but if Black wants to stand a chance he needs to get his pieces mobilized as soon as possible.
197,5,19,1c4,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n1bb2/8/2PPQ3/3B3P/PP3PP1/2KR3R b - c3',? This is either an oversight or a tactic too deep for me to see the purpose. The Black Bishop is drawn in momentarily allowing White to repel it while defending his remaining queenside pawns but it seems to me that 17. b3 followed by 18. c4 would be stronger. Alternately 17. Rhe1 would be a solid developing move giving White control of the e-file.
198,5,20,1Bxc4,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/2bPQ3/3B3P/PP3PP1/2KR3R w - -',This pawn is free; if White exchanges Black takes back with check and subsequently wins the d-pawn as well.
199,5,21,1b3,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/2bPQ3/1P1B3P/P4PP1/2KR3R b - -',Shoring up those last two pawns. White's castle is looking messy but luckily Black has no way in (...Bg5+ is handily refuted by f2-f4) and still has to contend with the threat of mate on h7.
200,5,22,1Bd5,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/3b4/3PQ3/1P1B3P/P4PP1/2KR3R w - -',Black retreats his Bishop with tempo promising to win more pawns as he stares down at g2.
201,5,23,1Qf5,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/3b1Q2/3P4/1P1B3P/P4PP1/2KR3R b - -',This is one of surprisingly few safe locations for the WQ. White forces the Black Bishop to move setting up a mild attempt to win it on d4 while critically keeping the pressure on h7. 19. Qf4 might be stronger letting White keep his material advantage and tying down another Black piece after 19...Bxd4 20. Qxc7 Rb8 21. Rhe1.
202,5,24,1Bxd4,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n5/3b1Q2/3b4/1P1B3P/P4PP1/2KR3R w - -',Black threatens various pawns around the board and has finally equalized his material but his minor pieces are somewhat vulnerable to counterattack in their tenuous circle of protection.
203,5,25,2Bb5,b'r5qk/ppp4p/2n5/1B1b1Q2/3b4/1P5P/P4PP1/2KR3R b - -',?! White threatens to win one of Black's minor pieces but the threat is easily parried and this move by White frees the BQ momentarily from her defense of h7. See my note to White's move 19.
204,5,26,2Rf8,b'5rqk/ppp4p/2n5/1B1b1Q2/3b4/1P5P/P4PP1/2KR3R w - -',Black brings up his final piece to complete his development with tempo driving away the White Queen from her powerful center post and looking hungrily at White's second rank.
205,5,27,2Qh5,b'5rqk/ppp4p/2n5/1B1b3Q/3b4/1P5P/P4PP1/2KR3R b - -',The White Queen maintains pressure on h7 and d5. This is a stronger choice than 21. Qd7? as the latter does not prevent Black from beginning a dangerous attack of his own with ...Qg5+.
206,5,28,2Rxf2,b'6qk/ppp4p/2n5/1B1b3Q/3b4/1P5P/P4rP1/2KR3R w - -',Black threatens 22...Bb2+ and related violence which could be fatal if White plays carelessly: 22. Rhf1?? Bb2+ 23. Kb1 Be4+ 24. Bd3 Bxd3+ 25. Rxd3 Rxf1+ 26. Kxb2 Qxg2+ and Black has an easy win.
207,5,29,2Bxc6,b'6qk/ppp4p/2B5/3b3Q/3b4/1P5P/P4rP1/2KR3R b - -',?? White's best shot at living through Black's attack here was probably 22. Rdf1 giving his King some breathing room on d1. After 22...Rxa2 23. Bd3 White stands a chance of staving off Black's ravening pieces long enough to find a perpetual check. With 22. Bxc6 however White dooms himself to a painful death. After 22...Bb2+ 23. Kb1 Bxc6 24. Rd3 Be4 25. Rhd1 Qe6 White cannot prevent the Black Queen from entering the fight decisively via c6 g6 or e1: 26. Qc5 (to prevent ...Qc6 followed by ...Qc2#) ...Bxd3+ 27. Rxd3 Qe1+ 28. Qc1 Qxc1# or 26. Qg4 Bf5 27. Qh5 Bxd3+ 28. Rxd3 Qe4 29. Qd1 Re2 and whatever White plays now Black would have to blunder horrifically to lose the resulting Q vs R endgame. Best would probably be 26. Qb5 a6 27. Qc4 Qxc4 28. bxc4 Rxg2 and the LSB ties down White's Rooks while Black butchers all the pawns on the map.
208,5,30,2Bb2+,b'6qk/ppp4p/2B5/3b3Q/8/1P5P/Pb3rP1/2KR3R w - -',The Gameknot computer analysis alternately suggests 22...Qg3 or 22...Qe6 aiming for the weak e3 square.
209,5,31,2Kb1,b'6qk/ppp4p/2B5/3b3Q/8/1P5P/Pb3rP1/1K1R3R b - -',Forced.
210,5,32,2Bxc6,b'6qk/ppp4p/2b5/7Q/8/1P5P/Pb3rP1/1K1R3R w - -',Now Black threatens ...Be4+ and mate in one.
211,5,33,2Qh4,b'6qk/ppp4p/2b5/8/7Q/1P5P/Pb3rP1/1K1R3R b - -',? White holds out longer with 24. Rd3; see my note to White's twenty-second move. Possibly he was baited by the chance at a royal pin with Rd8 but it's irrelevant now--Black has a mate in three available to him.
212,5,34,2Qg6+,b'7k/ppp4p/2b3q1/8/7Q/1P5P/Pb3rP1/1K1R3R w - -',White is done for (25. Qe4 Qxe4+ 26. Rd3 Qxd3#) and he resigns. Black's superior development and open space proved adequate to win back the gambited material and secure victory from all the way across the board. Again many thanks to chanakam2000 for this game. Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated--if you leave a low rating please leave a comment as well explaining what I can improve! Thanks for reading!
213,6,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',When I started to play this game I was mired in a dismal losing streak mostly of my own making. At times not paying proper attention in the opening at other times losing my focus while transversing the labyrinths of the middle game. Chess demands that you stay alert and play with purpose or the gods of cassia will pick you up by the scruff of your neck and will shake all the confidence and hubris out of you. Again I open with the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. An opening I am currently learning in my quest to build an opening repertoire. I tend to annotate more from of a strategical and psychological point of view rarther than use variations. I also of course annotate from my point of view. I'm sure that my opponent would have his own side of things.
214,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The Standard reply.
215,6,2,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',Black sets up his center while I intend to attack it from the flanks. Classic hypermodern strategy on the part of White.
216,6,3,Bxe5,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b5/3pB3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',My opponent was not paying attention. I'm getting more familair with this opening and I get to capture one of his center pawns for nothing. This can't be a bad thing.
217,6,4,Nf3,b'r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2bb1p2/3p4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Development continues and already I'm getting somewhat nervous. Black's bishops are positioned menacingly at my king side. 
218,6,5,Na3,b'r2qk1nr/1pp3pp/p1bb1p2/3p4/8/NP2PN2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Although this knight move looks awkward I have often seen it when replaying master games involving the Nimzo-Larsen with white. The bishop's influence remains unencumbered upon the center.
219,6,6,1c4,b'r2qk2r/1pp1n1pp/p1bb1p2/3p4/2P5/NP2PN2/PB1P1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq c3',Standard procedure on the part of white in this opening. Attack black's center from the flank. 
220,6,7,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/ppbb1p2/3p4/2PN4/NP2P3/PBQP1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I decide to aggressively move my king's knight to d4 and attack my opponent's white bishop. This knight will play a major role in the course of this game and will forever be close to my heart.
221,6,8,1cxd5,b'r3k2r/1bpqn1pp/pp1b1p2/3P4/3N4/NP2P3/PBQP1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I take out his remaining center pawn.
222,6,9,1Nc4,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/pp1b1p2/3b4/2NN4/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',A bad mistake and I took two days to make this move. And I noticed my mistake just after I made my move funny how often that happens to me. Now black can play B*g2 forcing me to move my rook then he can play Q-h3 with a strong attack. I should have played e4 driving his bishop back and then played N-c4. I can get so wrapped up in a certain variation that I don't look at other possibilities. In short I can become so fixated on one variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all my other thoughts. This happens in my life as well. I'm thinking at the time 'oh no I've done it again'. I was already in a bad losing streak and saw it continueing with this move.
223,6,10,1b5,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/p2b1p2/1p1b4/2NN4/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I sweated it out for two days as my opponent takes awhile to make his moves. But remarkably he didn't see it and played b5 instead. I had been given a reprieve
224,6,11,1Nxd6+,b'r3k2r/2pqn1pp/p2N1p2/1p1b4/3N4/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',i eagerly take out one of his bishops while putting his king in check now he has to take my knight.

228,6,15,1c5,b'2r2rk1/1b2n1pp/p2q1p2/1pp5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBQ2PPP/2R1K2R w K c6',Black is grabbing space on the queen side but at a price. I'm already thinking that someday my knight might be able to infiltrate black's position on the queen side. In chess and especially with pawn moves when you gain something you often give something else up.
229,6,16,2Rfd1,b'2rr2k1/1b2n1pp/p2q1p2/1pp5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBQ2PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',We are firmly ensconced in the middlegame with our rooks developed and connected.

Black has more space on the queen side but may be opening himself up to an attack on the flank of his pawn structure on that side of the board. In the Nimzo-Larsen White will often hold his center pawns back. They can be used later in the middlegame to move up the center of the board at opportune times.
233,6,20,2Nf4,b'2rr3k/1b4pp/p2q1p2/2p5/1pQ1Pn2/1P1P1N2/PB3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',Oh I don't like this. While I have been wrapping myself up in queen side issues I forgot that my opponent has plans of his own. His knight has infiltrated my king side on f4 threatening my camp at d3 and e2. And there was a reason i listed d3 first because I didn't see the threat to e2 at the time. Again getting so caught up in a particular thought and acting on it too soon.

Black's pawns are giving him a lot of space and providing his pieces with mobility on that side of the board. I want to play d4 challenging him in the center while giving my own pieces a little more breathing room. What I'm worried about is giving his bishop more scope with that move. I decide the trade off is worth it.

244,6,31,3Bf4,b'3r3k/2r3p1/b1q2p1p/p7/1ppPPB2/1P3N2/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',I want to get my bishop more involved in things so I attack black's rook on c7.
245,6,32,3d5,b'2rr3k/6p1/b1q2p1p/p2P4/1pp1PB2/1P3N2/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',I now push my passed pawn attacking my opponent's queen. I'm beginning to make him make forced moves and it is empowering for me. The position on the board has changed some in just the last few moves.
246,6,33,3Nd4,b'2rrq2k/6p1/b4p1p/p2P4/1ppNPB2/1P6/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',My knight leaps into the fray at d4 with his eye on c6 and e6. He will prove to pay a pivotal role in this game and will be black's nemesis.
247,6,34,3c3,b'2rrq2k/6p1/b4p1p/p2P4/1p1NPB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K w - -',Black pushes another pawn giving him a passed pawn on c3. My queen will have to stay where she is to make sure that this scoundrel doesn't move further up the board.
248,6,35,3Nc6,b'2rrq2k/6p1/b1N2p1p/p2P4/1p2PB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',I counter by playing my knight to c6. He is now firmly ensconced in Black's camp and will be a thorn in his side. He is also attacking a rook and a very important pawn at a5 (the base of black's pawn chain on the queenside).
249,6,36,3Nxa5,b'2r1q2k/3r2p1/b4p1p/N2P4/1p2PB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',My knight captures the pawn weakening black's queenside pawn structure. Now my target is the pawn at b4 which supports the passed pawn on c3.
250,6,37,3Rc5,b'4q2k/3r2p1/b4p1p/N1rP4/1p2PB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K w - -',He attacks my knight.
251,6,38,3Nc6,b'4q2k/3r2p1/b1N2p1p/2rP4/1p2PB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',And back the knight goes to c6 striking out at various squares. My center pawns are playing a significant role supporting my knight and dominating the center of the board. Black does not have any center pawns of his own to contest the center of the board. 
252,6,39,3Rb7,b'4q2k/1r4p1/b1N2p1p/2rP4/1p2PB2/1Pp5/P1Q2PPP/3R3K w - -',I seldom comment on my opponenets moves but i think it would be wiser for him to attack my e4 pawn. I'm not sure what this rook move accomplishes.
253,6,40,3Be3,b'4q2k/1r4p1/b1N2p1p/2rP4/1p2P3/1Pp1B3/P1Q2PPP/3R3K b - -',Again I force him into making a move as my bishop attacks his rook. I feel I have taken charge of this game and I feel it stems back to my 32nd move when I pushed my pawn to d4.
254,6,41,4f3,b'4q2k/1r4p1/b1N2p1p/1r1P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P1Q3PP/3R3K b - -',I give my pawns in the center of the board which are the key to my position solid support. I feel my position is getting stronger as the game progresses. i also feel I am setting the agenda and am in charge and focused whereas my opponent has seemed to have lost the thread of his game.
255,6,42,4Rd7,b'4q2k/3r2p1/b1N2p1p/1r1P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P1Q3PP/3R3K w - -',Black again shifts his rook back to d7. I can almost feel his indecision.
256,6,43,4Qf2,b'4q2k/3r2p1/b1N2p1p/1r1P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P4QPP/3R3K b - -',I swing my queen behind my bishop. I want play my bishop to c5 attacking the base of black's pawn setup on the queenside and it will need to be protected.
257,6,44,4Bb7,b'4q2k/1b1r2p1/2N2p1p/1r1P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P4QPP/3R3K w - -',Have to be careful here. Black attacks my knight. If I leave it on c6 he will capture it and I will be forced to recapture with my d5 pawn then his rook will swoop down capturing my rook and putting me in check. The only way to stop him would be interposing with my queen and losing her in the ensuing exchange.
258,6,45,4Nd4,b'4q2k/1b1r2p1/5p1p/1r1P4/1p1NP3/1Pp1BP2/P4QPP/3R3K b - -',I retreat the knight to d4 while again attacking his rook on b5. How he must hate that knight.
259,6,46,4Ne6,b'4q2k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r2P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P4QPP/3R3K b - -',The knight moves yet again this time onto square e6. His unsettling influence on black is enabling me to pursue my own plans while black seems forever to be making forced moves to protect himself. 'The initiative' in chess is a key concept and when it is in your possession chess can be quite fun and empowering.
260,6,47,4Qc8,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r2P4/1p2P3/1Pp1BP2/P4QPP/3R3K w - -',My opponent moves his queen to backup his passed pawn on c3.
261,6,48,4Bc5,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r1BP4/1p2P3/1Pp2P2/P4QPP/3R3K b - -',I plug that file up with my bishop who is supported by you guessed itmy knight on e6. The other reason for moving my bishop to c5 was to attack the pawn supporting black's passed pawn. Having your pieces work in concert with each other is something I'm only now realizing. Piece activity in conjunction with your pawn structure.
262,6,49,4Rb5,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/1rBP4/1p2P3/1Pp2P2/P4QPP/3R3K w - -',His rook moves to protect his pawn at b4.
263,6,50,4Rd4,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/1rBP4/1p1RP3/1Pp2P2/P4QPP/7K b - -',I attack the pawn again with my rook lift to d4.
264,6,51,4Ba6,b'2q4k/3r2p1/b3Np1p/1rBP4/1p1RP3/1Pp2P2/P4QPP/7K w - -',Black moves his bishop off the blocked diagonal. His pieces seem to be in each other's way. I have played the Nimzo-Larsen a few times now and I find the concept of holding your center pawns back in the opening and later advancing them in the middlegame to be a very effective technique. Again remember back to the position I had before my 32nd move when I advanced my pawn to d4. It changed the direction and contour of the game.
265,6,52,4Qc2,b'2q4k/3r2p1/b3Np1p/1rBP4/1p1RP3/1Pp2P2/P1Q3PP/7K b - -',Now that the bishop is protected by my knight I shift my queen back to c2 due to the following sequence....46...r*b4 r*b4...47...b*b4 c2...My queen will be needed to blockade black's pawn at c3 after the fireworks of the exchange on b4.
266,6,53,4Rxc5,b'2q4k/3r2p1/b3Np1p/2rP4/1p1RP3/1Pp2P2/P1Q3PP/7K w - -',Black draws first blood by capturing my bishop. I thought for awhile before i responded. I wanted to keep my knight on e6 where I thought i would have further use of him. Plus I had grown quite fond of him.
267,6,54,4Rxb4,b'2q4k/3r2p1/b3Np1p/2rP4/1R2P3/1Pp2P2/P1Q3PP/7K b - -',My rook takes out the remaining pawn support for the pawn at c3.
268,6,55,4a4,b'2q4k/3r2p1/b3Np1p/r2P4/PR2P3/1Pp2P2/2Q3PP/7K b - a3',I plug up the a file restricting black's rooks mobility.
269,6,56,4Bb7,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r2P4/PR2P3/1Pp2P2/2Q3PP/7K w - -',My opponent now shifts his attack to my passed pawn on d5 but it is solidly defended by my center pawn on e4.
270,6,57,4Rc4,b'2q4k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r2P4/P1R1P3/1Pp2P2/2Q3PP/7K b - -',I attack his queen while stepping my attack on his last remaining (passed) pawn on the queenside.
271,6,58,5Qxc3,b'1q5k/1b1r2p1/4Np1p/r2P4/P1R1P3/1PQ2P2/6PP/7K b - -',My queen finishes off his pawn. I now have the c file firmly in hand with potential entry points on c6 and c7 thanks to my passed pawn and my beloved knight at e6.
272,6,59,5Rc7,b'rq5k/1bRr2p1/4Np1p/3P4/P3P3/1PQ2P2/6PP/7K b - -',I thrust my rook into the heart of his queenside which is ably backed up my queen and knight. Notice how much havoc my knight has caused my opponent. If you can park your knight deep into your oppponent's territory your game can almost play itself. I think Steinitz said that.
273,6,60,5Rxc7,b'rq5k/1br3p1/4Np1p/3P4/P3P3/1PQ2P2/6PP/7K w - -',He takes my rook.
274,6,61,5Nxc7,b'rq5k/1bN3p1/5p1p/3P4/P3P3/1PQ2P2/6PP/7K b - -',And my by now hated knight gobbles up his rook while attacking his other rook. He will have to move it.
275,6,62,5d6,b'1q5k/rbN3p1/3P1p1p/8/P3P3/1PQ2P2/6PP/7K b - -',My passed pawn moves up to d6 giving further support to my knight. This dynamic duo has spearheaded my offensive into black's territory.
276,6,63,5h3,b'1qb4k/r1N3p1/3P1p1p/8/P3P3/1PQ2P1P/6P1/7K b - -',Now that I have black tied up I decide to provide my King with an escape square as it might be needed later on. Don't want black's queen or rook swooping down cheating me out of all my hard work. I have lost many games while not paying enough attention to the safety of my king.
277,6,64,5Rb7,b'1qb4k/1rN3p1/3P1p1p/8/P3P3/1PQ2P1P/6P1/7K w - -',He attacks my backward pawn on b3.

This knight is going to go into my 'Chess hall of Fame"" as the only member. Hopefully I can make further addiitons later on in my chess career."
279,6,66,5Bd7,b'1q5k/1r1b2p1/3P1p1p/1N6/P3P3/1PQ2P1P/6P1/7K w - -',Black attacks the hated knight.
280,6,67,5Qc4,b'1q5k/1r1b2p1/3P1p1p/1N6/P1Q1P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K b - -',I move my queen up to give it a little more scope.
281,6,68,5Bxb5,b'1q5k/1r4p1/3P1p1p/1b6/P1Q1P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K w - -',A sad day...My knight which had given me what seemed like unending service goes down on his shield to Black's scoundrel bishop...My White King wipes a tear from his eye in his bunker at h1 while the Largo movement of Vivaldi's Trumpet Concerto in B Flat Minor plays in the background.
282,6,69,5axb5,b'1q5k/1r4p1/3P1p1p/1P6/2Q1P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K b - -',My rook's pawn hacks down the scondrel bishop and cuts off his head and shakes it at the Black King huddling in the corner. 
283,6,70,5Qxd6,b'7k/1r4p1/3q1p1p/1P6/2Q1P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K w - -',Black's queen takes my passed pawn. Sad to see such  loyal and hard working servants fall by the way side but chess is not just a game it's a war and pieces have to lay down for the greater good.
284,6,71,5Qc8+,b'2Q4k/1r4p1/3q1p1p/1P6/4P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K b - -',My queen swoops down and puts the despised Black king in check while attacking his rook as well.
285,6,72,5Qxb7,b'8/1Q4pk/3q1p1p/1P6/4P3/1P3P1P/6P1/7K b - -',The rook falls and newly created passed pawns are born out of the carnage. The die is cast for Black. I'm no endgame player but in a position like this I don't have to be.

289,6,76,6b6,b'8/6pk/1PQ2p1p/8/4P3/4qP1P/6PK/8 b - -',I push my pawn onward to glory and a game that will be dedicated to my king's knight whose efforts have made it all possible.
290,6,77,6b7,b'8/1P4pk/2Q2p1p/4q3/4P3/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',And the rest of it is just a matter of a lack of technique on my part but it was enough to win...or did I win?...The more I play this game of Chess the more I realize that I'm really playing against myself. Struggling against the things that hold me back against the shadows buried deep in my pysche. My opponent offers me a mirror to view the things I struggle against...in that regard he is more of a comrade than anything else.
291,6,78,7b8=Q,b'1Q6/2Q3pk/5p1p/8/1q2PP2/6KP/6P1/8 b - -',Fritz of course showed numerous mistakes on both sides but I have come to realize that when I go over a game I'm more interested in the 'story' of it rather than the clinical dissection of it. Chess like life is full of mistakes and drama..... and it was meant to be played by people not to be analyzed by a cold calculating machine that will never know what it is like to feel doubt and to be unsure of yourself. Chess is a metaphor for life with all it's accompanying problems and win or lose there will always be another game and probably another life as well....the way I see it anyway...

293,7,1,b6,b'r1b1k2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1p2p/4P3/2P1P3/2P2N1P/P4PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I want to play c5 but it is not possible at the moment. This seems the best developement for black since it is not likely to have f and e pawns removed by now. Black's bishop in b7 is not dangerous if white plays f3 but it leaves a weakness in g2. This is a result of a better pawn's structure even if white controls most of the center. 
294,7,2,1Nd4,b'r1b1k2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1p2p/4P3/2PNP3/2P4P/P4PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',A big mistake since it allows...

313,8,2,Nf3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This is the first deviation from the main line which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3.

White has spent a lot of time building pressure on e5 and trying to open the lane for his Bishop and now he allows me to shut it down almost entirely. This is the advantage of 5. f4; it leaves the a1-h8 diagonal gloriously free.
316,8,5,e4,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1p4/3Pp3/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',This seems like the most logical move. After the Knight retreats I need to be ready to try to prevent c4 which White will play as soon as he can to reopen the position. At this point I'm planning to drive White's Bishop away and then get a pawn on b5 to restrict c4.

At this point though I'm starting to think an open center wouldn't be such a bad thing--I need to make use of my Bishops.

326,8,15,Nf6,b'r3k2r/2p2ppp/p1bq1n2/1p1p4/P2Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',With the threat of the a-file opening up I decide it's high time to finish developing minor pieces and prepare to connect my rooks. This does lose a pawn for me but I'm hoping my extra space and mobility will make up for it.
327,8,16,axb5,b'r3k2r/2p2ppp/2bq1n2/1p1p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I'm not too happy about putting my Bishop on a8 but I think I can open up the game and I'd rather have BN vs NN than N vs N. Besides I don't actually have a choice (13. ...Bxb5?? 14. Nxb5 and I can't retake without losing both Rooks).
328,8,17,Qb6,b'b3k2r/2p2ppp/1q3n2/1N1p4/3Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/3QK2R w Kk -',I need to keep c7 defended and I'd like to chase this Knight far away with 16. Nc3 Qb4 17. Na2 Qa5.
329,8,18,1Qa1,b'b3k2r/2p2ppp/1q3n2/1N1p4/3Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/Q3K2R b Kk -',White preemptively defends c3 for his Knight's retreat.
330,8,19,1O-O,b'b4rk1/2p2ppp/1q3n2/1N1p4/3Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/Q3K2R w K -',If 16...Qxb5?? White has 17. Qxa8+ followed by Qxh8. My late castling has seriously limited my options.
331,8,20,1Nc3,b'b4rk1/2p2ppp/1q3n2/3p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/Q3K2R b K -',Now White retreats. A stronger play I think was 17. c4! which Black cannot answer effectively with 17...c6 18. c5 and White's passed pawns are a huge threat.
332,8,21,1Na4,b'b4rk1/2p2ppp/5n2/3p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/Q3K2R b K -',The Knight searches desperately for a useful home where it doesn't tie the WQ to passive defense. 18. Ne2 might have been better.
333,8,22,1Bc6,b'5rk1/2p2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/Q3K2R w K -',I attempt to continue to lock the WQ into a passive role (19. Nb2 Qc3). White can play 19. c3 here instead breaking the pin on his d2 Knight.
334,8,23,1Qd1,b'5rk1/2p2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/3QK2R b K -',White feels like he can give back the pawn and I agree with him. He clearly wants to castle so he chooses to defend the Nd2 in preparation for that. 19. c3 would accomplish much the same thing but of course the BQ can simply retreat to b5 and prevent castling anyway.
335,8,24,1Bb5,b'5rk1/2p2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/3QK2R w K -',White is telegraphing his desperation--if he's willing to give up a pawn for the opportunity to castle I'm certainly not going to give him that opportunity if I can help it.
336,8,25,2f3,b'5rk1/2p2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2PP2/2PN2PP/3QK2R b K -',White decides to try to break my pawn center while preparing to castle artificially through f2.
337,8,26,2Re8,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/Nq1Pp3/1P2PP2/2PN2PP/3QK2R w K -',There's still no reason for me to trade off my Bishop for White's miserable Knight on a4 and White can't force the issue so I turn my sights to the kingside. 20. f3 left White's e-pawn very weak so I bring up another heavy piece to drill it as soon as the center opens.
338,8,27,2Nc5,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/1q1Pp3/1P2PP2/2PN2PP/3QK2R b K -',White tries to get his Knight into play ineffectually attacking e4 and little else. I think 21. Kf2 was better here getting out of both pins (the direct one from b4-e1 and the indirect one from e8-e1).
339,8,28,2exf3,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/1q1P4/1P2Pp2/2PN2PP/3QK2R w K -',It's go time. White loses at least a pawn now.
340,8,29,Qxd4,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/3q4/1P2PQ2/2PN2PP/4K2R w K -',I finally let up the pin on the Ne2 but it has nowhere to go. The WK still can't castle out of his predicament and now I'm threatening both ...Qxe3+ and ...Qxc5. White can't defend adequately.
341,8,30,2Kf2,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/3q4/1P2PQ2/2PN1KPP/7R b - -',?? White was under time pressure here but this move loses a lot more than the Knight.
342,8,31,2Qe2,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/8/1P2P3/2PqQKPP/7R b - -',? Overlooking the Bishop but it doesn't matter. The WQ is actually done for anyway after 24. Kg3 Rxe3 (or 24. Kg1 Qe1+ 25. Qf1 Qxf1#).
343,8,32,2Qxe2+,b'4r1k1/2p2ppp/5n2/1bNp4/8/1P2P3/2P1qKPP/7R w - -',And White resigns as mate is inevitable. Thanks for a fun game leapingtrout and thank you dear reader for reading. Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are greatly appreciated. Until next time!

359,10,0,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq a3',A dreadful opening move even for blitz.
360,10,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Would 2. B4 undermine black's attempt to set up a Sicilian/English opening..?
361,10,2,a5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/P1p5/8/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Is white congenitally immuno-compromised..? 
362,10,3,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/P1p5/8/6P1/1PPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Finally a sensible move; 3.g3 followed by Bg2 could work together with the a5 push weakening the B7 square...
363,10,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/P1pp4/8/6P1/1PPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This move seems natural as I wish to avoid ...e6.

366,10,7,a6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/P1n2n2/2pp4/6b1/2P3P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',A crap move.

372,10,13,Bd7,b'r3k2r/p2bbppp/Ppn5/2pq4/Q7/5PP1/1P1PP2P/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',The black position plays itself.

378,10,19,2f4,b'r3r1k1/p4p1p/Pp1qbbpP/2p1n3/4PP2/R1Q3P1/1P1PN3/2B1K2R b K -',White is getting some counter play here after ...Ng4.

382,10,23,Bc4,b'r3r1k1/p4p1p/Pp1q2pP/2p5/2b5/R4QP1/1B1PN3/4K2R w K -',For the moment white cannot play Qf6.

387,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was a fun blitz game I played some time ago and I happened to grab the pgn so you guys get to enjoy it! Please bear in mind that this was five-minute blitz--poor decisions were made on both sides. I stick to a book I'm familiar with since there's time pressure to consider and we get into a very delicate Sicilian with a lot of action all across the board finally culminating in a frightening sequence of missed opportunities as our clocks run out.
388,11,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black obliges me with the Sicilian.
389,11,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I prefer open positions in time pressure so I go straight for it.
390,11,3,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',2. d4 gives me the psychological advantage (or so I like to think) of being able to play this move. It would be risky to keep the Queen out so early of course but I think the aggressive posture was worth the tempo.
391,11,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Developing with tempo.
392,11,5,Qd1,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm behind a little in development but I'm confident in my ability to catch up. Black still has pawns to move before he can get his Bishops out. I considered playing 4. Qa4 briefly but decided to err on the side of caution.
393,11,6,Qc7,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The intent behind this move isn't particularly clear to me. It doesn't threaten anything in particular and doesn't help Black get his Bishops developed. Perhaps my early Queen action is already provoking my opponent into rash behavior.
394,11,7,c4,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Black is giving me a chance to constrict his position so I jump on it. This move has the additional benefit of preventing ...Nb5 from being any kind of threat (aiming at c2). I think 5. f4 would have been strong here as well.
395,11,8,e6,b'r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Freeing the Bishop and preparing for an eventual ...d5.

397,11,10,b6,b'r1b1kbnr/p1qp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black plans to fianchetto his LSB while giving the half-open c file to his Rook and Queen.

399,11,12,Bb7,b'r3kbnr/pbqp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Logical.

I allow Black to double my e-pawns at the cost of his Bishop but I'm now ready to castle into a very safe spot and I have my sights set on e5 and Black's d-pawn.

I have visions of trading off my Bishop for his kingside Knight and then somehow maneuvering a Knight of my own to d5 (after provoking ...e5 somehow) which should give me a strong attack while keeping most of his pieces out of the picture.
412,11,25,1d6,b'3r1rk1/1bq2ppp/ppnpp1n1/6N1/2P1P3/P1N1P3/1P1QB1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',I couldn't have been happier about this move. Black announces his intention to play ...e5 and blocks the Queen from her diagonal. I think he was worried about a Rook sacrifice on f7 which to be fair I was eying somewhat hungrily.

I don't think it's in real danger at this point but the text move does at least bring another piece over to where the action is and produce a couple of threats that I have to deal with.
415,11,28,1b3,b'3r1rk1/1bq2ppp/pp1pp1n1/4n1NB/2P1P3/PPN1P3/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 b - -',This reinforcement is simple enough but how am I going to coax the Black Knight away from e5?
416,11,29,1Bc8,b'2br1rk1/2q2ppp/pp1pp1n1/4n1NB/2P1P3/PPN1P3/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 w - -',My pawn on e4 is unassailable at the moment (note that 17...f5 loses to 18. Nxe6 winning material and shattering Black's position) and ...d5 is impossible so Black abandons the long diagonal in favor of consolidating his Kingside.
417,11,30,1Nf3,b'2br1rk1/2q2ppp/pp1pp1n1/4n2B/2P1P3/PPN1PN2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 b - -',I attack the Knight the only way I can.
418,11,31,1Nc6,b'2br1rk1/2q2ppp/ppnpp1n1/7B/2P1P3/PPN1PN2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 w - -',...And he obligingly retreats. Had the Knight remained I probably would have played 19. Nxe5 hoping for 19...dxe5 20. Qf2 Rxd1 21. Nxd1 with a fair attack on f7 and Black's Bishop hopelessly stuffed by his own pawns.
419,11,32,1Bxg6,b'2br1rk1/2q2ppp/ppnpp1B1/8/2P1P3/PPN1PN2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 b - -',Trading off the defender.

426,11,39,2Nf7,b'2br1rk1/2q2np1/pp1pp1pp/8/2P1P3/PP2PN2/3QN1PP/3R1RK1 w - -',And Black denies it again this time stifling his Rook but giving him a better array of possible positions to relocate to.
427,11,40,2Ned4,b'2br1rk1/2q2np1/pp1pp1pp/8/2PNP3/PP2PN2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 b - -',This Knight is going to d5 remember. This attack on e6 is the perfect tool to convince Black to finally play ...e5. The original plan was to bring this Knight to f4 instead but since Black advanced the h-pawn 23. Nf4 is met with 23...g5 which doesn't further my goal at all.
428,11,41,2e5,b'2br1rk1/2q2np1/pp1p2pp/4p3/2PNP3/PP2PN2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Another possible option is 23...d5 but I think that fails against 24. Nxe6! Bxe6 25. exd4 and my passed pawns should be plenty of compensation for the Knight.
429,11,42,2Ne2,b'2br1rk1/2q2np1/pp1p2pp/4p3/2P1P3/PP2PN2/3QN1PP/3R1RK1 b - -',I pull back again. I can almost taste d5 and the subsequent attack.

431,11,44,Bxf3,b'3r1rk1/2q2np1/pp1p2pp/4p3/2P1P3/PPN1Pb2/3Q2PP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black trades a Bishop that could have been useful for a Knight with no prospects and lets me lift my Rook in the process. He's trying to trade down to lessen the pressure but he has no way to get at the pieces that actually matter. 25...Qc5 might have been a good alternative here.
432,11,45,Qc6,b'3r1rk1/5np1/ppqp2pp/4p3/2P1P3/PPN1PR2/3Q2PP/3R2K1 w - -',A meaningless threat. Again I think the Queen would be better positioned on c5.
433,11,46,2Nd5,b'3r1rk1/5np1/ppqp2pp/3Np3/2P1P3/PP2PR2/3Q2PP/3R2K1 b - -',Finally! From here my Knight is untouchable and thanks to Black's last move now I threaten a family fork at e7.
434,11,47,2Rde8,b'4rrk1/5np1/ppqp2pp/3Np3/2P1P3/PP2PR2/3Q2PP/3R2K1 w - -',Practically forced. If 27...Rd7 I can pile up on the f file with a devastating pin on the f7 Knight.
435,11,48,2Qf2,b'4rrk1/5np1/ppqp2pp/3Np3/2P1P3/PP2PR2/5QPP/3R2K1 b - -',? With my Knight comfortably entrenched at d5 I shift my focus to Black's castle. Looking back on it 28. Rf1 might have been a better choice since the Queen move loses me the f-file after 28...Ng5 29. Rxf8 Rxf8 and suddenly I don't have an attack any more.
436,11,49,2Qb7,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/pp1p2pp/3Np3/2P1P3/PP2PR2/5QPP/3R2K1 w - -',? Defending the f7 Knight though again I think just playing 28...Ng5 outright is much stronger here.
437,11,50,2Rf1,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/pp1p2pp/3Np3/2P1P3/PP2PR2/5QPP/5RK1 b - -',Now it's too late for Black to play ...Ng5.
438,11,51,2g5,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/pp1p3p/3Np1p1/2P1P3/PP2PR2/5QPP/5RK1 w - -',Black's Knight can't move anyway so I guess there are worse moves than this. I think trying to divert my attention to the queenside with 29...b5 might be stronger (though after 30. cxb5 axb5 (not 30...Qxb5? 31. Rxf7 Qxf1+ 32. Qxf1 Rxf7 although this line is interesting it still loses for Black) Black is still hard-pressed to continue with any sort of attack).
439,11,52,3h3,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/pp1p3p/3Np1p1/2P1P3/PP2PR1P/5QP1/5RK1 b - -',Preventing ...g4 not because it's really a threat (30...g4 31. Rf5 g6 32. Rf6 and I proceed to tear Black's position apart) but because I'm pretty much waiting Black out--he's under serious time pressure and I'm expecting him to make a mistake.
440,11,53,3b5,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/p2p3p/1p1Np1p1/2P1P3/PP2PR1P/5QP1/5RK1 w - -',No reason this couldn't have happened last move.

442,11,55,3Qxc4,b'4rrk1/1q3np1/p2p3p/3Np1p1/2Q1P3/PP2PR1P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',My Queen has been lured to the other side of the board but at least from here I can still pressure Black's Knight and King.
443,11,56,3Qb5,b'4rrk1/5np1/p2p3p/1q1Np1p1/2Q1P3/PP2PR1P/6P1/5RK1 w - -',?! Black offers an exchange of Queens in an attempt to diffuse my attack.
444,11,57,3Qc3,b'4rrk1/5np1/p2p3p/1q1Np1p1/4P3/PPQ1PR1P/6P1/5RK1 b - -',I'm reluctant to give up my Queen so I miss the alternate line 33. Nc7 Qxc4 34. bxc4 Re7 (34...Rc8 35. Ne6 Rfe8 36. Nxg7 Kxg7 37. Rxf7+) 35. Nxa6 Ra7 36. Nb4 Rxa3 37. Rd1 which looks drawish to me unless one of us slips.

448,11,61,3a5,b'4rrk1/5np1/3p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/qP1QPR1P/8/5RK1 w - -',I think 35...Rb8 or 35...Ra8 would have been stronger here. Black cannot allow my Queen onto his back ranks (as will become clear shortly).
449,11,62,3Qa6,b'4rrk1/5np1/Q2p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/qP2PR1P/8/5RK1 b - -',This is just where I want to be behind enemy lines and sheltered from Black's Queen.
450,11,63,3Qxb3,b'4rrk1/5np1/Q2p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/1q2PR1P/8/5RK1 w - -',The Queen keeps gobbling pawns assuming the forces arrayed around her King will be sufficient to protect him.
451,11,64,3Qa7,b'4rrk1/Q4np1/3p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/1q2PR1P/8/5RK1 b - -',I don't need to take the a-pawn; I can do that at my leisure. Right now I have the advantage of Black's Queen being stuck on the wrong side of the board so I'm going to use it.
452,11,65,3Nd8,b'3nrrk1/Q5p1/3p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/1q2PR1P/8/5RK1 w - -',? This move hangs a Rook but Black doesn't have a lot of options. 37...Qb8 is a little better but still loses to 38. Rxf7.
453,11,66,3Rf3xf8+,b'3nrRk1/Q5p1/3p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/1q2P2P/8/5RK1 b - -',This Rook looks defended well enough but thanks to the most excellent Knight in the game it turns out not to be.
454,11,67,3Rxf8,b'3n1rk1/Q5p1/3p3p/p2Np1p1/4P1P1/1q2P2P/8/5RK1 w - -',The only move. 38...Kh7 is met with 39. Nf6+ Kg6 40. Nxe8 Ne6 (to prevent mate on g7) 41. R8f6+ Kh7 (41...gxf6 42. Rxf6#) 42. Rxe6 and Black is done for.

456,11,69,Ne6,b'5R2/Q3N1pk/3pn2p/p3p1p1/4P1P1/1q2P2P/8/6K1 w - -',Not only is this the Knight's only safe square but it also defends g7 and tells the White Rook to shove off. It's not good enough though.
457,11,70,4Nf5,b'5R2/Q5pk/3pn2p/p3pNp1/4P1P1/1q2P2P/8/6K1 b - -',?? I think my Rook is safe because of the mate threat but this move leads to needless complications and gives Black a chance at a draw. There's a forced mate in five starting with 41. Rh8+ that I completely missed.
458,11,71,4Qb1+,b'5R2/Q5pk/3pn2p/p3pNp1/4P1P1/4P2P/8/1q4K1 w - -',Black begins to throw checks around in the hopes of catching me in a perpetual check or winning back enough material to get back in the game now that my Knight is blocking my Rook from interposing.
459,11,72,Qxe4,b'5R2/Q5pk/3pn2p/p3pNp1/4q1P1/4P2P/5K2/8 w - -',? Black might have caught me in a draw with 42...Qc2+ 43. Kf3 Qd1+ 44. Kf2 Qd2+ etc. White can play 43. Kg3 and avoid it but under time pressure I probably would have opted for defending the e4 pawn and given up the draw.
460,11,73,4Nxd6,b'5R2/Q5pk/3Nn2p/p3p1p1/4q1P1/4P2P/5K2/8 b - -',I had entirely forgotten about my Rook at this point so I allow Black a combination that lets him back in the game.

463,11,76,4Qf7,b'5n2/5Qpk/3N3p/p3p1p1/6P1/4P1KP/2q5/8 b - -',? I think 45. Nf5 is a little better but it's still probably not good enough to win after 45...Ne6 46. Qxa5 e4 and Black should draw at least.
464,11,77,4Ng6,b'8/5Qpk/3N2np/p3p1p1/6P1/4P1KP/2q5/8 w - -',?? Black can afford to dump his Knight: 45...a4 46. Qxf8 Qc7 47. Nf5 Qa7 and the game should be a draw. The text move gives me a clear win:
465,11,78,4Nf5,b'8/5Qpk/6np/p3pNp1/6P1/4P1KP/2q5/8 b - -',Black having no choice but to sacrifice his Queen to avoid immediate checkmate resigns. Thanks for the exciting game ccheall and I hope everyone enjoys the analysis! Comments and ratings are much appreciated.
466,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I begin with the most common move which controls the centre and prepares to develop the light square bishop.
467,12,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A standard move.
468,12,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Attacks the pawn and develops my knigh to a useful square.
469,12,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',More preferable is 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6 ( Petrovs defense) 2.... d6 is extremely solid although white gain an advantage in space.
470,12,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Strikes the weak f7 square and prepares to castle. White is leading in development but blacks game is fundamentally solid.
471,12,5,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A rather dubious move. Black has only moved pawns so far whereas white has already developed 2 minor pieces and is ready to castle and bring the rook to support the pawns. The point of h6 was probably to stop ng5 which wins a pawn at least if played in the future.
472,12,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Develops the knight. 4. O-O was probably better followed by c3 Re1 then d4.
473,12,7,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black should develop some pieces first. Black has significantly weakened his pawn structure with all these pawn moves. It's understandable that black wants to counterattack in the centre with an eventual d5 but I think 4... Nf6 was more appropriate since it develops a piece.
474,12,8,O-O,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle to get my rook ready to swing into the action.

After I had played Qe2 I began to worry as I had seen the discovered attack a second after I had clicked submit. But after a while I had seen it was actually going to give me a better game if the knight was taken if he played b4.

496,12,30,2bxc3,b'r1k4r/5Q2/bBp2bpp/p3q2n/4P3/PBP5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 b - -',"I looked at the possibilities of a check followed by Rb1 making use of the open B file. I played 22.Bxc3 instead of 22. Be6 because I wanted my plan to be ""less obvious"""
497,12,31,2Be7,b'r1k4r/4bQ2/bBp3pp/p3q2n/4P3/PBP5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 w - -',A good defensive move that shuts off the 7th rank to the queen(temporarily) My attack seems to have run out of gas after 22... Be7 so I planned to use the positional advantage I had to a material advantage after Bd4( I thought)
498,12,32,2Bd4,b'r1k4r/4bQ2/b1p3pp/p3q2n/3BP3/PBP5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 b - -',I didn't see something here. This seemingly gains a rook but...
499,12,33,2Bc5,b'r1k4r/5Q2/b1p3pp/p1b1q2n/3BP3/PBP5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 w - -',Pins the bishop to the king. Now black seems to be in a better position.
500,12,34,2Qe6+,b'r1k4r/8/b1p1Q1pp/p1b1q2n/3BP3/PBP5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 b - -',I thought about this move for a while. It seemed the best since I could win my bishop back after 24. Qe6+ Qxe6 25. Bxe6+ I capture the queen with check and I can win the bishop immediately since the king has to decamp to b7.
501,12,35,2Bxc5,b'r6r/1k6/b1p1B1pp/p1B4n/4P3/P1P5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 b - -',I am definetely positionally winning and I'm ahead two pawns in material. This is easily won for white.
502,12,36,2Rae8,b'4r2r/1k6/b1p1B1pp/p1B4n/4P3/P1P5/2P3PP/3RR1K1 w - -',Black committs a serious blunder. Much better here was Rd8 which trades off rooks.

522,13,15,1Nc4,b'2b1r1k1/1p1n1pbp/2p3p1/3np3/1qN5/3P1NP1/1B2PPBP/Q4RK1 b - -',pressures e5

525,13,18,1Nd5b6,b'2b1r1k1/1p1n2bp/1np2pp1/4p3/1qN1P3/3P1NP1/1B3PBP/Q4RK1 w - -',during the game I for some reason thought this was unplayable I think I missed that this knight was protected by it's counterpart on d7.

550,15,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',And here is d5 going into the Scandinavian Defence. I used to play the Sicilian with quite good results but now i changed the opening to avoid the tones of variation that Sicilian has! I played Scandinavian for few reasons otherwise i had to choose between e5 e6 c6 g6 and so on.
551,15,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',He took it i think its the most common reply to that defence. Others are e5 and d4.
552,15,3,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I took it too. I avoid Nf6 cause sometimes its more dangerous and i am not used to it.
553,15,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Common reply too.
554,15,5,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Qa5 i think its the most playable and accepted reply to Nc3. Going back to d8 does not help and Qe5+ i think its not so good. Other reply is Qd6 but i didnt manage to play it too.
555,15,6,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',d4 is logical
556,15,7,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Nf6 is more correct to c6.
557,15,8,Bd2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I think its quite early for White to threat the Queen. Anyway its a playable move. Others here are Nf3 and Bc4.
558,15,9,Bg4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P2b1/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',According to my books this is the best reply. Bg4!? is quite tricky cause it's an aggressive one. Larsen play that move against Karpov and win the game! Maybe Bf5 is more correct but Bg5 usually forces White to play f3. Anyway black may lose a tempo here but here has to be careful too.
559,15,10,f3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P2b1/2N2P2/PPPB2PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',f3 as i said is a common reply.
560,15,11,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q4b2/3P4/2N2P2/PPPB2PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',And Bf5. No White has to play Bc4 and Ne2 or Bc4 and Qe2 going for 0-0-0. Black has to play c6 and e6 to compete the pawn on d4.
561,15,12,Nb5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/qN3b2/3P4/5P2/PPPB2PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Nb5 is quite out out of theory i guess and not a common reply. My first thought was that White did not know how to play the Scandinavian Defence after the early moves and the other thought was that White wanted to deviate from main lines etc.
562,15,13,Qb6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q3n2/1N3b2/3P4/5P2/PPPB2PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Qb6 is the only logical move here.
563,15,14,Bf4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q3n2/1N3b2/3P1B2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Now Bf4 is threatening the c7 pawn. My opinion is that White should go on with his development and then try to be more aggressive. White moved his DSB on d2 and then on f4 without a clear plan. Of course me as black played Bg4 and the Nf5 but that was into a GM level play. Anyway maybe i am wrong too. But look White's Kingside is quite disable so far.
564,15,15,Nd5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q6/1N1n1b2/3P1B2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Nd5 is logical move threatening the Bishop on f4 and protecting the c7 pawn.
565,15,16,Bg3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q6/1N1n1b2/3P4/5PB1/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Bg3 is the best here.
566,15,17,c6,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1qp5/1N1n1b2/3P4/5PB1/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',With c6 now the c7 square is not in danger anymore. And i dont think he's gonna exchange his Bishop for my Knight on b8.
567,15,18,1c4,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1qp5/1N1n1b2/2PP4/5PB1/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq c3',c4 a good move here and i expected that.
568,15,19,1cxb5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1q6/1p1n1b2/2PP4/5PB1/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Taking on b5 is the best reply here. What do you think?
569,15,20,1cxd5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1q6/1p1P1b2/3P4/5PB1/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',He takes on d5 and now is a critical decision for me what is the best move here.
570,15,21,1e6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1p1P1b2/3P4/5PB1/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',So i think e6 is good here opening the line for my Bishop and threatening on d5 too.
571,15,22,1Rc1,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1p1P1b2/3P4/5PB1/PP4PP/2RQKBNR b Kkq -',Rc1 is good taking the c-file with the rook. But i have to notice still his Kingside is bad structured. This is beacuse of my Bg4 at the opening and his f3 move. Also he cant castle anymore i guess!
572,15,23,1Bb4+,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1p1P1b2/1b1P4/5PB1/PP4PP/2RQKBNR w Kkq -',Going for check is good here developing my piece and also displacing his King.
573,15,24,1Kf2,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1p1P1b2/1b1P4/5PB1/PP3KPP/2RQ1BNR b kq -',Kf2 is one of his ways.

665,20,4,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! White is playing extremely aggressively but the e-pawn was in no real danger (...fxe4 isolates Black's pawn far from any support and will be won back easily) and White needs to develop in order to compete with what is about to become a very active Black position.
666,20,5,Qd4,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',With no Knight and d4 blocked White doesn't have a comfortable way to dislodge this Queen.
667,20,6,Qe2,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This is the only way to protect the pawn until White can find time for f4 but it does the LSB no favors.
668,20,7,Be6,b'r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black blockades the troublesome e-pawn and puts another piece between his King and the WQ.
669,20,8,c3,b'r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3q4/2P5/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Kicking the Queen but hampering White's development further.
670,20,9,Qb6,b'r3kbnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/8/2P5/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',!? Black allows his Queen to be somewhat marginalized but threatens White's b-pawn tying the WQ to its defense should the Bishop get out after White's d4. With only a couple pieces in play Black is making it exceedingly uncomfortable for White to complete his development.
671,20,10,d4,b'r3kbnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq d3',Reinforcing the e-pawn though this seems susceptible to attack from ...c5.
672,20,11,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',White is still far behind in development and Black's pieces are looking hungrily at the WK--which is still at least three moves from castling.
673,20,12,Bg5,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4PpB1/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',?! White develops while trying to gain some tempo but Black has an easy response. What's worse this move ties the Queen to the defense of b2 and prevents White from playing an immediate Nd2 as a result.
674,20,13,1Bxe7,b'2kr2nr/ppp1B1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',I don't like this choice by White to trade off his only active piece. Perhaps 10.Be3 would be better threatening 11.d5.
675,20,14,1Nxe7,b'2kr3r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',Black is almost fully developed while only White's Queen is off her starting square--and she's not looking great either.
676,20,15,1b3,b'2kr3r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/1PP5/P3QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',? White tries to loosen up his position a bit but it would have been better to simply bite the bullet and take the time to develop with 11.Qc2 followed by Bd3 and Nd2 as now Black can counter with...
677,20,16,1Rxd4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3r4/1PP5/P3QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',! This sham sacrifice wins the pawn and gives Black undisputed control of the d-file. If 12.cxd4? Qxd4 and Black wins back his Rook with interest.
678,20,17,1Nd2,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3r4/1PP5/P2NQPPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Now White can take the Rook but his queenside pawns and e-pawn are looking very weak.
679,20,18,1Rf4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/5r2/1PP5/P2NQPPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',?! I still don't know how to feel about this move. Black continues to apply pressure to White's cramped position and prevents f4 for the moment but he gives up the d-file and allows White to develop his Bishop with tempo.
680,20,19,Rg4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/6r1/1PP3P1/P2NQP1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',Not 13...Bd5? (thinking to invade h1 and deny White's castle) because of 14.f3! simultaneously blocking the threat and winning the Rook.
681,20,20,1f4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/5Pr1/1PP3P1/P2NQ2P/R3KB1R b KQ f3',?! Shoring up the advanced e-pawn yet again and locking Black's Rook out of the center. This does completely shatter any safety that was to be had in the White kingside though as Black can reach the h1-a8 diagonal first and now also controls all of g1-a7 as well. I think 14.Bg2 was better here.
682,20,21,1Bd5,b'2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp5/3bPp2/5Pr1/1PP3P1/P2NQ2P/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black seizes the diagonal for his Bishop. The tempting 14...g5?? (trying to undermine e5 yet again) loses badly to 15.Bh3.
683,20,22,h5,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/1qp5/3bPp1p/5Pr1/1PP2NP1/P3Q2P/R3KB1R w KQ h6',?! Black's Rook is in a precarious spot with only one retreat square but it's safe for now and with both Rooks on the kingside he plans to break through White's pawns and get all his pieces into the attack before the King can escape the center.
684,20,23,1Bh3,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/1qp5/3bPp1p/5Pr1/1PP2NPB/P3Q2P/R3K2R b KQ -',Finally the Bishop gets out of the corner. After the Rook moves this Bishop will actually be of some use pinning Black's f-pawn.
685,20,24,1Rf1,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/1qp3r1/3bPp1p/5P2/1PP2NPB/P3Q2P/R3KR2 b Q -',White unpins his Knight and threatens Nd4 winning the f-pawn.
686,20,25,1Qc5,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/2qbPp1p/5P2/1PP2NPB/P3Q2P/R3KR2 w Q -',Forcing White to deal with his weak c3 pawn before anything else happens and provoking the natural response...
687,20,26,1c4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/2qbPp1p/2P2P2/1P3NPB/P3Q2P/R3KR2 b Q -',White kicks the powerfully-centralized Bishop though it won't go far...
688,20,27,1Qb4+,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/3bPp1p/1qP2P2/1P3NPB/P3Q2P/R3KR2 w Q -',! Clearing the WQ away from her defense of e4.
689,20,28,2Kxd2,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/3bPp1p/2P2P2/1P3NPB/P2K3P/R4R2 b - -',?! This is surprising. White wants to keep his Knight available for kingside maneuvers but putting his King on the open d-file is dangerous at best.
690,20,29,2Be4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/4Pp1p/2P1bP2/1P3NPB/P2K3P/R4R2 w - -',With the WQ gone Black's Bishop is now free to occupy this powerful location.
691,20,30,2Ng5,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/4PpNp/2P1bP2/1P4PB/P2K3P/R4R2 b - -',Another surprise though it's clear why White wants to trade off the Black Bishop. He leaves his King dangerously exposed though. I expected 21.Rae1 or maybe 21.Ke3 (thinking to work his way over to g1).
692,20,31,2h4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/4PpN1/2P1bP1p/1P4PB/P2K3P/R4R2 w - -',! Black has decided that 21...Rd8+ doesn't offer enough promise as the WK can easily flee to his kingside and hide amongst his pieces there. Instead Black tries to disrupt the White position and get an advantage for the endgame--now if White wants to eliminate the Black Bishop he'll let the Rooks in to wreak havoc on his kingside (22.Nxe4 hxg3 23.hxg3 Rxh3 and now the Knight must retreat allowing 24...Rhxg3).
693,20,32,2Rae1,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/4PpN1/2P1bP1p/1P4PB/P2K3P/4RR2 b - -',White seeks to eliminate the pesky Bishop once and for all but Black's aggressive Rooks will be too strong for White's passive ones especially the Rf1 blocking the WB's escape route.
694,20,33,2hxg3,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p3r1/4PpN1/2P1bP2/1P4pB/P2K3P/4RR2 w - -',Black forges ahead with his kingside break. White has several options here none of them particularly pleasant. For instance 23.hxg3 Rxg5! 24. fxg5 (24.Bxf5+ Rxf5 25.Rxe4 Rh2+ 26.Re2 Rxe2+ 27.Kxe2 c5 gives Black a clearly won endgame) ...Rxh3 and Black's powerful Bishop is unassailable on e4 while the Knight and King clean up White's pawns. Alternately White could try 23.Nxe4 g2! 24.Bxg2 (24.Rg1 is met with ...Rxh3 25.Nf2 Rxh2) ...Rxg2+ 25.Nf2 Rhxh2 26.Re2 and White's pieces are hopelessly passive tied down to defending each other while the Black Knight and King and again free to roam the board.
695,20,34,Rxg5,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Ppr1/2P1bP2/1P4PB/P2K4/4RR2 w - -',"! This Rook ""sacrifices"" itself for the second time. Black has too many threats to counter at once. He'll get at least two minor pieces and a pawn for his Rook if White takes it."
696,20,35,2Rxe4,b'2k4r/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Ppr1/2P1RP2/1P4PB/P2K4/5R2 b - -',?! White counters by removing the powerful light-square Bishop but now he'll be down a Knight as the endgame approaches.
697,20,36,2Rxh3,b'2k5/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Ppr1/2P1RP2/1P4Pr/P2K4/5R2 w - -',Black cleans up the Bishop and unpins his f-pawn while threatening to win g3 as well.
698,20,37,2Re3,b'2k5/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Ppr1/2P2P2/1P2R1Pr/P2K4/5R2 b - -',? White chooses to avoid more trades and save his Rook but trying to defend the g-pawn is a futile gesture. Better may have been 25.Rd4 trying for some counterplay on the d-file.
699,20,38,2Rgxg3,b'2k5/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P2R1rr/P2K4/5R2 w - -',Black removes his own Rook from danger gains a pawn and now threatens to win the Re3 as well as the a2 pawn.
700,20,39,2Rxg3,b'2k5/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P4Rr/P2K4/5R2 b - -',If White wanted to exchange Rooks it would have been more accurate to play 25.fxg5 fxe4 26.Ke3 Rxg3+ 27.Kxe4 where at least White has a good centralized position for his King.
701,20,40,2Ke2,b'2k5/ppp1n1p1/2p5/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P4r1/P3K3/5R2 b - -',Allowing White to interpose his Rook after ...Rg2+ though trading off more material isn't going to help him much.
702,20,41,Kd7,b'8/pppkn1p1/2p5/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P6/P4K2/8 w - -',With almost no pieces remaining on the board the Black King finally mobilizes to attempt to escort a pawn through the White camp.
703,20,42,3Ke3,b'8/pppkn1p1/2p5/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P2K3/P7/8 b - -',White doesn't fall for the temptation of 30.Kg3 thinking to win a kingside pawn as that loses to 30...b5 31.Kf3 a5 32.Ke3 Ng6 33.c5 Ke6 etc.
704,20,43,3Ke6,b'8/ppp1n1p1/2p1k3/4Pp2/2P2P2/1P2K3/P7/8 w - -',Black gets his King in the most centralized location available ready to push to d5 whenever the opportunity presents itself. If now 31.Kd4 Black can play ...b6! and then White must mark time while the Black Knight relocates to d7: 32.a3 Ng6 33.Ke3 Nf8 34.Kd4 Nd7 35.Ke3 g5! 36.fxg5 Nxe5 37.Kf4 Ng6+ 38.Kg3 Ke5 and soon Black will win the g-pawn or simply push through on the queenside.
705,20,44,3a4,b'8/ppp1n1p1/2p1k3/4Pp2/P1P2P2/1P2K3/8/8 b - a3',White keeps his King close by f4 but it won't do him much good. Black has too much material to throw at his problems.
706,20,45,3b4,b'8/p1p1n1p1/1pp1k3/4Pp2/PPP2P2/4K3/8/8 b - -',There are few other choices.
707,20,46,3g5,b'8/p1p1n3/1pp1k3/4Ppp1/PPP2P2/4K3/8/8 w - g6',! White has no resources left. 33.fxg5 loses the e-pawn then the g-pawn in due course. No queenside pushes are possible; Black simply has too many pawns there for White to break through. Avoiding capture of the f-pawn is no better anyway as ...Ng6 forces the issue soon enough.
708,20,47,3a5,b'8/p1p1n3/1pp1k3/P3Ppp1/1PP2P2/4K3/8/8 b - -',Hoping for 33...bxa5 34.bxa5 and then maybe Black will blunder and allow the KW in through d5-c5.
709,20,48,3Ng6,b'8/p1p5/1pp1k1n1/P3Ppp1/1PP2P2/4K3/8/8 w - -',White's queenside pawns pose no threat at all. Black can simply force the creation of a passed pawn on the kingside then march to victory on whichever flank the WK doesn't defend.
710,20,49,3Kf3,b'8/p7/1pp3n1/4kpP1/1PP5/5K2/8/8 b - -',White chooses to go kingside hoping to defend his g-pawn and maybe drive the Knight away allowing a promotion if Black missteps.
711,20,50,3a5,b'8/8/1pp3n1/p3kpP1/1PP5/5K2/8/8 w - a6',But now Black will have a passed a-pawn as well and the WK cannot hope to defend both sides of the board.
712,20,51,bxa5,b'8/8/2p3n1/p3kpP1/2P5/5K2/8/8 w - -',0-1. White has no way to stop both the a- and f-pawns and he resigns. Many thanks to luker67 for this excellent game! Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated. If you leave a rating please also comment letting me know what I did well or need to improve! Thanks for reading!
713,21,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
714,21,1,exf5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a less common line looking somewhat like a King's Gambit with the colors reversed. I don't think it generally fares as well as 3.Nxe5.
715,21,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/4p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black kicks the White Knight and aggressively establishes some space on the center. Whether he'll be able to hold it or not is another matter.
716,21,3,Nd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard is 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2 but this is playable as well. 
717,21,4,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/5P2/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Threatening the Knight and developing the Queen to a surprisingly safe effective location. Black intends to make the very most of his half-open f-file.
718,21,5,c3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/5P2/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I can't find any literature for this move. I think 5.Qh5+ is probably stronger (5...g6 6.fxg6 and now if 6...Qxg6 7.Qe5+ wins the Rook so 6...Qxd4 7.g7+ Ke7 and White promotes on move 8 winning material and stymieing the potential Black offensive.
719,21,6,d5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/5q2/3p1P2/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',? This seems logical but I think it's actually too defensive-minded. It's intended to release Black's other Bishop but I think advancing the d-pawn can wait while Black runs the White Knight out of town with 5...c5 6.Nb5 Qc6 7.Qh5+ Kd8. Now Black can play ...d5 and ...c4 at his leisure driving the Knight almost off the board altogether while securing the whole center for himself and preventing White from developing either of his Bishops.
720,21,7,Qh5+,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/5q2/3p1P1Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',White prepares to win a pawn.
721,21,8,g6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp4p/5qp1/3p1P1Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',6...Kd8 is probably better here. The text sacrifices quite a bit of material for open lines--much riskier but certainly in the spirit of the Latvian.
722,21,9,hxg6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp5/5qp1/3p3Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',If 7...Qxg6? 8.Qe5+ wins the Rook and probably the game.
723,21,10,Ne7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/3Q4/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black sacrifices another pawn in exchange for developing with tempo.
724,21,11,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/5b2/3NQ3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',And another (b7) ...
725,21,12,1Nxf5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/5N2/4Q3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Note that White couldn't win the Black Rook immediately with 10.Qxb7 because of ...Qe5+ 11.Be2 Be4. Now however Qxb7 followed by Qxa8 is a threat.
726,21,13,1gxf5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5q2/5p2/4Q3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',?! Black now dumps yet another pawn as well as his queenside Rook. White has nothing developed but his Queen but Black is running out of pieces altogether.
727,21,14,1Qf3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5q2/5p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',White decides his three-pawn lead should be sufficient for now and declines the Rook that Black was offering in favor of keeping his Queen nearby.
728,21,15,1Nbc6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/5p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black's Knight blocks the vulnerable b-pawn and develops toward the center. With this move Black also prepares to castle long getting his King to safety and bringing his other Rook into play. Another good-looking option was 11...Bh6 making White's developmental choices even more nightmarish by pinning his d-pawn.
729,21,16,1Bb5,b'r3kb1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',White prepares his own castle and momentarily pressures the Nc6. I think c4 might have been a stronger place to develop this Bishop in order to prevent a Black Knight from coming to d5 after Black castles.
730,21,17,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',All of Black's pieces are now in the game. His DSB needs a better square and h6 is still tempting (pinning the d-pawn) but Black also wants to leave the h-file open for pressure against White's upcoming castle.
731,21,18,1d4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ d3',White gains some much-needed play for his own QB and QN. He has the makings of a dangerous attack against the Black queenside.
732,21,19,1Nxd4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/5q2/1B3p2/3n4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?! This sacrifice doesn't seem sound at all to me but it slims down White's queenside pawns and gives Black a big lead in space at the cost of half-opening the c-file for a White Rook.
733,21,20,Qxd4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/1B3p2/3q4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Black now has plenty of space and uncontested control of the d-file.
734,21,21,1O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/1B3p2/3q4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',? The WK skedaddles which is pretty reasonable. However this move allows the beautiful and deadly Black Queen to eliminate a critical White piece from the board. Black didn't have any immediate threats; simple queenside development with 15.Nc3 would have been a better choice.
735,21,22,1Qe5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/1B2qp2/8/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',! Black threatens mate on h2 leaving White no time to get his LSB out of danger.
736,21,23,1Bf4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/1B2qp2/5B2/5Q2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',This is a powerful dangerous diagonal for White's QB to occupy. There are a lot of pieces pointed at the BK.
737,21,24,1Na3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/1q3p2/5B2/N4Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Driving the BQ away and offering the pawn on b2-- White's position is very strong after 17...Qxb2 18. Rab1 Qxa2 19.Qxb7+ Kd7 20.Rfd1+ Ke8 21.Rxd8+ Kxd8 22.Qxc7+ Ke8 23.Rb8+ Kf7 24.Nb5. 
738,21,25,1Qb4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/5p2/1q3B2/N4Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black doesn't take the bait instead positioning his Queen where she can support d4 and prevent the White Knight from charging up to b5 or c4.
739,21,26,1Rac1,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/8/5p2/1q3B2/N4Q2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',White completes his development and bears down on c7.
740,21,27,1Nc6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp5/2n5/5p2/1q3B2/N4Q2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',The Knight finally gets off the a3-f8 diagonal and puts itself between White's attack and the BK preparing to jump into action with a much more powerful post on d4.
741,21,28,1Bg5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp5/2n5/5pB1/1q6/N4Q2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',?! I'm not sure about this move. Black's pieces are somewhat disjointed and cannot defend both the Rook and the f-pawn in one move but by pulling his Bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal White relieves some of the pressure on the BK.
742,21,29,1Nd4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp5/8/5pB1/1q1n4/N4Q2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',! Black's Knight leaps to a very strong centralized position defending the f-pawn and gaining time to get the Rook out of the way as well.
743,21,30,2Qe3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp5/8/5pB1/1q1n4/N3Q3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Basically forced. Somewhere to keep pressure on the Black queenside would be preferable but 20.Qg3 and 20.Qf4 both lose immediately to ...Ne2+!
744,21,31,2Rd7,b'2k2b1r/pppr4/8/5pB1/1q1n4/N3Q3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black can now casually lift his Rook out of danger threatening to swing over to the Kingside for a devastating attack.
745,21,32,2Bf6,b'2k2b1r/pppr4/5B2/5p2/1q1n4/N3Q3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',!? White threatens the dangerous Rh8 but this attack is easily-parried and White is starting to lose sight of his formerly-strong attack on the Black King.
746,21,33,2Bg7,b'2k4r/pppr2b1/5B2/5p2/1q1n4/N3Q3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',?! Black eagerly offers a trade for the piece that can best defend White's kingside. If now 22.Bxg7 Rxg7 Black has dangerous-looking attack down his half-open kingside files but the Nd4's position becomes fairly tenuous and White may have a terrific attack through the center.
747,21,34,Nc6,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/2n5/5p2/1q6/N3Q3/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',No attempt to maintain the Knight on d4 is feasible because of 24.Rc4.
748,21,35,2Qd3,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/2n5/5p2/1q6/N2Q4/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',Threatening f5 as well as a mating battery down the d-file should the Black pieces stop defending d7 and d8.
749,21,36,2Qf4,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/2n5/5p2/5q2/N2Q4/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',Black struggles to keep his counterplay alive threatening to clean up some White pawns with tempo or otherwise tempt White into weakening his kingside fortress.
750,21,37,2h3,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/2n5/5p2/5q2/N2Q3P/PP3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',This defends against 25...Qxh2+ 26.Kf1 Qxg2+ but now White needs to keep a careful eye on his weak h3-pawn as it is only defended by the Queen and allowing a Black Rook to open the h-file would be devastating.
751,21,38,2Ne5,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/8/4np2/5q2/N2Q3P/PP3PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',! Black's Knight returns to the center with a multitude of threats. The primary danger is that the threat on the WQ leaves her with very few locations to retreat to from which she can still defend h3. The Queen is also the only defender of f3 where the Knight is looking to deliver a nasty check so 26.Qd2 and Qd4 (thinking to trade off the powerful BQ) are impossible.
752,21,39,2Kf1,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/8/4np2/5q2/N2Q3P/PP3PP1/2RR1K2 b - -',?? Overly concerned about the pin and various checking possibilities for Black White completely forgets about the immediate threat to his Queen. Best was probably 26.Qe3 Nf3+ 27.Kf1 Nh2+ 28.Ke2 Qxe3+ 29.Kxe3 Rxg2 where White will be a pawn down but with decent positional compensation.
753,21,40,2Rxd3,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/8/5p2/5q2/N2R3P/PP3PP1/2R2K2 b - -',? Not that it matters but White certainly can't afford to drop a Rook as well.
754,21,41,2Qxc1+,b'2k4r/ppp3r1/8/5p2/8/N2R3P/PP3PP1/2q2K2 w - -',0-1. White's position is completely hopeless and he resigns.

763,22,8,Nh2,b'rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N4q/PPPPBP1N/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',!! Until this move White had been cramped with no hope of defense or counterplay. Now White's Bishop and Queen are released and spell trouble for Black.
764,22,9,g5,b'rn2k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1n2/2b1p1p1/4P3/2N4q/PPPPBP1N/R1BQ1RK1 w kq g6',Nd7 would be better.

767,22,12,1Ng3,b'rn5r/pppk1p1p/3p4/1Nb1p1p1/6N1/5Bnq/PPPP1P2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',But Black doesn't want to trade -- he wants to give away a Rook and a Pawn.
768,22,13,c6,b'rn1k3r/pB3p1p/2pp1N2/1Nb1p1p1/8/6nq/PPPP1P2/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',! This cuts off the Bishop from the corner and threatens mate.

770,22,15,d5,b'rn5Q/pB1k1p1p/8/1pbp4/4p3/7q/PPPPnP1N/R1B2R1K w - -',?? Further blocking the Bishop but losing the Queen.
771,22,16,Nd7,b'r7/pB1nk2p/3b1p2/1p1p4/4p1Q1/8/PPPP1P1N/R1B2R1K w - -',The rest of the game doesn't need annotation.
772,22,17,3Qe6#,b'8/6R1/3kQ3/pp1B1p1p/8/3PB3/PPP2P1K/R7 b - -',And here it is. An attack on the stronghold proved disastrous. Please leave comments and thanks for reading!
773,23,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',2....d5. The French Defense Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line but I don't think that I like it.
774,23,1,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',3.Qf3? This move is strange. I think that White should develop. 
775,23,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',3....Nc6 Develops keeping tabs on e5 and d4.
776,23,3,Nh3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q1N/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',4.Nh3? White should have probably played 4.Ne2 then fianchettoed his Light Squared Bishop since it has little future in the French center.
777,23,4,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pn1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q1N/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',4....b6 I prepare for a fianchetto. This also allows Bc5 aligning the Bishops.
778,23,5,Ng5,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pn1p3/3p2N1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',5.Ng5. Ahh so that's what he was getting at. No White should develop instead of attacking. Two pieces is hardly a battle-ready force.
779,23,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p2N1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',5...Nf6. This develops and blocks the mate threat on f6.
780,23,7,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p2N1/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',6.c3. Preparing a d4 pawn push which would be follows by d4 e5 and my Dark Squared Bishop would be obsolete. 
781,23,8,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3p2N1/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',6....g6. This allows me to get my Dark Squared Bishop to a more useful location than his dying future on the a3-f8 diagonal.
782,23,9,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3p2N1/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',7.d4. The aforementioned pawn push.
783,23,10,Bh6,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnpb/3p2N1/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',7....Bh6. This pins the Knight to the Bishop on c1.
784,23,11,e5,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnpb/3pP1N1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',8.e5. Now White controls the dark squares. And here is my first miscalculation.
785,23,12,Bxg5,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3pP1b1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',8....Bxg5?? This miscalculation allows Black to win a minor piece.
786,23,13,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3pP1B1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',9....O-O. I cannot move the Knight because of the pin and I had to castle to avoid losing even more material.
787,23,14,Qe8,b'r1b1qrk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pBp1/3pP3/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',10....Qe8. Now everything goes downhill.
788,23,15,1Qh3,b'r1b1qrk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pBp1/3pP3/3P4/2P4Q/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',11.Qh3. This prepares for 12.Qh6 then mate is unavoidable.
789,23,16,1h5,b'r1b1qrk1/p1p2p2/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P4Q/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ h6',11....h5. Only option.
790,23,17,1Qe3,b'r1b1qrk1/p1p2p2/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',12.Qe3. White is relentless. 13.Qh6 is unavoidable mate.
791,23,18,1Kh7,b'r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',12....Kh7. Once again the only defense.
792,23,19,1Be2,b'r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',13.Be2. Probably preparing for a sac on h5 to rip away my defense.
793,23,20,1Na5,b'r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1p2pBp1/n2pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',13....Na5?? This is a huge blunder! I don't know what I was thinking. 13....Ne2 is obviously the correct move here. From e2 the Knight can move to f5 where it controls the h4 h6 g3 g7 e3 e7 and d6 squares. If White trades on e7 that removes a vital attacker from White's attack. 
794,23,21,1Qd3,b'r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1p2pBp1/n2pP2p/3P4/2PQ4/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',14.Qd3. This pins the g6 pawn and allows 15.Bxh5.
795,23,22,Qf8,b'r1b2qr1/p1p2p1k/1p2pBp1/n2pP2B/3P4/2PQ4/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',15...Qf8. Now that I have two defenders in the corner I will try to hang on with everything I have.
796,23,23,Qh6,b'r1b3r1/p1p2p1k/1p2pBpq/n2pP2B/3P4/N1PQ4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',16....Qh6. Kicking the Bishop.
797,23,24,Rxg6,b'r1b5/p1p2p1k/1p2pBrq/n2pP3/3P4/N1PQ4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',17....Rxg6?? The second miscalculation. I should have taken with the Queen or pawn.
798,23,25,1Nb5,b'r1b5/p1p2p1k/1p2pBrq/nN1pP3/3P4/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',18.Nb5. Plans to take on c7 it appears.
799,23,26,2Nd6,b'r1b5/p4p1k/3NpBrq/n1ppP3/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',20.Nd6. Attacking the helpless f-pawn.
800,23,27,2Kg8,b'r1b3k1/p4p2/3NpBrq/n1ppP3/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',20....Kg8. Defending and releasing the pin.
801,23,28,Nb7,b'r1b3k1/pn3p2/3NpBrq/2ppP3/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',21....Nb7. I try to trade Knights. I think that this is better than 21...Bb7. Once the Knight takes the Bishop retakes then I can move the d-pawn and my Bishop will stare down g2.
802,23,29,2Nxc8,b'r1N3k1/pn3p2/4pBrq/2ppP3/8/2PQ4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',22.Nxc8. But White has other plans. 
803,23,30,2Qxa7,b'6k1/Qnr2p2/4pBrq/2ppP3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',24.Qxa7. I thought this was the end of what his Queen would do. How wrong I was.
804,23,31,2Qh3,b'6k1/Qnr2p2/4pBr1/2ppP3/8/2P4q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',24....Qh3. This threatens mate but I overlooked HIS mate threat.
805,23,32,2Qb8+,b'1Q4k1/1nr2p2/4pBr1/2ppP3/8/2P4q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',25.Qb8. I could resign here on account of unavoidable mate but I decided to draw it out as long as possible.
806,23,33,Kh7,b'3Q4/5p1k/4pBr1/2ppP3/8/2P4q/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',27....Kh7. The only move.

My opponent played well in this game and I played terribly. I overlooked miscalculated blundered and overall failed in the middle-late game.

836,24,28,1Nf7+,b'r1bk1r2/pppp1NQp/6p1/2bN4/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',All I need to do is be rid of the Rook on f8. This is achieved by chasing the King away from the Rook. Then again I also have to realize that the Bishop is also something I need to get rid of.
837,24,29,1Ke8,b'r1b1kr2/pppp1NQp/6p1/2bN4/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',18.Nxc7+.

841,24,33,1Kxd6,b'r1b2r2/ppNp2Qp/3k2p1/2b5/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',Black play the expected move.

844,24,36,2Qxc5+,b'r1b5/ppkp3p/6p1/2Q5/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',That is after I take the Bishop.
845,24,37,2O-O-O,b'r1bk4/pp1p3p/6p1/2Q5/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - -',White's position is dangerous.
846,24,38,2b6,b'r1bk4/p2p3p/1p4p1/2Q5/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',Black's going to get nothing done either way.
847,24,39,Rb8,b'1rbk4/p2p3p/1p4p1/3Q4/4P1P1/3P4/PPP2P1P/2KR3R w - -',A simple method now is to eliminate the g6 and h7 pawns.
848,24,40,2h4,b'1rb5/p1kp3Q/1p6/6p1/4P1PP/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR3R b - h3',Making sure that my Rook gets into the Game.
849,24,41,2Rxh4,b'1rb5/p1kp3Q/1p6/8/4P1PR/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 b - -',I don't think that Black is trying in these next moves.
850,24,42,2Kb7,b'1rb5/pk1p3Q/1p6/8/4P1PR/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 w - -',Step 1 of 4: promote the g-pawn.
851,24,43,Ka8,b'krb5/p2p3Q/1p6/6P1/4P2R/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 w - -',What if Black did 28...d6 instead?
852,24,44,2g6,b'krb5/p2p3Q/1p4P1/8/4P2R/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 b - -',It is impossible to stop the Pawn from promoting.
853,24,45,2Bb7,b'kr6/pb1p3Q/1p4P1/8/4P2R/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 w - -',Black's Bishop hops to this square in fear.
854,24,46,3g7,b'kr6/pb1p2PQ/1p6/8/4P2R/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR4 b - -',Finally Black resigns. Here's what the game could possibly look like: 30...Bc6 31.g8=Q Kb7 32.Ra6 Bb5 33.c4 Ka6 34.cxb5+ Kxb5 35.Qxd7+ and a mate in four at the most. Like Steintz explained a premature attack usually loses and this is one of those cases.feel free to editwhat the game could possibly look like because I may be missing better moves. When you have a chance to play a good move play before it's too late. A good move can become a horrible move in one turn if you don't play it.
855,25,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Here's another exciting game in the Latvian Gambit this time the Svedenborg Variation characterized by 3.Bc4 and 4...d5 where White has a stronger-than-usual attack at the very beginning and despite the line being heavily analyzed the position is very sharp and frequently unclear. This game features a king hunt and a very strong attack and showcases what happens in this opening when Black has trouble getting his light-square Bishop into play.
856,25,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and usually more) inviting White to trash the Black kingside in exchange for open files and a potential lead in development.
857,25,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is a particularly aggressive line for White to take. Like most of the other lines in the Latvian besides 3. Nxe5 this move's merit has been heavily disputed (and extensively analyzed).
858,25,3,fxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/2B1p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Kicking the Knight inviting it to e5 for a threat on f7.
859,25,4,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4N3/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White accepts the generous offer threatening a fork on f7. Black doesn't seem to have any compensation for his risky opening as yet.
860,25,5,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',The more common line is 4...Qg5 5. d4 Qxg2 6. Qh5+ g6 7. Bf7+ Kd8 8. Bxg6 Qxh1+ 9. Ke2 Qxc1 10. Nf7+ but I think 4...d5 is stronger for Black.
861,25,6,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/3p3Q/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',6...hxg6 is a playable but less common alternative. 
862,25,7,Qh4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I can't find any literature for this move. More standard is 7. Qe5+ Be7 8. Bb5+ c6 9. Nxe7 Qxe7 10. Qxe7+ Kxe7 11. Be2 and White is a pawn up but will lag considerably in development.
863,25,8,Rg8,b'rnbqkbr1/ppp4p/5nN1/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',Unpinning the h-pawn but more importantly moving the Rook to the half-open g-file. 
864,25,9,Nxf8,b'rnbqkNr1/ppp4p/5n2/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',This is probably the best play here as White gobbles more material before his own pieces begin falling.
865,25,10,Rg4,b'rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n2/3p4/2B1p1rQ/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',?! Black continues to postpone taking White pieces opting for a much more aggressive stance and in fact driving the White Queen forward to a defense of the f8 Knight. 8...Rxg2 is probably reasonable here as well and perhaps better as it leaves g4 open for the Black Knight.
866,25,11,Qh6,b'rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n1Q/3p4/2B1p1r1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq -',White defends f8 but he no longer pins the Black Knight to the Queen allowing ...Rxg2 followed by ...Ng4 threatening a dangerous attack focused at f2.
867,25,12,Rxg2,b'rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n1Q/3p4/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R w KQq -',?! Black is planning 10. Nxh7 Ng4 11. Qf4 Rxf2 12. Qxf2 Nxf2 13. Kxf2 Qh4+ winning back some material and drawing the WK into the open or if White is feeling less cooperative a few variations on a king hunt are possible with White chasing the BK to his queenside but unable to quite finish him off (for example 11. Qg6+ Ke7 12. Qg7+ Kd6 13. Qf8+ Qxf8 14. Nxf8 dxc4 or 14...Bf5 and Black has decent compensation for his material).
868,25,13,1Nc3,b'rnbq4/ppp2Q1N/2k5/3p4/2B1p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights.
869,25,14,1Na6,b'r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/n1k5/3p4/2B1p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',The only way Black is getting out of this is if he gets some more pieces available for combat. With this move Black invites 14. Bb5+ Kd6 15. Qxd5+ Ke7 hoping to get his Bishop into play with tempo as soon as he gets a spare move and then allowing his Queen and Rook to enter the fight and return some pressure against the White King.
870,25,15,1Bxd5+,b'r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/n1k5/3B4/4p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Not quite as strong as 14.Bb5+ I think but certainly still good. White seeks to corner Black's King using his Knight Bishop and a-pawn (eg 14...Kb6 15.a4 Rxf2 16.Qg6+ Ka5 17.b4+ Kxb4 18.Rb1+ Kc5 19.Rb5+ Kd4 20.Qxe4#).

873,25,18,1Ka6,b'r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/k7/P2B4/1n2p1n1/2N5/1PPP1PrP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',This is much safer than 16...Kc5 in my opinion. The BK may have to retreat all the way to b8 but at least he'll be safe there.
874,25,19,1Bxe4,b'r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/k7/P7/1n2B1n1/2N5/1PPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Threatening Qc4+ and mate to follow.
875,25,20,1Rxf2,b'r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/k7/P7/1n2B1n1/2N5/1PPP1r1P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',?? Black badly underestimates White's attacking chances here and pays the price swiftly. Much better for Black was 17...Qd4 shutting the WQ off from c4 and legitimizing his own attack.
876,25,21,1Qxb5#,b'r1bq4/p1p4N/k7/PQ6/1n2B1n1/2N5/1PPP1r1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',1-0. That's all there is! The early development of the White light-square Bishop and Black's inability to get his pieces mobilized (coupled with a few questionable moves) prevented the aggressive counterplay Black so desperately needs in this opening leading to a painful demise for the harried Black King. Many thanks to invinlee85 for the game! Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated and if you leave a low rating please comment to tell me what I can improve! Thanks for reading!
877,26,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This is one of the longest blitz games I've played with both of us getting right down to the wire on our timers. A big pawn block develops in the center and some slow positional play develops with two Bishops facing off against a Bishop and a Knight. I open with the English and the bind I set up on d5 leads to the central pawn structure the last fifty moves of the game revolve around. Thanks for the game finicius!
878,26,1,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My preferred line in the English.

880,26,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/8/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Black's pawn on d6 makes me think he's intending ...e5 or ...c5 which could leave the d-pawn weakened and make it more difficult to advance to give Black's DSB space to maneuver. With that in mind I choose a standard developing move that continues to bear down on d5.
881,26,4,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1pp1n2/8/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is a bit mysterious to me. It seems to indicate ...b5 but that doesn't actually seem to be a serious threat.

I should have played 8.d4 here with the chance to advance to d5 if necessary and preventing ...Nc6 for the time being (8.d4 Nc6 9.d5 wins a piece).
889,26,12,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p1npbn2/2p1p3/2P1P3/1PN3P1/P2PNPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now it is too late for d4.

This was certainly one of the longest (number-of-moves-wise) blitz games I've played on Gameknot and while not exactly clean it was certainly fun to play and interesting to analyze. Thanks again to finicius for this game! Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are much appreciated (and if you leave a low rating please tell me what I can improve!). Thanks for reading; hope you enjoyed it!
935,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I've been playing the controversial Latvian Gambit recently and while it's not the most advisable opening for blitz due to the opening's very sharp nature (it's somewhat more popular in long-form games where Black is less likely to misstep and lose in the first dozen moves or so) it has the advantage of likely getting White off-book very quickly (of course at high levels everyone is prepared for this opening) and Black can find a lot of tricky resources. Inadvisable or no it certainly leads to fun games! This game opens with an uncommon line and features several sacrifices (relatively-sound and otherwise) and a minor-piece checkmate. Enjoy!
936,27,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! This is the key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn in exchange for rapid development and lots of attacking potential.
937,27,2,exf5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The more common line is 3. Nxe5 Qf6. In the text White is unlikely to be able to protect a pawn on f5 and he gives up his claim to the center. By playing this side line that looks more like a reversed King's Gambit White makes me think he's unfamiliar with the opening. Main lines in the King's Gambit don't really apply very well to the Latvian.
938,27,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The standard line here is actually 3...e4 4. Ne5 Nf6 5. Be2 d6 6. Bh5+ Ke7 followed by White retreating his Knight and Black playing ...Bxf5 (note that 7. Nf7 loses material and time after 7...Qe1) but I chose a more conservative approach here given that there's time pressure to consider.
939,27,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',? White defends his wayward pawn on f5 at the cost of blocking the d-pawn and crippling his development. I think it's probably better to let the f-pawn go.
940,27,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Threatening ...e4 forking Knight and Bishop.
941,27,6,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White puts off dealing with ...e4 directly since for now he can counter with Re1.
942,27,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I continue my development. White's already gotten away into his castle so I need to step it up.
943,27,8,b3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This is the easiest way to let the DSB out at this point but it's not destined to get much action pointed straight at a well-defended e5 pawn.
944,27,9,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pppb2pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',White's just told me with his last move that his Bishop isn't leaving d3 anytime soon so I might as well develop my own LSB.
945,27,10,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Threatening ...e4.
946,27,11,Nc3,b'r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Defending e4.
947,27,12,d5,b'r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2n2n2/3ppP2/8/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?! This wasn't particularly well thought-out. I probably should have played 7...d5 to allow more options for my DSB. This does renew the threat of ...e4 though which wouldn't actually be possible if the White Rook could still pin it to the BK.
948,27,13,Be2,b'r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2n2n2/3ppP2/8/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White chooses to pull his Bishop back to give himself some more space on d3.
949,27,14,Bxf5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I finally get the f5 pawn back. Now I'm in a position I'm not used to--normally this opening leaves me significantly behind in material trying to make the most of my advanced development. Here I still have a slight spatial edge but materially we are even.
950,27,15,1d3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I don't think this move accomplishes much right now. If White were planning to play c4 he should get the Knight out of the way first and since the only decent place to put that Knight at the moment is b5 I don't see a reason to deny it the Bishop's support prematurely. This move adds a little defense to e4 but otherwise I don't see any reason for it.
951,27,16,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',In retrospect I wish I had castled queenside. White isn't at all set up for a pawn storm on that flank and this position ends up leaving me a bit more exposed than I would like.
952,27,17,1Re1,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',White gets his Rook onto the critical e-file but as yet it can exert no influence with the stymied Bishop blocking its path.
953,27,18,1e4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3p1b2/4p3/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',!? At this point I feel like I'm ahead enough in development and open space that I can break the position open and begin an attack. This move frees White's Bishop but I'm feeling like my King is reasonably safe.
954,27,19,1Qxd8,b'r2Q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/5b2/4p3/1PN2N2/PBP1BPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White sees an attack coming so he immediately begins trading down.
955,27,20,1Raxd8,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/5b2/4p3/1PN2N2/PBP1BPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',My development is now complete and my Rooks both occupy powerful open/half-open files.
956,27,21,1Ng5,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/5bN1/4p3/1PN5/PBP1BPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White's Bishop now has plenty of opportunities for play allowing it to open up an attack by the Rook to win e4.
957,27,22,1h6,b'3r1rk1/ppp1b1p1/2n2n1p/5bN1/4p3/1PN5/PBP1BPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',?! I want to eliminate White's most active piece but it will cost me the exchange. I haven't looked ahead very much so I'm basically just betting that I can get compensation for the Rook.
958,27,23,Kh8,b'3r1r1k/ppp1b1p1/2n2n1p/5bN1/2B1p3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Forced.

960,27,25,Rxd8,b'3r4/ppp1b1pk/2n2n1p/5b2/2B1p3/1PN5/PBP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I'm down the exchange but my pieces are a little more active. I'll have to make very good use of my mobility to force White to make more threats than White can respond to.
961,27,26,1f3,b'3r4/ppp1b1pk/2n2n1p/5b2/2B1p3/1PN2P2/PBP3PP/R3R1K1 b - -',? White wants to take down my isolated e-pawn but he could do it with pieces. This move weakens his kingside defenses needlessly and gives me an obvious way to press the attack.
962,27,27,exf3,b'3r4/ppp3pk/2n2n1p/2b2b2/2B5/1PN2p2/PBP3PP/R3R2K w - -',19...e3 is probably also playable here but I just didn't see myself getting the pawn all the way through with so much material on the board.
963,27,28,Nd4,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/2Bn4/1PN2P2/PBP4P/R3R2K w - -',Forking the f and c pawns (I'd prefer to take c2 with the Knight over the Bishop since that would equalize the material) and bringing this Knight up closer to the real action.
964,27,29,2Rac1,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/2Bn4/1PN2P2/PBP4P/2R1R2K b - -',This is the only decent move for this Rook as at b1 or d1 I just play 21...Bxc2 and the Rook has to move again anyway.
965,27,30,2Nxf3,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/2B5/1PN2n2/PBP4P/2R1R2K w - -',Threatening the White Rook while opening the path to his King. My Bishops are so much more active than White's are and it's starting to show.
966,27,31,2Ref1,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/2B5/1PN2n2/PBP4P/2R2R1K b - -',Skewering the Knight and LSB. It's worth noting that White's Knight (and therefore also his DSB) are completely locked down by the threat of ...Be4.
967,27,32,2Nh4,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/2B4n/1PN5/PBP4P/2R2R1K w - -',I respond to White's threat and neatly trap the White King.
968,27,33,2Bd3,b'3r4/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/7n/1PNB4/PBP4P/2R2R1K b - -',White cannot let my Bishop off the b1-h7 diagonal or I will be able to move ...Bh3 and White's position becomes very dire. This move by White wins the offending Bishop anyway eliminating my pair and with it my best shot at equalization or victory...
969,27,34,2Rxd3,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/7n/1PNr4/PBP4P/2R2R1K w - -',...Unless of course I throw my Rook at the problem. Now all of White's pieces will be locked into a valiant defense of their beleaguered King.
970,27,35,Bxd3,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b5/7n/1PNb4/PB5P/2R2R1K w - -',In the game I briefly considered 24...Bh3 (threatening ...Bg2#) and discarded the idea because White has too many defenders for g2. The continuation looks like 24...Bh3 25. Rg1 Ng4 (threatening mate on f2) 26. Rc2 and Black can win back both Rooks but I don't see a clear mate and White is suddenly free to act on the queenside.
971,27,36,2Rfe1,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b5/7n/1PNb4/PB5P/2R1R2K b - -',White intends to keep his Rook alive as long as possible while adding some muscle to the e4 mating square.
972,27,37,2Bf5,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b2b2/7n/1PN5/PB5P/2R1R2K w - -',Threatening ...Bg4 and ...Bf3#.
973,27,38,2Re5,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/2b1Rb2/7n/1PN5/PB5P/2R4K b - -',This Rook is about the only piece White can move freely so he goes after my undefended DSB.
974,27,39,2Bd4,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/4Rb2/3b3n/1PN5/PB5P/2R4K w - -',I can't quite force the mate after 26...Bh3 27. Rxc5 Ng4 28. Rc2 so I pin White's Knight to avoid letting it into the action (since it's otherwise free now that a Rook is covering e4).
975,27,40,2Re2,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/5b2/3b3n/1PN5/PB2R2P/2R4K b - -',?? With this seemingly-reasonable move White thinks to defend e4 g2 and b2 in one fell swoop but it loses him a huge exchange at the very least. Better was to give back the material with 27. Rxf5 Nxf5 28. Ba3.
976,27,41,2Bg4,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/8/3b2bn/1PN5/PB2R2P/2R4K w - -',! The only way to stop mate at f3 now is 28. Rf1 Bxe2 29. Nxe2 Bxb2 and Black is two pawns a Knight and a Bishop above White's Rook with an easy win in sight. If White doesn't take the Bishop on move 29 and instead plays anything else Black plays 29...Bf3+ 30. Rxf3 Nxf3 and wins handily.
977,27,42,2Ne4,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/8/3bN1bn/1P6/PB2R2P/2R4K b - -',Simply put this move doesn't stop the mate threat. Perhaps White thinks to distract me with check on f6 and the discovered attack on my Bishop but none of that matters.
978,27,43,Bxg2#,b'8/ppp3pk/5n1p/8/3bN2n/1P6/PB4bP/2R4K w - -',That's that! The difference in power all game long between Black's active Bishops and White's passive ones is astonishing. This game was great fun to play so many thanks to krishnas83 for that. Comments on the analysis or on the game itself are greatly appreciated (and if you leave a poor rating please comment to tell me what I can improve!). Thanks for reading!

Then 10.Nxh8 winning the rook so I played this move because I thought that it would prevent the fork.  However I overlooked his LSB so he could have played 9.Nf7.  Consequently 9...Kxf7 would be illegal due to his bishop.  At this point I know that I am loosing because my king is completely exposed and there is nothing that I can do about it as I cannot castle.  As a result he will continue to check me with Bf7+ followed by Be6+.  In the meantime I will keep playing ...Kd7 followed by ...Kd8 because I spot an advantage.  What is the advantage?  If this continues I will be able to trick him into a 3-fold repetition.  BTW this trick was planned when 8.Bxf7+ was played.  On the other hand I did not think that he was going to allow this until he played 11.Bf7+.  That is because I have tried to trick Jack Stockel into a 3 fold repetition when: I was loosing he was trying to mate me and he was continuing to place me in check.

For that reason I was in a loosing position and had almost lost but I was also able to trick him into a 3 fold repetition.  After this game was finished I learned something from easy19.  What was it?  Fred told me that he has played this variation many times and almost always wins with this queen sac so I was lucky that he was not paying attention to this attempted trick.  On a normal basis he would have captured the knight with 9.Bxg4 instead of playing 9.Bf7+.  If he took my knight or rook the game would have been lost.  "

Qd4 was stronger move attacking the queen on e3 the pawn on a7 and d6. its not good for black 18....Qxd4.19.Bxa6+Kb8.19.Rxd4.or 18....Qe6.19. Qxa7 with big advantage  after 19....Re81!.20.Qxe3-Rxe3.21.Rxd6 white stays with pawn advantage and good position .
993,29,6,1Rxc6+,b'2krr3/p2n1pQp/b1R3p1/8/5P2/2N1q3/PPP1B1PP/4KR2 b - -',Big mistake for white it seems that black just lost abishop on a3 but the weak king on the center can pay abig price .
994,29,7,1Kb7,b'3rr3/pk1n1pQp/b1R3p1/8/5P2/2N1q3/PPP1B1PP/4KR2 w - -',now black is mistake the correct move was 19.....Kb8!! that  gives black  awinnig position after 20. Rxa6-Nc5.21.Ra3-Rd2 . 
995,29,8,2Ra3,b'3rr3/pk3pQp/6p1/2n5/5P2/R1N1q3/PPP1B1PP/4KR2 b - -',and ad raw was agreed because of 22.....Qc1-e3+ . another option was 22. Qxf7+Rd7.23.Qc4-Nxa6.Qxa6+ = that's why 19.....Kb8 was better move .  I hope you liked  my game  Evan i played bad and all most  have been punished for  being greedy for material  i learned allot like how much castling and safety of the king is so much important  thank you and i would like to read yours comments have nice day and play chess !!!
996,30,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The English opening.
997,30,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black chooses a reversed-Sicilian which suits me fine and frequently (in my experience) leads to very sharp play--perfect for blitz chess.
998,30,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My preferred continuation. 2. Nc3 is perfectly playable here as well.
999,30,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move has the potential to transition many different ways. Most importantly to me it indicates that Black plans to seriously contest control of d5.
1000,30,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Other popular moves here are 3. b3 3. d4 3. Nf3 and 3. Bg2. I chose the text move to show a confrontational stance--I'm not giving Black d5 without a fight.
1001,30,5,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/1pp5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Planning to fianchetto the Bishop to compete with me along the a8-h1 diagonal. I haven't seen any theory supporting this move but I don't necessarily dislike it.
1002,30,6,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pb1p1ppp/1pp5/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',We both continue our development and I begin to prepare for an eventual d4.
1003,30,7,d6,b'rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1ppp4/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is about the only way to shore up e5 so Black's ...d5 push will have to wait.
1004,30,8,b3,b'rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1ppp4/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I feel like e5 is weak so I get ready to pressure it and support my coming advance to d4.
1005,30,9,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pb3ppp/1ppp1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black needs to catch up in development so this is logical. 6...Nd7 would be fine as well I think.
1006,30,10,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1ppp1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/PB1PPPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Preparing to castle. This is the best spot for that Bishop at the moment since Black's d-pawn can't get out of the way just yet.
1007,30,11,d4,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1ppp1n2/4p3/2PP4/1PN2NP1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq d3',I have a slight edge in development and initiative so I want to break the position open before he can catch up.
1008,30,12,e4,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1ppp1n2/8/2PPp3/1PN2NP1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',This is a solid move as ...d5 is coming and that advanced pawn will be well defended.
1009,30,13,Ng5,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1ppp1n2/6N1/2PPp3/1PN3P1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Threatening e4 mostly as a formality.
1010,30,14,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1pp2n2/3p2N1/2PPp3/1PN3P1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',White cannot remove this defender efficiently.
1011,30,15,1f3,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1pp2n2/3p2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I attack the pawn chain head-on planning 10...exf3 11. exf3 followed by O-O and f4.
1012,30,16,1c5,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p3n2/2pp2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',! Lending the Bishop's support to e4 and increasing the tension in the center. He wants to complicate the situation so I'll make a misstep--the same general idea that I favor in blitz games. Things are about to get really hairy; one wrong move on either side could spell disaster.
1013,30,17,1O-O,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p3n2/2pp2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Given the complicated nature of the position I feel it's wise to get my King out of the way. I'm also starting to think about sacrificing my Knight on f7 if Black doesn't castle soon in order to attract the Black King into the path of my Rook.
1014,30,18,1h6,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bpp1/1p3n1p/2pp2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black tries to kick my Knight back to a dismal post at h3 giving him a clear advantage in the center and the initiative.
1015,30,19,1Nxf7,b'rn1qk2r/pb2bNp1/1p3n1p/2pp4/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I think I can get compensation for the Knight. I have a slight developmental advantage and 12...Kxf7 13. fxe4 dxe4 14. Nxe4 Rf8 15. d5 Kg8 looks promising.
1016,30,20,1Kxf7,b'rn1q3r/pb2bkp1/1p3n1p/2pp4/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Pretty much forced.

1019,30,23,1exd5,b'rn1q3r/pb2b1p1/1p3nkp/2pP4/2PP4/1PN3P1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I decide to stuff Black's dangerous LSB while claiming a third pawn in exchange for my Knight and opening up the b1-h7 diagonal for my Queen and/or Bishop.
1020,30,24,1Rf8,b'rn1q1r2/pb2b1p1/1p3nkp/2pP4/2PP4/1PN3P1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? This feels out-of-place and Black can't afford the tempo. He needed to play 14...Kh7 here because now he's about to lose his chance.
1021,30,25,1Qd3+,b'rn1q1r2/pb2b1p1/1p3nkp/2pP4/2PP4/1PNQ2P1/PB2P1BP/R4RK1 b - -',I force Black's King back into the pin and free my a1 Rook.
1022,30,26,1Kf7,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkp1/1p3n1p/2pP4/2PP4/1PNQ2P1/PB2P1BP/R4RK1 w - -',Black pulls back (not that he had much choice) and is now only a move away from relative safety on g8. 
1023,30,27,1Qh7,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkpQ/1p3n1p/2pP4/2PP4/1PN3P1/PB2P1BP/R4RK1 b - -',I want to keep Black tangled and keep the pressure on; the loss of my d-pawn is worth keeping the King out of his safehouse.
1024,30,28,1cxd4,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2Pp4/1PN3P1/PB2P1BP/R4RK1 w - -',Black accepts the proffered pawn threatening to open a line for the dark Bishop to the White King. 
1025,30,29,1e4,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2PpP3/1PN3P1/PB4BP/R4RK1 b - e3',! After 17...dxc3 18. Bxc3 the Black King must retreat to e8 (allowing Qxg7 and a strong position) to avoid my pawn advancing to e5 and winning a piece.
1026,30,30,1dxe3e.p.,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P5/1PN1p1P1/PB4BP/R4RK1 w - -',Black sees it and decides to deny me the powerful center pawns. Now he threatens ...Bc4 and ...e2.
1027,30,31,1Ne4,b'rn1q1r2/pb2bkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2p1P1/PB4BP/R4RK1 b - -',Black can't play 18...e2 to any effect right now so I centralize my Knight and unchain my Bishop bringing up more pieces to renew my attack.
1028,30,32,1Nbd7,b'r2q1r2/pb1nbkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2p1P1/PB4BP/R4RK1 w - -',Black needs reinforcements as well and extra support for the f6 Knight doesn't hurt.
1029,30,33,1Rae1,b'r2q1r2/pb1nbkpQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2p1P1/PB4BP/4RRK1 b - -',At this point I have a feeling Black is about ready to give up on g8 and bring his King back to e8 freeing his Knight against my Queen. There are a lot of pieces between e1 and e8 but only the Bishop defends d6 and e8 seems awfully cramped. Thus this move. 
1030,30,34,1Ke8,b'r2qkr2/pb1nb1pQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2p1P1/PB4BP/4RRK1 w - -',? And there it is. Black needed to get his King someplace a little safer though looking back I actually think this move is Black's biggest misstep for reasons that will become clear soon. For now the White Queen is in danger again and White has a few options to deal with it. Without looking ahead what would you play?
1031,30,35,2Rxe3,b'r2qkr2/pb1nb1pQ/1p3n1p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2R1P1/PB4BP/5RK1 b - -',20. Qxg7 or 20. Qg6+ are strong as well but frankly I think this is the flashiest way to go about protecting my wayward Queen (and pressing the assault and setting a trap--remember this is blitz!).
1032,30,36,2Nxh7,b'r2qkr2/pb1nb1pn/1p5p/3P4/2P1N3/1P2R1P1/PB4BP/5RK1 w - -',Black under time pressure and grasping for useful moves doesn't see the danger! He has very few better choices here as his position is to put it mildly cramped and the huge number of variations to follow is a serious concern with only a few minutes left on the clock. The BK can escape with his life after 20...Qc7 after which Black may be able to trade down to a livable (but difficult) endgame. 20...Nxe4 loses to 21. Qg6+ Rf7 22. Qxf7# and 20...Nc5 looks promising at first but the situation becomes hopeless after 21. Nd6+ Kd7 22. Qf5+ Kc7 (22...Kxd6 Be5#) 23. Nb5+ Kb8 24. Be5+ Bd6 25. Bxd6+ Qxd6 26. Nxd6.
1033,30,37,2Nd6#,b'r2qkr2/pb1nb1pn/1p1N3p/3P4/2P5/1P2R1P1/PB4BP/5RK1 b - -',And there you have it a couple sacrifices resulting in a neat little Knight mate on the BK's home square. This game was great fun to play; I hope you enjoyed it. Comments on the game/annotation are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!
1034,31,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A simple Philidor nothing much to see here.
1035,31,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/3Pp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White would rather pressure Black's position than go for the bloodbath in the center of the board.
1036,31,2,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White is amassing the forces while Black is content to dig in and get ready to attack later.
1037,31,3,Bd7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1bn1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black is packing his pieces in.  It looks rather cramped.  Something will happen soon though as White will not get through Black's defense without blasting through Black's center.
1038,31,4,exd5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/3Pp3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',We have traded bishop and pawn; Black's center formation looks relatively secure but more development for both sides would be nice.

1040,31,6,1Bg5,b'rn1qk2r/pp4pp/3p1b2/3PpnB1/8/2N2N2/PPP2P1P/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',A bad attack.  White is trying to pin the bishop but evidently has forgotten that the bishop can attack.  A lost piece.
1041,31,7,1Kh1,b'rn2k2r/pp4pp/3p4/3Ppnq1/8/2N5/PPP2P1P/R2Q1R1K b kq -',Black now has the upper hand - the king in the corner and unable to move - and who is attacking now?  The tables have turned.
1042,31,8,1Rg1,b'rn2k2r/pp4pp/3p4/3Pp1q1/7n/2N5/PPP2P1P/R2Q2RK b kq -',A cheap checkmate attempt which White sees through easily enough.
1043,31,9,Nd7,b'r4rk1/pp1n2pp/3p1q2/3Pp3/7n/2NQ4/PPP2P1P/5RRK w - -',The kingside is heating up.  Black apparently falling back into defense again.
1044,31,10,2f4,b'r4rk1/pp1n2pp/3p1q2/3Pp3/5P1n/2NQ4/PPP4P/5RRK b - f3',An opening salvo to open a few things up.
1045,31,11,Ng6,b'r4rk1/pp1n2pp/3p1qn1/3P4/5pR1/2NQ4/PPP4P/5R1K w - -',Black eschews the 21...g5 opportunity which would be aggressive defense but would possibly leave the king open to more attack.
1046,31,12,2Qh3,b'r4rk1/pp1n2pp/3p1qn1/3P4/5pR1/2N4Q/PPP4P/5R1K b - -',A curious move - Ne2 might have been better.
1047,31,13,2Ne4,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/3p1qn1/3Pn3/4NpR1/7Q/PPP4P/5R1K b - -',Attacks for both sides White's looking more dangerous despite being a bishop and pawn down.
1048,31,14,h6,b'r4rk1/pp3qp1/3p2np/3Pn1N1/5pR1/7Q/PPP4P/5R1K w - -',A bad mistake for Black.  A lost queen certainly not to put Black out of the game but it won't make things easy.
1049,31,15,Nxg6,b'r5k1/pp3rp1/3p2np/3P4/5p2/7Q/PPP4P/5R1K w - -',A mistake by White to put Black back in the game.  I see Black as slightly ahead.
1050,31,16,Nh7,b'r5k1/pp3rpn/3Q3p/3P4/5p2/8/PPP4P/5R1K w - -',Black doesn't have a whole lot of moves yet his king looks reasonably secure.  He will need help to get out of this one though.
1051,31,17,3Qe5,b'5rk1/pp3rp1/7p/3PQ1n1/5R2/8/PPP4P/7K b - -',Black has turned the tables.  White has a free rook.
1052,31,18,3d6,b'5rk1/pp4p1/3P3p/4Q1n1/5r2/8/PPP4P/7K b - -',White may as well tie up one of Black's rooks and threaten a promotion.
1053,31,19,Rxc2,b'6k1/pp4p1/3P3p/4Q1n1/8/6K1/PPr4P/5r2 w - -',Might as well gobble up a pawn while we're down there.
1054,31,20,Rf8,b'5rk1/pp1P2p1/7p/4Q1n1/8/4K3/PP5P/6r1 w - -',The forced movement of the king is no longer viable and the pawn has to be dealt with.
1055,31,21,Nf7,b'5rk1/pp1P1np1/7p/3Q4/8/4K3/PP5P/6r1 w - -',A counter to the queen's defense of the promotion square.
1056,31,22,4Qc4,b'5rk1/pp1P1np1/7p/6r1/2Q5/8/PP3K1P/8 b - -',White must give up on the pawn.
1057,31,23,Rc7,b'3r2k1/pprP1np1/7p/8/1P6/3Q4/P4K1P/8 w - -',The pawn to be taken finally.
1058,31,24,Rcxd7,b'3r2k1/pp1r1np1/7p/8/PP6/3Q4/5K1P/8 w - -',White trying to put some pressure on Black's remaining pawns but Black is forcing the queen to move. This will be over before long.
1059,31,25,Ne5+,b'5rk1/p2r2p1/1pQ4p/1P2n3/P7/8/5K1P/8 w - -',This could have been done a move before but it does the same thing. White resigned here his mistakes having been worse than Black's.
1060,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',First amazing move: d4 instead of usual e4!!
1061,32,1,Bd5,b'rn1qk2r/p4ppp/4pn2/1p1bN3/2pP4/1PB1P3/5PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',From Black 7th move I thought that he mustn't defense this Pawn!
1062,32,2,Bxg2,b'rn1qk2r/p4ppp/4pn2/4N3/2BP4/2B1P3/5PbP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I think my attack will be strong enough!
1063,32,3,Bg6,b'rn1qk2r/p4pRp/4pnb1/4N3/2BP4/2B1P3/5P1P/R2QK3 w Qkq -',Black try to trap my Rook!
1064,32,4,1Bb4,b'rn1qk2r/p4pRp/4pnb1/4N3/1BBP4/4P3/5P1P/R2QK3 b Qkq -',An important move: Black King cant scape to King side!
1065,32,5,1Qf3,b'rnq1k2r/p2n1bRp/4p3/1B6/1B1P4/4PQ2/5P1P/R3K3 b Qkq -',I never think of taking the Black Rook on a8!!
1066,32,6,2Qf6,b'rnq1k2r/p2n2Rp/4pQb1/1B6/1B1P4/4P3/5P1P/R3K3 b Qkq -',Without hope!
1067,33,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Van't Kruijs. Not a popular opening at high levels but notable for its transpositional potential and used famously on multiple occasions by Kasparov against the Fritz engine.
1068,33,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',More popular are 1...e5 or 1...d5 but I was hoping for 2.c4 b6 and a reversed Nimzovitch-Larsen attack.
1069,33,2,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',With this second unusual move we stray further from the book and the usual transpositions. I think 2.b3 2.c4 or 2.Nf3 are stronger and more straightforward.
1070,33,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I was already planning to fianchetto this bishop; it's an even more obvious choice now with b4 in White's control.
1071,33,4,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/1P6/P3P3/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',Again I think 2.b3 is cleaner. This is certainly more aggressive but I've already made it clear that I don't intend to seriously contest the b4 square right away. As of this move we are entirely off-book (with one game in Gameknot's World database following this line for another couple of moves).
1072,33,5,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P6/P3P3/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.
1073,33,6,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPP1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Continuing to develop the queenside aggressively. I think 5.Nf3 or 5.c4 might be more in line with the attack White is preparing here; he could benefit from the assistance of the c-pawn.

1075,33,8,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq d3',Mildly restricting ...c5 for now though I felt at the time like this weakened White's queenside unnecessarily. I'm going to get c5 eventually; I think a simple developing move might have been stronger for White.
1076,33,9,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',I take a moment to collect myself in case all those pawns start pouring down the board. I'm also getting my King out of the way for when the position inevitably opens up.
1077,33,10,Nf3,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/1BP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',White starts mobilizing his kingside.

1079,33,12,Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3ppnp1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I'm not sure of the purpose behind this move. White may be aiming for a Knight on e4 or c4 but either post is easily assailable and exchanging one of his knights for my expendable one on f6 doesn't seem productive.
1080,33,13,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3ppnp1/2p5/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ c6',With the White Queen momentarily out of the picture this is a good time to get off my back three ranks.
1081,33,14,dxc5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3ppnp1/2P5/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',The computer labels this an inaccuracy and gives the continuation 9...Nd5 10. Ndb1 dxc5 11. b5 a6 12. Ra2 Nc7 13. bxa6 Nxa6 which certainly looks good for Black with a significant developmental lead and good prospects against White's cramped position. The computer recommends 9.Be2 instead...

1084,33,17,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2pnp1/1Pp5/8/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The computer is still obsessed with ...Nd5 but I'm not feeling that aggressive at this point in the game. I'm trying to clamp down on White's advanced position and get my Bishop into the action but...
1085,33,18,1Qf3,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2pnp1/1Pp5/8/P1N1PQ2/1BPN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',...There goes my Bishop's only good square and it's going to take some work to get him into play. This move also puts some pressure on my Knight on f6 threatening to open up a powerful discovered attack down the long diagonal.
1086,33,19,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2p1p1/1Ppn4/8/P1N1PQ2/1BPN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Blocking the attack down the h1-a8 diagonal and preparing for ...Bb7. I open up my own pin first to keep White's Knight from trying anything tricky.
1087,33,20,1Nde4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2p1p1/1Ppn4/4N3/P1N1PQ2/1BP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',The computer lists this as an inaccuracy and I agree. While it doesn't lose material this Knight push nets me a tempo after ...f5 which I can then use to play ...Bb7. I think the intention was to aim at d6 while defending the Knight on c3 but that piece is in no real danger (12.O-O-O Bxc3 13.Bxc3 Nxc3 14.Qxa8 Nxd1 15.Kxd1 leaves White in fine position).
1088,33,21,1f5,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2bp/1p2p1p1/1Ppn1p2/4N3/P1N1PQ2/1BP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ f6',Picking up a little space and gaining a tempo to play ...Bb7 after the Knight retreats.

1090,33,23,Bg7,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2bp/1p2p1p1/1PpN1p2/4N3/P3PQ2/R1P2PPP/4KB1R w K -',I really wanted to keep my Bishop around and I was afraid of hanging my Rook if I got greedy and started taking more Knights right away. 14...exd5 is definitely better here.
1091,33,24,1Nf4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2bp/1p2p1p1/1Pp2p2/4NN2/P3PQ2/R1P2PPP/4KB1R b K -',?? This is not the correct Knight to give me. White would get the pawn back anyway but at least after 15.Nd2 Ne5 (not 15...exd4? 16.Qxd4+ Kh8 17.Qxa8) 16.Ne7+ Qxe7 17.Qxa8 Qc7 18.f4 Bd7 19.Qxf8+ Kxf8 20.fxe5 Qxe5 White has decent if maybe not enough compensation.
1092,33,25,1fxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2bp/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/4pN2/P3PQ2/R1P2PPP/4KB1R w K -',The material is nice but now I have to keep an eye on my isolated undefended e6 pawn.
1093,33,26,1Qxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n2bp/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/4QN2/P3P3/R1P2PPP/4KB1R b K -',The critical difference between this move and the line mentioned above: White takes back without check. But now he threatens e6 and my Rook at a8 so how am I to defend both?
1094,33,27,1Bc3+,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n3p/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/4QN2/P1b1P3/R1P2PPP/4KB1R w K -',! Driving the King into the open.

1096,33,29,1Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp1n3/4QN2/P1b1P3/R1P1KPPP/5B1R w - -',This Knight finally gets into the fight unleashing the Black Queen and defending the weak e6 pawn in the process. I've dealt with both of the White Queen's threats for now.
1097,33,30,1Nd3,b'r1bq1rk1/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp1n3/4Q3/P1bNP3/R1P1KPPP/5B1R b - -',The only move. If 18.Qxa8?? 18...Qd2#.

My thought process here was that after 18...Bb7 19.Qxb7 Ng4 20.Kd1 Nxf2 and I get the rook then the bishop and win easily. What I failed to notice is that the Knight doesn't actually check White's King from g4 so the King has no reason to move and my poor patient Bishop dies for no good reason. 18...c4 would have been a much better choice.
1099,33,32,Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/pQ5p/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/6n1/P1bNP3/R1P1KPPP/5B1R w - -',Steadfastly sticking to my plan even though I realize at this point that I've given back a large portion of my advantage. I still threaten f2 and White's development is too far behind to defend it efficiently.
1100,33,33,2f3,b'r2q1rk1/pQ5p/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/6n1/P1bNPP2/R1P1K1PP/5B1R b - -',Better than letting me take f2 with check.

White's King can't take my Knight here without exposing himself to a deadly attack from my Queen Bishop and Rook.
1102,33,35,2Qe4,b'r2q1rk1/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp5/4Q3/P1bNnP2/R1P1K1PP/5B1R b - -',Black brings the Queen back to someplace useful and threatens to take the Knight and get his other pieces off the back rank.
1103,33,36,2Kf2,b'r2q1rk1/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp2n2/4Q3/P1bN1P2/R1P2KPP/5B1R b - -',Trying to get out of the way of the light-square Bishop so White can get his last two pieces into play. Getting the King off the e file also threatens Qxe6+ without having to worry about a game-ending pin.
1104,33,37,2Kh8,b'r2q1r1k/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp2n2/4Q3/P1bN1P2/R1P2KPP/5B1R w - -',Getting out of the way of Qxe6+ and inviting White to take the pawn confident that giving my rook the e file would be well worth the material.
1105,33,38,2Be2,b'r2q1r1k/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp2n2/4Q3/P1bN1P2/R1P1BKPP/7R b - -',White continues to work to consolidate his position not taking the bait on e6. 
1106,33,39,2Bd4+,b'r2q1r1k/p6p/1p2p1p1/1Pp2n2/3bQ3/P2N1P2/R1P1BKPP/7R w - -',So I continue to do my best to keep the Rook from escaping its corner. The King has to retreat and the Rook stays out of play for at least another two turns.
1107,33,40,Qd6,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp2n2/3bQ3/P2N1P2/R1P1B1PP/4K2R w - -',I'm comfortable enough with White's awkward position that I can spare the tempo to defend the e-pawn. With this move I transition from my earlier defensive posture into all-out prophylaxis mode; my goal now is to slowly tighten the noose until White is forced to give up something decisive. The computer suggests Nd6 instead which opens up the position a bit and is certainly playable.
1108,33,41,2c4,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp2n2/2PbQ3/P2N1P2/R3B1PP/4K2R b - c3',?! Freeing the Rook and reinforcing the queenside momentarily but hanging a pawn in the process. I like 25.g3 or 25.f4 here instead with an eye toward hiking the King over to c1 or b1 and freeing the h-Rook.
1109,33,42,2Ne3,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp5/2PbQ3/P2NnP2/R3B1PP/4K2R w - -',The Knight returns to this menacing outpost forking g2 and c4. My Knight and Bishop are unassailable right now and White would dearly love to be rid of them.
1110,33,43,2g4,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp5/2PbQ1P1/P2NnP2/R3B2P/4K2R b - g3',I think 26.g3 is better here. There's no reason to overadvance the g-pawn; it makes f3 and f4 unnecessarily weak and doesn't accomplish anything that 26.g3 wouldn't. There are a few other options that provide a bit of counterplay for White but I can't see anything better than g3.
1111,33,44,2Nxc4,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp5/2nbQ1P1/P2N1P2/R3B2P/4K2R w - -',Picking up the free pawn. I considered leaving the Knight on e3 because it's just so strong there or trying 26...Ng2+ and trying to drive the White King into a nasty discovered check or fork but this seemed the most straightforward and doesn't let White's Rook on h1 out.
1112,33,45,2Nc1,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp5/2nbQ1P1/P4P2/R3B2P/2N1K2R b - -',Threatening the Knight and pinning the Bishop momentarily. White's Knight is now in an ugly spot but at least the Rook on a2 has a path out.

1114,33,47,2Kf2,b'r4r1k/p6p/1p1qp1p1/1Pp5/2n1Q1P1/P1b2P2/R3BK1P/2N4R b - -',Forced but at least it lets the h1 Rook out at last.

1120,33,53,3Qxe6,b'3r3k/p6p/1p1qQ1p1/1P6/2B2rP1/PNb2P2/Rn4KP/7R b - -',? Not as strong as the line I gave in 30...c4. This move eliminates my position's biggest weakness (the pawn at e6 that's been hounding me all game) wins me the Bishop and trades off White's most powerful piece.
1121,33,54,3Rxc4,b'3r3k/p6p/1p1qQ1p1/1P6/2r3P1/PNb2P2/Rn4KP/7R w - -',?! The computer lists this as a mistake preferring to take with the Knight. I wanted to keep White's Rook and Knight locked away but now my interlocked R/N/B trio is going to make my life difficult. 32...Nxc4 would maybe have been easier.
1122,33,55,3Rc1,b'7k/p6p/1p1r2p1/1P6/2r3P1/PNb2P2/Rn4KP/2R5 b - -',Setting up an obnoxious pin on the Bishop threatening Rxb2 or Rxc3.

1124,33,57,3Rcc2,b'7k/p6p/1p1r2p1/1P6/2r3P1/PNbn1P2/R1R3KP/8 b - -',? Not the exchange line I was hoping for but this is a subtle mistake White couldn't afford to make.

This game was part of the Sicilian Pelikan themed MT started by Concordborn.  It was a victory against an opponent with an optimum rating of 1903.  This is a long game spanning 69 moves.  I managed to be a pawn up in a Q & P ending and to shepherd my extra pawn to Glendadom.  Meanwhile Henry had to run the gauntlet from the Wicked Witch of the West.  He did this by using an enemy pawn as a Human Shield.  After that his two wives then covered him aaaah!  Once the checks ran out my opponent waved the white flag.  Here is how it happened folks - firstly here is the Gameknot Analysis.   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17526707&rnd=0.10930306846589815"

1149,34,16,4c4,b'8/6pk/p6p/8/1PPQ3P/8/4q1PK/8 b - -',41. c4 - it will be this pawn that will crown however.  Only another 4 squares to go but they will be tortuous steps.
1150,34,17,4c5,b'8/6pk/p6p/2P5/1P1Q3P/8/2q3PK/8 b - -',42. c5 - make that 3.
1151,34,18,4c6,b'7k/6p1/p1P4p/8/1P2Q2P/8/6PK/2q5 b - -',44. c6 - only 2 to go.
1152,34,19,4Kf2,b'7k/6p1/p1P4p/8/1P2Q2P/8/5KP1/2q5 b - -',46. Kf2 - Henry is eyeing up the top of the board.  He intends to seek shelter there against any checks from the Wicked Witch.
1153,34,20,5c7,b'3Q4/2P3pk/p6p/8/1P5P/8/5KP1/2q5 b - -',50. c7 - a series of queen checks enables my pawn to be just one square from Glendadom.  But now Henry must run the gauntlet from the Wicked Witch of the West.
1154,34,21,5Kg3,b'3Q4/2P3pk/p6p/5q2/1P5P/6K1/6P1/8 b - -',54. Kg3 - Henry hatches his escape plan.
1155,34,22,5Kd3,b'3Q4/2P3pk/p6p/4q3/1P5P/3K4/6P1/8 b - -',57. Kd3 - Henry makes towards his queenside footman but will this be shelter enough?
1156,34,23,6Kb3,b'3Q4/2P3pk/p6p/1q6/1P5P/1K6/6P1/8 b - -',60. Kb3 - whew - at last Henry has found some refuge as the Witch has no checking lines available.  Any non checking move will allow my c7 pawn to crown.
1157,34,24,6c8=Q,b'2QQ4/6pk/7p/pq6/1P5P/1K6/6P1/8 b - -',61. c8/Q - Voila!
1158,34,25,6Kc2,b'2QQ4/6pk/7p/p7/1q5P/8/2K3P1/8 b - -',62. Kc2 - Henry must run the gauntlet yet again.  At least with two queens on the board it will be easier to cover Henry as more squares will be controlled by both these ladies.  I just hope I can engineer a cross-check which will force off the Witch.
1159,34,26,6Kc4,b'2QQ4/6pk/7p/p7/2K4P/8/6P1/3q4 b - -',64. Kc4 - with both queens defending each other Henry has no fear of running into a skewer.
1160,34,27,6Ka6,b'2QQ4/6pk/K6p/p7/7P/8/1q4P1/8 b - -',66. Ka6! - Henry was really tempted to gobble up that nice tasty juicy p(r)awn on a5.  But he restrains himself from this because he realises that he can use this pawn as a human shield to shelter behind.  Black cannot now check Henry from the front so he must now find another way.
1161,34,28,6Qb6,b'2Q5/K5pk/1Q5p/p7/7P/8/5qP1/8 b - -',68. Qb6 - After being on this square for many moves Glenda is finally able to cover her other half.
1162,34,29,6Qcb7,b'8/KQ3qpk/1Q5p/p7/7P/8/6P1/8 b - -',69. Qcb7 - and so does her clone Henry is sooo lucky having those two ladies to snuggle up to.  My opponent acknowledges that Henry is now safe and all I have to do is to plonk a queen on the b1 to a7 diagonal when the Witch moves off her second rank and I will either force an exchange of queens or if black dodges this exchange he can cop Old Matey.  This acknowledgement comes in the form of the white flag.  This puts me back to my optimum rating of 1883 just 17 points short of 1900.  Be really lurvely to get there.  But for now that's all folks bye for now - Joanne

1232,35,69,5Ra3+,b'8/p7/2pp4/8/1P2N1k1/r3K3/8/8 w - -',I wonder if all those checks were worthwhile because they didn't really benefit me too much so far.
1233,35,70,5Kd2,b'8/p7/2pp4/8/1P2N1k1/r7/3K4/8 b - -',It's best to settle for a pawn exchange I suppose.
1234,35,71,5Nf7,b'8/p4N2/2p5/8/1r4k1/8/3K4/8 b - -',The threat is the fork winning a pawn. 
1235,35,72,5Rb3,b'8/p4N2/2p5/8/6k1/1r6/3K4/8 w - -',I don't know why I ignored it since 53...Kf4 was better.
1236,35,73,a6,b'8/8/p1N5/8/5k2/1r6/3K4/8 w - -',I realize that if I lose the Rook not only is it going to be a draw game I will be two points down.

1240,35,77,5Na1,b'8/8/p7/3k4/8/7r/2K5/N7 b - -',I think my opponent took this a little bit too hard.
1241,35,78,5Kc4,b'8/8/p7/8/2k5/7r/2K5/N7 w - -',With the Knight having useless squares to go to I decide to try to take advantage of the situation and push the King to its doom.
1242,35,79,a5,b'8/8/8/p7/2k5/7r/1K6/N7 w - -',Also playable are 60...Rc3 and 60...Kb4.
1243,35,80,6Kc2,b'8/8/8/p7/2k5/7r/2K5/N7 b - -',An idea is 61...Rh2+ forcing the King to a helpless row while the Knight isn't doing too much.

1246,35,83,6Re3,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/p3r3/K7/N7 w - -',This move threatens a King and Rook vs. King endgame and that's the best I can do right now.
1247,35,84,6Nc2,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/p3r3/K1N5/8 b - -',I expected this move and sucessfully pin it to the King.
1248,35,85,6Re2,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/p7/K1N1r3/8 w - -',This is what I mean when I say that it threatens a King and Rook endgame. The pawn is hanging but it is all part of the goal of eliminating the Knight.
1249,35,86,6Kb1,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/p7/2N1r3/1K6 b - -',With this expected move I have to be very careful as this is a fragile and expensive opportunity. If I play this wrong it's a draw.
1250,35,87,6a2+,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/8/p1N1r3/1K6 w - -',!? Risks a draw!

With white's queen and rook lined up white can advance the center pawns and push black back. White can also push the pawns to threaten pieces in order to get material superiority.

The black queen is exposed to attack but that doesn't matter since white's king is under attack and the black queen is free to move! This was the true purpose of advancing the pawn to c4 - to give the knight a perch from where it can check the king. If Kb1 then Nxe1 followed by Rxe1 Qxe1 with white down two rooks. The same happens if Kc2 or Kd2.
1309,38,21,2Qxd3,b'4rrk1/4qppp/p7/1p5P/2p2Bb1/P1PQ4/BP4P1/2K1R2R b - -',The only way for white to avoid losing two rooks with nothing in return is to sacrifice a queen!
1310,38,22,2Qxe1+,b'4rrk1/5ppp/p7/1p5P/2p2Bb1/P1PQ4/BP4P1/2K1q2R w - -',Black doesn't accept white's sacrifice just yet. Instead black sacrifices his own queen instead! If white moves the king to c2 now black picks off the other rook as a prize. If Qd2 blocks then a series of exchanges on e1 leaves black ahead with two rooks against two bishops. (Qxe1 followed by Rxe1 and Bxe1 and Kxe1 and Rd8+.) No move leads to a good outcome for white.
1311,38,23,2Rxe1,b'4rrk1/5ppp/p7/1p5P/2p2Bb1/P1PQ4/BP4P1/2K1R3 b - -',White accepts the queen sacrifice and appears to have material superiority. (Actually white does not have effective material superiority since the white queen is ready to be taken and both bishops are too far from the action to influence events.)

1315,38,27,2Kxd3,b'5rk1/5ppp/p7/1p5P/5Bb1/P1PK4/BP4P1/4r3 b - -',If the king moved to b3 instead then black would counter with Bd1+ king moves to b4 followed by Re4+ which forces white to lose the dark square bishop. If the king moved to d2 to block the pawn on d3 then white would move Rd1+ Ke3 Re8+ followed soon by mate. White's best option here was probably to avenge the queen by taking the pawn.
1316,38,28,2Rd8+,b'3r2k1/5ppp/p7/1p5P/5Bb1/P1PK4/BP4P1/4r3 w - -',Moving the rook to d8 pushes the king back into a corner.

(Kb1 Ba4+ then Bc1 to block followed by Rd8d1 to line up the rooks for mate. White would only have a few delaying tactics after that.)

However I am not going to drive it away.  As I had mentioned in my last annotation it can be harmful if you become obsessed with chasing pieces.  For that reason I am going to continue with my defense.  In addition he has left his d4 pawn unprotected.  Therefore I am going to win a free pawn after 3...cxd4.

Therefore I will win a free pawn with my knight if he does not retreat carefully.  BTW I am not attempting tempo but I am trying to win free material.  However this does not guarantee victory and it is a waste of time.  That will be explained shortly.
1330,39,9,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/6B1/2BpP1b1/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',!! He retreats wisely.  In fact this was his best move and I will explain it shortly.
1331,39,10,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/2BpP1b1/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',?? On a normal basis I would this two exclamation points because I originally thought that he was threatening my rook.  However I would still be able to protect it with this move if Qxb7 was played.  On the other hand this turns out to be a major blunder because he is going to place me in a very serious check after 7.Bxf7+.  Therefore I am going to loose my chance to castle so my king will remain exposed throughout the entire.  In the past I have lost several chess games from this type of mistake.  That is why 6...e6 would have been my best move.

1333,39,12,Qc7,b'r4b1r/pQqkpBpp/2np1n2/6B1/3pP1b1/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ -',This is forced.  I originally thought that I could protect with my king but that would be illegal.  Therefore this is my only move.  Right now things are looking very bad for black because he will win a free rook after 9.Qxa8.  As a result I will 6 points behind instead of a point ahead.

On a normal basis you would think that the game is almost lost for black.  However white has made a serious game that will cost him the game.  That will be explained momentarily.

In fact ""this looses immediately"" as Mr. Stockel would say.  It turns out to be a deflective sacrifice because I now have an inevitable mating move.  Therefore I will mate him in one with 12...Qc1#.  That is btw why it is called Back Rank Mate.  Afterall I am going to mate him on the back rank.

Jack Stockel strongly agrees with this assessment.  He has said that it is very hard to catchup if your opening is weak.  However there are also times where you can play and/or end well despite a weak opening.  That was shown in this game.  IM i-have-arrived emphasized that in my thread about opening games.  Having said that I would like to thank i-have-arrived for making this point.  By doing this he has helped to make this annotation possible."
