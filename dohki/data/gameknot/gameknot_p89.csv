2,0,2,1b4,b'2kr3r/1pp1q1p1/2n1b3/p1b2p1p/1PPp2n1/P2Q1NP1/1B1NPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',It looks like a common pawn sac--it is instead the beginning of the end.
3,0,3,1axb4,b'2kr3r/1pp1q1p1/2n1b3/2b2p1p/1pPp2n1/P2Q1NP1/1B1NPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Black is forced to take because if 15... Ba7 16.c5 and White's advantage became clear.
4,0,4,Nxb4,b'2kr3r/1pp1q1p1/4b3/2b2p1p/1nPp2n1/3Q1NP1/1B1NPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',If 16... Bxb4 the d4 pawn is lost
5,0,5,Nc6,b'2kr3r/1pp1q1p1/2n1b3/2b2p1p/2Pp2n1/1Q3NP1/1B1NPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',White was threatening at least 18.Ra8+ (or 18.h3!) with revenge on d4 pawn.
6,0,6,1Bxd4,b'2kr3r/1pp1q1p1/1bn1b3/1Q3p1p/2PB2n1/5NP1/3NPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',19.Bxd4!! This sac depends by previous one and allows the following on move 21
7,0,7,2Qxb7+,b'2k4r/1Qp1q1p1/2n1b3/5p1p/2Pr2n1/6P1/3NPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',21.Qxb7+!! This sac is wonderfully possible thanks to the strategic placement of Bg2.
8,0,8,Qa3,b'2k4r/2p3p1/2B1b3/5p1p/2Pr2n1/q5P1/3NPP1P/RR4K1 w - -',To escape from mating net in fact 23... Kd8; 24.Rb8+ Bc8 and 25.Rxc8+
9,0,9,2Rb8+,b'1Rk4r/2p3p1/2B1b3/5p1p/2Pr2n1/q5P1/3NPP1P/R5K1 b - -',24.Rb8+!! White finds the most elegant way to end this genial match little known but that fully deserve to be considered a chess masterpiece.
10,0,10,2Rxa3,b'1k5r/2p3p1/2B1b3/5p1p/2Pr2n1/R5P1/3NPP1P/6K1 b - -',and Black resigned.
11,1,0,f4,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4PP2/1NN1B2P/PPP3P1/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',I dont agree for white f4. Ä°t is too early for open the wite king's front. Espacially black situation is strong for attacking.  
12,1,1,exf4,b'rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/8/4Pp2/1NN1B2P/PPP3P1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',obvious white want to attack early.
13,1,2,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/8/4PBP1/1NN4P/PPP1Q3/R3KB1R b KQ g3',white try to take advantage for playing g4. Thats the weak side for black.
14,1,3,b5,b'2rq1rk1/3nbpp1/p2pbn1p/1p6/4PBP1/1NN1Q2P/PPP5/2KR1B1R w - b6',Black also want to attack b4. The same tactic for white. Both white and black attack the same side.
15,1,4,Ne5,b'1r3rk1/2q1bpp1/p2pbn1p/1p2n3/3QPBP1/PNN4P/1PP5/1K1R1B1R w - -',black take an advantage and control for middle.

17,1,6,2Bd3,b'5rk1/4b1p1/prqppn1p/1p2n3/3QP1P1/P1NB2BP/1PP5/1K1R3R b - -',21 
18,1,7,2a5,b'5rk1/4b1p1/1rqppn1p/pp2n3/3QP1P1/P1NB2BP/1PP5/1K1R3R w - -',Black is sligtly stuck white kings. Quenn and castle has a huge advantage for attacking left side. Also black other castles can be help with Rb8. 
19,1,8,b4,b'5rk1/4b1p1/1rqppn1p/p3n3/1p1QP1P1/P2B2BP/1PP1N3/1K1R3R w - -',Black continue to attack.

22,1,11,Nxe4,b'5rk1/4b1p1/1q1pp2p/p3n3/1r2n1P1/2QB2BP/1PP5/1KNR3R w - -',Thats the tactic with black. Sacriface the knight with develop attack dangerously.
23,1,12,Bf6,b'5rk1/6p1/1q1ppb1p/p3n3/1r2B1P1/2Q3BP/1PP5/1KNR3R w - -',Thats it this move makes white in danger. Also weak points of b2 pawn with this move is nightmare. Also White has to escape queen but it makes worst for b2. Resignation for white !!!!
24,2,0,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I don't know what this Sicilian is called. Not the most common I think.

26,2,2,1Qc1,b'r4rk1/pp1q1pbp/2nppnp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',I suppose he was trying to eliminate my dark squared bishop and weaken my kingside defence but I think Qd2 might have been better.

28,2,4,Ngf5,b'r4rk1/pp1qnp1p/4p1pQ/3pPn2/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',I just wanted a strong knight on f5.

31,2,7,Qe8,b'r3q3/pp2n1kp/4prpn/3pN1Q1/3P2P1/2N5/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Didn't want to allow the knight to go to b5. At the same time I wanted to exchange my h6 knight for his e5 knight and thought that after exchanging knights on f7 by recapturing on f7 with my queen I'd gain some initiative or momentum or whatever.
32,2,8,Qxf7,b'r7/pp2nqkp/4p1p1/3p1rP1/3P3Q/2N5/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',I liked this for black. Maybe I was wrong. Somebody prove me wrong if you can.
33,2,9,2Nc7,b'r5k1/ppN1nq1p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3P1r2/8/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',Not loving this move for white. Might have been the biggest mistake of the game.
34,2,10,2Rg4+,b'r5k1/ppN1nq1p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3P2r1/8/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',After this I don't think white stands a chance.

36,2,12,2Rf8,b'5rk1/ppN1nq1p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3P2r1/8/PP3P1P/R3RK2 w - -',Could have played Qf3 but thought this was more forcing.
37,2,13,2Re2,b'5rk1/ppN1nq1p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3P2r1/8/PP2RP1P/R4K2 b - -',I expected this and knew this wasn't a good enough defence but I don't really think there was any good defence.
38,2,14,2Qf3,b'5rk1/ppN1n2p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3P2r1/5q2/PP2RP1P/R4K2 w - -',After this I thought he'd resign. But he didn't.
39,2,15,Rxd4,b'5rk1/ppN1n2p/4p1pQ/3p2P1/3r4/5q2/PP2RP1P/R3K3 w - -',Maybe there were better moves but I found this the most crushing. Any moves other than Qxf8 and Qh3 lead to quick checkmates. Maybe even Qg7+ stops a quick checkmate as well. I did not see/consider Qxf8 and Qg7 as viable options for him since they would mean surrendering his queen and/or resigning.
40,2,16,3Qxf8+,b'5Qk1/ppN1n2p/4p1p1/3p2P1/3r4/5q2/PP2RP1P/R3K3 b - -',I actually didn't see this and thought for a while on this move. I was a bit stunned to see that he hadn't resigned and it was my turn to move since I had set conditional moves which led to checkmate for every single move he could make except this one and Qh3. I also did not see Qg7+ which might not be as good as Qxf8 but it saves his king from getting mated as well.
41,2,17,3Kxf8,b'5k2/ppN1n2p/4p1p1/3p2P1/3r4/5q2/PP2RP1P/R3K3 w - -',If 31. ...Qxf8 32. Nxe6 and we'll be even in material or close to it.

43,2,19,3Ke3,b'8/pp2nk1p/6p1/3p2P1/3N4/4K3/PP2RP1P/q7 b - -',After moving his king he resigned.
44,3,0,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq a3',"Hi everyone!

This opening is the Meadow Hay Opening and it comes from Easy19's suggestion that I create a themed MT out of this opening.  I ended up playing against a very strong expert in this MT and I seemed to be doing OK.  But then my opponent conjured up Old Matey out of nowhere.  I could have avoided copping this mate but only at the cost of ruinous loss of material.  So how did this happen?  Firstly I will begin commentary with black's move on Move 4 because that is where the fixed moves end.  The database has completely run out so each player is on their own."
45,3,1,Nxa6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/n7/3ppp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',4. ..... Nxa6 - there are several ways to capture this pawn either with the b7 pawn or with the knight.  My opponent chooses the knight.
46,3,2,bxa6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/p7/3ppp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',5. .... bxa6 - this B for N trade splits up black's queenside pawns and may facilitate material restoration later on.
47,3,3,b3,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/p7/3ppp2/8/1P2P3/2PP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',6. b3 - this move prepares a fianchetto on the queenside and a possible move to c4 to try and break up black's strong pawn centre.
48,3,4,d3,b'r1bqk2r/p1p3pp/p2b1n2/3ppp2/8/1P1PP3/1BP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',8. d3 - preparing Nd2.
49,3,5,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p5pp/p2b1n2/2pppp2/8/1P1PP3/1BP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',10. 0-0 - with my opponent castled kingside you wouldn't think I was castling into it would you?
50,3,6,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/pb4pp/p2b1n2/2pppp2/8/1P1PP3/1BPNNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',11. Nd2 - my development is nearly complete but black has a big spatial edge.  What an impressive wall of black pawns on the 5th rank!
51,3,7,Qf7,b'3r1rk1/pb3qpp/p2b1n2/2pppp2/8/1P1PP3/1BPNNPPP/R1Q1R1K1 w - -',13. ..... Qf7 - this is the start of black's dastardly plan.

54,3,10,1Nf1,b'3r1r1k/pb4pp/p2b1n1q/2pppp2/8/1P1PPP2/1BP1N1PP/R1Q2NRK b - -',17. Nf1 - this knight comes down and protects Henry against mate threats on the h column.  It also protects my vulnerable e3 pawn which is now defended by our poor put upon Glenda!
55,3,11,1f4,b'3r1r1k/pb4pp/p2b1n1q/2pp1p2/4pP2/1P1PP3/1BP1N1PP/R1Q2NRK b - -',18. f4 - an attempt to block off the line of attack of black's dsb.
56,3,12,1Ng4,b'3r1r1k/pb4pp/p2b3q/2pp1p2/4pPn1/1P1PP3/1BP1N1PP/R1Q2NRK w - -',18. ..... Ng4 - allo allo allo suddenly Henry is now in Old Matey's shadow!  Only his dearly beloved better half can defend him now so Glenda moves to e1 on the next turn.
57,3,13,2Bc1,b'3r1r1k/pb4pp/p2b3q/2p2p2/3ppPn1/1P1PP3/2P1N1PP/R1B1QNRK b - -',20. Bc1 - to bolster e3.  Now comes a plethora of exchanges that turn out to be an unmitigated disaster for Yours Truly.
58,3,14,Rfe8,b'3rr2k/pb4pp/p2b3q/2p2p2/5Pn1/1P1PB3/4N1PP/R3QNRK w - -',23. Qg3?? - I think this was my fatal mistake.  I think Bd2 had to be played here.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
59,3,15,Rxe3,b'3r3k/pb4pp/p2b3q/2p2p2/5Pn1/1P1Pr1Q1/4N1PP/R4NRK w - -',23. ..... Rxe3!! a brilliant exchange sac!
60,3,16,Qxh2+,b'3r3k/pb4pp/p2b4/2p2p2/5Pn1/1P1PN1Q1/4N1Pq/R5RK w - -',24. .... Qxh2+!!! - followed by a brilliant queen sacrifice.  Mate cannot be avoided.  Next move I am 9 points up in material but down a king! Sigh and double Sigh!  Not the usual Philidor's Legacy!  Never mind I did have the consolation over the weekend by managing to add to my tally of Expert Draws with my secret weapon Operation Joblock.  I will be annotating this game this week so watch this space!

85,5,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Philidor defense all book so far. I continue with immediately attacking the attempted black fort a decent plan although if black defends accurately black can get a good game.
86,5,1,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black correctly responds and could have a good game with further accurate responses. However from here many inaccuracies begin to accumulate.
87,5,2,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A slow developing move I rather dislike and I consider it an inaccuracy even though it's debateable. No real harm at this point.
88,5,3,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',f7 is the first target I will go after. As it turns out my positioning at a traditional weak point leads to something greater due to black inaccuracies. So far white is ideally positioning. Developing with clear lines of threat and power positioned towards an objective while at the same time satisfying the requirements of defense.
89,5,4,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1ppp/3p1n2/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move is okay but other possibities existed too. Perhaps his choice of this move at this time is slightly inaccurate however. Does it serve a greater purpose? Did black really think I would advance the e pawn in this position? He knows there is no real threat on the e pawn by his developing move. Why would I wish to trade in the center? I don't. Perhaps better was Qf6 or even Qe7 for black at this time. And for white? Next up: a developing move that also protects that pawn.
90,5,5,Nc3,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1ppp/3p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',An f pawn move was also a good choice.
91,5,6,h6,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1pp1/3p1n1p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Unnecessary and a waste of a tempo. The black bishop could be easily chased with tempo rather than this h pawn move.
92,5,7,a6,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',I consider this another even bigger inaccuracy than the last although it could be useful if white neglects to account for it and the safety of his e pawn. I don't plan to not account for it and if you play a decent opponent neither will they.
93,5,8,a4,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq a3',So I decide to account for it. Stopping b5 although f4 was very very strong in this position. In case my opponent survived the tactical threats that f4 would have allowed I don't want him crashing pawns down on the queenside with tempo.
94,5,9,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p1np1n1p/8/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black seems to realize this and just develops. Not a bad move here. Fritz says I should trade knights now. Eh I'd rather...
95,5,10,Kh1,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p1np1n1p/8/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1R1K b kq -',Do this. Prophylactic move. I'm a strong believer in getting the king out of the diagonal opened up by an f pawn advance something Fritz can't properly recognize way before such a move shows it's benefit. Whether or not trading knights was best or whether this move turns out to be useful or not to me I don't lose much doing this now.
96,5,11,Ne5,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/4n3/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1R1K w kq -',Another inaccuracy - in my eyes. Here black chooses a continuation that surprised me. Trading with the white knight is what I expected or some other developing move. The key here is black should play for equality and then seek the advantage. This move... not sure what it gains other than the tempo by the slight bishop retreat. Which begs the question: is the tempo worth having the black knight there? I don't think so. Perhaps this knight is but on a journey and could operate on the kingside later but it's easy to target where it is and black needs to be careful about threat tactics from white in this position.Black 's setup says castle kingside. Does he?
97,5,12,1Bb3,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/4n3/P2NP3/1BN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1R1K b kq -',Keeping as many options on the table for that white bishop as I can.
98,5,13,1Qe7,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqpp1/p2p1n1p/4n3/P2NP3/1BN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1R1K w kq -',And now I think black has made a mistake here; but thinking to castle queenside so it would seem. At any rate the queen is not in a good place now unless black quickly castles because of the possible white pawn advances with tempo in the center and the possibility of the rook coming to e1. Black should quickly castle queenside. Having one's queen in front of one's king when that file may open up is nearly always a very bad idea. The other idea behind this move? A discovered attack to win the e pawn will only happen if I allow some threat for the black knight on e5 to move to with the e pawn as yet underprotected. Again a good opponent won't allow this and so the drawbacks to black's move in my eyes is worse than the possible benefit. Hence I call it an inaccuracy.
99,5,14,1Re1,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqpp1/p2p1n1p/4n3/P2NP3/1BN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQR2K b kq -',Protecting e4 again and xraying the black queen/king. Of all the moves black has made for a while he finally chooses one Fritz likes...
100,5,15,1g5,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1n1p/4n1p1/P2NP3/1BN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQR2K w kq g6',g5. There is no way I am just going to allow black to crash those pawns down without my own countering threats. Nf5 was one choice as was f4 both according to Fritz. But after a brief think I moved the quiet...
101,5,16,1f3,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1n1p/4n1p1/P2NP3/1BN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',...f3. Here I deviate from pure positional concerns and calculations. Because black moved the pawn during play so quickly a little psychology comes into play here. I suspect he may move that pawn or those kingside pawns again an expectation based not on what the board shows but how my opponent has played. But if he does I immediately recognized the potential my white centralized pawns possess; black could be in for a nasty surprise. Here I really expected a continuing close game in this position with the black g pawn staying put. Black has made more than few inaccuracies me a couple; but the position is still tenable for both sides here. But those inaccuracies now if a mistake is made allowing me to take advantage of them can be quite costly.
102,5,17,1g4,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1n1p/4n3/P2NP1p1/1BN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K w kq -',Well it was tenable but not anymore; here black can resign. It's not difficult to see look at the continuations. Crashing down pawns before castling or fully developing is usually not wise depending on the positional considerations; here this loses tactically. Note that if I took the pawn black would gain greatly from it. But did he see what would happen because of his position if I did not? Black needs to castle but has no more time to. So like a ladder of threats to the black king I order the knaves to climb it.
103,5,18,1f4,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1n1p/4n3/P2NPPp1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',1st the threat on the e5 knight. It's interesting that often really good moves end up being positioned to really take advantage of one's opponent's inaccuracies. If you play games that just seem to flow together good into a winning game it's likely because you have your pieces in good places on the board to begin with. ;)
104,5,19,1Ng6,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1nnp/8/P2NPPp1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K w kq -',Black should not be trying to save the knights here; there is worse ahead. I continue...
105,5,20,1e5,b'r3kb1r/1ppbqp2/p2p1nnp/4P3/P2N1Pp1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',Black does not want to lose material but he should just castle...
106,5,21,Ng8,b'r3kbnr/1ppbqp2/p5np/4P3/P2N2p1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K w kq -',Black could not take the pawn with the knight because of Bf4. And again should have just castled. But now even worse is about to happen! Black 's moves lead to...
107,5,22,1e6,b'r3kbnr/1ppbqp2/p3P1np/8/P2N2p1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',...and now we see how efficient developing moves of white contrast with black's rather inaccurate opening development because of black's misstep on move 13. With better and more accurate developing moves black would likely escape with just a poorer position or perhaps something like just a pawn down. But in this game Fritz gives white a plus ten here. Ouch.
108,5,23,1Nxe6,b'r3kbnr/1ppbq3/p3N1np/8/P5p1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',The best move. Black has no decent defense and cannot even castle queenside and will still lose material or be checkmated. The knaves climbed that threat ladder and now the heavy pieces extract their toll...
109,5,24,1Bc6,b'r3kbnr/1pp1q3/p1b1N1np/8/P5p1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K w kq -',Ah well. This last blunder born of a desire to not lose material allows mate in one and you bet I don't miss it. It was all the other inaccuracies on black's part that led to this in the first place.
110,5,25,1Nxc7#,b'r3kbnr/1pN1q3/p1b3np/8/P5p1/1BN5/1PP3PP/R1BQR2K b kq -',This 1500 or so rated player would have played far better in a long game than he does here due to the cumulative effect of all of his little inaccuracies that lead to this unfortunate ending for the black army and the lack of time to really think over a position. Avoidable - of course - with better understanding of positional considerations or more time to think. If you struggle to remember reams of book lines or calculating more than a few moves ahead - then get really good at understanding the why of moves and positions; you'll be far less likely to go wrong. Chess is really a war of ideas and one is either right or wrong. When your idea is better than your opponent's then of course chances are you' 'll come out ahead. Hope you enjoyed this short game!
111,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So they decide to open with the usual King Pawn opening.
112,6,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And once again I decide to break my usual muscle memory by responding with e5. Instead I try to work toward a more unusual Najdorf Sicilian.
113,6,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',And- right there. I was trying to take the game into a direction I wasn't familiar with by at least playing a Najdorf by the main lines. Instead my opponent beats me to it by trying something even more bold on their end- the Grand Prix! The moment I saw f4 I knew I was in for a complicated game. As a King Pawn player with White I have main line experience against the Sicilian. I rarely ever attempt one myself but this is my first time ever seeing a Grand Prix. I would never be able to pull one of these off as of now and now I have to think of ways to defend against it?! Luckily for me though the high rated players on Gameknot absolutely love this opening and I was able to find plenty of helpful annotated games to give me ideas on how to defend what to expect and just what exciting turns this game could have unfolding into the battlefield...
114,6,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Apparently this move is why you don't normally see e4-f4 in the first two moves. Especially not among the masters- they normally try e4 c5 Nc3 Nc6 f4! Personally I don't see why either line aids or impairs either color but that's just due to lack of experience on my end. I was still at least interested in seeing where this game was going. What line will White try to lead me down for their attempt at victory?
115,6,4,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',(?) - They take the d pawn! Now we're transposing into Scandinavian lines... and now to say I'm overly uncomfortable would be the massive understatement of the year. As White I love playing the Scandinavian regardless if we go into the main line or not. I never touch it as Black. But now Black must play the Scand after trying Sicilian and meeting the Grand Prix. This game's stakes just got raised on my end.
116,6,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pP4/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I really don't have much choice about Nf6. I have a lot of experience with the Scand and I know all too well how easy it is to punish Black after Qxd5 (like say with Nc3?). This game can still go anywhere and I can only hope that White here doesn't know this line of Grand Prix too well either...
117,6,6,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pP4/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',We have now made a full transition into the Scandinavian main lines.
118,6,7,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I decide to stick by them and see where White wants to go with this.
119,6,8,dxe6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4Pn2/2p5/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',(?) - Except this line of the Scandinavian works better when there is NOT a c5 pawn in play.
120,6,9,Bxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2p5/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now I've got the better development. GK database has this position set to equal or strong chances for Black at this point in spite of being down a pawn.
121,6,10,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',(!?) - White decides to open up even more. I don't agree with this move. White continues to delay back rank piece development and d3 didn't even free the DSB all that much. If my opponent isn't careful they will allow Black to easily win the centre if this keeps going...
122,6,11,Nc6,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I decide to make good on my threat and develop my back rank pieces even further. Black now presents very clear threats to seize control of the board at this rate.
123,6,12,Nf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Finally! Out comes a back rank piece. But I still favor my chances.
124,6,13,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now I establish a fortress for Black and enable O-O.
125,6,14,Be2,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Q-side isn't developed nor safe enough for the exposed king to hide. The sooner the better.
126,6,15,Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',(!) - I've now enabled O-O-O while launching well aimed attacks on f4-g3-h2. If White plans O-O then this threat has to be addressed at once.
127,6,16,Qd2,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',If O-O then Bxf4 at no material loss. If g3 then eventually Bh3 deters O-O. Probably White's best.

129,6,18,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB2RK1 b - -',The king finally hides away into the kingside. The problem is he isn't even remotely safe yet...
130,6,19,1Nd4,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/2p5/2Pn1P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',(?) - There was probably a better move but I opted for the move that caused White the most disturbance to rub some more salt into the wounds of grief...
131,6,20,1b3,b'r4rk1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/2p5/2Pn1P2/1P1P1N2/P2QB1PP/RNB2RK1 b - -',(?) - I actually don't see a point to this move. Maybe White plans to fianchetto the DSB but isn't it needed to guard the f4 pawn right now?
132,6,21,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/2p5/2Pn1P2/1P1P1N2/P2QB1PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',I opted for creating more threats in winning control over the center targeting the weak LSB.
133,6,22,1Nxd4,b'r3r1k1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/2p5/2PN1P2/1P1P4/P2QB1PP/RNB2RK1 b - -',White decides that maybe the black knight is in a dangerous spot after all.
134,6,23,1cxd4,b'r3r1k1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/8/2Pp1P2/1P1P4/P2QB1PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',And I'm more than happy to remove a strong knight from the list of White's defenders. I'm also happy to see what direction White plans on taking now.
135,6,24,1Bb2,b'r3r1k1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/8/2Pp1P2/1P1P4/PB1QB1PP/RN3RK1 b - -',So now the DSB takes the square on b2 realizing the dangers that the lone pawn presents.
136,6,25,1Qb6,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q1bbn2/8/2Pp1P2/1P1P4/PB1QB1PP/RN3RK1 w - -',I decide that Black can let the f4 pawn live a little longer dominating the king's diagonal squares. White is forced to try something else a little bit different now.
137,6,26,1Bf3,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q1bbn2/8/2Pp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB1Q2PP/RN3RK1 b - -',(?) - I actually don't know why White did this. Maybe they didn't like the rook on e8. Maybe they want to threaten b7. Perhaps both but the threat doesn't appear all that real at the moment.
138,6,27,1Bb4,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q2bn2/8/1bPp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB1Q2PP/RN3RK1 w - -',(?) - This was a mistake. The attack on the Queen was a bit premature. Better would have been Bf5 and when I play Bb4 here then the queen retreats d3 is won and White's Q-side defenses unravel faster than a ball of yarn on a sewing machine.
139,6,28,1Qf2,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q2bn2/8/1bPp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB3QPP/RN3RK1 b - -',She retreats in front of the king here. My diagonal on the king is even stronger.
140,6,29,1Bc5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q2bn2/2b5/2Pp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB3QPP/RN3RK1 w - -',This basically resets the position but I realized that I can't continue with my plans if I allow White to play a3! here. I see what I need to do BEFORE trying Bb4 again (if the queen returns to d2).
141,6,30,1Nd2,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q2bn2/2b5/2Pp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB1N1QPP/R4RK1 b - -',(?) - The knight was trapped from the start. The problem isn't being fixed here (all of its squares are weak or occupied!) and now punishment is in store for my unfortunate opponent.
142,6,31,1Bf5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/1q3n2/2b2b2/2Pp1P2/1P1P1B2/PB1N1QPP/R4RK1 w - -',I launch an attack on the weak d3 pawn.

214,10,7,cxd4,b'rnb3Q1/ppkp4/4p2p/4N3/1qBpP2p/2N5/PPPK1PPP/R6R w - -',Pd6 I think leads to a knight or bishop.  Though yeah looks like you got Nc3.  Probably better.

227,11,10,Qe3+,b'r5k1/pp5p/6pb/2pp4/2P3bP/3PqP2/1P2K1P1/5B1R w - -',Nope.  Qd2#.  Black does not need a wall and is just drawing it out.

230,12,1,Bf8,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2p1n/4p3/1PB1P3/2PQ4/P2PNPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Mm I would not have moved it all the way back but would have left it on b6 or d6.  Black cannot cancel while white's bishop is checking g8 but returning Bf7 just means white gets a free move.

236,12,7,Nb7,b'r1b1kb1r/pn2q1pp/2pp1p1n/Q3P3/1Pp1P3/B1P5/P2PN1PP/RN2KR2 w Qkq -',Black is intent on pushing around the white queen.  White could respond with PxPf6 threatening the black queen in turn.  Nothing is protecting the e5 pawn except the queen and it will be lost if she moves to a4.  However PxPf6 could be answered by QxPe4.  White would remain down a pawn but the queen would be free to travel to the other side of the board--Qh5+.  Black would probably interpose the pawn (Pg6) answered by some other great move.  Pf7+ maybe.
237,12,8,1Qxc6+,b'r1b1kb1r/pn2q1pp/2Qp3n/4p3/1Pp1P3/B1P5/P2PN1PP/RN2KR2 b Qkq -',Yes.

239,12,10,2Qa4,b'r1b1kr2/pn1q2pp/5b1n/1P1pp3/Q2PP3/B1P3P1/P3N2P/RN2K1R1 b Qq -',I like Qb4 a little better.  The bishop behind the queen make for a formidable array though black could easily block with Be7 and there is always the entertaining possibility black may overlook BxRf8.
240,12,11,2Kf7,b'r1b2r2/pn1q1kpp/5b1n/1P1pp3/Q2PP3/B1P3P1/P3N2P/RN2K1R1 w Q -',Well you look at that?  BxRf8!

242,12,13,2Nxe4,b'r1b2r2/pn1q1kpp/5b1n/1P2p3/Q2PN3/B1P3P1/P3N2P/R3K1R1 b Q -',All right.  Does the black rook have warts?  Cheeky butt crack?  I'm telling you that rook looks like corn fed venison on the hoof.  BxRf8 can't be beat.  Especially with white down a point.
243,12,14,2Qd5,b'r1b2r2/pn3kpp/5b1n/1P1qp3/Q2PN3/B1P3P1/P3N2P/R3K1R1 w Q -',I'd still do it even though it would mean the loss of the knight.  Actually at this point NxB is pretty decent.  KxN eliminates the threat to the queen and then the black rook is completely free.  Dressed out and hanging in a tree.  Back strap for the her majesty's boys and venison chops for the following week.
244,12,15,2Qb4,b'r1b2r2/pn3kpp/5b1n/1P1qp3/1Q1PN3/B1P3P1/P3N2P/R3K1R1 b Q -',:(

Still a bishop and a pawn for a knight and then if black still wants to leave his rook on f8 the bishop at a3 can feast on it.  As it is nothing is protecting Ne4 from QxN.  White can't castle (queen's side) without losing the other knight to black's white bishop or the queen.
247,12,18,3Rf1,b'r4r2/pn3kpp/5b1n/1P6/2Ppq1b1/B5P1/P2QN2P/R3KR2 b Q -',?  The rook at f8.  BxRf8.  It doesn't have an STD.  It is just sitting there in the good bishop's crosshairs.
248,12,19,3Rae8,b'4rr2/pn3kpp/5b1n/1P6/2Ppq1b1/B5P1/P2QN2P/R3KR2 w Q -',Well now this is going to hurt.

250,12,21,3Kxf8,b'4rk2/pn4pp/5b1n/1P6/2Ppq1b1/6P1/P2QN2P/R3KR2 w Q -',???  BxN!  It is the only sane thing to do.  White must move the rook then the king can take that back row bishop and black can pick off a pawn to boot with Be7xPc4+.  Free knight pawn combo.
251,12,22,3Kd1,b'4rk2/pn4pp/5b1n/1P6/2Ppq1b1/6P1/P2QN2P/R2K1R2 b - -',That doesn't help.  BxN forks the king and rook.

285,14,0,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I normally play the Benko gambit however I've previously employed it a couple of times against this opponent and he seems to do well against my normal sort of set ups so I thought I would do well to deviate. After having someone play this very gambit against me I immediately decided I liked the look of it and knew I would have to give it a shot some time. Its called the Blumenfeld gambit. 
286,14,1,fxe6,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/4pn2/1Pp5/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Of course ...dxe6 would make no sense Now however it is true that blacks light squares have been weakened slightly but taking advantage of that wont be easy for white. Plus black will be able to make use of the f file in the future plus with a pawn advantage in the centre and by following up with ...b5 black will end up having alot of open lines and long temr activity which promises black a good game
287,14,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/4pn2/1Pp5/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I would probably play Nc3 myself in order to facilitate e4 giving white some claim in the centre himself
288,14,3,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/p3pn2/1Pp5/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is consistant black wishes to open up files on the queenside so that black can make full use of the long term qactivity black will have and use it to apply plenty of pressure against white in all three sectors of the board
289,14,4,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/p3pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I personally dont think this is the best way for white to really handle the position. In my opinion white would much rather get in e2-e4 and ideally that should be played in a single move this move also does nothing to stake any hold in the centre and it blocks in whites DSB. instead moves like 7.b6 7.bxa6 come to mind one other alternative that seems quite interesting is 7.Nc3!? with the idea of ...axb5 8.a4!?
290,14,5,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/pq2pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',threatening to win back the pawn which would bring back material equality in which case black would just have a positionally Superior game
291,14,6,Be2,b'rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/pq2pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',? seems too passive now black wins back the pawn which just leaves black supieror positionally. white should have tried either 8.bxa6 or 8.Nc3 and another thought that never occured to me but seems intriging is 8.a4!? intending to recapture with the bishop if black were to play 8...axb5
292,14,7,axb5,b'rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/1q2pn2/1pp5/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black is better here because I know have the a file to make use of as well which already has the rook on it which got active for free also I have a more space and a better central structure black will have more activity and mobility and white already seems like they might end up a little passive
293,14,8,1Na3,b'rnb1k2r/3pb1pp/1q2pn2/1pp5/8/N3PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',?! usually when a knight develops via a3 or h3 its intention is to carry on to c4 or f4 or else it is maneuvering to c2 or f2 usually in order to help facilitate some sort of pawn break. In this case black controls the c4 square so the knight is simply out of play on a3 and doesn't do anything with regards to the centre. redeploying to c2 doesn't accomplish anything since since a later b4 can easily be met with c4. With that in mind this knight move doesn't make any sense perhaps white was hoping I'd play ...b4 when the knight could make use of the c4 square but that's hope chess and making moves with the idea being to hope your opponent will voluntarily make a weakness is a bad way to play chess 
294,14,9,1Ba6,b'rn2k2r/3pb1pp/bq2pn2/1pp5/8/N3PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',simply maintaing my space gaining pawns integrety they restrict whites piece and leave him passive so it is in my best interest to keep them as they are
295,14,10,1a3,b'r4rk1/3pb1pp/bqn1pn2/1pp5/8/P3PN2/1PNBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',we can already see the effects of never having got in e4 by white because black controls more territory and whites pieces are getting in the way of each other it becomes very difficult for white to make useful moves it seems like white has been trying to get in a b4 break however this would be a mistake because it would leave a3 as weak and would give black a protected passed pawn
296,14,11,1Ne4,b'r4rk1/3pb1pp/bqn1p3/1pp5/4n3/P3PN2/1PNBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',centralising my knight and attacking the white bishop. whites position is already very bad since he has no play and blacks control of more territory and more active army give black a big advantage already
297,14,12,1b4,b'r4rk1/3pb1pp/bqn1p3/1pp5/1P2n3/P3PN2/2NBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',As I outlined ealier this move is a mistake because it leaves a3 weak (which also leaves the b4 square as a hole) and it gives black a protected passed pawn
298,14,13,1c4,b'r4rk1/3pb1pp/bqn1p3/1p6/1Pp1n3/P3PN2/2NBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Despite material being equal I think black is already close to winning. white suffers from a lack of space the a pawn is a weakness black has a better centre and more files and active plans basically white has no active play anywhere on the board so because white is passive balck can go into cat and mouse mode constantly improving the position of all the pieces and white cant do anything about it.
299,14,14,Bb7,b'r4rk1/1b1pb1pp/1qn1p3/1p6/1PpNn3/P3PN2/3BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',the bishop was no  longer serving any purpose on a6 so it redirects to the more promosing a8-h1 diagonal 
300,14,15,Bf6,b'r4rk1/1b1p2pp/1qn1pb2/1p6/1PpNn3/P3PN2/2QBBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',This move indirectly defends the well centralised black knight since 17.Qxe4? Nxd4! it also x-rays the rook on a1
301,14,16,Nxc3,b'r4rk1/1b1p2pp/1qn1pb2/1p6/1PpN4/P1n1PN2/2Q1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now that the bishop had made its way to an active diagonal I snap it off this also lines up the queen and rook on the same diagonal as my bishop so there is potential for tactics. However I'm not certain this is the optimal move because my knight was really strong on e4 and I had more space so I didnt need to exchange pieces the thing is however that blacks position is so strong at this point that most moves are very strong for black this move gives black the bishop pair and does nothing to actually harm blacks huge advantage 
302,14,17,Ne7,b'r4rk1/1b1pn1pp/1q2pb2/1p6/1PpN4/P1Q1PN2/4BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',This lets my bishop see and also gives my knight the chance to jump into either d5 or f5 
303,14,18,1Qd2,b'r4rk1/1b1pn1pp/1q2pb2/1p6/1PpN4/P3PN2/3QBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',gets out of site of my bishop
304,14,19,1Be4,b'r4rk1/3pn1pp/1q2pb2/1p6/1PpNb3/P3PN2/3QBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',it was possible to start my pawns rolling immediately but I thought there was no rush so I got my bishop outside of my pawn chain since ...d5 will be coming at some point and I can also redirect it to g6/f7
305,14,20,2Ra2,b'r4rk1/3pn1pp/1q2pb2/1p6/1PpNb3/P3PN2/R2QBPPP/5RK1 b - -',getting out of the line of my bishop but now black decides its time to begin marching the troops
306,14,21,2e5,b'r4rk1/3pn1pp/1q3b2/1p2p3/1PpNb3/P3PN2/R2QBPPP/5RK1 w - -',the onslought begins first this forces back the only centralised piece of whites
307,14,22,d5,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3b2/1p1pp3/1Pp1b3/P3PN2/R1NQBPPP/5RK1 w - d6',And now the second one comes rushing in ready to carry on to d4 and punch through the white ranks
308,14,23,2Nfe1,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3b2/1p1pp3/1Pp1b3/P3P3/R1NQBPPP/4NRK1 b - -',? really bad move this square is hardly an active square and now white is completly passive it is now very easy for black to get in ...d4 and white will be run over this also stops his rook entering the fray. I can only guess white was trying to do something with his f pawn or maybe put his bishop on f3 instead white should try to get his f1 rook working somehow Rd1 comes to mind
309,14,24,2Bg6,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p1pp3/1Pp5/P3P3/R1NQBPPP/4NRK1 w - -',...d4 right away would have been thematic however I felt no rush I've said several times that white is passive so black can take the time to get the pieces placed optimally before pressing onward. Bishops work best from long range so I place it on g6 where with the assistance of its patner on f6 they will work together to get the pawns steamrolling whites position it also prepars to move to f7
310,14,25,2Kh1,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p1pp3/1Pp5/P3P3/R1NQBPPP/4NR1K b - -',another move that does nothing for whites position I suspect white is devoid of any plans and so not knowing what eaxtly to do he makes this king move my hguess is he was thinking about mving the f pawn and did this so he wouldnt be in a pin. 
311,14,26,2d4,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p2p3/1Ppp4/P3P3/R1NQBPPP/4NR1K w - -',Here they come a central phalanx of pawns supporeted by the bishops is a wonderful thing to behold they can leave a trail of destruction in their wake as they push foward scared of no enemy piece
312,14,27,2Bf3,b'r4rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/1Ppp4/P4B2/R1NQ1PPP/4NR1K b - -',white finally gets a piece active however it is too late blacks pawns have already broken through
313,14,28,2Ra4,b'5rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/rPpp4/P4B2/R1NQ1PPP/4NR1K w - -',Placing the rook on the hole where it continues to target the weakness on a3 and it also prevents any ideas white may have had about undermining the black centre with a4 though bring the rook to a central file to further assist the dynamic duo was also good
314,14,29,2g3,b'5rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/rPpp4/P4BP1/R1NQ1P1P/4NR1K b - -',I can only guess he is giving hiself a square for the knight on e2 you know things have gone wrong when you have to make such a move
315,14,30,2d3,b'5rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/rPp5/P2p1BP1/R1NQ1P1P/4NR1K w - -',And they march the pawns are so strong infact that white immediatly gives up a piece
316,14,31,2Nxd3,b'5rk1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/rPp5/P2N1BP1/R1NQ1P1P/5R1K b - -',supported by the black bishops as they were white may have found the pawn duo delving yet deeper into the white position if he had not done this moves like ...c3 attacking the queen followed by ...d2 where the innocent pawns made their way all the way to the seventh rank where they can further be supported by the rooks leaves a grim impression
317,14,32,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/4n1pp/1q3bb1/1p6/rPp5/P2N1BP1/R1NQ1P1P/5R1K w - -',No need to immediatly take back
318,14,33,cxd3,b'3r2k1/4n1pp/5bb1/1p6/rP6/P2pPBP1/R1N4P/5R1K w - -',even now they continue to push white into further passivity
319,14,34,d2,b'3r2k1/4n1pp/5bb1/1p6/rP6/P3PBP1/R2p3P/4NR1K w - -',This is played with the a2 rook in mind it is already short on squares and this further cuts them off 
320,14,35,3Ng2,b'3r2k1/4n1pp/5bb1/1p6/rP6/P3PBP1/R2p2NP/5R1K b - -',After Nc2 Bf7 and the rook is gone however it is already game over the same idea cant be stopped
321,14,36,3Bf7,b'3r2k1/4nbpp/5b2/1p6/rP6/P3PBP1/R2p2NP/5R1K w - -',white resigns since he must give up further material. 32.Rc2 Bb3 followed by promoting the pawn white has no chance.
322,15,0,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Classical QGD (queen's gambit declined) opening. Still in use even at the highest levels
323,15,1,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',I personally favour c5 here (before Nc6) to open up the centre
324,15,2,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',to prevent an annoying break-in of the white knight and to solidify a possible queen-side pawn rush
325,15,3,a4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2pp4/P1PP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq a3',a bold advance; not bad but a3 might have been more careful. Or then developing a bishop

329,15,7,1Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1bn2/2bp4/P7/2N1PN2/1P1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',and the other bishop

331,15,9,1Qb6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/pqnbbn2/3p4/P7/2N1PN1P/1P1BBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',frees the rook interplay on the 8th row and prepares for Q-side attack
332,15,10,1Rb1,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/pqnbbn2/3p4/P7/2N1PN1P/1P1BBPP1/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',Rb1 is understandable but unnecessary. A developing move such as Bd3 had been better. If black had then taken the b pawn his queen would have quickly been in trouble. 13. Bd3 Qxb2 14. a5
333,15,11,1a5,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/pqnb1n2/P2p1b2/8/2N1PN1P/1P1BBPP1/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',excellent move!

335,15,13,1Nd4,b'2rq1rk1/1p3ppp/p2b1n2/n2p1b2/N2N4/4P2P/1P1BBPP1/2RQ1RK1 b - -',This is all right but a rook exchange at c8 was an alternative

340,15,18,1Nc4,b'3q1rk1/1p3ppp/p2b1nb1/3p4/N1nN4/2Q1P2P/1P1BBPP1/5RK1 w - -',note that 20. Bxc4 dxc4 21. Qxc4 leads to 21.....b5

422,18,28,2Qg5+,b'r7/pp1bkp2/2n1p3/6Q1/3p1n2/P1p1q3/2P1B1PP/3RK2R b K -',This came as a minor surprise: I was expecting Qg4 at once.  What the check does is bring the Black King closer to the centre and that had a bearing on the game as it happened.  I did consider playing 20...f6 but took what I thought to be the simpler course.
423,18,29,2Qg4,b'r7/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p1nQ1/P1p1q3/2P1B1PP/3RK2R b K -',Now the mate is 'off'.  But the relief column - the queen- has done no more than prevent the immediate storming of the walls.  Black has plenty of reserves to reinforce the storming party.
424,18,30,2Rg8,b'6r1/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p1nQ1/P1p1q3/2P1B1PP/3RK2R w K -',(!?) But Black is deriving as much profit from the siege of White's e2-square as he can.  Of course the rook isn't really 'en prise' no more was he two moves ago.  White can not touch him.  But White's queen has to move again getting driven in to the closely encircled defences.  ***  As it transpires Black had an even better move for the win!  Although off and on I did look at ...Ne5 I appear to have overlooked it at this juncture.  As it leaves White's Queen with no sensible moves and 21...Ne5  22.Rxd4ch leads simply to a huge loss of materialfor White the game might have ended right here.  Thanks to eduard352 for point this out (see comments).

I had intended to take the g-pawn here and was thinking which piece to do the taking.  Very attractive was 22...Nxg2ch  23.Kf1 Qxf3ch  24.Bxf3 Ne3ch winning the exchange (25...Nxd1) and I near as a toucher played it.  But then I saw something even better...
426,18,32,2Qxe2+,b'6r1/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p1n2/P1p2Q2/2P1q1PP/3RK2R w K -',(!) The quickest and easiest road to the win turns out to be this straightforward even brutish method.
427,18,33,2Kxe2,b'6r1/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p4/P1p5/2P1K1PP/3R3R b - -',Black's forlorn hope has been annihilated but in the process has cleared the breach for the troops following up.
428,18,34,2Rxg2+,b'8/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p4/P1p5/2P1K1rP/3R3R w - -',And this is the 'point' .  If the King moves anywhere but to d3 25...Rxc2 gives Black four (4!) passed pawns in the centre and an overwhelming game.  So I was not surprised to see White's next move...
429,18,35,2Kd3,b'8/pp1b1p2/2nkp3/8/3p4/P1pK4/2P3rP/3R3R b - -',But now White is in the toils of a mating net.  That is why at move 22 I decided not to play the Exchange winning line.
430,18,36,2Kd5,b'8/pp1b1p2/2n1p3/3k4/3p4/P1pK4/2P3rP/3R3R w - -',Threatens ...Ne5#.  The siege - the mating net - tightens.  There is no relief in sight.

433,18,39,2Rdb1,b'8/pp1b1p2/2n5/3kp3/3p4/P1pK4/2P3rP/1R2R3 b - -',It made no difference what White played mate would have happened in a move or two.
434,18,40,2Rd2#,b'8/pp1b1p2/2n5/3kp3/3p4/P1pK4/2Pr3P/1R2R3 w - -',White's 13th move set him back seriously but the decisive moment came 4 moves later after which Black was able to place the White King under a siege from which there was no escape. 
435,19,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',We've played so many openings I often don't have a firm plan. Here I am simply intending to quickly castle.
436,19,1,c4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Here my opponent chooses an aggressive continuation hoping to take advantage of black's somewhat passive play. I don't really plan to attack the center from the wings as this setup may imply. I will get my king to safety and then see where things stand before making any plans.
437,19,2,c6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Because of his aggressive pawn moves I deviate from my plan to castle immediately.
438,19,3,d5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',Not the most accurate move as it pretty much cedes a pawn and white retains a good initiative too if white chooses to go down that path. But rather than do this white has ideas of gaining a space advantage restricting black and making that positional advantage pay off later.
439,19,4,e5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pP3/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So white chooses e5. While less forcing initially he hopes for a long term advantage while limiting the black counterplay. After a short think I decide on a plan at this point.
440,19,5,Bf5,b'rn1qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pPb2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I will try to disrupt white's pawn structure where he intends to castle or just trade off the 'bad' bishop and then go from there. So it's a little plan not a long one. Often I enjoy positions that are even not best just because it avoids known book lines. 
441,19,6,c5,b'rn1qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/2PpPb2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Well it's a blitz game. The last white move c5 was not the best move but it was in keeping with his overall strategy of trying to bottle up black before attacking on one of the wings. After another short think I decide to allow my light-squared bishop to become trapped. Several moves from now you'll see why. But in evaluating this position which by the way is quite horrible for black that bishop is not worth much. I have allowed White to reduce the value of this bishop so I will trade it off even if it's for a couple kingside pawns. But this isn't the evaluating part of the game I wish to speak about just an incidental part of how the game went. Looks like very poor prospects for black here doesn't it.
442,19,7,e6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpPb2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Finally have a chess engine I can check accuracy of moves on and according to Fritz this is a very bad move. And Fritz is right. But stay tuned.

Learning from what the Grandmasters play is well and good of course; and I do that too. But sometimes I just like seeing the dynamics of positions that won't be found in theory.
444,19,9,Be4,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3Pb1P1/2N5/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Fritz is still loving white. In this position there are really only two choices that make sense. My opponent chooses the best move as he has done most of the game so far...
445,19,10,Qh4+,b'rn2k1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3Pb1Pq/2N2P2/PP5P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I love unbalanced positions like these. Things are being forced a certain way now; the white king must move Ke2 otherwise black gets an edge.
446,19,11,Qxg4,b'rn2k1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3P2q1/2N2N2/PP2K2P/R1BQ1B1R w kq -',Now this position in a regular long game I would not have allowed as black. But this is a Blitz 'for fun' game and my opponent does not really think this position out instead deciding to simply chase the queen with the h pawn. There were better moves were it not a blitz game that white could calculate out that would simply destroy black and many of our stronger players here would find them in a blitz game as well.
447,19,12,Qh5,b'rn2k1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP2q/3P4/2N2N1P/PP2K3/R1BQ1B1R w kq -',Still an overwhelming advantage for white. What would you do in a blitz game here where you aren't thinking the continuations all the way through? Perhaps develop a piece? That is what white chooses to do. He is thinking not incorrectly that he wishes to get his king out of the pin. But he chooses a move that Fritz does not like much.
448,19,13,1Bg2,b'rn2k1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP2q/3P4/2N2N1P/PP2K1B1/R1BQ3R b kq -',This is the first real white mistake because it gives me a tempo to do something besides allow my position to get worse and worse.

450,19,15,1Kf1,b'rn2k2r/pp2npbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP2q/3P4/2N2N1P/PP4B1/R1BQ1K1R b kq -',Now white has gotten away from the pin. 
451,19,16,1Nf5,b'rn2k2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpPn1q/3P4/2N2N1P/PP4B1/R1BQ1K1R w kq -',White knows he's winning and has allowed his attention to stay around his King in an attempt to consolidate his advantage. In accordance with that idea Ne2 would be a very good move for white in this position. However for some inexplicable reason white decides he has to do more to take the pressure off of his king even if it means giving a little something back. In actuality his king is not in as much danger as he thinks as black does not have much firepower compared to the available white defenders. As a result he makes a very poor move here on move 14 essentially equalizing the game for black.
452,19,17,1Nh2,b'rn2k2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpPn1q/3P4/2N4P/PP4BN/R1BQ1K1R b kq -',Talk about a blunder. You think you see it? Many of you might overlook it. Here is where our evaluation of a chess position must be as dynamic as the position is. Do you see that Ng3 might look tempting? And in the game it was. Most of you would first trade the queens. And so as could be expected I did that.
453,19,18,1Nxd1,b'rn2k2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpPn2/3P4/7P/PP4BN/R1BN1K1R b kq -',Here is the pivotal position of the game and the one I alluded at the beginning of the game. White has a minor piece and a great center for two pawns. Look how inviting that g3 square is for the black knight. This is one of those positions however that without a lot of calculating the right move should instantly be apparent and it isn't Ng3. Consider the position. How valuable is that knight right now? Wouldn't it be apparent that it is easily more valuable than a white rook right now? Both white rooks are doing nothing. No white pieces are doing anything after white's move. The black knight right now is worth far more than the rook. Despite the temptation of the fork I instinctively dismiss it and instead choose Nxd4 without looking more than a very few moves ahead. Fritz very much agrees. Nxd4 is the best move and a distinct advantage rather than Ng3+ forking the rook and king.
454,19,19,1Nxd4,b'rn2k2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3n4/7P/PP4BN/R1BN1K1R w kq -',I admit I was rather proud if such a word should be used to have made the evaluation I made and choose this continuation over the board in a Blitz game as obvious as it might appear to our stronger players here. Material is even now but with this move black's position is far superior to white's. Had I traded the knight for the rook I would have obtained a material plus but no real advantage in my eyes. So when we evaluate a game the dynamics and relative piece-worth of a position really help us decide as we also calculate what's really important because such things affect the actual piece value for what's on the board... or in other words a knight is only worth three points and a rook  five when there are no other considerations. Before this move that black knight was worth more than any white rook and this is why.
455,19,20,Nd7,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3n1B2/7P/PP4BN/R2N1K1R w kq -',White attempts to protect his pawns. Right now the only counterplay he has is a pawn push on the queenside which he does do in a bit. I have the luxury of nothing urgent to deal with so continue with developing my other knight threatening e5 and c5. The black knight has done it's work fracturing white's plans to pieces. In this position the white rooks remain worthless for a long time. With care I think black should already have a won game.
456,19,21,1Nf3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpP3/3n1B2/5N1P/PP4B1/R2N1K1R b kq -',The best move for white but now black begins to gain an advantage that won't be relinquished. That white knight - in my eyes - is worth more than the white rooks. And it could give white counterplay. So I take it off the board.
457,19,22,Bxe5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p1p/2p1p1p1/2Ppb3/5B2/5B1P/PP6/R2N1K1R w kq -',Despite how useful that black dark-squared bishop is with so many black pawns on the board I want the flexibility of the black knight  for it's ability to both attack and defend my pieces. So I take with the Bishop. Fritz also agreed with Bxe5 although taking with the knight was it's second choice.
458,19,23,Nxe5,b'r3k2r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/2Ppn3/8/5B1P/PP6/R2N1K1R w kq -',White could resign here but my opponent never quits until it really is hopeless. So the game goes on another 30 moves.
459,19,24,Nd3,b'r3k2r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/2Pp4/8/3n1B1P/PP4K1/R2N3R w kq -',I am trying to get out of the way of my own pawns. I have no grandiose ideas of winning the b pawn or anything else here. And I don't retreat the knight behind the pawns. I want to maintain some tactical threats down here if I can just to hinder white while I push those central pawns.
460,19,25,2b4,b'r3k2r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/2Pp4/1P6/3n1B1P/P5K1/R2N3R b kq b3',A clever move. The b pawn is immune to the black knight because of the white rook incursion that could soon follow.  I don't want to take that pawn and possibly the a pawn in exchange for losing my own b pawn and allowing white counterplay. Note that black still has not castled and using a tempo to do so with a white incursion going on would not be ideal! In this game I never castle; there are not enough threats on the board to warrant the usual protecting the king and soon those central pawns will become a major headache supported by the black king. SO it is I who will restrict white and push him until his back is against the wall!
461,19,26,2Rb8,b'1r2k2r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/2Pp4/1P6/3n1B1P/P5K1/R2N3R w k -',Now the threat to the white b pawn is very real.
462,19,27,2Rb1,b'1r2k2r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/2Pp4/1P6/3n1B1P/P5K1/1R1N3R b k -',And now it's not so real. ;)  I decide to ignore white's attempts for counterplay as much as I can and continue now with the obvious black plan: the central pawn push.
463,19,28,2Nf2,b'1r2k2r/pp3p1p/2p3p1/2Ppp3/1P6/3n1B1P/P4NK1/1R5R b k -',White cannot tolerate the black night. I view the rooks as impotent and readily agree: I can't tolerate the white knight! I'd rather take away that defender from hindering the black pawn push than try to save the black knight. Besides this way I keep a far greater 'tempo' or initiative going. Although the white bishop has greater scope there are so many black pawns on the board that the bishop with careful play will remain ineffective blocked at nearly every turn when things matter.
464,19,29,2Bg4,b'1r2k2r/pp3p1p/2p3p1/2Pp4/1P2p1B1/7P/P4K2/1R5R b k -',As an aside this was done intentionally by my opponent but really just wastes time. I plan on f5 anyways so this out of character move of my opponent was a little perplexing.
465,19,30,2Be2,b'1r2k2r/pp5p/2p3p1/2Pp1p2/1P2p3/7P/P3BK2/1R5R b k -',This is where the white bishop belonged for any attempt at counter play on the queenside. But the valuable waste of the tempo by Bg4 just makes it harder to stop the pawns no matter what path white chooses.
466,19,31,2Ke7,b'1r5r/pp2k2p/2p3p1/2Pp1p2/1P2p3/7P/P3BK2/1R5R w - -',Although not one of the top two Fritz choices in the game this move really blunts queenside counter play and the king march behind the pawns proves too powerful for white to effectively stop. This is something that pays dividends too far ahead for Fritz to see clearly an endgame weakness of computers. Well programs are getting better all the time of course...
467,19,32,2a5,b'1r5r/pp5p/2p1k1p1/P1Pp1p2/1P2p3/7P/4BK2/1R5R b - -',Here my opponent chooses a move I would not have. I have no interest in opening the queenside and so his effort now to create a position where I need not worry about the queenside just suits me fine. Well he didn't want to have to worry about it either because of the obvious tactics that would occur because of the lack of white king protection.
468,19,33,2Ke5,b'1r5r/pp5p/2p3p1/P1Ppkp2/1P2p3/7P/4BK2/1R5R w - -',White really should resign. In fact I start playing very lazily because I know it's won for black. As such I don't choose the best winning moves and the game drags on another 20 moves.
469,19,34,f3,b'1r5r/pp5p/2p4P/P1Ppk1p1/1P2p3/5p2/4BK2/1R5R w - -',I rather was not thinking for a bit here. Before the f3 push it might have been better to reposition the rooks. White can try Bxf3 according to Fritz but is still lost.
470,19,35,Rhg8,b'1r4r1/pp5p/2p4P/P1Ppk1p1/1P2p3/5p2/5K2/1R3B1R w - -',Protecting the last important piece of the puzzle: the g pawn.

472,19,37,3Bh3,b'1r4r1/1p5p/p1p4P/P1Ppk1pR/1P2p3/5p1B/5K2/1R6 b - -',Here I did think a little. I knew what white was looking at. I decided I didn't care. I would let the g pawn fall to take a rook off the board and let him see if he could do anything with his h pawn. This was not the most accurate play by me but I had made my decision; I thought that white would not have time to do much... and I am proven right.
473,19,38,3Rg1,b'5rr1/1p5p/p1p4P/P1Ppk1pR/1P2p3/5p1B/5K2/6R1 b - -',The obvious. I was tired of this game now; I could have put my king on f6 maybe eventually g6 depending but I knew how well my opponent could fight back. I just wanted to get pieces off the board.
474,19,39,3Kd4,b'5rr1/1p5p/p1p4P/P1Pp2pR/1P1kp3/5p1B/5K2/6R1 w - -',Gauging my opponent's intentions. Had he checked me I would probably have retreated and chose a different plan. But once he had decided on his own efforts he pursued his original course of action.
475,19,40,3Rxg5,b'5r2/1p5p/p1p4P/P1Pp2R1/1P1kp3/5p1B/5K2/8 b - -',Repositioning the rook or an immediate e3 were best now for black.
476,19,41,3Kc4,b'5r2/1p5p/p1p4P/P1Pp2R1/1Pk1p3/5p1B/5K2/8 w - -',This is a bit of a blunder allowing white the opportunity to play Rf5. With the rooks off the black h pawn would fall and the white h pawn would be a real threat. I really should have played better here. This was probably the last real white opportunity. 
477,19,42,3Rg7,b'5r2/1p4Rp/p1p4P/P1Pp4/1Pk1p3/5p1B/5K2/8 b - -',Instead of Rf5 white chooses the obvious but incorrect Rg7.
478,19,43,3Kxb4,b'5r2/1p4Rp/p1p4P/P1Pp4/1k2p3/5p1B/5K2/8 w - -',This is what a beginning chess player would do: grab pawns instead of forcing the advantage home. What not to do! No excuse; I shut down my brain for a few moves until I decided I needed to pay attention.
479,19,44,d4,b'5r2/7R/p1p4P/P1k5/3pp3/5p1B/5K2/8 w - -',So I decided I better start playing seriously again. Never should have allowed that h pawn to even think of queening.
480,19,45,4Rg7,b'5r2/6R1/p1p4P/P1k5/3pp3/5p1B/5K2/8 b - -',Not the most correct move. The white pawn just won't be able to take those final two steps.
481,19,46,4e3+,b'5r2/6R1/p1p4P/P1k5/3p4/4pp1B/5K2/8 w - -',e3! Well no exclamation necessary. They need to invent a new notation for chess moves that are just obvious. White must be careful now not to misstep into a mate. Even though that will be unavoidable eventually.
482,19,47,4Kf1,b'5r2/6R1/p1p4P/P1k5/3p4/4pp1B/8/5K2 b - -',Oops. The evaluation now is more than -+26. Better was Ke1 or Kg1. Worst was Kg3. I choose the strongest continuation...
483,19,48,4d3,b'5r2/6R1/p1p4P/P1k5/8/3ppp1B/8/5K2 w - -',Now here we have the pawn steamroller ready to crush anything in it's path... including a white king. Again a comment. Material is 'even' supposedly. But anyone here I think would choose those three pawns over that one white bishop. And even in the midst of the tactics-filled middlegame such opportunities exist in the imbalance of a position to have a piece or pieces become worth much more than usual. Here it's obvious: those pawns might become queens. In the middle game not so obvious but watch for opportunities to pass up or give up the exchange for a different kind of winning advantage such as what I chose on move 15 nearly 30 moves ago. Yeah 30 moves ago. Those kind of decisions when we get them right really make a difference.
484,19,49,Kb4,b'5r2/8/p1p4P/P5R1/1k6/3ppp1B/8/5K2 w - -',Avoiding the white bishop threatening the a pawn and positioning for further supporting those central pawns. The best king move in this position. Often finding the best position is not always a matter of calculation (although that is most often a big part of it) as it is in getting the most out of one's piece each move.
485,19,50,4Bf5,b'5r2/8/p1p4P/P4BR1/1k6/3ppp2/8/5K2 b - -',Although I don't see it yet with this white move there is a forced mate now in no more than 15 moves; white is indeed lost.
486,19,51,4d2,b'5r2/8/p1p4P/P4BR1/1k6/4pp2/3p4/5K2 w - -',And this move which Fritz did not choose as any of it's top two moves (well in less than five minutes of number crunching by it to be fair) leads to mate in at least 11 if not sooner. Over the board I've seen the gist of the mate here a couple of moves ago although I have not calculated it out.

I see you all enjoyed my game against Expert X in which Henry got entombed on the kingside.  That is really something!  I'd much rather not be on the receiving end of such a mating attack but it was certainly fascinating and awesome to watch.  Anyhow I do get a huge slice of consolation for my loss - another Expert Draw courtesy of Operation Joblock.  Dave my opponent is a very strong player and his rating was only 25 points shy of Masterdom when we agreed that draw so I was really really chuffed to keep him out!  So how did this happen?  Well let's start with Dave's first move - 1. Nf3 - the Reti Opening named after a GM called Richard Reti who just lurved sticking his knight on that square.  This opening can transpose into a myriad of queen pawn openings or the English Opening."

However there is the possibility of regaining my pawn by taking off his e4 pawn with my knight discovering an attack on e5.  So after 12. Nxe5 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Bxe5 material is even.  However I notice that the pawn is hanging so I decided to open up the h8-e5 line for Fou Lenoir.  I think my knight would be well placed on d6 hitting out at e4 and c4.

This must be prevented.

Not sure there.  According to Gameknot Analysis it was an error-free game.  Neither side had committed so much as an inaccuracy.  Dave however thought that it had given me the chance to sew up the kingside.  He is right on there but can he do something on the queenside?!  We shall see.

Now Dave can trade off Fou Lenoir with my good blessing.  If he does then a black pawn will occupy the d6 square.  If Dave does double rooks on the h file then Henry will help my KR defend my h6 pawn.  This will free up my QR to move wherever he likes.  There seems to be no way of ingress.  The only way Dave can try to make progress is to sac his backward b3 pawn.  However this is very risky and I didn't think that Dave would want to take such a risk.  I had in fact worked out that I would have been able to defend against this sac with my queen rook which would in turn support a passed black pawn.  At this juncture I decided to offer a draw.  I remembered something that Coach Ion had said in my epic draw game against The Master Mater.  ""Bad Bishops make excellent defenders!""  I quoted that line to Dave in the chat after putting in my draw offer and he agreed with me and told me he would accept my offer and that I had given him a good game.  After acknowledging his complements with ""Thanks"" he then accepted my draw offer.  So after incurring losses against IM Albertwall and Expert X it was a great way to end my weekend!"

He played 12. ... c5 then Bc7 a6 and b5 advancing pawns of the Queen's side. But Steinitz had its own idea. The 1st game of this match was played in the similar way and was won by Anderssen. But after this game Steinitz had to revise his approach.

This plan was first used in the 1st game of the match and Steinitz had reasons to be satisfied by opening results. So he uses it again in the 5th game. But this time Anderssen was prepared...

588,23,9,Kxg7,b'r4r2/pp4k1/1bpp3p/n7/5n2/3B1N2/P2Q1PPP/5RK1 w - -',It looks that black could resign here. White has material advantage black king is open to any attack and look at these black pieces which like frightened animals hide in their holes. I think that Anderssen decided at this moment that the game is done. But there was a person who did not agreed with that and this person was Steinitz.
589,23,10,Re2,b'4k3/pQ6/1bp2r1p/3p1N2/2n3P1/8/P3rPKP/5R2 w - -',It looks that white took not the best plan underestimating black's abilities to consolidate its pieces.

597,24,2,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White sets off his Dragon Bishop with the task of controlling the longest diagonal on the board even though he knows that Black is going to play the Caro-Kaan Defence. This is because White aims to use his bishop as a defending piece in the opening and early middlegame and as an attacking piece in the late middlegame and endgame.

622,24,27,1a6,b'1k1rr3/1p1nqp2/p1pbpnp1/3p1b1p/P2P4/1PN1PNP1/1BP1QPBP/3RR1K1 w - -',And now KA-BLAM! The 'Brick Wall' structure has been completed. All of Black's pawns are on light squares forming pawn chains. All of White's pawns are also forming pawn chains and each side is ready for the middlegame and ready for attack. The question is how are you going to attack with a Brick Wall in the way?
623,24,28,1Ng5,b'1k1rr3/1p1nqp2/p1pbpnp1/3p1bNp/P2P4/1PN1P1P1/1BP1QPBP/3RR1K1 b - -',! This move attacks the kingside and also prepares for 16. e4! breaking up the pawn structure. Black has no defence!

631,24,36,2Ref1,b'1k1rr3/1p2q3/pnp1p1p1/5p1p/Pb1P4/1P4P1/1BP1QPBP/3R1RK1 b - -',At least the Rooks are still connected but f1-rook is a little budged in. 
632,24,37,2Qd6,b'1k1rr3/1p6/pnpqp1p1/5p1p/Pb1P4/1P4P1/1BP1QPBP/3R1RK1 w - -',?! Hang on I thought Black wanted to keep the Brick Wall. If Black wants to keep his Brick Wall surely he needs more pieces to support it and definitely his queen! Can you work out what's coming next without looking ahead?
633,24,38,2Qe5,b'1k1rr3/1p6/pnpqp1p1/4Qp1p/Pb1P4/1P4P1/1BP2PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',That's right. Black's queen is now pinned by the opposing queen. As White has double bishops and Black has a mixed army the double bishops will work much more effectively in the endgame and Black's DSB won't be able to defend the pawns on the light squares!!!
634,24,39,2Nd7,b'1k1rr3/1p1n4/p1pqp1p1/4Qp1p/Pb1P4/1P4P1/1BP2PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',? Black attacks the white queen and also stops the rook exchange after 22. ... Qxe5 23. dxe5 Rxd1 24. Rxd1 and that eliminates a lot of pieces. Trouble is this doesn't help with the Queen exchange!
635,24,40,2Qxd6+,b'1k1rr3/1p1n4/p1pQp1p1/5p1p/Pb1P4/1P4P1/1BP2PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',As White doesn't fancy having a Brick Wall he is very much concerned about his d4 pawn as it is the most centralized pawn on the board! 
636,24,41,2Bxd6,b'1k1rr3/1p1n4/p1pbp1p1/5p1p/P2P4/1P4P1/1BP2PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',Forced or else Black loses the Queen and Bishop and possibly the game!

640,24,45,2Nc5,b'1k1rr3/1p6/p1p1p1p1/2nP1p1p/PbP5/1P4P1/1B3PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',?? Very tempting. This move ignores the threat and instead makes a threat of Black's own threatening to take the b3-pawn. This is not very good as Black's Brick Wall will soon be damaged and White could exchange Rooks and he would have a passed pawn and it may queen and checkmate Black!
641,24,46,2dxc6,b'1k1rr3/1p6/p1P1p1p1/2n2p1p/PbP5/1P4P1/1B3PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',If Black does not recapture he loses one pawn. The pawn on c6 is protected by the Bishop on g2. Black is forced to play two worsening moves either 26. ... bxc6?? or the equally disastrous 26. ... Nxb3??

The main thing is that White's pawn will be close to queening and note that the pawn on c6 is defended by the bishop on g2. A row of disastrous moves follow...
643,24,48,2Be5+,b'1k1rr3/1p6/p1P1p1p1/4Bp1p/PbP5/1n4P1/5PBP/3R1RK1 b - -',Instead of immediately taking with the pawn White sends of a check first before taking the pawn again. This enables a strong attacking force for white. This also allows 28. Rb1 skewering knight through bishop where Black has to reply with 28. ... Rd3 weakening his defences. 
644,24,49,2Ka8,b'k2rr3/1p6/p1P1p1p1/4Bp1p/PbP5/1n4P1/5PBP/3R1RK1 w - -',?! If 27. ... Kc8?? then 28. cxb7# would be mate. I prefer 27. ... Ka7! which means that White would not take the b7 pawn with check but instead take it as normal.

The placement of the Knight in front of the c-pawn strikes me as counter-intuitive but if one of the world's earliest experimenters of openings thought this viable I'm not going to argue.  I don't reckon it is an easy line but several master games even up to the present day have gone this route.

To be honest I don't know much about this sort of position either but could see that this loosening of Black's position did not augur well for his future.    Instead of the text 6...dxc4 would have been fine.  If White wanted he could have got the pawn back at once by 7.Qa4.  Also good for Black would have been 6...Be7.  My immediate thought was how to 'get in' Qa4 and Ne5 to win the Knight.  As it doesn't work I carried on more 'normally'.

It develops a piece - on an active square too.  It does explain also the purpose behind Black's previous move: to inhibit c4-c5 which would dislodge the bishop from this posting.  The beginnings of the answer lie in White's reply played without the slightest hesitation.

When they do occur they will very likely be isolated and therefore vulnerable and hard to defend.  But it is not all down side.  For a start Black has two open files to play with which is two more than White has right now.  The other is that those pawns control a heck of a lot of squares upon those adjacent files.  Far more significant is the fact that Black loses his d-pawn and remains a pawn behind.

Black has no plan to exchange pawns (14.gxf4 Bxf4) on account of 15.d6!  His idea is to prize open the g-file for his rooks and you never know the Queen's over-watch upon the h3-square might come in useful as well.

Capablanca used to speak of pawn groupings especially in the endgame as islands.  The fewer the 'islands' the more secure the structure.  Here Black has the maximum - 4 pawn islands; White one fewer with 3.  Dominating them all is the central White mass thrown forward both White's flanks refused and hard for Black to come at.  But we haven't reached the endgame quite yet...

That the file is left open is of little help to Black as he has nowhere he can establish a foothold in White's position.  Having said that though White has to keep an eye on the possibility of the enemy knight coming in via g6 to f4 and forking Q and B.  Speaking of Bishops and Knights the canny reader will have noted that this is a Bishop vs Knight game.  In close games such as this the Knight is usually a match and even more for the Bishop.  Here I regard the pieces as more or less a balance for each other and both are about the handiest pieces available to either side.  Maybe the Knight is slightly the superior minor piece at that.  White's advantages lie altogether elsewhere in particular the stranglehold he has on the centre but also the quicker access he has to the Q-side.

All sorts of attacking moves crossed my mind here (Bf1 Qa3 Qc4 Rc6 Rfc2) but none of them seemed to lead anywhere decisive - and even suggested White might end up forgoing some of his edge.

Possibly Black ought to have challenged White's tenure of the c-file because that is about to become absolute.
