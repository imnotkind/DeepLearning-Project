My goal is to gain advantage over the d4 square with the sacrifice of white aggressive development. Also I don't tend to like to play copycat game (1. e4 e5 ...) but rather pick my own style of play.
145,6,1,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Goal one accomplish. I gain center pawn at sacrifice of allowing white to develop and open the king bishop line.

147,6,3,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I block one bishop to open the other and add protection to the e pawn.
148,6,4,Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/5ppp/p1np1b2/1p1Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This is typical of how I play this. The rapid development on black side is a side effect of white having to move the knights multiple times early.

157,7,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Like so many I was an avid chess player in high school and college but gave it up entirely until later in life. In my younger days I played 1. e4 exclusively. Back then I had time to keep track of the myriad defenses that Black can use. At this stage of life its just not worth the effort. It is true that there are a lot of defenses to 1. d4 but the positions tend to be more similar and morph into one another more easily than the 1. e4 games.
158,7,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I have had more trouble with 3. ... d5 which usually leads to a more unbalanced position than the King's Indian. I have not faced the Grunfeld enough to feel confident yet that I know how to deal with it. In the handful of Grunfelds I have played as White my most smashing success was with the wild and crazy 4. g4 but this was only because my shocked opponent blundered almost immediately.
159,7,2,f3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',My first attempt with the Saemisch. This move never made much sense to me; White neglects development to make yet another pawn move and takes away the most logical square for his King's Knight. Initially I tried the seemingly more natural 5. Nf3 against the K's Indian but I was not satisfied with the resultant positions. Black seems able to complete his development unproblematically and eventually play ... e5 or ...c5 chipping away at White's pawn center and thus achieve the main goal of the K's Indian. So for a while I switched to 5. f4 which got better results but only through luck in my opinion. 5. f3 supports the center better than 5. f4 and while it is not a developing move it aims at hindering Black's natural development by taking away the g4 square from the King's Knight (should White decide to play Be3) or the Queen's Bishop (should White decide to play Nf3).
160,7,3,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',This is not the only option of course. The database I use gives ... e5 as the most played move here followed by the text ... Nbd7 and ... c5. I like either ... e5 or ... c5 here as I think Black has to hit White's strong center right away. At least in this game Black did not have the luxury of leisurely development! ... c5 of course can involve a pawn sacrifice but Black's results seem to be good.
161,7,4,Nge2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',The other main possibility is 7. Qd2 but I figured: why commit the Queen just yet? There is only one reasonable square for the Knight so let's move it first and see what Black does.
162,7,5,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',According to the DB the most played move but it seems dreadfully slow to me. I prefer an immediate hit on the center with ... e5. If White responds 8. d5 then after ... Na5 9. Ng3 (or Nc1) c5 Black has achieved his opening goals.
163,7,6,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',This is an attempt to preserve the KB (If White should play Bh6 Black can retreat to h8 without losing his KR). Yet surely it is way too slow? Black can still play ...e5 here and answer d5 with Na5 as on the previous move. Even ... Rb8 seems preferable. True in this case White can force the exchange of Black squared Bishops but one wonders if this is worth facing the possibility of ... b5.
164,7,7,Na5,b'1rbqr1k1/2p1ppbp/p2p1np1/np5P/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1P1/2KR1B1R w - -',Probably ... Nxh5 was preferable because after the pawn exchange hxg6 fxg6 the e6 square becomes dreadfully weak. After 11 ... Nxh5; 12. g4 Nf6; I was planning 13. Ng3 to be followed with Qh2 and g5. However Kanko vs. Graeffe (Finland 1991) continued 13. Nd5 bxc4; 14. Nxf6+ exf6; 15.Nc3 Na5 16.Qh2 and Black was crushed.

166,7,9,c6,b'1rbqr1k1/4p1bp/p1pp1np1/8/2pPPNP1/2N1BP2/PP1Q4/2KR3R w - -',This is better than 15 ... Nd7?? 16. Ne6! 1-0 as actually occurred in Stake Larsen vs. Sorseth (Gausdal 1999). Nevertheless ... g5 is much better. Black does not seem to understand what trouble he is in.
167,7,10,Qb6,b'1rb1r1k1/4p1bp/pqpp1np1/8/2pPPNP1/2N1BP2/PP5Q/2KR3R w - -',In view of what happens perhaps it would have been better for Black to accept the loss of a piece with 16 ... g5; 17 e5 h6; 18. exf6 exf6; 18 Ng2

171,7,14,Kg8,b'1r4k1/4r1b1/p1ppP3/4pQP1/2p1P2R/5Pq1/PP1R4/2KN4 w - -',This runs into a quick mate. Amazingly my computer tells me that Black can survive to an endgame albeit a piece down via this route: … Ke8 27. Qg6+ Kd8 28. Rh7 Bf8 29. Rxd6+ Kc7 30. Rxe7+ Kxd6 31. Rd7+ Kc5 32. e7 Bxe7 33. Rxe7 Qf4+ 34. Kb1 Rd8 35. Nc3 Rd2 36. Na4+ Kd4 (not ... Kb4 as Black gets mated). I find it hard to believe that there isn't an improvement for White in this line.

There's nothing obviously wrong with Nc6 except that it's never going to help Black fight for the centre in the same way as other moves.  If Black is to play ...e5 or ...d5 in the first few moves he would rather support that pawn with another pawn as if white plays 2.d4 e5 3.dxe5 Nxe5 the knight is potentially vulnerable whereas after 3.d5 the knight is going to have to move anyway.

Black's first move allows White to seize the centre if he's so minded with 2. d4 or control the e5 square with 2.Nf3 or 2.f4.  Given that I didn't offer 1. ...e5 as one of my regular openings would I really want to put myself in a Ruy Lopez or Scotch game position?

White was threatening to play 4.Bxc6 and 5.e5 or just 4.d4.  3. ...d6 self-pins the Nc6 so 3. ...e5 (which takes us back after 4.Nf3 to a Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez) or this move are the obvious candidates.  Black takes advantage of White not having played Nf3 to try to grab the bishop pair without damaging his pawn structure but breaks the rule against moving the same piece twice in the opening.

He'll struggle to whip up a K-side attack although he could try something with Be3(g5) and Qd2 followed by Bh6.  His problem is that without any half open files he cannot easily bring his rooks into the attack.
In those circumstances he has to look at some sort of pawn break made more difficult by the lack of a Black pawn to target.  The most obvious are d3-d4 and f2-f4-f5.  Rb1 suggests that b2-b4 is coming but from Black's point of view so what?"

261,12,26,Ke6,b'r4r2/pp4b1/2ppkn2/4p1Bp/4P3/P1PP1P2/1P4K1/1R3R2 w - -',Black wants to use the half-open f-file and h-file together with the open g-file for his rooks and is quite happy to swap off anything that moves safe in the knowledge that even if White could swap pretty much everything he's still got an extra piece and the bishop is the right colour to queen the a-pawn.
262,12,27,2Rbd1,b'r4r2/pp4b1/2ppkn2/4p1Bp/4P3/P1PP1P2/1P4K1/3R1R2 b - -',White could simply play 26.d4 and then decide whether he wants to put the rook on c1 or d1.
263,12,28,2Bh4,b'5r1r/pp4b1/2ppkn2/4p2p/4P2B/P1PP1P2/1P2K3/3R1R2 b - -',Understandably White wants to slow Black's push down the h-file but Harry wasn't going anywhere just yet - he'd get cut off fairly quickly.  The more important diagonal for White was the c1-h6 one (because of the weaknesses at f4 and e3.  Black takes it immediately. 
264,12,29,3b4,b'5r1r/pp6/2ppkn1b/4p2p/1P2P2B/P1PP1P2/4K3/3R1R2 b - b3',If the plan was b2-b4 rather than d2-d4 what was the point of playing Rbd1?
265,12,30,Rfg8,b'6rr/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1P2Pb1B/P1PP1P2/4K3/3R2R1 w - -',Inviting the exchange of as many rooks as possible.  Black's h-pawn is significantly better than White's backward f-pawn in this position and with hindsight White should have looked at f3-f4 back at move 29 or before.
266,12,31,Rg2+,b'7r/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1P2Pb1B/P1PP1P2/4K1r1/3R3R w - -',I was always taught of the power of a rook on the 7th rank.  Whilst the exchange was not to White's liking he should have kept the rook on g1 as if Black plays Rxg1 Rxg1 still gives White some measure of control over the g-file.  Now White's king is pushed back and Black has a choice of how to mop up the Q-side pawns.
267,12,32,Rc2,b'7r/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1P2Pb1B/P1PP1P2/2r5/3R1K1R w - -',Black can play Ra2 straight-away.  This move gives White a choice - does he want to defend the pawn with Be1 tying his pieces down yet further play c3-c4 and lose his flexibility with the pawns or d3-4 to open up the centre (albeit a long time too late).  I suspect that (d) none of the above would be a preferred option but it's not available.
268,12,33,Ra2,b'7r/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1P2Pb2/P1PP1P2/r7/3RBK1R w - -',White is now hog-tied by the Ra2 and his weak dark squares.  Black has a number of plans including picking up the Q-side pawns mating on g1 pushing the h-pawn invading down the g-file with the other rook etc. 
269,12,34,Rg8,b'6r1/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1PP1Pb2/P2P1P2/r7/3RBK1R w - -',Logical.  Black has no fear of swapping a pair of rooks but otherwise he'll play Rgg2 and dominate the 7th.
270,12,35,3Bf2,b'6r1/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1PP1Pb2/P2P1P2/r4B2/3R1K1R b - -',Stopping Rgg2 for the time being and hitting a7 although Black's not overly concerned about that.  White's main problem at this stage is that he has no squares for his rooks no open file to use no counter-play and no chance.
271,12,36,Ra2+,b'6r1/pp6/2ppkn2/4p2p/1PP1Pb2/3P1P2/r3KB2/3R3R w - -',White's last move turns out to be a waste of time.  The end is swift and quite pretty.

328,15,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black is planning to attack the centre via ...c5 with the support of the bishop on g7. It often works well but can on occasion give white a huge centre. Notice how my pawns give me a plus of space and central dominance. This is enough to give me a small but enduring advantage.

The alternative ...0-0 has not scored as well for black in practice. Probably because it gives white time to consolidate in the centre. So if black does want to fight for a win then ...c5 is his only option.  
331,15,4,Rb1,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/1RBQKB1R b Kkq -',White has a wide range of choices here but I like Rb1 because rooks belong on open files and hitting at b7 hinders the development of black's LSB and thus his queen side.

335,15,8,1Bxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/6p1/2pPb3/4P3/2P5/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R w K -',The exchange is good for white as the bishop is vulnerable to f4 and white's centre is almost god like. This guarantees a space advantage.

I plan to give Harpov control of the queen side in exchange for greater development and freedom on the king side. On the other hand black has managed to create significant weakness on the dark squares. His developed bishop is far superior. So white's big centre is balanced by black's big bishop and dark square control.

This is enough to give white a clear advantage.

""Kann That Caro

I feel I'd be a happier man...if I could play the Caro-Kann.
But as it seems to me...when I play pawn to 'Qb3'
White gets a Knight upon 'K5'...and then as sure as I'm alive
My Rook file's opened and my Queen...exposed to dangers unforeseen
By Nimzowitsch and all that lot...who think the Caro rather hot.

Then if I reach the middle game...my play is lifeless cold and tame.
White's game is logical and bright...while nothing I can do is right.
I grow so tired of 'Check' 'Check' 'Check'...that I become a nervous wreck
And get into a hopeless pin allowing white an easy win.
Tell Nimzowitsch it's all a plant. The opening's really Caro-Can't!""

578,24,3,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pp3/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White would attack my central chaing pretty advanced at the cost of piece developement.

Called the Reti opening in honor of chess player Richard Reti.
Usually the plan is that whatever your opponent does you push the g pawn fianchetto the light square bishop then castle. In this way your king is well protected from the beginning.
It is considered defensive and not much used at top level.

633,26,10,Nxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2Nb4/3p4/3Pp3/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',That's it let's take the knight. OK mine moved three times and his only one but...
634,26,11,bxc6,b'r1bqk1nr/p1p2ppp/2pb4/3p4/3Pp3/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He has to alter his pawn structure to recapture. So in terms of imbalances so far I lost some tempos and he has an altered pawn structure.
635,26,12,c4,b'r1bqk1nr/p1p2ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPp3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',OK now let's advance the c pawn to go to c5 if he captures he will have a very bad pawn structure (three pawns on the same file that can be good in some situations but here I'm not too sure) plus I can take the e pawn with the bishop.
636,26,13,Be6,b'r2qk1nr/p1p2ppp/2pbb3/3p4/2PPp3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',OK he doesn't take and develops his bishop defending the d pawn.
637,26,14,c5,b'r2qk1nr/p1p2ppp/2pbb3/2Pp4/3Pp3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So let's advance inside his side too and attack his other bishop at the same time!
638,26,15,Be7,b'r2qk1nr/p1p1bppp/2p1b3/2Pp4/3Pp3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He has to retreat.

640,26,17,Qd7,b'r3k1nr/p1pqbppp/2p1b3/2Pp4/Q2Pp3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',He choses to defend with the queen.

If he takes I recapture with the e pawn creating a semi open e file for a future rook.
Otherwise I just take with the f pawn creating a semi open f file for a future rook."

643,26,20,1Bg5,b'r3k2r/p1pqbppp/2p1bn2/2Pp2B1/Q2Pp3/5PP1/PP2P1BP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',I think it's worth sacrificing the bishop to kill the knight. He's defending d5 and e4 and he's well positioned if black decides to castle kingside.
644,26,21,1O-O,b'r4rk1/p1pqbppp/2p1bn2/2Pp2B1/Q2Pp3/5PP1/PP2P1BP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Well black just castles kingside.

646,26,23,1Bxf6,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p1bb2/2Pp4/Q2Pp3/5PP1/PP2P1BP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Wisely he recaptures with his bishop and not with the g pawn.
647,26,24,1fxe4,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p1bb2/2Pp4/Q2PP3/6P1/PP2P1BP/RN2K2R b KQ -',Now I can go with the initial idea and take the e pawn. 
648,26,25,1dxe4,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p1bb2/2P5/Q2Pp3/6P1/PP2P1BP/RN2K2R w KQ -',He recaptures and I will be able to take with the bishop. But wait! Now he has two attackers targeting my d pawn who is only protected by my queen! If he takes the d pawn he will furthermore take the c pawn and destroy my center.
649,26,26,1e3,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p1bb2/2P5/Q2Pp3/4P1P1/PP4BP/RN2K2R b KQ -',I prefer to build a solid diagonal spine of three pawns. The e pawn is not defended but it's not threatened so far.
650,26,27,1Bd5,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p2b2/2Pb4/Q2Pp3/4P1P1/PP4BP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Of course he defends the e4 pawn and now he also has a strong diagonal spine with the bishop defending both extreme pawns.
651,26,28,1Nc3,b'r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/2p2b2/2Pb4/Q2Pp3/2N1P1P1/PP4BP/R3K2R b KQ -',His e pawn is still here invading my side. My turn to develop a second piece threatening him.

At this point my impression is that the game is a bit stuck. The opening is over we're in the midgame. Someone has to take the initiative."

On the other hand my queen is a bit isolated on the a4 square I should think of a way to put her back in the game... maybe Qd1?
Trading my knight against his bishop is tempting but the drawback is that it would reorganize his pawn structure."
654,26,31,1Qg4,b'r4rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2b2/2Pb4/Q2Pp1qP/2N1P1P1/PP4B1/R3K2R w KQ -',Damn the black queen has taken advantage of the previous move. She threatens the g pawn now. Too late to bring back the white queen.

On the other hand I notice that his queen is a bit constrained can we trap her somehow? If Bh3 her only free squares are h5 and g6. How to control them?
657,26,34,1Kf2,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/2p2b2/p1Pb4/Q2Pp1qP/4P1P1/PP2NKB1/R6R b - -',Commiting move as I cannot castle anymore. The idea is that now it is the king who will protect g3 so I can bring the knight to f4 and control g6 and h5!

663,26,40,2Nf4,b'1r4k1/2p2ppp/2p2b2/p1Pb4/1r1PpNqP/1P2P1P1/P1Q2KB1/R6R b - -',OK knight moved to b4 good. But... the super plan doesn't work! If Bh3 then Qf3+.

One can see that if the b8 rook ever leaves its rank I may be able to backrank-checkmate him.

667,26,44,2Bxe4,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/2p2b1p/2Pb4/pr1PBNqP/1P2P1P1/P1Q2K2/RR6 b - -',This move attacks the h7 square blocking the king's exit... At the same time there is still a b-plan to trap the queen with Bf5! It didn't work from the front let's try from the back (sentence not to take out of context).
668,26,45,2axb3,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/2p2b1p/2Pb4/1r1PBNqP/1p2P1P1/P1Q2K2/RR6 w - -',OK he takes the b3 pawn. He could have taken the bishop as well.
669,26,46,2axb3,b'1r4k1/2p2pp1/2p2b1p/2Pb4/1r1PBNqP/1P2P1P1/2Q2K2/RR6 b - -',I recapture the a file is now open! Ready to sacrifice the queen for a backrank mate.

709,28,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Surprising move number one of the Budapest. Instead of retaking black poses white a little dilemma. 
710,28,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White chooses the so-called wisest answer: ignore the pawn and develop. 
711,28,4,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the Icelandic. Black instead of retake the pawn sacrifices one instead for a quick developement. 
712,28,5,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White doesn't take the bite. Here a lot of little tactics can be performed by white starting with Bb5+ and after black blocks the check dxe6 forces black to open the f column.

I considered here Qa5 to be a good move. 

Some lines I explored:

9.	...		Qa5. If white goes

11.	QxBd2	Qd2+ and here white must think about how to retake since
12.	Nxd2		Kd7 and black has compensation for the pawn and is about to press hard on white's N and Pawn. On the other side if
12.	Kxd2 trying to save a tempo for castling 
12.			Ne4+ forcing white to defend f2 with the king and threatening c5.  
Again after Kd7 and a6 black's asset improves drastically. For example:
13.	Ke3		Kd7
14.	b4		a6
15.	Nd4		Nc6 etc with a decent game. 

Or:
9.	...		Qa5
10.	Nd4!		Kd7 with a lot of ways for white to proceed. 

Other possible black moves are:

Qe7 (10. Qb5+ Qd7...)
Nc6
d4!? (10. Ne4 looks good because it defends c5 and if... 10. ... NxN 11. QxN and black is free to play Bxc5 since after 12. Qxb7? Bd4 13. Qb5+ Nd7 14. Ne5? Qe7..."

Black's idea is to enter an endgame in which he is supposedly better thanks to white's weakened pawn structure but he oversees that the bishop's pair is more than enough as a compensation. The natural alternative was 18. ... Rad8 19. Qe2 c4 20. d4 Nc6 21. dxe5 Nxe5 22. Nd4 Bd6 and black can build a very strong kingside attack.

He CAN actually go on with Nf6 but he has to handle developement very well to equalize and often castle queenside. All this is avoided with the text move.

Since I plan to castle queenside and attack black's kinside (it's my principal plan when playing white) I dont' want to play b3. Now if black takes I'll take back with the knight since I don't want to move my c3 pawn at all or a strong attack will come over me starting with Bb4+. I'll take with the knight and if Nc6 or d6 is played... well I'll see I can afford this.
