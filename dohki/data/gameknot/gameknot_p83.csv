0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So white kicks things off with the Queen's Pawn Opening.
1,0,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Standard.
2,0,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Now I had expected white to attempt the QG with 1.c4 but this is ok.  I mean it develops but the other move was a little better only because it's studied more by masters and GM's.  Afterall Mr. Stockel told me that it is a good idea to play moves that masters and GM's analyze and the realjimfrior the current mentor for chicoboy and me agrees with this assessment.  He said ""that's how you learn best"" in my game against him."
3,0,3,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',?! I do not know why black played this but better was to bring out one of his N's  or develop a central pawn.  This however is not a developing move and it does not help him to control the center. 
4,0,4,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Now this is a very interesting position.  Should black allow this everything will transpose into a QG.  Of course however that is not going to happen.
5,0,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"But it does however appear that the position has transposed into the Benoni Defense.  That's because white's position is the same but in a completely different sequence and the same could be said about black's position.
"
6,0,6,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',!! At this point white decides to chase black's N in order to kick it and gain tempo.  BTW there is absolutely nothing wrong with this move.  At first It thought that 4.Nf3 or 4.Bd3 was better for development and that is what I would have played if I were white.  But as we will see later on this is the best move in this position.  And it will eventually cause problems for black.  I'm sure that white kept this in mind before he played this.  
7,0,7,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/7p/3pP3/3Pn3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',In this position white wants to exchange and he is going to succeed in doing so.  Note: This is a version of the Exchange Variation at least in my opinion.  I'm not sure but I think that an exchange variation occurs whenever there is an even exchange of material.
8,0,8,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/7p/4P3/3Pp3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',If I were white 6.Nf3?? would have come into consideration.  However I would not have played that on the grounds of 6...exf3 7.gxf3 losing a piece for a pawn.  So I would I even look at a bad move.  Well in chess one should always be thinking about a way to develop.  That's because it's a good idea to develop all of your pieces early in the game until your left with a Q and both R's.
9,0,9,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4p2p/4P3/3P4/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Although black moved here to develop he should have waited and brought his LSB out first.  Why?  This move will only give him one place to develop his bishop.  And he cannot do it without cramming it.  Now this is what Jack Stockel meant when he told me not to cram your pieces.  That's because it might take him two moves instead of one to get a piece out.  Either way however in order for lesplay to complete development black would have to spend more moves then normal to get his pieces out and that is why 4.e5!!.  Had that not been played I am sure that black would be almost completely developed.  This also shows why it is a good to get things out ASAP and not procrastinate on developing.  With that in mind white now has a noticeable advantage because he is more developed and much closer to controlling the center.  In fact chicoboy's center is almost completely controlled in my opinion because of where his central pawns are positioned.
10,0,10,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4p2p/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',! This is another strong move by white.
11,0,11,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?! I understand that black wanted to kick whites LSB.  But being obsessed with attacking pieces can cause problems.  Although it does force white to retreat his bishop I believe that this move is a waste of time for black because lesplay could have used it to develop.  As cdeburca once told me don't just kick pieces for the thrill of it.  So better was 8...Bd7 or 8...Nd7.  
12,0,12,Qa5+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/B2P4/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? This move is actually his first mistake and not just an inaccuracy.  The real reason is that one should develop his or her minor pieces before bringing out the major pieces.  In fact the Q should be the last thing that emerges.  So in my opinion best was 9...Nd7.  If not he also had the option of developing his DSB or LSB.  Now if white finds the right move black will be in a lot of trouble.
13,0,13,1c3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Ok this is a way for white to get out of check.  But best was 10.Bd7! hitting the Q.  That was actually the move that would have gotten black into trouble.  Although I mentioned that you don't just want to kick material for the thrill of it there is way more to this then meets the eye.  What am I talking about?  First 10.Bd7 develops another piece.  Second lesplay is then to retreat his Queen.  Third after he gets the Q out of harm's way white gets to castle and castling is another way to develop.  So basically white gets to make two developing moves while black just wastes time bringing his major piece out instead of developing.  Having said that I would have played 10.Bd7 followed by 11.0-0 if I were white.  
14,0,14,1Be7,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',At least black has a chance to catch up on development.
15,0,15,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',In response white decides to castle.
16,0,16,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',But so does black.
17,0,17,1b4,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/q3P3/BP1P4/2P2N2/P5PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - b3',I understand that chicoboy wanted to get black's Q out of there but better was to develop the DSB.  However I think that white is playing extremely well.  
18,0,18,1a3,b'rnb2rk1/pp2bpp1/1qp1p2p/4P3/BP1P4/P1P2N2/6PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I do not know why white played this.  It might have been to connect the pawns but that is more useful during endgames.  
19,0,19,1a6,b'rnb2rk1/1p2bpp1/pqp1p2p/4P3/BP1P4/P1P2N2/6PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',And I also do not know why black this.  Instead lesplay should have developed his b8 N or LSB.
20,0,20,1Be3,b'rnb2rk1/1p2bpp1/pqp1p2p/4P3/BP1P4/P1P1BN2/6PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',! Ok this is a solid move.  Afterall this is chicoboy's last minor piece.  After the Q comes out white is completely developed.
21,0,21,1Qd8,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bpp1/p1p1p2p/4P3/BP1P4/P1P1BN2/6PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Why did black move his Q back?  Afterall it is not attacked and lesplay could have used this move to develop.
22,0,22,1Ra2,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2bpp1/p1p1p2p/4P3/BP1P4/P1P1BN2/R5PP/3Q1RK1 b - -',Not a bad move but if I were white I would have brought the Q out.  That's because it completes development and connects the rooks.
23,0,23,1b5,b'rnbq1rk1/4bpp1/p1p1p2p/1p2P3/BP1P4/P1P1BN2/R5PP/3Q1RK1 w - b6',So black now decides to attack white's LSB.  This is now a very interesting position for both sides.
24,0,24,Bb7,b'rn1q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1p1p2p/1p2P3/1P1P4/P1P1BN2/R1B3PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',! Guess what?  Despite what myevilluck told me I like to fianchetto my pieces.  In fact Mr. Stockel told me that it's generally a good idea to put your bishop on the longest square.  To me this is one of black's best moves because it's a good way to develop a piece.  Now the question is will he develop the N?  That is to be seen.  
25,0,25,1Qd3,b'rn1q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1p1p2p/1p2P3/1P1P4/P1PQBN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 b - -',At last chicoboy developed his final piece.  Now that all is said and done white is now completely developed.  Not only that but coincidentally he is threatening mate in one.
26,0,26,1f5,b'rn1q1rk1/1b2b1p1/p1p1p2p/1p2Pp2/1P1P4/P1PQBN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 w - f6',In this case that was a good move from black.  But ...g6 was best as it also prevents the threat.  In addition he would still have an opportunity to get his b8 N out.  With this move however black loses his opportunity to develop anything else at once.  This is another reason why lesplay should have completed his development when he had the chance.
27,0,27,1exf6e.p.,b'rn1q1rk1/1b2b1p1/p1p1pP1p/1p6/1P1P4/P1PQBN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 b - -',So now we get into an exchange variation.  Like I said before black cannot develop his N or he will lose a B for a P because of 19.PXB QXP.
28,0,28,1Rxf6,b'rn1q2k1/1b2b1p1/p1p1pr1p/1p6/1P1P4/P1PQBN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 w - -',?? Although lesplay prevents white from winning a pawn this move instantly loses.  Although white was already winning this capture will immediately lead to black's downfall.  The reason being is that chicoboy now has an inevitable mating sequence against black.
29,0,29,1Qh7+,b'rn1q2k1/1b2b1pQ/p1p1pr1p/1p6/1P1P4/P1P1BN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 b - -',So white starts by placing black in check.
30,0,30,1Kf7,b'rn1q4/1b2bkpQ/p1p1pr1p/1p6/1P1P4/P1P1BN2/R1B3PP/5RK1 w - -',Also feasible was 19...Kf8 but then 20.Kh8 Kf7 (forced) 20.Ne5#.  Either way mate is unavoidable as I mentioned earlier.  This move however delays the inevitable.
31,0,31,2Ne5+,b'rn1q4/1b2bkpQ/p1p1pr1p/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1P1B3/R1B3PP/5RK1 b - -',After black get's out white places lesplay back in check.
32,0,32,2Ke8,b'rn1qk3/1b2b1pQ/p1p1pr1p/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1P1B3/R1B3PP/5RK1 w - -',Black also could have played 20...Kf8 but then 21.Qh8#.  So this move delays mate for a move.
33,0,33,2Bg6+,b'rn1qk3/1b2b1pQ/p1p1prBp/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1P1B3/R5PP/5RK1 b - -',However after this check it will no longer be feasible for black to delay mate.
34,0,34,2Rxg6,b'rn1qk3/1b2b1pQ/p1p1p1rp/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1P1B3/R5PP/5RK1 w - -',Although white will mate with 22.Qxg6#.  Guess what?  If black had played 21...Kf8 instead then 22.Qh8#.  So chicoboy gets to mate in one no matter what his opponent plays.
35,0,35,2Qxg6#,b'rn1qk3/1b2b1p1/p1p1p1Qp/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1P1B3/R5PP/5RK1 b - -',"In this particular game black went wrong because he did not develop all of his pieces or control the center.  But white managed to do all of the above.  Here's the thing out of all three steps black followed through one of them while white completed all of the tasks and then some.  According to schakertjie in the opening your main goals should be to ""1 control the center 2 develop develop develop 3 get the king to safety.""  I strongly agree with this assessment and that is also the moral of this story."

There's only so many chess moves in the opening one can do after all that don't give the game away.

83,2,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Fritz liked Nd7 better and an eventual fianchetto of black's light-squared bishop. This should be considered an inaccuracy by black that might have implications later in the game.
84,2,8,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',So I choose the best reply here. D4.
85,2,9,Bd7,b'r2qk1nr/pppb1ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Again Fritz preferred another move Nf6. Seems black has been a bit lulled by my odd play earlier in the opening and does not have a plan as a result. To be honest nor do I at this point. The game is going to end up just looking at the pieces as an open game; and it's hard to have a plan without seeing how the pawn structure will end up. Notice however that black does have structure to his pawns; hence Fritz's disagreements earlier to black's moves. I however am still not sure at all what to do so my plans will wait until I can see something more clearly. That's what I like most about chess; the ability to create plans from a position where none may be apparent to those of us who enjoy chess more as a hobby.
86,2,10,a3,b'r2qk1nr/pppb1ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I choose a waiting move. Fritz preferred a bishop move by me here but I'm not so sure where my bishops should go yet. Some may say it's a wasted move but I am also preparing a future b4 here as my play will be on the queenside most likely. Oh that's the other problem with being out of book; known openings have known strategies while only at move 6 as here in this game. Now this a pawn move by me is easily countered by black with say a5 if he were to choose to do that. The game is pretty equal here and although I like black's pawns I don't like his piece position so much.
87,2,11,Nf6,b'r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2nbpn2/8/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Fritz did not like this move either preferring to add tension to the center with e5 and open up the board for his bishops which pieces could suddenly be much better by so doing. Black however wishes to get his king to safety hence the night move.
88,2,12,Bg5,b'r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2nbpn2/6B1/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Now here Fritz wanted me to move Be2 or my other knight out. This move wastes a tempo but after black's response I'll have a better idea of what I should plan... i.e. will he move h6 or move the bishop? Since it pretty much does waste a move Fritz is not too impressed with this move giving black a small advantage.
89,2,13,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',And Fritz thinks this is not the best reply. H6 or castling was Fritz' choice here but the game is still basically equal slight advantage now for white.
90,2,14,Bd3,b'r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I choose the best continuation here according to Fritz. Black's pieces look very symmetrical although not sure that e pawn should be sitting on e6 for long.
91,2,15,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Black chooses to castle....
92,2,16,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',And I also castle; again the best response according to Fritz at this point.
93,2,17,Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3n2B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',And Black makes the natural looking move Nd5 a top pick of Fritz.
94,2,18,1Bd2,b'r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P4/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Fritz seemed to like trading the bishops off but I'm not quite ready to do that. So I go ahead and retreat to d2; white still has a small advantage. I like however at this point my potential mobility better than black's.
95,2,19,1f5,b'r2q1rk1/pppbb1pp/2n1p3/3n1p2/3P4/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - f6',Black chooses the aggressive f5 but I don't think this is good; black's king defense is weakened and the white bishop remains very passive. It's not clear where the black knights should go - d5 won't be an outpost for too long and a knight on g4 is easily chased away. And although it's early in the game black is beginning to look uncoordinated to me.
96,2,20,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/pppbb1pp/2n1p3/3n1p2/2PP4/P2B1N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - c3',I am beginning to formulate a plan. I am going to want to have my knight on c3 but I don't want black to have the option of trading those pieces off when I think I am better positioned for mobility. Since I am planning now on a queenside push while positioning a second threat at the kingside this move to me is a better fit. It was also Fritz's second choice. Silly Fritz. ;)
97,2,21,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P2B1N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Nb6 or Nf6; black chooses Nf6. Meanwhile I am beginning to like my position.
98,2,22,1Nc3,b'r2q1rk1/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Well Fritz preferred a queen or rook move here considering this an inaccuracy. But I am exercising my plan and it called for this knight move. So far 25 moves in neither side has made a major strategical or tactical mistake unless you call my strange moves to start the game such. ;) I believe and Fritz agrees that white has a slight edge.
99,2,23,1Kh8,b'r2q1r1k/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is a prophylactic move by black to get his king off the a2-g8 diagonal. Fritz doesn't like it at all. But I can see why black wanted to make this move now. There is a continuation to remove one of my bishops for a knight here but black chose not to try it. After some thought...
100,2,24,1Kh1,b'r2q1r1k/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',I do the same for similar reasons. And Fritz thinks there are better ones. But it's the kind of move that saves a position down the road often enough. White is retaining an edge still.
101,2,25,1Rg8,b'r2q2rk/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',THIS move I did not like by black. In order to pull off what he seems to be trying to do he's gunna need to push that g pawn and that will leave his king rather vulnerable. Although he has his forces mostly positioned to help things over there they don't have all that much room to maneuver. Fritz agrees; this is not a good move for black.From this point on I think white slowly gains the clear upper hand.
102,2,26,1b4,b'r2q2rk/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/1PPP4/P1NB1N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - b3',Fritz preferred d5 or Qc2; but I'm interested in pushing that queenside. Moving one of those other two could result in winning a pawn according to Fritz and the pressure on black's king would go up especially with the white light-squared bishop getting to a2-g8 diagonal. But this is not a bad move either.
103,2,27,1Qf8,b'r4qrk/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/5p2/1PPP4/P1NB1N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Fritz is really disliking black's strategy now giving a plus to white of about 1 1/2. Bottling that one rook up is a bad idea in general too.
104,2,28,1b5,b'r4qrk/pppbb1pp/2n1pn2/1P3p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',I choose the best move: b5.
105,2,29,1Nd8,b'r2n1qrk/pppbb1pp/4pn2/1P3p2/2PP4/P1NB1N2/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Black chooses the lesser of two evils. Now yes I am hanging the a pawn but black won't have time to make that a game-changer!
106,2,30,1Ne5,b'r2n1qrk/pppbb1pp/4pn2/1P2Np2/2PP4/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Fritz likes c5 or a4 here. This move however allows me if I choose to cause black to either give up the bishop pair or for at least a few more moves remain even more cramped. When I play I do not always play for an immediate advantage or tactical edge. I often look at what I am trying to accomplish and then position to make that a reality; if my plan is the better plan of the two then normally things go well!
107,2,31,1c6,b'r2n1qrk/pp1bb1pp/2p1pn2/1P2Np2/2PP4/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Fritz liked c5 better.
108,2,32,1Nxd7,b'r2n1qrk/pp1Nb1pp/2p1pn2/1P3p2/2PP4/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Well Fritz didn't like this but now black does not have the bishop pair. Black is so oddly positioned that I could have done a couple other things; allowed Nf7 and played Re1 after which the e pawn would have become a target is one such thing. However I felt that I needn't fight just for that one pawn and thought that later in the game black's not having the bishop pair would put him in difficulties. You can decide that for yourself. While the knight WAS worth more than that bishop just now I did not see a way to make that work to my advantage and that particular advantage would not remain later...
109,2,33,1Nxd7,b'r2n1qrk/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/1P3p2/2PP4/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',The obvious reply.
110,2,34,1d5,b'r2n1qrk/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/1P1P1p2/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Fritz still dislikes this series by white.
111,2,35,1e5,b'r2n1qrk/pp1nb1pp/2p5/1P1Ppp2/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Fritz isn't liking what either of us have been doing. But we're both working our unique plans not just going after the .5 swing these moves are causing!
112,2,36,1dxc6,b'r2n1qrk/pp1nb1pp/2P5/1P2pp2/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Here I happen to choose a move that makes Fritz happy. Black has to reply.
113,2,37,1bxc6,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb1pp/2p5/1P2pp2/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',Be3 was possible but for my upcoming move I preferred Qh5...
114,2,38,2Qh5,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb1pp/2p5/1P2pp1Q/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R4R1K b - -',Now white is launching a serious attack. Pushing on the Queenside gave me mobility and restricted black's and now I can suddenly mount threats on the kingside too. Black is totally passive. Yes I'm still hanging the 'a' pawn lol. But I have bigger fish to fry than saving the lowly peasant alas. ;)
115,2,39,2g6,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb2p/2p3p1/1P2pp1Q/2P5/P1NB4/3B1PPP/R4R1K w - -',Black responds with Frit'z best choice.
116,2,40,2Qh3,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb2p/2p3p1/1P2pp2/2P5/P1NB3Q/3B1PPP/R4R1K b - -',I respond with Frit'z top choice of moves. Although my Queen is a bit out of position just now I have succeeded in really loosening up the black King's defenses. Time for a quick regroup and continue with the attack!
117,2,41,2cxb5,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb2p/6p1/1p2pp2/2P5/P1NB3Q/3B1PPP/R4R1K w - -',"Taking the a pawn was still possible but black is trying to free up his position... I just don't think he can do so safely at this point; and this allows my bishop to easily get to c4. But what else could black do here?
"
118,2,42,2cxb5,b'r2n1qrk/p2nb2p/6p1/1P2pp2/8/P1NB3Q/3B1PPP/R4R1K b - -',Retakes. And now Fritz thinks there are better things for black to do than take that a pawn.
119,2,43,2Bc4,b'r4qrk/p2nb2p/4n1p1/1P2pp2/2B5/P1N4Q/3B1PPP/R4R1K b - -',Ratcheting up the pressure... and at this point of the game black finally has no good reply now cramped positionally and with little king safety. This position is definitely winning for white now and Fritz agrees.
120,2,44,2Nf4,b'r4qrk/p2nb2p/6p1/1P2pp2/2B2n2/P1N4Q/3B1PPP/R4R1K w - -',Black is willing to give up the exchange but white still has a winning game. The continuation is a no-brainer...
121,2,45,Kxg8,b'r4qk1/p2nb2p/6p1/1P3p2/5p2/P1N4Q/5PPP/R4R1K w - -',Not a huge difference which piece recaptures. It's an easy white win although my opponent dislikes losing to an 'unrated' opponent and plays on a bit longer.
122,2,46,2Nd5,b'r4qk1/p2nb2p/6p1/1P1N1p2/5p2/P6Q/5PPP/R4R1K b - -',The best move.
123,2,47,2Bd6,b'r4qk1/p2n3p/3b2p1/1P1N1p2/5p2/P6Q/5PPP/R4R1K w - -',And... the best move. Suddenly the best moves are easier to spot!
124,2,48,2a4,b'r4qk1/p2n3p/3b2p1/1P1N1p2/P4p2/7Q/5PPP/R4R1K b - -',Rad1 was the best move and I thought about it. Connecting the pawns is not bad either and I choose to do that.
125,2,49,2Qf7,b'r5k1/p2n1q1p/3b2p1/1P1N1p2/P4p2/7Q/5PPP/R4R1K w - -',This move hangs the black rook allowing white to win a pawn by Nxf4. (...Bxf4 Qf3!) But Fritz likes Rad1 better and so did I.
126,2,50,2Qh6,b'r5k1/p2n1q1p/6pQ/1P1Nbp2/P4p2/8/5PPP/3R1R1K b - -',Now at this point of the game I no longer played sharply; the position is won for white and I lose interest. Better would have been Nb4 or Rfe1. I just want to trade pieces now and that is what this move was for.
127,2,51,2Nf6,b'r5k1/p4q1p/5npQ/1P1Nbp2/P4p2/8/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',Nc5 or Nb6 was much better. This move prevents the loss of the pawn for a while but further's white's advantage by allowing the trade.
128,2,52,Qxf6,b'r5k1/p6p/5qpQ/1P2bp2/P4p2/8/5PPP/3R1R1K w - -',Much better was taking with the bishop but it doesn't really matter anyways.
129,2,53,Qh8,b'r5kq/p2R3p/6pQ/1P2bp2/P4p2/8/5PPP/5R1K w - -',Bd4 or Re8 were much better. But it's not so easy to see in a Blitz game when one's king is under that much pressure. With the last few moves black has sealed his fate.
130,2,54,Bf6,b'r5kq/p2R3p/5bpQ/1P3p2/P4p2/8/5PPP/3R3K w - -',A momentary respite. So I'll reposition the queen with benefits...
131,2,55,Re8,b'4r1kq/p2R3p/5bp1/1P3p2/P4Q2/8/5PPP/3R3K w - -',And now something has to give. Unfortunately a quick mate is now possible.
132,2,56,Kf8,b'4rk1q/p2R3p/5bp1/1P3p2/P1Q5/8/5PPP/3R3K w - -',And Qf7 is mate. I was so bored and playing so quickly in this Blitz game (read: sloppily shame on me) I simply moved Rf7 then realized I had a mate and would have to move the rook again and move the queen. But after that last move Black finally resigned.
133,2,57,3Rf7+,b'4rk1q/p4R1p/5bp1/1P3p2/P1Q5/8/5PPP/3R3K b - -',Mate in two which should have already been mate. In retrospect I think black went wrong way back when he positioned his one bishop poorly instead of fianchettoing it. The cramped black position and open King's defenses contributed to white's success here many moves later. You know I find strong players sometimes fall into the trap of playing unrated opponents a bit more loosely than perhaps they should; mobility space king protection: these are all basic parts of the game and cannot be forgotten no matter who one's opponent is. Hope you enjoyed it!
134,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Queen pawn opeing for white.

For the piece Black gets two pawns his mobilization proceeds apace and a temporary bind is clamped over White's Queen wing.  All very well for Black but then what?  Black's game proceeds by threats swarming all over the board White having to fend off attacks here there and everywhere.

The general idea for White is to develop quickly and quietly remaining uncommitted for the nonce in the centre.  Once castled his broad plan is likely enough to bring the King's Knight to d2 then c4 where it attacks d6; then begin breakthrough operations with e2-e4.

Does White have to apprehend a possible ...Ng4 followed by ...Bd4 at some point?

I guess it is worth pointing out that d6 is the major strategic weakness that Black has to accept when playing a Modern Benoni.  That is the price he pays for the dynamic strengths of the whole opening and it is not a cheap one.
264,6,11,1Nb6,b'1rbqr1k1/1p3pbp/pn1p1np1/2pP4/P1N5/2N3PP/1P2PPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Had Black played the line 11...Rb8  12.Nc4 Nb6 then White would have played 13.Nxd6! here with the idea 13...Qxd6 14.Bf4 and a skewer.  The game is starting to warm up!
265,6,12,1Na3,b'1rbqr1k1/1p3pbp/pn1p1np1/2pP4/P7/N1N3PP/1P2PPB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So why does White not play 14.Nxd6 now?  The e8-Rook supplies the answer: 14.Nxd6 Qxd6  15.Bf4 Re5 and white has no way to augment the pin at e5.  White might take the rook right off - 16.Bxe5 Qxe5  and play on with R and P vs B and N; or retain the pin as long as possible whilst building up elsewhere e.g. 16.e4 Qe7  17.Qe2 Bd7 and the b8-Rook moves of next turn whereupon White takes the Exchange.  This might actually be a playable line for White but I reckon I'd prefer the Black pieces in the ensuing game.
266,6,13,1Bd7,b'1r1qr1k1/1p1b1pbp/pn1p1np1/2pP4/P7/N1N3PP/1P2PPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The way things are looking you would think that Black's b-pawn would never get to move: a Knight blocking his path and the hazards to be encountered upon the b5-square...  I might have played 14...Bf4 but why invite the thematic e2-e4?  Be it noted the g4-square isn't available neither.  So this restrained development seems to be indicated.  Sometimes ones choice of move is arrived at by a process of elimination.  But there was more to it than that. In my explorations of this line I had found an intriguing possibility...
267,6,14,1e4,b'1r1qr1k1/1p1b1pbp/pn1p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/N1N3PP/1P3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - e3',White carries on with his strategic plan.

269,6,16,Nxe4,b'1r1qr1k1/1p1b1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/N3n3/N5PP/1P3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Before throwing forward the b-pawn Black wants to get as much material for the Knight as he can.  So we snap up the loose e-pawn.
270,6,17,1Qc2,b'1r1qr1k1/1p1b1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/N3n3/N5PP/1PQ2PB1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Threatening to take the knight (Bxe4)...

The latter is unplayable: 17...Bf5 18.g4 puts paid to that.  But 17...f5  18.Nc3 actually costs Black time that White can use to bring his Knights back to safety and into the centre.  Apparently paradoxically moving the Knight again gains time - by striking at the d-pawn but also the threat to gain several tempi with the advance of the b-pawn striking at the White Knights.
272,6,19,1Nc3,b'1r1qr1k1/1p1b1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/8/N1N3PP/1PQ2PB1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Hastily racing towards the centre.

I know I'm making this sound as though Black has the advantage.  Certainly the initiative lies with Black at least for the moment.  But bear in mind Black has given up a knight even if he has two pawns for it.  So Black has to  play actively even just to retain the initiative and stay on level terms.

This is much better than chasing the Knight by 19...b4? as it would then simply move happily into c4 a snug spot from which to menace d6.  After the text the Knight can escape via b1 but White prefers to develop.
276,6,23,2Bf4,b'1r1qr1k1/3b1pbp/p2p1np1/1p1P4/2p2B2/N5PP/1PQ1NPB1/R4RK1 b - -',Striking at d6.  If White can come up with enough threats he might be able to wrest from Black the initiative.  If that happens then Black is in trouble.

From this point on White finds himself subject to pin-pricking threats from all directions each easily enough dealt with but with the cumulative effect of driving White further and further onto the defensive.
278,6,25,2Qd1,b'1r1qr1k1/5pbp/p2p1np1/1p1P1b2/2p2B2/N5PP/1P2NPB1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The only alternative: 21.Qd2 looks none too attractive after 21...Ne4  21.Bxe4 Bxe4  22.Re1 Qc8 -(threatening to take on h3 but possibly more dangerously to white to shove the c-pawn)- 23.Nc3 Bxc3!  24.bxc3 ... -(not with the Queen on account of 24.Qxc3 b4) 24...Qxh3. 
279,6,26,2Qd7,b'1r2r1k1/3q1pbp/p2p1np1/1p1P1b2/2p2B2/N5PP/1P2NPB1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Suddenly striking towards the K-side: ...Bxh3 is threatened.

The most obvious and the move I expected was 22.g4 with the possibility 22...Bd3 23.Re1 Ne4 and a complicated and unclear position.  Possibly even better was to get in 22.Nc2 first with a counter-strike against a6.  If Black then tried 22...Ra8 then back to the 23.g4 gig.  
281,6,28,2Re1,b'1r2r1k1/3q1pbp/p2p1np1/1p1P4/2p2B2/N2b2PP/1P2NPBK/R2QR3 b - -',Unpinning and protecting at the same time.   It is economical defensive moves like this that makes an attacker's job hard.

Whilst the fire support team (the Black bishops) lays down a machine-gun fire the assault team (the Black Q-side pawns) moves in.  All sorts of threats are present here - ...Bxb2; ...Nxf4; ...b4...  How can White defend?
283,6,30,2Bc1,b'1r2r1k1/3q1pbp/p2p2p1/1p1P3n/2p5/N2b2PP/1P2NPBK/R1BQR3 b - -',This retreat seems to cover the bases but perhaps something more active was called for.  Worth a look I think would have been 24.Nc2! Bxb2!?  25.Rxa6 Nxf4  26.Nxf4 Rxe1ch  27.Nxe1 Bf5  28.Nc2.  Although Black has a well-supported pair of passed pawns White still has the extra Knight.  I'd probably be reasonably happy with such a position as Black but the issue would still be very much in doubt.
284,6,31,2Qf5,b'1r2r1k1/5pbp/p2p2p1/1p1P1q1n/2p5/N2b2PP/1P2NPBK/R1BQR3 w - -',[?!]  Showing a real interest in the f2-square.  It was too much to hope for 25.g4 but 25.f4 was the move I expected and as it turns out probably White's best chance as Black would really have had to do something about the threat g3-g4.  I have a feeling I got the move order wrong here as 24...b4!  25.Nc2 Qf5!  26.Ne3 Qxf2  27.Ng4 Qb6 and with material now about level and still well placed Black must have had the edge.
285,6,32,2Kg1,b'1r2r1k1/5pbp/p2p2p1/1p1P1q1n/2p5/N2b2PP/1P2NPB1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',[?] As already observed 25.f4 was best.  Possibly White didb't want to weaken his pawn structure around his King and felt that f2 would be sufficiently protected by the King.  He was right about that but now Black was free to carry out what he should have done a move earlier.
286,6,33,2b4,b'1r2r1k1/5pbp/p2p2p1/3P1q1n/1pp5/N2b2PP/1P2NPB1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Bang.  There is no good immediate Knight move to escape entrapment on a3.  But what about 26.g4 hoping to trade Knights?  Comes 25.g4 Qe5 and both White knights are attacked for Black's one.  About to lose a piece after being subjected to a flurry of blows for the last half-dozen moves or so White resigned.   I think he could have played on a little: Black's edge was not yet decisive.  But the decision to call a halt here was at least understandable.

Rather unwisely (and unnecessarily) I played an attacking line that was far riskier than I had calculated upon.  Though far behind in material White's active pieces came within an ace of turning the tables.  Here's the plot.
386,10,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The Centre Game.  In my view it is really only worth playing this if you are going to play the Scotch Game or a gambit.  I believe White knew exactly what he wanted to play the moment he saw my first move.

391,10,6,Bxb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',I recall seeing this for the first time as a schoolboy.  The line seemed so fraught with possibilities the way those bishops raked down towards Black's undeveloped position.  As it turns out Black's lack of development leaves him a position flexible in defence.
392,10,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',!?  It is hard to know what's best here.  This seemed safe enough.  I was within an ace of playing the 'Schlechter Antidote' here and possibly my opponent was hoping I would try it on.  After 5...d5!?  6.Bxd5 Nf6  7.Bxf7ch! Kxf7  8.Qxd8 ... Has White won Black's Queen?  Not... quite: 8...Bb4ch  9.Qd2 Bxd2  10.Nxd2 c5.  The game becomes a battle between Black's 3-1 majority on the Q-side and White's 4-2 majority on the K-side.  My copy of MCO10 indicates Black would have the better of it but I'm not so sure.

The fork threat (Nxc7) is the least of it.  The biggy is this 20.Ndxe7ch Kh8?? (...Kf7 is forced in fact) 21.Bxg7#.  After a fair bit of thought I found Black had no option but to carry on with his own attack.

Qh3  or 24...Nxf5  25.Qc4ch d5  26.Qxd5ch either way White is back in the game good and properly)  24.Nxc6! bxc6! (...and not 24...dxc6?  25.Rg1 Qh3  26.Rg3 Qh5  27.Qb3ch! Be6  28.Qxe6ch Kxe6  29.Nxg7ch Kd7  30.Nxh5 and white emerges with a very slight material plus!).  I'll leave the analysis there with about as murky a position as could be wished for.

Cmethan even pointed out that it was mate in one.   In this position how is mate inevitable?  10...Kg7 (forced) 11.Qf7# so I resigned.  There are two morals to this story.  The first one is what this opponent told me.  It is more important to develop early and control the center then to take a piece with a non developing move.  The idea being is that it is usually a bad idea to develop the f pawn early in the game since it is a non central pawn.  The second lesson but more importantly is what Jack Stockel taught me last Friday.  Sometimes ""To take is a mistake"" and your opponent does not just blunder away material.  Until recently I assumed that my opponents always had a bad reason for giving things away so I figured that I just knew their week spot.  And I also thought that I was taking advantage of their weakness but that is not always the case.  More often then not the opposing player usually has a good reason for sacrificing material so they are not unsound sacrifices.  It is normally done to set the opponent up for disaster.  So making a capture like this is underestimating him or her.   "

581,17,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is a training game between id=stalhandske and MGW (Mighty G Warriors) where the members of the G team conferred about the next move before making it. The opening is Sicilian but....
582,17,1,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/1P2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',I have an inbuilt dislike of the Sicilian (either colour) probably because it is one of the most complicated and at the same time most studied opening with huge amounts of theory (that I have not absorbed). I have therefore actively looked at alternatives. 2. b4 is the Wing Gambit that is practised also in other openings (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Gambit) which was recommended to me by one of GK:s top players and which I liked instantly. Perhaps because it changes the nature of the game entirely away from most (all?) Sicilian variations.
583,17,2,cxb4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/1p2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',There is no reason for black not to accept the sacrifice

585,17,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/1p2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3....Nc6 is logical but leaves the initiative with white. 3...d5 had been better; after 4. exd5 Qxd5 the position would smell like the Scandinavian opening but  - relative to that - with advantage for black since white cannot play Nc3 
586,17,5,axb4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/1P2P3/8/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White now takes the initiative 
587,17,6,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/1n1PP3/8/2P2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',...and from this position the advantage of the Wing Gambit is obvious. Control of the centre and better development than black. Personally I like the open lines and the possibilities of white's attack via the Q side 
588,17,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a clear loss of a tempo for black whilst white supports his centre pawns

620,18,19,Rxc2,b'5r2/q4p1k/3p2pp/8/1Q2P3/1B1PRP2/1Pr3PP/6K1 w - -',This was a good move!
621,18,20,2Bxc2,b'5r2/q4p1k/3p2pp/8/1Q2P3/3PRP2/1PB3PP/6K1 b - -',But sadly I fall for the trap:(
622,18,21,Qxg2,b'5r2/5p1k/3p2pp/8/1Q2P3/3PKP2/1P4qP/8 w - -',He's taking my pawns away.
623,18,22,Qxb2,b'5r2/5p1k/3Q2pp/8/4P3/3PKP2/1q5P/8 w - -',this was a HORRIBLE move!
624,18,23,3Qxg6,b'7k/8/5pQp/8/4P3/3PKP2/1q5P/8 b - -',He has very few pawns left now.
625,18,24,3d4,b'7k/8/1q3pQp/8/3PP3/4KP2/7P/8 b - -',Pass pawns must be pushed!
626,18,25,4d5,b'8/7k/5p2/3P4/4P3/4KP2/7P/8 b - -',He resigned at this point because I have more pawns and I have an open file for the pawn to get through.
627,19,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',He plays the Sicilian. I haven't studied it 20 moves deep like some grandmasters but I know the basics. 
628,19,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I choose the open Sicilian. 
629,19,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',All standard so far.
630,19,3,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',This hasn't been played very many times but it can't be bad as over five hundred people have played it in the database.
631,19,4,Be6,b'r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',We are still in the database but coming close to the end.
632,19,5,Bxc6+,b'r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1Bpb3/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',We are now out of the database. I think capturing the knight is a bit of a mistake as it brings his pawn closer to the center. The only positive note is that his a pawn is isolated. 
633,19,6,O-O,b'r2qkbnr/5ppp/p1ppb3/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I tuck my king into safety. He's still at least three moves away from doing so unless he chooses to castle queenside which would not be wise as there are many holes in his pawn cover.
634,19,7,h6,b'r2qk1nr/4bpp1/p1ppb2p/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',!? This doesn't seem to do anything except maybe start a pawn storm if he chooses to castle queenside after all. 
635,19,8,1Qd2,b'r2qk1nr/4bpp1/p1ppb2p/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',Considering something like Bxh6!? after he castles. If I bring enough pieces to follow it up first the sacrifice might be worth it.
636,19,9,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/p1ppbn1p/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPPQ1PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',He castles maybe I should start looking to start shifting my knights over to the kingside.
637,19,10,1a4,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/p1ppbn1p/4p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PPQ1PPP/3R1RK1 b - a3',Seems to be a wasted move.

639,19,12,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/3p1n1p/p1pPp3/P1P5/1N2B3/1P1Q1PPP/3R1RK1 b - c3',I back up the center.

642,19,15,1Qd3,b'1r1q1rk1/4bpp1/3p3p/p1pPp3/P1P1n3/1N1QB3/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Instead I simply chase his knight away.

644,19,17,1e4,b'1r1q1rk1/4bpp1/3p1n1p/p1pP4/P1P1pP2/1N1QB3/1P4PP/3R1RK1 w - -',This was probably the best decision.

648,19,21,Ra2,b'1r4k1/4bpp1/3p3p/p1pP4/P1P1pP2/4R3/r2N2PP/3R2K1 w - -',Let's review this position. Material black is ahead by a pawn. Pawn structure my d pawn is cramping him slightly but he has a passed pawn on e4 but it is immemorial since I can capture it at any time. We both control the center equally and his pieces seem slightly more active. Overall I'd prefer black here.
649,19,22,Rxd2,b'6k1/4Rpp1/3p3p/p1pP4/P1P2P2/8/3r2PP/6K1 w - -',After a few exchanges material has equalized again and so has position. We both have a rook on the seventh rank (second for him) Our pawn structure very similar and no one seems to have the advantage. 
650,19,23,3Rd7,b'6k1/3R1pp1/3p3p/p1pP4/P1P2P2/8/3r2PP/6K1 b - -',I start to pick off his pawns
651,19,24,3Rc2,b'6k1/3R1pp1/3p3p/p1pP4/P1P2P2/8/2r3PP/6K1 w - -',So does he
652,19,25,3Rxc5,b'6k1/5pp1/7p/p1RP4/r4P2/8/6PP/6K1 b - -',Both rooks gobble up pawns giving us both an isolated passer.
653,19,26,3Ra1+,b'6k1/5pp1/7p/p1RP4/5P2/8/6PP/r5K1 w - -',I'm not sure this is great it just pushes my king to the center. In most cases in rook endings checks are worthless. Most of the time.
654,19,27,Ra2+,b'6k1/5pp1/7p/p1RP4/5P2/8/r4KPP/8 w - -',This is the same. He's just moving my king closer and closer
655,19,28,Kh7,b'8/5ppk/7p/p1RP4/5P2/4K3/r5PP/8 w - -',He decides to move his king in
656,19,29,Ra3+,b'8/5ppk/3P3p/p1R5/5P2/r3K3/6PP/8 w - -',Remember what I said about useless rook checks?
657,19,30,3Kd5,b'8/5ppk/3P3p/p1RK4/r4P2/8/6PP/8 b - -',Now let's review this position. Material: equal passed pawns: we each have one but mine is much more valuable since it is a lot closer to queening. Pawn structure: Neither of us have any doubled pawns we both have an isolated pawn other than that it is almost identical. King position: My king is much more centralized. Piece activity: my rook is slightly more active. 
658,19,31,3Kg6,b'8/5pp1/3P2kp/p1RK4/r4P2/8/6PP/8 w - -',?? Now he can't stop me from queening.
659,19,32,Rxf4,b'8/3P1pp1/6kp/p1RK4/5r2/8/6PP/8 w - -',He takes what he can
660,19,33,4d8=Q,b'3Q4/5pp1/6kp/p1RK4/5r2/8/6PP/8 b - -',Poof! 
661,19,34,Rf6+,b'3Q4/5pp1/2K2rkp/p1R5/8/8/6PP/8 w - -',Maybe he's going for perpetual check?
662,19,35,4Qxf6,b'8/5ppk/5Q1p/pKR5/8/8/6PP/8 b - -',This is a simplification sacrifice. I probably wouldn't have played it if his king hadn't moved but this way it splits up his pawn structure too. It's only a matter of time before I pick off most of his pawns If I have to sac my rook to do it I'll promote a pawn.
663,19,36,4Rc4,b'8/5p2/6kp/K4p2/2R4P/8/6P1/8 b - -',If his pawn advances any further it dies. If the king moves anywhere except f6 the pawn dies. 
664,19,37,4g3,b'8/5p2/6k1/K4p1p/2R4P/6P1/8/8 b - -',Now I can move my rook without fear of his pawn advancing.
665,19,38,4Rf4,b'8/8/5pk1/K4p1p/5R1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',Black is in zugzwang. 
666,19,39,f5,b'8/8/6k1/K4p1p/5R1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',Time to bring my king over.
667,19,40,5Kd5,b'8/8/5k2/3K1p1p/5R1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',His king must move back and after that my king will move forward and with his help the rook will capture the remaining black pawns.
668,19,41,5Ke5,b'8/8/6k1/4Kp1p/5R1P/6P1/8/8 b - -',Black resigns. Good game to black. I don't think I played too badly especially the endgame. However if you have a different opinion please comment. I'd appreciate it if you'd rate my annotation. 
669,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Usual first move.

701,21,5,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/5n1p/3pp1p1/2PP3B/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq g6',Black being aggressive dictating White's responses gaining initiative and commanding more board space.

706,21,10,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp5/5p1p/6p1/1bPPp3/6B1/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Now White must trade his Q for a B and put himself in a very bad exposed position.

710,22,1,Nxf7,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1N2/7p/8/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',All games in this tournament started here. The acid test of the gambit is to accept so that's what I did.
711,22,2,d5,b'rnbq1bnr/ppp2k2/7p/3p4/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ d6',If I'm going to survive the attack I have to develop quickly which is why I preferred this to 7 ... Ke8 this gives back a pawn but since the one on g4 would have been dropping anyway I'm not really losing out. 
712,22,3,Kg7,b'rnbq1bnr/ppp3k1/7p/3B4/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ -',My plan was to try to hide my king in the corner and surround it with pieces. As it turns out I don't have time in view of this 8 ... Ke8 might be a better try
713,22,4,Bxb7,b'rnbq1bnr/pBp3k1/7p/8/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQ -',Brilliant move and one I would use if given the opportunity now. I'm now left with a choice of accepting the second piece but leaving my king to be chased around or giving up a rook and trying to play for an attack of my own. I didn't really see a good way to do the latter though I'm just not developed enough.
714,22,5,Bxb7,b'rn1q1bnr/pbp3k1/7p/8/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Second gambit accepted let the king chase begin!
715,22,6,Ke6,b'rn1q1bnr/pbp5/4k2p/7Q/4Pp1P/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',This looks odd but 11 ... Ke7 loses the rook after 12. Qe5+ and the placement of the queen now prevents any hope of safety in the kingside corner. I thought I had to try to hide in the other corner and hope I didn't have to give up huge amounts of material to save my tired king.
716,22,7,Kd6,b'rn1q1bnr/pbp5/3k3p/5Q2/4Pp1P/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',12 ... Ke7 fails as before.
717,22,8,Bg7,b'rn1q2nr/pbp3b1/3k3p/5Q2/3PPp1P/8/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Had to prevent Qe5+. This also frees my Queen from the defence of the Bishop. If 14. Bxf4+ I had planned 14 ... Ke7 15. Qc5+ Ke8 and slowly white is running out of meaningful checks.

719,22,10,1Bf6,b'rn1q2nr/pbp5/3k1bQp/8/3PPp1P/8/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',I considered 14 ... Nf6 too but thought I would end up having to give up two pieces then. At least this way I can keep some defenders near my king which is in desperate need of some! Interestingly the computer thinks I have a winning advantage not sure I agree but at least it shows that I've defended quite well up to this point.
720,22,11,1c3,b'rn1q2nr/pbp5/4kbQp/4P3/3P1p1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Can't quite understand this move I realise the Bishop isn't going anywhere but I don't see why defending d4 suddenly becomes a priority. I was expecting white to either play exf6 or develop instead. Perhaps moves like this is the difference between 1950 and 2100?
721,22,12,1Nd7,b'r2q2nr/pbpn4/4kbQp/4P3/3P1p1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',With my king still fixed in the centre I decide to develop. More pieces means more safety in theory.
722,22,13,Kxf5,b'r5nr/pbpn4/7p/5k2/3P1p1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',At last I get the pesky queen off the board it cost me most of the gambit material to do so but I felt quite happy with this position. Given how alarming the queen's invasion had looked things could have been a lot worse.
723,22,14,Ngf6,b'r6r/pbpn4/5n1p/5k2/3P1p1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB2RK1 w - -',I can't save the f-pawn so I develop my worst piece instead.
724,22,15,Ke6,b'r6r/pbpn4/4kn1p/8/3P1B1P/2P5/PP4P1/RN3RK1 w - -',The computer says this is a mistake. Indeed in the cold light of day moving my king back to the centre seems odd. I was trying to keep the g-file open for some play of my own I think. In hindsight running to the corner with 21 ... Kg6 was probably better I didn't appreciate just how much of a target my king still was even with the queens off the board. The computer suggests I have a slight advantage if I play 21 ... Ba6 thereby preventing any discovered checks and it seems I can even force a bishop exchange (eg 21 ... Ba6 22. Rf3 [22 Rf2 Ne4 23 Rf3 Be2 wins a piece] Be2 23. Rf2 Ne4 24. Rxe2 Kxf4). 
725,22,16,c5,b'6rr/pb1n1k2/5n1p/2p5/3P1B1P/2P3P1/PP1N4/4RRK1 w - c6',This is where things start to go really wrong. I save my c-pawn but give up the dangerous square d6 which my opponent immediately exploits.
726,22,17,Kg6,b'6rr/pb1n4/5nkp/2p5/2NP1B1P/2P3P1/PP6/4RRK1 w - -',25 ... Kg7 would have walked into some rather dangerous pins and discovered checks. After 26. Re7+ I have the choice of going to g6 anyway after which 27. Be5 is coming or moving back to f8 and walking into the extremely nasty 27. Bd6 (see how important that d6 square was!). 
727,22,18,2h5+,b'5r1r/pb6/5nkp/2p1B2P/3P4/2P3P1/PP6/4RRK1 b - -',Game over. I have to give up the exchange at the very least. As it happens I ended up giving up the whole rook.

Things I learned

1. When accepting gambits be prepared to give some material back to ease the pressure on an unsafe king
2. When you think the fire is out don't relax! Make sure it's out.
3. Moving a pawn will often give up a square make sure the square is not important."

Even though I potentially surrender an open g file on the king I gain more material in the process and the white g pawn is still an effective blocker.

948,29,44,4Rc3,b'8/8/6pk/5p2/5r2/2R5/3K4/8 b - -',This was the final mistake that allowed me to seal up the win.  Better would have been Ke3.
949,29,45,4Re4,b'8/8/6pk/5p2/4r3/2R5/3K4/8 w - -',This move shuts the White King out of the rest of the game.  Had white played Ke3 on move 43 the subsequent moves would have been 43...Re4+  44. Kf3 or Kf2 and the White King would have been a major factor in the end game.  It is now isolated on the Queen side and is a bystander for the endgame.  White's only choice here is to trade rooks and hope for a stalemate.  White does not do this and the result is inevitable.

Now I see that four other opponent's pieces (two bishops the knight on f3 and the Queen) are aimed towards my king and after I had lead my rook astray I don't have any means to counter that. My first thought was to play Qxd5 but I suspected N3g5 would make my life miserable. I knew it was not going to end well...

Partly because I see no other move partly because I was interested in how the opponent's combination would unfold. The Gameknot computer that analysed the game after it was finished was okay with this move but frankly I don't believe it. I think the game was lost at this point.

Note how the sacrificed knight contributed to this move taking away my d6 pawn on 14-th move. In my opinion the knight's route b5-d6-f7 is one of the most devious and cunning sequences performed by one piece."

Note that in the end a rook and a knight remain undeveloped. I see my first and foremost mistake in forsaking the normal development of pieces. For example 13. ... axb5 would have opened some opportunities for my second rook and 14. ...

Black is massively ahead but white had a devastating attack going on that might make black sac more material to defend. Also black's rooks aren't really doing anything and his minor pieces are either (in the case of the d knight) tied down defending against something or (in the case of the bishop and knight) lured over there and incapable of assisting the defense more than a little.

1261,39,42,2Bc5,b'2rk3r/1QpqnB1p/3p2p1/2B1p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 b - -',Black's best move in response to this is the move he plays!...
1262,39,43,2Qc6,b'2rk3r/1Qp1nB1p/2qp2p1/2B1p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 w - -',25. ...Qc6. [computer suggests 25. ...Nc6].  The game is even in terms of material and black has gained some potential mobility.  I ALMOST played the interesting 25.	Bc5	Qc6 26.	Bxd6	Qxb7 27.	Bxe5+	Nd5 28.	Bxd5	Qb5 29.	Bxh8 here	but I didn't have the nerve to leave black with his queen and me without mine.  Instead played...
1263,39,44,2Qxc6,b'2rk3r/2p1nB1p/2Qp2p1/2B1p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 b - -',the frustrating QxQ!!! [computer suggests 26. Qb4 and shows white's advantage deteriorating]
1264,39,45,2Nxc6,b'2rk3r/2p2B1p/2np2p1/2B1p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 w - -',recaptures 26. ...NxQ.
1265,39,46,2Bd5,b'2rk3r/2p4p/2np2p1/2BBp1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 b - -',Recognizing the strength of his pawns black does not take the bait (does not play dxc5)...
1266,39,47,2Ne7,b'2rk3r/2p1n2p/3p2p1/2BBp1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 w - -',and puts that infernal knight back on e7!!!!!!
1267,39,48,2Be6,b'2rk3r/2p1n2p/3pB1p1/2B1p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 b - -',28. Be6 protects the bishop.
1268,39,49,2Bxd6,b'1r1k3r/2p1n2p/3BB1p1/4p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K1R1R2 b - -',That's it!  White takes drastic measures and trades the B for two pawns.  Somewhat nervy this far along. [computer really dislikes this move and call the game even white having had an advantage for the last 25 moves!]
1269,39,50,3Rxd6+,b'1r1k3r/4n2p/3RB1p1/4p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K3R2 b - -',30. RxP. The game is turning in to an epic.
1270,39,51,3Bf7+,b'1r2k2r/4nB1p/3R2p1/4p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K3R2 b - -',31. Bf7+
1271,39,52,3Kf8,b'1r3k1r/4nB1p/3R2p1/4p1b1/8/6P1/PPP4P/1K3R2 w - -',31. ...Kf8 gives white some interesting tactical options.  BUT...
1272,39,53,3h4,b'1r3k1r/4nB1p/3R2p1/4p1b1/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K3R2 b - h3',This is an error. [computer calls it minor].  I had thought I could play Bxg6+ or h4 in any order (my target is the knight pushing the bishop aside is required). But I missed black's response which reveals Bxg6 had to be played first.  I believe this mistake causes the game to extend longer than if I had made the correct move.
1273,39,54,3Nf5,b'1r3k1r/5B1p/3R2p1/4pnb1/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K3R2 w - -',Ugh! The knight is now safe and two of white's pieces are now under attack!  
1274,39,55,3Bxg6,b'1r3k1r/7p/3R2B1/4pnb1/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K3R2 b - -',Solution: another exchange of a bishop for two pawns!  Yikes!
1275,39,56,3Rxg6,b'1r3k1r/8/6R1/4pnb1/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K3R2 b - -',Ok one more pawn to go.  Knight can not be saved.
1276,39,57,3Bh6,b'1r3k1r/8/6Rb/4pn2/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K3R2 w - -',34. Bh6 [computer dislikes this move and returns advantage to white.  suggested line seems odd to me]
1277,39,58,3Rxf5+,b'1r3k1r/8/6Rb/4pR2/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K6 b - -',RxN with sights on the final pawn (white has apparently forgotten the object of the game).  This capture makes up for the bishop exchanges B+B for P+P+P+P+N.
1278,39,59,3Rxe5+,b'1r5r/4k3/6Rb/4R3/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K6 b - -',A complete set.  This is only the second time I've collected all of an opponent's pawns.  Black is plenty dangerous with his R+R+B vs my R+R+pawns. 
1279,39,60,3Kf7,b'1r5r/5k2/6Rb/4R3/7P/6P1/PPP5/1K6 w - -',36. ...Kf7. leads toward another mistake by white.  Keep an eye on b2.
1280,39,61,3h5,b'1r5r/5k2/6Rb/4R2P/8/6P1/PPP5/1K6 b - -',Preferable to Rge6 (which endangers b2) or Ree6 (which is uninteresting).  So I AM paying attention to b2!
1281,39,62,3Bg7,b'1r5r/5kb1/6R1/4R2P/8/6P1/PPP5/1K6 w - -',37. ...Bg7 [computer strongly prefers ...Rbg8]
1282,39,63,3Rf5+,b'1r5r/5kb1/6R1/5R1P/8/6P1/PPP5/1K6 b - -',38. Rf5+ and black must play ...Kg8 or lose the B.  
1283,39,64,3Kg8,b'1r4kr/6b1/6R1/5R1P/8/6P1/PPP5/1K6 w - -',I've often thought of this strange situation.  That bishop is pinned and so CAN NOT go to b2!!!!  And yet...
1284,39,65,3Rfg5,b'1r4kr/6b1/6R1/6RP/8/6P1/PPP5/1K6 b - -',had I been thinking I would have protected the b-pawn.  Another mistake. [computer does not dislike this move]
1285,39,66,3Rxb2+,b'6kr/6b1/6R1/6RP/8/6P1/PrP5/1K6 w - -',A strange property of chess that a pinned piece still provides support to other pieces and still cuts off access to the opposing king.  This is the first time I've been tripped up like this.   Perhaps the game will end in a draw.   [computer actually slightly increases advantage to white here though offers no alternative for black]
1286,39,67,4Rg6xg7+,b'6kr/6R1/8/6RP/8/6P1/r1P5/2K5 b - -',RxB and white regains an edge though with far fewer pawns than he should have.
1287,39,68,Rxh5,b'5k2/6R1/8/6Rr/8/6P1/r1PK4/8 w - -',42. ...Rxh5 another excellent move by black. On the other hand it relieves white from having to do too much thinking.
1288,39,69,4Rxh5,b'5k2/6R1/8/7R/8/6P1/r1PK4/8 b - -',RxR
1289,39,70,4Kxg7,b'8/6k1/8/7R/8/6P1/r1PK4/8 w - -',QxR and black creates a situation where white will have plenty of chances to blunder in to a draw.
1290,39,71,4Re5,b'8/6k1/8/4R3/8/6P1/r1PK4/8 b - -',White however plays a decent endgame.
1291,39,72,4c5,b'r7/8/8/2P5/3K2k1/4R1P1/8/8 b - -',I've never been in a situation where I played out the Lucena position in a game.  However I have studied and practiced it a little.  Several of the remaining moves borrow from techniques related to this study.  For example if I am going to push the rook to where it is no longer dangerous the pawn needs to be on c5 not c4.  I was nervous I wouldn't be able to pull the needed points out of my memory.  See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtT0StMqKQ for more info.  VERY useful!  And should be reviewed and practiced a few times a year.
1292,39,73,5Kb5,b'2r5/8/8/1KP5/6k1/4R1P1/8/8 b - -',51. Kb5
1293,39,74,5Kc6,b'1r6/8/2K5/2P5/6k1/4R1P1/8/8 b - -',"Moves 52 through 54 are similar to the ""bridge"" technique used when playing from the Lucena position except in reverse."
1294,39,75,5Kc7,b'1r6/2K5/8/2P5/6k1/4R1P1/8/8 b - -',Displaces the rook.
1295,39,76,5Rd3,b'8/2K5/2P5/8/6k1/3R2P1/8/2r5 b - -',I believe I could have played Kb7 or Kd7 here.  But I think I had to create a shelter on d or B or black could continue to harass my K from my home rank.  Forces him to a flank.
1296,39,77,5c7,b'8/1KP4r/8/8/6k1/3R2P1/8/8 b - -',black resigns.  Quite a game!  [all in all computer notes problems with white 10 times and with black 12 times].  Thank you to The Snowman for playing.  Comments welcome.
