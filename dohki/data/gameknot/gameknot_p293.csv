i also realised here that if white was careless he could fall quickly to a knight fork on c2. hense the following move."

41,2,17,1Nxb6+,b'r2qk2r/p3bppp/1N2p3/1B3b2/3P4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',black plays on perhaps seeing white's king is undefended and his rooks undeveloped.
42,2,18,1O-O,b'q4k1r/p3bppp/4p3/1B3b2/3P4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',white castles anyway but weary of a well placed sacrifice. the knight c3 is well placed!

44,2,20,1d5,b'q4k1r/p3bp1p/4p1p1/1B1P1b2/8/1QN5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',white intends to exchange queens. black has to take the pawn here else accept a passed pawn. for what follows perhaps he should have.
45,2,21,Qb8,b'1q3k1r/p3bp1p/6p1/1B1Q1b2/8/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',black is wise to keep his queen but white finds a little maneuver to remove the strong bishop pair.
46,2,22,Be6,b'1q3k1r/p3bp1p/4b1p1/3Q4/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',unless you like the idea of Qe7.

54,3,6,Ref8,b'b2r1r2/6k1/4p1pp/p3N3/Pb1pPP2/1P1P1N2/2P1R1PP/5RK1 w - -',That Pawn on d is a tempting target once he moves that Rook from defending it but I must be careful as long as he has that Black-Square Bishop that could pin the Knight there.
55,3,7,Bxe5,b'b4rr1/6k1/4p2p/p3b3/P2pPP1N/1P1P1R2/2P1R1PP/6K1 w - -',The thing I have been watchful of is the two Bishops he has. I have been careful not to give them an open diagonal toward my King's side. Now he has traded one Bishop so I will be less worried about the other. I also may go after that pawn on d now that the dangerous Bishop is gone.
56,3,8,3Rg3+,b'5rr1/6k1/2b1p2p/p3P3/P2pP2N/1P1P2R1/2P1R1PP/6K1 b - -',SInce I have a material advantage now I only need to worry about some clever attack by his Rooks and Bishop. I can force trades to eliminate his offensive capabilities which will leave me to methodically drive forward to a win.
57,3,9,h5,b'8/2r4k/4p3/4P2p/P1NpP3/1P1P3P/2P2RP1/3b2K1 w - -',I had intended to move the Pawn on g to g4 in order to trap his Bishop but he saved me the trouble.

1) you retreat your rook - the best I can analyse is a forced draw ..
2) you come forward with your king and I can't force mate.

3) you do something silly and take the pawn on e6

A good game - you didn't capitulate under pressure as you have before and were solid in your moves. Gave me plenty to think about at all times during the game...

One reason for this is the axiom: the tactics come out of the strategy.  Another reason however is that strategy is relatively unknown to many players (who often play tactically) and can't tell the difference between the two.  This unfamiliarity gives the strategic view a double advantage.  As an aid to the counting of strategic ideas I employ the Point Count Method.  This is not so much a ""scoring system"" so much as just what the name implies: a method of counting strategic advantages and disadvantages."

The mate threat from the doubled rooks forms the central theme in the left flank of this position.  White has a point for the mobile pawn wing a point for the (occupiable) outpost on e4 another for greater space a BIG point for the half-open h-file a point for his passed pawn on d5 (though its utility is debatable) a minus point for the backward pawn on f3 (though White does some juking and duking around it later) and another minus point for his king position (net  3 p.c.).  Black has a point for his (occupiable) outpost on f4 a point for his superior development another for the bishop pair a BIG (and ultimately fatal for White) point for the half-open f-file and a point for the passed pawn.  Black's minus's are his rather cramped position (net  4 p.c.).  This is a prime example of where the Point Count can show that ultimately Black does have the long-term strategic advantage but without caution the tactics will rule the day.

Black then adopts a light-squared strategy rather than the more popular kingside fianchetto.  I offer a pawn on move 8 which Black declines.

Black is developing along the lines of the Grivas Sicilian made popular by Greek GM Efstratios Grivas.  The biggest strategic difference is that there is no White pawn on e4 hence the white light-squared bishop will be a more active participant in pressuring Black's queenside.

I hadn't had any experience in these lines prior to this game but protecting the c4-pawn seemed to hand Black the initiative and this is most likely the case.

What really struck me at this point was that the Black light-squared bishop is entombed and so is the Black King's rook.  This leaves me essentially a piece up on the Queenside after Bf4 and Two pieces up with the participation of both rooks which comes quickly.  Black's King is also stuck in the center.  Anand chose to limit the compensation by playing 12...d5 however the advance of the queenside majority decided the issue before the two lame pieces got developed.

695,28,8,a4,b'r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2n5/1B2N3/P3p3/8/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq a3',A blunder. By exchanging knights and bishops white would have left black with a terrible pawn structure. How is it possible to make an error like this one? Of course white obviously played too fast. But another explanation can be this: it is very easy to overlook a threat when it is not directly a consequence of the piece actually played. Black played his bishop on move 7. The bishop does not threaten anything. So it is quite possible when one plays fast to overlook that the black knight on c6 is now unpinned and can now take the white knight. One must always try to consider not just the piece that has moved but also how this movement affects the dynamics of the other pieces on the board.

702,28,15,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pppb1ppp/3b1q2/4n3/P7/3B4/1PPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Why this move? It develops a piece. But the real reason is that the rook is now on the same column as the white queen! While this may seem a bit wild for a reason (there are now 4 pieces between the rook and the queen) it is surprising how fast sometimes pieces can get out of the way and all of a sudden the rook can take the queen!!

708,28,21,Bxa4,b'3r1rk1/p1p2p2/1p3p2/8/bP6/4B3/2P2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Black can try this because of white's weak first rank (the rook can not leave because of mate).

1) My knight holds a powerful square in the centre
2) My d7 bishop can now get out onto the board
3) The c-file is now wide open offering good attacking chances (to either side)
The other posibility would have been ...e5 driving the powerfully placed white knight away and gaining a tempo to move out the rook on the next move."

752,31,14,1Rxc4,b'3q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/8/2rN4/1P2P3/P2QNPPP/5RK1 w - -',I chose to capture an easy choice as I have the chance to put pressure on the 2 isolated pawns. It also prevented white from getting doubled rooks on the c-file which could give him a significant positional advantage.

784,31,46,4Kc4,b'8/5p2/7p/7P/ppk3P1/8/1K2N3/8 w - -',A final careless move I needed to play f6 to prevent whites next (and winning) move.

786,31,48,4h7,b'8/5p1P/8/6p1/pp6/3k4/1K2N3/8 b - -',White has no need to protect the knight he will promote the pawn next move and mop up my pawns easily. A good lesson never get too focused on one section of the board causing you to forget another I had chances to force a draw and failed as i ignored my kingside.
787,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I chose to anotate this game for instructive purposes. 
788,32,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Much like the French defence the Caro-kann defence is aimed at 
playing the move d7-d5. This will force white to make a decision sooner or later wether to move his e-pawn forward defend it or exchange.
"
789,32,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"This is the exchange variation of the Caro-kann. 
As pointed out at the previous note white could've also played 3.Nc3 or 3.e5. 
But unlike other exchange variations ( like in the French Defence ) the Caro-kann exchange variation doesn't lead to a rather lifeless simplified position. Instead the more modern approach to this exchange variation can lead to more complicated play then other variations of the Caro-kann.
"
790,32,3,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"! The Panov-Botwinnik attack. 4.Bd3 or 4.Nf3 does lead to simpel play with more drawing chances and so the textmove is an energetic attempt to keep the advantage. This position can also be reached in other openings. 
With the textmove white risks an isolated pawn ( 4...dxc4 ) but white then gets obvious space advantage and lead in development as compensation."

White is slightly better as shown by 6. ... Bg4 7.Nc3! Bxf3 8.gxf3 Qxd4 9.Qxd4 Nxd4 10.Nb5! ( I suggest you check out the Game DB for this position! )"
792,32,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A solid move but still white has slight advantage.

This appears to be in preparation for Nd2 contesting the knight on f3.  However it's almost never a good idea to retreat a piece to it's original square.
