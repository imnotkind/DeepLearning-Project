0,0,0,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',"This signifies the Grob Attack an opening with which Basman is considered an expert.  In fact a case could be made that Basman is THE expert in this opening.
	Not much literature has been published on the Grob.  The most in depth book has been written by Basman expanding on ideas of Henry Grob himself.  While I’ve never played the Grob I have played against and been beaten by it (but then I’m better at analyzing games than actually playing them…).  The main appeal is probably its ability to surprise your opponent.  I know I certainly was.  In amateur or speed chess it can be an effective tool to take the game into territory with which your opponent is not familiar but at higher levels black will with sound play most likely to be able to exploit white’s lack of development and the space which has been conceded.
	While it does not hinder the development of the king’s knight it unnecessarily weakens the f4 square which can become a target for black.  Also the move does nothing to release the bishops or queen and does not stake claim to the center.  In other words there are “better” moves for white.
"
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',One of two standard responses by black the other being 1. …d4.  I believe 1. …e5 to be superior for a few reasons.  First it’s a solid move attacking the center not hindering the knights etc all according to classical opening theory.  Second it directly attacks f4 the square weakened by white’s first move.  The third reason is slightly more subtle.  White plans to put a bishop on g2 which will take dead aim at d5.  By delaying moving the d-pawn to d5 black robs white’s bishop of a potential target.
2,0,2,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/6P1/7P/PPPPPP2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Standard Grobbish practice or so I’ve read.  Protecting the pawn which will come under attack when black decides to move the d-pawn.  Premature prophylaxis due to a self imposed poor opening choice.  2. h3 does little for development although moving the pawn to h3 is often desirable in many openings due to it’s preventative nature.
3,0,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/6P1/7P/PPPPPP2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',With his second move black has obtained a classic pawn center and released both bishops and the queen.  Black’s lead in development and space while only two moves old is significant.
4,0,4,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/6P1/7P/PPPPPPB1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White’s plan is taking shape.  The light squared bishop will hopefully be a powerful sentinel stationed ominously at his post but it’s too early to tell at this point.  White’s position is not terrible but again white could have done better.  (Crafty gives black about half a pawn at this point)
5,0,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/6P1/7P/PPPPPPB1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black calmly continues his development.
6,0,6,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2P3P1/7P/PP1PPPB1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq c3',This is white’s first aggressive move that has practical applications.  He exerts additional pressure on d5.  He hopes to either draw black further out (if black plays the pawn to d4) or to bust up black’s powerful center by offering the c-pawn.  If black is drawn out further he will weaken his control on the central light squares and also allow white to thrust a spike into the center by moving a pawn to e4.  If white is then further allowed to close off the center he will have a formidable wedge on the QS.  This would diminish the power of the bishop on g2 but he still has the dark square bishop which he can operate successfully outside the pawn wedge.
7,0,7,dxc4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2p3P1/7P/PP1PPPB1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black accepts the c-pawn confident that his lead in development and extra pawn will compensate for his giving up his powerful pawn center.
8,0,8,Qa4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/Q1p3P1/7P/PP1PPPB1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',A scary looking move but one that is easily thwarted.  He effects a pin on the knight while at the same time attacking the wayward pawn on c4.  Black’s e-pawn is now undefended but the threat is not immediate as white is at least a tempo away from attacking the it.  Black can calmly address the issue.
9,0,9,Nge7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/4p3/Q1p3P1/7P/PP1PPPB1/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Preparing Ng6 which serves to develop the knight as well as protect the e-pawn.  Black seeks to remain a tempo ahead.  This move is also superior to Nf6 because there remains the threat of  6. g5 forcing the knight away.  This is pretty much the only advantage white has gained over black with his first move.
10,0,10,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/4p3/Q1p3P1/5N1P/PP1PPPB1/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Solid development and attacks the e-pawn.
11,0,11,Ng6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n3n1/4p3/Q1p3P1/5N1P/PP1PPPB1/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Stations the knight on a decent if not ideal square and protects the e-pawn.  Also threatens Nf4 which is weakened and attacks the bishop on g2 on the shoulders of whom white rests many hopes.
12,0,12,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n3n1/4p3/Q1p3P1/2N2N1P/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Blocking the c-pawn which black may have sent into the defenses as a battering ram to smash up white’s KS pawn structure which would prove more beneficial due to the fact that white’s QS structure is already suspect.  Also this attacks the two important squares d5 and e4 which the gambit of the c-pawn has weakened for black.
13,0,13,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4p3/Q1p3P1/2N2N1P/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',A solid centralizing move.  Black defends the c-pawn now that the prospect of the battering ram is put on hold.  This also fights for some of the light squares.
14,0,14,h4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4p3/Q1p3PP/2N2N2/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Preparing to move the knight to g5 which is a good square for him but again harkening back to the opening white has forced this turn of events.  Any sort of fluidity and see-where-the-game-goes has been lost and white is forced to attack the QS even if it’s not the best way to proceed.
15,0,15,Bb4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4p3/Qbp3PP/2N2N2/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Injecting the bishop into the opponents KS and somewhat forcing white’s e-pawn to stay home.  The knight is the only defender of the queen and moving the e-pawn pins it to the king.  Miles can afford to be aggressive here.
16,0,16,Ng5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4p1N1/Qbp3PP/2N5/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Getting the knight to its best post given the position and putting pressure on black’s light squared bishop.
17,0,17,Bd7,b'r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2n3n1/4p1N1/Qbp3PP/2N5/PP1PPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Calmly retreating the bishop.  The knight still eyes f7 however white’s other pieces are not sufficiently coordinated to make this threat debilitating.
18,0,18,1Bd5,b'r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/Qbp3PP/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',White finds arguably the only other weakness (aside from f7) and places his bishop proudly on e5.  The only nuisance the bishop could feel is if the c-pawn is suddenly freed.  Given that moving the knight will unleash a discovered attack on the queen and that the knight has a perfectly good square to which to move (d4) this scenario might not be as far off as white is hoping.  In terms of time this does force black to take care of the ugly proposition of Nxf7 losing the exchange.
19,0,19,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/Qbp3PP/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',The threat of Nxf7 is effectively neutralized with this natural move.  Even if white were to take on f7 then after 11. Nxf7 Rxf7 12. Bxf7+ Kxf7 both of white’s best placed pieces will have been eliminated and black still stands a pawn up.
20,0,20,1Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/1bp3PP/2N5/PPQPPP2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Basman retreats his queen and places her on the b1-h7 diagonal where she is much more powerful although her pressure is indirect.  White’s attack has fizzled and he has no immediate targets with which he can threaten black.
21,0,21,1Bxg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/1bp3bP/2N5/PPQPPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',One of the downsides of the failed attack is that the g pawn was made undefended by the h4 push.  Seeing no reason not to Miles sends his bishop to gobble up the wayward pawn.
22,0,22,1Qe4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/1bp1Q1bP/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',An anemic threat at best.  Black’s light squared bishop has too many comfortable escape squares for this to be bothersome.  White’s queen is now however better centralized but black’s powerful e-pawn handicaps her quite a bit.  Again this harkens back to the opening choice; black was able to place the pawn there because white didn’t address the possibility that he would.
23,0,23,1Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n3n1/3Bp1N1/1bp1Q2P/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',With its mission accomplished the bishop happily retreats.
24,0,24,1Nxh7,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppN/2n3n1/3Bp3/1bp1Q2P/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Perhaps a desperate ploy by white but the attack to the rook is real enough.
25,0,25,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppN/6n1/3Bp3/1bpnQ2P/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Miles completely ignores the threat to the rook and instead begins an attack of his own.
26,0,26,1h5,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppN/6n1/3Bp2P/1bpnQ3/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The intent of this move is clear but in retrospect as is the case with most things the real drawback of this move can bee seen…
27,0,27,1Nf4,b'r2q1rk1/pppb1ppN/8/3Bp2P/1bpnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',It seems that both Basman and Miles missed the insidious Bf5! which forces the white queen of the board.  14. …Bf5! (and the queen is trapped.  If 15.  Qe3 then 15. …Nc2+ forks the king queen and a rook!) 15. Qxf5 Nxf5 16. hxg6 leaves black up a piece and a pawn.  The only way to save the queen is 15. Qg2 which Basman probably could have taken his chances with but after 15. …Nf4 black’s attack is devastating.
28,0,28,1Nxf8,b'r2q1Nk1/pppb1pp1/8/3Bp2P/1bpnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White takes the rook evening his chances slightly.  He now has his guns trained on the black king’s position.
29,0,29,1Qxf8,b'r4qk1/pppb1pp1/8/3Bp2P/1bpnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black takes back and needs to consolidate here or at least not allow white further into the territory.
30,0,30,1Kd1,b'r4qk1/pppb1pp1/8/3Bp2P/1bpnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R b - -',I’m not really sure the purpose of this move.  It almost seems like a waiting move to see if black weakens himself at all.
31,0,31,1Re8,b'4rqk1/pppb1pp1/8/3Bp2P/1bpnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R w - -',Miles again misses the Bf5 attack.  He brings his last big gun to the party but it will require some maneuvering before it can be effective.
32,0,32,1Bxc4,b'4rqk1/pppb1pp1/8/4p2P/1bBnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R b - -',Basman snatches at the loose pawn.  Much better would have been Rg1 getting the at-this-point useless rook involved in the scuffle.
33,0,33,1Bc6,b'4rqk1/ppp2pp1/2b5/4p2P/1bBnQn2/2N5/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R w - -',A menacing looking skewer but white has a ready reply.
34,0,34,1Nd5,b'4rqk1/ppp2pp1/2b5/3Np2P/1bBnQn2/8/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R b - -',Of the two ways to break the skewer this may be the more appealing one.  Either way the interposing piece will be lost to Nxd5 and apparently Basman feels his chances of counterplay are better with the bishop rather than the knight.  In all fairness his chances look bleak either way.  Barring a major misplay by Miles Basman’s attack has virtually collapsed.
35,0,35,1Qc5,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2qNp2P/1bBnQn2/8/PP1PPP2/R1BK3R w - -',The dagger in the heart of the white defenses.  White cannot defend both the bishop and the knight.
36,0,36,1d3,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2qNp2P/1bBnQn2/3P4/PP2PP2/R1BK3R b - -',Saving the bishop at least but creating a dangerous weakness around the king and with both knight roaming dangerously close the weakness’s exploitability is heightened.
37,0,37,1Nxd5,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2qnp2P/1bBnQ3/3P4/PP2PP2/R1BK3R w - -',Getting rid of the interloper and threatening a discovered skewer on the white queen.
38,0,38,2Rg1,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2qnp2P/1bBnQ3/3P4/PP2PP2/R1BK2R1 b - -',The true last ditch attempt to attack black’s KS position and breaking the potential skewer.  It is I fear too late for white however.
39,0,39,2Nf4,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2q1p2P/1bBnQn2/3P4/PP2PP2/R1BK2R1 w - -',It’s hard to give this move a “?” seeing as how it’s not a bad move but black had a much more devastating move at his disposal:  Ba4+!  After 21. b3 Nc3+! (utilizing the weaknesses incurred by the d3 and b3 moves.  The hole at c3 is enormous) and the queen falls.  The move as it stands is by no means a blunder or even a bad move just not the best.
40,0,40,2Qe3,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2q1p2P/1bBn1n2/3PQ3/PP2PP2/R1BK2R1 b - -',The only move that saves the queen.
41,0,41,2Ndxe2,b'4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2b5/2q1p2P/1bB2n2/3PQ3/PP2nP2/R1BK2R1 w - -',"And black resigns.  He will lose the rook which held all of his counter attacking chances and the bishop will fall soon after.


I think the lesson that can best be taken from this match is: Unsound openings are unsound for a reason.  Even in the hands of an expert in the opening against proper play more often than not the strengths the opening allows the opponent will be too great to overcome.  Of course there will be exceptions like the Karpov-Miles match but in order to overcome the weaknesses it helps to play like Tony Miles!

42,1,0,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',We play the Fried Liver game. My opponent accepts it.

47,1,5,1Nc3,b'r4b1r/ppp4p/2n1kp2/4p3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I decide to develop my knight.

49,1,7,1d3,b'r6r/ppp4p/2n1kp2/4p3/1b6/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I let him take it which was probably a slight mistake. My knight was stronger than his bishop and get doubled pawns.

82,2,20,1Bxe3,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p1qpbn1p/1p2p3/1P2P3/P1NPbN1P/2P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I seize the chance to get rid of his last Bishop and swap off my KB.

92,2,30,2Qh5,b'r4rk1/2p2pp1/p1qp3p/1p1n1P1Q/1P1Pp3/P3P2P/2P3P1/R4RK1 b - -',In a word no. But I'm still up a piece and the White KP is hanging.

94,2,32,g6,b'r4r2/2p2p1k/p1qp2pp/1p1n1P1Q/1P1Pp1P1/P3P2P/2P5/R4RK1 w - -',If White exchanges Pawns I could possibly get rid of a pair of Rooks...

96,2,34,Nxe3,b'r4r2/2p4k/p1qp2pp/1p6/1P1Pp1PQ/P3n2P/2P5/R4RK1 w - -',Might as well get a passed Pawn while I have a chance.
97,2,35,2Rf6,b'r4r2/2p4k/p1qp1Rpp/1p6/1P1Pp1PQ/P3n2P/2P5/R5K1 b - -',White tries to gin up an attack.
98,2,36,2Rxf6,b'r7/2p4k/p1qp1rpp/1p6/1P1Pp1PQ/P3n2P/2P5/R5K1 w - -',I naturally take the opportunity to swap down.
99,2,37,Qe8,b'r3q3/2p4k/p2p1Qpp/1p6/1P1Pp1P1/P3n2P/2P5/R5K1 w - -',As long as I can keep White's QR from coordinating with the Queen I should be able to repulse the attack.

111,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a really long game. 54 moves in total. We both made mistakes. Overall we played pretty much the same. I hope you take the time to read all of this. My longest annotated game so far! :)

Yet Black does have some long-term prospects based upon the long dark diagonal - White's centre is far from invulnerable placed as it is - and the open files on the distant Queen's flank.  There are some resemblances here to the Benko and Blumenfeld Counter-gambits that White has to bear in mind.  White should also beware  - or be aware - of the long white diagonal (a8-h1) as well.  Finally there is that tension between e5 and d6 which neither is willing for the time being to resolve.  Having said all that 10.Be2 might have been simpler...

Generally speaking rooks aren't ideal blockading pieces - a task that tends to write down their value more than somewhat.  But Black lacks alternative resources to keep the pawns under restraint.  He certainly doesn't want to divert his best piece the knight for the purpose.  On the other hand White looks to have slender means of exploiting the tying down of Black's rooks.  In what follows White is merely probing looking for a weakness.  It would be long before he found one...

Possibly Black hoped to achieve something of interest on the weakened light squares around White's King maybe it was merely to render White's K-side pawns a little less mobile.

This Q-manoeuvre would have been better played a move earlier as Black could now it seems have got away with snatching the b-pawn: 23...Nxb4! 24.Rab1 Nd5 25.Rxb5 Qxb5  26.Qxb5 cxb5  27.Rc8+ Kg7  28.Rb8 and White can't quite recover the pawn.

As earlier foreshadowed for much of the remainder of the game - until the ending was reached - I kept looking for attack on one wing being stymied and switching my attention to the other.  It is possible that Black felt like a tennis player being given the runaround but a lot of it was pretty 'ad hoc' on my part probing for a weakness.

444,14,34,3Rb1,b'r5k1/1q3pb1/2pp3p/P4Q2/3PR3/5NP1/7P/1r2R1K1 w - -',(!) Putting a crimp in White's attack.  Off come a pair of rooks.  But White uses the moment to switch back to Q-side.  For the moment there's nothing doing on the King's flank.

449,14,39,3Qb5,b'q4rk1/1R3pb1/3p3p/PQp5/3P4/5NP1/7P/6K1 b - -',White looks for all the world to have been entirely committed to the Q-side all along.  With the advanced outside passed pawn and the rook on the seventh White looks very well placed but Black's pawn couple has something to say to the matter and although very defensively placed Black isn't leaving many weaknesses to exploit.
450,14,40,3Bxd4+,b'q4rk1/1R3p2/3p3p/PQp5/3b4/5NP1/7P/6K1 w - -',Alternatively: 36...c4 or 36...cxd4.  With this raid Black is now a pawn ahead and his pawn couple becomes passed.  As the 'pure' major piece ending looked unpromising White keeps the minor pieces on - a hard decision especially when you consider the relative locations of White King and Black queen!

I thought I had a bit of an edge but enough to convert to a win?  I took several days not even looking at the position thinking about it.  But then I recalled Freddy's policy of playing it down to the last resource and a small thought occurred to me.  If Freddy is offering a draw then in Freddy's opinion Black's game ain't looking so good.

In view of what was approaching I wondered if Black would try 52...Re8 with the idea of presenting some technical problems while he still had a couple of pawns one on the brink of promotion to play with.
470,14,60,5c1=B,b'2r4k/8/5R1p/8/7P/6P1/4N1K1/2b5 w - -',Low cunning and a wry sense of humour.  Of course White takes regardless.  
471,14,61,5Rd6,b'8/6k1/3R4/8/7P/6P1/6K1/2r5 b - -',Before continuing it is the sort of sequence that began with White's 47th move that shows how far ahead a forcing line allows you to 'see'.  After receiving Black's 46th move I had worked out the whole line to here within two or three minutes.  This ending is easily winning for White simply because the King and Rook are so ideally placed for a rook ending of this type.  The Black King is confined and can do nothing but wait for the action to come to him.  At least he's not cut off on the Q-side.  
472,14,62,5Kh3,b'8/6k1/3R4/8/7P/6PK/2r5/8 b - -',Getting cover from the checks.  I play this ending very conservatively - no flourishes.
473,14,63,5Rc5,b'8/6k1/3R4/2r5/7P/6PK/8/8 w - -',Whether or not this is best I figured Black would play it.  White wants to play h4-h5 then bring the g-pawn up followed by the King (depending on the activities of the enemy rook).  Unable to play the h-pawn White is then tempted to play the g-pawn up.  But after 57.g4 Rc3+ White's King is also for the moment cut off.  Rather than examine too closely the technical problems associated with the pawn move the King advances instead.
474,14,64,5Kg4,b'8/6k1/3R4/2r5/6KP/6P1/8/8 b - -',(!) 
475,14,65,5Rc7,b'8/2r3k1/3R4/8/6KP/6P1/8/8 w - -',(?) A surprise.  I was expecting something like this: 57...Rc4+  58.Kf5 (58.Kf3 is probably as good if not better) ...Rc5+  59.Ke4 ... (preparing to cover the nect check with 60.Rd4 with 61.g4 to follow) 59...Rh5  60.Rd5 Rh6  61.h5.  
476,14,66,Rg7+,b'6k1/6r1/3R4/6KP/8/6P1/8/8 w - -',(?) Totally out of the blue.  I'm guessing that Freddy decided to play 'second best' moves either in the hope I'd play 'routinely' into a bad line or looking for a stalemate.  But the pawn ending was even more hopeless than the rook ending.
477,14,67,6Rg6,b'6k1/6r1/6R1/6KP/8/6P1/8/8 b - -',The pawn ending is the simplest way to go.
478,14,68,6g4,b'8/6k1/8/6KP/6P1/8/8/8 b - -',(!)  A casual glance at the GK notes on this game will reveal that this was inferior to 62.h6+.  Even if that were true I'd still play this advance adhering to the principle of keeping the pawns together.  Only in special circumstances should the one abandon his comrade for the glory of promotion.  But ... just check out the next couple of GK notes ... :)  Yes 62.g4 is the best move.
479,14,69,6g5+,b'8/8/5K1k/6PP/8/8/8/8 b - -',I did consider 64.Kf7 but this is simplest and straightforward.
480,14,70,6Kh7,b'8/7k/5K2/6PP/8/8/8/8 w - -',Of course ...Kxh5 deprived Black with even the smallest hope of a Stalemate.
481,14,71,Kg8,b'6k1/8/5KP1/7P/8/8/8/8 w - -',White has a forced mate but 65...Kh8 would have prolonged the game by one move.
482,14,72,7Qh4#,b'8/5K2/7k/8/7Q/8/8/8 b - -',(# 1-0)  Of course 70.Qg6 was also mate but I have a fondness for this constellation.  This was my first ever win against  id=easy19 after two draws and I've lost count how many losses.  It also brought me to within the half-point of the MT winner.  This win almost - almost - made up for the disappointing loss with the Black pieces...

I really did think the lines opened up would be of more use to Black than to White but that belief was to prove unfounded.  But all this was in fact a change of mind.

E.g. 23.Na4 Nb3  24.Qf2 Nc5  25.Nxc5 dxc5; or possibly less OK for Black: 20.Nxd3 cxb4  21.axb4  Be6  22.Bb3 Nd4  23.Ba2 Bxc4  24.Bxc4 Qxc4  25.e5 (...dxe5; fxe5).

This pawn was so far away what could it achieve?  But the more I looked at the sequel - and my planned ...Kf8 was still the best I could find - I played the move with the conviction that somewhere somehow I had thrown away a decent-sized advantage and my opponent now had control of the game.  But there was a further surprise in store.  When I ran this game through the GK engine it called this pawn advance an inaccuracy indicating that Black had the whisker of an edge!  This has to be 'horizon effect'.  My misjudgement was in assessing Black's defensive resources.

557,17,37,Qb1+,b'5bR1/3rk3/p4pQ1/2p1pP1B/2P5/P2p4/8/1q3K2 w - -',Black has to find counterplay.  Passive defence offers no hope.

I had intended to play 44...Qb8 and thought I had played it hitting the submit button before I noticed the slip of the mouse.  The idea was 44...Qb8  45.Qf7+ Kd6  46.Qe6+ Kc7 and if 47.Rxf8 Qb2+ and pray for a miracle.

So disappointed was I at this result (though not specifically at that aberrant 47th move) that I just didn't want to look at this game for a long time afterward.  I'm still not sure what to make of it...

White builds up an imposing centre that Black brings at once under pressure.

In my view the situation calls for it so strongly it is hard to contemplate playing anything else.  Later id=easy19 was to try the little-known 6...b5 against me.

But instead 8.dxc5 was possible: 8...Ng3 9.Rg1 Bxc3+! 10.bxc3 Nxe4 11.cxd6 exd6 12.Be3 Re8 13.Qe2 Bf5 with an evenish game.  Both sides would have been left with weaknesses to be exploited.  Also 8.Be3!? exd4 9.Bxd4 e5  10.fxe5 Ng3  11.Rg1 Nc6  12.Bf2 Nxf1  13.exd6 Be6  14.Nd5 f5.

I surmise that White wanted to protect the c-pawn as well and simply overlooked the dark-square Bishop lurking away there at g7.  But after 16.Qd2 Black would probably have quietly taken the rook at b1.

This miniature shows what can happen if White neglects development in this line.  His centre was destroyed and became Black's exclusive property...

I prefer the text move myself because it makes it more likely we will transpose into my favourite Two Knights Defence but it turns out that my opponent has something altogether different in mind....
913,31,2,Bxf7+,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',TN. (Although there is a known opening with this idea the Jerome Gambit if anyone wants to look it up.) White gives up a whole piece to tear open the Black king's pawn cover. This is certainly dangerous but instinctively I feel it must be unsound; White has not enough pieces developed to organise an attack. It's true that Black is not yet developed either but that gives Black the advantage of flexibility. For instance since Black has not moved the king's knight he can respond to Qf3+ with Qf6 -- and the last thing White wants is to exchange queens.
914,31,3,d3,b'r1bq1bnr/pppp1kpp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQ -',So White to play and justify his gambit. As just stated Qf3+ doesn't work and nor does Qh5+; Black just plays g6 and there's no follow-up. White's only recourse is to develop his pieces rapidly with this move and Nf3 in either order to prepare Ng5+.
915,31,4,Be7,b'r1bq3r/ppppbkpp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',"Black meanwhile prepares to ""castle by hand"". Once he plays Rf8 then Ng5+ will have no impact except for losing tempo for White."
916,31,5,O-O,b'r1bq3r/ppppbkpp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',"But White chooses to castle instead. ""Do not castle except when strictly necessary for the initiative is often lost by it."" That said Ng5+ at this point is really no more than a mild inconvenience to Black -- showing I think that Black has already refuted White's sacrifice. Black would respond with moves such as Ke8 Rf8 d6 and the king is safe enough in the centre while White's having given Black a half-open file could actually work in Black's favour."

This move doesn't achieve much at all because the queenside pawns are ""flat"" and there's no real chance yet for either side to break through there."
918,31,7,Kg8,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4p3/P3P3/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Now Black's king is safe and Black is a piece up. GameKnot scores this as +3.5 to Black: in other words the attacking possibilities of the half-open f-file are worth more than the missing pawn.

921,31,10,1Nb5,b'r1b1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/1N2p3/P3P3/3P1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White notices that in my single-minded focus on h3 I've left c7 undefended.

Qg6 11. Nxc7 Bxh3 White has 12. Nh4! so I may as well just keep everything defended for now and continue to build up my attack.
923,31,12,Nh5,b'r1bbqrk1/ppp3pp/2np4/1N2p2n/P3P3/3P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So that my bishop prevents Nh4. Mind you the move is not exactly subtle...

(Though GameKnot thinks this increases Black's advantage by a third of a pawn and 12... a6 gives it back again so did I miss something?) Now the straightforward Qg6 Bxh3 is prevented but I decide to proceed with my Qg6 plan anyway on the optimistic basis that getting several attackers in the vicinity of the White king may lead to an opportunity to break through.
925,31,14,1Nd5,b'r1bb1rk1/1pp3pp/p1np2q1/3Np2n/P3P3/3P1N1P/1PPB1PPK/R2Q1R2 b - -',White has lost a lot of time with this knight but it's not clear that Black has made the best use of it. I spent a long time over my next move eventually deciding that the best way to proceed was to threaten exchanges leaving both the possibilities of a winning attack and a winning endgame open without gunning for either approach exclusively.
926,31,15,1Nd4,b'r1bb1rk1/1pp3pp/p2p2q1/3Np2n/P2nP3/3P1N1P/1PPB1PPK/R2Q1R2 w - -',With the threat of 15... Nxf3+ forcing White to recapture with the pawn and weaken his kingside. The move also vacates c6 so I can kick White's knight and in doing so open a line for my bishop to reach the g1-a7 diagonal where it would add pressure to the pawn on f2.
927,31,16,1Nxd4,b'r1bb1rk1/1pp3pp/p2p2q1/3Np2n/P2NP3/3P3P/1PPB1PPK/R2Q1R2 b - -',White decides to take the exchange on d4. Now Black's pawn will block the g1-a7 diagonal but it also takes away the d5 knight's retreat...
928,31,17,1g4,b'r1bb1rk1/1pp3pp/p2p2q1/3N3n/P2pP1P1/3P3P/1PPB1P1K/R2Q1R2 b - g3',...so White immediately responds by kicking my knight. I get an exchange which should be in my favour but my attacking prospects are being rapidly whittled away.

931,31,20,1c3,b'r1b2rk1/1pp3pp/p2p2q1/8/P2pPPPb/2PP3P/1P1B3K/R2Q1R2 b - -',Instead White decides to increase the scope of his own bishop.

933,31,22,Qf7,b'r1b2rk1/1pp2qpp/p2p4/5P2/P3P1Pb/1QpP3P/1P1B3K/R4R2 w - -',And if White is going to offer me a chance to swap queens you bet I'm going to take it.
934,31,23,Bd7,b'r5k1/1ppb1rpp/p2p4/5P2/P3P1Pb/2BP3P/1P5K/R4R2 w - -',It's time for my queen's bishop and rook to get out; neither of them has moved yet this game.
935,31,24,Re8,b'4r1k1/1ppb1rpp/p2p4/5P2/P2PP1Pb/2B4P/1P5K/R4R2 w - -',Now White's pawns seem to be under control and White cannot even back them up with Rae1 as my bishop controls that square. At this point I still thought it would be an easy win. What's notable about this game is that even though I get the piece advantage early on I never seem to be able to make much use of it and yet I'm not making any huge mistakes; indeed GameKnot's analysis labels only FOUR moves as mistakes in the entire game of which one is 3. Bxf7+ and two come after the contest was really over!
936,31,25,Bc6,b'4r1k1/1pp2rpp/p1b5/4PP2/P5Pb/2B4P/1P5K/R4R2 w - -',So White has a passed pawn now and I have to duck to avoid the fork e6. Still those advanced pawns should be easy to undermine and pick off with my superior piece power shouldn't they?
937,31,26,Rff8,b'4rrk1/1pp3pp/p1b1P3/5P2/P5Pb/2B4P/1P5K/R4R2 w - -',And not 27... Rfe7?? 28. Bb4 and the rook is trapped!
938,31,27,2Bb4,b'4rrk1/1pp3pp/p1b1P3/5P2/PB4Pb/7P/1P5K/R4R2 b - -',White forces off the bishops so that Rae1 can be played. (Black's plan is to play g6 undermining the pawns; if f6 Rxe6; Rae1 would prevent this.)
939,31,28,3b3,b'5rk1/1pp1r1pp/p1b1P3/5P2/P5P1/1P5P/7K/R4R2 b - -',However this must be played first to free the a1 rook from defensive duties...
940,31,29,3g6,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p1b1P1p1/5P2/P5P1/1P5P/7K/R4R2 w - -',...and that means Black has the chance to get this move in first.
941,31,30,3Rad1,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p1b1P1p1/5P2/P5P1/1P5P/7K/3R1R2 b - -',I think this is better than Rae1 now. The d7 square becomes an important factor.
942,31,31,Be4,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p3P3/5P2/P3b3/1P5P/7K/3R1R2 w - -',(?) Too hasty. I thought this move won the advanced pawns overlooking White's reply. Note that if 33. f6 Rxe6 34. Rae1 Black can escape the pin by Bd5. GameKnot marks this as a mistake favouring 32... Kg7 a more patient move that probably would lead to winning the pawns.
943,31,32,3Rd4,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p3P3/5P2/P2Rb3/1P5P/7K/5R2 b - -',(!) Now Black's in trouble.
944,31,33,3Bxf5,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p3P3/5b2/P2R4/1P5P/7K/5R2 w - -',Now 33... Bc2 is met by 34. Rd7 while 33... Bc6 is insipid. White can double the rooks and Black will find it difficult or impossible to win the pawns. I felt my best hope now was to exchange my bishop for the pawns remaining a pawn ahead and try to win the rook ending. According to GameKnot my advantage has decreased to +1.28.
945,31,34,3Rdf4,b'5rk1/1pp1r2p/p3P3/5b2/P4R2/1P5P/7K/5R2 b - -',I had seen this coming. Black must take the second pawn and abandon the bishop.
946,31,35,Rxf5,b'6k1/1pp4p/p3r3/5r2/P7/1P5P/7K/5R2 w - -',Exchanging one pair of rooks gains a vital tempo for Black.
947,31,36,Re3,b'6k1/1pp4p/p7/5R2/P7/1P2r2P/7K/8 w - -',Now I felt I might still be winning after all. If I can gain a second pawn without losing one I should win; and how can White defend b3?
948,31,37,Re4,b'6k1/1pp4p/p7/5R2/PP2r3/7P/7K/8 w - -',"Back at move 32 when GameKnot flagged Be4 as a mistake it predicted the subsequent moves up to this point and then gave 37... Ra3. From the human standpoint though this move is much better. After 37... Ra3 White saves the pawns with 38. a5. After the move played he can still save the pawns but... ""the move is there but you must see it."" (And I missed it completely; White's next took me totally by surprise.)"
949,31,38,3Rc5,b'6k1/1pp4p/p7/2R5/PP2r3/7P/7K/8 b - -',(!!) One of the most stunning and paradoxical moves I've ever seen played against me. If 38. b5 then Black avoids exchanging on b5 and instead wins with Rxa4. Yet b5 is the right idea -- it just needs to be prepared by first forcing Black to add an extra defender to that square!
950,31,39,3c6,b'6k1/1p5p/p1p5/2R5/PP2r3/7P/7K/8 w - -',I had now seen 39. b5 but there is no alternative to this move.
951,31,40,3Rg5+,b'6k1/1p5p/p1p5/6R1/PP2r3/7P/7K/8 b - -',(?) White misses it! Though after this move 40. b5 is still playable.
952,31,41,4Rg4,b'8/1p3k1p/p1p5/8/PP2r1R1/7P/7K/8 b - -',"(??) Not any more. Incidentally we see here a fundamental flaw in GameKnot's analysis technique. It doesn't flag this the game-losing blunder as even being a mistake. Why? Because the difference it makes is ""only"" 0.75 of a pawn (the other 0.25 of it being lost on the preceding move -- if White had found 40. b5 then the intervening check would have slightly improved Black's position by activating his king). Yet in the endgame it's all too easy for just one pawn to be the difference between a draw and a loss. After 40. b5 and the exchange of two pairs of pawns we have the notorious R+P v R endgame very difficult to play and very likely to be a draw."
953,31,42,4Rxg4,b'8/1p3k1p/p1p5/8/PP4r1/7P/7K/8 w - -',Black can't win a pawn but he can simplify into a won king and pawns endgame. If there's one lesson I'd like you to take away from this annotation it's this: ALWAYS calculate the king and pawns endgame before offering your opponent an opportunity to simplify into it! If it's a lost endgame it may also be lost with pieces on but at least you'll have more chance of your opponent making a mistake with pieces.
954,31,43,4g5,b'8/1p5p/p1p5/6P1/PPk2K2/8/8/8 b - -',(?) This blocks the only route White has to take h7 in three moves. After 44. Kg5 Kxb4 45. Kh6 c5 46. Kxh7 c4 47. g5 c3 48. g6 c2 49. g7 c1Q 50. g8Q Qh1+ 51. Kg7 Qg1+ Black wins -- this is the endgame I calculated before accepting the exchange of rooks -- but giving up tempi can only make it easier.
955,31,44,Qxg7+,b'7K/1p4q1/p7/8/Pk6/8/8/8 w - -',And this is the fourth and last move flagged by GameKnot as a mistake. In a sense it's right -- with both a-pawns removed 51... Qh2+ mates in 12 and I can't imagine that putting the a-pawns back on makes much difference to that -- but this came at a time when my opponent had been online for a while we were making moves rapidly and I wanted to get the game finished. More moves but much less thinking time needed this way!
956,31,45,b3,b'8/8/p7/8/k2K4/1p6/8/8 w - -',White gives up seeing that after 56. Kc3 Ka3 promotion cannot be prevented. Many thanks to my opponent; that was a very interesting game to play and I hope you found it just as interesting to read!

I feel it is an excellent choice for blitz play since WT must play precisely to keep an advantage which should then be a small one. Granted that some small inaccuracy will probably not damage WT to the point of losing as in more volatile Defenses such as the Dragon Sicilian. At the same time BL faces less tactical risk here but still has some chances to mix-it-up with tactics. These may often result in positions resembling a Caro-Kann; or strangely similar to a Goring Gambit Reversed(!) when the ...c6 gambit line is accepted as we see in this game. If the ...c6 gambit is offered but declined than it may well transpose to a line of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack of the Caro. 
959,32,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',exd5. What else?! While 2. e5 is certainly playable the disadvantages for gaining that bit of space are: #1 Unlike a French Defense BL can still develop his Bf5. #2 WT does not yet have a supporting pawn chain for the move such as d4 that BL could prevent by 2...d4 himself or he can immediately start to play against WT pawns being placed at e5 & d4 by 2...c5 now. Finally #3 WT used a tempo to push ahead to e5. We could also say a fourth thing being that BL gets a clearly defined game strategy against 2.e5 which will cost him some space but gives WT little chance for unexpected tactics. 
960,32,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I prefer 2....Nf6 here over Qxd5 since it keeps more options. And it also permits WT to play 3.c4!? or 3.Bb5+  both of which I dearly enjoy to play against. Vs the Bb5+ I usually play the mainline of ...Bd7 but find ...c6 an acceptible alternative for blitz play. Had WT played differently then the responses possible are largely why I defer 2...Qxd5. I do like the transposing Q capture vs 3.Nf3 or especially 3.d4 since the latter can put BL in a bit of a cramp later if he has played Nxd5 before Nc3 has been played.

I was introduced to it by a blitz opponent and tho I won that one it required all my alertness toward the task of surviving. And so I put it on my own list to try out. That is a large part of my philosophy about opening choices/moves/variation. I figure that if it gave Me enough trouble then it is worth seeing how others will fare with it. In other words if they are not just a clearly better player than I then they will have a heavy task set before them. I believe this is much the same stance taken by GM/WC Mikhail Tal in pursuit of his own tactical combinations. If He cannot find a refutation of his own sac/combination/continuation  then he defies the opponent to be a superior analyst. And THAT is not going to happen often to a Mikhail Tal. But if You or I did so yet lost ... well then we know how to handle that line the next time it gets played against us. So a Win situation even if a loss is taken~!

In other words you might say WT is ""asking for trouble"" so eyes wide open for your chances. The Elements: (1.)BL is +2 pieces ahead in development and maybe 3 since it is his move.
