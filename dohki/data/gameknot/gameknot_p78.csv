53,3,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I kick off with the always flexible English opening obviously at this point the game could progress in many different directions and this is one of the reasons I'm finding myself play this first move in a decent portion of my games these days. 
54,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Black responds by mirroring my first move some consider this line to be rather boring however I feel this to be far from the truth symmetrical English games can easily be full of excitement. Besides at this point the game can still progress down many different routes. The key idea behind both sides not yet committing to the centre is that often the openings can be something of a guessing game as both sides look to make several transpositions
55,3,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Breaking the symmetry these types of pawn formations can lead to dynamic interesting play since black is signalling that he intends to at some point play in the centre 
56,3,3,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I personally think this is more accurate than fianchettoing the bishop right away this knight immediately adds control to the central dark squares and allows me to meet 4...d5 with 5.cxd5 exd5 6.d4 cxd4 7.Nxd4 instead of having to recapture with the queen and potentially lose a tempo 
57,3,4,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',!? very interesting according to the database more common is ...b6 or Nc6 but at this point there really isn't any correct move I think compared to other more mainline openings this is position is comparatively unexplored and allows each player a lot of play. the gameKnot engine marks this for the moment as the first non book move
58,3,5,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',!? more common is apparently Bg2 which is perfectly alright it leads back to positions that have still been seen a fair bit although not as much as something like a ruy lopez or sicillian. I chose this move because on principle blacks just made a play on the wing so it makes sense to strike in the centre the other reason I chose this over Bg2 is because this move puts blacks idea to the test by striking earlier than white normally would it attempts to refute blacks idea.
59,3,6,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/8/2Pp4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5...b5!? was another way to go and immediately leads to a complex position I did look into it a bit but with so much to analyse I think I'll leave it to the reader to come up with their own opinions of that line
60,3,7,Qc7,b'rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',! by far the best move in my opinion. I feel like anything else allows white to keep playing for an advantage whereas with this black signals his intention to play to win. This move is the only one that applies pressure on white by immediately threatening to win material black makes it so white needs to react 
61,3,8,Bg2,b'rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Not willing to hand black the initiative I elect to sacrifice the pawn. In any case I dint really feel like there was a satisfactory way to protect the pawn. e3 would be terrible e4 would maybe be alright however white wishes to fianchetto so making that harder to achieve doesn't seem to wise Qd3 is probably the best way to defend however I didn't really think my queen belonged on d3. interestingly this move brings us back into the gameKnots opening book according to the engine I was aware that the position has still seen plenty of games in the database however I don't have access beyond the first seven moves so I was more or less making moves based off of my personal opinion and ideas.
62,3,9,Qxc4,b'rnb1kb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/8/2qN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',white offered the pawn black has no reason not to take it.
63,3,10,Nxc6,b'r1b1kb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1N1pn2/8/2q5/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Supposedly this takes us back out of book. It is a bit of a concession I admit having sacrificed a pawn I don't wont to be trading pieces so willingly especially my centralised developed knight. Yet on the other hand moving it else ware seems like a concession in time and there isn't a good way to defend it plus I feel as though the pawn formation black will be left with will make it hard to coordinate and activate his pieces in particular by closing the c file I can probably gain some time making the black queen a little uncomfortable. Not that moving the knight would be bad both Nc2 and Nf3 were also worth considering
64,3,11,1Bf4,b'r1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/p1p1pn2/8/2q2B2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',! Simple but strong. I immediately place plenty of pressure on the dark squared f4-b8 diagonal this does a number of things it stops the rook making use of b8 and more importantly I'm looking at the d6 square as I would love to stick a bishop there thus creating a bind over black and preventing him from castling. Another key point of this move is that it clears away the c1 square which is where my rook belongs so it can be more active and making life uncomfortable for the black queen. 
65,3,12,1d5,b'r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/2q2B2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq d6',Black wisely prevents any nonsense on d6
66,3,13,1Rc1,b'r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/2q2B2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',strong square for the rook I get to apply pressure against the queen and down the important c file where I'm targeting the weak c6 pawn and just as importantly the weak c5 square
67,3,14,1a3,b'r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/1q3B2/P1N3P1/1P2PPBP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',Also possible is Qc2 however I felt it prudent to continue to harass the black queen. If now 12...Qxb2? 13.Na4! Qb7 (13..Qxa3?! 14.Nb6) 14.Rb1 Qa7 15.Nb6 and I'm definitely liking white
68,3,15,Be7,b'r1b1k2r/1q2bppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/5B2/P1N3P1/1PQ1PPBP/2R2RK1 w kq -',Preparing to castle

The truth is that this knight does an excellent job applying pressure to the dark squares b6 and c5 whilst also performing a good role of defending b2. Plus it unmasks my queen and rook on the undefended c6 square (though I'm not actually threatening to take it just yet.
70,3,17,1e4,b'r1b2rk1/1q2bppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/N3PB2/P5P1/1PQ2PBP/2R2RK1 b - e3',?! This is the only move in the game that I think is really suspect from a theoretical point of view it makes sense that I being the better developed side (whos also sacd material) should want to open up the position. However this causes me to give up my LSB which starts to make my position feel somewhat airy. Had I had this position again I think I would have gone with Rfd1 instead
71,3,18,1Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/1q2bppp/p1p1p3/3p4/N3nB2/P5P1/1PQ2PBP/2R2RK1 w - -',likely best
72,3,19,1Qxe4,b'r1b2rk1/1q2bppp/p1p1p3/8/N3QB2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R2RK1 b - -',And now visually we can see what losing our LSB is like it doesn't seem pretty. It's true that c6 is weak and c5 is an excellent square to make use of however I did concern myself just a little that black may find a way to give back a pawn (either the c or e pawn) inorder to activate his LSB which could prove very strong if the position was to open up in that manner. I made sure to keep this in mind for the next part of the game as I played with the intention of keeping blacks pieces in particular the LSB from getting activated 
73,3,20,1Qb5,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p1p1p3/1q6/N3QB2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R2RK1 w - -',Black vacates the b7 square evidently planning to make use of it with his LSB whilst at the same time the queen puts pressure on my Knight making it so I cant play b4 to clamp down on c5
74,3,21,1Rfd1,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p1p1p3/1q6/N3QB2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2RR2K1 b - -',a very important move I take the file while I can and get ready to meet Bb7
75,3,22,1Rd7,b'r4rk1/1b1Rbppp/p1p1p3/1q6/N3QB2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R3K1 b - -',! an essential move in my view this prevents c5 and continues to keep hold of the initiative. 
76,3,23,2Qc4,b'r3r1k1/1b1Rbppp/p1p1p3/1q6/N1Q2B2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R3K1 b - -',!? this is the only move throughout the game that the gameKNot engine marks as an inaccuracy The line it does provide starting with b4 does seem to be more complicated and although I certainly had considered 20.b4 I had seen that this move lead to a lot of lines that are nearly guaranteed to be drawn and as a draw would be a good result I felt this was the best course of action.
77,3,24,2Bc8,b'r1b1r1k1/3Rbppp/p1p1p3/1q6/N1Q2B2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R3K1 w - -',looking to get rid of the pesky rook on the seventh however white now implements a combination that essentially guarantees a drawn endgame
78,3,25,2Qxb5,b'r1b1r1k1/3Rbppp/p1p1p3/1Q6/N4B2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R3K1 b - -',or alternatively 21.Rxe3 first I liked this better though because it closes the b file

80,3,27,Bxa8,b'b5k1/4rppp/2p1p3/1p6/5B2/P5P1/1P3P1P/2R3K1 w - -',and now with the presences of opposite coloured bishops the ending is a clear draw. I chose to play on for a while more though simply because my opponent is stronger and has the extra material so I wait until I have 'proven the draw' before I offer one
81,3,28,2Rd1,b'b5k1/4rppp/2p1p3/1p6/5B2/P5P1/1P3P1P/3R2K1 b - -',! not only are the bishops of opposite colour around but I have the much more active pieces meaning I can't really go wrong.

84,3,31,2h4,b'b3r1k1/5pp1/2p1p2p/1p6/7P/P3B1P1/1P3P2/3R2K1 b - h3',?! Okay this move doesn't change anything about the result or the drawishness of the position I was thinking I'd first prevent g5 before I clamp down with Bc5 but if I got to thi position again I think I would play Bc5 just because in that case it is actually harder for black to play. Ofcourse the position is still a draw no matter what the only moves that change that would be if I lost a piece with Rd5?? Rd8?? Bg5?? or Bxh6??

Black's goal is to capture the knight on f3 and damage White's pawn structure. If I take with the e-pawn my d-pawn is now isolated.

White has a damaged pawn structure and a king in the center but also now has the two Bishops and more open lines for his pieces. In the end I decided to go the safe route

188,6,19,1Qd7,b'2r1k2r/pp1q1ppp/2b1p3/1B6/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w k -',Black's Queen escapes from the Rook on c1 and White will eventually have to move the Bishop on b5.

Though the tempo gain is temporary you will see quite a few of these kinds of moves from black in this game. The idea behind it is that white is forced to move a piece twice(the definition of poor piece placement and losing tempo). Only to have black develop another piece

Bb3. The rationale for this is that white's main idea is to play g2-g4-g5. Having the bishop on e2 supports that. furthermore many white players like placing a knight on b3 to contest the c5-strong point. 
514,17,9,1Qc7,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2pp1/p2ppn2/4n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I am currently badgering my club students about the importance of developing pieces over moving pawns. In the alternative white must commit to queen side castling before playing the ... b5 ideas For example if 10...b5? right now then  11. O-O-O Bb7 12. Bg5 Qa5 13. Kb1 Nc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15.

The Alternative 11...Be7 is just as strong if not stronger. But then again it does not give my opponent something to think about like 11...b5 does!

The rationale is that it improves the king's safety by getting him off the hotly contested c-file and allows the white pieces congested on the d-file a little freedom to unravel themselves. I suspect that white wants to setup a powerful battering ram along f2-h7 diagonal with Qf2.  It also will give the d1-rook strength along the d-file. 
517,17,12,1Nc4,b'r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/1p5p/2nNP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R w kq -',forcing white to give up the bishop pair. Which right now is not significant but it will be later on. Plus the pawn on c4 acts like a wedge in white's position making it difficult for him to free himself.  
518,17,13,bxc4,b'r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2pNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R w kq -',A player can not go on the offensive he is tripping over himself! Also I  have created a new opening along the b-file.

Qe3 Nd7 17. Bg5 Rb8 =. This by the way is a great example of how improving piece position before moving a pawn could have maybe lead white to the better line. However white wants to play g2-g4-g5. Something I can not stop effectively so I try to counter balance it with threats of my own.

The rationale is that it gains tempo by practically forcing white to defend the checkmate with Qc1. This puts the queen on a slightly inferior square. Though it still supports it's main duty of aiding the bishop on e3. If white chooses to defend the threat with 18.b3?! which is a positional blunder. He a created a lasting weakness on the dark diagonal.

Another plus is that it doubles black pawns on the c-file which is a big mess.  However the black c5 pawn dominates the only useable center square on the board. White only has a rook on the d-file at the moment so he can not make good use of the file.

554,18,5,1Bxe7,b'1n3rk1/4Bpbp/1r1q2p1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP3KPP/R2QR3 b - -',Working to recognize forks in advance clearly not there yet.
555,18,6,1Re2,b'1n3rk1/4Bpbp/3q2p1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/Pr2RKPP/R2Q4 b - -',He pins his rook for me. Phew.
556,18,7,2Re1,b'5rk1/5p1p/6p1/2pqN3/Qn6/8/PR3KPP/4R3 b - -',I see the possible fork at Nd3 but his e5 knight is defending that space.
557,18,8,2Kf2,b'5rk1/5p1p/6p1/1Qp1N3/1n6/2q5/P4KPP/4R3 b - -',This is where it dawned on me he might not see the potential fork.
558,18,9,2Rb8,b'1r4k1/5p1p/6p1/1Qp1N3/1n6/2q5/P4KPP/4R3 w - -',Analysis calls this a blunder but I think this was a pretty good move. He'll capture and then I move my king in between my pawns a Kg4 move will box my king in. If he doesn't see the fork Kg4 will be very attractive to white. I gambled and....
559,18,10,2Ng4,b'1Q6/5pkp/6p1/2p5/1n4N1/2q5/P4KPP/4R3 b - -',"...it pays off! (Note: My wife asked me what was wrong when I screamed out ""YES!)"
560,18,11,2Kg3,b'1Q6/5pkp/6p1/2p5/6N1/2qn2K1/P5PP/4R3 b - -',Surprised me he didn't move Ke2 but I'll take it.
561,18,12,Nxg2+,b'1Q6/5pkp/6p1/2p5/5KN1/2q5/P5nP/8 w - -',I found a mate path from here. I just need him to move...
562,18,13,3Kg5,b'1Q6/5pkp/6p1/2p3K1/6N1/2q5/P5nP/8 b - -',There!!
563,18,14,h5#,b'1Q6/5pk1/6p1/2p4p/6K1/4q3/P5nP/8 w - h6',I really enjoyed the opportunity Porcho! Thanks for setting up the mini tournament.
564,19,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So as usual I start off with the King's Pawn Opening.
565,19,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Because of his rating I had expected him to respond with the Sicilian.  But this response is fine and I am very accustomed to this as well.  Having said that with everything that is about to be played this opening will transpose into the King's Knight opening followed by the Ruy Lopez.
566,19,2,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Believe it or not I thought that he would continue with development by playing 3...Nf6 and then I would also develop and bring an extra piece for protection after 4.Nc3.  But this is a move that I kind of expected as well.  In these types of positions the opponent kicks the B.  I don't know why as it doesn't post as any threats at the moment.  But that is irrelevant because I know how to respond and the best outpost for this move.  That's because I have dealt with this situation against Jack Stockel so best is 4.Ba4 in this position.
567,19,3,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',At this point he is now interested in developing while attempting to force an exchange.  I could allow it but I choose not to.  The reason being is that I have had bad luck with NXP NXP.  Therefore I will refute this and develop even further with 5.Nc3.
568,19,4,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',And as I expected he decides to reattack my B.  Now the only outpost is 6.Bb3.
569,19,5,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So this is where he places his B.  If I were black I would have played 6...Bc5 because the Master Mater adviced me to and Mr. Arboite (the assistant coach of Jack Stockel at the time implied to) place your B where it covers the most squares (which is also why I was taught to fianchetto them).  For me that does not just apply for the midgame because the recommendation from Mr. Arboite applied during the beginning game.  However this move is perfectly fine and it won't make a difference because Jim and I are both going to castle Kingside on our next move.
570,19,6,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - d3',I remembered something that cdeburca said but applied it here as opposed to earlier.  In a different game I learned that if black's pawn only advances one square on his or her first move it's best to respond with d4.  Now although that didn't happen the position wound up becoming similar where both of our N's are out pretty similar to a reversed two Knights defense.  Therefore I decided to advance my d pawn as it should strengthen my position.  What's more interesting is that my choice is going to lead to an exchange variation.
571,19,7,c5,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p4n2/1pp5/3QP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - c6',He decides to attack my Q.  I understand that because that's what I might have played if I were black.  The question is however what does this accomplish?  
572,19,8,1Qe3,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p4n2/1pp5/4P3/1BN1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',?? In the meantime this is where I decide to retreat but according Jim this is the losing blunder.  That's because it will lead to the Noah's Ark which I cannot get out of.  I didn't know what this thing does but we will find out during the end of this game.
573,19,9,1c4,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p4n2/1p6/2p1P3/1BN1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So he responds by attacking my B.  Unfortunately there is no way for me to defend my piece.  I do however get lucky for a short while because he doesn't take it immediately but that luck is short lived.  Sooner or later he is going to win my LSB and there's nothing that I can do about it.
574,19,10,1Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p4n2/1p6/2p1P3/1BN1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',With nothing to lose I decide to develop my last piece so that development is complete.
575,19,11,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p4n2/1p1p4/2p1P3/1BN1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R4RK1 w - d6',At this point he is interested in forcing an exchange.  But there is more to this then meets the eye.  During this phase he will win my B for two pawns as I implied on my last move.
576,19,12,b4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p4n2/3P4/1p6/1PN1Q3/1PPB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',After the exchange he decides to attack my N.  But this move does more then that.  In order to prevent the exchange of a N for a P I have no choice but to let my d pawn go.  This means that I'm still losing something when I'm already behind so this gives a very strong edge.  And he takes by attacking my Q which means that like before there will be no compensation for what I'm about to lose.
577,19,13,Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/pq6/3n4/1p2N3/1P4Q1/1PPB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I do not know why he played this.
578,19,14,1Bh6,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/pq5B/3n4/1p2N3/1P4Q1/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',?? But that did not bother me when it should have.  I figured that he let his guard down and underestimated.  So I thought that he had allowed a mate in one.  In other words I thought that mate would be inevitable after 18.Qxg7# as it is illegal for black to take with his g pawn.  As it turns out however this move is actually unsound because I overlooked where black's Q was located.  Therefore Jim will punish this because he can and will take with his Q.  Therefore I inadvertently gave away a free piece with this choice.  With that in mind he has an official winning advantage.  But I am not ready to resign yet.  
579,19,15,1Rfd1,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p6q/3n4/1p2N3/1P4Q1/1PP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',After he takes I attempt to punish black by kicking his N.  But he has an easy way around it and despite being behind in development the game is almost over for white.  And I am almost ready to resign but I still have some fight in me.  I feel that resignation is a little premature in this position.
580,19,16,1Nf4,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p6q/8/1p2Nn2/1P4Q1/1PP2PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',!! At first I was wondering why he played this as opposed to something like 18...Nb6 or 18...Nc7.  As it turns out black has an extremely good reason for this move.  And it is extraordinarily brilliant because in a few moves he is going to threaten mate in such a way that will end the game for white as we are about to see.
581,19,17,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/4bppp/p6q/8/1p2Nn2/1P4Q1/1PP2PPP/R2R3K b - -',At this point I see that he is attempting to fork my Q and K with 19...Ne2.  Therefore determined not to allow that I respond with this.  Also feasible however was 19.Re1.  Unfortunately I did not think about that possibility before playing this move.  But I don't know if this choice or Re1 was better because they both accomplish the same thing.  And the only problem with either move is no matter what I do he is still going to my fork my K and Q shortly.
582,19,18,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/1b2bppp/p6q/8/1p2Nn2/1P4Q1/1PP2PPP/R2R3K w - -',So he attempts to win my e4 N by completing his development with a fianchetto.  Unfortunately for him I am not going to allow that.  However the game is officially lost white at this point.  But I am still determined to hang in there for as long as I can.
583,19,19,Bxg2+,b'r4rk1/4bppp/p6q/8/1p3n2/1P4Q1/1PPN1PbP/R2R3K w - -',And it starts with this move because he just won another pawn and my K is now exposed.  Therefore 21.Kg1 is forced. and that's a move that I did not want to play.  However it is about to get a lot worse.
584,19,20,Ne2+,b'r4rk1/4bppp/p6q/8/1p6/1P4Q1/1PPNnPbP/R2R2K1 w - -',"This is it!!  At this point what I was trying to prevent just became inevitable.  What was I trying to prevent?  Well he successfully played this fork.  So at this point I know that my Q is gone on top of what I already.  Therefore I resign this time because I am going to so far behind and there will no compensation.  BTW I put that in my resignation.  And my opponent said ""Now you learned about the Noah's Ark Trap."""

677,23,8,1b4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1np1/3Ppp2/1PP1P3/2N2P2/P2NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 b - b3',Continuing the plan. This prepares for c5.

684,23,15,1Rf7,b'r1bq2k1/ppp2rbp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/1PN1Pp2/2N2P2/P1Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 w - -',The purpose of this move might not be obvious at first. It protects the c7-square which will be important for White if he wishes to penetrate the position. In addition it frees the f8-square for other pieces and allows the rook to join the attack if it is needed on the g- of h-files.
685,23,16,1a4,b'r1bq2k1/ppp2rbp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/PPN1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - a3',This is unnecessary I think. I would exchange the pawns now with cxd6.

Defending the h3-pawn with 25. Kg2 leads to 25...Nh4+ 26. Kg1 Qxh3 27. Bd3 Ng5 and White is helpless; for example 28. Qe2 g2 29. Nde3  (29. Re1 Qh1+ 30. Kf2 Nh3# or 29. Kf2 Qg3+ 30. Kg1 Nh3#) Rg7 30. Nf5 gxf1Q+ 31. Qxf1 Ngxf3+ 32. Kf2 Qh2+ 33. Qg2 Qxg2#. I did not have to calculate all the variations before I sacrificed the bishop. My intuition told me this was winning already. This combination of moves Nh4 Ng5 Qxh3 and g2 is repeated in many variations and that is what I saw.

Other defences still leave Black with the advantage. For example 25. Ndb2 Nh4 26. Bd3 Ng5 and winning similarly for example 27. Qe2 Qxh3 28. Nxd6 g2 29. Nxf7 Kxf7 30. d6 Qg3 with a checkmate to follow with Nh3#.

Perhaps the best defence is giving back some material with 25. Nf2!? and then not 25...gxf2+ 26. Kxf2 Qxh3 27. Ke1 and White's king is safe and he will probably counterattack on the kingside with equal chances. Correct is to refuse the defensive sacrifice with 25...Ng5! (or 25...Nh4! the move order is not that critical) 26. Rfd1 Nh4 27. Rb3 (27. Rd3 gxf2+ 28. Kxf2 Qxh3 29. Ke1 Nhxf3+ 30. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 31. Rxf3 Qxf3 32. Rb3 Qh1+ 33. Kd2 f3 34. Ne3 Bh6 and eventually the passed pawn costs White material) Rg7 28. Bf1 (28. Ng4 Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 hxg4 30. fxg4 Rxg4 winning or 28. Nxd6 gxf2+ 29. Kxf2 Qxh3 30. Ke1 Nhxf3+ 31. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 32. Rxf3 Qxf3 with a winnign attack) Ngxf3+ 29. Rxf3 Nxf3+ 30. Kg2 Nh4+ 31.

But the threats are the same as given in the annotation after the previous move: Nh4 Qxh3 and then either checkmate or advancing the passed pawn. For example: 26. Nxd6 Bxd6 27. Bxd6 Nh4! 28. Qe2 (or 28. Rb2 Qxh3 29. Qe2 Rg7 30. Bxe5 g2! 31. Bxg7 Nhxf3+ 32. Qxf3 Nxf3+ 33. Kf2 Qg3+ 34. Ke2 gxf1Q+ winning) Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 g2+ 30. Qxg2+ Nxg2 31. Bxe5 Ng5 and Black wins.

I emphasize that I did not calculate all the variations during the game but trusted in my intuition and experience from similar positions."
704,24,0,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I am not familiar with this opening against the queen's gambit. It may have merit but it looks to me like it doesn't offer control over the center. 
705,24,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Notice how control is now focused on the 5 line instead of the 5/4 lines. This gives white a full 33% more space with which to maneuver
706,24,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',White solidifies control of the center. Pay attention to whites development options as compared to black. White can all backrow pieces except rooks and can support/defend pawns that are pushed
707,24,3,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/q7/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is most likely too early. If you bring your queen out while everyone has a lot of material on the board not only does it reduce its effectiveness because there are fewer spaces it can threaten but it gives the opponent a chance to threaten it. Would you make Qc7 on this turn? If no then don't move the queen leave her be. The queen is actually in a pretty good starting position so long as you get the pieces around her out of the way
708,24,4,Bd2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/q7/2PPP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I can develop my bishop while also putting pressure on the queen. The queen being out front is now a liability
709,24,5,c5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/1qp1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Again a liability. Qb2 leads to trading the queen for a rook (iirc) and so full retreat is the best move. This has given white three free moves (Bd2 to threaten c5 to threaten again and then the next move after. Note that it also locks out blacks black bishop from moving aggressively past the front
710,24,6,Qc7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppqp2pp/2p1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Don't be afraid of putting the piece back where it started if that is the best move. Not sure it is or not but something to think about.
711,24,7,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppqp2pp/2p1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',More development preparing to castle.

Notice how there are no pawns behind it supporting? Once f6 falls so does g5. So i attack the f6 pawn. This also has the advantage of locking out the queen from being able to pressure on its long diagonal.
713,24,9,h6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppqp4/2p1pp1p/2P1P1p1/3P4/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',At this point i feel like the game is irrevocably won for white. Black has none of his backline developed does not have a strong defense in the event of a king side castle and is many moves away from a queen side. I attack the weak pawn and move my knight forward to exploit this poor defense
714,24,10,d6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppq5/2pppn1p/2P1N1p1/3P4/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I am not sure what black can do at this point. The fork at Ng6 ensures that black cannot castle and trades a knight for a bishop in a game without strong diagonal pawn lines. Diagonal pawn lines constrain bishops in ways that don't constrain knights. So this trade is definitely in the favor of white. This move also makes e6 a weak pawn. Which will be exploited as soon as the knight is out of danger
715,24,11,1Bc4,b'rnb1kr2/ppq5/2pppn1p/2P3p1/2BP4/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQq -',e6 is weak. So white develops. This lets white get his king out of the center of the board when black cannot set up batteries and generally exploit the fact that three of blacks pieces are doing almost nothing.
716,24,12,Nbd7,b'r1b1kr2/1pqn4/2pppn1p/p1P3p1/2BP4/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w q -',While moving to the edge is generally not preferred because knights can control so many fewer spaces from there. This move gives white a pawn for free. Its possible that black could have retained control of e6. Though there are no good moves here.
717,24,13,Qxc8,b'r1q1kr2/1p6/2p2n1p/p1n3p1/8/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w q -',The trade looks even on points possibly advantageous for black since it has two knights to a knight and bishop. But now blacks king is open and white simply has to hammer the advantage in.
718,24,14,2Rae1,b'r1q1kr2/8/2p1nn1p/pp4p1/8/2N1B3/PP2QPPP/4RRK1 b q -',White sets up a battery on blacks king forcing him to move. He can move to a position where he doesn't have cover and be checked or to a position where he does have cover. Always be cognizant of fork opportunities though moving to the open position is better here.

But it looked like it would take quite a while for me to get my queen to that side of the board and my opponent seemed to be playing a solid game and would punish me for such reckless play.

As it is my development seems only marginally better.  These past few moves have gone rather slowly for both of us.

But I couldn't see a way of taking advantage of the hanging queen so after quite a bit of thought I decided on the following combination:
748,25,27,2Qe3,b'r6r/p1pq1pk1/1pn1b1pp/4p3/6PN/N1PpQ2P/PP3P1K/R5R1 b - -',Now I want to protect my pawn before he pins my queen to it with a rook.  e5-e6 would be nice so I tried to prepare that.
749,25,28,2Bd5,b'r6r/p1pq1pk1/1pn3pp/3bp3/6PN/N1PpQ2P/PP3P1K/R5R1 w - -',Blunder--hangs my d pawn.  I believe Qd5 was needed here instead.
750,25,29,2Rad1,b'r6r/p1pq1pk1/1pn3pp/3bp3/6PN/N1PpQ2P/PP3P1K/3R2R1 b - -',But he missed it so I was able to connect the pawns.

Ordinarily I don't care if my opponent resigns but I kind of with I could have played this out to mate as it seems really interesting. Oh well it's his choice.
1027,33,0,Ng5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6N1/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the famous and ancient Allgaier Gambit - considered by many to fall short of real 'soundness'.  White's Knight is trapped and must be given up.  Can White get enough for the material?  That is what the MT is designed to discover.  An alternative gambit line by the way is 5.Ne5 the Kieseritzky.  It is considered a deal less compromising than the Allgaier.
1028,33,1,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/7p/6N1/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Trapping the Knight.  There is no turning back for White now!

Instead the engine prefers 7.Qxg4 Qf6  8.Nc3 h5  9.Bc4ch Ke8  10.Qg5.  Can't say I go a bundle over this line at all for White.  My MCO10 by the way also suggests 7.d4 and 7.Bc4ch at this point.

Possibly he was hoping to induce 10.e5 or maybe simply wished to subject White's centre to greater pressure.  However I would have thought 9...Nxe4 or the GK engine's suggestion 9...d5 might have been more forceful.
1035,33,8,1Be2,b'rnb4r/ppppqk2/5n1p/8/1b1PPBpP/2N5/PPP1B1P1/R2QK2R b KQ -',[?] Jo comes within an ace of slipping into passivity - a little bit of a tendency she still has to overcome.  Nor would 10.Bd3 have been much chop.  The GK engine offers a fine continuation in 10.Bc4ch! Ke8  11.0-0 Bxc3  12.bxc3 d6  13.e5 dxe5  14.Bxe5 ... and White's game looks great to me!  Instead White wants to blunt Black's pawn wedge on the K-side but Black can maintain that useful salient.  White's gaze should be directed at and focused upon the Black King.

Although Black has to give up one of his few active pieces its scope was not huge and the White Knight was showing a tendency to improve its prospects at e4 d5 or even b5.

Possibly this is correct but Jo is beginning to play 'out of character' here and really wanting to take the fight to her opponent.

However it is not easy to see how White ought to proceed here.  No good seems 14.Rf4 Qe3ch  15.Kh1 Bxa1 -(or 15...Nc6!).  The engine suggests 14.Rf1 but maybe 14.Rf2 is an improvement depriving Black of a checking move.  After 14.Rf2 Bxa1  15.Bxh8 White's active game seems to compensate for the piece deficit.
1044,33,17,1Ba3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp4/5R1p/4B3/3Pq1pP/b7/P1P1B1P1/1R1Q2K1 w - -',[?] Returns the compliment.  But again it is not so easy in a roller coaster ride like this to discern how the game is like to go.  Instead 14...d6! would have placed White in real trouble: 14...d6!  15.Rxb2 dxe5  16.Rf1 ... (16.dxe5 Qxe5 attacks both rooks)  16...Qxd4ch  17.Qxd4 exd4 and White's attack has been blunted for good. 
1045,33,18,1Bd3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp4/5R1p/4B3/3Pq1pP/b2B4/P1P3P1/1R1Q2K1 b - -',[!?] This looks very good indeed but the simple 15.Rb3 was probably even better bringing the rook into action with a gain of tempo ready to slide over to the e-file say.  A possible continuation would have been 15.Rb3 Bc5(!)  16.Kh1 Be7  17.Rf4 Qh7  18.Bd3 with a huge attack.
1046,33,19,1Qe3+,b'rnb1k2r/pppp4/5R1p/4B3/3P2pP/b2Bq3/P1P3P1/1R1Q2K1 w - -',The Queen has very few squares available -  pitiable lamed creature that she is.

Up until now White has been fighting hard to make good on her gambited material but after this slip by Black she has a big edge.  Instead 16...d6  17.Bg6ch Kd8  18.Rb3 Qc1! would have forced the Queens off reducing thereby White's attacking resources.

Considering the complexities of this game it is surprising how often there is more than one good move available in a given position.  That sort of thing can actually make the attacker's task much harder.  It's none too comfortable for the defender neither!
1049,33,22,1Rf7,b'rnbk3r/ppppbR2/6Bp/4B3/3P2pP/4q3/P1P3P1/1R1Q3K b - -',Now was a good moment to mobilize her last reserve the b1-rook who is feeling a little left out of the fun right now.  After 18.Rb3! the Black Queen would have been trapped!  The game might then have continued 18.Rb3! Qxb3  19.axb3 d6! -(not 19...Bxf6??  20.Bxf6 with a 2-bishop mate!)- 20.Rxd6ch cxd6  21.Bxh8 ... Although material would then be roughly level (Q for R and N) White's superior mobility - Black Q-side as yet unmoved - would probably have been decisive.

Black in his hurry to undertake the long postponed mobilization of his right wing falls into the clutches of the text move Charybdis.  However the situation is already pretty dire as after 19...Nc6  20.Bf6 d5  21.Rb3 (or 21.Re1) looks horrible for Black e.g.: 21.Rb3 Qe6  22.Bxe7ch Nxe7  23.Rf8ch Rxf8 - White's close assault is incurring heavy casualties but it's in a good cause - 24.Qxf8ch Kd7  25.Be8ch Kd6  26.Qf4ch Qe5  27.Qxe5#.

However with two pieces 'en prise' White could have thrown in a third with decisive results:  20.Rxe7!! and now [a] 20...Kxe7  21.Qf7ch! Kd8  22.Bf6ch and mate next.  That is easy to see  but what if... [b] 20...Bd7 then?  Answer: 21.Bf6! ... -(a battery unmasked whilst setting up another!) 21... Qxe7  -(there is no way to save the king and Queen both!)  22.Bxe7ch Kxe7  23.Qf7ch etc.

Yet a more tactically minded player of the White pieces would certainly have seen at once the possibility of and given serious consideration to 22.Rxe7.  I did say it was something of  central motif of the game hereabouts didn't I?  After 22.Rxe7!! we have [a] 22...Kxe7  23.Qxe5ch Be6  24.Bf5 ... winning a piece at least; [b] 22...Rxg6  23.Qxe5 Bd7  24.Rh7.

White is still trying to extract the full point out of this game but it is getting to be high time to shelve such ambitions and look to saving the draw.  It seems possible to achieve that much at this point after 27.Qf6 Rg8  28.Bh7 Re8  29.Bg6 Rg8 and a repetition.  Maybe Jo had this in mind with this move but...

So the GK engine notwithstanding the final position objectively speaking and with best play should lead to a draw anyhow.  Note my wording here.  It would be wrong to call the position 'drawn' and I consider the GK engine's evaluation probably about right in the circumstances.  It would have been so easy for White in particular to have fallen into a losing line - she would have had to walk a narrow path to safety.  What a game:  high quality hard fought and combative.

1189,38,24,1Nf3,b'r4rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2bpnb1/3p4/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',...Maybe. Perhaps Qc7 or e5 had White's attention both on their own are strong moves but not if they were played together and the knight always had a flight square either way. Also if e5 I block the bishop attack on h2 and d5 is exposed to White's Queen so I couldn't see the concern here.
1190,38,25,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2bpnb1/3p4/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I notice how weak White's defenses were along this file so out comes Hermione.

1192,38,27,1Bxc2,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/1P6/P3PN2/2b1NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',So I accept my pawn and hit the Queen.

1198,38,33,1e5,b'2r2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2b1n2/3pp3/1P2bN2/P3PN2/R2Q1PPP/2B1R1K1 w - -',I know I could have exchanged here and maybe I should have given what happens later. But I figured that f4 was a fine square for this knight so I try pushing it to a different square.
1199,38,34,1Nh3,b'2r2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2b1n2/3pp3/1P2b3/P3PN1N/R2Q1PPP/2B1R1K1 b - -',As I had hoped.

1205,38,40,2Bb2,b'2r2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2b4/3p4/1P2pPn1/P3P2N/RB1Q1P1P/4R1K1 b - -',? - White didn't see Qxd5 thankfully however it is clear that some tempo was restored here.
1206,38,41,2Qd7,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2b4/3p4/1P2pPn1/P3P2N/RB1Q1P1P/4R1K1 w - -',So I move the queen to pressure the knight having realized the attack on h2 was impossible at this point and that if I left her there then surely Rc1 by White could be devastating...
1207,38,42,2Qd4,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2b4/3p4/1P1QpPn1/P3P2N/RB3P1P/4R1K1 b - -',!? - Threatening Qxg7# instead of just Qxd5 again however...

1212,38,47,2dxe4,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1pp1/p2b1n1p/8/1P1QpP2/P3P3/RB3P1P/4R1K1 w - -',But of course I'm not falling for that! Now White must find a best move facing a clear threat- Qg4.
1213,38,48,2Kf1,b'2r2rk1/1p1q1pp1/p2b1n1p/8/1P1QpP2/P3P3/RB3P1P/4RK2 b - -',I think Kh1 was better. If Kh1 and I play Qh3 I can't play Ng4 (threatening Qxh2#) at that point because as soon as I move my knight White wins immediately on Qxg7. I could then try Be7 followed by Rfd8 to drive the Queen away but it requires me to slow down my attack and give White more of a chance to return.
1214,38,49,2Qh3+,b'2r2rk1/1p3pp1/p2b1n1p/8/1P1QpP2/P3P2q/RB3P1P/4RK2 w - -',But since I want to play Qh3 anyway this check just further gives me more tempo over White.

I decided that an exchange would be a very foolish move on my part.
1221,38,56,2Ke2,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/p2b1n1p/8/1P2pP2/P3P2q/RB2KP1P/3QR3 b - -',White was probably hoping I'd continue trying to perp check to force a draw.

Thanks to Harry Potter White can't consider trading the queen for the rook and bishop (Qxd8+ Rxd8! - exf4?? Qd3#). The Boy Who Lived must be ignored and White loses all control of the kingside at this point.
1223,38,58,3Bd4,b'2rr2k1/1p3pp1/p4n1p/8/1P1Bpb2/P3P2q/R3KP1P/3QR3 b - -',Really the only conservative move White has but the position is lost.

After Ron sits out most of the match he moves to d5 and it's clear that after Nc3 the knight attacks everything precious White has left standing. This is why all the kids back at school call him Wizard Chess Grandmaster! (What a showoff.)
1231,38,66,3Ke1,b'2r3k1/1p3pp1/p6p/3n4/1P1Pp3/P7/R4Pqb/1Q2KR2 b - -',White cannot afford more lost tempo to king checks.
