Going in I had no plan except to use the opening DB observe the position of the board carefully and try not to screw up too much. Altogether I think I played a decent game I just found I had a tendency to overthink every move when the obvious move was the best. Several times I overlooked an advantageous position by telling myself ""But Pete is really really good so there's got to be a better move."" and then making a wrong move. Anyhow I will annotate using my in-game notes and comments to illustrate my thinking with occasional deviation to explore a mistake."
49,1,1,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -', And now I'm facing a pickle. The proscribed move here is e3 but Qc2 is a close second and probably because of the likelihood of Bxc3 followed by bxc3 and stacking pawns on the c file. e3 seems like the better move to me simply because I know bishops tend to be stronger later in the game and the board doesn't seem to be all that closed. It seems unlikely you'd want to trade your B for an N at this stage unless I decide to move to a3 but still the same problem with the stacked pawns. Seems silly to use a move only to force stacking my own pawns. I tend to think you'll opt for further development and so I probably should as well.
50,1,2,f3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -'," I chose f3 here because of both your fianchetto and your N at f6. Ostensibly I can sort bay of your options for a moment with this move and still leave room for my B at d3 and the N at e2. I would expect either O-O or Bb7 next from you.

Coaching note: i see your reasoning but Nf3 was still the better move. with f3 you disrupt the probable K defence when later you 0-0"

I still sort of expect you'd want to trade your DS bishop for the knight or perhaps just maintain the pin. The pin forces me to deal with your B at every consideration but you've also closed it in with your pawn at c5. The pawn closing it in makes it a more attractive swap as it becomes sort of lame at b5 just for maintenance plus b4 is a crap trade for you. I think you're just waiting for me to a3 before making the trade. Now... having said all of that I expect Nc6 is your next move.

I considered Bg5 here but I thought you'd likely just h6 and force me to trade to put your Q at f6 which doesn't seem attractive for me. I would expect you'll castle as well and start moving to exploit the pawn at f3.

Coaching note: a good alternative here would have been Ba3 to prevent my 0-0 for a while

 You know I did look at that but discarded the idea since the block with d6 was so easy and then I lost the right diagonal from its current position. d6 didn't look like it would inconvenience you at all."

Coaching note: If you were going to play a R move then better was Rad1. It was doing not a lot on a1.
The R on f1 was protecting the K and should have remained on that side. The reason i initiated exchanges goes right back to your f3. you have ended up with a bad pawn structure relative to mine so if i trade down to a K and pawn ending then i must have an advantage."
61,1,13,1Rxd6,b'r4rk1/p4ppp/1pqR1n2/8/8/B1P2P2/P3Q1PP/R5K1 b - -',I'm making this move with the idea you'll move to protect your Q and depending on which way you jump I want to line up my rooks and/or team up my Q with one or both of my Rs with the added benefit of the discovered threat on your R at f8 if I need to vacate d6. If you were closer to my level I'd expect Qxc3 but from your annotations and forum posts I've read it seems unlikely you'd bring your Q out with so little cover. However Qxc3 followed by Rfc8 looks pretty solid as cover. Even still I feel like this is my best option.

 Hmmm... I feel like I'm missing something but the only consequence of this move I can see is a fork at Nc3+.
 Or another at Nf4+ but I feel like both are relatively well defended."

Coaching note: playing a4 1st would have made sure of swapping the pawn off

My response because I honestly wasn't seeing it at the time: Hmmm... Doesn't that lead from f4+to Ke4 Rxd6 Kxf4 and then the rest of my pawns? I looked at that as well and didn't see a good way to stop your K and fgh with just my R. Every way I looked you got all on mine and kept one of yours.

Coaching note: no if i go for f4 pawn then trade my N for it i am dead. My N is the only piece i can harry you with so i must keep it. to f4+ i would play Kd5 protecting the N and attacking your R."

78,2,7,dxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black now takes the offered pawn.
79,2,8,Nxc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White recaptures and attacks the pawn on d5.
80,2,9,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3p4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So black advances and counter-attacks the knight.
81,2,10,Nb5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/1N2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',And now the pawn on d4 is attacked twice by queen and knight but only protected once.
82,2,11,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/1N2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black gives the pawn back as a rather nasty check is in the air.
83,2,12,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/4P3/3N4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White takes the pawn back.
84,2,13,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p7/4P3/1b1N4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But this check comes in. If white blocks with the bishop the knight on d4 falls so white is forced to play a very unnatural move.

96,2,25,1Qxe3+,b'r3k1nr/1ppn1ppp/p7/8/1b6/4qN1P/PP2KPP1/R1B2B1R w kq -',So the queens come off.
97,2,26,1Bxe3,b'r3k1nr/1ppn1ppp/p7/8/1b6/4BN1P/PP2KPP1/R4B1R b kq -',and white gets a piece into play. With these exchanges white makes it less likely that his king will be mated in the centre.
98,2,27,1Ngf6,b'r3k2r/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/8/1b6/4BN1P/PP2KPP1/R4B1R w kq -',Black develops the other knight.

107,2,36,1Ke3,b'r3k2r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N3/3n4/P3K2P/1P3PP1/2R2B1R b kq -',This also attack the knight.
108,2,37,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N3/3n4/P3K2P/1P3PP1/2R2B1R w - -',This move protects the pawn on c7 with the king and the knight on d4 with the rook but leaves the pawn on f7 hanging. Presumably if white takes black will save the exchange with Rh8-e8+. but it still seems like giving back a pawn...
109,2,38,2Bc4,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/4N3/2Bn4/P3K2P/1P3PP1/2R4R b - -',White finally develops the bishop.

357,11,2,1e6,b'r1bq1rk1/3nppbp/2p1P1p1/pp4B1/6n1/PBN2N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This was a really good move.  Black is in significant trouble here only a dozen moves into the game.
358,11,3,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/4pnb1/2p3pp/pp6/6nB/PBN2N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',h6 prevents Ng5.  The pinned Nf7 is really a problem for Black.
359,11,4,1Bg3,b'r1bq1rk1/4pnb1/2p3pp/pp6/6n1/PBN2NB1/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I thought this move was unnecessary.  Apparently Black fears g5 but if that move is played there is time for Bg3 later.  For now I would have piled on to the lonely e7 pawn.
360,11,5,Ra7,b'2b2r2/r3pnbk/2p3pp/pp6/6n1/PBN2NB1/1PP2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',This is awkward for Black.  Black is barely keeping the position together--and probably can't continue to do so if White presses.
361,11,6,1Ne5,b'2b2r2/r3pnbk/2p2npp/pp2N3/8/PBN3BP/1PP2PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',This move allows me to exchange pieces.  
362,11,7,Bc8,b'2b2r2/r3p1bk/2p2npp/pp2B3/6P1/PBN4P/1PP2P2/3RR1K1 w - -',The light-square Bishop doesn't have a lot of squares!
363,11,8,2Ne4,b'2b2r2/r3p1bk/2p2npp/pp2B3/4N1P1/PB5P/1PP2P2/3RR1K1 b - -',This allows more exchanges which simplifies my defensive task.
364,11,9,Kf6,b'2b2r2/2r1p3/5kpp/ppp5/4R1P1/PBP4P/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',Again Black can barely hold it together.
365,11,10,c4,b'2b2r2/2r1p3/5kpp/pp6/2p1R1PP/PBP5/1P3P2/4R1K1 w - -',Finally I was able to reduce the scope of the Bishop.
366,11,11,3Re4e6+,b'2b5/2r1pr2/4Rkp1/pp4p1/2p4P/P1P5/1PB2P2/4R1K1 b - -',I think this was a simple blunder on the part of my opponent.  White loses the exchange.
367,11,12,Rxb2,b'R7/4p3/4r1pk/8/2p5/P1P5/1r4B1/6K1 w - -',White still has a shot here because of the passed a pawn.  
368,11,13,Rg5,b'R7/4p3/6pk/P5r1/2p5/2P5/1r4B1/6K1 w - -',White may have missed this tactic.  There's only one way to save the Bishop and it will leave to the loss of the passed pawn.
369,11,14,Kg7,b'7R/4p1k1/6p1/P5r1/2p5/2P5/1r4B1/6K1 w - -',Now both the Bishop and the Rook are under attack so the only logical way to avoid dropping a piece is to protect one with the other.
370,11,15,Rxa5,b'8/4p1k1/6p1/r7/2p5/2P5/1r4BR/6K1 w - -',And that leads to the a pawn's disappearance.  Now Black should have a relatively easy endgame task with two passed pawns after the pieces are traded off.
371,11,16,Kf6,b'8/4p3/5kp1/6r1/2p5/2P5/1r4BR/6K1 w - -',By attacking the B twice White's R is forced to h2.  That allows my King an important tempo to get nearer to the center.
372,11,17,4Kxg2,b'8/4p3/5kp1/8/2p5/2P5/6K1/8 b - -',Now that the pieces are exchanged Black moves to control the center and to make sure that White can't use the c pawn.
373,11,18,g5,b'8/4p3/8/4k1p1/2p5/2P2K2/8/8 w - -',Here comes the g pawn.  If White moves to stop it his c pawn will fall.  
374,11,19,g3,b'8/4p3/8/8/2p1k3/2P3p1/4K3/8 w - -',Now Black will have to make a choice.  Either the c or g pawn will promote.
375,11,20,Kd2,b'8/4p3/8/8/2p5/6K1/3k4/8 w - -',With Kd2 Black controls the promotion square for the c pawn.  It will sail in for the win.
376,11,21,Qc6,b'8/4K3/2q5/8/8/8/3k4/8 w - -',White resigned here realizing Black has a simple K+Q checkmate.  I think this game was probably winnable for White with more aggressive play in the opening.  Because Black had so few options White could have taken time to improve until Black cracked.  Trading off attackers made Black's job easier.
377,12,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Natanya and I enjoy playing each other.  She is up on me with our games by 7 to 3.  I have never kept my 2 pawns in the centre and marched them up to mate the king.  It is not as easy as it seems but I just seemed to get my pieces in the right places and came out the winner.  This time!
378,12,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I started the game with queens pawn to d4 and black went with pawn to d5
379,12,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I now move pawn to c4 while black took this with his d5 pawn.  I often play Nf6 to protect my d4 pawn but if black takes c4 I will halt him with my next move Nc3.
380,12,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',So my next move was Nc3 and black played e5.
381,12,4,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3Pp3/2p5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I now push my d4 pawn up to d5 and black plays c6.
382,12,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/2p1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I now back up my d5 pawn with e4 and black plays Nf6.  I will be looking to protect my d5 pawn further.
383,12,6,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/2pPp3/2B1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',I capture black's c4 pawn with my LB and black pushes his c pawn to c5.
384,12,7,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3b1n2/2pPp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I develop my knight to f3 and black brings out his DB to d6.
385,12,8,h6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/3b1n1p/2pPp1B1/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I develop my DB out to g5 with the protection of knight at f3 and attacking the f6 knight.  Black pushes his h pawn to h6 attacking my DB.
386,12,9,g5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3p2/3b1n1p/2pPp1p1/2B1P2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq g6',I move my DB to h4 and black pushes his g pawn to g5 chasing my DB.  This has left his king with not a lot of protection.
387,12,10,g4,b'rnbqk2r/pp3p2/3b1n1p/2pPp3/2B1P1p1/2N2NB1/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I continue to retreat my DB down to g3 and black's g pawn continues to attack white with move to g4 and attacking knight at f3.
388,12,11,h5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3p2/3b1n2/2pPN2p/2B1P1p1/2N3B1/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I move my f3 knight to e5 into the path of black's DB but should black take the knight my DB is on the same diagonal at g3 and will retake.  Black continues to push his king side pawn on the h file to h5. 
389,12,12,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1p2/3b1n2/2pPN2p/Q1B1P1p1/2N3B1/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I now move my queen out to check king at a4 and black moves his LB to block the check.
390,12,13,Qxd7,b'rn2k2r/pp1q1p2/3b1n2/2pP3p/Q1B1P1p1/2N3B1/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',My e5 knight takes black's LB at d7. Black retakes with queen.  I have the protection of my knight at c3 so may not move my queen.
391,12,14,Qxa4,b'rn2k2r/pp3p2/3B1n2/2pP3p/q1B1P1p1/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I now take the 2nd bishop at d6 with my DB as I aim to push my pawns which have control of the centre. Black queen takes my queen at a4.
392,12,15,b6,b'rn2k2r/p4p2/1p1B1n2/2pP3p/N1B1P1p1/8/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I now retake black's queen with my c4 knight and black brings out his b pawn to b6.  I need to get my knight back to c3 to protect my e4 pawn as black's knight could take as currently at f6 and I have nothing to defend this capture.
393,12,16,Kd8,b'rn1k3r/p4p2/1p1B1n2/1BpP3p/N3P1p1/8/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',To give me a chance to move my knight back I check the king and I can then move my knight back to protect my e4 pawn.  Black's king moves out of check to d8.
394,12,17,a6,b'rn1k3r/5p2/pp1B1n2/1BpP3p/4P1p1/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I now move my knight back to c3 and protect my e4 pawn.  Black moves out his 'a' pawn attacking my bishop at b5.  This is also being protected by my good 'c' knight.
395,12,18,Ne8,b'rn1kn2r/5p2/pp1B4/2pP3p/4P1p1/2NB4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',My LB moves to d3 and is also protecting the e4 pawn and black's knight goes to e8.  I think he must see that I am coming up and is getting ready to defend.
396,12,19,Rh6,b'rn1kn3/5p2/pp5r/2pPB2p/4P1p1/2NB4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I move my DB to e5 to provide protection to my d5 pawn as I prepare to move it to d6. Black moves his h rook to h6 ready to take my pawn should I be stupid enough to put it on the 6th row.  Or this may be protecting his pawn as he prepares to bring his pawn down to f6 and my DB is covering this square.
397,12,20,f6,b'rn1kn3/8/pp3p1r/2pPB2p/4P1p1/2NB4/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',I now castle to bring the rooks together to support my centre pawn push.  Black moves his pawn to f6.  This pawn is protected by the knight at e8 and h6 rook.
398,12,21,Rg6,b'rn1kn3/8/pp3pr1/2pP3p/4PBp1/2NB4/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',I retreat my DB to f4 and black moves his rook over from h6 to g6 as my DB is now attacking h6.
399,12,22,Rg7,b'rn1kn3/6r1/pp3p2/2pPP2p/5Bp1/2NB4/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',I now get to move my pawn to e5 and I think white is better here with pair of bishops and 2 extra pieces and a pawn.  I am looking to push my centre pawns and mate the king.  I will bring my h rook across to the centre e file to protect my other pawn.  Black moves his rook back to 7th row and may be looking to protect his king now as may expect his pawn could be taken but I will keep my pawn on the centre row to give me some security if one queening is captured then I have another one.
400,12,23,b5,b'rn1kn3/6r1/p3Pp2/1ppP3p/5Bp1/2NB4/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - -',I push my e pawn to e6 and black pushes a pawn to b5.  I would have thought that he may have put his rook by his king and block my pawn progress but I see that as my other pawn came up to d6 this would attack the rook at e7.  Another move might might have been move the knight to d6 and block d5 pawn but my DB at f4 was a threat to this move.
401,12,24,b4,b'rn1kn3/6r1/p3Pp2/2pP3p/1p3Bp1/2NB4/PP3PPP/2KRR3 w - -',Now I bring across my h rook to e1 to protect pawn on the e file.  Black pushes his b pawn and attacks my knight at c3.  I do have an extra piece and I must try to keep this advantage.
402,12,25,h4,b'rn1kn3/6r1/p3Pp2/2pP4/1p3Bpp/3B4/PP2NPPP/2KRR3 w - -',I feel I don't have to rush and I do protect my knight and retreat him to d2 and black pushes another pawn on the h file.
403,12,26,c4,b'rn1kn3/6r1/p3Pp2/3P1B2/1pp2Bpp/8/PP2NPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Now I move my LB to protect my passed pawn at e6 and black pushes his c pawn.
404,12,27,Nc6,b'r2kn3/6r1/p1nPPp2/5B2/1pp2Bpp/8/PP2NPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Now I push my d5 pawn to d6 and black moves his knight to e6 which will cover the e7 square where my pawn will check the king.
405,12,28,Nc7,b'r2k4/2nP2r1/p1n1Pp2/5B2/1pp2Bpp/8/PP2NPPP/2KRR3 w - -',I push my d6 pawn to d7 and black's knight moves out from e8 where he was being attacked by d7 pawn. This knight is now attacking my pawn at e6.  There was a rook also on the 7th row but as said before he could not capture as he would be recaptured by the e6 pawn.
406,12,29,Rg8,b'r2k2r1/2nP4/p1n1Pp1B/5B2/1pp3pp/8/PP2NPPP/2KRR3 w - -',I now attack the rook at g7 with my DB and black moves his rook up to g8.
407,12,30,Rb8,b'1r1k2r1/2nP4/p1n1Pp1B/5B2/1pp2Npp/8/PP3PPP/2KRR3 w - -',I bring up my e2 knight to f4 another protector for my e6 pawn as I thought the c7 knight may try to capture it and black moves his 'a' rook across to b8.  The rook move may be an attempt to attack my king down the b file where there are pawns ready to assist.  I think I need to get on with the job now.
408,12,31,Nxd5,b'1r1k2r1/3P4/p1n1Pp1B/3n1B2/1pp3pp/8/PP3PPP/2KRR3 w - -',I don't like the knights sitting on the side of the king on the c file especially as the c7 knight is protecting the queening square for my e6 pawn.  So I move my knight over to d5 and black captures this knight.
409,12,32,Ne5,b'1r1k2r1/3P4/p3Pp1B/3RnB2/1pp3pp/8/PP3PPP/2K1R3 w - -',I now capture the d5 knight with my d1 rook and black moves his other knight to e5 now attacking my d7 pawn.
410,12,33,Nd3+,b'1r1k2r1/3P4/p3Pp1B/3R1B2/1pp2Ppp/3n4/PP4PP/2K1R3 w - -',I push my pawn to f4 and attack the e5 knight which now moves to check my king at d3.  However this square is protected by my LB at f5.
411,12,34,cxd3,b'1r1k2r1/3P4/p3Pp1B/3R4/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K1R3 w - -',I capture the knight on d3 with my LB and black recaptures with e4 pawn.
412,12,35,Kc7,b'1r4r1/2kPP3/p4p1B/3R4/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K1R3 w - -',I don't waste time now capturing the d3 pawn and I check the black king but there are 2 rooks on the 8th row which can capture my queening pawn.  Black king moves out to c7 to get out of the check.
413,12,36,Rg6,b'1r6/2kPP3/p3RprB/3R4/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K5 w - -',Now I bring my e rook up in order to attack black's pawn at f6 and black moves out his g rook to g6 to protect the pawn and also threatening to take my DB at h6.  At the moment I am 4 points up so maybe black is looking to equalise a little by capturing a piece.
414,12,37,Rxd8,b'3r4/2k1P3/p3RprB/3R4/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K5 w - -',Now there is only 1 rook so I push my pawn and queen but this is captured as expected by the b rook.
415,12,38,Kb7,b'3Q4/1k6/p3RprB/3R4/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K5 w - -', Once the rook captures then I queen my e7 pawn by capturing the rook at d8 which checks the king at c7.   The king moves out of check to b7 as that is the only move available.
416,12,39,3Rd7#,b'3Q4/1k1R4/p3RprB/8/1p3Ppp/3p4/PP4PP/2K5 b - -',I now bring up the d5 rook to d7 and its checkmate.
417,13,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Blackburne Gambit.  Black gives up a pawn to try to get faster development. 
418,13,1,d3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This might be unnecessary as it blocks in the light-square Bishop.
419,13,2,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Black has slightly better Bishops and a tiny lead in development but is still down a pawn.
420,13,3,1Nh4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/5b2/7N/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Very anti-positional to put the Knight on the edge of the board.
421,13,4,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/1p2bppb/p1n1pn1p/8/7N/P1NP4/1PPBBPPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Black tries to use the semi-open file.

429,13,12,Qxh3,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1n5/3p3p/8/P1P3Bq/1P1Q4/R5K1 w - -',Yet another pawn--and now the King is completely exposed.  I think White just may have missed this hanging pawn.
430,13,13,2Kxg2,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1n5/3p3p/8/P1P3B1/1P4K1/R7 b - -',Black is happy to trade Queens with a three-pawn edge.  All three of Black's Kingside pawns are unopposed.
431,13,14,Rxd4,b'6k1/1p3pp1/p1n5/7p/3r4/P5B1/1P4K1/R7 w - -',Black trades off the isolated pawn just to make the endgame win simpler.
432,13,15,Rc4,b'8/1p3k2/pB3p2/4n1pp/1Pr5/P7/5K2/3R4 w - -',The e4 N is covering the d7 square so that Black's R can't create problems.
433,13,16,Nd3+,b'8/1p3k2/p4p2/2B3pp/PP6/2rn4/5K2/3R4 w - -',This forces a trade of the Bishop and Knight again simplifying the endgame win.
434,13,17,Rxc5,b'8/1p3k2/p4p2/2r3pp/P7/8/4K3/3R4 w - -',But now White's R can penetrate.  It won't matter because of the material deficit.
435,13,18,Rc5,b'8/1R6/p4pk1/P1r3pp/8/8/4K3/8 w - -',White cannot protect a5 and so will lose another pawn.
436,13,19,4Kf2,b'8/8/pR3pk1/r7/6pp/8/5K2/8 b - -',White's King cannot do much to stop the pawns.
437,13,20,5Kg1,b'8/8/p1R2p2/6k1/6pp/8/r7/6K1 b - -',Once the Rook starts to help the White King is confined to the edge of the board.
438,13,21,5Rd5,b'8/8/p7/3R1pk1/8/6pp/r7/5K2 b - -',Now Black can force a pawn through to promotion.
439,13,22,g1=Q+,b'8/8/p7/3R1pk1/8/7p/7K/r5q1 w - -',White's move is forced.
440,13,23,Ra3+,b'8/8/p7/3R1pk1/8/r6K/8/6q1 w - -',Qh1+ is a way to win the Rook but this checkmate is forced and faster too.
441,13,24,Rxd3#,b'8/8/p7/5pk1/8/3r3K/8/6q1 w - -',Finis.  White's problems started with Na4.  Before that the position was quite solid.  With a pawn advantage the goal should be just to play solid and try to get to a favorable endgame.  Perhaps White just tried to do too much.
442,14,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',[1 hr 12 min left] I arrived 3 min late. This is my favourite Alekhine's defense

Qd7 12. Neg5 Nd4 13. Nxd4 cxd4 =. The move I made is not bad either as it creates a thorn in the centre which cannot be easily removed (d4). I spent 10 minutes (from 1 hr 2 min to 52 min left) considering the disadvantages of weak pawn on d4 but found it well placed there. And if d4 pawn cannot be destroyed then it creates nice space advantage for black.

In my opinion White should concentrate their forces for an attack of the kingside. Thus 13. f4 or 13. Qh5 can be considered. Without confrontation black can concentrate his effort on getting hold of c and d files. Alternatively 13. c3 had to be played as d4 pawn hinders white's development.

The reason why I'm inclined to play 1.d4 is because I'd be inclined to follow up with the Colle's Franketort System as recommended by GM Susan Polgar. But as I saw in the Chicoboy's Legacy Forum black can prevent that. However I'm most used to 1.e4 openings. So I think that sticking to what I know is probably the best idea.  Ken: I mean't NOT too often. Ken: Either is fine sticking with what you know best is always good but trying new things is more educational. I have opened mostly 1.b3 but have also played 1.c4 1.d4 1.f4 1.g3 1.b4 1.Nf3 and even 1.e4 but not too often.  Joe: That answers my question. I want the more educational approach.
495,16,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Ken: Any preference on my defense. My usual are King's Indian Queen's IndiaN & the Dutch Defense?  Joe: I think that the King's Indian is a good approach because archduke_piccolo suggested that I get practice after annotating my loss against reversion with the King's Gambit.  Ken: Okay King's Indian it is. I like to slide into it by transposition. It gives my opponents more to think about and to worry about.  Joe: That makes sense. I like thinking about many things. Overtime I've learned that it's a good way to improve.  I had a little bit of a difficult time deciding between 2.Nf3 and 2.e3 This would go into the Colle System. With 2.e3 it transposes as the mainline starts with 2.Nf3 My preference is to get my Ng1 into play for development. However this will have to wait until tomorrow (when I come back from work) because I must log off for the rest of the night.  Ken: If we're heading to a normal KID Nf3 is the move the only other choices you should consider as white in this position are Nc3 c4 or e4. e3 is far too passive at this stage  Joe: I agree here. e3 should hold off and possibly be prevented which if so. Then the Colle System would not work because the actual sequence involves e3 being played. As far what move next after discussion it'll take some more though now that there are other moves to consider. I could do a normal KID if it's your recommendation but I also like the looks of Nc3 and e4 which not only allow me to develop but help to control the center. It's hard to know if I should do it normal or if it's better to transition into something else. Both are very educational since I haven't explored through any variation of the KID yet.  Ken: take your time to decide any of the moves I mrntioned will work albeit slightly differently.

Ken: an excellent move now after my move you need to think about pawn structure namely what type of center you want.
497,16,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Joe: A new lesson. I always until today thought it was just about center control. Now I know that there are different centers and it's hard to decide. If it's no longer too passive I was thinking of 3.e3 as now it is the Colle's System. But if that's too passive then I need a lot more time to think. This is where I really start comparing chess to a spin class and it's like being in a difficult level of gear.  Ken: If you play e3 right now you tell me that I don't have to fight the three pawn attack and you block your DSB from coming to f4 or g5. Now maybe that's OK maybe you never intend either of these but these Indian games are all about flexibility and keeping options open. If I was white I'd be thinking about playing g3 and fianchettoing the B on g2. This is a Viktor Korchnoi favorite or my choice might be to delay decioding by playing c4 and adding to my central control. As black my next move will be d6 aiming at a future e5 or c5 depending on what you do. Yes there are different centers depending on the pawn structure so take your time thinking. If I can find the reference book I'll send you diagrams for each structure or model games showing how to play each structure.  Joe:  I agree and I need my Bc1. So what comes to mind is what you mentioned about the fianchetto with b3. I'm also considering Nbd2 That's because in my recent game against Jack Stockel (which I annotated yesterday) I played the Colle's System. And after Queens Pawn Opening c4 followed by Nc3 were played. But they said that better then advancing the c pawn is bringing the Nb1-d2 Of course as you and a mentor mentioned it all depends on the position. I'm not convinced that it's such a good idea in the Nimzo Indian because I don't want to have a cramped position. Come to think of it as you mentioned playing Nbd2 at all would also block in my DSB. I also like the looks of just bringing my Bc1 to f5. But I like the Viktor Korchnoi because my bishop would have a longer diagnol and I also enjoy the longest diagnol. It also doesn't work out in every position. But when they do I like it so I'm leaning towards 3.b3  Ken: b3 is playable challenging me on the diagonal. Give some thought about what your response would be if after you play b3 I immediarely p[lay c5. If you like the resulting position then play b3 if you don't like it think some more
498,16,4,b3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3P4/1P3N2/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Joe:  I don't mind. I looked at other moves most would've been the same thing. There's one that didn't being 3.Nc3 which I think also would've resulted in 3...c5 followed by the loss of a Knight and Rook if I took. That would leave me in a very uncomfortable and stressful situation. Then I'd be thinking the same way that Magnus thought which becomes impulsive. And that's not a good way to go. Before playing this I looked at variations and I like the way this is going. And with your next move there's a lot that's going through my thought process as I think about the overall plan and how to fit that situation as per advice by bhidragon.

Now here comes the thought process as what went through my mind at first was so bad that you would've so said no. But I quickly ruled it out as an option on the last move while planning. So what came to mind at first was 4.dxc5?? because it appeared to win a pawn. But then I saw that the goal is to deflect that away due to my Ra1 being en-prise. I looked briefly at 4.Nc3 which loses a piece after you capture on c5. The other I looked at was 4.Na3 but in general I don't like placing the Knight on the rim. Plus you still win a pawn after 4...cxd4 But as per your advice I analyzed all of this before I played 3.b3. So the next move that comes to mind which I really like is what I mentioned earlier of 4.Bb2 for a nice long diagonol. Plus I have an extra defender so that I don't lose material since your Bg7 is a threat. This is a good way to take care of it. I also like the looks of 4.c3 but not as well because it doesn't develop. So I'm thinking of 4.Bb2.  Ken: sounds like you have thought it out fairly well
500,16,6,cxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3p4/1P3N2/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Joe: Ok we've reached a tough think about. But this is how far I planned just before playing b3. I must take to avoid losing a pawn. I'm thinking of how. I was at first interested in Bishop for N. So taking with 5.Nxd4 But I studied more about open and closed positions. And tactical-abyss gave me insights in general about 1.d4 So it applies here that it's better to exchange Bishop for N. That's because it's a closed position because of how the opening started. He said that in 1.d4 a Knight is generally worth more then a Bishop. So I think that 5.Bxd4 is the way to go.  Ken:  It's an okay way to go because I have no intention nor should I of playing Bxd4
501,16,7,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/3B4/1P3N2/P1P1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Joe: Only now am I starting to think about what to do. This is going to be difficult for me to decide. I know I'm not losing anything. What makes it difficult is that I'm on the fringe between playing 6.Nbd2 or 6.e3 Although it shouldn't have 6.e4 came into consideration except that I'm losing a pawn if that happens. I also think that 6.e3 is worse now then before. Not only is it passive but having my Bd4 blocked would be worse. I was also thinking about fianchettoing my other Bishop with 6.Bg2 but that seems a little too slow. The idea would be to develop and castle at once. But I think that developing sooner would be something that I'd want to do. And for that I feel that 6.Nbd2 would be the way to go.  Ken: 6.e3 is a good choice. This position is the whole point of this type of defense. There are at least 6 plausible moves here. Is one very much better than the others? My advice here is think some more and think about where you want your pawns to be. Examples: are you going to push the q-side pawns or the k-side? or none? Are you aiming at a piece led attack? Does exchanging benefit you at this point? Castling k-side q-side or not at all? How do you stand on the board? equality??  Joe: Yes I'll take all the time I need even if it's the last minute (which would mean being down to the last few hours.) Afterall despite getting better I still need some work on channeling the impulse to move. And there's a lot of Homework that I need to do here as you point out.  Ken: no problem take your time and ask questions as needed.  Joe: I've almost made up my mind but do have a question. The two candidate moves I have are 6.g3 and 6.e3 I'm not not sure which one is better though. If I fianchetto on g2 my only issue is the bishop being blocked by the Knight. But I see that it's happening with you so my guess is that it's not too problematic in this position. 6.e3 you said was a good move but my Bd4 is semi blocked. So I don't know if it's better to have a pawn blocked or a bishops diagonal blocked.  Ken: 6.e3 is better. Experience Indian systems over the years shows that it is best to fianchetto only one of the B pair. Since you have already fianchettoed the DSB the typical plan revolves around control of the dark squares. In practical play it is just too ambitious to try to control all the squares both light and dark.
502,16,8,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3B4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Joe: I'm shortly on but only to look at possiblities. That means that I'll be using just about as much time. And it's due to the work schedule tomorrow. Monday nights and Tuesdays in general is where I have the least amount of time to be on the computer due to the work schedule. In this position I considered 7.Nbd2 to complete development except that I don't want to exchange my Bd4 since that seems more important stronger then your Nc6. The question is where to retreat it. I'm thinking on c3. If I went back to b2 you could bring your Nc6-b4 which I'm afraid might have threats. It's certainly not immediate but what I'm trying to work on is figuring out what the board is telling me. What's indicated to me is that 7...Nb4 could get nasty. I think that to avoid complications 7.Bc3 might be the way to go. The only thing I don't like is the same as if Nc3 was played being that the c pawn is blocked which is why the General Guidelines says that in 1.d4 openings white shouldn't play Nc3 before the c pawn's been advanced. But I feel that Bc3 would do the same. While there are still questions and things to think about with the work schedule coming tomorrow which is typical on Tuesdays this is where I especially need more time.  Ken: You definitely want to avoid exchanging the DSB. It's not wekk placed on c3 it is also unprotected there.  Joe: I have given this a little more thought and realize that I don't have to let 7.Bb2 block in my Bishop since the plan is to get my Nb1-d2 at some point. This is tough to think about the best move but I've limited my candidate moves to 7.Bb2 or 7.Bc3 especially with what you noted about not wanting to exchange my Bd4 which was the last thing I'd want anyhow due to what tactical-abyss has previously outlined on the 1.d4 openings.  Ken: my vote would be Bb2 leaving open the possibility of playing c4 at a later time  Joe:  I agree. In fact that move was the same as what I was coming to mind anyhow.
503,16,9,d6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/8/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Joe: I gave this some thought but this time came up with a move that I like. I want to develop my Bf1 in order to castle. But where to? I was thinking of playing 8.Bb5 to pin your Nc6. Of course I know you can break with 8...Bd7 (which is my anticipation) but that's when I usually castle at once. Now one other thing I like the pin is because I thought of 8.Bc4 but then you can attack me at will with 8...d5 and then what? So I like 8.Bb5 the best so far.  Ken: Bb5 is a very reasonable choice study the variations after Qa5+ to make sure you have defenses before playing it  Joe: I don't think I do. I only saw move after 8...Qa5+ being 9.Nc3 but after 9...Ne4 I'm in trouble. Therefore I can't allow 8...Qa5+ so I believe that 8.Bc3 is a better move.  Ken: before you commit to Bc3 examine the positions you'd have after playing Bd2 or Be3 and then decide
504,16,10,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/8/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ -',Joe: I was worried that you'd play ...Qa5+ anyhow. I think that castling makes things easier for me. Like before there's not quite enough time to calculate but I'm the kind of person that enjoy's castling early. So I think that 9.0-0 would be the way to go especially when you count the fact that in most QPO's castling long is usually a bad idea.  Ken: now is an appropriate time to castle. not too early or too late
505,16,11,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/8/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Joe: With your d5 around I can't play 10.Nc3 but I'm thinking along the line of 10.Nbd2 to complete my development.  Ken: why can't you play 10.Nc3??  Joe: The problem is that if 10.Nc3 you have 10...d4. Now I can play 11.Nb5 to be chased again by 11...a6 But if I'm to avoid this I'm forced to cram my N with 11.Ne2 and I don't like being in that situation.  Ken: okay good answer

One move that I'm taking into consideration though is 11.Qe2 to mobilize my Queen and connect my Rooks.  Ken: There is nothing to attack at all. You need to play what the professional players call a 'high class waiting move.  Joe: I know about waiting moves but what is High Class?  Ken: very good  Joe:  Then I think that a High Class move which just came to mind is 11.Re1 It centralizes the Rook but also adds a defender should I decide to play e4. If I did that it would mean the loss of a pawn but the Rook there they just get exchanged.  I'm not sure but I'd say that it's the best move unless there's one that I'm missing which often happens to me.  Ken: It's reasonably good choice. I don't see anything that stands out as very much better.  
507,16,13,Be6,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2nqbnp1/3p4/8/1P1BPN2/PBPN1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Joe: I am thinking believe it or not 12.Qe2 to get the Rooks connected. The long term plan would be to double up but I'm not sure if it works here.  Ken: sounds like another good waiting move slightly bettering your position until lines of attack become clearer.

So it's about what Rook and I think that the best move in this position is 13.Rad1.  Ken: those are good chess thoughts.
509,16,15,Nb4,b'r2r2k1/pp2ppbp/3qbnp1/3p4/1n6/1P1BPN2/PBPNQPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: I am now thinking along the line of Ba3 to pin your N.  Ken: a worthwhile thought I've been trying to decide what I will do if you do that  Joe: Yes I'm thinking along the same lines of how you'd answer which is why I'm cautious. It's like I don't know but then try to do some difficult math. I would like to also get my Nd2-g3 at some point. But if I were to play Nf1 if I did that right away I'd be worried about tying down the Knight. There is so much to think about that nothing is easy. But I like positions that are difficult to figure out like this.

In fact I think it's the way to go for if I don't take you're going to knab my c2 or a2 pawn which I don't want to happen as I wind up a pawn down.  Ken: you are right that I will take if you don't

So I will go by a rule of thumb in terms of strategy by Susan Polgar. I'm considering 16.Nd4 keeping in mind that it's safe. And the plan behind this move is to enable my Nd2 to go to the f3 where it's in a better outpost due to strategic reasons since she mentioned that this is an important part of strategy.  Ken: sounds solid and quite safe

But I don't see it affecting my decision too quickly as there's no immeidate danger. Kind of a bizzarre comment but that's because I'm thinking of 17.Nf3 for the reason outlined on the move above as my Nd2 will be better placed.  Ken: that's what chess is all about getting your pieces to the right squares. You do that a lot you win a lot. If you don't you lose a lot.
513,16,19,Qd6,b'r2r2k1/pp1bppbp/3q1np1/3p4/3N4/1P1BPN2/P1P1QPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: I'm thinking along something unusual. As you might have seen in charleshiggies most recent annotation my thought process was wrong there. It started off with a Grunfeld Opening so I thought that a N was worth more. When I said that teardrop accurately pointed out that you need to decide when that advice is right. I'm not sure if it's works in this position but I am considering 18.Bb5 (to exchange that for my other N). The awkward part however is that I've exchanged one Knight for Bishop and question if I should do the second one or keep my LSB. I say that since an alternative would be 18.Nb5.  Ken: This is the correct question B or N. It is unclear to me which is better here. Sometimes it is a matter of taste. Which piece are you more skilled at using and what's your comfort level.  Joe: I'm more skilled with the N. For after the exchange it's not clear for me what my LSB can do and where I go from there. But with the Knight however Queen is under attack. But that's not even close for anything to be considered. But what is considered is the N maneuvered. Most importantly however is the pressure against your e5 pawn. Right now it is well defended. But if and when your Bd7 comes off the board and I've got the N there is the threat of pinning your Queen. It can be defended but there's still that added pressure. One of the things I was taught was to keep the pressure. With that being said although the second part is difficult to answer I am also more comfortable with the Knight in this particular position.
514,16,20,1Bb5,b'r2r2k1/pp1bppbp/3q1np1/1B1p4/3N4/1P2PN2/P1P1QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Ken: Trading either the B or N eases you task so at least for now I won't exchange pieces. A judgement of a type that all players face in almost every game  
515,16,21,1Bc8,b'r1br2k1/pp2ppbp/3q1np1/1B1p4/3N4/1P2PN2/P1P1QPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: Since they won't be exchanged it's a case of not really knowing what to do. But I'm thinking for a similar reason along the line of Ba4 The only thing I don't like about this is that it appears to be a waste of tempo but my plan is to renew the threat of the pin since my plan involves bringing my Nd4 to where my Bb5 is. Not really sure how to put it but I guess you can say reconfiguring those two pieces.  Ken: clearly such a re-positioning will be vital  Joe: In that case I think that Ba4 is the way to go because if I play Bd3 there is an interference as my Rd1 is blocked by own bishop. And the Rook is where the pin threat is taking place.  Ken: sounds like you've thought it out well
516,16,22,1Ba4,b'r1br2k1/pp2ppbp/3q1np1/3p4/B2N4/1P2PN2/P1P1QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Ken: things are getting more complicated. this is the main reason I refused the trade of B's to make things difficult. When this possible you don't exchange.
517,16,23,1a6,b'r1br2k1/1p2ppbp/p2q1np1/3p4/B2N4/1P2PN2/P1P1QPPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: I just learned something new. What I learned is that when things become complicated you don't want to exchange because you need those pieces.  For me it's also difficult because the pin is gone. Not to my surprise at all you read my mind. Now to calculate what to do. I think that I might be able to renew that threat though with 20.c4 Sure it can be prevented but there would be some pressure then towards the center.  Ken: It is a complicated path now much more so since I did accept the possible exchange of B's. It does revolve around c4 so take the time you need and think it through.  Joe: Don't need much more time. Although the thinking was good to an extent know it's important for you to know this as I was just starting to take things too far which is why I liked the advice of taking time. I realized that I had a similar impulsiveness with what you've seen which would've resulted in the loss of material. My thought was originally as noted trading pawns on c4 so that my Nd4 could move to c2 and threaten the pin. But what I almost overlooked there was something similar to what stalhandske made me do as Homework in the WTWLTR club during a vote game. As the problem here would be 20...b5 which at the very least loses a piece for a pawn since my Ba4 would be locked in. The bad part though is that I'm losing pawn since the only way to protect this is 20.b4 Were the d pawn not on d5 I'd have another option with the Queen. Therefore I'm still going down a pawn but it's better then a piece.  It's because I feel that the only way around this is 20.b4  Ken: make sure before you move. Like I said earlier this type of position is wh trading pieces down is the wrong idea sometimes. If you've got pressure on an opponent trading eases things for the opponent.  Joe: You are right and I see it can be defended though with 20.c4 because if you play 20...b5 I can take with the c pawn. And everything would still hold.  By still hold I mean that it remains level. In other words I don't lose anything.  Ken: I knew what you meant.

Difficult situation.  Were it not for the loss of a pawn I'd reattack your Queen with c5 since GM's and charleshiggie have done that. Of course that's overgeneralizing. So what else? I think that my only option is to cramp my Nd4 with Nc2.  Ken: playing c5 doesn't actually cost you a pawn right away because if you play c5 and I capture you can play Nxe5!  Joe:  Yes that's true. The question is if it will work here or if I have a better move. I do like that as now the Knight isn't cramped. But I think there's more to the story then meets the eye as my original goal was to pin the Queen. The question is am I going to lose that goal. With Nc2 there's still potential but the I ask myself what happens if your answer with e4 As of now there's more questions for me then answers until I unravel the mystery bits by bits. As you noted it's a very difficult position.  Ken: That's the whole point the stronger players increase the complexity of the position and challenge their opponents to figure it out.  Joe: So I gave this a little more thought. Both Nc2 and c5 are optional. I think that playing c5 is a better option because if 21.Nc2 black has 21...e4 which forces me to answer with 22.Nd2 And now both of my N's are cramped. After a loss combined with a different game I feel that this would give you a space advantage. But c5 should stop that in it's track.
520,16,26,2c5,b'r1br2k1/1p3pbp/p2q1np1/2Ppp3/B2N4/1P2PN2/P3QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Ken: I am not trading my e-pawn for your c-pawn. St least not at the moment. That would ease the tension in the position and if anything I want to increase tension so... Qe7

That does force me to cram my Nd4 though. As much as I hate being pesstimistic it's about reality which only gives me one option. That is 22.Nc2.  Ken: Certainly true that the N can't stay on d4 and c2 is the only available square. I'd call that completely forced.  Joe: I concur that it's forced.
522,16,28,2Nc2,b'r1br2k1/1p2qpbp/p4np1/2Ppp3/B7/1P2PN2/P1N1QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Ken: The pressure stays on.

I felt that the pressure was on before which would've led to some stress. My concern was 22...e4 after which I'd be forced to pull back. But the N moving there I think it's easy for me. Shouldn't be but that's how I feel. However I know why you played this as there is a N fork against my Q+R. That can easily be defended against with 23.Rd3  Ken: there's more to look at.  Joe: I'm definitely going to spend more time. I'd do it tonight but am going to have to log off because I need to get early tomorrow. But come tomorrow I'll spend possibly 2 hours trying to figure out what's going on here. I don't know what happens ...Rd3 is played but I sense that it cannot be good.   I agree actually as it also leaves my Nf3 pinned since black can play ...Bg4 And Qd3 leads to a half pin with ...Bg4 So that needs to be dealt with to. Despite that I think it could be a nuicanse. I believe that there's still more to look at but the main move I'm considering as of now is Rc1 so that if you play ...Nc3 I can still get out. But my thought is what happens if you pin the N. My take as of now is that there are more questions then answers here.  Ken: there are more questions than answers. That my friend is what pressure on your opponent is all about.  Joe: Ok what I discovered with this pressure is that I can't completely avoid the pin unless I give up my Queen or Rook to a Knight fork. But there is only option that prevents the worst of the fork as otherwise my Nf3 would be pinned to the Queen. But one move only leaves it pinned to the Rook which I guess you call a Half Pin. That move is Qd3.  Ken: keep thinking especially about what comes after your intended move Qd3.  Joe: After Qd3 I'm going down a pawn. I did look at another move with a bunch of variations but I'm not convinced that they work either. The move would be 23.Nb4 to allow the anticipated 23...Nc3 as a conditional move. For then I'd play 24.Nxd5 and after 24...Nxd5 I'd play 25.Qc4 to try and get something. The question is if I sacked would I be successful in getting something back with that line. One of my main problems which reversion PM's me and then cplusplus11 noted in an annotation is go through those lines and seeing if they can fail.  Ken: Materially the two lines will yield similar results. It then becomes a matter of judgement which do you prefer. One may lead to more exchanges than the other let's say. Is that good or bad?  Joe: That is good advice.  Yes that's the question. I don't think it's quite as good. Jack Stockel once told me to exchange when possible against stronger players. I ruled that out. That's tactical-abyss said that in most cases you shouldn't. I guess it's preference. I don't know if more exchanges is good or not.  Ken: After you've checked the varaiations for a while look at the mobility you have left. If one variation appears promising but leaves yopur pieces unable to
524,16,30,Nxc5,b'r1br2k1/1p2qpbp/p5p1/2npp3/B7/1P1RPN2/P1N1QPPP/4R1K1 w - -',Ken: When you can and here i could you should always try to play duaL purpose attacking moves. That's the reason I played Ne4 in the first place I have a primary threat on c3 and also a secondary threat on c5.  Joe: Does dual mean multiple? I ask because I have not term used in this context.  Ken: Yes it does mean multiple purpose. As you can see here my refusal to exchange pieces a few times is increasing the degree of difficulty. You are now facing four separate threats. I will let you analyse that a bit.  You cansee now very clearly ehy I refused exchanging pieces. The degree of difficulty has jumped so high that you have to analyze 4 distinct threats: I can play 24...NxR 24...NxB 24..e4 or 24...b5. That is a lot for you to chew on since only 3-4 moves ago the pressure was minimal.  Joe: That means that I've had to have made a mistake with that c pawn. Yes and this will take time.  What I know right now is that I can't prevent a total loss. Meaning: That I'm going to lose something. But I can minimize the damage and prevent you from getting anything for free. It would be at the cost of a pawn. I think that 24.Nd2 is the way to go here.  Ken: Consider what would happen after 24.Nd2 b5 before you decide about this sequence  And consider that if I play 24....NxR I can still play b5 after you recapture on d3.  Joe: You are right. There's more cons then pros. The only way to prevent that is b4. In fact that's the best move because say you play that and I pull back then you take the Rook and I capture the N then white has lost another piece yet. Though the trouble's there. My thought is alleviating the problems.  Ken: You will need to be your best at damage control here. I suggest you count the pieces carefully and assess each variation writing it all down in a note to yourself before you decide.  Joe:  I will but in starting to calculate variations I think that Nb4 is probably the way to minimize the damage.  Ken: It is your decision my advice is to be careful & methoidical.

But I can defend here. The only problem now is this threat. But I think that it's not serious as of the moment.  Ken: well be sure before you move  Joe: Not completely out of the woods but I think I can save the position with Qd3.  Ken: you are right the woods are still thick and mysterious. Qd3 is unclear if it's the best but it is reasonable in a position where most choices are bad.

The only way to keep damage minimal is Bxb5 For if I don't take that Bishop is a freebie and I don't like giving anything without something in return which is already what happened with the pawn.  Ken: you will get some compensation probably not enough but make the best you can out of it. Joe: I agree. Yes it's not enough but I can get two pawns though with that move.
527,16,33,axb5,b'r1br2k1/4qpbp/6p1/1p1pp3/4n3/1P1QPN2/P1N2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: This is going to be a difficult one to analyze as we're not talking about pieces here. It's a question if 27.Qxb5 or 27.a3 are better. 27.a3 protects the a pawn. But if I capture on b5 it becomes an exchange. It's pawns but the question is should I exchange or not as it boils down to those 2 moves.  Ken: there's more you should also analyze whether a move such as Ba6 will bring harm to you Q after she takes on b5. I've been looking at that and trying to decide how well it actually works.  Joe: That would cause a lot of harm as at the very least I'm forced to liquidate Queens. The only way to stop that is by giving up another pawn 27.b5 For if you played 27...Ba6 that pawn won't be able to advance further and threaten the Queen like that.  Ken: I was thinking more in terms of trying to trap your Q  Joe: Yes and I don't want that Queen trapped. I think that b4 might be the only way to stop it. There might be other alternatives. But I see a very limited amount of options in this position.   I'm also thinking of 27.Qxb5 to prevent you from trapping my Queen. A possible continuation would be 27...Ba6 28.Qb6 Rdb8 29.Qc6 Bb7 30.Qb5 Ba6 The only problem with this line is that my Queen must constantly run back. I think that b5 might be better to keep the Queen safe without loss of tempo.  Ken: I'm not surprised that you knew that about the comments. In this type of attack there are multiple threats even now. That is what makes the attack particularly effective. How you noticed that even withe threats revolving around b5 there are still other threats lurking for example what happens if I play Bf5? This is a type of attack you need to understand to advance as a player. Single variation attacks are too easy to defend but multiple variation attacks are much more powerful.  Joe: You are right but no matter how bad the situation is ironically I've learned overtime not to be afraid. As that has triggered the Fight or Flight syndrome which has caused me to rush. So although I don't like exposing the K as per what Jack has outlined. I'm thinking of 27.g6 to that attack. And now if 27...Ba6 I can stop Ba6 as well with 28.Nb4 And I feel much safer. The only issue is the exposed K but I'd take it over losing my Queen.  Ken:  I think you have mistyped here you can't play g6 to stop my B from going to f5  Joe: It was because I reversed colors. In that case it's going to have to be 27.Qxb5 as they stop both threats. That's because if 27...Bf5 is no longer a threat against the Queen. And if 27...Ba6 I run back with the same moves. So I thinking taking puts an end to what's coming.  Forgot to mention but if after 27.Qxb5 you played 27...Ba6 my answer would be to attempt to exchange Queens with 28.Qb4 since it's not lost with my Nc2 which is something that I overlooked when commenting earlier.   I hope that I'm not missing anything at this point.  Ken: I always hope that!
528,16,34,Ba6,b'r2r2k1/4qpbp/b5p1/1Q1pp3/4n3/1P2PN2/P1N2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: As noted yes this move was anticipated. But this is where I realize that Qb4 keeps me safe for now. I absolutely don't like liquidating when behind. But when you mentioned about the Q before and those variations that's when I figured out that there weren't options here.  There actually is a move that I missed over what happens if one of your Rooks is brought to b8 to attack my Queen. But my answer would later be Qa4 as keeps it safe.  I meant Qa3 as that's where the N would protect it.  Ken: Now another decision where doesthe Q go? I would say you be looking at b4 b6 and c6 mostly  Joe: Yes. The move that I looked at was b4. But I thought I overlooked one of your Rooks going to b8. Except that if it did that I'd get a free Queen. Which I know you're not going to do. If however I played I brought it to b6 or c6 however then you could attack it with your Rook. And that is me trying to calculate many variations with the way that you mentioned. So I think that best Qa4 here.  Edit: I meant Qb4.  Ken: I have not doubt that you meant Qb4.
529,16,35,2Qb4,b'r2r2k1/4qpbp/b5p1/3pp3/1Q2n3/1P2PN2/P1N2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Ken: I am stubbornly sticking to my no exchanges plan.  At least no equal exchanges.
530,16,36,2Qe6,b'r2r2k1/5pbp/b3q1p1/3pp3/1Q2n3/1P2PN2/P1N2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Joe: Which makes the threats worse then anticipated. With that being said another problem I have on top of not calculating multiple variations is that I've been known to underestimate how bad the situation is. A good example was in my most recent game against bhidragon. I was hyperfocused on center control and developing my Nb8-c6 in the Semi Slav QGD. Now that hyperfocus is what led to me underestimating how bad the situation was with his attacking forces against my monarch. In doing so my opponent gave me a B for pawn as he had a mating attack. The advice was the overall seeing the overall picture of how the game is developing after annotating that game. But part of what hinders is thinking that the situation isn't as bad as it is. I'm afraid that's what might have happened here.  In theory I might be able to change that and force an exchange by attacking your Queen with Ng5. I am afraid though of Qf6. This is a very interesting position.  Ken: In aiming for g5 you are forgetting that my N can move from e4 backwards to g5. This is quite a common error. I've done it myself a few times. You can get so locked in on pieces moving forward that you forget they can move backward to good effect as well.  Joe: Yes so I've ruled it out. I'll try to find a better move. Normally I'd calculate right away and try to find something then. In fact I don't want to exchange now due to being behind which is why I'm glad that you played ...Qe6. But as you said it's a difficult position. This is pressure as I don't know what move to do here. And you noted that this is what's all about which I'm feeling here.  Allright as I have more time. I've given this a little more thought. Believe though quite terrible 29.Rd3?? came into considertation with the idea of trying to put pressure on your Nd3 as the plan would to be coordinate my Q and Rd1. With that being said yes I almost overlooked Bxd3 So although I dislike exchanging when behind the only move I can think of is 29.Nd2 And if we exchange I feel that the pressure would be off. As otherwise I don't know what to play.  Ken: If you ploay 29.Nd2 my response won't be an immediate capture I will play 29..Bf8 which will cause you some trouble.  Joe: I don't want that since my Queen is badly attacked. That means that the overall picture is how to prevent that. It doesn't help the pressure much but I think that 29.Qa3 would be the way to go. And if you discovered attack by moving your Ba6 I can quick play 30.Qc1  Ken: just make sure you understand all this before you pick your move.  Joe: Ok. Gave it more time and realized that I'd lose a piece though. But I found one move that gets me out of trouble.

Ken: you will have some compensation but not enough.  Joe: Yes I can with bxc4 but it won't do much. I'll continue unless you think I should resign. And I say that because of what you noted in one of my recent annotations. In that case even though I said lasting as long as possible it was to sastisfy the WTW rules in order to avoid being questioned by the mods as it happened in one case when I felt that there was nothing to learn. But this is not one of those games. So if you think I should I will resign. If not I'll stay in.  Ken:  If you consider that you are still learning don't resign yet. Just don't regard the length of the games as particularly meaningful. I assume you will most likely play Qxa8 followed by bxc4 which would give you some experience with R and B for the queen. I will still be ahead Q for R but the change in material status will be educational for you.  Joe:  I was actually considering bxc4 with ...Rxa4 to follow. But I made a similar mistake against easy19. Taking right away does limit the damage because as you noted I get a Rook in return.

I am however considering Nc2 as my N is a little more active. That's the best that I can think of in this situation.  The question is what can I do here. One move that I was considering was Nd2. Except that I don't want to exchange when behind. I would've however played Rc1 in an attempt to win your c4 which you just defend after ...c3 It really boils down to what to do. I'm considering either Nc2 or Nd2.  Ken: At some point you will have to play Nc2 but it isn't required just yet  Joe: I realized though that in this position Re2 is required as my a3 is en-prise. And that's also due to the fact that Rd2?? doesn't work because of your Ne4. So bringing the Re1 to the second rank from how I see it is a must.  Ken: If you play Re2 my response will be Nc3  Joe:  Then the pawn cannot be protected. So the move I'm now considering is Rb1 with the idea being Rb7 on the next move to attempt to put pressure on your f7 pawn.  Ken:  You are right the pawn cannot be saved but it does have one use. If you move it to a3 or a4 you slightly delay my R going to a2 and that helps a little. The position is very difficult for you at this point nearly hopeless. At this point you defense is based on the term I disliked many months ago ""hope chess"". You will need a crude blunder from me to get to equality.That might happen in blitz at times but when I have several days to check out each move the chances of a crude blunder are very small. I have made one such blunder here on gameknot. I misread my notes and moved a R to c4 when I meant c5 even then I did not lose the game. I you still feel you are learning something play on further by all means. Don't think of the length of the game as important though. What's important from this game is that you are learning to think about your future moves in regards to multiple threats and that you have learned not to exchange pieces as readily as you sometimes have done in the past. See if you can get Yuri Averbakh's ""Chess Endings Essential Knowledge"" from your local library. You may never use some of the endgame knowledge in it but it will help you to know which endgame positions are won and which are not. This knowledge will help you make better decisions when faced with exchanges."

But once the pawn goes that's when I'll resign.  In fact I'll continue until you feel that there is nothing for me to learn anymore.  Since you took anyway I'll play Rc1. It's hope chess allright as I'm I will attempt to complicate the position.  In fact I'll continue until you feel that there is nothing for me to learn anymore.  Since you took anyway I'll play Rc1. It's hope chess allright as I'm I will attempt to complicate the position.  Ok I misread the note. I don't think there is anything left to learn unless we discuss other moves and maybe I get something out of that just like before. Otherwise I'm probably going to resign. I wasn't going to except that taking on a4 wasn't delayed so I think that if anything there's not much to learn anymore from this game. I like this moral and if you check out my most recent annotation not only didn't I see multiple threats. But I did not even attempt to consider more then one variation because I underestimated the position. And he had pressure that I didn't realize or feel since it's about not knowing what to do. But I figured and was condident that I did which is why variations weren't considered. But that ultimately sealed my fate and got me mated very quickly.  Ken: You are right that there is nothing left to be learned in this game.  we can start another after I take some time to think about lesson number 2.  Joe: Ok. Resignation for me is imminent. I don't mind starting another one.

The real reason behind this move is that he's forced to capture away from the center.  And I kept in mind the saying that you should capture towards as opposed to away from the center.  By being comfortable and what I'm used as far as I'm concerned I have a small advantage which the idea is to capitalize.  However there's only so far that this could go.

The reason for playing is the same as how I wound up blundering.  Now I thought it was for center but it's actually for a similar reason which helps but it's about safely bringing my Nb1 into play.  That's because the idea is that in 1.d4 openings it should not be developed on c3 until you've advanced the c2 pawn.  And that is exactly why this is played.

The thing is that Jack Stockel is known to have glacoma as otherwise I wouldn't have considered with.  And with problems in his vision he has made a blunders as we saw a week ago and then the time before.  That was when I won his Rook for a piece.  Therefore I didn't forget but rather ignored that ""To take is a mistake.""  That's because I assumed that his glacoma got the best of him and therefore made a mistake that lost his pawn.  It turns out that is where that pompous attitude is costly.  Similar to what we saw with bhidragon he gave this pawn away for a reason.  It turns out that by taking my Queen is likewise out of play.  And I'm now busted.    I was just focused on taking advantage of Jack being forced to capture away from the center which made me believe that I was gaining an edge.  But we discussed it and he said that there was no need to capture because that was a week.  Instead his h pawn was the real danger.  With best I'm going to lose two pieces.  Therefore he said that best was 16.f3 as not only is the Queen still in play but it's more active right near the monarch (that's under attack.)"

When discussing how 16.Qxa6?? lost he said that when you're trouble don't attack defend.  But after we said goodbye God spoke to me and I wound up thinking about this at work for the first 195 minutes of my shift and had a break down.  So what led me getting in trouble in the first place?  It was what happened in the first and as bhidragon previously noted the way I was thinking.  It's true that I go wrong by not seeing the entire story the board reveals.  But it's not due to my bag of chess quotes as he said.  Instead it's the attitude of I'll play based on what suits my style and what I'm comfortable with despite being corrected so many times over the past few years.  The idea being is that back then (well before kenneth_fiore_3) unless it was Jack Stockel tactical-abyss archduke_piccolo  I'll only listen to everyone if it's in my comfort zone where I feel comfortable and if it's what I'm used to.  If not I'll ignore it.  This is also why I was pompous and impulsive and just did what my heart told me without thinking twice about it.  And showing off happened even after receiving challenges dmaestro elyhim schakertje thereaper1 and even bhidragon in our regular.  Now Dragon said that he was interested in how I was playing these days.  But after a pm over what he saw in my annotations for years my guess is that he was interested due to me showing off because that's how the other challenges start.  However I'm very unusual because after losing even that recent I still just did things my way and when they worked out I had that big shot attitude.  But this game makes history because it was not a challenge due to showiness.  It was normal training yet that same attitude occured which led to my downfall.  Ok so what goes into my thought process and why do I think like that?  It's because when I'm corrected it's usually in third as opposed to second person mode.  So when they make recommendations but it's for jkarp instead of second person which would be me (although it's meant to be constructive I get embarassed and humilated).  That's how I still wind up acting out on impulse in my play and then being look what I accomplish.  However the reason for feeling this way is because back in my days of High School people were using third character mode.  The idea however was to make me feel embarrased so they could get attention.  What I learned is two things.  First when being corrected in third person I just have to pretend that it's second person since it really boils down to ""You say tomato and I say tomatto.""  Second even if you like to do what things you're way because it's comfortable it's also important to ""get of your comfort zone.""  So even if there are some things that I'm not comfortable it's important to save position because it's about the story that the board reveals since chess is a language."

That's because GM Susan Polgar has also told me to play what I'm most comfortable.  Quite frankly before being given that advice it's one of the main ways as I've improved.  Back in the day I changed my thought process in a way that I wasn't comfortable with as per a coaches advice.  That however hindered my improvement and was a reason for reaching my lowest rating of 851. So after going back to square one (where I was most comfortable) that's what helped me surpass the 1000 mark.  And it's another reason for me coaching and mentoring players with another idea being that the students are comfortable.  Not only that but one or two of them have also improved from that alone.

569,18,12,1Qe2,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/np2p3/4P1b1/1BNPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Knowing that it can't be broken without opening up my monarch (after what happened in the horrible loss against Jack) I decide to mobilize my Queen.
570,18,13,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1p2n2/np1pp3/4P1b1/1BNPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',He opts for an exchange which I accept.  That's because I'm pretending that I have an advantage.  In reality however I'm well aware that it's level.  But my idea is lasting as long as possible.  The goal is 26 since that's how well in the hardest level of Wizard Chess.  And as noted I accomplish my goal with this unusual attitude.  It's unusual because one of my mentors said that I wouldn't improve much especially since I'm deviating from some of what he told me.  Therefore the thought process is actually what he has outlined.  But as noted it's what I'm most comfortable and by thinking this way I get a very good game in this context and am thus proud of myself.  It's not that often that I can think the way I enjoy (my style) and play so well against someone of this strength.

And that was placing it on the rim with 16.Na4  This would've been better believe it or not.  But I was afraid of losing my Knight after 16...Qa5  However if I played let's supposed 17.Nc5 I've got a nice discovered attack on his Queen.  Afterwhich I'd be able to protect my Knight.
574,18,17,1h6,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/p4n1p/3pp1B1/1p4b1/1P1P1N2/1PP1QPPP/R2N1RK1 w - -',I was surprised to see him play this.

But I overlooked the story that the board was telling me which is important.  I originally thought that I was safe and it's even bottom line.  But the problem is the pinned Knight.  With that I'm now bound to lose a piece.  Best was 17.Bxf6 and after 17...Bxf6 or 17...gxf6 18.h4 and now it can retreat or we continue with 18...Bxf3 19.Qxf3 where it remains level.  By playing this he gets the initiative without compensation.
576,18,19,exf3,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/p4n1p/8/1p4b1/1P2Np2/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - -',As this is the consequence of playing 17.Bd2??

As a result I'm going to apply what I learned from Jack Stockel which is that part of K safety is bringing it into the corner.  It applies here since his target is g1.  We know as otherwise he would not have left his Be7 en-prise.  That's because I thought about taking it but realized that especially in this position ""To take is a mistake"" because of how the game is developing.  Afterall his intentions are 23...Nh5 followed by 24...Qg7+ 25.Kh1 (forced) Qg2#  I had a similar threat against Jack Stockel with his two pins and then Tom.  The moral to both games is that the monarch has to land in the corner when you have a threat like this."

Therefore my thought was him retreating and my next move being 27.Rd3 or 27.Rd2  By playing this I wind up losing my Rook for a Bishop and a pawn in addition to what I've already lost.
586,18,29,2Qg6,b'r3r1k1/5pp1/p5qp/N1bn4/1p1R4/1P2BP1b/1PP1QP1P/R6K w - -',That's due to the mate threat he has on g2.  With that there's no other way out because 27.Bg5?? loses an additional piece.  Afterwhich the same thing that happens now would've occurred a move after putting me in much worse shape.
587,18,30,3Qg2,b'r5k1/5pp1/p5qp/N1b5/1p4P1/1P2r3/1PP3QP/R6K b - -',Feeling that aside from loss of material my position is safe I try to protect whilst attempting counterplay due to his Ra8 being attacked.

591,18,34,Qxe1+,b'4r1k1/5pp1/p6p/N1b5/1p4P1/1P6/1PP3QP/4q2K w - -',This however is where I resign because he'll mate.  As now 34.Qg1 is forced allowing 34...Qxg1#  Once again I'm proud of how long I lasted.  And this shows that despite my ratings remaining the same for the last few months that I have improved.  That's because I lasted 23 moves in my last game against easy19.  Shortly after that I lasted 26 moves in the recent Wizard Chess.  I'm confident that sooner then later I'll be able to surpass that 36 mark and even make it to 40 moves against strong opposition like this.

653,21,11,a4,b'rnbq1rk1/3p1ppp/1p1b1n2/2pPp1B1/p1B1P3/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I moved my E knight to g3 and black pushed his a pawn again to a4.

655,21,13,b5,b'1nbq1rk1/3p1ppp/3b1n2/rppPp1B1/p1B1P3/P4NN1/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I moved my queen to e2 protecting my LB at c4.  Black pushes his pawn down the b file attacking my LB.

660,21,18,Ba6,b'1n1q1rk1/3p1ppp/b2b1n2/r2Pp1B1/p3P3/pp4N1/B1PNQPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I move my f3 knight to d2 attacking the b3 pawn.  Black moves his LB to a6 now pointing at my queen on e2.  Its a party on the a file!
661,21,19,bxa2,b'1n1q1rk1/3p1ppp/b2b1n2/r2Pp1B1/p3P3/p4QN1/p1PN1PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I move my queen out to f3 and black takes LB with b pawn and now there are 3 pawns on the 'A' file!  At this stage black could have taken my F rook with his bishop and that would have left me with a pawn ab out to take my B rook so would have created difficulties.  When I look at my king side I see I cannot progress with the queen still at d8 so I would have been hoping that my opponent would move this soon!  There was the f5 square for my knight which would be safe. 
662,21,20,Qb6,b'1n3rk1/3p1ppp/bq1b1n2/r2Pp1B1/p3P3/p4QN1/p1PN1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I move my b rook to a1 blocking 'A' pawns.  Black brings queen to b6 and takes control of b file.  Now the queen has moved so I can start my attack while keeping things on queenside held back.
663,21,21,Bb4,b'1n3rk1/3p1ppp/bq3n2/r2Pp1B1/pb2P3/p4QN1/R1PN1PPP/5RK1 w - -',I take pawn at a2 with my rook and black moves DB down to protect a3 pawn and attacking my knight at d2.
664,21,22,Bc5,b'1n3rk1/3p1ppp/bq3n2/r1bPp1B1/p3P3/p1P2QN1/R2N1PPP/5RK1 w - -',I move pawn to c3 and attack DB at b4 which moves back to c5.  My pawn was protected by queen at f3.  I am not sure I was aware when the bishop went to c5 of the implication to f2.  However I knew my next move would be rook to b1 and the black queen would be at risk so was not concerned about attack on f2.  If black had proceeded with this move then it would have changed things.  Queens would have been exchanged and game would definitely have gone a different way.
665,21,23,Qc7,b'1n3rk1/2qp1ppp/b4n2/r1bPp1B1/p3P3/p1P2QN1/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',I now move 'F' rook across to b1 and take control of b file protected by knight at d2 so black queen moves away to c7.  If I was black I would have moved my a5 rook out to b5 as it was protected by a6 and put up a fight for the b file.  If black had got the DB at c5 out of the way the queen would have been able to get down the c file and defend.  I am not sure the pawns were worth fighting over while the king was left with a knight and a rook.
666,21,24,Bd4,b'1n3rk1/2qp1ppp/b4n2/r2Pp1B1/p1PbP3/p4QN1/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',I move my pawn to c4 and DB moves down to d4 attacking f2 pawn.  The knight at d2 and my c4 pawn are a great pair as the a6 LB is thwarted by this move and if the LB were to move to b7 would only be blocked by pawns on the h1 to a8 diagonal.
667,21,25,d6,b'1n3rk1/2q2ppp/b2p1n2/r2PpNB1/p1PbP3/p4Q2/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',I move my g knight to f5 threatening to take pawn at g7 or checking at d7 but queen would capture so this move is not available.  Black moves pawn to d6 which allows queen to protect pawn at f7 and to cover d7 and e7 squares.
668,21,26,Bxc4,b'1n3rk1/2q2ppp/3p1B2/r2PpN2/p1bbP3/p4Q2/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',I take black's f6 knight with my DB and now attacking g7.  Black moves his LB to d4 attacking my rook at a2.
669,21,27,Kh8,b'1n3r1k/2q2ppp/3p1B1N/r2Pp3/p1bbP3/p4Q2/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',With my next move I move my knight to h6 checking the king who moves out of check to h8.  I did not leave my queen on f3 as my DB was still there but I could have moved up to f5 but I may have been concerned that queen would have been under attack where on g3 black pawns were shielding the queen.  I knew I could take LB with my d2 knight but this piece was occupied with covering the B rook.  I was getting ready for mate so did not see any reason for captures at this stage.
670,21,28,gxf6,b'1n3r1k/2q2p1p/3p1p1N/r2Pp3/p1bbP3/p5Q1/R2N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Black captures my DB with g7 pawn and I move my queen to g3 attacking h8.
671,21,29,f5,b'1n3r1k/2q2p1p/3p3N/r2Ppp2/p1bbP3/R5Q1/3N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Black has not had a chance to take my rook on a2 and I now capture another pawn at a3.  Black moves down one of his doubled pawns on f file to f5.
672,21,30,Bc5,b'1n3r1k/2q2p1p/3p4/r1bPpN2/p1b1P3/R5Q1/3N1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',I capture f5 pawn with my knight and black moves his DBfrom d4 to c5.  Also the DB is now attacking my rook at a3.

674,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a very short game with white rather surprisingly getting mated!
675,22,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.

678,22,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White develops her other knight.
679,22,5,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I keep my options open.
680,22,6,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',And white transposes now into the Open Sicilian.
681,22,7,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So I take.
682,22,8,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',She takes back.
683,22,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I continue to develop with the main line.
684,22,10,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',She continues with the Richter-Rauzer Attack probably the strongest line for white.
685,22,11,e6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',And this is the most common reply although other moves are quite playable.

694,22,20,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pppn2/6B1/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Which drops back.
695,22,21,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',This seems a sensible move stopping e4-e5. Normally in the Open Sicilian this moves leaves a weakness on the d5 square but here thanks to white exchanging on c6 there is no weakness and black can plan to play d6-d5 with a very strong centre.
696,22,22,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/4PP2/2NB4/PPP3PP/R2QR1K1 b - f3',This is the first move that has not been in either of the databases. It is a normal attacking move for white in the Open Sicilian but here there are problems. OK stop and consider what you would play as black?
697,22,23,1Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pp4/4p1B1/4PPn1/2NB4/PPP3PP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Is that the move you would play? Initially I looked at 12. Qb6+ forking the king on g1 and the pawn on b2 but then I wondered if this was even strong. There are many threats for white to deal with.
698,22,24,1Bxe7,b'r2q1rk1/p2bBppp/2pp4/4p3/4PPn1/2NB4/PPP3PP/R2QR1K1 b - -',White doesn't seem to understand the threat.

My first annotation of 2016!  Sadly my Big Slump (with the exception of some bright interludes) has persisted.  I simply cannot stop the silly mistakes from happening!  In this game it is no different.  After a solid Philidor Defense I end up losing a pawn without any compo and I did not even notice it was en prise.  Thankfully I kept Henry upright because I somehow ended up in an endgame with opposite coloured bishops and despite losing a second pawn I got away with conceding a Low Draw.  So how did all this happen?  Well read on ......"

He would sometimes follow it up with f4 attacking the e4 pawn from a different angle to wrest control of the board from white.  However it didn't quite happen in this game.

Yes a draw offer because Henry cannot be prevented from going to g6 to guard the h5 pawn.  Even if white were to trade pawns then all Henry has to do is to move onto h7 blocking the white passer and Henry cannot be moved from h7 due to white having the wrong coloured bishop.  On the queenside white can never interfere with Fou Leblanc's movements along the a8-h1 diagonal.  This will prevent white's c pawn from making any progress.  I explained this to my opponent in the chat and he accepted my draw offer - wheew and double wheew!

I almost played 8.dxe5 with the idea of getting into a line similar to the exchange variation.  Then I gave it more thought and took into account what GM Susan Polgar said about the French Defense which I saw from tactical-abyss.  However this happened before cplusplus11 told me not to do single move attacks for the thrills of it.  While most chess terms stay the same this is why I eliminated the tempo gain as that has also caused me to miss the entire story that the board was telling me.  Therefore what Susan said in the French is that d5 is often played to attack black's Nc6 and when it retreats white is also left with a solid pawn chain.  That's the idea of attacking the Knight.  Now that I've eliminated that the next I go through a similar line that's not the French I'll take on e5 instead.
911,31,9,Nd4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p2p1n2/3Pp3/B2nP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This is where the N often retreats.  And as you might guess an exchange often happens because as usual white will win a pawn.

This happened for an unusual reason which I find frustrating because this has caused me to blunder in two other games.  But I missed the overall picture in one of them which directly led to a loss.
913,31,11,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2pP4/B3P3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',? Although not quite as bad since my GK games were postponed I was still spending too much focusing on going away.  As noted I was thinking on how to get enough sleep for Sunday so that I could study the Susan Polgar book and stay awake.  Now this game happened 2 days prior to me going away.  However as we see here the distraction wasn't quite as bad as otherwise I would've lost my Queen since the focus would've been on developing my DSB.  This means that I would've likely played 11.Bg5?? had the distraction been what it was in the other two games.  But best was the immediate 11.dxc6 e.p. winning a pawn.  He can answer with 11...bxc6 but then I would've answered with 12.Bxc6  This time overlooking that is directly due to that distraction and be it note that things were getting rough already.  That's because I still had a little packing to do.  And when I was done I had to get ready for work the next night.  And after coming home at close to 10:30 pm there was still a small amount more packing.  Had to go to bed and then wake up at 6:15 am on Sunday Feb. 14 to catch my flight.

However this could've been done earlier but my response will still be the same.  Here's another thing after the mistake which I felt should've cost me the win I woke up and smell the coffee realizing what I had done.  So I stopped thinking about the vacation and went right back to the game.  It was basically practice as otherwise I would've been distracted at work which is even worse.
915,31,13,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p2p1n2/1ppP4/4P3/1BN5/PPPQ1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Completing his development.

However this was also played in anticipation of what Loyd winds up playing next.  I asked myself what would happen if he played this and could I defend my Bb3.  After remembering Jack's advice to ""Start Thinking"" which I've emphasized to my students I determined that this was only the way to prevent the loss of a piece."

And that's where I analyzed where the GM's do it without overgeneralizing as now as now I'm not concerned about anything he might be capable of doing.  That's because from here on in I come up with plans to stop it ahead of time.
921,31,19,1b4,b'2r2rk1/1q1bbppp/p2p1n2/1p1P4/1Pp1P3/P1N1B3/B1P1QPPP/R4RK1 b - b3',By block his b pawn.  Normally I don't care about this because it's not a passed pawn.  But the problem is his Bd7.  I thought that if he could push b5-b4 once I took Loyd would answer with ...Ba4 which I was determined to prevent.  However I forgot that my Nc3 stops that anyhow.  So overlooking that was also due to that small distraction I had.  It's not that small in reality but I was comparing it to how bad it was in other two games as this was way less.  The good news however is that it was my last game until a few days after coming back from Florida which was on I believe it was the 23rd of February.

And I saw a similar pattern to what happened in our most recent game because his Bd7 Nf6 and Queen could all be nasty threats.  I asked myself what he was going for in this position.  I think his first instinct is 21...Ng4 which could be nasty especially if his Bishop and Queen work with it.
927,31,25,2Rfe1,b'2r2rk1/3b1ppp/pq1p1n2/1p1P4/1Pp1P3/P1N5/B1PQ1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',So I centralize a Rook.  The idea being is that if he plays 21...Ng4 I'll answer with 25.Re3 followed by 26.Rg3 to stop any threat that he might have.

933,31,31,2e5,b'5rk1/3b1ppp/pq1p1nr1/1p1PP3/1Pp5/P1N5/B1PQRPPP/4R1K1 b - -',As now I use that time to fork his d6 and Nf6.  I also kept in mind that it's not very effective but that's almost irrelevant because everything is planned for once he retreats to  g4 I'll exchange pawns.
934,31,32,2g3,b'5rk1/3b1ppp/p2q2r1/1p1P4/1Pp3n1/P1N3P1/B1PQRP1P/4R1K1 b - -',But what I did not count was the mate threat.  Therefore I had to open up.  But this game happened before the recent life changing game with Jack where I realized that a pompous attitude was no way to become a better a chess player.  In other words it's also how I figured out that improvement meant that I needed to change my thought process afterall.  I wish it happened after that game because archduke_piccolo told me that f4 is preferred because this is right near the King.  Therefore it's the pawn that should not be advanced after castling unless you must do so.  Had this game happened afterwards I would've answered with 27.f4.

But in this context knowing the threat I play Hope Chess.  I wasn't sure what to do or how to counter the threat which caused a ""Fight or Flight"" syndrome which chess is not supposed to be.  Therefore the idea was to counter this threat by attacking his Queen.  That's because instead of attempting calculations on how to prevent the threat I'm just hoping that he won't play 28...Qf5  But the plan does not work.  Keep in mind that although not distracted from vacation anymore I was also trying to prevent history from repeating due to what happened before.  However I missed it but best was 28.h3 to prevent the threat.  As now 28...Qf5?? no longer works.  Therefore it's safe to say that I was still not completely with it and therefore somewhat distracted."

However the answer is still there but the difference being now is that black would've had ...Qxh3 followed by ...Rh6 and then ...Qh1# which is mate.  That was something that should've been considered.  I hope that I'm not in this situation again.  Normally going away and planning for the next day doesn't get to me.  The difference in this case was having to work late the night before.  And if there were choices on when the chess club takes place I would've done it earlier. However it's only held on Friday's.

After this game however Jack went back in time.  Seeing that he could've done something different Mr. Stockel made us continue the game as Homework.  But this time it was like the game I continued with easy19 against Jack himself.  In that game after losing to Mr. Stockel which Fred deemed as early due to not following the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules which is not resigning until mate can be forced he continued.  But in this case I played with Jack's pieces and he played as mine.  So we reversed colors and I made a mistake that could've turned that win into a loss.  A similar story is true here but he took over.  Therefore I kept the same color but Mr. Stockel played as black and made Loyd watch it.  Now he explained that best was to open up with 30...h6 so that his Rook Rf8 isn't tied up.  From there I played 30.Rxf8 and as anticipated he answered with 30...Kxe8.  But later on I made a mistake that could've lost since Jack got got two passed pawns and used them to advance.  With this Homework he was teaching us that it was a close game so white also had to be careful.  What was also being stressed is that the position would hold if black could exchange Rooks as 30...h6 was the only way to do so.  So one mistake from either side could lose very quickly.  Afterwards Loyd told me that he considered playing h6 for the same reasons that he mentioned and that the idea was playing the way Jack showed.  Afterwhich I agree that he might have won seeing the mistake I made against Jack.  With that being said the moral of this story is what the mentor told Loyd.  In it Jack said ""Once the Rooks are doubled up try to break them up."""

I like to try different things that I haven't done before since for me I'm used to responding after the Ruy Lopez.  What I like about the defense is that it doesn't just start off with a conventional opening but this also enables me to open up a diagonol for my Bc8.  The idea is center control.  That was based on some games that I've studied in elyhim's past annotations since he mentioned things similar like controlling the center right in the beginning.  I should point out that this game happened before Terence's most recent annotation but that was also mentioned.  And he implied that having the center controlled first and leaving it that way is generally how a game develops.

However I learned that this plan is problematic when tactical-abyss talked about Knights being worth more then bishops in 1.d4 openings because they're closed positions.  But 1.e4 is open so I wound up losing an exchange.  It's not always the case but usually we need the bishop when the position is open like this.
975,33,4,Nf5,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/3p1n2/2p2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Which he takes advantage of to develop.
976,33,5,Qc7,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/3p1n2/2p2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',One wouldn't think so but the harsh reality is that my d6 was under attack and therefore needed protection.  I originally thought that 9.Nxd6 isn't so bad because black could answer with 9...Bxd6 but what it boils down to is his Queen which is why I need that extra defender.
977,33,6,O-O,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/3p1n2/2p2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Meanwhile he castles.
978,33,7,g6,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1p1p/3p1np1/2p2N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?? But I was too hyperfocused on finding a good outpost for my Bishop and castling short.  Much better however was 9...0-0-0 at once.  Now I wind up in a lot of trouble and he takes away my castling rights.  In doing so my monarch will wind up under siege with a very small chance to save the position.  But castling on the opposite wing would've taken care of the problem as this will enable him to win material.  And by not castling my monarch will wind up exposed.  So this turns out to be a serious blunder.  Instead the focus needed to be on what was happening and what to do in that situation.  By failing to castle I've set myself up for disaster.
979,33,8,1Nb5,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1p1p/3p1np1/1Np2N2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',And it starts with this move for after I retreat he wins material and my monarch is badly exposed which will allow his attacking pieces to swarm right in.
980,33,9,1Bf4,b'r6r/pp1nkp1p/2qN1np1/2p5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Continuing with his development.  But I'm also pretty sure that he's taking advantage of my exposed King.  I'm just not sure how.
981,33,10,1Nxe4,b'r6r/pp1nkp1p/2qN2p1/2p5/4nB2/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? At first I thought I was safe which was the reason behind this move.  This however was a time where I did not think it through due to overlooking his next move.  What happened was perceptual illusion because I forgot about his Nd6.  Now that I think of it this is similar to my second game against Tim because this blunder occured a day or two prior to me postponing my games.  Like that game I was terribly distracted due to planning ahead for the vacation.  In this case I was thinking about how to prevent fatigue while on the plan in order to study a Susan Polgar as opposed to focusing on the game.  This is the second game that resulted in a costly error and prevent me from doing my Homework.  In doing so any chances of saving the game are now over.  In fact this position is resignable but my reason for staying in is to follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk rules which states that we don't resign until mate can be forced.
982,33,11,Rhc8,b'r1r5/pp1nkp1p/2q3p1/2p5/4NB2/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Knowing that it can't get worse I follow one rule of thumb.  That it's generally a good idea to have the Rook behind the Queen.  You'll note that things were crazy and this move happened very shortly after coming back from vacation.
983,33,12,1Bd6+,b'r1r5/pp1nkp1p/2qB2p1/2p5/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Taking advantage of my weakened King as noted earlier.
984,33,13,1Ng5,b'r1rk4/pp1n1p1p/2qB2p1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Preparing for a mating net.  So I'll do what I can to hold it off.  How I figured out that it's lost is me being in worse trouble then one could imagine.  He will prepare his Queen and one of his Rooks.  When this happens mate will soon to be followed because there's the Knight and the DSB.  As I know when two or more attacking pieces work together it often spells disaster and this is no exception.  
985,33,14,1Nf6,b'r1rk4/pp3p1p/2qB1np1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Trying to confuse him which I no doesn't work.  But the strategy is the same as what redfoxrising used against me without luck.  So all I can do is hope that he goes wrong which would enable counterplay.  My chances are zero but the idea is seeing how long you last which is part of why the WTW rules are not resigning until you see a forced mate.
986,33,15,1Qe2,b'r1rk4/pp3p1p/2qB1np1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',The move that I anticipated.
987,33,16,1Qd7,b'r1rk4/pp1q1p1p/3B1np1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I try to block the mate.
988,33,17,1Rad1,b'r1rk4/pp1q1p1p/3B1np1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',But as I know he had ways to prevent.  In other words I knew that he would play because of what's soon to follow.
989,33,18,1Qe8,b'r1rkq3/pp3p1p/3B1np1/2p3N1/8/8/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',This was in my game notes since that's part of my Homework which didn't start until recently.  But I got ideas from bhidragon and kenneth_fiore_3 since moves had to be discussed before playing them.  And I also remember being given Homework so this dates back as it's based on what went through my mind (the thought process) before each move was played.  What I have is This was very difficult for me to access. But if I take the bishop he gets a pawn and my Queen for Knight after 18.Nxf7 But if I don't do something he mates with 18.Qe7# Therefore 17...Qd7 is forced. If I don't move my Queen it gets pinned. But if I go anywherelse aside from e8 he mates with 19.Qe2#. So my only option is 18...Qe8.
990,33,19,Nd7,b'r1rkq3/pp1n1p1p/6p1/2p3N1/8/6B1/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Forced and now the Knight is tied down.  If this weren't the only move I would've gotten out with the monarch because a pin like this is very serious.  But there's nothing I can do about it.  And as we know he'll force mate starting with the next move.
991,33,20,2Rfe1,b'r1rkq3/pp1n1p1p/6p1/2p3N1/8/6B1/PPP1QPPP/3RR1K1 b - -',At first I thought that this was played to protect his Queen but there's more to the story then meets the eye.  That's because as the story reveals he'll force mate.  In fact the reason for my next move isn't just for exchanging Queens.  But having said that I would've captured on e2 anyhow.  However the idea was to if possible prevent mate since the immediate threat was 21.Qxe8#.
992,33,21,2Rxe2,b'r1rk4/pp1n1p1p/6p1/2p3N1/8/6B1/PPP1RPPP/3R2K1 b - -',But it cannot.  I analyzed the board and asked myself what could be done to prevent.  The answers is nothing because of 22.Nxf7+ Kc8 (forced) 23.Re8# which is mate.  So I resigned here.  What's important is to see how the game is developing and what must be done.  This is another example of where I overlooked his attacking forces against my monarch and paid the ultimate price.  This wouldn't have happened if I had castled with 10...0-0-0 as he would not have had any forces to attack my monarch as quickly.  So the real moral as it were in my game with bhidragon is to figure out the entire story that the board is revealing which is still a weakness for me.  And that's why I feel that getting out of my comfort zone is vital to becoming a better player.
993,34,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.  
994,34,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',developing the knight and preparing for the exchange on d4.

996,34,3,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Establishes a forward position for the knight and creating exchange threats on f3 and e2 if it is beneficial for black at some point. The strategic idea is to create a long term structural pawn weakness that can be exploited later on
997,34,4,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',utility move that threatens b7-b5 at some point while limiting the influence of the LSB and white knight. 
998,34,5,b3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',a great move that opens up all kinds of deadly possibilities along the dark diagonal. So much so black is kinda forced to develop his DSB to a less than ideal spot. 
999,34,6,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',with the up coming Bb2 e5 will be come a hot spot on the board so I play Bd6 to get some control and protection on it. Part of being a higher class player is being able to accurately predict what your opponent plans to do in the future and do something about it before it becomes a problem. Most chess players only respond to current threats not latent threats.  
1000,34,7,Ne7,b'r1bqk2r/1p1pnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The knight is going to g6 where it can help in the fight for control of e5.

White plans to exchange the strong black knight for his weaker one. While at the same time creating a weak pawn on d4 that is easy to attack. 
1002,34,9,Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Developing and anticipating to meet the knight exchange by playing Bxh2 creating a weakness of my own.

1007,34,14,1Qh5,b'r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp1n1/7Q/3NP3/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K b kq -',at first glance it looks like white will loss tempo against ...Nf4 but white can play for the exchange of queens and deny black the ability to castle. All of this is enough compensation for the threat of ....Nf4. However black does get to create a further pawn structure weakness on d3. Which could prove difficult to defend if we end up in a rook+bishop endings. 
1008,34,15,1Qg5,b'r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp3/6Q1/3NPn2/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K b kq -',next few moves are forced. 
1009,34,16,1Nc2,b'r1bk3r/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/8/4P3/1P1P4/PBNP1PP1/R4R1K b - -',threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
1010,34,17,1f6,b'r1bk3r/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4P3/1P1P4/PBNP1PP1/R4R1K w - -',defending b7 and limiting the influence of the white bishop. You always want to make sure that you have a firm control in the centre. Game are won and lost when players give up to much control in the center. 
1011,34,18,1f4,b'r1bk3r/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4PP2/1P1P4/PBNP2P1/R4R1K b - f3',excellent move that really puts pressure on e5 that will be very hard to resist
1012,34,19,1Rf8,b'r1bk1r2/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4PP2/1P1P4/PBNP2P1/R4R1K w - -',I plan to deflect that battle away from e5 and on to f6 where I am stronger. Placing the rook on f8 supporting f6 and deflecting my bishop to e7 will ensure I have equality.

1016,34,23,dxe6,b'r1bk1r2/1p4pp/4pb2/p7/8/1P1P4/PBNP2P1/R4R1K w - -',essentially equal here as both sides have major structural weaknesses 
1017,34,24,2Ne3,b'r2k1r2/1p1b2pp/4pb2/p7/8/1P1PN3/PB1P2P1/2R2R1K b - -',nice move white threatens Nc4 with a nice position
1018,34,25,2b5,b'r2k1r2/3b2pp/4pb2/pp6/8/1P1PN3/PB1P2P1/2R2R1K w - b6',forced but the black pawns on the queen side have potential to rip things wide open. Also to black's advantage is the pawn majority on the king side in the event that this becomes a two way horse race. 
1019,34,26,2Kg1,b'r2k1r2/3b2pp/4pb2/pp6/8/1P1PN3/PB1P2P1/2R2RK1 b - -',smart idea to get the king closer to the center
1020,34,27,2a4,b'r2k1r2/3b2pp/4pb2/1p6/p7/1P1PN3/PB1P2P1/2R2RK1 w - -',kind of a strange move but this really complicates the position for white. White has no less than three options here all of which at first glance look equal but only one has promise for a draw. 
1021,34,28,2Bc3,b'r2k1r2/3b2pp/4pb2/1p6/p7/1PBPN3/P2P2P1/2R2RK1 b - -',first real inaccuracy though not a real game changer. For one it hinders the rook and add no real value to white. I wonder if Oddlord looked at 26. Ng4!? leading to further exchanges. Of course also worth looking at for white is stopping the queen pawn storm for good with 26. b4 when shifting everything to the king side and playing for a draw is inevitable.  
1022,34,29,2h5,b'r2k1r2/3b2p1/4pb2/1p5p/p7/1PBPN3/P2P2P1/2R2RK1 w - h6',denying white's main counterplay of Ng4 and gaining space on the kingside. 
1023,34,30,2Bxf6+,b'r2k1r2/3b2p1/4pB2/1p5p/p7/1P1PN3/P2P2P1/2R2RK1 b - -',?! another small but important inaccuracy. I guess idea is to exchange and simplify but this give black two strong and mobile pawn chains.  I would have played 27. Bb4 rf7 28. d5 heading for d5 to liquidate an important strategic weakness 
1024,34,31,2b4,b'r2k4/3b2p1/4pr2/1p5p/pP6/3PN3/P2P2P1/2R2RK1 b - -',The idea is to stop the queen side pawn storm but black has a dagger up his sleave. Best to me is 28. Rxf6 gxf6 29. Then b4
1025,34,32,2Rxf1+,b'r2k4/3b2p1/4p3/1p5p/pP6/3PN3/P2P2P1/2R2rK1 w - -',!! Black seizes the initiative and with all of white's pieces on the back rank black may have time to convert his space advantage into a winning one
1026,34,33,e5,b'r2k4/3b2p1/8/1p2p2p/pP6/3P4/P2P2P1/2R2NK1 w - -',actives the bishop and ensures that d3 remains a long term weakness. 
1027,34,34,3a3,b'r2k4/3b2p1/8/1p2p2p/pP6/P2P4/3P2P1/2R2NK1 b - -',white looks ok by sealing the door on the queen side. However if I can steer this game into a king+pawn ending I have strong wining chances. So I seek to exchange pieces then race to the center with my king. 
1028,34,35,3Rxc8+,b'2Rk4/3b2p1/8/1p2p2p/pP6/P2P4/3P2P1/5NK1 b - -',?? the final nail in the coffin as exchanges benefit black not white. Also with black having retained his LSB the d3-pawn becomes near impossible to defend with a knight. I think the last chance for a draw is Rc3 but even after that white has to play precise chess. 
1029,34,36,Ke7,b'2b5/4k1p1/8/1p2p2p/pP6/P2P4/3P1KP1/5N2 w - -',racing to the centre
1030,34,37,3Ng3,b'2b5/4k1p1/8/1p2p2p/pP6/P2P2N1/3P1KP1/8 b - -',This move does two things. First it attacks the h5 pawn and allows the knight to go to e4 where it hopes to stop any advances of the king side pawns. 
1031,34,38,3h4,b'2b5/4k1p1/8/1p2p3/pP5p/P2P2N1/3P1KP1/8 w - -',forcing the knight to e4 where I plan to trade it off for a easily won king+pawn ending. But strategically it prevents the knight from aiding in the king side defence

1039,34,46,h3,b'8/8/7k/1p1KP3/pP4p1/P6p/6P1/8 w - -',White finally waved the flag here but not without a super effort. 
1040,35,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So it starts off with the Guaco Piano.  That's because as per reversions advice in the tourney to try different things.  Now I've played the Ruy Lopez many times and it's what I'm most used to.  But this is the second or third time that I've played the Guaco Piano.
1041,35,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I was wondering how he's answer but once he played the Berlin Defense I decided to do some of the other WTW games involving this mini tourney.

I assume based on what happened in my game against nuntar that he won't know what to do.  That's because it's so unusual to have 4.Nc3 played.  The most common continuation is 4.0-0 followed by 5.Re1  But similarly to my first game against elyhim I want to take lacinko out of his comfort zone in order to give him more to think about.  However he does to his next move.  So this wasn't the best choice as now after 4...Bc5 I won't be able to answer with 5.c3 which as reversion told me is the most common response.  The plan with 5.c3 is that white can then play 6.d4 and this is where the pawn chain becomes a liability as he told me in our training game.
1043,35,3,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Since I can't push c2-c3 I for the alternative which is castling.

But in this position I don't know if it really matters.  That's because I'm thinking about what cplusplus11 said about pawn structures and where they apply.  And that's a weakness I have is knowing the positions in which they become important this early.
1045,35,5,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',So I attempt to go back to mainlines by centralizing my Rook since Re1 is often played.
1046,35,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Meanwhile he castles.

I ask myself what it's capable of doing and apply what apply what tactical-abyss mentioned about Knight Visualization counts.  But unlike a previous game against Jack Stockel it applies here that there are just 4 squares to worry about.  And on those squares this N would not have been concerned.  Instead my N which he'll take was worth more so this was not the best move.  The plan works but it just isn't a good plan.  That's because this is a time where I shouldn't have exchanged just for the thrills of it (being that I was previously taught to exchange often against stronger players.)  The real motif behind this was to attack his Nc6 for tempo gain.  The problem is that my LSB will be semi blocked by my pawn and I wind up with doubled pawns in the center which is not good in this position.  Normally it would be ok this early except that I'm against a much more experienced player and therefore need to play more accurately.
1048,35,8,Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/2bPp3/2BN4/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',But I figured that I compensated here for once lacinko takes back because I anticipated his next move but felt that it would block his center due to his e5.  I didn't count on the fact that it doesn't and when he does recapture I'm already at a disadvantage due to the lack of center control from white.
1049,35,9,1c3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2Bb4/2P5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',? This is where I start to go wrong.  Come to think of it the idea behind this move was the same as what we saw with Jack Stockel.  It was to kick his Bishop for tempo gain.  And I wish this game happened after the loss against Jack as I wouldn't have thought this way.  It happened before being given advice from archduke_piccolo and cplusplus11.  The problem here is that his Bd4 is in the center which is where we want it to be.  By playing this it gets out of the center and then my monarch winds up exposed.  Best was 10.Qf3 as now I have added protection to my Kg1 which is directly under attack with his forces.
1050,35,10,1Kxf2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2B5/2P5/PP1P1KPP/R1BQR3 b - -',And the reason for giving me a piece for pawn is due to the monarch being exposed which puts me in rough shape especially with what will happen on the next move.  In fact this isn't a real gambit because he gets back a piece and I'm at a big disadvantage with what was noted.
1051,35,11,1Kg1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2B4q/2P5/PP1P2PP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',I considered 12.g3 but trying to last as long as possible at this point I didn't want to lose a pawn.  So this prevents him from playing 12...Qxh2+.  But there's something much bigger then this move which is my Bc8 which puts me down a pawn anyhow.  In other words I can't prevent the loss of a pawn.

That's because I almost overlooked what would've happened had I played 18.hxg4 which was something cplusplus11 mentioned in reachforgoals annotation about playing through those variations.  And it is not only critical to prevent blunder because I recently discovered that it's also part of thinking steps ahead.  But if I taken I had to think about what happens after 18...f2+ as I was thinking along the lines of 19.Kxf2  The problem is that it's not possible due to being an illegal move.  This is due to his Rf8 which means that 19.Kh2 is needed to prevent mate but he promotes and win's a Rook without compensation anyhow with 19...fxe1=Q which would be enough to resign.  And the real idea is how to save the position which I'm not ignoring but am still in some trouble because despite not being a passer his f3 is dangerous.  As I've learned you don't need a passer for a pawn to be dangerous.  Back in the day I only thought they were dangerous if we were talking about a passed pawn but pawns like this can also be very problematic."

1063,35,23,1Kh2,b'r4rk1/ppp3pp/3p4/3Pp3/8/2P2b1P/PP1P3K/R1B1R3 b - -',? Now I follow a tactic that I learned about from GM Susan Polgar about endgames which I also learned in some of those complicated mates that we know about.  The idea is triangulation and moving the monarch in a triangle since this is an endgame.  The idea is here and then on g3.  So traveling from g1-g3 is part of the triangulation method and you generally associate with trigonometry which comes to mind since the position is complicated for white.  However this is a mistake as I'm about to lose another pawn.  Much better was 19.c4.
1064,35,24,2b3,b'r4rk1/ppp3pp/3p4/3bp3/8/1PP4P/P2P3K/R1B1R3 b - -',?? And this is where I decide to fianchetto my Bc1.  But I missed the overall picture as now he has a mating sequence against me.  I didn't know that until the 21st move but the game is now lost for white. 20.Re2 was the only way to save this position and if he answered with 20...Bf3 I'd respond with 21.Rf8 with the idea being to exchange his more active Rf8 for my less active Re1.
1065,35,25,2Kg3,b'r5k1/ppp3pp/3p4/3bp3/8/1PP3KP/P2P1r2/R1B1R3 b - -',I figured however that I'd gotten out of trouble here because it appeared that 20...Rf2+ was a nuicanse.  This is where I learned that it's serious and leads to mate.  
1066,35,26,Bf3+,b'r5k1/ppp4p/3p4/4p1pK/8/1PP2b1P/P2P2r1/R1B1R3 w - -',And I resigned here because it's mate in two.  For one thing my only options are 24.Kh4 or 24.Kh6.  After that black answers with 24...Rf8 and now my monarch is pinned so that it can't get out danger which means that he'll use his Ra8 to mate on h4 or h6.

1119,38,3,Rd6,b'8/4b1p1/1p1rPkp1/1P5p/4RN1P/5P2/5PK1/8 w - -',Blacks almost in trouble but white has no killer blow. The black rook has to stay on the d file to prevent the knight check at d5.
