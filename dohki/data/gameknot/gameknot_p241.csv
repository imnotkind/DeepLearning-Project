0,0,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"Hi everyone!  Yet another round against Freddy and yet another date with Old Matey.  How did this happen well to summarise I start of with c4 which is the English Opening which controls the squares b5 and d5 and also allows for Nc3 without blocking in the c pawn.  Freddy then surprises me with b5 - a gambit.  I decide to accept the gambit well you never know if I can hang on to the gambit material and he doesn't get any play for it then despite the near 500 rating difference I may be able to get an endgame victory.  But there is the saying ""Many a slip twixt cup and lip"" and boy doese'nt it happen here!  Freddy mixes things up in the database and I end up developing Fou Lenoir on the wrong square d2 instead of b2.  This made one heck of a difference as I was unable to control the c column and so had to concede that to Freddy.  Freddy then won back the pawn and weakened my kingside pawn structure.  If only I could swap off the heavies.  Freddy only had pawns on the kingside and I had a remote passer - with opposite bishops that would most probably have meant two words ........ draw game ........ but the heavies stayed on.  Ironically the most active piece was wait for it ............GLENDA!!  Unfortunately she strayed from Henry's side to try to aid promotion of my remote a pawn - unfortunately allowing for a decisive and fatal invasion of the Wicked Witch of the West and that is when Henry met an ignominious end.  Anyhow on with the game."
1,0,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/5n2/1P6/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nc3 - after the b pawn is gambited there are two normal developing knight moves on both sides one to c3 and the other f6.
2,0,2,Nxb5,b'rn1qkb1r/1bpppppp/5n2/1N6/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',6. Nxb5 - seems to consolidate white's pawn advantage doubleton removed and I have an outside passed a pawn.
3,0,3,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1bppbppp/4pn2/1N6/3P4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',9.0-0 - so far so natural.  Normal routine development on both sides and I think I have equality here.   However it is 2 moves down the line that it starts to go mouldy on me.
4,0,4,1Bd2,b'rq3rk1/1bppbppp/n3pn2/1N6/3P4/P3PN2/1P1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',11. Bd2?! - would b3 have been a better try here?
5,0,5,1Nc3,b'rq3rk1/1bppbppp/n3pn2/8/3P4/P1N1PN1P/1P1BBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',13. Nc3? - on second thoughts I wonder if it was this move which was the lemon.  Would Rc1 have been a better plan here?  At least I would have bagged the c column first.
6,0,6,1Nxe4,b'rqr3k1/1b1pbppp/4pn2/8/1P2N3/P2BPN1P/3B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',17. Nxe4 - I would have loved to have backed up the knight with Rc1 but the a pawn would have been left hanging and the b pawn would have been left weak.
7,0,7,1a4,b'rqr3k1/1b1pbppp/4p3/8/PP2n3/3BPN1P/3B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',18. a4 - this pawn move releases the rook from the defense of the a5 pawn now it is defended by ........ guess who ........ well who else ......... Glenda!  Always on that back rank defending pawns.  Right now she would just lurve to be on g7 but she would need to be teleported there!
8,0,8,2Rb1,b'rqr3k1/3p1ppp/4p3/8/P7/2bBPP1P/5P2/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',22. Rb1 - after a plethora of exchanges Freddy has regained his pawn and busted up my kingside pawn structure.  I try to defend my valuable a4 passer by attacking the witch and then placing Fou Leblanc onto b5 next move.
9,0,9,2Qd3,b'r1r3k1/q4ppp/4p3/1B1p4/P7/2bQPP1P/5P2/1R3RK1 b - -',24. Qd3 - Glenda moves but I think that over the next 4 moves I had the opportunity to put a rook on c1 to neutralise the power of Freddy's rook on the c column.  I could have then moved Henry to h2 and then used my other rook to try and help Glenda attack the enemy king.  But silly me did not do this and I paid the price.  Do you the jury agree?
10,0,10,2h4,b'r1r3k1/5p2/4pqpp/1B1p4/P4PQP/2b1P3/5P2/1R3RK1 b - -',28. h4? - a well intentioned move this move is intended to try and open the g column and then place a rook on the g file and then Glenda and the rook neatly line up on the enemy king.  But there is the little matter of the Wicked Witch of the West.
11,0,11,2Qg5,b'r1r3k1/5p2/4pqp1/1B1p2Qp/P4P1P/2b1P3/5P2/1R3RK1 b - -',29. Qg5 - offering a queen trade but Freddy's next move puts the blockers on that.  The h4 pawn will fall.  In hindsight it would have been better to have let it go - at least I would have avoided getting Freddied later on.

18,0,18,Rxf2+,b'2r3k1/1Q3p2/4p1p1/1B1p3p/P4P1P/4Pq2/1b3r1R/4RK2 w - -',37. .......... Rxf2 !!!  Here Freddy announced mate in 11 beginning with:- 38. Rxf2 Qh1  39. Ke2 Rc2  40. Kd1 Rc1  41.

Like a good little girl I start to play out the moves.  Freddy sets them up as conditionals.  I play out the moves because I will have a hands on tuition on how to conduct a king hunt to the death.  I am very inexperienced at this sort of thing.  I have mounted a few successful mating attacks on lower rated players but with Freddy announcing #11 this all seems so crude and amateurish compared to this awesome thing that Freddy is about to show me.  I suppose the first step to being able to mount a successful mating attack is to be on the receiving end of one!

Kd2 - now here is a fingerslip - I should have played Ke2 but this turns out to be a happy fingerslip because although I still cop Old Matey I choose the quickest and least painful route.  For after the game I was able to access my personal db call up this game and analyse what would have happened had I continue to play along with Freddy.  The answer - I would have lost all yes all of my pieces bar Henry.  The bishop checkmate at the end would have been very pretty but I would have hated to give up all my pieces first so at least I was spared that.

Luckily I managed to force a queen trade later on which gradually turned the tide in my favour.  Finally we ended up in a K & P ending where even though I was a pawn up I had to avoid one last trick from Bob - I pull out a hidden talent from my sleeve the joblock!  This finally forced Bob's resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.

In this game I played to the level of my OTB rating - 1200!  In fact from some 1200 players I have seen better!  So Jo time to get back to basics!  The game starts off with Ion playing d4 and me trying to set up some flank action with the Modern Defence which is the response g6.

Rf7 - the only way to avoid losing material outright is to block the check on d5 with the rook - although the rook is pinned the Witch cannot take the b pawn as in moving the witch would release the rook from the pin and so the witch would be no more.  No such luck!

Rxd5 - I play the move but then decided to throw in the sponge because Glenda will fall next move and my rook will have to take on d1.  The recapture will leave Ion an R & P up.  I would resign against someone 300 points lower than me never mind higher with this kind of deficit.  A sorry tale.

I have now managed 4 points out of the first 5 games with 3 wins and 2 draws.  This is my latest win.  We start off with a standard Ruy Lopez leading to a variation called the Leonhardt Variation.

143,8,7,Rde8,b'4r3/5pbk/p5pp/npB5/4r3/5N1P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',24. ......... Rde8 - hope you can all follow that frenetic action!  I decided to double rooks on the e file and keep up the pressure on b2.  Crucially my hind rook moves onto a white square so that black's dsb cannot fork it against my knight on the rim.
144,8,8,Rxe4,b'8/5pbk/p5pp/npB5/4r3/5N1P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - -',25. ......... Rxe4 - one pair of rooks is exchanged.

149,8,13,Kg7,b'8/3R1pk1/p5pp/1p6/8/r6P/5PP1/5K2 w - -',34. ...... Kg7 - maybe this move wastes a tempo but if I am unable to promote either b or a pawn and my rook is able to take one or more of his kingside pawns then I want to preserve my own kingside pawns!
150,8,14,Ra4,b'8/1R3pk1/p5pp/1p6/r7/7P/5PP1/5K2 w - -',10. ......... Ra4 - 1st step in a plan to gradually nurse one of the queenside pawns to Glendadom!
151,8,15,b4,b'8/1R3pk1/p5pp/8/rp4P1/7P/5P2/5K2 w - -',36. ........ b4 - but I do not have to think about this plan any more because my opponent decides enough is enough and he hands me 9.6 mega handy rating points!  What a good start to the weekend!  Joanne

Neither N has a sensible move.  My QB can't move and if I play my b-pawn the c-pawn falls.  In retrospect perhaps 11...Nh5 is better than the move played.

172,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game White is attacking on the kingside and Black prepares a counterattack in the center. However strategy gives way to tactics when White captures a poisoned pawn and traps his own queen. All comments are most welcome!
173,10,1,h3,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Of course White cannot take on e5 because of Qd4 when both his knight and pawn on e4 are hanging. This would mean losing the pawn as well as the right to castle.
174,10,2,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/2b1p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The pawn on e5 is still immune so Black continues developing.
175,10,3,f6,b'r1bqk1nr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now the pawn finally had to be protected. The move 6...f6 somehow weakens the diagonal a2-g8 but this is of no consequence: White's light-squared bishop is off the board and his queen is not in position to control that diagonal.
176,10,4,Ne7,b'r1bqk2r/1pp1n1pp/p1p2p2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black continues developing. It is not clear where the bishop should go so it is better to first develop the knight.
177,10,5,Nh2,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1n1pp/p1p2p2/2b1p3/4P3/2NP3P/PPP2PPN/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So it becomes clear that White is preparing a kingside attack. This move is made with the idea of making the move f4 possible.
178,10,6,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/p1p1bp2/2b1p3/4P3/2NP3P/PPP2PPN/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Since there are still no threats Black continues developing and tries to control the center. This will become important later on.

180,10,8,1Ng6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1p1bpn1/2b1p3/4P3/2NP3P/PPP2PPN/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Controlling f4 with the knight and freeing one more square for the queen. Black's knight was weak where it was and on g6 it controls more squares and also helps protect the kingside.

183,10,11,Nxf4,b'r4rk1/1ppq2pp/p1p1bp2/2b1p3/4Pn2/3P3P/PPP1N1PN/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Black takes with the knight in order to swap it off. Reducing White's material will help blunt his attack. Also less pieces means more scope for the two bishops that Black has at his disposal.
184,10,12,1Bxf4,b'r4rk1/1ppq2pp/p1p1bp2/2b1p3/4PB2/3P3P/PPP1N1PN/R2Q1R1K b - -',This decision is difficult to understand. White gives away his good bishop and in my opinion he should have captured with the knight to keep the bishop on board.
185,10,13,Bf7,b'r4rk1/1ppq1bpp/p1p2p2/2b5/4PN2/3P3P/PPP3PN/R2Q1R1K w - -',Simply moving the bishop to safety. This bishop does not have too many squares to move to but it does control some central squares and is a good defender of Black's king.
186,10,14,Bd6,b'r4rk1/1ppq1bpp/p1pb1p2/8/4PN2/3P1Q1P/PPP3PN/R4R1K w - -',And so Black starts preparing his counterplay. Since White is attacking on the kingside it is best to counter with an attack in the center. Combined with Black having doubled pawns on the c-file this suggests that Black should try to exchange his c6 pawn for White's c2 pawn by capturing on d3 when the recapturing backward pawn on d3 would be weak. Since White has no dark-squared bishop anymore the square in front of it would be weak as well. Therefore Black prepares the push c5 and also positions the bishop where it eyes the kingside as well.

189,10,17,1Qe3,b'r4r1k/1ppq1bpp/p2b1p2/2p5/4PNN1/3PQ2P/PPP3P1/R4R1K b - -',I have the impression that White does not have a clear plan of attack. It looks as if he is waiting for Black to make a mistake that will allow him to win the game...
190,10,18,1Rad8,b'3r1r1k/1ppq1bpp/p2b1p2/2p5/4PNN1/3PQ2P/PPP3P1/R4R1K w - -',...and meanwhile Black is following his plan of counterattacking in the centre. Playing c4 immediately would not be that good because White could simply play d4 and evade the capture. The two central pawns could then prove to be quite strong. So Black decides to first strengthen his grip on the d file. His plan is to play Be5 to make heavy pieces control the d file and only then to play c4.
191,10,19,Rfe8,b'3rr2k/1ppq1bpp/p2b1p2/2p1P3/5NN1/3PQ2P/PPP3P1/R4R1K w - -',This pin makes sure that the threatening pawn will disappear from the board.
192,10,20,2Qf3,b'3rr2k/1ppq1bpp/p2b1p2/2p1P3/5NN1/3P1Q1P/PPP3P1/R4R1K b - -',White silently attacks the b7 pawn.
193,10,21,2Bxe5,b'3rr2k/1ppq1bpp/p4p2/2p1b3/5NN1/3P1Q1P/PPP3P1/R4R1K w - -',Black sees the attack on the b7 pawn but decides that this is better than capturing with the pawn. After 20...f:e5 21.Ne2 Black must take care of his f7 bishop and this gives White time to blockade the weak e pawn when Black's dark-squared bishop is miserable as are his pieces on the d-file. And now if 20...N:e5 21.f:e5 Ne2 22.Bd5 saves the bishop and prevents the blockade attacking the queen at the same time and also screening b7 from attack. At this point I saw that 21.Q:b7 B:f4 22.R:f4 would make White's pieces not cooperate well and found this sufficient compensation for the pawn lost and so did not really expect White to take the b7 pawn.
194,10,22,2Qxb7,b'3rr2k/1Qpq1bpp/p4p2/2p1b3/5NN1/3P3P/PPP3P1/R4R1K b - -',And yet she did! Here I began to think how to exploit White's queen's poor position and noticed that it will be trapped. After 21...B:f4 22.R:f4 Bd5 White's queen has two squares: a6 and a7. After 23.Q:a6 Ra8 attacks the queen which has no place to go. And if 23.Qa7 then 23...Qd6 attacks the rook covers all queen's escape squares and at the same time threatens 24...Ra8 that will win the queen.
195,10,23,2Bxf4,b'3rr2k/1Qpq1bpp/p4p2/2p5/5bN1/3P3P/PPP3P1/R4R1K w - -',So I happily moved on with my combination.
196,10,24,2Rxf4,b'3rr2k/1Qpq1bpp/p4p2/2p5/5RN1/3P3P/PPP3P1/R6K b - -',Here I began to think about the planned move 22...Bd5 again and noticed the following possibility: 22...Bd5 23.Q:a6 Ra8 24.N:f6. This attacks my queen as well. If I play 24...g:f6 then 25.Q:f6  Qg7 (forced otherwise Black gets mated) 26.Raf1 and Black has a piece for three pawns but his pawn structure is shambles and White's pieces seem stronger. I couldn't believe that White's badly coordinated forces could be that effective and kept searching for something. And then I finally found that 24.N:f6 loses to 24...Q:h3 ! 25.Kg1 (the g-pawn cannot recapture because it is pinned by the bishop on d5) 25...Q:g2#.
197,10,25,2Bd5,b'3rr2k/1Qpq2pp/p4p2/2pb4/5RN1/3P3P/PPP3P1/R6K w - -',And so I did play 22...Bd5.
198,10,26,2Nxf6,b'r3r2k/2pq2pp/Q4N2/2pb4/5R2/3P3P/PPP3P1/R6K b - -',And here White makes the move that I thought destroys my combination but in the end found it does not. Moreover this just hastens White's defeat.
199,10,27,2Qxh3+,b'r3r2k/2p3pp/Q4N2/2pb4/5R2/3P3q/PPP3P1/R6K w - -',And now the king has to go to g1 and will be mated on g2. It's all over.

I wouldn't want him to take my knight on f6 and break up my pawn formation when he has a 4 to 3 advantage and open up my king to all of his pieces on the kingside. Which means I would have played 19. ... Nxd7 which would allow him to get a rook on the 7th rank and create problems for my queenside pawns. White didn't do it and now I prevent it with 19. ... Be6.

Ng5 which then trades knights and allows me to play Be2 to win the white bishop or which chases the knight away allowing Bc4 to win the white bishop - but I doubt white will allow this.

He linked his rooks defending the en prise rook on f1 and at the same time threatens to win the exchange by capturing Black's rook on f8.

It's important here that both the bishop and the queen remain on defensive duty to save the f6 pawn and the subsequent mate threats.

But black has a combination that cracks White's defense open like an egg.

The benefit of doing so is the power exercised by the Bishop along the diagonals a2-g8 and/or b1-h7.  This is seen in this game.  By attacking the B so quickly as in this game Black gets the opportunity to force a swap off by following up with 6... Na5.  Otherwise this move order tends to transpose to the main line.

As explained I was expecting 6...Na5 but Black sticks to opening principles avoiding moving a piece twice instead developing her QB on the long diagonal threatening not only to attack my B but also the e-pawn at the same time.

Re1 d5 for example.  Suetin also considers 7. d4 7. Nc3 and 7. Re1 which all look weak to me but White probably has hidden resources.

I seem to remember Spassky using that system against Fischer unsuccessfully.

If I cooperate with her plan I'll have a horribly cramped position so I'm already thinking about taking on g5.  I haven't yet decided whether to sac the N or the B for two pawns though.  Both plans had their attractions with the f-pawn undefended and attacked by my Bb3 and with the potential to make the pin on the black diagonal permanent.

White has a material advantage but double pawns. To me the game looks pretty even here. My queen is eying up the c3 pawn too which would equalise in material though I doubt white will allow that

Try to concentrate of moving one or both central pawns to the center (top of the hill) develop both knights and bishops and castle by move 10.  That takes 7 moves leaving 3 for defending or retreating if a piece was moved too far out."

As it is it hampers white a little and forces his rook to the e file but if white could get rid of the knight on e4 then the e1 is where white's rook should be to support his e pawn as it opens files for attacking.

It also links black's rooks which would be good if he planned on doing anything with them.  I think Bb7 or Rb6 would both be slightly better."

As pieces come off the board the king gets braver and braver.  With the closed position of the board and queens gone there's no reason that black's king needs to hide in the corner but protected pawns may be important later during the endgame."

Another option is Nxc1  followed by Ne2 which may lead to 18. Rxe2 Bxe2 19. Kxe2 winning a rook and bishop for bishop and knight but that gains less material as well as leaving white's active bishop in play."

He could either trade his d4 pawn if black pushed his c pawn and still maintain a pawn front on the d and e files or support his e pawn during a push forward.

At this point both positions are almost identical.  Black's rook on the b file is easily countered and the differences in pawn structure are almost negligible."
880,38,29,Rcd8,b'1r1r4/p1p2pkp/4pp2/3p4/P2PP3/3P1P2/5KPP/R3R3 w - -',Black should push his c pawn to exchange it since it's backwards (on a half open file and behind the adjacent pawn).  Backwards pawns can be difficult to defend and should be exchanged or pushed forward if possible.
