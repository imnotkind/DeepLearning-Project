Well, now that I have got my first ever Expert Victory out of the way I have another little gem for you against a near-Expert called myrydin (Tim).  Despite a queenless middlegame a player whose king is stuck in the centre is gonna cop a little trouble.  In order to find out whether it is King Henry or his Welsh counterpart King Myrydin that comes to grief you will just need to read on.  I begin with Nf3 which is the Reti Opening.  GA analysis is here: https://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=27211149&rnd=0.27808322082055636

GA confirms resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as I have a plus score of 6.48.  A fascinating example of how an uncastled king can be in danger even when the queens have been exchange and on Move 36!  I hope you have had a good read and another example of a king being caught in the centre will occur in my Jo against The Titans game against Coach Ion.  It is Henry but against a player of Expert/Master strength such as Ion, will it be a recipe for disaster?  Well, wait and see.  Till next time, bye for now - Joanne"

I first read about this in Nimzowitsch's book called My System. By taking control of b4 you're indirectly supporting the c5 square for a minor piece. White will then have to try and bolster the b4 square with moves like Rb1, if he's ever going to shift a Knight from c5. My plan here is simply to kill off any play that white may have on the queenside by re-routing my Queen's Knight to c5 and advancing the a-pawn to a4, if white allows this then I think black will be close to winning.

​I can understand Caruana's cautiousness before taking. He does not know if Carlsen has something up his sleeves or not. It does look scary with the Kingside attack, but a pawn is a pawn. It is NOT over as Black still has plenty of play left. Maybe too scary for Caruana to take?🤔

I did not like 24. g3 at all. It creates all sorts of problems for Caruana. It allows multiple threats such as f3 and Bh3. Black eventually can bring the Rook to f6 then h6. Too many problems! Too hard to fend off everything!
This is why I tried to explain and many fans simply refuse to believe. When players are in immense pressure, they start to see things that are not there. Nerves can play tricks in humans' minds. If Caruana is playing a 2000 player, he would not hesitate to capture on b5."

He is also playing against Caruana's team of seconds, Stockfish and Super Computers. From the time on the clock, it seems that Caruana is still in his element.
While Black is objectively OK here, in reality, Carlsen is in real pressure. He has no idea what else Caruana had cooked up at home. So he is trying to figure things out over the board knowing one mistake can cost him the World Championship title. Carlsen's struggle is real! One thing that really surprises me is why so many players insisting on repeating the same opening choice over & over again in World Championship matches. We saw how that worked out with Kasparov versus Kramnik as well as other matches. This plays into opponents' preparation advantage. Why not mix things up?"

I already read some online comments of how arrogant Carlsen is for playing 1...c5 for 4 games in a row. I am not sure if I would go that far, but it is questionable to allow your opponent to simply uncorking home preparation at will is either very brave or very crazy!
If Carlsen wins, people will say he is a genius for allowing this. If he loses, people will question his stubborness. What is your opinion?  "

This game 1 is very crucial to both players mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. A win by Caruana can give him wings to win this match. But a loss with white against Carlsen right at the start may be devastating. This is the battle ground game. The one who seize this first game will have a huge advantage!
This is a key crossroad! Does Caruana want to trade Queen or does he have the patience to be squeezed by Carlsen for another few hours? Very tough decision! "

10...Be7 used to be the most popular, while lately lots of games with 10...Re8. 
While 10...Rd8 is not a new move, according to my database Magnus never faced it before. That is why he is taking his time. 
The most common move here is 11. Nd2, played by Petrosian before in the 60's. If black plays 11...dxc4 then White has a comfortable position. 
However, if 11...d4 it can lead to interesting complications where Black sacrifices a piece. So this is why Carlsen is trying to decide how to proceed here.
Carlsen usually prefers quiet position advantage then squeeze while Caruana excels more in dynamic positions. So Carlsen must decide what type of game will he allow. This is all about match strategy, and sometimes Carlsen is known to play inferior moves just to shift the dynamic of the positions."

​What you are seeing is the behind the scene thinking of these players in a World Championship match. I remember this from my own match in 1996. A lot of guessing game and my team did a better job surprising my opponent. 
So when you see players sitting and thinking in what seems to be ""normal"" positions, what they are doing is try to figure out the potential landmines of home preparation. It is not like they are day dreaming or think about dinner 😅"

This has to change! @FIDE_chess needs to change this rule! No draw offer should be allowed! There is no draw offer in , ping pong , boxing , MMA & other sports. Fighting draw is no problem. But not because one’s nerves is shot! Am I wrong?  As I said in the beginning, the players will do what they think is best for them. They do not care about styles to please the fans. Carlsen came into this game wanting a draw. He offered to repeat early on. Caruana refused. Then he offered draw in better position + more time! ♟  Caruana would be crazy not to accept the draw offer in that position with such little time. Since Carlsen seems to have lost his ability to calculate deep lines, he is much more suited for FASTER time control where chess instinct is more important. That was the game plan.♟ Based on statistics, Carlsen is the favorite in faster time control.

He has to be extremely careful and it is now Carlsen's turn to strike back. The momentum has shifted after the promising opening surprise.
After 18...Ra8, Caruana is spending a lot of time. He now realizes that in spite of being temporarily up 2 pawns, he could be in trouble. The best move now is 19. Bc3 but then his Knight has no place to go. A big mess! So the cause is 17. c3 His pieces are in a tight space."

Now, if Carlsen finds 20...b5, he will block the b4 pawn, and in a few moves, he can take it after f6 defending the e5 pawn, then Bf8. Then white will have problems dealing with the passed b pawn and Black's Bishop pair. "

This is the key difference between Carlsen at his peak and the Carlsen now. He was so much more lethal then with this type of position.
I would really be interested to find out what went on in Carlsen's mind not to play 20...b5, eventually winning back the b4 pawn, and have a passed b pawn with a pair of Bishop supporting it! A real big miss for Carlsen here! 
Now Caruana will have time to consolidate and hold.

Then, I would have a Bishop to help stop Black's passed pawns, and a pawn majority on the K-side. It probably, might, have been enough to win. This way, it all goes awry.
