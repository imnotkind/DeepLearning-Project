The problem is that black needs a lot of tempo for launching an attack on the kingside"

My Class C opponent Manhattan (Janis) gave me a right run for my money in this game.  He seemed to have much the better of things in the middlegame and I fell into a combo which dropped me the exchange.  However I did manage to salvage two pawns for the exchange and after a queen trade I found myself with a decisive central pawn push which reduced my opponent's rook to extreme passivity.  One pawn did manage to reach Glendadom.  Although the WK could remove Glenda from the board he would have to lose his rook in the first place leaving me a piece and a pawn (a passer at that) to the good.  My opponent waved the white flag.

26,1,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',2. Bc4 - the Bishop's Opening.  This can transpose into a Vienna Game or the Guicco Piano.
27,1,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',3. ..... Nc6 - out come the knights.

29,1,4,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ -',8. ..... Re8 - bit stuck for a sensible plan here.
30,1,5,Bf8,b'r1bqrbk1/ppp2ppn/2np3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R1Q2RK1 w - -',10. ..... Bf8 - Due to the line up of white's dsb and the Wicked Witch of the West on h6 it has become a typical jstevens1 position - passivitis is setting in fast aaargh!
31,1,6,Be6,b'r2qrbk1/1pp2ppn/p1npb2p/3Np3/2B1P3/P2PBN1P/1PP2PP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - -',12. ...... Be6 - might as well continue to get my queenside developed.
32,1,7,1dxc4,b'r2qrbk1/1pp2ppn/p1np3p/4p3/2P1P3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',14. dxc4 - bishop trade.  I am really glad to have got rid of white's lsb.  That pin on f7 was becoming very annoying.
33,1,8,1cxd5,b'r2qrbk1/1pp2ppn/p2p3p/3Pp3/4P3/P3BN1P/1PP2PP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - -',16. cxd5 - a knight trade which gives my opponent a fairly big edge - I am still very cramped for style here.  I try to get out of the cramp by moving my knight to f6 and immediately put the pawn on e4 under the hammer.
34,1,9,Rac8,b'2r1rbk1/1ppq1pp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/2P1P3/P4N1P/1P1B1PP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - -',18. ...... Rac8 - still passive.

37,1,12,Rec8,b'2r2bk1/1prq1pp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/1P2P3/P4N1P/1Q1B1PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',22. ..... Rec8 - and I double on it.

I completely overlooked that and either my knight or my rook will fall.  I then realised that it would be best to dump the rook for that white dsb and get two pawns for the exchange.
42,1,17,Nxc5,b'2q2bk1/1p3pp1/p2p3p/2nPp3/8/P6P/5PPN/1Q2R1K1 w - -',28. .... Nxc5 - I am relieved to see the material count at the bottom of the board reading zero.  However is the two pawns for the exchange gonna be enough?!  Only time will tell.

45,1,20,dxc5,b'3q2k1/4bpp1/p6p/1ppPp3/8/P6P/5PP1/1QR3K1 w - -',33. .... dxc5 - this knight trade has opened up the c column to the WR.  On the plus side my c4 pawn is a passer.  On the minus side white's d5 pawn is also a passer.  Now which one is the strongest?
46,1,21,3Qe4,b'3q2k1/4bpp1/p6p/1ppPp3/4Q3/P6P/5PP1/2R3K1 b - -',34. Qe4 - nice to see my opponent resorting to defending his pawn with his queen.  That is usually my perogative!
47,1,22,3Bd6,b'3q2k1/5pp1/p2b3p/1ppPp3/4Q3/P6P/5PP1/2R3K1 w - -',34. ..... Bd6 - and just for once Glenda delegates this task to her ecclesiastical friend Fou Lenoir.  He defends both the e and c pawns in one go.  He may be overloaded but as he is a lower value piece than the WR it does not matter here.
48,1,23,c4,b'3q2k1/5pp1/p2b3p/1p1Pp3/2p1Q3/P5PP/5P2/2R3K1 w - -',35. ..... c4 - I now get some counterplay by pushing my c pawn to just 3 squares from Glendadom.
49,1,24,Qb6+,b'6k1/5pp1/pq1b3p/1p1Pp3/2p1QP2/P5PP/8/2R3K1 w - -',36. .... Qb6+ - I thought long and hard over this move.  I decided to eschew the pawn trade as I did not want the Wicked Witch and the WR to pile up on the f column and scare the bejezus out of Henry.
50,1,25,exd4,b'6k1/5pp1/p2b3p/1p1P4/2pp1P2/P5PP/6K1/2R5 w - -',38. ..... exd4 - now the queen trade has taken place just look at those black central pawns - awesome!
51,1,26,d3,b'6k1/5pp1/p2b3p/1p1P4/P1p2P2/3p2PP/6K1/2R5 w - -',39. .... d3 - even more awesome.
52,1,27,axb5,b'6k1/5pp1/3b3p/1p1P4/2p2P2/3p2PP/6K1/2R5 w - -',40. ..... axb5 - here I am being conservative yet again.  I just wanted to eliminate any chance of white getting a passer on the queenside which cannot easily be rounded up in time.  I now have 3 queenside passers.
53,1,28,4Rd1,b'6k1/5pp1/3b3p/1p1P4/2p2P2/5KPP/3p4/3R4 b - -',42. Rd1 - I think this is a big mistake as Ra1 would have prolonged the game and created complications for me.  This move loses spectacularly as follows.  I now see the finish line and set up conditional moves.
54,1,29,c2,b'6k1/5pp1/3b3p/1p1P4/5P2/6PP/2ppK3/3R4 w - -',43. .... c2 - white must now give up his rook.
55,1,30,cxd1=Q+,b'6k1/5pp1/3b3p/1p1P4/5P2/6PP/3K4/3q4 w - -',44. ..... cxd1/Q+ - just the sight of Glenda is enough to make some of my opponents topple their king Janis is no exception.  See that passer on b4 - that pawn will eventually reach Glendadom because if white had played on I would have put that pawn on b4 and then I would have brought Henry out into the open to hassle his kingside pawns.  The WK cannot be everywhere so I chalk up yet another handy win.  There is one more victory I will soon be annotating.  Anyhow - I hope you will all have a nice evening and enjoy your weekend - bye for now - Joanne

After a two week holiday in sunny Weymouth (including a day trip to Jersey) I have now returned back to Cambridge and Gameknotland.  Time to catch up on some annotating.

91,3,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bc4 - Here I decided on a novelty.  My usual moves here are either d4 or Bb5+ so Bc4 is a novelty to me.  It still develops a piece and Fou Leblanc cannot immediately be assailed from the a2-f7 diagonal which bears down on the BK while he is uncastled.
92,3,2,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',5. 0-0 - and Henry now tucks himself away on the kingside.

97,3,7,1Qxc5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/4pnp1/2Q1Nb2/8/1BPP4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',14. Qxc5 - that juicy p(r)awn on c5 was just too tempting for Glenda so she wastes no time in devouring it.  Please note that if black now plays BxP then Rd1 pins the bishop against the Wicked Witch of the West on d8.  The bishop will then be removed by my e5 knight on the next turn and black will be a whole piece down.  My opponent spots this however and decided to harass Glenda with b6.
98,3,8,Bxg4,b'r2q1rk1/p4pbp/1p2p1p1/8/6b1/1BPPQ3/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',16. ..... Bxg4 - knight trade.  I am very happy with this trade because I am a pawn up and trading pieces will increase my advantage in the endgame.
99,3,9,2Qxc2,b'r4rk1/p4pbp/1p1qp1p1/8/3P4/2P5/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',20. Qxc2 - and now a bishop trade which keeps the endgame principle going.
100,3,10,2Bd2,b'r4rk1/p5bp/1p1qp1p1/5p2/3P4/2P5/PPQB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',21. Bd2 - at last I complete my development on move 21.  The downside of pawn grabbing in the opening or early middle game means that you waste a tempo in getting your pieces out which can in some cases prove very costly to the grabber.  Thankfully it did not do this in this case.
101,3,11,Bxe5,b'r4rk1/p6p/1p1q2p1/4bp2/8/2P5/PPQB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',22. ..... Bxe5 - pawn trade and black threatens to win back a pawn with Bxh2+.  He can check Henry if he wants to but he ain't gonna have the pawn so he moves to h3.
102,3,12,2Rad1,b'3r1rk1/p6p/1p1q2p1/4bp2/8/2P4P/PPQB1PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',24. Rad1 - black piles up on Fou Lenoir but I decided to defend by centralising my QR.  This move threatens Bh6 winning the exchange as it discovers an attack on the Wicked Witch.
103,3,13,Rxd8,b'3r2k1/p6p/1p4p1/5p2/5q2/2P4P/PPQ2PP1/5RK1 w - -',26. ...... Rxd8 - rook trade.  Now I offer another one but black declines the trade.
104,3,14,2Qb3+,b'4r1k1/p6p/1p4p1/5p2/5q2/1QP4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',28. Qb3+ - aha just when it looks as though the BR and the Witch could do menacing things to Henry Glenda decides it's time the BK was made to feel the white heat.  Black moves his king to h8 nacht and now Glenda hops on her broomstick right into the enemy camp on f7 that's right f7.  Not quite so defensive eh!?
105,3,15,Rg8,b'6rk/p4Q1p/1p4p1/5p2/5q2/2P4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',29. ..... Rg8 - this naturally defensive move leads spectacularly to a back row mate.  A few moves back you would not think this at all possible would you with the black pawns in a chain from h7 to f5 but here it comes .....
106,3,16,3Qf6+,b'6rk/p6p/1p3Qp1/5p2/5q2/2P4P/PP3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',30. Qf6+ ..... wait for it ......

108,3,18,3Rd8#,b'3R3k/p5rp/1p3Qp1/5p2/5q2/2P4P/PP3PP1/6K1 b - -',31. Rd8 MATE!! - .... NOW!!!  So black has copped Old Matey giving me two handy rating points.  It is checkmate because the rook on g7 is pinned to the BK and cannot block the check on d8 and the king is tied to the black row and cannot escape.  This is just a taster of what is to come so keep watching this space ......

I considered developing Nbd2 to b3 with a strongly posted knight on d4.  This move opens up the Queen to access the light diagonal on the KS for hopes of a Qg4 if the bishop leaves its defense of g7

415,9,7,Nb3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2bpP3/8/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is questionable.  I do not think in retrospect that this knight belongs on b3 but it gains the tempo on black's valued dsb and forces the question of which diagonal it shall possess.  It stakes out control of d4 still
416,9,8,Qg4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/1b2p3/3pP3/6Q1/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',An aggressive move recommended by Dzindzichashvili in some of his interesting Bd2 lines against the Winnawer pin on the c3 knight in the advance French it makes sense to play this now that the bishop has committed itself away from the defense of the pawn and g6 is an awkward weakening of the dark squares on black's KS. 
417,9,9,Ne7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/1b2p3/3pP3/6Q1/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I saw the chance for the following: Qxg7 Rg8 Qxh7 Rxg2 Be3 Bxe3 fxe3 and the position is jumbled a bit with doubled e pawns for white but the outside passed h pawn.  White will castle QS and pursue KS initiative now that  it is opened.    White has good control on d4 but the position is unclear in my mind at least so it was otb.

I made it in the mindset of a quick attack though it really just gives tempi to black in his defense which gets hi pieces to agreeable squares and allows him the development lead

It allows and encourages Bd7 developing black's lsb naturally.  This is the second time this bishop has moved in the opening so for beginners this should be made a special note of how not to play the opening.  Better wa s Nbd2 with ideas of castling long and after h6 most likely Bxe7 to save the tempo as it would be awkward to retreat the bishop and on h5 the same response most likely as the one to h6 with some slight danger because of Bxf2+ not Kxf2 for then Qb6+ winning white's queen.  The threat by black's knight against e5 is temporarily blunted by the pin but this is a quick fix and soon white finds himself tied up by his own initiative.
421,9,13,1Bxc6,b'r2qk2r/pp1bnppp/1bB1p3/3pP1B1/6Q1/1N6/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',? Better was maybe Bxe7 Nxe7 Bxd7+ Qxd7 Qxg7 or Nbd2 and maybe even f4 in the immediate future.  This commits giving away the bishop pair for absolutely nothing (the way I play it which is a good note to the beginner as well don't give away the bishop pair note even for a pawn or even two pawns in an open position).

It has already been said this is my worst game of chess..   From there: Rh1 e1=Q+ Rxe1 Bxe1 Nbd4! (blocking the d pawn so that the knight on e6 can block the rook making Rg8 suggested which would then create b3 and Ng5 to folow with the idea of Ne7 to at least get some compensation)  Maybe white can make chances with his passed pawn although his back rank is still weak.

457,11,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black responds with e6 which I think is a little weaker than c6 based on my experience. 
458,11,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As opposed to the usual Nc3 I developed the other knight first. My general strategy for this game was to attack the king-side strongly ready to strike with force if black decides to castle short. 
459,11,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black brings his knight up adding defense on the attacked d5 square while eyeing the e4 as a possible resting spot.
460,11,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Advancing aggressively to the king-side with the bishop. Pinning pieces is always nice.

462,11,8,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I developed the other knight attacking the center.

Was black possibly thinking of Qa5 to attack queen-side and pin my knight? This move also blocks his knight from coming to c6 so it really is a rather defensive move. 
464,11,10,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3P2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I attack the center now just for the sake of being aggressive and opening the center I guess but I'm not really proud of this move. Black's last move made sure that he could establish a solid center structure by taking with the c-pawn. So basically I attacked his strong point allowing him to open up the queen-side. Does anyone have any thoughts on what you had played here and why? 
465,11,11,exd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I was surprised to see black didn't utilize his c-pawn here but instead took with the e-pawn giving me the advantage in central pawns. This move makes way for his bishop possibly coming to g4 getting ready to pin the knight or f5 to attack my queen-side.

Analyzing this game know I would say f4 would have probably been better since I don't have a particular reason to stay at this diagonal because the pin is broken. He also has a discovered attack against my bishop. On f4 the bishop would have later had the opportunity to take part attacking the king from the e5- or possibly d6-square. Any thoughts on this?

I guess I wasn't expecting black to bring up his king's pawns so early in the game and ignored the threat."

Black's knight on f6 is troublesome as it prevents my queen from coming to h5 or g4. What would you play here?
482,11,28,1h4,b'rn1q1rk1/1b2bp2/2p2n2/p2pN1p1/1p1P3P/3BP1N1/PP3PP1/2RQK2R b K h3',15.h4 bingo! Attacks g5 looking to open h-file for my rook. At this point I analyzed the position quite a bit looking for possible checking patterns.

Despite the doubled c-pawns it's no doubt that White has a winning edge amongst true GMs IMs and Masters. White needs to be the one to press lines here and take advantage of their open lines.
633,17,6,1Nd5,b'r2qr1k1/pppb1ppp/2np4/3N4/2P1n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White's knight has found a good post on d5 while Black catches up on development. The white DSB is poised to control the long diagonal now that black will have a harder time contesting it.  
634,17,7,1Ne7,b'r2qr1k1/pppbnppp/3p4/3N4/2P1n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',We're down to two games left in the GK database. Black doesn't want to leave the strong knight on d5 while White is ok to trade it since it will fix his pawn structure. That being said the pawn will not be well supported as it is a bit extended. 
635,17,8,1f3,b'r2qr1k1/pppbnppp/3p4/3N4/2P1n3/5P2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This still follows the GK database with a win for White. The other option 12. Bf3 lead to a draw. I did  consider that move and probably should have played it this move is a bit more aggressive but opening the structure around the king is certainly problematic. 
636,17,9,Qh4,b'r3r1k1/pppb1ppp/3p4/2nP4/7q/5P2/PPPBB1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The first novelty of the game. I took my time here and tried to really understand the position. The game we had been following so far continued with 14... Qf6 15. Bc3. The text move gives the queen some more mobility but I figured the main threat was still on d4 so continued the same.
637,17,10,Na4,b'r3r1k1/pppb1ppp/3p4/3P4/n6q/2B2P2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',However this allows the strong move by black which will rob White of one their key advantages the DSB. GK engine recommends the very computer-like 15. Rf2 Re7 16. Ba5 but playing 15. Ba5 immediately also seems fine that being said going back to move 15 it's still hard for me to find a good move or plan Ba5 was never a move that I even considered. 
638,17,11,1g3,b'r3r1k1/pppb1ppp/3p4/3P4/n6q/2B2PP1/PPP1B2P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Given how this game continued I would have much preferred the recommended 16. Re1 but I was thinking at the time that I would be able to get the queens off the board early and perhaps hold on longer. I even toyed with 16. g3 Nc3 17. gh4 Nd1 18. Bd1 but then even I could see the cracks or shall we say grand canyon gaps in White's position. 
639,17,12,1Bd3,b'r3r1k1/pppb1ppp/3p4/3P4/q7/2PB1PP1/P1P4P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I want to contest the e-file but was probably better to position the rook first.

White doesn't want to retreat as he will then lose his bishop for two pawns without much hope of attack because of lack of development on the KS.

Now it blocks the access of the king's rook optimally it should be placed on the half open c file and white should strive to push his a and b pawns to try to force a weakness in the black pawn chain.  This increases tension in the pin.
667,19,13,Bd7,b'r3r1k1/pp1b2p1/2p4p/q2p1p2/1b1Pn3/4P1P1/PPQN1PBP/1N2RRK1 w - -',Black has clearly shifted focus from the KS with his early knight maneauver to chances on the QS as this move activates the queen's rook and guards the c pawn so that there may be advances on the QS.  Black doesn't want to give white counter chances by ignoring his development on the QS.  Simplifying with the exchange in order to grab the a pawn is also a bad idea as white gets more than enough in positional factors.
668,19,14,1e4,b'r3r1k1/pp1b2p1/2pb1n1p/q2p1p2/3PP3/P4PP1/1PQN2BP/1N2RRK1 b - -',Here white has successfully parried black's attack and returend by grabbing tempi and space ultimately coming to contest e4 with lots of pressure.

Black has been pushed back a bit and his queen perhaps is a little awkward though so too is white's knight.  I would assess this as about equal because of the bishop pair and the fact that both open files can still be contested easily.

I had a little under 5 minutes left on my clock here.  A back and forth kind of game hope it was somewhat interesting.  Please comment if I missed something I only spent about an hour or so on this so I'd appreciate the help.  Thanks!
693,20,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game is interesting as I won a pawn and tried to hang on to it. I think I went wrong soon after and lost the exchange and from then on I had a lost position. After the game my opponent said that I was wrong to try to hang on to the extra pawn but I suspect it is not really that bad. I would very much appreciate your views dear reader!
694,20,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So he replies in kind
695,20,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I continue with the Queen's Gambit
696,20,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',and he declines it in the most popular way.
697,20,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I continue with the usual.
698,20,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',"and he continues with the Tarrasch Defence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrasch_Defense ""With his third move Black makes an aggressive bid for central space. After White plays cxd5 and dxc5 Black will be left with an isolated pawn on d5. Such a pawn may be weak since it can no longer be defended by other pawns; but it grants Black a foothold in the center and Black's bishops will have unobstructed lines for development."""
699,20,6,cxd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I play the recommended. 
700,20,7,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',As well as this recapture Black has the interesting Hennig-Schara gambit. 4. cxd5 cxd4 5. Qxd4 Nc6 6. Qd1 exd5 7. Qxd5 Bd7 is one line. White should be ok but I was slightly worried that he would play this and know it better than me!
701,20,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So I continue with the usual development.
702,20,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And so does he.
703,20,10,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is all main line. White intends on exchanging on c5 and having the Bg2 bearing down on the isolated d pawn on d5.

The Swedish Variation has ECO code D33."
705,20,12,Bg2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',and White carries on with developing.
706,20,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',As does black.
707,20,14,dxc5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I thought it was time to take on c5 as he has moved his bishop from f8. In a similar black playing the standard defence to the Queens Gambit declines waits before white moves his Bf1 before exchanging on c4. I also prevent a transposition to the Swedish variation. I was interested to see that in fact both 0-0 and Bg5 are more popular at this point.
708,20,15,Bxc5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So he recaptures.
709,20,16,Bg5,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp2B1/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I decided to increase the pressure on the d5 pawn.

713,20,20,1Nxf6+,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2N2/6B1/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I take
714,20,21,1Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2b2/6B1/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',He takes back
715,20,22,1Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2B2/8/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I take again
716,20,23,1Qxf6,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',He takes back again
717,20,24,1Qd2,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I cover the black squares with my queen.
718,20,25,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/R3K2R w KQ -',He castles
719,20,26,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',So did I
720,20,27,1Bg4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p2b1/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',and this is the logical square to develop his bishop. Now this position has been seen before. I found out later that the Gameknot game chessterkh67 (1802) vs. jraul (1706) continued with 15. Rac1 and white won in 34. According to the Gameknot opening databases h6 has been played 6 times with 3 white wins 3 black wins Rfd1 has been played with 1 white win one black win and 15. Rac1 led to a win for black in Ancival Lucien (2068) vs. Guillaumat Jean… (2057). I find another move. See if you can find what I played?
721,20,28,1b4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/1P1p2b1/5NP1/P2QPPBP/R4RK1 b - b3',This seemed logical to me. Boot the knight from c6 by continuing with b5 and then take on d4. What do you think of this move dear reader? Is this where I first went wrong?
722,20,29,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/1P1p2b1/5NP1/P2QPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',so he delevops his Rf8 to a logical square.
723,20,30,1b5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/1P6/3p2b1/5NP1/P2QPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',I carry on with my plan.
724,20,31,1Bxf3,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/1P6/3p4/5bP1/P2QPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',Rather than just lose the d4 pawn he plays this.
725,20,32,1Bxf3,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2n2q2/1P6/3p4/5BP1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 b - -',I recapture.
726,20,33,1Ne5,b'r3r1k1/pp3ppp/5q2/1P2n3/3p4/5BP1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 w - -',He hits my bishop.
727,20,34,1Bxb7,b'r3r1k1/pB3ppp/5q2/1P2n3/3p4/6P1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 b - -',So I take the b7 pawn instead.
728,20,35,1Rab8,b'1r2r1k1/pB3ppp/5q2/1P2n3/3p4/6P1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 w - -',and he has to move his rook. Now this is the critical position. After the game my opponent criticized my next move Ba6 as it meant my bishop was out of the game. At the time I didn't want to just give up my extra pawn. Also although I knew the bishop was a bit out of the action on a6 at least it protects the pawn on b5 and prevents black from contesting the c file with Rc8. I would be very interested to know your thoughts dear reader! I would also love to know what decent chess computers would play for white in the position?
729,20,36,1Ba6,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/B4q2/1P2n3/3p4/6P1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 b - -',So I retreat my bishop to a6. Naturally Bc6 loses a pawn to Nxc6 followed by Qxc6 and any other retreat just allows Rxb5.
730,20,37,1d3,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/B4q2/1P2n3/8/3p2P1/P2QPP1P/R4RK1 w - -',So a pawn down he decides to try and mix it a bit. Now if I play exd3 he has Rbd8 and he wins the pawn back on d3. 
731,20,38,2f4,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/B4q2/1P2n3/5P2/3p2P1/P2QP2P/R4RK1 b - f3',This is an aggressive reply if knight moves then I can take on d3. Maybe it is a mistake as it weakens my king position?
732,20,39,2Qb6+,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P2n3/5P2/3p2P1/P2QP2P/R4RK1 w - -',He throws in a check
733,20,40,2Kh1,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P2n3/5P2/3p2P1/P2QP2P/R4R1K b - -',I was quite happy with this position. His queen has no checks on the long white diagonal.
734,20,41,2dxe2,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P2n3/5P2/6P1/P2Qp2P/R4R1K w - -',So to avoid the lose of another pawn he has to exchange now.
735,20,42,2Qxe2,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P2n3/5P2/6P1/P3Q2P/R4R1K b - -',and I recapture.
736,20,43,2Nc6,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bqn5/1P6/5P2/6P1/P3Q2P/R4R1K w - -',This move surprised me. I thought he may be aiming for Nb4 and exchanging on a6
737,20,44,2Qc4,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bqn5/1P6/2Q2P2/6P1/P6P/R4R1K b - -',so I put a stop to that
738,20,45,2Nd4,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/R4R1K w - -',He centralises his knight.
739,20,46,2Rfe1,b'1r2r1k1/p4ppp/Bq6/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/R3R2K b - -',I contest the open e file.
740,20,47,2h6,b'1r2r1k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/R3R2K w - -',He wisely gives his king a square. For instance I had been dreaming of variations such as 24....Rbd8 25. Rxe8 Rxe8 26. Rd1 Nf3 27. Qc6 threating Qxe8 mate and if 27.....Qxc6 28. bxc6 he can't play Re2(threatening mate on h2) as I have Rd8 mate!
741,20,48,2Rad1,b'1r2r1k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/3RR2K b - -',Now I think this is the losing mistake. Perhaps Kg2 or Qc3 or d3 prevents the combination that follows. What do you think dear reader?
742,20,49,2Rxe1+,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/3Rr2K w - -',This is more or less forced and I was still quite happy I thought he was giving up control of the e file.
743,20,50,2Rxe1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Qn1P2/6P1/P6P/4R2K b - -',so I recapture.
744,20,51,2Nf3,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Q2P2/5nP1/P6P/4R2K w - -',But this is the problem. If my rook advances he has Qg1 mate or if it moves to any square other than f1 he has Qf2 and Qxh2 mate so f1 it has to be.
745,20,52,2Rf1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Q2P2/5nP1/P6P/5R1K b - -',and it attacks the knight but......
746,20,53,2Nd2,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/2Q2P2/6P1/P2n3P/5R1K w - -',He has this fork and now black is winning. Although a pawn is sometimes enough compensation for being bishop v rook down this is not one of those positions!
747,20,54,2Qd3,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/5P2/3Q2P1/P2n3P/5R1K b - -',so queen moves.
748,20,55,2Nxf1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/5P2/3Q2P1/P6P/5n1K w - -',Knight takes.
749,20,56,2Qxf1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/Bq5p/1P6/5P2/6P1/P6P/5Q1K b - -',queen takes back
750,20,57,2Qe3,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/4q1P1/P6P/5Q1K w - -',his queen centralises
751,20,58,3Qg1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/4q1P1/P6P/6QK b - -',"now normally I wouldn't try and exchange queens when materially down. ""Exchange pawns not pieces when materially down exchange pieces not pawns when materially up"" is the usual advice. However this is not one of those positions. White is in grave danger of being mated by black's queen and rook white the queenless endgame is probably just about ok for white."
752,20,59,3Qe4+,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/4qP2/6P1/P6P/6QK w - -',So for those reasons he does not exchange
753,20,60,3Qg2,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/4qP2/6P1/P5QP/7K b - -',Forced!
754,20,61,3Qb1+,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/P5QP/1q5K w - -',Check again!
755,20,62,3Qg1,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/P6P/1q4QK b - -',forced again
756,20,63,3Qxa2,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/q6P/6QK w - -',He takes a pawn.
757,20,64,3Qxa7,b'1r4k1/Q4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/q6P/7K b - -',I take a pawn.
758,20,65,3Re8,b'4r1k1/Q4pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/q6P/7K w - -',He threatens a mate!
759,20,66,3Qg1,b'4r1k1/5pp1/B6p/1P6/5P2/6P1/q6P/6QK b - -',I defend
760,20,67,3Qa5,b'4r1k1/5pp1/B6p/qP6/5P2/6P1/7P/6QK w - -',He misses a mate in 2! 34....Qd5 would have mated.
761,20,68,3Kg2,b'4r1k1/5pp1/B6p/qP6/5P2/6P1/6KP/6Q1 b - -',So I struggle on.

However I have gained real threats in g4 and b4. 

The real value for me in the move 10. ...g4 is that it actively strikes at the heart of white main idea which is to break through with e4-e5. By forces white to play Ne5 prematurely it forces white to weaken is his control of e5. Thus allowing me to exchange of knights white loses a value piece in the conquest of play e4-e5. Black on the other hand at this point in time retains the option of playing b5-b4"
771,21,8,Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/pb1n1p2/2p1pn1p/1p2N3/2pPP1pP/2N3B1/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',playing ...a5 simply allows white to cement his knight on e5.

Note that the Black pawns on the third rank advancing to the fourth obviate any 'en passant' captures which might have been a nuisance.
1106,28,9,Bh4,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp4p/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',(!?)  Possibly 7.Be3 was an improvement building up his centre.  This bishop could have and probably should have been chased back to g3 after this where it would have been a target for Black's K-side pawns.
1107,28,10,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/pbpn3p/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',(!?) OK but 7...g5 was indicated really.  I did concern myself with the possibility White would try a sac (7...g5  8.Nxg5 fxg5  9.Qh5ch Kd7  10.Bxg5...) but after 10...Qe8 it's not clear that White has much.  Would White have tried it on had I played ....g5?  I wasn't prepared to find out. 
1108,28,11,Bg7,b'r2qk1nr/pbpn2bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',(!?) 8...g5 was still playable with a knight interposing after the bishop check: 8...g5  9.Nxg5?! fxg5  10.Qh5ch Ke7  11.Bxg5ch Ngf6  12.e5 dxe5  13.dxe5 Nxe5 and Black seems to escape with the extra piece.
1109,28,12,O-O,b'r2qk1nr/pbpn2bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White's mobilization is just about complete and he commands more space.  But Black is not far behind and is ready for anything.
1110,28,13,Ne7,b'r2qk2r/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',You might think White has much greater mobility and it's true enough.  But under no particular constraint by White Black's game (in my view) contains a lot of potential energy.   Incidentally there is no real concern that the respective knights will continue on to c6 and f6 taking four tempi to develop to squares reachable at the outset in two!
1111,28,14,1Rc1,b'r2qk2r/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b kq -',I have a feeling that this developing move lacked any real purpose.  Possibly White had in mind to advance the Q-side pawns and bust open the c-file with the advance of that pawn.
1112,28,15,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',With the completion of Black's mobilization there still has been no contact between the respective armies - just a brief skirmish at g5.  But now White makes his first real strike.

The move is OK - there really wasn't anything doing with 12.Nb5 Qb8 -  but it does release quite a lot of the tension that existed along the #5 rank.  Black now casts his eye towards a K-side operation.

But I didn't really consider it deciding to keep out the knight from b5 instead.  This move was later to come in useful...

But it has to be admitted the bishop that has just been chased off had served a useful function in keeping back Black's f-pawn from its usual ...f5 break.  On the other hand it was left a target and is driven to a spot with very little outlook.
1121,28,24,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nn1b1/pp1p1p2/2pPp1pp/2P1P3/1QNB1NBP/PP3PP1/2R2RK1 b - -',Just about forced as ...h4 was threatened.

Already I was beginning to spend almost as much time on this game as all the others combined - though as will be seen this time expenditure was not continually maintained.  I didn't want to play ...h4 - not yet at any rate - as I felt I would need the pawn where it was to obtain leverage against the strong light squares in White's position.  I didn't like ...Qc7 as I wanted that piece able quickly to get to the K-side and the immediate ...Ng6 didn't seem to offer much either.  This bishop move served two purposes: [a] to give support along the light squares on the K-side and [b] to make way for the a8-rook to take up guard duties on b8... should this service be required of it.
1123,28,26,1Be2,b'r1bq1rk1/3nn1b1/pp1p1p2/2pPp1pp/2P1P3/1QN2NBP/PP2BPP1/2R2RK1 b - -',Good move eyeing the loose pawn on h5...

Fair enough: White is the stronger on this flank and the game has developed along lines very similar to a King's Indian Defence - with Black building up a K-side attack and White conducting operations on the other wing.  At that White could probably feel reasonably confident that his K-side is adequately defended.  The light squares in particular are heavily mined.  It will require some preparation to break through there.
1126,28,29,1Nf4,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2b1/pp1p1p2/2pPp1pp/2P1Pn2/1QN2NBP/PP2BPP1/1R3RK1 w - -',A very nice spot for the knight - so strong indeed that White gives up his rather moribund bishop for it.
1127,28,30,1Bxf4,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2b1/pp1p1p2/2pPp1pp/2P1PB2/1QN2N1P/PP2BPP1/1R3RK1 b - -',(!?)  Expected but as confirmed by the GK engine the retreat Bd1 came into consideration.  Black is making progress on the K-side albeit slowly.
1128,28,31,1exf4,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2b1/pp1p1p2/2pP2pp/2P1Pp2/1QN2N1P/PP2BPP1/1R3RK1 w - -',(!)  It was so tempting to take with the g-pawn and open up a file for the rook against the castled White King.  But after 19...gxf4  20.Nh4! it would have been already hard to see Black could proceed.  Maybe 19...gxf4  20.Nh4 f5!  21.Nxf5 Nf6  22.Nxg7 Kxg7  23.Qc2 (preparing the foreshadowed pawn break) ...Rg8  24.b4  Kh6  25.Qd3! Rg7 with very nebulous chances ... for both sides.  The capture played gives Black a fine post at e5 for his remaining knight.
1129,28,32,2Nh2,b'r1bq1rk1/3n2b1/pp1p1p2/2pP2pp/2P1Pp2/1QN4P/PP2BPPN/1R3RK1 b - -',I more than half-expected this though Nd2 also came into consideration.  White is making those light squares very hard to traverse.  Something like 20.Rfe1 instead would certainly have provoked a strong attack: 20.Rfe1? f5!  21.exf5 g4!  22.hxg4 hxg4  23.Nh2 g3  and if 24.fxg3 fxg3  25.Nf3 Ne5 Black would be having the more fun.  Meanwhile Black carries on his attack sacrificing a pawn...
1130,28,33,2Ne5,b'r1bq1rk1/6b1/pp1p1p2/2pPn1pp/2P1Pp2/1QN4P/PP2BPPN/1R3RK1 w - -',(!?)  Giving up a pawn fo the sake of momentum.  But the GK engine doesn't like it one bit preferring to preserve the pawn by ...h4.
1131,28,34,Bxf5,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/pp1p4/2pPnbpB/2P2p2/1QN4P/PP3PPN/1R3RK1 w - -',Attacking the rook at b1.  All very menacing but... Black still hasn't broken past the d1-h5 diagonal that is proving something of a Maginot line...
1132,28,35,2Rbe1,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/pp1p4/2pPnbpB/2P2p2/1QN4P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 b - -',It was after this move that I subjected Black's resources on the K-side to a thorough scrutiny.  Conclusion?  It was stalled for now: no further progress could be made on this wing.  OK if we can't break through let's go round.  The only way is via the Q-side.  But that's where White was supposed to be operating!  As it turns out White is not especially strong on that wing after all so much having been devoted to K-side defence.
1133,28,36,2b5,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/p2p4/1ppPnbpB/2P2p2/1QN4P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 w - -',(!) I do like these sudden switches from one flank to another.  Apart from anything else it shows who is calling the shots!  But things weren't going to go all my way as it transpired...  Incidentally I didn't think much of 23...Nd3 at all.
1134,28,37,axb5,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1ppPnbpB/5p2/1QN4P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 w - -',(!?) This as it happened was a change of mind having originally intended 24...c4 at once: 25.Qb4 (to protect the lead b-pawn) ...Nd3  26.Qxc4 axb5  27.Nxb5 Nxe1  28.Rxe1 Bxb2 but after 29.Bg4!! with an eye the e6-square things didn't look too flash for Black after all.  Maybe somewhere in the middle of that line ...Rc8 would have improved Black's prospects.  
1135,28,38,2Ne4,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1ppPnbpB/4Np2/1Q5P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 b - -',(?) This move took me completely by surprise - and I quite failed to appreciate the implications.  I was fully anticipating 25.Nxb5 (not 25.Qxb5? Bd3!)  25...c4  26.Qb4! but maybe White didn't like his prospects after 26...Nd3 or 23...Rxa2.  Even 23...Qb6 looks OK for Black: 27.Qxd6 Qxb5  28.Rxe5 Bxe5  29.Qxe5 Rxa2.  Whether any of these lines would have led to much for Black is hard to say but I can well understand if White wasn't prepared to test them.  But as it transpires this Knight move was the mistake that brought White back into the game!  
1136,28,39,2c4,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1p1PnbpB/2p1Np2/1Q5P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 w - -',(?!) Thematic but played much too hastily.  After spending so much time on the game this was one of the moves I played with almost no reflexion at all.  A bit more thought about the implications of White's previous move might have revealed the power of 25...Ra4! and Black would have a formidible initiative on both sides of the board.
1137,28,40,2Qxb5,b'r2q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1Q1PnbpB/2p1Np2/7P/PP3PPN/4RRK1 b - -',(!) Of course.  Thinking 'nothing much has really changed just take on a2' Black continued...

1139,28,42,2Nf3,b'3q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1Q1PnbpB/2p1Np2/5N1P/rP3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',(!?) Again an unanticipated move (27.Nc3) but it may be the best!
1140,28,43,2g4,b'3q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1Q1Pnb1B/2p1Npp1/5N1P/rP3PP1/4RRK1 w - -',(?) A complete miscalculation as the GK engine observes.  Originally planning on ...Rxb2 I had the uneasy feeling that I'd already let the advantage if not the initiative withal slip away from me (that rook move I overlooked two moves back of course!).  This move was a violent attempt to wrest back the initiative that should have got the kicking it deserved.
1141,28,44,2hxg4,b'3q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1Q1Pnb1B/2p1NpP1/5N2/rP3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',(?!)  This really ought to get a (?) as 28.Nxe5 would have placed the  advantage firmly in White's hands.  I had completely overlooked that possibility assuming as I (ought to) know better than to do that White would retake on g4.  However this recapture leaves the game finely balanced: all on for a battle royal for the initiative!
1142,28,45,2Rxb2,b'3q1rk1/6b1/3p4/1Q1Pnb1B/2p1NpP1/5N2/1r3PP1/4RRK1 w - -',(!) As you were.  Of course the rook may not be taken (29.Qxb2; Nxf3ch) but White has attacking chances of his own.  
1143,28,46,2Qa6,b'3q1rk1/6b1/Q2p4/3Pnb1B/2p1NpP1/5N2/1r3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',(!) Things are starting to look a bit weird as the pieces considerably outnumber the pawns.  This became more pronounced later on...
1144,28,47,2Nxg4,b'3q1rk1/6b1/Q2p4/3P1b1B/2p1Npn1/5N2/1r3PP1/4RRK1 w - -',(!?)  The alternative 29...Rb6 might actually have been better but I wanted to push the issue.  This involved some risk though I felt sure that I could always bale to a draw if things went turnip shaped. 
1145,28,48,3Bxg4,b'3q1rk1/6b1/Q2p4/3P1b2/2p1NpB1/5N2/1r3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',(!?) As you'd expect.  But as it transpired White missed a fine opportunity right here.  The Queen sacrifices itself for very promising endgame prospects:  30.Nxd6! Rb6  31.Qxb6!! (What the...?) 31...Qxb6  32.Nxf5 Rxf5  33.Bxg4 Rf8  34.Re6 ... and White has a lot of pressure on Black's position.  Well I didn't see it at the time.  As it happens the GK engine also gives White a plus after 30.Qxc4 Nf6  31.Nxf6.  So Black was running close to the extreme edge here!
1146,28,49,3Qxc4,b'3q1rk1/6b1/3p4/3P4/2Q1Npb1/5N2/1r3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',Resources have become very slender with few pawns remaining but a heck of a lot of pieces.  By the way the 2B bs 2N motif was largely meaningless in this position so Black's next is hardly surprising...
1147,28,50,Rf5,b'3q2k1/6b1/3p4/3P1r2/2Q1Np2/5P2/1r3P2/4RRK1 w - -',Aiming for the g- and h-files...
1148,28,51,3Qc6,b'3q2k1/6b1/2Qp4/3P1r2/4Np2/5P2/1r3P2/4RRK1 b - -',(?) The GK engine calls this a mistake preferring 33.Rc1.  Possibly the latter frees the immobile f1-Rook...
1149,28,52,3Rb4,b'3q2k1/6b1/2Qp4/3P1r2/1r2Np2/5P2/5P2/4RRK1 w - -',(!) Against an opponent with a similar rating or greater than mine I would most likely have cut straight to the draw with 33...Rg5ch.  But I still thought the game offered Black chances of more.  The threat is ...Rxe4 with mate then looming on the g- or h-file.  I didn't much like ...Rb6 but maybe it ought to have been looked further into with ...Rb7 as a possible follow-up.
1150,28,53,3Qxd6,b'3q2k1/6b1/3Q4/3P1r2/1r2Np2/5P2/5P2/4RRK1 b - -',(!?) Suddenly things weren't so simple.  White's salvation it was becoming clear lay in the timely retreat Ne4-g3 giving up the knight for the likely Rook and Bishop vs Rook ending.  This called for some very intricate manoeuvring with no guarantee that Black would get more than the draw even then.    I admit that the Ng3 move I had anticipated somewhat down the track but the GK engine recommends it right here (34.Ng3!) giving Black only a minimal advantage.
1151,28,54,3Rg5+,b'3q2k1/6b1/3Q4/3P2r1/1r2Np2/5P2/5P2/4RRK1 w - -',It was this or 34...Qxd6 at once.  I figured that they transposed into the same line but stand to be corrected on this.
1152,28,55,3Kh1,b'3q2k1/6b1/3Q4/3P2r1/1r2Np2/5P2/5P2/4RR1K b - -',(?)  I notice the GK engine also points to this as a mistake.  At the time I had a feeling this might lead to more for Black than Kh2 would have done as the latter might have allowed the f1-rook to slip out via g1 or h1.  At any rate the real reason why this retreat turns out badly will emerge later...

The idea was that Black runs out of pawns after say 38.Re4 Rdxd6  39.Rxf4  Rh6ch  40.Kg2 Rg6ch  41.Rg4 If a pair of rooks come off Black has just R and B vs R and 2P and somehow it was hard to imagine that the two pawns would transform a book draw (R and B vs R and no pawns!) into a loss.  To realise any advantage after 38.Re4 Black would have had to proceed much more subtly.

Having said that the knight move was what I expected and it still looked as though it might hold.

Surely 2R plus B vs 2R is no better than with one rook apiece?  And White has extra pawns into the bargain.  The answer lay in the poor position of White's King.  Had it stood at h2 the win for Black if one existed at all would have been very problematic.
1160,28,63,Rd2,b'4R3/6bk/6r1/8/8/5PP1/3r4/5R1K w - -',(!) The key to White's castle.  Having left the second rank the pawns can not shield the White King who is imprisoned in his own dungeon.

Nf6 however seemed like it would be fun (it was a blitz game anyway :P) and aggressive...nice!
