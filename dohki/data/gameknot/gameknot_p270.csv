by that move it will be hard for black to develope his king side pieces."
10,1,1,f3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4pp2/8/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nf3 is better in order to prevent e5 from black.
11,1,2,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3PP3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',white is left with a strong center.
12,1,3,bxc3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/3PP3/2P2P2/P5PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',white has a great space to play in and a strong center. black had not move any piece yet.
13,1,4,d5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/3P4/4P3/2P2P2/P5PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',maybe too soon. I think that Bc4 is much better.
14,1,5,c4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/3P4/2P1P3/5P2/P5PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',white has played with his pawns too far. it is important to remember that pawns cant play backwards and they need pieces to support them from behind.

27,2,3,Kxd8,b'r1bk3r/p3ppbp/1pp3p1/8/4n3/2P1B2P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R w KQ -',by playing 8. h3 white got the same ending I wrote last note but with one pawn down.

33,2,9,2c4,b'r7/2k3b1/2p3pp/1pBb1p2/pPP1p3/5P1P/P3B1P1/1KR5 b - -',why would white do that. if white wants a chance to draw the game he must change bishops from the opposite color not the same...
34,2,10,Bd4,b'1r6/2k5/2p3pp/2B2p2/pP1b4/5P1P/P1R5/1K6 w - -',! a very nice move.

67,4,1,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3', Nevertheless if you're going to play it you may as well do so aggressively and 4. h4 is fairly aggressive - without being 100% committal.  By forcing Black to advance his g-pawn White hopes to pick up the weakened f-pawn later.
68,4,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5n2/3pN3/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',A useful freeing move for Black.  He's happy to give back the pawn in return for open play and a counter attack.
69,4,3,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b4/3PN2n/2BP1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Black now has a plethora of options: should he take on h4 with his queen (hoping for a quick mate after ...g3 and Qh2  )? or maybe castle immediately now that White has opened the e-file?  The move played (...Ng3) attacks the rook on f1 but I would have marginally prefered getting another piece out rather than moving an existing one.  Incidentally if 9...Qxh4 White would play 10. Bxf4 and then if 10...Nxf4 White recaptures with the rook and Black can't advance his g-pawn immediately since it is pinned to his queen.
70,4,4,Ng3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b4/3PN3/2BP1ppP/6n1/PPP3P1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Attacking the rook on f1.  White is pretty much forced to give up the exchange here.  If he tries to save it with 10. Re1 (or 10. Rf2) then Black simply plays 10...Qxh4 and the check on h1 will be curtains!
71,4,5,1Bxf4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b4/3PN3/2BP1BpP/6n1/PPP3P1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Finally capturing the stubborn f-pawn.  Black now has another chance to take on h4.  However after 10...Qxh4 11.Bxg3 11...Qxg3 the f-file would be opened for the rook and things could prove difficult for Black. (Note in that case that White shouldn't take on f7 immediately (12. Nxf7??) since that would open the b8-h2 diagonal for the Black bishop and allow the akward 12...Qh2 !)
72,4,6,f6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp4p/3b1p2/3PN3/2BP1BpP/8/PPP3P1/RN3QK1 w kq -',I'm not sure about this though.  11...Qxh4 was to be preferred.  The problem with ...f6 is that it weakens the white sqaures around Black's king but White on the other hand is not obliged to move the attacked knight - he can sacrifice it instead!...
73,4,7,1Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp4p/3b1p2/3PN3/2BP1BpP/2N5/PPP3P1/R4QK1 b kq -',(!) Played more or less on intuition...
74,4,8,1fxe5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp4p/3b4/3Pp3/2BP1BpP/2N5/PPP3P1/R4QK1 w kq -',Quite correct - Black will need as much material as possible in the coming fireworks...
75,4,9,1Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp4p/3b4/3Pp1B1/2BP2pP/2N5/PPP3P1/R4QK1 b kq -',A crucial moment.  Black's Q is attacked. He doesn't want to play ...Be7 as that allows 14. d6! (opening the Bc4's diagonal) and then mate on f7 or loss of the Be7 follows.  Equally playing 13...Qd7 instead blocks in his Bishop on c8 and invites White to try for Bb5 at some point pinning Queen against King.
76,4,10,1Qd7,b'rnb1k2r/pppq3p/3b4/3Pp1B1/2BP2pP/2N5/PPP3P1/R4QK1 w kq -',The lesser of two evils.

82,4,16,Bf5,b'rn2k2r/ppp4p/8/2bPPbB1/2B1Q1pP/2N5/PPP2qP1/R6K w kq -',White has nowhere to put his queen other than back on e2 where it will be exchanged. So... he just leaves it where it is!
83,4,17,1Bb5+,b'rn2k2r/ppp4p/8/1BbPPbB1/4Q1pP/2N5/PPP2qP1/R6K b kq -',The only way. By clearing the fourth rank White makes way for his Queen - it can go accross to a4 if necessary.
84,4,18,1c6,b'rn2k2r/pp5p/2p5/1BbPPbB1/4Q1pP/2N5/PPP2qP1/R6K w kq -',Now it's Black's turn to slip.  He didn't want to block the check with ...Nd7 because of 19. e6 attacking the pinned piece.  In that variation as in the game White sacs his queen: 18...Nd7 19. e6! and now if 19...Bxe4 White has 20. Bxd7  20...Kf8 (forced) 21. Nxe4 (forking Q and B) and Black must either allow his Queen to be taken or move it to d4 and permit perpetual check with 22. Rf1  ...Kg8 and 23. Nf6  (if 22... Kg7? 23 Bf6  wins the Queen).  Wild stuff!

86,4,20,1Kf8,b'rn3k1r/pp5p/2P5/1Bb1PbB1/4Q1pP/2N5/PPP2qP1/R6K w - -',If Black had captured 19...Bxe4 White has 20. cxb7  (disc.) 20...Nd7 21.Nxe4 (getting rid of the defender of a8) and now either white makes a new queen while at the same time capturing the Ra8 or - if Black blocks with 21...Rb8 - 22. Nxf2!  The final twist is that although Black can now capture the knight on f2 with 22...Bxf2 (when he'll be momentarily ahead on material again) this allows the crushing 23. e6! winning the pinned knight.  In this last variation White will be two pawns up one of which is on d7 just ready to make another queen!
87,4,21,2cxb7,b'rn3k1r/pP5p/8/1Bb1PbB1/4Q1pP/2N5/PPP2qP1/R6K b - -',Giving Black another chance to take his queen on e4.

Black had several better alternatives including Qg4 protecting against the white Q's potential check at e6 a serious threat. Black here wastes a tempo when he should try to regain some initiative and mount a defense to gain time. The loss of his remaining R is imminent. Black's thrust here is premature.

This move is superior the more languid NxR after which Black's can gain time or mount a credible attack with for instance N(f)g4 or e4 putting White's K at risk for a withering attack and taking advantage of White's cramped B and useless R. Note how the text move also guards the e4 and g4 squares as well thus providing a defense against the advance of the Black N to support his Q's would-be aggression.

His back rank is protected against further checks by the White Q by his two Ns. Kb8 gives Black time to regroup. The text move leads to mate in two. Some possible lines:
16. Qe6  Kb8 17. Qxf6 Rg8 18. Nxg5 a6 with material even and an escape square for the Black king.
16. Qe6  Kb8 17 Nxh8 Be7 with Black able to protect his remaining pieces and also block mate on the back rank buying him time to mobilize the Q.

It did not have to end for Black on move 18 but 16... Nd7 sank his remaining hopes.

Black started out well enough but cramped his own pieces especially the Q early on and eventually reaped the results. Also he did not sufficiently analyze all the possibilities inherent in the dynamic situation that was present at move 12. By move 17 he had lost his focus it would seem. A reminder to us all to take time to carefully look at the complexity of each situation and not the immediate appearance.

Just in case there is any uncertainty with regards to the rules of this popular game here is a summarised version of the 'Blide Verpoinian Chess rules'

___
1.1 Nature and Objectives:


All pieces behave in the same way as they do in conventional chess moves alternate as usual.

The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king the game is a draw.
___
6.1 Special Rules:

If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose' 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable.

If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion.

If for any reason either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.

He had a controversial chess style - at the time a respected only-recently-retired chess analyst commenting on one of his games had remarked; 'his moves are stupid his tactics are stupid he's impatient and he's an outrageous cheater - If he gets to the final I'll retire'. This tournament was said to have been the first he had ever entered and won his first game against Garl Trowlaph (no. 4 in the Wackyworld chess standings) with an astonishing 600000 to 1 odds against him.

the referee repeated 'which piece are you going to promote to?'
'I wanna promote to pawn' said Jabborg 
'that's not allowed' 'it's allowed if I says it's allowed' 'well I'm sorry but you have to choose between a rook knight bishop or queen' (the nervous phrappenite had begun to sweat) Jabborg's brutish arm had picked up the referee by his wings and threatened 'I don't think you heard me right mate I promote to a pawn otherwise I'm going to promote you to a friggin sack of phrappenite body parts'.

 a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty' over the years the expression was adopted in many sports including cloud-surfing cloud-skiing cloud-jesting cloud-chestnuting cloud-chess and eventually chess."

365,15,30,6Kd4,b'rn6/n7/4k3/8/3K4/8/7N/6NR b - -',At this point the game had reached a state of equilibrium and both players had now begun to collect themselves.

369,15,34,7Ke4,b'rn6/n7/3k4/8/4K3/8/7N/6NR b - -',With both players reluctant to attack with their corner-fort resources the game was apparently going nowhere. At this point the referee suggested to both players that they take a break and then finish the game with a 'Habbajoop duel' - Jabborg and Safeway enthusiastically agreed and adjourned to their respective dressing rooms. The referee then activated the Moonlagoom Hall tannoy (which is also connected to a speaker system in Moonlagoom park) and announced that the game was to be decided by a 'Habbajoop duel' and a 5 minute intermission would take place.
370,15,35,Kb2,b'rn6/n5K1/8/8/8/8/1k5N/6NR w - -',During the intermission the chess records explain that after the referee had set-up the board to habbajoop formation there was curious discussion taking place within the audience - many spectators were asking each other if they knew what a 'habbajoop duel' was. The sympathetic Phrappenite referee decided to use the tannoy to explain the rules and use the chess board (which was projected on a wall in Moonlagoom hall as well as clearly visible to spectators outside via video screen) to demonstrate the nature of the game.
371,15,36,Nb5,b'r7/3n2K1/8/1n6/6N1/5N2/1k6/7R w - -',Thanks to a squoppulant scirbe present at the game the referee's exact words were recorded; 'The rules to Habbajoop dueling are as follows; both players must use only their own knights and attempt to 'Joop' or 'Sandwich' 1 or both of the opposing knights whilst avoiding capturing any of the knights or checking the opponent's king -'

378,15,43,10Nh2,b'rn6/n5K1/8/8/8/8/1k5N/6NR b - -',With Safeway and Jabborg returning from their dressing rooms the referee rounded up his explanation; 'knights can only joop within the b7:G2 grid and players must make their moves immediately after their opponent has moved - only a split second delay is allowed as soon as a player has been 'jooped' they must present their rook to a1 (if white) or h8 (if black) so that the opponent's king can capture and that colour will win the game!'
379,15,44,10Nb5,b'rn6/6K1/8/1n6/8/8/1k5N/6NR w - -',To any Verponian-Habbajoop-duel chess students who may be using this annotation it may be helpful to use the annotation window (click the small window symbol) and rapidly click 'next move' between moves 109 and 127 to simulate the actual game which took place between these 2 chess titans.
380,15,45,Nb4,b'r7/6K1/8/1n6/1n4N1/5N2/1k6/7R w - -',Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.

391,15,56,12Ne4,b'r7/6K1/8/8/4NnN1/2n5/1k6/7R b - -',After this move a huge cheer had gone up in the audience Safeway had gloriously punched his arms into the sky and Jabborg was just staring at the horizontal joop in utter disbelief. 
392,15,57,12Rh8,b'7r/6K1/8/8/4NnN1/2n5/1k6/7R w - -',Completely gutted Jabborg with a sulkish facial expression reluctantly moved his rook to h8 (so that Safeway can capture the final rook and win the game - as the rule dictates)
393,15,58,12Ra1,b'7r/6K1/8/8/4NnN1/2n5/1k6/R7 b - -',Safeway with a gladdened look of relief calmly stretched from his chair to the other side of the board to capture the rook_____ But as he was about to Jabborg suddenly very violently kicked one of the legs of Safeway's chair causing him to come crashing down on to the chess board and seriously injuring his left shoulder! Lord Jabborg quickly stood up and roared; 'MAGGOT MOOSE!!!'. Jabborg (still stood up) viciously hurled Safeway off the chess board and after plonking the white rook on a1 - 
394,15,59,12Kxa1,b'7r/6K1/8/8/4NnN1/2n5/8/k7 w - -',Capturing! The spectators in Moonlagoom hall and the audience outside were stunned into silence. Lord Jabborg (holding up the recently-captured white rook in one hand and the Krompoborg trophy in the other) was staring out to the audience with a victorious mad glare laughing like a maniac. His evil laugh was apparently heard as far as the Graw City outskirts and a commentator of the match had likened his powerful winning-player manner to the intimidating personality of a political dictator. 1 month following this game Lord Jabborg had become mayor of Graw city 1 year later he had become president of Zaltang and 6 months after that the Verponian race had declared war on the Purple ocean and many races (particularly Kweedites) had been chased out of their homes separated from their families brutally tortured or even destroyed.

512,23,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nc6. I didn't really care for moving any of the center pawns just yet.

White does control e5 but his white squares are weak and he creates a backward pawn on e3. For those of you who don't know what a backward pawn is it's a pawn that cannot be guarded by another pawn. Thus he has to commit one of his pieces to defending it if it gets attacked.

763,37,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1. e4 often leads to open games characterized by pawn exchanges in the center and freedom of movement for the pieces.  Notice that two lines have been opened already one for the bishop on f1 and one for the queen.
764,37,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian defense.  Only one line is opened (for the queen) and black may fall behind in development.  The main idea is to trade a wing pawn (black's c-pawn) for a center pawn (white's d-pawn).  The reasoning is that the extra center pawn will allow black to eventually control the center.
765,37,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Developing towards the center.  This move paves the way towards early castling and increases white's chances of controlling the center.
766,37,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The fianchetto (wing development) of the bishop caught many classic players off guard.  At first glance it doesn't seem to have any centralizing effect.  However the bishop is going to move to g7 where it will strike at the center squares on d4 and e5.  It is fairly difficult to challenge this bishop and the fianchetto has proven a tough nut to crack.  This variation of the Sicilian is called the Accelerated Dragon.
767,37,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Immediately challenging the center.  The great Danish player Larsen called this a strategic mistake but most theorists consider this the most promising way to challenge black's intentions.
768,37,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black has achieved his initial goal of captuing white's d-pawn with the c-pawn.
769,37,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',At first glance White seems to have an advantage both in development and space.  Generally such an advantage would prompt you to initiate an attack.  It is too early to do so now and the challenge wll be to preserve this advantage while completing the rest of white's development. 
770,37,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black challenges the control over d4 and e5.  Notice that 5. Nxc6 plays into blacks hands.  After 5. ...bxc6 black is no longer behind in development has a sound pawn structure and better prospects for long term control over the center.
771,37,8,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',Establishing the Maroczy bind named after the great Hungarian master of old.  White is trying to prevent black from ever playing d7-d5.  White will maintain an advantage in space but the extra pawn move allows black to start catching up in development.
772,37,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Developing towards the center.  Note that 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. e5 fails to 7. ...Qa5 .

774,37,11,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black spends a tempo (one unit of time) to defend against that threat.
775,37,12,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White wants to complete his development and 7. Be2 prepares castling.

778,37,15,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black intends to castle complete his development and only then strike out at white's center.
779,37,16,Be3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White usually plays the bishop to e3 or g5 in order to have the d2 square available for the queen.
780,37,17,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now Black threatens 10. ...Ng4 with a double attack (on white's queen and on the bishop on e3.)  White does not want to exchange the dark square bishop for the knight.  That would leave the bishop on g7 as the best minor piece on the board.
781,37,18,1Qd1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',More usual is 10. Qd2 although the text is by all means playable.  White may have wanted to get out of the well known lines and go down a side path.
782,37,19,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/8/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Typically black tries for counter play on the queenside.  The bishop develops towards the center and attacks white's c-pawn.
783,37,20,1Bd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/8/2PBP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',White doesn't mind trading the dark square bishops because that takes much of the sting out of black's setup.  11. 0-0 is another good alternative.
784,37,21,1Qa5,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/q7/2PBP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black wants to clear the back rank and connect his rooks.  One of the interesting things about the geometry of the chessboard is that moving the queen to the edge also activates it in the center.  Do you see how from a5 the queen attacks the key central squares d5 and e5 as well as the less crucial but still important squares c5 and f5?
785,37,22,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/q7/2PBP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White has maintained his advantage in space but is now lagging a bit in development.  Black must try to take advantage of this soon or risk drifting into passivity.
786,37,23,1Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/q7/2PBP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Which rook belongs on the c-file?  Black is hoping to open more lines on the queenside so leaves the rook on a8 where it is for now and activates the other rook.
787,37,24,1b3,b'r1r3k1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/q7/2PBP3/1PN5/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Securing the c-pawn but it also represents an additional weakening of the dark squares in whites center and queenside.  White is counting on the bishop on d4 to compensate.
788,37,25,1a6,b'r1r3k1/1p2ppbp/p2pbnp1/q7/2PBP3/1PN5/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black would love to be able to play b7-b5 at some point and a6 increases his chances of doing so.
789,37,26,1f4,b'r1r3k1/1p2ppbp/p2pbnp1/q7/2PBPP2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - f3',14. Nd5 is also promising.  White is increasing his spatial advantage.
790,37,27,1Rab8,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p2pbnp1/q7/2PBPP2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Again with an eye towards an eventual b7-b5.
791,37,28,1Qd3,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p2pbnp1/q7/2PBPP2/1PNQ4/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',A move with multiple purposes.  It provides additional suppoprt to the knight on c3 discourages b7-b5 and assists f4-f5.  The f4-f5 push is the usual plan in these types of positions.
792,37,29,1Bd7,b'1rr3k1/1p1bppbp/p2p1np1/q7/2PBPP2/1PNQ4/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Probably not best.  Black is still thinking about b7-b5.  15. ...Ne8 was more prudent and 15. ...b7-b5 more thematic.  In the latter line black sacrifices a pawn for piece activity hoping to win it back under more favorable circumstances.
793,37,30,1e5,b'1rr3k1/1p1bppbp/p2p1np1/q3P3/2PB1P2/1PNQ4/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',A good aggressive continuation taking advantage of white's edge in space.

797,37,34,1Qxe5,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p4np1/q3Qb2/2PB1P2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',This was came as a surprise and was a big relief.  18. fxe5 keeps the pressure on and even 18. Bxe5 was to be preferred.  When you have an edge in space generally speaking you should avoid exchanges.  When you are cramped seek them out.
798,37,35,1Qxe5,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p4np1/4qb2/2PB1P2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black is very happy to get the queens off of the board.
799,37,36,1Bxe5,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p4np1/4Bb2/2P2P2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',White may have underestimated the small combination at black's disposal in this position.
800,37,37,1Ng4,b'1rr3k1/1p2ppbp/p5p1/4Bb2/2P2Pn1/1PN5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Finally exploiting the weakened dark squares.

802,37,39,2Kxg7,b'1rr5/1p2ppkp/p5p1/5b2/2P2Pn1/1PN5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',After the exchanges any spatially advantage for white is much less important.  White's advantage in the endgame now shifts to a 3 on 2 pawn majority on the queenside.  Both sides will want to create a passed pawn but only white's will be an outside passed pawn which means the pawn will be on the other side of the board from the kings and therefore more difficult to stop.
803,37,40,2Nd5,b'1rr5/1p2ppkp/p5p1/3N1b2/2P2Pn1/1P6/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',A logical move advancing into black's position with the threat of capturing the e-pawn.

806,37,43,2Nf6,b'1r2r3/1p2ppkp/p4np1/3N1b2/2P2P2/1P5P/P3B1P1/R4RK1 w - -',Black has just about equalized now.  Most of the endgames are fairly balanced.

811,37,48,2g4,b'3rr3/1p2ppkp/p4np1/8/2P1bPP1/1P2N2P/P3B3/3R1RK1 b - g3',It would be better to expand on the queenside with 25. a3 and then b3-b4.  You want to play on the side where you have the advantage.  White might as well waste no time trying to create an outside passed pawn.
812,37,49,2Bc6,b'3rr3/1p2ppkp/p1b2np1/8/2P2PP1/1P2N2P/P3B3/3R1RK1 w - -',Staying on the long diagonal and freeing up the e4 square for the knight.
813,37,50,2Rxd8,b'3Rr3/1p2ppkp/p1b2np1/8/2P2PP1/1P2N2P/P3B3/5RK1 b - -',The posiiton is essentially even.  White decides to swap rooks which is niether good nor bad.  It's just a different type of endgame.
814,37,51,2Rd1,b'3r4/1p2ppkp/p1b2np1/8/2P2PP1/1P2N2P/P3B3/3R2K1 b - -',Continuing with the exchange of rooks.
815,37,52,2Rxd1+,b'8/1p2ppkp/p1b2np1/8/2P2PP1/1P2N2P/P3B3/3r2K1 w - -',Black is happy to oblige.  The only danger was ceding control of the d-file to white and that is no longer an issue.
816,37,53,2Bxd1,b'8/1p2ppkp/p1b2np1/8/2P2PP1/1P2N2P/P7/3B2K1 b - -',BIshop vs. knight endings can be quite thorny.  The two pieces don't really work too well with one another.  Straight bishop or straight knight ending are usually clearer.
817,37,54,2Ne4,b'8/1p2ppkp/p1b3p1/8/2P1nPP1/1P2N2P/P7/3B2K1 w - -',If I had to do it over again I'd probably throw in 28. ...h6 first.
818,37,55,2Bf3,b'8/1p2ppkp/p1b3p1/8/2P1nPP1/1P2NB1P/P7/6K1 b - -',There is a tactical problem with this move which we both over looked.

821,37,58,3b6,b'8/5pkp/ppb1p1p1/8/2P1nPP1/1P3B1P/P1N5/6K1 w - -',Flustered black makes a mistake.  30. ..Nc3 was still the best move.

The ending was very tactical and we were both on autopilot.  Endings are the most neglected aspect of chess.  Time spent studying endings pays dividends in the opening and middlegame as well.
