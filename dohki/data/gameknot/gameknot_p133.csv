This is the opening move -- Knight to a3.  I've looked up this opening move on Chess.com and most everybody hates it.  They say things that it was a stupid move.  Or it's hilarious.  However it's not an attack so much as it is a feint. A Feint is defined as: ""a movement made in order to deceive an adversary; an attack aimed at one place or point merely as a distraction from the real place or point of attack.""  Na3 is a feint on your opponent.  It's designed to lull your opponent into a false sense of security.  My opponent moved his king pawn to e5 following my feint.   "

This is a game where I thought i was well of from the opening but followed a faulty plan and made a lot of errors and lost in the end. And what shall we do when we lose in a way that alomost disgust us? We take the whip and torment ourselves some more and hopefully learn a lesson!
124,4,1,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now we have a sort of delayed sort of the c3-sicilian - black won't be able to play ...d5 in one move but then again the move e5 which white frequently uses in case of ...Nf6 is not so easily arranged.

Black probably shouldn't mind exchaning this bishop because it lacks a duty.

The attack against the b-pawn is actually quite irritating as whites queens knight has no other defenders at the moment. That attack is parried easy enough but black counted on getting some play after 13...Nxe3. 

The other way to create pawn weaknesses is 12...Nxf3 but the idea looks a little suspect as white would get the important e5 square with gxf3 and eventually f4"

IMO black has the advantage seeing that he has the better pawn structure long term dark-square pressure and an no obvious weaknesses. The bishop pair does not seem to be anything to boast in this position though I think I didn't understand it during the game. I still feel a sting in my soul when looking at this position and thinking that I managed to lose in the end...

I had a fleeting thought that if i combined pressure against e3- and e4-pawns I could bottle up white for good and then induce some more weaknesses but of course I didn't realize that i have no way to attack the e4-pawn more than once. And what about the rooks where do they want to be? on the c-file of course so why block it? 

I was afraid that if I didn't move the knight I would have to reply ...Bxf3 if white played h3. This is quite understandable I think and this move might even be a good one but my thought process went a little astray at this point.

The problem for black here is the light squared bishop. It has nowhere to go and ...Bxf3 is a bad trade as gxf3 followed by f4 obviously improves whites posiotion. Ideally black would like to exchange it with white's lsb play knight to e5 (with the intention to go to g4 or c4) and if white plays b3 then exploit the c-file and c3-square."

During the game I remember thinking that White was cramped and I should avoid exchanges. But that's not really true as white is just tied defending the pawn weaknesses and is just about ready gain some activity. Now if we look the position we see that it is black who is sligthly cramped - the knight and bishop needs the same squares. And what purpose the LSB have anyway? "

He starts with Kings pawn."
189,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I reply with kings pawn too.
190,6,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',He wants to offer a pawns exchange or to have a strong center after d5 if I ignore his pawn. Personally I think this is a bad idea since he'll have to play immediate queen capture or will have to fight tougher to recapture the pawn later. And for those who don't know why queen can't be brought out before other pieces have developed just continue viewing the game.

195,6,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Okay let's keep the development and forcing him to play defensive.
196,6,8,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q2B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',Nice pinning.
197,6,9,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/3Q2B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',Now my knight is pinned... But developing my bishop while also opening way for castling looks the best here for me. It also counterpins my knight so now he has his queen en-prise again.
198,6,10,Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2B2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',He takes it of course. He would have regretted not doing so.
199,6,11,Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',I recapture my bishop ends up challenging his b-pawn so again he's got to lose tempo in defense.
200,6,12,Bc4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',Looks like he's determined to put me in trouble. He's menacing mate in f7.

203,6,15,Bxb2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/2B1P3/5N2/PbP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Well b-pawn is gone and nothing can help that rock now.

If exchanges take place I'll lose my queen and rock against his queen bishop and knight so pretty welcome. He can't push the e-pawn. I'd immediately capture it with Queen giving him a check. He either moves his king or exchanges queens and this will be over much faster.
206,6,18,1h4,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/3Q2N1/2B1P2P/8/PbP2PP1/RN2K2R b KQ h3',I guess he wants to keep his grip on my castle there.

If I capture his knight with the pawn he recaptures puting my queen en-prise and leaving a totally open h-file where he could add all his remaining forces to trap my king in a castled position where I have not much way to escape. My own defending pieces would be my tomb. So no not worth the ""free knight""."

212,6,24,1e5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3QP1N1/1nB2P1P/6P1/PbP5/RN2K2R b KQ -',He's going for the queen exchanges.

214,6,26,1fxe5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5q1p/3QP1N1/1nB4P/6P1/PbP5/RN2K2R b KQ -',He captures now again there is both queens en-prise. At this position I could easily win the pawn with the Bishop but then he would lift up c pawn to protect his rock. I would capture it with bishop check. He captures with knight I could capture with queen check but then he just would lift up his king and his rocks would be connected. My queen couldn't go for the rock anymore and I'd have to cope up with 3 pieces of his still over my f7 weak position... so no. Exchanges would happen now and still I would win the pawn.
215,6,27,1Nxd5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5q1p/3nP1N1/2B4P/6P1/PbP5/RN2K2R w KQ -',I capture with knight. This way he's forced to capture my queen first or be in serious disadvantage. And he only can capture it with the pawn. And after he does my knight will both come off his bishop range and capture the pawn.
216,6,28,1exf6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5P1p/3n2N1/2B4P/6P1/PbP5/RN2K2R b KQ -',His only good choice.
217,6,29,1Nxf6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/6N1/2B4P/6P1/PbP5/RN2K2R w KQ -',And the only one I had to keep the material advantage... at this point I'm 2 pawns ahead but my bishop is still having his rock so I'll have an easy endgame once I start exchanging all I can.
218,6,30,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/6N1/2B4P/6P1/PbP5/RN3RK1 b - -',He castles trying to give his king a little safety that has come a bit too late. Besides he's aiming to keep his grip in f7. I have to balance it.
219,6,31,1hxg5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5n2/6p1/2B4P/6P1/PbP5/RN3RK1 w - -',So I get rid of the future menace over f7. If he captures the pawn I send my knight to e4 for a pawns fork. I bet he's more worried about losing a whole rock with nothing in return so my guesses at this point is he'll move his knight.
220,6,32,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/5n2/6p1/2B4P/6P1/PbPN4/R4RK1 b - -',My guesses correct. He connects his rocks.

292,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Ik heb gemerkt dat jij in onze partijen meestal opent met e2-e4 en daar is zeker niets mis mee. Veel trainers bevelen deze zet aan voor beginners omdat de partij vaak in rap tempo tactisch wordt. Dit is belangrijk omdat de uitslag van schaakpartijen voor verreweg de grootste deel afhankelijk is van de tactische sterkte van de spelers. 

Nadat ik zoveel nadruk leg op tactiek vraag jij je waarschijnlijk af wat tactiek in het schaakspel nou is. Aangezien ik nu genant veel moeite heb om een korte uitleg te geven zal ik jou helaas moeten vervelen met een zeer lange uitleg. 

Het uiteindelijke doel van schaken is het schaakmat zetten van de tegenstander. In de vorige partij die ik analyseerde gaf jij twee stukken weg zodat jij de koning van de tegenstander beter kon aanvallen. Jouw tegenstander verdedigde echter tegen de dreigingen begon stukken af te ruilen en kon jou uiteindelijk mat zetten toen jij geen stukken meer over had. Een directe koningsaanval heeft dus lang niet altijd zin en ik zal later eens uitleggen hoe jij kunt inschatten wanneer een koningsaanval kans heeft op slagen en wanneer niet. Ik ga er nu niet op in omdat op jouw sterkte partijen meestal worden gewonnen door het verkrijgen van een ruime materiaal voordeel. Ik geloof dat jij nu enigzins weet hoe de waarde van de stukken verhouden ten opzichte van elkaar en dus zal ik daar niet diep op in gaan. Wel zal ik zeggen dat zelfs een Pion (de minst waardevolle eenhoud van jouw team) het verschil kan maken tussen winst en verlies. Je mag hem dus niet zonder nadenken offeren of weggeven. Materiaal is belangrijk!
Hoe ontstaan verschillen in materiaal? Ze ontstaan doordat stukken van verschillende waarde met elkaar worden geruild of omdat een stuk/pion gratis gepakt kan worden. Als jij ziet dat materiaal van de tegenstander gepakt kan worden zonder dat het jou iets kost dan is dat gunstig voor jou en moet jij er voor gaan. Als jij iets kan pakken van de tegenstander dat een grotere waarde heeft dan de stuk/pion die jij er voor moet geven dan is dat ook gunstig. Kijk er echter tegerlijkertijd voor uit dat jijzelf geen van zulke kansen geeft voor de tegenstander.
Hopelijk heb ik tot nu toe niets gezegd dat helemaal nieuw voor jou is en ik denk dat jij bovenstaand al goed begrijpt. Toch zal je merken dat jij soms materiaal verliest terwijl jij dacht dat de tegenstander niets gratis kon pakken. Plotseling bedreigt één zet van de tegenstander meerdere stukken van jou en je kan niet voorkomen dat er iets genomen gaat worden. Dat is tactiek. Op zijn simpelst is tactiek een dubbelaanval. Er wordt met één zet meer bedreigt dan dat er met één zet verdedigt kan worden. Er zijn echter ook andere motieven waarmee materiaalwinst kan worden afgedwongen. Het is erg belangrijk in schaken om te herkennen wanneer jij een kans hebt om materiaalwinst af te dwingen door zulke tactische wendingen. Het is minstens zo belangrijk om te herkennen wanneer jijzelf kwetsbaar bent voor iets dergelijks."
293,8,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Bij de vorige zet zei ik dat e2-e4 leidt tot meer tactische stellingen. Daarmee bedoel ik dat je vaak posities op het bord krijgt waar tactische wendingen mogelijk zijn. Na bijvoorbeeld de volgende zetten:
1. e2-e4        e7-e5
2. Pg1-Pf3     Pc8-Pc6
3. Lf1-b5
De witte paard valt de pion op e5 aan en dus heeft zwart hem verdedigt met zijn paard. Als wit de pion nu zou nemen zou dat hem een paard kosten. Met zijn laatste zet valt wit echter de verdediger van de pion aan. Als zwart een zet zou passen kan wit de zwarte paard nemen met zijn loper en nadat zwart de loper terug neemt kan wit de pion op e5 alsnog nemen met zijn paard want de verdediger is weg. Deze tactische motief (het aanvallen/verwijderen van de verdediger) komt erg vaak voor en is zeker iets om op te letten.

Zwart speelt e7-e6 de Franse verdediging. Net als na e7-e5 maakt de pion de weg vrij voor de loper en dame doordat de pion zich echter een beetje inhoudt heeft zwart minder ruimte in de centrum. Dat kan het moeilijker maken om bepaalde stukken actief te maken. Daar tegenover staat dat wit minder zwaktes heeft om op te mikken. Er is geen hangende pion dat verdediging nodig heeft en het zwakke punt f7 is minder gemakkelijk om aan te vallen. Meestal wordt deze zet opgevolgd door d7-d5 zodat zwart alsnog een aandeel heeft in de centrum. In deze partij heeft zwart iets anders voor ogen."

De paard kan echter helaas niet bewegen omdat zijn eigen koning er achter staat. Situaties waarin stukken niet mogen bewegen omdat een lijn onderbroken moet blijven worden penningen genoemd. In dit geval is de paard het gepende stuk. Penningen worden gerekend tot de tactische motieven omdat het makkelijk is materiaal te verliezen in een dergelijke situatie. 
298,8,6,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"Zwart blijft zijn stukken snel naar buiten halen en is nu klaar voor rochade. Tevens valt de paard nu de pion op e4 aan. Op eerste gezicht lijkt het misschien dat deze pion verdedigt wordt door de paard op c3. Helaas is deze paard gepend en zal hij niet terug kunnen nemen op e4. Gepende stukken zijn slechte verdedigers!
Omdat de paard op c3 geen echte verdediger is kan de pion op e4 gratis genomen worden als wit hem niet verdedigt. Er moet dus een verdediger voor e4 gevonden worden. Helaas voor wit is dit nog redelijk lastig. Lf1-d3 dekt de pion op e4 maar blokkeert de verdediging die de dame geeft aan de pion op d4. Een ander idee is Lc1-d2. Hierna staat de paard op c3 niet meer gepend en heeft de e4-pion een echte verdediger. Helaas blokkeert dit wederom de verdediging van de d4-pion maar er is nog een probleem. Zelfs als de paard niet gepend zou staan kan zwart een pion winnen door eerst de paard te slaan met zijn loper (Lb4xc3). De verdediger wordt weer uitgeschakeld zodat de pion gratis kan worden genomen. Dd1-d3 dekt werkelijk alle pionnen en voor de moment hoeft wit geen materiaal te verliezen. Het is echter wel een beetje vernederend voor een machtige dame om kleine pionnetjes te moeten dekken. Ook kan een dame makkelijk worden weggejaagd van zijn verdediging vanwege zijn grote waarde. Ik zou hier waarschijnlijk e4-e5 gespeeld hebben."

De eerste fout van de partij. De gepende paard op c3 gaf geen dekking aan de pion op e4 en dus kan zwart hem nu gratis nemen. Beter was Dd1-d3 of e4-e5."
300,8,8,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bPPn3/2N5/PP1BBPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',"De positie wordt ingewikkelder en tactischer. Beide zijden moet goed opletten wat voor mogelijkheden de tegenstander heeft. Jij had waarschijnlijk gemerkt dat de paard gepend was en had daarom besloten om hem snel te bevrijden. De paard is nu niet meer gepend aan de koning. Ook geeft de loper nu extra dekking aan de paard op c3 die twee maal wordt aangevallen (door paard en loper). 
Daar staat tegenover dat de pion op d4 nu niet meer gedekt wordt door de dame. De hangende stuk op e4 is echter meer waard als de hangende pion op d4 en dus is dit geen probleem. Als zwart de pion op d4 neemt kan jij de paard op e4 nemen. Een paard is veel meer waard als twee pionnen en de materiaal voordeel zal jou de betere winstkansen geven.
Als zwart besluit eerst de paard af te ruilen kan jij terugnemen met de loper waarna de pion op d4 zijn verdediging terug krijgt. Dit zou desondanks een stuk beter zijn geweest. De extra pion die zwart in die variatie zou hebben gehad geeft hem een duidelijk voordeel."

303,8,11,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/8/2PnN3/8/PP1BBPPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',"?!
De zwarte loper stond aangevallen en dus moest er iets aan gedaan worden. Zwart besloot zijn loper terug te trekken maar hij had ook de optie om de loper af te ruilen op d2 of te verdedigen met bijvoorbeeld De8-e7. De beslissing is niet een makkelijke om te maken. Door de verlies van een paard staat zwart materiaal achter en dat lijkt te betekenen dat hij zoveel mogelijk materiaal op het bord moet houden terwijl wit zoveel mogelijk zou willen afruilen. Het verschil van dat ene paard wordt immers groter naarmate er minder materiaal op het bord staat. Volgens die principe deed zwart de juiste beslissing door de loper op het bord te houden. 
Zwart moet echter ook rekening houden met de aanvalsmogelijkheden van wit. Wit heeft nu meer actieve stukken als zwart en kan aardig wat druk zetten op de zwarte kamp. Door de activiteit van zijn stukken kan wit zelfs tactische mogelijkheden krijgen. Afruil zou in die opzicht misschien juist geweest zijn om een beetje druk uit de stelling te houden. Het kan erg lastig zijn om dergelijke conflicterende afwegingen tegen elkaar op te wegen. Ik vermoed dat afruil beter zou zijn geweest."

Een volgende tactische motief: de ontdekte aanval. Het vertrekken van de loper opent de aanval van de witte dame op de paard op d4. Ontdekte aanvallen kunnen erg sterk zijn omdat er zo makkelijk een dubbele dreiging kan worden opgezet. Als de loper een ongedekte pion/stuk zou aanvallen zouden er twee stukken/pionnen verdedigd moeten worden door de tegenstander. Helaas kan wit in dit geval geen goed gebruik maken van de ontdekte aanval want de zwarte paard is de enige voor de hand liggende doelwit.
-Vraagje 1 = Waarom zou Loper naar h6 niet werken? De loper zou een pion (g7) aanvallen die niet verdedigd is en de paard zou worden aangevallen door de dame.-
(Antwoorden op vragen aan de einde van de partij. Als je het liever niet wilt doen kan je natuurlijk direct naar het einde gaan om het antwoord te lezen.)
Wit heeft echter een andere tactische wapen beschikbaar door de activiteit van zijn stukken. Als wit op dit moment Ld2-c3 zou spelen zou zwart grote problemen hebben. De paard is zwaar onder vuur maar als hij vertrekt wordt er een lijn naar g7 geopent. Hij lijkt dus gepend te zijn aan de pion op g7. Maar wacht eens even zwart kan zijn paard op f5 zetten (Pd4-f5) en op die manier zowel pion als paard redden. Op dat moment komt echter een andere tactische motief naar voren. Als de zwarte paard op f5 staat is hij de enige verdediger van de pion op g7. Zulke verdedigers vallen wij aan. Na g7-g5 staat de zwarte paard aangevallen door een pion maar als hij vlucht kan de witte loper op c3 de pion op g7 slaan (Lc3xg7). Na Ld2-c3 wint wit een pion. 
De tactische mogelijkheden kwamen omdat de witte stukken actiever waren als die van zwart en omdat zwart hangend (onverdedigd) materiaal heeft."

In de partij speelde jij echter La5. De loperzet opende de aanval op de paard maar hier valt helaas makkelijk tegen te verdedigen. Na Pd4-c6 zou zwart zijn paard in veiligheid hebben gebracht en de loper aanvallen. Aangezien wit de loper moet verdedigen of terugtrekken heeft hij/zij onnodig tijd verloren. In de partij koos zwart echter voor b6. Hij krijgt voor zijn paard jouw loper maar rekent niet ver genoeg. Nadat jij de paard neemt valt jouw dame namelijk zijn pion op g7 aan. Zwart verliest dus onnodig een pion."

De juiste zet voor zwart zou de simpele Pd4-f5 zijn. De paard gaat weg uit de aanval verdedigt zijn pion op g7 en valt de loper op h6 aan. De loper zal moeten terugtrekken en heeft dus tijd verspild."

339,9,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Starting the sequence for a possible French an opening I hate playing against and score very low against.
340,9,2,Qe2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',While I do not exactly heed my own advice playing (I've never played this line either OTB or online) I am aiming for more comfortable positions. I've experiment with many different responses to the French none of which I've been very successful with; sometimes here I'll play 2. b3 a gambit line or just stick to traditional classical or tarrasch lines. The Chigorin defense has almost 2000 games in the world database (compared to 90000 with the book d4) it discourages the typical 2...d5 from black in the french since after the pawn exchange black's e-pawn is pinned and he must capture with the queen. Black's typical response is 2...c5 after which the games resemble closed sicilian positions a board position that I would be much more comfortable in typically avoiding open sicilians when I play 1.e4
341,9,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',My opponent however does not go for typical play c6 supports the d5 push as black would not forced to re-capture with the queen. This does hinder the queen-side development though and indeed black does not develop these pieces until move 14 with Ra7! The pieces are perfectly at home on these squares for almost the entirety of the game. 
342,9,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq d3',Since ...c6 is so unusual there are only 4 games with it played White won with d4 but I know I'm mostly on my own here. I open lines to develop my bishop and try to stake my claim in the center. 
343,9,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',And now we have an early deviation from the database which continued 4...de4 5. Qe4 Nf6 6. Qh4. With the text move e4 loses a defender and d5 loses an attacker. 
344,9,6,Nf3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I decided that I would continue developing e4 was still protected by the queen but if de4 Qe4 Nf6 came to pass I wanted a defender on d4. Little did I realize that white needs to heed black already.

347,9,9,Nd2,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/1b1Pp3/2N5/PPPNQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I decided to at least remove the pin on my knight.
348,9,10,Qh6,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1p2q/8/1b2N3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',I've scrapped by and managed to only lose a pawn my structure is still intact on the queenside which was a worry but I need to develop my bishop and castle. I was hoping the development of Black's queen and the under-development of his minor pieces would gain me some tempo but that is not the case.

497,14,27,2a3,b'4r3/p7/2p1rkpp/8/3p1pPP/PPbR1B2/2P2PK1/3R4 b - -',This was a waiting move as I don't have much to do in this position. It at least takes away the b4 square from the bishop but on the other hand makes the queenside pawns a bit more vulnerable.
498,14,28,2Rb8,b'1r6/p7/2p1rkpp/8/3p1pPP/PPbR1B2/2P2PK1/3R4 w - -',?! Black tries to exploit that but interestingly enough the GK computer now thinks he throws away his advantage.
499,14,29,2Rh1,b'1r6/p7/2p1rkpp/8/3p1pPP/PPbR1B2/2P2PK1/7R b - -',?! This move was to sustain an advance on the kingside. The computer thinks I would have been better off by sacrificing the exchange with 29.Rxd4 Bxd4 30.Rxd4 freeing up my position. It considers that position as equal (-0.09). I hadn't considered that for a second but it looks like an interesting line.

He's obviously planning some exchange sac which would get his king involved to try and promote the b pawn. But there doesn't seem to be any immediate tactical compensation for the exchange so it has to be a purely positional exchange sac. I decided to take the bait and see what Black had for the exchange. (By the way the computer considers this exchange sac sound.)"
511,14,41,4Kf3,b'8/2r5/6pp/p2k4/P2P1pPP/2b2K2/1p3P2/1R1R4 b - -',To my pleasure I saw I could finally get the king activated.
512,14,42,4Rf7,b'8/5r2/6pp/p2k4/P2P1pPP/2b2K2/1p3P2/1R1R4 w - -',This is inaccurate according to the computer. It says Black's advantage is now 0.32 points while after 48...g5 49.hxg5 hxg5 it would be 1.26 points. I think the rook would be better placed on d7 than on f7 because now it doesn't sustain the queenside advance and that's where the action is right now. I'm not quite sure though so if someone could explain what's going on in this position I'd be very interested.
513,14,43,4Ke2,b'8/5r2/6pp/p2k4/P2P1pPP/2b5/1p2KP2/1R1R4 b - -',The computer says this is inaccurate as well and wants to play 49.Rd3 Kc4 50.Rdd1 Rd7 51.d5 Rxd5 52.Rxd5 Kxd5 53.Kxf4.
514,14,44,4Kc4,b'8/5r2/6pp/p7/P1kP1pPP/2b5/1p2KP2/1R1R4 w - -',The computer even says this is a mistake considering 49...Rb7 50.Kd3 Bxd4 winning for Black. Now it gives Black an advantage of 0.57 points.
515,14,45,5d6,b'8/5r2/3P2pp/p7/P4pPP/1kb5/1p2KP2/1R1R4 b - -',But now it also evaluates the position as winning for Black while I didnn't even make an error in the last two moves. I suppose the computer couldn't see far enough to see 49...Kc4 was also winning and so came up with a line that would win a bit faster. I had calculated a line that would lead to a good ending for me at this point but obviously I missed a move...
516,14,46,Bb4,b'8/3r4/3P2pp/p7/Pb3pPP/3R4/1pk1KP2/3R4 w - -',! And this was what I missed. I only considered the immediate 53...b1=Q 54.Rxb1 Kxb1 55.Rxc3 leading to an extra pawn for me. I already expected there was something wrong with my analysis but I didn't know what.
517,14,47,5Kf3,b'8/3r4/3P2pp/p7/Pb3pPP/3R1K2/1pk2P2/3R4 b - -',It's over now though I'm still an exchange up. The rest is simple.
518,14,48,Bb4,b'8/8/6pp/p7/Pb3pPP/5K2/1pk2P2/7R w - -',The master is very patient and waits for the best moment to promote. After the immediate 56...b1=Q?! 57.Rxb1 Kxb1 he would have some technical difficulties due to the reduced number of pawns.
519,14,49,Bc1,b'8/8/6pp/p7/P3K1PP/8/1pk2P2/2b4R w - -',But now it's all over and I resign but I'm not unhappy at all with this game. I think I made a very good fight out of it and even came close to a draw. In the end the exchange sac which complicated the position made the difference. Congratulations for a wonderful game by my opponent who was the deserved winner. Please leave some comments. Thank you for reading hope you enjoyed it.

It quickly became a race for the kill. I don't mind trading away my black squared bishop as he may be bad if my pawns stay on the board. Otherwise he may be useful for an attack on the queenside.

I don't like this variation as after 5. Bb3 black can't follow up with the normal na5 due to the hanging pawn on e5. White has played Bxf7+ even but that's shaky at best.

If 7...exd4 then 8. e5 causes trouble. If 8...ne4 then 9. Bd5! Threatening nxd4 regaining the pawn with lots of threats. If instead 8...ng4 9. Re1 followed by h3 and black is struggling to hold on to everything. Better for black is the game continuation getting things developed and ignoring free pawns!

I think I would simplify with Bxc6 qxc6 d5 qd7 then I can head off the inevitable e4 with h3. The sacrifice Bxh3 is ok because I have nh2 holding everything together with two extra pieces. Black just goes for safety allowing me to keep my extra piece unbothered.
654,20,7,1d5,b'r4rk1/2pqbppp/p1np4/1p1Pp3/4B1b1/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',The reason for this closing move is mainly because the knight has no good square. After 12...nd8 the rooks are disconnected so c6 later is dangerous. After 12...na5 I have a nice choice between 13. nbd2 developing a new piece to meet the nc4 difficulty or instead 13. B3 both of which look comfortable.

If black can cause difficulty before they get out there is hope. I was expecting f4 for that very reason. After 17...f4 18. Bc1 (keeping d2 for the knight) f3! was one idea. After 19. gxf3 qxh3 black has hopes of perpetual check. However I don't have to take on f3 so I think I am still winning.

Lesson to be learnt here...even ahead material the first plan is always to develop your worst pieces. There's no point being ahead a piece if it sits at home.
669,20,22,2Nc3,b'r4rk1/2pq3p/p2b2p1/1p1Ppn2/2P2p2/2N2P1P/PPB1QBP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Bxc4 was an option but I think the knight is not that dangerous. By the time the forces are amassed black will need them back in the centre for defense!

786,26,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Strenghens the Pawnchain black has to search for the weakest link.However it opens the Diagonal that Blacks Bishop is going to use. :)
787,26,2,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQ -',White has completly disregarded development. However the Bishops already have some power onfolding  but both nices have no good place to go.
788,26,3,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/3P2B1/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQ -',Deconstruct the Chain and probably recapture with development. (If White does not capture it will either have an advanced pawn which will probably fall or White has to move the queen early)
789,26,4,exf6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1pp1/8/4P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQ -',I decided to recapture with the pawn because I was planning f5 because either I could develop with gain of tempi all other moves do not look that sound to me.
790,26,5,Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1pp1/8/4P3/2P2P2/PP1N2PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',?! White is terribly behind in development. The Knight on the second rank is not really well placed but it wouldn't be well placed on a3 either...
791,26,6,1Nc4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np2p1/5p2/2N1P3/2P2P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ -',? White wants to trade the e-Pawn for my isolated d-pawn I got no problem with that the Knight will be two far away from all the other pieces interplay will proof to be very difficult.
792,26,7,1Nxf3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2nN2p1/8/8/2P2N2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Black nearly lost his advantage in development but his position is still superior.

796,26,11,1Qc2,b'r1b3k1/pp2qpbp/2nr2p1/8/8/2P2N2/PPQ1B1PP/R4RK1 b - -',?? Qe1 is proably the only solution as Nd4 fails (15 Nd4 Nxd4 16 xd4 Rxd4/Bxd4+).
797,26,12,1Bf5,b'r5k1/pp2qpbp/2nr2p1/5b2/8/2P2N2/PPQ1B1PP/R4RK1 w - -',! Developing and hunting the sole defender of e2
798,26,13,1Rae1,b'r5k1/pp3pbp/2nr2p1/5b2/8/1QP2N2/PP2q1PP/4RRK1 b - -',? White could have taken the Pawn on b7 to get at least something...
799,26,14,Qb6+,b'r5k1/pp3pbp/1qnr2p1/5bN1/8/1QP5/PP4PP/4RRK1 w - -',Let's simplify
800,26,15,2Nh4,b'r5k1/1p3pb1/1pnr2pp/8/6bN/P1P5/1P4PP/4RRK1 b - -',?! But whereelse to go?

I was interested to find out later that Nf6 does indeed score better on the opening databases.
842,28,6,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/2p5/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"This was unexpected but I have seen it before. I remember an article in an old ""Chess"" magazine recommending this move. The idea is to later retreat the bishop to c2 and play d4 with a strong centre and to handle it a bit like a Spanish Opening or a Ruy Lopez as we English often call it."
843,28,7,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pp4/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',But this moves seems to me to cut across White's plans. If White exchanges on d5 it will be hard to force d4 and White is left with a backward d pawn. I was pleased to see on the opening databases after the game that this is indeed Black's best reply.
844,28,8,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2ppP3/8/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So he doesn't take but advances.

I looked at Bf5 with the idea of Bd3. The problem is that he has 9. Nd4 and then Bd3 is met with Qxg4. I also looked at 9. Nd4 Nxe5 10. Nxf5 Nd3+ but came to the conclusion that Black has not enough to justify the sacrifice. I was interested to find out later that there were a couple of over-the-board games with Bf5 9. Nd4 Bxb1 10. Qxg4 Bd3 when f4 was 0-1 in Davydov Sergey… (2249) vs. Weetik Vjaches… (2436) and e6 was 1-0 in  Moreda Lucas (2329) vs. Della Morte Pa… (2350)

Whichever he does it turns out the better to me. He can't capture d2 knight coz his queen is en-prise. And if he captures e4 knight with rock I recapture with knight leaving his queen en prise again forcing him to take it with bishop and then I'd be capturing his unguarded knight with a check. If he takes it with bishop the same outcome results if he recaptures with rock I lifted up the bishop threat on my a-rock and exploited the position with this move.

I would've been very content with a draw against such a strong player but now I'm glad it didn't end this way. After the text move I had to think on my own.
1030,31,4,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',!? The main move is 6.Bd3. However this move is the second most played move on the DB and it does prevent the normal ...c5 break. I was unaware of the theory at the time so just tried to develop.
1031,31,5,Ng4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPPn1/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',?! Played almost instantly as if he knew that this was the refutation of my previous move. Not knowing the theory I thought he knew what he was doing and came to the conclusion that 6.Be3!? was not so strong a move. But when I showed the game to someone at my club who plays the Pirc himself he said that this was too early. The normal moves here are 6...b6 and 6...Nc6.
1032,31,6,Bc1,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPPn1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',!? Not quite what I wanted to play but I thought it  was not a big problem because I can chase back the Knight with h3 and then put my bishop back on e3. I have then lost a tempo by playing h3 but maybe that's not a lost tempo after all as it does prepare a pawn storm on the kingside. Normal here is 7.Bg1.
1033,31,7,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/3PPPn1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ c6',And there we have it the usual Pirc break.
1034,31,8,Nh6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2pn/8/3NPP2/2N4P/PPP3P1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',?! A strange decision. This knight is very badly placed at h6 as we'll see later in the game. Maybe he thought my opening play was bad and tried to refute it but didn't think he'd refute it by just playing normal Pirc moves such as 9...Nf6. Or maybe he wanted to keep ...f5 as an option.
1035,31,9,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2pn/8/3NPP2/2N1B2P/PPPQ2P1/R3KB1R b KQ -',Setting up a battery. Now the threat is 12.f5 winning the knight which has no squares.

The immediate 12.f5!? is then answered by 12...Nxd4! 13.Bxd4 Bxd4 14.Qxd4 gxf5 but White still keeps a good position. The try to prepare it with 12.Nxc6?! bxc6 and then 13.f5 can now be answered by 13...Qb4! when 14.Bxh6? fails to 14...Qxb2!.
1037,31,11,Nf7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2pnbp/2np2p1/5p2/2BNPP2/2N1B2P/PPPQ2P1/R3K2R w KQ -',?! I don't like this move. Now Black will get very cramped. I think the normal 12...Kh8 would be better.
1038,31,12,1Bxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2pnbp/3p2p1/5P2/2BB1P2/2N4P/PPPQ2P1/R3K2R b KQ -',Probably even better is 14.fxg6!? hxg6 15.Bxd4. I missed this during the game.

1043,31,17,1Qd4+,b'2rq1r2/p2bpnkp/3p2p1/1p1B4/3Q1PP1/2N4P/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',Double attack from the queen. Also good is 19.Rhe1!? with a strong attack.
1044,31,18,Nxe5,b'2rq1r2/p2b2kp/3p2p1/1p1Bn3/3Q2P1/2N4P/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',I think 20...dxe5 is slightly better as the d pawn now remains vulnerable to attacks from the half-open d file. The pawn on e5 denises White the d4 square and is also somewhat easier to defend it seems.
1045,31,19,2Qxa7,b'2rq1r2/Q2b2kp/3p2p1/1p1Bn3/6P1/2N4P/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',Again 21.Rhe1 was worth considering. But now there's also the threat of 22.Nxb5.

The computer wants to play 22...b4!? sacrificing another pawn which apparently creates some counterplay. Here Black had more than an hour against some 40 minutes for me but from this moment on he started to think very deeply at every move.

1049,31,23,Qf8,b'2r2q1k/3b3p/3p2p1/1p1Bn3/4NrP1/7P/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',? This is or rather should have been the losing blunder. It drops another pawn. The only way to stay in the game was 25...Nc4 26.Bxc4 Rxe4.

1051,31,25,2Nf7+,b'5q1k/2rb1N1p/6p1/1p1Bn3/5rP1/7P/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b - -',"?? I have a tendency to overlook obvious things especially if I have calculated some moves ahead. This move is an example. I had already seen this when I played 25.Ne4. I thought: ""It's check and he can't take with the Queen as it's protected by the bishop he can't take with the knight or move his king as the rook is attacked so this move wins."" However I overlooked Black's obvious reply. A week before this game a very similar blunder (but in an materially equal position) cost me a full piece. Fortunately for me things are not so bad this time."
1052,31,26,Qxf7,b'7k/2rb1q1p/6p1/1p2n3/6P1/7P/PPPQ4/1K1R3R w - -',?? And now I'm winning again. The correct move was 28...Nxf7 when I can't win the knight: 29.Qf4 Rb7 30.Rhf1 Kg8. The position remains better for me (and I'd have had a time advantage of about 15 versus 10 minutes) but winning this would be far from simple.
1053,31,27,2Qd6,b'7k/2rb1q1p/3Q2p1/1p2n3/6P1/7P/PPP5/1K1R3R b - -',! It's all over now.
1054,31,28,2Qg7,b'7k/2rb2qp/3Q2p1/1p2n3/6P1/7P/PPP5/1K1R3R w - -',!? Objectively a blunder but Black is trying one last trick...
1055,31,29,Nc4,b'7k/2Qb2qp/6p1/1p6/2n3P1/7P/PPP5/1K1R3R w - -',Now I have to be careful. Black threatens mate and there are two wasys to avoid this of which one is correct. 31.c3?? loses to 31...Bf5+! 32.gxf5 Qxc7. But I make the correct move.
1056,31,30,3Qb8+,b'1Q5k/3b2qp/6p1/1p6/2n3P1/7P/PPP5/1K1R3R b - -',Actually 31.Qd8+ was mate in 10 but this is more than enough for the win. Black can only interpose with his queen (or with his bishop but that doesn't make any sense at all) after which I trade queens and take the bishop leaving black a rook and an exchange down. Black resigned here as there's no hope left and I got my first victory over a 1700 player. Next Tuesday the second round will be played. I'm the only one of the lower-rated half who has won the first round so I'll probably have a very strong opponent. Let's see what the next game will bring.
1057,32,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a line I saw analysed by a GM once. It is a positional trap because the temptation is to play  3...d4?! 4 ne2 (threatening d4) and now 4...d3 5. ng3 is great for white (he has the strong knight on g3 but still has his key e4 pawn whereas black has the awkward pawn on c6) or worse still 4...c5 5. c3 and black won't be able to hold on to those central pawns because of the Qa4+ check. Either way white gets a strong centre and easier development. The correct move for white is either dxe4 which leads to normal Caro-Kann stuff or the game continuation which is more interesting!
1058,32,1,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now the plan for white is to keep the light-squared bishop from the queenside and create some weaknesses there. Not really what happens in the game but still...
1059,32,2,d4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/6b1/3p4/3P2P1/2N2N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',I wasn't sure about this move. I have played 7. Bb5+ before in an OTB game but after 7...nc6 8. ne5 rc8 I was unclear of how to exploit black's development problems. I played this against a WIM in a tournament once and eventually got beaten with a tactic. I tried 7. d4 this time as Be4 is no real threat and maybe I can be more flexible in responding to black's attempts to develop. I was expecting something like 7...h5 or 7...nf6 here because black's main problem is developing the kingside. I can't see any major problems with the game continuation but it did allow me some weaknesses to work with.
1060,32,3,Bb5,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n3b1/1B1p4/3P2P1/2N2N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Following my opening play this is the only consistent way to proceed. I want to isolate a pawn on c6 if possible and dominate the game with ne5.
1061,32,4,1Ne5,b'r2qkbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/3P2P1/2N4P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',As planned. Now it's harder than it looks to defend c6. There are ideas like qf3 floating about whereupon I can think about the sacrifice on c6 or the pawn storm starting with h4. 
1062,32,5,1Qc8,b'r1q1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/3P2P1/2N4P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I've requested computer analysis but I would bet that this is a mistake. It gives me a tempo after na4. It serves a nice purpose of defending c6 while attacking a key diagonal (if ...h5 at some point I have to be careful) and it avoids the danger of Bf4 for the moment. In fact it demonstrates how c6 is more difficult to defend than would first appear.
1063,32,6,1Na4,b'r1q1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/N2P2P1/7P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This move is justified I think even if it is unrealistic to expect to have the knights on e5 and c5 for long enough to do damage. The tempo I gain with the threat of nb6 is good and there aren't many safe squares for those major pieces. Still black hasn't got his kingside developed at all...good news for me.
1064,32,7,1Bf4,b'1rq1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/N2P1BP1/7P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R b KQk -',12. nc5 was also a contender of course. I thought the best response would be e6 whereupon I have a number of options. I considered  ncd7 rook somewhere then nxf8 to take away black's castling rights...but decided that black might be safer with the king in the centre (I have no pawn break really whereas he has h5 to release his rook). I wasn't sure how best to exploit the positional advantage I have so decided upon Bf5. It makes the rook uncomfortable (although I'm not sure whether it's forced to move immediately or not) develops an important piece while b2 is still protected and gives me another defender on the kingside which could open up at any time with h5.
1065,32,8,1Rb4,b'2q1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/Nr1P1BP1/7P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R w KQk -',This must be a mistake. It allows the very natural move c3 for me which solidifies my centre protects the knight and makes the rook move (again).
1066,32,9,1c3,b'2q1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/3pN3/Nr1P1BP1/2P4P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQk -',Of course. There was never any other contender to this all purpose move.
1067,32,10,1Qe2,b'2q1kbnr/4pppp/p1p3b1/1r1pN3/N2P1BP1/2P4P/PP2QP2/R3K2R b KQk -',I first noted that the rook has very few safe squares. I considered the sequence 14. b4 followed by nc5 and a4 to get things rolling. I think it would have been ok but I would constantly have to calculate what happens after ...h5 to see whether I would have to spend time defending myself. My concern was that black would develop (kicking my knight out first) and then have rook and queen on an open file (after a5) which would force me to castle short and then h5 would be strong. I decided to wait with qe2 which protects b2 (allowing the knight to move) and discourages any weakening of the central pawns. With the king so tied up in the centre there may be some sacrificial opportunities. Note that in the absence of the queen the back rank mate is possible in some (rather weird) lines.
1068,32,11,1e6,b'2q1kbnr/5ppp/p1p1p1b1/1r1pN3/N2P1BP1/2P4P/PP2QP2/R3K2R w KQk -',This had to come I suppose. It helps black develop but also weakens his counterplay against the g4 square and makes my game considerably more solid.
1069,32,12,1h4,b'2q1kbnr/5ppp/p1p1p1b1/1r1pN3/N2P1BPP/2P5/PP2QP2/R3K2R b KQk -',So I jumped on the opportunity to try to embarass the black king. Of course if 15...h6 then Bxg6 fxg6 and black has a long-term weakness in front of an uncastled king. It should be a quick game after that. I don't know what the computer says (yet) but f6 is probably a necessary move.
1070,32,13,1f6,b'2q1kbnr/6pp/p1p1ppb1/1r1pN3/N2P1BPP/2P5/PP2QP2/R3K2R w KQk -',I thought about this for quite a while. I figured that if Nf3 then Be4 and I will have to defend for a while with one knight out of the game. If nd3 then Bxd3 and I still have a good game but again I'll spend time getting the other knight back in the game and black's kingside is relatively unharmed. The game continuation gives me a few weaknesses to work with and so I calculated both pawn advances and noticed that there was an interesting positional way to play against the B on f8.
1071,32,14,1g5,b'2q1kbnr/6p1/p1p1ppp1/1r1p2P1/N2P1B1P/2P5/PP2QP2/R3K2R b KQk -',This was the point. After fxg5 Bxg5 Be7 I can play Bxe7 and then after nxe7 my knight comes to c5 and will be unstoppable. The e5 pawn will have to fall. If kxe7 instead I castle and nc5 is just as good.
1072,32,15,1O-O-O,b'2q1k1nr/4b1p1/p1p1ppp1/1r1p2P1/N2P1B1P/2P5/PP2QP2/2KR3R b k -',Same idea as expressed in the last note. Black needs his dark-squared bishop for the g5 area and for the knight if it comes to c5.
1073,32,16,1Kf7,b'2q3nr/4bkp1/p1p1ppp1/1r1p2P1/N2P1B1P/2P5/PP2QP2/2KR3R w - -',This is one of those moves that rings alarm bells. My first instinct was rde1 and then try to distract the queen from e5. But how? Then I noticed a way to build the pressure on g6 instead as a way of breaking through.
1074,32,17,1h5,b'2q3nr/4bkp1/p1p1ppp1/1r1p2PP/N2P1B2/2P5/PP2QP2/2KR3R b - -',"I like this move! Again no computer analysis yet but I calculated a few possibilities: 19...fxg5? hxg6+ and the rook falls.
19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 (forced) 21. qxh5+ and then ...g6 22. qh7+  kf8 leads to a strong position. I think I can probably win by bringing the knight in with 23. nc5 If he takes it with the bishop then Bd6 will be too strong a weakness. I can also bring the rook to the h-file and up to h7 in true Fischer style! Note that Qb7 is never enough of a threat for him as I have b3 to hold the attack off for a while.
19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 21. qxh5+ kf8 and I'm doing very well indeed. I don't know how best to continue (probably g6) but there are lots of mating ideas in this and it's hard to bring the pieces back to the defense of the kingside quickly. I didn't calculate this to the end by any means but I was confident that either continuation was favourable to white."

I would have carried on for a while but then being in the driving seat I wasn't forced to calculate all the possible defensive lines.

Anyway a nice game I think...hope you do too."

This was a popular opening back in time and many great master used to play this aggressive opening. It could be stated as matter of honor to accept the gambit pawn.

I agree that this the best move by black. Declining the gambit usually lets white to keep atleast a small advantage in my opinion quite easily.

It seems that black wants to hold his f-pawn by playing move 3...h6 and same idea can be seen in some other KG variations(in Becker black just doesn't need to keep the same weaknesses). White usually decides to play move like h4 to undermine blacks pawn chain on kingside.

If you want to vary with your opening then you should give some time analysing 4.b3 aswell.

I simply saw that this move forces black to take and I can bring check on c5 now without queen blocking it forcing black king to move on same time and restricting movement of his army. It was also clear that if king moves to d8 after the check that I could use my pawns to win material.
