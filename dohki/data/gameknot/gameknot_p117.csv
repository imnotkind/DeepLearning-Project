1,0,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',1...c5. The Sicilian. I am not secure in the Sicilian but I decided to play along with what I knew and throw some curves.
2,0,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2...d6. Standard book I believe. Is this a Closed Sicilian?
3,0,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I try to open. This is actually a gambit as you will soon see. I will sacrifice this pawn for a development and doubled d-pawns.
4,0,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Protecting and developing.
5,0,5,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Attacking. Building pressure.
6,0,6,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq e6',Now Black has three pawns and a minor in the center versus my one pawn and two minors. Black is cramped and underdeveloped. White can castle and continue developing. Perhaps get the Dark Squared Bishop to a3 where it can peek into Black's base.
7,0,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Attacking the vulnerable e4 pawn. Nbd2 solves this problem and develops. It can be argued that it would be a bad move since it blocks in the Dark Bishop and that may very well be why I played Ng5 but if White wants to put the Bishop on a3 then Nbd2 is best.
8,0,8,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',7.Ng5. Defends the e4-pawn and puts more pressure on the f7 pawn getting ready to fork on f7.
9,0,9,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',7....d5! This move undoubles Black's pawns opens the center attacks the Bishop and the e4-pawn and opens the a3-f8 diagonal for Black's Dark Bishop. 
10,0,10,Bxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3Bp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"9.Bxd5!?. I think that here the continuation 9.Qf3 f6 10.Qxd5 Qxd5 11.Bxd5 fxg5 12.Bxc6+ bxc6 13.cxd4 exd4 14.Re1+ Be7 15. Bxg5 leaves White ahead even though material is even. 
"
11,0,11,Qxd5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3qp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',When the dust settles White is down by one and Black dominates the center. White's only pro in this situation is that he is castled.
12,0,12,1Re1,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3qp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Hitting/pinning the e5-pawn and putting indirect pressure on the King.
13,0,13,1h6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3pp1/2n4p/3qp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Booting the Knight to preferable f3 where he can add pressure to the center.
14,0,14,Bg4,b'r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Pinning and developing. Black can now castle. White needs to force Black's hand to keep his King in the middle.
15,0,15,1Nbd2,b'r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',12.Nbd3? This should have been done five moves ago. This move is too passive. Even h3 is more useful stopping Black from castling.
16,0,16,1Be7,b'r3k2r/pp2bpp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Black is fully developed almost and White still has a minor and his Queen on the back rank.

19,0,19,1Qd7,b'r3k2r/pp1qbpp1/2n4p/4p2b/3p4/1QP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1B1R1K1 w kq -',And the final needed defender is removed. e5 will fall.
20,0,20,1Rxe5,b'r3k2r/pp1qbpp1/7p/4R2b/3p4/1QP4P/PP1N1PP1/R1B3K1 b kq -',Now White has a ironfisted grip on the center with a Rook in the center and the Knight ready to move to e4. But White isn't dead quite yet. Not until he overlooks Rxh5.
21,0,21,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1qbpp1/7p/7R/8/1QPp3P/PP1N1PP1/R1B3K1 w - -',17....O-O. Nope. Too little too late. The Queen and d3-pawn can be forked and Black has castled into a trap.
22,0,22,1Rd5,b'r4rk1/pp1qbpp1/7p/3R4/8/1QPp3P/PP1N1PP1/R1B3K1 b - -',Forking the Queen and pawn.

25,0,25,2Nf1,b'r4rk1/1pq1bpp1/7p/p7/8/1QPR3P/PP3PP1/R1B2NK1 b - -',20.Nf1. This move proves to be White's saving grace on move 24.
26,0,26,b5,b'1r3rk1/2q1bpp1/7p/pp6/3R4/1QP4P/PP3PP1/R1B2NK1 w - b6',21....b5. More waste.
27,0,27,2Rg4,b'1r3rk1/2q1bpp1/7p/pp6/6R1/1QP4P/PP3PP1/R1B2NK1 b - -',The King is feeling the heat now.

29,0,29,Rbd8,b'3r1rk1/2q1bpp1/7p/1p1Q4/p5R1/2P4P/PP3PP1/R1B2NK1 w - -',If not for 20.Nf1 the White Queen would be lost for Rd1 would be mate.
30,0,30,2Qh5,b'3r1rk1/2q1bpp1/7p/1p5Q/p5R1/2P4P/PP3PP1/R1B2NK1 b - -',Three pieces --Rook Queen and Dark Bishop -- bear down on Black's King.
31,0,31,2Qxh6,b'5rk1/2q1bpp1/7Q/1p6/p5R1/2P4P/PP3PP1/R1Br1NK1 b - -',This is better than taking with the Bishop.

38,0,38,3h5,b'4r1k1/2q2p2/6pQ/1p4RP/p7/2P5/PP3PP1/R4K2 b - -',30.h5. Finally he reaches h5. Now Black's King's safe haven is no longer safe.
39,0,39,3Re6,b'6k1/2q2p2/4r1pQ/1p4RP/p7/2P5/PP3PP1/R4K2 w - -',30....Re6 stares down my Queen.

42,0,42,Qg7,b'6k1/6q1/4rpPQ/1p5R/p7/2P5/PP3PP1/R4K2 w - -',32....Qg7 doesn't help much. Only takes out White Queen and traps the King in the corner.
43,0,43,3Qh7+,b'6k1/6qQ/4rpP1/1p5R/p7/2P5/PP3PP1/R4K2 b - -',32.Qh7+! This trades off Queens and puts Black's King in a tough spot.

45,0,45,3Kh8,b'7k/7P/4rp2/1p5R/p7/2P5/PP3PP1/R4K2 w - -',34....Kh8 is the only viable option. It will now be stuck there until the Rook can come to aid.

Noticing this I spent a minute calculating an interesting pawn sacrifice that might not necessarily leave me with excellent compensation but would require my opponent to make calculated defensive moves which is what I needed having the time advantage.

I had already calculated up to this point from 18. c4 so I had been spewing moves out while my opponent was taking time to think about them. My opponent's time was already running quite thin (at least under a minute) and with this move he would certainly have to take another chunk of time to think of a proper defense.
184,6,25,2Nd5,b'2r1r1k1/1b3ppp/p7/3n1N2/2p2B2/5P2/1P4PP/2RR2K1 w - -',Good move prolong Nd6 due to attack on the bishop. However he spent another good amount of time on this move as I intended.

However my opponent now had mere seconds so all I had to do was play it out until time either caused him to blunder or cost him the game.
187,6,28,2Nd6,b'2rr2k1/1b3ppp/p2N4/3n4/2p5/5PB1/1P4PP/2RR2K1 b - -',Playing it anyway and now I will at least regain the pawn I sacrificed. After this move my opponent exhausted what little time he had and lost so I plugged the position into Houdini. Best play line that was given went: 24...Rc7 25 Nxc4 25...Rcd7 26. Ne5 and white came out with a slight advantage (around 0.25 of a point for you numbers people). In this game I hope I showed that if a position seems dead drawn to you look for other factors to play off of and in blitz games or a tournament setting the clock can be a huge factor. When one has the time advantage he should take the time to calculate complicated (but not losing) lines where his opponent will have to think hard to create a defense while you calmly move your pieces right after his.

224,9,1,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Not my favored response to the Sicilian but definitely playable.  There are a number of good lines from this position which offer exciting play.
225,9,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',To give natural development for my bishop and allow for an eventual center push.
226,9,3,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I was expecting g3 or bringing out one of the knights.  This pawn structure is one that certainly seeks to control the center but I don't like giving potential homes to knights by creating a vacuum on both sides.  If I can get a knight to d4 (and keep him there) he will be powerful.
227,9,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',All natural development for black so far.

230,9,7,Qe2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',This seems like a more natural play since it brings another piece into the game and doesn't abandon the c4 pawn to itself.  Also since white is probably looking to fianchetto his bishop on g2 this protective move will offer more playable options for white.  I think the queen move was the better of the two choices.
231,9,8,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/2p1P3/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',And now white has to take since it is 3 against 2.

However I believe that white's priority should have been castling before thinking that far ahead.  Better to protect your king while you can.  Since my king is already castled I can start probing white's defenses for weakness and go on attacks of my own.  wmaes is a very good player so perhaps he has something up his sleeve?
235,9,12,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p1N3/2P5/3P2P1/PP1BQP1P/RN2KB1R b KQ -',I believe that this move was a mistake for the sequence that is about to unfold.  I expected Bg2 in preparation for a castle but now things are about to get ugly.

However as soon as this move was made I saw a possible way to get white to lose his castle.  My hand was forced to take on c3.
238,9,15,Nd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2Pn4/2NP2P1/PP2QP1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',Now the power play I am attacking white's queen but also threatening Nc2+!  Also note that white made this powerful position possible with the early pawn structure he chose.
239,9,16,1Qd1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2Pn4/2NP2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ -',The only play...

241,9,18,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pq2/2p5/2PnN3/3P2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Attack!  Or is it?

245,9,22,1Ke1,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4p3/2p5/2PnN3/3P2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R b - -',I'm not certain about the utility of this move.  Although white has lost his castle he still has piece parity so now I would have moved Bg2 (still!) to continue development then all of his pieces on the back rank are supporting each other.
246,9,23,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2q1pp/4p3/2p2p2/2PnN3/3P2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R w - f6',No good options for white's knight except to retreat.

248,9,25,1b6,b'r1b2rk1/p3q1pp/1p2p3/2p2p2/2Pn4/3P2P1/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R w - -',supporting my c pawn and giving a place for my bishop to develop upon namely b7.

255,9,32,2Kf1,b'4rrk1/pq4pp/1p6/2p1pp2/2Pn4/3P1PP1/PP1N3P/R2Q1KR1 b - -',I think Kf2 is better here providing support for his g1 rook and giving some extra defense for his f3 pawn.
256,9,33,2e4,b'4rrk1/pq4pp/1p6/2p2p2/2Pnp3/3P1PP1/PP1N3P/R2Q1KR1 w - -',Decision time for white.  There is a lot of power projecting into his king's turf and there are a couple of possible responses.  My expectation was dxe4 or f4.  I also wondered if white might try Nxe4.  dxe4 would be followed by fxe4+ and f4 would be followed by e3! likely winning the knight and opening a hole for a rook to wade in supported by a knight.  When your king is being pressured it is best to avoid open lines of attack.
257,9,34,2fxe4,b'4rrk1/pq4pp/1p6/2p2p2/2PnP3/3P2P1/PP1N3P/R2Q1KR1 b - -',color me surprised!  This is the one move I didn't expect white to make.  However the response is a given.
258,9,35,2fxe4+,b'4rrk1/pq4pp/1p6/2p5/2Pnp3/3P2P1/PP1N3P/R2Q1KR1 w - -',"Now no matter which way white goes he is in for some pain.  White resigned here.  

The main lessons from the game I believe are instructive: look to castle before going aggressive; and when your opponent has already castled and you have not s/he will go on the offensive so quickly develop pieces that will help you castle so you can have a measure of safety.  I hope you enjoyed the annotation."
259,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my preferred opening move for White since it opens up diagonals for my Queen and King's Bishop while staking a claim on the centre with the pawn.

261,10,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Not taking the d-pawn would allow Black to advance it further reducing the space white has control of.

263,10,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Since I hadn't seen this opening before I had to think awhile before coming up with this answer. I was willing to give up the d5 pawn but since it hasn't been taken yet I decided to make use of it to grab as much space as possible. I initially thought of 3. Nc3 but after 3. ... Nxd6 4. Nxd6 Qxd6 Black's queen has control of the centre and White has no options left to chase it away.
264,10,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I was later to learn that this opening is the Scandinavian gambit.

284,10,25,1Bc5,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2nq1b1p/2Bp4/4B3/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',I decided to push around Black's queen even more although I'm not sure if this was my best move. Perhaps I should have just taken the pawn immediately.
285,10,26,1Rxd5,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1q1pp1/2n2b1p/2BR4/4B3/5N2/PPQ2PPP/5RK1 b - -',17. Bxd5 might have been safer but I wanted to keep my bishop along the b1-h7 diagonal.
286,10,27,1Qe6,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2n1qb1p/2BR4/4B3/5N2/PPQ2PPP/5RK1 w - -',Now my bishop at e4 is in danger and Black's queen is attacking my rook at d5 as well.
287,10,28,1Bh7+,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3ppB/2n1qb1p/2BR4/8/5N2/PPQ2PPP/5RK1 b - -',The only way I could see to save both pieces.
288,10,29,1Rfd1,b'r1b1r2k/pp3ppB/2n1qb1p/2BR4/8/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',I didn't want to retreat so I moved my other rook to form a battery. However this opens the possibility of a backdoor mate later on which would give me a lot of trouble.
289,10,30,1Bd4,b'r1b1r2k/pp3ppB/2n1q2p/2BR4/3b4/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Certainly not what I was expecting! This move cuts off mutual protection between my rooks so that my rook at d5 is in danger again. Because of the Qe1+ threat I cannot take Black's bishop with my knight or the rook at d1. If I go with 20. R5xd4 then after ... Nxd4 21. Bxd4 Rd8 White's pieces would be locked in defence.
290,10,31,2Bxd4,b'r1b1r2k/pp3ppB/2n1q2p/3R4/3B4/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',My rook at d5 is still safe from ... Qxd5 due to 21. Bxg7+ Kxg7 22. Rxd5. Also now White is temporarily leading in material.
291,10,32,2Nb4,b'r1b1r2k/pp3ppB/4q2p/3R4/1n1B4/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Looks like Black really wants to trade his knight and bishop for my rook. However I have other plans...
292,10,33,2Bxg7+,b'r1b1r2k/pp3pBB/4q2p/3R4/1n6/5N2/PPQ2PPP/3R2K1 b - -',With this move Black's king is forced into the open. I have no qualms about 'sacrificing' a bishop that was given to me for free in the first place.
293,10,34,2Qc3+,b'r1b1r3/pp3pkB/4q2p/3R4/1n6/2Q2N2/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Gets my queen out of the knight fork and counter-forks Black's king and knight. Furthermore there's the added benefit of protecting the e1 square.
294,10,35,b6,b'r1b1r3/p4p1k/1p2q2p/3R4/1Q6/5N2/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Here Black is thinking of developing his remaining bishop to b7 and planning on exchanging it with White's knight in order to blow the g file open.
295,10,36,2Ng5+,b'r1b1r3/p4p1k/1p2q2p/3R2N1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',This was my answer. Black is practically forced to take the knight because knight forks can't be defended against.
296,10,37,2Rxg5,b'r1b1r3/p4p1k/1p2q3/6R1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Black's king is suddenly in danger from 26. Qh4+ Qh6 27. Rh5.
297,10,38,2Qh6,b'r1b1r3/p4p1k/1p5q/6R1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',The only response Black can make. Any other response leads to exchanging his queen for White's rook.
298,10,39,2Rdd5,b'r1b1r3/p4p1k/1p5q/3R2R1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/6K1 b - -',Now that Black's queen no longer threatens e1 it frees up my other rook to be more aggressive. Here White is clearly threatening Rh5 and pinning Black's queen to the king.
299,10,40,2a5,b'r1b1r3/5p1k/1p5q/p2R2R1/1Q6/8/PP3PPP/6K1 w - a6',I didn't see the point of this move as it allowed me to reposition my queen. Later my friend said that he wanted to remove my queen's influence from the f8 square. However I don't think that would have been a problem since my rook at g5 was already preventing his king from reaching f8. A better response might have been 26. ... f5 (separating my rooks again) 27. f4 (planning g4 then Rh5) Rg8.
300,10,41,2Qd2,b'r1b1r3/5p1k/1p5q/p2R2R1/8/8/PP1Q1PPP/6K1 b - -',I only had 2 choices: Qc3 or Qd2 since my queen still has to defend the e1 square. I went with Qd2 since it would link my queen with my rooks. Now 28. Rh5 would be even more costly for Black with 28. ... Qxh5 29. Rxh5+ Kg7 (or Kg8) 30. Qg5+ Kf8 31. Rh8#
301,10,42,2Bg4,b'r3r3/5p1k/1p5q/p2R2R1/6b1/8/PP1Q1PPP/6K1 w - -',"I saw this possibility a few moves earlier. This move defends the h5 square thereby preventing White from moving Rh5. Also White cannot simply take Black's bishop with 28. Rxg4 because of ... Qxd2. White cannot retake the queen because e1 is no longer defended and therefore must play 29. Rh5+ Qh6 30. Rxh6+ Kxh6 31. f4. After this exchange White would be down by a rook.

However I disregarded 27. ... Bg4 as a viable way to defend because of the following move..."
302,10,43,2h3,b'r3r3/5p1k/1p5q/p2R2R1/6b1/7P/PP1Q1PP1/6K1 b - -',h3 attacks Black's bishop while simultaneously opening an escape route for White's king (finally! whew.) Later my opponent would admit that when he played 27. ... Bg4 he was thinking of 28. h3 Bh5 29. g4 Bg6. However it wasn't until he moved the bishop that he saw 29. Rxh5.
303,10,44,2Qe6,b'r3r3/5p1k/1p2q3/p2R2R1/6b1/7P/PP1Q1PP1/6K1 w - -',Black decides to force a queen exchange by checking at e1.javascript:void(0)
304,10,45,2Rxg4,b'r3r3/5p1k/1p2q3/p2R4/6R1/7P/PP1Q1PP1/6K1 b - -',I was thinking of Rh5.
305,10,46,2Qe1+,b'r3r3/5p1k/1p6/p2R4/6R1/7P/PP1Q1PP1/4q1K1 w - -',I have 2 choices again. First option: 30. Kh2 Qxd2 31. Rxd2. Second option: 30. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 31. Kh2. I went with the first option since I didn't want Black's rook running amok on the first rank but on hindsight the second option might have been better with a forced rook exchange after 31. ... Re6 32. Rh5+ Rh6 33. Rxh6+ Kxh6 or 31. ... Kh6 32. Kg3 f6 33. Kh4 Re5 34. Rxe5 fxe5.
306,10,47,3Rd5,b'r7/5p1k/1p2r3/p2R4/6R1/7P/PP3PPK/8 b - -',Getting ready to bring my king out and force an exchange.
307,10,48,Rg6,b'r7/5p2/1p4rk/p2R4/6R1/6KP/PP3PP1/8 w - -',Looks like Black gave up his fighting spirit.
308,10,49,3Rd6,b'r7/8/1p1R2pk/p7/8/6KP/PP3PP1/8 b - -',Attacking Black's b-pawn and pinning his g-pawn.
309,10,50,a4,b'r7/8/3R2pk/1p6/p4P2/6KP/PP4P1/8 w - -',A waiting move? Maybe Black hopes to break through and create a passed pawn on the queenside but it's too late.
310,10,51,3Rxg6+,b'6r1/8/6Rk/1p3P2/p7/6KP/PP4P1/8 b - -',Now Black is forced to exchange his remaining rook.
311,10,52,4Kd4,b'8/8/4k3/1p6/p2K4/7P/PP4P1/8 b - -',Black resigned here because there is no way to protect his a and b pawns while preventing White from promoting the g and h pawns.
312,11,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am starting with d4. I like that kind of games. 
313,11,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nf6 the most popular move.
314,11,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',c4 follows. I do not like Nf3 right now.
315,11,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And g6 the second most popular after e6. As black i play e6.
316,11,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Nc3 is logical. And now we will play the Kings Indian Defence or the Gruenfeld Defence.
317,11,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And here is the Kings Indian Defence an open that i dont like that much playing against it.
318,11,6,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',e4 continuing the main line.
319,11,7,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',And then c5. That not usual reply here and i was quite surprised as i found it unexpected. Here d6 or 0-0 were the main replies.
320,11,8,d5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So my d5 here is logical. What do you think?
321,11,9,d6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So d6 here.
322,11,10,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 is the best move here continuing the delopment.
323,11,11,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Another unexpected move here i think. Maybe better was 0-0.
324,11,12,Be2,b'rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Be2 is a fine move unpinning the queen too.
325,11,13,Qb6,b'rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',And Qb6 gets us out any theory i guess (according to my knowledge).
326,11,14,O-O,b'rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',0-0 is fine here maybe Qc2 or Bf4 would be fine too.

328,11,16,Na4,b'r3k2r/pp1nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/N1P1P1b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Maybe that was a blunder i do not know what do you think? Qc2 may be better or Bg5??

345,11,33,1b6,b'r3r1k1/2qnppb1/pp1p1np1/2pP3p/2P1PP2/2NB3P/PP1B2P1/R2QR1K1 w - -',b6 is silly and waste of time. He loses tempo without a reason. Maybe e6 is better what do you think?
346,11,34,1Qf3,b'r3r1k1/2qnppb1/pp1p1np1/2pP3p/2P1PP2/2NB1Q1P/PP1B2P1/R3R1K1 b - -',Good move.

352,11,40,2Nb5,b'r3r1k1/2qn1pb1/1p1p1np1/pNpPp2p/2P1PP2/3B1Q1P/PP1BR1P1/4R1K1 b - -',So Nb5 finishes the first part. The only move is Qb8 an it will be really outplaced there. Any another reply loses the d6 pawn and then the whole centre collapses.

My opponent said in PM that he hoped for de where he plays Bb2 but I demonstrated that this is still winning for white even if white decides to give the rook for bishop as white is left with two pieces for a rook and the bishop pair in that.   I opted for Rxc5 which I thought was easier to deal with (less calculation) objectively it is worse than the other line but not much.

Round 2 of a 4 round tournament in Skokie IL (two rounds per day).  This was preparation for my run in the U1700 of the Chicago Open 2012. Probably one of my worst tournaments ever.
457,15,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I used to play the Tartakower QGD lines after 1...d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 with the idea of castling short and playing h6 Nbd7 b6 and c5 at some moment to strike at the center.  I am now looking at the theory of the benoni and the nimzo indian defense.

I know a bunch of theory in the central set up systems for white with Nf3 h3 e4 and Bd3 where black gets the theoretical trick of ...b5! to complicate matters and hope for dynanmic counterchances.  I also don't mind the fianchetto systems.
460,15,4,Nh5,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP3n/5B2/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Perhaps a little early but the idea is simple: Bf4 hits the weak d6 point in black's camp and with the f3 knight coming to c4 to intensify the pressure black must sooner or later push away the threats to get play on the QS

In some lines h3 is a good idea to keep the bishop or knight (though the knight is on h5 now not f6) from hopping into g4.  However here I think for an advantage a5 was needed to clamp down on the black queenside
465,15,9,b5,b'1rb1r1k1/3nqpbp/p2p2p1/1ppP3n/P1N5/2N1B1PP/1P2PPB1/R2Q1RK1 w - b6',Fine play.  Also good was Ne5 looking for repetition where white has few better options than to either trade knights or accept the repetition.  Black's tactic of Nxg3 is in the air although I never had time to execute it.
466,15,10,Bb7,b'1r2r1k1/1b1nqpbp/3p2p1/NppP3n/8/2N1B1PP/1P2PPB1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A panic move. The engine recommends Qf8 to reserve the threat of Nxg3.  Black should be fine because of dynamics here although it looks scary.  Giving the exchange is better than allowing the d pawn to becoming a c6 passer. 
467,15,11,Ne5,b'1r2r1k1/4qpbp/2Pp2p1/1pp1n2n/8/2N1B1PP/1P2PPB1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? Nb6 was needed to keep the white knight out of the d5 whole when black is holding on just fine

Rather it looks like black is worse for sure being down the exchange but he looks forward to a QS majority as compensation and he should win back the c pawn of white.  I think maybe there are some practical saving chances left though the computer disagrees.

I don't guarantee the quality of the moves in the following lines then! Theorists are welcomed to pitiless destroy my attempts to explore myself some well-known lines probably choosing the wrong way. I'm only enjoying myself. 

Now black can try to cash in with 9... Bxc3+ 10. Bd2 (just guessing no books)  BxRa1 (saying that he's greedy) 11. Qxd1 (this threatens the Rh8 - wow so I guess black's best option is 0-0. Now it's white's turn to cash in with 12. dxNc6. 

fen=""r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2P3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/P2B1PPP/Q3K2R b K -""

Now black must choose between two lines: 

a) 12... bxc6 13. Bxc6 Rb8 (with a possible follow up as 14. o-o!? Bg4 -attacking- 15. Ne5 (threatening the fork Nd7?) QxBd2 16. NxBg4 Rb2 17. a4 Rf-b8 and black seems to have a good edge despite material theoretical equalness. 

""fen=1r4k1/p3pp1p/2B3p1/2p5/P3P1N1/8/1r1q1PPP/Q4RK1 w - -""

b) ...or try to look for ANOTHER move waiting for a possible cxb7 with Bxb7 (which white won't do probably). Keeping in mind of course all the complications if Bg4...

Back to a) let's imagine that after 13. Rb8 white gets greedy and wants to cash in an exchange by the mate threat 14. Bh6. It seems that the only defence for black is f6 so we have: 

""fen=1rbq1rk1/p3p2p/2B2ppB/2p5/4P3/5N2/P4PPP/Q3K2R w K -""

Once you see that 15. Ng5 leads to nothing I tried the simple one 15. BxRf8. This could be a clear loss by black so you would advise him not to play this. But black has another interesting move: 15. Qa5. 
Would this move will be able to compensate black's exchange (or even full rook if necessary)?
Looking at it it seems black has a powerful attack here. But can it lead to victory?

When these kind of situation happens in real games I sink in a sea so deep that I often end with the wrong move (see my game with Symbian annotated if you want to laugh at me :-(. )

Ok let's see: 

""fen=1rb2Bk1/p3p2p/2B2pp1/q1p5/4P3/5N2/P4PPP/Q3K2R w K -""

I explored the logical 16. Nd2. I cannot remember the line but I couldn't find a clear win if black instead of the natural KxBf8 goes Ba6 (it smells like mate but where's the roast-beef?) or tries to proceed harassing the bishop with Rb6. Anyway... let's see if white can afford 16. Ke2... (it is only the last line of several dozens I found and I can't swear it is the best...)

16. Kd1 is a choice to be explored. The other is...

""fen=1rb2Bk1/p3p2p/2B2pp1/q1p5/4P3/5N2/P3KPPP/Q6R b - -""

of course black goes on attacking and very strongly but hey: white is about to play Bxd7 and then f6 gets fatally weak: black has no easy way to defend it. So after all white can go like that after all just to tempt - as to say - black to go on with the attack and getting unable to defend f6 after the storm is gone. For example: 

16... Ba6+ 17. Ke3 (practically forced because white cannot affor the blac"
483,17,2,Qa5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/qBpP4/4P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',"Well... the previous message was cut by GK's UNADVISED limit of comment's lenght. 

Ok I understand I cannow write an entire book on a position but please programmers WARN me FIRST please!!

It never mind. I just wanted to show whay happens to me when analyzing a particularly tactic postion like this. My life stops and I frequently get lost. And this is the reason I don't play seriouslyu anymore (sigh!).

But the astonisching think is theory ""must"" have explored all these lines - for sure and for sure ""all this work is in vain"" since if the world's champions don't go inte them it must be that all this is so well known by them that both are sure they will get to an even position... and black prefers to go otherwise overattacking c3 thus complicating even more the situation. 

This amazes me. Gelfand's preparation behind this move implies to have reviewed all the lines after Bxc3+ white goes in (because he know he will survive and even get an advantage for the fork... 
But black has this trick... 

And the comments say that the game was not ""such a big deal"" (no literally of course :-).

Funny how quickly a game can go from being level to being hopeless with moves which look sensible and are not apparent blunders but subtle mistakes. Bad luck Jo but you gave me quite a fight!

622,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My previous annotation is debatable and to some extent agreeable but this is highly agreeable. I don't know how my opponent managed to get in a terrible position but I do know I had many ways to win this game. I'll show what I think is best but you are welcome to specify any others even if they aren't as good. Here is the start of the game with the famous pawn push.
623,20,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I was thinking of 2.d4 but I did something different.
624,20,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',One of the more serious approaches to the King's Pawn Game.
625,20,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Good. 2...d6 fine. 2...f6 is not. I still have people play 2...f6 and 3.Nxe4! wins if Black doesn't play 3...Qe7.
626,20,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I believe that this is the Scotch. I'm not fond of playing the Scotch but it is worth a try.
627,20,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He takes.
628,20,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the Main line of the scotch.
629,20,7,Ne5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Somewhat inaccurate. Black might as well have put the Bishop on c5.
630,20,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Everything goes whacky afer this turn.
631,20,9,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1n3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Maybe 6.Be3.
632,20,10,Nf5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1nN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',?! Nope but I know I can do better than this.
633,20,11,Qf6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1nN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This make Black's move look worse than mine although the Knight is pinned to checkmate.
634,20,12,Be3,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1nN2/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is to unpin my Knight.
635,20,13,Ng4,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b2N2/4P1n1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',? I think that Black is trying too hard. 7...d6 is better.
636,20,14,Bxc5,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2B2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Maybe taking the Knight was better but I decided to do this move which is good for White but unfortunate for Black.
637,20,15,d6,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2B2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Does 9.Bd4 look good?

639,20,17,Kd8,b'r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/1BB2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',The ending is near...
640,20,18,1Bd4,b'r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/1B3N2/3BP1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Now this is a potential attack for certain.
641,20,19,1Qe6,b'r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3pq3/1B3N2/3BP1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Before I take the g7 pawn...
642,20,20,1Qxg4,b'r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3pq3/1B3N2/3BP1Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I am going to take yet another free piece.
643,20,21,1Qh6,b'r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3p3q/1B3N2/3BP1Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',My opponent resigns in a definitely losing position for Black. In my view 12.Qxg7! is the best. It threatens mate which is rid of by 12...Qxg7 13.Bxg7 with an easy game. Tell me what you think. Anyways my opponet thought that he had a potentially winning position but that thought disintegrated too soon after he let his minor pieces slip away. Worse for him was that Black helped me set up an attack rather than limit my attack or get rid of it. Also if you have more than one way to win than you can pick that way. However it is wise to seek the best way since the opponent can have a tactic to use against you.
644,21,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',He opens with his Queen-pawn.
645,21,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I play for the French a favorite of mine.

647,21,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Now it is a type of French it appears.
648,21,4,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/1P6/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White has horrible black holes leading into his base.
649,21,5,Bxd2+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/1P6/P2bPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Here I lose control of the dark squares.
650,21,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/1P6/P2QPPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',Developing my Knight and hitting the d4 pawn.

659,21,15,Qg3,b'r5k1/p1p2ppp/1p6/5b1r/5P2/1PRBP1qP/P2Q1RP1/6K1 w - -',Better is Bxh3.

662,21,18,Ra5,b'r5k1/p1R3p1/1p3p2/r6p/4PPqP/1P3R2/P4QP1/6K1 w - -',Much better was Rc5 where I could hope to trade off Rooks.
663,21,19,fxg5,b'r5k1/p1R5/1p6/r5pp/4P2P/1P4R1/P4QPK/3q4 w - -',And there it goes.
664,21,20,2Qg7#,b'r6k/p1R3Q1/1p6/r5pp/4P2P/1P4R1/P5PK/3q4 b - -',There it is. A decent middlegame followed by a terrible late-middlegame/horrid endgame. Please comment since this is a training annotation.
665,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is an unrated game with Jo having some fun with the Damiano Defense (ironically named after the early master who condemned it). We have both played it at various times. The GK computer game analysis is here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17800417&rnd=0.025789561332767663
666,22,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! This move is playable and can be considered more of a psychological approach since white has to be careful not to assume the defense just loses without effort. Bobby Fisher actually only got a draw in a simultaneous game as White from this position once and experts have gotten good games against unprepared White opponents from this position.
667,22,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Safer is 3 Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3... where Black has a difficult defense.
668,22,3,Qe7,b'rnb1kbnr/ppppq1pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',! Best. The Chigorin Variation. Taking the Knight instead loses after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+ forking king and rook) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6?? 7. Qf5+ leads to mate) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) h5 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5! Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8 and now 12. Bxd7 Qxd7 13.Qxa7 leaves White with five extra pawns.
669,22,4,Qxe4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/4q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Consistent. The alternative 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7 Be2 is playable but White retains an advantage.

683,23,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Another unfamiliar opening.
684,23,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Since White is going for a fianchetto I decided to reinforce my d5 pawn.
685,23,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Trying to control the centre.

I had played the first two rounds very badly because I was playing two of the top three seeds and theoretically my best chances would lie with complicated tactical attacking positions so I played them and it ended badly this game I decided to stick with how I play best which is a more positional style of play. actually most of the games I lose are games where I try and be too attacking.
716,24,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I chose the Alekhine defence I have begun playing it a few times as a slightly less common opening that is not unsound and can generate good play.

718,24,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',!? I like this move I think it has been played in a few high level games before and is likely to get us out of book quite quickly. I have played this position about 5-6 times and in each case the position has turned into some sort of mutation of well known openings like the french sicilian and even a bennoni!

The point behind c5 is to 1. deny white d4 and 2. to play on the queenside. if white were to play e5 here I would maybe play Nd5!? and if the knight exchanges then good centre pawns. 
720,24,5,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',d4 would transpose into some form of a sicilian.

This gives a square at d7 for the f knight and strikes at the center to force a descision from white. Now the position looks like something that could be in the databases. possibly some sort of french like position. 
722,24,7,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',It's important to break the pin before white plays e5.

The pawn would be immune from capture since ...b5 7.Nxb5 Qa5+ 8.Nc3 d4 wins the knight. however I wasn't so sure about other lines like 7.e5 Ng8!? 8.Bxe7 Nxe7 or 7.exd

But first I thought I would put the question to the bishop before closing up the position with d4 and e5.

731,24,16,1Bg4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/3pP1b1/N2P1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',At the time I played this nearly instantly however Be6 may have been better. I thought though that this was the only way to protect my e pawn after Nc4 but this is not true at all this move is probably bad as this is my good bishop however trading it for a knight is maybe alright.  
732,24,17,1Nc4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2NpP1b1/3P1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Thematic however White had a good option that I missed during the game. 11.Ne1! since white will eventually want to move the knight anyway to make way for the f pawn it makes perfect sense to do it now. On top of that it proposes a trade of light square bishops which is in whites favour and white black would probably need to move play Be6 anyway which means white would have won about 2 tempo which is very important in an opposite wing attack situation. if I had played 10...Be6 last move I could have met this Nc4 with 11...Bd6 which for some reason never crossed my mind during the game black will be very happy to trade DSB for whites knight so it would have made good sense.

Actually with the white knight on a3 sacing a pawn with the immediate c4 was also a possibility looking to get a bit of activity. 
737,24,22,1Nb1,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1n2n1p/1pp1p3/3pP3/3P1B2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I didn't actually realise until after the game that this knight was actually hampering my c4 advance since white would have two on c4 so I'm not even sure how I would have gone about preparing for it. I think this move is bad not just for that reason but also because it moves a knight that has moved several times and isn't even going to any better squares I mean where is the knight planning to go from here? during the game I thought white may have tried 14.c4!? but after the game I thought that 14.c4 wasn't actually so great perhaps someone can tell me weather 14.c4 would have been good bad or interesting for white and why.
738,24,23,1c4,b'r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/2ppP3/3P1B2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',now that the white knight has moved I can continue on my merry way. Blacks plans are progressing alot faster than whites kingside counterattack due to some fluffing around by white however I see no real advantage yet. the idea with these space gaining wing advances is usually to 1.earn space 2.create targets to attack usually backward or isolated pawns and 3. to break through with open files for the heavy pieces to infiltrate the enemy position. Here I figured blacks most likely plan would be to exchange on d3 then pressure it with Nf6-d7-c5 and possibly Nc6-a7-b5 after more pawn advances and to seek play down the c file. Another option with the person with space has is to win by simply constricting the opponents leaving them with little or know play until they suffocate in their own position.

I had been on the verge of playing somthing reasonable like ...0-0 or ...Nd7 when I remembered a saying ""The side with more space should play to constrict enemy pieces"" and also the idea of calmly preventing any enemy counterplay. So I played this to stop white from playing the f3-f4 advance however this weakens my kings position weakens my already light squares even more than they already are and on top of that white can either prepare the f4 advance with g3 which works since the centre is closed or simply undermine my pawns later with h4."

Rb8 ran into the same sort of problem. so I went with ...b4 however this is because I missed whites next move

White is also closer to taking controling the c file than black who was supposed to be using it. blacks only real positive feature is the amount of space I owned and maybe having the two knights in the semi closed position. white might just have an advantage here.

Actually it is not as bad as I origionally thought during the game after I played the move since black cqn follow up with Rb7 however white is much more comfortable after 33.Bxb3! Rb7 34.Bc4 Bd6 (or Kg7) 35.b3 and white with two pawns connected passed pawns for the exchange may even have the winning chances.

Whatever you do don't try the tactic on move 4 even if you are playing it as White because it becomes a nasty position to terminate unless you're opponent makes a mistake. Do not count on trying to get everything it only makes a position harder to deal with and once again look out for any possible move that you're opponent can make because some of those moves can be used as tactics.

Take note of this because the isolated d pawn becomes the centre of attention in the future. On a side note I do not fear 7. Bxf6 exf6 8. d5 Ne5 9. Bxc4 Nxc4 10. Qa4+ Bd7 11. Qxc4 Rc8 gives black excellent chances. 
956,29,8,Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2n2n1p/8/2BP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Most likely best since 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. 0-0 0-0 11. h3 Bf5 transpose into well known draw lines of the Kornchoni defence. However if you do not like Be3 8. Bf4 is a strong alternative.

Notice how I am not overly aggressive I am simply responding to my opponents threats (in this case threat of Ne5).
960,29,12,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/8/2BP4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Again nothing fancy just responding with solid noncommittal moves. 
961,29,13,1Nb5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/1N6/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',!? This is exactly the type of overly agressive move that black is hoping for just watch how white leterally beats himself up trying to get through black's wall. My guess is that white is fighting for control of e5 by threatening to remove the DSB. However it back fires since 12. Nxd6 Qxd6 gives black complete control of d5 and attacking chances on d4. White's best chances lay on the c file with 11. Rc1 which x-rays the weak c6 point and prevents black from developing his bishop on the power b7-g2 diagonal. A more sublte and positional apporach is 11. h3 preventing Ng4 with an attack on d4. 
962,29,14,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/1pnbpn1p/1N6/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',A very smart move that takes full advantage of white's tempo wasting 10. Nb5. By playing ...b6 Black adds more control of d5 and develops the LSB to a very powerful diagonal.

However it increases black's control of d5 and awakens the slumbering gaint on b7. All of these things are not very good for white so a more tempered approach is needed. Here 16. Rfd1 is very solid for white. Truth be told I was predicting 16. Rfd1 and planning to meet it with Ne7

It often happens that if you can force your attacker opponent into defence they will often do something desperate to get an attack going. What I think happened was the my opponent forgot why he had moved his rook to b1. I think white's best hope to hold is 26. Bf2(challenging the knight) Nfd5 27. Qxc2 Rxc2 28. Bd3

In this variation of the Dragon white often aims to play f3 first to prevent any ...Ng4 ideas to trade off the DSB. Then white will play Qd2 O-O-O and Bh6 removing the vital kingside defender. After all this he will launch a devastating pawn storm with g4 h4 etc. opening up files to the Black king. However black shall not simply sit back and let this happen and he wants to play moves such as Nc6 and Bd7 to develop and then Rc8 (utilizing the half open c-file) move the queen to the queenside and then play b5 looking for counter-play on the opposite flank. This almost certainly leads to very dynamic and fun games where it can end up being who gets to the king first!

Surely he didn't think I was going to sacrifice my piece for merely 2 pawns! Here White should have tried 11. Nb3! which gets out of the powerful a1-h8 diagonal my ""dragon bishop"" is radiating over and regrouped from there. However now I get to play a nice tactic which all but seals up the game. See if you can spot it!"

This is the Scheveningen Sicilian which is rarely seen nowadays because of the Keres attack with 6. g4!? and its popularity in accelerating the KS attack with g4-g5 push coming.  This is certainly a way to play.  I was not too good on the theory of the keres at this time and so opted for a more positional set up

I have the bishop pair but they need targets so I look to go a5 and weaken the black QS structure.  Furthermore my 3 on 2 on the qs suggests I should aim for a passed pawn there

1128,35,15,2b5,b'1r6/2r1k1pp/Rp2pp1n/1P6/5PP1/3B3P/2P5/5RK1 b - -',Hammering the weak pawn in place.  However a winning plan was Bxh7!! which is hard to justify after ...f5 seemingly trapping the bishop but it appears white gets out in time.  I thought for a good 15-20 minutes here and could not find a winning plan.  Such a shame when my opponent's position looks passive and dreadful.  No activity for any of his pieces!
1129,35,16,2h4,b'1r6/2r1kn1p/Rp2ppp1/1P6/5PPP/3B4/2P3K1/5R2 b - -',Keeping the 4-3 at bay on the KS.

A better plan for me was to double on the a file perhaps at an earlier stage.  I instead went for king centralization and simplification which is the wrong plan because  black can untie himself and quickly strike back

1142,36,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Mark usually plays the open variation against it.

1149,36,9,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So this is the move that I used to play at university.

1190,37,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is not a blunder but I am not crazy about this response.  According to Jack Stockel 2.Nf3 is the proper way to respond to the Sicilian Defense followed by 3.d4.  However blake78613 mentioned that this move is perfectly playable in response to 1...c5.
1191,37,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is Mr. Stockel's favorite continuation of the Sicilian Defense.
1192,37,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is ok move but I would have played it sooner if I were white.
1193,37,5,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Once he decided to bring his other knight out I was not hesitating to play this move.  If he played the Open Sicilian immediately I would have advanced my a7 pawn later in the game.  For Open Sicilian 1.e4 c5 2.Nf6 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 or 4.Qxd4? are played followed by 4...a6.  That prevents your opponents knight or LSB from threatening the b file.
1194,37,6,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',At this point he decides to play the Open Sicilian.  If I were white I would have done the same thing earlier in the game.   
1195,37,7,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',? As I had mentioned earlier this is a mistake.  5.Nxd4 would have been his best move for this continuation.  He has violated General Opening Principles by bringing his queen out this early.  Therefore I will not hesitate to chase his queen with 5.Nc6.  Although 5.Nc6! the obsession will cost me and I will explain this momentarily.
1196,37,8,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1np4/1p6/Q3P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq b6',?? I originally viewed this as a ! because I made this move to chase his queen in my attempt to gain another tempo.  However I was not thinking ahead and overlooked his LSB due to this obsession.  It turns out to be a serious blunder for two reasons.  First I will loose a pawn after 7.Bxb5.  Most importantly I am now in a lot of trouble even though this is not the loosing blunder.  That is because this move will cause other problems during the game.  In addition I am going to chase more pieces throughout the game due to my obsession.  This will eventually cause me to loose the game.  
1197,37,9,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/3bpppp/p1np4/1B6/Q3P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',?? In this position my knight is still pinned.  Therefore I moved my LSB to undue the pin.  According to Jack Stockel it is best to move your bishop if you want to break a knight pin (get your knight unpinned).  However 7...axb5 would have been my best move.  If 7...axb5 8.Qxb5.  That way my a pawn is exchanged for his LSB so I am 3 points ahead.  If that happened I would have been able to fix my previous mistake.  At this point I am in even more trouble due to my played move.  Consequently he is going to win a free piece with 8.Bxc6.  
1198,37,10,Rc8,b'2rqkbnr/3bpppp/p1Bp4/8/Q3P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',?? At this point I realize that I can no longer attack his queen with my rook so I decide to attack his bishop.  However this turns out to be another serious blunder because he will place me in a very serious check with 9.Bxd7+.  What makes this serious?  That will be answered shortly.
1199,37,11,Qxd7,b'2r1kbnr/3qpppp/p2p4/8/Q3P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',"This move was forced.  As -chess- would say ""no options"".  If I had played 8...Rc7! 9.Bxd7+ would not have been feasible or 9...Rxd7 loosing his LSB.  However he is going to win another free pawn due to this check after 10.Qxa6.  That is what makes this check serious.  Remember: I am behind so it is especially bad when I inadvertently give away material.  As Jack Stockel would say ""Don't give things away""."
1200,37,12,Rc6,b'4kbnr/3qpppp/Q1rp4/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQk -',? On a normal basis I would not mark this.  However my attitude is the mistake not the actual move.  What is the logic behind this?  Well I am still obsessed with trying to gain tempo by chasing pieces.  Therefore I decided to chase his queen.
1201,37,13,1Qa8+,b'Q3kbnr/3qpppp/2rp4/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',I honestly thought that he would retreat his queen.  However he decides to place me in check but this is a nuisance.

I am also trying to trick him into a threefold repetition because I am still behind.  However I will not be able to trick him and that will be explained shortly."
1203,37,15,1Qa3,b'2r1kbnr/3qpppp/3p4/8/4P3/Q1N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',"! He spots my trick so he decides to play this move as opposed to 12.Qa6.  I am not surprised because binblaster has illustrated the importance in knowing your opponents plans as well as your own.  In addition ION said ""always assume your opponent will spot the threat"" in one of my earlier annotations."

As it turns out I advanced my g7 pawn so that I could develop my DSB but that does not happen.  Instead my DSB will remain crammed ""jammed in"" as Mr. Stockel would say.  According to Jack it is a bad idea to leave your knight or bishop ""jammed in"" as it puts you at a strategical disadvantage.  Note: a strategical disadvantage is more serious then a tactical disadvantage.  That is because I have learned that tactic=short term plan but strategy=long term plan."
1205,37,17,1Nd5,b'2r1kbnr/3qpp1p/3p2p1/3N4/4P3/Q4N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQk -',! He decides to move his knight in an attempt to play 13.Nb6!! forking my queen and rook.  However I am not going to allow the fork.

Then I just figured out that this move was played because the threat of 16.Nxc4 was very high.  However this turns out to be my loosing blunder and I will explain this concept later on.

Like my first game against binblaster my queen is trapped as I had mentioned earlier.  Therefore the game is now officially lost because he will win my queen after 18.Nxd3.

First ""Don't give up right away"".  Second ""If you know that you can't win try to get a draw"".  Therefore I decide to attack his g2 pawn but this was a horrible choice.  That will be explained shortly. "

After that he will win another free piece after 20.Qxf8 so I will be 17 points behind.  In addition he will attack my f7 pawn after he takes my DSB.
1217,37,29,f5,b'5Qnr/3kp2p/3p2p1/5pr1/4P3/2PN4/PP1N1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ f6',?? As I had mentioned earlier my f pawn is now protected but this is not a good choice.  20...f6 would have been best for he will force an exchange with 21.exf5 Rxg2 but I am far behind.  On the other hand 20...f6 also protects but without the exchange. 
1218,37,30,2Qg7,b'6nr/3kp1Qp/3p2p1/5P2/8/2PN4/PP1N1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',At this point I resign because he is going to win my h8 rook and I have lost so much material beforehand.  Therefore I have no way of catching up.  In general it is more important to think ahead then to obsess over chasing pieces and trying to gain tempi.  If you only concentrate on chasing pieces and tempo gain you will not play as well.  That is what I learned from this opponent.  Having said that I would like to thank kibika for giving me this game.
1219,38,0,1f3,b'r1bqk2r/2p2pp1/p2p1n1p/1pb5/3pPB2/1BPP1P2/PP4PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',This is the losing move.  White would have done much better to capture the d-pawn and follow Bxd4 with Nc3. 
1220,38,1,1g5,b'r1bqk2r/2p2p2/p2p1n1p/1pb3p1/3pPB2/1BPP1P2/PP4PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq g6',Good move increasing the pressure the Black d-pawn holds on white's Queen-side.
1221,38,2,1Bg3,b'r1bqk2r/2p2p2/p2p1n1p/1pb3p1/3pP3/1BPP1PB1/PP4PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White needs to loosen up the Queen-side by getting his knight in play.  Nd2 iis not desirable. dxc3+ loses the knight.  Bd2 would not have been helpful either.  With dxc3+ White's response will be followed with cxb2 and the rook falls anyway--just as with Bg3.  The best move is withdrawing the Bishop to its home square.   
1222,38,3,Nxd5,b'r2qk2r/2p2p2/p2p3p/1p1n2p1/4P3/3P1P2/P4RPP/Q5K1 w kq -',White can regain some of his lost material--but without a serious black error the game is lost.  
1223,38,4,2Qxf6,b'r7/2pk1p2/p2p1Q2/1p1n2p1/4P3/3P1P2/P4RPP/6K1 b - -',Probably should have avoided the exchange with Qh3+ and follow that up with exd5.  White's queen would be badly placed but some of the lost material would be recovered.  Pawn structure would also be weak with doubled d-pawns facing a connected phalanx of queen-side pawns.  
1224,38,5,Kb3,b'r7/5p2/3p1n2/2pP2p1/4P2P/1k3PP1/p2K4/R7 w - -',After 38.Kc1 Ka6 white's king and rook are hamstrung.  Black can move the rook and knight into action to wipe up white's pawns and end the game.  
1225,39,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',My usual Petroff though earlier in my career I preferred 2...Nc6 and I have also played the Marshall Gambit of the Scandinavian (1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6) and even some Sicilian dragons.
1226,39,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',!? I don't see this often. It can lead to the Boden-Kieseritzky gambit (3...Nxe4 4.Nc3) of which I know very little. Note that after 3...Nxe4 4.Nxe5?! d5 is good for Black but it's a tricky line. I didn't want to end up in all this stuff so instead I decided after a short think to play 3...Nc6 transposing into the Two knights which I have played earlier when I still preferred 2...Nc6.
1227,39,2,Ng5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The critical test of the line but I was happy to see it. There are some alternatives: the quiet 4.d3 4.d4 (about which I know little I should study that) and 4.Nc3?! but that runs into the fork trick: 4...Nxe4! 5.Nxe4 d5 winning back the piece with good play for Black.
1228,39,3,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',Almost forced to block the attack on f7 but 4...Bc5!? is another very tricky line called the Traxler. I know there are some mini-tournaments played with this opening but I didn't participate in one of them and I don't know the opening so well so I decided to stick to the main line which I know pretty well.
1229,39,4,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/n2Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Better than 5...Nxd5? when White gets a strong initiative with 6.d4 (which was my preference when I played the 4.Ng5 line as White) or a wild attack with 6.Nxf7!?. It might be playable for Black but you have to defend very very accurately. My move is the main line but there are some alternatives: 5...b5 and 5...Nd4 both leading to very complex positions. You should study those very carefully before trying them out.
1230,39,5,c6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/nB1Pp1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This makes it a gambit. Black can also play 6...Bd7 which is a quieter line. Black will eventually be able to round up the d5 pawn so he won't be a pawn down but White gets a good game. In this line it is Black who has all the fun and attacking chances though the compensation for the pawn is not trivial at first sight.
1231,39,6,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/n3p1N1/8/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Another line is 8.Qf3 but I don't know much about that variation. This is the main line but he needed some time to think so I knew he was out of his opening theory.
1232,39,7,e4,b'r1bqkb1r/p4pp1/2p2n1p/n7/4p3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White's pieces are chased around while Black can develop their game. This is still the main line of the 4.Ng5 variation all moves ffrom 4.Ng5 on are the most frequently played ones.
1233,39,8,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/p4pp1/2pb1n1p/n3N3/4p3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Another developing move with tempo. You can see now that the plan for Black will be to attack on the kingside and/or in the center.
1234,39,9,1Nc4,b'r1bqk2r/p4pp1/2pb1n1p/n7/2N1p3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! This is a deviation from the main line. I don't think it's a good move because Black can exchange his only weak piece (the knight on a5) for a knight which was controlling quite a lot of the central squares. In the 365chess.com database it has good stats for Black.
1235,39,10,1Nxc4,b'r1bqk2r/p4pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2n1p3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Although you usually don't want to exchange pieces when you're a pawn down I thought that this move was justified because I exchange off a passive piece for an active one. Most people who had been in this position before me agreed with this assessment this is the most played move in the position.
1236,39,11,Qc7,b'r1b1k2r/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',More common is 12...O-O but this is fine as well. The h2 pawn is not attacked yet because after (say) 13.Nc3 Bxh2? runs into 14.g3 winning the bishop but if White wants to castle short he has to remove the attack on the h2 pawn first.
1237,39,12,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2B1p3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! this blocks the attack on the h2 pawn but it turns out to be a bad move since I exploit the weakness of the light squares on the kingside later on in the game. 13.h3 is preferable.
1238,39,13,1Nc3,b'r1b2rk1/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2B1p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',White develops but the Black pieces are better coordinated for attack and he is ahead in development. Whitestill has to make three moves to achieve the opening goals (castling playing the b or d pawn and then developing the c1 bishop) while Black only needs one move (a developing move of the c8 bishop). Black has a good game.
1239,39,14,1O-O,b'r1b1r1k1/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2B1p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Maybe not the safest place for the king but castling queenside takes a lot of time.
1240,39,15,1Bg4,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/2B1p1b1/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',!? I had planned the next sequence. I wanted to 'undevelop' one of White's pieces before getting to h3 which is the square on which the bishop is best placed.
1241,39,16,1Be2,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/4p1b1/2N3P1/PPPPBP1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Note that 16.Qe1? is impossible due to 16...Bh3 winning the exchange so it was either this or 16.Ne2.
1242,39,17,1Bh3,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/4p3/2N3Pb/PPPPBP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',As said before this was the square I wanted to place my bishop on. It takes advantage of the weakness of the light squares around the White king.
1243,39,18,Bc5,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/2p2n1p/2b5/4p3/2N3Pb/PPPPBP1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',?! Now that the rook has moved f2 becomes weak. However 17...Qb6 was probably a more accurate way to take advantage of that. After 18.Na4 (necessary to prevent 18...Bc5 when White cannot defend f2 anymore) I could play 18...Qd4 and then 19.c3 would weaken the d3 square and I could follow up with 19...Qd5 which would give me a strong attack on the kingside. I think this is a typical mistake for a rapid game: I was also thinking of 17...Qb6 but I was not sure which of the two was more accurate. After analyzing at home with my computer I saw 17...Qb6 was better.
1244,39,19,1d3,b'r3r1k1/p1q2pp1/2p2n1p/2b5/4p3/2NP2Pb/PPP1BP1P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',? This move loses. 18.Na4 was necessary to prevent the coming attack on f2. I would probably have played 18...Bd4 and after 19.c3 you can see why 17...Qb6 was more accurate last move. In this variation I have to play 19...Bb6 after which White can gain the bishop pair with 20.Nxb6 Qxb6 or 20...axb6. Moreover I can't take advantage of the d3 square so easily because my queen is not on the d file yet.
1245,39,20,1Qb6,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/1qp2n1p/2b5/4p3/2NP2Pb/PPP1BP1P/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Probably this was the moment when my opponent realized how weak f2 was. He can't do anything to defend it except for giving up the exchange with 19.Rf1 Bxf1 20.Qxf1 (which is probably relatively best in this position).
1246,39,21,1Na4,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/1qp2n1p/2b5/N3p3/3P2Pb/PPP1BP1P/R1BQR1K1 b - -',? A logical move but it's Desperation. As I mentioned earlier 19.Rf1 was best.
1247,39,22,Qa5,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/q7/N3p3/3P2Pb/PPP1Bb1P/R1BQR2K w - -',! Obviously I couldn't take on e1 yet (probably what my opponent was hoping for?) since the queen was attacked but with this tempo attack on the knight I win the exchange anyway.
1248,39,23,exd3,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/q7/8/2Np2Pb/PPP1B2P/R1B1Q2K w - -',Opening more attack lines and pinning the bishop. White is completely lost here: all his pieces are pinned undeveloped or tied down to defence not to mention he's an exchange down.
1249,39,24,Nd5,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p4p/q2n4/8/2NP2Pb/PP2B2P/R1B1Q2K w - -',Wanting to force an exchange of knights so I can play ...Qd5+ with inevitable mate. Now we can see how the weakness of the light squares around White's king plays a role.
1250,39,25,2Bd2,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p4p/q2n4/8/2NP2Pb/PP1BB2P/R3Q2K b - -',? White had to sacrifice a pawn with 24.b4 if he wanted to prolong the game but the end result is already clear. I also had some 7 minutes left on my clock so time was not an issue.
1251,39,26,2Bxc3,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p4p/q7/8/2BP2Pb/PP2B2P/R3Q2K b - -',? A blunder in the absolute sense of the word since it runs into a mate in three but there was no alternative but to resign really.
1252,39,27,2Qd5+,b'r3r1k1/p4pp1/2p4p/3q4/8/2BP2Pb/PP2B2P/R3Q2K w - -',Mate on g2 is inevitable and can only be prolonged by interposing with the bishop on f3 (25...Qd5+26.Bf3 Qxf3+ 27.Kg1 Qg2#) so White resigned. I think this game shows how quickly it can go wrong for White in the Two knights. All his problems were mainly caused by one bad move 18.d3?. I think the Two knights is a fun opening to play for Black and I enjoy to play it from time to time especially this line. By the way I finished on 4/7 in the rapid tournament (under 1650 section) after a 0/2 start so I was pretty satisfied with the end result. I hope you enjoyed the annotation.
