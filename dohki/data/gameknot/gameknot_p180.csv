0,0,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the recommended way of playing the Semi-Slav according to American IM Larry Kaufman in his excellent book 'The Chess Advantage in Black and White' (McKay Chess Library 2004). Kaufman's repertoire opening book is worth having a look at if you're searching for practical openings that aren't too analysed to death (Najdorf Sveshnikov etc) or too drawish. The point of 3...c6 instead of 3...Nf6 is to avoid the Queens Gambit Declined exchange variation (4.cxd4) which is supposedly good for white because he hasn't yet committed his kings knight (to f3) so can more easily play f3 and e4 (after e3 Bd3 and Ne2-g3 etc). This move order means that black has to be prepared for the Marshall Gambit (4.e4) which is tricky but for a clued-up black player is probably not quite sound (though I have been on the wrong end of this in an over-the-board game!).
1,0,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Now black has a choice. 5...Be7 is super-solid and can lead to the Lasker Defence the Classical or the Tartakower; 5...Nbd7 can lead to a Classical or Cambridge Springs set-up (black plays 6...Qa5 which usually gives black the two bishops (after Bxf6) but allows white to keep an edge). Instead the move I chose is the whole point of the Semi-Slav's c6 and e6 (a plan to take on c4 either to hold onto the pawn with b5 or after white plays Bxc4 to hit the bishop with b5 and follow up with Bb7 a6 and a later c5). This leads to a razor-sharp position.
2,0,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Black snags a pawn but now white can set up a classic pawn centre (pawns on e4 and d4) with an immediate threat of 7.e5
3,0,3,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq e3',. . . which white does.
4,0,4,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq b6',This is the ambitious (and only real) way of playing holding onto the pawn. It does however invite the enormous complications of the Botvinnik Variation which is nicely explained in Glenn Flear's interesting book 'Starting Out: Slav and Semi-Slav' (Everyman 2005). Please note however that this book is five years old which is light years when it comes to Slav and Semi-Slav opening theory. Kaufman instead recommends avoiding the Botvinnik by playing 5...h6 (this is called the Moscow Variation). However the Anti-Moscow Gambit (in which white gives up a pawn after 6.Bh4 g5 7.Bg3 dxc4) gives white a lasting positional advantage and is not easy to play against.
5,0,5,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p2P1B1/2pP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',The only move to prevent the loss of a piece.
6,0,6,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/p4p2/2p1pn1p/1p2P1p1/2pP3B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq g6',Ditto.
7,0,7,1g3,b'r1bqkb1r/p2n1p2/2p1pn2/1p2P1B1/2pP4/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White's usual move here is 11.exf6 when 11...Nxf6 would leave black's remaining knight stuck in a terribly inconvenient pin and would not be recommended. After 11.exf6 black invariably plays 11...Bb7. Because white delays taking on f6 by one move black has an interesting alternative to committing the bishop to the b7 square (according to Flear).
8,0,8,1Qa5,b'r1b1kb1r/p2n1p2/2p1pn2/qp2P1B1/2pP4/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This is it to which Flear attaches an exclamation mark: 11...Qa5! Like most players I LOVE to play moves with such a suffix.
9,0,9,Ba6,b'r3kb1r/p2n1p2/b1p1pP2/q5B1/1ppPN3/6P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',"Flear says: ""The bishop on a6 defends the c-pawn and is part of a plan to rapidly mobilise the queenside."""
10,0,10,1Be2,b'r3kb1r/p2n1p2/b1p1pP2/q5B1/1ppPN3/6P1/PP2BP1P/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I couldn't understand this move (and still don't). It seems entirely natural to play 14.Bg2 (especially after 11.g3). In the source game of this variation (in which Mikhail Botvinnik beat Arnold Denker in the famous USSR-USA radio match of 1945) Denker put his bishop on e2 and was crushed (and that was with the g-pawn remaining on g2). However according to Flear 14.Qf3 is the move to play presumably to x-ray target the c6 pawn and keep the white bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal for the time being.
11,0,11,1Rd8,b'3rkb1r/p2n1p2/b1p1pP2/q5B1/1ppPN3/6P1/PP2BP1P/R2QK2R w KQk -',I can't remember why I played this instead of 14...0-0-0. I recall seeing a number of games in which white managed to get a pawn to e7 with a fork on two pieces and figured that the king might be useful in the centre. In hindsight I'm not sure this was a great move.
12,0,12,1Qc1,b'3rkb1r/p2n1p2/b1p1pP2/q5B1/1ppPN3/6P1/PP2BP1P/R1Q1K2R b KQk -',A double attack on the c4 pawn but I'm not sure moving the queen away from the d1-h5 diagonal was a good idea (also the queen is no longer defending the e2 bishop and the d3 square is weakened).
13,0,13,1c5,b'3rkb1r/p2n1p2/b3pP2/q1p3B1/1ppPN3/6P1/PP2BP1P/R1Q1K2R w KQk -',In this opening black is pretty well committed to attack as the best form of defence. This move as well as hitting white's only central pawn also opens the a8-h1 diagonal for black's QB.
14,0,14,1d5,b'3rkb1r/p2n1p2/b3pP2/q1pP2B1/1pp1N3/6P1/PP2BP1P/R1Q1K2R b KQk -',White takes up the challenge.
15,0,15,1c3,b'3rkb1r/p2n1p2/b3pP2/q1pP2B1/1p2N3/2p3P1/PP2BP1P/R1Q1K2R w KQk -',I figured that this move prevents white from castling (the e2 bishop is then hanging) and if 17.Bxa6 Qxa6 white still can't castle and has waves of weak white squares flooding around his king.
16,0,16,1exf7+,b'3rkb1r/p4P2/b4P2/q1p1n1B1/1p2N3/2p3P1/PP2BP1P/R1Q1K2R b KQk -',I was expecting 18.e7 when (as mentioned earlier) a white pawn makes its way to the seventh rank with a fork. I'm sure this is weaker. It gives a check and on the face of it exposes the black king on the kingside. But the f6 pawn actually acts as a useful shield and meanwhile black has strong central and queenside threats. One interesting variation could be: 18.e7 Bxe2 19.exd8=Q+ Qxd8 20.Qe3 (20.Kxe2?? Qd3+ 21.Ke1 Nf3 mate) 20...cxb2 21.Kxe2 bxa1=Q 22.Rxa1 Rxh2 23.Nxc5 when 23...Qd5 (centralising the queen) looks to be about equal.
17,0,17,Bxe2,b'3r1b1r/p4k2/5P2/q1p1n1B1/1p2N3/2P3P1/P3bP1P/R1Q1K2R w KQ -',This means white cannot castle except 'by hand' (Kf1-g2-Re1). But that takes three moves and right now it's black who has a lead in development (and those white squares are still desperately weak).
18,0,18,Qa6+,b'3r1b1r/p4k2/q4P2/2p1n1B1/1p2N3/2P3P1/P3KP1P/R1Q4R w - -',Logical. The black queen moves to a white diagonal. Note how much control black has over the crucial d3 square.
19,0,19,2c4,b'3r1b1r/p4k2/q4P2/2p1n1B1/1pP1N3/6P1/P3KP1P/R1Q4R b - -',White hastens to block the diagonal (even if only for a moment). Why play this move giving up a pawn? Firstly 21.Ke1?? allows 21...Nf3 mate! And 21.Ke3?? leads to 21...Qd3+ 22.Kf4 Qf3+ 23.Kxe5 Re8+ 24.Kd5 Qxe4 mate (those white squares again). After 21...Nxc4 white can play 22.Kf3 and try to get the king to g2 (probably the best option). If 22.Kf1 then 22...Nd6+ wins the white knight. And 22.Ke1 invites 22...Ne5 targeting the f3 square and more crucially a royal fork on d3.
20,0,20,2Rd4,b'5b1r/p4k2/q4P2/2p1n1B1/1pPrN3/6P1/P3KP1P/R1Q4R w - -',I really liked this move. Yet again it's a tempo gainer (the obvious threat is 22...Rxe5+). Also taking with the rook on c4 is now a very nasty threat because a) it gains a tempo by attacking white's queen on c1 and b) a subsequent discovered check with a rook move is brutal. Meanwhile because the black knight is still on e5 the king plan of f3 and g2 is impossible.
21,0,21,2Nd2,b'5b1r/p4k2/q4P2/2p1n1B1/1pPr4/6P1/P2NKP1P/R1Q4R b - -',To stop the rook taking the c4 pawn.

23,0,23,2Qe6+,b'5b1r/p4k2/4qP2/2p3B1/1pnr4/6P1/P2N1P1P/R1Q1K2R w - -',Now the black queen comes to the e-file with a gain of tempo. This wasn't a difficult move to find. A check after all is a check.
24,0,24,Nxd2+,b'5b1r/p4k2/4qP2/2p3B1/1p1r4/6P1/P2n1P1P/R1Q2K1R w - -',Bang goes the defender of the f3 square.
25,0,25,Qd5,b'5b1r/p4k2/5P2/2pq4/1p1r4/6P1/P2B1P1P/R1Q2K1R w - -',And now a double attack (on the bishop on d2 and the rook on h1). Black's reply is forced.
26,0,26,Rc4,b'5b1r/p4k2/5P2/2p5/1pr1q3/4B1P1/P3KP1P/R1Q4R w - -',The rook finally arrives at c4 with tempo and eyes up the c2 square. I thought this was a strong move but didn't quite appreciate how strong until I started to examine the white queen's options for retreating from the attack.
27,0,27,2Qg1,b'5b1r/p4k2/5P2/2p5/1pr1q3/4B1P1/P3KP1P/R5QR b - -',An unfortunate necessity. Other queen moves lead to a debacle: 22.Qb1 Rc2+ 23.Kd1 (Ke1 then Qxh1+) Qd3+ followed by mate on e2; 22.Qd1 Rc2+ 23.Kf1 (or e1) Qxh1+. 22.Qd2 or b2 and the black rook going to c2 is decisive.
28,0,28,2Bh6,b'7r/p4k2/5P1b/2p5/1pr1q3/4B1P1/P3KP1P/R5QR w - -',Obvious. The idea behind this move is to exchange the e3 bishop which is the glue holding together white's defence.
29,0,29,Rc2,b'7r/p4k2/5P2/2p5/1p2q3/4P1P1/P1r4P/R4KQR w - -',The rook reaches c2 and it's all over because of the twin threats of 31...Qf3+ and 31...Qd3+ (note those white squares again).
30,0,30,Qe2#,b'7r/p4k2/5P2/2p5/1p6/4P1P1/P1r1q2P/R3K1Q1 w - -',"Fitting I think that mate is given on e2 the square on which white's KB should probably have never visited.

If you're looking for an opening to play against 1.d4 and 2.c4 then the Semi-Slav is rich in possibilities. Obviously you have to be clued up on the Meran and the Anti-Meran (both covered in Flear's and Kaufman's books) but I've found that the positions you get with black always seem to be nicely unbalanced and offer chances of fighting for the initiative (a bit like playing the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4). The Nimzo-Indian also fits the bill against 1.d4 and 2.c4 but white can avoid it by not playing 3.Nc3. personally I don't much like playing the black side of the Queens Indian (3.Nf3 b7) and the Bogo-Indian (3.Nf3 Bb4+) offers at least one forced variation which gives black a cramped position that at best is drawish. So my advice is: MUG UP ON THE SEMI-SLAV: (""there is one defense that does it all – the Semi-Slav"" says Kaufman)."

Just had another tough game against The Dentist.  I managed to win a pawn early on in the game but alas in the middlegame I went for another side pawn the a pawn with my rook only to allow my opponent to control the e file with his rook which had near devastating consequences ...... for me.  Luckily my opponent did not make the best moves and just could not resist giving a check - now here is another example of The Perils of Giving Check - it did not quite have the devastating consequences for the Dentist as it did my buddy Bob Jacobs but it did cede the initiative in my favour and then I eventually won the game which starts off as a Nimsovich Defense i.e. Nc6 in response to 1. e4.  Master Freddy has been known to play this with varying success.  One last word before I launch into the game - here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game here:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13914788&rnd=0.18665816909941102"

Chillingly I had put Fou Lenoir on e3 but just before I clicked submit I saw that sac and pressed reset and moved Henry to d1 instead thus avoiding a humiliating loss against Class D oppo.

467,14,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This starts off the Sicilian Defense. The goal of this opening is to not expose the king and go for a center-pawn trade for a side-pawn after white plays d4. The main square of this opening is d5 because if black takes control of d5 white will not be able to do anything else without regaining that square.

In variations such as the Yugoslav the white bishop does not do much. The black light-squared bishop can cause problems as well. I play this opening because there is not much theory to memorize.

Black has no real defense of the bishop so he would be forced to exchange when the white pawn structure is nearly textbook perfect if only for now.  White misses the idea or discounts its credibility and instead forces the knight exchange.
650,20,13,3Kxc3,b'6k1/6bp/6p1/p1Bbpp2/3Pp3/1PK1P2P/4BPP1/8 b - -',Who is really better?  Both sides have the bishop pair and can deliver mate if the other side is not careful.  White can force the LS bishop exchange after which he will have an isolated c pawn to match black's isolated a pawn.
651,20,14,Kf7,b'8/5kbp/6p1/p1Bb1p2/3Pp3/1PK4P/4BPP1/8 w - -',Black sees the bishop exchange threat as well as the fact that the white king is influencing play.  It is time for the black king to put his influence on the board.
652,20,15,e3,b'8/5kbp/1B4p1/p2b1p2/3P4/1PK1p2P/4BPP1/8 w - -',Black cannot defend the a pawn so he gets an active bishop for it and a shot at destroying the white pawn structure but this game may end up being a case where the weaker pawn structure wins.  The Bc4 idea no longer seems so strong because a promote threat has been injected into the position.
653,20,16,Bf6,b'8/5k1p/1B3bp1/p4p2/3P3P/1PK1P3/4B1b1/8 w - -',White's center is good and the h4 pawn cannot escape although white can force an even exchange.

661,20,24,Bb4,b'8/8/1B2k3/p2b2p1/1bBP4/1P6/4K3/8 w - -',White only has bishop and king moves.
662,20,25,4bxc4,b'8/8/1B2k3/p5p1/1bPP4/4K3/8/8 b - -',Better pawn formation?  Who wouldn't want a pawn on c4 and d4 as white?  Well earlier at least.  Now it seems likely that black will queen first.
663,20,26,a3,b'8/8/1B2k3/6p1/1bPPK3/p7/8/8 w - -',White can control a1 now but its defense makes the game easier for black.  49...Bc3 fails to 50.Kd3 when the black bishop gets tied to the defense of the a pawn.
664,20,27,Kf6,b'8/8/1B3k2/3P2p1/1bP1K3/p7/8/8 w - -',Black does not really need either pawn to queen so long as it means that his position improves relative to white's position.  Perhaps that statement is really more of an exaggeration.  White may even still be winning but 51.c5 fails because the black a pawn will queen first.
665,20,28,a2,b'8/8/6k1/2PP2p1/1b1BK3/8/p7/8 w - -',There are a few promising continuations for white but to be safe he needs to advance his king.  I am counting on queening first.  My original thoughts were that he can realistically make me abandon the a pawn with a move like d6 shifting the center of play to where he is strongest and can most easily control but I have to consider that 53.d6 Bxd6 wins the pawn for free because of the a pawn.  The white bishop is already overworked which is why I believe white's best move is Ke5.
666,20,29,5c6,b'8/8/2P3k1/3P2p1/1b1BK3/8/p7/8 b - -',White would be marginally better off abandoning the c pawn and advancing his king.  I originally believed this was weaker than d6 as d6 creates space for his king and forces a defense of the queening squares by Ba5 but as just noted the move fails to Bxc5!  Here in the position as played black gets to without actually attacking a pawn remove it from the center of play.  I believe here is where the game firmly shifts to black's advantage.  Black has probably been winning for a few moves but uncertainty was rampant because of the given time controls.  The concept of 'winning' is a dangerous idea in chess because one mistake can reverse it in an instant.
667,20,30,5Bd6,b'8/8/2Pb2k1/3P2p1/3BK3/8/p7/8 w - -',54.Be5 fails because black will simply exchange and then queen.  Black has a plan to exploit the overworked white bishop.
668,20,31,5Bc3,b'8/8/2Pb4/3P1k2/8/2B2Kp1/p7/8 b - -',And black realizes that he needs to force White to take opposition on the g pawn so that Black can win the White pawns.

670,20,33,6Bc3,b'8/8/2Pb4/3P4/6k1/2B3p1/p5K1/8 b - -',White underestimates the black idea.  That and his bishop is tied to a1!

Nf7 - transferring my knight over to the kingside to attack/defend if necessary and I have at least moved one piece off that back row and next move I plan to put Glenda on h3 and then castle queenside.  However Freddy puts a stop to the latter plan by keeping Henry either in the centre or having to go kingside after all.

According to gameknot I would have had to have given up Glenda for the knight just to limp on against a player nearly 400 points above my rating.  No thanks I prefer it this way.  So I think in retrospect that my attack was premature and Freddy thought that it was.  However would you the jury rather see this than for me to keep defending all the time?  I look forward to hearing your views on this.  Hope you have all had a good weekend - bye for now - Joanne

Louis Paulsen a German was one of the early practitioners of the Sicilian defence and was a defensive player who said that brilliant attacks would fail against correct defence. Paulsen could draw one game against Paul Morphy and his ideas influenced Wilhelm Steinitz who developed the art of defence in chess.
Black's idea here is to exchange his Bishop's pawn for White's central pawn on d5 and build a central pawn majority which will be pushed in the endgame for queening one of the central pawns. An endgame is favourable for Black. So White's strategy is to play for a win in the middle game by attacking Black's king whether it is castled or not. The tactical battle in the middle game is a minefield and either player can win or lose suddenly as happened in this game."

The idea is to play an early Bxb1 giving up the bishop for white's QN. I thought for a while about playing 3.c4; did I really want to allow 3...Bxb1? It leaves white with the two bishops of course. I've never quite believed that they are as strong as they are made out if the beneficiary of such an exchange tries to utilise their power by simply 'opening the game up'. I've always thought that certainly in the middle game the player with the two bishops can benefit not so much because of the power of the pair of clerics but because the opponent will probably struggle to defend the squares of the colour of the bishop they have given up. Usually the player with the B and N will try to stick their pawns on the colour square of which they have no defending bishop. In this case black would play an early e6 and c6; in a normal QGD or a Slav they would be trying for the freeing moves e5 or c5; without the white-squared bishop that strategy MUST lead to white-square weaknesses. So a Baltic Defence-style plan must logically lead to a passive game.
906,31,1,c5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp1b2/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',Now this is very optimistic. If such freeing moves for black could be played as early as the third move in a major opening complex such as a reversed Queens Gambit Declined (after 'freeing' the QB with Bf5) then the advantage of the first move couldn't reasonably be considered an 'advantage'.
907,31,2,e6,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/q1Pp1b2/8/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This has to be a mistake (see my previous note). Surely black can't get away with something as wonderful (for the second player) as something like 6.Be2 Bxc5. I remember shaking my head at not seeing 5...Qxc5 which is a Queens Gambit Accepted in reverse; because of the extra move I'm sure that has to be good for white.

There was no way I would exchange the d6 knight for black's f5 bishop and the a4 bishop is still a better minor piece than the c6 knight. The well-known American chess writer Jeremy Silman hammers on about minor piece 'imbalances' in a number of his books: he recommends constantly assessing your and your opponent's minor pieces. In this position both white knights are superior to their counterparts and white's white-squared bishop is better than its rival (which although outside the pawn chain is hardly exerting any influence on the board). Black's other bishop is I suppose level with white's black-squared bishop (which is only operational on one diagonal right now). But black's bishop on f8 is a some way from being developed (it would actually love to take the d6 knight) and white's bishop on d2 would be a good minor piece on c3. All-in-all the 'imbalances' hugely favour white. Incidentally Silman makes the point in one of his books that the main reason chess has remained such a great game over the centuries is because of the relative values (approx. 3 pawns each) of the bishop and the knight (which means they can be exchanged for each other during the game) and because of that the game lends itself to rich strategic themes involving the trading of the minor pieces in order to achieve positional advantages. He's an excellent writer (a sort of John Watson lite!). The other writer worth looking at is Jacob Aagaard (Excelling At Chess Everyman is his masterpiece . . . particularly good stuff about rook endings). Now back to the game . . .

I spent quite a bit of time considering this position before realising that it would be rather nice to be able to drop the d4 knight into c6. The knights on d6 and c6 plus the pawn on c5 would mean that black's king was stuck on the a-file.

Obviously I was helped by black's decision to leave his queen on a5 after 8.Bd2 black playing 17...b5 weakening the defence of the king and finally 19...Nxg4 refusing the chance to exchange queens. But in my opinion it all started far earlier trying to get more out of the opening than it really is feasible to expect when playing black (unless you're willing to be black in a Botvinnik Semi-Slav!).

Apparently this is a well known and dubious opening for black where white can safely capture the pawn as its recapture creates havoc worse than losing a pawn.

As to the question of 4.Nxe5 I think we have to put it in a gambit category but unfortunately I answered the wrong question.  3.Nxe5 cannot be considered a gambit as no_genius illustrates with his example of an annotation with it.    I tried looking this position up in the database and was surprised to see that the position here has not only occurred in a rated games setting but occurred fairly frequently ordered below by frequency of occurrence by players where one player is 1600+.  There are even some 1900+ rated players who missed the force of 3.Nxe5.

Seeing it now I have to think that had both players recognized it after the original opportunity play might have proceeded.  I originally said ""This really does eliminate many of the ideas around g5 and f7"" and nuntar adds the following lines as winning for white and I must congratulate him on his analysis:
5.Nxe5!
[A] 5... fxe5 6. Qh5+ [A1]6...Ke7 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Qd5+ [A2]6... g6 7. Qxe5+ forking knight and rook.
[B] 6... Ke7 then 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Qd5+ also picks up the knight as well as putting Black's king in a horrible position; 
[C] 5... Nxc4 6. Qh5+ 
[C1] 6... Ke7 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Nxc4+ Kc5 (or Kc6) 9. Qd5# ""with a nice mid-board mate.""
[C2] 6... g6 7. Nxg6 which Nuntar assesses as ""clearly wins""

All his analysis is spot on for except for his assesment of C2 which is a touch too optimistic but correctly picks white as winning.  The probable continuation --courtesy of iPod Touch's Shredder as 2600 (I cheated)-- point to white as winning:

[C2a] 8.Qxg8 Kf7 9.Qh7+ Bg7 10.f4 Ne7 11.d3 f5 12.Qh8 Where white's pawn structure is superior and black's pieces have been compelled to non-optimal squares.  When the Queen's come off the board Black will have the bishop pair and both knights.  White will have both rooks a pawn advantage a good center and the choice of placing his bishop and knight on squares of his choosing and an exposed black king."

That mate is typically four moves with the same pattern of the bishop on the f7 diagonal and the queen also attacking the square from f3 or h5 and no other pieces are blocking the way of checkmate.

Other moves I was considering were Nc3+ and Qd5+. I chose a4 because if things do not turn out well I always will have my rook open and I can push the a-pawn further. Either way I can always snatch the e5 pawn and the king will take feel like it will never get back to safety without giving anything more.

As long as the white diagonal is closed (and it will stay like that no doubt) I can do moves like this without fear.

Probably my opponent was a little worried to take this path. "

I think this move is intended to compell me to exchange my lsb with the knight since if I defend it with Nf3 after e6 it would have been an easy target."
