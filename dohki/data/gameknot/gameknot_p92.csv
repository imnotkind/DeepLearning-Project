0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I have played enough games against Margeaux to know not to prepare a response to 1. e4. He always opens this way.
1,0,1,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
2,0,2,Ne4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/3Pn3/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',The first sign that 3. e3 was weak. The knight on e4 is strongly placed and white should probably forgo his bishop pair here (7. Bxe4 dxe4) to get rid of it.
3,0,3,c4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p1b2/2PPn3/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - c3',?? 8. ... Nxf2 9. Kxf2 Bxd3 and white loses a pawn. Better was 8. Nh4 to drive away the bishop.
4,0,4,Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/3p1b2/2PPn3/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',??  But thankfully for Margeaux I missed this tactic.
5,0,5,cxd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/3P1b2/3Pn3/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Better probably was 9. Nh4 e6 10. Nxf5 exf5 11. f3 Ng5 after which white has an imposing center and has created doubled pawns for black in exchange for being less developed. White is already trailing in development and 9. cxd5 only exacerbates the issue.
6,0,6,1Ng5,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/2nq2p1/6N1/2BPb3/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',This move re-routes the bishop which threatens and ominous-looking future Qxg2.
7,0,7,1Bd5,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/2nq2p1/3b2N1/2BP4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Note that black has needed to move his king's bishop and knight twice to force black away from the e4 square.
8,0,8,1e4,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/3q2N1/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Margeaux was angry after making this move a clear blunder which loses a valuable central pawn.
9,0,9,1Qb3,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/6N1/3qP3/1Q6/PP3PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Better would be 15. Qxd4 Nxd4 16. Rd1 Nc2 17. Rb1 Rfd8 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Bd4 where white is down a pawn but can probably play for a draw in the endgame.
10,0,10,1Qxb7,b'r4rk1/pQp1ppbp/6p1/4n1N1/3qP3/8/PP3PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',?! Picks up a pawn but removes white's queen from where she is needed most. Better is 16. Be3 which keeps up the tension and prevents 16. ... Nd3 for the time being.
11,0,11,1Be3,b'r4rk1/pQp1ppbp/6p1/6N1/3qP3/3nB3/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',?? A major blunder which shows that Margeaux did not understand the position. The threat of winning the exchange is not the primary use of the d3 but to be involved on the attack on the b2 square. White should have  defended with 17. Re2 Rab8 18. Qd5 Qxd5 19. exd5 Nxb2 20. Bxb2 Bxb2 21. Rxb2 Rxb2 where white is down the exchange and a pawn heading into a torturous endgame. Still this is better than losing a rook outright.
12,0,12,1Rab1,b'r4rk1/pQp1ppbp/6p1/6N1/4P3/3nB3/Pq3PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',?? Margeaux should have exchanged queens. This only makes a bad situation worse.
13,0,13,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p1R1ppbp/6p1/6N1/4P3/4B3/P4PPP/4n1K1 w - -',Here Margeaux resigned. After 21. Rc1 Bb2 22. Rc7 Rfc8 23. Rxc8+ Rxc8 24. Nf3 Nxf3+ 25. gxf3 white's position is in shambles and he is bleeding material.
14,1,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"1....c5 is statistically the best.The Sicilian Defence puts a greater premium on tempo than other replies to 1.e4.I however as I""ve aged I prefer a slower game even giving up opening 1.e4."
15,1,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Exchange Variation of the French defence.Though it has been played by kasparov on occasion it came as a bit of a surprise from my higher rated opponent.More principled and aggressive are 3.Nc3 3.e5 3.Nd2.The gameknot data base also prefers the other moves.

18,1,4,1Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/5N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',14.Bg4 is met by 14....f6 a thematic move for black in the French exchange.
19,1,5,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1q1b4/3p4/3P4/5N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Activating the Queen in preperation for uniting the Rooks.It also fixes whites N to protecting the d pawn ans threatens the b pawn.
20,1,6,1Bc3,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1q1b4/3p4/3P4/2B2N1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I look forward to seeing the GK computers evaluation of this move and feedback from the Masters.I don't like this move and think it may be an inaccuracy by white.I prefer 15.b3
21,1,7,1Bf5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1q1b4/3p1b2/3P4/2B2N1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Seeking active squares for my pieces.Just about here I was quite satisfied with my position.Black has at least a =/+.The position also fits my style better than my other game against Jo where I had a definite white plus out of the opening in a very complicated position.
22,1,8,1Nh4,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1q1b4/3p1b2/3P3N/2B4P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Expected.After blacks best reply 16....Bd7 I hope it proves to be a loss of tempo.
23,1,9,Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1ppp/1q1b4/3p4/3P3N/2B4P/PP3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',"17...Rfe8 contesting the efile. Also preparing f8 for the bishopin the event of a white incursion into f5.
Its about here that I decided I might have the possibility to win against Jo so I decided to switch from a fast moving tempo to correspondence mode like my esteemed opponent.
Though the position looks potentially drawish : (fixed & symetrical pawn positions equal centre control safe k positions and equally contested e file with potential multiple Rook exchanges).
We do have a minor piece imbalance. N/B V Bishop pair though the fixed centre tends to balance them out.
Blacks plan will be to try and provoke weakness on both sides of the board in the hope of utilizing his B pair.
Whites plan to exchange down to a Q/N v Q/B ending where white has the superior piece combination."

26,1,12,1Rxe8+,b'r3R1k1/ppbb1ppp/1q6/3p4/3P3N/2B4P/PP1Q1PP1/R5K1 b - -',I consider this a slight mistake by white as the plan chosen by white leads to the exchange of the major pieces giving black what he wants.Better minor pieces and a low risk position where he gets the chance to grind away at whites position.I think 19.Nf3 was better than if 19....Bf5 than 20.Nh4 seeing if black is ready to repeat positions for the draw.
27,1,13,Rxe1+,b'6k1/ppbb1ppp/1q6/3p4/3P3N/2B4P/PP1Q1PP1/4r1K1 w - -',Avoiding this exchange would favour white.
28,1,14,Qe6,b'6k1/ppbb1ppp/4q3/3p4/3P3N/2B4P/PP3PP1/4Q1K1 w - -',!! Played as a winning attempt and not trading down for a draw against my higher rated opponent.
29,1,15,Bxe6,b'6k1/ppb2ppp/4b3/3p4/3P3N/2B4P/PP3PP1/6K1 w - -',fxe only gives black a weak P on e6 and decreases the mobility of the WSB.

33,1,19,2f3,b'8/ppb2k2/4bp2/3p2pp/3P4/2B2P1P/PP1NK1P1/8 b - -',I think Jo played this to discourage g4 by black or hoping for multiple pawn exchanges on g4.
34,1,20,2h4,b'8/ppb2k2/4bp2/3p2p1/3P3p/2B2P1P/PP1NK1P1/8 w - -',Sticking with the plan of trying to create weaknesses on both sides of the board for the greater mobility of the bishops to exploit.The k side has been weakened now black has to create a weakness on whites Q-side.
35,1,21,2a3,b'8/ppb2k2/4bp2/3p2p1/3P3p/P1B2P1P/1P1NK1P1/8 b - -',I don't like this move as I think white unnecessarily weakens her Q-side.I think b3 may have been better or perhaps leave the pawns as they are at the moment and play Ke3.
36,1,22,2Bd6,b'8/pp3k2/3bbp2/3p2p1/3P3p/P1B2P1P/1P1NK1P1/8 w - -',Played to prevent Bb4 by white but also bettering its own placement as the BSB now bears down on both wings. The alternative plan which I looked at (28.......a5 29.b4 a4 ) may have been betterAny comment from the mentors?

39,1,25,3Nd2,b'8/p4k2/1p1bbp2/3p2p1/3P3p/P1B2P1P/1P1NK1P1/8 b - -',Back to the position of move 29 except for the P on b6 for black and it being blacks move.I think this sequence has favoured black as I don't see b6 as a weakness and its a move to be played in many variations.

The drawback is that black will have to caslte long and the king on c8 won't be safe at all.  To stay on the center will not be safer as the two central pawns are far away from home. As black has 4 pieces out against one for white black has the initiative and it balances the unsafe king position (but may be not the late in material).

And it doesn't prevent black to castle anyway. Furthermore I think theat the fiancheto on g2 would have been the best option for white and it is now more difficult.

Both kings are unsafe (although white can still castle and the black king cannot move on b8). Black is better on the center The semi open file g is under black control black is in late in material White's pawn structure is better but underdevelopped. Black occupates far more field than white.

106,3,34,2Bg4+,b'2kr4/pp5p/5pr1/q7/4p1b1/2P3B1/PP2KPPP/R1Q4R w - -',Better to attack with the bishop than withe the queen (by 22. ... Qb5+) to control the d1 square and because the queen can also come on black squares and the bishop not.

110,4,0,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Caro-Kann again. After Qd5 rather than immediately chase the black queen away white develops other pieces. In this position the black queen IS going to be chased away so white is not worried about doing so immediately.
111,4,1,Qxd3,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Typical mainline trade of the white bishop... I think. There are other more profitable continuations for white in the sense that it takes black out of his preferred strategy since black wants to trade those bishops. Or perhaps creating positional considerations for the bishop trade. But here white is content to simply make that trade.
112,4,2,Nf6,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3q4/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I chose to develop this knight; from this point on I have no idea of what the book Caro-Kann is and develop instinctively. I prefer putting this knight here when there is no white pawn on the e file.
113,4,3,Nc3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3q4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',The black queen is finally chased away.
114,4,4,Qd8,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Karpov used to play the Karo-Cann a bit in blitz games. And often would do this with the queen as other moves can end up wasting tempo's and time.

116,4,6,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',So I remove it.
117,4,7,1h3,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/3P4/2NQ1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b kq -',Qd2 was possible but white had already moved the queen to d3 and did not wish to move the queen again. h3 prevents Ng4 but I'm not so sure moving h3 is wise unless necessary as now the white king's defense is a little weaker.
118,4,8,1h6,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/6B1/3P4/2NQ1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w kq -',H6 to kick the bishop before I castle also I don't want it staying on g5. Nd7 is also possible and perhaps Qc7 or Qb6; however I did not like any of the queen moves in this position as I ultimately don't think they will work in this position. Often white can sacrifice on h6 but in this position it appears to me that white is not really set up to do so; and doesn't in the ensuing moves. I am still not developed all the way and want to not just castle by rote here; let white guess a bit. But I have to be careful not to wait too long.
119,4,9,Nbd7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P1B2/2NQ1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w kq -',This is to prevent Bxb8. Since the light squared bishops are off the board sometimes an imbalance of two knights verse a knight and a bishop is better especially if the pawns are mostly still on the board. Yes the bishop can cover the board more quickly but two knights can work very well together and the pawns can hem the bishop in so it depends on the position. I did not want white to make that particular trade. Besides this is typically where the queen's knight goes anyways.
120,4,10,1Rfe1,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P1B2/2NQ1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b kq -',Now the pressure is increasing some on the black king; white is gearing up his pieces here. However he does not make decisive decisions... how's that for a phrase? And so black weathers the pressure but it lasts a looong time. Play continued.
121,4,11,1Nd5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/3n4/3P1B2/2NQ1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w kq -',Normally I don't like making this move with no other piece able to retake but a pawn as one strategy of the Caro-Kann is to try to keep d5 for an outpost. However white's pieces are beginning to become coordinated and so I decide to lessen some of the tension.
122,4,12,cxd5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/4p2p/3p4/3P1B2/3Q1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w kq -',In this position this is the only move. Taking with the e pawn would be a bad idea as the black bishop has few defenders.
123,4,13,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/4p2p/3pN3/3P1B2/3Q3P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b kq -',I should not have allowed this position; the white knight can be dangerous there. Nxf7 and Ng6 were white prepared to make those moves could prove unpleasant. For example were white allowed to Nxf7 Kxf7 Qf3 and the black king must retreat; but Kg8 is very unpleasant and Ke8 is just dangerous after Rxe6. I have one move to make before white can consider it so I do what I think will not allow white enough compensation to make such a move. ::edited:: Yes black can move the knight to f6 instead of moving the king but it just seems dangerous to keep having pieces tied up on defense allowing white more initiative and the white rooks would quickly be able to add pressure down the e file if I chose that. So as I said...::
124,4,14,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4p2p/3pN3/3P1B2/3Q3P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',About time I castled. If white still had three minor pieces or  if white's rooks were positioned to support the kingside black would be in a dangerous position. Now however the move h3 made by white some moves ago makes it more difficult to get both rooks involved quickly and I think black will be able to defend just fine. White however still has the initiative.
125,4,15,1c3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4p2p/3pN3/3P1B2/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I don't like this move. Yes it shores up the d4 pawn but why now? I think white should have considered something more threatening to black... and designed to keep black on his heels.
126,4,16,1Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/4p2p/3pn3/3P1B2/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',I was curious which piece he would retake here with. I did not want to let white initiate the trades when he was ready to so... begone knight! That white knight was unpleasant for black.
127,4,17,1Bxe5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/4p2p/3pB3/3P4/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',White chose to recapture with the bishop rather than the pawn or rook. Either of the other two would have been interesting; but the bishop recapture seems a little passive to me because it delays other tactics on h6 and doesn't seem to give white any additional pressure.
128,4,18,1Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pp1/4pb1p/3pB3/3P4/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',Now whether or not I take with the bishop depends on how white's plan develops as indicated by his moves. I am still trying to equalize. Some may say it looks equal but white up to the last couple moves had maintained an initiative. I am close to changing that. White's attack has really evaporated now.
129,4,19,1Qg3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pp1/4pb1p/3pB3/3P4/2P3QP/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',I have time before the white rooks get involved in an attempt to threaten the black king. I am already looking ahead to my counter play on the queenside; after a short think I decide to move the Rook to where I think it will do the most good. When queenside play begins notice how the black rook moves and black queen position result in an advantage for black. I could not at this point know what my opponent would do but after considering the possibilities thought that the c file would become open before long.
130,4,20,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pp3pp1/4pb1p/3pB3/3P4/2P3QP/PP3PP1/R3R1K1 w - -',So I moved the a file rook to the half- open c file. As I said in the last comment notice that I just did not do this because that's what you do. I thought of what would likely happen and what I would be doing. The white bishop was not the deciding factor for me either; had I wanted the rook on the b file the bishops would have come off first. Just about all of the time putting rooks on open files or half-open files is the right thing to do. But it's good to consider what you'll do there!
131,4,21,1f4,b'2rq1rk1/pp3pp1/4pb1p/3pB3/3P1P2/2P3QP/PP4P1/R3R1K1 b - f3',Further weakening the white king and I don't see how this will really help white. Either he moves f5 in which case I still have three pawns covering my king or he retakes with the f pawn if a bishop trade is initiated by me; but the resulting half open f file has not been prepared yet by white to control it. So I don't see what white's point is here especially with his one rook woefully biding time in a corner like a disobedient child on time-out.
132,4,22,1b5,b'2rq1rk1/p4pp1/4pb1p/1p1pB3/3P1P2/2P3QP/PP4P1/R3R1K1 w - b6',Now is the right time to prepare a queen side counter. Minority pawn attack!!

134,4,24,1a5,b'2rq1rk1/5pp1/4pb1p/pp1pB3/3P1P2/P1P3QP/1P4P1/R3R1K1 w - a6',I have you now Luke! Err umm... just deleted his name. ;) Actually I think he hasn't played much against the Caro-Kann as his moves are not as precise as I've faced on occasion. Well neither are my responses to be fair. ;) My intent right now is to riddle the queen side full of holes distracting white from his kingside plans and then whatever white pawn is left gang up on it. The white kingside is very weak now and if the game goes that way I'll have a lot of opportunities on that kingside. But we'll see here...
135,4,25,2Rac1,b'2rq1rk1/5pp1/4pb1p/pp1pB3/3P1P2/P1P3QP/1P4P1/2R1R1K1 b - -',Now white sees what is in store for the c file and decides not to allow it. Well he hasn't looked deep enough yet!
136,4,26,2Rc6,b'3q1rk1/5pp1/2r1pb1p/pp1pB3/3P1P2/P1P3QP/1P4P1/2R1R1K1 w - -',Setting up the back rank for the other rook to move to the c file or elsewhere as conditions warrant. The black queen will support queenside operations as needed and perhaps reposition more than once but we'll see.
137,4,27,2Qd3,b'3q1rk1/5pp1/2r1pb1p/pp1pB3/3P1P2/P1PQ3P/1P4P1/2R1R1K1 b - -',I thought he might do that... and now I feel as if I have wrested the initiative firmly away from white.
138,4,28,2Bxe5,b'3q1rk1/5pp1/2r1p2p/pp1pb3/3P1P2/P1PQ3P/1P4P1/2R1R1K1 w - -',So I decide now is the time to get rid of the bishops as white's bishop's position was simply worth more than mine. Oh I hear the screams now: White's bishop is a 'bad' bishop. But black's bishop is doing nothing at all while white's is supported and threatening. And if things are opened up I don't think there will be a decisive bishop comparatively speaking. Yes I recognize that I could have moved Be7 but the white bishop can't be trapped f5 would follow. I don't really want while pursuing my queenside counter to weaken my king's defenses. So the bishops can give each other last rites: be gone. Now white can try to win a pawn by interposing Qxb5 in response to black's Bxe5 and then we have an interesting position: black can move Rb6 and if Qxa5 black could move Bxf4 saving the bishop at the expense of connected passed white pawns on the queenside or move Bxd4+. Would the black bishop be worth the connected white pawns or would it be better to isolate the white a and d file pawns? (...Rxb2 would follow the bishop retake) It's an interesting question. I wish I had a computer engine to crunch it. But white retakes the black bishop immediately.
139,4,29,Qb6,b'5rk1/5pp1/1qr1p2p/pp1pP3/3P4/P1PQ3P/1P4P1/2R1R1K1 w - -',Well I wish white would have tried the interposing; it would have made for a far more interesting game. Now however black is well positioned to continue the minority pawn attack. White senses things are going to open up a bit and hides his king.
140,4,30,2Kh2,b'5rk1/5pp1/1qr1p2p/pp1pP3/3P4/P1PQ3P/1P4PK/2R1R3 b - -',But I don't like this move here because white doesn't have much time... and I'm not referring to game time but tempo!
141,4,31,2b4,b'5rk1/5pp1/1qr1p2p/p2pP3/1p1P4/P1PQ3P/1P4PK/2R1R3 w - -',And so I attack the majority pawns!
142,4,32,2Rxc1,b'5rk1/5pp1/1q2p2p/p2pP3/1P1P4/P2Q3P/1P4PK/2R5 b - -',White must retake.
143,4,33,2a4,b'5rk1/5pp1/1q2p2p/3pP3/Pp1P4/3Q3P/1P4PK/2R5 b - -',A sneaky try. Immediately I play b3. Were white allowed to support that passed pawn such an advantage could prove to be a winning one in an endgame where the black king must travel all the way to the side of the board to stop it. And it would be hard and likely impossible for black to remove such support once it was done. I cannot allow white to play b3 period.
144,4,34,Rb8,b'1r4k1/5pp1/1q2p2p/3pP3/P2P4/1pRQ3P/1P4PK/8 w - -',And lo white is totally out of position to protect the a pawn and black's piece coordination is much better. Look how white controls the c file but in this position it's not so important! ;) Play continues.
145,4,35,2g4,b'1r4k1/5pp1/1q2p2p/3pP3/P2P2P1/1pRQ3P/1P5K/8 b - g3',This move is very bad for white and the only real blunder by my opponent. Those pawns aren't going anywhere and grabbing space at this point at the expense of king cover/safety is a mistake.
146,4,36,2Qb4,b'1r4k1/5pp1/4p2p/3pP3/Pq1P2P1/1pRQ3P/1P5K/8 w - -',The a pawn is already dead but doesn't know it yet.
147,4,37,2a5,b'1r4k1/5pp1/4p2p/P2pP3/1q1P2P1/1pRQ3P/1P5K/8 b - -',A good try. However this leads to a combination that proves to be the winning one. See if you can spot it it's pretty easy.
148,4,38,2Qxa5,b'1r4k1/5pp1/4p2p/q2pP3/3P2P1/1pRQ3P/1P5K/8 w - -',Qxa5!

151,4,41,3Qxb3,b'6k1/5pp1/4p2p/q2pP3/3P2P1/1Q5P/1P5K/8 b - -',Qxb3 and now after a check the d pawn falls:
152,4,42,Qxd4,b'6k1/5pp1/4p2p/3pP3/3q2P1/1Q4KP/1P6/8 w - -',White has no choice now and must protect e5. He is able to with tempo since I left my king on the back rank because of the b1-h7 diagonal being unobstructed.
153,4,43,3Kg2,b'1Q6/5ppk/4p2p/3pP3/3q2P1/7P/1P4K1/8 b - -',This move just did not seem wise now. Black will not try to force a queen trade due to the fact that the b file pawn ought to be sent towards queening immediately. Black cannot stop the b pawn with his king; and by the time black orchestrates a queen trade on the b8-h2 diagonal the b pawn will be unstoppable. Therefore black will not try to make such a trade at all but must either queen first perpetually check or lose. It turns out black can queen first. White will lose a tempo regardless when black moves his queen from obstructing his own passed pawn no matter if the white king is on g3 or g2 for black will move with check. The same cannot be said for the white queen unless it's to allow the black king to take it on g8 or h8. So the next several moves could become a pawn race and black has the upper hand! Notice how black has kept a pawn advantage and has seized the initiative from white by that minority pawn attack. I wonder if white considered resigning here.
154,4,44,3h5,b'1Q6/5ppk/4p3/3pP2p/3q2P1/7P/1P4K1/8 w - -',This move was a mistake by me. 'nuff said. Well okay; here's how it was a mistake: if white were to find a way to check from c2 with the white pawn still on e5 black would wish to avoid a perpetual and perhaps even move g6. But with a white pawn on h5 that could be a bit problematic. Also it's rather a waste of time doing nothing immediately to force the game unless I were trying for a draw. Why did I do it during play? At the time I was thinking if the queens were off the board this could make it easier for those white pawns to fall. And it would. But now it seems obvious that all I did was waste time and weaken my own king's position.
155,4,45,3gxh5,b'1Q6/5ppk/4p3/3pP2P/3q4/7P/1P4K1/8 b - -',White responds. That response... was it really necessary or was there something better for white? White thought so. But anyways now we get down to brass tacks so to speak.
156,4,46,3Qe4+,b'1Q6/5ppk/4p3/3pP2P/4q3/7P/1P4K1/8 w - -',Whether e4 or e3 the white king was going to be checked.
157,4,47,3Kf2,b'1Q6/5ppk/4p3/3pP2P/4q3/7P/1P3K2/8 b - -',A gallant try but ultimately gives me more tempos; there is no good way for white to stop the d pawn just as that b pawn would be mighty hard for me to stop if I needed to.
158,4,48,3Qb5,b'8/5ppk/4p3/1Q2P2P/3pq3/7P/1P3K2/8 b - -',White has realized he cannot win a simple pawn race and after a few ineffectual queen moves resigns. White's queen is currently 'overloaded' that is it has too much to do and can't do it all. White needs to protect the e pawn on e5 prevent black from picking off the other white pawns when opportunity arises and even more importantly needs to stop the d pawn. Oh and also support queening that passed b pawn. It would seem she doesn't have time to do it all; the position is extremely difficult for any white chances including drawing. There may be a chance that white could have orchestrated a queen trade where the white king finishes off the d pawn. To summarize: in this position White probably needed to some how get the queens off the board blockade black pawn advances with his king and advance the b pawn to the eighth rank in order to win. I am not envying white here!
159,4,49,Qe2+,b'8/5ppk/4p3/Q3P2P/8/3p3P/1P2qK2/8 w - -',And this was the position where white resigned. I hope this proves the value of a minority pawn attack in busting up a majority of pawns and creating counterplay that in this game proved decisive. Any comments appreciated!

This game came from Dennis Hebblnyck's THEM Tournaments which are a correspondence chess site which is not related to Gameknot.  This game is THEM27-34 FRITZ GAMBIT (known as The Grob on Gameknot).  My opponent is Guy Shelmerdine.  Because of the involvement in the Club I ended up taking too long over responding to Guy's moves.  Thankfully Guy decided to join Gameknot and we finished our games on Gameknot.  This is the first of a best of two.  I won by 1.5 - 0.5 on aggregate.  So I kick off with the thematic 1. g4 of which my opponent responds d5 and I play Bg2 and my opponent then takes on g4."
199,7,1,c4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq c3',3. c4 - I decided to undermine the pawn on d5 and black defends with Nf6.
200,7,2,Nxd5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',4. ..... Nxd5 - pawn trade.

202,7,4,Qb3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',7. Qb3 - I now decide to put pressure on b7.  Guy then makes a big mistake.  Glenda has been eyeing up the square a4 and has been itching to fork the BK and the bishop on g4.  However that prelate or the Witch can interpose on d7 and either way the bishop is protected.  However ......
203,7,5,e6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/3p4/6b1/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',1. ..... e6 ?? - this move blocks that diagonal.  There is no way for black to play those moves which will avoid being a piece for pawn down.  Now Glenda takes a jump to the left and then six steps to the right and the black prelate on g4 finds himself doing that timewarp in the sky!
204,7,6,Bc5,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2bp4/6Q1/8/PP1PPPBP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',9. ..... Bc5 - black keeps his king upright and puts up a terrific fight for another 30 moves or so.  As he has decided to play on he must get his pieces out asap and mount an attack on Henry.  I must be alert to this and clear my own decks as quickly as possible.
205,7,7,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2bp4/6Q1/P4N2/1P1PPPBP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',11. a3 - to prevent Nb4.

All the Witch needs is a few black pawns and even the BK to help her so I must still take care.  However I have to do something else black may be able to get away with a draw.

220,7,22,4Kf4,b'8/4k3/p7/2P2B2/2pp1K2/P7/1P6/8 b - -',42. Kf4 - Henry has caught the smell of his favourite nosh!  P(r)awns!  He wants them with piri-piri sauce today!
221,7,23,4Ke4,b'3k4/8/p7/2P5/2p1K1B1/P2p4/1P6/8 b - -',44. Ke4 - Henry is gonna clean up those juicy p(r)awns on c4 and d3.  Guy sees this and waves the white flag.  In our next game Guy gets his revenge.
222,8,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sicilian Defence: very popular.
223,8,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is called the 'Kopec' Variation of the Sicilian.   I very rarely play anything else on move two in this line but 2...Nc6 is quite popular and playable whilst 2...e6 I occasionally employ and 2...Nf6 and 2...g7 are playable lines.
224,8,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Unusual at this point.  White keeps his options open whether to play and Open or Closed Sicilian.  The most popular 'Open' line is usually heralded by 3.d4 cxd4  4.Nxd4 Nf6  5.Nc3.  But Black declines to play 3...Nf6 with the possibility of transposing on account of 4.e5 - an annoying advance.
225,8,3,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Opting for something Dragon-like.  The GK engine doesn't like this move preferring 3...Nf6  4.d4 cxd4 and transposing onto normal 'open' lines. But White could as well play 4.Bb5ch.  The move played is a little provocative but in my opinion playable enough.
226,8,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Actually not bad!  White figures that Black might be reluctant to play 4...e6 and in fact I was.  That pawn advance is OK enough but I prefer to hold it back for now.  At that 4...e5 would also have been playable for Black here. 
227,8,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Calmly continuing as planned.  Would White take on f7 right now?  I didn't think it likely...
228,8,6,Bxf7+,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2pBbp/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',(?) I guess the thing had to be tested but after this White never quite gets enough attack.  I was half-expecting 5.Ng5 when I might well have played 5...e6.  This Bishop sac disrupts Black's King position but the advantages that accrues aren't enough to square against the loss of the Bishop.  Very occasionally this kind of thing works.  Not this time.
229,8,7,Kxf7,b'rnbq2nr/pp2pkbp/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -','Show me.'  When examining moves by an opponent to involve him in the loss of material always take into account he might be on to something good.  But to suppose is not to assume.  If you can't find that your opponent can recoup his material make him 'show you'.  If he can't then you have the material advantage.  Here Black really has no choice but to take.
230,8,8,Ng5+,b'rnbq2nr/pp2pkbp/3p2p1/2p3N1/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I'm guessing White wanted to get in this check and hence beef up the pressure on f7 whilst the getting was good.  First off it makes way for the Queen to get into the game and allows Black no time to keep him out by ...h6.
231,8,9,Ke8,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2p3N1/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Chosen to keep the f8-square open for the rook.
232,8,10,Nd5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pN2N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I'm guessing that White wanted to have something to play against the Black knight that would soon be landing on f6...

234,8,12,Nxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2p1b1/3p2pp/2pn4/4P3/5Q1N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now the pressure on f7 has eased off Black exchanges off White's most active piece.
235,8,13,Rf8,b'rnbqkr2/pp2p1b1/3p2pp/2pP4/8/5Q1N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Now he 'develops' a rook along the half-open f-file.  True g6 is a tender point but that can be plastered over...
236,8,14,Bf5,b'rn1qkr2/pp2p1b1/3p2pp/2pP1b2/8/6QN/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Protecting g6 with a secondary objective: the pawn at c2.

A piece behind White will find it hard to develop enough resources to penetrate.  All the same he does get quite close to the Black King eventually...
240,8,18,1d4,b'r2qkr2/pp1np3/3p2pp/2pPbb2/3P1N2/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - d3',A pawn sac possibly hoping to deflect Black's dark-square bishop (DSB).  But Black doesn't mind doubled pawns in a good cause.  Probably 14.d3 was better.

242,8,20,1Nc5,b'r2qkr2/pp2p3/3p2pp/2nPbb2/3p1N1Q/8/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',According to plan.  But I looked pretty long at 14..Nf6 as well...
243,8,21,1Re1,b'r2qkr2/pp2p3/3p2pp/2nPbb2/3p1N1Q/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Just as well.  16.Qxh6 would have lost the Queen: 16...Rh8  17.Qg5 Ne4 and the attacked Queen has no escape.
244,8,22,1Qb6,b'r3kr2/pp2p3/1q1p2pp/2nPbb2/3p1N1Q/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Eyeing f2 and b2 both but also with the view of bring the King to safety betimes.

So localised is White's attack Black can now ignore it.  But see how Black has mobilised all his pieces and is attacking all across the board.  White's 2-piece fighting corps is unable to broaden its attack and lacks time to call up the last reserve the rook at a1.  Already a rook behind anyway Black is in effect playing two rooks down.

284,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a long draw where I think we both missed a lot of chances so hopefully it will be instructive to analyse it.  This is a fast ladder game against a tricky opponent against whom I have an uneven record ...We open with his usual brand of Sicilian characterised by 2...Nc6.

288,10,4,1Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/1pb2ppp/p1npbn2/4p1B1/1P2P3/P1N2PP1/2P1N1BP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Played to inhibit Black from advancing the N or d-pawn and to encourage Black to weaken the squares around his K with ...h6

292,10,8,Qxd5,b'r4rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/3qp3/1P6/P3QPP1/2P1N1BP/R4RK1 w - -',Following the series of exchanges Black has the stronger looking position but his Q is vulnerable to attack.

295,10,11,2Qc4,b'r4rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/4p3/1Pq5/P3QPP1/2PRN1BP/5RK1 w - -',I assume he was worried about 22. c3 revealing an attack on his Q but then he could have nicked the a-pawn.  It was probably better to contest the d-file with a rook immediately.
296,10,12,2Rfd1,b'r4rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/4p3/1Pq5/P3QPP1/2PRN1BP/3R2K1 b - -',Now to me my position looks much nicer than after move 19.  The computer evaluated them the other way round though.
297,10,13,2Rab8,b'1r3rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/4p3/1Pq5/P3QPP1/2PRN1BP/3R2K1 w - -',Here the computer advocates immedate action with 22..a5 followed by swaps of pawns and queens eventually giving black a pawn advantage.  The move played does get the rook off the long diagonal where it was potentially attacked by the fianchettoed bishop and prepares the advance of the b-pawn which will block White's pawns.
298,10,14,2f4,b'1r3rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/4p3/1Pq2P2/P3Q1P1/2PRN1BP/3R2K1 b - -',When eventually I do play this the computer prefers 23. Nc3 where it would be imposing defensive duties on my Q.  I still prefer 23. f4 opening my diagonal and attacking Black's centre.
299,10,15,2Qxf4,b'1r3rk1/1p3pp1/p1n1b2p/8/1Pq2Q2/P5P1/2PRN1BP/3R2K1 b - -',Here 24. Nxf4 might have been better.  The N is somewhat feeble on e2.

301,10,17,2Qxc4,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/p3b2p/1p6/1PQ5/P5P1/2PR2BP/3R2K1 b - -',I didn't think my Q could wreak any more havoc than his and I had long term hopes of capitalising on my Q-side pawn majority and my doubled rooks so I decided to swap here.
302,10,18,2Bxc4,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6p/1p6/1Pb5/P5P1/2PR2BP/3R2K1 w - -',A nice outpost for his B.
303,10,19,2Bd5,b'1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6p/1p1B4/1Pb5/P5P1/2PR3P/3R2K1 b - -',So I decided to swap it off immediately possibly also disrupting his pawns.  However my B was really stronger than his so perhaps I should have kept them on and improved the position of my King with 28. Kf2 covering the square e2.
304,10,20,Rb6,b'4r1k1/5pp1/pr5p/1p1R4/1P6/P5P1/2P4P/3R2K1 w - -',Presumably preparing to double on the e-file or slide around on the 3rd rank and defend his backward a-pawn.  The computer prefers 29. Rbc8 immediately attacking my c-pawn which does look stronger.
305,10,21,3Rc1,b'4r1k1/5pp1/pr5p/1p1R4/1P6/P5P1/2P4P/2R3K1 b - -',Preparing to push the c-pawn.  The computer prefers me to keep my rooks doubled and offer to swap with 30. Rd6 which it evaluates as dead even.
306,10,22,3Rd4,b'4r1k1/5pp1/p1r4p/1p6/1P1R4/P5P1/2P4P/2R3K1 b - -',Now the immediate 31. c4 would have been better.  After the rooks swap on c4 Black wouldn't be able to hold on to his extra pawn for long.
307,10,23,3Re2,b'6k1/5pp1/p1r4p/1p6/1P1R4/P5P1/2P1r2P/2R3K1 w - -',Black occupies his 7th rank - always a good thing to do - and puts a double attack on the c-pawn - but that was about to move anyway.  Perhaps attacking White's a-pawn immediately was the better way to go.
308,10,24,3Rc3,b'6k1/5pp1/p1r4p/1p6/1PPR4/P1R3P1/r6P/6K1 b - -',Not as good as creating a passed pawn on c5.
309,10,25,3Rd1,b'6k1/5pp1/p3r2p/1p6/1PP5/P1R3P1/r6P/3R2K1 b - -',The computer prefers 34. Kf1 allowing Black to double rooks along White's 2nd rank  deliver several checks and snaffle the h-pawn.  I preferred to stop the classic 2-rook mate by pulling my rook back to the back rank.  Black will still be able to double on my second rank but I hope I'll be able to limit the damage.
310,10,26,Rxa3,b'6k1/5pp1/p3r2p/8/1PR5/r5P1/7P/3R2K1 w - -',I hadn't meant to drop this pawn though ...
311,10,27,3Rc5,b'6k1/5pp1/p3r2p/2R5/1P6/r5P1/7P/3R2K1 b - -',Preparing to block Black's pawn on a5 I think.  The b-pawn is now undefended and could have been quickly won by Black. 
312,10,28,3Rdd4,b'6k1/5pp1/pr5p/8/1PRR4/1r4P1/7P/6K1 b - -',A strange place to double rooks but the pawn is still there!
313,10,29,Rxa5,b'3R4/5ppk/7p/r7/2R5/1r4P1/6KP/8 w - -',Black could have inserted a couple of checks here enabling him to improve his position before taking the pawn.
314,10,30,4Rd7,b'8/3R1ppk/7p/r7/2R5/1r4P1/6KP/8 b - -',and before attacking the f-pawn I should have blocked access to my King by retreating the c-rook to c2.
315,10,31,4Rh4,b'8/3R1ppk/7p/7r/7R/6PK/1r5P/8 b - -',The danger to my h-pawn forces me to allow the rook swap.
316,10,32,4gxh4,b'8/3R1ppk/7p/8/7P/7K/1r5P/8 b - -',Now Black has a passed f-pawn and I have virtually useless doubled h-pawns.
317,10,33,4Kg3,b'8/3R2pk/5p1p/8/7P/6K1/1r5P/8 b - -',An immediate 46. h5 would have held Black's King h- and g-pawns back.
318,10,34,4Rd6,b'8/6p1/3R1p1k/7p/7P/1r5P/6K1/8 b - -',Now I think I still have drawing chances if I can just frustrate Black long enough with pins and checks along the ranks - Black has to prove his win as I'm not going to give up without a fight.  The computer evaluats the position over the next dozen moves as Black being slightly more than 2 pawns up but no more than that.
319,10,35,f4+,b'8/6k1/R5p1/7p/4rp1P/6KP/8/8 w - -',No comment from the computer but the evaluation drops to -1.49 with this move.
320,10,36,6Kxf4,b'8/6k1/R5p1/7p/5K1P/4r2P/8/8 b - -',But this is a mistake: Black can now mop up my two pawns.  I should have just retreated to g2 and continued with my harrassment strategy.
321,10,37,6Kg5,b'8/6k1/R5p1/6Kp/7P/7r/8/8 b - -',The computer would have played the nice drawing trap here of 65. Ra4 Rxh4+ 66. Kg5 Rxa4?? Stalemate.  I didn't spot it.
322,10,38,6Kf4,b'8/6k1/R5p1/7p/5K1P/6r1/8/8 b - -',The computer evaluation now gives Black 3.5 pawns advantage.
323,10,39,Kh6,b'8/R7/6pk/7p/7r/5K2/8/8 w - -',Now it's 4 pawns advantage.  If only the computer had a longer event horizon I think it would have been predicting a forced win for Black here.
324,10,40,h4+,b'8/8/5r1k/6p1/1R5p/6K1/8/8 w - -',A mistake allowing White to settle his King on g4 preventing the pawns from advancing further.  Black should first have freed up his Rook for checking action from (e.g.) the d-file.
325,10,41,7Kh3,b'8/8/5r1k/6p1/1R5p/7K/8/8 b - -',But White returns the favour increasing Black's advantage to 5.  g4 was the right square preventing Black's King from advancing yet.
326,10,42,Kg4,b'8/8/8/1R4p1/6kp/5r2/6K1/8 w - -',?  Black tries to throw the win away!
327,10,43,8Rb4+,b'8/8/8/6p1/1R4kp/5r2/6K1/8 b - -',But White misses the opportunity: I could have got my draw immediately with 80. Rxg5+!! Kxg5 81. Kxf3 Kf5 82. Kg2 and I stop the pawn from queening by shuffling around on g1 and h1.
328,10,44,8Rc3,b'8/8/8/8/4rkpp/2R5/6K1/8 b - -',Apparently a blunder that should have allowed Black to queen.  The computer evaluates the position after this move as -13.34. Instead I should have retreated to the second rank and switched to a policy of checks from front and rear: 84. Rb2 Rd4 85. Rf2+ Kg5 86. Rf8 h3+ 87. Kh2 Rd2+ 88. Kg1 g3 89. Rg8+ Kf4 90. Rf8+ etc resulting in an evaluation of -5.21.
329,10,45,8h3+,b'8/8/8/8/4rkp1/2R4p/6K1/8 w - -',"In the line given by the computer at White's previous ""blunder"" the computer gave this move as the correct continuation.  But the evaluation after this move has reverted to -5.21: presumably another stark example of its event horizon.  Whatever an advantage of 5.21 should enable Black to win from here."
330,10,46,Re2+,b'8/8/8/8/5kp1/2R4p/4r2K/8 w - -',and now the computer announces Mate in 12.
331,10,47,h2+,b'8/8/8/8/5kp1/2R5/4r2p/6K1 w - -',But this is not the way to deleiver it only evaluating to -7.52 ....  86...g3 was the correct move.
332,10,48,g3,b'8/8/8/8/5k2/2R3p1/4r2p/7K w - -',?? enabling White to win the g-pawn or draw immediately with 88. Rxg3 Kxg3 stalemate.  The rook is immune to capture while White's King is trapped in the corner and to free it up to move Black will probably have to give up the other pawn as well.
333,10,49,8Rc4+,b'8/8/8/8/2R2k2/6p1/4r2p/7K b - -',?? unfortunately I didn't spot it yet.

If you go to the games database you'll notice that there are only 4 listed responses for this position.  As for the position itself it doesn't do much for center control but does allow the opportunity to play a hyper-modern game; controlling the center from the wings.

I should have used this opportunity to develop another piece.  Granted I had my eye on the potential Ne2 so I wanted to develop the bishop to avoid barricading it but Ne2 wasn't necessary and in the end I didn't play it anyway.  The Bishop could have been developed later (and to potentially a better square).

I can't remember the last time I played a game where I developed both Bishops before either Knight Freddy forced this in my mind because I saw 5. Nf3 g4 6. Nd2 cxd4.  Either way a Knight couldn't defend the challenged piece without losing the e5 pawn.  The only other option was 5. c3.

From Freddy's advice ""A good way to improve is not trying to win but trying to last as long as possible. The goal is to make it to move 100+ in any game. A longer game can give you a opportunitys to change from trying to last to trying to win.""  I have noticed in the past that to be very true by deferring exchanges and prolonging things opportunities do present themselves.  I also learned that Freddy's Bishops are deadly.  Lastly I've learned (finally I hope) that getting pieces developed against masters is of the utmost importance.  For some reason I tend to forget the basics when I match with players who are better than me but I should always try to remember that they are still flesh and blood human beings and they can make mistakes too.  Computers take the personality right out of these matches."

It has been a while since I annotated a game.  I will copy this into both David Patron's and Charleshiggie's group for both Mentors to read and I will also create a thread about Damiano's Defense in my Unusual Openings Series.  In this game for black it all ends quickly - alas for him in my favour.  So how did this happen?  Well just sit back and watch ....."
372,12,1,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. ..... f6?! - this is the move which characterises the Damiano's Defense.  Damiano analysed this move in the 1500s and he was far from happy with the outcome.  This opening however as a result of this demo became permanently associated with this unfortunate Italian dude.
373,12,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',3. Nxe5 - this is Damiano's Gambit.  If it is accepted then you have three choices. 1. Drop the exchange 2. Play into a line called the Five Pawns Gambit - funnily enough there was an expert called Sam Sloan who managed to win the game playing black despite being 5 pawns adrift or c. run into Old Matey.  Hmm I don't think any of these choices are palatable although I will show you the link below of Sam Sloan's victory with the 5 pawns gambit.
374,12,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3pN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',"3. ..... d5 - an unusual response to my sacrifice.  He doesn't take the knight but this move is just as bad.  Better is the Macgregor/Chigorin Variation with 3. .... Qe7.  At least this gets the pawn back but it does leave the Wicked Witch of the West a little vulnerable particularly after white castles as you will see in my game ""Damiano's Defanged"" against dmaestro.  As a result of this d5 move Chris is now gonna get a visit from Glenda!"

Any non-checking move from Glenda will result in that fork on c2.  I could leave her where she is because at least she is defended by Fou Lenoir after I play Na3.  Still now that I am a rook up it is better to trade the remaining major pieces.

Both black knights are skewered by my rook and only one can be saved.  13. ..... c5 does not cut the mustard because I can still win the knight on d4 with the pawn stab c3.  Black already 6 points down in material will therefore be the equivalent of a whole queen behind.  Chris decided that was just too much.  Ah well time to create that thread!

The Sicilian is not an opening for the faint hearted.  Defense and passivitis will get you nowhere in the middlegame!  Well I can tell you that neither player showed much passivitis in the middlegame.  However unfortunately for my opponent small-potato a bigger concentration of white pieces in his position at the right time ensured that it was not Henry that was to topple.  In this game much to black's chagrin Glenda snapped out of her defensive role and became one hot potato!  So how did all this happen?  Well let's kick off with 1. e4 c4.  This is the Sicilian Defense and the word defense is a misnomer because both sides may end up being at each other's throats."

Now if the two sides castle on the opposite side (white normally queenside) then I am aware of the fact that Henry can be subject to an almighty barrage down the a-c columns by major pieces and they can all line up neatly behind the pushed pawns.  So somehow I must counter-attack vigorously on the kingside and get my punch in first.

690,21,21,3Rxe7+,b'8/3kRQ1p/r2n4/6P1/1pp1P3/8/pPq1N2P/K2R4 b - -',32. Rxe7+ - I felt more comfortable about this move because at least black can be checked along the second rank and there is a possibility of a lawn-mower mate.  Black now waves the white flag.  Gameknot analysis showed that I had a forced mate in a few moves.  After conceding that Low Draw in the Grob game I was quite relieved to get four of the ten points back and to do it in such an aggressive fashion after my usual diet of passivitis is really something.  I will have another annotation coming soon so watch this space.  Kind regards - Joanne

Its your ONLY real mistake of the game other moves may not have been the best but this is the one that kills you. Perhaps b-h3 looking at advancing the g pawn or b-d1 though thats a very negative move. I would have played b-h3 as black has no g pawn to threaten you.

There was an early transposition in my opening and a really unorthodox and risky opening for black. I took the center and almost came off with a pretty big advantage due to black's opening of both his kingside and queenside and lack of development however I messed it up and soon onward the rest of the game favored black with some blunders on my part.
Constructive comments are welcome on this game."
717,24,1,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq h6',Unorthodox opening. My instinct is to claim the center.
718,24,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/8/7p/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',I've decided now for simple classical development.

720,24,4,1h4,b'rnbqkbnr/2p5/p3pp2/1p4p1/3PP2p/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',A compensation for his lack of minor-piece activity: he has a pretty threatening pawn presence on my kingside with his rook and minor pieces right behind them. At the time I wasn't convinced that this mattered though black was able to pull it through in the end.

724,24,8,1Qd5+,b'rnbq2nr/2p1b3/p3k1B1/1p1QPpp1/7p/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I got overconfident here looking at a checkmate but actually just forced a queen trade that would leave me behind in material. The other line I'm seeing is 15. Qb3+ Kd7 (forced because the only other move is ...Qd5 winning the black queen and checkmate as well) 16. Qd5+ Bd6 (again forced) 17. Qxa8 leaving me a full rook ahead. I don't think my queen would be trapped at that point.
725,24,9,2Bd5+,b'rnb3nr/1kp1b3/p7/1p1BPpp1/8/4BN1p/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',Here again I thought I could pull off a checkmate but I'm successfully defended against. And now there's a pawn messing with my king's defense. It's at this point that the game starts to turn against me.
726,24,10,2Bf7,b'rnb3nr/1k2bB2/p1p5/1p2Ppp1/8/4BN1p/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',Perhaps it would have been better to move my bishop out of danger.

In retrospect at several points in the game it looked (superficially anyway) like I might have been able to pull off checkmate. In the short analysis I did it doesn't actually look like a checkmate would have happened as a result of the positions (around move 15 and again at move 20) because black was able to adequately defend. However if I hadn't blundered in the queen exchange and in underestimating black's h-pawn the game could have been in my favor as a result of black's questionable (in my opinion) opening."
732,25,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',We begin with a Slav Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined.  I'm no expert on this line but from what I've seen of it I wish I knew a lot more about it.  One of the more combative lines at Black's disposal.
733,25,1,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',A fairly conservative line I'm inclined to think though no less playable for all that.  I used to like Bg5 in this type of position.
734,25,2,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',An aggressive posting for the bishop.  Black could play 6...dxc4 here inducing White to 'lose' a tempo by 7.Bxc4.  However as that tends to change the nature of the game Black figures that that might not be the best way to go.  A judgment call.
735,25,3,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Here we drop out of the Gameknot World Database.  Much more usual is 7...Nbd7.  One feels that this preventative move doesn't really prevent anything much.
736,25,4,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',(!) Good response: a strike at the centre.
737,25,5,dxe4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/8/2PPp3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Also possible was 8...dxc4.  Nothing much in it really.
738,25,6,1Bxe4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/8/2PPB3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Right now one feels that White should have something good going on the K-side - look at those bishops!  But constrained though Black's position is his resources are sufficient.  White doesn't get much traction on the K-side in the ensuing moves.
739,25,7,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/3P4/2P1B3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',(?!)  This looks rather premature to me.  Clearing away the centre as it does one is left with rather an arid looking game with neither side able to establish an ascendancy.  Well appearances can fool you as you will find out!  Better might have been to develop the dark-square bishop to e3 or f4.
740,25,8,1Qxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/7p/3Q4/4B3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',(!?) I think I might have been inclined to take with the bishop in similar circumstances.  One suspects White might have been expressing an interest in Q-exchanges here: 13...Nf6  14.Qxd8.
741,25,9,1Qe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/5n1p/4Q3/4B3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',But no!  He is not in least desirous of exchanging Queens!  
742,25,10,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp2bpp1/7p/8/4Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',At this point the consequences of White's 11th move become apparent.  His lead in development has largely been pulled in the centre is a vacuum and Black has the bishop pair in an open position.   Given the symmetry of the pawn structures I'd say the game was too close to call here.
743,25,11,1Qc2,b'r1bqr1k1/pp2bpp1/7p/8/8/5N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Cautiously removing the Q from the e-file.  But 16.Re1 would have maintained the Q's active posting for the nonce or 16.Bf4 would have been a useful development the Queen able to run away if attacked by say 16...Bf6.
744,25,12,1Qa4,b'2rqr1k1/pp2bpp1/4b2p/8/Q7/4BN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',A threat - the first sign that the pace might be picking up...
745,25,13,1Rfd1,b'2rqr1k1/1p2bpp1/p3b2p/8/Q7/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',One of the most difficult decisions one often has to make on the chessboard is 'which rook'?  Capablanca lost his first match game with Alekhine through making the wrong such decision.  Here White figures that the the rooks will have more scope if the King's Rook moves first to attack the enemy Queen.  
746,25,14,2Nd4,b'2r1r1k1/1pq1bpp1/p3b2p/8/Q2N4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',(?!) Possibly the other rook could have come in at c1 at this point.  
747,25,15,2Bf6,b'2r1r1k1/1pq2pp1/p3bb1p/8/Q2N4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',(!?) Instead 20...Bg4! would have livened up proceedings: 21.f3 Bd6 with the idea 22.fxg4 Bxh2ch  23.Kh1 Rxe3.  If White tries 21.Rdc1 then comes 21...Qe5  22.h3 (say) Bd6!  23.hxg4 Qh2ch  24.Kf1 Rxc1ch  25.Rxc1 Qh1ch  26.Ke2 Rxe3ch  27.fxe3 Qxc1.  
748,25,16,2Rac1,b'2r1r1k1/1pq2pp1/p3bb1p/8/Q2N4/4B3/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',Logical enough: gets the rook into action with a gain of time.  But there was something to be said for 21.Nxe6 as well: 21...Rxe6  22.Rc1 Qb8 23.Rxc8 Qxc8  24.Rc1 and then 25.b3 with a level game.
749,25,17,2Qd7,b'2r1r1k1/1p1q1pp1/p3bb1p/8/Q2N4/4B3/PP3PPP/2RR2K1 w - -','Might I interest you in a friendly exchange of Queens?'

752,25,20,Rd8,b'3r2k1/1p1q1pp1/p3bb1p/8/1Q1N4/4B3/PP3PPP/2R3K1 w - -',(?!)  Better was to grab the a2-pawn (23...Bxa2) whilst the grabbing was good.
753,25,21,2Rd1,b'3r2k1/1p1q1pp1/p3bb1p/8/1Q1N4/4B3/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',(?) 24.Nxe6 was indicated if only to save the a-pawn.  To very the good question  'What about 24.Nxe6 Qd1ch  25.Rxd1 Rxd1 and mates?'  White has this answer: 25.Qe1! Qxe1ch  26.Rxe1 fxe6  27.b3.   The slightly better pawn structure would then give White a marginal edge.
754,25,22,2Bxd4,b'3r2k1/1p1q1pp1/p3b2p/8/1Q1b4/4B3/PP3PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Again ...Bxa2 was indicated.
755,25,23,2Bxd4,b'3r2k1/1p1q1pp1/p3b2p/8/1Q1B4/8/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - -',If White were interested in forcing off the major pieces he could have played 25.Rxd4.  Not so good would have been 25.Qxd4 as after all the heavy pieces come off White drops his a-pawn.  Mind you that would leave Black with a tough job extracting the win with the bishops 'of opposite colours' - i.e. the respective bishops operating on opposite colour squares.
756,25,24,Bb3,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/8/3B4/Pb6/1Pq2PPP/3RQ1K1 w - -',Turnus at the ships!  Black throws in an attack and forces White onto the defensive.  But there just isn't the weight to make it good.
757,25,25,2Rd2,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/8/3B4/Pb6/1PqR1PPP/4Q1K1 b - -',Also likely was 28.Rc1 but this move is fine.   In the next few moves Aeneas (White) steps out of his entrenchments and forces the annexation of a sizeable chunk of the centre.  With just three pieces remaining many commentators would call this an endgame.  No: this is too 'middle-game-ish' to be called an endgame just yet.
758,25,26,2h3,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/5q2/3B4/Pb5P/1P1R1PP1/4Q1K1 b - -',(?) If White thought weakening the K-side pawns was necessary maybe 29.f3 would have been the better choice to restrict the enemy bishop and to give his own bishop more scope.  White does indeed play f3 shortly after this which further calls this move into question.
759,25,27,2Ba4,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/5q2/b2B4/P6P/1P1R1PP1/4Q1K1 w - -',At first sight ...Bd5 suggests itself but Black obviously wants the bishop firmly anchored at c6.
760,25,28,3Qc3,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1b4p/5q2/3B4/P1Q4P/1P1R1PP1/6K1 b - -',White is not standing still to be hit: he takes a smack of his own at the g7-square.  The battle is starting to get interesting g2 and g7 being the primary targets of Black and White respectively.
761,25,29,3Qg6,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1b3qp/8/3B4/P1Q4P/1P1R1PP1/6K1 w - -',Defends g7 and attacks g2 - combining attack and defence.
762,25,30,3f3,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1b3qp/8/3B4/P1Q2P1P/1P1R2P1/6K1 b - -',Cuts the Black bishop off from the attack.  See how White has also combined attack and defence.  From c3 the Queen supports the bishop's strike at g7 at the same time prevents the enemy bishop taking the pawn at f3.
763,25,31,3Qe6,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1b1q2p/8/3B4/P1Q2P1P/1P1R2P1/6K1 w - -',Trying a different tack.

765,25,33,3Bb5,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p3q2p/1b6/3B4/P1QR1P1P/1P4P1/6K1 w - -',Drives the Rook where White wants it to go.  But had Black anything better at this point?
766,25,34,Qc4,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/1b6/2qB4/P1Q1RP1P/1P4P1/6K1 w - -',Another Queen exchange offered by Black.  White doesn't want to know.  An alternative method of offering an exchange would have been 34...Rc8.  If White had chosen to accept (35.Rxe6 Rxc3  36.Bxc3 fxe6) the bishop ending would most likely have been drawn.
767,25,35,3Re4,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/1b6/2qBR3/P1Q2P1P/1P4P1/6K1 b - -',(?) At last White makes a serious mistake that might well have cost him the game.  The Rook protects the bishop and the threat is 36.Bxg7  but Black has a strong response to this.  Instead White could simply have snatched the g7-pawn and made off with the booty: 35.Bxg7!
768,25,36,3Qf1+,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p6p/1b6/3BR3/P1Q2P1P/1P4P1/5qK1 w - -',Probably Black had this in mind all along if White refused to exchange.  But with 35...f5! Black would have won material (36.Rh4 g5!  37.Rxh6 Qxd4).
769,25,37,Bc6,b'3r2k1/1p3pp1/p1b4p/8/3BR3/P1Q2P1P/1P4PK/5q2 w - -',(?) Black would have maintained a level pegging by playing 37...Qd3 or ...Qc4 offereing Queen exchanges again.  Now White gains the upper hand.

One is a quite a bit better; the other much much better!  The 'Quite a bit better' line runs 37.Bxg7!? Bxe4!?  (A rook sac withal!  But it gets better!)  38.Bxh6 ... and Black will have to shed cartloads of material to avert checkmate;  or  37...Qd3! 38.Rg4 Qxc3  39.Bxc3ch Kf8  40.Bxg7ch and picks up a second pawn to improve his chances in the opposite-bishop ending.  What about the 'Much much better' line then?  At once 37.Rg4! and Black is busted:  37.Rg4 g6  38.Bh8 Kf8  39.Qc5ch Ke8  [39...Kg8 40.Qe5 Kf8   41.Bg7ch Kg8  42.Bxh6 with a forced mate]  40.Bf6 Rd7   41.Qe5ch Kf8  42.Qb8ch etc.

This one's not really a rook sacrifice but it's a spectacular move all he same.  After 41.Re4!! Bxe4  42.Qxc8ch Kh7  43.Qh8ch Kg6  44.Qg7ch  Kf5  45.fxe4ch and however he plays it Black is forced into a hopeless endgame.

Suppose instead of ...Bxe4 Black tried 43...Qd6?  then comes  44.Rg4ch Kf8  45.Bh4!! ... (Very hard move to find this but it threatens mate and other ghastlinesses such as 45...Ke8  46.Re4ch Bxe4  47.Qxc8ch etc)  45...f6  46.Rg6 winning.  After this move White finds himself having to redeploy the rook.

But it was here that Black had a hidden resource that might well have saved the situation.  Yes it is a sacrifice: 44...Bxf3!! Surprisingly White has no way of averting mate without loss of material.  His best reply is to counter-sacrifice: 45.Qxf3! Qxe1ch  46.Kh2 Rd6  47.Qg4ch Kf8  48.Bc3 ... followed by 49.Bb4 recovers the exchange.   Possibly White has the edge in the pawn ending after 48.Bc3 Qe6  49.Bb4 Ke7  50.Qxe6ch!? Kxe6  51.Bxd6 Kxd6  52.Kg3 - I haven't tested that...

Bxc8  47.Rd8ch Kh7  48.Rh8ch Kg6   49.Rg8ch Kxf6  50.Rxg3.  With Rook and extra pawn for the bishop White would have taken out the ending with few difficulties.

783,25,51,Be6,b'2r3k1/1p3p2/p3b2p/4B3/8/P4P1P/1P4P1/3R2K1 w - -',Sensible: anchors the bishop.  In the endgame that ensues Black is thrown onto the defensive: a pawn down and no real prospects for counter-attack.

785,25,53,5Bc3,b'3R4/1p3p1k/p3b2p/8/8/P1B2P1P/1P4PK/4r3 b - -',Retiring to a safe anchorage also.  Both sides are playing this ending with circumspection.  However it will be a difficult one for White to win.  His chances are really localised to the K-side which limits his options rather.  Instead of the text he might have tried 51.Rh8ch Kg6  52.Bf4 (attacking the h-pawn)  52...Rb1  53.Rxh6ch Kf5  54.Be3 Rxb2? and now 55.Bd4! Ra2  56.Rf6ch Kg5  57.h4ch Kxh4  58.Be3 ... (weaving a mating net; Black has but one way to escape) 58...Bg4!  59.Rxf7! Bh5  60.Rf5 Bg6  61.Re5 Rc2  62.Bf4! ... All this intricate manoeuvring leads to a forced mate - a really fine finish.  Black doesn't have to play 54...Rxb2 but then he gets left with two pawns' deficit.  Holding the game really does become problematic in that event.
786,25,54,5Kg3,b'6R1/1p3p2/p3b2p/5k2/8/P1B2PKP/1P2r1P1/8 b - -',White cannot allow Black too easy ingress into his position as then Black would have serious prospects of counter-play enough maybe to turn the tables completely.
787,25,55,5Rh8,b'7R/1p3p2/p6p/3b1k2/8/P1B2PKP/1P2r1P1/8 b - -',Instead White could have carried on as he was doing and gone after the h-pawn with his King.  The rook standing at g8 would have performed two useful functions: protecting the g-pawn and cutting the Black King off from access to the g- and h-files.  So: 55.Kh4 was called for:  55...Kf4  56.Rg4ch Kf5  57.Rd5 Bc6  58.g4ch and White is making progress.
788,25,56,Kh7,b'8/1p3p1k/p1bR3p/8/8/P1B2PKP/1P2r1P1/8 w - -',Probably Black should have intervened with rook here (57...Re6)
789,25,57,Re6,b'8/1p3p1k/p1bRr2p/8/8/P4PKP/1P1B2P1/8 w - -',Forced else the h-pawn fell.
790,25,58,5Rxe6,b'8/1p3p1k/p1b1R2p/8/8/P4PKP/1P1B2P1/8 b - -',Understandably White exchanges down into a simpler ending (simpler in this context means just fewer units on the board) seeing no way to progress with the rooks on.  I'd probably keep probing with them on for a bit longer as White's winning prospects in the pure Bishop and Pawn ending don't look too flash.  The pure pawn ending might be a different story but how do you arrange (let alone force) the exchange of bishops when they are invulnerable to each other?
791,25,59,6Kg4,b'8/1p6/p1b1p1kp/8/6K1/P4P1P/1P1B2P1/8 b - -',Seizing the Opposition.  However there might have been better prospects with 61.g4 (...e5ch; 62.Kg3! h5  63.Bc3 hxg4  64.fxg4 e4  65.Kf4 say).
792,25,60,6Kh4,b'8/1p6/p1b1p1k1/7p/7K/P4P1P/1P1B2P1/8 b - -',This looks counter-intuitive at first sight.  But now Black will find that maintaining this pawn will not be easy.  For the King to move Black will have to bring his bishop to e8.  Having said that though it doesn't look as though White's King has much of a future either.
793,25,61,Bc6,b'8/1p6/p1b1p1k1/7p/1P5K/P4P1P/3B2P1/8 w - -',Marking time. The onus is upon White to show he can win this ending.
794,25,62,6Kg3,b'8/1p6/p1b1p1k1/7p/1P6/P4PKP/3B2P1/8 b - -',Recasting his plans.
795,25,63,6fxg4+,b'8/1p6/p3p3/3b1k2/1P4P1/P6P/3B1K2/8 b - -',At the cost of allowing Black a passed pawn White creates co-joined passers of his own.
796,25,64,6g5,b'8/1p6/p3p1k1/3b2P1/1P6/P6P/3B1K2/8 b - -',(!?) This move I don't like.  True passed pawns should be pushed but in general  co-joined passers should present a united front.  The right move then was probably 68.h4.  Even then supposing the position was reached with no change but the h-pawn on h4 I'd play h5(ch) keeping the dark squares open for the King and the bishop to operate on.  From here getting the pawns forward will be more difficult.  Having said all that it turns out that White is doing better than I thought...
797,25,65,6Kh5,b'8/1p6/p3p3/3b2Pk/1P6/P6P/3B1K2/8 w - -',Good: making use of the light squares left unguarded.
798,25,66,Bf5,b'8/1p6/p3p3/5bPk/1P5P/P5K1/3B4/8 w - -',Black's defences on the K-side look pretty solid eh?
799,25,67,7Be1,b'8/1p6/p3p3/5bPk/1P5P/P5K1/8/4B3 b - -',(!) I can't see any other way of making progress either.  But as it turns out this seems to be enough to offer White very good chances after all.  
800,25,68,7Be4,b'8/1p6/p3p3/6Pk/1P2b2P/P5K1/8/4B3 w - -',And there you have it.  Black was in something of a 'zugzwang' and had to make this small concession: a couple of tempi for White...
801,25,69,7Ke5,b'8/1p6/p3p3/4KbPk/1P5P/P7/8/4B3 b - -',Having teleported himself to e5 with zero expenditure of energy (Black's position remaining unchanged) white imposes upon Black once more.  Probably Black should play 73...Kg6 here though White can then choose from 74.Kd6 Kf7  75.Kc7 Be4  76.h5; or maybe 74.Bd2 threatening h5ch Kxh5; Kf6.
802,25,70,7Kf6,b'8/1p6/p3pK2/6Pk/1P4bP/P7/8/4B3 b - -',"1-0.  Black gave it up at this point.  I thought at first he should have played on: White still had the job to do.  Now I am less inclined to be critical.  For instance after 74...Bf5 White does not at once play 75.g6? but a waiting move: 75.Bf2.  Then White continues to play waiting moves until Black relaxes his guard over e6 or g6 so: 74...Bf5  75.Bf2 b5  76.Be1 Bg4  77.g6 Kh6  78.Bd2ch Kh5  79.g7 wins.
My earlier suggested 'improvements' notwithstanding this is a well played example of a difficult type of ending. "

I think it would be a nice idea to explore the Grob Opening where white starts out with 1. g4.  It was a very enterprising idea of Jerry to try against Class A 1900 oppo.

It is an interesting opening and now will come the first of two correspondence games which are not from Gameknot but from the THEM series that Freddy the Master Mater also plays in.  My opponent is chessmaniac (Guy Shelmerdine).  We started that THEM tournament via e-mail but then after Guy joined Gameknot we agreed to play out the rest of the game on Gameknot.

1125,36,34,Rxf6,b'8/7R/bp2pr2/p2p1kP1/P2P1n2/2P3B1/3K4/8 w - -',Black must take or RxR.

Now I have the White pieces and I've abandoned my current infatuation with wing openings (English Larsen etc) in favor of the old standby 1.e4! I was hoping to get some practice with the Sicilian and my opponent very kindly gave it to me. The game that followed was about as wild as one might expect from this opening. Enjoy!

1134,37,7,Qe1,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1ppbp/p1p2np1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq -',Both players re-position their Queens to be able to access the kingside more effectively. This is still all very standard: the big question for White is now which square--f2 g3 or h4--is best for his Queen. For Black the question is just how to avoid creating any weaknesses for White to attack.
1135,37,8,1Be3,b'r1b2rk1/1pq1ppbp/p1p2np1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',"This particular Bishop move was intended basically just to free White's Queen Rook in preparation for swinging it to the center or all the way to f1. I chose to move to e3 rather than d2 simply because it's a ""free"" move: Black must respond to my threat on the c5 pawn."
1136,37,9,1b6,b'r1b2rk1/2q1ppbp/ppp2np1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',So he does but now the c6 pawn is weak.
1137,37,10,1Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/2q1ppbp/ppp2np1/2p1N3/4PP2/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',This is sort of an empty attack since the c-pawn is defended but the intention is really just to see what Black will do about this advanced Knight. Chess is as much a psychological game as anything else and this Knight advance helps to reveal Black's mindset: is he willing to let the Knight stay? Will he just push back directly on the queenside?
1138,37,11,1Nd7,b'r1b2rk1/2qnppbp/ppp3p1/2p1N3/4PP2/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',Black wants the e5 Knight gone and I don't blame him. White still gets something out of this though: he's removed one of the Black King's defenders.
1139,37,12,1a4,b'r4rk1/2qbppbp/ppp3p1/2p5/P3PP2/2NPB3/1PP3PP/R3QRK1 b - a3',It looks like an attack but really White just wants to forestall an onslaught on the queenside since he's about to shift all hands to a kingside attack.
1140,37,13,1a5,b'r4rk1/2qbppbp/1pp3p1/p1p5/P3PP2/2NPB3/1PP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',Black closes off the queenside which is not a choice I would have made. Perhaps he misinterpreted White's thirteenth move as an aggressive thrust after all!
1141,37,14,1Rb1,b'r4rk1/2qbppbp/1pp3p1/p1p5/P3PP2/2NPB3/1PP3PP/1R2QRK1 b - -',Getting off the long diagonal and supporting the b-pawn. A quiet but necessary step before the Nc3 can leave its post. This also has the advantage of looking aggressive (and indeed it could become aggressive!) which may cause Black to commit more to the queenside than he needs to. The computer evaluates the position as dead even here.
1142,37,15,1e5,b'r4rk1/2qb1pbp/1pp3p1/p1p1p3/P3PP2/2NPB3/1PP3PP/1R2QRK1 w - e6',This seems to be just a space-gaining thrust. Black certainly doesn't have much room to maneuver right now.
1143,37,16,1Qh4,b'r4rk1/2qb1pbp/1pp3p1/p1p1p3/P3PP1Q/2NPB3/1PP3PP/1R3RK1 b - -',The WQ is actually headed for g3 but this is an attempt to first draw the Black Queen out of position. My thought was that on d8 the BQ would obstruct the QR--essentially removing another potential defender from the Black kingside.
1144,37,17,1Qd8,b'r2q1rk1/3b1pbp/1pp3p1/p1p1p3/P3PP1Q/2NPB3/1PP3PP/1R3RK1 w - -',White's plan has worked! It remains to be seen if it was actually worth something though.

1151,37,24,1gxf5,b'r3r2k/3bqpbp/1pp5/p1p1pp2/P3P3/2NPBRQ1/1PP3PP/5RK1 w - -',?! Black cracks under the tension in front of his King. It certainly complicates the position but I think it's premature. The computer suggests an incredibly complex line starting with 19...Bf6 (threatening ...Bh4) 20.Qf2 g5 21.Qg3 Rg8 22.Qg4 Rg7 23.Rh3.
1152,37,25,f6,b'r3r2k/3bq1bp/1pp2p2/p1p1pP2/P7/2NPBRQ1/1PP3PP/5RK1 w - -',? This seems to have been the idea behind 19...gxf5. I think it's the right idea (blocking the f-pawn's advance) but the wrong execution. 20...Bf6 looks much stronger to me: that Bishop is really a huge blockage to Black's troops right now.
1153,37,26,2Ne4,b'r3r2k/3bq1bp/1pp2p2/p1p1pP2/P3N3/3PBRQ1/1PP3PP/5RK1 b - -',White finally brings the Queen's Knight into the game pointing at f6 and preventing any annoying thrusts from the e-pawn.
1154,37,27,2Reg8,b'r5rk/3bq1bp/1pp2p2/p1p1pP2/P3N3/3PBRQ1/1PP3PP/5RK1 w - -',This seems logical enough but I'd be worried about the King's ability to escape... More importantly perhaps this does not allow more defenders of h7 which is clearly about to come under fire. The DSB is simply in the way of everything. 21...Rf8 (with an eye to ...Rf7) might have been a little stronger.

As far as the computer's concerned I should be forcing huge complicated trades to make analysis easier  with 24.Ng3 Bh6 (getting out of the way!) 25.Bxh6 Rg4 26.Qxg4 hxg4 27.Bf8+ gxh3 28.Bxe7 etc.
1159,37,32,2Kh7,b'r3b1r1/4q1bk/1pp2p2/p1p1pP1p/P3N1PQ/3PB2R/1PP4P/5RK1 w - -',?!? The plan here must be to play ...Bh6 without hanging the piece but I really don't think Black has that kind of time. Now White has an interesting opportunity...
1160,37,33,2g5,b'r3b1r1/4q1bk/1pp2p2/p1p1pPPp/P3N2Q/3PB2R/1PP4P/5RK1 b - -',! No need to take on h5 when White can instead just march his pawn along and force the creation of a passer (25...fxg5 makes the f5 pawn passed and well-supported). Besides that he's also threatening something bigger...
1161,37,34,2Bh6,b'r3b1r1/4q2k/1pp2p1b/p1p1pPPp/P3N2Q/3PB2R/1PP4P/5RK1 w - -',? Black tries to use the pin on the g-pawn to stop all the threats against f6 and so on but White has a simple resource. Once more why capture when you can simply advance and save the kill for a better piece?
1162,37,35,2g6+,b'r3b1r1/4q2k/1pp2pPb/p1p1pP1p/P3N2Q/3PB2R/1PP4P/5RK1 b - -',The presence of the Rook on the g-file makes this situation much trickier than it appears at first. Now Black's best choice is 26...Bxg6! where 27.fxg6+? loses steam against 27...Rxg6+. So White must find the right continuation in 27.Nxf6+! Kh8 and now 28.Bxh6 should win for White eventually but the position is rife with complex tactical opportunities for Black based on the open g-file and the possibility for discovered attacks between the two Queens and elsewhere.

The most terrifying piece that could land on f6 is the bishop but it is not even close to that square so no worries.
