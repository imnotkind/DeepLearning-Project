53,1,23,2f3,b'4r1k1/1b4b1/4r1pp/p7/4NRP1/P1P2P1P/8/2K1R3 b - -',?? Again blocking the rook's only retreat square.  The game is lost but better lose a knight than a rook.
54,1,24,Be5,b'4r1k1/1b6/4r1pp/p3b3/4NRP1/P4P1P/4R3/2K5 w - -',And the rook is trapped!
55,1,25,Bxf4+,b'4r1k1/1b6/4r1pp/p1N5/5bP1/P4P1P/4R3/2K5 w - -',My opponent must have missed the check that came with taking the rook here but the game would be lost even if the king were on b1.  Good game wcates.  I hope you all enjoyed.
56,2,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',Al loves the Dutch though technically this game never quite becomes one because White plays his d-pawn to the 3rd rank instead of the 4th. Had Al played 1. ...f5 I would have pounced on him with 2. g4!? the Krejcik Gambit with which I've trounced him several times from within the context of an English pawn formation. Old dogs can apprently learn new tricks: Al's more circumspect here waiting until I've committed both my KN and g-pawn in a way that makes the gambit impossible to play. ...Sneaky booger!
57,2,1,Ne1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4pp2/2P5/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQNRK1 b - -',"This move is virtually thematic with me from this and any closely resembling ""White Dragon"" pawn formation. The Knight is off to c2 where it helps support the center and a Q-side pawn expansion. The move also uncovers the long diagonal for White's King's Bishop another de rigueur theme for White in the fianchettoed English."
58,2,2,Qe8,b'r1b1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4pp2/2P5/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQNRK1 w - -',"With the text Black pursues a strategy almost exclusive to the Dutch. And now if 9. Nb5 Bd8 followed by a push to c6 and Bc7 with an almost ideal defensive shell for the middlegame - in other words exactly the sort of closed game Al prefers. So I didn't even consider 9. Nb5. ----- In some ways as I remarked to Al during the game (we were talking on the phone while playing) our strategies became for a while a case of ""I'll ignore you if you ignore me"" as as if by unspoken agreement we each pursued the opening pretty much unmolested by the other."
59,2,3,1b4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4pp1q/1PP5/2NP2P1/P1N1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - b3',Black's last move is no threat at all unless White panics.
60,2,4,1e3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1b1pp/2np3n/4pp1q/1PP5/2NPP1PP/P1N2PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',! Black wants to play ...f4 bringing the QB to bear against White's K-side. This response to that threat puts the question to Black's rather hasty aggression immediately while simultaneously setting up White's own pawn-push to f4 stoppering up the attack on White's K-side which frees the first player to probe for weaknesses on Black's Q-side.
61,2,5,Nf7,b'r1bb1rk1/ppp2n1p/2np4/3Nppp1/1PP5/3PP1PP/PBN2PB1/R2R2K1 w - -',Black sets up for a pawnstorm preparing a push to h5.
62,2,6,1a4,b'r1bb1rk1/ppp2n1p/2np4/3Nppp1/PPP5/3PP1PP/1BN2PB1/R2R2K1 b - a3',But White's pawns come first.
63,2,7,1Kh2,b'r2b1rk1/1pp2n1p/p1npb3/P2Nppp1/1PP5/3PP1PP/1BN2PBK/R2R4 b - -',The prophylactic pause that refreshes! White dithers constructively getting his King out of any future line of back-rank fire while waiting for Black to commit himself to something.
64,2,8,1Bc3,b'1r1b1rk1/1pp2n1p/p1npb3/P2Nppp1/1PP5/2BPP1PP/2N2PBK/R2R4 b - -',"Double-protecting the a-pawn before playing the break. Black's pieces have very little useful to do: White has a meaningful space advantage while Black's K-side pawnstorm is mostly for show without his Queen to help facilitate it. It's a funny position - almost a sort of ""inside joke"" that only Al and I would understand right away: even though the fully closed position seems to favor his defensive style the tactical breaks and chances all belong to me at the moment."
65,2,9,axb5,b'1r1b1rk1/1pp2n2/3p2n1/Pp2pppp/1NP5/2BPP1PP/5PBK/R2R4 w - -',?! Black only makes things tense for himself with this exchange. White's a-pawn is now a potential game-winner.
66,2,10,Kh7,b'1r1b1r2/1pp2n1k/3p2n1/PP1Bppp1/1N5p/2BPP1PP/5P1K/R2R4 w - -',Playing to g7 wasn't much better with White's dark-squared Bishop looming on the other long diagonal and a nasty break in the works after White plays his f-pawn to f4. However at least ...Kg7 didn't block the h-file for Black's Rooks which is what I was playing for.
67,2,11,2Kg2,b'1r1b1r2/1pp2n1k/3p2n1/PP1Bppp1/1N5p/2BPP1PP/5PK1/R2R4 b - -',Now the file becomes available for White's Rooks instead if Black insists on prying it open.
68,2,12,2Bc4,b'1r1b1r2/1pp4k/3p2nn/PP2ppp1/1NB4p/2BPP1PP/5PK1/R2R4 b - -',?? Just awful. Instead 27. a6!! is a killer shot that wins material by force. If 27. ...b6  28. a7 wins the Rook or nets White a new Queen. If 27. ...ba6  28. ba6 Be7  29. a7 leads to great woe for Black as well. In fact White could have played the pawn to a6 with dire effect as early as the 24th move. Removed from the long diagonal suddenly White's light-squared Bishop becomes nothing but a spectator instead of a game-winner. Let *that* be a lesson about the power of Bishops on the long diagonals for you chess beginners.
69,2,13,2hxg4,b'1r1b1r2/1pp4k/3p2nn/PP2pp2/1NB3Pp/2BPP1P1/5PK1/R2R4 b - -',?! This is dubious. White should let Black do all the pawn exchanging on these files a step farther than the reach of Black's Knights. The correct move was 28. Bd5! reopening the threat of 29. a6!! After working up a winning position White is now doing his best to throw it away through passive waiting moves and ill-advised pawn exchanges. ----- Let that also be a lesson to you chess beginners: always look for the most forcing moves that will give you an advantage however small or large it may be and then play them. Dithering has its place at times; but generally one should never dither in chess unless circumstances *demand* it.
70,2,14,2a6,b'1r1b1r2/1pp4k/P2p2nn/1P2p3/1NB3pp/2BPP1P1/5PK1/R2R4 b - -',But there's no sting to it now. The correct move is STILL 29. Bd5!
71,2,15,axb5,b'1r1b1r2/2p4k/2Np2nn/1p2p3/2B3pp/2BPP1P1/5PK1/R2R4 w - -',Black's best chance. If 30. ...Rb6  31. Ra6 followed by 32. Ba5. White is still winning of course but disappointingly missed making this a beautiful positional victory over a good positional player by overlooking 27. a6!!
72,2,16,Bg5,b'1N3r2/2p4k/3p2nn/4p1b1/2P3p1/2B1P1P1/6K1/R2R4 w - -',Suddenly Black has all sorts of counterplay for his Exchange-down. This is the price you pay for not playing forcing moves beginners; keep it in mind.
73,2,17,Rf3,b'8/2p4k/2Np2nn/4p1b1/2P3p1/2B1PrP1/6K1/R2R4 w - -',! Much nastier than ...Be3 and completely justified. Knowing he still loses this particular Exchange-down endgame Black is trying to spin a mating web around White's suddenly all-too-exposed King. There is no stopping the threat of ...Nf5.
74,2,18,Bxe3,b'8/R1p4k/2Np2nn/4p3/2P3p1/2B1brP1/6K1/3R4 w - -',Is there a better move here? I can't find one although I certainly don't like the text because it allows White's pieces to spring to life again.
75,2,19,3c5,b'7k/2R5/2Np2n1/2P1pn2/6p1/4brP1/6K1/3RB3 b - -',Arrrg! White's little mental errors are becoming critical. The correct move was 38. Rb1 or a1.
76,2,20,Nh4+,b'7k/2R5/2Np4/2b1p3/6pn/5rP1/6K1/R3Bn2 w - -',!?!? An all-or-nothing shot the swindling move so beautiful even though it shouldn't win!! The correct move here is 42. Kh1!! and White still wins.
77,2,21,Ne3+,b'7k/2R5/2Np4/2b1p3/6pP/4nr2/6K1/R3B3 w - -',Urrrrk!! Gag!! Suddenly I see clearly what I've done to myself. Now I just have to make sure Al sees it too.
78,2,22,Nc2+,b'7k/2R5/2Np4/2b1p3/6pP/7r/2n5/R3B1K1 w - -',I actually expected him to play ...Nd5 but the text drives the stake into White's heart just as emphatically.
79,2,23,Nxa1,b'7k/2R5/2Np4/2b1p3/6pP/7r/8/n3BK2 w - -',White's position is hopeless and he resigns. What a shocker from squandering a won game at move 27 to suicidally engineering a complete crash-and-burn by move 45 thanks to Black's absolutely beautiful swindling move and just one second of inattention immediately following it. This is truly what we call snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. ---But most of the credit has to go to Black's fighting spirit; he never gave up. Great game Al!
80,3,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Going for the 2 knights opening.

212,7,44,3Bf4,b'6rk/p1p2p1r/P2p1q2/1PpPp3/2P1Pb2/6N1/4BPQ1/3R1K2 w - -',Overlooking the much better Be3! threatening if white goes Ke1 Bxf7+ Qxf7 QxQ+ KxQ Rh2+ and if the white king goes to g1 RxB since the knight is pinned (!) and if Kf1 RxN. So it is a big think for white to try to defend from it. Of course the played move has its own threats (BxN!)
213,7,45,3Qf3,b'6rk/p1p2p1r/P2p1q2/1PpPp3/2P1Pb2/5QN1/4BP2/3R1K2 b - -',A good way to defend if you asked yourself if Bf4 was really deadly.

216,7,48,3Qh4,b'6rk/p1p2p2/P2p4/1PpPp3/2P1Pb1q/5QNr/4BPK1/3R4 w - -',Unfortunately my opponent resigned here. I can play with a possible following. The threat is BxN and white cannot retake because of Rxg3+ winning the queen for a rook the least OR Rh2+ Kg1 BxN. White can try to add a defence to g3 and the best way seems to be Rd3 x-raying its own queen. It works IMO. Would someone check please? Qh5+ QxQ BxQ RxQ is not good for now but is one of white's resource to release the pressure black has to be aware of.

It feels strange for me to have a fianchettoed bishop in the Caro-Kann because how can I play c5? I'm looking at Qb6 next and then Nbd7 and at some point e6.

259,10,6,2Bb2,b'r4rk1/p1qn1p2/4p2p/1Pp3pP/P7/2b3N1/1B2QPP1/R4RK1 b - -',It's been a few days since I saw this game. I was looking at this position trying to see the best way to keep the pawn. Should I play Qe5 or just take the pawn? Then I saw that I'm up  a pawn! I don't even remember that happening. So let's trade.
260,10,7,Kf8,b'r2r1k2/p1q2p2/4pN1p/1P2n1pP/P1p5/2Q5/5PP1/R4RK1 w - -',I probably should've moved f5 instead of Rfd8 a couple of moves ago. That would've kept his knight off of e4 (and would've let me play Kf7 if I got into a position like this). Now I think he can force a draw.

The capture of the c3 knight gives the position the structure of a nimzo indian which is part of my main opening repertoire. 
264,11,2,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2PP4/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black's intention is to fix the white c pawns up for attack. White should strive to activate the bishop pair and make it count for something. Therefore he should castle keep the tension between the pawns play in the center with move of e4. Black will try to make white the one releasing the tension by playing ...e5. So white needs to stop this move. However my opponent was not thinking about the planning and just makes ordinary moves that give black an advantage.

Here is a rule you can use when ceding the bishop pair. *When ceding a bishop of a color you can place your pawns on the color of that bishop*. It works a lot of the time in many openings.

Right now white has weaknesses while it is much more difficult to attack black's position. The weakness on c4 can be probed at almost anytime and any endgame with king and another piece should favor black. Therefore black is having a big strategical advantagae.

Here I started to worry a bit and saw my missed win. So I slowed back down and composed another plan. Since I have space on the kingside as well as the king to attack and some misplaced white pieces I need to attack there. ...f5 is an idea followed by ...f4. Furthermore white is not losing his light squared bishop for less effective knight so I can exploit the light weaknesses as well.

2.Oh this move forks his pieces exploits weak king and frees my position it must be the best move! Admiring a move can only blind you to other possibilities.

Not that's any hardship for Black nor ought this information be hugely reassuring for White.
394,19,2,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',A crossroads.  White still had the option to play a Closed Sicilian but with this central thrust irrevocably embarks on the much more popular Open game.

It goes on: 'It has ... retained its feasibility.'  These ...e5 counter-thrusts by Black (a feature also of the Najdorf) herald an aggressive approach to the game by Black.   There is a downside however and that is the d5 and d6 squares become weak and the Black d-pawn backward.  Black 'expects' that his active play will mask or offset this strategic defect.
396,19,4,Nb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This move is just about White's automatic response to Black's central aggression and indicates White's readiness to go toe-to-toe with his opponent.  Also feasible were 5.Nb3 and 5.Nf3 but neither places any pressure on Black.  The text move immediately tries to exploit Black's weaknesses on the d-file.
397,19,5,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/1N2p3/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',(?)  In general moving a piece twice in the opening is not a good idea 'unless there is a tactic'.  On the other hand White's knight has moved 3 times already and will soon have to make a 4th.  But given the strategic risk inherent in Black's choice of line perhaps more celerity in development is called for.  Indicated (and usual) is 5...d6 solidifying the centre and freeing the light-square bishop (LSB) and gearing up for Q-side expansion within a few moves.
398,19,6,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Oh yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well.  He is now left into the bargain an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani').  Note that White's Q is nicely placed unassailable in centre board.
399,19,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',(?!) 'Knights before Bishops' quoth GM Lasker.  But circumstances alter cases.  At the moment White's small advanced guard is imposing a little bit of a crimp in Black's game.  One way to free this is to enquire of White if he is interested in exchanging Queens: 7...Qa5ch  8.Bd2 Qc5.  After 9.Qxc5 Bxc5 Black will have at least have caught up in the race for mobilization (development).  The Queen exchange itself would be justified by its effect in freeing Black's game.  Meanwhile...
400,19,8,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/6B1/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',(!?) Was this intended to provoke Black's next?  Instead White could have caused at least one red face across the board by playing 8.e5 whereat Black's only feasible response is 8...Ng8 - a loss of two tempi!

403,19,11,Be7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/q5B1/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',(??) Black hadn't seen it either!  Well this sort of mutual oversight is not unknown even among grandmasters but all the same one wonders what Black had in mind for the Queen check.  Bearing in mind that the move played is a poor second best it still made a lot of sense to prevent the further break-up of Black's pawns after Bxf6.  Of course ...QxB would have served the same function.
404,19,12,1Bc4,b'r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/q5B1/2BQP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',(??) Developing but still failing to connect the dots between a5 and g5.  Black is the first to wake up...

Not only does this pick up a piece free gratis and for nothing; it threatens ...Qxg2 and ...Qc1ch.  Fortunately White can escape with a developing move...

For one thing if White exchanges bishops (he has little other option) Black find his f-file opened for the Rook(s).  However this pawn advance does secure the DSB's tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal and its pressure on f2.
412,19,20,1h3,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/2b5/2B1P1q1/2PQ1N1P/PP3PP1/4RRK1 b - -',(?) Gratuitously weakening his own K-side.  I'm willing to bet Black was hoping this would come sooner or later...  Instead White ought to have been looking to the other wing.  Something like this might have been worth a crack: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Qd8ch Rf8  20.Qd5ch Kh8  21.Rxe4.  Black can vary from this but so can White.  A possible variant is this: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Qe7!  Probably best for Black here is 18...Bf5 but 18...Be6 may be as effective though it does carry a risk: 18...Be6!?  19.Bxe6 fxe6  20.Ne5! Qf5? (Looks plausible but best is ...Qh5 which preserves Black's edge)  21.Rxe4 Qxe4?? (21...Bxf2ch keeps things about level) Qxe6ch and it is White that is winning!  Probably Black would have been best advised after 16.b4! to avoid the whole shambles and played 16...b5 instead.

Two well-known motifs are being exploited here: the Black Queen and Bishop exploiting the pin at f2; and the threat of ...Bxh3 and exploiting the pin at g2.  Combining motifs: the mark of a tactician.
414,19,22,1Kh1,b'r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/2b5/2B1P3/2PQ1NqP/PP3PP1/4RR1K b - -',(?) The obvious move - a product of panic maybe?  But now Black wins the f2-pawn and retains exclusive and unchallengeable tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal.  White has almost no play available neither for counter-attack nor for defence.

It is hard to determine the motive for giving up the exchange like this unless in White's opinion Black's active and deadly DSB was worth more to Black than his rather moribund rook was to White.  Instead 18.Re2 was called for.  Now White goes a whole rook down without the slightest chance to turn things around.

474,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Kramnik the defending world champion scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; Peter Leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. This is only the third time in the entire history of the World Championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. The game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. Despite consistent exchanges throughout the game Kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. Taking no account of material sacrifices it was Kramnik’s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. This outstanding game the best of the match recalled the classic fifth game won by Petrosian against Botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought White a classic victory. ""I had to give everything especially at the end to win against such an opponent. Peter Leko is an incredible defender. For me it was more difficult than my match against Kasparov in the year 2000"" said Kramnik after the game. Leko said in conclusion: ""It was a very hard fight. In the end it was not enough for me to win the title. I'm disappointed but I'm looking forward to the future. I'm 25 years old and I hope to get a new chance to become world champion."" "
475,21,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -', Leko is not averse to repeating the main lines of the Caro-Kann.
476,21,2,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',By contrast Kramnik must seek sharper paths. This move favoured by Nimzowitsch Tal and Short is ideal for a must-win situation since it locks pawn formations and avoids premature exchanges.
477,21,3,h4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P3P/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3', Nimzowitsch liked this 3 e5 variation and would play here 4 Bd3. His most famous game with this line is sadly a loss a magnificent manoeuvring game against Capablanca from New York 1927. The most common alternative these days is 4 Nc3 as played for example by Kasparov in a drastic win over Karpov at Linares 2001 which continued 4...e6 5 g4 Bg6 6 Nge2 Ne7 7 Nf4 c5 8 dxc5 Nd7 9 h4 Nxe5 10 Bg2 h5 11 Qe2 N7c6 12 Nxg6 Nxg6 13 Bg5 Be7 14 gxh5 Nf8 15 Nb5 Nd7 16 h6. The latest try for Black is 4 Nc3 a5!? as in Sebag-Chiburdanidze FIDE WCh Women KO Elista 2004. Black won in 33 moves after 5 Be3 a4 6 a3 Qb6 7 Rb1 Qa5 8 g4 Bd7 9 Bg2 e6 10 Nge2 c5 11 0–0 Nc6 12 f4 h5. This 4 h4 line was tested repeatedly in the Tal-Botvinnik WCC match Moscow 1961 with generally favourable results for Black. The paths they followed are retraced below.
478,21,4,h6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3pPb2/3P3P/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -', 4...h5 may be preferable after which Tal tried 5 Ne2 e6 6 Ng3 g6 7 Nxf5 gxf5 8 c4 c5 9 cxd5 Qxd5 but only drew their 14th game from 1961.
479,21,5,g4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3pPb2/3P2PP/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3', Instead 5 Ne2 is possible and in their 20th game 5 e6 6 Ng3 Ne7 7 Nc3 Nd7 8 Be3 Bh7 9 Bd3 Bxd3 10 cxd3 h5 led to a marathon struggle and another draw.
480,21,6,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bppp1/2p4p/3pP3/3P2PP/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It looks more natural to retreat the bishop along the b1-h7 diagonal but in that case Black has to reckon with the dangerous pawn sac e5-e6.
481,21,7,Nd2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bppp1/2p4p/3pP3/3P2PP/8/PPPN1P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This looks like a new move. In the 10th Tal-Botvinnik game from 1961 we saw 6 h5 c5 7 c3 Nc6 8 Bh3 e6 9 Be3 Qb6 10 Qb3 cxd4 11 Qxb6 axb6 12 cxd4 Na5 and Black won in 42; while the 18 th game followed the course 6 c3 c5 7 Bg2 e6 8 Ne2 Bb5 9 Na3 Bxe2 10 Qxe2 cxd4 11 cxd4 Bxa3 12 bxa3 Nc6 and Black won again. However Tal persisted with this line and in Tal-Pachman Bled 1961 he finally won after launching an attack following 7... e6 8 f4 Qb6 9 Nf3 Nc6 10 Na3 cxd4 11 cxd4 O-O-O 12 Nc2 Kb8 13 Bd3 Nge7 14 Rb1 Na5 15 Bd2 Rc8 16 b4.
482,21,8,c5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bppp1/7p/2ppP3/3P2PP/8/PPPN1P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black has one way to free himself before White's pawns begin to exert a fatal grip.
483,21,9,Bxc5,b'rn1qk1nr/pp1b1pp1/4p2p/2bpP3/6PP/1N6/PPP2P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -', A small combination that regains his pawn but at the cost of trading his dark squared bishop. 9...Qc7 would doubtless transpose but this is more forcing.
484,21,10,1Qd2,b'r3k2r/pp1bnpp1/2n1p2p/q2pP3/6PP/2PBBN2/PP1Q1P2/R3K2R b KQkq -', The tone of play for the middlegame is set -- Black's position is resilient but White has a promising future on the central dark squares. Fritz now wanted to try the line-opening gambit 14...d4!? but no human player would yet regard such drastic measures as necessary. (It's a mark of how far computer programs have advanced that Fritz makes this dynamic choice.)
485,21,11,1Bd4,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/2n1p1np/q2pP3/3B2PP/2PB1N2/PP1Q1P2/R3K2R b KQkq -', Accepting some exchanges but White's dark square grip persists. In contrast 15 Bxg6 gives black too much counterplay along the half-open f-file.
486,21,12,1Rac1,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/4p2p/3pP3/3P1nPP/3B1N2/PP1K1P2/2R4R b kq -', From now on White's play is direct and brutal. I would have played Bf1 and followed it with Ke3. Kramnik has no truck with such sophisticated nuances and goes directly for the jugular.
487,21,13,1h5,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/4p3/3pP2p/3P1nPP/3B1N2/PP1K1P2/2R4R w kq -', And here I would have left Black's king's-side pawns severely alone and traded on d3. After 18...Nxd3 19 Kxd3 Ke7 20 Rc7 Rab8 followed by ...Rhc8 I believe Black could withstand the onslaught from White though it must be admitted that White's knight will always be superior to Black's bishop.
488,21,14,1Rhg1,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/4p3/3pP2p/3P1nPP/3B1N2/PP1K1P2/2R3R1 b kq -', 19 g5 is possible instead but Kramnik is all for open lines.
489,21,15,2a4,b'r3k2r/1p3pp1/p1b1p3/3pP2n/PP1P3P/3B1N2/3K1P2/2R3R1 b kq a3', An admirable display of energy but after 22...Bxa4 23 Rc7 Bb5 24 Rxb7 O-O Black reduces the tension and gains counterplay. Taking the pawn could even be dangerous for White after 25 Bxb5 axb5 26 Rxb5 Ra2+. For this reason I prefer 22 Ke3 restricting Black's knight and if 22...O-O then 23 Rg5 g6 24 Rcg1 Ng7 25 h5! or if 24...Kh8 25 Bxg6! fxg6 26 Rxg6 Rf7 27 Ng5 and wins.

After this passive move Black is strangled in the style of his hero Petrosian or of Nimzowitsch the arch-blockader and early prophet of 3 e5 against the Caro-Kann.

493,21,19,Bc6,b'2k4r/1p3pp1/pPb1p3/3pP1N1/P2P3P/3K4/5P2/2R5 w - -',Black has plugged one path for White's forces but more soon open. Black we soon see is fatally debilitated on the central dark square complex.
494,21,20,Rh3+,b'3k4/1p4p1/pPbNp3/3pP3/P2P4/3K3r/5P2/6R1 w - -', Passive defence is hopeless so Black tries to clear off as many white pawns as he can. 
495,21,21,3f4,b'3k4/1p4R1/pPbNp3/3pP3/r2P1P2/8/4K3/8 b - f3', !! The decisive coup. White's small but highly efficient army is ready to concentrate its powers and deal the death blow. If now 34...Rxd4 then 35 f5 exf5 36 e6 Re4+ 37 Nxe4 fxe4 38 Rc7 threatening Rxc6 and if 37...Bb5+ 38 Ke3 when Black's b-pawn is doomed and White's king penetrates.
496,21,22,3f5,b'3k4/1p4R1/pPbNp3/3pPP2/3P2K1/3r4/8/8 b - -',The same theme. The way White's king now takes the Black fortress by storm with just rook and knight against rook and bishop reminds me strongly of the epic king march and superlative conclusion of game 5 from the Petrosian-Botvinnik WCC match Moscow 1963.
497,21,23,4Nf7+,b'3k4/1pR2N2/pPb2K2/3pPp2/7r/8/8/8 b - -', Black resigns since 41...Ke8 42 Rc8+ Kd7 43 Rd8 is 'mate. A jewel of a game and a sublime atonement for the sins of omission in some previous games of this match. Now compare the celebrated king march by Petrosian that doubtless provided inspiration for Kramnik as he conducted his final onslaught. A wonderful game.

I've decided to slow down and take a lot more time for my moves.  I've been self analyzing them more the last day but think I'm still moving too fast so I need to study them more.  Yesterday I made a move after considerable consideration then realized seconds later that I'd made an obvious mistake not taking a pawn.

Otherwise I prefer to keep my Knight a step closer to the center. However the gain of tempo in this case justifies the temporary misplacing of the Knight.

The game is basically over already but the second player slogs grimly on - thankfully because the reader will be treated to a snappy piece of drama in a little while - the only thing that made this game worth annotating.

618,27,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',ubermensch43 played this move so that I could play and get used to the Benoni Defense.  How do I know this?  He told me during this game in a game chat.  Note: this was a coaching game so there will be more conversations with the game chat before it is over.  Of course I confused the Benoni with the Kings-Indian Defense.  According to Jack Stockel the King's-Indian Defense starts with 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 or 2.Nc3.  Jack has also told me that you usually do not win with the King's Indian.  Instead it leads to a draw or loss so it is not that strong.  In addition I recently learned that the Benoni Defense is weak for Class E Ranked Players.  However I will not continue with the King's Indian because Ubermensch introduced me to the Game DB.  Of course I no longer use this database because I have had bad luck with it and International Master shamash discouraged me from using it after I figured out the problem.     
619,27,1,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/7n/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"? I made this move because it is what the Game DB suggested or so I thought.  Of course I did not understand the Database at the time and this is the first game where it has caused problems.  According to ubermensch43 this is a mistake because it is usually a bad idea to place your knight on the h or a files as it becomes less valuable and gives you less room to escape from danger.  This is btw why I was obsessed with the general fact that a knight on the rim is grim.  Of course I also know that there are exceptions and times where a knight on the rim is dim.  That basically means that there are occasions where it is a good idea to place your knight on the rim.  Afterall ""There is always an exception to everything"" as chesskingdom64 would say."
620,27,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/7n/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He played this to illustrate that it is not a good idea to place your knight on the rim.  That is what he told me.
621,27,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/7n/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',"? In this position I am trying prevent him from advancing his d4 pawn.  However he said that this is a mistake because it is a bad idea to push your pawn.  That is why I marked this with a question mark.  On the other hand Jack Stockel would ask ""Why is this bad?"" or ""What's wrong with this move""? "
622,27,4,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/7n/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Ubermensch said that he is trying to put pressure on my h6 knight in this position.  That is another reason why 1...Nh6 was weak.  
623,27,5,Ng4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p2B1/3P2n1/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',! At this point I am trying to get my knight out of danger and he said that this was a good tactical choice for that reason.
624,27,6,h3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p2B1/3P2n1/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',However he also pointed out that it could be chased with this move.
625,27,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Therefore I respond with this move because I thought that I would loose my piece either way.  However this would exchange my knight for his DSB.  Otherwise he would win a free piece.  On the other hand he is not going to take.     
626,27,8,Nbd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/5N1P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',!? I understand his intentions but I think that this was a little risky because it blocks his queen and prevents it from moving.  Therefore 5.Nc3! was best in my opinion.  According to Jack Stockel it is not a good idea to block your own pieces.
627,27,9,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p2B1/3Pn3/5N1P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',!? I figured that I would exchange knights but this is dangerous.  Why?  After he plays 6.Nxe4 his queen is free to maneuver.  Therefore I do not think that this should have been played.   
628,27,10,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/6B1/3Pp3/7P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',! In this position he had to retreat his other knight or I would take it with 7...exf3 exchanging his other knight for my e pawn.
629,27,11,f6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5p2/6B1/3Pp3/7P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',? At this point I decide to chase his DSB away.  Of course I was obsessed with chasing pieces at the time.  However he pointed out that it is a bad idea push pawns.
630,27,12,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/5p2/6p1/3PpB2/7P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq g6',I am still trying to shoe his bishop away but he pointed out the same thing about pushing pawns.
631,27,13,Qxd4,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1p2p/5p2/6p1/3qp3/6BP/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',? I decide to take one of his pawns with my queen because it looks I like have won something for free.  However this opponent pointed out that this is another mistake because he told me and illustrated that it is a violation of General Opening Principles to bring out your Queen or major pieces (rooks) early in the game as it can be chased away.  That is btw why I became obsessed with rules principles and attacking pieces.  If Mr. Stockel were here however he would say that this move is solid.  Why?  It is because of what I had mentioned in my first sentence about free material.  Jack has told me that it is a good idea to try and win free material.  This however excludes deflective sacrifices and some gambits.

634,27,16,1c5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1qp2p/5p2/2p3p1/4p3/2P1P1BP/PP1N1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq c6',?? I do not know why I played this move but it is a serious blunder according to my opponent.  Why?  It is because I will loose my chance to castle so my king will become and remain exposed throughout the rest of the game after he places me in check.  How will this take away my chance to castle?  After he checks me I will be forced to defend with my king.  Afterall he noted that it is important to have the option of castling even if you do not castle.
635,27,17,1Rd1,b'rnbk1b1r/pp1qp2p/5p2/2p3pQ/4p3/2P1P1BP/PP1N1PP1/3RKB1R b K -',His knight was protected by the king so I do not know why he moved the a1 rook.
636,27,18,1Nc6,b'r1bk1b1r/pp1qp2p/2n2p2/2p3pQ/4p3/2P1P1BP/PP1N1PP1/3RKB1R w K -',?? At this point I do not know what I was thinking.  However he accurately points out that this is my loosing blunder.  Why does this move loose?  That will be answered shortly.
637,27,19,1Nc4,b'r1bk1b1r/pp1qp2p/2n2p2/2p3pQ/2N1p3/2P1P1BP/PP3PP1/3RKB1R b K -',At this point he is going to my Queen for his Rook at best because my Queen is now pinned so the game is now lost.  Therefore I resign.  There are times when I have trouble understanding the material in chess. Then Jack Stockel tells me something but experts master and some class A ranked players tell me something different.  That has affected my performance and caused me to loose a couple of chess games.  This was one of those games.  In the Knights of Honor Chess Club I made a thread about mixed signals and IM shamash advised me to base my moves on strategic plans unless those plans weaken your position or endanger your king.

He can't let his bishop just sit there because I'll play Bxf5 and damage his kingside pawns. But I decided to wait for now. I'm not sure I want to capture Bxf5 until after he's captured because he'll just castle queenside and have a path down the g-file to attack my king. Or he might move the bishop to g4 and then I'll feel pressured to retreat the B back to e2.

674,30,5,1Nd2,b'rn3rk1/ppp1qpbp/3p1np1/3Ppb2/2P5/1PN1P3/PB1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I think e4 for him gives me the most problems at least immediately. Longer term I like that e4 gives me the d4 square for a knight. If he plays e4 the center will be all tied up so I'll start moving pawns on the queenside (since he doesn't have any pieces there.

Not sure if that helps me though. Maybe I'll move the bishop to c1 since it's not doing anything on the diagonal it's sitting on. Can he afford to trade bishops and have a hole on g7? But can he afford to let my bishop take that diagonal maybe move to e3?

I gave up a center pawn for a rook's pawn -- usually not the best idea -- and it gives him a passed pawn. Plus my pawn on a3 may tie my rook down to support it once his knight moves.
680,30,11,Ne4,b'r4rk1/1ppb3p/3p2p1/3Ppp2/1PP1nq2/P1Q2N2/5PPP/R3RBK1 w - -',I've got to push his pieces back to his side.

By the way the reason black retakes with the pawn and not the bishop is because he realizes the imbalance of white's kingside majority vs black's queenside majority. Therefore it makes more sense to get the pawns ""rolling"" rather than recapturing with a piece and blocking the pawns."
689,31,2,Bc5,b'r2qk2r/p1pb1ppp/2p5/2bpP3/3Nn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Moves like 9...c5 are bad to 10.Nb3 c6 11.f3 Ng5 12.f4 Ne4 13.f5 when black's position is horrible. The line I give is just one example of the danger of white's kingside majority.
690,31,3,1Be3,b'r2qk2r/p1pb1ppp/2p5/2bpP3/3NnP2/4B3/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Also since the position is not totally closed in the center we should make our moves towards there rather than on the flanks. Here white has another plan: The pawns of black on the queenside are trying to go forward. White does not want them to do so and tries to create a bind on the queenside and then breakthrough on the kingside with the pawn majority after black has no counterplay on the queenside.
691,31,4,1Nb3,b'1r1q1rk1/p1pb1ppp/2p5/2bpP3/5P2/1N2B3/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b - -',White's last few moves have realized the plan. Now white has full control and the pawn majority has been halted.

693,31,6,1Rae1,b'1r3rk1/p1pbqppp/1bp5/3pP3/5P2/1NQ1B3/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Now white is preparing some potential on the kingside behind his e and f pawns. As you can see when doing a plan there may not just be a single correct move. There are many possible moves that can be made. Another option here was 17.f5 rolling the majority up. In that case black could respond with 17...Qb4 or Re8.
694,31,7,1Bf5,b'1r3rk1/p1p1qppp/1bp5/3pPb2/5P2/1NQ1B3/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',Loses a pawn but black has compensation.

696,31,9,2Nc5,b'1rr3k1/p1p1qppp/1b6/2NpP3/4bP2/2Q1B3/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - -',Certainly the black move ...c5 cannot be allowed.
697,31,10,a5,b'1rr3k1/2p1qppp/1b6/p1NpPb2/P4P2/2Q1B3/1PP3PP/4RRK1 w - a6',In this position black is rather tied up. He has less space and his pieces are much less active. White is even up a pawn. However neither player has a direct way to plan. Therefore white should simply tighten up the position and put the pieces on the best squares. Slow moves like Kh1 or b3 are perfectly fine.
698,31,11,2e6,b'1rr3k1/b3qppp/2p1P3/p1Np1b2/P2B1P2/1PQ5/2P3PP/4RRK1 b - -',The black's last move just lost a pawn. Although taking is a possibility I chose to delay the recapture. The move e6 frees up potential for the rooks on the e file. Also I first intended the variation 24...fxe6 25.Nxe6?? Bxe6 26.f5 but theres a unpleasant surprise 26...Qf6! and white loses totally. But this move is still good.

Therefore Qc3 is the best move. Now if black is not careful white will put the rooks behind the a pawnand one to pressure e6 and push it up.

702,31,15,3Rc3,b'1r4k1/6pp/2p5/r1Np1b2/P4P2/1PR4P/6P1/4R1K1 b - -',In this endgame white is winning since the knight is far superior to the bishop and there is the extra pawn. The technique is very simple.

In this case the exchange is by far the most often played in the 4...c5 line Black has the option of choosing the sideline 5...cxd4!? 6.axb4 dxc3 and now not 7.bxc3?! but 7.Nf3! with good play for the pawn.

After some research I found out that the idea of this line is probably to play ...Ba6 exchanging White's strong Bishop for the 'French bishop' which is often a problem for Black but considering the continuation of this game I'm not quite sure if Black was aware of the plan in this opening.

According to the DB's this is also the main line here. It strikes at Black's g7 pawn and sets up an attack against the Black kingside.

But probably Black can't let go the g7 pawn in this variation because he doesn't have the quick counterplay like in the main line Winawer. Other moves would not be very good: 7...O-O is just castling into the storm 7...Nf5 invites 8.Bd3 attacking the knight and threatening to remove the protection of the g7 pawn with 9.Bxf5 exf5 7...Kf8 takes away Black's castling opportunity so the rook won't get into the game very soon and 7...g6 is just a weakening move. All in all I think this was the best move in the position.

Black should really seek counterplay with ...c5 at some point and this blocks off that option so Black would need at least one other move to make it possible.

725,32,18,1O-O,b'r6r/pbpkn1pp/1pn1p3/3pP1N1/3P4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R1B2RK1 b - -',?! My only inaccuracy of the game according to the computer. I realized just after I made this move that I could have taken on h7. Still this move maintains pressure and adds an extra piece to the attack so it's not disastrous or anything...
726,32,19,1Na5,b'r6r/pbpkn1pp/1p2p3/n2pP1N1/3P4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R1B2RK1 w - -',? Somehow Black seems not to realize his h7 pawn is hanging or is thinking he can get enough counterplay for it but 16...h6 was really the only good move in this position.
727,32,20,Nc4,b'r6r/pbpkn1pN/1p2p3/3pP3/2nP4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R1B2RK1 w - -',?! Way too slow. Black should take defensive action immediately with 17...Ba6! 18.Bxa6 Rxh7.
728,32,21,1Rf7,b'r6r/pbpknRpN/1p2p3/3pP3/2nP4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R1B3K1 b - -',! A very energetic and strong move. Black is virtually lost now.
729,32,22,1Rag8,b'6rr/pbpknRpN/1p2p3/3pP3/2nP4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R1B3K1 w - -',?! Wrong rook as we will see.
730,32,23,1Bg5,b'6rr/pbpknRpN/1p2p3/3pP1B1/2nP4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R5K1 b - -',! Of course. The rook can't defend both the e7 knight and g7 pawn at once. If 18...Rhg8 had been played Black had been able to play 19...Rae8 now.
731,32,24,c5,b'4r2r/pb1kn1RN/1p2p3/2ppP1B1/2nP4/P1PB2P1/2P4P/R5K1 w - c6',Finally but it allows a simple fork. However that could not be prevented anymore because 20...Rhf8 simply runs into 21.Nxf8 and the knight is pinned so 20...Ng8 is not possible.
732,32,25,2Bg6,b'3kr3/pb2n1R1/1p2p1B1/2ppP1B1/2nP4/P1P3P1/2P4P/R5K1 b - -',Another tactical blow which also wins the knight on e7 as the rook has to go away. After this Black resigned. I do think Black played below his rating but nevertheless this was a very pleasing win especially given my inexperience in this opening. I scored 3.5/8 in the tournament with 1.5/5 against the 1700+ opposition (which could also have been 3 points) so I was very happy with my performance overall and my play. This was the highest rated opponent that I have ever beaten (excluding a simul in which I beat an IM see another annotation of mine). Thanks for reading feel free to leave some comments.
733,33,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',It is best to enter the Philidor with a Pirc move order bypassing some very good lines for White.
734,33,1,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',The main line is 4.Nf3 allowing Black to transpose into the Philidor with 4...e5.  The game move is the most critical test of Black's move order.
735,33,2,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move takes us (or at least me) out of the books.  The move grabs space but takes a lot of pressure of e5 and Black's center.  Another drawback is that White falls behind in development which can explode in White's face if he gets too aggressive and allows Black to detonate the center.
736,33,3,c6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2pp1n2/3Pp3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',More or less my default move.  It opens the d8-a5 diagonal for the Queen prepares ...b5 and directly attacks White's center.  
737,33,4,fxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/3PP3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Since White is behind in development I don't think this is a good idea.
738,33,5,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/3Pn3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',7...dxe5 is the alternative and equally good.
739,33,6,dxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/4P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White has one developed piece the knight on c3 which blocks his c-pawn.
740,33,7,Bc4,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',There is no question this is bad Black gets in the thematic ...b5 with tempo allowing him to immediately follow up with ...b4 attacking White's center.   I think this is an example of the psychological aspect of the Philidor.  White perhaps feels that Black is playing a passive system and that he as all the time in the world to develop his attack against Black. 
741,33,8,b4,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/1p2P3/2NB4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',...b4 is a move that  has to be timed.  When you play ...b4 you do it to attack the center and need to have pressure against e4 in place.  No question that Black has the necessary prerequisites in place in this game.
742,33,9,cxd5,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/5n2/3pp3/1p2P3/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',White's center not only disappears but Black wins a pawn in the process. 
743,33,10,Qxd5,b'r1b1k2r/p3bppp/5n2/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black clearly has the advantage now.
744,33,11,1O-O,b'r1b1k2r/p3bppp/5n2/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Fritz gives this move a ? and recommends Ng3.   
745,33,12,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/p3bppp/5n2/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',? I miss  13...e4 which wins immediately.  
746,33,13,1Rxf6,b'r1b2rk1/p3bppp/5R2/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ2K1 b - -',I also missed this move which allows White to equalize and perhaps more.
747,33,14,1Bb7,b'r4rk1/pb2bppp/5R2/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ2K1 w - -',The rook cannot be taken because of Bxh7 ck with a discovered attack on the Queen so I protect the queen and threaten mate.
748,33,15,Bxf2+,b'r4rk1/pb3ppp/8/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1NbPP/R1B2QK1 w - -',Here Fritz recommends ...e4 and Black equalizes.   After the game move material is even I have a rook and a pawn vs. two minor pieces.  This normally favors the minor pieces.  During the game I felt that I might be able to obtain the initiative and get my rook quickly in to play.
749,33,16,Rad8,b'3r1rk1/pb3ppp/8/3qp3/1p6/3B4/PPP1NQPP/R1B3K1 w - -',I was feeling optimistic here.  I intended a rook lift to d6 thinking that the 6th rank was ideal for my rook.  Once again I overlook ...e4.
750,33,17,1Ng3,b'3r1rk1/pb3ppp/8/3qp3/1p6/3B2N1/PPP2QPP/R1B3K1 b - -',Now its too late to play ...e4 as the Bishop can escape.  I finally realize that Black's minor pieces can control the 6th rank and its not such a wonderful rank for my rook.
751,33,18,1Qd7,b'3r1rk1/pb1q1ppp/8/4p3/1p6/3B2N1/PPP2QPP/R1B3K1 w - -',Here Fritz recommends 18...f5 19. Bg5 Rde8 as better although White would still have an edge.
752,33,19,1Bg5,b'3r1rk1/pb1q1ppp/8/4p1B1/1p6/3B2N1/PPP2QPP/R5K1 b - -',Better would be Be3.
753,33,20,2Rd1,b'3r1rk1/pb1q2pp/5p2/4p1B1/1p6/3B2N1/PPP2QPP/3R2K1 b - -',White would still have a large advantage after 20.Be3 but goes for a cheap trap instead.  White is going for a discovered attack on the queen after a bishop check.
754,33,21,2Qg4,b'3r1rk1/pb4pp/5p2/4p1B1/1p4q1/3B2N1/PPP2QPP/3R2K1 w - -',Now it is Black with the large advantage.
755,33,22,2Bc4+,b'3r1rk1/pb4pp/5p2/4p1B1/1pB3q1/6N1/PPP2QPP/3R2K1 b - -',?? game ends on a blunder.
756,33,23,2Qxc4,b'3r1rk1/pb4pp/5p2/4p1B1/1pq5/6N1/PPP2QPP/3R2K1 w - -',A very ragged game with mistakes on both sides but it did give me more confidence in the opening and was a good shakedown cruise.
757,34,0,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black chooses a Scandanavian Defence out of his Anglo-Indian beginning. This somewhat-unconventional variation (more standard is 2...g6) has the advantage of delaying Bg2 if White takes on d5 (3.cxd5 Qxd5 and now 4.Nf3 is basically forced) and preparing for a strong attack on the kingside between ...Qh5 and ...Bh3.
758,34,1,h4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/7P/5NP1/PP1PPPB1/RNBQK2R b KQkq h3',?! 6.h3 is more easily defensible and prevents ...Bg4. The text indicates that White is hoping to castle kingside in short order (whereupon a pawn on h3 would be easily picked off).
759,34,2,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/6bP/2N2NP1/PP1PPPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Both players continue development. Black has a nasty attack and lots of space whereas White feels very cramped and now his d-pawn is pinned as well. Kingside castling is looking more and more dangerous but on the other hand his queenside is almost entirely undeveloped.
760,34,3,d3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/6bP/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Letting out the Bishop and offering a modicum of defense for the d-pawn--though e2 is not exactly the most reliable defender.
761,34,4,e5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p2q/6bP/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',Black marches forward making more space for himself letting his own DSB into play and threatening to march on the WK.
762,34,5,Be3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p2q/6bP/2NPBNP1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R b KQ -',White defends against ...Bc5 and attempts to relegate Black's QN to defense of a7.
763,34,6,e4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/7q/4p1bP/2NPBNP1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R w KQ -',!? This pawn of course cannot be won since White's d-pawn is pinned. However I think this move is stronger after 9...Bb4 developing connecting the Rooks and preventing White from touching that pawn at all.
764,34,7,1Ng5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/6Nq/4p1bP/2NPB1P1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R b KQ -',Another option was 10.Nh2 but I decided to keep the BQ from shifting over to the queenside while threatening to win e4.
765,34,8,1exd3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/6Nq/6bP/2NpB1P1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R w KQ -',This pawn is still untouchable but Black must be careful not to get too greedy too fast.
766,34,9,1Bxc6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2B2n2/6Nq/6bP/2NpB1P1/PP2PP2/R2QK2R b KQ -',There are three big things to notice. First once on e2 Black's pawn will have no clear path to the last rank; it will act as a bit of a shield for the WK and it will be more easily won than it would be on the d-file backed by the Black Rook. Secondly the b7 pawn and d8 Rook are only defended by the Black King and are therefore weak. Thirdly after ...dxe2 the WQ will be fighting the BR for control of the d-file. Armed with this knowledge White sets a trap with 11.Bxc6.
767,34,10,1dxe2,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2B2n2/6Nq/6bP/2N1B1P1/PP2pP2/R2QK2R w KQ -',?? Black misses White's trick thinking that he must respond to the attack on his Queen and preoccupied with his dangerous pileup on d1. Correct was 11...bxc6 12.f3 dxe2 13.Qxe2 Bd7 14.O-O-O with an unclear but probably equal position.
768,34,11,1Bxb7+,b'2kr1b1r/pBp2ppp/5n2/6Nq/6bP/2N1B1P1/PP2pP2/R2QK2R b KQ -',"! The word 'intermezzo' means ""something nasty that your opponent missed which you can do before dealing with their threat."" In this particular case it means White picks up a free Rook."
769,34,12,1Qxd8,b'3Q1b1r/pkp2ppp/5n2/6Nq/6bP/2N1B1P1/PP2pP2/R3K2R b KQ -',Black's cohesion is significantly better than White's but White is up a lot of material--if he can make it count. Unfortunately his KR is trapped in a tiny useless box and his QN is indirectly pinned by virtue of his Queen on d8--if White moves the Nc3 Black has ...Bb4+! followed by ...Rxd8.
770,34,13,1Rh2,b'3Q1b1r/pkp2ppp/5n2/6Nq/7P/2N1BbP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 b Q -',Hoping to bait Black into a very favorable exchange with 14...Ng4 15.Nxf3 Nxh2 16.Nxh2.
771,34,14,1h6,b'3Q1b1r/pkp2pp1/5n1p/6Nq/7P/2N1BbP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 w Q -',? Black needs to be avoiding exchanges not encouraging them. He should be focusing on getting his KB and KR into the fight.
772,34,15,1Qd4,b'5b1r/pkp2pp1/5n1p/8/3Q3P/2N1BqP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 b Q -',"White breaks the ""pin"" on his Knight freeing it to capture on e2 as well as defending b4 against any future Bishop aggression."
773,34,16,1Ng4,b'5b1r/pkp2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/2N1BqP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 w Q -',?! This is okay but activating the Bishop would be far better. Now the BQ is tied to this Knight's defense and Black's kingside pieces are no closer to helping the cause than they were before.
774,34,17,Kc8,b'2k2b1r/p1p2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/2N1BqPR/PP2pP2/R3K3 w Q -',Black attempts to dodge the incoming artillery. I think 17...Bd6 would have been much better; he desperately needs to get his last two pieces out.
775,34,18,1Nxe2,b'2k2b1r/p1p2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/4BqPR/PP2NP2/R3K3 b Q -',Finally this pawn can be collected. The White pieces breathe a collective sigh of relief.
776,34,19,1a5,b'2k2b1r/2p2pp1/7p/p7/3Q2nP/4BqPR/PP2NP2/R3K3 w Q a6',? ...Bb4+ doesn't accomplish anything anymore. 18...Bd3 would be a vastly superior move.
777,34,20,Bd6,b'2k4r/2p2pp1/3b3p/p7/3Q2nP/P3BqPR/1P2NP2/R3K3 w Q -',Finally but this comes several moves too late. White's forces are finally joining up and eliminating the last of Black's most dangerous threats and a storm is coming.
778,34,21,2Qd3,b'2k4r/2p2pp1/3b3p/p7/6nP/P2QBqPR/1P2NP2/R3K3 b Q -',White shores up his last weak piece and takes aim at a6. I considered 20.Qxg7?? at the time until I realized that it hangs the WQ after 20...Be5!
779,34,22,2Ne5,b'2k4r/2p2pp1/3b3p/p3n3/7P/P2QBqPR/1P2NP2/R3K3 w Q -',Black brings his Knight back towards the center but too late and without much effect--the WQ was going to move next turn anyway. Better was 20...Rd8 I think.
780,34,23,2O-O-O,b'3k3r/2p2pp1/Q2b3p/p3n3/7P/P3BqPR/1P2NP2/2KR4 b - -',With the WQ still defending the Ne2 White finally gets a chance to castle! It does little-to-nothing for his King's safety but it brings a Rook over to d1 and gets the WK out of the way allowing the White Rooks to finally connect on the back rank.
781,34,24,2Qg2,b'3k3r/2p2pp1/Q2b3p/p3n3/7P/P3B1PR/1P2NPq1/2KR4 w - -',? This move is also so late that it no longer accomplishes anything at all except to deny the BQ some of her mobility and invite White to activate his KR. Looking back this is the last time Black has a tempo to get something accomplished--by throwing it away this is probably the move that loses him the game completely. 22...Re8 looks like the best alternative to me.
782,34,25,2Rhh1,b'3k3r/2p2pp1/Q2b3p/p3n3/7P/P3B1P1/1P2NPq1/2KR3R b - -',23.Nf4 was probably more accurate.
783,34,26,2Ke7,b'7r/2p1kpp1/Q2b3p/p3n3/7P/P3B1P1/1P2NPq1/2KR3R w - -',Black breaks the pin frees the Rook and makes a run for the kingside but this square is dangerous--the White Knight can finally hop into the fray with a lot of tempo.
784,34,27,Qe4,b'7r/2p1kpp1/Q2b3p/p3n3/4qN1P/P3B1P1/1P3P2/2KR3R w - -',Basically forced.
785,34,28,Ke6,b'7r/2p2pp1/Q2bk2p/p2Nn3/4q2P/P3B1P1/1P3P2/2KR3R w - -',Black hangs another piece by walking back into this pin. His other options aren't much better though: 25...Ke8 or ...Kf8 are met by 26.Qc8# 25...Kd7 or ...Kd8 by 26.Nxc7 and the loss of the Bishop soon after.
786,34,29,2Nxc7+,b'7r/2N2pp1/Q2bk2p/p3n3/4q2P/P3B1P1/1P3P2/2KR3R b - -',"1-0. Black will now lose the Bishop as well and the game shortly thereafter. His continued delaying of developing his kingside pieces and some wasted tempo in the midgame gave White all the time needed to consolidate his far-flung position and put together a winning attack.

787,35,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

I am playing in Master Chrisobee's MT Love Conquers all and I found myself in a game where I grabbed a pawn and walked into a knight fork losing my knight for two pawns.  However I got a lot of play for that deficit thanks to my KR and Glenda.  I somehow managed to regain my piece with interest and Jo and I ended up in a K & P ending with me increasing that two pawn advantage into a 4 pawn advantage.  Jo tried to play for a stalemate but I was having none of it.  I carefully calculated at the end that I had a forced mate in 8 and announced it to my opponent who then resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  Here is how it all happened.  Here is the Gameknot Analysis version of this game which started off as a Petrov's Defense.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16936623&rnd=0.6334171524199531"

It is a hot summer's day (for once we have been having decent weather today!) the battlefield is not too far away from the sea and Henry is now thinking about having bar-be-que p(r)awns for his supper!

809,35,22,4a4,b'8/p5p1/8/1Ppk2p1/P7/1P1K3P/5PP1/8 b - -',43. a4 - with the plan of a5 and getting a passer on the a column.  Note - if I get to the stage where I am in a position to play b6 and Jo takes that pawn I will not recapture assuming the BK stays where he is.  I will simply walk the a pawn on to a8 and Glendadom!
810,35,23,Kd6,b'8/p7/3k2p1/PPp3p1/8/1P1K3P/5PP1/8 w - -',44. ..... Kd6 - black is in a zugzwang.  His king has had to retreat to avoid losing further material (yet).  This however allows Henry to move to c4 to attack his c5 pawn.  Now black cannot avoid losing further material.

813,35,26,4b5,b'8/k7/P5p1/PPK3p1/8/7P/5PP1/8 b - -',49. b5 - I intend to keep the BK confined on the back row.  But can I ensure that he cops the right kind of mate?
814,35,27,5Kd6,b'k7/8/PP1K2p1/P5p1/8/7P/5PP1/8 b - -',51. Kd6 - aha.  Yup it will be the b pawn that will inflict Glendadoom on my opponent because I then discovered after careful analysis that Old Matey will descend on Jo a few moves after Glenda's re-appearance on the board.  I announced #in 8 and Jo waved the white flag.  This victory has taken me to within 3 points of a huge milestone - 1900.

882,39,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This opening goes by a variety of names (Reti is the one I've encountered most frequently) or sometimes by no name at all--1.Nf3 is a transpositional move used in a variety of ways to avoid certain lines (generally those including an early ...e5) in other common openings. In this game for example White wants to play the English but avoid a reversed-Sicilian (1.c4 e5).
883,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',More popular are 1...Nf6 and 1...d5. With this move Black offers a transition to the main-line Sicilian (after 2.e4).

885,39,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Black makes a claim for the center before White's King's Bishop can get in the game aiming at d5. The game still has a large amount of transpositional potential; the move order is not critical. White will continue to attack the center from the wings while Black seeks to occupy it directly.
886,39,4,cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It may be stronger to play 5.Bg2 first but this move is coming sooner or later.
887,39,5,e5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/2pqp3/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',Black now has a solid foothold in the center. Even his Queen is not trivial to harass right away as the loss of White's QN restricts his options--only the Bg2 is available to attack the Queen and that only via moving his Knight to a much more marginal location (either Nh4 or (after castling) Ng5-h3 (after Black's Queen's retreat and ...h6)).
888,39,6,Qc2,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pqp3/8/5NP1/PPQPPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Both sides have continued to develop logically though White's untouched d-pawn is cramping his QB needlessly-- I think 9.d3 would have been stronger here freeing the bishop preventing ...e4 and allowing the White Knight to threaten a jump to g5 after 10.Qc2.
889,39,7,e4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4p3/5NP1/PPQPPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black creates space and forces the White Knight to make a tough decision.
890,39,8,1Ne1,b'r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4p3/6P1/PPQPPPBP/R1B1NRK1 b kq -',I think 10.Nh4 is probably better but it's understandable that White doesn't want to let Black weaken his castle with 10...Bxh4 11.gxh4. The Knight also has an easy-looking redeployment to d3 if White can get rid of the e-pawn on d3 or e4.
891,39,9,1f5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pq1p2/4p3/6P1/PPQPPPBP/R1B1NRK1 w kq f6',Black supports his overextended e-pawn. Now he needs to find time to get his Queen out of that pin and free the e-pawn to move before White manages to win it.
892,39,10,Nd4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/8/2pq1p2/3np3/3P2P1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B1NRK1 w kq -',Black does not have any other defenders for e4 but he can drive away an assailant.
893,39,11,1Qd1,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/8/2pq1p2/3np3/3P2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQNRK1 b kq -',Attempting to maintain the pressure on e4 with 12.Qb1? fails against 12...Nxe2+.
894,39,12,Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/p3b1pp/8/1ppq1p2/3np3/1P1P2P1/PB2PPBP/R2QNRK1 w - -',Getting off the long diagonal and preparing ...Bb7 for the inevitable moment when the BQ needs to leave the h1-a8 diagonal.
895,39,13,1Qd2,b'1rb2rk1/p3b1pp/8/1ppq1p2/3np3/1P1P2P1/PB1QPPBP/R3NRK1 b - -',I'm not sure about the intent behind this move. The Queen doesn't threaten anything new from d2 and if the point is to defend b2 it could wait until something actually threatened the Bishop.
896,39,14,1Nc2,b'1r3rk1/pb2b1pp/8/1ppq1p2/3np3/1P1P2P1/PBNQPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',Preparing to win a pawn by starting a bloodbath in the center.
897,39,15,1h6,b'1r3rk1/pb2b1p1/7p/1ppq1p2/3np3/1P1P2P1/PBNQPPBP/R4RK1 w - -',? Threatening ...Bg5 complicating White's attack but hanging a center pawn in the process. The defensive 16...Bf6 was probably better here.
898,39,16,1dxe4,b'1r3rk1/pb2b1p1/7p/1p1q1p2/3pP3/1P4P1/PB1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - -',Less about taking the pawn than opening the d-file.
899,39,17,1Rfd1,b'1r3rk1/pb2b1p1/7p/1p1q4/3pp3/1P4P1/PB1QPPBP/R2R2K1 b - -',Black cannot hold the d4 pawn now and when it falls e4 will be isolated and weak.
900,39,18,1Qf5,b'1r3rk1/pb2b1p1/7p/1p3q2/3pp3/1P4P1/PB1QPPBP/R2R2K1 w - -',Black finally breaks the pin maintaining control of e4 for now and putting pressure on f2.
901,39,19,2Qd4,b'1r4k1/pb4p1/5r1p/1p3q2/3Qp3/1P4P1/P3PPBP/R2R2K1 b - -',The most active way to defend f2.
902,39,20,2Rbf8,b'5rk1/pb4p1/5r1p/1p3q2/3Qp3/1P4P1/P3PPBP/R2R2K1 w - -',Black piles on but White has more than enough defense.
903,39,21,a6,b'5rk1/1b4p1/p4r1p/1p3q2/3Qp3/1P4P1/P3PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',As Black has no way to threaten f2 further he pulls his lagging pawn out of the WQ's gaze.
904,39,22,2Rac1,b'5rk1/1b4p1/p4r1p/1p3q2/3Qp3/1P4P1/P3PPBP/2R2RK1 b - -',Preparing an obnoxious presence on the seventh rank.
905,39,23,2Qg4,b'5rk1/1b4p1/p4r1p/1p6/3Qp1q1/1P4P1/P3PPBP/2R2RK1 w - -',Threatening e2 but more to the point allowing the Rooks to take the lead down the f-file and defending g7 for the inevitable attack via Rc7 and Qa7.
906,39,24,Ba8,b'b4rk1/2R3p1/p4r1p/1p6/3Qp1q1/1P4P1/P3PPBP/5RK1 w - -',Not the best place for a Bishop but it must not leave the h1-a8 diagonal or the e-pawn falls and the WB enters the game to devastating effect. 25...Bc6 is ineffective as White simply plays 26.Qb6 and the Bishop must retreat to a8 anyway.
907,39,25,2Qa7,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p4r1p/1p6/4p1q1/1P4P1/P3PPBP/5RK1 b - -',Now the BQ cannot leave her defense of g7 or mate follows in short order.
908,39,26,2h5,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p4r2/1p5p/4p1q1/1P4P1/P3PPBP/5RK1 w - -',Black must create counterplay if he is going to survive this attack. Trying to defend g7 with a Rook loses the Bishop and the game soon after (26...R6f7 27.Rxf7 Rxf7 28.Qxa8+ Rf8 29.Qxe4) so aggression is the best viable alternative.
909,39,27,2Rd1,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p4r2/1p5p/4p1q1/1P4P1/P3PPBP/3R2K1 b - -',?? I think this move almost singlehandedly loses the game for White. Driving the BQ back and away first with 27.h3 Qg6 may be safe and certainly would not be worse. This move allows the Black Rooks to drive into the heart of White's kingdom with their Queen right nearby for support and the attack is actually much deadlier than White imagines.
910,39,28,2Rf6xf2,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p7/1p5p/4p1q1/1P4P1/P3PrBP/3R2K1 w - -',?! If White now blindly continues his plan to batter down the seventh rank Black wins: 28.Rdd7?? Rxg2+! 29.Kxg2 Qxe2+ 30.Kh3 Qf1+ 31.Kh4 g5+ 32.Kxh5 Qh3+ 33.Kxg5 Rf5+ 34.Kg6 Qh5# (White can hold out somewhat longer with 33.Kg6 but his position remains hopeless).
911,39,29,2Bf3,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p7/1p5p/4p1q1/1P3BP1/P3Pr1P/3R2K1 b - -',"White cannot allow ...Rxg2+! in this situation and this move carries a surprising sting: 28...exf3 29.Qxf2 fxe2?? (thinking to win the Rook with tempo) 30.Qxf8+! Kxf8 31.Rd8#. So Black must continue another way with 29...h4 or 29...Qg5-e5 instead leading to an unclear position.

28.Rf1 is no good as 28...Rxg2+! still wins. Also ineffective is trying for an ""even"" exchange with 28.Qxf2 which should be a clear win for Black after 28...Rxf2 29.Kxf2 e3+! 30.Kf1 Bxg2+ 31.Kxg2 Qxe2+ 32.Kh3 Qxd1 and Black will soon promote for an overwhelming QQ vs R ending.

The best chance I see for White is 28.Bh3 driving the Queen away from her ridiculously powerful post on g4 and defending g2 against the Rook. 28.Re1 might barely hold as well but the Bishop move is much stronger I think."
912,39,30,2exf3,b'b4rk1/Q1R3p1/p7/1p5p/6q1/1P3pP1/P3Pr1P/3R2K1 w - -',?! 28...R2xf3 29.exf3 exf3 30.Rd2 is probably safer for Black avoiding the dangerous line mentioned earlier.
913,39,31,2Rdd7,b'b4rk1/Q1RR2p1/p7/1p5p/6q1/1P3pP1/P3Pr1P/6K1 b - -',?? Failing to play 29.Qxf2 here is catastrophic. Black has his choice of winning moves now.
914,39,32,2Rf1+,b'b4rk1/Q1RR2p1/p7/1p5p/6q1/1P3pP1/P3P2P/5rK1 w - -',"0-1. After this sacrifice White will lose in five more moves (30.Kxf1 fxe2+ 31.Ke1 Rf1+ 32.Kd2 e1=Q+ 33.Kc2 Rf2+ 34.Rd2 Qxd2+ 35.Kb1 Qb2#) and resigns. Two moves faster was 29...Rg2+ 30.Kf1 fxe2+ 31.Ke1 Qb4+ 32.Rc3 Qxc3+ 33.Rd2 Rf1# but I missed that at the time. Besides the Rook sacrifice is showier ;-)
