0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Standard opening with the queen pawn.
1,0,1,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I intended to quickly explore the mid of the board with this move.
2,0,2,Qa5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/q7/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Here i was expecting the pawn to go for d5 so i didn't quite get this move
3,0,3,Qb6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Looking for the weak pawn at b2.
4,0,4,Bc4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp2n2/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',As i didn't see the threat at b2 i kept developing my game.
5,0,5,Bxf7+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1ppBpp/2p2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PqPB1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',My point with this move was to draw out the enemy king since i felt that i had the chance to take advantage of that with the undeveloped game from the black side.
6,0,6,h6,b'rnb2b1r/pp1ppkp1/2p2n1p/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PqPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',This move didn't make much sense to me since it wouldn't help the development or the king defense at all.
7,0,7,1e5,b'rnb1kbr1/pp1pp1p1/2p2nNp/4P3/3P4/2N5/PqPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',With the goal of getting the knight out of f6.
8,0,8,Qxd4+,b'r1bk1br1/pp1pp1p1/2n3Np/3pP2Q/3q1P2/8/P1PB2PP/R4RK1 w - -',By this point i wasn't really worried with any pieces other than my knight my queen and his king so he just cleaned my side of the board as he pleased.
9,0,9,1Nxf8,b'r2k1Nr1/pp2p1p1/2n1b2p/3p3Q/8/8/P1q3PP/R4R1K b - -',Looking back i think that my opponent should have gone for Rxf8 and i probably wouldn't have the chance to win the game had he done that.
10,0,10,2Rab1+,b'r5r1/pp2p1p1/1kn1N2p/3p3Q/8/8/P1q3PP/1R3R1K b - -',My pieces start closing in on the enemy king.
11,0,11,2Qxd5+,b'r5r1/ppN1p1p1/2n4p/k2Q4/8/8/P1q3PP/1R3R1K b - -',By this time his faith was decided so we just went through the formality of playing and eventually i won.
12,0,12,2Qa4#,b'r5r1/ppN1p1p1/2n4p/8/Q7/1R6/k1q3PP/5R1K b - -',Even though we have both done a lot of mistakes i found this game really entertaining and i am really glad that at the end i come out as the winner.
13,1,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Petroff a line I play myself. This was remarkably the second time I encountered it in one week the game I played the day before (also for the external league but for another team) also started off with the Petroff I was White in that game as well.
14,1,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the variation I find the hardest to meet as Black. It's solid but White can also get a quick attack going if Black isn't careful.
15,1,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Apparently my opponent didn't know this variation. He thought for 25 minutes and came up with this dubious move. I guess he overlooked my next move...
16,1,3,Qe2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',! A slightly counter-intuitive move as it temporarily blocks in the bishop but White wins a pawn.
17,1,4,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',?! This is another inaccuracy from my opponent. After 6...Be7 Black can at least castle after the exchanges on e4 and will then start to think of getting some real compensation for his pawn deficit. 6...f5?? is far worse due to 7.d3 winning a whole knight and 6...Qe7?? is even worse than that because 7.Nxd5 not only wins a pawn but also the knight on e4 as Black has to move his queen and can't defend the knight anymore (7..Qe6?? 8.Nxc7+ wins the queen).
18,1,5,c6,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/4Q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',8...Qd5 was preferable. Now Black also gets an isolated pawn on an open file.
19,1,6,Bc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/2B1Q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I thought during the game that 9.Nd4 would accomplish the same thing (an isolated e-pawn for Black) and it but now that I think of it 9...Qd5 seems to be a good counter. The reason why I chose this move during the game was because the knight on f3 was already developed and I wanted to develop another piece.
20,1,7,Qxe6,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1q3/8/4Q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black forces an exchange of queens hoping the queenless middlegame will be easier to defend then the position with queens on the board (10...fxe6). Personally I would have chosen the latter probably.
21,1,8,Na6,b'r3k2r/pp4pp/n1pbp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Planning to defend his weak pawn with ...Nc7.
22,1,9,1Ng5,b'r3k2r/ppn3pp/2pbp3/6N1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',I'm piling up on the pawn but I can't really take it as we'll see.
23,1,10,1g3,b'r4rk1/ppn3pp/2pbp3/6N1/3P4/6P1/PPP2P1P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Now 16.Nxe6?? would have been impossible as 16...Rfe8 pins and wins the knight. However this move doesn't remove the pin. Therefore 16.Ne4 was better with a plan similar to what I played two moves later.
24,1,11,1Rae8,b'4rrk1/ppn3pp/2pbp3/6N1/3P4/6P1/PPP2P1P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Puts the rook in a passive spot. I can imagine Black didn't like the look of 16...Rad8 with a knight looking at e6 but as mentioned before I can still not take it.
25,1,12,1c4,b'4rrk1/ppn3pp/2pbp3/6N1/2PP4/6P1/PP3P1P/R1B1R1K1 b - c3',!? Fine but again 17.Ne4 was possible.
26,1,13,1h6,b'4rrk1/ppn3p1/2pbp2p/6N1/2PP4/6P1/PP3P1P/R1B1R1K1 w - -',?! Forcing me to do just what I already should have done. Up to this point we had both played rather quickly: I had 1 hour and 15 minutes left (we started with 1:40 + 10 seconds increment per move) my opponent had 1 hour and 12 minutes.
27,1,14,1Bf4,b'4rrk1/ppn1b1p1/2p1p2p/8/2PPNB2/6P1/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',! More pressure on the already cramped Black position.
28,1,15,1Bd8,b'3brrk1/ppn3p1/2p1p2p/8/2PPNB2/6P1/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',Better was 19...Rc8. This loses another pawn and is very passive.
29,1,16,Rxf4,b'3b2k1/pNn1r1p1/2p1p2p/8/2PP1r2/6P1/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',? Sacrificing an exchange... For what? Well my pawn structure on the kingside is wrecked and my strong bishop is eliminated but Black just doesn't get enough for this.
30,1,17,2gxf4,b'3b2k1/pNn1r1p1/2p1p2p/8/2PP1P2/8/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',Equally strong was 22.Nxd8!? Rf6 23.Nxc6 with three pawns more and an easy win. However I was not sure if my d4 pawn wouldn't be lost. We both had about an hour left on our clocks here.
31,1,18,2Nxd8,b'3N2k1/p1nr2p1/2p1p2p/8/2PP1P2/8/PP3P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',I didn't want the Black bishop on f6 so I decided to simply exchange it.
32,1,19,g6,b'3r4/p1n2k2/2p1p1pp/8/2PPRP2/8/PP3P1P/4R1K1 w - -',! Stiffest I think. Black can't allow f5.
33,1,20,2a4,b'3r4/2n2k2/p1p1p1pp/8/PPPPRP2/8/5P1P/4R1K1 b - a3',Trying to force a breakthrough on the queenside because the centre and the kingside are now locked. I guess Black was hoping he could hold up the queenside as well when he sacrificed the exchange. Another plan was to get the king involved: 27.Kg2.
34,1,21,Rd6,b'8/2n5/p1prpkpp/4R3/PPPP1P2/8/5P1P/3R2K1 w - -',Slowly White is making progress. Black can only sit and wait for White to do something. The computer's suggestion here is 29...Ke7. I was spending some time here I had 38 minutes left against 44 for my opponent.
35,1,22,3b5,b'8/2n5/p1prpkpp/1P2R3/P1PP1P2/8/5P1P/3R2K1 b - -',?! This doesn't throw away the win but it was not quite the right moment for this break as we will see. 30.Kg2 had to be preferred.
36,1,23,Nd5,b'8/8/3rpkpp/1P1nR3/3P1P2/8/5P1P/3R2K1 w - -',! The toughest defence establishing a strong knight threatening some forks and a pawn on f4. I can't defend it as 33.Re4?? fails to 33...Nc3 winning an exchange.
37,1,24,Rb6,b'8/8/1r2pkpp/1P1nR3/3P1P2/8/5P1P/1R4K1 w - -',! Black is accurate again. The immediate 33...Nxf4? is worse because 34.b6 creates lots of problems for Black. After 34...Rd8 35.b7 the other White rook will help the b-pawn promote.
38,1,25,3Kg2,b'8/8/1r2pkpp/1P1nR3/3P1P2/8/5PKP/1R6 b - -',Allowing the capture of the f-pawn even with check. 34.Re4?? was still impossible due to 34...Nc3.
39,1,26,3Rb2,b'8/8/1r2pkpp/1P1nR3/3P4/5K2/1R3P1P/8 b - -',To prevent forks on c3 (36.Ke4?? was impossible due to 36...Nc3+). Also this gives me the option of moving my rook to the c-file should Black move his rook off the b6 square to support my pawn in another way.
40,1,27,3Ke4,b'8/5k2/1r2p1pp/1P1nR3/3PK3/8/1R3P1P/8 b - -',Preparing my next move (I had already seen this plan around move 33 or so of course without concrete variations).
41,1,28,3Kf6,b'8/8/1r2pkpp/1P1nR3/3PK3/8/1R3P1P/8 w - -',I had expected 37...Rd6 to discourage my next move. The computer's suggestion here is 37...Ke7.
42,1,29,3Rxd5,b'8/8/1r2pkpp/1P1R4/3PK3/8/1R3P1P/8 b - -',! Sacrificing back the exchange to reach a rook ending that wins easily. I had 20 minutes left on my clock here. I suspect that Black had not expected this move given the time he took to consider the (quite obvious) reply.
43,1,30,Ke7,b'8/4k3/1r4pp/1P1K4/3P4/8/1R3P1P/8 w - -',This is why 37...Ke7 was better than 37...Kf6. Had his king already been on e7 he would have a tempo extra so he could play 39...Kd7 now to slow down my advancement.
44,1,31,4Kc6,b'1r6/4k3/2K3pp/1P6/3P4/8/1R3P1P/8 b - -',? This doesn't throw away anything but my job would have been somewhat harder if Black had now played 41...Rc8+. I should not have allowed that.
45,1,32,4Kd8,b'1r1k4/8/2K3pp/1P6/3P4/8/1R3P1P/8 w - -',? Fortunately he didn't. The rest was easy.
46,1,33,4d5,b'1r1k4/1P6/2K3pp/3P4/8/8/1R3P1P/8 b - -',Black resigned. He fought for what he was worth but the game was practically over around move 10 as he admitted afterwards. Nevertheless he gave me a run for my money and I think he deserves credits for his fighting spirit and stiff resistance in a losing position. thanks to my opponent for the game thanks to you all for reading my annotation and please leave some comments.
47,2,0,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',"This Bishop-stab is the diagnostic move of the Richter-Rauzer variation although the ""true R-R"" requires a Black Knight at c6. That niggling detail does not however mean this tweak on the ""official variation"" is any less dangerous."
48,2,1,O-O-O,b'rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',One of the two main book lines the other being 9. Qg3 placing the Lady aggressively before castling long.
49,2,2,Nbd7,b'r1b1k2r/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',A flexible move both dissuading White from pushing to e5 and setting the stage for any of about three different strategies depending on White's next.
50,2,3,gxf6,b'r1b1k2r/1pqnbp2/p2ppp1p/8/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R w kq -',!? -- This is one of the most arduous defensive variations playable in chess. -- So of course I play it as often as I can. ;-) -- Black commits himself to either castling on the Q-side (always dicey in the Sicilian) or leaving his King behind the center pawn barricade in exchange for gaining a lot of piece activity on both wings. As cramped as Black's position looks at this moment White must regroup to conjure an attack of his own. Another choice on this move was ...Bf6 which gives White a somewhat easier midgame.
51,2,4,b5,b'r1b1k2r/2qnbp2/p2ppp1p/1p6/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R w kq b6',Still all book.
52,2,5,1g5,b'r1b1k2r/2qnbp2/p2ppp1p/1p4P1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R b kq -',?! -- This move hands Black a strategic goal he plays for in this variation a powerful Knight posted on e5.
53,2,6,b4,b'r1b1k2r/2q1bp2/p2pp2p/4n1PQ/1p1NP3/2N5/PPP4P/1K1R1B1R w kq -',!? -- After the game xineohp told me he expected 15. ...Bg5. Mmm ... maybe. But the move had my spider-sense tingling after 16. h4 Be7 after which it's White who owns the g-file. I wasn't concerned about White doubling up on his h-pawns with 16. gh6: Rook pawns are weak at best and doubled Rook pawns almost doubly so.
54,2,7,Bb7,b'r3k2r/1bq1bp2/p2pp2p/4n1PQ/1p1NP3/8/PPP1N2P/1K1R1B1R w kq -',?? -- Black threatens to win the e-pawn *and* castle *and* then double Rooks on the h-file. If White plays 17. Ng3 his own steed blocks the g-file. All great ... except for 17. Ne6!! after which Black can hang up the towel. The right move was 16. ...Bd7.
55,2,8,1Bh3,b'r3k2r/1bq1bp2/p2pp2p/4n1PQ/1p1NP3/7B/PPP1N2P/1K1R3R b kq -',?? -- Returning the favor. As per the previous note 17. Ne6 is devastating.
56,2,9,Kb8,b'1k1r3r/1bq1bp2/p2pB2p/4n1PQ/1p1NP3/8/PPP1N2P/1K1R3R w - -',"""Box."" Not 18. ...fe6  19. Ne6 and Black really has no particularly useful square for his Queen."

58,2,11,Bxe4,b'1k1r3r/2q1bp2/p2pB3/4n1p1/1p1Nb3/6Q1/PPP1N2P/1K1R3R w - -',Now trying to drop the White N on e6 is no longer practical because of the threat of check at c2. The double-blunder at the 16th and 17th moves has touched off some serious fireworks with both players have attacking chances. 
59,2,12,Bxc2+,b'1k1r3r/2q1bp2/p2pB3/4n1p1/1p1N4/6Q1/PPb1N2P/1K1R1R2 w - -',?! -- Okay it's *not* an easy continuation to see and this *was* a speed game and both of us *were* getting short of time by now ... but these are not sufficient excuses. Black now misses the chance to put the game away with 21. ...fe6!!  22. Ne6 Qc2  23. Ka1 Nc4!  24. Rb1 Qe2  25. Rf2 Qe3!  26. Nd8 Bd8 and Black has 3 minor pieces for the Rook and on the next move will either win back his Exchange (remaining 2 pieces up) or will trade Queens. If White plays Qe3?? then ...Ne3 threatens a smothered mate *and* gives Black time to win back the Exchange.
60,2,13,fxe6,b'1k1r3r/2q1b3/p2pp3/4n1p1/1p6/6Q1/PPN1N2P/1K1R1R2 w - -',Black is 2 joined passed pawns ahead now and has a winning endgame if he just throttles back and consolidates.
61,2,14,Qb7,b'1k1r3r/1q2b3/p2pp3/4n1p1/1p1N4/6Q1/PP2N2P/1K1R1R2 w - -',"? -- 23. ...Qd7 is perfectly playable but the ""plakh tau"" - the Vulcan blood fever (lol!) - must have been upon me because I'm still looking for a knockout that's no longer there."
62,2,15,Rh5,b'1kr5/4b3/p2pN3/4n1pr/1p1Nq3/6Q1/PP5P/K2R1R2 w - -',?! -- The text eyes doubling the Rooks on the h-file which is not a bad idea; but 26. ...Rc4 is better because it keeps Black's play boiling around White's King.
63,2,16,Qb7,b'1kr5/1q2b3/3pN3/p3n1p1/1P1N4/1Q6/1P5r/K2R1R2 w - -',I was desperately short of time through this part of the game but I'm still at a loss to suggest better for Black.
64,2,17,g4,b'8/1k2b3/3pN3/P3n3/3N2p1/KP2r3/8/5R2 w - -',? -- 36. ...Nc6! with a probable draw after 37. Nc6 Kc6  38. Nd4 Kb7 and now White has to worry about his Knight before he can advance the pawns.
65,2,18,Kxc6,b'8/4b3/2kpN3/P7/K5p1/1P2r3/8/5R2 w - -',The difference here being significantly that White's King is a step closer now.
66,2,19,Kd7,b'8/3kb3/3p4/P7/K2N2p1/1P2r3/8/5R2 w - -',?? -- An insane time-pressure blunder. Absolutely necessary was 39. ...Kb7. After 40. Rf7 Ka6.
67,2,20,Rxe7,b'8/3kr3/8/P2p4/KP4p1/8/8/5R2 w - -',?? -- The final time pressure blunder and more than enough. After ...Ke7 Black should still draw being able to shepherd his own pawns while slowing the advance of White's. The rest of the game passes without need for further comment.
68,2,21,5Rd7+,b'8/1PkR4/P7/6r1/2K5/6p1/8/8 b - -',!! - The coup de grace.
69,2,22,5a7,b'3k4/PQ6/8/6r1/2K5/8/6p1/8 b - -',Black resigns. Not a perfect game by any means by either player but made all the more exciting *because* of the errors. Kudos to White for hanging in there! Very nice win!
70,3,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',i.e. how NOT to play the Bird opening. REally nothing too much to say about this game just a trap I fell into just 7 moves in...
71,3,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I'd never seen this response to the Bird opening before...
72,3,2,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',...nor this one but I never like to go pawn-hunting too early on - if you can't deal with the developmental advantage that your opponent gains you'll be in a lot of trouble! 
73,3,3,exd6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2nP4/8/8/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',!? Change of plan from me - it's not a bad move really but perhaps I ought to have stuck with my plan?
74,3,4,g5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/6p1/8/2N2N2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq g6',Very strange move I thought at the time. Checking the database on this one only a small handful of GK games reached this position. 6.g3 was played by all but one person...
75,3,5,d3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/6p1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',...who played this move. My logic was to retreat and play Nd2 should the pawn advance happen. Good plan?
76,3,6,Nd2,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6p1/2NP4/PPPNP1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',?? Definitely not! The problem was that I never like pushing my knight forward in most openings - it just seems too vulnerable! In a way it still is in this opening (7.Ng5 f5! wins the knight eventually though equality may still be reached - three pawns for the knight) and 7.Ng1 doesn't make White's position that pretty but as it turns out this one is suicidal!
77,3,7,Qh4+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6pq/2NP4/PPPNP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Yup!
78,3,8,Qxg3+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6p1/2NP2q1/PPPNP2P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Bxg3+ also works but this is prettier!
79,3,9,Bxg3#,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2n5/8/6p1/2NP2b1/PPPNP3/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Quick game horrid mistake and mated in 9 moves. That's all folks!
80,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A very fine first move.
81,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',A fine move as well.
82,4,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Hmm not too bad; I'd have gone Nf3. I don't really like blocking my c-pawn in this type of White-setup.
83,4,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This could turn into the Caro-Cann. Via e4.

113,5,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Here we have the Scandinavian defence. This defence is somewhat dubious as it gets the queen out early but there is no refutation to this so it's fine for black.
114,5,1,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Develops the knight with tempo
115,5,2,Qa5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is arguably the best square the queen go to. The other variation is where the queen moves to d6 which does not accomplish much.
116,5,3,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Strikes the weak f7 square. 4.d4 is the main line and is much better.
117,5,4,Bg4,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/q7/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black now seizes the initiative.
118,5,5,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black has a more comfortable position. Black has more space and has already castle whereas mot of my pieces are confined to the first 2 ranks.
119,5,6,1Bd2,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/q6b/8/2NP1N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A discovered attack on the queen. It as very little space to move around in now.
120,5,7,Qe5,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/4q3/8/2NP1B1P/PPPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Threatens a battery mate on h2.
121,5,8,1g3,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/4q3/8/2NP1BPP/PPPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The only move to prevent it. This severely weakens the king side and black should have an easy job of hacking through my kingside with moves like h4h5 or g4g5.
122,5,9,1Nd4,b'2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/4q3/3n4/2NP1BPP/PPPB1P2/R2Q1RK1 w - -',If I was black here I would start the attack by playing g5 immediately.
123,5,10,g5,b'2kr2nr/ppp2p1p/3bp3/4q1p1/3n4/2NP2PP/PPPB1PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - g6',It is a good position for black. Black has an attack coming up.
124,5,11,Qg7,b'2kr2nr/ppp2pqp/3bp3/6p1/3n4/2NP2PP/PPPB1PB1/R2QR1K1 w - -',! The best square available. This move supports the pawn push to g4 and does not obstruct the f pawn.
125,5,12,1Ne4,b'2kr2nr/ppp2pqp/3bp3/6p1/3nN3/3P2PP/PPPB1PB1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Threatens blacks major attacking piece and forces it off the useful diagonal.
126,5,13,Nd6,b'2kr2nr/ppp1bpqp/3np3/6p1/4N3/3P2PP/PPPB1PB1/R2QR1K1 w - -',At this point I was hoping black would take the bait on b2 so I could then play Bc3 forking the rook and queen but as I expected my opponent was wary of all of my plans.
127,5,14,f6,b'2kr2nr/ppp1b1qp/3npp2/6p1/4N3/2BP2PP/PPP2PB1/R2QR1K1 w - -',Now black has adapted a somewhat passive position as I gain some counterplay. I would've definetely played bf6 and then after a few exchanges black could've cotinued the attack.
128,5,15,1Qf3,b'2kr2nr/ppp1b1qp/3npp2/6p1/4N3/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 b - -',A strong move which threatens a mate if nothing is done in the future.
129,5,16,1Nb5,b'2kr2nr/ppp1b1qp/4pp2/1n4p1/4N3/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 w - -',19....Nxe4 was far better. After 20. Qxe4 c6. Black will only be down by a pawn.
130,5,17,2Nc5,b'2kr2nr/ppp1b1qp/4pp2/1nN3p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 b - -',This is a poisoned knight. If black plays 20.... Bxc5 then 21. Qxb7+ Qc6+ 22.Kc8 Qxb5 racking up more material with a strong attack.  Now somehow white has turned the tables and has a powerful attack!
131,5,18,2c6,b'2kr2nr/pp2b1qp/2p1pp2/1nN3p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 w - -',A possibility to prevent Qxb7. Another option was Nd6 I think both were just as worse. From this point in I was in a strong attacking position. 
132,5,19,2Nxb7,b'2kr2nr/pN2b1qp/2p1pp2/1n4p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R3R1K1 b - -',"! White smashes through blacks defences. If 21.... Kxb7 then 22. Qxc6+ Kb8 23. Qb7+#

134,5,21,2Rxe6,b'2k3nr/pN2b1qp/2p1Rp2/1n1r2p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R5K1 b - -',! White infiltrates blacks position.
135,5,22,2Kxb7,b'6nr/pk2b1qp/2p1Rp2/1n1r2p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R5K1 w - -',A disaster! Black king is now of the dangerous a8-h1 diagonal and now Rxc6 can be played!
136,5,23,2Rxc6,b'6nr/pk2b1qp/2R2p2/1n1r2p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R5K1 b - -',!! White finally smashes through all of blacks defences! 
137,5,24,2Kxc6,b'6nr/p3b1qp/2k2p2/1n1r2p1/8/2BP1QPP/PPP2PB1/R5K1 w - -',"? A blunder. This move loses on the spot. 24.Qxd5+ Kc7
25.Ba5+  Kc8/b8 26. Qb7+#"
138,5,25,2Ba5+,b'6nr/p1k1b1qp/5p2/Bn1Q2p1/8/3P2PP/PPP2PB1/R5K1 b - -',Black resigns here knowing the future mate. I hope you enjoyed!

Many moons ago a Class C player called Fiver played the Allgaier Gambit of the KGA and lost.  Ardin also tried that on me and met the same fate.  So how did this happen?  Please see the Gameknot Analysis link below:-

Thankfully on both occasions the Class C players tried this on me Henry managed to find some way of preserving his modesty and I was able to turn the tables on them big time!
204,9,5,Kxf7,b'rnbq1bnr/pppp1k2/7p/8/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQ -',6. ..... Kxf7 - Ah Henry - he often goes into battle and ends up trying to find ways of getting new clothing - poor old chappie!

I now have an idea of attacking the WK who exposes himself further on the next turn with a normal developing move such as Nc6.

Ardin moves his bishop to h3 and I do not take the rook because there is a bigger fish fit for Henry's table to fry - a white p(r)awn on d4 and the WK must part company with his other half on the next turn.  Ardin spares that ill-fated Royal couple the agony by waving the white flag.  I think the Allgaier is playable but white must be precise to avoid incurring a calamity do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

It is not an aggressive move I admit but our kings are face to face here off color to attack from oppositional bishops. One bishop is always dedicated to one color and that makes it difficult when you have a bishop and the other has a bishop...

327,12,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',After I decline it he responds by bringing out his Knight.  Believe it or not Jack Stockel has told me that this move is standard right after the Queen Gambit gets declined.
328,12,2,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is the interesting part.  I decide to take his pawn initially transposing the QGD into the QGA.  That is because he is going to win that pawn back.  As we all know in the QGA black often does not allow white to keep the extra pawn.
329,12,3,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now he is going to win that pawn but as Master elyhim mentioned in my last annotation this is a very big mistake that black can take advantage.  
330,12,4,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq b6',In my protect it this gets played.  Note: he did not play 4.a4 so I did not see how he could get the pawn back.  However he is somehow gonna manage to do that.
331,12,5,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq a3',Now he decides to play a4 but it should have been too little too late.  However he is lucky that it isn't as I am about to make my first mistake.
332,12,6,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP2b1/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',() This is it.  I decide to pin his f4 Knight so this is my first mistake.  However this is very minor because even if I had played ...bxa4 he would still win back the pawn because if 5...bxa4 6.Rxa4.  Sooner or later he would have been able to play Bxd4 so there would be nothing that I could do to keep it.
333,12,7,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP2b1/4PN2/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',But first he has other goals to break my pin.  And he wants to do more then just break a pin.  What is it?  In this position he eventually intends to castle Kingside as we shall see later on.
334,12,8,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/1p6/P1pP2b1/4PN2/1P2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Right now my only goal is to castle sooner or later.  Note: as mentioned in the beginning I do not want cheapos or tricks so I am only interested in developing and castling.  Of course however is the fact that I will have to pull one or two tricks in order to castle not to mate in one because I also think that he is trying to stop me from castling.
335,12,9,b3,b'rn1qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/1p6/P1pP2b1/1P2PN2/4BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',First he wants to stop me from developing by trying to win my c pawn but I am not falling for it.  Therefore I will not hesitate to force a pawn exchange.
336,12,10,g6,b'rn1qkb1r/p3pp1p/2p2np1/1P6/3P2b1/1p2PN2/4BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"Now I could have forced another exchange with 8...cxb5 9.Bxb5 given that his LSB is no longer pinned.  However I am not going to do that as it resorts to a little bit of unsound aggression.  Instead I am just going to develop my DSB as my opponent is still trying to stop me from developing and I will not stopped.  Afterall development is one of the most important aspects of chess.  As schakerertjie would say ""Your main goal is to develop develop develop""."

In other words I give two things away and allow myself to go from a pawn ahead to a pawn behind.  Why?  Because I now have the opportunity to castle Kingside and I will take advantage of that opportunity while it exists.  Afterall opportunities only exist for a finite amount of time.  BTW people argue that loosing material is worse then not developing or castling.  I disagree with this assessment and believe that proper development and castling is more important.  In fact I heard about a player grege79 sacking a piece to prevent his opponent from castling and that is how we won that game.  However no one was going to stop me from doing that.

340,12,14,1Bc4,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2P1bnp1/8/2BP4/1Q2PN1P/5PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Now he is looking to exchange so I will make that exchange as this benefits my position.

Well ""There is always an exception to everything"" as chesskingdom64 would say and this is certainly one of them.  Why?  In this position I want to win back a pawn by continuting with proper develop.  That way everything is even and I can connect my rooks.  That would not be feasible if the Queen was not on the c file.  Because of this move I will win it back after he castles Kingside.  So far I have only made a ""fender bender"" which=a small error nothing serious or big.  In fact I feel that this is one of my best games against a strong player and the best one on this site.  In addition I intend to keep it that way."
342,12,16,1Nc3,b'r4rk1/p1q1ppbp/2n2np1/8/2QP4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Although everything is even after this move I feel that I have a slight edge because I am a little more developed.  Note: his development is not quite complete yet because he still has his DSB on c1.  However that will soon change as we will see shortly.
343,12,17,1Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/p1q1ppbp/2n2np1/8/2QP4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',In the meantime I decide to take advantage by connecting my rooks.
344,12,18,1Ba3,b'r1r3k1/p1q1ppbp/2n2np1/8/2QP4/B1N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',This is where the slight edge changes so that noone has the edge.  Why?  In this position he has just completed development given that his DSB has just moved.  I originally thought that he was attacking e pawn but it is not under attack.  Why?  It turns out that e7 is protected by my my c6 Knight.
345,12,19,1Na5,b'r1r3k1/p1q1ppbp/5np1/n7/2QP4/B1N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 w - -',In the meantime I am only interested in a Queen exchange and that is why I placed my Knight on the Rim.  In some cases a Knight on the rim is beneficial.  The thing is that I was told by a Class A Ranked player that exchanging Queens often benefits your position against a stronger player.  He told me that this is a way to win a chess game.  In the meantime my opponent is also interest in trading Queens so he will accept this exchange.
346,12,20,1Bb4,b'r5k1/p1r1ppbp/5np1/n7/1B1P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',But there is one drawback to my last move.  What is it?  He decides to kick my Knight.  Now I have to retreat it.  In this case however tempo loss is not as bad given that I am already completely developed.
347,12,21,1Nc6,b'r5k1/p1r1ppbp/2n2np1/8/1B1P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 w - -',So I decided to retreat it in the best spot as this fork his LSB and d pawn.  Note: before I decide to play a Knight fork I ask myself if this will really benefit and if it's worth doing.  Although it does not provide real benefits it was worth doing because I now know that my Knight is safe and cannot be attacked.
348,12,22,1Bc5,b'r5k1/p1r1ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',At one glance I thought that he was trying to attack my e7 pawn.  However it is still protected by my Knight.
349,12,23,1a6,b'r5k1/2r1ppbp/p1n2np1/2B5/3P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now I am only thinking about promoting my a6 pawn into a Queen.  Of course I know that he is not going to allow this.  But the pawn is protected by my a8 Rook.
350,12,24,2Rfb1,b'r5k1/2r1ppbp/p1n2np1/2B5/3P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/RR4K1 b - -',Of course he decides to connect his Rooks and my goal is to prevent him from playing 21.Rb6 as he will win that a6 pawn.  Why?  If 21.Rb6!! He has another rook to take a6 so if 22.Rxa6 Rxa6 23.Rxa6 so he wins a free Rook.  Therefore I have to defend a6.
351,12,25,2Nd7,b'r5k1/2rnppbp/p1n3p1/2B5/3P4/2N1PN1P/5PP1/RR4K1 w - -',?? I thought that this was the best way to do that.  However this my first serious mistake and is in fact the loosing blunder even with best play.  In this position 20...e6 was best.  I would loose that pawn but he is going to something much worse.  What is it?  Well this move traps my c7 Rook.  No matter what happens he is going to win it.  With best it will not be an even exchange.  Otherwise that Rook is free.  Therefore this is one of those games where I just went from a minor flaw to loosing in one move.  If I had not made this error the game might have ended in a draw.  Afterall I had a shot at it.
352,12,26,2Nd5,b'r5k1/2rnppbp/p1n3p1/2BN4/3P4/4PN1P/5PP1/RR4K1 b - -',He decides to take advantage by forking e7 and my Rook.  Afterall he is going to take the Rook but I am not giving it away for free.  Instead I am going to exchange it with his LSB. 
353,12,27,Ra7,b'6k1/r1N1ppbp/p1n3p1/2n5/3P4/4PN1P/5PP1/RR4K1 w - -',? This is another mistake.  My only goal is to attack his Knight because he took my Rook.  The only thing is that I forgot that it was already with his LSB.  Therefore we could have exchanged Knights and that would have benefited as he is ahead.  However he is not going to do that.  Instead he is going to retreat but I am going to do the same with my Knight.  Afterall I am not giving him gifts.  In other words that Knight is not free.
354,12,28,2Rb6,b'6k1/r3ppbp/pRn3p1/3N4/3P4/3nPN1P/5PP1/R5K1 b - -',Little did I realize that he was going to attack this Knight.  However I do not want to retreat because it is only safe if I undevelop and I do not like undo my development.  On the other hand that would have been the best thing to do in this position.  Because that Knight is now for free so I inadvertently gave him a gift.  In addition this also gives him the opportunity to threaten mate in one.
355,12,29,Ra8,b'r5k1/4ppbp/2R3p1/p2N4/3P4/3nPN1P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',At this point I originally thought that mate could have also been prevented 25...e7.  A second look at the position however tells me that this is not the case as he will use his Knight to place me in check.  Therefore this move was indirectly forced. 
356,12,30,Kf8,b'r4k2/4Npbp/2R3p1/p7/3P4/3nPN1P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',In this position my only other choice was 26...Kh8.  However that would leave my K in a more dangerous environment as it would be stuck in only one corner.

Therefore I believe that it is safe to resign even though I do not like to resign immediately.  That is because of what you saw in my last annotation when Jack Stockel said ""Don't give up right away"".  On the other hand I know when a game is already lost and this is one of those times because I do not stand a chance at this point."
358,12,32,Nb4,b'2N2k2/5pbp/6p1/p7/1n1P4/4PN1P/5PP1/R5K1 w - -',At this point I decide to make a random move hoping to stay in the game but it will not work.  After he takes I resign.

For example I had to give him a free pawn in order to castle.  I also would have kept my chance at a draw if I gave him my a6 pawn as it would have protected my Rook.  That is what I learned from this game and it is also the moral of this story.

467,16,17,Kxe7,b'r1b4r/pp2kppp/2p5/8/4n3/6P1/PPP2P1P/R3KB1R w KQ -',A esta altura estoy con pieza de más.
468,16,18,1Bd3,b'r1b4r/pp2kppp/2p5/8/4n3/3B2P1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ -',El blanco que ya debió haber abandonado decide seguir y atacar mi caballo con su alfil presionando también sobre h7.
469,16,19,1Nc5,b'r1b4r/pp2kppp/2p5/2n5/8/3B2P1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ -',Cc5 buena. Retirando el caballo y atacando al alfil.

471,16,21,Re8,b'r1b1r3/pp2kppp/2p5/8/8/3R2P1/PPP2P1P/2K4R w - -',Esta jugada la pensé un rato y jugadas más tarde me arrepentí. Lo correcto según la teoría de Capablanca hubiese sido Td8 ofreciendo el cambio de torres para seguir simplificando la posición y si el blanco no acepta el cambio yo ganaba la columna abierta d. Pero no mi idea era un poco diferente. Mi plan era conseguir un enroque forzado llevando en un futuro mi rey a f8 y ganando la columna e con la torre y hacer los cambios de torre sobre esa columna. Veamos como sigue la partida.
472,16,22,1Re1+,b'r1b1r3/pp2kppp/2p5/8/8/3R2P1/PPP2P1P/2K1R3 b - -',Evidentemente el blanco da jaque con la torre en e1.
473,16,23,1Be6,b'r3r3/pp2kppp/2p1b3/8/8/3R2P1/PPP2P1P/2K1R3 w - -',Aca habían 2 opciones: retirar el rey a f8 y cambiar las torres lo que no me hace ganar la columna e que es lo que quiero lograr o bien jugar Ae6 cubriendo el jaque y presionando sobre el peón desprotegido de a2. Me decanté por esta última ya que es más agresiva y va más con mi estilo de juego.
474,16,24,1f4,b'r3r3/pp2kppp/2p1b3/8/5P2/3R2P1/PPP4P/2K1R3 b - f3',Las blancas comienzan un ataque por el flanco con f4.

477,16,27,1Bxa2,b'r3rk2/pp3ppp/2p5/8/5P2/4R1P1/bPP4P/2K1R3 w - -',Y este error podría haberme costado caro. Si el blanco hubiese seguido con b3 mi alfil queda encerrado y sería muy dificil de salvar. Afortunadamente la moral de mi rival estaba ya por el suelo y no vio la celada.
478,16,28,1Re3xe8+,b'r3Rk2/pp3ppp/2p5/8/5P2/6P1/bPP4P/2K1R3 b - -',"El blanco se tira al cambio de torres. Aca me asusté un poco. Mi razonamiento fue este: El blanco vio mi error en a2 y ahora esta tratando de simplificar la posición para después jugar b3 ganar mi alfil y tratar de igualar la posición. Viendo como estaba el panorama me dije: ""bueno seguramente esto termina en tablas""."
479,16,29,Kxe8,b'4k3/pp3ppp/2p5/8/5P2/6P1/bPP4P/2K5 w - -',Se cambian las torres y se simplifica la posición. Si mi alfil cae el final será muy complicado y hay mucha posibilidad de tablas.
480,16,30,2c3,b'4k3/pp3ppp/2p5/8/5P2/2P3P1/bP5P/2K5 b - -',Grande fue mi sorpresa al ver esta jugada. El blanco no ve la celada y juega c3 convirtiendo mi error de Axa2 en una buena jugada. La partida aca esta ganada.
481,16,31,2Bb3,b'4k3/pp3ppp/2p5/8/5P2/1bP3P1/1P5P/2K5 w - -',Mi alfil toma una muy buena ubicación en b3.
482,16,32,Kd7,b'8/pp1k1ppp/2p5/8/5P2/1bP3P1/1P1K3P/8 w - -',Comienza la carrera de los reyes por el control del centro fundamental en el final.

484,16,34,Ke6,b'8/p4ppp/2p1k3/1p6/4KP2/1bP3P1/1P5P/8 w - -',Esta jugada pierde un tiempo hubiese sido mejor seguir con el ataque de peones.

489,16,39,c5,b'8/5ppp/3k4/2p2PP1/1p3K1P/8/1Pb5/8 w - -',Sigue mi ataque.

493,16,43,3Kd5,b'8/5p1p/5PpP/3k2P1/1pp2K2/8/1Pb5/8 w - -',Aca la clave esta en ganar espacio con el rey.
494,16,44,bxc3,b'8/5p1p/5PpP/3k2P1/8/2p1K3/2b5/8 w - -',Si nos fijamos hay una barrera formada por el peon el alfil y el rey. El rey blanco no se puede acercar.

497,16,47,Bd3+,b'8/5p1p/5PpP/6P1/8/2pb4/3k4/5K2 w - -',Retiro mi alfil para que el peon pueda avanzar y gano un tiempo atacando al rey blanco.
498,16,48,c2,b'8/5p1p/5PpP/6P1/8/3b4/2pk1K2/8 w - -',Camino despejado ¡A coronar!
499,16,49,4Kf4,b'8/5p1p/5PpP/6P1/5K2/3b4/3k4/2q5 b - -',Blanco sigue jugando mal y pone el rey en la diagonal de mi rey y dama.

Espero les halla gustado esta partida."
502,17,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I was anticipating a pirc style defense from black after this move however this was not the case. 
503,17,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I believe this is a bit of a concession form the usual Nf6.  Though this could be a different move order say Nf3 Nf6.
504,17,2,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1ppp4/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? Now this is a real concession as it just looks like my opponent is just pushing pawns...
505,17,3,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3ppp1/1ppp1n1p/4P3/3P1B2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I'm under the option I should have waited to make this move for at least a move or two.  Maybe after Nc3 or something.
506,17,4,a3,b'rn1qkb1r/p3ppp1/1ppp3p/3nP3/3P2b1/P2B1NB1/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This seems to be an odd move but my goal is to kick out the d5 knight with c4 and I don't want it coming to b4.
507,17,5,1Nc3,b'r2qkb1r/p2nppp1/1pp4p/3nP3/3PB1b1/P1N2NB1/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Attacking the well placed knight.
508,17,6,f5,b'r2qkb1r/p2np1p1/1pp4p/4Pp2/3PB1b1/P1P2NB1/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq f6',? this does nothing for blacks game in fact white had the very strong exf6 e.p. but I missed that in the game because I liked Bxc6 and hadn't even considered exf.
509,17,7,Rxc6,b'3qkb1r/p2np1p1/1pr4p/3PPp2/6b1/P1P2NB1/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQk -',Black could no longer deal with the mounting problems as e6 was coming.  So he sacs the rook.
510,17,8,1Qxd8+,b'3Qkb1r/p3p1p1/1pP4p/2n1Pp2/6b1/P1P2NB1/5PPP/R3K2R b KQk -',I trade down to free my knight from the pin however gameknot considers this a mistake over e6.  I however don't see much of a gain out of e6 Nxe6 maybe the idea is that it gives the dsb more life.
511,17,9,2Nb5,b'3k1b1r/p5p1/1pP1p2p/1Nn1Pp1b/8/P1P2PB1/6PP/R3K2R b KQ -',I think this wasn't a very good move I had thought to play Nd6 but it doesn't quite work in the current case.  I should have been patient and play O-O-O which would have closed the black knight of the position and threatens a various amount of discoveries on the king. 
512,17,10,Bxc6,b'5b1r/2k3p1/p1b1p2p/Ppn1Pp2/3N4/2P2PB1/6PP/2KR3R w - -',I figured this pawn would fall at some point.
513,17,11,2Kb2,b'5b1r/6p1/p1k1p2p/Ppn1Pp2/8/2P2PB1/1K4PP/3R3R b - -',Defending against Nb3.
514,17,12,2Bf2,b'5b1r/1n4p1/p1k1p2p/Pp2Pp2/8/2P2P2/1K3BPP/3R3R b - -',I should have defended my pawn with Ra1 but I had it in my head that I would be okay after Rd8?? but I was wrong and you'll see why here in a minute.
515,17,13,Ba3+,b'3R3r/6p1/p1k1p2p/np2Pp2/8/b1P2P2/1K3BPP/7R w - -',!! I've gone from being at the advantage slightly to a losing position in one move :/.  The a6 pawn is going to be a big issue.
516,17,14,3Bd4,b'3r4/6p1/p1k1p2p/np2Pp2/3B4/K1P2P2/6PP/7R b - -',Blocking out the rook which could be a real problem if I let it into my position.
517,17,15,g5,b'3r4/8/p1k1p2p/1p2Ppp1/2nB4/1KP2P2/6PP/7R w - g6',A good move as it makes it difficult to begin queen side play.
518,17,16,3Ra2,b'3r4/8/2k1p2p/pp2Ppp1/2nB4/1KP2P2/R5PP/8 b - -',plugs up the knight moves such as Nd2 so I can play something like g4-g3.
519,17,17,3Bxb6,b'1r6/8/1Bk1p2p/1p2Ppp1/pK6/2P2PP1/R6P/8 b - -',Trading my bad bishop for good knight however this isn't going to help me much.
520,17,18,3c4,b'8/8/1rk1p2p/1p2Ppp1/pKP5/5PP1/R6P/8 b - -',Not sure I like this move very much something like Rd2 looks much better.  However my idea was to try to keep the king away from the queen side.
521,17,19,4Kb4,b'8/8/rk2p2p/4Ppp1/pK6/R4PP1/7P/8 b - -',? I think trying for a queen side break would be better here say f4 so Ra5 doesn't come with tempo.
522,17,20,4Rf3,b'8/8/1k2p2p/3rPp2/pK3P2/5R2/7P/8 b - -',Now here is a point where I have to disagree with the computer analysis after Rxa4 Rd4+ Kb3 Rxa4 Kxa4 Kc5 I have no way to stop him from dropping my f4 pawn and I'm going to lose.  I figured keeping the rooks on the board was my only chance for a draw.
523,17,21,4Rh3,b'8/8/4p2p/1k2Pp2/p2r1P2/K6R/7P/8 b - -',Here I decide that I should try to make some things happen maybe if I can trade off a few pawns I'll be able to distract black from getting the a pawn down the board.
524,17,22,Kb4,b'8/8/4p2R/4Pp2/pk6/5r2/K6P/8 w - -',pushing me back.
525,17,23,4Rxe6,b'8/8/4R3/4Pp2/pk6/5r2/K6P/8 b - -',!? the only move that I can think of that can cause the position to change quite a bit.
526,17,24,Rxh2,b'8/8/4R3/4Pp2/pk6/8/7r/1K6 w - -',Black takes my pawn and I can't say I'm surprised.
527,17,25,5Rb6+,b'8/8/1R6/4Pp2/pk6/8/7r/1K6 b - -',I play this move to make black commit his king.
528,17,26,Re2,b'8/8/R7/2k1Pp2/p7/8/4r3/1K6 w - -',I think allowing this pawn to drop is a big mistake as it is going to make defending much easier.  However it will be hard to defend the pawn and deal with my advancing e pawn as well.
529,17,27,5Rf4,b'8/8/8/2k1rp2/5R2/8/8/1K6 b - -',I offer a draw here because i believe that I have a really good chance at getting a draw in this position.  My opponent accepts my offer and I can't say I wasn't glad this game ended in a draw.
530,18,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',King's pawn open.  My default.
531,18,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Apparently this is called the Robatsch defence but I'm not very familiar with it.
532,18,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I wanted to protect the main diagonal because I've gotten burned and lost my rooks early in some previous games.  Planning on playing 3.d4
533,18,3,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I found this to be an odd move.  This does open up the light diagonal but it's already closed off by my pawn on e4.
534,18,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Now I take control of the center squares and free up my dark bishop.
535,18,5,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Again I don't really get this move.  He may be trying to force me to protect my pawn but it really accomplishes very little.
536,18,6,Nd2,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Protecting my pawn.  In hindsight 4.f3 probably was a better choice but it was a blitz game and I didn't think this move over for a long time.  Oh well this still worked well enough.
537,18,7,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Now he starts developing some of his pieces.
538,18,8,e5,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/4P3/3P4/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Now I start to set up what I like to call the ""Flying V"".  There's probably a more technical name than that but I like my name for it."
539,18,9,Nd5,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He saves his knight and gives me the chance to truly set up the flying V.
540,18,10,Nc4,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/3nP3/2NP4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',A development move.  Opens up the dark bishop and gets my knight into an attacking position.
541,18,11,g5,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/3nP1p1/2NP4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',No idea why he made this move.  He leaves an unprotected pawn right in my bishop's path and also likely destroys his ability to king-side castle.  This does nothing for development and will most likely end up only hurting him.
542,18,12,f3,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/3nP1p1/2NP4/2P2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"... I should've played 7.Bxg5.  I looked back right after I made this move and facepalmed immediately.  I gave him a free out for his previous bad move.  I'll give myself a ""?"" on this move."
543,18,13,Nf4,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Now the pawn move makes sense even though I should have never let this move happen.
544,18,14,Ne2,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I decided not to let his knight stay comfortable.  I decided to threaten it immediately and try to get it on the move.
545,18,15,Bh6,b'rn1qk2r/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He refuses to move and instead beefs up his defenses.

It freezes his knight in an unprotected position and if he tries to protect it with his queen he'll lose the queen to my bishop.  And as a bonus it sets me up for the queen-side castle.

600,20,1,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2BP4/2b1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is unnecessary until White plays a3 if he does at all and even then Black should consider keeping two bishops for the time being.
601,20,2,exd4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2Bp4/2P1P3/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This pawn exchange is inadvisable as it effectively concedes control of the center to White. Perhaps 6...Nd7 was better.

609,20,10,Kg6,b'rn1Q2nr/p1p2ppp/2q3k1/8/3P4/B3P3/P4PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',The wrong square--Ke6 is probably best--as 14. Nf3 is now a double threat (Nxe5+ and Qg5#). Even if the king went to e6 14. Nf3 Qc3+ 15. Ke2 Qxa3 is bad for Black due to 16. d5+ Kf5 17. Qg5+ Ke4 18. Qe5#
610,20,11,Qf6,b'rn1Q2nr/p1p2ppp/5qk1/8/3P4/B3PN2/P4PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',14...f6 stops both threats. This move technically does as well but still allows the Knight check on e5. 14...f6 also has the benefit of threatening to trap the White Queen with 15...Nd7. Had it been played White's Queen probably has to immediately plot an escape via f8.
611,20,12,Kf5,b'rn1Q2nr/p1p2ppp/5q2/4Nk2/3P4/B3P3/P4PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Again the wrong square for the king. 15...Kh5 (16. g4+ Kh6) was the only move that survives for any length of time.

If there are lessons here I would say: remember the importance of development (ending a game with rooks on their original squares is one thing but Black never even moved a knight) avoid cheap tricks that don't improve your position (such as Black's 7...Qd6) and always have a good reason when exchanging (Black's 5th and 6th moves were more helpful for White than Black).

This is why I don't use the Ruy Lopez.  My dad taught me not to use that defense against e4. I then learned Sicilian and Caro-Kann and Alekhine's instead to deal with e4. I became biased against the Ruy Lopez. I am still biased to this day even though I have used it a couple of times here just to see if it is really as good as others say (and do what) it is. "

The KG was popular at the turn of the Century (20th Century = 1900s) and if you buy a book on Chess Openings that is complete through every 8th move and possibility you will see a quarter of the book dedicated to the King's Gambit. The Gambit is the most diverse and complicated White Attack ever. It is risky and does have holes in it--but by the time you are involved with it the position(s) have sent you light years ahead of any predictable game. I like it that way! No one can memorize the moves even up to the 5th or 6th or 7th--let alone 8th position!

680,22,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',In my opinion the best first move for white. White takes control of the central square d5 and opens the diagonal a4-d1. As we will see in this game 1. c4 ... not necessarily turns into an English Opening.
681,22,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White strengthens the control of the centre.
682,22,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Probably black wants to play 3. ... d5 -  Queens Gambit style. If white wants to avoid this he can play 3. e4 ... . That would be the sharp Mikenas-Carls-attack.
683,22,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq d6',Queens Gambit style as I supposed. Now 4. d4 ... would have turned the game into a real Queens Gambit. But as an English Opening fan I wanted to remain in my prefered structures.
684,22,4,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I think 4. ... exd5 would have been better because this allows white to develop while attacking the black knight.
685,22,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/4P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',As an English Opening fan I prefer the white bishops fianchetto. But now the diagonal a8-h1 is blocked by my own pawn e4. So I decided to take more control of the centre by 7. d4 ... and then to develop the white bishop on the diagonal a6-f1.
686,22,6,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',The best square for the bishop in this case because now the bishop directly aims at the black kings fortress. Very important in this game as we will see.

797,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',King's Pawn game.
798,26,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Apparently called the King's Knight opening but it's still fairly standard.
799,26,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',My standard defense in this situation.
800,26,4,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"I've never really been a fan of this move.  It seems like putting black just for the sake of saying ""check.""  While it may weaken the queen side defenses I like Bc4 instead."
801,26,5,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Protect the King and threaten the bishop.
802,26,6,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Now he's where he should be.
803,26,7,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',In hindsight Be6 was probably a better move.  If he accepts it's a simple BxB trade and if he plays 4...Bd5+ I can follow it with 5.c6 and force his bishop back to d3 or farther.  But I guess this was a fine move.
804,26,8,Ng5,b'rn1qkb1r/pppb1ppp/3p1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',When I saw this move I was kind of confused.  I've seen (and tried) the queen side fork many times but this was the first time I've seen it tried king side.

807,26,11,Qe7,b'rn2kb1r/pppbqNp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I felt like I had to save my queen if I wanted any chance to stay in this game.
808,26,12,Nxh8,b'rn2kb1N/pppbq1p1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq -',There goes the rook.  Now he has a great material advantage and this game could be over fairly quickly.
809,26,13,Nxe4,b'rn2kb1N/pppbq1p1/3p3p/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',I decide to get whatever material that I could get at this point.  It also puts my knight into a pretty good position to attack.
810,26,14,Ng6,b'rn2kb2/pppbq1p1/3p2Np/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq -',Crap another fork.  Really should've seen this coming...
811,26,15,Qf6,b'rn2kb2/pppb2p1/3p1qNp/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Saving my queen a second time.  This time I noticed that his king side was pretty unprotected so I made a play for a quick mate.  If nothing else I would at least get the knight.
812,26,16,Nxf8,b'rn2kN2/pppb2p1/3p1q1p/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq -',I guess that he didn't notice the mate looming.  Now he's got a great material advantage but material isn't everything.
813,26,17,Qxf2#,b'rn2kN2/pppb2p1/3p3p/4p3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1qPP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Mate.  This game is good to show the dangers of focusing too much on one or two pieces.  He was able to rack up a great advantage in material but his defense was non-existent throughout.  I got lucky to win this one and hopefully I won't get myself into this situation again any time soon.

I'd have even chosen the Alekhine's Defense before the French Defense. In fact I don't think I even ever used the French Defense since I knew Sicilian and Caro-Kann before encountering it.  I did study the French Defense open and closed and either way I felt the Sicilian or Caro-Kann or Alekhine's was better.  The Ruy Lopez I never use. I have used it recently just to see if it is as viable as my chosen e4 defenses.  To date I feel the Ruy Lopez is a dead defense.

After founding my new club I ended up playing a few games with my fellow Runners (Experts) one of those was Torsten.  I acquainted him with Operation Joblock - I gave him no opportunities of ingress and even put his queenside under a bit of pressure which was enough to prompt him to hit the Offer Draw button - and to result in an equally prompt acceptance - 4 rating points gladly gained there!  So how did all this happen?  Please read the comment in the annotation."

However I decided to move my pawn to f3 to block up the d1 - h4 diagonal for Torsten's lsb.  Fou Leblanc dissuades his counterpart from controlling the a6-f1 diagonal and the b1-h7 diagonal.  I will see to it that this barbarian will not get through the gate!

Torsten did not like the fact that his queenside pawn structure was gonna get busted and so offered me a draw.  Gameknot Analysis assessed our position as fairly even so it was a good offer and a good acceptance.  This draw game immediately resulted in another one - this time a draw offer from Janet's bro Battlefleet which I gladly accepted and it bumped my rating back north of 1950.

However it is premature and underestimates white's K-side attack. It brings away the black queen who would have been important in the defense.

Perhaps as a teaching lesson it is important to note here that Qf6 brings the black Q into attacking position with a move that at the same time forces white to lose a tempo because black's move ALSO threatens the black rook. There is therefore for example no time to bring the black Q in for rescue!

1199,39,28,6Rh1+,b'8/8/8/8/5k2/8/3N4/4K2r w - -',Aiming for a mate on the first line. 
1200,39,29,Rg2,b'8/8/8/8/5k2/8/3N2r1/4K3 w - -',Okay that didnt't work and I had to concentrate on escaping the threefold repetition.
1201,39,30,Ke3,b'8/8/8/8/8/4k3/3N2r1/3K4 w - -',For a moment the contact between king and knight is interrupted because of black's pressure. But until now this isn't enough for black to win.
1202,39,31,6Nc1,b'8/8/8/8/8/4k3/1r6/2NK4 b - -',The only move that keeps the connection between king and knight and thus keeps white in the game. For example 69. Na1 ... ? is met by 69. ... Rb1+.
1203,39,32,6Rh2,b'8/8/8/8/8/4k3/7r/2NK4 w - -',I was trying to keep the king locked in lying in wait for the critical mistake.
1204,39,33,7Nb3,b'8/8/8/8/8/1N2k3/7r/3K4 b - -',Again the only move. 
1205,39,34,7Kd3,b'8/8/8/8/8/1N1k4/7r/3K4 w - -',Threatening the mate on the first line.
1206,39,35,7Nc5+,b'8/8/8/2N5/8/3k4/7r/3K4 b - -',The critical mistake! Now the white knight is seperated from his king and will fall prey to black sooner or later. Obviously my opponent didn’t knew the aforementioned rule for this endgame. It’s notable that even today strong engines have problems to realize that from now on white is lost. Even after deep calculation they admire 71. Nc5+ ..  71. Nc1+ ... and 71. Ke1 ... as equal. But only 71. Nc1+ ... is drawish while 71. Nc5+ ... ? and also 71. Ke1 ... ? lose. So the consequences of his move must have been beyond my opponents horizon.
1207,39,36,7Na6,b'8/8/N7/8/3k4/8/7r/3K4 b - -',Or 72. Nb3+ Kc3 and then 73. Nc5 Rh4 or 73. Nc1 Rh1+ or 73. Na5 Rh4 and so on. There is no way back for the white knight.
1208,39,37,7Ke1,b'8/2N5/8/4k3/8/8/1r6/4K3 b - -',Or 74. Na8 Kd6 or 74. Ne8 Rb7.
1209,39,38,Rb6,b'8/8/Nr1k4/8/8/8/4K3/8 w - -',As I mentioned there is no way out for the white knight.
1210,39,39,Kxc7,b'8/2k5/1r6/8/8/8/4K3/8 w - -',The rest is silence. That indeed was a lot of hard work folks!
