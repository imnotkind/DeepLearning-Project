Similar to what Ken previously said, you don't just base things on point value.  Unfortunately, that's what I based it on and didn't consider how mobile my Be3.  After thinking about it now, I've concluded that my Be3 was worth more, in this position.  Better was 22.Bd2, or 22.Bc1.  Of those 2 candidate moves, I think that 22.Bd2 since I could use that to recapture, if black were to play ...Rxe1+.

With that being said, I forgot the important lesson that bhidragon emphasized in our rated game with each other when I got my Q out of play by fixating on advancing the c pawn to allow ...Nc6.  As that was little, yet, I spent all of my time focusing on doubling up the R's.  Instead, just like that game, I should've focused on what's coming.  With that being said this loses.  Although it isn't instant, it's still going to cost me the game because we're talking about being the equivalent to a piece down without compensation.

Now, deeper_insight mentioned that this is a known way to draw which I later annotated, in what is the longest game that I have annotated.  Knowing that, I tried the same thing here.  But, I forgot that this causes an intereference which is an important piece being blocked in by your own piece.  My Re8 was protected by my Re1, but this removes the defender.  Consequently, he is going to win more then my R.  And, that goes with what Ken told me which is that, ""one blunder often leads to another.""  "

Knowing how far behind I am, combined with, the fact that it's only going to get worse, I resigned here because there is nothing else to get out of the game.  I think the main lessons to be learned from this game is to be prepared for openings, as well as, to look at everything that's occurring on the board.  Another way of putting it is to study the position which is also noted in a couple of clubs.  It's also not to play Flip Coin Chess at any time which is making a move without giving any thought behind it as that led to the final blunder."

Of course, when I gave the lecture I wasn't alluding to when he first developed the f pawn, but rather, when he advanced it with 17...f4.  So, I said, You played better then you thought. The first mistake was an oversight which lost a pawn. But, where you went wrong was advancing the f pawn. As noted, that kept the structures weak. Surely, I didn't win a pawn immediately, but I initiated an exchange. As then, I could pin your N with my B, with which other things were to come. From that point, I activated my N, with which, I was going to win a piece. That's because I either was going to take one of them right away, or force it to move, with which, I'd get the other piece. From then on, there wasn't much else but some oversights with which I won more material, and had a mate. The important moral to this game is not to advance the f pawn early. That's the weakest pawn on the board. Once that's gone, then you wind up in trouble or have to be very careful as the King starts to become exposed. And, you want to be weary of the N because, even though B's are certainly worth more, once you get a lot of mobility with your Knight, it can become very dangerous, as TA showed in the N visualization count.  And, I showed him the link to that lecture to help for the future."

Where does Black King rest in only 13 moves?How,why?Totally unnecessary and never forced to have Blacks King resting on square h6,which is at a horrible position resting in front of his h7 pawn and what should have been an artificial castled position or a King retreat back to his first rank.Also notice that blacks Rook on h8 never moved and is basically useless.Take additional notes to blacks hemmed in Bishop on f8 compared to my fully open Bishop pair.And finally take note that white had the capability of castling both K side and Q side to expand whites Rook(s) for additional offensive play against blacks King or many of his other pieces.All of this in only 13 moves?????Think about it. 

Sure it is only a blitz game,but trust me,if I look deep enough into this opponents past game record,I will find similar moves that slightly mirror a game like this quick 5 minute game with exchanges that are not well thought out,non existent castling or non existent artificial castling that SHOULD have occurred,but did not,and/or Rooks that should have been moved earlier and were not and hemmed in Bishops(which is a bad trend with many 1900+players) and should have been developed with better pawn chain advancements.So blitz DOES tell a story sometimes(and many times)how an opponent will react in a long corresp game. 

This was a game of psychology.I knew from massive experience that many players WILL place that Bishop in front of their King in blitz expecting me to capture it.And in theory,even exchanges when up my Q booty(or just 3 to 5 piece points),is normally par for the course with moves like...(BxB). 
But the risks outweigh the theory in games like mine.Why?Because that ""theory""is fine if you look around FIRST,BEFORE trying to exchange and see where your King is located and/or where it will be positioned IF I do ""exchange"" Bishops!So following normal channels of even exchange theory when up 5 points or more has flaws in it if you King is not properly placed in a good defensive spot first.And of course,this game proves much of that.

Plus, it is dangerous, as Carl could use that pawn and his R, if I'm not careful.  I thought that his threat would start off with 32.h5+, and after 32...Kg5 while everything seems ok, black might plan something like Rb7-b8-g8 with an overwhelming check.  As those two R's on adjacent files, coupled with that pawn are known to be dangerous as well.  Even without a passed pawn, I could wind up in a lot of trouble.  If that happens, there would be a possiblity of Carl pulling a swindle and winning a lost game.  I was determined not to allow that, and therefore, stop any plans that he might have with his Rb7.  I do this by blocking his h4 pawn, even at the cost of a pawn."
913,38,37,Kg6,b'8/p4R2/2p1rpkp/5b2/P6P/8/KPP4R/4r3 w - -',"And, this is also applicable with what I said above.  I did mention about the other R.  Well he moved it to make that capture which is when I attacked it.  But, I kept that variation in mind which is why 32.Rxf7 was a conditional move as I had planned on Carl doing that to allow this."
914,38,38,h5,b'8/p1R5/2p1rpk1/5b1p/P6P/8/KPP4R/4r3 w - -',"The other idea behind that conditional move is that after he protected his R, I was going to stop Carl's h pawn from advancing any further with his move.  This is ironic but up until here, this is how the game was played.  On the next move, the position starts to become corrupt, so I speculate for a move."
915,38,39,3Rb7,b'8/pR6/2p1rpk1/5b1p/P6P/8/KPP4R/4r3 b - -',"? What I know is that my a pawn was not on the 7th rank.  In fact, I believe that it was on the 6th rank.  I also know that the c2 pawn was attacked, so regardless of what was actually played, Carl's best move was 34.c4 or 34.c4.  By leaving it attacked, I am going to win another pawn."
916,38,40,3Rb6,b'8/p7/1Rp1rpk1/7p/P6P/8/KPb4R/4r3 b - -',"But, this is when the position became too corrupt to continue.  What it looks like is that Carl made a terrible blunder here since I recorded 35...axb6 with a win for black.  It didn't exactly happen this way, but the diagram isn't completely inaccurate.  The only difference is the timing.  That's because Carl blundered the same R in a similar way later in the game.  So, like here, this allowed me to get an additional R for free in the actual game.  When that happened, black resigned because he was too far behind to continue.  The only difference is here that I made it occur earlier then how it happened in the game because the position became too corrupt to annotate any further, at this point. "
