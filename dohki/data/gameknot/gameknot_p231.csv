0,0,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"Hi everyone!

Have you ever been in a dodgy position against a lower rated player and considered trying to buy your way out of it with a draw offer in order to concede a few points to avoid the loss of many?  I certainly did in this game but guess what my gut instinct kicked in and told me to hang fire.  I'm glad I listened to it because my opponent timed out!  Anyhow on with the action white kicks off with 1. Nf3 the Reti Opening."
1,0,1,Bg2,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4. Bg2 - the kingside is fairly symmetrical here.

9,0,9,Bg4,b'r3n3/ppq1r1kp/2pp1pp1/4n3/4P1b1/1PQ2NP1/P1P1NPBP/3R1RK1 w - -',17. ........ Bg4 - development.

15,0,15,f5,b'7k/p1q1r1np/1ppp2p1/4rp2/1PP1PN2/5QPP/P2R1P2/4R1K1 w - -',27. ........ f5 - this move triggers an exchange of pawns.

If I continue to trade on the e file I will end up with a very passive Q + Kt v Q + Kt ending.  After I played this move I worked out an interesting sequence.  This sequence was not played because it was here that black timed out.  It goes like this:-

30. Rxe5 dxe5 
31. Rxe5 Qxe5 
32. Nxg6+ hxg6 
33. Qxf7 Qe1+ 
34. Kh2 Qxb4 
35. Qxa7 Qxc4 
36. Qxb6 Qxa2 
37. Qxc6 Qb1 

I would prefer to be white in that final position and I would have probably have negotiated a low draw there.  Which colour would you the jury prefer to be?  I will leave it to you."

25,2,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Nc6 is the probably most played move in this position to protect the key e5 pawn.
26,2,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Many possible variations from here. I hoped for the boring Nf6 so i could use my favourite Fried Liver Attack but it turns out to be...
27,2,2,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Giuoco Piano! Also known as the Italian Game. White logically places his Bishop on an active diagonal and eyes the vulnerable pawn on f7. This opening was very popular in the 1800s but better defensive techniques and the advent of the more subtle Ruy Lopez took away some of its luster.
28,2,3,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4.c3 leads to the main line. White takes control of the d4 square and prepares to grab the center with a d2-d4 advance. Black has to take active measures against this; indecisive play will allow White to carry out his plan with all spatial gains and perks that go along with a successful annexation of the center. Have you noticed the difference between me and armita's rating? it's about 600!!!
29,2,4,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -', Best play is 4...Nf6 striking at White's e-pawn.

33,2,8,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpp1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - d6',Black takes the initiative with an aggressive d5.
34,2,9,exd5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bPp1N1/2B5/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',White takes d5.
35,2,10,Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bPp1N1/2B3b1/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',I think this is called a zwischenzug. German for an in-between move. White gets his bishop involved with an aggressive Bg4 targeting my queen. :'(
36,2,11,Qc2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bPp1N1/2B3b1/2P5/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',I moved my queen to c2 targeting the vulnerable h7.
37,2,12,Na5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/n1bPp1N1/2B3b1/2P5/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Black escapes the en prise by moving the Knight to a5 targeting the unprotected Bishop on c4.
38,2,13,Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/n1bPp1N1/6b1/2PB4/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Bishop moves to d3 looking to attack h7 that pawn might not live long you know.

40,2,15,1Nh7,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppN/5n1p/n1bPp3/6b1/2PB4/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Targeting that rook on f8. My chess teacher told me to think that your opponent will do the best possible move so i thought 10 Bh7+ Kh8 then nothing really happens. But 10 Bh7+ Nxh7?? 11 Qxh7#.
41,2,16,1Bxh7+,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppB/7p/n1bPp3/6b1/2P5/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - -',An exchange of Knights. To be honest i can't believe i'm a pawn up!

Qxe6 which lets white play 19. Qc5 exploiting the hole in black's defense pinning the king in the center and forcing black to spend energy evicting the white queen.
61,3,9,1Nd4,b'3rk2r/2p1q1pp/p1n1p1b1/1p1pP3/3N4/2P1Q3/PP1N1PPP/R3R1K1 b k -',Attacking that backward pawn early though not with enough material to win it yet.

It retreats the knight away from the action and posts it on a square where it won't do black any good. 19. ... Nxd4 might have been better eliminating the threat to the backward pawn at e6. And with 20. Qh3 white is now getting more serious in his attack against e6. As a side note this game will end in 22 moves and this knight will still be on b8 though it does get a chance to make a last-move sacrifice that merely delays checkmate by one move.
63,3,11,2b4,b'1n1rk2r/2p1qbpp/p3p3/1p1pP3/1P1N4/2P4Q/P2N1PPP/R3R1K1 b k b3',21. b4 serves two purposes. First it limits the mobility of black's queen though she's pretty much tied to defense anyway. More importantly it defends c5 robbing black of the square and preparing to post a knight there.

Black may have been better off consolidating with 25. ... Bg8 which defends h7 and g7 and opens the f-file for the black rook.

It's kind of like bringing the goalie out of the goal box - it adds one more piece to black's arsenal. Still his pieces are in each others' way and he's probably feeling a little cramped. White should be able to exploit that.

White has been pressuring that backward pawn on e6 since he created it with the exchange 14 moves ago. However white lost one of the attackers when he moved his queen away from h3 and the pawn is fully protected. But I noticed that on e6 the white knight forks the black queen and rook so I decided to analyze this crazy move to see if it could be justified. First thing 32. ... Bxe6 33. Nxe6 Rxe6 looks bad for white since he loses a piece for a pawn. But then there is always 34. (or even 33.) Rg7+! Kxg7 35. Qxg5+ and white gains material. But what about 32. ... Rxe6? 33. Nxe6 Bxe6 35. Rg7 and again white wins the black queen and as an added bonus breaks even on two knights for rook and pawn. Suddenly this move didn't look so crazy. Black can reply 32. ... Qxe3 exchanging queens and avoiding losing material. Except white has a zwischenzug that invalidates that line. So finally the queen can run away say with 32. ... Qf5 but then white simply wins material with 33. Nxf8. Much goodness no badness. And I almost didn't even look at the move...

72,3,20,3Rf1,b'1n3r2/R4b2/2p3k1/1pN1P2p/1P1p2p1/2P1P3/6PP/5RK1 b - -',The first thing black did was offer white the chance to undouble those e-pawns with 35. exd4 creating 4 solid linked pawns. But white has better attacks to make; that pawn capture can wait.
73,3,21,3Rf6+,b'1n3r2/R4b2/2p2Rk1/1pN1P2p/1P4p1/2p1P3/6PP/6K1 b - -',Or maybe it can't wait since black opted for a preemptive strike. But it will prove to be black's undoing.

75,3,23,3Rf1,b'1n3Nk1/R4b2/2p5/1p2P2p/1P4p1/4P3/2p3PP/5RK1 b - -',Oho it's going to be like that is it? Well can't let him have his queen that won't do.
76,3,24,4Nh7,b'1n4k1/R6N/2p5/1p2P2p/1Pb3p1/4P3/2p3PP/5RK1 b - -',OK enough is enough. Black wants the rook he's welcome to it. White only needs the knight and one rook (and a little help from a pawn) to checkmate black. This move doesn't force the checkmate but it is a forced checkmate if black captures with 40. ... Bxf1. See it? You can also find it as a puzzle I created from this position number 10429.
77,3,25,4Nf6+,b'1n4k1/R7/2p2N2/1p2P2p/1P4p1/4P3/2p3PP/5bK1 b - -',Oops black took the rook checkmate is forced though really the outcome was already eseentially decided.
78,3,26,4e6,b'1n3k2/R7/2p1PN2/1p5p/1P4p1/4P3/2p3PP/5bK1 b - -',So many choices for black including promoting his pawn but nothing will stop 43. Rf7# except the knight sacrifice which only delays the checkmate by one move - as predicted back on move 20.
79,4,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black clumsily attempts to transpose to the Orthodox Sicilian having no experience with the Sicilian Center Game. cxd4 is obviously the better move.
80,4,1,e5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2P1p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black seeks to avoid 3. .. e6 4. Nf3 Bxc5 e5 which could inhibit his development and prepares to recoup the pawn.  Black rejected 3. .. Qa5+ 4. .. Qxc5 as too risky.  Didn't notice 3. .. e6 4. Nf3 d6 but that doesn't seem superior.
81,4,2,Bxc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black recoups the pawn immediately to open a chance for a queenside fianchetto.
82,4,3,Bc4,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White threatens f7 two moves away from checking or forking the Queen and Rook.
83,4,4,Qa5+,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/q1b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black interrupts with a check hoping to lure White into a trap:  6. .. Bxf2!? 7. Kxf2? Qc5+ 8. .. Qxc4 preventing castling and gaining a pawn.  If White doesn't capture Black's position is more tenuous.
84,4,5,Bd2,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/q1b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',I think c3 -might- be better.  Not sure.
85,4,6,Bxf2+,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/q3p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPB1bPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Black prevents castling and gains a pawn though if White doesn't capture Black's situation gets more complicated.
86,4,7,Be3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2q1p3/2B1P3/4BN2/PPP2KPP/RN1Q3R b kq -',White's best move.  Other options sacrifice more pieces block the h1 Rook or lose another tempo.
87,4,8,Qxc4,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/2q1P3/4BN2/PPP2KPP/RN1Q3R w kq -',Black completes the exchange.
88,4,9,Na3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/2q1P3/N3BN2/PPP2KPP/R2Q3R b kq -',White develops the Knight to dislodge Black's queen.
89,4,10,Qa6,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/q1n5/4p3/4P3/N3BN2/PPP2KPP/R2Q3R w kq -',Black believed all other squares give White more chances to gain time through additional attacks on the queen.
90,4,11,1Qd5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/q1n5/3Qp3/4P3/N3BN2/PPP2KPP/R6R b kq -',"I didn't see what White gained from this.  The rooks can form up on the d-file but he loses a tempo having to move his queen.  I believed it might be a clever trap because the Nf6 response is so obvious that I thought he wouldn't move it there without a purpose.  Maybe he miscalculated the c7 fork attempt exchange?

As it turns out it was clearly a mistake."
91,4,12,1Nf6,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/q1n2n2/3Qp3/4P3/N3BN2/PPP2KPP/R6R w kq -',The obvious reply.
92,4,13,1Qd3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/q1n2n2/4p3/4P3/N2QBN2/PPP2KPP/R6R b kq -',White's Queen retreats and offers an exchange.
93,4,14,1Qxd3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/N2qBN2/PPP2KPP/R6R w kq -',Accepted.  Black didn't see a way to save his queen without getting into a very bad position.
94,4,15,Ng4+,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P1n1/N2PBN2/PP3KPP/R6R w kq -',With the tempo granted by White's Qd5 Black forks White's King and Bishop hoping to weaken White's control of the center.
95,4,16,1Kxe3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/N2PKN2/PP4PP/R6R b kq -',White's position though seemingly exposed is a lot stronger than Black anticipated.
96,4,17,1a6,b'r1b1k2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4P3/N2PKN2/PP4PP/R6R w kq -',A mistake.  Black attempts to prevent White advancing towards a Nc7 fork.  Avoiding it would require castling immediately and then moving the a8 rook to a useless position while White's knight would securely prevent Re8.  Black seeks to avoid all of that.
97,4,18,1Nc4,b'r1b1k2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n5/4p3/2N1P3/3PKN2/PP4PP/R6R b kq -',15. Nc4!  White threatens a Nb6 fork of the Rook and Bishop -and- a Nd6 fork between the King and Bishop which would cost Black the ability to castle.  I saw only these two possibilities but White soon demonstrated a third.
98,4,19,1Nfxe5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1p1ppp/p1n5/4N3/2N1P3/3PK3/PP4PP/R6R b - -',White catches Black completely flat-footed regaining parity while maintaining the threat to the Rook and Bishop.  I begin to suspect I will lose or at best force a draw but there is still hope.
99,4,20,1Nxe5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1p1ppp/p7/4n3/2N1P3/3PK3/PP4PP/R6R w - -',After looking at various exchanges Black captures on e5 believing that whether White forks or exchanges Knights he can at least maintain material equality.  I was also hoping for an opportunity to draw aside White's defending pawns: I hadn't expected exchanging queens on d3 to leave White's King protected in the center this way.
100,4,21,b5,b'r1b2rk1/3p1ppp/p7/1p2N3/4P3/3PK3/PP4PP/R6R w - b6',Preventing the Knight from returning to c4 to threaten a fork of a8 and c8 again.
101,4,22,1Rhf1,b'r1b2rk1/3p1ppp/p7/1p2N3/4P3/3PK3/PP4PP/R4R2 b - -',White takes advantage of the half-open f-file to double the pressure on f7.  Black's f8 rook is effectively pinned to the pawn's defense.
102,4,23,1f6,b'r1b2rk1/3p2pp/p4p2/1p2N3/4P3/3PK3/PP4PP/R4R2 w - -',Dislodging White's Knight from the center of the board.
103,4,24,d5,b'r1b2rk1/6pp/p4p2/1p1p4/4P3/3PKN2/PP4PP/R4R2 w - d6',Chosen over 19. .. Bb7 because Black wants to pull the e-pawn off not capture on e4.
104,4,25,Bb7,b'r4rk1/1b4pp/p4p2/1p1P4/8/3PKN2/PP4PP/R4R2 w - -',Black's Queen Bishop finally develops.
105,4,26,2Kd4,b'r4rk1/1b4pp/p4p2/1p1P4/3K4/3P1N2/PP4PP/R4R2 b - -',"Completely surprised me.  I was almost certain White would take advantage of the moves needed to recapture on d5 to put himself in a ""false castle"" on g1 or at least retreat to behind the d3 pawn. I thought that with the fortified center gone White's king was vulnerable and on the run."
106,4,27,Bxd5,b'3r1rk1/6pp/p4p2/1p1b4/8/2KP1N2/PP4PP/R4R2 w - -',Recapturing with the rook seemed risky.
107,4,28,2b3,b'3r1rk1/6pp/p4p2/1p1b4/8/1PKP1N2/P5PP/R4R2 b - -',I realized two things: 1) White's king's presence prevented a queen-side pawn advance without considerable support from the pieces I wanted exerting control over the center.  2) White's pieces were better disposed to support a race to promotion especially the d3 pawn.
108,4,29,2g5,b'3r1rk1/7p/p4p2/1p1b2p1/8/1PKP1N2/P5PP/R4R2 w - g6',It was necessary to preempt exchanges opening up White's a1 Rook and advancing the queenside pawns or Black would lose the initiative.  g5 closed off another Kingside square to White's Knight.  After the multiple fork threats on the queenside I was shy of opening up another opportunity for a Knight run amok.
109,4,30,2Kb4,b'3r1rk1/7p/p4p2/1p1b2p1/1K6/1P1P1N2/P5PP/R4R2 b - -',White demonstrates that unsupported Black pawns can make an effective barrier.  I thought the goal was to support a pawn breakthrough.
110,4,31,2g4,b'3r1rk1/7p/p4p2/1p1b4/1K4p1/1P1P1N2/P5PP/R4R2 w - -',Black believed a strong threat was necessary to prevent his Queen-side pawns from falling.
111,4,32,2Nh4,b'3r1rk1/7p/p4p2/1p1b4/1K4pN/1P1P4/P5PP/R4R2 b - -',Probably the the best square.  Nd4 would have led to Bxg2.  Saving the Rook would lead to Rxd4+ allowing the Bishop to escape and yielding Black a pawn-minor piece advantage.  I was hoping for that but no such luck.
112,4,33,2Kg7,b'3r1r2/6kp/p4p2/1p1b4/1K4pN/1P1P4/P5PP/R4R2 w - -',At the time this Long March made sense to me.  I thought White would take advantage of the White King's vulnerability to offer check at each step of the way being forced to withdraw by its (hopefully surprising) continuing advance.  Instead White took control of the e-file defended the knight and raised the possibility of its rooks doubling.  I don't know -why- I stuck with it except that stopping the advance would give White a check in hand ready to use whenever needed.
113,4,34,2g3,b'3r1r2/7p/p4p2/1p1b2k1/1K4pN/1P1P2P1/P4R1P/4R3 b - -',I had still hoped for the attractive-looking blunder 28. Rf5.
114,4,35,2f5,b'3r1r2/7p/p7/1p1b1pk1/1K4pN/1P1P2P1/P4R1P/4R3 w - -',I saw 29. Rf5+ looming forcing Kh6.
115,4,36,2Re5,b'3r1r2/7p/p7/1p1bRpk1/1K4pN/1P1P2P1/P4R1P/8 b - -',I did _not_ see this. This threat to remove my pawn cover would involve seriously damaging exchanges but running would cause serious problems too.
116,4,37,2Bf3,b'3r1r2/7p/p7/1p2Rpk1/1K4pN/1P1P1bP1/P4R1P/8 w - -',I couldn't see any way to avoid losing pieces so I tried to maintain parity.  The f5 pawn would remain and the knight would be gone.  I felt that losing only a pawn in preventing what I thought could lead to a mating attack wasn't so bad.
117,4,38,Rf6,b'3r4/7p/p4r2/1p2Rpk1/1K6/1P1P1RP1/P6P/8 w - -',"Makes doubled-rook defense of f5 possible.  Once the King has moved it also brings a doubled-rook threat to d3 into play.  31. .. Rd4+ seemed merely to give White the opportunity for Ka5 requiring the a6 pawn to be constantly guarded and factored into any exchange at f5.

31. .. Kg4 may be superior."
118,4,39,3h3,b'3r4/7p/p4r2/1p2Rpk1/1K6/1P1P1RPP/P7/8 b - -',White seals off Kg4 and raises the threat of g4 gaining another pawn.
119,4,40,3Kg6,b'3r4/7p/p4rk1/1p2Rp2/1K6/1P1P1RPP/P7/8 w - -',Black retreats to release the pin on the f5-pawn without blocking the h-pawn.
120,4,41,3a4,b'3r4/7p/p4rk1/1p2Rp2/PK6/1P1P1RPP/8/8 b - a3',The queenside attack begins but delicately: White seeks an open avenue for the b-pawn without exposing the King to check.  For now that means getting to the a-file and leaving the a6 pawn unmolested.
121,4,42,h5,b'3r4/8/p4rk1/4Rp1p/K7/1P1P1RPP/8/8 w - h6',Black doesn't want 35. g4 to draw off the f5 pawn or to face the possibility of the h-pawn advancing possibly under the protection of a withdrawn Rook from e5.
122,4,43,Rd4+,b'8/8/p4rk1/4Rp1p/K2r3P/1P1P1RP1/8/8 w - -',I wanted to force an exchange somehow.  My position seemed too tenuous while I could emerge from a good exchange at a roughly equal position but with fewer balls in the air.  I also hoped to be able to use my King more aggressively if the position opened up more.
123,4,44,f4,b'8/8/p4rk1/4R2p/KP1r1p1P/3P1RP1/8/8 w - -',I wasn't sure White would go for it.  I thought that 37. Rg5+ would precede the actual exchange leaving me in a worse position but even that seemed preferable to the lockdown around f5.
124,4,45,3Re4,b'8/8/p5k1/7p/KP2Rr1P/3P4/8/8 b - -',White seeks a further Rook exchange.  After 39. .. Rxe4 40. dxe4 Black's king couldn't advance to remove the h4 pawn via f5 since the d4 pawn would be guarding it.  Black would thus have no hope of making it in time to prevent a White promotion on the b-file even if the King bagged two pawns.
125,4,46,3Rf6,b'8/8/p4rk1/7p/KP2R2P/3P4/8/8 w - -',Black returns to defending a3.
126,4,47,4Kb3,b'8/8/p4rk1/7p/1P2R2P/1K1P4/8/8 b - -',I thought White intended to support both the d-pawn and the Rook's advance with his King but given his later moves I'm no longer certain what White's plans were.
127,4,48,4Kf5,b'8/8/p4r2/5k1p/1P2R2P/1K1P4/8/8 w - -',Black moves to a position threatening White's Rook.  From this position the d3 pawn cannot advance without losing the Rook.  It would take the White King's support to push forward.
128,4,49,4Kc4,b'8/8/p4r2/5k1p/1PK1R2P/3P4/8/8 b - -',Still advancing.  From e3 the King could protect the Rook while the pawn moves to d4.
129,4,50,4Rg6,b'8/8/p5r1/5k1p/1PK1R2P/3P4/8/8 w - -',The Rook pivots around the King.  Still defending a6 it now also threatens  42. .. Rg4.
130,4,51,4Kb3,b'8/8/p5r1/5k1p/1P2R2P/1K1P4/8/8 b - -',White's King can't support the Rook without leaving the b-pawn vulnerable.  Perhaps that is why the King retreated?
131,4,52,4Rg4,b'8/8/p7/5k1p/1P2R1rP/1K1P4/8/8 w - -',This seemed silly to me on the face of it: rooks exchange White has three pawns left and Black's King can't stop them all.  In a way it's the mirror-image of the exchange White offered with 39. Re4.  White would still come out winning in terms of body-count.  The difference: Black's pawn advances beyond capturing with an exchange on g4.  If White refuses the exchange Black can move to threaten the pawn at d3 and thus White's Rook.
132,4,53,4Rxg4,b'8/8/p7/5k1p/1P4RP/1K1P4/8/8 b - -',Taking the exchange.  White had just offered one after all.
133,4,54,4hxg4,b'8/8/p7/5k2/1P4pP/1K1P4/8/8 w - -',"Black's pawn can beat any White pawn in the race to promotion and will outpace any effort by White's King to capture immediately following promotion.  The only pawn that can ""tie"" is h4 but Black has time to intercept with the King without risking the g-pawn advance.  Barring astronomical errors Black wins."
134,4,55,g3,b'8/8/p7/5k2/1P1P3P/1K4p1/8/8 w - -',"White recognizes that the race is lost and resigns.

Many mistakes were made.  Preventing the King from castling strengthened White's center.  Black was forced to make exchanges that weakened his relative position to hold out this long.  In the end it was a mistake that allowed Black to win.  With perfect play by both sides I believe this would have been a draw but as you can see there is no perfect play in this game.  I hope it is an instructional low-rating match."
135,5,0,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',b4 is considered as one of the 'weird openings' and so swindon has played it. It has a few names such as the Polish Sokolsky and the Orangutan. The name 'orangutan' comes from Polish GM Saviely Tartakower (you must have heard of him) and he was trying to think of a queenside thrust while at the zoo and he saw an Orangutan...
136,5,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black (me) has lots of playable answers but the most promising is the obvious and logical 1...e5 grabbing the center and creating an immediate threat against b4 from the f8 bishop which suddenly gets involved.
137,5,2,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',This was always the original plan for white grabbing queenside space and fianchettoing his Bishop on the long b2-h8 diagonal. On the negative side the b4 is hanging dry and ready to get killed as it is undefended.
138,5,3,Bxe5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Black has given up the important central e-pawn for the white b-pawn. This exchange makes white happy since now he owns a central majority of pawns.
139,5,4,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black has a nice lead in development and blocks his weak g7 pawn. Note now the black Queen is protecting the knight.
140,5,5,g4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq g3',(?!) Dubious move as white is trying to launch a kingside attack on black. This however completely weakens White's kingside defense. White also would like the knight to take g4 so he can pick off g7 a key square for the King's defense.
141,5,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4B3/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Simple developing move and adding pressure to the Bishop on e5. Black is a lot further ahead on developing his minor pieces.
142,5,7,Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2B2/8/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',(?) Bishop is on a lovely diagonal - why lose it?
143,5,8,Qxf6,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',White exchanges his good well-developed Bishop for a not as well developed Knight.
144,5,9,c3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/1b4P1/2P5/P2PPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',White escapes the big threat on the rook on a1 and causing pressure to the bishop on b4.
145,5,10,Bc5,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/6P1/2P5/P2PPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Bishop retreats to c5 and an obvious checkmate is on f2. It is basically a reversed Scholar's mate. I had a good plan here though. If white played 7.d4 adding pressure to the bishop and central squares control 7...Nxd4! 8.cxd4 Bxd4 the white rook is trapped and lost. 
146,5,11,Bg2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/6P1/2P5/P2PPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Bg2 (??) obvious checkmate and he must be embarrassed to have missed it.

Here I played against Chris who is our Gameknot Youtube Annotator.  We ended up playing the Four Knight's Opening.  With the popularity of the Sicilian and the Ruy Lopez this opening is not so widely played although a year ago Coach Ion played the Belgrade Gambit against me in a game I have still not been able to bring myself to annotate.  That is because in my bid to exchange down to an equal ending I made a very stupid blunder walked Fou Leblanc into a pin and Ion took full advantage of this.  One day I may annotate it under the Blunderfest Series but not now.  I do however have a link to that game it is:- http://gameknot.com/list-games.pl?mode=h&u=jstevens1&opp=ionadowman.

14. Nc3 developing and making him harder to push e5. With Nf5 he allows his bishop to d6 thus exchanging it with mine. And the only way I have to stop it is BxN but this is ugly even if he gets a doubled pawn (not easy to take advantage of it). "

So I went for a surprising one: "

30. Na4 and the black King cannot go closer to the pawn and if the rook takes the pawn 
30. ... Rxa6 
31. Nf5+ wins a neat quality.

32.	e4xd5 e6xd5
33.	Rb1+	Ka7 (assuming black's plan is to take the a pawn)
34.	Ra1 Kb6 (it looks as if he will achieve it)
35.	Ka4+ and if Kxa6
36.	Kc5+ Kb6 and the rook is lost again!

Maybe this will never happen in the game but I couldn't resist the temptation to find out if he would have seen the trap or not. The alternative was 
29. Nf4 retaining his king to this side of the board with the result to somewhat stall the game or if he changes his bishop for my knight his king comes first and takes my pawn so no good. "

The opening is named after the French player Marcel Desprez. Like a number of other rare openings 1.h4 has some alternate names such as ""Kadas Opening"" ""Anti-Borg Opening"" ""Samurai Opening"" and ""Reagan's Attack"". Gabor Kadas is a Hungarian player. According to Eric Schiller's Unorthodox Chess Openings the latter name is because 1.h4 is ""thoroughly unmotivated and creates weaknesses with only vague promises of future potential"" a political gibe against Ronald Reagan.

Like 1.a4 the Ware Opening 1.h4 is an irrelevant pawn move which does nothing in the fight over central space and does very little for development. The only piece released is the rook and this piece is usually not developed by moving it to h3. In addition 1.h4 weakens White's kingside. For all of these reasons 1.h4 is among the rarest of the twenty possible first moves for White.

Just in-case you wanted to know here are some other names for the h4 opening:
Kadas Opening Anti-Borg Opening Samurai Opening and Reagan's Attack

There are five named variations in the Desprez Opening:

The Koola-Koola continues 1...a5. 
The Wulumulu continues 1...e5 2. d4 
The Crab Variation continues 1...any 2. a4. 
The Borg Gambit continues 1...g5. 
The Symmetric Variation continues 1...h5. 

N.B. I am not lying about any of these!

Grandmaster David Bronstein once remarked that he knew of a Russian player who always opened 1.h4 and always won. His point was that after 1. ...e5 2.g3 d5 3.d4! exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Qd1 Nf6 6.Nh3! Be7 7.Nf4 0-0 8.Bg2 the f4 knight is well placed and White has a good position. However Black does not have to be so cooperative.

As the Desprez Opening is very rare it is considered an irregular opening so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.

The advantage of playing Be4 first is that after he plays f3 he won't be able to put his bishop there. If I play Bg3 immediately I think his best move is Bf3 to try and get rid of my knight. And I need it there at least one more move.
595,23,16,Nc3,b'r3k2r/3q1p2/2pbppp1/8/1pPP4/pPn1BPP1/P2QB2P/2KR3R w kq -',But now I've build a nice spot for my invader and getting him out isn't so easy.

Then I'll either have to have a new safe square for the knight or I'll have to trade for his bishop. But what I gain is more initiative. He has to deal with chasing away the knight and while he has to move his pieces to worse spots to do that I can be moving mine to better.
597,23,18,2Bd3,b'r3k2r/3q1p2/2pb1pp1/4p3/1pPP4/pPnBBPP1/P2Q3P/2K1R2R b kq -',He prevents me from playing e4.

604,24,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Usually the response is Nc6. But swindon went for the Petroff Defense. Otherwise known as the 'Russian Game'. Black is simply trying to keep things equal and nullify the advantage of White's first move and achieve simple equality.
605,24,1,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Usually the best move for black here was d6. Nxe4(?!) as the old trap here is possible.
606,24,2,Qe2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Qe2 is the normal response to Nxe4 hoping that black is silly enough to do 4...Nf3 5.Nc6!! when  white wins black's queen due to the discovered check from the queen.
607,24,3,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Qe7(!?) black trying to keep the game as symmetrical as possible. I find that in general the Petroff Defense is played by those who don't mind drawing as black. If you are in a must-win situation this opening would not be a good choice. Just in-case you wanted to know so far is the position American Champion Frank Marshall had who liked to play for the win as black. However if white plays d3 white has what few chances there are. 
608,24,4,Qxe4,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/8/4N3/4Q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Qxe4 (!?) Well i thought i should might as well take the knight so i'm a whole piece up so early in the game. Only downside of this is that the knight is pinned due to the black queen.
609,24,5,d6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/4N3/4Q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Obviously trying to get rid of the knight which becomes en prise from the pawn.
610,24,6,d4,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/4N3/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq d3',d4 just keeps the knight feeling a bit safer and gains more control in the center of the board.
611,24,7,dxe5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/4P3/4Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Exchange helps white to win a piece back though still a pawn down with no central pawns.
612,24,8,Qb4+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1q2Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Qb4+ is there really any point to exchange queens off right now? I don't think so.
613,24,9,Bxb4+,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1b6/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',I exchanged queens off as i am a pawn up and i was forced to or i would have lost my queen.
614,24,10,Bc5,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/8/8/PPPB1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Black retreats his bishop to c5 to try an attack on f2.
615,24,11,1f4,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/5P2/8/PPPB2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq f3',I feel this is the obvious move  getting rid of the threat and beefing up the e5 pawn. White has complete control in the center.
616,24,12,1Bd4,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3b1P2/8/PPPB2PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',Black bishop attempts an attack on b2 which is very easy to spot.
617,24,13,1Nc3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3b1P2/2N5/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Bd4 just helps white really with Nc3 helping white to develop. White has now 4 pieces out on the board (Nc3Bd2e5f4) while Black has only his bishop on d4. However i think the b6-g1 diagonal is quite a nice one for it.
618,24,14,1Bxc3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2b5/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Bxc3? Why get rid of your only active piece which is in a nice position for a not-as-well-placed knight? Black has just got rid of his ONLY active piece! 
619,24,15,1Bxc3,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',The exchange puts me into a brilliant position.

You might have heard that opposite side castling has an aggressive game to come.  Find out more about opposite side castling in 'The Art of Attack' by Keres and Kotov (a classic little book).  That book gives a fine discussion of opposite castling.
622,24,18,1Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - -',Black begins to get his pieces involved...

625,24,21,1Rd7,b'r4rk1/pppR1ppp/2n5/4P3/2B2Pb1/2B5/PPP3PP/2K4R b - -',Now i've placed my rook on the 7th row which is quite a dangerous area.
626,24,22,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pppR1ppp/2n5/4P3/2B2Pb1/2B5/PPP3PP/2K4R w - -',I just realised that Rd7 was a blunder as Bxd7. Fortunately swindon missed this.

All this time I keep looking at playing Bxa3 too. My bishop's pinned so it can't do anything on the kingside and trading would push his knight to the side. But I haven't done it for a couple of reasons. Mainly he can't develop the knight while his bishop is still on a3. Also if he decides to capture me I get my queen off the back row. I don't want to use one move to take his bishop and another move to bring my queen off the back row (especially since I haven't decided for sure yet where I want to put her)."
681,26,8,Bd6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp3pp/2nbb3/3p1p2/3Pn3/BP2PNP1/P4PBP/RNQ2RK1 w - -',I feel like I'm just tempting him to take my bishop -- but now if he takes it I'll either get to put my queen on d6 which I like or I might even like to take back with the pawn (expecting to play dxe4 some day when he trades off my knight) and putting my rook on the same file as his queen.

I still remember a tournament I played in back in the 80s. Every game reached a similar position and they were all kind of dull; I think I went 2-3 in that tournament. I remember thinking that if I wanted to excel in chess I should study and become an expert in that position and drive all of my games to that position.  And I knew if I did that I'd get bored with chess and not be playing after a few years. My decision after that tournament was to try to avoid playing boring chess -- when I have a choice between a safe and an interesting move I want to play the interesting move. And chess has always been fun for me using that philosophy!

This bishop usually adopts a more attacking posture on c4 or prepares to occupy the long diagonal with B-e2-f3.  On d3 it's blocked in by the pawn on e4 and not actually attacking anything.

So why did I use the bishop? I got tired of dealing with the pin. And I was wondering how I could get some initiative if I used the knight. 
  - My queen would still need to stay on e2 or f1 to guard the pawn on f2.
  - If the queen's on e2 then the knight's still pinned.
  - My queen and rook are guarding another pawn on e4.
  - I can't play Be3 to block his threats without losing the pawn on e4 (and opening up difficulties with Qxb2).
So I decided to use the bishop. I wondered if he would play Bxh3. I'll play g4 and end up trading two pawns for the bishop but my king would be wide open. Fortunately his queen's on the other side of the board."

It protects e5 and the pawn on b2 and attacks the queen but after Qb4 attacks the knight and rook I've got to play Qc3 and a trade would give me real bad pawns. So I decided to let him have e5 and instead protect my b-pawn a different way and maybe trade off that bishop that's giving me problems.

764,29,8,1Rd1,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/2b1n3/4P3/1N4PP/PPP1QP2/R1BR2K1 b - -',I thought hard about taking that bishop. When you're under attack you want to trade off pieces. But I decided it was more important to grab the open file. Also now my rook can't get caught in a fork on f3.
765,29,9,1Bf4,b'r2r2k1/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/2b1n3/4PB2/1N4PP/PPP1QP2/R2R2K1 b - -',No way will I just trade and let him control the d-file. With my knight blocking his queen I can get my bishop out and get his knight off of that good square.
766,29,10,1Ng6,b'r2r2k1/pp3ppp/1qp1p1n1/2b5/4PB2/1N4PP/PPP1QP2/R2R2K1 w - -',I'd prefer to hold on to a bishop.
767,29,11,Be7,b'r2r2k1/pp2bppp/1qp1p1n1/6B1/4P3/1N4PP/PPP1QP2/R2R2K1 w - -',I joked that he got impatient waiting for me to take his bishop with my knight so he finally moved away. Now I'm feeling better; his last two moves have been retreats and I know how to make it three in a row.

I just taught my students last night that you want to move the unopposed pawn to create a breakthrough. In this case I figured that he couldn't afford to let it become a passed pawn."
772,29,16,2Ra6,b'1r4k1/4bppp/RBp1p1n1/8/4P3/1N4PP/1PP2P2/6K1 b - -',I like that. I guards the bishop of course. It also will let my knight move without risking Rxb2. And when the bishop moves I'll have a discovered attack on his pawn with the rook (if my knight isn't able to take it first).
773,29,17,2Be3,b'2r3k1/4bpp1/R1p1p1n1/N6p/4P3/4B1PP/1PP2P2/6K1 b - -',I also thought of moving it to d4 to keep his knight from coming to e5. But that would've given him a free move by attacking the bishop with a pawn and I'd have to move it to e3 anyway.

776,29,20,3Ng6,b'2r3k1/4bpp1/R1p1p1n1/N6p/4PP2/4B1PP/1PP5/6K1 w - -',He doesn't have a good place for that knight. After Nf3+ I can trap it after Kf2. But it's going to be several moves before that knight's a factor again.
777,29,21,3Nxc6,b'2r3k1/4bpp1/R1N1p1n1/7p/4PP2/4B1PP/1PP5/6K1 b - -',I thought about trading with the rook but I was worried that he would play Ra8 and get my open file. What I like about this is his rook can't go to a8 b8 c8 or d8 -- and he can't chase away my knight with his bishop!
778,29,22,3e5,b'2r3k1/4b1p1/R1N1p1n1/4Pp1p/5P2/4B1PP/1PP5/6K1 b - -',I don't want to open up any new lines that he might be able to use.
779,29,23,3h4,b'2r3k1/4b1p1/R1N1p1n1/4Pp2/5P1p/4B1PP/1PP5/6K1 w - -',That's a challenging move. 
780,29,24,3g4,b'2r3k1/4b1p1/R1N1p1n1/4Pp2/5PPp/4B2P/1PP5/6K1 b - -',I knew that I didn't want to take the pawn. I end up with an isolated rook's pawn on the same side of the board as his king so I didn't see any value in that. And I really didn't want to let him recapture with his knight (or bishop that goes to g3). And I figure that I can block his h-pawn with my king so it doesn't feel like a bad threat yet. And I made this move the same night that I taught a lesson about passed pawns and how especially strong connected passed pawns are.  So it's an easy decision to play g4 here.
781,29,25,3c3,b'2r2bk1/6p1/R1N1p1n1/4P3/5PPp/2P1B3/1P6/6K1 b - -',I'm thinking of moving my knight to d4 soon so I plan to play b4 and Bd2 before I do.
782,29,26,3Nd4,b'2r2b2/4nkp1/R3p3/4P3/1P1N1PPp/2P1B3/8/6K1 b - -',"Bad bad bad move. 
This is the second time in a team game where I've had my moves planned out and then I made a move out-of-order. The last time I did it I had to immediately ask for a draw (and I think he pitied me and gave it to me). This time maybe I'm far enough ahead that I can still win ... but it'll take lots more work."
783,29,27,3Rxc3,b'5b2/4nkp1/R3p3/4P3/1P1N1PPp/2r1B3/8/6K1 w - -',Time to regroup. All of the plans I had are kind of shot.
784,29,28,3Bf2,b'5b2/4nkp1/R3p3/4P3/1P1N1PPp/2r5/5B2/6K1 b - -',Suddenly that pawn feels more dangerous. I don't think I can keep my b-pawn so I want this in a trade.
785,29,29,3Nd5,b'5b2/5kp1/R3p3/3nP3/1P1N1PPp/2r5/5B2/6K1 w - -',That's another strong move. As I said I've already written off the b-pawn mentally so I want to hold on to the others.
786,29,30,Be7,b'8/4bkp1/R3N3/3nP3/1P3PPp/2r5/5B2/6K1 w - -',"He saw my threat.
After Nxb4 I play 40. Ng5+. He has to retreat the king and I play Ra8+ to get the rook away from the knight and then Bxh4 leaving me with 3 pawns to his 1."

788,29,32,Ne3,b'8/5kp1/R7/4P1P1/1P4Pp/2r1n3/5B2/6K1 w - -',"I'm not sure why he didn't play Nxb4. Maybe he's hoping he can check me on c1 and eventually win my bishop. I plotted out the course after 
45. Bxe3   Rxe3
46. e6+    Rxe6
47 Rxe6    Kxe6
several times.
It looks like I can get his last two kingside pawns while he chases down the b-pawn and I can queen a pawn but maybe he plays 46.  ... Ke7 to just block that pawn instead of capturing it. I think I can do it but then I found an easier way."
789,29,33,4g6+,b'8/5kp1/R5P1/4P3/1P4Pp/2r1n3/5B2/6K1 b - -',That's the key move. It opens up the h4-d8 line.
790,29,34,4Kf8,b'5k2/6p1/R5P1/4P3/1P4Pp/2r1n3/5B2/6K1 w - -',I imagine he didn't want to play Ke2 so he wouldn't be in check on the next move but his king's in more trouble now.
