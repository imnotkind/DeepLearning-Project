(It's unfortunate that sometimes chess players are tested and 'fail' because the chess player is unable to respond with the correct chess tradition of the questioner).

I know strong players who don't use this Variation as they believe White ends up with a backwards Pawn for the rest of the game.  They'd be right until White loses the pawn of course.

101,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Well here it is: The advance variation. White immediately grabs central space and tries to cramp black's game. Notably Black's g8 knight is denied its favourite square (f6) and the c8 bishop will be difficult to develop. So what does black have in return? He has a solid pawn structure a strong dark squared bishop and importantly a potential target; white's centre.
102,4,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Striking at the base of white's central pawn chain is the logical continuation.
103,4,3,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Adding further support to white's centre.
104,4,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Developing whilst putting pressure on white's centre. 4. ...Qb6 has also been played to prevent 5. Be3.
105,4,5,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Same theme again; white develops and tries to hold onto his large centre. Time to mix things up a bit...
106,4,6,Nh6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p2n/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move looks absurd! White seems to be able to take my knight with 6. Bxh6 and leave black with doubled pawns. Well yes that's true but then I would gain several compensating advantages such as the bishop pair the ability to put my bishop quickly on the g7 square further pressuring white's centre potential f file pressure (after I play f6) and a few others. So what if White doesn't take on h6? My knight doesn't plan to stay on h6 but instead has ideas of moving in a couple of moves as we shall see.
107,4,7,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p2n/2ppP3/3P4/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a very common reply to 5. ...Qb6 so white was probably trying to stay in familiar territory by playing this move. However I am not obliged to transpose into white's opening of choice by playing 6. ...Qb6 so why should I?
108,4,8,f6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp4pp/2n1pp1n/2ppP3/3P4/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',! I now get my kingside involved in hammering white's centre. Note that although this move seems to weaken my kingside there is no way for white to exploit this as a check on the h5-e8 diagonal can be blocked by my knight.
109,4,9,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp4pp/2n1pp1n/2ppP3/3P4/P1PB1N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White reasons that against my seemingly irregular opening that development is the key.
110,4,10,Nf7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3npp/2n1pp2/2ppP3/3P4/P1PB1N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',! My knight slots in nicely with my pawn structure and also aims at white's e5 pawn. Now white must find the correct way to defend his attacked centre as I am threatening e5 with 3 pieces and it is only defended twice.
111,4,11,Bf4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3npp/2n1pp2/2ppP3/3P1B2/P1PB1N2/1P3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Mistake. 8. Qe2 was also bad. The path to equality was 8. exf6! conceding part of the centre. White can't hold onto his overlarge centre and after this greedy move black causes serious dis-coordination amongst the white pieces.
112,4,12,g5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3n1p/2n1pp2/2ppP1p1/3P1B2/P1PB1N2/1P3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq g6',! Lashing out at the bishop. The weakening of the pawn structure is unimportant in this position as white will have no time (or piece coordination) with which to take advantage of it.
113,4,13,Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3n1p/2n1pp2/2ppP1p1/3P4/P1PBBN2/1P3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',9. Bg3 was more consistent with defending the centre but it has the same reply as this move.
114,4,14,g4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3n1p/2n1pp2/2ppP3/3P2p1/P1PBBN2/1P3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',! Driving back white's knight to a passive square. This will allow me to safely win a pawn in the centre.
115,4,15,1Nfd2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3n1p/2n1pp2/2ppP3/3P2p1/P1PBB3/1P1N1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This move was probably the best as the other squares were horrible places for the knight but now white will have problem's developing his queen's knight.
116,4,16,1fxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3n1p/2n1p3/2ppp3/3P2p1/P1PBB3/1P1N1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',No reason to delay taking the pawn for any longer. Now ironically BLACK's centre will dominate whereas before it was white's central pawn chain that cramped black!

123,4,23,1Bg3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2qn1p/2n5/2P1p3/3p2p1/P2B2B1/1P1NQPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Now that there is no pin the bishop had to retreat.

125,4,25,1f3,b'r1b1kb1r/pp2qn2/2n5/2P1p2p/3p2p1/P2B1PB1/1P1NQ1PP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',Creating a hole for the bishop so that it may finally come to a safe square.

130,4,30,2Nce4,b'r1b1k2r/pp3n2/2n4b/2q1p3/3pN2p/P2B1P2/1P1NQ1PR/R3K1B1 b Qkq -',Setting up a blockade on my central pawns. I will remove it later when my king is out of the centre.

136,4,36,Bd5,b'2kr3r/pp2qn2/2n5/1B1bp3/3pNb1p/P4P2/1P1NQBP1/2R1K2R w - -',If we now take a moment to asses the position we can see that black is clearly much better. Black's pieces take up active positions and exert a lot of central control whilst white has no good square for his dsb and his pieces also lack the space to manoeuvre effectively. 
137,4,37,Ng5,b'2kr3r/pp2q3/2n5/1B1bp1n1/3pNb1p/P4P2/1PRNQBP1/4K2R w - -',Now is the time to begin kingside operations so I bring my knight closer to the action.

144,4,44,3Nc4,b'2kr4/p7/2p5/4p3/2NpNb2/P4P1n/1P4R1/5KBr b - -',Now the threat to win a piece is gone but I am the exchange and a pawn up. 
145,4,45,3d3,b'2kr4/p7/2p5/4p3/2N1Nb2/P2p1P1n/1P4R1/5KBr w - -',My thinking was that threatening to promote a pawn should win even more material.

147,4,47,d2,b'3r4/p1k5/2p5/4p3/2N1Nb2/P4P2/1P1p4/6K1 w - -',And  now white must sacrifice further material to stop the pawn.
148,4,48,Rxd2,b'8/p1k5/2p5/4p3/2N2b2/P4P2/1P1r4/6K1 w - -',!? I could have taken with Bxd2 and be a rook up but then white would be free to take my e pawn and his king would be unrestricted. Now however if white doesn't take my rook then his king is stuck on the back rank and he is unable to take my e pawn. If he does then he has only simplified the game even further making the win easy.
149,4,49,Bxd2,b'8/p1k5/2p5/4p3/8/P4P2/1P1b4/6K1 w - -',And now a piece up I win easily.

Were Bd4 or a queen move better?  White however seems to be moving toward a swift Kingside attack and this N move fits that general idea I guess.

253,7,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I usally play e5 after this move. Black is pushing some pressure onto white's e-pawn.
254,7,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The e4 pawn is attacked twice and defended twice and after ...dxe4 dxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 and white would win. So Nf6 might not have been the best move to play.
255,7,5,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',!? I personally wouldn't play this move I would play Bg5. But since black has just covered the e5 square d4 stops Nxe5 after e5. So I agree with both sides and think this is just a normal move.

But black can play Nxd4 and that threatens the white queen and the fork on c2 and if Qd2/Qd3 black would win by playing Nxe5! 
262,7,12,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pN3/3n2n1/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',!! Now black has multiple threats. Id Nxg4 tgeb Bxe2 and black wins. If Qxg4 Nxc2+ Kd1 Nxa1 wins. But if Qd3 Nxe5 wins a pawn (since after Qxd4 Nc6 and black ends up a pawn ahead.

269,7,19,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bb2/3Qn3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',? Carless white can now play Qxb7 winning a pawn. Even though black's two bishops are standing guard black will lose a pawn but after Qxb8 Rb8 Qe4 black wins a tempo while white wins a pawn and white clears the b-file.
270,7,20,Qd4,b'r4rk1/pQp2ppp/4bb2/4n3/3q4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',?! Why not play Rb8. What use is this move? Qxc3 bxc3 and white is seven points ahead. Or is black aiming at f2? White can now play Qxc7.

273,7,23,1Rd1,b'r2r2k1/pQp2ppp/4bb2/4n3/3q4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BR2K1 b - -',A rook skewer! After Qh4 Rxd8+ Bxd8 Qxa8 and white ends up a rook ahead. Is there anyway to stop the skewer? 
274,7,24,1Qb6,b'r2r2k1/pQp2ppp/1q2bb2/4n3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BR2K1 w - -',Black thinks there's no way to stop it!
275,7,25,1Rxd8+,b'r2R2k1/pQp2ppp/1q2bb2/4n3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B3K1 b - -',After the rook exchange white swoops in a piece ahead (rook and pawn of course)>
276,7,26,1Bxd8,b'r2b2k1/pQp2ppp/1q2b3/4n3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B3K1 w - -',A bishop on the rim is dim? No no no well this bishop on the rim might be dim but if the c7 pawn was out of the way the bishop on the rim will not be dim. This rim on the dim thing only works for knight's not bishops. Anyway Qxa8 and white wins.
277,7,27,1Qxa8,b'Q2b2k1/p1p2ppp/1q2b3/4n3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B3K1 b - -',Now the bishop is pinned! But the bishop is not lost. c6 solves the problem (or c5).
278,7,28,1Nc6,b'Q2b2k1/p1p2ppp/1qn1b3/8/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B3K1 w - -',?? He chose Nc6. This move blocks the white queen but there is one move that saves the day!
279,7,29,1Bf3,b'Q2b2k1/p1p2ppp/1qn1b3/8/8/2N2B2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 b - -',It is Bf3! Whatever black does he will lose a piece. Bd7 Bxc6 Bxc6 Qxd8+ wins. Nc4 Qxd8+ wins and Qb8  either Bxc6 or Qxc6 will win. (Qxc6 is probarly better.) unless black plays...
280,7,30,1Nb8,b'Qn1b2k1/p1p2ppp/1q2b3/8/8/2N2B2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - -',Nb8. Similarly like what I was talking to you about on move 16 this time the knight on the rim is dim because it can only move to four squares. Wait let's get off the game a minute and exterminate the pieces. Look whites DSB isn't even out yet as his a1 rook is in bed sleeping in the corner. What do you think about white's pawn structre and what do you think about black's pawn structre? At the moment which side has a more powerful attack? Answers please view on comments. Thank you.  
281,7,31,1Nd5,b'Qn1b2k1/p1p2ppp/1q2b3/3N4/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 b - -',"!? What do you think about this move? 
Again answers on comments please. Is it intresting duibious blunder good move? Whatever. "
282,7,32,1Bxd5,b'Qn1b2k1/p1p2ppp/1q6/3b4/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - -',Black is not defending very well and white is not attacking very well either. Now black has only got a few pieces left he needs to think about the way he plays. It is no good exchanging things. If you moved your queen white's Queen and bishop are blocked. At the moment black is three points down...
283,7,33,2Qxd5,b'1n1b2k1/p1p2ppp/1q6/3Q4/8/5B2/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 b - -',"And now he is 6 points down. Is black's structre better? Worse?

286,7,36,2Be3,b'1n1b2k1/p4p1p/1qp3p1/8/8/3QBB2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',! If black plays Qxb2 (which he probarly will do) white wins by playing Qxd8+ and gets to be 8 points up. Let's see if black falls into the trap.
287,7,37,2Qxb2,b'1n1b2k1/p4p1p/2p3p1/8/8/3QBB2/PqP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Uh-oh he does. Black is being very carless and now the game is lost for black. Luckily I've filmed it until white mated so you'll see how white managed to mate.
288,7,38,Kg7,b'1n1Q4/p4pkp/2p3p1/8/8/4BB2/PqP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Black is losing. This move is the only move but is terrible.

290,7,40,2Qxd4+,b'1n6/p4pkp/2p3p1/8/3Q4/5B2/P1P2PPP/R5K1 b - -',And the game is definetly lost for black. The firing squad could obviously finish of the game.

296,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',For a detailed description of the first three moves (and Whites fourth move) see the annotation of Part I of this series!
297,8,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/4p3/1PN5/PBPP1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq f6',The standard theory move here is the logical 4... Nf6. I don't know if the pawn double-step (that obviously is primarily done to keep the won pawn) here is sound as it kind of contradicts elementary opening rules namely that you shouldn't make too many pawn moves but instead develop your pieces quickly in the first stage of the game! This is especially essential when you accepted a gambit and therefore sacrificed development and initiative for material. Note that White already has two minor pieces developed one of them being a bishop sitting on a mighty long diagonal while Blacks fellows are all lazy in the back-camp so far. So my guess is that 4... Nf6 is better but I have to check out what the literature (Thomas Johansson - The Fascinating Reti Gambit) says about this line sometimes in future I don't own this book yet.
298,8,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/4p3/1PNP4/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Challenging Blacks strong pawn centre threatening to win the pawn back. 
299,8,3,exd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/8/1PNp4/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black does me a great favour and takes and now I can develop another minor piece in the next move. Note that the opponent only made pawn moves so far in the first five moves! Maybe 5... Nf6 would have been better leading to the possible continuation (not computer-checked yet): 6. dxe4 Qxd1+ 7. Rxd1 fxe4 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 10. Rd4 Bc5 11. Rc4 0-0 12. Nh3 with attacking chances for both sides.
300,8,4,Bxd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Three pieces out versus zero. Blacks troops are still sleeping (or celebrating because of the won pawn).
301,8,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Finally Black starts to develop.
302,8,6,Qe2,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/5p2/8/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',A logical move since it prepares to castle queen-side (which is done most of the time in the Reti gambit -- the rook has an excellent place on the open d-file where the opponents queen is sitting) and it also threatens Bxf5 winning the pawn back and leaving Black with an ugly isolated pawn.
303,8,7,Nd4,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/3n4/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',I remember that I kind of overlooked this move that attacks my queen. But well since the opponent moved his horse twice (breaking another opening rule) it also doesn't hurt for me to move my lady another time regarding development.
304,8,8,Qd2,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/3n4/1PNB4/PBPQ1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq -',8. Qe3 would have been worth considering probably. I'm not sure what I was afraid of.
305,8,9,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/1b1n4/1PNB4/PBPQ1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Develops another piece and pins my knight. It looks quite dangerous considering that queen and king are in the target line of his evil bishop but on the other hand it isn't too easy to exploit that.
306,8,10,O-O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/4p3/5p2/1b1n4/1PNB4/PBPQ1PPP/2KR2NR b kq -',White has almost finished development now only one piece needs to move to have nice position with connected rooks. Note that Black still needs at least four moves to accomplish the same.
307,8,11,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/5p2/1b1n4/1PNB4/PBPQ1PPP/2KR2NR w kq -',Black is ready to castle king-side now and can place this knight on the strong square d5 where the pressure on my knight on c3 would increase.
308,8,12,1Nge2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/5p2/1b1n4/1PNB4/PBPQNPPP/2KR3R b kq -',The last missing piece gets out and challenges Blacks horse in the centre! At the time playing I avoided 10. Nf3 because if Black decided to take 10... Nxf3 gxf3 would have corrupted my pawn structure. But now I realise that the open g-file could have been very useful then considering Black probably castled king-side so maybe it would have been worth it! Anyway this way it was also not bad as we will see soon.
309,8,13,1Nxe2+,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/5p2/1b6/1PNB4/PBPQnPPP/2KR3R w kq -',I guess it would have been wiser for Black to get his king to a safe place instead of helping White by freeing the queen from the pin comfortably and remove clutter from the powerful d-file empowering the rook. For example 10... 0-0 11. Bxf5 exf5 (... Nxf5? Qxd8 Rxd8 Rxd8+ winning the Exchange) 12. Qxd4 (or the more dangerous Nxd4) with an about equal position.
310,8,14,1Qxe2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/4pn2/5p2/1b6/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/2KR3R b kq -',Still a pawn down White clearly enjoys the superior position now. The immediate threat is Bxf5 winning the pawn back and simultaneously attacking the queen.
311,8,15,1Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1q1pp/4pn2/5p2/1b6/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/2KR3R w kq -',Blacks queen decides to go out of the firing line.
312,8,16,1Rhe1,b'r1b1k2r/ppp1q1pp/4pn2/5p2/1b6/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b kq -',Increasing the pressure on the half-open e-file and renewing the threat Bxf5.
313,8,17,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4pn2/5p2/1b6/1PNB4/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Finally also Blacks king gets to a safe place -- at least for some time. Note that the idea of attacking the knight on c3 another time thinking that it can't move because the rook on e1 is exposed then and one could win the Exchange fails and leads to the loss of a piece: 12... Nd4 13. Nxd5 exd5 (the queen was attacked!) 14. Qxe7+ Bxe7 (now the bishop is back again and pinned) 15. Ba3! and the bishop is history.
314,8,18,1Bxf5,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4pn2/5B2/1b6/1PN5/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b - -',Yes this still works the bishop waited a long time for his move! Material is even now again.
315,8,19,1Bxc3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4pn2/5B2/8/1Pb5/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',? Weakens my queen-side but loses the pair of bishops and throws away a piece that was quite active.
316,8,20,Qa3+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/4pn2/5B2/8/qPB5/P1P1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Okay this is what he had in mind -- unpinning the pawn on e6 with check trying to punish the bishop on f5 for using a simple tactical trick before. Good idea (that I overlooked) but it doesn't work.
317,8,21,1Bb2,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/4pn2/5B2/8/qP6/PBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b - -',Of course I have to keep the queen occupied. The at first sight more logical 15. Kb1?? would lose a piece 15... exf5.
318,8,22,1Qxa2,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/4pn2/5B2/8/1P6/qBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',Yes it costs a pawn. The queen looks dangerous here on this square so close to my king but in fact she isn't doing any harm at all.
319,8,23,1Bxe6+,b'r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/4Bn2/8/8/1P6/qBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b - -',I get the pawn back immediately in the centre.
320,8,24,1Kh8,b'r1b2r1k/ppp3pp/4Bn2/8/8/1P6/qBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',My guess is that 16... Bxe6 trading the undeveloped bishop against my very active one and connecting rooks would have been stronger.
321,8,25,1Bc4,b'r1b2r1k/ppp3pp/5n2/8/2B5/1P6/qBP1QPPP/2KRR3 b - -',This way I decide to keep my strong piece.
322,8,26,1Bg4,b'r4r1k/ppp3pp/5n2/8/2B3b1/1P6/qBP1QPPP/2KRR3 w - -',I was glad at that point that my f2-pawn still exists.
323,8,27,1Qe7,b'r4r1k/ppp1Q1pp/5n2/7b/2B5/1P3P2/qBP3PP/2KRR3 b - -',All hail to the 7th rank! Threatens Rd7 (threatens mate on g7 in turn) the next move; if ... Nxd7?? then Qxg7#. Notice the huge impact the mighty bishop on b2 has in this position!
324,8,28,1Qa5,b'r4r1k/ppp1Q1pp/5n2/q6b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KRR3 w - -',?? The final blunder that loses the game. Looks good as it defends the c7 and tries to get the queen back into the game. However it enables White to play a devastating...
325,8,29,2Re5,b'r4r1k/ppp1Q1pp/5n2/q3R2b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 b - -',... double attack! Note that Rd7 was probably still a playable option though one has to be careful not to leave the rook on e1 undefended that is eyed by Blacks queen now! However this way involving simple tactics seemed to be more safe and simple (and lust but not least fun!) to me.
326,8,30,2Rfe8,b'r3r2k/ppp1Q1pp/5n2/q3R2b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 w - -',A last straw hoping that I apply the wrong move order.
327,8,31,2Qxe8+,b'r3Q2k/ppp3pp/5n2/q3R2b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 b - -',Of course 21. Rxa5?? Rxe7 would not have won anything.
328,8,32,2Nxe8,b'r3n2k/ppp3pp/8/q3R2b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 w - -',I have no idea why he didn't take with the rook which seems to be much more natural to me compared to take a step back to the first rank with the horse leaving the bishop undefended.
329,8,33,2Rxa5,b'r3n2k/ppp3pp/8/R6b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 b - -',White is a whole rook ahead now in material.
330,8,34,2Nd6,b'r6k/ppp3pp/3n4/R6b/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 w - -',...
331,8,35,2Rxh5,b'r6k/ppp3pp/3n4/7R/2B5/1P3P2/1BP3PP/2KR4 b - -',"Small gifts will best maintain friendship (""Kleine Geschenke erhalten die Freunschaft"" as we say in German). Black wisely decided to resign at this point. This is another game which shows how powerful and fun to play the Reti gambit can be. I'm pretty sure my opponent has lots of experience with the French defence and has played hundreds of games with it with the standard theory (following the normal 2. d4 d5) and if I played the let's say advance variation (3. e5) like I did in earlier times he probably would have played much stronger and killed me. However with this nice anti-French gambit I could nicely squeeze out an advantage right from the beginning and improve it more and more with quite simple moves. Feel free to comment!"

Nf6 would have also moved the queen on if Black really wanted that with better benefits.

White could also have played Bb6 to threaten Qd8# but Bd7/Be6 and f6 defend against it and the knight can no longer go to b6 himself (whereas the bishop will be equally effective at a5).
363,10,11,Qf6,b'r1b1kb1r/1pQ1np1p/p4qp1/4p3/N2p4/1N1P4/PP1B1PPP/3R1RK1 w kq -', I don't know what the queen is doing here.  It's on a locked-up diagonal and doesn't attack any of the essential squares.  The one thing it would do is defend d8 after Nd5.  Nd5 now works better attacking the queen and either breaking up the attack or forcing it to redirect by taking b6 away from the knight.

Right now I can win a point but I think that it is too risky at this moment.

Any attempt to stop the fork by using the a1 rook would hang the a2 pawn and allow black's rook to move to b8 and undermine the pawn structure.

526,14,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',? I made this move to trap his LSB as soon as I could but this is not the proper continuation of the Sicilian Defense.  Therefore 3...a6 would have been my best move.  If however 1.e4c5 2.Nf3d6 3.d4 then 3...cxd4 would be best.

I wanted to put him at a strategical disadvantage because I believe that this is an open position but I am not sure since I do not know the difference between an open and a closed position.  In an open position the bishops are more powerful then knights.  I was however wrong because he will not exchange his LSB.

However I overlooked and forgot about his knight on c3.  This is now a ""recipe for disaster"" as they say.  Although the game is not lost I am in big trouble because I still have not developed my other knight or DSB.  Therefore I cannot castle on the King's side or connect my rooks but my opponent has already castled as I had mentioned earlier.  "

That way I would win a rook and be eight point ahead.  However this turns out to be a mistake because he can win a pawn and a rook if he plays Bxg7 and I overlooked this possibility.  Therefore 14...exd5 would have been my best move as I had mentioned earlier.  At the same time it is starting to get ugly because I am overlooking more moves.

I do not know why I made this move but this was my worst move in the entire game.  17...exd7 would have been by far my best move.  First it would have been an ""even exchange"" so I would have still been three points ahead.  Second it is no longer possible for me to castle.  In addition I will no longer be ahead because he will recapture a bishop (my LSB) with 17.exd7 and I overlooked all of these details.  Therefore I will be a point behind instead of three points ahead and it has become ugly and will only get worse from here. "

In other words I wanted to capture his d7 pawn so that the score would be 0 but what was I thinking?  After all I cannot capture his pawn with Nxd7 because his pawn was already on d7 before I played Nf6.  Therefore Rd8 would have been my only move.  It is because ""That looses immediately"" as Jack Stockel would say because he will get an inevitable pawn promotion and will place me in a very serious check after 18.d8=Q+.  Of course I overlooked this position.  "

552,14,31,2Qc6,b'3Qnk1r/pp4pp/2q5/4Rp2/1np5/1PB2N2/P1P2PPP/R5K1 w - -',?? In this position I am forced to retreat my queen and this is my only option.  If I move my queen anywhere else he will capture it for free.  In addition he will capture my knight so this will be a very serious check because he will play 21.Bxb4+.  In addition he will be eight points ahead.
553,14,32,Kf7,b'3Qn2r/pp3kpp/2q5/4Rp2/1Bp5/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R5K1 w - -',?? This was also a serious mistake because he can mate in one move if he plays 22.Qe7# and I missed that possibility.  21...Kg8 would have been my best move.  However I am also lucky that he did not find this mating pattern but the game is still lost. 
554,14,33,2Ng5+,b'3Qn2r/pp3kpp/2q5/4RpN1/1Bp5/1P6/P1P2PPP/R5K1 b - -',However it is almost as bad as Qe7# because 22...Kg8 will be forced so I just wasted a move.

White's Q-side pawn structure is just about fixed at this point - and not to his advantage because the holes Black will occupy are of the opposite color of White's remaining Bishop meaning the only piece he can use to dislodge a posted piece (without losing material) is his Knight which Black will exchange in a heartbeat for his Bishop if he can.

702,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Bobby Fischer loves to open up the game instead of just playing d4 he plays e4.
703,22,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Obviously the sicilian. Probably the best scoring defenses black can play here.
704,22,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White continues with Nf3. Simple development move trying to control the center with his minor pieces. Typically you want to bring out Knights before bishops and thats exactly what Bobby Fischer did. FYI this is his highest rating achieved.
705,22,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now black's gonna play Nc6. Again simple development move. This is getting ready for the accelerated Dragon.
706,22,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Bobby Fischer plays d4. Both pawns will be exchanged.
707,22,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Take.
708,22,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And take(As expected).
709,22,7,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues with g6 which is continuing with the accelerated dragon. In typical Dragon pawn comes to d6 and is later pushed up to d5. Later on the dpawn goes to d5 directly.
710,22,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Simple development move trying to control the center.
711,22,9,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black controling that long diagonal and will soon develop his other minor pieces.
712,22,10,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Developing.

715,22,13,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Safety for the King.
716,22,14,Bb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Now Bobby Fischer plays Bb3. The reason for this is that Bobby Fischer loves to sit back and eye down the f-pawn putting tons of pressure on black. This also sets up the trap. It attempts to lure the Knight to a5. Black is looking to trade off pieces here.
717,22,15,Na5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/n7/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Knight is lured.
718,22,16,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/n3P3/3N4/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Pawn attacks Knight and the Knight really has no place to go. Continuations are 9. e5 Nh4 10. g4 and the Knight is trapped. If Knight goes to g4 it gets taken same with Nd5 and the best move would be Nxb3. Continuation would be 10. exf6 Nxa 11. fxg7 Nxc2 12. Qxc2 Kxg7 and White is dominating in development. 
719,22,17,Ne8,b'r1bqnrk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Only move.
720,22,18,1Bxf7+,b'r1bqnrk1/pp1ppBbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',f-pawn needs to be taken for trap to work. You'll see why. Continuations 10. Bxf7 Kxf7 11. Ne6 dxe6 12. Qxd8 or 10. Bxf7 Rxf7 11. Ne6 dxe6 12. Qxd8 so no matter what black loses his Queen.
721,22,19,1Rxf7,b'r1bqn1k1/pp1pprbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Lets say he takes with rook.
722,22,20,1Ne6,b'r1bqn1k1/pp1pprbp/4N1p1/n3P3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',As expected. Here he can moove Queen or he can take with pawn. Best move would be Qc7 so he can win the Knight.
723,22,21,1Nxc7,b'r1b1n1k1/ppNpprbp/6p1/n3P3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Black loses Queen.
724,22,22,1Nxc7,b'r1b3k1/ppnpprbp/6p1/n3P3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',And Black takes back. This is a nice little trap that Bobby Fischer has used many times and I will also try to use it as many times as possible too. 
725,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The usual King's Pawn opening.  I am used to seeing this because 1.e4 is also my favorite opening.
726,23,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',"This is the ""cornerstone"" of the Sicilian Defense and I like it better then the King's Pawn Game.  First it prevents some of white's pieces from breaking through.  Second it is more aggressive then 1...e5.  In other words the Siclian Defense is more of an attack then a defense.  However the King's Pawn Game is more of a defense then an attack.  Most importantly white cannot get away with violating Opening General Principles if 1...c5 is played.  As Bobby Fisher would say ""Best by Test"" but I do not know if that statement applies to opening principles.   "
727,23,2,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"?  This is his first blunder.  In this position he is trying to get a ""Scholars Mate"" but I am not going to let him mate me in four moves.  In addition he has violated an opening principle because this does not give him a tactical advantage.  Therefore he is supposed to develop his knight before the bishop.  To top it off the game is unofficially lost.  This was not his loosing blunder but I will be as aggressive as I can.  In other words I will show no mercy when he makes more blunders.  I generally defeat my opponents with their own mistakes but that is especially true in this game.  That is because I feel insulted when people attempt this dirty trick especially a team game even though I am not angry.  This attitude however is a blunder as it causes stubbornness and inflexibility.  On the other hand it does not cost me in this game.      "
728,23,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',"! At this point I decide to transpose the Sicilian Defense into the French Defense as a result of his last move.  This is the proper response to an attempted ""Four Move Trick"" because it reduces the bishops diagonal.  In addition I am not going to show amnesty as I had mentioned earlier.  "
729,23,4,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',"? I am surprised that he made this move.  That is because it is no longer feasible to get a ""Scholars Mate"" in this position due to my last move.  BTW I am referring to 2...e6.  However this is also a blunder and another violation of Opening General Principles.  That is because you are not supposed to bring the queen out early and this mistake will cause him problems later in the game.  "
730,23,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',! I decided to chase his queen due to his last move.  Therefore he has just wasted a tempo.
731,23,6,Qf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',That is because he is forced to retreat his queen immediately after he brings it out.

733,23,8,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/1Bpp4/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',However that does not happen.  Instead he places me in check but I do not mind because it is a mere nuisance.
734,23,9,Bd7,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1Bpp4/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',? In my opinion 5...Nc7 might have been my best move.  If I had responded with my knight I might not have been able to force an exchange but it would have protected my LSB.  Afterall I believe that this is an open position if I am correct.  Therefore the bishop is more powerful then the knight.  On the other hand this was not my worst move because he will also loose a bishop.  As a result the score will be even when 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7 are played.   
735,23,10,Nc3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/2pp4/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',I do not know why he chose this candidate because he cannot play 8.Nxd5 due to my e6 pawn.  In addition he is not going to Fianchetto his DSB or castle queenside.

That is because I will exchange my knight for his queen when 8...Nxf3+ 9.gxf3 are played.  Therefore he will be six points behind and have two weak f pawns.  
738,23,13,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/1Npp4/4P3/5P2/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',! I made this move to chase his knight.

744,23,19,1Nef4,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/2p5/3pPN2/5P1N/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',?? He made this move to exchange his knight with my bishop.  In most cases the positions are open.  I am btw referring to open positions.  Therefore bishops are generally worth more then knights.  This time however I will accept that exchange with 13...Bxf4 14.Nxf4.  I do not mind because I am still ahead.
745,23,20,Qd6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p2qpn2/2p5/3pPN2/5P2/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',! I chose this candidate to chase his knight away but that will not happen this time.  I originally thought that I had made a bad choice but I was wrong.  That will be explained shortly.
746,23,21,1e5,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p2qpn2/2p1P3/3p1N2/5P2/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',?? This is the reason that I thought 14...Qd6 was a blunder.  However I forgot that this is a bigger blunder.  He chose this candidate to chase my queen away but that will not happen.  Instead I will win another free pawn with Qxe5+ so I will be seven points ahead instead of six.
747,23,22,1Ne2,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2p1q3/3p4/5P2/PPPPNP1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',! This was his best move.  In this position he still has the chance to castle Kings side.  If 16.Kd1 or 16.Kf1 that chance would have been gone.
748,23,23,1Qd5,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2pq4/3p4/5P2/PPPPNP1P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',! I made this move for two important reasons.  First I wanted to win his f3 pawn and play a powerful fork between his knight and rook.  Second he would then be forced to castle or retreat his rook.  What will really happen?  That will be explained during the next couple of moves.   
749,23,24,1Nf4,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2pq4/3p1N2/5P2/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',He chose this candidate to chase my queen away but it does not matter what he plays.  That is because I will win his f3 pawn with 17.Qxf3 wherever he moves.  Therefore I will be eight points ahead as opposed to seven. 
750,23,25,1Nxe6,b'r4rk1/1p3ppp/p3Nn2/2p5/3p4/5q2/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',?? He made this move because he thought that he would win my e6 pawn.  In addition he wanted to chase f8 rook away but this turns out to be a very serious blunder.  That is because I will play 18...Qxh1+.  Therefore I will win his h1 rook and he will officially loose the chance to castle as he will be forced to play 19.Ke2.  Then I will win his e6 knight with 19...fxe6 so he will be 15 points behind.
751,23,26,2b3,b'r4rk1/1p4pp/p3pn2/2p5/3p4/1P6/P1PPKP1P/R1B4q b - -',He chose this candidate because he wanted to fianchetto his DSB and this brings him one step closer to doing that.

753,23,28,2Bb2,b'r4rk1/1p4pp/p3p3/2p5/3pn3/1P6/PBPPKP1P/R6q b - -',?? He chose this candidate to form the fianchetto as I had mentioned earlier.  However 21.Kd3 would have been his best move as it would have avoided a mating threat.  At this point however I now have an inevitable mating pattern and it is a mate in 3.  In other words I will mate him in three moves with 21...Rxf2+ 22.Kd3 (forced) Rxd2+ 23.Kc4 (forced) b5#.  In fact I created a chess puzzle based on this game and it was btw my last puzzle.  In the puzzle I mentioned that I would annotate this game at some point.

798,25,0,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Normally I play 6...Nc6 the Panno Variation; but I been reading some Joe Gallagher.  Gallagher felt that the type of players that played the Fianchetto Variation liked to feel in control and the way get them out of their comfort zone was to create chaos on the board and disrupt the flow of their games.  So I play ...Ndb7 hoping to be able to transpose into the Gallagher Variation.

Visually I didn't like my position but I have a supported passed pawn and White's h4-Knight is on the rim and no easy way back into the game.  I remembered Larsen once summing up a position as both sides stand badly.  That seemed to apply here.

Since black's knight is still pinned he can't just take my knight. Also it treatened to win black's queen by doing Ne5 next move (since the Bishop on a4 was protected now). Because of that black couldn't play fxg5 or Bxe1 in next move as this would have let me capture the queen.
828,26,15,1b5,b'r1b1k2r/2pq2pp/p1N2p2/1p1p2B1/B3n3/2N5/PPP2bPP/R2QRK2 w kq b6',?? Now this move surprised me I was simply expecting bxc6. It really seems to be a blunder as the gameknot analyzer changes the rating from +0.55 to +5.69 for white. Amusingly I wasn't aware of that at this point I still thought the position is quite equal.
829,26,16,1Nxe4,b'r1b1k2r/2pq2pp/p1N2p2/1p1p2B1/B3N3/8/PPP2bPP/R2QRK2 b kq -',"Now have a closer look at this position I just find it too nice ;-). It seems that 4 of my pieces (both knights and both bishops) are 'en prise'. Furthermore my rook still could be taken with black's Bishop so black actually had 5 possible captures at this point ;-). Of course at the current position I had captured 2 knights while black only had 2 pawns.

White's other pawns (files b-f) need to capture a combined total of 15 black pieces (black's entire army except the king) so they cannot push either. That leaves either the g or h pawn or a knight as the first move of this proof.
839,27,1,hxg4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp2/8/8/6pp/4R3/PPPPPP2/RNBQKBN1 w Qkq -',The idea is to promote black's g and h pawns using white's own g and h pawns as a sacrifice.

860,28,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',d6 is the most common move here by black but Nc6 is absolutely playable. The idea is to challenge the d4 square.
861,28,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Bc4 is not a move I have seen often. The gameknot database suggests that it is slightly inferior to the more common move of d4 (initiating the pawn exchange by black). Bb5 and Nc3 also yield better results for white overall.
862,28,4,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Planning to play d5 driving back whites LSB gaining tempo space and control of the centre.
863,28,5,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Developing the knight to a good square and preventing d5 for the moment.
864,28,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Developing the knight to a good square and preparing again to play d5.
865,28,7,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Activating the DSB and providing support.
866,28,8,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq d6',Finally I get to play d5 attacking whites bishop.
867,28,9,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Pawn exchange.
868,28,10,Bb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Retreat and loss of tempo. At this point I lose access to the GK database it shows that black has a reasonable advantage already presumably due to blacks stronger central control and small space advantage.
869,28,11,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I think this is a mistake as it allows white to capture the pawn on d5. Without access the the DB and having just got back from several months hitch hiking in West Africa where chess is almost unheard of I am a bit rusty. Better moves would have been Be7 or Bg4.
870,28,12,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Both sides get their king off the dangerous open e file.
871,28,13,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Stops any ideas of pinning whites knight with Bg4 but opens up other possibilities such as a sacrifice on h3. I think perhaps this move was a bit slow at this stage with Bg5 or Nxd5 being better alternatives.
872,28,14,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2p5/3p4/1BNP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Threatens the N and prevents Nxd5 but whites bishop now has a strong diagonal aiming at my king!
873,28,15,1Ne4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I think Nb5 is slightly better but I am not sure.
874,28,16,1h6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Three enemy pieces can land on g5 so I decide to secure it.
875,28,17,Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Contesting the crucial open e file. I later realised this to be a mistake. Nxe4 dxe4 then Re8 is a much better alternative as will be explained.
876,28,18,1c3,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/3pN3/1BPP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',c3?? Both players missed the significance of Nxf6+. The Queen cannot recapture on f6 because it would leave the rook on e8 attacked and undefended. After 12. Nxf6+ gxf6 13. Rxe8+ Qxe8 14. Bxh6 giving white a huge advantage.
877,28,19,1bxc3,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/4N3/1BPP1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The possibility of Nxf6+ is still there.
878,28,20,1Bf5,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p2b2/4N3/1BPP1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',The rook on e8 now has another defender making Nxf6 a less serious threat.
879,28,21,1Nxf6+,b'r2qr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1N1p/2p2b2/8/1BPP1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Too late!
880,28,22,1Bb2,b'r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1q1p/2p2b2/8/1BPP1N1P/PB3PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Eyeing up the black Queen but white cannot open the diagonal until the bishop on b2 is defended.
881,28,23,1Rxe1+,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2nb1q1p/2p2b2/8/1BPP1N1P/PB3PP1/R2Qr1K1 w - -',I decided to exchange here because if white recaptures with the Queen I can win the d pawn and recapturing with the Knight weakens whites position.
882,28,24,Bxd3,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2nb1q1p/2p5/8/1BPb1N1P/PB3PP1/R3Q1K1 w - -',Munch.
883,28,25,c4,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2nb1q1p/8/2p5/1BPb1N1P/PB1Q1PP1/R5K1 w - -',c4! Defends my annoying bishop on d3 attacks whites bishop and advances a Queenside pawn where I now have a majority.
884,28,26,1Bc2,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2nb1q1p/8/2p5/2Pb1N1P/PBBQ1PP1/R5K1 b - -',Ba5 is better.
885,28,27,1Bf4,b'r5k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/8/2p2b2/2Pb1N1P/PBBQ1PP1/R5K1 w - -',Forces the Queen to d1 where defensive possibilities are more limited.
886,28,28,Rd8,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/8/2p2b2/2Pb1N1P/PBB2PP1/R2Q2K1 w - -',Secures the bishop and takes control of the open file. It is important to note that the rook is also defended here. Blacks pieces are now working together well. White has a cramped position his bishop on b2 is almost useless and it will be a few moves until his rook can have an influence on the game.
887,28,29,2Bxd3,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/8/2p2b2/2PB1N1P/PB3PP1/R2Q2K1 b - -',Bxd3? White tries to trade off the annoying piece but it allows the pawn on c4 to become passed and dangerously close to promotion.
888,28,30,2Rb1,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/8/5b2/2Pp1N1P/PB3PP1/1R1Q2K1 b - -',Rb1? g3 Bc7 Nd2 may have offered better resistance.
889,28,31,2c4,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/8/2P2b2/5N1P/PB1p1PP1/1R1Q2K1 b - -',White attempts to activate the DSB but it only makes black play a move that he wanted to play anyway...
890,28,32,2Qg6,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n3qp/8/2P2b2/5N1P/PB1p1PP1/1R1Q2K1 w - -',Qg6! Can you see the danger of this move? 
891,28,33,Qxb1,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2n4p/8/2P2b2/2B2N1P/P2p1PP1/1q1Q2K1 w - -',Qxb1!! Wins the rook outright as after Qxb1 d1=Q+ Qxd1 Rxd1 with mate to follow forcing immediate resignation. I'd like to thank my opponent kentathena for a good game!
892,29,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The first move is d4 which controls c5 and e5.
893,29,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black counters preventing e4 unless white wants to play a gambit.
894,29,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is not as agressive as c4 or e4 but white gets a solid center and takes black out of the opening books.
895,29,3,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Probably not the best move in the position.  Black is not quite sure where the bishop is best placed and b7 is weak.  Those two points are the reason behind my next move.
896,29,4,g4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P2P1/2P5/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',This appears to be my invention as I have not been able to find it on any databases.  Black will most likely take the pawn and will lose a tempo.
897,29,5,Bxg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2P5/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',There is no reason why black should decline the pawn.  In some cases white can simply get a better form of the gambit.  For example: 3...Bd7 4.Bf4 Bxg4 and white is a tempo ahead of the regular line. 
898,29,6,Bh3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White now tries to exchange the light squared bishops making the b7 square even weaker. 
899,29,7,Bh5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/3P4/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is a strange move as black up a pawn would like to trade down.  On the plus side the e pawn is pinned and the g1 knight is dicouraged from moving to f3.
900,29,8,Qb3,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Attacking the weak b7 pawn.  Bf4 might be better as the two white bishops are ready to attack on the queenside.
901,29,9,b6,b'rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p3b/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Pretty much forced unless black wants to lose a lot of material.  Now white should play Bf4 and wait for black to make a mistake.  For example: 6.Bf4 c5?? 7.Bxb8! Qxb8 8.Qb5+ Kd8 9.Qd7# 
902,29,10,Qb5+,b'rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/1Q1p3b/3P4/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',But this move is weak as black can win tempi because of the premature queen attack.  Bf4 is better.
903,29,11,c6,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/1Q1p3b/3P4/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Now the white queen loses a tempo.
904,29,12,Qa4,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/3p3b/Q2P4/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',Trying to keep the queen on the a4-e8 diagonal.
905,29,13,b5,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p1p3b/Q2P4/2P4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',This move is not great as the pawn structure is weakened and c5 becomes an outpost for a knight.
906,29,14,Qb3,b'rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p1p3b/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',The queen retreats and continues to put pressure on the b5 and d5 pawns.
907,29,15,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1p3b/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Black now plans to develop the dark square bishop.  Nf6 might have been better as it controls the e4 square.
908,29,16,Bf4,b'rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1p3b/3P1B2/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',The bishop develops to f4 and eyes the b8 knight.  Now the b1 knight can come to d2 and support an e4 push. 
909,29,17,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p1p3b/3P1B2/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',The knight comes out to f6 and guards the e4 square.
910,29,18,1Bg5,b'rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p1p2Bb/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',This probably wasn't the best move as it loses a tempo.  Better is Nd2.
911,29,19,1h6,b'rn1qkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p2Bb/3P4/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Be7 is slightly better but h6 is just fine.
912,29,20,1Bh4,b'rn1qkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/3P3B/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',Bf4 might have been a bit better.
913,29,21,1Be7,b'rn1qk2r/p3bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/3P3B/1QP4B/PP2PP1P/RN2K1NR w KQkq -',Now black blocks up the h4-d8 diagonal.  The white bishops are barely doing anything.
914,29,22,1Nd2,b'rn1qk2r/p3bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/3P3B/1QP4B/PP1NPP1P/R3K1NR b KQkq -',The plan might be Bxf6 and e4.
915,29,23,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/p3bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/3P3B/1QP4B/PP1NPP1P/R3K1NR w KQ -',Black castles but he probably should do something about the c6 pawn first. 
916,29,24,1f3,b'rn1q1rk1/p3bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/3P3B/1QP2P1B/PP1NP2P/R3K1NR b KQ -',Adding another attacker to the e4 square.  Bxf6 might have been better although it gives black the bishop pair.
917,29,25,1a5,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pn1p/pp1p3b/3P3B/1QP2P1B/PP1NP2P/R3K1NR w KQ a6',Not good as black's pawn structure gets even worse.  Now a4 here for white really would have caused problems for black.
918,29,26,1e4,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pn1p/pp1p3b/3PP2B/1QP2P1B/PP1N3P/R3K1NR b KQ e3',Too early.  Instead white should play a4 to halt black's queenside play.
919,29,27,1a4,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/p2PP2B/1QP2P1B/PP1N3P/R3K1NR w KQ -',This is why white should have played a4.  The white queen is forced even farther back.  Note however that black's pawn structure is very weak.
920,29,28,1Qc2,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p1p3b/p2PP2B/2P2P1B/PPQN3P/R3K1NR b KQ -',Now white runs into problems along the g6-b1 diagonal.
921,29,29,1Bg6,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pnbp/1p1p4/p2PP2B/2P2P1B/PPQN3P/R3K1NR w KQ -',Pinning the e4 pawn and causing lots of problems for white.
922,29,30,1Qd1,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/2p1pnbp/1p1p4/p2PP2B/2P2P1B/PP1N3P/R2QK1NR b KQ -',Here 16...exd5 17.fxe5 Nxe5 18.Nxe5 Bxe5 wins another pawn for black but opens up the position for an attack for white.
923,29,31,1c5,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/4pnbp/1ppp4/p2PP2B/2P2P1B/PP1N3P/R2QK1NR w KQ -',Black seeks to destroy the white center.  Now the b8 knight can come to c6.

926,29,34,1Bf2,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/4p1bp/1pppP2n/p2P4/2P2P1B/PP1N1B1P/R2QK1NR b KQ -',Better might be Bxe7 or Bg3.  White is in big trouble.
927,29,35,1Nf4,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/4p1bp/1pppP3/p2P1n2/2P2P1B/PP1N1B1P/R2QK1NR w KQ -',White is extremely cramped as Ne2 fails to Nxh3.
928,29,36,1Bf1,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/4p1bp/1pppP3/p2P1n2/2P2P2/PP1N1B1P/R2QKBNR b KQ -',White's king has no moves.  It looks like white might be the victim of a composition type mate.

942,29,50,2Kd1,b'rn3rk1/5pp1/4p1bp/1B1pP3/p7/4qP2/PP1N2nP/R2K1QNR b - -',Now black should play Nf4 and Bd3.

I was looking at a couple of variations including 17...Nh5 or B/Ng4. If Nh5 then white can just proceed with e5 or Rh4 (both of these are acceptable).
