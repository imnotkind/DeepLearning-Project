36,1,24,Rd8,b'3r2k1/pp3ppp/8/2q1r3/3R4/3R1Q2/PP4PP/6K1 w - -',Rook at d4 is pinned.  I can apply 3 - 2 attackers to defenders on this point.

40,2,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is ironically a relatively uncommon position here on gameknot.  Still I'm not afraid of playing the QGD -- I'm actually much more afraid of the QGA!
41,2,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',The pin on the knight can get annoying but black has a variety of ways to respond.
42,2,2,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I'm aiming for a setup that strong-points d5 protects the Nf6 with Nd7 and then the queen heads to a5 with a number of threats.  White plays the opening well though.
43,2,3,Qa5,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',The defining move of the Cambridge Springs variation.  Black threatens a number of strokes including Bb4 winning a pawn and dxc4 discovering an attack on the Bg5.

45,2,5,1Bd3,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p4/1bPP3B/2NBP3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Now white is playing for a buildup of forces aimed at black's kingside and so I start to get defensive.
46,2,6,1Nxc4,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q7/2NP3B/2PBP3/P1Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',A strong recapture hitting the queen and threatening to sink in to d6.

48,2,8,Rd8,b'r1br2k1/p2n1ppp/2pNpn2/1p5q/3P4/2PBP1B1/P1Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now black's 9th looks silly as the rook simply had to move again.  Black's pieces are not coordinated well at all whereas white has a well-deployed army.  At this point I need a plan.
49,2,9,Nf8,b'r1br1nk1/p4ppp/2pNpn2/1p5q/3P4/2PBP1B1/P1Q2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I decide to regroup on the kingside and try to get some fireworks happening there.
50,2,10,1a4,b'r1br1nk1/p4ppp/2pNpn2/1p5q/P2P4/2PBP1B1/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 b - a3',Wisely going after black's weak queenside.
51,2,11,1Ba6,b'r2r1nk1/p4ppp/b1pNpn2/1p5q/P2P4/2PBP1B1/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Finally a chance to get the bishop involved.  If I can get it exchanged for white's good one I'll be a lot happier.
52,2,12,cxb5,b'r2r1nk1/p4ppp/3Npn2/1p5q/3P4/2P1P1B1/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Mission accomplished.  Now white can't win a pawn with Nxb5 but flanders has plans to build up pressure on it...
53,2,13,1Qd3,b'r2r1nk1/p4ppp/3Npn2/1p5q/3P4/2PQP1B1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now Nxb5 is a real threat.
54,2,14,1a6,b'r2r1nk1/5ppp/p2Npn2/1p5q/3P4/2PQP1B1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',But this defends it adequately for now.
55,2,15,Ng6,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p2Npnn1/Rp5q/3P4/2PQP1B1/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',I figure that now's a good time to build up my pressure on the kingside -- I notice that white's back rank is weak with the second rook out of there.
56,2,16,2c4,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p2Npnn1/Rp5q/2PP4/3QP1B1/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',!  I like this move for white -- it showcases just how weak black's queenside is and how poorly positioned black's queen is.
57,2,17,2e5,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p2N1nn1/Rp2p2q/2PP4/3QP1B1/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',This was the best complication I could find made possible by Ng6 the move before.
58,2,18,2Ne4,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p4nn1/Rp2p2q/2PPN3/3QP1B1/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',Giving me breathing room!
59,2,19,exd4,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p5n1/Rp5q/2PpQ3/4P1B1/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',"And now I notice that 24. cxb5 axb5 25. Rxa8 is awful for black!

Nonetheless these exchanges have freed up my position a lot and that's a general rule for the person with cramped development to seek exchanges (even if you're down a pawn)."
60,2,20,2exd4,b'r2r2k1/5ppp/p5n1/Rp5q/2PPQ3/6B1/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',I thought cxb5 was better for white although that passed pawn on d4 could be bad for black now.
61,2,21,2f5,b'r2r2k1/6pp/p5n1/Rp3p1q/2PPQ3/6B1/5PPP/5RK1 w - f6',Still it looks like we've finally got a game going here!  Let's take stock.  White's got to move his queen after which black should be free to take on c4 and there should be a race between the passed pawns to see who can make something happen first.
62,2,22,2Qe6+,b'r2r2k1/6pp/p3Q1n1/Rp3p1q/2PP4/6B1/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',This check is the only move that allows white to keep his c-pawn.
63,2,23,2Kh8,b'r2r3k/6pp/p3Q1n1/Rp3p1q/2PP4/6B1/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',Much better than Kf8 which would get me killed by 26. Bd6 .
64,2,24,2Be5,b'r2r3k/6pp/p3Q1n1/Rp2Bp1q/2PP4/8/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',Threatening a variety of things -- still I've wanted that bishop out of there for a long time and so I'll take advantage of the opportunity!
65,2,25,2Qxe5,b'r2r3k/6pp/p7/Rp2Qp1q/2PP4/8/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',I wondered if dxe4 was better but then I realized how weak white's back rank is (black's is weak too)... if 27. dxe4 then Rd1 is strong for black!
66,2,26,2bxc4,b'r2r3k/6pp/p7/R3Qp1q/2pP4/8/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',... and now I get my passed pawn.  White can respond Qxf5 but after the exchange of queens black plays Rxd4 with a big advantage!  I'm pretty happy with the outcome of all of this although I'd be lying if I said I had planned it all this way.
67,2,27,2d5,b'r2r3k/6pp/p7/R2PQp1q/2p5/8/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',And now white pushes his pawn which has the added bonus of preventing black from playing c3.
68,2,28,2Rde8,b'r3r2k/6pp/p7/R2PQp1q/2p5/8/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',This kicks the queen off of her perch and off of the e-file entirely.
69,2,29,2Qd4,b'r3r2k/6pp/p7/R2P1p1q/2pQ4/8/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',Behind the passed pawn is the place to be.  Now I have to address the threat to the pawn on c4 and notice also that the g7 pawn is pinned.  So after a think I decided on...
70,2,30,2Qe2,b'r3r2k/6pp/p7/R2P1p2/2pQ4/8/4qPPP/5RK1 w - -',Qe2; probably the best move.  While it doesn't support the advance of c4 it prevents the Rf1 from moving into action since any move leads to Qe1  and mate to follow on the back rank.
71,2,31,3d6,b'r3r2k/6pp/p2P4/R4p2/2pQ4/8/4qPPP/5RK1 b - -',...whereas white is free to push his pawn.  Still the idea in the last note gave me a new idea especially since he didn't play something defensive like g3 or h3.  Notice that the Re8 cuts off all of the white king's flight squares and his back rank is weak.  So with the idea of forcing a mate on the back rank I play...
72,2,32,3Rab8,b'1r2r2k/6pp/p2P4/R4p2/2pQ4/8/4qPPP/5RK1 w - -',Rab8!?  This is a threat that must be addressed although there are many good ways to do it; the safest being Qd1.  But white overlooked my threat and played:
73,2,33,3d7,b'1r2r2k/3P2pp/p7/R4p2/2pQ4/8/4qPPP/5RK1 b - -',d7?  Threatening to take the rook on e8 to promote to a queen and give white an overwhelming advantage.  There's just one oversight...
74,2,34,3Qxf1+,b'1r2r2k/3P2pp/p7/R4p2/2pQ4/8/5PPP/5qK1 w - -',"!!  Sacrificing my queen *on purpose* for the very first time on gameknot!  After 32. Kxf1 Rb1  33. Qd1 Rxd1# is checkmate!  

Thanks to flanders for a good game and the chance to do something amazing!  Hope you enjoyed it too."
75,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I had never played Allen before -- a very spirited player (who's big on the spirits too)
76,3,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Asking for the Vienna gambit (2. ... Nf6 3. f4!)
77,3,2,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',??  This is odd; I expected black to develop a piece.  This move takes the c6 square away from the knight on b8.
78,3,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I don't know what awaits me so I go for simple development and guard against black seizing the center with d5.
79,3,4,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',So instead of d5 black opts for d6.  This opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the light-squared bishop but blocks in the dark-squared one!
80,3,5,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',Trying to open lines as I've got the advantage.  Black is inclined to take since otherwise f5 really puts a bind on black's development.
81,3,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Now I've got a third piece developed -- although this was necessary to dissuade Qh4  which can be devastating in the related King's Gambit accepted.
82,3,7,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?  Alright at this point I realize that black is way underdeveloped and I've got an ideal king's gambit/vienna gambit type setup.  All I have to do is get the rest of my pieces out and focus on attacking the black king.
83,3,8,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',d3 would have sufficed but why not grab the extra square?
84,3,9,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Finally developing his first piece on move 6; this is definitely coming a lot later than it ought.  The knight doesn't have many options in any case as white dominates the center.
85,3,10,Bxf4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPB2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',And now there's a 4-1 edge in piece development for white.  I don't see a breakthrough yet but there are many useful moves for me in waiting (0-0 for instance) while black has very little in the way of options.
86,3,11,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n1pp/2pp1p2/1p6/2BPPB2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq b6',?  Alright this is just silly now.  There's no reason not to try to develop pieces at this stage.  I took a look at Nxb5 here since I have such a developmental edge but white lacks a good follow-up to 8. Nxb5 cxb5 9. Bxb5# Bd7 so I reserve the decision here...
87,3,12,Bb3,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n1pp/2pp1p2/1p6/3PPB2/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Bd3 should also be worth considering but I didn't want to lessen my presence on black's kingside.
88,3,13,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp1p2/1p4p1/3PPB2/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq g6',??  Now this is unbelievable.  If I clear the knight out of f3 the queen can deliver a devastating check on h5.  I couldn't calculate all of the complications but simply thought whether it would be better to have a knight or bishop for the attack and to sac the other on g5.
89,3,14,Bxg5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp1p2/1p4B1/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Taking with the bishop first although in hindsight taking with the knight would have been very strong also.
90,3,15,1Nxg5,b'rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp4/1p4N1/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',At this point it's clear that white is going to go in for the kill and while black may be able to defend he certainly has his work cut out for him!

Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!? this however is definitely not dull and boring! Anybody who thinks it is send me a challenge and ask me to play it and we'll see how boring it is when  I beat you!

134,4,6,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',"This the move that signals the beginning of the Evans.  White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside Initiative with a quick attack on the Black king which will hopefully end in mate. Most  gambits like these give White an early initiative however  if Black can defend accurately he stands better in the ensuing endgame with plenty of chances for a win. When people tell me this I simply reply "" I don't give a crap I don't plan letting Black get into an endgame position anyway. Lol.""

One opinion (pulsaris'):

""As white opens up the center it's pieces are no longer obstructed by pawns and they can rapidly jump into play with high maneuverability. However since all the minor pieces remain on the board black is highly resourceful in terms of defense. This opening is primarily a psychological attempt to delude the opponent into an immediate state of panic as white targets the f7 pawn (that is so close to the king) with numerous pieces. If black manages to defend that pawn and holds up the basic chess principles White's steam will run out and that pawn will nostalgically possess a precious value. This opening doesn't leap before it jumps. In terms of modern chess that pawn is a premature giveaway and the opening itself is romantic at best ;)""

This is of course is partly true this is my opinion

""This so called ""romantic gambit"" by pulsaris has proven to be greatly resilient to modern technology while it is not generally thought of as a path to advantage it hasn't been refuted(correct me if I'm wrong which i am pretty certain I'm not!).The idea of this opening is to gain momentum while opening the centre. this is often at the expense of a pawn or two.For this reason this line of the Guoco Piano has often attracted attention from more aggressive players and and will probably continue to do so in the future. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times.  He even used it to beat none other than ANAND! Pretty good surprise weaponno? "

Alternatives here are the imediate 6.0-0 which is not so popular or 6.Qb3!? which starts an immediate atack. These moves are interchangeable though and are normally played at some stage of the game anway it depends on whatever swuits your style.

143,4,15,Bb6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',"Now we have reached a very common position from the Evan's Gambit. There are two main options I can take. I can aim for long term compensation with 9.d5 which Anderssen preffered. Many games with 9.d5 continue like 9...Na5 10.Bb2 Ne7 11. Bd3 0-0 12.Nc3 Ng6 13. Ne2 c5 14.Qd2 f6 15. Kh1 Rb8 16.Ng3. This would be the strategic positional approach with less attacking chances wich doesn't suit my style.. I prefer Morphy's more tactical and logical developing move 9.Nc3 when I maintain possibilities of advancing either of my two central pawns according to Black's moves. This is obviously a more dynamic approach in my opinion.
""Agreed. In the book I own on the Evans this is actually called ""The Normal Position""""-marinvukusic"
144,4,16,Nc3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I decide to go with the more logical developing move. Now i have developed 3 pieces got 2 central pawns holding the centre a safe castled king and good squares to develop pieces (i.e Qb3Ba3Re1 etc.) Black on the other hand has developed two pieces still has castled has his king wide open in the centre like a sitting duck in the eye of the storm waiting for the hurricane that will hopefully be me attack on him. Oh yes and what has he got a material advantage over me. This sounds very daunting but unfortunaetely it is not all good for white as if black can defend diligently hye will get a better endgame with a queenside pawn majority and overall better pawn structure.
145,4,17,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? This move looks like a good developing move however it is one of the traps of Morphy's continuation. This leaves Black in trouble this will show you why;

Why not take the knight you might say? Oh yeah because he doesn't want to  give white control of an open e-file. This is kind of smart.
Actually defending f7 is black's only play as white is threatening mate in two. If black takes the knight 12) ... exf3 then 13) Bxf7 Kd7 (only legal move) 14) Qe6#."

Black currently can't castle and once the Rh8 is exchanged off this kingside looks a little exposed. It's difficult to see quite how White should procede however since the tempting Rdg1 starts to look a little uncomfortable after moves like Qb6 and Nf5. Maybe the simple 24.hg followed by swapping rooks and Rh1 will suffice.

215,7,3,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',c3 chases the bishop away forcing it to move for a 3rd time in just the first 5 moves although black is compensated by having the pawn advantage.
216,7,4,Ba5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Ba5 is the most common move Be7 is another alternative.
217,7,5,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Whites bishops can become very strong later on in the game. d4 gives them move room to manouver while also contesting the center.

Or even cxd4 as a different option.
Personally i prefer to give black the chance to take the 3rd pawn as i'd rather black did not castle."

221,7,9,1Ba3,b'r1b1k2r/ppppnppp/2n5/b3Pq2/2B5/BQN2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',The bishop is now on a very strong diagonal. Black could castle but it would leave their knight pinned to the rook...

Black's knight is stuck on e5 because if it moves it leaves black open to a discovered check after either Nxc6  or Nxc8

231,8,1,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',a6 could be better before this move.
232,8,2,Bd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/1B1pN3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White attacks and have time for developing as black cannot breath.
233,8,3,Nxd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1Npppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White makes it easier for black. The change of attacking figures is worse then developing.
234,8,4,e6,b'r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/1B1p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Without the white bishop I try to defence the white squares make place for the kingside developing.

243,8,13,2f3,b'2k4r/1p1q1pp1/p7/8/3P1p2/3Q1P1r/PP4P1/3R1RK1 b - -',White made it.

247,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is Morphy's rock solid opening move that he never doubted not once did he stray as others did from 1.e4 even Bobby Fischer who was a devout !.e4 player played 1.d4 once.
248,9,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',?!Haven't we seen this before? Oh yes I have annotated one of Greco's games where he pulverized the Owens defence. This is wrong for one main reason and that is it lets Morphy monopolize the centre with his pawns so that Black's pieces will be unable to find a foothold in the centre later on.
249,9,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Morphy does the smart thing and aims for a tight grip on the centre.
250,9,3,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White saves time he defends the e4 pawn with a developing move which also prepares him for castling. 
251,9,4,Nh3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3B3N/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',! Oh my god! Has Morphy gone mad? No he hasn't! Blacks neglect of the centre does him a lot of harm. Whites neglect of the centre here (4.Nh3!?) does him no harm at all here! Why? By playing 4.Nh3! he leaves the path open for the advance of his f-pawn. The subsequent f2-f4-f5 move opens up the f-file for white's attacking forces later on. This move just proves Morphy's genius. However I wouldn't advise any people below Morphy's level of expertise to try one of these kind of moves as they will probably fall flat on their face.
252,9,5,d5,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/3PP3/3B3N/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',This position now resembles the French defence with the light squared Bishop aslo known as the 'Bad Bishop' fianchettoed. I suppose the Doc thought that this would be a bright move as it gets away blacks problem piece. Or does it? You'll see that this doesn't because the Pawns in the centre become locked a the fianchettoed Bishop is deemed useless because of it.
253,9,6,e5,b'rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P4/3B3N/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',As I said Morphy knows that the fianchettoed bishop could hurt him if he opened up the centre however he decides to lock the centre pawns so that the Bishop has almost no effect on the game because of the pawn on d5 which is choking it; on the other hand whites d3 bishop looks menacing with bright prospects. Also because of Morphys central Pawn advance he gains a greater space advantage and prohibits blacks kingside development. Blacks late bid for a share of centre will be unsatisfactory for him. 
254,9,7,Ne7,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp1nppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P4/3B3N/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The knight is totally ineefective here. Having neglected the control of the centre early on  Black is already feeling the consequences in the form of constricted and inadequate development.
255,9,8,Ng6,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p1n1/3pP3/3P4/3B3N/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black has taken two moves to develop his knight 'not good!' and by doing this he can't really say he's achieved a grat lot in doing this. However this knight move givesway to the development of the darksquared bishop. which by the way isn't very immpressive when it comes to pass. You will see that Black's neglect of the centre is brought home to him after everymove.
256,9,9,f4,b'rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p1n1/3pP3/3P1P2/3B3N/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq f3',!White intends to use the f-file for attacking purposes. This is accomplished by advancing the pawn twice to f5 leading to the opening of the file.
257,9,10,Be7,b'rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p1n1/3pP3/3P1P2/3B3N/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Oh wow simply stunning move that was really worth the wait definately worth moving the knight twice!  Black really has the advantage because of that now. Lol! Only joking.
258,9,11,f5,b'rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p1n1/3pPP2/3P4/3B3N/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',! Now from looking at the board you can see that an exchange of pawns is going to take place now one way or another. Pawn captures in chess are the most frequent cause of line opening in chess and everybody knows or atleast will know now is that line opening leads to attacking possibilities. The play that follows gives a masterclass of how to build up an attack on an open file. Looking back for a moment on the early opening play we see how accurately Morphy appraised chances of openingthe f-file 4.Nh3!. You will start to see now why  4.Nh3! deserves an exclamation mark if not more than just the one!
259,9,12,1Nc3,b'rnq1k2r/p1p1bppp/1p4n1/3pP3/3P4/2N4N/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Morphyb agaqin attacks with gain of time by also attacking the d5 pawn. Note how White develops with free-and-easy moveswhich are most effective.Black on the otherhand has to resort to tortuous maneuvers which really accomplish almost nothing. In one sense Black has already lost because of his lack of development and because he will not be able to make up for this later on.
260,9,13,1Qh5,b'rnq2rk1/p3nppp/1pp5/3pP2Q/3P4/2N4N/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',! Morphy plays his queen to its most aggressive post with a direct menace to Black's castled position. The more I study this position the more dangerous the more and more threatening White's formation appears.
261,9,14,1h6,b'rnq2rk1/p3npp1/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P4/2N4N/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - -',This is played to preven 15.Ng5. he does not have much choice. Any other moveputs him an even worse postion than he stands now and that is pretty bad!
262,9,15,1Rf3,b'rnq2rk1/p3npp1/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P4/2N2R1N/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',! Morphy prepares to increase the pressure on the open f-file by doubling his rooks on it.
263,9,16,1Ng6,b'rnq2rk1/p4pp1/1pp3np/3pP2Q/3P4/2N2R1N/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',This move takes some pressure of the f-pawn as it blocks the attack on it by the white Quee.
264,9,17,1Raf1,b'rnq2rk1/p4pp1/1pp3np/3pP2Q/3P4/2N2R1N/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',! Doubling his rooks getting ready to go for the kill.
265,9,18,1Qe6,b'rn3rk1/p4pp1/1pp1q1np/3pP2Q/3P4/2N2R1N/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Both sides have assembled in force on the King-side. White has a distinct advantagebecause both of his Rooks are in the attack whereas Black has the services of only one of his Rooks for defencive purposes. However Black is just about safe for the moment in other words White's attack needs new power. But where can Morphy conjure this power nearly all his pieces are involved in the attack. Most players would probably play 17.Nf4 here. But Morphy's method is much more magical:n to carry out his logical exchange he transfers his currently inactive Knight on c3 to the King-side. remarkable logical play!
266,9,19,1Ne2,b'rn3rk1/p4pp1/1pp1q1np/3pP2Q/3P4/5R1N/PPP1N1PP/5RK1 b - -',! This is the start of the Knight's journey.
267,9,20,1Nd7,b'r4rk1/p2n1pp1/1pp1q1np/3pP2Q/3P4/5R1N/PPP1N1PP/5RK1 w - -',Black develops a new piece but alas this move ahs the curse the fatal drawback of all blacks developing moves; his failure to control anypart of the centre has deemed his developing move absolutely useless!
268,9,21,Qe7,b'r4rk1/p2nqpp1/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P1N2/5R2/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',Now we see the effect of Morphy's cleverly executed exchange maneuver whites kinside force has been increased  Black's protective knight has evaporated and his King's position is stripped bare against a powerful attack. 
269,9,22,2Rg3,b'r4rk1/p2nqpp1/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P1N2/6R1/PPP3PP/5RK1 b - -',With Black's protective Knight gone this threatens 21.Qxh6
270,9,23,2Kh7,b'r4r2/p2nqppk/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P1N2/6R1/PPP3PP/5RK1 w - -',This parries the threat.
271,9,24,2Rff3,b'r4r2/p2nqppk/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P1N2/5RR1/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',Morphy's superior mobility has the fantastiv quality that one infiltration leads to another.
272,9,25,2Rfg8,b'r5r1/p2nqppk/1pp4p/3pP2Q/3P1N2/5RR1/PPP3PP/6K1 w - -',He tries to avoid the weakening of the King's positionthat results from 21...g6
273,9,26,2Ng5+,b'r5r1/p2nqp1k/1pp3pp/3pP1NQ/3P4/5RR1/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',!
274,9,27,2Qxg5,b'r5r1/p2n1p1k/1pp3pp/3pP1qQ/3P4/5RR1/PPP3PP/6K1 w - -',Now the  pawn weaknesses of the castled position take their toll.
275,9,28,2Rxg5,b'r5r1/p2n1p1k/1pp3pp/3pP1RQ/3P4/5R2/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',Black's Queen is gone and everything but the game is gone too.
276,9,29,2Qxh6#,b'r5rk/p2n1p2/1pp3pQ/3pP1R1/3P4/5R2/PPP3PP/6K1 b - -',"This game is a wonderful object in the eploitation of the difficulties arrising from the neglect of the centre. Morphy's utilisation of thye f-file is striking in its simplicity; but even more immpressive is the fact that the whole attack powerful as it wis stems from the basic strategem of opening a line of attack by means of a Pawn exchange. If ever you get to play Paul Morphy in some other life for God's sake don't neglect the centre!What a game! I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why.
Thanks

An important insurance move for Black conceived on move 9 for upon b5-a6x Black's white square bishop threatens a nasty pin and Black has the a-file all to himself. Anything else and Black can castle Queen side without ever having to worry about a pawn storm from White -- his pawn structure is impervious and White's b-pawn is blocking a6 (even White's knights cannot land there). This move seems to guarantee Black's future.

289,10,12,Ned5,b'2kr3r/1bpq1Qb1/1p1p1n2/pP1n1ppp/P2P4/2NNP2P/2PB1PP1/R4RK1 w - -',! Forcing an exchange of queens only good for Black here

412,11,107,6fxe5,b'8/4q1kp/p5p1/3Qp3/8/5NP1/6KP/8 w - -',he takes the bait!
413,11,108,6Qxe5+,b'8/4q1kp/p5p1/4Q3/8/5NP1/6KP/8 b - -',now he's forced to trade queens!
414,11,109,6Qxe5,b'8/6kp/p5p1/4q3/8/5NP1/6KP/8 w - -',and has to do it
415,11,110,6Nxe5,b'8/6kp/p5p1/4N3/8/6P1/6KP/8 b - -',now I just need to get my knight to the a-file!

419,11,114,7Kf3,b'8/7p/p3k1p1/8/2N5/5KP1/7P/8 b - -',I bring my king over too
420,11,115,7Kd5,b'8/7p/p5p1/3k4/2N5/5KP1/7P/8 w - -',he keeps coming
421,11,116,7Nb2,b'8/7p/p5p1/3k4/8/5KP1/1N5P/8 b - -',I head for the corner
422,11,117,7a5,b'8/7p/6p1/p2k4/8/5KP1/1N5P/8 w - -',probably a mistake.. he should have tried to block my king with Kd4
423,11,118,7Kf4,b'8/7p/6p1/p2k4/5K2/6P1/1N5P/8 b - -',I decide the knight can handle it and head for the other two pawns
424,11,119,7h6,b'8/8/6pp/p2k4/5K2/6P1/1N5P/8 w - -',he prevents my king from coming closer to them

426,11,121,7Ke6,b'8/8/4k1pp/p7/5KP1/8/1N5P/8 w - -',he goes back to protect
427,11,122,7g5,b'8/8/4k1pp/p5P1/5K2/8/1N5P/8 b - -',this is probably a bad move by me... I think h4 would have been better
428,11,123,7h5,b'8/8/4k1p1/p5Pp/5K2/8/1N5P/8 w - -',he wants to keep the pawns
429,11,124,7h4,b'8/8/4k1p1/p5Pp/5K1P/8/1N6/8 b - h3',I lock them up
430,11,125,7Kd5,b'8/8/6p1/p2k2Pp/5K1P/8/1N6/8 w - -',he heads back for the a-file
431,11,126,7Na4,b'8/8/6p1/p2k2Pp/N4K1P/8/8/8 b - -',I make sure his only move will be the King
432,11,127,7Ke6,b'8/8/4k1p1/p5Pp/N4K1P/8/8/8 w - -',he changes directions again (and that is a big mistake Kd6 or Kd4 are better)
433,11,128,7Ke4,b'8/8/4k1p1/p5Pp/N3K2P/8/8/8 b - -',now his King gave me an opening 
434,11,129,7Kd6,b'8/8/3k2p1/p5Pp/N3K2P/8/8/8 w - -',his best bet
435,11,130,7Nc3,b'8/8/3k2p1/p5Pp/4K2P/2N5/8/8 b - -',my king is close enough to stop the a-pawn so I'll send the knight to the other flank
436,11,131,7Ke6,b'8/8/4k1p1/p5Pp/4K2P/2N5/8/8 w - -',I expected Kc5
437,11,132,8Nb5,b'8/8/4k1p1/pN4Pp/4K2P/8/8/8 b - -',this will force the king back to the 7th rank
438,11,133,8a4,b'8/8/4k1p1/1N4Pp/p3K2P/8/8/8 w - -',he moves the pawn instead!
439,11,134,8Nc7+,b'8/2N5/4k1p1/6Pp/p3K2P/8/8/8 b - -',I want the king to move away from the pawns before my kig goes after the a-pawn
440,11,135,8Kd6,b'8/2N5/3k2p1/6Pp/p3K2P/8/8/8 w - -',he comes at the knight
441,11,136,8Nd5,b'8/8/3k2p1/3N2Pp/p3K2P/8/8/8 b - -',I go to the king for protection
442,11,137,8a3,b'8/8/3k2p1/3N2Pp/4K2P/p7/8/8 w - -',he makes a run for it
443,11,138,8Nc3,b'8/8/3k2p1/6Pp/4K2P/p1N5/8/8 b - -',this will slow him down!
444,11,139,8Ke6,b'8/8/4k1p1/6Pp/4K2P/p1N5/8/8 w - -',I think he's willing to give up the a-pawn to save the others
445,11,140,8Kf4,b'8/8/4k1p1/6Pp/5K1P/p1N5/8/8 b - -',just a stalling move
446,11,141,8Kd6,b'8/8/3k2p1/6Pp/5K1P/p1N5/8/8 w - -',a bad move.....
447,11,142,8Nb5+,b'8/8/3k2p1/1N4Pp/5K1P/p7/8/8 b - -',he falls into a knight fork. The a-pawn is lost and without the a-pawn to distract the knight he resigns
448,12,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',More common is 1.e4 
449,12,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Black replies symetrically also staking a claim for the centre.
450,12,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"?! From a theoretical point of view White's last move has certain advanatges and disadvantages. I think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Now white can develop his King's Bishop. Thi is a big factor in this game as this bishop plays a large role in whites coming attacking plans. This move however blocks the development of whites queen bishop. This is the ""Stonwall's Bad Bishop""
Incidently in reaching the desired pawn pattern it is essential for white to play his moves in the proper sequence as indicated in this game. This has now become harder for white and has now seen the 'Stonewall attack' see little action even in club or internet games let alone master games!"
451,12,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is a standard developing move which has the merit of controlling e4  and also prepares for castling. The alternative move here is 2..Bf5 which also controls e4 but leads to a totally different pattern.
452,12,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This is one of whites key moves in his desired opening pattern. This move develops a move prepares for castling sets the bishop up on a strong attacking diagonal aiming at blacks prospective castled position and disputes control of the e4. As we shall see from whites next move it is of utmost importance for him to have the the d4square in his power.
453,12,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black follows suit preparing to develop his King Bishop.
454,12,6,Nd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',! White intends to play f4 one of the characteristic moves of the 'Stonewall' pattern. once he has played that move black can play ...Ne4 with out inccuring any danger of having it driven it away by f3. therefore before playing f4 white first plays out his Queen Knight to prevent  ..Ne4. I decided to give this move a ! becuase it is a clever thinking ahead move.
455,12,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq c6',This is a good move theoretically as it engages whites d4 pawn and therefore minimizes somewhat white's pressure on e4. White can't reply with 5. dxc5 as that would relax his grip on the valuable square e4. In this opening control of the centre is absolutely paramount. Now there is a threatof ...c4 driving White's Bishop off the powerful attacking diagonal.
456,12,8,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This is another characteristic move of the stonewall pattern. White supports d4 and also creates a retreat for the Bishop along the powerful attacking diagonal in the event of the move i talked about earlier ...c4.
457,12,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This is another useful develping move Black threatens if permitted to play ..e5with complete freedomand the intiative. In this we encounter a sharp tempo in the struggle for control of the centre. Where black develops systematically there is a tense fight for the control of centre from the very beginning. At this point the fight for the centre must absorb both of the players thoughts. One negligent move could give the other player the intiative. In the event of 5...c4 trying to drive whites light squared bishop of that powerful attacking diagonal white will not oblige by reacting passively with 6.Be2 when the bishop is left out of the attack with no aggressive prospects Instead white will play 6. Bc2! so that his Bishop exerpts precisely the same aggressive effect as from d3.
458,12,10,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',?! This move completes the stonewall pattern ..e5 is permanently prevented and white prepares to anchor his King Knight at the powerful outpost on e5. Here the Knight wil exert commanding influence on the enemys' terrain. The idea behind the 'Stonewall' is to keep the centre blocked and launch an attack on the wing. As you can see it is a fairly rigid pawn formation which can often leave little room for the pieces to operate. The e5 square is whites only central invasion point. This opening 'system' ( I say system because it can be played by both sides) is more popular with inexperienced players becasue they can be fairly certain that they're moving their pieces to their proper squares.  I think this is the wrong way to learn chess as it does not teach you to think. I think you should learn more flexible opening.
459,12,11,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',This deve;ops a piece and prepares castling. This is slightly passive I would recomend 6...Bd6 with no attacking prospects but being able to defend or exchange the oncoming White Knight to e5. Now you will se how the stonewall pattern got its name!
460,12,12,Ngf3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The knight starts its journey to the formidable outpost of e5. 
461,12,13,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black thinks he is getting his king into safety where he can then hope to develop his pieces and eventually attack whites formidable pawn formation. You will see this is the wrong choice because black has actually castled on the wing where all the action is going to take place. I think it would be a better plan for black to continue developing is pieces and castle queenside then pawnstorm the kingside .

Once Black's Queen Bishop is developed he can start thinking of finding the most favourable squares for the placement of his rooks.
We cn now ask ourselves the question; What is White's plan in the middlegame? This requires a careful assesment of the position. Material is even in. In development Black seems to have a slight advantage; he has castled moved his queen and is on the point of developing his Queen Bishop. White lags in most of these details. However White as you will see make up for his la in development. I conlude that white has better prospects. WHY? Whereas Black has not posted one man beyond the fifth rank White's King Knight is powerfully placed at e5 well supported by two pawns. This factor alone is enough to outweigh any element which is at the moment in Black's favour.
But there is another poin: Whites Bishop at d3 is aimed directly at Black's castled position. Black can't block the attacking diagonal by ...Ne4. Therefore Whites basic plan us to aim for attack.

You may say that castling the same side that you prepare to pawnstorm is quite risky.hoever if white takes time to develop his Queenside pieces then castle Queenside then pawnstorm the Kingside Black will already of organized his forces to defend his King and may well be in the midst of attacking White's King!
465,12,17,b6,b'r1b2rk1/p1q1bppp/1pn1pn2/2ppN3/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',"White has some alternatives wich are not satisfactory.
If 9...cxd4 then 10. exc4 opening the diagonal for white's Queen Bishop which can then move  as soon as the Knight on d2 has moved. Another point in White's favour is the opening of the e-file for his Rooks. As the move 9...cxd4 gives Black no compensation advantage the move must therefore be out of the question.
Secondly if 9...c4 as has already been pointed out the bishop can just retreat to c2 remaining on the powerful attacking diagonal still aimed at Black's castled King! Also Whites grip on the centre is extremely strong and he surely will benefit from black stopping the posibility of exchanging pawns in the centre or maintaining the tension.
Thirdly is 9...NxN then 10.fxe5. At first sight you can be forgiven for thinking this idea is attractive as it rids Black of a piece which is bound to be a thorn in his side. But the answer is still negative. After 9...NxN 10.fxe5 with the result that the f-file is opened for white. The power of Whites King Rook would be enhanced x1000 another equally convincing arguement that after 9...NxN 10.fxe5 Black's valuable protective Knight is driven away from f6. The result is the attack by White's d3 Bishop on h7 becomes more and more powerful!
I think that arguement just about rules out any other move no?

His basic idea is obviously to drive away Black's Knight on f6 from its key defencive post. Thereby building pressure on h7. Another reason for this move is after the pawn advance g4-g5 there are often the opportunities to exchange it. Pawn advances result in open lines. In this case this exchange of the pawn would give White the new line of attack the open g-file.

A moment ago I said that 9...NxN would be bad. Now I claim that this this move would be good. What has happened to change my mind. The point is thi8s: After 11...NxN; 12.fxe5 Black would be able (after10...Bb7) to play 12...Ne4! establishing and maintaining an outpost os his own. whites attacking plans would be permanently disrupted as the attacking diagonal of his Bishop at d3 would be completely neutralized.
N.B- Black's hope of killing the attack is contingent withon getting the upperhand in the centre (12...Ne4); and this in turn is the result of 10...Bb7 a move which exerts pressureon the centre. And so it is a struggle for control of the centre which determines the success or failure of the attack!"

Is he waiting to see how White's plan unfolds? I think there is some reason behind blacks last move: The Kingside isabout as well-defended as it can be and a regrouping of his forceswould not improve his defenceve positon. Black therefore prepares a Queenside counter-attack. I think he plans to advance his Queenside pawns in the hope of opening a file in that sector and in that way diverting Whites attenton from the Kingside. This plan seems logical although theoretically the plan is harmless for White. For on the Kingside White attacks the Black king yet on the Queenside Black pursuesa purely positional objective which can't harm White's King. In fact White's attention now becomes so pressing that Black never gets any further with this intended pawn storm!

To summarise: White followed out his plan of attack consistently. He setb up his pieceswith a view to a direct attack on the Black King particularly on h7. First driving away Blacks Guardian Knight on f6 he concentrated his forces against the Black King sacrificing brilliantly in justifiable reliance on his ultimate success. An interesting feature of the unfolding of White's attack is the way his bottled up dark squared Bishop at last came to life and hammered out the final decision againtst Black's harried King. What a game! I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them.

It's easy to win if you have an opponent that knows nothing about this opening. But luckily I had played it much in OTB tournaments as black(and analyzed a little with some databases) so I knew that having your king in the center even with a piece up isn't very comfortable. White's idea is if I play 5. .. Nxd5 then he sacrifices a knight for a strong attack. 6.Nxf7 Kxf7 7.Qf3. If I play now 7. .. Ke8 then he retakes the knight 8.Bxd5 with a mate threat and has already taken the right to castle from me. If 7. .. Ke6 then he simply puts more pieces to attack to regain the material and perhaps create a mating net by developing his pieces with tempos for example Nc3. All the time black has to defend his knight on d5 as well as his king which is drinven out in the center of the board.

Instead he has a spare pawn while black has moved his queen more than once is starting to lose his advantage in development.

Luckily I was able to block his advance utilizing my piece advantage and some pretty good coordination of my forces.

Trust me when I tell you that I have played 10's of thousands of games in my life (including the ridiculous 6500 something here on GK). Of all of those games I would guess that only in a few hundred have I played 1...c5 vs. 1. e4. For those that know me I'm a Scandanavian player. I have realized (finally!) that I am entirely too predictable so I have put a few of my fears to rest and have started branching out some. To me the Sicilian has always represented some of the most scary (yet oddly thrilling) aspects of playing with the black pieces. There are just too many variations that can arise and I have always tried to steer towards more simple straight-forward opening lines. In doing some reading (and also going through some great annotations right here on GK) I have decided to tackle the Najdorf. Hopefully with some practice I can safely add it to my repitoire and not feel suicidal in doing so.......

I can only assume that white feared my strong central pawns that would easily be reinforced by my big artillery so he sacs his knight to remove them. I began thinking that this was a huge mistake on my opponent's part. Then I realized that if he could somehow negate my control of c4 I could have some serious problems due to his 3-1 pawn majority. This going to be a very interesting endgame!

I rationalized that every time I took heat off of c3 so could he. I debated and debated. I finally figured that the tiny material advantage I had may just be enough to win - but it would require my king to put on his gloves and get into the ring. If I didn't have my a pawn on the board I would not have considered this. I mentally took all four rooks and both queens off of the board. That would leave my bishop vs. his three pawns - which is a pretty equal fight. However his king could reach the action before me so the presence of my a pawn gave me the fortitude to attempt this trade down of material. Risky.....but exciting chess!

Black's attack never really gets off the ground (as he goes in for a dubious variation on the 20th move) and the position flirts with disaster for a long time and eventually he solves his immediate problems at the cost of simplifying into an excruciating endgame. White's handling of the position leaves a very strong impression.

Of course b3 is a great defensive square for the bishop but it is double-edged as the coming pawn storm on the queenside often targets this piece's lack of outpost squares. There are many alternatives.
Alternative variation: [ An interesting sideline is] 11. h4 [ (obviously not 11.g4? as examined previously)] b5 12. Bb3 a5 [ When White has to suck it up and play] 13. Ndxb5 [ (or else the b3 bishop is in serious trouble)] a4 14. Bxa4 [ with 2 pawns and a very sharp position e.g.] Qa5 15. h5 Ne5 16. hxg6 Bxb5 17. Bxb5 Rxb5 18. Nxb5 Qxa2 19. Nc3 Qa1  20. Nb1 Nc4 21. gxf7  Kh8 22. Qb4 Nd5 [ when White's head has exploded! Of course not all of that is forced and even in this position it is rather unclear but certainly White has to solve a lot of problems just to dispel Black's initiative and that is rarely fun for the first player.

Black can still play ... b5 and ..Nc4 but now he has other options that White must consider.

Alternative variation: [ Black can also continue more actively with] 11... b5 [but lately] 12. Nxc6 Bxc6 13. Bxa7 [has garnered much attention. It's hard to believe in this for White but it's basically a favorable variation of the 11. Nxc6?! idea.

While black has no weaknesses and white has only gotten one developing move he has VERY easy development (though white must choose the correct squares) and two nice files to use.
850,25,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A standard response there are any number of defenses for black and while white may not always have complete compensation he will get play and activity.

The idea behind this move is to block the highly dangerous a2-g8 diagonal.  The bishop is quite imposing on c4 and white's pieces can flood forward incredibly easily.  To give some sense of the dangers for black here's a quick line: 6... Nf6?! 7.e5! Nxe5?? 8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.Bxf7! wins black's queen.  e5 frequently leads to black getting in a very dangerous situation.
852,25,4,Qe2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',This is the main move for white and it's a key move to the opening.  The queen does a great job supporting the e5 push and this prepares Rd1! which exerts huge pressure against black's queen.
853,25,5,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Black is struggling to cope with all the attacking points white has.  b5 is frequently a great square for a bishop to check with or a knight to attack c7 or d6 from.  Black's development has come slowly but his positions is playable his pawn are defensive but they control good squares.  White needs to attack quickly or black will have time to complete development.  Thus white activates with threats as much as possible.
854,25,6,Rd1,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',This move brings the threat of e5! where the d pawn is pinned and white will back his pawn (he threatens to win d6) with a nice advantage.
855,25,7,Qc7,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1BR2K1 w kq -',Black must vacate the d file.  He has a few choices but it's hard to say that any are better than this.  After 9... Bd7 (which is decent move) black's d pawn grows weak because the queen doesn't defend it.  After 9... Qa5 white gains time with a standard maneuver of a3 and b4 which gives white a nice space advantage EVERYWHERE on the board.  White is still successful in forcing black to respond to threats white is amost fully developed and black has not yet castled.
856,25,8,1Bf4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',White brings the bishop to it's best square not only does it eye black's queen but it prepares the powerful e5.
857,25,9,1e5,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',This is a bad move (the developing 10... Be7 is stronger) but at this point white's dark squared bishop looks very dangerous and the Bc4 is not so threatening (so now the pawn isn't needed on e6 to close down the diagonal) while this seems natural (and is sometimes very good) it has a huge drawback.  Namely the d5 square has been given to white's pieces.
858,25,10,1Nd5,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1np1n2/3Np3/2B1PB2/5N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',Definitely the most powerful response.  If white's bishop retreats then black's weakening move will be justified.  This takes advantage of the new weakness.

862,25,14,1Nxe5,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq1nppp/p2p4/3PN3/2B2B2/8/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',Of course!  White has no desire to retreatin the smith-morra when he doesn't have to and after this move white's got a huge advantage.  Black cannot risk taking as after 13... dxe5 14.d6! comes like a hammerblow.
863,25,15,1f6,b'r1b1kb1r/1pq1n1pp/p2p1p2/3PN3/2B2B2/8/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',Now black is threatening to take white's knight.  This time (sadly) white is forced to retreat.  But white is up material and his pieces still dominate the board.
864,25,16,b5,b'r1b1kb1r/2q1n1pp/p2p1p2/1p1P4/2B2B2/5N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w kq b6',Black hopes to activate and he's playing his strongest moves... but white can play simple retreating moves now and retain his advantage.

869,25,21,1d6+,b'r1bq1b1r/4nkpp/p1RP1p2/1p6/8/1B3N2/PP2QPPP/3R2K1 b - -',And white strikes forward.
870,25,22,2Rc7,b'r1b1kb1r/2R1q1pp/p4p2/1p6/8/1B3N2/PP2QPPP/3R2K1 b - -',"21.Rc7!! A fitting consclusion after 21... Qxe2 white has 22.Bf7#!

Why did white win?  He had space but it was mostly quick and strong development that won the game.  Black grew too afraid of one threat and allowed white to explode forwards (11.Nd5!).  They say that a developmental advantage is fleeting and it must be used immediately.  But also when used well it's one of the most permanent advantages in chess.  As long as no moves are wasted the player with the advantage will ALWAYS have an extra move or two to carry out whatever plan they might have.  White had an initial time advantage and he kept it making it greater and greater.  In this final position black has one piece off the back row!  This was the purpose of the gambit to play for the win by having more time and space to do whatever white wanted.  It also shows the great danger for black around the central squares d5 and e5 (and later when the d pawn charged forward d6).  I hope you enjoyed the game please comment if you have thoughts criticisms or compliments.  I am always up for a game if someone want's to take my smith-morra gambit."

With Blacks knight covering e5 and my White squared bishop blocking the kings escape it would make sense and give the sack a purpose.
however i was always thinking about black playing g5 and would have preferred blacks king on the g file rather than the h file meaning that g5 isn't an option.)

Kd5. but then i can start moving my pawn 49. g5 and forcing the king to return thus me getting the knight. but i was only fearing to defend and safe pawn instead of attacking. not focus. 
1013,29,45,Ke5,b'8/8/p1p5/P1P1k3/2P3P1/2n1K2P/8/8 w - -',a very good move by black. this prevents white king to go to the back rank.
1014,29,46,Nxc5,b'8/8/p1p5/P1n1k3/2P3PP/5K2/8/8 w - -',another pawn is down. my chances are just with the g and h pawn. however it's harder as the black king is in a good position to prevent white king defending it's pawns.
1015,29,47,5g5,b'8/8/p1p5/P1n1k1P1/2P4P/5K2/8/8 b - -',but then i've got an idea. let black king go as far right as possible while i'm taking it's pawns (and horse if possible on the left).

1018,29,50,6Kb6,b'8/2n5/pKp5/6P1/2P4k/8/8/8 b - -',gotcha. moving knight will lose a6. moving anything else will lose c6.  note: i can't take knight as it will set loose the a pawn.
1019,29,51,6Kb6,b'8/2n5/pK6/5k2/2P5/8/8/8 b - -',still cannot take knight. but now attacking with c pawn as it is closer to the back row. when it's close enough then i can take the knight. and have the pawn race. but mine is closer. and the black king is too far. i'm pretty sure black had some winning chances as well but that's what playing more than 5 games with 3 days per move can make to your game. unless you stay focused on every move.
1020,29,52,6Kxc7,b'8/2K5/p3k3/2P5/8/8/8/8 b - -',i'm winning (please comment if i'm wrong). black is lost by time run out not retired. however even if black only move it's pawn i still win one move checking it's king first. moving black king wil mean white pawn is even ahead and just by moving white king to b7 will protect it's way for a promotion.
