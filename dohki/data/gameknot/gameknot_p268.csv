0,0,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',The English Opening. I wanted to try something different from my usual 1.e4
1,0,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And an unusual reply! This is the Caro-Kann Defense usual played after 1. e4 but not unknown as a response to the English. Jun Zhao played it twice with Black in the Asia Championship in 2007 and drew both games after 17 and 8 moves!
2,0,2,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p5/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Another unusal choice taking us away from the English and into the Dutch. 
3,0,3,Na6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/n1p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A complete novelty as far as I'm aware. This position hasn't been played much except by Darko Anic an IM who always plays 4. ... g6.
4,0,4,g3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/n1p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue to play the position as if it is the English/Reti with the king side secure in the fianchetto position and looking to attack on the queen side.
5,0,5,a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1pb1pp/n1p1pn2/5p2/2PP4/P1N2NP1/1P2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This may look like a defensive move preventing the bishop or knight from coming to b4. Instead it prepares b4 and the first pawn storm on the queen side.
6,0,6,Rb1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/n1pppn2/5p2/2PP4/P1N2NP1/1P2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',It is possible - and gm_dursley expected me - to play 9.b4 here. But I always prefer to finish my development first before launching my attack. 
7,0,7,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bb1pp/n1pppn2/5p2/2PP4/P1N2NP1/1P2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',Black's a7 knight is now out of position. Na6 is usually played aiming for c7 or to support a c5 pawn thrust. With this in mind I think I would have played 9. ... c5 looking to counter the queen side attack with gaining control of the centre. Black is short of space and sooner rather than later he needs to open the cage door.
8,0,8,Be8,b'r2qbrk1/pp2b1pp/n1pppn2/5p2/2PP4/P1NQ1NP1/1P2PPBP/1RB2RK1 w - -',Aiming for g6. Once again I would have been more worried about the knight and would have played Nc7. 
9,0,9,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/n1pppnb1/5p2/1PPP1B2/P1NQ1NP1/4PPBP/1R3RK1 b - b3',With my pieces in position the time has come to storm the queen side.

11,0,11,Nc7,b'r2q1rk1/ppn1b1pp/2ppp1b1/5p1n/1PPP4/P1NQ1NP1/3BPPBP/1R3RK1 w - -',:)

13,0,13,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/ppn1b1pp/2ppp1b1/5p1n/1PPP4/P1NQ1NP1/1R1BPPBP/5RK1 w - -',Contesting the queen side via a6 or b6 looks more natural at this stage. 
14,0,14,1a4,b'1r1q1rk1/ppn1b1pp/2ppp1b1/5p1n/PPPP4/2NQ1NP1/1R1BPPBP/5RK1 b - -',Four little Dickie-birds all in a row.... and preparing the b5 thrust.

17,0,17,1Qd7,b'1r3rk1/ppnqb1pp/2ppp1b1/7n/PPPPPp2/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PBP/5RK1 w - -',I expected and probably would have played fxe3 e.p. Why let me have five pawns in a row?

20,0,20,1Rfb1,b'1r2qrk1/ppn1b1pp/2ppp1b1/1P5n/P1PPPp2/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PBP/1R4K1 b - -',Already the position is looking bad for Black. There is no way for him to find counter play now either in the centre or on the king side.
21,0,21,1bxc6,b'1r2qrk1/p1n1b1pp/1pPpp1b1/7n/P1PPPp2/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PBP/1R4K1 b - -',And finally..... the first piece is taken after 19 moves! Most unusual in modern chess. 
22,0,22,2a5,b'1r3rk1/p1n1b1pp/1pqpp1b1/P6n/2PPPp2/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PBP/1R4K1 b - -',Another possible push was d5 here but I didn't want to touch the centre in case gm_dursley found a way to gain some initiative. 
23,0,23,2fxg3,b'1r3rk1/p1n1b1pp/1pqpp1b1/P6n/2PPP3/2NQ1Np1/1R1B1PBP/1R4K1 w - -',This move serves no purpose. The only possible reply was e5 looking to break open the centre. 
24,0,24,Bd8,b'1r1b1rk1/p1n3pp/1pqpp1b1/P6n/2PPP3/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PB1/1R4K1 w - -',Another move without purpose but what else was possible? Maybe Nf6 or Rb7 looking to double his own rooks. Another good choice is Qb7 making White's d5 push less threatening. 
25,0,25,exd5,b'1r1b1rk1/p1n3pp/1pqp2b1/P2p3n/2P1P3/2NQ1NP1/1R1B1PB1/1R4K1 w - -',I would have left it alone and played the queen to d7 or e8. 
26,0,26,2Nd4,b'1r1b1rk1/p1nq2pp/1p1p2b1/P2P3n/3NP3/2NQ2P1/1R1B1PB1/1R4K1 b - -',Bringing another piece into the attack. The same can be achieved by playing Be3 but that outpost on c6 just looked too good to resist.
27,0,27,2Nc6,b'1r3rk1/p1nq2pp/1pNp1bb1/P2P3n/4P3/2NQ2P1/1R1B1PB1/1R4K1 b - -',The knight cannot be easily dislodged. In fact it remains here for the remainder of the game. 
28,0,28,2Rba8,b'r4rk1/p1nq2pp/1pNp1bb1/P2P3n/4P3/2NQ2P1/1R1B1PB1/1R4K1 w - -',Retreating into the corner is not ideal here. Rbe8 looks better and offers some hope of countering.
29,0,29,Qf7,b'r4rk1/2n2qpp/1RNp1bb1/3P3n/4P3/2NQ2P1/3B1PB1/1R4K1 w - -',I would have played Ra3 pinning the knight to the queen hoping to complicate things slightly. 
30,0,30,2f4,b'r4rk1/2n2qpp/1RNp1bb1/3P3n/4PP2/2NQ2P1/3B2B1/1R4K1 b - f3',Playing Qf7 brought my eyes back to the queen side where I noticed Black's knight and bishops all short of space. I realised that I could take advantage of this by playing f4 f5 and g4!
31,0,31,2Qd7,b'r4rk1/2nq2pp/1RNp1bb1/3P3n/4PP2/2NQ2P1/3B2B1/1R4K1 w - -',Serves no purpose. h6 was probably needed or once again Ra3.
32,0,32,3g5,b'r4rk1/2nq1bpp/1RNp1n2/3P1PP1/4P3/2Q5/3B2B1/1R4K1 b - -',It seemed natural at this stage to continue pushing the pawn. Bringing the bishop into play via Bg5 was another option.
33,0,33,3Nh5,b'r4rk1/2nq1bpp/1RNp4/3P1PPn/4P3/2Q5/3B2B1/1R4K1 w - -',Black's position is now hopeless.
34,0,34,3Rb6b7,b'r4rk1/1Rnq1bpp/2Np4/3P1PPn/4P3/2Q5/3B2B1/1R4K1 b - -',My opponent went off-line at this stage and I'd entered 33.f6 as my conditional move. However as I had no other moves to make in other games I remained on this board and played on to find that 33.f6 gxf6 34.gxf6 Qg4! was maybe not as clear. So I decided to keep things simple and I switched my attentions to Rb7 pinning the knight. In fact this is the winning move as the knight is now lost. The queen can't retreat to d8 and e7 which are covered by the knight and she can't go to c8 due to Ne7 . If she retreats to e8 the only other available square the knight falls immediately.  
35,0,35,3Bh3,b'5rk1/1Rnq1bpp/2Np4/3P1PPn/4P3/2Q4B/r2B4/1R4K1 b - -',Putting the queen under more pressure.
36,0,36,3Qxd2,b'5rk1/1Rnq1bpp/2Np4/3P1PPn/4P3/7B/3Q4/1R4K1 b - -',"And gm_dursley resigned. A possible continuation is 35. ... Re8 36.Qa5 Rc8 37.Rf1 Be8 38.Na7 Rd8 39.Rxc7 and black is 6 points down.

And so very interesting opening developments and the slow smothering of my opponent by 2 pawn storms well supported by all my pieces. "
37,1,0,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A Scotch game.
38,1,1,Qf6,b'r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2N2q2/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Avoids doubled pawns but somewhat exposes the queen.
39,1,2,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2q2n2/2b5/4P3/3B4/PPPQ1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',8. ... Nxe4?? 9.  Re1
40,1,3,Bd4,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2q2n2/8/1PPbP3/3B4/P2Q1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Makes use of the trapped rook and avoids a trapped bishop (a5 or either a6 save the bishop but it would be useless for quite some time).
41,1,4,Qxc3,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1PP1P3/2qB4/P4PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',!? Not sure that exchanging the queens is the best option but there we go...
42,1,5,b6,b'r1b2rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/8/1PP1P3/2NB4/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',There I was thinking about a Fianchetto but White would not cooperate.
43,1,6,1exd6,b'1rb1nrk1/p1p2ppp/1p1P4/8/1PP1BP2/2N5/P5PP/R4RK1 b - -',According to ChessMaster 19. Rad1 is better. The text move indeed permits Black to become less cramped and under less pressure.
44,1,7,2c5,b'1rb2rk1/p1p2ppp/1p1n4/2P5/1P2BP2/2N5/P5PP/R4RK1 b - -',?! This pawn move is maybe the loosing one for Black for he exchanges his remaining bishop for a Knight. In hindsight it proves costly in the double sided endgame that follows.
45,1,8,2b5,b'1r1r2k1/5ppp/1p6/pP6/P4P2/3b2N1/6PP/R2R2K1 b - -',Fix White pawns on squares that can be attacked by Black bishop. On the other hand Black pawns cannot be defended by the same bishop... 
46,1,9,Rb8,b'1r4k1/5ppp/1p6/pP6/P4P2/3b2N1/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',There I became afraid of Rc6. I guess that this move is not rational at this point and Black is reacting to invisible treat. Black should play more dynamically but what?
47,1,10,Be4,b'1r4k1/6pp/1p6/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N3/6PP/2R3K1 w - -',I thought I was being smart by preventing an approach road for the knight. I however forgot about Nc4...
48,1,11,Kf7,b'1r6/5kpp/1p6/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N3/6PP/3R2K1 w - -',Black is still seeing nothing.
49,1,12,3g3,b'1r6/5kpp/1p6/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N1P1/7P/3R2K1 b - -',Rd6 was better there.
50,1,13,3g6,b'1r6/5k1p/1p4p1/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N1P1/7P/3R2K1 w - -',Ke6 was better there.
51,1,14,3Rd6,b'1r6/5k1p/1p1R2p1/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N1P1/7P/6K1 b - -',A first piece attack the pawn.
52,1,15,3Ke7,b'1r6/4k2p/1p1R2p1/pP3p2/P3bP2/4N1P1/7P/6K1 w - -',There I again thought being smart by forcing the Rook to retreat.
53,1,16,3Nc4,b'1r6/4k2p/1p1R2p1/pP3p2/P1N1bP2/6P1/7P/6K1 b - -',Et hop... White has a double attack on the pawn and protect the rook at the same time. At this point I stopped and pushed (virtual) wood around. And then I saw it!
54,1,17,3Bc2,b'1r6/4k2p/1p1R2p1/pP3p2/P1N2P2/6P1/2b4P/6K1 w - -',"! I will put an exclamation mark because I'm quite proud of this move. Now I wasn't thinking very deep but just at something like: ""he takes one of my pawns I will take one of his. And if he doesn't Bb3 will come in handy."" It will prove to be more than that actually..."
55,1,18,3Nxb6,b'8/4k2p/1N4p1/pP3p2/P4P2/6P1/2b4P/6K1 b - -',The only way to get at a4 is to approach the king...
56,1,19,3Bb3,b'8/4k2p/1N4p1/pP3p2/P4P2/1b4P1/7P/6K1 w - -',! but there is better at hand: horse trapped!
57,1,20,3Ke3,b'3k4/7p/1N4p1/pP3p2/P4P2/1b2K1P1/7P/8 b - -',The post-analysis with ChessMaster just discovered that playing 38. Na8 would have saved the Knight (at the price of two pawns): 38. Na8 Kc8 39. b6! Bxa4 40. Nc7... ChessMaster deems 38. Ke3 to be the main factor behind White demise.
58,1,21,Bxa4,b'k7/7p/6p1/pPK2p2/b4P2/6P1/7P/8 w - -',ChessMaster considers this as a mistake and proposes b7 as the better alternative. Indeed it saves Black a-pawn and only delays Bxa4...
59,1,22,4Kd5,b'8/8/1k4pp/1P1K1p2/5P2/6P1/7P/3b4 b - -',There I had to think deeply about how to win. At first the win seems pretty easy: I'm up  one bishop for a pawn. Yet...
60,1,23,4g5,b'8/8/1k5p/1P1K1pp1/5P2/6P1/7P/3b4 w - -',! I didn't find any other move that wins for sure. In other lines Black may even ends up on the loosing side!
61,1,24,Kxb5,b'8/8/5K1p/1k3p2/5P2/8/2b4P/8 w - -',The key point: bring back the king to protect the f-pawn and free the bishop from this task so that it can be sacrificed.
62,1,25,Bd1,b'8/8/8/5pK1/4kP1P/8/8/3b4 w - -',And now White loses the f-pawn whatever he does and in the same stride ends up in a loosing pawn endgame.
63,1,26,Ke2,b'8/8/8/8/5p2/8/4k1K1/8 w - -',This is the first game I won against jongraft (and hopefully not the last)...
64,2,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Advance Variation is having a good time in the 21st century with the percentage of wins skewed in it's favour.
65,2,1,Nf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The Short Variation is one of the best lines for White in this system.
66,2,2,Nd7,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',5-c5 directly is also possible. However the move played is better.
67,2,3,Ne7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now the standard responses for White are 8.Nh4 8.Be3 and 8.dc. However White played...
68,2,4,Qb3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/1QP2N2/PP2BPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',I haven't seen this move before so I call it the 'Mano Attack' in honour of my opponent.
69,2,5,Nc6,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2n1p3/2ppPb2/3P4/NQP2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',The first mistake. I should have played 9 - a6 10.Nh4 - h5 with equality.
70,2,6,1Nb5,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2n1p3/1NppPb2/3P4/1QP2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Now White gets a slight edge.
71,2,7,1Re1,b'r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/1NppPb2/3P4/1QP2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq -',An inaccuracy. 11.Rd1 is correct retaining the small edge after 11 - cd 12.Nfd4. 
72,2,8,1Nd6+,b'r3kb1r/1p1n1ppp/pqnNp3/2ppP3/3P4/1QP1BB2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',A mistake which allows Black to simplify to an ending with a slight edge. 14.Na3!? was correct maintaining equality after 14 - Qb3 15.ab3.
73,2,9,1Bxd6,b'r3k2r/1p1n1ppp/pqnbp3/2ppP3/3P4/1QP1BB2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w kq -',Now Black has a slight edge.
74,2,10,1Rac1,b'r3k2r/1p3ppp/pn1Pp3/3p4/3P4/1P3B2/1P3PPP/2R1R1K1 b kq -',A good move disallowing long-castling and discouraging Kd7.
75,2,11,Rxe1+,b'8/1p1k1ppp/p2n4/3B4/8/1P6/1P3PPP/4rK2 w - -',My second mistake. I overestimated my chances in the ensuing Bishop vs. Knight endgame probably lulled by White's seemingly 'weak' doubled pawns. Correct was to retain the Rook and try to create a second weakness in White's position. In other words play on the Kingside. So 27 - Rc5 28.Rd1 - Ke7 29.Ke2 - g5 30.g3 - Kf6 retaining a slight edge was correct.
76,2,12,Kc7,b'8/1pk2ppp/p2n4/3B4/8/1P6/1P3PPP/4K3 w - -',My third mistake. Instead of going for the doubled pawns I ought to generate play on the K-side! Hence 28 - Ke7 29.Kd2 - b6 30.Ke3 - Kf6 with equality was correct.
77,2,13,Kc7,b'8/1pk2p2/p2n2p1/7p/1P1K3P/6P1/1P2BP2/8 w - -',A serious mistake. This attempt to prevent a Q-side infiltration only allows White fresh opportunities on the K-side. 36 - Kd7 was necessary when White would retain his slight edge after 37.Bd3 - Kd8 38.Kc5 - Kc7 39.Bc2 - b6  40.Kd4. 
78,2,14,3Ke5,b'8/1pk2p2/p2n2p1/4K2p/1P5P/6P1/1P2BP2/8 b - -',Now White's advantage is clear.
79,2,15,4Ke5,b'4nk2/1p3p2/p5p1/4K2p/1P3P1P/3B2P1/1P6/8 b - -',White has managed to drive Black to passivity thereby increasing his advantage.

81,2,17,4f5,b'4n3/1p2kp2/p5p1/4KP1p/1P5P/3B2P1/1P6/8 b - -',The decisive move breaking Black's K-side. Now there's no defense.
82,2,18,Nf6,b'8/1p2kp2/p4n2/5K1p/1P5P/3B2P1/1P6/8 w - -',"Here there were two other possibilities both of which however loses:

83,2,19,Ng7+,b'8/1p2kpn1/p7/5K1B/1P5P/6P1/1P6/8 w - -',45 - Nd6  loses to 46.Kg5 - Ne4  47.Kf4 - Nd6 48.Be2.
84,2,20,4Bd1,b'8/1p2kp2/p6K/8/1P1n3P/6P1/1P6/3B4 b - -',A clever ploy to restrict my Knight by sacrificing a Pawn.
85,2,21,4Nf5+,b'8/1p2kp2/p6K/5n2/1P5P/6P1/1P6/3B4 w - -',48 - b6 would lose to 49.h5 - Kf8 50.Kg5 - Kg7 51.h6 .
86,2,22,4Kg5,b'8/1p2kp2/p7/5nK1/1P5P/6P1/1P6/3B4 b - -',Not accepting the gift by 49 - Nd4 would lose to 50.Bg4 - Nc6 51.Bc8 - Nb4 52.Bb7.
87,2,23,5Kf4,b'8/4kp2/pp6/8/1P3K1P/5Bn1/1P6/8 b - -',I resigned the game here acknowledging the superiority of the Bishop over my Knight. However let's continue a bit further to see the winning mechanism of White.

While that is of course a great outpost for a black knight there might be no safe haven for black king in the future. The move played can also amount in a pawn sacrifice as the g5 pawn is going to be somewhat weak. But even if black loses a pawn white would lose some tempi in the hunt so the game is quite balanced IMO.

I guess I've been brainwashed by all those nasty examples of tempi-is-everything-in-open-sicilians but in my opinion Nf6-g4-f6 accomplishes nothing but opens the h-file for a rook a fact that is nullified by the next move.

A very versitle opening that tends to focus on solidifying the center and seeking out opprotunites to lauch flank attacks (at least the way I play it).  White still maintians the option of transposing to a queens gambit by playing c4 although the bishop will be misplaced for some QG variations and white should be very careful in making that decision.

I did state Saturday after the tournament that I'm begining to become frustrated with the sometimes stagnant and frankly uninspired games I've been getting out of this system lately.

The black Knight does take up a fine outpost but at this stage I was happy to ignore it and just develop with Qc2.  The idea being that I wanted to concentrate my efforts on e4 with a view to at some stage playing f3 and then e4.  Qc2 also has the advantage that it prevents black taking on c4 as the Knight is en prise.

However having played 18.e6 I now saw a way of surprising the black King (see move 20).  By playing 19.Nf2 I wanted to attack black's Queen and at the same time set a trap should black play 19...Nxf2.  If black plays 19...Qh5 (the only square) then white has a very dangerous discovered attack when he moves his bishop from g5.  One possible line is 19...Qh5 20. exf7  and if the black King moves to d8 or f8 the white can win the black Queen with the discovered attack referred to above.  The alternative move 20...Kd7 allows white to play 21.Qxd3 with check and a crushing attack.  Perhaps seeing this black chose 19.Nxf2 instead.

Ok giving this move an exclamation mark is a bit arrogant but I love this defence and I believe it is the best defence to e4. For those of you who haven't come across it before it is the Caro Kann (B10.) ""According to chessgames.com the stats are like this:
Number of games in database: 2093
Years covered: 1883 to 2008
Overall record:
   White wins 38.8%
   Black wins 24.1%
   Draws 37.1%""

Heres some background history on the caro-kann from everyman chess.
""The caro-kann is named after the two european masters Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann. Off the two Caro had the slightly more distinguished playing career having played in a number of strong tournaments around the year 1900. It is fair to say that if it wasn;t for there contribution to opening theory there names would have sunk without a trace within the annals of histopry. Individually they are totally forgettable but together they have achieved great fame. As raymond keene put it Caro and Kann has become as inseperable as Tweedledee and Tweedledum

This opening is introduced by the moves 1. e4 c6 and has long been one of black's ajor defences to 1. e4. The idea behind 1...c6 is to simplysupport the advance 2...d5 now if white captures on d5 black will be able to recapturewith the pawn maintaining an equal position in the centre. If plack had started 1...d5 then this would not have been posssibleand he would have to recapture with a piefe/ This (1...d5) is slightly less respectable Scandinavian Defence (otherwise known as the centre counter)

In chess there are two distinct approaches to playing the oepning with black. The first is to try and negate White's advantage of moving first through careful no nonsence play. The second more risky strategy is to counter-attack at once concentrating more on one's own ideas rather than what white is doing. The Caro-Kann is with the exception of one or two sidelines belongs firmly to the first group. it is an  opening that should appeal tot hose who like a solid st"

I don't know why because it is certainly not a mainline or one that is deemed very strong. I have been doing quite well against it. 

In the two knights variation of the caro-kann white will play Nf3 at some point in place of the usual d2-d4. 3.Nf3 isn't bad but it offers black a serious alternative to conceding the centre. "

b) 10... Bb4 is the old line that has been the subject of many heated theoretical battles over the yearsm After 11. h4! White usually ends up winning the bishop on g6 for a few pawns and the current view is that he gets slightly the better of an endgame I'm not sure about this but I don;t knwo much about t endagmes!

According to the Chess Opening Explorer database I use they have five games on their database with 5. gxf3 four ended in draws and one with a win for black. A couple of famous games between Fischer and Petrosian from the 1959 candidates tournament reached the position after 5.Qxf3 and 5....Nf6 and a later d4 by black was played instead of 5....e6 in both cases although on the database e6 is a much more commonly played move. One of the Fischer-Petrosian games ended in a draw and is annotated by Fischer in his book ""My 60 Memorable Games"" and the other ended in a win for Petrosian and is annotated by Edmar Mednis in his book ""How to Beat Bobby Fischer"". Both were exciting long hard-fought games and are worth looking up."""

Nothing to fear here really though.

The book move here is 7.Bd3 which is much stronger the continuation is 7... dxe4 8. Nxe4 Nbd7 9. 0-0 Nxe4 10. Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qh4 Nd5 and play seems equal with white having a minute advantage because of the bishop pair.

This is logical however unnecessary because the bishop pair is strong in open positions which this might become and this is not the best way of anticipating and reacting to the potential threat 10.Rd1 is much better and maybe then exchanging the bishop for that knight later if deemed necessary.

No this is not good at all castling on opposite sides leads a very sharp game with pawn storms on opposite flanks occur a lot. The side to get there attack in first normally wins. However I can't see white mounting a very swift pawn storm on my kingside castled position because of all the pieces blocking littleboo's pawns in.  I on the other hand have an un obstructed pawn on a7 which I can put into action quicky. Why Queen can also gain attacking positions very quickly on b6 or a5 immediately and my rooks when connected will make a powerful battery on the b-file. To conclude the best move here is 11. 0-0

The e file aint opening anytime soon Both rooks on a the central files can be good but not when all the play is going on on the wings and the centre is blocked and staying blocked! White should be trying to strike on the alternate flank to the castled king so moving a powerful piece from that flank is undesirable and shouldn't be done voluntarily. I would suggest something along the lines of 12. g4 Nd7 13. Bf4 is better. 

Charleshiggie points out here that there is another plan of counter-attack for white."

Therefore this move defends the pawns and is a good defencive move eevn though whites cahnies of getting more than a draw seem quite low here  but for a major blunder on my part.

I don't think 15. Bc1 (which is the only other realistic option here) is as strong because pieces serving pawns  is notoriously bad pawns should serve pieces if the former happened it causes passivity which isn't good when being attacked passive play can lead to zugzwang easily where there are no good moves or positions where black can't form a counter attack which is a very good form of defence surprisingly.

Charleshiggie left a comment and he thinks this move is a total waste of time. I agree with this he suggests moving his rook to d3 then to f3 where black will have to defend carefully or could end up in trouble because of the pinnedg7 pawn pinned ofcourse by littleboos queen on g3. This is what I call 'active defence' trying to find a solution to  a defencive problem by counter attacking. This can be effective and can turn your opponents thoughts away from his own attack.

He resigned here.

Thanks for the game littleboo. This game is the first caro-kann game I have ever annotated hopefully I've given you some good firsthand knowledge of the opening. In this game I encountered the ever increasing in popularity the two Knights defence variation. It's not a very theoretical line and is usually used as a surprise weapon to avoid more densely over analysed variation.

Most of the moves played at the beginning of this game seemed decent but 7.exd5 giving up the centre seemed poor givin up the bishop pair were a few mistakes but the cardinal would of been littleboo castling into my attack this isn't always bad like in many sicilian variations castling on opposite sides is common and attacks on either flanks are normally seen after but littleboo couldn't muster a quick and effective attack on the kingside after castling queenside so therefore he should of castled kingside. 

the main problem littleboo failed to address was when he was under pressure he failed to try and alleviate it with proper technique. He could of tried to use 'active defence' aka counter attacking to draw the attention away from ones king. Or he could of tried to solidify his position which was soon not possible  leaving counter attacking the only option. However littleboo did not play actively he tried to solidify his position when it was not possible which lead to passive play. Ofcourse I'm not saying the best form of defence is attack (or offence if your american!) but it is a viable option!

By the way I'd like to say thankyou for the comments by my  team captain charleshiggie who has left some useful ideas which I have added to the annotation. Thanks also for the kind comments from others who"

Qe5?? - an agressive looking move but I think it was the loser because I was trying to invade black's position with my queen and round up his queenside pawns from behind.  I think I should have played my king to h1 as the heavy pieces were still on the board but more importantly I would have gained a vital tempo by being able to back up the e pawn with my queen on f2 without the worry of it being pinned by a bishop check on e4 should that base be undermined.  But Freddy prevents this with Qc6!!!  I make things worse by dropping the queen back to e1 - another wasted move in 20/20 vision hindsight!!

It appears he has returned control to White with the loss of a pawn in the process. His Queenside pawns appear ragged and his Queen appears to be too enclosed to make an impact. He has yet to develop his King's Bishop which appeared to be part of his plan earlier. Has he lost the plot or is White bringing the game to Black?

Bishop is badly placed on h4 but then again white's king hinders the development of the f1 bishop. Also it has it's uses in some lines of restricting the king's movement to f2 g1.
653,30,1,d5,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3PPp1b/5N2/PPP1K1PP/RNBQ1B1R w kq d6',Developing light squared bishop. If exd5 then c6. White can't exactly afford to be greedy because his king is situated badly and is hindering the smooth development of his pieces.

The king can't move and the queen can't interpose the check on e3 because of the f4 pawn. Now the queen can get to e3 fine.
657,30,5,1g5,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1qp1p/8/6p1/3PnB1N/3Q4/PPP1K1PP/R4B1R w kq g6',Only move. Moving Nc5 no longer works due to Qe3. And Ng3 fails to Kf3 or Kd2 followed by Re1. Funny how attacking the king with Ng3 in this position simultaneously gains a tempo for white while losing a tempo for black and weakening his position by opening up the e-file.

And that the problem is finally rectified on move 24! But white has played good logical moves in my opinion and really he can't be faulted at all. Very illuminating though to the taxing effects of a displaced king early in the game.

672,31,6,d4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/3P4/1QP3PN/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - d3',This move prevents my 7 ... Be6 because 8 d5 would fork the bishop and knight while the pawn is protected by the bishop at g2 and the queen. I would end up losing a minor piece even if I tried to counter attack the queen with Na5. Qb5 would make sure of that.

As you can see my knight hasn't moved since I put it on the wall. Again weak spot for a knight they don't have many squares to move. And if the battle is at the other end of the board it takes at least 2 moves to get them somewhat close to the action.
716,31,50,3Re8,b'4rk2/p4pb1/1pp5/n6p/1P2Q1bP/2PB1pP1/P4K2/8 w - -',Nb7 was probably a better move losing the pawn at c6 to the queen and using another move to protect the knight again. But I had started visualizing a checkmate with my bishop on d4 and I needed the rook on the E file to do it. I decided that the knight might be expendable so I respond with a counter-attack. I could only hope things would work out since I gave up so much with my queen and I needed all the minor pieces I could keep.
717,31,51,Be5,b'4rk2/p4p2/1pp5/n3b2p/1P3QbP/2PB1pP1/P4K2/8 w - -',Thought that if I could move the queen a little that maybe I could save my knight afterall.

719,31,53,4bxa5,b'4r1k1/p4pb1/1ppQ4/P6p/6bP/2PB1pP1/P4K2/8 b - -',We'll see just how expendable that knight was.
720,31,54,4Bxc3,b'4r1k1/p4p2/1ppQ4/P6p/6bP/2bB1pP1/P4K2/8 w - -',Time to see if my checkmate could materialize. It would require my opponent not to see it though. Two bishops and a rook is a tough checkmate with a queen hanging around but with a well placed pawn sometimes good things can happen. I needed the pawn at c3 gone so that was first. Creating the threat on the a5 pawn was my diversion. My goal was to get the bishop on d4 with the queen unable to touch it.
721,31,55,axb6,b'4r1k1/5p2/1ppQ4/7p/6bP/2bB1pP1/P4K2/8 w - -',The trap is set. Encouraging the queen to take the c6 pawn which would also threaten my c3 bishop AND rook without my ability to protect them both!

728,32,2,Nxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2N5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My opponent really liked to trade for example if you go straight to move 16 you will already see that we reached an endgame position.
729,32,3,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The next several moves are a fight to control e5 which results in a lot of trading which is fine by me as it strengthens my position.

This is the kind of trading that my opponent did all game it strengthens my position while we remain equal in material.
731,32,5,Bxc3+,b'3rk2r/p2p1ppp/Q1p2q2/4p3/4P3/2b5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk -',Now I trade to weaken his pawn position for the endgame.
732,32,6,1Qxf6,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/5Q2/3pp3/8/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3K2R b KQk -',Another trade which helps me this time we remain equal in material when my opponent could have gained a pawn.
733,32,7,1Rd1,b'3rk2r/p4p1p/5p2/3pp3/8/2P5/P1P2PPP/3RK2R b Kk -',And now we reach an early endgame in which my pawn structure is greatly superior which will eventually win me the game.

741,32,15,3Kb6,b'8/5p2/1K2k3/8/3p3r/4p3/P1P1R2P/8 b - -',At this point my opponent assumed that it would now become a pawn race I suppose that it might have been if he had played it right or I had played it wrong or both.

744,32,18,3c3,b'1r6/8/8/3k1p2/P2p4/K1P1p3/4R2P/8 b - -',Once again my opponent assumed that I would take but by allowing him to take first I once again strengthened my position for the imminent pawn promotion.
745,32,19,f3,b'1r6/8/8/P7/3k4/K3pp2/4R2P/8 w - -',And the game is as good as over (if it wasn't a long time ago)!
