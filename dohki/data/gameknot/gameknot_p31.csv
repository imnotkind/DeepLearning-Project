0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Where did I play well and where was I blundering?  From what move was I better?  If at all.
1,0,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I was black and after whites move of e4 I went with d5 just to see what he would do I think.  I like to try things and its fun to make moves to get out of a situation but with 2 pawns not much damage here I think.
2,0,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So white never protected his pawn but pushed it up to e5 a bit previous ?  I also didn't protect but there was nothing attacking so I moved to c5.
3,0,3,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White moved pawn to d4 and I took with my c5 pawn.
4,0,4,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pPb2/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',White queen captured my pawn and is protecting e5 pawn.  I moved LB out to f5 attacking c2 and I maybe thought I might come out with my queen to b6 maybe.
5,0,5,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1B1pPb2/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',White moved LB to b5 and I brought out my knight to protect my king from check.  It is also attacking white's queen.
6,0,6,f6,b'r2qkbnr/pp2p1pp/2n2p2/1B1pPb2/3Q4/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Next white moved his knight to a3 protecting the LB  at b5.  I am unable to take white's queen with the pin from white's LB.  I moved to attack the pawn at e5 with f6.
7,0,7,gxf6,b'r2qkbnr/pp2p2p/2n2p2/1B1p1b2/3Q4/N7/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',White took my pawn at f6 and I retook with g7 pawn.
8,0,8,Qc7,b'r3kbnr/ppq1p2p/2n2p2/1B1p1b2/8/N1Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',White moved his queen back to c3 and I moved my queen to c7 to avoid taking the LB with my pawns should white take the knight at c6.
9,0,9,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/ppq1p2p/2n2p2/1B1p1b2/8/N1Q3P1/PPP2P1P/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',Now white moved his pawn on the g file to g3 while leaving his king sat in the middle of the board.  Better would have been to develop a piece to enable him to castle.  I castled on the queen side.
10,0,10,e5,b'2kr1bnr/ppq4p/2n2p2/1B1ppb2/5B2/N1Q3P1/PPP2P1P/R3K1NR w KQ e6',White developed his DB out to f4 so that was the plan with his previous move as he is now protected by the g3 pawn and is attacking my queen at c7.  I move my e pawn out to e5 to block the DB.
11,0,11,Nge7,b'2kr1b1r/ppq1n2p/2n2p2/1B1ppb2/8/N1Q3P1/PPPB1P1P/R3K1NR w KQ -',White retreats his DB back to d2 and I develop my knight to e7 and now the knights are working together.  The g file is now part open for my rook to move across to.
12,0,12,Nd4,b'2kr1b1r/ppq1n2p/5p2/1B1ppb2/3n4/N1Q3P1/PPPB1P1P/2KR2NR w - -',White now long castles and I move my c knight to d4 which leaves the queens facing each other on the c file and I am attacking the LB at b5.
13,0,13,Nec6,b'2kr1b1r/ppq4p/2n2p2/1B1ppb2/3n1B2/N1Q3P1/PPP2P1P/2KR2NR w - -',White moves the DB to f4 allowing the rook to get active if required.  My knights still protect each other with the move of my e7 knight to c6.
14,0,14,Qxc6,b'2kr1b1r/pp5p/2q2p2/3ppb2/3n1B2/N1Q3P1/PPP2P1P/2KR2NR w - -',Now white takes my c6 knight with the LB but I retake with my queen.
15,0,15,Nxc6,b'2kr1b1r/pp5p/2n2p2/3ppb2/5B2/N5P1/PPP2P1P/2KR2NR w - -',White captures my queen with his queen and I recapture with my d4 knight rather than a pawn.
16,0,16,Kb8,b'1k1r1b1r/pp5p/2n2p2/3ppb2/8/N3B1P1/PPP2P1P/2KR2NR w - -',White moves his DB to e3 attacking a7 square and I move my king over to b8 as my king would be in the open if the knight had to respond to the LB's attack.
17,0,17,d4,b'1k1r1b1r/pp5p/2n2p2/4pb2/3p1P2/N3B1P1/PPP4P/2KR2NR w - -',White pushes pawn out to f4 attacking my pawn at e5.  I push my d5 pawn to d4 attacking the DB and stopping his progress on the diagonal to a7 this pawn is protected by my knight at c6.  The rooks are also on the d file at d8 and d1.
18,0,18,Bd6,b'1k1r3r/pp5p/2nb1p2/4pb2/3p1P2/N5P1/PPP2B1P/2KR2NR w - -',White retreats the DB to f2 and I develop my bishop to d6 bringing it out to support the centre pawns.  This also allows the rooks now to work together.
19,0,19,fxe5,b'1k1r3r/pp5p/2nb4/4pb2/3p4/N5P1/PPP2B1P/2KR2NR w - -',White captures my pawn at e5 with d4 pawn and I recapture with my f6 pawn.  The e5 pawn is well protected with the knight at c6 and DB at d6.  My LB is hanging I must do something about that.
20,0,20,Bg4,b'1k1r3r/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/3p2b1/N4NP1/PPP2B1P/2KR3R w - -',White develops g knight to f3 and I immediately move my LB to g4 to attack it.  My LB still is hanging.
21,0,21,Bxf3,b'1k1r3r/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/3p4/N4bP1/PPP2B1P/2K1R2R w - -',White moves his d rook to e1 and I take the knight at f3.
22,0,22,Rhf8,b'1k1r1r2/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/3p4/N4bP1/PPP2B1P/2K1RR2 w - -',White joins up his rooks with rook to f1 and I move my h rook across to f8 and my LB is not hanging any more.
23,0,23,Bg4,b'1k1r1r2/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/3p2b1/N5P1/PPP2B1P/2K1R1R1 w - -',White's rook at f1 was probably not the best move as I was blocking the file at f3 and his DB was also on the file at f2.  So white moves the rook across to g1 and I immediately move across to block the file again at g4.
24,0,24,Rf3,b'1k1r4/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/3p2b1/N4rP1/PPP2BRP/2K1R3 w - -',White moves g1 rook to g2 and I move my f8 rook to f3 attacking the DB at f2.  My LB is protecting my rook at f3.
25,0,25,Bh3,b'1k1r4/pp5p/2nb4/4p3/2Np4/5rPb/PPP2BRP/2K1R3 w - -',White now moves his a knight to c4 attacking my DB but this is protected by the rook at d8 so I ignore and move my LB across to attack the rook at g2.
26,0,26,Bb4,b'1k1r4/pp5p/2n5/4p3/1bNp4/5rPb/PPP2B1P/2K1R1R1 w - -',So white retreats his rook back to g1 and I move my DB to b4 to attack the rook at e1.
27,0,27,Rxf2,b'1k1r4/pp5p/2n5/4p3/1bNpR3/6Pb/PPP2r1P/2K3R1 w - -',White moves his rook to e4 and I capture the DB at f2.
28,0,28,Bf5,b'1k1r4/pp5p/2n5/4Nb2/1b1pR3/6P1/PPP2r1P/2K3R1 w - -',White knight captures my pawn at e5 and I move my LB to attack white's rook at e4 protected by the rook at f2.  White's knight can take my knight and check my king on his next move.
29,0,29,bxc6,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/5b2/1b1pR3/6P1/PPP2r1P/2K3R1 w - -',So I cannot take the rook at e4 as white captures my knight putting my king in check.  I captured the knight with my b7 pawn.
30,0,30,Rxc2+,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/4Rb2/1b1p4/6P1/PPr4P/2K3R1 w - -',White now attacks my LB with a move to e5 and I check white's king with my rook at c2 protected by the LB at f5.
31,0,31,d3,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/4Rb2/1b6/3p2P1/PPr4P/3K2R1 w - -',White king moves across to d1 and out of check.  I push my d file pawn to d2 in readiness to queen and also to protect my rook which of course is also protected by the LB.
32,0,32,Rxb2,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/5R2/1b6/3p2P1/Pr5P/3K2R1 w - -',White takes my LB wit the rook and I move across to take a pawn and to give me easier access to the squares on the 2nd row.
33,0,33,Rd2+,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/5R2/1b6/3p2P1/P2r3P/3K1R2 w - -',White moves his g rook over to f1 and brings the rooks together on the f file.  I move my rook to d2 and check the king protected by the DB at b4.
34,0,34,Rc2+,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/5R2/1b6/3p2P1/P1r4P/2K2R2 w - -',The king moves out of check to c1 and I move the rook over to c2 to allow my pawn to access the d2 square.  This checks the king again.
35,0,35,Ba3,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/5R2/8/b2p2P1/P1r4P/1K3R2 w - -',King moves over and out of check to b1 and I move my DB to a3 covering the c1 and b2 squares.  I also have my rook at d8 protecting my pawn at d3.
36,0,36,Rc3,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/8/8/b1rp2P1/P4R1P/1K3R2 w - -',Whites rook is at f1 so it is not easy to move to c1 and check the king and move him off the 1st row as my rook will be captured.  So after white brings his 2nd rook to f2 I move my rook back to c3 expecting he will move along to try to stop my pawn before it queens.
37,0,37,dxc2+,b'1k1r4/p6p/2p5/8/8/b1r3P1/P1p4P/1K3R2 w - -',And white does move his rook to c2 and I capture with my pawn at d2 and check the king with protection from my rook at c3.  With my DB at a3 protecting the c1 square where my pawn would queen white knew he could not affect anything now and the game ended.
38,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"The winner of the game of the season winter 2015/2016 for the ""Sixth Sense"" team is Nairobigal. I am annotating it at the request of the lovely elenapetrova - I never can resist her when she asks me to do something!"
39,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.
40,1,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White appears to be heading for a closed variation.
41,1,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black does the same developing move.
42,1,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White gets her other knight out.
43,1,5,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',It is wise to play this before Nf6 otherwise black may be faced with e4-e5.
44,1,6,a3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a very unusual move but not completely unheard of.
45,1,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black wisely continues to develop.
46,1,8,b4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/1P2P3/P1N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq b3',This is a rather unusual pawn sacrifice - again not completely unheard of. White sacrifices a pawn to open up files on the queen side and to lure balck's c pawn away from the centre. It does have some similarities with the Benko Gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit
47,1,9,cxb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/1p2P3/P1N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So black takes.
48,1,10,axb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/1P2P3/2N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White takes back.
49,1,11,Nxb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/1n2P3/2N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',and now black accepts the pawn gambit.
50,1,12,h4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/1n2P2P/2N2N2/2PP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq h3',This is just a complete beginners move and carries no merit. White wins despite this move not because of it. Sometimes this thrust is justified if black has played g7-g6 but as black hasn't played that move this is just a random thrust on the king side. White could and should have taken the centre with d2-d4 as in another game with this variation which ended in a draw- 7. d4 Qc7 8. Bb2 Nxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxc2+ 10. Kd2 Nxa1 11. Qxa1 Bf5 12. Qa4+ Bd7 13. Bb5 Bxb5 14. Qxb5+ Qc6 15. Qd3 Qb6 16. Bc3 e6 17. Rb1 Qc7 18. d5 e5 19. Bxe5 dxe5 20. d6 Qa5+ 21. Ke2 b6 22. Rb5 Qa2+ 23. Ned2 f6 24. Qc3 Bxd6 25. Qc6+ Ke7 26. Qb7+ Ke6 27. Qxg7 Qa6 28. Qg4+ f5 29.

51,1,13,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2N2/2PP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',Black wisely grabs some central control.
52,1,14,g3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I'm not sure of the reason for this move - maybe to give some protection to the pawn on h4? Maybe to develop the Bf1 to g2 or h3? c4 is also a good square to place the Bf1.
53,1,15,b6,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is also a waste of time.Bg4 looks best.
54,1,16,Bc4,b'r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1nB1P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Bishop moves to an attacking square.
55,1,17,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/1nB1P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Another complete waste of time when black should be getting his pieces out.
56,1,18,1h5,b'r1bqkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p2P/1nB1P3/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This pawn thrust doesn't seem to achieve much.
57,1,19,1Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p2P/1nB1P1b1/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black finally develops a piece! Well done!
58,1,20,1Bb5+,b'r2qkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/1n2P1b1/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is mind-boggling. If black wanted to play this check she could have done it on any of her last 3 moves. By playing this bishop to c4 first she has wasted a move.
59,1,21,1Ke7,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/1n2P1b1/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black doesn't want to retreat any of his pieces.
60,1,22,1Ra4,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/Rn2P1b1/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/2BQK2R b K -',White hits the knight.
61,1,23,1Bxf3,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/Rn2P3/2N2bP1/2PP1P2/2BQK2R w K -',Black now wins a pawn but gives up his lovely bishop on g4. Better was a5.
62,1,24,Nxc2+,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R3P3/2N2QP1/2nP1P2/2B1K2R w K -',This is the pawn black was after.
63,1,25,1Kd1,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R3P3/2N2QP1/2nP1P2/2BK3R b - -',White attacks the knight. Coutner attacking with a6 looks best here but black does the obvious move. 
64,1,26,1Nd4,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R2nP3/2N2QP1/3P1P2/2BK3R w - -',This. However now white has a simple with 15. Rxd4 exd4 16. Nd5+ Nxd5 (if instead Ke6 then 17. Qf5 mate) 17. exd5 and the threat of Re1 is overwhelming.
65,1,27,1Qd3,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R2nP3/2NQ2P1/3P1P2/2BK3R b - -',But white plays this instead. 
66,1,28,1Nb3,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R3P3/1nNQ2P1/3P1P2/2BK3R w - -',This is yet another mistake. Black could have got rid of the dangerous bishop on b5 with Nxb5 or just tried to develop his king-side. The threat of Nc5 attacking rook and queen and so winning the exchange is easily parried.
67,1,29,1Qc4,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/1B2p2P/R1Q1P3/1nN3P1/3P1P2/2BK3R b - -',But this is not the best way to do it better Ba3 developing the Bc1.
68,1,30,1Na5,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/nB2p2P/R1Q1P3/2N3P1/3P1P2/2BK3R w - -',Black counters with an attack on the white queen but the knight is out of play here.
69,1,31,1Qa2,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/nB2p2P/R3P3/2N3P1/Q2P1P2/2BK3R b - -',The Gameknot post-game computer analysis criticises this move and suggests Qd3 as better but I think it is wrong as surely black can then reply with Nb3 again threatening to come into c5 again. What do you think dear reader?
70,1,32,1Ng4,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p3p/nB2p2P/R3P1n1/2N3P1/Q2P1P2/2BK3R w - -',Another wild swipe this time at f2 which achieves little. Black should play a6 18. Be2 Qd7 19. Bb2 Ke8 20. Ke1 Qc6 21. Rh4 Qb7 22. Kf1 Be7 23. d4 Rc8 24. Rb4 d5 and at last most of his pieces are getting to reasonable squares.
71,1,33,1Rf1,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p3p/nB2p2P/R3P1n1/2N3P1/Q2P1P2/2BK1R2 b - -',White meekly protects f2 missing 18. Nd5+ Ke6 19. Nxb6+ Kf6 20. Nd5+ Ke6 21. Ne3+ Ke7 22. Nxg4 winning easily.
72,1,34,1Nf6,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/nB2p2P/R3P3/2N3P1/Q2P1P2/2BK1R2 w - -',Black now stops that - wasting another move in the process - but this was best.
73,1,35,1Nd5+,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p1n1p/nB1Np2P/R3P3/6P1/Q2P1P2/2BK1R2 b - -',White plays the check anyway. Better is f2-f4 tearing open the centre.
74,1,36,1Nxd5,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p3p/nB1np2P/R3P3/6P1/Q2P1P2/2BK1R2 w - -',This is more or less forced.
75,1,37,2Qxd5,b'r2q1b1r/p3kpp1/1p1p3p/nB1Qp2P/R3P3/6P1/3P1P2/2BK1R2 b - -',White correctly takes back with the queen and maintains her advantage rather than with the pawn which would have thrown away her advantage.
76,1,38,2a6,b'r2q1b1r/4kpp1/pp1p3p/nB1Qp2P/R3P3/6P1/3P1P2/2BK1R2 w - -',This is another mistake better is Qc7 to give the black king a flight square.
77,1,39,2Bc4,b'r2q1b1r/4kpp1/pp1p3p/n2Qp2P/R1B1P3/6P1/3P1P2/2BK1R2 b - -',With a horrible threat of Qcf7 mate!

Bxe5 and black can't play f6 or white will sac on g6 probably winning. But it's hard to say without the analysis board! I think that a sac on g6 is still premature here. But I think that Bxe5 is very dangerous. 
181,3,22,1Bg5,b'r4rk1/pb2qp1p/1p4p1/4p1BQ/3p4/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q -',I though it was a funny way to propose Q's exchange and it was. But the outcome won't be good for me and I just allow black to recover the initiative.

White would have recovered the B after Bc8+ (disc) BxB. A crazy position isn't it? Now White threats Qh6 forcing f6 and after it g6 or h7 would fall. Black threats... a lot but not so quickly... does he? So HE RESIGNED. Now the question: was he lost? Any comment appreciated... :-)

190,4,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',c3 is offering the Danish gambit.
191,4,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I prefer not to give up the center to two attacking bishops and no development so I like the Soerensen defense.  d5 allows both of my bishops to get into the mix and provides a counterpunch in the center.
192,4,4,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',A fairly common response White wastes no time regaining pawn parity and has a strong presence with the queen.
193,4,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Standard development.  Aids the d pawn.

196,4,8,Nxc3,b'r1bBkb1r/pppn1ppp/8/8/4P3/2n5/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq -',I knew that my options to castle would die but I opted to try something different.  Perhaps keeping the knight and immediately retaking with 7.... kxd8 would have been better planning to retake the pawn with Bxf2 down the road but I just wanted to see what would happen here...  If White takes Bxc7 I can retake Nxe4.
197,4,9,Nxc3,b'r1bBkb1r/pppn1ppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Best response from White.  Any time you can regain parity and develop a piece it's a win.
198,4,10,Bb4,b'r1bk3r/pppn1ppp/8/8/1b2P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',We're pretty even at this point.  White needs to try and get his castle on to link up his rooks if possible.
199,4,11,Bxc3+,b'r1bk3r/pppn1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2b2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',breaking up his pawns that would eventually threaten my queenside.  My hope is that the 3-2 pawn advantage will turn into a promotion.

203,4,15,1a4,b'r1b4r/ppkn2pp/2p2p2/8/P1B1P3/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - a3',I'm not certain of the utility of this move.  The lone pawn can only do so much.  Odds are bringing the knight closer (Nd4) to the Black king would provide more options for mounting an attack.  The other downside is that this move allows Black to go up a pawn.
204,4,16,1e5,b'r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p2p2/2n1P3/P1B5/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',I think ultimately White would be better served to keep the pawn on a4 as two passed pawns down the line can spell trouble.
205,4,17,Nxa4,b'r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p5/4N3/n1B5/2P5/5PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Despite being up a pawn I need to get my rooks into the game.
206,4,18,1Rd4,b'r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p5/4N3/n1BR4/2P5/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',I'm not interested in taking the c pawn as that would give his rooks and two pieces direct lines of attack on my king.

210,4,22,1Nf3,b'r6r/p1k3pp/2p1b3/1p6/n2R4/2PB1N2/5PPP/5RK1 b - -',I thought White might consider c4 here instead.  This move seems to telegraph a later Ng5 option.  Generally speaking center positions are stronger for knights so this seems like a retreat to me.
211,4,23,1h6,b'r6r/p1k3p1/2p1b2p/1p6/n2R4/2PB1N2/5PPP/5RK1 w - -',Taking away the Ng5 option.

213,4,25,2Nc5,b'r6r/p1k3p1/2p1b2p/1pn5/3R4/2PB1N2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Allowing me to get my own knight back into the game and protecting the bishop at the same time.  Side benefit is that this move also prevents an immediate formation of a rook battery.
214,4,26,2Be4,b'r6r/p1k3p1/2p1b2p/1pn5/3RB3/2P2N2/5PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Giving up a knight for that bishop is very tempting but I'd rather trade rooks first to give me more of an advantage.
215,4,27,2Bc2,b'3r4/p1k3p1/2p1b2p/1pn5/8/2P2N2/2B2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',A bishop is worth far more than a knight right now with this very open board so wise play on White's part.
216,4,28,2a5,b'3r4/2k3p1/2p1b2p/ppn5/8/2P2N2/2B2PPP/4R1K1 w - a6',Looking to take advantage of that pair of passed pawns.
217,4,29,2h3,b'3r4/2k3p1/2p1b2p/ppn5/8/2P2N1P/2B2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Not quite a wasted move... preventing a back-door mate is an okay plan but with no immediate threat perhaps a better position for your power pieces would be more valuable.  Moving the knight to d4 perhaps.  This move seems more like a waiting move than forward progress.
218,4,30,2a4,b'3r4/2k3p1/2p1b2p/1pn5/p7/2P2N1P/2B2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',White is probably getting nervous about the a-b pawns as well he should.  They are about to be trouble.
219,4,31,2Nd4,b'3r4/2k3p1/2p1b2p/1pn5/p2N4/2P4P/2B2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Better late than never!  As Black I now have to deal with the double attack on the LSB.
220,4,32,2Kd6,b'3r4/6p1/2pkb2p/1pn5/p2N4/2P4P/2B2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',I like this move better than Rd6 or Re8 because I will eventually need to get my King down to help secure promotion of the pawns.  Also I want to keep my bishop on this diagonal to help protect my pawn march.  Note that if I move the bishop instead I give up a pawn from Re7+.
221,4,33,2Be4,b'3r4/6p1/2pkb2p/1pn5/p2NB3/2P4P/5PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Not certain what White is thinking here but I will absolutely trade my knight for his bishop.
222,4,34,Bd5,b'3r4/6p1/2pk3p/1p1b4/p2NR3/2P4P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',This move should be expected.  Centralization and protection of the bishop.  Note I now also can attack g2
223,4,35,2Nf5+,b'3r4/6p1/2pk3p/1p1b1N2/p3R3/2P4P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',White is now just helping me go where I want to anyway.  If he takes the g7 pawn it's bad news.
224,4,36,2Rd4,b'3r4/6p1/2p4p/1pkb1N2/p2R4/2P4P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',Decent move thanks to the protecting c3 pawn restricting White's King's movements.
225,4,37,2a3,b'3r4/6p1/2p4p/1pkb1N2/3R4/p1P4P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',The LSB will allow me to march my pawn to a2 with no resistance.  White is about to be in big trouble because he will have to dedicate a piece to prevent promotion or trade piece for pawn.  Note that my king is way closer than his to the action which should be able to provide a decisive difference.
226,4,38,3Ne3,b'3r4/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/p1P1N2P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',Wise play.  He is going to need both pieces to effectively block my promotion.
227,4,39,3a2,b'3r4/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/2P1N2P/p4PP1/6K1 w - -',Decision time for White...
228,4,40,3Nc2,b'3r4/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/2P4P/p1N2PP1/6K1 b - -',White makes a blunder here and I didn't see it.  
229,4,41,3Ra8,b'r7/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/2P4P/p1N2PP1/6K1 w - -',A much better play is Bb3.  Note that White needs to pieces to stop the promotion since my King is right there.
230,4,42,3Na1,b'r7/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/2P4P/p4PP1/N5K1 b - -',It is better for White to trade knight for pawn here rather than block.
231,4,43,3Ra3,b'8/6p1/2p4p/1pkb4/3R4/r1P4P/p4PP1/N5K1 w - -',This move is the clincher as it will allow my king to get into the game and force an unfavorable trade on White.  All in all not too bad a game for a new player.  Thank you for your comments and suggestions.

269,5,37,2Bxf4,b'1r4k1/p1q3pp/8/2p2p2/2b2b2/2P5/PP1QN1PP/R5K1 w - -',So I took.
270,5,38,2Nxf4,b'1r4k1/p1q3pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P5/PP1Q2PP/R5K1 b - -',He takes back.
271,5,39,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/p1q3pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P5/PP1Q2PP/R5K1 w - -',I attack his queen.
272,5,40,2Qf2,b'3r2k1/p1q3pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P5/PP3QPP/R5K1 b - -',Queen has to protect the knight.
273,5,41,2Qd6,b'3r2k1/p5pp/3q4/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P5/PP3QPP/R5K1 w - -',I am now threatening Qd1+ winning. However this threat is easily dealt with and indeed even in this position Qd1+ can be met with Qe1! and there is no great advantage to black. I only considered the replies Rxd1 which loses to Rxd1 forcing Qf1 and the reply Qf1 which loses to Bxf1. I should have just taken advantage of his weak back rank with Bxa2!
274,5,42,2h3,b'3r2k1/p5pp/3q4/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P4P/PP3QP1/R5K1 b - -',So he gives his king an escape hole.
275,5,43,2Qd2,b'3r2k1/p5pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P4P/PP1q1QP1/R5K1 w - -',Now my queen takes up a dominant position and I have an edge again.
276,5,44,2Qxd2,b'3r2k1/p5pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P4P/PP1Q2P1/R5K1 b - -',He virtually has to take.
277,5,45,2Rxd2,b'6k1/p5pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/2P4P/PP1r2P1/R5K1 w - -',Now my rook is very active.
278,5,46,3b3,b'6k1/p5pp/8/2p2p2/2b2N2/1PP4P/P2r2P1/R5K1 b - -',He hits my bishop.
279,5,47,3Bb5,b'6k1/p5pp/8/1bp2p2/5N2/1PP4P/P2r2P1/R5K1 w - -',I want to reposition it on the long diagonal.
280,5,48,3h4,b'6k1/p5pp/8/1bp2p2/5N1P/1PP5/P2r2P1/R5K1 b - -',He prevents g7-g5 driving away his knight from f4 where it protects g2.
281,5,49,3Bc6,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/5N1P/1PP5/P2r2P1/R5K1 w - -',So I continue with my plan. He can't move his knight without losing his g pawn and his rook is tied to defending a2. He is close to running out of moves. 
282,5,50,3a4,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/P4N1P/1PP5/3r2P1/R5K1 b - a3',So he frees up his rook by moving the pawn it was protecting.
283,5,51,3Rc2,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/P4N1P/1PP5/2r3P1/R5K1 w - -',Rb2 was also strong. Notice how my rook and bishop have targets on both sides of the board.
284,5,52,3c4,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/P1P2N1P/1P6/2r3P1/R5K1 b - -',The only way to save the pawn.
285,5,53,3Rb2,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/P1P2N1P/1P6/1r4P1/R5K1 w - -',Now I attack the other pawn.
286,5,54,3Ra3,b'6k1/p5pp/2b5/2p2p2/P1P2N1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',He allows his rook to be tied up protecting the pawn. It was probably better just to let the pawn go and activate his rook. The position is hard to save for white in either case.
287,5,55,3Be4,b'6k1/p5pp/8/2p2p2/P1P1bN1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',I can't afford for him to play Nd5 cutting off my attack on g2.
288,5,56,3a5,b'6k1/p5pp/8/P1p2p2/2P1bN1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',Trying to give his rook some room.
289,5,57,3Kf7,b'8/p4kpp/8/P1p2p2/2P1bN1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',This is best although both a7-a6 and Bc2 were both strong too.
290,5,58,3a6,b'8/p4kpp/P7/2p2p2/2P1bN1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',He continues with his plan.
291,5,59,3Ke7,b'8/p3k1pp/P7/2p2p2/2P1bN1P/RP6/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',I continue to mobilise my king.
292,5,60,3Ra5,b'8/p3k1pp/P7/R1p2p2/2P1bN1P/1P6/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',He attacks my c pawn.
293,5,61,3Kd6,b'8/p5pp/P2k4/R1p2p2/2P1bN1P/1P6/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',So I defend it.
294,5,62,3Rb5,b'8/p5pp/P2k4/1Rp2p2/2P1bN1P/1P6/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',He protects b3 again.
295,5,63,3Ke5,b'8/p5pp/P7/1Rp1kp2/2P1bN1P/1P6/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',I attack his knight.
296,5,64,3g3,b'8/p5pp/P7/1Rp1kp2/2P1bN1P/1P4P1/1r6/6K1 b - -',He protects it.
297,5,65,3Kd4,b'8/p5pp/P7/1Rp2p2/2PkbN1P/1P4P1/1r6/6K1 w - -',I protect c5 once more and my king is now a dangerous attacking piece.
298,5,66,4Ne6+,b'8/p5pp/P3N3/1Rp2p2/2Pkb2P/1P4P1/1r6/6K1 b - -',He thinks he is forking my king and g pawn winning a pawn but I have seen further. My threats will become overwhelming.
299,5,67,4Ke3,b'8/p5pp/P3N3/1Rp2p2/2P1b2P/1P2k1P1/1r6/6K1 w - -',Threatening mate with Rb1 followed by Rh1 mate.
300,5,68,4g4,b'8/p5pp/P3N3/1Rp2p2/2P1b1PP/1P2k3/1r6/6K1 b - -',Played to give his king a flight square on g3. Ok stop and tell me what black should now play?
301,5,69,4Rb1+,b'8/p5pp/P3N3/1Rp2p2/2P1b1PP/1P2k3/8/1r4K1 w - -',Is this what you would have played?

304,6,0,Be2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/8/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Be2 struck me as passive but there is nothing passive about White's play in a minute.
305,6,1,g4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/6P1/3P4/PPP1BP1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq g3',Be2 was apparently preparation for this.  White quickly gets the initiative.
306,6,2,Ng8,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/3p2P1/8/3P4/PPP1BP1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White has the advantage here with more space.
307,6,3,a6,b'r3kbnr/1pqbpppp/p1n5/3p2P1/5P2/N1PP4/PP2B2P/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',To prevent Nb5.

With Black castling on the Queenside White would like to launch a pawn advance there but that would expose the King even further.
309,6,5,e5,b'2kr1bnr/1pqb2pp/p1n2p2/3pp1P1/3P1P2/N1P2N1P/PP2B3/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',Black fights back for a share of the center.

311,6,7,Qg3+,b'2kr1bnr/1p1b2pp/p1n5/3p2P1/3Pp3/2P3qP/PPN1B3/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',Maybe White missed this check.  With the King stuck in the middle of the board Black can snatch a pawn.
312,6,8,Bd6,b'2kr2nr/1p1b2pp/p1nb4/3p2q1/3Pp3/2P1N2P/PP1KB3/R1BQ2NR w - -',Now Black may have a slight pull but Black's K is also fairly exposed.  Black needs to complete development quickly.
313,6,9,2Bxe3,b'2k4r/1p1r1qpp/p1n4n/3p3P/3Pp3/2P1B2N/PPK5/R2Q3R b - -',This position strikes me as chaotic with no strong advantage to either player.  
314,6,10,Kd8,b'3k3r/1p1r1qp1/p1n4p/3p1n1P/3PpBQ1/2P4N/PPK5/R6R w - -',Black has to make sure the Rook isn't pinned.
315,6,11,e3,b'3k1r2/1p1r1qp1/p1n4p/3p1n1P/3P1BQ1/2P1p2N/PPK2R2/7R w - -',White cannot play Bxe3 because of Nxe3+ forking the K and Q.
316,6,12,3Rf3,b'3k1r2/1p1r1qp1/p1n4p/3p1n1P/3P1BQ1/2P1pR1N/PPK5/7R b - -',The position of White's K and R allows a tactic with the Ns.
317,6,13,d4,b'3k1r2/1p1r1qp1/p6p/7P/3p1B2/4pQ1N/PP6/1K5R w - -',Now the position is unbalanced.  Black has two central passed pawns but Black has two minor pieces for a R.
318,6,14,Ke8,b'4kr2/1p1r1qp1/p6p/7P/3p1B2/4pQ1N/PP6/1K3R2 w - -',Black's K was vulnerable to a check from the B while sitting on a dark square.
319,6,15,Qe6,b'4kr2/1p1r2p1/p3q2p/7P/3p1B2/3Qp2N/PP6/1K3R2 w - -',Black starts to make threats that are not easy to meet.
320,6,16,3hxg6,b'4kr2/1p1r2p1/p5Pp/8/3p1B2/4p2N/PP6/1K3R2 b - -',Exchanging Qs makes the two passed pawns more powerful.  
321,6,17,Rf6,b'4k3/1p4p1/p4rPp/3r4/3p1B2/4p2N/PP6/2K2R2 w - -',Threatening to win another pawn.
322,6,18,Rh5,b'4k3/1p4p1/p4rPp/7r/3p1B2/4p2N/PP6/2K3R1 w - -',White's N has nowhere to go!
323,6,19,Rxh6,b'4k3/1p4p1/p4rPr/8/3p4/4p2N/PP6/2K3R1 w - -',Black now has a very good game with a material advantage and the passed pawns.
324,6,20,Kf7,b'8/1p3k2/p2r4/6p1/3p4/3Np3/PPK5/8 w - -',Black tries to keep K and R on different color squares to avoid a simple fork.  White's K has to stay home to prevent the pawns from running to the endzone.
325,6,21,5Ne1,b'8/1p6/p2r4/8/3p2p1/1P2p1k1/P3K3/4N3 b - -',Now Black can force an exchange on very favorable terms.
326,6,22,Kf2,b'8/1p6/p7/8/6p1/1P1Kp3/P4k2/8 w - -',With Kf2 Black takes control of the promotion squares of both passed pawns.  White cannot stop the two potential Qs and resigned here.

366,8,20,Qxg3+,b'r3r1k1/p5p1/1pPp3p/1P5P/2P1Rp2/P5q1/3Q1K2/7R w - -',White moves his defense on the 3rd rank. Opens a window for black to exude massive pressure.
367,8,21,Rxe4,b'r5k1/p5p1/1pPp3p/1P5P/2P1rp2/P4q2/3Q4/6KR w - -',Cat and mouse. Black claims rook.

In e7 the bishop  would have been on the right diagonal to control the a pawn.

Much better was to go out of book and pin his Ne5 with 4...Qe7.  Then he's forced to defend with 5.Qe2.  Afterwards I'd attack again with 5...d6  The problem was that I hyperfocused (spent too much time) on trying to prevent the loss of a pawn.  In doing so I missed the overall picture because the real threat was the win of a piece.

This however is the losing blunder as now he will win my Queen for a Knight with his next move.  Although I don't like anything tied down or pinned much better was 5.Be7  First it develops.  More importantly however is that it was the only way to prevent the ruinous loss of material and thus stay in.  However because of the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules resignation is out of the question.  One of the ideas is seeing how last I'll without the Queen.  And I do quite well regardless.

Instead I'll just keeping digging out my bag of chess quotes for the rest of the game as opposed to trying to see the overall picture.  Or another way of saying it is figuring the entire story that the board is telling me.  In general I'll follow bhidragon's advice since he told me not to do it.  But as teardrop34 noted you have to take into account when the advice works or not since I mentioned about if N or B was worth more based on TA's advice.  If this were level it'd be one thing.  But since I'm lost I decided that what bhidragon told me in our last game does not work here.  Therefore my play will solely be guided by chess bits and wisdom until I'm forced to resign.  And that is also how I lasted as long as I did here.
500,13,7,Qd1,b'r1b1k2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My plan was advancing my d7 playing followed by ...Bg4 to win his Queen.  And if he stopped that with f3 and I had to pull back plan B would be castling and then putting pressure onto his c2 with ....Bf5

My attitude is that this will also help me last those 36 moves because even though he's going to win.

In general I agree that ""To take is a mistake"" especially against someone of this strength.  Like with the chess bits and wisdoms as opposed to the overall picture that quote does not apply to me either for the same reason.  My model is when you're lost you might as well try anything.  And I go back to what I originally thought based on what's outlined by TA and redfoxrising even if were not a WTW game.  Don't give up.  And not resigning is why I'm not following other advice which is in general important.  And it's also why I have the attitude that things which should normally be done doesn't matter.  As now I'm feeling more and more confident.  One thing for sure is that it's lost I'll admit that.  But I'm confident with the fact that at the very least I'll tie and could possibly break the record in terms of how long I'll last which is my goal here.  As lasting longer also shows improvement since it's something that easy19 emphasized which is one of the few things that I deem to be applicable."

Sure the pin is gone and can't tempo for now but part of the plan behind this was not directly (since I don't take over a week) but it's indirectly stalling a lost game.  In this context stalling does not mean taking more time but simply delaying it.  My take is to do just the one move attacks.  When he breaks the real plan I'm still going and haven't been defeated.  It's not about being ""Mr. Know it all"" as some might think.  But it's still boils down to how much longer I'll last.  So far I'm doing better then expected.  Initially I thought I'd only survive 25 moves but mate is not in sight yet.  In fact I also keep in mind that it'll take much longer for white to have a mate."

It's not because there's no threat that I'm hoping to counter without calculation.  Instead I'm hoping to create a threat against him even if it's easy to drive off.

The other reason for taking back was to prevent 36.Re8#  Though looking at it I might have lasted a little longer and would therefore have broken the record.  But it's perfectly because as noted in the intro I last another move which still ties the record.  It's pretty good that it did this well against a non otb runner."

But what I learned is that even though you have to listen to advice and not be pompous by getting out of your comfort zone there's also as teardrop noted times where helpful advice does not apply.  The perfect example was after the Q blunder as I completely ignored what I was told for years which was looking at the overall picture and not taking just because you can.  Although I went overboard with the Rook by taking and constantly showing the chess bits and wisdoms (going into one my largest bags of chess quotes ever) I wound up playing better then expected.  In fact I tied the record for how long I lasted against someone of stronger opposition.

594,15,4,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Signalling that he is playing a Grand Prix attack sort of set-up. I think I should have played Nd4 here attacking the Bishop. It was played out of habit - I normally I meet this move after 2. Nf3 and if Nd4 white can exchange knights.

It is not a bad plan although Qe1 seems to be the only move for white in my opening database.

My computer thinks the advantage now switches from black to white with this move. Computer prefers d6-d5 and I now agree - it blows the centre open for my two bishops.

642,15,52,2Qd3,b'4q3/1p2rbkp/p1np1b2/2p2pp1/2PP1P2/1P1Q4/P1N1NBPP/1R3K2 b - -',This seems a strong reply although computer prefers Ng3.

749,20,0,Bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Similar to what we always see it started off with the Ruy Lopez.  Usually I answer with 4.Ba4 in response to 3...a6  This time I deviated from the mainline.  Doubled pawns was not for the reason for if that were the intention I wouldn't have considered this.  The real reason is that I'm going to win a pawn because his N will no longer be there to defend e4.  Of course he can get it back but something told me that it wasn't going happen since he had missed threats before.  And it happened again.
750,20,1,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/p1p2p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?? That's because 5...Qe7 is what would've gotten it back.  Losing a pawn is generally enough for me to only give it one query.  But there's something else alluming here.  For a while this was where I wasn't sure what he played.  Originally I had 5...e6 recorded but that pawn has been exchanged.  Then I speculated 5...d6 but then what gets played would not have been possible.  After looking at it and studying what it was for at least an hour I figured out that this is exactly what he played.  And it is a blunder as opposed to just a mistake.  The reason being is that this is his weakest pawn.  By moving here Ted's K side is already weakened as he'll run into problems should and when he castles K side.  And when someone exposes their monarch I don't show lienency as the idea is trying to expose the weakness that the opponent leaves for him or herself which is already starting to happen.  It's not happening at the very moment but that will change soon. 
751,20,2,c5,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/p4p2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Advancing the pawn.  My guess is that Ted wants to reduce his doubled pawns.  However Jack did get a little involved and advised him to try to do something with those doubled pawns as they can become a reliability.  We will see that later.
752,20,3,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/p4p2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',So I immediately step on the gas and castle.
753,20,4,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp3p/p4pp1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',?! Very understandable as he wants the long flank for his Bf8 which is why fianchettos are common.  But much better was to bring his Bf8 into play at once.  For one thing this is waisting tempo.  More importantly however is that this exacerbating the exposure creating a further weakness for his monarch.
754,20,5,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/2pp3p/p4pp1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Therefore I continue with my development.  The idea is trying to control the center as that is a way to exploit a weakness like this.
755,20,6,c6,b'r1bqkbnr/3p3p/p1p2pp1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Advancing his other c pawn.
756,20,7,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/3p3p/p1p2pp1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I step back on the gas.  As now it's as though c2-c3 and d3-d4 plan happened.  But in a slightly different form because we have the solid pawn chain.  However the overall picture is that this is a center pawn and it enables me to complete my development which is going to start making Ted's problems visible. 
757,20,8,Bb7,b'r2qkbnr/1b1p3p/p1p2pp1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Placing his Bishop on the longest diagonal.
758,20,9,1Be3,b'r2qkbnr/1b1p3p/p1p2pp1/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Completing my development.  With that being said I have complete control over my center.  And this is the cornerstone to where I start figuring what kind of damage I can cause for black and with more then one variation.
759,20,10,1Bd6,b'r2qk1nr/1b1p3p/p1pb1pp1/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Continuing with his development.  BTW this is where I also figured out that black played 5...f6  At first I thought it was 5...d6 but had that been played he would not have been able to bring his DSB here as the d pawn would block his Bf8 from coming here.  In other words it would only be possible to play 10...Bg7 or 10...Be7 but this is how he answered which is where I figured out his 5th move since the N was attacked.
760,20,11,1Na4,b'r2qk1nr/1b1p3p/p1pb1pp1/2p5/N3P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Seeing one way to exploit the weakness I place my N on the rim.  And forget the saying about them being rim.  It's sometimes good to know.  But other times it's just a guideline.  With that being said I decided that this was the time to deviate from that guideline because at the very least I'm now taking advantage of those doubled pawns.
761,20,12,1Ne7,b'r2qk2r/1b1pn2p/p1pb1pp1/2p5/N3P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',? Developing another piece.  But this is a mistake.  Not only do I exploit those doubled pawns but this will lose one of them in the process leaving him two pawns down.  Plus after my 13th move.  For that reason best was 11...Qe7.  However I believe that Ted did not consider this since his focus might have been to complete the development but missed the threat.  Yes my opponent is like this which I can understand all too well.  That's because I had that problem until my loss against bhidragon which I'll show later in this annotation.  And then it occurred with other losses that you focus on guidelines but miss something that's more important so as to say not seeing the overall picture of what the board is revealing.

But the problem here is that his monarch is as noted weakened due to Ted playing 5...f6?? followed by 6...g6  By playing this move with a weakened King I will now have an attacking force or another of saying it is a monster buildup against his monarch.
767,20,18,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/4n2p/p1pp1pp1/8/4P3/1N1P1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',As this is a cornerstone to that because of what's going to happen on my next move.

I did find other's with hanging pawns which is how I wound up ahead.  In this context however I'm alluding to winning lines caused by an exposed King.  And it starts with this move.  That's because in my last game against bhidragon my monarch was likewise weakened due to an inaccuracy.  I did not see those attacking forces which lost.  So when I played the wrong move he answered by putting pressure on my monarch.  It started with the exact same move which is why I played this.  I also remembered Ken saying that you don't do something just because it worked in one game.  Unfortunately I had to regretfully view that as not applicable to me since I played the same move that turned out to be a mistake against dynamic_dv as it worked in a different game before.  Did the same thing which worked.  And it works here as well.  The idea being is that when bhidragon played this move my R appeared attack although protected by the monarch.  However the attack happened against my K.  So being able to play this same move I'm pretty sure that I can now win.  I'm just calculating a winning line which doesn't take me long to find.

It's a little unsound though as Ted can stop it with 18...Bc8  That's is the best move due to what happens soon.  With that being said however I figured that he'd miss this because once this opponent advances a pawn he continues which happened here.  And that will turn out to be a serious because of...
772,20,23,1Ne6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2n2p/2ppNppQ/8/p3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',This move as now he's either going to lose his Queen for Knight or get checkmated.
773,20,24,1Qc8,b'r1q2rk1/1b2n2p/2ppNppQ/8/p3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Not to my surprise either however Ted protects his Queen but misses bigger threat of mate.  I say that because when he sees something attacked he'll protect but has missed mating threats like this.
774,20,25,2Qg7#,b'r1q2rk1/1b2n1Qp/2ppNpp1/8/p3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',"Right after this game Jack commented and said to Ted ""You let him in"" which is the same thing that happened against bhidragon with his army that swarmed in against my King.  So the lessons to be learned from this game are to figuring out what the opponent might be threatening.  For example Ted focused on trying to get a passed pawn but overlooked the Knight fork with 19.Ne6.  More importantly however is what we saw in charleshiggie's most recent annotation as what occurred is more or less the same idea in my books.  That is to not leave yourself with an exposed King.  Another example is that similar to the Dominao Defense he played ...f6?? with the idea of hitting my N.  The problem is that he lost a pawn and it weakend his monarch.  And when Ted played 8...g6?! he further weakend his King.  In doing so it was an open target for me to swarm in especially when he castled later because of my attacking forces against it."

835,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone! This was one of the most interesting games I have ever played so I thought I might share it with you. My favorite style of play is sacrificial play with forced lines but as I am a very low level chess player and new to this game I rarely get the chance to play them myself. However in this game an opportunity presented itself where i could sacrifice a piece and if the bait was taken - as far as i could see but i actually made a couple of blunders on the way according to the postgame analyzes giving him the opportunity to escape  - every move after that would lead to me winning the end game and in many variations if he should make the wrong move check mate. 
836,22,1,Qh5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',He begins with an opening i was not very familiar with (he is white and I am black). Queen straight to h5 pointing at checkmate at f7 if no action is taken. At his rank i thought it odd to go for such an obvious line but then again he was probably expecting me to see this move yet hoping to capture pawn at c5 if i played g6. 
837,22,2,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Instead I play e6 preventing checkmate and protecting pawn.

841,22,6,1Qb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1Q3P1N/PP4PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Here i see that his king is very vulnerable so i make an effort to remove his castling rights which becomes cruicial later on.

847,22,12,2Kxh3,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3pr3/3q1B2/1QN4K/PP4PP/R6R b - -',Luckily he takes the bait once more and now the deal is sealed.
848,22,13,2Qxf4,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3pr3/5q2/1QN4K/PP4PP/R6R w - -',here he has to prevent checkmate at 25. ..Rh5 and the only play available is his next move;
849,22,14,2g3,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3pr3/5q2/1QN3PK/PP5P/R6R b - -',g3. threatening queen and opening g2 for his king to escape.
850,22,15,2Qf3,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/6p1/3pr3/8/1QN2qPK/PP5P/R6R w - -',But here comes the nail in the coffin. After this move he has no option but to sacrifice his queen to prevent 26. ..Rh5 checkmate. The game goes on for 25 more moves but it is already clear that if dont make any mistakes this game is won. I probably could have played a more effective end game but my mind was already considering this a win (never a good idea i guess) so i focused on my other games and just made sure not to lose my advantage.
851,22,16,Qxb3+,b'8/6k1/6p1/p7/4R3/1q3K2/8/8 w - -',To me this was a very fun game and despite some mistakes that could have ruined my plan I think it is a good example of how important it is to think of the possibilities you have many moves ahead not just the obvious ones that are right in front of you in plain sight :)
852,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game is a training match with one of my teammates in the Kingslayers.  We appreciate your contributions to this annotation so we can all learn together.
853,23,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Alekhine's defense.  Not a personal favorite (I really like Petrov) but very playable.  I like it when I get to practice in training games too.
854,23,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Although a common play is 4. c4 instead I prefer to get my knight into the mix first even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black.
855,23,3,Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',We are all book play so far with no surprises on either side.
856,23,4,Bxf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5b2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A surprise!  I was expecting Black to play e6 instead.  This move is a mistake for Black.  Although it is uncommon to see a mistake this early it is worth exploring why.  The threat of violence is often more potent than the actual violence itself.
857,23,5,Bxf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I have no other choice worth considering but now Black is in a bit of a hole because his knight is being threatened and I essentially got a free strong position for my LSB.  Knights vs bishops is a debate that many have but a long diagonal for a bishop is never a good thing to let your opponent have.
858,23,6,dxe5,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An interesting choice.  I was expecting c6 which is a much stronger move.  c6 protects the knight and gives an egress for the queen to threaten Qa5+.  This move while giving the appearance of being strong actually exposes Black to some serious jeopardy early on.
859,23,7,c4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/2PP4/5B2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',And here we are.  Notice that Black's rook is in danger and will almost certainly be traded for a bishop.  With proper play Black will only go down a pawn but positionally White is in great shape.
860,23,8,Nf4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/4p3/2PP1n2/5B2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Looking to cash in on Nxg2+ perhaps?  Black's knight's defense fe5 is tenuous.  I think Nb6 is a better play - stronger defense on the knight and allows capture of c4.
861,23,9,Bxb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pBp1pppp/8/4p3/2PP1n2/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',No other course worth discussing for White
862,23,10,c6,b'rn1qkb1r/pB2pppp/2p5/4p3/2PP1n2/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',A blunder... better to play Nd7 by far.  Perhaps hoping to equalize with Nxg2+?
863,23,11,Bxf4,b'rn1qkb1r/pB2pppp/2p5/4p3/2PP1B2/8/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Removing the threat of the knight check and that rook isn't going anywhere...
864,23,12,e6,b'Bn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2p1p3/8/2PP1p2/8/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQk -',Hoping to salvage a castle and soldier on.  Although being down a rook sucks everyone makes mistakes and you can still get back in a game.
865,23,13,1Qa4,b'Bn1qk2r/p3bppp/2p1p3/8/Q1PP1p2/8/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b k -',Although White's development is not yet complete with the king safely castled it's time to get that bishop out of there and back into play.  This move seeks to create a path to extract the LSB.
866,23,14,Nxc6,b'3q1rk1/p3bppp/2n1p3/8/Q1PP1p2/8/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',When you are down points it is better to trade pawns and not pieces.  Black would have been better served to let this one go and instead take the pawn trade with Qxd4.
867,23,15,1Nc3,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/8/2Pq1p2/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',We end up in a similar spot but instead Black has one less piece to work with making Black's job easier.  White will now seek to get rid of the doubled f-pawn and hope to trade queens.
868,23,16,1f3,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/8/2Pq4/2N2p2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Seems premature as e5 would have protected it allowing for some pawn march madness.
869,23,17,1Rad1,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/8/2Pq4/2N2p2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',tactical tempo gain.
870,23,18,1Qe5,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/4q3/2P5/2N2p2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I was expecting the queen to protect the pawn instead... This move also potentially allows for a second tempo move later with Rf1e1 as a queen check.
871,23,19,h5,b'5rk1/p3bpp1/4p3/4q2p/2P5/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w - h6',This move doesn't seem to accomplish much it would have been better to push the f pawn or try to get the rook into the game.
872,23,20,Qg5,b'5rk1/p3bpp1/4p3/6qp/2P5/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',I thought Qc5 gave more options...
873,23,21,1Ne4,b'5rk1/p3bpp1/4p3/6qp/2P1N3/5Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Getting my pieces to work for me
874,23,22,1Qf5,b'5rk1/p3bpp1/4p3/5q1p/2P1N3/5Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Qa5 would have been stronger now Black is allowing a queen trade with little effort required for White.  Remember when you are down points trade pawns not pieces as you need them to have a chance to get back into the game.
875,23,23,2Nd6,b'5rk1/p3bpp1/3N4/5p1p/2P5/8/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Offering a trade on knight for bishop or losing another pawn.
876,23,24,Rb8,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/3R4/5p1p/2P5/8/PP3PPP/4R1K1 w - -',A blunder that I missed taking full advantage of.  Although Black has very few options at this point Rc8 would have been better.
877,23,25,2b3,b'1r4k1/p4pp1/3R4/5p1p/2P5/1P6/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Better play is c5.  Two rooks versus one makes promotion or trade pawn for rook trivial.  I set the table a little late but eventually got there... I was focused on possibly getting my two rooks into a horizontal battery to eat the f7 pawn.
878,23,26,2c5,b'4r3/R4pk1/3R4/2P2ppp/8/1P6/P4PPP/5K2 b - -',And a wise choice to resign as the end is near.  Overall a few mistakes for Black early led to restricted choices down the line.  Remember to trade pawns not pieces when you are down.  It's hard to make a comeback without power.
879,24,0,Nd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Neither this nor my third move are the most common but I had taken a look at them and I must say that on the whole I like Black's position.

It was more in the spirit of the position to play. (7... h6 {with good chances of obtaining a type of position like in the variation 3.. .g6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 and a normal game.})

The reason for this deviation however is because I want to make Sue feel the same way that she would for the KID.  In other words I don't want her getting overwhelmed that I do something different.  So by playing it as though it were the Colle's System I think that she'll play better.  In other words one thing I don't like is putting my students on the spot which I felt would happen if I stuck to the continued with the KID.

In that game it was a mistake because it weakened my K side since he had threats.  But in the context of how this game is developing it's not.  First black does not have any immediate K side attacks on me.  Second but more importantly her Rf8 is attacked and is thus forced to defend first.  After which I'll use spend that time to advance my c pawn as this will enable me to safely play Nc3 later on.  That is especially once we exchange pawns where that pawn comes off the board.

Now I wasn't going to say anything because ION said that for coaching it's better to wait until the student has made a real mistake.  I did mention flawless until this move.  But this is inaccurate because a Knight on the rim is grim.  With that being said however the other reason for not saying too much is due to bhidragon's advice of not thinking too much about those chess quotes.  So I comment when it's a position wise mistake based on what the board really indicates.  With that being said I missed a small but not the overall picture.  I was debating on what to do with this move.  Do I attack with 14.g5?? as that appeared to win a N.  Then I remembered that terrible loss with Jack Stockel and combined it here to see if it worked.  Turns out that Sue could defend that N.  However a better move would to sac if I were to play e5.  I calculated a bunch of variations and if I advanced the g pawn there's a variation where she would give up to deliver mate by bringing her Queen and Rook.  So I did not invite attacking forces against this especially after what happened in my loss while training a different due to the exposed K.
925,25,17,1Bc4,b'r1bqr1k1/pppn1pbp/6p1/2P1P2n/2B5/B1N1PN2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I followed TA's method by letting her Nh5 sit there as it's worth less.  Instead I go for a bigger picture by pinning the weakest.  Yes it's always a question of to be or not to be.  And up to people's surprise I did because it worked in a different game.  This is not about to change.  Therefore I ask myself if it works and sometimes experiment which is not a good way to go.  Well it worked in my first game against blitzkov because the mistake happened a move later with a cheapo tactic I attempted which I don't do anymore.  But in my first completed game against dynamic_dv it didn't work.  Not sure if it should be done I just act on instinct since it worked in earlier game without giving it much thought.  I don't see any damage in trying it here.  I also kept in mind that one way or another my e pawn was a goner.  I saw this coming which is why I didn't say anything when Sue advanced her e pawn and I took.  That's because she could get it back sooner or later as what happens here.
926,25,18,1Qd5,b'r1bqr1k1/pppn1p1p/6p1/2PQb2n/2B5/B1N1PN2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',?? This however is a terrible blunder on my part that ought to have resulted in the loss of a piece.  I was not attempting a mate in a move as that's too obvious.  Instead there is another threat afterwards that would be difficult to drive off which is still mate but involving a N+R sac.  I calculated a long line of how.  On the other hand a more experienced player wouldn't have even considered this move because there was something in that line that would've made it fail.  It goes along with what cplusplus11 and reversion have told me of calculating through those lines.  And it wound up becoming a Homework question that I gave to Sue.  The only thing I got wrong was where I said flawless with 13...Nh5 being played.  
927,25,19,1Kg7,b'r1bqr3/pppn1pkp/6p1/2PQb2n/2B5/B1N1PN2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',? Joe: You were flawless until this move. But this is your first mistake as it's going to lose a pawn. But there is a move that I miscalculated in a long line that I was calculating. It was just one move that would've turned things and you could've won a piece here. What would've been the best move in this position?  Sue: I think Re6 would have been the best move. My concentration might be off for a while I lost my Mum three weeks ago and I really miss her chess is helping me cope with my loss but I find myself gazing up at her photo on the wall whilst playing.  Joe: You will make it through it. I know what that's like because I lost my Uncle about 10 or 15 years ago. And I've lost people close to me. It's just one of those obstacles which will take a while. But in that amount of time the obstacle will be surpassed. Best was 15...Bxc3 I was thinking that I'd then play 16.Ng5 and if 16...Bxa1 17.Qxf7+ which is mate in two. 17...Kh8 (forced) 18.Qxh7# But I overlooked that after 16.Ng5 16...Ndf6 or 16...Nhf6 which stops the mate and leaves me a piece down.  Sue: I thought you meant a move more recently than that. Or did you. I will investigate your chess analysis when I feel more composed.  The answer is Be5 x Nf3.  Joe: Almost but it was Be5xNc3.  Sue: That's what I meant got my notation muddied.  Joe: That's ok.  Easy to happen. 
928,25,20,1Nxe5,b'r1bqr3/pppn1Q1p/6pk/2P1N2n/2B5/B1N1P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Fixing the mistake that I made earlier.  That way the student doesn't have the chance to win the piece.  It's important to note that Jack Stockel has done the same thing with me.  They weren't quite as easy.  But after I failed to spot and exploit the mistake he fixed them to take away that opportunity.  A perfect example was a one move back rank that he let me have.  And when I failed he kept his advantage and did not let me mate.
929,25,21,1Qd5,b'r1bqr3/ppp4p/6pk/2PQn2n/2B5/B1N1P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The only thing is that my Queen and Bc4 were en-prise.  Therefore this was the only way to defend both as I studied in a previous annotation.
930,25,22,1Nxc4,b'r1bqr3/ppp4p/6pk/2PQ3n/2n5/B1N1P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',? It wasn't now but much later on I pointed something out important.  It really boils down which is worth more a N or B which I've had troubled as we saw in charleshiggie's annotation followed by the ongoing training game with Ken.  
931,25,23,2Nxd5,b'r1b1r3/p1p4p/1p4pk/2PN3n/8/B3P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So the conversation resumes here.  Joe: After that exchange I played 18.Qd5 and you answered with 18...Nxc4? I know why as that Bishop did appear menacing. But my Queen was a bigger danger. Better was to exchange Queens with 18...Qxd5 After which I'd be forced to take back with Bc4 as it was threatened by your Ne5. Were I to recapture with my Nc3 I'd lose a piece. But by taking my Bc4 followed by 19...b6 black is going to wind up in trouble.  Sue:  I am still not concentrating fully I meant originally to take your queen but forgot that after you had made your move.  Joe: It's ok. Yes when I had those tragedies I was very distracting. There was a different instance in which I was also distracted. I think a good lesson is that when they happen and can control them it's better to hold off and wait until the concentration comes back. Sometimes that isn't possible but in those instances my advice would be to focus on the here and now. I had to learn that the hard way on Friday. That's because the distraction back then led to a terrible mistake which instantly lost.  You will note that after getting another pawn I won't say much anymore because of what ION also noted.  In other words I follow his method and he told me you generally don't want to be too critical when you have the intiative. 
932,25,24,2Rd8,b'r1br4/p1p4p/1p4pk/2PN3n/8/B3P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Attacking the N.  But I'm still going to knab her c7.
933,25,25,Rb8,b'1rbr4/p1N4p/1p4pk/2P4n/8/B3P3/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',More or less forced.  And now comes the time where I'll exchange.  The idea being is to keep Sue's Bc8 locked in since one of the things that you don't is your material tied down like this.  It's not throughout the rest of the game but for now it is restricted.
934,25,26,2Rfd1,b'1rbr4/2N4p/1p4pk/7n/8/B3P3/P4PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',As I'm threatening to win her Rook.  But that wasn't my goal.  In reality it is accomplished since it was liquidating.  The idea being is to exchange pieces when you're ahead.
935,25,27,2Rxd1+,b'1rb5/2N4p/1p4pk/7n/8/B3P3/P4PPP/R2r2K1 w - -',With that being said better for Sue would've been to move the Rook away from the d file.  As noted I wasn't going to say anything since I felt that it would be overcritical with the 2 pawn initiative.
936,25,28,Bg4,b'1r6/2N4p/1p4pk/7n/6b1/B3P3/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Attacking my Rook.
937,25,29,2f3,b'1r6/2N4p/1p4pk/7n/6b1/B3PP2/P5PP/3R2K1 b - -',In calculating a bunch of variations I found this to be the best way to defend.  As not only have I reattacked but she only has two safe guards.  And one of them which is 26...Bf5 will lead to me reattacking which results in the same thing.
938,25,30,2Rd8,b'1rbR4/2N4p/1p4pk/7n/8/B3PP2/P5PP/6K1 b - -',And that is Sue's LSB being pinned to her Rb8. 
939,25,31,2Nf6,b'1rbR4/2N4p/1p3npk/8/8/B3PP2/P5PP/6K1 w - -',Repositioning her N.  But there was no way to save at this point.  Now that we're in the endgame had she left on h5 I would've played answered with g4 this time.  Therefore it would've resulted in the same thing as her N is coming off the board sooner or later.
940,25,32,2Bf8+,b'1rbR1B2/2N4p/1p3npk/8/8/4PP2/P5PP/6K1 b - -',This is the cornerstone as her next move is forced.
941,25,33,2Kg5,b'1rbR1B2/2N4p/1p3np1/6k1/8/4PP2/P5PP/6K1 w - -',I thought hard about to what to do and even considered placing her in check with 29.f4+.  But that would've just been for the thrills of it which isn't always the way to go especially here.
942,25,34,2Be7,b'1rbR4/2N1B2p/1p3np1/6k1/8/4PP2/P5PP/6K1 b - -',Therefore my decision was to play this since it pins her Nf6.
943,25,35,2h6,b'1rbR4/2N1B3/1p3npp/6k1/8/4PP2/P5PP/6K1 w - -',I was a little surprised to see Sue play this.  But my next move was going to be the same move.  And it's the same one that I considered earlier as this will win the N.
944,25,36,3f4+,b'1rbR4/2N1B3/1p3npp/6k1/5P2/4P3/P5PP/6K1 b - -',At first however I considered 30.Bxf6 to further liquidate.  But I figured out a way to get the N.  
945,25,37,3Kf5,b'1rbR4/2N1B3/1p3npp/5k2/5P2/4P3/P5PP/6K1 w - -',As I anticipated.
946,25,38,3Rf8,b'1rb2R2/2N1B3/1p3npp/5k2/5P2/4P3/P5PP/6K1 b - -',"So thinking about Susan Polgar's book ""Chess Tactics for Champions"" I pin again.  This time however there is no way out as I will take it on my next move with check as it'll win another pawn."
947,25,39,Ke4,b'1rb5/2N1B3/1p3Rp1/7p/4kP2/4P3/P5PP/6K1 w - -',But I hold off on taking that pawn since my e3 is a passer which I want.
948,25,40,3Kf2,b'1rb5/2N1B3/1p3Rp1/7p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 b - -',Since it is an endgame I protect by bringing the monarch into action.
949,25,41,3Bd7,b'1r6/2NbB3/1p3Rp1/7p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 w - -',Redeploying her B.  But this is where I'll take that pawn at once.
950,25,42,Bf5,b'1r6/2N1B3/1p4R1/5b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 w - -',Doing what Sue to get the intiative back she attacks my Rook.
951,25,43,3Rh6,b'1r6/2N1B3/1p5R/5b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 b - -',And I defend whilst attacking her h5.
952,25,44,3Re8,b'4r3/2N1B3/1p5R/5b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 w - -',?? And she counterattacks.  But it is a blunder.  As noted however I wasn't saying for the same reason with the advantage.  
953,25,45,3Nxe8,b'4N3/4B3/1p5R/5b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 b - -',My student however brought it up and I replied.  Sue: I might resign soon. made a stupid move without thinking my thoughts elsewhere.  Joe:  Yes it is important to think about each move. I know why you played Re8. The idea was my Bishop. But it was attacked by the Knight. 
954,25,46,3b5,b'4N3/4B3/7R/1p3b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 w - -',Trying to get a passed pawn.
955,25,47,3Nd6+,b'8/4B3/3N3R/1p3b1p/4kP2/4P3/P4KPP/8 b - -',Which I stop.  Now I capture take that pawn on my next move.  But I'll take Sue's B instead as it is her last piece on the board. 
956,25,48,b4,b'8/4B3/7R/5N1p/1p3P2/3kP3/P4KPP/8 w - -',Still trying to get a passer.

959,25,51,4Nxh4,b'8/8/7R/8/1B3P1N/3kP3/P4KPP/8 b - -',But I take her remaining pawn.  With what I have against her lonely I will push my f pawn as it is a passer and closet to the eighth rank.  And I will also give up a pawn to Queen. 
960,25,52,4f8=Q,b'5Q2/8/7R/8/1B5N/1k2P3/5KPP/8 b - -',With that promotion I've got a forced a mate which I'll take advantage.
961,25,53,4Qc5+,b'8/8/7R/2Q5/1Bk4N/4P3/5KPP/8 b - -',And now it is a forced mate.
962,25,54,4Kd3,b'8/8/7R/2Q5/1B5N/3kP3/5KPP/8 w - -',As Sue's only other option was 45...Kb6 but then I'd a mate a move later 46.Ra6 Kb2 47.Qc3+ Kb1 48.Ra1#
963,25,55,4Qd4#,b'8/8/3R4/8/1B1Qk2N/4P3/5KPP/8 b - -',After this game I pm'd Sue on where she went wrong what was mentioned is the moral of this story.  So I said Overall you played pretty well. You started off strong in the beginning but made mistakes which lost pawns. What becomes important to ask is if and when a Bishop is worth more then a Knight or not. For example we talked about exchanging. Better would've been to exchange my N as that's what became powerful. The second that I was two pawns up and you were faced with a cramped position that's when it was going to go downhill. The final blunder was the Rook move because you attacked my Bishop but forgot that the Rook was emprise. So after playing that my pieces became powerful. But the last moral is what you mentioned. And I know what you're going through. When distractions can't be avoided you want to think about the here and now of what's going on the chess board. Because in chess what matters is what's happening at the very moment. Distractions can cause mistakes like what happened in my last game against Ted. Yes focusing on what's happening at the very moment is going to help you in the future.   After that but before this annotation I showed her my loss against Ted in our second game on May 6th.  As I had lost that game by not thinking about the here and now either. 
964,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was the second of games with this time limit - it is the longest setting on the blitz section. I had won the previous one on the white side of a Nimzo-Indian fairly comfortably. As she had annotated that one http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/real-time-game?gm=61234 I felt duty bound to annotate this one.
965,26,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I opened e2-e4 to make a change. I had opened d2-d4 against her in our previous game. Maybe my first mistake?

1006,26,42,2f3,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1p2nq1/1p6/4N3/1BPP1P2/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 b - -',I protect my knight.
1007,26,43,2Nxe4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1p3q1/1p6/4n3/1BPP1P2/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 w - -',She exchanges - giving me a strong centre.
1008,26,44,2fxe4,b'5rk1/5ppp/p1p3q1/1p6/4P3/1BPP4/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 b - -',This recapture also gives me play on the f file.
1009,26,45,2c5,b'5rk1/5ppp/p5q1/1pp5/4P3/1BPP4/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 w - -',She prevents me from playing d3-d4 with a dominating centre.
1010,26,46,2Bd5,b'5rk1/5ppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PP4/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 b - -',I love this square for the bishop. I rather thought I was getting back into the game here. However around here the phone went. It was a chess playing friend who is hard to get hold of. We had a lot to talk about and I foolishly tried to play and chat at the same time.
1011,26,47,2Re8,b'4r1k1/5ppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PP4/PP1B2PP/4R1K1 w - -',She develops her rook.
1012,26,48,2Rf1,b'4r1k1/5ppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PP4/PP1B2PP/5RK1 b - -',I hit f7.
1013,26,49,2Re7,b'6k1/4rppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PP4/PP1B2PP/5RK1 w - -',She protects.
1014,26,50,2Be3,b'6k1/4rppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PPB3/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',So I hit the c pawn.
1015,26,51,2Rc7,b'6k1/2r2ppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PPB3/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',She protects again.
1016,26,52,2Bf4,b'6k1/2r2ppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4PB2/2PP4/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',So I hit the rook again.
1017,26,53,2Re7,b'6k1/4rppp/p5q1/1ppB4/4PB2/2PP4/PP4PP/5RK1 w - -',Rook moves. Now surely best is Be3 and black has to somehow figure out how to stop the repetition. But as I said I was foolishly trying to conduct a telephone conversation at the same time and I made a terrible mistake.
1018,26,54,2Bd6,b'6k1/4rppp/p2B2q1/1ppB4/4P3/2PP4/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Thinking I was attacking the rook again. As soon as I made it I realised my mistake.

1020,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My usual.
1021,27,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Normally I play against the Ruy Lopez.  But I believe that Jack's idea is getting me out of my comfort zone which I find good for learning purposes after what I noted in a recent epic game with my mentor.  So he does something a little different.  However I know this style of play as well.  When Jack doesn't play 1...e5 he generally answers with the Siclian Defense.  And as noted this is the first defense that he made me learn.  So just like what I've done in the past combined with what happened in my first game against tipsyjourneyman we're going into the Open Variation.
1022,27,2,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',It's here that I don't know what to do.  So I continue with my development whilst putting pressure on his Nf6.  The idea being is to treat this as though it were a Ruy Lopez Opening but with a different position.  That's because in the other opening black's Nb8 is advanced which is why white plays Bb5.
1023,27,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',As usual Jack imposes his pin.
1024,27,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',So I try to take advantage of that by continuing my development.
1025,27,5,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',So he develops whilst breaking the pin.
1026,27,6,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',And that's when I use the opportunity to get my monarch to safety.  Joe: I'll castle or go home.  Jack: Very good.
1027,27,7,Nbd7,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Continuing with his development.
1028,27,8,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',But since my development is complete and I've castled I'm continuing center control by centralizing one of my Rooks.
1029,27,9,h6,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbpp1/p2ppn1p/6B1/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',He hits my B.
1030,27,10,1Be3,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nbpp1/p2ppn1p/8/3NP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',And I protect.  It is true that I also could've defended with 10.Bh4 for sure.  But that enables him to play 10...g5 forcing 11.Bg3 where I feel that it would be cramped because I wouldn't know of a better place to the Bishop afterwards.  So my attitude is to prevent that by trying something a little different.  In doing so I'm also working on getting out of my comfort zone.
1031,27,11,1b5,b'r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/3NP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq b6',Getting a pawn chain.  But there's more to it then meets.  As I assume that Jack intends to play 10...b4  Normally I wouldn't mind being forced to defend with 11.Nce2 except that my N is crammed there.  And as many know I try to avoid the cramp position as that's where I once started to go wrong.
1032,27,12,1b4,b'r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/1P1NP3/2NBB3/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq b3',So I stop Jack's plan with this move.
1033,27,13,1Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1b1nbpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/1P1NP3/2NBB3/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',So he continues with his development and attacks my e4.
1034,27,14,1Bd2,b'r2qk2r/1b1nbpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/1P1NP3/2NB4/P1PB1PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Therefore I defend as I'm counting his attacks against my Defenses.  And in doing so I realized that my DSB was blocking a defender.  By playing this it's unblocked so that Jack doesn't win anything yet.
1035,27,15,1Ne5,b'r2qk2r/1b2bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p2n3/1P1NP3/2NB4/P1PB1PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Putting pressure on my d3.  I know because of what happened in a different training game.
1036,27,16,1f4,b'r2qk2r/1b2bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p2n3/1P1NPP2/2NB4/P1PB2PP/R2QR1K1 b kq f3',So I stop it by attacking his Ne5.
1037,27,17,1Nxd3,b'r2qk2r/1b2bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/1P1NPP2/2Nn4/P1PB2PP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',He takes.

1040,27,20,1Qg4,b'r2qk2r/1b1nbpp1/p2pp2p/1p6/1P1NPPQ1/2NP4/P2B2PP/R3R1K1 b kq -',"But I try to take advantage of that by attacking his g7.  He said ""Oho look at that.  Allright that's allowed."""
1041,27,21,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbpp1/p2pp2p/1p6/1P1NPPQ1/2NP4/P2B2PP/R3R1K1 w - -',And I said I figured that you'd castle at some point.
1042,27,22,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbpp1/p2pp2p/1p2P3/1P1N1PQ1/2NP4/P2B2PP/R3R1K1 b - -',"Meanwhile I go for a pawn exchange.  And it's a clear indication that Jack was going to accept because he said ""That is allowed."""
1043,27,23,Bg5,b'r2q1rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p2p/1p2P1b1/1P1N2Q1/2NP4/P2B2PP/R3R1K1 w - -',Trying to exchange material and I go along with it.  My idea is to just exchange with stronger player.  After a different training game I felt that I might benefit from accepting that.
1044,27,24,2a4,b'r4rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p3/1p2P1p1/PP1N4/2NP4/6PP/R3R1K1 b - a3',Knowing all that and my semi open file I attack his b5.
1045,27,25,2Rac8,b'2r2rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p3/1p2P1p1/PP1N4/2NP4/6PP/R3R1K1 w - -',But he reattacks my N.
1046,27,26,2Nb1,b'2r2rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p3/1p2P1p1/PP1N4/3P4/6PP/RN2R1K1 b - -',I discussed this move with him.  But not knowing what to do I retreat back here.  I felt that anywherelse except for the rim would lose it.  And I don't want to place it on the edge of the board as first that's how it loses value.  Second I'm trying to set a good example of my students since a Knight on the rim is grim.
1047,27,27,2bxa4,b'2r2rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p3/4P1p1/pP1N4/3P4/6PP/RN2R1K1 w - -',This is where he captures.
1048,27,28,2Rxa4,b'2r2rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3p3/4P1p1/RP1N4/3P4/6PP/1N2R1K1 b - -',Like before I take back.
1049,27,29,2Rc7,b'5rk1/1brn1pp1/p3p3/4P1p1/RP1N4/3P4/6PP/1N2R1K1 w - -',At first I wasn't sure why Jack played this.  But after what's occurring and how the game is developing yes it all makes sense.  The idea is that he anticipates my next move since I like exchanges.  In the process I'm forced to recapture with my Nd4 which enables him to create a nasty threat.
1050,27,30,2b5,b'5rk1/1brn1pp1/p3p3/1P2P1p1/R2N4/3P4/6PP/1N2R1K1 b - -',So I attempt to do another exchange which he accepts.  However this could for the future be bad.  Thinking about what I like to do is a way that I miss the overall picture which shows just complicated this game gets.
1051,27,31,Rc2,b'5rk1/1b1n1pp1/4p3/1N2P1p1/R7/3P4/2r3PP/1N2R1K1 w - -',I'm lucky here but Jack has a threat which cannot be ignored.  But I realized that in the future that threat could become a reality in which I wouldn't be able to defend.  Yes a good example was that loss with bhidragon.  I look at other factors and compare it here.  Not as extreme but we could've been talking about inevitable problems.  However there is a way out since he threatens to win a pawn with discovered check.  I could open up by advancing the g pawn.  But I'd rather not expose the monarch yet since we're just a little off from the endgame.
1052,27,32,2Rg4,b'5rk1/1b1n1pp1/4p3/1N2P1p1/6R1/3P4/2r3PP/1N2R1K1 b - -',So I stop the threat with this move instead as it is a little more aggressive.
1053,27,33,2Nxe5,b'5rk1/1b3pp1/4p3/1N2n1p1/6R1/3P4/2r3PP/1N2R1K1 w - -',Up to my surprise Jack takes.  The reason for being surprised is because I'll take the N.  But then comes a different line which is also interesting.  In fact I told him why this move surprised me.
1054,27,34,Rc1+,b'5rk1/1b3pp1/4p3/1N2R1p1/6R1/3P4/6PP/1Nr3K1 w - -',"He said ""Yes but I need to do something to get it back.""  And it is obviously this move."
1055,27,35,2Nd6,b'5rk1/1b3pp1/3Np3/4R1p1/6R1/3P4/5KPP/1r6 b - -',So I attempt to exchange here.
1056,27,36,2Bd5,b'5rk1/5pp1/3Np3/3bR1p1/6R1/3P4/5KPP/1r6 w - -',Unlike before however Jack declines.
1057,27,37,2Rexg5,b'5rk1/5pp1/3Np3/3b2R1/6R1/3P4/5KPP/1r6 b - -',Therefore I even things out by taking his pawn.  And now this has become an endgame.  This means that I will be using my monarch pretty soon.  But I start things by threatening to win a pawn but I'm also keeping in mind that one should bring the Rooks together and align them on one file after a loss against this mentor just before I went to Florida in February. 
1058,27,38,2g6,b'5rk1/5p2/3Np1p1/3b2R1/6R1/3P4/5KPP/1r6 w - -',Protecting the pawn.
1059,27,39,3h4,b'5rk1/5p2/3Np1p1/3b2R1/6RP/3P4/5KP1/1r6 b - h3',So I try something different as this will advance to h5 in the future which is the plan.
1060,27,40,3Rb2+,b'5rk1/5p2/3Np1p1/3b2R1/6RP/3P4/1r3KP1/8 w - -',Not waisting any time he delivers a check.  
1061,27,41,3Kg1,b'5rk1/5p2/3Np1p1/3b2R1/6RP/3P4/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',Not knowing why he'd do that I tried to get a draw by rep since I anticipated 31...Rb1+.  And the idea is that I'd go back to f2 and this would continue until I could declare the draw.
1062,27,42,3Rd8,b'3r2k1/5p2/3Np1p1/3b2R1/6RP/3P4/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',Not surprisingly Jack stops that by attacking my N.
1063,27,43,3Ne4,b'3r2k1/5p2/4p1p1/3b2R1/4N1RP/3P4/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',Not being able to do everything I decide that if he's going to take I get something out of it.  Therefore it's an exchange as opposed to the loss of a piece.
1064,27,44,Kh7,b'3r4/5p1k/4p1p1/6R1/4P1RP/8/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',Getting his monarch in the action.
1065,27,45,3h5,b'3r4/5p1k/4p1p1/6RP/4P1R1/8/1r4P1/6K1 b - -',And this is where I advance in an attempt to promote.  But that's a very long range strategy.  I'm also keeping in mind that Jack can't take it without getting mated.
1066,27,46,3Rg8,b'6r1/5p1k/4p1p1/6RP/4P1R1/8/1r4P1/6K1 w - -',So he gets rid of the pressure.
1067,27,47,3Kh2,b'6r1/5p1k/4p1p1/6RP/4P1R1/8/1r4PK/8 b - -',Consequently I play this to get the distant opposition.  
1068,27,48,3Re2,b'6r1/5p1k/4p1p1/6RP/4P1R1/8/4r1PK/8 w - -',Putting pressure on the e file.
1069,27,49,3Kg3,b'6r1/5p1k/4p1p1/6RP/4P1R1/6K1/4r1P1/8 b - -',But I don't care because of what the monarch does in the endgame.  
1070,27,50,3Kh6,b'6r1/5p2/4p1pk/6RP/4P1R1/6K1/4r1P1/8 w - -',Increasing the power of his King.
1071,27,51,3Kh4,b'6r1/5p2/4p1pk/6RP/4P1RK/8/4r1P1/8 b - -',?! Therefore I go back to the distant opposition for the same reason as noted earlier.  However Jack implied that this is where I start to go wrong.  By that he was alluding to this position since my monarch along with the Rooks and h5 pawn are tied up.  It's even but the problem is my e4 which is an essential pawn.  While it's defended now that pawn is weakened and can run into problems later on.  The idea is that my position is locked and thus restricted.  In doing so he implied that better would've been Kf1 followed by Ke1.  The idea being would've been to centralize the monarch where I could then handle the threat against e4.  By playing this the pawn is more vulnerable.
1072,27,52,3Re1,b'6r1/5p2/4p1pk/6RP/4P1RK/8/6P1/4r3 w - -',Threatening a nasty check.
1073,27,53,3hxg6,b'6r1/5p2/4p1Pk/6R1/4P1RK/8/6P1/4r3 b - -',Which I stop by exchanging.
1074,27,54,4Kg3,b'8/8/4p1pk/8/4P1R1/6K1/6P1/4r3 b - -',Seeing how powerful his monarch now is I pull back.
1075,27,55,4e5,b'8/8/6pk/4p3/4P1R1/6K1/6P1/4r3 w - -',Jack advances.
1076,27,56,4Kf2,b'8/8/6pk/4p3/4P1R1/8/5KP1/4r3 b - -',"I don't know what he was aiming for when playing 40...e5 but I don't want to chance because as archduke_piccolo said ""Don't trust your opponent.""  Whatever it is I don't trust Jack either.  So I decide not to chance by attacking his Rook since it appeared that he was planning to use that for a devastating against my e4."
1077,27,57,4g3,b'8/8/6pk/4p3/4P1R1/6P1/5K2/r7 b - -',This is where I take advantage of my opportunity to advance.
1078,27,58,4Ra4,b'8/8/6pk/4p3/r3P1R1/6P1/5K2/8 w - -',Still hitting my e4.
1079,27,59,4Kf3,b'8/8/6pk/4p3/r3P1R1/5KP1/8/8 b - -',Once again I defend.
1080,27,60,4Kh5,b'8/8/6p1/4p2k/r3P1R1/5KP1/8/8 w - -',Putting pressure against Rook and King.
1081,27,61,4Rh4+,b'8/8/6p1/4p2k/r3P2R/5KP1/8/8 b - -',So I return the favor by placing Jack in check as his next move is first.
1082,27,62,4Rg4+,b'8/8/6p1/4p1k1/r3P1R1/5KP1/8/8 b - -',And the idea behind was this move.  Like before I'm trying to get a draw by repetition against him as this is a drawish position.  In the past I offered Jack a draw but he's declined.  In fact we discussed it in the end of what would've happened if it were offered.  It turns out that he also would've declined because of the same thing.  In it Jack said that you had to play out the draw and earn before he'd accept the offer.
1083,27,63,4Kf6,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/r3P1R1/5KP1/8/8 w - -',With that being said I presume that he saw my intention which is why Jack played this as opposed to 45...Kh5.
1084,27,64,4Rh4,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/r3P2R/5KP1/8/8 b - -',Knowing that it's not easy I attempt to pin Jack's g6.
1085,27,65,4Ra3+,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/4P2R/r4KP1/8/8 w - -',Which he stops with this move.
1086,27,66,4Kg4,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/4P1KR/r5P1/8/8 b - -',?? This however is where I really go wrong.  In other words it's the decisive mistake.  Ok things aren't locked in anymore.  But my monarch was needed in the center as opposed to away from it.  In fact he implied that this is the losing blunder.  The other move which I mentioned being 35.Kh2 was not the losing blunder.  And it wasn't the K move per say.  But rather things along with that were locked in which made it vulnerable because I couldn't use the full power of my monarch.  However that did not mean that I couldn't defend against it.  But with this move I can no longer defend my e4 which is the essential.  As once Jack takes he'll have an unstoppable passer.  With that being said 47.Ke3 was the only way to save this position to prevent his next move.    
1087,27,67,4Re3,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/4P1KR/4r1P1/8/8 w - -',As noted that pawn is now a goner.
1088,27,68,4Kh3,b'8/8/5kp1/4p3/4P2R/4r1PK/8/8 b - -',Trying to prevent a check.  But it doesn't matter much anymore.  That's because white has no good moves left.
1089,27,69,4g5,b'8/8/5k2/4p1p1/4P2R/4r1PK/8/8 w - -',Hitting my Rook.
1090,27,70,4Rh6+,b'8/8/5k1R/4p1p1/4P3/4r1PK/8/8 b - -',So now is the time to throw in the check for the thrills of it since white is busted anyhow.
1091,27,71,5Re6,b'8/6k1/4R3/4p1p1/4P3/4r1PK/8/8 b - -',At first my attitude was that if he takes I'll take back.  Can't happen because of how far up his Rook is.
1092,27,72,5Rxe4,b'8/6k1/4R3/4p1p1/4r3/6PK/8/8 w - -',After this move we discussed what would happen.  In fact I resigned because I only had 10 or 15 minutes before having to leave.  Plus with the Rook behind passed pawn he was going to promote.  But even then were it not for the time crunch I would've played on.  And Jack said that resignation was premature.  So the next 5 moves are some of the variations we played through.  After that we did a little more but I lost track.
1093,27,73,Kf5,b'8/R7/8/5kp1/8/4pKP1/8/4r3 w - -',But he was showing where I might have been able to draw against a weaker player.  That's because if black were to blunder by letting my monarch in I would've been able to take his g5.  He showed me where that could happen.  But against his strength it won't work.  For afterwards we spent two or three more minutes studying what Jack would've done and how he would've prevented the draw.  He would've brought the monarch in similar to this so that I would not get that pawn.  Then he'd keep pushing his e pawn until a promotion was inevitable.  After this game we spent the remainder of what I had left continuing Tom's game against Jack as Homework because of what happened in this game.  Yes Tom came in a little earlier then usual.  As what usually happens there was not enough time for him to finish against Jack.  Tom's only advantage was being a pawn up.  However it was a question of what to do with that passed pawn since they were doubled.  With time running out for him Tom offered a draw which Jack accepted.  So we continued and likewise he showed what the monarch can do in the endgame.  And I played a move that would've lost that extra pawn.  Afterwhich it would be more or less drawn.  But the idea is that Jack would've gotten it back with his King.  With that being said the morals are first you don't want anything tied down but especially in the endgame.  What I noted on the 35th although not the losing blunder was the first of the problems being that my R+K were tied down and couldn't do as much.  That enabled Jack's pieces to get more powerful.  Second but more importantly came the 47th move in which my King was out of play when getting out of check.  Instead of centralizing it with 47.Ke3 where my e pawn would've been protected I played 47.Kg4?? which enabled Jack to win the important pawn.  After that things were going to go downhill.  So other lesson is that since the monarch is a powerful weapon in the end game keep where it's needed.  Don't move the King away from where it's important as otherwise it's out of play.  As bringing anything out of play but especially in the endgame can have devastating consequences as they did here.

1104,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I start off with my usual and so does Ted.  Therefore it's as usual going to become a Ruy Lopez.
1105,29,1,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The usual response.  So I'll answer with the conventional move as well.
1106,29,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Usually he answers with 4...b5 which is the most common response.  However there's nothing wrong with this move.  And bringing the other N although it hasn't transposed into this line this became something like the Berlin Defense.  The only differences are that whites LSB is not on a4 and black's a pawn hasn't advanced.  Otherwise it's the same idea.
1107,29,3,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I treat it as though it were the Berlin Defense since is the most common reply to that.
1108,29,4,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',Now it goes back to what you most see in the Ruy Lopez.  So my next move will be the same.
1109,29,5,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p4n2/np2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',? Ted often plays that.  But this is where that bringing the N is on the rim but not the normal reason.  What I mean is that it's not due to the guideline of a N on the grim is rim.  Instead there's more to it as this move is going to lose a pawn.  In the past I'd just castle and allowed an exchanged.  However seeing that e5 is not defended I take especially given that my e4 is on the other hand protected by my Nc3.
1110,29,6,c5,b'r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p4n2/npp1N3/4P3/1BN5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq c6',?? I'm not sure why he played this.  He was certainly fatigued here so my guess is that he was zoning out.  But this is already going to result in ruinous loss of material.  With that being said 7...Qe7 was forced.  Back in the day I'd answer with Bxf7+ only to take away his right to castle and win a pawn.  Seeing however that I can fork with my N and get his Rook I'm going to do that.  BTW this was not my original intention for had it been I wouldn't have taken on e5.  That's because it would be a cheapo tactic which they can drive away.  The real reason behind my last move was because it wins a pawn with no way to defend.  This blunder as noted is going to spell disaster.
1111,29,7,c4,b'r1b1kb1N/3p2pp/pq3n2/np6/2p1P3/1BN5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQq -',Sort of overlooked but am not surprised to see Ted play this.  I was wondering what to in order to capitalize on my advantage.  Yes he is going to a piece but the question is can I get something to exacerbate the situation?  Definitely and I am going to do that with my next move.
1112,29,8,1O-O,b'r1b1kb1N/3p2pp/pq3n2/1p6/2n1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b q -',Knowing my advantage I capitalize on that as noted by Susan Polgar in an e-mail course by castling.
1113,29,9,1Bb7,b'r3kb1N/1b1p2pp/pq3n2/1p6/2n1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w q -',Continuing his development whilst attacking my e4.
1114,29,10,1e5,b'r3kb1N/1b1p2pp/pq3n2/1p2P3/2n5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b q -',So I attack in an attempt to protect while gaining tempo.  I'll admit that this the one thing I need to stop thinking.  That's because this move is a mistake as he will get a pawn back.  Better was to move my Queen to the e file.  Beyond that (so best) however was 12.Re1.  Not only does this protect the e pawn but it centralizes a Rook.  And as I recently learned one way of controlling the center is to centralize the Rook.
1115,29,11,1Re1,b'r3kb1N/1b1p2pp/pq3n2/1p2n3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b q -',Remebering here about centralization I play that move now.  But it would've been better a move earlier as now he has gotten back a pawn.
1116,29,12,1O-O-O,b'2kr1b1N/1b1p2pp/pq3n2/1p2n3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',?? But this was another blunder as it loses another piece.  Much better would've been 13...Qd4  Best however was 13...Bd6 as not only is the N protected but Ted has completed his development as well.
1117,29,13,Ng4,b'2kr1b1N/1b1p2pp/pq6/1p2R3/6n1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ2K1 w - -',?? Kicking my Re5.  I'm presuming that fatigue combined with tempo gain obsession led to this mistake.  But this is yet another blunder as I'm going to win a piece.  Just about anything else was better then this move.  For me just that hyperfocus and fixation was enough to make a mistake like this.  When however you add fatigue yes I'm understand where Ted comes from as I used to cope with that pattern.  In fact the week before I played two games.  The second one was annotated where I applied what I learned from the N+B mate.  But in the game before my play was horrible and wound up making terrible mistake.  Therefore I should not have won that first game.  With best play I should've gotten a draw at best.  I was very lucky that Ted didn't see the mistake and it was then that I was able to figure out and force a win.  But the mistake was directly caused by only getting 6.5 hours of sleep the night prior.  Not only that but I had a cup of coffee before the chess club and started getting tired shortly there after.  This led to a mistake in the game after but was somehow able to find enough energy to apply what I learned about how to mate with N+B.
1118,29,14,1Qxg4,b'2kr1b1N/1b1p2pp/pq6/1p2R3/6Q1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B3K1 b - -',Once I took again Ted resigned as black figured out that he didn't stand a chance.  Right after this game my opponent told me that he was not concentrating and got a cup of coffee to help him stay awake.  That's how I could tell that he was fatigue because in the next game (which was my most recent annotation) he played much better and won.  That's because when I made that super blunder due to being distracted from the jazz band warm up and major time crunch he won my Queen.  And I resigned right afterward.  So the moral of this story is to be well rested before a chess game.  If you're playing and did not get enough sleep the night before you'll wind up fatigue.  That can cause blunders which in the end become costly and that's what happened here.
1119,30,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Ted starts off with his usual.
1120,30,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',In general I like the Sicilian Defense.  But I'm going by something that reversion told me which was trying different things.  Though I have played against it and even got a lucky win against a stronger opponent with the Caro Kann more work needed to be done.  That's why in the original Chess Coaches and Mentors club caveman1980 did a training game where I'd chose what defense I wanted him to play.  My choice was the Caro Kann and that loss proved that I needed more work.  Last week was the first time that I played the defense against Ted but that game timed out though since we only started with 15 minutes.  As I once mentioned time controls are not absolute for most players but they are for me due to the work schedule.  Now that I can start later though I allowed an increment of 10 minutes which is how I wound up with almost an hour because due to my hours getting cut the shift started a little later.  Knowing this I decided to like last week answer with the same defense.
1121,30,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! I know why Ted played this since that's generally the best follow up.  But unless the Domiano Defense is played the best move is often 2.d4 when black's first move involves advancing the pawn one square.  The Caro Kann Defense is not an exception.
1122,30,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',? Not knowing what to do I decide to place pressure on Ted's center.  I also could've played 2...Nf6 but then white could easily defend with 3.Nc3  Since I'm not used to this my idea is making things difficult for him.
1123,30,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not surprisingly however Ted does not abide as he keeps it protected.  Believe it or not this is the move that I had anticipated.  
1124,30,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And this was my plan in the aftermath due to his Nf3 being pinned.  My idea was creating tension.
1125,30,6,h3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/6b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not surprisingly he breaks it.  But I would've done that by continuing to develop with 4.Be2.
1126,30,7,Bxf3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/8/5b1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Normally I would not have taken but rather retreated with 4...Bh5 and not been concerned with 5.g4 Bg6  But with something different I wasn't going to chance the loss of tempo.  Instead the other plan behind the pin was breaking and then exchanging.  After which (since taking with the Queen is better then the g pawn) his Queen would be left out early.  After which I'll use that time to continue with my development.  What's better is that since my LSB becomes off the board I don't have to worry about a cramped position as it won't happen here.  Therefore when he takes back there's no limits since the N isn't force on the rim.  Taking advantage of that I answer with 5...Nd7.
1127,30,8,d4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq d3',Opening up a line for Bc1 and achieving a pawn chain with his e5 and d4.  More importantly however is the fact that he's protecting his e5.
1128,30,9,e6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',So I also keep my e pawn protected.

1130,30,11,c5,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P4Q1P/1PP2PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',But I go for a pawn exchange.  The idea being is that if he takes and I take back my Nd7 is better placed.  Although not cramped I remember Susan Polgar mentioning about the importance of getting the Knight to a better outpost.  And Kenneth_fiore said that placement of pieces is essential.
1131,30,12,Nc3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1N2Q1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',? Continuing with his development.  But this move is a mistake as I will now win a pawn.  Much better would've been 8.dxc5.  When that happens Ted will be forced to retreat afterwhich I will get a second pawn.
1132,30,13,a6,b'r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/1N1pn3/3p4/PQ5P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',? Trying to gain a tempo.  As corrected before you have to base it on the position.  But in this context I thought that it was playable.  Terrible thought process as I overlooked his next move.  As usual one move attacks fail more often then not.  Then again I don't if I could've prevented him from getting a pawn back.  I thought that the best move would've been 10...d3 but he has another attacker and can still get my d4 one way or another.
1133,30,14,Nf6,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pn3/3N4/PQ5P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Meanwhile being way behind in that department I continue with my development.  
1134,30,15,1Bf4,b'r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pn3/3N1B2/PQ5P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',So does Ted.

Worth noting that I'm not distracted yet got fixated on developing that I once again wound up overlooking this attack.
1136,30,17,Nh5,b'r2qk2r/1Q3ppp/p2bp3/3pn2n/3N1B2/P6P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Thinking about what to do I decide to attack his Bf4 by placing my N on the rim.
1137,30,18,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/1Q3ppp/p1Nbp3/3pn2n/5B2/P6P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',And he defends.  But this is where I start running low on time.  Plus the middle school has just set up their instrument as there is bound to be a jazz band concert.  In fact they're warming up on the other side of the room and everyone is feeling the vibration.
1138,30,19,1Nxf4,b'r2qk2r/1Q3ppp/p1Nbp3/3pn3/5n2/P6P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',"?? With that being said I took his Bf4 without thinking twice about it.  This is a basic mistake that a mentor told me not to do which I taught my students.  But the two things that affected my play was the time crunch (which I've dealt with before).  More importantly however was the warmup from the jazz band.  Therefore I captured because it looked good figuring that Ted made a mistake by not defending his Bishop.  But this is where ""To take is a mistake"".  Another way of looking at it is that I missed the important since my Queen is en-prise which makes this move a super blunder.  That was why he played 14.Nc6  With that being said the only way to save the position was to exchange with 14...Nxc6.  If things were normal and we didn't have a jazz band I would not have made this mistake.  That's because I would've focused on what Ted was threatening before taking his Bishop.  On the other hand it might as well be for had I played the right move I'm 99% positive that we wouldn't have finished as the game would've timed out.  When this mistake occurred there was only about 6 minutes and the game is far from over.  If I didn't have to work things would be different as they allow people to stay late.  But one must show up and be on time for work in my place.  So the work schedule takes precedence."
1139,30,20,1Nxd8,b'r2Nk2r/1Q3ppp/p2bp3/3pn3/5n2/P6P/1PP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',"With that being said winning my Queen was enough for me to resign.  If there was more time I would've played on.  That's because on one or two occasions I made a somewhat similar blunder and lost my Queen.  But using TA's blitz Q sac methods I managed to win.  The fact though is that I had to go so I was just going to forfeit.  When this happened Jack looked at me and was quite frustrated that I let him win my Queen.  I told my teacher that I was distracted by the time issue (although I forgot to mention about the band.)  And he said that it was inexcusable as I just shouldn't have overlooked it.  Normally I agree with that but not this time.  I concur that the mistake ought to not have been made since I'm too experienced for that.  But I disagree that it's inexcusable because I'm prone to making mistakes when distracted.  More important is that this loss against is going to help one of my students as well as others who make mistakes due to distractions.  With that being said you in general don't want to play when distracted.  On the other hand there are times where you can't avoid distractions and must play like this.  Therefore the moral is that in those situations as well as in life what matters is ""the here and now"".  If you're playing and get distracted by other things that are difficult to drive off just focus on what's happening and where that concentration is needed.  Had I done that I wouldn't have missed the threat.  And this game more then likely would've been unfinished as opposed to lost."
1140,31,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Caro-Kann.  A fairly conservative but solid defence by Black.  Truth to tell my record against the Caro is not what you'd call stellar.
1141,31,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The usual response.  But also playable is 2.Nc3.  +++++++  There can also emerge from this opening a 'Demolition Derby' Gambit arising from a Grand Prix line: 1.e4 c6 2.f4!? d5  3.Nf3 dxe4  4.Ng5 Nf6  5.Bc4 Bg4 6.Qxg4!? Nxg4 7.Bxf7ch Kd7 8.Be6ch Kc7 9.Bxg4 ... White gets two minor pieces and a strong initiative for the Queen.
1142,31,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',The usual response.  Instead 2...d6 has been played as in a famous game from the 1950s M.Tal vs V. Simagin.
1143,31,3,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Advance Variation.  This was a favourite of Aron Nimzovitch though it didn't go as well for him as the analogous line in the French Defence (1.e4 e6  2.d54 d5  3.e5 ...).  Mischa Tal tried it also in his matches against M. Botvinnik.  It is by no means my favourite. I prefer the Panov-Botvinnik Attack 3.c4 but I thought I try something a bit more ... classical.
1144,31,4,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',In my view Black's best and most logical move.  In 1961 M. Botvinnik played 3...c5 in games 4 6 and 8 vs M. Tal.  After draws in the first two games Tal stomped all over him in the third outing.  Botvinnik thereafter switched to the bishop move.
1145,31,5,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The most often seen tries back in the day were the obvious looking 6.Bd3 and Tal's troglodyte attack by 6.h4.  The bishop exchange brought on by the former tended to leave White short of a valuable attacking asset; but 6...h5 was an apt response to the pawn thrust.  This move is a conservative development that keeps interest in the K-side but retains White' s'good' bishop - the one operating on the light squares whilst the centre pawns occupy the dark.

Black strikes at the base of the pawn chain at d4.  The motivation behind this is that after ...cxd4; cxd4 White is left with a weakness at d4 that has to be defended by pieces.  On the other hand dxc5 by White leaves the e5-pawn wanting supports.  +++++++ It is just possible Black might also be considering pushing the pawn to c4 with a view to striking at c3.  But that is a more difficult target to hit even if the first stage of the plan is successfully carried out.

At this point the GK engine give white a +1.56 lead - White has decidedly the better of it now.  I had already formed a plan that was to win me a pawn.
1162,31,22,bxa6,b'r2q1rk1/p2nbpp1/p3p1p1/3pP3/3P4/P3B3/1P1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',Two sets of doubled pawns!  But that on the g-file is insignificant and hardly weakens Black's K-side at all.  More of an asset than a liability. The isolated pair on the a-file is a bit more of a consideration vulnerable as they are.

Yet the engine has not yet pointed up any real mistake by Black (although in my view 14...Nb4 might not have been the best option Black had then available).   She's hanging in there trying to hold a fairly passive sort of position. White now establishes a pair of heavy pieces on the seventh rank.
1169,31,29,2Rc7,b'r2q1rk1/pQRnbpp1/4p1p1/3pP3/3P4/PN2B3/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',This sort of thing is usually a sure sign one has a fine game going.

The only defence for the knight was to move it but that exposed the bishop to immediate capture.  This rook move was the best defence available though it cost a pawn. 
1171,31,31,Ra8,b'r2q1rk1/Q1Rnbpp1/4p1p1/3pP3/3P4/PN2B3/1P3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Well played!  Instead 22...Rxb3 23.Rxd7 ... would still have lost Black a piece.

1174,31,34,Qb8,b'1q3rk1/3Rbpp1/2Q1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/Pr2B3/1P3PPP/5RK1 w - -',Desperate... but abandoning the bishop to its fate was unnecessary.  This is the first move actually called a mistake by the GK engine.  Although 25...Qe8 looked horribly passive it is not so easy for White to find a convincing follow up.  I would just about have to find 26.Bc1 to guarantee the lives of my extra pawns and then unravel the rest of my pieces and that move had not yet crossed my mind..  At the time I was imagining I'd play 26.Qc7 but after 26...Bd8 27.Qd6 Rxb2 Black would have been well back in the game despite the pawn less.  Her superior bishop and active rook would have been enough to stay at least roughly on terms.
1175,31,35,2Rxe7,b'1q3rk1/4Rpp1/2Q1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/Pr2B3/1P3PPP/5RK1 b - -',Now Black's game goes rapidly downhill.

1177,31,37,Rf8,b'1q3rk1/3Q1Rp1/4p1p1/3pP3/P2P4/4B3/5PPP/1r3RK1 w - -',No help - in fact it leaves White with a forced 3-move checkmate.  Better was carry on with a counter-attack plan (something I took care to calculate out you betcha): 29...Rxf1ch 30.Kxf1 Qb1ch 31.Ke2 Qc2ch 32.Kf3 ... and as 32...Qe4ch 33.kg3 simply ran Black out of checks 32...Rf8 33.Rxf8ch Kxf8 34.Qxe6 and wins.
1178,31,38,3Qg7#,b'1q3rk1/6QR/4p1p1/3pP3/P2P4/4B3/5PPP/1r3RK1 b - -',Choosing a solid unassuming defence Black stayed on reasonable terms for most of the game slipping a piece behind just at the moment when there was still much to play for.  Black best moments came during the course and immediate aftermath of White's attack on the Q-side that netted both a-pawns.  Two pawns behind Black still had chances to make life difficult to for White - perhaps to hold the game.  Often the difference in player strength come down down simply to ... consistency.
1179,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Carlsen also plays 1. e4 but somehow I have the feeling that when he is trying to win a game he is more likely to pick 1.d4. 
1180,32,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',With this move order White is maybe trying to avoid the main lines of the Gruenfeld which is the main opening of Caruana.

Of course White's main idea could be to play b4 to secure the c5 pawn and also to develop strong play on the queenside. Now White needs to look for a plan to hold the c5 pawn and to develop his bishop on c1 and knight on b1. 
1187,32,8,Be3,b'rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/5np1/p1Pp4/8/2P1BNP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',White found a nice plan with Be3–Qc1. This is not only giving White the possibility of playing Bh6 at some moment but also to bring the rook into the game with Rd1.

[An interesting try could have been 8...Ng4!? 9.Bd4 (After 9.Bd2 Na6 Black is perfectly fine.) 9...e5 Now the game is getting forced. 10.h3 exd4 11.hxg4 dxc3 12.Nxc3 Bxg4 White is a pawn up but the bishop pair should give Black very good chances to hold. 13.Qxd5 Qxd5 14.Nxd5 Na6 I think that maybe White is minimally better but objectively the game should end in a draw.]

1217,32,38,3e4,b'5r2/1p4bk/2nN4/2P1pp1p/4P2q/1PPR3P/6B1/2Q3K1 b - e3',I guess this move ends all of Black's hopes. The bishop on g7 is dead now and the black king is maybe even weaker than the white one. All White needs to do is to play b4–b5 and creat a passed pawn.
1218,32,39,3fxe4,b'5r2/1p4bk/2nN4/2P1p2p/4p2q/1PPR3P/6B1/2Q3K1 w - -',31...f4 is not any better.

1223,32,44,3e4,b'7k/1p4b1/2nN4/2P4p/1P2pr1q/2PR3P/4Q1B1/6K1 w - -',A practical decision. In a lost position Caruana at least tries to activate his pieces to have some theoretical chances for some tricks.
1224,32,45,3Rd5,b'7k/1p4b1/8/2PRn2p/1P2Nr1q/2P4P/4Q1B1/6K1 b - -',Once again everything is protected and the white pieces are controling the board. 
1225,32,46,3Kg8,b'6k1/1p4b1/8/2PRn2p/1P2Nr1q/2P4P/4Q1B1/6K1 w - -',This move already clearly shows that the game is over. 
1226,32,47,4bxc6,b'6k1/6b1/2P5/3Rnr1p/4N2q/2P4P/4Q1B1/6K1 b - -',So move 40 has been reached and White is 2 pawns up the black king could find himself under some serious attack soon and another big problem is the c6 pawn which just seems to be unstoppable.
1227,32,48,4Nd6,b'6k1/4q1b1/2PN4/3Rnr1p/8/2P4P/4Q1B1/6K1 b - -',White is bringing his knight to b5 to end what he started to queen the c-pawn.
1228,32,49,4Nb5,b'6k1/4q1b1/2P5/1N1Rn1rp/8/2P4P/4Q1B1/6K1 b - -',And the c7 move already cannot be stopped. 
1229,32,50,4Qe4+,b'3R4/6bk/2P1q3/1N2n1rp/4Q3/2P4P/6B1/6K1 b - -',Another accurate move. 
1230,32,51,4Ke1,b'2QR4/6bk/6r1/1N2n2p/4Q3/2P4P/1q4B1/4K3 b - -',White is a full queen up and after 49...Qa1 White has the simple 50.Rd1. We saw a very interesting and fighting game with a lot of different ideas. With this victory Carlsen grabbed another 1st place in one of the world's strongest tournaments.
1231,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So he starts conventionally.
1232,33,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And I also answer with my usual.
1233,33,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Ted usually answers with 2.Nf6 and then which ends up in an Open Sicilian.  Similar to my first game with elyhim I'm normally not used to that and wouldn't know how to handle the situation.  But I studied one or two annotations with charleshiggie where 2.c4 was played.  From that experience I know that we're talking about the Closed Sicilian.  And I don't have a problem since I know some of what Charles did.  But I start after my next move.
1234,33,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',That's because I want to continue conventionally with this move.  But after Ted's next move I know what do.
1235,33,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',As charleshiggie answered with this.
1236,33,5,g4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1P1P1/2N5/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq g3',"Fianchettoing but I was surprised to see this played.  My model used to be ""Expect to be surprised"" but as cplusplus11 that's not a good approach.  So I developed a different model which I learned from ION.  However he did not directly state this.  Instead it was implied but it was to learn how to handle different responses and things you might not be used to or did not anticipate.  This is one of those times because I have not seen this played from white before.  The only time is in the Basman Defense but that's with black since it starts off with 1.e4 g5"
1237,33,6,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P1P1P1/2N5/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Since I did not know what to do I tried something different.  As now the idea is doing something that I'm not comfortable which is the logic behind this fianchetto.  I've done it before but am not comfortable doing with something that I haven't see.  However my model is that thinking about what the contestants had to do on American Idol to be successful on that show.  They also had to get out of their comfort by trying different methods that they weren't used to.  It boils down to trial and error.  Were I to stay in my comfort I would've played 4...Nf6 to mobilize the K side at once.
1238,33,7,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2PPP1P1/2N5/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq d3',? I understand that he wanted to develop.  And the idea was also putting pressure on my Nc6.  But it is a mistake as this move is going to cost him a pawn and tempo since his N will come under fire.  Just about anything was better then this.  As white though I would've either developed my Bf1 or played 5.Nf3.  Like with black the idea would be to mobilize the K side and castle.
1239,33,8,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pp1p/p1np2p1/1N6/2PpP1P1/8/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? Figuring that I had gained tempo however I attack.  But I overlooked his next move however as this move gives him back the pawn.  Best was 6...e5.  In capturing however I will retake.  This forces him to play 8.Qxd4 to avoid losing a piece.  Normally we just expect it and doesn't seem important.  But there's more to it then meets the eye as it is significant.
1240,33,9,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p2pp1p/p2p2p1/8/2PQP1P1/8/PP3P1P/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',And it's the fact that Ted's Queen is forced into action before continuing development.  Consequently I will harrass it with my center pawn and use that time to continue developing.  That is an important concept of why we don't bring the Queen out too early.  In this case however there was no choice but the consequences are still the same.  
1241,33,10,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3pbp/p2p2p1/4p3/2P1P1P1/8/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',My idea of that development is the B as now it has a nice long flank where it covers the longest diagnol.  And it is why I also enjoy fianchetto's before that.
1242,33,11,1f4,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3pbp/p2p2p1/4p3/2P1PPP1/8/PP5P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',? Instead of continuing to develop Ted advances his f pawn.  Normally I just give it as a slight inaccuracy.  But in this context it's a mistake in my books because of what tactical-abyss emphasized in his Q sacs.  Just like when black takes the Knight in the Damino's Defense the idea is the same.  That's because this is his weakest pawn.  By playing this I'll remove his that by exchanging.  Consequently white is now in trouble.  In fact that is one way in which Joe forces those wins in his early Q sacs.  And I'm using a very similar tactic for this game.
1243,33,12,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/8/2P1PBP1/8/PP5P/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Preparing to castle by developing on the K side.
1244,33,13,1h3,b'r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/8/2P1PBP1/7P/PP6/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',? I was shocked to see Ted play this since he hasn't castled yet and his K side is not developed.  More importantly this loses a pawn.  With those two being said best was 12.Bd3 developing whilst keeping his e4 protected.  Unlike before after my next move I'm not going to allow Ted to to get back a pawn.  That's because there will be no more lucky mistakes from me.
1245,33,14,1Ne2,b'r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p2p2p1/8/2P1nBP1/7P/PP2N3/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',?? This also develops but I view it as an inaccuracy.  First his Knight is now crammed here which I will take advantage of.  More importantly he could've pinned my Ne4 after which I'd have no idea what to do from there.  Better would've been 13.Nf3 or 13.Bg2.  Best however would've been 13.Qe7 which pins the N.  After which I'd be clinging.  Although I don't like it for a similar reason to what I mentioned I'd answer with 13...Qe7 to protect my N and break the pin.  But this move makes things quite easy for me as I'll treat as though black took the N in the Damiano's with the same responses.  But this move loses his right to castle gets his King exposed and loses a piece.  So it is in my books the losing blunder because as noted I'm not going to allow him counterplay. 
1246,33,15,1Qh4+,b'r1b1k2r/1p3pbp/p2p2p1/8/2P1nBPq/7P/PP2N3/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',"But I was keeping in mind that Ted's position was cramped and thus took advantage of that.  Although there's actually a little more to this story that's how I was thinking.  The reason being is that white can no longer castle which is why he should've done so earlier.  BTW I'm not trying to be pompous as it might sound but I'm believe it or not basing my commentary on what Jack told Ted.  It was last week after a similar mistake and he Mr. Stockel said ""You used to castle Ted.  Why didn't you do that in your game with Joe?""  He was pointing out how Ted wrong.  I kept that combined with the GM game in mind since both failed to castle on time and were punished.  The same is true here."

1250,33,19,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/1p3p1p/p2p2pb/8/2P3P1/7P/PPK1B3/R6R w - -',Without an immeidate mate I calculate what to do.  The idea is to force a mate.  So I'm doing something similar to what bhidragon did in our rated game.  It's adding another attacker.  The plan is to get my Rook mobile and move it down to the fourth rank where there is more pressure against Ted's monarch.  The idea is that my developed pieces are what's targetting what will continue to target his exposed King.
1251,33,20,2Rad1,b'r1b2rk1/1p3p1p/p2p2pb/8/2P3P1/7P/PPK1B3/3R3R b - -',This is the only thing I did not know.  It boils down to which Rook.  I believe it was this but unlike with other games it does not matter since my next move is the same.

Organizing both Bishops (or bishop pair) and both Rooks would make it very difficult for him to prevent mate.  And doing so would put a lot of compromises on his position due to my edge.  Again I'm just calculating but could be things that I am overlooking as well.  But the plan is the same by organizing Bishops and Rooks for a nasty attack due to the Kingside being weakened.
1253,33,22,2Rxd6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3p1p/p2R2p1/8/2P2bP1/7P/PPK1B3/7R b - -',?? But this is Ted's final blunder.  Feeling that white compensated for lost material he took my pawn. 
1254,33,23,2Bxd6,b'r1b2rk1/1p3p1p/p2b2p1/8/2P3P1/7P/PPK1B3/7R w - -',And I took his Rook.  After this Ted resigned.  The final blunder was 21.Rxd6  But he got himself by not following the general guidelines which I was then able to exploit by harrassing his Queen removing his weakest pawn and taking away his right to castle which also lost a piece.  So as usual the moral of this story is to develop control the center and get the King to safety.  White's failure to do that is what led to this outcome.
1255,34,0,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Generally Nc6 is not ideal for Black because it impedes the c pawn.

After Kxg3 the h pawn sails through to promotion because the Black's K controls g7 and the B controls the promotion square.  Black played the endgame very patiently and carefully.

Yet again I get struck down by passivitis and my Class C opponent brews up a really nasty attack which leaves my King Henry shivering under the familiar dark dark shadow of Old Matey.  Somehow my opponent takes his foot off the gas and gives me much needed breathing space which enables my queen Glenda to mount a lone wolf counter-attack on King Rick.  It is all hope chess but luckily Rick overlooks a saving move which would have kept his attack going.  Rick's mistake however ensures that his attack is stopped short and never to go again when his old King died.  So how did this happen?  Well read on. "

In the late 1970s Karpov Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White with Nf3 often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3 Qd2 and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre remove White's rook from the diagonal and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.

1432,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game is the main claim to fame of both Hamppe and Meitner and has been reprinted widely. The variation of the Vienna Game it uses was named the Hamppe–Meitner Variation in honour of the two players. The game was played in the 19th-century Romantic style in which rapid development and attack were considered the most effective way to win where many gambits and counter-gambits were offered (and not accepting them was considered slightly ungentlemanly) and where material was often held in contempt. These games with their rapid attacks and counterattacks are often entertaining to review even if some of the moves would no longer be considered the best by today's standards. In the game Black sacrifices huge amounts of material to drive the white king to his back rank and attempt to force checkmate but White spectacularly manages to force a draw by perpetual check.
1433,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So the game start conventionally enough.

1436,39,4,Na4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/N3P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Better would be 3.Nf3! d6 4.d4 and White has a slight advantage. The move is premature; although many lines of the Vienna have White trying to obtain the bishop pair with this move the bishop can still retreat to e7 and the knight is not ideally placed at a4.
1437,39,5,Bxf2+,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3P3/8/PPPP1bPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The quiet 3...Be7 would be better and less risky especially since the move played may in fact lead to a win for White with best play. A bishop sacrifice is commonly seen in reply to an early knight attack in various lines including this one.
