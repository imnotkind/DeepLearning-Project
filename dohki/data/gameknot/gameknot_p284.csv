15,1,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I like to play safe and passively in the opening so that I have a solid position.
16,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This has transposed into King's Indian Defense which is a very strong hypermodern opening. Black wants to develop and castle quickly instead of worrying about the center. Space is the least important when evaluating a position. Pawn structure and development are the most important. One side can have a big space advantage but it isn't worth anything when the other side is better developed and is solid.
17,1,2,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',Most players play e5 here where dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4! usually favors Black but I prefer the c5-break since e5 O-O Nc6 d5 Ne7 Ne1 usually favors White.
18,1,3,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White can go into a Benoni-type position with d5 but by ignoring my central break White usually wants to go into Maroczy Bind which can transpose from different openings.
19,1,4,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The Accelerated Dragon from the Sicilian could reach this position and also a lot of different Nf3 openings. The Maroczy Bind is feared by some players but I am happy playing against it since I am familiar with its principles. White wants to consolidate and slowly grind me down so I need to break the bind before White can consolidate
20,1,5,Bc6,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2bp1np1/8/2PBP3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',I am already challenging White's center so f3 is needed here.
21,1,6,a5,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/2bp1np1/p7/2PBP3/2N2P2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 w - a6',I thought about Nd7 here but I was a little worried about b4. This move doesn't weaken my position very much and it grabs some queenside territory.
22,1,7,Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nppbp/2bp2p1/p7/2PBP3/1PN2P2/P2QB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I think White's best move is Bxg7 Kxg7 Qd4  which goes into the line played in the actual game except that I would be down a tempo.
23,1,8,Qb6,b'r4rk1/1p1npp1p/1qbp2p1/p7/2PQP3/1PN2P2/P3B1PP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black usually has the better endgame in Maroczy Bind so White shouldn't allow me to force trades
24,1,9,Kg7,b'r4r2/1p2ppkp/1nbp2p1/p7/2P1P3/1PN2P2/P3B1PP/2RR2K1 w - -',I couldn't find a clear plan here so I prepared to bring my king to the center in the ensuing endgame.
25,1,10,1Nd5,b'r4r2/1p2ppkp/1nbp2p1/p2N4/2P1P3/1P3P2/P3B1PP/2RR2K1 b - -',I personally don't think White should've allowed the trade. If White had played passively then I would've tried breaking with Rc8 Bd7 a4 undermining the pawn structure
26,1,11,1Bxd5,b'r4r2/1p2ppkp/1n1p2p1/p2b4/2P1P3/1P3P2/P3B1PP/2RR2K1 w - -',Trading with the knight is bad since my bishop is garbage by trading with the bishop I get a knight vs. bishop imbalance where my jumping knight is more powerful than White's bad bishop.
27,1,12,2Ke3,b'2r2r2/1p2p1kp/1n1p2p1/p2P1p2/4P3/1P2KP2/P3B1PP/2RR4 b - -',White is following the rule about bringing the king to the center in the endgame but he really overdid it in this game. The king doesn't have a role yet.
28,1,13,Kf6,b'2r2r2/1p1np2p/3p1kp1/p2P4/3KPp2/1P1B1P2/P5PP/2RR4 w - -',My position was only slightly better a few moves ago but now I like my position a lot better since White's king is horribly placed now
29,1,14,2Bb1,b'2r5/1p2p2p/3p1kp1/p2Pn3/3KPp2/1P3P2/P5PP/1B1R4 b - -',Not really a good move I wasn't going to trade my good knight for that crappy bishop
30,1,15,2Rf1,b'2r5/4p2p/3p1k2/pp1Pn1p1/3KPp2/1P3P2/P5PP/1B3R2 b - -',White offered a draw here since he doesn't seem to be able to make progress but I just need a bit more progress to win this. White's horribly placed king will lose the game for him
31,1,16,2b4,b'2r5/4p2p/3p1k2/p2Pn1p1/1p1KPp2/1P3P2/P5PP/1B3R2 w - -',Now White is dead I will play Rc3 for an unstoppable mating attack
32,1,17,Rc3,b'8/4p2p/3p1k2/p2Pn1p1/1p1KPp2/1Pr2P2/P5PP/1B2R3 w - -',There's no hope for White now try to find the mate.
33,1,18,Nc6+,b'8/4p2p/2np1k2/p2P2p1/1p1KPp2/1Pr2P2/P5PP/1B1R4 w - -',Nc6!! finishes off White and the game is over
34,1,19,Ke7,b'8/4k2p/2Pp4/p2Kp1p1/1p2Pp2/1Pr2P2/P5PP/1B1R4 w - -',White resigned as there is no way to stop Rc5# this goes to show that king in the center is not always a good rule to follow it usually is good to put the king in the center during the endgame just don't get mated!
35,1,20,3c7,b'8/2P1k2p/3p4/p2Kp1p1/1p2Pp2/1Pr2P2/P5PP/1B1R4 b - -',
36,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Coaching game ; this annotation is for the benefit of rebelsnake. But I hope it can benefit others too.
37,2,1,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
38,2,2,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Not worrying about that pawn. Nxp would be followed by Re1 and white regains the pawn with the initiative.
39,2,3,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Protects the e5 pawn and might threaten to take at e4. But the knight at c6 is pinned.
40,2,4,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',Naturally. Since white is ahead in terms of king safety he must try action in the center and open up the play.
41,2,5,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A good move unpinning the knight. But Be7 was possible (d5 being met with a6 - white wins a pawn but it may be difficult to protect).
42,2,6,a6,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Finally black plays this the natural move (at move 3).
43,2,7,Bxc6,b'r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1Bp1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',White goes for the simple plan of winning a pawn.
44,2,8,Nxe4,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp4/4P3/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',A dangerous decision. pxp was much safer.
45,2,9,exd6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bP4/8/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Because now the black knight is pinned.
46,2,10,Bxd6,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Excellent. Black is now closer to being able to castle and the black bishops are very well placed. Black has managed the opening rather well except for this pinned knight.
47,2,11,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',A mistake that turns out right. But first consider the (bad) alternative :      10 Ng5 to take advantage of the pinned knight and capture it. After black plays pawn to f5 if now white plays f3 which seems to win the knight black has Bc5  (Kh1 is answered by QxQ...RxQ...Nf2 and black wins while Kf1 is answered by Bb5 ).     But the best move was probably 10 Qd4. I underestimated the best reply white could have made...
48,2,12,1Qe7,b'r3k2r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',...which was Bb4 as my opponent pointed out. But he made the wrong choice.
49,2,13,1Nxe4,b'r3k2r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',Now after black recaptures we have the same manoeuvre as before but this time white will be able to capture the Bishop at e4 without any complications.
50,2,14,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Here black seems to have lost the thread of the game. He should have recaptured the knight.  After all a piece is a piece. But there is a trap involved here. White must be careful.
51,2,15,1Nxd6+,b'2kr3r/1pp1qppp/p1bN4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',On a careless move such as b3 for instance black would have played Bh2  and won the white Queen!
52,2,16,1Qxd6,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1bq4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Here black could have tried RxB. It would be easy for white to go wrong with RxQ (followed by RxQ  for black and if Re1 black plays BxN! with a dead draw in perspective (an ending with bishops of opposite colors is very difficult to win).
53,2,17,1Qxd6,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1bQ4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Not taking any chances. When you're ahead in material exchange pieces and you'll wind up with an easy win. Of course one must be confident on his ability to win a won game in the ending.
54,2,18,1Bf4,b'2k4r/1pp2ppp/p1br4/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White must still follow the right track. This is the natural move as it attacks the rook while developing the bishop (and freeing the rook at a1).
55,2,19,1Rdd8,b'2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1b5/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Rd7 was better : Protecting the second rank (the natural place for white's rooks) while preparing for a possible doubling of black's rooks on the d file.
56,2,20,1Re7,b'2kr3r/1pp1Rppp/p1b5/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',The only move of the game requiring no thinking at all. A rook on the 7th rank is the paradise of the chess player.
57,2,21,1Bd7,b'2kr3r/1ppbRppp/p7/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Here Rd7 was a little better forcing white's hand but not much can be done now to save black.
58,2,22,1Ne5,b'2kr3r/1ppbRppp/p7/4N3/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Rd1 was also possible but I liked the possibilities of this move.
59,2,23,1Bf5,b'2kr3r/1pp1Rppp/p7/4Nb2/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',R(h)-f8 or Be6 were better.
60,2,24,1Nxf7,b'2kr3r/1pp1RNpp/p7/5b2/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',The cherry on the sunday.
61,2,25,1Rd7,b'2k4r/1pprRNpp/p7/5b2/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',But this makes it worse. White now wins a full rook.
62,2,26,Be6,b'2k4N/1pp3pp/p3b3/8/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',The only small compensation is that white's knight is stranded in the corner but with white's material advantage it is to no avail.
63,2,27,Kd7,b'7N/1ppk2pp/p3b3/8/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Illustrates a peculiar kind of mistake. Black's d7 pawn looks well protected here. 
64,2,28,2Bxc7,b'7N/1pBk2pp/p3b3/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',But it is not since the king must remain protect his bishop. Of course here black could now play Bxa2 but after d3 the bishop is in a net the rook will come and capture it and the white knight is freed.   So black rightfully gives up.

88,4,5,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White must not have realized the chance to expand the centre and plays a passive move.

The queen manoeuvres (27...Qf7ch! 28....Qe6! 29...Qe4!) have left her well centralised and the Q-side majority is still sufficiently mobile. I'm not saying Black is winning here but Black has the initiative and the positional edge at the moment.

Black probably can't contemplate ...c5 yet so a king move is indicated. Can he run the gauntlet of the f-file? 30...Kf7 31.Qf2ch Ke7 32.Qf6ch Kd7 33.Qf7ch!? Qe7 and White suddenly finds his b-pawn ""en prise"". However it seems White might be able to conjure enough counterplay by 34.Qg8. Maybe Black has to try and keep White pinned down with something like 30...Qe7 protecting his own vulnerable points whilst attacking White's and then to look to improving the king's position.

Qh2# White has no checks available so 37.Kh3 is indicated. Now Black can force a draw if so desired by 37...Qa3ch (38.Kh4 Qd6 or perpetual checks along the 1st and 2nd ranks). A more aggressive (and possibly more risky) plan is this: 37...gxh5 38.gxh5 Kf7 39.Qb7ch Qe7 hoping for 40.Qxc6?? Qe6ch! 41.Qxe6 Kxe6 when Black's far distant majority should carry the day: 42.g6 hxg6 43.hxg5 (43.h6 just gives white passed pawns on both flanks) 43...b4 44.Kg3 a5 45.Kf3 a4 46.Ke3 b3 wins.

149,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',An invitation for a tactical battle is made. White controls f5 and d5. The pawn is not protected. The bishop line is opened for piece development.
150,6,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The start of a Sicilian opening. Counter attacking the center using the flank pawn. Black controls b4 and d4. The pawn is unprotected. The idea is to trade flank for center pawn by d2-d4 c5xd4 or influence the center if no trade is offered. The queen line is opened. Note an important feature of the move c7-c5 is that the knight can be developed behind the pawn.
151,6,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The king knight is developed which is good preparation for 0-0. The knight controls e5 and has a little influence on d4 which offers strength to the move d2-d4. White has a gain in piece development specifically because of developing king side pieces.
152,6,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black continues the flank pressure on the center while developing a piece. The knight adds control to d4 of +4 points or 2 pieces. This will balance the equation if d2-d4 and will result in an even material trade but will result in a positional gain of flank vs center pawn to the favor of black. There is an imbalance of piece development vs positional development in this opening by design.
153,6,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White chooses the most common reply. The pawn at d4 is covered by both queen and knight. An exchange of pawns is expected because white exerts control over much of the center and black will need to seek balance in central control by eliminating the d4 pawn.
154,6,5,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The standard Nf3xd4 is the usual move but here white tries a gambit pawn move with the idea of gaining even greater piece development. The idea is an interesting diversion to the main lines. The plan is d4xc3 Nb1xc3 !? with development but a weakening of center control that would have been offered by the c pawn.
155,6,6,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',There are choices of moves available here including e7-e5 which helps to develop pieces. But the idea of a7-a6 is to prevent the c3 knight and f1 bishop from obtaining the use of b5 which in turn keeps the c6 knight and d7 pawn free. This move provides some resistance against piece development by white.
156,6,7,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White develops a piece in preparation for 0-0 by Bf1-c4 ?! but this move carries the risk of losing a tempo from b7-b5. White may be betting that black will be determined to develop pieces before counter attacking. Perhaps white calculates b7-b5 Bc4-d5 e7-d6 Bxc6 dxc6 Qd1xd8 Kxd8 which gives some advantage to white because of the black king is in the open and the endgame is not quite in play yet. The position appears about equal positionally but black has a slight material gain. The bishop and pawn offer +4 points control of d5 and also targets f7 as a possible future attack point. The bishop is unprotected.
157,6,8,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move works against the bishop and against any tactical ideas found by Nf3-g5 with f7 as the target of knight and bishop. This move opens the king bishop line to assist in developing pieces.
158,6,9,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White has no fear of a counter attack and continues to develop pieces. The bishop has some control of e5 and the threatening square g5. White is obtaining a great deal of influence and control of the center but this is expected in this opening in which black shifts to attack later. The bishop is unprotected the second piece to be so and could pose a potential problem.
159,6,10,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p2pp/p1n1pp2/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black shifts from an expected developing move and counters the control of e5. It is interesting to note that even without gains in piece development that black is in no danger from attack. It is true that black has a reserved position but it is not necessarily limited because there are no pawn blockades in use by white. Black is playing defensively. This pawn move takes control of g5 and e5 from the f3 knight. Note that white can not develop either knight forward to the 5th rank. Petrosian is an influence here.

161,6,12,b5,b'r1bqkbnr/3p2pp/p1n1pp2/1p2P3/2B2B2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq b6',Black begins a counter attack on the previously mentioned weakly placed bishop.
162,6,13,Bd3,b'r1bqkbnr/3p2pp/p1n1pp2/1p2P3/5B2/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',The choice for this move is based on Bc4-b3 Nc6-a5 attacking and gaining the bishop to secure a 2 bishop + knight vs 2 knight + bishop advantage. The move is good because it keeps the bishop centralized. The position may be attacked by Nc6-b4 driving the bishop to a less useful square but that is a chance to take.
163,6,14,g5,b'r1bqkbnr/3p3p/p1n1pp2/1p2P1p1/5B2/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq g6',Black persists in the counter attack giving white no quarter.

Black still needs to work out some piece development but notice how space is becoming more plentiful on the black side of the board which means more mobility of pieces.
168,6,19,1Qd2,b'r1bqkbnr/3p4/p1n1p3/1p2Pppp/8/2NB1NBP/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',White makes a move that is likely based on the pawn storm. The idea is 0-0-0 to get the king out of the center and away from the storm which is a good idea but the more optimal place for the queen should be c2 due to the potential for an attack on the black diagonal by Bf8-a6 and also h5-h4. Also the queen and bishop have strength together.

Black needs to limit the white pieces mobility while white needs to gain mobility and enhance protection of the king. The positional evaluation is -\+

The bishop at g7 and the knight are both in a direct line of attack from the rook. The move also prevents the queen from using the e3 square in the event of moving the rook from e1.

There were many problems presented on the board which required some creative solutions. A good learning experience to see how the dynamics of opening choices unfold and where positional and material gains are made. I believe that good piece placement makes a difference but also applying a plan that works against the opponent plan goes a long way. I want to thank my opponent for a great game!

Ever had a game where your opponent makes the moves you hope he will? It happened to me in this game and I got the chance to go on a king hunt that was really exhilirating (at least for this class 'C' patzer:) My opponent gets his king stuck in the center and advancing and I'm able to really make him squirm. I hope you enjoy:) As usual I play my favorite 1. d4.
220,9,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Along with 1...d5 the most popular response to 1. d4.

222,9,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Hmmm....perhaps my opponent is trying to steer into some line of the QGD.
223,9,4,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here is the first instance of black playing what I was hoping for. I block with bishop he takes I take with my Nb1 and if he castles  I have the opportunity for a big center.
224,9,5,Bxd2+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1bPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays as I was hoping for:)
225,9,6,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',? I was so hoping he would do that. I now have the chance to pounce in the center big time. Much better for black was 5...d5.
226,9,7,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ e3',As planned. Now if black plays d5 I can push e5 and put his Nf6 on a much more passive square.
227,9,8,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ d6',It's weird.....I think it and he does it. Sometimes the stars just align I guess. At this point I feel that I will be able to establish a solid threat on his castled position after Qc2 and Bd3.
228,9,9,Nfd7,b'rnbq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/2PP4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Once again black moves to the square I was hoping for. 7...Nh5 may have held more promise though. If I chase the knight by 8. g4 the knight can move to f4 safely and I may have had defensive issues on my kingside. I'm not sure I would have played g4 in that case but I certainly would have considered it. As for the actual position I'm feeling pretty good. I can now safely push c5 and start turning the screws on preventing black's development.
229,9,10,f6,b'rnbq1rk1/pppn2pp/4pp2/2PpP3/3P4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Good idea - black sees the need to open things up and threatens control of the f file.

I suggested that if it was his intent to play b6 he should have just gone ahead and played it immediately as the text restricts his Nb8 and just wastes time. It is interesting to note now that the reader should keep his eyes on black's Nb8.

235,9,16,1b6,b'rnbq1rk1/p2n2pp/1pp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black proceeds with his idea of b6 to start chipping away at my pawns but it is a late attempt. I think Na6-c7 Ba6 or Qe8 or Qe7 were better attempts to develop.

I have my first real doubts as to the sanity of playing Qg6 so blatently. I'm not worried about black snagging the e pawn - it's black playing Qe8 that has me worried. I continue to send telepathic signals convincing my opponent that Qe8 is a BAD move;)

248,9,29,2Kd6,b'rn1q4/p5Q1/b1pkprB1/3pn1N1/8/8/P2N1PPP/2R1K2R w K -',? This was probably the critical losing move. 22...Kb6 would have probably bought black some dearly needed time.
249,9,30,2Nde4+,b'rn1q4/p5Q1/b1pkprB1/3pn1N1/4N3/8/P4PPP/2R1K2R b K -',! My favorite move of the game as it forces a capture which will allow me to play Ne4  forcing black to advance his king or play Nd3  (which is easily sidestepped) or Bd3. After any of those moves I play Rd1 and black is in a world of hurt.
250,9,31,2dxe4,b'rn1q4/p5Q1/b1pkprB1/4n1N1/4p3/8/P4PPP/2R1K2R w K -',Forced.

I don't find fault with his last move as he was in some serious time trouble (he had about 5 seconds left). This is one of my favorite OTB games ever. The sheer number of pins and their veracity was something I don't run across every day. It may seem like a rather mundane game to a lot of you stronger players (I know both sides made plenty of mistakes) but for patzers like me it sure was a beauty. Several of the players in this tournament hung around afterwards to compare games and this one was awarded the ""Freaking Brutal"" award:) I hope you enjoyed it! - Thomas"
266,10,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The caro-kann is not so popular these days. Most modern player prefer to have a sharper defence like the Sicilan. 
267,10,1,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"This is the Karpov varation or smlyov varation. Black plays nd7 in order to play Nf6 without having to mess up the kingside pawns. It also prepares the eventually counterattacking ...d5 or ...e5. 

Also this avoids the classical mainline which has traditionally give white a superior edge. The main line continues 4. ...Bf5 8. Ng3...Bg6 6. H4 h6 7. Nf3 Nf6

The positional basis of 7. ...Nf6 is that black tempts white into playing Ne5 and then after the retreat 8. ...Bh7 black tries to prove that the well placed Knight on e5 is a target. Traditional plans for black to undermine the e5 knight are c6-c5 or attacking it directly with moves like bd6 Nb-d7 and Qc7. 

This follows the general chess principle that a peice does not control the square it is sitting on. So by going to e5 the knight has given up control of e5 and d4. "

5. Ne2 Ngf6 6. Ng3 e6 is an interesting idea for white ( Romanishin vs. Petrosian USSR 1979)"
269,10,3,exf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is a bold move on my part but I recognized that white was not in the mood to fight. So I transposed into the Korchonoi system with fxe6 which in my experience is a very resourceful line. The main advantage of the Korchonoi system is that black achieves free and rapid development. As well black has great chances of controlling the e file. Finally Black has an extra pawn on the king-side. I like blacks pawn structure on the king-side because it can be very defensive. In order for white to break thrown Black's king-side pawns he must sacrifice a piece. 
270,10,4,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nqppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Here Black gains more control of the e file with Qe7 as white dare not exchange the queens. Because after Bxe7 black will have greater control of the file and make the task of playing f5 easier. 
271,10,5,Nf8,b'r1b1kn1r/pp2qppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',The idea of this knight move is to eventually create counter play on f5. It is risky but such manoeuvres can throw your opponent off a bit. More solid is g6 with the idea of playing f5. After black aims to play Nf6 to attack d4.
272,10,6,1Nf5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2qppp/2pb1pn1/5N2/3P4/3BB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',this is a good exchange for white as black need his peices. One of the main strategic motifs for white in the Korchonoi system is to symplify and go into the endgame as quickly as possible.

336,11,53,2Qd7,b'6k1/3q1rpp/1Q1P4/4rp2/8/P5PP/5P2/RR4K1 w - -',Dave declines and the game is moving into a new phase now...I still think I have the advantage on board position at this stage.  I control about 12 or 13 squares on his side of the board to his 5 or 6
337,11,54,2Rbd1,b'6k1/3q1rpp/1Q1P4/4rp2/8/P5PP/5P2/R2R2K1 b - -',It looks like the next flash point is the advanced pawn on d6...so I move to shore up an advanced position. 
338,11,55,2Re6,b'6k1/3q1rpp/1Q1Pr3/5p2/8/P5PP/5P2/R2R2K1 w - -',Dave agrees and moves to make the battle decisive in his favor.
339,11,56,3a4,b'6k1/3q1rpp/1Q1Pr3/5p2/P7/6PP/5P2/R2R2K1 b - -',When attacked in the imiddle counter on the flanks...so here goes.

341,11,58,3h4,b'6k1/3q1rp1/1Q1Pr3/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R2R2K1 b - -',I move to defend the flank
342,11,59,3Rff6,b'6k1/3q2p1/1Q1Prr2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R2R2K1 w - -',Dave moves to attack the  middle. 
343,11,60,3Qb8+,b'1Q4k1/3q2p1/3Prr2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R2R2K1 b - -',Outnumbered I force him to defend his King. 
344,11,61,3Kh7,b'1Q6/3q2pk/3Prr2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R2R2K1 w - -',Easy..
345,11,62,3Rdc1,b'1Q6/3q2pk/3Prr2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R1R3K1 b - -',I abandon the pawn and decide to execute an end around attack. 
346,11,63,3Rexd6,b'1Q6/3q2pk/3r1r2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R1R3K1 w - -',The pawn dies immediately 
347,11,64,3Rc8,b'1QR5/3q2pk/3r1r2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R5K1 b - -',This move creates an exchange that leads to the end game position with my one point advantage playing a huge role. 
348,11,65,3Rd1+,b'1QR5/3q2pk/5r2/5p1p/P6P/6P1/5P2/R2r2K1 w - -',The Castle exchange is first

351,11,68,3f4,b'1QR5/6pk/5r2/7p/P4p1P/6P1/5PK1/3q4 w - -',I place him in Check

421,13,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays a covert response which can translate into many openings. Controls d5 and e4. The knight is protected.
422,13,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',A flank aproach to controlling the center b5 and d5 squares. Unprotected piece that has only e7-e5 to contend with for an attacking move. This move would however provide a trade of flank for center pawn. The opening is taking on an Indian flavor.
423,13,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Heading towards what could be a Nimzo Indian opening but other openings can spring from this position. Contests control of d5 controls f5. Controls some of the center from a defensive position.
424,13,4,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',E00 Queens Pawn Anti-Nimzo-Indian Opening to this move. Typically d7-d5 is played next. This move controls b4 which prevents Bf8-b4+. White controls more center has more space has some defensive measures in place but lacks piece development.
425,13,5,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',A flank attack on a center pawn. Contends control of b4. Blockades c4. Threatens c5xd4. Offers d4xc5 Bf8xc5 with an attack on f2 - but with the bishop susceptable to a b2-b4 attack. The pawn is protected by the bishop. Black is fighting for the center. Opens up the Queen check line of Qd8-a5+. White should respond with Nf3 or e3 to capture back with a piece that is resistant to attack by the B8 knight.
426,13,6,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/2p5/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black takes advantage of quick development and moves towards king safety. The bishop appears awkward here but does offer an attack later via Qd8-c7 with an attack directed towards h2 where white must presumedly castle. Its is an ambitious move but I feel Be7 is better. Maybe because of white gaining space by d4xc5 Bd6xc5 b2-b4 Bc5-e7. Rate as ?! and = because white can make positional gains but black has a lead in piece development. There is the debate of expansion of space for white verses piece development for black. There is an imbalance between the applied strategies.
427,13,7,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/2p5/2PP4/P2BP3/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White moves for piece development instead of continued pawn expansion by the previously mentioned line that chases the bishop at d6. The imbalance shifts some but black still maintains a lead in piece development.
428,13,8,cxd4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/8/2Pp4/P2BP3/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black attempts to take away some of the protected control of the center from white. The result is after e3xd4 the pawn at d4 is not protected and contention of f4 is more balanced with B vs B instead of B vs P. It is true that d4 is safe for white for the moment and white still has more space and a 2 point pawn front on the 4th vs the 1 point pawn presence at e6. The move 0-0 looks better. Rate +\= because black drops the momentum of developing for a pawn move.
429,13,9,Qb6,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q1bpn2/8/2PP4/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black launches a queen attack but overlooks a tactic by white. Rate as ?? and +\- because black will lose a piece from this move.

432,13,12,Qxc5,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2q5/8/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Black does end up at only -1 point but pieces can accomplish more than undeveloped pawns so the trade-off of the bishop for the 2 pawns is not beneficial tactically positionally or materially. The center is open which provides white much freedom for the bishops and the black queen is an unprotected target for the bishops.
433,13,13,Be3,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2q5/8/P2BB3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White takes advantage by attacking to gain tempo and developing a piece.
434,13,14,Qe5,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4q3/8/P2BB3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Black attempts to attack the b2 pawn while pinning the bishop. The move is not successful and only helps white to develop and gain tempo. Rate as ? because the move helps white to develop and because the queen has moved to a vulnerable square because of Ng1-f3.
435,13,15,1Nc3,b'rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4q3/8/P1NBB3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',This move blocks the threat of Qe5xb2 while developing a piece. White stands better.
436,13,16,1d5,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pq3/8/P1NBB3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq d6',Black has forgotten about the king and continues to pursue an attack by hoping to obtain a fork by d5-d4. Rate this move as ?! because it has limited potential as an attack while it does gain some central control.
437,13,17,1Nf3,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pq3/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White continues to develop this time with tempo gained by attacking the queen. White is 2 moves from a fully developed back rank.
438,13,18,1Qd6,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/3p4/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black hopes to push the pawn to obtain a fork but the threat is stronger than the execution.
439,13,19,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/3p4/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White castles for development and safety. The fork is not a serious threat.
440,13,20,1b6,b'rnb1k2r/p4ppp/1p1qpn2/3p4/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black is still working for an attack but positionally is standing badly with an unprotected queen and lack of piece development. The idea is to follow with Bb8-b7 to apply pressure down the long diagonal.
441,13,21,1Nb5,b'rnb1k2r/p4ppp/1p1qpn2/1N1p4/8/P2BBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White attacks the queen with the idea of Ra1-c1 to support the move Nb5-c7+ and a winning fork. Rate as ! for the concept.
442,13,22,1Qd7,b'rnb1k2r/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/1N1p4/8/P2BBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black sees the move Nc7+ but does not see the assisting move of Ra1-c1.
443,13,23,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/1N1p4/8/P2BBN2/1P3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',Black obtains king safety at the expense of the rook. There is no better move.
444,13,24,1Nc7,b'rnb2rk1/p1Nq1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/8/P2BBN2/1P3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Rate as ! for the continuation of the idea started at move 13.
445,13,25,1Nxa8,b'Nn3rk1/pb1q1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/8/P2BBN2/1P3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',White transitions from +1 to +3 points securing a material edge. Rate as +\- because of the material advantage combined with a positional advantage gained by better piece placement.
446,13,26,1Qc2,b'bn3rk1/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/8/P2BBN2/1PQ2PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',White begins to setup an attack on the king by targeting h7. The knight at f6 will have to be eliminated to free the protection of h7.
447,13,27,1d4,b'bn3rk1/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3p4/P2BBN2/1PQ2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',This move does not accomplish anything and is easily refuted. Black may have been thinking Be3xd4 Ba8xf3 g2xf3 Qd7xd4 winning a bishop - not a very good or likely line.
448,13,28,Bxg2,b'1n3rk1/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3N4/P2BB3/1PQ2PbP/2R2RK1 w - -',Black overestimates the success of this move hoping Kg1xg2 Qd7-d5+ Kg2-g1 and continued manouvers using the queen and knight in an attempt at mate.
449,13,29,1Kxg2,b'1n3rk1/p2q1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3N4/P2BB3/1PQ2PKP/2R2R2 b - -',White now stands very much better materially and even with the risky appearance of the king on g2 is fine positionally. Rate +\- with +6 points.
450,13,30,2f3,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/3q4/3N4/P2BBP2/1PQ3KP/2R2R2 b - -',The refutation.
451,13,31,2Ng4,b'1n3rk1/p4ppp/1p2p3/3q4/3N2n1/P2BBP2/1PQ3KP/2R2R2 w - -',Black aims for Ng4xe3 with a grand fork of K Q R. The pin prevents the capture of the knight. Not a bad try but for the bishop can escape while maintaining control of the e3 square.
452,13,32,Nd7,b'5rk1/p2n1ppp/1p2p3/3q4/3N2n1/P2B1P2/1PQ3KP/2R2RB1 w - -',Black moves another piece into the fray but unfortunately it is a knight travelling from the opposite side of the board and will not gain ground quickly enough.
453,13,33,2Be4,b'5rk1/p2n1ppp/1p2p3/3q4/3NB1n1/P4P2/1PQ3KP/2R2RB1 b - -',There is no move that will afford black an advantage. Black resigns. If Qd5-g5 in hopes of a revealed attack by moving the knight then f3xg4 Qg5xg4+ Kg2-h1 and the attack is over. Win 1-0.
454,14,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',With c4 my opponent tells me that he likes slower more positional games.

The idea behind this move is to gain space on the queenside since black has made no move in the center.  This keeps with the hypermodern approach."

He should have tried to use the extra material and open the center luckily for me though I had him completely concerned about my side of the board.  (The joys of playing 15xx players!)

476,15,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I personally don't like the symmetrical reply since now Black doesn't have any imbalanced advantages when White has the tempo.
477,15,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Baker is an incredibly strong attacker so he often plays gambit openings like this and crushes his opponent quickly.
478,15,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black should just take the pawn and try to hold it since the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Even though White is much higher rated than Black Black still should just take the pawn since declining it is like giving White a free f4-boost.
479,15,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',White's other choice was fxe5 Nxe4 Nf3 but this continuation has transposed into the Vienna Gambit (e4 e5 Nc3 Nf6 f4!?)
480,15,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black still won't take the pawn and has planted it in the centre. White still offered the pawn for a few more moves but Black refuses to accept the gambit.
481,15,6,d3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1PPb1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Both sides have almost completed development but Black has not castled yet which is what led to his loss. I think h3 is better than d3 here since Black cannot play Bh5 due to g4 Bg6 f5 trapping the bishop. Black would have to lose a tempo or take the knight which leaves White with the bishop pair.
482,15,7,Nh5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2np4/4p2n/2B1PPb1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This move is a blunder and immediately loses material. It was much better for Black to simply castle or play Qd7 and castle queenside if Black is concerned about White starting a kingside pawnstorm.
483,15,8,fxe5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2np4/4P2n/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Black's blunder would've only cost him a pawn but Black wasn't prepared for Baker's attack since he simply assumes that f3 is pinned. If Black plays dxe5 then Bxf7  Kxf7 Nxe5   and White wins the piece back with extra pawns.
484,15,9,Nxe5,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p4/4n2n/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black simply assumes that White's knight is pinned and cannot take so he probably didn't even consider it. If he had then perhaps he would've seen the devestating effects of Baker's attack and not have blundered Nh5 in the first place.
485,15,10,1Bxf7+,b'r2qk2r/ppp1bBpp/3p4/4N2n/4P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1Bb1RK1 b kq -',White is down a lot of material but the results of the attack could be disastrous
486,15,11,1Bxh5+,b'r2q1k1r/ppp1b1pp/3p4/4N2B/4P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1Bb1RK1 b - -',Nd7  was another idea because Qxd7 Be6  wins back the queen but after the smoke clears material is even and White hardly has an advantage.
487,15,12,1Bf6,b'r2q1k1r/ppp3pp/3p1b2/4N2B/4P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1Bb1RK1 w - -',If Kg8 then Bxf7  Kf8 Nd7  with the same queen winning idea as before except this time White has an extra piece.
488,15,13,1Rxf6+,b'r2q1k1r/ppp3pp/3p1R2/4N2B/4P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1Bb2K1 b - -',This magnificent sacrifice is the only way to keep the fuel burning and continue the attack. Here Black's best resource is Kg8 and it's hard for White to continue the attack but three pieces is already more than enough to compensate for the queen.
489,15,14,1gxf6,b'r2q1k1r/ppp4p/3p1p2/4N2B/4P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1Bb2K1 w - -',If Qxf6 then Nd7  wins back the queen with extra material this move actually lets White have forced checkmate

PS - from Wikepedia:
[edit] Original Grandmasters (1914)
The title ""Grandmaster"" was first formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas II who in 1914 awarded it to five players (Lasker Capablanca Alekhine Tarrasch and Marshall) who were finalists of a tournament in Saint Petersburg which he had partially funded. The tournament was won by Lasker ahead of Capablanca.


[edit] Non-standard usage (1914–1950)
After 1914 the term ""Grandmaster"" was sometimes informally applied to other world class players.

In the early 1930s the Soviet Union brought in the title of ""Grandmaster of the USSR"" for their own players since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country.


[edit] Official Status (1950 onwards)
FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. These players were:

The top players of the day: world champion Botvinnik and those who had qualified for (or been seeded into) the inaugural Candidates Tournament in 1950: Boleslavsky Bondarevsky Bronstein Euwe Fine Flohr Keres Kotov Lilienthal Najdorf Reshevsky Smyslov Stĺhlberg and Szabó. 
Players still living who though past their best in 1950 were recognised as having been world class when at their peak: Bernstein Duras Grünfeld Kostić Levenfish Maroczy Mieses Ragozin Rubinstein Sämisch Tartakower and Vidmar. 
By recognising world class players before 1950 this gave continuity with the original 1914 Grandmasters except for world class players who had died between 1914 and 1950 (such as Carl Schlechter Richard Reti and Aron Nimzowitsch).

Since 1950 players have had to qualify for the Grandmaster title according to FIDE rules.

Certainly Nimzo would have received the ""official"" title had he lived."
514,18,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',The characteristic move of the Tarrasch Defense. Named for the player this type of defense many times leads to black having an isolated d pawn but very active piece play.
515,18,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',And white heads immediately into Queen's Gambit territory.
516,18,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black plays for QGD lines.
517,18,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',?! A little risky as 5...dxc 6. Bxc loses tempo for white.
518,18,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It's interesting to note that if black had played 5...dxc 6. Bxc Nc6 the main line of the QGA would now be reached but with black having an extra tempo.
519,18,6,b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/1P1BPN2/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Both sides seem content (for now) to just follow a symmetrical development plan.
520,18,7,Nbd2,b'r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/1P1BPN2/PB1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',As a 1. d4 player myself I learned a valuable lesson here. The developing move Nbd2 appears sound and logical but perhaps it was better to develop this knight to c3 instead as black's d pawn seriously constricts it on d2.
521,18,8,1Rc1,b'r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/1P1BPN2/PB1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',Shoring up the c file which may very well be opened soon.
522,18,9,1Qe7,b'r4rk1/pb2qppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/1P1BPN2/PB1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',Connecting the rooks and preparing for play down the e file.

I can only assume that Nimzo was hoping to rip open the c file and play Qc2 next (which is fairly common in QG positions as it threatens play on black's h pawn).
524,18,11,1Nh4,b'r4rk1/pb2qppp/1pnb1n2/2pp4/3P3N/1P1BP3/PB1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',?! An obvious lure of black's g pawn as the white bishop on b2 can be activated after white plays dxc. This just seems a little slow however and loses tempo. Maybe 12. dxc bxc 13. BxN QxB 14. e4 was a stronger continuation.
525,18,12,1Bb5,b'3r1rk1/pb2qp1p/2nb1np1/1Bpp4/8/1P2PN2/PB1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',As black has played g6 white's light squared bishop has lost some of it's zip.
526,18,13,1Ne4,b'3r1rk1/pb2qp1p/2nb2p1/1Bpp4/4n3/1P2PN2/PB1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',A very natural post for this knight to occupy.

I'm sure Nimzo would roll over in his grave if he knew that some 1500 rated internet junkie was putting all of the ""?!'s"" next to his moves but I just didn't get this one. Why give Black the very active bishop pair here? What's wrong with Qc2 or Qe2?"
528,18,15,Nxd2,b'3r1rk1/p3qp1p/2bb2p1/2pp4/8/1P2PN2/PBQn1PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Tarrasch practically forces white to take back with NxN to avoid tempo loss and control of the b1/h7 diagonal.
529,18,16,d4,b'3r1rk1/p3qp1p/2bb2p1/2p5/3p4/1P2P3/PBQN1PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',! Black's c6 bishop is now in the game and Tarrasch begins forming sacrifice plans on Nimzo's castled position.
530,18,17,Bxh2+,b'3r1rk1/p3qp1p/2b3p1/2p5/3P4/1P6/PBQN1PPb/2R2RK1 w - -',! Game on! Tarrasch starts stripping away white's defenses.
531,18,18,Bxg2,b'3r1rk1/p4p1p/6p1/2p5/3P3q/1P6/PBQN1Pb1/2R2RK1 w - -',! Bam! Once again black offers a bishop sac. 
532,18,19,2f3,b'3r1rk1/p4p1p/6p1/2p5/3P3q/1P3P2/PBQN2b1/2R2RK1 b - -',Definitely best - just work this out: 22. Kxg Qg4  23. Kh1 Rd5 24. Qxc Qh5  25. Kg1 Qg5  26. Kh1 RxQ. Nimzo is creating an escape square for his king because he knows that he is in a boatload of trouble.
533,18,20,2Rfe8,b'3rr1k1/p4p1p/6p1/2p5/3P3q/1P3P2/PBQN2b1/2R2RK1 w - -',Black is now fully activated and preparing to deliver the death blow.
534,18,21,2Ne4,b'3rr1k1/p4p1p/6p1/2p5/3PN2q/1P3P2/PBQ3b1/2R2RK1 b - -',Go back to white's 9th move. Another unforseen liability of that move was that it would restrict the white queen along the second rank. Nimzo clears this obstacle now but it is WAAAAY too late.
535,18,22,Bxf1,b'3rr1k1/p4p1p/6p1/2p5/3PN3/1P3P2/PBQ2K2/2R2b1q w - -',! A simple but effective tactic. If white plays 25. RxB then black responds 25...Qh2  and wins the white queen.
536,18,23,2d5,b'3rr1k1/p4p1p/6p1/2pP4/4N3/1P3P2/PBQ2K2/2R2b1q b - -',White finally tries to get the play along the dark diagonal he was shooting for when he played the dubious 12. Nh4.
537,18,24,2f5,b'3rr1k1/p6p/6p1/2pP1p2/4N3/1P3P2/PBQ2K2/2R2b1q w - f6',25... Qg2  26. Ke1 Qxf was just as effective.
538,18,25,2Qc3,b'3rr1k1/p6p/6p1/2pP1p2/4N3/1PQ2P2/PB3K2/2R2b1q b - -',White gets his only threat of the game looking to mate on g7. However black has a very nice practically forced win in a few more moves.
539,18,26,Rxe4+,b'3r2k1/p6p/6p1/2pP1p2/4r3/1PQ1KP2/PB4q1/2R2b2 w - -',! Obviously black can't allow white the time to attack so he strikes first.
540,18,27,f4+,b'3r2k1/p6p/6p1/2pP4/4Pp2/1PQ1K3/PB4q1/2R2b2 w - -',In researching this game I discovered two things - 1) These two guys didn't really care for each other (at all - it sounded to me like they really hated each other in my readings) and 2) Tarrasch actually had a quicker forced mate with 28... Qg3  29. Kd2 Qf2  30. Kd1 Qe2#. Perhaps Tarrasch's dislike of Nimzowitsch compelled him to play for this more humiliating mate.
541,18,28,Bb5#,b'4r1k1/p2K3p/6p1/1bpP4/4P3/1PQ5/PB5q/2R5 w - -',Ouch! That was just WRONG! (but oooh so RIGHT!) I discovered that Nimzowitsch had a lifetime edge of  5=5-2 against Tarrasch but for Dr. Tarrasch I'm sure that a vindictive mate such as this went a long way to soothing his ego. I hope you enjoyed the game:) - Thomas
542,19,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I am White in this game and I start with a safe solid non-committal opening which waits to see how Black will continue.
543,19,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',Black's move is more committal since pawns cannot move backward and now Black has committed a pawn to the centre. 
544,19,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I like to develop my kingside quickly and castle safely. My knight and fianchettoed bishop will be good defenders of my king and also good attackers if Black messes up.
545,19,3,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This move surprised me a lot and I have never even considered anyone playing this kind of move against me. Black has overextended his pawn which slightly weakens his position.
546,19,4,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Now my fianchettoed bishop will be stronger since Black can no longer block it with d5.
547,19,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',If Black was going to overextend his center early then he should've at least followed up with c5 to support the weakened d-pawn and then try for Nc6 e5.
548,19,6,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3p4/2P2NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Maybe this move wasn't quite necessary but I was impatient to try and take advantage of Black's questionable d4. I challenge the pawn with a less valuable pawn so if Black trades I'll have an extra centre pawn plus an open c-file and big lead in development.
549,19,7,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2Pp1NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This was the best move since c5 loses a pawn. 4...c5? then 5.cxd4 cxd4 6.Qa4  Nc6 7.Nxd4!! and I have an overwhelming attack on the c6-knight.
550,19,8,Qxd3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2Pq1NP1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now Black is forced to bring out his queen early allowing me to gain development tempo.
551,19,9,Ne5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4N3/8/2Pq2P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I can get my knight to a better square while gaining tempo.
552,19,10,Qb5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1q2N3/8/2P3P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think it was better to undevelop the queen and then try to recover the tempo loss because now Black's queen is subject to harassment.
553,19,11,Nbd7,b'r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1q2N3/3P4/2P3P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think it was better to develop the kingside and castle quickly
554,19,12,Nd3,b'r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1q6/3P4/2PN2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',My knight has moved 3 times but it is very strong on d3 and now I have a nice grip on the center squares.
555,19,13,Nb6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/1q6/3P4/2PN2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is a terrible move and leaves Black very behind in development and I can gain tempo chasing the oddly placed pieces. 
556,19,14,a4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/1q6/P2P4/2PN2P1/1P3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq a3',My a-pawn can reach a6 with tempo for an early attack on the undeveloped queenside so now Black has no counterplay and must defend.
557,19,15,1Qe2,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n2qn2/P7/3P4/2PN2P1/1P2QPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I think it's good to trade queens and go into an endgame where my king is already placed toward the centre and my advantage is easier to exploit. 
558,19,16,Nbd7,b'r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/P7/3P4/2PN2P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R w kq -',If Nbd5 then c4 traps the knight.
559,19,17,c6,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/P1p2n2/8/3P4/2PN2P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R w kq -',Rb8 was another idea but Black wanted the knight to go back to b8 to defend c6. 
560,19,18,1Nb4,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/P1p2n2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R b kq -',I bring another attacker toward the queenside with tempo since I'm threatening axb7 Bxb7 Bxc6 winning a pawn.
561,19,19,1Nb8,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/P1p2n2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R w kq -',Black's knight has moved 4 times and ended up exactly where it started. Black's faulty opening play has left him with a defensive underdeveloped position while all my pieces will find good squares.
562,19,20,1axb7,b'rnb1kb1r/pP2pppp/2p2n2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R b kq -',I trade off a pawn for my opponent's more valuable pawn while making Black's c and a-pawns very weak. I have superior control of all the board so I can't blunder away this advantage.
563,19,21,1Nd2,b'rn2kb1r/pb2pppp/2p2n2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P1NKPBP/R1B4R b kq -',I wanted to get my knight to c4 where it's strongly placed and cannot be chased away by pawns.
564,19,22,1e6,b'rn2kb1r/pb3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P1NKPBP/R1B4R w kq -',Black is threatening to trade his bishop for my knight which damages my superior structure
565,19,23,Bd6,b'rn2k2r/pb3ppp/2pbpn2/8/3P4/2PN2P1/1P1NKPBP/R1B4R w kq -',Maybe this isn't the best place for the bishop I think Be7 is better Black needs to control c5 because Nc5 is a strong place for my knight. I can just harass Black's bishop with Nc5.
566,19,24,Bc8,b'rnb1k2r/p1b2ppp/2p1pn2/2N5/2NP4/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/R1B4R w kq -',I have gained so much tempo in this opening and have excellently positioned pieces. I just need to bring my other rook and bishop into play to take full advantage of my advantage.
567,19,25,2Bf4,b'rnb1k2r/p1b2ppp/2p1pn2/2N5/2NP1B2/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/R6R b kq -',If bishop trades then gxf4 is simple and I have an overwhelming threat of Nb6 not to mention some pawn winning tactical possibilities.
568,19,26,2Nd5,b'rnb1k2r/p1b2ppp/2p1p3/2Nn4/2NP1B2/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/R6R w kq -',This defends the bishop and it will defend the rook after I trade on c7 so then there won't be a pin on the a-pawn.
569,19,27,2b4,b'rnb1k2r/p1n2ppp/2p1p3/2N5/1PNP4/2P3P1/4KPBP/R6R b kq b3',Now it's time to bring my pawn in to challenge the pinned c-pawn. Black's pieces are ridiculously placed and I have a threat of b5.
570,19,28,2b5,b'rnb2rk1/p1n2ppp/2p1p3/1PN5/2NP4/2P3P1/4KPBP/R6R b - -',Perhaps Black didn't see my threat or maybe he couldn't find a way to defend it. The knight is tied down to defending a8 from my Nb6 threat and the c-pawn is the only thing blocking my bishop's path. Black will lose an exchange.
571,19,29,2Rxb8,b'1Rb2rk1/5ppp/2p1p3/1np5/3P4/2P3P1/4KPBP/7R b - -',I'm up an exchange but Black will get some pawns so the resulting endgame will be tough. 
572,19,30,2Nxc3+,b'1Rb2rk1/5ppp/2p1p3/2p5/3P4/2n3P1/4KPBP/7R w - -',This move gives me much better winning chances I think Bd7 gives Black the best chance to draw.
573,19,31,2Kd2,b'1Rb2rk1/5ppp/2p1p3/2p5/3P4/2n3P1/3K1PBP/7R b - -',Now Black's knight is in danger so he doesn't have time to defend my sneaky piece-winning threat
574,19,32,2Ra1,b'1Rb2rk1/5ppp/2p1p3/8/3p4/2n3P1/3K1PBP/R7 b - -',Black has three pawns for the exchange but now I win a piece back since there is nothing stopping Ra8. Even if Black plays Bd7 Ra8 is still crushing since taking my rook leads to mate and I am double attacking Black's rook.
575,19,33,2e5,b'1Rb2rk1/5ppp/2p5/4p3/3p4/2n3P1/3K1PBP/R7 w - -',If Nb5 then Bxc6 Nc7 Ra7! or Bxc6 Nd6 Ra8 with Bd7 to follow also winning a piece.
576,19,34,2Raa8,b'RRb2rk1/5ppp/2p5/4p3/3p4/2n3P1/3K1PBP/8 b - -',I win a piece no matter how Black continued but the resulting endgame is still hard since Black is up a lot of pawns.
577,19,35,3Rxc6,b'8/5kpp/2R5/4pp2/3p4/2n3P1/3K1PBP/8 b - -',Black has two pawns for the rook and he is starting to overextend them I think it's a better idea for Black to keep the pawns back where they are safe.
578,19,36,3Rxc3,b'8/5kpp/8/5p2/3pp3/2R3P1/3K1PBP/8 b - -',I sacrifice part of my material advantage to reach and ending where my material advantage is simpler.
579,19,37,3Kd4,b'8/6pp/5k2/5p2/3Kp3/6P1/5PBP/8 b - -',This move forces Black to let me play Bxe4 which sacrifices more of my material advantage to give me an even simpler material advantage.
580,19,38,3Kxe4,b'8/6p1/5k2/7p/4K3/6P1/5P1P/8 b - -',Being up a rook for two pawns ( 3) was a more complicated ending than when I was up a bishop for a pawn ( 2) and now I have an even simpler ending where I'm up a simple pawn ( 1) for a simple win.
581,19,39,3h3,b'8/6p1/8/6kp/4K3/6PP/5P2/8 b - -',All I need to do is restrict Black's king from coming in and put him in zugswang until he allows my king to come through and push him away from defending his pawns.
582,19,40,3Kf6,b'8/6p1/5k2/7p/4K3/6PP/5P2/8 w - -',If h4 then g4 is simple
583,19,41,3f4,b'8/6p1/5k2/7p/4KP2/6PP/8/8 b - f3',Tightening the barrier
584,19,42,g5,b'8/8/5k2/6pp/4KPP1/7P/8/8 w - -',This was Black's last hope for a draw. I must be careful not to play gxh5?? because then gxf4 leaves me with two unpromotable side-pawns and Black's king can simply go to the corner and draw. A king vs. a king and any number of rook pawns is an elementary draw. No matter how many rook pawns you have the opponent can draw if his king gets to the promoting corner first or if it can trap your king in the promoting corner where you're blocked by your own side-pawn.
585,19,43,4f5,b'8/8/5k2/5Ppp/4K1P1/7P/8/8 b - -',I must also not be careful to play fxg5?? because then Kxg5 is another elementary draw. I can't take the h-pawn because it leaves me with two rook pawns and once Black exchanges on g4 I can't promote my pawn because there is no way for me to get my king in front of my pawn and push Black's king away. Black has no more drawing tricks so he just resigned here.
586,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My favorite opening with white.

720,25,1,Nxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Bc4 would be the Dunst-Hector Gambit. With this move white maintains material equality and has a developed piece in the center. The knight controls g5 and c5 while it influences f6 and d6. There is a sacrifice potential at f6 which offers nothing at the moment. The knight is unprotected.

The decision may have been made to keep the knight centralized for control and because using the d pawn would end with a trade of queens and white losing castle rights. A better move would be Ne4-g3 to counter attack the bishop and regaining tempo. The bishop is protected.
723,25,4,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/4N3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Black enables protection of the bishop while opening a line for the king bishop. The position favors black slightly because of the pin on the knight and because if the bishops are traded the pawn structure is disrupted and because white loses the king bishop which tends to be the more favorable bishop.

The most predominant aspect that can be observed in this game is that it is better to develop pieces castle then begin an attack on the center or side where is makes most sense. Timing makes the difference for an attack as does having enough pieces developed so they can assist. The queen is not able to achieve mate alone - other pieces are needed.

976,39,5,Nd2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',One of several options here for white (currently not perhaps the most popular). The idea is to bring the knight to c4 putting pressure on d6; at the same time white's control of the d1-h5 diagonal inhibits black from initiating his kingside counterplay by Nh5.
977,39,6,a5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp1npbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - a6',It is important for black to prevent a quick b4 and c5 break.

In Ljubojevic-Kasparov (Linares 1993) white played Nb3 supporting the c5 break but leaving the knight misplaced for the sequel. This move is intended to put pressure down the c-file while adding to a possible later defence of g2.
984,39,13,1Nf6,b'r1bq1r1k/1pp1n1bp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/1PP1Pp2/P1N2P2/2QNB1PP/1RB2RK1 w - -',I thought this was a dubious move removing a defender of c5. Black obviously thought it was time to get his own counterplay rolling though in fact it never really materialized.

990,39,19,2Nc7,b'r2q1r1k/1pNbn1b1/3N1n2/3Pp2p/1P2Ppp1/5P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - -',White looks to be on top but his invading knights are in danger of becoming overstretched here.

992,39,21,2Bc6,b'1r1q1r1k/1pN1n1b1/2bN1n2/1B1Pp2p/1P2Ppp1/5P2/2Q3PP/1RB2RK1 w - -',Exclamation mark!

It turned out not to be good and adhering to it blinded me to several not particularly difficult better moves during the coming phase. Another factor in this phase was a loss of morale at the overturning of my apparent advantage from the opening.

999,39,28,Rb8,b'1r6/1P1rn1bk/8/2B1p2p/2B1Ppp1/5P2/6PP/1R4K1 w - -',The simple move that puts a stop to white's ambitions.
1000,39,29,3Bd6,b'1r6/1P1r2bk/BR1B4/n3p2p/4Ppp1/5P2/6PP/6K1 b - -',Not there fast enough. There is nothing for it now but to cut my losses.
1001,39,30,3Rxb7,b'8/1R4bk/3B4/n3p2p/4Ppp1/5P2/6PP/6K1 b - -',There was no good way of keeping the rooks on the board.
1002,39,31,3Nxb7,b'8/1n4bk/3B4/4p2p/4Ppp1/5P2/6PP/6K1 w - -',White is a piece down for the endgame. However his bishop is much better than black's and the pawn structure holds out a slim hope for a fortress. 
1003,39,32,3Bc7,b'8/1nB3bk/8/4p2p/4Ppp1/5P2/6PP/6K1 b - -',Keeping the black bishop tied down to the defence of e5.
1004,39,33,Ne6,b'8/2B3b1/4n1k1/4p2p/4Ppp1/5P2/4K1PP/8 w - -',Heading for a strong outpost on d4.
1005,39,34,Nd4+,b'8/6b1/3B2k1/4p2p/3nPpp1/5P2/4K1PP/8 w - -',The white king is now tied down to f2.
1006,39,35,Ke6,b'8/6b1/4k3/2B1p2p/3nPpp1/5P2/5KPP/8 w - -',I had entertained the possibility of playing for a pawn overlap with fg once the black king moved away from the kingside. However I decided this gave no real chances and went instead for an attempted fortress.
1007,39,36,4h3,b'8/6b1/4k3/2B1p2p/3nPpp1/5P1P/5KP1/8 b - -',The crucial move in white's defensive plan. If black plays ...g3 it already looks like a fortress while exchanging on f3 or h3 still leads to a position that is not easy to break down.
1008,39,37,Kf6,b'8/6b1/5k2/2B1p2p/3nPp2/5P1P/5K2/8 w - -',Black's king changes direction and heads for the h3 pawn a mistaken plan in my view.
1009,39,38,4Bb4,b'8/6b1/8/4p1kp/1B1nPp2/5P1P/6K1/8 b - -',There is the nice possibility here of black allowing himself to be mated after ...Kh4 Be7  :)
1010,39,39,4Bf6,b'8/8/5b2/4p1kp/1B1nPp2/5P1P/6K1/8 w - -',...but Black makes sure that isn't going to happen.
1011,39,40,4Kf2,b'8/8/5b2/4p1kp/1B1nPp2/5P1P/5K2/8 b - -',Inviting black to proceed with his kingside plan. The only winning chance I believe was to bring the king all the way round via the queenside to e2 and white could probably not have held.
1012,39,41,5Kg2,b'8/8/5b2/4p2p/1B1nPp1k/5P1P/6K1/8 b - -',White's plan now is to move the bishop between d6 and c7 keeping black's bishop tied to defending the pawn and of course the d8-h4 diagonal. If black moves the knight the white king is free to move to h2 and if he moves the king it is free to move to f2.
1013,39,42,5Nxf3,b'8/8/5b2/4p2p/1B2Pp1k/5n1P/6K1/8 w - -',An interesting but flawed sacrifice. The flaw is that black's king will be blockaded on the h-file in front of its pawn while the black bishop is powerless to dislodge the defenders.
1014,39,43,5Bd6,b'8/8/3B1b2/4p2p/4Pp2/5K1k/8/8 b - -',"I believed the draw was secure (I originally annotated the position as drawn) and played this move intending to occupy the b7-g1 diagonal as soon as black advanced his king or pawn. After reading my annotations my opponent suggested that the king retreat Kh4-g5 wins and I now think he is right. This move was therefore a blunder; I should have played Be1 preventing the king retreat and answering Bh4 with Bc3. 

Unfortunately (fortunately for me) at this point black timed out."
