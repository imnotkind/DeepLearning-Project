This game had echos of my previous game against Master Janet in which she gave me an exchange sac in the middle game and later on Henry got caught in a mating net on the d column.  A similar thing happens in this game only this time just like the times Steve Backshall managed to evade the bees hippos and alligators (taking photos at the same time!) and get back to the truck Henry manages to escape from the clutches of the Wicked Witch and find sanctuary on the a column.  I end up being a whole rook up and with Bob's mating attack completely burnt out it was only a matter of time before I forced a queen swap and ensured safe passage for a pawn to get to Glendadom before Bob waved the white flag.  So how did this happen?  Well you can follow the action by the Gameknot Analysis link below.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15462595&fb=1&rnd=0.16887384178856135"

Has anybody ever heard of Steve Backshall?  Well he is a guy who just lurves chasing wild animals although on occasions they chase him.  I found out about him from watching a Children's programme called CBBC with my six year old Charlotte and later played the CBBC game where Steve has to outrun bees hippos and alligators - this game is called Steve's Deadly Dash.  In this MT in aid of the Christchurch Earthquake I am playing Master Janet.  Things seemed to be OK for me when suddenly Henry was subjected to a deadly dash from her rook and the Wicked Witch of the West.  Alas Henry got caught and he had to rest up!  Anyhow on with the game.  Gameknot Analysis is provided in the following link.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15488483&fb=1&rnd=0.19786173690656117.

304,9,1,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. g3 - white usually likes to fianchetto a lsb on the kingside in the English Opening and Janet is no exception.

I choose to defend by Qh5?? but this proves to be the losing move according to Gameknot Analysis.  My opponent also suggested 26.Qe6 and she thought that if I played that then I would have had great drawing chances.  Again I miss the chance to add Janet's name to my Master Draw list!

White will put pressure on the isolated a- and c-pawns protect the passed pawn on d5 with Rd1 and get the two Bishops to better placements. Frankly I hate to play Black in this opening line but of course it is just a matter of taste.
322,10,5,2Rd1,b'6k1/p1r2pbp/1n1q2p1/1QpPp3/4P1B1/2P1B3/P4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Black cannot do much more than defend in this position.

325,10,8,Qd8,b'2rq1bk1/p4p2/3P2p1/PQp1p2p/4P3/2P1B3/5PPP/3R2K1 w - -',In a lost position is is hard to give good advise but Black had a little trick up his sleeve if he had played: 25. - Rd8!? Then 26. dxe7???? Rxd1+ ending up with a Bishops endgame and good chances for Black. But of course White can just play 26. Bxc5 Qe6 27. Rd5 followed by c3-c4.
326,10,9,Rb8,b'1r1q1bk1/p2P1p2/6p1/PQp1p2p/4P3/2P1B3/5PPP/3R2K1 w - -',? The same as resignation but after 26. - Rc7 27. Bg5 will be devastating. Black held on for a few more moves.
327,10,10,3Bf8+,b'3qQB2/p2P1pk1/5bp1/P6p/4P3/2P5/5PPP/3R2K1 b - -',There is a forced mate in eight moves. I hope the theme around the advanced d-pawn will provide you with some inspiration if you try your luck in the Gruenfeld.

375,13,2,a4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2p2n2/8/P1p5/5NP1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq a3',Qc2 is more normal in these lines (e.g. Nf3 d5 c4 c6 g3 Nf6 Bg2 dxc4 0-0 Nbd7 Qc2 would be mainline) but I felt that now the usual plans of defending the pawn with Be6 and Nd7b6 wont fly then I can afford to secure the position on the queenside play Na3 Qc2 win the pawn and have the better game.

1. ... Bc6?! Naxb5 Qd7 (Qb6?? Ra6!) Nxc6 Nxc6 Nd4 with a lost position
2. ... Nc6 Naxb5 Qb7 Nxc6 Bxc6 Rxa7! Rxa7  (Bxg2 Rxb7 Bxb7 shouldn't give enough compensation for the queen) Nxa7 Qxa7 Bxc6+ "

In this sort of position if a side is making defensive moves they are normally struggling but the key point is that Black can make these moves without conceding tempo.

This all comes from Black's pieces being better placed and coordinated to combine attack and defense

The fact that White's bishop gets centralised isn't too relevant as if the knight develops before the bishop retreats to g2 then Bh3 and Bg5 cement the White's king in the exposed centre.

1. Qc2 Be3 Bc1?? Qf1+! Rxf1 Rxf1+ Ke2 Rf2+ picking up a clear rook as the king can't get to the queen (Kd1 Bg4+) 

2. Qc2 Be3 Bxa8 Rxa8 and the king can't flee to the queenside now because Qf3+ can always meet Kd1. Without this resource Black can just play Re8 and pick the king off. 

3. Qe2 fails to Bg4! (Qh6 with the idea of Be3 and Rf2 isn't clear as Bxa8 buys White some time in this line and the king may be able to run via d1 to safety) after which Qc2 Rae8 Bc1 Qf3! Rg1 Bxc1 and there is no defence to both Qf2 and Qe3)."

869,34,13,Kd7,b'8/1p1k1ppp/p3p3/8/1P1r1P2/P2P1K2/3R3P/8 w - -',The black king points to the queenside because his pawn structure is nuclear-proof on the king side. The pawns can defend themselves.

920,37,0,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',c4 is an alternative taking play into a Gurgenidze Accelerated Dragon after g6. Nc3 is fine though expecting a Classical Sicilian
921,37,1,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is quite an odd move order for the dragon but I couldn't find a punishment of any kind
922,37,2,f3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Bb3 isn't necessary due to the early d6. We are now in a normal dragon as opposed to an accelerated
923,37,3,1Be2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/n7/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',This is more precise than the usual Bb3. It looks odd to retreat the bishop but the knight doesn't belong on a5 so it will likely transpose to a more mainstream dragon line after Bd7 Rc8 and Nc4.
924,37,4,1Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary afetr 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything. 
925,37,5,1O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R b - -',A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary after 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything. 
926,37,6,1Qa5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/q7/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R w - -',This doesn't seem consistent. The only meaningful idea behind Nc6 I thought was to play into a 0-0-0 rather than a Bc4 dragon with d5 where the loss of tempo may be made slightly relevant by the fact that I'm in an opening less consistent with my repertoire.
927,37,7,1h4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1ppbp/2np1np1/8/4P2P/1NN1BP2/PPPQB1P1/2KR3R b - h3',The last two moves have resulted in a transposition to mainline Qa5 dragon with an extra tempo spent on Be2. Now after the main move h5 then g4 will come with more force now thanks to the bishop on e2 and the rook on d1 getting to g1 quickly
928,37,8,1Nh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1ppbp/2np2p1/7n/4P2P/1NN1BP2/PPPQB1P1/2KR3R w - -',This is just a weird move. It's very rare that Black can be thinking about positional movement on the kingside in a dragon without the attack breaking through
929,37,9,Be5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1pp1p/2np2p1/4b3/4P1PP/1NN1BPn1/PPPQB2R/2KR4 w - -',This move is another strange one to look at. It has a few interesting lines though. The main sequence I looked at was f4 Bxc3 bxc3 (Qxc3 Nxe2 Rxe2 Bxg4) Nxe2 Qxe2 where white does have the doubled pawn weakness but this wont be significant because of the dark square weaknesses in Black's kingside and fact that White's queenside is much more developed.
930,37,10,Bg7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1ppbp/2np2p1/8/4PPPP/1NN1B3/PPP1Q2R/2KR4 w - -',This makes Black's position inconsolable. The losses of tempo are quite visible with the four pawns on the kingside compared to Black's immobile a and b pawns.

Sorry about a lack of analysis in this game it was more based on opening themes than concrete variations as the attacking moves are quite easy to find and the position sort of plays itself
937,38,0,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I now have complete control of the four most important squares on the board. (Not a win but a step toward it!)
