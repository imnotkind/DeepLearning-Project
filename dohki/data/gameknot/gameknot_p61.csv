Paul you gave me more than a run for my money - you went into an endgame with even material and an even position (so that will be good endgame experience for you against much higher rated oppo) and at one stage you looked like you might steal a win so you can hold your head up high here.

268,13,7,1Bxe5,b'rnb1k2r/p2pqp2/2p2p1p/4B3/1p2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White's obvious response.  Bd2 is not an alternative since black's response is Bxb2 and then white must move a rook and black again enjoys QxPe4+.

While it is nice to have the d file open for the queen black will trade queens if white interposes since every every subsequent trade boosts black's material advantage.  If white moves the king both rooks fall for free.
274,13,13,2Rf4,b'5r2/2k2p2/n1pp3p/4r3/1p1N1R2/8/P1P2PPP/3K4 b - -',Mm I kind of like Rf6.  Black might respond with Rh5 then white moves h3.  Rg5 g3...  White's pawns defend each other.  Rc5 or (better) Ra5 would be bad for black as Ne6+ ends with white trading a knight for a rook (PxN RxR).
275,13,14,2Rd5,b'5r2/2k2p2/n1pp3p/3r4/1p1N1R2/8/P1P2PPP/3K4 w - -',Well that pins white's knight.  Kc1 might be the best bet.

278,13,17,Rg8,b'6r1/2k2p2/2ppn2p/3r4/1R6/8/P1P2PPP/2K5 w - -',"White could play for a stalemate.  White's a pawn is passed while black's pawns have to claw their way through white's.  So white still enjoys some advantages.  A stalemate is as good as a victory if that half point wins the match for the team.

That extra rook and knight can work to white's advantage.  Give a guy a .22 and he has to be very cautious with shot placement.  But armed with a bazooka overconfidence can lead to disaster--black could shoot his own foot off."
279,14,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I wanted to play a classical opening something computers are excellent at dealing with. 
280,14,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',We begin with a Russian Opening. Excalibur seems to love countering e4 with this.
281,14,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My response is the most logical the e-pawns are exchanged and both sides have playable positions.
282,14,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here we see how Black decides to entrench the knight on e4 a key feature of the classical Russian. 
283,14,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This line already offers the potential to follow the path of the game Browne-Bisguier (US Champ. 1974) whereby Browne played the aesthetic and amazing 14.Bh6!... In response the line stemming from 6...Be7. If you haven't seen this game please research it - it's an amazing demonstration of chess skill.
284,14,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black pursues the most common line and shoots at my kingside. The bishop also compromises f4 and controls several queenside sqaures. 6...Be7 would follow the Browne-Bisguier line.
285,14,6,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Although the best line you can't help but feel a little uncomfortable with a bishop and an active knight crawling nereby the kingside.
286,14,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Black replies in kind. However it should be noted that as Black's dark-squared bishop attacks h2 My light-squared bishop attacks h7 in an 'x-ray' attack through the knight.
287,14,8,c4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - c3',My prediction is a swap-off on c4 (in the future when Black either solidifies or saves the e4-knight) due to Excalibur's - and indeed several computers - tendency to create isolated pawns. Nonetheless this move undermines Black's knight's defender.
288,14,9,Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bb3/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Black deviates from the main line as computers do. More common and preferred here is the Marshall trap - ( 8...Bg4 9. cxd5 f5 10. Re1 Bxh2+) which is seen as hugely powerful for Black but still advantageous in some positional aspects for White.
289,14,10,Re1,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bb3/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Continuing to pressure Black's naturally advanced yet fragile Russian centre.
290,14,11,Bb4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3p4/1bPPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - -',Black starts the fun. Playing 10. Re2... would compromise position and one variation leads to the loss of the d-pawn (10. Nbd2 Bxd2 11. Bxd2 Nxd2 12. Nxd2 dxc4 13. [B/N]xc4 Qxd4 -/+) leaving Black with a material bonus. In my opinion this move lays out a dwonfall for Black positionally. 9...f5 looked more tantalising and the e4-knight would have held under it.
291,14,12,1cxd5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/1b1Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',I choose on complicating matters and attacking two minor pieces in exchange for a rook appears positive given my central minor-piece positioning.
292,14,13,1Kxe1,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/3P4/3B1N2/PP4PP/RNBQK3 b - -',Recapturing with the king is superior than 12. Qxe1... which would cause the queen to be displaced soon enough by a Black rook on e8. Also recapturing with the f3-knight would essentially 'undevelop' the piece and open up the king drastically.
293,14,14,1Bxd5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3B1N2/PP4PP/RNBQK3 w - -',"At the end of the exchange I have given a rook and a pawn for a knight and a bishop. This exchange is usually beneficial since two minor pieces should in theory control more squares than a rook and are also more manoeuvreable. 
    Secondly Black threatens material gain with 13...Bxf3 followed by 14...Qxd4. However an exchange on f3 would leave me with several far-reaching pieces in the centre of the board attacking at both the kingside and queenside."
294,14,15,1Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP4PP/RN1QK3 b - -',Development of the bishop not only defends the vulnerable d4-pawn but also continues to aim at the kingside. 
295,14,16,1Re8,b'rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP4PP/RN1QK3 w - -',A wise move on Black's part. Since Black has no viable central pawns to advance he makes the most of the open d+e files and attacks down them. The rook move renders the e3-bishop useless. Whilst I attack from the centre Black fires upon me from afar. 
296,14,17,1Kf2,b'rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3KPP/RN1Q4 b - -',Oddly enough I would count this as a development move. My king can't waste time to escape behing the g + h pawns so I make the most of him. He holds the centre together.
297,14,18,1Qxf3,b'rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P4/3BBQ2/PP3KPP/RN6 b - -',Black completes my vision of three long-ranged pieces with potential across the board. The centre is under my command with the exception of the d5-sqaure which is attacked by both queens. Potential targets are b7 f7 and h7 all potentially realised by my three pieces.
298,14,19,1Qh4+,b'rn2r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P3q/3BBQ2/PP3KPP/RN6 w - -',Black scrambles for position and develops his queen to an active post.
299,14,20,1Kf1,b'rn2r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P3q/3BBQ2/PP4PP/RN3K2 b - -',16. Kg1?... would lead to 16...Qe1+ and a forsaken piece on e3 costing the game. However If Black plays the poor 16...Qxh2?  it results in 17. Qxb7... and if 17...Rxe3??  18. Qc8+... wins the game. Black has improved but not as much as you might think.
300,14,21,1Qe7,b'rn2r1k1/ppp1qppp/8/8/3P4/3BBQ2/PP4PP/RN3K2 w - -',Black forms a much stronger battery and the forcing of my king to f1 leaves the e3-bishop weak. If I move my king to f2 a perpetual check is an option for Black - not the worst option for the computer considering my positional potential. If I played 17. Kd2... the e3-bishop would be rendered useless and Black would gain an advantage.
301,14,22,1Bd2,b'rn2r1k1/ppp1qppp/8/8/3P4/3B1Q2/PP1B2PP/RN3K2 b - -',I chose this over 17. Bf2... becuase it is more active and still aims at the kingside. Also I have deduced that since I can soon develop the knight the rook will defend e1 adequately and my pieces can return on the positional advantage. 
302,14,23,1c6,b'rn2r1k1/pp2qppp/2p5/8/3P4/3B1Q2/PP1B2PP/RN3K2 w - -',Black finally stakes a pawn in the centre. He has seized control of the d5-square occupiable by his knight. Also he has eliminated the potency of my queen across the a8-h1 diagonal. In return however I can release my rook and develop my knight. This has implications of Re1. Furthermore if Black's knight chooses the d7-square its range is limited by my d4-pawn.
303,14,24,Nd7,b'r3r1k1/pp1nqppp/2p5/8/3P4/2NB1Q2/PP1B2PP/R4K2 w - -',Both knights are now developed but you will notice that they are both restrained by the other's opposing pawns.
304,14,25,1Ne4,b'r3r1k1/pp1nqppp/2p5/8/3PN3/3B1Q2/PP1B2PP/R4K2 b - -',My intentions are to to stump Black's battery on the e-file now quelled. Another bonus of this move is that I can now occupy c3 with my d2-bishop further threatening the Black king's position. One potential sequence is to move my queen to g3 and the dark-squared bishop to h6 tearing the king open.
305,14,26,1b5,b'r3r1k1/p2nqppp/2p5/1p6/3PN3/3B1Q2/PP1B2PP/R4K2 w - b6',(?!) An interesting if dubious move. Black ignores my central knight and pursues a queenside push. He does succeed in limiting my d3-bishop however and 20. Bc3... is now impossible due to 20...b4 with a good infiltration on Black's part.
306,14,27,2Qh3,b'r3r1k1/p2nqppp/2p5/1p6/3PN3/3B3Q/PP1B2PP/R4K2 b - -',My first real 'danger' move. Black should take notice.
307,14,28,2a5,b'r3r1k1/3nqppp/2p5/pp6/3PN3/3B3Q/PP1B2PP/R4K2 w - a6',(?) In my opinion this was one 'free' move too far. Black disregards the urgency on his kingside with four pieces ready to strike. In terms of attack on my part 21.Nf6+...is clever but purely aesthetic as 21...Nxf6 clears the attack and ruins any potential for further threats. Another favourable move is 21. Ng5... but this doesn't force an openong on the king.
308,14,29,2Nd6,b'r3r1k1/3nqppp/2pN4/pp6/3P4/3B3Q/PP1B2PP/R4K2 b - -',"(!) The key move of the game. After spending 25 minutes thinking over the posistion (attack is not my forte and I rarely am able to pull them off against computers!) I came to this move. I calculated these variations - 
V1 - 21...Qxd6 22.Qxh7+ Kf8 23.Qh8+ Ke7 (V1i- 24.Bg5+...) V1ia- [24...Nf6 25.Qxg7 +/-] V1ib- [24...f6 25.Rxe8+ +/-] V1ic- [24...Ke6] and Black can't hold off 25.Re1+ +/-.
(V1ii- 24.Re1+...) V1iia- [24...Nd5 25.Rxd5+ +/-] V1iib- [24...Kf6 25.Rxd8 +/-] V1iic- [25...Kd8 26.Rxd8 +/-]
V2 - 21...Nf6 V2a [22.Bg5+ Qxd6 23.Bxf6 Qxf6+ -/+] V2b- [22.Nxe8 +/-]
This analysis was painstaking but it proved successful. "
309,14,30,Ne5,b'r3r2Q/4kpp1/2pq4/pp2n3/3P4/3B4/PP1B2PP/4RK2 w - -',Black gives back the material. If worse comes to worse I will have two bishops for a rook (meaning I gained a pawn back and am left with two bishops rather than a bishop and knight) - a VERY playable middlegame and endgame. This move is the only one available to Black that doesn't spell total disaster - materially but still doesn't remove my tempo.
310,14,31,Qxe5,b'r3r2Q/4kpp1/2p5/pp2q3/3P4/3B4/PP1B2PP/5K2 w - -',(!?) Black plays an interesting move. Although the transition signifies a poor endgame position for Black it does force me to enter with an isolated central pawn.
311,14,32,2Qxe8+,b'r3Q3/4kpp1/2p5/pp2q3/3P4/3B4/PP1B2PP/5K2 b - -',The only response that will do.
312,14,33,2dxe5,b'4r3/4kpp1/2p5/pp2P3/8/3B4/PP1B2PP/5K2 b - -',My advanced position and two bishops for a rook are all plusses in this game.
313,14,34,Rh5,b'8/4kpp1/2p5/pp2P2r/8/3B3P/PP1B2P1/5K2 w - -',Black is willing to trade a flank pawn for my isolated central pawn a positionally good move since it temporarily banishes my bishop to the side of the board but in my opinion is not good enough to salvage the negatives.
314,14,35,3Kf2,b'8/4kpp1/2p5/Bp2r3/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 b - -',My goal is to advance and press the Black position backwards. the advantage of two bishops is that if Black tries to obstruct one of them with pawns the other triumphs. Also note how crucial squares for Black's rook such as c2 e2 and f5 are controlled by my light-squared bishop.
315,14,36,3Kd6,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/Bp2r3/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 w - -',Black tries to game central prowess.
316,14,37,3Bc3,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/1p2r3/8/2BB3P/PP3KP1/8 b - -',Now the centre is fully mine. Black's g7-pawn is skewered by the c3-bishop.
317,14,38,3Rg5,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/1p4r1/8/2BB3P/PP3KP1/8 w - -',Although this is the only move to avoid instant material loss Black will now feel the strangling effects of my dominant advancing position.
318,14,39,Rd5,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/1p1r4/8/2BB1K1P/PP4P1/8 w - -',A last-ditch attempt to gain power in some ways a  mistake. 32...Rh5 would have provided an escape route for the rook. Instead he is now stranded in the centre.
319,14,40,3Be4,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/1p1r4/4B3/2B2K1P/PP4P1/8 b - -',Note how the crucial squares on the d+e files are patrolled by my bishops.
320,14,41,3g4,b'8/5pp1/2pk4/1p4r1/4B1P1/2B2K1P/PP6/8 b - g3',Black's rook is now stuck fast. After 35. h4... Black is forced to 35...Rc5 with 36. Bb4... +/- sealing the game.
321,14,42,3f6,b'8/6p1/2pk1p2/1p4r1/4B1P1/2B2K1P/PP6/8 w - -',At the very least Black stumps one of my bishops.
322,14,43,3Bb4,b'8/6p1/2pk1p2/1pr5/1B2B1PP/5K2/PP6/8 b - -',Now Black will endure suffering. You may have thought that Excalibur would resign by now....... but that is one defect with the model I use - it NEVER resigns. Nonetheless this does mean my endgame skills are always tested!
323,14,44,3g6,b'8/8/2pk1pp1/1pr5/1B2B1PP/5K2/PP6/8 w - -',My position has slowly creeped up the board and Black cannot retreat efficiently. It's last move is a testament to chess computers. Most chess engines start to throw material away in desperate attempts to break a position open. In this case it lures my bishop to free d5 for the Black king.
324,14,45,3Bxc5,b'8/8/2p2pB1/1pBk4/6PP/5K2/PP6/8 b - -',And now Black loses.

347,16,1,e4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',Transposing into the Sicilian maroczy bind.I think this is a very strong system for white I'm also comfortable playing the black side since I feel I understand the positions quite well. But against a stronger opponent such as elyhim I feel my best chances lie playing the white side of this system.
348,16,2,Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Intending to trade knights followed by Bc6. An interesting idea for white might be Nc2 here I assume its still book but I opt to stick with the most common mainline for now.
349,16,3,1f3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2bp1np1/8/2PBP3/2N2P2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Adds suuport to my centre. It does make my LSB appear quite bad but my pawns aren't fixed at some point later down the track my LSB shouldn't be so boxed in.
350,16,4,1Nd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2bp2p1/8/2PBP3/2N2P2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Broadly speaking black has two ways to handle the position. He can either try to strike at whites center by playing for the violent d5 or b5 pawn breaks. Or he can play with a strategy based around making use of the dark square weaknesses in whites position. This move aims for the latter. To be honest I'm not surprised. Elyhim is a very good strategical/positional player and aiming for favourable endgames by making use of blacks stronger colour complex is very much his style. Basically black wants to exchange DSBs then place a knight on c5 support it with a5 possible bring the quuen to b6 and make use of the weakened dark squares.
351,16,5,1Be3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2bp2p1/8/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 b - -',"I avoid the exchange for a couple of reasons. For one thing I have a space advantage so should look to avoid exchanges. For another an exchange would only be going along with blacks plans. Maybe there is some merit to exchanging DSB if I were going to follow up with an attack against the black king. But to be honest I feel like white should be playing a different strategy which revolves around cintrloibg the center and squeezing black to death/leaving him with no play.
Btw we are still in book here this is still very much theory."
352,16,6,1Nc5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2bp2p1/2n5/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',According to the gameknot engine the main line is 13...a5 but this is consistent with blacks plan. This is a good square for the knight.
353,16,7,1Rac1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2bp2p1/2n5/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 b - -',I think the more common square for the took would be b1 evidently intending to play for pawn advances on the queen side at some point. I opted for this because I had my own ideas about how I wanted to play the position. Here the took adds protection to the knight and is ready to play on the c file if it ever opens up.
354,16,8,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/2bp2p1/p1n5/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - a6',More dark square control and adding support to the knights position.
355,16,9,1b3,b'r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/2bp2p1/p1n5/2P1P3/1PN1BP2/P2QB1PP/2R2RK1 b - -',So black a5 isn't a problem. Bow it could be met with b4
356,16,10,1Rfd1,b'1r1q1rk1/1p2ppbp/2bp2p1/p1n5/2P1P3/1PN1BP2/P2QB1PP/2RR2K1 b - -',Adding extra fire power down the d file. Already I was thinking about possible tactics that could follow for if/when black plays b6
357,16,11,1Nd5,b'1r1q1rk1/4ppbp/1pbp2p1/p1nN4/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/2RR2K1 b - -',Strong square for the knight. Its very strong here holding slot of influence over the board and if black wants to get rid of it then he will need to either give up his LSB leaving me with a lot of space plus great pawn chain and the bishop pair or he will need to play e6 which will weaken the d6 pain and make it a possible target.
358,16,12,1Rb7,b'3q1rk1/1r2ppbp/1pbp2p1/p1nN4/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/2RR2K1 w - -',Planning to contest the d file with Rd7
359,16,13,1Rcb1,b'3q1rk1/1r2ppbp/1pbp2p1/p1nN4/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Maybe the rook belonged here all along but the position has changed a bit now I don't really think I lost any time by not placing it to begin with. I was already planning to meet ...e6 with Nxb6 but black hadn't played it yet. So this move prepares to challenge the knight on c5 by preparing a3/b4. Also it means I can still possible take on b6 if black tries 18...Rd7 19.a3 e6 20.Nxb6!?
360,16,14,1e6,b'3q1rk1/1r3pbp/1pbpp1p1/p1nN4/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',!? I was actually quite surprised that black went for this variation. Possibly he missed my next move or perhaps he was ready to embrace the complications and felt that the resulting position presented black with good chances. Right now white has two options to drop my knight back and play against the weakened d6 pawn or...
361,16,15,1Nxb6,b'3q1rk1/1r3pbp/1Nbpp1p1/p1n5/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',To dive head first into the complications. Practically speaking I think this offers white the best winning chances especially given the rating disparity. I want give all my analysis as I think too much variations and reams of analysis to go through can be quite dry. But the line I was expecting/hoping for was 19...Qxb6 20.Qxd6 Nxe4 21.Qxf1+! (An important intermizzo) Bxf1 22.Bxb6 Nc3 24.Bxa5 Nxe2+ 25.Kf1 and I think white has good chances. Instead elyhim came up with a move I overlooked which on a practical aspect is probably more speaking than Qxb6
362,16,16,1Be5,b'3q1rk1/1r3p1p/1Nbpp1p1/p1n1b3/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 w - -',Taking the fight to white and not going with my agenda. Now Bxc5 is going to be met with Qh4 and attacking chances against whites king.
363,16,17,2Bxc5,b'3q1rk1/1r3p1p/1Nbpp1p1/p1B1b3/2P1P3/1P3P2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Again I won't offer reams of analysis. But needles to say I was looking through a lot of lines here. During the game I thought this move was forced incidently I didnt even see Na5 until after playing this. Na5 I think offers white a safe albeit very slight edge. The move played is objectivly the strongest but does offer black attacking chances. After some thought I think I had found the way to force at least a draw.
364,16,18,2Bxd6,b'5rk1/1r3p1p/1NbBp1p1/p3b3/2P1P2q/1P3P2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 b - -',In a lot of way this move brings some mixed emotions. This move forces the draw a great result against such a strong opponent. However on the other hand I have the advantage here and in settling for a draw I may have thrown away a rare chance at fighting for a win against a ~2500 rated opponent! I can't help but feeling like this is chickening out in a way. The alternative was to play g3 where we either have 21.g3 Bxg3 22.hxg3 Qxg3+ or 21.g3 Bxg3 Bf1 in both cases White might be the better side but my king would be very exposed with moves like f5 to come I felt taking the easy out as it were would push me over 2000 and that was a good feeling.
365,16,19,2Kf1,b'5rk1/1r3p1p/1NbBp1p1/p3b3/2P1P2q/1P3P2/P2QB1P1/1R1R1K2 b - -',Black has to accept the perpetual now. The only other try to play on would be 24...Rd8 where I had planned 25.Bxe5! Rxd2 26.Rxd2 Rxd6 27.Rbd1 and despite the fact whites playing without the queen I think white is the better side and the only one with winning chances. I was rather hoping black would go for it.

This is a genuine case of a game of two halves. It was a ladder game which resulted from a challenge from armorpawn. I find it's common in ladders to get challenges from much higher rated players my challenge in these cases is to give them something to think about. The action starts with the English opening."

Here h6 saved the day for some more move but I could do nothing against Kh1-g4-g5. White is playing preparing for a knight's jump. It forces me to save my own knight of f7. If I go something like h6 white can play Ne8. I can take it but then white will take mine on f7 and with a rook there I'm doomed.   It's interesting to try to find an escape (28...h6 29. Ne8 Qg6 30. QxQ NxQ 31. RxNf7 RxR 32 RxRf7). But in attacking this way white omits a black's move...

The knight on h1 is cutting off the f2 square from my king.  And now the rook enters the fray.  I'm going to have to play very precisely to pull this off.

642,25,8,Bd4,b'3r2k1/pQ3p2/5r2/4p3/3b3P/3P1nP1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Be3+ drives the king further into a corner and permits Nd2+ though the black knight's range of motion remains restricted by white's rooks.
643,25,9,Rfd6,b'3r2k1/p3Qp2/3r4/4p3/3b3P/3P1nP1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',I like Rdd6 better.  While the queen can push the black king around this lets the black rooks roam the entire field instead of just the d file.
644,25,10,2Qb7,b'3r2k1/pQ3p2/3r4/4p3/3b3P/3P1nP1/PPP5/2KR3R b - -',This seems like a mistake.  Rb6 encourages 27. Qxa7 Bxb2+.  The white king must respond with Kb1 in which case black responds with Bd4+ and the white queen falls.  The white queen has to move to some white square invisible to the black bishop or a black square it cannot cover from b2 in one move.  This makes black's Bd4 a pretty good move in hindsight.  On the other hand instead of Qxa7 white is probably eying Nf3.  Black should drive the white king into the corner with the bishop and knight combo.
645,25,11,Rb6,b'6k1/p2r1p2/1r6/4p3/3b3P/3P1QP1/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',While this may meet black's immediate goal black should ask himself what white's next move might be besides simply taking the knight.  Rd7 is undefended with this move and Qg4+ relieves black of an important rook.
646,25,12,2c3,b'6k1/p2r1p2/1r6/4p3/3b3P/2PP1QP1/PP6/2KR3R b - -',Without a threat to the queen Rb6 was easily defended against.

32... Nxd4 33. Bxc3 Nxc2 34. Bb2 and black has not much to show with the extra pawn. White will eventually exchange the light-square bishop for the knight leaving only opposite-colored bishops on the board an easy draw.

32... Nxa4 33. Bxc3 Nxc2 seems better but the knight can't avoid being exchanged for the light-square bishop. For example 34. Kf2 Kf7 35. Bd3 Na3 36. Ke3 Bb5 is tricky but 37. Bb2! forces opposite-colored bishops endgame.

It looks like a perfectly decent move to me except that h6 encourages a bishop/knight swap otherwise Nxe4.
846,36,5,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2b2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This move finally abandons the database.  c3 (which blocks the knight's advance to the field) is more commonly played.
847,36,6,1Bd3,b'r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2PB1Q2/P1P2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Although Pxe4 forks white's bishop and queen. the pawn is covered by a rook so the fork is plastic instead of steel.  It would be just a simple pawn trade but then black could follow with Pf5 or Bf5 pinning the bishop against the king.  White has nothing else to protect the bishop trapped on e4 at that point.
848,36,7,Rh6,b'r1b3k1/p1p2ppp/2pq3r/3P4/8/2PB1Q2/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Ah black moves in for a quick kill.  15 move game.

851,36,10,d4,b'r5k1/p1p2p1p/2r1b1p1/4R3/3p4/1RPB4/P1P2PPP/6K1 w - -',Black uncovers a threat to the white rook while leaving his own rooks vulnerable to a pin by white's bishop.
852,36,11,2Be4,b'r5k1/p1p2p1p/2r1b1p1/4R3/3pB3/1RP5/P1P2PPP/6K1 b - -',...just like that.  Black will lose the bishop if he takes the rook though.
853,36,12,2Bd5,b'3r4/p1p2pkp/6p1/3BR3/3p4/1PP5/2P2PPP/6K1 b - -',Oops black wins white's bishop with Pf6.  The rook has to move off the rank--possibly Re7+.  But Kf6 or Kf7 leaves white with no way to guard against RxBd5.
854,36,13,2Bc4,b'8/p1p2pkp/3r2p1/4R3/2Bp4/1PP5/2P2PPP/6K1 b - -',Now the bishop is safe and the king need not worry about Rd1# (which black would require several moves to set up).
855,36,14,Kg7,b'8/p1p2pkp/3r2p1/2R5/2B5/1Pp3P1/2P2P1P/6K1 w - -',?  This does not protect against Rxc7.  And after that Pa7 falls.
856,36,15,2Bd3,b'8/p1R2pkp/5rp1/8/8/1PpB2P1/2P2P1P/6K1 b - -',...or Pc3.  I prefer Rxa7 here as Pc3's advance is blocked.  White can then promote Pb3 which enjoys a pretty clear path.
