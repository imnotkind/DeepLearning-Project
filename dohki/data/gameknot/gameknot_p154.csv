0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',Pretty standard opening for the Queen's pawn game. 
1,0,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the most popular option for black you create an easy pocket to the attack the center pawn and you open the door for an easy king side castle. 
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 is a good counter I think white developments further and covers the center. 
3,0,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Preparing the castle but move is not as threatening. 
4,0,4,Be2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',white responds by opening the door to his own king side castle. Be2 is better than Be3 because black can no longer pin the knight with Bg4. 
5,0,5,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',As predicted.

7,0,7,Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This is I think the first mistake black makes. Nc6 would cutoff e5 which is where I want to push the offensive: right down the center. 
8,0,8,dxe5,b'r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/5np1/4P1B1/6b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',From here on in things start to get messy. 
9,0,9,Ne8,b'r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/6b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I think this move is also a mistake Nh5 would be a better option because black doesn't have to surrender the initiative so much.   
10,0,10,1Nd4,b'r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/3N2b1/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',The pawn is not worth so much but e6 fx6 Nx6 leaves white in a pretty good place... or so it seems. If black takes the pawn he removes a strategic threat but loses the bishop. Again the foresight of Be2 queen and bishop combinations work well together. But it was not meant to be; I made a mistake here. From here on in black puts together a good combination to get the pawn off the table

15,0,15,1Rfd1,b'r2qnrk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4n1B1/3N4/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',I am down material but perhaps wining in terms of position.

20,0,20,Kxf8,b'r3nk2/pp2p2p/2p3p1/4b1p1/8/2N5/PPP3PP/R2R2K1 w - -',This sequence of moves evens us out material. Black did a good job here of preventing me from establishing a blow out lead in material. Still white is better because of black's messy pawn structure on the right. 
21,0,21,2Re6,b'r3nk2/pp2p2p/2p1Rbp1/6p1/8/2N5/PPP3PP/R5K1 b - -',Mistake on my part. The rook can't do anything here.. basically threw the move away.

24,0,24,2Rb1,b'3rn3/pp2pk1p/2p2bp1/6p1/8/2N5/PPP1R1PP/1R4K1 b - -',Mistake again but not a vital one. Rd1 is the best move this was just a plan to free up the knight. 
25,0,25,2c3,b'3r4/pp2pk2/2pn2pp/6p1/3bN3/2P5/PP2R1PP/1R5K b - -',pressure on the bishop; still jockeying for position in this middle game stage. 
26,0,26,2Nxd6+,b'3r4/pp2pk2/2pN1bpp/6p1/8/2P5/PP2R1PP/1R5K b - -',with the pawn moved out bishop can't do as much damage. I decided getting a knight off the table was a better move. 
27,0,27,2Kg1,b'3r4/pp3k2/2pp1bpp/6p1/8/2P5/PP2R1PP/1R4K1 b - -',I will soon trade away for the other rook recognizing that I wanted to get the king moving.

32,0,32,3Re7+,b'5r2/pp2R1k1/2p3p1/6pp/8/2b3P1/P4RKP/8 b - -',This move is very important it allows white to trap the king on the ole 8' and allow white's king a free hand against those pawns. 
33,0,33,3Rxb7,b'5k2/pR6/2p3p1/6pp/8/2b3P1/P5KP/8 b - -',equalizing. 
34,0,34,3Ke4,b'5k2/pR6/1bp3p1/6pp/4K3/6P1/P6P/8 b - -',the bishop can cover one and only one spot. white can get rid of the c pawn but this frees up the king. The better option is to remove those pesky right side pawns. 
35,0,35,4Re4,b'5k2/p7/1b3Kp1/6pp/2p1R3/6P1/P6P/8 b - -',Black's king is still trapped. 
36,0,36,4Rc4,b'5k2/p7/1b3Kp1/6pp/2R5/2p3P1/P6P/8 b - -',the pawn frees the king up finally but white's king is already in position. 
37,0,37,4g5,b'8/p4k2/8/b4KP1/2R5/2p5/P7/8 b - -',the bishop is stuck to the pawn; which works just fine. I push the pawn into black territory.

39,0,39,5Rd6,b'3b4/6k1/3R2P1/p4K2/P7/8/8/8 b - -',The position is still difficult for white to resolve. The bishop can keep dancing around squares and even Rd7 won't quite resolve the matter. 
40,0,40,5Be7,b'8/4b1k1/3R2P1/p4K2/P7/8/8/8 w - -',Black hands white a big opportunity; pinning the bishop.

210,11,0,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq c6',The semi-tarrasch isn't an opening that I am particularly booked up on. I very rarely get it due to the Nf3 move order and as a general rule active play is normally enough to at least maintain the balance (apologies to any semi-tarrasch players)
211,11,1,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/4pn1p/2pp2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This was unexpected. To be honest at the time I felt that it must be downright inaccurate and very well may be but I struggled to an extent. The only sensible continuation at this point is Bxf6 Qxf6 cxd5 as otherwise I felt as if some of the purpose behind Bg5 was misguided.
212,11,2,cxd5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/4pq1p/2pP4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Winning a pawn and at the same time rapidly liquidating the centre
213,11,3,cxd4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/4pq1p/3P4/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This move is best as after exd5 dxc5 Bxc5 e3 Black will be a pawn down with a very vulnerable isolated queen's pawn
214,11,4,Bb4,b'rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/4p2p/3P4/1b1N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',An interesting move which I probably don't respond to very accurately. In hindsight dxe6 is by fr and away the best move where it isn't too relevant that Black can give White an isolated pawn on c3 as he will have his own weakling on e6. Sadly the aesthetics of having a passed pawn on d5 and the c pawn potentially supporting this caused me to play the following.
215,11,5,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp3pp1/7p/3P4/1b1N4/2N5/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black though a pawn down does in fact now have an extent of compensation. The White knights aren't particularly good in spite of the seeming strength of the outposted d4 horseman. This is because there isn't actually any significant threats to be made on the dark squares c7 or e7 in time and the large amount of options for both of Black's bishops mean that the squares controlled by the knight are devalued. Meanwhile the d pawn can be easily attacked by Black and if it drops and material is restored it is likely he will have the better chances thanks to the bishop pair in the open position.
216,11,6,Re8+,b'rnb1r1k1/pp3pp1/7p/3P4/1b1N4/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',An impressive move order by Black. White can now begrudgingly accept a repetition a pawn up with Be2 or retreat his knight and cede the f5 square in which case Black's other bishop comes to life. 
217,11,7,Nd7,b'r1b1r1k1/pp1n1pp1/7p/3P4/1b6/2N2B2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',This is fine as White doesn't have the means of regaining control over f5 before the knight moves to free the light-squared bishop whilst gaining a tempo.
218,11,8,Ne5,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/7p/3Pn3/1b6/2N2B2/PP2NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',This was a bit of a nasty surprise. I had only considered Nf6 and Nb6 applying pressure to the pawn directly. The indirect attack targeting the defending bishop is significantly better as illustrated by the game continuation
219,11,9,Nc4,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/7p/3P4/1bn1B3/2N5/PP2NPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Winning back the pawn due to the double threat of Nxb2 and Nd2. Thankfully it wont be the d pawn that drops however. Whilst Black regains the pawn White gains time to unscramble his pieces and achieve a position with mutual chances
220,11,10,1a3,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/7p/3P4/1bn1B3/P1N5/1P2NPPP/R4RK1 b - -',I felt this was very necessary to avoid being worse. Black now should probably play Bf8 after which Ng3 Nxb2 Nb5 Rd8 Rac1 he will stand marginally better with the bishops if he can find good squares for them. Black opts instead however to maintain some traps which is in itself a perfectly viable option.
221,11,11,1Nxc3,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/7p/3P4/2n1B3/P1N5/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Obviously not bxc3 Ne2

223,11,13,2d6,b'r3r1k1/pp1b1pp1/3P3p/8/4B3/P1N5/1n3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I felt that I had to be dynamic in this position due to the temporary discoordination of Black's knight and a8 rook. In fact though Ra1b1 is just the better move. It looked a bit hairy at first with Nc4 Rb7 in which both Nd6 and potential backrow mate tricks are in circulation but the tempo on the bishop makes this irrelevant and White will have regained his pawn with a winning position. Disappointingly though this entire branch was missed during the game.
224,11,14,2Bxc6,b'r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2BP3p/8/8/P1N5/1n3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I had convinced myself that the c6 pawn would be weak when deep down I knew that this was completely untrue due to their being no imminent means of attacking it and in fact control over d5 and b5 is significantly more relevant.
225,11,15,2d7,b'r3r1k1/p2P1pp1/2p4p/8/8/P1N5/1n3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I had quite a think before this move. The other main candidate was Rxe8+ Rxe8 d7 after which Rb1 (Re1 Kf8 gives White a lost position as Black's knight will round up the pawn with via c4-b6) Nc4 (Rxd7 does not work as the night covers d1) Rb7 where Nxa3 looks full of possibilities in which White sacks a pawn with Na4 playing for Nc5 and Rc8. Sadly though instead on Nxa3 if Black plays Nb6 the line simplifies into a dead level position. Therefore in the adventurous spirit of the game d7 was played with optimistic (misguided) ideas initially of Re7 Kf8 Re1 followed by routing the Knight to d6 with a won game.
226,11,16,2Re2,b'r2r2k1/p2P1pp1/2p4p/8/8/P1N5/1n2RPPP/R5K1 b - -',I realised fortuitously at this point that Re7 Kf8 Re1 Nd3 leaves White busted as he must waste a tempo moving the e1 rook after which Nc5 picks up the d pawn. The position now is quite edgy and in all honesty probably slightly better for Black. This next move though is a complete blunder
227,11,17,2Rab8,b'1r1r2k1/p2P1pp1/2p4p/8/8/P1N5/1n2RPPP/R5K1 w - -',I imagine Black had missed that after Rb1 Rxd7 R2xb2 Rxb2 Rxb2 that he wouldn't have mate on d1 due to the knight on c3. Black now loses at least a piece.
228,11,18,Nc4,b'1r1r2k1/p2P1pp1/2p4p/8/2n5/P1N5/4RPPP/1R4K1 w - -',Making a bad situation a lot worse

I figured that he would be tempted with Qxb2 partly to equalise on material but also because it means that his c and b pawns look a lot more threatening then.

520,28,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So into the Benoni-Benko systems. White has a slight space advantage. But will play his Bf8 to g7 and try to build up pressure along the long black diagonal combined with play on the Queen's side. White may try for a large break through in the centre and/or a king side attack. It is quite unbalanced which is why it is popular. According to the stats 2.....c5 leads to less draws and more wins for both White and Black.
521,28,3,cxb5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So Dave goes for what the English-speaking world call the Benko Gambit after Pal Benko a Hungarian-American Grandmaster who provided many of the ideas. In other countries it is known as the Volga Gambit. Black gives up a pawn on the Queen side. The idea is to get open a and b files which combined with the Bg7 can give overwhelming pressure on the Queen side. The advanatages of this system is that Black's initiative and pressure can last well into the endgames and can continue even if a number of pieces have been exchanged. It is also a relatively easy system to play for Black.
522,28,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/p4n2/1PpP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I prefer this to just falling in with Black's idea by taking the second pawn. There are some interesting lines here such as 5. Nc3 axb5 6. e4 b4 7. Nb5 Nxe4 8. Qe2 (if Black moves the knight White has Nd6 mate!) f5 9. f3 Ra5 10. fxe4 Ba6 11. exf5 Bxb5 12. Qh5+ g6 13. fxg6 Bg7 14. gxh7+ Kf8 with advantage to white. Zontakh Andrey (2545) vs. Milanovic Dani… (2420) and Sauleda Roig J… (2152) vs. Fiol Company J… (2189). White won both games.
523,28,5,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1PpP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',So I grab the centre and give further protection to my pawn on b5.

If White takes the knight with the Queen Black can exchange on c3 and then pick up the Bishop on b5 and if White recaptures the knight on e4 with his knight then Black plays c4 which puts White in Check and then he can play Queen takes bishop next move.

Computer actually likes 15. exd5. What do you think dear reader?

Certainly the knight on d7 doesn't seem to have many prospects and comes under fire down the d file. I wanted to make sure that there were no sacrifices on e5 - he may well have been loking at giving up a piece for 2 pawns on e5 to free his position.
537,28,19,2Bxd5,b'r4rk1/3n2bp/3Np1p1/2pBP3/1q3P2/8/PP2Q1PP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Now if he takes back with the pawn which is probably best I was going to play Qg4 hitting the knight on d7 and also with ideas of playing Qe6 check followed by Nf7 check picking up the exchange. Computer actually prefers to follow up with 21. Rd1 and thinks White has a decisive advantage because after 21. Qg4 Black has Qd4 check and if Kh1 Black can then take the pawn on e5 with either knight or Queen as there is a pin on the f4 pawn and if White captures on e5 there is Rf8xRf1 mate! Or if instead Rf2 Black has Nxe5 and there is still a pin on the f4 pawn. However Black decides to throw in the Queen check immediately.

583,31,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is probably one of my better wins though White did throw it away at the end.  I had some fairly interesting plays this game.  Lets start with the typical opening.  e4
584,31,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My typical response to e4 after I learned to play the Sicilian back 4 years ago.
585,31,2,b4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/1P2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',The wing gambit the only gambit that I can recall of the top of my head for the Sicilian defense.  I believe the idea is for white to try to keep his d-pawn.  White should be able to almost always form the ideal pawn center with this opening.  I see no reason to not accept this sacrifice.
586,31,3,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/1p2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',white plans on opening the file for his rook and allowing the development of the dsb to the a3-f8 diagonal where it plays influence on the development of the e pawn due to the somewhat undermining Bxf8 Kxf8.  I decided that I don't like that plan so instead I decide to start my move on the center and develop if axb4 with the move e6.
587,31,4,c3,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1b2P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.
588,31,5,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/4P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I decided on this move because I wanted to set a solid defense with a Scheveningen style structure for black.  Whites central pawns will end up marching at some point via e5 or d5.  So I plan on having my bishops in a defensive style for the moment and what for my chance to counter attack.
589,31,6,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Attempting to get white to play e5 so d6 can come with a possible pawn exchange not to mention if I can get my knight set up on d5 could be good for me.  The downside to this move order is white has the potential to increase the squeeze on black.  Example being e5 Nd5 c4 Nc7 where black plans d6 or d5 in order to break things open.
590,31,7,d6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB4/5PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Adopting my counterattacking structure. I feel fairly flexible with this set up.
591,31,8,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',I want to get my king away from potential checks along the e8-a4 diagonal though Bd7 was also possible I have the idea of possibly moving my bishop to b7 instead to attack d5 and put pressure on e4.  Keeping the flexibility alive.
592,31,9,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3PP3/N1PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Taking back control of the b5 square though I feel that my pawns will be weak after my eventual b5.
593,31,10,b5,b'r1bq1rk1/3nbppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3PP3/N1PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - b6',? in hindsight I forgot about the pin on the a8 rook though I didn't have a whole lot of choice I could have played b6 first maybe.  The point being I want to get my bishop into the action and fast.
594,31,11,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b1nbppp/p2ppn2/1N6/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Now white must expend a tempo to keep the knight.  I haven't lost my passed pawn as of yet. which I would believe blacks advantage at the moment.
595,31,12,Qc7,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/8/3PP3/N1PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Development and attack of the c3 pawn.  Black is now ready to begin the attack on the center that I have been preparing for.
596,31,13,e5,b'r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2PPP3/N2B1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',My idea was to exchange on d4 or have the possibility of playing Nc5 to attack whites bishop on c3 and possible win the e4 pawn.  If white decides to close down the center with d5 I can play Nc5 and eventually have the plan of f5 to bust open the center.
597,31,14,Rab8,b'1r3rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2PPP3/N2B1N2/1B3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',I feel that having the potential to attack the bishop on b2 could be good for me. I also have the possible plan of unbalancing the position which you will see in a few more moves.

I think I may slightly favor white in that position.  But I thought that white may have the better of it when I played Bxe4 but I couldn't resist. 
607,31,24,2Qd2,b'1r3rk1/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/8/2PN4/N2b1P2/1B1Q2PP/R3R1K1 b - -',White's decision attempts to make everything work out well for him.  If Bxc4 Nxc4 and I'm in big trouble.  It keeps the defense of the dsb and if white gets to many move he may find a way to defend everything.

613,31,30,2Nf5,b'5rk1/5ppp/p4n2/3p1N2/2q5/Q4P2/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',I was seeing sparks from white here with the interesting combination attempt Ne7+ Kh8 Ng6+ winning the rook on f8. I can't move my rook via e8 or c8 due to the nasty fork Nd6. 
614,31,31,2g6,b'5rk1/5p1p/p4np1/3p1N2/2q5/Q4P2/6PP/1R4K1 w - -',?! I don't like this move now my idea was that once white plays Ne7 I could defend with Kg7.

771,39,19,Qb3+,b'1r4k1/Q4pp1/P6p/2pp4/8/1qP5/KP1R3P/8 w - -',Alekhine resigns. The finish would be 36 K-R1 (or K-N1) R-K1 and mate follows on the back rank unless Alekhine gives up his Rook with 37 R-Q1 QxR ch 38 K-R2 which would of course leave him hopelessly behind in material.
