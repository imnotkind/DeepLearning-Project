17,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My favorite first move.
18,1,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He responds normally.
19,1,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I was trying something new so I decided to play g3 early.
20,1,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He opens up his knight protecting his pawn from any threats.
21,1,4,Bg2,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I get my bishop out of the way for castling.
22,1,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',He opens up his other knight - what I would usually do.
23,1,6,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I decided to try to persuade him to take my pawn then threaten his knight repeatedly but…
24,1,7,a5,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/2n2n2/p3p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq a6',…He doesn't take my pawn but instead pushes up his pawn on the wing up two squares something that I think is pointless.
25,1,8,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/2n2n2/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I threaten his pawn on e5 while being protected by my knight on f3 and my queen.
26,1,9,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/2np1n2/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',He protects his pawn using another one of his pawns.
27,1,10,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/2np1n2/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle.
28,1,11,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2p1p/2np1np1/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',He pushes up his pawn same as I did on my second move.
29,1,12,Re1,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp2p1p/2np1np1/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I protect my pawn with my rook.
30,1,13,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2p1p/2npbnp1/p3p3/3PP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',He opens up his bishop. I do this often.
31,1,14,d5,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2p1p/2npbnp1/p2Pp3/4P3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I fork his knight and bishop with my pawn. :D
32,1,15,Nd4,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2p1p/3pbnp1/p2Pp3/3nP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',He threatens my knight but it's easier for me to take his bishop with my pawn rather then taking the knight.
33,1,16,dxe6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2p1p/3pPnp1/p3p3/3nP3/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',I take his bishop.
34,1,17,Nxf3+,b'r2qkb1r/1pp2p1p/3pPnp1/p3p3/4P3/5nP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',He takes my knight with his own and I am now in check.

36,1,19,1fxe6,b'r2qkb1r/1pp4p/3ppnp1/p3p3/4P3/5BP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',And he takes my free pawn. But notice that the other pawn is right in front of him. Now both of his e can't move anywhere.
37,1,20,1Nc3,b'r2qkb1r/1pp4p/3ppnp1/p3p3/4P3/2N2BP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I open my knight… Finally.

40,1,23,1Rg8,b'r2qkbr1/2p4p/1p1ppnp1/p3p3/4P3/2N1BBP1/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w q -',Not a great move. It isn't doing anything except preventing him from castling unless he wants to open up his rook.
41,1,24,1Bg5,b'r2qkbr1/2p4p/1p1ppnp1/p3p1B1/4P3/2N2BP1/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b q -',I pin the knight with my bishop.

45,1,28,1Nb5,b'r3kbr1/2p5/1p1ppqpp/pN2p3/4P3/5BP1/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b q -',I threaten: Nc7.

50,1,33,1Kc8,b'2kr1br1/2p5/1pNppqpp/p3p3/4P3/5BP1/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 w - -',He moves his king out of the way and I happily capture his rook.

57,1,40,2Qa4,b'2kq2r1/2p1b3/1p1pp1p1/p3p2p/QP2P3/2P2BP1/P4P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',Now I'm really threatening his pawn.

Believe it or not I didn't actually checkmate him here in the blitz game. I actually played: Bc4! :D But then I won his rook and he reigned. Apart from not checkmating him in the blitz game that was a great game!
"
74,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My opponent opens with d4.  I myself use the queen's gambit when white so I feel that this is a strong opening move.
75,2,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Play continues..
76,2,2,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P3P/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq h3',h4? white's first questionable move.  Now I'm sure theres a purpose to this but I don't see it.. maybe to defend his bishop soon to be on g5 but his bishop stays put costing white a tempo.
77,2,3,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P3P/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',As I mentioned before I use the queen's gambit so I am now in a position I am very comfortable in as black.
78,2,4,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/1p2p3/2pp4/N2P3P/8/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',White's knight is not threatening to me and allows me to free up my light squared bishop without losing tempo.
79,2,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/1p1bp3/2pp4/N2P3P/1P6/P1P1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Now I can develop without having to worry about his pesky pawns.
80,2,6,c4,b'rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/1p1bp3/2pp4/N1PP3P/1P6/P3PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq c3',It looks like he wants to break up the centre which is fine with me.
81,2,7,dxc5,b'r1bqk2r/p3nppp/1pnbp3/2Pp4/N1P4P/1P2P3/P4PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I do not feel that this is in his best interest as I am much more developed than him and if we trade off pawns I will have centre control with all my big pieces.
82,2,8,Nxd5,b'r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2nbp3/2pn4/N6P/1P2P3/P4PP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Capturing with my knight made it incredibly powerful. Just look at all the dark squares my centre three pieces are attacking.
83,2,9,1g4,b'r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2nbp3/2pn4/N5PP/1P2P3/P4P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq g3',Don't even ask..
84,2,10,1Bb7,b'r2qk2r/pb3ppp/2nbp3/2pn4/N5PP/1P2P3/P4P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A very good spot for my bishop.
85,2,11,1Nxc5,b'r2qk2r/pb3ppp/2nbp3/2Nn4/6PP/1P2P3/P4P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Nc5??? What a blunder! Trading his only developed piece for an isolated pawn?
86,2,12,1Bxc5,b'r2qk2r/pb3ppp/2n1p3/2bn4/6PP/1P2P3/P4P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Just look at my development compared to white's.
87,2,13,1e4,b'r2qk2r/pb3ppp/2n1p3/2bn4/4P1PP/1P6/P4P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Should've done that while your knight was still protecting c3.
88,2,14,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/pb3ppp/2n1p3/2b5/4P1PP/1Pn5/P4P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Attacking the queen and threatening checkmate.
89,2,15,1Qxd8+,b'r2Qk2r/pb3ppp/2n1p3/2b5/4P1PP/1Pn5/P4P2/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',NOT a good time to trade queens.
90,2,16,1Rxd8,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/2n1p3/2b5/4P1PP/1Pn5/P4P2/R1B1KBNR w KQk -',Now another powerful piece joins the attack! White looks to be in trouble here.
91,2,17,1Rc1,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n2n1PP/1P3N2/PB3P2/2R1KB1R b Kk -',He sees my threatened fork and moves to defend..
92,2,18,1Rg1,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P3N2/PB3n2/2R1KBR1 b k -',.. but he should have moved Rh2..
93,2,19,1Nfd3+,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P1n1N2/PB6/2R1KBR1 w k -',.. because this three-pronged fork and discovered attack on the rook leaves him in a much worse position than before.
94,2,20,1Kd1,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P1n1N2/PB6/2RK1BR1 b k -',Now would you take the bishop or the rook?
95,2,21,1Nxb2+,b'3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P3N2/Pn6/2RK1BR1 w k -',The bishop of course and it soon become clear why.
96,2,22,Ba6+,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/b3p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P3N2/Pn2K3/2R2BR1 w k -',Ba6! Forcing the King back to e1.
97,2,23,Nb2d3+,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/b3p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P1n1N2/P7/2R1KBR1 w k -',.. look familiar?
98,2,24,2Bxa6,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/B3p3/8/1n4PP/1P3N2/P7/2K3b1 b k -',With Nxg1 I would win a free bishop on f2..
99,2,25,Nxa6,b'3rk2r/p4ppp/n3p3/8/6PP/1P2bN2/PK6/8 w k -',.. but the result is the same.
100,2,26,O-O,b'3r1rk1/p4ppp/n3p3/8/P5PP/1P2bN2/1K6/8 w - -',Now it is not long before his impending doom.
101,2,27,2Ne5,b'3r1r2/p4ppk/n3p3/2b1N2P/P6P/1P6/1K6/8 b - -',Careless..
102,2,28,Bxe5,b'3r1r2/p4ppk/n3p3/4b2P/P6P/KP6/8/8 w - -',And white understandably resigns.
103,3,0,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is so far a fairly standard opening.
104,3,1,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This however is not a very common move. 3. Nc3 is often played instead developing with tempo.
105,3,2,Qa5+,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This would be black's standard response to 3. Nc3. Here however I think black can improve with 3. ...e5! liquidating the central pawns.
106,3,3,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/1q6/8/3P4/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',This doesn't blunder the b2 pawn. If black takes with 5. ...Qxb2?! then white can continue 6. Nc3! threatening to play Rb1 followed by Nb5 and Nxc7+ so black's best reply is 6. ...Qb6 (moving the queen yet again in the opening!) and white can rush out his pieces quickly for an attack and gain ample compensation for the pawn.
107,3,4,e6,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/8/3P2b1/2B2N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',I think 6. ...c6?! left black at a disadvantage. 6. ...Qe6+!? looks like a better try as 7. Be2 is met with 7. ...Bxf3 and 7. Qe2 blocks in white's bishop slows down castling kingside and buys black time to develop with 7. ...Nc6. If 8. Qxe6 then Bxe6 is fine for black.
108,3,5,1O-O,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1q1P2b1/5N2/PPPNBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Once again the b2 pawn is poisoned and black should not capture it. If black does take with 10 ...Qxb2? then it is punished by 11. Nc4! Qc3 (11. ...Qb4 12. Rb1) 12. Nd6+ Ke7 (Kf8 has the same reply Kd7 is met with Ne4 followed by Ne5+ and black drops a bishop Kc8 loses to Nxf7+) 13. Ng5! Bf5 14. Ndxf7 and black quickly loses
109,3,6,1Nf6,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1q1P2b1/5N2/PPPNBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',However black resists the urge to grab material and correctly carries on developing

111,3,8,1c3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/1q1P2b1/1NP2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',correctly kicking away the invasive queen whilst supporting his center
112,3,9,1h3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pqpn2/8/3P2b1/1NP2N1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',trying to kick away the black bishop. black's reply is very interesting
113,3,10,1h5,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn2/7p/3P2b1/1NP2N1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq h6',!? I would have played either Bxf3 or Bh5. Its hard to judge if this is sound but I think this is at least playable. White should NOT continue 14. hxg4? because black replies hxg4 and the white knight can't move because of Qh2# and black would then win back his piece and have a nice attack along the h file. White should instead reply something like 14. Qd2 trying to involve his queen in the defence.
114,3,11,1a4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn2/7p/P2P2b1/1NP2N1P/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq a3',A useless gesture on the queenside that does nothing to help prevent black's attack

116,3,13,1g3,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/2pqpn2/6pp/P2P4/1NP2BPP/1P3P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I don't like this move which seems to only further weaken the white kingside. Maybe white should begin attacking on the queenside?
117,3,14,hxg4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/2pqpn2/8/P2P2p1/1NP2BP1/1P3P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Now white should play 18. Bg2 with a slight advantage for black. However the poisoned pawn is back although this time on g4!
118,3,15,1Bxg4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/2pqpn2/8/P2P2B1/1NP3P1/1P3P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Blunder. White can't resist the urge to grab material.
119,3,16,1Nxg4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/2pqp3/8/P2P2n1/1NP3P1/1P3P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',the correct response by black
120,3,17,1Qxg4,b'r3k2r/pp1n1p2/2pqp3/8/P2P2Q1/1NP3P1/1P3P2/R4RK1 b kq -',Now it seems white is just a pawn up so what is black to do? There is a brutal move: 19. ...Qd5!! and the queen radiates power across the whole board and white can already resign! The point is that black is threatening mate on h1 and there are only 2 ways to avoid this:  20. f3 and 20. f4. The point being that both of them allow 20. ...Qxb3 and white is a piece down with an exposed kingside!
121,3,18,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1n1p2/2pqp3/8/P2P2Q1/1NP3P1/1P3P2/R4RK1 w - -',Throwing away the win. Black can still draw from here by making use of the h file and central play but black fails to find the correct plan and gradually slips into a losing position. So near yet so far!
122,3,19,Nf6,b'2kr3r/pp3p2/2pqpn2/8/P2P2Q1/2P3P1/1P1N1P2/R4RK1 w - -',A bad move by black. Instead 20. ...e5! looks better and allows black to get active pieces as compensation for his pawn.
123,3,20,2Qf3,b'2kr3r/pp3p2/2pqpn2/8/P2P4/2P2QP1/1P1N1P2/R4RK1 b - -',Now however the knight gets attacked and white uses the gained time to exchange rooks.
124,3,21,2Kg2,b'2k3rr/pp3p2/2pqpn2/8/P2P4/2P2QP1/1P1N1PK1/R4R2 b - -',Black was threatening Rxg3+
125,3,22,Qxh6,b'2k5/pp3p2/2p1pn1q/8/P2P4/2P2QP1/1P1N1PK1/8 w - -',Now black is in serious trouble as without rooks there is less chances for counterplay
126,3,23,2fxe3,b'2k5/pp3p2/2p1pn2/8/P2P4/2P1P1P1/1P1N2K1/8 b - -',Now after the queen exchange the extra pawn makes itself felt
127,3,24,3Kf4,b'8/pp1k1p1n/2p1p3/8/P2P1K2/2P1P1P1/1P1N4/8 b - -',White begins by activating his king - a good start in many endgames.
128,3,25,b6,b'8/p2k3n/1pp1pp2/8/P2PNK2/2P1P1P1/1P6/8 w - -',black's best try is to attempt to keep the black king away from his pawns  or to try to get all the pawns on one side. white knows this and creates holes in the black position before exchanging. black is lost with correct play at this point.
129,3,26,Nf8,b'5n2/p2k4/1pp1p3/5pN1/PP1P1K2/2P1P1P1/8/8 w - -',Exchanging knights would only make the situation worse
130,3,27,3Kf2,b'8/p2k1N2/1pp3n1/5p2/PPPPp3/4P1P1/5K2/8 b - -',white's king is temporarily forced back but black's kingside structure is now no longer flexible and is a target for the white knight
131,3,28,Kc7,b'8/2k1nN2/2p5/p4p2/P1PPp3/4P1P1/5K2/8 w - -',The king goes to plug the queenside hole
132,3,29,Ne7,b'8/2k1n3/2p5/p1P1Np2/P2Pp3/4P1P1/5K2/8 w - -',black has nothing better than shuffling his pieces around while white gradually improves his position
133,3,30,4g4,b'8/2k1n3/2p5/p1P1Np2/P2Pp1P1/4P3/3K4/8 b - -',isolating the e4 pawn is a good idea as it is easier to attack
134,3,31,Nxc3,b'8/2k5/2p5/p1P5/P2Pp3/2n1P3/3K4/8 w - -',Nf6 was a more stubborn way to defend
135,3,32,5Ke2,b'8/8/2p1k3/p1P5/P2Pp3/4P3/4K3/8 b - -',white now rushes to attack the e4 pawn
136,3,33,Kf5,b'8/8/2p5/p1P2k2/P2Pp3/4P1K1/8/8 w - -',black would like to play 54. ...Kg5 but this loses to 55. d5! and if black takes on d5 then the c pawn queens

140,3,37,6Kc2,b'8/8/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/p7/k1K5/8 b - -',black was threatening kb1
141,3,38,a2,b'8/8/2p1P3/2P5/3P4/8/p1K5/k7 w - -',now white can't play 66. e7? as then it would be stalemate!
142,3,39,6d5,b'8/8/2p1P3/2PP4/8/8/p1K5/k7 b - -',an excellent move giving black a move
143,3,40,6e8=Q,b'4Q3/8/8/2P5/3p4/8/p1K5/k7 b - -',now the queen mops up black's pawns and its game over however there was a faster win
144,3,41,Kb1,b'4Q3/8/8/2P5/8/3p4/p2K4/1k6 w - -',Now 70. Qb5+ Ka1 71. Kc3 d2 Qb2# but white misses it. However it doesn't change the outcome of the game.

214,6,5,Ng3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/8/6N1/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Ok.  White's idea is to keep the f-pawn open.  One idea for white that I did not follow is: 4. Nd4!? Bg6 5. f4 e6 6. g4 h7 (Be4? 7. Rg1 with d3 to come) and the question becomes whether the e6 breakthrough will be worth the trouble of the knight being kicked with a timely c5.  Alternatively trying for the pawn sacrifice with 5. e5!? is somewhat less convincing because the bishop controls the diagonal to the king and has moved out of the queenside.  Furthermore the knight on d4 hinders the often useful control of e5 for white making the counter-sac or potentially supported push e5 desirable and freeing at some point.

Best black's seems to be BxBf4 leaving white with the exchange 12. NxRf8 KxN. After it white frees the docks with Nf3. 
But wait: what if black goes after the a1 rook with: 12. NxRf8 Qxb2! ? White goes 13. Nb3 it seems the most sensible move. Black may want to exchange queens then taking the Nf8 and the game proceeds quietey or go for 13.... Qc3+ 14. Kd1 Ne5 after which white is very unconfortable.

black can Rd8 g7 a2 and the situation is similar to actual game.

There is usually a way out of trouble and this is feasible 99.7% of the time according to Jack Stockel.  On the other hand I used to think that there was only one way out of a bad situation and that put me through a ""Fight of Flight"" response. In addition it caused me to be pessimistic and inflexible so I used to make moves that I felt were forced.  However those moves were also loosing blunders in some cases.  Now I remember that there is generally more then one way out of trouble. That is because I remember Jack Stockel's advice to ""Think about things"" and ""there is always another way to do something""... as chesskingdom64 would say.  However there are then better ways to address a problem. The question then becomes the best way.  That is because there is one way that works the best but there are other solutions as well.  After all ""The glass is half full not half empty"" as they say.  Therefore I now try to solve a problem.  Then I try to find a better solution to the problem.  This method is helping me to become a better chess player.  When a problem occurs (due to a blunder or an unexpected position) I view it as an extremely difficult equation with many solutions.  Then I solve the problem by narrowing it down until I find the best solution.  "

White's challenge is to neutralize those pawns and black's challenge is to not trade them away cheaply.
524,16,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Fairly standard progression so far.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
525,16,3,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',This move has good instinct in that it is designed to stake a claim to the center and force me to move my knight.  Any piece that has reach into your side of the board should be viewed with extreme caution.  If you allow pieces to stick around they can have long-term consequences to your game play.
526,16,4,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Instead of retreating I decide to invade a little deeper into Black's territory.  A pair of mutually protected knights is a good thing.
527,16,5,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1N1pp3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq d6',A wrong move here can spell some problems for my side if I'm not careful.  If I choose not to take the d5 pawn then he can advance the pawn one space and force me to move my knight around while staking a strong claim to the center.  However I have three options at this point.  I can take with the knight take with the pawn or move my bishop to g5 to pin his knight against his queen allowing me to move my knight to the d5 square (provided he doesn't pin my own knight with a reciprocal Bb4).  To avoid all of those pin issue I prefer to take with the e pawn.
528,16,6,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Pp3/1n6/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',If black had decided to immediately retake with his f6 knight instead I would have won a knight in the process.  This is an interesting response and I think is worthy of discussion.  As this now stand black has three attackers and I have 2 defenders.  I could potentially move my bishop to c4 to protect but I see problems down that road.  With proper analysis though black is potentially in trouble if I give a little nudge.  
529,16,7,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Pp3/1n6/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Now black has some poor options and ultimately he moves the b knight to retake the d pawn.  If black had instead decided to move to a6 I would have gotten a decent amount of advantage in development and could have added more pressure to his exposed king BUT it would have been better than this move which I will categorize as a mistake.
530,16,8,Nbxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1np3/8/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"if instead Na6...
9.	Qe2	Bd6 (to allow castle)
10.	Nxd6+	Qxd6 (to set up pressure and force an eventual queen trade)
11.	f4	Nd7 (bringing pressure and forcing a knight move to prevent a pawn fork)

13.	Bf4	Qxe2+
14.	Bxe2	O-O

531,16,9,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Np3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Black appears to have an advantage here and can regain his knight however my b5 knight has a nasty surprise waiting.
532,16,10,1Qxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/8/1N1Qp3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I believe that this move is not necessarily one that you would naturally see.  Taking with a queen and leaving it hanging begs it to be taken.
533,16,11,1Nc7+,b'r1b1kb1r/ppN2ppp/8/3qp3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',However the follow through to allow a queen/king split is damning.  Not only has black lost the ability to castle with a very exposed king but now he is down a knight as well.  Not a good place to be if you're black.
534,16,12,Bf5,b'r2k1b1r/pp3ppp/8/3Npb2/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Perhaps it might have been better to move the bishop to e6 and force me to move my knight?  Moving the bishop to f5 invites me to move my knight to the e3 square protecting the c2 pawn and attacking the bishop.
535,16,13,Bd7,b'r2k1b1r/pp1b1ppp/8/4p3/8/P3N3/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Again I think that e6 would have been a better spot for the bishop then black could ahve moved Rc1 to put some pressure on my queenside.  The other downside at this point is that I can potentially pin his bishop against his king.

Bringing additional pieces into the fray is often of greater strategic value and should not be neglected.  Do not throw away the chance to grab a piece or retake just to gain position but do not immediately retake or take because you can.  Analyze the board and see where you can smartly develop an attack.
541,16,19,1Kb6,b'r4b1r/pp1b2pp/1k6/1B2Bp2/4p3/P3N3/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Not many good choices left.
542,16,20,1Bxd7,b'r4b1r/pp1B2pp/1k6/4Bp2/4p3/P3N3/1PP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',Now the king is in a dangerous location since I have four pieces bearing down on his position including two bishops.

Instead of moving pawns in the early middle game bring your pieces into the battle and try and connect your rooks if possible.  Now when Black's king is alone and nearly defenseless it is too late to try and build your defenses.
544,16,22,2Ne3#,b'r4b1r/pp1B2p1/8/4Bp1p/1Pk1p3/P3N3/2P2PPP/2KR3R b - -',"Overall black started out well but perhaps did not see the value of the exchange.  The big mistake was moving the pawn to d5.  With proper play the best response forward would have been

8.	dxc6	Qxd1+
9.	Nxd1	axb5

Although White didn't play very well and dropped his queen to a fairly obvious tactic one of the nice things about the game is that it shows the danger of not developing your pieces and of launching unsupported attacks.  White was able to pull off the victory because Black ended up with all his pieces sidelined either having not moved or having moved away from the scene of the fight.
563,18,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian Defence.  The most popular choice for Black against 1. e4 and something that offers good chances for Black especially against weaker players who don't know quite what to do.  I didn't used to like playing against it but I'm improving.
564,18,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A general developing move that doesn't commit White to anything in particular yet.
565,18,3,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Shredder (and thus the game title) lists this as the Rossolimo Variation with White taking an almost Ruy Lopez-inspired approach.  However we should note that the Rossolimo proper has Bb5 as White's third move and Black replying with 3. ... g6 (neither of which are the case here).  We can probably consider this a transposed move order for White and a deviation from book for Black's next move.
566,18,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Combines general development with an attack on the e4 pawn (which will need further support before it can come to anything).
567,18,5,Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2npbn2/1Bp5/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',As Black has not pursued his attack on e4 White is free to try an attack of his own at d5.
568,18,6,Nxd4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2npbn2/1B6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Of course Black cannot reply 7. ... Nxd4 because that would put the king in check from the bishop.
569,18,7,Nd5,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1B1N4/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Exchanging the knights would allow exd5 with an attack on the knight.  White could also have castled for stronger defence or perhaps played Qe2.
570,18,8,1c4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/3p4/1B1Pn3/2PN4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq c3',Supporting the threatened bishop but also cutting off its lines of retreat. An exchange is the best White can expect if Black tries to pursue it.
571,18,9,1Bxb5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/1b1Pn3/2PN4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black opts for an immediate exchange of the bishops.
572,18,10,1Nxb5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/1N1Pn3/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White is happy with this knight placement with one eye on a hopeful Nc7 if the queen moves before castling.  Black could play a6 to drive the knight back but it wouldn't help his position much otherwise and he might instead consider e5 (especially as White's lack of an lsb offsets the weakeness in his castle created by exchanging pawns on e6.  Black could also try Nxc4 as the pawn is no longer defended.
573,18,11,1Qa5+,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/qN1Pn3/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Instead Black develops the queen with check.  Without the c4 pawn this would have been an excellent attack and could have been usefully preceded by Nxc4.
574,18,12,1Qa4,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1Pn3/Q1P5/8/PP1B1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',White still eyes c7 using the discovered check to pick up the rook.

576,18,14,1Kd1,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1P4/Q1P5/3n4/PP1B1PPP/R2K3R b kq -',?? Ke2 was probably best although Black can still play Nxb2 to some effect.
577,18,15,1Ke2,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1P4/Q1P5/8/Pn1BKPPP/R6R b kq -',White chooses to allow his rooks to connect and to move his king away from the fight on the queenside.
578,18,16,1Rab1,b'r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1P4/n1P5/8/P2BKPPP/1R5R b kq -',White now needs good activity if he is to compensate for the loss of material.  It's fair to say that this should be over if Black gets his pieces together.
579,18,17,1e5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1q1p4/1N1Pp3/n1P5/8/P2BKPPP/1R5R w kq e6',Attempting to activate the centre and the dsb.  g6 might have been better.
580,18,18,1Rb4,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1q1p4/1N1Pp3/nRP5/8/P2BKPPP/7R b kq -',Attacks the knight and allows the rooks to be doubled.  Note that White passes on 17. dxe5 e.p. because the d5 pawn is blocking the d6 pawn which is itself blocking the black dsb.
581,18,19,1Nc5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1q1p4/1NnPp3/1RP5/8/P2BKPPP/7R w kq -',The only available retreat.
582,18,20,1Be3,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1q1p4/1NnPp3/1RP5/4B3/P3KPPP/7R b kq -',Pinning the knight although it is well defended and cannot yet be taken.
583,18,21,1Rhb1,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/qNnPp3/1RP5/4B3/P3KPPP/1R6 b kq -',White could have defended both the a2 pawn and the b4 rook by playing a3.  However this would have resulted in a cramped inflexible defence that would probably have given Black a lot of time to get more active and would have been vulnerable to a6 in particular.  White will lose a little more material but one pawn is hardly likely to make a difference now - it's activity White needs not minor material.
584,18,22,2Rb1b2,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1NnPp3/1RP5/4B3/qR2KPPP/8 b kq -',Qxb2 Rxb2 now would be favourable for White.
585,18,23,2Qa1,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1NnPp3/1RP5/4B3/1R2KPPP/q7 w kq -',Black has his eye on the kingside pawns but the cost is a temporarily useless queen who can't do anything else from the back rank.  We should note that Black has greatly limited activity - three of his pieces haven't moved one is in imminent danger and one the queen is a little out of the action.
586,18,24,2Nc7+,b'r3kb1r/ppN2ppp/3p4/2nPp3/1RP5/4B3/1R2KPPP/q7 b kq -',After a lot of time eyeing that square White finally moves to pick up the rook and is close to crippling Black's queenside.
587,18,25,Qh1,b'N4b1r/pp1k1ppp/3p4/2nPp3/1RP5/4B3/1R2KPPP/7q w - -',? Black has now moved to pick up the h-pawn but is in trouble since his queenside is both a near-wasteland and is under heavy attack.  Be7 is better - it picks up the knight and gets the h-rook out and fighting.
588,18,26,2Bxc5,b'N4b1r/pp1k1ppp/3p4/2BPp3/1RP5/8/1R2KPPP/7q b - -',White removes Black's last defender on the queenside.
589,18,27,2dxc5,b'N4b1r/pp1k1ppp/8/2pPp3/1RP5/8/1R2KPPP/7q w - -',Black's best choice - Be7 gets him mated and nothing else recovers the material.
590,18,28,2Rb4xb7+,b'N4b1r/pR1k1ppp/8/2pPp3/2P5/8/1R2KPPP/7q b - -',Black can escape this fight alive thanks to the time bought by White needing to capture the a7 pawn but will need to be a little careful.
591,18,29,2Kd6,b'N4b1r/pR3ppp/3k4/2pPp3/2P5/8/1R2KPPP/7q w - -',"Black's other options:
A: 24. ... Kc8 25. Rb8+ Kd7 26. R2b7+ Kd6 Rd8#
B: 24. ... Kd8 25. Rb8+ Ke7 and Black escapes the mate threat.
C: 24. ... Ke8 25. Nc7+ and Black again escapes.

Kd6 still allows Black to get out if he plays the right move (e4)."
592,18,30,2Rxa7,b'N4b1r/R4ppp/3k4/2pPp3/2P5/8/1R2KPPP/7q b - -',White now threatens mate in one to which Black must respond.
593,18,31,2Qxg2,b'N4b1r/R4ppp/3k4/2pPp3/2P5/8/1R2KPqP/8 w - -',But he does not.  It's odd that the computer overlooks a mate in one but syptomatic of its problems in the game overall - not enough activity and development.  Of course it's also a result of the low difficulty setting.

Clearly Black has no winning play here; he's just trying to hang on and survive.

My brave opponent decided to try out the Allgaier Gambit against me.  This involved sacrificing a piece to get Henry out into the open and then get at him.  Unfortunately for him Henry was able to run for cover and I was able to run away with my extra piece in the endgame.  My opponent thought this was too much and decided to wave the white flag.  So how did this happen?  Firstly I will provide the link that Gameknot Analysis has given to help you through this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17272114&fb=1&rnd=0.2644588537214342.  We start with a double KP opening 1.e4 and I respond with e5 and he gives me the KG with 2.f4 of which I accept."
729,23,1,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',2. f4 - King's Gambit.
730,23,2,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ..... exf4 - I accept.

733,23,5,Nxf7,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1N2/7p/8/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',6. Nxf7 - ..... Glenda and my KR are forked so in order too avoid losing a rook Henry must take the knight and face the big wide world.

I think he needs an extra cloak as well as those stockings so Glenda must still get those knitting needles going!

750,24,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I sacrificed a pawn to set some structural defects on black's pawns but he managed to remain dynamic enough and I was forced to regains the pawn... latter on the game I was able to get a small advantage by trapping black's remaining bishop but was ultimately unable to proceed to promotion without losing that advantage. Overall it was a nice dynamic draw against an higher rated opponent that was never able to exert any pressure... I choose not to publish this analysis yet because in this tournament my direct opponent has the chance of playing for 19.5 points maximum and I'm able to get only 19 points maximum for that I need a win against him playing black... my most direct opponent withdraw from this tournament so now he is playing for 175 points and I'm playing for 19 points (although I'm almost sure to lose one point so more realistically I'm playing for 18 points)

839,29,4,c6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp2p1/8/2BPP1b1/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Opens up channels for the queen and stops e5 due to e5 d5. This makes things more difficult for the knight on b8 but I'm going to have to expand on the queenside so maybe it'll be ok.
840,29,5,Bxf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp2p1/8/2BPP3/2N1Qb1P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',I decided to give up the bishop pair for a few reasons: There aren't many good squares for the light-squared bishop...Be6 Bxe6 fxe6 e5 looks awful for me. Bd7 blocks the knight and doesn't have a clear future and Bc8 would waste time and encourage f4 or g4 with an attack for white. Also afterBxf3 I can gain development time with b5. If Qxf3 then I have ideas with qb6 attacking d4. I think gxf3 should be considered for white opening the g file and looking to play f4 f5.
841,29,6,b5,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/1p6/2BPP3/2N2Q1P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - b6',Gaining space for development with tempo. I'm looking to attack the queenside before he can get things going on the kingside.
842,29,7,Bxd4,b'rn1q1rk1/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/1p6/3bP3/2NB1Q1P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Bd3 appears to be a mistake. It leaves d4 hanging and I don't think white can protect it tactically because things like Bxb5 lose to the intermediate move Bxc3 winning a piece. It may have been an oversight by white. I was expecting Bb3 keeping the bishop in the attacking and defensive position after which I would have played a5 either before or after qb6 attacking d4.
843,29,8,Bg7,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/1p6/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPP1BPP1/2KR3R w - -',Getting the bishop back to safety. I prefer this to e5 which cuts the bishop off from the kingside and potentially leaving a hole on the dark squares there. Qb6 was an option instead threatening f2 but I don't want to open up the game before I get my knight out. I have ideas of playing b4 then if na4 qa5 forcing b3 leaving the dark squares completely vulnerable.
844,29,9,b4,b'rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/1p2P1P1/2N2Q1P/PPP1BP2/2KR3R w - -',g4 was overly ambitious I think. White needs several moves to loosen up the kingside and b4 qa5 is a real threat. White might have looked at nxb5 cxb5 e5 opening an attack on the rook while black is undeveloped. I don't think it would work though as after nd7 exd6 rxd6 black can unpin and should be fine.
845,29,10,Qa5,b'rn3rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/q7/Np2P1P1/5Q1P/PPP1BP2/2KR3R w - -',Nb1 was probably better to meet qa5 with Bc4. Now the dark squares need desperate protection.

Now there are lots of threats including nb6 where nxb6 axb6 looks unstoppable and there'll still be an attack after kb1 nxa4 bxa4 qxa4. Very hard to defend now for white. 
847,29,12,Nb6,b'r4rk1/p3ppbp/1npp2p1/q7/Np2P1P1/1P3Q1P/P1P1BP2/1K1R3R w - -',If nxb6 axb6 opens the a-file with strong attack. If the knight doesn't move then nxa4 bxa4 qxa4 is coming. I'm threatening qe5 in a lot of lines.

851,30,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Back in my teenage/early 20's years I always played 1. e4. (Except when I was goofing around I would play 1. g4). Then I went through a long period in my life when I didn't play at all. A few years ago I started playing computer chess and found that my style has pretty much changed. So I'm bouncing back between 1. d4 1. b3 and 1. c4. So far my best success has been with 1. b3 actually.

michael60: you had better moves which would have helped you to beat me
michael60: And this move I haven't noticed and it's very good"
876,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My opponent (a much lower-graded player whom I hoped to beat easily considering the ECF grades given above) opens with the queen pawn. Grabbing a stake in the centre and opening up lines to develop the dark-squared bishop and later queen. Standard and theoretical stuff.
877,32,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',A very common reply. Black also grabs his share of the centre and makes it less attractive for White to play an immediate e2-e4 (which he would like to attempt at some point to take more control of the centre).
878,32,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',One of the most common openings in existence: the Queen's Gambit. White apparently sacrifices a pawn (in reality most experts do not consider this a pawn sacrifice because the pawn can easily be regained and theory offers no tried-and-tested way for Black to keep hold of the extra pawn). White's purpose in playing this move is to challenge Black's stake in the centre and build pressure against the d5-pawn.
879,32,3,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The reply which I always play against the Queen's Gambit - known simply as the Queen's Gambit Declined. A simple (yet highly theoretical) move aimed at keeping a pawn in the centre (e.g. after the unusual but playable 3.cxd5 exd5). The obvious drawback being that Black's light-squared bishop is blocked in.
880,32,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The usual move in the Queen's Gambit Declined: White develops a piece and increases the pressure against Black's pawn on d5. I have played this position many times from both sides of the board. An interesting alternative is 3.Nf3.
881,32,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',This opening for Black is called the Tarrasch. Black opts to occupy the centre with an unstable pawn structure in exchange for long-term fast development and good spatial control. Note that it is not possible for White to win a pawn immediately although it may initially appear so: in fact 4.cxd5 exd5 5.dxc5? is a well-known equalising line for Black after 5...d4! 6.Ne4 Bxc5! 7.Nxc5 Qa5+ with the fork regaining the minor piece.
882,32,6,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',? Clearly my opponent did not know how to meet the Tarrasch - this move is an opening error! This move simply loses a pawn for White as the following moves demonstrate:
883,32,7,Qxd4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? I think that this was a mistake on my part - and the computer (Fritz 10) corroborates this judgement. I played this move in the hope that White would allow a queen exchange which would help to consolidate Black's material advantage. However 5...cxd4 is better since it affords Black a space advantage and a firm grip on the centre as well as his material advantage. Black could then have followed up with ...Nc6 and ...e5 with a powerful grip on the central dark squares.
884,32,8,Qc2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqN3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',! Avoiding a queen exchange and placing the queen on a (slightly) more useful square.
885,32,9,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PqN3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Developing a piece and aimed at exchanging off White's strong central knight thus robbing White of a useful piece. Piece exchanges I decided would be useful in consolidating my small but significant material advantage. In fact this formed my strategy for the next few moves - so much so that I unfortunately sank into positional apathy and handed over the initiative to my opponent.
886,32,10,Bd3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PqN3/3B4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Developing a piece and preparing to replace the central knight with a well-placed central bishop if the former is exchanged off.
887,32,11,Nxe4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2Pqn3/3B4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Carrying out my strategy of exchanging pieces whenever possible.
888,32,12,Bxe4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqB3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',Despite being a pawn down White now has an excellent position - his light-squared bishop holds Black's queenside in a bind as well as putting pressure on Black's kingside. I therefore decided to force this bishop to move away as follows:
889,32,13,f5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/4p3/2p2p2/2PqB3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq f6',?! An odd-looking move leaving Black's e-pawn backward and weak. However I was determined to dislodge White's light-squared bishop from its excellent post in the centre!
890,32,14,Bf3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/4p3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',The most useful square for White to place his bishop retaining the unpleasant bind on Black's queenside. Black cannot play ...Bd7 because the b-pawn and then rook are hanging; Black also cannot play ...b6 because the pawn is pinned to the rook.
891,32,15,Bd6,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bp3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Developing a piece to a good square and preparing to castle.
892,32,16,1Ne2,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bp3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Developing a piece and forcing Black's queen to give up the useful post in the centre.
893,32,17,1O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',By now Fritz 10 rates the position as approximately equal. If we take into consideration the fact that White is a pawn down this means that the computer believes that White has enough compensation for the pawn. I agree with the computer - White's pieces are mostly developed to excellent logical squares (whereas Black's queenside is in a bind and undeveloped and Black's central pawns are weak).
894,32,18,1Nd7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Struggling to catch up with White in the development race. I was unwilling to play 11...Nc6 because of 12.Bxc6 bxc6 giving Black horrible doubled and isolated c-pawns to worry about.
895,32,19,1Rd1,b'r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1BR2K1 b kq -',Developing the rook to an excellent square from where it controls the open d-file. White also gains a tempo in playing this move since Black must do something about his undefended bishop on d6.
896,32,20,1Rb1,b'r1b1k2r/ppbn2pp/4pq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/1RBR2K1 b kq -',Preparing to expand on the queenside with b2-b4 after which White will enjoy a queenside space advantage and the power of his queenside rook will be increased.
897,32,21,1Ne5,b'r1b1k2r/ppb3pp/4pq2/2p1np2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/1RBR2K1 w kq -',My strategy was still to exchange as many pieces as possible! I felt that removing White's light-squared bishop from the board would be an achievement since this would allow Black to develop his queenside via ...Bd7 or ...b6 and ...Bb7.
898,32,22,O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppb3pp/4pq2/2p2p2/2P5/5Q2/PP2NPPP/1RBR2K1 w - -',Black's position seems to make more logical sense than it did a few moves ago with fewer undeveloped pieces hanging around. Also Black retains his extra pawn! However I still think White enjoys the better position and White's next move grabs the initiative:
899,32,23,Qh4,b'r1b2rk1/ppb3pp/4p3/2p2p2/1PP4q/5Q2/P3NPPP/1RBR2K1 w - -',Trying to retake the initiative with threats against the pawns on h2 and c4.
900,32,24,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/ppb3pp/4p3/2p2p2/1PP2B1q/5Q2/P3NPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',Neatly parrying both threats and making Black's dark-squared bishop less useful.
901,32,25,1Rxb4,b'r1b2rk1/pp4pp/4p3/5p2/1RP2N1q/5Q2/P4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',The most striking difference between these two positions is the activity of the rooks and minor pieces. White's rooks and knight are all dominating the board controlling a multitude of squares; by contrast Black's rooks and bishop are all huddled on the back rank controlling hardly any squares at all! I resolved to do something to sort this out immediately:
902,32,26,1Rb8,b'1rb2rk1/pp4pp/4p3/5p2/1RP2N1q/5Q2/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Trying to wriggle out of the bind which White's queen imposes on Black's queenside.
903,32,27,2c5,b'1rb2rk1/pp4pp/4p3/2P2p2/1R3N1q/5Q2/P4PPP/3R2K1 b - -',Taking advantage of Black's loss of time and increasing White's space advantage on the queenside.
904,32,28,2Qe7,b'1rb2rk1/pp2q1pp/4p3/2P2p2/1R3N2/5Q2/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',Pinning the c-pawn and thus preventing c5-c6 which could otherwise be an extremely annoying move for Black to face.
905,32,29,Bd7,b'1r3rk1/pp1bq1pp/4p3/2P2p2/2R2N2/5Q2/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - -',The bishop is starting to become more useful! Additionally this move clamps down on the c6-square preventing White's pawn from advancing any further.
906,32,30,2Re1,b'1r3rk1/pp1bq1pp/4p3/2P2p2/2R2N2/5Q2/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',White changes his plans - now he tries to put pressure on Black's backward weak e-pawn and tie down Black's bishop and queen to defending it.
907,32,31,2Bc6,b'1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/2b1p3/2P2p2/2R2N2/5Q2/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Moving the bishop away from defending the weak e-pawn but White cannot take advantage of this yet because his queen is under attack. Furthermore this moves Black's bishop to a very useful diagonal - pointing directly at White's kingside where it will play a very important role later on.
908,32,32,Rf6,b'1r4k1/pp2q1pp/2b1pr2/2P2p2/2R2N2/6Q1/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I'm not sure exactly what I was trying to achieve with this move other than simply defending the e-pawn.
909,32,33,Rbf8,b'5rk1/pp2q1pp/2b1pr2/2P2p1N/2R5/6Q1/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',??! I didn't really want to play 24...Rff8 returning the rook and allowing a repetition of moves. Therefore I impulsively (and stupidly?) allowed this exchange sacrifice (sacrifice of a rook for minor piece).
910,32,34,2Qb8+,b'1Q4k1/pp2q1pp/2b1pr2/2P2p2/2R5/8/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',A fork allowing White to pick up a pawn. However I think that this is a mistake since it leaves White's queen completely out of the game. Over the next few moves Black is able to create all the activity and set tactical problems for White largely because White's queen has become an irrelevance.
911,32,35,2Qxa7,b'8/Qp2qkpp/2b1pr2/2P2p2/2R5/8/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Black now has a material disadvantage so he is obliged to create activity in order to gain compensation. I achieved this by creating a series of threats as follows:
912,32,36,2Rg6,b'8/Qp2qkpp/2b1p1r1/2P2p2/2R5/8/P4PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Firstly a simple threat against White's kingside - namely targeting the g-pawn.
913,32,37,2g3,b'8/Qp2qkpp/2b1p1r1/2P2p2/2R5/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 b - -',Parrying the threat but weakening all the light squares on White's kingside.
914,32,38,2Qd7,b'8/Qp1q1kpp/2b1p1r1/2P2p2/2R5/6P1/P4P1P/4R1K1 w - -',! Aimed at exploiting the weak light squares on White's kingside. The threat is ...Qd5 followed by ...Qg2# or ...Qh1#. My opponent sank into thought at this point.
915,32,39,Qd2,b'8/Qp3kpp/2b1p1r1/2P2p2/8/2R3P1/P2q1P1P/4R1K1 w - -',If 29...Qd5 30.f3 seems to hold White's position together. Instead I tried to create trouble by attacking White's rooks.
916,32,40,3Rce3,b'8/Qp3kpp/2b1p1r1/2P2p2/8/4R1P1/P2q1P1P/4R1K1 b - -',If 30.Rcc1 30...Qd5! reintroduces Black's threats against White's kingside light squares.
917,32,41,3f4,b'8/Qp3kpp/2b1p1r1/2P5/5p2/4R1P1/P2q1P1P/4R1K1 w - -',! Preparing to break open White's kingside.
918,32,42,Rxg3+,b'8/Qp3kpp/2b1p3/2P1R3/8/6r1/P2q1P2/4R1K1 w - -',Not really a rook sacrifice since 33.fxg3?? Qg2#. White's kingside is broken open and I felt sure that checkmate should follow.
919,32,43,3Kf1,b'8/Qp3kpp/2b1p3/2P1R3/8/6r1/P2q1P2/4RK2 b - -',The only move: if 33.Kh2 Qxf2#.
920,32,44,3Bg2+,b'8/Qp3kpp/4p3/2P1R3/8/6r1/P2q1Pb1/4RK2 w - -',? At this point I missed a forced checkmate! 33...Qd3+! and checkmate follows in all lines e.g. 34.R5e2 Rg1+!! 35.Kxg1 Qg6+
921,32,45,Bh3+,b'8/Qp3kpp/4p3/2P1R3/8/6rb/P2q1P2/4R1K1 w - -',Observe the fact that Black's pieces for the first time are all playing active roles in the game - they are all playing a part in Black's overwhelming attack! By contrast White's queen is doing absolutely nothing on a7 and White's rooks aren't particularly useful either.
922,32,46,Qxf2,b'8/Qp3kpp/4p3/2P1R3/8/6rb/P4q2/4R2K w - -',I calculated that this led to a forced win as the text shows by exchanging off most of the pieces on the board into a winning rook-and-pawn endgame. Shame I didn't find the forced checkmate to crown my rather nice attack but such is life...an important skill in chess as well as in life is to know when to stop attacking exchange off all the pieces and convert the small advantage that you have gained in the attack.
923,32,47,Bg2+,b'8/1Q4pp/4pk2/2P5/8/6r1/P3Rqb1/4R2K w - -',! Forcing the exchange of all the pieces except one pair of rooks.
924,32,48,Rc8,b'2r5/2P3pp/4pk2/8/8/8/8/2R4K w - -',"The rest is easy: Black walks his king over to d7 picks up White's last remaining pawn and promotes one of his three pawns in an easily winning endgame.

Worst move would have been the disastrous 8..f6. Somewhere in between would've been sacrificing the Knight on f6 which at the end of the day probably led to the best position for Black all things considered.

White would have the strong advantage but at least Black would have a pulse. Instead....

947,34,12,2Kxf1,b'5r2/p1p3pk/1pn2p1p/8/3PP3/P5P1/1P3PBP/R4K2 b - -',I trade material but lose my d-pawn. However I have a B v N advantage which I will look to make use of in the endgame.  Also notice how all black's pawns are on dark squares. This is something I will have to change if I am to win
948,34,13,Rxc5,b'8/p5pk/1p3p1p/2r5/3nP3/P5P1/5PBP/2R2K2 w - -',?! was bxc5 better I like having the rook behind a passed pawn
949,34,14,2f4,b'8/p5pk/5p1p/2p5/3nPP2/P5P1/6BP/5K2 b - f3',I need to develop my king while avoiding a fork. Ke1? Nc2+! wins the a-pawn and the 2 passed pawn will be hard to stop. Even if the pawns are captured without losing the bishop. The knight should be the better minor piece with all pawns on 1 side.
950,34,15,3Bf1,b'8/p5k1/5ppp/2p5/3nPP2/P5P1/5K1P/5B2 b - -',Stopping the c-pawn advancing. Was Kg1 a mistake. Was 29...c4 better. I think so note how Ke3 fails to Nc2+ Kd2 Nxa3 Kc3. Although white gets the c-pawn the a-pawn will be more dangerous than the c was. Then black should be able to get his king in behind the white K-Side pawns. (Only quick analysis) So I will come back later and do some more this may be mistaken. I managed to lose my notes on this position so I don't know what else I saw.
951,34,16,3Bc4,b'8/6k1/5ppp/p1p5/2BnPP2/P5P1/5K1P/8 b - -',This stops the c-pawn from moving. However White's king is in a poor position so he needs to move the a-pawn to free the king. Also black maybe able to play a4 however I am not a fan because it places the pawn on a light square however this would free the c-pawn to be pushed. White will trade the bishop and have two pawns for his piece with one of them an outside passed pawn. Good thing with a4 is that it ties down the white king 
952,34,17,3a4,b'5k2/8/5ppp/p1p5/P1BnPP2/6P1/5K1P/8 b - -',White will allow his king to move this also controls b5 which become important later
953,34,18,3Nc6,b'5k2/8/2n2ppp/p1p5/P1B1PP2/6P1/5K1P/8 w - -',Is black looking to go to b4 and stop the white king from escaping???
954,34,19,Ke7,b'8/4k3/2n2ppp/p1p5/P1B1PP2/4K1P1/7P/8 w - -',I want my king on c4 so I spend the next few moves looking to kick the knight to get my king in there. However as it transpires my king is better on the K-Side
955,34,20,3e5,b'8/4k3/5ppp/pBp1P3/P2n1P2/4K1P1/7P/8 b - -',Trading allows White to move is king out. Also Look at how the LSB teases the knight. It frees the c and a-pawns however White will get a passed b-pawn which is more dangerous when combined with the e-pawn which is threatening exf6
956,34,21,3h3,b'8/4k3/6pp/pBp1Pp2/P2n1P2/4K1PP/8/8 b - -',Wanting to play g4
957,34,22,3g5,b'8/4k3/7p/pBp1Ppp1/P2n1P2/4K1PP/8/8 w - -',Black can't play Nxb5 because of axb5 when the b and e-pawns will be more dangerous. Nxb5? axb5 a4 b6 a3 b7 a2  b8=Q a1=Q any king moves invite e6 or e6+ when the b pawn queens. That line I gave is the best. Looking now I think that this is playable but the line black plays is better.
958,34,23,3h4,b'8/4k3/7p/pBp1Ppp1/P2n1P1P/4K1P1/8/8 b - -',I prefer this over g4 because I like to keep two pawns together.
959,34,24,3gxh4,b'8/4k3/7p/pBp1Pp2/P2n1P1p/4K1P1/8/8 w - -',g4 may have been better although the black pawns get on the light squares. But White will struggle to make use of this while the black king stop the white bishop from getting in behind enemy lines.
960,34,25,h5,b'8/4k3/8/pBp1Pp1p/P2n1P1P/4K3/8/8 w - -',No king can break through the same would have happened is the black king moved some where after h5.

962,34,27,3Kd7,b'8/3k4/8/p1p1Pp1p/P1Bn1P1P/4K3/8/8 w - -',? This loses. Now this is what my opponent said to me in chat: Too funny I was sleep walking and gave you an unearned pawn. This is the funniest reason I have ever heard for someone losing a game
963,34,28,c4,b'8/3k4/4n3/p3Pp1B/P1p2P1P/4K3/8/8 w - -',Black tries to get some counterplay but this is really a nothing move I think Ng7 was better
964,34,29,4Kd4,b'8/3k2n1/6B1/p3Pp2/P1pK1P1P/8/8/8 b - -',now white should have an easy win
965,34,30,4e6,b'8/8/2k1P3/p4B2/P1K2n1P/8/8/8 b - -',! A great end to a good ending.
966,34,31,4e7,b'8/4P3/2k5/p4B1n/P1K4P/8/8/8 b - -',Black resigns after Nf6 Bg6 Kd7 e8=q+ Nxe8 Bxe8 Kxe8 Kb5 and white wins the a pawn and has two outside passed pawns which black can't stop. Thanks for the game 2hopeful. All comments welcome. I am wondering should this ending be drawn?
967,35,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Offering to go into Danish lines that would probably transpose into Goring or Scotch Gambits after 2...ed 3.Nf3  a white move order favored by a United States Champion GM Frank Marshall.
968,35,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black declines to take my d pawn which could now push to d5 with the trap line of 3.d5 Nd4? 4.c3 and Black would lose that knight even if he makes his best try now of 4...Qh4. White can defend his e pawn and pick off the N later tho he must use some care in doing so to not fall into any tactical error himself in the process. 
969,35,2,Kxd8,b'r1bk1bnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',White has taken away Blacks Castling rights now which is the only slight advantage he can claim. And it may come to nothing since the position is not a very volatile one and King safety is not a strong factor. Since the pawns are even where facing each others on both wings that tends to make a drawish ending as well. 
970,35,3,fxe6,b'r2k1bnr/ppp3pp/4p3/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Now White can claim some advantage from the doubled pawns of Black. The trouble being the doubling only hurts black from any winning chances since his pawns on the King side now have little chance of making any advantage there from creation of a passed pawn which is highly unlikely. But this does not help WT since defensively the K-side BL pawns are still functional. 
971,35,4,Be3,b'r2k1bnr/ppp3pp/4p3/4p3/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',To keep BL from Bc5 where it would be most active. 
972,35,5,Bc5,b'r6r/2k3p1/1pp1pn1p/p1b1p3/2P1P3/PP2BP2/6PP/RN1R2K1 w - -',WT can trade Bishops here. But then the prior remarks about the K-side pawns would not apply to those on the Q-side as well. And WT would have a pawn on b3 to defend from BL attacking it with his open file and potentially would end up having to tie his pieces to that task. Which makes no headway toward winning. But overall this is a very drawish looking game irregardless. 
973,35,6,1Kxe3,b'r6r/2k3p1/1pp1pn1p/p3p3/2P1P3/PP2KP2/6PP/RN1R4 b - -',The king becomes more centralized now for the endgame. 
974,35,7,2Nxd1,b'8/2k5/1pp1pn1p/p3p1p1/2P1P3/PP2KPPP/8/3N4 b - -',Knight endings are inherently drawish in theory but inherently not drawn in practice for they seem to bring out the error potential of any player who does not understand their nature fully or who tends to play a bit too quickly. Indeed it is my ending of choice to enter when possible if I am seeking to score against any fast moving players. 
975,35,8,2Kf2,b'8/2k5/1pp1p2p/p3p1pn/2P1P3/PP3PPP/5K2/3N4 b - -',A concession WT must give up his King centralization which hinders any f4 push. But that is little lost since getting f4 pushed only continues to be a drawish position where BL would be rid of his doubled pawns. 
976,35,9,2Ne3,b'8/8/1ppkp2p/p3p1pn/2P1P3/PP2NPPP/5K2/8 b - -',The WT Knight is looking to post on g4 and BL needs to move his own Knight now to avoid losing his h pawn. 
977,35,10,2Ng4,b'8/8/1pp1p2p/p1k1p1pn/2P1P1N1/PP3PPP/5K2/8 b - -',Black needs to play the logical follow-up of a4 now having commited his King to action on the Q-side when he moved it there. In fact BL may be considered to be winning after either response to a4 by WT those being bxa4 or b4+. But it is a blitz game and a N ending. 
978,35,11,b5,b'8/8/2p1pn2/ppk1p1N1/2P1P3/PP3PPP/5K2/8 w - -',Again to mention that playing 28. a4 is correct to make a passed pawn and provide King infiltration. 
979,35,12,3Nxe6+,b'8/8/4Nn2/ppk1p3/4P3/PP3PPP/5K2/8 b - -',This is the problem with BL's choice on move 28. He would have liked to be able to play a4 now giving him infiltration but is not given that chance.
980,35,13,3h4,b'8/2kn1N2/8/pp2p3/4P2P/PP3PP1/5K2/8 b - -',Pushing the h-pawn because besides being the most distant from the BL King it is a point of theory in Knight endings that Rook pawns will be the hardest for a Knight to stop from advancing toward promotion. 
981,35,14,4Kf4,b'5n2/8/2N4P/8/2k1PK2/5PP1/8/8 b - -',The N must be attacked and forced to move since it aides the e4 pawn to keep out the BL King letting WT's King stroll on into the action now himself. 
982,35,15,4Ne5,b'5n2/8/7P/2k1N3/4PK2/5PP1/8/8 b - -',Ne7 allowing the N a choice of posting at d5 or f5 is certainly worthy of consideration here. 
983,35,16,4g4,b'5n2/8/3k3P/4N3/4PKP1/5P2/8/8 b - -',A mistake. Having played Ne5 WT should continue his theme of blockading BL K from the action by playing Kf5 now. 
984,35,17,4Ke7,b'5n2/4k3/7P/4N3/4PKP1/5P2/8/8 w - -',Ke6 would have given WT some problems to straighten out. And he can but it takes many more moves and a repositioning of his own N. 
985,35,18,Kg8,b'6k1/7n/6PP/4NK2/4P3/5P2/8/8 w - -',50.Nd7 ! Nf8 51.Nxf8 Kxf8 52.Kf6 Queens the most rapidly
986,35,19,Kh5,b'8/8/5KN1/7k/4P3/5P2/8/8 w - -',Notice here the blockading action the N provides with help from his K. WT would like to be able to keep the BL monarch at bay until a Queen provides the denouement if possible.
