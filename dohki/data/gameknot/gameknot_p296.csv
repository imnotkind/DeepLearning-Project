0,0,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Vienna game at first glance this appears to be less aggresive than the more standard Nf3 but the point is that white has not given up the option of f4. black must play actively so as to not to end up in a bad line of the kings gambit.
1,0,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',this leads to a quiet game after 4.d3 a more exciting game occurs after 3...Nxe4 4.Nxe4 d5
2,0,2,f4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq f3',? i don't know to much about the vienna game but this just didn't seem right to me 4.d3 is the mainline here
3,0,3,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1nP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',now f4 seems like a wasted tempo
4,0,4,Qe2,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2B1NP2/8/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',as good a way as any to keep the material balance.
5,0,5,dxc4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2p1NP2/8/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',much better than capturing the knight black gains development and the bishop pair for free
6,0,6,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/2Q1NP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',gaining tempo on the exposed white queen
7,0,7,Qc3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/4NP2/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',? allowing black yet another tempo Qf1 and Qe2 seem to be better and more natural than this
8,0,8,Qd3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/1b2NP2/3Q4/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',?? now whites position is terrible black has an endgame with a development advantage some lovely doubled isolated pawns to aim at and an extra pawn to boot. Now black just has to convert these advantages to the full point
9,0,9,Be7,b'r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/4Np2/P2P4/1P1P2PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',take a look at the position black has every advantage he could hope for and then some. his bishop pair rule the open board white's doubled isolated pawns sit at the end of a half open file and black even has an extra pawn. if that wasn't enough whites dark square bishop is going to struggle to escape it's prison on c1along with the rook on a1.
10,0,10,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/4Np2/P2P1N2/1P1P2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',getting the rook on the open file and keeping the king fairly near the centre as he may be needed at the frontline in the near future
11,0,11,1Nf2,b'2kr3r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/5p2/P2P1N2/1P1P1NPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',defending the horribly weak d pawns. 
12,0,12,1g5,b'2kr3r/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N2/1P1P1NPP/R1B1K2R w KQ g6',blacks pieces are nicely positioned so black starts to push his kingside pawn majority toward its goal. as a result white will be discouraged from castling kingside so the white king will likely remain in the centre where it will be easily attacked
13,0,13,1h3,b'2kr3r/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',else the kingside pawns will crash through with g4 and g3

15,0,15,1O-O,b'2krr3/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',white decides the pawnstorm will be easier to weather than the discovered check
16,0,16,1f5,b'2krr3/ppp1b2p/2n1b3/5pp1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B2RK1 w - f6',in stark contarst to whites d pawns the doubled black f pawns are of great atacking value and will be used to great effect to open the white kings position. This prefectly illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of doubled pawns here the white pawns are completely immobile and so are very weak as they need to be defended with pieces therefore the white position is very passive. Blacks doubled pawns on the other hand are very mobile and are under no pressure from the white pieces and so can be used as a battering ram to smash open the white position
17,0,17,1Re1,b'2krr3/ppp1b2p/2n1b3/5pp1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1R1K1 b - -',attempting to get some counter play by contesting the e file but maybe white should start by trying to develop the queenside

23,0,23,2Nh2,b'2krr3/ppp1b2p/2n1b3/8/P3Npp1/3P4/1P1P2PN/R1B1R1K1 b - -',the only square

25,0,25,Bf5,b'2krr3/ppp5/2n5/2b2b1p/P4pp1/2NP4/1P1P2PN/R1B1R2K w - -',threatening the rook white can't even exchange here as after 23.Rxe8 Rxe8 white can't defend the back rank
26,0,26,2Ne4,b'2krr3/ppp5/2n5/2b2b1p/P3Npp1/3P4/1P1P2PN/R1B1R2K b - -',? i think moving the rook was stronger this just steps into a powerful pin
27,0,27,2Kb8,b'1k1rr3/ppp5/2n5/2b2b1p/P3Npp1/3P4/1P1P2PN/R1B1R2K w - -',again black need not act on the pin now as white needs at least 2 moves to defend the rook. trying to exploit the pin straight away with 23...Rxd3 is infact bad here as white simply replys 24.Nd6  winning the exchange
28,0,28,2b3,b'1k1rr3/ppp5/2n5/2b2b1p/P3Npp1/1P1P4/3P2PN/R1B1R2K b - -',24.b4 is a better try but that to loses to 24...Bf2! (not 24...Nxb4 25.Ba3!) 25.Re2 Bd4 26.Rb2 Bg7 27.Bb2 (27.Ba3 Rxd3) 27...Bxb2 28.Rxb2 Rxd3

30,0,30,2Bb2,b'1k2r3/ppp5/2n5/2b2b1p/P3Npp1/1P1r4/1B1P2PN/R3R2K b - -',finally white manages to develop the c1 bishop but its already to late.
31,0,31,Bb6,b'1k2r3/ppp5/1bn5/7p/P3bpp1/1P1r4/1B1P2PN/2R1R2K w - -',the bishop is monsterous on that diagonal
32,0,32,2Nf1,b'1k2r3/ppp5/1bn5/7p/P3bpp1/1P1r4/1B1P2P1/2R1RN1K b - -',?? steps into forced mate but then there aren't exactly many alternatives. Re2 seems best defending the g2 square and preparing to double rooks but i very much doubt that it would affect the final result. notice that moving the c1 rook off the back rank to c4 also allows forced mate after 27...Bxg2 !
33,0,33,Bxe2#,b'1k2r3/ppp5/1b6/7p/P4p2/1P3npr/1B2b1PN/2R2K2 w - -',
34,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I begin the game with a typical opening e4. At that moment I was getting ready to play the Italian game but black destroyed my plans.
35,1,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sycilian defence! c5 begins the opening and black is ment to gt ready to attack on the queen side.
36,1,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A most often played move for black's second move after c5. Black is going to play the dragon version of the syclian.
37,1,3,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',d4 is a strong move to play in that position. White(me) fights for the centre and usually forces black to exchange.
38,1,4,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black exchanges
39,1,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',g6 gets the bishop ready to concere the two centre squares e5 and d4.
40,1,6,Nxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2N3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Since I'm not so strong in that opening I wanted to avoid any problems. Safest way is to exchange the knights.
41,1,7,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black takes the knight with the b pawn to help fight for the centre
42,1,8,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I played c3 to avoid any problems when the black bishop moved to g7. Then the b2 square would be on attack and had to be deffended at all times to later avoid losing the rook.
43,1,9,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',As said before
44,1,10,Bd3,b'r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Played the bishop to defend the pon before the knight on b1 was activated.
45,1,11,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Prepares black for a later possibility of e5 and opens the line for the bishop.
46,1,12,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',You are propobly thinking why did I play the bishop on e3 and not on f4? If I played Bf4 black would play d5 and I would have to move i t back anyway. Also I am planing in advance to play f4 and attack alittle bit on the kingside.
47,1,13,1Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This one of my favourite position when I am playing white. I really likemwhen I have the bishop on d3 and the queen on c2. That way I have some attack on the far pon on h7.
48,1,14,1Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Completely do not understand that move but when I come to think about it  I know it had something to do with opening the line for the bishop.
49,1,15,1f4,b'r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/2pp2p1/8/4PP2/2PBB3/PPQN2PP/R3K2R b KQ f3',Maybe I came a bit to late with that move but I want to place my knight behing the pon and move forward.
50,1,16,1e6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBB3/PPQN2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',"A good and defensive move. Now I have little chance with attacking with only the pons and bishops. I need to get ""reinforcements""."
51,1,17,1g3,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBB1P1/PPQN3P/R3K2R b KQ -',Hold the entire structure together.
52,1,18,1Nf3,b'r2q1rk1/pb1n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBBNP1/PPQ4P/R3K2R b KQ -',As planned.
53,1,19,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/2pppnp1/8/4PP2/2PBBNP1/PPQ4P/R3K2R w KQ -',Useless move. Just couple of moves ago black moved it from that place for no reason and now he is coming back there.
54,1,20,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/2pppnp1/4P3/5P2/2PBBNP1/PPQ4P/R3K2R b KQ -',Now I had enough attack to push the pon forward

58,1,24,1Nxe3,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/2p1p1p1/4P3/8/2PBnNP1/PP2Q2P/R3K2R w KQ -',My opponent didn't take the e5 pon because it would be the same equal exchange. 16...Nxe5  17. Nxe5  Bxe5 18. Bxa7. Maybe next he would take the c3 with a check and still keep the won pon but he would have almost no pieces around his king to defend.
59,1,25,1Qxe3,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/2p1p1p1/4P3/8/2PBQNP1/PP5P/R3K2R b KQ -',I take the knight

92,2,2,d4,b'r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',White transposes immediately to an Open Sicilian in which however the exchange of light-squared bishops is considered to favour black especially in the Dragon. Accordingly I head for the Dragon.

Note however that this would open up a lot of space around the White's King position and waste a lot of time. 
The Black Bishop on h4 is currently immobilized so I felt like trading it for 2 pawns would be more of a concession because the Black King is sitting ducks in the center of the board - mate is in the air should go for the king before Black can reorganize his remaining forces to cover him up... g4 is a perfectly good move too but I wanted to go for the King...I'm already up a piece and 3 pawns - satisfying the hunger for material can often provide your opponent with time to build up a counter-plan."

White maintained the pins to the point at which it was no longer possible. The pins by Black were refuted and several threats to pin the pawns on f2 and g2 have been avoided by White. The blunder by Black on move 13 was also the result of White escaping the pin on the f3 Knight with 12 Qb3. The irritating pins on the Black knights have successfully limited Black's movements on the other hand it seemed that Black did not anticipate the so very basic pins on the knights to be as harmful as Black made no decent attempts to deal with the pins without allowing White to compromise Black's position.

190,5,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',3..d5 would have entered the Gruenfeld defence.
191,5,4,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',The King's Indian defence is a very tricky opening wich can lead to some nice chances for black when handled improperly by white. This is often based on the strength of the bishop along the diagonal.
192,5,5,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',It's not easy for white to find the right defence against black's setup mostly because this opening has so many variations wich can only be compared to the Sicilian defence.

Regarding the note at move 22: if black had played 22...Qc8 then after 23.Bxe5 Bxe5! 24.Nxg6 ? hxg6 25.Qxg6 the position is uncertain. I tried analysing some lines but the postion is full of pitfalls. Here is one line I liked: after 25.Qxg6 
25...Rf8 26.Kf1! Rxf2 ? 27.Kxf2 Bd4 28.Ke2 Bxe3 29.Kxe3

226,6,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/4pnp1/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Continues development again I would play c4 and plan perhaps to set up an assault on the queenside.
227,6,3,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A second move for the bishop against opening principles although it moves the bishop to a more natural square and frees whites position.
228,6,4,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',White is now set up to push the e-pawn to get the pawn centre black could have prevented this with a pre-emptive d5. However one of the tactics of the kings indian defence is to encourage white to over expand then counter-attack the over stretched pieces. For this reason black castles to safety and can now think about developing the queenside.
229,6,5,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ e3',Grabs the pawn centre
230,6,6,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Doesn't assult the centre yet black decides to bide his time and let white over commit. This move releases the bishop to d7 however I feel b6 to fianchetto the bishop to b7 or c6 to support the d-pawn in an advance to d5 would have been better. Nothing wrong with the played move though.
231,6,7,h6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3ppnpp/6B1/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Played to unbreak the pin on the knight. White can either retreat or capture the knight. My instinct would be to retreat as I value the bishop over the knight and I see no precise tactic to win material or position by taking the knight. Also I feel black has weakened his king by playing the move and the pawn structure in front of the black king is already weak from the early fianchetto white could take advantage of this by keeping the bishop attacking the now weak h-pawn.
232,6,8,Bxf6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3ppBpp/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',But white captures the knight possibly he considers himself to be more developed than black so can start thinking of a kingside assault however losing the black square bishop isn't a good way to start this kind of attack.
233,6,9,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2p2/3p1bpp/4p3/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black finally attacks the centre and releases his white squared bishop however he has to be careful as generally the more developed player benefits from open lines.
234,6,10,1d5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',However he needn't worry as white chooses to close the centre. This choice would be more logical if white had a pawn standing on c4 to protect the d-pawn however as he doesn't the overextended pawn may become a weakness
235,6,11,1Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black now looks to take advantage of the overstretched white centre by threatening to move his knight into c5 a strong outpost for the knight and if not then the knight is well positioned to swing over to the kingside to support an attack or defend.
236,6,12,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Attacks the weak h6 pawn

1) Whites centre pawns are overextended and c6 would be problematic
2) The pawn structure in front of both kings is weak however black is stronger as he has more pieces to defend it and no obvious way in. White however has a major white square weakness and will need to be careful
3) Whites bishop is blocked in and has little mobility blacks c8 bishop looks far more active and can easily move to attack the white position"

243,6,19,Nf6,b'r4rk1/pp1q1pb1/2pp1npp/3Pp3/4P2P/2N3P1/PPPQBP2/R4RK1 w - -',Moving the knight to a good position to oversee any battle for the centre with the pawns. Also with whites exposed kingside black won't want his knight being traded off for the bishop as less material reduces the chance of a successful attack.
244,6,20,1f4,b'r4rk1/pp1q1pb1/2pp1npp/3Pp3/4PP1P/2N3P1/PPPQB3/R4RK1 b - f3',White continues to expand on the kingside. This is a move i would hardly even consider with such an open king white would be better to plan an escape route with possibly 18.

266,7,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This response is very flexible for white avoiding the closed sicilian (2. Nc3) and the grand prix attack (2. f4)

If black had played d6 by now white could play f3 setting up the yugoslav variation of the sicilian which has very interesting chances for both sides.  I *like* the yugoslav as white but black hasn't played d6 yet.  The pawn serves an additional purpose by being on f2; more on this in the note to move 12.

My analysis tells me that if black and I both castle (him short myself long) and he plays d5 the game will continue roughly as a standard yugoslav with 9. 0-0-0 instead of 9. Bc4 (and without f3).  I do note however that I could have played Bc4 here instead of Qd2 preventing black from playing d5 directly."

274,7,9,1Nxe7+,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2Np1p/6p1/3n4/8/2b1B3/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',!  Black cannot recapture with the knight or he loses a rook and a king move loses a full minor piece.  Black must play Qxe7.
275,7,10,1Qxd5,b'r1b2rk1/pp2qp1p/6p1/3Q4/8/2b1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - -',And now white is up a pawn.  Note how useful it is for white to have NOT played f3 as the pawn on f2 protects the Be3.  (I had to calculate this back on move 7 -- something I couldn't have done were this not correspondence chess!)

279,7,14,Be5,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/3Rb1p1/4b3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/2K2B1R w - -',Hitting the rook and forcing it into a more passive position.  Black is down a pawn but his bishops are in command of the board.  Compare the activity of the black bishops to the passivity of the white ones.  (And keep an eye out for a reversal of fortunes.)
280,7,15,1Rd2,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/4b1p1/4b3/8/4B3/PPPR1PPP/2K2B1R b - -',! The best square for the rook.  It allows the Bf1 to develop and gives the Rh1 full freedom along the back rank.  The one care is that the dark squared bishop must guard against a move like Bf4.
281,7,16,1Bxa2,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/6p1/4b3/8/4B3/bPPR1PPP/2K2B1R w - -',"?? Back before Bobby Brown was known for beating his wife doing drugs and singing the monster mash with Mike Tyson he had a song that went

""Kiss her miss her love her... that girl is poi-i-son""  

That pawn on a2 looked poisonous to me that I didn't really consider black would take it.  On the other hand with so few pieces left on the board can it really be bad to take a pawn?  I had expected Ra-c8 and that was part of the reason I played Rd2 on my last.  But now I had to think.  My game note to myself was ""does 16. b3 trap the bishop?""  I spent a couple of days thinking about it and then played..."
282,7,17,1f4,b'r4rk1/pp3p1p/6p1/4b3/5P2/4B3/bPPR2PP/2K2B1R b - f3',!?  I like this move as an in-between move.  It drives the black bishop back to either f6 g7 or h8 as any other move simply allows white to play 17. b3 18. Kb2 and the bishop falls without a fight.  Also it allows the Be3 to move freely without having to worry about the rook getting pinned to the king.
283,7,18,1Bg7,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/8/5P2/4B3/bPPR2PP/2K2B1R w - -',Hard to argue with that choice as it preserves the possibility of a pin on the Rd2 if white blunders.
284,7,19,1b3,b'r4rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/8/5P2/1P2B3/b1PR2PP/2K2B1R b - -',!  Alright.  Time to prove that this bishop made a mistake on the 15th!
285,7,20,1Rac8,b'2r2rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/8/5P2/1P2B3/b1PR2PP/2K2B1R w - -',Threatening Bxb3 where the bishop is immune due to the pin along the c-file.  White would love to play Kb2 but that pesky bishop on g7 prevents it.
286,7,21,1Bc4,b'2r2rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/8/2B2P2/1P2B3/b1PR2PP/2K4R b - -',!  A good continuation.  Now Bxb3 is impossible.  How will black respond?
287,7,22,1a5,b'2r2rk1/1p3pbp/6p1/p7/2B2P2/1P2B3/b1PR2PP/2K4R w - a6',"?  Too slow I think.  Perhaps best for black was to play b5 immediately or even to play Rxc4 giving up the exchange for a pawn and the bishop pair (and chances).  One mistake doesn't usually lose the game but two can be decisive.

Now white has the means to win the bishop."
288,7,23,1Bd4,b'2r2rk1/1p3pbp/6p1/p7/2BB1P2/1P6/b1PR2PP/2K4R b - -',!  Blocking the dark-squared bishop's path to the b2 square and allowing the king to get in there.  Note the contrast between the positional power of the white bishops after this move vs. after black's 14th.
289,7,24,1b5,b'2r2rk1/5pbp/6p1/pp6/2BB1P2/1P6/b1PR2PP/2K4R w - b6',This is definitely too slow now.  Black needed to try Rxc4 and try his luck in an inferior endgame.
290,7,25,2Bxg7,b'2r2rk1/5pBp/6p1/pp6/2B2P2/1P6/b1PR2PP/2K4R b - -',!  The black bishop on a2 is lost now.  Black must recapture with the king or white simply has an overwhelming advantage.
291,7,26,2Bd5,b'2r2r2/5pkp/6p1/pp1B4/5P2/1P6/b1PR2PP/2K4R b - -',!  Much better than Bxb5 where black escapes with equality.  The Ba2 is completely trapped.

In 1619 Greco started keeping a notebook of tactics and games and he took up the custom of giving copies of his manuscripts to his wealthy patrons. In 1621 Greco took off to test himself against the rest of Europe visiting Paris and later London. He spent the last years of his life at King Philipp IV's court and died in the West Indies seemingly from a disease that he contracted there around 1634.  This is one of his exciting games that includes a queen sacrifice. The moral of this chess game is dont be materialistic.

This obviously prepares to fianchetto the light squared bishop. This move is still however popular against the English(1.c4) where it is far more effective. An early fianchetto by Black shows a willingness to defend against a big pawn center picking away at it from the wings. In ceding so much territory Black must be on constant guard against direct attacks on the King as this game illustrates :)

314,9,6,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White starts a rapid piece development  to take further advantage of black's uncoordinated and underdeveloped pieces.
315,9,7,c6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',A key component in this version of the Scandi. Black must create an escape path for his queen. Black is pinning his hopes on strong flank attacks once white dominates the center of the board.
316,9,8,Qf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq -',? An over-zealous attempt for a quick mate on f7. Better was Nf3 e3 or even e4.

Notice that it has now moved twice while no pawn stab at the middle or developing move for the dark squared bishop has been made yet. White is allowing black the opportunity to catch up in development.

I was debating whether or not to just resign this nightmare at this point as a strong player such as gibonacci should have no problems converting a rook advantage to a win.

346,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',1. e4 gains space and opens lines for the king bishop and the queen.  The  strategic drawback is that d4 and f4 have been slightly weakened. Since pawns can never move backwards the e-pawn can never help control those squares.  The e-pawn may itself become an object of attack.

This is a horrible blunder that caused Black to resign once I exploited it. Although Ne5 seems fine because it puts pressure on my pinned piece Black didn't look ahead to see if I have any tactics.

You should always do a safety check before moving (especially in positions with a lot of hanging pieces) to make sure your opponent doesn't have any tactics."

Thanks to tactics I will get my queen back for free and end up with an extra piece. Black resigned once he realized his costly mistake.

695,22,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',The theme here is development.  So far we have played 6 games and 50% of them have been decided by developmental problems.  This game is no exception.  I manage to get some very active piece play and once White steps out of theory I am able to simplify the position to one in which Black has a winning engame.
696,22,1,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My friend chooses this move order to avoid my well studied Bogo-Catalan lines with an early ...Bb4 .

702,22,7,a4,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/8/P1pP4/5NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - a3',This is by far the most interesting move as White wants to interfere with Black's plan of queenside expansion and with it his queenside development.  White does have to be careful as it is a weakening move and he hopes that his center control will offset the weakenss of b4 and b3.  As often is the theme in the Catalan Black's chances will most likely be tied to the activation of his queen's bishop.
703,22,8,Bd7,b'rn1q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3pn2/8/P1pP4/5NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',The best method of developing the light-squared bishop to oppose its opposite number.

706,22,11,Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1n1p3/3nN3/P1QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',This keeps the position as complicated as possible without any spatial or positional concessions.

708,22,13,1Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3p3/P2nn3/2QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Here I opt to exchange the centralized knight and effectively nullify White's pawn advantage in the center.  Now simplification would yield a won endgame for Black due to the queenside majority.

If you would take out the opening of just trying to trap a checkmate for easy win and put in some development I think he would have won.

It immediately rips up the center and is a ""surprise"" move to a lot of players who play 1. e4. This opening leads white into a few very tough decisions right from the start but is actually more defensive in nature than it appears at this stage (at least the variation that I prefer)."
970,34,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White is offered an appetizer and correctly munches it down.

972,34,3,Qf3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! A rather dubious refutation. As I have played the Scandanavian against manhattan numerous times I'm fairly sure he wants to get me out of my comfort zone. By offering up this queen exchange white intends to recapture with tempo by playing 4. NxQ. As I am fairly familiar with manhattan's style of play I choose to accept his offer. Having lost many more games to him than I have won I have come to realize that his opening play is stronger than mine and by getting into the middlegame as soon as possible I hope to even the odds a bit.
973,34,4,a6,b'rnb1kbnr/1pp1pppp/p7/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',"?! R.I.P. ""book"". Black declines the chance to maintain equality in development and opts for a very defensive play. By restricting white's light squared bishop black hopes to dig in a fight a defensive battle. Not aggressive at all I know but with the queens off the board I felt it was just as important to decide where I wanted HIS pieces not just mine."
974,34,5,d4,b'rnb1kbnr/1pp1pppp/p7/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq d3',White correctly begins to punish blacks passive play by staking a claim in the center.
975,34,6,b5,b'rnb1kbnr/2p1pppp/p7/1p6/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq b6',?! Yet another extremely dubious move! Black again neglects his own development and further restricts whites light squared bishop. Black has every intention of getting his own light squared bishop to b7 to dominate the all important long diagonal.
976,34,7,a3,b'rnb1kbnr/2p1pppp/p7/1p6/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',? I'm sure if manhattan were annotating this game he would have already given me a few well deserved question marks so I don't feel too bad about questioning this move. White should have gone ahead and extended his lead in development by playing any one of numerous moves. I expected Bf4. By playing 6. a3 I can only assume that he wanted to restrict my dark squared bishop. As he already has a 4-3 pawn advantage on the queenside I consider this a waste of time.

At first glance it appears to be a least worth consideration as it locks down the dark squares on the queenside after white plays b4. This would give white a pretty strong pawn structure. It's hidden weakness however is that it restricts the Nb1. After what I consider to a mistaken 13th move this weakness will be punished severely.

I got lucky but it is interesting to see that this typically closed slow ponderous opening can be played very aggressively provided white gives you an opening.  He opens with the common e4 to which I often respond with what is perceived be a weak reply d6.
1070,36,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',d4 is also common at this point.  Nf6 is a common reply for this opening setting up pressure on the e4 pawn.
1071,36,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',At this point e5 is common setting up a series of early maneuvers that can weaken the castle.  But in this case white responds with Nc3 a defensive move.

As my own dark squared bishop is somewhat threatened by an aggressive (yet risky) play of g5 I opt to oblige him. In doing so black is faced with the decision of re-taking with his queen or c pawn and either way his resulting position will be somewhat unbalanced.

If he takes then I develop my light squared bishop with some aggressive tempo. If he doesn't take I can play c5 (which locks the pawns up and gives me a space advantage on the queenside).

1145,39,15,Nc3,b'rnb1k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A developing move which hits his destination square of e4.
1146,39,16,Nbd7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I can see him wanting to get developed but this move even further restricts his light squared bishop. Maybe he intends to play b6? I think 0-0 may have been a stronger play.
1147,39,17,1Bd3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Another developing move which hits e4. Now I envision 0-0 for myself with the plan of starting an attack. Where? I have no idea but I will have a strong lead in development which I can use aggressively.
1148,39,18,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black secures his king and obviously wants to start raising Cain on the kingside.
1149,39,19,1b4,b'r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ b3',? I guess I just wanted to secure my domination of the queenside. 0-0 was probably a better play though.
1150,39,20,1a6,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1p1pn2/2Pp1p2/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black is apparently more concerned with my potential queenside domination than he is with his own development. The weakness of his light squared bishop is now foremost in my mind.
1151,39,21,1a4,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1p1pn2/2Pp1p2/PP1P4/2NBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',a5 is where this guy needs to be! If I can TOTALLY lock down the queenside then I can play 0-0-0 to secure my own king and have counterplay against his kingside attack which I can just feel is coming.
1152,39,22,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1p1p3/2Pp1p2/PP1Pn3/2NBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black decides it's time to post that knight. I have two options to take it if I like but as it is not really threatening anything I can't handle I feel that it is better to just protect my Nc6 with Qc2 (which hits e4 again) and will allow 0-0-0 as I mentioned.
1153,39,23,Qf6,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n2pp/p1p1pq2/2Pp1p2/PP1Pn3/2NBPN2/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Man his light squared bishop (and by extension his Ra8) sure are weak!
1154,39,24,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n2pp/p1p1pq2/2Pp1p2/PP1Pn3/2NBP3/2QN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I figure a fourth hit on e4 can't be all bad and playing f4 if he allows it will be strong.
1155,39,25,1g5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1pq2/2Pp1pp1/PP1Pn3/2NBP3/2QN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ g6',Here comes the attack. While my intended f4 is now not feasible I see an even better option. Kick out his Ne4 and I can have a lot of ammo pointed towards his king.
1156,39,26,Nxc3,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1pq2/2Pp1pp1/PP1P4/2nBPP2/2QN2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Practically forced.
1157,39,27,Qg6,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1p1q1/2Pp1pp1/PP1P4/2QBPP2/3N2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',While it is obvious this move was intended to create a square for his knight to move to it also creates a pin of his f pawn against his queen.
1158,39,28,1e4,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1p1q1/2Pp1pp1/PP1PP3/2QB1P2/3N2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',! Threatening e5! and also pressuring the pin I just mentioned. The risk however is that my kingside can be weakened. I really want to play 0-0-0 SOON!
1159,39,29,1fxe4,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1p1q1/2Pp2p1/PP1Pp3/2QB1P2/3N2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',He bites.....
1160,39,30,Qh5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1p3/2Pp2pq/PP1PP3/2QB4/3N2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Escaping the pin and preventing my 0-0-0 but it allows.............
1161,39,31,1e5,b'r1b2rk1/1p1n3p/p1p1p3/2PpP1pq/PP1P4/2QB4/3N2PP/R3K2R b KQ -',! Black's problem child his light squared bishop is all but worthless. It will take forever to develop it to a useful square now.
1162,39,32,1Rf7,b'r1b3k1/1p1n1r1p/p1p1p3/2PpP1pq/PP1P4/2QB4/3N2PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Again trying to find a place for his knight.
1163,39,33,2Be2,b'r1b3k1/1p1n1r1p/p1p1p3/2PpP1pq/PP1P4/2Q5/3NB1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Time to prepare for 0-0-0 while throwing in a nice little queen attack as well.
1164,39,34,2Qh6,b'r1b3k1/1p1n1r1p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P4/2Q5/3NB1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Escaping the attack of the bishop but walking into...........
1165,39,35,2Qe3,b'r1b3k1/1p1n1r1p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P4/4Q3/3NB1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Another ugly pin that he must deal with.
1166,39,36,2Nf8,b'r1b2nk1/1p3r1p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P4/4Q3/3NB1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black now hopes to get his knight into play via g6.
1167,39,37,2Nf3,b'r1b2nk1/1p3r1p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P4/4QN2/4B1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',Threatening to win the g pawn after Qxg QxQ NxQ.
1168,39,38,2Rf4,b'r1b2nk1/1p5p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P1r2/4QN2/4B1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',! Black finds an interesting interposition. If he can play Re4 he may have some serious threats.
1169,39,39,2g3,b'r1b2nk1/1p5p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P1r2/4QNP1/4B2P/R3K2R b KQ -',I took a while on this move. I realized after much thought that I had no real fear of him playing Re4 as it could be easily sidestepped.
1170,39,40,2Qd2,b'r1b2nk1/1p5p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1Pr3/5NP1/3QB2P/R3K2R b KQ -',Notice that the pin is still effective.
1171,39,41,2Rg4,b'r1b2nk1/1p5p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P2r1/5NP1/3QB2P/R3K2R w KQ -',"A seemingly strong move which protects his weakened ""isolated"" pawn."
1172,39,42,2O-O-O,b'r1b2nk1/1p5p/p1p1p2q/2PpP1p1/PP1P2r1/5NP1/3QB2P/2KR3R b - -',Finally! Now I have some resources to get moving on the kingside.
1173,39,43,2Qg7,b'r1b2nk1/1p4qp/p1p1p3/2PpP1p1/PP1P2r1/5NP1/3QB2P/2KR3R w - -',"Solving the problem of the ""isolated"" pawn."
1174,39,44,2Rdg1,b'r1b2nk1/1p4qp/p1p1p3/2PpP1p1/PP1P2r1/5NP1/3QB2P/2K3RR b - -',! Realizing a 5-3 piece advantage on the kingside I prepare to launch an overwhelming attack. Notice that this was the correct rook to place on g1 as the other will be need on the h file.
1175,39,45,2h6,b'r1b2nk1/1p4q1/p1p1p2p/2PpP1p1/PP1P2r1/5NP1/3QB2P/2K3RR w - -',? This just weakens black's position. Better was Ng6.
1176,39,46,2h4,b'r1b2nk1/1p4q1/p1p1p2p/2PpP1p1/PP1P2rP/5NP1/3QB3/2K3RR b - h3',!! take a minute and look at the capturing possibilities in this position should he play gxh.
1177,39,47,2Ng6,b'r1b3k1/1p4q1/p1p1p1np/2PpP1p1/PP1P2rP/5NP1/3QB3/2K3RR w - -',Too little too late. No matter what white will come out on top after the carnage of the next few moves.
1178,39,48,3Qxg5,b'r1b3k1/1p4q1/p1p1p1n1/2PpP1Q1/PP1P4/6P1/4B3/2K3RR b - -',Black is now seriously on the ropes.
1179,39,49,3Ne7,b'r1b3k1/1p2n1q1/p1p1p3/2PpP1Q1/PP1P4/6P1/4B3/2K3RR w - -',Following general theory white starts eliminating pieces while he has the advantage.
1180,39,50,3g4,b'r1b5/1p2n1k1/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/4B3/2K3RR b - -',! Preventing Nf5 which could cause serious headaches for white.
1181,39,51,3Bd7,b'r7/1p1bn1k1/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/4B3/2K3RR w - -',32 moves into the game and black finally moves his light squared bishop. Notice that it still isn't doing much however. Black must get his Ra8 into the mix if he is to have any chance of achieving at least a draw.
1182,39,52,3Bd3,b'r7/1p1bn1k1/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/3B4/8/2K3RR b - -',Still somewhat concerned about blacks knight white begs him to move to g6.
1183,39,53,3Ng6,b'r7/1p1b2k1/p1p1p1n1/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/3B4/8/2K3RR w - -',Thank you!
1184,39,54,3Rgf1,b'r7/1p1b4/p1p1p1k1/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K2R1R b - -',This move achieves almost total control of the areas around the enemy king.
1185,39,55,3Rg8,b'6r1/1p1b4/p1p1p1k1/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K2R1R w - -',I guess black wanted to try to get to my g pawn eventually but he has no time to do so.
1186,39,56,Kg7,b'6r1/1p1b2k1/p1p1pR2/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K4R w - -',Kg5 may have bought a little more time. Now it is just a matter of technique.
1187,39,57,Bc8,b'2b3r1/1p4k1/p1p1pR2/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K2R2 w - -',Black is overly concerned with the protection of his e pawn. Be8 was better.
1188,39,58,3Rf6f7+,b'2b3r1/1p3Rk1/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K2R2 b - -',The check is just gravy - my goal is to get the black king away from f8.
1189,39,59,4Rf1f7+,b'2b2Rr1/1p3Rk1/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K5 b - -',While I can't mate him right this instant I can win the bishop.
1190,39,60,4Rc7,b'2b3k1/1pR5/p1p1p3/2PpP3/PP1P2P1/8/8/2K5 b - -',And a dagger through the heart of the problem bishop. Fitting as it caused so many problems for black this game. I feel this game shows how a singular weakness on the part of your opponent can be repeatedly attacked and reinforced in such a way that strong mating attacks will eventually come to life. I hope you have enjoyed:) - Thomas
