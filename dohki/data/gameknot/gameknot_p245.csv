5,0,5,Bd8,b'rn1bk2r/1p1q1ppp/p2p4/2pNp3/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',A good position for his bishop to be ... for a long time this bishop would prove to be a key factor keeping my knight at d5.

7,0,7,1b3,b'rn1bk2r/3q1ppp/p2p4/1ppNp3/2P1P3/PP1P1N2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',b3 instead of b4 because I did not wish to break my pawn structure in the center and because if the exchange took place my rook was in a better position to control the b file.

9,0,9,1Nd2,b'r2b1rk1/3q1ppp/p1np4/1ppNp3/2P1P3/PP1P4/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I think my intention was to push f4 to force the e pawn off and control the f file using my rook.
10,0,10,Nd4,b'r2b1rk1/3q1pp1/p2p3p/1ppNp3/2PnPP2/PP1P4/3N2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This was what I was afraid of when I moved my knight from f3. While my queen currently prevents that knight (in the same way his bishop is placed) from causing any trouble I do not want the queen to be inactive because of that.

14,0,14,cxd4,b'r2b1rk1/3q2p1/p4p1p/1p1Np3/2PpP3/PP1P4/6PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',probably superior to exd4 as it does not expose his king-side to a possible pass-pawn.
15,0,15,1c5,b'r2b1rk1/3q2p1/p4p1p/1pPNp3/3pP3/PP1P4/6PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I had to remove the danger of bxc4 as that gives him sufficient tempo to bring his rook to control the c file.
16,0,16,2b4,b'2rb1rk1/3q2p1/p4p1p/1pPNp3/1P1pP3/P2P4/6PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',that seals up the queen-side for a while. a5 simply buys me a tempo for it is far to my advantage for me to move axb4 than bxa5. Now my attention (and worries) have to be directed at the f file. f5 followed by fxe4 would sink my knight.
17,0,17,2Qf3,b'2rb1rk1/3q2p1/p6p/1pPNpp2/1P1pP3/P2P1Q2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',My only reasonable defense I believe. 21. ... fxe4  22. Qxe4 exposes his weaker rook to my stronger doubled rook. At the same time my knight is kept alive by the queen but just barely. I believe my plan was to do Nb6 for the bishop-knight exchange if it looked like he could pressure my queen. 22. Qxe4 Rf4 would force a rook exchange that probably gives me a stronger positional advantage.
18,0,18,2f4,b'2rb1rk1/3q2p1/p6p/1pPNp3/1P1pPp2/P2P1Q2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',This was troubling. 22. ... Rf5 could mean penetration of my defenses.

20,0,20,2Qe6,b'2rb1rk1/6p1/p3q2p/1pPNp2Q/1P1pPp2/P2P4/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',Notice my queen is almost trapped.

22,0,22,2Raf1,b'3b1rk1/6p1/p1r1q2p/1pPNp2Q/1P1pPp2/P2P1R2/6PP/5RK1 b - -',Still oblivious to the danger my queen was in.
23,0,23,2Bg5,b'5rk1/6p1/p1r1q2p/1pPNp1bQ/1P1pPp2/P2P1R2/6PP/5RK1 w - -',This move woke me up. 24 ... g6 loses me the game. My original plan of 24. g3 to force an advantages pawn exchange would have trapped my queen beyond rescue. For now the queen is safe if my g pawn stayed where it was but I had very little room for error and very few options if I kept the g pawn in place.
24,0,24,2g4,b'5rk1/6p1/p1r1q2p/1pPNp1bQ/1P1pPpP1/P2P1R2/7P/5RK1 b - g3',Which led to this. The plan was to pull the queen to the safety of h3 in response to g6 and then back-off to g2 so I could push h3 to shore up my defenses. This of course leaves me vulnerable to h5 which could lead to an exchange where I have a rather weak pawn on the g file.
25,0,25,2Rh3,b'5r2/6pk/p1r1q2p/1pPNp1bQ/1P1pPpP1/P2P3R/7P/5RK1 b - -',moving his king gave me an opportunity for an attack. Qxg5 wins a free bishop if he does nothing about it.
26,0,26,2Kg2,b'5r2/6pk/p1r3qp/1pPNp1bQ/1P1pPpP1/P2P3R/6KP/5R2 b - -',This was starting to get uncomfortably dangerous.
27,0,27,2Rxh5,b'5r2/6pk/p1r4p/1pPNp1bR/1P1pPpP1/P2P4/6KP/5R2 b - -',The queen exchange might have been a blunder on his part. Made things somewhat safer for me. The h rook is still in the same danger of g6 though which wins him a tempo since i would have to withdraw.
28,0,28,2Rcc8,b'2r2r2/6pk/p6p/1pPNp1bR/1P1pPpP1/P2P4/6KP/5R2 w - -',not sure I understood the intent of this move.
29,0,29,2Kf3,b'2r2r2/6pk/p6p/1pPNp1bR/1P1pPpP1/P2P1K2/7P/5R2 b - -',I prefered Kf3 instead of Rf3 because I sensed that if he did Ra8 I could respond with Ra1 in order to support the a pawn in the event of a5 ... axb4 ... Nxb4 (axb4 would be a terrible move on my part).
30,0,30,Bd8,b'2rb1r2/7k/p5pp/1pPNp3/1P1pPpP1/P2P1K1R/7P/5R2 w - -',Back to the annoying position for his bishop.
31,0,31,3Ke2,b'2rb1r2/7k/p5pp/1pPNp3/1P1pPpP1/P2P3R/4K2P/5R2 b - -',This is to allow Rhf3 continuing to block the pawn while freeing both my h rook and the h pawn.
32,0,32,Ra8,b'r2b1r2/7k/p6p/1pPNp1p1/1P1pPpP1/P2P1R2/4K2P/5R2 w - -',He takes advantage of my rush to clear my congested position to pursue an attack on the a file.

34,0,34,3Rf7,b'r2b4/5r1k/p1P4p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/P2P1R2/4K2P/5R2 w - -',He recognizes the need to prevent my pawn from going further.
35,0,35,Rc8,b'2rb4/5r1k/p1P4p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/P2P1R2/4K2P/2R5 w - -',At this point I noticed how I can tie 3 of his pieces up using just 2 of my pieces. If I could move my other rook into play that c pawn would be devastating.
36,0,36,3Rf2,b'2rb4/5r1k/p1P4p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/P2P4/4KR1P/2R5 b - -',Rf1 would take too long. Rf2 followed by Kf3 is the desired shortcut that simultaneously allows my king to physically block his f pawn.
37,0,37,3axb4,b'2rb4/5r1k/2P4p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/5R1P/2R5 b - -',After I made the exchange thinking it was safe I realized a sequence which could have caused me potentially serious problems in my rear - 37. axb4 Ra7 38. Rfc2 Ra3.
38,0,38,3Be7,b'2r5/4br1k/2P4p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/5R1P/2R5 w - -',Possibly his first blunder. Nxe7 would not be good for me but this move simply gives me the extra time for Rfc2 (which was what I intended in the first place). At the same time the bishop now blocks his f rook from doing anything useful in that constricted position.
39,0,39,Bd6,b'2r5/5r1k/2Pb3p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/2R4P/2R5 w - -',Not sure this move buys him much other than freeing the 7th rank for his rook.
40,0,40,3c7,b'2r5/2P2r1k/3b3p/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/2R4P/2R5 b - -',The goal is to allow Rc6. In this cramped position dominated by my knight he has few means of preventing the rook from penetrating his defenses. My goal was to get rid of his extremely weak and indefensible b pawn. Of course because his bishop will be forced away from d6 by this move my c pawn remains secure even after I move the rook off the file to attack his b pawn.
41,0,41,3Kg6,b'2r5/2P2r2/3b2kp/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/2R4P/2R5 w - -',His 2nd and most critical blunder i believe. He just walked his king into a position where his bishop would be pinned by my rook (where I wanted to go in the first place).
42,0,42,Rd7,b'2r5/2Pr4/2Rb2kp/1p1Np1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/7P/2R5 w - -',His only option of holding everything together. Unfortunately it opens his rooks up for a fork by the knight.
43,0,43,Rdxc7,b'2r5/2r5/1NRb2kp/1p2p1p1/1P1pPpP1/3P1K2/7P/2R5 w - -',I believe this is his final blunder.  41. Nb6 Rcxc7 would have been a far better move. It would still have resulted in pretty much a lost position though.

45,1,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',An English played in the first round of the most recent GK tournament. Black nets an exchange but White manages to cook up some dangerous positions while down in material until the advantage proves too much. 
46,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',If you're ever going to play me and want to piss me off play the English. Positional play is the hardest for me I much prefer sharp tactical lines which are harder to find in this opening if your opponent doesn't want you to. That being said I believe that I have a winning record against the English...

50,1,5,dxc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2p5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move gives 33%/33%/32% in the world for White/Black/Draw. White wanted to play the English but so far I've managed to steer the game in a direction I like open with more tactics at play than positional moves.
51,1,6,Na3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2p5/N4NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',A weak square for a knight...

I believe his next intended move is O-O-O which brings his rook against my extremely weak d pawn where any further pressure whether through c5 or Nb5 would cause it to buckle and making further problems for my queen which is currently its only defender and because of the future position of the rook also ""safe"" because of the rook. I believe my only reasonable move now is Qa5 followed by Rd1. Subsequently I can add defense to the d pawn by Nb4 if necessary (not necessarily wise as it stands now)."

Rxd5 looked somewhat problematic but my plan was for Qxa2 and work my way back from there. 14. cxd5 opens up the c file for an eventual attack on the king (after my knight scrams out of the way). 14. exd5 helps clear the way for my e pawn which when pushed opens a diagonal of control for my black bishop to attack his weak b pawn.
82,2,5,Ne7,b'r1br2k1/1p2npbp/p2p2p1/q2Pp3/2P5/4BQ1P/PP2NPP1/2KR1B1R w - -',I think I wanted more mobility with this move. Nb4 kinda blocks up the queen for no strong reasons.

At this point the rook at h1 is doomed and there's not a whole lot white can do about it. Some responses are better than others though.

131,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Hi everyone!  Here is another game where I have had oodles of luck!  In this game my opponent has me well under the cosh until he blundered the exchange.  At the time of this blunder my rating was 1698 and his was in the 1770's.  I only needed a draw to get my rating to 1700 so I offered him one and he declined - this turned out to be yet another stroke of luck as I was able to stave off his attack and in the endgame the extra material proved decisive and so instead of 2 points I gain 8.8 points putting my rating back into the 1740s!  The action unfolds with a Queen's Pawn Opening.

Would a pawn exchange on e4 have been preferable here?  If so there would have been the possibility of Glenda and Frere Lenoir lining up on the b8-h2 diagonal putting pressure on the h 2 square and leaving the possibility of a knight move to g4 to add still more pressure.  But this doesn't happen and a series of exchanges will leave me in Old Matey's shadow on the h file.

The Wicked Witch of the West is threatening mate on h7.  Glenda could be driven off this square at any time though so quick action is needed.  We are still in the Gameknot 1900  database btw and the line is favourable to white.  However there is a game involving a guy called Bramster who played his bishop to d8 attacking the g5 knight and the game ended in a draw so I decided to go down that route.

Glenda moves to c2 staying on that vital diagonal.  Thankfully it will take a couple of moves before Glenda must move again and I will have time to exchange Frere Lenoir for that knight on g5.

I am dreading an incursion of the Wicked Witch of the West to c7 but this does not happen.  She moves back to the h file instead and now I have a rook lift from white onto f3 preparing to swing onto h3 to worry about.  But as you will see Frere Leblanc will take care of all that!

I take the rook and here I offer my opponent a draw as explained in my introductory note.  He thinks he still has a strong attack so he declines.  However I manage to deal with it and he must surely regret this refusal.

I have carefully calculated that he has enough time to get to g4 to protect my f3 rook and force white to give up his dsb.  Otherwise he will have Glenda to contend with!

I  didn't have an internet connection at home and had been sending and receiving my moves from computers at the public library.  I had been analyzing 31 Rad1 instead of Rdd1.

218,9,9,3Kf2,b'8/1p4pp/1p1k4/3n1p2/3P4/P7/1P3K1P/4R3 b - -',I would have played 37 Re8.
219,9,10,3Re5,b'8/1p5p/1p1k4/3nRpp1/3P4/P7/1P3K1P/8 b - -',Again I would have played 38 Re8.
220,9,11,3Ne7,b'8/1p2n2p/1p1k4/4Rpp1/3P4/P7/1P3K1P/8 w - -',Besides guarding the f-pawn the knight blocks the White rook from e8.  I had made my fortress and waited to see how White would try to breach it.  I think White has a win here but it's not easy to make progress.
221,9,12,4h4,b'8/1p2n3/1p1k3p/4Rpp1/3P3P/P5K1/1P6/8 b - h3',Generally White should avoid exchanging pawns.  I thought maybe White was trying to open the h-file for his rook but he never made an attempt to transfer his rook to the h-file.  
222,9,13,4b4,b'8/1p1kn3/1p6/4Rpp1/1P1P4/P5K1/8/8 b - b3',It looks like White might make progress by playing d5 and answering ...Kd6 with Re6 ck.
223,9,14,Kd7,b'8/1p1kn3/1p6/4Rpp1/PP1P4/6K1/8/8 w - -',Again White could try the 44 d5 Kd6 45 Re6 ck idea.
224,9,15,4Rb5,b'8/1p1kn3/1p6/1R3pp1/PP1P4/6K1/8/8 b - -',This doesn't seem like a very good place for a rook which is a long range piece and doesn't want to get in a knife fight.
225,9,16,4a5,b'8/1p2n3/1p1k4/P3Rpp1/1P1P4/6K1/8/8 b - -',I think the position may be drawn after this.  After the exchange on a5 any attempt by the rook to penetrate Black's position may result in all his pawns disappearing.
226,9,17,Nd5,b'8/1p6/3k4/R2n1pp1/1P1P4/6K1/8/8 w - -',I felt very comfortable now and felt I could hold the draw with some chances at winning.
227,9,18,4Rb5,b'8/1p6/3k4/1R1n1pp1/1P1P4/6K1/8/8 b - -',?? clearly a blunder.  The White rook steps into an open cage.
228,9,19,4b6,b'8/8/1p1k4/1R1n1pp1/1P1P4/6K1/8/8 w - -',And the door to cage snaps shut.

230,10,0,Bd6,b'rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Here black wasn't paying attention and white pulled off a tactic that messed up his position.
231,10,1,1Qxc4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/5p2/2QP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Now white has both center pawns and black only has one on the side.
232,10,2,1d5,b'r1r3k1/pp3ppp/2npq3/3P1p2/2Q1n3/1P2PN2/PB3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Whoops.  Black should have paid closer attention.
233,10,3,Rxc4,b'r7/pp3kpp/3p4/5p2/2r1n3/4PN2/PB3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"At this point black thought ""Well I'm a pawn down but at least I do have one advantage: I have a rook on the open column.""  Then white proceeds to liquidate half the material in trades."
234,10,4,2Bxc1,b'8/pp3kpp/3p4/5p2/4n3/4PN2/P4PPP/2B3K1 b - -',At this point black very nearly resigned.  It's so depressing to play a knight against a knight and a bishop.  Then he noticed a fancy fork against white's bishop and king to win a pawn.
235,10,5,2Nc3,b'8/pp3kpp/3p4/5p2/8/2n1PN2/P4PPP/2B3K1 w - -',Of course if white doesn't move the bishop black can fork it on the next move (N-e1).
236,10,6,2Bxd6,b'8/pp3kpp/3B4/5p2/8/4PN2/n4PPP/6K1 b - -',Well ok.  So white managed to get his pawn back. BUT! NOW there are two beautiful isolated pawns on the edge of the board. In the worst case white can probably sacrifice a knight or a bishop and get both of them but who knows maybe black can work it into some other kind of advantage.
237,10,7,b4,b'8/p4kpp/3B4/5p2/1p1N4/4P3/n4PPP/6K1 w - -',And the pawn is off.
238,10,8,Kc2,b'8/6pp/p7/5p2/1p1B4/4P3/n1kN1PPP/4K3 w - -',"Wow this is going really well (for black).  By chasing white's pieces around black was able to get his king to the other side of the board before white did.  White may still be able to trade a piece for both pawns if he tries hard.
Incidentally black could have defended the pawn on g7 but it seemed more valuable to get the king to c2 (and keep white's king out) than to save the pawn on g7."
239,10,9,Kd3,b'8/6pp/p7/2B2p2/8/NpnkP3/5PPP/4K3 w - -',Check is not always the best thing.  Black's king is actually better positioned now  so if white DOES manage to sneak his king in and get both pawns black can quickly get his king to the other side of the board and start capturing pawns.  Playing back and forth between the left and right is an important part of the endgame.
240,10,10,3Bd4,b'8/6pp/p7/5p2/3B4/NpnkP3/5PPP/4K3 b - -',This time black is willing to take a move to save the pawn.
241,10,11,b2,b'8/7p/p5p1/5p2/8/N1k1P3/1p2KPPP/8 w - -',Now it is getting more desperate for white.  He may not be able to trade the knight for both pawns he may have to trade it for a single pawn.
242,10,12,4Nb1,b'8/7p/6p1/p4p2/8/1k2PP2/1p2K1PP/1N6 b - -',At this point black (who was me) counted it would take him 4 (unanswered) moves to get a queen and if he tried for a queen by P-e4 e5 e6......it would take 5 (unanswered) moves.  Otherwise black would have been forced to move my king back to d5 to protect against the white pawn getting a queen.  It's an advantage to have your pawns closer to the other side of the board!!(unless the other king is close enough to capture them)
243,10,13,a3,b'8/7p/6p1/5p2/4P3/p4P2/1pkNK1PP/8 w - -',Black ignores the offer of the pawn.  There will be plenty of time to get all the pawns when black has a queen.
244,10,14,4Nc4,b'8/7p/6p1/5p2/2N1P3/p4P2/1pk1K1PP/8 b - -',One final attempt at a tactic if P-b1 then Nxa3 forking the king and (new) queen.
245,10,15,4a2,b'8/7p/6p1/5p2/2N1P3/5P2/ppk1K1PP/8 w - -',And resignation.
246,11,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Hi everyone just for once it is me that gets those pawns rolling!  This game against my buddy Bob Jacobs a player less than 100 points south of my rating is very even until well into the late middlegame when a pile up on the c file of my heavies leads to me winning a pawn due to a pin on his dark square bishop.  After that I still end up with work to do.  One big dilemma that I was faced with was ""Should Glenda abandon the c file to the Wicked Witch of the West and if so where should she go?""  Thankfully that dilemma was somehow sorted with Glenda able to go back to that file.  A queen swap followed and I had a strong wall of passers.  It seemed plain sailing but I ask when is a jstevens1 victory plain sailing?  Not often.  In the end a knight move enabled me to put the advanced queenside pawns just where I wanted them.  Even him giving up his dsb would not have prevented a joyous reunion between Glenda and Henry so he waved the white flag.

He kicks off with the Caro-Kann Defense and I respond with the exchange variation hoping for open play."

I didn't think that my e5 knight would be able to remain on that square for that much longer so I decided to trade it in.  At least the knight exchange leaves Bob with a queenside isolani which will weigh against him later on.
251,11,5,1Be5,b'r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1p1pn2/3pB3/3P4/2P5/PP1NQPPP/R4RK1 b - -',13. Be5 - Frere Lenoir takes the horse's place though.
252,11,6,1Nf3,b'r2q1rk1/3nbppp/p3p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NB1/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',15. Nf3 - opens up the possibility of putting another knight on that e5 square but the priority is to bolster that d4 pawn.

He now advances to a5 and this becomes an unfortunate choice of square for that poor little black pawn.

Thankfully this does not present too much of a problem but there is going to be some shuffling around of my heavies.  In the middlegame I am often faced with ""Where do I go from here?""  Well that c file just needs to have a white rook on it before black gets the chance to bag it first.  Glenda supports the c1-c3 squares as well as the d4 pawn so that makes it ideal for a doubling even trippling on that file.  Note that if the a8 rook moves off the a file the black pawn on a5 is up for grabs."

Black starts a pawn roll of his own and both Henry and his steed must work together to contain them as well as protect that vital pawn wall on the queenside.
266,11,20,Bb8,b'1b6/6p1/2Pk3p/PP2pp2/3p4/1N4P1/4KP1P/8 w - -',47. .......... Bb8 - that bishop will be cut off soon.

But he also provides two other vital roles.  Firstly he defends my c pawn.  Secondly he prepares b6 which will entomb that dark squared bishop.  Even if the black king were to move then at least Henry would not have to dodge a check from the dsb before I had a chance to entomb him.  He decides to back up the f pawn with his g pawn.  Now comes the coup de grace.
268,11,22,5a7,b'1b6/P7/1PPk2p1/5p1p/3Np3/2Kp2P1/5P1P/8 b - -',54. a7 - and with this move black waves the white flag as he will in two moves be down a whole queen and Glenda will clean up those black pawns with consumate ease before netting the black king.  An interesting endgame battle because in the final position just look at that impressive black pawn chain of Bob's!  He just got pipped at the post.  Hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now.

After the trials and tribulations of Beafyness' tourney it is nice to report that I beat someone in just 13 moves.  The Dentist is back after a sabbatical in Vietnam.  This game goes a long way to exorcise the memory of what happened the last time I was black against him (see The Dentist has his day).  He starts off with the Patzer's Opening an opening you should underestimate at your peril as an Expert played this against me and won.

Even with the queens off white was punished for slow development.  All his queenside pieces are at home where black is fully developed.  My battle with passivity continues.  What I am now trying to do is study what moves are thematic to what opening in particular pawn moves so that I do not get squeezed.  Just hope I have some more good news to post here.  Have a nice day everyone!  - Joanne

376,16,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I always choose the symmetrical variation of the English as I know it well and the Botvinnik setup is not as effective.

527,23,7,d4,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nnpbp/2p1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/1P3N2/PBP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq d3',White throws a spanner in the works shoring up his e-pawn with another pawn. I could almost see my position recoiling before my eyes from the constricting advance of the d-pawn.
528,23,8,c5,b'r1bqk2r/pp1nnpbp/4p1p1/2ppP3/3P4/1P3N2/PBP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',So I unveil the time-honoured way of undermining the d-pawn in the main line French Defence.

530,23,10,1Nd2,b'r1b1k2r/pp2npbp/4p1p1/q1npP3/8/NP6/PBPNBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now the knight is pinned. Black can play 11...Nd7 to place incredible pressure on the e5-pawn...
531,23,11,1Ne4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2npbp/4p1p1/q2pP3/4n3/NP6/PBPNBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',...or put more pressure on the pinned knight on d2 - a strategy with a lower probability of success but one which will reap greater rewards if it does succeed - namely the d2-knight.
532,23,12,Qc3,b'r1b1k2r/p4p1p/2p1p1pb/3pP3/4n3/NPq5/P1PNQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Black is trying to stretch White's defences and overwork his pieces. Notice that attention has completely shifted from the e5-pawn to the d2-knight!
533,23,13,Ba6,b'r3k2r/5p1p/b1p1p1pb/p2pP3/4n3/NPq2P2/P1PNQ1PP/1RB1K2R w Kkq -',Complicating the position adding more attack lines...all part of the effort to over-stretch White's defences. As White's king is defending the d2-knight the king is as bound to the knight as the knight is bound to the king! And if the king is stuck in the centre Black has an advantage.
534,23,14,Nxd2,b'r3k2r/5p1p/b1p1p1pb/p2pP3/8/NPq2P2/P1Pn2PP/1RBQK2R w Kkq -',I judged that it was time to begin exchanging on d2.

537,23,17,exf5,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/2p3p1/p2pPp2/8/qPP2P2/P2Q3P/R3K2R w K -',And now White is behind by a pawn.
538,23,18,2O-O,b'1r3rk1/5p1p/2p3p1/p2pPp2/8/qPP2P2/P2Q3P/R4RK1 b - -',It appears to me that White's exposed kingside can offer White's king no more protection than the centre can: at best this was a waste of a move.
539,23,19,3Rfe1,b'1r2r3/5pkp/2p3p1/p1qpPp2/8/1PP2P2/P2Q2KP/2R1R3 b - -',That's the way I like my opponent's rooks to be: tied down to their pawns.
540,23,20,3Qe7,b'1r2r3/4qpkp/2p3p1/p2pPp2/8/1PP2P2/P2Q2KP/2R1R3 w - -',Suddenly attention shifts. Now the pressure starts piling up against - you've guessed it - the e5-pawn. The e5-pawn is under multiple attacks for the second time in the game.

542,23,22,3Rce2,b'4r3/4rpk1/2p1q1pp/p2pPp2/5Q1P/1PP2P1K/P3R3/4R3 b - -',Ouch the pressure there really is crippling. A judicious attack from the side say with ...f6 should make the e5-pawn fall in the near future...I hoped... . But even should this fail White's rooks are tied down nicely which may allow me to attack in some other areas...
543,23,23,3Kh7,b'4r3/4rp1k/2p1q1pp/p2pPp2/5Q1P/1PP2P1K/P3R3/4R3 w - -',Clearing the way for 36...f6 as 35...f6 36.exf6  is check and throws a spanner in Black's works.
544,23,24,Qxf6,b'4r3/4r2k/2p2qpp/p2p1p2/7P/1PP2PQK/P3R3/4R3 w - -',If the queen was on e8 and the rooks on e7 and e6 Black's battery could win White's rook. As it is Black must content himself with recapturing the pawn. After having played f6 I realised that I would lose queen for rook thanks to the irritating f6-pawn unless I took it with my queen.
545,23,25,4Qxe1,b'8/7k/2p2qpp/p2p1p2/5P1P/1PP4K/P7/4Q3 b - -',Mass exchanges and all four rooks disappear.
546,23,26,Qxg5,b'8/7k/2p5/p2p1pq1/8/1PP4K/P7/4Q3 w - -',Black has a passed pawn. I had high hopes for turning this into a queen but this was by no means easy as queen-and-pawn endings like this one are much more unstable and unpredictable than rook-and-pawn endgames.
547,23,27,4Kxh4,b'8/7k/2p5/p2p1p2/7K/1PP5/P7/8 b - -',White has allowed the queens to be exchanged off which seems to be playing into my hands as I have an extra passed pawn.
548,23,28,Kg5,b'8/8/2p5/p2p1pk1/8/1PP3K1/P7/8 w - -',Using the opposition between the two kings I am pushing my opponent's king back. This should be an easy promotion.
549,23,29,4a4,b'8/8/2p5/p2p2k1/P4p2/1PP2K2/8/8 b - a3',I had overlooked that. 48.b4 could cause a few problems for Black.
550,23,30,cxb4,b'8/8/8/3p2k1/Pp3p2/5K2/8/8 w - -',Excellent! A pawn race! Who will promote first...?
551,23,31,5a8=Q,b'Q7/8/8/3p2k1/5p2/5K2/8/1q6 b - -',Back to a queen-and-pawn endgame...but now Black is ahead by TWO passed pawns.
552,23,32,5Qg2+,b'8/8/8/8/3p1pk1/3q4/5KQ1/8 b - -',Aha! A costly error by White!
553,23,33,5Qg3+,b'8/8/8/8/3p1pk1/6q1/5KQ1/8 w - -',White resigned. He cannot avoid a queen exchange after which Black's two passed pawns will be unstoppable.
554,24,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',The Englund gambit...not particularly strong against White's best play but playable.

589,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone I have decided to annotate a couple of very lucky wins.  After the disappointing result of the Beafyness tourney two players put a smile on my face by waving the white flag.  But as you will see from these two games the chessic illness I suffer from passivitis is still with me.  But I got away with it and as a result you could certainly call me a lucky so and so!  This game started out as a Guicco Piano.
590,26,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3. ........ Bc5 - these moves characterise the centre-contesting Guicco Piano.

595,26,6,1Qe2,b'r2q1rk1/1p1b1ppp/p1pp1n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1PNP4/PP1BQPPP/R4R1K b - -',12. Qe2 - sensible development from my 1300  opponent.

598,26,9,2Rfd1,b'r1r3k1/q2b2pn/p1pp1p1p/1p2p3/3PP3/PP2QNNP/1P3PP1/2RR3K b - -',22. Rfd1! - here it looks as though white can open some lines here to his advantage.  I did analyse that I would be a pawn down in a wretched position.  I was seriously considering waving the white flag.  Had it been an Expert or dmaestro I probably would have but wait my opponent has a 1300  rating.  I will see what he does on his next move before I make any decisions.  I play Be6 and say my prayers.

Henry is rather draughty here but behold - my second rank is empty but for one piece - Glenda!  If she senses danger to her other half she will be over there believe you me but first I have the seed of an idea of attacking the enemy king down the h file and it germinates over the next few moves and it will be me with the extra booty!

604,26,15,3Ng1,b'2q4r/2r3k1/p1ppbpp1/1p2p3/1P1PPp2/P4Q1P/1P4P1/3R1RNK b - -',32. Ng1 - however because of the pin on the h file the Wicked Witch of the West is skewered to her castle by Frere Leblanc on my next turn and me already a pawn up will now be the exchange for a pawn up!
605,26,16,Qe7,b'7r/2r1q1k1/p1pp1pp1/1p2p3/1P1PPp2/P4N1P/1P4P1/3Q1R1K w - -',35. ......... Qe7 - now it is my turn to b****r about.  I think I should have got in my g5 move here instead of next move.  To lose one tempo can be costly.  Thankfully not here.
606,26,17,g4,b'7r/2r1q1k1/p1pp1p2/1p2p3/1P1PPpp1/P2Q3P/1P1N2P1/5R1K w - -',37. .......... g4 - a pleasant surprise awaits me in that he waves the white flag.  In his resignation note he said that he felt that I was subjecting him to slow strangulation.  Me jstevens1 doing that to an opponent?  Well maybe I am starting to learn some lessons from my higher rated opponents and am finally putting them into practice!  Joanne

Just for the benefit of newcomers to the annotations gallery my first ever game with Coach Ion which I annotated as Battle of the Wings started off as a Scotch.  White deviates to a Goring Gambit on his next move.

Nxb5 - I decided to let the b pawn go in order to tuck Henry away on the kingside and to bring another defender to the weak pawn on f7 which is pinned against Henry.  Somehow I must drive the Wicked Witch of the West off the a2-g8 diagonal.
614,27,7,1Qc6,b'r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2q2n2/1Nb1p1N1/4P3/1Q6/PP4PP/R1B2R1K w - -',14. ........ Qc6 - opens up Frere Leblanc's diagonal.  My next move h6 prepares the possibility of putting Fere Leblanc on e6 developing my bishop connecting my rooks and driving the Witch off that diagonal unpinning the f7 pawn by driving back the white knight.
615,27,8,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2q2n1p/2b1p3/4P3/1QN2N2/PP4PP/R1B2R1K w - -',16. ......... Re8 - backing up my e pawn.

This was the first time that I had managed to maintain a clear pawn lead against an Expert.  There seemed to be no weaknesses but this just seemed too good to be true.  I let the emotional baggage from my past performances against the Expert colour my judgement here.  I offered Jim a draw.  I half expected a refusal.  If the refusal was to come with an exchange of queens I would recapture with Frere Lenoir otherwise Frere Leblanc would come to e6 and drive back the Witch followed by the move Ne7 to protect my e pawn and to prepare f6 to bolster it.  But he accepted the draw offer and I received 7.1 points for this high draw.  At the end of the game Ion assessed the position as Black has a clear advantage.  I suppose in one way I am in a win win situation here.  If the advantage is with white then it was a good draw offer.  If it was a bad draw offer then it is nice to end the game with the better of things against a player 300 points north of my rating.  In any case it ensured that although I came bottom of the league I did not leave Beafyness' tourney with nul point.  It was Un Demi Point.  

My opponent had the following to add - hope you can follow:-

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3 [4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nxc6 Qf6= ] 

4...dxc3 5.Bc4 [5.Nxc3 Nf6= ] 

5...d6 I have always thought this best 

6.0-0 Nf6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Ng5 Ne5 9.Bb5 [>=9.Nxc3!? is interesting 9...h6 10.Nf3=/  ] 

9...c6-/  10.f4 cxb5 11.fxe5 dxe5 12.Nxc3 Dunno whether Be3 is better? 
12….Bc5  13.Kh1 0-0 14.Nxb5 [14.Nd5!? Nxd5 15.exd5-  ]

617,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone just to say that I am annotating my final two remaining games in Beafyness' tournament.  These two are against a strong Expert called therealjimfriar.  Jim has recently beaten an international master so I was pleased to come away with half a point out of my two games with him.  I think I will give you the bad news first with this game which started off as a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.
618,28,1,Bg4,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',5. ......... Bg4 - this is recommended as the strongest response to the standard book 5. 0-0.  It is trappy.  You try to drive black's lsb away with h3 but wait black plays h5.  You really have to be careful about when you take that bishop because you as white may cop Old Matey on the open h file after the Wicked Witch of the West comes to h4!
619,28,2,d3,b'r2qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p5/4p2p/4P1b1/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',7. d3 - opens up Frere Lenoir's diagonal.
620,28,3,1d4,b'r3kb1r/1pp2pp1/p1p2qn1/4p2p/3PP1b1/5N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',10. d4 - counters in the centre.  I just wonder if I should have taken on e5 at an opportune moment.
621,28,4,Rxh4,b'r3k3/1pp2pp1/p1pb2n1/4p3/3PP2r/8/PPPN1PP1/R1B1R1K1 w q -',14. ........ Rxh4 - this plethora of exchanges gives some relief to white down the h file but there could still be a doubling of the rooks to contend with.  My next move Nf3 clears Fere Lenoir's diagonal and puts the question to the black rook.
622,28,5,1Be3,b'r3k3/1pp2pp1/p1pb2n1/4p2r/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b q -',16. Bf3 - develops my last piece - in the world database it does have a good percentage rating in favour of white.
623,28,6,1g3,b'r3k3/1pp3p1/p1pb1pn1/4p2r/3PP3/4BNP1/PPP2P2/R3R1K1 b q -',17. g3 - still following the sequence in the database and creating g2 for Henry to bolster a rook challenge on the h file but I wonder whether I should have exchanged on e5 here.
624,28,7,c5,b'4r3/1pp2kp1/p2b1pn1/2p4r/3BP3/5NP1/PPP2PK1/3RR3 w - -',20. ......... c5 - and here Jim takes me out of the database and starts the pawns rolling.  In order to avoid dropping a pawn here I must retreat Frere Lenoir to c3. 
625,28,8,2Bd2,b'4r3/2p3p1/p2bkpn1/8/1p2P3/5NP1/1PPB1PK1/7R b - -',26. Bd2 - Jim has achieved a lot in his last few moves.  He now gets the pawn majority on the queenside.  I move the rook to a1 but would Rh7 have been a better try here hitting at the g7 pawn and tying down one of black's pieces to it and then using one of my minor pieces to deal with the queenside pawn roll.
626,28,9,a4,b'r7/6p1/3bkpn1/8/pp2P3/4BNP1/1P3PK1/R7 w - -',30. ........ a4 - deadly.
627,28,10,3Ne1,b'r7/6p1/3bkp2/4n3/pp1BP3/6P1/1P3PK1/R3N3 b - -',32. Ne1 - I eschew exchanges on e5 to try and get my knight to take over defensive duties of a1 - Jim does not give me the chance to do this however.
628,28,11,3Nc6,b'r7/6p1/2nbkp2/8/pp1BP3/6P1/1P3PK1/R3N3 w - -',32. ........ Nc6 - gains a tempo by attacking Frere Lenoir who retreats to e3.
629,28,12,bxa3,b'r7/6p1/2nbkp2/8/4P3/p3B1P1/5PK1/R3N3 w - -',34. ......... bxa3 - Jim's mission is accomplished.  One deadly passer on the a file.
630,28,13,3Bb2,b'r7/6p1/2nbkp2/8/4P3/6P1/pB3PK1/R3N3 b - -',36. Bb2 - to try and prevent the enemy dsb from controlling that a1-h8 diagonal.  Jim forces a trade of bishops on his next move.
631,28,14,Kxe5,b'r7/6p1/2n2p2/4k3/4P3/6P1/p4PK1/R3N3 w - -',37. ........ Kxe5 - recaptures with the king - this king is making his way down to b2.
632,28,15,Kd4,b'r7/6p1/2n2p2/8/3kP3/5PP1/p5K1/R3N3 w - -',38. .......... Kd4.  There is no way I can stop Jim's king from getting to b2.  Henry is too far away to help and neither he nor his steed can stop Jim's plan so I wave the white flag.  On to my next annotation - now for the good news ..................
633,29,0,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',The Trompowsky Attack!  Unusual but perfectly okay.  
634,29,1,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n1p/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',?!  Not as good as the normal responses: Ne4 e6 or d5.  Still this forces white to decide what to do with the bishop.
635,29,2,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/5n1p/6p1/3P3B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq g6',I decide to develop my kingside aggressively.  Perhaps Bg7 d6 and Bf5 are in the cards for me leading to an interesting kingside presence and then most likely Nd7 and a queenside castle.
636,29,3,Ne4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/7p/6p1/3Pn3/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',?!  Wasting time to go after the bishop when I know I should be playing either Bg7 or d6 (or even d5).
637,29,4,Be5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/7p/4B1p1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Also not a very strong move; sure it threatens the rook but white should be developing his pieces.
638,29,5,f6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/5p1p/4B1p1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',?!  This isn't a very good move; it exposes black's kingside significantly.  Better was Nf6 or Rg8.
639,29,6,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/5p1p/4B1p1/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Such an innocuous move when the only thing I had considered at this point was 6. Bg3 Nxg3 where white has a disrupted pawn structure and black can begin development.
640,29,7,fxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/7p/4p1p1/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',??  Loses immediately.  A stupid capture that shows my blindness.  Why?
641,29,8,Qh5#,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/7p/4p1pQ/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq -',Augh!  It's like Fool's Mate and I fell for it!  Merry Christmas NN.
642,30,0,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',When I open with 1.d4: if black moves d5 or Nf6 I play 2.c4.
643,30,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',King's Indian defence. It's the first time I face it.
644,30,2,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',With 4.e4 I got a big centre control.
645,30,3,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',It's the first time I play this opening....but I like it!
646,30,4,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',I could castle but it's only a question of time.

648,30,6,Qc2,b'rnbq1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/1p4B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Qc2!
Analyzing the position you can understand it's a good move if black plays Bg4."
649,30,7,b4,b'rn1q1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/6B1/1pPPP1b1/2N5/PPQNBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Like I thought.
650,30,8,1Bxf6,b'rn1q1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1Bp1/8/1pPPP1b1/2N5/PPQNBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now very nice exchanges starts!
651,30,9,1Bxe2,b'rn1q1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1Bp1/8/1pPPP3/2N5/PPQNbPPP/R4RK1 w - -',The beautiful thing is that a piece who captures another one is never taken just after it takes.
652,30,10,1Bxg7,b'rn1q1rk1/4ppBp/p1pp2p1/8/1pPPP3/2N5/PPQNbPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Bxg7.

659,30,17,1b3,b'rn4k1/4pp1p/p1pp2pB/q7/2PPP3/1P6/P1Qp1PPP/5RK1 b - -',b3 to protect a3.
660,30,18,1g5,b'rn4k1/4pp1p/p1pp3B/q5p1/2PPP3/1P6/P1Qp1PPP/5RK1 w - -',Black want to cover BSD with a pawn. Now I can try Bxg5 or even Rd1.
661,30,19,1Rd1,b'rn4k1/4pp1p/p1pp3B/q5p1/2PPP3/1P6/P1Qp1PPP/3R2K1 b - -',I chose the 2nd.

Well with dxe5 (or exd4 and then Rxd4 ) White has a very big advantage!
So even if Black plays Qxa2."

That's why he resigns. I've just won against a 1600 rated. Wow!
For my level it's a great result....Anyway what are your opinions about this game?"
666,31,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I have heard from a friend that 2...d5 response makes the black have a better position in king's gambit.I played this move by trusting this rumour.
667,31,1,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Here we exchanged the pawns.
668,31,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This move is to prevent Qh4  i think.Because after another move(for example Nc3) 4...Qh4  5.g3 fxg3 6.hxg3 Qxh3 so he stays one pawn back cannot capture with h pawn.Or he would play Ke2 and would not be able to castle anymore.probably there are other possibilities that i missed.if you help me with your comments i will be very thankful.
669,31,3,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',With the idea of Bh4 
670,31,4,Qxh4+,b'rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p1q/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He is forced to move his king.
671,31,5,Bg4+,b'rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5pbq/2N5/PPPPK1PP/R1BQ1B1R w kq -',Here he resigns.
672,32,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't often meet Alekhine's Defence.  The idea of the opening is for Black to encourage White to overreach himself and then to strike back exploiting the holes in White's defences.  So in planning to meet it White either has to guard against over-exuberance or make sure that his attack wins quickly - not an option against a decent player of the Black pieces.
673,32,1,Qxd6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/3q4/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',? Exposing Black's Queen too early in the game.  This contradicts opening principles generally and in the Alekhine particularly.  4...exd6 or 4....cxd6 were much safer.
674,32,2,Qb4+,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/1qBP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',"? a second Queen move before Black has developed his other pieces.  However White must be careful not to try to ""punish"" his opponent too soon or he will also fail to develop quickly."
675,32,3,Nd2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/1qBP4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',blocking the check developing the N and defending the B all with one move
676,32,4,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3n4/1qBP4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',probably the wrong pawn as this deprives the Nb8 of its natural square and fails to allow the Bf8 room to breathe.  On the other hand if Black is making so many mistakes in the opening why did it take 68 moves for me to finish him off?!
677,32,5,g6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/q2n4/2BP4/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',so now the Bf8 is going to g7 where it will bite on granite.  Another strange choice by my higher-rated opponent.

679,32,7,1Re1,b'r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/2n3p1/q2p4/3P4/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',The pawn has cost me the two bishops allowed Black to develop his N on an ideal square and cost me two tempi.  I don't think I should have grabbed this pawn at all!  On the other hand black is saddled with an immobile isolated pawn so it's not all bad.
680,32,8,1Bg5,b'r4rk1/ppq2pbp/2n3p1/3p1bB1/3P4/1NP2N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',developing my last minor piece to a good square controlling d8 the natural square from which to defend d5.

689,32,17,bxa5,b'8/8/2n2pk1/p2p2p1/3P3P/2PqNPB1/b5P1/4Q1K1 w - -',Now Black has a prime asset in his remote passed pawn but while so many pieces are still on the board it is not yet a winning advantage.  White still has one more pawn and his pieces are well placed.

If I play Rxg3 b4 Nb1? a3! and I am lost! Do you see it? If I play
Nb1 at once b4 and then I cannot avoid to lose the knight for the a3 pawn to say the less. 
If Rxg3 b4 Ne2 is slightly better since I have room for my King to go to b1-a1 to stop the a pawn. But who wants to play with a pinned king?
(Rxg3 b4 Ne2 a3 b2xa3 b4xa3 Kb1 a2 Ka1... ok I can probably came out of this one but it looks weird). 
Ok so look to Kb1. It looks good since it gives the king a precious time to stop the a pawn. But: 
Kb1 c5! now if I go Rxg3 Rxh6... threatening mate in 1! After Rh3 I can stop it but does it look good?
Ok so let's take a look against the other black's attack line: 
Kb1 b4. Na2 and then apparently everything is under control except that black can play c5 I lose h6 AND I have a delicate situation for the control of the 1 line and the weak g2 pawn.

827,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I liked this game because of the end game. I was down 2 pawns to 3 with a rook each hoping against hope for a draw and turned it around to a rook vs 3 pawns.
828,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',You know the drill. :)

When I play white I play the exact same opening so why should I do what I would want me to do if I was playing me?
So I looked for something different about 8 months into my GK life and I found this. Things begin to happen much faster with this opening and some players even make an early blunder thus allowing me an easy advantage."
830,39,3,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Not the most common white response but I don't mind it at all. I like to escape the monotony of boring four knights openings. :)
831,39,4,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move was just trying something new. I saw it in the database and liked it so I figured: why not? It looked fun. So I played it.
832,39,5,Bxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Seems free right?
833,39,6,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',Well okay not FREE per se. Bishop's only safe retreat gets the bishop and knight forked.
834,39,7,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pN3/3PB3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',A fine move the pieces were going to be exchanged anyways white just did it his way.
835,39,8,Qxd8+,b'r1bQkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',An inevitable loss... the castling king. I believe that this is why I ended up with a losing position coming into the end game. It's now going to take me 3 moves to castle at the very minimum. White even has ways of stopping that castle from ever taking place.
836,39,9,Bg5+,b'r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P1B1/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',All white wants to do right now is develop before black has a chance- white's advantage is that he can spend 2 extra moves developing while blacks trying to castle. I don't know if I agree with this move however as black then gets a bishop exchange AND moves his king to e7 leaving only 2 moves left in his castle and now white no longer has moves to stop the castle. White has just effectively shortened his 2 move lead to a one move lead.
837,39,10,1Bxe7+,b'r1bk3r/ppp1Bppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',I think I might have just pulled back to f4 as white even after the wasted check. I don't understand why white wants to trade bishops as if black ever gets the initiative back his white bishop can be a lot more powerful than white's knight.
838,39,11,1Kxe7,b'r1b4r/ppp1kppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Re8 or Rd8 allow me to get my king into a castled position as well as either attacking a pawn or taking a file.
839,39,12,1Nc3,b'r1b4r/ppp1kppp/8/4P3/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Again white is developing. It's obvious he would like to queen side castle immediately laying claim to the d file but there is nothing black can do to stop that. 
840,39,13,1Bf5,b'r6r/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Bishop protects pawn only logical move I found.
841,39,14,1O-O-O,b'r6r/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',White completes his queen side castle still a move up on black.
842,39,15,1Rhd8,b'r2r4/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',"At this point I'm willing to exchange for the open d file because my e pawn and bishop may be able to team up with my rook to make a better attack than his knight can ever hope to achieve.
Better for black is Ke6 attacking the week pawn and leaving the king in the middle of the board- if the rooks get traded black is going to want to be in the center not back on f8."
843,39,16,1Nd5+,b'r2r4/ppp1kppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',So white now gains a pawn. Kd7 doesn't work because of the double check from Nb6. All right well this isn't a devastating set back is it? We'll soon see for sure.
844,39,17,1Kf8,b'r2r1k2/ppp2ppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Okay the good news is that black has finally completed his castle. The bad news is that it is now much harder for black to get his king into the battle against the e5 pawn which he should have done earlier.
845,39,18,1Nxc7,b'r2r1k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',White has guaranteed a winning endgame position here.
846,39,19,1Rxd1+,b'r4k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2Kr3R w - -',It seems to me this was a stupid mistake on my part. I did not have to give up the open file and I didn't have to trade rooks right now as more trading will only bring the end game that much quicker and I'm already down a pawn.
847,39,20,1Rxd1,b'r4k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b - -',Obvious move claiming the open file.
848,39,21,1Rc8,b'2r2k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w - -',The only rational move this move also has a look on the c2 square if ...e3 fxe3 Rxc2  and then white's pawns are reduced to cannon fodder. However this is no more than a dream as whites Nd5 immediately quashes all hopes for that.
849,39,22,1Nd5,b'2r2k2/pp3ppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b - -',Now if ...e3 then Nxe3 thus protecting the c2 square as well as attacking blacks winning bishop.
850,39,23,1Re8,b'4rk2/pp3ppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w - -',At this point I'm desperate to get the pawn back... the end is coming closer and closer by the second and I'm frantically trying what I can.
851,39,24,1Ne3,b'4rk2/pp3ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/4N3/PPP2PPP/2KR4 b - -',Attacks the bishop but allows black to gain the pawn back. I make the mistake of assuming I have to get the pawn now and lose my strong bishop because of it.
852,39,25,1Rxe5,b'5k2/pp3ppp/8/4rb2/4p3/4N3/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w - -',Well at least we have an even score and the position could be worse for black.
853,39,26,Rxf5,b'5k2/pp3ppp/8/5r2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR4 w - -',So now black is attacking white's fgh pawns with the hopes and dreams of one day pushing that e pawn for the win. Hopes and dreams nothing more.
854,39,27,1Rd7,b'5k2/pp1R1ppp/8/5r2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2K5 b - -',White forsakes his pawns for the exchange.
855,39,28,2Rxb7,b'5k2/pR3ppp/8/8/4p3/8/PPP2rPP/2K5 b - -',Even again.
856,39,29,2e3,b'5k2/pR3ppp/8/8/8/4p3/PPP2rPP/2K5 w - -',"It seems now that black may have been better off with the simpler Rxg2 then after 21 Rxa7 Rxh2. On move 22 white's rook is limited in where he can move and black now has the chance to get behind the pawn.
A hasty mistake it seems."
857,39,30,2Kd1,b'5k2/pR3ppp/8/8/8/4p3/PPP2rPP/3K4 b - -',The king moves in of course. If e2 then Ke1 blocks the queening and now black can't even look at the cba pawns without a lot more work.
858,39,31,2Rxg2,b'5k2/pR3ppp/8/8/8/4p3/PPP3rP/3K4 w - -',black takes the pawn now better late than never.
859,39,32,f5,b'5k2/R5pp/8/5p2/8/4p3/PPP3rP/3K4 w - f6',Now as black I want to get my f-pawn into the attack. The rook moved over giving him a clear shot the problem is that it will take way too many moves to even get that pawn close enough.
860,39,33,2b4,b'5k2/R5pp/8/5p2/1P6/4p3/P1P3rP/3K4 b - b3',White even has time to push his pawns setting up for a better position after the exchange.
861,39,34,2Ra5,b'5k2/6pp/8/R7/1P3p2/4p3/P1P3rP/3K4 b - -',Now white looks to fork on f5. Very easy to avoid really.
862,39,35,2f3,b'5k2/6pp/8/R7/1P6/4pp2/P1P3rP/3K4 w - -',Or....you could just not avoid it? Can't honestly tell you what was going through my head... a very sharp needle or something I'd assume.
863,39,36,2Rf5+,b'5k2/6pp/8/5R2/1P6/4pp2/P1P3rP/3K4 b - -',Losing the pawn here is devastating for black but it's not over yet. Let's see what the king can accomplish.
864,39,37,e2+,b'8/4k1pp/8/8/1P6/5R2/P1P1p1rP/3K4 w - -',Okay so now I have to push or the pawn gets it.
865,39,38,Rxh2,b'8/4k1pp/8/8/1P6/5R2/P1P1p2r/4K3 w - -',Enjoying a light snack of pawn crunchables.
866,39,39,2a4,b'8/4k1pp/8/8/PP6/5R2/2P1p2r/4K3 b - a3',Pushing more pieces towards the queening ranks. Blacks going to have trouble now.
867,39,40,2h5,b'8/4k1p1/8/7p/PP6/5R2/2P1p2r/4K3 w - h6',"I chose to move my rook back to attack the pawns as c3 solidifies white's position too much for my likings.
Instead I'm going to see if my h pawn can promise any death and destruction after an exchange."
868,39,41,2Re3+,b'8/4k1p1/8/7p/PP6/4R3/2P1p2r/4K3 b - -',Okay so white finally chooses to win the pawn. Once the rooks are traded there will be no stopping the a b c pawns from marching to victory.
869,39,42,3Rxe2,b'8/6p1/3k4/7p/PP6/8/2P1R2r/4K3 b - -',That powerful e pawn has finally taken his last breath. *funeral music plays in the distance* If not for that stupid f pawn dropping the e pawn may have one day grown up to be the queen but she was stabbed in the back by one of her closes friends. 
870,39,43,3Rh4,b'8/6p1/3k4/7p/PP5r/8/2P1R3/4K3 w - -',Then I trade roo---- wait what? No! I can't trade rooks! Not yet! I must keep trying!
871,39,44,3c3,b'8/6p1/3k4/7p/PP5r/2P5/4R3/4K3 b - -',But of course! Secures white's little pawn party which of course I wasn't invited to.
872,39,45,3g5,b'8/8/3k4/6pp/PP5r/2P5/4R3/4K3 w - g6',Okay so now that I got rid of the pesky f pawn there will be nobody to stop the g pawn from achieving her goal of becoming a queen right? Well... you'll have to wait and see!
873,39,46,3Rg2,b'8/8/3k4/6pp/PP5r/2P5/6R1/4K3 b - -',White's trying to limit blacks squares and succeeding give the cba pawns even more power.
874,39,47,3Rg3,b'8/8/3k4/7p/PP4pr/2P3R1/8/4K3 b - -',White doesn't want black moving to h3 it seems.
875,39,48,3Rh1+,b'8/8/3k4/7p/PP4p1/2P3R1/8/4K2r w - -',Perhaps maybe I can still get a draw by getting my rook to do enough damage to the cba crew before white picks of my last few men?
876,39,49,Kd5,b'8/8/8/3k3p/PP4p1/2P3R1/5K2/7r w - -',The king wants to join the battle... 
877,39,50,Rc1,b'8/8/8/3k3p/PP4p1/2P3R1/6K1/2r5 w - -',White's king claims the corner making it harder for me to run my g and h pawns up after any exchange of rooks.
878,39,51,3a5,b'8/8/8/P2k3p/1P4p1/2P3R1/6K1/2r5 b - -',"Okay so white's now just taking his time. If black moves c4 and tries to exchange rooks the a pawn becomes a queen faster than you can say taco sauce!
But it's not over yet!"
879,39,52,3Rc2+,b'8/8/8/P2k3p/1P4p1/2P3R1/2r3K1/8 w - -',"And now I see it. Remember the e pawn earlier betrayed by her dearest friend f who was secretly working with the white side and ruined her chances of ever becoming a queen? Well do you also remember then that the g pawn who can no longer be betrayed by the evil f pawn also one day wants to become a queen?
Well it just so happens that there's a third piece that wants to one day be promoted. The h pawn. He however hopes to one day be a rook as he's really not into cross-dressing. And he's willing to do anything he has to do it. Luckily his high school buddy the rook is willing to help!"
880,39,53,3Kh1,b'8/8/8/P2k3p/1P4p1/2P3R1/2r5/7K b - -',Step one: force the white king out of the corner unless white instead chooses to have a draw. Yeah right.
881,39,54,3Kg2,b'8/8/8/P2k3p/1P4p1/2P3R1/6K1/2r5 b - -',Back and forth we go where we're headed nobody knows! Okay so basically anywhere not on the e file really.
882,39,55,h4,b'8/8/8/P2k4/1P4pp/2P3R1/2r5/4K3 w - -',Now that black has gotten the king out of the corner phase two of the plan begins: shove your buddy in front of the guard and make a run for it.
883,39,56,4Rxg4,b'8/8/8/P2k4/1P4Rp/2P5/2r5/4K3 b - -',It's the guards duty to kill trespassers so that's what he does of course.
884,39,57,4h3,b'8/8/8/P2k4/1P4R1/2P4p/2r5/4K3 w - -',Run pawn run! RUN!!!
885,39,58,4c4+,b'8/8/8/P2k4/1PP3R1/7p/2r5/4K3 b - -',White see's what's coming and he decides to take this free move to get his pawns one space closer to a queen of his one.
886,39,59,4Kc6,b'8/8/2k5/P7/1PP3R1/7p/2r5/4K3 w - -',I want to be in front of the pawns once any trading goes down. 
887,39,60,4Rh6,b'8/2k5/7R/P7/1PP5/7p/2r5/4K3 b - -',Okay so the rook finally decides to attack the h pawn.
888,39,61,4h2,b'8/2k5/7R/P7/1PP5/8/2r4p/4K3 w - -',Aaaaand now he's safe again.
889,39,62,4Rh7+,b'8/2k4R/8/P7/1PP5/8/2r4p/4K3 b - -',But where on Earth will my king go? Oh no!
890,39,63,4Kd1,b'1k6/7R/8/P7/1PP5/8/2r4p/3K4 b - -',White decides to poke the rook though I can't for the life of me tell you what he hopes to get out of it.
891,39,64,Kb8,b'1k6/7R/8/P7/1PP5/8/r6p/3K4 w - -',"So at this point I finally open my eyes and say ""enough of this crap!"""
892,39,65,Kg7,b'7R/6k1/8/P7/1PP5/8/r6p/3K4 w - -',White has to stay on h to avoid getting mated.
893,39,66,5Rh3,b'8/6k1/8/P7/1PP5/7R/r6p/3K4 b - -',And now remember how that h pawn would do anything to become a rook? Sacrifice his buddy? Endanger his old friend the rook? Well he wants to be a rook so bad even if only for a second that he's willing to die for it. And that's exactly what he does.
894,39,67,5Kb3,b'8/6k1/8/P7/1PP5/1K6/8/7r b - -',NOW the game gets interesting. black has gone from a slight hope to draw to a chance at winning.
895,39,68,5b5,b'5k2/8/8/PP6/2P5/1K6/8/7r b - -',Black's king however has a long ways to go to get in the battle.
896,39,69,5Rh7,b'5k2/7r/8/PP6/2P5/1K6/8/8 w - -',This was a mistake. I eventually wanted to get the rook down here but not until later: I needed him to be able to get behind the c pawn later if I wanted a chance to win.
897,39,70,Ke8,b'4k3/7r/8/PP6/1KP5/8/8/8 w - -',If that king doesn't get to b8 before his pawns push too much all is for naught.
898,39,71,6a6,b'1k6/7r/PP6/1KP5/8/8/8/8 b - -',And now we're fine. Rook jumps around a bit not allowing white to do anything at all and eventually white accepts a draw.
899,39,72,Rh4+,b'8/Pk6/1P6/2P5/1K5r/8/8/8 w - -',"Thanks for reading about the little pawns who died an epic tale of deceit betrayal and ultimate sacrifice. If you liked it drop me a comment. If you didn't like it drop me a comment. If you agree or disagree with something drop me a comment. If you think I'm a magnificent poof drop me a comment. If you just want me to shut up...well dropping a comment would just get me to talk more.
Thanks everyone!
