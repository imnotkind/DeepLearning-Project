0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"hello everyone and today I will annotate a french  exchange between 2 C-B level players on GK. 

"
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',the french defence. In this opening black will usually have strong central point on d5 that can last very long but he will usually have trouble activating his light squared bishop. However the exchange variation gives a symmetrical and very drawish position.
2,0,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',THIS IS white's most common 2nd move choice.
3,0,3,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',the exchange variation. This is a great choice if one wishes to get a draw. White is rated lower than his opponent so this is a perfectly reasonable choice.
4,0,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"Okay but the best line by the book is 4.Nf3 Bg4!  5.Qe2ch! Qe7  6.Be3! when a draw is the most common result. I have played a this line in a short game which followed 6...Qb4ch?!  7.Nc3 Qxb2?? 8.Bc1ch 1-0  
U14 tournament Me vs. D class player 2007. This is the most common beginner's trap in the exchange and although I played this a long time ago I remember this because it was so short and simple."
5,0,5,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',this is just like a rubenstein exchange variation in the caro-kann except black's e pawn is gone in exchange for a c pawn.
6,0,6,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',preparing castling
7,0,7,h3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP3PP1/RN1QK1NR b KQ -',"This is move has a purpose denying black use of the g4 square for his bishop which he may try and play:
Bg4-h5-g6 exchanging white's good bishop. "
8,0,8,Re8+,b'rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP3PP1/RN1QK1NR w KQ -',Black who is ahead in development may try c5 at some point before playing Nc6 trying to break down the opponent's pawn structure. However this is just an idea to be implemented later maybe.
9,0,9,c6,b'rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP2NPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ -',I don't like this because it impedes the black development. Black may have had a setup Be6 Nd7Rc8c5 but I don't see what c6 really does as it denies the black knight  a good square and the d pawn can be well protected
10,0,10,Nbd7,b'r1bqr1k1/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP1QNPP1/RN2K2R w KQ -',followed maybe by Nb6
11,0,11,Qc7,b'r1b1r1k1/ppqn1ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP1QNPP1/RN3RK1 w - -',if black wants a kingside attack he will need more pieces.
12,0,12,1g3,b'r1b1r1k1/ppqn1ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB2PP/PP1QNP2/RN3RK1 b - -',black had no immediate threats. It is unnecessary and even bad to weaken the king like this without developing.
13,0,13,1b5,b'r1b1r1k1/p1qn1ppp/2pb1n2/1p1p2B1/3P4/2PB2PP/PP1QNP2/RN3RK1 w - b6',I don't see black's plan if he has one. Can someone tell me what they see? All I see is maybe a4 then b4 attacking the pawn chain.
14,0,14,1b4,b'r1b1r1k1/p1qn1ppp/2pb1n2/1p1p2B1/1P1P4/2PB2PP/P2QNP2/RN3RK1 b - b3',this leaves a c4 hole. 
15,0,15,1a5,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn1ppp/2pb1n2/pp1p2B1/1P1P4/2PB2PP/P2QNP2/RN3RK1 w - a6',black is going to get an open a file for the rook.
16,0,16,1cxb4,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn1ppp/2pb1n2/1p1p2B1/PP1P4/3B2PP/3QNP2/RN3RK1 b - -',now black can win a pawn.
17,0,17,1Na3,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn1ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/pP1P4/N2B2PP/3QNP2/R4RK1 b - -',the knight really doesn't have prospects here but I don't think white wanted to lose another pawn with Nc3.
18,0,18,1Ne4,b'r1b1r1k1/2qn1ppp/2pb4/3p2B1/pP1Pn3/N2B2PP/3QNP2/R4RK1 w - -',the knight is excellently placed here.
19,0,19,1Bxe4,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/pP1PB3/N3Q1PP/4NP2/R4RK1 b - -',now white gives up his good bishop to take off the e4 knight just to find that the f6 knight takes it's place.
20,0,20,1f3,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2ppp/2pb4/3p2B1/pP1Pn3/N3QPPP/4N3/R4RK1 b - -',a really disgusting move in my opinion because of black's next move.
21,0,21,1Bxh3,b'r3r1k1/2q2ppp/2pb4/3p2B1/pP1Pn3/N3QPPb/4N3/R4RK1 w - -',now black wins more material and his position will still be better.
22,0,22,Rxe4,b'r5k1/2q2ppp/2pb4/3p2B1/pP1Pr3/N3Q1Pb/4N3/R4RK1 w - -',black has 3 pawns for the piece and white's kingside is shattered.
23,0,23,Bxf1,b'r5k1/2q2ppp/2pb4/3p2B1/pP1Pr3/N5P1/4NQ2/R4bK1 w - -',now black will easily win. White gives up.
24,1,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Caro-Kann Defence. I've become familiar with this.
25,1,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Advance Variation. I like this as Black because I need to worry less about tricky manoeuvring and more about the c5-d4 battle (my pawn will move to c5 soon). On ho!
26,1,2,Bg5,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',(?!) I was a bit surprised by this. It's very interesting what he's done and I wasn't sure how to react. 5. ... f6 seemed to weaken my kingside more than needed and I didn't want to play 5. ... Ne7 or 5. ... Be7 because I wanted my Bishop to be able to take at c5 once I pushed my c-pawn. So I played my favourite move of this opening.
27,1,3,Qb6,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',I very much like the Qb6-Bc5 barrage aiming at f2. It cripples White if he can't castle fast enough. However castling doesn't take much effort.
28,1,4,b3,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/3P4/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I thought this move weakened important squares however I later realised it was one of White's better options. 6. Qc1 is quite immobilising and 6. Bc1 just wastes time developing the Bg5. He wants to keep that pawn.
29,1,5,Bb4+,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/1b1P4/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',(?!) Perhaps better is 6. ... c5.
30,1,6,Nfd2,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/1b1P4/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',(?) Better is 7.c3 cleanly shunting off the Bb4 and strengthening d4. If 7. ... Bxb1 8. cxb4 Qxb4+ 9. Bd2 ... 10. Rxb1.
31,1,7,c5,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppPbB1/1b1P4/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',(?) Misses out on 7. ... Qxd4. Ah well it's just a blitz.
32,1,8,dxc5,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2PpPbB1/1b6/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Wants to get the pin off his Nd2 and to be able to develop his Nb1. 
33,1,9,Bxc5,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bpPbB1/8/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',But now he has to worry about f2.
34,1,10,Qe2,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bpPbB1/8/1P6/P1PNQPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',Leaves the c2 pawn hanging.
35,1,11,1Be3,b'r3k1nr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2bpPb2/8/1P2B3/P1PNQPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',(?) Moves his dark-sq Bishop for the 2nd time.
36,1,12,1Bf4,b'r3k1nr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2b1Pb2/3p1B2/1P6/P1PNQPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',3rd Time. White has lost a move in essence. In chess this is called the tempo. In this case White has lost several tempi and it's Black's turn to pounce.
37,1,13,Bxc2,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/1qn1p3/2b1P3/3p1BP1/1P6/P1bNQP1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',(?!) When I made this move I hesitated. Was it the right move to make or not? I was contemplating 13. Nc4 with a discovered attack on c2 while attacking the Qb6. 13. ... Qb4+ 14. Bd2 wasn't good enough. I thought of 13. Nc4 d3 14. Nxb6 dxe2 15. Nxa8 exf1Q+ 16. Rxf1 Kd7 but something about this variation didn't seem comfortable to me.
38,1,14,d3,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/1qn1p3/2b1P3/5BP1/1P1p3B/P1bNQP1P/RN2K2R w KQkq -',(!) A strong pawn move marching right into White's personal space.
39,1,15,1Qf3,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/1qn1p3/2b1P3/5BP1/1P1p1Q1B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R b KQkq -',The White Queen has very little squares to land.
40,1,16,1Nd4,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/1q2p3/2b1P3/3n1BP1/1P1p1Q1B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R w KQkq -',I move in more pieces for the kill. I was afraid that I might lose my aggressive advantage.
41,1,17,1Qe4,b'r3k2r/pp2nppp/1q2p3/2b1P3/3nQBP1/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R b KQkq -',A central square aiming at b7 and h7 respectively. This queen may prove deadly in future however this pins the Nd2 to its spot for if it moves ... d2+ is a discovered attack on white's Queen. However if it so happens that 16. Nc4 d2+ 17. Nbxd2 Qb4 18. Qg2 then White is in a better position. Black must be economical with his pieces.
42,1,18,1Nd5,b'r3k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bnP3/3nQBP1/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Moving more of the infantry in. At this moment I am quietly worried about my uncastled King but no immediate threats means I have to keep the aggressive advantage and keep White's options closed.
43,1,19,1g5,b'r3k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bnP1P1/3nQB2/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R b KQkq -',White looks into a kingside attack. This I am quite scared of but I know that my attack should be sufficient for this not to matter much.
44,1,20,1Rc8,b'2r1k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bnP1P1/3nQB2/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R w KQk -',Poise my Black rook quietly for the kill. I won't launch a premature attack until everyone is in on it.
45,1,21,1g6,b'2r1k2r/pp3ppp/1q2p1P1/2bnP3/3nQB2/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R b KQk -',Sacrificing the pawn on g6 for some attacking pressure.
46,1,22,1hxg6,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2bnP3/3nQB2/1P1p3B/P1bN1P1P/RN2K2R w KQk -',I remain concerned about any possible threats with 18. Bxe6 fxe6 19. Qxg6+ but as long as either my Queen or my Knight is covering the e6 square I should be fine.
47,1,23,Bxb1,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2bnP3/3nQBB1/1P1p4/P2N1P1P/Rb2K2R w KQk -',(!) I launch my attack on White's King staring by vacating the c2 square for my Nd4 to fork Ke1 and Ra1.
48,1,24,1Rxb1,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2bnP3/3nQBB1/1P1p4/P2N1P1P/1R2K2R b Kk -',19. Nxb1 leads to 19. ... Nc2+ forking Ke1 and Ra1.
49,1,25,1Nc3,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2b1P3/3nQBB1/1Pnp4/P2N1P1P/1R2K2R w Kk -',(!) Forks both Rb1 and Qe4 successfully.
50,1,26,2Qg2,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2b1P3/3n1BB1/1Pnp4/P2N1PQP/1R2K2R b Kk -',The only safe spot for White's Queen. 20. Qe3 leads to 20. ... Nc2+ and White's Q is outta here!
51,1,27,2Nxb1,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2b1P3/3n1BB1/1P1p4/P2N1PQP/1n2K2R w Kk -',Grabbing material and also clearing one piece away from a desired open c-file for my Rook.
52,1,28,2Kd1,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/2b1P3/5BB1/1P1p4/P1n2PQP/1N1K3R b k -',(?!) Perhaps 22. Kf1 was better.
53,1,29,2Bd2,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1p4/P1nB1bQP/1N1K3R b k -',White tries his best to overcome Black's chokehold...
54,1,30,2Ne3+,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1q2p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1pn3/P2B1bQP/1N1K3R w k -',...but to not much avail. Threatening Nxg2.
55,1,31,Qxe3,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/4p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1pq3/P4bQP/1N1K3R w k -',(!) The right capture. Now Black's arsenal is mostly pointed at White's King except for the Rh8 stranded in the corner. The Nb1 and Rh1 are in their original places unable to do anything about the coming invasion. This underscores the importance to develop fast and co-ordinate your pieces.
56,1,32,2Nd2,b'2r1k2r/pp3pp1/4p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1pq3/P2N1bQP/3K3R b k -',Blocking Rc1#.
57,1,33,2Rc2,b'4k2r/pp3pp1/4p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1pq3/P1rN1bQP/3K3R w k -',Threatening 26. ... Qxd2#. The only way to the delay the onslaught now is 26. Qxf2 Qxf2 but the end is inevitable.
58,1,34,Rc1#,b'4k2r/pp3pp1/4p1p1/4P3/6B1/1P1pq3/P4bQP/2rK1N1R w k -',"Qc1# is also acceptable in this scenario. As is Qe1#. 

The importance of co-ordinating pieces in a seemly fashion is a rare skill in chess of which the grandmasters know deeply about. The harmonious development of pieces each piece serving its purpose is very important. The only improvement I would make about Black's position is the castling of his king which is hard because of the doubled g-pawns but Black needed to make an aggressive attack in order to sieze the opportunity and he did. I mean I did.

Thanks for watching! You're a great listener and hope you enjoyed!"

Unfortunately for me I challenged this player when I was still 1200 but the game was finished when I was 1700 so I lost rating points for winning. However I will try to illustrate some points about my opponent's play: HE played pretty well for a 1200.

So my opponent plays e4. Here I was going to try and play an open sicilian. I would not do this against a more experienced player because I play open sicilians badly(theory theory theory) and prefer closed or alapin variations."

I'd like to play c4 but when I do it gets uncomfortable to have a hole on d3.

It's just that what usually will happen is Black will not trade on d3 -- he'll wait until I trade on e4 and then he can put a knight or something on d3 that a pawn can't chase away."

What do I like about this position?
... - My bishop on b2 is in an influential position even though it's currently blocked by my knight.
... - I feel like I have lots of potential energy and flexibility in my position. My pawns aren't committed to a specific layout and my pieces are on good squares ready to attack either side of the board.
   
What don't I like about my position?
... - his pawn on e4 makes it hard for me to maneuver.
... - if the d-file opens up after a trade he'll put a rook there I'll have to move my queen and he may even double his rooks. That'll be a substantial advantage for him.

I'm threatening to win a pawn by playing Nxe4. He won't be able to take the knight because I'd play Qxa5 and win his queen. If he takes my queen I recapture Nxd2 and save my knight. If he retreats I put the knight back on c3 and g3 and win the pawn.
 
I expect him to guard the queen with b6 or to retreat the queen to b6 or c7. Then I'll trade pawns and play Rad1. By the time he moves his rook to d8 I can play my queen to c1 and he won't control the d-file. And after the center opens up a little he'll have two pawns (on e4 and c5) that I can target while mine feel harder for him to attack."

If he doesn't play c4 and I'm thinking he won't because he gives up control in the center I'll have to decide what to do with the queen. I want to leave the d-file and let the rook have it instead of the queen. I haven't looked at Qe2 or e4 yet. Qb5 doesn't thrill me because I feel my queen is doing more than his is."
176,7,10,1Qe3,b'2rrn1k1/pp3ppp/4bb2/q7/2p5/1PN1QB2/PBP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',"To me this is the toughest kind of position. There are lots of ways to do captures and if you do it in the wrong order you lose. Dan Heisman who's written lots of chess books and has a column on Chess Cafe describes it as a tactic: Counting. And he also claims that it's the tactic that so often causes you to lose because you don't look far enough ahead or at all of the possible captures to determine if it's safe or not.

Here I looked a little at Rxd8 to get his rook off of the c-file (I'm afraid that after everything clears it's going to capture the pawn on c2 and win because of that) but I can't give him the open d-file. That also leads to doom & destruction for me. Qxb7 doesn't work because he just plays Bxc3 and wins a knight. I looked a long time at Na4 to move the knight (that's attacked twice and guarded just once) and it guards the bishop from there. If he plays Bxb2 I recapture with the knight. I have a threat against d8 from my rook. If his bishop goes to f5 to help the rook move to c2 my queen will have a threat against e8. So I was almost ready to play Na4. 
 But you always have to ask: what if he ignores the trade. If he plays b5 then he's attacking my bishop and knight. I pretty much have to play Bxf6 but he recaptures with the knight (Nxf6) and now he's attacking my knight on a4 with a pawn and my queen on e4 with the knight. I can play Qe5 to temporarily pin his pawn but I don't think this will turn out well. Plus he can trade pawns and then play Rxc2 and have a win. So maybe the best I can do is play Qe3. If he trades the knight (which he won't) then my pieces start to escape. More likely he adds pressure but now I can play Na4 and if he plays b5 I can trade bishops and then move the knight -- and he won't be attacking my queen.
 
Now that I've made the move it suddenly hits me that I didn't consider him playing cxb3. I can't recapture cxb3 because I lose the knight; three pieces attacking it and only two guarding it. I'll have to recapture axb3 and attack his queen so he can't stop and take my knight. Maybe he'll play Qc7 so he's still attacking it three times. I can rescue the knight with Nb5 attacking his queen but he plays Qxc2 and wins a pawn. That doesn't look good for me down a pawn and rapidly coming to the endgame. This isn't looking good for our team. My partner was swept and it's looking like I'm heading for the wrong side of a sweep too."

If he plays Na2 I'm happy to trade bishops. I'm curious if he'll threaten my other bishop with Nh4 again. I don't think he would because I'll just recapture with the knight.

Maybe I can start looking at some counter-attacks. I'd like to play c5. It's guarded three times. I'd probably recapture with the bishop so it is attacking f2 and so my knight on d7 then attacks the pawn on e5. That's if he trades. But before I can do that I'll want to play a6 so his knight can't come up to b5. I like it that his knight doesn't have any strong squares to move to right now."

After I trade on c5 I'm expecting Rc3.
Or maybe he'll let me capture on c4 and then on b3 and play Rxb3 aiming at my pawn on b7. It's not like my king can get out of the center.
I gotta think about this. My other choice is to retreat the queen like to c6 so he can't use the b-file for his attack. I think/hope I'll be playing Kd7 eventually to link my rooks.

437,17,0,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',Usually d5 is the most popular reply to Nf3. It lets Black establish a strong pawn center. Nf6 is another popular move for a symmetrical game perhaps for a while. But I taught my kids the Dutch Defense to d4 a few months ago so let's see if he'll let me transpose into it.
438,17,1,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',See now we're playing the Dutch. The Dutch can lead to wild and exciting games -- that's the number one thing I'm interested in when I play chess. It's nice to win but it's even better for me to have an interesting and fun game.
439,17,2,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And I'm going to use a Stonewall setup. That's where there are pawns on c6 d5 e6 and f5.
440,17,3,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3P1p2/3P4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Shock! That is not a typical move and I didn't find it referenced in any of my books on the Dutch. Usually when White plays d4 c4 openings. he keeps the tension on d5 long into the game. I wonder if he thinks he sees something to exploit.
441,17,4,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3b1n2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The dark bishop is extremely important in the Dutch. With the pawns on all of the White squares it's up to this bishop to protect the dark ones. It's important to be thinking about what you're going to do to cover your weaknesses in your games.

I haven't made any terribly weak moves so he's developing more pieces before trying to start an attack."
443,17,6,Ne5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pb1n2/3pNp2/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',That's normal in the Dutch. White's knight likes to go to e5 and Black's knight will go to e4. Sometimes you get real wild positions if those knights are traded off and pawns recapture -- you end up with a white pawn on e5 and a black pawn on e4.
444,17,7,Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp4pp/2pbbn2/3pNp2/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',It's a little easier for me to develop in this game since he's taken the pawn on e6. Normally to use this bishop it either has to go to b7 or go to d7 then e8 and then f7 or h5.
445,17,8,1Bf4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp4pp/2pbbn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I'd been thinking about Nbd7 to chase away his knight but now I can't do it. I have to be careful of his knight moving. Right now my queen's protecting my bishop on d6 but if I put a knight on d7 then I have to watch for discovered attacks. Normally White likes to play Bf4 to get rid of Black's powerful bishop and it's a good move for Black to capture Bxf4 and force White to recapture with gxf4; that hurts White's kingside a lot. But I'm wondering if White will play Nd3 to enable him to recapture with the knight instead of the bishop.
446,17,9,1Ne4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp4pp/2pbb3/3pNp2/3PnB2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Ne4 is always a good move for Black in the Dutch.

He's threatening 12. Nxe4 fxe4; 13. Bxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned because the bishop on e6 is unguarded. I thought about playing Nxc3 here. That's a trap -- if he plays Qxb7 I'll play Nxe2+ and then Qb6 (and if he plays Qxa8 after that Nd7 traps his queen)."
448,17,11,1Qe7,b'rn3rk1/pp2q1pp/2pbb3/3pNp2/3PnB2/1QN3P1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 w - -',"This move protects both of my bishops and my pawn on b7. 
What I'm nervous about is that my queen is being used to guard two pieces and a pawn. I have to watch out for combinations against her being overworked.
Next I may play Na6 looking at Rc8 and c5 at some point."

It may be that he's anticipating my playing Na6 and looking at c5 and then he would want a rook on the d-file to be hitting the pawn on d5."

I looked for a while at how I might play g5 to chase off his bishop. The books I taught from showed lots of games where Black's surprisingly safe when playing g5 in the Dutch. I think it's because White's queen is on the queenside and diagonals to the king are blocked so White really can't take good advantage of the move. For Black it leads to f4 at some point and my queen and a rook and bishops and a knight are ready to attack his king if I can open it up a little. 
But for now I can't play g5 because he can trade knights first on e5 then take the pawn with the bishop. And if I take back with the queen he plays Qxb7. But I'm going to remember that move in case I can use it still coming up.

I can't trade on f4 because it makes his knight too powerful and I have to move my bishop to f7. That's not a bad square for it (it lets the bishop go over to h5 at the right time) but I'd rather not block my rook yet.
 
"
452,17,15,1Rab8,b'1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1pbb3/3p1p2/3PnB2/1QNN2P1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 w - -',"I looked at g5 again but I lose a pawn after. 13 … g5; 14. Nxe4 fxe4; 15. Bxd6 Qxd6; 16. Qxb7. 
 
I didn't find any real strong offensive moves so I chose a defensive move that stop the Qxb7 threat. Now g5 becomes an option -- though I have a feeling he's planning to trade my bishop on d6 and then put the knight back on e5 even. 
 
Sometimes it's good to ask which is your worst piece and then make plans to improve it. I don't like my knight on a6. It doesn't stop anything and I'm not sure it threatens anything -- unless I want to play c5. I have to look at that. It threatens c4. But if he trades pawns on c5 I'm not sure that helps me and my pawn in the center is isolated and weak. The other choices for my knight are b4 but that's not good. It chases his knight back to a better square (e5) it's easily chased away by a3 (and can only return to a6) and it's not even safe after White plays Bxd6 and removes one of its defenders. So that means that the knight is going to c7. But what can it do there unless I move my other bishop and let it go to e6.
 
I feel like I don't have any real weaknesses but I don't have a strong plan yet."
453,17,16,1e3,b'1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1pbb3/3p1p2/3PnB2/1QNNP1P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 b - -',That surprised me. I was certain he planned to trade my bishop and put his knight back on e5. I'm not sure what he's up to. This closes the position even more and makes my position even safer. His too.
454,17,17,1Bxf4,b'1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1p1b3/3p1p2/3Pnb2/1QNNP1P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 w - -',"So I decided to do what I'd rejected before. I'm going to trade the bishops. I'm sure he'll recapture with the knight and I'm kind of hoping even that he'll trade his knight for my other bishop. In closed positions like this knights generally have a big advantage over bishops. Notice that all of pawns on white squares make both of our light bishops pretty ineffective. His hope for an advantage might be to trade his knight for my bishop put his on h3 and then trade knights on e4. If I take back fxe4 suddenly his bishop would control an important line behind my pawns. 
 
 What I'm looking at is getting my knights to d6 and f6 (I'm guessing his other choice is to play f3 to chase mine off of its powerful post). Then if he plays Ne5 I'll be able to play Nf7 to challenge it.
 
That's a lot of knight moves but that's the big difference between open and closed game. This is a closed game; look how there aren't any open lines and the pawns block attempts to get to the other king. In closed positions knights are stronger because they can get past the roadblocks. Also attacks develop much more slowly. You don't have to be as concerned about rapidly developing attacks because the lines of attack just don't exist yet. In closed positions be willing to take your time to get your pieces to the best square; don't rush your attack."
455,17,18,1exf4,b'1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1p1b3/3p1p2/3PnP2/1QNN2P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 b - -',"That's a huge surprise to me. I felt that his knight would be very strong on f4. Maybe he was worried about me playing g5 but then he'd just go back to d3 and e5.
 
When your opponent surprises you think about what he's planning to do. He didn't just arbitrarily make a bad move; he has a plan in mind that I'll have to deal with. The sooner I can figure out what he's up to the better off I'll be.
 
I think he's telling me that he cleared out the e-file so he can post rooks on it and dominate it. If he puts a rook on e1 and plays f3 to chase away my knight he might be planning to put the rook on e5 and then the other one on e1. It'd be hard to withstand the pressure on my bishop.
 
I need to decide if I want to stay defensive and play Nc7 which would support that bishop. Or do I want to break open the other side with c5 while I have two knights and a queen supporting that move."

Either way I'm committed to being in a defensive position until he makes a mistake or breaks it open. What finally led me to Nc7 instead of Qd6 was in case he plays f3 I'm thinking that I might want to play Nd6.

Though it just occurred to me now that I've made the move that if he chase my knight to d6 and then plays Qa4 (I'll play Ra8) then Nxc6 to trade the knight for two pawns is uncomfortable for me."
457,17,20,Qe7,b'1r2r1k1/ppn1q1pp/2p1b3/3pNp2/3PnP2/1QN3P1/PP3PBP/3RR1K1 w - -',"I almost played Bf7 here which would've been a disaster. I was wondering if he would give up his strong knight for my last bishop - but then I saw that I lose a pawn after
   19. Bxe4   fxe4
   20. Nxe4
and my pawn on d5 is pinned and can't take it back.
 
Instead I'm just waiting to see what his plan is. But I'm playing Black against a higher-rated opponent so I don't mind if I can keep anything from happening and get a draw."
458,17,21,Na6,b'1r2r1k1/pp2q1pp/n1p1b3/3pNp2/N2PnP2/1Q4P1/PP3PBP/3RR1K1 w - -',"So do I really think he's planning to play Nc5?
If so he needs to get rid of my N on e4 first. Would he trade the B for it? That'd be unusual -- almost admitting that White's B is as weak as Black's B. I think it is in the Stonewall but that's not the common consensus. He might play f3 but that makes that bishop even weaker. Perhaps he's planning to redeploy it on f1. That would chase my N back to c7. It'd be surprising to see that B traded for either N but all of my queenside pawns become very vulnerable and weak if I let him trade on a6."
459,17,22,Nc7,b'1r2r1k1/ppn1q1pp/2p1b3/3pNp2/N2PnP2/1Q4P1/PP3P1P/3RRBK1 w - -',"No way I can let him take trade on a6. Sure I get a discovered attack with the queen but it's just going to go to c2 and my pawn on c6 becomes way too weak -- lots of pieces can attack it and there's no pawn that can protect it.
 
So after he plays f3 to chase my knight to d6 and he puts his knight on c5 I've got to figure out what I'll want to do.

562,22,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1...Nf6  The Alekhine Defense promising sharp tactics.

564,22,2,Nb4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/1n2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5...Nb4.  Probably 5...Ne7 is better since it does not induce the Q-side pawn push that W now conducts.  However 5...Ne7 would slow B's K-side assault later.  This Knight will develop into a major hindrance to B for much of this game.
565,22,3,b4,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/n2p1n2/3Pp3/1P2P3/P1N2N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq b3',7. b4.  At this point this game has exactly one game in the GK database as a comparison namely akre_pasa  v. gasparinov  from 2007.   So we are in relatively untested waters already.
566,22,4,Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/n2p1n2/3Pp3/1P2P3/P1N2b1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',9...Bxf3.  I would at least consider 9...Bg6 putting some heat on the base of W's central pawn chain.  Of course 10. Nd2 would then start the central assault and protect that base of the chain if W chooses that path.
567,22,5,c5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/n2p1n2/2pPp3/1P2P3/P1N1BB1P/2P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - c6',"12....c5.  Probably hoping for the en passant capture in order to free some space for B's King Bishop.  But W does not oblige and proceeds to cement the ""stonewall"" there."
568,22,6,1b5,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/n2p1n2/1PpPp3/4P3/P1N1BB1P/2P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"13. b5.  The ""stonewall"" construction commences on that flank!"
569,22,7,a5,b'r2q1rk1/1pn1bppp/3p1n2/pPpPp3/P3P3/2N1BB1P/2P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - a6',14...a5 Conceding to the stonewall as it can't be stopped anyway.    Note that as the game progresses the stonewall reduces B's chances except where he is best mobilized on the K-side and it does nothing to impede the power of W's bishops.
570,22,8,b6,b'r2q1rk1/2n1bppp/1p1p1n2/pPpPp3/P3P3/2N1B2P/2P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',15...b6.  B does not have the luxury of time to seal the stonewall.  It is probably best to play 15...Nd7 and if W takes the time for Na2 and c4 then B has a stronger attack on the base of the central pawn chain.
571,22,9,1Na2,b'r2q1rk1/2n1bppp/1p1p1n2/pPpPp3/P3P3/4B2P/N1P1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',16. Na2  I'm not sure what W was thinking here but I would look seriously at a properly timed f4 for example 16. Bd3 and then 17. f4.  The key is to support W's K-pawn long enough to threaten e5 when B's pieces are not well-coordinated to handle that.  
572,22,10,Ng3,b'r2q1rk1/2n1b1pp/1p1p4/pPpPpp2/P7/3QBPnP/N1P1B1P1/R4RK1 w - -',What would W do against 18....c4?  If 19. Qxc4 then 18...Nc5 gives the Knight an excellent outpost in the center and at the same time W's  Knight is out of action indefinitely.  In addition the threat ....e4 is looming.  Is that enough compensation for the Pawn?  And if W just exchanges his excellent Bishop to eliminate the Knight does that compensate W by blowing open the stonewall?  I am uncertain but I would certainly consider 18....c4.  
573,22,11,e4,b'r2q1rk1/2n1b1pp/1p1p4/pPpP1p2/P3p3/3QBPnP/N1P1B1P1/R3R1K1 w - -',19...e4.  Why not just 19...f4 20. Bf2 Qe8 and 21...Qh5?  Then ...Rf5 seems to bring some serious threats against the W K-side. 
574,22,12,Qxc3,b'r4rk1/2n3pp/1p1p4/pPpP4/P3Pp1b/2q2BnP/N1P2BP1/R3R1K1 w - -',23...Qxc3 Surely it is worth keeping the Queens on the board since the Queen is keeping B in the game.

576,22,14,2Be3,b'4nrk1/6pp/1p1p4/pPpPr3/P1P1P2b/4BBpP/6P1/R3R1K1 b - -',The exchanges have helped W to operate on some open lines for the Bishops and they are beginning to take command now.

Probably just forcing the trade of the B-squared Bishops with 28...Bg5 is best. 28...Bg5 also rids B of that useless Bishop of his. The Rook sac with 28...Rxf3 merely hastens the end. 
578,22,16,2Bf4,b'5rk1/6pp/1p1p1n2/pPpPr3/P1P1PB1b/5BpP/6P1/R3R1K1 b - -',29. Bf4.  The Bishops start to sweep the board.

582,22,20,g5,b'3r2k1/r6p/1p2Pn2/pPpP2p1/P1P2B1b/5BpP/6P1/R3R1K1 w - g6',33...g5  A colossally bad move but at least it has the advantage of being in a colossally bad position so it hastens the end.  I think only 33...Ne8 can marginally hold this position but for how long?  At least it has the advantage of freeing B's Bishop so that it is no longer just a tall Pawn guarding g3.   The Bishop can then march in and stop the Pawn surge with 34...Be7 by giving up the Pawn at g3.
583,22,21,3e7,b'3r4/r3P2p/1p1P1nk1/pPp1B1p1/P1P4b/5BpP/6P1/R3R1K1 b - -',36. e7  This Pawn roller is just gruesome to watch in action.  Its carnage is equivalent to the Terminator.

Quite honestly this was a twist for me. I am reminded of horrible experiences against the Grand Prix Attack in the Sicilian. I was also somewhat relieved when I remembered the difficulties White had in playing the King's Gambit.  "

The bonus prize here included the doubled pawns on the f-file which are easily stopped and an open g-file to the King. The pawns on f4 and e5 will be useful in restricting White's dark-squared Bishop's mobility.

I'm afraid it's one of those ones where you have to get the timing just right for things to work though. A lot of the openings are like that nowadays. Another opening I like for Black retorting 1. e4 is 1. ... d6 the Pirc defense often followed by 2. ... Nf6 3. ... g6 4. ... Bg7 5. ... 0-0. I like it because up to that point it's hard to make a mistake. But from then on things get more complex. That's why I'm sticking to Caro-Kann.
820,33,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Believe it or not some people actually play 2. c4 here instead. And it's actually a very formidable opening in my opinion. Leads to 2. ... d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. cxd5 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nxd5 6. Nf3 and White has a very good game. 2. c4 is called the anti-Caro-Kann defence and 2. ... d5 is called the anti-anti-Caro-Kann defence believe it or not! If you don't google it! Go ahead! Pretty ridiculous really. But I can see where they're coming from. Instead a better response to 3. exd5 is 3. ... Nf6 4. d4 cxd5 5. Nc3 g6 and Black has got a more playable game.

3. f3 is interesting as well to say the least. Leads to 3. ... e6 4. Be3 Nf6 5. e5 Nfd7 and White has a lot of space. Also Black's c8 Bishop is hemmed in. 3. f3 is the Tarkatower fantasy variation."

I guess it transposes later on but I usually expect something like 4. Bd3. But I reckon the best thing to do if you don't know the opening is to do what you'd usually do in the regular opening. If what he does doesn't hamper that of course.
