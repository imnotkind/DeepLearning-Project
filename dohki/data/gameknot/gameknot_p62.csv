1,0,1,b3,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4P3/1PN2N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This move is already off the database.
2,0,2,Nxf3+,b'r1bqr1k1/2pp1ppp/p2b4/1p1N4/3Qn3/1P3n2/PBP1BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',When I first saw this before I realized the white king was in check I thought Qxg7#.  It looked like a mistake.
3,0,3,Be5,b'r1bqr1k1/2pp1ppp/p7/1p1Nb3/3Qn3/1P3B2/PBP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Here at first I thought black was trading the knight for the bishop at b2.  At least the calamity Qxg7# was averted.
4,0,4,Bxh2+,b'r1bqr1k1/2pp1ppp/p7/1p1N4/4Q3/1P3B2/PBP2PPb/R4RK1 w - -',But black has much bigger plans--a bishop knight and rook for a pawn and queen.  Sweet!  Although it is a lot of material for a queen white's castle is demolished and his king exposed.  Well played!
5,0,5,Qh4+,b'r1b3k1/2pp1ppp/p7/1p1N4/4B2q/1P6/PBP2PPK/R4R2 w - -',It looks like a free bishop but it isn't.  I think Kf8 (which only appears to expose Ph7) would have worked great.  Qh4+ could be saved for another turn though white is almost certain to answer with Re1.
6,0,6,1Rfe1,b'r1b3k1/2pp1ppp/p7/1p1N4/4q3/1P6/PBP2PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Black must trade queen for rook.  Black's two extra pawns won't prove a match for white's knight.
7,0,7,1Nxc7,b'r5k1/1bNp1ppp/p7/1p6/8/1P6/PBP2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',Now black has one extra pawn.
8,0,8,2Re8+,b'2r1R1k1/1bNp1ppp/p7/1p6/8/1P6/PBP2PP1/6K1 b - -',White forces a rook trade.
9,0,9,f6,b'4N1k1/1b1p2pp/p4p2/1p6/8/1P6/PBP2PP1/6K1 w - -',Black defends Nxg7 or Bxg7.
10,0,10,h4+,b'8/3p2p1/p1bN1pk1/1p6/5P1p/1P4K1/PBP3P1/8 w - -',I like f5 better though black's position is weak.  White's king cannot move but h5 and f5 are invisible to white's black bishop.  Black is down two points and can ill afford trades.
11,0,11,Bf1,b'8/3p3k/p2N1p2/5Pp1/1pPB2K1/1P6/P7/5b2 w - -',Mm I like Kg7 better.  Yes white ends up with both the f6 & g5 pawns anyway with Ne8+ Kf7 Nxf6 followed by Kxg5.  But this way white's king sits on a square invisible to white's black bishop and white must negotiate a series of knight moves to force the king to move.  Plus black's bishop can still protect Pd7 which is preventing the promotion of white's c pawn.
12,0,12,Bxb3,b'8/3p3k/p2N4/5PK1/2P5/Bb6/8/8 w - -',Black trades two pawns for one.
13,0,13,Kf8,b'5k2/3p4/p2N1P2/2P3K1/8/Bb6/8/8 w - -',Mm I like Kg8 better I think.  White would respond with Kg6.  Black cannot promote either pawn but white can coronate the f pawn regardless.
14,0,14,3Nf5,b'5k2/3p4/p4P2/2P2NK1/8/Bb6/8/8 b - -',Now white pretty much must move Ke8 or white will move c6+ (discovered check by the bishop) Kd8...
15,0,15,Ka7,b'2Q5/k2K4/p7/B7/3N4/8/8/8 w - -',Black fights for a stalemate.  While the black king gets trampled by the knight--black never throws in the towel.  It was an admirable struggle well played.
16,0,16,5Nc6#,b'2Q5/k2K4/p1N5/B7/8/8/8/8 b - -',
17,1,0,Bc5,b'3r1rk1/ppq2pp1/4pn1p/2b4P/2PB4/5N2/PP2QPP1/1K1R3R w - -',Book to here. The position is given as +=/= for white which Houdini agrees with.
18,1,1,2Bxf6,b'3r1rk1/ppq2pp1/4pB1p/2b4P/2P5/5N2/PP2QPP1/1K1R3R b - -',A Novelty to me and not in any of my databases though it has probably been played before. I like this move of Les's as it puts us on our own resources and introduces an other imbalance into the position NvB. Houdini gives it -0.06.Usual is Bxc5 with about equal chances
19,1,2,2gxf6,b'3r1rk1/ppq2p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P5/5N2/PP2QPP1/1K1R3R w - -',White has the better pawn structure 3 pawn islands to 1 and a Q-side pawn majority. The h pawn may find itself a little exposed as the g pawn may become along the g file.White has two plans to consider . A K-side attack and a q-side advance in the endgame.
20,1,3,2g4,b'3r1rk1/ppq2p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K1R3R b - g3',Going for the King. Houdini gives this a -0.24 preferring 23.Nd2 maintaining the status quo.
21,1,4,2Rxd1+,b'5rk1/ppq2p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K1r3R w - -',Worried about the King black decides to simplify and exchange pieces. Houdini prefers 23....Qf4 -0.27.My move was its second choice at -0.25
22,1,5,Rd8,b'3r2k1/ppq2p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K1R4 w - -',Continuing to offer exchanges. Houdini prefers 24....Qf4 -0.18 over the move played 0.00.
23,1,6,2Rxd8+,b'3R2k1/ppq2p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K6 b - -',Best according to Houdini.
24,1,7,2Qxd8,b'3q2k1/pp3p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K6 w - -',"Time to take stock. With the exchange of a pair of major pieces the threat of a successful K-side attack has diminished. Houdini gives the position as dead equal or more precisely equal chances. Though white has 2 pawn islands to blacks 3 and a q-side pawn majority the exposed white k-side pawns makes it about level pawn wise. The imbalance of Bishop an Queen v.Knight an Queen is interesting. Capablanca's Theorem as espoused in Steve Mayer's book ""Bishop v Knight"" was that queen and knight are superior to queen and bishop in the endgame. Being that a queen and knight working smoothly together can create a greater number of threats than queen and bishop."
25,1,8,2Nh4,b'3q2k1/pp3p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3PN/8/PP2QP2/1K6 b - -',Trying to generate an attack on the king.Houdini and I preferred 26.Nd2 -0.00 compared to the game move -0.64
26,1,9,2Qd4,b'6k1/pp3p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2Pq2PN/8/PP2QP2/1K6 w - -',My plan here was to exchange queens as I mistakenly thought the bishop would be far superior in the minor piece and pawn ending. What both les and I both missed was the tactical shot 26......Bxf2 winning a pawn -0.64 compared to the played-0.36
27,1,10,Qf2,b'6k1/pp3p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3PN/5P2/PP2Qq2/1K6 w - -',Forcing the Q exchange and continuing with my plan. My move wasn't in Houdini's top 3 choices it preferred in descending order 27....Qg1  27.....f5 27......a5.However I still prefer my choice though 27....f5 looks interesting. Houdini considers the move I played an error changing the evaluation from -0.36 to =0.25 for white.
28,1,11,Kg7,b'8/pp3pk1/4pp1p/7P/2P3P1/5P2/PP3bN1/1K6 w - -',Moving the king closer to the action and planning to break up white's k-side pawns with f5.+0-22. Houdini also considers 29....f5 +0.22 and 29....kf8 +0.24
29,1,12,3Kc2,b'8/pp3pk1/4pp1p/7P/2P3P1/5P2/PPK2bN1/8 b - -',My preference was for 30.Nf4+0.26 but Les's move activating the king is as good +0.21
30,1,13,3f5,b'8/pp3pk1/4p2p/5p1P/2P3P1/5P2/PPK2bN1/8 w - -',Preparing a temporary pawn sac to break up whites k-side pawns. Houdini's 1st choice as well +0.21 30....Bg3 +0.25  30....b6 +0.29
31,1,14,3gxf5,b'8/pp3pk1/4p2p/5P1P/2P5/5P2/PPK2bN1/8 b - -',Best (+0.21 31.Nf4-0.11 31.b4 -0.11) otherwise black swaps pawns and gets rid of the double pawn for nil effort and k-side access to whites pawns with his king.
32,1,15,3Kf6,b'8/pp3p2/4pk1p/5P1P/2P5/5P2/PPK2bN1/8 w - -',Allowing a temporary pawn sacrifice but preventing N-f4-d5 +0.37. Houdini preferred 31....exf5 +0.21 which I didn't like because I thought 32.f4 would slow my k-side play down too much against whites soon to be mobile pawn majority.
33,1,16,3Kd1,b'8/pp6/4pk1p/7P/2P5/5P2/PP3bN1/3K4 b - -',Losing time and heading in the wrong direction +0.00.I thought 33.Kd3 was better +0.30 Houdini 33.Nf4 +0.43
34,1,17,Kxh5,b'8/pp6/4p2p/2P4k/8/5Pb1/PP2K1N1/8 w - -',At this point I mistakenly thought I had a win wrapped up. Passed K-side pawn superior minor piece. Houdini +0.01. A position which I shall p0st in a club forum and see if I can get master input.
35,1,18,3b4,b'8/pp6/4p2p/2P4k/1P6/5Pb1/P3K1N1/8 b - b3',Getting the Q-side majority rolling. -0.05. Houdini preferred 36.Ne3 Kg5 37.Nc4 Kf5 +0.00
36,1,19,3Bc7,b'8/ppb5/4p2p/2P4k/1P6/5P2/P3K1N1/8 w - -',Moving the bishop before white could play f4 cutting it of from the q-side +0.00. Houdini prefers 36.....Kg5 -0.07
37,1,20,3Ne3,b'8/ppb5/4p2p/2P4k/1P6/4NP2/P3K3/8 b - -',To help get the q-side pawns moving and planning to use the king to stop the h pawn -0.02
38,1,21,h5,b'8/ppb5/4p3/2P3kp/1PN5/5P2/P3K3/8 w - -',Getting my passed h pawn moving' Surely a win for black I thought. Houdini +0.00 obviously knew better.
39,1,22,3Kf2,b'8/ppb5/4p3/2P3kp/1PN5/5P2/P4K2/8 b - -',Houdini +0.00. I think I would have played 39.Nd6 +0.00.
40,1,23,3e5,b'8/ppb5/8/2P1p1kp/1PN5/5P2/P4K2/8 w - -',Worried about an impending Nd6 I played e5 to allow the K easy access to the d6 square +0.00
41,1,24,4a4,b'8/ppb5/8/2P1p1kp/PPN5/5P2/5K2/8 b - a3',Continuing the plan to get the Q-side pawns rolling -0.07. Houdini prefers 40.Ne3 +0.00  40.Nd2 -0.02 
42,1,25,4h4,b'8/ppb5/8/2P1p1k1/PPN4p/5P2/5K2/8 w - -',Houdini gives 40.......Kf5 as better -0.05 the move played +0.00
43,1,26,4Nd6,b'8/ppb5/3N4/2P1p1k1/PP5p/5P2/5K2/8 b - -',Played now this turns out to be an error -4.67 that was overlooked by both Les and myself. Houdini gives both 41.b5 +0.00 and 41.Ne3 +0.00 as maintaining equality.
44,1,27,Ke7,b'8/pp1Pk3/8/4p3/PP5p/5P2/5K2/8 w - -',Black incorrectly agreed a draw in this position due to the line 44.d8=Qch Kxd8 45.Kg2 Kd7  46.Kh3 Kd6 47.Kxh4 Kd5 48.Kg4 -0-75   45......b5 -8.85 wins easily. Back to some endgame training it's obviously needed.
45,2,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This defense is considered standard but is probably inferior.
46,2,1,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Nxd4?! is playable of course but perhaps stronger is 4. Qxd4!? with 4... Nc6 being answered by 5 Bb5 while after 4... Bd7 white can develop his Bc1 and then answer Nc6 naturally with Qd2. 
47,2,2,Qh4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP2q/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Qh4? is simply bad. There is a line in the Scotch game where Qh4 is played however but that is with extenuating circumstances.
48,2,3,c6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/3NP2q/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',It is now clear that Qh4 did nothing.
49,2,4,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nbpp1/2pp4/6Bp/3NP2P/2N3P1/PPP2PB1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Be7?? loses.
50,2,5,1Bxe7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1nBpp1/2pp4/7p/3NP2P/2N3P1/PPP2PB1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now Bxe7?? lets black back into the game. Instead 10. Nf5! threatening both g7 and d6 is winning: Bxg5 Nxd6+ Kf8 (Ke7 hxg5) hxg5 and now Qxg5?? loses a piece to Nxc8 (Rxc8 Qxd7).
51,2,6,1Qxe7,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1nqpp1/2pp4/7p/3NP2P/2N3P1/PPP2PB1/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Qxe7?? loses again! After Nxe7 black is holding for the moment although having lost his dark square bishop the d6 pawn may be in some trouble.
52,2,7,1Qd3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1nqpp1/2pp4/7p/3NP2P/2NQ2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Qd3?? lets black back into the game! Again Nf5 wins.
53,2,8,1Ne5,b'r1b1k1nr/pp2qpp1/2pp4/4n2p/3NP2P/2NQ2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Now the f5 square is guarded.
54,2,9,1Bf3,b'r3k1nr/pp2qpp1/2pp4/4n2p/3NP1bP/2N2BP1/PPP1QP2/R3K2R b KQkq -',Bf3?? drops a piece.
55,2,10,O-O-O,b'2kr2nr/pp2qpp1/2pp4/7p/4P1bP/2N2NP1/PPP1QP2/R3K2R w KQ -',0-0-0?? lets white back instead ... Qf6! is winning.
56,2,11,d5,b'4r1nr/ppk2pp1/2p2q2/3p3p/4P1bP/2NR1NP1/PPP2P2/2KQR3 w - -',Of course this invited complications. Perhaps black should have avoided it altogether. Of course it is also true that black did not defend at all in the game but it appears that even with reasonable play the reply exd5! may be strong.
57,2,12,1exd5,b'4r1nr/ppk2pp1/2p2q2/3P3p/6bP/2NR1NP1/PPP2P2/2KQR3 b - -',This appears sound although it should not have led to as large an advantage as it did in the game.
58,2,13,Kd7,b'6nr/pp1k1pp1/2pP1q2/7p/7P/2NR1bP1/PPP2P2/2K1Q3 w - -',This is the point where black might have wanted to pay attention. Clearly the maneuver Qe3-a7 is possible so black might have wanted to defend by 21 ... Kd8 22 Qe3 Bg4 23 Qxa7 Bc8. With two pawns already and a potential third on b7 following Ne4-c5 (or potentially Na4-c5/b6) white looks better but black could have continued playing.
59,2,14,2Rxd5,b'6nr/pp1k1pp1/3P1q2/3R3p/7P/4Q1P1/PPP2P2/2K5 b - -',Rxd5? is probably bad. Instead 24 Qxa7! seems to leave white with a winning position.
60,2,15,2Qe6,b'6nr/pp1k1pp1/3Pq3/3R3p/7P/4Q1P1/PPP2P2/2K5 w - -',Of course this loses. Black could have tried ... b6! perhaps?
61,2,16,2Qc5,b'6nr/pp1k1pp1/3Pq3/2QR3p/7P/6P1/PPP2P2/2K5 b - -',Now white is winning.

Un terrateniente cuyo nombre se ha perdido en los laberintos del tiempo tenía la particularidad de ser tan despiadado como buen jugador (al menos eso era lo que decía). Para castigar a los campesinos que trabajaban en su tierra y de paso divertirse los citaba y obligaba a jugar demostrando así su superioridad tanto económica como intelectual. Las sesiones eran humillantes y cada vez más frecuentes. Un día llegó al latifundio un forastero. Sin tener donde dormir encontró lugar entre la peonada que supo compartir su pobreza con el recién llegado. La alegría surgió cuando  el visitante agradecido por la hospitalidad prometió que vengaría el buen nombre de estas pobres personas en el propio juego del abusivo. Al día siguiente el retador se presentó en la mansión del noble quién encantado de encontrar un retador le dio las piezas blancas. Antes de empezar dijo nuestro jugador le confesaré que no solo estoy dispuesto a ganarle sino que me he impuesto una condición secreta que procederé a escribir.

It was discovered in 1916 by Szigmond Barasz a strong Hungarian master and gained (chess)world fame a few years later by featuring in two Black wins against Rubinstein regarded as possibly the strongest tournament player in the world at the time.

In February 1924 Hans Kmoch a famous theoretician and chess critic wrote this obituary on the defence:
""A counterattack that surfaced a few years ago and quickly faded away. The sacrifice of a pawn or piece for an advantageous position proved too much of a handicap for almost any player. Even for someone as gifted as Lasker who should find such a method ideal it unmasked itself as illogical inopportune and unfavorable.""

161,9,5,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/8/4P1p1/2P3n1/6B1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',This exposes the real point of the gambit: Black gains control of the powerful long diagonal and threatens the imminent recapture of the sacrificed pawn. The whole idea behind 2.e5 is not as could otherwise be supposed to quickly develop the bishop. But simply to break up White's pawn center and force him to defend the ensuing wreckage.
162,9,6,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/8/4P1p1/2P3n1/5NB1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Attacking with the h-pawn straight away would be premature: 6.h4 Nxe5 7.e3 g4 is quite ok for Black. On f3 the knight is well posted to take part in the action.
163,9,7,Nc6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n5/4P1p1/2P3n1/5NB1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',"A line first proposed by István Abonyi another strong Hungarian master who did significant work analyzing and promoting this opening.
On the face of it White's position isn't so good here: the e-pawn is doomed and with it much of his center influence and the bishop on g7 exerts a monstrous influence on the game. But if you take a closer look at Black's position there is cause for concern there as well. Primarily there is the question: where do I place the king longer-term? Will it be safe to castle short? Will I even be able to wait with castling until I can castle long? These are the undecided questions which will likely decide the fate of the game - unless White stumbles in the opening."
164,9,8,h4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n5/4P1p1/2P3nP/5NB1/PP2PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq h3',And this is the critical line. White attempts to spike Black's K-side initiative rob him of his space advantage there and get rid of the sheltering g-pawn. While Black is focused on gaining lines and influence in the center. The e-pawn is doomed but the fate of the g-pawn hangs in balance. While the g-pawn is alive Black will likely have the advantage. With the g-pawn gone he will have sacrificed his king-side structure along with the pawn; a much more dubious sacrifice in the longer term. Many players will thus prefer the more quiet long-term advantages of 4...Nc6 instead.
165,9,9,Bxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/8/4b1p1/2P4P/8/PP2PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',So far so good. Black has regained the sacrificed material has uncontested control of the long diagonal is ahead in development and has acute tactical threats. Against this weighs the irreparable damage to his kingside structure. As long as he can keep the initiative he will probably be fine. But how will White respond?
166,9,10,1Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/8/4b1p1/2P4P/8/PP1QPPP1/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',It is difficult to find an improvement for White here. On 10.Nc3 Black would likely capture the knight saddling White with an isolated doubled pawn. And of course the b2 pawn has to be protected or the Rook will fall after Bxb2.
167,9,11,1g4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/8/4b3/2P3pP/8/PP1QPPP1/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',The only move. Leaving the pawn on g5 or capturing the h-pawn leaves Black's K-side in shambles and virtually guarantees White good play. But with the g-pawn advanced like this Black keeps up the pressure against White's K-side while gaining valuable space.
168,9,12,1Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/8/4b3/2P3pP/2N5/PP1QPPP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',"Or 11.f4 Bg7 12.e4 d6 13.f5 Qe7 and Black has good play against White's weaknesses.
On 11.f3 Black would respond 11...Bg3+ 12.Kd1 d6 with advantage."
169,9,13,1Qf6,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/5q2/4b3/2P3pP/2N5/PP1QPPP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',"There are many good things to say about this move: it adds real strength to Black's pressure on the long diagonal it mobilizes a powerful piece and it summons the specter of direct threats against f2. Additionally it helps prepare Black castling long.
In contrast to this I rather misliked Black's position after 11...f5 12.e4 d6 13.Bd3 Qf6 as White has the powerful 14.Nb5! A theme also available to White after 11...d6 12.0-0-0 Qf6.
I did however for some time consider lines after 11...c6!?. But after 12.0-0-0 Qf6 13.Ne4 Qf5 14.Nd6+ Bxd6 15.Qxd6 Qe6 16.Qxe6 dxe6 Black is behind in development and will be lucky to claim equality."

I had expected 12.Nd5 with approximately equal play after 12...Qd6 13.f4 (unclear is 13.0-0-0!? c6 14.Nc3 Qxd2+ 15.Rxd2 Bxc3 16.bxc3 with eg. 16...b6 17.e4 Ba6 18.h5 0-0-0 and I think White may be slightly better) 13...gxf3 14.exf3 Bg3+ 15.Kd1 c6 16.Ne3 Qxd2+ 17.Kxd2 d6.

However it turns out to be surprisingly hard to take advantage of what ought to be a drastic weakening of White's kingside. The problem: White is ahead in piece development. Thus eg. 13.f3 Bf4 14.e3 Qe5 15.Ne4! and Black has nothing to show for his troubles as 15...Bxe3 16.Qxe3 f5 17.Bd3 fxe4 18.Bxe4 does not even give Black equality.
173,9,17,1gxf2+,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/5q2/4b3/2P1N2P/8/PP1QPpP1/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',I am rather proud of this little trick and I am pretty sure White had overlooked this. The queen is endangered but ... White has to react to the check and cannot take the queen. And meanwhile that intrepid little pawn is wreaking havoc on his structure!
174,9,18,Bxb2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2P4P/8/Pb1QPNP1/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',Netting Black a pawn. But the material is rather inconsequential here; what's important is Black's total control of the long diagonal - and the glaring weakness of c3 which White *has* to keep under guard in order to avoid all kinds of fatalities now.
175,9,19,Ba1,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2P4P/8/P1RQPNP1/b3KB1R w Kkq -',"An unreal - and amazingly strong - parking spot for the bishop!
Much worse is 15... Bd4 as 16.e3 forces the bishop away and winning White an important tempo.

176,9,20,1g3,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2P4P/6P1/P1RQPN2/b3KB1R b Kkq -',"I had expected 16.Ne4 after which 16...Qe5 17.Qe3 Bd4 18.Qf3 d5! (with the idea Bc8-f5) gives Black a clear advantage.
Nor do more quiet alternatives like 16.e4 or 16.Ng4 afford Black any problems. Eg.: 16.Ng4 Qe6 17.Qe3 d6 18.Qxe6+ Bxe6 with good play for Black.
The game move though it helps to develop the bishop turns out to be a dangerous weakening of White's king side. With the g-pawn advanced like this. White's King has no real safety anywhere on the board any more."
177,9,21,1d6,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1q2/8/2P4P/6P1/P1RQPN2/b3KB1R w Kkq -',I am not totally convinced this was best. But trying to fianchetto the bishop to b7 would do nothing but bring about an exchange so I reason that it has to get out this way. And also if b7 falls then the b-file will open and that could well prove very dangerous for White.
178,9,22,Bf5,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1q2/5b2/2P4P/6P1/P1RQPNB1/b3K2R w Kkq -',To be completely honest this move was partly a miscalculation. I had overlooked the real strength behind White's rather obvious reply to my 18th move: 19.Qd3! The problem: I have no real way of reinforcing the bishop which means I either have to retreat to f6 (wasting time and blocking the g-file) or capture on e4.
179,9,23,1Be4,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1q2/5b2/2P1B2P/6P1/P1RQPN2/b3K2R b Kkq -',"Before playing these moves I had taken a good long move on the critical alternative: 18.Bxb7 Rb8 19.Bc6+ Kd8 20.Be4. Black is a pawn down here but the open b-file is more than enough compensation: 20...Rb1+ 21.Rc1 Bc3! and White is lost.
It is worth noting that White cannot castle his way out of his current problems: 18.0-0 0-0-0 19.Ne4 Qd4+ and White has nothing to show for the pawn. Eg.: 20.Qxd4 Bxd4 21.Kh2 Bg6."

Less good is 19.Bxf5 Qxf5 20.Qe3+ Be5 and White's troubles are hardless less than in the game line.

The greedy 19.Bxb7 Rb7 20.Bc60 Kd8 still gives Black a mortally dangerous open b-file for a measly pawn and White has no real defence against it. Eg.: 21.Rc1 Bb2 22Rd1 Bc3 and White is lost. Or 21.Be4 Rb1+ and 22.Nd1 fails to the prosaic 22...Bxe4."

Personally I was more concerned about 20.h5?! where I needed to make sure White couldn't force a win with his h- and g-pawns. But Black turns out to be all right however after 20...Bxe4 21.Qxe4+ Be5 (21...Qe5 may be even better) 22.Qxh7 0-0-0 23.g4 Bg3 24.e3 Rxg4.

20.Bxg6 Qxg6 21.Qxg6 fxg6 leaves Black with a slight but clear advantage due White's pawn weaknesses.

I guess most of my advice ended up being for white.  Not my original intention.  But if you do this what is your opponent's best response?  It is wise to look at least one move ahead.

Bc5 shows some promise.  Black retains the knight but white could follow with Qd4.  White is down two pawns so trading is best avoided.  Maybe instead of Qd4 Pa4.  Trading pawns lets white attack black's c6 with rook and bishop.  Black saves the knight but the game lasts longer."

Un terrateniente cuyo nombre se ha perdido en los laberintos del tiempo tenía la particularidad de ser tan despiadado como buen jugador (al menos eso era lo que decía). Para castigar a los campesinos que trabajaban en su tierra y de paso divertirse los citaba y obligaba a jugar demostrando así su superioridad tanto económica como intelectual. Las sesiones eran humillantes y cada vez más frecuentes. Un día llegó al latifundio un forastero. Sin tener donde dormir encontró lugar entre la peonada que supo compartir su pobreza con el recién llegado. La alegría surgió cuando  el visitante agradecido por la hospitalidad prometió que vengaría el buen nombre de estas pobres personas en el propio juego del abusivo. Al día siguiente el retador se presentó en la mansión del noble quién encantado de encontrar un retador le dio las piezas blancas. Antes de empezar dijo nuestro jugador le confesaré que no solo estoy dispuesto a ganarle sino que me he impuesto una condición secreta que procederé a escribir.

KxB results in Nxf7+ (discovered check by the queen) and the black queen falls into darkness.  Well gets traded for the horse.  Of course if the king backs up the bishop is again in peril.

While this moves leaves the white knight undefended white can counter with a pawn fork.  White's castle pawns suffer and white doubles pawns but also attacks the d6 pawn.

Better yet is Na4 or Rd4.  20.  Qxg7 Nf7.  21. Qf6 Ng6 or black must defend the knight with a rook.  Or check white's king.

Usually after those moves I play 4d4 and open up the board.

671,31,8,exd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',White is now down 2 pawns. But he will not retake this pawn.
