1,0,1,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/3P4/2B5/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',white is weak but is trying to demolish my pawn/knight structure

5,0,5,Nxe3,b'r4rk1/1p1b1ppp/1q1pp3/1pb5/3NNP2/p3n3/P5PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',this move gives up my knight for a pulverized game.
6,0,6,2Qxf1,b'r4rk1/1p1b1ppp/1q1pp3/1pb5/3NNP2/p7/P5PP/1R3QK1 b - -',this LATE retreat invites black to follow up a series of unstoppable checks. White probably could have tried 20.Rd1 instead.
7,0,7,2Kh1,b'r4rk1/1p1b1ppp/1q1pp3/1p6/3bNP2/p7/P5PP/1R3Q1K b - -',White should have tried 21.Qf2 to stop this.

11,1,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Here is another annotation from me and the reason I annotated it is because of another mate (thanks to maestro and his pamphlets) on how to improve my game I sat down and planned out this mate from move 19 (yes thats only 6 moves ahead) but to me thats a significant improvement and I'd like you guys to see it
12,1,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/5p2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Here we see White in a slightly better position Black opening a white diagnoal on his King but White also doing the same for the Black Queen
13,1,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/p2pp1pp/1p3p2/2p5/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq e3',Taking control of the centre Nb3 d5 or Bf4 may have been better

15,1,4,d6,b'rn1qkbnr/pb2p1pp/1p1p1p2/2pP4/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Possibly opening up more squares for his LSB? I didnt see it as a real smart move stopping d6 maybe to stop opening up a line on his King? But d6 then causes Bxe4 which loses my momentum so that wasnt happening

I know g6 Nf4 leads to some serious problems leaving him with h7 but Bf5 g6 Bxg6 is the continuation I found then the King has g7 to move to and it looks a lot less bleak in my opinion...

The White Bishop cannot take for losing his Queen and although the Knight isnt doing much on d7 the Queen has to move (probably to c7) and the Rook has the Back line to play along and probably assist the Black Queen

Happy that I found it and more importantly that I was able to seize control of the game and not let it go. Compared to those that saw my previous annotation where there was a chance for White to take the Black bishop on h5 with my Queen but didnt and although I won it prolonged mate which was maybe 3 or 4 moves away...whereas this time I didnt let up or let it slip I was in control and played accordingly.

Comments appreciated!"
35,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I play e4 pretty much exclusively as it fits my style of play (aggressive attacking).  Certainly there are many good first moves for white.  Players of e4 must be prepared to face a very wide array of black responses including the standard e5 and it's ensuing variations as well as the Sicilian (tons of lines!) the French Scandinavian etc.
36,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',A very common response to 1. e4 leading to some of the most popular openings among GMs today including Petroff and Ruy Lopez to name two.
37,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Natural play developing and attacking the pawn.
38,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Again natural play.
39,2,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',More common moves are Nc3 and Bb5 (Ruy Lopez or Spanish).  I typically play Bc4 because it fits my aggressive playing style and can lead to many gambit lines.  I find opponents at my level are often less familiar with how to proceed facing this move than the other two.
40,2,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The natural move reaching the Two Knights Defense.
41,2,6,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',There are many available moves here such as Nc3 and d3 which are solid but a bit too stodgy for my personal style.  The move I played appears to lose a pawn but after Nxe4 black can not actual retain the pawn advantage.  White can play 5. Re1 or 5. Bd5 and regain the pawn in short order.  One of the reasons I play O-O is to give black the chance to play Bb5 a common move that leads to variations I enjoy playing (such as the Max Lange attack).  Other move options include 4. d4!? which is the original Max Lange gambit and of course 4. Ng5 for the the infamous Fried Liver Attack!  Perhaps Hurnavich would disagree but personally I think that the Fried Liver is a great opening for beginning and intermediate players to look at because it helps develop tactical thinking and an understanding of mating attacks.  One thing is sure you will face it sooner or later as black if you play the Two Knights!
42,2,7,Bd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Bp3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',The most direct move to regain the pawn.  Re1 also effective.
43,2,8,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Bp3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Retreating to f6 is the best move.
44,2,9,Bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/4p3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Bxc6 ensures that white will recoup the pawn.
45,2,10,dxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4p3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I have had opponents play bxc6 but I feel dxc6 is better.  It gives both the queen and the light-squared bishop more scope on the board.
46,2,11,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Nxe5 capturing the pawn.  Assessing this position I would have to say white has not accomplished anything significant from the opening.  White is not worse but certainly not better.  Perhaps the 4. Nc3 line suggested by Iansky is more promising.
47,2,12,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2pb1n2/4N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Definitely the strongest and most natural continuation.
48,2,13,d4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2pb1n2/4N3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',Defends the knight and allows for the development of the dark bishop.  Re1 would be premature as after BxN RxB white has a misplaced rook that will have to be moved again; meanwhile his other minor pieces are sitting on the back rank.
49,2,14,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1n2/4N3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Castling is certainly a reasonable move here.  BxN is playable but it is to black's advantage to hang on to the bishop pair.
50,2,15,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2pb1n2/4N1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Develops a piece and creates and pins the knight.  White is fantasizing about playing Qf3 and then Nd2 and Ne4.  Of course there are a lot of moves on black's part but that is the working plan.
51,2,16,Be7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2p2n2/4N1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',This move does break the pin but I prefer it's prior position on d6 eying the h2 square.  It does thwart the plan of Qf3 etc for white.  I think better would have been to continue development with Be6 or to challenge the bishop with h6.
52,2,17,1Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2p2n2/4N1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White develops his last piece putting pressure on d5 and e4.  White will be looking next to centralize the queen with a move such as Qd3 followed by bringing the rooks to the central files.
53,2,18,Be6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2p1bn1p/4N3/3P3B/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Good move completing development and placing the bishop on an active square.
54,2,19,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2p1bn1p/4N3/3P3B/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Centralizing the queen and connecting the rooks.
55,2,20,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2p1b2p/3nN3/3P3B/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Places knight on a good post but does give white the option of eliminating black's bishop pair.  It's hard to suggest a significantly better move.  Perhaps Re1 placing the rook on an open file (no pawns).
56,2,21,Nxe7,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1npp1/2p1b2p/4N3/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I think capturing with the queen would be better as this retreats the knight to a less active square.  Also capturing with the queen would connect the rook and get the queen out of the way to bring them into the center as needed.
57,2,22,Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p1b2p/3nN3/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Knight returns to it's better post.  I think this is the best move but it emphasizes black's loss of time in capturing with the N on the previous move.
58,2,23,1Ne4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p1b2p/3nN3/3PN3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White is not anxious to trade down pieces further since that would lead fairly quickly to a drawn position.  This move puts the N on a very active central square and moves it closer to the enemy king.
59,2,24,Bxe4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p4p/3nN3/3Pb3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black elects to trade down further which is probably fine.  Black will have to be careful that white does not mount too much pressure on his king-side however.
60,2,25,Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p2n1p/4N3/3PR3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',This move attacks the R and brings a piece closer to the king to aid in defense.  Just to note that this knight has now made a circuit from f6-d5-e7-d5-f6.  That is a lot of moves for one piece and as a result black still has queen and rook in starting position while white has queen and rook active.
61,2,26,1Rh4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3R/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Threatening Rxh6 and generally threatening mayhem on black's king-side.  White has to keep in mind the black queen x-raying the rook through the black night but there is no danger in that regard at present. 
62,2,27,1Kh7,b'r2q1r2/ppp2ppk/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3R/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',The best and I think only good move to deal with Rh4.
63,2,28,1Re1,b'r2q1r2/ppp2ppk/2p2n1p/4N3/3P3R/6Q1/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Activating the final piece in white's arsenal.  White will be looking to increase pressure on black's king.
64,2,29,1g5,b'r2q1r2/ppp2p1k/2p2n1p/4N1p1/3P3R/6Q1/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - g6',While a move like this is tempting to pressure the rook it doesn't turn out well for black.  Black had a fairly safe king-side structure prior to this move and dramatic pawn moves in front of the king should only be made with very careful consideration.  In this case the problem for black is that the pawn on h6 is pinned by white's rook so although the pawn advanced to g5 appears to be guarded it in fact is not.  Black needed to look for ways to get his queen and a8 rook into the game.
65,2,30,2Qxg5,b'r2q1r2/ppp2p1k/2p2n1p/4N1Q1/3P3R/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Serious trouble now for black with white threatening Rxh6# next move.
66,2,31,Qf6,b'r5nk/ppp2Q2/2p2q1p/8/3P2R1/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 w - -',Qf8 would have held temporarily.
67,2,32,2Rxg8+,b'r5Rk/ppp2Q2/2p2q1p/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/4R1K1 b - -',Removing the defender of the queen with check.  Removing the defender of a piece is always worth investigating.  In this case the result is crushing.
68,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Tartakower plays aggressively using the From Gambit.

163,7,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',Okay we're starting with a Kings Gambit.  So white wants a swashbuckling good time and he's willing to give black a slight advantage for it.  At this level of play this opening is quite a good choice.
164,7,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',In doing this you are a move ahead in the exact same attack.  You have the same weakness Q check with a pawn on the f file to create complications.  Accepting the pawn would have had white trade the weakness for his initiative but you have effectively equaled the weaknesses and given him even more initiative. 
165,7,2,exf5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Here the mirroring had to stop if just from a tactical standpoint.  Qh5 is coming and it's not going to be pretty.  This is time for one of those really uncomfortable lines.  3...Qe7 4.Qh5+ Kd8 your king is going to have to move either way.  It's better to put him in the best square.  lets look at the alternative  
166,7,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp3p/5nP1/7Q/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',White choose to play a swashbuckling game but forgot his sword.  Black should have played Qe7+ then Kd8 again getting his king out of dodge before allowing the true power of whites attack to come to fruit.  He has lost some pawns by not doing it sooner but their is still time.  5.Nf6?? it appears both players missed the tactic.  6.g7+ 7.Nxh5 8.g7xh8Q and white trades a pawn for a rook.
167,7,4,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppq2p/5nP1/4Q3/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',What about 7d4? instead of whats next. No need to trade just yet.  But okay white traded queens.
168,7,5,Bxe7,b'rnb1k2r/ppppb2p/5nP1/8/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Look at the difference if white had already moved d4.  Note that in capturing f4 you also still have an attack on c7 if black is to capture.  Not suggesting capturing or not just saying the oppourtunity is there rather than this position.  In between moves can give you tiny advantages like that.  
169,7,6,h5,b'rnb1k2r/ppppb3/5nP1/7p/5p2/3B4/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq h6',Again I like 8...hxg6 getting rid of that pesky pawn and opening things up a little bit for the rook on h8 whether it be on the h g or f file.  9.Bxg6 9...Kd8.  Anyways now black has a pesky pawn to deal with he has given up the option of taking it with a pawn and so no white can keep it there.  
170,7,7,Nf3,b'rnb1k2r/ppppb3/5nP1/7p/5p2/3B1N2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',What about Ne2 attacking the pawn?  Get black to start tying up his pieces to defend his isolated pawn.  Lets count how many moves he spends on this knight.
171,7,8,1Ne5,b'rnb1k2r/ppp1b3/5nP1/3pN2p/5p2/3B4/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I see white has a problem with bringing only one soldier to the war at a time.  Maybe 10.0-0 and you have a rook to help matters.  That's two moves for that knight
172,7,9,1Nc3,b'rn2k2r/ppp1b3/4bnP1/3pN2p/5p2/2NB4/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',11...Nbd7 working on getting those rooks connected and your king off to the other side of the board seems just slightly better.  However pushing that knight back and showing white how much time they wasted is very tempting too.  However I favor bringing a new piece in that trades off rather than moving an old one twice to push a piece back especially since now the knight is eyeing g5.
173,7,10,1Nf3,b'rn2k2r/ppp5/3bbnP1/3p3p/5p2/2NB1N2/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',3 moves for that knight
174,7,11,1Nc6,b'r3k2r/ppp5/2nbbnP1/3p3p/5p2/2NB1N2/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Maybe 12.Bd7 first stoping the knight checks the bishop and then forking the rook and bishop mess where black loses his bishop pair and doubles isolated pawns giving him four islands of isolated pawns.
175,7,12,1O-O,b'r3k2r/ppp5/2nbbnP1/3p3p/5p2/2NB1N2/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',But white has no interest in taking advantage of positional weaknesses.  Now he decides to castle.

More promising options would be c3 aiming for either b4 or d4 castling to leave options open or h3 preventing White's next move."
306,14,4,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P1bB/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',The game is now almost entirely symmetrical. Often symmetry works out poorly for Black who is behind by a half-move but in a position as locked up as this one it will be hard for White to make any play without taking some risks.
307,14,5,Nd5,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2bNp2b/2B1P2B/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',This is an excellent square for the Knight and it takes advantage of the annoying pin on Black's f6-Knight.

309,14,7,1Nxf6+,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/3p1N1p/2b1p2b/2BnP2B/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White strikes first.

White has inflicted a weakness on the Kingside and has gained space there as well. On the other hand the Kingside will no longer be a safe space for the White King so White needs to put some serious thought into the King's future. In the actual game White delayed figuring out the King's situation so long that it became a real problem.
311,14,9,1c3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2p2/3p1pbp/2b1p3/2BnP1PB/2PP1N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQkq -',"!? On one hand this move is admirable for how it restricts Black's pieces and kicks the Black Knight out of d4. On the other hand it leaves behind some problems for White: 1) the Knight was the only White piece who could really take advantage of all those nice squares on the Kingside (f5 h5) and in the center (e3 d5) and 2) White will probably want to castle Queenside so this weakens the King's future home. 
A different plan would be to play Bg3 so that either Black plays Nxf3+ of his own volition or you get to play Nh4 threatening both Nxg6 and Nf5."
312,14,10,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2p2/2np1pbp/2b1p3/2B1P1PB/2PP1N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R w KQkq -',?! Now that White has committed to c3 in order to restrict this Knight Black should have traded it off.
313,14,11,1d4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2p2/2np1pbp/2b1p3/2BPP1PB/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQkq -',? Ooooh.... yes this move is a very worthwhile goal. But the White pieces just aren't ready for it. The Queen needs to develop the King needs to castle and there needs to be adequate support for both center pawns. As it is this move just loses a pawn and hands Black the initiative.
314,14,12,1Qb3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2p2/1bnp1pbp/8/2BPP1PB/1Q3N1P/PP3P2/R3K2R b KQkq -',"? Wishful thinking. Now BOTH center pawns hang. 
Defending the e-pawn with say d5 and Bd3 (Bd3 right away loses the d-pawn) should have been the priority. "
315,14,13,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2p2/1bnp1pbp/8/2BPP1PB/1Q3N1P/PP3P2/R3K2R w KQ -',! Cool calm and collected. Black takes a move to secure his King knowing that White cannot defend his center pawns.
316,14,14,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2p2/1bnp1pbp/8/2BPP1PB/1Q5P/PP1N1P2/R3K2R b KQ -',? Undefends one pawn to defend another. 0-0-0 would have been better. d5? would have been met by ...Na5.
317,14,15,c5,b'r2q1rk1/pp3p2/1b1p1pbp/2p5/2BnP1PB/2Q4P/PP1N1P2/R3K2R w KQ c6',"?
At this point during the next few moves we see a familiar pattern: One player makes a mistake then the other player after taking a big advantage doesn't know what to do with it and drifts aimlessly. Meanwhile the first player (White here) newly motivated by his/her mistake plays with renewed focus and gradually takes over the initiative."

319,14,17,2Rxd4,b'4rr2/p3qpk1/3p2b1/1ppB2Pp/3RP3/4Q2P/PP3B2/3K3R b - -',?! Courageously giving up more material to eliminate Black's best piece. But it would have been much better to play Qc3 and then Bxd4+ trading a Bishop for the Knight instead of giving up a Rook for it.
320,14,18,2Re1,b'4rrk1/p3qp2/3p2b1/1p1B2Pp/3QP3/7P/PP3B2/3KR3 b - -',! Good using all of the pieces.
321,14,19,2Qxg5,b'4rrk1/p4p2/3p2b1/1p1B2qp/3QP3/7P/PP3B2/3KR3 w - -',Black should not go grabbing pawns in front of his King right now. Instead he should focus on using the material he already has to take the fight to the insecure White King which is stuck in the center  – …Rc8 or …Qc7 come to mind.
322,14,20,3Qxa7,b'4rrk1/Q4p2/3p2bq/1p1B3p/4P3/7P/PP3B2/3K2R1 b - -',? Ditto for White – this is not the time to go grabbing wing pawns. White is too far behind in material to be able to make up for it with this kind of Queen sortie. All this does is a) open lines to the White King after …Ra8 and b) take the Queen out of the action. Instead moves like Qf6 or Qg3 – attacking the Bishop (notice that the f7-pawn is pinned?) and freeing d4 for the White Bishop – should have been under consideration.
323,14,21,3Rec8,b'2r2rk1/Q4p2/3p2bq/1p1B3p/4P3/7P/PP3B2/3K2R1 w - -',? Missing White's next – forcing it in fact. Black should have noticed how short of squares his Queen was. Now was the time to free the Queen with …Qf4.
324,14,22,3Be3,b'2r2rk1/Q4p2/3p2bq/1p1B3p/4P3/4B2P/PP6/3K2R1 b - -',! An excellent idea which forces a major concession from Black (hiding the Queen away on h7) if he wants to avoid a draw by repetition. 
325,14,23,3Bd4,b'2r2rk1/Q4pq1/3p2b1/1p1B3p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 b - -',The Black Queen cannot avoid harassment without completely removing herself from the action.
326,14,24,3Qh7,b'2r2rk1/Q4p1q/3p2b1/1p1B3p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 w - -',Taking the repetition with …Qh6 would have been hard to do in view of Black's being up the Exchange (i.e. Rook for Bishop) but it would have avoided the loss. White's pieces are now too active compared to Black's and Black needed to get real about his chances.
327,14,25,3Qb7,b'2r2rk1/1Q3p1q/3p2b1/1p1B3p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 b - -',Another consequence of Qxa7? is that the Queen and Bishop now get in each other's way. Still instead of this little step the Queen should have gone all the way to e7 threatening to move to f6 next turn at which point Black would be completely tied up.
328,14,26,3Qh6,b'2r2rk1/1Q3p2/3p2bq/1p1B3p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 w - -',? Thinking to take advantage of the fact that Be3 is no longer an option but it gives White the opportunity to play…
329,14,27,3Bxf7+,b'2r2rk1/1Q3B2/3p2bq/1p5p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 b - -',!! This move! An excellent combination not at all easy to see – especially with your clock ticking down. It is very impressive that White despite the time pressure and the psychological effect of being behind for so long was able to spot this tactic. The Bishop on g6 is pinned and the Rook on f8 is overloaded. (i.e. it's trying to guard too many pieces at once.)
330,14,28,3Qxc8+,b'2Q3k1/5r2/3p2bq/1p5p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 b - -',White is only up one pawn for now but he has not given up any of his piece activity and his position is crushing. Black now decides to end things quickly.
331,14,29,3Kh7,b'2Q5/5r1k/3p2bq/1p5p/3BP3/7P/PP6/3K2R1 w - -',"?? …Rf8 would have held out longer of course. Then 37. Qe6+ Kh7 38. Qxd6 (threatening 39. Rxg6 Qxg6 40. Qxf8 among other things) would have kept White firmly on the path to a quick victory.
As it is White does not miss this chance to end things quickly and cleanly before any more mistakes can happen on either side.

344,15,11,Qxe5,b'r4rk1/pppb1pp1/7p/3Pq3/2B2PPP/2P1P3/P7/R3K2R w KQ -',Black decides to make the Queen exchange and now for a new gameplan

358,15,25,2Re7,b'8/p1pRrkp1/1p5p/7P/8/r1P1P3/P3K3/2R5 w - -',Another mistake by me in not seeing this in my analyis had I have seen this i probably wouldnt have chosen it. Other than Rd2 (which puts me in the defensive again) I have no choise but to go down another pawn..

368,15,35,3Rc4,b'8/p1p5/1p2krpp/7P/2R3K1/2P5/8/8 b - -',In my position as black I would have played firstly gxh4 to which I was white would have played Kxh4 or secondly c5. I can see Blacks idea that g5 plays to Blacks advantage in Rf4+ and White will lose without his Rook so he isnt going to stick around to see Rf4+ happen and therefore take himself off the line and out of the game almost (this is where i said having the pawn on h5 instead of h4 would be better) but if the pawn was on h4 then 38...g5 39. hxg4 hxg4 40. Kxg4 and maybe it was better after all but oh well
369,15,36,a5,b'8/2R5/1p2kr1p/p5pP/6K1/2P5/8/8 w - a6',Dont see why Black didnt choose to play Rf4+ here instead of 40...Rf4+ Black could have checked the King forced him to move then played a5 if he wanted to. Anyway

373,15,40,4Rh7,b'8/7R/1p1k3p/p5pP/2P2r2/7K/8/8 b - -',Black cant defend that pawn now so into check goes the White King

378,15,45,Rf8,b'5r2/7R/1p1k2Kp/p5p1/2P5/8/8/8 w - -',Cannot say why Rf8 was played in my opinion Rh4 would have worked just as well the h pawn is covering the g pawn from being captured and that would leave the Black King alone with two pawns against the lone c pawn
379,15,46,4Rxh6,b'5r2/8/1p1k2KR/p5p1/2P5/8/8/8 b - -',Rook captures back a pawn and Black isnt playing fantastic here could have close the game out a long time ago. Kc5 should have been played long before as it stands though the Rook now cant defend it so now is a good a time as any for Black
380,15,47,4Kxg5,b'5r2/8/1p5R/p1k3K1/2P5/8/8/8 b - -',And now the margin is just one point in material Rf8 completely removed the Rook from any defense it had and gave away the two pawns and the game is in the balance. Here Rc8 is played but I think b5 would have been better played first..
381,15,48,5cxb5,b'2r5/8/7R/pPk5/5K2/8/8/8 b - -',Might as well take it doesnt look like having a bright future anyway
382,15,49,5Rh5+,b'2r5/8/8/pk5R/5K2/8/8/8 b - -',A smart move for White but I expected Black to play Rc5. Although has managed to somehow redice the 3 pawn deficit to just one removing the Rooks would still leave the advantage to Black and with the Black king blocking the White King from the a pawns path all would be lost for White..
383,15,50,5Rb5+,b'2r5/8/8/1R6/p7/1k1K4/8/8 b - -',White finally breaks through after bringing his King down as close as Black will let him and I thought here I had a chance?
384,15,51,5Ra5,b'2r5/8/8/R7/p7/3K4/k7/8 b - -',Not sure if this was the right move at the time. I now see Rb4 followed by Rc4 could have forced Rxc4 Kxc4 but then the White King is still blocked and that of course would only play out if Rb3 didnt result in Black playing a3 and leaving the situation still hopeless for white with 55. Rb4 Ka3 56. Rc3 Kb3 which gives the pawn right of passage there...so Ra5 probably was the best move..
385,15,52,5Ra6,b'2r5/8/R7/8/8/pk1K4/8/8 b - -',I dont think White can win but maybe he might make a mistake..
386,15,53,5Rb6+,b'8/8/1R6/8/8/p1r5/1k1K4/8 b - -',White looks for something anything..
387,15,54,5Rb3,b'8/8/1R6/8/8/pr6/1k1K4/8 w - -',I deliberated here for a long time...if Rc6 was played there may be a chance (depending on black) of White making Rc2 in which case if Black didnt play Rc3 after white plays Rc6 then maybe he'd have a chance. For a long time now though White has been waiting for Black to give him an oppertunity and doesnt give him one. Going through the lines after the game Black could obviously still have won even if White gets his rook to Rc2 by something like 60. Rc6 Rb4 61. Rc2 Kb3 62. Kc1 and the Black King to open his rook up can only move to a4. This allows the White Rook to move to a2 and perhaps force a draw but that is all only by playing Blacks moves for him. As it was I was overthinking and I played probably the worst move i could
388,15,55,6Rxb3+,b'8/8/8/8/8/pR6/1k1K4/8 b - -',Which was this one...Rxb3
389,15,56,6Kxb3,b'8/8/8/8/8/pk6/3K4/8 w - -',Exchange
390,15,57,a2,b'8/8/8/8/8/1k6/p7/2K5 w - -',"Pawn advance...I resigned here because after he earns a Queen or rather well and truly before this point I had lost..

Please comment and give me advice I didnt play to play I got caught up in captures and the like and tried to fight my way back but was perhaps not wary enough of how important pawns can be in the endgame. Thanks everyone

However it is a mistake for a few reasons.  First it does not develop a piece.  Remember it is paramount to develop the minor pieces as quickly as possible in the opening.  Second it is best not to move a piece (or pawn) twice in the opening unless there is a compelling reason.  Third after 5. exd5 black will simply lose this pawn.  Much better would have been 4. ...

It should be noted that doubled f pawns are not necessarily a weakness and are often preferred by players such as Nigel Short.  One advantage for white would be the possibility of putting a rook on the half-open g file applying pressure towards the black king.  However the doubled f pawns can make the white king vulnerable (not everyone is as expert at defending as Nigel Short including me!) so I have captured with the knight.

The timing of if and when to create space for your king can be a tricky thing.  Too early and you can neglect development giving your opponent the edge.

Perhaps better would have been Nc5 after which black will have the option of capturing the light-squared bishop ( if 13. ... Nc5 Bc4 then b5 forces bishop back ).
422,17,23,1c4,b'r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/pn3n2/3Pp2b/2P5/1B1P1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - c3',This move solidifies the d5 pawn which up to this point has been fairly weak and a good target for black.  It also creates a space for the white queen to step out from behind the pin to c2.
423,17,24,1Qd6,b'r3r1k1/1pp2ppp/pn1q1n2/3Pp2b/2P5/1B1P1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',At this stage of the game moving the queen to a more central position and connecting the rooks is a very good thought.  You must take care though not to place the queen in a position where it can be attacked by minor pieces.  In this case white can play Ne4 next if he chooses with the option of further trading down pieces.  White's plan has been to step out of the pin to c2 and we see now that he can do this with tempo as it threatens c5 next forking the knight and queen.  ( For any following we just discovered Paul was unaware of the annotation feature and has been playing without the benefit of my comments).

Evalutation conclusion: Black has a better position based upon his greater piece and pawn moblity and presence of a direct threat. However the knight on e5 can not be easly attacked but needs preparation to execute. Whites knight is more secure on d4 and both players have development problems for their remaining bishops. In the end white has to play c3 in order to avoid serious pawn weaknesses. "

My thought was when I went into these moves the worst I should come up is a point down in material but I would have hopefully minimized Black's K-side pressure.
512,20,25,2Nxf3,b'r1b2rk1/p1p4p/P6q/1P3pnn/2PBp3/4PNP1/4Q1BP/R4RK1 b - -',It didn't matter to me which pawn g or e that Black retook with I was taking back with my N.

514,20,27,2Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/p1p4p/P6q/1P3p1n/2PBn3/4PRP1/4Q1BP/R5K1 w - -',But Black sees all of this and thus White is down one material point.

522,20,35,3gxf5,b'r4r2/p5kp/P3b1q1/1Pp2P2/2P1nR2/4P3/4Q1BP/5R1K b - -',I was quite pleased with this move and what came next.  I could not see how Black could refuse to respond 31...Bxf5.  At this point His N is en prise so moving Qh6 would only lose the N (White would have to take the N because otherwise 32. fxe6??  Ng3+ and it's game over.)

524,20,37,3Rae8,b'4rr2/p5kp/P5q1/1Pp2b2/2P1nR2/4P3/4Q1BP/6RK w - -',Black sees this as well and it's time to exchange off a bunch of pieces.
525,20,38,hxg6,b'5r2/p5k1/P5p1/1Pp5/2P1r3/4P3/4Q2P/7K w - -',And now it's a Q v 2 Rooks.  I figured with my Q-side pawn advance I should be able to obtain at least a draw.
526,20,39,3Kg2,b'5r2/p5k1/P5p1/1Pp5/2P1r3/4P3/4Q1KP/8 b - -',My first thought is to bring my K into the action.  I had two hopes at this point:  exchange my Q for the Rooks or find a way to take a7.

529,20,42,Re6e5,b'4r3/p5k1/P5p1/1Pp1r3/2P5/3QPK2/7P/8 w - -',Here it seems to me that Black is playing for a draw.
530,20,43,3h4,b'4r3/p5k1/P5p1/1Pp1r3/2P4P/3QPK2/8/8 b - h3',My thought was to prevent g5 from pushing forward and creating complication.

532,20,45,Kf7,b'8/p3rk2/P5p1/1Pp1r3/2P1PK1P/3Q4/8/8 w - -',Time for another long think.  I could not come up with a variation where I could get my Q to take a7 and I began to seriously consider that this game was drawn.  I was in a similar game about a week or so before this and did not consider pushing my pawns.  I took a draw in that game when analysis showed I had a win.  Therefore...
533,20,46,4b6,b'8/p3rk2/PP4p1/2p1r3/2P1PK1P/3Q4/8/8 b - -',I found this move!  There are a variety of variations but with correct play at best Black was going to lose a rook.
534,20,47,Rxa7,b'8/r4k2/1p4p1/2p5/2P1QK1P/8/8/8 w - -',And now with careful play White should win.
535,20,48,4Qc6,b'8/r4k2/1pQ3p1/2p5/2P2K1P/8/8/8 b - -',This removes b6
536,20,49,4Qe6,b'8/6k1/4Q1p1/2p2r2/2P3KP/8/8/8 b - -',My thought was to slowly squeeze the King.  I was thinking that once I got rid of g6 I'd exchange Q for R and either h4 or c4 would Queen.
537,20,50,5Qxg6,b'7k/8/6Q1/2p4r/2P3KP/8/8/8 b - -',All according to plan...
538,20,51,5Rxh4+,b'7k/8/6Q1/2p5/2P3Kr/8/8/8 w - -',And Black lays a trap.  If Kxh4 the game is a draw--stalemate.
539,20,52,5Kf4,b'7k/8/6Q1/2p5/2P2K2/7r/8/8 b - -',And Black resigns.  My thanks to my opponent and his after-game comments.  Any comments suggestions or criticisms are most welcome and appreciated.

Here again Operation Joblock has become my Expert opponents' chief nemesis.  It has sentenced about 10 out of 13 of such opponents to many hours of head scratching teeth gnashing (so much so they may well need a visit to my buddy The Dentist ere long!) before they either hit the offer draw button or click on the yes button in response to my draw offer or in the case of the Master Mater he decided to try and sac material before he in turn ended up allowing a draw by repetition.  This MT starts off with the Mason Variation of the Queen Pawn Opening which is 1.d4 d5 and 2. Bf4.  My opponent decided to develop a piece with 2. ..... Nf6.

Qc1 - I certainly do feel that there is gonna be a major piece stouche on the a and b columns so Glenda moves to c1 to protect the b2 pawn (hence her sobriquet Glenda The Defender!) and to ensure that black will not be able to take control of either the open a and b columns when the a and b pawns are traded off.

This will be of some significance a few moves on.  Please note that black has all bar one of his pawns on the same colour square as his bishop.  These pawns will hem him in haha!

Black tries to contest the b column by moving the Wicked Witch of the West onto that file.  But never fear my stalwart defender Glenda has this all sussed and covered.  Her better half Henry edges towards the centre.  I intend a move such as g3 and moving Henry to g2.  This solidifies my position making it very hard to break down.  From a seemingly open position that Joblock strikes again!  On moving Henry to f1 I decided to offer a draw here.  Gameknot Analysis showed the position to be slightly in favour of black so it was a good draw offer netting me a handy 6 rating points keeping my rating in the high 1700s.  Hope you have had a nice weekend all of you and a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

My memory of the detailed lines is vague but I've usually followed a policy of alternating pawn and minor piece moves over the next few moves which hasn't served me particularly well.  In this game I concentrated on developing my pieces before launching too many pawns.

White's king is also more exposed that Black's but White's pieces are better poised to attack so it's still a double-edged position.
703,31,14,2Ne2,b'6k1/1pq1n1p1/p4r1p/3p1P1P/6Q1/P2P4/1P2N3/5RK1 b - -',?! I felt afterwards that this was an error because it allowed Black's Q in to my position.  26. d4 would have prevented this but would have also prevented my N from using the d4 square.
704,31,15,g5,b'6k1/1p2nr2/p4P1p/3p2pP/3N2Q1/P2q4/1P5K/6R1 w - g6',I had to think long and hard about whether to take en passant but eventually decided that a knight in the box was better value.

706,31,17,3Rf1,b'8/1p3k2/p3r2p/3p1NpP/8/P7/1P5K/5R2 b - -',Black has two pawns for the knight so it is still not an easy win.  White seeks to exploit the knight's capacity for trickery by threatening a double check.
707,31,18,3Kg8,b'6k1/1p6/p3r2p/3p1NpP/8/P7/1P5K/5R2 w - -',which Black sidesteps.
708,31,19,Re2,b'6k1/8/p6p/1p1p1NpP/8/P5K1/1P2r3/3R4 w - -',Now it's a question who can snaffle most pawns...
709,31,20,3Rd3,b'6k1/8/p6p/1p3NpP/8/P2R2K1/1r6/8 b - -',I erred on the side of caution bearing in mind that Black's next move would have forked K and a-pawn.  Not sure whether I could have grabbed the h6 pawn at this point.
710,31,21,Rb6,b'6k1/8/pr5p/5NpP/8/R5K1/8/8 w - -',Now both third rank pawns are defended.  I felt I'd missed something...
711,31,22,Rb7,b'8/1rN2k2/p6p/6pP/8/R5K1/8/8 w - -',Just when I thought I'd forced the win of the pawn I realised that the pin of my N against my R could be fatal but eventually worked something out ...
712,31,23,4Kg4,b'8/r4k2/N6p/6pP/6K1/R7/8/8 b - -',? but this offered Black the opportunity to maintain the pin indefinitely.  46. Rf3+ was necessary.

714,31,25,4Ne4,b'8/4k3/7p/r5pP/4N1K1/5R2/8/8 b - -',Now White's objective is to capture the h-pawn: Black's to prevent this.

720,32,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',My name is Jason Capablanca and I am 9. I am going to make an analysis for you on my game against Strikerx. I do not make many analysis for you to read because now I am playing a lot of real hard players and my games do not look so good any more. And I do not play e4 very much here any more because then I have to know a lot of different openings and I am going to a hard school so I do not have time to study openings so much until summer time. I always do my best and I do not quit. I am writing this analysis because the French Defense is very hard to beat and I had to study with my coach Mr. Marble a lot last year to know how to play it when I went to the Olympiad last year. Maybe this will help you.
721,32,1,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Nd2 breaks a lot of rules. I learned this last year. Black is also breaking a lot of opening rules so it is okay for White to break rules too. White can play 3. exd4 (exchange variation) 3. Nc3 or 3. e5. Nc3 and e5 are hard for White to hold onto the pawns in the middle and exd4 looks good but it does not get an advantage for White. It helps Black get his c8 Bishop out. Black wants White to play e5 so he can start attacking d4. My move is for the Tarrasch variation. Sometimes this Knight goes all the way to f3 so there are lots of pieces defending d4. That happened in this game.
722,32,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',4. e5 I like this variation because it makes Black waste another move with the Knight and Black must decide where to put the Knight. It always should go to d7 so it can help Black play c5 to attack the pawn on d4. But the extra moves let me get my pieces out.
723,32,3,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I only have one chance to get this Bishop out. After that Black will attack my pawn on d4 and I will not have time to take him out again.
724,32,4,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq c6',c5 This is the attack on the center Black is supposed to make. And it is why I played Nd2. You do not see why yet. But you will.
725,32,5,c3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This is the best I think. When Black takes the pawn on d4 it will be replaced with another pawn. That is important to control the middle with pawns and to keep the extra space the e5 pawn has given me.
726,32,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',6. ... Nc6 Do you see how many pieces Black can aim at d4? It is hard to find enough defenders. That is why I played Nd2. You will see why.
727,32,7,Ne2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',7. Ne2 This is why I had to get my f Bishop out on move 5. I must develop this Knight to e2 so that I can have lots of defenders for d4.
728,32,8,c4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2PB4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',7. ... c4?! This is a mistake. It is not part of the opening. But it is not a mistake because of that. It is a mistake because all of the French Defense depends on Black taking the pawns in the middle. Do you see how all of Black's pieces are on the Queen side? I saw this and I was confused. How can Black get his pieces out in the game if they are trapped behind his pawns on the Queen side?
729,32,9,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2n1p3/1p1pP3/2pP4/2P5/PPBNNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',8. ... b5 Now I think I see. He is changing his attack to the back of the pawn chain. he si going to try to aim at c3. But his pieces do not work so good to do this. 
730,32,10,1f4,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/2n1p3/pp1pP3/2pP1P2/2P5/PPBNN1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq f3',10. f4 I can not let Black do all of the attacking. If I do he will find a way to win. So I will try to open up the pawns in front of Blacks King. He is not developed and his King is not safe. So maybe I can get him in the center.
731,32,11,1g6,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1p1p/2n1p1p1/pp1pP3/2pP1P2/2P5/PPBNN1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This makes all of the dark squares on the King side good for my Bishop.
732,32,12,1Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1p1p/2n1p1p1/pp1pP3/2pP1P2/2P2N2/PPB1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',11. Nf3 This move is made most of the time to give another defender to d4. That is why I made Nd2 at the beginning. See how both Knights defend d4? I do not need that now but my Knight is in the way of the Bishop and I am going to attack his King side so It should go over there anyway.
733,32,13,1Be3,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1p1p/2n1p1p1/p2pP3/1ppP1P2/2P1BN2/PPB1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',12. Be3 Maybe this is not so good a move. But if he takes my pawn on c3 I will take with my pawn on b2 and I will be able to control the open b file because my Rooks and Queen are all working together now. So I did my best to find a move to help make him not want to take c3. But I think maybe Ng3 would be good.
734,32,14,1f5,b'1rbqk2r/3nbp1p/2n1p1p1/p2pPP2/1ppP4/2P1BNN1/PPB3PP/R2Q1RK1 b k -',14. f5 see I waited too long for Ng3 and he is getting his pieces working together before I can play f5. I was trying my hardest but he has a rating over 1700 and he is a real good player. So I was afraid maybe I made this into a draw and it would not help the team win the match.
735,32,15,1gxf5,b'1rbqk2r/3nbp1p/2n1p3/p2pPp2/1ppP4/2P1BNN1/PPB3PP/R2Q1RK1 w k -',14. ... gxf5! I hoped he would take with the e pawn. Then I could play 15. Bh6 bxc3 16. bxc3 Bf8 17. Qc1 and he does not dare take my Bishop because my Queen will take back and I will be able to attack his King side. But this way he get's an open file for his Rook. And it will aim at my King. 
736,32,16,1Nh5,b'1rbqk2r/3nbp1p/2n1p3/p2pPp1N/1ppP4/2P1BN2/PPB3PP/R2Q1RK1 b k -',I am hoping to get on f6

That would leave me a lot of good tactics. His King would move to f8 and then I could play Nxe6!! which is a discoverd check on the King so I would win the Queen.
738,32,18,1Qb6,b'1rb1k1r1/3nbp1p/1qn1p2B/p2pPp1N/1ppP4/2P2N2/PPB3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',16. ... Qb6! You see he is a good player. He knows what I am trying to do. He could have played Bf8 and I would have played Qd2. And I do not get to win his Queen this way either. When I was playing before Knelica would let me play easier players and this would work but now my tricks do not work. This is not so bad though. Now the Queen is really trapped behind her pawns on the Queen side.
739,32,19,1Kh1,b'1rb1k1r1/3nbp1p/1qn1p2B/p2pPp1N/1ppP4/2P2N2/PPB3PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Never leave your King in front of a enemy Rook unless you have no choice.

They will take away all of the squares for his pieces. So he can not let me leave them there. He must trade them away as fast as he can.
743,32,23,2Bxg5+,b'1r1k2r1/3n1p1p/bqn1p3/p2pPpBN/1ppP4/2P5/PPB3PP/R1Q2R1K b - -',20. Bxg5+ He is a good player and he will not let me keep my Knights up forward. He knows to trade them. So I do not get so good an advantage.

This is bad because there are lots of pawns on the board and Bishops are not so good when there are so many pawns in the way. Now I must do what Black wants me to do. I must make pawns go away. So I have to find a good way.

When there are no ways to win pieces my coach says make your pieces better. It is going to make his Rooks go backwards and stay behind his pawns. You see? His Bishop is trapped. So His Knight is trapped. Even his Queen is trapped. So If I make his Rooks go backwards he does not have a way to get me.

He is a real good player and he just made a change in the start of the game that did not work. He got his pieces trapped and that is to bad. I hope this helps you if you play against the French. My mom helped by typing what I said. So if there is a big mistake it is her fault. LOL

3. e5 has had a bit of a resurgance in the resent past. Against 3. e5 I recommend attacking white's centre right away with 3. ...c5. 

3. exd5 is very similar to the exchange varation in the french is of no real threat to black. Although he needs to watch out for possible attack along the light square weakness. white will often try moves like Nb5 Qa4 etc. These are paired with early ...Bd7 and ...a6"

Although ig white is going to play for a serious advantage then this is the only move. The Ng3 is more solid and positional in nature. It's tactical idea is to support the h2-h4-h5 push.

Thus the vast majority of games revolve around a battle for e5. Strategically speaking if white can gain control of the e5 square then black will almost always lose. 

So from black's point of view is critical to maintain the balance of power of e5. However black is not without his resources since d5 can become a very strong point for a knight. Plus once white plays Ne5 black can most of the time undermine it by playing ...c5 or f6 under certain circumstances. "

But from black's perspective the exchange for his weakest bishop for white's strongest bishop is a strategic victory. So in this away the caro-kann has a major advantage over the french in that the LSB is not a liablity. "

For most players it is a matter of when. Some like to occupy early while others like to hold out for a clear break. I played 8. Ne5 to setup a trap for Ashleyanderson's learning benefit.

This natural looking move is serious mistake by Ashelyanderson. Because he misses the threat. The threat is Nxg6! which causes serious weaknesses in black defence.

The only correct move is ...Bh7.

If you play ...h6 early it is important to know the how and when...h6 is to be played. As there is a very familar trap in the caro-kann. 

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 and now instead of Bf5 black might play 4...Nd7 if so then this is the line 5.Ng5 now it is tempting to play h6 but it's a mistake because after h6 then 6.Ne6(if fxe6 then 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Qxg6#) 6...Qb6 7.Nxf8 Nxf8 8.Nf3 with the advantage getting back to the right line 5...Ngf6 6.Bd3 e6 (if 6...h6 then 7.Ne6 fxe6 and 8.Bg6#) 7.N1f3 Bd6 8.Qe2 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qe2 b6 12.Bd2 Bb7 13.0-0-0 Qc7 if 13...o-o then g4! opening lines on the enemy king

It requires strong memorization and familarity of the many openning lines. 

The flip side is that if you like to play the french then many of the ideas employed by white and black will be familar to you. So the jump for you will not be as great. I am glad that Ashleyanderson played the way he did because I hoped he learned a valueable lesson in the most dangerous line attacking theme that white has which is the kingside attack on g6. "
