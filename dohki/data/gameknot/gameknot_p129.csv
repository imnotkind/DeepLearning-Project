First up - I hope you have all enjoyed your Christmas and I wish all of you a Happy New Year.  I will start the New Year with a brevity.  We have all been hit over the head with the rule do not bring out your queen too early in the opening.  Also pawn grabbing is widely condemned. Sometimes however there are exceptions to these rules and this game is one of them.  I decided to kick off with an opening which has previously been unsuccessful for me to see if I can improve on it.  That opening is Larsen's Opening with 1. b3."

Although the BK is well placed in the centre now that the queens are off the board I can feel confident of forcing a victory here.  My opponent thought so and waved the white flag.

87,5,3,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I don't really like this move. 4. ...Bd6 may be playable but it lessens black's pressure on my d5 pawn and the bishop would really prefer to be on the a7-g1 diagonal (although it would be dubious in view of 5. d4 if 4. ...Bc5 were to be played immediately). The game seemed to go downhill from here.

93,5,9,c6,b'rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1ppb1n2/3P4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',Black was struggling to develop his queenside so he now tries to liquidate the source of the problem: my d5 pawn. However this allows me the time I need to put my pieces on aggressive posts and thus only makes the situation worse. A better continuation would have been 11. ...Bf5 to involve his LSB in the game.
94,5,10,Bg4,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1ppb1n2/3PB3/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1B1R w - -',If black had played 12. ...cxd5 then 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 14. Nxd5 maintains my advantage
95,5,11,1Re1,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1ppb1n2/3PB3/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP1Q2PP/2K1RB1R b - -',13. Qf4 may have been better but this move is at least ok.
96,5,12,1Bxf3,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1ppb1n2/3PB3/2PP4/2N2b2/PP1Q2PP/2K1RB1R w - -',I think black may have been hoping to smash up my kingside pawns in an attempt to get some counterplay. However this overlooks the opening of the g file and I get a lot of play against his king.
97,5,13,1Rg1,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1ppb4/3PB2n/2PP4/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K1RBR1 b - -',There is no time to waste! I land a rook on the g file before black can muster a decent defence to the threats around his king. I already have 2 pieces attacking g7.
98,5,14,1Bxe5,b'rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/1pp5/3Pb2n/2PP4/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K1RBR1 w - -',Removing 1 of the attackers is a good idea
99,5,15,1dxe5,b'rn1q2k1/p4ppp/1pp5/3PP2n/2P5/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K2BR1 b - -',Now I have a very nice pawn center.
100,5,16,1Kh8,b'rn1q3k/p4ppp/1pp5/3PP2n/2P5/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K2BR1 w - -',I was threatening 18. Qh6
101,5,17,Na6,b'r2q3k/p4ppp/np6/3PP2n/8/2N2P1B/PP1Q3P/2K3R1 w - -',19. ...Nd7 looks natural but it still loses to 20. Bg4
102,5,18,g6,b'r2q3k/p4p1p/np4p1/3PP2n/6B1/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K3R1 w - -',20. ...Qh4 was best but after 21. Ne4 followed by 22. Nd6 black is going to find it hard to prevent my pawns advancing.
103,5,19,2Bxh5,b'r2q3k/p4p1p/np4p1/3PP2B/8/2N2P2/PP1Q3P/2K3R1 b - -',Black can't recapture because then 22. Qh6 leads to mate in 3.
104,5,20,2Qd4+,b'r7/p5kp/np2p1p1/3P4/3Q2Bq/2N2P2/PP5P/2K3R1 b - -',Although 24. Qd4 isn't the best move it forces some simplifications that make winning a lot easier.
105,5,21,Kxf6,b'r7/p6p/np2pkp1/3P4/6B1/2N2P2/PP5P/2K3R1 w - -',Now that the queens are off there is little hope for black.
106,5,22,Nc5,b'r7/p6p/1p2Pkp1/2n5/6B1/2N2P2/PP5P/2K3R1 w - -',26. ...Nc5 speeds up the win for me as it allows me to exchange even further.
107,5,23,Ke5,b'r7/p6p/1p2P1p1/4k3/4P1B1/8/PP5P/2K3R1 w - -',It is merely a matter of time before black loses. I now proceed to force home my e pawn.
108,5,24,2Rd1,b'r7/p6p/1p2P1p1/4k3/4P1B1/8/PP5P/2KR4 b - -',A minor error. Kd2 would have been more efficient.
109,5,25,3Rxh7,b'4r3/p6R/1p2P1p1/8/4k1B1/8/PP5P/2K5 b - -',Although this looks like me just being greedy I actually was trying to clear the d7 square for my bishop.
110,5,26,3e7,b'4r3/4P2R/1p4p1/p7/5kB1/7P/PP6/2K5 b - -',1 square to go...
111,5,27,3Bd7,b'4r3/3BP2R/1p4p1/p5k1/8/7P/PP6/2K5 b - -',And now black resigned because he can't stop my pawn queening without losing his rook.

113,6,1,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01) White correctly takes.
114,6,2,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the Lasker variation. I like white's move attacking the queen.
115,6,3,Bc4,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',3. d4 is more common but nothing wrong with this...
116,6,4,Nf3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',both knights come out
117,6,5,O-O,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Both sides develop. c6 is often played by Black to give an escape square to the queen after d4 and Bd2 or less usually a3 and b4
118,6,6,Be2,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White just wastes a move in retreating the Bishop. Re1 h6 d4 or d3 were all better. White is just a tempo down on the main line now.
119,6,7,d4,b'rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq d3',At last!
120,6,8,Bb4,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1b1P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This position has actually occoured in other games but Black played Be7 Bd6 or Nbd7 all of which are stronger because of what follows next....
121,6,9,Bd2,b'rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1b1P2b1/2N2N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Both sides develop
122,6,10,1a3,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1b1P2b1/P1N2N2/1PPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',A logical move from white putting the question to the bishop
123,6,11,1Bxc3,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/3P2b1/P1B2N2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So white has obtained the two bishops in an open position.
124,6,12,1Ne5,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/4N3/3P2b1/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',This isn't really a bad move but I would have thought it better to preserve the white squared bishops. Maybe moves like b3 followed by Bb2 and c4 is a better plan? What do you think dear reader?
125,6,13,1Qxe2,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/4N3/3P4/P1B5/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',So Bishops are exchanged
126,6,14,1Nxd7,b'r4rk1/ppqN1ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P4/P1B5/1PP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',White rather falls in with White's plan here. Maybe White could play 14. Bb4 hitting the rook on f8 and after it moves play Nc4 and maybe playing a bishop or knight into d6 at some point. Or maybe just playing Nd3 maintaining the tension. White has a slight spacial advantage in the centre thanks to the pawn on d4 and so should be avoiding exchanges.
127,6,15,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P4/P1B5/1PP1QPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Sound development by white.
128,6,16,1Bd2,b'r4rk1/pp1q1ppp/2p1p3/3n4/3P4/P7/1PPBQPPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White wisely avoids the exchange on c3.
129,6,17,1Qg4,b'r3r1k1/pp1q1ppp/2p1p3/3n4/3P2Q1/P7/1PPB1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White seems to be dreaming of a king side attack but with so few minor pieces left on the board it is not really on.
130,6,18,1Qg3,b'r3r1k1/pp1q1ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P4/P5Q1/1PPB1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Still dreaming of attacks....
131,6,19,1Qd3,b'r3r1k1/pp1q1ppp/2p1p3/8/3Pn3/P2Q4/1PPB1PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',The queen is driven away. Black could just exchange on d2 and it will be hard for either side to make much of the position.
132,6,20,2Bf4,b'r3r1k1/pp1q2pp/2p1p3/5p2/3PnB2/P2Q4/1PP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',White may have an edge now the Bishop can go to e5....
133,6,21,2c3,b'3rr1k1/pp1q2pp/2p1p3/5p2/3PnB2/P1PQ4/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',I don't like c3 I prefer Be5

144,7,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Här tänkte jag mig en klassisk Queen's gambit och var inställd på att möta 2 c4.
145,7,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Queen's pawn (D00) stonewall attack istället för Queen's gambit. Helt ny variant för mig så jag fick tänka själv tidigt i detta parti.
146,7,2,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Bygger upp bondekedjan samtidigt som jag försvarar d-bonden. Vanligaste svaret på stonewall attacken är dock 2...Nf6 tätt följt av 2...Bf5 vars statistik är till svarts fördel.
147,7,3,Bd3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Vit bryter mot grundregeln att S skall mobiliseras före L men enligt statistiken är 3.Bd3 till vits fördel i denna variation. Vanligaste draget är dock 3.Nf3.
148,7,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Här går jag spontant ut med kungsspringaren för att utveckla pjäserna normalt. Det visade sig vara det vanligaste svaret i denna variation och statistiskt är 3...Nf6 till vits fördel.
149,7,5,Bd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Här avviker vit från stonewall attacken där 4.Nf3 är det vanligaste svaret i denna variation.

However black made some bad moves and you took advantage of it!  Sometimes that's how you win you know?  I know I've won some games where I made some mistakes in the early game but then my opponent made some mistakes in the mid game.  I was able to take advantage of his mistakes and come back for the win.  In essence I felt this game was won due to black's poor play in the mid game.  He had better position and piece advantage...but made some grave errors and gfb3 made him pay for it!  At this point the game is basically over and I don't have any more relevant thoughts on the game.  Congrats gfb3!  Good game!

220,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I'd played jevgeni four times before on gameknot.   Looking back over those games at the start of this one told me two things - 1) he went for unusual openings hypermodern in the extreme with no real central presence and 2) I didn't have a great record against him (2-0-2 with white winning every time).   It's no use thinking your opponent's opening isn't great if he still beats you with it!   This time around though I scored a nice win.
221,9,1,c4,b'rn1qk1nr/pbppppbp/1p4p1/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq c3',May as well take some more of the centre while I'm being given the chance.
222,9,2,h6,b'rn1qk1nr/pbppppb1/1p4pp/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I think this move may be too much in this position though; black needs to play a bit more actively than this (although I'm sure id=animusrex would disagree!)
223,9,3,Ne7,b'rn1qk2r/pbppnpb1/1p2p1pp/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Even with his last two moves black is still playing very passively.   There aren't really any weaknesses in his position though with the probable exception of the h-pawn.   He's a good three or four moves away from castling queenside so I decide to pre-empt kingside castling with my next move (similar to my last annotated game actually)
224,9,4,Be3,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1pb1/1pn1p1pp/8/2PPP2P/2NBBN2/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The d4 pawn was hanging
225,9,5,Nb4,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1pb1/1p2p1pp/8/1nPPP2P/2NBBN2/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I think this manoeuvre is too slow for black.   With kingside castling still looking odds-on I'm not about to give up the LSB which can drop back to b1 while still keeping the same range.   Meanwhile black's knight can get kicked back to where it came from after an a3 push; it would retreat having gained nothing from its excursion.
226,9,6,a5,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp1pb1/1p2p1pp/p7/1nPPP2P/2N1BN2/PP3PP1/RB1Q1RK1 w kq a6',I think black really needs to play for the centre here.   Preparing d5 would have been preferable or even playing c5.   I'm not sure what a5 achieves here.
227,9,7,Nb4a6,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp1pb1/np2p1pp/p7/2PPP2P/P1N1BN2/1P3PP1/RB1Q1RK1 w kq -',So as to allow the other knight to develop to c6 and also so as not to hinder the c-pawn.   It's a horrible square for a knight though.

They belong on open or soon-to-be-open files so I put it here eyeing a d5 push and maybe opening lines to the king.   Curiously this is a less effective plan than if the knight were on its ""proper"" c6 square."
229,9,9,1c6,b'rn1qk2r/1b1p1pb1/npp1p1pp/p7/2PPP2P/P1N1BN2/1P3PP1/RB1QR1K1 w kq -',Presumably preparing a d5-push but again I think it's too slow.   However white still needs to capitalise on this to win.

This creates a fair few dark-squared weaknesses around black's king-side and all in exchange for a knight that wasn't really going anywhere.   This will prove costly later.   The doubled pawns are soon cleared.   13...e5 was maybe better; shutting the DSB in but at least keeping things closed.
231,9,11,1Bd4,b'rn1qk2r/1b1p1p2/1p2p1pp/p1nP4/3BP2P/P1P2N2/5PP1/RB1QR1K1 b kq -',Hitting the rook and forcing black's hand a little on the subject of castling.   16...f6 doesn't look too appealing.

233,9,13,Nb3,b'rn1q1r2/1b1p1p1k/1p2p1pp/p2P3P/3BP3/PnP2N2/3Q1PP1/RB2R1K1 w - -',I completely missed this move.   It's always a danger when you're working on an attack that you completely overlook any counter-attack for your opponent.   Similarly black deserves credit for not overlooking the counter-attack while on the defence; many a game has been needlessly lost as a result.   However the more I looked at this move the less concerned I was.   The a1 rook isn't in the game and is as far away as possible from the action (which is starting to swirl around the opposite corner of the board).   With the two bishops aimed at the king there should still be enough for a winning attack.   But moves like 19. Qb2 NxR 20. QxN aren't good enough at all; the queen's mis-placed badly and maybe black can shore up his kingside a little with g5.
234,9,14,1hxg6+,b'rn1q1r2/1b1p1p1k/1p2p1Pp/p2P4/3BP3/PnP2N2/3Q1PP1/RB2R1K1 b - -',!   I think this is the right plan.   There follows a series of forcing moves designed at creating more weaknesses around the king.   This one weakens g6 significantly.
235,9,15,Nxa1,b'rn1q1r2/1b1p3k/1p2p1pp/p2P4/3BP3/P1PQ1N2/5PP1/nB2R1K1 w - -',NxB was probably stronger.

Better though was Nb3 - the knight is dead anyway; Nb3 would divert the queen off its diagonal however temporarily.
240,9,20,2cxd5,b'rn2q1r1/1b1p3k/1p4pp/3PP3/p6N/P2Q4/5PP1/BB2R1K1 b - -',This pawn exchange suits me as well as it opens up the a1-h8 diagonal for my other bishop.   Even though I'm the exchange down this attack almost plays itself for white.
241,9,21,Nd7,b'r3q1r1/1b1n3k/1p1pP1pp/3P4/p6N/P2Q4/5PP1/BB2R1K1 w - -',I think Ra5 would have been better here winning the d-pawn (or forcing the ugly Ba2).   However Qc3 may well transpose to a similar idea to that seen in the game.   The knight itself is probably immune from capture due to 27. PxN QxR+.   However even two exchanges down the power of the bishop-pair and the weaknesses at g6 and h6 are possibly still decisive; the queen can't get back to e8 to cover g6.   I didn't analyse this line though because I found a stronger move.
242,9,22,2Qd4,b'r3q1r1/1b1n3k/1p1pP1pp/3P4/p2Q3N/P7/5PP1/BB2R1K1 b - -',!   g6 has been my target ever since move 18.   This actually removes a defender - the rook - from g6 while allowing a weaker white piece to attack it.   I think black is just lost here.   26... Qe7 puts up a stronger defence but 27. Qg4 looks good then attacking g6 once more.   If nothing else I have 27...Qe8 28. NxP RxN 29. BxR+ QxB 30. QxQ+ KxQ 31. PxN Rd8 (or else Re8 wins) 32. Re6+ picking up another pawn and threatening Bf6 queening or winning the rook.

252,10,4,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',He plays the Smith-Morra Gambit offering a pawn for speedy development.
253,10,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black can accept the pawn but this is good as well a suggestion of Leonard Barden.
254,10,6,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/4P3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',This is the most commonly played move in the position.
255,10,7,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And this is the only decent move for black.
256,10,8,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',So he gets the pawn back

259,10,11,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I need to undermine his pawn before he gets the chance to support it.

267,10,19,1Qe8,b'r1b1qbkr/pp2p1pp/1nnpP3/6N1/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',So I move my queen to protect the f7 square. After the game my opponent suggested he should have picked up the exchange here with Nf7 and Nxh8. The problem is my bishop and knight far outweigh his rook. Later looking on the opening databases was confirmation that black normally wins from such positions.
268,10,20,1Qf3,b'r1b1qbkr/pp2p1pp/1nnpP3/6N1/3P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',He is now threatening a neat mate in 2 - Qf7+ QxQf7 pxQf7 mate! I can of course just play Nd8 but after d5 white's centre pawns are secure and it is hard for black to complete his development. On the opening databases black wins 4 of the 5 games in this variation but wins both the games with the improved move I played.

Black won in Paldus Petr (2015) vs. Folk Petr (2225) 1997. Shredder thinks d5 is the best move for white in this position but assesses the position as +2.13 for black.

387,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This game I played with the black pieces. My opponent was a rating-wise step-down from my earlier one. This game started with 1. e4 a particularly strong move for any level provided that they know what they're doing. The move occupies a center square and attacks another central square on Black's side. This pawn move also allows lines for the bishop and queen to move about the board. Statistically it is the most commonly played move but 1. d4 is more promising as it allegedly has a slightly better win/loss/draw ratio.
388,13,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is my favorite counter to this move. As a King's Pawn Opening both sides must play assertively and there are many tricks involved in these openings. This move mirrors the previous move and has the exact same motives. This is the second most played move according to the chessgames.com database.
389,13,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',2. Nf3 is an excellent move for those beginning the game. It develops a piece attacks two center squares threatens my center pawn and in some openings is hard to dislodge. This move is statistically significantly more played than other openings such as the Danish Gambit the King's Gambit the Vienna game and the Scotch Game.
390,13,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Again I mirror his move by moving a knight but I have different motives this time. I reinforce two center squares but in doing so I am reinforcing my attacked e-pawn. To many this may not sound too breathtaking but this principle of defense is often forgotten in many games including my own. This move also develops a back-rank piece and further creates a rook connection.
391,13,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the Three Knights Game. It is not very often played but it is a perfectly valid opening. This move attempts to further solidify the center and prepare attacks such as d4 or continue easy development with moves like Bc4. Many people play moves like Bc4 Bb5 or d4 instead of this.
392,13,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is the Four Knights Game. Bc5 and Bb4 are perfectly valid but I prefer to keep the game quiet in positions such as this so I like the Four Knights Game. At this point our positions are mirrored so we have equal chances of play that is assuming that White does not always have a subtle advantage by being able to move first.
393,13,6,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is a standard move. Instead of 4. Bc4 which attacks the f7 pawn White wants to threaten the guard of the e5-pawn. This move may or may not harass the player but it is still a sound move.
394,13,7,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is not the best move. I gift my opponent with a pin on my knight and king and I block my f8 bishop from movement. Although I never study openings now that I think of it Bc5 or Bb4 seem like better alternatives to my clumsy move. I favor the Hungarian Defense so this position doesn't appall me as much as it might to the next guy but in every game I wish that my bishop could ever get to c5.
395,13,8,Bxc6+,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2Bp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is not a very impressive move as it removes a bishop which could have a great role in the game in exchange for a knight that was already pinned in. Black may get doubled pawns and a d6-pawn that cannot move without help but White loses the two-bishop advantage. I don't think so much of this but it sincerely does help to have two bishops on the board especially when a piece was just traded off; this means that there will be a more open position positions that two bishops dominate with.
396,13,9,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This was a simple recapture I get a chance to play Ba6 but this is stopped via the opponent's next move.

An interesting move would have been 6. d4 but this seems like it would go better for me.
398,13,11,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I develop my bishop to pin the knight and queen of the enemy. 6. ...Ba6 does not work even if the c3-knight were absent because after 7. O-O Nxe5 8. dxe5 Bxf1 9. Kxf1 I have lost two minor pieces for a rook and pawn which is arguably worse for me.

Besides I have two bishops and I don't want to keep them clustered between my pawns. I also get space for my queen to move this way.
403,13,16,O-O,b'r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/2pp1b2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White wants to get his king safe in order to start that assault I mentioned way earlier. 9. h3 repelling my bishop would have also been interesting.

The only drawback to this is that now White can play 10. h3 Bh5 11. g4 which pushes my bishops to an uncomfortable closed area where his knights can cause damage. In other words I believe that my move was an inaccuracy.
405,13,18,1Qd2,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2pp1b2/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',After this move I saw opportunity to make a winning game. White does relieve himself from a pin but his queen has nowhere to go. Also the only piece protecting his knight now is a king-side pawn. A better move would have been 10. h3 to push my bishop back and continue the attack that way.
406,13,19,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2pp1b2/4p3/4P3/2NP1b2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',As aforementioned I envisioned opportunity after my opponents play. I didn't need two bishops because I got a way to directly assault his king.

411,13,24,1Qd1,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3pp1b1/4P3/2NP1P2/PPP2P1P/3QRRK1 b - -',This is the best move in my opinion. 13. Qe2 would have surely lead to a Mate in 5 or loss of material. This way White can play Ne2 as a countermeasure.
412,13,25,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3pp3/4Pb2/2NP1P2/PPP2P1P/3QRRK1 w - -',Here I am continuing with my plan. There is not much White can do here except for 14. Ne2. Even with that I lock up the position in the center with a move such as 14. ...d4 or better.
413,13,26,1Na4,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3pp3/N3Pb2/3P1P2/PPP2P1P/3QRRK1 b - -',I think that White did not see 14. Ne2 and assumed defeat. this move only moves the knight to a rim. c4 does not do much except block the position with my d4 the following move.
414,13,27,1Qh4,b'r4rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3pp3/N3Pb1q/3P1P2/PPP2P1P/3QRRK1 w - -',I moved my queen to this square to checkmate on h2. 14. ...Qg5+ would have delayed this by a move.

419,14,0,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Interesting move. I thought it should be weak but I could not find any clear refutation. Usually this means the refutation does not exist or that the refutation is that it just does not work against standard play in the longer run. I simply proceeded with normal play
420,14,1,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p3n/8/2B1Ppb1/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',There was a choice here between d3 and d4. Usually I play d4 but the knight not being on f6 makes any push on d5 less important and now I do not have to worry about covering my central pawns.

423,14,4,Bxf4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p3n/8/2B1PB1q/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b kq -',White now has an half-open f-file and the type of attack on f7 for which Muzio players sacrifice a knight.
424,14,5,Ng4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1PBnq/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w kq -',? Black is chasing a mirage on h2

In this case although the bishop is developed Black gets to castle and the f4 pawn is protected it is dangerous to have a bishop and knight abreast to a semi-open file with a pawn that is ready to fork them. In addition the d7 pawn is blocked. Without having to remove the bishop from d6 the only way the c8-bishop can develop is with ...b6 and this is deemed slow in King's Pawn Openings.

The strategic ideas are simple if you known them. In many variations the position becomes closed which might not be such a good idea against a weaker opponent.
504,18,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White plays the traditional line so far.

506,18,3,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Here I actually thought about 5...gxf6 increasing control of the centre and opening up the g-file for the rook but 6. exd5 exd5 looks too ugly.
507,18,4,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',This is fine. After 6. e5 I had planned 6...Bg5 and then if 7. Nf3 Bh6. 
508,18,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Keeping it simple. I cannot do anything to prevent e5 kicking the bishop back. 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 is not any better. Since I probably will castle kingside anyway this is the least commiting developing move.

512,18,9,Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I want to play the thematic break move c5 at some point so Nc6 would be wrong. In addition I might need the knight's support on the kingside.

519,18,16,1Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p3p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',At the moment the rook is only protecting the e-pawn. Later if I want to play the other break move f6 White will exchange at f6 after which the rook will aim at the e6-pawn. Combined with the knight on d4 this practically prevents the f6-idea.
520,18,17,1Qb6,b'r1b2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq2p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',Since I cannot easily develop other pieces the queen might do something useful and give room for the rook on the back rank.

Hitting the strong-looking bishop is the idea here. White either retreats the bishop or allows it to be exchanged with the knight.

Also something like Bc2 and b4 would have been very annoying. In addition White has the space advantage so exchanging makes my position less cramped.

At this point it is useful to stop and think about the future. I have the bishop pair but while the position is closed it is really not an advantage. My goal is to open the position a bit to make the bishops stronger. On the other hand I probably want to make my moves on the queenside while White is more interested in attacking on the kingside. This is dictated by the central pawn structure. White's ideas may involve Ng5 threatening h7-square. I want to answer this with g6. This leaves the dark square a bit weak but since White's dark-squared bishop is off the board that does not matter so much. Now that a moved the rook out of the f8-square the bishop can back up there giving the king adequate protection for the time being. At the same time I discard any ideas involving f6 or f5 since that would weaken my king's position too much while my other pieces are on the queenside. But White's rook on e1 and knight on d4 make such ideas risky anyway. Basically what I want to do next is proceed with pawns on the queenside. After I move my queen away b5-advance is obvious. After preparation I can think about b4. If I can then exchange two pair of pawns on the queenside it should be possible to pressure on the last White pawn and perhaps win it. In that case the d5-pawn will guarantee the win for me.

That does not matter since I will play Rb8 and a5 in most variations anyway. While White is trying to stop Black's ideas the initiative is given to Black.

If the king moves f7 or h7 squares become weak. If it does not move I have to decide how to respond to the knight check.
538,18,35,2g6,b'1rr3k1/2qbbp1p/4p1p1/pp1pP3/3N2N1/P1PQ2RP/1P3PP1/1R4K1 w - -',This is what I decided to do the get rid of the pin. Perhaps 21...Kh8 was still better.

He can't attack c4 with any other pieces other than the pawn it will be a while before he can.

By capturing back with the knight now the knight would have a lovely central square.

Now he lost his position advantage and there are so few pieces on the board that white doesn't have a good opportunity to really hurt joeyjp for his poor pawn position on the right side of the board and away from his king.

Now as we'll see....joeyjp has the opportunity to use this bishop move as a way of pinning the rook on b1.  In essence you'll see how joeyjp uses white's own pieces against him....pretty cool!

On a side note this is how I usually play against my brothers.  I will let him put his own pieces in poor positions and then he ends up blocking his own pieces from having any kind of attacking or defending power.  This is a great skill to learn and chess and can be used at various levels.  However I have found it more difficult to do this type of thing to very good players of course."

You can see what I was talking about.  If you go back the last 10 moves or so.  You'll see that white's bishop and rook on b1 are doing absolutely nothing.  They are just sitting there while joeyjp is developing his pieces and creating a better board position for himself
750,27,12,2Rd7,b'5rk1/2pR1p1p/6p1/prp5/4p1P1/P3P1P1/1b3PK1/1R6 b - -',White should have moved his rook to d2.  He could have possibly done the same thing that joeyjp did to him and use his bishop to block his own knight and remove the rook on b5's attacking power.  So this move here was a poor move I think
751,27,13,3Ke5,b'5rk1/7p/8/2R1Kp2/p1p5/P3P1P1/2r5/8 b - -',Here is another good lesson for players.  If you are at a large piece advantage in the late game.  You should trade is possible!!!!  I know when I first started playing...I would want to keep my pieces and try and increase my piece advantage.  But then I might actually make a mistake and allow my opponent back into the game.  So remember that if your opponent has no pieces on the board and they are behind in piece advantage they will lose 99% of the time.  So I think that joeyjp does a great job here.  He offers to trade pieces and white takes it.
752,27,14,3gxf4,b'5rk1/7p/8/2R1K3/p1p2P2/P3P3/2r5/8 b - -',bad move.  This opens up black's h pawn to a free lane
753,27,15,Rce8,b'4r1k1/8/8/5P2/p2K3R/P1p1r3/8/8 w - -',At this point the game is basically over.  White played an extremely poor mid and late game.  He allowed joeyjp to pin his bishop against his rook.  This caused both his bishop to be blocked by his own pawns and his rook to be blocked by his bishop.  Joeyjp then had the opportunity to develop his pieces and take advantage of white's mistake.  Good job joeyjp!  Good win!  Hope everybody enjoyed this!

Black takes advantage of the weakness on g2 to increase the pressure on White. Black has scored very well in this position in practice.
760,28,5,Nxe4,b'rn1qk2r/1bpp2pp/4p3/6B1/1b1Pn3/2N5/PP2QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',This appears to lose a queen but in fact White is so fragile at c3 and g2 that Black seems to be winning. Fritz is needed to confirm.

762,28,7,1Kf1,b'rn1Bk2r/1bpp2pp/4p3/8/3P4/2b5/P3QPPP/R4KNR b kq -',White resigns possibly on seeing 13...Ba6. However Black may be better advised to play 13...Bxa1. In either case Black retains a comfortable advantage though resignation is maybe a little premature here. 
763,29,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game is from a thematic mini tournament I am currently playing in it begins with a queens gambit. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 it's for people with ratings from 1500-2050 and I am already very glad I entered. Especially as I have already managed a couple of good results like a win against a 2011 rated player (incidentally another Benko gambit won me that game) and now a second win against someone rated over 1700.
764,29,1,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Going for my usual Benko gambit.

766,29,3,cxb5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2ppp1p/5np1/1PpP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So now white is going to accept the gambit after all.

Blacks ideas are seem to reveal themselves for this opening and very little theory knowledge is needed to play black in the benko gambit. A general idea of blacks usual plans is sufficient.
771,29,8,1Qb6,b'r4rk1/3nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PKP/R1BQR3 w - -',I find I often bring my queen to b6 however in the Benko gambit in can just as often end up on a5. either way the point is to pressure whites queen side by having a rook on the a & b files and often supported by the queen.

I began spending alot of time calculating 16.h3 Ne5 17.Nxe5 Nxe5 18.f4 then the spectacular sacrafice 18...c4!? Of course after making the move I realised that I had spent all my time considering this unlikely variation and not put any thought into what would happen if white did anything else. A rather silly thing to do on my part.

Nf2+ 22.Kh4 Bf6# of course it is extremely unlikely this would ever have occurred and even if white had not seen this 18.bxc4 is still bad as black could simply retreat the rook. Though it is fun to look at these lines even if they will never happen.

However I felt it was in blacks best interest to keep material on besides whites pawn isn't going anywhere and black can take it at anytime. Plus I feel more comfortable with blacks position here. What do you think? would you prefer white or black in this position?

It wasn't until just as I went to make my move that I realised what I had done. It became a choice of weather to move my queen to b7 to prevent the white queen landing on c7 however this was obvious when I noticed that this keeps my plan alive.

It means I must be improving as even a few months back this is the sort of thing I would be unlikely to see instantly. After this whites king becomes dangerously exposed. I spent a long time going over many different variations and found that white was in serious danger of being mated if he was not careful. I figured I would at least have a perpetual check if white accepts."

So maybe whites best chance was to play Rad1 after which black maintains his material advantage and comes away with an obviously better position.
790,29,27,2h5+,b'1r4k1/3npp2/3p2p1/3P3p/3qP1K1/6PP/2Q2P2/R3R3 w - h6',"!!
There are probably a couple of ways to entwine the white king in the mating net however this was the one I came up with."
791,29,28,2Kf4,b'1r4k1/3npp2/3p2p1/3P3p/3qPK2/6PP/2Q2P2/R3R3 b - -',Kh4 losses to Qf6# Kg5 losses to Qf6+ Kh6 g5+ Kxh5 Qg6+ Kg4 Ne5# Kf3 losses to Ne5+ And after Rb2 white has to give up the queen or be mated. so this move seems to hold out best. However find blacks next move to keep the white king from safety.
792,29,29,2g5+,b'1r4k1/3npp2/3p4/3P2pp/3qPK2/6PP/2Q2P2/R3R3 w - -',Yep that's right offering a poisonous pawn to drag the white king back into the mating net. The pawn is immune since if white were to accept then mate would soon follow. 26.Kxg5 Qf6+ 27.Kxh5 Qg6+ 28.Kh4 Qh6+ 29.Kg4 Ne5+ 30.Kf5 Qf6# and of course 26.Kf5 meets Qf6# which leaves whites next as the only option.
793,29,30,2Kf3,b'1r4k1/3npp2/3p4/3P2pp/3qP3/5KPP/2Q2P2/R3R3 b - -',Now what happens next still leaves a hollow pit in my stomach. After planning all this out and even plugging in the necessary conditional moves I make the most horrible judgement call. I delete the conditional moves I had set. Of course at this point Rb2!! wins on the spot since it forces white to give up the queen Qc8+ is mate in 11 I believe.However when I was going over my conditional moves to make sure I hadn't gotten confused due to all the variations I thought to myself that there was no reason I couldn't play Ne5+ straight away.  
794,29,31,2Ne5+,b'1r4k1/4pp2/3p4/3Pn1pp/3qP3/5KPP/2Q2P2/R3R3 w - -',Instead of making the instantly winning move I made this blunder! there are at least two reasons Rb2 had to come before this move. 1.Rb2 would mean that I could respond to white playing Ra4 with Qf6+ and more importantly 2.playing Rb2 first would mean my knight was blocking the white queens access to the h3-c8 diagonal after Qc8+. Now black is probably dead lost.
795,29,32,2Qf5,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3PnQpp/3qP3/6PP/1r3PK1/R3R3 b - -',My heart dropped after this. it was now that I realised what I had done.
796,29,33,2Nd3,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Qpp/3qP3/3n2PP/1r3PK1/R3R3 w - -',I thought this was my best shot at making anything worthwhile happen. I also put some thought into Kh6 and f6 but I came to the conclusion that this allowed more opportunities for white to slip up.
797,29,34,3Qxg5+,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P2Qp/3qP3/3n2PP/1r3PK1/R3R3 b - -',I thought that white could do no better than snaffling these two pawns then trading down to a ending where I might have slim drawing chances when suddenly I realised there were ways that white could end my attack and me not get anything out of it. 
798,29,35,3Kh7,b'8/4pp1k/3p4/3P2Qp/3qP3/3n2PP/1r3PK1/R3R3 w - -',Then I realised I had overlooked the possibility of the rook coming to e2. If white were to play it now then we would liquidate into a queen pawn ending where I was two pawns down.
799,29,36,3Ref1,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/3qP3/3n2PP/1r3PK1/R4R2 b - -',But white went with the more defensive approach.
800,29,37,3Nxf2,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/3qP3/6PP/1r3nK1/R4R2 w - -',! I think this was the best move black could have made in this position. I think whites best bet here might be to accept the queen pawn ending with Rxf2 and hope that one extra pawn would be enough to win.
801,29,38,3Rab1,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/3qP3/6PP/1r3nK1/1R3R2 b - -',?? This move stunned me. After I had given the game away in a completely won position white goes and blunders his queen giving me slight winning chances or at the very least a draw.
802,29,39,3Ng4+,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/3qP1n1/6PP/1r4K1/1R3R2 w - -',My opponent must have overlooked the family fork at e3 when they made their last move. Or else they missed the mate after Kf3.
803,29,40,3Kf3,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/3qP1n1/5KPP/1r6/1R3R2 b - -',I guess they missed the mate in two. Can you find it?
804,29,41,Qd2#,b'8/4ppk1/3p4/3P1Q2/4PK2/6PP/1r1q3n/1R3R2 w - -',Overall this was one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played I was very lucky to win this after I made the wrong move before. This game was a bit of a confidence booster for me as well. As now I can see from this game that I am beginning to find that I can undergo a successful attack and that my tactical skills aren't too bad. Perhaps one day I will be up to a 1700 - 1800 standard after all.

854,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my most common opening move. It attacks one central square and occupies another. In addition it opens lines for my bishop and queen so that they can easily fortify a location when needed. This move is often played my many players followed by 1. ...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 and a move of choice.
855,33,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This is the Sicilian Defense. Contrary to what one might expect I believe that the opening originated in Italy not Sicily. This is a defense because the move is not as proactive in taking the center as White's move was. Instead the goal of the Sicilian is to attack on the queen-side whereas White normally would attack on the king-side. According to the chessgames.com database 1. ...c5 is the most commonly played counter to king's pawn games among grand masters but I digress. This move does not expose the enemy king and keeps a watch on the d4 square.
856,33,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',When I learned how to play chess I learned to play 2. Nf3 the more common and stable move. However this move leads to a closed Sicilian game and this is a passive way to start the Grand Prix Attack. Normally 2. f4 is played immediately but 2. Nc3 has a better winning percentage because after 2. f4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nd4 Black has a little advantage with his outpost-ed knight.
857,33,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ...d6 is one of the normal moves. It opens lines for the bishop defends the c5-pawn and attacks e5 a central square. In addition when the c5-pawn is lost Black is not left with a horrible pawn structure as in the case of e6 where if White takes a grasp on d5 Black has a weaker d6 square. 2. ...d6 also prepares for 3. ...g6 which is the Dragon variation named due to the pawn structure's resemblance to a dragon.
858,33,4,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',"This move initiates the Grand Prix ""formation"" and is a clear indicator to Black of White's intentions throughout the rest of the game. Seldom does White play this move and not continue on with a Grand Prix Attack. This move does have its downsides however. White could have achieved a better developmental lead over Black and now d4 is an unprotected square. Luckily White has ample time to defend against Black's attacks on that square. Another drawback to the Grand Prix is that if the attack fails like many Sicilian games it almost always means destruction for White."
859,33,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I would have chosen 3. ...Nc6 or 3. ...g6 for consistency but I suppose that this move is just as good. I wanted to refrain from 4. e5 because I would prematurely begin my assault and I would be left with an open king-side diagonal.
860,33,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I believe that Nf3 or d3 would have also worked. I chose this move because it develops a piece attacks d5 and keeps an eye on the f7-diagonal. It was just my preference for this move. Actually d3 would have been a worse move because in the Grand Prix a Bc4 is usually mandated.

As White this is my least favorite opening to deal with because I never studied it and my only experience with it and most Sicilian variations is through the games I have played. Black hopes to place his ""Dragon bishop"" on g7 so that he can wreck havoc upon the longer diagonal. If the bishop is not removed it can be fatal for White."

I didn't fret because a6 was not occupied by his pawn. However Nd4 was the move I feared in the opening but now that is detached from my perspective.
868,33,14,Qe1,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2B1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b - -',I continue my attack by engaging my queen. If Black plays Nd4 I would recapture and move my other knight to e2 or an equally effective square. Qe1 is a move that is commonly seen in the Sicilian openings.
869,33,15,e5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w - e6',This was an inaccuracy by Black. Now the Dragon bishop is blocked in the sense that it cannot fully control that diagonal after the recapture and d5 is now a weak square for him.
870,33,16,fxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1P3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b - -',My intention was to nullify the Dragon bishop completely. Also this move makes the f-file semi-open so that my rook can more easily lift.
871,33,17,dxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w - -',If 9. ...Nxe5 10. Nxe5 dxe5 11. Nd5 or an equally effective move is better for me because the some knights are traded and the Grand Prix favors more central control.
872,33,18,1Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',I attack the c5 pawn. It's supposed to fall early in the game so let's make it fall now.
873,33,19,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/1pn2np1/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',This protects the c5 pawn but now all countermeasures for Black are gone. Better would have been not to move a pawn.
874,33,20,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/1pn2np1/2pNp3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',I occupy d5 with an outpost-ed knight. If a capture happens I recapture with my bishop and create a pin between the knight and rook.
875,33,21,1Nxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/1pn3p1/2pnp3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',This is the recapture. It does assist in f5 but the bishop will prevent that.
876,33,22,1Bxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/1pn3p1/2pBp3/4P3/3PBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',Now I have a double-pin. The game quickly ended from here.
877,33,23,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pn3p1/2pBp3/4P3/3PBN2/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',Protecting the knight wasn't the only worry Black had. Now I can attack while his pieces are pushed back.
878,33,24,1Ng5,b'r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pn3p1/2pBp1N1/4P3/3PB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',I launch my attack with a knight move. Now three pieces attack the f7 square. It is not easy to defend from this.
879,33,25,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3pbp/1pn3p1/2pBp1N1/4P3/3PB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',The goal of this move was to move the knight to a better square. Sadly this was too late.
880,33,26,1Nxf7,b'1r1q1rk1/pb3Nbp/1pn3p1/2pBp3/4P3/3PB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',When you can win a free pawn take the free pawn! I wanted more than the pawn so I took with the knight and not the bishop. Capturing with the rook would have made the game somewhat different.
881,33,27,1Qd7,b'1r3rk1/pb1q1Nbp/1pn3p1/2pBp3/4P3/3PB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - -',This move saves the queen from capture for now. Better would have been Qe7 or possibly Rxf7 but because I am rushed and do not know how to save annotations to continue for later this is an interesting variation for the reader to analyze.
882,33,28,1Nxe5+,b'1r3rk1/pb1q2bp/1pn3p1/2pBN3/4P3/3PB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - -',I take the pawn and make a discovery check. Now I win the queen. As a result my opponent resigned here. From this game beginners can learn about the Sicilian Grand Prix and Dragon variation and advanced players can enjoy an amusing game. Thanks for your time everybody and I hope that my rushing didn't make too bad of an annotation!

884,34,1,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',This is not a move I have seen before and the game shows why.
885,34,2,Kf8,b'rnbq1knr/pppp1Bpp/8/2b5/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQ -',If Kxf7 then Qxh5 picks up Bc5. It is not clear to me which is better.
886,34,3,Qh5,b'rnbq1knr/pppp1Bpp/8/2b4Q/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',I think this is forced since retreating the bishop meets with Qh4+ and horribleness for white
887,34,4,Qe7,b'rnb2knr/ppppqBpp/8/2b4Q/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',Eyeing both the bishop and e4 with check. 
888,34,5,Bxg8,b'rnb2kBr/ppppq1pp/8/2b4Q/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',Forced since retreating the bishop allows black to play Nf6 chasing the Queen off and gaining the initiative and probably the advantage.
889,34,6,Qxe4+,b'rnb2kBr/pppp2pp/8/2b4Q/4qp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',A somewhat logical move since the pawn is taken with check but after the knight covers the king black can not both take my bishop and protect his own. Better is simply taking 6. ... Kxg8 and after 7.d3 aim to play g6 d6 and trying to defend the position.
890,34,7,Qxg2,b'rnb3kr/pppp2pp/8/2Q5/5p2/8/PPPPN1qP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',"Black has no time for pawn-grabbing however tempting. Black needs to develop desperately so 9. ... Nc6 seems logical.
"
891,34,8,Rg1,b'rnb3kr/pppp2pp/8/2Q5/5p2/8/PPPPN1qP/RNB1K1R1 b Q -',A lot of white's moves are nearly forced and good at the same time. This forces black to retreat
892,34,9,Qxh2,b'rnb3kr/pppp2pp/8/2Q5/5p2/8/PPPPN2q/RNB1K1R1 w Q -',The pawn that broke the camel's back; black grabs another pawn overlooking the Queen trap: Qd5+ followed by Rh1.
893,34,10,c6,b'rnb2k1r/pp1p2pp/2p5/3Q4/5p2/8/PPPPN2q/RNB1K2R w Q -',Probably hoping for RxQh2
894,34,11,1Qd6+,b'rnb2k1r/pp1p2pp/2pQ4/8/5p2/8/PPPPN2q/RNB1K2R b Q -',And now the queen is lost and black resigned.

897,35,2,Qg5,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/6q1/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Interesting. Never saw this move before this game. I think the game database had good stats on this move but I think the game shows it does not quite work for black. 
898,35,3,Qh3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BPPp2/5N1q/PPP4P/RNBQK1R1 w Qkq -',Already black's lost too many tempo's for the extra pawn. Neglecting development is always very dangerous in the king's gambit and perhaps more so in the Bishop lines.
899,35,4,Bxf7+,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/8/3PPp2/5N1q/PPP4P/RNBQK1R1 b Qkq -',My opponent missed that the bishop can not be taken. Still after e.g. 7. Kd8 Bxf4 white has a huge lead in development an enemy king trapped in the centre a advanced queen to harass and will most likely win.  
900,35,5,Nxh3,b'r1b1kbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/8/3PPp2/7N/PPP4P/RNBQK1R1 b Q -',
901,36,0,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',White here is making a bid for control of the center while Black is aiming to limit White's control of the center and creating a fianchetto opportunity.  Black playing for the counterattack.
902,36,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',White has aimed to counter Black's knight while Black has constructed the fianchetto.  Black is not in a position to move the knight and free up the bishop's potential but can do it soon.
903,36,2,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P4/2NBP3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',White is attacking well.  Black playing defensive setting up for an eventual move to e5 to have some real fun.
904,36,3,Ne4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PN3/3BP3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White aiming to break the tension of this position.
905,36,4,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3bp/3p2p1/4pp2/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq e6',Black will trade knights and chases the bishop away then proceeds to make the move to e5 bidding for control of the center himself.
906,36,5,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3bp/6p1/1B2pp2/8/4P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',White is only too happy to make the move first.  This check will allow White to take Black's queen and keep Black from castling.
907,36,6,e4,b'rnbk3r/pp4bp/2p3p1/5p2/2B1p3/4P3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',So after 11 moves Black has a major advantage in pawn structure and his pawn structure is also more open to development of his non-developed bishop.  Black's king however is exposed and cannot castle as opposed to White's rather protected king and ability to castle.  I give White a very slight advantage right now though it's extremely close.
908,36,7,fxe4,b'rn1k3r/p5bp/2p1b1p1/1p6/4p3/4P3/PPP1B1PP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',So Black's pawn chain is broken but he has both bishops out and dominating the board.
909,36,8,1Bc3,b'r2k3r/p5bp/2p1b1p1/1p2n3/4p3/2B1P2P/PPP1B1P1/R3K1NR b KQ -',Now Black has a pin on White's knight.  The tables have turned a bit.

913,36,12,Bxa2,b'3B4/pk4bp/2p3p1/1p2n3/4p3/4P2P/bPP1B1P1/2K3NR w - -',Might as well take something.
914,36,13,Bh6,b'3B4/pk5p/2p3pb/1p2n3/4p1B1/4P2P/bPP3P1/2K3NR w - -',Pin on the pawn.
915,36,14,Nxg4,b'8/pk5p/2p2Bpb/1p6/4p1n1/4P2P/bPP3P1/2K3NR w - -',No more reason to avoid trading pieces.  It benefits White but there are not too many other options - any move either takes the knight away from the fray or (moving to c4) pins the bishop in.  Not many better options.
916,36,15,Bxg4,b'8/pk6/2p2Bpp/1p6/4p1b1/2P1b3/1P2N1P1/3K3R w - -',White has made a bit of a mistake here.  Black is understandably taking any and every piece he can but he is also able to pin Black's knight making it essentially a shield to be maneuvered around.
917,36,16,Bg5,b'8/pk6/2p3p1/1p4bp/3Bp1b1/2P5/1P2N1P1/3K3R w - -',Black will not trade pieces now.
918,36,17,Ka6,b'8/p7/k1p3p1/1p4bp/3Bp1b1/2P5/1P2N1P1/3K1R2 w - -',White's gonna unleash a fun attack of his own.
919,36,18,Kd3,b'8/8/2p3p1/6bp/1R1Bp1b1/2Pk4/1P2N1P1/3K4 w - -',Black has had to run for his life.  That said he is now attacking the knight.
920,36,19,Bxe2,b'8/8/2p3p1/6bp/1R1Bp3/2Pk4/1P2b1P1/4K3 w - -',Even now things aren't over for White by any means.  He's got an escape route in the f3 square and should Black try to attack it with Bh1 he has a block with his bishop.  Perhaps he should play for a draw rather than a win but he ought not to lose.
921,36,20,3Bf2,b'8/8/2p3p1/6bp/1R2p3/2Pk4/1P2bBP1/4K3 b - -',Calamity.  He has pinned his king in.

944,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this particular game I remembered not to get nervous or angry after making blunders.  Instead I remembered Jack Stockel's advice to remain calm by fixing the mistake looking for a way out of trouble finding the opponent's weakness and spotting his blunder.      
945,38,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He probably made this move to develop his minor pieces right away and I understand because I used to do the same thing immediately.  However I learned from Jack Stockel that it is good to develop minor pieces during the beginning game but not on the first move.  Otherwise it destroys the center prevents one from controlling the center.
946,38,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',"Now it is ok to develop minor pieces and control the center.  Normally I was told that it is usually better to develop the knight before the bishop but there are exceptions.  In my opinion this was one of those exceptions and it was actually !  That is because Jack Stockel told me that ""Knights could be more dangerous then bishops"" and I believe that his knight is extremely dangerous in this position. "
947,38,3,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pppppp/1pn5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',If he had played Nd4 there would not have been an exchange and I would have been forced to move my bishop away from danger.  That is because he would have threatened to capture my bishop with Nxb5.  On the other hand an even exchange is not bad because there have not been captures so the score is still 0.  Now I will force the exchange with Bxc6 followed by dxc6.

Two of these options will become my candidate during the game.  First I could protect the pawn with d3 but I did not want to do this because it is ""pushing"" the pawn.  Second I could also protect the pawn by bringing my other knight into play with Nf3 and I thought that this option was !?  Third this option was one of my candidates but it does not protect the pawn.  If he captures my pawn with Nxe4 I simply respond by capturing his pawn with Nxc6.  In my opinion this was .} due to the position.  If this exchange had occurred his weak pawns on the c square would have given him a tactical disadvantage but this does not happen."

However I am lucky because he does not do this and I still have a chance to fix this problem.

958,38,14,e5,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/pppbpn2/4P3/6N1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',I could have forced the exchange but it was !? because there was a better option.  What was the option?  The fork between his bishop on d6 and knight on f6.  After this move there is an exchange starting with Nxg4.
959,38,15,1Qxg4,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/pppbp3/4P3/6Q1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I decided to take his knight with my queen instead of his bishop with my pawn because I do not want to let him fix his bad pawns on the c square.  If he played cxd6 that would have happened but this was ?.  
960,38,16,1Bxe5,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/ppp1p3/4b3/6Q1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',"If I had captured his bishop my score would be a +2.  Due to this blunder I am now at -1 but I was not going to get angry or worried about this mistake.  That is because Jack Stockel has said ""Don't get nervous.  Try to find a way out of trouble"".  I was also determined not to get mad because it is a distraction.  In fact I lose more concentration with rage then stress.  It is extremely likely that I would have lost this game immediately if I became enraged.  That is because I would have attempted to force my way through by rushing if I was angry.  Instead I remained brave and figured that I might be able to stay in and last through the game if I stayed calm and that will happen."
961,38,17,1b3,b'r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/ppp1p3/4b3/6Q1/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',I chose this candidate because he cannot win a free knight with Bxc3 because of my pawn on d2.  This will bring me one step closer to connecting my rooks.
962,38,18,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2ppp/ppp1p3/4b3/6Q1/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',It is usually a good idea to castle here but this was not a good time to castle.  That will be explained on move 12.
963,38,19,1Ba3,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2ppp/ppp1p3/4b3/6Q1/BPN5/P1PP1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"Normally I would play Bb2 and form a ""Fianchetto"" but that did not happen.  However this move was .} In this position I now threaten to capture his rook with Bxf8.  If that happened his rook would be exchanged for my bishop at best.  Therefore he would only have two choices.  He could play c5 or Re8 but I will still achieve my goal here."
964,38,20,1c5,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2ppp/pp2p3/2p1b3/6Q1/BPN5/P1PP1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is what he decides.
965,38,21,1Rae1,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2ppp/pp2p3/2p1b3/6Q1/BPN5/P1PP1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',Yes this is what I wanted to do because my rooks are now connected.  However this was ?  Instead I should have played Rae2.
966,38,22,1Ne4,b'r2q1rk1/1bp2ppp/pp2pb2/2p5/4N1Q1/BP6/P1PP1PPP/4RRK1 b - -',I figured that this candidate was the best way to protect my pawn on d3 but I was wrong.  Instead I should have played Rd1.  Now he will get a free pawn after the exchange and I will be at -2.  I am referring to Bxe4 followed by 15.Rxe4 Qxd2. 
967,38,23,1Re2,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/2p5/6Q1/BP6/P1PqRPPP/5RK1 b - -',Despite my mistake I am determined to follow Jack Stockel's advice by not resigning in the game.  Therefore I protect my pawn on c2 with my rook.
968,38,24,1Qa5,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/q1p5/6Q1/BP6/P1P1RPPP/5RK1 w - -',"In this position he is forced to move his queen away from ""harm's way"" but he threatens to capture my bishop with Qxa4."
969,38,25,1Qa4,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/q1p5/Q7/BP6/P1P1RPPP/5RK1 b - -',This protects my bishop and forces his queen to escape.  Of course I could have forced an exchange with Qxa5 followed by bxa5 but I did not want to do this and give him another pair of doubled pawns.  That is because I learned from i have arrived that doubled pawns can be good if they are not captured.  I did not want to give him that advantage because I knew that I would not be able to recapture his doubled pawns.
970,38,26,1Qb5,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/1qp5/Q7/BP6/P1P1RPPP/5RK1 w - -',He is now trying to get his queen away from danger but I am not going to let that happen.
971,38,27,1c4,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/1qp5/Q1P5/BP6/P3RPPP/5RK1 b - c3',I respond by attacking his queen with two pieces.  I am referring to the pawn on c4 and my queen on a4.  If I am guessing correctly this is a reversed fork.   
972,38,28,1Qe8,b'r3qrk1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/2p5/Q1P5/BP6/P3RPPP/5RK1 w - -',Now he retreats with his queen but I will force an exchange with Qxe8 followed by Rfxe8.
973,38,29,2Rd1,b'r3r1k1/2p2ppp/pp2pb2/2p5/2P5/BP6/P3RPPP/3R2K1 b - -',I chose this candidate to put pressure on the d square.  That will be explained on move 21.
974,38,30,2a5,b'r3r1k1/2p2ppp/1p2pb2/p1p5/2P5/BP6/P3RPPP/3R2K1 w - -',I am not sure why he made this move.  In this position c6 would have been better.
975,38,31,2Rd7,b'r3r1k1/2pR1ppp/1p2pb2/p1p5/2P5/BP6/P3RPPP/6K1 b - -',That is because I now threaten to capture his free pawn with Rxc7.  If this happens he will be in bad shape because he has two pawns on the c file but he corrects this blunder.
976,38,32,2Re7,b'r5k1/2pRrppp/1p2pb2/p1p5/2P5/BP6/P3RPPP/6K1 w - -',At this point he will force an exchange with Rxe7 followed by Bxe7.
977,38,33,2Rd2,b'r5k1/2p1bppp/1p2p3/p1p5/2P5/BP6/P2R1PPP/6K1 b - -',In this position my goal is to play Rd7 so that I could threaten to capture his free pawn with Rxc7.  This time however he immediately figures out my plan and does not make the same mistake.
978,38,34,2Bd6,b'r5k1/2p2ppp/1p1bp3/p1p5/2P5/BP6/P2R1PPP/6K1 w - -',Instead he responds with his bishop.
979,38,35,2Bb2,b'r5k1/2p2ppp/1p1bp3/p1p5/2P5/1P6/PB1R1PPP/6K1 b - -',I do not remember why I made this move.
980,38,36,2f6,b'r5k1/2p3pp/1p1bpp2/p1p5/2P5/1P6/PB1R1PPP/6K1 w - -',I do not know why he chose that candidate but he corrects this blunder.
981,38,37,2Re2,b'r5k1/2p3pp/1p1bpp2/p1p5/2P5/1P6/PB2RPPP/6K1 b - -',"I want a free piece instead of an even exchange because I am ""down material"" and Jack Stockel has told me that a free piece is generally better then a mere exchange.  Therefore I threaten to capture his pawn with Rxe6."
982,38,38,2e5,b'r5k1/2p3pp/1p1b1p2/p1p1p3/2P5/1P6/PB2RPPP/6K1 w - -',He corrects the blunder by protecting his pawn.
983,38,39,2Re4,b'r5k1/2p3pp/1p1b1p2/p1p1p3/2P1R3/1P6/PB3PPP/6K1 b - -',In this position I do not see how anyone can win.  Consequently I simply offer him a draw and he accepts the draw offer.  There is a highest rating won against and a lowest rating lost.  Well this was my second highest rating drawn against and my highest rated draw was against Jack Stockel my chess coach in three or four different games.  Therefore this was one of my best games ever and my best game on this site. 
984,39,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',This as a bid to control the center.
985,39,1,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',Already we can see that this game will hinge around the two e-pawns.
986,39,2,g5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1n2/4p1p1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq g6',Confusing.  Black's motivation for this one is difficult to figure out.
987,39,3,Bxg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Obvious to take the hanging pawn and pin the knight to the queen.
988,39,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',An attack on the queen simple enough.
989,39,5,Kxd8,b'rn1k1b1r/ppp2p1p/3p4/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',White chooses to trade queens and eliminate the bishop exploiting his better control of the center (especially the d5 square).
990,39,6,Bg7,b'rn1k3r/ppp2pbp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',More bolstering the center.
991,39,7,Bxf7,b'rn1k3r/ppp2Bbp/3p4/4p3/4P1n1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Another pawn en prise and it's taken.
992,39,8,1Bh5,b'rn1k1r2/ppp3bp/3p4/4p2B/4P1n1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White's bishop is chased off the square but continues its attack.
993,39,9,1c6,b'rn1k1r2/pp4bp/2pp4/4p2B/4P1n1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',A decent hope to attack the d5 square but a knight lost.
994,39,10,d5,b'rn1k1r2/pp4bp/2p5/3pp3/4P1B1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Having lost the knight Black might as well press on.
995,39,11,1Nxd5,b'rn1k1r2/pp4bp/8/3Np3/6B1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Even more stupid on Black's part.  White's control over the center is almost complete.
996,39,12,1c3,b'r2k1r2/pp4bp/2n5/3Np3/6B1/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Black is trying to hold onto a little bit of the center.  White intends to press on to victory.
997,39,13,1Ng5,b'r2k1r2/pp4bp/2n5/3N2N1/4p1B1/2PP4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',A good attack by Black but White has spotted something.
998,39,14,1Ne6+,b'r2k1r2/pp4bp/2n1N3/3N4/6B1/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Black has missed the triple fork.
999,39,15,1Nxf8+,b'r4N2/pp1k2bp/2n5/3N4/6B1/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Black moves badly to escape the check and is met with the loss of a rook and a double check.
1000,39,16,Kxd5,b'r7/pp4bN/2n5/3k4/6B1/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',White will take another pawn.  He has the kingside completely at his mercy and can deal with the loss of a knight.
1001,39,17,1Kd2,b'r7/pp4bN/2n5/3k4/6B1/2Pp4/PP1K1PPP/R6R b - -',The king must get involved as Black's is almost halfway across the board.
1002,39,18,2Bf3+,b'r7/pp4bN/2n5/8/4k3/2Pp1B2/PP1K1PPP/R6R b - -',White will chase Black's king away.
1003,39,19,2Rhe1,b'r7/p5bN/2p5/8/5k2/2Pp4/PP1K1PPP/R3R3 b - -',White after eliminating some of Black's tools is now ready for the last attack.
1004,39,20,2bxc3,b'r7/p6N/2p5/8/5k2/2Pp4/P2K1PPP/R3R3 b - -',Why? Why? Why the useless sacrifice of his last minor piece?
1005,39,21,Rxh2,b'8/p7/2p2N2/8/5k2/2Pp4/P2K1PPr/R3R3 w - -',No choice.
1006,39,22,2Re4+,b'8/p7/2p2N2/8/4Rk2/2Pp4/P2K1PPr/R7 b - -',Note how White has used the black pawn as a piece of protection and is able to attack instead of run away from Black's rook.
1007,39,23,2Ng4,b'8/p7/2p5/5k2/4R1N1/2Pp4/P2K1PPr/R7 b - -',White will trade rooks.
1008,39,24,2Ne3+,b'8/p7/2p5/5k2/4R3/2PpN3/P2K1Pr1/R7 b - -',Now he WILL.
1009,39,25,3Nxd3+,b'8/p7/2p5/8/8/2PN4/P2K1k2/R7 b - -',Black's hope is gone.
1010,39,26,3c4,b'8/8/8/8/2PN4/p7/P2K1k2/4R3 b - -',Now simply to queen and win easily.
1011,39,27,4Qh6#,b'8/8/7Q/8/3N4/p6k/P2K4/6R1 b - -',White was already winning when his king moved to the d2 square but the use of the pawn as a shield allowed him an easier and more simple win.
