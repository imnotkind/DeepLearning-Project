34,1,5,Nbd2,b'rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/q3p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Interesting choice of squares for the knight. If white is planning to leave c3 open for the pawn he should just play c3 right away. The only other explanation for not playing Nc3 is that white wants to leave c4 as a possibilty. I guess that is a thought but I still like Nc3 better.
35,1,6,d5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp4pp/2p2p2/q2pp3/3PP3/4BN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq d6',It is the right of the better developed side to open lines and attack so this move is a positional blunder. Black would be better to keep the position closed and try to catch up in development.
36,1,7,dxe5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp4pp/5p2/q2pP3/8/4BN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',These last two captures were correct for white as he is more developed and opening lines will facilitate the attack on the black king.
37,1,8,f5,b'rnb1kbnr/pp4pp/8/q2pPp2/8/4BN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Not sure why black refuses to recapture the e5 pawn. He is going to be down a pawn either way and this keeps the position slightly more closed but two moves ago he was trying to open the position so it probably isn't fear of opening the position further.
38,1,9,Bd3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp4pp/8/q2pPp2/8/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Developing with an attack on a weak point and preparing to castle. Nice play!
39,1,10,Nh6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/7n/q2pPp2/8/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',An awkward way to protect f5 but at least black has decided to develop a piece. The knight is probably better placed on e7 but perhaps black is saving that square for the f8 bishop.
40,1,11,O-O,b'rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/7n/q2pPp2/8/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Positionally this game is almost over. White has a huge lead in development is up a pawn and black's king is still trapped in the center.
41,1,12,Bc5,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/7n/q1bpPp2/8/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',A reasonable looking move by black. This prepares castling to safeguard the king and offers to trade off one of white's attackers. But looks can be deceiving and this is actually bad as white shows with his next.
42,1,13,1Nb3,b'rnb1k2r/pp4pp/7n/q1bpPp2/8/1N1BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Attacking the queen while putting a second attacker on the c5 bishop this move wins a piece.
43,1,14,1Nxc5,b'rnb1k2r/ppq3pp/7n/2NpPp2/8/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',An interesting way to capture. Although at this point any move by white will win I think taking with the bishop is better here. The main reason is that it would inhibit castling by covering the f8 square. But perhaps white was anticipating Bxh6 after black castles to break up the remaining pawn cover of the king.
44,1,15,1Ng4,b'rnb1k2r/ppq3pp/8/2NpPp2/6n1/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',"Moving a piece a second time when there are still pieces waiting to be developed is a violation of opening principles and this is therefore a bad move. It does attempt to remove the defender of the c5 knight so that if white overlooks this transparent threat black could theoretically win a piece with ...Nxe3 followed by ...Qxc5. But white has numerous ways to defend this ""threat"" such as Nb3 Qd2 Qe2 or even Bd4. Notice that black is attacking the e5 pawn twice and it is only defended once so black can win that pawn but if I were white I would sacrifice it and play Nb3 looking for a sequence like:
12. Nb3 Nxe5
13. Nxe5 Qxe5
14. Re1

60,1,31,2Rab8,b'1r3rk1/p5pp/4q3/1B1pP3/3P1pn1/5Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',At least black will not repeat his mistake and x-rays the b2 pawn.
61,1,32,2a4,b'1r3rk1/p5pp/4q3/1B1pP3/P2P1pn1/5Q2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - a3',This is a safe and good way to stifle black's attempted counterplay on the queenside. Notice that if black tries ...Rb6 planning ...a6 white can gain the tempo needed to protect the b pawn with Be2 putting a second attacker on the knight. After black either moves or protects the knight white plays b3 so the queen can protect the pawn. Eventually white can convert this 2-1 majority into a passed pawn that together with the passed e pawn will put tremendous pressure on the black defenders.
62,1,33,2Rb6,b'5rk1/p5pp/1r2q3/1B1pP3/P2P1pn1/5Q2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Black seems unaware that his planned ...a6 will not work.

64,1,35,2a6,b'5rk1/6pp/pr2q3/1B1pP3/P2P1pn1/5Q2/1P3PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',Since white has allowed the bishop to be attacked black attacks it.

and white is still up 2 pawns.
But black can improve on that line with 26...Nxh2 when black ends up winning the h pawn:
27. Kxh2 Qxc6.
Of course as we shall see white doesn't find 27. Kxh2 and ends up losing his queen for a piece."

95,1,66,4Bxd7,b'4R3/3B4/p2k4/8/P5p1/8/5PPK/1q6 b - -',Even though it leaves him with a losing Q vs. R ending this does win material and is the best white has.
96,1,67,4Rg8,b'6R1/3k4/p7/8/P5p1/8/5PPK/1q6 b - -',Might as well attack something but this allows black a nice move.
97,1,68,4Qb4,b'6R1/3k4/p7/8/Pq4p1/8/5PPK/8 w - -',Which he doesn't find. The text defends the g pawn and attacks the a pawn but misses ...Qh7  forking the rook. In a Q vs. R ending it is very difficult for the rook to stay active and avoid getting forked at the same time.

100,1,71,4Rxg4,b'8/3k4/p7/8/q5R1/6K1/5PP1/8 b - -',Can't blame white for trying to put up resistance especially since black doesn't appear to be looking for a way to win.
101,1,72,4Qa3+,b'8/3k4/p7/8/6R1/q5K1/5PP1/8 w - -',What is black's plan now? He must be wanting to push his passed a pawn but then why did he leave the queen blocking the a file? ...Qb3  would have cleared the pawn's path with the tempo gain of a check.

If white wants to queen one of his pawns he will need to cut the black king off so Re4 would accomplish that and after Kf4 the g pawn could get moving.

103,1,74,4Re4,b'8/8/8/p1k5/4RK2/q4P2/6P1/8 b - -',And now the position we should have been at but white has lost a tempo.
104,1,75,4Qb3,b'8/8/8/p1k5/4RK2/1q3P2/6P1/8 w - -',And black figures out his pawn can't walk through the queen and gets out of the way. Another lost tempo so I guess we are even.
105,1,76,a4,b'8/8/8/2k5/p3RKP1/1q3P2/8/8 w - -',And the race is on. Since black will queen first white must be very careful where his pieces are.

108,1,79,5g7,b'8/6P1/8/2kqR3/5K2/5P2/p7/8 b - -',And this transposing of moves ruins the game. By letting the exchange happen on e5 white lets black queen with check.

194,4,19,1exd5,b'r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2p3b1/3p4/6P1/PN1P3P/1BP1BP2/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Black now has a slightly better position. The king is safe a stable pawn chain is in the works rooks are connected and the minor pieces are viable.

199,4,24,2Re1,b'6k1/ppqnrppp/2pb2b1/3p4/6P1/PN1P1B1P/1BPQ1PK1/4R3 b - -',Now black is faced with a problem. Get all the rooks off the board? If so the e file will be temporarily lost. Better instead is to punish white's problem piece the Bf3.
200,4,25,2Bxe5,b'6k1/ppq1rppp/2pb2b1/3pB3/6P1/PN1P1B1P/2PQ1PK1/4R3 b - -',Bd1 was better.
201,4,26,2Rxe5,b'6k1/ppq2ppp/2pb2b1/3pr3/6P1/PN1P1B1P/2PQ1PK1/4R3 w - -',Black now sees the bishop pair advantage on the horizon and presses for it.
202,4,27,2a4,b'6k1/p1q2ppp/1ppb2b1/3p4/P2P2P1/1NP2B1P/3Q1PK1/8 b - -',With dreams of trading off this isolated pawn while punching a hole in black's chain.
203,4,28,2a5,b'6k1/2q2ppp/1ppb2b1/p2p4/P2P2P1/1NP2B1P/3Q1PK1/8 w - a6',Black sees this and stops it immediately.
204,4,29,2Qe3,b'6k1/2q2ppp/1ppb2b1/p2p4/P2P2P1/1NP1QB1P/5PK1/8 b - -',White now moves to control the e file. Obviously this cannot be allowed. Black has a pawn advantge and the bishop pair so exchanging queens usually is a good idea at this point.
205,4,30,2Qd2,b'6k1/4qppp/1ppb2b1/p2p4/P2P2P1/1NP2B1P/3Q1PK1/8 b - -',My opponent is too crafty to oblige:)
206,4,31,2Be4,b'6k1/4qppp/1ppb4/p2p4/P2Pb1P1/1NP2B1P/3Q1PK1/8 w - -',! Strong move. I was hoping white would be willing to exchange bishops here as 30. BxB QxB  31. f3 Qb1 was pretty strong. I had about a dozen conditional moves programmed in if he went for it. But an opponent of this strength surely saw this coming and sidestepped it nicely.
207,4,32,Bf4,b'6k1/4qppp/1pp5/p2p4/P2PbbP1/1NP2B1P/5PK1/3Q4 w - -',The goal here was to get a threat on white's c pawn at some point.
208,4,33,3Bxe4,b'6k1/4qppp/1pp5/p2p4/P2PBbP1/1NP4P/5PK1/3Q4 b - -',? White chooses to trade down which I questioned. Now black can get aggressive with a check tempo.
209,4,34,Bd6,b'6k1/5ppp/1ppb4/p2p4/P2P2P1/1NP2K1P/5P2/8 w - -',And the endgame arrives.I gotta say I was liking my chances here. I felt that I had assured at least a draw and victory was a distinct possibility. The error by my opponent on move 8 which lost a pawn now really comes into play. The only problem is how to punish it?
210,4,35,c5,b'6k1/5ppp/1p1b4/p1pp4/P2P2P1/2P2K1P/3N1P2/8 w - -',A little aggressive as black gains an isolated pawn. It is safely protected (for a time anyway) by the bishop behind it and a king that can get there quick.
211,4,36,3Ke2,b'6k1/5ppp/1p6/p1bp4/P5P1/2P4P/3NKP2/8 b - -',Seeing the 3-2 pawn advantage black has and trying to get over to the queenside to defend.
212,4,37,3f6,b'6k1/6pp/1p3p2/p1bp4/P5P1/2P4P/3NKP2/8 w - -',Slowly pushing up and wanting to get my king to e6 to re-evaluate his own intentions.
213,4,38,3c4,b'8/6pp/1p2kp2/p1bp4/P1P2PP1/3K3P/3N4/8 b - -',White throws all of chips in the pot and attacks. I'm guessing he was counting on getting his king to b5 after exchanging the remaining minor pieces and hopefully winning the race to promote his a pawn before I could get my king behind his remaining pawns.
214,4,39,4Kxc4,b'8/6pp/1p2kp2/p1b5/P1K2PP1/7P/3N4/8 b - -',Correct. My opponent now aims to exchange his knight for my bishop by Ne4 or Nb3.
215,4,40,4f5,b'8/6pp/1p2k3/p1b2p2/P1K2PP1/7P/3N4/8 w - -',! Strong. The intent here was to busy my opponent with his plans on the queenside while my king started gobbling up any further impediments on the kingside so a pawn could be promoted.
216,4,41,4Nf3,b'8/6pp/1p2k3/p1b2p2/P1K2PP1/5N1P/8/8 b - -',White realizes my plan.......
217,4,42,h6,b'8/6p1/1p2k2p/p1b5/P1K2PP1/5N2/8/8 w - -',I tell myself that this is gonna be slow steady advancement.
218,4,43,4Nd4+,b'8/6p1/1p2k2p/p1b5/P1KN1PP1/8/8/8 b - -',? This move loses for white. After exchanging pieces black wins the race to promotion.
219,4,44,h5,b'8/8/1p3kp1/p2K3p/P4PP1/8/8/8 w - -',And white resigned. I had approximately 15 conditional responses locked in and realized that white could not stop promotion. This game WORE ME OUT:) but was very enjoyable.

It may seem a bit odd but in retrospect black's best defensive piece is now his king and he has a way to go to get over to the action. Both of black's bishops are weak and the time needed to get a knight to b7 then to a5 (getting behind me) is just far too great. Black digs in and hopes to win back the pawn he lost earlier by doubling up his attack on one of my pawns. Which one at this point is still unclear to me.

I lost quickly in an old stodgy Italian Game position.  Here again in the 6th and final round I am about to lose to Jeff a second time in pretty much the same fashion.  I do however last a little longer choking in 20 moves instead of 19.  Only this time I come much closer to victory with correct strategy!

398,13,2,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Controlling the center with two pawns is natural and is really the acid test of 1.e4 Nc6.  The alternate 2.Nf3 is played frequently by strong players intending to either switch back into known Double KP theory or simply get a slightly better position with more space after 2...d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 followed by White developing naturally behind his pawn center.  After 2.d4 Black must decide immediately on a central pawn break: 2...d5 or 2...e5.
399,13,3,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Although Black is fine in the locked center positions resulting from 2...e5 3.d5 White can transpose into Scotch territory after 2...e5 3.Nf3.  Recalling Jeff's splendid play in a normal Double KP position from our previous encounter in 2002 I did not wish to give him that option and instead chose Nimzowitsch's original idea of 2...d5.

402,13,6,c3,b'r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Obviously concerned about a possible ...Nb4 at some point White chooses to blunt the Queen Knight and at the same time nail down the d4 pawn creating a cramping pawn chain.  The c3 pawn can later be used to launch a queenside pawn storm with b2-b4 if Black castles long.
403,13,7,Qd7,b'r3kbnr/pppqpppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Although we're still in theory there is something aesthetically pleasing when after only 4 moves you have 3 pieces developed and your opponent has zero!

Here it's even more effective since the early Nf3 blocks the f-pawn.  Ideally White would like to support e5 with f2-f4 but often White makes this concession for the sake of rapid kingside development.  Black's 5...f6 is well-timed here.

Instead Black captures away from the center opens the e-file and leaves the kingside pawns connected.  White has already lost the opening battle stumbling into a French Exchange position where Black is up two tempi.

In a normal French Exchange opposite-side castling position White counters with standard queenside expansion via the pawn pushes b2-b4 and a2-a4 keeping Black on his toes.  Here instead of counterattacking White must play careful defense as a consequence of his mistake on Move 6.

It took me some time to find it over the board as it moves a piece twice before finishing development.  But the Bishop now creates an annoying pin on the f3 Knight and sets up potential tactics so its second movement is fully justified.
413,13,17,1hxg5,b'2k1rbnr/pppq4/2n2p2/3p2Pp/3P2b1/2P2NB1/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',A horrible blunder!  White was obviously anticipating 12...fxg5 so he could mount his Knight on e5 trade some pieces and try to neutralize the attack.  But this capture only fuels the fire allowing the h-pawn to roll.  Resistance is NOT futile after 12.Re1 which unpins the Knight and aids development.  Now the attack is unstoppable.  Realizing his mistake White sighed and shook his head as I played...

White will then need to decide whether to allow his King's position to be ripped open or to entomb his dark-squared Bishop with 14.g3.  Both choices seem undesirable.
416,13,20,1h3,b'2k1rbnr/pppq4/2n2p2/3p2P1/3P1Bb1/2P2N1p/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',"In the actual game I played 13...Re4? which puts the Rook on a vulnerable square and does not assist in opening up White's King.  In a few moves I went ape with an unsound exchange sacrifice along with dropping two pawns.  Black was left with dust in the wind and was forced to resign on Move 20.

But what if the text move (13...h3!) had actually been played?  It seems like such a natural way to continue the attack.  In opposite-side castling positions use your pawns!  How many times have I heard that?  The only reason I did not play ...h3 immediately was because I visualized White bypassing with the g-pawn and sliding his King under the h-pawn for defense.  But the text is definitely Black's strongest continuation.  Let's see what could have happened."

Objectively White's best here is 15.Kg2 allowing the 15...Bh3  skewer.  15.Nxh2 is obviously worse on account of 15...Bxe2 winning the house.  But the move that most players would probably choose here is the natural 15.Kh1 blocking and using the h-pawn as a shield.  And now...

The combination involves 6 key players all of which are perfectly aligned: 1) The c6 Knight 2) The g4 Bishop 3) The Black Queen 4) The Rook on e8 5) The Rook on h8 and 6) The macho h2 Pawn.  Black will now show White the true meaning of the Dark Side of The Force!

If he'd developed his knight instead of that odd odd move 12 this could be a totally different game.  But I see the attack through the d-pawn and start dialing in on it.

First the bishop is easier to rescue when it eventually gets overwhelmed.  Second with white's dark bishop gone my dark bishop becomes more valuable.

I had to break my other bishop free and get my knight into the game.  My goal was to get my bishop on c6 and my knight on d7.  I strongly considered d5 here taking the material loss to gain position but I didn't like the freedom it left the white e/d pawn.  d6 does just as much to free my pieces and doesn't give away material or position.

The problem is that if white is only looking to exchange queens (which is the only thing that makes sense) then Qxb6 begets axb6 leaving me with doubled pawns on the b rank.
I next considered Qc6 which has the same effect but leaves me with an intact pawn structure.  The problem with this move though is that it leaves my queen-side pawns badly underrepresented and it doesn't do any actual development.
Finally I came to Nd6 which defends my king and queen but doesn't challenge the white queen.  Now the effect of Qxb6 is Nxb6 leaving me well balanced and better developed.  As an added bonus if white gets cold feet about the trade I have the following possibility:
11. ... Bf2 
12. Ke2 Qe3 
13. Kd1 Qe1  
At worst it gives white something more to worry about."

I also like it because it lines me up to pin the knight most likely trading and doubling white's queen-side pawns.  With a one-pawn lead and much better structure if I can push white just a little further over the edge I expect to win in the end game.

My knight and dark bishop are well positioned to stir up some trouble but I have nothing to back them up.  I need to get the rooks into play.  That means castling and getting the white bishop off the back rank.  Since the only interesting move white had was Bc4  I decided to start with the bishop.

Instead of waiting until I have a clear advantage I make speculative attacks.  This is one of those cases.  I didn't want to give white the chance to get his act together so I attacked before I was completely ready.
655,24,25,1Nb5,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/3pp3/1Nb5/n3P3/P5P1/1PPN3P/3RKB1R b Kkq -',Because of my impatient move white is given the chance to hang me on my uncastled king.  The danger here is two-fold.  First Nc7  forks my rook.  Second Bxb5 Bxb5  wins my knight.

The only sensible move for white is Rb1 relieving the stress on my d pawn and forcing me to retreat or protect the knight.  Rd2 looses the rook to Be3 and capturing with either knight results in a material or positional loss.
Alternative: 16. Nb3 Bc6 17. Nxd6 Rf-d8 18. Nxc5 Nxc5 19. Bg2 leaving white finally able to castle and in a generally stronger position."
659,24,29,Na4,b'r4rk1/pp1b1ppp/3pp3/1Nb5/n3P3/PN4P1/2P4P/1R2KB1R w K -',By retreating I defend my dark bishop and I prepare to further harry the rook.  At this point I'm looking for Rd1 Bxb5 Bxb5 Nc3 forking the rook bishop and e pawn.

661,24,31,1Nxc5,b'r4rk1/pp1b1ppp/3pp3/1Nn5/4P3/P5P1/2P4P/1R2KB1R w K -',I take with the knight because I like my d pawn where it is and because I want to pressure the white e pawn.  The natural response is Bd3 defending the pawn and (hopefully) opening the path for a king-side castle.
662,24,32,1Nxd6,b'r4rk1/pp1b1ppp/3Np3/2n5/4P3/P5P1/2P4P/1R2KB1R b K -',White instead opts to try to recover the pawn.

664,24,34,Bc6,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2b1p3/8/4N3/P5P1/2P4P/1R2KB1R w K -',White has taken my knight but now this pin will result in him losing his.  The net result is that I keep my 2-pawn lead and wipe out the white center.
665,24,35,2Bd3,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/2b1p3/8/4N3/P2B2P1/2P4P/1R2K2R b K -',White decides to dig deeper meaning this pin will probably trigger the last big piece exchange of the game.

667,24,37,2Nf2,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/2b1p3/5p2/8/P2B2P1/2P2N1P/1R2K2R b K -',White opts to trade his rook for my knight and bishop.  It's an interesting choice.  On the one hand he trades an inactive rook for my very active bishop and knight.  On the other hand white's center is gone and he's just stranded his king in the middle of the board.  White has also recovered the point lost when I took his e pawn but it's just a point not a pawn.  To my way to figuring this move was weak.
668,24,38,2Bxh1,b'r4rk1/pp4pp/4p3/5p2/8/P2B2P1/2P2N1P/1R2K2b w - -',When white claims my bishop I am left defending the b pawn from the rook and the e pawn from the bishop.

676,24,46,2Kf6,b'2r2r2/p6p/1p2pk2/1R3pp1/8/P2BN1P1/2P4P/4K3 w - -',Bad move.  Kg6 would have been worlds better.  My worry with Kg6 was that it pins my f pawn to my king which I was certain would cause problems later.  Instead I opted to cause problems for myself immediately by blocking my rook's defense of the f pawn.
677,24,47,2a4,b'2r2r2/p6p/1p2pk2/1R3pp1/P7/3BN1P1/2P4P/4K3 b - -',White tips his hand.  He's looking to take out my a and b pawns.

My other alternative was Rg-d8 but seeing as I just put the rook where it was that seemed wasteful.  It was now time to throw some resources behind what I started.  Advancing the h pawn just strengthens the upcoming pawn assault.
At this point I started doing the math.  If I can trade off enough of the remaining pawns swap rooks and trade my rook for the knight or bishop I can get a draw if worse comes to worse.  My backup plan is now Rc5 to trade rooks."

688,25,1,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Scotch Gambit.  Here Black has two main moves transposing into known systems: 1) 4...Nf6 Two Knights Defense and 2) 4...Bc5 Giuoco Piano.  All other moves are weaker.
689,25,2,Bb4+,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Bishop check nets a pawn but Black must tread softly on thin ice in order to achieve a tenable position as there are several possible ways for White to obtain a clear advantage.  The counterattacking Two Knights Defense and solid Giuoco Piano offer Black a much better game.
690,25,3,dxc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bB1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Here 6.O-O is possible since 6...cxb2 7.Bxb2 gives White the ominous-looking Horwitz Bishops in a Danish Gambit position.  I prefer 6.bxc3 as it only gambits one pawn and forces Black to do something with his b4 Bishop.
691,25,4,bxc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"Black now has several continuations:
1) 6...Bf8? undevelops the Bishop.  That can't be good.

3) 6...Bd6? blocks in Black's own pieces.
4) 6...Bc5? allows White a clear advantage after 7.Bxf7  Kxf7 8.Qd5  followed by Qxc5 and Black cannot castle.
5) 6...Ba5 is the only real try but White gets a strong position after 7.O-O.
6) 6...Qf6 is an interesting try but White can force matters with 7.Bg5 Bxc3  8.Kf1! Bxa1 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.e5! Bd8 (leaving e7 open for a Knight) 11.Qd5 Nh6.  Although Black is ahead in material with a position that's somewhat difficult to attack White does enjoy the Queen better development and control of the center.  White is slightly better.  I had Fritz 10 play both sides of this position and White eventually won with an accurately-played kingside attack."

694,25,7,Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnppp/2nb4/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A question mark.  The Black Queen is suffocating behind her pieces.  A better try would be 7...Qf6 and then ...Nge7 (similar to the main line of The Scotch Game) since Black is OK after 8.Bg5 Qg6.  Now White gets a powerful initiative!
695,25,8,Ng5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnppp/2nb4/6N1/2B1P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Without a Knight on f6 it's much easier for White to attack the kingside.

Bb7 or 11. ... c6! more commonly but Nf6 is also a very strong (and my preferred) move.
803,32,8,1Re1,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p4n2/1p6/8/1BP5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',Anticipating black's 12. ... Bd6.  12. d4 and 12. Re2 are also worth considering as defensive options but 12. Re2 would block the queen's defensive route to the kingside.

It is possible that Re2 would have been better back on the 12th move saving white a tempo but getting in the way of 14. Qf3.  As an aside some say that 16. Bd2 is an even better move for white.  My analysis is that in that case Ng4! for black looks excellent.  16. Bd2 Ng4 17. g3 Qxh3 18. Qxa8 Bxg3 and black has sacrificed a rook for a tremendous kingside assault.
811,32,16,1Bg4,b'r4rk1/2p2ppp/p2b4/1p6/3P2bq/1BP2Q1P/PP2RnP1/RNB3K1 w - -',A difficult move in a difficult position.  I honestly don't know what move I'd make here as 16. ... Bxh3 and 16. ... Nxh3  don't look too inviting either and 16. ... Bg3? is checkmate (16. ... Bg3 17. Qxf7 ! Rxf7 18. Re8#)

826,32,31,Bd6,b'4rrk1/5ppp/p2b4/1p1B4/1P4P1/2P2Q2/P1KB2P1/RN4q1 w - -',Not a great looking move but again it's hard to see what could've been better.  Marshall has played excellently and it's hard to find an improvement.  But Capablanca was just a little bit better.  (Of course he was just a little bit better than *everybody*.)

That Rf8 is doing nothing while all of white's pieces are ready for an attack.  Maybe black's plan was to exchange as much as possible?

838,33,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',4.Bg5 is an older way of playing but is equally as good.

841,33,5,a3,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1n1p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/P1N1BN2/1PPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',White does not panic but simply prevents black from pushing too far forward (i.e 9.Bd3 b4 10.Nd1 c4 11.Be2 Nb6 and Black has an excellent game).  Again 9.dxc5 (an impulse move though far fom bad) feels to me as though it takes much of the tension out of the game.

855,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"So in this annotation I'm - hopefully - telling you something useful about the theory of French defence and especially the classical variation. This is a miniature game that includes a routine kingside attack and some use of GK database. French defence is known as an opening that is fairly problem-free and simple to play for black. Many people do not study it as much as other openings and now I'm going to show that it might be dangerous; French defence is not that simple for black as many seem to think.

Partly becouse I use database I have to admit that I don't know that much about the openings. Though I know something about the theory the knowledge has mostly allocated through experience. That's why there might be mistakes in this analysis so don't be afraid to correct me. You can send me a private message via gameknot if you disagree with me."
856,34,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',First of all I don't play French defence as black so my level of knowledge might be fairly poor for that reason too. I've played against French only a couple of times but I see already that there are these frequent themes that keep coming especially in the classical variation.
857,34,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I have no idea how much my opponent has played this opening. Those who play French often use it a lot becouse it is so universal. But if it's the only opening in your openings book against 1.e4 then you really should spend some time with it.
858,34,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"So this is the move that I currently favor. Other ideas are exd5 (exchange variation) and e5 (advance variation). The problem with the exd5 is that it often leads into drawish positions. Move e5 is in use today but the idea to make black's position narrow doesn't really work. You see it pretty often but black has very good brakethrough opportunities mainly the instant c5 (Steinitz variation). 

Then there is Nd2 which leads into various French Tarrash lines. I haven't really played them but this move is fairly popular now and is considered as a good option. But if I've understood correctly this Tarrash variation theory is actually an real art on its own. There are a lot of other options too but the classical (Nc3) is the most popular."
859,34,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',"I use only GameKnot openings database as I play and in this point it seems as if white had an advantage. Almost all moves favour white by at least 5 percent. But that's not the reason why a really like to see this move. Nf6 is logical but I feel that white can pretty easily achieve a problem-free position where both sides have attacking changes on the sides while center remains closed. This is of course usual in all French variations but in classical variation I feel that white often gains more mobility and has a slight edge in development. 

If black want's to make things tricky for me Bb4 (the most popular choice the Winawer defence)) can do the thing. The result is often white's advantage in space (next move is often e5) against black's queenside pawnrush. It's not simple for white to exploit his space in center to develop an attack. The pin itself can be very annoying too and black can mess white's pawn structure but it's not clear whether it turns out to be any real weakness."
860,34,5,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Not any real options here except 4. e5 which has the point after 4.- Nf-d7 to go for a straight attack with 5. f4. Black has the usual c5 -counter again.
861,34,6,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',"This is the most popular and a logical answer. Sometimes unexperienced players freak out in this point (Oh god my knight is pinned gotta get that bishop away!"") and play something crazy like h6 which causes weaknesses in 4.-h6 5. Bh4 that gets just worse in 5.- g5 6. Bg3 after which the bishop is just great aiming to move in square e5. If for example 6.- dxe4 7. Be5 then it's not clear whether the extra pawn can be defended or whether it's even worth it But it might be playable though.

A real option is Bd4 which leads into very double-edged situations. 4.- Bb4 5. e5 h6 6. exf6 hxg5 7. fxg7 Rg8 is a well-known line which is advantageous for black. White can however settle with 6. Bd2 or 6. Be3 which both -apperently - favor white. The move dxe4 is can also be played which seems pretty equal after 4.- dxe4 5. Nxe4 Be7."
862,34,7,e5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',This is by far the best option.
863,34,8,Qxe7,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I wonder if someone has tried 6.- Kxe7?!?!
864,34,9,f4,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq f3',Move f4 is thematic for white in many French variations. It's a direct attacking move which must be done before bringing the g1-knight to f3. Nb5 here is gaining popularity but for me it seem a bit too sloppy. 
865,34,10,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQ -',"So here black has two real options a6 and 0-0. I can't totally understand this a6 move for black in French but it does two things: it stops white knight (and bishop) from coming to b5 and aids the following queenside pawn attack (black can then play b5 after c5). But the thing is that the white bishop is excellent in d3 and the queenside attack is coming without a6 too so I can't quite see the point. Of course it's useful not to allow the knight in b5 but if white didin't play it on the last move that it's not likely to be a threath before c5 comes.

If you go with a6 then you'll end up having your king in the center for a while becouse the point (7.- a6 8. Nf3 O-O is clearly worse for black) of a6 is to play c5 next. It seems playble for me though; 7.- a6 8. Nf3 c5 9. dxc5 Nc6 is a classical French situation where it's all about who's going faster. Instant c5 here is definetly premature becouse of Nb5 so I would castle here as black too."
866,34,11,Nf3,b'rnb2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Here you can see white doing something weird Qd2. I think queen should be left to d1 becouse you can't yet know where you should place her. In d1 she is ready to go to h5 g4 or d3. Nf3 is a very confident all-round choice in my apinion.
867,34,12,a6,b'rnb2rk1/1ppnqppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',"I give this move ?! becouse it seems to me that this is the reason for black's defeat. I'm pretty sure that there is a way to survive after this but the correct move was definetly c5. I quess that people are quite afraid of white playing 9. Nb5 in return but now that the black king is safe it actually isn't that big of an issue. 8.- c5 9. Nb5 a6 10. Nd6 isn't nice for black but it's by no means over. In the event of 10.- cxd4 11. Nxd4 f6 12. Qg4 it's not that easy for white to exloit his advantage. Black also has an alternative 9.- Nc6 but I'm not sure whether it's better. 10.c3 gives white a very solid position. 

White also has other moves 9. dxc5 and 9. Qd2. In the latter option black has a very solid 9.- Nc6. In case of 9. dxc5 black can also play 9.- Nc6 but white does have the advantage even after black recaptures in 10. Qd2 Qxc5. This is why 9. dxc5 is tempting and 9. Nb5 might not happen."
868,34,13,Bd3,b'rnb2rk1/1ppnqppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ -',The only played continuation GK database. Directly aims to the h7 pawn. After this all variations have only been played less than 10 times in GK database so notice now that my explanations could go fault.

In 9.- f6 10. exf6 Nxf6 white's central pawns seem kind of scattered. White propably has to settle for 9.- 0-0 which seems very equal. The move also has some shock effect; white was going for a kingside attack but but after f6 black's the one with kingside initiative.

9.- h6? won't propably quite do the trick. The pawn offers an excellent target for white's attacks (both pawn advances and piece sacrifices) although 10. Qe2?! doesn't seem to be the way to go. Qd2 can be tried but for me it seems best to keep the queen in place to castle instead (10. 0-0) and see what black does. Only then white can determine where the queen should be developed."

10.- Kxh7 is a very interesting (and fairly well-known) variation. The logical way for white to go is Ng5 . Black king has two places to go (Kh/g8 leads into a mate after Qh5 of course) g6 and h6. 11.- Kh6 loses quickly for 12.Qd3 after which white has far to many mating threaths. Black can sac his rook to avoid getting mated (12.- Rh8 13. Qh3  Kg6 14. Qxh8) but white has then won enough material to win. This sac is thematical in French classical variation and most of the time black can survive if correct moves are played.

11.- Kg6! is the critical variation. There white has no straight win if black plays correctly. When white plays the obvious 12. Qd3  black has a suprising 12.- f5!. White is an exchange up in 13. Qh3 Nf6 14. exf6 Kxf6 15. Nh7  Kf7 16. Nxf8 Qxf8 but it might not be that simple to convert it into a victory.

White can also play in a risky way with 13. exf6 e.p.  Kxf6 and then choose not to take the exchange. White is then two pawns down but has a great attacking changes. An clear idea might be to build a pin agains the queen in the central lines with moves 0-0 Rf-e1 and then utilize it with Nxd5. Black can propably survive but it won't be simple for him."

881,34,26,1Bxg6,b'r1b1qr2/1p1n2k1/p1n1p1B1/2ppP1N1/3P1P2/2NQ4/PPP3P1/R3K2R b KQ -',"Now that queen's threathened only sensible move is Qxg6 which leads into mate in Rh7  Qxh7 Qxh7X. Otherwise black's queen is lost and that's why she resiqned.

So here's some points about the game and French classical variation in general:

- The move 4. -Nf6 is playble for black but make sure you take a look at other alternatives as well.

- Decide whether you want to invest time for a6 -move or go for the straight c5 as black.  If you don't do a6 make sure your king is safe first. Black should propably castle early.

- White should not hurry with castling. Sometimes in French white king castles queenside (to throw all the kingside pawns into an attack) and sometimes he might stay in the center (becouse those pawn chains that often exist in the French make it safe).

- White should not hurry with queen deployment either. See first where she is at her best and move her there.

Lastly I just wanna tell that in this kind of position database is very useful. Many players use it here and if you don't then that's your own choice but remember that you're giving your opponent some free advantage. The reason why I use just the GK database is that I don't want it to make everything for me. GK base won't win the games for you but with it you're likely to avoid the most common opening traps and get a playable middlegame position. If you haven't studied that much openings theory then the database is definetly the way to go. In corresponde chess databases basicly frees you from studying openings theory but you still have to make sure that you understand the ideas behind the openings. 

So in my opinion using the database makes the corresponde chess a bit funnier than OTB chess becouse you don't have to spend hours learning opening lines. Of course you don't have to learn all the openings from heart to play OTB but the lines are still more important than in corresponde where you can use database. But I want to make it very clear that "

Additionally this move keeps his queen off the A6-F1 diagonal for now
