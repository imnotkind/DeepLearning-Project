139,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In this game I was holding DJ for most of the game. Then my greed gets the better of me I take a poisoned pawn and it is quickly lost.
140,2,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I play my usual Sicilian
141,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He plays the usual
142,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',and I follow the main line
143,2,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',What is this? is he intending a closed variation after all?

148,2,9,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And we reach the usual position
149,2,10,Bb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is slightly unusual Bg5 Bc4 and Be2 are more common

158,2,19,1a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/1B6/4P3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',a6 is often a move played in the Open Sicilian. Here I can play it with tempo.
159,2,20,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/8/4P3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He retreats
160,2,21,1b5,b'r2q1rk1/3bppbp/p1np1np1/1p6/4P3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - b6',Qa5 was the move played in the only other game on the Gameknot opening databases (ojdol (2167) vs. janhalpha (2323) - drawn in 32 moves. This move seemed more thematic - pursuing a minority attack against the white queen side.
161,2,22,1a3,b'r2q1rk1/3bppbp/p1np1np1/1p6/4P3/P1NBBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He prevents b5-b4

178,2,39,2Rec8,b'1rr3kb/2q1pp1p/p1bp1npB/6N1/1Pp1PQ2/P1N4P/2PR1PP1/5RK1 w - -',I improve the standing of my other rook. Now if I can distract him on the centre and/or queen side his Bh6 may proof to be misplaced.

186,2,47,2axb4,b'1rr3kb/2q1pp1p/3p1npB/3P2N1/1p1R1Q2/P1p4P/2P2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',So I take

220,3,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Russ a relative beginner asked me to play him and annotate the game for him to help him see where he went wrong. I am happy to help him.
221,3,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',So this is the Reti opening
222,3,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This transposes bak into mainline queen's pawn opening.
223,3,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I opt for symmetry
224,3,4,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And this is leading it back more towards the Reti it started out. c2-c4 would lead to the Queen's Gambit.
225,3,5,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',His bishop is heading for g2 and this blocks its action
226,3,6,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',so he completes the manoeuvre
227,3,7,Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I decide to develop possibly following up with e7-e6 and my Bc8 is developed outside my pawn chain.
228,3,8,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NPP/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Post match computer analysis (PMCA) doesn't give this as an error but I would. Why not simply 0-0 immediately?
229,3,9,Qc8,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NPP/PPP1PPB1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So I play this to stop 0-0. I play the queen to c8 rather than d7 so it cannot be attacked by Nf3-e5
230,3,10,O-O,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NPP/PPP1PPB1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',but he plays it anyway. It just gives up a pawn.
231,3,11,Bxh3,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/5NPb/PPP1PPB1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I take
232,3,12,Ng5,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2N1/3P4/6Pb/PPP1PPB1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',He attacks my bishop
233,3,13,Bxg2,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2N1/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPb1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',So I take
234,3,14,Kxg2,b'rnq1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2N1/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPK1/RNBQ1R2 b kq -',He takes back
235,3,15,Qf5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1qN1/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPK1/RNBQ1R2 w kq -',I attack the knight. Now it is my queen I want to develop outside the pawn chain.

Qxf5 exf5 13. Rh1 Bb4 14. Bd2 O-O 15. Nf3 Rfe8 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 as best for both sides. I'm not sure why it gives this rather than either side exchanging queens and weakening the opponent's pawn formation.

Normally I would refute this move with 2...g6 or 2...Nf6 to punish black for not developing properly.  However I know what his intentions are in this position.  And I will allow it in order to learn from what's about to come.

While one can argue that this move does not develop anything it can be said that in this position my goal is to control the center.  I start with this move because it advances a central pawn one step further.  According to different commentators they have previously implied central pawns have to be advanced a little further to control center.  Because central pawns are the main aspects of central control and I remembered that with this move.  In addition my main goal is to exchange but this is black's first mistake according to my opponent. That's because he said ""well actually i wanted to tell you after your next move. that it took you about 5 moves to give away all the advantage i gave you. back to me.""  The problem here is that I miscalculated.  I told my opponent that aside from analyze the board I often get the facts wrong by miscalculating.

so actually you can say to take is a mistake.""  And his advice was ""Tip: try not to win in your upcoming new games just try to last as long as possible. And ignore most of the moves from your opponents ( or in short play your own game )""  "
310,5,14,Bc4,b'rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/8/2pq4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',But white has plans of his own.  In this position he decides to attack my Q by pinning it to the K. 
311,5,15,Qxc4,b'rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/8/2p5/2q5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',?? At first I seemed nervous and asked my self what could be done in this position.  Then I figured out the answer.  It is feasible take his LSB since he left it vulnerable.  Before making this move I asked myself if he had a good reason for doing this.  The reason is that sometimes your opponent has a good reason for doing this.  I learned it the hard way in a couple of my past games.  After looking the position however I figured out that this is just a blunder.  He blundered it away or so it seemed.  So I decided to take it immediately.  That's because it appears that there are no threats in this position.  However he has something to hide so this move is an outright blunder.  The reason being is that this move will allow white to win back his Q after 9.Ne5+.
312,5,16,Ke8,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2p1pp/8/2p1N3/2q5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I had different feasibility's.  But for several reasons this is the best move for black.  As noted earlier however he is about to get something back.
313,5,17,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2p1pp/8/2p2b2/2N5/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',At this point my goal is to continue with development.  But he is already far ahead in this process.
314,5,18,1d3,b'rn2kb1r/pp2p1pp/8/2p2b2/2N5/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',In this postion he intends to develop his DSB.  Also feasible was 11.b3 but I think that this move is better.
315,5,19,1Nc6,b'r3kb1r/pp2p1pp/2n5/2p2b2/2N5/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',That however is not going to delay me from developing.  I decided that since I'm behind in the process that I would start by getting as many pieces out as I can at once.
316,5,20,1Bf4,b'r3kb1r/pp2p1pp/2n5/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This is how he develops his piece.  He also had other places to put it but for some reason I like this move the best.
317,5,21,1e6,b'r3kb1r/pp4pp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',In this position however I am also determined to develop my B.  So I decide to follow what white did on move 11.
318,5,22,1O-O-O,b'r3kb1r/pp4pp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',"He also could have castled Kingside and in my opinion that would have been better.  Of course however I am the kind of person that often likes to castle short because that is what I was originally taught.  The only problem with that is that myevilluck the former mentor for the ""Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run"" club told me that you can't play a move just because that's how you were taught.  On the one hand I agree with his assessment because it's a bad idea to make a move without having a good reason for doing so.  On the other hand some of what he told me is void and invalid because he is no longer my mentor for the club.  It really depends on what therealjimfriar has to say since he is the current for the same club."
319,5,23,1Be7,b'r3k2r/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',"In the meantime my development is pretty much complete.  The only thing to figure out is what way I plan to castle and if it's feasible to do so.  At this point however Fred said ""to easy"".  At first I thought he was asking if I thought that it was easy.  I told him that it seems extremely easy but the answer is no.  That is because has repeatedly said ""It's not so easy"".  And that statement was reiterated by GM Judit Polgar in her commentary for the Alkehine tournament and a different video where she defeats Grandmaster Karpov.  However he then clarified by stating ""lol no this is easy for me""."
320,5,24,1f3,b'r3k2r/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P1P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',I do not know why he moved here.
321,5,25,1Kf7,b'r6r/pp2bkpp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B2/3P1P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',In this position I wanted to bring the Rooks together with the King behind so it is about King safety.  However better was to do the thing that I'm obsessed castle.  I cannot believe that I forgot to do this.
322,5,26,1h4,b'r6r/pp2bkpp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B1P/3P1P2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - h3',I still do not know what he intends to do in this position.  
323,5,27,1Rhf8,b'r4r2/pp2bkpp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2B1P/3P1P2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - -',In the meantime I start the process of King safety as mentioned earlier.
324,5,28,1g4,b'r4r2/pp2bkpp/2n1p3/2p2b2/2N2BPP/3P1P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - g3',But he decides to kick my bishop.
325,5,29,1e5,b'r4r2/pp2bkpp/2n5/2p1pb2/2N2BPP/3P1P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',? On the other hand I decide to do the same thing to his B.  Unfortunately I get distracted and miss the threat.  If I had looked more carefully I would have seen the threat.  As it turns this loses a pawn after he places me in check.  That's because after 17.Nxe5+ it will not be possible for me to retake because if then 17...Nxe5?? 18.Bxe5 losing a piece for a pawn. 
326,5,30,Kg8,b'r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2p1Nb2/5BPP/3P1P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - -',Despite the mistake this is the move that I had been planning to play 14...Kf7.  Now that everything is in tact I am completely developed.  However the interesting factor is that we will be exchanging during the next couple of moves.  The only disadvantage is that I am behind a pawn.  
327,5,31,2Rde1,b'r5k1/p3b1pp/2p5/2p2r2/5B1P/3P1P2/PPP5/2K1R2R b - -',? For some reason he decides to attack my DSB but I am not bothered by it.  Instead I view this move as a mistake because we are about to exchange material.  This time however after we exchange I will win a pawn back so that everything is even again.  Therefore I believe that black is no longer at a disadvantage.  Let's see how long this lasts.
328,5,32,2Rc7,b'r5k1/p1R3pp/2p5/2p5/7P/3P1r2/PPP5/2K4R b - -',However I miscalculated something important.  Since those pawns are doubled he decides to attack one of them.  Which means that he is about to win a back and there is nothing that I can do about it.  This is the disadvantage of having doubled and now we all know why I make a big deal out of these things.  There might be more to chess then this but this type of situation can make a big difference in a game.  And this is the logic behind it.
329,5,33,2Raf8,b'5rk1/p1R3pp/2p5/2p5/7P/3P1r2/PPP5/2K4R w - -',Knowing that the pawn is lost anyway I decide to double up my rooks.  That's because doubled rooks can be extremely dangerous as I have repeatedly mentioned in other annotations.
330,5,34,Rf3f7,b'5rk1/R4rpp/2p5/2p5/7P/3P4/PPP5/2K4R w - -',So at this point my goal is to put pressure on the seventh rank.  The other story is that I want to confine his position but unfortunately the plan is not going to work.
331,5,35,2Ra5,b'5rk1/5rpp/2p5/R1p5/7P/3P4/PPP5/2K4R b - -',That's because the joke is now on me.  With this he is automatically going to win my c5 pawn as mentioned on move 25.
332,5,36,2Rf7f1+,b'5rk1/6pp/2p5/R1p5/7P/3P4/PPP5/2K2r1R w - -',But that does not stop me from placing him in check.  In addition this move forces a rook exchange.  The goal is to delay his plan for as long as possible.  Not only that but I want to get as many pieces off the board as possible.  That's because I still have a fight in me and am willing to do battle until the end.
333,5,37,2Kd2,b'6k1/6pp/2p5/R1p5/7P/3P4/PPPK4/5r2 b - -',"Forced and that is exactly what I wanted so one of my goals worked.  I really wanted to force into making a certain move as it's psychological.  If he is forced to do something I generally hope that my opponents get overworked and hand over the advantage.  Usually that's how it happens and it has caused me to pull a swindle in a couple of past games.  By this I'm alluding to a victory in a lost position.  Of course the Master Mater is not going to get stressed over a forced move but it still proves that I'm no where near ready to resign yet.  That's because when I first joined the site and for the first few years I used to resign in this kind of position.  In fact I gave up as soon as I gave up something like a pawn.  That's when Jack Stockel has repeatedly said ""Don't give up right away.  Start thinking."""
334,5,38,2Rf5,b'6k1/6pp/2p5/R1p2r2/7P/3P4/PPPK4/8 w - -',At the last minute I found a different move but it is the only move that protects my c pawn.  However things are about to take an interesting turn as we will see shortly.
335,5,39,2Ra6,b'6k1/6pp/R1p5/2p2r2/7P/3P4/PPPK4/8 b - -',Because of this move I have to think of a way to protect c6.  As it turns out 27...Rf6 is the only way to do it.
336,5,40,2a4,b'6k1/6pp/R1p2r2/2p5/P6P/3P4/1PPK4/8 b - a3',At first I had no idea why he played but as it turns out his intentions are to promote.  As we will see later on this is the pawn that will become a Q.  However it makes perfect sense because in the past Jack Stockel has repeatedly told me that one of the best ways to promote a pawn is by bringing it directly behind the R.  By this I am alluding to the same file so directly vertical from one another.  
337,5,41,2h6,b'6k1/6p1/R1p2r1p/2p5/P6P/3P4/1PPK4/8 w - -',In the meantime I am also determined promote and win his h pawn at the same time.  28...Rh6 was also possible but it certainly would not have been more useful then this move.  If I had been able to ...RxP white would respond with RXP so that move would not have accomplished anything.  This move however achieves very little.  The only useful thing are that the pawns are connected which usually brings you a step closer to promotion.  That's what I thought.  In fact I wrongly assumed that this was a passed pawn and that I could just move my way by sliding these pawns together (e.g ...h5 ...g6) and vica versa.  However the plan is not going to work.  I quickly figured out that he would take one of those pawns and if I were to still attempt a promotion White's King would stop me dead in my tracks.  And I kept that in mind before continuing my attempts.
338,5,42,2a5,b'6k1/6p1/R1p2r1p/P1p5/7P/3P4/1PPK4/8 b - -',Still attempting the promotion.
339,5,43,2g5,b'6k1/8/R1p2r1p/P1p3p1/7P/3P4/1PPK4/8 w - g6',But so am I and in the same way that I had mentioned earlier.  I was hoping for an exchange.  30.hxg5 hxg5.  However I forgot to look at two things.  First I wouldn't get a promotion because of Fred's K.  Second I am not going to get the exchange that I had attempted.
340,5,44,3Rb6,b'6k1/8/1Rp2r1p/P1p3p1/7P/3P4/1PPK4/8 b - -',Instead he brings moves his R to the right.  During the game I had no idea why.  However I figured out the answers afterwards.  This move almost guarantees the promotion because his pawn now has room to make a Q whereas it didn't before.  BTW this is part of the advantage to having your R directly in front of the P.  The only thing that white has to look out for is that I might play ...Rf8.  But a second look shows that it won't be much of a help.  That's because even if I could stop a promotion he would be able to win my f8 R at best.  The logic behind this is that he could simply play Rb8 before I even get the chance to place my Rook on the eighth rank.
341,5,45,3g4,b'6k1/8/1Rp2r1p/P1p5/6pP/3P4/1PPK4/8 w - -',I realize now that I could have taken with 30...gxf5 but that certainly would not stop his plans.  Of course it wins a pawn back but he would certainly get that and then some once he plays a8 =Q.  However I am not quite ready to resign yet.
342,5,46,3Rb8+,b'1R4k1/8/2p2r1p/P1p5/6pP/3P4/1PPK4/8 b - -',This is part of his plan as mentioned earlier.  When I think about it I could have exchanged with 31...Rf8 32.Rxf8 Kxf8.  But it's pointless due to his a pawn.  As implied earlier that's the pawn that will eventually result in my downfall.
343,5,47,3Kg7,b'1R6/6k1/2p2r1p/P1p5/6pP/3P4/1PPK4/8 w - -',So I decide to get out of check with this move.  What gives?   No move is better then the other at this point.
344,5,48,3a6,b'1R6/6k1/P1p2r1p/2p5/6pP/3P4/1PPK4/8 b - -',He' still getting ready to do the inevitable.
345,5,49,3g3,b'1R6/6k1/P1p2r1p/2p5/7P/3P2p1/1PPK4/8 w - -',But I attempt a scheme of my own.  At this point I was hoping and a little optimistic about turning a game into a draw.  The reason being is that when two pawns promote right after each other the game usually ends in a draw.  However that will not be the case with the master mater.  At this point I am just going to have a little more confidence because I can't go wrong by becoming overly confident.  That only happens when you're in a winning position and allow your opponent to pull a swindle by underestimating him or her.  However in the scenario I'm in a losing position so the more confident I am the more I will learn.  As it turns out I'm already learning more about the position then I expected
346,5,50,3a7,b'1R6/P5k1/2p2r1p/2p5/7P/3P2p1/1PPK4/8 b - -',And this is his final step before the Q.
347,5,51,3g2,b'1R6/P5k1/2p2r1p/2p5/7P/3P4/1PPK2p1/8 w - -',But the same can now be said for black.  And we are both about to promote on our next moves.  The only thing is that white still has an overwhelming winning position even after the promotion.  So I just go for brokes but it was well worth the attempt.
348,5,52,3Rg8+,b'Q5R1/6k1/2p2r1p/2p5/7P/3P4/1PPK4/6q1 b - -',That's because of this check.  And I can't get out of it by taking Fred's R due to the promotion.  Not only that but to make matters worse my Q is now pinned due to the R fork that he has.  Therefore when all is said and done white will end up with a Q ahead.  In addition it is the endgame so there's no compensation for what I'm about to lose.  So I resigned on the grounds that any hopes for a swindle are gone.
349,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Don't treat ratings as the be all and end all to be honest I'm over-rated by a good 100 points. On a good streak at the moment thats all. And forget that notion about second best. You're rated 250 points below me and kept pace with me just that final bit that let you down.
350,6,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Standard Ruy Lopez nowt wrong with that I usually go to c4 rather than b5 but thats just personal preference.
351,6,2,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Again personal preference it allows the doubling on the c rank if white is so inclined but I prefer it to the other options.

It supports your hanging pawn on e4 and threatens the c5 pawn(check). A couple of things to always try and rem. Firstly in endgame a pawn advantage is massive try not to let your opponent pick up free pawns secondly you want to be dictating the tempo of the game. Force your opponent to respond to your moves rather than vica versa.

Can't explain why it just seems wrong. Personally I would have played b4 and forced an issue but thats more about playing style I think.
361,6,12,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/2pPp3/1pP2P2/1P2B2P/P2Q2P1/R4RK1 b - f3',Sensible move at the time trying to free up your rook file.

366,6,17,2Rf8,b'5rk1/1p2b1pp/3p4/q1pPp2Q/1pP5/1P2B2P/P5P1/5RK1 w - -',Have to accept the rook and pawn for the rook but still didn't look far enough ahead.

368,6,19,Qxb3,b'8/3Q2p1/3p1bk1/2pPp3/1pP5/1q2B2P/6P1/6K1 w - -',The reason I moved the bishop earlier was to try and tempt you with d6 unfortunately you weren't having it.
369,6,20,g6,b'8/7k/3p1bp1/2pPpQ2/1pP5/1q2B2P/6P1/6K1 w - -',For most of that sequence there was nothing I could do except hop out of the way. You were quite right to offer the draw and in another game I might have taken it. I looked at this variant before but wasn't brave enough to take it. When it cropped up this time I decided to go for it. I figured one move might be enough for me to be able to seize back the tempo. You can repeat the check on d2 but then the h6 escape for the king means you're in the wrong position with the queen. If you take the bishop well you've seen what happens. With hindsight (wonderful thing) you'd have been better off retreating either to f2 or e4 and then bringing your h&g pawns in. e4 is more counter intuitive but it does prevent me rolling up your pawns.
370,6,21,3Kh2,b'8/7k/3p1Qp1/2pPp3/1pP5/4q2P/6PK/8 b - -',And thats the mistake that hands it to me. With a passed pawn advantage to me the last thing you want is to swap the queens off. f1 would have had the same result the only safe place would have been h1 but then that only delays it as I play c1 with the queen forcing you into h2. So its perhaps unfair to call that the mistake rather than Qxb. At the time I looked at this move and crowed mightily but it is (or can be forced) so the mistake has to be the moves before.
371,6,22,exf4,b'8/7k/3p2p1/2pP4/1pP2p2/7P/6PK/8 w - -',Doesn't matter what happens in the f-h files. No way you can now stop the b pawn and then its almost always going to be a losing battle.
372,6,23,b2,b'8/7k/3p2p1/2pP4/2P2p2/7P/1p3KP1/8 w - -',Its been said that chess is a game where the winner makes the second to last mistake. And here that happened to be me. I'm not overly a technical player and if you ask GK for a technical analysis they'll prob say half of the match was errors. From my point of view I see three mistakes. (1) yours leaving a pawn open (2) mine getting over ambitious and having to scurry back to defend (3) yours taking the bishop when retreat was called for. But considering the difference in ratings (flawed as they are) you played fairly even with me throughout most of it and only a rather desperate pawn move to offer the bishop saved me.
373,7,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My sixth game vs bigpeta.  Pete feels I erred right off by not exchanging at move 3.  The gk computer doesn't disagree but only adjusts -.12.  As I write this I haven't analyzed the game at all and do not know exactly where the game really went wrong.  So let's see.
374,7,1,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',I believe this is the first time I've played this opening the Trompowski attack.

Cause of loss was VERY gradual and subtle tracing back to it appears non-optimal moves at 10 and 12. Another factor is Pete's skill at preventing his opponent from developing much of an offense.

So analysts any thoughts on how bigpeta accomplishes this aspect of his method?  Computer disliked exactly none of Pete's moves.  Looking forward to your comments.  Thank you to Pete for playing.

While it develops a piece Mr. Stockel has repedetly told me that 3.d4 is best and the most common response to 2...d6  In fact we kept practicing that together until I was almost blue in the face.  It goes to show you that sometimes it's a good idea for you to get out of your comfort and get used to something that you're not accustomed to.  That's an important lesson that I learned from GM Judit Polgar in the Alkehine Tournament during her commentary.
672,16,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',But two can play that game.  If he can play something that I'm not used to then I can play something that he might not be accustomed to.  In this position we usually exchange where PXP NXP.  Since that did not happen I decided to develop my first piece and as we will see later on I am preparing to castle Queenside this time.  That's because it will be much harder to get the DSB out then my pieces on my other side.
673,16,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',I understand that this move develops another piece so I don't know why white did not play 4.Bb5 instead.  That does the same thing while pinning my N and adding pressure to the c file.

675,16,8,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',?! At first I had the position wrong and originally recorded that white played 5.d6.  But that is not possible for white to make a move like that this early.  It would only be feasible if you were black.  Then I thought that that he played 5.d4.  However I looked at the position and figured out why I recorded the inaccuracy.  As it turns out white only advances his d pawn one square as opposed to two.  That however is an inaccuracy because blocks in his LSB so that he can't pull it back.  Therefore white will have less room to retreat his LSB if it ever should get attacked.  
676,16,9,Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I played this move for two reasons.  First develops another piece and prepares so that I can eventually castle Queenside.  Second my goal was to pin his N and put pressure on the f file and I thought that I took advantage of his inaccuracy.  Because he played 5.d3 it's not feasible for white to break the pin with his LSB and I kept that in mind before playing this move.  So I thought that I knew his weakness and this is important because this same opponent has also repeatedly advised to try and find your opponents weakness in some of my past games against him.  The only problem however is that I overlooked something important.  He can easily break the pin so it's not one of his weaknesses afterall.  He will start by attacking my LSB with 6.h3.
677,16,10,Bh5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p4b/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',But the pin is not going to be broken easily.  Believe it or not I spoke to Jack about 6...Bd7 given that he is eventually going to attack and break the pin with g4.  He said that because I did not make a blunder of placing the N on the rim (did not play ...Nh5) then I can just retreat with this move.  So since I can play this he asked why not move here.  Afterall it is a better retreat and outpost for my B then 6...Bd7.  BTW this is the move that I was going to play anyway but I decided to speak with my opponent about the different possiblilties given that he is my favorite coach. 
678,16,11,O-O,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p4b/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Now my opponent accurately pointed out that there is an immediate threat of 7...Qa5 as it would pin his other N.  I don't see why that is a big deal because he can break it with 6...Bd2 and I am still going to play 7...Qa5 on my next move for a completely different reason.  But he told me that castling Kingside will prevent the pin.  Ok I would have played this move if I were not but not for the same reason.  My goal would just be to castle in order to complete development and while the opportunity excisted.  That's because he and Mr. Arboite a former assistant coach for Mr. Stockel told me that you want to castle before the opportunity is gone.  So the idea is to castle early and often.

And that is with this move.  That's because the same master told me that this is the way to do that in a different opening when we played the QGA.  It's the same idea but in a completely different game variation and context.  However I decided to apply the same idea in this game.  "

But I am going to so something before allowing that.  That's because he is attacking my Q so I will defend it before doing anything else.  Note: This is just another way that he quizzes me.  And this is what that makes his quizzes similar to the Master Mater and in the same way.  He will attack and try to force an exchange while using a different piece to attack attack (to attack and threaten the win of the same piece).  Sometimes it can be very difficult however to see the threat.  But that is sometimes the point because you really have to analyze before making a move.  And this is what Jack Stockel means when he says ""Start thinking"".  If you just make a move without giving it second thought then you will usually wind up paying the ultimate price.  Now had I played ...NXP he would have told me that it would have been a very bad choice because you lose the Q.  I know from past experiences so I looked at ""the picture"" (his real intentions).  And this is what he is trying to get me and his other chess students to do.  He wants to start look at the big picture by seeing his plan and threats associated with it.  So I passed his test with flying color."

However development is the least of blacks problems because if I had moved the Q to a4 then he could automatically win it after 10.b3.  So I kept that in mind by not allowing it in the first place.

In other words I told him that I can either recapture with my Q or my g pawn.  He however told me that this move is better.  Before that happened I considered 10...gxf6 but I was going to play this move anyway as it was my first instinct.  That is because this move will bring me one step closer to castling whereas with the other move my Q still remains undeveloped which delays that.

Now I spoke to him about doing this now or bringing my DSB out and then castling Kingside.  He told me that this move is better.  The reason being is because of what I mentioned earlier.  In general you want to castle before it's too late and the opportunity is gone.  That might have happened if I had hyperfocused on playing ...0-0.

At this point I remembered everything that was played but kept recording for seven more moves.  After this move however I do not remember what else got played and what I recorded after this is inaccurate so there was no point in annotating any other move.  Normally it is extremely important for me to remember all of the moves but this is an extenuating.  That's because as I mentioned in the into there's no time to finish the game.  All we know is that I am able to complete development with DSB and I exchange my g pawn with h pawn during that move.  And in 7-8 moves from now there will be a ton of exchanges.  And while it will appear that white would have the winning advantage it will actually be a drawn position.  But that is the important lesson to the game.  So the moral of this story is ""Don't give up right away"" as Jack Stockel has been telling since the beginning (since the first month that we've been playing each other.)  The reason being is that what appears to be a lost game might actually be drawn position.  Therefore resignation might be premature.  That's because if you resign you might be forfeiting when in reality you might have thrown away an opportunity to achieve a draw.  In other words you might subconsiencionciously resign a drawn position. "

753,19,17,Rf3,b'8/p1p5/3k4/3P1p2/3Kp3/5r2/P1R4P/8 w - -',From here to the end is how not to play a rook and pawn endgame.

756,19,20,5Ke4,b'8/p7/5k2/2p4P/4K3/8/8/8 b - -',a5 wins followed by a4 and he can't stop both pawns.
757,19,21,6Kxa4,b'8/8/8/7k/K7/8/8/8 b - -',I feel so ashamed.
758,20,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Ah the English. An opening that I am not all that accustomed to so I was already feeling uncomfortable from the start. 
759,20,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',e5 and Nf6 are equally good alternatives. I chose the symmetrical English because I felt it would lead to a simpler position out of the opening.
760,20,2,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',!? The main line of the Symmetrical English is g6. My objective was to strike out at the center with d5 at some point.
761,20,3,cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
762,20,4,exd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',?! Surely Nxd5 was best. The d5 pawn will soon become a big target.
763,20,5,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',This is why exd5 was not so good. This move threatens dxc5 which will create an isolated d5 pawn and open the d file for the queen.
764,20,6,Be6,b'r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This move seems ok to me as it develops a piece and supports d5. Be7 was likely best however because it sets up castling the next move.
765,20,7,dxc5,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/2Pp4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Opening the d file for the queen.
766,20,8,1Bg5,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2bp2B1/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This is a powerful pin because it is attempting to remove a defender from d5. White is now threatening after 10...O-O 11 Bxf6 Qxf6 12 Nxd5 Qxb2 13 Nc7 Rc8 14 Nxe6 fxe6. I rejected allowing white to play this line in the game even though this was probably best because the e6 pawn would be tough to defend.
767,20,9,1Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?! Waste of time. I was too concerned about the pin. O-O was called for in this position.
768,20,10,1Nd4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Good move. White is aiming to play Nxe6 which will set up some king side attacks for white.
769,20,11,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I can not play 11...Nxd4? 12 Qxd4 O-O 13 Rfd1 and white will capture the d5 pawn.
770,20,12,1e4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/4P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - e3',! My first instinct was that this was an inaccuracy. I calculated 13...Nxe4 14 Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nxe4 dxe4 16. Bxe4 Rad8 gave me a small edge. However white had a better idea....
771,20,13,1Nxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/3p2B1/4N3/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',! I had certainly not expected this. I began to think and saw that after Bxg5 that the knight could hop over to c5 and fork my pawns. I quickly wrote that off though because if 15 Nc5 Qe7 protected everything... or so I thought.
772,20,14,1Bxg5,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/3p2b1/4N3/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I was confident that I was now up a pawn and that I had fair chances against Ipatov.
773,20,15,1Nc5,b'r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/2Np2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Expected. White now has a good advantage because it will be difficult for black to properly defend the e6 pawn.
774,20,16,1Qe7,b'r4rk1/pp2q1pp/2n1p3/2Np2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? I had moved almost immediately because I thought that this was the best way to protect both b7 and e6. I missed a nice tactical shot though that loses 2 pawns. Best would have been Rf6. White could not immediately play Nxb7? after this because Qe7 traps the knight. 
775,20,17,1Nxe6,b'r4rk1/pp2q1pp/2n1N3/3p2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',! Taking advantage of a pin. If Qxe6?? then Bxd5 pins the queen to the king. There is no way for me to defend both the d5 pawn and the rook on f8.
776,20,18,1Rf5,b'r5k1/pp2q1pp/2n1N3/3p1rb1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',It was either this or Re8. I preferred this because I wanted to drive out the bishop quickly from d5.
777,20,19,Qd6,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2nqN3/3B1rb1/8/6P1/PP3P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',? Not sure what I was thinking here. Kh8 was necessary to avoid any dangerous discovered checks like Nc7+ which wins the exchange for white. I was probably too anxious to get rid of the bishop. 
778,20,20,1Bb3,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2nqN3/5rb1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',? But Ipatov misses it!! It appears white might have been thinking that I was now forced to exchange queens or else white would simply play Nxg5+ winning the bishop.
779,20,21,Kh8,b'r6k/pp4pp/2n1N3/5rb1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/3R1RK1 w - -',Forced in order to keep a piece or lose an exchange.
780,20,22,2Nxg5,b'r6k/pp4pp/2n5/5rN1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/3R1RK1 b - -',Hmm I am not a big fan of this move. I can understand the concept of exchanging pieces when ahead in material but white could have simply won another pawn with Rd7 if I am not mistaken.
781,20,23,2Rd7,b'r6k/pp1R2pp/2n5/6r1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/5RK1 b - -',Should have been played last move.
782,20,24,2Rb8,b'1r5k/pp1R2pp/2n5/6r1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/5RK1 w - -',?! b6 was best I think so that the rook can do something better than guarding the b pawn.
783,20,25,2Re1,b'1r5k/pp1R2pp/2n5/6r1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/4R1K1 b - -',? White's goal was to try to get connected rooks on the 7th rank. This actually turns out to make material even again.
784,20,26,2Ne5,b'1r5k/pp1R2pp/8/4n1r1/8/1B4P1/PP3P1P/4R1K1 w - -',Threatening both rooks!
785,20,27,2f4,b'1r5k/pp1R2pp/8/4n1r1/5P2/1B4P1/PP5P/4R1K1 b - f3',Forced if white wished to avoid losing the exchange.
786,20,28,2Nxd7,b'1r5k/pp1n2pp/8/6r1/5P2/1B4P1/PP5P/4R1K1 w - -',? The only excuse I have was that I was running low on time (I had about 5 minutes remaining). I could still not believe I had overlooked the obvious in-between move - Rxg3+ followed by Nxd7 with good drawing chances.
787,20,29,2Bf7,b'1r5k/pp3Bpp/8/2n3P1/8/6P1/PP5P/4R1K1 b - -',I am skeptical of this move. My idea was that Ipatov was trying to exchange rooks with Re8+. However with white having doubled pawns it might not be too difficult to get a draw if that was the case. Maybe white wanted to try g6 in an attempt to un-double his pawns.
788,20,30,2Nd3,b'1r5k/pp3Bpp/8/6P1/8/3n2P1/PP5P/4R1K1 w - -',!? Perhaps g6 with the intentions of getting the king off the back rank was a better plan.
789,20,31,2Re7,b'1r5k/pp2R2p/6p1/2n3P1/2B5/6P1/PP5P/6K1 b - -',Taking control of the back rank and also threatening b4 which would force the knight on the rim.
790,20,32,2Rd8,b'3r3k/pp2R2p/6p1/2n3P1/2B5/6P1/PP5P/6K1 w - -',?? The decisive mistake. a4 was required to prevent b4. Now white wins both the a pawn and the b pawn which will give white an easily winning endgame. 
791,20,33,2b4,b'3r3k/pp2R2p/6p1/2n3P1/1PB5/6P1/P6P/6K1 b - b3',If I play Nd7 then Bb5 would kick the knight regardless.
792,20,34,2Na4,b'3r3k/pp2R2p/6p1/6P1/nPB5/6P1/P6P/6K1 w - -',The knight probably has better prospects on c3.
793,20,35,3Bb3,b'3r3k/pp2R2p/6p1/6P1/nP6/1B4P1/P6P/6K1 b - -',?! Why not just take the pawn? I wanted to move the knight to c3 anyway. Perhaps white was concerned with Rd1+ but I could not move the rook off the back rank because of the threat of Re8+ Kg7 then Rg8#
794,20,36,Ne2+,b'3r3k/pR5p/6p1/6P1/1P6/1B4P1/P3n2P/6K1 w - -',?! Not best but it does not really matter at this point. Perhaps Ne4 was worth a shot.
795,20,37,3axb3,b'3r3k/R6p/6p1/6P1/1P6/1P4P1/5K1P/8 b - -',White is up by 3 pawns. My only hope is that white's doubled pawns will make it slightly easier for me to defend.
796,20,38,3Rd3,b'7k/R6p/6p1/6P1/1P6/1P1r2P1/5K1P/8 w - -',Rb8 was best because it would have forced the rook to a4 to keep the pawn. In that line the white king could run over to the queenside to protect the pawns and help push them to promotion.
797,20,39,3b5,b'7k/R6p/6p1/1P4P1/8/1P1r2P1/5K1P/8 b - -',White did not want to waste his time defending an immobile b pawn white is going for the win.
798,20,40,Kg8,b'6k1/1R5p/6p1/1P4P1/8/1r4P1/5K1P/8 w - -',All white has to do now is get the king to the queenside and support the b pawn.
799,20,41,Kd7,b'1R6/1P1k3p/6p1/6P1/8/1r4P1/5K1P/8 w - -',Kd6 may have been a better alternative but really it would just make the game last longer. 39...Kd6 40 Rh8 Kxb7 41 Rxh7+. Then white can push his king side pawns and the outcome will be the same.
800,20,42,Rxb7,b'7R/1r1k3p/6p1/6P1/8/6P1/5K1P/8 w - -',This finishes the game quickly (it is not like I had any better move). Now white will force a rook exchange and simply push his pawns.
801,20,43,4h5,b'8/2k5/6p1/6PP/8/6P1/5K2/8 b - -',I resigned. It was a great experience to play against a GM. Both sides had made their fair share of mistakes but of course Ipatov took much better advantage of my mistakes than I did his!

857,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hoi Sophia!
Als voorbereiding op de analyse van deze partij had ik even gekeken naar mijn commentaar op twee eerdere partijen en het viel mij op dat ik soms wel erg veel schreef. Ik zal proberen de commentaar hier kort en duidelijk te houden.
Verder wil ik er op wijzen dat je voor deze partij bijna een jaar niet hebt geschaakt. Het is zeker niet erg een foutje te maken na zo'n lange afwezigheid.
Deze partij toont aan hoe kwetsbaar een ontwikkelde dame kan zijn in de opening maar ook hij gevaarlijk een dergelijke dame soms kan zijn. "
858,22,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"Aangezien wij de vorige zetten al eens eerder hebben besproken zal ik hier beginnen. In schaken is het onverstandig de beslissing tot een zet te maken zonder een doel voor ogen te hebben. Het einddoel in schaken is schaakmat maar in de opening van een partij kan dit doel nog erg ver weg en abstract lijken. Voor beginners is het daarom handig de 3 gouden openingsregels te kennen:

- stukken ontwikkelen
- pionnen in het centrum zetten
- koning in veiligheid brengen

De zet die wit hier doet voldoet perfect aan de 3 regels. Hij zet twee pionnen in het centrum en opent erg veel lijnen voor zijn stukken zodat deze zich snel kunnen ontwikkelen. Nadat wit hierna zijn stukken naar buiten heeft gebracht kan hij snel rokeren (liefst koningszijde) en heeft hij een mooie positie om verder mee te gaan. Waarom is deze zet desondanks niet de populairste zet ooit?"
859,22,2,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',De beste zet. De directe aanpak van wit zet druk op jouw centrum (de pion op e5) en zwart kan zich niet echt verloven om het te negeren. Als jij bijvoorbeeld besluit jouw pion op e5 te verdedigen door jouw paard op veld c6 te zetten kan hij zijn pion op d4  doorschuiven waarna hij veel ruimte heeft in het centrum en jouw paard aanvalt.  
860,22,3,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',De ontwikkeling blijkt met een prijs te komen. De dame is juist de stuk die je meestal niet te snel wilt ontwikkelen juist omdat zij zo sterk is. Geen van beide spelers kan zich veroorloven de dame te verliezen en daarom kan zij makkelijk worden opgejaagd. 
861,22,4,Be7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',"?  Zwart ontwikkelt een stuk en komt en stap dichter bij rokade. Helaas is het echter fout want er wordt een pion(g7) onverdedigd achter gelaten. Nadat de dame deze pion neemt zou jij de dame enigszins kunnen opjagen door met de loper naar f6 te gaan. De dame zou weg moeten gaan en zwart zou een kleine ontwikkelingsvoordeel krijgen. Helaas is deze voordeeltje niet voldoende compensatie voor de verloren pion. Daar komt nog bij dat na het verliezen van de pion op g7 de zwarte koning zich iets minder op zijn gemak zal voelen.
Probeer na elke zet niet alleen te kijken of de bewogen stuk/pion veilig staat maar ook of er na de zet andere stukken onverdedigd achter wordt gelaten.
In plaats van de loper zet zou paard naar veld c6 zou een logische zet zijn geweest en de nadeel van de witte opening aantonen. Zwart ontwikkelt dan een stuk en valt de witte dame aan waardoor wit zelf niet direct kan doorgaan met ontwikkelen."
862,22,5,b3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/3QP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',??  Een dubbele vraagteken hier want wit laat niet alleen een grote kans liggen: hij geeft jou een grote kans om de voordeel te pakken. Na b2-b3 staan er twee zware onverdedigde stukken op dezelfde diagonaal en jouw loper staat klaar om hier gebruik van te maken.
863,22,6,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/8/3QP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',"? Zwart ontwikkelt een stuk en valt de dame aan. De directe Loper naar f6 zou echter sterker zijn geweest. De vroege ontwikkeling van de dame heeft de spel snel tactisch gemaakt en dus is het wat lastig om dit zonder variaties uit te leggen Na Loper e7-f6 wordt de dame aangevallen en als hij zou terugtrekken kan jij een mooie onverdedigde toren (a1) grijpen. Wit zou dus na Le7-f6 zijn pion moeten opspelen (e4 naar e5) en wellicht was deze zet de reden waarom jij niet onmiddellijk de loper zet deed. De pion sluit niet alleen de diagonaal maar valt de loper zelfs aan. Echter zou hierna de paardzet (Paard b8 - c6) de reddende zet zijn. De witte dame en de pion op e5 zou worden aangevallen en nadat wit zijn dame wegzet kan jij de pion op e5 nemen. De extra pion in combinatie met de betere ontwikkeling zou wit een erg grote voordeel hebben gegeven.
Na de zet die jij doet heeft zwart nog steeds een voordeel vanwege zijn betere ontwikkeling maar kan wit directe materiaalverlies voorkomen. "
864,22,7,Qxg7,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbpQp/2n5/8/4P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',? Wit valt voor de valletje en gaat nu minstens zijn toren verliezen voor een pion. Beter was bijvoorbeeld terugtrekken met de dame naar e3 of d3 en als zwart zijn toren zou aanvallen met Le7-f6 zou hij zijn paard ertussen kunnen zetten (Pb8-c3). 
865,22,8,Bf6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pQp/2n2b2/8/4P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',! Goed gezien. De loper valt nu zowel de witte dame aan als de toren op a1. Wit zal één van beiden moeten verliezen.
866,22,9,Bxa1,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/4P1Q1/1P6/P1P2PPP/bNB1KBNR w Kkq -',"De buit is binnen. Hierna sta jij in materiaal opzicht gewonnen. Dit houdt in dat als je verder zou kunnen afruilen naar een eindspel jij een winnend voordeel zou hebben. Op het moment zijn er echter nog veel stukken op het bord en is de positie van jouw koning een beetje verzwakt.
Meer dan eens heb jij aangegeven moeite te hebben met het zien van schaakmat. Wat is schaakmat? Zoals jij weet kan een koning in tegenstelling tot andere stukken niet genomen worden. Zodra een koning wordt aangevallen is de eigenaar van de koning verplicht ervoor te zorgen dat de koning niet meer wordt aangevallen aan het einde van zijn beurt. Schaakmat is de situatie wanneer een speler zijn koning niet meer uit de aanval te halen. 
Verdedigen tegen schaakmat houdt dus in dat jij ervoor zorgt dat de koning ofwel:
- helemaal niet aangevallen kan worden
- vluchtvelden heeft waar hij heen kan gaan als hij wordt aangevallen
- stukken bij zich in de buurt heeft die een aanvaller kan nemen
- stukken bij zich in de buurt heeft die zichzelf tussen de aanvaller en de koning kan plaatsen"
867,22,10,Bg5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6B1/4P1Q1/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2KBNR b Kkq -',Wit ontwikkelt snel in de hoop dat hij een aanval tegen jouw koning kan organiseren. Dit is waarschijnlijk zijn beste zet of in ieder geval zijn beste hoop.
868,22,11,f6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp3p/2n2p2/6B1/4P1Q1/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2KBNR w Kkq -',"? De diagonaal tussen h5 en e8 is erg gevaarlijk wanneer deze open is omdat er geen stukken zijn die zich hier tussen kan plaatsen. Als wit dus over deze diagonaal aanvalt moet de koning wel vluchten want er is geen stuk die hem kan helpen. Een ander probleem is dat na deze zet de zwarte loper (a1) niet meer goed kan meehelpen met de verdediging. 
Je had jouw loper terug moeten halen naar f6."
869,22,12,Qh5+,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp3p/2n2p2/6BQ/4P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2KBNR b Kkq -',Natuurlijk de juiste zet.
870,22,13,Ke7,b'r1bq2nr/ppppk2p/2n2p2/6BQ/4P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2KBNR w K -',! Op f8 zou de zwarte koning nog minder vluchtvelden hebben en zou Loper naar c4 waarschijnlijk dodelijk zijn geweest. 
871,22,14,Bc4,b'r1bq2nr/ppppk2p/2n2p2/6BQ/2B1P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2K1NR b K -',De loper geeft de witte dame ondersteuning bij het aanvallen van de koning. De dame dreigt nu binnen te komen op f7. De zwarte koning heeft dan maar één vluchtveld over en zal worden opgejaagd tot de mat erop volgt. Aangezien de koning zichzelf niet kan verdedigen moet zwart er snel voor zorgen dat zijn stukken de koning kan helpen met verdedigen.
872,22,15,fxg5,b'r1bq2nr/ppppk2p/2n5/6pQ/2B1P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/bN2K1NR w K -',"? Vermoedelijk de verliezende fout. Het was noodzakelijk om met dwang er stukken bij te halen die mee kunnen helpen met de verdediging.
Beste en wellicht enigste zet was pion van d7 naar d5. Het valt de loper aan en onderbreekt de ondersteuning van deze loper zodat wit zijn dame niet naar f7 kan spelen. Na de pionzet zou wit de pion waarschijnlijk nemen met zijn loper waarna de dreiging (Dh5 - f7+) zich herhaalt. Echter met de pion uit de weg kan jouw andere loper zich bij de verdediging gaan bemoeien (Loper c8 - e6) waarna zwart goede kansen moet hebben de aanval af te slaan."

1002,30,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',my favourite I feel like I'm very familiar with the typical pawn structures plans and just general play that arises from a lot of symmetrical English positions
1003,30,1,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',so far both sides developing in the same manner and neither one has yet to commit themselves to the centre this is one of the key ideas in the English its flexible and looks to keep a number of options as to how to strike in the center
1004,30,2,d5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2pp4/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq d6',according to gameKnot the first non book move. I could have maintained the symmetry for another move however I felt it best to be the first one to strike since I can easily castle at a moments notice I'm unlikely to run into any trouble by having an uncastled king. But I felt if I waited one move more white would get to shape how the game would progress
1005,30,3,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2pn4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',?! The first suspect move There are a number of different ways for white to organise their pieces right now as well as a number of different plans to adopt. I'm not going to give y opinion on which is best since there are many plausible options however I do feel that in most cases the rook will end up being misplaced here since this move doesn't really help achieve anything basically I think its a waste of time as white should keep the rooks options open until its clear where it does belong. obviously this is not a big deal though I just think there were more accurate moves available
1006,30,4,Qb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2pn4/8/1QN2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',Attacking the knight. The queen does often come to this square in English positions If I were white I might have started thinking about which pawn advance I wanted to make but this move isn't bad and I'm not sure what I would do myself so I'm not going to be overly critical of this move the only potential down side being that if white choses to make advances on the queenside then this move may slow it down a little 
1007,30,5,Nc7,b'r1bq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/8/1QN2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',!? You will find my knight make this journey in a decent amount of my games especially in English positions I find that from c7 (normally I arrive via f6-e8-c7) I have the advantage of keeping my bishops diagonal clear I also keep an eye on b5 which may help facilitate a b pawn advance and the big one is also that it give me a route to e6 which can be a great square in these positions since often having both knights with their sites on d4 is beneficial especially in cases where whites already committed the e pawn to advancing two squares
1008,30,6,1Rb1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/8/1QN2NP1/PP1PPPBP/1RB1R1K1 b - -',okay this gets out of my DSB diagonal and probably means whites looking to make advances on this wing to do this he will need to move his queen first
1009,30,7,1Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/8/1QN2NP1/PP1PPPBP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',I do the same at my end if I chose to go with the same plan then mine will come to fruition just that little bit quicker because my pieces are co-ordinated more effectively to achieve it. This also has the benefit of protecting my b pawn in case I want to play ...Be6
1010,30,8,b6,b'1rbq1rk1/p1n1ppbp/1pn3p1/2p5/8/2N2NP1/PPQPPPBP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',I go with a more restrained approach. it was possible to play ...b5 but I like to keep pawns as close to home as possible the further away they go the more likely they are to find themselves over extended. with this move I'm basically protecting my c pawn and preparing to fianchetto my LSB in order to contest the long light square diagonal
1011,30,9,Ne6,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2ppbp/1pn1n1p1/2p5/8/P1NP1NP1/1PQ1PPBP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',A lovely spot for the knight just as white prepares to strike on the queenside make a play in the centre using my pieces. the 'threat' is to jump into d4 which would be uncomfortable for white so I'm hoping to commit whites e pawn to advancing there by 'softening' whites d pawn which I can try to turn into a target 
1012,30,10,1e3,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2ppbp/1pn1n1p1/2p5/8/P1NPPNP1/1PQ2PBP/1RB1R1K1 b - -',white reacts to the threat which gives me something to aim at. Now one possible plan is to try to control d4 which would fix whites d pawn in place one way to do this is to get my e6 knight out of the way then follow up with ...e5 I still need to be careful about whites ideas though if white successfully breaks at my c pawn with b4 then fixing d3 will be a little harder. For now however I chose to try weaken the light squares around whites king since my knight on e6 could potentially be well placed to take advantage of it
1013,30,11,Bxe5,b'1r1q1rk1/pb2pp1p/1p2n1p1/2p1b3/8/P1NPP1P1/1PQ2PBP/1RB1R1K1 w - -',15...Bxg2?? 16.Nxf7
