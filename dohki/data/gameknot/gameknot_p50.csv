41,3,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',I reply with this- I've also found Nf6 to be equally effective...
42,3,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Instead of continuing the Reti via c4 so that White can contest Black's ability to own the centre (a reason I find Reti games a bit scary to deal with at times) he instead goes into a King's Indian Attack planning to fianchetto the bishop right away.
43,3,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I decide to undermine the incoming fianchetto.
44,3,4,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Which he still performs.
45,3,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',More development. I'm a bit relaxed at his reluctance to push pawns.
46,3,6,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',And now he castles. Once again I'm not complaining- should White try to contest d5 right away it is well defended. However if White doesn't try to gain space with pawns soon I'll gain the initiative sooner or later...
47,3,7,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',White's Nf3 is a lot stronger than his Bg2. So this is a nice neat way to threaten a pin if he decides to budge the e pawn but also allows me to kill the knight if I decide I hate it too much. 
48,3,8,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This might appear passive at first glance but it makes e4 and c4 to be much stronger moves by White- and it also brings his dark bishop into the game.
49,3,9,Nbd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I want to play e5 but if I do that now he just plays Nxe5.

51,3,11,e5,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq e6',This pawn is now secure and I'm able to stake a claim into the centre.

53,3,13,dxe4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4p1b1/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq -',Which I don't. I have enough to fight with on the e4 square.
54,3,14,dxe4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 b kq -',He takes back and now I hold the first move.
55,3,15,Be7,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq -',This preemptively removes the threat of Bg5 and now I can castle. Black appears to be very solid right now and it would seem White will have to scramble to find a secure way into my defenses. Black's pieces are almost developed whereas White's queenside remains largely untouched...

59,3,19,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/1P3bP1/PBP2PBP/RN2QRK1 w - -',Now for this... I'm sure there was plenty else Black could have done at this point. I personally didn't believe the light bishop was terribly frightening but the Nf3 was weakening my e5 control rapidly. As it would turn out it was never going to be the light bishop to cause me so much grief so all in all I think this was probably the right call in the long run.
60,3,20,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/1P3BP1/PBP2P1P/RN2QRK1 b - -',The exchange is forced and I get the initiative again.

62,3,22,1Nd2,b'r2qr1k1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/1P3BP1/PBPN1P1P/R3QRK1 b - -',The knight moves here to defend e4 without blocking the bishop if he instead played Nc3.

White's dark bishop would now be in an awkward place and I was sure I could continue attacking- if he plays Bxf6 then Qxf6 will stop White from playing c3 against Bb4 and if he played c3 right away then Rxe5 cxb4 axb4 Qxb4 would lead to me restoring equality after I play Qd3. The bishop retreats and the knight could capture on e4 giving me three strong centralized pieces staring down White's Queen and King.
66,3,26,1Ne3,b'r2qr1k1/3nbppp/2p2n2/pp2p3/4P3/1P2NBP1/PBP2P1P/R3QRK1 b - -',Of course I don't think I saw all that in the heat of the moment. I wonder if White saw more or if he simply just wanted a better square for his knight all along. :P

This move gave me multiple back-rank defenders and even a defense to g7 if I needed it against his Bb2...
68,3,28,1Rd1,b'r2qrbk1/3n1ppp/2p2n2/pp2p3/4P3/1P2NBP1/PBP2P1P/3RQRK1 b - -',And I'd say right around here begins the turning point of the game. Each move White played after this for the next 15 turns made me start to see how exploitable my defenses were at this point. And no matter how badly I'd try to fix the position I could never fully shut down the threats; it took nearly the entire rest of the match for me to secure my defenses to finish the attacks I planned.
69,3,29,1Qc7,b'r3rbk1/2qn1ppp/2p2n2/pp2p3/4P3/1P2NBP1/PBP2P1P/3RQRK1 w - -',I hate pinning knights to queens. Here seemed to be a good spot- it helps guard the knight from the d1 rook guards e5 again or guards f7. Again- I was very confident that my defenses were solid but in retrospect this somehow became a very annoying square for the queen to be on...

It's an extremely aggressive move- the knight can be pinned via both Bc5 or Qb6 but all of those moves are a tempo behind White's. Also I don't want to exchange my back rank pieces- they're powerful and I don't want to lose them to undermine the others...
77,3,37,1exf4,b'r3r1k1/2qn1pp1/2p2n1p/1p6/pb2Pp2/4N1P1/PBP1Q1BP/3R1RK1 w - -',As far as the pawn is concerned I need it gone so I throw my e5 away.

I was shocked by this move and then slowly I realized what this move would start doing to my kingside. I see the bishop on b2 and then I see my own bishop no longer guarding g7. If I take that rook I must be prepared to defend immediately.
81,3,41,2Nxg4,b'r3r1k1/2qn1pp1/2pb3p/1p6/p3P1n1/4N1P1/PBP1Q1BP/3R2K1 w - -',After a long careful think I decided I would contest the material disadvantage against my defenses.

83,3,43,2g6,b'r3r1k1/2qn1p2/2pb2pp/1p6/p3P1Q1/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R2K1 w - -',GK doesn't like this move saying that Ne5 would have solved my problems better. Still I just didn't want to have to keep worrying about Qxg7 anymore. While this won't stop the knight from coming in it will at least push the queen back for a few turns. 
84,3,44,2Qh4,b'r3r1k1/2qn1p2/2pb2pp/1p6/p3P2Q/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R2K1 b - -',"""Pushing the queen BACK"" was the correct phrase. She doesn't have to retreat. h6 is now under attack but if I'm careless about my defenses I notice that my knight is stuck on d7 (or else Qf6 fcd mate!) and my queen is stuck doing nothing while White continues pressuring me more and more..."

I felt this was a slightly safer alternative.
86,3,46,2Qg5,b'r3r1k1/2qn1p2/2pb2p1/1p4Qp/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R2K1 b - -',So White goes here threatening a simple Qh6. The knight can still come in from f5 and I was desperately grasping at how to stop that from happening.
87,3,47,2Ne5,b'r3r1k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1Qp/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R2K1 w - -',Finally! The knight can move off of d7. It now blocks the terrifying Bb2 from allowing this pesky queen to terrorize my king any further and I guard it three times still way back when a pawn previously occupied that square.
88,3,48,2Kh1,b'r3r1k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1Qp/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R3K b - -',And then... he moves the king for some reason? I'm not entirely sure why- perhaps he thought the threats of Qb6 or Bc5 were more significant at this point? 
89,3,49,2Qd8,b'r2qr1k1/5p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1Qp/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R3K w - -',The Queen can still trap my king via Qh6 but it will isolate itself from the rest of the White pieces if it chooses to do so. I was hopeful I could force capture if it tried to keep pressing the attack.
90,3,50,2Qf4,b'r2qr1k1/5p2/2pb2p1/1p2n2p/p3PQ2/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R3K b - -',Likewise White didn't favor his chances either so this feisty queen reluctantly retreats here.
91,3,51,2Re6,b'r2q2k1/5p2/2pbr1p1/1p2n2p/p3PQ2/4N1P1/PBP3BP/3R3K w - -',"I knew going in that playing this would allow for Bh3. It would be a risk but I thought that I had enough control after Rf6 to win whatever exchanges would happen after. All I could think at this point was ""if I just end the attack spearheaded by The Queen of Sass I could regain control of the game!"""
92,3,52,2Qf2,b'r2q2k1/5p2/2pbr1p1/1p2n2p/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP2QBP/3R3K b - -',To my surprise and relief the Queen puts a halt to her sass and retreats again.
93,3,53,2Rf6,b'r2q2k1/5p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n2p/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP2QBP/3R3K w - -',This move is even stronger now and she must move again.
94,3,54,2Qe2,b'r2q2k1/5p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n2p/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K b - -',The queen remains here a core to White's defenses for the next bit of time and I'm finally allowed to regain control of the game again. I need to play sharp lest I allow White to harass my defenses again.
95,3,55,2Qc7,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n2p/p3P3/4N1P1/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K w - -',I want my queen to defend e5 again just in case but I also noticed that my Ra8 has zero influence in this game right now and that will have to change immediately.
96,3,56,2g4,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n2p/p3P1P1/4N3/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K b - -',White sees I'm trying to re-adjust my defenses and tries to open my pawns up again.
97,3,57,2h4,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n3/p3P1Pp/4N3/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K w - -',I refuse. There's no way I'm letting The Queen of Sass back into my domain.
98,3,58,3g5,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb1rp1/1p2n1P1/p3P2p/4N3/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K b - -',Hitting my rook and I can't retreat or else Bh3 disrupts my defenses again.
99,3,59,3Rf4,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3Pr1p/4N3/PBP1Q1BP/3R3K w - -',So I push ahead trying to buy enough time to figure out a better position.
100,3,60,3Bc1,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3Pr1p/4N3/P1P1Q1BP/2BR3K b - -',The bishop finally off b2 no longer a threat there- now allowing a discovered attack on the rook. 
101,3,61,3h3,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3Pr2/4N2p/P1P1Q1BP/2BR3K w - -',So I threaten a capture- with check so he can't continue with the discovered attack.
102,3,62,3Bxh3,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3Pr2/4N2B/P1P1Q2P/2BR3K b - -',Practically forced.
103,3,63,3Rh4,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3P2r/4N2B/P1P1Q2P/2BR3K w - -',One last push... now I threaten Rxh3 and Rxe4 but I have a third plan in mind...!
104,3,64,3Qg2,b'r5k1/2q2p2/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3P2r/4N2B/P1P3QP/2BR3K b - -',The Queen of Sass starts getting feisty with my rook again.
105,3,65,3Rh7,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3P3/4N2B/P1P3QP/2BR3K w - -',And my defenses snap shut again! This was a plan I had in motion since Rf4 knowing that I needed a rook to defend the f7 pawn after White plays Rf1. But if I retreated via Re6 then White's Bishop lands on h3 forcing this rook onto f7 blocking the other rook from defending with my Queen. This is a much better spot for the rook as it guards f7 while threatening White if he dare moves the Queen of Sass- he could lose the bishop.
106,3,66,3Rf1,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p2n1P1/p3P3/4N2B/P1P3QP/2B2R1K b - -',Even though my defenses are working again this is a better spot for White's rook. I can't move my f pawn at all for the next bit of time.
107,3,67,3Bc5,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1pb1n1P1/p3P3/4N2B/P1P3QP/2B2R1K w - -',I need to start using my material advantage now that I've secured it. Between White's terrifying dark bishop his potentially threatening knight and his weak light bishop I figure this is the exchange I can gain the most from.
108,3,68,3Ng4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1pb1n1P1/p3P1N1/7B/P1P3QP/2B2R1K b - -',He wonders if I'll decline if my knight is instead at risk.
109,3,69,3Nxg4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1pb3P1/p3P1n1/7B/P1P3QP/2B2R1K w - -',And of course I won't. That knight was only stuck at e5 because my rook wasn't at h7- I'm much happier to keep the bishop!
110,3,70,3Qxg4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1pb3P1/p3P1Q1/7B/P1P4P/2B2R1K b - -',So the Queen of Sass strengthens the light bishop and continues to guard h3-e4.
111,3,71,3Bd6,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p4P1/p3P1Q1/7B/P1P4P/2B2R1K w - -',I also tie my bishop and queen threatening winning h2 and pinning the bishop to the King.
112,3,72,3Rf2,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p4P1/p3P1Q1/7B/P1P2R1P/2B4K b - -',But this is now playable due to my bishop no longer on c5.
113,3,73,3a3,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p4P1/4P1Q1/p6B/P1P2R1P/2B4K w - -',So I secure my queenside edge. If White lets me gain any more ground on this side of the board a promotion threat will be almost totally unavoidable from this point on.
114,3,74,3Bf4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2pb2p1/1p4P1/4PBQ1/p6B/P1P2R1P/7K b - -',White now believes it's worth his stronger bishop if I lose control of my diagonals.
115,3,75,3Bxf4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4PbQ1/p6B/P1P2R1P/7K w - -',I think he's wrong threatening to punish the Queen of Sass if she gets feisty again...
116,3,76,3Rxf4,b'r5k1/2q2p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4PRQ1/p6B/P1P4P/7K b - -',If Qxf4 then I play Qxf4. After White plays Rxf4 then Rxh3...
117,3,77,3Qa5,b'r5k1/5p1r/2p3p1/qp4P1/4PRQ1/p6B/P1P4P/7K w - -',-of course if I had played Rxh3 right then I would have seen Qxh3 and then I had Qxf4! I saw the first part of the line but not the second! Thinking that I couldn't proceed with the attack anymore I start focusing my attention on the king. Nice but damn could that have been better!!!
118,3,78,4Rf2,b'r5k1/5p1r/2p3p1/qp4P1/4P1Q1/p6B/P1P2R1P/7K b - -',My queen threatens 3 squares: c3 d2 and e1. If White had played Rf1 here anticipating the check then Black had Qc3 guarenteeing that I at least win the c2 pawn but probably the a2 pawn as well after a few checks. White could stop that from happening but the result I believed after enough checks would wind up  my queen on the 3rd row White defending the a2 pawn but then I finish with Rxh3...
119,3,79,4Qe1+,b'r5k1/5p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4P1Q1/p6B/P1P2R1P/4q2K w - -',So Rf2 was a good call since it allows for this move...
120,3,80,4Kg2,b'r5k1/5p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4P1Q1/p6B/P1P2RKP/4q3 b - -',The King is now a h3 defender. I overlooked my attack but it's far from over.
121,3,81,4Qc3,b'r5k1/5p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4P1Q1/p1q4B/P1P2RKP/8 w - -',I start trying to target both a2 and h3 again.
122,3,82,4Qd7,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/4P3/p1q4B/P1P2RKP/8 b - -',The Queen of Sass has had enough of my rudeness and starts getting feisty with my f7 pawn again. Annoying is the fact that she can attack both f7 from here while defending h3.
123,3,83,4Qc4,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p4P1/2q1P3/p6B/P1P2RKP/8 w - -',Threatening Qxa2 and Qxe4+.
124,3,84,4e5,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p2P1P1/2q5/p6B/P1P2RKP/8 b - -',And it was probably a bad idea because if that pawn hits e6 it's curtains for me.
125,3,85,4Qe4+,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p2P1P1/4q3/p6B/P1P2RKP/8 w - -',So I throw in a check ensuring that the pawn is dropped. 
126,3,86,4Kf1,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p2P1P1/4q3/p6B/P1P2R1P/5K2 b - -',The king retreats here. I REALLY wanted to play Qh1+ but I saw that White had enough blockages to force a retreat- and I can't afford any more wasted tempo at this point.
127,3,87,4Qxe5,b'r5k1/3Q1p1r/2p3p1/1p2q1P1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/5K2 w - -',So I end the pawn while I still have the chance.
128,3,88,4Qxc6,b'r5k1/5p1r/2Q3p1/1p2q1P1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/5K2 b - -',This finally buys The Queen of Sass enough time to start taking care of my queenside... 
129,3,89,4Re8,b'4r1k1/5p1r/2Q3p1/1p2q1P1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/5K2 w - -',This is forced or else Qxa8+ ruining the day for me yet again. e1 has gotten weaker however...
130,3,90,4Qd7,b'4r1k1/3Q1p1r/6p1/1p2q1P1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/5K2 b - -',And once again The Queen of Sass gets feisty with the poor probably-a-nice-guy f7 pawn.
131,3,91,4Qe1+,b'4r1k1/3Q1p1r/6p1/1p4P1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/4qK2 w - -',My Queen starts telling the White King off for not keeping his wife under control.
132,3,92,4Kg2,b'4r1k1/3Q1p1r/6p1/1p4P1/8/p6B/P1P2RKP/4q3 b - -',He ignores her. Geez how rude!
133,3,93,4Qe4+,b'4r1k1/3Q1p1r/6p1/1p4P1/4q3/p6B/P1P2RKP/8 w - -',I play this still thinking that I can force the king out of hiding but I forgot one minor detail...
134,3,94,4Kg1,b'4r1k1/3Q1p1r/6p1/1p4P1/4q3/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 b - -',White can force a draw with this or even block with Bf1 and there's not much I can do about it. If my Queen leaves the e-file now then I lose after Qxe8+ again.
135,3,95,4f5,b'4r1k1/3Q3r/6p1/1p3pP1/4q3/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 w - f6',So I block The Queen of Sass from the bishop demanding her to move out of the way again.
136,3,96,4Qd6,b'4r1k1/7r/3Q2p1/1p3pP1/4q3/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 b - -',And she gets feisty one final time with me. My next move needs to be played very carefully because if I neglect the queen's influence of the game then White simply forces a draw after Qxg6+ with perpetual checks. White's final attack- this time for a draw.
137,3,97,4Qe7,b'4r1k1/4q2r/3Q2p1/1p3pP1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 w - -',It took me almost two full days but this was my response threatening Qxg5+. GK instead suggests Re6 but after looking at that line I saw an open back rank and was sure that the Queen could still harass the king if I was careless enough to leave the back rank open.
138,3,98,5Qxg6+,b'4r1k1/4q2r/6Q1/1p3pP1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 b - -',And all according to plan The Queen of Sass enters what will be her final rant getting feisty with my poor pawns but ending her brutal reign in the process.
139,3,99,5Rg7,b'4r1k1/4q1r1/6Q1/1p3pP1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 w - -',My rook gets in the way and exploits the lack of defenses on g5 even more.
140,3,100,5Qxf5,b'4r1k1/4q1r1/8/1p3QP1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 b - -',And White decides that it's time for the queens to move off the board.
141,3,101,5Rxg5+,b'4r1k1/4q3/8/1p3Qr1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 w - -',I agree so I spark the exchanges.
142,3,102,5Qxg5+,b'4r1k1/4q3/8/1p4Q1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 b - -',The Queen of Sass is screaming up and down...
143,3,103,5Qxg5+,b'4r1k1/8/8/1p4q1/8/p6B/P1P2R1P/6K1 w - -',...and at long last I finally silence her!
144,3,104,5Rg2,b'4r1k1/8/8/1p4q1/8/p6B/P1P3RP/6K1 b - -',Of course my own queen has to make a valiant sacrifice.
145,3,105,5Bxg2,b'4r1k1/8/8/1p6/8/p7/P1P3BP/6K1 b - -',And it's going to be okay since at long last all that remains is my stronger Queenside edge supported by a rook against his selective bishop who cannot defend a1 directly.
146,3,106,5Re2,b'6k1/8/8/1p6/8/p7/P1P1r1BP/6K1 w - -',Black should win by cutting off the King's ability to defend the kingside pawn.
147,3,107,5Bd5+,b'6k1/8/8/1p1B4/8/p7/P1P1r2P/6K1 b - -',So there's really only one sequence left for White after this check.
148,3,108,5Kg7,b'8/6k1/8/1p1B4/8/p7/P1P1r2P/6K1 w - -',I'm forced to go here. White must play Bb3 now or else either pawn will surpass White's pieces.
149,3,109,5c3,b'8/6k1/8/1p1B4/8/p1P5/P3r2P/6K1 b - -',He doesn't so I just simply win a pawn after that blunder.
150,3,110,5Rc2,b'8/6k1/8/1p1B4/8/p1P5/P1r4P/6K1 w - -',White must sacrifice one of the queenside pawns now and the game is surely over.
151,3,111,Rxc3,b'8/6k1/8/1p1B4/8/p1r4P/P7/6K1 w - -',With my pawns much closer to promotion and his King totally unavailable to defend the servants White's game is lost and resigns here. Interesting enough after all the energy White had this match my opponent revealed to me that he actually didn't intend to play Rg4! After all I went through this game I was shocked and told him that he probably made one of the best mistakes you could in this game. He was humbled and I enjoyed how sharp this game was. Thanks for reading this annotation!
152,4,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',So I start with my usual.
153,4,1,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He invites a Caro-Kann which would arise if I play 2. e4 and he replies with d5. I am sure he knows more about it than me so I avoid that!
154,4,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',So I invite a Slav defence with d5
155,4,3,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p5/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',But he avoids that and opts for a Dutch Defence.
156,4,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p5/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',So I develop.
157,4,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/2p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He does the natural developing move too.
158,4,6,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/2p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',And me also.
159,4,7,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',He opts for a Leningrad formation with his bishop on g7 rather than playing e7-e6 and developing it along the f8-a3 diagonal.
160,4,8,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I continue to develop.
161,4,9,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',As does he.
162,4,10,e4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq e3',So I grab the centre.
163,4,11,fxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPp3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',He takes.
164,4,12,Nxe4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I take back.
165,4,13,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ -',He castles.
166,4,14,Ne2,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I play the natural developing move too. I am planning 0-0 and Ne2-c3 to back up the knight on e4.
167,4,15,Nxe4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p3p1/8/2PPn3/6P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',So he takes before I can get the knight round.
168,4,16,Bxe4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p3p1/8/2PPB3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I take back. e4 is a lovely square for one of my minor pieces but it would be even better to have a knight on this square rather than a bishop.
169,4,17,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p2bp/2p3p1/4p3/2PPB3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',I am not sure about this move. After my next the range of his Bg7 is limited and my minor piece on e4 is unable to be shifted by a pawn.
170,4,18,1d5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p2bp/2p3p1/3Pp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R b KQ -',So I close up the position.
171,4,19,1Qb6,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p2bp/1qp3p1/3Pp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R w KQ -',This move surprised me. He has pressure on f2 and b2 but is this move really better than simple development such as d6?
172,4,20,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p2bp/1qp3p1/3Pp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',So I castle and protect f2.
173,4,21,1c5,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p2bp/1q4p1/2pPp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',He blocks the position up.
174,4,22,1d6,b'rnb2rk1/pp1p2bp/1q1P2p1/2p1p3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This is a double edged move. If I can maintain this pawn here it may be very hard for him to develop his queen-side pieces. This d6 pawn also cuts his position in two and may hinder him from moving pieces from the queen-side to the king-side and vice versa. On the other hand this advanced pawn could end up being weak and lost. Also d5-d6 allows his knight to develop to c6 and then d5.

Also if he does play Nd4 I can take with the knight and then protect d6 by the bishop on either a3 or f4. I may also be able to play Bg5-e7 in some variations.
179,4,27,1Nb4,b'r1b2r1k/pp1p2bp/1q1P2p1/2pQp3/1nP1B3/1P4P1/P3NP1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',So the knight comes in this way instead.

Bb2	and if Rxd6 then Bxe5+ or Bxd6 then Qg5 in both cases with advantage to white. So black's best is to retreat the knight and threaten Nd4 again.

218,6,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',English opening.  White generally responds Pe5 or Nf6.
219,6,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Pe5.  White does well with Nc3 or maybe Pg3.
220,6,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',For some reason black seems to do better when white plays this though it looks perfectly fine to me.
221,6,3,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black opts for a quick checkmate.  White should expect Bc5.  Not that this move must be defended against just yet.  But Nf3 should defend against that just fine.
222,6,4,d3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',...this move too works though white's pawns may get doubled by BxBe3 (in a couple of moves).
223,6,5,Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Yes black is eying QxPf2#.  White knows better than to fall for such cheap theatrics.

Black loses both knights (6 points) for the white queen (9 points).  Probably a good deal.  But that move is still available after the king moves.

This has the advantage of getting black to commit himself before white plays Bd3.  For example if black plays Be7 first then in the game that follows he would not have had the option of playing Qxf6 later.

263,8,9,Ke7,b'5b1r/4kppp/1q3n2/2pbN3/Qp6/4P3/1P2BPPP/2B2RK1 w - -',Obviously Kd8 doesn't work because of the knight fork on f7.

Kg7 (Ke7 f5 {Threatens a crushing Bg5+} f6 and now Nxc5 or Bg5! anyway and black is crushed)  Bc4! with mate threats.  If after Rxd5 c4 instead Nc6+! with the powerful threat of Qe3+ so if Black plays Ke6 (Qxc6 Qe3+ Qe6 Re5) Qe3+ Kxd5 Bf3+ with a crushing king hunt:  Kd6 Qd4+ Ke6 Qxc4+ Kd6 Be3 Bg7 Bc5+ Kd7 Qxf7+ Kc8 Na7+ Kd8 (Kb8 Bd6!) Nc6+ Kc8 Qe6+ Kb7 Nb4+ forces mate.

This is so bad for black that the computer analyzes black throwing away his pieces with Ne4 Bxe4 Bd4 Bxd4 cxd4 Bxa8.  After Qc4 if black plays Ra5 then Bxg6 Qc7 fxg5 and black gets mated no matter what he does; There are too many threats.  If the knight moves then this allows Rf1+.

One possible line here is Nd7 (Otherwise white plays Rf1 and Bh7 threatening mate on g8) Rf1+ Bf6 Qh4! Kg8 (to stop Qh8 mate) gxf6 Nf6 Bd3 (to cover the back rank and threaten Bc4+) Rc8 (Kg7 Qg5+ is easy) Qxf6 with an easy win.

288,8,34,Ra4,b'8/6k1/8/6P1/rBBb4/1p6/3RK1PP/8 w - -',Here White should play Rxd4 and after Rxb4 Rd7+ and no matter where the black king goes he has problems.  The best is Kg6 but then Bd3+ is easy for black.  If instead Kf8 Rf7+ and now if Ke8 then Rf4 with discovered threats.  So now Ke7 g6 and black queens first but black's king is in more trouble and the white king can hide from checks by running to g3.    Instead after Rxd4 Rxb4 Rd7+ Kf8 Rf7+ Kg8? Rc7+ followed by g6 will force mate.  Also after Rxd4 Rxb4 Rd7+ Kh8? Black has similar problems after Bd5 g2 g6 threatening mate in 1.

The best move in this position is actually Ke1 and black would follow with Qh4+. White is in deep trouble now any inaccurate move would be devastating. Capturing the knight with rook would be a blunder...

His bishop is pinned (as is Black's) and his king is exposed (though not quite as bad as Black's).  White can bring his queen into the action again pretty quickly.  The real advantage for White is his rook is on an open file while Black's rook is trapped and useless.

Bb4 forces white to move Pc3 which white wants to do anyway and then black must withdraw.  The upshot is that white develops his position while black moves the same piece a couple of times.

See when black moved his Knight to e4 his g7 Bishop was lined up for my c3 Knight. We see what happened next. Sounds like a simple exchange but not exactly. I can't take black's LSB (Light Spaced Bishop) because his DSB (Dark Spaced Bishop) now targets my a1 rook. Of course I will move my rook. That move I made at move 9 did allow black to start to gain a bit of an advantage but it could be worse. You will see the other reason why the move 9 move was an inaccuracy in a moment. 
582,21,17,1Rb1,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p2b2/2P1P3/1Pb1PN1P/P3BPP1/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',Of course as I said white will protect his rook. 
583,21,18,1Bxe4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P1b3/1Pb1PN1P/P3BPP1/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',Here's the final result of white's inaccuracy earlier. Black gains a free pawn. It may only be a pawn and not matter that much but since black is clearly getting a positional advantage you can see now how 9. d3 was an inaccuracy. There is still plenty of game to go. 
584,21,19,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P1b3/1PbBPN1P/P4PP1/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',It's pretty obvious to me that black plans to exchange pieces. It's not always the case though so I play this move to ensure the exchange. 
585,21,20,1Bxf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P5/1PbBPb1P/P4PP1/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',As I expected. I would of thought 12. Bxd3 would of been better actually but then again black is attacking king-side. 
586,21,21,1Qxf3,b'r2q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P5/1PbBPQ1P/P4PP1/1RB2RK1 b - -',I knew it was better to keep a good pawn structure for my king thus I took with the queen instead of the g2 pawn. 
587,21,22,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/pp2p2p/2np2p1/2p2p2/2P3P1/1PbBPQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - g3',This probably was not the best move. I didn't see much better at the time. 
588,21,23,1e5,b'r2q1rk1/pp5p/2np2p1/2p1pp2/2P3P1/1PbBPQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 w - e6',I can't help but notice that black is pushing me back some and pushing in closer. 
589,21,24,1gxf5,b'r2q1rk1/pp5p/2np2p1/2p1pP2/2P5/1PbBPQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - -',I decide to take with the pawn. 
590,21,25,1gxf5,b'r2q1rk1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pp2/2P5/1PbBPQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 w - -',Obviously black does take back. 
591,21,26,1Bxf5,b'r2q1rk1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pB2/2P5/1Pb1PQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - -',I lasted 15 moves without any big mistakes. Against a player rated around 2200 I think that is pretty good. This is where white's downfall begins though with the blunder (a.k.a. big mistake) just made here. Just glancing over this position you probably can't see why this is such a blunder. The reason is that now the LSB is lost. If you still don't see it then simply look at the next move. 
592,21,27,1Qg5+,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pBq1/2P5/1Pb1PQ1P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 w - -',Now that black can attack the king with a check white must defend. The thing is white can't defend by using their LSB unless they want to lose their queen. Obviously that is not the case. There is no way to save the bishop thus the move made before is a blunder not only because now black gains a big material advantage but also a greater position against white. 
593,21,28,1Qg4,b'r4rk1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pBq1/2P3Q1/1Pb1P2P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - -',I could of moved the queen to other positions but I figured staying with the bishop like this was best. 
594,21,29,1Rxf5,b'r5k1/pp5p/2np4/2p1prq1/2P3Q1/1Pb1P2P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 w - -',The bishop goes as expected. 
595,21,30,1e4,b'r5k1/pp5p/2np4/2p1prq1/2P1P1Q1/1Pb4P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - -',I decide to attack black's rook and queen. I think we all know the only move black will make next. 
596,21,31,1Qxg4+,b'r5k1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pr2/2P1P1q1/1Pb4P/P4P2/1RB2RK1 w - -',A queens exchange of course. No other move would of been optional for black. 
597,21,32,1hxg4,b'r5k1/pp5p/2np4/2p1pr2/2P1P1P1/1Pb5/P4P2/1RB2RK1 b - -',Well we can see now that black is winning but the game is only about half over. 
598,21,33,2f3,b'r5k1/pp5p/2np1r2/2p1p3/2P1P1P1/1Pb2P2/P7/1RB2RK1 b - -',White builds up their defenses with what they still have. 
599,21,34,2Nd4,b'r5k1/pp5p/3p1r2/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1Pb2P2/P7/1RB2RK1 w - -',With black already in white's territory white has limited options.

601,21,36,2Raf8,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p1r2/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1Pb2P2/P5K1/1RB2R2 w - -',Obviously the f3 pawn is now lost. 
602,21,37,2Bb2,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p1r2/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1Pb2P2/PB4K1/1R3R2 b - -',I decide to attack black's bishop hoping to give me more room to maneuver. This is actually a mistake. Again I will explain why through the next few moves. 
603,21,38,2Bxb2,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p1r2/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P3P2/Pb4K1/1R3R2 w - -',I at first found it interesting black did not play Rxf3 to give his Bishop protection. Of course there is nothing wrong with a fair exchange instead. Now that I think about it though giving up more of my pieces probably isn't the best idea but I couldn't think of much else. Black must of taken opportunity of that but of course I don't know that exactly but I'd say it's most likely. This is why the previous move by white as a mistake. You will see in a few moves the outcome of doing so. 
604,21,39,2Rxb2,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p1r2/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P3P2/PR4K1/5R2 b - -',Of course I take with my own rook. 
605,21,40,2Rf6xf3,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P3r2/PR4K1/5R2 w - -',Now the pawn is taken and lost. 
606,21,41,2Rbf2,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P3r2/P4RK1/5R2 b - -',I decide to get my both of my rooks involved here again not thinking about keeping my pieces on the board. 
607,21,42,2Rf3xf2+,b'5rk1/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P6/P4rK1/5R2 w - -',No surprise there an exchange. 
608,21,43,Rxf2+,b'6k1/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P6/P4rK1/8 w - -',I'm not surprised it was a double exchange. 
609,21,44,2Kxf2,b'6k1/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P6/P4K2/8 b - -',Well now white has no strong pieces. Just a few pawns and their king. It is just a matter of time now. Now we see why 22. Bb2 was a mistake. White basically has nothing left but black has plenty left compared to white. 
610,21,45,2Kg7,b'8/pp4kp/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P6/P4K2/8 w - -',Black now gets their king involved as well. There is no stopping an eventual pawn promotion. White will play on still. I see how long I can last and I always feel the other side could make a mistake but I knew then as well as I know now that I'm against a grand-master so the chances that they'll make a mistake is pretty much zero to none lol. 
611,21,46,2Ke3,b'8/pp4kp/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1P1/1P2K3/P7/8 b - -',Not much white can do. 
612,21,47,Kg5,b'8/pp5p/3p4/2p1p1k1/2PnP1P1/1P1K4/P7/8 w - -',Of course the g4 pawn is lost. 
613,21,48,3Kd3,b'8/pp5p/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP1k1/1P1K4/P7/8 b - -',Whit is simply going back and forth now but it is obvious which pawn will be promoted. It is over for white of course but the inevitable could of still of been prolonged. This move is a blunder because now there is no way to stop the h7 pawn from promoting. Kf2 would of been a way better move. 
614,21,49,3h5,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p2p/2PnP1k1/1P1K4/P7/8 w - h6',Again there is no hope in stopping that pawn now. 
615,21,50,Kg3,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p2p/2PnP3/1P2K1k1/P7/8 w - -',Black obviously wants to make sure white does not try to stop the pawn from promoting. I would expect no less. 
616,21,51,3Kc3,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP2p/1PK3k1/P7/8 b - -',At this point I felt I should get away from that area. There aren't really any good moves for white now. 
617,21,52,h1=Q,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p3/2PnP3/KP4k1/P7/7q w - -',The promotion. It's almost over. 
618,21,53,Qc1,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p3/K1PnP3/1P4k1/P7/2q5 w - -',Black prepares for the mate. 
619,21,54,3a3,b'8/pp6/3p4/2p1p3/K1PnP3/PP4k1/8/2q5 b - -',This was the the only reasonable move for white. 
620,21,55,3b6,b'8/p7/1p1p4/2p1p3/K1PnP3/PP4k1/8/2q5 w - -',Well now white can only make one move. Thus it is over but I let it play out until the end. Mate in 2. 
621,21,56,3b4,b'8/p7/1p1p4/2p1p3/KPPnP3/P5k1/8/2q5 b - -',Mate in 1.

This g7-g5 isn't of course a new idea. Similar moves exist in the main line of this opening but with the centre closed (pawns on e4 and e5) it is much stronger. I also had the pattern in mind because i had recently looked at a Carlsen-Nakamura game in a Sicilian Defence with more or less the same structure with

So I stopped f2-f4 once and for all. 

 The other source of counterplay is the one that my opponent actually adopted but since it involved material investment I didn't consider it particularly dangerous...

657,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As Usual.
658,23,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Not surprised that he played this.
659,23,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',On a normal basis I would've played the Ruy Lopez.  But although this is not against a person it is on the hardest level so it's as though I'm playing against a 2200+ rated player.  So I avoid the Ruy Lopez at once.
660,23,3,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',I have no idea why he wants to exchange here.
661,23,4,exd5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',But I accept because the idea is that when you're up against a stronger opponent you want to exchange often as I learned from Jack Stockel.  The idea is that the opponent is familiar with all the variations and what to do with his pieces and pawns so as long as it's level by exchanging you take him or her out of the comfort which often results in a better game.
662,23,5,Nc3,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',But exchanging in this position meant bringing the Q out early.  It was an occasion where the general opening guidelines in order to prevent the loss of a pawn but I'm still going to spend the time to develop.  And worth noting that stronger players can deviate from the principles but the ones that aren't should not deviate whatsoever as per what I learned from the Master Mater.
663,23,6,Qe6+,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Doesn't make much difference because of this move.
664,23,7,Qe2,b'r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',There are two reasons why I get out of check with my Q.  The first is to keep castling rights which I will castle in a few moves.  Second but more importantly as I could've also 5.Be2 which also allows castling is that I wanted to exchange Q's which will happen for the reason outlined earlier.  That is it's basically the equivalent to playing against a much stronger player.  
665,23,8,Bd7,b'r3kbnr/pppbpppp/2n1q3/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',To add a defender onto the b file since the N is not pinned.  But I'm still going to exchange one way or another.  However with this move black will not wind up with doubled pawns in the center when all is said and done.
666,23,9,Bb5,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1b3/1B6/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',And now that we exchanged I waste no time in pinning the N since I view it as very dangerous.  As I learned from Jack N's in a position like this can cause problems and I blundered against him and a different opponent during a team game by letting the N become too dangerous.  So this is a way to prevent that from happening.
667,23,10,Bd7,b'r3kbnr/pppbpppp/2n5/1B6/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',The best way to break the pin.  But now I can castle which was also part of my plan.
668,23,11,O-O-O,b'2kr1bnr/pppbpppp/2n5/1B6/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So does the computer.  This is a little better because castling on the other side would require the other pieces to come out so the K safe sooner.
669,23,12,d4,b'2kr1bnr/pppbpppp/2n5/1B6/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - d3',This is a center which develops and the other idea is to bring out my remaining piece so that I can connect both rooks and even double up as I've been studying.
670,23,13,f6,b'2kr1bnr/pppbp1pp/2n2p2/1B6/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Unlike before I have no idea why black played this.  But for this game after how complicated it gets I don't view any of black's moves as pointless because some of them become more dangerous then it appears.
671,23,14,1Be3,b'2kr1bnr/pppbp1pp/2n2p2/1B6/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',At last my final piece is out.
672,23,15,1Bf5,b'2kr1bnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/1B3b2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The idea is to win my c pawn.
673,23,16,1Rac1,b'2kr1bnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/1B3b2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2R2RK1 b - -',But after what happened in past games I don't allow it.
674,23,17,1e6,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/1B3b2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2R2RK1 w - -',The idea is to get more pieces out because as noted this is a center pawn and is black is preparing to bring the DSB into play.
675,23,18,1Rfd1,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/1B3b2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2RR2K1 b - -',Meanwhile I'm already coming up with plans.  Since the pieces are already developed I finally complete center control with this move.  And now my goal is to double up which is bound to happen.  I've studied past games and they often double up by bringing one R to one side before moving on a different rank.  And right behind on the same rank they put the other R behind it which will happen in a little while.
676,23,19,1Nb4,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/1B3b2/1n1P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2RR2K1 w - -',Normally I'd have no idea why black would move the same piece twice when nothing's in danger and the time could've been used to develop the other N or DSB.  But I do know what's going on because of past mistakes I've made as noted earlier.  This move makes the N more dangerous.  And the goal is to win a pawn.  In this case the c2 pawn because it's becoming coordinated with LSB so that after say ...Bxc2 if I respond with RXB black would play ...NXR not only winning a pawn but then a R for a N.  However I see black's plan.
677,23,20,1Rd2,b'2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/1B3b2/1n1P4/2N1BN2/PPPR1PPP/2R3K1 b - -',And I will not allow it.

It is a little crammed I admit since confined near the homesquare so it's a little tight and uncomfortable but black does not have a lot of choices.  The only other choice would be placing it on the rim but then I would take it with 14.Bxh6 and when 14...PXN he has doubled away from the center.  I think it has a name is called wing pawns unless I'm mixed up.  But they're doubled on the edge which is said to give black a disadvantage.  So for now this was the best place for the other N to come into play.  
679,23,22,1a3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/1B3b2/1n1P4/P1N1BN2/1PPR1PPP/2R3K1 b - -',However I'm still going to gain time.  The idea is that after the retreat it'll take longer for black to bring the remaining piece into play.
680,23,23,1Nbd5,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/1B1n1b2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PPR1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',And now I delay black's development even more by forcing another exchange with the same idea as noted earlier.
681,23,24,1c4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp3pp/4pp2/1B1n1b2/2PP4/P3BN2/1P1R1PPP/2R3K1 b - c3',Still gaining tempii so that black will have to take even longer to develop.

683,23,26,c6,b'2kr1b1r/pp4pp/2p1pp2/1B3b2/2PP4/P3PN2/1P1R2PP/2R3K1 w - -',I would've brought my remaining piece into play.  But this is very understandable.
684,23,27,1Ba4,b'2kr1b1r/pp4pp/2p1pp2/5b2/B1PP4/P3PN2/1P1R2PP/2R3K1 b - -',Most common response anyway.  But even if not it's indirectly forced to avoid losing a piece for a pawn.
685,23,28,1g5,b'2kr1b1r/pp5p/2p1pp2/5bp1/B1PP4/P3PN2/1P1R2PP/2R3K1 w - g6',I don't know why black played this.
686,23,29,1Rf2,b'2kr1b1r/pp5p/2p1pp2/5bp1/B1PP4/P3PN2/1P3RPP/2R3K1 b - -',I also could've doubled up.  However the decision was to add a defender near the K since the f pawn near is gone.  So the idea behind was K safety to prevent the risk that it'll become exposed.
687,23,30,1Bh6,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p1pp1b/5bp1/B1PP4/P3PN2/1P3RPP/2R3K1 w - -',Bringing the remaining piece into play and thus completing development.
688,23,31,2Bc2,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p1pp1b/5bp1/2PP4/P3PN2/1PB2RPP/2R3K1 b - -',The idea now is to like before exchange.
689,23,32,2Bxc2,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p1pp1b/6p1/2PP4/P3PN2/1Pb2RPP/2R3K1 w - -',Like before black accepts.  Plus when all is said I will have doubled up in the process.  Believe it or not this is what you typically see from GM's.  So in this game at least for this part I was thinking like a grandmaster.
690,23,33,g4,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p1pp1b/8/2PP2p1/P3PN2/1PR3PP/2R3K1 w - -',However I overlooked something very important.  First why did black this?  Well as we know moves aren't played just for a thrill of attacking something.  As it turns out when I retreat black is going to win two pawns as we're about to see.  So this was an important tactical motif that I missed.  On the hardest it's a mistake because against someone this strong losing a pawn is especially very dangerous.  In addition even if the N were not attacked 22.e4?? would be a blunder as the e pawn is pinned to the R so I'd lose a R for a pawn.
691,23,34,2Kf1,b'2kr3r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2PP2p1/P3b3/1PRN2PP/2R2K2 b - -',Also possible was 23.Kh1 but it looks like mate in a few moves if I do that.  He has those dangerous R's which is something to watch out for.  Normally it's not a big deal as it won't generally mate but against much stronger players this is very important.
692,23,35,2Rxd4,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2Pr2p1/P3b3/1PRN2PP/2R2K2 w - -',However this is the second pawn that I was alluding to on black's 21st move.
693,23,36,2Ke2,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2Pr2p1/P3b3/1PRNK1PP/2R5 b - -',Since black already has a noticeable advantage and nothing's being threatened now is the time to become aggressive.  So the idea isn't an attack but to put pressure not just on the B but indirectly on the d R and directly in the center since that's where I'm attacking.
694,23,37,2Bf4,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2Pr1bp1/P7/1PRNK1PP/2R5 w - -',Not only protecting the B but trying to get my h pawn in the process.  And it is very difficult to defend it in this position even though it looks very easy.  The tactical motif is even more then I thought.  You'd think well I can reattack with my g pawn but then black would win my N either with the B or d R which I am not going to allow.
695,23,38,2Nb3,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2Pr1bp1/PN6/1PR1K1PP/2R5 b - -',Therefore this is the only alternative.
696,23,39,2Re4+,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1rbp1/PN6/1PR1K1PP/2R5 w - -',However black goes to plan B which as we're about to see is very dangerous as well.  
697,23,40,2Kf2,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1rbp1/PN6/1PR2KPP/2R5 b - -',?? I also considered 26.Kd3 with the idea of an exchange.  And I would've done it earlier but now I will not as that becomes liquidation of pieces when down.  Meaning: I'm ok with pawns but I will not exchange when behind unless I get something which is not the case here.  With that it's safe to infer that this was black's plan.  However this was a blunder and that exchange had to occur as this move loses a R for a B.
698,23,41,2Be3+,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1r1p1/PN2b3/1PR2KPP/2R5 w - -',This is how.
699,23,42,2Kf1,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1r1p1/PN2b3/1PR3PP/2R2K2 b - -',Also possible were 27.Kg3 or 27.Ke2 but I would not like the checks that follow after.  That's because after studying various games that would result mate.  Well not right away but sooner especially if black were to organize the h R which would be perhaps the main risk.  So I was not going to allow that.
700,23,43,2Rxc1,b'2k4r/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1r1p1/PN6/1P4PP/2R2K2 b - -',Also possible was 28.Nxc1 but I wanted to prevent the same thing as now the risk while not immediate is ...Rd4 and if he were to double up with ...Rd8 and then the worst would be ...Rd1! which would lose a R.  That's the perfect example of where two R's on one file is extremely dangerous.  So this move stops black from the bringing a R onto the first rank even if black were to double up.
701,23,44,2Rd8,b'2kr4/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P1r1p1/PN6/1P4PP/2R2K2 w - -',Black still wants to double but with what I noted it won't be as effective.  So now I believe that I made the right choice.
702,23,45,2Nc5,b'2kr4/pp5p/2p1pp2/2N5/2P1r1p1/P7/1P4PP/2R2K2 b - -',Since I'm in bad shape the idea is putting pressure on the b file with the idea that I could soon get the R more mobile which of course won't happen.  But anything is worth a try since nothing's being threatened and am still at a disadvantage.  As we know I maintain confidence especially when in a situation like this.  In fact that is so important that I emphasize it in my club.
703,23,46,2Re5,b'2kr4/pp5p/2p1pp2/2N1r3/2P3p1/P7/1P4PP/2R2K2 w - -',!! However black sees this and goes right after the N.  But as it turns out as we'll see later on this move wins the N no matter where I move it which is why I gave it two exclamation points.  
704,23,47,3Nb3,b'2kr4/pp5p/2p1pp2/4r3/2P3p1/PN6/1P4PP/2R2K2 b - -',However I did not know that the N at the time.  Therefore I now start thinking defensively because all I know at this point is that the N is being threatened.  So I thought it could be protected.
705,23,48,3Rd3,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/4r3/2P3p1/PN1r4/1P4PP/2R2K2 w - -',Same thing as what we saw on the last move.  But I now start realizing what's going on and realize that at best I'd be forced to exchange my remaining if I am to avoid losing a free N.
706,23,49,3Rc3,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/4r3/2P3p1/PNRr4/1P4PP/5K2 b - -',Therefore I get the R out and he black gladly exchanges to exploit my weaknesses.
707,23,50,Re3,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P3p1/PNP1r3/6PP/5K2 w - -',What I realize however is that the c pawn is gone in addition to what I've already lost.
708,23,51,3h3,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/8/2P3p1/PNP1r2P/6P1/5K2 b - -',However I don't mind exchanging pawns because the idea is that it's ok to exchange pawns when behind but that it isn't good to exchange pieces.  And the reason behind this move was counterplay with a pawn chain as that is how I pulled a swindle in a past game against Jack.  However that's not going to happen here and it is an exception where exchanging pawns is a bad idea.
709,23,52,3Na5,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/N7/2P5/P1P4r/8/5K2 b - -',Knowing that he's going to get the h pawn I might as well play anything.  So I go back to square one by putting pressure on the b pawn.
710,23,53,3a4,b'2k5/pp5p/2p1pp2/N7/P1P5/2r5/8/5K2 b - -',Seeing that my a pawn is not danger I waste no time.  So I advance for protection.  However what I overlooked is how many squares my N would have.  And the answer is none because as it turns out this move traps the N.  So it is now lost no matter where it goes.  But this is not a mistake as no matter what else I would've played the N could not be protected anyway.
711,23,54,3Kc7,b'8/ppk4p/2p1pp2/N7/P1P5/2r5/8/5K2 w - -',The idea is that we're now in an endgame so the K becomes a powerful.  So now is the time to move it forward plus it adds protection his pawn structures on the a-c files allowing him to get a passed pawn.  It's not passed yet but it's a matter of time before that changes.
712,23,55,3Ke2,b'8/ppk4p/2p1pp2/N7/P1P5/2r5/4K3/8 b - -',So ignoring the N seeing it's gone I advance my K with the same idea.  Plus I am trying to get the opposition but it is too little too late.
713,23,56,3b6,b'8/p1k4p/1pp1pp2/N7/P1P5/2r5/4K3/8 w - -',Normally I don't resign until I see that mate is inevitable.  However while it's not immediate it is to follow.  For one thing black has several passed pawns whereas I have none.  And N is gone plus with those passed pawns and R it's a matter of time before he wins the pawns.  So normally I'd stay in with the idea of trying to get a stalemate but knowing that it'd be against the equivalent to a Master or even a GM I don't stand a chance.  It's lost one way or another so I resign at this point.  Now it wasn't official resignation as unlike here they don't give resign as an option but I hit escape and exited the game after recording the positions.

Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4 From about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much it being replaced by Smyslov's idea of 10....Qc7 followed by 11. Rc1 Rd8 but this was rather put out of business by 12. Bf4! so players went back to this older system. To quote from Wiki ""this was frequently played by Karpov including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov in Seville Spain is the Seville Variation after 6...Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0-0 10.0-0 Bg4 11.f3 Na5 12.Bxf7+ long thought a poor move by theory as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enough compensation for the pawn."
717,24,3,1Qd7,b'r5k1/pp1qp1bp/6p1/n1p5/3PP1P1/2P1B3/P3N1PP/R2Q1K2 w - -',In the aforementioned game white took on f1 with the queen rather than the king but it doesn't make much difference. His c4 square is now very weak but I can't play Nc4 immediately as he has Qb3 pinning my knight against my king.
718,24,4,1h3,b'r5k1/pp1qp1bp/6p1/n1p5/3PP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/R2Q1K2 b - -',White protects the g4 pawn.

721,24,7,1Qc4,b'r5k1/pp2p1bp/6p1/n1p5/2qPP1P1/2PQB2P/P3N1P1/R4K2 w - -',I offer the exchange of queens. It is unusual for the side a pawn down to offer a queen exchange. However the ending is not that bad for black. White's extra pawn is doubled and on the king-side where the king's are and it is very difficult for white to exploit this extra pawn.
722,24,8,1Qd1,b'r5k1/pp2p1bp/6p1/n1p5/2qPP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/R2Q1K2 b - -',This looks like a mistake to me. In previous games white had exchanged queens on c5. Black's knight has a tremendous square on c5 but white has the extra pawn. Chances are even. I considered retreating the queen to e6 now. I wondered if he would advance his queen again to d3 and we could just keep repeating the position and agree a draw. However I was very much aware that on board 3 and 4 we were heavily out-graded and stood very little chance. I would have to win if my team were to get anything out of this match so I played....
723,24,9,1Rd8,b'3r2k1/pp2p1bp/6p1/n1p5/2qPP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/R2Q1K2 w - -',This building up pressure on the d pawn and pinning the d pawn to the queen.
724,24,10,1Kg1,b'3r2k1/pp2p1bp/6p1/n1p5/2qPP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/R2Q2K1 b - -',He calmly moves his king to a safer square and unpinning his knight at the same time.
725,24,11,1e5,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p1p3/2qPP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/R2Q2K1 w - e6',I build up again against d4. Note how the d4 pawn is doubly pinned. It can't take on e5 or c5 as it is pinned by the rook against the white queen and it can't advance without losing his e4 pawn. The d4 pawn is now attacked by five pieces (2 pawns a bishop rook and a queen) and protected four times - so I am threatening to take it.
726,24,12,1Rc1,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p1p3/2qPP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/2RQ2K1 b - -',This move saves the d pawn as if I take on d4 he takes back with the c pawn discovering an attack on my queen with his rook. This is the key position. I looked at Qxa2 20. Ra1 Qb3 21. Qxb3+ Nxb3 22. Ra3 and at the time I thought I was losing the knight on b3. However I see now that in that position I can save it with c5-c4 or I can take on d4 which threatens his bishop on e3. This is clearly what I should have played or maybe take on d4 first with my c pawn. Either way I think black would have had an advantage. However I tried another way which just loses for me although it looks very plausible! 
727,24,13,1exd4,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p5/2qpP1P1/2P1B2P/P3N1P1/2RQ2K1 w - -',I take this way to open up my diagonal for my bishop more.
728,24,14,2cxd4,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p5/2qPP1P1/4B2P/P3N1P1/2RQ2K1 b - -',He takes back uncovering at attack on my queen. I can still take on a7 but now he can take back on c5 with his rook reducing the pressure on d4. I think the position is pretty even then but as I was saying I was playing for a win but this led to a loss.
729,24,15,2Qb4,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p5/1q1PP1P1/4B2P/P3N1P1/2RQ2K1 w - -',So I played this. I thought this position was good for me. I still have the two-way pin on the d pawn. Of course I saw that his bishop can drop back and hit my queen but what of it? I can take on d4 with my bishop. He can't then recapture with his knight as then I take back with the queen give check and follow up with QxBd2 and I am a piece up. Of course he doesn't have to capture on d4 he could simply move his king but then I move my queen and if he takes my knight I recapture with my queen. No problem there? Or is there?
730,24,16,2Bd2,b'3r2k1/pp4bp/6p1/n1p5/1q1PP1P1/7P/P2BN1P1/2RQ2K1 b - -',So he hits my queen.

735,24,21,2Qxa5,b'3r2k1/pp5p/6p1/q1p5/3bP1P1/7P/P3N1P1/2RQ3K w - -',I take back.
736,24,22,2Qb3+,b'3r2k1/pp5p/6p1/q1p5/3bP1P1/1Q5P/P3N1P1/2R4K b - -',"Ouch! That was the move I missed when I was considering my 19th move. How could I miss it when I noticed it when considering my 14th move? I put it down to two things. One ""is playing for win"". The other is ""dizziness due to success"" 0- I was getting so carried away with how I had pressure on his position and was getting my pawn back that I didn't notice this. I don't have much choice now as advancing the king loses the b7 pawn with check and moving to f8 allows his rook to come over to f1 with a killing check. I think black is lost now. "
737,24,23,2Kh8,b'3r3k/pp5p/6p1/q1p5/3bP1P1/1Q5P/P3N1P1/2R4K w - -',As I said this is the only square left.
738,24,24,2Nxd4,b'3r3k/pp5p/6p1/q1p5/3NP1P1/1Q5P/P5P1/2R4K b - -',He takes here. I make another mistake here. Taking back with the rook is pretty dreadful. After Rxd4 26.	Qxb7	Qxa2 27. Rxc5 he is threatening  Rc8 he is threatening both 28. Rc8+ forcing Qg8 and black's queen goes and if Qg8 28. Rc8 Rd8 29.	Rc7 with the dreadful threat of Qb2+ but black may be able to hold on for a bit longer. As played the c file is opened for white rook to come into the position immediately and black is lost.
739,24,25,2cxd4,b'3r3k/pp5p/6p1/q7/3pP1P1/1Q5P/P5P1/2R4K w - -',So I took this way. While studying this position I thought at first 26. Qxb7 could be met with Qb6 but then I saw that he just plays Qf7 followed by Rc7 and it is all over. Come to think of it can't he play 26. Qf7 immediately? It looks all over for me. With some relief to me he didn't play that and played.
740,24,26,2Qxb7,b'3r3k/pQ5p/6p1/q7/3pP1P1/7P/P5P1/2R4K b - -',This. I tried the one move I thought may hold on a while.
741,24,27,2Qxa2,b'3r3k/pQ5p/6p1/8/3pP1P1/7P/q5P1/2R4K w - -',This briefly restores the material balance.
742,24,28,2Rc7,b'3r3k/pQR4p/6p1/8/3pP1P1/7P/q5P1/7K b - -',With a threat to h7.

744,24,30,2Qxa7,b'3r2qk/Q1R4p/6p1/8/3pP1P1/7P/6P1/7K b - -',He is not just a pawn up his queen and rook have dominating positions.
745,24,31,2h6,b'3r2qk/Q1R5/6pp/8/3pP1P1/7P/6P1/7K w - -',Played with my next move in mind.
746,24,32,2e5,b'3r2qk/Q1R5/6pp/4P3/3p2P1/7P/6P1/7K b - -',The pawn starts to roll. This move is not necessary. He could already play the winning manoeuvre of Rf7 followed by Qe7.
747,24,33,2Qf8,b'3r1q1k/Q1R5/6pp/4P3/3p2P1/7P/6P1/7K w - -',Threatening some checks.

751,24,37,3Rd5,b'6qk/Q4R2/4P1pp/3r4/3p2P1/7P/6P1/7K w - -',I am not sure why I played this! I think I was just basically running out of moves. My king can't move. My queen can't move without allowing a quick mate. My rook can't move along the back rank without allowing Qxd4+ mating. d4-d3 allows Qa1 mating. Rd6 loses to Qc5.
752,24,38,3Qe7,b'6qk/4QR2/4P1pp/3r4/3p2P1/7P/6P1/7K b - -',He finally sees it and I resign. Many thanks for reading this annotation. Please leave your comments and rate it on the star system. Until next time dear reader!

3.  Can you take a high value piece (HVP)?
4.  [And this is critical here]  Can you prevent your opponent seizing a HVP?

Something should be done to prevent NxQb6 like Qc7 or Qd8.  Qc6 is ok too if NxPd4 then QxNa4."

776,26,6,Ke7,b'5b1r/p1N1kppp/2pp1nb1/Q3p3/6P1/5N1P/PPP2K2/R1B4R w - -',This puts the king in the path of the bishop preventing the remaining rook's egress.  On the other hand Kd87 is clearly bad for discovered check (white moves the rook).  Kd7 isn't great either but it's the only option left with a check by knight.

795,27,12,Kc8,b'2k4r/qpNbn3/8/p1bp2Np/8/6B1/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black needed to either move the king to prevent Nf7+ rook fork on the other side.  Rf8 would have been another option putting pressure on white's f pawn.

898,29,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the Open Variation the most commonly leading into the Dragon Najdorf or Classical lines.
899,29,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This leads into the Dragon-Najdorf lines.
900,29,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I'm most comfortable with this. Lately I've been wondering about another varation called the Canal-Sokolsky Attack where White plays Bb5+ here usually met by Bd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7 with White having a few options for development on his 5th... But that is an annotation for another time.
901,29,5,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This is common.
902,29,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',And of course why would you not take the pawn?
903,29,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Development and forces White to defend the pawn.
904,29,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Which I do here. White rarely has to worry about a Bb4 pin in the Sicilian anyway.
905,29,9,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',And here we begin the Najdorf variation. The Dragon Variation is more of a defensive line responding with 5... g6 planning to fianchetto his DSB and to O-O right away. The Najdorf is a lot more aggressive planning to berate White's knight via e5 but plays a6 in order to stop any of White's pieces from hitting b5...
906,29,10,Be3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',My reply is the English Attack. This is my favorite response to the Sicilian (particularly Najdorf) because I find it preserves White's ability to counter any aggressive moves from Black while still being able to advance on ground of his own. It also stops Black from moving the Queen to b6 (Qb6? Nb3!) so White's dark bishop becomes particularly powerful in these lines.
907,29,11,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This move frees Black's dark bishop and allows ...d5 to be a possible move.
908,29,12,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',And this prevents an annoying Ng4! after Black plays e5.
909,29,13,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq b6',Black decides to start a pawn storm on my knights.
910,29,14,Qd2,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I'm not overly worried about it so I just continue with my development.
911,29,15,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/8/1p1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',And he hits my knight.
912,29,16,Na4,b'rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Opening theory normally scolds us for putting knights up against a wall but this is a good square for the knight allowing White to contest much of the queenside and Black must defend carefully.
913,29,17,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Likewise this move allows development countering the influence of my Na4 and also allows defense of b4 via Rb8.
914,29,18,1O-O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',I decide now is a good time to castle.
915,29,19,1Qa5,b'r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/q7/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',This freezes the Na4 in place and threatens Qxa2. White cannot play Nc3 and the b4 pawn is further defended from a3 and c3. Now it's White's turn to defend carefully.
916,29,20,1b3,b'r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/q7/Np1NP3/1P2BP2/P1PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',The only real response.

918,29,22,1a3,b'r3kb1r/1b1n1ppp/p2ppn2/q7/Np1NP3/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',If the Black Queen has to retreat it cannot defend b4 allowing me to win the exchange. Meanwhile Black cannot exchange right now either (bxa3?? Qxa5!!).
919,29,23,1d5,b'r3kb1r/1b1n1ppp/p3pn2/q2p4/Np1NP3/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',This just dares White to exchange.
920,29,24,1e5,b'r3kb1r/1b1n1ppp/p3pn2/q2pP3/Np1N4/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',I'm fine thanks. This forces Ng8 because Nh5 lets White play g4 and the knight falls to the pawns.
921,29,25,1Nxe5,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p3pn2/q2pn3/Np1N4/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',This is a mistake however- the first of many that spirals Black into a nightmare of mishaps. Black saw that the knight would have to retreat but didn't understand what made this gambit so dangerous in the first place. Can you see it?
922,29,26,1Nxe6,b'r3kb1r/1b3ppp/p3Nn2/q2pn3/Np6/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',For starters the pawn wasn't dropped on e5. Black cannot capture this knight without paying dearly for it. A certain attack is made possible if Black does not give up his pawn on d4 right now...
923,29,27,1fxe6,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/p3pn2/q2pn3/Np6/PP2BP2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',...Which he does not. My trap now springs into action.
924,29,28,1Bb6,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pB2pn2/q2pn3/Np6/PP3P2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',And the door slams shut on the Black Queen's fate.
925,29,29,1Qxa4,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pB2pn2/3pn3/qp6/PP3P2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',A desperate exchange to avoid losing more material in the short term. 
926,29,30,1bxa4,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pB2pn2/3pn3/Pp6/P4P2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq -',Forced on my end. Now I have to figure out how to preserve my material advantage.
927,29,31,1bxa3,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pB2pn2/3pn3/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq -',I don't like this move if only because I think Black can do better like with Nfd7. It forces my bishop to retreat and I wouldn't be able to play Qxb4 because Black would just play Bxb4. So while I have to be VERY careful about ignoring the pawn nearing promotion right next to my King on a1 I kinda felt rightfully so that the threat of a1=Q would not activate before I could advance counterthreats of my own.
928,29,32,1Re1,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pB2pn2/3pn3/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K1RB1R b kq -',Starting with the fact that both e5 and e6 have no defenders and lie in front of the Black King.
929,29,33,1Nc6,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pBn1pn2/3p4/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K1RB1R w kq -',Another mistake. This makes my next move even stronger. Much better was Ned7.
930,29,34,1Rxe6+,b'r3kb1r/1b4pp/pBn1Rn2/3p4/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K2B1R b kq -',Being without a Queen while your enemy has one means death if your King gets exposed...
931,29,35,1Kf7,b'r4b1r/1b3kpp/pBn1Rn2/3p4/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K2B1R w - -',Black wanted to shoo the rook away but I don't care about my rooks this game.
932,29,36,1Rxf6+,b'r4b1r/1b3kpp/pBn2R2/3p4/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K2B1R b - -',Much more important to me is that his king is out in the open for my Queen to harass him with. The fewer defenders he has the better I'll do with that scale of advantage.
933,29,37,1gxf6,b'r4b1r/1b3k1p/pBn2p2/3p4/P7/p4P2/2PQ2PP/2K2B1R w - -',As for this I see why Black is reluctant to capture with the King but staying there allows for...
934,29,38,2Qxd5+,b'r4b1r/1b3k1p/pBn2p2/3Q4/P7/p4P2/2P3PP/2K2B1R b - -',This is yet -another- reason why Nc6 should never have been played instead of Ned7.
935,29,39,2Kg7,b'r4b1r/1b4kp/pBn2p2/3Q4/P7/p4P2/2P3PP/2K2B1R w - -',The only square where I can't force Mate in the next 10 or so moves.
936,29,40,2Bc4,b'r4b1r/1b4kp/pBn2p2/3Q4/P1B5/p4P2/2P3PP/2K4R b - -',Not that it matters. GK puts me at +14.00 at this point and Black's moves are pretty much forced to avoid Mate from this position forward.
937,29,41,2Be7,b'r6r/1b2b1kp/pBn2p2/3Q4/P1B5/p4P2/2P3PP/2K4R w - -',And this wasn't one of them so we have a fun Mate in 2 coming right up.

941,30,0,Bb2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Ok. This is nothing bad for white he just looks for a transposition. But I decided to test his center...

943,30,2,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/3p4/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Again at the same point. 
944,30,3,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/3p4/1P1P4/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Of course black can't hold this pawn for too long but if Nf3 B or pawn c5. 
945,30,4,Bb4+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/1b1p4/1P1P4/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',I'm glad if he plays c3: I will not have to protect anymore the pawn and a piece will be pinned as a result.

947,30,6,Bc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/3p4/1PbP4/PBPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',White will be very surprised. I will lose that pawn but I think that the tempoes will be enough for me to compensate. 
948,30,7,Nc4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2N5/1PpP4/P1P2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Ne4 and I would have been glad if he takes the pawn and Qf6. Just to force him to play defensively. (Do not try this at home :-)

In that I gave up bishop for knight to gain and pawn and then I prevented him from play the freeing c6-c5 and kept the position closed so that my knight was far better than his bishop. This game is the reverse. He gives up bishop for knight and the open position favours my bishop over his knight.
1013,32,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He prevents e4
1014,32,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',This is standard
1015,32,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Showing a preference for the Nimzo-Indian or the Queen's Indian.

1033,32,21,1cxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/4pn2/8/2Bp4/P1P1PN2/4QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',This move takes us out of the opening databases. Instead b6 or e5 are normally played in this position. The problem with this move is that it is opening up the position somewhat for my two bishops. Black should be trying to keep the position closed.
1034,32,22,1cxd4,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/4pn2/8/2BP4/P3PN2/4QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',So I take back.

1039,32,27,1Qd6,b'r4rk1/pb1n1ppp/1p1qpn2/8/2BP4/P3PN2/1B2QPPP/2R2RK1 w - -',So the queen runs.
1040,32,28,1Ne5,b'r4rk1/pb1n1ppp/1p1qpn2/4N3/2BP4/P3P3/1B2QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Now if he takes the knight I take back with the pawn and fork his queen and knight.

1052,32,40,2Rce1,b'2rr1nk1/pb3ppp/1p1qp3/1B6/3PP3/P4PP1/1B2Q2P/4RRK1 b - -',My plan is to build up on the king-side. As such I don't want the exchange pieces so I avoid rook exchanges on the c file. I plan to prevent him infiltrating on the c file by playing Bb5-d3 and then my bishops cover the infiltration squares.
1053,32,41,2Qe7,b'2rr1nk1/pb2qppp/1p2p3/1B6/3PP3/P4PP1/1B2Q2P/4RRK1 w - -',He starts wasting moves.

1058,32,46,2Qh5,b'2rr2k1/pbqn1ppp/1p2p3/7Q/3PPP2/P2B2P1/1B5P/4RRK1 b - -',So I start to probe the king-side.
1059,32,47,2f6,b'2rr2k1/pbqn2pp/1p2pp2/7Q/3PPP2/P2B2P1/1B5P/4RRK1 w - -',Blunting the effect of my Bb2 bishop but making his e6 pawn weaker.
1060,32,48,2Rec1,b'2rr2k1/pbqn2pp/1p2pp2/7Q/3PPP2/P2B2P1/1B5P/2R2RK1 b - -',So I hit his queen.

1065,32,53,2Kh8,b'1qrr3k/p2n2pp/1p2Bp2/7Q/3PbP2/P5P1/1B5P/2R2RK1 w - -',So the king has to come this way.

1183,34,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',"But we won't be seeing a Queen's Gambit this match. In fact I don't even know the name of this kind of opening at all. Gameknot calls this ""The Stonewall Attack"". I've rarely ever encountered this."
1184,34,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I'm walking in blind so I go with a move I feel is just safer to do in unusual openings.
1185,34,4,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',And we transpose back into a Queen's Gambit Declined. I can relax a little.
1186,34,5,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So maybe I can play this guy like my other encounters against this opening...
1187,34,6,a3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Not a chance. I've never seen a QGD go this way either.
1188,34,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',And I say screw it. I'm just going to keep developing.
1189,34,8,dxc5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',He captures. The GK Database says that the position here is very strong for Black. But I usually see a knight push before this pawn goes down. Notice how White has only moved pawns at this point.
1190,34,9,Bxc5,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I have to exchange but I've still hesitated already for a lot of the match. It's taken me 30 seconds to proceed this way whereas White has taken only 5 seconds out of his clock after this next move:
1191,34,10,b4,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq b3',He is still continuing to be very aggressive with his pawn pushes but I can't see any problem with his moves right now. The tempo is bound to run out if he won't push out a back rank piece yet...
1192,34,11,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',And of course a full retreat would be unacceptable. GK says I still have a slight edge.
1193,34,12,Bb2,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Not up for playing 7. c5? After coming all this way? Not sure how I feel about White right now.
1194,34,13,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQ -',There's no way I want my king near this queenside action so I tuck him away at once.
1195,34,14,Nf3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',White continues to develop.
1196,34,15,dxc4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',With all these queenside pawns in the way of my development I move to exchange the queens thinking I've just gained a pawn after ...b5! Even if I wasn't planning that attack the threat of c5 shutting down my Queenside back pieces is too great and this pawn needed to die.
1197,34,16,Qxd8,b'rnbQ1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',And then I quickly found out that I don't have the time to play b5. C'est la vie.
1198,34,17,Rxd8,b'rnbr2k1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',Forced.
1199,34,18,1Bxc4,b'rnbr2k1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',Obvious because it allows O-O and more development.
1200,34,19,1a6,b'rnbr2k1/1p2bppp/p3pn2/8/1PB5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Still planning b5. I need some sort of tempo against White after he castles.
1201,34,20,1Nc3,b'rnbr2k1/1p2bppp/p3pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/1B3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I think the plan here was to strengthen b5 but I think Nbd2 would have been stronger...
1202,34,21,1b5,b'rnbr2k1/4bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1PB5/P1N1PN2/1B3PPP/R3K2R w KQ b6',With only back rank defenders it's obvious that the bishop always had to move somewhere.
1203,34,22,1Be2,b'rnbr2k1/4bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',It retreats here. Would Bb3 or Ba2 be worth considering? My kingside pawns are strong but the bishop is still constrained both ways here.
1204,34,23,1Bb7,b'rn1r2k1/1b2bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I seize the light diagonal strengthening attacks after he castles.
1205,34,24,1O-O,b'rn1r2k1/1b2bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 b - -',He figures he should do it now instead of as a response to something later.
1206,34,25,1Nd5,b'rn1r2k1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1p1n4/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',If White does e4 then after my Nxc3 White plays Bxc3 losing the e pawn to Bxe4. It also allows me to get rid of his knight if I decide I hate it too much.
1207,34,26,1Rfd1,b'rn1r2k1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1p1n4/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',Trying to establish the threat on the d file if I exchange the knights but both of our bishops are guarding the d-back ranks so both threats aren't really warranted to either of us.
1208,34,27,1Nd7,b'r2r2k1/1b1nbppp/p3p3/1p1n4/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',Still I want to join my knights at the center. I lean more to playing Ndb6 instead of Ndf6 because if I can safely play f6 I have a lead against his kingside pawns for quite a bit of time. Ndb6 also has a threat against White's a4.
1209,34,28,1Nxd5,b'r2r2k1/1b1nbppp/p3p3/1p1N4/1P6/P3PN2/1B2BPPP/R2R2K1 b - -',He agrees that my knights have been bothering him for too long now.
1210,34,29,1Bxd5,b'r2r2k1/3nbppp/p3p3/1p1b4/1P6/P3PN2/1B2BPPP/R2R2K1 w - -',So I bother him with an equally powerful bishop. Both my bishops are causing him a lot of grief at this point. But notice that if he plays 16. Bd4 (for whatever reason) then if I did play Nf6 the position is perfectly symmetrical on White's 17th move. It means I need to find a new edge on this board soon.
1211,34,30,1Rd2,b'r2r2k1/3nbppp/p3p3/1p1b4/1P6/P3PN2/1B1RBPPP/R5K1 b - -',He decides he wants to stack the rooks against the d file instead. Obviously Bd4 wasn't an actual move worth considering (loses after ...e5) but could White played have played a4 or h3?
1212,34,31,1f6,b'r2r2k1/3nb1pp/p3pp2/1p1b4/1P6/P3PN2/1B1RBPPP/R5K1 w - -',I continue with my plan to strengthen my kingside situation. I could have played Nb6 right now but I didn't want to deal with g7 being threatened or the knight moving to e5 to annoy my pieces.
1213,34,32,1Rad1,b'r2r2k1/3nb1pp/p3pp2/1p1b4/1P6/P3PN2/1B1RBPPP/3R2K1 b - -',The stacked rooks aside he's throwing them at a bishop-pawn pair. Probably planning e4.
1214,34,33,1Nb6,b'r2r2k1/4b1pp/pn2pp2/1p1b4/1P6/P3PN2/1B1RBPPP/3R2K1 w - -',But not that e4 matters after this point because I can safely take it and if Rxd8+ I have the bishop protecting f6 and d8 from that square. White's attack is still completely pointless and I felt as though I had a clear tempo advantage over White at this point. So what should I do with it?
1215,34,34,1Ne1,b'r2r2k1/4b1pp/pn2pp2/1p1b4/1P6/P3P3/1B1RBPPP/3RN1K1 b - -',White agrees that the f6-e6 pawns are too much to deal with and would rather not move the d rooks to reposition it. Freeing the f pawn for White I can't say this is a bad move for him at all.
1216,34,35,1Nc4,b'r2r2k1/4b1pp/p3pp2/1p1b4/1Pn5/P3P3/1B1RBPPP/3RN1K1 w - -',Now he either loses his strong bishop defender or the rooks must separate anyway.
1217,34,36,1Bxc4,b'r2r2k1/4b1pp/p3pp2/1p1b4/1PB5/P3P3/1B1R1PPP/3RN1K1 b - -',He really wants this attack so he sets out to fight both my powerful bishops.
1218,34,37,1Bxc4,b'r2r2k1/4b1pp/p3pp2/1p6/1Pb5/P3P3/1B1R1PPP/3RN1K1 w - -',White's queenside is now shut down. He has to contest my kingside or find a way around.
1219,34,38,2Rd2d7,b'r2r2k1/3Rb1pp/p3pp2/1p6/1Pb5/P3P3/1B3PPP/3RN1K1 b - -',? - I don't know what this was. Probably a misclick?
1220,34,39,2Rxd7,b'r5k1/3rb1pp/p3pp2/1p6/1Pb5/P3P3/1B3PPP/3RN1K1 w - -',I complete the exchange anyway.
1221,34,40,Kf8,b'r4k2/3Rb1pp/p3pp2/1p6/1Pb5/P3P3/1B3PPP/4N1K1 w - -',Both moves practically forced. 
1222,34,41,2Bd4,b'r4k2/3Rb1pp/p3pp2/1p6/1PbB4/P3P3/5PPP/4N1K1 b - -',It's a good square but I don't see the point of it coming in my area of the board at this time.
1223,34,42,2e5,b'r4k2/3Rb1pp/p4p2/1p2p3/1PbB4/P3P3/5PPP/4N1K1 w - -',So I force it to move again while further developing my pawns.
1224,34,43,2Bb6,b'r4k2/3Rb1pp/pB3p2/1p2p3/1Pb5/P3P3/5PPP/4N1K1 b - -',He was trying to stop Rd8 but I didn't think it was nearly as powerful at the time. Is there a line that would force Black coming out with a clear advantage?
1225,34,44,2h6,b'r4k2/3Rb1p1/pB3p1p/1p2p3/1Pb5/P3P3/5PPP/4N1K1 w - -',More development.
1226,34,45,2Nf3,b'r4k2/3Rb1p1/pB3p1p/1p2p3/1Pb5/P3PN2/5PPP/6K1 b - -',The knight clearly needs to help the other two pieces or White's finished.
1227,34,46,2g5,b'r4k2/3Rb3/pB3p1p/1p2p1p1/1Pb5/P3PN2/5PPP/6K1 w - g6',My pawns are getting closer and allowing my king to have more flight squares.
1228,34,47,2Nd2,b'r4k2/3Rb3/pB3p1p/1p2p1p1/1Pb5/P3P3/3N1PPP/6K1 b - -',It's still going to be at least three more moves before that knight finds influence on my king.
1229,34,48,2Kf7,b'r7/3Rbk2/pB3p1p/1p2p1p1/1Pb5/P3P3/3N1PPP/6K1 w - -',But I decide to do something about the attack now. I COULD have but this was simply stupid and fatal. Much MUCH better was Ke8 but I was greedy and didn't think Ke6 was dangerous.
1230,34,49,2Bc5,b'r7/3Rbk2/p4p1p/1pB1p1p1/1Pb5/P3P3/3N1PPP/6K1 b - -',And it wouldn't have been but the sad part was that I remembered why it was a bad square for the king back on 21 ...Kf8 and just forgotten about the pin. Now the pin is even more deadly.
1231,34,50,2Re8,b'4r3/3Rbk2/p4p1p/1pB1p1p1/1Pb5/P3P3/3N1PPP/6K1 w - -',White playing Ra7 would be better for me at this point.
1232,34,51,2Nxc4,b'4r3/3Rbk2/p4p1p/1pB1p1p1/1PN5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',At first I didn't understand the exchange but in case you don't can you see what White's plan is?
1233,34,52,2Rc7,b'4r3/2R1bk2/p4p1p/2B1p1p1/1Pp5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',It was a pawn drop. At this stage in the game that is a problem that I need to dispute right now.
1234,34,53,2Ke6,b'4r3/2R1b3/p3kp1p/2B1p1p1/1Pp5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',If Rc6+ I play Kd7! White has to retreat the rook and capture at a6 but then I can rescue the pawn after Bxc5 and then after bxc5 I play Rc8. With my king closer to my pawn than his king to his my pawn would promote first and I would win.
1235,34,54,2Bxe7,b'4r3/2R1B3/p3kp1p/4p1p1/1Pp5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',But again I'm too greedy. This saves White and confirms that I have to face the material disadvantage. I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
1236,34,55,2Rxe7,b'8/2R1r3/p3kp1p/4p1p1/1Pp5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',Forced.
1237,34,56,3Rxc4,b'8/4r3/p3kp1p/4p1p1/1PR5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',Well what do I do now?
1238,34,57,3Kd5,b'8/4r3/p4p1p/3kp1p1/1PR5/P3P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',I kick the rook out. If Rc5+ my King lands at d6. That would allow me to play Rc7 after he retreats and forces a rook exchange or else I would have mate (31. Rc5+ Kd6 Rc2 Rc7! Re2?! Rc1# fcd) and if White tried to play Rd2+ my king would retreat to c6 then b6 still fully allowing me enough time to drive the rook out to claim the queenside pawns.
1239,34,58,3Rc2,b'8/4r3/p4p1p/3kp1p1/1P6/P3P3/2R2PPP/6K1 b - -',But my opponent sees all of this even more quickly than I do. The only thing I can do now is hope to keep my king near the exchanges. I'm almost certain that his true skill level is probably equal if not a bit higher than mine at this point.
1240,34,59,3f5,b'8/4r3/p6p/3kppp1/1P6/P3P3/2R2PPP/6K1 w - -',Another mistake. I think Kd6 would have been better and I just didn't want to pull my king back at this point so I just charged with the pawns.
1241,34,60,3f3,b'8/4r3/p6p/3kppp1/1P6/P3PP2/2R3PP/6K1 b - -',Dare I move to e4?
1242,34,61,3Re6,b'8/8/p3r2p/3kppp1/1P6/P3PP2/2R3PP/6K1 w - -',Perhaps I should have because I don't see how the rook is a threat now that I look again.
1243,34,62,3Kf2,b'8/8/p3r2p/3kppp1/1P6/P3PP2/2R2KPP/8 b - -',[Okay Rick you should really move that pawn to e4 before I do...]
1244,34,63,3Rc6,b'8/8/p1r4p/3kppp1/1P6/P3PP2/2R2KPP/8 w - -',But rook exchanges!!!
1245,34,64,3e4+,b'8/8/p1r4p/3kppp1/1P2P3/P4P2/2R2KPP/8 b - -',Yeah. Rc6 proved to be my undoing. If I dare exchange and capture the e4 pawn again I lose my rook. Stupid stupid stupid. :(
1246,34,65,3Rd2+,b'8/8/p1rk3p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P7/3R1KPP/8 b - -',So Kd6 got forced upon me and I should have played it awhile ago. Now this rook check comes in and my tempo advantage melted before my eyes. Why? Because my clock was under 3 minutes at this point. White has a decisive advantage at this point.
1247,34,66,3Ke6,b'8/8/p1r1k2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P7/3R1KPP/8 w - -',It doesn't stop me from making one last desperate push for the kingside.
1248,34,67,3Rd3,b'8/8/p1r1k2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P2R4/5KPP/8 b - -',Stopping my own Rc3 which would have been wonderful.
1249,34,68,3Rd6,b'8/8/p2rk2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P2R4/5KPP/8 w - -',I want his rook gone and he knows it.
1250,34,69,3Ke3,b'8/8/p2rk2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P2RK3/6PP/8 b - -',So he lets me have it.
1251,34,70,3Rxd3+,b'8/8/p3k2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P2rK3/6PP/8 w - -',I don't even care anymore if his king is where it should be. I'm still pushing ahead.
1252,34,71,3Kxd3,b'8/8/p3k2p/4p1p1/1P2P3/P2K4/6PP/8 b - -',Now it's all a matter of time to see who gets to h2 first.
1253,34,72,3g4,b'8/8/p3k2p/4p3/1P2P1p1/P2K4/6PP/8 w - -',This allows my king to step on g5 first.
1254,34,73,4g3,b'8/8/p3k2p/4p3/1P2P1p1/P2K2P1/7P/8 b - -',This stops me from hitting from h4 right away.
1255,34,74,4Kc4,b'8/8/p4k1p/4p3/1PK1P1p1/P5P1/7P/8 b - -',I think he's trying to go after a6...
1256,34,75,4Kd5,b'8/8/p6p/3Kp1k1/1P2P1p1/P5P1/7P/8 b - -',but in reality he wanted e5. But why?
1257,34,76,4h5,b'8/8/p7/3Kp1kp/1P2P1p1/P5P1/7P/8 w - -',Maybe I could beat him to h2 first. Maybe he made a mistake?
1258,34,77,4Kxe5,b'8/8/p7/4K1kp/1P2P1p1/P5P1/7P/8 b - -',But no. He didn't. I was entirely wrong about the end position. Now I've realized that I was just one tempo too short of slipping my king through the door.
1259,34,78,4e5,b'8/8/p7/4P3/1P3Kp1/P6k/7P/8 b - -',And here is the resulting punishment of it. White's king has trapped mine in a corner and my material disadvantage makes it impossible for me to force White to move to h3. I resign here as Mate is inevitably sure to follow at this point. Such a great game but a poor finish on my part. :(

I spent some time checking for squares to keep my queen active and after noticing Ng3 I decided that the queen had to be able to move to h5 in one turn.

1317,38,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I try a Scotch opening for this match. It's a been a long time since I've used this but I find it a touch more aggressive for White than the Four Knights approach. I was interested to see how a match against a skilled player would go for me as I didn't feel like playing as passive this time.
1318,38,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He exchanges as per the main line.
1319,38,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is usual for White to do.
1320,38,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',For Black not so much. I normally see Black succeeding more with the Nf6 line as the c6 knight can keep the Queen at bay from exchanges whereas now I might be able to get away with pulling her out. This is more aggressive than I'm used to.
1321,38,8,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',So my queen takes the center.
1322,38,9,c5,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq c6',Black is still opting for more aggressive development. I had to think for a few seconds.
1323,38,10,Qc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',Qd1 would waste moves on my tempo. Qd5 could be chased by Nf6 and any 4th-rank square could allow Black to develop more pawns while I draw my queen away. While this does block both the c-pawn and Nc3 I felt this was the most logical move on my part to allow for more development on my end.
1324,38,11,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Black plans to stake a claim to the center with better central pawns than White can offer. It works.
1325,38,12,Be3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2Q1B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',So I plan to fight back with back-rank piece development starting with this bishop as this will give a possibly needed Qd2 more freedom. I need not worry about Bb4 for the next bit of time.
1326,38,13,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2Q1B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',He hits my e-pawn and strengthens a possible d5 after his O-O.
1327,38,14,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBB3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',I don't want to do f3 just yet. I haven't fully figured out which way I want to castle yet and I don't want to indicate a forced direction by pushing the other six pawns too soon.
1328,38,15,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBB3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',Black however clearly gets more out of castling short for this match.

My king is not in danger for the time being and I want to give myself some sort of edge on the board once we decide to put the kings away in a corner. Is there another case I could make to do O-O-O instead?
1330,38,17,b6,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',He decides to defend the attack. Even so I feel as though 9 ...d5 would have been stronger here. It would have centralized his pawns even further and there wouldn't be much for me to do about it.
1331,38,18,1O-O,b'r1bqk2r/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',With something going on in the board now I move to hide the kings.
1332,38,19,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',He obliges probably wanting to see what I plan on doing.

I had also planned to move my queen to an undetermined square later on so that I can plan c4 and stop any pawn storms from ruining my defenses. I'm not as sure anymore if this was the right idea to have however. What do you think?
1334,38,21,1bxc5,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN3RK1 w - -',Anyway he chooses to keep the pawns centralized. Definitely stronger than dxc5.
1335,38,22,1f3,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBBP2/P1P3PP/RN3RK1 b - -',I know e4 is about to be pressured so I opt to give it more defenses right now.
1336,38,23,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBBP2/P1P3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',He develops his LSB and adds even more pressure to e4.

I wanted my queen on the long diagonal because I believed I had the means to build threats on d5 e6 and f7 without hindering rooks on either d1 or e1. I'll get punished for this in a second.
1338,38,25,1Qc7,b'r4rk1/pbq1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1Q1BBP2/P1P3PP/RN3RK1 w - -',Stopping Qxb7 an attack I wasn't even intending to build. He sees a much better move next turn.

1341,38,28,1Nc3,b'1r3rk1/pbq1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P1P3/1QNBBP2/P5PP/R4RK1 b - -',Another mistake on my part. This adds another defender to e4 and another threat to d5 but I should have played Qc2 first followed by this.

1345,38,32,1Qxd3,b'1r3rk1/p1q1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/2NQBP2/P5PP/R4RK1 b - -',Now my queen goes here still well in front of my rooks. I know I need to develop my pieces a little more but Black is about to attack yet again.
1346,38,33,1Nd7,b'1r3rk1/p1qnbppp/3p4/2p5/2P5/2NQBP2/P5PP/R4RK1 w - -',-Or worse. Black probably realized that I wasn't comfortable with my situation and wanted to adjust a little more for stronger points of attacks now that my central pawns and queen pawns are neutralized.
1347,38,34,1Rfe1,b'1r3rk1/p1qnbppp/3p4/2p5/2P5/2NQBP2/P5PP/R3R1K1 b - -',I cannot allow Black to seize the e-file without issue.
1348,38,35,1Ne5,b'1r3rk1/p1q1bppp/3p4/2p1n3/2P5/2NQBP2/P5PP/R3R1K1 w - -',And he targets the queen probably hoping to develop more pieces in chasing her a little further.
1349,38,36,1Qf1,b'1r3rk1/p1q1bppp/3p4/2p1n3/2P5/2N1BP2/P5PP/R3RQK1 b - -',However I'm pretty happy with her right here for the time being. I don't have to fully retreat just yet and I have a certain idea in mind with the board like this.
1350,38,37,1Bf6,b'1r3rk1/p1q2ppp/3p1b2/2p1n3/2P5/2N1BP2/P5PP/R3RQK1 w - -',But my tempo is still a bit too far behind Black. This strengthens Rfe8 and I didn't even notice what else this long diagonal offered Black for this game...
1351,38,38,2Nd5,b'1r3rk1/p1q2ppp/3p1b2/2pNn3/2P5/4BP2/P5PP/R3RQK1 b - -',I sensed the Bishop was a bit too strong so I try to get rid of it by moving his queen.
1352,38,39,2Qd8,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p1b2/2pNn3/2P5/4BP2/P5PP/R3RQK1 w - -',However this is a fantastic square to reassure Black can keep control of the long dark diagonal. I was less confident about Nxf6+ now.
1353,38,40,2f4,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p1b2/2pNn3/2P2P2/4B3/P5PP/R3RQK1 b - -',I didn't want to take the Bishop just yet because my intention was always to use the last of my pawns to pressure Black while having enough maneveur room for my King. That would have been a little more risky had I decided to let the Black Queen sit at f6 hoping for me to expose my king later.
1354,38,41,2Nxc4,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p1b2/2pN4/2n2P2/4B3/P5PP/R3RQK1 w - -',However he sets up another gambit and I don't even realize how it's a gambit right away. What is White's best move everyone?
1355,38,42,2Qxc4,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p1b2/2pN4/2Q2P2/4B3/P5PP/R3R1K1 b - -',At the time I guessed this. But I feel as though right now I should have done Nxf6+. If Nxf6 Black must do Qxf6 and now I can play Qxc4. In an actual GameKnot match I might have had a true advantage having lost two pawns for his Dark Bishop. 
1356,38,43,2Bxa1,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p4/2pN4/2Q2P2/4B3/P5PP/b3R1K1 w - -',Instead I overlooked this move and I feel as though the match is lost at this point.
1357,38,44,2Rxa1,b'1r1q1rk1/p4ppp/3p4/2pN4/2Q2P2/4B3/P5PP/R5K1 b - -',So I might as well exchange.

1360,38,47,2cxb4,b'3q1rk1/p4ppp/3p4/8/1pQ2P2/4B3/P5PP/R5K1 w - -',So they reluctantly capture the knight...
1361,38,48,2Bxa7,b'3q1rk1/B4ppp/3p4/8/1pQ2P2/8/P5PP/R5K1 b - -',and I see this move secluding the two center black pawns and possessing my Dark Bishop means that I can attack the kingside fairly easily as we're 3v2 for back pieces against the Black King. My opponent resigns here sure that I would know how to secure my win with this advantage. I was thrilled I did well although I wish both our games were better handled at the midgame! Thanks for reading this annotation!

(I'm not sure if this is the main line) then I had a good look realized that this move is not bad because it stops me from developing my dsb the queen also is now defending d4 and I can't really chase her away successfully h5 would weaken my kingside.
