0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',As normal as ever.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I reply normally - I don't play any openings - my favourite is 1. d5 for white - I rely on tactics to win the game.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Attacking the e5 pawn.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Subsequently defending.
4,0,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This; I believe is the scotch. I have no further replies than exd4.
5,0,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now I expected for my opponent to take the pawn however he did not.
6,0,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Probably attacking f7; I do not see this move as a beginner's move; rather a sensible one.
7,0,7,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',I protect my d4 pawn and develop my bishop.
8,0,8,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',c3. I am somewhat unfamiliar to the Scotch so I took innocently ...
9,0,9,dxc3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',... not knowing that I was to fall for a beginner's (?) trap.
10,0,10,Bxf7+,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/2b5/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Not taking the bishop would be awkward but taking the bishop isn't much better.
11,0,11,Kxf7,b'r1bq2nr/pppp1kpp/2n5/2b5/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',Leaving d5 a forking square.
12,0,12,Qd5+,b'r1bq2nr/pppp1kpp/2n5/2bQ4/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',This forks the unprotected bishop on c5.
13,0,13,Ke8,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/2bQ4/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Hoisting my king back to safety.
14,0,14,Qxc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/2Q5/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The bishop goes.
15,0,15,cxb2,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/2Q5/4P3/5N2/Pp3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',I take the pawn before the pawn takes me.
16,0,16,Bxb2,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/2Q5/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',The bishop takes its long laser aim at g7. Is this position in any way better for white - this disables my ability to castle but is this strictly better for white? Black is still a pawn up. Take a moment to look at this position.
17,0,17,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/2Q5/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Chasing away the queen and opening the lines for my bishop - note that Bxg7 is irrelevant as the queen is attacked.
18,0,18,1Qd5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/3Q4/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',The threat on g7 is renewed. Note that after 10. Qh5+?! g6 the queen is attacked thus the rook on h8 is safe.
19,0,19,1Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/3Q4/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Attacking the queen and preventing 11. Bxg7.
20,0,20,1Qb3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',Probably not the best square for the queen. A really passive square - moreover.
21,0,21,1Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2np4/8/4n3/1Q3N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',What with 11... Nxe4 12. Bxg7 Rg8 pins the bishop to the g2 pawn. I have used the term 'pin' here because after any move by the bishop the pawn is lost thus the queen must move to defend it.
22,0,22,1Qe3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2np4/8/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ -',This annoying pin pins the knight to the king. The knight needs to be defended.
23,0,23,1Bf5,b'r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2np4/5b2/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ -',Is this the best move - this develops the LSB; however Nh4! would be quite a killing move with the only response to be 13. ... b6 losing the rook were it not for Qxh4 - but if the knight was defended...
24,0,24,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2np4/5b2/4n3/2N1QN2/PB3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Adding the pressure and developing a piece.
25,0,25,1Qe7,b'r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2np4/5b2/4n3/2N1QN2/PB3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Is this a good move? Query to 14. Nd5 but then the Queen could just move. 
26,0,26,1Nd5,b'r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',And thus Nd5 is played - prior to the fact the queen must not leave the c7 pawn unprotected otherwise Nxc7 would fork the king and rook.
27,0,27,1Qf7,b'r3k2r/ppp2qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',This attacks the unprotected knight on d5.
28,0,28,1Rd1,b'r3k2r/ppp2qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/3RK2R b K -',Defending the knight and centralising the rook.
29,0,29,1Kd7,b'r6r/pppk1qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/4QN2/PB3PPP/3RK2R w K -',"Relieving the pin and connecting the rooks. d7 is a safe square for the king as the only attack is from the c8 - h3 diagonal defended by the f5 bishop. However this inserts a new worry - Ne5+ were it not for Nxe5 or dxe5 - but if dxe5 then Nb5++ would be disastrous. I have listed the possibility below. 

16. Ne5+ dxe5 17. Nb6++ Ke7 18. Nxa8 Rxa8 or 16. Ne5+ dxe5 17. Nf6++ Kd7 18. Nxe4 Bxe4. 19. Qxe4+ regaining material with an overall better position. However white's dreams are crushed due to the knight on c6 but if it moves ..."
30,0,30,1Qb3,b'r6r/pppk1qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/1Q3N2/PB3PPP/3RK2R b K -',This looks dangerous. What with 17. Nc6+ Ke8 18. Nxa8 wins a whole rook or Ke7 wins the exchange. The queen is not won; the king defends the queen but the exchange is won.
31,0,31,1Rhf8,b'r4r2/pppk1qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/1Q3N2/PB3PPP/3RK2R w K -',Dangerous - this looks risky; note any moves that win for white?
32,0,32,1h3,b'r4r2/pppk1qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/1Q3N1P/PB3PP1/3RK2R b K -',A quiet passive move possibly planning  g4 - next move or just creating a flight square for the king after O-O.
33,0,33,1Rae8,b'4rr2/pppk1qpp/2np4/3N1b2/4n3/1Q3N1P/PB3PP1/3RK2R w K -',Nasty discovered check 18. ... Nc5+!! coming up next move.
34,0,34,1Ne3,b'4rr2/pppk1qpp/2np4/5b2/4n3/1Q2NN1P/PB3PP1/3RK2R b K -',A rather weird way of concluding the discovered check. The queens can be swapped of after which an isolated pawn on b3 is produced. The bishop is not won after Nxf5 - Ng3+ concludes matters following Rxf5.
35,0,35,1Qxb3,b'4rr2/pppk2pp/2np4/5b2/4n3/1q2NN1P/PB3PP1/3RK2R w K -',Queen swap.
36,0,36,1axb3,b'4rr2/pppk2pp/2np4/5b2/4n3/1P2NN1P/1B3PP1/3RK2R b K -',The pawn on b3 is weak and after maybe the three pawns on the a b and c files will triumph.
37,0,37,1g5,b'4rr2/pppk3p/2np4/5bp1/4n3/1P2NN1P/1B3PP1/3RK2R w K g6',Possibly I was planning g4 next destructing the position - I cannot remember.
38,0,38,2g4,b'4rr2/pppk3p/2np4/5bp1/4n1P1/1P2NN1P/1B3P2/3RK2R b K g3',g4 as planned - but now the king cannot castle - here comes the crusher ...
39,0,39,2Bxg4,b'4rr2/pppk3p/2np4/6p1/4n1b1/1P2NN1P/1B3P2/3RK2R w K -',Bxg4 - looks like equality as after 21. hxg4 Rxf3 22. Rxh7+ white even gains a tempo but that is not the case - Observe.
40,0,40,2hxg4,b'4rr2/pppk3p/2np4/6p1/4n1P1/1P2NN2/1B3P2/3RK2R b K -',Hxg4 as follows.
41,0,41,2Rxf3,b'4r3/pppk3p/2np4/6p1/4n1P1/1P2Nr2/1B3P2/3RK2R w K -',RXN as follows - and the f2 pawn is attacked!
42,0,42,2Rxh7+,b'4r3/pppk3R/2np4/6p1/4n1P1/1P2Nr2/1B3P2/3RK3 b - -',Rxa7 as follows. 
43,0,43,2Kc8,b'2k1r3/ppp4R/2np4/6p1/4n1P1/1P2Nr2/1B3P2/3RK3 w - -',Sheltering beneath the wall of pawns and relieving the pin on the d6 pawn.
44,0,44,2Rg7,b'2k1r3/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/4n1P1/1P2Nr2/1B3P2/3RK3 b - -',This is the mistake - to big to be made. The g5 pawn is defended by the knight on e4 but the f2 pawn is attacked- that is the bigger threat.
45,0,45,2Nxf2,b'2k1r3/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2Nr2/1B3n2/3RK3 w - -',Nxf2! Crushing. White cannot cope with both Nxd1 and R8xe3/R3xe3. He will lose either the knight or the rook or both ...
46,0,46,2Ke2,b'2k1r3/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2Nr2/1B2Kn2/3R4 b - -',Oh dear. This move is wrong because ...
47,0,47,2Nxd1,b'2k1r3/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2Nr2/1B2K3/3n4 w - -',I actually made a mistake here - The best move was 24. ... Rxe3+ 25. Kd2 (25. Ke1 Nxd1+ 26. Kg2 and the bishop is free) but Nxd1 isn't that bad. If 25. Kxd1 then 25 ... Nxe3 wins a whole rook whilst after Kxf3 then 25. ... Rxe3+ and Nxb2 wins. The latter was played.
48,0,48,2Kxf3,b'2k1r3/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2NK2/1B6/3n4 b - -',The most appetising may not be the best.
49,0,49,2Rxe3+,b'2k5/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2rK2/1B6/3n4 w - -',A zwichenszug and the bishop is still hanging. The king cannot move to f2 or f4 which are the only square that can attack the rook f2 covered by the knight and the f4 square covered by the pawn. 
50,0,50,2Kg2,b'2k5/ppp3R1/2np4/6p1/6P1/1P2r3/1B4K1/3n4 b - -',The only square.

54,0,54,2Ne7,b'8/pppkn1R1/3p4/6p1/6P1/1P2r3/1n4K1/8 w - -',To blockade more checks - of course we could have Ke6 but then it comes Rg6+ and Kd8 fails to Rg8+.
55,0,55,2Rxg5,b'8/pppkn3/3p4/6R1/6P1/1P2r3/1n4K1/8 b - -',The rook snatches the pawn. No worry about the pawn but the black pieces are quite inactive. How to combine them?

270,9,0,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Anyway after I boasted and got the lucky win thereaper1 decided to challenge me to a game.  After winning easily this is where damalfi retained what happened and said that I'd never be able to win against a 1600 rated with that kind of play in my last annotation.  Guess what?  I beat someone stronger then that.  It was my coach and friend Jack Stockel who's a Class  A Player.  For example in a game against Jack I blundered very early nearly as early as the misstep against blizkov where I was down a R+2 pawns early on at the start of the midgame.  And in the end he had two passed pawns and one of those pawns nearly promoted.  This time I was nervous up until he had this way to go wrong and then got it all back.  But he made a mistake by taking another pawn and by doing so overlooked a mate in two which I was able to take advantage of.  Therefore I pulled a swindle and was able to pull a win in a hopelessly lost game.  And it's the first time in history that I was able to defeat a Class A Player after being down so much material.
271,9,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',So after his decision to make an irregular opening I'm already confident and feel that I have the advantage.  At the time I had no idea it was called the Baseman Defense but I learned what it was from id=wrecking_ball  However this is the wrong approach.  The reason is that you fianchetto the LSB immediately and bring it on the longest diagnol.  I used to view it as pointless because it's not a center pawn so it won't help control the center.  However as I also learned from WB it's not pointless because on that long diagnol the B can do a lot.  And just because someone starts off with an irregular doesn't mean anything that you have the advantage you still have to be careful with that kind of thinking because Baseman can lead to a good game from both sides and if you play against it and have a nonchalant attitude it could cost you the game.  Additionally best was 1...e6 because it's said that when you're opponent opens by advancing a pawn one square the best response is 1...e6
272,9,2,Bg2,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Yes this is the proper continuation of the Baseman.
273,9,3,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',However all I care about is developing my pieces.  But more common was 2...Nf6  While no big deal so that we don't get mixed signals I emphasize to my students facts about General Openings to set good examples.  One says that N's should be developed before your B because you know where that N goes first but have no idea where to place the bishop.
274,9,4,e3,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/8/4P1P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',?! Yes it's a developing move as it's a central pawn.  However it's pointless in my opinion because it's generally not a good idea for white to play e3 early on.  It's common when black advances the e pawn one square but shamash said that if you're white to play as white not black.
275,9,5,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/8/4P1P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Meanwhile I'll continue with development.
276,9,6,c3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/8/2P1P1P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',?! I don't know why he played this.  But this is an inaccuracy because it dosen't develop or help control the center.  In fact it makes very difficult for white to develop his N because he must now lose tempo to get it out or put that N on the rim in which it loses value.    
277,9,7,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/8/2P1P1P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQ -',Because I'm better developed and closer to controlling the center so I feel that my advantages are already growing.  Therefore I waste no time in castling because while he played I was just going to focus on what I like to do best get the K to safety.
278,9,8,b4,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/1P6/2P1P1P1/P2P1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQ b3',Worried about me playing a5.  But more important is to continue develop and get the monarch to safety.
279,9,9,Be7,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/1P6/2P1P1P1/P2P1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQ -',Also possible was 5...Bd6 or 5...Bb6  In fact that would've been a better alternative to what I played because I'm in a rather uncomfortable position with how my DSB is now placed.  But I did this because at the time I had high levels of the Fight or Flight response and was paranoid about him reattacking my piece.  Of course there's always more to chess then just an attack as I emphasize to students.  But when it comes to development I really don't care because if someone makes an undeveloping move against me I will try to exploit that weakness by attacking a piece here and there so that I immediately can get another piece out while the opponent is forced to run away.
280,9,10,Qb3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/1P6/1QP1P1P1/P2P1PBP/RNB1K1NR b KQ -',I don't know why white did this because there's no reason to break the guidelines as nothing was being threatened so this was not an exception to the guidelines.  Instead he got his Q out before developing his other pieces.
281,9,11,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/8/1P2p3/1QP1P1P1/P2P1PBP/RNB1K1NR w KQ -',So I'm already looking for a weakness that I can exploit here.  Therefore I go about pushing my pawn because I decide to deviate a little from the guidelines since I had the advantage.  Note: This is the first game ever where I thought like a GM.  Of course this happens later on but I was retaining what TA implied that I just go by my instinct and play a move and deviate from normal continuations to find a weakness that can be exploited.  Of course this move happened right after my misstep against blitzkov but right before my lucky swindle against youthanasia which I annotated.  What it means is that I was still very angry with cdeburca for making the comments he made.  So I was trying to strategize and find a game where I'd play weak moves and win.  It didn't happen from this game but that's where I figured out the perfect the one against youthanasia.  But one reason I had the wrong attitude and reason for certain was still out of anger against the kibitzers in that annotation.  So here I was still trying to show off which is why I deliberately pushed a pawn as opposed to developing another piece with 6...Nc6 the way it's supposed to be.
282,9,12,Ne2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/8/1P2p3/1QP1P1P1/P2PNPBP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Meanwhile he wastes not time in getting another piece out of his own and is getting ready to castle.
283,9,13,Ng4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/8/8/1P2p1n1/1QP1P1P1/P2PNPBP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',? Better was to develop with 7...Nc6 but like with the last move I was still very angry with cdeburca so I deliberately broke the principal of not moving the same piece more then once since that's something I got yelled at for doing.  However this was my first real mistake because it loses a pawn.  Instead that N had to stay on f6 as a defender so that white would not be able to win my e pawn.
284,9,14,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/1P2B1n1/1QP1P1P1/P2PNP1P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? But this wasn't the game where I was going to teach that commentator a lesson because at this point I decide to go back to normal development after that mistake.  And unlike what cplusplus11 said I don't completely agree that keeping material safe is more important then developing a piece which is also why I'm annotating this game.  Actually since my development and structure around that K is better instead of getting nervous which is what I used to do I'm feeling better and this confidence continues to grow.  Therefore because I believe that my opponent has a weakness I felt that I could exploit and the way to do so was continue with development as I do here.  Little did I realize that this is a developing move but the real reason I did that was development where I could bring my LSB into play.  In fact this move is a blunder because at the very least it loses a piece for a pawn.  Like my game with feisty_pawn this one also made me remember that it's generally a good idea to also take a break when you're angry.  That's because when that happens you often don't concentrate and actually make the wrong move which often turns out to be a blunder as is the case here. 
285,9,15,f3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/1P2B1n1/1QP1PPP1/P2PN2P/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Yes he is attacking my N.  But this move is pointless as that's the only reason he made this move.  In which case I can and will develop by waisting white's time so that he's in a difficult situation while I develop another piece.
286,9,16,Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/1P2B1n1/1QP1PPP1/P2PN2P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',This as noted earlier is the reason why I'll get into pieces.  That's because it's way more then just that.  By doing so he must protect it while I can do something to contest the center and get things.  Of course that attitude here is wrong as I'm about to find out.
287,9,17,1c4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/1PP1B1n1/1Q2PPP1/P2PN2P/RNB1K2R b KQ -',"This was just before I was taught to expect the best move here.  What I figured used to be one of my main weaknesses as a mentor really reviewed this thought process and now I use that information to teach chess.  I figured that with my last move he had to retreat that Q.  But you shouldn't assume that if you move here he must play that.  Instead ask what he or she can do.  And is the move good and why or why not.  Do the needed HW to actually make sure it's good.  In addition ask yourself what your opponent can do and how he or she will respond because if you just assume but then your opponent plays something that you didn't expect you'll be worse off.  That's actually what Jack means by ""Start Thinking""  He doesn't just mean to think ahead or about the game.  But also don't assume anything.  That's why my model and take on it is expect your opponent to make the best move not the worst."
288,9,18,1Nf6,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3pbn2/8/1PP1B3/1Q2PPP1/P2PN2P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',"Of course I protect my N.  But here I thought I was out of trouble.  What I didn't see however were the other threats that my opponent.  That's quite terrible because at best I'm going to lose another pawn and a R for a B with best play.  So already I'm in rough shape.  Yet I'm not giving and now I'm not angry.  Instead I was simply ignoring what cdeburca had to say in my misstep that when you're lost you resign.  It goes back to a negative experience but one thing this coach did say that I agreed with is that ""Chess is not to supposed to be a Fight or Flight mechanism"" when I told him.  However he wasn't interested in me telling him why it was and he didn't want to hear it.  And of course this was still ongoing for a very long time but then at last I got a lot of help in time of need.  I realize and it was from Jack what that weakness was.  This happened when I was down material and had a disadvantage and made mistakes and was ready to resign.  But that's when he said ""Don't get nervous.""  And then ""Don't give up right away.  Try to find a way out of trouble"" which is also a major reason as to why he's more then just a coach but also my friend as I realize that that trying to find a way out of a situation is also important in life.  That's how I was able to eliminate the Fight or Flight response because of the fact that I used to get overworried simply do to the loss of material which is why I resigned prematurely.  And this is also why I got really angry with the commentators that I mentioned earlier when they said that I should've resigned and now why I teach my students not to do this.  The very first game ever where I won a lost game was a game I annotated where I was down by more then 2 R's and a B yet still managed to pull an amazing swindle."
289,9,19,Nbd7,b'r2q1rk1/pBpnbppp/3pbn2/8/1PP5/1Q2PPP1/P2PN2P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',?? Worth noting is that I'm a much stronger player.  But here I was obsessed with developing another piece and that's the only reason I played.  Were it not for development this would've been a free R because only at the last second did I see the possibility of 12...Qxa8  In other words that was just like not strategy or tactics which chess is really supposed to be about.  Therefore it's worth noting is that there was a lot of hope chess if you go by Dan's definition as well as flip chess because at the time I was playing too many games and way too quickly.  Had about 20 simultaneous games with average time controls of about 20 minutes.  So I gave it little to no thought on most of my moves which is why I emphasize now not to play too much at once.  You don't absorb the information so you don't learn from your mistakes and you're more prone to making them.  Nonetheless despite how bad it's turned out I'm not giving up.  Instead I'm going to maintain not just hope but confidence.  But this time by thinking and planning ahead even if there's miscalculations which is more hope chess.  On the other hand this is what it's going to take to win since I am in trouble and now finding ways out of it.

So this shows that I'm already starting to come up with a plan.  This doesn't mean that I'll even attempt cheapos but I coming up with a strategy.  To note: I'm doing the WB and he has also helped me figure out the weakness and not resigning early due to his amazing Q sacs which is what also gave me an idea of boasting when anyone says that I should just resign as ""It's not so easy."""

Not only does it lose a pawn but later it'll cost him a R for my B.  And this was all planned ahead because the idea is that since I'm at a disadvantage I had to think outside the box to have another chance.  So instead of getting hesitant I'm thinking and already finding ways out of a bad situation.  And this btw is what I mean by instead of getting fretting over it that's why I get more and more confident when in a desperate situation.  It's now about being aggressive since at the time I felt that I has nothing else to lose so you might as well just do anything to stay in.  It works here but that still isn't the best approach as I recently learned.  Having said all of that best was 14.d3! to keep that pawn safe.  This is also why pawn chains are very important in addition to what I've already learned.  In fact I've kept one or two pawns safe just with a pawn chain as that's something that strengthens the pawn structures.

Note: That I had it all figured out since he castled which shows that I thought about 4 moves ahead which is already a significant improvement since at the time it was only move by move.  And now this is where I start thinking like a GM.  By this I retain I learned from both TA and GM JP.

This time the pin is going to cause damage since I will give me that opportunity to double up his pawns right in the center.  And doubled pawns in the center is the worst more so then if they were away from the center.  Now I also have way to expose his K.  Not right away but it's going to come sooner then later.

Now what I didn't realize at the time was that knowing why your opponent made the move is just as important as the reason behind your moves.  It's part of theory and also why you expect your opponent to find the right response.  It's theory based on what he or she was thinking.  But at the time I didn't know why so I felt that it didn't matter.  As far as I was considered it was an in inaccuracy since it doesn't develop so I was just going to take advantage of my opportunities with next move.  I realize now that it was about pawn structures.  The idea is connect him and go after my R so that now I must do something about it and waste time.  
297,9,27,1Nc4,b'q4rk1/p1p2ppp/3p1b2/3n4/PPnN4/4PPP1/1Q1P3P/RNB2K2 w - -',But I have plans since his pieces aren't out.  And now worth noting that my game against slongstaff I believe it was is now over after here.  So now it's about what the commentators mentioned of taking advantage of the weaknesses that you're opponent creates for him or herself which is the logic behind the General Opening Principals.

I was trying to figure how to do this right after he played 15.Qc3  The idea was doubling up his pawn right in the center like this since doubled pawns in the center are the worst even more so then doubled pawns away from the center.  In fact I've lost several games against Jack by allowing to double my pawns on the center squares and I kept that in mind by planning this out which does show that I'm an intelligent person.  That's why when I have people such as damalfi cplusplus11 or cdeburca who imply or state that I should've or deserved to lose from a mistake I made well this is how I know otherwise.  And that's also why I took offense when damalfi said that we know you'd lose against a 1600 rated player as that's false given my swindles against Jack.
300,9,30,Nxb4,b'q4rk1/p1p2ppp/3p4/8/PnnP4/5PP1/2QP3P/RNB2K2 w - -',?? Blunder.  I felt that I just compensated for all that I lost.  As far as I was considered I completely bailed out of trouble.  However I overlooked white's next move.  This was a blunder as it loses a piece which is worth more.  Best was 20...Qe4 as it puts a nasty pin right on the N.  Even when he breaks it with 21.c6 there is still a bit of pressure against black's N.  However as noted I'm still going to remain confident and not resign.
301,9,31,Qxf3+,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/3p4/8/PnQP4/5qP1/3P3P/RNB2K2 w - -',Part of my plan.  And it was a tactic that I overlooked.  However that I saw this makes builds my optimism.

However despite being ahead this loses immediately as now I have a mate in 2 which can't be avoided.  Best was 23.Qf1  Yes white loses his Q but it's the only alternative.  As after 23.Qf1 my next move would be 23...Re1 pinning that Q but I don't have a direct threat.  With this move it's mate after 23...Re1+  Once again I had to plan this out and think about it because if I didn't calculate he'd still have the advantages as I would've overlooked this mating sequence.  Now the way I calculate and occasionally think like a GM is by using the Analyze the Board feature.  That's because I figure what to do with that feature.  Games like this from past experiences are why I emphasize that my students do that so I give them HW questions that require you to use analyze the board.  
304,9,34,Qxf1#,b'6k1/p1p2ppp/3p4/8/Pn1P4/B5P1/3P3P/RN2rqK1 w - -',"So there are two morals to this game.  The first one is to develop your pieces get the K to safety and control the center as schakertje emphasizes in his 3 step process.  Note: That white pushed pawns moved the same piece more then once and brought the Q out early when the time could've been used to get his pieces into play.  More important however is to ""Fight Til the End"" as I mentioned earlier.  As you now see I had a disadvantage early on as I was down material.  But not only didn't I resign but I maintained optimism and confidence and doing so allowed me to pull this swindle.  So what I remembered were the Q sacs from TA as well as Supplemental Talking the Talk rules which is the original WTW rules that you don't resign until you see that mate is inevitable.  The idea is that you never real know and ""it's not over til it's over""  Afterall just when you think it's over your opponent might make a mistake that will allow you to make that combat and pull the swindle.  It even happens with stronger opponents.  So don't give up hope.  Instead when you're trouble calculate plan ahead and ask yourself what you can do to get out of it.  And even if you can't do anything the longer you stay in the more you learn which is one of the main things I teach in my training sessions.  Remembering these morals will help one improve his or her games.  In fact this is what I needed to do to become as good as I am today."

It depends on the position but now nothing justifys it.

347,12,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian.   I've put the game into Fritz as I've posted it here so its thoughts are noted as we go.   But of course Fritz can't really take the time to explain its rationale particularly in positional positions - which is where I'm hoping the gameknot community can come in!
348,12,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The c3 Sicilian.
349,12,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I'm more comfortable with the 2. ... Nf6 line but I'm getting used to this which is more common these days.
350,12,4,e6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pq4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',After a couple of standard book moves this is an inaccuracy I think.   Nf6 or Nc6 are the main moves.   Fritz doesn't like 4. ... e6 - but of course the question is what to do about it.
351,12,5,cxd4,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3q4/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',This also helps me giving me the c3 square for my knight.   More common is to leave the tension and try force white's knight to a3 or d2 instead.
352,12,6,Qd8,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',So for the next while the d-pawn is free to advance.   But for the next few moves I try to set up the standard IQP threats - a bishop to c4 a knight to e5 rooks into the centre the queen to d3.   It seems a bit early yet for an attack given I'm hardly developed.
353,12,7,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',So I start with this easing the threat of Nd5 blockading the pawn.
354,12,8,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Seems logical.   I need to keep a future Na5 in mind if it means taking my LSB off the a2-g8 diagonal.   For now it's not a threat though.
355,12,9,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',After 9. d5 black swaps off lots - 9. d5 ed 10. NxP NxN 11. BxN - and the position looks quite dull.   So - more pieces into the game.
356,12,10,1Re1,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',A good square for the rook.   e7 can be a focal point for tactics later if I can get in Ne5 and Nxf7.   But that's a long way away; for now I think this is just the best square for the rook.
357,12,11,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',Logical
358,12,12,1a3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - -',Now I wanted to keep my bishop on the current diagonal so this was played against Na5.   But maybe this is over cautious?   Fritz gives it as a very slight inaccuracy giving 11. Bf4 as about 0.2 better.
359,12,13,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP1B2/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',Fritz's number one pick with the threat of Nb5 to be considered.
360,12,14,1a6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BP1B2/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - -',So he defends against it
361,12,15,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BP1B2/P1NQ1N2/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Fritz prefers Rc1 or the d5 break here but not by much.   I hadn't yet considered d5 as after 13. ... ed 14. NxP NxN 15. BxN I didn't see what I had.   But Fritz says black has nothing better then than 15. ... Be6 allowing 16. BxN PxB when black has some pawn weaknesses.   I would have thought the d5 push should achieve more than this though?
362,12,16,1Rad1,b'2rq1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BP1B2/P1NQ1N2/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Both rooks are now optimally placed but the d5 break is becoming more favoured - white seems to have an initiative advantage.   I didn't like how much freer black's position - particularly the bishops - becomes though.
363,12,17,1Ba2,b'2rq1rk1/3bbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/P1NQ1N2/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',The bishop can hop between a2 and b1 as needs be.
364,12,18,1Ne5,b'2rq1rk1/3bbppp/p3pn2/np2N3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Stopping the knight coming into c4 and taking advantage of e5 now being available.   But again Fritz calls for 16. d5 - yet as it plays through the analysis it becomes less enamoured with the move.   So is it time for the move yet?   There don't seem to be any material-winning tactics as yet.
365,12,19,1Nc6,b'2rq1rk1/3bbppp/p1n1pn2/1p2N3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',A bit of a concession
366,12,20,1Bb1,b'2rq1rk1/3bbppp/p1n1pn2/1p2N3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/1P3PPP/1B1RR1K1 b - -',The knight is immune from capture (17. ... NxN?? 18. PxN and black can't save the knight on f6 and prevent mate on h7) and I'm aiming to force a weakness on the kingside.
367,12,21,1g6,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p1n1pnp1/1p2N3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/1P3PPP/1B1RR1K1 w - -',There we go.    It's something at least.   Maybe at a future stage a h4-h5 push could help crack black open some more.   Obviously the knight on f6 would need to be addressed.  I had a vague idea of a plan along the lines of h4 Re3 Rh3 h5 and saccing the exchange to open the king.   I don't know how effective that would have been though.   And it doesn't fit in with my next move.
368,12,22,1Ba2,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p1n1pnp1/1p2N3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',I've played reasonably well so far (says Fritz) but this throws away all my advantage.   I wanted to bring the bishop back to the same diagonal as the king as the g6 move seemed to have blunted its scope too much on b1.   But I've missed 18. ... b4 19. ab NxB and my LSB is taken off the board.   So instead Fritz wants to bring more pieces towards the king - Bh6 or Qf3.   Though I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated at the lack of decisive action; maybe I just need more patience!
369,12,23,1Nxe5,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p3pnp1/1p2n3/3P1B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',My opponent misses his chance and I have a big advantage now.   This move is a shame - it seems that black has thrown away the game.   So I'm trying to go back over my previous moves to see where I could have improved.   If the play was ok (as Fritz thinks it roughly is 18. Bb2 aside) what were my routes to victory?
370,12,24,1dxe5,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p3pnp1/1p2P3/5B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',The f6 knight now must get kicked to an awkward square - and it also needs to protect the d7 bishop.
371,12,25,1Nd5,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p3p1p1/1p1nP3/5B2/P1NQ4/BP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',I was a bit surprised at this move - it came quickly and I hadn't really analysed PxN fully; it had to be good - but Fritz gives it as the best though it drops a pawn.
372,12,26,2Bxd5,b'2rq1rk1/3bbp1p/p5p1/1p1BP3/5B2/P2Q4/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',Pawn in the bag.   But now what?

376,12,30,2fxe6,b'2rqr1k1/4b2p/p3p1pB/1p2P3/8/P2Q4/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',So this is forced
377,12,31,2Qh3,b'2rqr1k1/4b2p/p3p1pB/1p2P3/8/P6Q/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',And I hit the weak pawn.   I was unsure between this and 24. Qb3; I figured on this one as it was closer the king.   Fritz slightly prefers 24. Qb3 I guess to help cover a future intrusion on c2.
378,12,32,2Qb6,b'2r1r1k1/4b2p/pq2p1pB/1p2P3/8/P6Q/1P3PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Forced to cover the pawn (and save the queen of course).

After putting the game through Fritz it seems I played better than I thought (18. Ba2 aside) - but it didn't seem to me like many of the standard IQP plans really came into play.   Happy to hear suggestions from others on how to improve my play!   The IQP is common in the c3 Sicilian and other lines I play (like the Panov-Botvinnik against the Caro-Kann) - I could always do with improvement!
384,13,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',A move I would not play as black since the c pawn's mobility is very important IMO. But it's a matter of taste. Black has to be aware he will have to solve lsb's developement.

But fxB would have opened the f file for his rook so it was not really so good. These are the well-known ups and down of this scheme. 
389,13,5,c3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3bpn2/2ppN3/3P4/2P1P2P/PP1N1PPB/R2QKB1R b KQ -',Not really forced but black's countergame on the black squares can easily become dangerous.

I'm aware the whole line is not really good for white but black is not doing the more aggressive moves. Black should aim to play f6 kicking my N but it implies moves like Ne4 (NxN dxN) etc. In playing this I'm aware I'm blinding my dsb and I will have to take care of it later. 
392,13,8,1Nf5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/3pNn2/2pP1P2/2P1P2P/PP1N2PB/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Threatening e3.

This position is good for me also because it kind of pins the e6 pawn (my saying is ""developement for developement's sake is ok but not good"". In this case the B goes to a good square not to - say - e2. It must be said that this same bishop on g2 was very well placed too but 1) I will castle queenside so Bxb7 was not a good threat for me to make and 2) hey this is aiming where the BK is! You wont't prefer the other side of the board as a target! :-). Of course since I am a bad player (specially on blitz!) I didn't see next black's move. "

This was the tricky way I found to cope with the BxRa1 threat but of course it was not necessary and better would have been to play Rh-e1 at once.

424,13,40,3Kd2,b'4b1k1/Bp4pp/8/3p1p2/5PP1/2P4P/PP1K4/8 b - -',...trying to reinforce my positional advantage. But in doing so I know I'm sacrifying a pawn - in the long term.

426,13,42,3f5,b'6k1/Bp1b2pp/8/3p1P2/6P1/2P5/PP1K4/8 b - -',Probably bad but if I force him to play Bc6 his B will be kind of neutralyzed. 
427,13,43,h5,b'8/Bp1b1kp1/8/3p1P1p/6P1/2P1K3/PP6/8 w - h6',Nice I should have seen it. I can play Kf to retake with it but then g6 and I lose a pawn for nothing. 
428,13,44,Bxf5,b'8/Bp3kp1/8/3p1b1P/8/2P1K3/PP6/8 w - -',Ok. No problem. I'm still +1 and his g pawns promotes on dark square (g1). I have to be very careful not to leave the big diag. 
429,13,45,Bg4,b'8/Bp4p1/4k3/2Kp3P/6b1/2P5/PP6/8 w - -',It will be an exchange then...
430,13,46,3Bd4,b'8/1K4p1/4k3/3p4/3B4/2P2b2/PP6/8 b - -',...preventing the discovered check (I could have moved the K too but I didn't like Kc7 or Kb6 - again).
431,13,47,3g5,b'8/1K6/4k3/3p2p1/3B4/2P2b2/PP6/8 w - g6',As long as my B is there there will be no prob. 
432,13,48,4a4,b'8/1K6/4k3/3p2p1/P2B4/2P2b2/1P6/8 b - a3',Race on. How can black save it?
433,13,49,Be2,b'8/1K6/3k4/P2p2p1/3B4/2P5/1P2b3/8 w - -',Black will have to lose the bishop for sure but will it be enough to win? Sure. 
434,13,50,Bb5,b'8/1K6/P2k4/1b1p2p1/3B4/2P5/1P6/8 w - -',Black will take my queen making my king go to a8. 
435,13,51,g4,b'8/PK6/3k4/1b1p4/3B2p1/2P5/1P6/8 w - -',Now black wanted to fool me... well I'll fool him:

437,13,53,4b3,b'8/K7/8/2kpB3/6p1/1PP5/8/8 b - -',A simple move like that is full of sadism...
438,13,54,5Ka6,b'8/8/K1k5/3pB3/6p1/1PP5/8/8 b - -',It's a matter of time. 
439,14,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Usual move - urges for the control of the centre.

However after the recapture there will be an open b-file for either of us to use but there is no reason why I cannot place a rook on the b-file first. Also from a book - grab an open file as quickly as you can.

459,14,20,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/p1q1bppp/2ppbn2/4p3/2P1P3/2N1BN2/P1P1QPPP/1R1R2K1 w - -',Ignoring the b-file I defend the d6 pawn.
460,14,21,1c5,b'3r1rk1/p1q1bppp/2ppbn2/2P1p3/4P3/2N1BN2/P1P1QPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',15. c5? Even though I thought of it why play this move? It breaks the d-file but gives away the pawn: even 15. ... dxc5 16. Rxd8 Rxd8 bring no harm.
461,14,22,1Qa5,b'3r1rk1/p3bppp/2ppbn2/q1P1p3/4P3/2N1BN2/P1P1QPPP/1R1R2K1 w - -',But I have other plans eyeing the c-pawn and the loose knight on c3.

468,14,29,1cxd3,b'5rk1/p3bppp/2p1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/2qPBN2/P3QPPP/1R4K1 b - -',The pawn recaptures; now all is looking a bit better for white despite the fact that he is a knight and a pawn down; all his pawns are strong save the a2 pawn which is defended now by the queen on e2. His bishop is in an active position and his rook controls the b-file perhaps eyeing to come to b7! What could be better. Flip the position and see yourself as white compared to black who has three groups of isolated pawns and all his pieces save queen on inactive squares. Yes maybe I am a knight up but positionally?
469,14,30,1Rd8,b'3r2k1/p3bppp/2p1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/2qPBN2/P3QPPP/1R4K1 w - -',However everything changes here. I develop my rook onto an active square attacking the strong d-pawn.
470,14,31,2Rb7,b'3r2k1/pR2bppp/2p1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/2qPBN2/P3QPPP/6K1 b - -',Cleverly thought of. The rook sweeps out onto b7: if Bd6 this blocks my attack on the d3 pawn and Bf8 gives a bad bishop.
471,14,32,2Bd6,b'3r2k1/pR3ppp/2pbbn2/2p1p3/4P3/2qPBN2/P3QPPP/6K1 w - -',But Bd6 is better and it gives the bishop a better square.
472,14,33,2Ne1,b'3r2k1/pR3ppp/2pbbn2/2p1p3/4P3/2qPB3/P3QPPP/4N1K1 b - -',Ne1? This move messes up White's 'what was a lovely position'. The d3 pawn is just about defended and the knight looks ugly on e1. If a rook comes down to the back rank and pins the knight disaster shall happen.
473,14,34,2c4,b'3r2k1/pR3ppp/2pbbn2/4p3/2p1P3/2qPB3/P3QPPP/4N1K1 w - -',A great sound move in an attempt to get rid of the d3 pawn and my doubled c-pawn. 
474,14,35,2Bxa7,b'3r2k1/BR3ppp/2pbbn2/4p3/2p1P3/2qP4/P3QPPP/4N1K1 b - -',Again this ruins the position even more. Now the white pieces are in chunks; queen and knight on the back rank doing nothing and rook and bishop on the seventh rank doing nothing: Not a pawn for a pawn - though this does leave the e4 pawn protect after the pawns are exchanged.
475,14,36,2cxd3,b'3r2k1/BR3ppp/2pbbn2/4p3/4P3/2qp4/P3QPPP/4N1K1 w - -',I exchange.
476,14,37,2Nxd3,b'3r2k1/BR3ppp/2pbbn2/4p3/4P3/2qN4/P3QPPP/6K1 b - -',23. Nxd3? Actually though it may seem like a good move what is best is Qxd3; exchanging queens and then Nxd3 after the queen swap - this loses a knight to Bc4.
477,14,38,2Bc4,b'3r2k1/BR3ppp/2pb1n2/4p3/2b1P3/2qN4/P3QPPP/6K1 w - -',The knight cannot be defended and is lost.

479,14,40,2Bxd3,b'3r2k1/1R3ppp/1Bpb1n2/4p3/4P3/2qb4/P3QPPP/6K1 w - -',I take the knight and threaten the queen ignoring the free rook on d8 providing that there is no check available. This also threatens Qc1+ where mate would soon follow.
480,14,41,2Qd1,b'3r2k1/1R3ppp/1Bpb1n2/4p3/4P3/2qb4/P4PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',The only square in which to defend mate.

482,14,43,2Ra7,b'4r1k1/R4ppp/1Bpb1n2/4p3/4P3/2qb4/P4PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',?? I can see into his mind - he intends to play Ra5 and perhaps get his rook into the 'game' - but this loses a bishop.
483,14,44,2Rb8,b'1r4k1/R4ppp/1Bpb1n2/4p3/4P3/2qb4/P4PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',And the bishop cannot move since 27. ... Rb1! pins the queen. If of course Bd3? then comes Rb1 28. Bc1 Rxc1 and all is looking grim for white.
484,14,45,2Ba5,b'1r4k1/R4ppp/2pb1n2/B3p3/4P3/2qb4/P4PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',Nice try attacking my queen.
485,14,46,2Qd4,b'1r4k1/R4ppp/2pb1n2/B3p3/3qP3/3b4/P4PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',I am attacking his rook but his queen is more important. Of course white can wriggle - after my queen has moved it is no longer covering the c1 square and so ...
486,14,47,2Bd2,b'1r4k1/R4ppp/2pb1n2/4p3/3qP3/3b4/P2B1PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',Bd2 ...

489,14,50,2Nxe4,b'6k1/R4ppp/2pb4/4p3/3qn3/3b4/P4PPP/1rBQ2K1 w - -',Threatening Qxf2+ - of course I could have taken the rook but the pressure is on for him anyway so I decided to increase the pressure. I don't like being greedy. 
490,14,51,3Qe1,b'6k1/R4ppp/2pb4/4p3/3qn3/3b4/P4PPP/1rB1Q1K1 b - -',No doubt defending the f2 square but that doesn't work.
491,14,52,3Nxf2,b'6k1/R4ppp/2pb4/4p3/3q4/3b4/P4nPP/1rB1Q1K1 w - -',And the queen cannot take back since Rxc1 is mate! The rook is still hanging.

499,14,60,3Be2,b'6k1/q4ppp/2pb4/8/4p3/7n/P3b1P1/1rB1Q2K w - -',"!!! What! That's two pieces hanging! Surely not. Surely not. But yes this is a fabulous move. Take a moment to admire this move. Here are the variations - there is no good move for white to make.

1. 35. Qxe2 Qg1#
2. 35. gxh3 Bf3#

I hope you spotted the first variation but did you see the second? Now what could white possibly do? He can't take so ..."

The question is Be2 hasn't got anywhere - it may have been a spectacular move but has it got us anywhere? No? So what could white possibly do now - a3 actually has a good use - it stops Bb3 ... that's a clue - what's coming next ...
501,14,62,3Bg3,b'6k1/q4ppp/2p5/8/4p3/P5bn/4b1P1/1rB1Q2K w - -',Whoop whoop! Actually this move is dead easy to spot but it's a killer - the white queen is trapped. [Keep in mind that 36. gxh3 Bf3# is still mate] - this leaves white as stranded as ever - and of course any move with the bishop leaves the obvious 37. ... Rxe1#. (Unless of course 36. Be3 Rxe1+ 37. Bg1 Rxg1# but fussy people that doesn't matter). So what is white to do.
502,14,63,3a4,b'6k1/q4ppp/2p5/8/P3p3/6bn/4b1P1/1rB1Q2K b - -',This is the best move - leaving the queen to be taken. Obviously with QXB comes Qg1# but this slows it down a bit. Anyhow continuing...

588,16,33,2bxc5,b'r2q4/p3k1r1/Ppn1b3/2P1p2Q/3pNp2/2PB4/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',And now white has compensation for lost material proof that one move like 8.Nxf7 doesn't make a difference.
589,16,34,2Qh4+,b'r2q4/p3k1r1/Ppn1b3/2P1p3/4Np1Q/2pB4/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Idea: the skewer which gets the Q's off and will force a draw in this position.
590,16,35,2cxb6,b'3r4/p2k2r1/PPn1b3/4p3/4Np2/2pB4/5PP1/R4RK1 b - -',And now white has full compensation because if 27...bxa6?? black's forced to lose a N in order to protect the R since that pawn would immediately promote after 28.a7  Once again this proves that white's eighth move did not cause any damage.  Meaning: it did not affect him at all.
591,16,36,2Ke7,b'3r4/p3k1r1/PPn1b3/4p3/4Np2/2pB4/5PP1/R4RK1 w - -',So this is his next move.
592,16,37,2Rad1,b'3r4/n3k1r1/P3b3/4p3/4Np2/2pB4/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',I would've played 29.Rac1 for that pawn.  Though black could then answer with 29...Rc8 no matter how you slice it.
593,16,38,2Bh3,b'3r4/n3k1r1/P7/4p3/4Np2/2pB3b/5PP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Going for mate which is difficult to drive off.
594,16,39,3Ng3,b'3r4/n3k1r1/P7/4p3/5p2/2pB2Nb/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',But white however has ways out of it.
595,16,40,Nc6,b'3r4/4k1r1/P1n5/4p3/8/2pB2pP/5P2/3R1RK1 w - -',I don't know why black played this.  
596,16,41,3Be4,b'3r4/4k1r1/P1n5/4p3/4B3/2p3pP/5P2/3R1RK1 b - -',To cover a lot say 15 squares.  The more squares the B covers the better shape you're in as I learned from easy19.
597,16,42,3g2,b'3r4/4k1r1/P1n5/4p3/4B3/2p4P/5Pp1/3R1RK1 w - -',A passed pawn that this time isn't dangerous.
598,16,43,3Rfe1,b'3r4/4k1r1/P1n5/4p3/4B3/2p4P/5Pp1/3RR1K1 b - -',Because of this and with the K there the pawn can't do damage.  I know because this is another position that Jack has also made me study as HW.  It was only with one or two positions with that pawn in front of a K and asking what kind of damage it could do and the answer is no.  In fact this is more often then not how a stalemate occurs.  However I would've taken that pawn 33.Bxg2 but white has other ideas.
599,16,44,Nd4,b'8/4k1r1/P7/4p3/3nB3/2p4P/5Pp1/3R2K1 w - -',Well black has to do something since the N is en-prise.
600,16,45,3a7,b'8/P3k1r1/8/4p3/3nB3/2p4P/5Pp1/3R2K1 b - -',At last white has a pawn that is going to promote.
601,16,46,3c2,b'8/P3k1r1/8/4p3/3nB3/7P/2p2Pp1/3R2K1 w - -',But so does black.
602,16,47,3Ra1,b'8/P3k1r1/8/4p3/3nB3/7P/2p2Pp1/R5K1 b - -',The obvious move protecting the R and ascertaining the promotion since the R is directly behind his pawn.  Meaning: That they're on the same file.  And there's nothing black can do since his R is not on a8.
603,16,48,3Ne2+,b'8/P3k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/2p1nPp1/R5K1 w - -',I idea is a free promotion since without a N on e2 black would not be able to promote.  In fact it would then be a win for white but this move guarantees a draw.
604,16,49,g1=Q+,b'8/P3k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/2p1nP1K/R5q1 w - -',And now black Q's with no way out of it.
605,16,50,3a8=Q,b'Q7/4k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/2p2P1K/6n1 b - -',But so does white.
606,16,51,3c1=Q,b'Q7/4k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/5P1K/2q3n1 w - -',Same thing could be said here except black's ahead.  But like before it's not going to make a difference.
607,16,52,4Qa7+,b'8/Q3k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/5P1K/2q3n1 b - -',And now it is a draw by repetition.  
608,16,53,4Qa7+,b'8/Q3k1r1/8/4p3/4B3/7P/5P1K/2q3n1 b - -',As we can see white gave up a piece but it did not cost him the game even in a position like this.  And up against a stronger player unlike what cplusplus11 outlined.  So the moral is that there's always more to a story then meets the eye so don't judge a book by it's cover.
609,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Well there was a little real chess but most of it was hope chess as I did not calculate.  But that is how I won to stand up for myself against Dave lol.  So I open with the typical.  One thing worth noting btw is that it was a training game because I was trying to train him.  Now I asked him which color he wanted to be and he wanted to be black. 
610,17,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So my opponent decides on the French Defense.
611,17,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Of course I'm used to playing against it.
612,17,3,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now as I told him this is a fianchetto because he's forming a flank for that B since it is prepared to go on a long diagnol.  By that I allude to b7 or a6 pointing right in that direction which is why it's said to be on the flank.  But as I noted better was to develop with that d pawn since it's right on the center squares needed to control the center though it's slightly.  However even better then that was to develop right away by bringing that DSB or g N into play.  Between the two candidate moves I'd say that best was 2...Nf6 because you know where the N go but don't where to place that B.
613,17,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I go right for it with this move.  Of course it involves the usual goal to castle early.
614,17,5,Bb7,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So he develops and goes for my e pawn.
615,17,6,Bd3,b'rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Also possible was 4.Qe2 but I won't do that.  I always emphasize to my students to develop your pieces get the K to safety and control the center.  And bringing the Q out early won't help.  So to set a good example I don't.  I could've also played 4.Nbd2 but it's kind of crammed and in an uncomfortable.  Plus it would make it difficult for my DSB to come out.  So I played this with the idea of course to castle.  Worth noting that right now we're in the process of a little hope combined with real chess.  The part where I didn't want to cram my N or set a bad example was real chess.  But there was hope since the plan is to castle soon and I'm not even calculating to reach that moment.
616,17,7,Bb4+,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Of course this delays my ability to castle but not for long.  
617,17,8,Bd2,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Well there was a plan behind this move but it didn't require me to think.  The idea is getting out of check by developing another piece.  Plus the idea is a strong B pair which you do by having your B's aligned not always but usually vertical to one another in the center.  This blends in with center control.  
618,17,9,O-O,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p1bp3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',This was the plan behind 5.Bd2  But more to it then meets the eye.  The idea is that I went after his B forcing him to waste a move by moving it again while I got to use that time to get my K to safety.  While everything is even with my last move I already feel that I have an advantage.  But I'm not getting overlyconfident as I just know how to keep my advantage this time.
619,17,10,Nf6,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p1bpn2/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',?? I understand why he played.  The idea was to continue with development and castled K side.  But he could've developed.  But what I pointed out however is also true.  In it I said This is an exception to the guideline. While developing your pieces is important more important is keeping your material safe. And this move allows a fork where I attack two pieces with one and win something in return.  In this case a piece for a pawn.  All of this was based on hope chess btw.  
620,17,11,e5,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p1bpn2/4P3/3P4/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',So it starts with this move.
621,17,12,Ng4,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p1bp3/4P3/3P2n1/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',In this case I feel he made the right choice.  Generally speaking a B is worth more then a N.  But in this position the N is worth more because black can do more with his N then the B.  That's because the B has limited squares whereas the N is more mobile.
622,17,13,exd6,b'rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p1Pp3/8/3P2n1/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',As noted I take.
623,17,14,cxd6,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p1pp3/8/3P2n1/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',He takes back but the idea is that he lost a piece for a pawn.  And he has doubled pawns right in the center which is generally the worse place for them even worse then doubled pawns away from that area. With that black's advantages are growing especially when you also count the fact that black has another piece to develop and needs to tuck his monarch away.
624,17,15,Bb4,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p1pp3/8/1B1P2n1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Seeing that I have the advantage I get right to it by going after his d pawn.  However there's more to it because if it was just to win that pawn I wouldn't play it.  The other idea is that N isn't crammed when I develop my last piece.  
625,17,16,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2p3/3p4/1B1P2n1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',As I expected he defends his pawn.  Of course he also could've defended with 9...Qc7  What it implies is that he had other ways to defend it so what I'm saying is that no matter how did it my next move would be no matter how you slice it 10.Nc3
626,17,17,1Nc3,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2p3/3p4/1B1P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',As I know 10.Nd2 was also an option but it looks kind of awkward because that N would be crammed.  Additionally if 10.Nd2 I can't put on Ne4 or Nc4 because of that pawn so then real chess would be needed.  However my idea is still hope chess so I played this.  That way there would be nothing to calculate.
627,17,18,1Nc6,b'r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1pn1p3/3p4/1B1P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Of course he doesn't waste time to develop another.  Plus he goes right after my B.
628,17,19,1Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1pnBp3/3p4/3P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Seeing all of it this is my response.  The reason being is that I know that this move puts pressure right in the center as I'm attacking the center square making it more difficult to control the center.  The idea is exploiting his weakness since I've already castled and have that contested the center.  I put pressure on it by making it impossible for him to castle K side because if he does so I win a R for my B.  Like before I didn't have to think about it.  
629,17,20,1Nb4,b'r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p1Bp3/3p4/1n1P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?? Don't know why he played this but it's another blunder as it loses a piece with my next move.
630,17,21,1Bxb4,b'r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2p3/3p4/1B1P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Once again I did not have to think about this.  And from this point on I knew that I could easily win by doing what I've been doing hope chess.
631,17,22,1a5,b'r2qk2r/1b1p1ppp/1p2p3/p2p4/1B1P2n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq a6',To go for my B.
632,17,23,1Ba3,b'r2qk2r/1b1p1ppp/1p2p3/p2p4/3P2n1/B1NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',But I remembered by heard this is how most GM's responds.  Now I also could've played 13.Bd6 but this doesn't make a difference as he still can't castle without losing his R.
633,17,24,1h5,b'r2qk2r/1b1p1pp1/1p2p3/p2p3p/3P2n1/B1NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq h6',To keep his N in case I moved f N. 
634,17,25,1Nb5,b'r2qk2r/1b1p1pp1/1p2p3/pN1p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',But I don't do it right away as I have other ideas.  BTW this was the one of few times time where everything was Real Chess but this is not going to last long.  That's because I have a plan here which is going to be difficult for black to do anything about.  And the plan isn't to win anything else right now but something even worse seeing black's weakness.
635,17,26,1Bc6,b'r2qk2r/3p1pp1/1pb1p3/pN1p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Ok.  It protects the B but as noted that's not what I had in mind.
636,17,27,1Nd6+,b'r2qk2r/3p1pp1/1pbNp3/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',However 14.Nb5 this was my last move.  And the reason being is that now that I checked him with my N he loses castling rights.  Since I developed my pieces castled and controlled the center not being able to castle is going to add insult to injury for black.  But now that it's easy I go completely back to for a long while.  There will not be anymore Real Chess until we're near the end.  And the next time move that involves real chess will also have hope chess.  In other words this is the only time where there isn't any hope chess.
637,17,28,1Ke7,b'r2q3r/3pkpp1/1pbNp3/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? Blunder.  First this exposes his K.  But mainly it loses his Q with my next move due to the discover.  Instead 15...Qe7 was best.
638,17,29,1Nb7+,b'r2q3r/1N1pkpp1/1pb1p3/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',BTW I very nearly overlooked this move.  Instead I was thinking about where to put the N in order to prevent black from getting back a piece.  The only way then would've 16.Nb5 which is the move I almost played.  But at the very last moment only a few seconds did I see this opportunity.
639,17,30,1Kf6,b'r2q3r/1N1p1pp1/1pb1pk2/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',The only other move was 16...Kf8
640,17,31,1Nxd8,b'r2N3r/3p1pp1/1pb1pk2/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',But even if he had played this is how I would've his Q for my N.
641,17,32,1Qd2,b'3r3r/3p1pp1/1pb1pk2/p2p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The real reason behind this move was to get my remaining piece out and connect the R's.  However I also could've done that with 18.Qe2 so why didn't I play that?  Well this is where I mix hope with real chess.  So it's no coincidence.  With this move there is a mate threat.  And I analyzed if it was easy to drive off or not.  For if it were then I would've answered with 18.Qe2  However by analyzing I realized that mate is impossible to drive off now because of my N and the fact that his K is pinned and can't move so mate cannot avoided because in order to do so he'd have to move it.  I actually saw an example and a GM won by doing this.  And I applied the same thing in another game that by pinning the K like that you have an easy mate.  Additionally this is how I realized that archduke_piccolo and andywm would mate in one which was why resigned.  The only way to hold off mate for one move is would be 18...e5 in which case I'd mate almost right after as then 19.Qg5+ Ke6 (forced) 20.Qf5#  So waisting no time I get right into it and played this.  In addition I didn't have to calculate this mate despite analyzing and studying the position.
642,17,33,1b5,b'3r3r/3p1pp1/2b1pk2/pp1p3p/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',But with this move I mate immediately.  The only option was 18...e5 because of what I noted above.
643,17,34,1Qg5#,b'3r3r/3p1pp1/2b1pk2/pp1p2Qp/3P2n1/B2B1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And there you have it.  One lesson though is that it's important to complete development get the K to safety and control the center.  But there are exceptions to that guideline and sometimes you have to ignore them to avoid losing material.  Even more important however is that studying things are important.  Sometimes however it is better to just know the best moves and not calculate.  And as Dave puts it this is hope chess.  My point is that hope chess is the way to go.  So @Dave: When you look at this game based on why moves were played we can conclude that there was far more hope chess then my game against geniusacamel and that is how and why I played so well.  Afterall this game involved more then hope chess as I didn't attempt the calculations and look at the result.  As you see it was in my favor this time.

694,20,2,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',A more aggressive response is e4 making a more strategic push for the center but this move open up the bishop going after the c4 pawn for early equalization.

697,20,5,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2BP2b1/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Early aggressive.  Unless you want to castle queenside I would focus on less aggressive development.  I think e6 is a good response.  It blunts any light squared bishop attacks and allow the black squared bishop a path to development.

look a little deeper and one can see that the white Queen has the possibility of been placed on d3 or c2 when the c2 pawn moves afforded as such by the pawn cover given by the pawns on d4 and e4.

let's take stock here WHITE has open lines for it's 2 bishops both knights are developed and a half open D file.
BLACK has the half open C file a knight developed and open lines for it's bishop on c8 and queen on d8.

If black had not played 5...a6 then white had the possibility of a check on b5 developing a piece with attack gaining a tempo resulting in forcing black to respond to the check! by white achieving that goal

1074,32,7,1Nxc7+,b'r1b1k2r/ppN4p/2n2p2/2b1p1p1/8/2PP1N1q/PP2KP2/R2Q2R1 b kq -',:)  The knight ends up trapped but still a decent trade.
1075,32,8,gxf3+,b'N1bk3r/pp5p/2n2p2/2b1p3/8/2PP1pRq/PP2KP2/R2Q4 w - -',White is in trouble.  KxPf3 means Bg4+ pins the king against the queen.  RxBg4 is not possible because of discovered check by the black queen.  So black ends up with the white queen for a bishop.
1076,32,9,2Kxf3,b'N1bk3r/pp5p/2n2p2/2b1p3/8/2PP1KRq/PP3P2/R2Q4 b - -',No!  No no!  Oh the humanity!

1078,32,11,Bb6,b'N1k4r/pp5p/1bn2p2/4pb2/1P6/2PP2R1/P4PK1/3R4 w - -',Nicely done.  The bishop is driven back where black can trade it for the trapped knight.
1079,32,12,2d4,b'N1k4r/pp5p/1bn2p2/4pb2/1P1P4/2P3R1/P4PK1/3R4 b - -',NxBb6 was probably better. Black has a lot of power on Pd4.  PxPd4 PxPd4 BxPd4 and the knight is still protecting the bishop while the white knight is about to feed the black king.

1088,33,8,c2,b'2k1r3/pp6/2pRb2p/8/5R1P/8/P1p3P1/7K w - -',Queening is already unavoidable.

Nd2 looks a little better preparing for f3 in my own time.  

dxe5 doesn't look too bad.  I get to keep a solid pawn formation and a strong point for one of my knights on d4.  However Emma would get to play c5 in short order chasing away my brilliant knight and then b6 opening up the killing diagonal a8/h1 for her white squared bishop (WSB) onto my castled King if I castle Kingside....not liking that!

How about Ne2?..then probably after retreating my Bishop to c2 following blacks e4 push I could play Ng3Nd20-0 and f3....Looks like a plan!     mmmmm. hang on..she can play Bg4 which ties me up a bit and then it's difficult to untangle myself.  

I might have to play h3 first...Bit slow and against opening principles.  Should be developing pieces asap.

OK...going back to Nd2.  Of course if she takes on d4 I shall retake with the e pawn and I will be very comfy....but she will almost certainly push e4 but I always have f3 later to diffuse things in that area and at least I will have 2 pieces developed if I play it in this order....yep...I think I will play Nd2."
