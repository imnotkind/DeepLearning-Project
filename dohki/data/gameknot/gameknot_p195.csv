This Knight is really thinking about removing the few defenders that yet remain around the Black King - HIS PAWNS.  I am saying to the pawn - WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF MY KNIGHTS?  IT IS FREE - I DARE YOU TO TAKE IT!

I can do this because Sigmund has the following problems with his army:
1.) His pieces have less space
2.) He is playing a Rook down - the one on a8 is not doing anything.
3.) His Knights are passively looking at each other - how vain!

I.) Capture the piece
II.) Block the check (Not an option against Knights.)
III.) Runaway.
So here is a list of possible moves that I could play in this position:
1.) 20. Qxf2
2.) 20. Kf1
3.) 20. Kh1
So I have three options.  Let us look at the first of these... 

1.) What is wrong with the line 20. Qxf2 Qxf2 + 21. Kxf2 Bb3! And now I am losing the pawn on a4 and the endgame - OR - I am ""just"" losing the exchange - My Rook (5 points) for his Bishop (3 points).  I also no longer have an attack - or my Queen with which to attack with.  SO I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THIS OPTION - Thank you very much!
2.) 20. Kf1 brings my King towards the center of the board where it will be easier for my opponent to attack him.  I only want to centralize my King in the endgame when there are fewer pieces and pawns standing upon the board - we are in a heavily populated middle-game position right now and the middle of the board is the last place that my King wants to be.  I would also be standing on the square that one of my Rooks might like to stand upon - the f3-square.  WAIT A MINUTE!
3.) 20. Kh1 Gets my King out of Check allows him to find some measure of safety and gives my d1 Rook the f1 square.  Once my Rook gets to that square it will be able to attack down the semi-open f-file.  BRILLIANT - I like that plan!"

If you both look at whatever important square that you are both ""arguing about"" - and here it was the f2 square with the Black Bishop upon it - the same number of times then who-ever steps upon it first will lose a piece or pawn.  If one of you looks at the important square more than your opponent - then you can own that square - maybe even step on it.
In this game I added a second attacker to the f2 square - my Rook - and so I was now looking at that square twice.  Sigmund was only looking at the f2 square once - with his Queen.  We never count the pieces or pawns that stand upon such important squares as these pieces and pawns never look at their own feet.  So in this game I got to own the f2 square which - once the Bishop was saved by being yanked away by it's Queen - gave me the f-file down which to attack with my Rooks. "

Your intuitive grasp of good opening moves is impressive.

Incidentally this is the Slav Variation (the precise one that he erroneously thought that he was playing against me).

The slav is solid and fine for black and your instincts about how to develop your pieces in this opening are good - though once I start pressuring you had a hard time finding the optimal responses."

Even at my level I make this mistake - can't think of what to do so I attack a piece and it just gets to somewhere better than where it was.

Taking my b pawn with your rook should have been a strong candidate for your move.   Every time its your move you should see if you can take one of my pieces without my having recourse.  The b2 pawn is unguarded so you could have captured it.  however I would have then played Bb3 and your rook is stuck on the 2nd rank.  It probably won't get captured but it will be cramped.  So I don't really know if the capture was a good idea or not.  Maybe maybe not.  Point is these are the things you should have been thinking about."

You have 2 central pawns on dark squares right now so your bishop has limited scope and that knight has been jumping around everywhere causing trouble.  So this trade is not that terrible for you.

I could play Bxc6 to force bxc6 (with or without a queen exchange) and stuff his pawns up.  But I want to keep the threat alive for now.  Bg5 is also threatening to double-up his pawns

I thought that the obvious d3 was too simple not to have been considered by white so I decided to try to play aggressively. 
I thought about Qf3 and I remember I found a refutation move by white but I cannot remember which one. Of course after Nc3 black has to cope with the possibility of Ne4.
I considered white's b3 in order to get a good pin against my knight and the possible tactic after Nd3+ taking the rook. Still I didn't see a clear win and white hasn't to play b3 inmediately.
So I played Qe7 following one of the thematic moves of this opening but looking hard where would it lead me to...

But it has a disadvantage: it blocks the white queen's action. 
I considered d6 (but it was as to say Qe7 had no point).
Then a4 trying to prevent white to develop his dsb on b2 but this position is so good for white he can easily let me take a4xb3!
Then I considered g6 Qh6 but I cannot go on in chasing the queen... f5...? maybe. But maybe ""chasing the queen"" had another roads: 
h6! I think given the bad black position it is a good move since it threats g6 winning the queen!
White has a few move here: g3 hoping to exchange queens on h4 (leaving him a direct hit on my kingside in trade of doubled pawns in the h file - but he can use those pawns for a future attack so maybe it is a good trade for him. Maybe I can improve this some way.
Another move for white: Qf4
But in this case I thought I could play d5 freeing my position a little.

The continuation would have majorly disrupted black's pawn structure creating two isolated pawns as well as remove the queens from the board taking the queens out makes it easier to calculate continuations.

Because of these weaknesses it would be unlikely for black to castle kingside now and with the hole on the c-file it looks like his king will be staying in the center making it easier to focus my eventual attack.

Originally mentioned by Polerio in 1590 the Defense was rarely played until H. Caro of Berlin and M. Kann of Vienna seriously analyzed it in the 1890s. Capablanca frequently played it to avoid book lines. It can be highly successful against aggressive opponents but the CK lacks attacking possibilities. Patience and endgame skill are usually needed by Black to win."

Choices for white are: 
a) Bg3
b) Kf1
c) Kh1
d) Bg4
e) Qg4

a) 24. Bg3 looks good. 

The first answer to  be considered is
a1) 24. ... Bxe6. This is good for me because it follows: 
     25. Rxd2+ and black has 3 moves: 

1+) 25. ... Bd7 that is no good for black for
     26. Qe5 and black ends loosing the bishop
2++) 25. ... Kc8
     26. Qc5+ and I win or
3+) 25. ... Ke7 that doesn't make me win inmediately but I keep good tactic resources. 

The second answer for black is
2+) 24. ... Rd3.
White can play 
25. Qh4+ that seems to provide good tactics for white even after
25. ... Bg5
26. Qxg5 QxQ
26. RxR Qg7
27. Rxbd7+ QxR
28. BxQ KxB and white is up a piece. 
or: 
25. Bc4 Bg4 
26. Qh4+ and white ends with more material.

Black doesn't seem to have other answer so Bg3 is a good move here providing equality at least unless black fails somewhere. 

b) 24. Kf1
It mantains free the dsb. 

If black takes the bishop
24. ... Bxe6 
25. Rxd2+
Black has several answers here with more or less the same as in the previous analysis but with two differences. 
The first is that black has to cope with the threat Be5 that pins the queen.
The second is that blacks has the threat Bc4+ Ke1 Qg1#.

If black covers the king with 24. ... Bd7 he loses his threat. Whte doesn't have the chance 25. Rxd7+ Qxd7 26. Rd1 because of Rd3. White can answer
27. Qh4+ but black has two answers: 
1+) 27. ... Ke8 that looses material after
28. Re1+ Kf7 
29. Qf4+ Kg6 
30. Qe4+ Kf7
31. Qc4+ Kf8 (Kg6 looses after Re6+)
32. Qf4+ Kg8
33. Be4 where the black rook is trapped even if black plays Qh3+ 34. Kg1.

2-) 27. ... Kc8
28. Qc4+ Qc6
29. QxR KxB and material is even! (No use for black to play Qh1+ 30. Ke2 Re8+ 31. Kd2 QxR+ 32. KxQ 33. Re8 34. QxR+ KxQ and white has a free bishop!)

After 27. Qa5+ Kc8 28. Rc1+ KxB 29. Qe4+ Ka7 30. QxR(h8) etc material is even again. 

So 26. Rxd7+ leads only to even result.

But white can play directly 27. Be5 pinning the black queen. I cannot see any good move for black but to loose a quality. 
Better is for black not to cover the king and again we have 2 moves: 

1-) 25. ... Kc8 that keeps the mate threat over white. white has to care about his rook on a1 too so he must play 27. Qc5+ KxB and white has nothing since 28. Ra1-d1 leads to be mated starting with Bh+.

No need to analyze Kf8 since it is not difficult for black to find Kc8. 

So 25. Rxd7+ doesn't seem to be a good way to progress for white. 

Now what happens if white plays 25. Qa5+ instead? Nothing. 
And what if white plays 25. Qc4? Black gets the hand with Bh3+.

So no b) Kf1. 

c) 24. Kh1 has the disadvantage of Bc6+.
My God even 25. f3 seems to be possible. Bxf3 
26. Qxf3 Rxf3
27. Rxd2+ if Ke7 
28. Rd7+ and it is better for black to play KxB that leads to equality (29. RxQ RxB) than  Kf6 (29. RxQ KxR 30. Be5+ Rf6 31. Rg1+ winning the rook).

790,34,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Trap and counter trap makes this an entertaining game.
791,34,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch German grandmaster considered this to be the only correct defense against the Queen's gambit.
792,34,2,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The main problem for Black in Queen's Gambit opening is his bishop on c8. Tarrasch's idea was to solve that problem by this exchange 4...exd5. Now the bishop on c8 is ready to take part in the game much early. The drawback of this opening is the Black pawn on d5 which is likely to become isolated which could be a double edged position. The struggle revolves around the Black's isolani on d5 whether it is a strength or weakness. 
793,34,3,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Polish super grandmaster Akiba Rubinstein discovered the best set up against the Tarrasch defense with 6. g3 and almost demolished the Tarrasch defense. His idea was to fianchetto White's bishop on g2 and put pressure on the d5 pawn. Recently Gary Kasparov played this opening in his games and so interest has revived in the Tarrasch defense again.
794,34,4,1Nxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now the d5 pawn is blockaded and the battle begins.

796,34,6,bxc6,b'r1bqrbk1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/8/2N1B1P1/PP2PPBP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',"White exchanges knights which brings a support to the d5 pawn. The pawns at d5 and c6 are separated from other pawns. They cannot be supported by pawns and so black has to support them using his pieces. Such a formation of pawns is called ""hanging pawns"". If we look at the pawn structure Black has 3 pawn islands and White has 2 pawn islands. Pawn islands are a weakness in the endgame. So the strategy for White is to blockade the hanging pawns and force Black to tie down his pieces in defense and to breakup the position at the right time and proceed to the endgame."
797,34,7,1Na4,b'r1bqrbk1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/3p4/N7/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/2RQ1RK1 b - -',14. Na4 increases the blockade of the c6 pawn which is also attacked by the White Rook on the c-file. The square c5 is under pressure from White's knight on a4 bishop on e3 and Rook on c1.
798,34,8,1Qa5,b'r1b1rbk1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/q2p4/N7/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/2RQ1RK1 w - -',14...Qa5?! gives some support to the c5 square but this is a pawn sacrifice. Black is probably not inclined to support the hanging pawns and tie-down his pieces. I also thought that this is a trap if the c6 pawn is taken. Black has declared aggressive intentions. After a closer look at the position I played the next move.
799,34,9,1Rxc6,b'r1b1rbk1/p4pp1/2R2n1p/q2p4/N7/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/3Q1RK1 b - -',One of the hanging pawns is taken.

Is White wrong in grabbing a pawn? Tarrasch's ideas are beginning to take shape.
801,34,11,1Bd2,b'r3rbk1/p2b1pp1/2R2n1p/q2p4/N7/6P1/PP1BPPBP/3Q1RK1 b - -',This was a move attacking the Black's queen which gives White a tempo. Black has to protect his Queen.

804,34,14,1gxf6,b'r3rbk1/p2b1p2/5p1p/1q1p4/N7/6P1/PP1BPPBP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Black gladly accepts the Rook. 
805,34,15,1Nc3,b'r3rbk1/p2b1p2/5p1p/1q1p4/8/2N3P1/PP1BPPBP/3Q1RK1 b - -',White takes his knight out of the firing line and simultaneously attacks Black's queen and the d5 pawn thus gaining another tempo.
806,34,16,1Nxd5,b'r3rbk1/p2b1p2/q4p1p/3N4/8/6P1/PP1BPPBP/3Q1RK1 b - -',Now the hanging pawns have vanished and material is even. White's Rook sacrifice was in fact a decoy. Now Black king's castle is open on the g-file. White's knight attacks the f6 pawn.
807,34,17,1Rac8,b'2r1rbk1/p2b1p2/q4p1p/3N4/8/6P1/PP1BPPBP/3Q1RK1 w - -',A good move. Black removes his Rook on a1 from the discovered attack from White's bishop on g2. The Rook occupies its position on an open file.
808,34,18,2Bc3,b'2r1rbk1/p2b1p2/q4p1p/3N4/8/2B3P1/PP2PPBP/3Q1RK1 b - -',20. Bc3 is a double attack. The bishop attacks the f6 pawn and White's queen X-ray attacks the bishop on d7. White's pawn on a2 is hanging. The game is now in the realm of tactics.
809,34,19,2Bg7,b'2r1r1k1/p2b1pb1/q4p1p/3N4/8/2B3P1/PP2PPBP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Black protects his f6 pawn.

813,34,23,2Qg4,b'2r1r1k1/p4pb1/q4p1p/3N4/2b3Q1/2B1P1P1/PP3PBP/4R1K1 b - -',White's Queen occupies the g-file and intensifies the pressure. The bishop on g7 is pinned and Nxf6 is threatened.
814,34,24,2Kh8,b'2r1r2k/p4pb1/q4p1p/3N4/2b3Q1/2B1P1P1/PP3PBP/4R1K1 w - -',Black moves his king and frees his g7 bishop.

816,34,26,2Bxf6,b'2r1r2k/p4p2/q4b1p/8/2b3Q1/2B1P1P1/PP3PBP/4R1K1 w - -',A crucial position which White had planned for. Now Black's bishop on f6 is protected by the queen on a6. If the queen was not there White can play 25. Bxf6+ Kh7 26. Qg7 mate. Is there a way to divert the queen?
817,34,27,2Bb7,b'2r1r2k/pB3p2/q4b1p/8/2b3Q1/2B1P1P1/PP3P1P/4R1K1 b - -',"That is the move!!! If the bishop is taken then Black is mated. If not Queen has to move and REMAIN on the 6th rank to protect her bishop on f6 then Bxc8! wins back the exchange for White and he will be 3 pawns plus which is sufficient to win the game. So black resigns. Rubinstein's bishop did prove its value.

Hope you enjoyed the game as much as we did. I thank Black for his trap and tactics which allowed us to have this entertaining game."

830,36,0,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',My last game in what for me has been an interesting and exciting tournament and a win that ensures my final place 'in the points'. Action starts at move 9.
831,36,1,Bxg4,b'rn1q1b1r/ppp1p2p/2k3p1/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',The first 6 moves are forced to the starting position. Up to here is pretty much forced or White has too high a material defecit. Black could try ...Ke8 but as white wants the king in the open he can threaten a 3-fold repetition draw with Bf7. ...Kd6 is not an option because Bf7+ wins the queen back.
832,36,2,Qg8,b'rn4qr/ppp1p1bp/2k1N1p1/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The favoured moves for both sides at this point in the tournament - The bishop controls the long diagonal and the queen defends it. White is down in material so shouldn't be looking for exchanges. Black is restricted in movement so White needs to develop ASAP and attack the open king before black can un-tangle his pieces.
833,36,3,1d4,b'rn4qr/ppp1p1bp/2k1N1p1/8/3PpPB1/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQ d3',My favoured next move as white - Either black must accept that his bishop is cut off or he takes exd e.p. and the advanced pawn is out of my way when I reply with cxd.
834,36,4,1exd3e.p.,b'rn4qr/ppp1p1bp/2k1N1p1/8/5PB1/3p4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The usual response and the one I was hoping for.
835,36,5,1cxd3,b'rn4qr/ppp1p1bp/2k1N1p1/8/5PB1/3P4/PP4PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',And I have an open file in front of his king. Now I need to work on getting my knight and bishop moving or as happened in an earlier game if black plays the knight to a6 I will try tempting it forward perfectly willing to swap it for my inactive bishop and activating the rook possibly with check if the king remains there.
836,36,6,1Bh3,b'rn4qr/ppp1p1b1/2k1N1p1/7p/5P2/3P3B/PP4PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Forced as the knight must stay defended and remain on his lovely outpost. Bf3+ allows the king to escape via d7. I want my bishop to cut off that route when the knight eventually has to move or threaten a discovered check if the king tries to escape early.
837,36,7,1b6,b'rn4qr/p1p1p1b1/1pk1N1p1/7p/5P2/3P3B/PP4PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',So the king is trying to escape that way?
838,36,8,1g3,b'rn4qr/p1p1p1b1/1pk1N1p1/7p/5P2/3P2PB/PP5P/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Giving my bishop the option of both diagonals and threatening to win a rook should the king retreat to b7. This is really an empty threat as after Bxa8 ...c6 locks my bishop out of the game. I need my pieces active.
839,36,9,1Na6,b'r5qr/p1p1p1b1/npk1N1p1/7p/5P2/3P2PB/PP5P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',That knight is probably aiming to shift mine by going to c5 or aiming for d3 or c2 via b4.
840,36,10,1d4,b'r5qr/p1p1p1b1/npk1N1p1/7p/3P1P2/6PB/PP5P/RNB1K2R b KQ -',So as mentioned earlier don't give him c5 tempt him to b4. 
841,36,11,1Nb4,b'r5qr/p1p1p1b1/1pk1N1p1/7p/1n1P1P2/6PB/PP5P/RNB1K2R w KQ -',And he obliges.

This also gets my other knight into play and I'm looking for possible openings on his king. I'm now hoping for ...Nd3+.
843,36,13,1Ke2,b'r5qr/p1p1p1b1/1pk1N1p1/7p/3P1P2/N2n2PB/PP2K2P/R1B4R b - -',This series of moves has served me well in previous games. Now hoping the knight for bishop exchange will prove too tempting as black may feel that exchanges are good for his material advantage.
844,36,14,1Nxc1+,b'r5qr/p1p1p1b1/1pk1N1p1/7p/3P1P2/N5PB/PP2K2P/R1n4R w - -',And it does!

Judging by comments in the game I think Bob started to feel a bit uncomfortable here.
846,36,16,1Rxc7+,b'r5qr/pkR1p1b1/1p2N1p1/7p/3P1P2/N5PB/PP2K2P/7R b - -',Rook to the 7th rank with tempo and another rook soon to back it up.

848,36,18,2Qf7,b'r6r/p1R1pqb1/kp2N1p1/7p/3P1P2/N5PB/PP2K2P/2R5 w - -',Presumably trying to release the h8 rook.
849,36,19,2Rc1c6,b'r6r/p1R1pqb1/kpR1N1p1/7p/3P1P2/N5PB/PP2K2P/8 b - -',I decided against Nc5+ as black didn't have to capture it and if he chose not to it would have got in my way. Also I still like it where it is keeping that queen at bay.
850,36,20,2Nxd4,b'r6r/p1R1pq2/kpR3p1/7p/3N1P2/N5PB/PP2K2P/8 b - -',Not sure why Black finally decided to trade off his bishop for that pawn - it may give the queen more freedom but can he really afford to lose a piece and allow another of mine closer to his king?
851,36,21,2Be6,b'r2r4/p1R1pq2/kpR1B1p1/7p/3N1P2/N5P1/PP2K2P/8 b - -',Be5! - I believe this wins for White. Either black loses the queen for a bishop or it's mate in 5.

Interesting that Black should do the same on his first move but then I'd normally play 1... Nc6 as a response to 1. Nf3 when I'm black. That influenced my second move which probably influenced Black's: a keenly contested centre.

889,38,17,1Kxd1,b'6k1/2p2ppp/p3bn2/1p2p3/4P3/2N4P/PPP1BPP1/3K4 b - -',...and Black agrees. The reason behind exchanging the six major pieces was to allow our kings more freedom on the board. If this was in a newspaper this looks like a good position to begin analysing from: one open file (although open files are probably no longer an issue now that the major pieces are gone) with both of us having a light-square bishop a knight and seven pawns apiece.
