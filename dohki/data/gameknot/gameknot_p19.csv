The Polish Opening, also known as the Sokolsky Opening (named after Alexey Sokolsky) relates to the closed openings and is considered an irregular opening. It ranks 9th in popularity and I would seldom recommend using this opening in high level chess play, ex tournaments etc. It does immediately give black an advantage off the bat after the first move, so using this against high level players will not turn out good. They will not give any advantage back to you! But I managed to take back advantage mid game, and secure the win during the end game mostly because he didn't know how to react to certain moves. Basically the whole game, I am working my way up through the middle of his defenses with strategically placed ""bubbles"" I created by taking certain pieces of his, or allowing him to take some of my pieces. But a win is a win and I will take it. :) "

This is not the strongest opening, but may offer psychological advantages. It also doesn't give away your opening advantage like many other openings, which may come to a shock considering the first move doesn't look like you're doing much. This opening is labeled as A01 also. If you watch the whole game, you can slowly see my pieces sneaking their way over to his king-side moving in for the checkmate. I wish my opponent wouldn't have resigned so I could show the whole game, but that just proves this opening can be super strong given practice, ability and confidence. :)

The Ware Opening (1. a4) is often dismissed as a pointless move, doing nothing for development. However, like every move, it does have its advantages. In this game, I manage to use the a-pawn to open up the queen-side, allowing a rook penetration down the opened files and ultimately, a win. It is named after U.S. chess player Preston Ware, who often played uncommon openings. The Ware is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings. I would consider this an ""okay"" opening for regular play. The advantages of using this opening is that it does open up their queen-side and allow for a quick checkmate like in my game, if they don't know how to properly react to such an irregular opening. If used in high-level chess, it would most likely end in a draw, but if you get lucky you could pull a win using this. I would not recommend this though as it does give away your opening advantage, and also gives some advantage to black right off the bat, and if you are playing a well experienced player, it will be very hard to get that advantage back."

But, that's what I'm keeping in mind is the obvious threat.  Bear in mind that this is where I applied an idea that fiercequeen mentioned with her Q sac.  And, that was combined with some of TA's irregular openings.  Not even the blitz Q sacs, but he doesn't develop anything until the midgame, whereas, his opponent develops and controls the center early.  That should favor his opponent, but TA wins the game, anyway.  In my case, it's a threat that would not be difficult to drive off in which white would face some problems.  Worth noting that if I had more time, I would not make a threat that's so easy to drive off.

The most aggressive approaches to playing against the KID normally involve White playing e2-e4 fairly early on.

Obviously, 5.e4 would be impossible in this position, since Black's knight is covering e4; however, 5.Nc3 or 5.Nd2 followed by 6.e4 would be a more ambitious approach.

On reflection, though, I don't think this is a particularly helpful move for Black at this stage; it would have been more useful to continue the typical KID plan of d7-d6 and e7-e5. Furthermore, the advance of this pawn might well create weaknesses on Black's queenside later.

The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense for black against the e4 push from white. The Dragon Variation is the most aggressive and sharpest line that black has in the Sicilian Defense.
White has many options that he can respond with. The most common is the Yugoslav Attack but this is a double edge sword. White will castle on the queen side, black will castle on the king side and both will have very sharp options to attack their opponents king. This is one of Magnus Carlsen’s favorite lines and has had much success playing as black, opening up the defense white has on the queen side.
Some of the other options white has are the Classical Variation, the Levenfish and the Harrington-Glek.
My personally favorite line is the Levenfish. With the idea in mind to attack the king side of black, white makes an early aggressive push with his f pawn to f4. This poses many problems for black and is forced to mix up his normal developement to defend the e pawn from white pushing forward.
There are so many exciting lines in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense, it is a must study for any chess player.

I highly recommend using this at any level of chess play. But do be cautious as it is very hard to use, and one wrong move and you're giving the game away."

Luckily for me, I played this game in live chess, and I encountered a lower ranked player and if you look back I won in 21 moves only because they didn't know how to react to this opening, I am guessing because of how rare it is.

So, I was thinking about how to pin it.  Of course, my Bf8 is not an option.  If I didn't continue with the normal 2...d6 which is what you do in this defense, I would've played 6...e5 to allow 7...Bb4.  Since it's not an option, this was the only other way to pin.
