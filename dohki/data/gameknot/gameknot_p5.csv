So in my last annotated game against the Caveman, Coach Ion concluded that Fou Leblanc had let Henry down a bundle by moving to the wrong square.  In this game I find myself in another piece ending and with both sides having light square bishops.  In the endgame I end up being the player with the pawn plus against my fellow Class A opponent.  But will this give Fou Leblanc the opportunity to make amends and to help Henry bring the game to a satisfactory conclusion? Well, you'll just have to read on."
142,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',1. ….. d5 - white kicks off with the Reti Opening and I make the most common response to it.

I break the general opening guidelines by getting my Q out early.  Now when studying these openings, Jack emphasized that pieces need to be developed.  In fact, I went wrong against him by failing to do that, even though, the Q was not early.  My goal here is to trick Tom into making a mistake by not advancing his d pawn.  If I can capture on d6, the pin will be right there.  I generally don't go for tricks but was concerned about adjourning early.  This usually isn't an issue since I generally have to be out by noon, due to the work schedule.  However, I was off on Friday since I got called the day prior.  And, I'd rather lose a game and play poorly then not be able to finish it.  But, I now know for next time that the Senior Center does not kick anyone out, if they're late.

Jack showed a similar example on the same square with the Guaco Piano, as after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Be7 is best to prevent advancing the d pawn, followed by Ng5 which would lead to the same type of fork.

On the other hand, kenneth_fiore_3 said that I needed to give more thought then just that.  For a while, I hadn't, until other commentators said that it's generally better to do it in a more aggressive way.  After careful consideration, I thought that doing it more aggressively was better to gain two tempii.  10.Be2 wouldn't have done it since Tom could just leave his B on g4.  Was it worth it, though?  I think not, and do believe that breaking it more passively was better here.  As this is bound to give Tom a space advantage.  It will further weaken my K side since I use the other pawn, after 10...Bh5.  That wasn't just tempo but getting a pawn chain which was meaningless.
