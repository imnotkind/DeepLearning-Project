It is easy to see WT enjoys a space advantage with his ""ideal center"" of e4 and d4 ... compared to the so-called 'small' or 'minor' center of BL on d6 & e6. But what is especially deceptive here is WT's lead in development. (What?! Why both sides have o-o & developed 2 minor pieces yes?) WT's pieces could conceivably come to use where they stand whereas blacks will be somewhat self-blocking. But this is a part of the natural WT advantage in many postions. The benefits of the first move. They dont come to natural use in this game and must be repositioned to increase scope later. "

I felt a wait appropriate here since I do not have a enough development nor lead in it to initiate a successful attack now; but do have a significant space advantage that will not go away. Often such factors favor taking time to buildup

He might have considered Na6 instead which also supports ...c5 and could then move to Nc7 and there support a ...b5 push if WT were to answer ...c5 with d5. Ending up in a very Modern-Benoni-like formation for BL.

Additionally it prevents the lift of ...Rf5 later to block WT's Bishop from the h7 square which was a saving resource vs an 18.Bxh6 sac. Now 19.Bxh6 would work insofar as being an untakable Bishop.

If the Q recapture were not available it would pay to look at the Rook alternative and review the attacking ideas therein which focus most importantly upon the idea of eliminating the Nf6  removing defense of the h7 mating square. 
In such lines WT should realize that important concepts to analyze involve seeing the move Bg5 both with or without Bxh6 preceding it as well as just Bxh6. 
By Bg5 WT could eliminate the Nf6 defender even if backed-up by Nce8.  And once the B is moved from c1 it would allow the final WT attacker the Ra1 to enter the fray if needed. Thus in such position the attacker might even consider moves such as Bg5/Bh6 simply as a clearance sac even if it had no other purpose so as to involve that Rook in the matter. 
To students of tactics ""Take three points"" as they say :)
if you looked at the 2 B moves and saw all three reasons for considering them. 1)Clearance (2)re-attack of Nf6 by Bg5  & (3)line opening by Bh6 ... important general concepts of attack.  }8-)"

Last move I mentioned part of the reason to look at a move like Bxh6 being line opening. This may cause one to ask ""What? I thought that refers to opening My Own lines to attack upon."" Answer:Yes it usually does. However consider it a more advanced concept then that it can also include opening Opponent's Lines!
... in the field of attack. Why might you Want to do that>? Well largely because in such position as it is advantageous you Gain scope upon the opponents line opened if you can take control of it. 
For instance here (disregard any other tactics or consequences this is just to make a case in point example not explain this position especially) if gxh6 were played note how that if WT could capture that pawn or if the B is not taken and if in either case WT could gain control of that H-File ... he is no longer striking there at only h6 where the pawn was. With a R or Q there now he would also be striking clear thru the File to h7 and h8 as well.! In fact if that Ng6 were then to stay there a Q could mate by Qh8 or if the Nf6 were to move then a Q on the h-file could mate by Qh7. Thus by opening an Opponents Line WT would have made the BL position possess greater exposure and more lines of entry into it as well. Do you see my point then? 
[One opening where this is more commonly illustrated would be in the h-file attack of the Yugoslav Dragon Sicilian. There are situations where BL will avoid responding to h5xg6 there by h7xg6 for just the reason I've illustrated above and instead go f7xg6. Especially if he has played his B back to Bh8 since then it might be subject to capture or sac capture there rather than helping guard h8 as if it were still a Bg7 there. ]"

We are now 14 moves into the game and only two of my pawns have moved while only one white pawn has moved.  The knights and queens are the only pieces that have actually seen play.  Out of 28 total moves 11 of them have been queen moves and 9 of them have been knight moves."

Nxb6 gets Nc2   Qxb6 ends up with white down a piece and anything else loses the queen or the knight.  The only valid response to Rxb7 is axb6.  Anything else still allows Nc7 .
155,5,24,Qc5,b'Q1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/1p6/2qNp3/3n3N/8/P3PPPP/4KB1R w Kk -',With this move I did three things.  Most importantly I defended the bishop.  Without defense the queen would rip through my entire back rank.  However just a little defense is enough because white has so few pieces in play.  The second part of this move is continuing to pressure the knight.  That means that the queen is limited to only a few squares.  Last but far from least I threaten mate with Qc1  .  The best response is probably f3 opening up a bolt hole.
156,5,25,Nc2+,b'Q1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/1p6/2qNp3/7N/5P2/P1n1P1PP/4KB1R w Kk -',I check white for two reasons: to prevent any hope of castling (not that there really was any) and to get the king out in the open.  My goal is check the white king enough that I can get my dark bishop into play enabling me to castle my white bishop to safety.
157,5,26,Nb4,b'Q1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/1p6/2qNp3/1n5N/5P2/P2KP1PP/5B1R w k -',Because of the placement of the white king this move is a win no matter what happens.  If white responds with Nxb4 I get Qxb4  starting a sequence that eventually frees my bishops.  If white responds with e4 choosing to defend the knight either Nxd5 or Qc2  either results in trading off the queens (Qxd5 Qxd5) or freeing my bishops.  Doing neither loses the knight.
158,5,27,Qxb4+,b'Q1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/1p6/4p3/1q5N/5P2/P2KP1PP/5B1R w k -',My king is now no longer in any real danger.  The only worry is losing the bishop which will be taken care of in the next few moves.

Coincidentally though the only valid check puts me in position to defend my light bishop while freeing my dark bishop.  After Bb4 white has to decide whether to defend the king or save the knight.  Meanwhile the white queen is forced to watch from the corner.

Fortuantely the white knight is easy to bump.
163,5,32,2e4,b'Q1b1k2r/3p1p1p/1p4p1/4pN2/1bq1P3/5P2/P5PP/3K1B1R b k e3',Rather than move the knight [24. N?? Qd4  25. Kc2 Qc3  26. Kb1 Ba3] white chooses to attack my queen.  I think e3 would have been a much stronger move but e4 serves the purpose.
164,5,33,2Qc3,b'Q1b1k2r/3p1p1p/1p4p1/4pN2/1b2P3/2q2P2/P5PP/3K1B1R w k -',Remaining on the c file I advance my queen into mating position.  The only direct move that can prevent Qd2   is Qd5.

(If he hadn't made the sacrifice we get: 25. Qd5 Qa1  26. Ke2 Qb2  27. Kd1 Bb7 28. Qd3 Ba6 leaving the queen with no way to continue to defend e7 against mate.)
166,5,35,2Bxd6,b'Q1b1k2r/3p1p1p/1p1b2p1/4p3/4P3/2q2P2/P5PP/3K1B1R w k -',"I didn't have much choice but to accept the sacrifice.  Ke7 takes the heat off my light bishop but it leaves the white knight there to prevent my light bishop from participating in the king chase.  White managed to rob me of my chance for an early mate but paid for it by entering the end game materially disadvantaged.
Fortunately for me though at this point white's only active piece is his queen.  My only real danger spot is my e pawn.  After Qd5 if my queen and bishop lose sight of my e pawn white can steal my rook.  White's current worry is that moving his bishop off the first rank loses his remaining rook to Qa1 ."
167,5,36,2Qd5,b'2b1k2r/3p1p1p/1p1b2p1/3Qp3/4P3/2q2P2/P5PP/3K1B1R b k -',White leaves me with the decision of whether to trade queens and slug it out in the end game (Qd4 )  or to regroup and continue trying to catch the white king (Bb4).
168,5,37,2Bb4,b'2b1k2r/3p1p1p/1p4p1/3Qp3/1b2P3/2q2P2/P5PP/3K1B1R w k -',"Ultimately I decided to continue hounding the white king.  I figured that I would have the option of the queen trade for at least a couple more moves and with only the queen in play there isn't too much damange that white can do.  By resuming the bishop's post on b4 the white queen is forced to guard the d2 square.  The white bishop is locked down by the Qa1  threat.  The white rook is trapped.  The white king's only move is Ke2 which gets mate is a couple of moves.  The only moves white has at this point are pawns and Qd3.
We're now 26 moves into the game and still the queens and knights have dominated play.  Of the remaining pieces other than the queens only two have moved: the white king and the black bishop.  That leaves 5 out of 9 pieces untouched with 6 out of 11 pawns untouched."

181,5,50,b5,b'5rk1/R4p1p/3p2p1/1pb1p3/4P3/2K2P2/6PP/8 w - -',I use the fortunate positioning to advance by b pawn two ranks.
182,5,51,Ra8,b'r5k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p3/1p2P3/1K3P2/6PP/8 w - -',Now my objective is to get my rook over to the white g and h pawns.  If I can get a passed pawn on either side of the board it's pretty much over.
183,5,52,4h4,b'r5k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p3/1p2P2P/1K3P2/6P1/8 b - h3',White split his g and h pawns to make them harder to chase down.
184,5,53,4Ra3+,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p3/1p2P2P/rK3P2/6P1/8 w - -',This check was to bump the king so I could get my rook onto the second rank.
185,5,54,Ra2,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p3/1pK1P2P/5P2/r5P1/8 w - -',I'm really after the f pawn here but first I have to chase off the g pawn.
186,5,55,Rf2,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p3/1pK1P1PP/5P2/5r2/8 w - -',The f pawn is now lost opening the way for a second pawn charge down the king-side.  In theory.
187,5,56,4h5,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p2P/1pK1P1P1/5P2/5r2/8 b - -',White offered an innocuous pawn trade which turned out to be a nasty trap.  In considering my next move I looked right at the trap but failed to recongnize it.
188,5,57,4Rxf3,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2p1/2b1p2P/1pK1P1P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',Mistake of the game!  I was feeling a little too confident and wasn't paying enough attention.  This move almost cost me the game.
189,5,58,4h6,b'6k1/1R3p1p/3p2pP/2b1p3/1pK1P1P1/5r2/8/8 b - -',My king is now locked into the corner waiting for Rb8  !  Even worse white now has a shot at running his h pawn to the 8th rank.
190,5,59,4f5,b'6k1/1R5p/3p2pP/2b1pp2/1pK1P1P1/5r2/8/8 w - f6',I had to open up some room for my king.  I chose f5 instead of f6 for a couple of reasons.  First white will not capture my f pawn.  Doing so would give me a nice opportunity to get my g pawn out from between my king and his h pawn.  Also f5 gives my king more room to work and the potential of opening the f file so I can send my rook to the rescue.  And at a minimum it put's another pawn in the running for promotion.
191,5,60,4Rg7+,b'6k1/6Rp/3p2pP/2b1pp2/1pK1P1P1/5r2/8/8 b - -',It's amazing how being ill can affect one's mind.  The *obviously* correct response to this is Kh8.  Instead...
192,5,61,4Kf8,b'5k2/6Rp/3p2pP/2b1pp2/1pK1P1P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',I chose Kf8?? Giving white an honest chance at promoting his pawn.
193,5,62,4exf5,b'5k2/6Rp/3p2pP/2b1pP2/1pK3P1/5r2/8/8 b - -',White captures my f pawn to get my g pawn out of his way.  Now that I have opened the door to promoting his pawn the game has completely changed.
194,5,63,4gxf5,b'5k2/6Rp/3p3P/2b1pp2/1pK3P1/5r2/8/8 w - -',The best move here is probably g5 blocking off support for the h pawn.  Instead my diseased mind found it better to capture.
195,5,64,5g5,b'5k2/6Rp/3p3P/2b1ppP1/1pK5/5r2/8/8 b - -',And now white is in a beautiful position.
196,5,65,5b3,b'5k2/6Rp/3p3P/2b1ppP1/2K5/1p3r2/8/8 w - -',Failing to notice that I'm about to lose the game I decide to mak e a run for it with my b pawn.
197,5,66,5Rxh7,b'5k2/7R/3p3P/2b1ppP1/2K5/1p3r2/8/8 b - -',At this point it finally dawned on me that I might not be playing at my best.  Before I could do more damage I stopping playing until I was well again.
198,5,67,5Rg3,b'5k2/7R/3p3P/2b1ppP1/2K5/1p4r1/8/8 w - -',"After recovering Rg3 was the only move left to me that left me a chance of winning.  Below are the non-draw alternatives.

199,5,68,5Rb7,b'5k2/1R6/3p3P/2b1ppP1/2K5/1p4r1/8/8 b - -',I was very happy to see this move.  It meant that I had broken the charge of the h pawn.  Being up by a pawn of a bishop I was very willing to trade passed pawns especially considering my pawn-bishop pair and the fact that the white h pawn becomes a pain point for white.
200,5,69,5Rxg5,b'5k2/1R6/3p3P/2b1ppr1/2K5/1p6/8/8 w - -',With a great sigh of relief I captured the white pawn.  I thought it was all over.  I was wrong.
201,5,70,5Rb8+,b'1R3k2/8/3p3P/2b1ppr1/2K5/1p6/8/8 b - -',Doh!  Never saw it coming.  Not like I had much of a choice in any case.  I sealed my fate several moves ago.
202,5,71,5Kf7,b'1R6/5k2/3p3P/2b1ppr1/2K5/1p6/8/8 w - -',I have to sit back and watch while I lose my rook.
203,5,72,b2,b'7R/5k2/3p4/2b1pp2/2K5/8/1p6/8 w - -',OK.  So white has now evened up the game.  Things still looked good for me though.  With four pawns one on the 7th rank and a bishop for support my odds of promoting a pawn looked pretty good.
204,5,73,5Rb8,b'1R6/5k2/3p4/2b1pp2/2K5/8/1p6/8 b - -',This move surprised me.  I expected Rh1 to stop the queen until the king could move into postion to guard b1.  The advantage of this move over Rh1 is that white has bought an extra turn that he can use to go after my d pawn.  The disadvantage is that the rook can only defend one file.
205,5,74,5Bd4,b'1R6/5k2/3p4/4pp2/2Kb4/8/1p6/8 w - -',I decided that it was more important to keep the pressure on with my b pawn than to save my d pawn.
206,5,75,5Kd5,b'1R6/5k2/3p4/3Kpp2/3b4/8/1p6/8 b - -',White moves in to threaten the d pawn and block my king's passage. 
207,5,76,5f4,b'1R6/5k2/3p4/3Kp3/3b1p2/8/1p6/8 w - -',By advancing my f pawn I rescued the d pawn.  If white captured the d pawn my f pawn is a run-away.  At this point the thing I was most worried about was white ability to burn moves by wiggling the rook.
208,5,77,5Rb3,b'8/5k2/3p4/3Kp3/3b1p2/1R6/1p6/8 b - -',White makes another brilliant play.  He prepares to safely take my d pawn by guarding my f pawn.  If I make a run for it with the f pawn white has the Zwischenzug Rxf3  which allows him to then return to guarding my b pawn before I can promote it.
209,5,78,5Kg6,b'8/8/3p2k1/3Kp3/3b1p2/1R6/1p6/8 w - -',I play wide removing the Zwischenzug.  Ke4 is white's only move.  Anything else lets either the f pawn or the b pawn get away.
210,5,79,d5+,b'8/8/6k1/3pp3/3bKp2/1R6/1p6/8 w - -',For the same reason that white couldn't capture my d pawn before he still can't now.  Same goes for Kd3.  White's only move is Kf3 driving the his king forward and allowing my pawns to advance.
211,5,80,Kf5,b'8/8/8/3ppk2/3b1p2/1R3K2/1p6/8 w - -',I close in with my king to support the charge.  This is the point where I was finally certain that I had won.
212,5,81,6Kg2,b'8/8/8/3ppk2/3b1p2/1R6/1p4K1/8 b - -',White decides to take control by moving the king instead of twiddling the rook and letting me check the king with e4.
213,5,82,6e4,b'8/8/8/3p1k2/3bpp2/1R6/1p4K1/8 w - -',White now has two choices: twiddle the rook or Kf1.  Kf1 is probably the better move because the rook creates a lot of pressure where it is.
214,5,83,f3+,b'8/1R6/8/3p1k2/3bp3/5p2/1p4K1/8 w - -',The pawn barrage marches onward.
215,5,84,6Kg3,b'8/1R6/8/3p1k2/3bp3/5pK1/1p6/8 b - -',I think white was trying keep my king from moving in to support the pawns.
216,5,85,6f2,b'8/1R6/8/3p1k2/3bp3/6K1/1p3p2/8 w - -',White is now hosed.  I have two pawns about to be promoted and white has two pieces with which to stop them.  That means my king and remaining two pawns are free to roam.
217,5,86,6Kg2,b'8/1R6/8/3p1k2/3bp3/8/1p3pK1/8 b - -',White has now other move.
218,5,87,6Kf1,b'8/1R6/8/3p1k2/3b4/4p3/1p3p2/5K2 b - -',White brings his king around to the other side of the f pawn to block my king from providing support.
219,5,88,6Ke2,b'8/1R6/8/3p4/3bk3/4p3/1p2Kp2/8 b - -',Perfactly timed to move into opposition.
220,5,89,6Bc3,b'8/1R6/8/3p4/4k3/2b1p3/1p2Kp2/8 w - -',Unfortunately white just has to sit back and watch while I bring the rest of my pieces into position.
221,5,90,6Rb8,b'1R6/8/8/3p4/4k3/2b1p3/1p2Kp2/8 b - -',White twiddles the rook because he doesn't want to yield to my king.
222,5,91,6d4,b'1R6/8/8/8/3pk3/2b1p3/1p2Kp2/8 w - -',I close the formation.  If white tries to check my king he will work his way over to the b pawn and bring it home.  If not then d3  e2  e1=Q .
223,5,92,6Re8+,b'4R3/8/8/8/3pk3/2b1p3/1p2Kp2/8 b - -',White opts to send my king travelling.
224,5,93,7Rb8,b'1R6/8/8/3k4/3p4/2b1p3/1p2Kp2/8 b - -',White returns to guarding the b pawn.  The purpose of all this was to separate my king from my pawns.
225,5,94,7d3+,b'1R6/8/8/3k4/8/2bpp3/1p2Kp2/8 w - -',Because of that check white has the option to capture either the e or d pawn.  Of course it doesn't make any difference.
226,5,95,7Kxe3,b'1R6/8/8/3k4/8/2bpK3/1p3p2/8 b - -',White having reached the point of inevitability resigns just before I can promote a pawn.

231,6,4,Bd2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPPB1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Most of the time White goes with Nc3 or Bd3 here. Bd2 seems pointless as we are about to find out.
232,6,5,Be2,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Very conservative opening from White doesn't seem to be interested in making trades straight away.
233,6,6,Be3,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPb2/3P4/4B3/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',A blunder. White only focuses on the d4 pawn and doesn't notice the b2 pawn (which was my goal). Bc3 was the best move here.
234,6,7,Qxc1+,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/4B3/P1bNBPPP/R1q1K1NR w KQkq -',Fritz shows Ba3 to be the move here instead of trading Queens. I remember thinking about this move for a long time and the only option I could come up with was trading Queens.

236,6,9,Bb4,b'rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P4/4BN2/P2NBPPP/2R1K2R w Kkq -',In the Caro-Kann I normally aim for making the c5 pawn move and taking back with my dark-square Bishop. This wasn't an option since White has his Bishop protecting it. Thanks to the capture of the c-and-b pawns I developed my Bishop here.

Black is probably looking to advance b pawn to try and open up the king's defence. Black is massively aggressive as I have found to my previous detriment and is demonstrated by the early attack of queen before all minor pieces are developed. B4 is a key square defensively for white. Bishop to take b5 could have some merit but opens up the a file for black. Black is yet to castle. Force queen to retreat with knight to b3. Still room for play in the centre and king side.

Knight to e1 then to f4 appears to leave queen side relatively well defended. Black will be looking to castle and then to open up the centre with d pawn advance possibly.

Knight can also move on queen side and has also protected the advance of black's b pawn. d4 is well protected by white. Knight moving here will free up bishop and allow rooks to become connected. c2 is also a possibility stopping any direct use of the knight.

What white isn't watching is ensuring the defence of individual pieces like the knight on g3. This knight is protecting the rook from the bishop but it itself has no protection. Black is looking to remove this knight leaving the rook exposed. White should have provided more defence for the knight on g3.

The ones I had to decide between in the end were e5 and d5. Both look good for white but e5 has various very tactical lines. d5 locks the position and the game develops slower. i think that the advantage is more sure with d5 but would be slow to convert into anything tangible. it would most probably be followed by d6 and exchange of the bishop for knight by black on c3. With e5 black's best reply seems to be cxd4. Bxf3 is also good. After Bxf3 white's pawns double exposing the king on an open g file. After cxd4 white could play exf6 or Bxh7 both of which look good. Probably moving the c knight at some point would be a good idea to avoid black exchaninging it for a useless bishop.
400,12,7,1Kh8,b'rn1q1r1k/pb1p2pp/1p2pp2/2p1P3/1bPP2nB/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',interesting move. i did not expect it. prevents white from taking on h7 with check. however i think that it is a 'slow' move and black needed a 'fast' move at this time. now white can simply play exf6 and black would be forced to play Nxf6 or gxf6 (otherwise white wins the black Q). Nxf6 definately looks the better of the two. After that white can decide about what to do with black's threat of cxd4. Options would include Ne4 Ne5 a3 Bxh7 etc..
401,12,8,Qc7,b'rn3r1k/pbqp3p/1p2pp2/8/1bPN3B/3B4/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',the space around black's king has opened up. however black now also has open files to place his rooks on to attack white's king in conjunction with his bishops. however black's N is still undeveloped.
402,12,9,Qd8,b'rn1q1r1k/pb1p3p/1p2pp2/8/1bPN4/3B2B1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',maybe Qc5 would have been better

This sequence of moves leaves white's white B weaker.

The N can't move the Q has few squares to go to and must protect f6. Black has to think of a way to liberate himself and white has to think of a way to use the space he has to attack.

The 2 general concepts in my mind at this time were to weaken the black pawns by moving my f-pawn up the board. This threat is quite real and near so black should move his king and play f5 as soon as possible. If white had played f4 immediately then 23..Na5 24.b3 Bxe4 25.Qxe4 f5 and black is now less cramped and white hasn't succeeded in weakening black's center pawns as he would have wished. The other thing I wanted to do was to double up on the d-file and exert pressure on black's backward d-pawn.

However the N has no squares where it is currently at. Black would be aiming to exchange bishops and then play the N to b7 or maybe even c6.

Once the rooks are doubled white can move the B from d6 and bring it to the long diagonal where it would be powerful. Also the Q would be protecting both d7 and f6 which could cause black problems.

Nxd6 would leave me without my dark bishop. In this position the dark bishop appears to be quite powerful. Placed on the a1-h8 diagonal it could cause black problems. However if I moved the bishop after a few moves black could advance the d-pawn (but if Nxd6 then Rxd6 keeps the d-pawn back and weak). And there were also 2 options if I decided to move my B - I could either bring it to the b2 square through a3 or I could take it to f4 and then play Bh6 at some point. So at this junction I was considering 3 moves: Ba3 Bf4 and a move in which I wouldn't move my B probably Qb2
415,12,22,2Ba3,b'2rq3k/1n1p2rp/ppb1pp2/8/2P1B3/BP3P2/P1QR2PP/3R2K1 b - -',This was a very difficult decision for me. I didn't play Qb2 because e5 by black didn't look good. I also didn't want to exchange much material right now because I fealt that the pressure was on black and exchanges would let some of the steam off. I didn't play Bf4 because it didn't seem to do much. Now black may be able to play d5 at some point which would give him space and strengthen his d-pawn. However white's bishop would be strong at b2.

Generally speaking the move 7.Nge2 has no sense its reason is purely psychological. I remembered that before the game when we discussed the strategy with [GM] Yury Dokhoian [RUS] he said suddenly looking through Topalov's games: ""You know Garry he does not like when the opponent makes the moves he can not predict. This affects him strangely."" That is why I played 7.Nge2 and surprised Topalov. This move does not contain any threats but continues the development.

It is important that there is no checkmate on d1 because the white King suddenly goes to a2 and it turns out that the threat Qb3 can be also supported by the King from the a2-square.     That is why the black Queen has to be on d5 (one has to understand this very important moment) in order to control the b3-square and to be able to play Qd4 if the white King is on b2.

Right now I'm looking at Nxf2 forking the rooks but we'll see if I figure out what my opponent is up to."

The other alternative Qg4 would have left me scrambling to avoid a mate (which I think I would have with advantage).  Lucky me."

He can forstall the exchange a little by Bxd7 but that only delays the inevitable and leaves him even more disadvantaged after the queen trade.  White's best move would probably be to break up the rook fork and claim my bishop after the trade.

1. If Black plays Bxc3  white can recapture with the queen avoiding doubled pawns on the c-file.

In this game I allowed the dpubled pawns anyway and used the c2-queen to help the e-pawn move to e4 in one go."

I felt that he would almost certainly play Nc6 to try and develop with tempo if I played Qxd4. But the advanced d-pawn would allow for a pin the consequnce of which would be that the queen in an active position would actually be quite stable for the moment.

I thought I either needed the e-file opened with tempo the c-7 pawn removed (or moved) to allow Rc4  or the Bishop to move so that my queen can safely move onto the back rank. With these thoughts in mind Bxd6 didn't seem so bad afterall! Capture with the Bishop results in mate in two:
20...Bxd6 21. Qa8  Kd7 22. Qxe8#.
Recapture with the pawn results in mate in three:
20...bxd6 21. Rc4  Kd8 22. Qb6  Kd7 23. Qc7#
or
20...bxd6 21. Rc4  Kd7 22. Qxb7  kd8 23. Qc7#.
