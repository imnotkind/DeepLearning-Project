0,0,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Here is my best game from the recent Brandon (MS) Open 2007. My real rating dipped a bit at this tourney but I did have a plus score of 2.5/4. Jack S. provided me the opportunity to get the old creative juices flowing and I was fortunate enough to crank out this beauty. My mojo was working during this round.....I hope you enjoy:)
1,0,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',QGD.  For those who know me I assure you I have not lost my mind with 1. Nf3. I'm still the boring Queen's Gambit player that I have always been. I merely have been flirting with the Reti lately and it is easily steerable into QG territory if desired.
2,0,2,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',QGD Exchange variation
3,0,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Absolutely true to form. Seen this a miilion times. I have always preferred to open the c file and play a quick Rc1. That means Nc3 and Bg5 come first.
4,0,4,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Pinning the knight and allowing Ne4.
5,0,5,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Deeming his pin easibly defended I establish one of my own.
6,0,6,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',I questioned this move somewhat. I feel that 7...Bg4 and an eventual Nbd7 was stronger.
7,0,7,Qd6,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Another move that just doesn't feel right. Black's light squared bishop needs to get it in gear. In post mortem my opponent expressed his desire to control the dark squares. Maybe he saw something I didn't. What I see is four actively developed white pieces dancing around the awkwardly placed enemy queen. Perhaps she can be harrassed......
8,0,8,a3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',First things first - 86 the Bb4. If 9...Ba5 then 10. b4 and I'll push the queenside with tempo. He's likely going to play BxN.
9,0,9,1bxc3,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p2B1/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Mission accomplished.
10,0,10,1Ne4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq4/3p2B1/3Pn3/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Hitting my bishop and my c pawn. As I really want to keep my dark squared bishop I can't allow this knight to have such a cushy post. He's gotta go.
11,0,11,1Bf4,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq4/8/3PpB2/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',No need to panic about my knights safety just yet. How about a little tempo first?
12,0,12,1Qd7,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2n5/8/3PpB2/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',? Ugly move. Black's light squared bishop is not only undeveloped but retarded as well. If black is so concerned about saving his c pawn then Qe7 is much much better.
13,0,13,1Ng5,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2n5/6N1/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',!? I felt that my opponent had just erred seriously enough to deserve a little punishment. I now threaten to win a pawn or even launch a volley at the enemy monarch.
14,0,14,1Ne7,b'r1b2rk1/pppqnppp/8/6N1/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Black must sense that I'm about to start knocking on his front door so he shifts resources to defend. This move doesn't accomplish near as much as he hopes for however. I start to develop attacking ideas to exploit his underdeveloped queenside.
15,0,15,1Qh5,b'r1b2rk1/pppqnppp/8/6NQ/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! I really liked this move. I am in no hurry to snag the e pawn. Better to start loosening up the enemy defenses first.
16,0,16,1h6,b'r1b2rk1/pppqnpp1/7p/6NQ/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Forced.
17,0,17,1Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/pppqnpp1/7p/7Q/3PNB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Now I pick up the pawn and it hits me! f6 is brutally weak. Wouldn't my knight look pretty sitting there?
18,0,18,1Ng6,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1pp1/6np/7Q/3PNB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Still not developed my opponent finishes what he started two moves ago and gets a defender over.
19,0,19,1Bxh6,b'r1b2rk1/pppq1pp1/6nB/7Q/3PN3/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! I double dog dare black to accept this sac. (16...gxB 17. Nf6  with a Royal Fork.)
20,0,20,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/pppq1pp1/6nB/7Q/3PN3/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black wisely declines the sac and establishes a threat of his own on my Ne4.
21,0,21,1Qf3,b'r1b1r1k1/pppq1pp1/6nB/8/3PN3/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',My knight is vital to my plan and must be protected. My bishop is still immune from capture because of the Nf6 threat.
22,0,22,1Qc6,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/2q3nB/8/3PN3/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',! Black's best move of the game. He now hits my Ne4 twice and has his own tactic (the pin on my queen).
23,0,23,1d5,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/2q3nB/3P4/4N3/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! White's best move of the game! A deflection sac!
24,0,24,1Qxd5,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/6nB/3q4/4N3/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?? In addition to not seeing the weakness of the f6 square Black leaves himself open for a crushing tactic.
25,0,25,1Nf6+,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2pp1/5NnB/3q4/8/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! Winning the black queen with the move I've been waiting for.
26,0,26,1gxf6,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2p2/5pnB/3q4/8/P1P1PQ2/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black gets far too little in exchange.
27,0,27,Be6,b'r3r1k1/ppp2p2/4bpnB/3Q4/8/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black finally gets his problem bishop into the game on move 20.
28,0,28,2Qd4,b'r3r1k1/ppp2p2/4bpnB/8/3Q4/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Threatening Qxf and then mate on g7.
29,0,29,2Kh7,b'r3r3/ppp2p1k/4bpnB/8/3Q4/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black's only saving move.
30,0,30,2Bf4,b'r3r3/ppp2p1k/4bpn1/8/3Q1B2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Ok I figure I will now regroup and finish him off. I have an overwhelming material advantage that should carry the day.
31,0,31,2Nxf4,b'r3r3/ppp2p1k/4bp2/8/3Q1n2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?! Just makes my job easier. I was frankly very surprised that my opponent would instigate any exchanges right now.
32,0,32,Kg7,b'r3r3/ppp2pk1/4bp2/8/5Q2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',? Black's Ra8 must get developed for black to have any chance. I felt that 23...Kg7 was a time waster.
33,0,33,2Qxc7,b'r3r3/ppQ2pk1/4bp2/8/8/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Just to ensure pawn equality on the queenside just in case. I can always play Qg3  next.
34,0,34,2b6,b'r3r3/p1Q2pk1/1p2bp2/8/8/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Protecting his b pawn.
35,0,35,2O-O,b'r3r3/p1Q2pk1/1p2bp2/8/8/P1P1P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Ok we'll do this the long way. I simply castle to get another gun into the fight.
36,0,36,2Rac8,b'2r1r3/p1Q2pk1/1p2bp2/8/8/P1P1P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',With an eye on my c pawn.
37,0,37,2Qg3+,b'2r1r3/p4pk1/1p2bp2/8/8/P1P1P1Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Sorry my c pawn is safe as well. Deal with this check first:)
38,0,38,Red8,b'2rr1k2/p4p2/1p2bp2/8/8/P1P1P1Q1/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Black is going to have to get vertical to stand a chance. Another time waster.
39,0,39,2c4,b'2rr1k2/p4p2/1p2bp2/8/2P5/P3P1Q1/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',!? A cute little tactic. 
40,0,40,2Bxc4,b'2rr1k2/p4p2/1p3p2/8/2b5/P3P1Q1/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',"Black takes the ""free"" pawn and is rewarded by..........."
41,0,41,2Qf4,b'2rr1k2/p4p2/1p3p2/8/2b2Q2/P3P3/5PPP/R1R3K1 b - -',! Hitting the enemy bishop for a second time but more importantly hitting f6. White can raise some serious you know what if the queen gets to f6.
42,0,42,2Be6,b'2rr1k2/p4p2/1p2bp2/8/5Q2/P3P3/5PPP/R1R3K1 w - -',Protecting his bishop but allowing further simplification.
43,0,43,3Qxf6,b'2r2k2/p4p2/1p2bQ2/8/8/P3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',Threatening Qh8  Ke7 QxR BxQ and an easy endgame for white.
44,0,44,3Rc7,b'5k2/p1r2p2/1p2bQ2/8/8/P3P3/5PPP/R5K1 w - -',I dont give black a ? for this move because at this stage they are all bad.
45,0,45,3Qd8+,b'3Q1k2/p1r2p2/1p2b3/8/8/P3P3/5PPP/R5K1 b - -',And black graciously resigned. I hope you have enjoyed it:) - Thomas

50,1,4,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/1bP2Bn1/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now jatayu is stunned that this is working.
51,1,5,Nd3#,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/8/1PP2B2/3n1N2/1P1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',jatayu just got the message Game Won Congratulations.
52,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is my first mini-tournament I have played on Gameknot. I wanted to choose a thematic one to try out new openings instead of my standard king pawn opening...

Real play doesn't start after 6. h4"
53,2,1,h4,b'rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq h3',Here is the start of the theme named French defence - Alekhine-Chatard.
54,2,2,Bxg5,b'rnbqk2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1b1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',There is the book way and the greedy-pawn-grabber way. I choose the greedy-pawn-grabber way and got hammered badly as you will see.
55,2,3,hxg5,b'rnbqk2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1P1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White retakes and opens up a lane for the rook at h-file.
56,2,4,Qxg5,b'rnb1k2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1q1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Here comes the greedy queen. To my defense I must say that I choose to be greedy just to see if I could get away with it. This was the fourth game in the tournament and I had lots of more games to play so I wanted to find out if this line was any good. It's not any good ;-)
57,2,5,Qd3,b'rnb1k2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1q1/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq -',White has a smart Queen. She develops with a threat. It took me a while to see Rxh7 (or to be truthful I only saw it after consulting the online DB...).
58,2,6,h6,b'rnb1k2r/pppn1pp1/4p2p/3pP1q1/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PP1/R3KBNR w KQkq -',The easiest response. But I should have considered Qg7 trying to remove whites best offensive weapon but at the time I just whipped out the pawn.
59,2,7,Nh3,b'rnb1k2r/pppn1pp1/4p2p/3pP1q1/3P4/2NQ3N/PPP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Developing with threat. Bringing another attacker on to the king side.
60,2,8,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqpp1/4p2p/3pP3/3P4/2NQ3N/PPP2PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',White has four pieces developed. Three of them aimed at the king side and can castle long at any given time. Black has two pieces barely developed and is no where close to castle to safety (i.e. queen side).
61,2,9,1Qg3,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqpp1/4p2p/3pP3/3P4/2N3QN/PPP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Threating again and moving aside so another piece can join the attack.

63,2,11,1Bd3,b'rnb1k2r/pppnqp2/4p1pp/3pP3/3P4/2NB2QN/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Look who took the queens place. The white bishop. Now white has five against two. What a bully ;-)
64,2,12,1Nf8,b'rnb1kn1r/ppp1qp2/4p1pp/3pP3/3P4/2NB2QN/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',"Here I am afraid of a sac on g6 attacking the king which is still in the middle. But the text isolates my own rook at h8. This is an important feature keep it in mind. 

The text move is lousy. I know... At this point I should have given up the defense of the g-pawn and started running the other way with my king (i.e. queen side)."
65,2,13,1Nf4,b'rnb1kn1r/ppp1qp2/4p1pp/3pP3/3P1N2/2NB2Q1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',Three guys hitting g6 and I start to get seriously worried.
66,2,14,1f5,b'rnb1kn1r/ppp1q3/4p1pp/3pPp2/3P1N2/2NB2Q1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq f6',Hit back (I was thinking at the time) expecting exf e.p. and when I retake with my queen she is closer to the action.

68,2,16,1Qxf6,b'rnb1kn1r/ppp5/4pqpp/3p4/3P1N2/2NB2Q1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',And now my queen acts as a defender and is not only a passive bystander.
69,2,17,1O-O-O,b'rnb1kn1r/ppp5/4pqpp/3p4/3P1N2/2NB2Q1/PPP2PP1/2KR3R b kq -',White castles to safety and develops another piece. That half open e-file with the backward pawn looks very tempting... Black is still nowhere close castling. Any votes for a short castle? No? I didn't think so ;-)
70,2,18,1Nc6,b'r1b1kn1r/ppp5/2n1pqpp/3p4/3P1N2/2NB2Q1/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w kq -',Usually you should try to move c5 before the knight but I wanted to castle badly!

Scroll down for a hint:
There are two key squares in the position: c7 and d6. If white could get the queen to c7 he would mate in two with Qxc7  Ke8 and Nd6#."

89,3,1,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',the closed Italian system. I think it gives no advantage to white.

116,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',But for a moment just forget about Hollywood and follow my analysis. What makes e4 special as the 1st move: it opens the diagonals of both the White bishop (f1-a6) and the White queen (d1-h5). The five most popular moves in chess history are (in this order): e4 d4 Nf3 c4 and g3. 
117,4,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The French Defence (e6). Grand Masters nowadays tend to prefer c5 and e5. However e6 is quite popular at all levels and I personally play it often as Black (but not always). Mikhail Botvinnik a former world champion played both c5 and e6 as Black against e4. He was successful with both because he studied the openings deeply and was a great strategist.
118,4,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',An alternative to the normal d4 is to play 2. Nf3 if White is not familiar with the French Defense. If Black plays c5 against Nf3 the game switches to the Sicilian Defense. If Black answers with Nf3 with d5 the game may continue 3. exd5 exd5. This would result in a similar initial position as what will happen in this game. This is known as the Exchange Variation.
119,4,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',It does not make sense to play anything other than d5 except in order to surprise the opponent and to hope that he will make errors. It is still possible to transpose to other openings. If Black decides to play the Owen's Defense he would play 2. ... b6 instead of d5. Then White will usually play 3. Nc3 Bd3 or Nf3 after which Black would continue 3. ... Bb7.
120,4,4,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White chooses the Exchange Variation usually for two reasons. First to prevent semi-closed French Defense positions with counter-attacks and to reach a simpler position especially if his opponent may know a lot about French positions. The second reason is because White gets to be on the move in a symmetrical position and may have a good attack if he plays well.
121,4,5,exd5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The natural move opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop. If Black takes the pawn with the queen he will have to either lose a tempo by moving the queen again because she will be targeted or lose the bishop pair by pinning the knight with his bishop and then exchanging. 3. ... Qxd5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Nf3 ... White would easily develop castle and refute the pin. 
122,4,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Limbos played Nc3. The alternatives are more popular (Nf3 Bd3 and c4). Nc3 Nf3 and Bd3 do not preclude each other; it is possible to play these in a different order on the 4th 5th and 6th moves. c4 is also strong but leads to different positions: (A) 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 ... or (B) 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 c6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. c5 ...
123,4,7,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The main alternative is Nf6. Bogart was a strong player - he played optimal moves until his 9th move as we will see. Bogart played Bb4 before playing Nf6. This way he still reserved the option to play Ne7 instead of Nf6 depending on White's next move. 
124,4,8,Bd3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',With this move (Bd3) we know that Limbos was thinking of a kingside attack. The target (focal point) is the h7 square. 5. ... Nc6 is a popular response to Bd3 because it gains a tempo by attacking the pawn on d4. However against Nc6 White can play: 6. a3 Bxc3 7. bxc3 ... and the d4 pawn becomes safe so Black would need a new plan such as Nc6-Na5-Nc4.
125,4,9,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',Between Nf6 or Ne7 Bogart had to choose Nf6 because it protects the h7 square better. There are other White moves against which Ne7 would be a good response: (A) 5. Qe2 Ne7! (B) 5. Qf3 Ne7 or (C) 5. Bd2 Ne7. Either way in this opening Black is able to develop just as quickly and will castle soon. 
126,4,10,Nge2,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',The main objective of this move is for the knight to facilitate a kingside attack after Black castles: Ne2-Ng3-Nf4 or Ne2-Ng3-Nh4. By going to g3 the knight will open the queen's diagonal and the queen will also attack the Black kingside. If White played Nf3 then after both sides castle Bg4 can pin the knight and it would be more difficult to create a kingside attack.
127,4,11,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',0-0 is theoretically good. If Black is a good defender it is OK to castle short in this opening. If you do not trust your defensive skills playing h6 before you castle  is an alternative because it prevents White from playing Bg5. 
128,4,12,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',After Black castles it is quite normal for him to play Re8 later in this opening to control the e-file. Obviously the White king would not stay in this open file and tie the knight on e2 for the defense. The White king goes to safety by castling.
129,4,13,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',With this move Black may organize his own attack against h2 if he can manage to put his bishop and queen on c7 and d6. Many modern-day French Defense players (including myself) make this move (c6) earlier on the 4th 5th or 6th move. Then Black can develop the bishop to d6 in one move instead of going to b4 first and then back to d6.
130,4,14,Bg5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Bg5 pins the defending knight. This pin is unpleasent because if White can double the f-pawns by capturing the knight this would weaken Black's kingside. This limits the current mobility of Black's pieces because he may have to protect the knight with another piece (queen bishop or knight).
131,4,15,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This move protects the knight once more and frees the queen to move out of the pin. Its disadvantage is that it blocks the bishop on c8. On the other hand the bishop can become normally free if Bogart plays consistently and moves h6 at the right time: 9. Ng3 h6! 10. Bf4 Nb6
132,4,16,Ng3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NB2N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',As I explained earlier the White queen's diagonal is now open for the kingside attack. The knight is ready to go to either f4 or h4. 
133,4,17,Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NB2N1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',h6 would have been better here. With the knight on g3 White would no longer be able to play Bh4 after h6 (because of g5 trapping the bishop) and would have to retreat to f4 or e3. Another possibility would be Re8 putting the rook on an open file before White does that with Re1.
134,4,18,1Nh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/2p2n2/3p2BN/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Threatening to weaken the Black kingside: Nxf6 Nxf6 Bxf6 gxf6 doubling the pawns... Black must be careful here and defend well. 
135,4,19,1Nxh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/2p5/3p2Bn/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',This move will allow White to bring the queen to h5. 10. ... Nxh5 is a normal move as long as Bogart can play the correct continuation next. 10. ... Be7 is too passive because of 11. Re1 will attack the bishop forcing Black to play Qd8 or Bd8.
136,4,20,1Qxh5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1ppp/2p5/3p2BQ/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',White's plan has been achieved. There are two bishops and a queen ready for a kingside attack. There is a simple mate threat here on h7. Black has to slightly weaken the kingside squares to stop the mate but he should not have any big problems. It is actually the psychological effect of being under attack which may cause Black to make an error later.
137,4,21,1g6,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1p1p/2p3p1/3p2BQ/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',There were two choices here: f5 and g6. Bogart (who had played well up until now) chose the weaker one (g6) and then he also played f5 on his 12th move. Just one move was all that he needed (11. ... f5!). g6 weakens the black squares and makes it possible for White to put his bishop and queen on black squares near the king (f6 and h6).  
138,4,22,1Qh6,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn1p1p/2p3pQ/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This move limits Black's options. Black wants to be able to play Nb6 in the future to develop the other bishop on c8. In this position he cannot do so: 12. ... Nb6?? Bf6 followed by mate. 
139,4,23,1f5,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn3p/2p3pQ/3p1pB1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - f6',After f5 Black is surviving and can play the knight to Nf6 or Nb6. 
140,4,24,1Rfe1,b'r1b2rk1/ppqn3p/2p3pQ/3p1pB1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White's new attacking plan: Rf1-Re1-Re7. He cannot mate using the bishops but if he can manage to bring a rook to e7 then he may be able to mate on g7 or h7.
141,4,25,1Nb6,b'r1b2rk1/ppq4p/1np3pQ/3p1pB1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black had two choices: Nb6 or Nf6. It is not difficult to see why Nf6 would have been better. First it would have blocked the white bishop's diagonal g5-e7. Second Nf6 might be able to jump to the e4 square for a counter attack. 
142,4,26,1Re2,b'r1b2rk1/ppq4p/1np3pQ/3p1pB1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1RPPP/R5K1 b - -',Remember the plan was to put a rook on e7. Currently the e7 square is attacked twice with the White rook (e2) and the bishop (g5) but it is also defended twice: with the Black queen (c7) and the bishop (b4). Therefore in order to seize that square White must bring a 3rd attacker - the other rook. He may double the rooks with Rae1 next.
143,4,27,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/ppqb3p/1np3pQ/3p1pB1/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1RPPP/R5K1 w - -',Black is too passive here and unable to develop the bishop to e6 because of the White rook on e2. By going to d7 the bishop unfortunately blocks the queen off from defending the kingside.  It is still better to leave the bishop on c8 so that the queen can control the 7th rank from c7-h7. Here Qf7 or Qg7 would have been better defensive moves.
144,4,28,1Be7,b'r4rk1/ppqbB2p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP1RPPP/R5K1 b - -',After Bd7 blocking his own queen White does not need the other rook for his plan. He plays Be7 right away forcing Black to exhange the bishops and bringing the rook to e7.
145,4,29,1Bxe7,b'r4rk1/ppqbb2p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP1RPPP/R5K1 w - -',Bogart is forced to move the bishop from b4 because it has no defender. By exchanging bishops he will allow Re7 and lose the h7 pawn. He will lose material anyways; he could have lost his material in a better way: 12. ... Bd6!? 13. Bxf8 Bxf8 ... (no more mate threat). He would be an exchange down but with the bishop pair he would draw the endgame.
146,4,30,1Rxe7,b'r4rk1/ppqbR2p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',White is now certainly better. The following few moves are all forced.
147,4,31,1Rf7,b'r5k1/ppqbRr1p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',Mate on g7 or h7 was threatened. Rf7 is the only way to stop it.
148,4,32,1Rxf7,b'r5k1/ppqb1R1p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',White will now exhange the rooks and win the h7 pawn.
149,4,33,1Kxf7,b'r7/ppqb1k1p/1np3pQ/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',The Black king is unfortunately moving out into the open and toward the middle of the board. 
150,4,34,1Qxh7+,b'r7/ppqb1k1Q/1np3p1/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - -',Finally Limbos wins material (a pawn) and threatens to win more (the g6 pawn). The important thing for White now is not to relax. He stands better and he must finish the game off before Black gets a chance.
151,4,35,1Kf6,b'r7/ppqb3Q/1np2kp1/3p1p2/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',"Obviously Bogart does not want to go to e8 or e6 because of Rae1 . Kf6 protects the g6 pawn but moves closer to the middle of the board where the king can be attacked also by the other White pieces.
Kf8 would not have been worse than Kf6. After 18. ... Kf8 19. Qxg6 Re8 and at least Bogart would complete his development."

154,4,38,2g4,b'r7/pp1b3Q/1npq1kp1/3p1p2/3P2P1/2NB4/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 b - g3',With this great move White is trying to destroy the pawn-cover (g6 & f5) around the Black king. Trying to attack the g6 pawn twice does not bring a quick win: 20. Re3 Be6 21. Rg3 Rg8.
155,4,39,2Rd8,b'3r4/pp1b3Q/1npq1kp1/3p1p2/3P2P1/2NB4/PPP2P1P/4R1K1 w - -',By now Bogart probably does not have any concentration and morale left. Of course he is losing but with Re8 would have been able to continue the game longer. Rd8? loses right away. Because Bogart cannot take on g4 (Qxg6 mate) Limbos is planning f4 followed by g5# or h4 followed by g5#.

Nevertheless it is mate for sure in less than 10 moves. Limbos will play 22. h4 but 22. Bxf5 would also work. In my next & last paragraph I will summarize the lessons learned after this game.

268,7,85,5Kf4,b'8/8/5k2/7R/5K2/5Br1/8/8 b - -',An important move!  Black thinks he'll be okay with Rg1 keeping the option to interpose on g6 open but I've calculated further...
269,7,86,5Be2,b'8/8/5k2/7R/5K2/8/4B3/6r1 b - -',!  This assures white of pushing black back to the 7th rank!
270,7,87,Kg7,b'8/6k1/7R/8/5K2/8/4B3/4r3 w - -',It looks like white must abandon the idea of a rook on the 6th rank now but there's a sequence that allows me to keep it there...
271,7,88,6Kf5,b'8/5k2/4R3/5K2/8/8/4B3/4r3 b - -',And now the bishop is free to move.  Bh5  is threatened now.

274,7,91,6Kg5,b'8/4k3/5r2/R5K1/4B3/8/8/8 b - -',The only way out of the checks.
275,7,92,7Kd4,b'8/8/3k4/R7/3K2B1/8/8/4r3 b - -',Finally he can't check me any longer!
276,7,93,7Rg1,b'8/8/3k4/R7/3K2B1/8/8/6r1 w - -',?  Black had discovered the drawing strategy of allowing his rook to get between his king and my rook; so Rc1 was the move here; this pushes his king towards the back rank again.
277,7,94,Rd1,b'8/4k3/R7/4K3/4B3/8/8/3r4 w - -',This time he remembered.  I figure I have to do something about this differently since Ra7  will get me nowhere.  So I calculated a while and came up with...
278,7,95,7Re6+,b'8/4k3/4R3/4K3/4B3/8/8/3r4 b - -',!  This forces the king out of the center or towards the back; since Kd7 is met with Rh6!
279,7,96,7Kd8,b'3k4/8/4R3/4K3/4B3/8/8/3r4 w - -',I thought Kf7 was more tenacious.

( If the White Bishop comes to e2 known as the classical system then Black should exchange Knights and then play Be6!  yes to e6.)  Then play Rc8 and then bring the Queen out to a5 and then go for Ne5-c4 then later on a possible exchange sacrifice with Rxc3. and h5 to stop White from playing h2-h4-h5 and g4.

This game teaches an important lesson that every pawn your opponent makes has the potential to leave a gaping hole in their defence allowing you to slip right past their defenders.

Black's kingside is severely weakened and suddenly castling seems a lot less safe. Moves like h4 and g4 seeking to pry open files on the kingside are suddenly in the offing after White castles queenside.

There Alburt pointed out that I could have repeatedly gotten an advantage by playing the e5 pawn push because my opponent had allowed it. He said that this move is thematic in this opening and that White should play it. I wasted no time seeing that Black's knight doesn't really have any good squares.
526,19,5,Ng8,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pnppb1/1p1p2p1/4P2p/3P4/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1BNR w kq -',Maybe h7 would have been a better square for the knight seeking to castle.

I didn't want Black moving his knight to f8 to defend the e6 pawn and to subsequently start pushing his center pawns. No doubt that would have been very weakening but I don't like being material down and I was most interested in trying to regain my pawn by aiming my forces at g6. Thus this pin.
529,19,8,1Nh3,b'r2q2nr/pbpnpkb1/1p1pp1p1/1B5p/3P4/2NQBP1N/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',This is a better launching point for the knight than e2 because of the move ...e5 which robs the knight of the f4 square. Here the knight can also go to g5.

531,19,10,Ke8,b'r3k1nr/pbpqp3/1p1ppbp1/7p/3P1N2/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',This gives up the pawn without a fight. Since Black ends up sacrificing the exchange with Rh6 the next move anyway if he was going to do this this move would probably have been a much better time to do so because it is not so easy to win an exchange that way seeing that White's knight cannot safely advance any further.
532,19,11,1Nxg6,b'r3k1nr/pbpqp3/1p1ppbN1/7p/3P4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',Some of my friends thought that I should have captured with the Queen instead but I would rather win the Exchange here than have my Queen deep in the position and worry about getting it trapped.
533,19,12,Nxh6,b'r3k3/pbpqp3/1p1ppbNn/7p/3P4/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - -',My next plan was to get this knight out. In retrospect perhaps it was unnecessary to do so as it was very strong in its position. Still 17.Nf4 looks very good here. However I was sidetracked by a cheap trap that I tried setting.
534,19,13,1Nh8,b'r3k2N/pbpqp3/1p1ppb1n/7p/3P4/2NQ1P2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - -',This is a bad move because of my opponent's excellent follow up. Obviously I had been hoping for 17...Bxh8?? 18. Qg6  and if 18...Nf7?? 19.Qg8#. It's tempting to try to cash in quickly after winning material but it's not that simple here. Nf4 would have been a much better square for the knight.

It is worth mentioning that I started to realize that I was in the running for the tournament's prize money and that I started to get very stressed especially after a meltdown in a similar situation in the Reserve Section of last year's Missouri Open when I blundered a rook on Board 1 in a winning position costing myself $150.

The e2 square suits the bishop where it can eye both sides of the board -- developing to c4 or d3 restricts its mobility given the position of the black pawns.

I don't think white can stop my dark squared bishop from shuttling to and from d6 and f4).  I therefore offered my opponent a draw and he accepted.

If White plays a3 stopping me from completing my pawn chain then it will take me a lot longer to make progress on the queenside. I will have to complete development with Bd7 and try maneuvering my kingside knight to the queenside with Ne8-c7-b5

1049,36,12,2Nc6,b'2b2rk1/4ppbp/r1N3p1/8/3p1P2/3P2P1/P5BP/R4RK1 b - -',White has a lot of advantages in this middlegame/endgame. He has a strong passed a-pawn while I have a weak backward e-pawn. White's isolated d-pawn seems to have enough potential defenders. I should be lucky to draw this ending but I swindled him at the end because of my superior endgame calculation.

My fianchettoed bishop has been weakened because of my badly placed d-pawn. My d-pawn would be stronger on d5 supported by e6 but unfortunately pawns cannot move backwards

It seems as if I am successfully containing the pawn so I was sure that I could draw this and maybe win if my opponent screws up
1057,36,20,Kc6,b'8/r6p/P1k1p1p1/2b2p2/3p1PP1/3P1K2/2N4P/R7 w - -',I ignore White's dubious pawn advance and head toward White's passed pawn. Now that White realizes he will lose his passed pawn he has to threaten my pawn.
1058,36,21,Kc6,b'8/7p/r1k5/2b1Rp2/3p1P2/3P1K2/2N4P/8 w - -',Here If White takes f5 then Ra2 followed by Rxh2 and it seems like that variation gives White the best winning chances rather than the variation he played which is drawn but I managed to outplay him based on his miscalculation
1059,36,22,Ra1,b'8/7p/2k5/2b1Rp2/3p1P2/3P2K1/7P/r3N3 w - -',Here I was thinking I should just repeat moves since White seems to have better winning chances but White didn't want to and instead went into an ending where I am better
1060,36,23,4Re2,b'8/7p/2k5/2b2p2/3p1P2/3P4/r3RK1P/4N3 b - -',This is a blunder. White maybe thought his knight would be better than my bishop because it can attack my light-squared f-pawn but bishops are almost always better than knights in dynamic endgames like this. but this is probably still drawn White just severely decreased his winning chances with the rook trade
1061,36,24,Be7,b'8/4b2p/8/3k1p2/3p1P2/3P4/5K1P/4N3 w - -',Here I want to restrict White's knight from coming to g5 or h4. Another good thing about bishops is that they can waste moves and still attack the same diagonal unlike knights which cannot control the same squares when they move.
1062,36,25,Bf6,b'8/8/5b1p/3k1p2/3p1P2/3P1NK1/7P/8 w - -',Here it seems like the ending is pretty much drawn. White can safeguard his f-pawn with his king and later his knight and I cannot breakthrough at all.

White's losing plan is to defend his d-pawn with his king where I can simply waste moves until White is in zugswang and must move his king away from defending his pawn

54.Kg7?? is also losing.
54.Kg6 is White's only drawing move (you'll see after the pawns promote)
If White had calculated thoroughly then he would've seen that Kg5 is losing. White probably only calculated that his pawn promotes right after mine does so he thought he would have an easy draw in the resulting queen ending and that it didn't matter where his king was. After the pawn race you'll see why Kg6 was the only drawing move"
1066,36,29,5h8=Q,b'7Q/8/8/5pK1/4kP2/8/8/3q4 b - -',This position is lost for White because after Qg1  White's king is forced to the h-file since Kf6 loses to Qd4  skewer. After the king moves to the h-file I have Qh1  skewer forcing a queen trade then my king just takes f4-pawn and I promote the last pawn and win. If White's king was on g6 then I wouldn't be able to force a queen trade and the ending is drawn. If White's king had moved to g7 then Qa1  forces a queen trade.
1067,36,30,Qxh8+,b'7q/6K1/8/5p2/4kP2/8/8/8 w - -',White resigned I win easily after taking White's pawn and White's king is not in a position to interfere with my promotion. If White's king was in front of my pawn like around f1 then it would be a draw.

1150,38,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Scotch Gambit
1151,38,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',While MCO recommends this move white wins his pawn back with the moves that occur and white gets a better position.
1152,38,2,Kf8,b'r1bq1knr/pppp2pp/2n5/2bQ4/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',A better move is 7 ... Ke8 to prevent white from taking the bishop with check.
1153,38,3,Kf7,b'r1bq3r/ppp2kpp/2np1n2/8/4P3/2Q2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Either trying to artificial castle or develop the rook. Or maybe both.
1154,38,4,Be6,b'r2q3r/ppp2kpp/2npbn2/8/4P3/2Q2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',This move is somwhat hindering the development of black's rook.  11...Re8 would have been better.
1155,38,5,1f4,b'r2qrk2/ppp3pp/2npbn2/6N1/4PP2/2Q5/PP1N2PP/R1B1R1K1 b - f3',Still looking to crash into black's position I decide to attack rather than trade my knight for his bishop.
1156,38,6,Nd7,b'r2qrkb1/pppn2pp/2np4/4P1N1/5P2/2Q5/PP1N2PP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',Black has to switch to defense now since white is advancing over the equator too much for black's liking.

1158,38,8,1Nd8,b'r2nrkb1/pppnq1pp/3p4/4P1N1/2N2P2/1PQ5/P5PP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',What is black trying to do? Get smothers mated?
1159,38,9,1Bb2,b'r2nrkb1/pppnq1pp/3p4/4P1N1/2N2P2/1PQ5/PB4PP/R3R1K1 b - -',Adding a defender to e5 and also forming a battery on the a1-h8 diagonal threatening checkmate if the queen moves away.
1160,38,10,1exd6,b'r3rkb1/pppnq1pp/3Pn3/6N1/2N2P2/1PQ5/PB4PP/R3R1K1 b - -',I thought for a while about this move.  This was hard because after making the move I had 4 minutes on my clock.  
1161,38,11,2Nxd6,b'r3rkb1/pp1nq1pp/3Nn3/6N1/5P2/1PQ5/PB4PP/R3R1K1 b - -',20...Qxd6?? loses to 21 Nxe6 Rxe6 22 Qxg7  Ke8  with mate coming in a few moves.  The correct move for me was 20 Nxe6 and after 20...Bxe6 21 Rxe6 Qf7 22 Nxd6 and either the queen dies or black gets checkmated.  I did not see this because I has to play fast in time pressure.
1162,38,12,2Nf6,b'r3rkb1/pp2q1pp/3Nnn2/6N1/5P2/1PQ5/PB4PP/R3R1K1 w - -',Blocking the checkmate
1163,38,13,2f5,b'4rk2/pp2q1pp/4bn2/5P2/8/1PQ5/PB4PP/R3R1K1 b - -',At this point in the game I am up the exchange and soon a bishop. Even though I have about 2:30 on my clock I have a 5 second delay and I usually get low on time.  If I don't blunder my queen this game is won.
1164,38,14,2Re1,b'5k2/pp4pp/4qn2/8/8/1PQ5/PB4PP/4R1K1 b - -',Even with three pieces the king can still be attacked.
1165,38,15,2Qf7,b'5k2/pp3qpp/5n2/8/8/1PQ5/PB4PP/4R1K1 w - -',This move is not good for black since it blocks the king's only escape square.  Black will probably have to sac his queen now.  My opponent was a very fast mover and still had about 20 minutes on his clock.
1166,38,16,2Ba3+,b'2Q1nk2/pp3qpp/8/8/8/BP6/P5PP/4R1K1 b - -',The game winning move.
1167,38,17,3Qxe8#,b'4Q1k1/pp4pp/8/8/8/BP6/P5PP/6K1 b - -',My opponent appeared to have played a lot of blitz and played very fast the whole game and missed a lot of tactics.  With me the last tournament I had played in was the washington open.  A G30 compared to that is like a blitz game.  Even though I ran low on time I stopped to think about my moves and led a great attack the whole game.
1168,39,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',A blitz game I memorized. (played on gameknot)
1169,39,1,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2...d5 would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4.
1170,39,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',One of the key elements of the Nimzo-Indian is the bishop on b4.
1171,39,3,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',And now one of the most straightforward replies is the Rubinstein Variation (4.e3) in which White ignores Black's 'threats' and simply gets on with the process of developing his remaining pieces.
1172,39,4,c5,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',Basically one of the three main options for Black here. The other two are 4...b6 and 4...O-O.
1173,39,5,Nge2,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',This is a very common move in the Nimzo-Indian. Another possibility is 5.Bd3 with for instance the so called H�bner Variation 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Bxc3  7.bxc3 d6 8.O-O etc.
1174,39,6,Ne4,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/1bPPn3/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',5...cxd4 is more common here. The text-move caught me a bit off guard.

1177,39,9,Qc2,b'rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/b1p5/2PPn3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Developing my queen and attacking the knight on e4.

1184,39,16,1Qxf2+,b'rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/8/b1Pp4/1P2n3/P1N1P3/2Q1NqPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',That's what can happen in a blitz game late at night :)

(attacking both the knight and bishop) 12...Bf5 13.Nxc7  Ke7 14.Nd5  (14.Nxa8? is not so good: 14...Rd8  15.Bd2 Qxe3) 14...Kf8 15.Ndc3 and white comes out a a bishop and a pawn ahead.
1187,39,19,1Qxe4+,b'rnb1k2r/ppb2ppp/8/2P5/1P2Q3/P3P3/4NqPP/R1BK1B1R b kq -',At least I'm winning a pawn again and now the black king is in an ugly position.
1188,39,20,1Be6,b'rn2k2r/ppb2ppp/4b3/2P5/1P2Q3/P3P3/4NqPP/R1BK1B1R w kq -',?? This move spells disaster for Black. 13...Kf8 14.Nd4 Nc6 and white is better of course.

He could have tried 14...Be5 where white has to be really careful: 15.Kc2 (forced) 15...Bxa1 16.Qxa8 Bf5  17.Kd1 0-0 but this leaves black two pawns behind and something like 18.Qf3 wins for white. Time left on the clock -  White: 8:08 - Black:7:56
