1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I usually refute d4 by Nf6 this is my psywar against white he doesn't know what is my idea on my opening because I can transpose this to any openings unlike d5.
2,0,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',white continue pushing his pawn to c4. 
3,0,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Here is my idea like my idol Fischer likes the Kings Indian Defense But I only bluff white since I decide to play my opening repertoire the Gruenfeld defense.

21,0,21,Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2p1b1/n1p3pp/3n4/3PN3/1P1QBNPP/P4PB1/3R1RK1 w - -',I played Nd5 to centralize my knight. I can play Bf5 but it will eject only by g4. I'm still looking the possibilities to capture h3 pawn
22,0,22,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2p1b1/2p3pp/3n4/1n1PN2N/1P2B1PP/P2Q1PB1/3R1RK1 b - -',I thought white will play Qb1 to add pressure on g6 square but he's looking the h6 pawn.

25,0,25,2Qe8,b'r1b1qr2/pp2p1bk/n1p3pp/3n4/3PN2N/PP1QB1PP/5PB1/3R1RK1 w - -',Instead of 21...Qe8 I can play here 21... Bf5 but I'm hesitate since after white's 22.g4 my move is  22..Bxe4 followed by white move's 23. Bxe4 and naturally my reply should be 23..Rf6.which gives me uncomfortable position

33,0,33,2Rfe1,b'3rqr2/pp2p1bk/n1p4p/3nNp2/3P4/PP2B1PP/3Q1PB1/3RR1K1 b - -',white is eyeing my weakness in e file

43,0,43,3Qc2+,b'3r2r1/pB2p2k/Q6p/4Pp2/3n4/P2R2PP/2q4K/4R3 w - -',white probably overlook this move..

67,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The King's Pawn Opening.
68,2,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As usual I respond with the Siclian Defense.
69,2,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is ok but I would have played 2.Nf3 for the Open Sicilian.  However this is not going to be an Open variation but it will become the Morra Gambit.  Now I also know how to handle this variation.
70,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',There is one drawback however.  This gambit involves capturing with the Queen so I decide to drive it away while developing.  Right now everything looks good but I will stop developing and resort to unsound aggression momentarily.
71,2,4,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',At this point I want to develop my DSB and transpose the Morra Gambit into the French Defense.  That is why I played this. 
72,2,5,Qf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',I do not know why he moved there but this is where I start my unsound aggression tactic.  How will I do this?  
73,2,6,Nb4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1n2P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',That's how.  Like my last game against blitzkov I want to win his a1 rook and take away his opportunity to castle in one move.  In this position his only options are 6.Bd3.  However if 6.Qd3?? 6...Nxd3 winning his Queen and the game.  This time however my plan will work because he will not play 6.Bd3.  Therefore he allows me to take his c2 pawn and a1 rook.  In addition it is no longer feasible to castle.  As a result I am now in favor to win this game.  Note: I am not saying that this is his loosing blunder.
74,2,7,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR b kq -',Now he decides to develop his knight but his center is destroyed.  In other words he cannot control the center any longer because his rook is gone.  Note: To control the center both of your rooks have to be connected.  Although I can control the center I will not bother because I will come up with other ways to defeat him.
75,2,8,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1bB1P3/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR w kq -',I decide to his knight.  Although it is not pinned his c3 knight is almost trapped.  In this position his knight can only be saved with 8...Ne2.  However he does not play this so I will take with 9...exd5.  BTW I wanted to put him in this situation and that is why I played this.  Having said that 9.Nd5 will be his loosing blunder.  Note: my goal is to chase his knight away so that I can mate him.  Why does 9.Nd5?? loose and how will I mate him?
76,2,9,1Bxd5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/3B4/1b2P3/5Q2/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR b kq -',That is the answer.  Now that his Knight and LSB are away from the c file I try to mate him quickly.  What is my plan?  
77,2,10,1Qc7,b'r1b1k1nr/ppqp1ppp/8/3B4/1b2P3/5Q2/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR w kq -',!! This is it.  If he is not careful 11...Qc2# mating him in one.  I know that he will spot this threat so why did I play this?  Even if I cannot mate in one I will eventually mate sooner or later.  It might take a long time but I will find a way to mate him with my Queen and Knight.  BTW that is why 9.Nd5?? was his decisive mistake and the loosing blunder.  In addition that is also why this move deserves two exclamation points.  Note: A !! move=an extraordinarily brilliant even if it takes a long time.  It is not reserved for a really solid move that does not have long lasting effects.  This time however my plan is inevitable.  I was very scrupulous with this position and did a lot of HW to come up with this plan.
78,2,11,1Qxf7+,b'r1b1k1nr/ppqp1Qpp/8/3B4/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR b kq -',! He discovers my plan so he decides to place me in check.  What does this accomplish?  In this position I have lost my opportunity to castle.  I normally make a big deal about this but I no longer care about the center.  Why?  I know that is a matter of time before I mate him even if it takes a long time.  In fact he will continue with perpetual checks because he thinks that he will mate in one.  However this is not going to happen.  Instead I will stick to my plans because I know that it will lead to mate.
79,2,12,1Bg5+,b'r1bk2nr/ppqp1Qpp/8/3B2B1/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR b - -',Now he thinks that he has won.  In fact he believes that it is mate in one.  Why?  12...Nf6 or 12...Ne7 are my only options so he figures 13.Qe7#.  However 13.Qe7+?? does not mate.  Instead 13...Bxe7 so he looses his Queen and the game immediately.  He knows this so he decides to play 13.Bxf6+.
80,2,13,1Nf6,b'r1bk3r/ppqp1Qpp/5n2/3B2B1/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR w - -',As noted earlier I could have responded with Ne7 but this is best.  If 12...Ne7 13.Bxe7+ Bxe7 14.Qxg7 so he gets a pawn back.
81,2,14,gxf6,b'r1bk3r/ppqp1Q1p/5p2/3B4/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR w - -',This move is forced but I do not mind.  Why?  In this position I won his dominant bishop.
82,2,15,1Qxf6+,b'r1bk3r/ppqp3p/5Q2/3B4/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR b - -',This is a serious because it forks my King and h8 rook.  After I get out of check he will win the rook.  However I am not going to give up because I know that I will still defeat him sooner or later.  This is a similar situation to my last game against blitzkov because the game was lost but I decided to continue because I thought that I had a chance to win.  This time however I know that I am going to do that but I am not going to underestimate.  Why?  Being overconfident will cost me the game.
83,2,16,Ke7,b'r1b4Q/ppqpk2p/8/3B4/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR w - -',Also forced.  This time however it is a problem because my King is exposed and it is now more open then his King.  However I am not going to give up because I know his weak spot and that is why I am going to mate as I had noted earlier.
84,2,17,1Qxh7+,b'r1b5/ppqpk2Q/8/3B4/1b2P3/8/PP3PPP/n2K2NR b - -',He wins a pawn with this check but I know that there is a way out of this.  However I cannot do this with 16...Kf8 or 17.Qg8# mating me in one.  BTW I am familiar with this type of mating threat because it is a similar Scenario to SM (Scholar's Mate).

Normally I would not think about a plan in my games but just make the best moves one by one. But in this situation there are not any specific correct moves but many.

We should not play on the kingside because it is also blocked off with no real target. On the queenside black has weak pawn on c5. Therefore we should attack there at the pawn. With the queen we don't know what it should do. Perhaps after the other pieces move it can go onto f2-at least it will be flexible right now. Our c3 knight goes to a4 and Ba3. The c4 advance needs to be made impossible by playing the move of b3 and c4 to fix the weaknesses. The f3 knights will later go to d2 to prevent ...d4. Our rooks can wait. We should exchange nothing at the moment although an endgame suits us better as the bishops are useless.

Although true :( this doesn't help you in a real game. In a real game you need to treat your (human) opponent's plan as inferior to yours. The masters always strive to go with their ideas at all costs. When one player accepts that the opponent is equal or better than him in terms of ideas he usually cannot win. Even if unsound a master always goes with his plan in a straightforward manner. Planning and attack are really the same-The masters I communicate with refer to them as the same in a casual manner. If you cannot attack you cannot make a plan really. In that case you just need to improve pieces and create a weakness. Against weaker players and even colleagues the masters always care about their own ideas above all.

If you do a calculation of these certainly you may be leaning towards the move 24.b4. However it would be close and the right idea would be hard. According to the strategy of chess we should just do the piece move. Unfortunately I fell into the trap of caring about less important ideas- like my pawn majority and not allowing ...c5. As you see even one single move in which you think too much about useless things can hurt your decisions. Fortunately for me the move was enough to keep my big advantage at that level and I don't make mistakes of this nature too much. I was not really in a time trouble here at all.
113,3,17,2g3,b'7r/3bk2p/p1pNpp2/4P1p1/1PPr1P2/5RP1/P3K2P/R7 b - -',I think it is the best move and the only one which is good.
114,3,18,Be8,b'4b2r/4k2p/p1pNpp2/4P3/1PPr1P2/5R2/P3K2P/R7 w - -',Black is relying on tricks to get back into the game.

Now that I have more or less stabilized my pawns I can get on with the plan of pushing the passed pawns. It is really simple actually- If the opponent does not have an immediate threat just push the pawn first and think later. This also helps in time trouble if you get into it.
116,3,20,3Rf4,b'4b1r1/4k2p/p1pNp3/4P3/PPP2Rr1/4K3/7P/R7 b - -',Black did have a threat so white immediately neutralizes him.

You see my first round lasted a very long time since my opponent played a lost position(QvsR+others) very slowly as if the position stood any chance at all. When in a lost position and it is totally lost it is quite rude to take such a large amount of time looking for tricks(That time should have been used to avoid the lost position in the first place)-as opposed to a competitive or even worse position when taking time is totally reasonable. Anyways I was unable to take any rests and only had a very little time in between the games. The fatigue almost made me lose the game.

(again sacrificing the rook which is not important for the attack) White simply has too many threats to the Black monarch.

Qf3 is not as sharp and not well-explored; the computer doesn't give it a terrific evaluation but I think it's pretty reasonable since it takes the game into unexplored territory develops the queen early but to a reasonably stable place where it won't be harassed much and pretty much forces black to accept a distinct lag in development in exchange for that pawn.  A typical and plausible gambit idea.
257,7,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Black is thinking: Get as strong as possible in the center since white's given up a central pawn don't fall any further behind in development and don't start any conflicts or exchanges until the center is strong and king is safe.  And of course don't allow the game to end with an ignominious 5.  Qxf7.

The computer likes the odd-looking Na5 at this point which seems strategically hard to explain.
262,7,7,Qd7,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B3b1/2NPB1Q1/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',8...Qd7 doesn't seem so great but I think the ideas here were: (1) it makes O-O-O possible and (2) since the bishop on g4 can get forced to retreat in a variety of ways an exchange of bishops on e6 is a possibility and if that happens I'd like to make the recapture with the queen.  At least it's not demonstrably bad and consistent with black's strategic goals and I don't see anything really better.  I think black has to be patient here.

My instinct was to reply with 10...d5 and the computer says that's tactically the best thing here.  But the variations are complicated (well to me they are!) and I found a lot of pits that I could fall into; probably one of the reasons for O-O-O was that it does put the white rook on the same file as the black queen which has little room to move and pawn exchanges in the center could lead to a discovered attack.  Since I couldn't calculate the effect of ...d5 with certainty...
264,7,9,1Be7,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/2npbn2/4p3/2B5/2NPBPQ1/PPP1N1PP/2KR3R w kq -',I played quieter and stuck to my plan of avoiding conflicts until I had more security.  Black's pieces are cramped for the moment but there's the option of castling on either side and with good pawn advances the pieces should come alive. 
265,7,10,1Bb5,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/2npbn2/1B2p3/8/2NPBPQ1/PPP1N1PP/2KR3R b kq -',Pins the knight but more bark than bite to this move.
266,7,11,1Nh5,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/2npb3/1B2p2n/8/2NPBPQ1/PPP1N1PP/2KR3R w kq -',I thought a long time about the order of operations here.  The bishop on b5 can be pushed back with ...a6 and ...b5 which is clearly the right thing to do to it.  That means castling short is most attractive to black.  However 10...Be7 did leave the black g-pawn vulnerable to capture by the queen.  By itself that isn't a too-serious problem because it would be offset by a subsequent time-wasting (for white) retreat of the queen.  But pushing pawns on the queenside (hemming in the white bishop and advancing on white's castled position) means I would rather keep my pawns on the kingside intact.  Nh5 seemed the best way to get both a good kingside castled position and the queenside pawn advance.
267,7,12,O-O,b'r4rk1/2pqbppp/p1npb3/1p2p2n/8/1BNPBP2/PPP1NQPP/2KR3R w - -',This seems to realize black's strategic goals for the initial part of the game.  The position feels good especially the black rooks' access to the queenside.  Black can claim strength in the center and a queenside space advantage.  The worst thing is that knight on the h-file which is the most obvious thing to attack.

Black is also procrastinating the annoying question of what to do with his misplaced knight on the other side to be honest.

Qh4 ... g6 after which the knight is safe but useless.  So h4 was a gift! 
272,7,17,1d5,b'r4rk1/2pqbppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/6PP/1PNPBP2/PP2NQ2/2KR3R w - -',I'm tempted to mark this d5! just because it's long awaited and makes absolutely everything easier even though it doesn't start anything brilliant immediately.  It's well supported controls the center opens a line for the bishop opens d6 for the knight if it needs to find a place and will generally be a useful part of the planned queenside pawn advance.

The best thing might be countering with 20. a3 since the black knight on b4 is a pretty influential piece at the moment and exchanging it or forcing it to retreat might be the best white could get here.  The actual 20. Ne4 loses material and you can pause to think through the tactical possibilities here if you like.
277,7,22,f6,b'r4rk1/2pqb1pp/p4p2/1p2p1B1/1n1pP1PP/1P3P2/PP2NQ2/2KR3R w - -',It's 21...f6 that really punishes 20. Ne4.  The bishop can't retreat to d2 since that would once again allow the lethal ...Nd3 fork.  But there's no good option really and not much point hashing out which is the least worst alternative.
278,7,23,2Nxd4,b'r4rk1/2pqb1pp/p4p2/1p2p1B1/1n1NP1PP/1P3P2/PP3Q2/2KR3R b - -',This is arguably a good response in the situation because it creates a decision for black instead of an easy reply.

Capturing the bishop fxg5 wins more material than capturing the knight.  On the other hand the white bishop is not going to accomplish much even if it stays on the board and this move creates an advanced passed pawn which is going to be well-supported and gives black a straightforward plan for the rest of the game.  (That plan is:  Pawns.  Advance them.  And don't do anything stupid.)

It was a very satisfying win.  Commentary in hindsight makes it feel easy (especially at this point!) but white posed a lot of problems throughout the opening and middle and much of the play was guided by strategic concerns rather than tactical ones which are ""fuzzier"" and more difficult to evaluate (or so I find it).  I liked white's choice of 4. Qf3 and I think 17. g5 would have made black's game quite difficult so there's a lot of territory still to explore around this game.  "

White probably challenges my Knight with Nd2.  My opponent who likes daring moves would probably like me to sacrifice my Knight at f2 bring my Queen to h4 and start an attack.  White should be able to take the center pawns; so I'd be down only a pawn.

I will counterplay in the center with c5 ultimately taking White's d pawn and opening avenues for my Queen to get in on the fun maybe with Qa5+ or Qb6 Qb4+.

Alternatively my Knight moves back to e4 lets the Bishop take him then pushes d5; White takes en passant exd6 cxd6 and Black ends up with a nice center good development the Bishop pair maybe also White's KR pawn though that gives White some attacking chances. Still it seems as if White should be punished more.  Hmmmm."

[But Black's Queen would take the Knight.] Can Black defend f3? Of course Black's King retreat to g8 provides another defender for f7 and frees the Bishop to attack g5.

This opponent has a fun aggressive style.  But he'll win more games using the Analyze feature and 'Flip' to see the board like his opponent does.  Using the Game DB feature may help his opening. Getting your pieces developed before an attack is often helpful.  Attacks that work in over the board chess often fail in correspondence chess where time pressure is almost nonexistent and the Analyze feature enables players to play out positions."

As it is the mirror game to 'Activity vs. Aggression' from the same tournament I'll focus on the same themes as they apply to a very different game. The basics: Activity is the ability to which a player can move and threaten different squares. Aggression is the actual production of threats which the opponent must answer. Generally speaking the player with more activity gets to make the threats.

Black's kingside looks difficult to develop in any case and his Queen is somewhat trapped on the queenside all alone--not in any particular danger but Black must beware of any nets being woven around her.

I think 9.Ng3 Bg6 10.Bg5 was better as the text gives up--once more--a decent White piece for a passive Black one for the sake of playing for aggression rather than activity. It is worth noting however that White has the Knights against Black's Bishops in a solidly-closed center so White should still have an advantage there unless Black can open the position.

The kingside is pretty well locked up for the moment on account of the threat of f4-f5 so Black moved for queenside counterplay but the tension generated last move between d4-c5 was very beneficial to Black! Now this advance just guarantees that his DSB will be harder to develop. Better was 12...O-O-O in preparation for White's f4-f5.

White seeks to strike at the Black castle but this oversight just hangs a pawn and lets Black develop his Bishop with tempo. Better was 14.f5! (the computer seems to agree with me suggesting f4-f5 pretty much every move in this area). The closed center favors White's Knights so he should be using them to their maximum potential and abusing Black's difficult position not pushing pawns.

Consider the position as a whole: Black has the bishop-pair and an extra pawn but the position is closed and the BQ is stuck on the queenside. Clearly queenside aggression will be difficult to manage in this situation with only Knights to work with and those on the kingside--so work with what's already looking strong. White has a good Rook on f1 which will be lifted by force to an extremely strong outpost on f5 after (say) 16.f5! exf5 17.a3 Be7 18.Nxf5 Bxf5 19.Rxf5. This sets White up to double on the half-open f-file in front of an isolated Black pawn--a good recipe for success. It also brings the action to the kingside where all the White pieces already are and gives the Ne2 a place to go (namely f4 or g3).

It's also worth noting that White can essentially force Black to give up his bishop-pair which is certainly a tempting proposition if the center ever opens up (and it will somewhat after f4-f5).

I just went over the reasons why a direct queenside attack is not going to work: namely that Black has pieces stuck over there and White has pieces that can't get there. White should be maximizing the advantages he has not trying to find some where there aren't any! On the other hand Black has been playing consistently with a clear goal--he will push f7-f6 and release himself from his cramped position.

In the meantime Black worked toward a single simple goal: push f7-f6 to increase the scope of his Bishops. Now those Bishops are looking much better and White has little to show for the time he spent.

431,11,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Hi all! This game is all about activity aggression and timing--specifically how they relate and the differences between them. Broadly: activity is the main goal of chess at all times: more activity virtually always improves your position. Activity and Aggression sometimes look and feel similar but they are not the same thing. Activity is simply the ability to move to and control many squares. Aggression is a more violent concept--playing aggressively means making serious concrete threats. Activity almost always leads to aggression and occasionally aggression can be converted into beneficial activity.
432,11,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Timing comes into play in recognizing when this latter case (aggression --> activity) is possible and when it is not. When it is the opportunity for tactics arises. When it is not there exists the possibility for unsound aggression--aggression that does not in fact increase our activity or overall winning chances. Generally speaking the more active our pieces the more chances we have to play aggressively. In this way activity builds on itself to beget more activity.
433,11,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',?! More common are 2.d4 or 2.Nf3. In the text White decides to avoid the QGD-like lines and instead aim for total control of d5.
434,11,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Since ...d5 won't be possible (or at least the line is unclear after 2...d5 3.cxd5 exd5 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.Nc3) this is Black's best place for the d-pawn at the moment where it can support ...c7-c5.
435,11,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Already with no pieces developed on either side White has a significant spatial advantage.
436,11,5,Ne7,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1nppp/3pp3/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't like this move. The Knight belongs on f6; Black should simply put it there. The text is needlessly timid.
437,11,6,Nd7,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnnppp/3pp3/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And again. Black is perhaps preparing to play ...c5 but his Bishop belongs on d7 not his Knight. Now Black requires at least two moves to develop another piece.
438,11,7,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppnnpp1/3pp2p/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This does nothing to contribute to the opening goals of developing pieces controlling the center and safeguarding the King. White was not threatening Bg5 so why defend against it? Black's consistently passive play is not doing him any favors.
439,11,8,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/pppnnpb1/3pp1pp/8/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Though no captures or serious errors have been made the computer puts White ahead by a full pawn and I agree. White's pieces are developed to natural squares and have plenty of potential whereas Black's only decent piece is his Bishop. Black cannot even castle because of the weak h6 pawn.
440,11,9,b4,b'r1bqk2r/1ppnnpb1/p2pp1pp/8/1PPPP3/2N1BN2/P2QBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq b3',Since Black still can't get his King out of the center because of the weak h-pawn White happily gobbles up some more available space and prevents ...c5 since his pieces are almost all developed to active squares and Black has no obvious response to a large-scale center/queenside expansion.
441,11,10,b6,b'r1bqk2r/2pnnpb1/pp1pp1pp/8/1PPPP3/2N1BN2/P2QBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black hasn't moved anything past his third rank yet and has pushed six pawns in nine moves! The specific goals of the opening are easy to identify and generalize: do that which grants you the most activity for your forces. Black is not playing to maximize activity so his position has already become cramped.
442,11,11,e5,b'r2qk2r/1bpnnpb1/pp1p2pp/4p3/1PPPP3/2N1BN2/P2QBPPP/1R3RK1 w kq -',Black certainly needs a break but this is inaccurate giving White the opportunity to lock out both Black Bishops with 12.d5! or simply blast apart the center with 12.dxe5. Better was 11...c5. Already it's clear how White's advantage in space and energy badly restrict the Black options.
443,11,12,1c5,b'r2qk2r/1bpnnpb1/pp1p2pp/2P1p3/1P1PP3/2N1BN2/P2QBPPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',!? Interesting thought rather than close Black out of the center White chooses to preserve the tension and prevent Black from playing the freeing ...c5.
444,11,13,1b5,b'r2qk2r/1bpnnpb1/p2p2pp/1pP1p3/1P1PP3/2N1BN2/P2QBPPP/1R3RK1 w kq -',12...Nc6 was better. The text just gives White an excuse to play a move he wanted to play anyway. Note that White spent the opening maximizing piece energy whereas Black did not--as a direct consequence White's natural moves now feel aggressive whereas Black's positioning gives him very little opportunity for counterplay.
445,11,14,1a4,b'r2qk2r/1bpnnpb1/p2p2pp/1pP1p3/PP1PP3/2N1BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 b kq a3',! White sacrifices a pawn to open lines and begin his attack in earnest. This move is not even hard to find: White seeks to push the queenside and increase his pieces' activity; this move half-opens a queenside file and energizes White's LSB his least active piece.
446,11,15,1d5,b'r2qk2r/1bpnnpb1/p2p2pp/2PPp3/pP2P3/2N1BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',! Of course not 14.Nxa4?! Bxe4 freeing Black's game. The passed pawn on a4 is no threat whatsoever so White is free to ignore it and instead grab more space for his well-placed Bishops. White simply finds the best moves to increase his piece activity and the attack flows naturally from it.
447,11,16,1f5,b'r2qk2r/1bpnn1b1/p2p2pp/2PPpp2/pP2P3/2N1BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 w kq f6',? Black with passive pieces and a very cramped game tries a break but his timing is all wrong. This is not a case where aggression can produce activity--by opening the center he's simply exposing his King to the elements. More to the point White was threatening 15.c6! winning a piece (and yet more queenside space!) and this does not stop it. Black would have been much better off playing 14...Nf6 threatening 15...Nxe4! 16.Nxe4 Nxd5 with three pawns for the piece and a far more comfortable position. It's worth noting that fourteen moves into the game Black has made ten moves with pawns and only four with pieces! It's no wonder he is behind in activity.
448,11,17,1exf5,b'r2qk2r/2pn2b1/p1bp2pp/4pP2/pP6/2N1BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',Black has opened the center but he has nothing to show for it! His Bishop now has a slightly better game but his King is dangerously centralized (and h6 is still hanging if he castles!) and the White pieces are vastly better-placed sitting on the spots they were first developed to.
449,11,18,1g5,b'r2qk2r/2pn2b1/p1bp3p/4pPp1/pP6/2N1BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 w kq -',? 17...gxf5 was a much better bet. Black should fortify his center pawn majority and energize his forces not push pawns willy-nilly and hand a dangerous passer to White.
450,11,19,1Nd5,b'r2qk2r/2pn2b1/p1bp3p/3NpPp1/pP6/4BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',?! Probably inaccurate but certainly not terrible. White thinks to slide his Rf1-c1 and increase the queenside pressure with major pieces on three half-open files while making kingside threats to occupy Black's forces. Possibly 18.Qa2 would have been a simpler cleaner play here winning the a4 pawn.
451,11,20,1Bxd5,b'r2qk2r/2pn2b1/p2p3p/3bpPp1/pP6/4BN2/3QBPPP/1R3RK1 w kq -',18...Nf6 would have been stronger; the text trades off Black's only good piece and lifts the WQ to a devastatingly powerful outpost on d5.
452,11,21,2Qc6+,b'r2qk2r/2p3b1/p1Qp1n1p/4pPp1/pP6/4BN2/4BPPP/1R3RK1 b kq -',The correct move winning a pawn after 20...Nd7 21.Qxa4 and putting tremendous pressure on a6. Black has only made one real mistake but White has already won. Note how aggressive White's play *looks* even though truly he is just making calm precise moves with the goal of continuing to maximize his activity and compound his advantages.
453,11,22,2Ke7,b'r2q3r/2p1k1b1/p1Qp1n1p/4pPp1/pP6/4BN2/4BPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',? It often feels embarrassing somehow to move a piece back to the space it just came from but here 20...Nd7 was really the only good move. This is Black's first really terrible single mistake of the game but now White has a tactic to win another pawn and break open the BK's last lines of defense and Black could resign right here.
454,11,23,2Nxe5,b'r2q3r/2p1k1b1/p1Qp1n1p/4NPp1/pP6/4B3/4BPPP/1R3RK1 b - -',! White's first and only tactical shot of the game. Black cannot retake because of 21...dxe5?? 22.Qe6+ Kf8 23.Bc5+ and White will win the Queen and the game soon after.
455,11,24,2Re8,b'r2qr3/2p1k1b1/p1Qp1n1p/4NPp1/pP6/4B3/4BPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I think 21...Qc8 was better freeing d8 for the King to retreat and looking for a chance to eliminate the thorny White pawn at f5. Black obviously wants to slip his King to f8 and back into the corner behind his Rook but there's no reason that White should need to allow that.
456,11,25,2Bc4,b'r2qr3/2p1k1b1/p1Qp1n1p/4NPp1/pPB5/4B3/5PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Good moves continue to flow naturally from the position combined with White's goals. This Bishop was one of White's least active pieces and he wants to prevent the BK from escaping the center. Now the Bishop is hugely active and White is suddenly threatening mate with 23.Ng6 (of course 22...dxe5?? is still not an option).
457,11,26,2Nd7,b'r2qr3/2pnk1b1/p1Qp3p/4NPp1/pPB5/4B3/5PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',?? This is only Black's second really serious mistake but it is sufficient. He needed ...Qc8 to vacate d8 for his King. Now White has a couple of choices on how to proceed--but it's over either way. There are at least two choices for White's 23rd move; both lead to mate in five. Try to find them before continuing on.
458,11,27,2Qd5,b'r2qr3/2pnk1b1/p2p3p/3QNPp1/pPB5/4B3/5PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Also possible was the somewhat flashier 23.f6+! Kxf6 24.Qf3+ Kxe5 25.Bd4+ Kxd4 26.Qd5+ Kc3 27.Rfc1# which I had looked at but didn't see the full combination. This move was easier to find.
459,11,28,2Qxf7#,b'r2qr3/2p1kQ2/p2p3p/5Pp1/pPB5/4B3/5PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',I hope you find this game instructive.

520,14,6,Ne6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/4n3/4P3/3Q4/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',the miss place of the black knight causing black to move again with the same place  but at least its takes of the knight from a hitt square g5 which my DSB is attacking it . and attacks the white queen on d4 which is buying some time for black to develop his peices .
521,14,7,1Qe3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/4n3/4P3/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',good move  the white queen remains in its active position which takes space advantage and still controls the center . the block on my DSB doesn't bother me because anyway  i thought to develop it to a3 which controls a1-f8 diagonal .
522,14,8,1d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3pn3/4P3/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',good move . the idea is to exchange piecs as more as you can when your opponent makes pressure on you  and if its opposite try to avoid the exchange for keeping the pressure .

Ne5 Nd5 14. Qf3 Nd5 Or if 12. Bd2 Qa6 13. Qxa6 Nxa6 with a slight advantage for black. 
556,15,14,Qxd6,b'rn2k2r/pp3pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/3P4/3Q1NN1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',The first main sortie is over and white has nothing worth while to show for it. The game is a dead draw
557,15,15,1O-O,b'rn2k2r/pp3pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/3P4/3Q1NN1/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b kq -',I decide to castle king side because my main idea of attack is going to be c2-c4 followed by d4-d5. Which has the advantage of breaking up black's strong control of d5. 
558,15,16,1Nbd7,b'r3k2r/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/3P4/3Q1NN1/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w kq -',This knight almost always belongs here. I am glad that Dmaestro did not play 0-0 since it has been often proven that many times in the caro kann the black king is better placed on e7 than on g7. So it is wise to forgo castling until white initiates his attack.
559,15,17,O-O,b'r4rk1/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/2PP4/3Q1NN1/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',a good solid move that does not try to force something that is not there. The other chief idea is 14. ...a5 is pointless. 
560,15,18,1Rad1,b'r4rk1/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/2PP4/3Q1NN1/PP3PP1/3R1RK1 b - -',Since there is no attacking chances I decide to strengthen my center and centralize my rooks. Black has the same idea. 
561,15,19,1Rfe1,b'3r1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2pqpn1p/7P/2PP4/3Q1NN1/PP3PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',with my development complete I plan to try a queen side pawn storm via a3 and b4. 
562,15,20,1Qc7,b'3r1rk1/ppqn1pp1/2p1pn1p/7P/2PP4/3Q1NN1/PP3PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',a very good move that I think has two purposes #1 move the Queen to a more secure square on c7 and #2 prepare counter play via ...c5.

The right plan is to sit back and let white try to force a breakthrough. Which of course it near impossible. However I played 17. a3 to rattle black's cage in the hopes that he would become desperate. 
564,15,22,1c5,b'3r1rk1/ppqn1pp1/4pn1p/2p4P/2PP4/P2Q1NN1/1P3PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',!! this is a great move for black. Even though it is risky to voluntary weaken d5. Having said all of that instead of just sitting back and allowing white to come at him black finds the most active defense.  The most solid and safest move is 17. ...Rfe8
565,15,23,1d5,b'3r1rk1/ppqn1pp1/4pn1p/2pP3P/2P5/P2Q1NN1/1P3PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',Now white has the chance to open things up slightly in his favor.

Here black is slightly better because of his superior pawn structure. But white is not without chances since the d5 pawn is well defended and cramping black's position. In short this is a very double edged position. 
567,15,25,1Nb6,b'3r1rk1/ppq2pp1/1n3n1p/2pP3P/8/P2Q1NN1/1P3PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',?? Black has ideas of immediately attacking the isolated pawn but however he does not do it the right way. The way to handle a isolated pawn is to #1 block-aid it #2 control the square directly in front of it. #3 attack it by bring every piece you have to bare on it and in that order. In this case Black does #3 first and tries to do #2 but never has a chance to do #1. So this is how black wins the pawn 19. ...c4!(the knight on e7 is the blockaid after the pawn is obliged to move to d6) 20. Qd4 Qc5(threatening to win the d5 pawn) 21. Nf5 Rfe8 22. Rxe8 Rxe8 23. Qxc5 Nxc5 24. Nd6 Rd8 25. Nxc4 Rxd5 and black has a slightly better endgame.

The logical behind whites plan is step #1 amass piece superior around the area of the enemy king. This will come in the form of Ne5 Nf5 Qf3 and Re5. step #2 is to expose the king by a knight sacrifice on g7 or h6. And finally step #3 breakthrough where all of white's piece swarm the black king.

575,15,33,2g6,b'1q1r1rk1/pp3p2/3P2pp/2p1RN1n/8/P4Q2/1P3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',it seems logical to try and drive the knight out of f5 but this is not very good for black. When being attacked it is recommended to keep the pawns in front of your king at home. Instead try and bring more of your pieces closer to the defense of your king. For black I would recommend 24. ...Nf6 as being the best chance of defending.

Even in the middle game black was doing very well. However black did try the great but risky 17. ...c5 which needed razor sharp defending on his part to pull off. In the end black misplayed the isolated pawn and got crushed on the king side. From a teaching perspective it is instructive to walk through how white executed a well formed plan that ended with a classic attack on the king side. In my opinion players who swear by playing attack chess will do well to understand how and why White's attack succeeded. 
583,16,0,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A rather quiet first move for Black but this second move is rather curious.  Interesting.

601,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is the first team match game I have finished so far and the game is quite one sided but it is still kind of nice. 
602,17,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',I almost never see this reply in my OTB or online chess games anymore. About 10% of the time this move is played against me by my opponents. The overwhelming favorite is the Sicilian defense then the French. 
603,17,2,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So the game is a Scotch Gambit. Although the computer doesn't like it it is probably the perfect choice against a human player-Gains activity early on which is definitely the right idea and totally solid fundamentally. Even at the expert level this is a great choice.
604,17,3,Ne4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/2Bpn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This line is almost never seen. For most of my experienced opponents ...d5 is automatic. However this move is acceptable.
605,17,4,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pP3/2Bpn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',The move order change favors white because now taking the pawn forces black to take back awkwardly with the knight not the bishop and so black does not gain any development advantage there. Anyways white is better developed so it should be obvious.
606,17,5,Bd5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2nn4/3B4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',It's the best move maximizing the bishop's activity. Now white should have very nice compensation for the pawn. My opponent makes a big mistake on the next move.
607,17,6,Ne7,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/3n4/3B4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',A terrible move that blocks in the dark squared bishop. In open positions this kind of thing cannot be acceptable. So now white has a major lead in development his goal is to create maximum contact between the pieces creating tactics. Such tactics must be in white's favor for he has more activity.
608,17,7,1h3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/2pn4/8/3p2b1/1B3N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',Here I totally forgot about my previous analysis and instantly played this inaccurate move. The move I had planned to make was 11.Bf4 to me clearly the best move. For some reason the Gameknot analysis engine suggested the rather odd line starting with 11.Qxd4(looks impossible to be the best move). Although the computer says it is best I just can't bring myself to believe it at all. Black can ruin the kingside pawns(although that is the least of matters) and with Ndf5 can untangle his position on the queenside at least. White still has a clear advantage in this line and I can see why the computer likes it but my line is probably better. With the game comtinuation now black should just take the f3 knnight ...Qa5 then castle long with a holdable position although white has more than enough compensation.
609,17,8,1Bh5,b'r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/2pn4/7b/3p4/1B3N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',Very poor move. Now I breathed a sigh of relief as the win is safely in my pocket-I have a huge initiative and the black's pieces are very poorly placed and backwards.

By the way it is cool to see that the general principles work even in the open tactical positions- Here we should keep up the pressure as releasing it helps the opponent and tactically it works. Is it a coincidence? Probably not. The most fundamental princniples are usually working in all kinds of posiitons.

619,18,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The main move is 3.Nxe5 usually followed by 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 when White has a number of choices the most common being 5.d4 but also the recently popular 5.Nc3 is possible and some less interesting lines (5.d3 and 5.Qe2). Here 3.d4 is another possibility and even 3.Bc4 can be played. The text is also possible but less challenging to Black.
620,18,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This has to be the simplest of all openings: the four knights.

624,18,6,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',!? A rare move. Far more common is 8.exd5 cxd5. This move breaks the pin but does not really challenge Black.
625,18,7,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',I looked at a pawn-winning line namely 8...Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 dxe4 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 but my pawn structure after that is pretty awkward and I'm lacking in development so I decided not to play it. What I didn't even see is that 12.Bxg7 would immediately win the pawn back and after 12...Rg8 White has the intermezzo 13.Bf6+ and can defend his g2 pawn afterwards so the line wouldn't even have won a pawn after all.
626,18,8,Bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2bB4/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',But now that we have castled I can take with the rook on d8 in the line mentioned before so I decided the pawn win was safe now.
627,18,9,1Qh5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/3p3Q/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',?! White was playing passively until now but now that he gets aggressive it's just the wrong time for it. He prevents 11...Nxc3?? 12.Qxh7# and 11...Nf6?? to chase the queen is also not possible because of 12.Bxf6 and there's a mating threat on h7 again. But I have...
628,18,10,1g6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/2p3p1/3p3Q/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',... This move which does weaken the dark squares around the king but chases the queen and prevents the mate.
629,18,11,1Qe5,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/2p3p1/3pQ3/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Another mating threat but it's easily parried again. 12.Qh6 does not accomplish anything either after 12...Nxc3 13.bxc3 and now for example 13...Qf6 and White has to retreat to prevent losing a second pawn.
630,18,12,1Qf4,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p4p/2p2pp1/3p4/4nQ2/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Seems like the best square since on d4 it can be chased yet again with 13...c5. (Yes it can be chased from this square with 13...g5 but that would needlessly weaken the kingside.)
631,18,13,1bxc3,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p4p/2p2pp1/3p4/5Q2/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',We can see now that Black has an advantage. He is a pawn up and has nice central control. The only factors that may be to White's advantage are the slightly unstable position of the Black king and White's superior development but there are no immediate threats so Black can simply develop and try to catch up with White before White can take advantage of those advantages.
632,18,14,1Qd6,b'r1b2rk1/p1p4p/2pq1pp1/3p4/5Q2/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Proposing a queens exchange and if White refuses he has to move his queen yet again to a more passive square.
633,18,15,1Qe3,b'r1b2rk1/p1p4p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The exchange with 15.Qxd6 cxd6 would give Black a strange pawn structure of which it's not clear to me whether it's strong or weak. The computer thinks that 15.Qh4 would have been slightly better because on e3 the queen is vulnerable to attacks yet again this time by the rooks that cannot wait to be developed onto the open e-file.
634,18,16,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Developing connecting the rooks and covering the e8 square (if I would have developed the bishop to say b7 and White would have played 16.Rfe1 I could not have played 16...Rfe8? because White could then get two rooks for a queen with 17.Qxe8+! Rxe8 18.Rxe8+ Kg7).
635,18,17,1Rfe1,b'r4rk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',The computer prefers 16.c4 probably to prevent 1 ...c4 push by me and to close the center where Black has a pawn majority. The pawn exchange with 16...dxc4 17.Bxc4+  does not offer Black real winning chances due to his doubled c-pawns and the lack of a passed pawn.
636,18,18,1Rae8,b'4rrk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',!? I did not do a safety check before this move and was awakened by White's next move. But actually this move is not bad at all since for the pawn White gets superior center control and Black's queen is in an awkward position after it has taken the pawn on a7. But if I'd have seen that my pawn would be hanging I'd have played 16...Rfe8 for sure.
637,18,19,c5,b'4rrk1/Q1pb3p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Highlighting the bad position of the White queen threatening to trap her with ...Ra8 and/or ...Bc6.
638,18,20,1Qa3,b'4rrk1/2pb3p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/Q1PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',The computer proposes 18.Rxe8 Rxe8 (perhaps to reduce the activity of Black's major pieces) followed by 19.c4.
639,18,21,1Re7,b'5rk1/2pbr2p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/Q1PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',?! Preparing to double on the e-file. Fritz prefers 18...Ra8 to threaten the queen but that moves the rook off the open e-file which I found a bit strange (I didn't play it because I thought it wouldn't accomplish anything).
640,18,22,1Rad1,b'5rk1/2pbr2p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/Q1PB4/P1P2PPP/3RR1K1 b - -',?! Again Fritz prefers 19.c4 to close off the center and gives that position as equal (White has the passed pawn Black the more activity).
641,18,23,1Rfe8,b'4r1k1/2pbr2p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/Q1PB4/P1P2PPP/3RR1K1 w - -',Natural but Fritz wants me to play 19...Rxe1+ 20.Rxe1 c4 now to chase the bishop to a passive square.
642,18,24,2Qc1,b'4r1k1/2pbr2p/3q1pp1/2pp4/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/2QRR1K1 b - -',The last chance for 20.Rxe7 Qxe7 21.c4. Now Black does it.
643,18,25,Re7e5,b'4r1k1/2pb3p/3q1pp1/3pr3/2p5/2P5/P1P2PPP/2QRRBK1 w - -',Black has more center control and more space but is it enough to win? A club member with a rating of 1800 who was playing in a higher section of the tournament suggested after the game that I should have played 21...Bf5 here which I had considered but I thought White could just hold and the computer agrees. I noted during the game that 22.Bxc4?? is not possible because I can simply take with 22...dxc4! and the queen on d6 is immune due to the back rank mating threat.
644,18,26,2Qd2,b'4r1k1/2pb3p/5pp1/3pq3/2p5/2P5/P1PQ1PPP/3R1BK1 b - -',Forced to defend c3. Attacks d5 at the same time.
645,18,27,2c6,b'4r1k1/3b3p/2p2pp1/3pq3/2p5/2P5/P1PQ1PPP/3R1BK1 w - -',Freeing my pieces from the defence of d5. Here 24.Bxc4 still does not work.
646,18,28,2f3,b'4r1k1/3b3p/2p2pp1/3pq3/2p5/2P2P2/P1PQ2PP/3R1BK1 b - -',Maybe to tempt me into playing my next move but it seems more natural to play 24.a4 to try and get the passed pawn to the 8th rank.
647,18,29,2Qe3+,b'4r1k1/3b3p/2p2pp1/3p4/2p5/2P1qP2/P1PQ2PP/3R1BK1 w - -',?! Forcing a queen exchange thinking I could win the c-pawn afterwards but forgetting about the Bxc4 threat.
648,18,30,2Bxc4,b'6k1/3b3p/2p2pp1/3p4/2B5/2P1rP2/P1P3PP/3R2K1 b - -',! of course. Now 26...dxc4 leads almost immediately to a draw after 27.Rxd7 Rxc3 and the rook ending must be an easy draw so I decided to keep the bishops on the board.
649,18,31,2Bb3,b'6k1/3b3p/2p2pp1/3p4/8/1Br2P2/P1P3PP/3R2K1 b - -',Everything just holds for White.
650,18,32,2Bf5,b'6k1/7p/2p2pp1/3p1b2/8/1Br2P2/P1P3PP/3R2K1 w - -',?! An inaccuracy by me. Better was 27...Kf8.
651,18,33,2Rd2,b'6k1/7p/2p2pp1/3p1b2/8/1Br2P2/P1PR2PP/6K1 b - -',?! White returns the favour. 28.g4! was possible because 28...Bxc2?? fails to 29.Rc1 and the bishop is lost or an exchange after 29...Bxb3 30.Rxc3.
652,18,34,2Re2,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/3p1b2/8/1Br2P2/P1P1R1PP/6K1 b - -',Probably to block my king but it seems better to get his own king involved.
653,18,35,d3,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/5b2/6P1/1Brp1P2/P1P1R2P/6K1 w - -',?! This leads almost immediately to a draw and probably even a slight advantage for'White. My club mate proposed 30...Bd7 to continue with ...c5 (attacking the a4 pawn) when ...c4 trapping the bishop becomes a real threat.
654,18,36,3cxd3,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/5b2/6P1/1BrP1P2/P3R2P/6K1 b - -',Of course not 31.gxf5?? dxe2. A rook move is no good either because then 31...dxc2 with the threat of promotion wins material.
655,18,37,3Re3,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/8/6P1/1BrbRP2/P6P/6K1 b - -',?! 32.Re6 even wins a pawn for White but probably Black has enough activity to hold the draw. But at least White could have tried it. But  maybe White having defended the whole game was content with a draw. Now Black can reach the draw quite easily.
656,18,38,Bc4,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/8/2b3P1/1B2RP2/P4K1P/2r5 w - -',The exchange of bishops leaves us with a single rook ending with four pawns each.
657,18,39,3Rc3,b'5k2/7p/2p2pp1/8/P5P1/2R2P2/5K1P/r7 b - -',If White wanted to try something he should have played 36.Rb4 when he has the passed pawn that is the hardest to reach for the kings because it's far from where the kings are and which is also one step closer to promotion but the rook would be forced to stay on the fourth rank to defend it and the pawn would not be able to advance any further so that would be a draw as well I guess.
658,18,40,3Rxc6,b'5k2/7p/2R2pp1/8/r5P1/5P2/5K1P/8 b - -',Now that the passed pawns are exchanged we're left with three pawns each on the same wing. No one can really try anything in this position so my opponent offered a draw which I accepted. I think it was a quite solid game overall with some mistakes from both sides. I held the advantage for most of the game but a draw always seemed to be a likely result. Hope you enjoyed thanks for reading!
659,19,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Today we get to see what happens when you don't make a simple safety check before each and every move! Especially in a long format like here on GK where you have plenty of time for each move there's no reason to have to rely on your calculations from a move ago--check again! In this game I miss a couple of simple tactics and pay for it dearly. Enjoy!
660,19,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! The fun but dubious Latvian Gambit. I have a large number of annotations that go into more detail about this opening so I won't cover it in-depth here.
661,19,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the main line.
662,19,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! The Fraser Variation. More common are 3...Qf6 or 3...Nf6.
663,19,4,Nxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2N3p1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',?! Unusual. At this point it's usually better for White to simply win the Rook and then ride out whatever attack Black can produce ie. after 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7.
664,19,5,Bd3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2p2np1/5p2/4P3/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',?! Preparing to castle as well as putting pressure on f5. White doesn't want to allow Black to develop his Bishops with tempo (ie. 7.exf5? Bxf5) for sure though this move also stifles White's own DSB. I think 7.Nc3 or 7.d3 would have been simpler here.
665,19,6,Nxe4,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1q2p/2p3p1/5p2/4n3/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',? I thought a while about this one and ultimately I think I made the wrong choice. The trade is even materially but it releases the tension and frees White's pieces while creating some problems for Black. 8...Bd7 was better preparing for queenside castling.
666,19,7,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1q2p/2p1b1p1/8/4R3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB3K1 w - -',White is behind in development for now but his Rook and Queen are far better than any of Black's forces.
667,19,8,1Re1,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1q2p/2p1b1p1/8/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - -',I think 12.Qe3 would have been a stronger alternative. This allows potential tactics down the e-file for Black. Obviously something had to be done to prevent ...Bd5 winning but this move was needlessly passive in my opinion. Also good were 12.Nc3 or even better 12.c4.
668,19,9,Rhf8,b'2kr1r2/ppp3bp/2pqb1p1/8/8/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',White continues his development while Black struggles to put an attack together before White can consolidate. At this move I foresaw what I thought was a strong combination to blast open the WK.
669,19,10,Rxf2,b'2kr4/ppp3bp/2pqb1p1/8/8/2NPQ3/PPP2rPP/R1B1R1K1 w - -',?? No safety check. The idea is that White cannot retake on f2 because of 16...Bd4! and Black will give a Rook and Bishop for a Queen and pawn the initiative and vastly superior activity but I overlooked a critical intermezzo which would have been easy to catch if I'd only looked... Not to mention that 16.Qxf2 Bd4 17.Be3 Rf8 just loses a piece anyway for basically no compensation (good catch tiger_lilov)
670,19,11,1Qxe6+,b'2kr4/ppp3bp/2pqQ1p1/8/8/2NP4/PPP2rPP/R1B1R1K1 b - -',! White simply wins a piece for my troubles.
671,19,12,Rxc2,b'2kr4/ppp4p/2p1R1p1/8/3b4/2NPB3/PPr3PP/R5K1 w - -',?! Black must make the absolute most of his 2nd-rank Rook if he is to stay in the game. He still has a slight advantage in activity but this move gives up his initiative--I think 18...Bxe3 19.Rxe3 Rxc2 20.Rb1 Rd2 would have been much better.
672,19,13,Rxd3,b'2k5/ppp4p/2p1R1p1/8/4N3/3r4/PPr3PP/R5K1 w - -',Despite the error a few moves back Black still has a bit of a chance thanks to his powerful Rooks.
673,19,14,2Re7,b'2k5/ppp1R2p/2p3p1/8/4N3/3r4/PPr3PP/R5K1 b - -',! White locks the BK out (for now though of course he can eventually bring himself to bear via ...b6 Kb7-a6-b5 etc) and places his own Rook on the seventh rank choosing aggressive trades rather than passive defense which is always the correct choice when slightly ahead in a Rook endgame. White also sets a trap...
674,19,15,2Re3,b'2k5/ppp1R2p/2p3p1/8/4N3/4r3/PPr3PP/R5K1 w - -',"?? The prospect of a ""free"" piece baits me and again I'm too lazy to make a simple safety check. To lose now White would have to blunder badly. Much better was 21...Rxb2 22.Rxh7 Re3 23.Rf1 b6."
675,19,16,2Nd6+,b'2k5/ppp1R2p/2pN2p1/8/8/4r3/PPr3PP/R5K1 b - -',! White continues to play accurately.
676,19,17,d5,b'2k5/pp2R2p/2p3p1/3p4/8/8/Pr4PP/R5K1 w - -',Black has two passed connected center pawns but cannot get his King to them. White should not lose from this point as long as he plays correctly. I will only make a few more comments.
677,19,18,g5,b'3kr3/pp3R1R/2p5/3p2p1/8/8/P5PP/6K1 w - -',? Not a useful move. Black might as well try to prepare for pushing his center pawns with 28...b6.
678,19,19,3a4,b'1k2r3/R6R/2p5/3p2p1/P7/8/6PP/6K1 b - a3',31.Rac7 was better picking off Black's final chance at holding (Black cannot defend the pawn at all: 31...Rc8?? 32.Rb7+ Ka8 33.Ra7+ Kb8 34.Rhb7#).
679,19,20,3Rad7,b'1k2r3/3R3R/2p5/6p1/P2p4/8/6PP/6K1 b - -',White actually plays very inaccurately here and for the next several moves but never badly enough to lose. The c-pawn was still the correct target not the d-pawn.
680,19,21,Re8,b'1k2r3/3R3R/8/6p1/P1p5/3p4/6PP/6K1 w - -',The BR cannot stay on c8 of course.
681,19,22,4g3,b'k3r3/P2R3R/8/8/2p3p1/3p2P1/7P/5K2 b - -',Much stronger was 41.Rb7! d2 42.Rb8+ Rxb8 43.axb8=Q+ Kxb8 44.Ke2 c3 45.Kd1!
682,19,23,4Rxc3,b'k7/P7/8/8/6p1/2R3P1/3pK2P/8 b - -',This is best. Now it's a simple KR-K mate.
683,19,24,6Ra8#,b'R7/8/8/8/6p1/6P1/k1K4P/8 b - -',Hope you enjoyed it! Learn from my failures--look out every move for tactics you might have missed a move ago! Comments are most welcome; thanks for reading!

689,20,5,e6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/2pPP1b1/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',This move seems to lose momentum.
690,20,6,Bxc4,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/2BPP1b1/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Now I have three minor pieces and substantial control of the center.

696,20,12,1Nce7,b'r2qk1nr/ppp1nppp/8/3Pp3/2B1P3/2P1BP2/P4P1P/R2QK2R w KQkq -',My opponent retreats which now gives me control of the center since now there are no minor pieces developed to challenge my bishops.

717,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! Annotating this game on a request from chicoboy who was playing the White pieces. A bloody opening leaves only Rooks and a couple minor pieces left on the board and each player misses a couple important safety checks in the dangerous mid-end game which their opponents are happy to capitalize on. Enjoy!
718,21,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Petrov's Three Knights' Game. This can easily transpose to an equal (if perhaps dull) Four Knights' Game with 3...Nc6 or stay the Petrov line with 3...Bb4 (where Black will get his e-pawn back without much trouble if White cares to take it) and fighting chances.
719,21,2,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is more reserved than 3...Bb4 but certainly playable. It has the disadvantage of blocking the KB somewhat but with this move Black reinforces his center and prepares to play ...Be7 and either ...Bg4 or ...Be6.
720,21,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Good solid development. Also possible was an immediate 4.d4! with a nice gain of space for White. Note that Bc4 doesn't really prevent Black from playing ...Be6 as after 5.Bxe6 fxe6 the half-open f-file could prove more troublesome for White than for Black.
721,21,4,d3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This is a solid move; White bolsters his center and frees his QB but I prefer 5.d4! Black can do nothing to prevent White from claiming the extra space and therefore freedom of movement afforded by d2-d4 so White may as well play it.
722,21,5,d4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',?! Okay now this is strange. Why take two moves to play d2-d4? There's no good reason. I give this a ?! rather than a straight ? because the d4 thrust is a good idea; it just should have been played at once. Better options were probably 6.O-O or 6.Be3 simply continuing development.
723,21,6,Bg4,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black's moves continue to be straightforward and logical. Another possibility worth a look was the immediate 6...exd4!? where Black maintains the initiative after White retakes and may play ...Nc6 or ...c5 at his leisure.
724,21,7,dxe5,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',?! I think this is probably a mistake; Black now cannot avoid the loss of a pawn. Probably 7...Bxf3 8.Qxf3 dxe5 was a better move order as now White can break the pin with tempo. So Black is the first to miss a quick safety check and the balance swings in White's favor.
725,21,8,O-O,b'rn1r2k1/ppp1bppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',? It remains to be seen whether the weakened pawn structure White inherits (after Bxf3 gxf3) will severely impact his game but regardless he should simply have played 9.Nxe5 and taken the free pawn. Missing the clearly correct choice White shunts the advantage off to the Black side of the board.
726,21,9,Bxf3,b'rn1r2k1/ppp1bppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2b2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Not bad though I like 9...Nc6 here a little more (developing and threatening ...Nd4 if the Nf3 moves).
727,21,10,1Nd5,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3Np3/2B1P3/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 b - -',This is a strong move essentially forcing Black to trade off his KN to get rid of White's powerful active Knight.
728,21,11,1exd5,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3Pp3/2B5/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 b - -',This however is not so strong. By retaking with the pawn rather than the Bishop White isolates his doubled f-pawns and limits the Bishop's scope. 12.Bxd5 would keep the Bishop active and put pressure on both f7 and b7 as well as preventing an eventual ...e4 push from Black.
729,21,12,1Nd4,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bppp/8/3Pp3/2Bn4/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Strong forking the f3 and c2 pawns.
730,21,13,1c3,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bppp/8/3Pp3/2Bn4/2P2P2/PP3P1P/R1B2RK1 b - -',? Black was going to pick up a free pawn anyway; better was to either develop with 13.Be3 or make Black choose between the check and the material while trying to get rid of the doubled pawn on good terms with 13.f4!?
731,21,14,g6,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bp1p/6p1/3Pp3/2B5/2P2n2/PP3P1P/R1B2R1K w - -',? The only reason for this is because of the eventual threat of Rg1 but White has no attacking prospects right now so instead Black is simply inviting the White Bishop to invade h6.
732,21,15,1Bh6,b'r2r2k1/ppp1bp1p/6pB/3Pp3/2B5/2P2n2/PP3P1P/R4R1K b - -',White happily obliges.
733,21,16,1Bd6,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/3b2pB/3Pp3/2B5/2P2n2/PP3P1P/R4R1K w - -',Setting up more pressure on h2.
734,21,17,1Bxf3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/3b2pB/3P4/4p3/2P2B2/PP3P1P/R4R1K b - -',This is best I think. White loses the Bishop pair but he needed to neutralize the kingside Black pawns.
735,21,18,1Rae1,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/3b2pB/3P4/8/2P2p2/PP3P1P/4RR1K b - -',Seizing the open file. Trapping the f-Rook behind the pawn is ugly but there's not much else to be done for it though 18.Rad1 was probably worth a look (despite giving up control of the e-file).
736,21,19,1Bc5,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/6pB/2bP4/8/2P2p2/PP3P1P/4RR1K w - -',This is the reason White moved the a-Rook instead of the f-Rook. If 18.Rfe1? Bc5 and White must drop another pawn.
737,21,20,1Be3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/2bP4/8/2P1Bp2/PP3P1P/4RR1K b - -',? This is simply a mistake. Best was 19.b4 and if 19...Bb6?! 20.c4 holds the pawn. Another simple check missed; another pawn lost.
738,21,21,1Bxe3,b'r2r2k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/3P4/8/2P1bp2/PP3P1P/4RR1K w - -',This actually gives White his pawn back if he cares to take it: 19...Bxe3 20.Rxe3 Rxd5 21.Rxf3 though it puts the White Rooks in an awkward and somewhat helpless position. Regardless 19...Rxd5 was the better choice preparing for ...Rad8. With this Black hands over some of the advantage he's gained giving White the chance pick up good Rook positioning in exchange for the pawn.
739,21,22,2Rfe1,b'r5k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/3r4/8/2P1Rp2/PP3P1P/4R2K b - -',Doubled Rooks on the open file. I think this is quite a bit stronger than 21.Rxf3 as I mentioned earlier. The f1 Rook really needed activation and White needs to retain control of the e-file. However it's worth mentioning that White must take f3 before he can go on the offensive since otherwise Black threatens a simple back-rank mate at any moment.
740,21,23,2Rxf3,b'r5k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/8/8/2P2R2/PP1r1P1P/4R2K b - -',This is good now as White retains the e-file and now threatens 23.Re7 with a surprisingly strong attack. Both players are playing solidly now.
741,21,24,2Rxb2,b'r5k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/8/8/2P2R2/Pr3P1P/4R2K w - -',? Black is in a very aggressive mindset and is thinking only about clearing off all the pawns but safeguarding his position with 22...Kf8 was a better choice as now White has access to e7. Advantage White.
742,21,25,2a4,b'r5k1/ppp2p1p/6p1/8/P7/2P2R2/1r3P1P/4R2K b - a3',? 23.Re7! was much better. White doesn't need the a-pawn when he has two Rooks so active--especially compared to Black's miserable Rook still on a8! Black now has the chance to correct his earlier mistake.
743,21,26,2c6,b'r5k1/pp3p1p/2p3p1/8/P7/2P2R2/1r3P1P/4R2K w - -',This could be worse as it forestalls White's material gains from Re7 but 23...Kf8 was still a much better choice preventing White from reaching e7 in the first place.
744,21,27,2Kg1,b'5rk1/pp2Rp1p/2p3p1/8/P7/2P2R2/1r3P1P/6K1 b - -',Fine though 25.Kg2 is more to the point. The Kings are weapons now for sure they should both be making their way towards the action.
745,21,28,2h5,b'5rk1/4Rp1p/p1p3p1/1p5P/P7/2P2R2/1r3P2/6K1 b - -',?! White is trying to sacrifice the h-pawn to blow open the BK's position but Black can simply not take it and play 27...bxa4 instead. Probably 27.Ra7 was better with an attempt to preserve the material White has left though it's not looking good for him. He's certainly not out of it yet though--Black's tragic f8 Rook is still practically not even participating which continues to give White a fighting chance.
746,21,29,2c4,b'5rk1/4Rp1p/p1p3p1/7P/p1P5/5R2/1r3P2/6K1 b - -',Necessary to prevent 28...a3.
747,21,30,2Rb3,b'5rk1/4Rp1p/p1p3p1/7P/p1P5/1r3R2/5P2/6K1 w - -',Black with a significant material lead now seeks simplification.
748,21,31,2Kg2,b'5rk1/4Rp1p/p1p3p1/7P/p1P5/1r3R2/5PK1/8 b - -',29.Rxb3 axb3 30.Rb7 probably deserves a look too but White is running out of options to stop Black from queening.
749,21,32,Rb8,b'1r4k1/4Rp1p/p1p3p1/7P/p1P5/5K2/5P2/8 w - -',This is an interesting choice. Black cuts off the WK's access to the a-file and prepares to interpose his Rook if White plays Re3 or Re2.
750,21,33,3h6,b'1r4k1/4Rp1p/p1p3pP/8/p1P5/5K2/5P2/8 b - -',!? With this move White has effectively given up on playing against the Black pawns--now he is clearly just hoping to be able to coax Black off the back rank so White can deliver mate on e8. This is actually a very important move--White could resign here; the game is essentially lost at this point. However setting traps when behind and playing for victory no matter what is part of what makes the game so much fun. White sees a chance for counterplay--no matter how unlikely--and sticks with it.
751,21,34,3Rb3+,b'6k1/4Rp1p/p1p3pP/8/p1P5/1r3K2/5P2/8 w - -',?! Honestly this kind of move just makes me worried. Black's technically still safe because it's check but White is now threatening mate and Black will have to burn another move to prevent it. I would have played 31...f5 just so I wouldn't have to worry about the WR mating me while I queened.
752,21,35,3Kg2,b'6k1/4Rp1p/p1p3pP/8/p1P5/1r6/5PK1/8 b - -',I probably would have played 32.Kf4 (thinking to invade the Black kingside via g5 and f6 after Black plays 32...f5) but this is fine.
753,21,36,3a3,b'6k1/4Rp1p/p1p3pP/8/2P5/pr6/5PK1/8 w - -',??? Black falls into the most nefarious trap of them all! Black misses his safety check for the last time thinking presumably that White ought to be resigning and just intent on getting his Queen and putting the game to rest. In other words exactly what White had hoped to achieve. Spotting his mistake just barely too late Black resigns. Thanks for reading!

As for white there exist multiple ways to respond like 2 Bg5 or the gambits 2 g4 or 2 e4. I even saw a few matches where white decides to smash the Idea of blacks king castling to the king side by starting a pawn storm immediately.

Blacks position is a bit more cramped and in this tournament so far I met two times the move 8 d5 which causes black's knight to loose even more options and the light squared bishop seems to have problems to leave his home.

824,25,9,1Bxf6,b'2r1k2r/pp1qbppp/5B2/1N1p4/8/8/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b k -',This move was in the GK World database and I liked the resulting position. 
825,25,10,1Nxa7,b'2r1k2r/Np1qbp1p/5p2/3p4/8/8/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b k -',So far this position is still in the GK World database and it shows White as having the advantage. 
826,25,11,O-O,b'r4rk1/1p1qbp1p/5p2/1N1p4/8/8/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',It turns out Black's King is not a weak as I would have thought.
827,25,12,Bc5,b'r4rk1/1p1q1p1p/5p2/1Nbp4/8/3Q4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Unexpectedly strong. I thought that with the broken pawn structure Black would fear the ending. But that was not the case.

829,25,14,Ra6,b'5rk1/1p1q1p1p/r4p2/3p4/3Q4/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',! Very effective. While White has to be better (as GK computer indicates) Black has become slightly more active than White. 
830,25,15,2a3,b'5rk1/1p1q1p1p/r4p2/3p4/3Q4/P7/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Necessary to free the rook and block play on the a file.
831,25,16,2Re8,b'4r1k1/1p1q1p1p/r4p2/3p4/3Q4/P7/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Well played. As weak as Black's pawns look I am not able to see how to make much progress.
832,25,17,2Rd2,b'4r1k1/1p1q1p1p/3r1p2/3p4/3Q4/P7/1P1R1PPP/5RK1 b - -',?! This is too timid. Rd3 is better. I thought I could play in later but Black is becoming more active.
833,25,18,2Re4,b'6k1/1p1q1p1p/3r1p2/3p4/3Qr3/P7/1P1R1PPP/5RK1 w - -',A fine move! Black is using activity to compensate for pawn weaknesses.

835,25,20,2Qe6,b'6k1/1p3p1p/3rq3/3p1p2/4r3/P2Q4/1P1R1PPP/3R2K1 w - -',?! GK does not like this move. It suggests … d4 27. Rc2 Qe7 28. Rf1 Kg7 29. h3 Rd5 30. b4 Ree5 31. g3 b5 32. Rfc1 Re1+ 33. Rxe1 Qxe1+ 34. Kh2 further cramping White's position with essential equality.

837,25,22,3Qg3+,b'6k1/1p3p1p/3r4/3pqp2/8/P5QP/1P3PPK/3R4 b - -',Again I still think I have a won ending. While I do have an advantage it isn't as great as I thought.
838,25,23,h6,b'8/1p3p2/3r1k1p/3p1p2/5K2/P6P/1P1R1PP1/8 w - -',! A good plan. Keeping White out.
839,25,24,3a4,b'8/1p3p2/3r1k1p/3p1p2/P4K2/7P/1P1R1PP1/8 b - -',Now I am still struggling for a plan to win rather than draw at the obvious risk of losing. I thought I could mobilize my Q side pawn majority. 
840,25,25,3Rd4,b'8/1p3p2/3rk2p/3p1p2/P2R1K2/7P/1P3PP1/8 b - -',This is the beginning of an aggressive plan. I knew Rooks belong behind pawns but had visions of infiltrating on the Q side.
841,25,26,3b4,b'8/5p2/1pr1k2p/3p1p2/PP1R1K2/5P1P/6P1/8 b - b3',? GK considers this a blunder. I still have the advantage and had a flawed idea that I could advance the pawns now and then get behind a passed pawn with my rook. But GK suggests first 39. g3 Rc8 40. Ke3 Rg8 41. Rb4 Rxg3 42. Kd4 Rxh3 43. Rxb6+ Ke7 44. Kxd5 Rxf3 45. b4 h5 46. a5 Rd3+ 47. Ke5 h4 48. Kxf5 Rd5+ 49. Ke4. The point is that it is a move order issue White could prepare in order to be able to move the K.
842,25,27,4g3,b'8/5p2/1p2k2p/3p1p2/PP1R1K2/5PPP/2r5/8 b - -',? Ironically the best move a move ago GK considers this weak because it gives Black too much play. If I was going to proceed with my plan I needed to be bold and play consistently with 40. a5 Rxg2 41. axb6 Rg8 42. b5 Rb8 43. Ke3 Rxb6 44. Rb4 Kd6 45. Kd4 Rb7 46. Rb3 Rb6 47. f4 h5 with some advantage.
843,25,28,Ra2,b'8/5p2/1p2k2p/1P1p1p2/PR3K1P/5PP1/r7/8 w - -',Now Black has full equality perhaps a very slight edge. But White still is trying for a win. 
844,25,29,4g4,b'8/5p2/1p2k2p/1P1p1p2/PR3KPP/5P2/r7/8 b - -',This move does not help White but it is an attempt to win (or lose).
845,25,30,4Kg4,b'8/5p2/1p2k3/1P1p2P1/PR4K1/8/r7/8 b - -',? The King isn't going anywhere. I was trying too hard to win. GK suggests 48. Kf3 Ra3+ 49. Ke2 Ke5 50. Rh4 d4 51. Rh7 Rg3 52. Rh6 d3+ 53. Kd2 Rxg5 54. Rxb6 Ke4 55. a5 Rg2+ 56. Kc3 Rc2+ 57. Kb3 Ke3 with drawish prospects.
846,25,31,5Rb7,b'8/1R6/1p1k4/1P1p2r1/P7/5K2/8/8 b - -',Again another overaggressive plan which risks losing a drawish game. Best is simply 52. Rf6+ Kc5 53. Rc6+ Kb4 54. Rxb6 Kxa4 55. Rb8 Rg6 56. Kf4 Ka5 57. Ke5 Rb6 58. Ra8+ Kxb5 59. Kxd5 Rh6 60. Ra1 Rh5+ 61. Ke6 Rh6+ 62. Kd5. 
847,25,32,Rg4,b'8/1R6/1p6/1Pkp4/P5r1/4K3/8/8 w - -',? Here Black misses a possible win with … Rg3+ 54. Kf4 Ra3 55. Rc7+ Kb4 56. Ke5 Kxa4 57. Kxd5 Kxb5 58. Rc2 Rd3+ 59. Ke4 Rd1 60. Rc7 Rd2 61. Ke3 Ra2 62. Rd7 Rc2 63. Rb7 Rc1. Again White has played too much for a win.
848,25,33,Rg3+,b'8/R7/1p6/1Pkp4/P7/4K1r1/8/8 w - -',A move later White has better defensive prospects.
849,25,34,Rb4,b'1R6/8/8/1Pkp4/1r6/8/2K5/8 w - -',White is now struggling to draw. 
850,25,35,6Kd3,b'1R6/8/8/1Pkp4/1r6/3K4/8/8 b - -',? But this does not help. GK suggests after 60. Kd3 Rb3+ 61. Kc2 Rxb5 62. Rc8+ Kd4 63. Ra8 Rb7 64. Ra6 Rc7+ 65. Kd2 Rg7 66. Ra4+ Ke5 67. Ra8 Rg2+ 68. Kd3 Rg3+ 69. Kd2 d4 70. Ra7. A similar plan with 60. Kc3 Rxb5 61. Rc8+ Kd6 62. Rd8+ Ke7 63. Ra8 Rb1 64. Ra6 Rd1 65. Rg6 Kd7 66. Rh6 Kc7 67. Rh8 Rb1 68. Rf8 Kc6 69. Rf7 Rb7 70. Rxb7 offers excellent drawing prospects. 
851,25,36,Rxb5,b'1R6/8/8/1rkp4/8/8/3K4/8 w - -',!? This is essentially a concession the game will be drawn.
852,25,37,6Kd3,b'8/8/8/1k1p4/8/3K4/8/8 b - -',! Now White has a draw but they have to play carefully. The rest of the ending is instructive for beginners on how to draw despite being down a pawn from this kind of position. Both players play it out for that purpose.
853,25,38,6Kc3,b'8/8/8/2kp4/8/2K5/8/8 b - -',Always maintain the opposition if the King ever gets in front of the pawn it will Queen.
854,25,39,6Kd3,b'8/8/8/2k5/3p4/3K4/8/8 b - -',The right move Black must now protect the pawn.
855,25,40,6Kd2,b'8/8/8/3k4/3p4/8/3K4/8 b - -',Again maintain the opposition. 
856,25,41,6Kc2,b'8/8/8/8/2kp4/8/2K5/8 b - -',Once again Black must retreat or advance the pawn.
857,25,42,6Ke2,b'8/8/8/4k3/3p4/8/4K3/8 b - -',White is maintaining the opposition. 
858,25,43,7Kc2,b'8/8/8/8/2kp4/8/2K5/8 b - -',Black can't make progress.
859,25,44,7d3+,b'8/8/8/8/2k5/3p4/2K5/8 w - -',Advances the pawn and the same pattern repeats itself.
860,25,45,7Kd1,b'8/8/8/8/3k4/3p4/8/3K4 b - -',The key move. White can oppose Black's king. 
861,25,46,d2+,b'8/8/8/8/8/2k5/3p4/2K5 w - -',Only way to progress but...
862,25,47,7Kd1,b'8/8/8/8/8/2k5/3p4/3K4 b - -',Now the game is declared drawn. Either Black stalemates or loses the pawn a draw in either case. Moral of the game for beginners is if you are too aggressive in trying to win you risk fighting for a draw at best. Also instructive for beginners is how Black compensated for pawn structure weaknesses that were not as severe as one would think with activity. A draw was a fitting result.
863,26,0,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pppbbppp/3p1n2/8/3NPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',"Uncommon move in the opening the main line is O-O.

865,26,2,1Nd5,b'r2qr1k1/pppbbppn/3p3p/3N4/3QPBPP/5P2/PPP5/2KR1B1R b - -',! A quite surprising move because it stops the most annoying move on Black side: Bf6.

869,26,6,2Bd3,b'r3rbk1/ppp3p1/3pb3/5qP1/5B2/3B1P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - -',! The move probably missed because it is always easy to miss retreating moves. Now the King is open and the conclusion is near.
870,26,7,Bf5,b'r3rbk1/ppp3p1/3p2B1/2q2bP1/5B2/5P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w - -',? The better Be7 would have delayed the checkmate by 10 moves or more but this is just suicidal.

902,28,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all! I'm back with a brief look at the next game in this training series in which chicoboy catches me in an overconfident play and makes me pay dearly for it! This game is all about mindset--when you hold all the cards remember that you get to make the threats!
903,28,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',?! I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games simply because it is a fun opening and full of energetic play from both sides.
904,28,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Personally I think this is too passive. White should simply accept the gambit with 3.Nxe5 (or do so a move from now with 3.d4! fxe4 4.Nxe5).
905,28,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black develops a Knight that can be troublesome in this opening and defends e5.
906,28,4,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',As White is continuing to play passively Black develops in an aggressive posture.
907,28,5,Bd2,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Breaking the pin.
908,28,6,Nd5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/3Npp2/1b2P3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Probably a bit inaccurate--moving pieces more than once in the opening is generally a waste of time. Note that this does not actually lose the e-pawn for White: 6...fxe4 7.Nxf6+ Qxf6 8.dxe4 holds just fine.
909,28,7,fxe4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/3Np3/1b2p3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Note how many lines of exchange there are from this position. Nearly every developed piece is looking down one barrel or another. The surprising thing is that none of the lines win any material for anyone.
910,28,8,gxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp3p/2n2p2/4p3/1b2p3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',?! Black wants to keep a strong center pawn mass and open the g-file for Rook play against the White kingside as well but 7...Qxf6 was probably more sound as it gives Black the option to shift the Queen over to g6 and pressure the hard-to-defend e-pawn.
911,28,9,Bxb4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/2n2p2/3pp3/1B2P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',White wants to discourage Black from taking on e4 and losing the right to castle in return though at the current rate the pieces are disappearing Black may not care.
912,28,10,1c3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/3pp3/1n2P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I think this is inaccurate. White is clearly aiming to win the d5 pawn but Black can simply play...
913,28,11,1dxe4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/1n2p3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Now Black has an extra pawn but White's position is a bit more stable. It remains to be seen whether Black can hold onto his advanced center with so few pieces developed to back it up!
914,28,12,1Nd2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/1n2p3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I don't know what I think about this move. White prepares to play Qh5+ and re-energie his development but this still feels a bit passive. 11.cxb4 Qxd1+! (not 11...exf3 12.Qxf3) 12.Rxd1 exf3 13.gxf3 looks a bit more even.
915,28,13,exd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/8/2Pp4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black's center is hugely advanced but it's still unclear whether that's a strength or a weakness! White now has 13.Qh5+! and a complex position develops after 13...Ke7 14.f4 Qd5 15.O-O-O Qxa2 16.fxe5 where Black may have a slight edge but it's hard to see how to capitalize on it.
916,28,14,1Ne4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',? I think this is probably a mistake. White wants to lock up the black center and create some space for his troops but this allows 13...h5! which keeps the WQ in check and gives Black time to develop. 13.Qh5+ immediately was stronger.
917,28,15,1f5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/8/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',? In a rush to push the center Black misses his chance to gain time for development with 13...h5! Allowing the WQ to invade with no pieces to repel her is dangerous at best.
918,28,16,1Qh5+,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/8/4pp1Q/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',! The best move. White's Knight can relocate as needed once he sees where the BK goes.
919,28,17,1Qh6+,b'r1bq1k1r/ppp4p/7Q/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White keeps up the checks. Ideally he'll be able to maneuver the BK to a space where he can retreat the Knight with check keeping ahold of his initiative. Black must play extremely carefully as he has basically no developed pieces with which to defend his King.
920,28,18,1Ke7,b'r1bq3r/ppp1k2p/7Q/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',?? This was played without thinking too hard about it--Black doesn't feel that White's attack is that dangerous. It's not good enough; correct was 15...Kf7 because...
921,28,19,1Qf6+,b'r1bq3r/ppp1k2p/5Q2/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! White spots a devastating combination.
922,28,20,1Kd7,b'r1bq3r/pppk3p/5Q2/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black must stay off the back rank to avoid hanging his Rook.
923,28,21,1Nc5+,b'r1bq3r/pppk3p/5Q2/2N1pp2/8/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',! Finally this Knight is able to jump off e4 with huge effect. White's patience in moving the Knight is about to pay off in spades.
924,28,22,1Ke8,b'r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5Q2/2N1pp2/8/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Forced.
925,28,23,Ke7,b'r1bq3Q/ppp1k2p/8/2N1pp2/8/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',18...Kf7 19.Qxh7+ is no better.
926,28,24,2O-O,b'r1bq4/ppp2k1p/8/2N1Qp2/8/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I think I prefer castling long here lining up the WR with the BQ and keeping the king a bit closer to the action but this is fine. After leaping on Black's inaccuracy White must now simply take his time to consolidate and simplify to a winning endgame.
927,28,25,2b6,b'r1bq4/p1p2k1p/1p6/2N1Qp2/8/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Desperately trying to gain time to develop the Bishop.
928,28,26,2Nxd3,b'r1bq4/p1p2k1p/1p6/4Qp2/8/2PN4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This is best. Eliminating that pawn leaves White free to maneuver and finish off the game.
929,28,27,2Rad1,b'r1b5/p1p2k1p/1p6/4Qp2/8/2Pq4/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Better was 22.Rfe1 threatening a mating attack down the e-file and forcing the BQ all the way back to d8 before playing Rad1 but White's still in a commanding position.
930,28,28,2b3,b'r1b5/p1p2k1p/1p6/4Qp2/2q5/1PP5/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',23.Qh8! wins Black's Bishop after 24.Rd8! This is less strong.
931,28,29,2Rd8,b'r1bR4/p1p2k1p/1pq5/4Qp2/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',Excellent move clearing space on the back rank for the other WR. Black is lost.
932,28,30,2Bb7,b'r2R4/pbp2k1p/1pq5/4Qp2/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',? Incorrect! Black is feeling behind and playing inaccurately but 24...Bd7 was far better keeping ahold of f5.
933,28,31,Ke7,b'r2R4/pbp1k2p/1pq5/5Q2/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',There is actually a rather unintuitive mate in 7 for White here after this move. Black is already done for but that's no excuse for making poor moves!
934,28,32,2Rd5,b'r7/pbp1k2p/1pq5/3R1Q2/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',? It's very hard to blame White for not seeing the mate: 26.Re1+!! Kxd8 27.Qf8+ Kd7 28.Re7+ Kd6 29.Re8+ Kd5 30.Qf5+ Kd6 31.Qe5+ Kd7 32.Qe7# However this move gives up material unnecessarily and *might* just give Black a fighting chance...
935,28,33,2Qxd5,b'r7/pbp1k2p/1p6/3q1Q2/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 w - -',Black's only chance.
936,28,34,2Qxd5,b'r7/pbp1k2p/1p6/3Q4/8/1PP5/P4PPP/5RK1 b - -',?? Nooo White! The Queen trade sort of looks forced at first glance because of Black's nasty threat on g2 but 27.Re1+! leads to several long variations where White will win the BQ in return for the Rook. It's critical in complicated open positions like this one to look for aggressive options instead of instinctively defending. The text hands Black a winning advantage of a Bishop against two pawns.
937,28,35,2Re1+,b'r7/p1p1k2p/1p6/3b4/8/1PP5/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - -',White continues to play well from here but this game is a losing proposition now.
938,28,36,c5,b'r7/pb6/1p3k2/2p4p/2P4P/1P4P1/P4P2/4R1K1 w - c6',Locking up the White pawns on light squares the easier to pick them off with the Bishop. The BK stays on the f file to prevent a Rook from penetrating the position.
939,28,37,Bc6,b'r7/p7/1pb2k2/2p4p/2P2P1P/1P4P1/P7/4R1K1 w - -',Preparing to take control of the e-file (while keeping the King centralized).
940,28,38,3Kh3,b'8/p7/1pb2k2/2p4p/P1P2P1P/1P4PK/4r3/5R2 b - -',Slightly better was 36.Kg1 Rg2+ 37.Kh1 Kf5 though at this point it's irrelevant. Now Black has a mate in seven of his own--an opportunity not missed this time.
941,28,39,3Bg2+,b'8/p7/1p3k2/2p4p/P1P2P1P/1P4PK/4r1b1/5R2 w - -',0-1. White resigns at the impending mate (37.Kh2 Bxf1+ 38.Kg1 Bh3! 39.Kh1 Kf5 40.Kg1 (or 40.a5; the pawn doesn't have time to promote anyway) 40...Kg4 41.Kh1 Kxg3 42.Kg1 Re1#). White found a winning tactic on move 16 but fell prey to a big bluff of an attack from the Black Queen--taking a trade he didn't need to and surrendering all hope of victory as a result. In a dangerous endgame like this one--with a few pawns and several major pieces left on the table--intermediate checks become the name of the game and White getting caught up in a sort of midgame mentality of defending against threats immediately instead of looking for aggressive forcing alternatives was all that it took to allow Black to turn the tides back in his favor. I hope you found something useful to take away from this game. Many thanks to chicoboy for the match and thank you for reading!

Here is another game in GM Cyrano's MT where I have been playing against the big boys this time a Master with a rating close to IM level.  I end up in a position where I have a rook against 2 pieces.  Boy those two pieces proved to be much more lethal than a rook.  In fact all black's remaining pieces swarmed around Henry who sadly got stung and suffered an anaphylactic shock.  So how did this happen.  Well before I start here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17836549&rnd=0.9027691620956812"

970,31,0,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"Strange decision to play this move. For instance all white has to do is to capture on c4 with the bishop and he has already the threat Qb3. The light squared bishop is poorly placed. In this opening we will see that simply following the fundamental(and mistakenly called ""beginner"" or ""basic"") principles we can find the BEST move in each of the positions quickly. Here black should have played ...Nf6 getting the least active piece. I should also note that without any calculation this move is not best The bishop was already active so we shouldn't move it again."
971,31,1,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It's a necessary move to make. Now white should simply castle or play Nc3 but we can also do the move h3 which should be best putting the question to the bishop. 
972,31,2,O-O,b'rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Perhaps castling will put white under an annoying pin but it is only annoying. White probably will not even care if ...Bxf3 ruins the structure since he will be getting bishop pair open file for the rook and a boost in center control. It will suit him fine.
973,31,3,Bd6,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Once again we should have simply played with the least active piece Nf6. Really we can find the best moves in one second if we just use the base principles. Who knows maybe this bishop would like to go to e7. In that case there is an issue of flexibility as well.
974,31,4,Nbd2,b'rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Once again the most active forward move is Nc3 so we should simply do it. 
975,31,5,Nf6,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black has played a good opening but his pieces are not the best in placement and are a bit vulnerable. However we have seen a simple modest development of forces so we cannot make a real criticism.
976,31,6,b3,b'rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/2BP2b1/1P2PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White now needed to play the move of 8.e4 with a good position. If the move of e5 gets to happen a piece will be lost and white will have a permanent space advantage in the kingside(at least for the whole middlegame good for an attack). Not only that black could not even have played move of 8...e5 9.dxe5 Bxe5 10.Bxf7+ and white is simply winning. I should also mention that the move e4 would free the dark squares bishop.
977,31,7,Qc7,b'rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpn2/8/2BP2b1/1P2PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Now black has a great game since white has not taken the key moment. He already has a threat.

It weakens the kingside light squares and is just making too great of a concession on the kingside. At least if a kingside weakening is called for play h3 instead and Bh2+ gives black nothing.
979,31,9,O-O,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2pbpn2/8/2BP2b1/1P2PNP1/P2N1P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Good idea and black already has snatched opening edge at the very least equality.

981,31,11,1Bb4,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1P2b1/1P1BPNP1/P2N1P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Not the best move. It has a clear idea to stop the white development of his dark squared bishop but white can easily stop the idea. He should have simply played Nbd7 then considered a choice break move of e5 probably but c5 could also be possible in some lines.
982,31,12,1Ne4,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1PN1b1/1P1BPNP1/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',White needs to move his piece again to free himself and the move is actually not so bad.
983,31,13,1Nxe4,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1Pn1b1/1P1BPNP1/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',When there is a contact between the pieces we should keep it up unless it gives us a real tactic. Usually releasing the tension gives the opponent activity. Now black has lost his defensive knight on the kingside while white has freed himself nicely. Black should have played Nbd7.
984,31,14,Bh3,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PB3/1P2PNPb/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',It fails to a tactical shot which to white's credit he finds. Many players rated in that area would not be able to find the move.
985,31,15,1Bxh7+,b'rn3rk1/ppq2ppB/2p1p3/8/1b1P4/1P2PNPb/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',The only move and black is now having a major disadvantage in both lines. 
986,31,16,1Kxh7,b'rn3r2/ppq2ppk/2p1p3/8/1b1P4/1P2PNPb/P4P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Even worse for black would have been 13...Kh8 14.Ng5

If you have a good winning move that gives you great advantage and an unclear line(Of course the unclear line is just losing) that simply take the great advantage. I suppose that white expected the move ...Rc8. If white checks it is actually not so clear anymore and white needs to do a SERIOUS calculation. White should simply capture the bishop.
988,31,18,1Bf5,b'rn3rk1/ppq2pp1/2p1p3/5bNQ/1b1P4/1P2P1P1/P4P1P/R1B2RK1 w - -',Of course there is the defense
989,31,19,Bg3#,b'R7/6pk/8/1P6/6PP/P3p1b1/3rp3/4K3 w - -',I don't think the rest of the game needed an annotation-Black slowly converted his advantage.
990,32,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"This is by far the longest game to annotate but it has so many instructive points and is a perfect game between 2 ""average"" rated players on this site."
991,32,1,Qxd5,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black is playing his queen out too early so white can immediately attack it. The Scandinavian Defense is OK but 2...Nf6 is more fundamentally sound.
992,32,2,c6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Typical book line? It is but in the opening we should worry ourselves with the development of the pieces and not play moves like this. Black is simply trying to stall his development but create a sort of position in which white cannot use the development. It is not a fully correct idea and is very difficult to implement since the attack is easier to play for white and black's defense needs to be more carefully played.  3...Nf6 was my best choice.
993,32,3,Bg4,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Again we should have played 5...Nf6 playing a move that MUST be played sooner or later. 
994,32,4,Be2,b'rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White breaks the pin. A fine move but all he needed to do was 6.h3 and followed with 7.g4 kicking the bishop off. Since white has more development it easily compensates for his weaknesses.
995,32,5,a3,b'rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q7/3P2b1/P1N2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',To be honest although this breaks the principles it is actually a decent idea that is in many scandinavian lines. The purpose is to control the b4 square and prevent the black queen and bishop from using it. Also white may play b4 in some lines. I probably would have just castled.
996,32,6,Ne4,b'r3k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbp3/q7/3PN1b1/P4N2/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Good move for white an attacking move so he should put it on high priority.
997,32,7,Qc7,b'r3k1nr/ppqn1ppp/2pbp3/8/3PN1b1/P4N2/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This move is definitely a poor one. As we can see the d6 bishop is the good bishop and it also controls the black's weak dark squares. So now white should take the opportunity and grab the bishop getting an even bigger advantage in the line---10.Nxd6 Qxd6 11.b3 followed by a4 and now the black's weak dark squares will be under the attack. White has a clear advantage here.
998,32,8,1Ng3,b'r3k1nr/ppqn1ppp/2pbp3/8/3P2b1/P4NN1/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White fails to take the opportunity and now his advantage has become very little. One of the best ways to get a good position is to trade your knight for the opponent's bishop especially in the open and dynamic pawn structures. A bishop's activity is by far the most ranged of the pieces. Sometimes it is a big pawn with a hat but at others it is almost equaling a rook in power(13B/14R maximum controls). In the open position bishops are favored but in dynamic structures we can now work on creating a favorable pawn structure.
999,32,9,1c4,b'r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/8/2PP2b1/P4NN1/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq c3',Good idea for white to activate his pawns and they will give him good space.
1000,32,10,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/8/2PP2b1/P4NN1/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',This choice is very risky and I really don't like it too much. It may not be so bad but white has the c4 and d4 pawns attacking towards the queenside. If white can quickly get his queenside attack in black is in big trouble. Certainly a kingside castling was much safer.
1001,32,11,1c5,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/2P5/3P2b1/P4NN1/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',This pawn move lets go of the nice square d5. However it is not bad. White is gaining more space on the queenside and fixing the b7 pawn. Secondly he is forcing the dark squared bishop to an exchange which will weaken the dark squares or to go backwards where it is weaker. White intends to follow with b4 and b5.
1002,32,12,1Bxg3,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/2P5/3P2b1/P4Nb1/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',"Another instructive mistake by black. White gets a clear advantage now. 
Black has traded a key bishop for a weaker knight and his dark squares are so weak after hxg3 and Bf4. White's attack obviously comes first."
1003,32,13,1fxg3,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/2P5/3P2b1/P4NP1/1P2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Very strange. White's intention is to activate his rook immediately but in these types of position it is almost always right to take with the h pawn. Firstly white would need serious justification to weaken the central squares and a major endgame disadvantage. Also white is attacking on the queenside so this makes no sense. Much better was hxg3. However at least white takes back the piece and this mistake is not as serious as the black's last move.
1004,32,14,1Ne4,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2p1p3/2P5/3Pn1b1/P4NP1/1P2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black immediately takes control of the weak square. There is a major problem--It fails tactically. The black queen has only a5 as a safe square and after b4 it will be trapped. So after Bf4 black is in big trouble. That is why ...Nd5 was the best move with a advantage for white but a complex position.
1005,32,15,1Bf4,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2p1p3/2P5/3PnBb1/P4NP1/1P2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Now white is just winning.

1007,32,17,Qd7,b'2kr3r/pp1q1ppp/2p5/2P1B3/3Pn3/P5P1/1P2Q1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black could not save the piece with 17...Qe7 18.Qxe4 f6 19.Qg4+
1008,32,18,1Bd6,b'2kr3r/pp1q2pp/2pB1p2/2P5/3PQ3/P5P1/1P4PP/R4RK1 b - -',OK. So white is a full bishop up and should be winning? Yes but the technical grind is very instructive.
1009,32,19,Rxf2+,b'8/pp1k2pp/2pB1p2/2P5/1P1Pr3/P5P1/5rPP/R4K2 w - -',This is a huge mistake for sure. When losing black needed to play R2e3 and that would avoid the trades. Now everything is easy for white. He will lose one pawn but he has no more problems. By the way black was losing in either line but we should still put up max resistance.
1010,32,20,Rxe2+,b'8/pp1k2pp/2pB1p2/2P5/1P6/P5P1/4rKPP/8 w - -',Another trade makes things easy.
1011,32,21,3h3,b'8/pp4pp/2pB4/2Pk1p2/1P6/P2K2PP/6P1/8 b - -',Black's king is active but it is not very useful. White's idea now is to fix the black pawns on the dark squares.
1012,32,22,3g4,b'8/p5pp/2pB4/1pPk1p2/1P4P1/P2K3P/6P1/8 b - -',White simply needed to take EP and he has a majority and pawws pawn. That would be the easiest win. Now things actually get interesting.
1013,32,23,g6,b'8/p6p/2pB2p1/1pPk4/1P4P1/P2K4/6P1/8 w - -',White's pawns are fixed on the dark squares and black the opposite. This is not what white wants.
1014,32,24,Ke6,b'8/p6p/2pBk1p1/1pP3P1/1P6/P2K4/6P1/8 w - -',And now if black had the ability to pass and not move he would have a draw in this posiiton! Black just needs to put the pawn on a6 keep the king on e6 and he automatically draws! However white can now force the king back with zugswang.
1015,32,25,3Bf4,b'8/7p/p1p1k1p1/1pP3P1/1P2KBP1/P7/8/8 b - -',"White is using the bishop to ""pass"" in the position. "
1016,32,26,3Bc7,b'8/2Bk3p/p1p3p1/1pP3P1/1P2K1P1/P7/8/8 b - -',!!!??? A very strange idea. White only has to use the king to play 29.Ke5 and the win goes easily. If black takes the bishop then he loses both pawns on the kingside.
1017,32,27,3Ke6,b'8/2B4p/p1p1k1p1/1pP3P1/1P2K1P1/P7/8/8 w - -',White simply wasted time.
1018,32,28,4Kf6,b'3k4/7p/p1p2Kp1/1pP3P1/1P4P1/P7/8/8 b - -',White finds the right way to win.
1019,32,29,Kc4,b'8/8/p1p3K1/1pP3P1/1Pk3P1/P7/8/8 w - -',So now the win is trivial. 
1020,32,30,5Qh8+,b'7Q/2P5/8/1K6/6P1/8/1k6/q7 b - -',Black now resigns-A very interesting game.
1021,33,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Reverse Sicilian is one I enjoy as it can play mind games for black and gives different options to white with the extra tempo.
1022,33,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Funny thing is that I immediately try to remove the imbalance of the Sicilian style opening. Removing imbalance as in trying to disrupt opposite dominant sides of the board per player. I see the Sicilian as having good chances for both players.
1023,33,2,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2P5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',Kingside! I had a feeling he would play for the kingside as he previously did in the last blitz game.
1024,33,3,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5p2/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I think 3. ...e4 is an interesting idea.
1025,33,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Not much so far. 
1026,33,5,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p1p2/1bPP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',white may lose a tempo to castle. I think Be2 is a safer move for white.
1027,33,6,Ne4,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/8/3p1p2/1bPPn3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',?? This move feels so natural but is so wrong. Black hangs his own pawn and is underdeveloped. 
1028,33,7,Nxd5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/8/3N1p2/1bPPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Taking the pawn and threatening the bishop. Black should simply move his bishop out of harm's way and accept a less than ideal position.
1029,33,8,Qd6,b'rnb2rk1/ppp3pp/3q4/3N1p2/1bPPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',?? Another bad move spells a disadvantage for black.
1030,33,9,1Bf4,b'rnb2rk1/ppp3pp/3q4/3N1p2/1bPPnB2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',! and now white has a pretty clear victory as black cannot defend the bishop. His a8 rook may also be killed along with the c7 pawn. White just has so many options of obtaining an advantage.
1031,34,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',It's an interesting game I played some time ago actually. Once players start to realize that the queen is worth a limited amount of wood(minor pieces/rooks) their evaluation of that piece drop significantly. However the queen can still dominate the pieces in many occasions. It happens when the greater number of pieces cannot coordinate. 
1032,34,1,a3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2P5/P3P3/1P1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I've actually seen this player use this setup in his other games. One big problem many players have is that they play the same opening setup against all openings even if it is not optimal. I remember that I used to always do the King's Indian Setup without thinking about the opponent. It's a horrible mistake many players make.
1033,34,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2Pp4/P3P3/1P1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Of course to prevent the white knight from developing. 
1034,34,3,Qc2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2Pp4/P3P3/1PQP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Bringing the queen out so early is usually not the best idea. Here it is definitely not best. White easily could have played Nf3 which is definitely going to be played at some point.
1035,34,4,b4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1PPp4/P3P3/2QP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq b3',White is making already 4 pawn moves out of his 5 and is playing this opening kind of like a sicilian Kan variation. The unfortunate thiing is that black has the extra space in the center and has contact between the pawns so the pawn structure is dynamic and black can open it at the right moment. Since white has broken the principles of the opening black can also do it if he wants.
1036,34,5,a5,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/5n2/p3p3/1PPp4/P3P3/2QP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq a6',Creating of a weakness. 
1037,34,6,Bc5,b'rnbqk2r/1pp2ppp/5n2/pPb1p3/2Pp4/P3P3/2QP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',Now the c5 square is no longer controlled so the bishop goes there easily.
1038,34,7,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp2ppp/5n2/pPb1p3/2PpP3/P7/1BQP1PPP/RN2KBNR b KQ -',White wants to quickly close up the position where his lack of development will not be so bad. Black should open things up on the queenside because the center is impossible to open. I should say that even if the position would be completely closed up black would still be much better since the white's pieces are all misplaced.
1039,34,8,Qb6,b'rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/1q3n2/pPb1p3/3pP3/P2P4/1BQ2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQ -',Now black just has a clear advantage since he has accomplished the goals he wanted to.

However I was very proud to discover this move and the idea behind it. It simply looks like a blunder at first sight since white can gain material getting of the 2 rooks for queen. Howeverblack has a strong idea in mind. Definitely an exclamation.

1046,34,15,b5,b'5nk1/5ppp/q3bn2/pp2p3/3pP3/3P4/1B1NBPPP/1R3RK1 w - b6',Black is simply realizing the plan.

I had playing my previous moves in only a few seconds and after playing this one a quick calculation made me realize that I had just blundered one of my passed pawns. Now I had to slow down and start being more careful. A real wake up! Instead black wins more material by force after 29...a4 when both of the white's bishops are suffocating.

In conclusion the evaluation of the game shifted in my favor in the early stage then came back a bit to white but I managed to grab the wheel again and was back to a winning advantage.

On a serious note i'm a much too inconsistent player to hang with stronger players so i feel this was quite the achievement to draw it out with a player of such caliber. I feel as though i had an advantage with those center pawns and i was hoping someone could assess my play here because i do feel like i let the win slip away from me.

I would try a more open and active response to 1. e4 perhaps e5 or c5.

1136,38,5,1Bh6,b'2rq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnpB/8/4P3/1NN2P2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R b KQ -',the idea is to exchange the DSBs  as soon as posible  .
1137,38,6,Qb6,b'2r2rk1/pp2pp1p/1qnpbnpQ/8/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP1B1PP/R3K2R w KQ -',good move  the  black queen takes active position on the a7-g1 diagonal  avoides 0-0avoids active moves whites Nd4 after Rd1 or 0-0-0 and makes more room to the other rook to join the game .
1138,38,7,1O-O-O,b'2r2rk1/pp2pp1p/1qnpbnpQ/8/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP1B1PP/2KR3R b - -',its can be dangerous for white king  to stay on the center there for  white must 0-0-0 its the only option he have  however black can destroy his pawn structure on the queen side and expose little bit the white king .
1139,38,8,Qa5,b'2r2rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1npQ/q7/4P3/1PN2P2/1PP1B1PP/2KR3R w - -',good move  the black queens is like a white sharks who smells blood of an injoured prey and going to strike  the black take advantage of the exposed white king and the weakness of the whites queen side and bring his queen to the open A file and threats unpleasnd check on a1  its looke not so good for white now .

1141,38,10,1Nb4,b'2r2rk1/pp2pp1p/3p1npQ/q7/1n2P1P1/1PN2P2/1PP1B2P/2KR3R w - -',good move  15...Qb1+.16.Nb1-Nb4.17.c3 and i don't have something special however 15...Nb4!makes more effect on my threat Qa1+.for example 16....Qb1+.17Kd2-Qxb2!(17.Nb1-Rxc2+) and white in deep trouble. the idea of Nb4 is to open some kind of a pine on the whites Nc3 because of if the white knight will move the c pawn will die and maybe so as his king .
1142,38,11,Nd7,b'2r2rk1/pp1npp1p/3p2pQ/8/1n2P1P1/1P1B1P2/1PP4P/qNKR3R w - -',good move  the idea is to manoeuvre the knight to e5 and makes strong pressure on d3. and the problem for white is that it seems that he doesn't a wear of his dangerous situation  and  don't pay attention on whats happening on his back Yard.
1143,38,12,Rxc4,b'5rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2pQ/4n3/1nr1P1PP/1P3P2/1PP5/qNKR3R w - -',very nice  combinatioan that i saw  the capturing of the black rook will leads to strong mate attack which force white to give back material with more . 
1144,38,13,Nxc4,b'5rk1/pp2pp1p/3p2pQ/8/1nn1P1PP/5P2/1PP5/qNKR3R w - -', and white resigns  for the reason that now black simply threats 21...Qxb2#and Na2# there for 22.Rd4-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxd4+ and white without a piece and lose the game  if.22. Rde1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxc2# or if 22.Rdg1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxc2+.24.Ke1-Nd3+.25.Kf1-Qf2# . its hopeless position for white  thank you and hope you enjoyed the game .
