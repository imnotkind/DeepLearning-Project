This game explores how the tactic deflection is used to win material.  In this game it wins heavy material as a result of one player throwing pieces into the mix as a hopeful middlegame mating attack ensues.  Will it be King Henry or King Richard who will end up under the cosh here?  You will have to read on.  GA is below: -"

This will then leave King Richard and his remaining sentries at the mercy or otherwise of Henry and Glenda.  The alternative is to have the white rook up against Glenda and Glenda 2 - not a pleasant prospect!  King Richard sees that any further attempt at continuing the battle will be futile and lets his sword fall to the ground - just like the white king in Harry Potter's Philosopher's stone movie.  I hope you all have had a good read and there will be one more annotation to follow based on tactics very soon.  Kind regards - Joanne

In our WTW&LR club, Julio (easy-win) decided to take me on - brave one!

1039,39,31,5fxg5+,b'8/8/pK3k2/P5P1/6p1/2P3P1/7P/8 b - -',"56. fxg5+ - there is no saving the pawn on a6 and Glenda making a re-appearance on a8.  Julio sees this and waves the white flag.  Solid play from Julio up until he left his e6 pawn en prise.  When you are down on pawn material in an endgame it pays to keep at least a piece on to give you some drawing chances.  I hope you have all had a good read and there will soon be another annotation coming up, this one will feature tactics in the middlegame which will net heavy material."
