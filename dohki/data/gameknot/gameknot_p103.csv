0,0,0,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Al and I have had a running argument over the French for about 20 years now. Against 1. e4 he plays other defenses so seldom they're not even worth mentioning and his knowledge of the various lines of the French is almost encyclopedic. In other words when we have this little argument he's usually the one who wins.
1,0,1,Nd2,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The Tarrasch variation is a more positional treatment than the sharper Winawer variation with 3. Nc3.

183,10,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Sicilian. The theory behind this opening is notoriously deep; I'm not going to go into it very much.
184,10,2,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the Canal–Sokolsky Attack also called the Moscow Variation. 
185,10,3,Nd7,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',3...Nc6 and 3...Bd7 are more common but there's nothing wrong with this move.
186,10,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/1Bp5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Good solid thematic move.
187,10,5,Ngf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/1Bp5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black invites some very sharp play.

While there's nothing obviously wrong with this move--it doesn't lose material or anything--the Knight is badly misplaced on g4 and can be driven away at White's leisure with a gain of tempo with moves like 7.Ng5 setting up 8.e6. Best was 6...Ne4 building pressure on the Nc3 (which was the whole reason for playing 5...Qa5+).
190,10,8,O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3p4/qBp1P3/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Probably 7.Ng5 was stronger but this is fine.
191,10,9,b6,b'r1b1kb1r/p2npppp/1p1p4/qBp1P3/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?? This error is as subtle as it is deadly. By blocking b6 Black has cut off his Queen's retreat path and now there's suddenly no way at all to save her! 8.Nd2 (also threatening the undefended Ng4) followed by 9.Nb3 wins the BQ outright with no chance of escape! She could try to run to b4 but then 11.a3 keeps her trapped and she'll have to move again to gain more than a pawn for her life.
192,10,10,exd6,b'r1b1kb1r/p2npppp/1p1P4/qBp5/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',The line I gave above was better but this is still fine blowing open the BK's cover. Look how much better White's position feels even though material is basically even: the BQ is useless and on the verge of being trapped for good and none of Black's minor pieces are doing anything useful either. White's minor pieces on the other hand are all actively placed and contributing to the threats on the board.
193,10,11,a6,b'r1b1kb1r/3npppp/pp1P4/qBp5/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',8...e6 was better. Now White has the chance to break through the center with the advanced pawn and Nd5 after playing 9.Bc6 to get the Bishop out of danger (with tempo!)
194,10,12,1a4,b'1rb1kb1r/3npppp/ppBP4/q1p5/P2P2n1/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k a3',? Simply put it's hard to see a reason for this move. White still has a much better position but this pawn push does nothing to advance his goals. Much better was 10.Nd5 threatening Nc7+ adding pressure to e7 as well as threatening to trap the BQ with 11.Bd2.
195,10,13,1exd6,b'1rb1kb1r/3n1ppp/ppBp4/q1p5/P2P2n1/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k -',? That pawn was a thorn to be sure but opening up the King like this is an invitation for disaster. Now White's 11.Nd5 comes with even more potent threats as the King no longer has any defenders (and Re1 is on the way as well as the other threats I already mentioned). Black needed to play 10...cxd4 instead to let his Queen out of her miserable little corner.

It forces Black to put his Knight in a better position--hardly what White wanted to do here! 11.Nd5 was certainly best threatening all manner of checks and threats (Nc7+ Re1+ Bd2...).
197,10,15,1cxd4,b'1rb1kb1r/3n1ppp/ppBp4/q7/P2p2n1/2N2N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w k -',! Black finds the correct intermezzo here gaining time to free his Queen and allowing his Knight to relocate to the strong e5 post.
198,10,16,Be7,b'1rb1k2r/3nbppp/ppBp4/q3n3/P2N4/2N4P/1PP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w k -',? Black wants to castle and rightly so but this doesn't get it done because White still has too many threats. Better was 13...Qc5 where the threat of entrapment is gone and the Queen can finally be of some use tying down the White pieces to defending one another.

The general case of the rule is simple: when behind don't exchange!! Better was probably 15...Kf8 or maybe 15...f6 seeking to get the King out of the center any way possible.
203,10,21,1Bd2,b'1r5r/1b1nkppp/ppBp4/q3n3/P2N4/7P/1PPB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',? But White misses his own combination! As I mentioned above this was a good threat several moves ago but now that Black's c-pawn is gone the Queen can't be trapped this way. Best was to pick up the free Bishop with 16.Bxb7.

His mobility should have allowed him to continue with several powerful threats (indeed 17.Nf5+ Kd8 18.Bxb7 Rxb7 19.Be3 Qmoves 20.Nxd6 wins a pawn and an exchange with no counterplay for Black) but getting too tricky has led him to drop a piece instead.
205,10,23,1Bxe5,b'1r5r/3nkppp/ppqp4/4B3/P7/7P/1PP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',? Now it is White's turn to make trades at the wrong time: he is down a full piece at this point; he shouldn't be making exchanges. Perhaps 19.Bg3 threatening 20.f4 would have been better.
206,10,24,2c3,b'1r5r/3nkppp/ppq5/4p3/P7/2P4P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',Trying to stop the bleeding and allow the Queen to get into play.

208,10,26,Nc5,b'1r5r/4kppp/p1q5/Ppn1p3/8/2P4P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - -',21...b4 was stronger taking advantage of the queenside minority to force trades. The text hangs the e-pawn and gives White back the initiative.

210,10,28,Qc7,b'3r3r/2q1kppp/p3n3/Pp2R3/6Q1/2P4P/1P3PP1/2R3K1 w - -',This just invites White to put his Rc1 on e1 where it belongs. I like 24...Rhe8 better in preparation for ...Kf8 to get out of the pin.
211,10,29,2b4,b'3r3r/2q1kppp/p3n3/Pp2R3/1P4Q1/2P4P/5PP1/2R3K1 b - b3',?? White misses the threat and the rest is history.
212,10,30,2Qh4+,b'3r3r/4kpp1/p3n3/Pp2q2p/1P5Q/2P3PP/5P2/2R3K1 b - -',?? 27.Qh3 was called for (though 27.Resigns was playable). Now Black has his own chance to trap a Queen but unlike White he jumps on it immediately.

Not a perfect game by any means but certainly interesting to see all the tactical opportunities that sprang up as early as move 6! Well played by both sides and well worth a close look at all the middlegame maneuvering. We saw both sides make poor choices that would have been strong at another time: a good reminder that every single chess position is different. What was strong last move may be fatal now!

My buddy Bob Jacobs drew my attention to a victory he had obtained against a player of near-IM strength.  In fact he is currently an IM.

It just shows Masters are human and they make chessic howlers but they are not Masters for nothing - it is very rare that they do make oversights.  Bob should still take credit for this victory - first he must spot the hanging piece.  He must then decide whether it is a sacrifice or a mistake.  Firstly he must look at his king and check that he is not in Old Matey's shadow or that if he does take the hanging material he will not then cop Old Matey.  He must also ascertain that after the capture his opponent does not have any other riposte or positional counterplay.  Black had none whatsoever and so having just a pawn for his queen resigned on the Grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material even though his opponent is 800 points south of him - it was just too much.  Anyhow another known Master has slipped up big time and he will be joining Bob on my It Can Be Done Thread.  See you soon - Joanne

It certainly does that but in the exchange of White's B and N for Black's R and P Black gets the better of the bargain in terms of the greater flexibility and mobility.  At Master and Expert level this would be a mistake; at Grade level - perhaps 'dubious' is a better description.  Knowing how to make best use of these advantages is the trick and in my view it is worthwhile at some early stage in one's development to try out this kind of exchange and discover for oneself the 'truth and consequences' of this decision.  
353,16,13,Rxf7,b'r1bq2k1/ppp2rpp/1bnp1n2/6N1/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Correct.  Black realises that although he loses a major piece (and a pawn as well) the two minor pieces are likely to be worth more.  It's certainly better that allowing White to get away with a pawn for nothing.
354,16,14,Kxf7,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/1bnp1n2/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',The King is not seriously discommoded by this move to f7.  If the need arises he can always duck back to g8.
355,16,15,1d5,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/1bnp1n2/3P4/4P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',With both his centre pawns attacked White had little choice but to gain time this way to protect them both.  The drawback is that Black gets the e5 square for his knight.  Later Black finds a use for the c5-square as well.
356,16,16,Bg4,b'r2q4/ppp2kpp/1b1p1n2/3Pn3/4P1b1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Already it seems to me the advantage of the minor pieces is apparent.  Look at Black's development!  He must already have been thinking in terms of a direct K-side attack.
357,16,17,Qe7,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/1b1p1n2/3Pn3/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Possibly heading for e5 which will be vacated by the Knight betimes.  Possibly 13...Qd7 came into consideration as well.
358,16,18,1Bg5,b'r7/ppp1qkpp/1b1p1n2/3Pn1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Probably hoping to relieve the pressure by exchanges?
359,16,19,1h6,b'r7/ppp1qkp1/1b1p1n1p/3Pn1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',(!) Fine!  It is often the case that the best time to play this sort of pawn advance is when you can a tempo by hitting a minor piece with the prospect of an aggressive advance by the g-pawn subsequently.  This sort of thing isn't always good but when it is it is very strong.  Now if the Bishop retreats Black has gained some momentum for a K-side attack.
360,16,20,1Bxf6,b'r7/ppp1qkp1/1b1p1B1p/3Pn3/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',(?!)  Had White tried to retreat Black would have got a strong attack after 15.Be3 Nf3ch!!  16.gxf3 Bxf3  17.Rfc1 Ng4  18.Bxb6! (essential now with ...Bxe3 threatened) 18...Qh4 (...Qe5 has the same idea in mind)  19.Kf1 Qxh2  20.Ke1 cxb6  21.Nd1 Re8! 
361,16,21,1gxf6,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1b1p1p1p/3Pn3/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Though the GK engine mislikes this move there is a lot to be said for it in my view - in particular the g-file that is opened up for Black's lone rook.  But taking with the Queen would have given that piece a lot of options subsequently.  Gameknot suggests 15...Qxf6 (already threatening ...Nf3ch)  16.Ne2 Nf3ch! (anyway!  This move is very thematic in this game hereabouts)  17.gxf3 ... (17.Kh1 Qh4!) 17...Qxf3  18.Qc3 Qxe2.  At this point a clear bishop pair for a rook ahead Black would have had much the better of the game.
362,16,22,1h3,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1b1p1p1p/3Pn3/4P1b1/2N4P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',(??)  This is the first really bad mistake of the game.  So far White has been under some pressure as a consequence of his decision to go in for a R+P vs B+N game.  But this pawn push weakening as it is ought to have had a worse outcome than it did...
363,16,23,1Bh5,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1b1p1p1p/3Pn2b/4P3/2N4P/PPQ2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',(?) Understandably Black thought he had to pull back the Bishop after which White gets back onto level terms.  Instead 16...Nf3ch (that move again!) 16.gxf3 ... (No use to White is 16.Kh1 Qe5!) 16...Bxf3  17.Rfc1 ...(looking for a bolthole for the King)  17...Rg8ch  18.Kf1 Qe5 with all kinds of threats.  E.g. [A] 19.a3 (?; a 'nothing' move to demonstrate one idea) 19...Qh2! (19...Rg1ch is almost as good) 20.Ke1 Rg1ch  21.Kd2 Qxf2ch  22.Ne2 Qxe2ch  23.Kc3 Qe3  24.Kc3 Qe3ch with a winning attack; but  [B] 19.Ke1 Qd4  and Black's pieces are far too active for White to expect to live much longer.
364,16,24,1Kh1,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1b1p1p1p/3Pn2b/4P3/2N4P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K b - -',(!) At last getting his King into safety and neutralising Black's Dark-square bishop.
365,16,25,1Nd7,b'r7/pppnqk2/1b1p1p1p/3P3b/4P3/2N4P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K w - -',Regrouping.  Given the attack has been repulsed pretty much it shows commendably flexible thinking.  All the same there was a lot to be said for 17...Rg8.
366,16,26,1Na4,b'r7/pppnqk2/1b1p1p1p/3P3b/N3P3/7P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K b - -',Black's Bishop having been a considerable nuisance on b6 White decides he would be better rid of the thing.
367,16,27,1Nc5,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1b1p1p1p/2nP3b/N3P3/7P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K w - -',Not a bad move.  He might have distracted White into exchanging on c5 whereat Black keeps his bishop pair; or else the knight wins for himself a useful outpost square.
368,16,28,1Nxb6,b'r7/ppp1qk2/1N1p1p1p/2nP3b/4P3/7P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K b - -',Not to be deterred decoyed or distracted.
369,16,29,1cxb6,b'r7/pp2qk2/1p1p1p1p/2nP3b/4P3/7P/PPQ2PP1/R4R1K w - -',(!?) Interesting strategic decision.  Ordinarily one would expect Black to Capture 'towards the centre' - especially in view of the state of his pawns already.  But Black anticipates the c-file will be useful to him.  He is counting on his pieces to win the game.  In this he might have been over optimistic.  White is quite soundly placed now.  Probably 20.f3 would have consolidated his pawns and left Black a very difficult task even to stay on level terms.  Instead White tries something more aggressive but also more loosening of his position.
370,16,30,2g4,b'r7/pp2qk2/1p1p1p1p/2nP3b/4P1P1/7P/PPQ2P2/R4R1K b - g3',(?) If he didn't like 20.f3! he might have had a crack at 20.e5!? dxe5  21.Qh7ch Ke8 22.Qxh6 and White's counterplay (according to the GK engine) might well be good enough to draw.
371,16,31,2Bg6,b'r7/pp2qk2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/7P/PPQ2P2/R4R1K w - -',But now Black has a triple attack on e4 with a Bishop fork on the King and Queen threatened.
372,16,32,2f3,b'r7/pp2qk2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PPQ5/R4R1K b - -',Apparently stopping the threat...
373,16,33,2Qe8,b'r3q3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PPQ5/R4R1K w - -',(?) Another regrouping in mind but Black could have snaffled the e-pawn here whose protection is less solid than it looks: 21...Nxe4!  White would not have dared take the Knight on account of 22.fxe4 Bxe4ch winning White's Queen.  Nor would 22.Rfe1 have been any use as with 22...Ng3ch 23.Kg2 Bxc2  24.Rxe7ch Kxe7  25.Kxg3 Rc8  (26.Rc1 Bf5!) the extra piece should win for Black.
374,16,34,2Rae1,b'r3q3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PPQ5/4RR1K b - -',Now e4 is sufficiently protected.  Also possible was 22.Rac1 with 23.b4 in mind.  If then 22...Nxe4  23.Qc7ch and White wins the Knight on e4.
375,16,35,2Rc8,b'2r1q3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PPQ5/4RR1K w - -',Reopening the threat ...Nxe4.
376,16,36,2Qb1,b'2r1q3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/2nP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1Q2RR1K b - -',Probably the best White has.  If say 23.Qd2 then 23...Nxe4 was possible with the idea 24.fxe4 Bxe4ch  25.Kg1 Rc2 and now [A] 26.Rxe4 Qxe4; [B]  26.Qxh6  Rg2ch  27.Kh1 Rxg4ch!  28.Kh2 Rg2ch   29.Kh1 Re2ch!  30.Kg1 Qg8ch game over.
377,16,37,2Qb5,b'2r5/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/1qnP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1Q2RR1K w - -',Unable to find a way through White's line of entrenchments Black goes around.
378,16,38,2Rec1,b'2r5/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/1qnP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1QR2R1K b - -',Pinning the Knight...
379,16,39,2Re8,b'4r3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/1qnP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1QR2R1K w - -',...Unpinning.  In so doing once again Black threatens a breakthrough at e4.  White's position is under a great deal of pressure especially upon the e4-point and it is quite hard having only heavy pieces available for White to find the means to relieve the strain.
380,16,40,2Kg1,b'4r3/pp3k2/1p1p1pbp/1qnP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1QR2RK1 b - -',Obviates the K-Q fork after ...Nxe4; fxe4 Bxe4ch.  It is hard to see that White had anything better available.
381,16,41,2Re7,b'8/pp2rk2/1p1p1pbp/1qnP4/4P1P1/5P1P/PP6/1QR2RK1 w - -',Arming himself against surprises along the second rank.  Circumspection - for good or ill - seems to be a feature of Black's play in this game.  However attempted aggression by 25...Nxe4 (hoping for 26.fxe4 Bxe4  27.Qa1 Qd3) would have come unstuck by 26.Rc7ch or 27.Rc7ch.  By playing as he has Black now threatens 25...Nxe4 for real once more.  
382,16,42,Nd7,b'8/pp1nrk2/1p1p1pbp/1q1P4/4P1P1/2R2P1P/PP6/1Q3RK1 w - -',Another redeployment back to e5.  Black has directed a lot of his play very effectively about the central dark squares.  Though his tactics have been less than optimal his positional feel looks pretty good to me.
383,16,43,2Rfc1,b'8/pp1nrk2/1p1p1pbp/1q1P4/4P1P1/2R2P1P/PP6/1QR3K1 b - -',Hoping the open file will yield something...

This is the turning point of the game as up to here White has been more or less holding his own.  With 28.Qc2 - trebling the pieces on the c-file - he might have found enough counter-play to cause Black to wonder how he was going to make any more progress.
385,16,45,2Nxf3+,b'8/ppR1rk2/1p1p1pbp/1q1P4/4P1P1/5n1P/PP6/1QR3K1 w - -',(!)  This is one of those situations in which there is more than one good move available.  The text is obvious and obviously fine; but equally effective would have been 28...Qe2!

Now from an objective point of view Black did indeed have a winning game here.  It seems likely that Black has a forced mate after 35.Kf2 though it's not easy to find given the wealth of possibilities e.g. this 'sample' line: 35...Ne4ch  36.Ke1 Qg3ch  37.Ke2 Qf2ch  38.Kd3 Nc5ch  39.Kc3 Qf3ch  40.Kd2 Qf4ch  41.Kd1 Qf1ch  42.Kd2 Ne4ch  43.Kc2 Qe2ch  and now [A] 44.Kb1 Nd2ch  45.Ka1 Nb3ch  46.axb3 Qa6#; or [B] 44.Kb3 Qd3ch  45.Ka4 Nc5ch and White has to give up his Queen to avert mate.  More clear cut perhaps is 35.Kf4 but Black has to find 35...Qe2!  36.Rg8ch (the only move to save mate) 36...Be8  37.Qe3 ... (a counter-threat!) 37...Nd3ch  38.Ke4 Nf2ch  39.Kd4 Qxb2ch and now White exchanges Queens: 40.Qc3 Qxc3  41.Kxc3 Nxh3 and White's chances have almost disappeared.  Having looked at all this it has to be said that it would have been Black's task to find the winning lines and in my view White would have had every right to test Black's technique.  Here's a good rule: NEVER TRUST YOUR OPPONENT.  Never trust him to make a bad move; but never trust him to make a good one either.  Note that 'trust' does not mean 'assume'.

I am getting to the end of Master Chrisobee's Amor Vincit Omnia (Love conquers all) mini-tournament and I was paired with an Expert called Ningshih.  It was a very closed game and Ningshi had a big task breaking through it.  She did manage to breach the walls slightly by launching a combo which won a pawn.  This directly resulted in a single rook and pawn ending.  However Henry and my rook managed to hold the fort and Ningshih could not make any further headway whatsoever and accepted my draw offer on move 54.  After my difficult game and loss against Coach Ion I was really thrilled to have this boost and give my fellow Walk The Walkers hope for the future.  So how did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17636006&rnd=0.8220917387966657"
550,22,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',1. ..... c5 - Sicilian Defense.

558,22,9,1a3,b'1r3rk1/4qpp1/2nppb1p/p1p5/2P1P3/Pp1PNN2/1P2QPPP/1R1R2K1 b - -',18. a3 - stage 2.

560,22,11,2Rcc1,b'r4rk1/5p2/2np1q1p/2p1p1p1/p1P1P3/Pp1P1N1P/1P1Q1PP1/1RR3K1 b - -',25. Rcc1 - not a lot doing but at least I can make moves which do not compromise my position.  It is more a case of wait and see.
561,22,12,2Kg2,b'r6r/5pk1/2np2qp/2p1p1p1/p1P1P1P1/Pp1P1N1P/1P1Q1PK1/1RR5 b - -',28. Kg2 - Henry moves to this square to prepare for a WR to come to h1 to counter the threat on the h column.

563,22,14,Nf4,b'r6r/5k2/3p1pq1/2p1p1pp/p1P1PnP1/Pp1P1N1P/1P1Q1P2/3K2RR w - -',33. ..... Nf4 - so a black knight is placed on a very active square and passivitis sets into the white camp.  But can black inflict anything worse on me?  Remember if you can move just one piece to one square to avoid losing material or making any other concession - your opponent cannot put you in a zugzwang!
564,22,15,3Kc1,b'r6r/5k2/3p1pq1/2p1p1pp/p1P1PnP1/Pp1P1N1P/1P1Q1P2/2K3RR b - -',34.  Kc1 - I do feel that Henry is a little safer on the queenside than on the kingside with the pawn formation blocked up.  Glenda my knight and the rooks are keeping a close eye on the d3 pawn and the kingside.
565,22,16,3hxg4,b'r6r/5k2/3p1pq1/2p1p1p1/p1P1PnP1/Pp1P1N2/1P1Q1P2/2K3RR b - -',35. hxg4 - at last black initiates a pawn trade which opens up the h file and she now prepares to double rooks on it.
566,22,17,Rh8,b'7r/5k1q/3p1p2/2p1p1p1/p1P1PnP1/Pp1P1N2/1P3P2/2KQ2R1 w - -',37. ...... Rh8 - so black does not double rooks on it but there are two major pieces on it.  Maybe it would have been better if the Witch had gone behind the rook but that would have taken a lot of messing about on black's part.  Nonetheless I feel this order will be crucial to my kingside defense later on.
567,22,18,Ke7,b'7r/4k2q/3p1p2/2p1p1p1/p1P1PnP1/Pp1P1N2/1P1K1P2/5QR1 w - -',39. ..... Qe7 - black does a lot of manouevering though - with her king!
568,22,19,Qh3,b'7r/3k4/3p1p2/2p1p1p1/p1P1PnP1/Pp1PKN1q/1P3P2/4Q1R1 w - -',41. ..... Qh3 - at last black declares her hand.  A nasty pin on my f3 knight is on the cards.  Glenda now offers her life for that of the Witch.
569,22,20,4Rxf1,b'7r/3k4/3p1p2/2p1p1p1/p1P1PnP1/Pp1PKN2/1P3P2/5R2 b - -',43. Rxf1 - one of the invaders is traded off but there is still a black rook to reckon with.
570,22,21,Ke6,b'8/8/3pkp2/2p1p1p1/p1P1P1P1/Pp1P1N1r/1P2KPn1/3R4 w - -',45. ........ Ke6 - black moves her king to get me into a material losing zugzwang.  I can do nothing about this but looking at the board and the pawn formations gives rise to the thought that I can afford to lose a pawn here despite my opponent being 300+ rating points above me (remember that my 1950 rating is inflated!) - I simply dare to believe that as the BK may not be able to penetrate into my position Henry and my rook will be able to handle the black rook and prevent any further damage.
571,22,22,4Ke2,b'8/8/3pkp2/2p1p1p1/p1P1P1P1/Pp3r2/1P2KP2/6R1 b - -',49. Ke2 - Henry immediately puts the question to the black rook which incredibly has only one square to go to - h3!
572,22,23,5Rd1,b'8/8/3pkp2/2p1p1p1/p1P1P1P1/Pp5r/1P2KP2/3R4 b - -',50. Rd1 - at least this rook momentarily puts pressure on d6 and ties the BK down to defending it.  However black can attack my g4 pawn because I cannot afford to defend it with f3?? because this will allow a rook skewer on h2 winning the critical b2 pawn.
573,22,24,5Rg1,b'8/3k4/3p1p2/2p1p1p1/p1P1P1Pr/Pp6/1P1K1P2/6R1 b - -',52. Rg1 - nothing else but at least Henry has the squares e2 and d2 to oscillate from.

My opponent sees that there is no way through the Joblock and rather than take a risk like Freddy did in my draw game and hand me back a pawn to try and penetrate down the kingside bit the bullet.  While I would rather have been up and at em' like Master Blaster Ineedaname there is something really satisfying about preventing my Expert opponent from beating me - that is a victory in itself.  At the moment I am carrying on Master Freddy's work - challenges between players with huge rating differentials.  Eventually these challenges although they may seem disheartening at first to have to deal with the heavy material losses and/or copping Old Matey standards in play of these lower rated players will gradually and eventually improve until the walkers become runners!

This could be my very last game against The Coach.  I was hoping it would end on a fairly high note for Yours Truly but alas it wasn't to be.  Of what was intended to be a de-cramping exchange of bishops turned out to be something completely different.  Because Glenda was on the same line as Ion's dsb Ion was able to take advantage of this by exchanging his rook for two of my pieces.  This exchange proved to be as disastrous as it could be and the end was almost comical - my rook was trying to evade Ion's swarming pieces but it was all in vain and I ended up resigning on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  So how did this happen?  You can follow the game with this link. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18375546&fb=1&rnd=0.12734190257427663"
576,23,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq d6',1..... d5 - Ion chooses to kick off with the Reti Opening and I played the standard response to it.

The a pawn where it stands becomes a target for Ion's dsb later on.  The bishop move indirectly bears down on Ion's rook on f1.

It would take a few moves before that diagnoal is opened and in that time I could have got Glenda to safety.

Ion then described his pieces as soldier ants swarming over my rook and warned me that my rook was running out of safe squares.  Two moves later my rook was trapped and I then resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  I played this game very badly but Coach Ion must take credit for the awesome way he manoeuvered his pieces to induce me to concede a ruinous amount of material.  Well played there.  At least I will soon have a much better game against an Expert to annotate.  This time I manage a draw .....

658,27,12,2Rf3,b'2r3k1/3qpp2/pp3bpQ/3p4/4n3/BP3R2/P5PP/4R2K b - -',Black should contest the c-file with Rc1 instead of trying to mate on h7 which is impossible because of Ng5 or simply moving the king to f8 after Qh7+.

On the one hand it invites Black to bottle up his forces with 9...c6 making development slightly more difficult. On the other hand it doesn't accomplish a whole lot and Black's QN frequently ends up aiding on the kingside via d7 anyway so this check may not accomplish much of anything.
698,29,9,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2npb1/2p4p/3pP1p1/B2P1p2/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',I always feel especially daring castling kingside in this opening.

712,29,23,2Bxd5,b'r2q1rk1/3n4/4P1bp/pp1B2p1/3N1p2/P1P5/1P1B1QP1/2K4R b - -',...but time pressure makes fools of us all. This looks strong--grabbing a pawn and compounding the threats against Black's position by striking at the Rook and threatening 26.e7+! winning the BQ as well. But Black has a little more time on the clock--enough to find an effective resource. 25.exd7 etc was better and simpler.
713,29,24,2Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/8/4P1bp/pp1Bn1p1/3N1p2/P1P5/1P1B1QP1/2K4R w - -',In the face of the multiple threats on the table this move isn't obvious--until you notice that the Bd5 is undefended. That fact largely neutralizes the available threats and while White will still come out better than he was it's nowhere near the strong position he would have had by just taking the Knight. Now not only is Black threatening the Bishop but his Knight also leers down at d3 ready for a royal fork if given the opportunity.
714,29,25,2e7+,b'r2q1rk1/4P3/6bp/pp1Bn1p1/3N1p2/P1P5/1P1B1QP1/2K4R b - -',This is still White's best option I think.
715,29,26,Rxf8,b'5rk1/8/6bp/pp1qn1p1/3N1p2/P1P5/1P1B1QP1/2K4R w - -',At this point the players are basically equal in material and have less than a minute on their clocks but Black's positional advantages are huge he's still threatening ...Nd3+ and the WK is suddenly looking pretty exposed. What is White to do?
716,29,27,2Qe2,b'5rk1/8/6bp/pp1qn1p1/3N1p2/P1P5/1P1BQ1P1/2K4R b - -',Innocuous-looking but I think this actually loses due to the WK's perilous positioning. White had to deal with the potential fork but I think the right way to go about it was by hiking the King back towards the kingside with 28.Kd1. Certainly he's still in some serious trouble but (time pressure aside) he might be able to play to a draw from here if he's careful and gets some good counterplay on the kingside. As it stands I don't see a direct win but Black certainly has a strong play...
717,29,28,2Qa2,b'5rk1/8/6bp/pp2n1p1/3N1p2/P1P5/qP1BQ1P1/2K4R w - -',"0-1. Here White timed out looking for a response. The best move looks to be 29.Kd1 where I think White has enough outstanding threats to keep Black from clamping down on a mate thanks largely to the heroic Nd4. There are several variations after 29.Kd1 but the gist of them all is that as long as the Nd4 controls b3 and c2 Black can't finish the mate and he'll have to back off after maybe winning a pawn or two in order to defend his own King.

Many thanks to romcyte54 for some very enjoyable games; I only regret we didn't get to see this one through to the end. Comments are much appreciated and thanks for reading!"

Master X is a very strong player and I have copped Old Matey from her in quite a few of her games.  However Master X was to slip up in this game and allow a powerful mating attack and material winning sacrifice and give hope to all players under 2000 that beating them is not an impossible task.  You just have to capitalise on any error that they make when you are aware of it.  Ineedaname was aware of it and had done the necessary checks for king safety before making the sacrifice that prompted resignation on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material after white went for the jugular.  So how did this happen?  Well here is the game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18603742&fb=1&rnd=0.3053444196581168"
789,31,1,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. ..... Bb5 - the Ruy Lopez.

794,31,6,1cxd4,b'r2qrbk1/1bp2pp1/p1np1n1p/1p6/P2PP3/5N1P/1PBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - -',14. cxd4 - after a lot of subtle manouevering comes a pawn trade.  White has an impressive looking pawn centre but can white capitalise on this?
795,31,7,1Bb1,b'r2qrbk1/1bp2pp1/p2p1n1p/1p6/Pn1PP3/5N1P/1P1N1PP1/RBBQR1K1 b - -',15. Bb1 - white does not want his bishop traded off for black's knight.
796,31,8,1d5,b'r2qrbk1/1b3pp1/p2p1n1p/1ppP4/Pn2P3/5N1P/1P1N1PP1/RBBQR1K1 b - -',16. d5 - pawn wedge but can it last?
797,31,9,axb5,b'r2qrbk1/1b1n1pp1/3p3p/1p1P4/1np1P3/R4N1P/1P1N1PP1/1BBQR1K1 w - -',18. .... axb5 - opening up the a file.
798,31,10,2Rg3,b'r3rbk1/1b3pp1/1q1p3p/1p1PnN2/1np1P3/6RP/1P1N1PP1/1BBQR1K1 b - -',21. Rg3 - putting g7 under the hammer and tying Master X's dsb down to defending it.
799,31,11,2Nf3,b'r3rbk1/1b3p2/1q1p2pp/1p1PnN2/1np1P3/5NRP/1P3PP1/1BBQR1K1 b - -',22. Nf3 - bringing up reinforcements on the weakened castled position.
800,31,12,2Bxh6,b'r3rbk1/1bq2p2/3p2pB/1p1P1N2/1np1P3/3n1NRP/1P3PP1/1B1QR1K1 b - -',24. Bxh6 - hallo hallo hallo we are about to have an exchange sacrifice to open up a vital line.
801,31,13,2Nf3h4,b'r3rbk1/1bq2p2/3p2pB/1p1P1N2/1np1P2N/6RP/1P3PP1/1B1Qn1K1 b - -',"25. N3h4 - nasty nasty nasty.  On analysis black will get nearly enough material for his queen but his king will be dangerously exposed.  Gameknot analysis gives white's advantage as +2.79 but Master X thought the deficit big enough to resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  White played very well in this game and showed great ingenuity in his mating attack.  It just shows it can be done!

802,32,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I was expecting to go into a Petroff (like in round 4) as that was my main opening at that time but my opponent decided to deviate from the usual 2.Nf3.
803,32,1,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The only reasonable move in this position in my opinion.
804,32,2,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',?! Apparently White played 2.d4 without knowing the theory or he just accepted an inferior position for some surprise value to his opening. Either way 3.c3 the Danish Gambit is better.
805,32,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',This way Black gains a tempo on the queen and forces it to move again either blocking one of White's bishops retreating to an awkward square (a4) or undeveloping.
806,32,4,Qd1,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White chose the latter although I like 4.Qe3 better as it at least keeps White somewhat active and also prevents 4...Bc5 as also indicated by the opening theory (as far as there is any on this position).
807,32,5,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Preventing me from taking on e4 immediately but I guess a simple 5.Nc3 was better because this gives me some tactical possibilities.
808,32,6,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/6B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',As mentioned earlier 4.Qe3 prevents ...Bc5 so probably I should have played that here. It would also threaten ...Bxf2+! and if Kxf2 then ...Nxe4+ wins back the piece with a huge advantage for Black. This was also suggested by a club mate (rated 1700) with whom I analysed this game afterwards (I'll call him G). However my move also threatens something...
809,32,7,Nc3,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/6B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',?! ... Which White misses. 6.f3 was the only way to retain material equality although it's an awkward move to make.
810,32,8,Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n5/6B1/4n3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',! This combination wins a pawn for Black.
811,32,9,Bxe7,b'r1bqk2r/ppppBppp/2n5/8/4n3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Or 7.Nxe4 Bxg5.
812,32,10,Ne2,b'r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4q3/8/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',? this move is just bad. 9.Be2? fails to 9...Qxg2 but 9.Qe2 is better. Maybe White was reluctant to play that because the queen exchange would favour me being the side with a material plus (although the rest of the game shows that he was probably not aware of that rule).
813,32,11,d5,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/8/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq d6',? Here I should have played 9...Nb4! as also suggested by G. Because 10.Rc1 fails to 10...Nxa2 11.Ra1 Nb4 and we have the same situation minus a White pawn on a2 the only way to defend c2 is 10.Kd2 depriving White of castling rights and giving me other tactical possibilities due to my better development and White's awkward king placement. My move is more positionally oriented but not bad either.
814,32,12,1c3,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/2P5/PP2NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',?! Understandable to defend d4 and b4 but this is just asking for another knight manoeuvre...
815,32,13,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/2P5/PP2NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',... But again I choose the more slow and positional way. However 10...Ne5 was very strong. The computer comes up with this continuation: 11.Qd4 Nd3+ 12.Kd2 Qxd4 13.Nxd4 Nxf2 and this is obviously winning for Black being two pawns ahead. Notice that White is forced to move his queen (or h1 rook but that piece doesn't have any decent squares) as otherwise 11...Nd3+ followed by 12...Nf2 forks king and rook. (There is actually one other line which avoids that namely 11.f3 Nd3+ 12.Kd2 and now I have to retreat my queen (12...Qg6 say) but that's obviously not pleasant for White either.)
816,32,14,1Rc1,b'r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/2P5/PP2NPPP/2RQKB1R b K -',? This makes ...Ne5 even stronger.
817,32,15,1Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/2P5/PP2NPPP/2RQKB1R w K -',? Apparently I was just not looking at those possibilities carefully enough. Again a simple 11...Ne5 wins easily as now ...Nd3 already forks king and rook..
818,32,16,1Qc2,b'r1b1r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/4q3/2P5/PPQ1NPPP/2R1KB1R b K -',?! Again not the best. White is proposing a queen exchange while he is behind in material. He should really really focus on developing his other forces Whiile defending d3.
819,32,17,1Bf5,b'r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p1b2/4q3/2P5/PPQ1NPPP/2R1KB1R w K -',?! I wanted to play 12...Qxc2 13.Rxc2 Bf5 which is clearly better as it wins a tempo on the White rook but somehow I reversed the move order. I was just not fully concentrated in this phase of the game.
820,32,18,Bg6,b'r3r1k1/ppp2ppp/2n3b1/3p4/8/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/2R1KB1R w K -',I had been looking at this line at move 12 but I had already seen that 14...Bd3?! would lose a pawn to 15.Rd1 Bc4 16.b3 (which G missed at first). That was the reason why I preferred 12...Qxc2 over 12...Bf5 and the reason why I had to play 14...Bg6 here.
821,32,19,1Nd4,b'3rr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n3b1/3p4/3N4/2P2P2/PP3KPP/2R2B1R b - -',I don't like this as it just isolates White's d-pawn (and there is nothing to gain from the open  c-file for White). Moreover it proposes another exchange of pieces. I guess White was not aware of the fact that piece exchanges generally favour the side with extra material.
822,32,20,Rd7,b'4r1k1/pppr1ppp/6b1/3p4/3P4/5P2/PP3KPP/2R2B1R w - -',17...c6 seems such an obvious move that I had almost played it instantaneously (and G had also expected me to play it) until I realised that there were other possibilities as well. This move has the dual purpose of defending c7 (and with that the seventh rank as well) and preparing to double up rooks.
823,32,21,1g4,b'4r1k1/pppr1ppp/6b1/3p4/3P2P1/5P2/PP3K1P/2R2B1R b - g3',At first G thought that White would win an exchange with 18.Bb5 but I simply respond with 18...c6. That the computer gives it as best in my view demonstrates White's lack of possibilities. The continuation given by the computer is (18.Bb5 c6) 19.Rhe1!?> Rxe1 20.Rxe1 Kf8 (I can't take 20...cxb5?? due to the back rank mate) but this is another piece exchange which I would have been glad to accept.
824,32,22,1Kg3,b'4r1k1/ppp1rppp/6b1/3p4/3P2P1/5PK1/PP5P/2R2B1R b - -',Marching up on the kingside maybe trying to trap my bishop on g6. Still White is unable to develop his remaining forces as there's  no useful square for the bishop and the rook.
825,32,23,1c6,b'4r1k1/pp2rppp/2p3b1/3p4/3P2P1/5PK1/PP5P/2R2B1R w - -',Necessary anyway to defend the seventh rank before infiltrating with my rooks.
826,32,24,Re8e3,b'6k1/pp3ppp/2p3b1/3p4/3P2P1/4rPK1/PP1R3P/4rB1R w - -',?! Looks nice but it's not best. I was planning ...Bd3 but as I'll show later it's still not possible after this.
827,32,25,f5,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p3b1/3p1p2/3P2P1/4rP2/PP1R1K1P/4rB1R w - f6',22...Bd3?? (which was G's first thought as well) fails to 23.Bxd3! Rxh1 (or 23...Rxd3 24.Kxe1) 24.Kxe3. (Not 23.Rxd3?? Rxf1+! 24.Kxf1 Rxd3). The computer suggests 22...Re7 but I didn't want to admit that 21...R8e3 was a mistake yet.
828,32,26,2Bg2,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p3b1/3p1p2/3P2P1/4rP2/PP1R1KBP/4r2R b - -',The only way for White to untangle is by exchanging more pieces.
829,32,27,2h3,b'6k1/pp2r1pp/2p3b1/3p1p2/3P2P1/5P1P/PP1R1K2/7B b - -',A useless move.
830,32,28,2fxg4,b'6k1/pp2r1pp/2p3b1/3p4/3P2P1/7P/PP1R1K2/7B b - -',Why not 26.hxg4 (or what was the purpose of 25.h3 if you don't take with the h-pawn here)? This frees the bishop but it will just be exchanged which is again good for me.
831,32,29,2Be4,b'6k1/pp2r1pp/2p5/3p4/3Pb1P1/7P/PP1R1K2/7B w - -',OK but I actually played this too quickly.
832,32,30,2Re2,b'6k1/pp2r1pp/2p5/3p4/3Pb1P1/7P/PP2RK2/7B b - -',I had actually overlooked this pin but I have a resource to save myself.
833,32,31,2Rf7+,b'6k1/pp3rpp/2p5/3p4/3Pb1P1/7P/PP2RK2/7B w - -',The check saves me and allows for yet another exchange.
834,32,32,Kf8,b'5k2/pp3rpp/2p5/3p4/3P2P1/7P/PP2R3/7K w - -',G suggested 29...Rf1+ but after 30.Kg2 I don't see what I have achieved. I wanted to get my king involved. I also looked at 29...Rf3 30.Kg2 Rd3 but White would infiltrate on the seventh rank and it's not necessary to allow that. If I can just keep White's counterplay under control my extra pawn will eventually be enough to win.
835,32,33,Re7,b'5k2/pp2r1pp/2p5/3p4/3P2P1/7P/PP2R1K1/8 w - -',Proposing an exchange...

838,32,36,3Rf7+,b'4k3/pp3rpp/2p5/3p4/3P2P1/5K1P/PP3R2/8 w - -',He seemed surprised by this move and after the game he told me that this was the moment at which he realised he was lost. Apparently he did know that pawn endings with a pawn less are generally lost. This one is no exception.
839,32,37,Ke7,b'8/pp2k1pp/2p5/3p4/3P2P1/7P/PP3K2/8 w - -',A nice suggestion by G was 34...g5 which immediately stalls all play on the kingside for White. This moves wins as well though.
840,32,38,3b4,b'8/pp4pp/2pk4/3p4/1P1P2P1/5K1P/P7/8 b - b3',He is trying to stop ...c5 but he won't be able to stop it forever. F'ritz suggests 36.h4 c5 37.Ke3 b5 but that's an easy win for me as well.
841,32,39,3b6,b'8/p5pp/1ppk4/3p4/1P1P2P1/5K1P/P7/8 w - -',Sticking to my plan of playing ...c5 but the computer prefers 36...Kc7 then 37...Kb6 and push the pawns on the queenside.
842,32,40,3Kf4,b'8/p5pp/1ppk4/3p4/1P1P1KP1/7P/P7/8 b - -',37.Ke3 holds out longer but White is dead lost anyway.
843,32,41,3bxc5+,b'8/p5pp/1p1k4/2Pp4/3P1KP1/7P/P7/8 b - -',The computer prefers 38.h4 but I would first stall White's kingside play and then play ...cxb4 manoeuvre the king to White's a-pawn take it and march up the b-pawn a simple and effective plan.
844,32,42,3Ke3,b'8/p5pp/3k4/2pp4/3P2P1/4K2P/P7/8 b - -',I don't understand Fritz' suggestion 39.dxc5 Kxc5 because after 40.Ke3 Kc4 my d-pawn cannot be stopped from promoting.
845,32,43,h6,b'8/p5p1/3k3p/3p4/3K2P1/7P/P7/8 w - -',Somewhat more accurate is 40...g6 when White's in zugzwang one move earlier than in the game.
846,32,44,4h4,b'8/p5p1/3k3p/3p4/3K2PP/8/P7/8 b - -',Just making some tempo moves before moving his king but Black has enough moves to force White to give up the opposition first.
847,32,45,a5,b'8/8/3k3p/p2p2pP/P2K2P1/8/8/8 w - -',And White has to move his king so he resigned. He actually thought that he would not be able to stop the d-pawn. He is able to: 45.Kd3 Kc5 46.Kc3 d4+ 47.Kd3 Kd5 48.Kd2 Kc4 49.Kc2 d3+ 50.Kd2 Kd4 51.Kd1 Ke3 52.Kc1 d2+ 53.Kd1 but then Black creates two passed pawns on the kingside after 53...Kf4 ...Kg4xh4xg5 which will decide the game. An instructive game to show how one pawn can make the difference. I think White actually played a good game considering his rating but one early tactical mistake cost him.
