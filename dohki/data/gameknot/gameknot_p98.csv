42,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',The King's Pawn Opening.
43,2,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',In this position his goal is to develop his DSB.  However this is out of book but it's still playable.
44,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',However I am also determined to develop. 
45,2,3,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Now he gets a good fianchetto.  Although feasible it is also unusual to get a fiachetto this early.  In fact I have not seen where someone fianchettos a bishop by move 2.
46,2,4,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I am still going to develop.  Note: I was planning to play this game as if it were a Guaco Piano eventhough I know that it is far from it.  In fact I realize that it will never become a Guaco Piano or Ruy Lopez but it does not matter.  My only goal is to play those types of moves so that I will not overwhelmed by an opening out of book.  In addition this move pins his f7 pawn.  Afterall that is part of my weak area.  I wonder however how do you become familiar with something that is out of book or that you are not accustomed to?
47,2,5,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',So he continues with development and is prepared to castle.
48,2,6,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',In the meantime I decide to develop my other Knight because you are supposed to get your pieces out ASAP.
49,2,7,e6,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',I don't know why he played this.    
50,2,8,O-O,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',So I castle and he responds by castling as well.
51,2,9,d3,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',My goal is to develop my DSB in this position without wasting time.  That's why this move was played as opposed to 6.b3.  However best was 6.d4 as this move blocks my LSB.  This time however it is not as much of a problem given that this is the only time that my LSB will move.  Therefore I will not have to waste any time.
52,2,10,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pbp/2n1pnp1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',He continues to develop.
53,2,11,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pbp/2n1pnp1/6B1/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',And I do the same thing by pinning his f6 Knight.
54,2,12,h6,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pb1/2n1pnpp/6B1/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Although the pin looks like a mistake as it is supposed to lose tempo.  That's not the case here.  Why?  Kicking my DSB is not going to benefit his position because he does not get anything out of it.  Afterall it does not lose material so getting kicked around the board does not bother me.  As we will see I retreat my DSB while keeping his Knight pinned.  Then he will kick it again only to break the pin.  If I were black I would not attack material just to break a pin.  
55,2,13,Nh5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pb1/2n1p2p/6pn/2B1P3/2NP1NB1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I do not know why made this move.  The only thing I see is that a Knight on the rim is grim.  However that is only a small detail.  You can't base a position around that.
56,2,14,1Nxg5,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1pb1/2n1p2p/6Nn/2B1P3/2NP2B1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',?? I figured that I had won a free pawn not seeing his h5 pawn.  Therefore this is the losing blunder as it gives away a piece for a pawn.  In addition this move will result in a King exposure after I am done exchanging material.
57,2,15,1Re1,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1pb1/2n1p2p/6q1/2B1P3/2NP2P1/PPP3PP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I do not know what I was thinking at this point.  In this position I thought that my rook was in danger but am completely wrong.
58,2,16,1Bd4+,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/2n1p2p/6q1/2BbP3/2NP2P1/PPP3PP/R2QR1K1 w - -',So he does not waste any time to place me in check.  I could get out of check in three ways with 13.Kh1 13.Kf1 or 13.Re3.  However 13.Re3?? just gives away a free rook and 13.Kh1 exposes my King even worse.  Therefore best is 13.Kh1.
59,2,17,Ne5,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/4n1q1/2BbP3/2NP2P1/PPP3PP/R2QR2K w - -',In this position he is only interested in exchanging my LSB for his e5 Knight because he knows that I am behind.  However I have other plans that are almost worthless.  What are they and why am I planning something so obvious? 
60,2,18,1Nb5,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N2n1q1/2BbP3/3P2P1/PPP3PP/R2QR2K b - -',"This is it.  My only goal is to win his c7 pawn and threaten with 15.Nxc7.  Normally I do not make obvious threats as was discussed in my game against youthanasia66.  However this is quite different because I know that the game is lost no matter what I do.  Afterall black-cat-hamelet would say ""The only time playing badly would ever be of any use is if you are losing anyway and try a strategy you know can fail in the hope that your opponent falls for the trap.""  This is one of those times."
61,2,19,1Bxb2,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N2n1q1/2B1P3/3P2P1/PbP3PP/R2QR2K w - -',So he takes advantage by winning my b2 pawn and essentially threatening to exchange my a1 Rook for his LSB.  However I sort of knew that my strategy would fail given that this was similar to a cheapo tactic.  I also knew that the game was lost so my only goal is to distract him so that I can stay in the game a little longer.  My goal is actually working.  Why?  If I hadn't tried something so obvious (had not played 14.Nb5) I would have resigned at this point.  On the other hand Jack Stockel has told me not to resign immediately.
62,2,20,1Rb1,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N2n1q1/2B1P3/3P2P1/PbP3PP/1R1QR2K b - -',So I decide to protect my Rook by shooing away his DSB.
63,2,21,1Ng4,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N4q1/2B1P1n1/3P2P1/PbP3PP/1R1QR2K w - -',At first I had no idea why he played this.  However I quickly figured out that his goal is to set up a mating sequence with his remaining Knight and Queen.
64,2,22,1Qe2,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N4q1/2B1P1n1/3P2P1/PbP1Q1PP/1R2R2K b - -',Therefore I have to prevent this so I decide to bring out my Queen out at last.  Note: this is not too early as all the other pieces have been developed.  In addition he knows my weakspot so I have to do whatever I can to protect my King and Queen.  BTW that is the only thing stopping me from taking his DSB.  Because if 16.Rxb2?? 16...Nf2+ winning my Queen with his Knight fork.
65,2,23,1Be5,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N2b1q1/2B1P1n1/3P2P1/P1P1Q1PP/1R2R2K w - -',Therefore he retreats.  If he cannot win more valuable material or mate (therefore to succeed with a deflective sac) why would he be willing to give away a piece?
66,2,24,1d4,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N2b1q1/2BPP1n1/6P1/P1P1Q1PP/1R2R2K b - -',?? So I go for brokes (anything) by reattacking his DSB.  As it turns out however this move will end the game quickly as we will see.  Either way however I do not mind because I already know that the game is lost.
67,2,25,1Bxg3,b'r1b2rk1/pppp1p2/4p2p/1N4q1/2BPP1n1/6b1/P1P1Q1PP/1R2R2K w - -',At first At first I viewed this as a mistake as this gives away a piece for a pawn.  As it turns out however this move seals my fate.  Why?  After I retake he places me in check.  Then a mate in one is inevitable.  After 18...Qh5+ this will happen 19.Kg1 (forced) 19...Qh2#.  As a result I resign after 18...Qh5+.

However this is offset by Whites strong knight on e5. Bd6 is another good development and best met by Re1 and then after Black castles White can attack the knight by Bg5 and threaten to double Black kinside pawn.

Better is to immediately play Bd6 or else the more aggresive Nh5 to attack the f4 bishop."

105,3,36,1Bh2,b'r3rk2/3qbppp/p1p5/3p3n/Q2P4/2N4P/PP2RPPB/4R1K1 b - -',White defends the Bishop. Also interesting is Be5 which Black will probably counter with Bf6 to seek exchanges. 
106,3,37,1f5,b'r3rk2/3qb1pp/p1p5/3p1p1n/Q2P4/2N4P/PP2RPPB/4R1K1 w - f6',Black aggresively advances the f pawn. But this move reduces his king safety and Black does not have good attacking prospects so this move is likely a mistake. He is planing f4 locking the White dark square bishop out of the game. I prefer the simple Nf6.
107,3,38,2Qc2,b'r3rk2/3qb1pp/p1p5/3p1p1n/3P4/2N4P/PPQ1RPPB/4R1K1 b - -',White moves the Queen to the c2 square where she is well positioned as she influences the kingside. The move prevent the advance f4 as Qxh7.

114,3,45,2Rae8,b'4rk2/1q2r2p/p1pB2p1/3p1p1n/N2P4/7P/PPQ2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Black brings the rook over to the e line ready to recapture.

120,3,51,2Qd8,b'3qrk2/4r2p/p1pB2p1/2Np1p1n/PP1P4/7P/2Q2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Black defends cleverly. Now Ne6+ forking king and queen is not as strong as it might seem as Black will regain material and have two rooks against the White queen.
121,3,52,2Rxe7,b'3qrk2/4R2p/p1pB2p1/2Np1p1n/PP1P4/7P/2Q2PP1/6K1 b - -',White exchanges a set of rooks.

127,3,58,3Nc5,b'4k3/7p/2pq2p1/2Np1p2/PP1P1n2/7P/2Q2PP1/6K1 b - -',White also improves his knight position and allowes the a pawn to advance.
128,3,59,3Kf7,b'8/5k1p/2pq2p1/2Np1p2/PP1P1n2/7P/2Q2PP1/6K1 w - -',Black moves his king off the open e line. Kc8 is impossible due to Nb7+ forking the queen and king. But I think better is the more aggresive Qf6 attacking the d4 pawn and threatening Qg5 and trying to attack the White king.
129,3,60,3Qd2,b'8/5k1p/2pq2p1/2Np1p2/PP1P1n2/7P/3Q1PP1/6K1 b - -',White improves the queen position defending the weak d4 pawn and also attacking the Black knight reducing the movement of the Black queen which defends the knight.
130,3,61,3Ne6,b'8/5k1p/2pqn1p1/2Np1p2/PP1P4/7P/3Q1PP1/6K1 w - -',Black allows a exchange of knight. Black hopes to exchange knights and then play for perpetual check. This is the best way to defend a Queen ending when you are behind by one pawn in material.
131,3,62,3Qh6,b'8/5k1p/2pqn1pQ/2Np1p2/PP1P4/7P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',A very strong move. Blacks king safety is poor and White finds a way to take advantage of this. White threatens Qxh7+
132,3,63,3Kg8,b'6k1/7p/2pqn1pQ/2Np1p2/PP1P4/7P/5PP1/6K1 w - -',Black defends the pawn with the king. Nxd4 loses to Qxh7+ and then Qxh8+ and then capturing the black knight on d4.
133,3,64,3Qe3,b'6k1/7p/2pqn1p1/2Np1p2/PP1P4/4Q2P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',White improves his Queen positions taking control of the e line. White threatens Qxe6+.

135,3,66,3a5,b'6k1/7p/2pq2p1/P1Np1p2/1P1P1n2/4Q2P/5PP1/6K1 b - -',White advances the passed pawn. White has a winning advantage.

Many years ago I played an OTB game for Cambridge City Chess Club against Brandon King's Gambit Chess Club.  It was a home match.  I had played Kevin in a few previous matches one where I was in an ending of opposite colour bishops and I lost because I overlooked a removal of the guard combo another where I learned my lesson and did not fall for that trick twice and went on to draw.  Here the opposite bishop scenario did not occur and the position appeared to be even right to the endgame where he made one slip up and it cost him dear.  Here is how it all happened ...."
144,4,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',1. ..... d5 - it all started with the Scandinavian (Centre Counter) Defense which is quite playable although the Wicked Witch of the West can get chased around quite a bit!

Mind you - the BK did not castle until move 13 and Henry seems safe enough.  However I make my final decision of where I want Henry to be next move.
155,4,12,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1n1pp1/2p5/q3p2p/3P4/1QP2NP1/PP3PP1/2KR3R b - -',19. 0-0-0 - Queenside.

This knight move also defends the pawn on g3 and the pawn on g2 is defended X-ray fashion by Glenda!  So this puts the question to the Wicked Witch of the West.  Trade herself off for Glenda or get out of my pos!
159,4,16,2Kxc2,b'2kr3r/pp1n1pp1/2p5/7p/3PN3/2P3P1/PPK3P1/3R3R b - -',24. Kxc2 - Kevin trades her off and this trade helps me because it brings Henry closer to the centre for the endgame.

170,4,27,4gxf5,b'8/p7/1p6/3k1Pp1/PP6/5K2/8/8 b - -',47. gxf5 - I come out of that little stouche with material even and both sides have a passed pawn on the kingside.  Alas for Kevin Henry is closer to the g5 pawn than the BK.
171,4,28,Kf6,b'8/p7/1p3k2/5Pp1/PP4K1/8/8/8 w - -',48. ..... Kf6 - forced if he wants to avoid letting that f pawn march on to Glendadom.
172,4,29,b5,b'8/p7/5k2/Pp3Pp1/1P4K1/8/8/8 w - -',49. .... b5?? - this is the move which is gonna cost black the game.  I now play a6 and put Kevin in a zugzwang.  Kevin must now move his king away from the protection of the g5 pawn and Henry wastes no time in devouring his favourite seafood two moves down the line.
173,4,30,5f6,b'8/p4k2/P4P2/1p4K1/1P6/8/8/8 b - -',52. f6 - my passer must be pushed.

Henry will move to g7 next move and this will enable Glenda to appear in a puff of smoke.  First on her to-do list will be to keep the BK confined to the kingside and then Henry will be close by to aid her when it comes to driving the BK to the edge of the board to administer that kiss of death.  I hope you have had a good read - kind regards - Joanne

223,7,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',My favourite reply.   Sicilian players tend to dislike it although it's becoming better-known.   It does tend to lead to significantly different games to the more usual lines.
224,7,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I think 2. ... d5 is slightly ahead in the popularity stakes at the moment but this is perfectly playable.

228,7,7,cxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Still standard although there's been a trend as far as I can see towards not taking this pawn (maybe more so in the 2. ... d5 lines).   The text frees c3 up for the knight which plays into white's hands.   Leaving the pawns in situ just makes it a bit more difficult for white to develop.
229,7,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',No rush to take the pawn as 5. ... dc hangs the knight (although black gets two pawns; I've only seen it played once and after building up a nice attack I screwed up and lost...)
230,7,9,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',5. ... Nc6 is more common here but it all transposes.

236,7,15,dxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/4p3/3P4/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Still all book.
237,7,16,d5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The first non-obvious move of the opening; white sacs a pawn to try prise open black's position.   White has nothing after 9. de QxQ+ 10 BxQ e6.
238,7,17,Na5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Standard.
239,7,18,1Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White ignores the threat to the bishop instead looking to gain time for the attack.   If 10. ... NxB 11. QxN and white's focus is still on the same diagonal.
240,7,19,1Bg4,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/6b1/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',!?   A novelty for me anyway.   Now white has to choose between doubled b-pawns or f-pawns (the only other alternative 11. Bc2 seems a bit too defeatist - it gives up on the a2-g8 diagonal and forces white into an entire change of plan all while a pawn down).   In the World database on gameknot this move has been played just 18 times compared to 172 times for 10. ... NxB.   It has a significantly better success rate for black too.   On the face of it I don't understand why this move isn't played more often.
241,7,20,1Be3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/6b1/1BN1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',So I go for development.
242,7,21,1Bxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1BN1Bb2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Black swaps.   On the world database 11. ... NxB was played in each of the six occasions this position was reached.   On the gameknot database 11. ... NxB was played in each of the four occasions this position was reached.   Again I don't see any particular reason for this discrepancy.   Maybe black's just unnecessarily giving up the bishop pair here.
243,7,22,1Qxf3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1BN1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',12. PxB is the preferred recapture on gameknot (this swap coming after NxB on the other side of the board).   I don't see what white has from that other than a long struggle to hold a draw and indeed black has won on four of five occasions.
244,7,23,1Nxb3,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/3Pp3/8/1nN1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Black swaps.

246,7,25,1g6,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1n4p1/3Pp3/8/1PN1BQ2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Developing the bishop.   Maybe this is why 11. ... BxN isn't as popular; with the LSB on the board black could play e6 here with the option of continuing with dxe BxP.   Instead 13. ... e6 now looks awkward for black and white gets to use the time to bring up more reinforcements.
247,7,26,1O-O,b'r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1n4p1/3Pp3/8/1PN1BQ2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',I castle - often delayed in the c3 Sicilian but it's the right time now.   A rook is going to come to d1 to back up the pawn.
248,7,27,1Bg7,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/1n4p1/3Pp3/8/1PN1BQ2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Black's ready to castle; the bishop could be quite dangerous on that diagonal too.
249,7,28,1Rad1,b'r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/1n4p1/3Pp3/8/1PN1BQ2/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b kq -',The first gripe from gameknot analysis.   I wanted to back up the pawn and get the rook out of the bishop's sights.   GK wants me to push straight away - 15. d6 ed 16. Rfd1 d5 (white's going to get the pawn back anyway; if not this one then the b-pawn it seems) 17. NxP NxN 18. RxN Qf6 19. Qe4 O-O and black has to swap off to avoid infiltration on the seventh.

255,7,34,1d6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1nppbp/p2P2p1/4p3/8/BPN2Q2/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',So here we go.   Cat among the pigeons time!   Isolated pawns need to be pushed into the opposition's position anyway so this is natural.
256,7,35,1e6,b'r2q1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2Pp1p1/4p3/8/BPN2Q2/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',Black opts to push instead of take; I think 18. ... ed 19. BxP Re8 20. QxP is ok for white who's got his pawn back at least; the threat is 21. Ba3 and the black knight is lost.   19. RxP ganging up more directly on the pinned knight seems to allow black time to defend b7.
257,7,36,1Qxb7,b'r2q1rk1/1Q1n1pbp/p2Pp1p1/4p3/8/BPN5/1P3PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Material equality restored.

A. The KGA Modern defense can not be played generally.
B. The King is perfectly fine on f1 unlike most people might tell you.
C. You don't really lose a tempo because Black has to move the queen back at some point in fear of getting trapped on the kingside and becoming a tempo punching bag.
D. It isn't really played much so it has the fun of not being over analyzed like 3. Nf3 was.
E. It's fun to laugh at the ""you always have to castle"" notion. 
f. It'll make you smile so it is worth your while.

422,12,2,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3Pp1B1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',White ensures that the board stays open for his Bishops.

424,12,4,Qb6,b'r3kb1r/pp1b1ppp/1qn2n2/1B1pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',? Not as strong as it looks. It appears at a glance that Black has guarded against White's threats and safely escaped the pin but this actually does lose a pawn: 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Nxd4! where Black cannot take the Bishop after all: 10...Qxb5?? 11.Nc7+ wins the Queen.
425,12,5,1a3,b'r3kb1r/pp1b1p1p/1qn2p2/1B1pp3/8/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',? This move is meant to give an escape space to the LSB (on a2) and foreshadow a queenside attack but it really just doesn't get much done. Best was 10.Nxd5 as I mentioned above.

I also told him that this was not the best as it crams his DSB.  So he will have to waist time to bring it out later on.  @flutie39: Better was 2...Nc6 or 2...Nf6 in this position.

It was actually from a previous annotation by one of the commentators.  That annotation however involved my game against aluke42.  Later on cdeburca told me that d4 is usually best in the beginning if your opponent only advances one square.  The French Defense is an example (1.e4 d6 2.d4.)  And black was correct about the logic behind this.  He guessed that it opened up other lines and variations for an attack.  BTW at this point he thinks that I am a very good coach and he is beginning to understand the positions extremely well.  That is one of my goals.  I want to get him familiar so that he can study analyze and think about the positions.  This is something it takes to be a strong chess player.

Best however was 5...Nc6 as it is still a developing move (a move that also continues with development.  I explained that concept to him and the fact that a Knight on a rim is grim.  Why?

After this move my opponent said ""Protected I think I meant the king your king is now protected in the corner Damn I totally missed that I was jeopardizing my knight for your pawn...an error for sure.""  Then I told him that the King was protected and that is why one should castle early and often.  I also told him the definition of general principles.  That General Opening Priniciples=guidelines to help you in the opening.  I told him that one of those guidelines was not moving the same piece twice.  Afterall I am little more developed so I am also a little more prepared and ready as we will see later on.  He said ""Great Advice"".

In other words this is best as 8...Ne7 blocks his Queen and DSB for later on and 8...Nf6 looses another Knight for a different pawn.  If he leaves it there however where is the development?  In other words the Knight has to come out somehow and someway.
663,19,14,Bf4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p1p3n/p3P3/2B1NB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Now I am thinking about another move like Ng5 with one of my Knights but I would like to prevent my Knight from traveling twice at this point in time to set a good example for my opponent.  I also think about playing Qd5 but don't as that would put my Queen in danger and because of what I mentioned in my last sentence.  Therefore I bring out my other bishop.  As I told the opponent this is part of getting all your pieces out.  This move however completely controls the center.  I also mentioned why we want to develop in chess.  One of the goals is to control the center.
664,19,15,Ng4,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p1p4/p3P3/2B1NBn1/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',? I am not sure why he moved there.  However he is still moving the same piece more then once and I told him that this is another mistake.  Why?
665,19,16,1Nfg5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p1p4/p3P1N1/2B1NBn1/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',!! Because of this.  BTW this is where I told him that it is ok to move the same piece more then once after the center is controlled.  Now if he takes my Knight 11.Bxg5 so pieces are exchanged.  When you are behind you generally don't want to exchange.  However accepting an exchange is best in this position as we will see momentarily.  Therefore this is a move that deserves two exclamation points as it is extraordinarily brilliant and very well spotted because of what I have in store for him.  
666,19,17,1Be7,b'r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/1p1p4/p3P1N1/2B1NBn1/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I understand this move very well.  He wants to castle and is a little worried that I might try to mate him.  However that is not my intention in this position.  With this move I told him that although exchanging is not usually a good idea when you are down material this is an exception.  I also could respond with 11.Nxe7 winning his h8 rook and f7 pawn.  However 11.Bxf7+ is even better.  Why?  Taking with my Knight would still give him a chance to castle Queenside if he completes development.  Although I won't get nearly as much by taking with the bishop this move loses a pawn and his opportunity to castle.  That is why 10.Nfg5!! was extraordinarily brilliant.  Because of this his center is virtually destroyed but I am almost completely developed.  
667,19,18,1Bd5,b'r1bq1k1r/2p1b1pp/1p1p4/p2BP1N1/4NBn1/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',So I pull the bishop back.  Normally I don't want my pieces to get attacked as it wastes tempo.  However this is an exception because of what I just outlined earlier.  Now I have a winning edge even though the game is not lost for black.  Why?  Being a piece ahead is often the difference between a win and loss.
668,19,19,1Ba6,b'r2q1k1r/2p1b1pp/bp1p4/p2BP1N1/4NBn1/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',"?? I'm not sure why he moved here but this is his loosing blunder.  BTW I told him that 12.Bb7 was better.  @flutie39: I apologize for that.  Why?  That would not have been any better.  As it turns out 12...Qe8 was best and still keeps you in the game.  It would have been the only way the protect the Queen and still loses a Rook.  As it turns out however this move loses his Queen and a8 Rook for my g5 Knight after 13.Ne6+.  That is because Ne6 forks the King and Queen so black is forced to get himself out of check.  And he cannot do this with his Queen.  Then he asked ""And I should have been looking for vulnerability of my Queen...""  @flutie39: Yes.  It is always important to be aware of the dangers that lie ahead.
"
669,19,20,Kd7,b'B6r/2pkb1pp/bp1p4/p3P3/4NBn1/8/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? In this position he is trying to win my LSB.  However as mentioned earlier it is always important to see the threat.  @flutie39: This is a perfect example.  Having said that this move is another big mistake as it loses another piece and pawn after placing him in check.
670,19,21,Rf8,b'B3kr2/2p1b1Qp/bp1p4/p3P3/4NB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now he is forced to protect his Rook.
671,19,22,1Bc6+,b'4kr2/2p1b1Qp/bpBp4/p3P3/4NB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now I am setting up a good attack against him given that I am completely developed.  This is the cornerstone of the attack.
672,19,23,1Bg5,b'3k1r2/2p1b1Qp/bpBp4/p3P1B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So I do not waste time to pin his DSB.  In fact this move wins his bishop.  I took that into account before making this move.
673,19,24,Rg8,b'2k3r1/2p1Q2p/bpBp4/p3P1B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"?? I'm not sure why he moved there but I accurately told him that 20...Rh8 was best.  Then he asked ""Why would Rh8 be better?""  As a result I pointed out that anything else just loses the Rook.  Therefore this move should have won his other rook.  However I missed that opportunity with my next move.  Note: Even coaches and/or mentors miss opportunities.  This happened in one of my games against Jack Stockel.  After I missed a threat he said that he could have taken a piece but overlooked that opportunity.  In addition if my opponents rook leaves the eighth rank it's mate in one.  "
674,19,25,2e6,b'2k3r1/2p1Q2p/bpBpP3/p5B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This is how I overlook my chance.  Instead 21.Qe6+ should have been played.  That move would have forked his King and remaining Rook.  Then this would have happened 21...Kb8 (forced) 22.Qxg8+ so that he has to respond with Bc8 in order to avoid mate.  
675,19,26,2d5,b'2k3r1/2p1Q2p/bpB1P3/p2p2B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So he decides to attack my Knight.
676,19,27,2Nf6,b'2k3r1/2p1Q2p/bpB1PN2/p2p2B1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And I respond by attacking his Rook.
677,19,28,2Rxg5,b'2k5/2p1Q2p/bpB1PN2/p2p2r1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"?? I understand why he made this move.  It wins a free piece but as the master mater and Master elyhim would say ""To take is a mistake"".  Having said that this was a move that I did not expect.  Unlike most games in a coaching game I always hope that my opponent will make the best move not the worst.  Having said that I told my opponent that 22...Rh8 was best as it still protects his Rook and prevents what I am going to do next.  What is my intention?  This time unlike move 21 I am not going to miss my opportunity as I now have a mate in one after 23.Qe8#.  "
678,19,29,2Qe8#,b'2k1Q3/2p4p/bpB1PN2/p2p2r1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"BTW I heard about flutie39 before this game from jstevens1.  As it turns out he is also in the ""Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run"" club.  Overall he played extremely well but made two serious mistakes that ended this game.  In fact I believe that he played far north of his rating.  If I had to evaluate I would say that he played more like a 950 rated player then 825.  In general however you want to develop and get your pieces out ASAP. The other thing is that you always want to be careful of your opponents intention.  Afterall his or her plans are just as important as your own.  @flutie39: I believe that you are on a northward trend.  Therefore if you can remember this game and the moral it is extremely likely that your rating will reach 1000 within a year.  Note: I always have optimisim and ""The glass is half full not half empty"" as they say."
679,20,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So here I was up against the highest rated player in the tournament
680,20,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I reply with my usual
681,20,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He follows the main line

683,20,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',He continues with the Open Sicilian
684,20,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So I take
685,20,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He takes back
686,20,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I hit the e pawn
687,20,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',He defends
688,20,9,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I stop ideas such as Nd4xNc6 followed by e5. All this is very standard
689,20,10,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',And this is the most popular too the Richter–Rauzer Attack. The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable as g6 is simply met by BxNf6 and after exf6 Black's pawns are a mess the d6 pawn in particular being isolated and backward on a semi-open file and the d5 square is open for White's pieces.
690,20,11,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I follow a suggestion by Barden
691,20,12,f4,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',He continues to develop

693,20,14,Qd2,b'r2qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p1np1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',He prepares to castle

Qd2xc3 and after gxBf6 play 12. Nd4xNc6 winning a pawn. However Black can reply with Qc7 and after White retreats his knight exchange queens on c3 and the position is about level. Black has compensation for being a pawn down as White's queen side pawns are smashed. This was better for White compared to what happened where White ends up a pawn down AND a broken pawn formation.

Of course this allows Nf6 to go to d5 my bishop retires to g3... and Na5 can easily trap my queen! So I had to consider more moves: 
13. Qc2 (why not? After it Bd3 shielded my queen). 
13. Bd3 at once. It is not a problem because the Nd2 will exchange anything that takes e4 and the bishop will be defended by the rook. 
13. Bb5 and if ever a6 BxN. Finally 13. e5 and if Ne4 Rh2 or something (f2 is threatened). 
AH! and don't forget that if ever my pawn h goes to 4 I can think seriously about a sac (Nxe6) taking advantage of the queen lined with the king (Ba3). My queen can help to it in some lines. 
Finally Rg1 has some good point: after central exchanges if the f7 pawn retakes something on e6 the g6 bishop is threatened. I know this is not the priority in this position but still when analyzing you have to look for everything.

As black this is my favorite e4-e5 opening not because I am particularly successful with it but because it always full of tactical and sharp play.

But in this particular position there are better moves: 4.Ng5 (which always tempts me to play the Traxler experiment 4...Lc5?!) 4.d4 or less sharp 4.d3.
951,30,3,Nxe4,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This is the reason why 4.Nc3 isn't really good: black gains the initiative.

This leaves the black king in the center and puts it on a semi-open e-file. However many times in the past I've lost games that started similarly due to the sudden kingside attacks so this time my personal experience trumped the common sense. Besides I've thought that this move would mean easier future development for the rook. As it turned out that rook served only one purpose till the end - to be captured by the white knight. :)

Fritz suggests 8.d4 h6 9.Nh3 Bxh3 10.gxh3 and evaluates this position as slightly better for the black.

The next idea was 16...a6 to take away b5 field as a possibility for the white queen. I was willing to allow Qxb7 and even to sacrifice the rook to start the attack by Nd4. I believed I would have an edge in this variation (again the computer says I was wrong).

What I didn't see here is the danger black faces on the e-file if the white knight is removed from e2. Until now this knight was pinned and during the time the other knight was on h3 and king on e1 I was completely unaware of the white's possibility to castle. In that case e2 knight would remain unprotected and I'd simply capture it with my queen - that was my calculation and it ended there completely ignoring the following move by white - a skewer on e-file!

Perhaps white oversaw that as well as he didn't castle in the previous moves."

EVALUATE:
Material - even
King safety - in this endgame king safety is not a critial factor
Special features - White has a powerful passed pawn on the 5th rank Black has a Queenside pawn majority.
Activity - White king is well centralised. Blacks king is placed to help attack the queenside pawns. Whites rook is well placed on the second rank where it can go behind the passed pawn. Blacks rook will likely go passive to prevent the advanced passed pawn advancing.
Conclusion: White has the advantage."

1272,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi Everyone! This is sanjay2000 and I'm going to be showing a game in that Walking the Walk and learning to run MT Part 4. myevilluck was my opponent and I learned a lot of things even though I played a losing blunder.
1273,38,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Modern(Robotsch) Defence
1274,38,2,Bxd4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3bP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',I guess this is pawn pinching but it was free.
1275,38,3,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Developing and exerting more control over e5. White is leading in development here and I am feeling the heat
1276,38,4,Qb3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/2n3p1/3p4/4P3/1QPB1N2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Excellent move. Attacks d5 and b7
1277,38,5,1f4,b'r2qk1nr/pQp1pp1p/4b1p1/3pb3/4PP2/2PB4/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b kq f3',Tempo loss for me
1278,38,6,1Bb5+,b'r2qk1nr/pQp1ppbp/4b1p1/1B1p4/4PP2/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',And myevilluck unleashes the powerful 11.Bb5+!!! This is where I start losing the plot.
1279,38,7,1f5,b'r2q1knr/pQp1ppbp/4b1p1/1B1p1P2/4P3/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Bb5+ followed by 12.f5!! Winning the Bishop. I felt defeated already.
1280,38,8,Rb8,b'1r1q1knr/pQpBppbp/6p1/3p1P2/4P3/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Thr
1281,38,9,1fxg6,b'1r1q1knr/pQpBppbp/6P1/3p4/4P3/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b - -',Threatening Mate which I didn't see.
1282,38,10,1Rxb7,b'3q1knr/prpBppbp/6P1/3p4/4P3/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w - -',I greedily grabbed the queen thinking it was free. Until he played.....
1283,38,11,1Rxf7#,b'3q1knr/prpBpRbp/6P1/3p4/4P3/2P5/PP4PP/RNB3K1 b - -',Rxf7# This just goes to show that material does not matter. Feel free to comment!
1284,39,0,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I've gone through a long period of trying out the Scandinavian (1...d5) but against a much stronger opponent I decided to go with the more solid Caro-Kann which has similar themes.
1285,39,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',When I play the CKD this is usually the variation I play although on account of this game and others 4...Nd7 is looking more enticing.
1286,39,2,exf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',5...gxf6 is also playable but I prefer the more structurally sound version which also allows for quick natural development.
1287,39,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',This move deviated from my other experience with this variation against a 2000 opponent which I lost after an unexpected tactical shot on the 28th move: 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. Re1 Nd7 11. Be2 Nb6 12. c3 Nd5 13. Qc2 Bg6 14. Bd3 Bxd3 15. Qxd3 Qd7 16. c4 Ne7 17. b3 Ng6 18. Be3 Bf4 19. Rad1 Qc7 20. Bxf4 Nxf4 21. Qe4 Ng6 22. d5 cxd5 23. cxd5 Qd6 24. Nd4 Ne5 25. Nf5 Qb6 26. Ne7+ Kh8 27. Rd4 Rad8 28. Qxh7+   1-0
1288,39,4,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',The best square for the bishop and preparing to castle but White has a different idea.
1289,39,5,Qe7,b'rnb1k2r/pp2qppp/2pb1p2/8/2BP4/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq -',Despite my doubled pawns there's still enough material on the board to exchange queens but not enough that my king is unsafe in the center of the board.
1290,39,6,Kxe7,b'rnb4r/pp2kppp/2pb1p2/8/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ -',Plus if needed the king can go to f8 and g8 after the Rh8 moves and White is not in a state of development to take advantage of the king's current position.
1291,39,7,1Bd3,b'rn5r/pp2kppp/2pbbp2/8/3P4/3B4/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Naturally White does not want to un-double the black pawns after 10. Bxe6 fxe6
1292,39,8,g5,b'r6r/pp1nkp1p/2pbbp2/6p1/3P4/3B4/PPP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - g6',I wanted to deny White the f4 square but this is the my first of two errors. And yet I expected White's reply. 11... Rhe8 is natural and better (if 12. Bxh7 g6)
1293,39,9,1f4,b'r6r/pp1nkp1p/2pbbp2/6p1/3P1P2/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1B2RK1 b - f3',Unfortunately it was only now that I realized I couldn't play 12... h6 on account of 13. f5 Bd5 14. c4
1294,39,10,1gxf4,b'r6r/pp1nkp1p/2pbbp2/8/3P1p2/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',So now my king is less safe and my pawn structure is even more dilapidated.
1295,39,11,Rag8,b'6rr/pp1nkp1p/2pbbp2/8/3P1B2/3B4/PPP1N1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Looking for counter-play down the g-file.
1296,39,12,Bh3,b'6rr/pp1nkp1p/2pb1p2/8/2PP1B2/3B3b/PP2N1PP/R4RK1 w - -',I don't know why I hoped to catch my opponent napping with this.
1297,39,13,1Nf4,b'6rr/pp1n1p1p/2pk1p2/8/2PP1N2/3B3b/PP4PP/R4RK1 b - -',Obvious even to me as I saw it coming after 14... Bh3
1298,39,14,1Be6,b'6rr/pp1n1p1p/2pkbp2/8/2PP1N2/3B4/PP4PP/R4RK1 w - -',I considered a retreat to g4 perhaps hoping to entice a structural weakening for White with 17. h3 but decided to head to the more central e6 immediately.
1299,39,15,Rg7,b'7r/pp1n1prp/2pkbp2/8/2PP1N2/3B4/PP4PP/4RRK1 w - -',Looking to double up the rooks. This move isn't bad per se but it does lead indirectly to my demise.
1300,39,16,Kc7,b'7r/ppkn1prp/2p1bp2/2P5/3P1N2/3B4/PP4PP/4RRK1 w - -',Hoping to dash the king away on the queen side but this is the losing blunder. And while 18... Ke7 is necessary walking into the bishop pin looked ugly. Now I expected 19. Nxe6 fxe6 20. Rxe6 but was in for a rude shock. 
1301,39,17,1Rxe6,b'7r/ppkn1prp/2p1Rp2/2P5/3P1N2/3B4/PP4PP/5RK1 b - -',Obviously now if 19... fxe6 20. Nxe6+ is a killer. So I resigned.
