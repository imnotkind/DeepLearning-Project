3,0,3,1Qd4,b'r1b1kb1r/3p1ppp/p1p1p3/q7/2PQn3/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Simple coup pour faire bouger le cavalier noir.  Ce dernier m'empęche de sortir mon cavalier en c3 ou d2.

16,1,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',1. Nf3 (the Reti Opening) - my last opponent apastpawn (Wayne) played this against me and won so I thought I would spring this suprise on another Expert!  Marin however responds with c5 instead of d5

(the error that costs the game - I think that I forgot that my knight was defending d2 so I took with the b pawn - if I had taken a deep breath and counted to ten before taking with the pawn I would have taken in the bigger picture and got rid of the backward pawn in one fell swoop)  Now on move 39 I pay pay pay!

I decide to take some satisfaction of winning back a pawn  before tossing in the sponge next move on the grounds of impending ruinous loss of material).  Well folks this is my longest game against an Expert so far.  It just goes to show - one mistake against these Experts and it is CERTAIN that you will pay through the nose and end up with the BLOB!!
35,1,19,5b2,b'3r2k1/5pp1/4p2p/8/R4P2/3P2PP/bp5K/5B2 w - -',
36,2,0,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',King's Gambit Declined. I usually prefer 4.Nc3 to 4.c3. 
37,2,1,d3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I was in a mood for experiments. Usually I would get my bishop to c4 or b5 but this time decided to do something different. 
38,2,2,Na4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/N3PP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard manouver in this type of positions to exchange the annoying bishop. 
39,2,3,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1pnp1n2/4p3/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Already here I thought that leaving the bishop behind the pawn chain was not a good idea. Black has at least equality natural positions for the pieces. The rook goes to e8 bishop to g4 d7 or e6 the other rook can join the game through a5... 
40,2,4,exf4,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1pnp1n2/8/4Pp2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Thank you. At least I can get the bishop out without losing a tempo. 
41,2,5,d5,b'r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1pn2n2/3p4/4PB2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Wow. I never expected this. Which made me feel bad for a moment since unexpected moves are a sign of a bad form or poor thinking process. But then I thought wait a moment it shouldn't be so good. He just gave extra space to my bishop on f4 allowed e4-e5 with subsequent d3-d4. Doesn't smell right. Ah e5 will be met by Nh5 but I'll play Bg5 so I am Ok. If f6 I'll just exchange the pawns.  
42,2,6,1d4,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppn1ppp/1pn5/3pP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Naturally. I already started thinking about putting the bishop to d3 looking at the h7 pawn. 
43,2,7,1f6,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppn2pp/1pn2p2/3pP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Damn. I did not even think what I was going to do if he played f6 now. Now I can capture the knight will go back to f6 and black's position is Ok. The pawn looks bad on f6 I should be able to exploit it somehow. What if e5-e6? Strange but here for some reason I thought that black knight is trapped. I did not even see it could go to b8!!!
44,2,8,Ndb8,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn1Pp2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',"One pawn down. Need to think about damage control now. What is my advantage? Developed pieces. Let's continue developing the pieces. As Bronstein used to say: ""I'll give him a pawn he will use a tempo to take it I will make a useful move..."". "
45,2,9,1a3,b'rn1q1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn1bp2/3p4/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Useful move. Limits the knight on c6 but also the pawn on a2 may need protection. Strange thought? Not at all. Think of c2-c4 thrust and if black captures I play d4-d5. But I need a rook on d1 for that. Take the rook from a1 and the a2 pawn will be defenceless. But also I don't know at this stage where would be the best position for the rook - d1 or e1. So it is also a waiting move. Let's see what black has in mind. 
46,2,10,1Ne7,b'rn1q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1p2bp2/3p4/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Interesting plan. Rather strange. The second knight is coming to c6 I guess. Two black pieces on e file. Time to move the rook. 
47,2,11,Bf5,b'rn1q1rk1/1pp3pp/1p3pn1/3p1b2/3P4/P4NB1/1PPQB1PP/4RRK1 w - -',Oooh. This just invites my next move. 
48,2,12,2Nh4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1pn2p2/3p1b1P/3P3N/P5B1/1PPQB1P1/4RRK1 b - -',White seems to have a serious pressure on the kingside. Wanna test it? Flip the board look at the position with black's eyes. It feels uncomfortable. But black plays a good move!
49,2,13,2Be4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1pn2p2/3p3P/3Pb2N/P5B1/1PPQB1P1/4RRK1 w - -',Suddenly I felt not so optimistic. f6-f5 is coming. I need to think defence. Primary goal? Exchanging black's most active piece - Bishop e4! 
50,2,14,2Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1pn2p2/3p3P/3Pb2N/P2B2B1/1PPQ2P1/4RRK1 b - -',!? Complications! Now N:d4 22.B:e4 de 23.R:e4 loses the queen after 23...N:f3 . I don't have time for c2-c3. 
51,2,15,2Nxd4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1p3p2/3p3P/3nb2N/P2B2B1/1PPQ2P1/4RRK1 w - -',As expected. 
52,2,16,2Qf4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/1p3p2/7P/3npQ1N/P5B1/1PP3P1/4RRK1 b - -',! Yes. Not only delaying the capture on e4 but also giving up the pawn on c2. Good move White's concentration of pieces on the kingside starts to look intimidating. 
53,2,17,2Nec6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn2p2/7P/3npQ1N/P5B1/1PP3P1/4RRK1 w - -',I would have preferred f6-f5. Now that another piece moved away from the kingside my chances seem pretty good. 
54,2,18,2Nf5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn2p2/5N1P/4RQ2/P5B1/1Pn3P1/5RK1 b - -',"Closing in on the black king. I looked into different options with h5-h6 and capture on c7 looked at the possibility of throwing the rook on the 7th line (no idea how to get it done at this stage...) and decided to bring the knight closer to action. Tal liked to play moves like this - he called it ""throw in"". The knight becomes potentially very dangerous. You never know what it can do - sacrifice on g7 or h6 go to e7 to enable the rook finally get to the seventh line or cover the d4 square. Very useful move. "
55,2,19,2Ra5,b'3q1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn2p2/r4N1P/4RQ2/P5B1/1Pn3P1/5RK1 w - -',Well played. Black brings the sleeping rook into the game. Little bit late I must say. 
56,2,20,2Qg4,b'3q1rk1/1pp3pp/1pn2p2/r4N1P/4R1Q1/P5B1/1Pn3P1/5RK1 b - -',Simple but efficient. Now g7 can't be protected by the rook because Nh6  wins exchange. The black queen also can't step on d7 because of the same Nh6. So...
57,2,21,Qd3,b'5rk1/1pp3pp/1pn2p2/5Q1P/4R3/P2q2B1/1Pn3P1/5RK1 w - -',An attempt to coordinate pieces that are all over the board. Black also attacks the bishop on g3. 
58,2,22,2Qe6+,b'5rk1/1pp3pp/1pn1Qp2/7P/4R3/P2q2B1/1Pn3P1/5RK1 b - -',First let's get out of the pin. 
59,2,23,2Bxc7,b'5r1k/1pB3pp/1pn1Qp2/7P/4R3/P2q4/1Pn3P1/5RK1 b - -',"A move for a reason. Now here a move like Ncd4 would be punished by 30.Qf7! threatening a back rank mate. Even if black plays something else that leave the d-file open the queen can't come for help since the d8 square is under control by the ""escapee"" bishop. But black preferred to lose differently. "

Bb4  after a few pawn moves I make the following decision based on the fact that I would like to castle kingside.  However I did not want my knight on f6 to be harassed by the usual bishop pin so I decided to develop my bishop with check on b4.  I know it may help black develop (Wayne queried this move on this basis) but at least it eliminates his dark square bishop and this kind of annoying pin.  After the bishops are exchanged I castle immediately so I at least keep apace in the development stakes - not bad for black I thought.

If R to d6 guarding the c6 N (thinking white can exchange once then the seond capture would be with the white queen and costly): then Ng5 again.

Back to the issue of king safety regarding castling.  I think it is a case of knowing when and when not to move that h pawn.  In this case I feel the h pawn should have been moved.  This would have made the king much safer.  Just look at that final position and look at how horribly exposed the black king is now!!  So I feel I have been well and truly given an Expert Lesson in King Safety."

I at first thought about going to Ne4 but I felt like yes that would get it more towards the center of the board but I feel like that move would just shove the knight out there in the open. Like you said a bit too risky for me. I also at first thought that Nfd7 would clog up the development perhaps suffocating the Queen side bishop but that can be remedied in the next few moves and it is ""safer"" than Ne4. If I were you I would have my eye on 5. Nxd5 hoping then for 5...exd5 and then 6. e6 to fork my knight and pawn and then after I move my knight you could go for what looks to be a solid pawn move with 7. exf7  not only breaking the h7-f7 pawn wall but also putting me in check making me move 7...Kxf7 preventing me from castling and bringing my king forward and thus away from safety. Wow...I better watch it! :)

 (adui) A well thought out plan for me. You are playing my side as well as I if differently. I chose this to remedy the one flaw in your synopsis. Had I followed your route to its conclusion that would leave my pawn unguarded at e6. While you would still be forced to brake your king side castle defense up I would lose my pawn at that point.
The Nh3 move allows for a later Ng5 covering that possibility. It also opens up the possibility of taking a different approach with a 7Bg5 checking your Queen.
Were I you I would either play Be7 both blocking the potential Queen attack and opening up King side for Castle or Play Nc6 to develop my other knight. I would probably do both 5Be7 then 6 Nc6. Follow ups from there are entirely dependent on how the board develops."

 (adui) Hmm At this juncture I would likely not have done either move. Bg4 is moot for the reasons you state and while its just my personal feeling I will trade a knight for a bishop but not vice versa as I seethe bishop as the more threatening piece.
I think were I you I would have advanced the b or c pawn to row 6 to allow development of your queen and or bishop. This knight move while giving you the knights power out front completely blocks the rest of your power on the back row."

169,9,1,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',4. ......... Nxe4 (moves 3 and 4 are very standard classical Petrov).
170,9,2,d3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',5. d3 chases the knight away and opens a diagonal to the queen bishop.
171,9,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',5. Black backs his knight off to f6 and the position looks very symmetrical.  I bring my other knight out next move and this hits at e4 and d5.
172,9,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',6. ............... d5 (centralises a pawn so I do likewise next move and clear a diagonal for the king bishop).  On moves 7 and 9 we continue the symmetry

I wondered about the feasibility of breaking the pin with g4 as it does weaken the kingside castling position - I decided to click on the database button just to see if there was a position recorded - luckily there was and the percentage was favourable to white - the next few moves were made in conjunction with the database which ended with the exchange of bishops on d3.  They were all good solid moves involving harassing the light squared bishop - so much so that in order to avoid a possible pawn bust up on the kingside or if black is not careful his bishop could be trapped the bishop exchanges itself and the white queen looks safe on d3 - I did look at the possibility of Ktg5 later on ganging up on the white h pawn but this did not materialise).  I therefore decided to accept the recommendation of the 1900s database.

Nfd7 dislodges my knight back to f3 (I did consider exchanging knights but then thought that it would only help him develop the other knight and there was also the possibility of the black queen coming to h4 which could be dangerous especially with a dark squared bishop bearing down on h2)

Rob and I agreed in the chat that I should have exchanged knights here but I go and play c3?? (  whatever more question marks should be added) to back up my d4 pawn.  This takes away the defence of the d3 square allowing his knight to go to d3 and discover an attack on my hanging f3 knight and threatens the rook on e1 - I give up the exchange and play on for just a few more moves but I resigned when I knew that I was going to be at least 3 material points behind with no counterplay) - it is such a shame that the game had to end in this way and I hope I can give Rob a better show later on.
183,9,15,Re3,b'r5k1/pp3ppp/1np5/3p4/P2P1PP1/1PP1r1NP/q6N/1R3QK1 w - -',
184,10,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',1. ....... c5 (this is the Sicilian Defence - this pawn move is to prevent 2. d4 so I prepare it with 2. Nf3)

188,10,4,Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/pq2p3/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',6.  I get on with my development with 6. Nc3 - this move backs up the e pawn.
189,10,5,Be3,b'r1b1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/pqn1p3/8/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',7. Be3 develops a piece and attacks the Wicked Witch of the West (my opponent's queen) and Marin hides her on c7.
190,10,6,f4,b'r1b1kbnr/1pqp1ppp/p1n1p3/8/4PP2/1NN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq f3',8. I consolidate the centre with f4

198,10,14,1b4,b'2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/1p2PP2/PNNQBB2/1PP3PP/3R1RK1 w - -',15. ......... b4 (a pawn push forces an exchange of pawns which results in me having to move my queen to d2 on move 17).  Marin then pushes his pawn to d5.  Because my e pawn is under so much pressure I decide to exchange it.  Marin asked me whether I had considered e5?  Oops - maybe I have made the wrong decision.  There then follows a plethora of exchanges and I come off worse.
199,10,15,a5,b'2r2rk1/2q1bppp/4p3/p7/5P2/1N2Q3/1PP3PP/2R2RK1 w - -',22. ........ a5 - a pawn push threatening a removal of the guard by playing a4 so I move my queen off the pin line.  Maybe this was another mistake judging by what followed next and I would have done much better to get my KING off the pin line instead!
200,10,16,Bf6,b'2r2rk1/2q2ppp/4pb2/8/p4P2/8/1PP1Q1PP/N1R2RK1 w - -',24. ........... Bf6 (attacking the b pawn so I defend it by playing c4?? but this move loses because of the queen fork on b6 - maybe I should have played b3 instead).  Hindsight is always 20/20 vision (I think you have heard this before and may hear this many more times from me when playing 2000  players!!) so I now lose a pawn.
201,10,17,2Qd1,b'2r2rk1/5ppp/4pb2/8/p1P2P2/8/1q4PP/N1RQ1R1K b - -',27. I try and complicate things by attacking the a pawn by Qd1 but he simply pushes it on.  I spend the next few moves trying to win it but to no avail.
202,10,18,3Rd1,b'r5k1/5ppp/4p3/8/2Pb1P2/8/p5PP/N2R3K b - -',"33. Rd1 - I attack the bishop but I have just seen what is about to happen.  He will play B x N I will have to reply with R x B and he will then play 34....... Rb8 - this will lead to mate on the back rank (if 35. Rxa2) or ruinous loss of material - he will crown his pawn on if 35. g3 h3 or Kg1).  So I decided to resign the game.

So that is five games against five experts and 5 blobs to me.  At the moment except for my Expert game in Battle of the Wings I have looked way way out of my depth against the Experts so far - but I will not give up although I will continue to play unrated games below master level).  The only thing I can say is that this week I managed to draw against two 1600s players (my record against the complete 1600s games is played 3 drawn 2 lost 1) so maybe I am on the upward curve - only time will tell.

I can block that easily enough but the problem I have is I'm likely to leave two of your queen bishop knight combination attacking f7
318,18,3,Qxg5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np1q1/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I decided to abandon the knight on d5 I'm sure that there would be a better move if I looked hard possibly b-e6. As it is I think the move I made exposes two weaknesses in my play. Firstly I tend to be too materially biased liking to keep even or better material than my opponent. Secondly I have a bad habit of playing pieces individually rather than launching co-ordinated attacks.
319,18,4,Bxd5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3Bp1q1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Now I realise how much trouble I've put myself in. Either I sacrifice the f pawn and allow you to threaten the king directly or I sacrifice the b pawn to your bishop. If I do the former then the permutations are too complicated for me to calculate I think I can defend it but I'm not sure. If I do the latter and allow bxp then to protect the rook I have to countertake bxb at which time qxb and the rook is going to fall anyway....(play it out on a board if it helps)

I've decided to lose the f pawn and hope for the best rather than swallow a rook loss. Again after I made the move I considered the implications (always try to do that before it helps *lol*). If you take the knight and I counter take with the pawn then qxp and I'm forked on rook and king so it was a very poor response from me.

The obvious move is the counter take but I can see your thinking in attacking the e pawn and possibly clearing a path for your rooks. I think it could have waited a move though the tempo would still have been yours.

Now I have a chance to extract the bishop and I'm ahead materially. Not just that but it sends my confidence back to a high level.

I would have gone back to f2 myself. Going to f3 means I can split your pawns. Rem I didn't want my pawns doubled earlier? Thats cos pawns only retain their power if they are together.

I know him as a strong positional player but also pretty good tactically - certainly a respectable opponent.

A very good practical move baiting White to try something active while keeping all options open (the Knight can go from d7 to either c5 or e5).

Not necessarily the best move (solid options are 33...Ng4 33...Qg4 and 33...b5) but seems principled - Black wants to exchange heavy pieces and win the h6 pawn.

White's  strong pair of Bishops needs to be supported by the Queen to be fully effective. On the other hand if White wants to allow the exchange then this is certainly the best way to do it - gaining tempi to improve the King.

448,23,53,Nxh6,b'5k2/1p5p/p2p2pn/3P4/P1P1B3/4K3/1P6/8 w - -',"? Definitely a big mistake. Since black-squared Bishop is gone now I should have played 41...a5! followed with 42...b6 to create a blockade on black squares and only then pick up the h6 pawn.

That said 44.Kf4 is a bit more precise here since: A) 44...a5? doesn't work due to 45.c6 Kc7; 46.ba5 and B) 44...Nf5?; 45.Bf5 gf5; 46.a5!

The reason is that I sensed (did not calculate) that losing time on the a6 pawn would allow White to endanger the kingside passers and draw the game. One possible variation (found in analysis) is 50...Kb6; 51.Be2 Nb4; 52.Ke4 Na6; 53.Kd5 and Black pieces are cut off on the edge of the board and therefore can't help the pawns. This move does not win yet but now White has to play precisely to hold the position.

The are several interesting elements to notice: 1. the Bishop can't immediately assist the King in winning the kingside pawns because it does not control the crucial g file 2. kingside passers can't move because the Bishop has them both pinned at the moment 3. if the Bishop remains on b1 then all Black can do is try to advance the d pawn a bit further 4. (not obvious at the first glance) if the Bishop attacks the d5 with 55.Ba2! the kingside passers can move - but to their detriment!

This was a tense and hard-fought game between evenly matched opponents which was ultimately decided not by superior skill but by time trouble and nerves. Nevertheless it does carry certain learning points: 1. In important team matches a draw is often a good result (especially for Black) while a loss can be catastrophic - this can greatly influence the amount of risk that players are willing to take 2. Opening preparation is important but it can be dodged by the opponent so solid backup plan is needed 3. I always strived to have a solid position which was easier to play and allowed me to be calm for the most part of the game (which was a big factor in the endgame) 4. Bishops have huge advantage over Knights in endgames where there are pawns (especially passers) on both wings 5. Activity of Kings is the key to the endgame --- Thank you for looking over this game I can answer any questions on private. Regards Marin Vukusic

If you're having trouble against the sicilian then I recommend this opening as the easiest way of dealing with sicilian. If you like to attack and tactically overwhelm your opponent then play open sicilian. I used to play it and still occasionally do.

He may of just wanted to get me out of my repoirtoire but in any case this move is bad and I will take advantage of the terribly placed knight. There was no need to lose a tempo and put it there. Nb6 or e6 would have been better.

Better was probably cxd4 cxd4 d6. exd6 gave a nice advantage to white also but Bd3 is more precise and actually exploits my advantage faster.

In general all of my pieces will become better than his. His Knight on c7 and Bishop on c8 and Q on d8 will take many moves to develop effectively if at all. His best piece is his knight on c6 which has a little pressure on d4 and e5.

The purpose of this is mainly to harrass the enemy and to force them into making a move that they might perhaps rather not do just yet which typically is moving the a7 pawn up to attack the bishop. This move has also developed the bishop and has now cleared the way for a castle should it be desired. On another level the enemy king is now starting to come under indirect threat. Moves like this can panic your opponent into making mistakes simply because you are making decisive moves that are doing something positive. You are taking control of the situation and forcing your opponent to react to your mvoes as opposed to the other way around.

Had I moved it to a4 then I ran the risk of b7 - b5 which would attack the bishop again and force it back down to b3. That becomes a little tight in that corner so by moving it to c4 I can use the space I have available to me to maneuver. I can be attacked by a pawn to d5 but at least in this case I have a greater scope of escape for the bishop.

Not only that but the pawn on f7 is being attacked by the bishop as well. This focuses on having more attacking than defending. Were the pawn to be taken there is nothing to stop the attacking piece just yet. If the bishop took the pawn that would be check with no real option to do anything other than move the king out of check which in turn would block something else off. If the knight were to make the attack then that would allow a later move to either take the queen or the rook. When it comes to a situation of which to take it is best to remember which is tactically better to be taken with as little loss as possible. For Example if it came to the bit yes the queen could be taken at the loss of the knight. However the rook could be taken for essentially free. We shall have to see what my opponent does in response to this before we can speculate any further.

Now I am forced to choose from several basically defensive moves to prevent the possible loss of my Queen and or Rook. As my opponent points out a knight attack on f7 would be disastrous for me as I cant even take the knight with my king so I would definitely lose at least one piece. This maneuver may still result in forfeiture of the castling ability but at the very least allows me to prevent the loss of my queen or rook to his attack. I considered advancing my Queens pawn but it would be moving into a three pronged attack with only two pieces backing it up.

In this case I believe I can get away with holding my ground with the other pieces and use this as a perfect opportunity to develop my queen as this was in my plan to begin with. In some cases it can be hard to tell who is playing to who's plan and it is vital to keep yours as fluid as possible. Otherwise you run the risk of getting tied in to something that is no longer appropriate.
(Adui) Hmmm under the circumstances I believe I may have gone on the attack here with an Bxe6 attack. My obvious answer is Pxe6 which would be followed by his Nxe6 giving him a two for one trade and a tactical edge with my queen threatened and the possibility my move dependent of Nxc7  with my rook threatened."

There are other moves that I could have made but they would have given away the initiative to my opponent. As I said earlier in the game it is better to have your opponent reacting to your moves rather than you reacting to his. This move by the knight is a highly risky one and could feasibly turn the centre of the board into a blood-bath. The knight attacks the enemy queen necessitating either the queen moving or the threat destroyed. There are 2 options available in taking the knight. There is the knight on f6 and the bishop on e6. The knight on d5 is protected by the pawn on e4 and the bishop on c4 so in the long run white would technically come out of the exchange with a better position.

It is becoming a very tight game with both players trying to make sure they aren't the first to lose pieces. What I have now created is a 2 vs 1 attack on the knight at f6. What happens now is up to my opponent. You can see how I try to use that simple rule as much as possible when I begin to plan an attack.

At this point I am happy to lose the knight as I know that I can bring in my queen to provide a very strong attacking force. I run the risk later of losing my rook as a result of his knight moving in to check me but I will have the option with my queen to take his rook and then rampage through his lines.

The general idea is to sacrifice the h-pawn to get a swift attack going on the king side. White is hoping for BxB pxB Qxp and then either Nh3 or Nf3 forcing the queen to retreat. White now have a half open h-file and can play either Bd3 or Qg4 as a continuation of the attack.

I was surprised to see White react to this phantom threat. In this opening White usually castles queen side as he has more or less committed to a king side attack.
