0,0,0,h6,b'3r1rk1/p2qbpp1/1p2pn1p/2p3B1/2N5/3PR3/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',this gains a bishop for the knight.
1,0,1,1Re4,b'3r1rk1/p2qbpp1/1p2p2p/2pn4/2N1R2B/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',I had expected 16 Rh3 Nf4 17 Rf3 Bxh4 18 Rxf4 Bg5 with an edge.  In this line it is a fair question whether black can get away with 16 ... g5 as there is a real possibility if the bishop doesn't get trapped the rook could get imprisoned by the pawns on the kingside.
2,0,2,1g5,b'3r1rk1/p2qbp2/1p2p2p/2pn2p1/2N1R2B/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - g6',this wins the bishop Noah's Ark style
3,0,3,1Re5,b'3r1rk1/p2qb3/1p2p2p/2pnRpp1/2N5/3P2B1/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - -',the most fighting chances.  black should certainly whether the attack after 18 Re1 f4 19 Qh5 Kg7.
4,0,4,Bf6,b'3r1rk1/p2q4/1p2pb1p/2pnR1p1/2N2p1B/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',this allows black to protect the pawn on e6.  also the bishop won't run away.
5,0,5,Bxe5,b'3r1rk1/p2q4/1p2p2p/2pnb1pQ/2N2p1B/3P4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',a close calculation revealed that white has nothing.
6,0,6,Qh7,b'3r1rk1/p6q/1p2p2p/2pnN1pQ/5p1B/3P4/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - -',wrong would be 21 ... Qg7?? 22 Ng4!
7,0,7,Ne3,b'3r1r2/p5qk/1pN1Q2p/2p5/5p1p/3PnP2/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',this move had been forseen.  it crushes white's resistance.
8,0,8,Kh8,b'3r1r1k/p5q1/1pN4p/2p5/4Qp1p/3PnP2/PPP3PP/R5K1 w - -',the finish might have been 27 g3 hxg3 28 h3 Rde8 29 Qa4 Qd7! with mate to soon follow or the taking of the knight if 30 Qa3.
9,1,0,axb6,b'rnbqk1nr/1pp2ppp/1p1p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The beginning of problems--poor compensation for a king bishop.

13,1,4,4Be7,b'2Rn3r/kp2B3/5p1p/3P1Pp1/4P3/6P1/7P/6K1 b - -',The position is resignable for black right here. The problem goes back to the central pawn formation he allowed at move 17...Nxd4.

28,3,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',So I am continuing with my adventures with the sicilian
29,3,1,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',All is standard so far what will white play here ?
30,3,2,a4,b'rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/P2NP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq a3',I'm surprised normally it's a bishop or the f pawn but I guess he wants to prevent b5
31,3,3,Nbd7,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/8/P2NP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I play as normal
32,3,4,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/8/P2NP3/2N5/1PP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Now the bishop

34,3,6,O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/P1n1p3/4P3/2N5/1PPNBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I suspect he will play b4 to chase the knight away which is kind of ok because I want to put my rooks on the c file

36,3,8,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/3nbppp/p2pbn2/Pp2p3/1P2P3/2N2B2/2PN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - -',I think I can cause white some problems along here
37,3,9,1Na2,b'5rk1/1q1nbppp/p2pbn2/Pp2p3/1Pr1P3/5B2/NBP2PPP/2RQRNK1 b - -',White is being slowly pinned back and now I can exert a little more pressure on this c file
38,3,10,2Nd5,b'2r3k1/1qrnbppp/p2pbn2/Pp1Np3/1P2P3/5B2/NBP2PPP/2RQR1K1 b - -',20 moves before first blood

40,3,12,Qa7,b'2r3k1/q4ppp/p2p1n2/Pp1Pp3/1P6/1N3B2/2r2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - -',Black turns attention to the f pawn
41,3,13,Qd4,b'6k1/5ppp/p2p1n2/Pp1P4/1P1qp3/8/1r3PPP/2NBQ1K1 w - -',Nice central square for the queen I think it is just a matter of time now white has no counter play 
42,3,14,Qd3,b'6k1/5ppp/p2p1n2/Pp1P4/1P2p3/3q4/1r2NPPP/3BQK2 w - -',White is running out of moves black is threatening Rb1 white's position is totally passive

45,4,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',my own defense that I've worked on for several years--designed to get the queens off and get into an endgame faster than usual. Most players are lost without the queen
46,4,1,Kxd6,b'rnb3nr/pp4pp/2pk1p2/8/2B1P3/8/PPPN2PP/R3K1NR w KQ -',I'm taking this idea a bit too far but I have an endgame already.
47,4,2,Rad8,b'3rr3/pb4pp/1k3n2/1pp1p3/4P2N/2PB3P/PP4P1/2KR1R2 w - -',All of a sudden my pieces are active. Black's minor pieces are doing nothing.
48,4,3,Bxe4,b'8/p6p/1k2Nr2/1pp1p3/4b3/2P4P/PP4P1/2KR4 w - -',It's happening like I planned--white has no advantage.
49,4,4,2Nxc5,b'8/p6p/1k3r2/1pNbp3/8/2P4P/PP4P1/2K1R3 b - -',loses on the spot--had to play Ng5
50,4,5,Rf2+,b'8/p6p/8/1pkbR3/8/2P4P/PP1K1rP1/8 w - -',and black resigned.
51,5,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Started with the king pawns taking the center. Pretty ordinary.
52,5,1,Qh5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',He brings the queen out attacking my pawn.  I've messed up many times in this situation before by trying to chase the queen away with g6.
53,5,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq -',So I decided to just protect my pawn and at the same time develop a piece.  
54,5,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',It always takes me a couple a minutes to respond to this attack. 
55,5,4,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',now I thrust out g6 and this is why I had new I had to bring out my knight in the previous turn.  Also later on if i want to i can fianchetto the bishop. 
56,5,5,Qf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',He is still going for the quick mate so I just block that square with...
57,5,6,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',Nf6. I think its a good developing move and next move I can develop my bishop.  In general I love it when the opponent brings his queen out too early because it is sometimes easier to develop your own pieces while attacking his queen.
58,5,7,c3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq -',I can see his idea is probably to take control of the center with d4 on his next move. 
59,5,8,Bh6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq -',so I figured that I could pin his pawn to his bishop and with this move he cannot properly develop his queen side pieces.   
60,5,9,Ne2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',he brings out his knight to e2 the only place it can really go while his queen is taking up the f3 square. Obviously he is planning to castle.
61,5,10,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',It took me a while to decide whether or not i was going to castle king side I did not like how the pawn structure was a little messed up for proper protection so decided that I should try to bring my bishop into the game and also start preparing for a queen side castle.
62,5,11,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Castles king side and in my opinion I think this was his only good move cause now his knight on e2 does not have to guard the bishop on c1 therefore his knight is free to attack the d4 square when he brings his pawn to d4. 
63,5,12,Be6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/2npbnpb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',It took me a while to determine where to put my bishop and in the end I figured that right now his only good piece that is on the board and I just thought it was a good trade. Plus after bxe6 then fxe6 I think that even though i have a temporary weakness having doubled up pawns. I planned attacking the center with my d pawn and if we trad pawns my center position would be strong and plus I figured by opening up the f-file my rook would have a nice place to go.
64,5,13,d4,b'r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnpb/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq d3',we trade bishops and then he attacks with his d pawn.
65,5,14,Bxc1,b'r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNb2RK1 w kq -',I could have brought my bishop to g7 but I did not want to let him take control of the h6-c1 diagonal and I did not want to lose tempo. so I took his bishop...
66,5,15,1Rxc1,b'r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 b kq -',...and he took back. At this point I think his position is a little better then mine because of his center pawns.
67,5,16,1Rf8,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 w q -',I put my rook onto the half-open file which I think is usually a good move at least now i have a possible discovered attack opportunity.
68,5,17,1Qe3,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P1Q3/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 b q -',Of course he will not give me the opportunity but at least I drove his queen away just a little bit.
69,5,18,1Ng4,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP1n1/2P1Q3/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 w q -',I attack his queen and the f2 pawn at least maybe I can win a pawn.
70,5,19,Nxf2,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP3/2P3Q1/PP2NnPP/RNR3K1 w q -',He attacked my knight on g4 then I took his pawn. 
71,5,20,1Nd2,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP3/2P3Q1/PP1NNnPP/R1R3K1 b q -',When I calculated my last move taking the pawn with my knight I was also attacking his e-pawn so i was worried when he brought his knight to d3 guarding it. I thought at this point that I might lose my knight especially if he brings his rook to f1.  
72,5,21,1d5,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2n1p1p1/3pp3/3PP3/2P3Q1/PP1NNnPP/R1R3K1 w q -',It took me along time to figure out what to do but I figured that my only hope was to get a pawn onto d5 so my f2 knight would have a place recede to. so I attacked with my d pawn.
73,5,22,exd5,b'r2qkr2/ppp4p/2n3p1/3pp3/3P4/2P3Q1/PP1NNnPP/R1R3K1 w q -',thankfully he took my pawn and I took back and now I have a little bit of relief for my knight.
74,5,23,Qe7,b'r3kr2/ppp1q2p/2n3p1/3pP3/8/2P3Q1/PP1NNnPP/R1R3K1 w q -',He gains his pawn back and I knew that I couldn't take his pawn so I brought out another attacker and was also trying to get my king to safety.
75,5,24,Ne4,b'r3kr2/ppp1q2p/2n3p1/3pP3/4n3/2P2NQ1/PP2N1PP/R1R3K1 w q -',He guards the pawn with his knight but now I can move my knight to e4 and attack his queen.
76,5,25,1Qh3,b'r3kr2/ppp1q2p/2n3p1/3pP3/4n3/2P2N1Q/PP2N1PP/R1R3K1 b q -',He moves his queen out of the way but now he is eying my h7 pawn so I can't go for the e pawn right away because now my queen has to guard my h7 pawn and now coincidentally I can't castle my king to safety.  
77,5,26,1Ng3,b'r3kr2/ppp1q3/2n3p1/3pP2p/4n3/2P2NNQ/PP4PP/R1R3K1 b q -',For a few moves now in the back of my head I saw that i could check his king with my queen but now I see something even better. It took me a long time to figure this out but if somehow I can get him to  move his f3 knight away from guarding the d4 space then I've got this game won.
78,5,27,1Nxe5,b'r3kr2/ppp1q3/6p1/3pn2p/4n3/2P2NNQ/PP4PP/R1R3K1 w q -',So after about 5 or 10 minutes debating the outcomes of what would happen if he didn't take on e5; I figured that i would come out ahead with at least a pawn advantage so I went for it.
79,5,28,1Nxe5,b'r3kr2/ppp1q3/6p1/3pN2p/4n3/2P3NQ/PP4PP/R1R3K1 b q -',Yes he took it. I was so happy when he took because I couldn't believe that I was able to see this forced mate and its my favorite kind of mate. 
80,5,29,1Qc5+,b'r3kr2/ppp5/6p1/2qpN2p/4n3/2P3NQ/PP4PP/R1R3K1 w q -',After I checked him I told the guy that it had been a good game and he saw what the outcome was and just resigned.  I think you can pretty much figure out what the forced mate is but just in case it is: 19...Qc5+ 20. Kh1 Nf2+ 21. Kg1 Nxh3+ 22. Kh1 Qg1+ 23. Rxg1 Nf2# Smothered Mate baby. This is one of my favorite games that I have played because at times I really felt I had to work hard to figure out my moves.  Also this is the first time I have ever been able to do a smothered mate which makes it pretty.  Please make comments I'll take any opinions or advice that anyone has to give.  Also this is my first annotated game so could you please rate this .

Most certainly don't want to move Nxe4 as white would surely follow with Bxg7 and taking on h6 the following move giving white much better board positioning.

I honestly didn't see the Qg5 possibility until reviewing the game so I was in panic mode to move to b6 and was pleasantly pleased at the time with white not taking my c pawn.

A couple minor move errors but due to piece positioning white couldn't overcome being down that one pawn and was constantly playing defense the whole game.  Both games we played were very well played splitting the series as each won as black.

The move also clears the back row for black.  White has a terrific positional advantage though - it still seems inconceivable that he will end up on the losing side.

I will soon be studying Dana Mackenzie's How to Save Lost Postions so I am glad I went through this game. Pearl frustrated Freddy enormously and I think this could have resulted in Freddy missing that tactical shot which should have nailed the game down in his favour so all credit to Pearl for pulling this one off!  Hope you have all had an enjoyable read - I have!  Bye for now - Joanne
402,21,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',These opening moves are book moves of Guico Piano.
403,21,1,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Be3 becomes Hungarian Defence.
404,21,2,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White is planning to convert this in Ruy Lopes as his plan is to move his Bishop to b5.  The game would progress as a6 Ba4 b5 Bb3 Na5 and Bc2.  So to make the space to Bishop move c3 is essential or else Black will capture the White's Bishop and will create the weakness by creating double pawn on 'b' file as White will have to capture the Knight by one of his a2 or c2 pawn.
405,21,3,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Normal development move.  Also preaparing for King side castling.
406,21,4,Bd3,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This move is a violation of chess opening principles that in the opening stage one should not move the same piece twice unless the development of all the pieces is complete.  Bc4 to Bd3 also doesn't show any further game plan.  In chess each move must have some purpose or game plan i.e. either development attack pin fork etc.  It will be seen further that how this single move slowed down White's development. 
407,21,5,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',d5 has two purposes.  One is a development move and opening the diagonal of Bishop at c8.  Another purpose is if white doesn't play e4xd5 then to take e4 pawn with d5 pawn and fork White's Knight & Bishop with a pawn.  White has to loose a piece as after d5xe4 the knight at f6 is supporting e4 square.
408,21,6,exd5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/8/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',White correctly plays e4xd5.
409,21,7,Nxd5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3np3/8/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',By playing knf6xd5 another chess principle is followed i.e. never bring out Queen at the early stage of the game unless it is creating mating threat.  If Queen comes out at d5 White can simply develop his game by attacking the Queen with Bc4 or b3 etc and Black has no option but to move the Queen all over the board to save itself from attack.  This will result in complete development of White's pieces and Black's development will be completely hampered due to Queen's continuous movement.
410,21,8,Be4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3np3/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Be4 has resulted Bishop's 3 moves from opening.  It means White has lost 2 opportunities of developing his other pieces.  Whereas Black is about to complete the development of all pieces by moving Bishop at c8 and then kingside castle.  The violation of opening principle of chess of not moving the same piece again and again unless the development is completed is causing troubles in white's development.
411,21,9,d3,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/2n1b3/3np3/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This is most ideal situation for black as his entire development except castling is complete.  At present their is no threat to Black's king and hence Black has an option to develop the game further and do the castling either at Kingside or Queen side depending on situation.  White's Bishop and Knight at c1 and b1 are not yet developed.  In fact white always need to maintain the first move advantage.
412,21,10,Nf6,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/2n1bn2/4p3/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This is first time that Black's Knight has moved twice but it is perfectly fine as f6 is a natural square for g8 knight.  The previous move of knight i.e. f6xd5 was for capturing the pawn and to avoid bringing Queen on the open board at the early stage of the game.
413,21,11,h6,b'r3k2r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p1B1/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Finally White's long awaited Bishop is developed.  Black do not want his knight to be pinned for long and hence White's Bishop is attacked by h6.
414,21,12,1Be3,b'r3k2r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p3/4B3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Now again a violation of Chess principle by taking back Bishop at e3.  Remember that White's knight at b1 is not yet developed but by playing Bishop to g5 allowed Black to develop his pawn at h6.  Pawn at h6 is very important move for Black if he intent to castle king side.  If White would not have played Bishop to g5 then black would have spent one move in future for playing h6.  However here White himself is helping Black to develop his game by violating the principles.
415,21,13,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p3/4B3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - -',Now by castling Black's development is technically completed in all respects.  Black's all pieces are active on Board and king is placed at safe place by castling.  Now Black has an advantage of deciding further game plan and white is still struggling for development.
416,21,14,1Bxc6,b'2kr3r/pppqbpp1/2B1bn1p/4p3/8/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Now again this was completely unwarranted move as White's Knight at b1 is still not developed.  Since White's knight is not developed White's Rook at a1 cant move and the ideal concept of connected Rooks is not possible for White.  White's Bishop is moved 4th time in the game without completion of development.
417,21,15,1Nbd2,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q1bn1p/4p3/8/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',After queen captures Bishop White's knight finally moves at 13th move of the game.  Self invited underdevelopment and giving the opponent an edge over the game. Also Knight's move at d2 is wrong as it is taking away Queen's protection to d3 pawn.  Black can now capture the free pawn at d3 by its Rook at d8.  What a blunder.  This is what happens if the pieces are not developed at the opening stage.  Here now White do not have any game plan and he want to take out his knight.  He cant take out his knight at a3 as Black will capture it with it's Bishop at e7 thereby creating weakness for White as White need to capture Bishop with its b2 pawn resulting in Double Pawn.
418,21,16,1Bf5,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q2n1p/4pb2/8/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black doesn't capture the pawn at d3 with his Rook as it is possible that White will attack the Rook with it's Queen and then Black will probably have to take back the Rook at d8 thereby loosing one move and allowing White to develop his Queen.  So White's pawn is double attacked by Black's Bishop and Rook.  Black has given up his pawn at e5 as his intention is to attack and break open the center by capturing d3 pawn.  Also if White captures e5 pawn it gives Black an open file for his Rook.  Remember Rooks are very powerful in open files and for positioning it correctly pawn sacrifice is worth. Also if White captures the pawn Black can bring his queen into attack i.e. 3rd attack on d3 pawn and then it would become impossible for White to hold on the center and Black would be in complete control of the center.
419,21,17,1Nxe5,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q2n1p/4Nb2/8/2PPB3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White is happy to capture free pawn at e5 as expected.
420,21,18,1Qd5,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3qNb2/8/2PPB3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black continues with the game plan of concentrating on the center.  By moving Queen to d5 Black is also protecting a Knight fork at f7 on both Black's Rooks.
421,21,19,1d4,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3qNb2/3P4/2P1B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White trying to hold the center.  Here it should be noted that Black's Queen is also eyeing on a2 pawn and White must protect that pawn with his Rook.  Most unwanted situation for white that a very strong piece like Rook is occupied in protecting a simple pawn.
422,21,20,1Ne4,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/7p/3qNb2/3Pn3/2P1B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Now Black starts advancing his army into the White's camp.  
423,21,21,1c4,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/7p/3qNb2/2PPn3/4B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White attempting to drive away a very powerful placed Queen at center.
424,21,22,1Qe6,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/4q2p/4Nb2/2PPn3/4B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Moving Queen at d6 would be great blunder as it allows White to fork Black's both Rooks and a Queen by playing Knight captures f7.  Here another chess principle comes in picture that when you move your pieces you must double check before moving it that what function that piece was performing at that particulat square.  Is it attacking Opponent's piece or is it blocking Opponent's pawn or piece development or whether it is supporting your own pieces or pawns and preventing Opponent's attacks.
425,21,23,1Nxe4,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/4q2p/4Nb2/2PPN3/4B3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Here White has applied another chess principle that if you are ahead in material start trading down the pieces and take the game to the end game.  The White is one pawn up and hence now it is correct for him to exchange the material and reduce further attack potentials of the Black.
426,21,24,1Bxe4,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/4q2p/4N3/2PPb3/4B3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black's normal reply.
427,21,25,1b3,b'2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/4q2p/4N3/2PPb3/1P2B3/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"Again violation of principles.  It should be noted here that White has not developed his Queen yet and pushing a pawn at b3 can be played at any other time.  Here now Black get chance to recover a pawn as White cannot bring his Rooks in play in the ""d"" file as White's own Queen is sitting in between the two Rooks.  It is known principle that the Rooks should normally be connected."
428,21,26,1Bf6,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4qb1p/4N3/2PPb3/1P2B3/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',By attacking Knight Black is attempting to recover a pawn as follows : Bf6xe5 d4xe5 Qe6xe5.
429,21,27,1Nf3,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4qb1p/8/2PPb3/1P2BN2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Realising this White avoid trading down the material.  But this gives Black an opportunity to double attack the pawn at d4 by Bishop at f6 and Rook at d8.  Black also can bring his Queen in action by bringing it in d file thereby creating 3rd attack.
430,21,28,1Bxf3,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4qb1p/8/2PP4/1P2Bb2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Black captures Knight hoping that White will capture the Bishop by Queen as White would not prefer opening his castle by capturing Black's Bishop by pawn at g2.  If white captures Black's Bishop at f3 then Black succeeds in recovering a pawn by capturing pawn at d4 as Black has two attacks of Bishop at f6 and Rook at d8.
431,21,29,2Qxf3,b'2kr3r/ppp2pp1/4qb1p/8/2PP4/1P2BQ2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - -',As expected White blunders by capturing the Bishop with his Queen.  Note here the principle discussed before that you must take into consideration the function that each piece or pawn is performing at a particular square.  Here White's Queen at d1 was supporting the pawn at d4 along with support of Bishop at e3.  But by moving Queen one support to pawn at d4 is removed and now Black can easily recover the pawn with his Bishop at f6 and Rook at d4. White has ignored this principle.
432,21,30,Rxd4,b'2k4r/ppp2pp1/4q2p/8/2Pr4/1P3Q2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - -',As per the plans Black recovers the pawn.  Also note that Black is in very strong position as his Rook and Queen are controlling the open files 'e' and 'd'.  Black also can create a Battery by bringing his Rook at h8 to either e8 or d8 depending on game plan.
433,21,31,2Rfe1,b'2k4r/ppp2pp1/4q2p/8/2Pr4/1P3Q2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Black's Queen is attacked by White's Rook.  
434,21,32,2Qd7,b'2k4r/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2Pr4/1P3Q2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black moves Queen to d7 with clear intention of creating a most powerful battery by playing Rh8 to d8 and preparing to storm at d1.
435,21,33,Rd8,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2PrR3/1P3Q2/P4PPP/R5K1 w - -',Black is executing his plans and has made a strong battery of Rooks and Queen in 'd' file.
436,21,34,2Ree1,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2Pr4/1P3Q2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Again violation of principle.  Note that White's Rook at a1 is still not moved.  The best position for a Rook is open file and White's Rook is sitting useless so long.  Instead of this move White could have very well developed his Rook at a1 to e1 thereby creating a battery.  But White continues moving same piece again and again without developing other pieces.
437,21,35,2Rd2,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2P5/1P3Q2/P2r1PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Correct application of principle by Black.  7th rank is most desirable place for the Rook.  Here Black's Rook is also eyeing on a2 pawn which White need to protect with his Rook.  If White wants to develop his Rook then he need to move a2 pawn to a4 thereby wasting one move.  
438,21,36,2a3,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2P5/PP3Q2/3r1PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',White choose to mobilise his Rook but again violation of principle of not observing the function of occupied square of the piece.  The pawn at a2 was supporting the pawn at b3 and by moving the pawn to a3 White's b3 pawn becomes unsupported.
439,21,37,2Rd3,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2P5/PP1r1Q2/5PPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black double attacks with his Rook to d3 by attacking Queen and Pawn.  White cant do anything as Black's Rook is well supported by Queen and another Rook at d8.  
440,21,38,2Qe2,b'2kr4/pppq1pp1/7p/8/2P5/PP1r4/4QPPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Queen moves to the safety.
441,21,39,2Qe6,b'2kr4/ppp2pp1/4q2p/8/2P5/PP1r4/4QPPP/R3R1K1 w - -',Black offers Queen's trading and attempts to take the game to the end game.  Another reason to do so is that White's Queen side pawns has come forward and it is risky for black to move his Queen side pawns as it would open the castle and White's Queen can enter the Black's camp.  If both Queens goes off the board Black can create counter play at Queen's side by moving pawns and keeping Rook's battery intact.

This move allowed Black to make in between silent move and waiting for white to completely block his pawns against Black's pawns.  Now Black can move his King to d5 but White cannot move his King as it is blocking Black's pass pawn.  White can at the most move his h2 pawn to h3 but black will continue to move his king to c5 and forcing White to either play h4 or move his king away from pass pawn.  If white plays h4 then Black's g5 pawn becomes pass pawn by g5xh4 and then White looses.  If White moves his King still white looses because Black's king will escort the c4 pawn to Queening square.  
459,21,57,4Kd5,b'8/2p5/7p/pP1kp1p1/P1p3P1/2K2P2/7P/8 w - -',Black continues his plan of forcing white to allow Black to proceed his pass pawn.
460,21,58,4h3,b'8/2p5/7p/pP1kp1p1/P1p3P1/2K2P1P/8/8 b - -',No other option for white.
461,21,59,4Kd2,b'8/2p5/7p/pPk1p1p1/P1p3P1/5P1P/3K4/8 b - -',Now realising the danger of playing h3 to h4 White prefers to step back.
462,21,60,4Kd4,b'8/2p5/7p/pP2p1p1/P1pk2P1/5P1P/3K4/8 w - -',Black's king preparing to escort the c4 pawn to Queening square.
463,21,61,4Kc1,b'8/2p5/7p/pP2p1p1/P2k2P1/2p2P1P/8/2K5 b - -',This was perfect move by White.  Move looks simple but deep calculation is involved.  Now if black palys King to d3 White will take the opposition by playing his King to d1. Black need to play his pawn to c2 and white's king comes back on c1.  Now black cannot progress further as d2 c2 and b2 squares are blocked by White's king.  Black cannot move any other pawn as it will create pass pawn for White and white will necessarily win by promoting the pawn to queen.  If black plays h6 to h5 whites g5 pawn becomes pass pawn.  If Black play c7 to c6 White's b5 pawn becomes pass pawn.  And if black moves his king away from the c2 pawn White captures the pass pawn.
464,21,62,4Ke3,b'8/2p5/7p/pP2p1p1/P5P1/2p1kP1P/8/2K5 w - -',Best move for Black to attack f3 pawn by giving up c3 pawn.  This is because if pass pawn need to reach its Queening square it is a must for Black's king to escort the pawn from e3 to e1 and also it is must for Black's king to occupy f2 square so that White's king doesn't reach e1 square for blocking the pass pawn.  Black is expecting White to move his king to c2 and then capture c3 pawn and in the mean time Black gets two moves to complete the sequence for promoting the e5 pawn to queening square.
465,21,63,4Kc2,b'8/2p5/7p/pP2p1p1/P5P1/2p1kP1P/2K5/8 b - -',As expected White attempts to capture c3 pawn.
466,21,64,Kf2,b'8/2p5/7p/pP4p1/P3p1P1/7P/3K1k2/8 w - -',Here White resigns as it is not possible for white to prevent Queening of e4 pawn as the important squares e1 e2 e3 are blocked by Black's Queen.  The White King cannot occupy any of these squares and cannot stop Queen promotion.

One drawback of this logical and probably most-played first move by White is that you have to face lots of responses (1...c5 ...e5 ...e6 ...c6 ...d6 ...g6 ...d5 ...Nf6 ...Nc6 are the most important possibilities for Black sorted by popularity according to the GameKnot Database [World]). However I like open games and have been to lazy to study queen-pawn openings (1. d4) so far to be honest ;-) Of course another tempting possibility is the English opening (1. c4) which seem to transpose in a reversed Sicilian quite often. Maybe I'll experiment with it in the future."

Nxc3 (another possibility is 4. Bc4 sacrificing two pawns) -- at this position White is a pawn down but has already developed a piece and a pawn in the center; the next step would be to place to bishop on c4 to put some pressure on f7.
481,23,5,Qxd4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -',Probably better and more usual here would have been e5. Bringing the queen out so early in the game breaks the opening rules and reminds me of the Scandinavian defence.

In the Scandinavian defence (1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3) Black also usually places the queen on this square: 3... Qa5.

Just before my big win over gocall1 (Ger) bumped my rating back into the 1800s I got this victory.  It was in the Traxler MT.  I think I have done shedloads better with the white pieces than with the black ones.  Anyhow it looked as if Julia my Team Captain had a very strong attack going down the kingside.  She then sacrificed the exchange.  This turned out to be a bad move.  I needed to be very patient though and the main theatre of the battle turned out to be the h column.  Eventually I managed to control the h column with Glenda and my rook.  Lastly my knight which for the best part of the game was doing not a lot came into f6 and had the last word before my opponent waved the white flag.  I will start further commentary on move 6."

It untangles Julia's queenside pawns but I am the exchange up and have just traded off another set of pieces so I think it was worth untangling those footmen.

This is good practice for when I next get to face a kingside/queenside mating attack from the Master Mater.  It will be interesting to see if he could crack this defense!

I think my next plan should be to move Henry back towards the centre of the board before I try any counter-play on the h column.

Julia susses it out and backs her knight off to g6.

549,24,33,4Ng4,b'6q1/3b1k2/pppp2nR/4p1PQ/PPP1PpN1/3P1P2/8/3K4 b - -',46. Ng4 - the most sensible move would be Nxg4 but that is trading off yet another set of pieces.  It does save the black knight though.

She must fly away on her broomstick and abandon that poor black steed to his fate.  Julia now waves the white flag.  Nice to have another game to report where I The Beginner with the Class A rating is on the attacking side.  I just hope I can put up a few more like this - cheers and bye for now - Joanne

My opponent realised that Old Matey that chessic Grim Reaper was not too far away and waved the white flag.  Unless Ger can beat al-fiere in his remaining match I will come top in my group of the Sneaky Knight's Team MT - that will be really nice!

The added space advantage that White has is nothing to sneeze at. Just by comparing the pieces in this position it's easy to figure that White has the upper hand.

870,38,36,Kd8,b'3k4/2R5/5p2/3N4/3P2P1/p3K3/P7/1q6 w - -',41. ... Qxa2 42. Nxf6+ is just giving White a tempo.  I can attack the rook because the Nd5 can't move.  Can White find a decent move?
871,38,37,4Ra7,b'3k4/R7/5p2/3N4/3P2P1/p3K3/P7/1q6 b - -',Obvious but nothing saves the a2 pawn.
872,38,38,4Nxf6+,b'R7/3k4/5N2/8/3P2P1/p3K3/q7/8 b - -',TIMEOUT: Suddenly White has two passed pawns a5-a4-a3 is looking useful my king is looking over-worked and the game is still unclear.  First things first (as my Dad would say) let's see about stopping that g-pawn.
873,38,39,4Nd7,b'8/3N1k2/R7/8/3P2P1/p3K3/q7/8 b - -',White tries to get his knight back to take a3.  If he can exchange his knight for the pawn I have problems.  The king can look after one of the pawns but the queen is going to struggle against the other one. 
874,38,40,4Qb1,b'8/3N1k2/R7/8/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 w - -',A relatively simple tactic.  47. Rxa3 Qc1+ means that White doesn't have time to get his knight back. 
875,38,41,4Ne5+,b'8/5k2/R7/4N3/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 b - -',even with checks.
876,38,42,4Ra7+,b'8/R3k3/8/4N3/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 b - -',TIMEOUT: Having said that I want my king to stop his g-pawn how do I make progress?
877,38,43,5Ra7+,b'8/R1k5/8/4N3/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 b - -',It's all very well bringing my king across to the Q-side but I'm going to have to dash back in a second.  Where do I go now?
878,38,44,5Kc8,b'2k5/R7/8/4N3/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 w - -',!  That's one of my best of the game.  50. ... Kb8? blows it.  51. Nc6+ Kc8 52. Ne7+ and my king has to head back to the K-side. 
879,38,45,Kb7,b'R7/1k6/8/4N3/3P2P1/p3K3/8/1q6 w - -',Now the king is safe from checks and White has to make a tough decision.  
880,38,46,Qxa3,b'8/1k6/8/4N3/3PK1P1/q7/8/8 w - -',Black is now clear material up but one slip and he'll lose this.  
881,38,47,5g5,b'8/1k6/8/4N1P1/3PK3/q7/8/8 b - -',White sensibly pushes the g-pawn.  What's the point of luring my king to the b-file otherwise?
882,38,48,Qf6,b'8/1k6/5qP1/4N3/3PK3/8/8/8 w - -',The zugzwang theme reappears.   That's g6 and e5 tied up whilst I get my king back into play.
883,38,49,5Ne5,b'8/4k3/5qP1/4N3/2KP4/8/8/8 b - -',Now my king can cover the g-pawn it's time to activate my queen again.
884,38,50,6Kb4,b'8/4k3/4q1P1/4N3/1K1P4/8/8/8 b - -',"Not good although the response isn't obvious. 
TIMEOUT:

60. Kc5 Qd6+ 61. Kc4 Qe6+ 62. Kc5 Qc8+ 63. Nc6+ Kf6 64. d5 Qf5 is another use of the zugzwang.
60. Kc3 Qd5 61. Kd3 Qb3+ 62. Ke4 Ke6 forces something to give.  Interestingly in these lines the g6 pawn has to sit and await its fate as g7 leaves it too exposed. 

What's Black's next move after 60. Kb4?"
885,38,51,6Qc8,b'2q5/4k3/6P1/4N3/1K1P4/8/8/8 w - -',Separating the white king from the d4 pawn.
886,38,52,Kf6,b'2q5/8/5kP1/4N3/3P4/1K6/8/8 w - -',More zugzwang.  White can't play g6-g7 or Ne5-anywhere or d4-d5
887,38,53,Qc7,b'8/2q5/5kP1/4N3/3P4/8/1K6/8 w - -',Another little waiting move.  Hands up if you saw that one.  Be honest.
888,38,54,Qc1,b'8/8/5kP1/4N3/3P4/1K6/8/2q5 w - -',Because you all wanted to play that didn't you?
889,38,55,Qc2,b'8/8/5kP1/4N3/1K1P4/8/2q5/8 w - -',Oh yes.  White is squeeeezed.
890,38,56,6Nc4,b'8/8/5kP1/8/1KNP4/8/2q5/8 b - -',White's pips burst g6 drops and Black moves inexorably towards his goal.  65. Kb5 Qc3 carries Black's plan to its end d4 falls and the game is over.
891,38,57,Kf7,b'8/5k2/8/3P4/1KN5/8/2q5/8 w - -',The king keeps busy.
892,38,58,Qd1,b'8/4k3/8/3P4/1KN5/8/8/3q4 w - -',Repositioning the queen for one final invasion.
893,38,59,6Kc5,b'8/4k3/8/2KP4/2N5/8/8/3q4 b - -',"White finally has enough and resigns.  0-1

I'm still not sure whether it's premature - the win isn't immediately obvious although Qh5 (preventing d6) 70. Kc6 Qe8+ gets the queen back around to the correct side of the pawn and allows the king to go on a foray after the White knight whereupon I should be able to pick up the pawn.  After that blunders aside the knight will fall and the game will end.  "

905,39,11,2Be3,b'r5k1/3b1ppp/2p5/pp1p4/1b1n4/1PN1BP2/N5PP/5RK1 b - -',maybe he doesn't know how to defend!!

910,39,16,3Rd3,b'6k1/3b1ppp/2p5/1p6/8/3R1P2/5KPP/2r5 b - -',true to his style his last move is an attacking move!!
911,39,17,3Be8,b'4b1k1/5ppp/2p5/1p6/8/3R1P2/5KPP/2r5 w - -',well my opponent either got tired of attacking or realized how pathetic/predictable his future attacks were going to be and resigned!! what did we learn from this? is that you can't win a game if you can't defend! lol!! but the thing i will remember about this game is that my opponent is rated 1800+ but yet he played so poorly!!
