11,0,11,Kg7,b'8/1pr1r1kp/3R2p1/2P5/b3Pp2/2R2P2/5K1P/5B2 w - -',Ah! I concluded my King is exposed to check along the back ranks of 7 & 8. Furthermore I had foreseen my f pawn being a lil' too weak by itself and either needed protection by either King-g5 or etc. With this theme in mind I said my King needs to vamoose to h6

White can't castle king's side (Bb6 puts the king in check) but most folks would have gone with Pg4.  Black is kind of compelled to move the queen and cannot simply take the poisoned g pawn (now guarded by the white queen).
38,2,1,1Ba2,b'r1b2rk1/ppb1nppp/2p3q1/P2pp3/1P2P3/2PP1PN1/B1Q3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Bb3 would have given white's white bishop greater freedom of movement without constraining the a rook either.
39,2,2,Re8,b'r1b1r1k1/p3nppp/1bp3q1/3pp3/4P3/B1PP1PN1/B1Q3PP/R4R1K w - -',Here I would trade black bishop for knight--BxNe7.  Then Rf to B1.  The long term goal is RxBb6 (after the white bishop is moved).  Although protected by the pawn black can't take it because then RxR.
40,2,3,3Bd2,b'2b1q1k1/2b3p1/8/p1pP1p2/1rP2p1p/3P4/2QB1RPP/5N1K b - -',How about BxPf4?  Free pawn.  Ra4 makes Bd2 a hollow threat.
41,2,4,3Bc3,b'1rb1q1k1/2b3p1/8/p1pP1p2/2P2p1p/2BP4/2Q2RPP/5N1K b - -',I still liked BxPf4 better.  BxB RxB white comes out a pawn ahead.
42,2,5,Rb1,b'6k1/2bb2p1/8/p2P1p2/2PBqp1p/8/3Q1RPP/1r3N1K w - -',The game seems far from lost.

I started this annotation at least 3 earlier times and became discouraged during the process.

104,5,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',While I and Jack don't play this it's a well known variation the English Opening.
105,5,1,b6,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I don't know why black played this but it is out of book.  It's actually similar to the Sodium attack which would happen had white played 1.e4  Instead the most common response here is 1...e4 so now you have a reversed Sicilian as the Sicilian is 1.e4 c4
106,5,2,Qc2,b'rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',?! While the analysis doesn't mention anything in my mind this is an inaccuracy.  Of course not every single guideline should be followed as there's so many that sometimes conflict with one another.  The only idea behind it is to get your pieces out castle and establish mobility.  And there are also exceptions where it must be broken to win material of it leads to mate or losing material.  This isn't one and in my mind this is the most important guideline of them all.  I don't know why black got his Q out this early as nothing's being threatened.  But it does not develop nor help him with development.  Now chicoboy can use that time to get his pieces into a play while white wasted time with this move.  With it black should have a small advantage at this point. 
107,5,3,d5,b'rn1qk1nr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq d6',?! I understand the idea behind this move.  It's the exchange variation and normally it would be a very strong move because it develops a center pawn which is needed to open lines for the B and control the center.  However this is a time where guidelines must be broken.  That's because according to the analysis it is an inaccuracy.  Best in this position was 5...Nf6  Then this could happen.  6.e3 0-0 7.Bd3 c5 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.Qxc3 Bxf3 10.gxf3 cxd4 11.exd4 Nc6 12.Rg1 g6 and black has a slightly stronger structure.
108,5,4,e3,b'rn1qk1nr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',This would be the best response had black played 5...Nf6 as noted earlier.  But according to what I saw the best response to 5...d5 is 6.cxd5 6...exd5 7.e3 Nc6 8.a3 Be7 9.Bb5 a6 10.Bxc6+ Bxc6 11.0-0 Nf6 12.Ne5 Bd7 13.Bd2  So white gets to exchange black's N for a B.  Now I learned that B's are generally worth more then N's.  However I also learned from Jack that usually N's are worth more B's.  Now Jack showed me a game between GM's Petrosian who was the world champion at the time and Spassky.  It was both even but Petrosian lost.  He went wrong by giving up by exchanging his N for Spassky's B.  That's because as it turned out Petrosians N was worth more and dangerous.  In fact that would've been the killer and had he not exchanged Petrosian would've won.  And on a much smaller believe it or not this position is somewhat similar.  So I understand what's going on and had this happened where titho got a N for his B he would've had the advantage.  And that is why 5...d5?! was an inaccuracy.  Note: That against much stronger players just one inaccuracy can make a big difference.  And what I recently learned is that it generally only takes one mistake to make or break a game.  For example Tom recently played against a Master.  He was outplaying him the entire time with a winning advantage as Tom was a piece up.  However he only made one blunder and that was enough to turn everything around.  It allowed the Master to pull a swindle and win the game.  Had this mistake not been made it would've been an easy win for Tom.
109,5,5,1O-O-O,b'r2qk1nr/pbpn1p2/1p4pp/3p4/3P4/2BBPN2/PPQ2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',!? In my opinion this is a risky move especially in this position.  And I don't think that white had a good reason for castling long as opposed to K side.  In general with pawns surrounding the K it's better to castle K side because it is said that castling Q side puts you at risk of K exposure.  I feel that it is especially the case here.  It's now a similar position to a past game against Jack and I had the option of castling K side or Q side.  Well I decided to like here castle long and that is what sealed my fate.  Note: In that game the Sicilian like usual was played and by playing ...0-0-0 I wound up exposing my K. 
110,5,6,1a3,b'r3k2r/pbpnqp2/1p4pp/3p4/3Pn2N/P1BBP1P1/1PQ2P1P/2KR3R b kq -',"According to the analysis this is an inaccuracy.  Instead best was 14.a3 with the idea of 14...0-0-0 15.Bxe4 dxe4 16.Qb3 Qg5 17.Qc4 Rfc8 18.Qe2 Re8 19.Qc4 c6 20.Bb4 Qd5  This time I disagree with it.  First it's not the beginning game and everyone has completed development.  Second in my opinion this was thitho's best move.  It's a somewhat similar position to my game against Jack yesterday.  But what happened was that I was in trouble and my coach was threatening mate.  Therefore I had to give my K air to breath on the b file.  Then there was more trouble so I played a3  Jack said ""This is a very strong move.""  What he was implying was that it was the best move.  That's because not only did I get out of trouble but I also established a very strong pawn structure like this.  Right now I believe that white is playing extremely well so far. "
111,5,7,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pbpn1p2/1p2q1pp/3p4/3P3N/P1QBP1P1/1P3P1P/1K1R3R w - -',In this position however I feel that Gerhard made the right choice by castling Q side.  The structure is what you'd typically see if one castled K side.  The idea being is that black structure meaning his material is surrounding and protecting his K whereas on the K side there is already a weakness as the pawns providing a lot of coverage for the K.  With that I feel that black is now much safer and despite material even black already has an advantage.
112,5,8,1Bb5,b'2kr3r/pbpn1p2/1p2q1pp/1B1p4/3P3N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1K1R3R b - -',?? Another inaccuracy according to the analysis.  But in my opinion this is actually a blunder as I'll explain on the next move.  The best move from what I saw was 17.Ng2  Then comes something like 17...c6 18.Nf4 Qd6 19.Rc1 Nf6 20.f3 Rd7 21.h4 Re8 22.Rhe1 Rc7 23.Qd2 Rce7 24.b4
113,5,9,1c6,b'2kr3r/pb1n1p2/1pp1q1pp/1B1p4/3P3N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1K1R3R w - -',According to the analysis best was 17...g5  Then it would be followed up with e.g. 18.Rc1 c5 19.dxc5 Nxc5 20.Rhg1 gxh4 21.b4 hxg3 22.Rxg3 a6 23.bxc5 axb5 24.cxb6+ Kb8 25.Qc5 Qf5+ 26.Rc2  So black would've won a piece for a pawn which is why 17.Bb5?? was a blunder.
114,5,10,c5,b'2kr3r/pb1n1p2/1p2q1pp/1Bpp4/3P3N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1KR4R w - -',"? I'm not going to keep going over variations because there are three of these in a row.  What's important however is the concepts that go into them as that's how you tie theory into all of this.  Accordingly this is a mistake because it should lose a pawn after 19.dxc5 Nxc5 20.f3 Kb8 21.b4 d4 22.Qb2 Nb3 23.Bc4 Be4+ 24.fxe4 Qxe4+ 25.Qc2 Nd2+ 26.Kb2 Qxc2+ 27.Rxc2 Nxc4+ 28.Rxc4 dxe3  After looking at it I agree.  Best then would be 18...Kb8 as then 19.Bd3 c5 20.Ng2 c4 21.Bc2 Qg4 22.Rcf1 Nf6 23.f3 Qg5 24.Nf4 Rhe8 25.Rc1 a5 and ...""Everything holds"" as Jack would say.  Meaning: That everything would still be safe.   "
115,5,11,1Bxd7+,b'2kr3r/pb1B1p2/1p2q1pp/2pp4/3P3N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1KR4R b - -',Best was 19.dxc5+ for the reason outlined above.
116,5,12,1Kxd7,b'3r3r/pb1k1p2/1p2q1pp/2pp4/3P3N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1KR4R w - -',!? The analysis gives this as an inaccuracy as it loses a pawn because of what's about to unfold.  Instead best was 19...Rxd7 20.Rhe1 c4 21.e4 Kb8 22.exd5 Qxd5 23.Qxc4 Qxd4 24.Qxd4 Rxd4 25.f3 Rc8 26.Rxc8+ Kxc8 27.Re7  However as I will explain shortly I don't completely agree with the analysis as it doesn't have to be a free pawn.  There's a way out of it.  However I do feel that this capture is risky because it leaves black K a little susceptible to exposure when it blocks the d R and now if white is ever able to find a move that would place chicoboy in check he'll have a harder time getting the K to safety.
117,5,13,Rdc8,b'2r4r/pb1k1p2/1p2q1pp/2Pp4/7N/P1Q1P1P1/1P3P1P/1KR4R w - -',? I don't know why he moved here but this is the move that loses a pawn.  Instead best was to recapture at once with 20...bxc5  
118,5,14,g5,b'2r4r/pb1k1p2/1p2q2p/2Pp2p1/3Q3N/P3P1P1/1P3P1P/1KR4R w - -',Understandable wanting to drive that N away and gaining tempo.  But why do that when you can win something back.  As it turns out 21...bxc5! would have done that.
119,5,15,Rhe8,b'2r1r3/pb1k1p2/1p2q2p/2Pp2p1/3Q4/P3P1P1/1P3PNP/1KR4R w - -',"The idea I believe was to attack the center which is generally a good strategy.  Why?  Well as I learned from wrecking_ball in ""The Deeper Chess Theory Club"" from the snap shot analysis thread attacking the center is another way to control.  And since Gerhard put one of the R's on the e file it's right in the center doing a little damage on the e file.  However best as the analysis puts it is 22...bxc5  Do note that he also could have played this earlier.  With this move the opportunity is gone due to white's next move."
120,5,16,Qe5,b'2r1r3/pb1k1p2/1p5p/2Ppq1p1/3Q4/P3P1P1/1P3PNP/1KRR4 w - -',! Best as this move protects black d pawn once and for all.
121,5,17,3Ng7,b'8/5pN1/bp6/2kp2pp/8/P1K1PPP1/1P5P/8 b - -',According to the Analysis this is an inaccuracy.  Well I agree but at the same time disagree.  I don't think that there was anything wrong with the move played.  However best is still 36.b4!  Now it looks bad because you'd think that with this move black white will lose another pawn.  But that isn't as it would be a good gambit (useful sac that would be useful to promote a pawn and guarantee a win for black.)  Here's how.  After white checks with the b pawn 36...Kc6 37.Kd4 Kb5 38.Nd6+ Ka4 39.Nxf7 Kxa3 40.Nxg5 Kxb4 41.Kxd5 Bb7+ 42.Kd4 Ka3 43.e4 b5 44.e5 b4 45.e6 b3  And no matter how drawish it looks for the powerful pawns black has an easy way to promote it and he can do something to prevent white from promoting due to his LSB.  It's very similar to the position on my actual game against Jack not the annotated version.  By that I allude to my epic and historic game against my coach where I learned just how important thinking ahead is in chess and life and why I'm still a very serious chess player.  Because this is also how I learned the extent that chess really stretches and imagination.  In the actual game I had two pawns+ my K.  But he had his LSB a P and his K.  Despite it looking like a won game for me it was just the opposite because Jack was much closer to promoting a pawn.  It was only about two ranks from the promotion square whereas I had three or four ranks to go.  Plus the promotion would have occurred on the light square so were I to promote he'd be able to stop it cold with his LSB.  This end would be to an extent a similar position.
122,5,18,Bd7,b'4N3/3b1p2/1pk5/3p4/1P1K1P1p/P3P3/7P/8 w - -',For some reason the analysis gives this as an inaccuracy because of what white is about to play.  According to what I saw best was 41...Bd1  I don't agree with it as I don't like the B crammed on my square.  In fact what thitho does is not going to be a problem for black.  And I also would've played this if I were black.
123,5,19,4e4,b'8/5p2/1pk1bN2/3p4/1P1KPP1p/P7/7P/8 b - -',? The analysis gives this move as a mistake.  In my mind it isn't but rather a small inaccuracy.  Best accordingly was 43.Ke5  The only reason I agree with this is that white should win another pawn with a little liquidation on top of that without anything for black to follow up on supposedly.  After titho would play Ke5 we have something like 43...Bh3 44.Nxd5! Bg2 45.Nc3 Bf1 46.a4 Bc4 47.e4 h3 48.Nd5 Bb3 49.a5 bxa5 50.bxa5 Kb5 51.Kf6 Kc5 52.Nc3
124,5,20,b5,b'8/5p2/2k1b3/1p6/1P1KNP1p/P7/7P/8 w - -',For whatever reason the analysis gives marks this as an inaccuracy because of 45.Ke5 Kd7 46.f5 Bc4 47.Kd4 Bf1 48.Kc5 Ke7 49.Nd6 Kf6 50.Nxb5 Kxf5 51.Nd6+ Ke6 52.a4 f5 53.b5 f4 54.a5 f3  I disagree with it because this line gives black a winning advantage as now that f pawn promotes.  I don't know the theory behind it so I'll just get to it based on what the computer suggests.  So apparently the best move was 44...Bb3 and then would come perhaps 45.Ke5 Kb5 46.Kd6 Bc2 47.Nc3+ Ka6 48.Kc6 b5 49.Nd5 Be4 50.Kc5 Bxd5 51.Kxd5 Kb6 52.f5 h3 53.Kd6 f6  Whether or not is completely remains to be seen.  But in my mind this is a very strong move preventing white from advancing b pawn any further.
125,5,21,Kd7,b'4N3/3k1p2/8/1p2K3/1P3P1p/P4b2/7P/8 w - -',Accordingly this is an inaccuracy but I don't agree with that. The idea being: 48.Ng7 Kc7 49.Nf5 h3 50.Nd4 Bc6 51.Nxc6 Kxc6 52.f5 Kd7 53.Kd5 Ke7 54.Kc6 Kf6 55.Kxb5 Kxf5 56.Kc5 Ke5 57.b5 f5  That leaves with the best move being 47...Be2 as then 48.Nf6 Bd3 49.Ne4 Bxe4 50.Kxe4 Kd6 51.Kf5 Kd5 52.Kf6 Ke4 53.Kxf7 Kxf4 54.Ke6 Ke4 55.Kd6 Kd4 56.Kc6 Kc4 57.h3 Kc3  And I absolutely agree with that because as the analysis in the long run 47...Kd7 is what will help black to achieve the opposition when we reach the endgame.  As I've learned from Jack in the endgame you generally want to strive for the opposition as it will give you a stronger position.
126,5,22,4Nd6,b'8/3k1p2/3N4/1p2K3/1P3P1p/P4b2/7P/8 b - -',I disagree with analysis but apparently as I don't see anything wrong with the move played.  In fact I view as one of white's best moves.  But apparently it's an error because after the exchange the threat would eventually become 50.Kg7 Ke6 51.Kg6 Be4+ 52.Kg5 h3 53.Kg4 Bg2 54.Kg5 Bf1 55.f5+ Kf7 56.Kf4 Kf6 57.Kg4 Ke5 58.Kg5
127,5,23,Kc4,b'8/8/8/1p3PK1/1Pk1b3/P6p/7P/8 w - -',?? The computer only gives it as a mistake.  But in my mind this is a blunder which should cost black the game.  The reason being is 54.Kg4 Kd4 55.f6 Bd5 56.Kxh3 Ke5 57.Kg4 Kxf6 58.Kf4 Bb3 59.Kg4 Bd1+ 60.Kf4 Bc2 61.Kg4 Kg6 62.Kf4 Kh5 63.Ke5 Kg4  Despite being a pawn up in that position white would have two passed pawns with one proving to be unstoppable.  And this is why Jack taught me as noted in previous annotations to be aware of passed pawns.  There actually more dangerous then they might appear especially if you have more then one making one unstoppable where it will promote as would be the case there.  That leaves the best move being 53...Ke5 as black Gerhard would win another pawn.  54.f6 Ke6 55.Kg4 Bg2 56.Kg5 Kf7 57.Kf5 Bd5 58.Ke5 Be6 59.Kd6 Kxf6 60.Kc5 Bd7 61.Kb6 Ke6 62.Kc5 Kf5 63.Kd5 Be6+
128,5,24,5f6,b'8/8/5P2/1p4K1/1Pk1b3/P6p/7P/8 b - -',?? This as the computer shows is a blunder.  Best was either 54.Kg4 as it wins material.  But with this move black should win this game.  The idea being is that once black stops this dangerous pawn with 54...Bd5 no matter what white does Gerhard in the long run will have a pawn that'll prove to be unstoppable and will henceforth be able to promote.
129,5,25,5Kg6,b'8/8/5PK1/1p1b4/1Pk5/P6p/7P/8 b - -',"?? As is explained in the analysis this is the losing blunder.  With this move no matter how you slice chicoboy will be able to compensate for the lost pawn.  Not only will he do this by winning back material but now one of his pawns will prove unstoppable as he now has the opportunity to Q forcing white into resignation.  Therefore best in this position was 55.Kh4 as then 55...Be6 56.f7 Bxf7 57.Kxh3 Kb3 58.Kg4 Kxa3 59.Kg5 Kxb4 60.Kf6 Be8 61.Ke7 Bh5 62.Kf6 Kc5 63.h4 b4 64.Kg5 b3 65.Kxh5  And now ""everything holds"" as Jack would say."
130,5,26,b4,b'8/8/8/2K5/1p6/2k4p/7P/8 w - -',At this point white waved and what he said was ''as I now cannot stop you from from promoting I resign'' The morals of this game are to develop your pieces before you bring out the Q unless there is an extenuating circumstance which wasn't the case here.  And if your opponent has a passed pawn do something about it right away before it becomes a killer.  As noted in previous annotations Jack Stockel has advised me to be weary of passed pawns because they're dangerous and this is a perfect example of why.  Afterall I made a very similar mistake in that game by allowing him to have a passed pawns which in that game couldn't be stopped.  As a result I was forced to resign for exactly the same reason that thitho resigned here.  The thing is that passed pawns are what often promote which is why they're things to be weary of.  So if you don't figure out how to stop a passed pawn it will be able to promote.  And that will create problems and often cost you the game as was the case here.

341,12,63,3Kg7,b'1r6/5pkp/p5q1/3QP3/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 w - -',I thought I was doing the same but....
342,12,64,3e6,b'1r6/5pkp/p3P1q1/3Q4/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 b - -',He now comes up with this.
343,12,65,3fxe6,b'1r6/6kp/p3p1q1/3Q4/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 w - -',I take innocently.
344,12,66,3Qe5+,b'1r6/6kp/p3p1q1/4Q3/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 b - -',and he plays this fork.
345,12,67,3Kh6,b'1r6/7p/p3p1qk/4Q3/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 w - -',King moves.
346,12,68,3Qxb8,b'1Q6/7p/p3p1qk/8/P1B5/6PP/5PK1/8 b - -',The rook goes.
347,12,69,3Qe4+,b'1Q6/7p/p3p2k/8/P1B1q3/6PP/5PK1/8 w - -',But his bishop is a gonna too. We are going into a queen and pawn  endgame where he is a pawn up. Interestingly after 29.....Bxc3? PMCA doesn't suggest any improvements for either side from move 29 to the end of the game. So although I didn't see some of the tactics maybe there wasn't anything better for me...
348,12,70,3Kh2,b'1Q6/7p/p3p2k/8/P1B1q3/6PP/5P1K/8 b - -',So his king moves.
349,12,71,3Qxc4,b'1Q6/7p/p3p2k/8/P1q5/6PP/5P1K/8 w - -',His bishop goes.
350,12,72,3Qb2,b'8/7p/p3p2k/8/P1q5/6PP/1Q3P1K/8 b - -',With a clever sacrifice. If 37....Qxa4?? 38. Qf6+ Kh5 39. g4 wins for white. But I didn't fall for that....
351,12,73,3Kg6,b'8/7p/p3p1k1/8/P1q5/6PP/1Q3P1K/8 w - -',So I centralise my king. There are not any major worries now. I just have to be careful not to allow a queen exchange nor to lose any pawns.
352,12,74,3a5,b'8/7p/p3p1k1/P7/2q5/6PP/1Q3P1K/8 b - -',He now moves the a pawn to a safer square.
353,12,75,3h5,b'8/8/p3p1k1/P6p/2q5/6PP/1Q3P1K/8 w - h6',I want to exchange pawns if I can. I played this with a view of perhaps playing h5-h4 or exchanging if he plays g3-g4 at some stage.
354,12,76,3Qb6,b'8/8/pQ2p1k1/P6p/2q5/6PP/5P1K/8 b - -',He keeps the pressure on my pawns.
355,12,77,3Kf5,b'8/8/pQ2p3/P4k1p/2q5/6PP/5P1K/8 w - -',I move my king up
356,12,78,4Qb7,b'8/1Q6/p3p3/P4k1p/2q5/6PP/5P1K/8 b - -',I am not sure why he played that
357,12,79,4Qe2,b'8/1Q6/p3p3/P4k1p/8/6PP/4qP1K/8 w - -',My queen takes up an ideal square protecting all three pawns and threatening Qxf2 with check.
358,12,80,4Kg1,b'8/1Q6/p3p3/P4k1p/8/6PP/4qP2/6K1 b - -',So he protects the pawn.
359,12,81,4Ke5,b'8/1Q6/p3p3/P3k2p/8/6PP/4qP2/6K1 w - -',I move my king over.
360,12,82,4Qc7+,b'8/2Q5/p3p3/P3k2p/8/6PP/4qP2/6K1 b - -',He throws in a check.
361,12,83,4Kd5,b'8/2Q5/p3p3/P2k3p/8/6PP/4qP2/6K1 w - -',King moves again.
362,12,84,4Qd8+,b'3Q4/8/p3p3/P2k3p/8/6PP/4qP2/6K1 b - -',Another check.

367,12,89,4Kf6,b'8/8/pQ2pk2/P6p/5P2/6PP/4q3/6K1 w - -',King moves.
368,12,90,4Qd8+,b'3Q4/8/p3pk2/P6p/5P2/6PP/4q3/6K1 b - -',Queen check.
369,12,91,4Kf7,b'3Q4/5k2/p3p3/P6p/5P2/6PP/4q3/6K1 w - -',King moves again. Draw agreed. Many thanks for reading this. Please rate this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!
370,13,0,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I was puzzled by this however it did not alter my plans. 
371,13,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Standard opening.
372,13,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Blocking progress in the center.

374,13,4,Na6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/n4np1/3pN3/3P4/2N1PQ2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',I realized this went against opening protocol. What I was avoiding was an early exchange. I was also using this move as a launching board for the next move positioning my N better. 
375,13,5,Qd1,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3pN3/1n1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -',My opponent smelled out my plan. 
376,13,6,dxe4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/4N3/1n1Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',I claimed his center pawn. 
377,13,7,1a3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/4N3/1nBPp3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',If I had looked harder I would have seen the opporunity to claim a sizeable material advantage and leave my opponent scrambling.

381,13,11,Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/pb3pbp/4pnp1/2p1N3/RP1nP3/2NBB3/2P3PP/3QK2R w K -',I cannot recall what possessed me to move here. Very poor decision on my behalf.

383,13,13,Qb4,b'5rk1/5pbp/4pnp1/2P1N3/1q1nP3/2NBB3/2P3PP/3QK2R w K -',I cannot recall exactly why I thought this was the better move vice Nxe5. I believe I wanted to pin his N.
384,13,14,Qa7,b'5rk1/q4pbp/4pnp1/4N3/N2nP3/3BB3/2PQ2PP/4K2R w K -',I am pretty sure I was afraid of having my Q trapped in the middle of the board. 
385,13,15,2Bxc2,b'5rk1/q4pbp/4pnp1/4N3/NQ2P3/4B3/2B3PP/4K2R b K -',My opponent increased his material advantage. However the center of the board was now open. 
386,13,16,Rd8+,b'3r2k1/5pbp/4pnp1/4N3/NQ2P3/4q3/2B3PP/3K3R w - -',The computer likes Bh6 vice Rd8+. I was wanted to force my opponent into a mistake vice wait and be more reactive. 
387,13,17,2Nd3,b'3r2k1/5pbp/4pnp1/8/NQ2P3/3Nq3/2B3PP/3K3R b - -',This was the blocking move I thought was least likely to occur. 
388,13,18,2Nxe4,b'3r2k1/5pbp/4p1p1/8/NQ2n3/3Nq3/2B3PP/3K3R w - -',I opted to just move my N forward into a better attacking position. 
389,13,19,2Re1,b'3r2k1/5pbp/4p1p1/8/NQ2n3/3Nq3/2B3PP/3KR3 b - -',My opponents downfall. He took away his only escape. 
390,13,20,2Nf2#,b'3r2k1/5pbp/4p1p1/8/NQ6/3Nq3/2B2nPP/3KR3 w - -',Mate. 
391,14,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I broke from my original game plan and opted to counter my opponents first move. 
392,14,1,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',I did not want to play e4 and lose the e file. I opted for something slightly different from my recent matches.
393,14,2,Nbd2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I opted for Nd2 vice Nc3 to provide protection to my c pawn. 
394,14,3,Qa4+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/QbPP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I did not plan on moving the Q out early however I saw an opening for something different. I played the Q in case my opponent blocked with either his b or c pawn. I would have an easy capture of his B.
395,14,4,Ne5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3pN3/QbPP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I wanted to exert pressure on his N. An exchange would still leave me the opportunity of capturing his B on b4. 
396,14,5,Bd7,b'r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/3pN3/QbPP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',The stage is still set for an exchange. 
397,14,6,Qc2,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2b1pn2/3p4/2PP4/8/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I retreated my Q from her exposed position. I did not want to move her back to her starting postion. That would have been pointless. I opted for Qc3 due to the protection for the c pawn and the ability for her to control the b1-h7 diagonal. 
398,14,7,1e3,b'r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2b1pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',I wanted to open a lane for my LSB and did not want to break the K-side pawns. e4 would have been a very poor move due to the amount of pieces my opponent had aimed towards it. 
399,14,8,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/3b4/1B1Pn3/3BP3/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',The computer wanted me to capture the R here. The thought had crossed my mind and in retrospect I probably should have moved forward with it.

I have seen this before where swapping my moves leaves me with a bigger advantage. So far I have trouble fully seeing the situations that will follow suit. 
401,14,10,1Bxf8,b'r2q1Bk1/2p3pp/1p2p3/p2b1p2/3Pn3/3BP3/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',My opponent forced my B to move...so I captured his R. I don't know why he left me the open lane still. My previous delays on this capture presented him with opportunities to take the initiative. 
402,14,11,1f3,b'r4qk1/2p3pp/1p2p3/p2b1p2/3Pn3/3BPP2/PPQ3PP/R4RK1 b - -',At this point there was not much else I saw that would benefit me. I also wanted to unclog the middle if possible and force his N to out. 
403,14,12,fxe4,b'r4qk1/2p3pp/1p1np3/p2b4/3Pp3/3B1P2/PPQ3PP/R4RK1 w - -',My opponent played what I wanted him to. I would be left with the advantage in the center. 
404,14,13,2Rae1,b'r5k1/2p1q1pp/1p1np3/p2b4/3PP3/3B4/PPQ3PP/4RRK1 b - -',I played Rae1 here to provide a look at the Q if the e file opened up and create more tention on e4. Playing exf5 would have opened the line to h7 which I saw and had plans for later. 
405,14,14,Qg5,b'r5k1/6pp/1p1np3/p1pP2q1/3P4/3B4/PPQ3PP/4RRK1 w - -',I really do not know what this move accomplished. 
406,14,15,2Ref1,b'r5k1/6pp/1p1n4/p1pp2q1/3P4/3B4/PPQ2RPP/5RK1 b - -',My plan was in place at this point barring any blockades from my opponent. There was potential to stop my intentions but I would re-direct if they came up.
407,14,16,2c4,b'r5k1/6pp/1p1n4/p2p2q1/2pP4/3B4/PPQ2RPP/5RK1 w - -',I do not think my opponent realized what I was going to do.

He attacks d4 and has plenty of opportunity to become aggressive on the queenside. In fact this is exactly why from time to time theory has considered the Advance Variation to be inferior. But the crucial question is: how does Black's short-term initiative compare to White's long-term prospects? This is where theory has changed its mind again and again in the past (and is likely to keep on doing so in the future).

589,23,2,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Göring Gambit of the Scotch Game goes 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3. Its goal like the goal of many gambits is (at least in part) to gain a lead in development. Because White already has a lead in development thanks to each side's third move I overcame my aversion to giving away pawns in the opening with ideally an even greater lead in development as compensation.
590,23,3,Bb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/8/1bB1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',At some point here the Game Database comes into play. Here Black picks the most common move in this position.

Black's actual move is played more often than the knight to f6 but I'm not sure why. 
593,23,6,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnpp1/2nb3p/3N4/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',This is a move I really suspect of being attributable to the database. Even though 8...Bd6 is only in the database twice Black won both times. However I don't see how it can be good as it blocks the d-pawn.
594,23,7,Re1,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnpp1/2nb3p/3N4/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq -',I leave the database here (earlier games saw 9. Be3 and 9. e5). This move discourages 9...Nxd5.
595,23,8,Ne5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppnpp1/3b3p/3Nn3/2B1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq -',Black has a lot of potential exchanges on the table now and each exchange helps Black. I'm starting to get pretty nervous already.
596,23,9,Rg8,b'r1bqk1r1/ppppnpp1/3b3p/3N4/2B1PPQ1/8/PP4PP/R1B1R1K1 w q -',12...O-O 13. Nf6+ just seems terrible for Black so he avoids castling. But he is many moves from being able to castle queenside--four at the very least. This should give White time to build up even more of an attack.
597,23,10,1f5,b'r1bqk1r1/ppppnpp1/3b3p/3N1P2/2B1P1Q1/8/PP4PP/R1B1R1K1 b q -',Opening the dark-squared bishop's diagonal. Even though White has quite a bit of time now before Black can get his king to safety I'm still feeling bad about this. For one thing where are the open lines to Black's king?
598,23,11,d6,b'r1bqk1r1/ppp1npp1/3p3p/3NbP2/2B1PBQ1/8/PP4PP/R3R1K1 w q -',Obviously not 14...Bxb2 when 15. Bxc7 traps the Black queen ignominiously.

602,23,15,1Rf8,b'r1bqkr2/ppp1np2/5p1p/4pP1Q/2B1P3/8/PP4PP/R3R1K1 w q -',Black only has two options here and picks what must be the wrong one. I expected 17...Rg7 when I made the knight sacrifice and was planning 18. Qxh6 Rg8 (or Kf8) 19. Qxf6 here. I think White has some play there otherwise I'm not playing 16. Nf6+ at all but when Black played this move instead I began to feel a lot better.
603,23,16,Bd7,b'r2qkr2/pppbnp2/5p1p/4pP1Q/2B1P3/8/PP4PP/3RR1K1 w q -',Now Black demonstrates a stubborn unwillingness to give up the queen. While there is no way to do so and stay ahead in material it would have resulted in an endgame where Black has a rook and knight for it and might still be able to put some play together.
604,23,17,1Be6,b'r2qkr2/pppbnp2/4Bp1p/4pP1Q/4P3/8/PP4PP/3RR1K1 b q -',I like this move. I saw it after 17...Rf8.
605,23,18,1Qb8,b'rq2kr2/pppbnp2/4Bp1p/4pP1Q/4P3/8/PP4PP/3RR1K1 w q -',This is the really stubborn move to save the queen but it looks absolutely silly hiding over there on b8. If Black goes with 19...Bxe6 20. Rxd8+ Kxd8 21. fxe6 fxe6 22. Qxh6 it's that losing endgame again but it's not completely hopeless.
606,23,19,Kd8,b'rq1k1r2/pppBnp2/5p1p/4pP1Q/4P3/8/PP4PP/3RR1K1 w - -',A stalemated king is never good; even worse when the queen is trapped with nothing to do; and even worse when one rook is stalemated and the other staring at doubled pawns on its file.
607,23,20,2Qxf6,b'rq1k2r1/pppBnp2/5Q2/4pP2/4P3/8/PP4PP/3RR1K1 b - -',Black resigns. He could still play on with 22...c5 which loses a piece but is the only move that doesn't lead to instant annihilation. One variation (hardly forced) that I would very much have enjoyed playing through to the end was 22... c6 23. Be6+ Kc7 24. Qxe7+ Kb6 25. Qb4+ Ka6 26. Re3 b5 27. Ra3+ Kb6 28. Qa5+ Kb7 29. Rd7+ Kc8 30. Rxf7# - but the position of Black's king and queen in the actual final position is amusing enough.
608,24,0,Bc5,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Pe4 was undefended.

610,24,2,Bxd4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2BbP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',Just like that.
611,24,3,Rxf7,b'r1bq2k1/pppp1rpp/2n2n2/4p1N1/3bP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',While I would have moved the king a bishop and knight ARE worth a pawn and rook.  This was not a bad move.
612,24,4,Be3,b'r1bq4/pppp1kpp/2n2n2/4p3/3bP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',Oops.  Black picks up a pawn and rook for a bishop with this blunder.
613,24,5,d6,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/4B3/PbPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Ok what?  BxR!  BxR!  The rook is worth five (5) points the bishop a mere three.  The reason is that the rook can cover the entire board while black's black bishop is blind to the white squares.  In that respect a bishop is worth about half a rook.  We give it 3/5ths the value.
614,24,6,1c4,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/4B3/Pb1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - c3',?  Black WANTS the white rook.  So bad he can taste white rook sizzling on the campfire spit.
615,24,7,1Bxa1,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/4B3/P2N1PPP/b2Q1RK1 w - -',Ah finally!
616,24,8,Ng4,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/2np4/4p3/2P1P1n1/4B3/P2N1PPP/Q4RK1 w - -',This is the first move I saw too.  On closer examination the white bishop is trapped.  While a knight/bishop exchange usually confers no advantage black is four points ahead.  EVERY trade improves white's ultimate power.  And this one doubles up white's pawns even though the black king ends up in discovered check unless white responds with Qe1 or (probably better) Qc3.
617,24,9,1f3,b'r1bq4/ppp2kpp/2np4/4p3/2P1P1n1/4BP2/P2N2PP/Q4RK1 b - -',That move forces black to defile the now unprotected bishop.
618,24,10,Qg5,b'r1b5/ppp2kpp/2np4/4p1q1/2P1P3/4nP2/P2N2PP/Q1R3K1 w - -',Black aims for a 15 move game.  White must defend against QxPg2#.  Pg3 is about all there is.
619,24,11,1Kf2,b'r1b5/ppp2kpp/2np4/4p1q1/2P1P3/4nP2/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 b - -',Or that which is MUCH better yet.  Good move for black!
620,24,12,1Bd7,b'r7/pppb1kpp/2np4/4p1q1/2P1P3/4nP2/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 w - -',I think I like Be6 better.  Puts pressure on Pc4.  NxPg2 is another.
621,24,13,1f4,b'r7/pppb1kpp/2n5/2p1p1q1/4PP2/4n3/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 b - -',?  This does nothing for white.  I prefer RxPc5.
622,24,14,1Qxf4+,b'r7/pppb1kpp/2n5/2p1p3/4Pq2/4n3/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 w - -',Right.
623,24,15,1Ke2,b'r7/pppb1kpp/2n5/2p1p3/4Pq2/4n3/P2NK1PP/Q1R5 b - -',Or white could interpose the knight.  This is probably better.
624,24,16,Bb5+,b'r7/ppp2kpp/8/1bp1p3/3nPq2/3Kn3/P2N2PP/Q1R5 w - -',Looks like white should interpose the knight (protected by king and rook).  Kc3 allows Ne2+ letting black's knight fork white's rook.
625,24,17,Bc6,b'r7/ppp2kpp/2b5/2p1p3/3nPq2/2K1n3/P2N2PP/Q1R5 w - -',?  Ne2+ forks the rook.  Oh I am SO disappointed.  Black wants Pe4?  Seems like a waste of time with so much power in the field.
626,24,18,2Nc4,b'r7/ppp2kpp/2b5/2p1p3/2NnPq2/2K1n3/P5PP/Q1R5 b - -',Ne4+ still looks good.  I could see a case for QxPe4 though.  But take the rook.  It WANTS to be taken.
627,24,19,2Ne2+,b'r7/ppp2kpp/2b5/2p1p3/2N1Pq2/2K1n3/P3n1PP/Q1R5 w - -',:)
628,24,20,2Nxe3,b'r7/ppp2kpp/2b5/2p1p3/4Pq2/4N3/P2K2PP/Q1n5 b - -',Smart move for black.  Nc1 looks beyond rescue though Qf2+ KxN QxN makes an exchange.
629,24,21,2Kxc1,b'3r4/ppp2kpp/2b5/2p1p3/4Pq2/4N3/P5PP/Q1K5 b - -',Another way to trade--even better because it puts the rook in play.

He resigned this and in return I resigned a game where I was 2 pawns down without any compensation. I was a bit surprised at his resignation comment. ""I think I could draw this with good play...but as you insist I'll resign"". I tend to disagree I think this position is pretty hopeless for black. He has only one pawn for the knight. He is losing one of his kingside pawns for my e pawn. My king easily blocks his passed f pawn. My knight can quickly and easily jump from the queenside to the kingside as necessary. But I'd be interested in your view near reader! So please leave a comment or two and please rate it on the star system."

I end up being a pawn up from Move 5 onwards and carry this advantage right through to the conclusion of the game.  So how was it that I am still jstevens1 and not TheBlackQueen?  Well unfortunately my rook was on the wrong side of my passer in a rook ending.  So how did all this happen?

I remember a game called Turnaround many years ago when my opponent was a pawn up in similar circumstances and pushed it right up to the 7th rank.  However it turned out to be a mistake because then Paul who was my opponent neglected his kingside pawns so that his king could try and help his rook in an effort to crown that pawn.  Meanwhile those neglected p(r)awns were far too yummy for my seafood-loving Henry to resist!  I will not therefore make Paul's mistake.  Indeed over the next few moves Henry kept right close to his pawns and I made no attempt to advance my passer.  A few moves later Gudrun and I agreed a draw.  Although it is another frustrating effort for Yours Truly at least I held on to a material plus late on in the game and got myself out of a potentially fatal bind so there is another baby step in the right direction to becoming TheBlackQueen.

After all  piece activity plays a big role in any strong position. But since Black's kingside pawn structure is already slightly weakened by the fianchettoed Bishop this move is alright since it weakens it even more and removes two main defenders.  From now on I must make sure all my minor pieces are active to make up for my lost rook and slightly exposed king.

Also this is a way more active spot for the bishop than d7 and allows the rook to come later to c8 or f8 if need be.
970,36,24,1Be3,b'r7/pp2pkbp/2npbnp1/2q5/4P3/P1N1B2P/1PP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Developing with tempo and kicking the Black queen from the queenside (Qc4 is viable but quite useless in my opinion).

After 20.......Rxf6 21.exf Qxf6 22.Re5 I didn't think white had anything really special so I went for the R sac. I should have analysed the line furter as white has quite a good game
