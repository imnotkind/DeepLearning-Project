The reason that I stopped playing the Ruy Lopez is that after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5, 3...a6 forces white to exchange B for N.  And, I'm not into exchanging so early because of what kenneth_fiore_3 told me before and during our first training session. "

I say that because on two occasions, I played 4.Ng5?!  The only reason for that is because Coach Stockel did a lecture on various openings.  He said that this is most analyzed by GM's nowadays because after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, the only way to prevent a N fork with with 3...Be6  If black bring the N out, 4.Ng5 automatically leads to a fork and wins a R and P since 5.Nxf7 can't be stopped.  But, I think that the glaucoma got him, as I hate to say it, but almost, as often as, I do, he makes mistakes in his analysis.  And, after 4.Ng5, black can stop the threat with 4...d5, so it does become a cheapo tactic, as well.  As now, white only has two pieces out, and what more is that he or she is forced to exchange B for N, anyway.  And, when that happens, black gets a small space advantage because he's not far from castling and can develop, whereas, white has even more work to do to get pieces out and develop.  This happened to me in the first tournament game with Tom Walsh, when I first tried it and didn't end well.  In fact, not exchanging led to a double check and then a mate in 2 or 3, with which, I resigned.  So, I generally will now castle after 3.Bc4, but because Carl played this and only advanced one pawn, I treat it like a Philidor's Defense and go right into the exchange variation starting with my next move.  What also came into consideration was 4.Bb5 to pin his Nc6, but it's not a good enough reason since Carl could, and likely, would break it with 4...Bd7 "
36,2,5,Be6,b'r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2npb3/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"? Carl played this to prevent me from doubling his pawns on b6 starting with 6.Nxc6.  But, this is a mistake, as first, I'll exchange his B first.  And, it's not because of Jack telling me that a B is worth 3.5 points since, as Charles posted, it's about whether the position is open or not.  The real reason for me exchanging was to remove his f pawn as that's the critical square.  And, this will leave his K to vulnerable to exposure.  But, it gets even better, as I almost miss this opportunity.  Once he recaptures, I can and will win a pawn by recapturing with the B, (7.Bxe6)."

As it turns out, I played the right move but for the wrong reason which is why I'm not giving it an !, like I normally would.  Very similar to what we saw in a variation of Eric's annotation, which Simon corrected, I was also having Ghost Vision here.  For some reason, I thought that my Rf1 was on e1 which was not, and so this appeared to lose a pawn.  Ghost Vision is a little more common for me in a tournament since it's timed.  But, it hasn't happened in a while since the game would end way too quickly.  In fact, Jack said that we all need to slow down and be almost at our last minutes during the tournament.  Many don't agree with that, but I did because only using, for example, 15 or 20 minutes since we ended with 30 or 35 caused me to make mistakes and blunders that shouldn't have been made.  In fact, that's another reason for me annotating these games.  Notating this tournament game where I'm now down to about 25 minutes caused me to have that Ghost vision since I'm going back and forth with the notes and pushing the clock to tell Carl that it's his move.  However, it's worth the efforts for the reason that I noted in the intro of this annotation.  And, as it turns out, this is the right move because of what happens when Carl captures."

In this case, he was right not to do it.  But, I would've let the R go because a Q is, generally more valuable.  Yet, he's still losing the equivalent to a R, since after I take he will take back.  I actually think that this outcome is better for black because both R's against the Q is a general draw.  However, I'm up almost the equivalent to a R, but he has the chance to do a lot of damage with both R's which will happen towards the end.  Also, this gives him the equivalent to a pawn so it's +4 for me, but if he had given up an entire R to avoid giving up the Q, it would be a +5 for me which is more.  I'm sure that Carl took note of that."

As now, the only way to protect it is by giving up his c6 pawn.  However, my time is just beginning to run low.  Whereas, Carl has only used 10 minutes which is consistent with the mistakes, I only have, about, 20 minutes left on the clock.  Yet, I think that playing 21.Qf6 would've allowed me just enough time to secure a win, as opposed to, timing out.  The reason being is that after 22.Qxc6, white now threatens to mate with 23.Qa8#  22...Kd8 would stop the threat, but after 23.Qa8+ Ke7 or 23...Ke8 24.Re1+ black, I believe, would run into other problems.  By playing this, Carl can and will defend the pawn with his next move.  Although the move is not terrible, per say, and just not the best, I marked this with 2 queries because this is what will likely cost me the game.  That's because, even if I don't make a terrible mistake, there's now a good chance that I will lose by default, and if I had played 22.Qe6! that wouldn't have happened."

But, the main symptom of having special needs is needing extra time, which is what I used to get on exams when in School and College.  So, more then most, and we're talking about time and a half or double.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist for me here.

In fact, it was won, and I almost had a mating sequence and didn't go wrong.  But, I lost the game on time (timedout).  I use a quartz clock, so it's based on when that small hand that clicks flips passed red flag.  Then, it goes down which signals that you have timed out, and it's lost.  That happened to me on 2 or 3 occasions and didn't want it to reoccur.  So, I'm trying to find the winning continuation.  And, although it's not right here, this is where I start to go wrong."

But, here's the thing, even I find the right move to avoid mate, I'll probably wind up losing the game on time because finding the win is a little bit harder then it was in the other games where I timed out.  And, I don't have more time then I did in the other games.  Right now, I'm down to, about 16 minutes, whereas, Carl has slightly less then 40.

Opening up a window for my K, as GM Susan Polgar puts it, or giving the K air to breathe, as Jack says, was essential.  Having said that, if I had a little more time, at least 25 minutes, I would've played 25.g3, and I would be able to force a win.  With 25 minutes, I would have just been enough time.  But, I had about 15 minutes left since I resign, and it only takes me a minute or less before that happened.

But, the reality is that it was a won position, but I probably would've lost on time.  And, where that happened was with 21.Qg4, and while in it of itself, the move isn't worth two quieries, I gave it that since playing 21.Qe6, right away, more then likely, would've allowed me to find the winning continuation on time.  To be exact, against my 14, Carl had 35 minutes on the clock which means that the game only took him 15 minutes.  And, that was consistent with his first mistake, followed by, the blunder on his 15th which should've costed him the game.  By making that small miscalculation, I had to go a little quicker in an attempt to find the win which is where I overlooked the back rank threat and lost."

I usually retreat because I, generally, don't see a good reason for exchanging early.  But, this is an exception.  I did this and for more then just tripling Carl's pawns around the K side.  The main reason is that, in the process, his f pawn is now gone.  This is significant because of the fact that the f pawn is the weakest pawn on the chess board.  As a matter of fact, in the Domiano's Defense, 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6? white's best move 3.Nxe5! because of what happens when black takes back.  Ok, so that's obvious, but similar to a student, back in the day, I answered with 3.Nc3.  It's not obvious how I remembered that capturing on e5 is obvious.  But, the real way that I remembered, once and for all, was TA's blitz Q sacs.  So, let's say Joe was white, he started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5? (which is ill advised for anyonelse) 2...Nf6 (but even if black played 2...Nc6), Joe's next move is the same, contrary to how most would respond, 3.Qxf7+ which is where he sacs the Q for pawn.  And, the reason for him winning is significant.  It's not like most blitz, but he mentioned that way early when there's plenty of time, his opponents go wrong very soon afterwards by not paying attention to the fact that they're K is weakened without the f pawn.  So, they do things like stop developing because they feel they've won and lose.  It doesn't seem relevant to this game, but keeping all of these perspectives in mind, I more or less, convert the equation by exchanging to remove Carl's critical pawn from the chess board.  As now, he needs to be weary about his monarch for the rest of the game.  Thus, it's no longer safe for carl to castle short. "

The real reason is because he's a pawn down and doesn't want to liquidate.  But, I believe that another reason is that he was focused on my K and had plans to attack it with his B+N+R.  Whether he likes it or not, I decide to put a stop to that, by liquidating, anyhow.  Doing that is also going to win a piece, in addition to, what I already have which is now clearly winning for white."

I did something like this with Eric when mentioning about Rfe1, I believe it was.  He rightly pointed out that the R's didn't see each, so there was only R which made it Re1.  Well, the opposite is true here since either one could move.  So, I figured out based on how I think.  And, I determined that it was this R because it allows me to centralize the other R, bring it to the center, at a later time.  If I had used the other R, I wouldn't have been able to centralize either one. "

I also thought that if worse came to worse, we'd exchange on f3, which would allow me to stop his pawn on f4 with one of my R's.  But, this is a terrible blunder which should lose a winning game.  As Carl won't exchange, but instead, he'll advance.  And, doing that will leave him unstoppable passed pawn.  I have seen something like this a couple of times prior, but was unprepared for this moment.  So, knowing that I am lost here, if black finds the best move, rather then resign, there's small hope of getting a draw which is about to happen.

So, this was still his best move, but I've got more fight left then it appears.  And, I knew that, so then, it's about what to do.  And, believe it or not, this is where I start thinking about what's going to happen in the end.

It's an intermezzo which means that white is winning, and yet, it's drawn, as I learned that term from ION.  Before, the position hadn't exactly repeated 3 times since he went Kc7 and then, Ka7.  But, right when this was played ...Kb7 was reached, as well as, my moves, 3 times in a row.  So, I knew that the same position occurred that many times and a draw was forced.  I used the exact same strategy as one of Jack's young students, Cavayah against me.  I had a won position and was a piece up and threatened to do damage, but I overlooked something which allowed her to get a draw by repetition.  I thought that the position repeated twice, but Cavayah was right.  I miscalculated one move which made it 3 times, when she declared it.  Believe it or not, Cavayah is exactly the same age that I was when I first got back into playing chess, after having had given it up for a while.  At 16, I was going to learn once and for all, as a result of failing English.   And, Cavayah is a pretty strong player who sometimes beats Carl and Tom Walsh.  Jack Stockel, as we know is such a good mentor that not only do I enjoy teaching chess, but 2 of his younger students have their parents drive them 30 minutes from where they live to the chess club for more lessons with the, legendary, mentor.  Cavayah is the main one, as it happened with a 12 year old student, once.  Not seeing how it's a draw, Carl got out of check, but I played the same moves on him, anyway.  Jack analyzed it and agreed that there was no way out of this for black.  Jack congratulated me and said that I played very well for someone that was winning.  I'd like to agree but know that I made a mistake by letting one of his passed pawns become a monster.  And, if Carl had played 37...Rxc7, instead, he would've promoted, and I'd be lost.  "

7.	Nf3	In his excellent book, ""The Road to Chess Mastery"" (1966) the former World Champion described this move as 7. Nf3(?) ""White attempts to defend the knight a third time. But at any time Black can nullify this defence by pinning the knight with ....Bg4. Therefore 7. Nf3 is not adequate. White should have played 7. Bc4 followed by 8. Ne2."" That was an accurate assessment of chess theory at the time. However in the 1980s an alternative method of development was found, making 7. Nf3 playable after all.
