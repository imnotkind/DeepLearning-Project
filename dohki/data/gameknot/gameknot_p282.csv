16,0,16,1Rae1,b'r1bq1rk1/p3bp2/2p1pn1Q/1p2P2n/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',I like this move..I've been reading this book called 'Excelling at Chess calculation' by Jacob Aagaard a great book by the way where he speaks of finding 'candidate moves'. Ofcourse taking the knight wins back material but I decided to look a bit further and found this move! It doesn't threaten anything for now but black should really feel the pressure on the kingside building up.

104,5,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',4...Be7; 5. 0-0 d5; 6. Nc3 0-0 7. d3 d4!; 8. Nb5 Nc6 gives Black the initiative and is a more accurate move order than the game continuation.  Therefore White is advised to enter the main lines after 7. d4.
105,5,2,Bd6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',The bishop will become a target on this square and it will be easier for White to open the position for his better coordinated and developed forces.

109,5,6,cxd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2pbpn2/3P1p2/4P3/2NP1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',Now some forced play will clarify the situation in White's favor.
110,5,7,1Qb3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n2pp/3b4/3p1p2/8/1Q1P1NP1/PP3PBP/R1B2RK1 b - -',White immediately takes advantage of the light-squared weakness.  Now 12...Nf6 can be met with either 13. Re1 or Bg5 with an advantage for White.

Note that my dark bishop is totally hemmed in on this side so I'll have to fianchetto it.  Still this is so far pretty standard play on both sides.  Another response might be 2...Nc6.  Note that 2...Nf6 attacking the pawn would be bad as 3. e5 has a defended pawn and my knight would have to run around.  2...d6 is necessary for ...Nf6.

This brings up one of the common debates in chess.  Which is better the bishop or the knight?  The Ruy Lopez basically prefers the knight in the opening but it's far from settled.  Still from this move white seems to be more comfortable playing down a bishop.

It can't really go anywhere from there and this move wasn't necessary to develop other pieces.  Might have made more sense to do 7. b3 setting up the fianchetto.

Still my bishops are going right through the centre so it would be a shame not to get rid of those white pawns innit?  White could also move his/her DSB to c3 after this protecting that pawn on e5 and offering up a queen trade.  Since white is ahead in material this would be a good play.  A general principle of chess is to trade pieces when you're ahead.

Qxd1  21.Rxd1 Rxd1 .  Of course I don't actually expect white's DSB to move but I'm applying pressure down the centre now.  Also whites f file rook can't offer much protection to the queen atm since my LSB is attacking his available squares.
213,10,35,2Rf6,b'3r1rk1/3q1p1p/p1p2Rp1/2p1b1N1/1Pb1N3/P6P/3B2P1/1R1Q2K1 b - -',Not sure why this move.  The rook isn't going anywhere that I can see from here.  Seems to be tempting me to take it with the DSB which would lead to a devastating Queen-King check from the e4 knight.  Nice try but I am NOT moving that bishop.  This however means my queen and king are on dangerous ground.

My DSB is suddenly in a dangerous position for him.  Seems white was thinking 23. Ne4 to fork the rooks but that would lead to 23. Ne4 fxe4 24. Nxe4 Qxf2   25.Kh1 Rxd2 which would be a huge advantage for me.
218,10,40,2Bxb1,b'3r1rk1/5p1p/p1p3p1/2N1b1N1/1P1q4/P6P/3B1RP1/1b1Q2K1 w - -',So what the hell take the rook attempt to even out the material disadvantage.  Suddenly one of the king's defenders is missing.

I think that's it.  That rook is dead.  I'm not fearing the attempted fork at Ne6 because I'm taking that rook on the next play.

But I have to get rid of one of those defenders.  I can't just take that DSB with my rook though since the knight is defending it.  Also I'm currently in danger of a fork at Ne4.

Leaving it and getting on with normal development seems more logical. A pawn retake if I capture the knight is going to produce a doubled pawn and if I meant to withdraw the bishop I wouldn't have made that move. More on this..

363,17,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Here's the description from my mini-tournament which starts with the moves 1. e4 c5 2. d4!?

Ken Smith played this opening a lot... 1. e4 c5 2. d4!? which has a lot of interesting variations that aren't normally seen here on gameknot or anywhere for that matter. One time Bent Larsen was annotating a game where Smith's opponent played the French Defense and the annotations went: 1. e4 e6? (Better is 1... c5! which wins a pawn)"
364,17,1,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The first move actually made in the game -- an obvious and natural one too.  This is a regular sicilian thus far with just a different move order.
365,17,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',White has the option of recapturing right away (3. Qxd4) developing with 3. Nf3 and daring white to try to hold onto the pawn with 3. ...e5 (as in this game) or going into the Smith-Morra gambit proper (3. c3) which looks a lot like the danish gambit (for those familiar with 1. e4 e5 2. d4!? exd4 3. c3).
366,17,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black decides against e5 and gives me the option to turn this into a standard sicilian game with 4. Nxd4.
367,17,4,c3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',...but how boring would that be?  4. c3!? isn't the soundest gambit to be sure since it appears white is offering a pawn for just one tempo but if I can develop quickly and efficiently maybe I can turn this into an effective attack.  (That's the goal anyway!)
368,17,5,dxc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I approve of this move since allowing 5. cxd4 allows white to hit back in the center and regain his pawn -- this is black's best shot for an edge.
369,17,6,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',!?  Very speculative -- offering a second pawn for one more tempo.  If black bites and plays cxb2 the white bishops will be extremely powerful but will they be worth two pawns?
370,17,7,e6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black isn't biting and in fact looks to be trying to reduce the influence of white's Bc4 with this move which gives him a paulsen-like setup.
371,17,8,O-O,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Castling seems like a normal developing move here.  Now I'm still willing to allow cxb2 because my bishop will become very powerful on that long diagonal especially if black plays Bc5 or the like which e6 seemed to prepare.
372,17,9,a6,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',I didn't understand this move initially until I realized that black was preparing to play b5 driving my bishop off of c4.  Well if he's going to be pushing pawns...
373,17,10,Nxc3,b'r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Then I'm going to keep developing pieces!  My goal is to use my edge in development and slight space advantage to launch an attack down the open c- and half-open d-files.
374,17,11,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2b5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Of course this is going to require a balance of defending as well as black is not without his own resources.
375,17,12,a3,b'r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2b5/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Black may not like the looks of my bishop on c4 and I don't like the looks of his on c5.  This move prepares to knock the Bc5 into the corner.
376,17,13,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1npp3/2b5/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',?!  Now this move is perfectly fine and even makes it into the gameknot game DB (with a win for white) but it is not a good move here.  Why?  First it prevents the bishop from retreating to e7.  Second the new moves it allows Bd7 and Qd7 are not moves black is going to make!  Nge7 was my preferred move here as if I were black I'd want to neutralize white's developmental edge as soon as possible!

380,17,17,1Nge7,b'r1bqk2r/bp2nppp/p1npp3/6B1/1PB1P3/P1N2N2/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',This is probably the best and safest move as Nf6 would leave black exposed to a dangerous future e5 thrust and f6 weakens the light squares around black's king.

Black is nearly caught up in development and I can see that after b5 and Bb7 he'll have his development nearly completed and all I'll have to show for my pawn is a space advantage.  At this point I realized I was going to have to turn up the pressure if I wanted to get a (hopefully winning) attack going!
383,17,20,1Qe2,b'r1bq1rk1/bp2nppp/p1npp3/6B1/1PB1P3/P1N2N2/4QPPP/2R2RK1 b - -',Preparing to give the black queen some uncomfortable opposition with Rfd1!

Get an Rd3 Rd2 and Qd1 and just ram it down black's throat!  Is this a good sound plan?  I'm not sure even now.  But I'm better developed and more maneuverable and it's better to have a speculative plan than no plan at all!

Still had I known I could've achieved this configuration a move earlier.  It's silly to harp on it now but the reason I'm critical of it is that when you're ahead in development you want to make every move count!  If black catches up in development then I've got nothing to show for the pawn.  At least I have more space.
392,17,29,1Rd8,b'rq1r3k/bb2nppp/p1npp3/1p4B1/1P2P3/PBNR1N2/4QPPP/3R2K1 w - -',...I see he's not going to give me the pawn back so freely and easily.

394,17,31,1Ng6,b'rq1r3k/bb3ppp/p1npp1n1/1p4B1/1P2P3/PBNR1N2/3RQPPP/6K1 w - -',"I guess not.  So when I first saw this move I said ""ooh free rook!""  And then I said no no look if you play 18. Bxd8 he plays Nf4 and then what?  Well it looks like the complications favor white after 18. Bxd8 Nf4 19. Qd1 Nxd3 20. Rxd3 but I thought I could get a better position by reducing the effectiveness of a possible Nf4."
395,17,32,1Qd1,b'rq1r3k/bb3ppp/p1npp1n1/1p4B1/1P2P3/PBNR1N2/3R1PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',And in hindsight maybe Bxd8 was indeed better.  But this isn't terrible either.

397,17,34,1Be3,b'rq1r3k/bb4pp/p1npppn1/1p6/1P2P3/PBNRBN2/3R1PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',This is the best square I could find although Bh5 may not have been awful either.  Still exchanging the dark-squared bishops aren't so important when I'm going to be able to get away with Rxd6 shortly.
398,17,35,1Bxe3,b'rq1r3k/1b4pp/p1npppn1/1p6/1P2P3/PBNRbN2/3R1PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',Of course.

So now the lines are drawn; I'm going to try to blow open the center and win material while black's going to defend and try to make it to a won endgame."

418,17,55,2Nxe6,b'r6k/6pp/pqbQnp2/1p6/1P2P3/P1N1PN1P/6P1/6K1 w - -',Black chooses the safest route which is to simplify by exchanging pieces towards a won endgame.

A little bit on why; black gets a lot of tactical activity.  Yes his exposed queen is a target but he threatens to win material with tricks like Bb4 followed by Bxc3 if white moves the Nf3 then dxc4 discovers an attack on the Bg5 and black will have plenty of play on the queenside.

White has many options as well and my opponent eschews the main line (7. Nfd2 Bb4 8. Qc2) for reasons all his own."

I know I moved Bb4 then Bd6 and then Bb4 again but considering the space and control I have it's not a big deal.  The next moves come easily for black as his control of space allows him to attack at will.
549,22,29,1Rd4,b'6k1/pp3ppp/2r2n2/q3p3/1bBrP3/2N2P2/PP2QP1P/R1R3K1 w - -',Threatening to win the bishop.  When the bishop moves the Nc3 comes under fire.  I thought relatively best for white was the somewhat aggressive Bd5.

551,22,31,Rxc3,b'6k1/pp3ppp/5n2/q3p3/3rP3/1Br2P2/P3QP1P/R1R3K1 w - -',And white has threats no doubt and black must be careful (look how weak his back rank is) but at this point I think I'm winning.
552,22,32,2Qe1,b'6k1/pp3ppp/5n2/q3p3/3rP3/1Br2P2/P4P1P/R1R1Q1K1 b - -',Looks like it pins the Rc3 but I've got nothing to be afraid of.  He can't threaten to win anything as Rxc1 prevents Qxa5.
553,22,33,2Rdd3,b'6k1/pp3ppp/5n2/q3p3/4P3/1Brr1P2/P4P1P/R1R1Q1K1 w - -',Loading up on the 3rd rank.  I know all the books tell you to do it on the 2nd but this just works better here.  Black threatens Rxf3 now further exposing white's king and granting his rooks even greater scope.
554,22,34,2Rcd1,b'6k1/pp3ppp/5n2/q3p3/4P3/1Brr1P2/P4P1P/R2RQ1K1 b - -',I don't know how this white rook can maneuver more but it isn't effective.  The d8 square is covered by the queen!
555,22,35,2Rdxf3,b'6k1/pp3ppp/5n2/q3p3/4P3/1Br2r2/P4P1P/R2RQ1K1 w - -',So I'm happy to play Rxf3.

So the moral is understand what the position is telling you don't waste moves and always HAVE A PLAN.  Umm... those are obvious morals.  Never mind.  Hope it was fun!"
562,23,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I've gotta confess I was not feeling too good about seeing this.  I haven't faced 1. Nf3 before and so I figured my best option was to just do some safe kingside developing for awhile and wait for white to make a commitment.
563,23,1,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',no commitment yet so I'm content to think about Nf6 g6 Bg7 and 0-0 and go from there.
564,23,2,Bg2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Still no reason to think otherwise...
565,23,3,d3,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - -',At this point I said to myself that if he's not going to make a bid for the center then *I will*.

I thought white would play Kh3 and have to contend with N5xh4 threatening the queen and a possible mate in the corner.
615,23,53,3gxf5,b'8/p1r3kp/5pp1/4pP2/4q2P/1Pp2nK1/6Q1/R1R2B2 b - -',?  But this allows black to win easily.

And in combination with long castling it doesn´t look sound. The Queen will come under fire giving Black some valuable tempi as we shall see.

856,33,24,1Qxf3,b'r4rk1/1pp3pp/pb1pp3/4p3/P3P3/2NP1q1P/1PP2P2/R2QKR2 w Q -',Gaining a point offering an exchange of queens but Qf6-h4 looks better because more leverage can be had with the queen on the board. It is true that after Qd1xf3 Rf8xf3 both the f2 and h3 pawns are attacked and both can not be saved so the same +1 is gained but again no queens after.
857,33,25,Bxf2,b'r5k1/1pp3pp/p2pp3/4p3/P3P3/2NP1r1P/1PP2b2/2KR1R2 w - -',This move immediately gains a pawn but has the disadvantage of enabling a pin on the bishop. Of course Ra8-f8 will remedy the situation but then Rd1-d2 will prevent Rf3xh3.
858,33,26,1Nd1,b'5rk1/1pp3pp/p2pp3/4p3/P3P3/3P1r1P/1PPR1b2/2KN1R2 b - -',Now the bishop must move and there is no advantage over 17.Rxh3.
859,33,27,1Be3,b'5rk1/1pp3pp/p2pp3/4p3/P3P3/3Pbr1P/1PPR4/2KN1R2 w - -',This move results in equal trades resulting in black maintaining the 2 point lead. With accurate play black should win.
860,33,28,2Kxd1,b'6k1/1pp3pp/p2pp3/4p3/P3P3/3P3P/1PP5/3K4 b - -',Both kings will have to race towards the kingside of the board. White to protect the h3 pawn and black to try and press the advantage using the pawn majority. A plan for black would be to distract the king using operations on the queenside then sieze the advantage on the queenside.
861,33,29,3Kg3,b'8/2p1k3/pp2p3/4p2p/PPP1P1pP/6K1/8/8 b - -',This move is bad because it is obvious that both kings can not pass on the f file so the action will take place queenside where both kings should be.
862,33,30,Kc5,b'8/2p5/4p3/p1k1p2p/P1P1P1pP/4K3/8/8 w - -',Good move traditional !  White can not both protect the c pawn and block the g pawn.
863,33,31,3Kd3,b'8/2p5/4p3/p1k1p2p/P1P1P1pP/3K4/8/8 b - -',White can only stop the g pawn at the expense of the c pawn.
864,33,32,Kd3,b'8/2p5/4p3/p3p2p/P3P2P/3k1Kp1/8/8 w - -',Black has the advantage on this move by blockading the white king and enabling a free path for the c pawn.
865,33,33,Kd2,b'8/8/4p3/p3p2p/P1p1P2P/8/3k1K2/8 w - -',Keeping the opposition. Note how the black king controls c1 c2 c3 which gives the pawn complete safety on these squares. The white king can not pass and can not achieve a passed pawn in time.
866,33,34,c2,b'8/8/4p3/p3p2p/P3P2P/8/2pk1K2/8 w - -',Resignation to the inevidable. Good game! Looks like someone was reading that Silman endgame book! Nice endgame play!
867,34,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the Queen's Indian Defense d5-pawn sac line.  A nice positional crush up to the sacrificial finish.  Feel free to leave comments especially if you're going to give it 1 star!!!
868,34,1,d4,b'rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',6. Nc3 0-0; 7. Re1! is more topical and now 7...Ne4 7...c5 or 7...d5 are possible.

870,34,3,d5,b'rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/2pP4/2P5/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This temporary pawn sacrifice can also occur when Black plays 6...0-0; 7. d5 ed; 8. Nh4 c6!? with roughly equal chances.  With the c-pawn on c5 the White pawn center will permanently cramp the Black position.
871,34,4,Nh4,b'rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p3n2/2pp4/2P4N/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',A typical theme in the QID white exploits the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal to win back the pawn.  The h4-knight also prepares to sink in on f5 with threats against the Black king.

877,34,10,1Bf4,b'r2q1rk1/pb2bpp1/1p1p1n1p/2pPnN2/5B2/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Then again h6 does become the scene of a later sacrifice!

890,34,23,2a3,b'3qrbk1/1b3pp1/r2p1nnp/2pP1N2/ppN1PP2/P5P1/1PQB2BP/2R1R1K1 b - -',Now that the rook wont be able to come to the b-file quickly due to my control over b6 I dont mind opening the b-file as my heavy pieces will be able to occupy it much quicker.

1005,39,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Pretty much standard for me and many other gameknot players although many people prefer the sicilian defense (1. ... c5) the french defense (1. ... e6 followed by 2. ... d5) the caro-kann (1. ... c6 followed by 2. ... d5) or the pirc defense (1. ... d6 followed by g6 Nf6 and Bg7).  All of these variants are sound and choosing one is merely a matter of taste.
1006,39,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The best move in my opinion as it develops a piece and threatens black's pawn on e5.

The alternative is for black to play Nf6 which usually leads to white playing 4. Ng5!? which is the speculative fried liver attack.
1010,39,6,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',More common is either 4. b4 (the evans gambit) or 4. c3 (preparing d4 guioco piano which means quiet game although it's often anything but) -- either way castling is okay just not as aggressive as either of those.
1011,39,7,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Opening the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop to develop.  I didn't want to commit to Nf6 yet as threatening the pin Bg4 may be more important right now.
1012,39,8,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',?  This opens lines for white but does this really favor him?  Sure his Bc1 is now free and his Bc4 isn't trapped outsite the pawn chain as it would be after 5. d3 but this just gives black the d-pawn for free.
1013,39,9,Nxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',My preferred recapture as I'd rather have undoubled pawns and a bishop instead of a knight here.

1016,39,12,Bb5+,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/1B2p3/3bP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',?  While a check is nice here this is white's only developed piece -- why move it twice in the opening?  Furthermore after black's most logical response (7. ... c6 which also supports an eventual d5 push) white must move the bishop a *third* time in the opening.
1017,39,13,c6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/1B2p3/3bP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Forcing the bishop to move again.

1019,39,15,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3bP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now that Bg4 is ineffective (there's no knight on f3 to pin) and f5 is a bad move (with the pawn on e4 in a battery with the Bd3) Nf6 is logical simple development.
1020,39,16,Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3bP3/3B4/PPPQ1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',"I had kind of hoped for Bg5 (allowing Bxb2) so I had to think about this move for white.  It ""develops"" the queen but this is to a bad square since it blocks the bishop in and the queen doesn't do much more on d2 than it was doing on d1.  More reasonable would've been c3 which kicks the Bd4 back onto black's side of the board."

A better plan for white last move might have been 9. c3 followed by Bg5 and Nd2.  Qd2 really wound up hampering white's development!"

Black controls more space is up a pawn and after a move like Bg4 or Be6 will have completed development.  White is almost as developed but it's a lot more difficult for his Bc1 to join the fray.

During the game vhhsawb asked me about where he went wrong and I pointed to this as the losing move.  Whenever a pawn or piece is moved I like to check how this effects the rest of the board.  Here moving the pawn from b2 to b4 turns the knight which was protecting e4 and attacking d5 into a horribly pinned piece.  Only the queen protects it and now black has a good shot...

1042,39,38,2Re1,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4pb2/1P2r3/P6P/2PB1PP1/4R1K1 b - -',When you're down material exchanging pieces is frowned upon -- the goal should be to exchange pawns but to keep as many of your own pieces on the board as possible.
1043,39,39,2Rxe1+,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4pb2/1P6/P6P/2PB1PP1/4r1K1 w - -',Of course when you're up material it's hard to resist an exchange like that.
1044,39,40,2Bxe1,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4pb2/1P6/P6P/2P2PP1/4B1K1 b - -',Of course.

At this point I see that either I'm going to have to mate white in the corner with something like Be4 and Rh1 or wipe out white's pawns on the queenside and march one of my pawns to get a new queen.
1046,39,42,2g3,b'r5k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/1P6/P5PP/2b2P2/4B1K1 b - -',Hope for mate in the corner!  Time to move the rook into the action.

1050,39,46,2Kf1,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/1P6/P5PP/2b2P2/3rBK2 b - -',?  I said it was forcing Bc3!  Now white loses his last piece.
1051,39,47,2Bd3+,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/1P6/P2b2PP/5P2/3rBK2 w - -',Forcing Kg1 (which is bad) or Kg2 (which is bad but less so)
1052,39,48,2Kg2,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/1P6/P2b2PP/5PK1/3rB3 b - -',The better choice but it's too late for white to have any hope of salvaging a draw.
1053,39,49,2Rxe1,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/1P6/P2b2PP/5PK1/4r3 w - -',Now the threat is Be4  followed by Rh1#.

1060,39,56,2g4,b'6k1/pp4pp/2p2p2/4p3/PP4P1/5b1P/4r3/5K2 b - -',Why not?

Thanks to vhhsawb for the game and hopefully the annotations are instructive!"
