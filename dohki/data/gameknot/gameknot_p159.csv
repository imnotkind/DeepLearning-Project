This move isn't exactly bad but I don't recommend it unless you know exactly what you're doing. Black would be better off defending the pawn while developing a piece (…Nc6 …Nf6)."
1,0,1,h3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',? Way too slow. White also should be developing his pieces.
2,0,2,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq c6',!? Interesting. This grabs a big share of the center but again I think Black would be better off developing pieces.
3,0,3,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',! A good plan: preparing to blow the center open.
4,0,4,Bd7,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! Black now develops a piece but not the right one or to the right square. …Nf6 would be more to the point: it gets Black one step closer to castling and attacks the e-pawn. Also the LSB (Light-Squared Bishop) is better placed on e6 not d7. Development is good but should be planned out and not done randomly.
5,0,5,d4,b'rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/3p4/2p1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',! Again White has exactly the right idea: to open the center and then punish Black's slow development. White's pieces will be able to develop rapidly once the Black pawns are weakened.
6,0,6,Nc6,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2np4/2p1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Good now Black is catching up. …Nf6 is still better for the reasons stated in Black's last move.
7,0,7,Ng5,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2np4/2p1p1N1/3PP3/2P4P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',? Too much! White cannot attack with just one Knight. Bc4 was just crying out to be played.

9,0,9,Nxf7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1b1Npp/2np1n2/2p1p3/3PP3/2P4P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"?? This is the logical follow-up to White's play but it just loses a piece. Again you can't attack with just one piece! Bc4 was again obvious natural and good. Black would have no good way to defend the f-pawn.

21,0,21,1Qa5+,b'5b1r/pp1bk3/3p1p1p/q3P3/3P4/7P/PP1KQPP1/RN5r w - -',! Rather than defending Black wraps things up with a nice attack before anything strange can happen on the e-file.

24,1,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Usual move is 2.d4 but with 2. Nc3 after Black 2. ... d5 White can play 3.d4 returning to the main line.
On my opinion 2.d4 is more flexible while White can choose between 3.Nc3 3.Nd2 3.e5  after Black's usual 2. ... d5"
25,1,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',Pawn on d5 is the main idea of the move 1.c6
26,1,2,Qf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',"White try to make a surprise for Black or just don't what to play many moves in a well-known opening.
In fact so early move by a Queen usually is bad but in this position where Black made a nonactive c6 it is possible not losing much (only the White's opening advantage).
Possible Black answers are:
a) 3. ... de (like it was in the game)
b) 3. ... e6?! after 4.d4! Nf6 5. Bg5 Be7 6.e5 Nfd7 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Qg3 0-0 White are good. So do they after 4. ... Nd7 5.ed cd 6.Bd3
c) 3. ... d4!? very active move was tried with success by Daniel Fridman 1996 4.Bc4 e6 5.Nce2 Nf6 6.e5 Nfd7 7.Qe4 Nb6 8.Bb3 c5 9.c3 Bd7 10.Nf3 Bc6 11.Qg4 h5 12.Qg3 h4 13.

d)3. ... Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 e6 6. Nh3 Be7 7.Qg3 g6 8.Bd3 and White has space and Black has weakness.

The one thing that unite all this lines starting 3.Qf3 that they are not used by the top rated players only in the games with a weak opponents.

399,20,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Again e4 (the King's Pawn Opening) and b3 (the Nimzovich-Larsen Attack) are both reasonable moves on their own but they don't go well together. With e4 you started occupying the center and you ought to develop quickly while supporting you foothold in the center or attacking Black's – Nf3 Nc3 f4 d4 and Bc4 are all better moves.
400,20,1,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/3PP3/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq d3',White does well to claim a greater share of the center. Normally I would tell you to develop your other minor pieces and castle before making this move but in this case Nc3/d2 would remove a supporter of d4 while Bc4/b5 would allow Black to hit back with …Nf6.

This move does nothing to aid your development weakens your pawn structure (we haven't gone over what that means yet I know) and just forces the Black Bishop to go to a better square.
403,20,4,Bb6,b'r1bqk1nr/p1p2ppp/1bpp4/8/1P2P3/2P5/PB3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',This move is fine but …Rb8 would have been a fancy way to develop a piece while indirectly protecting the Bishop.

I hope you are all having a nice weekend.  After coming on the wrong end of a tactical melee in my previous annotated game at least The Beginner got one tactic right in her game against a Class A 1800+ player called Jean-Pierre.  I drew my MT game with him as white so it was nice to get a win with the black pieces over him.  I played against The Vienna Opening which I remember trying out against Coach Ion without too much success.  The gameknot analysis link to the game is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15246679&fb=1&rnd=0.599032368192871.  The moves of this opening are e4 e5 and Nc3 rather than Nf3."

Some may ask why I haven't bothered with ...a6 over the last couple of moves and the reason is that I felt that white's knight was a tad misplaced on b5 with little to do and actually would be more useful if it was withdrawn to c3 where it could eye the central light squares and maybe jump to d5 in the future.

If he had played c4 I would have been tempted to exchange as after N(g8) to either f6 or e7 he can play Ng5. Also I didn't really fancy the sharp lines of the Benoni or Benko Gambit reversed after 7. c4 d5.
767,34,7,f6,b'r2qk1nr/pp4pp/2nbbp2/2p1p3/2NpP3/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',After 8. Nc4 he really can play Ng5 again so I stop it with f6. So now he can exchange on d6 but hey what of it. The Bd6 is my bad bishop blocked in by pawns I don't mind exchanging it! Now my Be3 that is another question I am going to hang on to that. I could have doubled his pawns with Be3xNc4 here but it would have been a huge mistake to give up my good bishop just to double his pawns.

The advantages of having it on g6 is that White no longer has the queen check on h5 and in some variations I may be able to play my knight to h4. The disadvantage is that in some variations I would like to play g7-g5 to force the hand of his Bishop on f4. On balance g6 is better.

785,34,25,exf4,b'2r2rk1/6pp/p3b3/1p1q2Q1/3pNp2/3P4/PP6/R4RK1 w - -',As I had seen - but after I had moved Qd5 26. f5! would have given White a good game. The points being is the White would love to play Nf6+ and either fork my king or queen or win my queen with a discovered attack on my queen with his queen. Now for that to work either my protection of f6 by my rook on f8 has to be broken or my bishop's protection of my queen needs be ended. So I cannot retreat my bishop to f7 because of the former nor to d7 because of the latter. Likewise I cannot safely take on f5 without losing my queen. So I would have had to lose my bishop for a pawn and with Knight v 3 pawns White would have a slightly better ending.
