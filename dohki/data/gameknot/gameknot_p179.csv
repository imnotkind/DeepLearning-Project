I would like to draw your attention to the fact that when you castle kingside your h and your g columns can become very vulnerable to mating attacks.  Black who is a Class D player did not sort out his problems with the h column in a timely manner and as a result got Freddied.  This was really sad because Freddy had made a horrible blunder costing him a rook for a pawn.  If Waxwing (John) had done something about the h column then he could well have gone on to the Chessic Upset of the Century!  This game came from the Stonewall project which I am not taking part in but I did see this game and thought it very interesting to annotate.  The game starts with Freddy playing 1. d4."
80,4,1,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',3. Bd3 - this move to d3 hits at h7 and hints at a possible future Q/B line up on the b1-h7 diagonal.

John (Waxwing) was a very happy man at this point.  Now wouldn't we all be happy with this position against Freddy?

This is going back nearly two years when I was a Class C player.  I feel that the Dentist (who has a current Class D rating of 1363) ought to be a Class C player too and this game illustrates the facts.  He gave me nothing in this game and made no obvious mistakes and I ended up having to tread carefully to avoid an ignominious defeat.  In the end I ended up conceding a Low Draw luckily the game was unrated so I did not incur any penalty points with that result.  Just as well because Gameknot Analysis told me I had a won position aargh and double aargh.  Here is the link to gameknot analysis:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=9023239&fb=1&rnd=0.09381839335531355.  White kicks off with 1. d4."

White's king really looks as though he is running the show but looks can be very deceptive.  I the Class C player I was at the time was certainly deceived so much so I conceded an unnecessary Low Draw my only consolation is is that the game was unrated.

153,8,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',In two previous games he opened with an early b5.  I won one and he the other.  In the game I won I immediately replied 2.g3 and he played mechanically dropping the a8 rook.  When he won his play was far beyond my own.  I don't know what happens sometimes.  I feel bulletproof but then along comes a player who sees the swiss cheese in my position.  I usually get dominated in the GK rated games and not in faster over the board play.  It does happen but less frequently.
154,8,1,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',And he continues more cautiously here.  Perhaps having won once he sees that my play can be strong when I omit reckless moves?  This move is quite reasonable as it seems unlikely that white would take the time to develop a kingside fianchetto only to trade it away to obscure black's queenside fianchetto when the bishop can still reasonably be played to either a6 immediately or to another square once it is prepared.
155,8,2,a3,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/4p3/2P5/P5P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Mostly prophylaxis but not entirely as the move prepares the b4 advance.  The b4 advance will open a diagonal for the c1 bishop keeps the f8 bishop off of c5 for the time being and is generally a thematic move in the English opening.
156,8,3,Bb7,b'r2qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1pn5/4p3/2P5/P5P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Playing Bc5 here would likely keep the game out of the dangerous waters it enters later by tempting e3 but also within the realm of possibility is 4...Bc5 5.b4 Bd4 6.Nc3 when black can trade a thrice-moved (once the trade is complete) bishop for a once moved knight.

159,8,6,Nd4,b'1r1qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/pp3n2/4p3/1PPn4/P1NP2P1/4PPBP/1RBQK1NR w Kk -',! In a few short moves black's position has become reasonably good.  He has a centrally posted knight he is poised to trade off White's light-square control and he is in no immediate danger however his play can have a dark side:
160,8,7,e4,b'1r1qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/pp3n2/4p3/1PPnP3/P1NP2P1/5PBP/1RBQK1NR b Kk e3',This may seem like a concession but the truth is the Botvinnik style of play is one of my favorite lines in the English opening.  I had attempted to play these style of lines once against this player but he attacked my queenside before I could get the attack rolling.  Here the center and queenside are sound for the moment though they can be attacked; he cannot immediately unravel them.
161,8,8,g6,b'1r1qkb1r/1bpp1p1p/pp3np1/4p3/1PPnP3/P1NP2P1/5PBP/1RBQK1NR w Kk -',Would c6 followed by d5 suit his purposes better?  I think that c6 and d5 are pretty good moves for black.  These moves seem to but do not actually force the concession of the f2-f3 pawn advance and the move also seems to stall white's immediate plans kingside assault.  If 9...c6 10.c5 does prevent 10...d5 but fails to prevent d5 entirely.  After 10...bxc5 black can continue to rip open the queenside with 11...cxb4 12.axb4.  Shredder evaluates this position as a miniscule edge to black and I have to say I would not want to play the white pieces in this variation.  White seems to have no natural plans or even natural moves there so that leaves us considering if not f3 then the exchanges either weaken the white center (9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.Be3 dxe4) create a queenside attacking position that Shredder says favors white and avoids an isolated queen pawn(9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.cxd5 cxd5 12.Nxd4 exd4 13.Qa4+) or leave white with an isolated queen pawn (9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.cxd5 -hoping to retain the kingside attack lines- 11...cxd5 -denying the kingside attack lines- 12.exd5 Nxd5 13.O-O) which Shredder evaluates as merely equal.  I think both sides are fairly well suited to IQP play here except that the other line seems to offer white an edge.  White is suited to IQP play as no minor or major pieces have been traded but so is black because he has a knight posted in front of the pawn preventing it from having the typical advantages used in IQP play: advancement promotion and attack; and black seems on the edge of being able to trade of the g2 bishop when general theory says that the side with the IQP should avoid trading minor and major pieces.
162,8,9,1f4,b'1r1q1rk1/1bpp1pbp/pp3np1/4p3/1PPnPP2/P1NP2P1/4N1BP/1RBQ1RK1 b - f3',! In these kingside advances black despite castling and making sound moves can find his entire kingside problematic.  White wants to attack the f6 g6 and h7 squares.  He will even sacrifice the f rook to do it if it promises a good attack.  The black moves c6 and d5 here would attack white in the center but allow the immediate fxe5 which is not in white's plans but does undermine black's attack on d5 because the knight is forced to move.  I still think that c6 and d5 were pretty good moves for black but probably not now.  Even so black needs a central attack sooner or later as a central attack must be good for black as the attacking move f5 creates vulnerabilities in the white position that can be exploited.  The downside is that black may want to move his king away from the white attack and these moves will make the rest of the board less of a haven for the monarch.
163,8,10,1Nxe2,b'1r1q1rk1/1bpp1pbp/pp3np1/4p3/1PP1PP2/P2P2P1/4N1BP/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',!  The correct move bringing the knight over to the kingside even though Shredder prefers Qxe2.

Black ignores the central push as seems appropriate now and shores up structure waiting for white's attack.
165,8,12,1h3,b'1r1q1rk1/1bp2pbp/pp1p1np1/4p3/1PP1PP2/P2P2PP/4N1B1/1RBQ1RK1 b - -',Quite often black's light-square bishop has been placed on d7 when black plans on Qc8 Bxh3 and if it works out a bishop exchange and the black queen sitting imposingly in the white kingside but here the white light-square bishop is out of position threatening a rather secure pawn.  Shredder is still reporting an ever slight edge for white.
166,8,13,1Nd7,b'1r1q1rk1/1bpn1pbp/pp1p2p1/4p3/1PP1PP2/P2P2PP/4N1B1/1RBQ1RK1 w - -',The knight is going to need to move but this underestimates the white threat.  At a glance to someone unfamiliar with White's kingside chances white's pawn formation may look whimsical and outside of sound chess.  It is.  White may be able to transition to an end-game but this formation has one aim: attack.  Shredder would place the black queen on d7 instead eyeing into the kingside.  I cannot really argue except to say that Bc8 seems to offer the same.

His knight queen and bishop all eye the square.  White sees the point too and intends g4 for this and because g3 is a good spot for his knight.  15...a5 threatens an opening in the queenside.

Any time that white takes to reposition his king gives time to black to prepare an initiative.  The problem is that white's pieces are somewhat in the way of each other.  Ke2 blocks the queen in.  Ke3 hangs the g pawn.  The bishop will be traded for two pawns but white can exert some control on how it happens.  Shredder recommends fxg7.  I recommend 24.Qg4 Bxf6 25.gxf6 Qxf6+ 26.Ke2 Qg7.  White is safe and has a lead although it is still a fight.  I had considered Nh5 instead but I suspected he would gladly trade the bishop for two pawns plus knight as 24.Nh5 gxh5 25.Qxg5 Bxf6 26.Ke2 (26.gxf6 Qxf6+ 27.Ke1 Qg6! leaves black exposed but okay with the white attack dissapating) Nd4+ 27.Kd4 Qg6!.

With white in the posession of a theoretical +3 material advantage black offers an attacking lane that also hampers his queenside advance.  It's hard to see an immediate downside to white accepting the offer.  If white accepts black will be compelled to recapture with the 'wrong' pawn.

This move is bad. I played it because it threatens Qxb7 but playing Qxb7so early is rarely a good move in most positions. The reason why Qxb7 is almost always bad is because Black can place his rook on the b-file forcing the white queen to the edge of the board where it can possibly be trapped or taken out of play. As a result If white does decide to play Qxb7 then extremely accurate play is required to gain a plus from the extra pawn

Also the idea of 6. d3 is fine for black

The GK engine book ends here with this move and assesses the position as +1.37 in favour of White.  How accurate is this assessment?  The alternatives 5.Nxf7 and 5.d4 are considered more compromising for White especially the N capture which provokes a vicious counter-attack by 5...Bxf2+!  (NOTE: where I give GK evaluations + will indicate a White edge; - (minus) a Black advantage).

There doesn't seem to be any special reason why not unless White anticipates he would probably have to move the thing again.  Incidentally the GK engine assessed this position at +0.52 - a come-down from two moves ago.  Why?  Was there a better alternative?  Or is the position so full of possibilities that a consistent assessment is hard to arrive at?

A mistake according to the GK engine anticipating Black's attack by 12...Qe8?  13.h3 Bh5  (Better might be 13...Bd7) 14.0-0 Kd8!? 15.Nc4 Bc5  16.d4 and White is building up an imposing centre as counter to Black's K-side pressure.  Would I have followed this line?  As it happened White deviated at once from this recommneded line.  Meanwhile GK preferred 12...Nh5 13.Qe2!? Nf4  14.Qf1 Rf6  15.Bc4 Bxf3  16.Nxf3 Nh3!  17.d4 exd4  18.cxd4 Ba5+  19.Kf1 Kf8 with close to an even game.  I don't recall that at this point of the game I was giving ...Nh5 much thought at all.

Incontrast to the +0.94 assessment awarded the 13.h3 line GK assesses this position at +0.30 but without further comment.  White is being cagey here: keeping open which side upon which to castle and preparing - it seemed to me - a counter-action in the centre.
511,21,16,1Qh5,b'r4r2/ppp1k1pp/1b1p1n2/4p2q/4P1b1/1BPP1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',(!?) Consistent but GK misliked this move as well again in favour of ...Nh5.  The line it suggests goes 13...Nh5 14.h3 Bxf3  15.Nxf3 Nf4  16.Rh2 Qg6 (16...Qh5!?) 17.Kf1 Qh5 with K-side pressure.  If then 18.d4 Nxg2  19.Rxg2 Qxf3  20.Rxg7+ Kd8.  At this point GK gives 21.Rxh7 but then Black would gain a big advantage by 21...Qh1+.  Better seems 21.Be6.
512,21,17,1h3,b'r4r2/ppp1k1pp/1b1p1n2/4p2q/4P1b1/1BPP1N1P/PPQN1PP1/R3K2R b KQ -',(!?) Instead of this GK had suggested 14.d4 with the continuation 14...Bxf3  15.Nxf3 exd4  16.Nxd4 Ng4  17.f3 Ne3  18.Qf2 Qg5  19.Rg1 Ng4  20.h4! Nxf2  21.hxg5 Bxd4  22.cxd4 and the assessment +0.91.  On the whole that assessment seems reasonable going into an ending a pawn ahead for which Black has almost no compensation.  But as GK assessed White position after the text move (14.h3) at only a little less (+0.88) it seems hardly objectionable.

Whatever its objective value I did have a long-term idea in mind to attack as quickly as possible on the Q-side if the White King should fetch up there.  For the moment the White h-pawn is pinned.

The fact is Black's resources are still mainly trained upon the K-side and the castled King would have received a thorough mauling: 15.0-0?? Bxh3!  16.gxh3 Qxh3 17.d4 Ng4 and with the rook about to enter the fray via f6 White would be hard put to survive.

I did consider this move - almost played it in fact.  But it didn't seem to offer much.  The line given by GK seems typical: 16...Qg6  17.g4 Ne8  18.Nh4 Qh6  19.Nf5+ Bxf5 (already I'm none too enchanted with this line) 20.gxf5 Kd8  21.Nc4 Bc5  22.Rg1  Qxh3  23.0-0-0 Qf3.  Although GK assesses this as +0.06 - practically even - I can't say I go a bundle over it for Black especially as 21.Be6 seems a vast improvement in this line.

Well maybe the play of both sides is improveable hereabouts.  I was trying to play actively and 'forcing it' a bit.  Possibly a more cagey approach was called for objectively speaking.

But I had something rather more emphatic in mind as will soon appear.

Sure this was speculative but I felt that Black's resources were enough to see me through for a draw.  The response of the GK engine was interesting. Before this move GK thought the position +0.20; after it +0.33.  Such a small change in assessment is trivial.  Though speculative the sac was at least playable.

It is at this point that Fischer used to go into what he called a 'big think'.  So it was here.  How to feed the flames of attack?  The answer was soon reached: shove more wood on the fire.  Much of the 'big think' was confirming this second sac was playable...

But the attack is still speculative (check out White's material edge at +3).  At this point the GK engine evaluated the position at +0.59 - slight edge to White.  However I felt the attack should be good for a draw ... at least.  After all according to GK I have 2.41 pawns' worth of spatial and temporal advantages... :)

The reason is that the rook so wants to land on this square - you wouldn't believe how close I came to playing it.  The problem though is that after 30...Rb3 31.Qa2 it was devilishly hard to find any kind of worthwhile follow-up.  The relatively quiet bishop move frees the a-pawn to advance which in turn gives a square to the under-employed bishop on c7.

(extraordinary line) 36.Rxd5 a3  37.Kc1 Rxf2  38.Re3 Rf1+  39.Kc2 Ke6 (-0.48 - i.e. a slight edge for Black).  But  after...

Not too bad for me since it gives him opportunities to make mistakes. In a blitz-game only five minutes before this game I had lost a Najdorf as black quite badly which my opponent had seen so I suppose he did not think I know this variation very well. (And truly I don't.)

731,29,6,Nxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1Nppn2/6B1/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',It took me quite a while to decide to capture the knight. The other possibility would have been to complete development with say Be2 but I thought that normally at this stage Black prevents the e5-thrust which Nc6 doesn't. Therefore the logical plan would be to play e5 and force him to weaken his kingside. 
732,29,7,bxc6,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pppn2/6B1/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Still blitz tempo but then what else should he do?
733,29,8,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pppn2/4P1B1/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Logically. It seems a bit absurd to me though that white is attacking despite not having completed development. Still in this respect black is not better. 
734,29,9,h6,b'r1bqkb1r/5pp1/p1pppn1p/4P1B1/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This is forced unless black wants to play with a piece less. (It wouldn't have bothered me though.)

But I thought that I might get quite some pressure on the kingside to compensate for that. He is behind in development - even more so if he plays dxe5. If he doesn't I can play exd6 after which his pawn structure is no better than mine if we reach an endgame. At this stage I found it rather unlikely however that we would reach an endgame. The position is absolutely not balanced; a perfect setup for a future tactical strike. 
736,29,11,1Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/5p2/p1ppp2p/3NP1P1/7B/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',The main alternatives would have been Ne4 or Qh5. The Nd5 seemed a strong piece to me; after my two pawns on e5 and g5 are gone (which I was sure they would be soon) it might come back to f6 as a defender. Also I did not want it to be able to exchange on c3 after 12.Qh5 Nxc3 leaving my queenside wide open should he ever want to attack there. Looking through this right now I wonder whether this does actually matter by now. It is quite obvious that my king will not be safe wherever he goes - nor will his. 
737,29,12,1cxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/5p2/p2pp2p/3pP1P1/7B/8/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Yay I got him to think for at least five minutes! This was more psychological. For now I knew that he was not playing theory any more which I always consider reassuring. Especially since the last round I had lost (in a Najdorf) after about 20 moves; my opponent had used about three minutes of his time and only played theory until I was dead lost. 
738,29,13,1Qh5,b'r1bqkb1r/5p2/p2pp2p/3pP1PQ/7B/8/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Obviously. Pressuring f7 since his knights are gone. Except for that I was playing with thoughts not so much of gxh6 but rather g6 discovering an attack on his queen and also some faint ideas of a sacrifice.

If he doesn't do so I can already play g6 but after the game we came to the conclusion that 14...Ra7 was much stronger. It does protect f7 as well without restricting the queen. But just to give you an idea how complex the position is another possibility would have been 14...Qb4!? eg.15.g6 Qxb2 16.gxf7+ Kd8 17.Rc1 dxe5 which - to me - seems to be rather equal.

Note that after 15...fxg6 16.Qxg6+ Qf7 17.Qf6 Qxf6 18.exf6 White is a pawn down and might convert this into a win - or at least he is not worse. This was enough for my opponent to refrain from it since I was after all the underdog. (Sometimes there are huge advantages in this...)

Unfortunately this was exactly what I was hoping for. 16.gxf7+ Qxf7 17.Qxe5 or 16.Bf6 Rg8 17.gxf7+ Qxf7 18.Qe5 both lead to a good position for White but...Can you guess the next move?

The idea had first occured to me after move 13 and I could simply not find a refutation. He has no squares where to move his king and 16...Bd7?? 17.gxf7# is checkmate so he has to take. Even after the match assisted by a master we did not find the correct refutation. There is one but it by far exceeds both our abilities to calculate. Now the question is: can you call considering the circumstances such a sacrifice sound? I would call it at least beneficial but still I'd like to know how you think about such moves (and whether you would play them or not).

838,31,46,4Kd5,b'8/3k4/3P3p/pp1K2p1/8/PP6/7P/8 b - -',I offered a draw here and that's exactly what this position boils down to. Though with all the possibilities it would take me a long time to explain them all. So I'll try to do my best. I still wonder if I had played Ke5 if it would have made any difference in the long run but I would think it doubtful.
839,31,47,4h5,b'8/3k4/3P4/pp1K2pp/8/PP6/7P/8 w - -',The best move in the position white can't go for the queen side pawns because of black's king side pawns; would win the race.  Any king move would be bad for black also either a4 b4 or b4 a4 leads to just enough time for white to win the queen race by one move allowing white the chance for perpetual.  Work it out yourself it's rather interesting. The last move g4 would also lead to a draw but this one is quite a bit more complex. 45... g4 46. a4 bxa4 (forced) 47. bxa4 white forces black to move! h5 48. Kf5 h4 49. Kf4 g3 not allowing white to win the race and the game. 50. hxg3 and here the game diverges into two paths.  Black can play h3 or hxg3 lets look at h3 first. 51. Kf3 h2 52. Kg2 Kxd6 53. Kxh2 Kc5 54. g4 Kb4 55. g5 Kxa4 56. g6 Kb4 57. g7 and as you can see white queens before black even 52... h1=Q+ doesn't help because black doesn't queen in time for even a check. Going back to 50... hxg3 51. Kxg3 and now black seems to have the win but white has a clever draw. Kxd6 52. Kf2 Kc5 53. Ke1 Kb4 54. Kd1 black now has two tries both end in draw. Ka3 55. Kc1 Ka2 56. Kc2 Ka3 57. Kb1 and white finds the corner. Or 54... Kxa4 55. Kc1 Ka3 56. Kb1 and white finds the corner point is that black cannot force the pawn to a1 because the white king just keeps going back and forth between a1 and b1 eventually black traps the King on a1 and either gives up the pawn for draw by insignificant material or stalemate.
840,31,48,4Ke5,b'8/3k4/3P4/pp2K1pp/8/PP6/7P/8 b - -',! forcing the draw.
841,31,49,4b4,b'8/3k4/3P4/p3K1pp/1p6/PP6/7P/8 w - -',white can exchange here. Blacks best try is to play h4 here in that case white would lock the queen side pawns when the opportunity arises.
842,31,50,Kxd6,b'8/8/3k4/5Kpp/1p6/1P6/7P/8 w - -',Note: g4 Kg5 leads to no tempo loss the position remains the same.
843,31,51,5Kg4,b'8/8/8/8/1p1k2K1/1P6/7P/8 b - -',Draw is agreed upon here because the race ends with a queen on h8 and a queen on b1 with white to move but neither side has any hope of victory. Note: after black gets 53...  Kxb3 54. h3 Kc3?? would be a major mistake because white would queen with check giving a critical tempo white would be winning here. Work out the win with a computer or for yourself it's a rather important knowledge just force the king in front of the pawn and move the white king closer and closer. Side note: In the case of white queening first and the king is near the pawn on the rook2(7) and bishop2(7) pawns the game would be drawn.
