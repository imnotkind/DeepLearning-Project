2,0,2,exd5,b'1rbq1rk1/3pbpp1/p1p4p/p1Pp4/3P4/P2BPN2/2QB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now Black has structural weaknesses--two sets of doubled pawns that will be vulnerable.  Offsetting that is temporary control of the b file.
3,0,3,1Rab1,b'1rbq1rk1/3pbpp1/p1p4p/p1Pp4/3P4/P2BPN2/2QB1PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',Fighting for the b file immediately.  
4,0,4,1Rxb1,b'2bq1rk1/3pbpp1/p1p4p/p1Pp4/3P4/P2BPN2/2QB1PPP/1r3RK1 w - -',Bb7 might have been slightly better but the B would have been a lousy piece there.
5,0,5,Bh4,b'2bq1rk1/3p1pp1/p1p4p/p1Pp4/3P3b/P2BPN2/2QB1PPP/1R4K1 w - -',Not sure of the rationale for this move.  Generally Black would want to avoid trades when behind in material.
6,0,6,2Bd6,b'2b1r1k1/3p1pp1/p1pB1q1p/2Pp4/3P4/P2BP3/2Q2PPP/1R4K1 b - -',The d6 Bishop now keep the c8 Bishop out of play.  Black is effectively two pieces down.
7,0,7,2Rb8,b'1RB1r3/3p1p1k/2pB2pp/p1Pp2q1/3P4/P3P3/5PPP/3Q2K1 b - -',This was unnecessarily complex.  Bb7 would have worked just fine.
8,0,8,Qd8,b'1B1q4/3B1p1k/2p3pp/2Pp4/p2P4/P3P3/5PPP/3Q2K1 w - -',Already ahead in material White will now gain several passed pawns at the cost of the Bishop.
9,0,9,3Qd7+,b'8/2qQ3k/6pp/2Pp1p2/B2P4/P3P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',Forces the exchange of Queens.  Black's King alone will be unable to stop the pawns running free.
10,0,10,4Bc4,b'8/k7/P5pp/2P2p2/2BP4/4PPP1/7P/6K1 b - -',Now Black's King is tied down to the a-pawn.  White's f3 prepares for yet another passed pawn.
11,0,11,4e6,b'1k6/8/P3P2p/2P5/2BP2p1/6P1/7P/6K1 b - -',Black's King cannot stop all of the passers especially with the Bishop helping out from the rear.

34,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I basically always play e4. I'm a huge fan of regular open tactical sharp play.
35,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He plays e5- I relax these are the games where I can use openings I'm a lot more familiar with.
36,2,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',So I play Nf3 again my usual.
37,2,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And Black goes for the Philidor's Defense. I'm not a real fan of this opening for Black. I think it's a tad passive and allows White to just charge right into the center with attacking power. I can't remember any time where this opening gave me pause- is there a value in e5-d6 this soon at all?
38,2,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',So like I said I just eagerly charge right in. Main line for White.
39,2,5,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He takes. Probably best- I can't see much value in Bg4 if White has dxe5.
40,2,6,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I prefer Nxd4. Qxd4 apparently does equally well in the databases but say if you've played the Scandinavian defense as White Qxd4 is usually immediately met by Black playing Nc6. Why throw a queen out when it just gets chased away?
41,2,7,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black develops sensing a more urgent need to castle instead of trying maybe Nc6.
42,2,8,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I continue my development seizing more control over d5 and e4.
43,2,9,a6,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He plays this apparently the so-called Berger variation. I don't like this line at all. Yes this stops White from putting either knight or the Bishop on b5 but this is passive for Black's developing and it's not like Black can't hold a grip on c6 in case I were to try and go in that way. If Black's king were in danger I think the alternative ...Be7 would help get the King in a position to hide away sooner.
44,2,10,Be2,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',This bishop has nowhere good to go now on the other hand so I push it here to further prevent Bg4 from Black and I ready myself to castle.
45,2,11,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Once again opting to passively protect the two strongest squares for the bishops to be on but I think this is mostly a waste of time for Black. Black only has 1 back rank piece and no stake in the center against my near perfect control of the center and three developed back pieces! White is clearly better here.
46,2,12,O-O,b'rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Putting my king away and allowing several possibilities for White's next best moves ranging anywhere from f4 Re1 Bc4... the list continues.
47,2,13,Bd7,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Once again I think he's worrying about the wrong bishop. Why not Be7?
48,2,14,Be3,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',This was more of a waiting move. It maintains control over d4 and opens the door for the Queen to join the bishop on a possible h6 attack if the Black King castles short. Black must consider carefully.
49,2,15,Nh7,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1ppn/p2p3p/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',...Okay I'm out of ideas. Why this???
50,2,16,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1ppn/p2p3p/8/3NP1B1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I miscalculated the strength of his next move or even the strength of my bishop compared to his here. Frankly looking back I wish I tried f4 here or something.
51,2,17,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP1B1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',He moves the knight back. Not sure if I like the repetition of moves out of Black... the other knight on b8 was already protecting the Bd7 with the Queen. Heck would even Ng5 be better?
52,2,18,1Bf5,b'rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I know that I can't move the bishop to h3 and retreating seems like ripping a page out of the book I'm preaching against. So I try to make the most out of a miscalculation hoping to tempt Black into playing g6 and weakening the kingside even further.
53,2,19,1Be7,b'rn1qk2r/1ppbbpp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black finally plays this aiming to castle not seeming to mind the thought of my bishop on f5 yet.
54,2,20,1Qf3,b'rn1qk2r/1ppbbpp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',So I play this having a plan to keep my control of f5 in case he decides to start an exchange.
55,2,21,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He finally hides the king away to safety.
56,2,22,1h4,b'rn1q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP2P/2N1BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - h3',There was an idea behind this but once again I think I miscalculated the situation. The idea here was to pin the pawn on h6 down and the g7 pawn would remain frozen in place as a result. It increases focus on the center and I would have superior pressure against his King in the end of the exchanges. Of course this didn't quite go according to plan but I can't say it was a complete failure either- my ideas wouldn't have worked if this pawn was still on h2. What was my best move here?
57,2,23,1Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p1np1n1p/5B2/3NP2P/2N1BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Anyway Black starts pointing his spears toward my center pieces and I need to start considering how I want the exchange combinations carefully. Frankly Black probably had the right idea here.
58,2,24,1Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p1np1n1p/3N1B2/3NP2P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',I begin by threatening more pieces than Black. It's tough to say if this is inaccurate or not.
59,2,25,1Nxd5,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p1np3p/3n1B2/3NP2P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',But he exchanges for this knight. I'm just going to stop speculating all combinations- after if you have ideas could you post them at the end of this set? For now I'll just go over my viewpoints:
60,2,26,1Nxc6,b'r2q1rk1/1ppbbpp1/p1Np3p/3n1B2/4P2P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',I exchange this knight first to cause more of an instability on his queenside and an attack on his Queen to boot. Black can't counterthreat so this knight has to be addressed right now.
61,2,27,1Bxc6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p1bp3p/3n1B2/4P2P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Except I was expecting him to capture with the pawn first. So I thought I'd still have Bxd7 after.
62,2,28,1exd5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p1bp3p/3P1B2/7P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Instead I try to launch what I thought would be cutting my losses but...
63,2,29,1Bb5,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/7P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - -',...while I did eventually see this bishop landing here as a possible outcome this was way back when I had the other bishop and two knights barking down b5. So no I didn't exactly see this coming once the exchanges started and immediately I was cursing not looking closer after the fact.
64,2,30,1Rfc1,b'r2q1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/7P/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R1R3K1 b - -',I know that I can't save the pawn on h4 now but it doesn't seem like a lost cause either. I tried to force this rook onto the square where it would be the safest from harms way for the next 2-3 turns. (I picked wrong.)
65,2,31,1Bxh4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/7b/4BQ2/PPP2PP1/R1R3K1 w - -',The bishop eats the dropped pawn but now I have an idea to begin a trap in mind.
66,2,32,1g3,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/7b/4BQP1/PPP2P2/R1R3K1 b - -',Starting here. I want to force the bishop away and I give my King a flight square. 
67,2,33,1Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p1b1p/1b1P1B2/8/4BQP1/PPP2P2/R1R3K1 w - -',Black then puts the bishop here. The threat should be obvious but I was just too confused at why Black hadn't played Bg5 instead and I was also too focused on my plan to notice what he was doing.
68,2,34,1Kg2,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p1b1p/1b1P1B2/8/4BQP1/PPP2PK1/R1R5 b - -',So I do this. Perhaps it'd have been better for White to wait longer.
69,2,35,1Bxb2,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/8/4BQP1/PbP2PK1/R1R5 w - -',This was the first clearly obvious mistake I made this match.
70,2,36,1Rch1,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/8/4BQP1/PbP2PK1/R6R b - -',But it's okay because I'm also sure that I have just barely enough resources in place to launch one final all out attack even if I just dropped another rook...
71,2,37,1Bxa1,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/1b1P1B2/8/4BQP1/P1P2PK1/b6R w - -',Black eagerly eats the rook. I am now down a full Rook and two pawns at this point.
72,2,38,2Bxh6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p3B/1b1P1B2/8/5QP1/P1P2PK1/b6R b - -',And I guess to Black's shock I didn't revenge capture the Bishop either. There would have been no point- if I was wrong about the power of my remaining pieces I was sure I was going to lose anyway Bishop or not. But all my remaining pieces remain extremely powerful against his uncoordinated ones. After all it's the Philidor's Defense we're talking here so CHARGE!!!!!
73,2,39,2Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p1b1B/1b1P1B2/8/5QP1/P1P2PK1/7R w - -',I'm not sure if Black saw more defensive value out of his own bishop or saw more risks in taking mine. I'm not sure what was Black's best move here.
74,2,40,2Qg4,b'r2q1rk1/1pp2pp1/p2p1b1B/1b1P1B2/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R b - -',But I did know I was very happy in pinning that pawn. Now the Bh6 lives whether Black wants it to or not and I have a very dangerous attack in mind.
75,2,41,2c6,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p1pp1b1B/1b1P1B2/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R w - -',An attack that Black completely overlooks and resumes trying to gain even more material.
76,2,42,2Bh7+,b'r2q1rk1/1p3ppB/p1pp1b1B/1b1P4/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R b - -',If it's material Black wants I'm offering it. (Frankly I was quite worried about Black playing g6 I wasn't too sure of my options after that.) But now the Black King is forced to move and neither square looks that great for him.
77,2,43,2Kxh7,b'r2q1r2/1p3ppk/p1pp1b1B/1b1P4/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R w - -',He captures. Fantastic! I might be a full Pawn Rook and Bishop down now (the power of a Queen!!!) but I was certain Black's King just walked into a trap he would not be walking out of alive. I was definitely more concerned with the King biding his time with Kh8...
78,2,44,2Bxg7+,b'r2q1r2/1p3pBk/p1pp1b2/1b1P4/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R b - -',Instead I open the discovered check. Black is severely compromised but I was pretty sure all options at least turned the situation in complete favor White if not at least a Mate in no less than 10 moves.
79,2,45,2Kg8,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pB1/p1pp1b2/1b1P4/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R w - -',Instead Black makes his final fatal blunder. Giving the bishop via Bh4 was the only saving move.
80,2,46,2Bxf6#,b'r2q1rk1/1p3p2/p1pp1B2/1b1P4/6Q1/6P1/P1P2PK1/7R b - -',MATE! I have never seen myself in a steadily worsening material disadvantage (the move before this I was at MINUS EIGHT!) to land myself into a checkmate. I was very thrilled to have pulled this off even against a lower ranked opponent as I was sure I made so many mistakes this match. Was there ways for both sides to have played this better?

I played e4 completing my opening development and was fairly confident going into the late opening early middle game. I neglected to castle which probably was a mistake. I've been experimenting with waiting longer to castle and seeing how the game develops with the rapid development that not sacrificing a move to castling allows.

My opponent took my pawn on e4 effectively beginning the material exchanges that are usually inevitable in blitz games.  "

I took my opponents Knight on f2 with my King and he responded by checking my King with his Queen on c5 and attacking my Knight on c4. This was a very bad move on my part. Going back to move 10 had I taken the Bishop on d6 with my Knight I would have forked his King and Bishop. This would have allowed me to gain the Knight on f2 without losing any material. I noticed this immediately after I made the move but unfortunately it was a blitz game and I was trying to play intuitively. Looking back this may have been my worst move. "

I wanted to regain some tempo and material and I saw a clear opportunity to do so by taking my opponents Bishop on d6...

At this point I expected to bring a rook to the semi-open d file and have my opponent castle. My opponent blocked the check by moving his Knight to d7. "

I strengthened my control of the d file by bringing my Rook from a over to d1 supporting my Queen. My opponent moved his Queen to d2 I guess attacking the b pawn and planning the check that would be a result. I believe better for black would have been to Castle here. I had already considered this move by black when I moved my queen to d6. My Knight on f3 would block at d2 and attack forcing him to move to a4 or b5/b6. Qa2 would be a major blunder on his part.

I moved my Rook on a to d2 with the intention of doubling my rooks and gaining more control of the d file. My opponent responded by moving his Queen to a4. I'm not sure what his plan was here.

Had black not sacrificed his rook at move 18... you have: 19. Nxf7+ Ke8 20. Qe7#

All in all a good game. Black made some poor choices as did I. I submit the game wondering how I played it wrong outside of move 11. I really enjoyed this game. Up until the end I never really felt confident in a victory. I'm proud of the result obviously but I really like saving all of my games and reviewing them. Annotating them is a good way to see where my mindset is as I progress.

White can secure his a-pawn through a5 and then a6 but my if my rook gets forced off the second row after that with Nc1 the rook gets to relocate via Ra3+ to f3 thus keeping the pressure on f2.
255,9,21,Kd6,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp3p1/P1P1r3/2KN4/5PnP/5R2 w - -',Activating the king. Rh4 doesn't seem great as white can defend with f3 followed by Rf2
256,9,22,Rd4,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp3p1/P1Pr4/2KN4/5PnP/3R4 w - -',Going for Ke6 may have been a good option as well with the purpose of further attacking the kind side. I played the rook instead to prevent the white rook from potentially creating problems by picking apart my queen side after penetrating the back rows.
257,9,23,3Rd2,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp3p1/P1Pr4/2KN4/3R1PnP/8 b - -',Now threatens to enter my position after all but via the e-file. Covering that with the rook won't be an option because of Nf5+/ 
258,9,24,3Nf4,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp3p1/P1Pr1n2/2KN4/3R1P1P/8 w - -',This will lead to a draw after exchanging the pieces but it doesn't seem like black can do much better given the threat of Re2
259,9,25,3Nxf4,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp3p1/P1Pr1N2/2K5/3R1P1P/8 b - -',trading here also seems best for white as trying to get to e1 via Rd1 will also lead to exchanging the pieces and at least now black willhave to deal with some pawn weaknesses.
260,9,26,3Kd3,b'8/p7/1p1k3p/1Pp5/P1P2p2/3K4/5P1P/8 b - -',And a draw is agreed upon. Black will play Ke5 and after 40. f3 black's king is bound to e5 and f5 in order to keep the white king away from e4 while white can't really go for an adventure on the king side either because that would allow the black king access to d4
261,10,0,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Up to this point we have been playing a reasonably normal dutch defense opening although I found it is rather uncommon that white does not fianchetto on g2 developing the bishop on d3 is by no means bad. I play c6 here to reinforce control of d5 but since e7 is often a weakness in the Dutch defense it may have been better to prioritize on preparing for e5
262,10,1,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',white opens up the game to be able to put pressure on the e-file.
263,10,2,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2p2np1/3p4/2PPN3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',chases the knight away from its active square but has the downside of make the situation of the e-pawn even more problematic.
264,10,3,Bxf3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2p1bp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP4/2NB1b1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',While I don't really like making two moves with the bishop just to trade it there seem to be no better squares for it to go. In addition the queen is not fully comfortable on f3 since the f-file is half open so there is not a real tempo gain for white here.
265,10,4,1Qe6+,b'r2qr1k1/pp1np1bp/2p1Qnp1/3p4/2PP4/2NB3P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',black was finally ready for the pawn thrust so this was an excellent way to postpone it even further and keep the black position cramped up.
266,10,5,Nf8,b'r2qrn1k/pp2p1bp/2p1Qnp1/3P4/3P4/2NB3P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',pointing an extra attack at the d5 pawn while gaining a tempo.
267,10,6,Nxd5,b'r2qrn1k/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3n4/3P4/2NB3P/PP2QPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',taking like this hits the d-pawn. This forces white's hand which means black will finally have time to take care of his e-pawn.
268,10,7,Nxc3,b'r2qrn1k/pp4bp/2p3p1/4P3/8/2nBB2P/PP2QPP1/R4RK1 w - -',This trade weakens white's pawn structure but does leave him with a bishop pair. Perhaps trading on e3 would have been better to leave the dark-squared bishop uncontested. While white's light-squared bishop will also be uncontested if the dark-squared bishops were to trade with each other black has a wide open king.
269,10,8,Qc7,b'r3r2k/ppq4p/2p1n1p1/4b3/8/2PBB2P/P3QPP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Evaluating the powition from here no plan becomes immediately apparent to me. Maybe white should play for creating strong squares for his knights by pushing the c-pawn? In the meantime white might want to get the black bishop off the board but at this point I am not too sure any more that this will lead to a deadly attack.
270,10,9,Nf4,b'r3r2k/ppq4p/2p3p1/4b3/5n2/2PBB2P/P1Q2PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',In the game I adopted the rather weak plan of trying to chase the light bishop trade with it and try to ride the slightly better pawn structure to victory. As a result the game is not really going anywhere for a while.
271,10,10,Rad8,b'3rr2k/ppq4p/2p3p1/4b3/2B2n2/2P1B2P/P1Q2PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',making sure not to leave the d-file uncontested.

273,10,12,Qc7,b'3r3k/ppq4p/2p3p1/3nb3/P7/2P4P/2QB1PP1/2R2BK1 w - -',MOving out of the battery returning the queen without it having had any real effect.
274,10,13,Qg7,b'3r3k/pp4qp/2p3p1/4b3/P1P2n2/2B4P/2Q2PP1/2R2BK1 w - -',Somewhat forcing the trade since if black gets to trade now his rook can enter white's position threateningly on d1
275,10,14,Re8,b'4r2k/pp5p/2p3p1/4q3/P1P2n2/7P/2Q2PP1/3R1BK1 w - -',Keeping the rooks on the board means black doesn't have to retreat immediately to defend d8
276,10,15,3Qd2,b'4r2k/pp5p/2p3p1/4q3/P1P2n2/7P/3Q1PP1/3R1BK1 b - -',Rd7 seems a little stronger to me as it forces black to play Re7 allowing white to trade and be the first to make an active queen move in the very open position where initiative can be of utmost importance.
277,10,16,3Kg7,b'4r3/pp4kp/2p3p1/4q3/P1P2n2/7P/3Q1PP1/3R1BK1 w - -',giving the king a head start for the end game.
278,10,17,Rf8,b'5r2/pp4kp/2p3p1/8/P1PR1n2/7P/5PP1/5BK1 w - -',defending the knight and giving me the option to defend the seventh row.
279,10,18,3f3,b'8/pp3k1p/2p3p1/8/P1P2n2/5P1P/6P1/5BK1 b - -',opening a lane for the king
280,10,19,Ne6,b'8/pp5p/2p1n1p1/4k3/P1P5/4KP1P/6P1/5B2 w - -',played around to c5 but since the knight was keeping the bishop at bay as a guardian of g2 it would probably have been better to reposition the pawns on the king side on dark squares so they can't be attacked by the white bishop. 39...g5 has an additional benefit of preventing f4
281,10,20,Nd7,b'8/pp1n3p/2p3p1/4k3/P1P5/4KP1P/2B3P1/8 w - -',Very passively played but since the KS pawns are now locked in position because they are on light squares there needs to come some sort of support.
282,10,21,Kd6,b'8/pp1n3p/2pk2p1/8/P1P2P2/4K2P/2B3P1/8 w - -',Probably the wrong direction to go. At f6 the king could support g6 which would make those pawns mobile. The white king kan easily block d4 so black can only dream of going to c5 and black has the knight to prevent white from advancing too far with his king himself.
283,10,22,Nf6,b'8/pp5p/3k1np1/2p5/P1P2P2/2K4P/2B3P1/8 w - -',Nf8 may have worked a bit better though it sounds strange by virtue of allowing h6. Of course if white responds with h4 preventing g5 from black black still needs to bring his king to the KS to support g5 but since white can't really progress his king regardless this plan may actually be fine.
284,10,23,Kf7,b'8/pp3k1p/5np1/2p5/P1P2PP1/7P/2BK4/8 w - -',This plan to support g6 is once again too backwards. If anything the king should be on f6. The knight has time to regroup via e8 to d6 before white can get his king to e4 in time. An additional disadvantage of f7 is that it is on a light diagonal together with one of white's weak pawns which certainly ends up mattering.
285,10,24,4g5,b'8/pp3k2/5npp/2p3P1/P1P2P2/4K2P/2B5/8 b - -',Now black is in trouble since he has been playing backwards for a while and now runs into the problem that he has to give up control over e4 which means white can get his king to a rather dangerous position.
286,10,25,5a5,b'8/pp3k2/1n4p1/P1p3P1/2P2K2/7P/2B5/8 b - -',Now we see the disadvantage of the king being on a light diagonal together with the pawn that black would like to pressure: since Nxc4 gets punished by Bb3 winning the knight the fork on both of white's pawns doesn't work at all!
287,10,26,5Bc2,b'8/pp6/4k1p1/P1p1n1P1/2P2K1P/8/2B5/8 b - -',White can of course still not take on c4 and white now pressures the weak g6 again as well.
288,10,27,5Kd6,b'8/pp6/3k2p1/P1p1n1P1/2P2K1P/8/2B5/8 w - -',Trying to move out of the dangerous diagonal to bind the white bishop to c4 on b3 but it is much too late.
289,10,28,5h5,b'8/pp6/3k2p1/P1p1n1PP/2P2K2/8/2B5/8 b - -',the resulting pawn will be very hard to fight for black.
290,10,29,Nxg6+,b'8/pp6/3k2n1/P1p4p/2P2K2/8/2B5/8 w - -',Black could instead have tried to go for 56....Nc6 57. g7 Ne7 but after that 58. Bh7 is still going to force the exchange of pawn for knight and win that way.
291,10,30,h3,b'8/p7/Pp1k4/2p5/2P1BK2/7p/8/8 w - -',Thinking that luring away the king and traveling to e5-d4-c3-b4-a5 with my own king might give me a shot. 
292,10,31,6Bc6,b'8/p7/PpB5/2p1k3/2P5/6Kp/8/8 b - -',HOwever instead of allowing himself to be chased away from d3 white makes the much better move of settling in on b5 with his bishop where he can stand forever and c4 and a6 will be defended forever.
293,10,32,Kc7,b'8/p1k5/Pp6/1Bp5/2P5/6Kp/8/8 w - -',Here I somehow get illusions of a stalemate or refusal to let myself get chased out of the corner but of course....

Not seeing that the blockade on b6 would obviously be lifted dragged the game out 15 moves after it was actually over.
295,11,0,Be2,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White avoids too complicated play by forcing the trade of the bishops early on and giving up the pawn leading to a dynamic game where both players get to develop freely
296,11,1,O-O-O,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/3P4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',Opting against 7.... Nxd4 8. Nxd4 Qxd4 9.Rd1. While I would be a pawn ahead my long castle is cut off and I felt that I would rather simply develop than greadily grabbing a pawn and defend against white's rapidly developing pieces.
297,11,2,e6,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/4BN2/PPP1QPPP/RN3RK1 w - -',More agression with e5 seems interesting as well although it does allow white to take a jab at a7 via 9. xe5 Nxe5 10. Bxa7.
298,11,3,1c5,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/2P4q/3P4/2N1BN2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Chases away the bishop from what looks like its optimal square but also severely weakens the pawn on d4 which is now hanging.
299,11,4,e5,b'2kr3r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2P1p2q/1P1P4/2N1BN2/P3QPPP/R4RK1 w - -',In hindsight I really don't know what I was thinking here. Not only does this straight up lose a pawn since one of the defenders can be traded off but even without that being the case I solve white's main weakness for him. Setting up the rooks to be doubled via 13...Nd5 14. Nxd5 Rxd5 seems better.

(I do want to note that as White I've been opening with g3 almost exclusively but after studying a lot of games I've now gone back to e4 though my hope most of the time is to develop into a Kings Indian or variation there of.)

Nc3 Nf3 or even c4 would probably be a much better response here. I'll sometimes play h4 if I fianchetto king side (usually in a KIA) but thats usually much later in the opening. I'm really not sure what he was trying to do here. Maybe nf3 ng5 attacking the f7 square? I played d7 defending the center and allowing for development into either a Kings Indian Fianchetto Variation or maybe a Sicillian Dragon. To be honest I play the position I try not to pay too much attention to the openings names. I am citing them here simply because it may help others look into what I'm playing here.

I castled and at this point he resigned. I enjoy looking over this game not because it was a big win (in material) but because it shows that staying really basic in your moves and trying to stick to sound principles can deliver big defeats. Look at the difference in pawn structures here...

640,22,0,b3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The Larsen's Opening. I think this was the second time I ever played vs this opening which is kinda odd considering it's the 6th most popular opening move. Larsen himself thought that b3 is an opening in which most black players make a mistake somewhere since they aren't familiar with the ideas behind the opening. He was more or less right I didn't know and still don't know these ideas hence why I'm analysing this game in the first place. I expected her to play the London system and prepared for that specific opening the night before so I was a little bit baffled about b3 which invites a completely different kind of position.

643,22,3,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq -',Unfamiliar with the opening I was calculating d4 here but couldn't see how that'd benefit white so I disregarded it. I should have thought a little longer about this move even if it's just to familiarize myself with the ideas of the opening.
644,22,4,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq d6',Taking a hold of the center.

Usually a move like Bd7 would work fine however because his bishop on b2 is attacking e5 the only really thing black can do is to defend e5. White usually tries to hold onto this pin for a little while however I researched my opponent a little bit before the match and knew she had a tendency to just take in these type of positions.

646,22,6,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',"Theory suggests that 4.Bb5 Bd6 5.c4 is the logical continuation after 4. Bb5. I opt for f6 instead. This move may look insignificant but means a huge deal since it closes off a diagonal for my queen and makes Nf6 impossible for the time being. Also interesting to note is that after d4 all my pawns would be positioned on dark squares which weakens his bishop on b2 but makes it hard for my own dark squared bishop to develop properly. This last part will become a huge issue later on.

647,22,7,bxc6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/2p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',As predicted she couldn't resist taking. Black has a frightening center now and ideas arise along the lines of Rb1 -> Rb4  and then bringing it over to the king side. That idea of course isn't useful just yet but it's definitely there. I think black is better here and if black develops normally from this point onwards he'll have a very good game.
648,22,8,Ne2,b'r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/2p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Developing a knight to a rather poor square. Nf3 isn't really an option though since 6. Nf3 e4 makes white's position a tad cramped.
649,22,9,Ba6,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b1p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',this move took me quite long and quite frankly I think Bf5 is better targeting the weak c2 square. Looking back at it I'm not sure why that wasn't played. I assumed she was going to castle king-side which is premature in my opinion.
650,22,10,O-O,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b1p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',She did end up castling which I think is an error. Now the knight on e2 is in a spot where it can't move to g3.
651,22,11,c5,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2ppp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',"This move and the following ones are the reason why I'm not too proud of this game. The idea behind c5 can be explained with 3 short sentences.: I have doubled pawns. I don't like double pawns. can we get rid of them?
I figured I'd push with d4 and get in a position where white is cramped and struggling to develop her minor pieces.  This however makes things awkward for my dark squared bishop. I wonder what I would play if I could replay this game probably something like Bc5 or Nd7."
652,22,12,d3,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP3/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Making room for the knight to develop to d2. I understand this move but it feels sort of tame. I probably would have played f4 if I were in white's shoes. After 8. exf4 Rxf4 9. Bd6 Rf2 white gets out of the pin and can create some sort of counter play. She'll still have a very tough game but it offers better chances in my opinion than 8. d3. If black doesn't take on f4 then after for example 8. f4 Ne7 9. fxe5 fxe5 10. d3 white has a pretty solid position with an open f-file. In that position black would probably still be better but white would barely have any big weaknesses which black can exploit whereas black's position is aggressive but vulnerable on e5 c5c7  the e8-h5 diagonal etc.
653,22,13,d4,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2p1p3/3p4/1P1PP3/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',You can probably tell by now that my dark squared bishop isn't going to play a huge role in the next few moves. At this point I started calculating f4. My opponent afterwards asked me what move she should have played and when I explained her my f4 idea she admitted to not noticing that idea. f4 is going to play a major role in all my future calculations.
654,22,14,cxd4,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/3p4/1P1P4/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black has more space but f4 is a serious issue and black's white squared bishop is looking rather odd. I start to get a little nervous at this point but decide to not show a worried face to my opponent. Instead I leave the room to tempt her to make her move more quickly. You often see lower rated players do this to win a couple of minutes. Up until this point I had spend about 20-25 minutes whereas she had used 15 minutes. By leaving my board I essentially tempt her in getting a 15 minute advantage in the hope that she doesn't think of f4.
655,22,15,1c3,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/3p4/1PPP4/PB2NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',When I came back 5 minutes later I noticed 4 more minutes missing on my clock and c3 being played. I took a sip of my drink ( Which I ended up getting in the time I left my board ) and leisurely looked at the board. My worst nightmare f4 wasn't played and it looked like I was going to get a pawn for free. Life was good.
656,22,16,1dxc3,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PpP4/PB2NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Losing a bit of my pressure but making a move like f4 less uncomfortable. White also can't prevent black from winning material. She sighed as she realised she messed up. The following move strangely enough took her 5 minutes or so. After the game she told me that she was unsure of which piece she'd recapture with.
657,22,17,1Nbxc3,b'r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PNP4/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The most logical recapture in my opinion. Notice how her minor pieces are developed whereas most of my pieces are still on the 8th rank.
658,22,18,1Qxd3,b'r3kbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PNq4/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Bxd3 was the other option. Both are fine in my opinion. I opted for a queen trade since I was 1 pawn ahead. It may seem like a premature decision but surely I should be able to win an endgame against a usually weaker opposition right?
659,22,19,1Rae1,b'r3kbnr/p1p3pp/5p2/4p3/8/1PNb4/PB2NPPP/4RRK1 b kq -',"This move just straight up loses. She should have played Rf1e1 or Rf1d1 in my opinion. This just makes the position very awkward for white. The knight can't move the open files aren't used etc. 

Editing note: Looking back at this game once more my assesment of the position before this move is that black is up but not by much. The reason being because he's underdevelopped and one could argue that it's worth the pawn. In this position ideas of f4 arise once more. White should aim to open up the game and gives checks all across the board rather then bunker up. Rae1 is a mistake and instead Rfd1 or Rad1 should have been played after which I continue Rd8 or O-O-O. Maybe then Ng3 or f4 or something but the move that was played."
660,22,20,1Bc5,b'r3k1nr/p1p3pp/5p2/2b1p3/8/1PNb4/PB2NPPP/4RRK1 w kq -',This move is to prevent f4 once more. reason being that the rook on e1 makes f4 an even bigger nuisance. Let's say that I make a random move like h6. 13. Rae1 h6 14. f4 exf5 and white has 2 rooks aiming at the king and 2 knights ready to give checks everywhere. Black should move cautious because there's definite attacking chances for white in that position.  Or 13. Rae1 h6 14. f4 Rd1 15. fxe5 fxe5 16. with the same issues. White can probably spare a tempo in that position to get out of the pin and will start aiming with all his pieces towards my king. The pawn on e5 would most likely fall somewhere along the line and one could even go as far as saying white is better in that position. Of course that is implying that I lose 1 or more tempo by making unnecessary moves but you get the idea. The threat is definitely there in the future.
661,22,21,1Nd5,b'r3k1nr/p1p3pp/5p2/2bNp3/8/1P1b4/PB2NPPP/4RRK1 b kq -',Aiming at c7 which forks king and rook. This would probably work in a blitz game but with still more then an hour on the clock? Not likely.
662,22,22,1Bb6,b'r3k1nr/p1p3pp/1b3p2/3Np3/8/1P1b4/PB2NPPP/4RRK1 w kq -',Rc8 might have been slightly better since now white can get out of the pin by taking the bishop and employ the f4 idea.
663,22,23,1Kh1,b'r3k1nr/p1p3pp/1b3p2/3Np3/8/1P1b4/PB2NPPP/4RR1K b kq -',This is where she noticed the f4 idea. A tad late but at least she noticed. The next move is going to take me a while.
664,22,24,1Kf7,b'r5nr/p1p2kpp/1b3p2/3Np3/8/1P1b4/PB2NPPP/4RR1K w - -',I'm tired of having to calculate f4 every move so I decide to get out of the pin. f4 is still playable but my knight ( which hasn't moved all game the poor thing ) defends the important e7 square thus making an attack rather unlikely to succeed.
665,22,25,1a4,b'r5nr/p1p2kpp/1b3p2/3Np3/P7/1P1b4/1B2NPPP/4RR1K b - a3',Not too sure what she's trying here. If I had to take a guess she's grasping at straws here to try and create some kind of counterplay before she unleashes f4 maybe hoping I'll develop my knight so the e7 square isn't protected anymore.

Ne7 is slightly better than Nh6 in my opinion because although both moves move towards the d4 square after Ne7 -> Nc6 white can't play b4. b4 isn't a big threat per sé but I'm the type of player that likes to kill all counter play before finishing off a game.

682,22,42,Nxf1+,b'4r3/p4kpp/1p3p2/8/1P3p2/7P/6PK/2B2n2 w - -',She resigned. All in all I ended up winning and the chess team I play in even ended up winning its first team victory ( with a score of 3-1) of the season. That being said this game was full with inaccuracies. If white had played f4 sooner then black would have had a hard game for sure. I also don't like that I wasn't able to exploit her weaknesses though that in itself is interesting to analyse. 2 weeks ago I won versus a 1600 elo player this week I struggled against someone easily 400-500 points weaker. It not only proves that I still got a long way to go but perhaps also emphasizes one of the best parts about chess the part in which it's a game and no outcome is certain.

I would be forced to play BxN (to avoid threats on c2 and d3) and with axN black would have opened the column for his R which I don't like.

This way black hasn't solved his developement problems yet. Of course I want to avoid d4 and if Ne4 I will exchange if needed closing the white diagonal with f3.

From this square the WN can go to d4 threatening e6 which would be a good way of further tie down black.

801,26,20,1Qd2,b'r3kb1r/pp4pp/1q2p1b1/3pB3/6PP/2P5/PP1Q1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Qb3 was possible but if black wants to exchange the game becomes very boring. Of couse this move has the counterside of releasing the dsb's trap (since f3 is not supported anymore). To preserve this Qe2 was preferable (with Qb5 as a resource to ensure the Q's exchange if any danger arises). But it would have blinded my lsb. I will allow black's lsb to dare to go to e4 in order to have a free way to g5 or f4 pressing g7. I can't say this is better or worse. 
802,26,21,1Rh3,b'r3kb1r/pp4pp/1q2p3/3pB3/4b1PP/2P4R/PP1Q1P2/R3KB2 b Qkq -',This was the move I had in mind when allowing the B to take such a good outpost. Now my trap will work (black will not lose it of course it will end with the B on f7 which is the place where it could and probably should have gone for a solid game. Unless I play g5 first).

I don't want to play gxh because it allows Bf5 threatening my R (and making my trap useless) nor g5 which blocks my hoped Qg5 move. 
804,26,23,1Be2,b'r3kb1r/pp4p1/1q2p3/3pB2p/4b1PP/2P4R/PP1QBP2/R3K3 b Qkq -',...this does preserve the trap because if hxg Bxg4 and then black has one move to prevent f3 (Bf5 BxB e6xB and Qxd5 will be very strong for white). Black will have to retreat his B to g6 which again is not deadly bad but after Qg5 the B has to be defended again.

Black aims to setup a flexible defensive structure with bishops on e7 and e6 knights on d7 and f6 and Queen on c7 with rooks on c8 and d8.

If the knight moves to h5 I will have to do quite some maneuvering to get it out of the way (probably via Be2 and f4 both of which block easy access of my queen and dark-squared bishop to the king side). for the pawn storm it would be necessary to get a pawn to h5 anyway so maybe I should try to do that first before playing g5.

On h5 the knight would have been a better defender if black wants to castle short as he can retreat it to g7. Here it is obstructing the light-squared bishop and making the position quite cramped.

Of course the black king can't castle long any more but with the g- and h-file not being as safe as they may seem it may have been better to keep the king in the middle at least until some pieces are forced off the board through an attack on white's position.

Blocking that advance means I can play h6 on the next move in order to open up at least one of the king-side files leading to a strong attack.

863,29,1,Nxd5,b'r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Probably incorrect. White now gets to grab some space by playing c4. Better may have been to play Nb6 first which covers c4 and also might allow to take with the queen instead.

A rather strange move. taking on e3 wins back a piece and while white still has an uncomfortably placed king black's attack will likely not pull through completely without the extra knight which means black will eventually have to make some sort of retreating move with his rook handing back the initiative to white. It still doesn't look great but certainly better than being several pieces down.

Kf2 actually creates a rather dangerous situation for black as I will look to play f6 on the next turn winning the g-pawn and creating a passed pawn that is quite far advanced. Black will still have a lot of play in that position but I feel like I may have had a bit more chances in that line than the cautious one I took.

Instead h4 seems like a reasonable option looking to play h5 next which creates some opportunities for my pawns on the king side to become dangerous.

903,30,20,Ra5,b'1k6/p1p5/1p1r1Pp1/r6p/7P/4K1P1/8/5Q2 w - -',excellent move that I had not considered. 35. f7 is now prevented as black will play 35...Re5 forcing the king to the f-file which means the queen is lost.
904,30,21,3Ke4,b'1k6/p1p5/1p1r1Pp1/r6p/4K2P/6P1/8/5Q2 b - -',preventing the nightmare scenario described above but now black has enough time to pick up the pawn.
905,30,22,3Re6+,b'1k6/p1p5/1p2rPp1/r6p/4K2P/6P1/8/5Q2 w - -',This move even removes the option of a desperado 35....Rf5 36. Qxf5 xf5 37. Kxf5 which might give white some sort of chance to promote a pawn.
906,30,23,4Kd4,b'8/1kp5/1p4p1/p1r2r1p/3K3P/1Q4P1/8/8 b - -',Most of white's moves already didn't really have a clear plan behind them any more and mostly played to some sort of misstep that would allow to pick up a pawn or something like that but now the curtain definitely falls.
907,30,24,c5+,b'8/1k6/1p4p1/p1p1rr1p/3K3P/1Q4P1/8/8 w - c6',Forcing the king on the same row as the queen to play Rf3 for the win and therefore prompting the concession.

911,31,3,Qf4,b'r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/6B1/2BNPQ2/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b - -',profilaxis against Ne5. It doesn't prevent the move but it does prevent it from being an annoying fork.
912,31,4,1Qe3,b'r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/6Bn/2BNP3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',I wanted to develop my other knight via d2 so I avoided Qd2 here but as we will see later this is not really the most convenient square either since black will be able to place a knight on g4 with a tempo gain later on.
913,31,5,Ng4,b'r1b1qrk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/6Bn/3NP1n1/1B2Q3/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',As mentioned earlier the ill-positioned queen allows black to make this move à tempo and it leads to a powerful sequence winning a pawn

Black's favourite move to develop his bishop (seen next move) would for example not be possible in that case

919,31,11,2e5,b'r4rk1/ppp2pbp/2qp2p1/4P1Bn/8/1P1Q1N1P/2P2PP1/3RR1K1 b - -',opening up the centre would be favourable as I have already positioned my rooks along the centre files.

This still loses a pawn through 23...Bxe4 24. xh5 xh5 but at least in that position black has a bunch of weak pawns rather than a pawns on f3 preventing my king to move out in the end game.

924,31,16,2hxg6,b'3B2k1/pp3pbp/2p3P1/8/8/1P3p1P/2P2P2/6K1 b - -',Seems a bit inaccurate in hindsight. If I allow black to take his pawn structure is ruined so I am likely to get the pawn back anyways and in this way I allow black to create a fast lane for his king.
925,31,17,2fxg6,b'3B2k1/pp4bp/2p3p1/8/8/1P3p1P/2P2P2/6K1 w - -',Opens up a quick route for the king to rush forward.

931,31,23,Ke4,b'8/1p5p/pBp3p1/4b3/4k3/1P3p1P/2PK1P2/8 w - -',With the black king this far advanced and two pawns down there really is no hope any more since the pawns on the king side should easily overwhelm me. I rather pointlessly played some more moves.
932,31,24,h5,b'8/8/2p2b2/1pB3pp/1P2k3/5p1P/3K1P2/8 w - h6',And a concession. Black can free up his h-pawn then block the b8-h2 diagonal with a bishop on e5 and happily march to h1.
933,32,0,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',I guess this is called the Benko opening (g3 that is). I had studied a few of gnitnaws games before I joined his game. I saw he favored queens pawn games (as white he seemed to prefer a queens gambit game) and as black he favored variations that began with d5.

Black I'm assuming is going for a french defense here. 

I generally aim for a quick king side castle in most games.  "

At the time I started this game I hadn't been playing g3 openings long. I've really just begun exploring the king side fianchetto. Now I prefer to begin with e4 though my general goal is to fianchetto king side. I'm a big fan of the Kings Indian Attack. 
937,32,4,Bd6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nbpn1p/3p4/3P1B2/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',I moved my bishop to f4 here for two reasons. I wanted some extra protection in case of a pawn push to e5 and at this point I was planning to bring my Knight to that e5 square. I like to open up the c6 square against my opponents. That gives me a line at the King. Also I wanted to put some pressure on the f7 square.

Like I said in the beginning I had studied a few of gnitnaws games before I joined. c5 was expected and a common patterns in his games. As I said I saw how he favored the queens gambit games. It was at this point I noticed if I could get him off of the d5 square I'd have a shot at his rook on a8...

1095,37,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Playing this I was praying that the opponent wouldn't transpose into the benoni with c5. Not that the benoni is impossible to beat but it starts off things far more quickly then I'd like and it has quite a lot of theory.
1096,37,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The King's Indian Defence black commits himself with this move to a hypermodern defence. Can't say I face it too often but it's a viable option for black. Here I was expecting him to transpose into the grünfeld defence. Not sure why he just seemed like the sort of guy who'd play the grünfeld.
1097,37,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Developing a knight more common is Nc3 but this works too.

1099,37,6,Bg5,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',For whatever reason I was expecting e6 but black is perfectly fine delaying e6 or perhaps not even playing it at all. Bf4 was also an idea and perhaps slightly better. That being said it's not too bad.
1100,37,7,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Defending the pawn it blocks off the knight of the natural square c6 but openings like the slav have proven time in time again that this isn't really a problem. He'll develop it via Nd7.
1101,37,8,cxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3P2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',Looking back at it I'm not sure why I traded. Probably to try and simplify the position a bit and in the future take a stab at b7 and d5 with Qb3. That idea still needs A LOT of work but you never know in these type of elo's.
1102,37,9,Nxd5,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',I think recapturing with the pawn would have been better since now I have e4 with tempo. His knight doesn't have a good square except f6 so either he trades with my knight or he moves back to f6. This is more or less handing me the center.
1103,37,10,e4,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n2B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq e3',What's it gonna be?

1105,37,12,Qa5,b'rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q5B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',A good move which immediately complicates things due to his bishop attacking the a1-h8 file. It also indirectly puts pressure on my previously good bishop which now doesn't look quite as amazing anymore.
1106,37,13,Qd2,b'rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q5B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',This move took me a few minutes since I was considering moving my bishop to d2 and then following up with something along the lines of c4. I figured that might be a bit too ambitious this defends the c-file and protects the a2 pawn so my rook can maybe target down the b-file or support the center in the near future. This comes at the cost of my bishop being unable to go back to c1 or d2 and maybe target the other side of the board but considering his queen is there I highly doubt that'd be a good idea anyway. If he chases my bishop with pawns I'll respond with Bf4 -> Bg3.
1107,37,14,c5,b'rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1p3B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',dxc5 or d5 aren't options since Bxc3 means game over. This move took me a few minutes to find as well.

Both ideas are unappealing since e5 indirectly blocks the a1-h8 diagonal and trading literally destroys the last bit of development he had. The plan in which he trades his bishop makes me lose my right to castle after 2 or 3 moves but I doubt black will be able to take advantage of that since he'll be underdeveloped and have no pressure on the center.
1109,37,16,1Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/q1p3B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',Developing and putting more pressure. Sadly for him the c3 issue is solved so I can put some pressure on it.
1110,37,17,Ne5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1pPn1B1/4P3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',"We have a saying over here which would roughly translate to the following. ""When you say A you got to say B."" The diagonal is obstructed once more. That being said that knight isn't going to be there for long."

I dislike this type of aggressive play and it blocks off a route for my bishop but it gets me a tempo and if I get e5 of at the right timing then black can more or less resign. A plan like Bc4 -> Bb3 -> O-O doesn't' look too unappealing albeit a bit slow.
1114,37,21,1Bg7,b'r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1pP2B1/4PP2/2P5/P2Q2PP/2R1KB1R w Kkq -',Retreating to the other diagonal offers future to the bishop but it'd take a few moves. Moves which the opponent doesn't really have time for anymore.

I'd rather not give him even the slightest bit of counter play. The plan was to put the bishop on f3 if things do end up going at a slower pace and then targeting down that diagonal after an e5 push. Maybe eventually create a discovered attack."
1116,37,23,1Bd7,b'r3k2r/pp1bppbp/6p1/q1pP2B1/4PP2/2P5/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R w Kkq -',He finally gets the chance to develop this thing though it doesn't really contribute a lot just quite yet. At the very least he's closer to connecting the rooks now so that they can coöperate to try and stop this mayhem.
1117,37,24,1c4,b'r3k2r/pp1bppbp/6p1/q1pP2B1/2P1PP2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R b Kkq -',Solidifying the position. I felt like I didn't really need castling anymore as long as moving my king connects the rooks. Maybe it's not the best idea to trade off a queen which has such a huge role in my attack but I felt like I'd be alright. b5 is a slight concern in the distant future but if that were to happen trading gives my rook on c1 a semi-open file and his pawn on c5 will become troublesome to defend.
1118,37,25,1Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppqbppbp/6p1/2pP2B1/2P1PP2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R w Kkq -',This is the first move on which he thought longer then 5 minutes. I had used about 45 minutes compared to his 25 minutes. He probably felt like he wouldn't be able to hang on without his queen. I'm about to do something stupid though.
1119,37,26,1Bxe7,b'r3k2r/ppqbBpbp/6p1/2pP4/2P1PP2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R b Kkq -',Optimistic in my dominant position I thought he couldn't take my bishop since d6 follows. Right after I hit the clock my heart dropped. I started stressing whereas he started nodding his head as if he had just seen a gift granted to him by the gods themselves. Turns out it isn't quite that easy though.
1120,37,27,1Kxe7,b'r6r/ppqbkpbp/6p1/2pP4/2P1PP2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R w K -',I was about to resign here when it suddenly hits me that this really isn't as easy for black as you'd think. d6 isn't possible quite yet but the threat still exists. So e5  makes that threat a reality. A reality he must respond to and just about none of the obvious responses are easy to play.
1121,37,28,1e5,b'r6r/ppqbkpbp/6p1/2pPP3/2P2P2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R b K -',"I threaten d6. Moving his king away is the first instinct a lot of players have but it leads to a difficult game. Example: 17 e5 Kd8 18. e6 Qc8. Essentially the problem for black is that activating his queen won't be easy anymore. You could do it via 18. ... Qc6 19.Bf3 Qa4. But then the queen won't be there to help defend anything. White has threats such as f5 which  you can't really stop. It leads to Qg5 check and eventually possibly to checkmate.

The only way to prevent Qg5 is h6 or Qd7 ( implying you haven't moved her to a4 like previously explained ) but that gets met by f6. Eventually I'll force my way into e6 and both sides have a long game with long calculations ahead of them. This all took me a while to calculate but I suddenly found a glimmer of hope. If black messes up even once he's done for."
1122,37,29,1Bxe5,b'r6r/ppqbkp1p/6p1/2pPb3/2P2P2/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R w K -',My opponent's smile became bleaker and bleaker as time passed by when he came up with this move. This move took him 15 minutes of thinking and marked the first time he had less time then me on the clock. I guess he calculated just how difficult the game would be if he were to move his king or queen so he avoids it entirely by offering back the material. It stops my previously impressive attack right in its tracks. I gotta give props to black here sure I screwed up but technically speaking he did stop my pawnstorm.
1123,37,30,Qxe5,b'r6r/pp1bkp1p/6p1/2pPq3/2P5/8/P2QB1PP/2R1K2R w K -',Black is a pawn up but white has a passed d pawn. I'm kind of bummed out since my attack of earlier got nullified but unlike those superGM's we tend to screw up. This game isn't over just yet.

Or moving his queen away to avoid the shenanigans. Note added later on: For those interested I looked at what would have happened if Qxa2 would have been played. Qxa2 loses for black in every single combination except for 1 in which it draws due to repetition. Reason being because after I force his king all the way back to f8 I'm able to just capture his bishop. It's still a rocky road from there but black was correct not to take it.

1131,37,38,2Qd4,b'7r/pp1b1p1p/3k2p1/2pP4/2Pq4/4Q3/P5PP/3B1RK1 w - -',Black wants to trade pieces since he's ahead. This move accomplishes that since it's forced. If the pawn were to get on d4 then moving his king to c5 will became rather difficult to defend against.

I kind of felt bad for the poor guy since he's gonna lose the d4 pawn due to this. Recapturing on e8 means his king will be too far away to protect d4.

The only way he'd get to the d4 square in 3 moves is via Kd7 -> Kd6 -> Kc5 and if I were to play c5 as soon as he does that he can't reach c5 anymore meaning he'd have to walk all the way around to e5. b6 stops the c5 idea but it's too late for the pawn on d4.
1139,37,46,a6,b'8/7p/pp1k2p1/3P4/2PK4/8/P5PP/8 w - -',Black can resign here. White can just block all the pawns and start pushing his d pawn. If for whatever reason white needs to give black a tempo in 10 or so moves he can do this by what I believe is called triangulation which forces a zugzwang. Something I studied in the past. Therefore black is hopelessly lost. He continues playing just to see if I were to screw up. The next moves which should be so obvious are gonna take him 45 minutes of thinking. Does he hope I screw up or does he actually not realise black can't win here if played correctly?

With this win I end my opponent's 17 win-streak so he's probably higher rated then 1590 as soon as the elo updates at the end of the season. In this game I played in a style which was not like what I'm used to namely I took a more aggressive approach. That being said I'm interested to see what would have happened had he accepted the bishop without giving back material. My chessteam did end up losing overall which wasn't unexpected. It's what usually happens when the opponents weakest player is stronger then our strongest player. Board 3 lost after just 15 minutes due to insufficent openingpreparation and board 2 simply was outmatched. Seeing how I was winning board 1 got offered a draw since they wanted to secure the overall win. They are 1 out of 2 teams battling it out for promotion and having a tie with us would destroy that possiblity. Considering our board 1 player was slightly behind ( even material but he had more exploitable weaknesses ) he accepted without second thought.

1226,39,0,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',The white's second choice normally made by opponents who want to avoid the tactics of the other responses (like Icelandic gambit) and tends to an interesting but somewhat predictable game. In which black is who has the advantage if white's game is suboptimal. 
1227,39,1,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',IMO this move has to be done. I don't now (now I want to learn :-P) how to play this with e3 blocking my own lsb. 
1228,39,2,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Here I am accepting that my lsb can be exchanged with some manouvering by white. This would be ok to me because as a payment for it in the meantime black starts his own plans on the queenside. 
1229,39,3,d4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',This seems natural: white doesn't want to block his own lsb with d3 and he wants to disclose his dsb's action a nomal and sound developement plan. c3 can still be played but also c4 (for some reason I don't see this move played very often). 
1230,39,4,a6,b'rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',If I play c5 at once (obviously both side's taget is to play the c pawn as strongly as possible) White has Bb5+. I can play it (both with Nc6 or c6 or Nd7) but it's a game I don't like so I sacrifice an important tempo so to stop that check. 
1231,39,5,Bg5,b'rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Natural aggressive move by white. The e5 outpost must be used. If I want to play f6 the game becomes wilde at once and I won't bet for Black then. The Q is not better placed on d7 (if I moved c6 or c4 instead of a6 the Q happily escapes on the black squares with threats on White). So I have to use a minor piece on e7 or I have to be prepared to face exf6 Nxf6 and the subsequent weaknes of e6 defended only by the lsb stucked in a vulnerable position (Nh4 and B has to choose whether to allow or not NxB e6xN...)
1232,39,6,Be7,b'rn1qk1nr/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',I decided to go for a not-so-complicated game and played this. If I use the Nd7 I have to be prepared to kick the dsb or to lose the chance for an inmediate c5. The problem is that if the dsb is exchanged I'll lose the proper support for c5 altogether...
1233,39,7,Bxe7,b'rn1qk1nr/1pp1Bppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',(White could have supported the B on g5 with Qd2)

I chess often you are forced to play your most aggressive plan just to avoid to be attacked too strongly. "
1235,39,9,c3,b'rn2k1nr/1pp1qppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',White wants to keep it quiet so he opts for this passive profilactic move. He spots that Qb4+ is threatened and the Q seems to be able to cause some troubles (the subsequent Qxb2 is double-edge since after Ng1 moves Rg1 attacks b7 but white was right to defend. White's move would be sound but for the fact that this way white deprives himself from c4. And this attacking move is to be on white's agenda as strongly as black put c5 as his target. 
1236,39,10,c5,b'rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq c6',It's true that the BQ delays black's Ng8 developement but hey it's so useful due to its action on both c6 and b4...
1237,39,11,Bd3,b'rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',Right. If black goes c4 white will exchange and he will open a hole on e6. I can play Nh6 (no lsb to threat it anymore) but I considered that the best use for this B was strangely to eliminate the Nf3. This will make d4 much more vulnerable and this is my target in this line. Nc6 will be a safe (due to a6) attacking developement. If I remove the Nf3 white will be forced to retake d4 with c3 and it will allow Qb4... 
1238,39,12,Bg4,b'rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P2b1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',Let's see white's reaction. It's normal to be glad of a BxN exchange and the BQ is not in position to land on b6 or h5 soon. But white wants to play his own Q on b3 or a5 and doesn't want black to leave the N at g2's defence so not to scramble his castling if BxN is played by Black. 
1239,39,13,Be2,b'rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P2b1/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This way the Q is free to go to b3 and anyway black could well have kicked it out with c4 on the next move.

1242,39,16,1O-O,b'r3k1nr/1p2qppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2B2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',"This seems to make Qb4+ harmless but Black got his ""hole"" on b4. And it still very important. "

1244,39,18,1Qb4,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1q1P4/5B2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',"Normally black's plan is Rc8 and Nb4 so to threat c2. But my dislodged Q is threatening d4 as well so this is a hard to meet fork on white's pawns. White may well think in ""emergency plans"" like Bxd5!? and if black takes with e6xd5 e6! will be very strong even if Black plays Nxd4 (Re1 is a good resource for white. And no matter if Qxb2 since after Ng-d2 Rg1 will revenge on b7. "
1245,39,19,1a3,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1q1P4/P4B2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White can't avoid Qxd4 and prefers to force it by kicking my Q into it so to exchange it returning to a quiet position. But in doing so omits...

1247,39,21,Qxd4,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3q4/P4B2/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',With this white is strategically won. 
1248,39,22,1Nb3,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3q4/PN3B2/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White still sees the Q's exchange as the solution but it is dead wrong. White could have tried Re1 - even if e5 is also a goner. 
1249,39,23,1Qxd1,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/8/PN3B2/5PPP/R2q1RK1 w kq -',My Q did a pretty good job and Nxe5 force W to move his lsb allowing me another tempo. 
1250,39,24,Nxe5,b'r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/8/PN3B2/5PPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',White resigns. The game could have gone on for many moves. White has Nc5 and Rc1/Rb1 to attack so it was not all lost by any means. But I hope that I gave some ideas behind this kind of game. Forgime for any mistake omission and feel free to give your view.
