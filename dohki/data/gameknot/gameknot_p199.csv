My opponent ended up with a trapped knight and I was able to build a strong attack with many threats one of which was overlooked.
79,3,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',stony and I have played a number of games with each of us pounding the other sometimes and each making mistakes though I take the cake on that one.  Here I had to get away from e4 sicilian ruy lop stuff and try to get him.  Reti seemed like a good choice.  KodiakJack got me thinking about it.

106,3,27,b3,b'2r5/7p/3k4/2p2R2/4KP2/1p2P3/7r/8 w - -',so he has a passed pawn and i have no hope to get to it.  both Ks stand well I'm in bad shape materially positionally and everything-ally.

Ten consecutive knight moves made by me in 13 out of the last 14 with the king move being to protect my queen's pawn but the knights are the fastest movers out of all the remaining pieces on the board and a three pawn haul in exchange for two of mine was very good for me: I can now finally make the most of my advantage.

If I move Rd1 to safety I'm certain that Freddy will exchange the N for B.  If I move Bh3 Black simply moves Qc6+ and Rd1 falls as it is en prise.  So I give up the exchange.  Besides I have another Rook.  How many rooks does one player need?

Sadly so far as I could discern Black never did and White's attack never developed.  I really enjoyed this game and my sincere thanks to freddy for including me in this tourney.  I look forward to any insight/comments you all may have.

215,7,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',This is a very interesting example of playing the Scandinavian for black and the typical strategies for white and black when white plays the quiet 5. Be2 line. I noticed my opponent played against the Scandinavian with great success in the gameknot mini-tournament on the same opening http://gameknot.com/mt.pl?id=41299 . His d3 system played in the tournament (and chosen for this game) is modest but solid and I thought it would be interesting to play against it. 
216,7,2,Qd6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/3q1n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Or ..Qa5. Here ..Qd6 is the more modern line
217,7,3,Be2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/3q1n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White looks to be playing the same quiet d3 system (by transposition)
218,7,4,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2pq1n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Black's system is modest. He plans (a)..c6 (b)..bishop c8 somewhere (c)..e6 (d)..Nbd7 (e)..Qc7 (f)..Bd6 and (g) ..O-O-O. Then depending on white's moves he can either play ..Nd5 ..Ne5 or the freeing ..e5.  Observe black's moves and you will see him singlemindedly following this development plan
219,7,5,Bf5,b'rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2pq1n2/5b2/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black wants to play against the d3 system this time (theory recommends d3 neutralising the f5 bishop). The idea for black to encourage d3 is that white generally plays d4 at some point to have an open game at which point the bishop is active again. Other moves like ..Bg4 are also possible but the effectiveness of ..Bg4 is already lessened through white's Be2 (so all the interesting variations like h3 Bh5 g4 Bg6 are not so strong after white plays d3). For an example of the ..Bg4 line against the Be2 Scandinavian see http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13108875   This is part (b) of his plan executed
220,7,6,Nbd7,b'r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2pq1n2/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Thematic. Part (d) of his plan

223,7,9,Qc7,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/8/2NPBN2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Necessary to deal with white's threat of Bf4 which he can now counter with ..Bd6. White can still execute his Bf4 plan supported by g2-g3 but this idea is usually a distraction for white that does not lead to advantage (especially here with his kingside castling). Part (e) of his plan
224,7,10,1Rad1,b'r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/8/2NPBN2/PPPQBPPP/3R1RK1 b kq -',Preparing d4

226,7,12,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/2NPBN1P/PPPQBPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',Black has completed his development and has equality. If white does nothing black plans ..Rhe8 ..e5 ..Nd5. The ..e5 move in particular will indicate a change in the energy of the game. This can allow black to play ..h6 retreat his light square bishop to ..e6 and after ..Nd5 he can even start a kingside attack with ..f5. The Scandinavian is very simple to play for black and he has a clear strategy to follow. White must now choose a plan. White perhaps hoped  black would play O-O as the white pieces are setup for a kingside attack. But now he has to choose another plan. d4 is the most logical but this suits black as it gives him a target for playing his own freeing ..e5; and there can often be tactical opportunities involving black rooks on the d and e files and discovered attacks on the opposing white queen on the d file. Part (g) of his plan has been executed and his development plan has been successful
227,7,13,Nb6,b'2kr3r/ppq2ppp/1npbpn2/5b2/8/P1NPBN1P/1PPQBPP1/3R1RK1 w - -',White may play b4 b5  so black delays ideas of ..e5 for now. If white's attack proves dangerous he can play ..Nd5 and remove the dangerous white bishop from the dark square diagonal

Black observes a tactic involving ..Nxe3 Qxe3 Bc5 followed by a kingside attack. If white instead plays ..Nxe3 fe then black can play ..g5! immediately with good chances. Note that the b-file knight is preferred for this move due to the tactical advantage of retaining the other knight on the kingside

Black's plan is to first get his pawns to e4 and f4 then the move e3 or f3 will force white to lose more material to protect the king or avoid a pawn promotion. In the meantime white has some threats around b4-b5. If he can make use of N+B+R effectively he may be able to generate problems for black

247,8,9,1b4,b'r2qk2r/5pbp/p1npb3/3Np2Q/1pP1Pp2/N2B4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',My first real deviation onto theoretical sideroads. Theory dictates that ..b4 is inferior to ..bc as it closes the position for black on the qs leaving black's only opportunities on the kingside while white retains options on both wings. However this is the reason I wanted to try it: black can focus on the kingside and does not need to deal with the myriad of additional threats white can make after the flexible ..bc. Black has an advanced f pawn a semi-open g-file against the castled white king an active light-square bishop and is preparing moves like ..Rg8 ..h5..h4 and even has the option to play ..f5 to increase the mobility of his central pawns. This game is interesting as it demonstrates the practical problems black has to hold his qs together after ..b5. The big problem of course is white's c-pawn and on reflection I now think as a result of the game and the problems I faced from white playing c5 that it is better to play ..bc

251,8,13,1b3,b'1r1qk2r/5pbp/2npb3/p2Np2Q/2P1Pp2/Pp1B4/1PN2PPP/R2R2K1 w k -',Black wants to close down the queenside so that he can castle and shortly play ..f5

256,8,18,Ne7,b'1r3rk1/3qnpb1/3pb2p/p2Np2Q/2P1Pp2/Pp1B1N1P/1P3PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Black is just a few moves too late. If he can get a rook on the c-file he can play ..Rc5 to stop c5
257,8,19,2c5,b'1r3rk1/3qnpb1/3pb2p/p1PNp2Q/4Pp2/Pp1B1N1P/1P3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',+-

Black intends to get his central pawns rolling revealing an attack on the b2 pawn. He will lose a pawn or 2 in the process but hopes to distract white with his advanced b-pawn. This already looked like a loss for black due to white's central pawns and major pieces. Black's only consolation is opposite coloured bishops but its unlikely he can exchange off the knights to steer the game towards a draw. White has too many threats
259,8,21,2a4,b'1r3rk1/3qn1b1/3p3p/p1PPpp1Q/P4p2/1p1B1N1P/1P3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',Logical fixing the a5 pawn to be collected later
260,8,22,2e4,b'1r3rk1/3qn1b1/3p3p/p1PP1p1Q/P3pp2/1p1B1N1P/1P3PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',This does not worry white as he has the intermezzo Bb5 to avoid losing a piece
261,8,23,Qd8,b'1r1q1rk1/4n1b1/3p3p/pBPP1p1Q/P3pp2/1p3N1P/1P3PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Black has nowhere else for his queen. ..Qa7 would be silly moving the queen away from the action
262,8,24,2Nd2,b'1r1q1rk1/4n1b1/3p3p/pBPP1p1Q/P3pp2/1p5P/1P1N1PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',White has a lot of time to execute his plan
263,8,25,2Bxb2,b'1r1q1rk1/4n3/3p3p/pBPP1p1Q/P3pp2/1p5P/1b1N1PP1/2RR2K1 w - -',Material equality again (6p vs 6p). But whose position would you prefer and who has the broken pawn structure? Black's only consolation is that white must play accurately and patiently to get the full point (as this game demonstrates)
264,8,26,2Nc4,b'1r1q1rk1/4n1b1/3p3p/pBPP1p1Q/P1N1pp2/1p5P/5PP1/1R1R2K1 b - -',In analysis Nxb3 was also unpleasant for black. It is difficult for any plan white chooses to be wrong. This position is beautiful for white. But black hopes to make white's life difficult using his b-pawn
265,8,27,2Nxd6,b'1r1q1rk1/4n1b1/3N3p/pBPP1p1Q/P3pp2/7P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 b - -',Correct. White can hold white's b-pawn although as mentioned Nxb2 is not bad either
266,8,28,2Qc7,b'1r3rk1/2q1n1b1/3N3p/pBPP1p1Q/P3pp2/7P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Inviting the loss of the exchange as the knight on d6 is too strong. The most challenging move for white otherwise black will quickly be crushed
267,8,29,Qxc5,b'4Brk1/4n1b1/7p/p1qP1p1Q/P3pp2/7P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Black got the best position he could hope for getting rid of one of the central pawns and the dangerous white knight. Black hopes the pawn on b2 will prove uncomfortable for white tying up one of his rooks and neutralising white's material advantage
268,8,30,3Qh4,b'5rk1/6b1/2qP3p/p4p2/P3pp1Q/7P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 b - -',Black must allow white an extra pawn
269,8,31,Rd8,b'3r2k1/3q2b1/3P3p/p4p2/P3pQ2/7P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Still tricky for white to win. He must play accurately. This is a good position to analyse
270,8,32,e3,b'3r3k/3P2b1/7p/p2Q1p2/q7/4p2P/1p3PP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Black wants to hold onto his f5 pawn for now. There follows some queen play contesting central influence
271,8,33,Qb4,b'3r3k/3P2b1/3Q3p/p4p2/1q6/4P2P/1p4P1/1R1R2K1 w - -',The thought of pushing the black a pawn and connecting with his b pawn is enticing but black does not have time and must play the position. Unfortunately black cannot afford to keep queens on the board (which he would prefer to increase tactical opportunities). This is true even at the expense of doubling b-pawns. I found this position from analysis at move 32 and could find nothing better.
272,8,34,axb4,b'3r3k/3P2b1/7p/5p2/1p6/4P2P/1p4P1/1R1R2K1 w - -',Yes unpleasant looking doubled b-pawns. My analysis indicated that black was unlikely to hold onto the a-pawn for long
273,8,35,4Kf2,b'3r3k/3P2b1/7p/5p2/1p6/4P2P/1p3KP1/1R1R4 b - -',Once the white king is in position he will roll the e g and h pawns to victory. Black can only play accurately and watch
274,8,36,Be5,b'3r4/3P4/4k2p/4bp2/1p6/3RPK1P/1p4P1/3R4 w - -',Black's king is in position. He will now just move his bishop around while white executes his plan
275,8,37,fxe4+,b'3r4/3P2b1/4k2p/3R4/1p2p3/5KPP/1p6/3R4 w - -',Forced. This gives white the e-file for one of his rooks to push the black king to the right
276,8,38,Bd2,b'3r4/3P4/4k2p/1R6/1p2K1P1/7P/1p1b4/3R4 w - -',Just delaying
277,8,39,5Rf1+,b'3r4/3P4/5k1p/4R3/1p2K1P1/7P/1p1b4/5R2 b - -',Black's king is now disconnected from the game. White's material advantage will start to tell
278,8,40,5h4,b'3r4/3PR3/6kp/8/1p2K1PP/8/1p1b4/5R2 b - -',Once white has his passed pawn the rest is a formality
279,8,41,5b1=Q+,b'3r4/3PR3/6kp/8/1p2K1PP/8/3b4/1q3R2 w - -',Forcing the exchange of pawns (b and d) to allow black's rook to contest the queenside and block white's mating threats
280,8,42,Rxd7,b'4R3/3r4/5k1p/8/1p2K1PP/8/3b4/1R6 w - -',This is an instructive ending. Black now wants to exchange his b pawn off for one of white's ks pawns and then try to hold the ending. White either wants to a) push his connected pawns forward exchange off black's h pawn and win black's b pawn using a combination of threats of pawn promotion and pressure against the black king or b) Exchange off a rook with the black king on his back rank the white rook on the 7th rank and the white queen advanced. The threat of mate will allow white to collect black's b pawn. The mating threats of the 2 white rooks is strong black's choices are limited
281,8,43,6Kxe4,b'5k2/8/7p/7P/1p2K1P1/8/3b4/3R4 b - -',Black resigns. The position is lost the bishop cannot protect both pawns. A beautifully played game from my opponent who needed a win to stay in the Gameknot GM section of the tournament (after he lost the other game). I learned a lot in this game -- and I hope you enjoyed some of the themes and tactics covered here and share my opinion that the Sveshnikov is an interesting variation of the Sicillian with many rich lines for black to play
282,9,0,Nxg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This is my first annotation for the knights of honor coaching project. This is a strange variation of the grand prix attack used very rarly in high level play. Its tactically very sharp and white in particular has to be very careful since he has sacrificed his queen.
283,9,1,Bxf7+,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This is the best move for white. Nxf7 would be wrong because of Qd4
284,9,2,Be6+,b'rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/4B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',There are perhaps two options Ke8 or Kc6. I chose Kc6 since it seems to be the most popular reply.
285,9,3,Bxg4,b'rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',White recovers material for his queen.
286,9,4,e5,b'rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/2k5/2p1p1N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ e6',There are two options for black to activate his bishop. e6 and e5 both seem quite common. White would lose his knight if he captured the e5 pawn. If the pawn were on e6 instead Nxe6 would be a mistake because of Qh4+.
287,9,5,Qf6,b'rn3b1r/pp3Npp/2k2q2/2p1p3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',Perhaps Qh4+ then exf4 would have been better. Qxg4 would be a mistake because of Nxe5+ forking king and queen.
288,9,6,1Nxe5+,b'rn3b1r/pp4pp/2k2q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',Perhaps Kd6 followed by Qxf4 is better.
289,9,7,1Nc3,b'rn3b1r/ppk3pp/5q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Leaving the king where it is leads to Nd5+ losing the queen. Moving the king to b6 also leads to the knight moving to the same square. Moving to d6 now loses to Nxe4+
290,9,8,1Nd5,b'rn1k1b1r/pp4pp/5q2/2pNN3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Moving the queen to h6 or d6 leads to a fork of the king queen and rook by Nf7+ There are no safe places for the queen. Qa6 stops immediate capture.
291,9,9,Ke8,b'rn2kb1r/pp3Npp/q7/2pN4/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',15.Nc7+ Kxf7 16.Nxa6 Nxa6. This is the line I expected. However white has other ideas. He can win my rook and lose nothing.
292,9,10,1Be6,b'rn2kb1N/pp4pp/3qB3/2pN4/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Qxe6 would be a mistake because of Nc7+ so I develop a piece instead.
293,9,11,1f5,b'r3kb1N/pp4pp/n2qB3/2pN1P2/4p3/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The bishop is no longer protected so white plays f5.
294,9,12,1Nc7,b'r3kb1N/ppn3pp/3qB3/2pN1P2/4p3/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',The game is already over I can't think of a better move white has all the initiative.
295,9,13,Kxd7,b'r4b2/ppnk1Npp/3q4/2pN1P2/4p3/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ -',No chance of avoiding the loss of the queen. White is simplfying in order to increase his material advantage.
296,9,14,g5,b'4r3/ppn4p/8/2bk1Pp1/8/1P4N1/1BPP2PP/R2K3R w - g6',Not the best move since the white pawn on f5 becomes a problem later.
297,9,15,Re7,b'3b4/1p2rP2/p3n2p/3k2N1/R7/1P6/1BPP2PP/3KR3 w - -',Although the pawn is threatening to promote white is really heading for checkmate.
298,9,16,3Bd4#,b'3b4/1p3P2/pk2r2p/4R3/2RB4/1P6/2PP2PP/3K4 b - -',The game is now over
299,10,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',The Philidor defense is earning more respect nowadays than 30-40 years ago and it's not a surprise guest at GMs tournaments anymore.
300,10,1,Bg4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Not the best in fact I believe I have a personal score of 100% in this line. This is also what was used in the famous Morphy - Count Isouard game a perfect attacking jewel that will never lose its beauty.
301,10,2,dxe5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Forcing Black to give up the Bishop for the Knight or else lose a pawn.
302,10,3,Bc4,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',White has a good lead in development and amongst other things is threatening mate on f7. 
303,10,4,Qe7,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',6...Qd7 is slightly better but 6...Nf6 is outright bad after which at least 3 of my own games that I can remember went 7. Qb3 Qd7 8. Qxb7 Qc6 9. Bb5
304,10,5,Nc3,b'rn2kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Aiming for d5 hitting the Queen.
305,10,6,c6,b'rn2kbnr/pp2qppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Covers both d5 and b5 but it's another pawn move and another lag in development.
306,10,7,Bg5,b'rn2kbnr/pp2qppp/2p5/4p1B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',This is one of the reasons why 6...Qd7 is better.

308,10,9,O-O-O,b'rn2kbnr/pp2q1pp/2p2p2/4p1B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',The dance has begun!

310,10,11,1Nd5,b'rn2kbnr/pp2q1pp/2p5/3Np1p1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',This looks just insane but it's the only move that doesn't concede the initiative to Black.
311,10,12,1cxb7,b'r3kbnr/1P2q1pp/8/1p2p1p1/8/5Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',White is two pieces down but his compensation isn't virtual. The b7 pawn is very strong and the Black monarch is still in trouble.
312,10,13,1Rd7,b'1r3bnr/1P1Rqkpp/2Q5/1p2p1p1/8/8/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - -',A nice conclusion to the storm of sacrifices initiated earlier.
313,10,14,Bxe7,b'1r5r/1P2bkpp/2Q2n2/1p2p1p1/8/8/PPP2PPP/2K4R w - -',Theoretically material is even and under different circumstance White would be the one in trouble but Black has serious problems coordinating his pieces.

I expected Bh3 and tried to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the bishop being on g2. The main advantage is the overprotection of the d5 pawn the prevention of black tactical finesses involving ..Nfe4 and a discovered attack with the bishop on g7 as well as the possibility of moving to e4 at some point to press against black's g6 pawn. The main disadvantage is the bishop being blocked for most of the game by the d5 pawn the inability to support the move g4  and the inability to later contest the h3-c8 light-square diagonal when black switches his bishop via c8 to the f5 square (very typical in this line as white usually places his queen on c2).

White wants to restrict black's movements on the queenside and press ahead with his play in the center. Threatening the black queen and a5 pawn forces black to play accurately. Nc4 also compliments a later f4 and either e5 or f5 pawn push

Black will choose the best square for his queen later once minor pieces are deployed and white's intentions are clear. For example ..Qc7 looks ok but is anti-thematic as it allows white moves like Nb5 and a4. This is ok for black but takes the game into different territory

He exchanges intending to push ..c4 in a few moves move his knight to c5 and build a 2-pronged attack against e4 and b2. This also frees the b6 square for the queen later (which can gain a tempo with check should white play f4 as is common in Bg5 lines)
404,15,9,Ne5,b'r2q1rk1/4ppbp/3p1np1/p1pPn1B1/2B1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',This is also a common square for the black knight in the benko. Black wants white to play f4 at some stage chasing his piece away as the knight is just passing through. The extra tempo will be important later

This position looks quite contrived with every black piece participating harmonically in the attack on the queenside. Yet it is a textbook setup in the benko and one of the ways black converts his extra tempos into material gain. The danger to white is not black winning his pawn back but the initiative he carries. Observe at this point the risks to white. 1) After losing e4 to the black knight the d5 pawn is weak also 2) The black queen and knight are targetting the f2 square white needs to be careful

436,16,13,2Re1,b'r5k1/p6p/3qr1p1/3N4/2PQp3/P7/1P4PP/4R2K b - -',At first glance this looks like a win for black based on him being the exchange up. Looking more closely it is clear that the position holds lots of potential for white and black might have to fight for a draw. The 3 queenside pawns are extremely dangerous and black lacks open files to whip his rooks around the board and create threats. White's queen is central exerting powerful influence and controls the only entry point into white's defences (the f2 square) as well as being well positioned to support a queenside pawn roller. Black has a real problem and can easily lose. Its important for black to play actively and create more open lines for his rooks (even at the cost of material) otherwise soon white will have pawns on the sixth rank and black will be fighting for a draw.

442,16,19,2b3,b'5rk1/7p/4r1p1/p2Nq3/2P1p3/PP2Q3/6PP/1R5K b - -',White is in no hurry. Let black make a rash move
443,16,20,2g5,b'5rk1/7p/4r3/p2Nq1p1/2P1p3/PP2Q3/6PP/1R5K w - -',!!? This leads to extremely sharp play. Black now seeks play against the white king via the hfile.  White in the process may be able to win black's e and a pawns. And white will also be able to move much more freely on the queenside now one of black's rooks is out of the way.  If I lacked time to analyse and needed to avoid a loss I would have played the cautious ..Rc8 instead

Up to this point I still had 4 games in my database all of which played Bh4 keeping the pin. This may be objectively better but at some point I have to deviate and I had an interesting idea in this position. With h4 I used an Alekhine idea of prying open the h-file and displacing the knight on f6 who guards h7. I ran a database search of games where white plays h4 with similar qualities and found 555 games. After quickly playing through about 15 or so of them (alekhine-capa game 32 got me distracted..) I decided it was worth calculating out.
I saw a couple key lines here
1) hxg5 hxg5 Bxg2 (Ne8 leads to mate)rh2 and either I capture the knight or pileup on b1-h7 diagonal - reviewing this later I discovered that Black has the annoying f5 move but I didnt see that line in the game
2) Bxg2 Rg1 and if Bb7 Bxh6
3) the line in the game where Black surrenders control of it's diagonal for a pawn.

701,30,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Nf6 is a common counter for black.
702,30,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm preparing to play e4 next.  If my opponent plays 3...d5 I intend to transpose into a gambit position with 4. d4.
703,30,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays g6 in preparation for the fianchettoed dark bishop on g7.  c5 would have been just as good but in this case my opponent preferred the hyper-accelerated dragon.
704,30,4,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',With e4 I establish control of the center early.  d6 is now dominated by the Knight on c3 as well as the c and e pawns.  Black must play baseline defense.
705,30,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',d6 is a likely move.  Black anticipates the harassment of the f6 Knight with 4. e5.  
706,30,6,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1PP2/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',I prefer playing f4 early.  This enables the eventual Nf3 move with out blocking the f-pawn.  I love wide open pawns on the c-f files.  This creates an explosive advantage for white opening up for rooks on the e and f files later on.
707,30,7,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq c6',A solid book move for black.  c5 challenges the d-pawn and helps black take some of his own control of the center.  It also creates a good opportunity for a knight or dark squared bishop outpost on d4.
708,30,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Nf3 is the logical progression for white followed by Be2...O-O.  The knight is key in defending the d4 and e5 squares.
709,30,9,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black will impose his own Knight on the d4 and e5 squares while developing a minor piece.  I'm not sure why Nc6 was selected instead of Bg7.  Black probably recognized that there was no hurry in moving the bishop to g7 because the tempo of my opening presents no imminent threats to the king side. 
710,30,10,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',d3 is a conservative move.  It is not as sharp as d4 but it does open up the diagonal for the dark squared bishop as well as supports the c and e pawns.  Certainly Be2 would have allowed for castling king side on move seven but since black delayed the fianchettoed bishop I can linger with a more methodical opening.  I have played Bd3 on a few occasions but it is a very unorthodox opening move and severely hampers the d-pawn dark squared bishop--ultimately only creates problems.  The bishop will do fine on e2 temporarily.
711,30,11,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',The expected move for black.

This is the natural course of events that most defenders against this variation of the English will follow to foil whites control of d5.
715,30,15,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',It will take another two moves for black to play b5.  This will give me a chance to create some problems of my own for black.  I intend to play g4 followed by g5 harassing the Knight on f6. h3 also creates an escape for my King later on and allows the protection of the fork on g3 if black plays Nh5...Ng3; in addition it prevents the annoying Bg4.
716,30,16,Rb8,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',As I said before black's design is to play b5 in hopes of distracting the pawn on c4 from the d5 square.  This really presents no immediate problem however because the d3 pawn will recapture on c4 if black threatens to take.  Of course black could follow b5 with b4! threatening the Knight on c3 but such a move would only hyper-extend my opponent's resources.  At any rate the threat of b4 is benign.
717,30,17,1g4,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PPP1/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 b - g3',Following through with my own intentions after playing h3.  If my opponent allows me to play f5 it will create trouble for his kingside.  Should black permit f5 to be played it would behoove him not to capture with the g-pawn.  This is a designed attack following that of many against the Sicilian Dragon in the past: crack open in the g and h files and reek havock on black's kingside!
718,30,18,1h5,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1np1np1/2p4p/2P1PPP1/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 w - h6',Black wishes for 11. gxh5 because my attack would fizzle out after 11...Nxh5.  Perhaps black also saw 11. g5 Ne8 12. Kh2 Qd7 13. Ng1 Bd4!...as advantageous.  In fact he followed almost this exact move order.  But after 14. Rf3 Bxg1 15. Qxg1...it was unclear to me how black proposed to continue his attach.  Instead black's light squared bishop would be incapacitated which proved to be detrimental later in the game.
719,30,19,1g5,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1np1np1/2p3Pp/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I had already played through the posibilities in my mind.  11...Bxh3 12. gxf6 Bxf1 13. fxg7 fxe2 14. gxf8+ Kxf8 15. Qxe2... does not work out well for black.  Neither does 11...Bxh3 12. gxf6 Qd7 13. fxg7 Qg4+...because my king escapes by 14. Kf2 Qg2+ 15. Ke2... all is well.  The obvious next move for black then is Ne8.
720,30,20,1Ne8,b'1rbqnrk1/1p2ppb1/p1np2p1/2p3Pp/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black's best response to g5.  Nh7 would have been an elementary mistake.

723,30,23,1Ng1,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qppb1/p1np2p1/2p3Pp/2P1PP2/2NP3P/PP2B2K/R1BQ1RN1 b - -',Simple enough Ng1 provides another layer of protection for the h-pawn.  If black plays 13...Bd4 my response will be 14. Rf3...

After black played Qd7 I fully expected him to continue with trying to break down my defense with 13...Bd4.  Perhaps my opponent realized after congesting his queenside that Bd4 was a waste of time after 14. Rf3 Bxg1 15. Qxg1...What black probably didn't expect after 13. Nd4 was my next move...
725,30,25,1f5,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qppb1/p2p2p1/2p2PPp/2PnP3/2NP3P/PP2B2K/R1BQ1RN1 b - -',My point in making this move was to release black's protection of the h-pawn.  It is possible that black saw 14. f5 gxf5 15. exf5 Nxf5 16. Bxh5...as a harmless exchange of material but probably not.  More likely is that his analysis missed the hanging pawn on h5 should he capture on f5.
726,30,26,1Be5+,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p1bPPp/2PnP3/2NP3P/PP2B2K/R1BQ1RN1 w - -',Black is doing his best to prevent the potential entrapment of his fianchettoed bishop in the corner after I play f6.  I assume this wasn't so much a threat as much an attempt to keep his bishop active.  
727,30,27,1Bf4,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p1bPPp/2PnPB2/2NP3P/PP2B2K/R2Q1RN1 b - -',This move actually helps me develope my dark squared bishop and gain tempo while I interpose.
728,30,28,1Nxe2,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p1bPPp/2P1PB2/2NP3P/PP2n2K/R2Q1RN1 w - -',Black probably expected 16. Qxe2 giving him the opportunity to play either 16...Bd4 attaching the Knight on g1 or 16...gxf5--Neither of which would have gained my opponent anything however after I play 17. Be3... or 17. Bxe5 respectively.
729,30,29,1Bxe5,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p1BPPp/2P1P3/2NP3P/PP2n2K/R2Q1RN1 b - -',I prefer to eliminate the dark squared bishop and keep my own--I am placing black in decision mode.  He can either exchange the bishops or go for 16...Nxg1 17. Bf4/Bg3 Nxh3.  Either scenerio works out well for me because I keep an attacker with the dark squared bishop on his exposed kingside with the latter (even with the loss of material) and have good position with the former with a Knight outpost on d5.
730,30,30,1Nxg1,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p1BPPp/2P1P3/2NP3P/PP5K/R2Q1Rn1 w - -',So goes the plan: Black takes on g1.  Black may have expected my next move to be Bg3 but I had other plans...

I reasoned that his line of thinking went something like this: he probably figured after 17...Nxh3 18. Kxh3 gxf5 white wouldn't play 19. Qxh5 because of the discover check on 19...fxe4+!  My opponent was correct if he thought this only my counter to this line was as tricky as his perceived plan of attack after gxf5--if not more dangerous.
732,30,32,1Nxh3,b'1rb1nrk1/1p1qpp2/p2p2p1/2p2PPp/2P1PB2/2NP3n/PP5K/R2Q1R2 w - -',My opponent plays the only move that preserves his material advantage.

I intended for black to capture the e-pawn but if he played something safer such as 19...Ng7 20. Nd5 e6 21. Nf6+!!!...is a disaster because of the Queen fork.  20...dxe5 is not good for black either after 21. Nf6+ exf6 22. gxf6 exf4 23. fxg7--Black must avoid check mate. I was hoping my opponent's analysis would be a little simpler than this namely that he would perceive 19. e5... as a blunder on my part and capture...

1049,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone! I have just got back from freezing cold Hastings where I was competing in the Weekend Longplay tournament in the U120 ECF grades section. Although only graded 99 I was very pleased with my performance since I ended up with 3.5 points out of 5. I am going to annotate my games in no particular order. This last-round game was the quickest out of all my games: it only lasted 1 hour 20 minutes or so. White an ungraded opponent opened with the King Pawn.
1050,39,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',So I replied with my usual French Defence allowing White to take the centre temporarily with 2.d4 and then striking back at the centre with 2...d5.
1051,39,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White's usual second move placing two pawns in the centre in order to pave the way to quick development. Another feasible option for White is to play 2.Nf3. Also respectable is 2.d3 leading towards a King's Indian Attack.
1052,39,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',So I continued with Black's crucial 2nd move striking back against White's centre. The onus is now on White to decide what to do with his e-pawn. He can advance it forwards locking the central pawn-structure and grabbing a space advantage - 3.e5 the Advance Variation - and Black will then try to undermine White's structure on the queenside. White can also exchange pawns on d5 the Exchange Variation 3.exd5 although this is quite a quiet and (for me) boring opening in which White's only advantage is that of moving first. Or White can defend the pawn and develop a piece with 3.Nc3 (main line) or 3.Nd2 (Tarrasch Variation).
1053,39,4,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',White plays the main line 3.Nc3 so Black renews the pressure on White's e-pawn by pinning the defending knight signalling the start of the lively Winawer Variation. Here White's most usual choice is to advance the e-pawn: the main line runs 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3. Another feasible option which several tournament opponents have played against me is to transpose into an Exchange Variation with 4.exd5. However White's next move is one that I have never played against before.
1054,39,5,Bd2,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',(?!) This move sacrifices the e-pawn after 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 or 5.bxc3 dxe4. I could see nothing wrong with grabbing the pawn so I moved accordingly.
1055,39,6,dxe4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',The most obvious continuation I could see for White was 6.f3 turning the pawn sacrifice into a gambit: 6...exf3 7.Nxf3 and White has a lead in development of 2 minor pieces to 0. However I did not feel that White had compensation for his sacrificed pawn. Another idea I could see for White was 6.d5 discovering an attack against Black's g7-pawn but 6...Nf6 and I did not feel that this attack had any real bite. White may ruin Black's pawn-structure in the future with Bxf6 when Black's queen is not defending but that's all.
1056,39,7,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Blocking White's attack and also developing a piece. This move also puts pressure on White's over-zealous d-pawn.
1057,39,8,Bb5+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/1B1P4/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Again this aggressive move might look a bit worrying but it really has no bite whatsoever. In fact it may even be a mistake as Black's blocking move paves the way to a queen exchange which is the best way for Black to consolidate his extra pawn.
1058,39,9,dxc6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2P1pn2/1B6/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',White chooses to exchange his pawn off: this is the only way to avoid losing even more material. However Black can now exchange queens which greatly lessens the counterplay that White might try.
1059,39,10,Nxc6,b'r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/1B6/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/3RK1NR w Kkq -',I recaptured the pawn reaching a middlegame in which the queens have been exchanged off and Black is up a pawn. I was now expecting White to start trying some counterplay against my extra pawn: for example building up pressure on it with Ng1-e2-g3 Bxf6. I might simply have returned the pawn to White so as not to get too hung up defending it.
1060,39,11,Bd7,b'r3k2r/pp1b1ppp/2n1pn2/1B6/4p3/2B5/PPP1NPPP/3RK2R w Kkq -',Breaking the pin on Black's knight and preparing for even more exchanges. My main idea here was to exchange as much off as possible and go into a winning pawn endgame with one extra pawn.
1061,39,12,O-O-O,b'2kr3r/pp1b1ppp/2n1pn2/1B6/4p3/2B5/PPP1NPPP/3R1RK1 w - -',No way was I going to castle kingside because if 11...O-O 12.Bxf6 gxf6 and Black's king is very vulnerable to White's rooks attacking down the g-file. 11...O-O-O is much safer. 11...O-O-O also has the benefit of placing a rook automatically on the d-file which prepares for - you guessed it - more exchanges!
1062,39,13,1Nd4,b'2kr3r/pp1b1ppp/2n1pn2/1B6/3Np3/2B5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',(?) I would give this move a question mark because it is extremely tame and plays right into Black's hands. I was expecting 12.Ng3 threatening 13.Bxf3 gxf3 14.Nxe4 winning the pawn back. White's choice here is tamely allowing all the pieces to be exchanged off. Looking at this move it does not even look as if White is trying to win the game.
1063,39,14,1Nxd4,b'2kr3r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B6/3np3/2B5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',I gladly took White up on his offer initiating a series of exchanges.
1064,39,15,1Bxd7+,b'2kr3r/pp1B1ppp/4pn2/8/3np3/2B5/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - -',Forced otherwise White loses the bishop.
1065,39,16,Rhd8,b'2kr4/pp1r1ppp/4pn2/8/3Bp3/8/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 w - -',This is a strong move that forces most of the remaining pieces to be exchanged off. White's only chance to avoid losing material is 15.Bxf6
1066,39,17,Rxd8,b'2kr4/pp3ppp/4p3/8/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/5RK1 w - -',"16...Rxd8 is stronger than 16...Rxf1+ 17.Kxf1 Kxd8 followed by a ""king race"" into the centre. After the text Black is threatening 17...Rd2 placing his rook in a very powerful position on the 2nd rank: White's rook will then be tied down defensively on c1 and White's king will also be prevented from charging into the centre. I don't think White can actually prevent this move."
1067,39,18,Kd7,b'8/pp1k1ppp/4p3/8/4p3/1P6/P1Pr1PPP/2R3K1 w - -',Now it's time for my king to jump into the action. I was looking to lodge my king on either c3 or a3 to start hoovering up White's queenside pawns. Then Black's more active king and rook will win the endgame.
1068,39,19,2h3,b'8/pp3ppp/2k1p3/8/4p3/1P5P/P1Pr1PP1/2R2K2 b - -',(?) Surely it is far better for White to chase away Black's powerful rook with 20.Ke1 - the text does absolutely nothing for White.
1069,39,20,2Kc5,b'8/pp3ppp/4p3/2k5/4p3/1P5P/P1Pr1PP1/2R2K2 w - -',I take advantage of White's waste of a move by advancing my king further aiming at the golden spot of c3.
1070,39,21,Kd4,b'8/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3kp3/PP5P/2Pr1PP1/2R2K2 w - -',This stops my king from landing on a3 but this is a futile move. White cannot stop Black's king from reaching both c3 and a3 so he is better off not trying - instead 21.Ke1 to chase Black's rook away.
1071,39,22,Kc3,b'8/pp3ppp/4p3/8/4p3/PPk4P/2Pr1PP1/2R1K3 w - -',Too late White. Now Black's king is so far advanced that he does not have to retreat the rook he only has to defend it with the king. However I was not planning to capture White's pawn with 23...Rxc2 as this is met by 24.Rd1 preparing for 25.Rd7 and hoovering up all my vulnerable pawns on the 7th rank. I had far too much to lose if I allowed that to happen.
1072,39,23,2Rd1,b'8/pp3ppp/4p3/8/4p3/PPk4P/2Pr1PP1/3RK3 b - -',Black must exchange rooks as otherwise he surrenders the 7th rank to White's rook.
1073,39,24,f5,b'8/pp4pp/4p3/5p2/4p3/PPk4P/2P2PP1/3K4 w - f6',Now Black can win very quickly. Black's 5 kingside pawns will easily break through against White's 3 kingside pawns. White has a queenside pawn majority but it is immobilised by Black's perfectly placed king. If White moves his king to defend the kingside Black's king kills all White's queenside pawns and pushes his own queenside pawns home. If White's king tries manoeuvring Kd1-c1-b1-a2 in an attempt to push his queenside pawns Black plays ...Kxc2 and then pushes his kingside pawns: White's plan is too slow.
1074,39,25,a5,b'8/1p5p/4p3/p4pp1/P3p3/1Pk4P/2P2PP1/2K5 w - a6',Black's only deviation from his plan. This move holds White's queenside pawns firmly in place.
1075,39,26,g4,b'8/1p6/4p3/p4p1p/P3p1p1/1Pk4P/2P2PP1/2K5 w - -',White's king is being completely indecisive: he has lost 4 moves out of the last 5. Black's tidal wave of kingside pawns is unstoppable and will break through easily.
1076,39,27,f4,b'8/1p6/8/p3p3/P3ppp1/1Pk3P1/2P2P2/3K4 w - -',White resigns. Black has an easily won endgame and will queen very quickly.
