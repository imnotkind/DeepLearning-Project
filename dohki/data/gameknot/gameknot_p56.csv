22,2,1,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/3p4/3P1B2/7P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Black usually does pretty well with Pe6 or Pc5 here.

24,2,3,1Qa3,b'r4rk1/4qpp1/p3pn1p/1pnp4/5NP1/Q3P2P/PPPN1P2/2KR3R b - -',Pb4 strikes my fancy.  Doubtful white would take it though.

30,2,9,4Nb2,b'6k1/6p1/7p/5p1r/1p2pP2/1P1nP3/1N2R3/1K6 b - -',Up two points black should trade.
31,2,10,4Na4,b'6k1/8/7p/2n2ppr/Np2pP2/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 b - -',Now don't trade...  Nd3 looks good.
32,2,11,4fxg5,b'6k1/8/4n2p/5pPr/Np2p3/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 b - -',Use the rook so it is out of the way and the h pawn is passed.
33,2,12,4hxg5,b'6k1/8/4n3/5ppr/Np2p3/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 w - -',I guess it is still passes--and the rook is out of the way--and the pawn is ahead.  And it supports the other pawns.  Yeah this was better.
34,2,13,4Nb6,b'6k1/8/1N2n3/5ppr/1p2p3/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 b - -',White will want to move Nd5 to take the pawn.  Black can defend with Nc5 then Nd3.  Nc7 also works temporarily.
35,2,14,4Kf7,b'8/5k2/1N2n3/5ppr/1p2p3/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 w - -',But not that.  Black could also run the g pawn tying up white's rook.
36,2,15,f4,b'8/5k2/4n3/3N2pr/1p2pp2/1P2P3/2K1R3/8 w - -',Oops.  Now white gets a pawn.
37,2,16,Rh4,b'8/5k2/8/8/1p2Rp1r/1P6/2K5/8 w - -',I think Rf5 would have been better.  Black's advantage now evaporates.
38,2,17,Kxb7,b'8/1k6/8/8/3K4/8/8/8 w - -',
39,3,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So he starts conventionally
40,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',I play the Sicilian
41,3,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He develops his knight preparing d2-d4
42,3,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',And I develop mine.
43,3,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',He pushes
44,3,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I take
45,3,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',He takes back
46,3,7,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I hit his e pawn
47,3,8,Nc3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',He protects it.
48,3,9,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',"I prevent him from playing Nd4xNc6 followed by e4-e5. This is really the parting of the way next. He can play  6.Bc4 called ""Sozin"" (ECO code B57). It brings the bishop to an aggressive square or 6.Bg5 the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack (ECO codes B60 et seq). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. He plays the thrid most popular move at this point."
49,3,10,Be2,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Quite playable but perhaps less agreesive that the previously mentioned moves.
50,3,11,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq e6',This is the Boleslavsky Variation named after Isaac Boleslavsky. Black gets a foothold in the centre but has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file. Both sides have chances.
51,3,12,Nb3,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',"This is the old move which used to be considered the ""main line"". Now Nf3 is more common."
52,3,13,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',So I develop.
53,3,14,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',He castles
54,3,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',I castle.
55,3,16,Be3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"He develops. Now I have had this position before. See http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/hagley-v-kidderminster?gm=44180
In that game I continued with Be6 and d6-d5. There were exchanges on d5 and then on the d file and the game ended in a draw. So I decided to play something else which seemed to keep the pieces on more."
56,3,17,a5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2np1n2/p3p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - a6',I threaten to drive his knight away from b3. If it goes to d2 it blocks the d file allowing d6-d5 without so many exchanges and if it goes to c1 it stops the co-ordination of rooks along his back rank.
57,3,18,1a4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2np1n2/p3p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - a3',So he stops that.
58,3,19,1Be6,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/2npbn2/p3p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And now I develop the bishop.

60,3,21,1Nb4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p3p3/Pn2P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1R1K w - -',So I get another piece on d5 and also in some variations the attack on c2 is important.
61,3,22,1f4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p3p3/Pn2PP2/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - f3',This is the thematic advance for white in this variation.
62,3,23,1exf4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p7/Pn2Pp2/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',So I take preventing f4-f5 and chances of a king side attack.
63,3,24,1Bxf4,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p7/Pn2PB2/1NN5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',So he takes back. Now my d6 pawn is isolated too - but so is his e pawn. I was thinking of playing Qb6 here with a threat of Nxc2 followed by taking on b3. However that threat is easily met with Nd4 so I decided to play something else.
64,3,25,1Rc8,b'2rq1rk1/1p2bppp/3pbn2/p7/Pn2PB2/1NN5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',"This move pins his Nc3 as if it moves I will have both rook and knight attacking c2. I didn't know it at the time but all this has been seen before. There are 5 games on the Gameknot ""World"" database each continuing with Bf3 with one win for white one for black and 3 draws. Three of these games continued with d5 15. e5 Ne4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Bxe4. My opponent now makes a dreadful mistake.

67,3,28,1Nxe4,b'2rq1rk1/1p2bppp/3pb3/p7/Pn2NB2/1N6/1PPQB1PP/R4R1K b - -',He takes.
68,3,29,1Rxc2,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pb3/p7/Pn2NB2/1N6/1PrQB1PP/R4R1K w - -',And another pawn goes.
69,3,30,1Qe3,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3pb3/p7/Pn2NB2/1N2Q3/1Pr1B1PP/R4R1K b - -',"Now Pat told me after the game he envisaged this position after he played Qd1-d2? and thought ""Well so what my queen protects the knight and the bishop he will take on b2 and then I have to do something about the knight on b3. I'll have a extra minor piece in return for three pawns."" Find my improvement on this...."
70,3,31,1Bxb3,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/1b2Q3/1Pr1B1PP/R4R1K w - -',"Did you find this? Of course if now he takes my bishop I take his. His queen was over-worked protecting both Be2 and Nb3. I actually woke in the middle of the night following this game thinking ""Hang on couldn't he play Bd1 here attacking both my rook on c2 and my bishop on b3?"" I pondered the position in my bed without setting it up. I then realsied I could simply rereat my bishop and if he takes on c2 I take back with my Nb4 forking his Qe3 and Ra1 so regaining the exchange. What he plays next is probably best for him but two pawns down it is very hard for him. He tries to make the best of a bad job."
71,3,32,1Rfd1,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/1b2Q3/1Pr1B1PP/R2R3K b - -',All his pieces are now very active my d pawn is under attack. I find a way of simplifying. 
72,3,33,1Rxe2,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/1b2Q3/1P2r1PP/R2R3K w - -',So I take.
73,3,34,1Qxe2,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/1b6/1P2Q1PP/R2R3K b - -',He takes back
74,3,35,1Bxd1,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/8/1P2Q1PP/R2b3K w - -',I take again.
75,3,36,1Rxd1,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/3p4/p7/Pn2NB2/8/1P2Q1PP/3R3K b - -',He takes back.
76,3,37,1d5,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/Pn2NB2/8/1P2Q1PP/3R3K w - -',I advance the threatened d pawn.
77,3,38,2Qb5,b'3q1rk1/1p2bppp/8/pQ1p4/Pn2NB2/8/1P4PP/3R3K b - -',This looks good attacking three pawns.
78,3,39,2Qe8,b'4qrk1/1p2bppp/8/pQ1p4/Pn2NB2/8/1P4PP/3R3K w - -',I was very pleased at finding this. This forces the queens off as otherwise he loses his knight.
79,3,40,2Qxe8,b'4Qrk1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/Pn2NB2/8/1P4PP/3R3K b - -',So he takes.
80,3,41,2Rxe8,b'4r1k1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/Pn2NB2/8/1P4PP/3R3K w - -',I take back.
81,3,42,2Nd2,b'4r1k1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/Pn3B2/8/1P1N2PP/3R3K b - -',This is a mistake. Better is Nc3 attacking the d pawn again.
82,3,43,2Nd3,b'4r1k1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/P4B2/3n4/1P1N2PP/3R3K w - -',If the knight had retreated to another square his rook would be covering this square.
83,3,44,2Be3,b'4r1k1/1p2bppp/8/p2p4/P7/3nB3/1P1N2PP/3R3K b - -',He retreats his attacked bishop.
84,3,45,2Bg5,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p2b1/P7/3nB3/1P1N2PP/3R3K w - -',I am hoping for him to take my bishop allowing me to play Nf2 forking king and rook.
85,3,46,2Bg1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p2b1/P7/3n4/1P1N2PP/3R2BK b - -',So he retreats to a safe square.
86,3,47,2Nxb2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p2b1/P7/8/1n1N2PP/3R2BK w - -',I finally take the thrid pawn.
87,3,48,2Rb1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p2b1/P7/8/1n1N2PP/1R4BK b - -',He moves his attacked rook.
88,3,49,2Bxd2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/P7/8/1n1b2PP/1R4BK w - -',I take his knight.
89,3,50,2Rxb2,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/P7/8/1R1b2PP/6BK b - -',He takes mine.
90,3,51,2Bb4,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/Pb6/8/1R4PP/6BK w - -',I block his rook from taking my b pawn.
91,3,52,2Rb1,b'4r1k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/Pb6/8/6PP/1R4BK b - -',I was also threatening to play Re1 and Bc4 winning
92,3,53,2Re1,b'6k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/Pb6/8/6PP/1R2r1BK w - -',But I play it anyway forcing an easily won bishop and pawn ending.
93,3,54,2Rxe1,b'6k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/Pb6/8/6PP/4R1BK b - -',So he takes.
94,3,55,2Bxe1,b'6k1/1p3ppp/8/p2p4/P7/8/6PP/4b1BK w - -',I take back. I am now three clear pawns up in a bishop and pawn ending. I will play over the final moves without any further comment as it is a completely won ending. My opponent bravely plays on after all you never know and you learn from playng out such positions. You never gain anything from resigning!
95,3,56,Be3,b'8/7p/1p3p2/p1k3p1/P2p2P1/3Kb2P/8/4B3 w - -',And white resigned. Many thanks for reading please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!

334,10,0,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',The character of the position is now clear. White has acquired a K-side pawn majority and left Black with a Q-side one that is badly disrupted by the doubled Pawns. Black however has the Bishop-pair which could be put to good use in this open position.

667,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',In our first game I played Nf3. I was playing that quite a bit back then. Since then I've read that is not a good opening move against those above the rating of 1800 or so. I've been using KP for a while now and having success at my level. 
668,26,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is the French Defense starting position. A future move for black is d5. From what I've read and experienced this defends the a2-g8 diagonal and reduces the f7 pawn weakness. However it also blocks the black LSB. So in a sense moves the weakness to the back row. A better player would probably know how to exploit this weakness but I am not yet that experienced. 
669,26,2,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P1P1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',Black will naturally want to move d5 so I'd prefer to do something else. I think moving g4 may take him out of this mindset.
670,26,3,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/4P1P1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq h6',Well it worked. Now I'm thinking this through. If I pass the pawn I lose it not an option. if I take the pawn I trade keep him from castling king side (one of my stretch goals!) and take his rook. That said my queen ends up in the open that's NEVER worked out in the past. 
671,26,4,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/4P1PP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq h3',So I advance the h rook hoping he takes the pawn... which I may pick up later. I want to disturb the kingside further.
672,26,5,hxg4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/8/4P1pP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He takes the pawn. While I wanted him to do this it always concerns me when a higher level player does exactly what you expect. It probably means I missed something. 
673,26,6,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7P/4P1p1/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',But I stick to my plan.

675,26,8,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4p2n/7P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I think the black bishop will ultimately land on b4 so I want to get my pawn in play before then. This makes my DSB happy because he can bear down on the pesky knight. In addition it develops the center. I am thinking perhaps the next move will put me in bishop check.
676,26,9,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4p2n/3p3P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',But black continues with his original plans as well pausing things on the kingside.

680,26,13,Qg5,b'rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p2qP/3PP1p1/2N5/PPP2P2/R2QKBNR w KQq -',Well I didn't see that coming. After reviewing this for quite a while it appears I won't be able to castle in this game at all. I don't see anyway to interpose a piece and I certainly am not castling kingside. Having the black rook and queen in this configuration really I really miss my DSB. In fact now that I'm looking at the pawn configuration I REALLY miss my DSB. Don't think the pesky knight was worth it. 
681,26,14,Qd2,b'rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p2qP/3PP1p1/2N5/PPPQ1P2/R3KBNR b KQq -',My thought process: (1) stalhandske can do a lot more damage with a queen than I. (2) the black advanced queen is more dangerous than my queen on the back rank. (3) I'm not going to be able to castle anyway so exchange and get the king active.

I don't see how black can immediately push the king around and now he needs to move to defend the pawn. This gives me the initiative just not sure how long I can maintain. I expect 12...f5.

This just scrambles and isolates white's pawns. Of course this plan implies the longside castling.

Â¿Por quÃ© descuidaron las negras esta situaciÃ³n?.

Yo creÃ­a haber jugado b4 en lugar de b3 esto no se olvida fÃ¡cilmente ya que es una de las jugadas mÃ¡s excitantes pero al revisar la partida me encuentro con ese bug... lo que demuestra que la mente no estÃ¡ continuamente al 100% sino que se producen oscilaciones el la curva de la atenciÃ³n y cuando te pilla en un valle pues metes la pata.

AL fin y al cabo el bug de b3 no tuvo consecuencias: lo curioso es que las negras reaccionaron como si las blancas hubiesen jugado b4 tomando el alfil negro en f2. Tal vez la explicaciÃ³n estÃ© en un anÃ¡lisis mÃ¡s profundo por parte de las negras al probar suerte esperando que el rey blanco tomase el alfil lo que parece razonable ya que el caballo en g4 estaba muy bien posicionado. En este caso auuu fue prudente e iniciÃ³ un rÃ¡pido ""Analize Board"" descubriendo asÃ­ que con el rey en f2 las negras podrÃ­an jugar C x e4+ a lo que blancas deberian jugar d3 x e4 es decir negras cambian el caballo clavado desde el principio por un peÃ³n... pero la dama negra tomarÃ­a el alfil en g5. De esta forma las negras acabarÃ­an con la iniciativa de las blancas y adquirirÃ­an incluso ventaja material de un peÃ³n.

12 ... After the bug b3 did not succeed: the funny thing is that the black reacted as if White had played b4 taking the black bishop on f2. Perhaps the explanation is in a deeper analysis of the black to try his hand waiting for the white king take the bishop which seems reasonable since the horse was well positioned g4. In this case auuu was prudent and began a quick ""Analyze Board"" discovering that with the king at f2 Black could play C x e4 + what white should play d3 x e4 ie Black exchanges the horse nailed from the principle for a pawn ... but the black lady would take the bishop on g5. This would end the black white initiative and even acquire material advantage of a pawn."

I was expecting Qc8 in defence. I was going to continue with Nc3-b5 attacking d6. He would be forced to exchange on b5 and them by bishop can reach h3 with tempo. Qc8 is no better or worse than the game continuation.
1016,34,27,1Nc8,b'1rnqk1nr/3b1pb1/1p1p2p1/p1pPp1Pp/P1P1P2P/2N1BPN1/1P1Q1K2/1R3B1R w k -',His knight is going to a7 to prevent my knight coming in to b5. The problem is on a7 his knight is rather away from the king side when things hot up there.

If his Bd7 would be still left on the board f3-f4 is well met by Bd7-g4 and his Bg4 becomes a nuisance. This is another reason why I want the Bd7 out of the way. As played f3-f4 in fact more important in opening up the d1-h5 diagonal rather than the f file.

Here as black I want to prepare a battery on h2. This is my most likely plan while developing. My enemy is the Nc3 (not all that bad move after all) but I don't want to lose a tempo playing a6. So I plan to let him put the knight there to kick my bishop that will go to b8. After it I'll kick the kinght with a6 and he would have to retreat the knight and I am not losing a tempo. Moreover I'll have the queen in front of the battery and this implies a different way to attack (probably Ng4 that must be supported by h5 against the queen... a nice tactic play). The participation of white's dsb which this moves abilitates will help in stopping the nasty plan only if g3 is played to support Bf4 and accepting a weak kingside.

Now take into account black coud play c4 since white cannot take dxc4 or loses the queen to the rook after Bxh2+. Unfortunately black can't play c4 because of Bb6).
