That's because Joe saw this discovered check, to which, there was no way out.  But, Dwayne's decisive mistake was leaving his K exposed.  So, it was by not playing ...Ke8 or ...Kg8.  I think that ...Ke8 would've been better, as that's where the K started.  And, despite black's weakest pawn being removed from the board, he could've still connected the Rook and King.  Of course, it would take longer then castling, but it is still possible to do so, as I have.  And, then, he would be just fine.  By leaving his K open, however, it was over, at once.  With that being said, Joe stressed something important.  And, what he said is the moral of the story.  In it he said, ""See where my opponents K ends up?Never allow yourself to do this.Don't try to play fun games with me.It won't work.It won't be ""me""committing suicide with my Q sac,it will be you!Again,I am bent on serious destruction of your game and as serious as breathing air to live.Do not think for a picosecond that I am joking or not trying to play serious just because I sac my Q or other pieces!That is to help you out to survive with my handicap Q move!I am being merciful to you!Take advantage of that!Don't like it?Then leave the game on move #3 and never look back,don't continue to play!Playing dumb on purpose with no real plan of trying to win in a serious fashion like this guy with his K shuttling will only make me throw you in that lava pit faster!And then it will be ""me""looking down on your skeleton as i'm drinking that cool martini and smiling at you!Don't allow that to happen...kill me!I want you too!Then that will make me proud of you!""

The answer is that with a normal Spanish Opening I have, until I found out that it doesn't accomplish what I thought it did.  Since the only purpose was doubled pawns.  However, Jack took me off guard by playing it later, so my response is also trying to take him off guard.  Therefore, I decided to make that capture, at once.

It's very important to note, as he told when we were saying goodbye, that it took Mr. Stockel 10 minutes to find this move.  Thus, I should win easily.  How can white win?"
183,6,22,1Rd7,b'r4rk1/1ppRnppp/p1p5/2B1q3/5N2/6Q1/PP4PP/R5K1 b - -',"?? The logic behind that question is that I overlooked the right move.  And, when I did, Jack did his usual and embarrassed me in front of the other students.  He did this by going back the position right after the previous move (18...Qxe5) when the game was over, and then, asking the same question that I asked.  I am sure that his goal is not to embarrass people.  Instead, his goal is to teach his other students, as there is an important reason this mistake occurred and a lesson affiliated with it.  So, he wants his students to learn.  With that being said, the solution to the problem is 19.Bd4!  As now, with my Qg3 and DSB, I am threatening mate on g7.  Meanwhile, the Queen is threatened, and if Jack is to move that Q, he will get mated.  Of course, not moving it or bringing to f6 (which also prevents mate) will result in 20.BXQ winning the Queen for Bishop.  So, long and short, there would be no way for Jack to protect his Queen.  But, the reason I made this mistake is that, in the wrong context, I tried to apply what ION told me about short range tactics.  As there appears to be two attackers against one defender.  What I overlooked is that his Queen is on the same line as my DSB.  And, being that he captured the pawn which protected my Bc5, Jack can and will capture.  Thus, I am down a piece without compensation.  In part is because when Jack captures I will be in check.  There's even more then what it appears to be, though.  To make matters worse, as per what Ken has asked me before, besides this move, nothing else came into consideration.  The problem is what Jack directly stated to me.  Whereas it took him 10 minutes to find the previous move, it only took me 30 seconds to play this move.  That is exactly why Jack embarrassed me in front of the other students.  The idea was to teach them why you don't rush.  But, that is especially true for the tournament.   Instead of rushing, you should come close to or even use up your time (timeout, lose on time.)  What he told everyone and reemphasized to me is that you must take your time.  As rushing can and often does cause something like this to happen.  "

The other variation which I don't is not recapturing and playing 26.Kg2 (leaving me a R down to which things appeared safe.)  But, he'd mate the same way being 26...Qf1#  So, there's no way around it.  I saw that right after he captured.  Consequently, I resigned here.  As noted, when that happened, that's when Jack went back to what I should've played with the other students.  Then he reminded me of how important it was to take some time.  So, that was one of three morals to this game.  The other one is what Kenneth_fiore_3 has stressed in previous annotations which he directly stated with this game.  So, he told to remember that, ""When you see a good, look for something better.""  Remembering, though, what that ION said to sometimes play it when you see a good move, I mentioned why I thought it would work before realizing that the Queen was there.  That's when he said, ""Why bother with a piece.  Forget about it as you could've won.  Don't go for a piece when you can win the game.""  Out of the three morals, I'd say that the first one of taking your time is the most important one.  As this is what happened in some of my other games.  As I went much too fast to see that I could've won.   In fact, while we were saying good bye Jack told me that during those 10 minutes he said to himself that if I found the right move, I'd win.  And, if not, I'd lose, but he was hoping that I would find the winning move which didn't happen.  With that being said had I spent, not even one, but several (at least 5 minutes) I would've seen, and thus, played 19.Bd4!  After which, it would've been game over for Jack, at once."

I said that I was thinking about what happened when Perry played a bad move and allowed me to bring the Queen like this.  His response was, ""that's not going to work"", and I thought he was right because it shouldn't have..  What I was implying with Perry's move was the Domiano's Defense.  In the tournament game against Perry, I was white and he was black.  It started off with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6?! 3.Nxf6 exf6?? 4.Qh5 g6 5.Qxe5+ which allows white to win the Rook.  Well, after he asked me that, I thought that this variation might work and, as what I'm generally guilty of, got very comfortable and happy with my position.  That's because if black messes up, I will get the Rook and have a plan.  Luckily, it does work.  But, this move is a lot worse then the previous move.  His next move is a good example which turns it from just happy to Hope Chess where I hope that he won't see it which will allow me to achieve my goal.  It's also worth noting that after this move, while Jack looked at the game one more time, he didn't get involved any more because the remainder of his time was spent on the other game.   "

As I suggested a move that was bad, and stalhandske made me go by my suggestion and play that in her position so that I'd learn why it's bad.  Sure enough, as he would've won two pawns in a similar, and I'm keeping that in mind because I have not intention of allowing Ted to win back material."

The idea is not to throw away your advantage or win by underestimating your opponent.  Thus, despite being way ahead, I must be careful, and I am.  As right after this move, I see what Ted is planning to do and have every intention to stop it.  I start by taking his g pawn."

And, even when he gets my a5 pawn, he's just left with his K against my K+R+3 pawns.  Thus, there is no hope for him left.  That's because in addition to what I just said, I'm not going to give him a lucky break by allowing stalemate, if Ted decides to continue."
427,12,56,4Rc1,b'8/8/8/k7/5P2/8/6PP/2R3K1 b - -',"Right after this move, Ted resigned.  He implied that this was a lost position by admitting that there he has nothing left.  Had he not resigned, I would've played 47.Rb1 to keep his monarch confined to the a file.  Then, I would just keep pushing my f pawn until it promoted.  After the promotion, I would've checkmate on a8 with that promoted pawn.  Overall, I enjoyed how this game went, but it still shows that I need to work on my assessment.  This time, I gave Jack a ride to his house, as it was raining like cats and dogs.  But, while we were sitting and talking, Jack said that he was upset that I played 14.Nxe5  As first, one piece was hanging and then, I hung another.  Thus, I was too advanced to be making a mistake like that.  Well, he was wrong about my 14th move.  But, I made that very mistake on the 15th move.  Trying to treat it like a Domiano's Defense, left me with 2 pieces attacked.  I could and should've wound up the equivalent to a pawn down.  But, I got lucky that Ted blundered and allowed me to catch up on the game.  However, I'm gonna have to still work on my assessment as judging the position accurately is crucial.  A mistake has costed me multiple games, including two of my most recent games, both of which ended earlier today."

546,15,10,Be3,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P2b1/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',It is best for white to block with queen here. Allowing him to develop lsb when black exchanges queens. As for me I love the games where opponent blocks with a piece.
547,15,11,Bxf3,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P4/2N1Bb2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Exchange to double pawn him or gain the d4 pawn if he recaptures with queen.

550,15,14,Bd3,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/5q2/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Maybe I could've chosen a better square. His bishop develops with tempo on my queen.
551,15,15,Qh5,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Maybe queen d7 was better. But I wanted my queen to be out still and have diagonals to the queen side. Was anticipating him to castle queen side.
552,15,16,Qe2,b'r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R b KQkq -',Opponent heads towards queen side castling. He's way more developed than me. But his structure makes it a bit easier to anticipate his moves.
553,15,17,e6,b'r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R w KQkq -',Told myself I can wait until he plays his Knight to b5 to castle. Until then it's time to bring my other pieces out.

557,15,21,Nxd4,b'2kr2nr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/7q/1b1n4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/1K1R3R w - -',His Knight retreated and I thought this attack was a pawn up exchange.  It was too soon to attack. I should've developed my other Knight first. Nf6 or to e7 both look playable and then possibly centralised my h rook before launching my attack.
558,15,22,Rxd4,b'2k3nr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/7q/1b1r4/2NB1P2/PPP1QP1P/1K1R3R w - -',Take and take with a surprise to follow

563,15,27,1Qxa4,b'6nr/1kp2ppp/p3p3/7q/Q7/2P2P2/P1P2P1P/1K1R3R b - -',Goes forward with his plan now it's gonna be rough. Knight rook queen vs rook rook queen.
564,15,28,1Nf6,b'7r/1kp2ppp/p3pn2/7q/Q7/2P2P2/P1P2P1P/1K1R3R w - -',Develop my Knight.

570,15,34,2Qa5+,b'r7/2k2ppp/p1p1p3/Q2n3q/8/2P2P2/P1P2P1P/KR5R b - -',Probing my king. I think he's looking for ways to come down

572,15,36,2Ke7,b'r7/4kppp/p1p1p3/Q2n3q/8/2P2P2/P1P2P1P/KR1R4 w - -',At least the squares his queen has access too behind my pawn line are protected.
573,15,37,2c4,b'r7/4kppp/p1p1p3/Q2n3q/2P5/5P2/P1P2P1P/KR1R4 b - -',He finally plays c4 but without a pin and a way for his queen to come in. My Knight becomes deadly!
574,15,38,2Qe5+,b'r7/4kppp/p1p1p3/Q2nq3/2P5/5P2/P1P2P1P/KR1R4 w - -',If opponent blocks with c3 I have to capture the pawn with queen. It forces a queen exchange but my Knight forks the two rooks
575,15,39,2Rb2,b'r7/4kppp/p1p1p3/Q2nq3/2P5/5P2/PRP2P1P/K2R4 b - -',So he blocks with rook. I don't have to move my Knight yet.

580,15,44,2c5,b'1r6/4kppp/p3p3/2p1q3/1nP5/1Q3P2/PRP2P1P/K2R4 w - -',So I solidify my Knight 
581,15,45,3Qa4,b'1r6/4kppp/p3p3/2p1q3/QnP5/5P2/PRP2P1P/K2R4 b - -',Again queen move maybe he thought a3 was to slow. Or he loves that nice d7 square protected  By his rook
582,15,46,3Nd3,b'1r6/4kppp/p3p3/2p1q3/Q1P5/3n1P2/PRP2P1P/K2R4 w - -',But it allows triple pressure on the b rook. He can't capture Knight cause of mate threat and the queen no longer has safe access to the d7 square

As he plays different things, during those common openings and takes me off guard.  So, despite what I learned, as bad as it might sound, to me reality is that I need to expect the unexpected.  As looking into it, I think that one of the things that I did wrong with Ken, when tying the lesson about assessment and mobility, was not being ready off for getting taken off unfamiliar territory.

Tom is in check, and when he takes back, I can win material.  But, here is a good example, though, of how timing is important.  As I did consider 11.e5? first.  The idea is a fork which should win material.  But, with the B there, he would've been able to play 11...Bxe5, and taking on 12.Qxc6 would not have won the Queen do to his d7 pawn.  So, I would've exchanged Queen and been a pawn down.  And, the reason I mention this is up until about a week or two ago, I forgot just how important timing was.  It was off again in another game, but then ION said that timing was vital.  And, if I had played that a move or two later, it would've been good.  Same thing happened in Edna's game with which I coached and was her only commentator.  Her opponent made a terrible blunder and taken the B.  Had the opponent waited and attacked Edna's Queen first, it would've worked.  As from there, she'd be forced to retreat, with which her opponent would've gotten a free piece, and she'd be able to liquidate.  But, by capturing a move early, Edna was able and later on, delivered a checkmate.  I kept this in mind when making that decision, and thus, held off on that until the next move.  That's because with the B gone, black is in serious trouble.  At best, Tom will lose his N for a pawn.  That is, if he doesn't take back, but rather, retreats, which would allow me to play 13.exf6."

Forgetting that my Bc1 was not developed the idea was centralizing my Rook, whilst attacking his Queen.  But, with my B locked in that hope almost worked, as now, he would've equalized.  This is important because unlike here, if this were still the tournament, that would've been the final move.  And, it's not because there's not much time.  Instead, it's that once you've made that move, even if you see that it's a mistake, there's no going back.  Thus, I would've lost all of my advantage.  I'm only lucky here that it's not.  So, I took that move right once before he captured, so it was just before I saw what he was about.  That's when Tom reminded me to take my time which is what also needs work during the tournament.  The other move that I considered was hitting the Queen by bringing my Bc1 into play.  Problem is that I can't since that is keeping my b2 pawn protected.  It's also worth noting that for the obvious reason fianchettoing would be just as bad as Re1??, so that was not considered.  Not knowing what else to do, I decided to play it safe and protect my LSB.

However, this is another reminder of where timing is important.  In this case, it involves what bhidragon told me which is seeing the big picture.  Another way of saying it is seeing everything that's occurring on the board in order to figure out what the position demands.  The idea being is that Tom was threatening a checkmate on me.  So, if I had captured on f6, he would've played 16...Ng4  After which, there would have been no way to prevent 17...Qxh2#  Additionally, no good would've been attempting to prevent the same move with 18.h3??  As after 18...Qxh3 Tom has gotten back a pawn, and the threat is renewed in almost the same way that I saw with bhidragon.  Since after a blunder, he had a crushing attack which started with Qh3  And, I used that same strategy in two games afterwards, so I am familiar with the pattern.  Afterwards, I could still delay 19...Ng4 with this move, but after 19...Qxg3+ white is still busted in a winning position.  So, this move prevents that trouble, as Tom's N can't just come in.

In other words, there no need to promote or sac the Queen to do it.  However, I looked at it and it's even more then just winning the other rook which is also the reason behind it.  That's because I figured out that this is checkmate since Tom's back rank was unprotected.  I seized advantage of my opportunity and went for it.  It was an interesting game, but after Tom's double blunder early being a piece and then a Rook, I had the advantage and did not give it back.  In doing so, I was able to force the win.  But, what I learned here is that even with the win I still need to take my time.  That's because by moving too quickly, I almost gave up my advantage and allowed equalization being the general oversight where I almost blundered the R which would've happened in a tournament where there's no going back.  So, it is very important to be aware of that, as well as, remembering how important the timing is.  As the timing by one move made the difference between losing a pawn and getting a piece for pawn.  By holding off just one move, it worked out in my favor which is what allowed me to take advantage of the first blunder."

1016,28,10,a3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/3pP3/3Pn3/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',I could have captured the knight at e4 with my c3 knight but instead I moved pawn to a3.  This was done to stop black pinning my knight with his bishop.  I did not think about black moving his DB to h4 and attacking my pawn at f2 which was already attacked by black's e4 knight. I could have developed my knight to f3 which might have been the best move by me to avoid black using the h4 square to attack my king.

Black seems to have almost completed his opening with the development of the knight but is looking quite squashed and only really has access down the d8 to h4 diagonal.  White has the centre controlled at present.

Black's knight will find it hard to get out since he does not have any useful squares to  occupy.

1039,28,33,1Rfg1,b'2rq1r1k/1bp1nppB/p3p3/1p1pP2Q/3P1P2/P1P5/2P2P1P/R5RK b - -',White moves his rook to g1 in case black should move his knight to g6 then this could be captured.

The main ideas of this opening are: Black will generally be prepared to relinquish the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, Black often doubles White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralize White's attacking chances on the kingside. "

Given about the unnecessary fianchetto, that's not how I should feel.  But, I am the kind of person that feels more comfortable and happy about my position then I should.

About 50% lost, and there were a few where what should've been a loss was just a lucky win.  Ever since, I got into Yoga as I learned to accept wherever the journey takes me.  In this case, what the position demands.  But, I go the other way, feeling too comfortable and losing my way.  In fact, that's how I lost a piece so early in a team match and got a very lucky draw that I didn't deserve after thinking the same way against Ken in our second game which I lost.  In this case, it's ok to be happy as this move was a blunder.  As now, I'll continue to harass his Q which will allow me to win a piece.  But, in the future, I will have to be more careful with being happy or comfortable in the future as that has also negative affects on my play.  A perfect was my most recent loss.  After taking the B when Will threatened mate, I tried to force an exchange of Rooks, by attacking his R.  As I was happy and comfortable, but I shouldn't have been.  I thought that I'd gotten my way, but overlooked that the pawn next to it, which appeared to protect the other pawn was pinned.  After he took, Will was going to mate, before I resigned.  So, the idea is not to get nervous but finding the happy medium.

I'm a little surprised that Perry didn't resign here but not shocked.  That's because he is a novice, and ION told me that, as a general rule, the stronger players resign when you lose material.  But, the ones that aren't as strong will keep playing until it's almost mate.  And, I thought this way for a while, until a lesson with reversion.  And, were this someone of my strength or weaker, I'd probably stay in.  However, I would resign against someone much stronger, in this position."

The point is that Perry had nothing left, and he realized it.  But, what helped to do was the important lesson on mobility combined with what I learned about those N.  As I used to my N and moved it to different places.  In doing so, I had those dangerous checks which led to this position, with which, Perry resigned.
