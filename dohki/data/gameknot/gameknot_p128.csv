0,0,0,Bd6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This is a dubious defense but I can't find an immedite refutation.

3,0,3,2f4,b'2r1k3/5p2/p1Nb1p1p/2pPpPr1/1p3P2/1P5P/P5P1/R3R2K b - f3',Much better here was b5. I didn't even realise that I had given up a pawn.
4,0,4,Rxf4,b'2r1k3/5p2/p1Nb1p1p/2pPp3/1p3r2/1P5P/P5P1/3RR2K w - -',ANd there goes another.
5,0,5,4Kf4,b'8/5p2/p4k1p/2p5/1p1b1K2/1P2p2P/P3R3/8 b - -',I attempt to queen my pawn.
6,0,6,Kd3,b'8/2b5/6KP/p7/1p6/1Ppk4/P3R3/8 w - -',Better was to keep the rook on the e file to prevent the bishop to mvoe to e5.
7,0,7,Kd2,b'8/7P/6K1/p3b3/1p6/1P6/P1pk4/6R1 w - -',I resigned here because it is easily won for black. He can give up the bishop for me pawn and then he could play c1.  If I try to check him once he gets his king to b1 the game is lost.
8,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This my first annotation so let me know if I use the wrong name or terminology somewhere. I have been playing this opening for a year now and am getting comfortable with it
9,1,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',I prefer Bc4 over Bd5 because black will want to play c6 sometime anyways. It does keep him from play Nc6 but it gives him opportunity to quickly put pressure on my king with Qa5
10,1,2,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq f6',"I think this is called a gambit of some kind. I could take blacks chance of castling by playing Bxg8 but after Rxg8 I either play exf5 and black get first jump at occupying center or I could play a knight forward probably Nc3 and then have 2 pawns to contend with. I think white could take center but it wouldn't be as easy as it looks.
 I could play Nc3 but if black would play f4 I'll be fighting these pawns for awhile. 
 Nf3 might not be a bad move. 3.Nf3 fxe4 4.Nxe5 would leave white looking pretty good right now.
 Qh5+ would be an OK move also I think. Black kings side would be very open."
11,1,3,exf5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',But what stick out gets taken. I think this is called gambit accepted.
12,1,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',black is taking control of center
13,1,5,Ne2,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I think Nc3 would have been a better move. Ne2 is looking at d4 and f4 but it cuts off my bishops retreat.
14,1,6,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3ppP2/2B5/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',I thinks this is a good move for black it puts pressure on my bishop and the pawn is solidly backed up by the knight and queen
15,1,7,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3ppP2/8/3B4/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I pulled back to defend f5 but I think Bb3 would have been a better move keeping an eyeball on blacks back rank.
16,1,8,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p1P2/4p3/3B4/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',why not? he's reinforced by d5 and Nf6
17,1,9,Bb5+,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/1B1p1P2/4p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',what else could I do? If I had played 4.Nc3 instead of 4.N32 I'd have a few more options then I do now but nothing great even then. I could play Ba6 and black would have either double pawns or a knight on the A file. But blacks center pawns are on white I want to keep my white bishop.
18,1,10,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/1B1p1P2/4p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',and the chase is on
19,1,11,Bxf5,b'rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1b2/B3p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',here we sitblack dominating the board although he has opened his pawns up a bit. And white has a closed rank with a lonley bishop out there (is this called a hung bishop?)
20,1,12,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1b2/B3p3/7P/PPPPNPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',this seems like a week move but I played it to put pressure on g4. I considered 8.Nf4 but didn't like the looks of 8...Bd6 9.d3 exd3 10. Nxd3. And I didn't like 8.Nd4 because of 8...Bg4. I think Nbc3 or 0-0 would have been better a better move. I would probably go with Nbc3 if I were to this position.
21,1,13,Bd6,b'rn1qk2r/pp4pp/2pb1n2/3p1b2/B3p3/7P/PPPPNPP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',black is controlling more of center. Would Bc5 have been a better move?
22,1,14,Nd4,b'rn1qk2r/pp4pp/2pb1n2/3p1b2/B2Np3/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',OK i'm stepping into center. Threatening bishop on f5 and c6 is pinned.
23,1,15,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',c6 is no longer pinned. If black moves c5 I'm in trouble.
24,1,16,1Nc3,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',a4 is supported and I'm putting pressure on center.
25,1,17,1O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Black castles while he has the chance. Something I should have done also.
26,1,18,1d3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I should have castled here but I didn't. This gives me a chance to see what kind of player I'm against. I know that he doesn't take a piece as soon as it's available and if he plays e3 a very bad move in my opinion I would try to exploit his weakness for passing pieces or always advancing.
27,1,19,1Qxd3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2N4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',that played as i figured it would with my queen now adding support to center and my queen and dark bishop cutting a nice diagonal. But now I have a glaring problem with my e file.
28,1,20,1b5,b'rn1q1rk1/p2b2pp/2pb1n2/1p1p4/B2N4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ b6',the start of the b c and d pawns advance.

30,1,22,1Nce2,b'rn1q1rk1/p2b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/1p1N4/1B1Q3P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I had been developing on the empty space on a b and c file but I thinks it's time to move over to kings side and see if I can get my pawns to hold queen side.
31,1,23,1c5,b'rn1q1rk1/p2b2pp/3b1n2/2pp4/1p1N4/1B1Q3P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I have to admire the way Ion worked these 3 pawns

33,1,25,1Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bbn2/2pp4/1p6/1B1Q1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I'm not sure why he moved here. I would think that a5 or Qe8 would have been better....but the white bishop on b3 is staring at blacks king.
34,1,26,1c4,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bbn2/2pp4/1pP5/1B1Q1N1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ c3',I have the advantage on the fight over c4 and if it goes to check 16.c4 dxc4 17.Bxc4 Bxc3 18.Qxc4+ I will have a chance to castle.
35,1,27,1bxc3e.p.,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bbn2/2pp4/8/1BpQ1N1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I forgot about en-passent!!
36,1,28,1Qxc3,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bbn2/2pp4/8/1BQ2N1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I took with the queen because of my bishop/queen split and to keep my ab pawns together
37,1,29,1Ne4,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bb3/2pp4/4n3/1BQ2N1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',black is firmly entrenched in center now.
38,1,30,1Qe3,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bb3/2pp4/4n3/1B2QN1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',c2 or e3 I'll take e3 again leaning towards kings side. Although the queen side has opened up more then I thought it would.
39,1,31,1c4,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bb3/3p4/2p1n3/1B2QN1P/PP2NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',and here comes the c pawn again.
40,1,32,1Bc2,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/3bb3/3p4/2p1n3/4QN1P/PPB1NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',again falling back while looking at the kings side. Would Ba4 have been a better move?....i don't think so. I do wonder how this would have played out though 19.0-0 cxb3 20.axb3....I don't like the looks of the islands but my rook would have the a file to play on.
41,1,33,1Bc5,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/4b3/2bp4/2p1n3/4QN1P/PPB1NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I keep finding myself in a position with subtle pressure applied. Something i need to remember to look for in my games
42,1,34,2Ned4,b'rn1q1rk1/p5pp/4b3/2bp4/2pNn3/4QN1P/PPB2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The fight over center has begun. Ned4 protects my queen while putting pressure on e6 BUT I'll have to move my queen first.

44,1,36,2Bxe4,b'r2q1rk1/p5pp/2n1b3/2bp4/2pNB3/4QN1P/PP3PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',The computer analysis says that Nxe6 would have been a better move but with my king out there and the force that black has out right now I think it would have been a fine line to walk trying to protect my queen and king. 
45,1,37,2Nxe6,b'r2q1rk1/p5pp/2n1N3/2b5/2p1p3/4QN1P/PP3PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',well ok I will play Nxe6 I would have preferred to wait one more move. Also I would of rather Nc6 and creating an unbalance but thought that I might end up losing my knight so I'll threaten blacks queen and rook
46,1,38,2Nxd8,b'r2N1rk1/p5pp/2n5/8/2p1p3/4bN1P/PP3PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ -',and there's the exchange.
47,1,39,2Bxf2+,b'r2N1rk1/p5pp/2n5/8/2p1p3/5N1P/PP3bP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',there goes my chance of castling. 
48,1,40,2Ke2,b'r2N1rk1/p5pp/2n5/8/2p1p3/5N1P/PP2KbP1/R1B4R b - -',And here was my mistake. The reason I didn't take the bishop was because I didn't like the looks of. 24.Kxf2 Nd4 25.Nd7 exf3 26.gxf3 Rxf3+ 27.Kg2 Raf8. I'm still not sure what the best move here is.
49,1,41,2Kxf2,b'3r1rk1/p5pp/2n5/8/2p5/5P1P/PP3K2/R1B4R b - -',so now the pieces are taken. I should be concentrating on getting my rooks developed

52,1,44,2Raf1,b'6k1/p5pp/3r4/8/2pn4/5r1P/PP1B2K1/5R1R b - -',I think Bc3 or Bb4 would have been better

55,1,47,3Rf1,b'6k1/p5pp/6r1/8/1Bpn4/6rP/PP5K/5R2 b - -',get the rook out of there because of Nf3#
56,1,48,3Kh1,b'6k1/p5pp/6r1/8/1Bp5/5nrP/PP6/5R1K b - -',the game is over so I moved here thinking black would play Rxh3# but instead we went for one more move.

When you look at your position do you think after playing every move that you have covered all bases.  Think again because yet again Henry and I end up being conquered by a Master with a rating north of 2300.  This time it is against my buddy Dave Rundle.  How did this happen?  Well the title gives you a clue!  You can also follow gameknot analysis as follows:-   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902271&rnd=0.048996459985547636        Back to the game - I start off with a rarity by my standards - 1. c4 which is the English Opening."
59,2,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3. .... Nf6 - development.

If Dave castles kingside there are thoughts of the possibility of Glenda hopping on her broomstick onto that very square if Dave is unaware!

I really did want to keep Glenda on that diagonal and I did not want Dave's lsb to get complete control of the b1-h7 diagonal.

This piece happens to be the pawn on f2 which is defending both Fou Lenoir and the pawn on g3.  I have to recapture but the pawn on g3 is hanging to deadly effect.

Generally the 6.e5 move is quite usual when playing the KID because if white exchange the pawns then you can exchange queens and get a pretty descent game with black. But now that the bishop blocks the d line I think a move like Nbd7 would have been really better.
89,4,4,Nxe5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4N3/2P1P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',! Well done. It doesn't look to have an immediate way to get back that pawn. The bishop and the knight protect the e pawn.

95,4,10,Nxd3,b'r2qr1k1/ppp2pbp/5np1/6B1/2P1P3/2Nn2Q1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! Qxd3 would have been much better.

I think whatever white do black can keep his advantage. If 16.Rxd3 Bxc3(if Rxg3 then Be5) 17.bxc3 Nxe2+ 18.Kf1 Nf4! This way my knight threat his rook while my rooks threat his bishop."
100,4,15,1Bxc7,b'r3r1k1/ppB2pbp/6p1/8/2P1P3/2Nn2n1/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',? Chose to moving out. 16.Rxd3 Bxc3 17.bxc3 was the only way to equalize.
101,4,16,1Nxb2,b'r3r1k1/ppB2pbp/6p1/8/2P1P3/2N3n1/Pn3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',! Now I keep the advantage more easily! if hxg3 then Nxd1 then the bishop can get the knight or the rook. If Rc1 then Bxc3 Rxc3 Ne2+ Kf1 Nxc3. Finally white resigns. I think there's a lot of things to study with this game.

198,9,5,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I develop my Bishop with a check to propose Bishop exchanging Knight pinning or to force him to lift up a pawn. The real intentions behind my move is to make way for early kingside castle.
199,9,6,Bd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',He says it's gonna be Bishop's exchange.
200,9,7,Bxd2+,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1bPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',I go for it with a check.
201,9,8,Nbxd2,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',He recaptures.
202,9,9,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',And then I castle. I'm ready to go ballistic now.
203,9,10,e4,b'rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ e3',He totally wants to control the center.
204,9,11,c6,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',I lift up c pawn to prepare d5. When I do we'll know if it is going to be a very closed position or a very open one... My guesses at this moment are it's going to be a closed one coz he's more likely to play e5 to challenge my knight.
205,9,12,Bd3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',He prepares his castling by developing his kingside bishop.
206,9,13,d5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ d6',I do my move. I am expecting him to play e5 so the position will become closed in the center.
207,9,14,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3pP3/2PP4/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',So he does he couldn't miss the chance to advance a pawn while also challenging my knight.
208,9,15,Nfd7,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/2PP4/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',Not many good places for my knight so I retract it to d7. The idea is to reinforce f6 coz I'm planning to play f5 at some point to disrupt his potential attack on my weak h7 position. If he captures en-passant with e-pawn then capturing with Nxf6 will reinforce h7.
209,9,16,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/2PP4/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He castles.

211,9,18,1c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1p2p/2PpP3/3P4/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He decides he's gonna keep totally closed the center.
212,9,19,1f5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1n2p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp2/3P4/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6',I do my move if he captures en-passant I'll develop my knight and will have myself an open controlled file. If he doesn't I'll totally disable any diagonal attacks on my h7 position. If he wants to break it he'll have to use his castle g pawn.
213,9,20,1a3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp1n2p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp2/3P4/P2B1N2/1P1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He didn't capture en-passant so I have a good closed position. He plays a3 my guesses at this point is he's planning to keep a good pawns structure and see if it will be totally closed in this side of the board too or if it will become open.
214,9,21,1b5,b'rnbq1rk1/p2n2p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/3P4/P2B1N2/1P1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - b6',I play b5. The idea is either we both keep a good pawn structure in that side too or I'll use a-pawn to capture en-passant and get myself an open a-file.
215,9,22,1b4,b'rnbq1rk1/p2n2p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/1P1P4/P2B1N2/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - b3',He decides not to open the position yet but to reinforce his pawn's structure.

217,9,24,1bxa5,b'rnbq1rk1/3n2p1/2p1p2p/PpPpPp2/3P4/P2B1N2/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He does capture.

219,9,26,1Nb3,b'rnb2rk1/3n2p1/2p1p2p/qpPpPp2/3P4/PN1B1N2/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He challenges my queen with his knight.

221,9,28,1Nh4,b'rnb2rk1/2qn2p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/3P3N/PN1B4/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Of course nothing prevents his knight from playing Nh4 anymore so he does. He now starts his siege on the g6 spot.
222,9,29,1Rf7,b'rnb3k1/2qn1rp1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/3P3N/PN1B4/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I know I have to make a good defense in both g7 and g6 so I start by reinforcing g7 with my rock.
223,9,30,1Be2,b'rnb3k1/2qn1rp1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/3P3N/PN6/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He doesn't like it of course he plays now Be2 to bring him to h5.
224,9,31,1Nf8,b'rnb2nk1/2q2rp1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp2/3P3N/PN6/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',My rock has a free passage to get safely to e7 so I play Nf8 to reinforce g6 and to lure his bishop to h5. His knight in h4 will make difficult a direct attack from his queen on e7 so my rock will be safe there for a while. Also in doing this I'm giving my bishop a chance to get to e8 and after that my b knight to d7. At that point I will have a very good defended position.
225,9,32,1Bh5,b'rnb2nk1/2q2rp1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/PN6/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Of course he plays what I was expecting him to. Challenging my rock and also pressing more the g6 position.
226,9,33,1Re7,b'rnb2nk1/2q1r1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/PN6/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So I put my rock safely into e7. I keep defending the g7 position.
227,9,34,1Nc1,b'rnb2nk1/2q1r1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/P7/5PPP/R1NQ1RK1 b - -',His knight can of course make more damage at f4 to press the g6 point and to defend his h5 bishop. So he'll move it there through c1 and d3/e2.
228,9,35,1Bd7,b'rn3nk1/2qbr1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/P7/5PPP/R1NQ1RK1 w - -',Time to get my bishop to the action point. I move it to d7 first.
229,9,36,1Ne2,b'rn3nk1/2qbr1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/P7/4NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',His knight continues his journey to f4.
230,9,37,1Be8,b'rn2bnk1/2q1r1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P3N/P7/4NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I challenge his bishop while also reinforcing g6. I know at this point g6 is going to be the pivot for his attack. Either he takes the bishop or he will take a chance to reinforce the bishop and continue his siege with Nf4.
231,9,38,2Nf4,b'rn2bnk1/2q1r1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P1N1N/P7/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He does reinforce the bishop.
232,9,39,2Nbd7,b'r3bnk1/2qnr1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/3P1N1N/P7/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',And this is one of the 3 best moves in the game for me. I will need at some point get use my f knight to attack his knight at g6 by then he'll probably have mating chances with his queen in g file so I'll need immediate back-up in g6 and h7 by replacing my f8 knight with the d7 one. This will save my ass in 2 ocassions later on.
233,9,40,2a4,b'r3bnk1/2qnr1p1/2p1p2p/1pPpPp1B/P2P1N1N/8/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',He decides he's gonna bring his queen into action by forcing me to do a capture or to pass my pawn.
234,9,41,2b4,b'r3bnk1/2qnr1p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp1B/Pp1P1N1N/8/5PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I decide I'll pass the pawn. This little pawn will be useful later on.
235,9,42,2Qb3,b'r3bnk1/2qnr1p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp1B/Pp1P1N1N/1Q6/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He plays a double attack first he challenges my passed pawn and second he challenges to take his queen to g file where his full brute force attack will take place.
236,9,43,2Qa5,b'r3bnk1/3nr1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1B/Pp1P1N1N/1Q6/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I take my queen to a5 to defend my b-pawn and keep his a-pawn from advancing any further.
237,9,44,2Qg3,b'r3bnk1/3nr1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1B/Pp1P1N1N/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Queen to g file... He's about to infiltrate my position by sieging from g6. 4 attackers 2 defenders... Not looking any good for me.
238,9,45,2Bxh5,b'r4nk1/3nr1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1b/Pp1P1N1N/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',But then I play Bxh5... This is the second one of the best moves I played in this game. In a single move I decreased the unbalanced 4 attackers / 2 defenders position to 2 attackers / 1 defender. He just lost the bishop. If he's going to keep the siege on g6 nevertheless I'll just use the bishop he didn't capture to do yet another capture for myself so I'd lose control of g6 but he'd have lost a whole piece in a failed attack. He can't afford that of course And besides he needs to place a knight in h5 to exploit the pinned g-pawn with Nf6+ and do severe mating threats in h7. So he must capture the bishop with the knight.
239,9,46,2Nxh5,b'r4nk1/3nr1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P3N/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He does capture. Now all he has to do is playing safely the sequence Qg6 Nf6+ Qh7#. But my knight is still on his way. At least that's the plan.
240,9,47,2Rb8,b'1r3nk1/3nr1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P3N/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"There's nothing I can do but waiting for him to start the exchanges in g6 so I take this chance to make my b pawn a yet greater threat by following the principle ""Rocks belong behind passed pawns""."
241,9,48,2Ng6,b'1r3nk1/3nr1p1/2p1p1Np/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P4/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Showtime... he begins his mating plan. There's 2 ways to deflect his plans. One is passive moving my rock to f7 to get her off knight's range waiting him to capture my knight and recapturing with my other knight but then I leave myself open to possible sacrifices on his side with his h knight to weaken up my already weak castle position which probably will become real nasty once he takes his rocks to h3 or g3. No there's a safer way to neutralize the attack. I must capture the knight.
242,9,49,2Nxg6,b'1r4k1/3nr1p1/2p1p1np/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P4/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I capture the knight. My calculations say he will recapture with queen no check no threats on any other of my hanging pieces so I'll have a free time to bring my d-knight to f8 again. Making unprofitable his playing Nf6+ coz after I play Kh8 both his queen and knight will be en-prise there is no more a mating chance in h7 and he'd have to retract his queen losing the knight.
243,9,50,2Qxg6,b'1r4k1/3nr1p1/2p1p1Qp/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P4/8/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He captures the knight. He's one move away from mating me (well 2. but since 1 is a check (Nf6+) it's a forced variation so I use to view them as a single move).
244,9,51,2Nf8,b'1r3nk1/4r1p1/2p1p1Qp/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P4/8/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',And by playing this I both challenge his queen and avoid mate in h7. He must retreat.
245,9,52,2Qg3,b'1r3nk1/4r1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1N/Pp1P4/6Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So he does.
246,9,53,2b3,b'1r3nk1/4r1p1/2p1p2p/q1PpPp1N/P2P4/1p4Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I get my pawn one square closer to promotion.
247,9,54,2Nf6+,b'1r3nk1/4r1p1/2p1pN1p/q1PpPp2/P2P4/1p4Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',He plays Nf6+. I think he was expecting me to play Kf7 so in a distraction I'd fail to Nf5 Qxf7+ Qxh6. But well there's only a move that will get me rid of his stubborn siege while also unpinning my g pawn to put his knight en-prise Kh8.
248,9,55,2Kh8,b'1r3n1k/4r1p1/2p1pN1p/q1PpPp2/P2P4/1p4Q1/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I play Kh8. Now his knight is en-prise.

256,9,63,3Reb7,b'1r3n1k/1r4p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp1N/1q1P4/4Q3/1p3PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',I reinforce the passed pawn.

262,9,69,3Rb7b3,b'1r3n1k/6p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp2/3P3P/1rqNQ3/1p3PP1/1R3RK1 w - -',I play Rb3 his knight is now en-prise.

265,9,72,3f3,b'1r3n1k/6p1/2p1p2p/2PpPp2/3P3P/1r1NQP2/1pq3P1/1R1R2K1 b - -',He plays f3... He failed to properly keep me from exchanging my queen and passed pawn for both of his rocks.

My passed pawn was under too much pressure anyways I'd lose the chance to do bigger things if I just backed him up all I could and he'd end up winning it. Better do something to remove more pieces in the game and leaving myself a better position. His king is very far from being safe so once I've dealt with his rocks I'll stand a better chance.

432,15,0,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I like this move because it's not very well known and it has almost the exact same motives as 1. e4. This move develops a piece and attacks two central squares albeit it does not open lines for pieces. I play this move when I want to play aggressively because I can't hope to play this move after 1. e4 when I am allured into playing 2. Nf3.
433,15,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is the move I wanted. It is perfectly playable as it does the same things as White's e4 but it's on Black's side. I wanted to play the Vienna Gambit this game so my next move was played accordingly.
434,15,2,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',This move prevents any further advances of the e5 pawn blocks access to 2. ...d5 and opens lines for my bishop and queen if it should be necessary. I also have the standard Vienna Gambit position. My next move will be f4 regardless of most reasonable enemy moves.
435,15,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This move attacks the white e4 pawn and develops a piece. I personally prefer 2. ...Nc6 as it frees up the f7 pawn that might make a difference in the game. 
436,15,4,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',This move tears open the center with a side pawn in exchange for a weakened king-side. This is an aggressive move but it's not as aggressive as the King's Gambit. The goal of this is to make a long-term queen-side attack or a short-term king-side attack. There are so many lines to this opening and the King's Gambit that there are thousands of books made for the opening in question but nobody I know has analyzed both of these openings.
437,15,5,exf4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This is accepting the gambit. Black hopes to remain up a pawn the entire game but sacrifices his center-pawn. Other decline variations are possible including 2. ...d6 (not very good) 2. ...d5 (may be good) and 2. ...Nc6.
438,15,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I play this move because it is like the King's Gambit. In that opening Black cannot play Qh4+ but this move right now prevents moving the pawn to g5 in order to protect the pawn. Alternative variations include d3 d4 or Bc4.
439,15,7,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This move was likely played to undermine the e4 pawn. I do not recommend it as it blocks the bishop from moving and does not make any attempt to develop pieces.
440,15,8,e5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I didn't want to move my queen to e2 because it would block the bishop. I also didn't want to play d3 as it would block the bishop as welland I also wanted to play d4 later in the game. I played e5 to attack the knight. Black still has the pin on my king.
441,15,9,d6,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black wants to further undermine the e-pawn. Nc6 would have also worked but this gives a line for the bishop to pin the knight and queen.
442,15,10,Qe2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',If I had played d4 a pawn exchange would have left me in an uncertain position. By that I mean I wouldn't have been confident in my play at that point. This move alleviates the pin and will also offer a queen exchange should I capture on d6.
443,15,11,Nc6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',This was a mistake. Black forgot about his knight on f6 because he became too entranced with my e-pawn. At least he got it out of the way! A better move would have been possibly Nd7 Ng5 or dxe5 but certainly not this.
444,15,12,exf6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1P2/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I capture the Trojan Horse and the Greeks are left without hope. I am up the exchange and it will be difficult for Black to retaliate at this point.
445,15,13,gxf6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1qp1p/2np1p2/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',I would have traded queens first and then recaptured. This would have reduced some tension on the board and would have created a more open position where my knights would not have done as well. Either way the pawns would be detrimental.
446,15,14,Nd5,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp1qp1p/2np1p2/3N4/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I attack with my knight to produce a quadruple fork. The best move at this point is to trade queens.
447,15,15,Qe6,b'r1b1kb1r/ppp2p1p/2npqp2/3N4/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',After this move Black resigned because of 9. Nxc7+ forcing Black to lose the queen. Personally I thought that this was a good game to become reacquainted to the opening. Beginners may learn from this game a stable offensive opening and to not make simple mistakes. Advanced players may have had some exposure to the opening after this game. Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed this annotation!

555,19,17,1Nd4,b'3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q2n4/2BN4/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3QRK1 b k -',So it is seems than the f pawn will be taken on e6 sooner or later. I looked for the circumstance it would have been less dangerous for black.

582,21,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Now I decide to start developing minor pieces so I transpose the King's Pawn Opening into the King's Knight opening.  I also wanted to capture his pawn but that was not the logic behind this move.
583,21,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Even though he does not play the Sicilian Defense this move is still studied by masters and grandmasters so this is !.  In fact Jack Stockel has told me that it is similar to the Sicilian Defense due to the position and that it is good to make a move that is studied by masters and grandmasters.  However there is a draw back with this candidate because his bishop is now blocked on f8 and it is his dominant bishop since it is black.  That is because he is also playing black and Jack Stockel has also said to me that ones dominant bishop is the same color that he or she is playing.
584,21,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This move is the proper continuation of the Ruy Lopez opening.

Instead I am only interested in castling for the continuation of the Ruy Lopez opening.  Therefore my judgment is ? in addition to my next move because it will enable him to capture a free pawn when 4. 0-0 Nxe4 are played.
586,21,6,Bd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Bp3/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I respond by boxing in his pawns on d6 and e5 and I also threaten to capture his knight with Bxe4.  This will force him to protect his knight but this move is ?.

In other words it will allow him to capture my dominant bishop for free when Nxd5 is played.  This is also where I have some cold-like symptoms.  It only gets worse from here.   
589,21,9,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/3np3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',In this position I could have played Bg5 and threatened to capture his queen Bxd8 but I did not want to do that because it would have been a wasted move.  If I had played Bg5 he probably would have played f6 and that would have forced me to move my bishop away from danger.  Therefore I play Nc3 but this is not the best either.  In fact it was ? because I will have two bad pawns on the c file when Nxc3 and bxc3 are played.

I think that he overreacted and thought I didn't lose my queen and that he lost the center but even though you lose the center it doesn't mean that you'll lose the game without a doubt.

My opponent Master Chrisobee kindly invited me to take part in his MT called Amor Vincit Omnia ( Love conquers all).  Sadly here the only thing that got conquered was Henry!  I expect you are wondering what the title of this annotation means.  Well it means accept your opponent's undefended material with caution especially when you are playing against an Expert or a Master.  It is true that even GMs blunder (remember Messrs Nigel Short and Victor Korchnoi both blundered into mate in one - this was covered into Amatzia Avni's Danger in Chess) but it is RARE!  Nine times out of 10 if you take the offering your opponent will either regain the sacrificed material with interest or like me you could cop Old Matey!  How did this happen?  Well here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902121&rnd=0.25633523027782023."
683,25,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',2. Bc4 - after a double king pawn opening we get this move.  It is called The Bishop's Opening because the bishop comes out before the knight.  It can transpose into several openings The Vienna Guicco Piano and even as in our game the Ruy Lopez.
684,25,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',3. ..... Nc6 - out come two black steeds.

686,25,4,c3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - -',7...... c3 - Chris decided to advance his pawn to c3 rather than his knight.  Later on he will put the Wicked Witch of the West on that square (via d3) to disastrous effect for Yours Truly.
687,25,5,b5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/B3P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - b6',9. .... b5 - driving back Chris's lsb.
688,25,6,1Nf1,b'r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQRNK1 b - -',12. Nf1 - this position is gradually becoming like a middle game Lopez position.  Chris gave me the Lopez a few years ago and thumped me a few moves out of the DB.  I just hope I can improve on this.
689,25,7,h6,b'r1bqr1k1/4bpp1/p1np1n1p/1pp1p3/4P3/2PP1N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 w - -',13. ..... h6 - this move is fairly OK but this pawn will become fodder for Chris' dsb later on.
690,25,8,1d4,b'r1bqr1k1/4bpp1/p1np1n1p/1pp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 b - -',14. d4 - A pawn push.  Again this is a standard middlegame move in the Ruy Lopez.  This will result in a pawn trade which will open up the c column.
691,25,9,Bb7,b'r2qrbk1/1b3pp1/p1np1n1p/1p6/3NP3/6NP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - -',17. ..... Bb7 - rather than trade knights I decided to develop a piece Fou Leblanc to defend my c6 knight.  Chris initiates the trade because he sees that my d6 isolani is a bit of a weakie.
692,25,10,1Bf4,b'r2qrbk1/5pp1/p1bp1n1p/1p6/4PB2/6NP/PPB2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - -',19. Bf4 - of which he piles up on.

694,25,12,g6,b'3qrbk1/3r1p2/p1bp1npp/1p6/4PB2/3Q2NP/PPB2PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',21. ..... g6 - alas I find myself without a plan here and so I end up playing a move which is not a disaster at this stage but it will be a step towards perdition.
695,25,13,2Bb3,b'3qrbk1/3r1p2/p1bp1npp/1p6/4PB2/1B1Q2NP/PP3PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',22. Bb3 - pin and Fou Leblanc is en prise to a discovered attack so I move him back to b7.
696,25,14,Bc6,b'3qrb2/3r1pk1/p1bp1npp/1p6/P3PB2/1B1Q2NP/1P3PP1/3RR1K1 w - -',24. .... Bc6 - if PxP?? then BxP skewering the rooks on d7 and e8.

698,25,16,axb3,b'q3rb2/3r1p2/p1bp1Qpk/8/4P3/1p4NP/1P3PP1/2R1R1K1 w - -',28. ..... axb3??? - here after a series of exchanges I decided to grab the bishop on b3.  This turned out to be fatal for Henry although if I did not take the bishop then Gameknot Analysis' suggested alternative would have left Chris with a clear pawn up in a rook ending and an overall advantage in excess of +2 which against an opponent of that calibre is I believe sufficient grounds for resignation due to ruinous loss of material.  But as Master Freddy would say even with a material deficit there is hope whereas if you resign or cop Old Matey there is none.
699,25,17,2Qh8+,b'q3rb1Q/3r1p2/p1bp2pk/8/4P3/1p4NP/1P3PP1/2R1R1K1 b - -',29. Qh8+ - this does lead to a spectacular king hunt however.

703,26,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was a short game that was played between me and Kartal_ist. It was such ashame that he timed out as I would learn a valuable lesson on playing the open Sicilian regarless of the outcome.
704,26,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I was expecting d6 but e6 is also fine.
705,26,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The Taimanov variation. 
706,26,3,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',I would prefer Qc7 or a6 here.

710,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I played the King's Gambit this game and unlike the other game that I annotated this one was a win for me. The usual move takes control of the center and opens lines for the bishop and queen and typing this every game I annotate becomes more and more meaningless so I try to truncate this every now and then.
711,27,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Black replies with a classic. Truncating once again this move refutes my center control and opens lines for his pieces.
712,27,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',This is the King's Gambit. Many games of this aggressive nature end fairly quickly and are rarely played out until the endgame. White sacrifices a king-side pawn in hope for a quick initiative and a rushed assault. In return Black gets the pawn. I like the Vienna Gambit because it is generally less risky but I decided to try out a more uncommon opening. It should be noted that at the grand master level Black can quickly equalize by accepting the gambit and playing g5 later on if i remember correctly.
713,27,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Normally when declining the gambit people play d5 or Bc5 and less commonly d6 but 2. ...Nc6 is a convenience for me because it typifies the Vienna Gambit.
714,27,4,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',3. Nf3 is also a valid move but I chose this because it resembles a Vienna Gambit-like position. Another possible move is 3. Bc4. 3. d3 will block the f1-bishop from attacking f7 for a while.
715,27,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',This move is a very strange approach to the King's Gambit. If White plays 4. fxe5 I believe that Black has a problem to deal with.
716,27,6,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I did not think on this move and I decided to make a safe game. Again 4. fxe5 seems great in this position because after the dubious 4. ...Nxe4 5. Nxe4 Qh4+ 6. Ng3 and White is up the exchange.
717,27,7,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This would be a great time to accept the gambit but I am not experienced with the King's Gambit Declined so I would not know. 4. ...d5 seems sketchy. This move attempts to remove the guard of the e-pawn the knight.
718,27,8,d3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I quickly defend the pawn with another piece although I allow myself to get pinned. I view this as a mistake because Black can play d5 and threaten d4. Then again the e5 pawn is undefended and I might be able to play fxe5 to scare the knight and bring a distraction. After d4 the following move I can play Nxd4. I render my current move as faulty because I contradict what I said earlier about keeping the bishop locked in as well.
719,27,9,Bxc3+,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2bP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Personally I would have played 5. ...d5 and see where that would have taken me. This move benefits me as it gets rid of my negative imbalance and gets rid of his stronger bishop.
720,27,10,bxc3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2PP1N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The only logical move was played. I intended to control the same diagonal that his bishop lost when he traded it for a bad knight the last move.
721,27,11,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/2PP1N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black reinforces the e-pawn and blocks out that aforementioned diagonal. It's still not a waste to have it however.
722,27,12,Ba3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',If Black castles now I win a pawn using the pin I obtained the last move. After fxe5 Black will not recapture because of the pin. I feel that this move hinders Black's play.
723,27,13,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Well Black castles and I snatch a pawn. I might have captured the f-pawn and played d5 after d4. However after the subsequent e5 Ne4 leaves the knight in an uncomfortable square. 
724,27,14,fxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4P3/4P3/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I chase the knight off and win a pawn taking advantage of my pin on the pawn and rook. My next plan is to regather my pieces castle and further fortify the center.
725,27,15,Ng4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',This move threatens to recapture the pawn but it leaves the knight on a bad square if something is not done about it.
726,27,16,exd6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nP4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',I view this as a mistake of mine. Yes I do retain my pawn advantage but now My king is stuck between two semi-open files and the respective side is weak. I should have played d4 which creates a phenomenal central pawn structure and by that I mean unusual yet somehow strong.
727,27,17,cxd6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',The only instance move leaves the d-pawn isolated. 9. ...Ne3 would have only traded a piece which I would have wanted.

729,27,19,1Re8,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1PQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ -',Black attempts to pressure my pieces and pin my pawn to my king. I might have played the same thing as this slightly ameliorates Black's position by removing the pin.

732,27,22,1O-O,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2np4/4n3/4P3/B1PP1N2/P1PQB1PP/R4RK1 b - -',Box 1 contained the car and box 2 contained the goat but somehow I chose box 3 and chose the castle. None of the aforementioned moves were awful enough to be considered a goat but I would have preferred d4 over Nxe5 because it helps my pawn structure and gives more space at the cost of making the primary square e4.
733,27,23,1Nxf3+,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P3/B1PP1n2/P1PQB1PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black trades a piece I presume in fear of 13. d4. Maybe 12. ...d5 or something else would have been better.
734,27,24,1Bxf3,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P3/B1PP1B2/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 b - -',Capturing with the rook leads to Bg4 or Ne5 and when I played this move I likely was not in the mood to deal with threats. Recapturing with the g-pawn would have blocked my bishop and exposed my king I protected the move earlier.
735,27,25,1Ne5,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/3p4/4n3/4P3/B1PP1B2/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 w - -',Black does nothing to ameliorate his isolated d-pawn or develop his bishop. However I cannot play d4 now because Nc4 will cramp my position.
736,27,26,1Qf4,b'r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/3p4/4n3/4PQ2/B1PP1B2/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - -',I engage my queen and it's embarrassing to say that I do not remember why I played this move! I assume it was for a battery along the f-file and to play d4 but to me right now these seem like imaginary numbers. Anyway all moves are complex. Disregarding my horrible mathematical pun on the decimal number system my opponent timed out at this move. I would consider myself in an excellent position here. Beginners can learn from this game to fix their negative imbalances such as an isolated d-pawn and to not lose positive imbalances so easily such as the pin in the beginning of the game. Advanced players could have enjoyed exposure to an opening that may not be so clear-cut like the Ruy Lopez per say. I hope you enjoyed my annotation and have a nice day!

However by putting all of his pawns on black squares White has hampered the development of the c1 bishop and created multiple weaknesses in his position. At the same time Black has lost all activity and is forced to play passively.

As revealed later this is a terrible move that does not at all fit into the spirit of the Caro-Kann Defence. It weakens Black's pawn chain creates multiple weaknesses and loses the support of e6. White finds a way to successfully open the position and successfully take advantage of the mistake. 
766,29,22,2Nc5,b'1krq3r/1p2b1p1/p1n1pp2/2NpPnP1/1P1P1P2/P2Q1N2/1B4K1/2RR4 b - -',Instantly the knight jumps onto the strong outpost and takes advantage of the weak e6. This knight is much stronger than the one on f5.

775,29,31,3Kxh1,b'1k6/1p1q4/p1n3p1/3pPnN1/1P1P1P2/P2Q4/1B6/7K b - -',Let's examine the resulting endgame. White is a pawn up and has a bishop for a knight and a passed protected pawn on e5. Black however has a weak position and two isolated pawns on d5 and g6. It will take a lot of effort from Black to save the game. 
776,29,32,3Qe8,b'1k2q3/1p6/p1n3p1/3pPnN1/1P1P1P2/P2Q4/1B6/7K w - -',Hoping for some counterplay starting from Qh8+. White makes an interensing choice.

778,29,34,3Ncxd4,b'1k2q3/1p6/p5p1/3pPnN1/1P1n1P2/P6Q/1B6/7K w - -',Grabbing the chance to reclaim material Black instantly takes back the pawn. However this gives White an opportunity to finally trade off his useless bishop on b2.
779,29,35,3Qh7,b'1k2q3/1p5Q/p5p1/3pP1N1/1P1n1P2/P7/8/7K b - -',White's queen flanks Black's defences along the h-file and seems to create several aggressive threats. Now the best move for Black in this position is Ne6 which would have held the position to a possible draw. However Black gets greedy and goes on the offensive trying to get as much material as possible. 
780,29,36,3Nf7,b'1k2q3/1p3N1Q/p5p1/3pP3/1P3P2/P7/2n5/7K b - -',White's key move. It turns out that the g6 pawn falls and he emerges with two connected passed pawns creating a crushing threat to Black's position. Notice that moves such as Qe6 do not work because of Nd6 and Black cannot avoid mate without giving up the queen.

785,29,41,Qc6,b'k7/1p3N2/p1q1P3/1n1Q4/1P1p1P2/8/8/7K w - -',Another error. Black tries to free the game of queens and to promote his own pawns but his defence would work much better if there were queens on the board. This is a debatable decision so please comment if it is right or wrong. White is forced to trade. 
786,29,42,4e7,b'k7/4PN2/p1p5/1n6/1P1p1P2/8/8/7K b - -',The pawn charges forward and Black's knight takes a last stand to stop it from queening. 
787,29,43,4Ne5,b'k7/2n1P3/p1p5/4N3/1P1p1P2/8/8/7K b - -',The same goes for the White knight. Let's examine the endgame a second time. Material is even but White has one almost-passed pawn which will be sooner supported by the second. Black's knight cannot stop both pawns and his king is too far away. Black tries to create some desperate counterplay to save the game.

816,30,20,1Bxc6,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2Bb4/8/3P2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I believe that this exchange is a bit premature as you need to have pieces in order to mount an effective attack however it does break up my queenside pawns and they are now isolated so in and of itself that's not a bad thing.  Pawns are more valuable when they are connected and isolated they are weak.
817,30,21,1Qd3,b'r2q1rk1/p4ppp/2pb4/8/3P2b1/3Q1N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',This move is great but it is potentially dangerous if you don't follow through as I will show in a few moves.  White wants to relieve pressure on his knight and allow his queen to move freely.  This is good but if you want to take that step follow through and either protect your newly moved pieces and/or move your knight on to the g5 square for an attack on black's king.  Dangling pieces (protected by only air) can lead to very bad things if you're not careful.  Where possible it is always better to move pieces to a place where they are protected and/or have some support from a secondary piece.  A better move sequence instead of 13 Bxc6 would have been 13. Qd3 forcing me to 13... h6.

I thought that white was giving away his pawn for free as his queen cannot take or risk capture but doubling up my bishops with his potential for a rook/queen combo able to come online and it can be dangerous for me.

It does connect his rooks which is always a plus in development but it doesn't add much attack value with where he placed it.   More damning however it will also cost him his knight for free.  If he re-takes very bad things happen.

The better move here for white would have been to put the knight on g5 followed up by Rd1 breaking my chance to exchange with the knight and earning a bishop for the pawn I took on d5. (thanks kingcruel)"

If you go all the way back to move 14 I said that you don't leave pieces supported only by air.  If you do they can become a liability.  Here after retaking with his g pawn because his queen isn't supported it will now be exchanged for a bishop.  You have to be cognizant of a bishop's potential check because it can hurt if you aren't paying attention.

Strategically white wants to cement his central pawn advantage-->exchange pieces--> and finally head into a slightly better rook pawn ending. For black the winning ideas involve controlling d5 and e4. The strategic ideas for black are to 1. exchange LSB eliminating the bishop pair advantage 2. undermine whites control of e5 with ...c5 ...f6 or fighting for direct control of e5 with nd7 Qc7 and Bd6.

901,33,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I was able to fix the problems in the opening and then attack white's pawn chain which created some opportunities to create unbalances in the position that white didn't understand immediately and wasn't able to solve in due time so he eventually blundered which allowed me to gain decisive material

932,34,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a standard move for many players. Although not statistically significantly better than 1. d4 it is still a very strong move as it attacks two center squares and opens lines for pieces.
933,34,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This move is the second most played move next to 1. ...c5. It refutes my center control and opens lines for his pieces.
934,34,2,f4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq f3',This position is known as the King's Gambit. The goal of the opening is to get a long-term queen-side attack by removing Black's center pawn and having surplus pawns than the opponent. It is not very frequently played as the games are often too short and risky for class players and Black has a good chance of equalizing in grand master games.
935,34,3,exf4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black accepts the gambit and loses all control of the center for a while. However White's king-side is worsened and no pieces are developed. Likewise Black does not either. In order to make something out of the game White must attack ferociously or immediately recapture to compensate for the lost pawn.
936,34,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',If I remember I first saw this move being played not too long ago and White won in ten or so moves. After 3. ...Qh5 4. Kf1 the king is somewhat safe and Black has an out-standing queen in the sense that it is prematurely developed. For a player who is testing out the King's Gambit or in other words me I would recommend 3. Nf3 as a start.
937,34,5,h5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/7p/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq h6',The objective of this move was to prevent Qh5 which attacks f7 and puts the queen in an attacking position and start a king-side forward offense/defense. More typical is 3. ...g5 or a knight move. 3. ...Qh5 is also possible as an instance move.
938,34,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/7p/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Now I play Nf3 to prepare to castle. I should have played d3 or d4 but I wanted to attack to see how far I would get.
939,34,7,g5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/6pp/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq g6',This move makes it difficult to recapture on f4 and now the king-side is hard to break from the respective side. On the flip side Black is severely down in development and I have plenty chance to recuperate.
940,34,8,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/4N1pp/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',I targeted f7 without thinking about my move. I am not familiar with the main line but I think that d3 d4 or even h4 would have lead to a better game than did here.
941,34,9,Nh6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N1pp/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This move develops the knight and protects the f7 pawn albeit keeps the knight on the rim. The h5 pawn is now undefended.
942,34,10,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N1pp/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I played this move without thinking entranced by the opening rush. I overlooked Qxh5 which seems like a very strong move because it equalizes the gambit made earlier and undermines the f7 pawn with a pin.
943,34,11,Qe7,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqp2/7n/4N1pp/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The queen has to defend the attack; otherwise the game may as well be lost. The bishop  can fianchetto on g7 and have a strong diagonal. In all truth I would have played this move but Nc6 seems like a  good move to consider.
944,34,12,Qxh5,b'rnb1kb1r/ppppqp2/7n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I finally realize that I could have played this move and not much time is lost.
945,34,13,Qf6,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1p2/5q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',This was played to protect the rook should I play Nxf7. This way Black's knight can recapture. At this point my arrogance lead me to my downfall. I probably should have retreated here.
946,34,14,Nc3,b'rnb1kb1r/pppp1p2/5q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',My intentions with this move were to develop another piece and move it to d5 with a triple fork. At this point in the game I was making simple one-move threats hoping to get one to slide which is exactly how not to win a chess game. Retreating the queen to d1 or e2 would have been much better in my opinion.
947,34,15,c6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1p2/2p2q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This move protects against my meager threat.
948,34,16,g3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp1p1p2/2p2q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I wanted to attack at all costs. If Black accepts this gambit I would play Rf1 which will finally get to the f7 pawn.
949,34,17,d6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',This chases my knight away. I have no use for it if my rook gets on a semi-open f-file.
950,34,18,1gxf4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPP2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',I capture and get rid of one f-pawn. If black captures the knight I capture back with my f-pawn.
951,34,19,1gxf4,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N2Q/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',He captures my f-pawn and at this point I would prefer to be Black. My queen is overdeveloped and my pieces are too entwined within the enemy position and blocked from retreat by my own pieces.
952,34,20,1Nxf7,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3N2/2pp1q1n/7Q/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',No other move is better with the knight. I hoped to get a good game from this.
953,34,21,1Nxf7,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3n2/2pp1q2/7Q/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',As aforementioned Black can recapture with the knight and still be safe.
954,34,22,1Bxf7+,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3B2/2pp1q2/7Q/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',If Qxf7 12. ...Qxf7 13. Bxf7 Kxf7 leads me down the exchange. In addition my Bxf7 nullifies Qxf7 which now leaves the Black rook unattended.
955,34,23,1Kd8,b'rnbk1b1r/pp3B2/2pp1q2/7Q/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',A simple move is played. The only problem with this move is that Black is lost if a bishop somehow manages to get on g5.
956,34,24,1Qg6,b'rnbk1b1r/pp3B2/2pp1qQ1/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Any other move would have lost the bishop or queen. I offer a queen exchange and hope to remain up a pawn for the rest of the game.
957,34,25,1Bg7,b'rnbk3r/pp3Bb1/2pp1qQ1/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black wants to get a tempo after the exchange. Be7 may have worked just as well.
958,34,26,1Qxf6+,b'rnbk3r/pp3Bb1/2pp1Q2/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',I trade queens. There is not much to say here.
959,34,27,1Bxf6,b'rnbk3r/pp3B2/2pp1b2/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Black recaptures. I get thoughts that I may lose the pawn advantage and be left with a bad position. I would still prefer White but things look even more bleak on the king-side.
960,34,28,1Bxf4,b'rnbk3r/pp3B2/2pp1b2/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R b KQ -',I capture the f-pawn because I had no intention in keeping my d-pawn anymore. The attack is long gone and I wanted to get a peaceful endgame but the isolated e-pawn may have proved troublesome. It turned out to be bad because two undefended bishops on the same open file is seldom convenient.
961,34,29,1Bh4+,b'rnbk3r/pp3B2/2pp4/8/3PPB1b/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R w KQ -',Instead of capturing my pawn Black wants to skewer my bishops and dislocate my king. This move proved very troublesome because I could not protect with my bishop. After 16. Bg3 Bxg3 17. hxg3 Rxh1+ and I lose both rooks and may as well resign.
962,34,30,1Ke2,b'rnbk3r/pp3B2/2pp4/8/3PPB1b/2N5/PPP1K2P/R6R b - -',Kd2 would have worked but I wanted the luxury of knowing that I would be able to access d3 e3 and f3 at the same time.
963,34,31,1Rf8,b'rnbk1r2/pp3B2/2pp4/8/3PPB1b/2N5/PPP1K2P/R6R w - -',And here comes the skewer. As a matter of fact I noticed the skewer the move before.
964,34,32,1Raf1,b'rnbk1r2/pp3B2/2pp4/8/3PPB1b/2N5/PPP1K2P/5R1R b - -',I act with my corner rook to indirectly defend both pieces. If Black captures my bishop 18. Bg5+ wins it back. Unfortunately there was no stopping the capture.
965,34,33,1Bh3,b'rn1k1r2/pp3B2/2pp4/8/3PPB1b/2N4b/PPP1K2P/5R1R w - -',My rook has nowhere to go. Any move on the file will lose it. I didn't want to lose my bishop so I avoided moving my rook altogether.
966,34,34,1Bxd6,b'rn1k1r2/pp3B2/2pB4/8/3PP2b/2N4b/PPP1K2P/5R1R b - -',If Black captures my rook I recapture with my other rook and I am winning by two pawns. Black was smarter than this however.
967,34,35,1Rh8,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/8/3PP2b/2N4b/PPP1K2P/5R1R w - -',Black moves his rook to the only safe haven. At this point I would consider myself winning.
968,34,36,1Rf4,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/8/3PPR1b/2N4b/PPP1K2P/7R b - -',I didn't want to leave my beloved f-file which helped me win the game but I lose my advantage here. The Black bishops get a chew toy and make me suffer from this move on.
969,34,37,1Bg5,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/6b1/3PPR2/2N4b/PPP1K2P/7R w - -',This move forces my rook to move a second time but I have nowhere to go. I didn't want to draw the game so here comes mistake number 2.
970,34,38,2Rf5,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/5Rb1/3PP3/2N4b/PPP1K2P/7R b - -',Losing an advantage has never become easier. The new Rook Drop Toolkit is only 10 in any currency and you too can make your opponent a happier person. I never imagined this move to bring so much pain. If Black captures it makes winning the game much more difficult.
971,34,39,2Bg4+,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/5Rb1/3PP1b1/2N5/PPP1K2P/7R w - -',Black wants to move my king once again before capturing. Once again I did not want to draw.
972,34,40,2Kd3,b'rn1k3r/pp3B2/2pB4/5Rb1/3PP1b1/2NK4/PPP4P/7R b - -',I advance my king. My king's arrogance made me lose the game.
973,34,41,2Rh3+,b'rn1k4/pp3B2/2pB4/5Rb1/3PP1b1/2NK3r/PPP4P/7R w - -',Black attacks even more. At this point the game is still not decided.
974,34,42,2Kc4,b'rn1k4/pp3B2/2pB4/5Rb1/2KPP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R b - -',The only legal king move was played. Now that I think of it Bg3 would have been interesting.
975,34,43,2b5+,b'rn1k4/p4B2/2pB4/1p3Rb1/2KPP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R w - b6',Still attacking my king. Here is where I make the mistake. I should have played played Kb3 but my arrogance takes me too far. Somehow I thought that I would win this game but overlooked a simple move.
976,34,44,2Kc5,b'rn1k4/p4B2/2pB4/1pK2Rb1/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R b - -',The game is over from here. Either I lose my bishop or I get checkmated. There is nothing more gruesome than making a king walk and losing a game because of it. It worked for Nigel Short I believe!
977,34,45,2Kd7,b'rn6/p2k1B2/2pB4/1pK2Rb1/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R w - -',This was a move I did not notice in the game. If I capture the bishop on g5 then Na6# is played. If I play Kb4 then I lose my bishop via Kxd6 or rook via Bxf5. I captured the troublesome yet undeveloped knight.
978,34,46,2Bxb8,b'rB6/p2k1B2/2p5/1pK2Rb1/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R b - -',And here is the grand loss. I was expecting 24... Rxb8 25. Rxg5 and a winning game but I was foolish enough to overlook a two-move checkmate.
979,34,47,2Be7+,b'rB6/p2kbB2/2p5/1pK2R2/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R w - -',This was a fantastic move by Black. My king is trapped and my only possible move is Bd6.
980,34,48,2Bd6,b'r7/p2kbB2/2pB4/1pK2R2/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R b - -',I felt like resigning the move before but I never resign. There is always a chance. The probability may be 1/aleph-0 but there is still a chance.
981,34,49,2Bxd6#,b'r7/p2k1B2/2pb4/1pK2R2/3PP1b1/2N4r/PPP4P/7R w - -',And that is the game. I applaud my opponent for the spectacular game. Just as a note I did mention that I did not want to draw the game but no draws were offered for the duration of the game; what I meant was that I wanted to avoid threefold repetition because I was winning by three pawns and I expected that my opponent would want to draw. I believe that my fatal blunder was at move 23 but I could be wrong. Beginners may learn how to retaliate from a seemingly lost game Black in the beginning and White at the ending and to look at every possible move and search tree. Advanced players can learn from the opening because not many players that I know are familiar with it. In example I played the Vienna's Gambit against a USCF Candidate Master several months ago and I won due to the fact that he did not know the opening. Anyway thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed my annotation. I hope that we come face to face in a game and have a nice day!

After the game my opponent said that he couldn't decide between e5 and f5 and he eventually played e5 and he wasn't sure that this was right. I replied that I thought e5 was stronger but he made a mistake in not maintaining the pawn on e5 supporting it with Re1 and maybe Qe2 rather than exchanging it. I see on the Gameknot World database there is one game with e5 Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange… (2064) which ended in a draw and one with f5 Lalic Susan (2320) vs. Makropoulou Ma… (2305) which white won. However I still think e5 is stronger!

As I have two bishops I want to open up the position for my bishops. Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange… (2064) continued with 9......d5 but why head into a blocked position where his knights are better than my knight and bishop?
1013,36,17,d6,b'r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1npp1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',"The search engine ""Shredder"" now suggests 10. Ne4 as best for White with a slight advantage for white. I think the move he played was a mistake."

Now Qe7 is the obvious move keeping the c pawn protected but I thought that I wanted to prevent him from playing d4 so I played my queen back to d7. Shredder surprisingly suggests retreating to c7 and if 12. Nxc5 then Nd5 winning the pawn back on c2 with equality.
1017,36,21,1Qd7,b'r1b1k2r/1p1q1pbp/p1n1p1p1/2p5/4NP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Of course he can't take on c5 as I have a check on d4 which picks up the knight on c5.

I wanted to play R(a)d8 but was rather unhappy about the reply Nc4 so I eventually played my other rook over so as to meet Nc4 with R(a)b8 followed by b5. Shredder like Qa2 here
