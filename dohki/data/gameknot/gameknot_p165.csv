0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I started off with intentions to open up the d-file.
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',He responded with e5 a common opening move.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I protected my future pawn placement and began with a three or four knight opening.
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He protected the piece that I was threatening.
4,0,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',I stopped congestion of the queen. Best to get this out of the way for my future plans will need it. Also I threatened the pawn- now with 2 pieces. Not leaving my pawn en prise however.
5,0,5,exd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He took the bait...I mean piece...as I planned out my next move.
6,0,6,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I traded off and took his pawn in revenge.
7,0,7,Nxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',He then took my knight with his. It took me long to understand that at this point my queen could still attack him. It also helped my plan greatly.
8,0,8,Qxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',I took him without a second glance.
9,0,9,b6,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',He moved out. A move I saw coming. He was planning on taking me with his Dark Squared Bishop.
10,0,10,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/3QPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',I moved out my bishop to allow my rook an opening in case of instantaneous attack however my knight still stood in the way.
11,0,11,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2b5/3QPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq -',As if I predicted the future he attacked.
12,0,12,Qd2,b'r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2b5/4PB2/8/PPPQ1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',I easily defended staying off the back line to keep my plan intact.

14,0,14,Na3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/2b5/4PB2/N7/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I developed mine in return. Serving a double purpose also opening my rook. A better move would have been to develop towards the center however. Still though I opened outside taking the enemies DSB (dark squared bishop) out of play for the future.
15,0,15,Bxa3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/8/4PB2/b7/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Gone he performed a trade and it was off the board.
16,0,16,bxa3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p3n2/8/4PB2/P7/P1PQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I decided this would be okay. Although the b-file was open it was not going to be a large threat.
17,0,17,Nxe4,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/4nB2/P7/P1PQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',He put my queen in danger and I had to act.
18,0,18,1Qd3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/4nB2/P2Q4/P1P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Still remaining off the back line my plan was in motion. My next mission was to remove his d-pawn.
19,0,19,1Nc5,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2n5/5B2/P2Q4/P1P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',His knight threatening me yet again I was in danger.
20,0,20,1Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2n5/5B2/P7/P1PQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Back to the running block I returned to original position.
21,0,21,1Nb3,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/5B2/Pn6/P1PQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Forking my Rook and queen I knew i was in trouble.
22,0,22,1Rd1,b'r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p6/8/5B2/Pn6/P1PQ1PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq -',I pulled my rook in any other case a queen would be necessary however for this I needed that rook. 
23,0,23,1d5,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/1p6/3p4/5B2/Pn6/P1PQ1PPP/3RKB1R w Kkq d6',Crucial mistake not noticing. He pulled his d-pawn out.
24,0,24,1Bc4,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/1p6/3p4/2B2B2/Pn6/P1PQ1PPP/3RK2R b Kkq -',I threatened his knight actually in an attempt to move the d-pawn.
25,0,25,1dxc4,b'r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/1p6/8/2p2B2/Pn6/P1PQ1PPP/3RK2R w Kkq -',Blunder he took the bishop not the queen. Oblivious he lost himself the game.
26,0,26,1Qxd8#,b'r1bQk2r/p1p2ppp/1p6/8/2p2B2/Pn6/P1P2PPP/3RK2R b Kkq -',Checkmate. I took his unprotected queen and he had nowhere to go. Good game Millionaire if you had noticed that it would have gone differently. Good game. Thanks everyone hope you enjoyed. Stay tuned for the next one.
27,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I started out thinking about an irregular move-set. The Queen's Gambit.
28,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He began by developing his king-side knight.
29,1,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I continued my Gambit like moves and opened up my queen for development. 
30,1,3,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',He placed his protected pawn on d5. This allowed me to know he wanted a fast paced game.
31,1,4,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I took him offering a trade off.
32,1,5,Nxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He completed the trade but minimized his teams development.
33,1,6,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I threatened his knight with my king's pawn
34,1,7,Nb6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He moved away and both of us were still yet to develop.
35,1,8,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I began with a slight variation to a 3 knights defense.
36,1,9,h5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq h6',He moved out to offer a different game set in my opinion
37,1,10,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I stayed on the path to my three knights defense.
38,1,11,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He pinned my knight and queen.
39,1,12,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP1b1/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I forced him to take action livening up the pace.
40,1,13,Bxf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP3/2N2b1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He took my knight off my hands for a trade.
41,1,14,Qxf3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3PP3/2N2Q1P/PP3PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',I accepted the trade and developed my queen.
42,1,15,Qxd4,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3qP3/2N2Q1P/PP3PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',He took my pawn ruining my defense.
43,1,16,Be3,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n6/7p/3qP3/2N1BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I threatened his queen and pinned his knight.
44,1,17,Qf6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n3q2/7p/4P3/2N1BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',The queen nicely backed off. Ready at any moment for a queen's trade.
45,1,18,1Nb5,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1ppp1/1n3q2/1N5p/4P3/4BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I setup for a fork between his king and rook.
46,1,19,1Na6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1ppp1/nn3q2/1N5p/4P3/4BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',He further developed his pieces and the Queen's side of the board looked more like a stable.
47,1,20,1Bxb6,b'r3kb1r/ppp1ppp1/nB3q2/1N5p/4P3/5Q1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I took his knight with no further threat.
48,1,21,1Qxf3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1ppp1/nB6/1N5p/4P3/5q1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',He Traded of the queens evenly and I was ready for mate.
49,1,22,1gxf3,b'r3kb1r/ppp1ppp1/nB6/1N5p/4P3/5P1P/PP3P2/R3KB1R b KQkq -',I traded off. Devising my plan.
50,1,23,1axb6,b'r3kb1r/1pp1ppp1/np6/1N5p/4P3/5P1P/PP3P2/R3KB1R w KQkq -',He took my bishop and I decided to continue.
51,1,24,1Rd1,b'r3kb1r/1pp1ppp1/np6/1N5p/4P3/5P1P/PP3P2/3RKB1R b Kkq -',A well placed rook stopped his king from motion. That should have a been a sure sign of foresighted mate.
52,1,25,1c6,b'r3kb1r/1p2ppp1/npp5/1N5p/4P3/5P1P/PP3P2/3RKB1R w Kkq -',He threatened my knight. I was planning on allowing him to take it so that I could mate him.
53,1,26,1a4,b'r3kb1r/1p2ppp1/npp5/1N5p/P3P3/5P1P/1P3P2/3RKB1R b Kkq a3',I still protected though not seeming suspicious.
54,1,27,1cxb5,b'r3kb1r/1p2ppp1/np6/1p5p/P3P3/5P1P/1P3P2/3RKB1R w Kkq -',He took no mercy and my sacrifice was a completion. At this point it wouldn't make a difference what I lost.
55,1,28,1Bxb5#,b'r3kb1r/1p2ppp1/np6/1B5p/P3P3/5P1P/1P3P2/3RK2R b Kkq -',Mate. I killed his pawn for revenge and finished off the rest of that maniac. Good game CM. I hope to play again soon. Hope you enjoyed it Everybody. Thanks.
56,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"""Rosselsprung"" was the codename of a German naval operation in World War Two in which the battleship ""Tirpitz"" sortied to intercept an Allied arctic convoy.  The operation was a success for the Germans.  ""Rosselsprung"" refers to the knight's move in chess."
57,2,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',"I had no affinity with the ""Kriegsmarine's"" interests.  And since my opponent was around 1650 I wanted a good game."
58,2,2,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',We have here a queen's gambit declined with black playing a quick h6.
59,2,3,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1ppp1/7p/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',I often play this move in queen's gambit variations.  While it does close the dsb's diagonal I in mind b3 and bb2.  
60,2,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Everything looks to be proceeding normally here.  My last annotated game had been a disaster and I kept this in mind as I selected my moves.
61,2,5,b3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/1PN1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',"Part of the problem in my last game had been that I was failing to see the board.  I had put the blinders on.  ""Rosselsprung"" would have to be more than just a cheap tactical threat."
62,2,6,Bb2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',And so I sortied on.  The bishop on b2 looks like it may be good even though the opening here identifies it as a closed game.
63,2,7,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/1pp1bpp1/p3pn1p/3p4/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PB2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',Later this move would prove a mistake as bd3 would have been stronger.
64,2,8,1Qd2,b'rnbq1rk1/2p1bpp1/pp3n1p/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PB1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Another mistake.  I think taking cd is fine but qc2 or even qd3 was probably better.  Here it proves to be hemmed in by the pawn chain.
65,2,9,1Be6,b'rn1q1rk1/2p1bpp1/pp2bn1p/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PB1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I consider this move pretty debatable given the pawn on d5 and white's a2 and b3 pawns.
66,2,10,c5,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/pp2bn1p/2pp4/3P4/1PN1PN1P/PB1QBPP1/R3K2R w KQ c6',Black finally looks to open the board.  In this position I did not mind c4 or cxd.  I decide to castle kingside even though I often prefer to castle queenside.  I am thinking the rooks will be good on c and d.
67,2,11,1Nxe4,b'rn1q1rk1/4bpp1/pp2b2p/2pp4/3PN3/1P2PN1P/PB1QBPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Maybe I didn't have to take the knight with qc2.  But after dxe and ne5 bc4 seems possible.
68,2,12,1Ng6,b'rn1q1rk1/4b1p1/pp2bpNp/2p5/3Pp3/1P2P2P/PB1QBPP1/R4RK1 b - -',Nc4 also appears strong but white has weakened the light squares around the king and I wanted to play bh5 to threaten winning the exchange.
69,2,13,Nc6,b'r2q2k1/4brp1/ppn1bpNp/2p4B/3Pp3/1P2P2P/PB1Q1PP1/R4RK1 w - -',nxe7 rxe7 was possible but black's dsb is not looking like a very good piece.  I think the decision not to take was sound.
70,2,14,1Rfd1,b'r2q2k1/4brp1/ppn1bpNp/2p4B/3Pp3/1P2P2P/PB1Q1PP1/R2R2K1 b - -',With threats of d5.
71,2,15,1Qd5,b'r5k1/4brp1/ppn1bpNp/2pq3B/3Pp3/1P2P2P/PB1Q1PP1/R2R2K1 w - -',Against d5 and threatening qxh5.
72,2,16,1Qe2,b'r5k1/4brp1/ppn1bpNp/2pq3B/3Pp3/1P2P2P/PB2QPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Obvious threats of dxc followed by rac1.
73,2,17,1dxc5,b'r5k1/4brp1/pp2bpNp/2Pq3B/1n2p3/1P2P2P/PB2QPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',Here I just went ahead and played dxc since I didn't think the knight on b4 was going to be that great.
74,2,18,2Nf4,b'r5k1/4brp1/pp2bp1p/2q4B/1n2pN2/1P2P2P/PB2QPP1/R2R2K1 b - -',In this position rac1 may have been better.  I am threatening to win the exchange and to take nxe6.  Also I am defending d3.
75,2,19,2Bf5,b'r5k1/4brp1/pp3p1p/2q2b1B/1n2pN2/1P2P2P/PB2QPP1/R2R2K1 w - -',He protects against the ne6 threat but is loosing the exchange.  
76,2,20,2Rac1,b'r7/4bkp1/pp3p1p/2q2b2/1n2pN2/1P2P2P/PB2QPP1/2RR2K1 b - -',In this position white looks to be doing well. He is ahead in material has a good knight on f4 has good control of the c and d files and has a good bishop on b2.  Black by contrast is going to have to move his queen to an inactive square and has a knight with no real prospects now that d3 is stronger for white after nf4.
77,2,21,2Qh5+,b'r7/4bkp1/pp3p1p/1q3b1Q/1n2pN2/1P2P2P/PB3PP1/2RR2K1 b - -',I don't think this move is that bad although it is admittedly not great.  Black can just play bg6 although this will certainly lead to simplifications.
78,2,22,2Rc7,b'r5k1/2R1b1p1/pp3p1p/1q3b1Q/1n2pN2/1P2P2P/PB3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',Threatening rdd7 after black defends the bishop and the f5 bishop is dealt with.
79,2,23,Bd6,b'r5k1/2R3p1/pp1b1p1p/1q3b1Q/4p3/1P1NP2P/PB3PP1/3R2K1 w - -',Black tries to create complications with this move.
80,2,24,2Qf7+,b'r5k1/2R2Qp1/pp1b1p1p/1q3b2/4p3/1P1NP2P/PB3PP1/3R2K1 b - -',And white is winning with qxg7# inevitable.  
81,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',My chess has been suffering.  I am getting too lazy to thoroughly analyze tactical sequences.  What follows is a transcription of a game I recently had playing in Santa Cruz.
82,3,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq c6',My opponent was rated around 1600 FIDE.  I wanted to get a good position out of the opening and I placed the bishop classically.  I generally dislike playing Indian systems because of the fianchettoed bishop.  I don't like using the bishop in this way.  With c5 my opponent is playing a Queen's gambit opening.
83,3,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2pP1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',This advance will clearly have major implications.  Black is now committed to a defense of the d5 square and will probably have to play e6.  White could attempt to liberate with b3 or even e4.
84,3,3,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP1B2/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',I think nc3 is sound but maybe nd2 was a better continuation.
85,3,4,h3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP1Bb1/2N1PN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',There has been some very informative discussion in the comments to my last game about the advisability of h3 or a3.  It seems to be a question of timing.  In this position white has problems if black is able to play Ng4.  So the provocation of bg4 looks to be timely.  
86,3,5,Ne5,b'rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3pN2b/2pP1B2/P1N1P2P/1PP1BPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq -',After 8 moves I rate my development sufficient to begin staging for an attack on the black king.
87,3,6,1g4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/4pn2/3pN3/2pP1BP1/P1N1P2P/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQkq g3',The attack is launched but will it be too early.  I thought black will be able to defend this if he plays correctly.  But no one ever plays correctly.  I thought that nxe5 was going to be find for white after be5.
88,3,7,1h4,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/3pN3/2pP1BPP/P1N1P3/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQkq -',I do see the tactic of hxg if white plays an immediate g5.
89,3,8,1h5,b'r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn2/3pN2p/2pP1BPP/P1N1P3/1PP1QP2/R3K2R w KQkq -',Another committal pawn move.  I think gxh ends up looking not so great for white.
90,3,9,1g5,b'r2q3r/pp1nbkp1/4pn2/3p2Pp/2pP1B1P/P1N1P3/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQ -',After the knight sac white prepares an aggressive attack after qf3.  If here ne4 then nxe4 dxe and probably f4.
91,3,10,1Ng4,b'r2q3r/pp1nbkp1/4p3/3p2Pp/2pP1BnP/P1N1P3/1PP1QP2/R3K2R w KQ -',I don't think the knight is that great here.  It does appear to have some purpose attacking f2 and e3.  But black may have difficulty getting it into action.
92,3,11,1e4,b'r2q3r/pp1nbkp1/4p3/3p2Pp/2pPPBnP/P1N5/1PP1QP2/R3K2R b KQ -',Where qf3 was obviously superior.  This is the kind of mistake that causes me to have doubts about my game.  Of course it was blitz but this is just an embarrassing oversight.
93,3,12,1g6,b'r2q3r/pp1nbk2/4p1p1/3p2Pp/2pPPBnP/P1N5/1PP1QP2/R3K2R w KQ -',And again I don't play qf3.  Seemingly this game was a bad choice to annotate.  
94,3,13,1O-O-O,b'r2q3r/pp1nbk2/6p1/3p2Pp/2pP1BnP/P1N5/1PP1QP2/2KR3R b - -',This is just terrible.  I am going to the club in Phoenix next week for an invitational and I need to play a lot better even in blitz.

221,4,121,6Kb3,b'8/8/3Q4/8/7P/1K6/8/k7 b - -',Annoyed that I could have finished sooner I was tired.
222,4,122,6Kb1,b'8/8/3Q4/8/7P/1K6/8/1k6 w - -',A wall of pawns stopping him he took his last move.
223,4,123,6Qd1#,b'8/8/8/8/7P/1K6/8/1k1Q4 b - -',Checkmate. Hope you enjoyed.
224,5,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Once againi'm boored so i decided to annotate one of my recent interesting games. I'm playing with the white pieces.
225,5,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The game became a QGD
226,5,2,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',normally Black plays Nf6 instead of d5 and then d5 but i thought you can play this order too. This was one of my last Catalan games before i switched to 1.e4
227,5,3,h6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',h6? it's pretty much tempo wasting.
228,5,4,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Now it became a normal looking catalan but since black played h6 i have a tempo right now.
229,5,5,Bb4+,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Uh...i think this is the Bogo-indian. I have not prepeared for it at all. (of course white still has a tempo so technically this isn't the Bogo-indian)
230,5,6,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',going in to some kind of a semi-slav. I dunno maybe this is one of the main linesi don't have any clue how Bogo-indian goes.
231,5,7,Bd7,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',a tiny error. Nd7 is a little better.
232,5,8,Qb3,b'rn1qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',now we see that after Bd7my queen attacks b7
233,5,9,Qa5,b'rn2k2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',if black wants to save the bishop.
234,5,10,a3,b'rn2k2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',just putting some pressure on the bishop. Of course im not threatening to take it because the rook is hanging.
235,5,11,Na6,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',only way to get that knight out.
236,5,12,1c5,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/1b1P4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Adding even more pressure on the bishop. The second idea is that even tho i gave up the battle for the d5 square i get the powerfull dark square d6 in this position.
237,5,13,1Bxd2,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/3P4/PQ3NP1/1P1bPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',I gained the bishop pair.
238,5,14,1Bxd2,b'r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/3P4/PQ3NP1/1P1BPPBP/R4RK1 b kq -',I suppose black didn't like the idea of having his bishop on pressure.
239,5,15,1Bf4,b'r3k2r/ppqb1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/PQ3NP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 b kq -',And now we see that after Qc7 in order to protect the pawn. White gets immideately more controll with tempo on the d6 square.
240,5,16,1Qe3,b'r1q1k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 b kq -',Here i simply put up the dangerous future trap of Bxh6. That's the second reason....h6 does both surrender a tempo and weaken blacks kingside. Of course white's e-pawn looks a little uncomfortable.
241,5,17,1Nc7,b'r1q1k2r/ppnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 w kq -',the knight is better of on c7 it's as simple as that. Now it can go to b5 in the near future.
242,5,18,1b4,b'r1q1k2r/ppnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/2Pp4/1P1P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b kq b3',Here i thought that since i have such a strong grip on the king-side. Why dont i get a strong grip on the queen-side as well? white's problem here is the e-pawn and the LSB.
243,5,19,1a5,b'r1q1k2r/1pnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/p1Pp4/1P1P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w kq a6',i think this was the best move.
244,5,20,1bxa5,b'r1q1k2r/1pnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b kq -',Opening up the b-file for me and making my grip a bit stronger.
245,5,21,1Qd8,b'r2qk2r/1pnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w kq -',In one of my calculationsif he'd castle the queen would be better off on d8. Otherwise black temporary gambits a pawn for no compensation.
246,5,22,1Rfb1,b'r2qk2r/1pnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/RR4K1 b kq -',i ignored the fact that black can take the pawn. i didnt wanna become defensive. Instead i seize the b-file and putting an enourmous pressure on the b7-pawn.
247,5,23,1Bc8,b'r1bqk2r/1pn2pp1/2p1pn1p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/RR4K1 w kq -',black moved back with his bishop to defend the pawn.
248,5,24,1Rb6,b'r1bqk2r/1pn2pp1/1Rp1pn1p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b kq -',Rb6. I have such a strong grip on the b-file and the b6-square that the next move is a little forced.
249,5,25,1Nd7,b'r1bqk2r/1pnn1pp1/1Rp1p2p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w kq -',Of course i was hoping for this move. Now i can finally play the annoying move Bd6 without having to worry about Ne4.
250,5,26,1Rb3,b'r1bqk2r/1pnn1pp1/2p1p2p/P1Pp4/3P1B2/PR2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b kq -',I did look a little on a rook sacrifice in that position but it turns out black gets a better position (if he plays all the moves right and i didnt want to risk that)
251,5,27,1Rxa5,b'2bqk2r/1pnn1pp1/2p1p2p/r1Pp4/3P1B2/PR2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',Finally getting back the pawn and now b6 square isnt just as weak.
252,5,28,1a4,b'2bqk2r/1pnn1pp1/2p1p2p/r1Pp4/P2P1B2/1R2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b k -',stopping Nb5 so that i can finally play Bd6.
253,5,29,1Na6,b'2bqk2r/1p1n1pp1/n1p1p2p/r1Pp4/P2P1B2/1R2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',Well.... i dont like that move because of....
254,5,30,2Bd6,b'2bqk2r/1p1n1pp1/n1pBp2p/r1Pp4/P2P4/1R2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b k -',It took me a white but i finally created a strong outpost for the Bishop on d6. perhaps he should have castled before because now you can tell he ain't going to castle for a while.
255,5,31,2Qf6,b'2b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/n1pBpq1p/r1Pp4/P2P4/1R2QNP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',well the only thing this does is controlling the h8-a1 diagonal.
256,5,32,2Qc3,b'2b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/n1pBpq1p/r1Pp4/P2P4/1RQ2NP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b k -',attacking the rook.
257,5,33,2Naxc5,b'2b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/2pBpq1p/r1np4/P2P4/1RQ2NP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',I am not sure if Qd8 works but he decided to sac a knight to save the rook.
258,5,34,2dxc5,b'2b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/2pBpq1p/r1Pp4/P7/1RQ2NP1/4PPBP/R5K1 b k -',i felt that i had a winning position here with my strong grip and material.
259,5,35,2Ra8,b'r1b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/1RQ2NP1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',retreating the rook. I think i will win if i commence a Queen exchange because of my material but...
260,5,36,2Ne5,b'r1b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1RQ3P1/4PPBP/R5K1 b k -',I want to win this game by a crushing attack instead of material. That pleases me most!
261,5,37,2Nf8,b'r1b1kn1r/1p3pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1RQ3P1/4PPBP/R5K1 w k -',(the b-pawn was underfire since if i go Nxd7 it drags away the c8 bishop which is the defender of b7)
262,5,38,2Qb2,b'r1b1kn1r/1p3pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1R4P1/1Q2PPBP/R5K1 b k -',i did look at Nxc6 around here. but then saw that i can perhaps sac a rook for a bishop instead on b7.
263,5,39,2Ra7,b'2b1kn1r/rp3pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1R4P1/1Q2PPBP/R5K1 w k -',He saw my plan and prevented it.
264,5,40,2Qb1,b'2b1kn1r/rp3pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1R4P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 b k -',i was maybe hoping to play Nxc6 without him doing a queen exchange here ruining my attack.
265,5,41,2Nd7,b'2b1k2r/rp1n1pp1/2pBpq1p/2PpN3/P7/1R4P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 w k -',Now came Nd7. Again i was looking at Nxc6 and i loose on that variation.
266,5,42,2Nxd7,b'2b1k2r/rp1N1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/1R4P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 b k -',So yeah...as you see i look a lot on sacrifices on gameknot.
267,5,43,2Bxd7,b'4k2r/rp1b1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/1R4P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 w k -',With this move he over-looked a strong continuation. Kxd7 is just to ugly to be played but now i made this game interesting and guess what move i play.
268,5,44,2Rxb7,b'4k2r/rR1b1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/6P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 b k -',Rxb7!? i sacrifice a rook but i analyzed this position carefully and judged that i win.
269,5,45,2Rxb7,b'4k2r/1r1b1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/6P1/4PPBP/RQ4K1 w k -',Now queen gets dragged from the a1 rook which is the rook sacrifice.
270,5,46,Qxa1+,b'4k2r/1Q1b1pp1/2pBp2p/2Pp4/P7/6P1/4PPBP/q5K1 w k -',heck he even takes that with check! but i have calculated this and i continued to play calm.
271,5,47,2Bf1,b'4k2r/1Q1b1pp1/2pBp2p/2Pp4/P7/6P1/4PP1P/q4BK1 b k -',now even if this sac fails i get a bishop for a rook and it can become a draw. 
272,5,48,2Qf6,b'4k2r/1Q1b1pp1/2pBpq1p/2Pp4/P7/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 w k -',to stop Qb8+ winning da rook.
273,5,49,3a5,b'4k2r/1Q1b1pp1/2pBpq1p/P1Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 b k -',this is what i am relying on. I calculated this very position and thought ''well why dont i advance with my a-pawn. unstoppable!
274,5,50,3Qd8,b'3qk2r/1Q1b1pp1/2pBp2p/P1Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 w k -',Rushing the queen back to the defense.
275,5,51,3a6,b'3qk2r/1Q1b1pp1/P1pBp2p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 b k -',pushing that pawn another step.
276,5,52,3Qc8,b'2q1k2r/1Q1b1pp1/P1pBp2p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 w k -',if 32. Qxc8 Bxc8 33. a7 Bb7 followed by Kd7 and black gets solid. Even 32. e3 f6 33. Qxc8 Bxc8 34. a7 Bb7 and white can try 35. Ba6 but after 35. ... Ba8 there is no way for white to win.
277,5,53,3Qb6,b'2q1k2r/3b1pp1/PQpBp2p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 b k -',Therefor i played Qb7. The main point is to push the a-pawn because 32. a7?? Qxb7. can anyone see.
278,5,54,3f6,b'2q1k2r/3b2p1/PQpBpp1p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 w k -',he wanted to make room of his rook but i analyzed Qb6 deeply and i knew that i would win with the next move...
279,5,55,3a7,b'2q1k2r/P2b2p1/1QpBpp1p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 b k -',and now i expected him to play Qa8 here (only delaying my win!) but he played the blunder...
280,5,56,3Kf7,b'2q4r/P2b1kp1/1QpBpp1p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 w - -',And after...
281,5,57,3Bb8,b'1Bq4r/P2b1kp1/1Qp1pp1p/2Pp4/8/6P1/4PP1P/5BK1 b - -',He resigned. My main point is to queen my a-pawn. I still thought that rook sacrifice was cool even tho the position became equal.
282,6,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',started with a d4 opening
283,6,1,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',transposed immediately in the english
284,6,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',in my opinion this defense is the safest. But i recognized that black will soon find problem on the queen side.
285,6,3,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',still nothing on the center. It is the plan. This black knight is one of the most important pieces in the game.
286,6,4,e4,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',I like to play that with white too. As far as it goes i'd play the same from the other side.
287,6,5,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',This is something I play a lot as I generally don't know what to do with this clear black bishop and the knights are dangerous pieces in the closed english
288,6,6,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',and now starts the real position where black goes on f-g columns and white on b-c.
289,6,7,c5,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - c6',oups... no... so did I lie? No: black just tries to block queen side as you will see. But it won't really work
290,6,8,Be3,b'rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',white clearly views queen-side.

294,6,12,1e5,b'rn1q1rk1/p4pbp/1p1p1np1/2p1p3/2PPP3/2N1BB1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - e6',trying to open on the center. May be over confident as I haven't finished my development unlike white.
295,6,13,1d5,b'rn1q1rk1/p4pbp/1p1p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N1BB1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',white closes the center. The battle really will be on the flanks.
296,6,14,1Na6,b'r2q1rk1/p4pbp/np1p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N1BB1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',he is a defender. Will not see the ocean on the king side.

301,6,19,1cxb5,b'1r1q1rk1/p4pb1/1p1p1npp/1PpPp3/1P2P3/P3BB1P/5PP1/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',Now I prefer black position but it won't last.

But white could easily poses the queen on c2 and free the bishop. I am surprised he never did that... On the other side...
303,6,21,1a4,b'1r3rk1/p2q1pb1/3p1npp/1PpPp3/P3P3/4BB1P/5PP1/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',... white has a tremendous advantage here: a potential passed pawn!

318,6,36,2e4,b'1q3rk1/pr4b1/3p2pp/PPpP1n2/4pp2/3B1P1P/1RQ2BP1/4R1K1 w - -',opening the diagonal and attacking simultaneously the bishop and the rook.
319,6,37,2fxe4,b'1q3rk1/pr4b1/3p2pp/PPpP1n2/4Pp2/3B3P/1RQ2BP1/4R1K1 b - -',yes taking the pawn is the best option.saving the rook would loses a bishop for a pawn.
320,6,38,2Ne3,b'1q3rk1/pr4b1/3p2pp/PPpP4/4Pp2/3Bn2P/1RQ2BP1/4R1K1 w - -',Not Bxb2 immediately as it is followed by exf and white recuperates a good pawn on g6.
321,6,39,2Bxe3,b'1q3rk1/pr4b1/3p2pp/PPpP4/4Pp2/3BB2P/1RQ3P1/4R1K1 b - -',the only viable option here
322,6,40,2Bxb2,b'1q3rk1/pr6/3p2pp/PPpP4/4Pp2/3BB2P/1bQ3P1/4R1K1 w - -',now white has to make a bad choice: taking my bishop or saving his...
323,6,41,2Qxb2,b'1q3rk1/pr6/3p2pp/PPpP4/4Pp2/3BB2P/1Q4P1/4R1K1 b - -',he takes mine...
324,6,42,2fxe3,b'1q3rk1/pr6/3p2pp/PPpP4/4P3/3Bp2P/1Q4P1/4R1K1 w - -',... so i take his.
325,6,43,3Rxe3,b'1q3rk1/pr6/3p2pp/PPpP4/4P3/3BR2P/1Q4P1/6K1 b - -',well it looks like I still have the same advantage considering the captured scale. And white still has his fine attack but there is much more than that. Look weel: white has the diagonal h8-a1 a potential attack on e5 with the pawn and opening the diagonal for the bishop on g6... so do I have to be glad of my quality advantage? It is not really clear. I had a lot of doubts here after I foud myself very proud of the 26th move...
326,6,44,3Kh7,b'1q3r2/pr5k/3p2pp/PPpP4/4P3/3BR2P/1Q4P1/6K1 w - -',protecting g6

331,6,49,3Qg4,b'5r2/pr5k/3p2pp/PPpPq3/4P1Q1/3B2RP/6P1/6K1 b - -',this is much more thant just pointing on g6: it is saying to the rooks: stay on your lines! If not I go on 7th or 8th line. It is a competent move looking confident and I thought to myself: this game is going to last... It is strange to feel as the mouse in the game when I am supposed to have a good advantage.
332,6,50,3Rg7,b'5r2/p5rk/3p2pp/PPpPq3/4P1Q1/3B2RP/6P1/6K1 w - -',ok i stay on my line but I protect my g6 essential point.
333,6,51,3Rf3,b'5r2/p5rk/3p2pp/PPpPq3/4P1Q1/3B1R1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',i guess white has no more idea...

My plan was to try to find a way to play g5 or h5 then to play Rf4. So I guessed white intended here to exchange his rook against the other one and to advance the pawns AFTER having put the bishop under safety (I am potentially threatening Qd4+ remember). I suppose white has no more passion in the game. Too bad because I wanted to try myself here..."
335,7,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',Many people play this opening and it's a great opening. I used to play it all the time but I don't play it anymore. When I played it I never played a fianchetto on the g2 square. That's maybe the reason I had trouble with it. Not playing the fianchetto is still o.k but playing the fianchetto is better for attacking the center.

339,7,4,f3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P5/2N2P2/PP1PP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move does two things. It would later help support e4 and White already sees what black's plan: Mate on f2. It's a little early to play this move and Nf3 does exactly the same thing AND developes a piece. The big downside to this move is that it loses a pawn after Qh4+.
340,7,5,Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2P5/2N2P2/PP1PP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black missed their chance (again). Black will be disappointed to know that the quick mate they were thinking of doesn't work.

344,7,9,exf3,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/1PP5/P1N2p2/3PP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black sets up a small trap. If white takes the pawn with the g pawn it's mate with Qg4. If white takes the big pawn (bishop) black will win with the funniest mate of all time with f2! All white has to do is take the pawn with the knight.

Of course do not accuse me of self-contradiction here for what I previously said about avoiding the unmeaning liquidation of material. Besides if I retreat the B then it can be positive for Black in light of obliging White's Q to stick to its position to prevent Qh1# now that f2 is not an escape square.
However when I saw the possibility of winning a pawn out of BxB I could not resist such a concrete advantage as a having an extra pawn."
512,14,16,Qc3,b'r3r1k1/1b3ppp/p2pp3/8/3P1PP1/2qB3P/P1P2R1Q/R5K1 w - -',So Q attacks both Rh1 and d4 pawn.

519,14,23,2Qf4,b'r5rk/5p1p/p2ppPp1/8/3P1QP1/2qB3P/b1P2R2/3R2K1 b - -',Thank God there was no threat. He just wants my rook to come there.

521,14,25,3g5,b'r5rk/5p1p/p4Pp1/3bp1P1/Q7/2qB3P/2P2R2/3R2K1 b - -',The a6-pawn did not lure my opponent. So let's give him the e4 pawn.
522,14,26,3Qf4,b'r5rk/5p1p/p4Pp1/6P1/5Q2/7q/2P3R1/3R2K1 b - -',What did I achieve from this manoeuvre ? Nothing except the realization that my extra-pawn advantage is a chimera. The exposure of Kg1 plays it its own safety While the pawn setup surrounding my king meant that at most I can keep a rook at the 8-th rank and bring two heavy pieces against White's three. Furthermore My King position somehow meant that manyy scenarios that involve the exchange of pieces would lead to unfavorable ending game.
523,14,27,3Rge8,b'r3r2k/5p1p/p4Pp1/6P1/5Q2/7q/2P3R1/3R2K1 w - -',And of course I had to face the immediate threat of Rh2 ( Followed by Qh attacking h7).  So here I was planning a solution that requires the exchange of Qs. How dramatic !

"
525,14,29,4Rxe2,b'2r4k/5p1p/p4Pp1/6Pq/5Q2/8/2P1R3/R5K1 b - -',Also White does not have other options. The complete exposure of his K is limiting his options with other pieces.
526,14,30,4Qxe2,b'2r4k/5p1p/p4Pp1/6P1/5Q2/8/2P1q3/R5K1 w - -',I am relatively in a safe position. But I had to solve the K-safety issue and then make use of the extra pawn.
527,14,31,h5,b'2r4k/5p2/p3qPp1/6Pp/2P2Q2/8/8/2R3K1 w - h6',I could not imagine another moment to do it. White's Q cannot touch the g file because of White's K being on the same g-file. Also the fact that Black Q can target e3 which is common to Kg1 and Rc1 implies that White's Q will be restricted in its choices.
528,14,32,Kh7,b'2r5/5p1k/p3qP1P/6p1/2PQ4/8/8/2R3K1 w - -',I thought the victory is mine here by forcing Black to lose f6. Two choices were possible : either the Kh7 or the Rc6. I selected Rh7 and was expecting Rc2.
529,14,33,4c5,b'2r5/5p1k/p3qP1P/2P3p1/3Q4/8/8/2R3K1 b - -',No he played c5.
530,14,34,Qh3,b'2r5/5p2/p4P1k/2P3p1/3Q4/7q/8/5RK1 w - -',"I played this in view of the posibility to force White's K to be on h file then after my Kg6 I cumulate
to the existing threats on White's pawn the idea of Rh8+. "
531,14,35,4Kh1,b'2r5/5p2/p4P1k/2P3p1/3Q4/6q1/5R2/7K b - -',This really came as a shock to me. My head was telling this would only precipitate the plan of Kg6. However as R is still on f-file guarding f6 and Whites' Q able to play e4+ my king is in danger. I soon realized that my plan was incorrect and I have to cope with the inevitabilily of R+ and my K to tour the World. Now you can understand the title of the game.
532,14,36,4Rb8,b'1r6/5p2/p4P1k/2P3p1/3Q4/6q1/5R2/7K w - -',So I played this more as a defense than as an attack. Q and R needed be connected as a means to secure the R from potential Q checks attacking both K and R.
533,14,37,Kxf6,b'1r6/5p2/p4k2/2P3p1/4Q3/6q1/7R/7K w - -',And the journey began.
534,14,38,Ke8,b'1r2k3/5p2/p4Q1R/2P3p1/8/6q1/8/7K w - -',Of course Kd7 loses to Qx followed by R#
535,14,39,Kb5,b'1r6/5Q2/p6R/1kP3p1/8/6q1/8/7K w - -',Taking the pawn would have been the biggest mistake in the game as it would make it possible for coordinate a checkmate using R and Q.
536,14,40,5Qd7+,b'1r6/3Q4/p6R/1kP3p1/8/6q1/8/7K b - -',The choice of Ka was discovered to be bad I can't find out why now.

This B has nothing much to bite on yet as the attack on the Q is easily foiled but would pin a N blocking the attack on the Q and could swap with a B doing the same.  If Black blocked with ...f6 that would weaken his kingside.  If Black left the B alone it would be nicely placed.

Up to now I had used about 10 minutes more than him.  Over the next few moves I developed a handy cushion.  What I loved about it was that it was a logical progression from my previous play while being far from obvious and at first sight like so many small Q moves seemingly innocuous.  The more I looked into it the better it seemed - a sort of puzzle reset move.

787,23,51,2Rdg8,b'2k3r1/pp6/2p5/8/3P1p2/P1PK1P1b/6rP/4R3 w - -',He moved out- rather oddly.

794,23,58,3Re6,b'2k5/pp6/2pKR1r1/8/3P1p2/P1P2P1b/6rP/8 b - -',I blocked and he should have sacrificed. It would have won him the game.
795,23,59,3Rg6g5,b'2k5/pp6/2pKR3/6r1/3P1p2/P1P2P1b/6rP/8 w - -',No dice. He escaped my 'attack' and lost the game. There is another big mistake.

889,25,19,2Qe8#,b'1k2Qb1r/ppp5/3p1p2/4p3/4P1pq/3PB1R1/PPP3PP/R6K b - -',Maybe he was hoping I did not know what I had and would play Kg1.  Better to have given up the Rook with say b7 or c5 although an ultimate loss would still have been likely.

Ok moments earlier black began mainlining heroin and imagined white's pawn had transmogrified into a knightly stallion.  How did black earn 1300 with moves like that?  Perhaps black's six year old nephew made this move while black was watching Dancing with the Stars.  Mm.  Black's e rook already prevented white's pawn from nabbing the bishop at f5.  I cannot discern any clear motive for Qe7.  With all white's firepower on the d rank black has little hope of a sudden checkmate with the queen sacrifice.  To add insult to injury that important central d5 pawn remains undefended.

One possibility here is that black will be saddled with floating pawns on c5 and d5.  Cxd also opened up the possibility of bishop b5+ although in this position it does not appear advantageous.

I also had the idea of sacking a knight with ng6+ followed by h5+ and qg6+.  But this seemed arrogant and uncertain.  H4 was a safer bet and probably a better try.

This is a game to illustrate that Knights on the Rim can be dim!  Adam a former Expert could not resist a little bit of pawn grabbing a sin I have sometimes been guilty of when I have done this against Freddy the Master Mater and paid with my king!  Adam was a little more fortunate his knight ended up getting coralled on the rim.  Adam had a potentially decisive kingside pawn majority.  I was taking no chances and so Henry did a royal progress up the chessboard and forced Adam to exchange pawns.  Adam was then left with a side pawn which Fou Lenoir captured and the game ended as a draw with neither players having sufficient material.  Computer Analysis for this game has been done so you can pick up my game in my past games profile and follow the game that way.  Black responds 1..... e6 to my e4 and so this becomes the French Defense."

It seemed as though I had blundered a pawn because Henry had to move out of the way to avoid losing Fou Lenoir in a knight fork and therefore the a pawn fell but as you can see - at a price!  Fou Lenoir coralls the knight!

The result will be a draw on the grounds of insufficient mating force.  That was exactly what happened and Adam and I had to manually agree a draw on move 49.  A pleasing result for me as it was a High Draw - my current form is very erratic but the more of these kind of results I get the more likely my rating may upsurge again should I be at the top of my game!
