41,2,0,4Rd7,b'r5k1/3R2p1/2p5/3n1PN1/8/1r6/1P4R1/1K6 b - -',Thus far this game has been a rather tense affair in which Black has objectively had the worst of it. The play was greatly affected by the tournament situation. Lasker was involved in a big battle with Capablanca for overall tournament victory. After a slow start Lasker had found himself trailing the Cuban significantly and in order to have any chance of catching him he needed to win practically every game in the second half of the event. In the present game he had therefore played in his typically provocative style spurning straightforward equality in favour of stirring up complications in the hope thereby of obtaining chances to outplay his opponent. We join the game just at the moment where Lasker's tactics have paid off as White's last was a serious mistake which costs the exchange. However that is only the start of the interest. 
42,2,1,4Rxd5,b'r5k1/6p1/2p5/3R1PN1/8/3r4/1P4R1/1K6 b - -',Surprisingly this is forced. The threat was 42 ...Nc3+. Moving the rook away e.g. 42. Rb7 allows 42. ...Rd1+ 43. Kc2 Ne3+ picking up the other rook whilst 42. Kc1 walks into a snap mate after 42. ...Ra1+ 43. Kc2 Nb4 mate.
43,2,2,4Ne6,b'r5k1/6p1/2p1N3/3r1P2/8/8/1P4R1/1K6 b - -',Despite his extra exchange Black's game is extremely difficult to win as he is losing the g-pawn with the result that there will be only one pawn apiece. Fine points out that with an extra exchange the most difficulties in winning often arise with two rooks vs rook and knight because the latter pair of pieces can cover all the entry squares and make it very difficult for the stronger side's king to penetrate. With so few pawns left as well the difficulties in winning are at their greatest.
44,2,3,Rd6,b'r7/2R5/2prNk2/5P2/8/8/1P6/1K6 w - -',Obviously Black needs to hang onto his remaining pawn at all costs.
45,2,4,4Nf4,b'r7/2R5/2pr1k2/5P2/5N2/8/1P6/1K6 b - -',As Fine explains so long as White retains his rook there is little that Black can do whereas once the rook comes off the position is an easy win for Black. The latter's task is therefore to force the exchange of White's rook which he does by a combination of mating threats and pins on the knight. With Alekhine defending stoutly this proves a long process.
46,2,5,Kc7,b'1r6/2k5/2p4r/5R2/8/2KN4/1P6/8 w - -',"Black's king cannot really do anything active because it is too vulnerable to checks so instead it remains in

51,2,10,Kb6,b'8/8/1kp5/1r6/5NR1/2K5/1P6/7r w - -',For the moment Lasker continues to manoeuvre and probe without making any real progress. This is a natural part of the practical playing of such an ending. The pressure of the clock among other things means that such an approach is frequently inevitable.
52,2,11,6Rb4+,b'8/8/1kp5/3r4/1R6/3N3r/1PK5/8 b - -',69. Nf4 Rd4 would force the exchange of rooks at once whilst 69. Nf2 Rh2 70. Rf4 Rg2 leaves White tied up.

54,2,13,7Rd1,b'8/8/2pk4/3r4/8/2KN2r1/1P6/3R4 b - -',Now the knight is pinned both ways and Black can start to activate his king.

62,3,1,c5,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1n2p2p/2p5/8/2P1PN2/P3BPPP/1R3RK1 w - -',This position looks extremely equal  but in fact White has a small plus: he can attack the cs-pawn in short order  and assume some initiative as a result. This should result in his pieces being a little more active than Black's. Even so  it is desperately hard to imagine White winning the position against a worldclass opponent and without the aid of a crude mistake from the defender.
63,3,2,1Rfc1,b'r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1n2p2p/2p5/8/2P1PN2/P3BPPP/1RR3K1 b - -',An extremely subtle move which  would not enter many players' heads. Karpov intends l:!bs but at the moment this runs into ... i.a6. The rook moves to free fl so that White can play 'itf1 to defend the  bishop on e2. The question then i s where should the rook move to? Most players would choose the open file but Karpov understands that Black may start counterplay by attacking the c3-pawn with ... tt:la4 or ... tt:lds so he overprotects the pawn in anticipation.
64,3,3,Bd5,b'r4rk1/p4pp1/1n2p2p/2pb4/8/2P1PN2/P3BPPP/1RR2K2 w - -',"18 ... i.c6 would have prevented White's next but then 19 tt:les is unpleasant when the knight can attack

66,3,5,2Ra5,b'r4rk1/p2n1pp1/4p2p/R1pb4/8/2P1PN2/P3BPPP/2R2K2 b - -',White has achieved his first aim. His rook is now very active on as attacking both of Black's isolated pawns and tying his pieces down to defence.
67,3,6,2Ne1,b'rr4k1/p2n1pp1/2b1p2p/R1p5/2P5/4P3/P3BPPP/2R1NK2 b - -',The manner in which Karpov coordinates his pieces is beyond all praise. The knight heads for d3 from  where it attacks 􀃲weakness on c5 and at the same time 􀃱ents the black rook taking up an active post in the white position on b2 or (as we will see) b4. This is the true meaning of prophylaxis - it is about more than simply taking defensive measures against the enemy's threats and instead involves finding ways to improve one's  own position  whilst at the same time defeating the enemy's plans.
68,3,7,2Bd1,b'r5k1/p2n1pp1/2b1p2p/R1p5/1rP5/4P3/P4PPP/2RBNK2 b - -',"Another prophylactic manoeuvre. Karpov anticipates the threat of 23 ... l:ta4 exchanging off White's active

Karpov calmly eliminates this possibility whilst at the same time limiting the scope of the enemy bishop and freeing his own king from the defence of g2. The c5-pawn is not going anywhere.
70,3,9,2Rd8,b'3r2k1/pr1n1pp1/2b1p2p/R1p5/2P5/4PP2/P5PP/2RBNK2 w - -',If he tries to defend the c-pawn with  24 ... .l:.c7 2 5 lt:ld3 .i.b7 then 26 .i.a4 wins it anyway.

If  he takes the pawn at once then after 26 lt:lxc5 lt:lxc5 27 .l:!.xc5 Black has the  remarkable resource 27. ..If. b2! ? 28 .l:!.xc6 :dd2 with surprisingly strong counterplay despite the piece deficit. Rather 1than allow his opponent to fish in such murky waters Karpov calmly seals up the b-file before helping himself to the first fruits of his superb play.
73,3,12,Rd6,b'5k2/pr3p2/2brp2p/2R3p1/2P5/1B2PP2/P5PP/2R2K2 w - -',Finally White has won the c5-pawn without allowing any active counterplay.  The next stage is to  onsolidate and start on the process of converting his advantage.
74,3,13,3Rd1,b'8/pr2kp2/2brp2p/2R3p1/2P5/1B2PP2/P3K1PP/3R4 b - -',Exchanging pieces is generally a  good idea when material up especially when there is still plenty of material on the board.

76,3,15,3e4,b'8/pr6/2bkp3/R4ppp/2P1P3/1B3P2/P3K1PP/8 b - -',Karpov immediately tries to take  advantage of the weakening of the enemy kingside pawns. This move involves exchanging two pairs of pawns which in principle is not necessarily to the stronger side's advantage. It also  gives Black a passed pawn on the e-file which may be a source of counterplay. On the other hand at the end of the process the black h-pawn will be vulnerable.
77,3,16,3Ke3,b'8/pr6/3kp3/5bRp/2P5/1B2K3/P5PP/8 b - -',"Panchenko suggests that White  should fix the h s-pawn with 37 h4 but Karpov was presumably reluctant to

79,3,18,Re8,b'4r3/p7/3k4/4p3/2P3R1/PBK3Pp/7P/1b6 w - -',The passed pawn can be blockaded  securely enough after 42 ... e4 43 􀅂dl. Instead Kasparov transfers his rook to the f-file to invade via f2 or fl.
80,3,19,4Rg7,b'4r3/p5R1/3k4/4p3/2P5/PBK3Pp/7P/1b6 b - -',One might have expected Karpov to go after the h-pawn so as to eliminate the counterplay this pawn might offer. Indeed after 43 .l:.h4 .l:lf8 44 .l:.xh3 l:tf3+ 45 <i;;b2 it is not obvious how Black can exploit the temporary misplacing of  White's rook. However White's pieces have lost coordination and his king is cut off and Karpov's adjournment analysis had presumably convinced him that an easier win was to be had by reating another passed pawn of his own on the queenside and playing actively.

With Black having what is clearly a bad bishop obstructed by its own pawns Petrosian actually exchanges it off! It might seem as though he has taken leave of his senses but in fact of course it is an exceptionally deep decision. The most obvious way for White to play this position is to exchange rooks and bishop for knight and so aim to reach an ending with knight versus the ""bad bishop"". Let us assume that Black cooperates fully in allowing this: 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Rd1 lRxd1+ 20. Kxd1 h6 (Black could of course move his knight to c8 to avoid the further exchange
but we will assume he ""comes quietly"") 21. Bxb6+ Kxb6 22. g4. 
White has achieved his ""dream"" position. Black has the bad bishop and White's pieces have great squares on e4 and f5. So why did Petrosian not go in for this? The reason is because he considered that White has few if any chances of winning from here the main problem being that bad bishops are very good defenders of weak pawns whilst White has no way to break through. Black sticks his king on e6 and waits. Even if White gets his knight to fs and king to e4 Black just drops his bishop back to f8 and marks time with his king. In Petrosian's own words ""winning such a position would be very very difficult if not impossible Instead Petrosian chooses another plan entirely. Recognizing that Black's formally bad bishop is actually an effective defender of his  weaknesses on f6 and h6 he exchanges it so as to increase the vulnerability of these targets."

107,5,0,5Qxe6,b'8/8/4Q3/k6K/8/6P1/8/q7 b - -',"Relatively little was known about this type of endgame at the time this game was played and despite a few inaccuracies in the play Botvinnik first whole endgame has now been ""tablebased"" it is not always a simple matter to divine the underlying point behind many of the computer's moves. Broadly we can point out the following rules of thumb:
1. One of White's main weapons in such endings is the ""cross-check"" i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen so as himself to give check and so force an exchange of queens. This idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings. 
2. Whilst there are no hard and fast rules as to which positions are won and which are not it is true to say that the stronger side generally has most winning chances with a centre pawn or bishop's pawn fewer chances with a knight's pawn and fewest of all with a rook's pawn. The tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play. 
3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board where its influence is at its greatest and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.
4. The stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. This maximizes the chance of cross-checks. 
5. With a knight's pawn as here the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words the a1-corner in this position). This too is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.

Armed with these basic principles we will see how Botvinnik handled the ending. It should be noted that he had the benefit of adjournment analysis of course; and since this was an Olympiad it can be assumed that his teammates will have contributed. In my opinion none of this diminishes the value of Botvinnik's achievement in this game.
"
108,5,1,5g4,b'8/8/4Q1K1/k7/6P1/2q5/8/8 b - -',It should be noted that White cannot be prevented from advancing his pawn at least as far as the sixth rank in such positions. This does not mean that the position is lost or that the defender has erred. The real  technical problems for White starts once his pawn gets to the sixth rank.
109,5,2,5Qd2,b'8/8/4Q1K1/k7/6P1/8/3q4/8 w - -',This is a typical example of the application of the principles enunciated above especially principles (3) and (4). Thanks to the position of his king and queen White is in a position to meet checks such as 59 ...Qd3+?? with the cross-check 60. Qf5+.
110,5,3,Qd4,b'8/8/4Q1K1/k5P1/3q4/8/8/8 w - -',"Thus far the tablebase confirms that Black has defended well enough to keep the position within drawing
bounds but his last move is an inaccuracy after which the position is a win for White albeit in 65 moves. Black has five possible drawing moves here but the most logical of these following principle (5) above is 60 ... Ka4. heading the black king towards the safety zone in the south-west corner."
111,5,4,6Qf5+,b'8/8/6K1/k4QP1/3q4/8/8/8 b - -',An inaccuracy in turn. The ruthless tablebase shows that White has only one move to win here and that is the  rather illogical 61 Kh7 which goes against the principle that the white king should seek a position o in the same or the adjacent file as its opposite number. However I do not think either player can be reproached for such minor imprecisions given the huge complexity of such endings. All any human player can hope for is to understand the basic principles and apply them as far as possible; the tactical features of these positions are so great that they are always going to be beyond a human player's capacity.
112,5,5,Qh1,b'8/8/8/5QP1/k5K1/8/8/7q w - -',"Another imprecision after which the assessment swings over to ""winning"" once again. Of Black's three
drawing moves two involve following principle (5) above and heading his king towards the safe corner: 6. ...Ka3 or 63 ...Kb3."
113,5,6,6Qf4+,b'8/8/8/6P1/k4QK1/8/8/7q b - -',"White finds the most accurate move underlining the drawback of Black's last. Now his king is forced away

114,5,7,6Qe5+,b'8/8/8/k3Q1P1/6K1/8/8/7q b - -',"There is nothing wrong with the immediate 65 g6 (indeed it even wins two moves quicker) but Botvinnik's
move is more logical from the human viewpoint - he first puts his queen on a more centralized square in accordance with principle (3)."
115,5,8,Qd8+,b'3q4/8/6P1/4Q1K1/k7/8/8/8 w - -',"Once again the proximity of the opposing kings means that crosschecks are in the air both after
67 ...Qd2+? 68. Qf4+ and 67. ...Qg1+ 68. Kf5! when there are no safe checks. 68. Kf5 Qc8+ 69. Kf4 Qcl+ 70. Qe3 Qc7+ 71. Qe5.  In itself this move does not spoil anything but it is the start of a short phase during which Botvinnik loses his way. He should prefer 71. Kg4 or 71. Kg5."
116,5,9,7Qf6,b'3q4/8/5QP1/6K1/k7/8/8/8 b - -',We have actually reached the same position as after Black's 67th move. The first time round Botvinnik found the  most accurate move 74 Kf5. It should also be noted that the plan of placing the white king in front of his pawn with 74. Kh6? Qh4+ 75. Kg7 is much weaker. This was a lesson that Botvinnik had been forced to learn the hard way as he had made exactly that mistake in the same ending against the Soviet master Ravin sky eight years earlier. The tablebase confirms that the ending is then a draw.
117,5,10,Qe8,b'4q3/8/6P1/5Q1K/k7/8/8/8 w - -',Now there are no more profitable checks since after 76. ...Qh8+ 77. Kg4 Black once again suffers from his king  being on the same rank as its opposite number. One can see how much easier his defensive task would be if his king were now on a2 or a1 as it could have been had he taken his chances earlier in the endgame. However even though he is out of checks Black is not yet completely out of ammunition. Instead Minev resorts to another typical defensive technique in such queen endings - pinning the pawn.
118,5,11,7Qf4+,b'4q3/8/6P1/7K/k4Q2/8/8/8 b - -',"A fundamental error of principle which again endangers the win. This move simply drives the black king
closer towards the safe comer and the tablebase confirms that the position should be drawn after this. Instead White can win with several continuations the main one being 77. Kg4. However the difficulty of such endings is attested to by the fact that the win still takes 60 moves from this position! (However this does not mean it is a draw - White will of course advance his g-pawn again inside the so moves allowance)."
119,5,12,7Ka5,b'4q3/8/6P1/k6K/5Q2/8/8/8 w - -',Returning the favour. It is clear that Minev did not understand the point about where his king was best placed a forgivable error for his time but one which makes Botvinnik's task easier. Obviously the black king should emulate the birds and gratefully migrate to the kinder climate of the south with 77 ...Ka3! .
120,5,13,7Qd4+,b'4q3/8/6P1/7K/k2Q4/8/8/8 b - -',"Botvinnik follows principle (3) and takes the chance to centralize his queen with gain of tempo. In so doing
he maximizes its influence and so reduces the enemy queen's scope for checks."
121,5,14,8Kg5,b'4q3/8/6P1/k5K1/3Q4/8/8/8 b - -',Now we see the effect of Botvinnik's  piece positioning. Black soon runs out of checks whilst the superbly placed white queen also controls the next square of the pawn g7.
122,5,15,8Ke4,b'5q2/8/6P1/k7/3QK3/8/8/8 b - -',Once again the possibility of a cross-check means that Black is out of checks and this time he cannot prevent the pawn advancing further.
123,5,16,8Qe5+,b'8/8/6Pq/k3Q3/4K3/8/8/8 b - -',Once again the tablebase shows that the immediate 83 g7 wins slightly more quickly but the human instinct is to improve the queen position first.
124,5,17,8Kd4,b'8/6P1/8/4Q3/k2K4/8/8/7q b - -',"Another characteristic idea for such endings. With the pawn only one square from queening the white king

white que􀘖n occupies a dominating central square also controlling the queening square of the pawn the two kings stand close together and all the possible checks are defeated by a crosscheck. Despite a number of inaccuracies this is a classic endgame and immensely instructive. Without the aid of either tablebases or any substantial heoretical practice apart from his own game against Ravinsky years before
Botvinnik effectively ""solved"" this ending in his adjournment analysis identifying all the key elements of the
winning method in such positions. "

If the white rook were on a6 and the black rook on a4 the game would be a draw although it is not as easy to defend as once thought as mentioned in the next example but as it is White is winning by force. The ending is also of great historical significance because this was game 34 of the AlekhineCapablanca world championship match. Alekhine led 5-3 in decisive games needing six wins to take the world title so this was the endgame which dethroned the great ""invincible"" Cuban and gave the chess world its fourth world champion."
129,6,1,5Ra4,b'8/5pk1/r5pp/P7/R6P/6P1/5PK1/8 b - -',"The vital first step. The rook takes up position behind its passed pawn. Now the black rook is tied to a6 else the white pawn will advance whilst the white rook can make tempo moves back down the a-file as required. White's plan is as follows: 
1. Bring his king over towards the pawn. The black king will have to stand in opposition to prevent the white king reaching b5 and forcing the advance of the pawn.
2. Once the kings stand in opposition a waiting move by the white rook will force the black king to give way; either it allows its opposite number into b5 or into the kingside (two weaknesses!}."
130,6,2,h5,b'8/5p2/r5p1/P3k2p/R6P/4K1P1/5P2/8 w - -',"I have always thought it curious that although this ending has been examined in almost every major endgame textbook this move has hardly ever been commented upon. Yet it is open to the objection that it weakens the square g5 and so allows the white king an avenue via this square into black's kingside pawns as indeed occurs later in the game. It therefore seems logical to suggest 56. ...Kd5 keeping the pawn on h6. 

By a curious coincidence just as this book was being written German endgame expert Dr Karsten Muller devoted one of his Chess Cafe endgame columns to an examination of this very move prompted by  analysis supplied by a German amateur Erich Korber. The full analysis is too extensive to reproduce here and can be found in Muller's column anyway but the conclusion is that White still wins. The main line of the analysis immediately exploits Black's failure to play 56 ...h5 as follows: 57. h5 Ke6 (or 57. ...g5 58. f4 gxf4+ 59. Kxf4 and White's king invades the kingside rather as in the final phase of the game continuation) 58. hxg6 fxg6 and White will now be able to create another passed pawn this time on the  king side. 
Just as in the game Black will not be able to hold both fronts: 59. f4 h5 60. Kd4 Kd6 61. Ra3! and White wins in similar fashion to the game: his king will either penetrate on the queenside and support the apawn or will attack the kingside pawns supported at the crucial moment by a switch of his rook.

Quite apart from Larsen's superb handling of the ending especially in the latter phase the game is instructive in demonstrating that even apparently drawish positions can be won with only the smallest error from the opponent if one has the determination to try. In the first instance the latter is the key. If one asks ""How does one win such a position against a strong opponent?"" the first stage of the answer is ""By not agreeing a draw!"" .
In playing on White does have a couple of small straws from which to weave his basket. Firstly the black bishop on h7 is currently shut out of play by the white e4-pawn and will take some time to emerge into play. Secondly White has a space advantage thanks to his pawns on e4 and f4. "

Also this is my bad bishop and his good bishop with the current pawn structure. I didn't want to take the knight with the bishop since he could plant his bishop on b5 and cause minor irritation.

Ok not quite the lady at Flambards but nevertheless Cristiana certainly ended up as Lady Bountiful at the end of this game.  She was playing her mentor Skorpio47 (aka Klaus) in a Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT and she managed a Master Draw against him.  So I want to learn from Cristiana's experience and just see how she did it.  This MT was a themed tournament called The Dutch Defense.  So how did she do it?  Well read on......"
311,14,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',3. ..... Nf6 - both sides get their king knights out.  A kingside fianchetto is on the cards for these players.

335,14,25,4Qg6,b'2r4k/p1r3b1/1p4Qp/8/P1P5/1K4R1/8/8 b - -',41. Qg6 - now Klaus' queen tries to counter-attack.  Note that the rook on c7 cannot move off the second rank because Cristiana's king will cop Old Matey!
336,14,26,bxa5,b'4r2k/p3r1b1/3Q3p/p7/2P5/1K4R1/8/8 w - -',43. ..... bxa5 - Klaus has sacrificed a pawn.  What is he up to?

338,15,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This was a recent short game that I really enjoyed playing.  It starts off with my standard e4.    
339,15,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black responds with e6 - the French defence. 
340,15,2,Bb4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',The Winawer variation.  In this position I think white normally plays 4.e5 and then black responds with 4...c5 exerting some pressure on the centre.  
341,15,3,a3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',But I am not one for lots of opening theory so I played 4.a3.  This is probably some sort of established line but the idea is to sacrifice the pawn on e4 to exert some pressure on black's kingside.    
342,15,4,Bxc3+,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black captures the knight.
343,15,5,bxc3,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I re-capture.
344,15,6,dxe4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',And now the pawn sac is accepted.  
345,15,7,Qg4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp1Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -',Black now has a choice as to which pawn to return.  The one on e4 or the pawn on g6.  
346,15,8,Nf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3Pp1Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq -',Offering the pawn on g6 in return for some piece development but losing the ability to castle kingside.  
347,15,9,Qh6,b'rnbqk1r1/ppp2p1p/4pn1Q/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQq -',This is all pretty standard stuff I think.  In terms of material both sides are level.  Black is slightly ahead in development but must castle queenside and his pawn on e4 is weak.  A fairly balanced position in my view.
348,15,10,Bg5,b'r1bqk1r1/pppn1p1p/4pn1Q/6B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR b KQq -',A useful pin.  
349,15,11,b6,b'r1bqk1r1/p1pn1p1p/1p2pn1Q/6B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR w KQq -',Black is looking to fianchetto his bishop to protect e4 and potentially exert some pressure on g2.  It also assists with castling.  
350,15,12,1Bb5,b'r1bqk1r1/p1pn1p1p/1p2pn1Q/1B4B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq -',Threatening the knight on f6.
351,15,13,1Rg6,b'r1bqk3/p1pn1p1p/1p2pnrQ/1B4B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR w KQq -',A good move.  Defending the knight and kicking the queen. 
352,15,14,1Qh4,b'r1bqk3/p1pn1p1p/1p2pnr1/1B4B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq -',The only square that protects the bishop.
353,15,15,1Bb7,b'r2qk3/pbpn1p1p/1p2pnr1/1B4B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR w KQq -',A perfectly natural move but a mistake.
354,15,16,1Bxd7+,b'r2qk3/pbpB1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq -',Now black must recapture with his king or face losing the knight on f6.  
355,15,17,1Kxd7,b'r2q4/pbpk1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ -',Now black has a horrible pin and his king is out of position.  Can I exploit this?  
356,15,18,1Ne2,b'r2q4/pbpk1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P1NPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Catching up on development but threatening Nf4.

358,15,20,1Rxg5,b'r6q/pbpk1p1p/1p2pn2/6r1/3PpN1Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black opts for the loss of exchange.  
359,15,21,Qg7,b'r7/pbpk1pq1/1p2pn1p/4Q3/3PpN2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Aiming for queen g5 and simplification.  
360,15,22,1O-O-O,b'r7/pbpk1pq1/1p2pn1p/4Q3/3PpN2/P1P5/2P2PPP/2KR3R b - -',I thought for a while before deciding which side to castle.  Kingside looked better protected but I was concerned about black playing rg8 e3 and then attacking g2 using pawn h5 to h4 to h3.  Castling queenside places the rook on d1 on the same file as black's king which I thought useful. 
361,15,23,1Qg5,b'r7/pbpk1p2/1p2pn1p/4Q1q1/3PpN2/P1P5/2P2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Aiming for an exchange of queens and simplification perhaps with drawing chances.  
362,15,24,1c4,b'r7/pbpk1p2/1p2pn1p/4Q1q1/2PPpN2/P7/2P2PPP/2KR3R b - -',A cunning plan.  Now if 18...Qxe5 19. fxe5+ and white wins the knight as it cannot go to d5. 
363,15,25,1c6,b'r7/pb1k1p2/1pp1pn1p/4Q1q1/2PPpN2/P7/2P2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Looking to control d5

365,15,27,2d5,b'r7/pb1k1pq1/1pp1pn1p/3PQ3/2P1pN1P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R b - -',Now the breakthrough.  Black is threatening to rip open the d-file and invade with the rook.  
366,15,28,c5,b'r7/pb1k1pq1/1p3n1p/2pPQ3/4pN1P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Black attempts to keep the d-file closed and avoids a pawn exchange on c6 with discovered check.  Now I was struggling to see how to progress the attack.  If 22. d6 (threatening 23. Qd7+) black can play 22...Rd8 and he seems to be OK.  I needed to get my rook on d1 into the game.  
367,15,29,2Ne6,b'r7/pb1k1pq1/1p2Nn1p/2pPQ3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R b - -',So I played 22. Ne6.  A positional sactifice that threatens 23. Qc7+ and then 24. Qxb7 picking up the bishop with a strong attack.  So black must take the knight.  
368,15,30,2fxe6,b'r7/pb1k2q1/1p2pn1p/2pPQ3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Which he does
369,15,31,2dxe6+,b'r7/pb1k2q1/1p2Pn1p/2p1Q3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R b - -',And I recapture with discovered check and bring my long lost rook on d1 into the game.  
370,15,32,2Kc6,b'r7/pb4q1/1pk1Pn1p/2p1Q3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2KR3R w - -',Probably the best square for the king.  If 23....Ke7 white has 24. Rd7+ picking up the bishop on b7 or black's queen if the knight captures the rook.  23...Ke8 then 24. Rd7 and white again picks up the bishop with a strong attack.  23...Kc8 loses instantly to 24. Rd7 and then 25. Qc7# or black must give up his queen with 24...Nxd7.  
371,15,33,2Rd6+,b'r7/pb4q1/1pkRPn1p/2p1Q3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2K4R b - -',Now the king is getting flushed out.  
372,15,34,2Kb5,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/1kp1Q3/4p2P/P7/2P2PP1/2K4R w - -',Black cannot play 24...Kc7 as this allows 25. Rd7+ with a double attack and picking up black's queen for free.  
373,15,35,2a4+,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/1kp1Q3/P3p2P/8/2P2PP1/2K4R b - -',Harrassing black's king some more and trying to draw it up the board.  If 25....Ka6 then white has Qxc5 and a threat of mate on b5.  
374,15,36,2Kb4,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p1Q3/Pk2p2P/8/2P2PP1/2K4R w - -',Black ignores the pawn and his king heads to b4.  Now white must strike quickly and try to force a mate. 
375,15,37,2Qb2+,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p5/Pk2p2P/8/1QP2PP1/2K4R b - -',So I play Qb2+.   Now 26...Kc4 loses to 27. Qb3# and after 26...Ka5 27. Qb5#.  
376,15,38,2Kxa4,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p5/k3p2P/8/1QP2PP1/2K4R w - -',The only square.  Now I just need to land a knock-out blow!  But how?
377,15,39,2Rh3,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p5/k3p2P/7R/1QP2PP1/2K5 b - -',A deadly quiet move.  Suddenly the rook is coming to a3 to mate and there is nothing black can do about it.
378,15,40,2e3,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p5/k6P/4p2R/1QP2PP1/2K5 w - -',Delaying the inevitable. 
379,15,41,2Rxe3,b'r7/pb4q1/1p1RPn1p/2p5/k6P/4R3/1QP2PP1/2K5 b - -',But it's all over and here my opponent resigned.  A fun game and a nice little king hunt to finish.  Look forward to your comments.  Cheers.

However with opposite-coloured bishops on the board it is hard to believe that this advantage should prove sufficient for a win. In the absence of the rooks there would of course be no winning chances at all but with two pairs of rooks on the board the drawing tendency of the opposite bishops is greatly reduced. Andersson gives a veritable tour de force of technique.
496,21,1,1b4,b'r2r4/p3kpp1/2p5/3bp2p/1P5P/P1R1B1P1/4PP2/R3K3 b - b3',As always fixing weaknesses is crucial.
497,21,2,1Rdb8,b'rr6/p3kpp1/2p5/3bp2p/1P5P/P1R1B1P1/4PP2/R3K3 w - -',A key tactical point of White's last move is that Black cannot get rid of the weak a-pawn by 19 ... a5? because of 20 bxa5 Rxa5? 21. Bb6. He will therefore have to remain with both queenside pawn weaknesses.
498,21,3,Ke6,b'rr6/p4pp1/2p1k3/3bp2p/1P5P/P1R3P1/3BPP2/R3K3 w - -',Once again tactics prevent Black ridding himself of the a-pawn: 20 ... a5? 21. bxa5 Rxas 22. Re3 winning a pawn.
499,21,4,2Rcc1,b'r7/p4pp1/2p1k3/1r1bp2p/1P5P/P5P1/3BPP2/R1R1K3 b - -',This is an important moment. As stated above the more pieces remain on the board the less great will be the drawing tendency of the opposite coloured bishops. Andersson therefore keeps both rooks on.

against this. The text threatens to trap the enemy bishop after 26. e4 thus inducing the reply."
501,21,6,2f5,b'6r1/pr4p1/2p1k3/2Rbpp1p/PP5P/5PP1/3BP3/R3K3 w - -',At a stroke Black's potential kingside counterplay has been eliminated.
502,21,7,3f4,b'8/pr1r4/2p1k1p1/2Rb1p1p/PP2pP1P/2B1K1P1/4P3/3R4 b - -',"An interesting choice. On the principle of ""two weaknesses"" White would normally try to keep the kingside open so as to have the possibility of infiltrating with his king. However this would mean his pieces being tied to the defence of the pawn on f3. Instead Andersson closes the kingside but thereby frees his hands to concentrate on the queenside weaknesses. His plan now is to transfer his king over to defend the b4-pawn and then attack the a-pawn with all his might bringing his rooks to a6 and a5 and placing the bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal."
503,21,8,3Rb2,b'8/pr1r1k2/2p3p1/2Rb1p1p/PP1BpP1P/4K1P1/1R2P3/8 b - -',As always Andersson is in no hurry. Before the king can leave e3 he needs to ensure that Black has no dangerous discoveries with his bishop from d5 (e.g. 33. Kd2? Ba2) so Andersson removes his last piece from a white square.
504,21,9,Kf7,b'8/pr1r1k2/2p3p1/2Rb1p1p/PP1BpP1P/6P1/1R1KP3/8 w - -',Now 34 ..Bb3? just loses a pawn after 35. Rxc6+ Kf7 36. Rxb3 Rxd4+ 37. Ke3 e.g. 37 ..Rdxb4 38. Rxb4 Rxb4 39. Rc7+ Ke6 40. Rxa7 etc.
505,21,10,Ke6,b'8/pr1r4/2p1k1p1/2Rb1p1p/PP1BpP1P/2K3P1/1R2P3/8 w - -',Black has no counterplay and can only mark time.

507,21,12,4Bc5,b'8/pr1r1k2/R1p3p1/2Bb1p1p/PP2pP1P/2K3P1/3RP3/8 b - -',"Again we see the ""repetition trick"". White gains time on the clock and underlines Black's helplessness."
508,21,13,4e3,b'8/pr1r1k2/R1p3p1/2Bb1p1p/PP2pP1P/K3P1P1/2R5/8 b - -',Getting another pawn off a light square and securing the post d4 for the bishop.
509,21,14,4Bd4,b'8/prr2k2/R1p3p1/3b1p1p/PP1BpP1P/K3P1P1/2R5/8 b - -',Now it is clear that the a7-pawn is doomed.
510,21,15,4Kb2,b'8/p1rr1k2/R1p3p1/2Rb1p1p/PP1BpP1P/4P1P1/1K6/8 b - -',Once again a typical Andersson touch. There is nothing wrong with the immediate 48 Rca5 but nor is there any hurry to play this move. Consequently Andersson just improves his king by bringing it to the more central square c3. It has done its job on a3 by clearing the c-file for the rook to come to c5; now the king returns to a more central position.
511,21,16,Rb6,b'8/p2r1k2/Rrp3p1/2Rb1p1p/PP1BpP1P/2K1P1P1/8/8 w - -',Black finally wearies of shuffling his rook to and fro along the seventh rank and instead forces the exchange of a pair of rooks but it is too late to make any difference.
512,21,17,Ba2,b'8/p2r1k2/R1p3p1/5p1p/PP1BpP1P/2K1P1P1/b7/8 w - -',"Now he loses c6 but there was no defence anyway. White will just capture on a7 with the bishop maintain
his grip and gradually advance the a-pawn."
513,21,18,5Rxc6,b'8/p2r1k2/2R3p1/5p1p/PP1BpP1P/2K1P1P1/b7/8 b - -',A superb piece of patient systematic technique by Andersson. It is difficult to believe that the starting position of this ending is lost for Black but even harder to pinpoint a clear or decisive error on his part!
514,22,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"(Notes by GM Ray Keene.) Kramnik the defending world champion scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; Peter Leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. This is only the third time in the entire history of the World Championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. The game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. Despite consistent exchanges throughout the game Kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. Taking no account of material sacrifices it was Kramnik’s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. This outstanding game the best of the match recalled the classic fifth game won by Petrosian against Botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought White a classic victory. ""I had to give everything especially at the end to win against such an opponent. Peter Leko is an incredible defender. For me it was more difficult than my match against Kasparov in the year 2000"" said Kramnik after the game. Leko said in conclusion: ""It was a very hard fight. In the end it was not enough for me to win the title. I'm disappointed but I'm looking forward to the future. I'm 25 years old and I hope to get a new chance to become world champion.""

His bishop  continues to attack the weakness on a6 whilst his queen's rook will take control of the open c-file. Once one sees the results of the exchange 22. Rxd7 it is not so hard to see its merits. The real difficulty of the move lies in the fact that it would not normally enter most players' heads to exchange such a good knight for such an apparently inferior bishop.

The theory of this ending has recently been updated following some detailed researches by a Swiss player Johannes Steckner augmented by Grandmasters Muller Dautov Dvoretsky and others. I can recommend the section in the second edition of Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual for a detailed summary of their findings."

It seems rather illogical to switch the rook back in front of the enemy passed pawn but with his king so far advanced amongst White's kingside pawns Black has just enough play to draw. Fine's analysis in which neither I nor my silicon assistants have been able to find any flaws runs as follows: 50. a4 f5 51. Ra2 Ra5 52. Bc3 f4 53. Bb4 Ra8 54. Ra3 Rb8+!

Another try here is Sadler's 53. Ra3 (instead of 53. Kb4). The idea is to try to induce Black to exchange on g3 which stabilizes White's kingside. Even so it seems that Black can hold after 53. ...Ra8 54. Kd4  Rd8+! (not 54. ...Ra5 55. Ke4 h5 56. gxf4 Kxh4 57. Ra1 and White looks to be winning) 55.

Kb2 (51 Kb3 Rb1+ is the line examined in the note to White's 47th) and it seems to me that White is now winning. Compared with the line after White's 47th here the white rook is excellently placed on c2 because he can always answer Black's .. .f5-f4 break with Rc4. This appears to hold up Black's counterplay enough for White to win e.g. 51. ...Re1 52. a4 Re6 53. Kb3 Kf3 (53. ...Rb6+ 54. Ka3 f4 is still met by 55. Rc4 e.g. 55. ..g5 56. a5 a6 57.

Kd7 and 63 ...Rc8+? 64. Kb7 both lose at once. Similarly 63 ...Re2? fails to 64. a8Q since the rook on a2 is defended; the Re2 idea only works when White has brought his rook to c2 where it is undefended.

Moving the rook off the e-file for example with 67. ...Rh8 deprives Black of the resource ..Re2 so now 68. Kb7 Rh7+ 69. Kb8 Rh8+ 70. Rc8 wins. The only other king move is 67. ...Kh2 but now the king does not attack the f-pawn and Black is a crucial tempo too slow after 68. Kb7 Re2 69. R6 Re8 70. a8Q Rxa8 71. Kxa8 Kg2 72. Rc2 etc.

In return for the blockaded hanging pawns on c4 and d5 Black can hope to attack the backward white pawn on b2. I suspect Kasparov was deterred from this by the awkward position of his rook on c5; it cannot get to the b-file very easily since it is tied to the defence of d5 whilst bringing the black king over to d6 to free the rook from its defensive duties would run into e3-e4. Kasparov therefore keeps the pawn structure intact and hopes to use the open c-file as the basis for some counterplay especially if his d-pawn falls.

A further point in his favour is the presence of the black pawn on b5 which has weakened the queenside dark squares especially c5.

reason which is that when analysing most strong players tend to effect a pawn exchange such as that on h4 by simply scooping the g5- and g3-pawns off the board in a single motion of the hand rather than physically playing the moves 46. ... g5xh4 and 47. g3xh4. As a result the position after Black's 46th move does not physically arise on the board when one is analysing which makes it even harder to spot the idea of 47. Ng2 !! . The point of Karpov's idea is that after 47. gxh4 his king would not have a way into the black position.

632,26,20,5Nc7+,b'8/2N5/p3kpK1/1p6/1P1P4/P4P2/8/3b4 b - -',By comparison with the previous note the analogous line 56. Nxf6 Bxf3 57. Ne8 would be met by 57. ...Kd5 and Black has enough counterplay to draw e.g. 58. Nc7+ Kxd4 59. Nxa6 Kc3 and White loses his a-pawn.
633,26,21,Kd6,b'8/8/N2k1K2/1p6/1P1P4/P4b2/8/8 w - -',White now has two extra pawns but he cannot stop Black obtaining counterplay by ... Kd5.
634,26,22,6Kf4,b'8/8/N7/1p1k4/1P1P1K2/P4b2/8/8 b - -',This tempo gain allows White to consolidate his two-pawn advantage but it turns out that it is still very hard to convert.
635,26,23,Bc6,b'8/8/2b5/1pN5/1PkP4/P3K3/8/8 w - -',Black plays his bishop over the e4-square so that a later Ne4 does not block the bishop's control of d5. White has managed to hold onto his material but it is hard to make progress with the d-pawn without allowing the black king into b3.
636,26,24,Bg2,b'8/8/8/1p6/1PkP4/P2NK3/6b1/8 w - -',The immediate 63 ...Kb3? is bad because after 64. Ne5 Bd5 65. Kd3 Kxa3 66. Kc3 White has consolidated and the black king is out of play. White will simply bring his knight round to e3 and set his passed pawn in motion. Black must time his active counterplay for a moment when his king can eliminate both white  Queenside pawns allowing him then to sacrifice the bishop for the remaining white pawn.
637,26,25,Kc3,b'8/8/8/1p2N3/1P1P4/P1k1K3/6b1/8 w - -',64. ...Kb3? is again bad because of 65. Kd3 but waiting tactics by 64. ...Kd5 were also possible. It seems that White can then win if he can arrange the move a3-a4 e.g. 65. Kd3 Be4+ 66. Kc3 Bf5 67. Nd3 Bg4 68. Nc5 Bc8 69. a4 bxa4 70. Nxa4 and the tablebase confirms that this is a win for White However in this line it is still not clear how White makes progress after 67 ...Bd7 68. Nc5 Be8.
638,26,26,Bb7,b'8/1b2N3/8/1p6/1PkP4/P3K3/8/8 w - -',It seems that this move definitely loses. The critical line was 66 ...Bh1! 67. Nf5 Kd5. This position was the subject of an exhaustive analysis by Marin who in turn built upon a previous analysis by Timman. Whereas the latter had claimed that White is winning this position Marin found a key improvement for Black and after several pages of analysis of this position he concluded that White cannot win despite his two extra pawns. One key point is that Timman's 68. Ng3 Bg2 69. Kf2 Bh3 70. Ne2 can be met by 70. ...Bg4! 71. Ke3 Bxe2! 72. Kxe2 Kxd4 when the pawn ending results in a draw.
639,26,27,Bg2,b'8/8/8/1p3N2/1PkP4/P3K3/6b1/8 w - -',67 ...Kd5 poses only slightly greater problems as Marin demonstrates: 68. Kd3 Ba8 69. Ne3+ Ke6 70. Nd1 and once the knight reaches c3 Black is helpless as his king is driven back from d5 and White is preparing a3-a4.
640,26,28,7Nd6,b'8/8/3N4/8/kP1P4/P3K3/6b1/8 b - -',A magnificent endgame despite the errors. Karpov's 47. Ng2!! is one of the most famous moves in world championship match history.
641,27,0,Kc7,b'2b5/2k3p1/p1p2pBp/P2p4/1P1P4/5PP1/7P/4K3 w - -',In almost any endgame it is a significant advantage to have the more active king and this is a perfect illustration of that rule applying in a bishop endgame. Black has two weak pawns on a6 and c6 to the defence of which his bishop will be tied down. Meanwhile White will penetrate with his king on the weakened light squares on the kingside (two weaknesses!}. It seems unlikely that he should be able to do so but with the aid of zugzwang his king makes it all the way to h8. Finally we see another typical device in minor piece endings - the sacrifice of a piece to net a winning collection of pawns. Averbakh's handling of the endgame is technically flawless.
642,27,1,4g4,b'2b5/2k3p1/p1p2pBp/P2p4/1P1P2P1/5P2/7P/4K3 b - -',Fixing weaknesses - now the enemy kingside pawns are fixed in their place and White can prepare to infiltrate them with his king.
643,27,2,5Bd3,b'2b2k2/6p1/p1p2p1p/P2p3K/1P1P2P1/3B1P2/7P/8 b - -',Tying the black bishop down to the defence of a6.
644,27,3,5h3,b'2b5/5kp1/p1p2p1p/P2p3K/1P1P2P1/3B1P1P/8/8 b - -',Zugzwang. Now Black's king must give way since 55. ...Bb7 results in his bishop being completely immobilized after 56. Bf5.
645,27,4,5Bf1,b'2b3k1/6p1/p1p2pKp/P2p4/1P1P2P1/5P1P/8/5B2 b - -',Preparing a further zugzwang.

647,27,6,6Kh8,b'2b2k1K/6p1/p1p2pBp/P2p4/1P1P2P1/5P1P/8/8 b - -',White's king has made it to the end of the earth. Now the next stage is to force Black to undefend the pawn on g7.

649,27,8,6Be8,b'2b1Bk1K/6p1/p1p2p1p/P2p1P2/1P1P2P1/7P/8/8 b - -',A beautifully elegant final blow. The bishop sacrifices itself on an empty square (always the most aesthetic form of sacrifice) in order to destroy the black kingside pawn structure.
650,27,9,h5,b'2b1k3/6K1/p1p2p2/P2p1P1p/1P1P2P1/7P/8/8 w - -',Desperation. If 67. ...Ke7 68. h4! (not 68 Kxh6?? Kf7 with a draw) 68. ...Bd7 and now simply 69. g5! and the f-pawn will promote.

653,27,12,8b5,b'8/5kP1/p2K1P2/PP1p1b2/3P4/8/8/8 b - -',"Now the a-pawn will decide. A beautifully elegant ending by the great Soviet endgame expert and a highly
instructive demonstration of some typical endgame ideas."

671,28,17,3Qd3#,b'r5nr/pR4p1/3k1p2/qpN1p3/4B3/3QB2P/5P2/1R4K1 b - -',and here after a losing start i managed to win my opponent. Any comments and/or advice is appreciated:)
672,29,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So as usual I kick things off with the King's Pawn Opening.
673,29,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',While I know all about this move and am certainly ok with handling it I thought that black would respond with the Siclian.  But in this case it really doesn't matter nor should it since I know what to do here.
674,29,2,f6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I don't why black played this.  It's not a developing and does not help to control the center.  Therefore as far as I know this move is out of book.
675,29,3,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',So I just continue with development in such a way that I will eventually castle Kingside.  Although really I should just do this by my fourth move if possible.
676,29,4,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This time I know what he wants.  In this position my opponent is attempting to force an exchange and cause problems with the idea of 4...Ne7 followed by ...d5.  Those are his intentions but I am not going to allow that.
677,29,5,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Therefore although I stated that white should castle this is an exception.  And in fact that's why this move is better.  In addition now there are two occasions where he has only advanced his pawn one space so this how I decided to respond.  I actually should have done it earlier the entire opening transposed into a philidors defense.
678,29,6,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',At this point black is intending to win a free pawn because of this move but I won't allow that.  Instead I will force several exchanges in a chain of events here.  BTW a chain of events is an occasion where one thing leads to another or where just one road leads to rome.  That's the case here because white and I are going to exchange like crazy so that in the next two moves four exchanges will be made.
679,29,7,Qf3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',This where what should have been aggression with a purpose inadvertently became unsound due to lack of concentration actually.  While it may seem like it which was the case in past games as most of you know I was not intending to mate in one.  But that's simply what it looks.  Better was what I actually had in mind and had wanted to play which was 7.Qd5.  Yes it also poses a mate threat but the idea was that no matter what I would be to play Qf7+.  The idea being is to expose black's K in a very unusual way.  7...Qd7 (indirectly forced) 8.Qf7+ Qxf7 9.Bxf7.  Edit: But now I miscalculated as well and that would have been bad.  That's because it would have lost material because after 9.Bxf7?? while the K gets exposed black plays 9...Kxf7 I essentially lose a piece in exchange.  That's even worse because losing material is actually worse exposing your K.  So I would wind up making the exact same mistake during the misstep against blitzkov.  Something that didn't even come into consideration.  At least I now learned that there is more then meets when what you think is good is actually bad.  This is something that a mentor and I have gone over but is the only thing that I am still forgetting.  The good thing is that this is the way for me to remember once and for all.
680,29,8,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Of course white is just going to continue developing in a non chalant manner and why wouldn't he.  Eventually chicoboy is going to punish me for my last move.
681,29,9,Bg5,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq -',However unlike before when I've made cheapo's this time I'm just going to continue developing.  And I'll start by pinning his N with my DSB.
682,29,10,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq -',And this is the move that I had anticipated in response.  But that's also what I wanted.
683,29,11,O-O,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',That's because as noted on move 4 I finally take advantage of my opportunity to castle.  So in this case one road did not lead to Rome yet.  But I have to be carefully not to jinx it because that will eventually change when I make another reckless move due to miscalculation.  
684,29,12,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',Now this is where black punishes white for 7.Qf3!?  This time I have no choice but to accept the consequences for my actions.  At first I considered taking with 10.Qxg4 but I ruled that out almost immediately as then he retakes with ...NXQ.  A move that back some time ago I actually could have missed believe it or not.  At least I spotted it very quickly.
685,29,13,1Qe3,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',I had several outposts but I feel that this is the best one as I'm now putting pressure on the e file.  I care more about the e and d files then any other files because I believe that pressuring it also puts pressure on black's center.  After this game and analyzing it I realize that it was never going to be the case but it's always worth a try because that's how I usually pressure the center like that.  My goal is to always make it difficult for my opponent to control the center since central control is extremely important.  Sometimes I get too much confidence from one move and feel that it automatically gives me an advantage which isn't always the case.
686,29,14,1h6,b'r2qk2r/ppp1b1p1/3p1n1p/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',But he counterattacks with this move.  This time however black is not punishing white.  I can escape but since I'm ahead and to delay and hopefully prevent anything worse I will force an exchange.  At this point the stress has ended and it's the next day.  But don't let your guard down.  I am going to make a different mistake that will seal my fate.  Before any of that happens there will be a few more moves free of any inaccuracies including an exchange.
687,29,15,1Nc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp3p1/3p1b1p/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',"At this point I'm only interested in completing my development since a main goal in chess is to ""develop develop develop"" as schakertjie would say.  In addition this is excellent timing because it does not give away material.  It's just that I did a little differently then should have due to the sudden changes as noted earlier.  But at least for now my head is back in the game and I'm back to my normal self.  Let's see how long this lasts."
688,29,16,1Bg5,b'r2qk2r/ppp3p1/3p3p/4p1b1/2B1P1b1/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',I see that upon completing development he decides to drive after my Q.  But aside from that what does he really want?  That's the question.
689,29,17,1Qg3,b'r2qk2r/ppp3p1/3p3p/4p1b1/2B1P1b1/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',"Well I do not know what it is but I won't allow it.  Instead I decide to punish black by reattacking him.  Because if your opponent goes after your piece then ""two can play that game.""  One certainly has the right to fight back and that's the case here.  It's the saying that someone once said which is ""You attacked me and I fought back."""
690,29,18,1Qd7,b'r3k2r/pppq2p1/3p3p/4p1b1/2B1P1b1/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',At first I wasn't sure but I was just going to keep on studying the position until I found out why.  And that's because your opponent always has a reason for making a move if that reason is bad.  Well as it turns out black had a very good reason for moving here.  In this position his goal is to do something very unusual which I've done in a couple games.  The idea is to complete development by castling and actually that's a very good idea.  I actually saw how that was by GM Judit Polgar in her video on how she surpassed Bobby Fischer's Record in her game against Anand.  Normally I would have castled much earlier but there's nothing wrong with move at all.  In fact I did something like this in two of my past games.
691,29,19,1Rfd1,b'r3k2r/pppq2p1/3p3p/4p1b1/2B1P1b1/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',?? At this point I'm just trying to even more pressure on black's center while bringing my R over for additional.  But there's really nothing to worry.  It's just that Jack Stockel has advised me to count how many pieces you have vs how many the opponent has for coverage.  And if it's about equal or your opponent has another piece there it's a good idea to bring something else to the table.  However this move is actually a blunder and not just an inaccuracy because it's going to lose a R for his B.  I should have thought about that before moving here but then again I'm beginning to feel different affects from the sudden changes.  That's just when I thought that it was all over and had completely recovered but then this happens.
692,29,20,1Bf4,b'r3k2r/pppq2p1/3p3p/4p3/2B1Pbb1/2N3Q1/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 w kq -',But black is still punishing me for bringing out the Q too early.  I did not realize that a punishment could last this long until now.
693,29,21,1Qd3,b'r3k2r/pppq2p1/3p3p/4p3/2B1Pbb1/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b kq -',Forced because if instead 15.Qh4?? white loses his Q after 15...g5.  I took that right into calculation.  Otherwise I would have made that blunder believe it or not since it was my first instinct.  Proof that your first instinct is not always correct. 
694,29,22,a6,b'r3k2r/1ppq2p1/p2p3p/4p3/2B1Pb2/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w kq -',I don't why black played this.  His Q wasn't in danger because had he not played so I decided to play 17.Bb5 he can defend with 17...c6.
695,29,23,1g3,b'r3k2r/1ppq2p1/p2p3p/4p3/2B1Pb2/2NQ2P1/PPP2P1P/3R2K1 b kq -',Because I'm behind I decide to become very aggressive and not in an unsound manner at all.  While I know that is not just going let me win his DSB sooner or later I will force it since I'm behind.  That's because when you're behind or in a losing position you can afford to make the most aggressive moves since there's nothing else to lose.  At least you're doing what you can to catch up on material or even pull a swindle.  While that usually doesn't work occasionally it does and it's worth trying as opposed to just giving up.  I mean that was my main weakness when I was still a beginner.
696,29,24,1Bg5,b'r3k2r/1ppq2p1/p2p3p/4p1b1/2B1P3/2NQ2P1/PPP2P1P/3R2K1 w kq -',So after this retreat I am going to wait until the right moment for me to win his B for one of my P and then catch up.  But this requires patience otherwise he can just pull back again and white would lose rather quickly.  Why?  It would become a different form of unsound aggression which wouldn't achieve anything except nearly open up my K and leave it vulnerable.  And that is something that I won't allow.
697,29,25,1Qf3,b'r3k2r/1ppq2p1/p2p3p/4p1b1/2B1P3/2N2QP1/PPP2P1P/3R2K1 b kq -',While it might seem like a ?! move with a different form of unsound aggression that can easily be driven off it can't.  Yes he can easily defend against this mating but that's what I actually wanted and had expected.  That's because of what I have in plan after he drives my Q off this time.  So it's actually anything but obvious.  However I wanted to start it off as obvious because this pretty much forces the plan to work.

And even better for me was that I did it now as opposed to later which was actually a good mistake and miscalculation.  The reason being is that I left his K vulnerable without blundering away any more material.
701,29,29,2Qg6,b'r2k1r2/1ppq2p1/p2p2Qp/4p1b1/2B1P3/2N3P1/PPP2P1P/3R2K1 b - -',So now that I see a weakness I try to take advantage of it with this move.  Of course what good is it really going to do.  But my goal was to ironically put pressure on the f file.  Instead white just shot himself in the foot in one respect.  And that's because he's going to do that himself.

706,29,34,2Na4,b'r2k1r2/1p1q2pQ/p1pp3p/4p1b1/NPB1P3/6P1/P1P2P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Knights should not be placed on the rim but when you have a plan that requires it and you're behind like this then I say go for it and don't even worry about cheapos or the basics for that matter.  That's because falling behind like this is usually a sign of bad omen so one should do just about anything to pull a swindle.  Going for a family fork is a way to do things but this as expected is something that black will not allow.  BTW a family fork is actually a 3 way fork or better is to say a piece or pawn that attacks three pieces or pawns.  But it specifically involves the Q K and a R.
707,29,35,2Kc7,b'r4r2/1pkq2pQ/p1pp3p/4p1b1/NPB1P3/6P1/P1P2P1P/3R2K1 w - -',! Not surprisingly he sees my intention and decides use his K as a weapon.  Normally that should wait until the endgame but this is an exception.  Because if he played say ...Kb8 it would prevent a family fork.  But there would certainly be a fork at the very completely making up for the material as that would win a R for my N.  Now my opponent is not going to allow so this was best.
708,29,36,2a3,b'r4r2/1pkq2pQ/p1pp3p/4p1b1/NPB1P3/P5P1/2P2P1P/3R2K1 b - -',Even though we're not at that phase I decided to treat this as though it were an endgame and the reason being is because played a move that you usually see in an endgame.  Now in an endgame it's usually a good idea to connect your pawns like this as it gives them extra protection and helps them to promote.  So this was a power of influence.  Although the timing of it is bad.  Black only did that because he was at risk of losing material.  But I am just trying to figure out how to get something back by playing unusual lines.

Either be passive and allow him to take first.  Or be aggressive and take right away.  I decide to be aggressive as that should and will shortly give me an opportunity to win something back.  By doing this I explore my mind and stretch my imagination so that I have more options later on.  And this believe it or not will increase my concentration even more.

In this case his DSB+a pawn for one of my pawns.  A good example of how to make comeback.  So knowing this fact is why I played this move.  And had I not been aggressive by being the first to take I certainly would have overlooked this.  The reason that I now have compensation is because his DSB has no where to go as this is a half pin.  In other words it's not a pin the way you'd think of a pin where something is ""pinned down"".  But his DSB is just in a natural position where it can't move."

The only problem is that this move is the losing blunder as we're about to see.  But in reality if this is the move that costs me the game I don't mind.  The reason being is that in order then to stay in the game white would have to give up a N so I would fall just as far behind.  At first however I did not realize that this loses quickly until I really studied the position.  But let's say it did at least I'm standing my ground by keeping material safe this time after giving things away earlier."

Now it might not have led to the lost immediately but what affected this game was the sudden change in my schedule.  That produced a lot of stress in this game you saw the aftermath of that.  By the time I calmed down and everything settled down (so all said and done) I was already two points behind.  But still I never gave up until now.  And that confidence helped me to get something back and compensate for lost material.  That's because I did not resign earlier.

In this game I was the exchange and a pawn up.  You would think that it would have been a gift from heaven from Freddy wouldn't you?  A real chance for me to get that elusive victory against Expert opposition and earn myself the username TheBlackQueen.  The reality was different.  Passivitis set in and allowed Freddy to mass all his pieces around Henry.  My own pieces were fairly close to Henry but were very poorly co-ordinated in defense.  When playing Freddy and Ion I am sometimes caught between two stools to be aggressive prematurely - i.e. to use Glenda as a Lone Wolf or to dig in and become passive and hopefully ride out the storm.  I tried to get aggressive with Freddy and put Glenda on a4 preparing a possibility of a queenside mating attack.  Unfortunately this move was a waste of tempo and Glenda would have been better served on h1 to enable Henry to get sanctuary on the queenside and to stop the Wicked Witch and her henchmen pouring in via the kingside.  I will let you the Inquest Jury decide how I should have prevented this invasion and converted my material advantage to victory.  But before you decide here is how the action unfolded."

811,35,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This is the Center Game. I've been playing a fair bit of the Danish Gambit recently (which continues 2...exd4 3.c3) and it's become a favorite of mine over some of the more common responses to 1...e5 especially in blitz. The general theory: White gives up a pawn or two in the center in exchange for open lines and accelerated development.
812,35,1,Qf6,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',?! This overly-aggressive move receives a (?!) instead of a (?) only because it's blitz and the format favors early attacks and violent traps. Of course in any other format (or against a level-headed opponent) this move is simply inferior as it brings the Queen out far too early takes away the King Knight's best spot and doesn't really threaten anything specific.
813,35,2,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',The logical response. White develops naturally.
814,35,3,Bb4+,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/1b1PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black attempts to develop with tempo but this is easy to repel and simply gives me a free move to shore up my center.
815,35,4,c3,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/1b1PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I kick the Bishop and reinforce d4. My Queen Knight will probably be developing to d2 anyway.
816,35,5,exd4,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/1b1pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',? Black hands over his Bishop for no obvious reason.
817,35,6,Bg5,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/6B1/1b1pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',No reason to capture yet; this move allows White to develop his own Bishop with tempo.
818,35,7,Qg6,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/6q1/6B1/1b1pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',To at least gain a pawn for his lost Bishop.
819,35,8,Be2,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/6B1/1P1pq3/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White has a Bishop for two pawns and is significantly ahead in development already. Black has a passed d-pawn but it is indefensible and has no prospects--in fact my *missing* pawns are greater benefits for me because they provide beautiful open lines through the center.
820,35,9,f6,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/6B1/1P1pq3/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',? Kicking the Bishop but weakening the kingside and again denying the f6 square to his own Knight. Better was 7...d5.
821,35,10,Bh4,b'rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/1P1pq2B/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',This Bishop wants to land on the h2-b8 diagonal.
822,35,11,Nh6,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p1n/8/1P1pq2B/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq -',The Knight finally develops but it has little to do at the moment. Probably it will head for f5 at some point in the future but that would have been better accomplished by 8...Ne7.
823,35,12,O-O,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p1n/8/1P1pq2B/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',White gets his King out of the center brings his Rook into the game and unpins the Bishop at e2 so it can be transferred to d3 or c4.
824,35,13,Ng4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p2/8/1P1pq1nB/5N2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',? Black seems to be trying to mate me with as few pieces as possible. Unfortunately for him Q+N is not sufficient against all my kingside defenders. Further this move (A) delays development and (B) delays castling--with his King and Queen sharing the open e-file castling should be first on Black's mind right now. This was Black's last free move: now my lead in development (five active pieces against Black's two) allows me to take the initiative and start making threats to which Black must respond. It's been nine moves; let's see how well each side is prepared.
825,35,14,1Bc4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p2/8/1PBpq1nB/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I move to deny Black his castle (thanks to the frivolous f-pawn move). Black would love to reply with 10...d5 to kick my Bishop and open up a line for his own but he can't do it because I'm threatening to win his Queen with Re1.
826,35,15,1Qf4,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p2/8/1PBp1qnB/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',The BQ runs away with a cursory threat at h2. Better was to admit his mistake and play 10...Qg6.
827,35,16,1Bg3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p2/8/1PBp1qn1/5NB1/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',I take the opportunity to relocate my Bishop right where I want it and boot the BQ off to some less useful square. The initiative remains firmly in my hand as I use the overextended Black Queen for target practice.
828,35,17,1Qh6,b'rnb1k2r/pppp2pp/5p1q/8/1PBp2n1/5NB1/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black continues to glare at h2 but it is very well defended. His threats are empty. In the meantime I have a full contingent of pieces headed for the Black King.
829,35,18,Kf8,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5p1q/8/1PBp2n1/5NB1/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',A check and the Black King sidles out of the line of fire but now he can't move at all.
830,35,19,1Nxd4,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5p1q/8/1PBN2n1/6B1/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - -',This capture serves several purposes: I now threaten to jump in on e6 or f5 with my Knight as well as defending c6 if Black tries to develop his own Knight. In addition the move reveals an attack on Black's defenseless Ng4. Once again Black must respond to my threats instead of making his own plans.
831,35,20,1Qg5,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5p2/6q1/1PBN2n1/6B1/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - -',It looks like Black is beginning to see the severity of his situation. He moves to defend g4 and f5. I think 13...Qg6 was better though to defend e8.
832,35,21,1Qe2,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5p2/6q1/1PBN2n1/6B1/PP2QPPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',I can keep the threats coming all day. This time it's Qe7# or Qe8# (once again thanks to my Bc4 doing an admirable job of locking down the Black King). Neither 14...d4 nor 14...Qg6 is sufficient to meet both threats.
833,35,22,1Ne5,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5p2/4n1q1/1PBN4/6B1/PP2QPPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',I think this is the best Black has to offer but it's not good enough.

Not only that but Black must *still* respond to this move since I'm also jabbing at his Queen.
835,35,24,1Qg6,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5pq1/4n3/1PBN1P2/6B1/PP2Q1PP/RN2R1K1 w - -',The BQ gets out of the way and defends f7 and d8. As I've said I think she belonged here from some time ago trying to shore up all these weak light squares.
836,35,25,1fxe5,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/5pq1/4P3/1PBN4/6B1/PP2Q1PP/RN2R1K1 b - -',White's positional advantage is absolutely overwhelming. I now threaten 17.exf6 Qxf6 18.Rf1 with mate to follow: 18...Qxf1+ 19.Qxf1+ Kmoves 20.Qf7+ and so on. If 18...gxf6?? 19.Qe7# seals the deal immediately.
837,35,26,1fxe5,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/6q1/4p3/1PBN4/6B1/PP2Q1PP/RN2R1K1 w - -',? Probably Black's best shot was 16...f5. Opening the f-file like this only invites disaster (and if White is allowed to take on f6 things are just as bad).
838,35,27,1Rf1+,b'rnb2k1r/pppp2pp/6q1/4p3/1PBN4/6B1/PP2Q1PP/RN3RK1 b - -',White switches to the new open file before recapturing on e5--to retain his checking power and an irresistible initiative.

842,35,31,1Qxg7+,b'rnb4r/ppppk1Qp/4q3/8/1PBN4/6B1/PP4PP/RN3RK1 b - -',There's no need to take the Queen: White has a more important target in his sights.

844,35,33,2Qxh8+,b'rnbk3Q/pppp3p/4q3/8/1PBN4/6B1/PP4PP/RN3RK1 b - -',The material gain is obviously irrelevant: what matters is that the back rank belongs to me now. It's mate in one.
845,35,34,2Qe8,b'rnbkq2Q/pppp3p/8/8/1PBN4/6B1/PP4PP/RN3RK1 w - -',Or 20...Ke7 21.Qf8#. Black's Queen tries to sacrifice herself one last time.
846,35,35,2Bh4#,b'rnbkq2Q/pppp3p/8/8/1PBN3B/8/PP4PP/RN3RK1 b - -',And that's all she wrote. Try as she might Black's lone Queen simply could not keep up with all the threats that the coordinated White forces were able to deliver. Meanwhile the final position shows just how little Black bothered to develop. This game is a pretty clear example of how clean basic development can triumph over wild and ill-prepared attacks. I hope you enjoyed it!

The Knight at N3 does nothing except to prevent the development of his own QB. The normal course O-O followed by P-QB4 is more reasonable.

White will soon post his Knights at K5 and QB5. The best move was 12... NxN to swap off a pair of Knights.
