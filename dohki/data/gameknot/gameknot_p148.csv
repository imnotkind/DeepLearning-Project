0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi Everyone!

As my coach Ionadowman would attest I am an absolute tiger for punishment!  I am addicted to playing the big boys.  I guess it is because I feel there is everything to gain and little to lose so that is the upside of being the underdog.  I am playing in a MT called Jo against The Titans which consists of myself 3 masters and 1 grandmaster!  Sadly I did not get off to a very good start going down like a lead balloon to a mating attack from Ken who I have played 3 times before and lost the lot!  We both kick off with a double king pawn opening and then he gives me the King's Gambit with 2. f4 of which I accept.  Before I go any further here is the gameknot analysis.

1,0,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',3. Nf3 - fairly standard to avoid Qh4+.
2,0,2,h4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq h3',4. h4 - hitting at the f pawn's support.  I advance the g pawn.
3,0,3,Ne5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Ne5 - I thought he might go Ng5 which is the Allgaier Gambit sacrificing N for P in order to bring Henry out into the centre but he chooses the Kiezeritzky Gambit instead which can get really wild.
4,0,4,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5n2/3pN3/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',6. ..... d5 - to block out the white lsb's attack on f7.
5,0,5,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5n2/3PN3/2B2ppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',8. ..... 0-0 - I tuck away Henry on the kingside but alas he is not safe there!
6,0,6,Qxd5,b'rnb2rk1/ppp2pbp/8/3qN3/3P1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQ1RK1 w - -',10. ....... Qxd5 - a plethora of exchanges - black looks to be doing well but appearances can be deceptive sometimes.
7,0,7,Qd8,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/8/4N3/3P1ppP/2N5/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',11. ..... Qd8 - attacking h4.
8,0,8,bxc6,b'r1bq1rk1/p1p2pbp/2p5/8/3P1BpP/2N5/PPP3P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',13. ..... bxc6 - knight trade sadly my queenside pawns are really split and will become a target for the Wicked Witch of the West.
9,0,9,Qxh4,b'r1b2rk1/p1p2p1p/2p5/4P3/6pq/2N5/PPP3P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',15. ...... Qxh4 - Glenda grabs the h pawn.  Might as well seeing as my queenside pawns are so shattered.  However I overestimated Henry's safety at that point.
10,0,10,Bb7,b'r4rk1/pbp2p1p/2p5/4P3/3Q2pq/2N5/PPP3P1/R4RK1 w - -',16. .... Bb7 - connecting the rooks but alas I should have perhaps put Fou Leblanc on e6 instead to at least keep that a1-h8 diagonal blocked to the Wicked Witch of the West.

12,0,12,Qg5,b'r4rk1/p1p2p2/2p1bR2/4P1qp/3Q2p1/2N5/PPP3P1/5RK1 w - -',20. ...... Qg5 - Glenda has to defend but ....
13,0,13,2Qe3,b'r4rk1/p1p2pq1/2p1bR2/4P2p/4N1p1/4Q3/PPP3P1/5RK1 b - -',22. Qe3 - this move proves it will be in vain.
14,0,14,2Kh7,b'r4r2/p1p2pqk/2p1bR2/4P2p/4N1p1/4Q3/PPP3P1/5RK1 w - -',22. ..... Kh7 - to try and stop Rh6.
15,0,15,2Ng3,b'r4r2/p1p2pqk/2p1bR2/4P2p/6p1/4Q1N1/PPP3P1/5RK1 b - -',23. Ng3 - there is no way I can defend this pawn so I played Rg8 preparing Qg5 to lose the h pawn to trade queens out of trouble.  But Ken is not having that.
16,0,16,2Nf5,b'r5r1/p1p2pqk/2p1bR2/4PN1p/6p1/4Q3/PPP3P1/5RK1 b - -',"24. Nf5 - the killer there is no way I can avoid losing Glenda except by copping Old Matey.  I therefore resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as per this analysis. Variation A

24. Nf5 Qf8 
25. Rh6+ Qxh6 
26. Qxh6# 

Variation B

24. Nf5 Qg5

His mating attack was overwhelming.  Well played Ken.

Black usually won't want to play …Bb4 in this opening anyway (unless White plays some silly weakening move like b3) because the trade …Bxc3+ just helps White — pair of Bishops c3-pawn supports the center open b-file etc.

White does make the correct decision to avoid Nb5 which is just a waste of time after …Na6."
58,3,2,c5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/P1N5/1PP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq c6',! The most aggressive approach to White's slow opening play.

In particular Bg5 makes the Knight just look stupid. (…f6?! 8. Bh4 g5? 9. Nxg5!)

61,3,5,1O-O-O,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/p1b1p2p/2bpP2P/5P2/P1NB4/1PPQ2P1/2KR3R b - -',"! Knife's-edge timing. White castles at the very last moment before it would get dangerous not to meaning that Black has to wait until now before truly beginning a counter-attack.
This feel for when to make ""safe"" moves and when to push it is absolutely essential if you want to play in an aggressive style like White does in this game."
62,3,6,1a5,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/2b1p2p/p1bpP2P/5P2/P1NB4/1PPQ2P1/2KR3R w - -',? The wrong pawn. Just pushing pawns does not an attack make — you've got to try and open lines of attack (with pawn breaks for example). …b5 would instead threaten …b4 to aim at the a-pawn and guarantee Black a half-open file on the Queenside.
63,3,7,1g4,b'r2q1rk1/1p3pp1/2b1p2p/p1bpP2P/5PP1/P1NB4/1PPQ4/2KR3R b - g3',"! Now in contrast White takes direct aim at the immobile target on h6 guaranteeing that things get opened up. 
(Note that …e5 is met adequately by Ne4.)"
64,3,8,1Be7,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/2b1p2p/p2pP2P/5PP1/P1NB4/1PPQ4/2KR3R w - -',? This move goes completely against the needs of the position. Black cannot win by defending — sooner or later White's attack WILL get through. Black needs to use this time to counter-attack on the Queenside. Even if Black can't mate first s/he may be able to trade off/tie down some White pieces to defence to weaken White's attack.
65,3,9,1Rdg1,b'r2q1rk1/1p2bpp1/2b1p2p/p2pP2P/5PP1/P1NB4/1PPQ4/2K3RR b - -',White wants blood and will not be denied!

67,3,11,1exf6,b'r2q1rk1/1p2b1p1/2b1pP1p/p2p3P/5PP1/P1NB4/1PPQ4/2K3RR b - -',My first impulse was to want to maintain the pawn on e5 (with Qe2 say) but now I think White's attack is strong enough that this move is correct. Black never has time to get things going in the center and White's pawns are free to keep storming.
68,3,12,2Rge1,b'r2q1rk1/1p4p1/2b1p3/p2p2PP/3b4/P1NB4/1PPQ4/2K1R2R b - -',Other Rook moves may be better — Rg4 or Rg2 come to mind — but this move is perfectly adequate. Bh7+ is tempting but I would hate to part with such a lovely attacking piece.

72,3,16,2Nf4,b'r5k1/1p4p1/2bqp2P/p3b1P1/3p1N2/P2B4/1PPQ4/2K2R2 b - -',This move is probably necessary but I'd play hxg7! first opening the h-file for more attacking and wait to see what Black does.
73,3,17,e5,b'r5k1/1p4p1/2bq3P/p3p1P1/3p1R2/P2B4/1PPQ4/2K5 w - -',Now Black's center is starting to look a bit menacing.
74,3,18,2Rf1,b'r5k1/1p4p1/2bq3P/p3p1P1/3p4/P2B4/1PPQ4/2K2R2 b - -',?! Now though Rh4 is definitely called for — it prepares for attack on the h-file (did you all catch that the h-file is important yet?) prevents …e4 and avoids further exchanges after …Rf8.
75,3,19,2a4,b'r5k1/1p4p1/2bq3P/4p1P1/p2p4/P2B4/1PPQ4/2K2R2 w - -',? This move has nothing to do with the needs of the position. If Black wants to move a Queenside pawn s/he should play …b5 and then …b4. Otherwise …Bd5 preparing …e4 looks good to me.
76,3,20,3Qf2,b'r5k1/1p4p1/2bq3P/4p1P1/p2p4/P2B4/1PP2Q2/2K2R2 b - -',This is a good attacking move and difficult to meet (…Rf8? h7+!) BUT… when are you going to play hxg7!!!!!!???????
77,3,21,3Qf5,b'r5k1/1p4p1/3q3P/3bpQP1/p2p4/P2B4/1PP5/2K2R2 b - -',Nice — this is a better move here than hxg7 by the way — now White is clearly better.
78,3,22,3e4,b'r5k1/1p4p1/3q3P/3b1QP1/p2pp3/P2B4/1PP5/2K2R2 w - -',What else?

NEVER close lines where you're trying to attack. 
White should actually still win (an extra pawn makes up for a lot) so the question marks are not really deserved. Still with one move White basically gives up any chance of attacking the Black King for no reason at all.
Note that after 33. Qxe4 White couldn't /pay/ Black to take on h6 — …gxh6 34. gxh6 Qxh6 35. Rg1+ is suicide."
80,3,24,3g6,b'5q1k/1p4pP/6P1/8/p2pQ3/P7/1PP5/2K5 b - -',"? Again why close lines around the enemy King? Qxd4 is a much nicer way to maintain a pawn advantage since …Kxh7 just exposes Black's King.
Now Black does a great job exploiting the stalemating possibilities afforded him/her by White's own misguided pawns."
81,3,25,3Kd3,b'7k/1p4pP/6P1/8/p2pQ3/P2K4/1PP2q2/8 b - -',! Instead of ducking for cover the White King bravely ventures out to snatch pawns. Why not? — there's no risk of mate.
82,3,26,Qc8,b'2q4k/1p4pP/6P1/8/4Q3/PK6/1PP5/8 w - -',Black's checks have only managed to lose 2 more pawns… but they have brought the position much closer to stalemate which is the only escape left for Black.
83,3,27,4Kb4,b'2q4k/1p4pP/6P1/8/1K2Q3/P7/1PP5/8 b - -',I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish. Instead Qd5 looks like a sure win — White will force a Queen trade with Qg8+ sacrificing a pawn to rule out stalemate and then just push the Queenside pawns. Of course to see that you have to see the very real risk of stalemate which is far from obvious. I'd like to think that I would see this in the heat of a real game but I'm not sure I would.
84,3,28,4b6,b'2q4k/6pP/1p4P1/8/1K2Q3/P7/1PP5/8 w - -',Coyly inviting White to snatch the b-pawn — it's a threat right?
85,3,29,b5,b'5q1k/6pP/6P1/1p6/2P1Q3/P1K5/1P6/8 w - -',And now the draw is all but assured. Well played to Black.
86,3,30,4b4,b'5q1k/6pP/6P1/1p6/1PP1Q3/P1K5/8/8 b - b3',! Good keeping a sliver of winning chances alive.

190,7,10,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3BP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Do you think Nxd4 was stronger...?
191,7,11,Bxf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I have the two bishops and reasonable control of the center.  However by now it seems clear that white is going to castle queenside and try to smash black up on the kingside.  I have a good defensive bishop but I am worried white might play something like g4.
192,7,12,Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq -',I though Qh6 would have been an unpleasant harassment.  
193,7,13,1Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2NB3P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K1NR b KQ -',It now seems likely that white will play f4 and e5.
194,7,14,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2pp1p/p1np1bp1/8/4P3/2NB3P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K1NR w KQ -',Ne5 may have been stronger preparing to collect the two bishops.

197,7,17,1e6,b'r1bq1rk1/5p1p/p1nppbp1/1p6/4P3/1PNB3P/P1PQ1PP1/2KR2NR w - -',Hoping to play Bg5...

201,7,21,1Qxb4,b'r1bq1rk1/5p1p/p2pp1p1/8/1Q1bP3/1P1B3P/P1P2PP1/1K1R2NR b - -',I am not really down a pawn here because I can play Bxf2.  Alternatively Bc5 may have been a good move too.

203,7,23,1Nxe5,b'r1bq1rk1/5p1p/p2p2p1/2b1N3/4P3/1PQB3P/P1P3P1/1K1R3R b - -',Tell me if you think this knight sac was clever or arrogant...
204,7,24,Be7,b'r2q1rk1/3bbp1p/p5p1/4P3/8/1PQB3P/P1P3P1/1K1R3R w - -',Rc8 may have been the stronger but more tactical move.
205,7,25,Qc7,b'2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/p5p1/4P3/7P/1P1B4/PQP3P1/1K1R3R w - -',I am pretty sure black had some better options here but I wanted to get the queen off the d-file.  Black does have the possibility of Qa5 followed by Ba3 trying to play on the dark squares around white's king.
206,7,26,2Rdc1,b'2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/p5p1/4P3/7P/1P1B4/PQP3P1/1KR4R b - -',This looks like a very weak move; the c-file is only semi-open and white's c2 pawn is looking secure enough without the rook.  Nor does C4 look playable for white... 
207,7,27,2hxg6,b'2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/6P1/4P3/p7/1P1B4/PQP3P1/1KR4R b - -',I remember having a good reason for not taking FxG but I cannot recall...  Do you agree that HxG is stronger...? 
208,7,28,2e6,b'2r2rk1/2qbbp2/4P1p1/8/p7/1P1B4/PQP3P1/1KR4R b - -',Black is suddenly in dire straits with the threat of Qh8#.
209,7,29,2f6,b'2r2rk1/2qbb3/4Ppp1/8/p7/1P1B4/PQP3P1/1KR4R w - -',So I am forced to sac a bishop.  Here at move 28 white looks to be winning...
210,7,30,3cxb3,b'2r2rk1/3qb3/5pB1/8/8/1P6/PQ4P1/1KR4R b - -',White's king appears to be quite secure to long as white can maintain control of the b1-h7 diagonal.  I did not want to allow white the crushing Rh7.
211,7,31,3Bf3,b'5r2/4b1k1/4qp2/8/8/1P3B2/PQ4P1/1KR5 b - -',And here white abandons that crucial diagonal...
212,7,32,3Bd6,b'5r2/6k1/3bqp2/8/8/1P3B2/PQ4P1/1KR5 w - -',I am trying to untangle my pieces and get some sort of attack going perhaps with Be5.
213,7,33,Rc8,b'2r5/6k1/3bqp2/8/8/1P3B2/P1Q3P1/1KR5 w - -',Although black is down two pawns I have finally regained the initiative; white has no playable checks.
214,7,34,Qf5+,b'2r5/6k1/3b1p2/5q2/8/1P3B2/P2Q2P1/1KR5 w - -',I think this was the right time to play this check but please let me know if you see a stronger continuation in this highly-tactical position.
215,7,35,Rxc1,b'8/6k1/3b1p2/5q2/8/1P3B2/PK1Q2P1/2r5 w - -',Time was running low and I was mostly trying to keep the initiative but I would be curious to know if there was a knockout blow here...
216,7,36,Ba3+,b'8/6k1/5p2/5q2/8/bP3B2/P2Q2P1/2K5 w - -',A terrible blunder; Bf4 would have won the queen.  But it was a blitz game and both players had around 30 seconds left.
217,7,37,Qf5,b'8/6k1/5p2/5q2/8/bP3B2/P2QK1P1/8 w - -',I am trying to make sure white has no checks; time was so low that each move had to be made within two or three seconds...
218,7,38,4Qe3,b'8/6k1/5p2/5q2/8/bP2QB2/P3K1P1/8 b - -',A defensive move from white; black's king remains secure.
219,7,39,Qd6,b'8/6k1/3q1p2/2b5/8/1PQ2B2/P5P1/5K2 w - -',I think the idea here was just to hang on to the bishop and try for a win on time...
220,7,40,4Qc4,b'8/6k1/3q1p2/2b5/2Q5/1P3B2/P5P1/5K2 b - -',Now there is a threat of white playing Qg4#.
221,7,41,4Be3,b'8/6k1/3q1p2/8/2Q5/1P2bB2/P5P1/5K2 w - -',An odd-looking defensive move played under severe time pressure.
222,7,42,Bg5,b'8/6k1/3q1p2/6b1/6Q1/1P3B2/P5P1/5K2 w - -',And once again white has no useful checks.
223,7,43,Qe5+,b'8/6k1/5p2/4q1b1/1P4Q1/5B2/P5PK/8 w - -',And in this position white ran out of time up by two pawns but unable to keep up enough pressure to win on time.  I had about 9 seconds on my clock...Please let me know what you think of this game.  Thanks Omar.

403,15,11,Rxf8,b'1n3rk1/5ppp/pp6/8/2P3n1/PNN5/1P4PP/6K1 w - -',27. .... Rxf8?? - I give this move two question marks because I made it so automatically.  In the endgame it should have been Henry going to this square and not my rook and my rook should have kept on the c column putting pressure on that weak pawn on c4.  Thankfully my opponent allows my advanced knight to manoeuvre round and wreak havoc on white's queenside pawns.
404,15,12,3Nb1,b'1n3rk1/5ppp/p7/2N5/2n5/P6P/1P4P1/1N4K1 b - -',31. Nb1 - Nd3 would have protected the b2 pawn but then my rook would have gone to d8 and chased it off.
405,15,13,Rc8,b'1nr3k1/5ppp/p7/2N5/P7/7P/1n4P1/1N4K1 w - -',32. .... Rc8 - after this move Steve waved the white flag after my rook on c8 chases away the defender of the pawn on a5 leaving my pawn on a6 the possible glory of Glendadom.  Steve does not wish to see this and so I ended up with nearly 6 rating points in the bank.  Nice.

523,21,45,2Rxd4,b'1k3r2/1p3ppp/p1P5/8/3r1R2/4n3/P5PP/R5K1 w - -',Black is trying for 24. Rxd4 Nc2 or some other series of moves.  At any rate White can't afford to take the rook.
524,21,46,2cxb7,b'1k3r2/1P3ppp/p7/8/3r1R2/4n3/P5PP/R5K1 b - -',A terrible move.  It doesn't attack the king and evidently White has forgotten that the rook on f4 is undefended.
525,21,47,2Rxf4,b'1k3r2/1P3ppp/p7/8/5r2/4n3/P5PP/R5K1 w - -',Black hasn't.
526,21,48,2Rb1,b'1k3r2/1P3ppp/p7/8/5r2/4n3/P5PP/1R4K1 b - -',White left without too many moves has to protect the pawn.
527,21,49,2Rf1+,b'1k3r2/1P3ppp/p7/8/8/4n3/P5PP/1R3rK1 w - -',Black has pieces to burn and wants White's last piece off the board.

650,27,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

We have all been told that moving the king early in the opening is tantamount to suicide.  Just remember my Fried Fox Pork Chop attempt with the Master Mater in which Henry was duly hunted down and fried!  I do end up moving Henry onto the third rank on move 12 against a Master called David who is of similar calibre to Freddy.  I do lose the game eventually - it is just sooo like some of my better losses against Freddy.  Anyhow I end up playing against a Sicilian and on move 3 I decided to deviate a bit.  Here is the computer analysis of the game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15521530&rnd=0.37983951781390546

651,27,1,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',2. Nc3 - I normally play Nf3 here but decided to have a bit of a change.

If you have been following my annotation about Pawn Fork Part 1 you will notice that I made a Bad Draw Offer because of planless play in a won position.  However I felt so much better after this game because my opponent was the same opponent that I gave that draw to.  I ended up with a two pawn advantage in the late stages of the middlegame but kept my eyes firmly averted from the Offer Draw button and somehow worked out how to gain a much needed victory to get my Class A status back.  My opponent kicks off with c4 which is the English Opening and you can follow the action with the following link to Gameknot Analysis.

This ensures that at the very least white must give up her rook for Glenda.  This is exactly what happens.  It is amazing that at the sight of a big black queen how many opponents wave that white flag.  Gail duly waved it as soon as Glenda appeared.  Gail would have been a whole rook and pawn to the bad and my rook would have no trouble in cleaning up the white pawns and then checkmating the WK.  I hope this will help if you do get stuck in a won position but you are wondering just how to convert it.  I hope you have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

Here by playing d4 and f4 White has voluntarily handed Black the central light squares — especially e4. Black should have grabbed those squares immediately with either ...Nf6 or ...d5.
Although the idea of weak and strong color complexes is a pretty advanced one I think most players at the 1500 level would still see d5/Nf6 because they stop White from building a huge center. This is where it becomes so important to always be thinking flexibly and not playing on autopilot even as early as move 2."
850,39,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1P2/5N2/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',?! White has his/her own autopilot going here — s/he is so intent on playing the Stonewall that not even the dominating central position brought on by e4! is enough to tempt him/her away from it. Thus we head back into normal Stonewall lines.
851,39,3,c3,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1pn1pn2/8/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the essence of the Colle/Stonewall — White sets up bulwarks on d4 and f4 which keep e5 in a vicegrip while leaving d5 and e4 entirely under Black's control. White will castle play Ne5 and play for an all-out attack on h7 with moves such as g4-g5 Rf3-h3 Qh5 and Bxh7+ frequently playing their parts. White hopes that the blocked-up center will make it hard for Black to get pieces over to the defence. This kind of attack can be devastating against the unsuspecting Black player who may underestimate White's offensive capabilities.Of course if White is not able to make the attack work then the Queenside pieces will be useless and the light squares will be desperately weak leading to a very real danger of having zero play. 
852,39,4,Ng4,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/3P1Pn1/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',"? It is hard to see what the point of this move is.
Black should again take the e4-square under control with ...d5 followed by developing with …Be7. As …Ng4  neither controls e4 (in fact it actively weakens Black's control of that square) nor develops a new pieces it should not have even been under consideration.

The best explanation I can find is that Black wanted to play …f5 which is admittedly a very useful move — it controls e4 blocks the Bd3 and rules out a future f5 from White — but this should not have been a realistic goal. White has several ways to rule out …f5 (even if in the game White did not decide to do so).
"
853,39,5,O-O,b'r2qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/3P1Pn1/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"? Autopilot. Chess is about thinking people! Yes even during the opening there is a lot to think about.
Here Black has a) declared his intention to play …f5 which would be very annoying to White b) moved his Knight a second time onto a vulnerable square and c) completely given up control of e4. Playing 0-0 shows a blissful disregard for those crucial elements of the position.
Although I can't see any way to exploit the discovered attack on the Knight to win material we can use it to win time and/or space: either 7. Ng5 Nf6 8. e4 or 7. Ne5 Ngxe5 fxe5 would leave White with a very nice position. In fact simply playing e4 right away and leaving the discovered attack for another time may be even better. In any case White would have built a big center ruled out or discouraged …f5 and proven …Ng4 to be a waste of time."

Now White is going to have an awfully hard time getting any sort of attack going since the Bishop can't get to h7 and the Queen can't get to h5. Meanwhile Black's pieces are beginning to point menacingly towards the Black King. 

This is a perfect example of how if you do not punish your opponents' mistakes right away they may end up doing a pretty convincing impression of good moves! White could have had a clear advantage last turn but now the initiative is shifting over to Black."

With the King still in the center and 4 pieces undeveloped however a pawn storm is a bit unrealistic. …Be7 followed by castling was indicated. In the case of h3 Black is happy to play …Nf6 and add more control to e4.

Instead White is trading off one of only three pieces that are doing anything in exchange for a Knight who had no hope of otherwise participating in the game for a long time to come. (The action is all in the center and on the Kingside and the Nc6 has no easy way to get there — all it does is block the Bb7.)

860,39,12,1h3,b'r3kb1r/pbpp2p1/1p2p2p/4Pp2/3P2nq/2PBP2P/PP2Q1P1/RNB2RK1 b kq -',Not great but what else could White play? g3 might have actually been safer — even though White's light squares look awful there is no obvious way to break through.
861,39,13,1h5,b'r3kb1r/pbpp2p1/1p2p3/4Pp1p/3P2nq/2PBP2P/PP2Q1P1/RNB2RK1 w kq -',! That's more like it! Now Black is playing with a purpose and the attack comes from seemingly out of nowhere. Note that while Black's DSB and QR do not play every one of White's Queenside pieces might as well be decoration.
862,39,14,d6,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p1pp3/4Pp1p/3P2nq/2PBP2P/PP1NQ1P1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Well-intentioned — Black is trying to open new lines of attack in the center while making square for the DSB. I think that either …Nh6 followed by …g5-g4 or else …0-0-0 with the same sacrifices as in the game would be more accurate however.
863,39,15,1e4,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p1pp3/4Pp1p/3PP1nq/2PB3P/PP1NQ1P1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',"?! The idea is great — an attack on the wing should be met by a counterattack in the center. White should further his/her development with the tempo-gaining Nf3 first though — right now the Queen is the only piece that is at all set up to attack in the center.

Note that White correctly refrains from hxg4 since after …hxg4 there would be no defense to Black's attack down the h-file."
864,39,16,1dxe5,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p2p3/4pp1p/3PP1nq/2PB3P/PP1NQ1P1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Consistent breaking down White's center. Given that both players have neglected their own development and central play so blatantly during the opening Black is actually able to play this line-opening move with an uncastled King and get away with it — but please don't try this at home folks!
865,39,17,1Nf3,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p2p3/4pp1p/3PP1nq/2PB1N1P/PP2Q1P1/R1B2RK1 b kq -',At last! This move was just begging to be played.
866,39,18,1Qf6,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p2pq2/4pp1p/3PP1n1/2PB1N1P/PP2Q1P1/R1B2RK1 w kq -',A sensible retreat holding the center.
867,39,19,1hxg4,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p4q1/4ppBp/3P2P1/2PB1N2/PP2Q1P1/R4RK1 b kq -',"?? Nope this move is still bad. 
Instead Nxe5 Qxg5 18. Nxg4+ (White could go after the Rook with Ng6+ but that seems risky; of course Nf3+ fails to …Qe7) …Qe7 Ne5 keeps a slight edge for White."
868,39,20,1e4,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p4q1/5pBp/3Pp1P1/2PB1N2/PP2Q1P1/R4RK1 w kq -',! Even better than hxg4 since it reduces White's counterplay.
869,39,21,1Bc2,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p4q1/5pBp/3Pp1P1/2P2N2/PPB1Q1P1/R4RK1 b kq -',? Now is no time to get timid. Ne5! (e.g. …Qxg5 19. Bb5+ intending Rxf5) would have kept an initiative for White.
870,39,22,1Qb5+,b'r3kb1r/pbp3p1/1p4q1/1Q3pB1/3Pp1p1/2P2N2/PPB3P1/R4RK1 b kq -',? Not to the point. Ne5! was still the best.
871,39,23,gxf3,b'r4b1r/pb1k2p1/1pp3q1/4Qp2/3PpB2/2P2p2/PPB3P1/R4RK1 w - -',! Brave though Black had little choice. Of course Qc7+ is not as threatening as it may seem since White has to deal with the mate threat and has no time to grab the Bishop.
872,39,24,2Kf2,b'r4b1r/pb1k2p1/1pp3q1/4Qp2/3PpB2/2P2p2/PPB2KP1/R4R2 b - -',?? This doesn't actually deal with the mate threat however. Either g3 or Rf2 would have kept the game going. Then …Bd6 is practically forced and we'll exchange off into a very favorable endgame for Black.
873,39,25,2Qxg2+,b'r4b1r/pb1k2p1/1pp5/4Qp2/3PpB2/2P2p2/PPB2Kq1/R4R2 w - -',"Ke1/e3 leads to …Qe2 mate.

Although the opening had some glaring innacuracies the middlegame more than made up for it with some exciting back-and-forth play."
