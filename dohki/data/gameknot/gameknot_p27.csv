0,0,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq d3',I decide on a bold strike to the center.
1,0,1,dxc6,b'rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2Pp3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I hoped the black queen or knight would capture the pawn so I could follow with Bb5 to pin the piece against the king.
2,0,2,bxc6,b'rnb1kbnr/p1q2pp1/2pp3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',But black did not oblige with Qc6 but instead took pawn to pawn. I expected black to respond with Ne6 to move the knight to where it could project power into the center of the board.
3,0,3,Be2,b'rnb1kbnr/p1q2pp1/2pp3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Getting ready to castle.
4,0,4,Be7,b'rnb1k1nr/p1q1bpp1/2pp3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',Looks like black is getting ready to castle too.
5,0,5,1b4,b'r3k1nr/p1q1bpp1/1nppb2p/4p3/1P2P3/P1N1BN2/2P1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq b3',I know this leaves the knight on c3 vulnerable to a queen attack but I plan to move that knight to a4 when that square is safe.
6,0,6,1Na4,b'r3k1nr/4bpp1/pqppb2p/4p3/NP2P3/P4N2/2P1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Now it's safe to advance the knight to a4.
7,0,7,1Qc1,b'3rk1nr/1q2bpp1/p1ppb2p/4p3/NPP1P3/P4N2/4BPPP/R1Q2RK1 b k -',Move queen to safety in case black advances the d pawn.
8,0,8,1Bf6,b'3rk1nr/1q3pp1/p1ppbb1p/4p3/NPP1P3/P4N2/4BPPP/R1Q2RK1 w k -',I thought Bf6 was questionable. Maybe black planned to advance the d pawn and take out my e pawn which would allow the bishop to claim my rook at a1. I would have move the knight to f6 instead since that would accomplish two goals: attack the undefended e4 pawn and allow the king to castle.
9,0,9,1cxd6,b'3rk2r/1q2npp1/p1pPbb1p/4p3/NP2P3/P4N2/4BPPP/R1Q2RK1 b k -',I really want my knight on the c5 square so I just have to move my pawn out of way.
10,0,10,Qc8,b'2q1k2r/4npp1/p1prbb1p/2N1p3/1P2P3/P4N2/4BPPP/R1Q2RK1 w k -',Queen moves to temporary safety.

12,0,12,Ng6,b'1q2k2r/5pp1/2pr1bnp/4p3/1PB1P3/P1Q2N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w k -',Black must think I am after the e5 pawn. I considered that as a possible target of opportunity for this queen move but I had another target of opportunity in mind. I like dual purpose moves.
13,0,13,2Nb3,b'3r2k1/1q3pp1/2pr1bnp/4p3/1PB1P3/PN6/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Now with two rooks lined up I best move the knight out of the way. And get the knight to where I can put it on the front lines.
14,0,14,2Ba6,b'3r2k1/4qpp1/B1pr1b1p/2N1p3/1P2Pn2/P7/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I moved the bishop here so I could move the knight to b7 and fork the two rooks.
15,0,15,2Rd6d2,b'3r2k1/4qpp1/B1p2b1p/2N1p3/1P2Pn2/P7/2Qr1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',But black had other plans for those rooks.
16,0,16,3Bxe2,b'3r2k1/4qpp1/2p2b1p/2N1p3/1P2P3/PQ6/3rBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',Looks like my bishop won't be supporting my knight after all.
17,0,17,3a4,b'3r2k1/4qpp1/2p2b1p/2N1p3/PP2P3/5Q2/3r1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Time to march the pawns.
18,0,18,Rd4,b'1r2q1k1/5pp1/2p2b1p/P1N1p3/1P1rP3/5Q2/5PPP/RR4K1 w - -',Looks like black really wants to stop the b pawn.
19,0,19,3Qa3,b'1r2q1k1/5pp1/2p2b1p/P1N1p3/1P1rP3/Q7/5PPP/RR4K1 b - -',Better bring in reinforcements.
20,0,20,3a6,b'1r2q1k1/4bpp1/P1p4p/2N1p3/1P1rP3/Q7/5PPP/RR4K1 b - -',I considered moving the f pawn up to support the e pawn. If Bxc5 followed by bxc5 then the rook could take the e pawn for free. I decided that another pawn push would do more to make black worry. Chess is a psychological game after all.
21,0,21,Rxb1+,b'4q1k1/5pp1/P1p4p/2P1p3/3rP3/Q7/5PPP/Rr4K1 w - -',I really expected black to take that free pawn. I guess taking out a rook was more tempting.
22,0,22,3f3,b'3rq1k1/5pp1/P1p4p/2P1p3/4P3/Q4P2/6PP/1R4K1 b - -',Now I support the e pawn.
23,0,23,4h3,b'3rq3/5ppk/P1p4p/2P1p3/4P3/Q4P1P/6P1/1R4K1 b - -',Give my king an escape square just in case.
24,0,24,4Rb6,b'4q3/r4ppk/PRp4p/2P1p3/Q3P3/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',Move rook so it and my queen can threaten the c pawn and protect the a pawn. I like dual purpose moves.
25,0,25,4a7,b'4q3/P1r2ppk/1Rp4p/2P1p3/Q3P3/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',Give black something to worry about.
26,0,26,4Ra6,b'q7/P1r2ppk/R1p4p/2P1p3/Q3P3/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',Protect the a pawn.
27,0,27,4Kh2,b'q7/Pr4pk/R1p2p1p/Q1P1p3/4P3/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',Move king to safety.
28,0,28,4Rb5,b'q7/P5pk/R1p2p1p/QrP1p3/4P3/5P1P/6PK/8 w - -',Black threatens my queen.
29,0,29,4Qa3,b'q7/P5pk/R1p2p1p/1rP1p3/4P3/Q4P1P/6PK/8 b - -',I considered Qc7 and also Qa3. Both would protect the a pawn. One of them would also protect the c pawn. Another dual purpose move.
30,0,30,4Rb6,b'q7/P5pk/1Rp2p2/1rP1p2p/4P3/Q4P1P/6PK/8 b - -',I like this little symmetry with the rooks and pawns. But the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry. On one hand if Rxb6 then cxb6 and now I have a pawn supporting the a pawn. I can them move my queen to a6 to both threaten b7 and Qxc6. Putting both pawns on the 7th row would guarantee one of them would become queen. On the other hand if I take black's rook with Rxb5 I could then pick off black's pawn on b5. It would mean giving up the pawn on a7 but I would still have the c pawn to guide to the 8th rank. Nice how the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry.
31,0,31,4g6,b'q7/P6k/1Rp2pp1/1rP1p2p/4P3/Q4P1P/6PK/8 w - -',This is interesting! Black doesn't take the bait to exchange rooks but instead makes his king vulnerable.
32,0,32,4Qa6,b'q7/P6k/QRp2pp1/1rP1p2p/4P3/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',I follow with Qa6! This allows me both threaten the pawn on c6 and threaten to trap the queen with Rb8 and threaten check with Qb7! Three options for a single move!
33,0,33,4Rxc5,b'q7/P6k/QRp2pp1/2r1p2p/4P3/5P1P/6PK/8 w - -',Black took the pawn which allows me to choose the tactic that ...
34,0,34,5Rb8,b'qR6/P6k/Q1p2pp1/2r1p2p/4P3/5P1P/6PK/8 b - -',... traps the black queen! The queen has 3 moves and they all lead to capture! Black resigned at this point.
35,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Dopo tre tentativi falliti con i pezzi bianchi Sergey Karjakin decide che ne ha abbastanza con 1.e4. Dopo tutto Carlsen era quello che ha deciso il tipo di apertura nella prima metà della partita così lo sfidante deve aver sentito una certa pressione per cambiare le cose. Nei loro precedenti incontri Karjakin ha giocato 1.d4 solo tre volte contro il campione del mondo.
36,1,1,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',"Già Carlsen si differenzia dalla sua scelta di apertura giocata a Bilbao. Sicuramente Karjakin non può ripetere la combinazione giocata allora perché Magnus sarebbe in grado di rigiocare la stessa partita senza molto stress.

37,1,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',.
38,1,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Entriamo nel slava generalmente considerata una solida apertura per il nero. Il Bianco spesso sviluppa con più facilità e spera di creare punti deboli sul lato di Donna ma il Nero è in grado di espandersi con a6 dxc4 b5 c5 (come si vede nel gioco). Carlsen tentò di giocare la slava alle in Olimpiadi di quest'anno ma prima di allora non aveva giocato l'apertura dal 2014. A questo punto è facile pensare che il team del russo avesse preparato questa apertura per prendere in contropiede Magnus. Cosa però che non si è realizzata.
39,1,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Questa mossa permette alcune varianti della slava limitando altre. (4. Nf3 è anche popolare ma questo cambia la direzione del gioco portandolo in linee e posizioni complicate Questa variante è stata giocata più di 5000 volte: 4 ... dxc4 5. a4 Bf5 6. e3 e6 7. Bxc4 Bb4 . In questo caso il bianco ha fatto una concessione legittima sul lato di Donna consegnando la casa b4 ma Bianco mira a muovere alla fine e3-e4 e colpire nel centro. C'è una certa tensione in questa linea con una forte concentrazione di pezzi minori che non è presente nel proseguimento del gioco. Forse Karjakin rammarica della direzione che ha preso il gioco.)

I think I'd be tempted to play d6 here and develop the bishop to d7 to help prepare b6-b5 or to f5 maybe followed by Nf6-d7-e5-d3 where it will be supported by the pawn which is backed up by the Bf5. Black seems to be just developing without a concrete plan..
123,2,22,1Nc3,b'r2qr1k1/pb1pbppp/1p3n2/2pP4/2P1p3/1PN1P3/PB2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',White starts to build up on the e4 pawn.

127,2,26,1g4,b'r2qrbk1/1b1p1ppp/pp3n2/2pP4/2P1p1P1/1PN1P3/PBQ1BP1P/R3K2R b KQ g3',Rather wildly hitting out on the king-side. I can't help thinking it shouldn't work but it does.

However if say d7-d6 creating d7 as a flight square for the knight or Kh8 creating g8 as a flight square after 15. g4-g5 and the knight runs white captures on e4 with the knight which also protects his pawn on g5. So I am not sure black had anything better. 
129,2,28,1h4,b'r2qrbk1/1b1p1pp1/pp3n1p/2pP4/2P1p1PP/1PN1P3/PBQ1BP2/R3K2R b KQ h3',Renewing the threat of driving the knight away followed by taking on e4.

If white takes on h6 maybe black instead of recapturing immediately with the pawn can play g7-g6 and recapture on h6 with the bishop. Presumably white can continue the attack then with h4-h5 and maybe black can again try to keep the files closed with g6-g5 and maybe if black wants to go in for all this it is best to retreat the knight to h7 so that it ends up supporting the pawn on g5. It is still advantage white - it is he that is doing the attacking but black is still in the game. Where opening the h file gives more winning possibilities to white.
135,2,34,1hxg5,b'r3rbk1/1b2qpp1/pp1p1n2/2pP2P1/2P1p3/1PN1P3/PBQ1BP2/2KR3R b - -',So white takes back.

King is forced to go to h8. Then white can play Bg8+!! King takes the bishop on g8 and then white plays Qh7 mate. However if black doesn't take the knight white threatens to play 20. Nf6+ and if black captures with pawn or queen white has Qc2-h7 mate so black would have to capture with his knight covering h7. But then white simply recaptures with the pawn threatening Qc2-h7 mate again and also threatening the black queen. To stop all this black closes the b1-h7 diagonal. But it is a case of out of the frying pan into the fire! What does white play now?
139,2,38,2Rh8#,b'r3rbkR/1b1nqp2/pp1p2p1/2pP2P1/2P1N3/1P2P3/PBQ1BP2/2KR4 b - -',"Did you spot that? Notice how vulnerable the black king has become with the open h file. By closing one diagonal to white's pieces black accidentally opens up another to deadly effect! But black's position is hopeless after 19. Nxe4 for instance if 19....f5 which blocks the b1-h7 diagonal and gives the black king an escape square on f7 but after gxf6 e.p. Qxe4 21. Bd3 black hasn't got any decent square for his queen. Moving to the g file merely allows Rd1-g1 moving the rook to a better square into the attack. And after Qf3 22. Bh7+ moving the king to f7 allows Qg6 mate and Kh8 allows Be4 discovering check and winning the black queen.

Undoubtedly Carlsen and his team payed special attention in white pieces preparation and have developed new and unexplored positions where Karjakin should not have deep theoretical knowledge and will feel uncomfortably.

From here white nas NO forced win as far as I can see. The WQ is trapped after Ra8 so white has to keep black controlled with Qa4+ Kc8 (forced or loses the R. Then Nb5 allows lines similar to the following. Nf4 is another way to win after Nf4 ...Ra8 Nd5+ ...NxN NxN+ ...Kc8 (forced) Nb6+ and wins Ra8. But let's say white plays...

264,7,29,1Ng5,b'r1b4r/pp1nkp2/2p1p2p/q4pNQ/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Did you find it? My attack on f7 wins back a pawn. Notice the pin on the h file - this game is going to be full of pins!
265,7,30,1Rf8,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkp2/2p1p2p/q4pNQ/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So he protects f7.
266,7,31,1Qxh6,b'r1b2r2/pp1nkp2/2p1p2Q/q4pN1/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I gain my pawn back.
267,7,32,1Nf6,b'r1b2r2/pp2kp2/2p1pn1Q/q4pN1/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He develops his knight. Guess my next move?
268,7,33,1Qh4,b'r1b2r2/pp2kp2/2p1pn2/q4pN1/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Did you find it? I thought this was a powerful half-pin on his knight. The threat is 19. Nh7 winning the knight. I though he had to move his king to e8 d7 or d6 but he finds another move.
269,7,34,1Rg8,b'r1b3r1/pp2kp2/2p1pn2/q4pN1/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I don't rate this idea.
270,7,35,1Nh7,b'r1b3r1/pp2kp1N/2p1pn2/q4p2/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So i continue.
271,7,36,1Rg6,b'r1b5/pp2kp1N/2p1pnr1/q4p2/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He protects.
272,7,37,2Nxf6,b'r1b5/pp2kp2/2p1pNr1/q4p2/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',I take - it may be better to build up the tension rather than play this immediately but it does lure his rook onto a dreadful square.
273,7,38,2Rxf6,b'r1b5/pp2kp2/2p1pr2/q4p2/P1BP3Q/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',He takes back. OK try and guess what I played again?
274,7,39,2Qg5,b'r1b5/pp2kp2/2p1pr2/q4pQ1/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 b - -',The idea is to play e4 threatening e5 and like before there is a pin along the fifth rank so that if he meets e3-e4 with f5xe4 then his queen goes.
275,7,40,2Qc7,b'r1b5/ppq1kp2/2p1pr2/5pQ1/P1BP4/4P3/5PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So the queen drops back to break the pin. I think he would have been better advised to play Qd8 allowing his king to move and then his rook to move. My pin on his rook is too powerful for him.
276,7,41,2f3,b'r1b5/ppq1kp2/2p1pr2/5pQ1/P1BP4/4PP2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',And I again threaten e3-e4.
277,7,42,2e5,b'r1b5/ppq1kp2/2p2r2/4ppQ1/P1BP4/4PP2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',This looks to me to be a dreadful move - I was still thinking Qd8 must be his best move admitting that he last move was wrong. Now the centre is opening up and his king is going to be vulnerable. 
278,7,43,2e4,b'r1b5/ppq1kp2/2p2r2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/6PP/R4RK1 b - -',I want the centre opened as much as possible.
279,7,44,2Qb6,b'r1b5/pp2kp2/1qp2r2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/6PP/R4RK1 w - -',Now he comes up with his own pin.
280,7,45,2Rad1,b'r1b5/pp2kp2/1qp2r2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/6PP/3R1RK1 b - -',So I protect my d pawn.
281,7,46,2Be6,b'r7/pp2kp2/1qp1br2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/6PP/3R1RK1 w - -',He finally develops his bishop. OK what did I do next?
282,7,47,2Kh1,b'r7/pp2kp2/1qp1br2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/6PP/3R1R1K b - -',Did you find it? Breaking the pin threatens d4xe5
283,7,48,2Qb2,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p1br2/4ppQ1/P1BPP3/5P2/1q4PP/3R1R1K w - -',So he prepares to meet d4xe5 with Qxe5. So find the best move now?
284,7,49,2f4,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p1br2/4ppQ1/P1BPPP2/8/1q4PP/3R1R1K b - -',Did you find it? I am determined to get a pawn to e5 and win his rook.
285,7,50,2Bxc4,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p2r2/4ppQ1/P1bPPP2/8/1q4PP/3R1R1K w - -',So he takes the bishop. So which pawn is it best to use to take on e5? Or should I move my attacked rook?
286,7,51,2dxe5,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p2r2/4PpQ1/P1b1PP2/8/1q4PP/3R1R1K b - -',Would you have played this?
287,7,52,2Bxf1,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p2r2/4PpQ1/P3PP2/8/1q4PP/3R1b1K w - -',Again I have a choice. Which is best? Recapture the bishop or take the rook and if so with pawn or queen?
288,7,53,2exf6+,b'r7/pp2kp2/2p2P2/5pQ1/P3PP2/8/1q4PP/3R1b1K b - -',"is this what you would play dear reader? This is best. If I take with the queen after his king goes to e8 or f8 I can't pick up his rook on a8 with 29 Qh8+ followed by 30. Qh8xRa8 as he can reply Qb2xg2 mate! Now however because I took with the d pawn on move 27 the d file is open and if his king drops back to e8 or f8 I can mate him with my queen. Yes he can avoid this with Qxf6 but then 29. Rd7+ wins his queen (if 29....Ke6 then 30. Rd6+). Sure he has rook and bishop against my queen but in this open board my queen is much better. I have a simple winning plan of h2-h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=rook winning his rook which is hard to stop. In this position then my opponent obviously able to see all these variations resigned.

358,10,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So Bill plays this which I'm most used to.  No surprise there as now I answer with the usual.  After which I wasn't sure how he'd respond.  But when white choses the open variation I stick with it.
359,10,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The problem is just like with my second game with Ken on how intense openings can be I'm absolutely not aware of it.  That's because I saw that once and was overwhelmed at it's first time.  With that being said I thought that I was already used to it.  But boy was I wrong.  This is a small example of getting overly confident.  The problem is however that I do so much of it that I forgot lesson 1 with Ken.  As this is where I fail to analyze multiple (even one variation).  So right there that's worse then average because with Ken I was only analyzing one variation and he said that I needed multiple.  Therefore I begin to stop thinking about the game which is not a good way to go about.  On top of that at the beginning things had quieted down at work.  However I do other things that take away from being able to play chess like working out.  Before that it starts to pick up at work again at this point.  Although it's not a big problem yet that will change.
360,10,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Meanwhile I develop with the other idea being to attack his pawn.
361,10,3,Ng5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p3N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This does more then protect his pawn.  And that's where it really starts to go wrong and I mess up.  I figured that he made an inaccuracy by playing this since it moves the same piece twice.  Even after the rated game with bhidragon my attitude was still trying to sastisfy some of the basics of opening play which is not how it's supposed when the board reveals another story.  So in other words I once again failed to figure out what the board was telling me.  In fact unlike that other game I didn't even try which had worse affects.  I just figured that he was making a threat by trying to place pressure on the f file.  That would've existed but that threat is a mere nuicanse.  Instead the real threat is much worse.  Therefore without even looking at one variation I figured that I got rid of the problem by driving off that burden with 4...h6?? which is the losing blunder.  The other reason behind it was in an attempt to get a semi open file with the Rook.  Now things have suddenly gotten busy both in and outside of work.  So instead of getting nervous I became overly confident by figuring that I just knew what to do rather then looking at the threats.  What that boils down is playing a move because it looks good rather then knowing if it's good or not and why which is also something that I've emphasized to my students.  The reason though that I deem it worthy of an annotation is because of something similar that Jack emphasized involving the same threat but with a different game.  That's because my weakest pawn and thus a major piece were at risk since the real threat obviously involves a N fork.  He said that when coped with that you must exchange by bringing the B out on that diagnol.  With that being said 9...Be6 was forced.  The idea as he showed involves exchanging the B and even though black gets doubled pawns he is allright because that keeps everything defended with the extra defender.  And that is a well known fact.  Unlike my game with Ken or bhidragon none of that came into consideration.  In fact I did not even think twice about it before playing my next move somewhat similar to what I mentioned in that game where Korchnoi defeated Fischer.  
362,10,4,Bg4,b'rn1qkb1r/pp2pNp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P1b1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',?? After seeing what I had done I figured that this move gives me counterplay.  This is where I begin looking into variations but as you'd now expect I only looked at one variation.  The real truth is as Ken noted multiple variations are needed.  With that being said my attitude is that I'll let Bill have my Queen.  For if he takes it I'll recapture his Queen on d1 and if he then takes my Bishop I'll take his N.  If however he protects the N I'll protect my B and from there it's even.  But I did not however give his next move any consideration whatsoever.  For after he attacks it with 6.f3 I'm forced to protect my Queen.  In exchange on top of the Rook I'm going to lose another piece without any compensation.  When you count the pawn this is the equivalent to a Queen without anything in return.  But that's the least of my problem.  On top of that it's now stressful at work so I figured that by having this though process rather then the nervousness I was out of the woods.  As I just learned that's not so since you can do so much that you forget just about everything you were taught.  And you can also forget the important lessons you've taught to your students which is what happened here.  Therefore had I given this anymore consideration I would've played 5...Qa5 to prevent what happens next.
363,10,5,Qb4,b'rn2kb1N/pp2p1p1/3p1n1p/2p5/1qB1P1b1/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQq -',Figuring that I've prevented a loss of another piece I played this.  As before aside from one variation nothing else came into consideration.  Sure I don't enjoy liquidation in this position.  But my thought was if he takes on g4 I'll take back and in return won't lose anything.  In fact I'll attempt counter play since I am better developed and thus would get my Nb8 and then advance my e or g pawns to get my Bf8 into play.  The reason behind this thought process is that someone won a game under that condition after having had lost her Rook.  Although I didn't think she played well and was lucky to get counterplay a commentator disagreed with me.  In it he said that despite losing a R she was always in better shape due to being better developed.  So I figured that a swindle was possible under those conditions but I was wrong here as his next move took me off guard since.  As you'd expect it did not come into consideration.  That's because he checks with the same piece that I was threatening to take so when I get out he gets another piece with only a pawn in return.  After which it is a resignable position and I'm almost ready to resign.  But without anything else to lose I'll try one more thing.
364,10,6,Qh7,b'rn3b1N/pp1kpBpq/3p1n1p/2p5/6P1/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',That is this move.  I figured that it was trapped.  Here comes to the first time in the entire game where I start to think about more then one variation but it's too little too late since I forgot about his Bf7.  With Ghost Vision I thought that it was on h5.  Were it not on f7 this would've worked.  So with that being said I believed that it only had one square which is the move that he plays next.  After which I'd be ready to grab it. 
365,10,7,1Ng6,b'rn3b2/pp1kpBpq/3p1nNp/2p5/6P1/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1K2R b KQ -',After figuring out that I was wrong by rechecking where it was I resigned.  What I'm doing differently which will last until after Halloween is cut the game load way down.  Usually I can handle up to 6 games but I'm going to keep it down to only 1 game at a time until after Halloween as on top of work I'm also gonna be at the gym and getting together with friends.  After November I'll wait and see.  Eventually when it really quiet's down and I've got more availability and flexibility it'll go back to normal.  In the future that's how it's also going to be.  Sometimes busyness like with this game happens on the spot where you have no advanced warning.  But once it starts the game load will go down because it has the same affect as when I was playing those 20-30 simultaneous games with an average time control of much too quickly.  The similarity is that it takes away too much concentration and with it the ability to absorb the information and digest the information.  And at some point when this tourney is completed I will be showing Jack Stockel this game.  That's because he showed his club members what to do when coped with that threat that I saw after 4.Ng5 was played.
366,11,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Just like with me as well as your average chess player this was also Fischer's favorite opening.  In fact this is what he called ""Best by Test"" and it also goes by something that elyhim mentioned which I've noted in several of my annotations ""stick with what you know""."
367,11,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',But just like with me Fischer also in my opinion isn't use to seeing this played as black.  I believe it's the Pirc Defense but whatever it is it's unusual which is also why I deem analysis necessary as much more common is the Scandinavian Defense in which 1...d5  In fact the master mater played this against me and I lost for the same reason that I lost the game with elyhim as well as games that Ken has seen being that I wasn't used to it.  That shows as Ken also mentioned how intense openings can be.
368,11,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Yet not only would I have played but nothing else would've come into consideration because of what theory states.  That is when black only advances a pawn one move in their first move 2.d4 is the way to go.  
369,11,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Like wise I also wouldn't have considered any other move as black since this develops.
370,11,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Fischer is thinking along the same lines since he also develops.  Although unlike before this is the only other move that would've come into consideration I would've played 3.Nf3 to mobilize the K side with the idea of castling short.  But as per what happened with my game against Loyd on Friday it can wait as that was the second time that I thought about Joann's thread on ""When and Where it's safe to castle"".  In fact Fischer doesn't castle until much later on (by this I mean 5 more moves as opposed to in the near future which would be in at most 3 moves.)"
371,11,5,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',But Korchnoi however thinks differently with this fianchetto.  Personally I would've played 3...e6 with the idea of opening up the center.  But this is the first move where I would've thought about several moves that develop since we have the Bc8 as well as the Nb8.  With that being said this also would've come into consideration.
372,11,6,f4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',But I wouldn't have even considered this move since that's the weakest pawn on the board.  As a rule of thumb I leave it alone in the opening because if it gets captured you wind up in trouble.  Most people do not agree but I know otherwise because of what TA emphasized in his club with the blitz Q sacs.  In fact that's how I remembered about what to do in the Domiano Defense especially when black gets greedy and takes the N as the f pawn is removed which is how white wins the game.  And after mentioning it Joe implied that my assessment is spot on.  In it he said that I see the pattern which is also what he was trying to show by sacking the Queen for a pawn.  That's because it is the f pawn which is the weakest one on the board.  Once it's gone you must be careful as you're left with that same weakness.
373,11,7,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',After having had finachettoed nothing else would've come into consideration since Victor has a nice long diagonal for his Bishop which is something that I also care.  But this also enables black to castle which is also why I would've played this as he will castle on his next move.
374,11,8,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Meanwhile Bob has his mind on mobilizing the K side.  But Victor is one step ahead because as noted he is about to castle.
375,11,9,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',Which enables Bob to mobilize his K side even more with this move.  Although this would've come into consideration I on the other hand would've played 6.Bd3 to add a defender to the e4 pawn.
376,11,10,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',"At first I was wondering why Victor played this and didn't see the point.  That's because I would've continued developing by bringing the Bc8 into play.  But this is a solid move.  The idea is to allow ...Nc6 since Victor going to follow the guideline of not advancing the N until the c pawn has advanced.  On the other hand I would've ignored that guideline since white did not play 1.e4 which means that it would've been inaccurate.  What that shows is something that I noted in TA's game.  While you don't always need to follow since seeing the big picture (the entire story that the board is indicating is more important); it's important to ""Know your principles"".  That means understand why a particular one is there and other times and for certain ones it matters.  That is the case here.  With that being said Bob takes."
377,11,11,Qa5,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/q1P5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',Instead of taking back Victor plays this.  But for me aside from 7...dxc5 nothing else would've come into consideration.  On the other hand this move makes sense.  I don't see how but understand that whites Nc3 is more then just a nuicanse where as I would've just seen it as annoying and thus an obstacle as it doesn't appear tp threaten anything.  But looks can be deceiving and there's just got to be something that makes white's Nc3 a monster.
378,11,12,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/q1P5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I like castling and can understand why Fischer did this.  But despite what I was once told I don't always follow the rule of basing things on what the position demands.  Perhaps that's where I go wrong as we saw in my second game with dynamic_dv.  With that being 8.Bd2 is the only that would've come into consideration.  With that being said I wouldn't have hesitated or even thought twice about playing that move.  As you would expect that's because Jack Stockel mentioned that the best way to break a pin like this is with the Bishop and despite coaching this is still the only thing that I go by despite the pin happening on the Nc3 as opposed to the Nf3 (which is when it generally applies).  But no matter how you look at it Victor is going to win the pawn back with his next move.
379,11,13,Kh1,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2q5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',Although 9.Rf2 was also an option I also would've played this move.  As interposing with the Rook leaves it pinned.  But even if it weren't so the primary reason behind playing this is because Jack also mentioned that the monarch is the safest in the corner after castling.  
380,11,14,Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2q5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Meanwhile Victor continues with his development.
381,11,15,1Nd2,b'r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2q5/4PP2/2N5/PPPNB1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',At first I didn't understand why Bob played this.  I don't see a better outpost but there's something about 11.Nb3 that does.  My guess is just the gain of tempo because the Queen is attacked.
382,11,16,1a5,b'r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/2np1np1/p1q5/4PP2/2N5/PPPNB1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - a6',"This is just like with one of my past games against easy19 in what he called ""Walking the Plank"" since we're talking about the same pawn.  But the significance is that Victor gets a semi open file as it is directly in front of the Rook which plays an important role."
383,11,17,1a4,b'r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1qnp1np1/p7/P3PP2/1NN5/1PP1B1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - a3',And with it Bob uses that time to stop black's open file.  For if he didn't Victor might threatened to get a passed pawn even sooner.
384,11,18,1Nb4,b'r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p1np1/p7/Pn2PP2/1NN5/1PP1B1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',And Victor goes on a rampage with his N.  Although we don't see it now this does pose as a threat as I learned with TA's Knight visualization as it becomes evident when this moves back and forth.  That's why a N is generally worth more then a B.  That's not all the time but more often then not.  As GM Susan Polgar also illustrated when she answered my question on when to exchange making the rule of thumb to trade off the opponents N for your B and when I have questions I follow this rule without hesitation.  
385,11,19,1g4,b'r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p1np1/p7/Pn2PPP1/1NN5/1PP1B2P/R1BQ1R1K b - g3',Bob's idea of a good time is exchanging pieces.  But Victor has the same idea since in a different form a variation involving exchanges (what I thereby call an exchange variation is about to occur.)
386,11,20,1Nb5,b'r4rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p2p1/pN6/P3PPQ1/1N6/1Pn4P/R1B2R1K b - -',As white I would've played 16.Ra2 to protect the Rook.  Aside from that nothing else would've come into consideration but I guess Bob feels that black's Nc2 is more dangerous.  Unlike with a normal game I do see the point since GM's see things that we don't.  
387,11,21,Qc6,b'r4rk1/1p2ppbp/2qp2p1/pN6/P3PPQ1/8/1P5P/N1B2R1K w - -',Victor is obviously going for Bob's e4 pawn in which he protects with 18.f5  But as white I wouldn't have looked at anything else aside from 18.Re1 with an interesting variation which I don't think would've worked out.  But that would not have changed my thought process in any shape or form because in a normal game if black weren't careful white would get a passed pawn much later on.  And with a passer a Rook behind it is very powerful and useful.  With that being said however white protects in a very interesting way as he is threatening to exchange pawns.  As black I would've excepted for after 18.f5 I would go ahead and play 18...gxf5  But I like black's 18th move even better since white's Rf1 is attacked.  What that shows is that I need to give things a little more thought.  I should've learned this with Ken when giving these kinds of answers combined with him pointing out why they don't work.  But seeing it from a GM game is going to help me learn even more.  For protecting it means that he'll lose another pawn which is why 18...gxf5?! isn't necessary.  What it boils down is trying to be more mobile in my assessment because there is a lot when the Queen goes to c4.   
388,11,22,2Nc7,b'r4rk1/1pN1ppbp/3p2p1/p4P2/q3P3/5Q2/1P5P/N1B2R1K b - -',Knowing the way that I think this does not seem to bother Bob since he is threatening the Rook.  But what comes is very interesting.  Instead of defending it Victor's next move is 20...Qxa1.  I however would've defended the Ra8 since losing a Rook appears to always be worst as it is a major piece.  But this is where what Jack says is true.  In this case the N is worth more as it's more powerful mobile and dangerous.  Therefore I think that Victor made the right choice by taking on a1.
389,11,23,2Nd5,b'r4rk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2N1P2/4P3/5Q2/1P5P/q1B2R1K b - -',On the other hand my next move would have been 21.Nxa8 to get back a Rook for Knight.  Beside's that nothing else would've come into consideration as I would feel that I've gotten counterplay by doing that.  But Bob plays this.  My inference is similar to before being that the N is more important in this position.  And with this move the N visualization is even more so at the top of my mind.
390,11,24,2Rae8,b'4rrk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2N1P2/4P3/5Q2/1P5P/q1B2R1K w - -',I also would've played 21...Rfe8 as this also centralizes the Rook whilst preventing what follows later on. 
391,11,25,2Bg5,b'4rrk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2N1PB1/4P3/5Q2/1P5P/q4R1K b - -',With Bob's Nd5 Victor's Rf8 is under pressure.  But as we'll see later on he views that Rook as not important.  It'll be interesting to see why.  With that being said when Victor takes on b2 that pressure becomes inevitable.  For when Bob takes back he will exchange the Rook for Bishop.  I guess that black kept that in mind which would mean in my opinion that white's Bg5 is worth more then black's Rf8.  I see why as it is also more mobile and that's based on Ken's advice to assess things from a more mobile perspective then what I've doing lately.
392,11,26,Be5,b'4rrk1/1p2Bp1p/3p2p1/p2NbP2/4P3/5Q2/1q5P/5R1K w - -',To delay the capture Victor threatens mate in such a way that Bob's next move is forced.  This is significant because of what follows later on leaving white with virtually no counterplay as we'll see later on.  
393,11,27,2Rf1,b'4rrk1/1p2Bp1p/3p2p1/p2NbP2/4P3/5Q2/7P/2q2R1K b - -',I however would've gotten out of check with 25.Kg2.  From there not only wouldn't I feel any more pressure but despite being behind just like in my recent game with Ken I'd feel even more comfortable.  That's because the white's Rook on f2 appeared to give more protection to the K.  I say that because of what happens next in which mate is threatened again.  In exchange Bob's 26th move is also forced. In which black will get the needed Bishop for the less mobile Rook.  And that in my opinion is what will leave white with a hopeless position as he needs the Be7 to prevent what's coming.  
394,11,28,2Ne7+,b'5rk1/1p2Np1p/3p3q/p3bp2/4P3/5Q1P/8/5R1K b - -',Bob does what he can to hold back the attack.  For after getting out of check Bob will get back the pawn and attack the Queen.  But as we're going to see it's not enough.
395,11,29,3Rg1,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3pq3/p3bN2/4P3/5Q1P/8/6RK b - -',I'm not sure why Bob played.  Perhaps he was thinking in terms of a long variation that would result in mate.  Going by the thought process maybe he was thinking along the lines of driving Victors Be5 back.  That would result in something like Rg5 and then moving the Nf5 for a discovered.  And then perhaps bringing the Rook back and playing Qg4 in which white threatens Qg7#  In that case my inference is that he's going for a swindle.
396,11,30,3a4,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3pq3/4bN2/p3P3/5Q1P/8/6RK w - -',But this is where it becomes evident to me that Bob has no chance of counterplay.  As now Victor has just pushed his passed.  And without his DSB there is no way to stop.  That's why in this position it was worth more then black's Rook.  So it turns out that black didn't need it and therefore gave it up to get that Bishop; as now there is nothing that white can do about that passer.
397,11,31,3Rg4,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3pq3/4bN2/p3P1R1/5Q1P/8/7K b - -',I'm not sure why Bob played but my guess that he's trying to do something with the e pawn.  Perhaps his goal is to get a passed pawn so that black promotes he can do it as well and hope for a draw.
398,11,32,3Qb3,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3p4/4bN2/p3P1R1/1q3Q1P/8/7K w - -',But if that was the plan it won't work since Victor is now supporting the passed pawn with his Queen.  And yes this is an example of where getting that semi open file is important because that's what often leads to a passed pawn as theory indicates.  I say that because unless I misunderstood (which often happens) this is what Joe was alluding to by a semi open file.  For in that game that's what allowed the passer as well as it involved the very same pawn that opened the file.
399,11,33,3Qf1,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3p4/4bN2/p3P1R1/1q5P/8/5Q1K b - -',Doing what he can Bob tries to stop it for white thinks that if Victor breaks through and promotes he'll take with the Queen.  And to be honest that's how I've also been known to think in my games.  But black's next move is an example of where I'd be wrong.  
400,11,34,3a3,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3p4/4bN2/4P1R1/pq5P/8/5Q1K w - -',As now the pawn has even more support from Victor's Queen.
401,11,35,3Rg3,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3p4/4bN2/4P3/pq4RP/8/5Q1K b - -',As the court of last resort Bob for the last time tries to stop the promotion with this move.  This however is now Hope Chess.  As black has an added threat.  He's hoping that black doesn't see that and retreats.  Doing this would allow Rxa3 which would in return stop that pawn.
402,11,36,3Qxg3,b'5r1k/1p3p1p/3p4/4bN2/4P3/p5qP/8/5Q1K w - -',But Victor sees it by taking the Rook.  And Bob resigns.  As white however it would've been the reverse as I would've resigned earlier.  But this move would've stopped me from doing so as I would not have hesitated to take back with Nxg3 which appears to win the Queen back for a N.  As I used to think now what.  In other words what can black do.  But I know the answer with a similar study from Jack Stockel.  Without the N there black would later play ...a2 which would promote.  And there's nothing that white can do about.  And after promoting white doesn't get anything else in return so it is a hopeless position.  Therefore even from (at the time) the world champion I find resignation to be appropriate.  
403,12,0,g3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I've been experimenting with the King's Indian Attack as an opening for White.  I wasn't very happy with the position I got in this game.

405,12,2,Qxc5,b'r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2qp4/5B2/1PP3P1/P3QPBP/RN3RK1 w kq -',Now I'm down a pawn.

410,12,7,Qb6,b'r3k2r/1p2bppp/pq3n2/3pB3/8/1PP3P1/P3QPBP/R2R2K1 w kq -',The pawn has been regained.  And now my slight lead in development is making his King uncomfortable.
411,12,8,Rb8,b'1r2k2r/1p2bppp/p4q2/3B4/8/1PP3P1/P3QP1P/R2R2K1 w k -',Now White is a pawn up.
412,12,9,2Rde1,b'1r2k2r/1p2bppp/p4q2/3B4/8/1PP3P1/P3QP1P/R3R1K1 b k -',This prevents castling immediately as White can play Qxe7 winning a piece.
413,12,10,2Qe5,b'1r3k1r/1p2bppp/p4q2/3BQ3/8/1PP3P1/P4P1P/R3R1K1 b - -',With Black now unable to castle I exchange down to an endgame.
414,12,11,2bxc4,b'1r1r4/5pkp/p4bp1/3B4/2P5/4R1PP/P3RPK1/8 b - -',Although I could be wrong about this I thought this was the right recapture because it gives me the passed pawn.  I thought that would create more pressure for my opponent than playing Bxc4.
415,12,12,3Ra3,b'3r1k2/5p1p/1r3bp1/p2B4/2P5/R5PP/P3RPK1/8 b - -',This was not much of a plan on my part.  f7 is a target but I haven't figured out how to get to it yet.
416,12,13,3Rb7,b'3r1k2/1R3p1p/r4bp1/p2B4/2P5/6PP/P3RPK1/8 b - -',Now f7 will fall.
417,12,14,3cxd5,b'5k2/1R3p1p/r4bp1/p2P4/8/6PP/P3RPK1/8 b - -',Out of desperation my opponent gives up the exchange.  Now I have to figure out a plan to exert pressure with the two Rooks and the passed pawn.
418,12,15,4d6,b'3b1k2/3r1p2/2RP2p1/pR5p/8/6PP/P4PK1/8 b - -',The passed pawn on the sixth rank becomes a monster.  Black has to spend all of his time dealing with it.
419,12,16,4Re5,b'3b1k2/3r4/2RP2p1/p3Rp1p/8/6PP/P4PK1/8 b - -',This Rook seals the King away from helping in the fight against the passed pawn.
420,12,17,4f4,b'3b4/3r1k2/2RP2p1/p3Rp1p/5P2/6PP/P5K1/8 b - f3',My Rook is now supported.
421,12,18,Kf7,b'3b4/3r1k2/2RP2p1/p3Rp1p/5P1P/6P1/P5K1/8 w - -',My opponent's King can't join the fight--but mine can.
422,12,19,Rb7,b'3b4/1r3k2/2RP2p1/p2KRp1p/5P1P/6P1/P7/8 w - -',Black is desperate.  Now that my King seals off his King I could bring my second Rook into the fight.
423,12,20,5Rc8,b'2Rb4/1r3k2/3P2p1/p2KRp1p/5P1P/6P1/P7/8 b - -',Hitting the hanging piece which has no good squares.  Bf6 can be met with Rc7+.
424,12,21,5Kc6,b'2Rb4/5k2/2KP2p1/pr2Rp1p/5P1P/6P1/P7/8 b - -',Now I'm hitting two hanging pieces.  Rxe5 is met with fxe5.
425,12,22,5Kc5,b'2Rb4/5k2/1r1P2p1/p1K1Rp1p/5P1P/6P1/P7/8 b - -',Now Black has two pieces attacked and can only protect one.  Black resigned.
426,13,0,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',For one thing 3.Nf3 is the main follow up.  But I believe that Anderson plays this in an attempt to throw Kierseritzky off guard because in my opinion 3.Bc4 is not played by masters or GM's in response to the KG.  So it's something different.
427,13,1,Qh4+,b'rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',As with my most recent game against reversion 3.Nf3 is played to prevent this.  And I wouldn't know what to do here since castling isn't an option.  But white however has no problem giving up that right.  This appears to be reversed psychology as black appears to have the intitative.  My inference is that Anderson wanted Kieseritzky to get this early initative just like with Joe's sacs with the idea that if you don't know how to follow up or continue the game you'll wind up in trouble.  That happens by becoming overly confident which I strongly believe is the case for Kieseritzky.  So even though technically speaking black has the advantage I'm already starting to favor white's position since it appears to only a matter of time before black gets too comfortable. 
428,13,2,b5,b'rnb1kbnr/p1pp1ppp/8/1p6/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq b6',With that being said black attacks the Bishop.  Maybe he wants to give the pawn back before white can do harm.  Aside from that though I've got no idea so my inference is based solely on that.
429,13,3,Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1B6/4Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq -',With that being said Kieseritzky starts with his development.  And Anderson continues with his as well.  And in the process white's going to harass the Queen which will gain some important tempii.  And in professional games like this tempo is important which is another reason that I favor white's position believe it or not. 
430,13,4,Qh6,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n1q/1B6/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',This will enable white to open up the center as well as get a nice pawn chain.
431,13,5,Nh5,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',I don't know why Kieseritzky played this but as black the only move that would've come into consideration would be 7...Bb7 for a nice long diagnol which is why I wouldn't have hesitated to play it.
432,13,6,Nh4,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp1N/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq -',This move also took me by surprise because I would've continued developing with Nc3.  Aside from that the only other move that would've come into consideration is 8.b2 to financhetto the Q side.
433,13,7,Qg5,b'rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/8/1B4qn/4Pp1N/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',But unlike with what's noted above I also would've played this.  Not only is the N attacked but white's a file also appears to be under pressure.  As after Anderson retreats Kieseritzky reattacks.
434,13,8,1g4,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p5/1B3Nqn/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1K1R b kq g3',Instead of retreating however Anderson prepares to exchange by reattacking.
435,13,9,1Nf6,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/1B3Nq1/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1K1R w kq -',But Kieseritzky however refuses that.
436,13,10,1Rg1,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/1B3Nq1/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1KR1 b kq -',And instead of exchanging Anderson gives up a piece for a pawn.  Usually it would be considered a mistake but here it's safe to infer that it isn't.  Instead I think it's a similar idea to when I gave up my Rook against Perry.  Therefore 11...cxb5 is played as one would anticipate but I deem it to be a mistake that will at this point give Anderson a definite advantage.  It appears to be an example of becoming overly confident.
437,13,11,1h4,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/5n2/1p3Nq1/4PpPP/3P4/PPP5/RNBQ1KR1 b kq h3',As now Anderson gains more time.  In this case tempiik as opposed to tempo because of what comes next.
438,13,12,1Qf3,b'rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/5n2/1p3NqP/4PpP1/3P1Q2/PPP5/RNB2KR1 b kq -',That gain enables white to mobilize his Queen which is also very important.
439,13,13,1Ng8,b'rnb1kbnr/p2p1ppp/8/1p3NqP/4PpP1/3P1Q2/PPP5/RNB2KR1 w kq -',As black I would've played 14...Bc5 as opposed to undevelop the N.  But they see things that I don't and I guess that black was going to lose it or maybe lose the game quickly if he didn't.  Now it gets more interesting as Anderson knabs f7 which is important.  Although it didn't appear to be this was a passed pawn because there were no pawns in front of them.  Although white's pawns are next to black there was nothing to stop f4 except for white's next move which is why it was critical.  In the process he gains more time since black's Queen is attacked.
440,13,14,1Nc3,b'rnb1kbnr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1p3N1P/4PBP1/2NP1Q2/PPP5/R4KR1 b kq -',As now Anderson continues with his development.
441,13,15,1Bc5,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/5q2/1pb2N1P/4PBP1/2NP1Q2/PPP5/R4KR1 w kq -',Even more so then before we now get into uncharted territory somewhat similar to Janet's game against Charles in the second 4 Queens variation that I analyzed.  But this is even more dramatic then both sides making a promotion with both Queens on the same board.  It starts with Anderson's next move.  That's because he intentionally gives things away.
442,13,16,Qxb2,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/8/1pbN1N1P/4PBP1/3P1Q2/PqP5/R4KR1 w kq -',?? I don't know if really is a two Queiry move but in the English System ...Qxb2 is in most variations considered to be a losing blunder.  That's because Susan Polgar mentioned that taking this is a huge mistake that allows black to win.  Although the variations are different with what follows I'm applying the same concept regardless despite a different position because going into thought process I believe that Kieseritzky has just become overly confident.  And as he gets more and more comfortable black's headed for disaster big time which does unfold later in the game.
443,13,17,1Bd6,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/3B4/1pbN1N1P/4P1P1/3P1Q2/PqP5/R4KR1 b kq -',That becomes apparent with this move when black takes since I strongly believe that this is what Anderson anticipated.
444,13,18,1e5,b'rnb1k1nr/p2p1ppp/3B4/1p1NPN1P/6P1/3P1Q2/PqP5/R4Kb1 b kq -',The reason for that comment is because it's generally most common to take back in order to avoid the loss of more material.  But Anderson doesn't take back and instead allows black to take the other Rook with check.  When you don't blunder then it is a winning strategy.  And on a professional that is the case since Jack Stockel has showed me games where towards the end Bobby Fischer and I believe Caurana both sacked a lot of material in the end and won swiftly. 
445,13,19,Na6,b'r1b1k1nr/p2p1ppp/n2B4/1p1NPN1P/6P1/3P1Q2/P1P1K3/q5b1 w kq -',I'm not sure why black played but I assume that Kieseritzky is planning to set up a mating with that piece combined with his Bg1 and Qa1 but it's too little too late especially with Anderson's next move.  And now it is safe to conclude that the game is lost for black because of the mating attack.  Of more significance is that black won all of those pieces and being way ahead you'd think the opposite.  But Anderson however had it all planned out which means that there is no way out of it.
446,13,20,2Be7#,b'r1bk3r/p2pBpNp/n4n2/1p1NP2P/6P1/3P4/P1P1K3/q5b1 b - -',From my perspective the moral of the story is the same as the advice that Jack Stockel gave me in our last game.  Don't get too comfortable just because you're ahead.  What's important to remember here is what I've also learned from the blitz Q sacs.  Just because you are getting a lot of material doesn't mean you're going to win.  Not being overly confident and comfy means understanding theory and knowing how to continue.  I think that Kieseritzky's failure to do so is what led to his downfall.

469,14,22,2Rdxd3,b'6k1/ppp2pp1/2n1r1qp/8/4pQ2/2PRR3/PB3PPP/6K1 b - -',Another mistake.  Either Rf1 or Re1 would have been better.  Now things are about to get ugly for White.  You don't want your opponent to have a passed pawn so close to promoting.  Not having an escape route for your king also causes some of this trouble due to potential for a back-door mate.  White will be constricted in their choices because they will leave themselves open to mate otherwise.
470,14,23,2Rxe6,b'6k1/ppp2pp1/2n1R1qp/8/5Q2/2Pp4/PB3PPP/6K1 b - -',I haven't explored it fully but Bd1 might be worth considering as well.
471,14,24,2h3,b'6k1/ppp2pp1/2n1q2p/8/5Q2/2Pp3P/PB3PP1/6K1 b - -',Major blunder.  White desperately needed to play Qd2 here (which would have been followed by 22. ... Qe2) but this move seals White's doom.
472,14,25,2Qe1+,b'6k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/8/5Q2/2Pp3P/PB3PP1/4q1K1 w - -',Now White can only trade queen for pawn and slowly die.
473,14,26,d1=Q,b'6k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/8/2P2Q2/7P/PB3PPK/3qq3 w - -',This game was really close for a while but a few key mistakes let it slip away.  Black was able to capitalize on a back-door mate threat to ram a pawn down the center for promotion.  Thanks for your comments/review.
474,15,0,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So by playing it differently this is as though it were the QGD as noted.  So the way to decline is by not taking which is what she does.  Instead Sue plays an interesting move by developing her B.  Consequently I for it by exchanging her center pawn for my c pawn.
475,15,1,Nc3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Being that my c pawn is now on the d file I develop my Nb1 at once because I want both N's out before the B.  It's based a little on what Susan Polgar said about having a good outpost because strategy is important.  If I don't play well Sue won't learn.
476,15,2,c6,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Interesting move with a nice pawn chain.  I was considering a line a little similar to the Domiano with a sac that I come to now realize would've been unsound.  I was having Ghost Vision since the f pawn never advanced which is very good for black.  With that being said I almost played 7.Nxd5?? with the idea being 7...cxd5 8.Qa4+  But what stopped me from playing that terrible blunder was her Nf6.  With that being said I overlooked her Queen because if I took she could've and probably would've recaptured with the Queen in which the plan is foiled and spoiled.
477,15,3,Bd3,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',With the N's developed I decide to continue with my development.

Aside from development nothing came into consideration except for breaking the pin this way.  And it's only because Jack Stockel said that this is the best way to break a pin like this.

I realize that I don't need to do it so fast when I can take advantage of the fact that black moved the same piece twice.  So I attack it as afterwards I can pick which strengthens my mobility as now both of my rooks are also connected in the process.  With that being said I still have no problem with exchanging either since I don't wind up with doubled pawns.  That's because to me having my Rooks connected as they will be is of even more importance.  I also kept in mind that she couldn't attack my Queen under the same ground."
482,15,8,1O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/Q2P4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',?! But castling should've held off another move though.  I also saw this and asked myself what if Sue plays 10...b5  I asked if I'd win anything by doing that.  I studied one or two variations that does win.  But that's all I looked at.  I should've been more mobile because black should not lose material from that.
483,15,9,1Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/Q2P4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Not to my surprise though Sue continues with her development.

The idea is stricking in the center as I've learned from elyhim in one of his recent annotations.  But black still has the option to play 11...b5  But her next move however is going to lose material as we're about to see. 
485,15,11,1b6,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1ppp/1ppb1n2/3p4/Q2PP3/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? After which I coach her but forgot that she could've harassed my Queen which means that I did a hate pet of mine and told her the wrong thing.  That's because I said This is your first blunder. I know what you were thinking since this is a finchetto. That's how I think when the time is right because long diagnols are nice to have. But there was a danger with this move because it leaves that same diagnol unprotected due to my Queen being in that area. And that e pawn is dangerous. By playing this more then one piece is unprotected. Best for black would've been to exchange with 11...dxe4 After which I'd answer with 12.Nxe4 and after 12...Nxe4 13.Bxe4 the position is still even.  However I made a mistake here soon because you could've fianchettoed without losing material.  So with that being said just as good would've been 11...b5 and after something like 12.Qb3 12...dxe4 is just as effective.
486,15,12,dxe4,b'1rbq1rk1/p2n1ppp/1p1Q1n2/8/3Pp3/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',And now she exchanges.  But what was good earlier doesn't work at this point.
487,15,13,Ra8,b'r1bq1rk1/p2n1ppp/1p1Q1n2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I told her that this was a blunder by saying ?? I know why you played. You wanted to protect your Rook. But it was protected by your Nd7. With that being said I considered and had in fact almost played 14.Qxb8?? which would've lost my Queen. With that being said your best move was to hit my Queen with 14...Ne8 as I'm forced back. But just about anything else was better then this move. By playing this the Rook is now unprotected which is going to cost black more material.  However I was wrong because I looked at all but one variation.  With that being said Sue yes I was still going to play 15.Qc6 but you're ok if you play 15...Rb8 due to your Nd7.  Having had overlooked that I stop saying anything after this because of what ION mentioned with the idea of not overdoing things when you have a winning advantage.  But I will be pointing out mistakes during the annotation though.
488,15,14,Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/1pQ2n2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? This however is the move that loses material because as noted above you wouldn't have lost anything else had you played 15...Rb8
489,15,15,Qe8,b'r3qrk1/pQ1n1ppp/1p3n2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',My guess is that Sue wanted to place pressure on the center.  Now I was wondering what to do here but figured that I could liquidate by placing her in check.  The idea is to exchange when ahead.
490,15,16,1Bb4,b'r3qrk1/pQ3ppp/1p3n2/8/1B1P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Still thinking about how else to continue I decided to go after Rook.
491,15,17,1a5,b'r3qrk1/1Q3ppp/1p3n2/p7/1B1P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - a6',I was going to call this a blunder during the annotation as 18...Rb8 appears to protect the Rook but after I retreat I can still grab the Rook.  So the truth is that there are no good moves left.  Yet I like Sue's fighting spirit though.
492,15,18,a4,b'r4qk1/5ppp/1Q3n2/8/p2P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',As now she is trying to pull a swindle.  With the idea being that if I'm not careful although not passed now she could threaten to get a passed pawn.  Although there are ways to stop this kind of thing I believe that what Sue has in mind is to hit my Queen with ...a3 followed ....axb2 to follow.  Although there's no swindle here she would get some counterplay.  
493,15,19,2a3,b'r4qk1/5ppp/1Q3n2/8/p2P4/P2B1N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',But as a trainer my job is to stop that.  So the idea is preventing the passed pawn and working my way from there.
494,15,20,2Qe8,b'r3q1k1/5ppp/1Q3n2/8/p2P4/P2B1N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I am not sure why Sue played this.  Now I did consider 22.Bb5 to hit the Queen.  But I then asked myself what happens when she moves.  So I did not see the point of doing that.
495,15,21,2Bc4,b'r3q1k1/5ppp/1Q3n2/8/p1BP4/P4N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Therefore I played this to pin her f7 pawn since for the same reason that I played this against dynamic_dv which was blunderous.  But for me it doesn't matter as long as it worked it one game because the idea is trial and error that's how it works.  What I did learn from that is that it doesn't work on all games so you still have to base on the position.  But it works here because I'm not just doing it for the thrills and giggles of a pin as it appears.  Yes that's the prime reason but the secondary reason is that I am threatening to trap her Queen as we're about to see since I learned how to do something like this from reversion.  That's because I played an inaccurate during the KG which got my Queen trapped.  So I am using his strategy.
496,15,22,2Nd7,b'r3q1k1/3n1ppp/1Q6/8/p1BP4/P4N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Which Sue delays by hitting my Queen.
497,15,23,2Qd6,b'r3q1k1/3n1ppp/3Q4/8/p1BP4/P4N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So I put a little pressure on her center.  Now just like before I considered exchanging Queens with 23.Re8 to centralize a Rook.  Although exchanging is good I felt that I had something because of my next move which is where that threat becomes real.
498,15,24,2Nf6,b'r3q1k1/5ppp/3Q1n2/8/p1BP4/P4N2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',? But this is a mistake as your best move would've been 23...Qf8 Sue.  Sure an exchange is forced but it's better then what's about to happen.  That's because not only are you about to lose another pawn but it's the weakest pawn on the board which now leaves the K exposed.  It's worth noting that I also kept this in mind when pinning the f7 pawn for I am using TA's strategies in his blitz Q sacs for this position.  As that's where he emphasizes the same thing that GM Susan Polgar teaches in one of her lectures being that the f pawn is the weakest pawn on the board.  And once it's removed you're in trouble.  But it applies here even more because black is way behind in material.
499,15,25,Rd8,b'3rq1k1/5ppp/3Q1n2/6N1/p1BP4/P7/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? Not to my surprise Sue hits my Queen.  But as noted I am going to remove the weakest pawn to compromise blacks position even further.  However this is a blunder as black will is going to lose her other Rook in the process without compensation at the least.  But there are no good moves left as black is in trouble so it boils down to all other moves being better then this.  
500,15,26,Kxf7,b'3r4/5kpp/3Q1n2/8/p2P4/P7/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?? I know that you didn't want to lose the Rook Sue but that was the best alternative.  So with it best was to take back with 26...Rxd6 as this move is going to lose the Queen after which mate is not far off.
501,15,27,h6,b'3Q4/5kp1/5n1p/8/p2P4/P7/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',I am not sure why she played.  But unlike before no move is as good or bad as another.  In fact not before but at this point I would've resigned as black under this ground.  That's because there's nothing else and thus no more to learn because no move is as good or bad as another at this phase.
502,15,28,2Rfe1,b'3Q4/5kp1/5n1p/8/p2P4/P7/1P3PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',Forget about what I said earlier.  As now this wasn't played to centralize the Rook.  In fact  this gives me a mating attack.  That's because I considered pushing my passed and thus almost played 28.d5 with the idea of threatening to promote.  But I realize that with this much material I don't need an extra Queen as there is a mating sequence somewhere that I can take advantage of.  As now I'm threatening 29.Qe8#  However even after she defends against it with 28...Nh7 it's still mate.
503,15,29,Kf4,b'8/6pn/4Q2p/4R3/p2P1k2/P7/1P3PPP/R5K1 w - -',I studied this variation after finding 29.Qe8+.  For black's only other option was 31...Kh4 but then I would mate with 32.g3#.
504,15,30,3Qf5#,b'8/6pn/7p/4RQ2/p2P1k2/P7/1P3PPP/R5K1 b - -',"After this game I gave her my take.  Usually I call it the moral of the story but it's not because of my inaccuracies.  But they're important to keep in mind.  So what I said this was something new and different. First in the future I'm not going to let myself get mixed up in the future for what opening you'd like. You played ok until that fianchetto. I know how easy it is to want to fianchetto and get a nice long diagnol as I've always felt more comfortable in the process. But what's important to remember is that there's a time and place to do it. If the position demands something first though then the need should be taken care of. For example you played ...b6 but overlooked that your DSB was hanging. Had you exchanged the pawns and then Knights white wouldn't have won material as early. Then a different move was a blunder. I did make one mistake though for had the Rook moved back you wouldn't have lost another piece. But then you moved your LSB instead which lost a second piece as well as a pawn. From there it went downhill. My advice is actually the same as what Ken gave to me in our current game to look at things from a more mobile perspective.  The real moral that ties into this Sue as it is instructive for the future due to this being a training that if someone plays something different then you're used to don't get overwhelmed.  In all situations stay calm and focused.  Try to think of it as something like a Yoga Class.  So my new take on it is to expect the unexpected.  Therefore as the saying goes ""if life throws a lemon at you make lemonade.""  Yes that's also something I've had to learn the hard way.  What really helped with this believe it or not was my first game against elyhim for he played something that I wasn't used.  For at the time I had no experience with the Caro Kann so getting overwhelmed and nervous is what caused me to rush.  After which Terence told me or less the same thing in that game being to stay calm and relaxed."
505,16,0,g4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq g3',My opponent was in mood for bizarre openings. This one is one of the trickyest. Experience has taught me that best is just to avoid to create weaknesses on the affected squares and develop with a plan. Without trying to take any advantage from white's move that's the point.

540,17,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Although I like 1.e4 since it's in my style the stronger players prefer this opening.  Plus it's what Sue is most used to so I was outvoted there.
541,17,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This could've also become the QPG with the obvious 1...d5 something tells me that he wanted us to play the Colle's Franketort System since 2.e3 was a unanimous agreement.
542,17,2,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Although it is a known Fritz disagrees with our decision.  Even though I agree that this is solid but according to them 2.Nf3  With the main continuation being 2...d5 3.Nc3 e6 4.e3 Nc6 5.Bd3 Bd6 6.0-0 0-0 7.a3 h6 8.Bd2 Ng4 9.Nb5
543,17,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',He wanted a nice long diagonal for his B but I think he also wanted to transpose this into the KID since e3 is played later on.  But we put a stop to that with our next move.  And according to Fritz's analysis black didn't play the best move either.  According to Fritz though black's best move was 2...d5 with the continuation being 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Bb5 a6 8.Bxc6+ bxc6 9.Ne5 cxd4 10.Nxc6  In addition Fritz also indicated with the best move of 2...d5 the position is equal.  But with this move white now has a 0.03 with the most common move being 3.Nf3 as that should now lead to 3...Bg7 4.c4 0-0 5.Nc3 d6 6.Be2 c5 7.0-0 cxd4 8.exd4 Nc6 9.d5 Ne5 10.Nxe5 dxe5 11.Be3 Bf5 12.g4 Bd7 13.h3  Therefore we don't play the most common move since we all agreed on 3.Bd3. 
544,17,4,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',With this move the advantage increases to 0.04 in our favor according to the analysis after black's move.  And now the analysis agree with us until our fifth move.  That's because we played 5.c4 but we did discuss about castling.  Actually I believe it was ION who told us what might happen if we castle which is how 5.c4 was decided upon.  But according to the analysis that would've been our best move.  That's because they continue with 5.0-0 d5 6.c4 dxc4 7.Bxc4 Nc6 8.Nc3 a6 9.Ng5 h6 10.Nge4 Nxe4 11.Nxe4 b5 12.Bb3 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Bd5.  But after we play our fifth move the position is equal.  As now the main continuation is 5...c5 6.Nc3 cxd4 7.exd4 d5 8.0-0 Nc6 9.Be3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Ng4 11.Rc1 Bf5 12.h3 Nxe3 13.fxe3 Rc8 14.g4 Nb4 15.Qe2 Qc7 16.gxf5 Qxc4 17.Qxc4 Rxc4
545,17,5,d6,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',But according to them despite 5...d5 being the most common there is nothing wrong with this move whatsoever and gives this as an equal position.  Now they say that we should continue by castling with the main idea of 6...c5 7.d5 Bg4 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 Nbd7 10.Nc3 Ne5 11.Qe2 Nxd3 12.Qxd3 Nd7 13.e4 Ne5 14.Qe2 e6 15.Be3 Qh4 16.Rad1 Rad8 17.b3

Unlike before however they give this as an inaccuracy as now black has a 0.08 advantage after 6...Bg4 with the continuation being 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Be2 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 e5 10.d5 Nd4 11.Be3 Nd7 12.0-0 c6 13.Bg4 Nf6 14.Bh3 Qb6 15.Qd2 Qb4 16.dxc6 bxc6
547,17,7,Nbd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ -',?! But this move gives us a 0.05 initiative according to them with our next move.  They continue this afterwards with 7...c5 8.d5 Ng4 9.0-0 Nde5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Be2 f5 12.f4 Nf7 13.Qc2 fxe4 14.Nxe4 Qb6 15.Rb1 Bd4+ 16.Kh1 Bf5 17.Bd2 a6 18.Rfe1

But it's not nearly as bad because our edge has diminished from 0.05 to 0.03 starting with our next move.  From there the line continues with 8...Nc5 9.0-0 a5 10.h3 b6 11.Bg5 Qd7 12.Qd2 Bb7 13.Be3 c6 14.b3 Rac8 15.Rac1 Ra8 16.Bc2 cxd5 17.exd5 a4 18.b4  Even better would be 12.Be3 Bb7 13.Qe2 c6 14.h3 cxd5 15.exd5 Rac8 16.Rad1 Ba6 17.Ng5 Rfe8 18.b3 as now we have a 0.04 advantage.

However I believe it changes because the first few moves were similar to the Game DB on this website.  So Fritz is calling this as another inaccuracy and keeps us a little better after 9.a3  Of course we don't stick to it as 9.Bg5 is agreed on.
550,17,10,Bg5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',?! But with this move Fritz says that we lose a little bit of our advantage.  So we go from a minimum to only a slight edge as black's best move is 9...Qc7  
551,17,11,Nb6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',?! But with this move what we lost comes back after 10.b6 or 10.Qe2 which according to Fritz is our best move.  
552,17,12,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/1n1p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',?! But with this move we've lost our initiative.  As now The position is equal after 10...Bg4.
553,17,13,1Bd7,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/1n1p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',"?! However this also gives us back the initiative if we play 11.b3 11.h3 or 11.0-0  In it says that ""White is minimally better."""
554,17,14,1O-O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/1n1p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R b - -',?! Once again Fritz does not agree with this decision.  And it was hard because castling short also came up.  But according to them this is inaccurate as we lose a little bit of our intitative after 11...a6 or 11...h6 as we go from minimum to only a slight advantage. 
555,17,15,1Na4,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/n1P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R w - -',But Fritz says that this move is even better then those other positions as this equalizes the position.  It suggested that we exchange with 12.Nxa4 but 12.Bc2  Let's see what Fritz says about that.
556,17,16,1Bc2,b'r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/n1P1P3/2N2N2/PPBQ1PPP/2KR3R b - -',?! They're calling this an inaccuracy because black now gets a slight initiative with his next move.  That in return forces our next move to prevent the loss of a piece.  What this means which I agree with is that his Na4 is the weak N since it's on our rim.  Whereas our Nc3 was better placed and thus the strong N.  So this exchange winds up hurting our position.  After that black penguin_ maintains his advantage after 13...b5 since Fritz also agrees with this.
557,17,17,1Nd2,b'r2q1rk1/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/1ppPp1B1/2P1P3/2Q5/PPBN1PPP/2KR3R b - -',"However Fritz gives a very interesting line and says that black's advantage increase by sacking a piece.  They suggest 14...Nxd5 after which ""Black is clearly better.""  I don't agree with that since I don't see an immediate advantage but I'm still gonna assume that they're correct because TA outlined that Fritz analysis is an equivalent to an analysis that you'd get from I believe it is a 2100 or 2200 rated player."
558,17,18,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/1pP1P3/2Q5/PPBN1PPP/2KR3R w - -',?! But they gave this as an inaccuracy because after 15.Qf3 or 15.Qe3 black's edge now decreases.  As now his advantage is slight.
559,17,19,1Qg3,b'r2q1rk1/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/1pP1P3/6Q1/PPBN1PPP/2KR3R b - -',?! But with this move black's initiative increases a little bit and now ends up with a minimum advantage after 15...Re8

561,17,21,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/3b1pbp/3p1np1/p1pPp1B1/1pP1P3/3B2Q1/PP1N1PPP/2KR3R b - -',But they said that this was just as good where black's edge remains slight.  They recommended 16...h4 16...Kb1 or 16...f3
562,17,22,1a4,b'r2q1rk1/3b1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/ppP1P3/3B2Q1/PP1N1PPP/2KR3R w - -',"They also gave this move as just as good and recommended 17.h4 17.Kb1 or 17.h3 for white.  However the analysis stops here.  That's because up until this point this game was continuing at ""Chicoboy's Legacy"" Club.  But at this point it stops working out.  Therefore someone unfortunately wound up leaving that club.  And the thread which had the discussion that led to this point got deleted.  So I used Fritz to fill in the gaps.  If you'd like I can continue with this analysis but it would have to be under commented annotations as I'm worried that there will be so much that the game gets deleted.  So let's start with the discussion here.  So Qa4 is the move that we mentioned but that was a typo so that we don't get confused because Qh4 is what we're alluding to.  Sue: Ion had suggested the following as possible moves before I resigned from the club. Qh4' f3and h3. I quite. like Q h4.  Joe: I also do. Those other moves are good but I think that bringing the Queen on that square is more powerful and forceful.  "

Joe: In this position I did consider exchanging with bxa3 but my fear is if we played that instead of taking back with the pawn he can recapture with the Rook which would give him a passed pawn. A known way to stop this is with b3 as not only haven't we've exchanged but we prevent a passed pawn with a pawn chain.  Sue: Seems like the best idea my vote also goes with b3.  Ron: I would vote also for b3 for reasons mentioned

I was thinking about Bxf6 which is the only other option that doesn't lose material. But I don't think that exchanging is the way to go in this position because it's unclear if we need the pieces or not. Plus our Bg5 appears more active then our his Nf6.  Ron: I vote for Be3 seems to be a good choice!  Sue: I have had second thoughts BxP BxB QxB and we are up a pawn. Think about it after that I might be a good idea to play Qg3 and push the h pawn to try and. breakthrough. Or try a Rook lift along the h-file. Blacks bishop is preventing our breakthrough.  I am doing an online chess course at that is where I got my ideas from.  Joe: I agree with Sue. Thing with Be3 is that black can answer with 1... g5. I'm thinking about this because after something like 2.Qg3 Nh5 3.Qg3 g4 4.Qe2 white has lost some tempii which could play an important role at this phase. If we take right away losing time wouldn't be a problem. And we prevent black's Nf6 from becoming more powerful.   
567,17,27,1Bxh6,b'r2q1rk1/3b1pb1/3p1npB/2pPp3/1pP1P2Q/pP1B4/P2N1PPP/2KR3R b - -',Sue: Move made BxP. Had to move running low on time. Black to move.

Joe: In this position which is where we stand I agree. For one thing we're a pawn up as opposed to a piece down for pawn. Plus with the Q on h6 black is now faced with a lot of pressure against his monarch. It doesn't happen yet but our Bd3 Nd2 and perhaps the Rd1 can all become a problem against black's monarch because we're eventually talking about buildup against that area. So not only is it virtually forced but even if we didn't need it to avoid the loss of material Qxh6 would still be my vote.  Sue: I am going to move Qxh6 now because it is the only obvious move and has two sufficient votes. Black to move.  
569,17,29,Ng4,b'r2q1rk1/3b1p2/3p2pQ/2pPp3/1pP1P1n1/pP1B4/P2N1PPP/2KR3R w - -',Sue: Black has moved Ng4. Looks like Qh3 is the only move. Black still threatens to fork a pawn. And Bishop. with a double knight fork on the Rooks to follow. The Bishop will threaten our Queen when the knight moves so that is a discover attack. At the very least we will lose a Bishop an Rook.  Joe: That makes the position difficult. Now it's what can we do to avoid losing the Queen. The only move that I think would prevent this is 1.Qh3 but then 1...Nxf2 forcing 2.Qf3 since the Queen is attacked twice after which he's gotten back a pawn for that reason. But more importantly is the fact that we lose a Rook for the N because of 2...NXR either on d1 or h1. As anything else appears to lose the Queen.  Ron: Do you have a suggested move?  Joe: Yes. As much as I don't like it Qh3 is the only move that I can suggest. In other words I'm pretty sure that it's the only way for us to avoid losing our Queen.  Sue: I am going to move Qh3.  Black's move.
570,17,30,Nxf2,b'r2q1rk1/3b1p2/3p2p1/2pPp3/1pP1P3/pP1B3Q/P2N1nPP/2KR3R w - -',Sue: Black has move Nxp. It's a choice really between Qh6 and Q f3 I choose Q f3.  Joe: I agree that those are the only options But I believe it or not like Qh6 the best. After he takes with ...NXR and we take back (which would happen regardless) our Nd2 would become realibility. With the Queen on h6 this would make Nf3 effective later on as we're now threatening Ng5 which would lose the Queen for N or get him mated. If he defends against that with ...f6 before that to stop Ng5 we can still play Nh4 which threatens Nxg6 and with the Queen on h6 our threat would remain dangerous. What that indicates is that a Q and N coordinated can become quite dangerous.  Sue: I have tried out your idea on the analysing board and it looks promising. I change my vote to Qh6.  Mike: ?? If I were Black I would not take the rook for N when I can win the B on d3 with check first then go back to f2 and the fork leaves me full rook up.  Sue: Qg3 stops NxB+ so perhaps this is the best move?  Joe: I agree with Mike. I thought he was saying that it was an automatic win for black but as usual misunderstood. Yes I see where and agree with Sue. As now that won't be possible. Maybe later Qh6 will be a vote. But for now I change it to Qg3.

Mike: You might want to also consider KxN because the Rook will have to move back to the Kside anyway.  Sue: I was considering KxN and it does seem to save a tempi. I change my vote to KxN.  Joe: It's always the question if which to take with as Susan Polgar noted. But after what Mike said I also change my vote because KXN seems the better of the two options.

And I agree with Sue because the N isn't active. As I also learned it's about where to place your pieces and bringing the N to a more active square. So we have a few choices. But my vote is Nf3 as that appears the most sensible. Bring it back on the first rank and it's less active. By bringing it there it appears to be the most mobile of any other spot. 
575,17,35,2Nf3,b'r2q1r2/3b1pk1/3p2p1/2pPp3/1pP1P3/pP1B1NQ1/P5PP/3K3R b - -',Sue: No more votes so have decided on Nf3 as that is the best move. Have played it Black's move.  Ron: been following the game  Joe: It now boils down to what black will do.

My vote would be Ng5 to enable our Queen to travel to f3 at some point with pressure against black's f7 pawn. Were it not for us being behind I'd find Qg5 with the idea of a Queen exchange to be a good idea. But it's better not to liquidate here unless we must. With that being said I can't find a better move then Ng5.  Sue: I agree with you Joe especially now black has control of the h file.  Ron: I vote for same Ng5.
577,17,37,2Ng5,b'r2q3r/3b1pk1/3p2p1/2pPp1N1/1pP1P3/pP1B2Q1/P5PP/3K3R b - -',"Sue: Ng5 has been played it is now black to move.  Isaac: I'm sorry I didn't see this.  I realize Ng5 has been played but it's an idle threat. 

There are two striking things about this position. 

1. The white bishop is paralyzed. 
2. The white rook is...well also paralyzed.     
White should try to improve either of those pieces. 

Ng5 could give the bishop a way out but I think f7 by black is going to create a nice wall. 

The only way to fight that wall is to get the white queen out of the way of the g pawn and push the pawns on g and h files. 

This will also give room to white's rook. 

Furthermore since the queenside is completely locked up (and white has the only knight) the king should move toward the central kingside. 

However ultimately the game looks lost for white. There is only a little play on the kingside and the only hope is to expose the king. That is why those pawns on h and g need to move forward. 

The queen needs to move out of the way I think  Sue: @pawntificator thanks for your much needed advice. My. suggested next move will prolly be Qe1.  Isaac: The queen is now the only defender of the knight on g5 against the black queen so you can't abandon it now. Besides I think black will just play f6 ( I accidentally said f7 earlier) forcing the knight to retreat back to f3. After that white might be able to move the queen and push those pawns. 

But look for black to get the rooks on h8 and g8 or maybe f8 and run the king away to start a push of their own.  Sue: I change my suggest next move for white to Nhh3 that way black will get no where by doubling rooks.  We could either do that or move the knight back to f3 and then the Queen to e1.

I came back and it's starting to settle down. Not completely out of the woods since I switched shifts and thus will be working tomorrow morning. Once that sets it's settled for this week. Because of a tropical development with Tropical Storm Hermine changing it's course with the new possibility that it'll hit my area it could change again. But I've learned as noted in my annotation about Super Storm Sandy not to get overworked with things like that. Anyway I'm thinking about what to play next in this position. Not sure but think that Qf2 is best here as this would enable us to play h3 followed by g4 later on with the threat against the Rook. There might be ways to stop it but even then I currently don't know of a move that's better or as good as bringing the Queen back. So Qf2 is my vote for now but as usual could change.  Sue: I am going to move Qf2.  black to move.

I like g3 which attacks the Rook and appears to gain tempo but it is not my vote. As there is more and a bigger picture being that it would appear to leave our Queen out of play since it wouldn't be able to reach the g or h files. My vote would be Rf1 to break the half pin that black has on our Bf3.  Sue: If we move Rf1 black will take our h-pawn. We are already material down. We need a tie-breaker? I shall ask redfoxrising to vot.  Joe: That is true which I overlooked. What I did was the h pawn since it is our only Rook. It's a common problem called Ghost Vision since I forgot that the pawn was there. Ok my vote changes to g3. And since we're nearing the endgame I don't think that K safety is as much of a concern at this point. But I'm interested on Ron's take.

Possibilities are G3 G4 or Q f3 sooner or later we will need to move our Rook in case black doubles Rooks on h-file.  Joe: I'm not sure what to do. Will need to come up with a vote later on. It is a difficult position.  Sue: I like Bg4 followed by Bf5.  Isaac: Make sure you protect all your pawns while maneuvering.  Joe:  pawntificator is right because if the B moves white loses a pawn. With that being said my vote is Qe3 as that will enable us to play that sequence without losing more material.  Isaac: Do you have a reason for deciding between Qe2 and Qe3 or possibly even Re1?  Joe: Now that you mention it I do. I like Re1 so my vote changes to that as it centralizes the Rook. And this is where I apply what I've learned from elyhim. What he said was first centralizing the Rook is the way to control the center. Second center control isn't just important in the opening. At the time I only thought it mattered in the beginning but Terence said that it is also important in the mid and end games. In fact the annotation where he said was an example of the importance of center control in the late mid game. And he maintained a control with although a different position the exact same move since it centralized the Rook. This is what helped him to win that game.  Isaac: Black playing f5 seems to be the only immediate challenge to the position.  Joe: You're right. So the question is what can we do prevent that whilst adding a defender to the pawn. What I believe is that if the B stays where it is for much longer it's left with less mobility. And as we know mobility plays an essential role. I just don't know what else to do.  Isaac: g4 would do it but then our bishop loses all mobility until and IF black ever plays f5. 

I think protecting the pawn and trying to get the bishop out by Bf4 and Bg5 is the best plan. 

If f5 is played then perhaps just take and get the bishop more mobility by moving to e4. 

I'm not great at endgames but it looks like this should be a draw.  although if the rook moves to e1 then the queen can pin the bishop to the white queen. 

I probably shouldn't discuss this I only look in once in a while. I haven't really been involved in the game.  Ron: We each have a Queen Black has both Rooks we have a Rook and a Bishop 
Black will double the Rooks 

We each have blockades and our Bishop is better at blockading than his rook. 

We should get a draw I keep looking at g4 or Bg4 I support both of these.  Isaac: Bg4 looks really dangerous letting the queen behind enemy lines.  Joe: It's fine.  It doesn't matter the time in which you post for this game.  That's because I continued the game here at a later phase.  I agree and thus believe that we might very well have to give up the pawn.  It was hard but Qe3 is indeed my vote. It still doesn't prevent f5 from being played but the piece is protected and it prevents black from pinning our Bf3.     "

The lesson there is that ""you have to play out the draw first"" as he said. Meaning that you have to finish it out and be sure that it's a draw I guess.

A king move could be useful but not as a journey toward the kingside. The game is dead draw and our king is best kept in the center on our side. Our only fear is a push by the f pawn when we might have to defend against the e or g pawn. 

A king move is fine but don't go to g3 or we lose all defense. h2 is ok but serves no purpose. Keep the king in the center.  Ron: agree with Pawn game is drawish we need to keep it that way and keep king in center may be able to get a 3 move repeative draw will have to do our best with our opponent not accepting the draw.

However whie can simply play f3 and any hope of pressure on e4 ends. Looking back at it now it seems that the c-pawn is much weaker as the knight on b3 blocks white from playing b3.

756,20,82,4Be2,b'5r2/1k5p/1p1q4/p1rPpp2/P1P4P/1R3KP1/1Q2B3/8 b - -',So the bishop runs.
757,20,83,4Ka7,b'5r2/k6p/1p1q4/p1rPpp2/P1P4P/1R3KP1/1Q2B3/8 w - -',Maybe this final king move was not needed but I wanted to avoid any tricks with a pin along the b file. Any views dear reader?

769,20,95,4f4,b'6r1/k3r2p/1p1q4/pR1P4/P1PQppPP/8/4B1K1/8 w - -',So I plough on.

785,21,8,1Nf3h2,b'2kr3r/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/6p1/8/3P3P/PPP1BPPN/R1BQRNK1 b - -',Another good defensive move that makes me wonder how to break in. My pawns have to advance further under the fire of white's B. I need h5 to prevent a piece to land on g4 to make impossible for white to play h5 (blocking the column) and assuring that g5 would have openend the column. I can't avoid right now his pieces to go to g5: the only thing I can do is to sac the g pawn (12... g5) and only after play Rg8 h5 etc. It was a blitz so...
786,21,9,1Rdg8,b'2k3rr/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/6p1/8/3P3P/PPP1BPPN/R1BQRNK1 w - -',I can play h5 now but I am allowing...

1093,28,35,1b5,b'r2r2k1/q2nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppP5/2BP3B/1PN2Q2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - b6',This is a good move gaining space on the queen-side allowing his queen to get back into the game along the second rank and attacking my bishop. I could of course have taken the pawn en passant here. After 20.	cxb6 e.p. Nxb6 21. Qxc6 he can capture my d pawn so I don't gain a pawn so after a lot of thought I decided to retreat my bishop.
1094,28,36,2Bd3,b'r2r2k1/q2nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppP5/3P3B/1PNB1Q2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - -',I am now attacking c6 with the queen.

1102,28,44,2Kh1,b'3r1nk1/r2qbpp1/2p1pn1p/1pP5/pP1P3B/2NB4/P3QPPP/3RR2K b - -',I move my king to a safer square.

1118,28,60,3Kg2,b'3r2k1/2r2pp1/1Np1pbnp/1pP5/pP1PR3/5BP1/P4PKP/3R4 b - -',So I bring my king back into the game.

I think I need to get my king to c3 to protect the d pawn. However I can't move Kd3 because then e6-e5 wins a pawn for him. So I think my best move was Rd2 followed by Kd1-c2-c3.
1127,28,69,3Nf4,b'3r1k2/2r2p2/1Np1pb1p/1pP3p1/pP1PRnP1/4KB2/P4P1P/3R4 w - -',His knight comes in.

1138,28,80,4hxg5,b'3b1k2/2r2p2/1Np1p1np/1pP3P1/pP2R1P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 b - -',I exchange. The immediate Rd4 may also be good.
1139,28,81,4hxg5,b'3b1k2/2r2p2/1Np1p1n1/1pP3p1/pP2R1P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 w - -',I think it is better to take back with his bishop as now I take control of the d file with tempo.
1140,28,82,4Rd4,b'3b1k2/2r2p2/1Np1p1n1/1pP3p1/pP1R2P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 b - -',Like this.

In this calculations when deciding his moves earlier he didn't realize that this was check and he was planning to play Bd4 attacking f2. However even with say his king on g8 I think I would have an advantage as his queen-side pawns are dropping.
1145,28,87,4Ke7,b'8/3Nkp2/2p1pbn1/1pP3p1/pP4P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 w - -',So he has to move his king.
1146,28,88,4Nxf6,b'8/4kp2/2p1pNn1/1pP3p1/pP4P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 b - -',In these positions with pawns on both sides of the board the bishops are much stronger than the knights so I exchange.
1147,28,89,4Kxf6,b'8/5p2/2p1pkn1/1pP3p1/pP4P1/P4B2/2K2P2/8 w - -',He takes back.
1148,28,90,4Bxc6,b'8/5p2/2B1pkn1/1pP3p1/pP4P1/P7/2K2P2/8 b - -',I have not only gained my pawn back but this is easily won for me as his queen-side pawns are weak and my bishop is so much better than his knight.
1149,28,91,4Ne5,b'8/5p2/2B1pk2/1pP1n1p1/pP4P1/P7/2K2P2/8 w - -',He forks my bishop and pawn.
1150,28,92,4Bxb5,b'8/5p2/4pk2/1BP1n1p1/pP4P1/P7/2K2P2/8 b - -',I take. He can't recapture on g4 as after c5-c6 he can't stop my c pawn. 
1151,28,93,4Ke7,b'8/4kp2/4p3/1BP1n1p1/pP4P1/P7/2K2P2/8 w - -',So his king comes back.

1496,37,0,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Kings Gambit Fischer defense. I've played thousands of KG games as white (and hundreds of Latvian Gambits as black) yet this one was unique as I very soon found myself under early attack. Normally it's the other way around: the gambiteer should be the early attacker. That being said under a threat of mate Caissa smiled and I found a sneaky way out...and was able to turn the tables just in time.  
1497,37,1,O-O,b'rnbqk1nr/pp2bppp/2pp4/8/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',6. Bxf4 would have saved me a lot of trouble had I played it instead of 0-0. In playing the King's Gambit I've discovered that when you can safely recoup the f-pawn it's usually the right decision to make. The bishop and/or knight can most of the time relocate to safe havens after black advances g5 and g4.

I also missed the blistering 8. Bxf7+! Kxf7 9. Nxg5+ Bxg5 10. Qxg4 Bxf4. In blitz normally with the Kings Gambit I do not fianchetto the DSB. But here for some reason -- probably since I had more time to think -- I went against my intuition. And I soon regretted it.   
1499,37,3,g4,b'r2qk2r/pp2bp1p/2pp3n/3Pn3/4Ppp1/1PN2B2/PBP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',By now I'm regretting my 6th and 8th moves. The f-pawn should have been taken while I had the chance and my DSB should have never left the c1-h6 diagonal. My only consolation exists in the potential discovery on h8.

I was expecting 15...0-0-0 on the next move with a fantastic assault commencing. And the pawns on f4 and g4 were starting to look like the twin fangs of a snarling dragon. Plus I was still down a pawn with no material or positional compensation.

This move adds reinforcement to e4 and protects the c3 knight as I plan to swing my DSB back down to b1 aggressing the queen and hitting the f4 pawn twice. Basically praying for a miracle.

My mind blanked here and I actually thought I'd lost the game over this stupid oversight. I texted my opponent and congratulated him on the awesome move. I told him I'd need a few days to calculate some variations.

Kg2 out of sheer desperation) I went with this move fully expecting him to play 24...Kd8 and escape to the queenside. Had he played it I would have most likely continued with 25. Kg2 (as 25. Nxf6+ Kc7 26. d6+ Kb8 goes nowhere and ...Qxh2# still must be dealt with). Suddenly Caissa smiled at me once again :)

I would think black wants to prepare to defend his king as his king is now vulnerable but he is beginning to bring down his pawns.  And with his queen at g6 and his pieces especially his LB on the king's territory at f3 he may feel he has a good attacking position.
1541,38,28,1Bg2,b'r2k3r/ppp2pp1/3p2q1/2bNp2p/3nP3/3P1bP1/PPPQ1PBP/R4RK1 b - -',I bring my LB back to g2 as I can retake with my king if black decides to capture my LB.  Although the queen is at g6 I am not worried as my pawns are intact and will defend any attack from the queen.

So what to do?  Of course if it takes then this will provide a hiding place for the king or the pawn may push to h3 and check the king.  This will be a nuisance and can be a big problem as black will be looking to queen this pawn in the future.
1544,38,31,1Ne7,b'r2k3r/ppp1Npp1/3p2q1/2b1p3/3nP2p/3P2P1/PPPQ1PKP/R4R2 b - -',I decide I need to distract black again and move Ne7 which is very risky.  The king has nothing to lose he won't castle anyway so can capture the knight.  The moves attacks the queen but seems to have no real threat as the queen can move away and leave the knight there as he poses no threat to the king!
1545,38,32,1Kxe7,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p2q1/2b1p3/3nP2p/3P2P1/PPPQ1PKP/R4R2 w - -',So the king captures as expected.  The king is now on e7 but I am not sure this gives me any chances to attack.  For my attack on the queen I am now down 2 pieces.

1549,38,36,1Qh5,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b1p2q/3nP3/3P1PpP/PPPQ2K1/R4R2 w - -',Now black moves his queen to h5 and it looks like it could all be over for white.  Watch this space!!

1554,38,41,2d4,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b1p2q/3PP3/2Q3pP/PPP3Kn/R6R b - -',I push my d3 pawn to d4 attacking black's DB at c5 and the pawn at e5.  I now have an attack on black's g3 pawn.  Black's queen now has access to e2 and a check on the king.  I think that this was a chance that black missed.  
1555,38,42,2exd4,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b4q/3pP3/2Q3pP/PPP3Kn/R6R w - -',Black captures my d4 pawn with his e5 pawn.  Now my queen is attacked but what will be my next move obviously take the g3 pawn which is en prise.  I think that the queen at c3 was a diversion for black which allowed him to miss the important point that my queen was not really a risk as I could not capture without the risk of losing my queen.  So the important thing for black was to protect his g3 pawn which he failed to do.
1556,38,43,2Qxg3,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b4q/3pP3/6QP/PPP3Kn/R6R b - -',The pawn is captured and now the knight is at risk.  I am down 2 pieces and 2 pawns.

1558,38,45,2Qxf3,b'r6r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b4q/3pP3/5Q1P/PPP3K1/R6R b - -',However this did not stop me taking the knight and should black capture the queen then my king would recapture.
1559,38,46,2Rae8,b'4r2r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b4q/3pP3/5Q1P/PPP3K1/R6R w - -',Black leaves the queen at h5 opposite my queen at f3 and moves his 'A' rook to e8 behind the king.  Perhaps a better place for the rook would have been f8 on the same file as my queen which may have forced me to move my queen.
1560,38,47,2h4,b'4r2r/ppp1kpp1/3p4/2b4q/3pP2P/5Q2/PPP3K1/R6R b - -',I push my h3 pawn to h4 protected by my h1 rook.  This allows my rook to move up the h file and also activate my 'A' rook.

1562,38,49,2Kh3,b'4r2r/ppp1kpp1/3p2q1/2b5/3pP2P/5Q1K/PPP5/R6R b - -',I move the king over to g3 using my h4 pawn to shield the king.  I think I may have been better moving my king onto the e file.  What I don't see is the fact that my king cannot move onto the g file now and black's rook can come down the h file.

I was already protecting my pawn but maybe I thought if black's d6 pawn came to d5 then I could capture this.  A better move would have been f4  protecting both my pawns but the white queen had no protection so that was not possible with the black queen at h6.
1567,38,54,2d3,b'3kr2r/ppp2pp1/3p3q/2b2Q2/4P2P/3p3K/PPP5/6RR w - -',Black pushes his d4 pawn to d3 attacking my c2 pawn.  This move was never going to go anywhere as I could recapture with my c2 pawn.

Black queen is also attacking my pawn at e4 along with the rook at e8 as well.  I think black's best move would have been to capture my pawn with the rook as this would have brought one of the rooks into play.  This would have caused more problems for me as up till now I only had to respond to the queen's attacks. 
1578,38,65,3Rf4,b'3kr2r/ppp2pp1/3p4/2b5/3qPR1P/3Q2RK/PP6/8 b - -',So I decide to protect the e4 pawn again by moving the f1 rook to f4.

1606,39,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq f6',The infamous Latvian Gambit. This opening is denigrated by chess masters and shunned by just about every GM you can think of. But for those adventurous (and crazy) enough to play it it can be a lethal weapon unlike no other opening for black. It is an opening for attackers for the tactically-minded and fearless who would rather go down with explosions and fire than fizzle-out positionally in a quiet endgame. 
1607,39,2,Nxe5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Taking the pawn on e5 with the knight opens the d1-h5 diagonal for the queen to immediately jump into the battle.  
1608,39,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I usually play 3...Nf6 here as black as I think it is more solid. But here I played 3...Nc6 (Fraser Defense) expecting a knight exchange. Although I'll have doubled-pawns on the c file after the smoke clears all my minor pieces will be open for quick deployment.

1617,39,12,d5,b'r1bqkr2/ppp4p/2n2n2/3p1Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq d6',The lone queen must move out of the wsb's sniper fire on c8. My opponent must also contend with the potential discovery from the rook on f8. And the pawn on e4 is attacked twice and defended only once by the besieged queen.

Qh6 on the other hand seems totally unambitious whereas the present move at least establishes a pin. Obviously white being up in material it would be eager to exchange queens should the opportunity arise.

But this move is needless; I am looking to simply tuck my king away on the queenside and begin positional play aimed at exploiting his weaknesses on f2 and c2 his premature queen exposure his unprotected king and his severe lack of development. Better was 13. b3 or 13. 0-0.

He has also subtly eyed the unguarded a7 pawn but I have other plans. With my next move I invite him to grab the pawn if he so chooses. I would indeed be delighted to have his strongest piece misplaced on the corner of the board pursuing a phantom attack.

If the knights are exchanged on d5 I will have removed his last developed minor piece and assumed total domination of the center. I will also take implied control of the d file.   
1628,39,23,Qxd5,b'2kr1r2/ppp4p/4b3/3q4/4p3/4Q2P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ -',I decided to recapture on d5 with the queen instead of the bishop as I too am now eyeing an unprotected pawn the one on g2. In light of 16. 0-0 my short-sighted plans are Rg8 threatening Bxh3.

From here I can bear down on f2 should white castle short and also occupy the a1-h8 diagonal in the event of white castling long.

Qa4+ black pushes c6 and the attack is over. If 22. Bxf8 the same mating continuation as before applies. As it stands white has to contend with all these threats: Rxd2 exd2+ exf2+ Qxf2+ and their attacking variations. 
1635,39,30,2O-O-O,b'2k2r2/Qpp4p/4bq2/8/8/BPPrp2P/P2P1PP1/2KR3R b - -',White here missed the crashing 20. Qa8+! which would have ruined everything for me: 20. Qa8+ Kd7 21. Qxf8 and the bishop on a3 supports f8. Instead white blundered by castling long (20. 0-0 was much better). I had already calculated the winning combinations the day before. My next move effectively ended the game. Can you find it?
