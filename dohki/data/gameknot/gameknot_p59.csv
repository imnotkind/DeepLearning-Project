Qxg6 Qg8 26.Rc2 and now both 26...Bf6 and 26...Bxa3 are good for Black. So it starts off awfully tempting to trade the d4 pawn for the f7 pawn but Black is not obliged to do that and seems to be fine even if he plays every expected move in the variation. Then I considered 18.Rf2 to double rooks but if White recaptures on f3 with a rook a knight capture on d4 becomes bothersome. Then I considered 18.Qd2 to defend the d-pawn but now ...Bg4 also opens up skewers with ...Bg5. What about 18.h3 which prevents ...Bg4 and could allow White to liquidate the doubled pawn with g3-g4-g5? It leaves the dark squares around the white king weak and White is already missing the DSB. So I ended up playing 18.Rd1 which also defends the d-pawn and is a slower way to double rooks but it could still be done if desired.

The queen and the knight on c3 in particular could be put to better use perhaps the queen on f5 or the knight on a4.

If 23.Na4 Black could try to stop the knight from continuing to b6 with 23...Qa5 (24.Nb6 Bd8 and 25.Nd7 Rc8 26.Ne5 fails to 26...Nxd4) but 24.b4 a move that is probably going to be played at some point anyway would change that.

It would destroy his kingside pawn structure remove an attacker of d4 and make f5 a nice-looking square for a knight. However White's pieces are not in very good spots to take advantage of these factors. For instance the quickest way to get a knight to f5 is to advance the g-pawn (allowing Ne2-g3-f5) but the half-open g-file gives Black counterplay against that pawn. Black also keeps his counterplay down the b-file. Trying to set up the sacrifice with 25.Qd2 was also considered but found wanting and Black could also reply 25...Bg5. White just doesn't have a strong enough position to sacrifice material.

You started this game with the most popular Master move (as per the GameKnot World Database)! This move is good because it opens lines for the LSB (light squared bishop) and the queen. More important you control the crucial d5 square and the secondary f5 square. In the opening you have a constant battle to control the primary center squares being d4 d5 e4 and e5. Whether you control them with pawns (as you are doing with your first move 1.e4) or you control them with pieces (as I do with my first move 1...Nc6) you must battle to control these squares! Also to a lesser degree the same principle goes for the secondary center squares being c3 c4 c5 c6 d3 d6 e3 e6 f3 f4 f5 and f6. Bottom line Rick to play well in the opening you must be a control freak. Control those squares!

Though it is not currently used in top level chess it is a great weapon to use in intermediate level games. Wikipedia states ""This opening is an example of a hypermodern opening where Black invites White to occupy the centre of the board at an early stage with pawns. Black's intent is to block or otherwise restrain White's central pawns and if allowed to do so by inaccurate play by White eventually undermine the White pawn centre by well-timed pawn advances of his own or by attacking the White pieces defending the centre."" See reference in comment below. I like this defence because it is not as studied by my opponents as more popular openings. *************************************************************************** The Nimzowitsch Defence is categorized as a Semi-Open Game. That is ""...a chess opening in which White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5. The Semi-Open Games are also called Single King Pawn Asymmetrical King Pawn or Half-Open Games (or Openings) and are the complement of the Open Games or Double King Pawn Games which begin 1.e4 e5.

If Black plays 2...e5 (considered by many to be the best move) now white can play the  Ruy with 3.Bb5 or the Piano with 3.Bc4. I won't allow that though since my reason for my previous moves is that I like the Nimzowich. And so....

So in chess you can't give away material without a reason. On my second move I offered a free pawn to you. I had a specific purpose in mind.

*************************************************************************** 
You need to get your king to safety!
I stated previously ""In the opening you have a constant battle to control the primary center squares being d4 d5 e4 and e5."" You also have a constant battle to gain development. This means you need to get your pieces out as quickly as you can and preferably before your opponent. An army in it's original position(s) can neither defend no attack. Take a look at the final position. You finished with a bishop and 2 rooks on their original squares and the queen also on the back rank. You lacked development thus you could not ward off my attack. *************************************************************************** 
There are several ways to ensure your development is good: 1. Try to avoid moving the same piece repeatedly until you complete your development. Your development is complete when you have your knights bishops and queen off the back rank and you have castled so your rooks are connected. 2. Make threats against your opponent. What I played 6...h6 you could not prepare to develop your bishop for example with 7.b3 since you would lose your knight. 3.Check your opponent's king with a developing move. For example when I played 15...Bc5+ you may have wanted to play 16.Qe2 (a good developing move) but you couldn't because of my check on your king.  *************************************************************************** There are times it is okay to disregard this principle along with all the principles of the game. This is when you have very forceful threats which your opponent can't counter effectively. For example why think about development if you have a forced mate in 3 moves?"

In retrospect that probably would have been the better move. It would have connected the pawn chain on K side and provided a barrier between my opponent moving Qh5+.

Given the initiative and a clear plan we 1800 players can do quite well but when it comes to defence we can do quite poorly. Here I start to drift I feel I should have played 17....e6 but didn't as I was worried about a future Nd6

When the master got into a bad position he hung tough and remained optimistic and when his chances came he pursued the attack whereas black when things got tough started to play weakly before folding.
Lesson: Hang tough and be positive that way you're more open to opportunities that come you're way."
159,7,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I am annotating this game for Zhanna - Zhannetka-84. This opening move 1. d4 is fine. I usually play it myself!
160,7,1,e3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. e3 is a bit passive. I would play 2. c4 and enter the Queen's Gambit. There are opening databases on Gameknot which can help you play the openings without making any major mistake.
161,7,2,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',3. c3 is often played in this system although I prefer to play Bd3 or Nf3 to develop a piece or 3. f4 is more aggressive. 
162,7,3,c6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black seems to be playing follow my leader!
163,7,4,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',4. Nf3 is good developing a piece. However it does block the f pawn. I quite like the idea of playing f2-f4 Nf3 Bd3 0-0 and then the Bc1 can come into play Bc1-d2-e1-h4. If black wasn't careful white would build up a good attacking position. In this game white's bishop on c1 is not very well placed.
164,7,5,Bd6,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black breaks the symmetry!
165,7,6,Nbd2,b'rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',5. Nb1-d2 is another sound developing move but doesn't help the problem of what to do about this bishop on c1. b3 followed by Bc1-a3 was another option but by moving the knight from b1 this is no longer an option as the knight defended a3.
166,7,7,Nh4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/2pbpp2/3p4/3P3N/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Nh4 is a bad move just wasting time. Bd3 or Be2 was better.

168,7,9,Nh4,b'rnbqk1nr/pp5p/2pbpp2/3p4/3P2pN/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',It is better to put the knight here than retreat it.

Generally it is better to open up the position after developing pieces and castling. f3 allows black to open up the position.
171,7,12,1Qxf3,b'rnbqk2r/p3n2p/1ppbpp2/3p4/3P3N/1PP1PQ2/P2N2PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Nothing wrong with this move. I think it is best followed up with Bd3 0-0 and e3-e4 if possible to free the Bc1.
172,7,13,1Qg4+,b'rnbq1rk1/p3n2p/1ppbpp2/3p4/3P2QN/1PP1P3/P2N2PP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',This check shouldn't achieve anything. Black should retreat the king to h8 and then play Rf8-g8. It is not a good move by white.
173,7,14,1Qh5+,b'rnbq1r2/p3nk1p/1ppbpp2/3p3Q/3P3N/1PP1P3/P2N2PP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',But this is a good check as it is hard to attack the white queen while it is on h5

176,7,17,1Bxh7+,b'rnbq2k1/p3nr1B/2pbpp2/1p1p3Q/3P2PN/1PP1P3/P2N3P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',This is a very weak move. White gives up a bishop worth 3 points for a pawn worth one point.
177,7,18,1Qxh7+,b'rnbq2k1/p3n2Q/2pbpp2/1p1p4/3P2PN/1PP1P3/P2N3P/R1B1K2R b KQ -',And this move is very weak too. White gives up her most valuable piece the queen worth 9 points for a rook worth 5 points. White is clearly losing here.

181,7,22,2Ng5+,b'r1bq4/p2n3k/2pbp3/1p1p1nN1/3P3N/1PP1P3/P6P/R1B1K1R1 b Q -',This is an excellent move as no matter where the black king moves to white will be able to check to win the black queen. If the black king goes to the g file then white can play Ng5xe6 and give a discovered check to the black king from the white rook on g1 while simultaneously threatening Ne6xd8. Black can't save the queen.
182,7,23,2Kh6,b'r1bq4/p2n4/2pbp2k/1p1p1nN1/3P3N/1PP1P3/P6P/R1B1K1R1 w Q -',Because if the black king moves here or to h8 then white plays....

There are only two squares the black king can go to. If the black king goes to g1 then white wins with Ng5-f3 check forcing the king to h1 and then white can play rook takes Bishop mate. If black plays Kh1 immediately I think black is still mated. It takes a bit longer but basically white moves her bishop to b2 or a3 plays Nf3 and Ke2 to discover an attack by the Rook on a1 and white eventually plays Ra1xBg1 in most variations.
192,7,33,2c4,b'r1b5/p2n4/2p2R2/1p1p2N1/2PP4/1P2P1n1/P5k1/R1B1K1b1 b Q -',This another bad move. Oh Zhanna I hope your opponent does not see he can take your rook!

196,7,37,3Rxc4,b'r1b5/p2n4/8/6N1/2RP4/4P3/P4bk1/R1BK1n2 b - -',This is good picking up a pawn.
197,7,38,3Rc7,b'r7/p1Rn4/b7/6N1/3P4/4P3/P4bk1/R1BK1n2 b - -',This is good attacking the knight.
198,7,39,3Rxc8,b'2R5/p2n4/b7/6N1/3P4/4P3/P4bk1/R1BK1n2 b - -',This is a bad move. White should simply have taken the knight.
199,7,40,3e4,b'2b5/p2n4/8/6N1/3PP3/8/P4bk1/R1BK1n2 b - -',This move saves the e pawn.
200,7,41,3d5,b'2b5/p7/1n6/3P2N1/4P3/8/P4bk1/R1BK1n2 b - -',and this move saves the d pawn.
201,7,42,3Kc2,b'8/p7/1n6/3P2N1/4P1b1/8/P1K2bk1/R1B2n2 b - -',This was the only square the king could move to.
202,7,43,3Rb1,b'8/8/1n6/p2P2N1/4P1b1/8/P1K2bk1/1RB2n2 b - -',White at last gets the rook into play. This is a good move.
203,7,44,4Bf4,b'8/3n4/8/p2P2N1/4PBb1/8/P1K2bk1/1R3n2 b - -',This is a good move. If white can queen one of these pawns she should win.
204,7,45,4Kd2,b'8/3n4/8/p2P2N1/4PBb1/4n3/P2K1bk1/1R6 b - -',Kd2 is not a bad move but I prefer Kd3 immediately.
205,7,46,4Kd3,b'8/3n4/8/p2P2N1/2n1PBb1/3K4/P4bk1/1R6 b - -',Probably best under the circumstances.
206,7,47,4Rb3,b'8/3n4/8/p2P2N1/4PBb1/nR1K4/P4bk1/8 b - -',This is a reasonable plan but there is a drawback.
207,7,48,4Kd2,b'8/8/8/p1nP2N1/4PBb1/nR6/P2K1bk1/8 b - -',I tend to prefer Kc3 so if black takes the rook on b3 white can take back with the king attacking the other knight on a3. This then gives white time to advance one of her pawns.
208,7,49,4Kc3,b'8/8/8/p2P2N1/4PBb1/nnK5/P4bk1/8 b - -',Another terrible move. White should just take the knight on b3 with the pawn on a2.
209,7,50,4Bxc1,b'8/8/8/p2P2N1/4P1b1/n1K5/P4bk1/2B5 b - -',This is a great move reducing White's material deficit.
210,7,51,4Kd3,b'8/8/8/pn1P2N1/4P1b1/3K4/P4bk1/2B5 b - -',Kd3 is as good as anything as Kc4 is met with Be2 check.
211,7,52,4Bd2,b'8/8/8/pn1P2N1/4P1bb/3K4/P2B2k1/8 b - -',Bd2 is a good move attacking the pawn on a5.
212,7,53,4e5,b'8/8/3n4/p2PP1N1/6bb/3K4/P2B2k1/8 b - -',This is good too attacking the knight and advancing the pawns.
213,7,54,5Bxa5,b'8/8/8/Bn1PP1N1/6bb/3K4/P5k1/8 b - -',This is a mistake as the bishop was guarding the knight on g5. She has to move the knight before taking the pawn. Kc4 to support the advancing pawns was another good move.
214,7,55,5a4,b'8/8/8/Bn1PP1b1/P5b1/3K4/6k1/8 b - a3',It is a good idea to advance pawns in an endgame like this.
215,7,56,5Bb4,b'8/8/8/3PP1b1/PB4b1/n2K4/6k1/8 b - -',and good to keep attacking ht eknight.
216,7,57,5Bxa3,b'3b4/8/8/3PP3/P5b1/B2K4/6k1/8 b - -',White has played well to get back to being equal on material and her pawns should even give her winning chances.
217,7,58,5d6,b'3b4/8/3P4/4P3/P5b1/B2K1k2/8/8 b - -',so these pawns have to be pushed...
218,7,59,5Bc1+,b'3b4/8/3P4/4P3/P4kb1/3K4/8/2B5 b - -',But know white just throws one of them away.  bb2 or Kd4 would have protected it.
219,7,60,5d7,b'3b4/3P4/8/4k3/P5b1/3K4/8/2B5 b - -',and now white throws away another one. Ba3 protecting the pawn was called for.
220,7,61,5Bb2+,b'3b4/3b4/8/4k3/P7/3K4/1B6/8 b - -',It is not a bad idea to check black. The last white pawn is doomed. However the position should be drawn.
221,7,62,5Bc3,b'3b4/3b4/8/3k4/P7/2BK4/8/8 b - -',Keeping the king and bishop together is a good idea.
222,7,63,5Bg7,b'3b4/6B1/8/3k4/b7/3K4/8/8 b - -',so moving it away is not a good idea.
223,7,64,6Ke3,b'3b4/6B1/8/1b1k4/8/4K3/8/8 b - -',It doesn't matter what white does the position should be drawn.
224,7,65,6Kf4,b'8/6B1/1b6/1b1k4/5K2/8/8/8 b - -',Any king move is ok.
225,7,66,6Kg5,b'8/3b2B1/1b6/3k2K1/8/8/8/8 b - -',Any king move will do again.
226,7,67,6Kh6,b'3b4/3b2B1/7K/3k4/8/8/8/8 b - -',Position should be drawn.
227,7,68,6Bh8,b'3b3B/3b4/7K/8/4k3/8/8/8 b - -',It is still a drawn position. I can say that with certainty as there are free endgame chess databases which which you can analyse endgames with 6 or less pieces. I am using one for these annotations. 
228,7,69,6Kh5,b'3b3B/3b4/8/5k1K/8/8/8/8 b - -',This should be a losing move! Black should play Bg5  and then Be8 is mate. See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=127358
229,7,70,6Be8+,b'3bb2B/8/8/5k1K/8/8/8/8 w - -',But black plays the moves in the wrong order!

231,7,72,6Kh7,b'4b2B/7K/8/5kb1/8/8/8/8 b - -',It doesn't matter if the king goes to h7 or g7 this position should be drawn again.
232,7,73,6Kg7,b'7B/6K1/6b1/5kb1/8/8/8/8 b - -',This is a dead draw.
233,7,74,6Bf6+,b'7B/6K1/5bb1/5k2/8/8/8/8 w - -',Now white comes up with a clever way of showing how drawn it is!
234,7,75,6Kh6,b'7B/8/5bbK/5k2/8/8/8/8 b - -',This moves looks silly allowing black to take the bishop on h8 but...
235,7,76,6Bxh8,b'7b/8/6bK/5k2/8/8/8/8 w - -',But white had cleverly spotted that if he takes the bishop the final position is a stalemate. many thanks for reading this. I hope you enjoyed it. Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system.

353,12,3,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',I chose the most active continuation in what is now a rare if not dead opening. In a twisted way White has surrendered a flank pawn (and isolated the a-pawn) in exchange for dominance in the centre of the board. This means that White must play positionally or attempt to win materal back if this isn't possible. Common variations usually see a bishop on a3 a queen in b3 and the rooks firing ominously down the centre.

356,12,6,Qd5,b'r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n5/3QP3/2B1P1n1/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',I take full charge of opening position and deliver an early checkmate threat that forces Black to react with 8...0-0. Now I can force on the Black kingsid3. It should be noted that although I have a dominant centre and a position benevolent to my cause I have paid the price with my disturbed pawn structure.

358,12,8,Nh6,b'r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n4n/3QP3/2B1P3/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ -',The question for White is what next? 9.Bxh6 gxh6 leaves an exposed king but needs a lot of time to generate an efficient attack a saviour to him. Since the knight cannot actually move anywhere (safely) this move will wait. 9.g4... threatens 10.g5... with a piece lost on Black's part.

378,12,28,3c5,b'8/p4kpp/3pNr1n/1ppP1p2/r6P/P1P2P2/3N1K2/R6R w - c6',Black makes en passant on c6 impossible and the passed pawn would be caught before he came to any use. He also threatens 31...b4 (32.cxb4 cxb4) and danger looms.

403,13,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',An oddly regular move played by Excalibur. It has a tendency to remove central pawns as quickly as possible.

White's f-pawn was perfectly strong where it was forcing my knight to manoeuvre around the back rank (e.g. Ng6-e7-g8-h6-f7-d6) The advance seems premature but not negative. Also it does allow the f1-rook to pursue other uses.

So in the following moves you declined the pawn. If ever you play the QG Accepted understand the reason for accepting the pawn is not to win a pawn. You can't hold it if your opponent knows what he is doing. The purpose in accepting the pawn is to get a semi opened d-file! In the process you also give white a semi open c-file. 

So for white to take advantage of his semi open c-file he has to move pieces e.g.: Qc2 and later Rc1. While for black to use the d-file the queen is automatically there. So you save tempo. "

Whether you control them with pawns (as we did with our first moves 1.d4 d5) or you control them with pieces (as I do with my 3rd move 3...Nc3) you must battle to control these squares! Also to a lesser degree the same principle goes for the secondary center squares being c3 c4 c5 c6 d3 d6 e3 e6 f3 f4 f5 and f6. Bottom line Rick to play well in the opening you must be a control freak. Control those squares!

So my pawn on d4 controls e5 (and c5).
My pawn on c4 controls d5 (and b5 though that's not one of the primary or secondary squares).
My knight on c3 controls e4 and d5.
Your pawn on d5 controls e4 (and c4).
Your pawn on e6 controls d5 (and f5).

So the battle is on for the center."

I am now a pawn up a pawn which by the way became a thorn in your side here and later in the game. The thorn begins with this pawn on b5 now hindering your queen-knight's development to c6. It went on later to become a passed pawn which you needed to sacrifice a bishop to stop."

I was thinking if I get pawns on a5 & b6 you play axb6 and before I take back I play Bc7 forking the b6 pawn and the rook. So when you move the rook then I take the pawn back (axb6) and have an advanced passed pawn. The more advance a pawn is the more dangerous and valuable it is. Having a well protected pawn on the sixth rank is Heaven (or Hell if the pawn is your opponent's). I needed not only to get my pawns in position but also needed more preparation due to you moving your rooks around. Yet in essence that was what I managed to do.

20...bxa5 21. Bxd8 Rxd8 22. Rxa5 Bb6 23. Raa1 Kf8 24. Rac1 Ke7 25. Bc4 Rd6 26. Bxd5 exd5 27. b4 d4 28. Rc4 dxe3 29. Rxe4+ Re6 30. Rxe6+ Kxe6

So you're still losing but not as bad as what you played. Even still I think you played really well in the line you did play. I think that combination would have worked on people much stronger than you."
633,18,34,2axb6,b'r5k1/2Br1ppp/BP2p3/2bb4/4p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',"Now this is the setup I was working for all this time!

My bishops and b6 pawn control or occupy the squares a7 b7 and c7. I am threatening to advance the pawn. As I see it you will need to sac something to stop that pawn!"
634,18,35,2Bxb6,b'r5k1/2Br1ppp/Bb2p3/3b4/4p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',And sac you did!
635,18,36,2Bxb6,b'r5k1/3r1ppp/BB2p3/3b4/4p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',So I take back leaving both bishops on the 6th rank and one attacked and defended once on a6. This sets up what looks at a glance like an easy way for you to win back the bishop. But as I demonstrated it's not so easy.
636,18,37,2Rd6,b'r5k1/5ppp/BB1rp3/3b4/4p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 w - -',There it is! You attack my bishop on b6. The b6 bishop can't be defended and if I move it you take the a6 bishop with a rook.
637,18,38,2Bc4,b'r5k1/5ppp/1B1rp3/3b4/2B1p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',So instead of moving the b6 bishop I move the a6 one leaving both hanging! (Well the c4 Bishop is not really hanging since your d5 bishop is pinned against your rook on d6.) You can't take either one since your rook is hanging on a8 with a mate threat on your back rank.
638,18,39,2Rxa1,b'6k1/5ppp/1B1rp3/3b4/2B1p3/4P3/1P3PPP/r2R2K1 w - -',So now you have to trade more. On one hand this does not remove the threat as I still have the same mate after I take back. On the other hand where is the rook to go if you choose not to trade? There are no squares he can go where my bishops won't cause trouble. So I think 23...Rxa1 was best.
639,18,40,2Rxa1,b'6k1/5ppp/1B1rp3/3b4/2B1p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R5K1 b - -',Now if 24...Rxb6 25.Bxd5 so it's just trading and I again have the mate threat.
640,18,41,2h6,b'6k1/5pp1/1B1rp2p/3b4/2B1p3/4P3/1P3PPP/R5K1 w - -',This is the same move I would have made yet GK analysis states you should have played 24...Rxb6 25. Bxd5 g5. Interesting...

655,18,56,3Rd7,b'1r4k1/3R4/1P4pp/2B2p2/4p3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',The best place for a rook is on the 7th rank when the opponent king is on the 8th. Inn this case also the rook & bishop work together to keep your king on the kingside away from the promoting pawn. Your king can only go back and forth between the g8 and h8 squares.
656,18,57,3Rc8,b'2r3k1/3R4/1P4pp/2B2p2/4p3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',"So you are in a form of Zugzwang here. Any move you make is going to help me. The move 32...Rc8 here just wastes time as you can't afford to take my bishop. But you had nothing better.

I also understand you are following my suggestion that you never resign a tutoring game as there may be more you can learn later in the game. I hope and think my teaching further on in the game will be worthwhile to you."
657,18,58,3b7,b'2r3k1/1P1R4/6pp/2B2p2/4p3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',Of course you can't take the bishop as I mentioned before.

659,18,60,3Rc7,b'4r1k1/1PR5/6pp/2B2p2/4p3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',So the goal is to trade rooks via 35.Rc8.

663,18,64,Kf7,b'2Q5/5k2/6pp/2B2p2/4p3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',So when mating with and endgame queen (or rook or bishop and knight) the goal is first to restrict the opponent king second to work the king over to one edge of the board.
664,18,65,3Bd4,b'2Q5/5k2/6pp/5p2/3Bp3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 b - -',So I want my bishop on e5. That would limit your king's movement to the kingside and behind the pawns. Notice my queen covers all light squares my bishop the dark ones to the left of your king with exception of e7.
665,18,66,3Ke7,b'2Q5/4k3/6pp/5p2/3Bp3/4P3/5PPP/6K1 w - -',So you do well to move away from the h-file where I want to send you.

However I pointed something out that is good to take note of.  In it I said In general advancing the a pawn early in the game is something that you don't want to do. Better is to advance a central pawn because this is what you call a non developing move a move that does not develop anything. The idea is to develop your pieces and central pawns to control the center. So better was either 1.e5 of 1.d5  Then he told me that he sees joveyboy1 play this a lot and btw I know him because we're friends on GK.  So I said ok that's a common thing that I've been seeing. The thing is that you generally will wind up better when your pieces are developed because the general idea is to fight for center control so you can contest the center. The one who does it first generally has an advantage.
729,23,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',However as I saw with database which I'm more careful with but agreed and would've played it anyway.  But this is the most common move to developing the a pawn early.  The idea is that while the opponent advances a non center pawn that doesn't help control the center you can then use that time right away to develop something on the center.  The idea is that a head lead in development is important and this way one gets to start exploiting weaknesses.
730,23,2,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/P7/1P1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I don't know why he played this as it's no longer an English Opening and can't transpose into one since the a pawn isn't developed.  The problem here is that it also does not develop or help control the center.  With that I'm going to bring another piece into play.
731,23,3,e3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/P3P3/1P1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',While it might not appear as you generally don't want to play e3 as guideline.  In this case it doesn't apply and this is actually a good move.  The thing is that 3.e4? would lose a pawn as I would capture with my f N.  Now I could develop my DSB but will wait until my next move.  That's because when he develops his c N I don't want to give him the option of exchanging on the e file with NXP.  So in this case 3...Nc6 will prevent that.

If he meant that this move protects it then I don't.  But if he meant that he doesn't have to worry about for now as it's safe then he is correct.  In it I said  Yes for now it is. And this is a common move in response to bringing out my c N."

However this is a blunder and an occasion where guidelines must be broken to avoid losing material.  In it I said normally that's the best move. But the problem is that leaves your LSB en-prise.  And he responded by saying ""Oh yea"" So I responded by telling him that in this case best was to either play 9.Bb5 or retreat back to the seventh rank or play 9.Bb1 The idea is castle early and often but at the same time it's important to access the position of say what's hanging does the move played present a risk. Can it be taken and what can my opponent. And always be ready for anything and everything or as they say ""Expect the Unexpected.""  @superandy: That's about doing your HW and another example of being your own spectator.  One thing to note is that there are general principles which aren't rules but guidelines.  However if following them means a mate from your opponent or loss of material then the guidelines have to be broken. "

So I had to repeat myself in order give the example of where sometimes there are exceptions in which you can't follow the guidelines.  In it I said I understand why you played it. The idea was for development. Now it's generally a good idea to follow General Opening Principles. But the thing is that those principles aren't rules but rather a set of guidelines to help in your games. The idea is to get your pieces out and control the center in the opening. However as you learned just now there are exceptions to them occasions where you can't follow those guidelines. 
739,23,11,1Qb1,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/1P2p1b1/P2qPN2/1B1P1PPP/RQ3RK1 b - -',Then I said What's important is looking at everything accessing the position by asking yourself if the opponent can win material mate you and if you're going to find yourself in a difficult situation trouble with that move. If any of those answers are yes then this is when you can't follow those guidelines. And this is one of those times. Best in this position was believe it or not 12.h3 And now 12...e4 would be a blunder as that you would win a piece back. If instead I played 12...Bxf3 you can take back with the h pawn or Q and it would wind up as an exchange.
740,23,12,1exf3,b'r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/1P4b1/P2qPp2/1B1P1PPP/RQ3RK1 w - -',"?? An outright blunder.  In fact with this move I felt very upset with myself that as a coach I made a blunder that I should not have overlooked.  That's especially when I'm training to train someone not to do this kind of thing.  In fact I lost a little sleep over this.  What happened is that I overlooked something very important and forgot what the master mater said of ""Be a spectator of your own game"" which I will point out during the end.  Forgetting that the Q move to d3.  Why so that if I take here he'd win my Q which is what happened.  One thing to note is that despite my average time per move being at least 10 hours I moved way too quickly here so I don't always go by average time per move as noted in the GK related forum.  However it's why I always emphasize to take your time and not move quickly.  Even when you think you know the best move you don't and what looks good might be bad so it's important to give yourself enough time to fully access the position.  I bring this up because in the WTWLTR easy19 said that I moved too quickly there.  Well for the most part I disagree with that assessment since I was voting on main lines but at this point that was the case. "

It's as important to pay attention which I overlooked which makes an oversight.  And that's why it was a blunder that shouldn't have been made.  So with best play from white the game is lost for black.  However I'm not giving up yet.  And I'm not going to make it easy for him to win for if I do he won't take me seriously again as it will come too easy for him which I don't want because it's not as good for learning purposes.  But @superandy: This is important to think about from the previous mistakes.  Best here was to exchange with 13...Qxb1.  Now imagine if I played this move instead.  What would have been outcome?  Well in order to avoid being a Q down in addition to what you've lost you would've had to take back with 14.Rxb1 which is that liquidation that you don't want since you'd be forced to exchange while down material.  So after taking back then I could play this a move later so 14...exf3 15.Bxf3 so in addition to what was lost and exchange you'd lose another piece.   Now that's something to think about because in general it's important to also assume as though you're opponent will find the best response in which case the opponent would have a winning advantage.

742,23,14,1Rad8,b'3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/1P4b1/P2QPp2/1B1P1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',But at this point however I do have a plan against white.  Will it work however?  That remains to be seen.  Keep in mind that white doesn't have to allow it.  What it boils down to is that since I'm now in a lot of trouble and a desperate this is where it pays to be really aggressive as opposed to getting nervous.  For if I get nervous then his advantage will grow and white will be able to win it without any problem.  He still should win but like I said earlier I'm not going to make it easy for him.

Played that many times against my friends when down a queen""  And It told him while repeating what I mentioned a few moves that it's good he realized that.  The idea is because of what happened earlier about looking and accessing the position.  In that I'm proud of him because what it shows is that he already learned something in this game.  But I also told him something important as well.  That is I almost overlooked another move now knowing how easy that is but this next move should be more then just that.  Meaning that in short it's a discovered attack but in the long run strategically this what I'm about to do is a little worse then a discovered.  Still he has a winning advantage but must be careful and can't become overly confident as we'll see later on."

746,23,18,1Rxd2,b'5rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4b3/1P4b1/P3PpP1/1B1r1P1P/RQ3RK1 w - -',But this was my actual since my fourteenth move.  The idea is that now he takes my B and when I take I've exchanged my B for his N.  Now it might not seem special and did learn that usually B's are worth more then N's in the long run.  But in this case a N is actually worth more.  It's not the same but somewhat similar to a position between GM's Petrosian and Spassky.  By exchanging there is a lot of damage my is about to cause especially when I capture on e5.
747,23,19,1Rd1,b'5rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4n3/1P4b1/P3PpP1/3r1P1P/RQ1R2K1 b - -',Correct.  With any other move it would take a while to realize the damage but I would launch a devastating with 18...Bh3.  It would be a while but after I attack and he pulls back my next move would be 19...Nd3 and if he took my N and I'd take my Q but if not I'd play 20...Rxf2 with the threat of 21...Rg2+ and because of the B on h3 no matter what he'd do mate would be unavoidable with either a discovered mate so 22...Rh2# or if 23.Rh1 23...Nxf2#  That's also why 14...Rad8 was more then just a discovered.  However white in my opinion found the best move to prevent this situation.  Therefore the only way for white to prevent mate would by giving up his R for my N so while he still have an edge some of my advantages however would have come back at this point.
748,23,20,1Re2,b'5rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4n3/1P4b1/P3PpP1/4rP1P/RQ1R2K1 w - -',Since I'm down material I refuse to allow liquidation an exchange without a good reason for doing.  In this position there's nothing that can black can get by doing that.
749,23,21,Bxh3,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1Pn5/P3PpPb/4rP2/RQ1R2K1 w - -',The idea was not to make up for lost material believe it or not.  There is another reason which is even better.  First the idea is to protect my B.  Now I could've retreated but the reason I didn't is because with this move my B is dangerous.  I'm already coming up with a strategy.  It will take a lot of moves but with the B there and then other pieces in that area things will start getting dangerous for white if he's not careful.  Not all of this is my goal meaning just mate in stuff.  However what I'm saying about having to be careful is what I wanted for teaching purposes.  The idea is that even though you're ahead and have extra material you still have to be careful because the idea isn't to relax but instead think about how you can keep your advantages.  Now letting your guard is what usually throws away people advantages and more often then not is how people go from having an advantage to a disadvantage.  And this is also why players are sometimes able to pull swindles.
750,23,22,Nxe3,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P1R4/P3npPb/4rP2/RQ4K1 w - -',The move looks bad as I just gave him something despite being behind.  However this was no blunder and there was a strategy behind this.  Something important to think about it.  
751,23,23,2fxe3,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P1R4/P3PpPb/4r3/RQ4K1 b - -',"?? Having said that this move is a blunder.  While it wasn't forced I figured however that he'd take it.  However the plan was to give up my N like this.  Why?  Before doing so my f pawn was effectively blocked by his f pawn.  By letting him have my N not only do I have a passed pawn but the f pawn is now extremely dangerous.  I'm not sure what the best move would've been but because of what he played with best play from both of us this is now a draw.  Before this move white had a winning advantage.  The idea here is that when one gives something away you must ask yourself and figure out if it was blundered or if there was a plan behind it.  If the opponent has something in mind then don't take as you don't have to.  A good example was in my game against Jack where like with easy19 I met my fate against.  I wound up blundering away material so I had to figure out something and this kind of thing has worked.  So I gave him a pawn knowing that if he took I'd be able to mate.  But this time he did not fall into that trap.  In it he said ""You're giving me a pawn.  I don't have to take that pawn.""  Instead he forced a Q exchange.  To note: my Q is how I would've mated had he taken my pawn instead.  After the unwanted liquidation there was no hope left for me as he got a passed pawn that proved to be a killer.  Well on a smaller scale the same thing applies here.  @superandy: As the saying goes ""To take is a mistake"".  Sometimes especially against stronger players who give things away be careful because they often give things with a plan behind it.  And if you're not aware of it it can and usually does spell trouble.  The other thing worth noting as I learned from GM JP is that sometimes tempii is more important then protecting or winning material.  By taking my N you gave me the time I needed to get this passed pawn.  And unlike before I'm not going to make anymore lucky so as the master mater puts it ...""brace yourself."""
752,23,24,2Rg2+,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P1R4/P3PpPb/6r1/RQ4K1 w - -',According to the post game analysis this is a blunder.  Instead better was to check on f2 so 23...f2+ with the idea that I'd promote and exchange.  And that way I'd compensate and now be ahead 4 points as opposed to 3 points down.  For that reason I did consider that move as I saw that to.  But having said that I absolutely disagree with this analysis only because there was a plan behind.  However it'll take about 10 moves or more which shows just how far ahead I was thinking.  The idea here is that white must be careful for if he isn't I will eventually be able to mate him.  Having said the idea is putting pressure on the K side.
753,23,25,Re2,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P1R4/P3PpPb/4r3/RQ5K w - -',The idea for me was to make room for my f pawn.  The idea but this is not what I was going to do per say as then you'd have cheapo tactics too obvious to drive.  But the idea was only to start formulating and looking for ways to threaten mate with my B R and f pawn.  Of course I know that my opponent doesn't have to allow so I'm figuring that if I even attempt he'll prevent find the best moves to get out of it only to find myself with problems.  So I'm not going to allow it but instead I'm just looking for opportunities and see what possible weaknesses he might have.
754,23,26,Bg2+,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P5R/P3PpP1/4r1b1/RQ5K w - -',Obviously putting pressure on his K and forcing him to figure which two places he'll put the K.
755,23,27,2Kg1,b'5rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/8/1P5R/P3PpP1/4r1b1/RQ4K1 b - -',Another option was 26.Kh2.  I'm not sure which is better I thought this was the right choice as otherwise it appeared that I'd be able to force a win.  But I studied and that isn't the case.  Either way this is a drawish position.  If both players find the right moves I envision that it will end in a draw either by stalemate or repetition.
756,23,28,2h6,b'5rk1/pp3pp1/2p4p/8/1P5R/P3PpP1/4r1b1/RQ4K1 w - -',This is a move that I very nearly overlooked.  Instead I wanted to play 26...Rd8?? immediately and very nearly made this blunder and overlooked what would've come.  But this time I remembered the easy19's advice about being your own spectator so I looked at everything only to realize that if play 26...Rd8 he'll mate with 27.Qxh2#  Now as noted earlier this is something that I won't allow for if I do he won't take me seriously or listen to me again.  Therefore I still want him to be able to learn so I can't make this mistake.
757,23,29,2Rg4,b'5rk1/pp3pp1/2p4p/8/1P4R1/P3PpP1/4r1b1/RQ4K1 b - -',?? A serious blunder.  And with it I now have the advantage.  He was worried about me winning his R with 27...g5 but best was 27.Rd4 as that would prevent me from playing 27...Rd8?? as noted earlier.  For now if I do so he has the immediate 28.Rxd8  But with this move I either double on d2 but in order to prevent it he'd be forced to give up his d R without compensation.  So no matter how you slice it the advantage is handed back to me as I will compensate.
758,23,30,2Qb3,b'3r2k1/pp3pp1/2p4p/8/1P4R1/PQ2PpP1/4r1b1/R5K1 b - -',?? The losing blunder.  However it doesn't lose right away.  But with this choice sooner or later the game falls apart for white.  In this position the only choice was to give up his R by playing 28.Rd4 as I was alluding to earlier.  The idea is that with this move I'm now able to and take advantage of the opportunity to double up here.  And all afterwards once I play 29...Bh3 mate will become unstoppable sooner or later.  @superandy: The idea is that you can't allow your opponent to double up right near the home square.  Once this happens especially when I have another piece like the bishop nearby pieces are well coordinated so it generally leads to inevitable mating sequences.  
759,23,31,3Qxf7+,b'6k1/pp3Qp1/2p4p/8/1P3R2/P3PpPb/3rr3/R5K1 b - -',Understandable that he wanted to check but it doesn't do much because I can and will get out of danger.  And if 30...Kg8 instead 31.f8 and I can still get out with 31...Kh7 so to save time I'll play ...Kh7 right away.  While it wouldn't matter much my idea is to teach and help white remember the importance of tempii and how much you really need it because wasting it can sometimes mean disaster as is the case here.  And the idea is to set a good example for him.
760,23,32,3Rxf3,b'8/pp3Qpk/2p4p/8/1P6/P3PRPb/3rr3/R5K1 b - -',Ok remember when I said that 28.Qb3?? was the losing blunder.  Well this time the move played instantly loses.  I figured that he'd take this pawn.  Why not whites ahead and so taking would generally increase.  But remember that sometimes taking is a bad idea.  Unlike the last time this time the capture instantly leads to an inevitable sequence as we're about to see which one way or another I was not going to overlook.  @superandy: So as noted always ask yourself why I gave something away because as was the case with 22...Nxe3 this is not a blunder for the reason that I outlined.
761,23,33,3Kh1,b'8/pp3Qpk/2p4p/8/1P6/P3PRPb/3r2r1/R6K b - -',32.Kf1 was his only other option.  However it's still mate.  Why?  After that comes 32...Rh2+  Now if 33.Ke1 I instantly mate with 33...Rhe2#  Or he can play 33.Kg1 but then comes 33...Rdg2+ 34.Kf1 (forced) Rh1#.  
762,23,34,Rh1#,b'8/pp3Qpk/2p4p/8/1P6/P3PRPb/6r1/R4K1r w - -',"As I shortly pm'd superandy afterwards white played respectively north of his rating.  If I were to evaluate I'd say more like a 1200 rated player.  The morals still are as he can learn from my mistakes.  Meaning: That between his and my mitstakes there are a few lessons that can be learned.  First ""Be a spectator of your game.""  For example after white made mistake that lost a piece and he then made another that allowed me to take another piece but I made one by overlooking that my Q was left en-prise and by doing so he won it.  With best play from superandy the game would've been lost for black.  And it's also the fact that when he threatened mate with his R and Q which I nearly overlooked I figured out what happened by looking at the entire board and not allowing him to mate me.  Second while it's good to follow guidelines sometimes one must break them if it'll cause you problems like the loss of material.  The is principles are just guidelines as opposed to rules.  Third ""To take is a mistake"".  Sometimes you evaluate and figure if giving away something was a blunder or there was a strategy underlying.  Henceforth the saying unless there is a tactic.  Like here when I gave up my N and a P the idea was to give myself the time needed to come up with a devastating.  And one thing to note is that this where tempo becomes more important material.  Last but not least ""When you think that you have won or are in a winning position be very careful and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise you might start making mistakes and losing the game""  So when you're ahead and think that you're gonna win no matter what you always think it through and figure what your opponent is capable of doing.  Instead of relaxing or getting super confident it's better to still spend the time studying the position so that the opponent does not have time to make that move.  @superandy: If you can remember these lessons I'm confident that you're rating will sorely up 1200 before you know quickly.  I can see this potential in you because of how well you've played and how serious of a player you really are."

So in order to pull that victory as he noted I had to think like a GM.  And it was the first time in history where I did not make any mistakes against a much stronger player let alone Mr. Stockel.  However there is still a lot to learn with this defense and when I play it against my coach I often tend to blunder early.  This unfortunately was no exception.

766,24,3,Bxf6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bB2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',?! In my past games with Jack Stockel in postions like this where a N is pinned I generally exchange.  However it is a slight inaccuracy because Masters and GM's don't play this.  And my coach advised me to play things that masters and gm's analyze.  This is why he also told me not to play the Dunst opening.  In the past I did this with the same idea as the Ruy Lopez and a couple of occasions it actually transposed into that.  But the reason they don't analyze it as much is that unlike the standard 1.e4 openings it's known to put compromises on the center.  With that best was 6.Nf3! and that's something that I did consider.  In fact there were two choices for candidate what I narrowed to be the two best choices.  One was this 6.Nf3 and the other was this move.  Of these two I thought that best was the move played but it actually would've been the other candidate that I almost chose.  BTW the computer analysis proves that this is inaccurate because of what's about to happen.
767,24,4,Qxf6,b'rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/4bq2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',With that slight inaccuracy black now has a small advantage.

In ""The Deeper Chess Theory Club"" I learned that one way to control the center is by attacking it from wrecking_ball in ""The Snap Shot Analysis"" thread.  So I was trying to apply the same concept and strategy here as that's also a part of theory.  The problem here is that this is another inaccuracy and with it black's advantages are increasing."

771,24,8,1Ne2,b'2kr3r/pp1n1ppp/2pbbq2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2QR1K1 b - -',I don't like having to cram my N like this.  But in this position there is no choice.  Afterall this move was difficult to find. I saw his intention.  The strategy here is to win my pawn pin my f N or get a half pin on my c N and I could not allow that. If he didn't have that plan I wouldn't have used my N as a shield.  But this is an example of the consequences affiliated with my last inaccuracies.

My whole idea here was to prevent him from winning my N  I figured that here he could not play ...g4 as I'd just take.  However in this position he can and will play ...h6 establishing the connected pawns henceforth pawn structures and be able to do damage.  Eventually this will enable him material no matter what I do.  The only option here was 12.Nd2 to prevent any further damage.  I don't like it because it really jams in the N and crams the Q.  But it's better then what black does next.

I figured that all I have to was exchange to get out of this situation since I figured that the his most dangerous pawn was on g4.  However this unleashes a whole can of worms as they say as it's just the beginning of my problems.  As it turns out and according to the analysis which is absolutely correct this is an outright blunder.  The reason being is that because of what black does next which is listed as a mainline in the analysis I'll have to lose a piece or get mated quickly.  Either way black is now clearly winning and almost has a won game.
776,24,13,1Kxh2,b'2kr3r/pp1n1p2/2p1bq2/3p3p/3P2P1/3B4/PPP1NPPK/R2QR3 b - -',?? I had two choices.  This was one of them.  And the interesting thing is that with this move I regained all of my confidence back given that I was behind and going for anything.  However while I was lost with my last move this instantly loses.  I figured that all I had to do was take back and by doing so I'm no longer nervous at this point.  In fact I felt here that with best play I had a shot at getting a draw.  And I'm now out of good moves.  Having said that the only other option was 15.Kh1! and that would've prolonged the game.  Yes I would be a piece behind but there would be no immediate sequence against me.  With this move however I have to lose something worth more or get mated.
777,24,14,1Kg3,b'2kr3r/pp1n1p2/2p1bq2/3p4/3P2p1/3B2K1/PPP1NPP1/R2QR3 b - -',?? I don't know what the best move was but with this move it's over now.  That's because at this point black now has an inevitable mate in 3 with no way out of it.
778,24,15,Qf6#,b'2kr3r/pp1n1p2/2p1bq2/3p2K1/3P2p1/3B4/PPP1N1P1/R2QR3 w - -',One thing I did learn however and it's a good thing.  Remember when I said that one should not become overlyconfident if you're winning.  Well this especially applies when your opponent has the advantage.  Once he had a winning advantage only shortly then did my confidence grow.  In fact I got overlyconfident and that's why I took the bishop.  Well I did use analyze the board to determine if it was good or not why and what makes it good or bad.  So I did evaluate the position figuring that no matter what he plays there was nothing he could do to mate me as I remembered from the master mater when I took and did not even study to see if there was a threat affiliated with it.  But here I did and discovered the threat I missed.  Therefore when you're at a disadvantage especially against a stronger player instead of being aggressive this is where one must be more defensive and really spend more time analyzing the position.  And usually if you blunder or make a inaccuracy there is a way around it.  But when you're up against a much stronger that is at expert level or higher one flaw will generally make or break a game.  So the idea is don't do something that will get you in trouble in the first place.  BTW I would like to thank geniusacamel for giving me this game.

With lots of pawns on the board the answer is generally ""no"" so you better don't. I took the risk here because I planned to get all my forces on f7 pressuring black and I had the ""escape square"" b4 threatening the black queen and thus winning a tempo to save the rook againt future pawn's advances. My other plan was to take away the queen so to play f4 (once e3 was well guarded). But again this is a ""passive"" plan that gives black tempo to c5 and d4. "

As often in tactic chess the crossed-attacks theme is most interesting but you have to be very realistic in tempo calculations. Note that black has Qa1+ followed by QxRg1. But white's threat is worse that this. Black could simply play Re7. It deverted the R from the attack but now if white goes Nxe6 black has Rxf2 while the dsb guards some squares around the king. Bue even more than that: black has to prevent the white R to join the attack so d4 was mandatory even sacrifying it in order to keep this rook apart from the attack (then black can try to win it with Bd6... after the kingside storm).

The queen would do a fine job protecting that knight and if white did not move his own queen (instead of taking the rook) black could trade Ne4 for the white queen with Ng5+.  (discovered check by the black queen).  If white interposes the queen she falls to the kick of the black horse (Nxe3) or Qe4 (worse) Qe7xQe4+ for free.  Then black gets to move the rook.
834,26,6,c4,b'rnbk3r/ppp4p/6p1/3p4/2P1n3/5Q2/PP1PKbPP/RNB2B1R b - -',Ok I like Pd3 better.  That way if black does not move the knight white picks it off with the pawn.  If black DOES move the knight QxBf2 or KxBf2.  Either way black sheds a knight or bishop.  Black might respond with Re8 to protect the knight but that is faint help when a pawn's lance is thrusting into the mighty steed.  Horse heart makes a fine addition to polish sausage.
835,26,7,dxc4,b'rnbk3r/ppp4p/6p1/8/2p1n3/5Q2/PP1PKbPP/RNB2B1R w - -',Here black must be hoping white accepts the QxN sacrifice.
836,26,8,1Qxe4,b'rnbk3r/ppp4p/6p1/8/2p1Q3/8/PP1PKbPP/RNB2B1R b - -',Ok no.  No no no no no!  Re8 pins the queen.  Oh the humanity!  I cannot bear to watch.  Of course black trades a rook for the white queen and loses the bishop besides.  So although this is a terrible move white still enjoys material advantage.  Plus a rook and bishop are almost worth a queen (eight points versus nine).
837,26,9,1Rf8,b'rnbk1r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2p1Q3/8/PP1PKbPP/RNB2B1R w - -',?  Re8 pins the white queen.  Here white really should move Qd5+ to prevent black from seizing the precarious queen.
838,26,10,1Nc3,b'rnbk1r2/ppp4p/6p1/8/2p1Q3/2N5/PP1PKbPP/R1B2B1R b - -',No.  If you don't like Qd5+ to see if black would be foolish enough to interpose Bd7 (12. QxPb7 and black's a rook bites the dust) then QxPc4 seems nice.  Then Pd unleashes the black bishop.  Pb3 isn't all that bad either--once the queen has been placed out of harm's way.

841,26,13,1Nf6,b'r1bk1r2/p1p4p/5np1/1p6/4Q3/2N5/PP2KbPP/R1B2B1R w - -',So black chooses to ignore QxRa8.

843,26,15,Re8,b'Q1bkr3/p1p4p/6p1/1p6/4N3/8/PP2KbPP/R1B2B1R w - -',Here white likes Bg5+.  This lets Ra dog out.

846,26,18,1Re8,b'Q1bkr3/p1p4p/6p1/1p6/4N3/8/PP4PP/R1B1KB1R w - -',See?  Knight can't move now.  Bg5+ still looks real good and lets the left rook loose.
847,26,19,1Bxb5,b'Q1bkr3/p1p4p/6p1/1B6/4N3/8/PP4PP/R1B1K2R b - -',This move is good it should be followed by Qc6.  With a 20 point lead the king deserves special consideration.
848,26,20,2Bf4,b'Q1bk4/p1p4p/6p1/1B2r3/4NB2/8/PP4PP/R3K2R b - -',Nope.  Bg5+ forces a bishop/rook exchange withe either RxBg5 or Re7 BxR KxB (QxB so the first move is better for black).  This move sacrifices the white bishop for nothing.  
849,26,21,2Rxb5,b'Q1bk4/p1p4p/6p1/1r6/4NB2/8/PP4PP/R3K2R w - -',O-O-O+ would be fun just because but is illegal now that the king moved.

Congratulations Rick! You started this game with the most popular Master move (as per the GameKnot World Database)!

This move is good because it opens lines for the LSB (light squared bishop) and the queen. More important you control the crucial d5 square and the secondary f5 square. In the opening you have a constant battle to control the primary center squares being d4 d5 e4 and e5. Whether you control them with pawns (as you are doing with your first move 1.e4) or you control them with pieces (as I do with my first move 1...Nc6) you must battle to control these squares!

Also to a lesser degree the same principle goes for the secondary center squares being c3 c4 c5 c6 d3 d6 e3 e6 f3 f4 f5 and f6. Bottom line Rick to play well in the opening you must be a control freak. Control those squares!"
855,27,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"So 1...Nc6 marks the Nimzowitsch Defence.

Though it is not currently used in top level chess it is a great weapon to use in intermediate level games. Wikipedia states ""This opening is an example of a hypermodern opening where Black invites White to occupy the centre of the board at an early stage with pawns. Black's intent is to block or otherwise restrain White's central pawns and if allowed to do so by inaccurate play by White eventually undermine the White pawn centre by well-timed pawn advances of his own or by attacking the White pieces defending the centre."" See reference in comment below.
I like this defence because it is not as studied by my opponents as more popular openings.
***************************************************************************

The Nimzowitsch Defence is categorized as a Semi-Open Game. That is ""...a chess opening in which White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5. The Semi-Open Games are also called Single King Pawn Asymmetrical King Pawn or Half-Open Games (or Openings) and are the complement of the Open Games or Double King Pawn Games which begin 1.e4 e5."

*************************************************************************** 
So on a master level this is the most common move. *************************************************************************** 
It seems to me to be an attempt to go into an open opening such as Ruy Lopez or Giocco Piano. If Black plays 2...e5 (considered by many to be the best move) now white can play the Ruy with 3.b5 or the Piano with 3.c4. I won't allow that though since my reason for my previous moves is that I like the Nimzowich. And so...."

I request feedback from all of the Immortal Kings (and others who see this annotation) especially advanced players. This move is an experiment on my part. Gameknot's computer analysis states it is an mistake. GK's World Database does not show it at all.

So I am sacrificing a pawn to gain momentum in the center and gaining space and development. After 4...e5 5.dxc7 Qxc7 I threaten e4! His knight has few squares to move to. He can play 6.d3 to stop the e-pawn advance but that leaves him with back wards development and a temporarily blocked in Bishop."

*************************************************************************** 
I take back! So Rick consider this position.
*************************************************************************** 
I stated previously ""In the opening you have a constant battle to control the primary center squares being d4 d5 e4 and e5."" You also have a constant battle to gain development. This means you need to get your pieces out as quickly as you can and preferably before your opponent. An army in it's original position(s) can neither defend no attack. Take a look at the final position. You finished with a bishop knight and rook on their original squares. You lacked development thus you could not ward off my attack. I was even able to give up material (15...Nxf3) because my remaining material was sufficient due to your lack of development.
*************************************************************************** 
There are several ways to ensure your development is good:
1. Try to avoid moving the same piece repeatedly until you complete your development. Your development is complete when you have your knights bishops and queen off the back rank and you have castled so your rooks are connected.
2. Make threats against your opponent. When I played 7...e4 attacking your knight you may have wanted to play 6.Nc3 (a good developing move) but you couldn't because of my threat to take your f3 knight. You could have played 8.Re1 furthering your development as my pawn would be pinned. Instead you moved your king side knight a second time slowing down your development.
3.Check your opponent's king with a developing move. When I played 11...Bc5+ you could not develop your knight to c3 for example since you were required to move your king.
*************************************************************************** 
There are times it is okay to disregard this principle along with all the principles of the game. This is when you have very forceful threats which your opponent can't counter effectively. For example why think about development if you have a forced mate in 3 moves? "

*************************************************************************** 
The move I've been waiting for. Now you will need to move the knight a 2nd time losing development. I am also setting a trap with this move: 8.Ng5 h6 9.Nf7 Rh7 and the knight is trapped. I would then harass the defending bishop with 10...Na5 11.Qe2 Nxc4 12.Qxc4 Qxf7. Or you may try 8.Ng5 h6 9.Bf7+ Ke7 leaving you with 2 attacked pieces and 1 of them will die.

No he did not fall for it! Yet now if you count your development moves you only have 4 moves (castling counts as 2) while I have 6. So I am 2 moves ahead in development. Since white gets to go 1st you started out a half move ahead of me. But moving your knight 3 times (2.Nf3 8.Ng5 and 9.Nh3) put you behind in development. In addition you now have the knight on h3. The knights are not good on the side of the board as they have control of less squares. A white knight on f3 or c3 (f6 or c6 respectively for black knights) has control of 8 squares including 2 of the primary central squares I mentioned earlier. A white knight on h3 or a3 (h6 or a6 for black) has control of 4 squares none of which are the primary central squares.
*************************************************************************** 
Note also this is only your 9th move and you moved that knight 3 times. That means 33.33% of your moves were made by the one knight. That's seldom good."

Black however has a structural advantage in that he has an extra central pawn  white gains him a long-term advantage of taking control of the centre. A typical imbalance has arisen. From here white should use his development advantage in order to secure an early initiative. If White plays passively or his initiative runs out of steamthen typically its blackwith the better pawn structure who has the long-term chances. If black equalise he is already better. This structural advantage is seen in most Open Sicilian Lines for example the dragon the najdorf and scheveningen variations. The major exception to this rule is the Sveshnikov variation in which black accepts pawn weaknesses for activity.

The stage is set for another uncompromising battle between the two sides. White will develop with Qd2 and 0-0-0 and if allowed will push forward on the kingside with g4-g5. Black may forestall this advance with the defensive move ...h7-h6 or be ready to move his knight to either h5 or d7 (once the other knight has vacated this square.) If the f6-knight is forced to move elsewhere (g8 for example then this is usually a sign that things have gone wrong for black. Once again black's counterplay lies very much on the queenside. Often the fight is over the d5 square black plays the pawn lunge ...b5-b4. This asks the question of the knight on c3 which will either jump into d5 or retreat elsewhere. Black will find it difficult to arrange the freeing advance ...d6-d5 but if white is carless enough to allow this then often this turns out to be favourable for black. In general play is sharp and dynamic often involving positional or tactical sacifice from both sides

Now the game is won for black but it is still of some interest to see HOW I win it because to have the advantage is not enough if you don't know how to exploit it. 
1065,34,37,2Qxd1,b'6k1/2q2ppp/p1p1b3/8/1P6/P4P1P/6P1/3Q3K b - -',Black can easily fall on a back rank mate but hey I'm not a novice! :-)
1066,34,38,2g6,b'6k1/2q2p1p/p1p1b1p1/8/1P6/P4P1P/6P1/3Q3K w - -',I regarded as a priority to avoid the back rank mate threat that means to free my queen to move away. True it leave holes on the black squares ok but on the other side if I played h6 I would have left the white diagonal undefended since Bf5 is unsupported. In order to win this game I have to exchange the queens and all the pawns I can. If I get a passer on a or c I'll win for sure. Because see: the other threat I can build is based on Qg3-f2 or g5 and Bf1. This will threat mate. Now can black reach this position without leaving white 1) possibility to defend g2 with the Q on the second row and 2) without letting her snatch some pawns in the process? No case. 
1067,34,39,2a4,b'6k1/2q2p1p/p1p1b1p1/8/PP6/5P1P/6P1/3Q3K b - -',That's ok... what else can white do?
1068,34,40,2Kg7,b'8/2q2pkp/p1p1b1p1/8/PP6/5P1P/6P1/3Q3K w - -',...inviting once for all...
1069,34,41,f6,b'8/2q3kp/p1p1bpp1/8/PP1Q4/5P1P/6P1/7K w - -',I can afford g4 and this will leave f3 as a target. 
1070,34,42,3Qc5,b'8/2q3kp/p1p1bpp1/2Q5/PP6/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',White wisely didn't go for it. He was playing really well except for the Q move. 
1071,34,43,3Kf7,b'8/2q2k1p/p1p1bpp1/2Q5/PP6/5P1P/6P1/7K w - -',? Making again my queen free to move away with the king controlling e7 and f8 but overlooking the simple...
1072,34,44,3axb5,b'8/2q2k1p/2p1bpp1/1PQ5/8/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',My pawn is pinned to the queen. I'm very ashamed. Now I have to get out of a second real trouble. My compliments to white!
1073,34,45,3b6,b'8/2q2k1p/1Pp2pp1/2Qb4/8/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',White sees that with bxc6 QxC6 the game will lose any interest. And we play blitz to enjoy. So white choosed for a desperate move hoping to surprise me. And I could well have lost my nerves... could I lose or draw this? Now now now... let's se... wonderful. Caissa didn't betrayed me. White has no pawn to threat the bishop and all I must care is that he can't queen. He will have to play Qa7 to threaten me and I must exchange by force and then the promotion square will be white and I will have the tempo to play d5 defending it. White played well but with correct play from my part he is doomed. 
1074,34,46,3Qb7,b'8/1q3k1p/1Pp2pp1/2Qb4/8/5P1P/6P1/7K w - -',No check's round here due to my previous Kf7 (it deserves a restrospective !)
1075,34,47,3Qa5,b'8/1q3k1p/1Pp2pp1/Q2b4/8/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',White goes for it. After the exchange I will have to lose a lot of tempoes taking the pawn with the king but guess what: I have a passer. 
1076,34,48,3Ke7,b'8/1q2k2p/1Pp2pp1/Q2b4/8/5P1P/6P1/7K w - -',? White could have gone for a check's round here causing me another think about how to force his threat Qa8!
1077,34,49,3Qa7,b'8/Qq2k2p/1Pp2pp1/3b4/8/5P1P/6P1/7K b - -',White spares me. He probably thinks that he can take some revenge with his king while I am going to and from the pawn. 
1078,34,50,3Kg1,b'8/P3k2p/5pp1/2pb4/8/5P1P/6P1/6K1 b - -',...but look: it is not easy for the white king to reach some target! I have the tempo I need to go for the pawn. And mine will win the game. 
1079,34,51,4gxf5,b'8/7p/2k2p2/2pb1P2/7P/4K3/8/8 b - -',The pawns are blocked. On a black square true but the white king will fall to the c pawn sooner. 
1080,34,52,4Kb5,b'8/7p/5p2/1kpb1P2/7P/4K3/8/8 w - -',My opponent sensibly resigned. A very enjoyable game where he made me sweep a lot to win. The win is not always the good meter for a good player.

1108,36,19,1Bf3,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/5B2/PP3q1P/2KR2NR b kq -',So I block the queen's retreat. Believe it or not this has all been seen before and I reached this position with white having been following the opening databases on Gameknot. This position is roughly equal. Although white is 3 pawns down it is hard for black to complete his development.
1109,36,20,1Qe3+,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/4qB2/PP5P/2KR2NR w kq -',With this check I am taken out of the opening databases.

Maybe I play h4 protecting it maybe he then drives it back with h6. I basically losing. But the queen's hunger is the undoing of the black position.
1117,36,28,1Qe2,b'r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/6N1/1BP5/8/PP2q2P/K2R3R w kq -',He targets the c4 pawn. I looked carefully at Rh-e1 here and then after he moves the queen sacrificing with either rook or knight on e6 but they don't seem to work so I decide to target another weakness.

If the f pawn moves then I can play Rf1-e1 and take on e6 after he moves his queen. I think best is to return some of the sacrificed material with Qh5 and sacrificing queen and pawn for rook and knight when I take on f7. He would then still be materially up but his backward development and my actve pieces give me the better position for example Qh5 17.	Rxf7	Qxf7 18. Nxf7 Kxf7 19.	Rf1+	Ngf6 20. Qe7+ Kg8 21.	Qxe6#

1168,38,19,1d3,b'3r1rk1/p1pnbppn/7q/4p3/2B4P/2NP1Q2/PPP2P2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',Now i played this because i gained another tempo. White stands better here. Blacks pieces are all quite passive.
1169,38,20,Qf6,b'3r1rk1/p1pnbppn/5q2/4p2P/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2P2/R1B1K2R w KQ -',Whites attack is getting dangerous but he hasn't castled. Will the king in the center backfire?
1170,38,21,1Qg3,b'3r1rk1/p1pnbppn/5q2/4p2P/2B5/2NP2Q1/PPP2P2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',White avoids the queen exchange. The queen is now looking at g7.
1171,38,22,1Nd5,b'3r1rk1/p1pn1ppn/3b1q2/3Np2P/2B5/3P2Q1/PPP2P2/R1B1K2R b KQ -',And again white gains a tempo.

1176,38,27,2Ne7+,b'3r1rk1/p1pnN2n/3b2pB/4p3/2B5/3P4/PPP2P2/R3K2R b KQ -',Ne7+ its a double check which drives the king to h1.
1177,38,28,2Nxg6#,b'3r1r1k/p1pn3n/3b2NB/4p3/2B5/3P4/PPP2P2/R3K2R b KQ -',And a beatiful mate for the finish. Blacks pieces are working well together to stop the black king and this was made possible by numerous tempo gains.
1178,39,0,Be3,b'rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/4B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',White deviates from the more common 6.h4... which means he pressures development.
1179,39,1,Bd3,b'r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2nb1/8/3P4/3BBNN1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',White's development now surpasses my own but a trade of bishops on d3 only enhances this advantage. My bishop shall remain on g6.
1180,39,2,Bd6,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/3BBNN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',If White decides to trade bishops on g6 I will recapture with my h-pawn and my h8-rook will have an open file to shoot down increasing his activity. Also my d6-square may be weak but at least I'm using it to pressure my opponent by placing a bishop on it.
1181,39,3,Qc7,b'r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpnb1/6B1/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Notw how heavy pressure on h2 is now increasing.
1182,39,4,Nxf6,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I decide that a better placed piece triumphs over a robust centre (something which would be provided if I had recaptured with 11...gxf6)
1183,39,5,1Ne2,b'r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White dangerously uncovers h2 for my diagonal battery. However if his next move is 13.g3...  then he is safeguarding his position. Furthermore he could be aiming at 13.c4... followed by 14.Nc3... for improved position. Another possibility is that he's simply defending the f4-square vulnerable to my Ne5-f4.
1184,39,6,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/ppq2ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',I can now try to focus an attack on the White king.
1185,39,7,Nd5,b'2kr3r/ppq2ppp/2pbp1b1/3n4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',My plan is to manoeuvre the knight to f4. If bishops are swapped on g6 I open up the h-file voluntarily. If we trade knights on f4 I will try to swap bishops on d3 and then advance my f g and h-pawns towards the enemy king.
1186,39,8,1g3,b'2kr3r/ppq2ppp/2pbp1b1/3n4/3P4/2PB1NP1/PP2NP1P/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White defies me!

1188,39,10,Qe7,b'2kr3r/pp2q1pp/2pbp1b1/3n1pN1/3P4/2PB2P1/PP2NP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - -',One possible variation is 16. Nf4?! Qxg5 17. Nxe6 Qe7 18. Nxd8 Rxd8
1189,39,11,1Nh3,b'2kr3r/pp2q1p1/2pbp1bp/3n1p2/3P4/2PB2PN/PP2NP1P/R1Q2RK1 b - -',A pawn advance is now near. White's last move builds greatly against f4. However the move isn't dangerous and f3 is now very weak - ready to be exploited.
1190,39,12,1b4,b'2kr3r/pp2q1p1/2pbp2p/3n1p1b/1P1P4/2PB2PN/P3NP1P/R1Q2RK1 b - b3',White decides to stump my a3-f8 diagonal battery but also shows possible intentions to march at my king with his queenside.
1191,39,13,1Bf3,b'2kr3r/pp2q1p1/2pbp2p/3n1p2/1P1P4/2PB1bPN/P3NP1P/R1Q2RK1 w - -',I dominate the kingside light-coloured squares. I also have control over the a8-h1 diagonal. Now I must secure f4 safely. However you also see how my f3-bishop prevents 19.f4!... which would complicate my stance.
1192,39,14,Qf6,b'2kr3r/pp4p1/2pbpq1p/3n1p2/1P1P1N2/2PB1bP1/P3NP1P/R1Q2RK1 w - -',If the premature 19...g5? then 20. Ng6... +/-. Nonetheless that variation is playable but risky - and with the advantage White would gain - damaging to Black's dominance on the kingside.
1193,39,15,exd5,b'2kr3r/pp4p1/2pb1q1p/3p1p2/1P1P4/2PB1bP1/P3NP1P/R1Q2RK1 w - -',20...cxd5 would potentially allow 21. Bb5... Also e4 is now secure and an open file for my rooks has appeared.
1194,39,16,2Qe3,b'2kr3r/pp4p1/2pb1q1p/3p1p2/1P1P4/2PBQbP1/P3NP1P/R4RK1 b - -',White moves in with tempo.

1196,39,18,fxe4,b'2kr3r/pp4p1/2pb1q1p/3p4/1P1Pp3/2P1Q1P1/P3NP1P/R4RK1 w - -',It can be seen how I have essentially moved the f-pawn to the d-file. Also an advance of my g+h pawns would suffocate White's counterplay. The only downside is the sudden passive nature of my d6-bishop.
1197,39,19,gxf6,b'2kr4/pp6/2pb1p1p/8/1P1Pp3/2P3P1/P3N2P/R5K1 w - -',Whilst I have developed a passed pawn the price of this is the isolated h-pawn. However he can stave off both opposing pawns.
1198,39,20,2a3,b'5r2/pp1k4/2pb1p1p/8/1P1Pp3/P1P3P1/4NK1P/5R2 b - -',White dominates the dark-coloured squares limiting my bishop. This is an advantage for White whose knight can hop into my own half should he chose. White's last move allows his previously anchored c-pawn to advance further should he wish to limit my queenside.
1199,39,21,3Nf4+,b'5r2/pp6/2pbk2p/5p2/1P1PpN2/P1P1K1P1/7P/5R2 b - -',This allows me to exchange my passive piece for his which is much more active.

1201,39,23,Kd5,b'5r2/pp6/2p4p/3k1p2/1P1PpK2/P1P3P1/7P/5R2 w - -',Now either king has the potential to invade the other side and it is possible for both to achieve this.
1202,39,24,Rf3+,b'8/pp6/2p4p/3k4/1P1Pp1P1/P1P1Kr2/8/7R w - -',An unbalanced position leaves me with a very slight edge.
1203,39,25,Rg3,b'8/pp6/2p4p/3k4/1P1Pp1P1/P1P3r1/4K3/7R w - -',An opposing passed pawn must not be created.
1204,39,26,4Rh5+,b'8/pp6/2p4p/3k3R/1P1Pp1P1/P1P3r1/4K3/8 b - -',(?) White squanders his move which in affect allows me to gain a move. 
1205,39,27,Rd3,b'8/pp6/7p/1pR5/3Pp1P1/PkPr4/5K2/8 w - -',If 43...Rxc3? then 44. Rxc3+ Kxc3 45. d5... 1-0 If 43...Rxg4 the White king would dangerously rejoin his pieces.
1206,39,28,4Rd7+,b'8/p2R4/7p/8/3kp1P1/P2r4/5K2/8 b - -',I only have flank pawns remaining which allow a future win meaning a draw is still possible.
1207,39,29,Ke1,b'8/8/3R3p/8/5rP1/8/4p1K1/4k3 w - -',(?) I fail to make the most of the position. If I had been patient I would not hide behind the pawn and instead played 54...Kc3 - forcing eventually to make the enemy rook move allowing me to promote on e1. I have squandered a win.
1208,39,30,6Kxg7,b'8/6K1/8/8/8/8/4k3/8 b - -',Solid play from both sides led to a drawn endgame. However White made an error by gifting me an advance into his half of the board with my king when he played 40. Rh5+?... However I replied with an error of my own on move 54 with 54... Ke1 and gifted a draw to White.
