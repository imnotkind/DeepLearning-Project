Back then I was rated 1504 (I had completed only 26 games on GameKnot at that time) and my opponent was rated 1490. Our first game ended on 2/24/09 and is annotated titled Aggressive Plans on that date. It's a short little gem that ends on move 26 after white walks black's king over to whites side of the board for a checkmate. White begins this game with the queen's pawn and I reply Indian.

Black is leaving his rook en prise and white can capture it with check gaining a tempo. That's usually certain doom but oddly enough in this case even that extra tempo won't let the white queen return to defense in time as she has to run around the forest of black pawns. There is always the fear of perpetual check and 3-move repetitions but nothing of that sort presents itself to white either so it's time for the poor rook to take one for the team.

Rxb3 Qxb3 and now black still has two attackers on the a3 pawn and will win two pawns instead of one. White chose to resign at this point. I asked him why since being just one pawn down in an otherwise equal middlegame is usually not cause for resignation and he replied that he didn't think he could hold either pawn and would end up two pawns down facing a black passed pawn and with all black pieces attacking. In any case it was short and sweet.

99,6,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',White goes with the Open Sicilian and black responds with the Classical line.
100,6,2,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',The book recommends 6. Bg5 (Richter-Rauzer Attack) or 6. Bc4 (Main Line of the Classical Variation). White chose a 6th move that isn't in my short little book. Back to the DB I go...
101,6,3,Bg7,b'r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/1B1N4/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Kind of an odd way to get to the Dragon.
102,6,4,Rb8,b'1r1qk2r/p2bpp1p/2pp1bp1/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k -',After the exchanges in the center black seizes the half-open file with his rook.

104,6,6,d5,b'1rq2rk1/p2bpp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2B1P3/1PP2P2/PR4PP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Something must be done to break up the center.

106,6,8,Qxc4,b'3r2k1/p3pp1p/6p1/8/2q5/2P2P2/PQ4PP/5RK1 w - -',OK all back to even steven but black's pawn structure seems a little better. Still white does have that passed pawn.

109,6,11,Qe3+,b'Q7/5pkp/4p1p1/8/5P2/2P1q2P/P2r2P1/2R3K1 w - -',Now white was the one being sneaky defending g2 from afar but now he loses two pawns.

112,6,14,f6,b'8/6kp/4ppp1/8/5P2/2q4P/5QPK/8 w - -',And there it is black's big blunder. 34. ... f6? was a mistake that guarantees a draw. Consolodating the queen inching the pawns forward looking for queen exhantes trying to create a passed pawn trying not to let white get in front of it and hold onto a draw - that's what black should have done. Instead I did this...
113,6,15,Kh6,b'8/Q6p/4pppk/8/5P2/2q4P/6PK/8 w - -',Only one place to go that doesn't offer white a draw by perpetual check.

115,6,17,Kxg5,b'8/4Q2p/4pp2/6k1/8/2q4P/6PK/8 w - -',Black has two pawns hanging which one will white kill?
116,6,18,Qe5+,b'8/7p/4Qp2/4q1k1/8/7P/6PK/8 w - -',I think white might have made the wrong decision. Taking the pawn at h7 gives white a passed pawn. Maybe he can find a way to promote maybe not but after capturing at h7 black will be playing for a draw. But by capturing at e6 now black is the one who will get a passed pawn and it will be white playing for a draw. Either way both lines would likely be draws but it seems better to put your opponent on the defensive rather than the other way around. Black forces the queen exchange and gains his passed pawn.
117,6,19,fxe5,b'8/7p/8/4p1k1/8/7P/6PK/8 w - -',This game is a dead draw unless one of the players has no idea how to play engames.
118,6,20,e4,b'8/7p/8/6k1/4p3/6KP/6P1/8 w - -',I could have offered a draw here or either of the previous two moves but I wanted my opponent to show me he could handle himself in an endgame first. Obviously white wants to get in front of the black pawn on e4 and if he does so then we have a draw. But if he backs off to h2 an obvious mistake then black wins. So I give white the rope to see if he'll hang himself.
119,6,21,Ke5,b'8/7p/8/4k3/4p2P/8/5KP1/8 w - -',"Just a bit more rope. If white carelessly plays 43. Kg3??? a move that seems natural then black wins with something like this: 43. ... 44. Kf2 Kd3 45. Ke1 h5 46. g3 e3 47. Kd1 e2+ 48. Ke1 Ke3 49. g4 hxg4 50. h5 g3 51. h6 g2 52. h7 g1=Q#

White responded with 4. a3 which seems to accomplish nothing. No black piece is held at bay and the threat of white playing a pawn to b4 seems minimal at best. Evidently white's intent was to allow the bishop a retreat along the a2-g8 diagonal after black plays a pawn to b5. Still black now plays 4. ... Nc6 to cover b4 and prevent white from advancing that pawn easily.

It seems to leave the black pawn at d5 hanging for white can win that pawn with 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 16. Bxd5. However then black replies 16. ...

It puts two attackers on the white pawn at a2 but he has two defenders and can easily be pushed forward to a3. From a5 the black queen can quickly reach the kingside. She covers e5 but she did that from c7 as well. It opens the half-open c-file for a rook but there is little for that rook to do. I think the main thing that motivated this move was fear of white playing Nd5 which would fork the black queen on c7 and black knight on f6 and almost force black to reply with Nxd5 allowing white to play exd5 freeing him from an isolated pawn. White only needs one more piece to make it work such as with Qf3.

White has the better pawn structure on the queenside where the Black bishop can't touch his pawns.  An important factor is that the Black bishop is the wrong color for his h-pawn and cannot control the queening square.  If some type of mutual zugzwang position is reached on the kingside White has two pawn moves a2-a3 & a3-a4 on the queenside.  White has the better king position.   However with pawns on both sides of the board the long reaching bishop is probably the better minor piece.

The White King has to stay at f3 to keep the Black king from invading at g4 and if the knight leaves g2 the White kingside pawns fall.  If Black moved his bishop somewhere on the h2-b8 diagonal I was going to play Ne3 and take the f5 pawn while Black gobbled up my g&h pawn.  It looked like I could win the c6 pawn with my knight.  After that I could play a2-a3 b3-b4 and trade off my knight and queenside pawns for Black's queenside pawns.  The h-pawn dark-square bishop and king vs lone White king was a book draw.
239,12,21,3Bxh4,b'8/7p/2p5/p1p2pPk/2P4b/1P3K2/P5N1/8 w - -',?? Black trades into a lost pawn endgame.  35 ...f4 is interesting.  White is in zugzwang on the kingside and has to use one of his pawn tempi on the queenside.  After that Black must shuttle his bishop between g3 & h2 while White shuttles his knight from g2 to e1.

I have recently been annotating games based on chess blunders and some of the types of blunder we all encounter in our chess careers.  But why do we blunder?  Do they come from a clear blue sky e.g. as a result of lack of concentration or poor board analysis?  Or does our opponent put us under so much pressure that we succumb and make that irreversible blunder?  In this game Freddy does put the squeeze on.  Even though I am a pawn up for the best part of the game I still end up right in the mire and eventually lose a piece - I play on - more on that one later but at the end ..... guess what .....

It has to be said that even when a piece down an active rook or queen can keep you in the game in the ending because of the possibility of perpetual check - the perpetual can also grab a few enemy pawns.  It did not work here because Henry was constantly in Old Matey's shadow.

I am in no mood to do this rather I feel like taking whatever I can from Freddy before he can deliver the blow.  It comes immediately after I take the pawn on a2 because Freddy set up a conditional move to put me out of my misery quickly.  It can be all so easy to crumble under pressure.

White could take it immediately but I spotted a little trap and preferred to bait the hook to see if black would nibble. So white deliberately leaves his pawn at d5 undefended (19. Qxb7 wins a pawn but it also defends d5 which I didn't want to do just yet). Probably not white's best course of action. If black declines the trap with 19. ... b6 white loses the opportunity to gain that pawn (and in the process passing his own pawn on a2).

Fortunately for me this is a real line of the Sicilian too the Rossolimo also known as the Hispano-Sicilian because of its similarity to the Ruy Lopez (Spanish Game).
361,16,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Black replies main line and white's main line reply would be 4. 0-0 but I went a different way with 4. Nc3 leading to the Anderssen Variation.
362,16,3,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2BnP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',4. ... Nd4 is the Anderssen Variation and that's about all I know about it. The DB said white should pull the bishop back to c4 so that's what white did.
363,16,4,d3,b'r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2BnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White might want to play Nb5 or Nxd4 some time soon so extra defense on e4 seems called for.
364,16,5,Ne2,b'r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2BpP3/3P4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White would lose the pawn on e4 right now if not for 7.d3.
365,16,6,1Nxd4,b'r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3p3/8/2BNn3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',A sneaky move by black. If white recaptures the knight with 10. dxe4 black wins the white bishop with 10. ... Qxc4 and now white is down a pawn though he now has 11. Qxd4 or 11. Nxd4 to restore material equality. However black would be much better developed and will have gained quite nicely positionally so the move as played 10. Nxd4 seems the better choice.
366,16,7,1Bb3,b'r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/3N4/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',Maybe wasting a tempo but a black pawn on d5 (or b5) looks inevitable and unstoppable and the white bishop feels much safer on b3.
367,16,8,1Bg3,b'r1b1k2r/1pq1bp2/p3pn1p/3p2p1/3N4/1B1P2B1/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Black ruined his kingside castle chasing the black bishop to g3 a good square for him right now aiming at the black queen on c7.
368,16,9,1Qf3,b'r1b1k2r/1pq2p2/p2bpn1p/3p2p1/3N4/1B1P1QB1/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',Adding defense for g3 but more interestingly threatening the black knight on f6. Currently this knight is the onnly defender of the pawn on d5 since the pawn on e6 is pinned to the black king. If black moves the knight d5 falls. 
369,16,10,1Nxe6,b'r1b1k2r/1pqn1p2/p2bN2p/3p2p1/8/1B1P1QB1/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',16. ... Nd7?? was a big blunder for black. 17. Nxe6!! is the proverbial lightning from a clear blue sky and it destroys black immediately though it's not immediately clear why. I began looking at lines involving 17. Qxd5 and 17. Bxd5 and they often ended up with Nxe6 somewhere along the way. Then I tried the old Reverse-the-Move-Order game and lo and behold this idea sprang up. Black's queen is en prise first and foremost. She could run but almost all available squares allow white to get her by moving the knight with discovered check. Of the few that don't such as 17. ... Qb6 white wins with 18. Nxg5+ Kd8 and one possible continuation much of which is forced goes like this: 19. Nxf7+ Kc7 20. Nxd6 Qb4 21. Nb5+ Kb6 22. Bc7+ Kxb5 23. Qxd5+ Nc5 24. a4+ Qxa4 25. Bxa4+ Kb4 26. Qc4# (and still wins black's queen along the way).
370,16,11,1Rxe6+,b'r1b1k2r/1pqn4/p2bR2p/3p2p1/8/1B1P1QB1/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b kq -',Having little better black accepts the sacrifice but that also seals his doom. Black has only two legal moves. 18. ... Be7 loses the queen immediately to 19. Bxc7 and 18. ... Kd8 19. Bxd6+ Qxd6 20. Rxd6 still wins the queen. And if black tries to run away say with 18. ... Kd8 19. Bxd6+ Qa5 then 20. Qf7 forces mate in 1 (2 if black stalls with 20. ... Qe1+). Since black has nothing better than losing his queen (after which white's attack is still overwhelming) he resigned at this point. I'm pleased with this little gem in the late opening/early middlegame and feel like it might redeem me a bit from my recent blunder/loss.

385,18,1,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Black hit me up with the Philidor an opening that wasn't very well appreciated in my tournament days in the 80s but seems to have renewed vigor here two decades later. White responds with the main line.
386,18,2,Nxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Main Line.
387,18,3,Nc3,b'rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I haven't seen 4. ... Bd7 yet. Doesn't seem threatening so white just plays along with the main line and pretends black did too.
388,18,4,Bb5,b'r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',Not really sure why white played this other than that it may have been in the DB. It invites some early exchanges but it doesn't seem to be overly advantageous.
389,18,5,Bg5,b'r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/3p1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Pinning the black knight to... nothing.
390,18,6,1O-O-O,b'r3k2r/pppqbppp/3p1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq -',Naturally.
391,18,7,1e5,b'r4rk1/pppqbppp/3p1n2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',The black pawn on d6 is pinned so it's time to charge in and make a nuissance of myself.
392,18,8,1Bxe7,b'r3nrk1/pppqBppp/3p4/4P3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',Looks like there could be a pawn to be won here though black can squirm out I believe.
393,18,9,1Nd5,b'r4rk1/ppp1qppp/3n4/3N4/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',13. ... Nxd6 seems natural but it loses a pawn. Better was 13. ... Qxd6 which seems to hold on to even material at the cost of isolating a black pawn on the d-file.
394,18,10,1Nxc7,b'r4rk1/ppNq1ppp/3n4/8/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',It's hardly worth calling it a sacrifice since white will regain the material immediately.
395,18,11,1Qd5,b'r4rk1/pp3ppp/8/3Q4/2q5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',Black avoids exchanging queens but white is eager to eliminate material now. This move has the added advantage of defending the white pawn on a2 that was en prise and it forks the black queen and the black pawn on b7.
396,18,12,1Qxb7,b'r4rk1/pQ3ppp/8/8/8/8/PPP2qPP/1K1R3R b - -',A little fork of black's own keeps material even.
397,18,13,2Qd4,b'1r3rk1/p4ppp/8/8/3Q4/8/PPP2qPP/1K1R3R b - -',Forks the black queen and the pawn on a7. I thought surely this would force the issue trade queens since black wouldn't want to lose another pawn.
398,18,14,2Qxa7,b'1r3rk1/Q4ppp/8/5q2/8/8/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Two pawns up heading into the end game. Surely a won position.
399,18,15,2Qa4,b'1rr3k1/5ppp/8/5q2/Q7/8/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - -',Black threatened a mate in 2.
400,18,16,2Rhe1,b'1rr3k1/5ppp/4q3/8/Q7/8/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - -',Sights on e8 though not quite enough firepower on that square to make it work yet.
401,18,17,2Qd4,b'1rr3k1/5ppp/1q6/8/3Q4/8/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - -',Defending mate in 1. I'm beginning to wonder if I can win this position. Black has multiple powerful attacks down the half-open files at white's king and white has no similar attacking avenues because of the very two pawns by which he ahead in material.
402,18,18,2Re3,b'1rr3k1/5ppp/8/q7/3Q4/4R3/PPP3PP/1K1R4 b - -',Black threatens the white rook on e1. It's defended but I've been known to move the wrong rook in other games... My goal here is to get my rooks in front of my king and block the attacks on the half-open files maybe trade some rooks while I'm at it and maybe even triple my attack down the d-file hoping for a back-rank mate.
403,18,19,2Rc3,b'1rr3k1/2q2ppp/8/8/3Q4/2R5/PPP3PP/1K1R4 b - -',And there's my blunder. 27. Rc3?? just throws away the rook for nothing. My thinking? I glanced at the position I knew I wanted to use my rooks on the third rank to block black's files and the rook is guarded by two pieces. Even better after black moves his queen white would play Rxc8 and exchange one pair of rooks. I moved too fast completely overlooking the fact that the pawn on b2 is pinned. The position just seemed so safe I didn't give it the attention it deserved. I hardly gave it any attention at all.
404,18,20,2Kc1,b'1r4k1/5ppp/8/8/8/2r5/PPP3PP/2KR4 b - -',And that's it from ahead by two pawns to down by a rook. I wonder if there's still a win or a draw here banking on three adjacent pawns supported by a rook and king. Can white promote? Can white threaten to promote strongly enough that black must give up a rook to prevent it? I played out numerous continuations from here but I didn't find a way to force that to happen. Not much to see from this point on...
405,18,21,3b4,b'1r4k1/5ppp/8/8/PP6/2r5/2P3PP/2KR4 b - -',Trying to be sneaky. I'm dead anyway might as well bait the trap. If black plays 32. ... Rxb4??? then white wins with 33. Rd8#. I know it's too obvious but hey so was 27. Rc3?? and I still blew it. One can always hope for a little tit for tat.
406,18,22,3Rg3,b'1r4k1/5ppp/8/8/r7/2P3R1/6PP/2K5 b - -',Now I'm mostly just stalling. Frankly I had a nice winning streak going and had several other games about to reach favorable conclusions (including my other match game against this opponent) thereby extending the streak. So I'm dragging my feet a bit. Hey if black wants a quick win he should force a quick win. Too petty? Well until black breaks up his pawns or at least plays Kf8 I'm still hoping he might slip up. And at least I had the courtesy to tell him directly over the e-board in the game comments.
407,18,23,3Rb3,b'6k1/5ppp/8/2r5/r7/1R6/6PP/1K6 b - -',One last try. Could happen... Though 39. Rd3 might have been better but I felt it was also more obvious.
408,18,24,4Rd3,b'6k1/5ppp/8/2r5/2r5/3R4/6PP/1K6 b - -',OK he got me. I try one more time but black's next move seals white's doom forever more. After 40. ... g6 I have extended my winning streak enough and exhausted all hope of pulling off a sneaky last-minute back-rank mate in this game so I resign.
409,18,25,4g6,b'6k1/5p1p/6p1/2r5/2r5/3R4/6PP/1K6 w - -',
410,19,0,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The match continues Remohgramps vs me. I'm black this time. My opponent opens with 1. d4 so I reply Indian style.
411,19,1,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',The Trompowski Opening would suggest 2. Bg5. By comparison 2. Bf4 seems a bit mild and not part of any line I have found against the Indian system.
412,19,2,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/4B3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq -',Interesting. I wonder if he'll trade. 2. Be4 violates one of the minor opening principles that suggests not moving bishops until after moving their adjacent knights. 3. Be5 violates another opening principle that it's generally unwise to move a piece a second time until you've developed the rest of your pieces.
413,19,3,Bxf6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p1bp1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Yep he traded.
414,19,4,Bg4,b'rn1qk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p1bp1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Maybe 6. ... Bf5 was a little weak inviting white to play 7. e4 and gain a tempo. But g4 didn't seem to be any better expecting a quick push of the white pawn to h3. Nor does e6 look better with white able to push his pawn to d5. I guess d7 was OK but I kind of want a knight there to help support a black pawn on c5. Maybe black should have gone that route first.
415,19,5,Nd7,b'r2qk2r/pppnpp1p/3p1bp1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Planning 8. ... c5.
416,19,6,dxe5,b'r2qk2r/pppnpp1p/5bp1/4p3/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',I looked at this move and thought that with 9. dxe5 black could win at least the e5 pawn outright (maybe with something like e9. dxe5 10. dxe5 Bxf3 11. Bxf3? Bxe5). Or if white is careless black could win a piece (I am looking now and can't find it but I'm pretty sure in my head during the game I thought I had at least one way to come out a piece up with bad play by white). Truth is all black managed to accomplish here is an even exchange of some material. Had I worked this out better in advance I would not have chosen a long sequence of exchanges that liquidates half the material on the board and leaves white with a superior position threatening to give away a draw to a player rated 600+ points lower than me (I much prefer to keep things complicated when playing with such a favorable disparity in the ratings invite my opponent to make mistakes) so I think I'll give 9. ... dxe5? a question mark.
417,19,7,Rxd8,b'3rk2r/ppp1pp1p/5bp1/4n3/6b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R w KQk -',More exchanges.
418,19,8,Bxe2,b'3rk2r/ppp1pp1p/5bp1/4N3/8/2N5/PPP1bPPP/R3K2R w KQk -',Now black is ahead by a pawn. If 13. Kxe2? or 13. Nxe2? then black replies with 13. ... Bxe4 and remains a pawn ahead. White does have a sneaky move here though. By about the 10th move I had revised my evaluation of the exchanges but it was too late the snowball was rolling down the hill. I saw 13. Nxf7 coming but I was hoping my opponent wouldn't see it.
419,19,9,Kxf7,b'3r3r/ppp1pk1p/5bp1/8/8/2N5/PPP1bPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',The two black rooks are forked. Black must capture on f7 or lose the exchange. But he doesn't have to capture on f7 immediately. During the game a few moves back it occurred to me that a zwischenzug here with 13. ... Bxc3+ would wreck white's queenside pawn structure isolating all three pawns and doubling two of them on the c-file. I had planned to play it. Then when it got to black's 13th move I totally forgot that plan and played too quickly to prevent the fork losing that chance.
420,19,10,b6,b'3r3r/p1p1pk1p/1p3bp1/8/8/8/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Now it's ugly. Material is even but white has two sets of three adjacent pawns while black has an isolated pawn on the half-open e-file. Black wants to play 14. ... Bxb2 but white would reply with 15. Rxb1 and 16. Rxb7 recovering the pawn and getting a powerful rook on the 7th rank. So 14. ... g6 is intended to prevent that knowing full well that white won't allow such an obvious pawn capture.
421,19,11,Rd6,b'7r/p1p1pk1p/1p1r1bp1/8/8/2P5/PP2NPPP/R3K2R w KQ -',Whit eprotected his b2 pawn and black prepares to double rooks on the only open file. 
422,19,12,Rd2,b'7r/p1p1pk1p/1p3bp1/8/8/2P5/PP1rNPPP/R4RK1 w - -',16. ... 0-0? was a blunder. With even material and a superior pawn structure white was heading for a winnable endgame or at least an easy draw (not bad for being a 600+ point underdog). But the white king was protecting d2 and by castling he gives that square up to black's rook. Black is now forking the knight on e2 and the pawn on b2. One of them must go.
423,19,13,Rxb2,b'7r/p1p1pk1p/1p3bp1/8/5N2/2P5/Pr3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Ah that's better. This now looks like a winnable endgame for black.
424,19,14,exf6,b'7r/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/8/8/2P5/Pr3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',White makes two mistakes with one move. 19. Nxf6? trades pieces when white is behind in material. Also it allows black to un-isolate his e-pawn with 19. ... exf6. Of course any other move by the white knight allows 19. ... Bxc3 although 19. Nb4 (threatening to recapture after 19. ... Bxc3 with 20. Nxc6) seems to hold onto everything. 19. ... c5 chases the knight back to d5 where it defends c3 and can be supported by 20. c4 then 21. Ne3 if black attacks the knight on d5 and 19. ... a5? just allows white to immediately capture on c6. 19. ... Rc8 gives white time for 20. Rfc1.
425,19,15,Rxe1+,b'8/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/8/8/2P3P1/Pr3P1P/R3r1K1 w - -',21. Rfe1? offers black a 6-for-5 trade exchanging rooks and gaining the pawn on a2 in the bargain.
426,19,16,Rc2,b'8/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/8/7P/2P3P1/2r2P2/4R1K1 w - -',Might as well hunt the last white pawn on the queenside - it might interfere with the black promotion steamroller.
427,19,17,Ke6,b'8/p6p/1pp1kpp1/8/7P/2P3P1/2r2P2/3R2K1 w - -',OK now I got nervous. Black dares not allow white to get his rook on the 7th rank forking the king (who was on f7) and the pawn on a7. But white will either get there or get a three-move repetition draw (the white rook can keep threatening to move to d7 or e7 and any moves by the black king to prevent it would be met with checks until eventually black repeats the position three times or abandons the 7th rank). Now that black is ahead in material and faced with a certain win I am of no mind to allow the repetition draw so I may have to let that rook rampage on the 7th.
428,19,18,Rxc3,b'8/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/8/5P1P/2r3P1/8/4R1K1 w - -',White doesn't seem to see it so black gobbles the last queenside pawn. This makes me much more comfortable with white getting to the 7th rank now.
429,19,19,Rc5,b'8/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/2r5/5P1P/6P1/5K2/4R3 w - -',White still didn't force his way to the 7th rank so now black shuts that down entirely.
430,19,20,Rd5,b'8/p4k1p/1pp2pp1/3r4/5P1P/6P1/5K2/3R4 w - -',And now white goes for it and black denies it. No white rook on the 7th today not now anyway.
431,19,21,cxd5,b'8/p4k1p/1p3pp1/3p4/5P1P/6P1/5K2/8 w - -',Not that white had any further winning/drawing chances without serious blunders by black but trading his last piece with 29. Rxd5? is definitely the final nail in white's coffin.
432,19,22,a5,b'8/7p/1p2kpp1/p2p4/3K1P1P/6P1/8/8 w - a6',Black wants to get his king to e5 but not at the cost of losing the e-pawn after 31. ... Kf5. I considered doing it anyway then demolishing white's kingside pawns and promoting on the kingside while white was busy preventing queenside promotion but that felt a little too much like running up the score. Much more fun to pretend the six kingside pawns don't exist.
433,19,23,a4,b'8/7p/1p2kpp1/3p4/p4P1P/2K3P1/8/8 w - -',Baiting the white king further.
434,19,24,b5,b'8/7p/4kpp1/1p1p4/pK3P1P/6P1/8/8 w - -',White cannot play Kxb5 now or any time hence because he will then lose the foot race with the a-pawn as it successfully sprints for promotion on a1.
435,19,25,d4,b'8/7p/4kpp1/1p6/p2p1P1P/K5P1/8/8 w - -',Bait. At this point I entered a few sets of conditional moves all based off of advancing the d-pawn getting white to chase that pawn then advancing the a-pawn etc. Any captures by white guarantees the promotion of the other pawn so eventually he'll capture one and black will promote the other.
436,19,26,d3,b'8/7p/4kpp1/1p6/pK3P1P/3p2P1/8/8 w - -',Following the plan (actually this was part of the conditional moves that white played while I wasn't looking).
437,19,27,Kd5,b'8/7p/5pp1/1K1k4/p4P1P/3p2P1/8/8 w - -',However 36. Kxb5 was not one of my conditional moves. I figured white to stop one queen rather than allow both. Not that black needs two queens. Black takes the opposition chasing white to the edge so that after the d-pawn promotes there will be less chasing to do.
438,19,28,d1=Q+,b'8/7p/5pp1/3k4/K4PPP/8/8/3q4 w - -',Check.
439,19,29,Qb6#,b'8/7p/Kqk2pp1/6P1/5P1P/8/8/8 w - -',Final position.
440,20,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A very flexible opening move that could lead anywhere.
441,20,1,b3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',An unexpected continuation.  White clearly plans a Queenside fianchetto attacking Black's potential kingside castled position.  How should Black respond?  He can either choose to oppose the finachetto with one of his own either Kingside or Queenside or to develop his bishops centrally.  2...d6 will contest the e5 square and release the wsb.  2...e6 will lay claim to d5 and release the dsb.  Other possibilities were 2. c5 contesting the d4 square and postponing the question of where to develop the Bs or 2...d5 laying claim to e4 or 2...Nc6 contesting d4 and e5.
442,20,2,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I opt to contest the long dark diagonal immediately with my own dsb.  I realise that this could be risky but I feel the need to play combatively.
443,20,3,g5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/6P1/8/1P3N2/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQ -',This pawn's second move may appear to defy opening principles but by attacking the N it forces Black to move that N a second time and prepares to break up Black's castled position so it is quite justified by the concrete considerations of the actual position on the board.
444,20,4,Ne8,b'rnbqnrk1/ppppppbp/6p1/6P1/8/1P3N2/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQ -',?! defending the B OK but this move is less flexible than 5...Nh5 whence it would also defend the B but it could also have been left there to block the h file if I'd chosen to recapture with my K.  My posture at this stage is entirely defensive: hardly my intention when choosing to fianchetto kingside.
445,20,5,c5,b'r2q1rk1/pp1nppnp/3p2p1/2p3P1/3PP1b1/1P3N2/P1PNBP1P/R2QK2R w KQ c6',I preferred this thrust to 10...e5 because I preferred to keep f6 covered by a pawn.  If White takes on c5 I recapture with the N and I preserve my pawn structure White having loosened his bind on the centre.  If White pushes forward to d5 he leaves me e5 for my N.
446,20,6,Qa5,b'2r2rk1/3nppnp/p2p2p1/qppP2P1/2P1P2P/1P6/P2NQP1N/R3K2R w KQ -',developing my Q to its most active potential position and pinning White's Nd2.  I'm not actually threatening anything yet though.

450,20,10,hxg6,b'5rr1/3n1k2/3p1pp1/p1pP3n/PpP1P1RP/1P2NN2/7K/5R2 w - -',So far White doesn't seem to have achieved much.  He has cleared the f and g files of his pawns but Black's remain...

453,20,13,3Nf5+,b'6r1/3nkr2/3pNpp1/p1pP1N1n/PpP1P1RP/1P6/7K/5R2 b - -',! exploiting the pin on the g-pawn: if 36...gxf5 37. Rxg8.  But even if Black avoids this he is doomed: his only other move is 36...Ke8 when 37. Nxd6+ forks K and Rf7 so 37...Ke7 38. Nxf7 Kxf7 and White has a winning position though I haven't worked out exactly how he converts it into a mating one.
454,20,14,3Rf5,b'6R1/3nkr2/3pNp2/p1pP1R1n/PpP1p2P/1P6/7K/8 b - -',"but this effectively stymied that hope.  The N has nowhere to go so Black has to defend it with 38...Rh7 when it too has nowhere to go.  White can sweep up Black's errant pawn either by pulling the Rg8 back or swinging across with his K.  Recognising that I was lost I resigned.  very well played by my 13-year-old opponent.
PS My ECF grade is 124 his is 136.  I've been converting these to ELO by multiplying by 8 and adding 650.  I've been told by Paul Trewhela also of Banbury that I'm using the wrong conversion equation but I'm sticking to it for now as at least I'm being consistent."
455,21,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi all here is a little gamelet from about when I first started chess - maybe a month later. A little informal blitz tournament which came after a coaching session. I had the misfortune of being paired against a good friend of mine in Round 2...for his sakes I'll call him N.N. (I'd just like to make it clear that this game is for entertainment value only as with many blitz games!). Anyway onto the moves...you can see how old this game is as I was at the time playing 1.e4.
456,21,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The uncommon Nimzowitsch Defence. Develops a piece.
457,21,2,Bb5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Premature. The best move is definitely 2.d4 here occupying the centre. At the time I was hoping to mess up Black's pawn formation by doubling his pawns on the c-file. As a beginner I for some reason saw doubled pawns as an out-and-out liability...a weakness which resulted in many a painful loss.
458,21,3,Ne5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B2n3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Forcing Black to waste a tempo with his knight had not occurred to me for the simple reason that at the time I had no comprehension whatsoever of the value of time (i.e. number of moves) in chess. However my favourite activity was using the underestimated pawns to shove my opponents' pieces around. Knights are particularly susceptible to this as we are about to see.
459,21,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B2n3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq d3',Yay! Gaining space with tempo and my opponent's silly horse has to leap out of sight.
460,21,5,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Not quite out of sight. Never mind. I had no intention of relenting from annoying and harrassing my opponent's pieces.
461,21,6,d5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B1P4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',The intrepid pawns move forward into the opponent's half and the stupid knight has to get some more exercise.
462,21,7,Ne5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B1Pn3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',The knight is running around in circles. Truly pawns are the soul of chess (Andre Dani Philidor).
463,21,8,Ng6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/6n1/1B1P4/4PP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',White's powerful pawn centre is faintly reminiscent of the Alekhine's Defence; Four Pawns Attack. Playing nowadays I would have been content to hold on to this pawn structure. But not then.
464,21,9,f5,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/6n1/1B1P1P2/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',Let's see how far we can advance our units with tempo.
465,21,10,Bf4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B1PnP2/4PB2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq -',Time to develop a few pieces behind the broad shoulders of my powerful central pawns. Even I had to be content with a pawn centre as dominant as that. It wasn't that I saw that 7.c4? a6 8.Ba4 Nxc4 loses me a pawn...it just didn't occur to me to play 7.c4. Good thing really.
466,21,11,f6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/1B1PnP2/4PB2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq -',Obviously the knight has nowhere to do he has to content himself with defending with a pawn. Black chose the WRONG PAWN! He has opened himself up to attacks on the kingside and my f-pawn is perfectly placed to help.
467,21,12,Qh5+,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/1B1PpP1Q/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',Time to call in the town bully (to quote GM Yasser Seirawan). Even I could see a (practically) winning attack when it danced under my nose.
468,21,13,1fxg6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp2p/6P1/1B1Pp2Q/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',I was expecting I confess 10...hxg6 11.Qxg6#. I wasn't thinking about the saving move 10...Bg7 or 10...Bh6. I also wasn't expecting the stylish and unusual option that followed...
469,21,14,1g7#,b'r1bqkbnr/ppppp1P1/7p/1B1Pp2Q/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq -',Checkmate with a pawn. A nice way to end a blitz tournament game.
470,22,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',My toughest victory to date a hard fought game against Joanne. It's an unrated game because when she challenged me Joanne's rating was 140 points higher than mine (1627 vs. 1767) so she went for friendly rather than fierce. She begins with the Open Game and I respond with the Sicilian.
471,22,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I only know three things about 2. Ne2. One it's called the Keres Variation. Two none of my references on the Sicilian give it any analysis. Three I handled it badly and got into trouble very early in this game.
472,22,2,cxd4,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Natural looking developing moves.
473,22,3,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',This was a mistake the consequences of which black will regret for at least the next 20 moves or so. Black should have played 5. ... a6. I'm (obviously) no openings expert and I've forgotten almost all that I knew 25 years ago when I played competitively. I have learned primarily from this game (and from not making this mistake in other games as black) that 5. .. a6 is pretty close to mandatory. White's knights are going to be a terror on the queenside for much of this game.
474,22,4,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/1N2p1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Finally.

477,22,7,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/1p3ppp/p2p1b2/3Np3/2NnP1b1/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',Here I thought I was being quite sneaky.
478,22,8,Nxc2+,b'r2qk2r/1p3ppp/p2p1b2/3Np3/2N1P1Q1/8/PPn2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',See how sneaky?
479,22,9,Nxa1,b'r2qk2r/1p3ppp/p2p1b2/3Np3/2N1P1Q1/8/PP1K1PPP/n4B1R w kq -',Yay ahead in material but that knight on a1 is doomed and then we'll be even with white much better positionally.
480,22,10,Rb8,b'1r1qk2r/1p3ppp/pN1p1b2/4p3/2N1P1Q1/8/PP1K1PPP/n4B1R w k -',There go those white knights terrorizing my queenside. It's now that I wish I had kept a bishop or knight around to fight off the evil white equines. Black is in a real bind. The queen's rook is stuck on b8. the queen cannot go to d7 to bring the black bishop to d8 and she's tied to defense of the pawn on d6. All of black's major pieces are bound to the back rank.
481,22,11,Nb3+,b'1r1qk2r/1p3ppp/pN1p1b2/4p3/2N1P1Q1/1n1B4/PP1K1PPP/7R w k -',More sneakiness I guess. The knight has to die might as well make white double her pawns to kill him. Actually this little tactic will pay off in 20 or so moves. 
482,22,12,Bg5+,b'1r1q1rk1/1p3ppp/pN1p4/4p1b1/2N1P1Q1/1P1B4/1P1K1PPP/3R4 w - -',Probably not black's cleverest line. What I really want to do is trade places with my queen and bishop getting the bishop on d8 to drive off white's knight from b6. But it would take a bit of maneuvering maybe with Qc7 Bd8 Qe7 - if white would even sit still for it. But this pointless check with Bg5+ is just wasting time mostly though it does give a little room for the king's rook to come out and play.
483,22,13,Rg6,b'1r1q2k1/1p3ppp/pN1p2r1/4p1b1/2N1P1Q1/1P6/1PB2PPP/3R1K2 w - -',White seems to be just shifting about dragging her king to safety (from what?) and shuffling pieces. Although getting her king and bishop off of the d-file opened up the white rook's attack on d6. Black's little sneaky ploy if white is careless would be to play 21. ... Be3 discovering the attack by the rook against white's queen followed by 22. ... Bxb6.
484,22,14,Bf4,b'1r1q2k1/1p3ppp/pN1p2r1/4p3/2N1Pb2/1P6/1PB1QPPP/3R1K2 w - -',Yeah I didn't think it would happen. Still one must try. Now black is poking at h2 and opening the way for Qg5.
485,22,15,Qh6,b'1r4k1/1p3ppp/pN1p2rq/4p3/2N1Pb2/1P3Q1P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',Well something had to be done about the pawn on d6 attacked by knight and rook. It was either this or Rd8. But 23. ... Rd8 is met with 24. Na4 and the lonely pawn on b7 would be in trouble requiring 24. ... Qe7 and then 25. Nd5 forks black's queen and the bishop on f4 and now white will win either the e5 pawn or the b7 pawn. What a sad sad place for a queen. Note: not 23. ... Qf6? allowing 24. Nd7 and white wins the exchange.
486,22,16,Re6,b'1r4k1/1p3ppp/p2pr2q/3Np3/2N1Pb2/1P3Q1P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',White threatened Ne7+ winning the exchange.
487,22,17,exf4,b'1r4k1/1p3ppp/p2pr2q/8/2N1Pp2/1P3Q1P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',Now black's pawn structure takes a little hit isolating the d6 pawn. Still it was already backward so isolated isn't much worse. Thankfully white voluntarily got rid of one of those pesky knights. Now maybe black will have a little room to breath.
488,22,18,Qf6,b'1r4k1/1p3ppp/pN1prq2/8/4Pp2/1P3Q1P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',Hunting the white b2 pawn while still protecting the black f4 pawn. Note that white can fork the black queen and the rook at b8 with 27. Nd7 but it wins no material after 27. ... Qxb2 28. Nxb8 Qxc7 and now the white knight at b8 is trapped. After 29. Nd7 Qc7 the knight has nowhere to go and must die (actually 29. Nxa6 is probably best gaining at least a pawn but even then white has exchanged bishop+knight+pawn for rook+pawn).
489,22,19,Qd8,b'1r1q2k1/1p3ppp/pN1pr3/8/4Pp2/1PQ4P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',White avoided the pitfalls and now seriously threatens the fork at d7. Black could trade queens but that would liberate the only advantage he has on the board the isolated white pawns. Now black avoids the fork and chases away the white knight.
490,22,20,Rc8,b'2rq2k1/1p3ppp/p2pr3/3N4/4Pp2/1PQ4P/1PB2PP1/3R1K2 w - -',Black's pawn on f4 is en prise but the rook on b8 smells its first breath of fresh air and pounces on a chance at the open c-file.
491,22,21,f3,b'2rq2k1/1p3ppp/p2pr3/3N4/4P3/1P3p1P/1PBQ1PP1/3R1K2 w - -',The black pawn was twice attacked and could not be safely defended so it marches off to suicide its only compensation is the destruction of the white kingside pawn structure. Well truthfully black can get the pawn back on h3 easily enough so it's not too much of a suicide - more like a sacrifice.
492,22,22,Kh8,b'2r4k/1p3ppp/p2pr3/3N4/4P2q/1P3P1P/1PBQKP2/3R4 w - -',Not 31. Kg2? to try and hold the pawn at h3 allowing 31. ... Rg6+ 32. Kf1 Qxh3+ capturing the pawn with check and gaining a tempo. Now that pawn at h3 isn't going anywhere and black is worried about the possible knight fork on e7. It's a shame to tie the rook on e6 down to the tedious task of defending against the fork. So 31. ... Kh8 seems to be called for to free the rook.
493,22,23,f5,b'2r4k/1p4pp/p2pr3/3N1p2/4P2q/1P3P1P/1P1QKP2/1B1R4 w - f6',The white pawn on e4 is pinned might as well attack it.
494,22,24,Re8,b'4r2k/1p4pp/p2p4/3N1p2/4P2q/1P3P1P/1P2KP2/1BQ5 w - -',Must prevent the back-rank mate.
495,22,25,fxe4,b'4r2k/1pQ3pp/p2p4/3N4/4p2q/1P3P1P/1P2KP2/1B6 w - -',Not much black can do about the queenside pawns so might as well get some kingside captures.
496,22,26,Qh5,b'4r2k/1pQ3pp/p2p4/3N3q/4B3/1P3P1P/1P2KP2/8 w - -',Now the bishop is pinned black's queen threatens 37. ... Qxd5 and winning the knight. I think white's strongest move here might have been simply 37. Qxd6 or 37. Qxb7.
497,22,27,Qxh3,b'4r2k/1pQ3pp/p2p4/3N4/4B3/1P1K1P1q/1P3P2/8 w - -',Finally capturing the doomed h3 pawn and evening the material - for now. Also black thratens 38. ... Qf1+ making horrible threats against white's king and other pieces. Note that white's pawn structure is in shambles and though material is even it's almost as if white is down by two pawns.
498,22,28,Qc8,b'2q1r2k/1pQ3pp/p2p4/3N4/4B3/1P3P2/1P2KP2/8 w - -',If 39. Qxd6 black plays 39. ... Qc7+ and wins at least one maybe both of white's queenside pawns.
499,22,29,Rxc8,b'2r4k/1p4pp/p2p4/3N4/4B3/1P3P2/1P2KP2/8 w - -',Finally 39 moves into the game I finally breathe a little easier. I've removed white's primary threats and ended up in a winnable endgame. Black's queenside pawns can hold their own against white's queenside and black has the passed pawn in the center at d6 that white must deal with and best of all black has a supported passed pawn on the h-file. It's too much for white's knight to cover both sides of the board so her knight will most likely end up on guard duty on one side while black's rook goes head-to-head with white's bishop on the other side - a material superiority especially given that black will have the superior pawns on that side too. That's the plan anyway now to put it into action.
500,22,30,Rc5,b'7k/1p4pp/pN1p4/2r5/4B3/1P3P2/1P2KP2/8 w - -',White cannot capture the black pawn with 41. Bxb7 for then 41. Rb5 skewers the white knight to the bishop. After 42. Bxa6 Rxb6 43. Bc4 Ra2 and 44. Rxb2 white will have traded away her knight for one pawn.
501,22,31,Rb5,b'7k/1p4pp/pN1p4/1r6/4B3/1P1K1P2/1P3P2/8 w - -',Even without the skewer the fork is dangerous enough. White must choose between losing the knight or the pawn.
502,22,32,d5,b'2N4k/1p4pp/p7/1r1p4/4B3/1P1K1P2/1P3P2/8 w - -',The black pawn at d6 was threatened. 42. ... Rxb3+ 43. Kc2 and now the black rook must run to safety but not to b6 and the pawn at d6 would still be en prise and would fall to 44. Nxd6. As played the white bishop must retreat to f5.
503,22,33,g6,b'2N4k/1p5p/p5p1/3p1B2/3K4/1r3P2/1P3P2/8 w - -',Black is finally ahead in material and could simply capture on f3 then f2. I'm not even sure why I played this zwischenzug; it doesn't seem to gain any advantage for black.
504,22,34,Rxb2,b'2N4k/1p5p/p3B1p1/3p4/3K4/5P2/1r3P2/8 w - -',Finally after wasting last move.

Bob had a R + Piece + Pawn for Glenda.  My opponent's material balance so nearly worked in his favour.  At the end Bob's rook two minor pieces and a pawn were swarming around Henry.

I had it in my mind that black couldn't simply take the pawn because it is guarded by the white queen. I completely overlooked the fact that black's queen is on the bishop's diagonal and would defend the bishop after 25. ... Bxa4. I realized this about 2 seconds after I clicked Submit.

566,25,13,3Qxc5,b'6k1/p4p1p/8/2Q5/q7/4P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',Done and done. A pawn ahead. Now all white has to do is pass and promote a pawn... Wait a minute. After all that planning and plotting suddenly I realize that black has a passed pawn and white's in trouble. Black's queen will guide that a-pawn all the way to promotion and there's nothing white can do to stop it. Worse white has no way to threaten to promote one of his own pawns fast enough to maintain any kind of balance. If black promotes it's game over. Seeing nothing better I play for a draw.

568,25,15,3Qxh7,b'8/4kp1Q/8/p7/q7/4P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - -',Next morning I found my opponent had left his h7 pawn to die. Now look what we have here. That black pawn on a5 is still imminently capable of winning this game. But now white has a passed pawn too and it's only 2 moves behind. Maybe we can do something about that or maybe not. But white still has the repetition draw up his sleeve so let's give black a little rope and see if he will hang himself instead of immediately playing for the draw.
569,25,16,3Qg4+,b'6k1/5p2/8/8/p5Q1/4P1P1/5PKP/q7 b - -',Ahh the sweet spot. Black won't trap himself on the h-file and now white's queen guards the white pawns advance toward promotion.

571,25,18,4Qg5,b'5k2/5p2/7P/6Q1/8/4P1P1/pq3PK1/8 b - -',A sly little queen move that accomplishes nothing. Black is about to have two queens on the board. Worse both black queens are on the a1-h8 diagonal protecting h8 the promotion square for white's pawn. Why hasn't white resigned? Remember that rope?
572,25,19,4Qd8#,b'3Q1k2/5p2/7P/8/8/4P1P1/1q3PK1/q7 b - -',Black has two queens but in his haste to promotion he failed to ask why white made that strange queen move 43. Qg5. I really hated to play the final move. Remohgramps is a friend and he played this game quite well. Had he seen the checkmate and prevented it white could probably still get a draw by chasing the black king around and looking for ways to get the white queen on a1. Or maybe not. Maybe black could tuck his king away and promote his pawn then win with two queens to white's one. I really hoped Remohgramps would see white's little trap and play something like 43. ... Qb8 or 43. ... Ke8. Instead he played 43. ... a1=Q??? (how often does a pawn promoting to queen get ???). Now that black had the two queens white is faced with winning or losing - no chance of a draw now. My hand was forced but I hated playing the move.

It turns out he wins back a bishop instead.   17.Qg3+ Bg5 18.h4 Rxh4 19.f4

I think this is how the line runs.    I haven't rechecked it so I'm analyzing it blindfold pretty well.     Could be wrong.

This might be a better option than what I played in the game but I have a ways to go developing still and my king is weak.

780,37,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Here is a very exciting sacrificial game I won recently. I play my usual Queen Pawn.

782,37,2,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays the Marshall Defence as after 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4 or 3.cxd5 Qxd5 4.Nc3 then 5.e4 White has superior central control.
783,37,3,Bd2,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',Preparing a cheap discovered attack on Black's queen. I am hoping that this may gain me an extra tempo later in the opening.
784,37,4,Bb4,b'rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/q7/1b1PP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',OK no more cheap discovered attack threats.

The only problem with this is that it allows Black to exchange bishops and queens thereby weakening White's assault but I decided that White's powerfully placed minor pieces and pawns with rooks coming in soon to help could still win the day.

800,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everybody this time it is my opponent who resigns when faced with seemingly unavoidable mate and a strong attack.  The game seems to move very slowly and quietly until I decide to mount a kingside attack late on in the game down the g file.  Queen Glenda threatens mate but I believe it can be stopped.  You the jury may have different ideas.  Anyhow.  This game starts off with a classical Ruy Lopez.
801,38,1,Ba4,b'r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',4. Ba4 - standard Lopez moves.

804,38,4,1Bb7,b'r2qk2r/1bp1bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1PP2N1P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w kq -',10. ..... Bb7 - piling up on the e4 pawn prompting d3.

821,38,21,Qxb7,b'8/1q4rk/p2p4/1p1P2rp/1P2Pp2/5P1P/1Q5K/2RR4 w - -',42. ...... Qxb7 - an exchange of knight for Fou Leblanc has taken Glenda away from that diagonal but she is very interested in d7 and h3!
822,38,22,Qd7,b'8/3q2rk/p2p4/1p1P3p/1P2Pp2/3R1PrP/5Q1K/2R5 w - -',44. ...... Qd7 - Glenda is threatening Qxh3# next move.  White can stop it with Qf1 giving me an interesting idea of exchanging those rooks for the Wicked Witch.  Glenda may be able to pick off some pawns with check and turn the game in my favour but my opponent waves the white flag!  This bumped my rating up to 1783 the highest in my chessic career.  Sadly losses against Freddy and a couple of low draws have pegged it back somewhat.  Still two or three of my current rated games are starting to look promising though I still have work to do in those in order to get my rating back into the 1780s.
823,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hi everyone!  Does anybody get a sinking feeling when you think you have a lost game.  You wave the white flag and in a post-match analysis with your opponent he tells you there was a way out and when he does it seems so bally patently obvious.  Here is an old game against Coach Ion that only now can I bring myself to annotate it.  I play the Nimsovich-Rossilimo Attack of the Sicilian but guess who ends up on the defensive .........
824,39,1,Bb5+,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
825,39,2,c3,b'r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2np4/1Bp1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq -',6. c3 - getting a bit like a Ruy Lopez.
826,39,3,Bf1,b'r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1np4/2p1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq -',7. Bf1 - I suppose I was following the db here but I wonder whether Ba4 might have been worth considering here transposing into a genuine Ruy Lopez.
827,39,4,1d5,b'r2qk1nr/1p2bppp/p1np4/3Pp3/4P1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq -',10. d5 - database recommends it but would taking on e5 been better?
828,39,5,Rc8,b'2rqk1nr/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Pp3/3nP1b1/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQRBK1 w k -',11. ...... Rc8 - threatening Nc2 nasty nasty so I play 12. Bd3 to prevent this.
829,39,6,1Nb3,b'2rqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/3Pp3/3nP1b1/1N1B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b k -',13. Nb3? - to free Fou Lenoir but allows an exchange on f3 busting up the position around King Henry.
830,39,7,Bh5,b'2rqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/3Pp2b/4P3/1N1B1P2/PP3P1P/R1BQR1K1 w k -',14....... Bh5 - maintaining a pin on f3.
831,39,8,1Bg2,b'2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p4/3Pp2b/4P3/1N2BP2/PP3PBP/R2QR1K1 b - -',17. Bg2 - my bishops make valiant attempts to plug the holes.
832,39,9,1Qd3,b'2rq1rk1/1p1nb1pp/p2p4/3Ppp1b/4P3/1N1QBP2/PP3PBP/R3R1K1 b - -',18. Qd3 - connects my rooks.
833,39,10,2Rac1,b'2rq1rk1/1p1n2pp/p2p4/3Pp2b/4Pp1b/1N1Q1P2/PP1B1PBP/2R1R1K1 b - -',20. Rac1 - contests the c file and creates possibilities of back row mates should Ion's heavies move off it!
834,39,11,2Qe2,b'2r2rk1/1p1n2pp/pq1p4/3Pp2b/4Pp1b/1N3P2/PP1BQPBP/2R1R1K1 b - -',21. Qe2 - forced - to defend f2.
835,39,12,Qxc5,b'5rk1/1p4pp/p2p4/2qPp2b/4Pp1b/5P2/PP1BQPBP/4R1K1 w - -',23. ....... Qxc5 - typical of jstevens1 - tries to exchange her way out of trouble but there is still quite a lot of ivory on the board!
836,39,13,Be8,b'4brk1/1p4pp/p2p4/2qPp3/4Pp1b/2B2P2/PP2QPBP/4R1K1 w - -',24....... Be8 - heading for b5.
837,39,14,2Re2,b'5rk1/1p1b2pp/p2p4/2qPp3/4Pp1b/2B2P2/PPQ1RPBP/6K1 b - -',26. Re2 - defending f2.  Now comes a rook swinger to g6 pinning Fou Leblanc to Henry.
838,39,15,2a4,b'6k1/1p1b2pp/p2p1r2/2qPp3/P3Pp1b/2B2P2/1PQ1RPBP/6K1 b - a3',27. a4 - to stop Bb5.
839,39,16,Qd8,b'3q2k1/1p1b2pp/p2p2r1/3Pp3/P3Pp1b/2B2P2/1P1QRPBP/7K w - -',29. ....... Qd8.  Here I overlook the fact that Glenda has time to get to f3 to defend Fou Leblanc and wave the white flag. I used to resign in the pre-Freddy era when faced with unavoidable mate so here is one advantage of playing games out to mate - you avoid this scenario.   Although notice my a4 pawn is hanging and Ion has 2 chances to take it as Glenda has had to move away from its protection.  This would have left me with a very difficult endgame with my remaining pawn structure busted.  In those circumstances it was still worth playing on. Thankfully premature resignation on my part has been a very rare occurrence.
