0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

You would never believe that a queen could find herself without a move in a queen and pawn ending would you?  Well it happens here.  I will now start this game with the Scandinavian Defense.  I ended up in a similar position against damalfi and went on to lose but here it was a different story.  The Scandinavian (Centre Counter) is the move 1..... d5 in response to e4.  Black brings his/her queen out into the open before any other pieces are developed but it can be possible to find a safe haven for her on a5.  Anyhow ....."
1,0,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ..... Nf6 - interesting black does not recapture but develops a piece.
2,0,2,Bxe6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',4. ..... dxe6 - my 1 pawn advantage is preserved for the nonce but now I need to concentrate on developing my pieces.
3,0,3,Qe2,b'rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',6. Qe2 - this move is recommended in the database but I am not altogether comfortable with it.  In fact Fou Leblanc stays on f1 for a good part of the middlegame and Henry gets some rather hairy moments.
4,0,4,Be3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/8/2PP4/4BN2/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ -',8. Be3 - funnily enough d5 is not recommended in the db maybe because Henry is still caught in the centre and there is a potential for a really nasty pin from a black rook on the e column - and Glenda is right in front of Henry.  I must get my pieces out as quickly as possible and then move Henry to safety.
5,0,5,Bxe4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n5/8/2PPb3/4BN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',10. ...... Bxe4 - knight trade.
6,0,6,1d5,b'2kr1b1r/pppq1ppp/2n5/3P4/2P1b3/P3BN2/1P2QPPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',12. d5 - only now is this move played.  Funnily enough this very weak and vulnerable pawn stays on this square for the remaining part of the game.  I am toying with the prospect of putting Henry on the kingside and mounting a queenside mating attack.
7,0,7,1b4,b'2kr1b1r/pppq1ppp/8/n2P4/1PP5/P3B3/2bNQPPP/R3KB1R b KQ b3',14. b4 - I now make that queen knight do the Hip Hop Beat!  It moves to b3 but I take the opportunity to trade knights - maxim if material up (piece or less) exchange pieces rather than pawns to ensure that endgame win!
8,0,8,Qa4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/qPP5/Pb2B3/1Q3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',16. ..... Qa4 - the appearance of the Wicked Witch of the West dissuades me in my quest to launch that queenside mating attack.  I now concentrate on Plan B.  Get Henry to safety on the kingside.
9,0,9,1Be2,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/qPP5/Pb2B3/1Q2BPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',17. Be2 - at last Fou Leblanc moves and now Henry can castle which he finally does next move.

11,0,11,2Bd4,b'1k1r3r/ppp3pp/3b1p2/3P4/qPPB4/P7/1Q3PPP/R2R2K1 b - -',21. Bd4 - pressure on black's a1-h8 diagonal perhaps?
12,0,12,Qd7,b'1k1rr3/pppq2pp/5p2/3P4/1PPB1b2/P5P1/1Q3P1P/R3R1K1 w - -',23. ..... Qd7 - the Wicked Witch of the West has a cunning plan.  If I take Pitroque's dsb then I will concede a Low Draw by allowing Ye Olde Perpetualle due to the open g column.  So I prevent the Witch from landing on g4 by playing f3.
13,0,13,2Qf2,b'1k1rr3/pppq2pp/5p1b/3P4/1PPB4/P4PP1/5Q1P/R3R1K1 b - -',25. Qf2 - threatening Bxa7+.
14,0,14,2Qxe3,b'1k1r4/ppp3pp/5p2/3P4/qPP5/P3QPP1/7P/R5K1 b - -',28. Qxe3 - just what I want a plethora of exchanges.  Now it is just the queens and rooks.
15,0,15,2Qd3,b'1k2r3/ppp3pp/5p2/3P4/qPP5/P2Q1PP1/7P/R5K1 b - -',29. Qd3 - this is Glenda's berth for the remainder of this game.  You would never believe that the Wicked Witch of the West sitting pretty on a4 is gonna get trapped on such an open board would you?
16,0,16,2a5,b'1k2r3/1pp3pp/5p2/p2P4/qPP5/P2Q1PP1/7P/R5K1 w - a6',29. ..... a5?? - here is the blunder.  Now I thought long and hard as to whether I should take this pawn but then I thought Hello I can immobilise the witch right now with ......
17,0,17,3b5,b'1k2r3/1pp3pp/5p2/pP1P4/q1P5/P2Q1PP1/7P/R5K1 b - -',30. b5!! - This little pawn move now cuts off the Witch and Glenda finds herself defending some very important squares a3 for starters and then b3 c2 and the rook and Glenda both defend d1.  Ooops also c4 I quite forgot!  Then that humble pawn on a3 covers the b4 square.  Hey Ho the Wicked Witch is trapped!!  So how do I exploit this fact?  Firstly I will exchange the remaining pair of rooks.  I will leave Glenda exactly where she is and then use Henry as a fighting piece.  With me being a pawn up it will effectively be a won K&P ending.  Henry is already licking his lips at the thought of scoffing his favourite seafood - p(r)awns!
18,0,18,3Kf2,b'1k2r3/2p3pp/1p3p2/pP1P4/q1P5/P2Q1PP1/5K1P/R7 b - -',31. Kf2 - a multi-purpose move.  It gets Henry towards the centre and it prepares that exchange of rooks.
19,0,19,3Kxe1,b'1k6/2p4p/1p3pp1/pP1P4/q1P5/P2Q1PP1/7P/4K3 b - -',33. Kxe1 - Henry has had to retreat to recapture the black rook but from now on in The Only Way is Up as far as he is concerned.  Yup as I type I am humming that tune by Yazz right now!
20,0,20,3Ke3,b'8/1kp4p/1p4p1/pP1P1p2/q1P5/P2QKPP1/7P/8 b - -',35. Ke3 - Here we go here we go here we go!
21,0,21,3Ke5,b'2k5/2p4p/1p6/pP1PKp2/q1P2Pp1/P2Q2P1/7P/8 b - -',38. Ke5 - Ravenous Henry is just about to tuck in!
22,0,22,4Kxg4,b'8/2p4p/1p1k4/pP1P4/q1P2PK1/P2Q2P1/7P/8 b - -',40. Kxg4 - two black kingside pawns drop off yum and double yum says Henry!
23,0,23,4f5,b'8/2p4p/1p6/pPkP1P2/q1P3K1/P2Q2P1/7P/8 b - -',41. f5 - I eschew that black pawn on h7 as I need to keep the Witch boxed in.  Yes the weak pawn on c4 can be taken but that is not a problem because I calculated that this pawn would be able to reach Glendadom on f8 just in time should Pitroque decide to force an exchange of queens.
24,0,24,4Kxh5,b'8/2p5/1p6/pPkP1P1K/q1P5/P2Q2P1/7P/8 b - -',43. Kxh5 - black is playing for a stalemate but alas for him it's his queen not his king that is stalemated!
25,0,25,Qxc4,b'8/8/1pP5/pPk2P1K/2q5/P2Q2P1/7P/8 w - -',43. .... Qxc4 - black finally decided to exchange queens but before I could take on c4 he hit the resign button!  After allowing my pawn to capture on c6 I can now get two queens on the board to nail the BK.  Black sees this and it is game over wheew and double wheeew!
26,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my first game in game knot.

102,2,59,Qg3#,b'8/8/6p1/3p1pP1/3PnP1K/6q1/1k6/8 w - -',...but he played it out to mate.
103,3,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This was my first game in a tournament in which I played OTB some 4 months ago. My opponent was considered much stronger than I as you can see from the ratings. Nevertheless I felt confident that I could put up a good fight since I was getting back in shape after a period of sloppy play and I always play well at that tournament (last year I had won the B-section so I was allowed to participate in the A-section this year). My opponent started off with 1.d4. Earlier in my chess career I was unhappy with that but now that I've discovered a nice opening against it that's not the case anymore.
104,3,1,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq b6',And there we are: the Benko Gambit. In the main line which we will see in this game Black gives up a pawn for nice open lines on the queenside and pressure on the weak White pawns. This game at least the first part will be instructive to see themes occurring often in the Benko Gambit.
105,3,2,bxa6,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/P4n2/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White accepts the pawn sacrifice and is now two pawns up for the moment (though a6 will fall of course). As compensation we can already see the open files Black gets.
106,3,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/P4np1/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Because of a certain 'refutation' this is considered better than the immediate recapture. As said a6 will fall anyway. The bishop belongs on g7 to put more pressure on the queenside.
107,3,4,e4,b'rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq e3',One of the main lines the other being 7.Nf3 with the idea of following up with g3 Bg2 and castling. In this line White gets to 'castle by hand'.
108,3,5,g3,b'rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1KNR b kq -',This is the idea: the king will hide on g2 allowing the rook to enter the free (after the knight has developed).
109,3,6,Nbd7,b'r2qk2r/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3P1/PP3PKP/R1BQ2NR w kq -',Apparently 10...O-O is the normal move order but I was not aware of that during the game (I still knew this line but had apparently memorised the moves in the wrong order). However I'm not sure if there's any difference actually.
110,3,7,1h3,b'r2qk2r/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3PP/PP3PK1/R1BQ2NR b kq -',Not the normal move here. It prevents 11...Ng4 with the plan of hopping to e5 to have a nice outpost. The normal move here is 11.Nf3 after which 11...Ng4 is not very popular but at move 12 (usually after 11...O-O) 12.h3 is one of the main moves. There are a lot of subtleties in the move order here but I don't know them exactly. Any Benko expert care to help me out? At least in this game it will all come down to a transposition. IN another game at this tournament against a 1800 player the opponent played 11.Ne2. I got crushed in 30 moves in a near-perfect game by my opponent I didn't even play badly there.
111,3,8,Rfb8,b'rr4k1/3nppbp/3p1np1/q1pP4/4P3/2N2NPP/PP3PK1/R1BQR3 w - -',Both sides pursue their own goals: White is developing normally and preparing an e5 push while Black is pressurising the queenside pawns with typical Benko development. The position here is a good example of the result of this opening and we're still well within opening theory.
112,3,9,1Qe2,b'rr4k1/3nppbp/3p1np1/q1pP4/4P3/2N2NPP/PP2QPK1/R1B1R3 b - -',This is a rare move. The idea is probably to further support the centre in preparation for an e5 push and maybe also to defend the 2nd rank b2 in particular. But as we'll see that last goal is not really achieved...
113,3,10,1Ne8,b'rr2n1k1/3nppbp/3p2p1/q1pP4/4P3/2N2NPP/PP2QPK1/R1B1R3 w - -',Opens up the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop. This is a typical Benko maneuvre: the knight is heading for b5 to exchange itself for the important defending knight on c3.
114,3,11,1Bg5,b'rr2n1k1/3nppbp/3p2p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/2N2NPP/PP2QPK1/R3R3 b - -',White probably thought he was able to move the bishop now that the queen is protecting b2 but this allows a nice tactic. I thought for more than 20 minutes before making my next move...
115,3,12,1Rxb2,b'r3n1k1/3nppbp/3p2p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/2N2NPP/Pr2QPK1/R3R3 w - -',! This wins back my gambit pawn. I hesitated because there was another way of winning back my pawn (taking twice on c3) and because I have to give up my strong bishop to regain the pawn but I thought my activity would compensate for that. The computer agrees with my assessment and views this as the best move.
116,3,13,Bxc3,b'r3n1k1/3npp1p/3p2p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/2b2NPP/PQ3PK1/R3R3 w - -',The point: I'm winning back the rook on a1.
117,3,14,Bxa1,b'r3n1k1/1Q1npp1p/3p2p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/5NPP/P4PK1/b3R3 w - -',I didn't really have to take the rook immediately but it doesn't matter much.
118,3,15,1Rxa1,b'r3n1k1/1Q1npp1p/3p2p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/5NPP/P4PK1/R7 b - -',White could also have taken the knight on d7 after which I'll have to exchange my dark-squared bishop anyway (18...Bf6 19.Bxf6 exf6) because otherwise e7 is hanging.
119,3,16,1Qa7,b'r3n1k1/qQ1npp1p/3p2p1/2pP2B1/4P3/5NPP/P4PK1/R7 w - -',This was actually forced all other moves lose material.
120,3,17,1Qb2,b'r3n1k1/q2npp1p/3p2p1/2pP2B1/4P3/5NPP/PQ3PK1/R7 b - -',White avoids the exchange of queens. Note that after 19.Qxa7 Rxa7 White can't take the pawn on e7 because after 20.Bxe7?? f6! the bishop is caught and can be taken by ...Kg8-f7xe7.
121,3,18,Nef6,b'1r4k1/q2npp1p/3p1np1/2pP2B1/4P3/2Q2NPP/P4PK1/R7 w - -',The knight was not doing anything useful on e8 anymore so it reactivates to f6. Black is now putting pressure on the White centre in particular the pawn on e4 while he still keeps an eye on the queenside as well.
122,3,19,Rb4,b'6k1/q2npp1p/3p1np1/2pP2B1/1r2P3/2Q3PP/P2N1PK1/R7 w - -',! Again very thematic. The rook is very active along the 4th rank and also attacks the pawn on e4.
123,3,20,Ra4,b'6k1/q2npp1p/3p1np1/2pP2B1/r3P3/P1Q3PP/3N1PK1/R7 w - -',I couldn't take on e4: 22...Nxe4?? 23.axb4! and I can take his queen but he can take mine: 23...Nxc3 24.Rxa7 and I've lost a rook. I could also have played 22...Rd4 here but I didn't like the fact that the rook would have no retreat along the same file and that it blocked the diagonal of the queen.
124,3,21,2f3,b'6k1/q2npp1p/3p1np1/2pP2B1/r3P3/P1Q2PPP/3N2K1/R7 b - -',Now that the rook is not under attack anymore e4 has to be defended.
125,3,22,2Qa6,b'6k1/3npp1p/q2p1np1/2pP2B1/r3P3/P1Q2PPP/3N2K1/R7 w - -',Very subtle: the queen is threatening checks on e2 and/or coming to d3 (not right now of course but with the help of a knight).
126,3,23,Ne5,b'6k1/4pp1p/q2p1np1/2pPn1B1/r3P3/P1Q2PPP/3N1K2/R7 w - -',I didn't mind if White would trade his bishop for my knight on f6 because it would strengthen the cover for my king and because my good knight would be left against his bad knight.
127,3,24,2Bh6,b'6k1/4pp1p/q2p1npB/2pPn3/r3P3/P1Q2PPP/3N1K2/R7 b - -',!? Cutting off the g7 square from the king. I didn't really notice the merits of this move until after my next move...
128,3,25,2Qd3,b'6k1/4pp1p/3p1npB/2pPn3/r3P3/P1Qq1PPP/3N1K2/R7 w - -',? Too enthusiastic. Better was to keep the queen on a6 so I can reply to 26.Rb1 by 26...Qa7. For example I can play 25...e6. Another suggestion of the computer is 25...Kh8 which I don't really understand.
129,3,26,2Rb1,b'6k1/4pp1p/3p1npB/2pPn3/r3P3/P1Qq1PPP/3N1K2/1R6 b - -',! Whoops didn't see that one. Now White surely gets the better of it.
130,3,27,2Nfd7,b'6k1/3npp1p/3p2pB/2pPn3/r3P3/P1Qq1PPP/3N1K2/1R6 w - -',?! Not best but the computer's suggestion is.. uhm.. not very attractive either: 26...Kh8 to be able to block the check 27.Rb8+ with the poor horse (27...Ng8)... That would surely not be accepted by the animal cops!
131,3,28,2Qb2,b'6k1/3npp1p/3p2pB/2pPn3/r3P3/P2q1PPP/1Q1N1K2/1R6 b - -',?! Fortunately for me White misses a chance to win material by force. It's a long line though and I'm not sure how strong a player you have to be to spot this. Anyway here we go: 27.Qxd3 Nxd3+ 28.Ke2 and if I play 28...N3e5? here white can win material by playing 29.f4 Nc4 30.Nxc4 Rxc4 31.Rb7 and the knight can't go away due to the mate threat. So better is 28...c4 but then I lose that pawn after 29.Nxc4 Rxc4 30.Kxd3. White's move is very natural as well and is also good but not as winning as the line suggested by Fritz.
132,3,29,2Qd4+,b'6k1/3npp1p/3p2pB/2pPn3/r2qP3/P4PPP/1Q1N1K2/1R6 w - -',! Black has to force the exchange of queens...
133,3,30,Rxd4,b'6k1/3npp1p/3p2pB/2pPn3/3rP3/P4PPP/3N1K2/1R6 w - -',? ... but retakes with the wrong piece. 28...cxd4 is by far the better capture though it weakens Black's pawn structure. This allows White once again to win material by force...
134,3,31,2Rb7,b'6k1/1R1npp1p/3p2pB/2pPn3/3rP3/P4PPP/3N1K2/8 b - -',Correct attacking the knight which can't move.
135,3,32,2f6,b'6k1/1R1np2p/3p1ppB/2pPn3/3rP3/P4PPP/3N1K2/8 w - -',to be able to play ...Nf7 after White plays f4 to attack the bishop so if White takes my knight I can take his bishop. Still there's a way for White to win material...
136,3,33,3Ra7,b'6k1/R2np2p/3p1ppB/2pPn3/3rP3/P4PPP/3N1K2/8 b - -',?! ... which he misses. I think this was the most obvious chance for White: 30.Be3 evacuating the bishop with tempo followed by 30...Ra4 31.f4 and Black loses a piece. As said the immediate 30.f4? doesn't work due to 30...Nf7.
137,3,34,3c4,b'6k1/R2np2p/3p1ppB/3Pn3/2prP3/P4PPP/3N1K2/8 w - -',?! Another tactical mistake the position is too complex for both of us. 30...g5 to stop f4 was necessary.
138,3,35,3Be3,b'6k1/R2np2p/3p1pp1/3Pn3/2prP3/P3BPPP/3N1K2/8 b - -',?! But White misses his last chance. 31.Ke3 is still winning. By the way there was no time trouble White had more than 45 minutes left while I had some 18 minutes on my clock.
139,3,36,c3,b'6k1/R2np2p/3p1pp1/3Pn3/4P3/P1prBPPP/3NK3/8 w - -',! Correct. Now 33.f4 won't work anymore since my pawn is too far advanced.
140,3,37,3Rxd7,b'6k1/3Rp2p/3p1pp1/3Pn3/4P3/PN1rBPPP/2p1K3/8 b - -',I had missed this one but we now exchange into an ending with R+B vs. R+N and 5 pawns each. White is still slightly better but no more than that. 34.Nc1 was the alternative after which a forced simplification to a rook ending follows: 34...Rd1 35.f4 Nc4 36.Rxd7 Nxe3 37.Kxe3 Rxc1 38.Kd2 Ra1 39.Kxc2 Rxa3 and this seems drawish as well. I think I saw that whole line over the board as well I remember seeing 38.Kd2 attacking rook and pawn but knowing I could take his a3 pawn as well. I was actually a bit disappointed during the game that my passed c-pawn didn't bring me more than this but analysing the game at home with my computer I found that there was nothing more to be gained from it: the pawn looked more menacing than it actually was.
141,3,38,3Rxb3,b'6k1/3Rp2p/3p1pp1/3Pn3/4P3/Pr2BPPP/2p1K3/8 w - -',Obviously not 34...Nxd7?? 35.Kxd3.
142,3,39,Ra8,b'r5k1/4p2p/3p1pp1/3Pn3/4P3/4BPPP/2R1K3/8 w - -',Here I was afraid that my opponent's rook would enter the last row but I should have played more actively. Now White still gains a bit of an edge. This was also a decision which I had to make under time pressure with about 10 minutes left on my clock.
143,3,40,Rd8,b'3r2k1/2Rnp2p/3p1pp1/3P4/4PP2/4B1PP/4K3/8 w - -',This way I keep my material and it's hard to see how to progress for White here.
144,3,41,e5,b'3r4/2Rn1k2/3p1ppp/3Pp3/3BPP1P/5KP1/8/8 w - e6',I was afraid White could make something happen on the long diagonal so I decided on this pawn push which also activates my king should White take e.p.. It does weaken my d-pawn but I thought I could easily solve that with a ...d5 move at some point.
145,3,42,4Rc6,b'3r4/3n4/2Rpkppp/8/3BPP1P/5KP1/8/8 b - -',Not the best try for an advantage I think but it's hard to suggest an alternative move.
146,3,43,4Nb8,b'1n1r4/8/2Rpkppp/8/3BPP1P/5KP1/8/8 w - -',"The computer gives 43...h5 with a score of 0.00 but now White's rook has to retreat or return back to c7 when I can repeat moves by 44...Nd7. Instead my opponent offered me a draw (without making a move but I didn't make a problem of that) and I was glad to accept it. Maybe he was tired since it was nearly 12 at night and he had travelled a long way to the playing venue that day and wanted to go to bed before the next round would start the next morning at 9. He said he thought he had a slight advantage but he couldn't work out how to make it count in time (he also had only 13 minutes left). Anyway this was the highest rating against which I ever managed to get half a point in an OTB game (except for a simul in which I beat an IM see another annotation of mine) and I was very pleased with that. In the tournament I eventually managed to score 2/6 with which I was quite happy given my rating but I also had thrown away two games like a child (missing a simple 'attack the pinned piece' and a knight fork) but overall I was satisfied with my performance.
I want to thank everybody for reading this annotation and my other annotations as well and hopefully you have learned something from my insights. I want to say I learned a lot from you as you can also see if you look at my rating curve on this site. Also I hope I can stay in touch with a few of you. Thank you for everything and farewell."

757,21,11,Nc6,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P1b1/2BP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',! Of course he also could have exchanged but this move is better because he is now continuing to develop.
758,21,12,O-O,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P1b1/2BP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Since I am slightly ahead in development I decide to take advantage by castling while the opportunity existed.  Like before however an exchange is just about to follow.
759,21,13,Nd4,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3nP3/2BP1B2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',So black is hoping for another exchange which he is about to get.
760,21,14,1Bg4,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP1B1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',At this point I am trying to figure out a way to get my Q out so that I can connect my rooks.
761,21,15,1g6,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/8/3pP1B1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',!? I don't know why he moved here but it's his first inaccuracy.  And it's quite risky.  First it's a non developing move since it's not a central pawn or minor piece.  Second for that reason it's not going to help him control the center.  Most importantly it will make it unsafe for him to castle Kingside. 
762,21,16,1Qf3,b'r2qk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/8/3pP1B1/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',! Therefore I take advantage by finally getting my Q out safely.  And now my rooks are connected at last.  The only reason why I still care about connected rooks is because Jack showed me how two rooks can be very dangerous when combined.
763,21,17,1Qf6,b'r3k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p1qp1/8/3pP1B1/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq -',Normally you should not bring the Q out before all of your pieces are developed.  But in one respect this is an exception because he will continue developing when we exchange.
764,21,18,1Bf3,b'r3k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3pP3/3P1B2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq -',After he took my LSB was attacked so I had no choice but to retreat it.
765,21,19,1O-O,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3pP3/3P1B2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - -',?! This move is quite risky.  I understand that it's important to castle and I almost always like to castle Kingside as opposed to Queenside.  And I am often stubborn about it and have on occasion gone wrong by castling short as opposed to short.  But even I realize that castling Queenside would have been much better because this move puts a whole around Ted's K.  In fact best was 14...0-0-0 in this position.  The reason being is that more often then not putting a whole around your K loses as it often leads to mate.
766,21,20,1Rae1,b'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3pP3/3P1B2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 b - -',In the meantime I decide to bring my rooks together because of what I mentioned earlier.
767,21,21,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3pP3/3P1B2/PPP2PPP/4RRK1 w - -',But so does he.  However better was 15...Rae8 because I learned from Jack Stockel that it is generally not a good idea to put your rooks on the same colors because it often leads to a bishop fork upon the rooks.  There are however exceptions but this is not one of them.
768,21,22,1c3,b'r3r1k1/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3pP3/2PP1B2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - -',In the meantime I decide to force an exchange by advancing my c pawn.
769,21,23,Re7,b'r5k1/ppp1rp1p/3p1np1/8/4P3/2PP1B2/P4PPP/4RRK1 w - -',?! I do not know why he made this move.  It does not accomplish anything.
770,21,24,1Reb1,b'r5k1/ppp1rp1p/3p1np1/8/4P3/2PP1B2/P4PPP/1R3RK1 b - -',So I decide to take advantage by attacking his b pawn.
771,21,25,1Rb8,b'1r4k1/ppp1rp1p/3p1np1/8/4P3/2PP1B2/P4PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',He also could have defended with 18...b2 but this move is just as good.
772,21,26,1Rfe1,b'1r4k1/ppp1rp1p/3p1np1/8/4P3/2PP1B2/P4PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',I played this move in order to put pressure on the e-file.  I also could have played 19.Rbe1 but this is better.  Why?  Because I would have been stressed with the other move.  I feel that moving the b rook will eventually make my a pawn vulnerable and that's a risk that I am not about to take.
773,21,27,1b6,b'1r4k1/p1p1rp1p/1p1p1np1/8/4P3/2PP1B2/P4PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',I understand that he is trying to connect his pawns.
774,21,28,2a4,b'1r4k1/p1p1rp1p/1p1p1np1/8/P3P3/2PP1B2/5PPP/1R2R1K1 b - a3',"But I am not about to let my a pawn hang.  Of course I could have played 20.Ra1 but then 20...Ra8.  So I would still feel pressured for the same reason.  This prevents any ""Fight or Flight"" that pawn will be attacked.  Afterall as my coach used to always say ""Don't get nervous"" and that has been one of my main weaknesses until recently.  That's because I now think of certain moves way ahead so that I never get into a situation where all I feel is anxious.  Here's the thing in a different annotation cdeburca told me that I tend to exaggerate my understanding of positions.  In reality however I used to underestimate it.  It's amazing that I know a lot more information then I thought.  So all you have to do is feel confident that's really the solution to a lot of problems."
775,21,29,2Rbe8,b'4r1k1/p1p1rp1p/1p1p1np1/8/P3P3/2PP1B2/5PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',Of course that is not going to stop him from bringing his Rooks.  BTW this is what is meant when I talk about two rooks being dangerous.  Although I'm not nervous I have to be careful because of the one time that Jack mated me despite me winning his Q.  And that was because he had a very similar position to this where both of his rooks were connected.
776,21,30,2d4,b'4r1k1/p1p1rp1p/1p1p1np1/8/P2PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',?! Therefore I respond with this move but better was actually 21.Rb5 allowing white to double the rooks especially if then 22.Rb5 and 23.Rb1. In this case I was just thinking about exchanging pawns and what you have you.  So what's the point of this move then.  Now my e pawn has less protection since I just advanced the d pawn.  Therefore this move is pointless and that's why I marked it as dubious.  
777,21,31,2Nd7,b'4r1k1/p1pnrp1p/1p1p2p1/8/P2PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/1R2R1K1 w - -',! He sees that I am eventually going to attack his N so he retreats and in a very good spot.  At least it's not in a different place where it would get or attacked or on the rim.  This proves that my opponent is also thinking ahead and not move by move.  
778,21,32,2a5,b'4r1k1/p1pnrp1p/1p1p2p1/P7/3PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/1R2R1K1 b - -',! At this point I decide to give away a pawn or do I?  Well as it turns out this is not a free pawn but a gambit as we will see later on.  And it is not a true gambit.  As it turns out I got this idea from something completely different and that is QGA.  Because I am going to get a pawn back.
779,21,33,2Rb7,b'4r1k1/pRpnrp1p/3p2p1/p7/3PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/4R1K1 b - -',That's because of this move.  
780,21,34,2Nb6,b'4r1k1/pRp1rp1p/1n1p2p1/p7/3PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I don't know why he moved there.
781,21,35,2Rxa7,b'4r1k1/R1p1rp1p/1n1p2p1/p7/3PP3/2P2B2/5PPP/4R1K1 b - -',But that does not stop me from recapturing as noted earlier.  Afterall that's why 22.a5 was not a true gambit and it also how I was able to apply the same concept that you would see in the QG.  The only exception is that the position is completely.  But an important moral to learn is that sometimes you can apply the same concept even in a different position.  Why?  Because concepts=ideas and ideas are powerful tools as I learned in college.
782,21,36,2Nc4,b'4r1k1/R1p1rp1p/3p2p1/p7/2nPP3/2P2B2/5PPP/4R1K1 w - -',I just figured out what he is trying to do.  In this position he wants to exchange my LSB for his N but that's not his main.  Why?  If I accept the exchange my K will become exposed but I am not going to allow that.  It just shows what I really know so it proves that I am extremely intelligent. 
783,21,37,Re7xe4,b'4r1k1/R1p2p1p/3p2p1/p7/2nPr3/2P5/4BPPP/4R1K1 w - -',So he captures my pawn but that does not affect me in anyway.
784,21,38,2f3,b'4r1k1/R1p2p1p/3p2p1/p7/2nPr3/2P2P2/4B1PP/4R1K1 b - -',I had several different options.  At first I thought that this was best but I just took another at the board.  Only now do I realize that best was actually 26.Bd3 forking his N and e Rook.  At the very least I would have won his R for my LSB.  What did I forget?  To look at the entire board.  Of course this time I had a very good reason for failing to do so.  As mentioned in the intro I was not at my optimal best because I was still recovering from being jet lagged and it had been a long while since my previous games.  For me one week of not playing chess is long enough and it would be the absolute threshold (just long enough) for me to start some of the important concepts.  So it's a miracle that I was up to resuming my chess on that particular day.  In this position I was thinking to myself that I would kick his rook so that it would be forced be move.  That way I would be guaranteed to win back a pawn.  In this case his a5 or c7 pawn.  That will happen but that is when I am going to make a blunder that will ultimately seal my fate as we will shortly. 
785,21,39,2Nd2,b'4r1k1/R1p2p1p/3p2p1/p7/3Pr3/2P2P2/3nB1PP/4R1K1 w - -',?? This was actually a blunder that should have lost the game but I did not see it until it was too little and too late.  I simply thought good now I can win what I had essentially lost.  However I could have something worth a lot more which would have ended the game in victory.  What was it?  
786,21,40,2Rxc7,b'4r1k1/2R2p1p/3p2p1/p7/3Pr3/2P2P2/3nB1PP/4R1K1 b - -',?? In this position my only goal was to get a pawn back.  However I did not realize that I could have won his R until now.  So this is the losing blunder because this move loses a piece when we exchange.  And there will be no compensation for it.  Best was 27.fxe4! winning his e R for my f pawn.  In fact that would have been the winning move.  Therefore it's ironic that what should have won actually loses.
787,21,41,2Ra7,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/3nr1PP/6K1 b - -',At this point I am trying to get partial compensation at the very least.  That's because I am attempting to win his a pawn but I am not going to be successful as noted earlier.
788,21,42,2Re1+,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/3n2PP/4r1K1 w - -',For one thing he responds to my attack by placing me in check.
789,21,43,3Kf2,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/3n1KPP/4r3 b - -',Forced.
790,21,44,3Ra1,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/3n1KPP/r7 w - -',After I get out of it he protects a5 with his R
791,21,45,3Ke2,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/3nK1PP/r7 b - -',That however does not stop me from attacking my N.  Just because my opponent has a winning edge does not mean that I am immediately going to resign.  Although it's unusual once in a while you can pull a swindle and get an advantage of what should be with best play.  Of course that is not going to happen in this game but it's always worth a try.  
792,21,46,3Ra2,b'6k1/R4p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/r2nK1PP/8 w - -',Instead of retreating he protects with his R.
793,21,47,3Ra8+,b'R5k1/5p1p/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/r2nK1PP/8 b - -',This time I decide to place him in check because I am trying to make him feel stressed so that he makes a mistake that would allow me to get a swindle.  Unfortunately that is not going but there were one or two occasions where my position was dead.  But I stressed my opponent enough to make a combat and pull a win.
794,21,48,3Kg7,b'R7/5pkp/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/r2nK1PP/8 w - -',Forced.
795,21,49,3Rd8,b'3R4/5pkp/3p2p1/p7/3P4/2P2P2/r2nK1PP/8 b - -',But this was the logic behind 32.Ra8+.  That's right in this position I am attacking his d pawn.  And I actually thought that he had no way protect.  On the other hand I was wrong and am once again not going to be successful in achieving my goal.  That's because I miscalculated something important.  He has a way to protect it but that is the only thing that I don't like about thinking more then one step ahead.  It risks and sometimes causes miscalculation and this is a good example.  However thinking ahead is important in chess and in life as I mentioned in a different annotation. 
796,21,50,3Nc4+,b'3R4/5pkp/3p2p1/p7/2nP4/2P2P2/r3K1PP/8 w - -',So he protects by placing me in a discovered check.  In addition this move protects his d pawn in addition to his a pawn in the short and long term.  At this point I am almost completely hopeless but I am not going resign yet.  Remember: I always like to stay positive.
797,21,51,3Ke1,b'3R4/5pkp/3p2p1/p7/2nP4/2P2P2/r5PP/4K3 b - -',"So I get out of it by moving my K back.  By doing so I figured that I don't have to worry about any more ""King Checks"".  However I realize that he could continue to put me in check at this point.  Although this will be his last time it's only the beginning of my problems.  What he has in store is much worse as we will see later on."
798,21,52,3a4,b'3R4/5pkp/3p2p1/8/p1nP4/2P2P2/r5PP/4K3 w - -',In this position he is trying to get a passed pawn but I am not going to allow that.
799,21,53,3Rc8,b'2R5/5pkp/3p2p1/8/p1nP4/2P2P2/r5PP/4K3 b - -',So I start by kicking his N.
800,21,54,3d5,b'2R5/5pkp/6p1/3p4/p1nP4/2P2P2/r5PP/4K3 w - -',! I actually thought that he would retreat but this move is even better.
801,21,55,3Rd8,b'3R4/5pkp/6p1/3p4/p1nP4/2P2P2/r5PP/4K3 b - -',Now my attitude towards him is that if he can get a passed pawn I will take a different pawn and work my way to where he is trying to accomplish his goal.  Normally I would not have this attitude but I have nothing else to lose.  In fact I will eventually resign so anything is better then nothing.  It just shows improvement in my games.
802,21,56,3Ne3,b'3R4/5pkp/6p1/3p4/p2P4/2P1nP2/r5PP/4K3 w - -',However he finds a way to protect his pawn but what I did was still worth a try.
803,21,57,3Rd7,b'8/3R1pkp/6p1/3p4/p2P4/2P1nP2/r5PP/4K3 b - -',So I just go for by putting pressure on the f file.  At first I thought that I had successfully attacked or pinned his pawn but he can just get out of it if he moves his K to g8 or f8.
804,21,58,3Rxg2,b'8/3R1pkp/6p1/3p4/p2P4/2P1nP2/6rP/4K3 w - -',! But this move is much better because he gets another free pawn.  At this point I have no choice to give up at least two more pawns to avoid an unavoidable mate.  Therefore I resigned at this point. 
805,22,0,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The Chigorin defense- Black blocks his c pawn and relies on other methods to attack white's center like Bg4 and maybe e5.
806,22,1,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The most popular move although Nf3 is also very common.  Now cxd5 is a threat.
807,22,2,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black develops and defends d5.
808,22,3,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',And White brings out the other knight.  This helps defend d4 in case of dxc4 by Black.

811,22,6,Nxd5,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Black recaptures the pawn and puts pressure on the c3 knight.
812,22,7,e4,b'r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq e3',And white grabs the center.  Black has no choice but to exchange some of White's pieces.

And so to the first attempt by the Caissa team to play an annotated training game. We've decided to play an unrated game 5 days a move with dsb13 as White because josetborda2 would like to practice his Black repertoire. We can (and will try) to annotate as we go along saving the annotations so that people can read them. It'll be just like Mastergame (which anybody who isn't (a) 40+ and (b) British might not understand as a joke). I'll explain later.
If anyone else wants to jump in with annotations please feel free to do so but can you wait until we're 5 moves down the line so as not to spoil our game? Cheers David

dsb13's comments to white first move.
Right then. 1. e4. A classic opening grabbing a share of the centre and opening lines for the Bf1 and Qd1.

White plays the Vienna Game. The plan is to play f4 in the manner of the King's Gambit without letting Black play exf4 and d5 equalising. White is trying to develop and maintain some tension in the position with this move. He can if he wants look to play g3 Bg2 and Nge2 as a system of development or even look to play d4.
I've been playing this for some time and prefer it to 2. Nf3 which is probably objectively the strongest move in this position. It takes Black out of his book a little and avoids the Petroff (2. Nf3 Nf6) Philidor (2. Nf3 d6) and Latvian (2. Nf3 f5).

It's not that f6 belongs to the knight (which is going to g6) but it's going to make 0-0 impossible without kicking the Bc4 off the a2-g8 diagonal and it weakens the h5-e8 diagonal too. White has 3 genuine options here - 4.f4 4.Nf3 and 4.d4. 4.f4 is interesting. The threat is not just fxe5 but also to push for g2-g4-g5 as part of the attack. In those circumstances White will play d3 and either Nge3-g3 or Nf3.

It is very frequently the case that Black is interested in exchanging his light-square bishop (LSB) for the knight at f3 removing one of the supports for White's e-pawn's progress to e5 but also leaving whatever recaptures on f3 none-too-conveniently placed for White.

Although objectively White might even have the whisker of an edge here and there was a distinct chance that all I would have taken is a scenic route to a draw yet I just felt that this was going to be ... fun.  It has to be said though: it was touch and go whether I would get much of anything.

Although GK gives White a +0.67 at the end of this line the thing looks very drawish to me.  Incidentally 28...g4 seems to lead only to a transposition of movesm after 29.Bxg4; and if White tries 32.Rxb7ch Kf6  33.Rb6 Rfd8  34.Kg3 Kxf5 this rook ending looks drawish as well.

He can if he wants look to play g3 Bg2 and Nge2 as a system of development or even look to play d4.
I've been playing this for some time and prefer it to 2. Nf3 which is probably objectively the strongest move in this position.  It takes Black out of his book a little and avoids the Petroff (2. Nf3 Nf6) Philidor (2. Nf3 d6) and Latvian (2. Nf3 f5).

It's not that f6 belongs to the knight (which is going to g6) but it's going to make 0-0 impossible without kicking the Bc4 off the a2-g8 diagonal and it weakens the h5-e8 diagonal too. White has 3 genuine options here - 4.f4 4.Nf3 and 4.d4.  4.f4 is interesting. The threat is not just fxe5 but also to push for g2-g4-g5 as part of the attack. In those circumstances White will play d3 and either Nge3-g3 or Nf3.

I hope/calculate White will either go into preparation for 0-0 or f5.  Perhaps he'll play 7.g3?  Anything else I can see would mean too much of a loss for White. 
DSB: Black underestimates White's lead in development. If exf4 I'm happy to play d4.  If Black wants to hold the f4 pawn with g5 White has a Muzio Gambit idea with the potential of playing e5 hitting f6 and opening up the potential of Qh5+ or an assault down the f-file."

1059,32,4,Bc4,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Book Bc4 it appears white is playing the Italian game opening putting pressure on the weak f6 square. 
1060,32,5,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',e6. I chose to play e6 to prevent kf6-combination attack and to also open diagonal for future bishop development. 
1061,32,6,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',kc3. White plays book Nc6 development threatening the d5 and b5 squares respectively. 
1062,32,7,a6,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',book a6. This move is in preparation to develop Nc6 without having to worry about being the king being pinned by Bb5 should white choose. Also preparing to force the white bishop to retreat off the positionally valuable long diagonal facing my weak f7 pawn. 
1063,32,8,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq d3',d4. White plays book d4- thrust to the center in attempt to take the center of the board. 
1064,32,9,b5,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq b6',I played b5 to attack the white bishop and force him off the valuable long diagonal. This also prepares me to develop bishop b7 to attack white square g2 expecting white to castle king side. 
1065,32,10,Be2,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -',White retreats bishop to e2 fearing being kicked again if my response would be c4 as opposed to cxd4. Other options lead the white bishop to a trap if b3 and nulls all previous development and prohibits king side castling if f1
1066,32,11,cxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',cxd4. I chose cxd4 to disrupt whites strong central position and to potentially open new future attack lanes specifically placing the black queen on either b6 or c7 if the opportunity presents itself.  
1067,32,12,Qxd4,b'rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Qxd4.This move I feel was a mistake and set the president for the failures of white in this game. I believe that white wanted to start out on an aggressive footing. Taking d4 with the queen technically stymies the development of the black bishop ex: if Be7 then QxG7 - BF6. I may be one pawn down material but I would have no viable place to castle and it would be a loosing game . Other reasons for this move I believe is to add pressure to the weak pawn on d6 by future castling and preparing to move rd1. This would become a liability to me and would make development difficult. 
1068,32,13,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1npp3/1p6/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Nc6. Simple development move that fulfills multiple purposes e6 d4 b4 and a5 are now controlled by black and now while is forced to retreat the queen back to a square that is not a grave threat to the future of blacks king side safety g7.  Most importantly this simple move has shifted the initiative from white to black which is especially not good when white is trying to aggressively take position. 
1069,32,14,Qd2,b'r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1npp3/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq -',Qd2. Queen moves back to d2 still hoping to overpower the weak pawn on the d file in the future. This square also allows the white queen to get into action with my king side if an opportunity presents itself. All in all probably the best possible response to the threat of my knight. 
1070,32,15,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq -',Nf6. Simple development move kf6 attempting to prepare for castling and wanting to take further control of the wavering white center. 
1071,32,16,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',O-O While castles king side The obvious choice for white who wants to get king side safety along with the ability to move rd6 in the future should it prove viable. 
1072,32,17,Be7,b'r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq -',Be7. Simple development move enabling king side castling and preventing a potential pin that may hamper future development. 
1073,32,18,1Qg5,b'r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p4Q1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq -',Qg5. Knowing that I will not play kxe4 white plays aggressive move Qg5 threatening blacks weak spot square g7. This also puts the queen in a prime place to attack once castling happens by controlling the g file whilst hoping in the future to play Bh6 for an extreme threat to black. 
1074,32,19,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p4Q1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',O-O. the only good move on the board. Playing g6 would protect this vulnerable pawn but the response would be Qh6. This would cut off the king on the diagonal  and prevent  castling whilst making a much weaker position overall. 
1075,32,20,1Qe3,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N1QN2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qe3. In over his head white pulls his queen back to a square that is against the strategy I believe white wanted to use. While Qg3 may have been a good way to maintain the strategy it would be a grave error. If Qg3- e4 (Bh6 threatening mate in one) Black then plays sneaky move Kh5 filling a multipurpose of attacking the while queen and protecting the square g5 that the white queen is threatening mate on.  The white queen would be trapped and it would be a certain win for black.  Moving anywhere else diminishes the move already made and will result in a positional loss. 
1076,32,21,1Ng4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1npp3/1p6/4P1n1/2N1QN2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Ng4. coining the phrase bullying the queen black attacks this strong yet ironically extremely weak piece in order to gain initiative and to dissuade her from pursuing her potentially dangerous attack. Black hopes and believes given the aggressive play style of white that the response will be Qf4 as this will result in a net position gain for black. 
1077,32,22,1Qf4,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1npp3/1p6/4PQn1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qf4. Unwilling to give up the relentless attack The white queen returns to a safe square on the kings side threatening d6 and f7 and the knight on g4. 
1078,32,23,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np4/1p2p3/4PQn1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',e5. Black's response is a multifaceted one.The queen is attacked by a defended pawn while the knight is benefited by a discovered defense from the blacks white bishop on c8
1079,32,24,1Qd2,b'r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np4/1p2p3/4P1n1/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qd2. Deciding to finally give up on the futile attack and to focus yet again on the recently weakened d6 square the white queen wisely retreats back to d2. 
1080,32,25,1h6,b'r1bq1rk1/4bpp1/p1np3p/1p2p3/4P1n1/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',h6. this move is a in between move designed to facilitate an attack on the queen bishop pair and to prevent Nf5. 
1081,32,26,1Qd5,b'r1bq1rk1/4bpp1/p1np3p/1p1Qp3/4P1n1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qd5. seeing opportunity to attack white yet again brings the queen forward to attack unsupported. he is pinning an undefended rook and threatening an undefended knight on C6. Nd5 would have been better threatening capture of the bishop on e7 and thus making the pawn on d6 even weaker. This is one of the more costly mistakes of the game. 
1082,32,27,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1np3p/1p1Qp3/4P1n1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',Bb7. move to protect the knight and break the pin off the rook Bb7 also x-rays onto weak white pawn on e4. 
1083,32,28,1h3,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1np3p/1p1Qp3/4P1n1/2N2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',h3. Wishing the black knight gone white kicks him back. 
1084,32,29,1Nf6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p1Qp3/4P3/2N2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Nf6 obvious move kicking the queen out of her place yet again and preventing future powerful Nd5. 
1085,32,30,1Qb3,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/4P3/1QN2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qb3. unwilling to abandon the attack again queen pulls back to b3 to maintain attack on f7 square. 
1086,32,31,1Na5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p2p1n1p/np2p3/4P3/1QN2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Na5. following the game theme black harasses the queen further opening attack lanes on e4 and hoping to trap the queen. 
1087,32,32,1Qa3,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p2p1n1p/np2p3/4P3/Q1N2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Qa3. The only safe move any other move would result in the loss in of the queen. 
1088,32,33,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p4n1p/np1pp3/4P3/Q1N2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',d4. discovered attack on the queen by the black bishop causing a very nice *almost foolproof queen trap*
1089,32,34,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p4n1p/np1pp3/1P2P3/Q1N2N1P/P1P1BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - b3',b3. a non ideal situation white is forced to move his pawn forward to block the discovered attack by the black bishop. This move also has the virtue of attacking the black knight. 
1090,32,35,1Nc4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p4n1p/1p1pp3/1Pn1P3/Q1N2N1P/P1P1BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Nc4. Following suit yet again black attacks queen on a3.

1092,32,37,1dxc4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p4n1p/1p2p3/1Pp1P3/Q1N2N1P/P1P2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',dxc4. Pawn retakes opening up attack on e4. This ends the queen attack. She is isolated and essentially useless the rest of the game. A huge disadvantage for white. 
1093,32,38,2Nxe5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2bpp1/p4n1p/1p2N3/1Pp1P3/Q1N4P/P1P2PP1/R1B2RK1 b - -',Nxe5. choosing aggression over defense white captures the free pawn on e5.

1096,32,41,2Bxe4,b'r2q1rk1/4bpp1/p6p/1p2N3/1Pp1b3/Q6P/P1P2PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Bxe4. Exchange completed attack on g2 maintained.

This however is not a good move as it puts the queen in a position that is even more useless and hard to get out of. 
1098,32,43,2Bf6,b'r2q1rk1/5pp1/p4b1p/1p2N3/1Pp1b3/Q1P4P/P4PP1/R1B2RK1 w - -',Bf6. Wishing to remove the black knight bishop challenges.

1100,32,45,2Qc7,b'r4rk1/2q2pp1/p4b1p/1p2N3/1Pp1bB2/Q1P4P/P4PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Qc7. This non intuitive move at first glance appears to be a grave mistake. it leaves a rook hanging from white response kg6. In looking at the end of the game this plays out to be the best move in the game that opens a truly brutal attack that either ends in checkmate or a crippling material deficit for white. 
1101,32,46,2Ng6,b'r4rk1/2q2pp1/p4bNp/1p6/1Pp1bB2/Q1P4P/P4PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Nf6. Seeing the opportunity for free material white plays move Nf6 opening the black queen to discovered attack from the bishop and threatening the rook. 
1102,32,47,2Qb7,b'r4rk1/1q3pp1/p4bNp/1p6/1Pp1bB2/Q1P4P/P4PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Qb7. This move prepares to attack the vulnerable king side square g2 for the killing blow. 
1103,32,48,2Nxf8,b'r4Nk1/1q3pp1/p4b1p/1p6/1Pp1bB2/Q1P4P/P4PP1/R4RK1 b - -',Nxf8. Shrugging off the attack on g5 the knight decides to capture the rook. A mistake e3 f3 would have disrupted the attack and would have ended in a one pawn loss for white only. 
1104,32,49,2Bxg2,b'r4Nk1/1q3pp1/p4b1p/1p6/1Pp2B2/Q1P4P/P4Pb1/R4RK1 w - -',Bxg2. This move attacks the rook on f1 but also threatens a pull through for the queen later on. At this point white can still bow out for a one point material disadvantage but the damage to the position is irreparable. 
1105,32,50,2Nh7,b'r5k1/1q3ppN/p4b1p/1p6/1Pp2B2/Q1P4P/P4Pb1/R4RK1 b - -',Nh7. assuming the knight to be lost white plays Nh7 forcing a response in order to give white an opportunity to withdraw from his position.  playing Nd6 looks like a favorable square except that the response Bh4 which would put additional pressure on whites position where any attempt to save the rook would  lead to checkmate. 
1106,32,51,2Kxh7,b'r7/1q3ppk/p4b1p/1p6/1Pp2B2/Q1P4P/P4Pb1/R4RK1 w - -',Kxh7. This knight is a freebee piece. Knowing that if he isn't taken Kxf6+ would be the result. The knight is taken because any attempt to early force a checkmate can be thwarted by f3 and this would result in a material loss. 
1107,32,52,2Rfe1,b'r7/1q3ppk/p4b1p/1p6/1Pp2B2/Q1P4P/P4Pb1/R3R1K1 b - -',Re1. Not wishing to loose the rook and maintain a material advantage white deigns to move his rook to safer ground. This unfortunately turns out to be a serious error and will cost him the game.

White moves back to D2 in order to stop the rook on e1 from being captured and mate being forced. at this point the game is resigned by white. The mistakes in this game on whites part were made mostly in over aggressiveness and failure to support the white queen. She was pushed to a part of the board where she was not utilized for a full 15 moves while with each push more and more of the board is ceded to black.  The few chances for legitimate attack for white were forfeited by misusing the strongest parts of the queens power and having the weakness of the queen thoroughly exploited by black. It is important to note that while the queen is incredibly powerful she is also incredibly weak while all pieces (opposing queens excepted can if supported force a queen from her position. It is for this reason it is unwise to bring her out unless fully supported. For curiosity's sake I included the mate sequence.

1128,33,5,Bf5,b'rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pb2/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Bc5 is because if I decide to play Nb6 it gives my opponent the chance to play Bg5 which means I must play Qd7 which will trap my Bishop and ruin what attack i may muster for a few moves (by then my opponent could force me to defend).

White can respond with Qxf3 or gxf3 but that gives me my pawn back on e5. Qxf3 is the better move.
