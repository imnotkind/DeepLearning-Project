0,0,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"""A logical and sound move to start the game grabbing central space and opening lines for quick developement of the Bf1 and queen. Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players there is always 1. Nf3 controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure. ""
Morphy one and only true love his confidence never wavered with the best move ""best by Test"" Bobby Fischer. "
1,0,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is so White can't create a huge pawn centre unnopposed.
2,0,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',"Developing a knight to its best square attacking the pawn 
controlling two center squares."
3,0,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',"The best move to defend. Also attacks two squares and develops 
a piece."
4,0,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?
5,0,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. Moprhy now has the chance to play his and my fave as I have already mentioned the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?
6,0,6,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',"This the move that signals the beginning of the Evans.  White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside Initiative with a quick attack on the Black king which will hopefully end in mate. Most  gambits like these give White an early initiative however  if Black can defend accurately he stands better in the ensuing endgame with plenty of chances for a win. When people tell me this I simply reply "" I don't give a crap I don't plan letting Black get into an endgame position anyway. Lol."""
7,0,7,Bxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative. This is atleast what Black  is meant to try and do!
8,0,8,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre. 
9,0,9,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Retreating to a powerful square that won't be his for long because of the oncoming 6.d4! Better would have been 5... Ba5
10,0,10,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',Grabbing the pawn center unleashing the dark squared bishop and attacking the c5 bishop all with one move. Remember the best moves accomplish multiple goals or hit multiple targets
11,0,11,exd4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An exchange in the centre.
12,0,12,Bb6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Keeping the pressure on the d-pawn. However it is obvios that White has the edge in this positiion.
13,0,13,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',"Castliing is not only a defensive move but also an offensive move. Notice that now the f rook is in the game and surely will be moving to the powerful and 
open e-file soon."
14,0,14,Na5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1b6/n7/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Moving the knight to an inferior square where it no longer attacks the center.
15,0,15,Bd3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1b6/n7/3PP3/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Not wanting to trade that good bishop for that half-knight stranded passively on the side of the board where it will find it hard to affect the game.
16,0,16,d5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2p4/3PP3/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6',With the bishop gone black is able to challenge white's awesome pawn center. Not a bad idea although flawed because it gives Paul the opportunity to open the e-file.
17,0,17,1exd5,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2P4/3P4/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Luring the queen out early. Not good for Paul's Dad!
18,0,18,1Qxd5,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2q4/3P4/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Bringing the queen out early is very dangerous because white can attack it with his developing pieces there are no other options though if he wants to regain the material deficit.
19,0,19,1Ba3,b'r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2q4/3P4/B2B1N2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',Developing the bishop to a powerful square where it will prevent black from castling pressure the critical squares around the king and pin the king to the middle of the board sometimes in the Evan's Gambit Black play the pawn move d7-d8 but oh woops Blacks excanged all his central pawns while his King is stuck in the centre.
20,0,20,1Be6,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b2b3/n2q4/3P4/B2B1N2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',White finds it necessary to block the critical e-file since it is obvious white rook will be coming to town with R-e1.
21,0,21,1Nc3,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b2b3/n2q4/3P4/B1NB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',! White develops with a threat!
22,0,22,1Qd7,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/1b2b3/n7/3P4/B1NB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black does not go all the way back because he hopes to castle queenside since castling kingside is out of the question because of the a3 bishop.
23,0,23,1d5,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/1b2b3/n2P4/8/B1NB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',A pawn sacrifice which clears the e-file for an attack on the king.
24,0,24,1Bxd5,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/1b6/n2b4/8/B1NB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Black accepts the 'free' pawn.
25,0,25,1Nxd5,b'r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/1b6/n2N4/8/B2B1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',White wants to trade this bishop off because it is black's critical defender.
26,0,26,1Bb5+,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/nB1q4/8/B4N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',! A piece sacrifice typical Morphy! The reason for this move is to clear the d-file for white's queen so the king can't run out of the center.
27,0,27,1Qxb5,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/nq6/8/B4N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',Notice that black had no other option without losing the queen. Do you see why?
28,0,28,1Re1+,b'r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/nq6/8/B4N2/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',Finally the file grabbing move!
29,0,29,1Ne7,b'r3k2r/ppp1nppp/1b6/nq6/8/B4N2/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',Another file grabbing move. 
30,0,30,1Rxe7+,b'r3k2r/ppp1Rppp/qb6/n7/8/B4N2/P4PPP/1R1Q2K1 b kq -',Here comes the powerful blow....
31,0,31,1Qd5,b'r4k1r/ppp1Rppp/qb6/n2Q4/8/B4N2/P4PPP/1R4K1 b - -',Threatening checkmate.

33,0,33,2Rf8#,b'r4Rkr/ppp3pp/1b6/n2Q4/2q5/B4N2/P4PPP/1R4K1 b - -',"CHECK AND MATE! This shows Morphy was always was a big one for development( just look at all the other games by Morphy I have annotated.!). Perhaps the first chess player to stress the need to develop before you attack... He just simply annihilated all the competition in his time. I believe that he was the greatest player of all time his genius goes along with Capablanca Alekhine Fischer and Tal. I hope you liked this game. I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why leave a comment or PM.

34,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Hello everybody :) This time I would like to present a game played against my buddy vkoval in which I will demonstrate how important it is to fully develop all of your pieces in the game. So let's move on - hope you enjoy it!
35,1,1,e6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"I usually start with an ""open"" opening and this is a typical move my opponent is used to make against 1. e4."
36,1,2,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Moving on to French Defence which is one of my most hated openings. I always seem to fall into trouble in this one.
37,1,3,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6',Typical play by black. I usually play 3. e5 to avoid the exchange variation in which I do not see any good attacking possibilities.
38,1,4,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',As said.
39,1,5,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Again a typical move.
40,1,6,c3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Secures d4.
41,1,7,Qb6,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This move prevents white from activating it's bishop since b2 is under attack.
42,1,8,Nf3,b'rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',As far everything according to the book. I was expecting 5. ... Nc6 however my opponent played differently.
43,1,9,Ne7,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2nppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',After this move I can develop my light-squared bishop. If vkoval had played 5. ... Nc6 this would not be possible since the d4 pawn would be left unguarded.
44,1,10,Bd3,b'rnb1kb1r/pp2nppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This move also prevents 6. ... Nf5.
45,1,11,Nec6,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',What? Wasn't d8-d6 a better way to develop? I think so and now black has lost a tempo and blocked the c6 square with his other knight.
46,1,12,Bc2,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Clears the path for the Queen to guard the d4 pawn. Also places the bishop strategically on a fully opened b1-h7 diagonal.
47,1,13,Nd7,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Hmm... This move brings the second knight into play but blocks the path for the bishop as well. Morover is there any place this knight could move on with the next move? Only to its origin square I guess.
48,1,14,O-O,b'r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Castling brings the rook into play. My opponent is at least two moves from making a castle.
49,1,15,Be7,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',He prepares for it nevertheless.
50,1,16,b3,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/1PP2N2/P1B2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',This move unblocks white's dark squared bishop. It can now take an active spot on b2 or the c1-h6 diagonal.
51,1,17,f6,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nb1pp/1qn1pp2/2ppP3/3P4/1PP2N2/P1B2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Purpose of this move by black is to bring the d7 knight into the game.
52,1,18,1exf6,b'r1b1k2r/pp1nb1pp/1qn1pP2/2pp4/3P4/1PP2N2/P1B2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White takes otherwise the center is lost.
53,1,19,1Nxf6,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/2pp4/3P4/1PP2N2/P1B2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Knight retakes and takes a good defensive spot.
54,1,20,1Bb2,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/2pp4/3P4/1PP2N2/PBB2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',The bishop goes to b2 to secure the c3 and d4 pawns.
55,1,21,1c4,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/3p4/2pP4/1PP2N2/PBB2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Hmm... again. This move doesn't bring much into black's position. White cannot take the pawn because of an unguarded bishop at b2. So another piece is developed to attack the c4 pawn and force an exchange!
56,1,22,1Nbd2,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/3p4/2pP4/1PP2N2/PBBN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',The second knight is developed.
57,1,23,1Na5,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/n2p4/2pP4/1PP2N2/PBBN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',This may look as a good move but it has certain drawbacks. Notice how poorly black's pieces are developed on the queenside. Two of them are still on their starting spots and the queen and the knight are being placed away from the center and play a rather defensive role.
58,1,24,1Rb1,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/n2p4/2pP4/1PP2N2/PBBN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',The rook comes to the rescue giving a safety net for the dark-squared bishop guarding b3 and attacking the queen.
59,1,25,1cxb3,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/n2p4/3P4/1pP2N2/PBBN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black trades the pawn.
60,1,26,1axb3,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/n2p4/3P4/1PP2N2/1BBN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq -',White retakes creating a strong pawn-chain on the queenside together with heavy guarding force behind it.
61,1,27,1Nc6,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/3p4/3P4/1PP2N2/1BBN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq -',Black's knight retreats. This move looses another tempo and doesn't bring any good for black's development.
62,1,28,1Re1,b'r1b1k2r/pp2b1pp/1qn1pn2/3p4/3P4/1PP2N2/1BBN1PPP/1R1QR1K1 b kq -',The second rook takes an active spot on the half-opened e-line. It also attacks the weakest black's pawn on e6.
63,1,29,1Nd8,b'r1bnk2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/3p4/3P4/1PP2N2/1BBN1PPP/1R1QR1K1 w kq -',The knight increaes protection of the pawn but look how far from the center black has to defend itself.
64,1,30,1h3,b'r1bnk2r/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/3p4/3P4/1PP2N1P/1BBN1PP1/1R1QR1K1 b kq -',Defensive move preventing intrusion on g4 and leaving a safe spot for the king.
65,1,31,1O-O,b'r1bn1rk1/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/3p4/3P4/1PP2N1P/1BBN1PP1/1R1QR1K1 w - -',Castling at last. But on the sixteenth move!
66,1,32,1Ne5,b'r1bn1rk1/pp2b1pp/1q2pn2/3pN3/3P4/1PP4P/1BBN1PP1/1R1QR1K1 b - -',This move by white was easy to predict but hard to stop. The knight will be very active and his other colleague will also rush to secure him.
67,1,33,1Nf7,b'r1b2rk1/pp2bnpp/1q2pn2/3pN3/3P4/1PP4P/1BBN1PP1/1R1QR1K1 w - -',Willing to exchange knights. Of course white has no intention to do this.
68,1,34,1Ndf3,b'r1b2rk1/pp2bnpp/1q2pn2/3pN3/3P4/1PP2N1P/1BB2PP1/1R1QR1K1 b - -',Secures the other knight. Right now whites's position looks quite stable and well developed while black is making only defensive moves. Notice that black's bishop and rook on the queenside have never moved!
69,1,35,1Qc7,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1bnpp/4pn2/3pN3/3P4/1PP2N1P/1BB2PP1/1R1QR1K1 w - -',Increases preassure on e5 but leaves the e6 pawn practically unguarded.
70,1,36,1Qd3,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1bnpp/4pn2/3pN3/3P4/1PPQ1N1P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Now we're in for the big time. White's pieces have taken attacking positions. If black's knight on f6 falls white can mate black's king.
71,1,37,1Nd6,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3npn2/3pN3/3P4/1PPQ1N1P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',Trying to occupy the e4 spot. This move however leaves the g5 spot for white's knight unguarded.
72,1,38,2Ng5,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3npn2/3pN1N1/3P4/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',Black is in all sorts of trouble. After 21. Nxh6 black's defense must fall. To prevent this black tries to block the b1-h7 diagonal with his knights.
73,1,39,2Nfe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3np3/3pN1N1/3Pn3/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',First knight goes into action.
74,1,40,2Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3np3/3pN3/3PN3/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 b - -',And falls.
75,1,41,2dxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3np3/4N3/3Pp3/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R2R1K1 w - -',Clever move but white has other plans.
76,1,42,2Rxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/3np3/4N3/3PR3/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',22. Rxe4! White gives up a rook to open the diagonal for the killer battery. Let's see how the game progresses.
77,1,43,2Nxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/4p3/4N3/3Pn3/1PPQ3P/1BB2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Second knight goes for the e4 spot.
78,1,44,2Qxe4,b'r1b2rk1/ppq1b1pp/4p3/4N3/3PQ3/1PP4P/1BB2PP1/1R4K1 b - -',And falls as well. Later after the game we have discussed with vkoval that black could probably hold on (a little longer I guess but who knows) by playing 23. ... g6 24. Nxg6 Rf7 25. Ne5 Rg7. Black played something different...
79,1,45,2Rf5,b'r1b3k1/ppq1b1pp/4p3/4Nr2/3PQ3/1PP4P/1BB2PP1/1R4K1 w - -',Another piece blocks the path however it can be easily removed.
80,1,46,2g4,b'r1b3k1/ppq1b1pp/4p3/4Nr2/3PQ1P1/1PP4P/1BB2P2/1R4K1 b - g3',It looks like it's curtains however vkoval has other plans than quitting.
81,1,47,2Rxe5,b'r1b3k1/ppq1b1pp/4p3/4r3/3PQ1P1/1PP4P/1BB2P2/1R4K1 w - -',24. ... Rxe5! Nice move! It looks like black can get back into the play after white kills the rook but I have noticed that my pieces are developed really nice and it is possible to end the game right now. I must admit that during the last few moves I have encouraged vkoval (thanks!) to play on to show that the mate is really a fact.
82,1,48,2Qxh7+,b'r1b3k1/ppq1b1pQ/4p3/4r3/3P2P1/1PP4P/1BB2P2/1R4K1 b - -',Forces the king to f8.
83,1,49,2Kf8,b'r1b2k2/ppq1b1pQ/4p3/4r3/3P2P1/1PP4P/1BB2P2/1R4K1 w - -',The only possible move.
84,1,50,2Bg6,b'r1b2k2/ppq1b1pQ/4p1B1/4r3/3P2P1/1PP4P/1B3P2/1R4K1 b - -',Black must now remove his bishop to prevent mate.
85,1,51,2Bc5,b'r1b2k2/ppq3pQ/4p1B1/2b1r3/3P2P1/1PP4P/1B3P2/1R4K1 w - -',It doesn't really matter if black moves his bishop along the a3-f8 or the h4-d8 diagonal. White follows with the attack.
86,1,52,2Qh8+,b'r1b2k1Q/ppq3p1/4p1B1/2b1r3/3P2P1/1PP4P/1B3P2/1R4K1 b - -',Forcing the king to e7.

102,1,68,3Qb5#,b'r1b5/ppq5/4p1B1/1Qk5/2P3P1/1P2b2P/1B3P2/3R2K1 b - -',The game ends with white checkmating black. All of white's pieces played a role in this attack while most of black's resources were left untouched and played a static role. So remember to develop your pieces!!! Many thanks for vkoval for his patience in the final stages of the game. Dzieki stary :)
103,2,0,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? c6 seems a stronger reply followed with d5 and asserting some control of the centre. Continuing from the text move Black might be considering c5 or e5 shortly.
104,2,1,Bg7,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? This seems out of step with Black's defence some how better might be to continue c5 or e5 to prevent White's e5.
105,2,2,f4,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',Common is Knf3 instead the text is playable but not favoured.
106,2,3,Na6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n2p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Non-standard but seen in H Rob Evan der Plas vs Valery Vladimirovich Pankratov 1996 ending in a draw.  More usual is ..0-0.  I find the text move too passive: it achieves some development but apparently for its own sake.
107,2,4,e5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n2p1np1/4P3/2PP1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',! Direct.
108,2,5,Ng4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n5p1/4P3/2PP2n1/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',? Although it keeps Black's position open this knight is hanging and will draw attention from White's pieces. White gains time in spades. Black might have considered instead Knh5 though best might be Knd7.
109,2,6,h5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/4P2p/2PP2n1/2N5/PP2B1PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq h6',White is being allowed to dictate the shape of Black's defence making him play some unwelcome moves. Even Knh6 instead would prove uncomfortable in a few moves.
110,2,7,Nh6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5pn/4P2p/2PP4/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',One of few options for the knight but again unwelcome -- he'll have to move again once White develops his black square bishop and his Queen to d2.  Possibly worthy of consideration is the energetic ..Knxe5 instead.
111,2,8,Nf5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/4Pn1p/2PP1B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',Not a bad place for Black's knight but it has come at some cost in time -- 3 of the last 4 moves by Black have involved this piece alone! In any case White would otherwise follow with Qd2 threatening to win a piece. Black's knight would have to move again or be supported costing more time.
112,2,9,1d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/3PPn1p/2P2B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR b KQkq -',Largely forced -- White's centre would crumble on the loss of this pawn advancing finds safety and pressure. Note if Black had considered say c6 earlier this move would not hold nearly the same strength.
113,2,10,1Nc5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/6p1/2nPPn1p/2P2B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',? Again this is a good square for a knight but it has come at some cost -- the text is fairly premature as it's not clear what this move achieves Black could have done this later and it does nothing about White's advance.  Black's development is on the slow side.  Better might be ..e6.
114,2,11,1g4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/6p1/2nPPn1p/2P2BP1/2N4P/PP2B3/R2QK1NR b KQkq g3',! White continues to cramp Black without hesitation.

116,2,13,1Qh4+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2BBq/2N4P/PP1Q4/R3K1NR w KQkq -',? Even though White's King has yet to castle in an open position he is difficult to attack.  After sidestepping to d1 -- on the way to relative safety -- it remains a task for Black to find a way in while still leaving enough time to protect his own King. This move was anticipated by White's 14. Qd2.
117,2,14,Qxg4+,b'r1b1k2r/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2Bq1/2N4P/PP1Q4/R2K2NR w kq -',?! This came as a surprise to White. The only impression I can make is that Black in making this sacrifice is going straight for White's King.  However I'm also of the opinion that this is a blunder by Black as the text will show -- he should note that upon winning White's h-rook the key square h2 is covered by White's black square bishop and his Queen. Moreover when the White King moves again to c2 White's knight is no longer vulnerable. There seems no way for Black to make good his loss (in this open position his Queen counts for a lot). Further Black has neglected his own development giving up his active Queen while a bishop and rook are stuck at home. Last even in this open position I cannot see how Black will have the time to profit from the long h-file as the initiative stays with White.
118,2,15,1Kc2,b'r1b1k3/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2BP1/2N5/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q -',! Protects the Knight avails the rook avoids a check and finds safety.  A fine move.  Note the key h2 square is very well protected so White will retain the initiative unchecked beginning with a fork on c7. That open h-file is not intimidating at all -- Black is not sufficiently developed to exploit it.
119,2,16,1Ne7,b'r1b1k3/ppp1npb1/4p1p1/2nPP3/2P2BP1/2N5/PPKQ4/R5Nr w q -',In view of Black's material deficit and lack of attacking options this is forced and costs further time.
120,2,17,1Nb5,b'r1b1k3/ppp1npb1/4p1p1/1NnPP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q -',! Aiming right at c7. Black's position is such that there is no satisfactory defence. It's at times like these that one really needs that Queen.  What follows is just technique.
121,2,18,1Na6,b'r1b1k3/ppp1npb1/n3p1p1/1N1PP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr w q -',Somewhat forced but still White is not prevented from playing Knxc7 immediately.  The alternatives don't look great either.  Placing the King on the d-file is not on and Kf8 offers only temporary respite [White continues d5-d6 promising to place his Queen on d8 after any exchange].
122,2,19,1Nxc7+,b'r1b1k3/ppN1npb1/n3p1p1/3PP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q -',! White will open up the d-file and prevent Black's king from finding safety for a decisive endgame.
123,2,20,2dxe7,b'r1b1k3/pp2Ppb1/4p1p1/3nP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q -',The correct choice -- Black cannot capture White's bishop without conceding instant mate.
124,2,21,2Rd1,b'r1b1k3/pp2npb1/4p1p1/4P3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/3R2Nr b q -',Threatening mate on d8 once again.
125,2,22,2Bg5,b'r1b1k3/pp3pb1/2n1p1p1/4P1B1/2P3P1/8/PPKQ4/3R2Nr b q -',! Continuing to threaten mate with Qd8 next and mate in two.
126,2,23,2Qxb7,b'r4k2/pQ3pb1/2n1p1p1/4P1B1/2P3P1/8/PPK5/3R2Nr b - -',! White is interested in displacing Black's rook on a8 (this isn't a pawn grab) the only piece preventing a back row mate. Beware of ..Rb8 too -- White will happily sacrifice his Queen or else face perpetual check but then is still guarranteed mate in two.
127,2,24,2Rh2+,b'r4k2/pQ3pb1/2n1p1p1/4P1B1/2P3P1/8/PPK4r/3R2N1 w - -',One of very few options left for Black.  Teeing up the threat of perpetual check is the best plan now but it will need a particular error by White to work.
128,2,25,Rb8,b'1r3k2/pQ3pb1/2n1p1p1/4P1B1/2P3P1/8/PP5r/1K1R2N1 w - -',Again natural for Black to set up a (classical) perpetual check.  If White does anything other than trade his Queen here he will draw.  Upon sacrificing his Queen it is mate in 2...

It was to decide who goes to the next round. I was half a pt behind to iamthundercat so the only way I advance is if I win. He wins or we draw he moves on and I am out. So we begin...

I also like to jam the black's King side with either Knight or Bishop often times risking to get stuck and undeveloped...
133,3,3,Be3,b'rn1qkbnr/pb1p1ppp/1p2p3/2p1P3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Typical attempts at development. I am hoping to mantain control of the middle but it doesn't seem to work so well. He is pulling all the right moves so far.

I don't see immediate threat that would at the same time develop black. So I shift the Queen on the side where I expect he will Castle. Also the Queen provides additional support to g2 pawn attacked by the black Bb7.
138,3,8,Ng6,b'rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2p1n1/2b1P3/3N2Q1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',For some reason I failed to see this move as dangerous... so I intend to continue developing...

However this was a weak move. It weakens protection to the g2 pawn as well as it doesn't account for the following move by the black....

Note that if I exchange Queens his Knight assumes h4 position which will cause either loss of pawn or loss of Castling options (g2 pawn is then under the attack by both Bb2 and Kg4... I can't advance the pawn as it is protecting a Rh1 from Bb2 attack and I am not hot about playing Kf1). If I move Queen in any other way my Nd4 is history as it is attacked then by both Bc5 and Qh4.
141,3,11,1h3,b'rn2k2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2p1n1/2b1P3/3N2Qq/2NBB2P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',I still have castling option on the other side and maybe I can get my Rh1 involved early. I am losing my g2 pawn but at this point I am at peace with this. It could be worse...

My hold on the center is not so important at this point he is managing to develop as planned he is attacking me in the middle of all places and my development so far is fairly useless. My overagressive play seems to have backfired this time.

He seemed stuck going back and forth with his rook and bishop. Something had to open up and he was willing to sacrifice a pawn for it. Can't blame him.

170,3,40,3Nc5,b'3r2k1/6pp/p3p1p1/PpNb2P1/1PrR1P2/2PR4/3K4/8 b - -',I wanted to put my Knight in action and i felt if it gets up there it will be able to start penetrating his defensive ranks and cause trouble. Currently attacking his a6 pawn as well as e6 pawn (he can't take the Knight on e6 with the Bishop uncovering his Rd8)
171,3,41,Ra8,b'r5k1/6pp/p3p1p1/PpNb2P1/1P1R1P2/2P5/3K4/8 w - -',Forced. It protects the a6 pawn as well as it moves the Rook away from the troubled d-file.
172,3,42,3Nd7,b'r5k1/3N2pp/p3p1p1/Pp1b2P1/1P1R1P2/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',But it's too late my Knight becomes very strong.
173,3,43,3Rxd5,b'r7/6k1/p5pp/Pp1R4/1P3P2/2P5/3K4/8 b - -',With that Knight putting so much pressure on his ranks it was just a matter of time I would equalize pt differential.
174,3,44,3h5,b'r7/6k1/p5p1/Pp1R3p/1P3P2/2P5/3K4/8 w - -',I knew that that h-pawn will cause trouble sooner or later. I still think had he pushed it earlier he would have been better off. At this point I gotta get my King into action or it might be too late.
175,3,45,Re8+,b'4r3/6k1/p5p1/Pp1R3p/1P3P2/2P5/4K3/8 w - -',His rook had many options of attack. He could have attacked c-file or f-file. He decided to grace my King with his attack. Thank you very much :)
176,3,46,4f5,b'8/6k1/p3r1p1/Pp1R1P1p/1P6/2P5/5K2/8 b - -',Bad Move. I didn't see his next move.
177,3,47,4Rf6,b'8/6k1/p4rp1/Pp1R1P1p/1P6/2P5/5K2/8 w - -',Nice. Maybe simple but I did not see it coming. I was blinded by the expected pawn exchange.
178,3,48,gxf5,b'8/6k1/p4r2/Pp1R1p1p/1P6/2P2K2/8/8 w - -',I am down again! At this point I am starting to lose my hope. I am starting to consider giving up and offering a draw. I don't feel like I am in danger of losing but I sure am not in advantageous position. But I feel like I could pull a draw easy as long as I don't make any blunders. I don't feel either like he will make any blunders cause up to that point he did not look like a player that makes blunders. The only reason I don't offer a draw is because it does me no good to my tourney aspirations.
179,3,49,4Kg3,b'8/6k1/p4r2/Pp1R1p1p/1P6/2P3K1/8/8 b - -',I want to keep an option to defend against any of his pawn pushes so I get in the middle. 
180,3,50,4Rd4,b'8/8/p4rk1/Pp5p/1P1R1p2/2P2K2/8/8 b - -',I liked this move cause now I get the chance to involve my stale c-pawn
181,3,51,4h4,b'8/8/p4rk1/Pp6/1P1R1p1p/2P2K2/8/8 w - -',It did not look good for me. I can't take the f-pawn cause after the rook exchange his h-pawn is Queening. I wanted to offer a draw and maybe I luck out and he accepts. But still a draw does me no good for the tourney. So I keep playing. I am hoping for a miracle. He will Queen one of his pawns.
182,3,52,4c4,b'8/8/p4rk1/Pp6/1PPR1p1p/5K2/8/8 b - -',Honestly at this point I am trying to distract him and maybe get his rook away from the f pawn. Little did I know that this turned out to be a game turning move.
183,3,53,4h3,b'8/8/p4rk1/Pp6/1PPR1p2/5K1p/8/8 w - -',Ok maybe it was that one since he didn't take my c-pawn but can you blame him? He is few moves away from Queening! I finally realize I can't stop him Queening one of his pawns. I am about 3 seconds from resigning ... when all of sudden I see the following sequence of moves!!! I did not believe it until they actually unfolded: 
184,3,54,5Rd1,b'8/8/p4rk1/PP6/1P6/8/5p1K/3R4 b - -',I am sacrificing my rook! .... I actually foresaw all this I felt pretty proud of that calculation. In other words I was tempo down and a rook sacrifice away from restoring tempo balance in my favor.... although with a big piece disadvantage at that point I am so close to Queening my pawns I feel gaining tempo is all I needed.
185,3,55,5Rxf1,b'8/8/p4rk1/PP6/1P6/8/7K/5R2 b - -',There goes my homie. He sacrificed for the betterment of his nation. His deeds will be remembered for the generations to come...
186,3,56,5bxa6,b'8/8/P5k1/P7/1P6/8/7K/5r2 b - -',At this point Queening cannot be stopped....
187,3,57,5b8=Q,b'1Q6/8/6k1/r7/8/8/7K/8 b - -',I could not believe it... To this date the most significant win on this site in so many ways.
188,3,58,5Rg5,b'1Q6/8/6k1/6r1/8/8/7K/8 w - -',"But here I realize even this is not straightforward. At one point I was struggling  figuring out how to finish it. Also one of my Master level team members sent me a message with finishing set of moves for this game. I naturally refused to look until I finished it on my own. After the game I took a look at his suggestion and he said ""Your game can easily be won with:........... "" and then 30 moves later CHECKMATE!!!!  LOL...... In other words this is not straightforward ending. One really has to work for the win. 
This game me taught me the value of sticking with the game even when things look quite bleak. "
189,3,59,Ke8,b'4k3/8/8/3Q4/7K/8/8/6r1 w - -',After Ke8 the rook is gone with the following move:
190,3,60,6Qa8+,b'Q3k3/8/8/8/7K/8/8/6r1 b - -',"any move by King is followed by Qa7  
Here he finally resigned and I moved on to the next round. Unfortunately for my stoic opponent he was half a point away from same. Hats off iamthundercat great game great battle thanks for the wonderful chess experience. Wish you Good chess in the future...."
191,4,0,c4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',GM Mihai Suba is an excellent GM who's played a lot of strange ideas and frequently pulls out oddly spectacular victories.  In this game he takes black against GM Raicevic.  He begins the game with a speculative gambit and quickly gains a developmental advantage.  His pieces find ingenious ways to march forward and he wins in nice style.  I recommend flipping the board as Suba plays black and having a board at your side while watching this so that you can analyze variations.
192,4,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Suba played the English as white to great success.  While most of his finds are for white this is a great game against his favorite first move.  I'm going to skim over the opening.
193,4,2,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2P1p3/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.
194,4,3,Ng5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/6N1/2P1p3/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',White targets the weak pawn.
195,4,4,b5,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1p4N1/2P1p3/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq b6',"This is Suba's idea the Bellon gambit.  If white takes black will get a good game via 5.cxb5 d5 or 5.Nxb5 I think is met by 5... c6 with ...d5 to follow but maybe 5... Bb7 is a more natural continuation.  I think white's best response is 5.d3 where white is solid and black's pawns will soon look weak.

I initially wrote the awful idea of 5.Nxb5 d5?! 6.cxd5 Qxd5?? but that hangs a queen to 7.Nxc7 .  I got a bad rating off this and I apoligize as it was a silly mistake to make.  I hope others won't rank it as harshly for one silly (but now corrected) blunder in the analysis."
196,4,5,Qc2,b'rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1p4N1/2P1p3/2N5/PPQPPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',White adds pressure to e4 while adding a potential defender to c4.
197,4,6,Bb7,b'rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/5n2/8/2p1N3/2N5/PPQPPPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Black develops with tempo against e4.
198,4,7,Qa4,b'rn2kb1r/pbpp1ppp/5q2/8/Q1p5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',A reasonable move as black cannot defend c4 however maybe white does better to play the solid 8.e3.
199,4,8,Bc5,b'rn2k2r/pbpp1ppp/5q2/2b5/Q1p5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Black continues to develop with threats.
200,4,9,Bb6,b'rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b3q2/8/2Q5/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',So after ten moves white is up a pawn but his bishops looks AWFUL.  Black's got two potentially useful files a nice pair of bishop and an active queen.
201,4,10,1Nd5,b'rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b3q2/3N4/2Q5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',However the developed queen can also prove a weakness white forks queen and bishop.
202,4,11,1Qd6,b'rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/3N4/2Q5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Black does not want to trade his light squared bishop for black's knight the light one is better than the dark because the dark squared bishop's diagonal has been blunted by the pawn one e3.
203,4,12,1Nf4,b'rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Q2N2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ -',White is forced to make a decision with the knight but I think this is a bad choice.  I think white should trade getting rid of one of black's bishops.  Maybe I'm wrong though as white will have an awful time developing and black has a great a file.
204,4,13,1Re8,b'rn2r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Q2N2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ -',Black continues development and adds a little pressure to the knight on f4.
205,4,14,1O-O,b'r3r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1bnq4/8/2Q2N2/4P3/PP1PBPPP/R1B2RK1 b - -',Black has basically concluded development (as opposed to white who has an embarassingly bad bishop on c1) and he now goes for the attack the two bishop are pointing menacingly towards the king and the rest of the pieces now enter the attack with the following excellent move.
206,4,15,1Nd4,b'r3r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Qn1N2/4P3/PP1PBPPP/R1B2RK1 w - -',The knight should not be taken as after 15.exd4 Qxf4 and black has targets on d4 and e2.
207,4,16,1Bd1,b'r3r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Qn1N2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BB1RK1 b - -',White retains his pair of bishops but he only has two pieces off the back rank.
208,4,17,1Re4,b'r5k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2QnrN2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BB1RK1 w - -',The knight still shouldn't be taken and white threatens the queen (16... Nf3  would win the white queen).  Suba continues to develop with threats.
209,4,18,Rae8,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/3nrN2/2Q1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BB1RK1 w - -',And now black has concluded development.
210,4,19,1Nh3,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/3nr3/2Q1P2N/PP1P1PPP/R1BB1RK1 b - -',The knight moves away now black's knight is attacked but white's one developed piece (besides his queen) is now a knight on the rim commonly known to be a weakness.
211,4,20,1Qg6,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/8/3nr3/2Q1P2N/PP1P1PPP/R1BB1RK1 w - -',But once again black manages to retain his powerful knight on d4.  The knight is still safe as 18.exd4?? Qxg2 ! 19.Kxg2 Rg4#.
212,4,21,1f3,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/8/3nr3/2Q1PP1N/PP1P2PP/R1BB1RK1 b - -',White must shut down the h1-a8 diagonal.
213,4,22,1Rh4,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/8/3n3r/2Q1PP1N/PP1P2PP/R1BB1RK1 w - -',And as always the knight has no need to retreat as black would take back with the bishop winning black's queen with a royal fork.  Black also brings to the kingside with the threat of ...Rxh3 as the g pawn is pinned.
214,4,23,1Kh1,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/8/3n3r/2Q1PP1N/PP1P2PP/R1BB1R1K b - -',The king sidesteps the pin so the knight on d4 is (finally) forced to retreat.
215,4,24,1Nf5,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/5n2/7r/2Q1PP1N/PP1P2PP/R1BB1R1K w - -',But it stays on the kingside.
216,4,25,2d4,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b4q1/5n2/3P3r/2Q1PP1N/PP4PP/R1BB1R1K b - d3',Trying to keep the dark squares defended.
217,4,26,2Qe6,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b2q3/5n2/3P3r/2Q1PP1N/PP4PP/R1BB1R1K w - -',This is either a weak move or an extremely clever move.  Black's queen intends to find a home on h6 but first it pressures e3.  However white gains a free tempo attacking black's queen maybe though white's next (developing) move actually brings his bishop away from it's defensive duties.  It turns out that this idea proves extremely useful later.
218,4,27,2Bb3,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b2q3/5n2/3P3r/1BQ1PP1N/PP4PP/R1B2R1K b - -',Looking back from move 29 I think that 20... Qe6 is one of the most fantastic moves of the game.  It acted as a decoy to bring the bishop away from it's defensive square on d1.
219,4,28,2e4,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b5q/5n2/3PP2r/1BQ2P1N/PP4PP/R1B2R1K b - -',The natural response a fork that makes the queen look extremely exposed on h6.  However Suba has the game in control.  The following sacrifices shatter white's kingside.
220,4,29,2hxg3,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b5q/8/3PP2r/1BQ2PPN/PP4P1/R1B2R1K b - -',After 23.Kg1 Ne2  forking king queen bishop and even pawn on d4 should leave the advantage in black's hands.
221,4,30,2Rxh3+,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b5q/8/3PP3/1BQ2PPr/PP4P1/R1B2R1K w - -',And the kingside cover is blown so he flees.
222,4,31,2Kg1,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b5q/8/3PP3/1BQ2PPr/PP4P1/R1B2RK1 b - -',After 24.gxh3 Qxh3  I assume Suba wouldn't've taken the prepetual but would've played 25.Kg1 Qg3  26.Kh1 Re5!! threatenening 27... Rh5# and when the rook is taken 28.dxe5 Qh3# because the dark bishop has once again entered the game.  This would've been a fabulous finish but the attack still retains interest.
223,4,32,2Kf2,b'4r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b6/8/3PP3/1BQ2PP1/PP3KP1/R1B4q b - -',So after a few checks white seems to have diluted some of the attack.  How to continue?
224,4,33,2Ba6,b'4r1k1/p1pp1ppp/bb6/8/3PP3/1BQ2PP1/PP3KP1/R1B4q w - -',Black's bishop had lost value on b7 (it was stuffed by the pawn chain) and it now finds a new way to take part in the attack.
225,4,34,2g4,b'4r1k1/p1pp1ppp/bb6/8/3PP1P1/1BQ2P2/PP3KP1/R1B4q b - -',Giving the king luft (space) against ...Qf1 .
226,4,35,2Bf1,b'4r1k1/p1pp1ppp/1b6/8/3PP1P1/1BQ2P2/PP3KP1/R1B2b1q w - -',However Suba finds better thatn 28... Qf1  where black might escape.  This move wins g2 and brings the attack back to life (not that it had died it just looked stymied for a moment).
227,4,36,2Bd1,b'4r1k1/p1pp1ppp/1b6/8/3PP1P1/2Q2P2/PP3KP1/R1BB1b1q b - -',The bishop tries to return to the defensive square it was coaxed out of by 20...Qe6!
228,4,37,d5,b'4r1k1/p1p2ppp/1b6/3p4/3PP1P1/2Q2P2/PP4q1/R1BBKb2 w - d6',Now black has equalized material (which seems somewhat unimportant now) and he adds pressure to the e file.
229,4,38,3Be3,b'4r1k1/p1p2ppp/1b6/3p4/3PP1P1/2Q1BP2/PP4q1/R2BKb2 b - -',This may lose a pawn but it closes the e file with a following f4.
230,4,39,3f4,b'4r1k1/p1p2ppp/1b6/8/3PpPP1/2Q1B3/PP4q1/R2BKb2 b - -',Now Suba is up a pawn but the attack is still more important.
231,4,40,3Bd3,b'4r1k1/p1p2ppp/1b6/8/3PpPP1/2QbB3/PP4q1/R2BK3 w - -',An excellent outpost for the bishop that takes it out of harms way. 
232,4,41,3b4,b'4r1k1/p1p2ppp/1b6/8/1P1PpPP1/2QbB3/P5q1/R2BK3 b - b3',Trying to stop ...c5! which would allow the dark squared bishop to enter the game with devastating effect via Bd8-h4.
233,4,42,3h5,b'4r1k1/p1p2pp1/1b6/7p/1P1PpPP1/2QbB3/P5q1/R2BK3 w - h6',This odd looking move follows the same plan.  When the pawn is taken white loses the ability to block the bishop's maneuver with g5.  Another spectacular move and a very tough one to see at least for me (hey that rhymed!).
234,4,43,c5,b'4r1k1/p4pp1/1b6/2p4P/1P1PpP2/2QbB3/P5q1/R2BK3 w - c6',This second pawn sacrifice lets the bishop take it's desired path of d8-h4.
235,4,44,3h6,b'4r1k1/p4pp1/1b5P/2p5/1P1PpP2/2QbB3/P5q1/R2BK3 b - -',Hoping to complicate.
236,4,45,3Qc6,b'4r1k1/p4pp1/1bQ4P/8/1P1ppP2/3bB3/P5q1/R2BK3 b - -',One last complication.
237,4,46,3dxe3,b'4r1k1/p4pp1/1bQ4P/8/1P2pP2/3bp3/P5q1/R2BK3 w - -',A great reply!  Who needs the rook when black mates with Qd2# or Qf2#.  Black resigned here.  I hope you enjoyed this spectacular and ever insightful attack.  The gambit led to good compensation and he always found astonishing ideas to keep the attack going.  If you have any comments or criticisms I'd love to hear them.  I think studying the way ideas are formed around use of pieces and tactical plans could greatly help almost anyone's play.  I hope to study and improve from this game more when I have time.  Honestly I think this is one of the most phenomenal games I've ever seen and I hope I gave it justice here.  If you give a low rating please tell me why.
238,5,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is my norm opening I decided not to change this as it is my fave. Those of you who know me is I don't like boring openings which in my opinion is almost everything apart from 1.e4. After 1.e4 there are loads of fun and wild gambits! In thi game you'll see one of them.
239,5,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',This is my favourite response as it lets me play my fave opening which you will see. There are many other responses 1...e6 (yawn) 1.c6 (solid and I sometimes play it but it is boring) 1...c5 Sicilian well if this happens I'll play the Smith morra Gambit.
240,5,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Standard.

242,5,4,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',"The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of ""Naval Intelligence"" a very nice little game!.) "
243,5,5,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. I now has the chance to play my fave as I have already mentioned the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?
244,5,6,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',This is the Evans Gambit. This romantic gambit has proven to be greatly resilient to modern technology while it is not generally thought of as a path to advantage it hasn't been refuted(correct me if I'm wrong).The idea of this opening is to gain momentum while opening the centre. this is often at the expense of a pawn or two.For this reason this line of the Guoco Piano has often attracted attention from more aggressive players and and will probably continue to do so in the future. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times.  He even used it to beat none other than ANAND! Pretty good surprise weaponno?
245,5,7,Bxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative.
246,5,8,c3,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre.. 
247,5,9,Ba5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',This retreat is probably the most natural responce to the Evans Gambit.The e1-a5 diagonal pinning the c3 and d2 pawns for the momentand more importantly is not in any kind of trouble on a5. or instance it would be in danger on c5 because of d4. Or 5.Be7 which is solid yet deemed passive. On the other side though white will be able to put pressure on blacks position with Ba3 later on. Black's plan to meet this is with d2-d3.
248,5,10,d4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq d3',White seizes space in the centre. Alternatives here are the imediate 6.0-0 which is not so popular or 6.Qb3!? which starts an immediate atack. These moves are interchangeable though and are normally played at some stage of the game. I recommend my chosen move.
249,5,11,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',As I said. Again logical solidifying the e5 pawn and also stopping the danger of Ba3. An adequate and more common alternative is 6...exd4.
250,5,12,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I castle to get my king into safety before  start my attack. This move also breaks the pin on the c3 pawn.
251,5,13,exd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black takes the pawn a common effective move.
252,5,14,cxd4,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b7/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',I recapture building up my space advantage in the centre.
253,5,15,Bb6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Now we have reached a very common position from the Evan's Gambit. There are two main options I can take. I can aim for long term compensation with 9.d5 which Anderssen preffered. Many games with 9.d5 continue like 9...Na5 10.Bb2 Ne7 11. Bd3 0-0 12.Nc3 Ng6 13. Ne2 c5 14.Qd2 f6 15. Kh1 Rb8 16.Ng3. This would be the strategic positional approach with less attacking chances wich doesn't suit my style.. I prefer Morphy's more tactical and logical developing move 9.Nc3 when I maintain possibilities of advancing either of my two central pawns according to Black's moves. This is obviously a more dynamic approach.
254,5,16,Nc3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! I decide Morphy's dynamic logical approach. It is often thought by beginners that when you have gambited a pawn you need to attack and mate as soon as possible with out developing there pieces this often results in a failed attack. Morphy believed that all pieces should be involved in an attack. This seems subtle and lets Black off the hook because it is too quiet but it builds up my forces for my attack.
255,5,17,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',? This move looks like a good developing move however it is one of the traps of Morphy's continuation. This leaves Black in trouble this will show you why. People really stop falling for this trap against me because whenever they play this horrible move they always lose.
256,5,18,1e5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/4P3/2BP4/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',! Immediately putting pressure on Black's position and attacking the Black Knight.
257,5,19,1dxe5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/2BP4/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',Black does exactly whatI wanted him to do. he opens the a3-f8 diagonal for my bishop to attack.
258,5,20,1Ba3,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/2BP4/B1N2N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',! This builds up pressure on the Kingside and prevents castling.
259,5,21,1exd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/8/2Bp4/B1N2N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',?This is a poor move. Amarg tried 11.e4?? which failed miserable as this move did! Pawn grabbing doesn't pay.
260,5,22,1Re1+,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/8/2Bp4/B1N2N2/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq -',I' keep the attack going. You'd think I did this so the pawn couldn't take my knight on c3 but I'm gonna sac it so I don't really care about that!
261,5,23,1Be6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1bn2/8/2Bp4/B1N2N2/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq -',?? This fails completely as you will see however this move is the only move possible.
262,5,24,1Qb3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1bn2/8/2Bp4/BQN2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',! I build up the pressure!
263,5,25,1dxc3,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1bn2/8/2B5/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w kq -',?? Not again! Black should be doing something that defends his King. Instead he just takes material. 'Goodbye horsey seeya in Hell!'
264,5,26,1Bxe6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1Bn2/8/8/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',This wins a pawn and ultimateley results in mate.
265,5,27,1Qxe6+,b'r2qk2r/ppp3pp/1bn1Qn2/8/8/B1p2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq -',Check.
266,5,28,1Rad1,b'r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/1b2Qn2/8/8/B1p2N2/P4PPP/3RR1K1 b kq -',! I now have full control of the central files.
267,5,29,1Bxf2+,b'r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/4Qn2/8/8/B1p2N2/P4bPP/3RR1K1 w kq -', ? think this was a poor attemt at an interference move. As you will see it doesn't interfere with my invisible attack for long!
268,5,30,Ng4+,b'r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/4Q3/8/6n1/B1p2N2/P4KPP/3RR3 w kq -',Well if this was the whole point of 16...Bxf2  then i'm really scared! Lol!
269,5,31,1Kg1,b'r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/4Q3/8/6n1/B1p2N2/P5PP/3RR1K1 b kq -',I retreat the King.
270,5,32,1c5,b'r2qk2r/pp2n1pp/4Q3/2p5/6n1/B1p2N2/P5PP/3RR1K1 w kq c6',Nothing can prolong mate now. 'Hahahahahhahahhahahh' sorry did i do that outloud?
271,5,33,2Qc7#,b'r1k4r/ppQ1R1pp/8/2p5/8/B1p2N2/P5Pn/6K1 b - -',"Checkmate! This game shows the effectiveness of gambits especiaklly in Blitz games where Black often seems to get disorientated in the wild position and goes pawn grabbing. The answer to my question 'Do Pesky Pawngrabbers Prosper?' Answer: 'No!!!!!!!!!!' I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. Thanks to the player i played this game i couldn't  of done it without you! One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why.

272,6,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is a second game in the Smith-Morra white (me) plays quite aggresively then misses a very strong move that causes the game to extend to 26 moves.  I think the game shows a nice way of marching forward with threats based on black's weaknesses.
273,6,1,Bc5,b'rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',A reasonable move though I've never played against it before.  I don't have a high opinion as one of white's normal plans is queenside expansion with an eventual a3 and b4.  The bishop looks active but never does much on c5.
274,6,2,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2b5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',White is developing naturally and black will soon have trouble covering all the pressured squares.
275,6,3,d6,b'r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2npp3/2b5/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',I think this is a definite inaccuracy.  Black must try to cover b5 with 8... a6 otherwise white's knight can take control of the dark squares.  Note that white has made 5 developing moves (Nf3 Nc3 Bc4 Bf4 and 0-0) while black only has three (Bc5 Nc6 and Nge7).  Conventional wisdom says a pawn is worth three tempo white has two (and it's his turn) good development and a # of open files to use.  He also has two clear plans.
276,6,4,Nb5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2npp3/1Nb5/2B1PB2/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',I chose to target the dark squares I plan to start a quick attack which utilizes the fact that black has not castled.  d6 is looking very weak.  My other plan which is also very strong is 9.a3 with the plan of b4.  If black's bishop is hit away d6 will still prove very problematic for black.  He also has no good defense to b4 as 9... a5 10.Nb5 is a better version of the line in the game.
277,6,5,e5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2np4/1Nb1p3/2B1PB2/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',The ONLY way to retain d6 (for the moment) but my c4 bishop has just been unleashed on my opponent's kingside.  Note that rottweiler has played completely reasonable moves and is finding himself in a huge mess.  Besides my bishop on c4 d5 is a great hole for my pieces to hop into.
278,6,6,1Ng5,b'r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2np4/1Nb1p1N1/2B1PB2/8/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Attacking the very weak square f7.  The dark squared bishop has been blocked but the ...e5 push opened up the light squares I love how I've done the same knight maneuver on both sides and his positions is trouble.
279,6,7,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2np4/1Nb1p1N1/2B1PB2/8/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Not good but I'll examine an alternative: 10... exf4 (trying to grab some material for his misery) is met by 11.Nxf7 Qd7 (I don't know what square is best) 12.Nbxd6 !? I could grab material but this seems more promising 12... Bxd6 13.Nxd6 Kf8 14.Qh5 with a lot of pressure on f7 according to Langrock the game might continue: 14... Ng6 15.Nf7 Qxf7 (moving the rooks is awful and if black gives up the rook white will infiltrate on h7- I can also win the d file with a great deal of pressure) 16.Bxf7  Kxf7 17.g3 and black has three pieces for the queen but it's difficult for him to mobilize this is black's most promising line but it seems that he'll have to survive for another 15 unpleasant moves to have any sort of play.  Development can be a fleeting advantage but if every turn is used then it can be permanent you're always a move ahead (or more) of your opponent.  While black has survived the brunt of the attack in this line he's STILL undeveloped.  You do have to play quickly and aggresively in most gambits but a developmental advantage can last a long time.
280,6,8,1Qh5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2np4/1Nb1p1NQ/2B1PB2/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',And white is simply better probably winning.  The threat is Qxh7# and black only has one defense the targets are now on the light squares f7 and h7.  It's like black had a choice lose d6 and fall apart on the light squares or play ...e5 and fall apart on the light squares.  In the Smith-Morra the ...e5 advance can be very strong but black has to be very careful about f7 and the hole on d5 which is great for knights (see Smith-Morra Gambit #1).
281,6,9,1h6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2npp1/2np3p/1Nb1p1NQ/2B1PB2/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - -',The only move but now black loses an exchange.
282,6,10,1Nxf7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nNp1/2np3p/1Nb1p2Q/2B1PB2/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Black must take the queen is attacked as are numerous discovered checks here's a sample of the danger: 12... Qb6?? 13.Nxh6  Kh7 14.Nf5#.
283,6,11,1Bd2,b'r1bq3k/pp2nQp1/2np3p/1Nb1p3/2B1P3/8/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"This is my worst move of the game.  In the Smith-Morra (especially when you're actually UP material) you should never have to retreat- a second after I pressed ""submit"" I spotted 14.Bg5 which can't be taken cause of 14... hxg5 15.Qh5#.  This move would've completely tied down black's game and would've been a nice move for the always moving forward style that many gambits have."
284,6,12,1a6,b'r1bq3k/1p2nQp1/p1np3p/1Nb1p3/2B1P3/8/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So... black is lost but he's not ready to give up yet and he's going to lash out in the following moves the rest of the game is pretty straightforward.
285,6,13,1Qh5,b'2bq3k/r3n1p1/p1np3p/1pb1p2Q/4P3/1BN5/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Getting off of the line of the rook and threatening 18.Bxh6 gxh6 19.Qxh6#.
286,6,14,1Nd5,b'2b2q1k/r3n1p1/p1np3p/1pbNp2Q/4P3/1B6/PP1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Trading off pieces.
287,6,15,2Kh1,b'2b2q1k/r5p1/p2p3p/1pbBp2Q/3nP3/8/PP1B1PPP/R4R1K b - -',Bringing my king off the g1-a7 diagonal and preparing f4.
288,6,16,Rf7,b'5q1k/5rp1/p2p3p/1pb1p2Q/3nPP2/8/PP1B2PP/R4R1K w - -',Praying for 23.fxe5?? Rxf1  mating it's not going to happen but what choice does black have?
289,6,17,Ne6,b'5q1k/5rp1/p2pn2p/1pb1pP1Q/4P3/8/PP1B2PP/R4R1K w - -',Again trying to tempt me to open the f file.  Black never really gets any play as much as he tries white's got a space advantage and active pieces.
290,6,18,2b4,b'5q1k/5rp1/p2pn2p/1pb1pP1Q/1P2P3/8/P2B2PP/R4R1K b - b3',Trying to bring his bishop to d4 the bishop's much weaker on the outpost than the knight would be.
291,6,19,2g4,b'5q1k/5rp1/pb1pn2p/1p2pP1Q/1P2P1P1/8/P2B3P/4RR1K b - g3',And black resigns my king is breathing a lot of air but he can't attack it yet and g5 is devastating.  I think this game shows a carefree way with pieces (except my blunder 14.Bd2?) and an attack on light squares then dark.  The ...e5 push can save black getting his pieces into the game and making the bishop of f4 look awful but it can only be played with great caution.  I think the line where black gives up his queen for three pieces is very interesting and if anyone would like to play a game (rated or unrated) in it give me a PM or challenge me.  As always please leave comments and improvements.  I hope you enjoyed!
292,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Being an unrated game against an opponent of what I perceive as equal or greater strength I throw caution to the wind and open with my king's pawn knowing an open tactical game will most likely ruin me.
293,7,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',As expected. I have a long history of facing (and losing to) Sicilians so I'm already planning my niche Sicilian response.
294,7,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"The closed Sicilian has been an efficient weapon of ""ambidextrous"" players like Spassky and Karpov as well as the great precision champion Smyslov."
295,7,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',I figure I'm in for a drawn out battle. My opponent knows his theory. This is black's most common response.
296,7,4,g3,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',I'm merely interested in seeing how much theory my opponent knows. This was a favorite continuation of Smyslov's.
297,7,5,g6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',No surprise here. Black hopes to put immediate and long-lasting pressure on d4. The trade-off is my almost indominatable control of e4.
298,7,6,Nge2,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Here I break well-established theory. In previous games (my own theory as it were) once the black king's bishop is fianchettoed the knight at c3 becomes an immediate target for the purposes of doubling my pawns on the c-file and rendering my queen's side indefensible (which is where most of the coming action is likely to take place). As a closed system I still have plenty of time to develop my bishops and castle though I must be careful of ...Nd4 which after the exchange would place a pawn on the powerful center square.
299,7,7,d6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',He continues development normally.
300,7,8,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',A mistake if only a small one. Now the black knight can safely traverse to the d4 square without fear of exchange lest I fork my own pieces in the process.
301,7,9,e5,b'r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq e6',A common move to hinder the e2 knight and to make room to develop black's own king's knight.
302,7,10,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',? Not sure about this move as it blocks the bishop and gives the knight minimal options from which to advance. This is the first indication to me that my opponent has not faced many positions like this one in the closed Sicilian.
303,7,11,Qd2,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQNPBP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Assuming (rightly so as we'll see in a second) that my opponent intends to advance his knight to one of the scant few squares available: g4. My text move here indicates that I'm prepared to exchange the bishop rather than save it (although I exchange it with my pawn structure intact ha ha!) and I certainly am prepared. In closed positions knights are often more valuable than bishops and this game eventually proves to be no exception.
304,7,12,Ng4,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P1n1/2NPB1P1/PPPQNPBP/R3K2R w KQkq -',My confidence always builds in a game when I have correctly guessed my opponent's next move :-)
305,7,13,a3,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P1n1/P1NPB1P1/1PPQNPBP/R3K2R b KQkq -',I won't call this a key move but I do think it necessary. Once e3 is exchanged my queen will be delayed there briefly leaving c2 unguarded and ripe for attack by the black queen's knight. This slight touch of prophylaxsis is to insure that my queen's side is aired of any immediate intruders.
306,7,14,Nxe3,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPn1P1/1PPQNPBP/R3K2R w KQkq -',Necessary to justify the sorte to g4.
307,7,15,1Qxe3,b'r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQkq -',Kingside pawn structure is preserved.
308,7,16,1O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R w KQ -',Black should be feeling comfortable right now. King is safely tucked away bishops have good diagonals to work with Queen has options rooks will soon be connected. It is my job to dispel this feeling of comfort.
309,7,17,1Nd5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2pNp3/4P3/P2PQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQ -',My intention is simple to show the power of my knights in a closed position.
310,7,18,1Nec3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2npb1p1/2pNp3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/R3K2R b KQ -',I relished this move only because I now have my justification for 5.Ng-e2 :-)
311,7,19,1Nd4,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pb1p1/2pNp3/3nP3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/R3K2R w KQ -',! It seems now that a2 may have given too much away. My opponent finds his opening to strike at c2 after all.
312,7,20,1O-O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pb1p1/2pNp3/3nP3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/2KR3R b - -',!? A dubious move to be sure but I see this as the best of a bad situation. My king needs fortification my c2 pawn needs defending the development of my rooks requires acceleration and this is the only move that accomplishes all three. The other alternative 13.Qd2 is unpleasant in the face of 13...Bg4 (that blasted g4 square again!) 14.f3 Be6 in which my kingside is weakened the a7-g1 diagonal opened for the queen and the bishop to strike if I castle kingside and eventual confrontation would emerge on the f-file not unlike King's Indian positions where my closed position becomes an open tactical nightmare. I'd have to castle queenside in that event anyway so I figured I might as well do so right off the bat without the awful f3 move haunting me the rest of the game.
313,7,21,1Rb8,b'1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pb1p1/2pNp3/3nP3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/2KR3R w - -',The dubious nature of my castling choice is immediately revealed. The queen's pawns are coming and they have heavy artillery behind them. My only option is to force my opponent to put out a fire while he is simultaneously starting one.
314,7,22,1f4,b'1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pb1p1/2pNp3/3nPP2/P1NPQ1P1/1PP3BP/2KR3R b - f3',The match is struck.

317,7,25,1Bd7,b'1r1q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3p2p1/2p5/3nPN2/P1NPQ1P1/1PP3BP/2KR3R w - -',My opponent mistakes my meaning. It is clear he understood my move to threaten his bishop not create luft for my c3 knight. This means he is probably not even considering the knight's presence there.

Bxf4 but black can still bag atleast the exchange by 23...Nxd2 24.Rxd2 Bxf4.

486,18,3,dxe4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black probably thinks White will take e4 and Black will win it back with Qh4  with White's king in disarray
487,18,4,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',This move transposes into a form of Blackmar-Diemer Gambit but where Black has already played e6 so Bg4 is impossible.

I must say that he has major guts although losing the queen may actually be better since desperate times call for desperate measures.

This game is a nice example that if black chooses for the setup d6-c6-Qc7-e5 white should never take on e5 with his d pawn. That gives black at least equality. Enjoy..

Because white played c4 already this pawn won't be able to defend the d4 and b4 squares. In many variations white can gain a usefull tempo by attacking that pawn with Be6.

But since white's Bc1 can't develop to g5 and h3 has just weakened the kingside where black is going to castle I figure this is a good time to make a play for some activity on the kingside.

703,25,11,Rf8,b'r3kr2/pppq2pp/2np1n2/2b1pbN1/2B5/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w q -',I use this opportunity to develop my king's rook to a good square the half-open f-file.  Now either Nf7 or Bf7 will lose material for white.  Notice that 10. g4 is no threat as black has the simple Bg6 to defend the h7 pawn.  Notice black can't play 0-0-0 just yet as Nf7 would win the exchange.

Instead of developing his pieces white is pursuing attacking (or possibly exchanging) aims in black's camp.  Since any exchange (for instance 11. Nxf6 Rxf6) favors black I'm in no rush to initiate them.
705,25,13,1O-O-O,b'2kr1r2/pppq2pp/2np1n2/2bNpbN1/2B5/3P3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',!  Now my development is complete while white is overextended and has many of his pieces at home.

My Bc5 wasn't doing much but I saw that 13... Bxe3 14. Bxe3 Bxh3! 15. gxh3 Qxh3 leaves white's king dangerously exposed with black's remaining forces in an excellent position to mate the poorly defended king."

I took a long think on this one -- it takes some guts psychologically to sacrifice material especially hard-won material but it seemed like the best move in this position.  Black's recapture is forced otherwise he loses his queen and after 18. gxf3 Bxf3 white's king is trapped and exposed.

761,29,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Rather than developing while defending with Nc6 Black decides to solidify his pawn structure while opening lines for the queen's bishop.
762,29,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',Baker loves positions with wide open tactics so naturally he would want to open up the centre.
763,29,5,exd4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black's other options are Bg4 and Nd7. Bg4 is complex and very tactical while Nd7 is more passive but safer.

Usual is 3... d5 which is a ""falkbeer counter-gambit"" type response and play usually continues 4. fxe5 Nxe4 and then white can choose between 5. Nf3 and 5. d3 both of which are about even."
785,30,4,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',!  The best move although it's pretty obvious after the last note.

It takes some major cojones to sacrifice a knight so early in the game and for just a pawn but take stock of developed pieces and you'll see that white isn't losing at all...

But with white in total command of the center there's then no good answer to d5.  Black sees that 9. Bxh6 Nxh6 defends the f7 square but white is going after bigger stakes than just a minor piece.
795,30,14,Bc4,b'rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/7b/4P3/2BP1B2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq -',More development!  Now if the Bf4 moves there's a mate threat on f7.

Therefore we have to conclude that the plan of taking the knight Muzio-style in the vienna gambit accepted is simply too slow and black cannot afford the time lost.

What can black do at this point?  It's easy to see that many things don't work: Bxf4 fails to 12. Qxf4 Nd7 fails to 12. exd6  and Ne7 fails to 12. Bxh6.

I had thought that black would at least move a piece or try to complicate something by returning material or sacrificing his queen.  Instead white's plan of exf6  can continue unhindered.

803,30,22,1Bg6,b'rn1q1knr/pp3p1p/2pP2bb/4B3/2BP4/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - -',This defends the f7 pawn once jettisoning the rook in the hopes of living to fight a little longer...

Thanks to Vidas for the game and the lesson is twofold -- don't accept the vienna gambit with exf4 and don't go grabbing material when you're behind in development!  Hope you enjoyed this one!"

White's mistake by deciding to retreat the knight to g3 cleared the path for Black to win. Remember if you move try to do so with a threat so that your opponent can't build his game at your expense.

914,39,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is the first time I annotate one of my games. I guess it might be an interesting game at least for someone who's rating is lower than mine. It might as well sound ridiculous for a very experienced player.
915,39,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',This game was part of a mini-tournament with the title: Play your favourite variation of the Sicilian Defense.

Forgive me if I choose to annotate the game I've won rather than the lost one..."
917,39,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Larry is a strong player even if his rating might be a few points lower than mine. Also after my first defeat I already would have been happy to achieve a draw in the second one.
918,39,4,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',"I'm heading for the Sveshnikov which is my favorite variation of the Sicilian when playing black. The characteristic move is 
5.) ...e5. I won't tell you more about this opening as you can find better explanations in books."
919,39,5,cxd4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Also I will leave you alone till move 19 when I finally deviate from the Gameknot data base.

921,39,7,1Rxa4,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/p2pb3/3Np3/R7/2P5/1P2BPPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',"Here my predecessor (the only one left at this point and always according to the gameknot data base) played 19.) ...Rxb2 
20.) Bxa6 which did not show very good results. So I decide to keep my a pawn for a while and try to keep the a file closed."
922,39,8,1a5,b'1r1q1rk1/5pbp/3pb3/p2Np3/R7/2P5/1P2BPPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',My first own move in this game!
923,39,9,Kh8,b'1r1q1r1k/5pbp/3pb3/3Np3/1R6/2P5/4BPPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Makes place - eventually - for Rg8 and prevents the risk of check when the white queen eventually comes to d5 (after ...Bxf5 Qxd5).
924,39,10,f5,b'1r1q1r1k/6bp/3pb3/3Npp2/1R6/2PQ4/4BPPP/5RK1 w - f6',Because I plan to push forward my f pawn anyway. Whites move aimed at h7 and
925,39,11,2Rfb1,b'1r1q1r1k/6bp/3pb3/3Npp2/1R6/2PQ4/4BPPP/1R4K1 b - -',gave way for 23.) Rf-b1 which doubles the rooks on the b-file.
926,39,12,2cxb4,b'3q1r1k/6bp/3pb3/3Npp2/1P6/3Q4/4BPPP/1R4K1 b - -',Now white has a very dangerous passed pawn supported by his rook. At this point my reasoning was: Should I try to attack the passed pawn? I guess I would have ended up with a very defensive play. So I opted for a kingside attack hoping it would be strong enough before white's b-pawn arrives on the b8 square.
927,39,13,2e4,b'3q1r1k/6bp/3pb3/3N1p2/1P2p3/3Q4/4BPPP/1R4K1 w - -',Makes way for the bishop winning the tempo. Maybe white's 22.) Qd3 wasn't so good after all.
928,39,14,2b5,b'3q1r1k/7p/3pb3/1P1Nbp2/4p3/8/4BPPP/1R1Q2K1 b - -',The b-pawn on his way like the sword of Damocles (for those who know the ancient Greek legend or at least The Rocky Horror Picture Show...)
929,39,15,2Qg5,b'5r1k/7p/3pb3/1P1Nbpq1/4p3/8/4BPPP/1R1Q2K1 w - -',But the kingside attack is also on her way.
930,39,16,2Bf1,b'5r1k/7p/3pb3/1P1Nb1q1/4pp2/6P1/5P1P/1R1Q1BK1 b - -',I guess Larry defends rather well.
931,39,17,Bxg3,b'5r1k/7p/3pb3/1P1N2q1/4p3/6b1/5P2/1R1Q1BK1 w - -',In such situations I guess you simply HAVE to sacrifice a piece if it allows to destroy the king's defense .
932,39,18,3fxg3,b'5r1k/7p/3pb3/1P1N2q1/4p3/6P1/8/1R1Q1BK1 b - -',Now I had planned 30. ...Qxg3  31. Kh1 Rf2 and black wins. Only in the very last moment I have realized that unfortunately after 30. ...Qxg3 white has Bg2 and Larry is only waiting for it!
933,39,19,3Bxd5,b'5r1k/7p/3p4/1P1b2q1/4p3/6P1/8/1R1Q1BK1 w - -',Happily I can grab the knight and now I'm one pawn up.
934,39,20,3Qd4+,b'5r1k/7p/3p4/1P1b2q1/3Qp3/6P1/8/1R3BK1 b - -',Tears the king out of his corner. Bye bye the hope of doubling on the g file with ...Rg8.
935,39,21,3Bg2,b'5rk1/7p/3p4/1P1b2q1/3Qp3/6P1/6B1/1R4K1 b - -',Attacks the pawn on e4 the Bd5 (indirectly)  protects the kings position and finally this is the best diagonal for white's Bishop.
936,39,22,3Rb8,b'1r4k1/7p/3p4/1P1b2q1/3Qp3/6P1/6B1/1R4K1 w - -',I want to bring my king in the game which is impossible with the rook on f8 because after 32. ...Kf7 33. Rf1  and the exchange of the rooks I guess the passed pawn would win the game.
937,39,23,3b6,b'1r4k1/7p/1P1p4/3b2q1/3Qp3/6P1/6B1/1R4K1 b - -',Which is still on his way anyway.

942,39,28,3Ke6,b'1r6/7p/1P1pk3/3b2q1/4p3/6P1/1Q4B1/5RK1 w - -',This is the only move.
943,39,29,3Qd4,b'1r6/7p/1P1pk3/3b2q1/3Qp3/6P1/6B1/5RK1 b - -',Now white has centralized his queen.
944,39,30,3h5,b'1r6/8/1P1pk3/3b2qp/3Qp3/6P1/6B1/5RK1 w - h6',I was hoping for white to grab the e pawn with 38. Bxe4 after which black can play ...Qxf3  39. Kh1 Qh4  winning the bishop with 40. Kg1 Bxe4. But of couse Larry is too clever. Still the h pawn moving up might be a threat for the white's king position later on.
945,39,31,3Bh3+,b'1r6/8/1P1pk3/3b2qp/3Qp3/6PB/8/5RK1 b - -',Larry has his own attack in mind. One should always look out for possible checks that the opposant has in hand. I had totally missed this one.
946,39,32,3Ke7,b'1r6/4k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/3Qp3/6PB/8/5RK1 w - -',The only move if I don't want to loose my queen.
947,39,33,3Qc3,b'1r6/4k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/4p3/2Q3PB/8/5RK1 b - -',Simply threatening Qc7  winning black's rook and I guess mating soon afterwards. 
948,39,34,3Rb7,b'8/1r2k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/4p3/2Q3PB/8/5RK1 w - -',What else could I do?
949,39,35,4Bc8,b'2B5/1r2k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/4p3/2Q3P1/8/5RK1 b - -',Now the rook has no place to go and white seems to have won the game but...
950,39,36,4e3,b'2B5/1r2k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/8/2Q1p1P1/8/5RK1 w - -',"this move threatens Qxg3  (the pawn is no longer protected by the queen) it also opens the diagonal for black's Bishop (finally! and only because white's bishop has given up this diagonal for the purpose of his own attack). And of course: threatens mate.

951,39,37,4Qe1,b'2B5/1r2k3/1P1p4/3b2qp/8/4p1P1/8/4QRK1 b - -',Protects pawn g3 but now black can take the pawn on b6 which once was white's greatest pride.
952,39,38,4Rxb6,b'2B5/4k3/1r1p4/3b2qp/8/4p1P1/8/4QRK1 w - -',At this moment I thought: Ok not only I am 2 pawns up but also one of them has reached the third rank white's king is still in danger and I have all my time to advance my pawns. I had not at all foreseen Larry's next move:
953,39,39,4Rf5,b'2B5/4k3/1r1p4/3b1Rqp/8/4p1P1/8/4Q1K1 b - -',"the rook is protected by the bishop on c8. After chasing the queen he threatens to win the bishop and if black defends with 
42. ...Qg8 white can take the pawn on e3 with check keeping his own pawn protected and threatening to take black's rook on b6. So after 43. Qxe3  Be6 black still might have an advantage but is only 1 pawn up. But black has a better solution:"
954,39,40,4Rb1,b'2B5/4k3/3p4/3b1Rqp/8/4p1P1/8/1r2Q1K1 w - -',"Now ironically none of black's pieces is protected and white can simply take the rook on b1 keeping his own rook protected by both the bishop and the queen. But: After 43. Qxb1 follows 43. ...Qxg3  44. Kf1 (the only move) and white has no defense against 44. ...Bc4  45. Qd3 Bxd3 mate.
Whereas after 43. Rxg5 follows 43. ...Rxe1  44. Kh2(only move) Rh1 mate.
A surprising end isn't it?
Hope you enjoyed it a little and you don't mind my bad english... Good luck wherever you are! "
