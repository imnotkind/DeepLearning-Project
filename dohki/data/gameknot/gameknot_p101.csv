39,1,0,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A little subtlety I learned from US Chess Championship Live Streams. This way I will force Nc3 before exchanging on d5 because if he has his Knight on b1 he could immediately decide for Nd2-c4. Why should I let my opponent carry out his plans effortlessly?
40,1,1,exd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pp4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Now that he played Nc3 I can exchange.

42,1,3,Nxc4,b'1rbqr1k1/5pbp/p2p2p1/3P4/2n1NP2/8/1P2B1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Forced because Rxe4? Na5! and White is much better.
43,1,4,1Be2,b'1rbq2k1/5pbp/p2p2p1/3P4/4rP2/8/1P2B1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - -',I was surprised by this move in my analysis I considered more Re1 and Qc2. This looks just like a loss of a tempo.
44,1,5,1Bxb2,b'1rbq2k1/5p1p/p2p2p1/3P4/4rP2/8/1b2B1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - -',Gaining a pawn even if at the cost of my dark-squared bishop. If White wants to regain the pawn will run into the worse endgame I saw analyzing this position.
45,1,6,2Bxb2,b'1rbq2k1/5p1p/p2p2p1/3P4/4rP2/8/1B2B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - -',Wouldn't have made such a big difference 20. Rb1 Reb4.
46,1,7,Ree2,b'3q2k1/5p1p/R2p2p1/3P4/5P2/8/1r2r1PP/3Q1R1K w - -',This is a much better endgame for Black because he has two active rooks on the 7th rank. White will be forced to place a rook on g1 where it won't affect the game for a long time.
47,1,8,Qc3,b'8/5pkp/3p2p1/3P4/R4P2/2q5/1r2r1PP/3Q2RK w - -',Accepting the exchange of Queens because I evaluated that the endgame with passive King and Rook was almost lost for White.

In this case it is particularly good because Red2 or Rbd2 would have led to a draw after Rxd2 Rxd2 Re1 Rxd5 g3 and the endgame 4v3 is a draw."
49,1,10,Kf5,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P1k2/5P2/8/1r2r1PP/3R2RK w - -',Continuing to activate my King because Rd2 draws similarly to last move variations.
50,1,11,2Rde1,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P1k2/5P2/8/1r2r1PP/4R1RK b - -',A desperate move in a desperate position Rf1 wouldn't have helped because of Rf2 and the gain of the f4 pawn anyway.
51,1,12,2Kxf4,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P4/5k2/8/1r2r1PP/4R1RK w - -',In order to snatch the pawn Black has to see Rxe2 Rxe2 Rf1 Ke5 Rxf7?? Re1+.
52,1,13,Kg4,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P4/6k1/6P1/4r2P/6RK w - -',Going for the h2 pawn.
53,1,14,3Rg2,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P4/6k1/6P1/4r1RP/7K b - -',The pawn endgame is lost but playing something else wouldn't have saved the game either.
54,1,15,Kf5,b'8/5p1p/3p2p1/3P1k2/8/6P1/6KP/8 w - -',
55,2,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',Right now Mr. Stockel is wants to play the Queen's Gambit and I will accept it.
56,2,1,dxc4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',This is why.  I thought that I could keep this pawn.  Why?  I believed that I would play b5 after he played e3 to win that pawn.  Afterall that is how I lost a team game against id=albinim.  In that game however I was white and after 2...dxc4 3...b5 had been played.  Therefore it became very similar to the Benko Gambit.  
57,2,2,a4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/P1pP4/8/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq a3',However he responded with this move and told me that 3.a4 is what prevents from keeping that extra pawn.  Later on I tried to play similar in order to keep that pawn but he said that it was no use.  Why?  That pawn was gone anyhow so it is best to just let it go.  Afterall the Queen's Gambit is a very well known opening and many Grandmasters play this.
58,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/P1pP4/8/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Now I asked him the following question.  Since you are getting that pawn anyway should I bring out my Knight.  Afterall this is what I would normally play during the Queens Gambit if the opponent tries to win back the pawn after stopping it with 3...b5.  He said that this move is still best as it develops.
59,2,4,e3,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/P1pP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Now he told me that if I had been able to keep the pawn he would have played Nf3 for development and to put on the b file.  However this move will knock my c4 pawn off the board.  This way everything is even given that I won the pawn earlier.  So like most Queen Gambits Accepted this is also not a true gambit.
60,2,5,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/8/P1pP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',I spoke to Jack before playing this move and he said that it was ok.  Of course I also could developed my LSB if I had wanted to castle Queenside.  However he told me that it is generally safer to castle Kingside then Queenside as castling Queenside often leaves the King exposed.
61,2,6,g6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/8/P1BP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',From here on in I cannot remember what exactly was played but I know that some of these positions are going to be very similar to what we reviewed.  In the meantime my goal is to fianchetto the DSB so that I can castle Kingside and Jack does not see anything wrong with this.
62,2,7,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/8/P1BP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',In fact his goal is the same as my goal in this position.
63,2,8,Bg7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/8/P1BP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Now he and I are both going to castle on the next move.
64,2,9,Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/8/P1BP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',"So he wants to kick my f6 Knight but his DSB is blocked by my e3 pawn.  That is why it is generally a bad idea to block in your own pieces according to Mr. Stockel and I agree with this assessment.  However ""There is always an exception to everything"" as id=chesskingdom64 would say and this is one of them.  Note: In the Queens Gambit e3 is often played.  Instead he is going to develop his other Knight.  Right now he wants to get the DSB so that he can complete his development."
65,2,10,Nb4,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/PnBP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',As noted earlier I cannot remember the exact positions after he wins the Queen.  However I think that this gets played because I want to bring the LSB on f5 so that his DSB gets attacked.  According to Jack Stockel this is my first mistake because I am bringing my Knight and position in a place where he can cram it.  In other words this leaves my position vulnerable.
66,2,11,Bd2,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/PnBP4/2N1PN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"Therefore he decides to take advantage by continuing development while I wasted some of that on 8...Nb4.  Afterall he has said ""Think about things"" and to think before you make a move.  Because there are negative consequences to the mistakes."
67,2,12,Nd3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/P1BP4/2NnPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',?? Because his DSB is placed directly in front of the Queen I see nothing wrong with this move.  Afterall I am trying to win his b2 Knight but like most games I am not thinking ahead.  According to Mr. Stockel this move will eventually loose the game.  Note: He is thinking about 10 steps ahead.  He shows me where this will happen.  First he is going to win the Knight after 10.Bxd3 and this is a move that I had overlooked.  Note: this game took place about a year ago.  And it happened before my annotation about overlooking moves.  In addition he will have a strong bishop pair and that is just the beginning.
68,2,13,Bg4,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/P2P2b1/2NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',Now I figure that I am going to correct some of my blunders by pinning his f3 Knight.  According to my coach however this is just a waste of time as that pin can easily be broken with 11.Be2 so this is just a nuisance pin.
69,2,14,Nd5,b'r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/P2P2b1/2N1PN2/1P1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',"In my opinion that Knight has caused a lot of problems so I just want to exchange.  However he told me that this is another mistake because I am behind and when you are down in material you generally do not want to exchange as most are just even exchanges.  So he will exchange as this benefits his position.  Note: Right now he is saying ""Thing about things"".  "
70,2,15,1Qc2,b'r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3q4/P2P2b1/4PN2/1PQBBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',In this position he is finishing development and that is all he wants.  However he wants a lot more then that.  
71,2,16,1Rfd8,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3q4/P2P2b1/4PN2/1PQBBPPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I figured that I would give my Queen support.  However it does not need protection because it is not hanging.  At the time I did not realize it so he showed what will happen in this position?  What are his intentions?
72,2,17,1Bc4,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3q4/P1BP2b1/4PN2/1PQB1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',Because my Queen is in a vulnerable position he decides to attack in the worst way and I cannot take because his Queen is protected by the LSB.  This is what he had planned since 13.Qc2 but I did not see through because I was only thinking move by move.
73,2,18,1Qd6,b'r2r2k1/ppp1ppbp/3q2p1/8/P1BP2b1/4PN2/1PQB1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',"I don't want to go the distance so I only retreat my Queen by one square but this is a blunder.  Instead why not 14...Qd7 or 14...Qc6.  They certainly would have been better then this move because he is going to take advantage of this error with 15.Qe4 and I can't defend 15...f5 as that would be an illegal move.  At this point I am thinking about resigning but Mr. Stockel said ""Don't give up right away"".  In fact he at one point told me that I always want to resign.  In addition a loosing does not necessarily mean that a game is lost.  For example after the blunder your opponent might make a mistake that will enable you to win or get a draw."
74,2,19,Bd7,b'r2r2k1/pppbppbp/3q2p1/8/P1BPQ3/4PN2/1P1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',So I am now forced to retreat my DSB while he comes up with plans to win this game. 
75,2,20,1Ng5,b'r2r2k1/pppbppbp/3q2p1/6N1/P1BPQ3/4P3/1P1B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',So he decides to move his Knight.  What would have happened if he had left it there?  I would have attacked it with 16...Bg4 so that would force him to undevelop his Knight if he was to keep it safe.  He saw through that and was not going to allow that.  I had a different idea however.  What was it?  In addition I do not know the other half because he has other plans as we will find out later on.
76,2,21,1Qb6,b'r2r2k1/pppbppbp/1q4p1/6N1/P1BPQ3/4P3/1P1B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Because I lost a Knight earlier I try to get something back.  Therefore I decide to attack his b2 pawn.  However that does not bother him because he will defend it with 17.b4.  That however will give him another edge.  Why?  My queen will be close to trapped and in a very vulnerable position after 17.b4
77,2,22,Qd6,b'r2r2k1/pppbppbp/3q2p1/6N1/PPBPQ3/4P3/3B1PPP/R4RK1 w - -',Now the game is lost for white.  At first he did not see it but Jack Stockel does something that I do not see.  In this position what is he going to do?
78,2,23,1Bxf7+,b'r2r2k1/pppbpBbp/3q2p1/6N1/PP1PQ3/4P3/3B1PPP/R4RK1 b - -',"This is it.  He decides to place me in check with this move.  Now my King is exposed and mate is almost inevitable.  After this move he accepted resignation by saying ""Now you can resign"".  He said that I went wrong when I blundered my Knight.  In other words 9...Nd3?? was the decisive mistake.  After that I weakened my position and had allowed him to expose my King like this.  Therefore this was planned ever since I made that mistake.  He actually showed me how he had planned that far ahead.  As he would say ""It's not so easy"".  Once again I do not remember the exact positions after the beginning because I was at a small table so there was not enough room to take notes. However this is related and similar to the position after the Queen's Gambit.  This is also where he taught me that small details make a huge difference in a chess game."
79,3,0,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',A master knows more understands more and calculates better.So what to play?Best to stick with ones usual openings.

118,5,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',as he went out with Nc6 its a opening I am not used too so I won't lie I used the Gameknot database to see which move fits best and what my choices are.
119,5,2,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',and that is yet a simple response and I wasn't even sure that it was the best move.

125,6,0,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',The Sicilian Defense is probably the best example to illustrate the advances and progress in chess opening theory over the years. By advancing the c-pawn two squares Black asserts control over the d4 square and fights for the center. Once thought to be passive it has grown to become one of the most combative options for Black. The queenside pawn advance provides a local spatial advantage - breaking symmetry early which will influence development for both sides providing both flexibility and a latent power.
126,6,1,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',With 2.Nf3 White intends to play d4 opening the d-file and taking charge in the center not with two pawns on e4/d4 but with a pawn and a knight with open lines and natural squares for piece development.
127,6,2,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Perhaps the most natural developing move preparing Nf6 without committing to a particular pawn structure although this is hardly a neutral move.
128,6,3,d4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',White thrusts forward to initiate the exchange.
129,6,4,Nf6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Black begins to fight back with this developing move aiming at the unprotected e-pawn which in turn leads to the natural Nc3 to develop and protect.
130,6,5,e5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq e6',The Sveshnikov (Lasker-Pelikan) variation. Black immediately fixes the pawn formation in the center with the seemingly anti-positional ...e5 which leaves Black with a backwards d-pawn and weakness on d5. At one point this move was regarded as a clumsy minor variation but the efforts of Evgeny Sveshnikov confident in the correctness of the strong pawn center have propelled this to one of the most influential variations of the Sicilian Defense. It has become popular due to the sheer inexhaustible resilience of Black's position which suggests that the harder White hits the harder Black hits back yet White cannot afford to play passively. 
131,6,6,Ndb5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The theoretically critical move which threatens Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality if not the advantage. 6.Nb3/Nf3 are met by 6...Bb4 threatening to win the e-pawn. 6.Nf5 allows the powerful 6...d5. And 6.Nxc6 is met with 6...bxc6 where the extra pawn in the center gives good play.
132,6,7,d6,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',By moving the pawn forward protected by the Queen Black does not allow 7.Nd6+ Bxd6 8.Qxd6.
133,6,8,Nd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N1Np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',The classical variation is to play the aggressive Bg5 to strengthen the grip on d5 and introduce the possibility of taking the knight forcing Black to take back with the g-pawn (where the doubled f-pawns have been demonstrated to be a dangerous weapon by Black). 7.Nd5 is the main alternative where White uses his control over d5 to bring about a change in the pawn formation where he is banking on the queenside pawn majority to be of more importance that Black's central advantage.
134,6,9,Nxd5,b'r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np4/1N1np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',As both of White's Knights were controlling the forking square of c7 Black must accept the exchange.
135,6,10,Nb8,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Another seemingly unnatural move - Black's knight has been kicked from c6 and retreats to redeploy at d7.
136,6,11,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq c3',White here has a number of options (c4 a4 c3 and Qf3) with c4 remaining as the most popular to work the queenside pawn mass and consolidate the position.
137,6,12,Be7,b'rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq -',Both Black and White's next few moves are quite natural - Black will play Be7/Nd7/O-O while White develops his King's bishop to castle as well.
138,6,13,Nd7,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Bringing the Knight back into the game to the best available square with the ability to jump to the important f6/e5/c5/b6 squares as required.
139,6,14,1b3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/1P6/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',With this move White develops a strong queenside pawn chain giving his Queen's bishop extra options for development.
140,6,15,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/1P6/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Black intends to fight back through the Kingside but first kicks back the aggressively posted knight.
141,6,16,f5,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1nb1pp/p2p4/3Ppp2/2P5/1PN5/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - f6',Black begins to work the Kingside using the f-pawn either for direct attack or securing the space advantage.

To immediately take is a mistake that allows White to further develop resulting in the d-pawn isolani and to immediately advance leaves Black with a somewhat cramped and awkward position.
143,6,18,1Bf6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p1n2pp/p2p1b2/3Ppp2/2P2P2/1PN5/P3B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',The best move I felt allowing White to initiate the exchange but improving the development  of Black's pieces giving the bishop more scope.

146,6,21,1Ba3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p4pp/p2p1b2/3Pnp2/2P5/BPN5/P3B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',White looks to load up on the weak d-pawn but misses the threat of Nxc4. Better would have been perhaps the simple Qc2. Once the a1-h8 diagonal is cleared out with Black's bishop remaining White's dark squared bishop will be quite limited.
147,6,22,1Bxc4,b'r1bq1rk1/1p4pp/p2p1b2/3P1p2/2B5/BPN5/P5PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',17.bxc4 Bxc3 18.Rc1 Be5 was perhaps a stronger alternative for White.

149,6,24,1Rf3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p4pp/p2p4/3Pbp2/2B5/BP3R2/P5PP/2RQ2K1 b - -',Lifting the rook although I'm not certain what the purpose of this was. Stronger and simpler in my opinion would have been Re1 to take the other file (perhaps allowing his dark squared bishop to be free due to it's pin on the rook through the d-pawn which could be decoyed through Rxe5)

However black really doesn't have any way to take advantage of this as of current and will most likely need to move the knight in order to make a breakthrough.  My goals are going to be getting my lsb out from its square on b1 since all the pawns are guarding my squares.  A good way to do this would to break open the board with f5.  Really none of my pieces are that bad since the action is going to most likely take place on the king side and all my pieces are slicing though it.

300,13,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"My opponent is White from The Team Scotland Forever. I play the Highland Bagpipes and my favorite to play is ""Flower of Scotland"" along with ""Scotland the Brave"" and ""Mist Covered Mountains.""
My esteemed opponent uses kmcl as his monicker; but like my own monicker we have reasons to choose a monicker when playing in GK!
Kmcl is better known as Ken McLean. He is from the Isle of Islay in the United Kingdom. He is 55 and I am 54 (until I go 55 on the 17th of December).  Go to Ken's Player profile and see him across a board of chess and the pint of the best! 

Ken opens e4 according to Scotland the Brave! E4 is my preference for being bold and to the point. It is also brave because who ever is across the board has the Ruy or Sicilian or French or Alekhine's or Caro-Kann or others to respond. E4 is brave because it means knowing how to respond to ALL of the above for success. 

I like Ken and feel with his history and profile we are of kin. I like him just by looking at his profile. I review his history. 
In the review I feel I can use my favorite Black Defense against e4 White Open: The Caro-Kann (which I learned in Seminary after playing against a blind seminarian who used it against me! note: pay attention to the opposition's defense against YOUR favorite open--I did and learned more from that game than most games I've played. And my opponent was BLIND). "

I had not really encountered it before and when this happened to me I thought my blind seminarian was perhaps behind the grand Sicilian and the vaunted French Defense and the common slow Ruy Lopez.  I felt sorry for him after he made that move in seminary but now I know why the Blind Man knew some things I needed to learn; mainly the Caro-Kann Defense. 
I am not blind and move Caro-Kann. "

I CAN put him on e6 to threaten a2 pawn--but that really isn't a big enough threat to block Field Artillery on the e rank.

343,14,1,b3,b'rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This seemed the most solid reply.  But 5. Qa4 is certainly possible too.  But I decided in favor of 5. b3 because it maximizes the misplacement of Black queen's bishop on a6.
344,14,2,Bd6,b'rn1qk2r/p1pp1ppp/bp1bpn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I have never seen the Black king's bishop placed here before and I saw no game of my opponent where she made this move. It prevents the freeing move ....d5 but it allows the Black queen some freedom to go to e7 and later dictate some pawn moves in the center.
345,14,3,1Nxc6,b'r4rk1/pbppqppp/1pNbpn2/8/2PP4/1P4P1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - -',The computer recommended 10. e4 Bxe5 11. dxe5 Ne8 12. Nd2 d6 13. exd6 cxd6 14. Nf3 Nf6 15. Qe2 Rac8 16. Rad1 Nb4 17. Bxf6 gxf6 with a slight edge to White. But my motive for 10. Nxc6 was simply to double the c-pawns which I expected to exploit later. I think this turned out to be the right strategy and it kept me from losing the game later.

351,14,9,2Kc3,b'5rk1/p1p2ppp/2p5/8/3Qp3/1PK1P1P1/P1R2q2/8 b - -',My king will develop into my most valuable fighting piece. Believe it or not my king will end up back on the king side eventually.
352,14,10,3Qf4,b'3r2k1/p1p2pp1/2p5/7p/5Q2/1P2P1q1/PKR5/8 b - -',I hated to trade queens.  But I saw no easy way to prevent the Black horde of connected king side pawns unless I got at least one pawn in front of them. The queen exchange accomplishes that. The computer now rates this position as -3.38 against me.  But we are only halfway through this game believe it or not.
353,14,11,3b4,b'8/p1p2p1k/2p3p1/3r3p/1P3P2/2K5/P6R/8 b - -',I might as well advance these queen side pawns.  They will turn out to be the only advantage I have in this game.
354,14,12,3Rf5,b'8/p1p2p1k/2p3p1/5r1p/1P3P2/2K5/P6R/8 w - -',I was a bit surprised by this move.  Is Black letting my king back over into the king side?
355,14,13,Rd5+,b'8/p1p2p2/8/1Ppr2kp/2R5/3K4/P7/8 w - -',This is a bit of a mistake since my king can now enter the action on the king side.  The computer prefers 41...h4 42. Rc2 h3 43. Re2 Kf4 44. Rf2+ Kg4 45. Re2.
356,14,14,4a4,b'8/p1p5/8/1Ppr1pk1/P1R4p/5K2/8/8 b - a3',The computer prefers 44. Ra4 Rd3+ 45. Kg2 f4 46. Rxa7 f3+ 47. Kf2 Kf4 48. Rxc7 Rd2+ 49. Kg1 Rg2+ 50. Kh1 Rxa2 51. Rf7+ Kg3 52. Rg7+ Kh3 53. Kg1 Rb2 54. Kf1.  Still a losing position of course.
357,14,15,4a6,b'8/p1p5/P7/1Ppr2k1/2R2p2/5K1p/8/8 b - -',The computer calls this a mistake.  With best play (starting 46. Rc2 Kf5 47. Rc1 Rd3+ 48. Ke2 c4 49. Kf2 Rd2+ 50. Kg1 f3 51. Rxc4 Rd1+ 52.

358,14,16,5Kf2,b'8/p1p5/P7/1Pp2k2/5p2/3r3p/2R2K2/8 b - -',The computer also calls this a mistake.  But the best alternative it gives (50. Ke2 h2 51. Rc1 Ke4 52. Rh1 Ra3 53. Kd2 c4) is just as dismal. The computer now rates this position -8.75 against me. 
359,14,17,5Rf7,b'8/5R2/P7/1P6/6k1/8/3r1p1p/7K b - -',The computer does not like this move much. Bur all variations that I see now come down to what actually happens here in this position.
360,14,18,5a7,b'8/P7/8/1P6/6k1/8/7K/5r2 b - -',"And just like that Black has a host of problems now to deal with.  The only advantage Black has is with the rook being sufficient to deliver mate but that happens only if Black can pin my king to the edge of the board and then place the rook at a distance in order to mate.  Note that Reuben Fine in his classic work ""Basic Chess Endings"" refers to endings with 2 connected passed pawns versus rook in the absence of kings as being a win only if the pawns are both on the sixth rank but otherwise lose.  Here the pawns are in a position to win outright but only if my king can avoid the non-stop checks by the rook and also the chance of being mated.  See diagram 291 (Keres-Eliskases Noordwijk 1938) as the typical drawing example.  Fine summarizes it: ""When the King of the Pawns is on or near the edge of the board the threat of checkmate may often be an adequate defense against two pawns on the sixth and seventh while if both pawns are on the sixth or one is on the seventh and the other on the fifth the Rook may even win."""
361,14,19,6b7,b'8/PP6/8/8/8/5k2/r7/6K1 b - -',Of course! Black cannot prevent both pawns from queening.  But Black does have a drawing trick.

A good game with lots of mistakes close shaves and me staring down the barrel of defeat most of the way."

366,15,2,d3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Here is a move that's somewhat unusual for me.  I usually like to play 2.Nc3 to get my knight out there but it didn't wind up making much of a difference in this game.
367,15,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Possibly the most common move I've seen from black in the King's pawn game.
368,15,4,Nf3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',My standard third move.  Good for development attacks the center forces black to keep protecting his pawn.  Sometimes I set up for 4.d4 and trade pawn and knights but that can wait.
369,15,5,d6,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Shoring up the protection on his pawn.  Also opens up the diagonal for his light bishop.  Pretty common move.
370,15,6,Bg5,b'r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p1B1/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',This is a move with very little upside.  I've done it a few times to try to catch someone off guard and take their queen but no one has ever fallen for it.  The most common defense is 4...f6 which usually sends my bishop scampering back to e3 and gives black the tempo advantage.  The only thing my move does is discourage a king side castle but really nothing else.
371,15,7,Be7,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp1bppp/2np4/4p1B1/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He protects his queen with his bishop.  I think that he was trying to force my bishop back while developing his but I think that this move just encourages a trade that doesn't have any real benefit for black.  4...f6 was the better move.
372,15,8,Bxe7,b'r1bqk1nr/ppp1Bppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',I take the trade.  Maybe not the best move in this situation but I decided to play it aggressive.
373,15,9,Ngxe7,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He finishes the trade with his knight.  This is probably his best move in this situation and gives him an advantage in tempo.  I really haven't done much so far.
374,15,10,d4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Now I set up for the pawn and knight trade.  the major benefit is that if he accepts I can take control of the a1-g8 diagonal with my queen but I also leave my queen out in the center unprotected.  Bit of a double-edged sword.
375,15,11,exd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He accepts and starts a bloodbath for the next few moves.
376,15,12,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Continuing the trade.
377,15,13,Nxd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/3p4/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',He keeps it going.  This is the most common move but I have seen black play 7...Ne5 or just leave his knights as is and move a knight or light bishop.
378,15,14,Qxd4,b'r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq -',I finish the trade.  Phew.  That will be the last capture for a while now.
379,15,15,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ -',I'm not sure if I like the castle in this situation.  My queen is threatening g7 which could spell doom for black if he makes some very wrong moves.  I would've tried to drive the queen back first but honestly this seems like a harmless move.
380,15,16,Nc3,b'r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3p4/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ -',Now I start to actually develop my pieces starting with my knight.
381,15,17,c6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2pp4/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ -',He prevents what I would've liked to do next (10.Nd5) and opens up a diagonal for his queen.
382,15,18,1Bd3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2pp4/8/3QP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',Now I start my king side attack. Also opens up the king side castle in case I want to get my rook involved.
383,15,19,1c5,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p4/2p5/3QP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',I'm not sure why he took two moves to do this.  9...c5 would've forced the same dilemma for me and would've likely either knocked my queen further back or blocked my bishop.  Instead he sets me up for some nice attacking position.
384,15,20,1Qe3,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',I put my queen in the only place to save it from further harassment.
385,15,21,1a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2nppp/p2p4/2p5/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ -',He's setting up a pawn charge but I would've developed my bishop in this situation.
386,15,22,1O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2nppp/p2p4/2p5/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',I'm a fan of both the queen side castle and castling later in the game.  Waiting allows me to see how the board is developing and the queen side castle often gets the rooks involved faster.
387,15,23,1b5,b'r1bq1rk1/4nppp/p2p4/1pp5/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - b6',Here come the pawns.
388,15,24,1e5,b'r1bq1rk1/4nppp/p2p4/1pp1P3/8/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - -',I try to halt his pawn onslaught.  
389,15,25,1Bb7,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p2p4/1pp1P3/8/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - -',Now he takes control of the a8-h1 diagonal threatening my unprotected g2 pawn.
390,15,26,1Rhg1,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p2p4/1pp1P3/8/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',I protect my pawn and keep his bishop off my 2nd rank.
391,15,27,1b4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p2p4/2p1P3/1p6/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',He continues to march his pawns and threatens my knight.
392,15,28,1Ne4,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p2p4/2p1P3/1p2N3/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',I save my knight and keep it developed.  All my pieces are very concentrated in the center but I think that I have a definite advantage in my position right now.
393,15,29,1d5,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p7/2ppP3/1p2N3/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',I don't like this move.  While he keeps marching his pawns it gives me a prime opportunity to attack with my knight.
394,15,30,1Nf6+,b'r2q1rk1/1b2nppp/p4N2/2ppP3/1p6/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',Naturally I attack. I liked this move because it wrecked his defenses while opening up my light bishop.
395,15,31,1gxf6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2np1p/p4p2/2ppP3/1p6/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',He takes my bishop which was the best play in this scenario.  If he had played 16...Kh8 mate would have come fairly quickly.
396,15,32,1exf6,b'r2q1rk1/1b2np1p/p4P2/2pp4/1p6/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',Now his king is trapped and he can't take my pawn for at least two moves.
397,15,33,1Ng6,b'r2q1rk1/1b3p1p/p4Pn1/2pp4/1p6/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',Now he saves his knight attacks my pawn and protects his king.  Definitely the best move in this situation.
398,15,34,1Qg5,b'r2q1rk1/1b3p1p/p4Pn1/2pp2Q1/1p6/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',Now I launch my final assault.  I protect my pawn keeping the king trapped and put my queen into a very forward position.  Now it was only a matter of time until mate.
399,15,35,1c4,b'r2q1rk1/1b3p1p/p4Pn1/3p2Q1/1pp5/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',Here he threatens my bishop which is really all that he could do in this situation.  Now he's seriously getting hurt by his pawns which are blocking most of his other pieces.
400,15,36,1Bxg6,b'r2q1rk1/1b3p1p/p4PB1/3p2Q1/1pp5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',Now he's pretty screwed.
401,15,37,1Kh8,b'r2q1r1k/1b3p1p/p4PB1/3p2Q1/1pp5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',Here he made the wrong move.  Had he played 19...Qxf6 (20. Qxf6 hxg6) I would've had a much tougher time getting to the mate.
402,15,38,2Qh6,b'r2q1r1k/1b3p1p/p4PBQ/3p4/1pp5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',Now I've got mate in 1 no matter what he plays.
403,15,39,2fxg6,b'r2q1r1k/1b5p/p4PpQ/3p4/1pp5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 w - -',He strikes one final time but it's not quite enough.
404,15,40,2Qg7#,b'r2q1r1k/1b4Qp/p4Pp1/3p4/1pp5/8/PPP2PPP/2KR2R1 b - -',And mate.  I hope this was helpful to anyone reading it and please give me some feedback!

Black could have defended the pawn with a6 or he can even thought about to sac it with b4 at once while axb will be followed by d5 with no tempo loss because white has to care about his b4 pawn.

Pawnstar bravely took a gamble with his play but alas it backfired on him big time and he just did not know what had hit him!  So how did this happen.  Well here is the Gameknot Analysis version of Steve's game with JJ: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16113275&rnd=0.39385938457218183."
565,22,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',2. ..... Nf6 - Steve responds to e4 with Nf6 which is the Alekhine's Defense.  This defense was a firm favourite of Freddy the Master Mater - it is good to see such a not so well known opening get a following.
566,22,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',2. Nc3 - more usual is e5.
567,22,3,Bd3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',3. Bd3?! - blocking in the d3 pawn - although it develops a piece it indirectly blocks in the other bishop.  I think d3 was better here.
568,22,4,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/3pP3/3B4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq e6',4. ..... e5 - black keeps white bottled up.

570,22,6,Bxh3,b'rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1n2/4pN2/3pP2p/3B1N1b/PPPP1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',9. ...... Bxh3 - black decided to break up white's castled position this way because white's knight move to g3 allowed the knight on f3 to be pinned to but protected by his queen.   However can this sac be justified?  White declines the sac and takes off the h pawn instead.
571,22,7,1Be2,b'rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1n2/4p3/3pP1bN/5N2/PPPPBPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq -',11. Be2 - pin breaker.

I would have thought Nc6 followed by 0-0-0 was more conventional however.  This move has a double question mark because it drops at least the exchange as you will see.
575,22,11,1Ng5,b'rn1q3r/pppk1pp1/3b4/4p1N1/3pP1n1/3P4/PPP1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',14. Ng5! - counter-attack.  It is a nasty move for black to deal with as it discovers an attack on the g4 knight and threatens Nxf7 winning the exchange.
576,22,12,1Rh6,b'rn1q4/pppk1pp1/3b3r/4p1N1/3pP1n1/3P4/PPP1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',14. .... preparing for that line up but now it allows the loose knight on g4 to get pranged with check.
577,22,13,Kc6,b'rn1q4/ppp2pp1/2kb3r/4p1N1/3pP1B1/3P4/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',15. ..... Kc6 - the BK is further exposed.  Had it been my king Henry he would have been asking Glenda for his cloak!
578,22,14,1Nxf7,b'rn1q4/ppp2Np1/2kb3r/4p3/3pP1B1/3P4/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',16. Nxf7 - ouch and double ouch - here comes that dreaded fork and now black will be a whole rook down - horrible.
579,22,15,1Qh4,b'rn6/ppp2Np1/2kb3r/4p3/3pP1Bq/3P4/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',16. ...... Qh4 - white is in Old Matey's shadow but that is easily dealt with by that cadaverous white knight snapping off the hapless black rook on h6.
580,22,16,1Bd2,b'r7/pppn4/2kb3p/4p3/3pPPBq/3P4/PPPB2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - -',19. Bd2 - white completes his development.  If you look at the h column now you will notice that it will be very difficult for black to mount that counterplay down the h column because he has his own pawn there and he cannot take his own pawn.  Black is already lost.
581,22,17,2Be1,b'8/pppn4/2kbB2p/4p3/3pPP1q/3P2r1/PPP3P1/R2QBRK1 b - -',21. Be1 - skewer.
582,22,18,fxg3,b'8/pppn4/2kbB2p/8/3pP2q/3P2p1/PPP3P1/R2Q1RK1 w - -',22. .... fxg3 - again white is in Old Matey's shadow.  Luckily for him his bishop can go to h3 to shut out the BQ.  Steve will have to find another way.
583,22,19,2Qf3,b'8/ppp5/2kb1n1p/8/3pP2q/3P1QpB/PPP3P1/R4RK1 b - -',24. Qf3 - now the WQ comes on f3 and the f6 knight is under the hammer.
584,22,20,2e5+,b'8/ppp5/2k2n1p/4P3/3p1b1q/3P1QpB/PPP3P1/R4RK1 b - -',25. e5+ - and so the carnage continues.  A discovered check wins the knight on f6.
585,22,21,2e6,b'8/ppp5/2k1P2p/3n4/3p1b1q/3P1QpB/PPP3P1/R4RK1 b - -',26. e6 - and now it looks as though another WQ is gonna appear on the board - Holy Smoke! 
586,22,22,Kc6,b'3Q4/ppp1n3/2k1P2p/8/3p3q/3Pb1pB/PPP3P1/R4R1K w - -',29. .... Kc6 - and now a king hunt begins.
587,22,23,3Rxe7,b'8/pppQR3/1k2P2p/6q1/3p4/3Pb1pB/PPP3P1/R6K b - -',32. Rxe7 - another black piece drops and so will the queenside pawns.  Not long now - the BK will soon be subjected to a lawnmower mate.
588,22,24,3Qxa7+,b'8/Q3R3/4P2p/k5q1/3p4/3P2pB/PPP3P1/R1b4K b - -',35. Qxa7+ - after this move Steve resigns.  Not only does the BK have to face heavy white artillery from behind there is also that wall of white pawns.  I think that Steve overplayed his hand in this game with his attack and left too many loose pieces up for grabs.
589,23,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Stalhandske challenged me to a dual because in a early annotated game in which he was played the Alekine defense I made the pompous statement that Alekine defense was dead and a guaranteed win for white in all lines. So he challenged me to walk the talk and prove it.  FYI if there are many grammar and spelling mistake please excuse them as this was done in a rush. 
590,23,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"Black tempts white into advancing the e-pawn beyond the 4th rank in order to prove some time in the near future that white's ""big"" center is weak not strong. "

592,23,3,Nd5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',black has now wasted tempo by moving the knight twice. This is perfectly ok because White done the same thing by pushing the e-pawn and not developing pieces. 
593,23,4,d4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',White defends the e-pawn and tries to hang onto his space advantage in the center. 
594,23,5,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"This is the key that unlocks all of black's ""perceived"" problems. Now there is now way that white can hold onto the e-pawn which at once equalizes for black. "
595,23,6,Nf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',This is the modern approach to the Alekine. The traditional space hungry grab 4. c4 has fallen out of favor because white's already over extended pawn structure is over extended even more.  
596,23,7,dxe5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',Objective complete! Black has eliminates white's center superiority and the game is equal. I am not a fan of the main alternative 4. ...Bg4 5. Be2 e6 6. 0-0 in my view is more pleasant for white.  
597,23,8,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',This in hindsight was not as good as I thought. While it gains space at the expense of the knight it makes defending the d-pawn extremely difficult for white. 
598,23,9,e4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2PPp3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I like this move a lot!  Black counters white's threat with threatening to eliminate a key defender of d4 and allowing white to double up his pawns on the d-file.
599,23,10,cxd5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/3Pp3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Maybe this is not the best move but it still leaves me in charge in the center. The gameknot engine suggested 6. Ne5 as best. But here are my thoughts. I have already resigned to the fact that white has gained absolutely nothing from the opening. At this point I am visualizing how I might be able to make something happen on the king side. I see that first I must strengthen the D-pawn my last bastion in the center. Then I see the glimmer of excitement when I have a bishop on c2 and the queen on d3. But this is not enough in of itself. I must provoke black into making some positional concessions on the king side. So maybe Bg5 with the help of h4-h5 will be often to break the dead lock. 
600,23,11,Qxf3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/3P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq -',White still controls the center but has major positional weakness. 
601,23,12,c6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq -',Again black continues to pound away at white's center. I love the beautiful simplicity of black's strategic plan. 
602,23,13,Nc3,b'rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',With d4 being so weak the last thing I want to do is help black build pressure up against it. 8. dxc6 Nxc6 is in my view better for black this is what the gameknot engine suggested. 
603,23,14,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3P4/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq -',Now black threatens to solidify his stake in the center with ...cxd5. So this forces white to expose d4. 
604,23,15,dxe6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1P3/8/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq -',Since I have a choose on which piece black will develop I am going to choose the one that puts less pressure on d4. The gameknot engine disagrees slightly by suggesting that 9. dxc6 nxc6 10.d5!? is slightly in whites favor. This maybe true objectively but I am sensing that Stalhandske would do quite well in such open positions. Feeling this I decide to play the possibly inferior dxe6 in order to steer the game into where quiet positional maneuvering is required. I therefore make this move confidently that my positional skills are superior to Stalhandske's rewarding me with the mating opportunity that I dream about. 
605,23,16,1Be3,b'rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/3P4/2N1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq -',Stalhandske commented at this point during the game that he felt he had succeeded in proving that the Alekine defense is not dead. Myself of course with a lump in my throat had to agree. It is in my opinion that in this current position black is slightly better. He has no serious pawn weaknesses his pieces are able to mobilize freely and quickly. the only real drawback for black is that he has no real prospects of attack. This however did not discourage me I will continue on executing my term plans and rely on my strong positional skills to create some magic. I intend to do a dance(the shuffle) to reorganize my pieces put pressure on the king side. My fingers are crossed that Stalhandske will assist me by playing moves like ...h6 and maybe if I am so lucky ...g6. 
606,23,17,1Nd7,b'r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/3P4/2N1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq -',This knight is quite strong here where it eyes c5 and e5 and can possible go to d5 via b6 or f6

608,23,19,1Bb4,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq -',Now the game takes on a very masterful feel where both sides make small moves that have long term significant. It is important to note that neither side is looking for knock out blows( this is in stark contrast to amateur games where one side will make a ration move looking for that quick strike). it is here where the position is absolutely level where master games are won and lost. It is imperative to be patient make small improvements and make no weaknesses. With that said we can see that while 11. ...Bb4 is good it is not ideal because it is short sighted in that the pin on c3 is of no real consequence. So what is can black do to gain something down the road. Maybe the answer is 11. ...Bd6!? controlling the b8-h2 diagonal which will become really important 10 moves from now. 
609,23,20,1Be2,b'r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP2BPP1/R3K2R b KQkq -',I do not think black is too serious about capturing on c3 since it helps support the d-pawn. Now 12. Bd3 is short sighted since after 12. ...Nf6 13. 0-0 Nd5 black is creating magic on c3. By playing 12. Be2 I earn the right to castle but more critically I keep the 3rd rank clear to defend c3 with my queen rook and bishop. 
610,23,21,1Nf6,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP2BPP1/R3K2R w KQkq -',Now black maybe thinking of capturing on c3 with the support of ...Nd5. When Stalhandske played 11. ...Bb4 this is what I thought he might be up to. However I have already adequately made preparations for it well before he got up this morning!That is a joke a Stalhandske ;)  
611,23,22,1O-O,b'r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b kq -',Breaking the pin. 
612,23,23,1O-O,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 w - -',Now here I have to say that black is slightly better than white because of the weakness of the d-pawn. From here the game shifts into a quiet positional battle where each player seeks to slowly improve their pieces without creating any more weaknesses. My plan is to stack up my rooks on the e-file place the LSB on c2 with the support of the queen on d3 to eye h7 and g6 and play g4-g5 or h4-h5 to rattle black's cage in hopes of spooking him. It is a long shot I know but hey it is the best I got. 
613,23,24,1Bd3,b'r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/1b1P4/2NBBQ1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - -',With the king castled I no longer fear the capture on c3 as it no longer benefits black in anyway. Though it is still quite playable for black 
614,23,25,1Re8,b'r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/1b1P4/2NBBQ1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - -',Stalhandske like myself is seeking to steadily improve is his prospects.

But it has to be said that this is where it starts to go south for black. This is considered as a ""positional concession"" and one like this one is not too bad but the problem is that it is like kicking a hornets nest it causes more problems than it solves. In this game the hornets nest is the light square weakness on g6 and h7. "
620,23,31,1Bd2,b'r3r1k1/pp1q1pp1/2p1b2p/3n4/1b1P4/2N2Q1P/PPBB1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',now that the bishops mission of provoking ...h6 weakening g6 is a success it goes back to the defense of c3.

It is clear that black wants to keep his DSB. However on a5 it is less active and short sighted. It ignores the possibility of an attack on the king side via h4-h5 or g4-g5. Perhaps the idea behind Stalhandske's logical is that he intends to play ...Bc7 controlling the critical b8-h2 diagonal. If Stalhandske was thinking long term he maybe had opted for the prophylactic 18. ...Bf8 anticipating the impeding attack. 
622,23,33,1Qd3,b'r3r1k1/pp1q1pp1/2p1b2p/b2n4/3P4/2NQ3P/PPBB1PP1/R3R1K1 b - -',Of the two players I must say that white has improved his position much more than black. This is a result of the contrasting approaches to the position. Black who has chosen to active piece development that have immediate short term prospects is running out of useful moves. Furthermore his pieces are not as harmonious as their counterparts. Compared to white who has chosen to resist immediate attacking prospects for long term advantages. From here on out all of white's patient maneuvering begins to pay dividends as black now starts to scramble just to keep up with white.

This forces blacks hand as he can not allow white to control this diagonal. This is the germ seed of my ultimate plan of doubling my rooks on the e-file. I am envisioning a rook on e5 that ties black completely down. Yet I still can not see a clear line for a win.

630,23,41,2Rad8,b'3rr1k1/pp1q1pp1/2p1b2p/8/3PR3/3Q3P/PPB2PP1/4R1K1 w - -',Stalhandske also completes his positional maneuvering. However white has the edge due to the fact that his pieces are better coordinated and superior to their counterparts. Yet the edge is not enough to win because of the lack of exploitable weaknesses. This is not unusually in master games and it is one of the distinguishing features between a master game and an amateur game. When all things are equal the true strength is pulling a magic rabbit out of your hat.

I assume he wants to play ...Bc4 but I have something bigger in mind. I think to myself if I can get my rook on e5 then just maybe the support of Qg3 combined with either H4-h5 or Rh5 is looking pretty good for white. 
633,23,44,2Re4e5,b'3rr1k1/p2q1pp1/2p1b2p/1p2R3/3P3P/3Q4/PPB2PP1/4R1K1 b - -',This all but forces black to make a further concession in front of his king because he does not have a knight on f6 anymore thanks to 22. Ne4

Kh7(perhaps just seeing the immediate need to protect g6) in the first place or he just cracked under the mounting pressure. Now black can not stop the break through. Best was 28. ...Bf5 which is made possible because of the king on h7 which leads to a slight advantage for white.

On e3 the king will defend d4 and after f3-f4 white will end up with two past pawns for the win. Stalhandske resigns. In conclusion Stalhandske did prove that Alekine defense is still alive and doing well. However the true test of the Alekine test does not lay in the opening but in the ending. It has to be said that white does have most of the chances to win coming out of the opening. yet despite this advantage I am quite confident that I could have easily defended this game to a draw after 28. ...Bf5! In short this is a great defense for amateur players because of it's great defensive resources. Because of the rating difference it was up to me to prove that my positional skills were better than Stalhandske's. Had Stalhanske found and played 28. ...Bf5 then he would have achieved a great victory by achieving a draw over a player most likely 400 points north of his own.

Well here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18671614&rnd=0.48246097817512356.
