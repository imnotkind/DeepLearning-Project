35,1,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Good move.  Seizes central territory while opening d1-h5 diagonal for the queen and the f1-a6 diagonal for the bishop.
36,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Advanced strategy - for advanced players.  The idea is to tempt white into harassing the knight by pushing his pawns far out into the center.  These pawns Black hopes will later be weakened due to their advanced positions and the squares around them will be weakened too.  As a beginning player try to keep your pawns tight and compact.  Advance the e and d pawns (the king and queen pawns) but as a general rule the remaining pawns should not be moved unless necessary or if their movement is part of a concrete tactical shot or a concrete strategic idea.
37,1,2,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',White advances the pawn.  A good move only if he knows what he is doing and if he is confident that by advancing the pawn he can build a strong center that is defensible.   Remember that unnecessary pawn moves waste time.  Chess time must be used to get the pieces out of their starting position centralized and ready to take part in the action.
38,1,3,d6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',"A bad blunder!  Black gives up his Knight!  Remember a pawn is worth one ""point"".  A knight and bishop are both equal to three points; a rook is equal to five points and a queen is equal to nine points.  GameKnot calculates the point value for you."
39,1,4,exf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1P2/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',Obvious.
40,1,5,gxf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1p2/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',The best option.  As a general rule capture with pawns toward the center not away from it.  This move also opens the g file for his rook and it gives the f8 bishop some immediate squares to mobilize to.
41,1,6,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1p2/8/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq -',White immediately targets the f7 square - the Achilles heel of any chess position (f2 for white) because it has only one defender:  the king!  This move is tactically not the best simply because Black could advance his d pawn thus pushing the Bishop away (and gaining time).  Other options for Black are to mobilize his c8 bishop to e6 thus countering the white Bishop or he could go for a compact pawn structure by advancing the e-pawn one square to e6 thus blunting the white Bishop's scope.
42,1,7,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2np1p2/8/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq -',Not a bad move - Black gets a piece off the first rank (finally).
43,1,8,Nf3,b'r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2np1p2/8/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Good move- gets a piece out and prepares for king side castling.  But does White really want to put his King one the firing line of that half open g-file?  Good thing for him that queen-side castling is still an option but that will take more time as none of his queenside pieces have developed as of yet.  This is the type of concern that allows us to see the how important the time element of chess is and how important it is to get the pieces out and get the king into a safe haven.
44,1,9,a6,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p1np1p2/8/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',An aimless move.  Was black worried about the knight being pinned by the Bishop?  If he was worried about this his worries were groundless.  It would take another move by the white bishop to move to b5 which is a waste of time.  Also the knight does not defend anything so why would white want to pin it in the first place?  Black should have gotten another piece off the back rank - any undeveloped piece move would have been a good move.
45,1,10,O-O,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p1np1p2/8/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Good move but he needs to be wary about that open g-file.  white should definitely think about plans to transfer his c1 bishop over to the king side and place it on g3 so as to protect his king further from the g-file battery.  It's not a concern yet but it could be troubling later if Black chooses to operate there.
46,1,11,Ne5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p1p2/4n3/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black moves a developed piece twice while his other pieces sit back and watch.  Is he planning to win this war with one piece?
47,1,12,Nxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p1p2/4N3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',White captures the knight.  There are other options than this and considering that white's entire queenside is undeveloped this may not have been the best move.  For example 7. d3 would have protected the Bishop while opening the tomb of the c1 Bishop.  If white captures the c6 knight then Black can simply recapture with Queen thus developing that piece to an active position.  But perhaps White simply wanted to keep his light squared Bishop from being exchanged for the knight.
48,1,13,fxe5,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p4/4p3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',This is a pawn captured towards the center which is good but in this case capturing with the d pawn would have opened the scope of the Queen for Black.
49,1,14,d4,b'r1bqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/p2p4/4p3/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq d3',Great move!  Open the game up and get that other Bishop into play!
50,1,15,b5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/p2p4/1p2p3/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq b6',What???  Why?  
51,1,16,Bd5,b'r1bqkb1r/2p1pp1p/p2p4/1p1Bp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',Obvious.  Punish Black for causing a sickness within his own light color square complex and force him to make an awkward rook move.
52,1,17,Bd7,b'r2qkb1r/2pbpp1p/p2p4/1p1Bp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',Black needed to preserve his rook.  Because of this move he loses the exchange:  Rook minus Bishop equals two pawns.  This is decisive in most chess games.
53,1,18,1Qf3,b'r2qkb1r/2pbpp1p/p2p4/1p1Bp3/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq -',"White now not only reiterates his attack on the rook he also threatens the ""Achilles Heel"" - f7.  A strike by the queen at f7 in this position means checkmate."
54,1,19,1e6,b'r2qkb1r/2pb1p1p/p2pp3/1p1Bp3/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq -',Great move!  He saw the threat and parries the checkmate threat.

57,1,22,1Qc3,b'B2qkb1r/2pb1p1p/p3p3/1p1pp3/3P4/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b k -',Uh...maybe not.  Why didn't White move his bishop to b7 or at least capture the d5 pawn in self sacrifice?  
58,1,23,1Qc8,b'B1q1kb1r/2pb1p1p/p3p3/1p1pp3/3P4/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w k -',How many chances does Black need to see that the Bishop is right there?  That's three points!

White needs to consider harmonious development of his pieces and he needs to consider king position as an important factor in the game.  That is it may have been wiser for him to get the queenside pieces out and castle queenside.  A stronger player would have gone for a mating attack on the g-file.  Black needs to focus on the point value of the pieces and he needs focus on not making so many unnecessary pawn moves.  Try to get through each game without losing one pawn (or piece) and try to not move any pawn except for the d and e-pawns.  Also try to get in the habit of moving each piece only once in the first ten or twelve moves.  And make castling a priority!  If Black does these things he will begin improving immediately.

The opening was convenient because I was in the mood for a nice slow game.  Closed games like these tend to make mistakes and advantages in the game fairly subtle. 

White has several options available.  Evans Gambit (4. b4) and the Italian Gambit (4. d4) are aggressive options.  Guicco Pianissimo (4. d3) is a tender approach where both sides rely on middle-game creativity.  Main line (4. c3) prepares to control the center on d4."

No move is without its disadvantages though.  Finding those disadvantages is important to developing good strategy.
One disadvantage in this move is that it weakens a relatively clumsy white c3 pawn.  Initially pushed in order to support the d pawn's march to d4 the c-pawn now has to protect the b-pawn from the black knight while receiving little protection itself (presuming that white wants to develop the queenside knight)."

Pawn rushes like these must be treated carefully.

The difference between success and failure in pawn rushes is subtle."

Alternatively this could have been a good opportunity for white to take advantage of the knight's retreat.  16. d4 is now a feasible option that opens the game up a bit (notice white's queen is out of the game otherwise) and makes white's white-square bishop less bad."

Concerned about Bxe6 in the future I planned the possibility of redirecting my attention towards the power-struggle in the center should things go awry.

Looking back the move wasn't very wise.  It allows white another opportunity to temporarily distract black from his knight's plan by playing 17. d4."

The new threat against white is now the half-open file and most of white's pieces are cordoned off by an unfortunate pawn structure.

White's best move here is d4.  It takes away the defender of the now-overextended f-pawn and take away the initiative that could be used to manipulate the half-open g-file. "
85,2,15,2Qb1,b'r4rk1/bp1q1p2/p1pp1n1p/P3p2b/1P2Pp2/1BPP1N1P/3N1PP1/1Q2RRK1 b - -',"This is white's only concrete mistake.  The plan is to allow Bd1 to eliminate black's white-square bishop.  However this puts a majority of white's pieces on the back rank and gives the rooks even less room in an already tight position.  Furthermore there's nowhere that the knight on f3 can go except perhaps h2.

The mistake isn't game-breaking and it's certainly playable given what transpires in the next few moves (20. ... Kh8 21. Kh1 Rg8 22. Nh4 Rg5 23. Bd1) but there are better and more offensive moves available.

I find that the alternative of d4 is the best alternative move to make."

If Rg2 then Nf5.  This blocks black's queen from targeting the potential weakspot h3.

If Rg5 then Nf3 and white attacks the rook before being able to double.

If the rook moves anywhere else on the g-file it gets captured by either a knight or a pawn.

If black doesn't double the rooks on the g-file right away white will win an irreversibly strong outpost on f5 (effectively stealing black's original plan!)."

203,6,7,Nc6,b'r3k2r/ppq1bppp/1Pn1pn2/3p4/Q7/2P1PN2/3B1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq -',I missed that my queen was en prise and instead blocked with the knight so as to develop simultaneously.

This was not played to relieve pressure on the king per se but rather to let my king attack.  I figured that if David invested the time to get his queen deep in my backfield (as he had on occasion considered - at one point even playing Qc3 but withdrawing it a few moves later) I could safely run my King out for a moment and perhaps even regain material.
206,6,10,Rec8,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/Q3nB2/8/5PPP/1R3RK1 w - -',This board position was reached later in the evening.  David had made various probing attacks into my backfield with his queen and I had summoned up the confidence to tell him that my pieces were all guarded and that this was the problem with being up a queen but down in minor pieces.  I negelected to mention that 25. Ra1 ... 26. Qxa7 Rxa7 27. Rxa7 can force queening or that he could blow the exchange and still be ahead ignoring a few pawns.
207,6,11,2h3,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/Q3nB2/7P/5PP1/1R3RK1 b - -',I think David played this move to mirror my h6.  I don't believe that he saw a direction for this game to go with my defenses not budging and he may have played this to avoid a theoretical future back rank mate and stall until a draw was offerred.
208,6,12,2Nc3,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/Q4B2/2n4P/5PP1/1R3RK1 w - -',I however did see a direction which would give me much better chances than I had been staring at until moments before.
209,6,13,Ne2+,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/5B2/7P/4nPP1/QR3RK1 w - -',A decoy attack on the queen!  I do not plan to win the exchange and fall apart in a rapidly approaching endgame but rather win a bishop complements of the house.
210,6,14,2Kh2,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/5B2/7P/4nPPK/QR3R2 b - -',I would have recommended Kh1 but this is not bad until later moves make it so.

213,6,17,2Qc3,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/8/2Qn3P/5PPK/1R3R2 b - -',A solid move.  He is trying to force me to release his passed pawn and give up my knight and bishop for the cost of a rook on b4.
214,6,18,2Nxf2,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/8/2Q4P/5nPK/1R3R2 w - -',My only forward move.  If he accepts the exchange I can not fathom where the game would go but fortunately for me he plays conservatively.
215,6,19,3Qf4,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/2bp4/4nQ2/7P/6PK/1R3R2 b - -',?  He doesn't see what I saw on Move No. 28.

He has killed 13 points of material and attacked another rook king and two pawns on top of that.  He has attacked more than 3/4 of the squares on white's side of the board and now he secures white's passed pawn.  This ends the game and David's subsequent play shows it.
218,6,22,3Rf4,b'r1r3k1/p1P2pp1/1p2p2p/3p4/2n2R2/7P/6PK/2R5 b - -',Again the precise move orders may not be correct.  The board positions are however roughly correct.
219,6,23,Qf4#,b'6k1/1r3pp1/7p/4p3/2np1q2/6KP/6P1/8 w - -',This was a very fun game.  David is a good player and has some strong non-theoretical ideas which really gives me a run for my money in fast paced over-the-board play.  I probably won't play him much anymore since I know I can win from Queen over bishop odds but still - a very solid player and an excellent game.
220,7,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',I like playing against e4 I switch between the Sicilian and the petrov. I know your supposed to master 1 opening and keep with that but i like both. I have also recently found the philidor which i really like and will be playing more often. I should also say that i have only been back playing chess proper this year (april) so i am still looking for the openings that suit me best. I have found the website highlighted on marinvukusic profile www.chessgames.com very helpful.
221,7,1,Bc4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',The petrov Italian variation. Usual i have found is 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d5 d4. 6.Bd3....is more common so this was quite exciting! As a kid i always played this opening as white to try and fork the queen and rook (Ng5 Nxf7) :) you could only ever do it straight off against beginners though. Nostalgic moment there!
222,7,2,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pN3/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6',This threatens whites bishop whilst creating pressure around the centre of the board. I will now develop which should be carried out whilst gaining tempo thanks to whites retreat of the bishop (anticipated move).
223,7,3,Qe2,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pN3/2B1n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',(anticipated retreat of the bishop does not materialise) Had never played against this so it took me by surprise. now taking bishop leads to an exchange of minor pieces leaving white in a superior position therefore gaining tempo from whites retreat is no longer on.
224,7,4,Be6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3pN3/2B1n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',I think this is the best move. It prevents a discovered check if i move my e4 knight it strengthens the centre of the board and it is constructive development. 
225,7,5,d3,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3pN3/2B1n3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq -',Having to move the threatened knight or go for exchange. i don't like the exchange as afterwards white has control of the centre and would dictate the way i will play (dxc4 Qxe4 c6 white superior). moving knight gives me better defensive security and allows my development to continue at my pace and my say so.
226,7,6,Nf6,b'rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3pN3/2B5/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',knight retreats into position which i feel comfortable with while at same time leaves white to ponder the threat on the bishop. From here i should be able to develop with ease.
227,7,7,Bd6,b'rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/3pN3/8/1B1P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq -',Continuing development and putting pressure on e5 knight as it is cause for concern.
228,7,8,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/3pN3/8/1B1P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w - -',strengthens my defence and continues development. I could have played (8.... Nc6 9.... Nd7) however that i am sure would end up with myself doubling pawns which i am not a fan of.
229,7,9,c6,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbbn2/3pN1B1/8/1B1P4/PPP1QPPP/RN3RK1 w - -',c6 can be looked at as a strange move it blocks the knights usual route out of the back line however it stabilises my position within the centre of the board. (I am also anticipating f4.)
230,7,10,1f4,b'rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2pbbn2/3pN1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3RK1 b - f3',anticipated well. Now a intricate little battle is going on around my king side. white is perhaps hoping i play Nbd7 or Bxe5 which would lead to white probably winning the game. I have numerous moves which can prevent white gaining an advantage.
231,7,11,1Qb6+,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/3pN1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3RK1 w - -',However Qb6  is best. Knight is no longer pinned and now the e5 knight (which I think is key in whites attack) can be removed.
232,7,12,1Kh1,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/3pN1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - -',Qb6  allows black the option of how future play will work out around my king side and as previously stated i believe the removal of the e5 knight is now essential.
233,7,13,1Bxe5,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1bn2/3pb1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K w - -',gets rid of pesky knight and relieves pressure on the king side.
234,7,14,Nfd7,b'rn3rk1/pp1n1ppp/1qp1b3/3pP1B1/8/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K w - -',best place for knight as threatening light squared bishop will be next move which starts a interesting battle. 
235,7,15,1c3,b'rn3rk1/pp1n1ppp/1qp1b3/3pP1B1/8/1BPP4/PP2Q1PP/RN3R1K b - -',white seeing the threat to his bishop makes an escape route for him.
236,7,16,1Nc5,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1b3/2npP1B1/8/1BPP4/PP2Q1PP/RN3R1K w - -',This now kick starts the battle to which i refer in the first page of this annotation was the main thing to look out for.
237,7,17,1Bc2,b'rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1b3/2npP1B1/8/2PP4/PPB1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - -',a clever well thought out move had i falling for the trap or mistake?. it looks like a mistake and that is what i take it for as black still needs to make 1 more mistake before the queen is trapped. A mistake that can quite easily be played.

I see why he is doing it holding on to the prospect of taking queen for free but now i can free rook from bishops sights and save queen whilst going 4 points up!

2 important points in this match were:

 1. the intricate battle around the black king side which is successful for black because of the c6 pawn which allowed the check and black to dictate the pattern of play. 

2. the gamble white takes. clever as it was these moves should be made when you are certain of success or position as failure can result in a loss of both.

another point to be made is discipline. if black sees only material gain then he losses queen and probably match where as from that position being happy to gain the 2 point lead ultimately wins the match for black. 

I would be grateful for comments from the higher rated players to see there take on this match.

David."

For those who do not know what a samish system is it is the pawn structure extending from g2 to d4. The key feature is the pawn of f3 which ensures that the nature of the game progresses along quieter lines. 

This type of set up is ideal for this game because the black rooks remain locked behind a wall of pawns. "

365,12,52,2hxg3,b'4k3/3n1p2/7p/1R2p3/2b1P3/2R1B1P1/8/6K1 b - -',so here we  are  I put in conditional move after 28....  Bxb5.  29. Bxh6.  I don't know what he may do after that.  I am up a rook to a knight but his pawns are paired in the middle of the board.  so my advantage is minimal (if any)  I get 7.6 points for a draw against him but I sure would like ten more points and the pride of getting a win !!!! 
366,12,53,2Bxb5,b'4k3/3n1p2/7p/1b2p3/4P3/2R1B1P1/8/6K1 w - -',So he evens this up.
367,12,54,2Bxh6,b'4k3/3n1p2/7B/1b2p3/4P3/2R3P1/8/6K1 b - -',I get a pawn  
368,12,55,2Ke7,b'8/3nkp2/7B/1b2p3/4P3/2R3P1/8/6K1 w - -',he pushes king towards the middle

370,12,57,3Ke6,b'8/3n1p2/4k2B/1b2p3/4P3/2R3P1/6K1/8 w - -',he pushes his king to the middle some more  I understand that  
371,12,58,3g4,b'8/3n1p2/4k2B/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R5/6K1/8 b - -',i go ahead and keep pushing a pawn   (and hoping I figure out something or he makes a mistake ~ either case seems doubtful)
372,12,59,3f6,b'8/3n4/4kp1B/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R5/6K1/8 w - -',an obvious move..
373,12,60,3Kg3,b'8/3n4/4kp1B/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R3K1/8/8 b - -',I go ahead and support the pawn hoping at some point i have a little more flexibiity in where I can move what.  By keeping my king on a black square  he can't put me in check with his bishop at least.  maybe i can sneak around and get a pawn to the 8th rank  this is going to be a long drawn out process
374,12,61,3Kf7,b'8/3n1k2/5p1B/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R3K1/8/8 w - -',he just moves his king  Kind of like he wants to attack my bishop .  
375,12,62,3Be3,b'8/3n1k2/5p2/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R1B1K1/8/8 b - -',I don't see any real advantageous move so i just move the guy out of the way to save for a rainy day
376,12,63,3Ke6,b'8/3n4/4kp2/1b2p3/4P1P1/2R1B1K1/8/8 w - -',he looks like he is just wanting the middle of the board.  this game is looking more and more draw-ish

380,12,67,3Kf7,b'8/3n1k2/2R2p2/4p3/4P1P1/3bB1K1/8/8 w - -',i kiind of thought he might try to bait me by going to e7 (then Bc5  Nxb5Rxb5....  ) that would have given him my bishop for the knight...but ok.
381,12,68,3Kf3,b'8/3n1k2/2R2p2/4p3/4P1P1/3bBK2/8/8 b - -',I thought briefly about Rd6 but then if he gets the pawn at e4 sacrficing the knight  i have little opportunity to keep him from getting a pawn promoted. or if i do  I have to give up a piece and it is still a draw game (dammit)
382,12,69,3Bb5,b'8/3n1k2/2R2p2/1b2p3/4P1P1/4BK2/8/8 w - -',gee  he wants me to move my rook.  I have no idea where to put it so i decided just to pin the knight 
383,12,70,3Rc7,b'8/2Rn1k2/5p2/1b2p3/4P1P1/4BK2/8/8 b - -',so I pin the knight  I don't really have a plan and that concerns me
384,12,71,3Kg6,b'8/2Rn4/5pk1/1b2p3/4P1P1/4BK2/8/8 w - -',I sure wish i could get somewhere with this and wonder about Rb7 and Rc8
385,12,72,3Rc8,b'2R5/3n4/5pk1/1b2p3/4P1P1/4BK2/8/8 b - -',I decide on this because I am hoping i can somehow pry that stupid knight off of the support for the pawn at f6 ~  it seems to be impeding my progress (progress???!!!!)
386,12,73,3Kg7,b'2R5/3n2k1/5p2/1b2p3/4P1P1/4BK2/8/8 w - -',"so it appears he is more than willing to take the draw.  but I want a win !  I am scratching my head going  ""I am up against his knight and paired pawns against my rook and split pawns  There has to some what I can do something !!!!.  I see me pinning the knight again leading to a repetative move deal.  I look for something else  the problem seems to be he has additional strenght in that his bishop has more relative strength against my split pawns than mine has against his paired.  i push "
387,12,74,3g5,b'2R5/3n2k1/5p2/1b2p1P1/4P3/4BK2/8/8 b - -',I am swapping pawns to break up the pair hoping it will give me SOMETHING !
388,12,75,3fxg5,b'2R5/3n2k1/8/1b2p1p1/4P3/4BK2/8/8 w - -',"he sees that he HAS to swap but states in comments: ""Just one more teensy wincy pawn and the draw is mine i can't believe i'm actually having to play for a draw...""  almost like I am supposed to get some sort of satisfaction out of getting  draw from him.  DAMMIT I WANT A WIN!"
389,12,76,4Bxg5,b'2R5/3n2k1/8/1b2p1B1/4P3/5K2/8/8 b - -',OK so now I have broken his pawns up (at a cost ~  I think a worthy cost) and start work on getting his pawn out of my way (or at least working a rook to knight end game that maybe I can win)
390,12,77,4Kf7,b'2R5/3n1k2/8/1b2p1B1/4P3/5K2/8/8 w - -',I don't see much..  still  If i go Kg4 then he can put me in check with the knight.  fat lotta good Kg4 does me .....
391,12,78,4Rc7,b'8/2Rn1k2/8/1b2p1B1/4P3/5K2/8/8 b - -',I go back to pinning the knight I want to get my king around or my bishop behind that stupid pawn.   Really it is a stall so I can think...  he doesn't have to know that though
392,12,79,4Ke6,b'8/2Rn4/4k3/1b2p1B1/4P3/5K2/8/8 w - -',he gets out of that and supports his pawn
393,12,80,4Bd2,b'8/2Rn4/4k3/1b2p3/4P3/5K2/3B4/8 b - -',"at this point  the back door may be an idle threat  so I figure give him a threat that I will com from a long range attack ...  ( actually I am just frustrated that I can't do anything about this and still have no real plan  hopefully he will mess up and let me get two pieces (my rook to e8 bishop c3 and  my kingf 5...  doubtful...but its all I have
I add a ridiculous comment for him  ""I see mate at move 73 how about you?"""
394,12,81,4Bd3,b'8/2Rn4/4k3/4p3/4P3/3b1K2/3B4/8 w - -',so he attacks my pawn and i guess a little check wouldn't hurt

This is an English Opening (1.c4) and can turn into independent lines only found in the English or can transpose into one of many different types of KID. If you play 1.c4 your opponent can play 1...c5 and in fact there is a ""Symmetrical English"" mainline that goes for about 10 moves with Black exactly copying White.
Here if you play 3.e4 then I pretty much have to play 3...d6 (to prevent 4.e5) so this will commit me to some sort of KID setup. If you instead play the ""normal"" 3.d4 then I have another option in 4...d5 the Grunfeld Defense which is extremely tactical. Playing 3.Nf3 keeps options open for both sides but also limits your choice of attacks against a possible KID setup (for instance the Averback Attack would not then be possible for you but plenty of other stuff would be). After this 3.Nf3 Black could then choose all sorts of other stuff based on 4...c5 (a Benoni or a delayed Benko Gambit for instance. I think Grandmasters like Reti and recent Soviet champion Gulko used to play stuff like 3.b3 here too but I don't know much theory."

I'm weighing d4 versus Ng3. d4 feels good in that I can gain control over more of the center and in response to the impending e4 I have the flexibility of either guarding or pushing d5 to make it difficult for you to develop you queen knight. Also it opens up my bishop file which can lay the groundwork for an attempted exchange with your king-side bishop. I would be a little concerned about defending all those pawns but not unduly so. Ng3 has the advantage that I can castle sooner but I don't feel any pressure at all to castle yet so I think it can wait. I'm not sure if there are other moves I should consider or lines that I should be looking further down."

It further delays development though and it blocks the c-h diagonal ruling out a near-term Bh6 so I'm going to stick with this simple development. Actually I thought we were ""out of the opening"" but I just consulted the MCO and it looks like this is the standard line which runs very very deep..."

By the way THIS is the absolutely critical stage where both players decide on their strategy for the next many moves. Don't just play any old move at this point. You have committed to Qside expansion with the great move b2-b4 and there are many ways to continue just try to form the long term plan for your piece placement now.
I recall that Walter Korn in MCO13 didn't like my move Ne8 here but I disagree. It has been played by Kasparov and it has many good points; the fact that it doesn't inhibit the c4-c5 advance (like it would on d7) is a weakness but White can force c4-c5 in any case so I'm not concerned about that.
One setup for White is Be3 Ne1 f3 Nd3 and c5. Another involves Ba3 Qb3 c5 and Nb5. Another is to play on the Kside after f7-f5 by Ng5 and if f5-f4 then Bg4. There are many more as well.

[DK]
Okay. Let's start looking for tiny chinks in your armor. Your rook on f8 is terribly immobile. Possibly I could exert pressure on it through the a3-h8 diagonal if I could depose your d6 pawn. Your queenside pawns are a little backward if I could gain control of the b file and again depose your d6 pawn placing a pawn on c5 with R on b1 then I could constrict your queenside development (forcing B to guard b7). Your knights are backward. I do not know how to take advantage of this. A pawn on c4 would block all movement for your e7 knight but not worth exposing my king..."

That reasoning all sounds good. I'm playing a safe move to keep the N (or B) out of g5 because my plan for playing f7-f5 is messed up by 10...f5 11.Ng5 f4 12.Ne6 BxN 13.dxe Rf6 14.c5 etc. My move ...h6 is very slow and gives you the initiative on the Qside but it is the safest way to continue a clear plan without making the tactics too muddy. Comming up: Kh8 (getting the K off the White Q's curent diagonal) f7->f5->f4 Rg8 g6->g5->g4 Ne8->f6->h5 Ne7->g6->h4....attack!!!...um if you don't kill me on the ignored Q-side first :)"

I've convinced myself that the crux of my attack must be against d6. If I can unlodge d6 and remount an attack against the center (e5) before your pawns come raining down then I feel I might have a chance. It feels like a race that is critically hinged on timing. I was looking for moves that might hinder your attack but the best defense I can come up with is a quick counterattack. If I can force you to make defensive moves then your attack will necessarily be slowed."

I like the moves you are making. Your thinking corresponds to how I understand White's strategy in the KID. the things that are different that I see here are this: Normally White's K knight moves immediately to allow for f2-f3 strengthening the center. I came very close to switching tactics here and taking in the center but I want to prepare a little bit more for it. With Rf7 I can close the center (f5-f4) or open it (f5xe4) I block the diagonal between K and Q and I prepare to play the B to f8 where it will eventually help protect d6.
----------------------
Ok so after your Bishop move I decided to take in the center for various reasons: 1) Because you left the Knight on f3 and didn't try to support the center with f2-f3 my ""normal"" KID attack of f5-f4 then a pawn storm doesn't really work. 2) Again due to not moving the Knight from f3 yu have built up a very strong initiative on the Q-side and if I just go about ""business as usual"" then I am surely going to be behind when the attacks start to show their teeth. Lastly quiet development by me could have tactical problems (ie 13...Bf8? 14. Nxe! dxe 15.d6  -).

[DK]
That was unexpected. I was planning something along the lines of 13. .. f4 Nc5 _ Nxc QxN cxd Qxd b5 Qf6 d6 Nxd Bxd Qxd Bxf  although I'm not entirely sure it's sound (not sure if I could have forced regaining material after sac'ing my knight)"

I considered that you may have also played Bb2 in which case I needed to retreat the N. I am not working up much counterplay and I'm afraid that I'll quickly be in a worse position unless I can activate my pieces better than this. My 13...fxe was probably a poor move as now my structure isn't coordinating very well with my pieces. If your pawn was still on e5 and mine had gone f5->f4 then I would have a much better handle on what's happening here.
466,20,9,1Nb3,b'r1bqn1k1/ppp2rb1/3p2pp/2PPp3/1PBnN3/BN3P2/P5PP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',[DK] Deferring opening up Qside with cxd. That threat is not going away and the tide of the game is returning to central control (e.g. the long black diagonal). Tactically if dxN I will fight for the pawn and threaten your bishop with Bb2. I think I'm okay with a knight exchange followed by fxN. If you do it immediately then Ne6 _ fxe loses the knight? With no black pawn to block the e file I can advance and with say Bd3 and Qc2 threaten g5 (which looks hard to defend). Does that seem reasonable?
467,20,10,axb4,b'r1b5/1pp3k1/3p2pp/2PP4/1pB1P3/4R3/P5PP/6K1 w - -',"[TR]
I think the exchanges were probably best under the circumstances--for both of us. This is the position I was playing for when I played the Q check feeling that I was in a worse ending that I may be able to hold to a draw. You have every right to play for a win you will very likely come out with a healthy pawn and my compensation will not be much--I expect to have either a very active rook or a more active King and do my best to draw based on this activity. ------------ You played before I could finish and post my comment above. Looks like I may get the active R. If you had played something like 27.cxd cxd 28.b5 then I was planning 28...Kf6 29.Rxe Ke5 holding the R to guard your e pawn and threatening Kd4 with a double attack on both your pieces. This activity was what I was banking on although it isn't much. Now I hope that my pieces will be able to take up reasonable positions and help me to hold the draw but I am still not out of the woods."
468,20,11,Rc6,b'2b5/1p6/1RrP2p1/5k1p/8/1B5P/P5P1/6K1 w - -',"[TR] They're all good things to be considering. On my end of course I am searching for possibilities to draw. These kinds of positions where Grandmasters either resign because they can see it's clearly lost or they agree to a draw because they see it is clearly drawn. Guys like us duke it out just trying to find our way through the minefield of blunders.
Here are some things I know about this type of position: 1) If I can trade all the pawns off the board one for one then I can sac my B for your last remaining ""extra"" pawn because R B vs R is a theoretical draw (unless my King position is exceptionally bad). 2) The ""same-colored"" Bishops make it harder for me to draw than ""opposite-colored Bishops"" would. 3) There are strange material-down endings that I can shoot for in some variations that are theoretical draws....one of these is trading everything off the board except for the 2 Rooks and your a and h pawns as long as they aren't very advanced I can supposedly hold the draw 2 pawns down.
---------------------------->;I wrote all of that while you were playing 36.d6. This is definitely the move that was coming....I just didn't know when it would come. If you have calculated out a way to push the pawn through then clearly it is the right move. If not then it is a very committing move as now the B cannot defend it anymore on a Black square. I expected Kh2 or Kf2 to be consistent with your h3 move. In one line it makes a big difference: 37.Rb5  Kf6 38.Rd5 Bd7 39.Ba4? at first looks very strong except for now 39...Rc1  (because the K is still ""checkable"") 40.Kf2 BxB 41.d2 Bxd2 42.RxB and pawns are now equal."
469,20,12,3Rb5+,b'2b5/1p6/2rP2p1/1R3k1p/8/1B5P/P5P1/6K1 b - -',[DK] Yes I was originally going to h3 to avoid exactly the line you pointed out 39. Ba4? Rc1  40 Kh2 BxB! but this I believe can be avoided better by 39. Rd1 ... Also moving to h3 opens up possibilities for getting stalemated on h3 or even checkmated on the h file. Furthermore barring those dark thoughts it doesn't protect my king as much as I had thought since your pawns can exchange and blow my pawn cover (I think).

Blacks king can't go outside the square formed by b4-b8-f4-f8 (also known as ""the square of the pawn"") as this would allow the pawn on b4 to queen. And the Black king can't touch the ""little fortress"" the bishop and the pawns have built. The White king  can force the trade of knight and bishop on d3*. Then he can pick up the passed d-pawn**. Afterwards he can calmly walk over and win the remaining kingside pawns as the b- and c-pawns protect themselves. (If Black takes the c-pawn the b-pawn is unstoppable.)

* At some point Black has to trade knight for bishop with ...e4 and ...Nd3 Bxd3 dxe3 otherwise White will get the knight for free with help of the king.

(If you want you can use http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=8409329 to play out the moves quoted below.)
** The play I envisioned was 46...e4 47. Kg2 (moving to get inside the square of the soon passed d-pawn) 47...Nd3 48. Bxd3 exd3 49. Kf1 (White king is now inside the square) 49...Kd6 50. c4 (stopping the black king and winning). If Black plays 50...Ke5 White plays 51. b5 shrinking the square of the pawn preventing the Black king from safeguarding the passed d-pawn.

984,34,1,g3,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',Black has kept his part of the deal by adopting a King's Indian setup and here white could transpose directly to the King's Indian with 4. d4. Instead white insists on pushing for an English opening... something he will soon come to regret. 
985,34,2,Nge2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',This move reveals white's intentions. White could have (and maybe should have!) transposed to a King's Indian with 6. d4 but instead he is planning to play the Botvinnik system of the English opening which involves developing this knight to e2 and then play d3. 
986,34,3,c5,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6',Best. The Botvinnik system is intended to face a King's Indian setup where black instead plays 6...e5 and white can obtain very good results with it. Instead the move chosen by black gives white a much tougher time . Black clearly had access to a good database!
987,34,4,d3,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP2P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',And here we have it the Botvinnik system. On a first impression it seems that white has been smoking something he shouldn't have. He has locked up his g2 bishop behind his own pawns has developed his King's knight to a less forceful position than f3 and now on top of that he has made a horrible hole in d4 for his opponent to exploit. But there's method to this madness. The idea of the Botvinnik setup is that in exchange for all this the center is now completely locked. Since black cannot hit back in the center with this setup white intends to begin simultaneous offensives in the two flanks.  His plan is that he will be able to get to the black king and/or penetrate the queenside before black can take advantage of white's weaknesses. Against unprepared opposition this plan very often gives excellent results. My opponent however was not in this category...
988,34,5,h3,b'r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP2PP/PP2NPB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',A move worth playing in the Botvinnik setup since the pin that comes with Bg4 will distract white from his intended goals. 
989,34,6,Nd7,b'1rbq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/P1P1P3/2NP2PP/1P2NPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',All the previous moves are book moves; white makes the final preparations for the flank offensives while black decides he will first counter-strike in the queenside. The battle on all fronts has begun!
990,34,7,1Kh1,b'1rbq1rk1/1p1nppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/P1P1P3/2NP2PP/1P2NPB1/R1BQ1R1K b - -',One more move in preparation for what's to come. Alternatively white can begin the offensive in the Queenside with 11. Rb1 Nd4 12. b4 cxb4 13. Rxb4; instead 11. Kh1 anticipates that white will be playing f4 very soon. This is an important move because once white plays f4 and the battle is in full swing disaster will often result if white's king is caught with his pants down with a check along the g1-a7 diagonal.
991,34,8,1f5,b'1rbq1rk1/1p1np1bp/p1np2p1/2p2p2/P1P1P3/2NP2PP/1P2NPB1/R1BQ1R1K w - f6',And here black decides to innovate with what I consider an excellent move. The correct plan when playing against the Botvinnik setup is to fight fire with fire that is to begin offensives in both flanks. The alternative is to delay the kingside offensive for a bit with 11... Nd4 12. f4 e6 13. Rb1 f5. I must admit I was already beging to feel uneasy at this point... 
992,34,9,1Be3,b'1rbq1rk1/1p2p1bp/pnnp2p1/2p5/P1P1PP2/2N1B1PP/1P2N1B1/R2Q1R1K b - -',Black cannot play 14... Nxc4?? because of 15. Qd5  winning the knight. However on a hindsight it would probably have been better to play 14. b3 with the intention of developing the dark-squared bishop via b2 and not leaving the a1-h8 diagonal under control of black's dark squared bishop. As we will soon see in the following moves black's bishop becomes a formidable weapon on account of its unchallenged control of this diagonal. 
993,34,10,1Rc1,b'1r1q1r1k/1p2p1bp/pnnpb1p1/2p5/P1P1PP2/1PN1B1PP/4N1B1/2RQ1R1K b - -',Already white is beginning to regret his decision in move 14. Black's dark-squared bishop has started to put enormous pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal and white decides he better get his rook out of the bishop's scope as soon as possible. This is no small thing. With this move he not only gives up on a potential queenside offensive: now that the rook has left a1 black will begin a queenside offensive himself!
994,34,11,1Nd7,b'1r1q1r1k/1p1np1bp/p1npb1p1/2p5/P1P1PP2/1PN1B1PP/4N1B1/2RQ1R1K w - -',Excellent move: black wastes no time and prepares to take over the queenside with b5. My sense is that at the very least black has now fully equalized.  
995,34,12,1Rb1,b'1r1q1r1k/3np1bp/2npb1p1/1ppN4/2P1PP2/1P2B1PP/4N1B1/1R1Q1R1K b - -',After 15. cxb5? Rxb5 white's b3 pawn would become a permanent target for black's rooks. White has become aware that black is about to seize the initiative in the queenside and deploys his rook to prevent invasion via the b-file. Still black will now create a weak pawn for him in c4 that will be under serious pressure from his light-squared bishop in e6.
996,34,13,Nb4,b'1r1q1r1k/3np1bp/3pb1p1/2pN4/1nP1PP2/4B1PP/4N1B1/1R1Q1R1K w - -',Black's position is already superb at this point. From here on he can just take his time and prepare to double his major pieces on the b or a files; white can do nothing to prevent this since black's dark-squared bishop controls the a1 and b2 squares that white would need to occupy with his rook in order to prevent an eventual invasion of his queenside.
997,34,14,2g4,b'1r1q1r1k/3np1bp/3pb1p1/2pN4/1nP1PPP1/4B2P/4N1B1/1R1Q1R1K b - -',Mostly just a bluff; white threatens 21. f5 but this threat can easily be taken care of with 21... Bg8 which is what black plays. After 21... Bg8 white can't really advance his f-pawn any further because doing so will provide black's d7 knight with a perfect outpost in e5.
998,34,15,Qa5,b'1r3rbk/3np1bp/3p2p1/q1pN4/1nP1PPP1/4B2P/3QN1B1/1R3R1K w - -',An excellent move with which black starts to take complete control of the queenside; white can't play 23. Nxe7 since his position will simply collapse after 23... Bxc4 with both black bishops now having full scope on the queenside. Black's position is phenomenal. I submitted this game to post-mortem analysis in Fritz 10 and it considered that black had made the very best moves since move 12!
999,34,16,2Rfc1,b'1r3rbk/3np1bp/3p2p1/q1pN4/1nP1PPP1/4B2P/3QN1B1/1RR4K b - -',With this move white gives up on a possible kingside attack but there's little else to recommend since white will simply be demolished if black ever gets to play Bxc4. 
1000,34,17,2Rf7,b'1r4bk/3nprbp/3p2p1/q1pN4/1nP1PPP1/4B2P/3QN1B1/1RR4K w - -',And just when black is in complete control of the game a terrible blunder. With this move black's light-squared bishop (which was exerting enormous indirect pressure on white's weak c-pawn) is suddenly left out of the game and on top of that black's rooks are suddenly left disconnected. Fritz recommends 23... Nb6!. White of course cannot then play 24. Nxe7? since he will not survive after 24... Bxc4!. But even more so he cannot play 24. Nxb4? either since 24...Nxc4! 25. Qd3 Rxb4 will simply kill him because of the massive onslaught in the queenside. White thus would have no choice other than 24. Bf1 which reduces him to critical passivity. It's almost unfair that after the text move black's excellent position simply collapses. 
1001,34,18,2Nec3,b'1r4bk/3nprbp/3p2p1/q1pN4/1nP1PPP1/2N1B2P/3Q2B1/1RR4K b - -',Fritz noted that here I missed a much stronger option 24. Nxb4! Rxb4 25. e5 where the threat of 26. e6 forces black to lose material.

Maybe black was expecting white to play 25. exd5?? putting and end to the vulnerability of his c4 pawn and winning both more space and a strong control of the crucial e6 square but white would then lose a piece after 25... Bxc3 26. Qxc3 Qxc3 27. Rxc3 Rxb1 (or even 25... Rxb1 26. Rxb1 Bxc3). Once again all this is due to the fact that black's dark-squared bishop is stronger in this position than any other piece except the queen! But after 25. Nxd5 black's once overwheliming pressure is suddenly entirely dispelled since he is forced to change his active major pieces.
1003,34,20,Rxb1,b'6bk/3nprbp/3p2p1/2pN4/2P1PPP1/7P/3B2B1/1rR4K w - -',White will now be in control of the b-file (which black has controlled throughout the game) but there was nothing black could do to prevent this since 26...Rf8? 29. Nxe7 or 26... Bf6 27. Rxb8 Nxb8 28. Rb1. The disastrous consequences of disconnecting his rooks with 23. Rf7? can be plainly seen at this point where the tables have turned completely and white is now in control of the queen-side. 
1004,34,21,Bf6,b'6bk/3npr1p/3p1bp1/2pN4/2P1PPP1/7P/3B2B1/1R5K w - -',Black's position is miserable with all his pieces suddenly pushed against the edge of the board and having to wait for white to invade with Rb7. In anticipation of 28. Rb7 and the pressure the white rook will exert against his e7 pawn black gets his bishop out of the jam into a position where it can support this pawn and at the same time tempts white to relieve the pressure in exchange for the bishop pair with 28. Nxf6(?). But 27... Bf6? is a serious mistake as it allows white to win material in an already critical position. Fritz recommends 27... h6 but I actually think that 27... e5 clearing the e-pawn from its vulnerable square and giving black some space to breath was much better.
1005,34,22,e6,b'6bk/1R1n1r1p/3ppbp1/2pN4/2P1PPP1/7P/3B2B1/7K w - -',Black fails to see that the primary target of 28. Rb7 is not really the e-pawn. The only alternative was 28... Nf8 although after 29. g5 Bd4 30. Nxe7 Rg7 31. Rc7 black would be fighting an uphill battle for a draw. Now with the text move white wins a piece. 
1006,34,23,3Bc3,b'7k/5b1p/3ppnp1/2p5/2P1PPP1/2B4P/6B1/7K b - -',This is how black loses a piece; if 31... Kg7 then 32. g5 or if 31... e5 then 32. fxe5 Ne8 33. e6  winning black's bishop with the discovered check. It is a cruel irony indeed that black had complete control of the a1-h8 diagonal throughout all of the game but loses as soon as white takes over it. Black resigns.

Bc5 is a move that caused me trouble in some games (or better: my bad aswer caused the trouble). It covers the squares e3 and f2 that can be attacked once more by Ng4. 
Nbd2 is still critical in my opinion there are still 112 games using this move though. 47 games won by white. In the games won by black e4 becomes frequent after Nbd2. It is then often played after black's kingside castling."

My opinion is still that the squares e3 and f2 are weak in the white camp. Please note that neither d4 nor Nb3 are possible here because white will stay one piece behind (for a pawn) after the exchanges."

(brulla) We have now reached a heavily tactical position. Characteristic for me is that

Ne2 - I did not anticipate this move in my conditional moves/analyse board set up - OMG the knight is going to manoeuvre itself to h5 after the rook moves to f3 winning the weak f6 pawn.  Here I decide to take a gamble.  For piece activity on the g file I sacrifice a couple of pawns.  The idea is that after the major pieces have been exchanged and perhaps the minor pieces too - I may be able to afford to go into a king and pawn ending one or two pawns down because his extra pawns are on the h file and not too far away from my king and his own king would have to make a journey to the pawns.  To ensure this would happen I decided to ensure that my remaining f pawn was backed up by my rook and would attack the hind h pawn with my bishop winning it back.  The foremost h pawn would be used as a screen against the black king on the h file and be picked off by the king later on - unfortunately because of a series of zwizchensugs (in between moves) Marin has other ideas.

What I am now going to do is to play more unrated games in the 1600s to 1800s bracket and try and work my way up.  Hopefully if I can get some good results against these I can have another stab at challenging an Expert (other than a training game) and give him or her a much tougher assignment - possibly reach that elusive utopia of half point or dare I hope more!

1055,38,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',This is an online 1-minute match I played with my coach. He normally crushes me in online blitz games or he'll flag me when I'm winning but today I got the satisfaction of crushing him brilliantly using only 11 seconds of my time.
1056,38,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',Pre-move I often pre-move c5 on the first move but it is risky in case White plays b4 first move but I knew my coach wouldn't do that so I just pre-moved c5.
1057,38,2,f4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',The opening moves were played very rapidly I'm not even sure if either of us had used a second yet. This is the Grand Prix Attack where White goes for a bunch of cheap attacks on the kingside which can be dangerous against an unprepared player. I do not recommend playing Grand Prix against a player with book knowledge.
1058,38,3,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq -',This blocks the diagonal and prepares for a future d5-boost but I didn't need to spend a second on this move this is still book and blocking the bishop's diagonal is a logical move.

I didn't really want to go into complications in a 1-minute match so I just played Nge7 almost instantly. In bullet games you shouldn't go into complications when you're the one getting attacked it makes you think more so that your opponent has a better chance of flagging you even if you're winning. I'll just make very quick solid moves.

Playing bullet chess can often screw up your chess and make you play bad in long time control games but it can also improve your instincts and ability to think quick and move fast. But don't get addicted to 1-minute chess............. one time on a night before a tournament I played over 100 bullet games in a row and did very badly in the tournament because I made so many quick ""unthoughtout"" moves."

Nd4 is a typical move in Grand Prix lines since the knight on c3 prevents a pawn from chasing away the knight and Nxd4 lets me have better control of the centre even though I have doubled isolated pawns they are not an issue

Bf5 here is a tricky way to defend my f-file assault but it takes away defense from the knight which would allow a rook to come to the e-file to double-attack the knight that is stopping Bd4 "

Just don't get addicted!
1076,39,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',This game shows how I crushed a master who didn't take me very seriously he overextended his position and totally neglected his king safety. He was probably  having a bad tournament because I have never seen a master lose like this before.
