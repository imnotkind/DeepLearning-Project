White should play e4 instead of the text move to shut down the a8-h1 diagonal. The LSB will be a real nuisance and White misses his chance to limit the Bishop.
I chose e3 instead mainly because after e4 the queenside Knight would have to be developed to d2 also shutting off the DSB. c5 is a common move from Black in the closed games and should it happen that Black takes the d-pawn I prefer to take back with a pawn instead of the Knight even if the pawn becomes isolated. While White's DSB should be developed to the Kingside before shutting him off I have experienced that the DSB will either regain it's mobility after a pawn exchange in the centre or can support a Queenside advance if the centre stays fixed. It probably is a consequence of my d-pawn preference. "
56,2,1,e6,b'rn1qkbnr/1bpp1ppp/p3p3/1p6/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',A natural move. It supports c5 if Black wants to attack the centre and the DSB has several options.

Black doesn't seem to care about defending that pawn and white will have more trouble to take care of a pawn on b4 keeping in mind that due to the supported Rook on a8 a5 and c5 are possible. White will have to take the pawn to get the Knight to c3 which is needed there to have a look over the squares d5 and e4 consequence of 3. e3.
- The text move delays the exchange. If Black pushes the pawn now White can get rid of it with 5. ...b4 6.a3 a5 7.ab ab 8. Rxa8 Bxa8 9.Qa4. Now Bc6 will be met with 10. Qb3 (followed by 11. c5 if necessary)"

59,2,4,Bd3,b'rn1qk1nr/1bppb1pp/p3p3/1P3p2/3P4/3BPN2/PP1B1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq -',White will have to snatch that pawn to sooner or later but the later the better. The pawn on b5 serves two purposes; preventing not only c5 but the queenside Knight cannot develop until that pawn disappears. Black's d-pawn won't move otherwise e6 will get weak and allows counterplay especially after Black castles. While c4 is a better square for White's LSB 7. ...ab forces the retake immediatly. The text move is a bit more flexible as it allows White to just give back the pawn and block it with b4.
60,2,5,O-O,b'rn1q1rk1/1bppb1pp/p3pn2/1P3p2/3P4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',I thought about keeping the King in the centre as Black obviously will soon be attacking the Kingside. Castling long is not an option due to the (soon open) a-file. White has the option to push the Kingside pawns with the rooks behind them while the Bishops provide support and protect the King from attacks from the Queenside. Unfortunately it will take too long to manouvre the Rooks into proper positions and f3 and f2 will be very vulnerable. 
61,2,6,Nc6,b'r2q1rk1/1bppb1pp/2n1pn2/1B3p2/3P4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',After the development of both sides is finished White has to make a crucial decision. White is up a pawn in material but Black's pieces are superior positioned. The LSB is a nuisence from the beginning. The DSB will show itself on d6 very soon and with both Bishops aiming at the King's pawns windmill and mating themes spring to mind automatically. White's main goal must be to exchange one of the Bishops before Black's attack gets underway preferrably the LSB. Right now there is no line for White to achieve that goal though. White also has to put his DSB to use. On the positive White has an eye on e5 to use as an outpost and the promise of pushing the queenside pawns.
62,2,7,1Na4,b'r2q1rk1/1bppb1pp/2n1pn2/1B3p2/N2P4/4PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',Maybe a more passive defense was needed but since I can't force the exchange of a Bishop I am aiming to exchange Black's Kingside Knight to prevent it from joining the Kingside attack. White will give the central d-pawn to activate the DSB via c3. The central pawn isn't that valuable since -as has been said Black's d-pawn will stay put and by opening the d-file Black's c-pawn will stay to support the DSB to allow the Black Queen to roam around.

65,2,10,Bd6,b'r2q1rk1/1bpp2pp/2nbp3/1B3p2/8/P1B1PN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - -',So far by giving back the pawn White has activated his DSB and the Queen. Black still has the superior position but White's options have slightly improved - slightly. White has cleared the path to either trying to defend the Kingside by retreating the LSB and pushing the pawns on the queenside or to get rid of the remaining Knight and use e5 to actively defend.
66,2,11,1Bxc6,b'r2q1rk1/1bpp2pp/2Bbp3/5p2/8/P1B1PN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - -',"I chose to defend the latter way. Freddy later remarked that it seems that I preferred active defense over passive defense but I am not one that thinks ""active defense or get off my lawn"". The art of defense includes passive defense and I don't shy away from it if I think I can hold it. While it seems inferior to exchange the Bishop for the Knight it has its values for White. The LSB can't play against e6 as long as the pawn on d7 is there. It also can't switch to the Kingside while the black Knight can. If the Knight appears on g6 the white Knight is again denied from e5. The main point of the exchange is to occupy e5 and block the b8-h2 diagonal. As long as the DSB stays on e6 the white Knight is a good compensation. Black has to move the LSB after the exchange which gives White the needed tempo to prevent Qg5.

Freddy suggested 16. a4 after I had moved. Back then I didn't see the point - just later I found that it was helping in keeping out the rook from a4."
67,2,12,1Qh5,b'r2q1rk1/2pp2pp/3bp3/3bNp1Q/8/P1B1P3/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - -',This is what I imagined as defending position. The Black LSB is a powerhouse but one diagonal is closed. At this point I was aiming at sacrificing a rook for the LSB hopefully destroying the pawn chain. If White manages to exchange the Queens the DSB and the Knight will give White chances to hold out. If Black gives the DSB for the Knight White's position also improves.

No doubt you have heard of the race being on when both sides castle on opposite sides.  This usually happens in the Sicilian Dragon.  This was the Robatsch Defense but the set up was very similar to the Dragon.  Both of us were at each other's throats in this game and it looked as though I was gonna lose especially when I lost a piece for a pawn and then gave up a rook for Steve's dsb (leaving me a rook for 2 pawns to the bad) to get a perpetual check or if my opponent slipped up a snap mate.  So this was the knife-edge.  How did it all end?  Well folks read on.  I have got the gameknot analysis form of the game here for you to refer to when necessary.    http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13908054&rnd=0.14359211126206422"
88,4,1,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',1. ... g6 - this move is the Robatsch Defense.  Steve's dsb will go to g7 and may become a monster - for a starters he is bearing down on my rook on a1 when he gets there!
89,4,2,f4,b'rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq f3',4. f4 - a kind of Pseudo-Austrian Attack.

With the black heavies bearing down upon Henry my outlook will be very bleak indeed.  Steve told me that Qxd4 would have made his life much easier - I am glad I played Qxg6+ and made Steve run the gauntlet from Glenda then.

The last time I sacrificed any material was in a game against The Master Mater of all people annotated as Don't Play for Cheapos - needless to say I lost.  Steve told me that he did not expect this move at all.  This move completely opens up the BK to Glenda and my other rook and possibly my knight on g3 so I thought that I might at least save the game and if Steve erred even win it!
109,4,22,Kg8,b'rr4k1/2q5/5Q2/p2p4/2n5/6N1/PP2R1PP/1K6 w - -',32. ..... Kg8 - Steve told me in the chat that he thought he had made a blunder.  I did not comment at this stage but I thought that Steve's next move 33. ..... Qg7 was an innacuracy and that 33. ...... Kh8 was better because if I checked him on the h column then the Wicked Witch of the West would give Henry a cross-check on h7.  I anticipated that before I played 32. Qg5+ because my next move would have been to have put Henry on a1 away from any checks from Steve's pieces and hopefully be able to resume checking the BK.

111,4,24,Kh8,b'rr5k/5q2/8/p5Q1/2n5/6N1/PP2R1PP/1K6 w - -',35. ...... Kh8 - now he plays Kh8 but I can now play my rook to e7 because the Wicked Witch is off the c or d column.  If I had played this move on move 33 then Re7 would not have worked because of 34. Na3+ followed by Ka1 followed by Qc1#.  No back row mate is possible here because my knight on g3 controls the f1 square.  Now the BQ is pinned to a mate on g7.
112,4,25,3Ka1,b'rr5k/4Rq2/8/p5Q1/8/n5N1/PP4PP/K7 b - -',37. Ka1 - this move is best because I analysed a forced mate for Steve should Henry have gone to c1 starting with 38. Rc8+.  Steve played Nc2+ and offered me a draw (now ironically it was Steve needing a perpetual to save HIS game) which I accepted.  Pheeeeeeeew!

177,6,10,1Qe2,b'rn2kbnr/p2ppp1p/4q1p1/8/8/2B5/PP2QPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq -',Be2 was better as it keeps queens on board and with two bishops in open position white has more than enough compensation for the pawn. 
178,6,11,f6,b'rn2kbnr/p2pp2p/5pp1/8/8/2B5/PP2BPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq -',Notable mistake. I thought that with pawn on f6 I can advance the central pawns. Clearly it is not so simple. Nf6 was better as it develops the knight and if white takes the knight he loses bishop pair.
179,6,12,Kf7,b'r4bnr/p2ppk1p/2n2pp1/8/8/2B2N2/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 w - -',Serious blunder. e5 was correct. Now the d7 pawn is not protected and f6 is pinned.

White trades his very active knight for not developed yet bishop. Bishop completely blocked by it;s own pawns. Bishop that blocks development of the rook on h8. While not the most significant mistake in terms of score change this Nxf6? move is probably the one which players of every level can learn from.

This game demonstrates the importance of blunders in games between club-level players.

237,8,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Hi everyone!

It is the same old story - with quite a few of my expert games and even some of my master games I manage to get to 30 odd moves and am doing alright and then bang summat goes wrong and I lose.  This is a classic example.  Before this game which is a Sicilian Antagonistknight my opponent warned me that going on the defensive against the Master Mater was not a good idea but what does Jo do she gives Antagonistknight a classic example of defensive play right on a plate!  As before here is the Gameknot Analysis link to this game:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13852792&rnd=0.8263391849920074 -I may refer to it in my commentary now on with the game."
238,8,1,c4,b'r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq c3',5. c4 - something a little unusual here.

243,8,6,1b3,b'2rq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/8/2P1P3/1PN1B3/P2QBPPP/R4RK1 b - -',12. b3 - protecting c4.

I am always wary of my opponent's queen and want to remove her even at the cost of Glenda the Defender.  Perhaps Bh6 was worth considering but then black could have avoided the exchange of bishops by playing Bh8.

250,8,13,2h3,b'4r3/1p2pp2/p1rpbkp1/8/2P1P2p/1P3P1P/P1RRBKP1/8 b - -',24. h3 and again Ke3 here perhaps.

253,8,16,2Rcb2,b'2r5/1p2p3/p1rpbp2/4k1p1/2P1P2p/PP1BKP1P/1R1R2P1/8 b - -',28. Rb2 - rather planless.

255,8,18,3cxd6,b'2r5/1p2p3/3Pbp2/4k1p1/1P2P2p/r2BKP1P/1RR3P1/8 b - -',33. cxd6 - gameknot did not class this as an innaccuracy blunder or mistake but the red bar got just a little bit bigger all the same.
256,8,19,Kxd6,b'8/1p2p3/3kbp2/6p1/1P2P2p/r2BKP1P/2R3P1/8 w - -',34. .... Kxd6 - hmm he takes with the king and then retreats it by doing so.  But he has an idea up his sleeve and I do not see it until it is too late.
257,8,20,3Kd4,b'8/1p2p3/2k2p2/6p1/1PbKP2p/r2B1P1P/3R2P1/8 b - -',37. Kd4?! - here gameknot classed this king move as an innaccuracy and suggested e5 instead. Please refer to the link in my intro speech.  Hmm I suppose although that gives up a pawn it does split up black's kingside pawns and make them easy targets for Henry or my rook perhaps.
258,8,21,Kb5,b'8/1p6/5p2/1k2p1p1/1Pb1P2p/r2BKP1P/3R2P1/8 w - -',38. ..... Kb5 - my b pawn is about to drop off and black will have a passer on the b column so I decided to wave the white flag here.  Well played antagonistknight.  The only plus point about this game is that at least I did get into an endgame with a near master with even material so that is a little encouraging.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne

The exchange of the rook and queen is forced and Black has nothing. Here I resigned. So what makes this game so interesting to me? there are two things; 1) Despite the material defect Black was the one putting the pressure on White and White had to respond to Black's threats quite a few times. [Question: is that keeping the initiative?] 2) As I played through the games I honestly thought that I could pull off a surprise win until White's final move (and that win would have been my highest on Gameknot). Still it was a great game - thanks very much to my opponent! :)

Developing with say Qe2 or Qe1-h4 is probably more relevant to the struggle for the center. Still White will have to make this move eventually so it is safe at least.
593,20,3,1e5,b'r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/1b2PP2/2NB1N2/PPPB2PP/R2Q1R1K w - -',?! Striking out for freedom but a bit premature. …b5 and …Bb7 is more solid.

There is no longer any hope of clearing the way for the Bd3 or the Rf1. White should embrace the tension in the center since he is trying to open lines for his developed pieces. 12. f5 not only closes lines it also hands the center over to Black since without the f-pawn exerting pressure on Black's e-pawn there is nothing to hold back the freeing advance …d5. 
Instead Nd5! Nxd5 13. exd5 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 (Bxh7+?!? Kxh7 15. Ng5+ is tempting but after …Kg6! White has nothing better than Qxd2.) gives White a strong initiative."

600,20,10,1c3,b'r1b1r1k1/1pq2ppp/p1n2n2/4pP2/4B3/2P2N2/PP1B2PP/R3QR1K b - -',?! Again Rd1 was called for. There is no pressing need for c3 since c2 d4 and b4 are adequately covered. Even if the f3 Knight moved and Black did manage to get a Knight on d5 White could then play c3 with tempo and drive it away.
601,20,11,1Bg5,b'r1b1r1k1/2q2ppp/p1n2n2/1p2pPB1/4B3/2P2N2/PP4PP/R3QR1K b - -',! Putting the question to the Knight while Black has still not completed development. (I would usually have no problem with doubled pawns in return for a Bishop-for-Knight trade but here it would leave my King far too exposed.) Notice that neither White nor Black have been terribly concerned about the possibility of Nxe4 so far since as long as there's a pawn on f5 that Bishop is a non-factor. With the pawn's blockader about to go however the Bishop must be eliminated.
602,20,12,Bb7,b'r3r1k1/1bq2ppp/p1n5/1p2pPB1/4Q3/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',? A natural move that gets Black into big trouble. …f6! was necessary and good after which Black would have a very comfortable game. I actually considered playing it but underestimated White's threats and felt more comfortable breaking the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal. This oversight very well could have lost me the game!
603,20,13,2Qg4,b'r3r1k1/1bq2ppp/p1n5/1p2pPB1/6Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K b - -',! White immediately takes the initiative. Now the threats come very fast and there is no time for …f6 thanks to the pin on the g-file.

606,20,16,2g6,b'r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2Pp1/1p2p1B1/6Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',What else? ...Rg8 23 fxg7+ Rxg7 24 Bf6 is no good and so I am obliged to create holes around my King.

This phase of the attack is very instructive because of how Black simultaneously snuffs out Black's defensive resources while increasing his own threats. Here I had hoped to get in the liberating move ...h5 which would greatly slow down the White attack and give me time for counterplay. Instead White blockades the h-pawn and hones in on g7. The one downside is that the Queen's route to h7 h6 and/or g7 is temporarily blocked.
608,20,18,2e4,b'r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2PpB/1p6/4p1Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',"!? What to do? White not only has a big attack but has also prevented any immediately useful defensive move that Black might want to play. It might seem odd for me to ""force"" the White Knight to g5 where it already wanted to go anyways but this move is motivated by sound practical logic: Black is not going to be able to defend against White's attack -- my pieces on the Queenside are just not going to get there in time. My only hope for survival then depends on getting some kind of counterattack going. Pushing the pawn does three things to help that: 1) It clears the h2-b8 diagonal for the Queen while giving the e-Rook more scope on the e-file; 2) It controls the f3-square while opening e5 for the Knight; and 3) It disrupts the timing of White's attack. White would prefer to play Qh4 first and Ng5 second which retains control of e5 for a turn longer but now he doesn't have that choice."
609,20,19,Ne5,b'r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p4PpB/1p2n1N1/4p1Q1/2P5/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',"!? Again forcing a move that White planned to play anyways. Now however Black's formerly pent-up pieces are starting to take up active posts in the center. White needs to be careful not to underestimate this activity. (As they say: ""The best way to meet an attack on the flank is with an attack in the center."") "
610,20,20,Kg8,b'r3r1k1/1bq2p1p/p4PpB/1p2n1N1/4p2Q/2P5/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',! White threatened Bg7+ Kg8 26. Qxh7#. Now Bg7 can be met with ...h5 and White's attack has stalled. Still White's pieces seem extremely threatening and the situation is optically very grim for Black. For one thing Nxh7 looks very strong. The Black position contains hidden resources which are easy to underestimate however and the game is far from over. My opponent thinking I was on the ropes probably expected a resignation soon after his next move…
611,20,21,2Nxh7,b'r3r1k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p2n3/4p2Q/2P5/PP4PP/R4R1K b - -',? This seemingly crushing move actually loses for White! How? ...Kxh7 26. Bg7+ Kg8 27. Qh8# seems pretty convincing...
612,20,22,2Nf3,b'r3r1k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p6/4p2Q/2P2n2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - -',"But Black doesn't have to take the Knight! This counter-sacrifice neutralizes White's attack completely. The attacking White pieces which seemed so  menacing a few moves ago now trip over each other clumsily -- the f-pawn blocks f6 from the Knight while the Knight and Bishop temporarily block the h-file for the White Queen as effectively as if they were Black pawns.
After this move Black poses a series of powerful threats which do not allow White the time to rearrange his pieces and continue the attack. By repeatedly activating my pieces while forcing White into reactive mode I am able to completely shift the initiative to Black. 
 
It seems clear that White did not have the option of moving the Knight away from the defense of f3 last move and so developing with Re1 seems best with the dangerous plan of Re1-e3-h3 for example which is hard for Black to meet. White needed to continue the slow buildup of an attack by mixing threats with prophylaxis as seen before. Still while it seems clear in hindsight that 26. Nxh7 is a mistake it is hard to criticize a move that wins convincingly in all variations except for one improbable sacrifice. White was understandably eager to cash in on the strong attacking position he had built up with patience and care and in his position I would have hardly expected the tables to turn so quickly either."
613,20,23,2gxf3,b'r3r1k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p6/4p2Q/2P2P2/PP5P/R4R1K b - -',? Instead of accepting the sacrifice White could have gone for the endgame after Qh3 Qxh2+ 28. Qxh2 Nxh2 29. Kxh2 Kxh7 where Black may have a slight edge due to better-placed Rooks and the vulnerability of the f-pawn but White has good chances for equality. Though objectively speaking Qh3 gives good chances to hold while the text move loses outright I cannot blame my opponent for continuing to play for a win in a position which had seemed so overwhelmingly better just a move ago. The Knight sacrifice seemed desperate even to me and I doubt that many players of our level would have seriously considered declining it.
614,20,24,2exf3,b'r3r1k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p6/7Q/2P2p2/PP5P/R4R1K w - -',The first surprise threat: ...f2+ is mate in two.

After Kg1 Black has a number of good options. One simple path to advantage is ...Qc5+ 29 Qf2/d4 (Rf2 Re4 as in the game except that White has self-pinned) and after the trade of Queens and ...Kxh7 we again come to a much better ending for Black. I would not be surprised however if Black could try for even more by keeping the Queens on with 28...Re4."
616,20,26,2Re4,b'r5k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p6/4r2Q/2P2p2/PP3R1P/R6K w - -',Threat number 2 dislodging the Queen while clearing space for the a-Rook.
617,20,27,2Qg5,b'r5k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p4Q1/4r3/2P2p2/PP3R1P/R6K b - -',?! It would be more challenging to play Qh3 after which Black still has the same crushing attack as in the game but at least White has some material to show for it in case Black messes up. Now I can win back my piece without disrupting my attack in any real way.
618,20,28,2Rae8,b'4r1k1/1bq2p1N/p4PpB/1p4Q1/4r3/2P2p2/PP3R1P/R6K w - -',! Threat number 3. Even if Black wasn't threatening mate on e1 the Knight still has nowhere to go and Black is in no hurry to round it up. In the last three moves Black has been able to activate every piece for the attack while White's position has not improved in any real way and the White pieces are no longer well placed for attack or defense. I was even startled by how fast things had turned around let alone my shocked opponent!
619,20,29,Kxh7,b'4r3/1bq2p1k/p4PpB/1p6/4r3/2P2p2/PP3R1P/R5QK w - -',Recovering the piece with yet another gain of time. (Threat number 4?)

A bit of prophylaxis mixed with increased pressure on the f-Rook. ...Re2 is the obvious move and as far as I can tell it is completely sufficient to win but after Qg3! White would all of a sudden be threatening a lot of cheap tricks on the h-file and g7 square. There are several lines where White can just sac the f-Rook and mate my King. While Black should be able to avoid that fate with careful play I figured that this game had already seen enough surprise twists and I wanted to carefully exclude any possibility of a White counterattack before going in for the kill.

Of course the prosaic computer sees none of the beauty in my concept and has Black launching a Queenside frolic with his own Q:

In the middlegame I won a pawn and my mating attack fizzled out.  It looked as if I would make no headway whatsoever.  Then John made a pawn move and allowed a rook incursion onto h7.  John tried to save his pawn but it lead to a rook fork on his king and knight.  He tried to save his knight by protecting it with his king only for him to lose his king oops!

At least this move connects my two rooks and with the queens off the board Henry is relatively safe on e2.

This would create another set of targets for black to defend.

Even I could see that move was bad although I had to analyse carefully before playing my rook to h7.  The rook move to h7 is very strong because it results in another pawn drop for black.

944,36,1,d5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6',I might give the KID a try in one of the remaining games I have a general knowledge of the lines of the defence but never played it at a serious level.
945,36,2,Rb1,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/1RBQKB1R b Kkq -',I don't know what happened with the popularity of this line. A few years ago just about every top GM was playing this line some of them with both colours. Now they've switched to more conventional lines and I haven't seen any recent game with this line. I guess it's more a matter of fashion than anything else.
946,36,3,cxd4,b'rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3pP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R w K -',The older line starts with 9...Nc6 but that is hardly played anymore since it gives White a very pleasant middlegame and the only line where Black keeps the balance involves transferring the Bg7 to a5.

948,36,5,1Bd2,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP3/5N2/P2BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K -',The endgame after 11. Qd2 Qxd2+ 12. Bxd2 is no problem for Black. Without the Queens it's much easier to make use of the Q-side pawn majority.
949,36,6,1O-O,b'rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',I was recently reading a book by Bronstein on the K-K match in Seville where Karpov played this variation but opted for the Queen exchange which Kasparov easily drew. One comment said that sacrificing a pawn like this leads to nowhere after 12...b6 13. Qc1. Little did they know about the times to come. The most pertinent game in that line is Ivanchuck - Svidler Linares 1998 where White slowly used his central control to build up his position to achieve a winning advantage.
950,36,7,1Bg4,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',The modern way of handling the variation. Black wastes no time in completing his development. 12...Nd7 is another attempt to clench the position without returning material but it gives White a very free hand and Black has to confide himself to the back three ranks for quite some time.
951,36,8,1Bg5,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/6B1/3PP1b1/5N2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',13. Rxb7 is hardly played anymore since it's ancient knowledge that after 13...Bxf3 14. Bxf3 Bxd4 Black has more than equalized. However 13. Be3 is another matter altogether.
952,36,9,1h6,b'rn3rk1/pp2ppb1/6pp/6B1/3PP1b1/5N2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',Forcing this move is the point of the Bishop maneuver. White wants to weaken g6 in case a Bishop might come to the a2-g8 diagonal.

954,36,11,1Nc6,b'r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',"Developing the last piece and putting more pressure on d4. Central pressure is the main way that Black can achieve counterplay in the Gruenfeld and it's also one of the reasons why Black has no ""bad"" pieces i.e. the Bc8 is bad for Black in quite a few systems the Benoni and the French the Bf8 is bad in some lines of the Kid the Nb8 is bad in some lines of the Ruy Lopez and again in some KID lines. But one of the perks of the Gruenfeld is that Black has no bad pieces in almost all the lines everything on the board works together provided you know what you're doing and this game is a good example of that. For example in this position all the three light pieces create pressure on the d4 pawn which was the reason why the first Knight and the two pawns were exchanged in the opening. It's interesting to note that the Qa2 isn't necessarily misplaced. I'm sure many chessplayers have seen the very good game Nimzowitsch - Capablanca St. Petersburg 1914 where White lost just because he withdrew his Queen from the enemy camp after capturing a pawn and lost just enough time to hand the initiative over to the Cuban who never returned the favour and won the game in a modern fashion."
955,36,12,1d5,b'r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/3P4/4P1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',The best way to relieve the pressure on the d4 pawn. Other moves don't promise White anything. Now Black has to make a difficult choice. Not only where to move the Knight but if to capture on f3 before. 15...Na5 is considered weaker here mainly because h6 has been played. Also I remembered reading an old article by Khalifman about his game with Leko which was just whitewashed after 15...Ne5. So I chose to exchange on f3 first in order to make the e5 square more secure.
956,36,13,1Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/3P4/4P3/4Bb2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - -',White has to recapture on f3 now and he has a difficult choice before him. There are good points to each recapture. For example capturing with the pawn gets rid of the back rank weakness strengthens the pawn chain and especially the e-pawn in case the e-file should open it also keeps the Bishop available to come to the a2-g8 diagonal and make use of the weakened Black K-side. The drawback is that it weakens the squares around the King and especially h2. Capturing with the Bishop doesn't create any weakness it also puts the unopposed Bishop on the long diagonal but behind its own pawn and it also gives Black a relatively stable Knight on e5. In my database the pawn recapture is played more often and with better results probably for the reasons given above.
957,36,14,1Bxf3,b'r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/3P4/4P3/4BB2/q4PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - -',My opponent chose not to mangle his own pawns but like I said earlier now the Knight can come safely to e5.
958,36,15,1Rxb7,b'r4rk1/pR2ppb1/6pp/3Pn3/4P3/4BB2/q4PPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',Restoring material equality and invading my seventh rank. It's all in good measure since the pawn centre has been fixed the Bishop pair isn't doing much at the moment and the best pawn has been preserved.
959,36,16,1a5,b'r4rk1/1R2ppb1/6pp/p2Pn3/4P3/4BB2/q4PPP/3Q1RK1 w - a6',A very good line for counterplay. I believe Black has equalized here because even though White's d-pawn is closer to the Queening square it's less supported than Black's. Also by advancing the pawn the Ra8 is directly activated and thus the time lost in capturing the a2 pawn is restored.
960,36,17,a4,b'r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4BB2/q4PPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',White has won another pawn but the Rook is more stranded than the Black Queen and it will need to waste time to return to a safe square. Also the Qa2 is a better piece to support the advancement of the pawn than the Re7.
961,36,18,1Be2,b'r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4B3/q3BPPP/3Q1RK1 b - -',This is almost an acknowledgement of the wrong choice of recapture on move 16. White wants to cover c4 and be ready to kick the Knight with f4. The game in my database continues with 19. Bd4 and that looks like a better move even though it allows Black to equalize comfortably.
962,36,19,1Qb2,b'r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4B3/1q2BPPP/3Q1RK1 w - -',Remember the point about not retreating pieces that exert pressure on the enemy position? With this quite shuffle the path of the pawn is cleared and the key move 20. Bd4 is prevented after with would follow 20...Nf3+ 21. gxf3 Bxd4 and with opposite coloured Bishops the a-pawn is even more dangerous.
963,36,20,2Kh1,b'r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4B3/1q2BPPP/3Q1R1K b - -',An interesting move White wants to remove the tactical idea of Nf3 and carry on with Bd4 and f4 exchange my powerful Bishop and start advancing his d-pawn.
964,36,21,2Qb4,b'r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/pq2P3/4B3/4BPPP/3Q1R1K w - -',The problem with White's last is that it's too slow. Now after this simple double attack I can force the White Rook of its active position capture the e-pawn and thus weaken the d-pawn forestall the plan with Bd4 and f4 all the while keeping my prospects of pushing the a-pawn.
965,36,22,2Rc7,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pn3/pq2P3/4B3/4BPPP/3Q1R1K b - -',There is no choice here. If 21. d6 then 21...a3 is very strong. Play could continue 22. Bxh6 (removing the Bishop from the dangerous diagonal) Bxh6 23. Rxe5 a2 24. Rb5 Qxe4 25. Bf3 (even this doesn't prove sufficient) Qc4 26. Bxa8 Rxa8 27. Rb1 (a sad necessity the threat was Qxf1 followed by a1Q) bxa1Q 28. Qxb1 Qd4 29. Rd1 Bd2 and White's last hope the d-pawn will fall and with him the game. Playing for tricks with 21. Rxe5 Bxe5 22. Bxh6 again fails to 22...a3 and the passed pawn is just too powerful. White doesn't even have the chance to sacrifice the Bishop he has to surrender a full Rook for it. White's move in the game is definitely best but it seems insufficient. 
966,36,23,2Qxe4,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3q3/4B3/4BPPP/3Q1R1K w - -',I managed to win back a pawn and not give White anything in return. The central position of the Queen still hampers the plan with Bd4 and f4 for example if 22. Bd4 then 22...Rfd8 and the weakness of the d5 pawn is swiftly revealed. If White carries on with 23. f4 then Rxd5 calms his temper.
967,36,24,2Qd2,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3q3/4B3/3QBPPP/5R1K b - -',It seems White has given up hope of exchanging Bishops on d4 and instead would be content to just chase the Knight away.
968,36,25,2a3,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pn3/4q3/p3B3/3QBPPP/5R1K w - -',One step closer. On a3 the pawn will be very safe since it could be defended with Bf8 in case it comes under heavy fire.
969,36,26,2f3,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pn3/4q3/p3BP2/3QB1PP/5R1K b - -',My opponent must have been sick of the hyperactive Queen and decided that she must retreat to her side of the board.
970,36,27,2Qf5,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pnq2/8/p3BP2/3QB1PP/5R1K w - -',Keeping the Queen in control of the White squares namely d3 and c2 which could be invaded if White gets sloppy.
971,36,28,2g4,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/6pp/3Pnq2/6P1/p3BP2/3QB2P/5R1K b - g3',A committal move that perhaps wasn't necessary. Incidentally I have only one space to retreat the Queen but it's a very good square at that.
972,36,29,2Qf6,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/5qpp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/3QB2P/5R1K w - -',From b2 the Queen has taken quite a side-trip to f6 doubling on the long diagonal preventing any attempt of a blockade on the a-file. 25. Bd4 still isn't possible because of Nxf3 and 25. f4 is refuted very nicely by 25...Nxg4 26. Bxg4 a2 27. d7 a1Q 28. Rxa1 Rxa1+ 29. Kg2 Rd8 30. d7 Qa6!
973,36,30,2Qa2,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/5qpp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/Q3B2P/5R1K b - -',The Queen is the only piece than is available to stop the pawn advancing. My Bishop Queen and Knight coordinate very nicely to stop White from redeploying his Bishops to the Q-side in order to blockade.
974,36,31,2Qd6,b'r4rk1/2R2pb1/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/Q3B2P/5R1K w - -',Keeping the active pace and not giving White time to regroup. Both Queens have now assumed the unworthy role of blockading the opponents passed pawn while defending their own. Quite an interesting arrangement. But because my pawn is a marginal one that means that White's Queen is less active than my own.
975,36,32,2Rc2,b'r4rk1/5pb1/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/Q1R1B2P/5R1K b - -',No time for doubling Rooks since after 26. Rfc1 the simple Rab8 White is forced to give way 27. R7c2 Rb2! 28. Rxb2 axb2 29. Rd1 (29. Qxb2 Nxg4) Rc8! and everything ties in nicely for Black the passed pawn is the clear hero on the board.
976,36,33,2Rfc8,b'r1r3k1/5pb1/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/Q1R1B2P/5R1K w - -',It's a good idea to exchange Rooks since that means there will be fewer pieces to cover the Queening square.
977,36,34,2Rxc8+,b'r1R3k1/5pb1/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p3BP2/Q3B2P/5R1K b - -',This feels rushed better was the sturdier 27. Rcc1 and it will be much harder to break White's position.
978,36,35,2Bc1,b'2r3k1/5pb1/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p4P2/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',Attacking the a-pawn but also retreating to the first rank. White's position is hard in any case and it's difficult to make a worthy suggestion.
979,36,36,2Bf8,b'2r2bk1/5p2/3q2pp/3Pn3/6P1/p4P2/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',The pawn is safe now and the two remaining pieces can be used to attempt a breakthrough the blockade.
980,36,37,2f4,b'2r2bk1/5p2/3q2pp/3Pn3/5PP1/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',White finally kicks the Knight from its central position but it weakens even more his King's position.
981,36,38,2Nd7,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/3q2pp/3P4/5PP1/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',Again there is only one place to put the Knight but it's sufficient. Now the Knight can come to f6 to attack d5 and g4.
982,36,39,3g5,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/3q2pp/3P2P1/5P2/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',Taking away the f6 square for the Knight but the g-pawn might prove weak in the endgame.
983,36,40,3hxg5,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/3q2p1/3P2p1/5P2/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',I always like fixing weak pawns. Now the Rf1 is semi-activated but with the pawn on d5 there is no way to reinforce the attack on f7.
984,36,41,3fxg5,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/3q2p1/3P2P1/8/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',There is another point to exchanging on g5. The e5 square is again available for the Knight.
985,36,42,3Qb4,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/6p1/3P2P1/1q6/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',The exposed position of the White King gives me plenty of tactical possibilities the threat is Rxc1 followed by Qe4+ Qe3+ and Qxc1. That's if White does nothing about it.
986,36,43,3d6,b'2r2bk1/3n1p2/3P2p1/6P1/1q6/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',White takes the opportunity to activate his Queen and threaten f7. This also defends against the crude threat of Rxc1 because of the intermediate Qxf7+ enabling White to play Bf3 and avoid the tactical line given earlier.
987,36,44,3Ne5,b'2r2bk1/5p2/3P2p1/4n1P1/1q6/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',Coming back to the centre and covering the weakspot f7. This Knight move covers all the tricks and sets up some on its own. For example if 33. Qxa3 then Qe4+ 34. Bf3 Nxf3 35. Qxf3 Qxf3+ 36. Rxf3 Rxc1+ 37. Kg2 Bxd6 and Black is up a full piece.
988,36,45,3d7,b'2r2bk1/3P1p2/6p1/4n1P1/1q6/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K b - -',One last trick. The Knight is overloaded and can't take the pawn.
989,36,46,3Qb7+,b'2r2bk1/1q1P1p2/6p1/4n1P1/8/p7/Q3B2P/2B2R1K w - -',But White isn't the only one with tricks up his sleeve.
990,36,47,3Bf3,b'2r2bk1/1q1P1p2/6p1/4n1P1/8/p4B2/Q6P/2B2R1K b - -',The whole idea of the pawn sacrifice is to active the White piece and triple the attack on f7.
991,36,48,3Bd5,b'2r2bk1/3q1p2/6p1/3Bn1P1/8/p7/Q6P/2B2R1K b - -',White seems to have setup a nice battery directed at my King.
992,36,49,3Qh3,b'2r2bk1/5p2/6p1/3Bn1P1/8/p6q/Q6P/2B2R1K w - -',But not all that glitters is gold. The tactical justification for this move lies in 36. Bxf7+ Kh8 and after this simple retreat White is overstretched and has nothing better than 37. Qg2 Qxg2+ 38. Kxg2 Rc2+ 39. Kh1 Nxf7 40. Bxa3 Bxa3 41. Rxf7 Bc1 with a technical won ending.
993,36,50,3Bg2,b'2r2bk1/5p2/6p1/4n1P1/8/p6q/Q5BP/2B2R1K b - -',White decides that simplifications don't suit him so he retreats and keeps the tension in the position.
994,36,51,3Qd3,b'2r2bk1/5p2/6p1/4n1P1/8/p2q4/Q5BP/2B2R1K w - -',But once the d-pawn is gone my Queen is free to roam the board.
995,36,52,3Bf4,b'2r2bk1/5p2/6p1/4n1P1/5B2/p2q4/Q5BP/5R1K b - -',White gives up on attacking the pawn and tries to undermine the strong central Knight. An interesting variation starts with 37. Qd5 Qxf1+ 38. Bxf1 Rxc1 39. Kg1 Ng4 40. Qa5 Bc5+ 41. Kg2 Ne3+ 42. Kf3 Rxf1+ 43. Ke2 Rc1 the Black pieces coordinate very nice and the lone Queen is almost pushed off the board.
996,36,53,3Rc2,b'5bk1/5p2/6p1/4n1P1/5B2/p2q4/Q1r3BP/5R1K w - -',Now it's time to remove the blockader.

998,36,55,3Rc5,b'5bk1/5p2/6p1/2rQn1P1/5B2/p2q4/6BP/5R1K w - -',A positional finesse the point being to deny White the chance to activate the light square Bishop.
999,36,56,3Qxd3,b'5bk1/5p2/6p1/2r1n1P1/5B2/p2Q4/6BP/5R1K b - -',White goes for the Queen swap I can't blame or commend his decision the game is over in either case.

It's pretty hard to say where he went wrong since he never played a bad move just small inaccuracies that slowly worsen his position to the point where there was no salvation. If I were to give question marks to White's move it would be his 16th where gxf3 would have been more critical his 19th where he missed a good chance to play Bd4 20th move would be given a ""?!"" since 20.
