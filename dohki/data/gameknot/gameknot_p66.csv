12,1,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',I played as black in this game. I'm still trying to learn the basics of the Kings Indian and won this game because of sheer luck. Of course I'd rather not like to win this way and would like any input you guys can give.
13,1,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A flexible response. I can still go d5 and transpose if I wish as well as do many other things.
14,1,2,c4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3',I'm not grabbing the center so he is.
15,1,3,g6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Preparing Bg7.
16,1,4,d6,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Here he can't play e5 because after the exchanges his knight will have had to move backward losing time. 
17,1,5,Nf3,b'rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',I debated Bg4 here. However White could just kick it away with h3 since Bh5 loses the Bishop.
18,1,6,O-O,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',This seemed more natural to me.
19,1,7,Be2,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ -',I would say Bd3 is better but my f7 g6 h7 pawn formation seems to make that less appealing. The LSB for white seems a bit useless for the time being.
20,1,8,e5,b'rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ e6',While it looks like this loses a pawn I don't think it does because after dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4! With a discovered attack on the e5 Knight.
21,1,9,Bg5,b'rnbr2k1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQ -',This came as a shock to me. I think the best move here would have just been to move the rook seeing what happened.

26,1,14,Rf8,b'r1b2rk1/ppNn1pbp/6p1/4p1B1/2P1n3/5N2/PP2BPPP/2KR3R w - -',I didn't want to let him have my more active rook.
27,1,15,Nxh1,b'2b2rk1/ppNn1pbp/6p1/4p1B1/2P5/5N2/PP2B1PP/2KR3n w - -',This will at least slow him down a little.
28,1,16,f6,b'2b2rk1/ppNn2bp/5pp1/4p1B1/2P5/5N2/PP2B1PP/2K4R w - -',My only chance here was to try and push the e pawn. Sadly I think this position is probably lost for black at this point with proper play.
29,1,17,1Rd1,b'2b2rk1/p1Nn2bp/1p3pp1/4p3/2P5/4BN2/PP2B1PP/2KR4 b - -',A better move here I thought was Ne6 gaining the Bishop pair. Also his extended Knight could be a liability.
30,1,18,1Nc5,b'2b2rk1/p1N3bp/1p3pp1/2n1p3/2P5/4BN2/PP2B1PP/2KR4 w - -',After doing the calculations white doesn't win a pawn here after Bishop takes.
31,1,19,Rf7,b'2b3k1/p1N2rbp/5pp1/2pRp3/2P5/5N2/PP2B1PP/2K5 w - -',Now if Rxc5 I hav Bf8. and if Rc6 I have Bb7 winning a piece.
32,1,20,Rf8,b'2bR1rk1/p1N3bp/5pp1/2p1p3/2P5/5N2/PP2B1PP/2K5 w - -',Forced.
33,1,21,2Nd2,b'2b2k2/p1N3bp/5pp1/2p1p3/2P5/8/PP1NB1PP/2K5 b - -',With looks at Ne4 and Nb3. Both look very good attacking the c5 pawn.
34,1,22,2Bh6,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/5ppb/2p1p3/2P5/8/PP1NB1PP/2K5 w - -',Giving new life to the DSB. This bishop is going to be my savior since it can't be challenged easily.
35,1,23,2Kc2,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/5ppb/2p1p3/2P5/8/PPKNB1PP/8 b - -',Getting out of the pin.
36,1,24,2f5,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/6pb/2p1pp2/2P5/8/PPKNB1PP/8 w - -',I need to move as quick as possible.
37,1,25,Be3,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/6p1/2p1pp2/2P5/1N2b3/PPK1B1PP/8 w - -',And the pawn will hold at least for now.
38,1,26,Bg1,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/6p1/2p1pp2/2P5/1N1K4/PP2B1PP/6b1 w - -',I didn't plan on taking with Bxh2 here. I don't want that c pawn to become passed. Also white will have too much activity after Nxc5.
39,1,27,2h3,b'2b2k2/p1N4p/6p1/2p1pp2/2P5/1N1K3P/PP2B1P1/6b1 b - -',He played this anyway. I guess he didn't like the tactics or something.

41,1,29,2Nb5,b'2b5/p4k1p/6p1/1Np1pp2/2P5/1N1K3P/PP2B1P1/6b1 b - -',Threatens Nxa7 and Nd6+
42,1,30,2Nxa7,b'2b5/N6p/4k1p1/2p1pp2/2P5/1N1K3P/PP2B1P1/6b1 b - -',I'm down 3 points now... and he has a passed pawn too.
43,1,31,2Bf3,b'8/Nb5p/4k1p1/2p1pp2/2P5/1N1K1B1P/PP4P1/6b1 b - -',This was probably the main reason I won. One blunder can cost the game some times.
44,1,32,3gxf3,b'8/Nb5p/4k1p1/2p2p2/2P5/1N3P1P/PP2K3/6b1 b - -',He still is up a pawn but I have too much activity now.
45,1,33,Kg3,b'8/7p/2bN2p1/2p2p2/P1P5/1P4kP/3K4/8 w - -',He resigned here. Let me know what you guys think and give me lots of pointers! :D Oh and if anyone wants to play me as white and play the kings Indian rated or unrated message me or challenge me and I'll play. It has to be the Kings Indian though! lol
46,2,0,Bc4,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq -',Personally I prefer 3. Bb5 for more of a Ruy Lopez approach but this is a good alternative and accomplishes the same goal: develops the piece and prepares for castle. As Hicks points out and as I tell my over-the-board students: the best opening moves accomplish multiple goals!
47,2,1,Bc5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',The Giuoco Piano in which the goals are for white:  to take control of the center with a d4 push. White must choose if he does it right now--4. d4 to get a lead in development (despite the loss of the pawn)--or if he prepares it with moves like 4. c3 or 4. b4. White may also forget about the d4-push and play a quieter line by supporting the center with 4. d3. But these are too conventional for white's tastes...
48,2,2,b4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq b3',!? - Instead white elects to go for an Evans Gambit in which the goal is to trade a pawn for better center position.
49,2,3,Bxb4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Black takes as most people who see this line do. After all even the original annotator says the best way to refute a gambit is to accept the offer.
50,2,4,Ba5,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq -',Played to keep pressure on c3. After d4(?) c3 is pinned
51,2,5,O-O,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq -',3rd goal of the chess opening? Protect the king! This standard move fixes the pin problem and makes d4 a playable move again.
52,2,6,Nf6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq -',!? - A good move since the pawn on c3 makes e4 difficult to defend and ideally would allow black to castle as well...
53,2,7,Ba3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2B1P3/B1P2N2/P2P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq -',However as many people will tell you offense is the best defense. Ignoring the attack on e4 white invites black to take it knowing that this opens the e-file for the white rook giving him a positional edge! This move also prevents black from castling which will become a problem later in the game.
54,2,8,Bb6,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/2B1P3/B1P2N2/P2P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq -',Attacks d4 as black looks to prepare for an attack on the center.
55,2,9,Qb3,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/8/2BpP3/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Develops the queen and attacks f7!
56,2,10,d5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/3p4/2BpP3/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN3RK1 w kq d6',?! - a dubious move as black's king hasn't castled yet and is stuck in the middle. On the flip side there is not much else he can do to defend f7. Bad positions force bad moves.
57,2,11,1exd5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn2n2/3P4/2Bp4/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN3RK1 b kq -',Opens the e-file for the rook to attack the king! Time to make black pay for not castling.
58,2,12,1Na5,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1b3n2/n2P4/2Bp4/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN3RK1 w kq -',Black's plan? Trade and simplify. It's really his only hope.
59,2,13,Be6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b2bn2/n2P4/2Bp4/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN2R1K1 w kq -',Quiz for you spectators: Why isn't Kd7 an option here? (Hint: The move made is the only good move for black!)
60,2,14,1dxe6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b2Pn2/n7/2Bp4/BQP2N2/P4PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq -',!! - a beautiful queen sacrifice.
61,2,15,Kc6,b'r2q3r/ppp2Ppp/1bk1Bn2/8/3p4/BnP2N2/P4PPP/RN2R1K1 w - -',An exposed king = no es bueno for anyone.
62,2,16,1Ne5+,b'r2q3r/ppp2Ppp/1bk1Bn2/4N3/3p4/BnP5/P4PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',Time for white to make the most of the queen sacrifice. One bad move and black can sneak back into the game.
63,2,17,1axb3#,b'r2q3r/ppp2Ppp/1b3n2/4N3/kBBp4/1PP5/5PPP/RN2R1K1 b - -',A beautiful finish! Lesson of this game: Castle! And if your opponent doesn't look for and capitalize on the weak square f7 (and/or f2).
64,3,0,e5,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',here white could not to take but he choose to capture
65,3,1,Qe7,b'r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/1bP2Bn1/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',this move actually sets up a trap which my opponent bit on

70,4,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',My traditional opening.
71,4,1,d3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',I normally play my bishop at this point. 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 xc6 5. Nxe5 f6 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. O-O is what I usually experience or something along those lines. I didn't do it here this time.
72,4,2,Nc3,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',Getting my knights out.

76,4,6,Bd2,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',I didn't want my pawn structure to be messed up or unbalanced so I got the other bishop involved.
77,4,7,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/4P3/2BP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',Now I can castle.

79,4,9,Bg4,b'r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/4P1b1/2BP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',He does the same strategy he just did with my other knight.

I probably would of attacked black's f g and h pawns so I could engage my f g and h pawns so I could get more strong pieces to make checkmate easier. Checkmate is hard to do right now. dfb1 though knew that he would lose his queen and that I would still have a queen and so on. He resigned and this wonderful game was over.

202,8,36,Kg6,b'8/p7/6k1/1p2p1pp/1P2P3/P1P3K1/8/8 w - -',Here I resign as I can't think of how I can stop black from promoting a pawn.
203,9,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',So like me he starts off with the most common opening.
204,9,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',Standard.
205,9,2,Nf3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -',Also standard.
206,9,3,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',?! I understand this move in the sense that it develops since black just advanced his other center pawn.  However this is inaccurate and better was 2...d5 as after 3.exd5 Qxd5  This move however compromises space for his DSB so that he'll either have to cram it or waste time to get it out.  
207,9,4,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3',So white decides to take advantage of that with this move.  The idea behind it is to keep that B crammed by exchanging and that's about to happen.
208,9,5,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',So black decides to bring another piece out.
209,9,6,Bg5,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/6B1/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',Of course white decides to pin that N and that's something that I also would have done.
210,9,7,h6,b'rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/6B1/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',Very understandable and it is a good way to get out of it.  And instead of retreating on h4 followed by g3 chicoboy is going to exchange his DSB for black's N.  However I would've liked 5...Bf7 and it's the most common way to break the pin.  Jack Stockel told me that both ways wheather the opponent develops his B or brings out his P like this are both equally common.  But what I especially like about 5...Bf7 is that it would have developed another piece whereas this is not a developing move.  
211,9,8,c3,b'rnb1kb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/8/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq -',In this position white thought that his N was in danger and this move does protect it.  However Gerhard's d N was not in danger because of his Q.  In my mind better was 7.Nc3.  The problem with this move is that it doesn't develop anything and in fact takes away a square that would normally be used to get the b1 Knight out.  In addition this makes it less safe for white to castle K side.
212,9,9,c5,b'rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/3p1q1p/2p5/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq c6',"And now black is trying to find a weakness with this move.  I figured it out the reason that I've been into attacking material all has to do with tempo gain and this is exactly what this move does.  As IM elyhim put it ""Gaining tempo is like taking money out of your opponents and depositing it in your own bank.""  Well that is the case here because once white retreats black will be able to develop another piece."
213,9,10,Be7,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq -',As noted earlier because black played 2...d6 as opposed to 2...d5 this is the consequence.  While it might appear that having a crammed bishop isn't a problem it's actually quite serious because it will make it very difficult to near impossible for black to control the center given that the center is not well coordinated for black.
214,9,11,Nbd2,b'rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',So although slightly crammed it's less then black and this move actually gives white an advantage all of a sudden.  Now both players are equal in terms of development but white's center is better coordinated and should be able to control within the next few moves.
215,9,12,Bg4,b'rn2k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2p5/4P1b1/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',So black now decides to pin white's N.
216,9,13,1h3,b'rn2k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2p5/4P1b1/2P2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',As noted and implied earlier I would have played 10.Be2 instead.
217,9,14,1Bh5,b'rn2k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2p4b/4P3/2P2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq -',This time however no exchange.  Instead black retreats but I'm not crazy about this at all.  Instead I would've exchanged because once white reattacks with 11.g4 black has to retreat again after which white can finally complete develop after 12.Bb5+.
218,9,15,Nc6,b'r3k2r/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/1Bp5/4P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1N1P2/R2QK2R w KQkq -',But black's also completely developed.  The only difference as noted earlier however is that white's center is controlled whereas black is not so chicoboy has a noticeable edge at this point.
219,9,16,1Qe2,b'r3k2r/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/1Bp5/4P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/R3K2R b KQkq -',And now white's remaining piece out.  The only thing left is for him to castle.
220,9,17,1O-O,b'r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/1Bp5/4P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/R3K2R w KQ -',And that however is something that black does.
221,9,18,1Bc4,b'r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/2p5/2B1P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/R3K2R b KQ -',I don't know why white played this because his LSB is not attacked.
222,9,19,1Rfe8,b'r3r1k1/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/2p5/2B1P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/R3K2R w KQ -',?! The goal here is for black to put pressure on the e file.  However in my opinion this move is an inaccuracy because Jack Stockel told that it's generally a bad idea to bring both of your R's on the same file.  
223,9,20,1O-O-O,b'r3r1k1/pp2bpp1/2np1qbp/2p5/2B1P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/2KR3R b - -',!? Yes white does castle but in my mind this is not his best move.  In fact it's risky because in general with this position being a perfect a example castling Q side often leaves your K vulnerable to exposure and this is a well known fact.  Therefore castling K side so 15.0-0 was best in my mind.
224,9,21,1a6,b'r3r1k1/1p2bpp1/p1np1qbp/2p5/2B1P1P1/2P2N1P/PP1NQP2/2KR3R w - -',I don't know why black played this.
225,9,22,1Qe3,b'r3r1k1/1p2bpp1/p1np1qbp/2p5/2B1P1P1/2P1QN1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R b - -',I'm not sure what this move accomplishes.
226,9,23,1Na5,b'r3r1k1/1p2bpp1/p2p1qbp/n1p5/2B1P1P1/2P1QN1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R w - -',At this point black intends to exchange white's B for his N.  Not exactly sure why because in this position a N is worth more then a B.
227,9,24,1Bd5,b'r3r1k1/1p2bpp1/p2p1qbp/n1pB4/4P1P1/2P1QN1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R b - -',But white is not going to allow that.  However I would've exchanged because that would have immediately created a weakness.
228,9,25,1Rab8,b'1r2r1k1/1p2bpp1/p2p1qbp/n1pB4/4P1P1/2P1QN1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R w - -',Putting pressure on the b file.
229,9,26,1e5,b'1r2r1k1/1p2bpp1/p2p1qbp/n1pBP3/6P1/2P1QN1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R b - -',? Now white is going for an exchange.  At this point black better be careful because his Q is left en-prise.  And if he doesn't find the right move white will win for something worth less.   But this however is a mistake because if black finds the right move he will wind up a pawn ahead.  
230,9,27,1Qxf3,b'1r2r1k1/1p2bpp1/p2p2bp/n1pBP3/6P1/2P1Qq1P/PP1N1P2/2KR3R w - -',?? This is the wrong move.  Best was 18...dxe5 in this position as black would be a pawn ahead.  As noted earlier with this move however white wins koki's Q for a N.
231,9,28,dxe5,b'1r2r1k1/1p2bpp1/p5bp/n1pBp3/6P1/2P1QN1P/PP3P2/2KR3R w - -',Now is a good time for black to take but he's still behind.  The question will he be able to come back?  That remains to be seen.
232,9,29,2Qxe5,b'1r2r1k1/1p2bpp1/p5bp/n1pBQ3/6P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/2KR3R b - -',?? This capture however is also a blunder.  It looks like a very good move and in general appears worthy of a !.  But it's not a good idea to get attempted because it's well known that what looks good can be and sometimes is bad.  This is an example.  It looks like white won back a pawn however this move will allow black to win back the Q for a B and P after a discover a check on his next move.
233,9,30,Re7,b'1r4k1/1p2rpp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP3P2/2KR3R w - -',I don't know why black played this maybe it was to put pressure on the e file.  However best was a R fork with the immediate 22...Re5! winning a free piece this time henceforth giving black the advantage.
234,9,31,2Rhe1,b'1r4k1/1p2rpp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP3P2/2KRR3 b - -',! This is a good move because in general as per what Mr. Stockel told me while unlike with development and controlling the center there's no rush with this.  But it's a good idea to double up your rooks like this and what's good about this is that the doubled rooks are not on the same color.  Because Jack also said that it's not a good idea to bring your rooks on the same colored square.
235,9,32,2Rc7,b'1r4k1/1pr2pp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP3P2/2KRR3 w - -',! Good choice.  Black decides to avoid exchanging R's with this move.  I like it because in general when you're behind it's not a good idea to exchange as it would give you less to defend with in the endgame.
236,9,33,2Re2,b'1r4k1/1pr2pp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP2RP2/2KR4 b - -',At first I wasn't sure why but quickly figured it out.  The idea behind this move is combine both rooks on one file.  Jack also mentioned that it's usually a good idea to do that because it's what makes doubled rooks powerful and dangerous against the opponent because they generally pose very serious threats that are not easy to deal with.
237,9,34,2Kh8,b'1r5k/1pr2pp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP2RP2/2KR4 w - -',In my mind this move was pointless.  I believe that black was worried about a dangerous check with the E rook LSB and the remaining N.  But what he forgot is that his LSB defends against it.  
238,9,35,2Rde1,b'1r5k/1pr2pp1/p5b1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 b - -',In the meantime Gerhard has now united his R's as noted earlier.  And as it turns out they pose a very serious threat that black has to worry about.  And if he's not careful white will be able to mate him.
239,9,36,2f6,b'1r5k/1pr3p1/p4pb1/n1pB2N1/6P1/2P4P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 w - -',"!! Very good choice which shows that black was thinking ahead.  Had he not seen this it would have been game over by exchanging R's with 26.R2e8+!! 26...Rxe8 27.Rxe8#  However black is not out of the woods and ""he better be careful from now on"".  Otherwise white will be able to force a win."
240,9,37,2Nf3,b'1r5k/1pr3p1/p4pb1/n1pB4/6P1/2P2N1P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 b - -',In the meantime white's not taking any chances either.  He knew that leaving his N on g5 would leave it en-prise and that black would win it after 26...PXN.
241,9,38,2b5,b'1r5k/2r3p1/p4pb1/nppB4/6P1/2P2N1P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 w - b6',?? I don't know why black played this.  But this is his losing blunder.  Despite being behind best was to force an exchange with 26...Be4.  With this move however white will either win a free piece or find a mating pattern in which black will not be able to avoid this time. 
242,9,39,2Nh4,b'1r5k/2r3p1/p4pb1/nppB4/6PN/2P4P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 b - -',Very smart choice.  White's intention is to force mate or win a free piece.  What doesn't realize is that koki could have done both.  How?
243,9,40,2Bd3,b'1r5k/2r3p1/p4p2/nppB4/6PN/2Pb3P/PP2RP2/2K1R3 w - -',?? Now it's all over and there's no going back this time.  Yes he did protected his LSB by attacking white's R.  The idea was to gain tempii  Unfortunately for black however this move seals his fate.  That's because in the next few moves it will lead to an inevitable mating sequence.  It actually starts when white actually gains tempo with his next move.  So in short koki missed the real threat.  
244,9,41,Bc4,b'1r5k/2r3p1/p4p2/nppB4/2b3PN/2P1R2P/PP3P2/2K1R3 w - -',Black is trying to force an exchange but instead of allowing it white can now play the move that I talked about earlier.  And that's the move that seals black fate once and for all.
245,9,42,Rxe8,b'4r2k/2r3p1/p4p2/nppB4/2b3PN/2P4P/PP3P2/2K1R3 w - -',As I expected.  Yes it does prevent the loss of a R but no matter what black does white has a forced win.
246,9,43,3Rxe8+,b'4R2k/2r3p1/p4p2/nppB4/2b3PN/2P4P/PP3P2/2K5 b - -',The obvious response.

251,9,48,3Bc2,b'8/2r3p1/p4p2/npp4R/2b2kPN/2P4P/PPB2P2/2K5 b - -',!! This move protects his LSB.  But this time it's not just good it's extraordinarily brilliant worthy of two exclamation points as opposed to one.  And that's because white's LSB will be used as an extra piece to coordinate the mating pattern which is going to unfold soon.
252,9,49,3Bxa2,b'8/2r3p1/p4p2/npp4R/5kPN/2P4P/bPB2P2/2K5 w - -',Well given that white is going to mate black has nothing better to do then take.  The idea being is that no move is better then the other in this case.  Therefore I would've resigned at this point if I were black because of what's going to come on the next move.

In researching the internet I found that the stronger side can rarely win but that the best move for both sides is sometimes far from obvious. So of course I was anxious to feed this into the GK analyzer (the only computer program I have available) to see if it could find better moves in the ending.

296,11,8,2Nd3,b'r4rk1/1ppqbp1p/p1n2n2/2Pp2p1/3P2P1/P1NN1P2/1P1Q3P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',The computer passed this over without comment. Nh3 seems interesting e.g. h6 21. Nxg5 Nxg4 22. Nh3 Ne3 23. Nf4 Bf6 24. Rxe3 Bxd4. I may well be missing something here.
297,11,9,2Ne5,b'r4rk1/1ppqbp1p/p4n2/2PpN1p1/3n2P1/P1N2P2/1P1Q3P/R1B1R1K1 b - -',The text wins a piece but at the cost of too many pawns. The computer likes Qxg5 better.
298,11,10,2Bh6,b'r4rk1/1p3p1p/p1p2n1B/2bp4/6pN/P1N5/1P4KP/R3R3 b - -',Again driving the Rook where it wants to go! The computer gives Bg5
299,11,11,3Rf1,b'4r1k1/1p3p1p/p1p2n2/2bp2B1/6pN/P1N5/1P4KP/5R2 b - -',The computer thinks that White should have exchanged Rooks. I am not totally convinced.
300,11,12,Re5,b'5bk1/1p3p1p/p1p5/3pr1B1/6p1/P5N1/1P4KP/5R2 w - -',Now it is Black's turn to return the favor by driving the Bishop where it wants to go! According to the computer Black retains a slight advantage by ... Re6 but after this move White is better.
301,11,13,h5,b'8/1p3pk1/p1p1r3/3p3p/5RN1/P7/1P4KP/8 w - h6',In this way Black obtains the 7th rank. On an immediate ... Re2+ White plays Rf2.
302,11,14,4h4,b'8/1p6/p1p2pk1/3p3p/1P5P/P4RK1/2r2N2/8 b - h3',This seemed wrong to me at the time but it's actually quite good. It virtually ensures that White will eventually win Black's h pawn.
303,11,15,b6,b'8/8/ppp2pk1/3p3p/1Pr4P/P2N1RK1/8/8 w - -',The computer didn't like this naturally looking move. On the contrary I think it worked out pretty well.
304,11,16,a5,b'8/8/1pp2p1k/p2p3p/1Pr2N1P/P3R1K1/8/8 w - -',Black needs to exchange as many pawns as possible.
305,11,17,5Rxb6,b'8/7k/1R6/7N/1p1p3P/r7/5K2/8 b - -',After the mayhem Black has only one pawn for the Knight. But he only has to eliminate one White pawn to achieve his goal!
306,11,18,5Kg2,b'5k2/1R6/5N2/7P/3p4/1p5r/6K1/8 b - -',At the time I thought this might be a blunder. However the computer passed it over without comment. It seems that Black will achieve a draw regardless.
307,11,19,5Rxb3,b'5k2/8/5N2/7P/8/1R1p3r/6K1/8 b - -',After playing quite quickly for a number of moves White suddenly paused before playing this move. Perhaps he did not see that the rook is poisoned?
308,11,20,6Ne4,b'8/6k1/8/7P/4N3/3r4/3p2K1/3R4 b - -',The computer likes Ng4 better but in the line it gives Black eliminates the pawn anyway and achieves a draw.
309,11,21,Kxh5,b'8/8/8/7k/8/3r4/3N2K1/3R4 w - -',Whew! Mission accomplished!
310,11,22,Kg4,b'8/8/8/8/6k1/3r4/3N1K2/3R4 w - -',Since Black's King is out of the corner and there are no Knight forks in sight the draw is not that complicated. Black's strategy is to keep the Rook far from his King to avoid any forks and harass the White King with checks.
311,11,23,6Ke2,b'8/8/8/8/6k1/3r4/3NK3/3R4 b - -',In the ensuing struggle the computer finds no inaccuracies on either side. Do you agree?
312,11,24,8Rh7+,b'8/3k3R/8/5K2/5N2/8/8/5r2 b - -',With this White calls it a day and offers a draw.
313,12,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Nick (moistcomrade) had previously played two games against sabyyavin for which he lost both because he cracked under the pressure of being behind in material. Nick already drops a rook early and whilst most players would have given up Nick gallantly fought on and against the material deficit generated a strong attack. Black still maintains a material advantage after the exchange of queens but makes a costly blunder and White queens his pawn. Even with accurate defence Black could have drawn the game but he ends up dropping a rook at the end and concedes. 
314,12,1,c4,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qpb2/2P5/5N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQR1K1 b - c3',Probably a weakening move; 9. d3 is stronger.

317,12,4,1g3,b'2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/8/2P1R3/1Q1P2P1/PB1q1P1P/6K1 b - -',White is trying to free the back rank for his king but Black has no immediate mate threats. 19. Re3 is better guarding the d3 pawn. 
318,12,5,1Bc5,b'2kr3r/ppp2ppp/8/2b5/2P1R3/1Q1P2P1/PB1q1P1P/6K1 w - -',Even so taking immediately would have been better.

320,12,7,Qb1,b'k2bR3/pp1r1p1p/2p2B2/5Q2/2P5/3r2P1/P4PKP/1q6 w - -',Black is threatening Rxg3+ because of the pin but he failed to realise 30. Bxd8! Rxg3+ 31. Kxg3 Qxf5?? 32. Bc7+ mates. 
321,12,8,3g4,b'k2bR3/pp1r1p1p/2p2B2/5Q2/2P3P1/3r4/P4PKP/1q6 b - -',Unfortunately White missed the capture. 
322,12,9,3Be7,b'k2bR3/pp1rBp1p/2p5/5Q2/2P3P1/3r4/q4PKP/8 b - -',White should have captured. He is hoping for 31...Rxe7?? 32. Qc8# but Black sees through right his trap. 
323,12,10,3Qxc4,b'k2bR3/pp1rBp1p/2p5/5Q2/2q3P1/3r4/5PKP/8 w - -',31...Qe2 is better. Black would have maintained his rook advantage. Still Black remains material up.
324,12,11,Rd2xd5,b'4R3/pk1r1p1p/2p2B2/1p1r4/6P1/5PK1/7P/8 w - -',Nick is down the exchange and a few pawns but puts his faith in the passed pawns. 
325,12,12,Rd5d2,b'8/pk1r1p1R/2p2B2/8/6PP/1p3PK1/3r4/8 w - -',a slight error; maybe 39...a5 pushing the pawns was better. 
326,12,13,Kc7,b'8/p1kr1p1R/2p2B2/6P1/7P/1p3PK1/3r4/8 w - -',again 40...a5 was better. White's passed pawn on the h-file is very difficult to stop.
327,12,14,Rbd2,b'7R/pk1r1p2/2p4P/6P1/8/5PK1/3r4/8 w - -',Black's advantage is now minimal and White will queen his pawn. Significantly better was 45...Rb1! where Black will be able to get behind the pawn. After a long variation Black will take the passed pawn and push home his material advantage. 
328,12,15,f6,b'7R/pk1r3P/2p2p2/6P1/8/5PK1/3r4/8 w - -',Again 46...Rd1 would have been better. For the first time in the game White has the advantage courtesy of Computer Analysis @ Gameknot.
329,12,16,4Rb8+,b'1R6/pk1r3P/2p2p2/6P1/8/5PK1/3r4/8 b - -',Maybe 47. g6 first creating another passed pawn? Then 47...R2d5 48. Rb8+ Kxb8 49. h8=Q+ Kb7 50. Kh3 Ka6 51. Qxf6 keeps material close to level with good drawing chances for Black.
330,12,17,Rd2d6,b'8/p1kr4/2pr1Q2/6P1/8/5PK1/8/8 w - -',49....a5 gives better chances.

333,12,20,5Rg8,b'6r1/pk1r4/2p3P1/8/5PK1/8/2Q5/8 w - -',And Black falls for the trap on a similar variation; 56...Rd2 gives White a small advantage but nothing immediate. 
334,12,21,5Qb3+,b'6r1/pk1r4/2p3P1/8/5PK1/1Q6/8/8 b - -',And so Black gave up. Incredible that White fought on after dropping a rook and worked his way back into the match and when Black drops a rook he resigns. Incredible game!

489,19,0,d4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3',"Hi everyone!

This game started off as a Dutch Defense in a thematic mini-tournament.  This resulted in closed positional play right until the latter part of the middlegame where I managed to win a pawn and go into an endgame with a pawn up.  You would think this ought to have been a straightforward win wouldn't you?  Well not quite - let's throw some opposite coloured bishops into the mix and things were not as straightforward as they seemed even when I increased the advantage to that of two pawns the graffiti on my wall was reading ""Low Draw"".  However before hitting that Offer Draw button I decided to have one last throw of the dice but did it pay off?  Well in order to find out you will have to read on ......"
490,19,1,f5,b'rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq f6',1. ..... f5 - this is the Dutch Defense and I have had mixed results with this opening.  It looks as though I will be leaving Henry exposed on the Fool's Mate diagonal but in order for my opponent to plonk the Wicked Witch of the West on the h5 square it is not as simple as it first seems.
491,19,2,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pp2p2p/2p3p1/3p1p2/3P1B2/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',4. ..... g6 - this position is getting to be a little stonewallesque.  It sometimes leaves me really stuck for ideas and this is how I end up getting bogged down in the middle game.
492,19,3,Bg7,b'r1bqk1nr/pp1np1bp/2p3p1/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',6. ...... Bg7 - I complete the kingside fianchetto and the Fool's Mate diagonal is firmly closed off.
493,19,4,Nf7,b'r1bqk2r/pp1npnbp/2p3p1/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NBPN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',8. ..... Nf7 - not much happening.

495,19,6,Nxe5,b'r1bqk2r/pp4bp/2p3p1/3pnp2/1P3B2/2NBP2P/P1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',11. ...... Nxe5 - followed by a plethora of exchanges.

497,19,8,b6,b'r2q1rk1/p4nbp/1pp1b1p1/3p1p2/NP3B2/4P2P/P1PQBPP1/1R3RK1 w - -',15. ..... b6 - even with those exchanges I seem to be in a defensive mode.

500,19,11,Bxe5,b'3rr1k1/p3q2p/1pp1b1p1/3pbp2/1P6/P1P1P2P/1N1QBPP1/1R1R2K1 w - -',20. ..... Bxe5 - B for N exchange.  Nice to keep the bishop pair.
501,19,12,Bf7,b'3rr1k1/p3qbbp/1pp3p1/3p1p2/1P3P2/P1P1P2P/1N2B1P1/1R1RQ1K1 w - -',22. ..... Bf7 - one move ago white played the seemingly strong f4.  However this has left Roger with a backward e pawn and now I sneakily discover an attack on it.  Glenda is getting her broomstick ready ......
502,19,13,Re6,b'4r1k1/p3qbbp/1pp1r1p1/3p1p2/1P3P2/P1PRPB1P/1N4P1/1R2Q1K1 w - -',24. ..... Re6 - pile on.

516,19,27,d4,b'8/p6p/2p1rk2/1p3p2/1P1p1P2/P2BbK1P/2R5/8 w - -',46. ..... d4 - protecting Fou Lenoir and blocking off the e file but I am still saddled with vulnerable pawns!
517,19,28,Bc1,b'8/p6p/2p1rk2/1pR2p2/1P1p1P2/P2B1K1P/8/2b5 w - -',47. ..... Bc1 - my poor little f5 pawn is now a gonner.  However Fou Lenoir goes for the white queenside pawns.
518,19,29,5fxe5,b'8/p3k2p/2p5/1p2P3/1P1p4/P2B1K1P/8/2b5 b - -',50. fxe5 - now the rooks have been traded off and it really is an opposite colour bishop ending.  I decided to let the pawn on a7 go for the pawns on a3 and b4 and regain my two pawn advantage.  However it does allow white to get a passed pawn.  The alternative was to play a6 but then Roger could always play Be4 and then my queenside pawns could fall.  So I decided Bxa3 to be the lesser of the two evils.
519,19,30,Bxb4,b'8/p3k2B/2p5/1p2P3/1b1p4/5K1P/8/8 w - -',51. .... Bxb4 - at least I have no less than FOUR passers on the queenside.  However will any of them reach Glendadom?  We shall see!
520,19,31,a5,b'8/4k2B/2p5/pp2P3/1b1p3P/5K2/8/8 w - a6',52. ..... a5 - I can only try.
521,19,32,5Ke4,b'8/4k2B/2p5/pp2P2P/3pK3/8/3b4/8 b - -',54. Ke4 - centralising his king and going for the d5 pawn.  Fou Lenoir tries to protect it but finds himself on the next turn overloaded.
522,19,33,Bxh6,b'8/4k3/2p4b/1p2PB2/p2pK3/8/8/8 w - -',56. ..... Bxh6 - forced.
523,19,34,a3,b'8/4k3/2p4b/1p2PB2/3K4/p7/8/8 w - -',57. .... a3 - just two more squares.
524,19,35,Bg7,b'8/4k1b1/2p5/1p2P3/3K4/p7/8/1B6 w - -',58. ... Bg7 - my last throw of the dice - a pin!
525,19,36,6Ke4,b'8/3k2b1/2p5/1p2P3/4K3/p7/B7/8 b - -',60. Ke4?? - I think this is the loser.  Next move I play my winner - c5!
526,19,37,c4,b'8/4k1b1/4P3/1p1K4/2p5/p7/B7/8 w - -',62. ..... c4 - the vital a2-g8 diagonal is now blocked.
527,19,38,Kxe6,b'8/6b1/4k3/1p6/2p1K3/p7/B7/8 w - -',"63. .... Kxe6 - Henry snaps off Roger's final pawn and now three pawns down Roger decides to hit the resign button.  Here are his post game comments: ""In my white game disregarding the computer analysis the move I thought lost it for me was #53. Instead of h5 I should have moved my K to Ke2. This would have stopped you B from guarding the diagonal including h6 for my advancing pawn. Of course being several pawns down was a killer in end game"". He will not be able to stop Glenda from appearing on either c1 or a1.  That's all for now folks but I will be back with another endgame where I have had to deal with stubborn resistance in a rook ending from a Class C Player by the name of Dan.  Until then have a good read and a nice weekend - Kind regards - Joanne"

533,20,5,Nc6,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2P1P2n/8/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ -',The situation: black will capture on e5 obtaining a dominating position in the centre. moreover one cannot recommend a flank for the safety of the white king. not to mention the double pawns on the c file and the large black majority on the kingside. this is close to winning for black.

536,20,8,1bxc3,b'r4rk1/pp2pp1p/4b1p1/2P4n/8/P1PBB3/2P3PP/2KR3R b - -',now 3=1. only the pair of bishops and the somewhat untidy play of the opponent enabled white  to survive a bit more.
537,20,9,Bd5,b'r4rk1/pp2pp1p/5np1/2Pb4/3B4/P1PB4/2P3PP/2KR3R w - -',a bit too clever. going after the c pawns would have been better. now white has some chances to create countarplay

539,20,11,2Rg1,b'3r2k1/pp3p1p/6p1/2Pn4/3B4/P1PB4/2P3bP/2K3R1 b - -',inaccurate. white missed the sequence that follows.

542,20,14,2Bh3,b'6k1/pp3p1p/6p1/2P1B3/8/P1P2r1b/2P4P/2K3R1 w - -',black returns the favor. Rf5 is almost like money in the bank.
543,20,15,Be6,b'8/pp3k1p/3Rbpp1/2P5/3B4/P1P2r2/2P4P/2K5 w - -',a mistake. black actually need the bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal. now the game becomes unbalanced. however in zeitnot white will not be able to keep up with the pace of the pawn race that will star soon after the next couple of moves.

Having split points with players in second and 3rd position players my final game against 4th position player in mini tournament was must win game for me to retain first place. I was cursing myself for having led to (over analysed) variation of Sicilian defense. I was not willing to settle for a draw hence had to play some sharp variation. But with his last move I had some thoughts. Why this move is not there in book moves of Sicilian. Every where it is Nf6. I thought for a long time and played .....

652,25,2,Qb8,b'rqb1kb1r/1p1pnppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq -',As said earlier Qb6 is better but not fatal.

654,25,4,g6,b'rqb1kb1N/1p1pn2p/2n1p1p1/8/4P3/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Any other move here and I play Bh5+. Even now I had strong desire to play 13. Bh5  Bg7  ( 13..... g*h5  14. Q*h5 followed by Q*h7 saving N. One piece anyway I have to loose. ) 14. N*g6  h*g6  15. Qg5 but fails to 15. .... Kf7. & my B is stuck. I was also pondering to play Bd3 opening diagonal for Q but had no decisive attack. So decided to bring R into play. 
655,25,5,1f5,b'rqb1k2N/1p1pn1bp/2n1p1p1/5P2/4P3/8/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - -',I was wondering if I should take his pawn first with 14 N*g3  h*g3 than just giving N for free. But I was loosing a tempo which is so critical in sharp variation. Here if 14. ... B*N  15. f6 Now N dose not have any place to move and I win a piece. e.g. 15 ... Ng8  16. f7+ winning N.
656,25,6,1exf5,b'rqb1k2N/1p1pn1bp/2n3p1/5p2/4P3/8/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - -',Now king which can't be castled is more open. N again does not have any place to go.

Kh1  Nfe7 22. Rf8+  Kc7  23. Bf4  Be5  24. B*e5  N*e5. Then win game with 2 pawn up. This was as - in my analysis I was worried that Q was attacked by N on move 21 and was moving my Q instead of Rf8+. Also I was worried of black having 2 N for my R as both Q were on board.
658,25,8,1Rxf5,b'rqb1k2b/1p1p3p/2n2Pp1/5R2/8/8/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ2K1 b - -',His N is developed. I gave up exchange for opening diagonal for white from h5 to e8. If he does take R then I simply retreat and win game on material advantage.

661,25,11,Bxf6,b'r1bk4/qp1p3p/2n2b2/5pBB/8/8/PPP3PP/R2Q3K w - -',Black had to give his B as 20. ... Qc5  21. f7+ Kc7  22. Bh3 winning Q
662,25,12,Kc7,b'r1b5/qpkp3p/2n2B2/5p1B/8/8/PPP3PP/R2Q3K w - -',Now I was actually pawn up. Till now it was only a flamboyant attack. All that attack was only for a pawn? Well! Credit has to be given to black for defending well. But black king is on queen side and my bishops are on Kind side and his pawn structure is disturbed which was good for me. The way forward I felt was by advancing pawns. So I continued 
663,25,13,2c3,b'r1b5/qpkp3p/2n2B2/5p1B/8/2P5/PP4PP/R2Q3K b - -',Now his B can't move R dose not have good place to move N dose not have good place to move. and 22. ... Kb8 23. Qd6 #. So only Q and pawns can move. 
664,25,14,2Qe3,b'r1b5/1pkp3p/2n2B2/5p1B/8/2P1q3/PP4PP/R2Q3K w - -',This is a good move. I had not analysed this move. He controls e file and gives last rank threat. Also controls black squire where his king is. My plan of playing b4 followed by b5 removing N and then playing Be5+ had to be given re thinking. If my Q goes on attack then  my both B are hanging which could be fatal.
665,25,15,2Bd4,b'r1b5/1pkp3p/2n5/5p1B/3B4/2P1q3/PP4PP/R2Q3K b - -',So I decided to give up my B for his N and opening c file for R.
666,25,16,b6,b'r1b5/2kp3p/1p6/5p1B/3P4/4q3/PP4PP/R2Q3K w - -',Desperately trying for safety of king with some counter attack with B diagonal. 
667,25,17,Kd8,b'r1bk4/3p3p/1p6/5p1B/3P4/4q3/PP4PP/2RQ3K w - -',Cant play 25. ... Kb8  26. Qc2  Bb7 (to save B) 27. Qc7+  Ka7  28. Bf3  Rb8  and white has a very comfortable position. 
668,25,18,2Rc3,b'r1bk4/3p3p/1p6/5p1B/3P4/2R1q3/PP4PP/3Q3K b - -',Now if 26. ... Qf4 27. Qd1 with winning attack. He has to choose between keeping D column or black squire file of c1 to h3. He chose latter.
669,25,19,2Qg5,b'r1bk4/3p3p/1p6/5pqB/3P4/2R5/PP4PP/3Q3K w - -',Leaving d file open but 27. Qd2  Qg1 28. Rg3 Qe3 has reasonable defense. He is controlling black squires and if I am to give check with my Q then I need control of black squires. So I had to draw away his queen.
670,25,20,Qf4,b'r1bk4/3p3p/1p6/5p1B/3P1q2/6R1/PP4PP/3Q3K w - -',Qh3 would have been better keeping pressure on my B. But there is no direct forced mate besides last row threat he is also threatening to kill my pawn at a2. Playing a3 and h3 will waste lot of time and he has opportunity to develop. So I decided to bring my pawn in attack. 
671,25,21,d6,b'r1bk4/7p/1p1p4/3P1p1B/5q2/6R1/PP4PP/3Q3K w - -',To stop d6. if 28. ...  Kc7  29. d6+ Q*d6  30. Rc3+. Now I don't have any winning attack but just to try my luck I played

673,25,23,3Rg3+,b'2b5/7p/1p1p4/3P1p2/2Q2q2/4k1R1/PP2B1PP/7K b - -',Here he resigned as Q cant be saved. Hope you enjoyed the game.

I initially was impressed with this opening but I have not liked the results. Perhaps I should study more master games with Be7 and d6 - I'm not optimistic however. There are several problems:

(1) The weakness on f4 - A solid strong loyal companion in both the Leningrad and Stonewall varaitions mr. f is virtually alone in the classical - protected only by mr. e whose job in the other two variations is shielding the king from diagonal checks. I can play Kh8 but it wastes time and doesn't solve the problem of being forced to take *out* of the center and open the e file (rather than the d file which is what the Dutch naturally prefers). Another option is using mr. g to protect it (like in the Leningrad) but if I play g6 I want to play Bg7!

(2) The e7 bishop is AWFUL - look at it! It lacks a legal move!! There's not a 'good' bishop and a 'bad' one (like there is in both other variations) there are TWO bad bishops...it's hard to figure out which one is worse!

At the end of the day this is the reason people don't play the Dutch - king safety problems a weak overextended mr. f and a cramped position that keeps your bishops home. You're grabbing space but doing nothing with it!

Leningrad and Stonewall have both made me proud - let's go back to them!"

(!) e5 is a famous hole in the Dutch defense - it's been the infiltration square for my position on numerous occasions and if my opponent can win this square (though the classical fights for it very effectively) they may also win the day.

I have been trying to find a game to annotate which involved yours truly and a fellow Bigpeta Club member.  I think it may be best to fish out one of my games with Coach Ion which I did not get round to annotate.  Sadly it was not one of my best efforts against The Coach and indeed I was absolutely steamrollered!  However it does have some interest value because the guy who ran this mini-tournament was Freddy the Master Mater.  Freddy just lurves to play unusual openings and this is one of his experiments.

I spent some time working out how best to deal with this as it's a bit of a nuisance pinning my N against my Q if the e-pawn makes its normal advance.  In the past I've moved the Q to e8 to avoid the pin but in this game I decided that the N wanted to use e8.  For a while I got a rather cramped looking position but it proved a solid launch pad for a strong counter-attack.

If black chooses 1.d4 lines would be either much aggressive or much closed. With time control one should need very high strategic powers and accuracy to play latter lines.
790,31,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',And there's my favorite response for a quick game. IMO one of those best responses for 1.e4.

806,31,17,Ke8,b'rnb1kbnr/ppp1qNp1/7p/5Q2/3PP3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',It would be a rapid try to attack the queen capture the horse and save the hanging rook on h8.

810,31,21,1Nc6,b'r4bnr/pQp1qkp1/2n4p/8/3PP3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',And there the white queen is in dilemma. The rook or the knight as both were complementary material.
811,31,22,1Qxc6,b'r4bnr/p1p1qkp1/2Q4p/8/3PP3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R b KQ -',Avoiding from thinking twice the knoght was the selected target. If the rook was captured the e pawn was en prise and the game would go as 12.Qxa8 Qxe4+ 13.Kd1 Qxd4+ 14.Bd2 Qd7. In this case the material looks alike as taking the knight besides the queen is cornered on a8 and need a couple of more moves for 'reactivation'.
812,31,23,1Rd8,b'3r1bnr/p1p1qkp1/2Q4p/8/3PP3/8/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R w KQ -',A desperate attempt to save the rook and to create some threat.

889,36,5,Ng3,b'r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2N3NP/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So this is his plan. The e pawn is protected by his Ng3 so he can play Nc3-d5 and he can also play Bc1-e3 without fear of me playing Nf6-g4 in reply. The downside is that he has wasted so many moves with his knight now at g3. Black is ahead in development.
890,36,6,O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2N3NP/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ -',So I continue to develop

Here is the first of two endgames from a new sparring partner called Dan.  He is a Class C player but with his stats - he has only lost 3 games out of 6 against me - he can start looking up towards Class B status.  I will now show you a couple of games against him in Chicoboy's Club's Mini-Tournament.  My score against him was 1.5 - 0.5 in my favour.  This is the game in which I was to concede a Low Draw in a K & P ending.  So how did this happen?  Well I end up trying out the Philidor Defense against him.  Surprisingly when I have played it I have done pretty well with it and one of those victories was my first ever Class A victory when I had a Class C rating - so I thought I would try it.  Here is how it all panned out.  Dan opens with 1. e4."
979,38,1,d6,b'rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',2. ..... d6 - this move is the Philidor Defense named after Andre Danican Philidor who first played this move in a serious tournament.  It's one drawback is that it shuts in Fou Lenoir.

I really can't seem to resist the habit to trade queens.  Over the past few years I have managed to trust in Glenda a bit more but sometimes I do tend to lapse into those bad habits of inappropriate exchanges and passivitis!
988,38,10,Rxf8,b'5rk1/p5pp/1pppp3/8/4P3/P2P3P/1PP3P1/R5K1 w - -',22. ..... Rxf8 - after this plethora of exchanges Gameknot Analysis indicates the position as dead level.  Dan and I continue to trade.
989,38,11,2Kxf1,b'6k1/p5pp/1pppp3/8/4P3/P2P3P/1PP3P1/5K2 b - -',24. Kxf1 - and it brings King Dan one step closer to centralisation.  I must now follow suit with Henry.

994,38,16,h6,b'8/8/2k4p/p2p2p1/P2P2P1/2K4P/8/8 w - -',37. ..... h6 - the queenside is completely locked.  Can I try something on the kingside?  We shall see.
995,38,17,Kf6,b'8/8/5k1p/p2p2p1/P2P2P1/5K1P/8/8 w - -',42. .... Kf6- I decided that there was no mileage out of h5 and the writing is now firmly on my Facebook Wall - LOW DRAW!  I take nothing away from Dan here in the entire 43 moves played he made NO ERRORS whatsoever and I made one inaccuracy - so Dan's performance is epic utterly epic although I was certainly loathe to concede 9 rating points Dan deserved every one of them.  So I ended up hitting the offer draw button and Dan accepted.  Thankfully in my return match things worked out much better for me but not without a fight.  That game will be annotated sometime this week.  Until then bye for now - Joanne
