An important point is that B played 1...e6 preventing a move like .....Bg4.  This choice creates a ""bad bishop"" for B later similar to many variations of the French Defense.  It is not a bad choice but it dictates some rock-ribbed behavior by B to get through to the early middle-game with normally good prospects. "

6. e3  I seriously considered 6. e4 to command the center.  But that is B's intention anyway and I had decided first to counter-balance B's Q-side pressure.  And getting in my early 5. a4 guarantees that good counter-balance and an eventual recovery of the c-Pawn."
4,0,4,1b3,b'rnbqk2r/p4ppp/4pn2/1p6/2pP4/1PB1PN2/5PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq -',10. b3  All book to this point.  But now we start to stray from the main lines.  My counter-balance operation is in progress now.  There is no hint yet that the game will shift quickly to the the K-side and later the center.
5,0,5,O-O,b'rnb2rk1/p4ppp/3qpn2/B3N3/2pP4/4P3/5PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',13....O-O  B's Q-side is obviously open terrain so this is the only move to give B's King any sanctuary.  But now what will W do with his own Queen and King?  It is hard to believe that they do not move during this entire game!   In fact to do so from this point on only serves to slow down the action W's minor pieces are causing!
6,0,6,Qd5,b'rnb2rk1/p4ppp/4pn2/B2q4/2NP4/4P3/5PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',14....Qd5.  We are commencing a fascinating phase of the game.  First observe that the control of the a8-h1 diagonal will begin to dominate the game.  This is the ongoing counter-balance strategy I have started.  But secondly also observe that B has activated his Queen and can soon activate his Q-side minor pieces to do some serious damage to W's King.  How do these two strategies play out against each other?
7,0,7,1Be2,b'rnb2rk1/p4ppp/4pn2/B2q4/2NP4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',15. Be2  Is that tempting K-side Knight Pawn worth yielding the a8-h1 diagonal? That is the question I posed to B in effect.
8,0,8,1Nc6,b'r1b2rk1/p4ppp/2n1pn2/B2q4/2NP4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',15....Nc6.  I considered he might try 15....Ba6 attacking the Knight.  I was considering 16. Bf3 if he made that move.
9,0,9,1Bc7,b'r1b2rk1/p1B2ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/2NP4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',16. Bc7.   Of course! This freezes B's Rooks and commands the b8-a2 diagonal.  Both Bishops will soon be commanding the board.
10,0,10,1Bd7,b'r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/2NP4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',16....Bd7.  B did not apparently consider 16...Bb7 maybe because some variations seem to leave that bishop hanging undefended on that a8-h1 diagonal depending upon how the N/c6 moves.   Once W moves Bf3 the diagonal belongs to W.  It was possibly worth looking at 16....e5 for B even though it costs a Pawn because it really frees up his pieces and gives his a-Pawn more support if it can make it to a5.  But the timing is important.  Can he do that knowing that Bf3 is looming?
11,0,11,1Nd6,b'r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2nNpn2/3q4/3P4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ -',17. Nd6  This retains the lock on B's Rooks and continues the invitation to B's Queen to stray into the K-side and of course take another Pawn!
12,0,12,Qg5,b'r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2nNpn2/6q1/3P4/4PB2/5P1P/R2QK2R w KQ -',18...Qg5  From this point on I begin an active hunt for the B Queen.  Can I prevent her from escaping to her Q-side and trap her on the K-side?
13,0,13,2Nc4,b'r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2n1pn1q/8/2NP3P/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',20. Nc4.  The Knight can leave its e6 post as long as the B Queen is not on the fifth rank; otherwise she escapes her confinement.  But in this position she is on the sixth rank.  And by moving the Knight I am able to use the Q's Bishop on c7 to harass the B Queen.  As a reminder my own Q is completely out of play.  She is not needed!  This is still a very dynamic position.  For example even though the B Queen is on the sixth rank and seemingly confined with a properly timed ....e5 she can escape from the area of h6.
14,0,14,2Nd5,b'r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2n1p2q/3n4/2NP3P/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',20....Nd5.  I thought he could try 20...Rfc8 21. Bf4 followed by 22. Ne6 or 22. Ke2 making Rg1 possible.
15,0,15,Nde7,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2n1p2q/8/2NP3P/4PBB1/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',21... Nde7  B does not have many choices as W's dominance on the a8-h1 diagonal is significant.  The choices are to release the Q Rook from behind that pin by the W King's Bishop but give up that isolated Pawn on a7.  That Pawn is often a winner for B in many variations where B is successful in launching a Q-side attack.  But here it is totally stalled. So the only other choice for B is to reinforce the Knight at c6 and maintain the block on that diagonal.  What will give first?
16,0,16,2Bf4,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2n1p2q/8/2NP1B1P/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',24.  Bf4.  Of course!
17,0,17,Qf5,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2n1p3/5q1P/2NP1B2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R w KQ -',23....Qf6 is bad due to 24. Ne5 threatening 25. Be4 and 26. Ng4 finally trapping the Queen.  In this line 24....Nxe5? provokes 25. de attacking Queen and Bishop.  This becomes a real shooting gallery for W against B.
18,0,18,2Nd6,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2nNp3/5q1P/3P1B2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',24. Nd6.  Still aiming to trap the Queen!  Notice the sweeping firepower of W's two Bishops and Knight.  And soon the Rook will start to train on the K-side.  In this position W's Queen seems superfluous aside from supporting the a8-h1 diagonal pin!  A very odd position a type I have never played before.
19,0,19,2Ne4,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2n1pq2/7P/3PNB2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK2R b KQ -',25. Ne4.  I thought long and hard about this move as it blocks the big diagonal and gives B more breathing room.  But the goal is still the B Queen if I can snag it.  
20,0,20,2Rg1,b'r4rk1/p2bnppp/2n1p3/5q1P/3PNB2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK1R1 b Q -',26. Rg1.  Here is the defining moment.  Can B afford the time to free his Queen with Qb5?  It certainly allows the Queen the escape valve she needs plus maybe one or two spite checks on the W King.  But I wanted to allow that finally because I had some serious fire-power trained on B's King-side now.  B's King looks very vulnerable between the Rook h-Pawn and all the minor pieces aiming at that corner.
21,0,21,2g6,b'r4rk1/p2bnp1p/2n1p1p1/5q1P/3PNB2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK1R1 w Q -',26....g6.  Moving his Queen anywhere along the fifth rank causes instant ruination starting with 27. Nf6+.  Now he must decide how to give up his Queenstarting now.
22,0,22,2Rg5,b'r4rk1/p2bnp1p/2n1p1p1/5qRP/3PNB2/4PB2/5P2/R2QK3 b Q -',27. Rg5.  The hunt is on!

26,0,26,3d5,b'r4rk1/p2b3p/2n1p1p1/3P1nN1/8/4P1B1/5PB1/R2QK3 b Q -',32. d5 Some unfathomable results now.  This move forces open either or both of the big diagonals and B has no good reply.  If he had been able to return his Knight to e7 first he would still have 32. d5 to contend with and play 32.....Nxd5 33. Bxd5 ed (33....Nb4 does nothing) 34. Qxd5+ and B loses the Bishop plus control of the seventh rank. 
27,0,27,3c7,b'r1b2rk1/p1P4p/4p1p1/6N1/8/4P1n1/5PB1/R2QK3 b Q -',"Ruinous losses are pending now with a legitimate threat by W to force entry onto the seventh rank.  Once that occurs  B's King is toast.  Even with 34....Nf5 35. Bxa8 (this threat was hanging all game and only now comes into play) followed by Rxa7 and Ra8 or more directly by Qd8!
A very hard-fought game with solid positional issues to work through for both sides."

45,2,0,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',"Jacques Mieses was born on February 23 1865 -- just a few years after Morphy's brilliant conquest of England and Europe. No doubt the games of Morphy exercised a strong influence on Mieses's style for in his long career he won a staggering number of brilliancy prizes. Mieses was born in Leipzig and studied first at Leipzig University and later in Berlin. His international success did not come until 1888 when he tied for 2nd place at Nuremberg and took 3rd at Leipzig. Over the next 50 years he played in numerous tournaments always with an eye to the sharpest openings and boldest sacrifices. He also had the practice of earning money by writing journalistic reports about the tournaments in which he was playing which may have contributed to his erratic results. In 1907 He came in 1st at Vienna ahead of Duras Maroczy Tartakover Vidmar Schlechter and Spielmann -- yet later that year he had a dismal performance at Carlsbad. He fled Germany just before World War II and eventually became a naturalized British citizen. He had a sharp wit even in old age. On the occasion of his eightieth birthday some friends held a dinner in his honor in London; the speech he made there has been preserved and is characteristic of his sense of humor: ""I have been told that a good many people never reach the biblical span of three score years and ten; and those who do -- so some most reliable statistics assure us -- are most likely to die between 70 and 80. Hence I dare say ladies and gentlemen that I for one have now passed the danger zone and may well go on living forever."" He never gave up his love of brilliant chess. The same year that he gave that speech he took a brilliancy prize at Hastings. Mieses was one of the players awarded the GM title by FIDE in 1950 when they began to give retrospective acknowledgment to the great players of the previous generation. Arpad Elo estimates his peak performance rating at 2490. He died on February 23 1954 just four days short of his 89th birthday. For my second annotated game we go back to 1907 when Mieses was at the height of his powers and conjuring furiously with that Morphyesque flair that remained his trademark throughout his long career. His opponent here is the strong Russian player and theoretician Eugene Znosko-Borovsky."
46,2,1,e5,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6',"Ah !! before we go any further Please do not forget to rate and comment on this game. It helps me sense my audience's pulse and post more games of the kind that you like.

47,2,2,Nc3,b'rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',"Znosko-Borovsky is probably best remembered today for four books that served as texts for the pre-war generation of Soviet players: How to Play the Chess Openings The Middle Game in Chess How to Play Chess Endings and the delightful and irreverent How Not to Play Chess. Mieses too was the author of several books including The Chess Pilot Manual of the End Game and Instructive Positions from Master Chess. Mieses had a hearty dislike of ""long lines"" theoretical openings analyzed so deeply that anyone with a good memory could find his way through them. He would frequently trot out the Danish Gambit (2.d4 exd4 3.c3!?) in international competition. Here he heads for a variation of the Vienna Game that was not sufficiently well explored at that time. His opponent's unfamiliarity with this sideline soon nets Mieses a significant positional advantage."
48,2,3,Nc6,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',"Znosko-Borovsky passes up the opportunity to test Mieses with 3...Nxe4. While it is generally considered harmless for White to take the Knight with 4.Nxe4 Black gets back the piece back with 4...d5!. However white still retains a slight spatial advantage after this fork.

However  having studied his games I can safely assert that Mieses might well have been unafraid to do something 'different'. He might have essayed the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.Nf3!? Nxc3 5.dxc3 or the extremely complicated lines beginning with 4.Qh5!? Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5!? which lead to almost unfathomable tactics."
49,2,4,d3,b'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq -',As an interesting aside White often reaches this position via the Bishop's Opening without giving Black the opportunity to take on e4 thus: 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nc3 etc.
50,2,5,Bb4,b'r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq -',"Here 4...Bc5 would probably transpose into a King's Gambit Declined -- an opening however with which the veteran gambitteer Mieses could be expected to be familiar. Znosko-Borovsky's move is designed to start a fight in the center focused on the d5 square. By pinning White's N/c3 Black obtains presumptive control of d5 and is prepared to push his pawn there next move. After for example 5.Ne2 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5 Black has achieved the favorable ""Jump Formation"" in the center and can look forward to the middlegame with confidence thanks to his spatial advantage."

52,2,7,d6,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq -',This is such a natural-looking move that it is difficult to condemn it. Yet Alekhine in his annotations to the game Alekhine-Gregory St. Petersburg 1909 suggests that Black's strongest course is an immediate 5...h6! with the idea 6.Bxf6 Bxc3+! (before White can play Ne2) 7.bxc3 Qxf6 with equal chances. On the other hand if White were to meet 5...h6 with 6.Bh4 Black could continue 6...g5 7.Bg3 d5! and having driven off White's Bishop he would achieve his central goal and have no further worries.
53,2,8,Nge2,b'r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Now that Mieses has taken the time to defend the N/c3 with a fellow steed the idea of ...h6 is less appealing. White can recapture on c3 with a Knight and Black's Queen would be exposed after her recapture on f6 since White plans both Nd5 (hitting f6 and c7) and 0-0 with f4! coming.
54,2,9,Be6,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/4p1B1/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq -',The tension this move introduces is quite characteristic of Vienna and Giuoco Piano positions. Tarrasch was one of the first people to note that White should not as a rule capture on e6: although it doubles Black's pawns the pawns control important central squares (like d5 -- there's that square again!) and the open f-file is an asset for Black. The two paths most commonly taken are Bb3 defending the B comfortably with the a-pawn and Mieses's more daring plan here:
55,2,10,O-O,b'r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/4p1B1/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq -',Mieses simply completes his development. If Black captures on c4 White will have a death-grip on the d5 square. This is highly uncomfortable for Black! So Znosko-Borovsky puts the question to White's B/g5 instead. Yet perhaps the best move of all for Black is simply 7...Bxc3. This is a difficult point to understand unless you really grasp the niceties of the pawn formation. Black's darksquare Bishop is outside his pawn chain true: yet it hasn't much of a future where it stands. In the subsequent course of the game it serves as more of a punching bag for White than an offensive piece. Trading it off might have been the better part of valor.
56,2,11,Bxd5,b'r3k2r/ppp2pp1/2np1q1p/3bp3/1bB1P3/3P4/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq -',"Already the B/b4 looks like it is ""floating"" without a purpose. Mieses captures on d5 with his Bishop for a good reason. There is nothing to be gained immediately by kicking Black's N/c6 with a pawn; and long-term the pawn on d5 might become a liability. Mieses is planning to push f4 soon harassing Black's Queen and opening a critical file. Notice how weak the f7 square would be if there were no White f-pawn!"

Mieses could have avoided all of this with 14.d4! and 15.Rxf4 transposing into something like the game continuation without offering Black that opportunity.
61,2,16,1Qe7,b'r3k2r/p1p1qpp1/2p4p/2bp4/4PR2/3P4/PPP1N1PP/R2Q3K w kq -',Black ducks the challenge. Now White's plan rolls forward unhindered.
62,2,17,1d4,b'r3k2r/p1p1qpp1/2p4p/2bp4/3PPR2/8/PPP1N1PP/R2Q3K b kq -',What should White play if Black puts the Bishop on d6 now? 15...Bd6 is not the game continuation but it is worth looking at. The key to this position as is so often the case in chess is an undefended man -- here the pawn on c6. Black's problem is that his Bishop can be forced to go to an undefended square as well and White can then fork the B and the P. 16.e5 Bb4 17.c3 Ba5 18.Qa4 ... and Black must lose a piece since allowing the fork on c6 is out of the question. For this reason Black must put his Bishop on b6.
63,2,18,1Ng3,b'r3k2r/p1p1qpp1/1bp4p/3p4/3PPR2/6N1/PPP3PP/R2Q3K b kq -',Mieses consistently prepares for an assault on the King. Now 16...0-0? is poor since White has 17.Nf5! and 18.Qg4 with decisive threats on g7 and h6.
64,2,19,1O-O-O,b'2kr3r/p1p1qpp1/1bp4p/3p4/3PPR2/6N1/PPP3PP/R2Q3K w - -',Znosko-Borovsky is well aware that the Kingside is an unwelcome home for him so he spirits his King away to the other side. The castle on the west side of his domain is drafty but he counts on the fact that he has a clerical defender there and White's pieces are not aimed properly for an assault on the Queenside.
65,2,20,1e5,b'2kr3r/p1p1qpp1/1bp4p/3pP3/3P1R2/6N1/PPP3PP/R2Q3K b - -',"Now White threatens a positional crush with c3 and b4 burying Black's Bishop alive. Even with Black's King ""safe"" on the Queenside Black cannot hold the game if he is effectively a piece down. This positional threat is very real and it would be sheer suicide to permit White to carry it out. This helps to explain Black's next move which is otherwise an incomprehensible opening of lines against his own King."
66,2,21,Kb8,b'1k1r3r/p1p1qpp1/1b5p/3pP3/3P1R2/6N1/PP4PP/R2Q3K w - -',Black scurries off of the hot file and prepares ...c5 hoping to undermine White's center before Mieses has a chance to reorganize his forces. True the king is on an open file but Black has to act fast or White will lock down on c5 and Black will be practically speaking a piece down.
67,2,22,2a4,b'1k1r3r/p1p1qpp1/1b5p/3pP3/P2P1R2/6N1/1P4PP/R2Q3K b - a3',This threatens to win a piece however.

71,2,26,2Qe7,b'1k1r3r/2p1qpp1/1b5p/p2pP3/P2P1R2/6N1/6PP/1R1Q3K w - -',Now Mieses sets up a brilliant double-attack:

73,2,28,2Ka7,b'3r3r/k1p1qpp1/1b5p/p2pP3/P2P1R2/6N1/6PP/1R3Q1K w - -',Black judges that of the two threats Qa6 is the more deadly. White could play 24.Rxf7 now a good move but Mieses is ever searching for the most brilliant continuation. His search is rewarded with...
74,2,29,2Rxb6,b'3r3r/k1p1qpp1/1R5p/p2pP3/P2P1R2/6N1/6PP/5Q1K b - -',This stunning move enables Mieses to draw Black's King out into the open. Notice that 24...cxb6?? loses to Rxf7.
75,2,30,2Qxa5+,b'3r3r/k1p1qpp1/7p/Q2pP3/P2P1R2/6N1/6PP/7K b - -',Having garnered a B+P for the Rook Mieses already has back practically full compensation for the exchange. Of course he also sacrificed a pawn to open the b-file. But the open file is worth far more to White than the pawn is to Black.
76,2,31,2Rf1,b'3r3r/1kp1qpp1/7p/Q2pP3/P2P4/6N1/6PP/5R1K b - -',White switches sides effortlessly. This whole game exhibits a sort of grace in the attack for which Mieses was justly famous and well-beloved.
77,2,32,2Nf5,b'1r5r/1kp1qpp1/7p/Q2pPN2/P2P4/8/6PP/5R1K b - -',Naturally White wants to conduct this attack with all of his pieces not just with two.

79,2,34,3Rb1+,b'1r5r/1k3pp1/3pq2p/Q2pP3/P2P4/8/6PP/1R5K b - -',"Black resigns because he is losing his R/b8 e.g. Kc8: Qa6+ Kc7 Qa7+ Kd8 Rxb8+ A finely-calculated finish by Jacques Mieses chevalier sans peur et sans reproche! (A Knight without fear and without reproach.)

160,6,26,Bf6,b'5rk1/ppB4p/2p2b2/P4b2/8/2P4P/2PR1PP1/6K1 w - -',The power of the two Bishops is felt. White cannot defend both isolated QBP's.

162,6,28,Bc3,b'4r1k1/ppB4p/2p5/P1P2b2/8/2b4P/2PR1PP1/6K1 w - -',Now I drive the Rook and win the Pawn on White's QB2.
163,6,29,Re1+,b'6k1/ppB4p/2p5/P1P5/8/2b4P/2b2PP1/2R1r1K1 w - -',Forcing another piece exchange. White's Rook will vanish.
164,6,30,3a6,b'6k1/ppB4p/P1p5/2P5/8/7P/2b2PP1/4b1K1 b - -',This speeds White's doom. However the position is lost for White in any case.
165,6,31,3bxa6,b'6k1/p1B4p/p1p5/2P5/8/7P/2b2PP1/4b1K1 w - -',Now the QRP will march to victory.
166,6,32,Bc3,b'6k1/7p/1Bp5/2P5/p7/2b4P/2b2PP1/6K1 w - -',The final blow guarding QR8 and preventing the Bishop from stopping the Pawn.
167,6,33,a3,b'6k1/7p/1Bp5/2P5/8/p1b4P/2b2PP1/5K2 w - -',White resigns.
168,7,0,f3,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. f3 - unusual line.  Not the best move because it takes away the best square for white's king knight and more importantly opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal (e1-h4).  The Dentist must now watch out for a queen check on h4.  Better was 2. e5 (main line) or 2. Nc3 or even 2. d3.
169,7,1,Nxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4n3/P4P2/1PPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ..... Nxe4 - hmm this is gonna be like Damiano's Defense in reverse.  The main line of Damiano's Defense goes like this. 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3  f6?! 3. Nxe5 - it is best to decline the sacrifice by playing the Macgregor-Chigorin line with 3. ..... Qe7 - otherwise if the sac is accepted then this leads to black either losing the exchange losing 5 pawns or Copping Old Matey - do you still wanna accept this sacrifice?  Well with colours reversed the Dentist did just that!
170,7,2,fxe4,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',4. fxe4?? - see my previous note - I think Qe2 would have been better here.

172,7,4,Kg3,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4q3/P5K1/1PPP2PP/RNBQ1BNR b kq -',7. Kg3? - this is a mistake according to the gameknot analysis.  GK suggested d4 here although it gives up a pawn at least that move does open up a diagonal for the white dsb which will crucially defend the square f4 from a very nasty queen check there.
173,7,5,Qf4+,b'rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/5q2/P5K1/1PPP2PP/RNBQ1BNR w kq -',7. ..... Qf4+ - and indeed the BQ does land on that square!

Kg2 - The dentist played this move and then realised horror of horrors that he was about to be Freddied by the move Qf2#!  He then resigned the game on the grounds of unavoidable mate - I think he is yet unaware that Freddy expressly forbids resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate and frowns upon any resignation whatsoever.  After this The Dentist bravely challenges Master Freddy to another game I will soon be annotating about how he fares in Game 2 - well he loses but he does put up stronger resistance next time round - watch this space.

180,8,1,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Out comes the knight in particularly preventing 2. e4

182,8,3,e6,b'rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',Black plays the Nimzo-Indian defence controling the centre with pieces rather than pawns.

184,8,5,Bb4,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Black finds another way to prevent white from playing e4.
185,8,6,e3,b'rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The white king shoved the e pawn forwarded one space. This is The Rubinstein System (named after Akiba Rubinstein)
186,8,7,b6,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',Slightly unusual but perfectably playable. 0-0 and c5 are more common here.
187,8,8,f3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -',The white king pushes forward the f2 pawn one square. This again is unusual white's more common 5th moves in this position are Bd3 Nge2 Nf3 a3 Bd2 or Qc2. There is a certain logic to f3. It reduces the power of the Black bishop if it goes to b7 prevents Ne4 from black and prepares e4 for white. The down side is that it is not developing a piece and slightly weakening the white king side.
188,8,9,Nh5,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',So black moves his knight threatening Qh4 check. c5 is the only move here for black on the Gameknot databases.
189,8,10,Nh3,b'rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP1N/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq -',So white covers that and prepares to reply to the check with Nf2.

193,8,14,a3,b'rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/2p4n/1bPP4/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ -',So having played Bd2 this is a logical follow up if black exchanges on c3 my bishop is powerful on c3.
194,8,15,Ba5,b'rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/b1p4n/2PP4/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',So black retreats.

After the recapture white also has a backward b pawn and a weak square on b3 but this is less important as 1. It is further away from the centre the main scene of the action and 2. It will take time for black to line up pieces on the b file and move the knight towards b3. Black in fact never does this but white immediately starts making threats.
196,8,17,bxc5,b'rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/4p3/b1p4n/2P5/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',So black recaptures.

204,8,25,1Qe7,b'rnb2rk1/p2pqppp/1b2p3/2p5/2P2P2/P1B1P2N/1P4PP/R2QKB1R w KQ -',Black's queen supports the weak d6 square.

211,8,32,1Rac1,b'r1b2rk1/p2pq1pp/2n1p3/b1p2p1Q/2P2P2/P1BBP2N/1P4PP/2R2RK1 b - -',So white makes sure that his pawns are not doubled when the exchange comes in.
212,8,33,1Bd8,b'r1bb1rk1/p2pq1pp/2n1p3/2p2p1Q/2P2P2/P1BBP2N/1P4PP/2R2RK1 w - -',"I really don't understand this move. By moving to a5 first black has just lost a move.

Qxf7+ Kxf7 22. e4 Ba5 23. Bxa5 Nxa5 24. exf5. It also says as best for black Bxc3 17. Rxc3 Rb8 18. Rc2 g6 19. Qf3 a5 20. Rd2 Bb7 21. Qd1 d5 22. Ng5 h6 23. Nf3 Kg7. Well of course I didn't see all that but I thought the exchange on c3 was best for black and would have given approximate equality.

Then I saw that he is in more trouble than I thought. Advancing the d-pawn at this point would give way to my e-pawn which makes my bishop very powerful. So I figured he speculates on forking knight and bishop after some more preparatory moves and ...d5 finally.

At this stage of the game we were meeting in person and he frankly pointed out his anticipated knight route which included the juicy squares f5 and than look at the huge hole at g3!! Fortunately my attacking plan neatly addresses this issue.

(Note 24. ...Re8 can be dealt with via 25. Bb5.) No while writing this I found out that 25. g6 isn't a threat at all because it abandones the f5-square and White had to deal primarily with the big fork on g3 after 25. ...Nf5 thereby allowing ...Bg7. So actually at this point I haven't had a single positional advantage at all. My only surplus was the extra pawn. Until this knight move weakened the g6-pawn.

This sacrifice temporarily blocks the rook and gives way to the most potent protecter: the black queen. After 31. Rxe7 (renewing the threat of mate) there comes 31. ... Qg6 preventing the worst. But everything is lost material-wise after the fork 32. Qd5+ Kf8 (equally attacking the white rook). The zwischenzug 33. Re6 saves the white rook by attacking the black queen. And after 33. ...Qf7 the last black rook falls with check again: 34. Qxa7+. This leaves White with rook and pawn ahead and no obnoxious counterplay in sight. If yes if black hadn't decided to commit suicide.

He put both queen side pawns on black squares one under attack from a bishop one from another pawn. If your opponent only has one bishop it is frequently good to put your pawns on that color to restrict the bishop. On the other hand I always say there is an exception to every rule! His two queen side pawns are not stable enough. He ended up losing both pawns (one traded one taken for free) which left his king open to attack. To defend his king he had to sack his queen for a rook then white got a 2nd queen and it was downhill from there. I say instead of 30. ... a5 black had 2 feasible game plans at his disposal:

1. He could have played 30. ... Rd1 + as he did play on the next move after messing up his pawn structure! If 31. QxR then QxR. Or if 31. Ka2 then Qd5+. Blacks pawns would still be intact and his king a lot safer. He could then choose to play 32. ... b5 to keep the queen out.

2. Or he could have played 30. ... b5. With the pawns on white squares and white only having a DSB black's pawns would come under less attack. 

Black would then have a slightly inferior pawn structure. White would have a queen side pawn majority (3-2) black a king side pawn majority (4-3). White would have a passed c-pawn but it's well blockaded by a queen which would be hard to move since the rook can't get in the bishop is on dark squares and the queen if she gets in can be traded. Black has a backward g-pawn but it is well defended.

So the pawn inferiority would be hard to take advantage of in my opinion and black should have a good game."

About a month ago antagonistknight and I played this unrated game.  He started off with 1. f4 which was The Bird's Opening and I got the mischevious idea about me playing the black side of another of Freddy's Annotation's Project.  I lost this game but maybe some lessons can be learned from this and hopefully it will be a worthy contribution to the Project.  We will therefore pick up the action on Move 9.  Before I start this here is the gameknot analysis version of the game which will help you follow the game up to move 9.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14011633&fb=1&rnd=0.054344796625981295"
555,22,1,Bg7,b'rn1q3r/ppp1p1bp/2k3p1/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ -',9. ...... Bg7 - the most popular move of the project and it helps clear those back decks.
556,22,2,1Nc3,b'rn1q3r/ppp1p1bp/2k3p1/6N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ -',10. Nc3 - swift development is required with white having only 2 pieces for Glenda.
557,22,3,Qg8,b'rn4qr/ppp3bp/2k1N1p1/8/4ppB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',12. ...... Qg8 - Glenda takes the standard evasive action but she is rather passive on this square.
558,22,4,Nf6,b'r5qr/ppp3bp/2k1Nnp1/8/3PNpB1/8/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',14. ..... Nf6 - gameknot analysis said that was my first mistake.  It suggested as an alternative 14. ...... h5 - please refer to the link for further detail.
559,22,5,Bxf6,b'r5qr/ppp4p/2k1Nbp1/8/3P1pB1/8/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - -',15. ..... Bxf6 - I thought that trading knights would reduce white's firepower but alas it does not and white's dsb comes into the fray.
560,22,6,1Bg3,b'4r1qr/pppk3p/4Nbp1/3P4/6B1/6B1/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - -',18. Bg3 - this move now opens up a line for the WR on f1 to attack Fou Lenoir.
561,22,7,h5,b'4r1qr/ppp1k3/4Nbp1/3P3p/6B1/6B1/PPP3PP/4RRK1 w - h6',19. ....... h5 - too little too late now comes a nasty discovered check which will win the rook on e1 for starties.  Also Fou Lenoir is very vulnerable as if Henry goes onto f2 then he will be caught in a pin and all white has to do is pile on with a move such as Be5.  On making this assessment I waved the white flag.  Well played antagonistknight.

Rg6+ - at last here is the swinger - now guys and dolls just take a look at that h1-a8 diagonal and what is lined up on that a BR and a BQ so if Kh1?? here then Freddy will drop his queen to a move such as Re3 disc ch.

Here is Round 2 of the Dentist against Master Freddy.  The Dentist does better this time although he does create a few too many cavities with too many pawn moves and later on Freddy ensures he has a major dose of both heartache and toothache!   He starts off with a QP opening with 1.d4.  Before I go any further here is the Gameknot Analysis version for you to refer to as you run through the moves. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14069274&rnd=0.039215609280492836"
605,25,1,c5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6',1. ...... c5 - Freddy just lurves trying out gambits!
606,25,2,d5,b'rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq -',2. d5 - The Dentist declines the proferred c pawn and tries to use his d pawn to inhibit Freddy's pawns.
607,25,3,Nf6,b'rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/8/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',3. ..... Nf6 - after a bit of pawn play Freddy brings a knight out to put pressure on d5.

610,25,6,e4,b'rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P1P1/2P2P2/PP5P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',6. e4 - now he plays e4 - I think he had better start developing his pieces though.
611,25,7,Ra3,b'r1bqk2r/1p1nppb1/p2p1npp/2pP4/P3P1PP/R1P2P2/1P6/1NBQKBNR b Kkq -',9. Ra3 - a piece does develop but The Dentist violates opening principles and should be thinking about moving the minor pieces first though but I think he is trying to surprise and confuse Freddy though.
612,25,8,1Bf4,b'r1bqk2r/1p2ppb1/p2p1npp/2pPn3/P3PBPP/R1P2P2/1P6/1N1QKBNR b Kkq -',10. Bf4 - clap hands - finally a minor piece DOES emerge!

615,25,11,1b4,b'r1bqk2r/3nppb1/p5p1/PppPp1Pp/1P2P2P/R1P2P2/8/1N1QKBNR b Kkq b3',14. b4 - the Dentist just lurves to move those pawns!

617,25,13,1O-O,b'r1b2rk1/2qnppb1/p5p1/PppPp1Pp/1P2P2P/R1P2P2/7R/1N1QKBN1 w - -',15. ..... 0-0 - Freddy sure feels confident about castling into a pawn storm he might do it against The Dentist but would he dare against The Kitten?
618,25,14,1Qb3,b'r1b2rk1/3nppb1/p2q2p1/PppPp1Pp/1P2P2P/RQP2P2/3R4/1N2KBN1 b - -',17. Qb3 - now his queen moves but she could be asked to move again if Freddy plants a footman on c4.  Freddy has other ideas however with a pawn push to f5.
619,25,15,2Bxc4,b'r1b2rk1/3np1b1/p2q2p1/P2PppPp/1pB1P2P/1Q3P2/R2R4/1N2K1N1 b - -',20. Bxc4 - and now with the Dentist a pawn to the bad he finally develops his lsb!  Now just both his horsies remain at home.
620,25,16,2fxe4,b'r1b2rk1/3np1b1/p2q2p1/P2Pp1Pp/1pB1P2P/1Q6/R2R4/1N2K1N1 b - -',21. fxe4 - pawn trade - this does open the f file however and there is a black rook on it.  Now can Freddy make use of this.
621,25,17,2Nc5,b'r1b2rk1/4p1b1/p2q2p1/P1nPp1Pp/1pB1P2P/1Q6/R2R4/1N2K1N1 w - -',21. ..... Nc5! - setting a trap which alas The Dentist falls into in trying to restore material equality.  The pawn on b4 becomes highly toxic indeed.
622,25,18,Nd3+,b'r1b2rk1/4p1b1/p2q2p1/P2Pp1Pp/1QB1P2P/3n4/R2R4/1N2K1N1 w - -',22. ..... Nd3+!! - this move wins the WQ as it is a discovered attack.  The Dentist has nothing better than to capture the knight but the loss of the WQ proves fatal to white.  Here I would have waved the white flag faced with such a deficit.  The dentist chooses to play on just a little longer.

627,25,23,Qg1+,b'r4rk1/4p1b1/p5p1/P2Pp1Pp/4P2P/8/R2RB3/1N2K1q1 w - -',27. ..... Qg1+ - The Dentist can only interpose his lsb on f1.  Next move The Dentist will be Freddied by Qxf1#.  This was why I thought that 25. Nbc3 was better than Nec3.  However as I stated in my previous note it would have simply prolonged the agony.  The Dentist chose to wave the white flag here.  Although the Dentist made far too many pawn moves it wasn't until Move 18 that he fell behind on material and he did not have a completely lost position until Move 22.  Compare that with his 11 move loss against Freddy in the previous game.

You feel that you must win now in order to expunge the earlier mistake but putting yourself under extra pressure only makes it easier to make further mistakes. I've chosen a tennis theme for this annotation because the 2010 Wimbledon Championships were played while the game was in progress and this made me reflect on how the game was not unlike a tennis match with ""break points"" being missed by both sides."
629,26,1,Nc6,b'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq -',I do vary my openings a little but I'm most comfortable with good old ...Nc6 and that's especially what I'm most likely to play when my opponent's rating is lower than mine as here.

In essence it's a rally in which both sides are making sure the other never has the opportunity to grab the e-pawn or at least can't take much advantage by doing so.

If White does think Black intends this he may prefer to avoid this line with 8. a4 instead of c3. In this game however my opponent was not fooled by this little ruse so we immediately return to normal lines.

A logically motivated move as the bishop is denied g4 and so seeks development on the other diagonal putting pressure on White's currently underdefended pawn on e4. Of course White can defend this pawn with d3 but usually he does not play this as it would slow down the intended d4 break.
634,26,6,1Be3,b'r2qr1k1/1bp1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QR1K1 b - -',This seems a little strange. More common is 11. Nbd2 defending the targeted e4 square; d4 is already overprotected and the bishop is cutting the rook's defence of e4.

Unpinning the knight is not sufficient to save the d5 pawn but Black hopes to weather the storm and finish still a piece for two pawns up. To achieve this Black's pieces must be activated. Black could also be more daring and play 15... dxe4 to avoid losing the pawn but since this helps White bring his knight into play I wasn't keen on the idea.

It's a pity that my knight on d8 has no squares since it keeps the rook out of play as well. Anyhow White certainly won't want to exchange queens.

Translated into chess terms I now felt confident I had seen off the attack since various exchanges are threatened and the d8 knight is now free to come back into play.

(And this seems as good a point as any to clarify the situation surrounding this game. After player ""gringo67"" timed out all six of his games the group winner would depend entirely on the results of the games between the other three players always a tense situation. I lost one to greg_johnstone meaning that by the time only my two games with vladimir38 remained unfinished I had to get 1.5 points from the two games to win the group. In the other game I thought I had winning chances for a while but my opponent successfully defused them and got a passed pawn which I blockaded and then offered a draw on the grounds of opposite-coloured bishops. This was accepted leaving this game as an absolute must-win.)"

665,26,37,Qxa2,b'5rk1/3R1pp1/p3n3/1pp3P1/7P/4B1Q1/q4P2/6K1 w - -',...and drive the ball deep into the opposite corner of White's court. Now it looks as though White must succeed in his attack or else my pawns will give me an endgame win but it's not as simple as that this match has some distance to go yet!
666,26,38,c4,b'5rk1/3R1pp1/p3n3/1p4PP/2p5/4B1Q1/q4P2/6K1 w - -',I calmly advance the pawn; what else can I do? I want White to make the first move to the sixth rank so that I can block him...
667,26,39,g6,b'5rk1/3R1p2/p3n1pP/1p4P1/2p5/4B1Q1/q4P2/6K1 w - -',...which I do. The disadvantage is of course that my long diagonal is now open and could prove a serious weakness. At least for now the knight covers the d4 square.
668,26,40,4Qe5,b'5rk1/3R1p2/p3n1pP/1p2Q1P1/2p5/4B3/q4P2/6K1 b - -',White's thinking about the long diagonal too...
669,26,41,Qf5,b'5rk1/3R1p2/p3n1pP/1p2QqP1/2p5/4B3/5PK1/8 w - -',...but I knew that I had this means of getting back to defend if White tried that.
670,26,42,gxf5,b'5rk1/3R1p2/p3n2P/1p3pP1/2p5/4B3/5PK1/8 w - -',Now I felt I had excellent winning chances with the queens off...
671,26,43,4Bd2,b'5rk1/3R1p2/p3n2P/1p3pP1/2p5/8/3B1PK1/8 b - -',...but White still isn't giving up! This move is clearly aiming to get onto the long diagonal...
672,26,44,4Kh7,b'5r2/3R1p1k/p3n2P/1p3pP1/2p5/8/3B1PK1/8 w - -',...and this hasty sidestep is necessary to prevent 44. g6!
673,26,45,Nc5,b'5r2/R4p1k/p6P/1pn2pP1/2p5/8/3B1PK1/8 w - -',I move to defend the threatened a-pawn but this turns out to be another blunder...
674,26,46,4Bb4,b'5r2/R4p1k/p6P/1pn2pP1/1Bp5/8/5PK1/8 b - -',...since although this pin doesn't win material it does force my rook away from defending the f-pawn.

White has actually helped me get my rook behind my furthest advanced pawn and I'm willing to let the f7 pawn go. Overconfident because in a few moves from now I'll allow White to play the exact same winning line again.
677,26,49,c3,b'2r5/R4p1k/p6P/1p3pP1/5P2/2pn4/3B2K1/8 w - -',This move forces the issue...
678,26,50,Kg6,b'2r5/5R2/p5kP/1p3pP1/5P2/2pn4/3B2K1/8 w - -',...and I had a very sleepless night after playing this move! I'd only considered 49. Rg7+ Kh5 50. h7 cxd2 51. Rg8 when both sides promote and I keep the extra knight but instead the simple decoy 49. Rg7+ Kh5 50. Bxc3!! wins on the spot.
679,26,51,4Rf6+,b'2r5/8/p4RkP/1p3pP1/5P2/2pn4/3B2K1/8 b - -',White misses it!
680,26,52,5Rd6,b'2r5/7k/p2R3P/1p3pP1/5P2/2pn4/3B2K1/8 b - -',And after neither of us has succeeded in winning a break point this good move forces the exchange of minor pieces (at least I can't see that Black has much alternative) thus taking the match to a tie-break.
681,26,53,Rc4,b'8/7k/p6P/1p3pP1/2r2P2/3R4/3p2K1/8 w - -',First point to Black. This is a more promising move than the more obvious ...Rc2 since the d-pawn is dead anyway and the tempo gained on White's f-pawn allows Black to advance the pawns and get the roo
682,26,54,b3,b'8/7k/p6P/5pP1/2r2P2/1p3K2/3R4/8 w - -',Now material is level and I was expecting that the game would probably be drawn. My outside passed pawn couple is nice but my king can't get away to help them. However it turns out...
683,26,55,a5,b'8/7k/7P/p4pP1/1r3P2/1p2K3/1R6/8 w - -',...that the passed pawns are stronger than I realised! White can't move the king across to threaten them without letting the f-pawn go but certainly if this pawn reaches a3 Black has won.
684,26,56,Rxf4,b'8/7k/7P/5pP1/p4r2/1pK5/1R6/8 w - -',Another point to Black. White will have to come up with a good serve now...

686,26,58,6Rf4,b'8/7k/7P/5pr1/p4R2/1pK5/8/8 b - -',This seems to be all White can do; if 60. Rh2 then 60... f4 61. Kb4 f3 62. Kxa4 Rg2 wins.
687,26,59,6Kxh6,b'8/8/7k/5pr1/p4R2/1pK5/8/8 w - -',Another point to Black. At first sight 60... Rg4 might seem superior as it keeps the connected pawn pair but in fact the far-apart pawns give Black a stronger advantage. White's king can't easily keep both under control and Black's king is close to the f-pawn.
688,26,60,Rg3+,b'8/8/7k/5p2/R7/1pK3r1/8/8 w - -',Black doesn't want to let the b-pawn go if he can help it!

690,26,62,6Ra3,b'8/8/8/5pk1/8/Rp4r1/1K6/8 b - -',White commits a fault with this move; there is no threat to win the b-pawn since if he takes Black exchanges rooks with an easy win. More enterprising is 63... Ra8.
691,26,63,6Rg2+,b'8/8/8/5pk1/8/Rp6/1K4r1/8 w - -',Black capitalises (though it's unnecessarily flashy; 63... f4 wins faster). White still can't take the b-pawn because of Rg3+. Match point.
692,26,64,f4,b'8/8/8/6k1/5p2/1R6/1p4r1/1K6 w - -',A key move: Black advances the pawn before the king so that if White exchanges on b2 the pawn is within range to promote unaided.
693,26,65,6Rxb2,b'8/8/8/6k1/5p2/8/1R4r1/1K6 b - -',But White realises he now has no way to stop Black promoting one or other pawn and gracefully makes a final exhibition shot allowing Black to smash home the winner. What an exciting game it was!

704,27,9,1f4,b'3r4/pbq1pk1p/6p1/7n/3b1P2/2NP3P/PPP3PK/R2Q1R2 b - -',Not Nxf4 because then g3 and i drop my knight
705,27,10,e5,b'3r4/pbq3kp/6p1/4p2n/3b1P2/2NP2PP/PPP4K/R2Q1R2 w - e6',I think this move just seals whites fate. If fxe5 then Qxe5 threatens mate and if f5 then Bxc3 and e4 also threaten mate
706,27,11,2fxg6,b'3r4/pbq3kp/6P1/7n/4p3/2PP2PP/P1P4K/R2Q1R2 b - -',a terrible blunder
707,27,12,e3+,b'3r4/pb4kp/6P1/7n/8/2PPp1qP/P1P5/R2Q1R1K w - -',white resigns 0-1
708,28,0,g6,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -',A rather tricky way to reply to 1. d4. If I would have played c4 and tried to go for a KID setup my opponent would have had the chance to delay the development of the Ng8 until he would have played f5 or f6 thus saving quite a few tempos in a normal position.
709,28,1,e4,b'rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3',Lucky for me I love semi-open position and decided that the c-pawn could stay in its place for now.
710,28,2,Nc6,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -',A rather strange plan. The early development of the Queen's Knight is rather rare because the pressure on d4 can be easily parried and Black is left with a lack of space and means to attack my pawn centre.
711,28,3,Be3,b'r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq -',I wanted to keep the possibility of playing f4 and there is no danger on the long diagonal since Black's c-pawn isn't taking part in the struggle for the centre.
712,28,4,e6,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',I recently read a post on a chess forum about the Universal Attack which would be best summed-up by developing pieces behind pawns. I've played and crushed plenty of players that would try to develop on this way. But they were patzers and my opponent wasn't so I needed to be careful and not overextend myself.
713,28,5,f4,b'r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq f3',I just love pushing the pawn to f5 in these kind of positions. It usually means your attack is on its way and your opponent is soon going to be in deep trouble.
714,28,6,a6,b'r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pbp/p1n1p1p1/8/3PPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq -',Black sure is taking his time. The plan with a6 and b5 works better when there is pressure on e4. That isn't the case here so playing like this seems a little artificial.
715,28,7,Bd3,b'r1bqk1nr/2pp1pbp/p1n1p1p1/1p6/3PPP2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq -',Since b4 isn't a real threat there is no need to weaken to Q-side with moves like a3 giving my opponent opportunities to open lines there. Especially since I planed to castle that way in a bit.
716,28,8,O-O-O,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppnpbp/p1n1p1p1/1p6/3PPP2/2NBBN2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - -',The Kings have signalled that it's going to be an all out war. I felt really good about my position because thanks to Black's first move I should have the upper-hand in opening lines first. On top of that I am better developed so any active operations would find me better placed to seize the advantage.
717,28,9,1Ne2,b'r1bq1rk1/2ppnpbp/p1n1p1p1/8/1p1PPP2/3BBN2/PPPQN1PP/2KR3R b - -',No problem. Black doesn't have any pieces to attack with and I can start to push the K-side pawns soon. My Knight will be more useful there.
718,28,10,1d5,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1npbp/p1n1p1p1/3p4/1p1PPP2/3BBN2/PPPQN1PP/2KR3R w - d6',Fixing the centre before a flank attack. I still don't trust Black's position. It just seems too slow.
719,28,11,1Kb1,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1npbp/2n1p1p1/p2pP3/1p1P1P2/3BBN2/PPPQN1PP/1K1R3R b - -',Perhaps it wasn't necessary here but in most cases this King moves proves its usefulness later on.
720,28,12,1g4,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1npbp/2n1p1p1/3pP3/pp1P1PP1/3BBN2/PPPQN2P/1K1R3R b - g3',Time to get my own pawn storm going.

There is an old saying in chess that has been proven time and again. Don't make needless pawn moves on the flank where you are weaker. Because my pawns were on their starting squares I can block the position and deflate Black's attack while he can't do the same about my pawn-thrusting ideas.
723,28,15,1c3,b'r1bq1rk1/2p1npbp/4p1p1/n2pP3/p2P1PP1/PpPBBN2/1P1QN2P/1K1R3R b - -',Now there are two rows of pawns protecting my King.

725,28,17,1Qd7,b'r1b2rk1/2pqnpbp/4p1p1/3pP3/p1nP1PP1/PpPBBN2/1P2N2P/1KQR3R w - -',Probably to come to b5 and to hold f5 after he develops his Bc8.

728,28,20,f6,b'r4rk1/2pqn1bp/b4pp1/3pPP2/p1nP4/PpPBBNN1/1P5P/1KQR3R w - -',A rather sad move to make but almost forced. 19...gxf5 loses right away to 20. Bg5 while the attempt to exchange pieces then capture on f5 still leads to disaster 19...Nxe3 20. Qxe3 Bxd3+ 21. Qxd3 gxf5 22. Nh5!
729,28,21,2Bh6,b'r4rk1/2pqn1bp/b4ppB/3pPP2/p1nP4/PpPB1NN1/1P5P/1KQR3R b - -',Exchanging the best defender of the King. The fact that Black can win a pawn here is unimportant as that would only expose his King to all sorts of threats and gluttony would soon prove a deadly sin.
730,28,22,2dxe5,b'r4rk1/2pqn2p/b5pQ/3pPP2/p1n5/PpPB1NN1/1P5P/1K1R3R b - -',Better than 22. Bxc4 since this position is much more dangerous with Queens on the board for Black than it is for me.
731,28,23,2Nxa3+,b'r4rk1/2pqn2p/b5pQ/3pPP2/p7/npPB1NN1/1P5P/1K1R3R w - -',The only way to expose my King and create some counterplay. Otherwise Black would just be forced to watch his King get squashed.
732,28,24,Nxf5,b'r4rk1/2pq3p/6pQ/3pPn2/p7/PpPR1NN1/7P/1K5R w - -',Black has two pawns for a piece but my pieces aren't on their best squares and I'll need some time to regroup. Also if he can expose my King he'll have enough counterplay to balance the small material disadvantage.
733,28,25,2Qh3,b'r4rk1/2pq3p/6p1/3pPn2/p7/PpPR1NNQ/7P/1K5R b - -',I didn't want any more pieces being exchange for now.
734,28,26,2Qe7,b'r4rk1/2p1q2p/6p1/3pPn2/p7/PpPR1NNQ/7P/1K5R w - -',Escaping the pin and attacking my weak pawn on a3.
735,28,27,2Kb2,b'r4rk1/2p1q2p/6p1/3pPn2/p7/PpPR1NNQ/1K5P/7R b - -',Forced.
736,28,28,2Ng7,b'r4rk1/2p1q1np/6p1/3pP3/p7/PpPR1NNQ/1K5P/7R w - -',Preparing to blockade the pawn on e6 and hopefully advance the central pawns and open some lines on the Q-side.
737,28,29,2Rf1,b'r4rk1/2p1q1np/6p1/3pP3/p7/PpPR1NNQ/1K5P/5R2 b - -',Overprotecting the Knight and bringing more piece into play.
738,28,30,2Rad8,b'3r1rk1/2p1q1np/6p1/3pP3/p7/PpPR1NNQ/1K5P/5R2 w - -',Now that the d3 Rook wasn't tied to defence Black needs to defend his pawn as well.
739,28,31,2Rdd1,b'3r1rk1/2p1q1np/6p1/3pP3/p7/PpP2NNQ/1K5P/3R1R2 b - -',Again not the most obvious move I was still aiming to improve the position of my pieces while avoiding exchanges.
740,28,32,2c6,b'3r1rk1/4q1np/2p3p1/3pP3/p7/PpP2NNQ/1K5P/3R1R2 w - -',I think this was my opponent's last mistake. It's just too slow. 28...c5 was better since then Black's pawn chain the Q-side could be secured and the d4 square was not available for a White Knight.
741,28,33,2Qg4,b'3r1rk1/4q1np/2p3p1/3pP3/p5Q1/PpP2NN1/1K5P/3R1R2 b - -',Now the a4 pawn cannot be defended properly.
742,28,34,2c5,b'3r1rk1/4q1np/6p1/2ppP3/p5Q1/PpP2NN1/1K5P/3R1R2 w - -',Almost an admission of mistake. After 29...Ra8 30. Nd4 Black's counterplay stops.
743,28,35,3Qxa4,b'3r1rk1/4q1np/6p1/2ppP3/Q7/PpP2NN1/1K5P/3R1R2 b - -',A double-edged decision since now the a-file is open but that pawn chain had to be dismantled.
744,28,36,3Ne6,b'3r1rk1/4q2p/4n1p1/2ppP3/Q7/PpP2NN1/1K5P/3R1R2 w - -',Now Black is ready to activate his pieces at the expense of my King and Queen.
745,28,37,3Ne2,b'3r1rk1/4q2p/4n1p1/2ppP3/Q7/PpP2N2/1K2N2P/3R1R2 b - -',Putting another piece in control of d4.
746,28,38,3Qb7,b'3r1rk1/1q5p/4n1p1/2ppP3/Q7/PpP2N2/1K2N2P/3R1R2 w - -',With the idea of Ra8 while not allowing Qc6.
747,28,39,3Qg4,b'3r1rk1/1q5p/4n1p1/2ppP3/6Q1/PpP2N2/1K2N2P/3R1R2 b - -',Retracing my steps and hitting the Ne6.
748,28,40,3Qa6,b'3r1rk1/7p/q3n1p1/2ppP3/6Q1/PpP2N2/1K2N2P/3R1R2 w - -',Moving on the a-file protecting the Ne6 and attacking a Knight of my own.
749,28,41,3Nd2,b'3r1rk1/7p/q3n1p1/2ppP3/6Q1/PpP5/1K1NN2P/3R1R2 b - -',Now a3 could be defended by a Knight on b1 and the tension on the f-file makes Ra8 less of a threat.
750,28,42,3c4,b'3r1rk1/7p/q3n1p1/3pP3/2p3Q1/PpP5/1K1NN2P/3R1R2 w - -',Defending the b3 pawn but also giving me the the d4 square.
751,28,43,3Rf6,b'3r1rk1/7p/q3nRp1/3pP3/2p3Q1/PpP5/1K1NN2P/3R4 b - -',Forcing the exchange of a pair of Rooks even if that means the e5 pawn will soon be lost.
752,28,44,3Rxf6,b'3r2k1/7p/q3nrp1/3pP3/2p3Q1/PpP5/1K1NN2P/3R4 w - -',Forced because Rxg6 was a less obvious but more deadly threat.
753,28,45,Nc5,b'3r2k1/7p/q4Pp1/2np4/2p3Q1/PpP5/1K1NN2P/3R4 w - -',The Knight is closing in on my King.
754,28,46,3Nxc4,b'3r2k1/7p/q4Pp1/2np4/2N3Q1/PpP5/1K2N2P/3R4 b - -',The pawn chain is dismantled once again.
755,28,47,3Qxf6,b'3r2k1/7p/5qp1/2np4/2N3Q1/PpP5/1K2N2P/3R4 w - -',Black still has ideas of Rb8 and Na4 so it's time to exchange the Queens.
756,28,48,3Rd2,b'3r2k1/7p/5qp1/2np4/2N3Q1/PpP5/1K1RN2P/8 b - -',This small Rook lift makes sure there won't be any threats on the e-file. 
757,28,49,3h5,b'3r2k1/8/5qp1/2np3p/2N3Q1/PpP5/1K1RN2P/8 w - h6',A pawn advance with tempo that might prove useful later on. The Nc4 still can't be capture because of Qxc4+ and the piece is recaptured immediately after 37...dxc4 38. Qxc4+ Kg7 39. Rxd8+ Qxd8 40. Nd4! (a strong intermediate move) If. 38...Kh8 then 39. Rxd8+ Qxd8 40. Qxc5 and the threat of mate on f8 doesn't give Black time to recapture the Ne2 with Qd2+.
758,28,50,3Qf4,b'3r2k1/8/5qp1/2np3p/2N2Q2/PpP5/1K1RN2P/8 b - -',Proposing the Queen exchange.
759,28,51,3Qe6,b'3r2k1/8/4q1p1/2np3p/2N2Q2/PpP5/1K1RN2P/8 w - -',I had a long thought at this position and decided that now was the time to return the material and enter the endgame.
760,28,52,3Ne3,b'3r2k1/8/4q1p1/2np3p/5Q2/PpP1N3/1K1RN2P/8 b - -',I think this is the only move that wins consistently. After everything else Black has good chances to secure a draw.
761,28,53,3Rf8,b'5rk1/8/4q1p1/2np3p/5Q2/PpP1N3/1K1RN2P/8 w - -',After 39...d4 I had analysed 40. Nxd4 Na4+ 41. Ka1 Qe7 42. Nd1 Qxa3+ 43. Kb1 Nxc3+ 44. Nxc3 Ra8 45. Nc2 bxc2 46. Kxc2 Rab 47. Qd4 and Black can't keep the Queens on the board for much longer. 
762,28,54,4Qd4,b'5rk1/8/4q1p1/2np3p/3Q4/PpP1N3/1K1RN2P/8 b - -',This line that was played is almost forced and made it easier in choosing it and in evaluating the resulting endgame.
763,28,55,4Ne4,b'5rk1/8/4q1p1/3p3p/3Qn3/PpP1N3/1K1RN2P/8 w - -',The Knight was under attack and this was the best place it could go.
764,28,56,Ng5,b'6k1/8/4q1p1/3p2np/3Q4/PpP1N3/1K2Nr1P/4R3 w - -',With the idea of Nf3.
765,28,57,Nf3,b'6k1/8/6p1/3N3p/8/PpP2n2/1K2Nr1P/4R3 w - -',Now Black equalizes in material but is left with a worse endgame. That's what I thought. In fact White is winning after...
766,28,58,4a4,b'6k1/8/6p1/3N3p/P7/1KP2n2/7r/3R4 b - -',This was as far as I'd gone with my analysis of 39. Ne3 and I knew that the passed pawns supported by the King were much more dangerous that Black's pawns. In fact I am almost playing a piece up because my King is taking part in the game whilst Black's isn't doing anything.
767,28,59,Ne4,b'6k1/8/6p1/P2N4/1K2n2p/2P5/7r/3R4 w - -',Black already has problems in keeping my a-pawn from promoting.
768,28,60,5Kc5,b'6k1/8/3n2p1/P1KN4/7p/2P5/7r/4R3 b - -',The final touch. A King is a great supporter of passed pawns while a Knight is poor at stopping their advance.
769,28,61,5Nb7+,b'6k1/1n6/6p1/P1KN4/7p/2P5/7r/4R3 w - -',After this move my opponent resigned. After 52. Kb6 he doesn't have anything better than 52...Nxa5 after which the c-pawn will start marching down the board. Here is a sample line of what could have followed 53. Kxa5 h3 54. c4 Rg2 55. Rh1 Rg3 56. c5 Rg5 57. Rxh3! (the Knight is redundant the King is more important piece) Rxd5 58. Kb6

If you have read about my unnecessary concession of a Low Draw against my Class D buddy The Dentist due to some optical illusions then spare a thought for my former Class B opponent dmaestro.  In this game Glenda scared him into waving the white flag with her imposing presence on the h column.   At least I only gave away half a point - at least dmaestro also has the consolation of the game being unrated however.   But gameknot analysis will show that he did have a defense to my mating attack.  Here is the link to the Gameknot Analysis version:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14125809&rnd=0.0035182255284116892.  Anyway on with the game in which I decided to experiment with the Sargossa opening which is 1. c3."

If you look at Gameknot Analysis black still has a clear edge over me so I have won a lost position - isn't Jo a lucky so and so!  Do you the jury agree?

Even tho i feared Nh4 to create weaknesses on the king side i decided that my king really needs to get in to the game. and as long as i stay on light squares i should be ok. as you see most of my pieces are on light squares to avoid the dark squared bishop. Now you are probably wondering also why not Nc3? well i feared the let go of the d4 and d6 squares and decided that i can play that move maybe later but first getting my king up is my main objective. Getting the knight off the center was a scary thing to doi decided it is on an ok outpost at the moment.
879,33,3,3Bc5,b'5k2/2B3p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/7P/P3KPP1/8 w - -',Bc5. Well the bishop is simply better placed on c5 than on e7. Now it is targeting the f2 pawn preventing my king from moving to d3 which was my plan (d3-e4-d5 to support that passed pawn). also he is using a trickhe is blockading my passed pawns and that is an excellent thing to do in the end game.
880,33,4,3Kf3,b'5k2/2B3p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/5K1P/P4PP1/8 b - -',i have to go to f3 instead if i want to move up. The downside with this move is that it is blocking in the f2 pawn. however i wasn't planning to camp on f3 anyways.
881,33,5,3Ke7,b'8/2B1k1p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/5K1P/P4PP1/8 w - -',now he is moving his king closer to the center. the second point is moving to e6 (out of my bishop's range and protecting that knight)
882,33,6,3Ke4,b'8/2B1k1p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1K3/7P/P4PP1/8 b - -',see? told you i wasn't going to stay on f3. moving the king to the center was my point all a long.
883,33,7,3Ke6,b'8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1K3/7P/P4PP1/8 w - -',just defending the knight while attacking f2 on the same time
884,33,8,3f4,b'8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1KP2/7P/P5P1/8 b - f3',i decided the the most important thing to do here is Not letting his king come in to the 5th rank. exchanging pawns remove the pressure and making my king more elastic on the 4th rank. in the end game you don't want to give up ranksthey are important as well as seizing a file in the middle game.
885,33,9,3Ng3+,b'8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1p3/p1P1KP2/6nP/P5P1/8 w - -',well we could expect this movepushing my king back

888,33,12,3Ke4,b'8/6p1/4kp1p/1Nb2n2/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - -',this position is better for white than a few moves backall his pieces are out of the white squares expect the dark squared bishop. 
889,33,13,3Ne7,b'8/4n1p1/4kp1p/1Nb5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 w - -',This move was a mistake. firstly he over looked my next move which is strong secondly he is moving away from the center and now i am trying to use the center to grind him down making him cramped until he will have no way out and this is interesting to see.
890,33,14,3Nc7+,b'8/2N1n1p1/4kp1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - -',a good move of course now it isn't possible to play Nc3 but i was really afraid of playing Nc3moving pieces away from the center. but this move pushes his king back which is the first step of taking out my foe.
891,33,15,3Kd7,b'8/2Nkn1p1/5p1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 w - -',Kd7 Best move here but now comes a good move
892,33,16,4Na6,b'8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - -',Na6. I am knocking off that bishop from blockading my passed pawns and now things become to heat up.
893,33,17,4Bg1,b'8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/8/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 w - -',well in this position exchanging his dark squared bishop for my knight is just loosing for him since it is generally known a bishop is better than a knight.
894,33,18,4c5,b'8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/2P5/p3KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 b - -',c5. now i am planning to move my pawn to queen. Look on the difference on the position now and after 38. Ke4. he has two pieces pushed down.
895,33,19,4Kc6,b'8/4n1p1/N1k2p1p/2P5/p3KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 w - -',blockading the pawn with his king a king is a good blockader in the very end game due to if it gets knocked off it can simply move one step backwards and it will take time queening that passed pawn.
896,33,20,4Bd6,b'8/4n1p1/N1kB1p1p/2P5/p3K3/7P/P5P1/6b1 b - -',another pushing move. it also protects that c5 pawn
897,33,21,4Bf8,b'2n2B2/6p1/N1k2p1p/2P5/p3K3/7P/P5P1/6b1 b - -',now do you see why it's better to have pieces on light squares against a dark squared bishop? i believe the Bishop is excellent placed on f8 even if those three pawns under him wouldn't be there.
898,33,22,4Bh2,b'2n2B2/6p1/N1k2p1p/2P5/p3K3/7P/P5Pb/8 w - -',i think he wanted to move his bishop to e5 or something like the just preventing my king from assisting the blocked passed pawn.

902,33,26,4a3,b'2n2B2/2k3p1/2P2p1p/3K4/1N6/p6P/P5Pb/8 w - -',he didnt know what else to do.
903,33,27,4Bxg7,b'2n5/2k3B1/2P2p1p/3K4/1N6/p6P/P5Pb/8 b - -',I was really confused what to do in this position. i didnt want to let go of the e7 and d6 squares but i couldn't see any other move to advance my pawn. that's why i decided to just win materiali figured nothing bad would happen.
904,33,28,4Bd6,b'2n5/2k3B1/2Pb1p1p/3K4/1N6/p6P/P5P1/8 w - -',attacking the knight sharply

1011,39,3,a6,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppnppb1/p2p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ -',It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center. Since the dark-squared bishop is off the c1/h6-diagonal the c3 knight is vulnerable making a queenside pawn storm less likely at this point. So I opted for a6 instead of a5.
1012,39,4,Qc2,b'r1bq1rk1/1ppnppb1/p2p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ -',White keeps the option of castling either side. Good move. Plus he wants to exert pressure along my g6 pawn. At this point I hoped he'd castle longside since the black pawn moves ...e5 and ...f5 are very hard to accomplish.

In fact from studying my opponents games I just expected this since he is more into tactical play and often sacrifices pawns and material in general. A positional approach with 10. 0-0 would have been harder to come by.

I actually prepared for:
